1
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:18,715
<i>After the Terror wars,
Governments fell.</i>

2
00:00:20,215 --> 00:00:22,134
<i>Corporations took control,</i>

3
00:00:22,134 --> 00:00:24,595
<i>fighting over what remained.</i>

4
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:44,320
<i>Eight companies survived and
divided up the world.</i>

5
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:48,448
<i>Those companies were collectively
known as IRON FIST.</i>

6
00:00:54,118 --> 00:00:58,081
<i>The American territories fell
to the mightiest corporation of all,</i>

7
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:59,791
<i>Tekken.</i>

8
00:01:02,627 --> 00:01:05,212
<i>Once a year,
they hosted a tournament...</i>

9
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:08,340
<i>which was no game. Kill or be killed.</i>

10
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:14,553
<i>Outside the walls of Tekken city</i>

11
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:16,597
<i>in the burned up slums
they call the Anvil...</i>

12
00:01:18,682 --> 00:01:20,308
<i>That's where it all started.</i>

13
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,126
Tekken

14
00:01:55,336 --> 00:01:58,256
<i>5 days earlier</i>

15
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:47,064
Anvil.... Sector 197742-C7-443

16
00:05:02,993 --> 00:05:04,579
Open up!

17
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:13,753
I told you to use the side entrance.

18
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:15,922
I have knocked, nobody answered.

19
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:17,715
I can't hear anything over
all these whole din.

20
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:19,467
Hey! This is real music,

21
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:21,301
not that corporate shit they're
playing in the city.

22
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:23,553
What was that song you're
playing last week?

23
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:26,431
-The Roaches?
-The Beatles!

24
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,809
You see what I am talking about? Lost
of art! The end of creative thought.

25
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:35,230
- What happened to you?
- It's nothing.

26
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:38,232
You're the only one who
gets through the gang zones.

27
00:05:38,232 --> 00:05:40,609
- I don't know how you do it.
- I guess I am motivated.

28
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:44,112
What you are Jin, is a believer in the
cause. You just don't know it.

29
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:45,572
I am not a joiner, Bonner!

30
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:47,990
Come on man! Play your cards right!

31
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,117
One day... these could all be yours.

32
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:06,381
20,000 gigs. Get's some serious speed
with this.

33
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:08,800
- For what?
- Secret internet...

34
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,135
new underground,
of the Tekken subgrid.

35
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:12,261
Sorry I asked.

36
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:14,221
Used to be you had a choice.
free market, justice system...

37
00:06:14,221 --> 00:06:15,722
Now, everything's Tekken.

38
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:16,326
Look... just save the speech

39
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:18,996
...until after you paid me.
- Woah...

40
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:26,314
Keep the change.

41
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:29,525
What's this, Bonner?

42
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:31,527
You said global dollars.

43
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:33,153
I say a lot of things... I drinks...

44
00:06:33,153 --> 00:06:34,571
You said 'Global' dollars.

45
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,309
Oh...

46
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,328
We good?

47
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:45,664
Now, we're good.

48
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,791
- When you going to need another run?
- Don't know.

49
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:52,086
Iron Fist coming up.
Jack Hammer is cracking down.

50
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,755
Now you're talking.

51
00:06:54,755 --> 00:06:57,465
Jin, get back! How about another one?

52
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,679
<i>Disciplinary Unit Instructions!</i>

53
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:12,520
<i>Fallen... through discpline.
Peace... through grace!</i>

54
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:16,982
<i>These are the goals
demonstrated each year</i>

55
00:07:17,898 --> 00:07:19,734
<i>in Iron Fist tournament.</i>

56
00:07:20,318 --> 00:07:23,279
<i>These reigning champions
for the past four years...</i>

57
00:07:24,363 --> 00:07:28,867
<i>We are honored
to host the Iron Fist tournament</i>

58
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:31,077
<i>in Tekken city.</i>

59
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,038
<i>Strength through order!</i>

60
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,292
<i>That is Tekken!</i>

61
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:44,421
<i>Thank you for your loyal listening
and appreciation.</i>

62
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:51,719
<i>There are just two days left before
the kick off the Iron Fist tournament.</i>

63
00:07:52,427 --> 00:07:54,096
<i>That's right, there's two days left!</i>

64
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:56,807
<i>And how could you begin back where
it all started, here in Tekken City.</i>

65
00:07:57,181 --> 00:08:00,310
-With Iron Fist I can go in...
-Ahhh... too early to tell.

66
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:11,194
- How's my tab?
- You're up to $350.

67
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:13,738
Tap out.

68
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:17,115
- How about now?
- Ooh!

69
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:19,451
That's why you're my
favorite customer.

70
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:20,868
Catch you later!

71
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:25,456
- Hey!
- Hey!

72
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:28,125
You got anything interesting?

73
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:31,398
Everything I got is interesting to
somebody. You know what I mean?

74
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:35,631
- How about coffee?
- Coffee...

75
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:39,134
Yeah. Coffee!

76
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:44,930
- That's 100 an ounce.
- Jesus!

77
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,120
Hey man! This none of that free drive

78
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,705
step going into them bullshit,
you know what I mean?

79
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:52,145
You know what they used
to call Columbian?

80
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:55,689
That's what that is right there,
this is the good shit, my friend!

81
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:57,149
Alright.

82
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:00,944
Give me one of those oranges too.
And a bar of chocolate.

83
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:04,155
Aww... business must be booming.

84
00:09:04,655 --> 00:09:06,365
That will $200 Tekken ring.

85
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:09,117
-How bout a $100 global blue?
-That will work.

86
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,205
Nice doing business with you.

87
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:15,831
Always.

88
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,126
Hey Jin! Haven't seen you around man!

89
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,252
Been busy.

90
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:24,839
- Thought of anymore better offer?
- No! Sorry.

91
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,882
Hey! Just wait a minute, man!

92
00:09:26,882 --> 00:09:28,508
You're tough, man!

93
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:31,553
- I used to watch you street fighting.
- That was for money.

94
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:33,346
And this is for a cause.

95
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:36,348
Heihachi Mishima and his Tekken
gestapo treat us like slaves.

96
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:38,850
I have got my own life, my own problems.

97
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,039
I told you man, this asshole is...

98
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,561
...a waste of time.
-No... no!

99
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:44,480
He's just another punk who'd rather
die in the Anvil

100
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,981
than stand up like a man.

101
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:50,735
Hey! Hey man!

102
00:10:14,756 --> 00:10:16,757
Is everything prepared?

103
00:10:16,757 --> 00:10:19,551
Representative fighters are en route
from their home corporations.

104
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:21,511
Good! Good!

105
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,617
I am transferring command on
Tekken Jack Hammer

106
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:25,598
to you for the duration of
the tournament.

107
00:10:27,348 --> 00:10:28,475
Oh... father, I am honored.

108
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:31,144
Take the security in the Anvil in
the outer sector.

109
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:34,022
I will send additional units to
patrol for anti-corporates insurgents.

110
00:10:34,522 --> 00:10:36,941
Not even minor inference
will be tolerated.

111
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:40,068
With respect...

112
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:42,529
I should have given the
speech tonight.

113
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:45,573
A chance to pass the torch,
from father to son.

114
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:48,242
When I think you're ready.

115
00:10:48,784 --> 00:10:52,662
- I have been ready for years!
- Which is obvious to maintain security...

116
00:10:53,495 --> 00:10:55,415
Do not disappoint me.

117
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:29,610
I remember those moves.

118
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,362
You should. You were my best student.

119
00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:34,447
I was your only student, Mom!

120
00:11:34,447 --> 00:11:37,325
You hungry?
I have been mashing protein squares.

121
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:40,285
- How about an orange?
- Very funny!

122
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,125
Coffee?

123
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,044
You always talk about missing
it so much.

124
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:51,837
These must have cost a fortune!

125
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,505
I can afford it. Runs have been good.

126
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,382
Jin, running anti Tekken contraband
will get you killed.

127
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,676
I could always enter "Iron Fist"...

128
00:11:59,175 --> 00:12:00,511
... make some real money.

129
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,096
You will have nothing to do
with Tekken! Do you understand?

130
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:05,640
I will not have you waste your talent.

131
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,392
Well, it wouldn't be a waste. It pays.

132
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:10,686
And what difference does it make?

133
00:12:11,478 --> 00:12:12,771
Who cares where the money comes from?

134
00:12:12,771 --> 00:12:14,231
I care.

135
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:16,274
This is not what I trained you for.

136
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:18,109
And what the hell did you
train me for?

137
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:20,632
Do you think that life
on the other side of that wall

138
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:22,696
will bring you happiness?

139
00:12:24,156 --> 00:12:26,324
- Trust me! it won't.
- Oh... here we go.

140
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:29,744
The world burnt because people
had to have more.

141
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:31,412
And this is better?

142
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:33,747
Rationing protein squares?

143
00:12:34,496 --> 00:12:36,041
Is that what my father would
have wanted for us?

144
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,625
Don't!

145
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:38,751
Why won't you ever talk about him?

146
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:41,879
Your father is dead.
That's all you need to know.

147
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,089
You know what! Forget it.
I am out of here!

148
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:46,341
There's a curfew tonight.
There are Jacks everywhere!

149
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:47,800
The Jacks are always everywhere!

150
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,344
I am telling you not to go!

151
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,354
Jin?

152
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:04,022
Hey, Kara!

153
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:06,358
Come here!

154
00:13:08,818 --> 00:13:10,778
- Where have you been?
- Been around...

155
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,991
- What is it?
- Chocolate.

156
00:13:18,117 --> 00:13:19,785
Are you serious?

157
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:26,291
Sounds like I have been replaced.

158
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,626
- We cut it in yet?
- Another minute.

159
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:30,419
We're dropping it on the
west firewall.

160
00:13:31,003 --> 00:13:34,590
We will be inside the Tekken video
sub grip for 60 seconds.

161
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,759
We will interrupt this program
to bring you the truth.

162
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:40,928
No one understands how
you're not dead.

163
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:42,346
Guess I am lucky.

164
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:46,433
About to get lucky.

165
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:08,785
I miss you.

166
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:16,583
Wasn't easy back tracing your hack.

167
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:20,461
It was smart to use none
of Tekken's hardware.

168
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:24,923
Now... almost none.

169
00:14:33,681 --> 00:14:36,433
Now this, is an American classic.

170
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:45,482
Your revolution will not be televised.

171
00:14:55,615 --> 00:14:57,200
Oh shit!

172
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:00,535
Jacks!

173
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:05,582
We got to separate. You will be fine.

174
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:35,774
Sir, we have located the insurgent
in Sector 9.

175
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:38,652
Burn everything! And everyone.

176
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:42,739
- But sir, our men are still in there.
- I don't care! Destroy it!

177
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:09,978
<i>You will have nothing to do with
Tekken. Do you understand?</i>

178
00:17:15,982 --> 00:17:18,861
<i>I will not have you waste your talent.</i>

179
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:40,629
Tekken?

180
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:48,177
Jin...

181
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:54,265
I should have been him!
She asked me not to go!

182
00:17:54,265 --> 00:17:55,975
It's not your fault.

183
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:59,061
- Heihachi Mishima killed her!
- I know how you feel.

184
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,605
My father was killed in a
Jack Hammer raid.

185
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:03,982
And what did anyone do about it?
Nothing!

186
00:18:04,731 --> 00:18:06,442
What does anyone ever do about it?

187
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:08,569
Nothing!

188
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:10,821
He's going to pay for what he has done.

189
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:32,631
<i>Contestants for open call,
please proceed to Tekken east gate.</i>

190
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,800
Ok! Ladies and gentlemen! Listen up!

191
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:39,011
So who's going to be the next
People's choice?

192
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:41,555
And the next Iron Fist champion, huh?

193
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:43,557
Hey! We will never win this shit anyway.

194
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:46,309
Ain't nothing but a goddamn meat
grinder to pump up the crowd.

195
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:47,143
Take off!

196
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,397
A real north wind is coming.

197
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:55,483
So my guess is you going to need oil
to keep those kitties from freezing.

198
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:58,319
I got $100 global dollars.

199
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:03,740
$100 global dollars to any man who will
go one round against "Marshall Law."

200
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,033
One round!

201
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:08,703
You're a bunch of wankies,
every last one of you.

202
00:19:10,662 --> 00:19:12,247
Except you, white boy! Inside!

203
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,585
Last call!

204
00:19:18,628 --> 00:19:20,254
Going?

205
00:19:21,963 --> 00:19:23,340
- Going...
- Wait!

206
00:19:27,592 --> 00:19:29,345
I want to sign up.

207
00:19:33,597 --> 00:19:36,017
Ok! Sign here!

208
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:40,479
Leave the bag!

209
00:19:41,605 --> 00:19:44,191
- Knock yourself out!
- Dead man walking!

210
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:53,240
Hey... gentlemen, as you know,
this is a corporate event.

211
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,534
3 minute round.
So, please make it entertaining!

212
00:20:02,498 --> 00:20:03,957
Eh... big guy! You're up first.

213
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:12,131
You scared?

214
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,299
I am fine.

215
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:19,178
I am not.

216
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:21,806
- Hey, where you going?
- To hell with this!

217
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:25,308
Wanker!

218
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:46,743
Eh! He's up next.
Get him in the cage, now!

219
00:20:57,961 --> 00:20:59,712
Hey! Isn't that Jin?

220
00:21:02,423 --> 00:21:04,508
Hey! That one is Jin.

221
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:17,727
I am going to Iron Fist,
and you're in my way!

222
00:21:18,353 --> 00:21:20,688
You will learn some respect.

223
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:28,653
<i>This kid doesn't have what it takes
to stand up to Marshal Law.</i>

224
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:29,863
He's going to be roadkill!

225
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,583
<i>- Break free!
- I can't!</i>

226
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,085
<i>If you could still breathe,
you could still fight.</i>

227
00:23:26,376 --> 00:23:28,045
<i>You're only beaten when you decide!</i>

228
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:29,880
<i>Again!</i>

229
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:59,655
<i>... has just become
the Peoples choice.</i>

230
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,824
Respect!

231
00:24:03,365 --> 00:24:04,450
Do you hear it?

232
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,304
I have never seen Marshall Law
beaten by an amateur.

233
00:24:29,304 --> 00:24:31,306
Ratings are up.

234
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:33,767
Our viewers love him.

235
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,601
He represents the street.

236
00:24:36,686 --> 00:24:38,771
Let's see what the street is talking.

237
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,399
Hey... come on!
Give us some space. Move!

238
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:45,276
Come on! Out of the way, come on.
Give us some space.

239
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:47,080
- What's your name?
- Jin.

240
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,530
Jin! You know what you just did, Jin?

241
00:24:50,093 --> 00:24:52,449
You just beat a Tekken fighter.

242
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:56,160
Hey! You say you're from
the Anvil, huh.

243
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,286
Right...

244
00:24:57,286 --> 00:24:58,662
So... who taught you to fight?

245
00:24:58,662 --> 00:25:00,122
My mother.

246
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:02,124
Huh! Your mother? No way!

247
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:03,917
She's dead.

248
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:08,504
Eh! You just won the only
open slot in "Iron Fist."

249
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:12,506
Every other fighter in this tournament
has sponsors, everyone except you.

250
00:25:12,506 --> 00:25:13,175
Say, who's taking care of

251
00:25:13,175 --> 00:25:16,969
registration, paper work, training...
all the silly little details.

252
00:25:19,304 --> 00:25:20,889
I can take care of that for you.

253
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:24,934
- What's in it for you?
- I don't know... 30%.

254
00:25:25,351 --> 00:25:27,270
What? You take 10.

255
00:25:28,103 --> 00:25:30,314
I like your attitude, but no!

256
00:25:30,856 --> 00:25:32,774
20% and we're done.

257
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:34,984
Fine!

258
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,321
Smart choice! Let's go!

259
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,240
Eh! You don't have anything
to pack, do you?

260
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,076
I don't think so. Come on!

261
00:25:56,793 --> 00:25:58,254
<i>I remember those moves.</i>

262
00:25:58,254 --> 00:26:01,090
<i>You should. You were my best student.</i>

263
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:04,718
<i>You will have nothing to do
with Tekken! Do you understand?</i>

264
00:26:06,052 --> 00:26:09,305
<i>The world burnt because people
had to have more.</i>

265
00:26:09,305 --> 00:26:12,224
<i>Tekken was built on people
wanting more.</i>

266
00:26:31,574 --> 00:26:34,034
What is the old man waiting for?

267
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,955
I am his son... his heir.

268
00:26:42,957 --> 00:26:46,252
Tekken should be mine now.

269
00:26:58,221 --> 00:27:01,098
- Kazuya!
- Father ...

270
00:27:03,224 --> 00:27:04,768
I see that.

271
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:11,357
Explain yourself!

272
00:27:12,983 --> 00:27:18,947
We wiped out a pocket of insurgents.
I took a moment to unwind.

273
00:27:19,696 --> 00:27:21,407
You should be making preparations
for Iron Fist.

274
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,367
Everythings been taken cared of.

275
00:27:25,285 --> 00:27:29,038
After all this time,
you still don't understand.

276
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:34,585
Winning Iron Fist

277
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:36,586
means power and prestige for Tekken!

278
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:39,714
And honor for the Mishima name!

279
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:42,633
Winning here means we win
in the world.

280
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,719
So you said!

281
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:21,624
Eh! You stay close to me, ok!
Keep your mouth shut.

282
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:25,252
Eh! You got to stop checking the Jacks.

283
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:27,295
-Why?
-It's not the Anvil!

284
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:31,674
This is civilization, my friend!

285
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,926
Land of opportunity!

286
00:28:34,551 --> 00:28:36,261
Let's go!

287
00:28:40,598 --> 00:28:42,516

Capoeira master. Underworld enforcer.

292
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:57,487
There's a price on his head
from a neo Salvadorian group.

293
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,407
He's powerful
but he is easily frustrated.

294
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:05,452
Sergei Dragunov, Sambo fighter.

295
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,371

Russian military.

00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,832

00:29:28,221 --> 00:29:31,141

Skilled mixed martial arts trained

304
00:29:34,392 --> 00:29:37,312
Also easy on the eyes.

305
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,399
Miguel Rojo, Zipota Specialist.

306
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,359
He's all style strategy

307
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,444
but he's a crowd pleaser.

308
00:29:46,944 --> 00:29:50,156

00:29:50,949 --> 00:29:53,493

00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:07,588
and our current Iron Fist champion.

312
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:23,476
What is this? Are you kidding me?

313
00:30:24,184 --> 00:30:26,353
It's signature.

314
00:30:28,022 --> 00:30:29,856
I am not wearing those.

315
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:36,862
See, things are different now Jin.
This is "Iron Fist."

316
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:39,656
Iron Fist, image is key.

317
00:30:40,364 --> 00:30:42,033
You have your signature move.

318
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:44,744
And guess what, now you
have your signature look.

319
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,581
Steve Fox.

320
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,584
Who is this guy?

321
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,961
Never seen him before.

322
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:58,130
Who raps?

323
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,882
Just another amateur.

324
00:31:00,882 --> 00:31:03,051
He's nothing.

325
00:31:03,051 --> 00:31:05,553
So they must love you.
They gave you Marshall Law's digs.

326
00:31:06,428 --> 00:31:09,014
Stick around. I will be right back.

327
00:31:25,778 --> 00:31:27,905
What's your problem?

328
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:29,782
Nothing...

329
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:33,368
You know it's rude to stare.

330
00:31:34,618 --> 00:31:37,413
Sorry. I was just admiring your toes.

331
00:31:39,081 --> 00:31:41,333
Excuse me?

332
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:46,129
I mean Baguazhang requires very
precise foot placement the way you

333
00:31:46,129 --> 00:31:48,756
spread your toes, it's uhmm...

334
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:52,092
it's impressive.

335
00:31:53,468 --> 00:31:56,888
- You studied Bagua?
- A little.

336
00:31:58,847 --> 00:32:02,017
- Who are you anyway?
- The name's Jin.

337
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:06,020
So you're the Peoples choice?

338
00:32:06,979 --> 00:32:08,856
You seem surprised.

339
00:32:10,314 --> 00:32:11,775
You don't look like much!

340
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:14,527
You will remember you said that,
when I win Iron Fist.

341
00:32:16,528 --> 00:32:17,738
Right...

342
00:32:20,198 --> 00:32:22,743
Eh... Jin, this way!

343
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,704
See you in the arena!

344
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:36,629
<i>Coming to you live from this year
Iron Fist tournament in Tekken City.</i>

345
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,715
<i>That's right. History was made</i>

346
00:32:39,715 --> 00:32:44,928
<i>when for the first time a wild card
open call play was won by an unknown.</i>

347
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:47,055
<i>His name is Jin.</i>

348
00:32:47,055 --> 00:32:49,890
<i>This young fighter won with
spectacular style</i>

349
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,226
<i>and will appear next to the world
greatest fighters.</i>

350
00:32:53,225 --> 00:32:53,976
<i>Raven!</i>

351
00:32:56,813 --> 00:32:59,774
<i>Miguel Rojo!</i>

352
00:33:00,857 --> 00:33:03,360
<i>Nina Williams!</i>

353
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:06,654
<i>Anna Williams!</i>

354
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:10,908
<i>Sergei Dragunov!</i>

355
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:13,952
<i>Bryan Fury!</i>

356
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:18,706
<i>Eddy Gordo! Valencorp!</i>

357
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,167
Staring at my ass is a good
way to get yours kicked,

358
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,878
I'd keep my head in the game
if I were you.

359
00:33:27,462 --> 00:33:30,758
<i>Christie Monteiro! Vectracorp!</i>

360
00:33:31,633 --> 00:33:34,428
Eh... Jin! You feel ok?

361
00:33:36,721 --> 00:33:38,556
I felt sick!

362
00:33:38,806 --> 00:33:40,516
- You think you're going to puke?
- I already did that.

363
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:45,896
<i>The first Anvil fighter ever
to win an open call,</i>

364
00:33:45,896 --> 00:33:48,564
<i>... Jin, the People's choice!</i>

365
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:54,903
He's quite impressive yesterday.

366
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:56,696
Yeah, but not on the same level as
the other fighters.

367
00:33:57,613 --> 00:33:59,157
Maybe you should ask Marshall Law.

368
00:33:59,948 --> 00:34:02,451
He caught Law at a weak moment.

369
00:34:02,451 --> 00:34:03,952
Why are you so threatened
by this fighter?

370
00:34:03,952 --> 00:34:05,328
I am not.

371
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,499
I just hate to see Tekken embarrassed
by a lucky amateur.

372
00:34:30,724 --> 00:34:34,811
<i>Raven Vs. Eddy Gordo!</i>

373
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:38,106
<i>In the first round of the
"Iron Fist" tournament.</i>

374
00:35:32,693 --> 00:35:35,029
-Bring it on, boy.
-Come on!

375
00:36:13,644 --> 00:36:15,938
<i>Raven is the winner!</i>

376
00:36:15,938 --> 00:36:18,648
<i>Advancing to the next round!</i>

377
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:36,830
<i>Miguel Rojo!</i>

378
00:36:45,253 --> 00:36:49,341
<i>Jin, the People's choice!</i>

379
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:52,844
You're up kid!

380
00:36:56,804 --> 00:36:58,807
Good luck!

381
00:37:04,228 --> 00:37:06,564
This guy's a prick. He thinks he's the
second coming!

382
00:37:06,564 --> 00:37:08,565
His ego tilts way too over confident.

383
00:37:08,565 --> 00:37:10,233
- He's damn good!
- Yeah... he is.

384
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:12,569
But use that ego against him,
use the speed against him.

385
00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:15,946
Tired this guy out, ok! Second move.

386
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,157
Let's go! Come on!

387
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:21,493
Come on! You ready? Let's go.

388
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:25,329
Eh! One last thing ok,
you get ready to release your jab

389
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:26,664
when he throws his right...

390
00:37:26,664 --> 00:37:30,333
Everytime he throws his right,
he locked up his left knee, ok!

391
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:33,628
Great, thanks!

392
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,423
Use it!

393
00:38:27,631 --> 00:38:30,384
Like I said, not in their league.

394
00:38:30,926 --> 00:38:32,677
You know where you are?

395
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,513
This is Iron Fist!

396
00:38:36,055 --> 00:38:38,224
Come on!

397
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:40,267
Yes!

398
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:55,155
Yes!

399
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:22,302
Get him!

400
00:39:27,013 --> 00:39:28,933
That's it, kid.

401
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,024
Get up... Jin, shake it up. Get up!

402
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,444
So much for the People's choice ...

403
00:39:42,444 --> 00:39:43,612
Shut up!

404
00:39:43,612 --> 00:39:45,238
What's the matter, Monteiro?

405
00:39:45,822 --> 00:39:47,699
The Anvil rat got under your skin?

406
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:50,201
When we see what's under your skin,
Cyborg!

407
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:53,704
- What did you say?
- You heard me!

408
00:39:56,497 --> 00:39:58,416
<i>Never underestimate your opponent!</i>

409
00:39:59,165 --> 00:40:00,459
<i>Watch! Attack!</i>

410
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:02,669
<i>Every strike should be your best!</i>

411
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,091
That's it Jin! Get up!

412
00:40:55,046 --> 00:40:56,173
Jin!

413
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:03,971
Stop it! Jin! It's over!

414
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:09,225
You were saying?

415
00:41:25,405 --> 00:41:28,033
- Thanks for the tip.
- Well, that's my job!

416
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:31,744
See, the more fights you win,
the more money I make.

417
00:41:31,993 --> 00:41:33,912
- Does that hurt?
- It hurts everywhere!

418
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,915
Nice finish!

419
00:41:36,915 --> 00:41:40,585
Very entertaining but
completely out of control.

420
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:42,461
You know you don't have time
for that shit right, huh!?

421
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:44,797
I know why I am here.

422
00:41:44,797 --> 00:41:46,548
- You do?
- Yeah.

423
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:48,466
Good! Because you were damn
lucky in there.

424
00:41:48,466 --> 00:41:50,343
Next time you got to get
everyone as quick as you can.

425
00:41:50,343 --> 00:41:51,802
You got to hit him hard,
you got to hit him high!

426
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:54,096
Steve Fox.

427
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:56,515
Back from the Anvil.

428
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:59,017
Ohh! We both know
Tekken city is my home.

429
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,768
Of course...

430
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,771
I have heard you advised your expertise
to our new fighter.

431
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:07,566
Let me introduce you.
This is Jin, People's choice.

432
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:11,486
Well, congratulations on a
spectacular fight.

433
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:15,781
You have impressed my father,
not an easy task.

434
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:17,866
I'd like to thank
Mr. Mishima in person...

435
00:42:17,866 --> 00:42:19,117
... for this opportunity.

436
00:42:19,742 --> 00:42:21,911
Well, continue winning, and you will.

437
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:25,289
There's something familiar
about your style.

438
00:42:26,831 --> 00:42:28,625
Did your father ever fight
in Iron Fist?

439
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:31,127
Didn't know my father.

440
00:42:31,127 --> 00:42:32,837
Another common in the Anvil.

441
00:42:33,337 --> 00:42:35,089
Work hard, keep training.

442
00:42:35,798 --> 00:42:37,549
Someday you could be
an asset to Tekken.

443
00:42:37,549 --> 00:42:39,134
I will never belong to Tekken.

444
00:42:40,384 --> 00:42:41,678
We will see about that...

445
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:51,227
What was that?

446
00:42:51,227 --> 00:42:53,062
Just... just do your job!

447
00:43:05,905 --> 00:43:08,784
<i>Defeat is a choice, so is victory.</i>

448
00:43:10,034 --> 00:43:12,078
<i>You're only beaten when you decide.</i>

449
00:43:12,078 --> 00:43:13,704
Again!

450
00:43:53,029 --> 00:43:54,739
I got to get out of here for a while.

451
00:43:55,822 --> 00:43:57,283
Thought that was against the rules.

452
00:43:59,408 --> 00:44:01,786
Not if you don't get caught.

453
00:44:49,827 --> 00:44:52,454
<i>That's Jin, the People's choice...
entering the club.</i>

454
00:44:52,871 --> 00:44:53,838
<i>Let's go! Give it up!</i>

455
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:56,999
- Eh Jin, you were great today!
- Thank you.

456
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,378
Three days ago, I got Gang Bang
trying to kill me.

457
00:45:01,961 --> 00:45:04,756
And today you're a celebrity,
get used to it.

458
00:45:13,971 --> 00:45:15,598
So what happened up there with Rojo?

459
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:18,100
I beat him! That's what happened.

460
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,269
You did more than just beat him.
You almost killed him.

461
00:45:20,269 --> 00:45:22,270
Can I give you a little advise?

462
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:24,981
Iron Fist isn't about killing
or getting yourself killed.

463
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,108
So you brought me here to warn me?

464
00:45:27,108 --> 00:45:29,943
I am just saying... an attitude like
that is going to get you in trouble.

465
00:45:29,943 --> 00:45:31,778
Guess I should be more in-control.

466
00:45:32,194 --> 00:45:34,197
Like you...

467
00:45:35,156 --> 00:45:36,908
You don't know anything about me.

468
00:45:38,242 --> 00:45:40,202
You grew up just outside
the American territories.

469
00:45:40,743 --> 00:45:42,204
Your grandfather taught
you how to fight.

470
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,997
Entered you into amateur leagues.

471
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:46,040
Made you a champion.

472
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,959
I have seen you in the Iron Fist promos.

473
00:45:47,959 --> 00:45:50,294
Well, those promos just showcase
on my skills.

474
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:44,339
Ok! He's gone.

475
00:46:52,304 --> 00:46:55,348
- I shouldn't ...
- I think you should.

476
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:02,813
I need sleep.

477
00:47:03,562 --> 00:47:05,857
I may have to kick your
ass tommorow morning.

478
00:47:05,857 --> 00:47:07,942
You promise?

479
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,700
Go to bed!

480
00:48:00,486 --> 00:48:02,196
Jin!

481
00:48:21,127 --> 00:48:23,464
Stand up for Christ sake!

482
00:48:25,464 --> 00:48:27,342
I knew it!

483
00:48:27,342 --> 00:48:29,802
They're worried because they actually
believe you have a shot.

484
00:48:30,345 --> 00:48:31,387
Nothing changes.

485
00:48:31,387 --> 00:48:33,493
There's no way, no way
they're going to let someone from

486
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,474
the Anvil win the Iron Fist.

487
00:48:37,308 --> 00:48:39,435
Maybe it has to do with
something else.

488
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:44,189
Where did you get this?

489
00:48:44,564 --> 00:48:46,817
Belonged to my mother.

490
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:51,320
Jun Kazama.

491
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:53,364
I knew her!

492
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:55,657
You knew her?

493
00:48:56,073 --> 00:48:57,868
We were in Iron Fist together.

494
00:48:58,617 --> 00:49:00,286
That's not possible!

495
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:03,998
She was a Tekken fighter, Jin.
She was good.

496
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:05,874
You don't know what you're
talking about.

497
00:49:05,874 --> 00:49:09,878
Every single thing about
your mother was unique.

498
00:49:10,669 --> 00:49:12,296
Even her fighting style.

499
00:49:12,296 --> 00:49:14,215
Why didn't she say anything?

500
00:49:15,006 --> 00:49:16,550
Why would she lie to me?

501
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:18,009
Maybe she was trying
to protect you, Jin.

502
00:49:18,009 --> 00:49:19,219
Listen to me, Jin.

503
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:21,888
Right now you need to get out of here,
go underground.

504
00:49:22,262 --> 00:49:23,431
She's right.

505
00:49:23,431 --> 00:49:24,557
I am not leaving!

506
00:49:24,557 --> 00:49:28,226
- Forget Iron Fist.
- I don't give a damn about Iron Fist!

507
00:49:29,601 --> 00:49:32,813
I came here to kill Heihachi Mishima.

508
00:49:41,821 --> 00:49:44,615
Do you know what a nightmare this is?

509
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:46,867
I think you worry too much.

510
00:49:46,867 --> 00:49:48,493
Don't talk back to me!

511
00:49:49,035 --> 00:49:52,080
You failed me! He's still alive!

512
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,541
It was a fluke! It won't happen again.

513
00:49:56,499 --> 00:50:00,795
No! You are underestimating him!

514
00:50:02,005 --> 00:50:05,758
And now, I have to clean up your mess.

515
00:50:17,558 --> 00:50:19,186
Stay where the TV cameras can see you.

516
00:50:20,186 --> 00:50:22,272
They won't try anything if the
world's watching.

517
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,651
<i>Christie Monteiro.</i>

518
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,947
<i>Nina Williams!</i>

519
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,702
I think it was her.

520
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,453
What?

521
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,080
Nina Williams.

522
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,582
She was one of the assasins.

523
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:49,920
Good to know.

524
00:51:13,523 --> 00:51:14,816
I am a little late last night.

525
00:51:16,692 --> 00:51:19,486
I like your boyfriend, he's cute!

526
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,009
Sorry. I don't share.

527
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,891
A $100,000 global dollars to
whoever kills that kid from the Anvil.

528
00:51:56,684 --> 00:51:59,353
What makes you think
I need your money?

529
00:52:05,483 --> 00:52:08,277
Replacing bone with Flex steel
isn't cheap, is it Bryan?

530
00:52:09,194 --> 00:52:10,696
Neither is the maintenance...

531
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:13,114
It's no wonder you could
punch through wall.

532
00:52:13,114 --> 00:52:14,782
I am!

533
00:52:14,782 --> 00:52:16,576
But the corporation's made me.

534
00:52:17,118 --> 00:52:21,079
As I recall, Bio-enhancements
are illegal in Iron Fist.

535
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:24,791
Christ... Bryan, you're half robot.

536
00:52:25,207 --> 00:52:27,376
You will be banned for life.

537
00:52:32,714 --> 00:52:35,175
Log in the fights selector.

538
00:52:38,427 --> 00:52:40,971
- What are the Jacks doing here?
- Extra security.

539
00:52:41,555 --> 00:52:43,765
There was an incident inside
the barracks last night.

540
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:46,059
I read the report.

541
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,311
Insurgent forces inside Tekken.

542
00:52:48,311 --> 00:52:51,313
There is no reason for concern.
I dealt with the problem...

543
00:52:51,687 --> 00:52:53,065
... personally.

544
00:52:53,065 --> 00:52:55,817
I don't want anything to
happen to this young fighter.

545
00:53:00,404 --> 00:53:01,947
Hey! How're you feeling?

546
00:53:02,571 --> 00:53:03,990
I am good...

547
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:08,619
<i>Jin! The People's choice!</i>

548
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:10,079
Let me see!

549
00:53:10,578 --> 00:53:11,580
Shit!

550
00:53:14,332 --> 00:53:16,251
Yoshimitsu!

551
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,670
Eh, I have something for you.

552
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,884
My old power gloves.

553
00:53:27,468 --> 00:53:31,180
Well, it's been a long time.

554
00:53:32,513 --> 00:53:34,516
A little worst for wear now...

555
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:37,769
Give me your hand.

556
00:53:38,269 --> 00:53:39,937
It's going to keep you safe.

557
00:53:42,939 --> 00:53:47,360
When you're out there today,
you stay smart, ok!?

558
00:53:48,403 --> 00:53:50,404
You got to bob, you got to weave,
you got to fly if you have to.

559
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:54,616
But you don't let Yoshimitsu
touch you! Ever.

560
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:58,578
Take him!

561
00:54:10,171 --> 00:54:12,256
Nice!

562
00:54:17,093 --> 00:54:19,512
Re-cycle the challenges selection.

563
00:54:20,096 --> 00:54:21,097
What are you doing?

564
00:54:21,097 --> 00:54:23,724
This match is better suited for
the semi final.

565
00:54:32,897 --> 00:54:33,941
No!

566
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:38,987
You can't do that!
These two have to fight, now!

567
00:54:39,987 --> 00:54:43,699
- Are you questioning me?
- No, I am replacing you!

568
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,370
Jacks!

569
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,289
What are you doing? Stand down!

570
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:56,293
You put me in charge of security,
remember... father?

571
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,212
The Jack Hammers answer to me!

572
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,630
Kazuya, do not do this!

573
00:55:02,214 --> 00:55:03,674
It's done!

574
00:55:03,674 --> 00:55:05,801
I am through waiting.

575
00:55:06,384 --> 00:55:08,470
Tekken is mine!

576
00:55:10,096 --> 00:55:12,223
Maintain the original fight selection.

577
00:55:32,114 --> 00:55:33,240
Jesus!

578
00:56:32,081 --> 00:56:36,210
<i>Yoshimitsu was a past
Iron Fist champion.</i>

579
00:57:34,425 --> 00:57:37,344
Look at the ratings, through the roof!

580
00:57:38,469 --> 00:57:40,597
You see the only thing audience is
craving more than blood...

581
00:57:41,348 --> 00:57:42,765
... is death.

582
00:57:43,474 --> 00:57:46,018
You see father, I have learnt.

583
00:58:03,074 --> 00:58:05,326
<i>Yoshimitsu is out for blood.</i>

584
00:58:05,785 --> 00:58:07,453
<i>He's decimating Jin.</i>

585
00:58:18,086 --> 00:58:19,588
Stop the fight!

586
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:26,927
There is no honor in this!

587
00:58:28,386 --> 00:58:31,181
You are about to witness the
death of Jin Kazama.

588
00:58:31,848 --> 00:58:33,058
Kazama?

589
00:58:33,058 --> 00:58:36,227
Apparently the bi-product of one
of my youthful indiscretions.

590
00:58:37,144 --> 00:58:38,520
You have a son!

591
00:58:40,731 --> 00:58:41,898
I had a son!

592
00:58:49,071 --> 00:58:51,323
<i>Security Alert!</i>

593
00:58:52,157 --> 00:58:53,158
<i>Security Alert!</i>

594
00:58:53,449 --> 00:58:55,326
<i>Destroy the mask of death.</i>

595
00:58:55,326 --> 00:58:58,287
<i>And you will see there is nothing
behind that you fear.</i>

596
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:00,372
<i>Security Alert!</i>

597
00:59:09,864 --> 00:59:10,907
<i>Security Alert!</i>

598
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,966
Damn you old man!

599
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,718
You... will regret this!

600
00:59:16,843 --> 00:59:18,034
Take him!

601
00:59:19,961 --> 00:59:21,004
<i>Security Alert!</i>

602
00:59:21,004 --> 00:59:22,516
Enough of this!

603
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,005
Jin, take this off!

604
00:59:32,858 --> 00:59:34,359
We got to get him out of Tekken city.

605
00:59:39,821 --> 00:59:42,741
<i>Iron Fist fighters are to be detained.</i>

606
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:04,801
Jesus!

607
01:00:05,093 --> 01:00:06,719
They arrested Mishima!

608
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:10,598
We need to get out of here now.
Come on, let's go... this way.

609
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:25,652
You can't arrest us!
We're Iron Fist fighters.

610
01:00:27,654 --> 01:00:29,071
Get in there!

611
01:00:33,784 --> 01:00:36,369
- His shoulder is dislocated.
- Give a hand over here!

612
01:00:36,618 --> 01:00:38,788
- Why the hell are you looking at me?
- You want to help here?

613
01:00:38,788 --> 01:00:40,664
Just do it!

614
01:00:41,707 --> 01:00:43,333
Let's get you up! He's going to... Ok!?

615
01:00:47,837 --> 01:00:49,338
Ok... on...

616
01:00:50,089 --> 01:00:51,736
- Three!
- Thanks!

617
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:57,512
What are you trying to do?

618
01:00:58,805 --> 01:01:01,599
My father always stress the
importance of Iron Fist.

619
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:04,268
Frankly, I never saw the value.

620
01:01:04,934 --> 01:01:07,520
It was a brutal mindless game.

621
01:01:08,562 --> 01:01:10,273
But I finally understand.

622
01:01:11,231 --> 01:01:14,693
In the arena, perception is power.

623
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,613
After the audience thought
Jin killed Yoshimitsu,

624
01:01:19,529 --> 01:01:21,365
the ratings spiked to their
highest level ever.

625
01:01:22,156 --> 01:01:24,034
Which is why I decided...

626
01:01:24,034 --> 01:01:28,663
that the remainder of the tournaments
fights, will be to the death.

627
01:01:30,872 --> 01:01:34,710
I am sure you'd all rather
die fighting in the arena.

628
01:01:35,668 --> 01:01:38,171
Iron Fist continues tomorrow.

629
01:01:41,756 --> 01:01:44,801
I suggest you get some rest!

630
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:55,394
So what now?

631
01:01:56,311 --> 01:01:58,480
We kill or be killed.

632
01:02:00,105 --> 01:02:01,816
We have a choice.

633
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:10,615
If there are no fighters, there is
no tournament and no one has to die.

634
01:02:11,824 --> 01:02:13,993
Alright, line up against the wall!

635
01:02:14,326 --> 01:02:16,203
Hands behind your back!

636
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:18,496
Hands behind your back, I said.

637
01:02:18,912 --> 01:02:20,498
I don't think so!

638
01:02:31,674 --> 01:02:33,217
Come on! Let's move! Now!

639
01:02:38,053 --> 01:02:40,223
This way, come on!

640
01:02:50,147 --> 01:02:51,691
Lock us down!

641
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:10,206
Mishima...

642
01:03:13,918 --> 01:03:16,170
- Mishima...
- You take it easy, Jin!

643
01:03:17,212 --> 01:03:20,632
- Jin Kazama!
- You owe me a life Mishima.

644
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:24,427
I owe you nothing, young man.

645
01:03:24,427 --> 01:03:26,720
How does it feel to be behind bars?

646
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:30,432
We got to move!

647
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:36,353
I am going to need those access codes,
right now!

648
01:03:36,353 --> 01:03:38,939
Get me out of here, I can help!

649
01:03:42,066 --> 01:03:43,609
Key!

650
01:03:53,367 --> 01:03:55,036
This way, old man!

651
01:04:01,123 --> 01:04:02,542
Heihachi Mishima is with them.

652
01:04:03,334 --> 01:04:05,419
They're heading towards the
workers access gate.

653
01:04:06,629 --> 01:04:10,715
Anvil: Green Zone - Tau sector

654
01:04:15,593 --> 01:04:16,971
Move it! Come on!

655
01:04:17,888 --> 01:04:19,765
- Take it easy, you ok?
- Are you ok?

656
01:04:19,765 --> 01:04:21,328
Yes, I am alive.

657
01:04:21,598 --> 01:04:23,017
Kazuya will be sending the
Jack Hammers.

658
01:04:23,017 --> 01:04:25,102
I know a safe house. It's not far.

659
01:04:25,102 --> 01:04:26,896
So maybe I am crazy. Can we go?!

660
01:04:27,271 --> 01:04:29,147
Come on!

661
01:04:39,948 --> 01:04:41,574
Tear the Anvil apart!

662
01:04:43,076 --> 01:04:46,745
I want the fighters found,
and recaptured.

663
01:04:47,621 --> 01:04:48,403
Go!

664
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:20,533
Rest!

665
01:05:33,076 --> 01:05:35,203
A moment!

666
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:44,294
I knew your mother, Jun Kazama.

667
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:47,922
Formidable fighter.
One of Tekken's best.

668
01:05:47,922 --> 01:05:49,965
My mother tried to keep
me away from Tekken.

669
01:05:51,465 --> 01:05:52,676
Now I know why.

670
01:05:53,092 --> 01:05:55,970
Do not judge all of Tekken
by Kazuya's mistakes.

671
01:05:56,387 --> 01:05:59,640
Mistakes? Tekken destroys lives!

672
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:02,392
I created Tekken,
not only as a corporation

673
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:04,894
that is immune to stand the chaos.

674
01:06:05,686 --> 01:06:08,481
We are remaking the world,
raising it from the ashes.

675
01:06:08,481 --> 01:06:11,942
You tell that to the people die,
everyday, in the Anvil.

676
01:06:11,942 --> 01:06:14,486
We brought humanity back from
the brink. We restored order.

677
01:06:14,486 --> 01:06:16,487
- Tekken is peace.
- Tekken is fear!

678
01:06:17,195 --> 01:06:19,907
My mother's blood is
on your hands Mishima!

679
01:06:20,491 --> 01:06:22,784
I saved your mother's life.

680
01:06:25,452 --> 01:06:27,580
What the hell are you talking about?

681
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:31,625
Many years ago after the tournament,
I found her beaten, violated.

682
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:34,586
I am the one that had to take
her from Tekken city.

683
01:06:35,628 --> 01:06:39,173
It was always the sadistic part of him
that I could never control.

684
01:06:39,173 --> 01:06:40,549
Who?

685
01:06:43,217 --> 01:06:45,637
Kazuya... my son.

686
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,015
Your father.

687
01:06:50,724 --> 01:06:52,559
You're lying!

688
01:06:55,227 --> 01:06:59,148
Until today, there was only one
heir to the Tekken throne.

689
01:07:00,566 --> 01:07:02,192
Now, there are two.

690
01:07:07,571 --> 01:07:09,281
Jacks!

691
01:07:26,462 --> 01:07:28,006
Get down, Jin!

692
01:08:01,575 --> 01:08:03,785
Run! Run!

693
01:08:37,896 --> 01:08:39,274
What?

694
01:08:39,981 --> 01:08:41,651
You thought I'd do nothing?

695
01:08:42,525 --> 01:08:44,153
Tekken belongs to me!

696
01:08:45,653 --> 01:08:48,031
You never understood the
spirit of Tekken.

697
01:08:49,699 --> 01:08:52,034
That's why I could not place
Tekken in your hands.

698
01:08:52,263 --> 01:08:54,828
Tekken is in my hands, old man!

699
01:08:55,494 --> 01:08:56,830
Don't you see?

700
01:08:57,330 --> 01:08:59,707
It's over for you now!

701
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:02,585
It's not about me or you.

702
01:09:03,793 --> 01:09:06,088
It's about the Mishima name.

703
01:09:06,358 --> 01:09:09,215
A name that you have not lived up to.

704
01:09:09,215 --> 01:09:13,302
And that's why in the end,
you will fail.

705
01:09:14,344 --> 01:09:16,138
Take Heihachi Mishima away.

706
01:09:18,097 --> 01:09:20,058
Destroy everything...

707
01:09:21,057 --> 01:09:22,393
... including him!

708
01:09:57,088 --> 01:09:59,716
I am Mishima Heihachi.

709
01:10:00,674 --> 01:10:03,511
I am Tekken.

710
01:10:10,057 --> 01:10:12,435
Heihachi Mishima is dead.

711
01:10:33,034 --> 01:10:35,371
<i>Citizens of Tekken and the world.</i>

712
01:10:36,538 --> 01:10:39,457
<i>Today, Iron Fist will make history</i>

713
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:41,918
<i>and you will be histories witness!</i>

714
01:10:42,876 --> 01:10:47,172
<i>The remaining fighters will no longer
fight for the simple glory of victory.</i>

715
01:10:47,172 --> 01:10:53,636
<i>Now, they will fight, as we all must
fight. Everyday we draw breath.</i>

716
01:10:54,637 --> 01:10:56,388
<i>They will fight for their lives!</i>

717
01:10:56,889 --> 01:10:58,932
<i>They will fight to the death.</i>

718
01:11:05,895 --> 01:11:09,232
<i>Sergei Dragunov and Bryan Fury!</i>

719
01:11:09,232 --> 01:11:13,361
<i>In the first round of the
Iron Fist semi-final.</i>

720
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:04,496
What? No hug for your old man?

721
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,376
I remember your mother.

722
01:13:11,814 --> 01:13:13,503
She put up quite a fight.

723
01:13:14,004 --> 01:13:18,007
Frankly, if I knew that whore
was pregnant,

724
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:20,217
I would kill her right then and there.

725
01:13:21,635 --> 01:13:23,261
You want to kill me, don't you?

726
01:13:24,136 --> 01:13:26,431
I... understand that.

727
01:13:31,143 --> 01:13:34,145
But in order to get to me,
you will have to kill the champion...

728
01:13:34,561 --> 01:13:35,939
Bryan Fury.

729
01:13:36,189 --> 01:13:37,982
That's how Iron Fist works.

730
01:13:44,571 --> 01:13:45,822
Get off of me!

731
01:13:45,822 --> 01:13:48,324
Imagine what I will do to her
if you don't fight.

732
01:13:54,829 --> 01:13:56,372
You will fight!

733
01:13:56,372 --> 01:13:57,790
The world will watch!

734
01:13:57,790 --> 01:14:00,459
And my legacy will be written
with your blood.

735
01:14:03,462 --> 01:14:05,005
Take her!

736
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:32,444
When the time comes,
I pray you die screaming!

737
01:14:37,322 --> 01:14:39,075
Behave yourself!

738
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:52,253
Jin, I saw what you did to Rojo.

739
01:14:52,919 --> 01:14:55,255
You let your anger take
control of you.

740
01:14:55,671 --> 01:14:59,175
Anger doesn't fuel the fighter's soul,
it incinerate.

741
01:15:00,008 --> 01:15:01,927
But before that I saw something.

742
01:15:02,803 --> 01:15:04,346
I saw greatness in you.

743
01:15:05,931 --> 01:15:08,558
You're not just fighting
for yourself anymore, Jin...

744
01:15:08,558 --> 01:15:10,393
you're fighting for all of us.

745
01:15:11,102 --> 01:15:12,728
You can become champion.

746
01:15:13,811 --> 01:15:15,605
There are a lot of people
depending on it.

747
01:15:40,917 --> 01:15:42,920
<i>- So... who taught you to fight?
- My mother.</i>

748
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,505
<i>Attack!</i>

749
01:15:46,339 --> 01:15:47,340
<i>Your mother?</i>

750
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:48,466
<i>She's dead.</i>

751
01:15:49,467 --> 01:15:51,344
<i>Do you think that life
on the other side</i>

752
01:15:51,344 --> 01:15:53,220
<i>of that wall will bring you happiness?</i>

753
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,889
<i>Trust me, it won't.</i>

754
01:15:56,389 --> 01:15:58,600
<i>I told you man, this asshole is
a waste of time!</i>

755
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,435
<i>He's just another punk
who'd rather die in the Anvil</i>

756
01:16:01,435 --> 01:16:02,937
<i>than stand up like a man.</i>

757
01:16:05,022 --> 01:16:08,066
<i>But you are Jin is a believer in the
cause, you just don't know it.</i>

758
01:16:10,443 --> 01:16:12,361
<i>So... you're the People's choice?</i>

759
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:15,072
<i>You don't look like much.</i>

760
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,033
<i>My father was killed in the
Jack Hammer raid.</i>

761
01:16:18,033 --> 01:16:20,410
<i>And what did anyone do about it?
Nothing!</i>

762
01:16:21,953 --> 01:16:24,580
<i>One day you will have a
chance to make a difference.</i>

763
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:26,707
<i>That's why I trained you so hard.</i>

764
01:16:30,043 --> 01:16:34,004
<i>Because one day, you will not just be
fighting for you and me.</i>

765
01:16:35,381 --> 01:16:37,674
<i>You will be fighting for all of us.</i>

766
01:16:40,217 --> 01:16:42,136
<i>I love you, Jin!</i>

767
01:16:47,057 --> 01:16:53,771
<i>Bryan Fury Vs Jin,
the People's choice!</i>

768
01:16:58,275 --> 01:17:00,318
<i>It all comes down to this moment.</i>

769
01:17:00,318 --> 01:17:02,070
<i>Two fighters remained.</i>

770
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:04,738
<i>Bryan Fury and Jin,
the People's choice.</i>

771
01:17:19,042 --> 01:17:21,294
Ain't nothing going to save you now, boy!

772
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:34,138
<i>It's been a hell of a
run for this young fighter.</i>

773
01:17:34,138 --> 01:17:36,515
<i>But, can he last against Bryan Fury?</i>

774
01:19:12,344 --> 01:19:14,389
<i>Every opponent has it's weakness.</i>

775
01:19:16,098 --> 01:19:18,392
<i>See it... exploit it!</i>

776
01:19:19,143 --> 01:19:20,185
<i>Strike!</i>

777
01:19:34,029 --> 01:19:37,171
Jin, come on... Jin! Jin... Jin!

778
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:14,522
Yes!

779
01:20:17,525 --> 01:20:20,110
<i>Did you see that?
This kid is full of surprises!</i>

780
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:44,631
Enough! Introduce me, the Final Match!

781
01:20:46,006 --> 01:20:46,788
No!

782
01:20:49,384 --> 01:20:50,427
Jin won!

783
01:20:50,427 --> 01:20:52,262
He's the champion, you can't kill him!

784
01:20:52,763 --> 01:20:54,514
Watch me!

785
01:21:06,148 --> 01:21:11,820
<i>Now entering the arena, fighting for
the honor of the Tekken Corporation.</i>

786
01:21:12,278 --> 01:21:16,282
<i>Kazuya Mishima!</i>

787
01:21:20,577 --> 01:21:22,830
I should thank you.

788
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:26,166
Your coming here give me the
opportunity to take control of Tekken.

789
01:21:43,429 --> 01:21:45,140
Your mother taught you any styles?

790
01:21:45,891 --> 01:21:47,183
All quite strong.

791
01:22:02,403 --> 01:22:03,739
Yes!

792
01:22:03,739 --> 01:22:05,324
There it is!

793
01:22:06,323 --> 01:22:07,826
The lust for vengeance!

794
01:22:08,617 --> 01:22:10,119
The hunger to kill!

795
01:22:10,827 --> 01:22:13,622
Like fire,
coursing through your veins.

796
01:22:14,331 --> 01:22:15,791
You can't deny it, Jin!

797
01:22:16,416 --> 01:22:18,293
It's what makes you who you are!

798
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:20,545
The curse of the Mishima blood.

799
01:22:21,211 --> 01:22:23,589
Like father, like son!

800
01:23:41,654 --> 01:23:43,698
It's your curse, not mine!

801
01:23:57,875 --> 01:23:59,044
You won!

802
01:24:03,965 --> 01:24:08,927
Citizens of Tekken and the world.
I give you, Jin Kazama!

803
01:24:10,427 --> 01:24:14,724
The winner of Iron Fist,
the People's choice!

804
01:24:16,016 --> 01:24:17,935
Now the People's champion!

805
01:24:30,527 --> 01:24:32,405
I never thought I'd live
to see this day.

806
01:24:32,405 --> 01:24:35,282
<i>You have got to say that that
was the greatest champion ever.</i>

807
01:24:35,282 --> 01:24:37,910
Drinks on the house, it's on me!

808
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,167
Where you going to go?

809
01:24:48,335 --> 01:24:50,295
It's time to go home.

810
01:26:16,783 --> 01:26:19,036
<i>On that day,
the house of Mishima fell.</i>

811
01:26:19,952 --> 01:26:22,247
<i>Tyranny had been
challenge and defeated.</i>

812
01:26:23,665 --> 01:26:28,586
<i>And the name Kazama became synonymous
with hope, strength and freedom.</i>

813
01:26:31,170 --> 01:26:32,797
<i>But freedom comes and goes.</i>

814
01:26:32,797 --> 01:26:35,800
<i>And the world had no idea
or warning that the</i>

815
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,677
<i>true legacy of Tekken's
only just beginning.</i>
