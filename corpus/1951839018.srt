1
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,156
Come on!

2
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,297
What?

3
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,611
What? Are you kidding?

4
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,941
Nice shot!

5
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,004
Oh, are you freaking blind?

6
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,422
What the hell, man. I was open.

7
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,120
Bullshit. You were both covered.

8
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,991
Thought I got the shot off on time.

9
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:12,489
Yeah, right.

10
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:19,863
Hey!

11
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,507
Come on. There's two seconds
left on the clock.

12
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,942
Scoreboard's broken.
We got the official time on the ice.

13
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,502
Game's over.

14
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,647
Prick.

15
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,182
Hi.

16
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,719
Hey, Jenny.

17
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,416
I was starting to get worried

18
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,425
you were never going
to come outside.

19
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,085
So was l.

20
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,651
I almost didn't.

21
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,324
Are you all right?

22
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,630
Yeah. Aside from the sudden desire
to slit my wrists,

23
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,466
I think I'll make it to Monday.

24
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,800
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,363
Mm, it's all right.

26
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,068
I'll be fine.

27
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,200
Hey.

28
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,980
Do you want a ride?

29
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,042
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,144
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

31
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,246
Okay.

32
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,078
What are you thinking about?

33
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,224
I'm just freakin' blowing it.

34
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,388
The last second.

35
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,556
Ian.

36
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,293
It's a game.
I know, it's a game.

37
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,302
But--

38
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,396
It's pointless. It's over with.

39
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,405
Come on. Talk about it.

40
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,707
You know how it is.

41
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,645
You ever have a day
where just everyth--

42
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,206
everything's going wrong?

43
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,718
Yeah, sometimes.

44
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,448
That's today.
That's this day.

45
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,955
What happened?

46
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,983
Well, you saw the scoreboard
stop, right?

47
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,494
Yeah. Everyone saw that.

48
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,826
That's what I'm saying.
That doesn't happen.

49
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,890
Uh, that's--
Today has just been--

50
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:06,837
Something's just been off.
It's not right all day.

51
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:07,895
Baby.

52
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,742
Baby, you sound a bit crazy.

53
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,370
I know. It's because I am crazy.

54
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,940
You know, I bet I can make you
forget all about it.

55
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,191
I'd better go.

56
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,390
Call me later, okay?

57
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,195
Hey, I'm crazy about you.

58
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,792
I've heard.

59
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,266
Good night.

60
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,501
Good night.

61
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,109
Bye.

62
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,592
Hey!

63
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,301
Ah, come on.

64
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:41,211
No!

65
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,309
Hello.

66
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,011
Hello.

67
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,060
Ian.

68
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,224
You manage to look

69
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,961
at those spreadsheets
that I sent down?

70
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,970
Spreadsheets.

71
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,341
Yeah.

72
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,380
I was actually just getting to those...

73
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,971
next.

74
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,175
Marcus wants the client bios

75
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,014
for the presentation by 6:00.

76
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,986
Thanks much.

77
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,594
Hey.

78
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,262
You okay?

79
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,769
Yeah. I'm s-- I'm sorry.

80
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:11,969
I'm just spacing. Hi.

81
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,477
Hi.

82
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,446
Back on the pipe again, huh?

83
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,880
No. No. I actually quit yesterday.

84
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,110
Good for you.

85
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,482
Baby steps.

86
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,043
Ready for some bad news?

87
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,684
Uh-uh.

88
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,918
Purchasing want reports
on each of these.

89
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,824
Sorry.

90
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:30,761
Yeah.

91
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,058
Do me a favor.

92
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,359
Anything.

93
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,627
Kill me now.

94
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,295
But then I wouldn't get
to pass this shit off on you

95
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,362
and generally make
your existence a living hell.

96
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,736
So that's
all I'm good for.

97
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,707
Well, I guess I'd miss

98
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,801
seeing your pretty
little face every day.

99
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,380
So you're still heading home
to your folks for the weekend?

100
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,472
Yep.

101
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,511
Well, you don't sound
so enthused.

102
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,920
Well, I could do without
my mum's yearly

103
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,016
"Why aren't you married with three kids
like your sisters?" lecture.

104
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,623
- Do me a favor.
- Anything.

105
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,756
Shoot me if I turn into my sisters.

106
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,960
Yeah, but, see, then I wouldn't get
to see your pretty little face.

107
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,352
Hey, have a good one, Carl.

108
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,960
Just try and keep yourself calm.

109
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,200
- He was just going crazy.
- Call in, then.

110
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,675
- Yeah, yeah, loosen his collar.
- Try and stay as still as you can.

111
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:02,111
All right. Stay with us. Try and breathe.

112
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,773
Does anyone know who he is?

113
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,783
He's getting worse.

114
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,479
Looks like he's having
a heart attack or something.

115
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,983
It's just me.

116
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,181
Sorry, Medea.

117
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,089
- Mmm, so tired.
- Yeah.

118
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,128
Mmm. I just came straight home
and went to sleep.

119
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,322
You okay?

120
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,424
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

121
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,935
Did you remember my dry cleaning?

122
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,238
- Shit!
- Ian, I reminded you twice.

123
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,400
I know. I'm sorry.

124
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,239
- I'm sorry.
- Idiot.

125
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,177
And I bought you a present.

126
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,875
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.

127
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,884
You don't deserve it.

128
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,684
Do you want it now?

129
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,315
Or later?

130
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,762
Let's go with later.

131
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,663
Later's good.

132
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:29,547
All right, then, you have
to promise me that you'll like it.

133
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,489
I cross my heart,
and I hope to die.

134
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,187
- Stick a needle in your eye.
- In my eye.

135
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,320
This thing is heavy.
How much did you spend on this?

136
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,797
- Only my life savings.
- Oh, good.

137
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,663
- Open it!
- Okay.

138
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,066
That's beautiful, babe.

139
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,303
You're always running late.
I thought you might like it.

140
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,040
I do. I love it. It's great.

141
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,947
It's got a timer on it and everything.

142
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,578
There are loads of other functions.

143
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,518
The woman in the shop said that.

144
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,523
What's wrong?

145
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,488
Nothing's wrong. It's fine. I like it.

146
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,327
What's wrong?

147
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,569
I...

148
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,036
I watched a man die today.

149
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,308
What?

150
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,882
On the way home from work,
right in front of me.

151
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,980
And I just shared an elevator
with the guy, you know?

152
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,050
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

153
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,729
And this other guy

154
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,791
was standing over him.

155
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,663
And at first it looked like
he was there to help, I thought.

156
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,606
But then, uh...

157
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,674
What?

158
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,017
I don't know.

159
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,418
I don't know. I guess
I don't know what I saw.

160
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,853
Weird part is,
the guy that was helping him

161
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,259
reminded me of this hockey ref

162
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,297
who used to hassle me.

163
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,492
You never told me
you played hockey.

164
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,968
Of course I did.
Club team in college.

165
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,436
I told you a million times.

166
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,268
No, you definitely didn't.

167
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,508
No, I definitely did.

168
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,569
I'll get my yearbook.

169
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,914
There you go. Number 17.

170
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,992
Yeah.

171
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,963
Number 17's very cute,
but it's not you.

172
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,761
Huh?

173
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,104
That should be me.

174
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,410
All right.
So I never played hockey.

175
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:19,287
Problem is, I'm remembering
something that never happened.

176
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,521
Maybe something's wrong
with me, you know?

177
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,359
I don't know. Do you think
something's wrong with you?

178
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,831
No. I mean, I feel fine.

179
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,530
But you gotta admit, having memories
of shit that never happened...

180
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,664
Come on. Doesn't that
strike you as bizarre?

181
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,539
Nothing bizarre
ever happens to you.

182
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,170
I'm serious, Medea.
You don't think this is a little nuts?

183
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,507
Ian, you're speaking to a girl whose
parents named her after a witch

184
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,644
- who killed her own children.
- That's right.

185
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,621
You'll forgive me if there are
few things that strike me

186
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,682
as being a little nuts.

187
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,594
Something's not right.

188
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,197
Ian, I'm going to bed.

189
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,936
You should come, too.

190
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,396
He knows.

191
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,433
It's too late.

192
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,501
Ian, you're gonna be late.

193
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,584
Son of a bitch!

194
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,557
One day, you might actually
try getting up on time.

195
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,564
And not risk getting fired?

196
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,395
How much fun would that be?

197
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,118
Stop! Stop the bus!
Stop the bus!

198
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,254
Stop the bus, please. Sorry.

199
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,973
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, I need to talk to you.

200
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,737
- I don't have any money. I have none.
- Look-- Please, Ian-- Ian--

201
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,372
Please! If you don't listen
to me, you'll be killed.

202
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,941
Come on. We need to go
somewhere safe. Come on.

203
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,851
Come on.

204
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,016
Come on.

205
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,389
I'm sorry.
Do l-- Do I know you?

206
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,621
Your watch stopped.

207
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,126
Your watch.

208
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:28,496
After you left for work this morning,

209
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,693
it stopped, didn't it?

210
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:33,260
Whenever a clock stops, they're coming.

211
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:34,270
Who?

212
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,500
You know.

213
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,706
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

214
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,541
Listen, you're a smart boy.

215
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,843
Don't let denial
get in the way of that.

216
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,780
- Who the hell are you?
- That's not important.

217
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,786
- No. You know what? That is important.
- They're hunting you, Ian.

218
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:52,813
Since yesterday afternoon at 5:00,
when you woke up and this life started.

219
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,756
- "When this life started." Okay.
- Yes. Yes.

220
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,259
They created it for you.

221
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,796
Yesterday, at 5:03,
you found yourself

222
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,991
a year out of university,
stuck in an office,

223
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:04,092
- trussed up in a jacket and tie you hate.
- Don't touch me!

224
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,536
Before that, you were a hockey player
in a small university.

225
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,040
Wait a minute. Hockey.
That happened?

226
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,269
Yes. And before that,
you were someone else.

227
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,104
No, no... Just listen to me.

228
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,082
If they kill you, this is
gonna happen all over again.

229
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,141
No, it won't. If they kill me,
I'll be dead.

230
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:24,120
You won't die.

231
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,156
They've been murdering you
every day.

232
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:32,458
Always at different times,
different places, different lives.

233
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,261
You never know when they're gonna
get you, but sooner or later, they do.

234
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,698
This is insane.

235
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,134
You have no idea
what you're dealing with here.

236
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,570
They can alter reality, control minds.

237
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,505
You only see what they want you to see.

238
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,440
What the hell are they?

239
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,875
"They"...

240
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,470
People have called them lots of things.
Ghosts, demons...

241
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,448
No, no, no. Don't give me
this voodoo bullshit.

242
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,383
They coexist with humans
but on anther plane,

243
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,852
and they can only be seen
when they want to be seen.

244
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,152
And they're coming after you
because they need to stop you.

245
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,953
- From doing what?
- Remembering.

246
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,425
Okay. Remembering what?

247
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,223
They're gonna keep killing you
until you do what they want.

248
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,457
Okay, but I don't know
what that is!

249
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,097
No! Just--

250
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,499
Just run!

251
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,901
Run!

252
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,408
Who you lookin' at?

253
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,720
Come on!

254
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,092
Shit!

255
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,860
Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop!

256
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,591
Fuck!

257
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,987
Hey!

258
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,651
Hey!

259
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,281
- Ian, what are you doing home?
- They're trying to kill me!

260
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:38,288
- Who? What?
- I don't know. I don't know.

261
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,221
- Ian, calm down. Tell me...
- Shh!

262
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,757
Do you hear that?
Do you hear that?

263
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,614
Ian...

264
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,763
Medea...

265
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,772
what are you doing?

266
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,874
I'm sorry, Ian.

267
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,180
I'm so sorry.

268
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,095
I don't enjoy this, Ian,

269
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,530
but you leave me no choice.

270
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,509
No.

271
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:12,945
No!

272
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:20,816
Ohhh, Ian.

273
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,060
Ian.

274
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,596
You shouldn't have remembered.

275
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,036
It'll be all right.

276
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,169
I promise.

277
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,912
Watch out!

278
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,315
Christ!

279
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,379
Pull over and get some coffee
or something, will you?

280
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,925
I'm really sorry about that.

281
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:58,292
Getting the customer to their destination
alive usually makes for a better tip.

282
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,196
Yeah, I've-- I've heard.

283
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,238
So you were saying that you're heading home
to your folks for the weekend, huh?

284
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,138
- Yeah. Last minute.
- Yeah.

285
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,438
I missed my train.

286
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,535
You don't sound so enthused.

287
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,007
I could do without
my mum's yearly,

288
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,573
"Why aren't you married
with three kids like your sisters?"

289
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:26,380
Well, we'll have you home in a jiffy.

290
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:29,324
I thought my mum was the only one
who still said "jiffy."

291
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:47,967
Thank you.

292
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,775
Thank you.

293
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,780
No, no. Miss? Miss?

294
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,120
I can't-- I can't--

295
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,160
I mean,
I almost got you killed.

296
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:06,288
Well, you got me here alive
and are being tipped accordingly.

297
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,364
Thank you.

298
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,669
Why don't you come in for a sec?

299
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,102
You look like you
could use a coffee.

300
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:21,111
Uh, no.

301
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,147
I probably shouldn't. I mean--

302
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,774
'Cause then I'd interrupt
the party, and your mom

303
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,944
would think you're getting started
on those three kids with a cabdriver.

304
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,614
Probably have a heart attack.

305
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,589
Okay.

306
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:36,889
Well, why don't you wait here
while I go get you one?

307
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:42,356
- That I could do.
- Okay.

308
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,196
Two minutes.

309
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,203
All right.

310
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,906
You okay?

311
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,207
Yeah. I'm just
really late for a call, so--

312
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,447
Don't you want the coffee?

313
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,588
Coffee. Right. Thank you.

314
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,854
Okay.

315
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,760
Hello!

316
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,701
Ian.

317
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,876
I know you.

318
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:49,853
How do I know you?

319
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,049
You have to remember, Ian.
They're already coming.

320
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,960
But whatever you do,
don't let them find her.

321
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,328
If they find out, they could
do terrible things to her,

322
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,995
and that will be the end for you.

323
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,613
What did you just--

324
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,422
What the hell's happening to me?

325
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,962
Come on.

326
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,470
Yep, I promise.
I'll be home this weekend.

327
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,875
Uh, look, listen. Okay.
I've gotta go.

328
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,469
Yeah, I'll be there.

329
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:26,108
I love you, too.
Bye. Bye.

330
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,414
Sorry about that.

331
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,317
Ian,

332
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,248
did you look for work last week?

333
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,891
Yeah. I had three appointments,

334
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,728
and all three positions had been filled
by the time I got there.

335
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,963
And what happened
with Mr. Glenn?

336
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,638
He was an asshole, and I didn't
feel like spending all day

337
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,270
crammed in a truck with him.

338
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,677
Have the clocks stopped?

339
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:57,805
What?

340
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,009
The clocks. H-Have--
Have the clocks stopped?

341
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:01,517
Why would they stop?

342
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,986
Are you all right?

343
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,549
Yeah.

344
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,787
You're gonna think
I'm absolutely crazy,

345
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:17,527
but I keep waking up in different places,

346
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:20,833
and everything's changed,
except you, 'cause you're still here.

347
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,634
Ian,

348
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,335
I thought you said you cleaned up.

349
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,274
What?

350
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:28,471
No. No, no, no.

351
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,104
This has nothing to do with that.

352
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:33,378
You don't understand.
These people are trying to kill me.

353
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,385
Right.

354
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,785
I'm not crazy, all right?

355
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,823
- This is happening to me.
- Yes, okay.

356
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,915
- I understand.
- No, you don't understand.

357
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,392
All right? You don't believe me.

358
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,122
I'm sorry. You need
to calm down, okay?

359
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,426
I don't understand. You have to
explain it to me. I'm sorry.

360
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,768
Oh, my God.

361
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,771
Oh, my God.
It's happening again.

362
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:01,843
What's happening again?

363
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,812
Ian?

364
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,585
Shit!

365
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,694
Come on. Come on!

366
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:43,344
Hey! Excuse me.

367
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,549
- Ian! What the hell's the matter with you?
- Let me go.

368
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:49,855
- I've gotta--
- Ian! Ian! Hey!

369
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,861
Oh, my God. It's you.

370
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,022
- He told me not to let them find you.
- For Christ sake, Ian...

371
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:56,532
Jenny, listen to me!
You're not safe.

372
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,693
- Okay?
- What?

373
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,703
Ian, stop running.

374
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,762
Oh, my God.

375
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,070
Ian!

376
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:06,268
Ian!

377
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,675
Jenny, don't follow me!

378
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,197
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

379
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:30,529
Bloody hell!
What's up with you, mate?

380
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,161
Just go! Go!

381
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,552
So, where to?

382
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,323
Stop! Let me out!

383
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,888
Oi! Oi!

384
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,384
We don't like doing this, Ian,

385
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,851
but we don't have much choice.

386
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,013
Do we?

387
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,918
Ian!

388
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,045
Ian!

389
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:07,420
For fuck's sake, Ian! I can hear
that shit through my floor.

390
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,982
- Turn it down!
- Jenny.

391
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,618
I'm gonna call the landlord next time.

392
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,822
Jenny...

393
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,697
Jesus Christ, Ian.

394
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,180
Please wake up.
Please wake up.

395
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,318
But I feel bad for him, you know?

396
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,823
He wasn't always...

397
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,289
Yeah, you're right.

398
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:52,131
I will call the landlord. I promise.

399
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:57,505
No, don't come over. I'll be fine.

400
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:01,443
Okay. I'll come to yours.

401
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:05,073
Because you've got a bigger TV.

402
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:24,696
Ian! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

403
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,164
Jenny...

404
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,575
Jenny, I need your help.

405
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,979
Look, just get the hell
out of my house.

406
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:39,015
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?
I promise.

407
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,675
I'm warning you,
just stay away from me.

408
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:44,209
Jenny, you know me?

409
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,812
Of course I know you.

410
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,220
From the office.

411
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,282
What office?

412
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,232
Ian, do you need me
to call you an ambulance?

413
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,964
No.

414
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,168
What's wrong with you?

415
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,650
Okay, I'm gonna get some help.

416
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:18,154
Don't touch the door.

417
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,690
We know each other
a lot better than you think.

418
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,453
What do you mean?

419
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,084
You don't like going home
to your mother's

420
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,594
'cause she wishes
you were married with kids,

421
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,597
like your sisters.

422
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,656
Come on.
I need you to remember.

423
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,838
Get up.

424
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:45,979
Duck!

425
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:21,740
Oh, God!

426
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,878
Tell me why

427
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,724
you never learn.

428
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:33,262
Maybe you should stop this now,

429
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,298
because I can do this

430
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,094
forever.

431
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,602
Run!

432
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,010
Ian.

433
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,569
Okay.

434
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:30,218
What are those things?

435
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,653
I'm still working on that.

436
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,522
What about you--

437
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,457
back at the apartment?

438
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:39,553
What happened to you?

439
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:43,528
It's like something
was attacking me...

440
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,192
from the inside.

441
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,601
Okay. Okay.

442
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:52,871
Oh, my God.

443
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:55,207
You look better now.

444
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:57,304
I don't feel better.

445
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:01,780
I hate seeing you like this.

446
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:06,521
Like what?

447
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,990
It's like how nervous you get
before a game.

448
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,056
In college, right?

449
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,064
Yeah.

450
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,157
You remember that?

451
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,136
Of course l...

452
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,936
- We were dating.
- That's right. For more than a year.

453
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,271
And you played hockey.

454
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:30,245
You were still living
with your parents.

455
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:33,044
No. No!

456
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:35,482
This is okay.
This is-- This is good.

457
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:37,042
- But it didn't happen.
- No, because this did happen.

458
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,610
Do you remember the office?

459
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,987
You remember that?
You remember the taxicab?

460
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,047
Yeah.

461
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:45,652
When did you start remembering?

462
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:50,633
When you said I should remember.

463
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,931
When you said those things
about me not wanting to go home.

464
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:54,561
Right.

465
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,629
You couldn't possibly know that.

466
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:02,006
And the rest of it,
it just started coming back.

467
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:06,177
Are they following us?

468
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:11,812
No, not yet.

469
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,134
Okay.

470
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,643
I say we stay on this train
and travel as far as it goes.

471
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,644
Put some distance
between you and those things.

472
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:38,180
You don't understand. No amount
of distance is gonna stop them.

473
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,943
Well, it's a chance.

474
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:42,076
Hopefully it will give us some time.

475
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:44,017
How much time?

476
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,351
Enough time
so we don't get killed?

477
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:53,696
I'm sorry, all right?

478
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,994
I mean, I don't understand

479
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,658
why I keep bringing you into this,

480
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:00,532
but you need to just get
as far away from me as possible.

481
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,869
Hey, I'm with you, okay?

482
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,339
Okay?

483
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,641
Okay.

484
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,119
You look awful.

485
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,314
I could say the same about you.

486
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,683
So you're one of them.

487
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,721
A harvester.

488
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,433
We don't die.

489
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:48,967
We just keep going, feeding off them.

490
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:53,147
Feeding?

491
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,649
How?

492
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,050
I'll show you.

493
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,359
So you let him see you?

494
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,204
We feed on their fear.

495
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:52,471
So, w-what are you, like vampires?

496
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:57,438
It sustains us.

497
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:02,374
But we corrupted ourselves.

498
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,977
We began feeding
on human pain as well,

499
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:06,818
searching for it everywhere.

500
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,085
It's almost like an addiction.

501
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,992
And the fear one of them experiences

502
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:13,996
the moment before a violent death

503
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,827
is the most potent.

504
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:19,835
Our...drug of choice.

505
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,768
Once you've tasted it,
you never want to stop.

506
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:24,671
You need it more and more.

507
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:29,178
And when you can't find it,
you have to kill for it.

508
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:35,282
That's what turned us
from parasites into predators.

509
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:38,948
And you just keep hunting,

510
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,081
waiting to feed again.

511
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:44,218
S-So, how many of them are there?

512
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,888
I don't know anymore.

513
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:49,397
Why the hell are these things
coming after me?

514
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:52,333
You hurt them.

515
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:54,962
You did something to them,
and they won't let you remember

516
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:58,769
until they can work out how
to bring you back into the fold...

517
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,606
or destroy you.

518
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:07,215
You were the most powerful one.

519
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:11,518
They can't kill you, but together,

520
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:14,955
they have the power to move you
from life to life every day.

521
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:23,622
Such a simple thing.

522
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:30,765
How another can change us
so completely.

523
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,273
What are you talking about?

524
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,674
You have to protect her.

525
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:36,678
She's the only chance you have.

526
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:45,687
They found you.

527
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,785
- Jenny. Jenny, wake up. Wake up.
- What's wrong?

528
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:54,694
We gotta go.
Gotta go. Gotta go.

529
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:15,114
Sorry.

530
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,880
Bloody idiot.

531
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:19,683
Hello. Well done, man.

532
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,087
Run!

533
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,573
Ian. Ian! Ian!

534
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,188
You're tired, Ian.

535
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,288
Ian! Ian!

536
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,196
Ian, Ian,

537
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:06,167
Ian.

538
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:08,170
Silly name, really.

539
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,331
We could've chosen a better one.

540
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,170
Ian, please, you have to stand up.

541
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:13,709
I can't. I can't.

542
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:16,245
You can sense it.

543
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,804
Can't you?

544
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:23,514
- What's happening to me?
- You remember.

545
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,614
Blood always remembers.

546
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,123
- Ian!
- This one.

547
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:33,458
Medea, don't.

548
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,430
Why, Ian?

549
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,290
Pity?

550
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:40,769
For this?

551
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,437
But then necessity always
leaves an emotion.

552
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,270
Doesn't it?

553
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:53,774
Aw, you can smell her fear.

554
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:58,280
Just like the rest of us.

555
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:02,357
Come back to us, Ian.

556
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,624
We can be together again.

557
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,291
Take her.

558
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:30,315
Ian...

559
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,753
Kill her, Ian.

560
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:35,756
I--

561
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:37,053
Kill her, Ian.

562
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:41,653
Ian!

563
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,426
Come on, Ian.

564
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,933
Kill her.

565
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:55,140
No!

566
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,475
Stop.

567
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:58,980
Kill her now!

568
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,784
I'm sorry.

569
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:45,091
Hello?

570
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:49,195
Hello!

571
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,835
Help!

572
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:05,506
God! Help me!

573
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:11,983
No! Help!

574
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:48,446
Nobody can hear you, Ian.

575
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,685
Help!

576
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:55,723
Feeling better? No?

577
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:58,028
It's really quite simple.

578
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:00,035
Unless you feed,

579
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:01,263
you starve.

580
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:06,775
You're very difficult.

581
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:08,003
No!

582
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:10,443
It takes everything we have
to control you.

583
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:15,014
Still, those old memories
keep seeping back,

584
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,450
even though we wear you down,

585
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,182
killing you again and again

586
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:21,780
and again

587
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:23,826
and again.

588
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:27,158
So now it's time for answers.

589
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,563
How did you do it? Hmm?

590
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:34,262
Still don't remember?

591
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,532
Let me refresh your memory.

592
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,639
You killed one of us!

593
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:44,040
One of your own!

594
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:46,982
You shouldn't be capable of that.

595
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,382
I want to know how.

596
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,458
That was a very nice try.

597
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:59,620
Really, we know you've had
a little helper.

598
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:01,857
Where is he?

599
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,525
Hmm? I just want to know.

600
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,535
Is he one of us?

601
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,935
Another one like you, perhaps?

602
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:10,199
We're ready.

603
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:15,174
You're in need of treatment.

604
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:41,199
So you see why
we can't just let you go.

605
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,534
You're far too much of a threat.

606
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:45,631
A harvester

607
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:48,939
who kills his own kind.

608
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:53,476
And while we may not
be able to kill you,

609
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:58,512
we can certainly hurt you.

610
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:11,922
You turned on your own
and abandoned us.

611
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:15,536
Why did you do that?

612
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,971
I don't know.

613
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:22,069
I think you do,

614
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:23,976
but you've hidden it away,

615
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:28,672
and it's in there somewhere.

616
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:31,117
We just need to pull it out.

617
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,711
No. Wait, wait, wait!

618
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:33,881
Wait, wait...

619
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:46,761
You're getting weak, Ian.

620
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:49,464
But you won't die.

621
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:52,900
The pain'll only get worse,

622
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:57,579
and it will never end.

623
01:01:57,647 --> 01:02:00,582
You need to feed!

624
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,716
I won't.

625
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:06,621
Really?

626
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:08,714
I think we can change your mind.

627
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:12,861
Cross my heart

628
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,829
and hope to die!

629
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,559
No! No! No!

630
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,922
I know you're hungry.

631
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:44,926
But don't worry.

632
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:48,623
We always take care of family.

633
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,866
Hi, Toby.

634
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:55,199
How are you feeling now?
Is it better?

635
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,296
What do you want?

636
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:02,010
You can smell his fear.

637
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:05,570
Try and get some sleep now.
I'll check on you later.

638
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:12,714
Don't fight what you are.

639
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,449
Oh, well.
Waste not, want not.

640
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:31,070
No. No. He's just a kid.

641
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:39,911
Get away from him.

642
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:48,649
No!

643
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,764
Toby, what's wrong?

644
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,897
What's wrong, dear?

645
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:06,100
Dr. Gilbert!

646
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:07,301
Don't look at them.

647
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:13,541
Toby, it's fine. Don't worry.

648
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:16,210
Toby-- Toby, listen!

649
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:34,630
You're all right.

650
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,036
Stay with us.

651
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:01,595
No!

652
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:04,462
I don't enjoy this, Ian,
but you leave me no choice.

653
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,174
If they kill you, this is gonna happen
all over again.

654
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:20,212
That was quite a trick--

655
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:23,309
pulling her from one life to the next.

656
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:26,150
She's the reason, isn't she?

657
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,186
You have to protect her.

658
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,522
She's the only chance you have.

659
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,358
You left us for this!

660
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:37,362
But you know what I think?

661
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,732
Once she's gone,
you'll come back to us.

662
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:47,707
No!

663
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,904
They can do terrible things to her,

664
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:52,573
and that will be the end for you.

665
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,503
I'm sorry, Ian.

666
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,586
I hoped you could keep going--

667
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:36,789
go on protecting her.

668
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,795
I tried.

669
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,459
You must stop them, Ian.

670
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:48,263
What you draw from her,

671
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,999
it's more powerful than fear.

672
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:56,706
It will give you the strength
to destroy harvesters,

673
01:06:57,713 --> 01:06:59,977
but-- but also

674
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:02,449
the power to give life.

675
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:08,122
I can't.

676
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:11,116
Jenny.

677
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,161
Help her.

678
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:16,326
She changed you.

679
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:21,394
What am I supposed to do?

680
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:25,133
You don't understand.
You're not like the others.

681
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,641
Not anymore.

682
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:34,048
I killed so many, Ian.

683
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:39,652
When you begin your existence
in darkness,

684
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,246
it's all you know.

685
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:44,087
Everything you do is driven by it.

686
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:59,130
But I found one... like your Jenny.

687
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:04,540
She changed me, too.

688
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,016
How?

689
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,919
Fear and pain
were no longer my sustenance.

690
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:18,183
I found new life in her love.

691
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:21,789
It allowed me to fight back.

692
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:27,460
Until they took her.

693
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:04,234
So long as Jenny lives,

694
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,604
you have a choice.

695
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:10,971
You have a chance!

696
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:13,981
But you'll have to feed.

697
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:18,185
I can't.

698
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:20,279
You have to!

699
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:22,824
For Jenny.

700
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:24,826
I won't hurt anyone.

701
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:27,996
Not them.

702
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:31,660
You can help me go.

703
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:36,360
Please.

704
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:40,674
But you found love once.

705
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:44,435
You can find it again.

706
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:48,176
Don't you think I've been searching?

707
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:53,346
I'm tired, Ian.

708
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:58,222
It's my time.

709
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,842
Still a little afraid?

710
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,148
Find him.

711
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,331
- Good night.
- Good night.

712
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:46,486
Please...

713
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:49,216
Somebody help me!

714
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:02,826
Run!

715
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:41,800
Jenny!

716
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:47,470
Come get her, Ian.

717
01:14:47,549 --> 01:14:49,744
Ian!

718
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:35,789
Meddy, I promise

719
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:38,697
this won't end well for you.

720
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:46,839
My, my, my.

721
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:52,646
Let her go!

722
01:15:56,184 --> 01:16:00,314
The little angel
who saved your soul.

723
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,324
Where's the sparkle on this one?

724
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:08,955
Don't!

725
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:11,261
You disgust me!

726
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,460
You're not strong enough to stop me.

727
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:20,532
Others will come for you.

728
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:25,472
Maybe.

729
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:28,983
You're an infection.

730
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:31,178
This ends with you.

731
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:35,112
We've only just begun!

732
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,197
Is this what you want?

733
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,934
You want to go back
to playing house?

734
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:18,060
Or maybe you like it here.

735
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:20,931
I'll do it to your world, Ian.

736
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:22,732
You're mine.

737
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:25,068
You're always mine.

738
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:40,587
Now I'll have to start all over again.

739
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:45,221
What would you like
your next life to be?

740
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:47,887
One thing I can promise you,

741
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:50,329
it won't be pleasant,

742
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:53,459
and she will certainly
not be part of it.

743
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,559
Meddy...

744
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:57,298
You can stop this now.

745
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:00,340
No.

746
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:03,003
You can feel it, can't you?

747
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,344
This is why we have to feed.

748
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:12,680
You're right.

749
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,491
Such a simple thing.

750
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:26,329
It will give you the strength
to destroy harvesters

751
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:29,302
and the power to give life.

752
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:38,010
Shh. Look at me. I'm right here.

753
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,241
- I'm right here.
- Ian...

754
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:42,283
You're not gonna remember
any of this, all right?

755
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,910
Everything's gonna be all right now.
You have to trust me.

756
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:49,884
I love you.

757
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,918
Come on!

758
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:05,026
Whoo! Yeah!

759
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:17,140
Hey.

760
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:26,120
So, how does it feel to be the hero?

761
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:27,746
Oh, you're a goddess!

762
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,723
I think I could get used to this.

763
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:31,725
- Not such a bad life, isn't it?
- No, it's not.

764
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:33,693
And if I had to pick one,
it would definitely be this.

765
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:35,286
Me, too.

766
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:38,794
Is it my turn now?

767
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:40,732
Drunk bastard, get out of here.

768
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:43,737
Good job, Ian.

769
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:45,067
Thank you.

770
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:46,607
For what?

771
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,336
For making me human.

772
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:49,843
What does that mean?

773
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:53,847
Maybe someday I'll tell you.

774
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:09,992
You know what?

775
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:11,930
I need to go take care of something.

776
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,934
- You're leaving?
- I am. Just for five seconds.

777
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:16,630
- I just gotta go talk to somebody.
- Okay.

778
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,696
- And get back here fast.
- I will.

779
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:58,302
What's the matter?

780
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,972
Scared?

781
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:03,049
