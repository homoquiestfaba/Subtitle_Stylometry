1
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,979
Uh, Charlie-Fox, Charlie-Fox-6,

2
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,483
Roger, be advised...

3
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:28,491
We'll have resupplies
down by chopper. Over.

4
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:30,492
Strong shit, man.

5
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,747
Where the fuck are the
God damn gooks already?

6
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:38,751
I don't think they're even out there.

7
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:42,003
Jesus, this shit's something else.

8
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:50,128
Hey, Professor, how many times

9
00:03:50,628 --> 00:03:52,882
can you shit in an hour?

10
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:57,635
Professor got beaucoupshits, man.

11
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,525
Why do you even bother pulling them up?

12
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:06,645
You jerking off again, huh, Jake?

13
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:09,532
Come over here and jerk on this.

14
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:11,032
Come choke my black root.

15
00:04:15,653 --> 00:04:17,656
Please?

16
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:19,408
He's asking politely.

17
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:21,911
Ain't got a fucking tweezer, man.

18
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,663
Oh, ho! Yeah!

19
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:27,550
Shit! We got movement in the treeline.

20
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,168
Shit!

21
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,802
Movement in the treeline!

22
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:35,807
1, 3, 2, 0!

23
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:38,677
Fuck, something's wrong.

24
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:40,678
What the fuck's wrong with you?

25
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:42,180
Motherfuck.

26
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,682


27
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:44,934
It's my head.

28
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:50,072
Help me!

29
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:51,824
Get up!

30
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,826
Paul, help me!

31
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:55,076
Get up!

32
00:04:55,577 --> 00:04:57,079
Help me!

33
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,831
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Get up!

34
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,084
Medic!

35
00:05:02,584 --> 00:05:03,586
Medic! Stop it!

36
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:07,088
Aah!

37
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,706
Medic, we need you here!

38
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:10,593
Come on, man.

39
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:11,593
Stop it!

40
00:05:11,593 --> 00:05:14,346
Aah!

41
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:16,598
Medic!

42
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,728
1, 2, 3, 0!

43
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:31,613
Fire!

44
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,384
Aah!

45
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:55,254
My arm! My arm!

46
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:57,255
Aw, fuck!

47
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:11,220
Aah!

48
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,694
Oh, God.

49
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:21,829
Fucking shit!

50
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:51,392


51
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:58,399


52
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:37,633
Excuse me.

53
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,634
Uh...

54
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:43,504
Do you know if we've passed
Bergen Street yet?

55
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:47,509
Bergen?

56
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,514
Um, I fell asleep.

57
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:04,158
Um, all right. Ok.

58
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,951
Fuck.

59
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:43,652
Shit.

60
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:57,869
Hey, Chester.

61
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,871
Go back to sleep.

62
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,210
Get insomnia again?

63
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,662
Jake, is that you?

64
00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:09,663


65
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:12,667
Did you move all the furniture?

66
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:16,171
I just moved the chair, that's all.

67
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:17,923
That help?

68
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,926
Yeah, thanks.

69
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:24,929
So what do you think?

70
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:25,931
About what?

71
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:27,932
The room.

72
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:30,434
Ask me tomorrow.

73
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,687
It is tomorrow.

74
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:36,691
How come you're so late?

75
00:14:36,691 --> 00:14:39,577
Bud Nash didn't show up again.

76
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:41,078
Called in sick.

77
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:43,081
He's always sick.

78
00:14:43,197 --> 00:14:44,698
So I worked.

79
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,201
Got some overtime.

80
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:49,955
What happened to your pants?

81
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:52,957
Don't ask.

82
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,961
You look terrible.

83
00:14:57,211 --> 00:14:58,212
Thanks.

84
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,261


85
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:54,769
Help me.

86
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,138
Help me.

87
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,395
Oh, fuck.

88
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,152
You're up?

89
00:16:10,152 --> 00:16:12,653
Oh, fuck.

90
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:27,168
What's that?

91
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:29,553
Your kid dropped it off.

92
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:32,057
Who, Jed?

93
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,557
No, the little one.

94
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:35,059
Eli.

95
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:37,562
Why can't you remember their names?

96
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:39,931
They're weird names.

97
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:43,934
They're biblical names.

98
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:46,937
They were prophets.

99
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:48,440
Well, personally,

100
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,942
I never went for church names.

101
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:53,445


102
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:54,946
What?

103
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:58,450
Where do you think Jezebel came from?

104
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,335
Nobody calls me that.

105
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:04,838
You're such a heathen, Jezzie.

106
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,093
How'd I ever get involved

107
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,595
with such a fucking ninny?

108
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:13,597
You sold your soul, remember?

109
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:15,099
That's what you told me.

110
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,601
Yeah? For what?

111
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:18,103
A good lay.

112
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,105
Look what I got--

113
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:22,106
- The best.
- The best.

114
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:32,233
So what's in the bag?

115
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,734
Pictures.

116
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:35,737
Your wife was tossing them,

117
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:38,740
so what's-his-name dropped
it over before school.

118
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,241
Eli.

119
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:42,243
Eli. Ee-lie.

120
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:49,000


121
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:53,505
These are great.

122
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:03,647
Yeah?

123
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:07,152
Look at this baby.

124
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,653
Aw, who's that?

125
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:11,155
Isn't that the cutest
baby you've ever seen?

126
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:12,656
Little fat little thing.

127
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:14,659
That's me.

128
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:17,162
That's you? Let me see.

129
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:20,164
No, that's all right.
This fat little thing.

130
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:22,666
You don't have to look.

131
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,670
Who's this?

132
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,173
Sarah.

133
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:30,674
Sarah.

134
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:33,178
I can see what you mean.

135
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:35,297
What?

136
00:18:35,797 --> 00:18:37,298
Why you left.

137
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,301
What do you mean?

138
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:43,054
Jake, she looks like a real bitch.

139
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:47,057
Well, she looked good then.

140
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:49,059
Not to me.

141
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:51,061
You didn't marry her.

142
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:12,717
Hello, baby.

143
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,721
How you doing?

144
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:35,856
What's wrong?

145
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:50,121
Is this the one who died

146
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,757
before you went to Vietnam?

147
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:56,260
Yeah, it's Gabe.

148
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,763
Oh, God.

149
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:01,266
Sorry.

150
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:04,269
Took me by surprise.

151
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,271
I didn't expect to see him today.

152
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:12,644
What are you doing?
Stop it!

153
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:20,285
I don't like things that make you cry.

154
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:33,298
I didn't cry.

155
00:21:03,744 --> 00:21:07,248
When there are gray skies 

156
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,252
I don't mind the gray skies 

157
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:16,758
You'll make them blue 

158
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:23,263
Sonny boy 

159
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:40,147
Hey, Donald.

160
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,150
In to get your check?

161
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,152
You one greedy motherfucker, man.

162
00:21:44,152 --> 00:21:46,153
Don't you know that?

163
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:03,805
Hi.

164
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,561
How's it going?

165
00:22:11,061 --> 00:22:13,064
Better now.

166
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:14,065
Yeah?

167
00:22:14,065 --> 00:22:15,066
Mmm.

168
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:16,567
I'm going to go home.

169
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:18,068
What's wrong?

170
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:19,570
Just one of those days.

171
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,073
My back's killing me.
I'll go see Louie.

172
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,692
Not again. Your boss will kill you.

173
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:26,577
What can you do?

174
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:31,082
Well, I'll miss riding home with you.

175
00:22:31,332 --> 00:22:32,834
I was looking forward to it.

176
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:34,836
Easy. My back.

177
00:22:35,336 --> 00:22:36,336


178
00:22:36,336 --> 00:22:39,339
Come on, Jake,
that didn't hurt.

179
00:22:39,707 --> 00:22:41,209
How do you know?

180
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:43,711
I know you.

181
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:46,213
How come you're so tense today?

182
00:22:46,213 --> 00:22:48,715
I don't know.
What can I tell you?

183
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:50,969
I saw Sarah the other day.

184
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:51,970
Oh, yeah?

185
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:52,971
Mm-hmm.

186
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,972
Her knee acting up?

187
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:56,974
A bit.

188
00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:59,477
So what did she have to say?

189
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:01,863
Turn on your right side.

190
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:05,866
How about the other right?

191
00:23:05,866 --> 00:23:07,868
I don't understand you philosophers.

192
00:23:07,868 --> 00:23:09,737
You got the world figured out,

193
00:23:09,737 --> 00:23:12,240
But you can't remember your left.

194
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,740
What did she say?

195
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,741
Not much.

196
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:16,743
She's like you that way--

197
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:17,744
two clams.

198
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:19,747
No wonder your marriage didn't last.

199
00:23:20,248 --> 00:23:22,250
Put your hand on your hip.

200
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,751
Take a deep breath...

201
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:27,255
And let it out slowly,

202
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:28,756
slowly...

203
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:29,757


204
00:23:30,758 --> 00:23:32,259
That's good.

205
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:34,645
Now turn to your left.

206
00:23:36,146 --> 00:23:38,650
Did she talk about the boys?

207
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,402
She said you're a son of a bitch,

208
00:23:41,402 --> 00:23:44,404
and she regrets the day she met you.

209
00:23:44,404 --> 00:23:46,406
Thought she didn't say much.

210
00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:48,910
That's all she said.
Hand on your hip.

211
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,912
Take a breath.

212
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:52,413
Easy...

213
00:23:52,913 --> 00:23:53,914


214
00:23:53,914 --> 00:23:55,916
On your back.

215
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,921
I think she still loves you.

216
00:24:00,421 --> 00:24:01,923
I don't think so.

217
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:05,425
She doesn't stop talking about you.

218
00:24:07,428 --> 00:24:08,930
That's love, Jake.

219
00:24:10,932 --> 00:24:12,683
You should go back to her.

220
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:14,685
She threw me out, remember?

221
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:18,189
Your problem is you spent
six years getting a Ph.D.

222
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:20,441
then went to work for the post office.

223
00:24:20,441 --> 00:24:22,442
What can I tell you?

224
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:24,945
After 'Nam, I didn't
want to think anymore.

225
00:24:25,445 --> 00:24:28,566
Any other brain but yours, I'd agree.

226
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:30,067
Now relax...

227
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:34,071
Relax. This is going
to be a little strong.

228
00:24:34,571 --> 00:24:35,573
That a boy.

229
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,709
That a boy.

230
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:42,713
I found one.

231
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:45,215
I think he's still alive.

232
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:52,222
Wh--

233
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:53,724
What did you...

234
00:24:53,724 --> 00:24:55,593
What did you do to me?

235
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:57,595
I had to get in there.

236
00:24:57,595 --> 00:24:59,096
It's a deep adjustment.

237
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:00,682
Rest a moment.

238
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:02,182
Let it set a bit.

239
00:25:02,683 --> 00:25:04,184
I had a weird flash.

240
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:05,569
What?

241
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,070
I don't know.

242
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:09,574
I've been having them recently.

243
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:15,496
You know, you look
like an angel, Louie.

244
00:25:15,496 --> 00:25:17,365
Like an overgrown cherub.

245
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:20,117
Anyone ever tell you that?

246
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:22,619
Yeah.

247
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:23,621
You.

248
00:25:23,621 --> 00:25:25,623
Every time I see you.

249
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,544
You're a lifesaver, Louie.

250
00:25:29,544 --> 00:25:31,546
I know.

251
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:40,887


252
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:44,392
Mr. Postman.

253
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:46,894
Mr. Postman.

254
00:25:46,894 --> 00:25:48,395
Where's your letters, baby?

255
00:25:48,395 --> 00:25:49,896
Hey, Mr. Postman.

256
00:25:50,397 --> 00:25:51,531
Where's your bag?

257
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:53,901
Shake your thing.

258
00:25:54,902 --> 00:25:55,903
Wait 

259
00:25:55,903 --> 00:25:58,405
Oh, yes, wait a minute, Mr. Postman 

260
00:25:58,405 --> 00:26:02,910
Wait, Mr. Postman 

261
00:26:03,294 --> 00:26:05,296
Please, Mr. Postman, look and see 

262
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:06,297
whoa, yeah 

263
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:10,050
if there's a letter in your bag for me 

264
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,804
I've been waitin' for such a long time 

265
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,305
whoa, yeah 

266
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:16,173
Where you going?

267
00:26:16,557 --> 00:26:19,059
We don't remember the words.
I'm sorry.

268
00:26:23,564 --> 00:26:26,067


269
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:28,318
Look out!

270
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:11,444
Singer?

271
00:27:11,444 --> 00:27:13,948
Please, Elizabeth, sit down.

272
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,451
I need to see Dr. Carlson, please.

273
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:19,953
Carlson?

274
00:27:19,953 --> 00:27:21,454
Is he new here?

275
00:27:21,454 --> 00:27:23,958
No, he's been here for years.

276
00:27:29,462 --> 00:27:31,464
Not according to my charts.

277
00:27:31,464 --> 00:27:33,467
Do you have an appointment?

278
00:27:34,468 --> 00:27:35,970
I need to see him.

279
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,471
I know where his room is.

280
00:27:38,471 --> 00:27:40,974
Just give me a pass.

281
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:43,978
Our doctors are seen
by appointment only.

282
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:45,980
Damn.

283
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,982
I was in the veterans'
outpatient program.

284
00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:50,483
He knows me.

285
00:27:51,986 --> 00:27:53,487
What was your name?

286
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:56,490
Singer. Jacob singer.

287
00:27:57,991 --> 00:28:00,493
I've got a lot of work here.

288
00:28:00,493 --> 00:28:02,496
Haven't even had lunch yet.

289
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:22,516
I'm sorry, but, uh...

290
00:28:22,516 --> 00:28:25,019
there's no record of a Jacob Singer

291
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:26,519
in our files.

292
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:28,521
What do you mean, no record?

293
00:28:29,022 --> 00:28:30,523
Shall I spell it out?

294
00:28:31,025 --> 00:28:32,526
There is nothing there.

295
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:33,527
That's ridiculous.

296
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:36,529
I've been coming here for years.

297
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:39,032
Listen to me. I'm--I'm...

298
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:47,040
I, uh...I need to see Dr. Carlson.

299
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,541
If it's an emergency,

300
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:51,045
we have a staff of psychiatric
social workers.

301
00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:52,546
There's an hour's wait.

302
00:28:52,546 --> 00:28:54,915
Would you just fill out
this form, please?

303
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:57,417
I don't want any social worker.

304
00:28:57,417 --> 00:28:58,920


305
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,421
I want Dr. Carlson.

306
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:02,423
He knows me.

307
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,682
Hey! Come back here!

308
00:29:23,193 --> 00:29:24,577
Hey!

309
00:29:25,078 --> 00:29:27,080
Hey, come back here!

310
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,449
Hey!

311
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:35,839
Look out.

312
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:37,090
Get out of here.

313
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,093
Hey, come on!

314
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:40,594
Hold him.

315
00:29:40,594 --> 00:29:42,596
He made it.

316
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,221
Can I help you?

317
00:29:53,223 --> 00:29:54,724
Where's Dr. Carlson?

318
00:29:54,724 --> 00:29:56,727
Isn't this his office?

319
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,481
Be just a minute.

320
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:08,489
Why don't we step out in the hall?

321
00:30:08,489 --> 00:30:09,990
It's ok.

322
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:21,885
I'm so sorry.

323
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:23,887
Dr. Carlson died.

324
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:26,390
Died?

325
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,893
It was a car accident.

326
00:30:29,393 --> 00:30:31,394
Oh, Jesus.

327
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:35,148
Oh, Jesus.

328
00:30:37,651 --> 00:30:39,403
When?

329
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:41,404
Uh, about a month ago.

330
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:43,656
Just before Thanksgiving.

331
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,161
How'd it happen?

332
00:30:47,161 --> 00:30:48,662
No one really knows.

333
00:30:48,662 --> 00:30:51,164
They say it blew up.

334
00:30:52,665 --> 00:30:53,666
Blew up?

335
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:56,170
What do you mean, blew up?

336
00:30:57,171 --> 00:30:58,672
I really don't know.

337
00:30:58,672 --> 00:31:02,175
Is there anything I can do for you?

338
00:31:02,675 --> 00:31:03,294
Do you...

339
00:31:03,794 --> 00:31:06,297
Do you want me to get you someone?

340
00:31:06,797 --> 00:31:08,298
No...

341
00:31:08,298 --> 00:31:10,183
I'm ok.

342
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,701
Maybe it's the pressure, Jake.

343
00:31:30,203 --> 00:31:31,704
You know, the money.

344
00:31:31,704 --> 00:31:33,207
Things like that.

345
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:37,161
Or your wife.

346
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,663
Why do you bring her up?

347
00:31:41,164 --> 00:31:43,666
She's always on your mind.

348
00:31:44,718 --> 00:31:47,221
I never talk about her.

349
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:50,723
It has nothing to do with talking.

350
00:31:54,228 --> 00:31:56,212
Maybe it's the war.

351
00:31:56,212 --> 00:31:58,766
You can't spend two years in Vietnam

352
00:31:58,766 --> 00:31:59,767
and expect--

353
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:01,769
Aw, jezzie, come on.

354
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:05,772
How does that explain
barricaded subway stations

355
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:07,907
or these fucking creatures?

356
00:32:07,907 --> 00:32:09,576
Creatures?

357
00:32:09,576 --> 00:32:12,579
Jake, New York is filled with creatures,

358
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:15,583
and lots of stations are closed.

359
00:32:20,587 --> 00:32:21,588
They're like...

360
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:23,590
demons, Jezz.

361
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:27,595
Demons?

362
00:32:28,095 --> 00:32:30,096
Jake, honey...

363
00:32:30,096 --> 00:32:32,599
they're winos and bag ladies.

364
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:34,101
Lowlife. That's all they are.

365
00:32:34,602 --> 00:32:36,604
The streets are crawling with them.

366
00:32:37,104 --> 00:32:40,106
Don't make them into something
they're not, hmm?

367
00:32:40,607 --> 00:32:42,609
These guys were trying to kill me.

368
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:44,111
They were aiming at me.

369
00:32:44,612 --> 00:32:45,613
Kids on a joy ride.

370
00:32:46,113 --> 00:32:48,115
It happens all the time.

371
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:55,105
They were inhuman.

372
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,211
Oh, come on.

373
00:33:04,531 --> 00:33:06,317
What were they, Jake?

374
00:33:14,508 --> 00:33:16,009
You still love me?

375
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:23,851
What?

376
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:25,435
Do you love me?

377
00:33:27,086 --> 00:33:28,605
Yeah.

378
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:34,994
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir 

379
00:33:34,994 --> 00:33:37,748
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi... 

380
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,759
Hey, where are you going?

381
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:50,760
Come with me.

382
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,512
Do you have a girlfriend?

383
00:33:52,512 --> 00:33:54,548
Do you like her an awful lot?

384
00:33:54,548 --> 00:33:56,049
Want a new girlfriend?

385
00:33:56,049 --> 00:33:58,519
I live very close to here,

386
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,056
and I'm very lonely.

387
00:34:02,056 --> 00:34:04,942


388
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:07,478


389
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:09,480
More 

390
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,481
More 

391
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,615
More 

392
00:34:12,615 --> 00:34:16,369
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi 

393
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:20,490
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir 

394
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,494
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi 

395
00:34:24,494 --> 00:34:27,748
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir 

396
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:32,001
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi 

397
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:35,505
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir... 

398
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:37,007
Hey.

399
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,010
Let me look at your hand.

400
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,012
No, thanks.

401
00:34:42,012 --> 00:34:43,896
Go ahead, Jake. Let her.

402
00:34:43,896 --> 00:34:45,398
She's real good.

403
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:47,400
Come on.

404
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,402
It's fun.

405
00:34:48,402 --> 00:34:50,403
You left-handed or right-handed?

406
00:34:50,903 --> 00:34:52,405
Um...right.

407
00:34:52,405 --> 00:34:54,407
Give it to me.

408
00:34:54,407 --> 00:34:56,409
Ok.

409
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:58,911
Mm-hmm. Married man.

410
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:01,914
Please.

411
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,918
Oh, no.

412
00:35:05,418 --> 00:35:07,920
Oh, divorce.

413
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,422
I like that.

414
00:35:09,422 --> 00:35:11,425
You see this here, that split?

415
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:12,425
Where?

416
00:35:12,425 --> 00:35:13,927
Right here.

417
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:17,431
It's a paper cut.

418
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:21,434
Ooh, and a sense of humor, too.

419
00:35:21,434 --> 00:35:22,936
I love it.

420
00:35:24,438 --> 00:35:26,940
Hey, Jake, Jake.

421
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,943
Come on, baby, dance
with me just one, huh?

422
00:35:30,943 --> 00:35:32,445
What, are you flirting?

423
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:34,947
Hi.

424
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:41,954
Let's see, this is your heart line...

425
00:35:41,954 --> 00:35:44,958
and your head line.

426
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:46,460
Huh?

427
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:53,467
And your life line.

428
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:56,469
You have a very strange line, hon.

429
00:35:58,472 --> 00:36:00,474
No, it's not funny.

430
00:36:00,474 --> 00:36:04,478
See, according to this,
you're already dead.

431
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,981
You're out of here, baby.

432
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:09,483
What can you do?

433
00:36:09,483 --> 00:36:14,521
Just give me your blue
eyes before you go, ok?

434
00:36:24,164 --> 00:36:26,666
Wait, wait. Jake, come here.

435
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:29,168
Come on, come on, you can dance.

436
00:36:29,168 --> 00:36:30,286
I don't want to.

437
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,672
Come on, baby, shake it.

438
00:36:38,177 --> 00:36:39,679
Come on, man, move those legs.

439
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:41,181
Move them size 13s.

440
00:36:41,181 --> 00:36:45,184
Those are some big fucking feet.
Shit.

441
00:37:24,224 --> 00:37:26,342


442
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,253


443
00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:01,320


444
00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:10,197


445
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:12,449


446
00:39:18,054 --> 00:39:19,822


447
00:39:19,822 --> 00:39:20,840
Jesus, look at that.

448
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,342
His guts are hanging out.

449
00:39:22,342 --> 00:39:25,846
You'll have to push them back in.

450
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:29,215
I have never--

451
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:32,853
I have never been so
mortified in my whole life.

452
00:39:32,853 --> 00:39:34,855
Screaming like that.

453
00:39:34,855 --> 00:39:38,474
I don't understand what's
gotten into you, Jake.

454
00:39:38,474 --> 00:39:40,476
You're not acting normal.

455
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:43,230
There's been too many
crazies in my life.

456
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,731
I don't want it anymore.

457
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,985
I'm tired of men flipping out on me.

458
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,621
If you go crazy,

459
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:53,489
You're going crazy by yourself,
you understand?

460
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,126
What's it say?

461
00:39:58,128 --> 00:40:01,380
Oh, my God. I'm calling the doctor.

462
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,882
What's it say?

463
00:40:02,882 --> 00:40:04,635
It's gone to the top.

464
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:07,753
Great.

465
00:40:08,755 --> 00:40:10,757
Dr. Forrest, I'm so sorry to bother you.

466
00:40:11,257 --> 00:40:13,760
This is Jezzie Pipkin up on 14-G.

467
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,762
I just took Jake's temperature,

468
00:40:15,762 --> 00:40:17,264
and it says 106.

469
00:40:17,264 --> 00:40:18,764
Could that be right?

470
00:40:20,016 --> 00:40:21,518
Oh, my God.

471
00:40:22,518 --> 00:40:25,271
Oh, my God.

472
00:40:29,409 --> 00:40:30,911
Get out of bed.

473
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:32,913
I can't. I'm freezing.

474
00:40:32,913 --> 00:40:35,414
Jake, for Pete's sake, get out of bed!

475
00:40:38,784 --> 00:40:40,286
What did the doctor say?

476
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:44,041
That you'd die on the
way to the hospital.

477
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,541
Come on, up, up.

478
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:51,181
Hold on, hold on.

479
00:40:51,181 --> 00:40:53,182
You're going to be ok, Jake.

480
00:40:55,184 --> 00:40:56,936
What are you doing?

481
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,440
I need more ice.

482
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,942
I'm freezing!

483
00:41:03,443 --> 00:41:05,945


484
00:41:05,945 --> 00:41:07,447
What's happening?

485
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:11,952
I need some ice. He's
running a 106 fever.

486
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:13,570
It's an emergency-- ice.

487
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,072
Thank you.

488
00:41:16,072 --> 00:41:17,574
Come on, sam.

489
00:41:18,824 --> 00:41:19,826
Oh, my God.

490
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:23,329
Oh, Jake, oh, Jake,
don't you die on me.

491
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:24,831
Sam, help me!

492
00:41:24,831 --> 00:41:25,831
Sam!

493
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:26,833
I'll help.

494
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:28,335
Come on.

495
00:41:28,335 --> 00:41:29,835
Be careful with him.

496
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:30,836
Hold on.

497
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:32,838
Come on. It's for your own good.

498
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,340
Come on, Jake.

499
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,842
Come on, get him in there.

500
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:38,478
You're going to be fine.

501
00:41:38,978 --> 00:41:41,981


502
00:41:45,235 --> 00:41:46,235
Hold him! Hold him!

503
00:41:46,485 --> 00:41:48,989
It's going to be ok.

504
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:49,989
Is he all right?

505
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:52,992
He doesn't like this.

506
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:58,748
Help me!

507
00:41:58,748 --> 00:42:01,501


508
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:02,501
Stop it!

509
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:06,005
Jake, don't you die on me.

510
00:42:06,005 --> 00:42:08,375
Stop it! You're killing me!

511
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:30,396


512
00:42:37,903 --> 00:42:39,405


513
00:42:39,905 --> 00:42:40,907
Shit.

514
00:42:40,907 --> 00:42:42,409
What was that?

515
00:42:42,409 --> 00:42:44,911
I'm freezing.

516
00:42:44,911 --> 00:42:46,413
I'm not cold.

517
00:42:46,413 --> 00:42:49,916
Of course not. You have all the covers.

518
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,922
Must be 10 degrees in here.

519
00:43:01,427 --> 00:43:04,431
I'm telling you, Sarah...

520
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:06,432
if you want fresh air,

521
00:43:06,432 --> 00:43:08,934
you can sleep on the fire escape.

522
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:11,688
From now on, that window's closed.

523
00:43:11,688 --> 00:43:14,690
It's not healthy when it's closed.

524
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,693
Healthy? You call this healthy?

525
00:43:16,693 --> 00:43:18,195
I'm going to die of pneumonia.

526
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:19,695
This is healthy?

527
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:28,672
What a dream I was having.

528
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:31,173
I was living with another woman.

529
00:43:34,126 --> 00:43:36,630
You know who it was?

530
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,181
I don't want to know.

531
00:43:39,181 --> 00:43:41,184
Jezebel from the post office.

532
00:43:41,184 --> 00:43:42,686
You remember her.

533
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:47,389
You met her at the
Christmas Party that time.

534
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:49,425
I was living with her.

535
00:43:51,143 --> 00:43:52,711
God, what a nightmare.

536
00:43:57,266 --> 00:43:59,786
There were all these demons,

537
00:43:59,786 --> 00:44:02,289
and I was on fire.

538
00:44:03,789 --> 00:44:06,293
I was burning from ice.

539
00:44:09,795 --> 00:44:11,797
Guilty thoughts.

540
00:44:12,298 --> 00:44:14,835
See what happens when you cheat on me,

541
00:44:14,835 --> 00:44:17,387
even in your mind?

542
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:21,423
She was really good in bed.

543
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,195
Go to sleep.

544
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,900
She had these great thighs.

545
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,572
Oh, I thought you said
it was a nightmare.

546
00:44:38,074 --> 00:44:39,074
It was.

547
00:44:39,074 --> 00:44:40,577
It was a nightmare.

548
00:44:42,077 --> 00:44:46,081
It was a terrible, terrible nightmare.

549
00:44:49,585 --> 00:44:52,088
Daddy, what was that noise?

550
00:45:00,096 --> 00:45:02,599
What are you doing up?

551
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:06,603
It's cold.

552
00:45:07,103 --> 00:45:08,103
Well, tell your mother.

553
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,106
Go back to bed, darling.

554
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:13,559
Will you tuck me in?

555
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:17,063
Who, her?

556
00:45:17,063 --> 00:45:19,565
No. Daddy.

557
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:21,568
Shit.

558
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:23,068
Good night, sweetheart.

559
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:28,074
Oh, God. Come on.

560
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,961
Good night, darling.

561
00:45:33,463 --> 00:45:35,465


562
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,469


563
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,974
Ok. Close your eyes.

564
00:45:49,478 --> 00:45:52,431


565
00:46:02,909 --> 00:46:06,862
I don't mind the gray skies 

566
00:46:06,862 --> 00:46:08,864
You make the moon-- 

567
00:46:08,864 --> 00:46:10,333
Blue?

568
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,836
Sonny boy 

569
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:17,172
When I'm old and gray, dear 

570
00:46:17,172 --> 00:46:20,043
Promise you won't stray, dear 

571
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:23,512
I love you so 

572
00:46:23,512 --> 00:46:24,931
Sonny-- 

573
00:46:25,431 --> 00:46:26,349
Boy 

574
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:28,851
Dad?

575
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:29,853
Yeah, Jed?

576
00:46:30,353 --> 00:46:33,356
You forgot my allowance.

577
00:46:33,356 --> 00:46:34,858
Your allowance?

578
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,860
It's 5:00 in the morning.

579
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,228
We'll talk about it at breakfast.

580
00:46:39,728 --> 00:46:42,731
All right, but don't forget.

581
00:46:42,731 --> 00:46:44,733
I love you, Dad.

582
00:46:46,235 --> 00:46:48,237
What is this, a convention?

583
00:46:48,237 --> 00:46:50,239
I love you too, Pickles.

584
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:52,242
Go back to sleep.

585
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,244
Wait.

586
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:55,744
Don't go.

587
00:46:57,246 --> 00:46:59,748
I'm not going anywhere.

588
00:46:59,748 --> 00:47:01,751
I'm right here.

589
00:47:01,751 --> 00:47:04,253
Close your eyes.

590
00:47:05,755 --> 00:47:08,757
See you in the morning.

591
00:47:08,757 --> 00:47:10,260
Don't shut it.

592
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,762
Open it a bit more.

593
00:47:13,762 --> 00:47:15,264
There?

594
00:47:15,264 --> 00:47:17,266
A little bit more.

595
00:47:17,266 --> 00:47:18,268
There?

596
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,269
Good.

597
00:47:58,291 --> 00:48:00,393
I love you, Sarah.

598
00:48:29,271 --> 00:48:30,773
Watch the head.

599
00:48:32,157 --> 00:48:33,275
Move it!

600
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:36,913
Don't think we got a
fucking chance down here.

601
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,380
Declare an emergency. Over.

602
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,699


603
00:49:11,697 --> 00:49:13,199
You're a lucky guy, Jake.

604
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:16,202
You must have friends in high places.

605
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:47,409
Let's get down to Orson.

606
00:50:47,409 --> 00:50:49,913
I was going to vote for three,

607
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:51,914
and I switched to two
with some trepidation,

608
00:50:51,914 --> 00:50:53,916
because she said one over one,

609
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:56,920
which means number one
of an addition of one.

610
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,922
I think an artist would know that.

611
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,313
Jake?

612
00:51:16,688 --> 00:51:20,577
You're going to be all right, Jake.

613
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,445
Oh, you're going to be fine.

614
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:30,452
Am I...

615
00:51:30,452 --> 00:51:32,588
Am I home?

616
00:51:32,588 --> 00:51:36,092
Yeah. You're right here.

617
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:37,460
Home.

618
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:43,465
Doctor says you're lucky
your brains didn't boil.

619
00:51:46,969 --> 00:51:49,472
What a night, Jake, huh?

620
00:51:49,722 --> 00:51:53,226
You were screaming and kicking...

621
00:51:53,476 --> 00:51:56,478
and you kept saying,

622
00:51:56,478 --> 00:51:58,981
"Sarah, close the window,"

623
00:51:59,114 --> 00:52:01,117
over and over.

624
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:03,619
And talking to your kids,

625
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,989
even the dead one.

626
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:08,240
Weird, huh?

627
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:16,748
You know you melted 50 pounds
of ice in 8 hours?

628
00:52:21,253 --> 00:52:23,389
Am I dead?

629
00:52:25,891 --> 00:52:27,893
Oh, no.

630
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,898
No. You're right here.

631
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,402
Doctor says you got to rest.

632
00:52:36,402 --> 00:52:39,405
You see, he says you have a virus.

633
00:52:39,405 --> 00:52:41,407
That's what they always say

634
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:44,409
when they don't know what it is.

635
00:52:44,409 --> 00:52:48,164
Now, you just lie here, ok?

636
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:55,264
You know, you really
ought to get out today.

637
00:53:57,766 --> 00:53:59,768
You can't just sit around
like this all the time.

638
00:53:59,768 --> 00:54:01,269
It's not healthy.

639
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:04,273
It's not good for your mind.

640
00:54:06,909 --> 00:54:09,911
Go take a walk or something.

641
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,914
Do something.

642
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,782
Go to a movie.

643
00:54:13,782 --> 00:54:15,784
Go enjoy yourself.

644
00:54:15,784 --> 00:54:19,789
One of us should be having a good time.

645
00:54:24,793 --> 00:54:27,179
Anybody in there?

646
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:28,681
Anybody home?

647
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,802
Who are you?

648
00:54:33,302 --> 00:54:35,304
Fuck you.

649
00:54:35,804 --> 00:54:37,440
Two weeks of this shit!

650
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,940
I've had enough.

651
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:41,811
Go ahead and rot if you want.

652
00:54:48,317 --> 00:54:51,320
Have a good fucking day.

653
00:54:56,576 --> 00:54:59,077


654
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:06,085


655
00:55:08,588 --> 00:55:09,588
Hello.

656
00:55:09,588 --> 00:55:10,590
Jake?

657
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:12,592
Yeah?

658
00:55:12,592 --> 00:55:15,094
It's Paul. Paul Gruniger.

659
00:55:15,094 --> 00:55:17,597
Paul Gruniger.

660
00:55:17,597 --> 00:55:18,597
Paul.

661
00:55:18,597 --> 00:55:21,099
Paul Gruniger. Jesus, how are you?

662
00:55:21,099 --> 00:55:23,603
It's been like five, six years.

663
00:55:23,603 --> 00:55:24,987
Yeah. A long time.

664
00:55:25,487 --> 00:55:26,989
So, what's up?

665
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:28,608
Nothing much.

666
00:55:28,608 --> 00:55:31,110
Yeah. Well, same here.

667
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:33,246
I need to see you, Jake.

668
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,246
I'd love to see you, man,

669
00:55:34,246 --> 00:55:36,748
But I've been laid up.
I've been sick.

670
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,251
I need to see you.

671
00:55:40,753 --> 00:55:41,753
All right.

672
00:55:52,264 --> 00:55:53,766
Something's wrong, Jake.

673
00:55:53,766 --> 00:55:56,768
I don't know what it is,

674
00:55:56,768 --> 00:56:01,273
but I can't talk to anybody about it.

675
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:05,695
I mean, I figured I could talk to you.

676
00:56:06,195 --> 00:56:08,179
You always used to listen,

677
00:56:08,648 --> 00:56:10,148
you know.

678
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,125
I'm going to hell.

679
00:56:21,543 --> 00:56:24,547
That's as straight as I can put it.

680
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,048
And don't tell me that I'm crazy

681
00:56:27,048 --> 00:56:29,552
'cause I know I'm not.

682
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,052
They're coming after me.

683
00:56:34,056 --> 00:56:36,057
Who is?

684
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:39,561
They've been following me.

685
00:56:42,063 --> 00:56:44,567
They're coming out of the walls.

686
00:56:47,068 --> 00:56:49,554
I can't trust anybody.

687
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:57,079
But I got to talk to somebody.

688
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:59,581
I got to talk to somebody,

689
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:03,585
or I'm going to fly out
of my fucking mind!

690
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:08,340
Mind your business.

691
00:57:21,804 --> 00:57:24,306
I don't know who they are

692
00:57:24,306 --> 00:57:25,807
or what they are,

693
00:57:25,807 --> 00:57:27,809
but they're going to get me,

694
00:57:27,809 --> 00:57:29,811
and I'm scared, Jake.

695
00:57:29,811 --> 00:57:33,815
I'm so scared, I can't do anything.

696
00:57:33,815 --> 00:57:35,818
I can't go to my sister's.

697
00:57:35,818 --> 00:57:39,822
I can't even...

698
00:57:40,822 --> 00:57:42,824
I can't even go home.

699
00:57:42,824 --> 00:57:45,827
I don't know what to do.

700
00:57:45,827 --> 00:57:47,329
Paul?

701
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:49,831
Shit.

702
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:53,835
Paul, I know what you're talking about.

703
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:57,340
What do you mean?

704
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:01,760
I've seen them, too.

705
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,762
You've seen them?

706
00:58:03,762 --> 00:58:06,766
I've seen them, too...

707
00:58:06,766 --> 00:58:09,268
Everywhere, like a plague.

708
00:58:09,268 --> 00:58:12,271
My God, I thought I was the only one.

709
00:58:12,771 --> 00:58:13,773
Yeah, me, too.

710
00:58:13,773 --> 00:58:16,275
I thought I was going out of my mind.

711
00:58:16,275 --> 00:58:17,777
I know, I know.

712
00:58:17,777 --> 00:58:22,280
Look, I carry these around
everywhere with me,

713
00:58:22,782 --> 00:58:25,284
but they don't help.

714
00:58:25,784 --> 00:58:28,286
Nothing helps.

715
00:58:37,797 --> 00:58:38,797
What happened?

716
00:58:38,797 --> 00:58:41,300
What happened that night?

717
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,300


718
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,269


719
00:58:44,269 --> 00:58:46,271
What have they done to us?

720
00:58:46,271 --> 00:58:48,273
I don't know.

721
00:58:51,777 --> 00:58:53,278
Profile.

722
00:58:53,278 --> 00:58:55,780
Great. That's it.

723
00:58:55,898 --> 00:58:57,900
Give it to him.

724
00:59:24,809 --> 00:59:26,811
My lucky day.

725
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:48,583
Be advised, we have heavy gunfire...

726
00:59:50,202 --> 00:59:52,454
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

727
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:58,460
Five minutes to Da Nang.

728
01:01:51,155 --> 01:01:52,157
No, no.

729
01:01:52,657 --> 01:01:54,659
You have to be strong for your children.

730
01:01:54,659 --> 01:01:57,161
Listen to what she's saying.

731
01:01:59,164 --> 01:02:01,666
Did anybody see the police report?

732
01:02:01,666 --> 01:02:03,668
Sounds like a bomb to me.

733
01:02:03,918 --> 01:02:05,670
The paper said it was electrical.

734
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:07,172
It was an accident.

735
01:02:07,172 --> 01:02:08,172
That's bullshit.

736
01:02:08,172 --> 01:02:09,675
Someone's covering something up.

737
01:02:09,675 --> 01:02:12,677
That was no accident. It was set, man.

738
01:02:13,177 --> 01:02:17,181
Why? Paul wasn't hated
by anybody in the world.

739
01:02:17,181 --> 01:02:19,184
What about when you went out?

740
01:02:19,184 --> 01:02:20,686
Did he say anything?

741
01:02:23,188 --> 01:02:24,690
Well, he was upset.

742
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:27,192
He thought people were following him.

743
01:02:27,192 --> 01:02:28,693
Yeah? Who?

744
01:02:28,693 --> 01:02:30,695
He didn't know--

745
01:02:30,695 --> 01:02:32,197
Demons.

746
01:02:32,697 --> 01:02:36,702
Demons? What the fuck
you talking about, demons?

747
01:02:36,702 --> 01:02:39,704
He thought he was going to hell.

748
01:02:39,704 --> 01:02:41,706
Why did he say that?

749
01:02:41,706 --> 01:02:43,708
What would make him say that?

750
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:45,210
I mean, that's strange.

751
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:47,713
What else did he say, Jake?

752
01:02:47,713 --> 01:02:49,213
He was scared.

753
01:02:49,213 --> 01:02:50,715
He was seeing things

754
01:02:50,715 --> 01:02:52,351
Coming out of the woodwork.

755
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,853
"They're trying to get me," he said.

756
01:02:54,853 --> 01:02:58,222
Did he say what they were?

757
01:03:10,735 --> 01:03:11,987
Excuse me.

758
01:03:11,987 --> 01:03:15,490
In one end and out the other,
huh, George?

759
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:17,376
Still a fucking spaz.

760
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:19,994
Hope he can hold his dick

761
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:22,998
better than he can his bottle.

762
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:27,503
What?

763
01:03:39,014 --> 01:03:40,766
Something weird is going on here.

764
01:03:40,766 --> 01:03:43,268
Paul isn't the first one who's died.

765
01:03:43,268 --> 01:03:45,521
Remember Dr. Carlson over at Bellevue?

766
01:03:45,903 --> 01:03:46,905
His car blew up, too.

767
01:03:47,405 --> 01:03:49,407
Dr. Carlson's dead?

768
01:03:49,775 --> 01:03:52,277
Yeah. An explosion just like Paul's.

769
01:03:53,778 --> 01:03:55,780
We got six guys here
going fucking crazy.

770
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:57,282
Well, not me, buddy.

771
01:03:57,782 --> 01:04:00,284
Ok, but the rest of us are going crazy.

772
01:04:00,418 --> 01:04:02,920
Think this has something
to do with that night?

773
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,541
It's got something to do with something.

774
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:08,043
We have to go see the Army.

775
01:04:08,043 --> 01:04:10,045
They're not telling us something.

776
01:04:10,045 --> 01:04:11,679
Oh, come on, Professor.

777
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:13,681
What makes you think

778
01:04:13,681 --> 01:04:16,050
the Army's going to
give you any answers?

779
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:18,554
You'll be butting up
against a brick wall.

780
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:19,554
We'll get a lawyer.

781
01:04:20,054 --> 01:04:22,557
You should find yourself a shrink.

782
01:04:22,557 --> 01:04:24,559
You're all fucking paranoid.

783
01:04:25,059 --> 01:04:27,563
It was bad grass.
That's all it was, man.

784
01:04:27,695 --> 01:04:29,697
There's no such things
as fucking demons.

785
01:04:29,697 --> 01:04:31,199
Come on.

786
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:37,322
Carol, I'm going to
need you with your pad

787
01:04:37,822 --> 01:04:39,324
in about 15 minutes.

788
01:04:40,324 --> 01:04:43,327
Well, I'm sorry,

789
01:04:43,327 --> 01:04:45,329
Mr. Singer,

790
01:04:45,329 --> 01:04:48,833
but you know how many people come to me

791
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:50,835
with the injustices of the world?

792
01:04:50,835 --> 01:04:52,336
It would break your heart.

793
01:04:52,336 --> 01:04:54,590
Mr. Geary, this is very important to us.

794
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:57,092
The Army did something to us,

795
01:04:57,342 --> 01:04:59,344
and we've got to find out what.

796
01:04:59,344 --> 01:05:02,347
The Army? Jeez, what's with you guys?

797
01:05:02,347 --> 01:05:04,849
This is not a walk to the library.

798
01:05:04,849 --> 01:05:06,351
This is the U.S. government.

799
01:05:06,851 --> 01:05:08,853
This is red tape coming out your ass.

800
01:05:08,853 --> 01:05:10,239
You know what I mean?

801
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,739
That's why we're here.

802
01:05:11,739 --> 01:05:14,242
Do you think you can help us?

803
01:05:14,242 --> 01:05:17,746
What am I, Perry Mason?

804
01:05:29,257 --> 01:05:31,760
All right. I'll look into it.

805
01:05:33,762 --> 01:05:35,264
You think we have a chance?

806
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:38,266
I need sworn depositions
from all of you

807
01:05:38,766 --> 01:05:40,385
and a list of platoon members

808
01:05:40,385 --> 01:05:41,887
or their survivors.

809
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,271
This is great.

810
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:45,273
I'll tell you one thing.

811
01:05:45,273 --> 01:05:46,775
If we do find

812
01:05:46,775 --> 01:05:49,277
that the military is implicated in this,

813
01:05:49,277 --> 01:05:53,782
you all stand to make
quite a bit of money.

814
01:05:53,898 --> 01:05:55,900
Not that I can predict anything,

815
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,402
but class action suits of this kind

816
01:05:58,903 --> 01:06:00,905
have been awarded fairly
generous judgments.

817
01:06:01,405 --> 01:06:03,407
That wouldn't be so bad, would it?

818
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:06,911
We're not in it for the money.

819
01:06:06,911 --> 01:06:07,913
- That's right.
- Right.

820
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:13,418
All right, gentlemen,

821
01:06:13,418 --> 01:06:17,172
who wants to go first?

822
01:06:40,811 --> 01:06:43,699
I put a hungry man in the oven.

823
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:45,701
It will be ready at a quarter of.

824
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:46,702
Ok.

825
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:49,070
There's a tossed salad in the fridge.

826
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:50,706
Ok. Thanks.

827
01:06:50,956 --> 01:06:52,958
I got you some apple juice.

828
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:54,458
No, not Red Cheek.

829
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:55,710
Red Cheek.

830
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:56,711
Ah, shit.

831
01:06:56,961 --> 01:06:58,463
Don't drink it all.

832
01:06:58,579 --> 01:06:59,581
All right.

833
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:03,335
Oh, your lawyer called.

834
01:07:03,335 --> 01:07:05,336
When?

835
01:07:05,836 --> 01:07:07,338
When you were in the shower.

836
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:08,840
You didn't call me?

837
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,842
He didn't give me a chance.

838
01:07:10,842 --> 01:07:12,344
He hung up on me.

839
01:07:12,344 --> 01:07:15,347
Look, Jake, don't be upset, ok?

840
01:07:16,847 --> 01:07:19,351
He's not taking your case.

841
01:07:19,351 --> 01:07:20,851
What? What do you mean?

842
01:07:20,851 --> 01:07:23,855
He said you didn't have one.

843
01:07:23,855 --> 01:07:25,356
What's he talking about?

844
01:07:25,356 --> 01:07:27,858
I don't know. He was very rude.

845
01:07:27,858 --> 01:07:29,860
He said your friends backed out.

846
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:31,362
I don't believe this.

847
01:07:31,362 --> 01:07:33,998
Oh, baby, I feel terrible.

848
01:07:38,003 --> 01:07:40,755
I'd stay, but I'm so late.

849
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:44,009
We'll talk when I get home, ok?

850
01:07:44,009 --> 01:07:45,376
Yeah.

851
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,382
Are you all right?

852
01:07:51,382 --> 01:07:53,385
Yeah, I'm fine.

853
01:07:53,385 --> 01:07:55,387
You sure?

854
01:07:55,887 --> 01:07:57,889
Give me a kiss.

855
01:08:01,525 --> 01:08:03,027
I'll see you later.

856
01:08:03,027 --> 01:08:04,528
Bye, sweetheart.

857
01:08:15,657 --> 01:08:17,658


858
01:08:23,164 --> 01:08:24,166
Hello?

859
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:25,667
Frank, hi. It's Jake.

860
01:08:26,167 --> 01:08:28,170
I just got a strange call from Geary.

861
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:30,671
He said the guys backed down.

862
01:08:30,671 --> 01:08:32,173
What's he talking about?

863
01:08:32,673 --> 01:08:33,175
Uh...

864
01:08:33,675 --> 01:08:36,677
Yeah, that's right, Jake, we did.

865
01:08:36,927 --> 01:08:38,930
Why?

866
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:41,817
I don't know. It's hard to explain.

867
01:08:42,317 --> 01:08:43,935


868
01:08:43,935 --> 01:08:46,070
Well, try.

869
01:08:48,073 --> 01:08:49,573
You know, Jake, um...

870
01:08:51,576 --> 01:08:52,577
War's war.

871
01:08:52,577 --> 01:08:54,078
Things happen.

872
01:08:54,578 --> 01:08:55,579
Things happen?

873
01:08:56,081 --> 01:08:59,583
What does that mean?

874
01:08:59,583 --> 01:09:02,587
I thought we were going
to do something, Frank.

875
01:09:02,587 --> 01:09:05,039
There's nothing to do, Jake.

876
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:07,958
Who's been talking to you?

877
01:09:10,462 --> 01:09:12,963
What's going on, Frank?

878
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:19,854
I'll call the others.

879
01:09:19,854 --> 01:09:20,855
They're not interested, Jake.

880
01:09:20,855 --> 01:09:22,356
What do you mean?

881
01:09:22,356 --> 01:09:23,859
They're not interested.

882
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,860
We all talked about this.

883
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:28,363
We're all suffering the same symptoms.

884
01:09:28,363 --> 01:09:30,865
Listen, the Army's hiding
something from us.

885
01:09:30,865 --> 01:09:33,868
We got to find out what it is.

886
01:09:33,868 --> 01:09:36,121
Uh, Jake, I got to go.

887
01:09:36,121 --> 01:09:37,872
No, no, no, wait. Hold on.

888
01:09:37,872 --> 01:09:39,875
No, wait. Don't hang up.

889
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:42,243
Jake, don't call back anymore, ok?

890
01:09:42,243 --> 01:09:44,746
Wait! I can't do this by myself.

891
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:46,247
Frank?

892
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:51,752
Frank?

893
01:10:14,493 --> 01:10:16,494
We'll get them this afternoon.

894
01:10:16,494 --> 01:10:17,996
Have a good lunch.

895
01:10:17,996 --> 01:10:19,613
Geary.

896
01:10:19,613 --> 01:10:20,364
Mr. Geary.

897
01:10:20,364 --> 01:10:22,367
Excuse me.

898
01:10:23,868 --> 01:10:25,871
Who's been talking to you, huh?

899
01:10:25,871 --> 01:10:26,872
The Army?

900
01:10:26,872 --> 01:10:28,873
Have they been talking to you?

901
01:10:28,873 --> 01:10:30,375
Nobody's talking to nobody.

902
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:32,377
You don't have a case.

903
01:10:32,377 --> 01:10:33,878
Keep your hands off me.

904
01:10:33,878 --> 01:10:35,380
Leave me alone.

905
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:37,265
You can't walk away like this.

906
01:10:37,765 --> 01:10:39,768
We need your help.

907
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:40,769
You need a doctor.

908
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:42,770
The Army did something to me.

909
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:44,271
I got to prove it.

910
01:10:44,271 --> 01:10:46,774
There's nothing I can do, all right?

911
01:10:46,774 --> 01:10:47,775
Just leave me alone.

912
01:10:47,775 --> 01:10:49,277
Something's going on here.

913
01:10:49,277 --> 01:10:50,779
You're not telling me something.

914
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:52,530
What's wrong with you?

915
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:54,533
I'll tell you what's wrong.

916
01:10:54,533 --> 01:10:56,534
I don't know you from Adam.

917
01:10:56,902 --> 01:10:58,403
You walk in with some bizarre-o story

918
01:10:58,904 --> 01:11:00,905
and demand I check it out. I did.

919
01:11:01,405 --> 01:11:04,408
I don't know what you take me for,

920
01:11:04,909 --> 01:11:05,911
but you've used me.

921
01:11:05,911 --> 01:11:06,912
Used you?

922
01:11:06,912 --> 01:11:08,796
I checked with the Army.

923
01:11:08,796 --> 01:11:11,550
You never even went to Vietnam.

924
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:13,051
What's that supposed to mean?

925
01:11:13,051 --> 01:11:15,052
You and your friends are wacko!

926
01:11:15,052 --> 01:11:17,555
You were all discharged
on psychological grounds

927
01:11:17,555 --> 01:11:19,557
after some war games in Thailand.

928
01:11:19,557 --> 01:11:21,560
Don't you see what they're doing?

929
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,563
We were in Da Nang.
You got to believe me.

930
01:11:25,063 --> 01:11:26,564
Go fuck yourself, Singer.

931
01:11:44,949 --> 01:11:47,836
Hey!

932
01:11:49,337 --> 01:11:50,588
What is this?

933
01:11:50,588 --> 01:11:52,090
What is this?

934
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:53,091
Help!

935
01:11:53,091 --> 01:11:54,592
Help!

936
01:11:56,344 --> 01:11:58,846
Come on, get in there, you cocksucker.

937
01:11:59,346 --> 01:12:01,966
Get off of me!

938
01:12:13,728 --> 01:12:15,729
You little fuck!

939
01:12:15,729 --> 01:12:17,481
Mr. Singer.

940
01:12:17,731 --> 01:12:18,733
What an appropriate name

941
01:12:18,733 --> 01:12:20,734
for someone who can't
keep his mouth shut.

942
01:12:21,235 --> 01:12:24,238
Who are you? What do you want?

943
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:28,376
We've been watching you
for a long time--

944
01:12:28,376 --> 01:12:29,877
you and your friends--

945
01:12:29,877 --> 01:12:31,880
Frightening people with foolish talk

946
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,881
about the Army and experiments.

947
01:12:33,881 --> 01:12:36,384
You're in over your head, Mr. Singer.

948
01:12:36,384 --> 01:12:38,136
Men drown that way.

949
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:45,010
The Army was part of another life.

950
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:47,011
Let it lie.

951
01:12:47,011 --> 01:12:49,898
I hope we've made our point, Mr. Singer.

952
01:13:01,275 --> 01:13:03,028
Kill this motherfucker!

953
01:13:18,792 --> 01:13:20,427
Help!

954
01:13:39,698 --> 01:13:40,698
Look out!

955
01:13:42,199 --> 01:13:42,817


956
01:13:42,817 --> 01:13:44,819
Please give a little something

957
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:47,822
to help the poor families.

958
01:14:06,841 --> 01:14:09,094
You poor, poor man.

959
01:14:17,985 --> 01:14:20,354


960
01:14:20,354 --> 01:14:24,458
Merry, merry Christmas!

961
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:31,832
This guy's really hurt.

962
01:14:31,832 --> 01:14:33,835
You better get something in him.

963
01:14:33,835 --> 01:14:35,203
Hi, I'm Dr. Stewart.

964
01:14:35,703 --> 01:14:37,706
Can you tell me what happened?

965
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:38,707
My back.

966
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:40,708
I--I can't move.

967
01:14:41,091 --> 01:14:42,092
Get my chiropractor.

968
01:14:42,594 --> 01:14:44,595
Your back?

969
01:14:44,595 --> 01:14:46,347
Did you fall?

970
01:14:46,347 --> 01:14:48,850
He said he slipped on the pavement.

971
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:50,851
He may have hit his head.

972
01:14:50,851 --> 01:14:53,104
Does he have any identification?

973
01:14:53,104 --> 01:14:54,355
No wallet, nothing.

974
01:14:54,722 --> 01:14:55,724
He stole it.

975
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:57,108
Who did?

976
01:14:57,609 --> 01:14:59,109
Santa Claus.

977
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:03,731
I got to get the bastard.

978
01:15:06,234 --> 01:15:09,237
It had my son's picture in it--

979
01:15:09,237 --> 01:15:10,238
Gabe's picture.

980
01:15:10,738 --> 01:15:12,740
It's the only one I had.

981
01:15:12,873 --> 01:15:15,243
Get an orthopedic man in here.
Is Dr. Davis on call?

982
01:15:15,243 --> 01:15:16,994
I'll page him.

983
01:15:19,497 --> 01:15:20,998
Call my chiropractor.

984
01:15:20,998 --> 01:15:23,001
We're doing everything we can.

985
01:15:25,002 --> 01:15:26,003
Louie Denardo,

986
01:15:26,003 --> 01:15:27,505
Nostend avenue.

987
01:15:35,145 --> 01:15:37,649
I'll have to move you
to check for injuries.

988
01:15:37,649 --> 01:15:38,649
No, doctor.

989
01:15:38,649 --> 01:15:40,652
This may hurt a little.

990
01:15:40,652 --> 01:15:41,653
No, no--aah!

991
01:15:43,654 --> 01:15:46,658
I don't have to ask if
you could feel that.

992
01:15:46,658 --> 01:15:48,158
God damn it. I need Louie.

993
01:15:48,659 --> 01:15:49,661
Who's Louie?

994
01:15:50,662 --> 01:15:52,162
He's out of it.

995
01:15:52,162 --> 01:15:54,164
Let's take him down to X-ray.

996
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:34,122
Gabe?

997
01:18:34,074 --> 01:18:35,693
Jezzie...

998
01:18:37,194 --> 01:18:38,947
Get me out of here.

999
01:18:39,447 --> 01:18:40,948
Where do you want to go?

1000
01:18:40,948 --> 01:18:41,832
Home.

1001
01:18:42,332 --> 01:18:43,333
Home?

1002
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:45,336
This is your home. You're dead.

1003
01:18:45,336 --> 01:18:46,337
Dead?

1004
01:18:46,837 --> 01:18:50,841
No. No, I just hurt my back.

1005
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:52,460
I'm not dead.

1006
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:53,461
What are you, then?

1007
01:18:53,461 --> 01:18:54,962
I'm alive!

1008
01:18:54,962 --> 01:18:55,963
Then what you doing here?

1009
01:18:56,346 --> 01:18:58,349
I don't know.

1010
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:01,853
This isn't happening.

1011
01:19:01,853 --> 01:19:03,104
What is happening?

1012
01:19:03,104 --> 01:19:05,606
Get me out of here.

1013
01:19:05,606 --> 01:19:07,609
There is no out of here.

1014
01:19:08,109 --> 01:19:09,109
You've been killed.

1015
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:11,613
Don't you remember?

1016
01:19:15,115 --> 01:19:17,484


1017
01:19:17,484 --> 01:19:18,368
Careful.

1018
01:19:18,869 --> 01:19:19,871
We're losing him!

1019
01:19:20,371 --> 01:19:21,372
We're losing him!

1020
01:19:21,372 --> 01:19:22,873
Watch it! Careful.

1021
01:19:22,873 --> 01:19:24,375
What the fuck's taking them--

1022
01:19:24,859 --> 01:19:26,077
He's still pretty doped up.

1023
01:19:26,077 --> 01:19:29,079
I don't think he'll
be able to talk yet.

1024
01:19:29,079 --> 01:19:31,082
I doubt he'll recognize you.

1025
01:19:34,335 --> 01:19:35,837
I just want to see him.

1026
01:19:36,337 --> 01:19:38,338
I'll be outside if you need me.

1027
01:19:40,341 --> 01:19:41,341
Dad?

1028
01:19:41,842 --> 01:19:43,344
Hi.

1029
01:19:44,595 --> 01:19:45,595
It's us.

1030
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:50,851
You ok?

1031
01:19:51,351 --> 01:19:52,353
Jake,

1032
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:54,354
it's me.

1033
01:19:55,856 --> 01:19:57,358
We heard what happened.

1034
01:20:09,369 --> 01:20:10,872
I'm not dead.

1035
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:12,873
What?

1036
01:20:12,873 --> 01:20:15,376
I'm alive.

1037
01:20:16,877 --> 01:20:19,380
I'm not dead.

1038
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:21,381
Oh. Oh, no.

1039
01:20:21,882 --> 01:20:23,384
Of course you're not.

1040
01:20:23,384 --> 01:20:26,386
You just hurt your back, that's all.

1041
01:20:26,386 --> 01:20:29,390
It'll be fine. It just takes some time.

1042
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:31,391
A month they said.

1043
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:34,895
Just hang in there, dad.

1044
01:20:34,895 --> 01:20:36,898


1045
01:20:36,898 --> 01:20:38,399
Now stop it.

1046
01:20:38,899 --> 01:20:39,900
It's not funny.

1047
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:42,904
God.

1048
01:20:44,404 --> 01:20:45,907
What a mess, huh?

1049
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:51,912
Oh, Jacob.

1050
01:20:51,912 --> 01:20:53,914
I still love you.

1051
01:20:56,417 --> 01:20:58,418
For whatever that's worth.

1052
01:21:02,422 --> 01:21:04,307
Dream on.

1053
01:21:05,309 --> 01:21:06,310
Oh, God, no!

1054
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:07,811
What?

1055
01:21:07,811 --> 01:21:09,313
What?

1056
01:21:13,818 --> 01:21:15,319
Oh, god, what?

1057
01:21:15,319 --> 01:21:17,320
Tell me, what can I do?

1058
01:21:19,323 --> 01:21:20,824
Help me.

1059
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,333
Hold on.

1060
01:21:34,087 --> 01:21:35,088
Jacob?

1061
01:21:35,088 --> 01:21:36,090
Shh.

1062
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:37,591
Jacob Singer!

1063
01:21:37,841 --> 01:21:38,842
Shh!

1064
01:21:38,842 --> 01:21:39,342
Jacob!

1065
01:21:39,844 --> 01:21:41,345
Sir, keep your voice down.

1066
01:21:41,845 --> 01:21:43,847
Where's Jacob Singer?

1067
01:21:43,847 --> 01:21:45,349
Louie, I'm in here!

1068
01:21:45,349 --> 01:21:47,851
Jake? Where are you, Jake?

1069
01:21:47,851 --> 01:21:49,103
You can't go in there.

1070
01:21:49,103 --> 01:21:50,604
Can I help you?

1071
01:21:50,604 --> 01:21:51,354
Jacob!

1072
01:21:51,354 --> 01:21:54,358
Good god, Jake, what have they done?

1073
01:21:54,358 --> 01:21:55,976
Can I help you?

1074
01:21:55,976 --> 01:21:57,478
You can't go in there.

1075
01:21:57,478 --> 01:21:59,363
What is this, the Middle Ages?

1076
01:21:59,363 --> 01:22:00,981
Don't touch him!

1077
01:22:00,981 --> 01:22:02,483
They call this modern medicine?

1078
01:22:02,483 --> 01:22:04,484
This is barbaric. Barbaric!

1079
01:22:04,484 --> 01:22:06,237
All right, just calm down.

1080
01:22:06,737 --> 01:22:09,372
Why don't you just burn
him at the stake?

1081
01:22:09,873 --> 01:22:10,875
You'll have to leave!

1082
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:13,627
Stay back! Don't come near me!

1083
01:22:13,743 --> 01:22:14,244
Stay back!

1084
01:22:14,744 --> 01:22:15,746
Take one step

1085
01:22:16,247 --> 01:22:18,248
And I'll wrap this around your neck.

1086
01:22:18,498 --> 01:22:19,500
Calm down.

1087
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,384
Back! Back!

1088
01:22:20,885 --> 01:22:22,136
Calm down.

1089
01:22:23,637 --> 01:22:24,639
Come on, Jake.

1090
01:22:25,139 --> 01:22:26,640
Come on.

1091
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,141
You can't do that.

1092
01:22:33,264 --> 01:22:34,765
Make sure that security's alerted.

1093
01:22:38,769 --> 01:22:39,904
You can't do this!

1094
01:22:40,404 --> 01:22:41,905
Out of the way!

1095
01:22:41,905 --> 01:22:43,908
I'm upset.

1096
01:22:43,908 --> 01:22:46,159
I'm really upset.

1097
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:48,162
That's a crazy man.

1098
01:22:48,162 --> 01:22:49,663
That man is crazy.

1099
01:22:49,663 --> 01:22:52,166
Watch your toes, Jake.

1100
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:03,677
Well, you've done it
to yourself this time,

1101
01:23:03,677 --> 01:23:05,179
haven't you?

1102
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:09,182
Am I dying, Louie?

1103
01:23:09,182 --> 01:23:11,685
From a slipped disk?

1104
01:23:12,185 --> 01:23:14,188
That would be a first.

1105
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:18,192
I was in hell.

1106
01:23:20,194 --> 01:23:22,195
I don't want to die, Louie.

1107
01:23:22,195 --> 01:23:25,699
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.

1108
01:23:28,202 --> 01:23:29,703
It's all pain.

1109
01:23:32,206 --> 01:23:33,707
Straighten out your head.

1110
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:37,962
Relax.

1111
01:23:39,462 --> 01:23:41,966
You ever read Meister Eckhart?

1112
01:23:41,966 --> 01:23:43,967
No.

1113
01:23:43,967 --> 01:23:46,970
How did you get your doctorate
without reading Eckhart?

1114
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:48,221
Relax.

1115
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:52,225
Ok, good. Now turn over gently--

1116
01:23:52,225 --> 01:23:53,728
right side.

1117
01:23:56,229 --> 01:23:57,230
The other right, ok?

1118
01:23:57,731 --> 01:24:01,735
You're a regular basket
case, you know that?

1119
01:24:07,608 --> 01:24:10,610
Eckhart saw hell, too.

1120
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:12,613
You know what he said?

1121
01:24:12,613 --> 01:24:15,615
He said the only thing
that burns in hell

1122
01:24:15,615 --> 01:24:17,118
is the part of you

1123
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:19,619
that won't let go of your life--

1124
01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:21,122
your memories, your attachments.

1125
01:24:21,122 --> 01:24:23,123
They burn them all away.

1126
01:24:23,123 --> 01:24:26,127
But they're not punishing you, he said.

1127
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:28,128
They're freeing your soul.

1128
01:24:28,128 --> 01:24:29,130
Relax.

1129
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,131


1130
01:24:31,131 --> 01:24:32,632
Good.

1131
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:41,141
So the way he sees it...

1132
01:24:41,141 --> 01:24:45,145
if you're frightened of dying
and you're holding on...

1133
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:50,150
you'll see devils tearing
your life away.

1134
01:24:50,150 --> 01:24:53,654
But if you've made your peace,

1135
01:24:53,654 --> 01:24:55,989
then the devils are really angels

1136
01:24:55,989 --> 01:24:57,992
freeing you from the earth.

1137
01:24:57,992 --> 01:25:02,997
It's just a matter of how
you look at it, that's all.

1138
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:04,998
So don't worry, ok?

1139
01:25:05,498 --> 01:25:07,001
Ok?

1140
01:25:10,003 --> 01:25:11,005
Good.

1141
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:12,006
Relax.

1142
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:13,506
Relax.

1143
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:18,011
Relax...

1144
01:25:18,011 --> 01:25:20,014
And wiggle your toes.

1145
01:25:21,515 --> 01:25:24,018
Come on, wiggle your toes.

1146
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:28,021
Perfect.

1147
01:25:28,021 --> 01:25:29,523
We got it.

1148
01:25:31,024 --> 01:25:32,525
We got it.

1149
01:25:32,659 --> 01:25:34,161
Get on your back. Come on.

1150
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:35,662
Easy.

1151
01:25:35,662 --> 01:25:37,163
Ok?

1152
01:25:37,414 --> 01:25:39,417
Now let's just give it a little try.

1153
01:25:39,417 --> 01:25:42,420
I want to see if you can stand.

1154
01:25:47,925 --> 01:25:49,426
By myself?

1155
01:25:50,427 --> 01:25:52,430
You can do it.

1156
01:25:54,431 --> 01:25:55,932
Come on.

1157
01:25:57,435 --> 01:25:59,936
Just give it a try, Jacob.

1158
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,938
Come on.

1159
01:26:04,442 --> 01:26:05,943
Come on.

1160
01:26:07,944 --> 01:26:10,948
Attaboy. Go ahead.

1161
01:26:11,948 --> 01:26:13,451
Go ahead.

1162
01:26:14,952 --> 01:26:16,453
Go ahead.

1163
01:26:23,577 --> 01:26:25,578
Hallelujah.

1164
01:29:29,395 --> 01:29:31,649


1165
01:30:31,574 --> 01:30:33,577
Jake?

1166
01:30:33,577 --> 01:30:35,078
What's wrong?

1167
01:30:35,578 --> 01:30:36,579
It's me.

1168
01:30:39,082 --> 01:30:40,583
Are you ok?

1169
01:30:42,586 --> 01:30:45,088
Jesus Christ, where have you been?

1170
01:30:45,088 --> 01:30:46,590
I've been worried sick.

1171
01:30:47,091 --> 01:30:50,094
I mean, it's two days,
and you don't call me?

1172
01:30:50,094 --> 01:30:52,095
I was in the hospital.

1173
01:30:53,596 --> 01:30:55,599
Oh, Jesus. In the hospital?

1174
01:30:58,101 --> 01:30:59,603
Jake, honey, what hospital?

1175
01:31:00,104 --> 01:31:02,605
I called every hospital in the city.

1176
01:31:02,605 --> 01:31:04,608


1177
01:31:06,609 --> 01:31:07,610
No, don't.

1178
01:31:07,610 --> 01:31:08,612


1179
01:31:08,612 --> 01:31:10,113
What's going on?

1180
01:31:10,113 --> 01:31:12,865
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.

1181
01:31:12,865 --> 01:31:15,368


1182
01:31:15,368 --> 01:31:16,369
Hello?

1183
01:31:16,369 --> 01:31:17,871
Is Jacob Singer there?

1184
01:31:17,871 --> 01:31:19,872
No. I haven't seen him all night.

1185
01:31:20,373 --> 01:31:21,375
When do you expect him?

1186
01:31:21,375 --> 01:31:22,376
I don't know.

1187
01:31:22,876 --> 01:31:24,377
Could you tell him something?

1188
01:31:24,377 --> 01:31:25,878
Tell him I was in Vietnam--

1189
01:31:25,878 --> 01:31:26,880
Vietnam?

1190
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,381
There was a secret experiment--

1191
01:31:28,381 --> 01:31:29,382
What experiment?

1192
01:31:29,382 --> 01:31:31,885
I need to see him as soon as possible.

1193
01:31:31,885 --> 01:31:33,386
Hello. This is Jacob Singer.

1194
01:31:33,386 --> 01:31:35,389
I was in-country in '68.

1195
01:31:35,389 --> 01:31:37,890
I was in a chemical
warfare unit in Saigon.

1196
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:39,893
We conducted secret
government experiments.

1197
01:31:39,893 --> 01:31:40,894
My God.

1198
01:31:40,894 --> 01:31:41,895
Are you there?

1199
01:31:41,895 --> 01:31:42,895
Yeah.

1200
01:31:42,895 --> 01:31:43,896
Do you want to know more?

1201
01:31:44,398 --> 01:31:45,899
Where can I meet you?

1202
01:31:45,899 --> 01:31:46,899
On 128th and westside highway

1203
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:48,402
in front of a coffee truck.

1204
01:31:48,402 --> 01:31:49,903
How will I know you?

1205
01:31:49,903 --> 01:31:51,404
You already know me.

1206
01:31:51,404 --> 01:31:52,405
I do?

1207
01:31:52,405 --> 01:31:54,408
Yes. Make sure you're not followed, ok?

1208
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:56,909
All right. Bye.

1209
01:31:56,909 --> 01:31:58,662
I knew it.

1210
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:04,167
Who was that?

1211
01:32:04,167 --> 01:32:05,668
A chemist.

1212
01:32:07,671 --> 01:32:11,675
Part of a chemical warfare
unit out of Saigon.

1213
01:32:12,176 --> 01:32:14,177
I knew something was going on.

1214
01:32:14,677 --> 01:32:17,180
Jake... please don't go.

1215
01:32:26,689 --> 01:32:28,192
Oh, I'm sorry.

1216
01:32:44,841 --> 01:32:46,210
Jacob?

1217
01:32:47,211 --> 01:32:49,462
Hi. I'm Michael Newman.

1218
01:32:52,349 --> 01:32:53,350
Yeah.

1219
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,601
I told you you'd know me.

1220
01:32:55,601 --> 01:32:58,104
I've been tracking you for a long time.

1221
01:32:58,104 --> 01:33:00,606
I wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.

1222
01:33:00,606 --> 01:33:02,109
Why are you following me?

1223
01:33:02,475 --> 01:33:04,978
You're one of the survivors, Jacob.

1224
01:33:08,865 --> 01:33:09,983
Come on. We can't talk here.

1225
01:33:09,983 --> 01:33:12,235
It's not safe. Come on.

1226
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:19,493
So, first I'm arrested, right?

1227
01:33:19,993 --> 01:33:22,996
Best LSD I ever made
right down the drain.

1228
01:33:23,497 --> 01:33:24,997
I figured, "This is it.

1229
01:33:25,498 --> 01:33:27,501
20 years in the can if I'm lucky."

1230
01:33:28,001 --> 01:33:29,002
That was 1968.

1231
01:33:29,502 --> 01:33:30,503
Long time ago.

1232
01:33:30,503 --> 01:33:33,506
Really. Next thing I know,
I'm on Riker's island.

1233
01:33:33,506 --> 01:33:35,641
Ever been there, man?

1234
01:33:35,641 --> 01:33:38,145
Well, suddenly, they
take me from my cell,

1235
01:33:38,145 --> 01:33:42,149
they throw me in a waiting room
With bank teller windows.

1236
01:33:42,649 --> 01:33:45,152
Four army colonels with
medals up their asses

1237
01:33:45,652 --> 01:33:46,653
are standing on the other side.

1238
01:33:46,653 --> 01:33:50,657
They say to me, if I come
to Vietnam for two years--

1239
01:33:51,158 --> 01:33:52,658
No action, just work in a lab--

1240
01:33:53,159 --> 01:33:55,662
they'll drop all charges
and wipe the record clean.

1241
01:33:55,662 --> 01:33:57,663
I'd only been in jail 13 hours.

1242
01:33:57,663 --> 01:33:59,666
I knew 'Nam couldn't be any worse.

1243
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:01,167
Shows how little you knew.

1244
01:34:01,667 --> 01:34:04,171
Yeah, really. They had me by the balls.

1245
01:34:04,671 --> 01:34:06,172
Next thing I know, I'm in Saigon.

1246
01:34:06,539 --> 01:34:09,042
I'm working in a top-secret lab

1247
01:34:09,042 --> 01:34:11,043
synthesizing mind-altering drugs.

1248
01:34:11,545 --> 01:34:12,546
Not the street stuff.

1249
01:34:13,046 --> 01:34:15,047
They had us isolating
special properties--

1250
01:34:15,047 --> 01:34:16,550
the dark side.

1251
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:21,054
They wanted a drug that increased
aggressive tendencies.

1252
01:34:21,054 --> 01:34:23,055
They were scared. They were worried.

1253
01:34:23,055 --> 01:34:25,057
They figured you guys were too soft,

1254
01:34:25,057 --> 01:34:26,560
not fighting up to your potential.

1255
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,561
They wanted something to stir you up,

1256
01:34:28,561 --> 01:34:32,565
make you mad, you know,
tap into your anger.

1257
01:34:32,565 --> 01:34:34,568
And we did it.

1258
01:34:34,568 --> 01:34:37,069
Most powerful thing I ever saw.

1259
01:34:37,069 --> 01:34:40,573
Even a bad trip, and believe
me, I've had my share,

1260
01:34:40,573 --> 01:34:43,577
do not compare to the
fury of the Ladder.

1261
01:34:43,577 --> 01:34:44,578
The Ladder?

1262
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:47,079
Yeah. That's what they called it.

1263
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:50,082
A fast trip straight down the Ladder--

1264
01:34:50,082 --> 01:34:53,587
right to the primal fear,
right to the base anger.

1265
01:34:53,587 --> 01:34:56,088
I'm telling you, man, it was powerful.

1266
01:34:56,088 --> 01:34:59,592
I don't need to tell you.
You already know.

1267
01:34:59,592 --> 01:35:02,595
We did experiments on jungle monkeys.

1268
01:35:02,595 --> 01:35:04,096
It worked.

1269
01:35:04,096 --> 01:35:06,600
They bashed each other's heads in,

1270
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,101
gouged out their eyes,
chewed off their tails.

1271
01:35:09,101 --> 01:35:10,604
The brass loved it.

1272
01:35:10,604 --> 01:35:13,606
Then they made us try it on charlie.

1273
01:35:20,497 --> 01:35:23,500
We, uh...

1274
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:26,502
took these POWs, you know?

1275
01:35:26,502 --> 01:35:29,006
Just kids, really.

1276
01:35:29,006 --> 01:35:33,510
And... we put them in this courtyard,

1277
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:37,014
And we fed them huge
doses of the stuff.

1278
01:35:39,015 --> 01:35:42,019
I mean, they were worse
than the monkeys.

1279
01:35:42,019 --> 01:35:45,021
I didn't know men could do those things.

1280
01:35:49,025 --> 01:35:52,529
Anyway, there was this big
offensive coming up, right?

1281
01:35:52,529 --> 01:35:54,530
Everyone knew it--

1282
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:56,033
Time Magazine, Huntley, Brinkley--

1283
01:35:56,033 --> 01:35:57,533
And the brass were scared

1284
01:35:57,533 --> 01:35:59,036
because they knew we couldn't win.

1285
01:35:59,036 --> 01:36:02,038
Morale was down, it was
getting ugly in the States.

1286
01:36:02,038 --> 01:36:03,039
You remember.

1287
01:36:03,039 --> 01:36:04,541
Yeah.

1288
01:36:04,541 --> 01:36:06,542
So, a couple days later,

1289
01:36:06,542 --> 01:36:09,546
they decide to use the Ladder...

1290
01:36:09,546 --> 01:36:12,048
on one test battalion...

1291
01:36:12,466 --> 01:36:13,466
Yours.

1292
01:36:13,466 --> 01:36:17,470
Just an infinitesimal dose in
the food supply, they said,

1293
01:36:17,470 --> 01:36:20,474
just to prove its effectiveness
in the field.

1294
01:36:20,474 --> 01:36:23,476
They were sure your unit would
have the highest kill ratio

1295
01:36:23,926 --> 01:36:24,927
in the whole God damn offensive,

1296
01:36:25,429 --> 01:36:26,430
and they were right--
you did--

1297
01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:28,931
except not the way they thought.

1298
01:36:32,435 --> 01:36:34,938
No one can remember that night.

1299
01:36:34,938 --> 01:36:38,442
I get flashes, but
they don't make sense.

1300
01:36:38,442 --> 01:36:39,960
What happened?

1301
01:36:40,193 --> 01:36:42,194
Was there an offensive?

1302
01:36:42,194 --> 01:36:46,198
Yeah, a couple days later.
It was fierce,

1303
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:48,201
but you guys never saw it.

1304
01:36:48,335 --> 01:36:49,836
But there was an attack?

1305
01:36:49,836 --> 01:36:51,837
It was a fight, right?

1306
01:36:51,954 --> 01:36:54,925
Yeah, but not with the Cong.

1307
01:36:59,128 --> 01:37:00,130
With who?

1308
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:11,024
You killed each other.

1309
01:37:12,525 --> 01:37:14,144
What?

1310
01:37:14,144 --> 01:37:16,645
It was brother against brother.

1311
01:37:16,645 --> 01:37:19,149
No discrimination.

1312
01:37:19,149 --> 01:37:21,150
You tore each other to pieces.

1313
01:37:21,534 --> 01:37:23,286
My God.

1314
01:37:23,286 --> 01:37:26,288
I knew it would happen.

1315
01:37:26,288 --> 01:37:27,791
I warned them.

1316
01:37:27,791 --> 01:37:30,292
I fucking warned them!

1317
01:37:33,046 --> 01:37:35,047
Ohh, fuck.

1318
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,561
I was just some hippie chemist, right?

1319
01:37:48,561 --> 01:37:50,564
What did I know?

1320
01:37:51,564 --> 01:37:53,065
Fuck.

1321
01:37:54,067 --> 01:37:57,069
I talked to the guys
who bagged the bodies.

1322
01:37:57,069 --> 01:38:00,573
They were in worse shape
than you, believe me.

1323
01:38:00,573 --> 01:38:03,076
They saw what was left.

1324
01:38:08,582 --> 01:38:12,586
I needed to find you, you know?

1325
01:38:12,586 --> 01:38:15,087
I felt responsible.

1326
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:19,509
The Ladder was my baby.

1327
01:38:56,296 --> 01:38:57,797
I'm going to Brooklyn.

1328
01:38:57,797 --> 01:38:59,800
Not with me, you're not.

1329
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,551
I get lost in Brooklyn.

1330
01:39:02,551 --> 01:39:04,054
I know the way.

1331
01:39:04,054 --> 01:39:05,555
Listen...

1332
01:39:05,555 --> 01:39:09,309
This is all the money I have.

1333
01:39:09,676 --> 01:39:11,177
Take me home, please.

1334
01:39:11,177 --> 01:39:13,814
Where's your home?

1335
01:40:54,530 --> 01:40:55,532
Dr. Singer.

1336
01:40:56,032 --> 01:40:59,536
Well... it's been a long time.

1337
01:40:59,536 --> 01:41:00,537
Hello, sam.

1338
01:41:01,037 --> 01:41:03,038
Are you all right?

1339
01:41:03,038 --> 01:41:05,175
Yeah, I'm ok.

1340
01:41:05,175 --> 01:41:08,795
Do you want some help?
I can call upstairs.

1341
01:41:08,795 --> 01:41:11,297
No, no. That's ok.

1342
01:41:11,297 --> 01:41:13,182
Thanks, sam.

1343
01:41:51,037 --> 01:41:52,538
Sarah?

1344
01:42:11,056 --> 01:42:13,059
Jed?

1345
01:42:13,059 --> 01:42:14,560
Eli?

1346
01:43:37,726 --> 01:43:39,729
If you're frightened of dying

1347
01:43:39,729 --> 01:43:41,230
and you're holding on,

1348
01:43:41,230 --> 01:43:45,734
you'll see devils
tearing your life away.

1349
01:43:45,734 --> 01:43:48,238
If you've made your peace,

1350
01:43:48,238 --> 01:43:50,289
then the devils are really angels

1351
01:43:50,789 --> 01:43:53,426
freeing you from the earth.

1352
01:44:30,529 --> 01:44:35,534


1353
01:44:38,037 --> 01:44:42,542


1354
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,904


1355
01:45:13,655 --> 01:45:15,158
Gabe?

1356
01:45:23,882 --> 01:45:25,752
Gabe?

1357
01:45:26,752 --> 01:45:28,253
Hi, Dad.

1358
01:45:49,274 --> 01:45:51,277
It's ok.

1359
01:46:01,787 --> 01:46:03,789
Come on.
Let's go up.

1360
01:46:12,297 --> 01:46:13,800
Come on.

1361
01:46:52,387 --> 01:46:53,890
He's gone.

1362
01:47:01,396 --> 01:47:05,400
He looks kind of peaceful, the guy.

1363
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:08,404
Put up a hell of a fight, though.

1364
01:47:13,909 --> 01:47:15,411
What's the guy's name?

1365
01:47:17,412 --> 01:47:20,416
Singer. Jacob singer.

1366
01:47:31,426 --> 01:47:37,432
I don't mind the gray skies 

1367
01:47:37,432 --> 01:47:39,935
You make them blue 

1368
01:47:39,935 --> 01:47:44,524
Sonny boy 

1369
01:47:45,123 --> 01:47:49,311
Friends may forsake me 

1370
01:47:49,311 --> 01:47:53,315
Let them all forsake me 

1371
01:47:53,315 --> 01:47:56,452
I still have you 

1372
01:47:56,452 --> 01:47:59,872
Sonny boy 

1373
01:48:01,373 --> 01:48:05,094
You're sent from heaven 

1374
01:48:05,094 --> 01:48:08,715
And I know your worth 

1375
01:48:08,715 --> 01:48:19,725
You made a heaven for me here on earth 

1376
01:48:19,725 --> 01:48:24,229
When I'm old and gray here 

1377
01:48:24,229 --> 01:48:28,234
Promise you won't stray, dear 

1378
01:48:28,234 --> 01:48:31,738
For I love you so 

1379
01:48:32,238 --> 01:48:35,240
Sonny boy
