        EASTER AT HOME,

304
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,437
MAMA NUNZIA.

305
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,837
HAVE YOU ANY        
            OF THE GOOD WINE?

306
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,740
AH, MASTER ALFIO.               
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

307
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,910
I WAS IN FRANCOFONTE,   
        IF YOU MUST KNOW.

308
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,745
TURRIDU WAS                     
SUPPOSED TO BRING

309
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,514
SOME WINE BACK                  
FROM FRANCOFONTE.

310
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,116
YOUR SON TURRIDU    
            IS STILL HERE.

311
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,418
I SAW HIM THIS MORNING  
        AROUND MY PLACE.

312
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,054
HE WAS RUNNING LIKE     
        HE WAS IN A BIG HURRY.

313
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:15,093
QUITE ONE OF THE FAMILY NOW,
    AREN'T YOU, MISS SANTA?

314
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,562
LOOK THE WAY HE MOVES.

315
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,666
BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL MAN.

316
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,301
GET OUT! NOW!

317
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,302
NOTE THIS.

318
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,070
SANTUZZA...

319
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,974
YOU MUST THROW YOURSELF AT  
    THE FEET OF THE CRUCIFIED!

320
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:36,380
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

321
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,681
HERE IN THE MIDDLE  
            OF THE STREET?

322
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,383
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.

323
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,851
TELL ME WHERE YOU WERE          
LAST NIGHT.

324
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,852
HO HO!

325
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:42,786
HO HO!

326
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,559
WHAT DOES THIS SIGNIFY?

327
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,561
I WAS WHERE IT                  
PLEASED ME TO BE.

328
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,029
I WAS IN FRANCOFONTE,         
  IF YOU WANT TO KNOW.

329
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,465
I WAS IN FRANCOFONTE,   
        IF YOU MUST KNOW!

330
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,167
THAT'S RIGHT.

331
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:57,568
YOU KIDS, SHH!                  
                    QUIET!

332
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,136
YOU STILL LOVE HER.

333
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,171
OH, SHUT--SHUT UP!

334
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,741
I WON'T SHUT UP!            
    I HAVE RABIES IN MY HEART!

335
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,245
YOU'RE CRAZY WITH               
THIS JEALOUSY OF YOURS!

336
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,716
YOU'RE CRAZY WITH               
THIS JEALOUSY OF YOURS!

337
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,720
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE              
I--I WAS A LITTLE BOY

338
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,022
AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT     
TO DO WHAT I WANT!

339
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,390
I WANT TO DO WHAT I WANT        
WHEN I WANT TO DO IT!

340
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,727
UNTIL NOW--THANK GOD I HAVE     
NO COLLAR AROUND MY NECK!

341
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:23,961
WHAT WILL I DO      
            IF YOU ABANDON ME?

342
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,095
I'M NOT!

343
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,698
WHAT'S HE DOING? HE'S       
    CHANGING ALL THE BLOCKING.

344
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,135
I'M NOT ABANDONING YOU.

345
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,537
THIS IS GOOD.

346
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,205
THIS IS SPONTANEOUS.        
    I LIKE THIS.

347
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:35,439
NO!

348
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,907
I AM NOT ABANDONING YOU!

349
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,242
KILL ME! KILL ME!

350
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,243
"Blood of Judas!"

351
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,744
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE!           
KILL ME!

352
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,046
DO IT.                  
                        "Judas."

353
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,148
I CAN'T MOVE BACKWARDS          
OR FORWARDS!

354
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,651
I'M TIED TO                   
  YOUR APRON STRINGS.

355
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,653
I DON'T KNOW WHERE              
I AM ANYMORE.

356
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,121
PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE ME!

357
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,224
TURRIDU, DON'T LEAVE ME!

358
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,224
TURRIDU!

359
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,227
"Blood of Judas."

360
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,663
TURRIDU, DON'T LEAVE ME!

361
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,098
OHH...

362
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,934
[PANTING] MOTHER?

363
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,270
MOTHER!

364
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,273
MOTHER, EMBRACE ME NOW          
AS YOU DID WHEN I LEFT

365
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:12,643
TO BECOME A SOLDIER,            
BECAUSE TODAY IS EASTER.

366
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,413
TURRIDU.            
            DON'T LEAVE ME.

367
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:18,749
WONDERFUL. I'VE NEVER, EVER 
    SEEN ANYTHING SO REAL.

368
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,186
TURRIDU...

369
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,454
DON'T LEAVE ME.

370
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,856
TURRIDU...

371
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:27,425
GO ON WITH THE PLAY.

372
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,627
TURRIDU!

373
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,796
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS            
WHEN AN ACTOR IS MISCAST.

374
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:33,864
TURRIDU!

375
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,766
IS HE DEAD?

376
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:36,900
TURRIDU!

377
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,444
I THINK             
            THERE'S A PROBLEM.

378
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:47,845
I DIDN'T SEE
                    ANY BLOOD.

379
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,747
THERE ISN'T ANY BLOOD.          
IT'S A SYMBOL.

380
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,749
EITHER YOUR INTELLIGENCE        
IS SUFFICIENT

381
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,118
TO UNDERSTAND SYMBOLS           
OR IT ISN'T.

382
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,686
YOURS IS INSUFFICIENT.

383
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,321
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,       
        THERE WILL BE

384
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,692
A BRIEF BUT SEATED...       
        INTERMISSION.

385
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:05,463
THERE IS NOTHING I LIKE BETTER  
THAN THINGS LIKE THIS.

386
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,966
WELL?

387
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:09,967
HE'S ALIVE.

388
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,101
CAN HE ACT?

389
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,036
I'LL PLAY   
                    TURRIDU!

390
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,538
YOU ARE NOT PLAYING 
            THAT PART.

391
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,873
IT'S ALWAYS                 
    BEEN MY PART!

392
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,475
I AM THE MANAGER    
            OF THIS COMPANY.

393
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,076
WHAT HAVE I DONE            
    TO MAKE YOU

394
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,177
CONTINUALLY PUNISH ME       
    THIS WAY?

395
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,679
"HO HO!"    
APART FROM THAT.

396
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,148
YOUR PERFORMANCE LAST NIGHT 
    WAS A TOOTH-PULLER.

397
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,616
YOU FUCKED ALL DAY!

398
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:27,117
THIS BUSINESS IS        
        BASED ON FORNICATION.

399
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:30,454
"TOOTH-PULLER"?                 
THIS TIME YOU GO TOO FAR.

400
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,055
Flavio: SILENCE!

401
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,593
LET US START            
        A GENERAL TOPIC!

402
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:39,730
LET IT BE...            
    "THE ORIGINS OF DRAMA."

403
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,702
I WILL SPEAK SECOND.

404
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:47,037
[BOOING AND WHISTLING]

405
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:51,909
SHH!    
SHH!

406
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,846
I CAN SMELL POWDER.         
        I LIKE THAT.

407
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,581
[LAUGHTER]

408
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,023
I KNEW A MAN ONCE...

409
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:08,525
WHO ASKED HIS WIFE...

410
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,328
"HOW DO YOU WANT ME         
    TO LOVE YOU?"

411
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:15,099
THE MAN BECAME INFATUATED   
    WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

412
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,136
"DO YOU WANT ME TO LOVE YOU 
    WITHOUT SUFFERING?"

413
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,872
HE FORCED HIS WIFE          
    INTO THE HUMILIATION

414
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:24,875
OF INVITING THE OTHER WOMAN 
        TO DINNER.

415
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:28,212
"DO YOU WANT ME TO LOVE YOU 
        WITHOUT CRUELTY?"

416
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,216
HE SPENT THE ENTIRE EVENING 
    SITTING NEXT TO THIS WOMAN

417
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,619
WHILE HIS WIFE          
    SAT ALONE AND SILENT

418
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,055
LOOKING OUT A WINDOW        
    INTO THE NIGHT.

419
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:41,058
THE OTHER WOMAN             
    RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE.

420
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,993
HE RAN AFTER HER,           
    IN THE RAIN,

421
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:46,563
RUNNING THROUGH THE STREETS,
    SCREAMING HER NAME.

422
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:49,466
HE DIDN'T FIND HER.

423
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,870
HE CAME HOME.

424
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:56,240
HIS WIFE HAD DRUNK IODINE.

425
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,111
"HOW COULD YOU?"        
        HE SHOOK HER.

426
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,082
"HOW COULD YOU?"

427
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:11,955
"I CANNOT THINK OF LIFE     
        WITHOUT YOU."

428
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:15,425
SHE...VOMITED.

429
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,129
"DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND

430
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:22,532
"WHAT A BEAUTIFUL LOVE      
    I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU

431
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,600
IN LOVING YOU?"

432
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:29,539
SHE WENT ON VOMITING.

433
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,309
"WHAT A BEAUTIFUL LOVE

434
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,278
I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU."

435
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:44,321
WHAT A DELUSION TO BELIEVE  
    THERE IS ORDER OR LOGIC

436
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,190
IN THE EVENTS OF OUR LIVES.

437
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,392
THIS AFTERNOON          
    YOU CAME TO SEE A PLAY,

438
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,762
A PLAY WITH THE ACTOR PIERO 
        PLAYING A ROLE

439
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,532
IN WHICH HE WAS TO HAVE     
    DIED A JEALOUS DEATH,

440
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,370
AN IMAGINED...JEALOUS DEATH.

441
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:05,142
AND NOW...              
    THE UNIMAGINABLE HAS STRUCK.

442
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:08,812
PIERO...

443
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,381
OUR PIERO...

444
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,852
<i>  THE</i>  PIERO...

445
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,220
IS GONE.

446
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,590
YES...

447
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,993
HE DIES FOR REAL.

448
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,665
A MOMENT, PLEASE.

449
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:38,408
HE DIED?            
    HE HAD SUCH POTENTIAL.

450
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,843
DID HE SAY I'M DEAD?
            I'M NOT DEAD.

451
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,778
SHH. YOU'LL COME BACK.

452
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,247
Tuccio:             
    THERE IS ANOTHER PLAY

453
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,650
SPAWNED IN THE STORY        
    I HAVE JUST TOLD YOU.

454
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,620
A PLAY OF MINE...

455
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:54,324
TO BE PERFORMED TOMORROW.

WHICH IS THE ESSENCE

910
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:55,177
OF MY LIVELIHOOD.

911
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:00,782
WELL...

912
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,752
THE GREAT SHIP SAILS.

913
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,826
TAKE ME TO MY ACCUSER...

914
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,428
THIS PUPO.

915
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:18,601
[DOOR OPENS]

916
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:30,812
[DOOR CLOSES]

917
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,582
WELL, IT APPEARS THINGS         
ARE NOT GOING VERY WELL,

918
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:36,418
SO MY WIFE AND I...

919
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:39,221
MY WIFE HAS DECIDED           
  YOU WILL DO<i>  A DOLL'S HOUSE.</i>

920
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,656
IBSEN?                      
                    IBSEN?

921
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,391
YES, IBSEN.                     
HE HAS GREAT APPEAL

922
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,459
AMONG THE THINKING CLASS.

923
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:44,460
THE THINKING CLASS?

924
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:45,827
WHO'S HEARD OF THEM?

925
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:46,828
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

926
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:49,031
WHAT ABOUT          
            TUCCIO'S PLAY?

927
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,299
IT'S NOT FINISHED.

928
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,000
MY PLAY?                
    IN WHOSE OPINION?

929
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:53,402
IN UMBERTO BEVALAQUA'S.

930
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:54,537
THAT SODOMITE.

931
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:56,004
AND EVERY OTHER CRITIC.

932
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,940
I HATE TO REMIND YOU,           
BUT YOU ARE UNDER CONTRACT.

933
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,309
I TOLD YOU NOT TO SIGN IT.

934
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,527
AND HOW ARE WE TO EAT?

935
00:48:01,595 --> 00:48:03,078
YOU AND YOUR EATING.

936
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:04,079
WHAT ABOUT MY PLAY?

937
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:06,048
YOUR PLAY?

938
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:07,783
IF YOUR CONCERN'S       
        ALL WITH YOUR PLAY

939
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:09,051
AND NONE WITH ME,

940
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,852
PALLENCHIO CAN ANSWER   
        YOUR DEMANDS.

941
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,955
UH, THE STAR'S              
    DEFINITELY MOVING

942
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:15,757
TO THE NORTH,               
    THOUGH, ISN'T IT?

943
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:17,959
HMM? WITH IBSEN...

944
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:20,996
THE OTHER ONE.

945
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,064
IS THERE LOVE IN THIS 
        <i>  DOLL'S HOUSE?</i>

946
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,065
Orlandini:                  
    NO ONE WILL SEE IT.

947
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:26,669
EVERYONE IS SEEING IT.          
HE'S THE RAGE.

948
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,308
YOU'D DO THIS<i>  DOLL'S HOUSE?</i>

949
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:33,809
Rachel: NOW'S           
        NOT THE TIME, TUCCIO.

950
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:34,943
FOR ME, IT IS.

951
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,263
MY TIME--IT'S NOT YOUR PLAY.    
IT'S MY PLAY.

952
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:38,314
OH, GOD,            
            THIS SELFISHNESS--

953
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,716
"MY PLAY. MY PLAY." 
            I CAN'T STAND IT.

954
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:42,501
MAYBE THIS IBSEN                
IS MORE TO YOUR LIKING.

955
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:43,535
YES.        
                    MAYBE HE IS.

956
00:48:43,604 --> 00:48:45,588
GOOD.               MAYBE       
THEN DO HIM.        I WILL.

957
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,323
DON'T SAY MAYBE.

958
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,525
GO AHEAD.               
        DO HIM.

959
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,560
GO TO PALLENCHIO      
          RIGHT NOW.

960
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:54,230
TELL HIM,               
        "I, THE GREAT RACHEL,

961
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:56,265
"LOVER TO               
        THE MEDIOCRITY TUCCIO,

962
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:58,434
"AM HERE TO EAT.

963
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:00,536
"GIVE ME IBSEN          
        AND SOME SAUSAGE.

964
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:01,520
I AM READY."

965
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:03,572
I AM SURE, AS ALWAYS,

966
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:05,173
YOU'LL TRANSFORM        
        THE MOMENT

967
00:49:05,243 --> 00:49:07,008
INTO SOMETHING...

968
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,310
INCANDESCENT.

969
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:17,819
Dominique:                      
TUCCIO--

970
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:18,820
IT'S HER LIFE.

971
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,155
LET HER LIVE IT 
                AS SHE SEES FIT.

972
00:49:20,224 --> 00:49:21,590
TUCCIO, TO DO                   
THIS IBSEN PLAY

973
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:23,325
DOESN'T MEAN                    
SHE'S FINISHED WITH YOU.

974
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,327
ARE YOU SPEAKING
                FOR RACHEL

975
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:26,828
OR FOR YOURSELF,
                DOMINIQUE?

976
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,029
HOW AM I TO TAKE THAT?

977
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:30,098
WELL, TAKE IT       
            ANY WAY YOU CHOOSE.

978
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,333
AND WHAT IF I CHOOSE            
TO RESENT IT?

979
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:32,901
WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS          
    A LONG TIME, TUCCIO.

980
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,236
FRIENDSHIP              
        MUST BE TESTED

981
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,337
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

982
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:36,405
YOU SHOULD GO BACK TO HER,

983
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,506
IF YOU DON'T MIND           
    MY SAYING SO.

984
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:38,540
I, TO HER?

985
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:39,808
DO YOU EXPECT ME                
TO REFUSE THIS IBSEN PLAY?

986
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:41,243
I EXPECT NOTHING.

987
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,113
OUR LIVES           
            WIND THEMSELVES OUT.

988
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:50,519
WHEN THEY WIND TOGETHER,
        THAT IS SOMETHING FINE

989
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:51,453
AND RARE.

990
00:49:52,757 --> 00:49:54,290
WHEN THEY UNRAVEL,      
        I'LL LEAVE IT TO OTHERS

991
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,857
TO DIAGNOSE THE CAUSE.

992
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,699
I'LL SEND A LETTER          
    TO THE MAGISTRATE

993
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:05,033
ON YOUR FATHER'S BEHALF.

994
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,635
WE'LL DO ALL WE CAN,

995
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:08,170
BUT I BEG YOU, RACHEL,

996
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,672
DON'T MIX               
    YOUR LOVE AND YOUR ART.

997
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,675
YOU DO VIOLENCE             
    TO YOUR NATURE, YOUR TALENT.

998
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,610
I NEED SOMETHING NEW.

999
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:15,911
TUCCIO'S PLAY--

1000
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:17,379
TUCCIO'S PLAY?

1001
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:18,681
BELONGS TO MY TIME.

1002
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,215
HAS NO ENDING.

1003
00:50:20,284 --> 00:50:21,967
IT IS IN THE AIR
                THAT I BREATHE.

1004
00:50:22,036 --> 00:50:23,285
DO<i>  CAMILLE.</i>

1005
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,120
THE PEOPLE                    
  LOVE YOU IN<i>  CAMILLE.</i>

1006
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,322
JUST BECAUSE            
        YOU LOVE HIM

1007
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,457
DOESN'T MAKE HIM            
    A GREAT DRAMATIST.

1008
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:29,625
DO YOU THINK            
    YOU'RE THE ONLY WOMAN

1009
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,193
THAT'S EVER             
    BEEN FOOLED BY A MAN?

1010
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:33,328
CELIMENE DRAGGED HER LOVER  
        AROUND FOR YEARS

1011
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,397
FOISTING HIM            
        UPON AUDIENCES.

1012
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:36,898
HE WAS BEAUTIFUL.

1013
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:37,899
HE WAS A DONKEY.

1014
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:40,035
YOU COMPARE TUCCIO  
            TO CELIMENE'S WHORE?

1015
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,670
OH, HE WAS A WHORE.             
SHE'S RIGHT.

1016
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:43,238
BUT WHAT A WHORE.

1017
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:45,741
QUIET.              
        THE POINT IS...

1018
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,810
THAT THE TEST           
        OF AN ARTIST

1019
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,779
IS IF HE CAN STAND          
        ON HIS OWN.

1020
00:50:50,848 --> 00:50:53,515
WOULD TUCCIO            
    BE DONE WITHOUT YOU?

1021
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:55,651
NO, NEVER.                      
LISTEN...

1022
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,919
IN TUCCIO'S PLAY,               
THE HUSBAND BETRAYS THE WIFE,

1023
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,054
AND WHAT DOES SHE DO?

1024
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:00,889
SHE DOESN'T TAKE REVENGE.       
SHE DOESN'T KILL HIM.

1025
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:01,974
SHE DOESN'T EVEN LEAVE HIM.

1026
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:04,326
SHE GOES ON LOVING HIM.

1027
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,829
THAT'S HIS ENDING.

1028
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,797
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

1029
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:11,099
DID YOU EVER SEE              
  THE END OF<i>  ANTONY?</i>

1030
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:12,368
DO YOU KNOW                   
  HOW<i>  ANTONY</i>  ENDS?

1031
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:14,603
THE ENDING OF<i>  ANTONY?</i>

1032
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:17,439
ANTONY'S MISTRESS HEARS         
HER HUSBAND'S FOOTSTEPS.

1033
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:19,842
THE HUSBAND HAS RETURNED        
UNEXPECTEDLY,

1034
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,042
SO, ANTONY,                     
OF COURSE, SUGGESTS

1035
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,579
THAT HE AND THE LADY            
SHOULD CLEAR OUT.

1036
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:24,946
"OH, NO," SHE SAYS,

1037
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:27,015
"I MUST KEEP                    
MY REPUTATION."

1038
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,435
SO, WITH THE HUSBAND            
COMING UP THE STAIRS,

1039
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:31,987
ANTONY STABS HER                
THROUGH THE HEART,

1040
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:33,622
FLINGS OPEN THE DOOR,           
AND SAYS,

1041
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:37,058
"I KILLED HER                   
WITH THIS DAGGER.

1042
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:38,927
SHE RESISTED ME."

1043
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:42,798
WHAT A CURIOUS WAY  
            TO PRESERVE

1044
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:44,266
A LADY'S REPUTATION.

1045
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:46,402
YOU THINK SO? WELL,             
THE AUDIENCE WENT WILD--

1046
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,770
ESPECIALLY                      
IN THE CHEAPER SEATS.

1047
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:50,439
BUT NOT JUST HERE               
IN AMERICA--ALL OVER.

1048
00:51:50,508 --> 00:51:53,275
ALL THE GREAT ENDINGS.

1049
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,444
OEDIPUS HAS SEX                 
WITH HIS MOTHER,

1050
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:56,945
AND, WHAT?                      
HE SAYS, "I'M SORRY"?

1051
00:51:57,014 --> 00:51:59,047
HE TEARS HIS EYES OUT.

1052
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,316
OTHELLO THINKS                  
HIS WIFE AND CASSIO--

1053
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:02,317

01:39:58,259 --> 01:40:00,893
FORWARD.

1982
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:19,612
YOU LIED TO ME,                 
AND I KNOW IT.

1983
01:40:21,616 --> 01:40:24,517
I CANNOT IGNORE                 
WHAT YOU'VE DONE,

1984
01:40:24,586 --> 01:40:27,453
BUT I MUST NOT FORGET           
YOUR FIRST KINDNESSES,

1985
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:31,357
FOR EACH HOUR IN LIFE           
HAS ITS OWN WORTH.

1986
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:35,761
HOW YOU MUST BE SUFFERING

1987
01:40:35,830 --> 01:40:38,598
THAT YOU SHOULD                 
TORTURE ME LIKE THIS.

1988
01:40:38,666 --> 01:40:40,032
[SIGHS]

1989
01:40:40,101 --> 01:40:42,468
YOU NEED ONLY SAY,  
            "PLEASE GO."

1990
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:48,508
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL LOVE           
I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU,

1991
01:40:48,576 --> 01:40:50,442
LOVING YOU.

1992
01:40:54,348 --> 01:40:57,249
I WOULD LIKE SO MUCH            
FOR YOU TO LIKE ME AGAIN.

1993
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:02,822
I KNOW I'VE BEEN LESS           
THAN I COULD BE.

1994
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:06,425
THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN I ASK    
MYSELF IF I PLEASE YOU.

1995
01:41:08,295 --> 01:41:10,162
I AM NOT A YOUNG GIRL...

1996
01:41:12,366 --> 01:41:14,266
NOR AN OLD WOMAN.

1997
01:41:17,138 --> 01:41:20,506
I HAVE NO DESIRE                
TO DECEIVE YOU.

1998
01:41:20,575 --> 01:41:23,776
IT WOULD BE EXCITING,           
BUT HOW LONG WOULD IT LAST?

1999
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:31,918
WHATEVER I COULD,               
I'VE GIVEN.

2000
01:41:35,122 --> 01:41:37,389
LIFE HAS SHAKEN                 
MY CONFIDENCE.

2001
01:41:40,428 --> 01:41:43,429
EVERYTHING I HOPED TO BE

2002
01:41:43,497 --> 01:41:46,298
HAS NOT TURNED OUT              
ALWAYS AS I DREAMED.

2003
01:41:49,737 --> 01:41:51,871
EXCEPT FOR YOU.

2004
01:41:59,781 --> 01:42:02,848
I CANNOT THINK OF LIFE          
WITHOUT YOU.

2005
01:42:04,618 --> 01:42:07,186
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

2006
01:42:07,254 --> 01:42:08,888
MY HUSBAND.

2007
01:42:11,025 --> 01:42:12,224
MY LIFE.

2008
01:42:21,069 --> 01:42:24,269
I HOPE YOU CAN LIVE             
WITH THIS AMOUNT OF ME.

2009
01:42:37,018 --> 01:42:39,985
THE SKY HAS SOMETHING   
        SO SAD ABOUT IT.

2010
01:42:49,697 --> 01:42:50,963
ILLUMINATA.

2011
01:42:55,436 --> 01:42:56,869
MY ILLUMINATA.

2012
01:42:58,806 --> 01:43:02,507
THERE IS SOMETHING      
        CRUEL IN EVERY LOVE.

2013
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:07,012
MY HEART                
        HAS WRONGED YOU...

2014
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:11,917
AND IT HAS WRONGED YOU  
        BEFORE.

2015
01:43:15,556 --> 01:43:17,623
IT MEANS...

2016
01:43:17,692 --> 01:43:19,191
I AM IMPERFECT...

2017
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:23,895
BORN IMPERFECT...

2018
01:43:23,964 --> 01:43:28,200
EDUCATED IMPERFECTLY...

2019
01:43:28,268 --> 01:43:32,070
MOLDED IN               
        MY FORMATIVE YEARS

2020
01:43:32,123 --> 01:43:34,906
BY IMPERFECT HANDS,

2021
01:43:34,975 --> 01:43:37,275
AND SO...

2022
01:43:37,345 --> 01:43:38,977
EXPECT NAUGHT ELSE.

2023
01:43:42,249 --> 01:43:45,116
BUT IF YOU LOOK FOR     
        SOMEONE TO LOVE YOU...

2024
01:43:46,787 --> 01:43:48,286
IMPERFECTLY...

2025
01:43:51,124 --> 01:43:52,391
LOOK NO FURTHER.

2026
01:43:53,594 --> 01:43:54,760
I AM HE.

2027
01:43:57,531 --> 01:43:59,498
IF YOU WILL             
        STILL LOVE ME.

2028
01:44:06,306 --> 01:44:07,406
I AM HE.
