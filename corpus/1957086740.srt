No, son, let me

"well, how do I get into heaven?
I'm just an average man.

185
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:57,559
Sometimes I'm good.
Sometimes I'm bad.

186
00:12:57,646 --> 00:13:00,388
Sometimes I've got love
bloomin' in my heart,

187
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:02,303
and sometimes it is dark
as the devil!"

I am lost, and I am lonely."

come down! Come down!

263
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:04,752
Old Templeton: I began to pray,

264
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:07,929
my face upturned
to the heavens,

265
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:11,585
tears streaming.

266
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:14,588
And in a moment,
a weight began to lift,

267
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:17,765
a weight as heavy as I.

268
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:21,595
It had passed through
my face, my belly, my chest,

269
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:25,816
my arms, my shoulders,
and lifted off entirely.

270
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:29,820
And I felt I could've
leapt over a wall.

271
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:35,609
An ineffable warmth,
a warmth began to suffuse.

272
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,785
A light turned on
in my chest,

273
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:43,617
and its refining fire
cleansed me.

274
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:46,794
I hardly dared breathe,
fearing I might end this,

275
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:49,927
or alter the moment.

276
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:56,673
And somewhere, somewhere
in that darkness,

277
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:03,289
I, I heard a still,
small voice, my own,

278
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:07,815
whispering softly over,
and over, and over again,

279

"thank you, lord!
Thank you, lord!

the basis of our teaching
here at Florida Bible institute

306
00:22:15,246 --> 00:22:19,120

of the word of god.

Dr. Minder: The term,
"evangelist,"

315
00:22:51,021 --> 00:22:54,460
comes from the Greek word,
"evangelion."

316

"good news",

01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:05,689
He says, to Billy, "I'm an
old man, and I'm dying,

845
01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:12,391
and I want you to take over
as president of my college."

846
01:00:12,478 --> 01:00:16,438
Billy Graham, I mean,
president of a college.

847
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:18,223
Amazing!

848
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:20,312
I mean, he had
a bachelor's degree

849
01:00:20,399 --> 01:00:22,314
from wheaton college
in anthropology.

850
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:24,708
I mean, that's it.

851
01:00:24,795 --> 01:00:27,406
All of a sudden, there he is,

852
01:00:27,493 --> 01:00:33,717
the youngest college president
in the United States.

853
01:00:33,804 --> 01:00:36,154
[Phone ringing]

854
01:00:36,241 --> 01:00:38,243
Laverne: Office of
the president.

855
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:40,158
Can you hold, please?

856
01:00:40,245 --> 01:00:45,424
Mr. Wilson, can you field this?
It's them again.

857
01:00:45,511 --> 01:00:52,083
T.w.: T.W.
Yes, mighty interested.

858
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:53,388
I'll, I'll get back to you
by close of business.

859
01:00:53,475 --> 01:00:55,739
Thank you.

860
01:00:55,826 --> 01:00:57,392
Billy: Is that Los Angeles?

861
01:00:57,479 --> 01:00:59,612
T.w: It's their third call.

862
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:01,266
Laverne: Here's your
messages, Mr. President,
and your magazine.

863
01:01:01,353 --> 01:01:03,137
Billy: Thank you, Laverne.
Tell Robert hello.

864
01:01:03,224 --> 01:01:04,748
How much they have to offer?

865
01:01:04,835 --> 01:01:06,227
T.w.: Two-thousand
for the entire event,

866
01:01:06,314 --> 01:01:07,228
but I told them we need
at least 10,000.

867
01:01:07,315 --> 01:01:08,360
Billy: We need 25,000.

868
01:01:08,447 --> 01:01:11,450
T.w.: 25,000?

869
01:01:11,537 --> 01:01:14,192
Billy: What about Charles?
Is he on board?

870
01:01:14,279 --> 01:01:17,369
T.w.: No.

871
01:01:17,456 --> 01:01:22,374
Billy: Then to do it right,
we need $25,000.

872
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:24,463
Reporter: Tell US
about the scandal,

873
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:28,423
Billy Graham and the picture
holding the sack of money.

874
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:33,124
Old Templeton: Oh, that.

875
01:01:33,211 --> 01:01:40,131
In those days, the, ah,
the final offering in churches,
and tents, and halls-

876
01:01:40,218 --> 01:01:42,394
I mean, they used to call it
the "love offering."

877
01:01:42,481 --> 01:01:44,396
It would go to cover
the evangelists' expenses

878
01:01:44,483 --> 01:01:47,138
and, and go on
to the next campaign.

879
01:01:47,225 --> 01:01:58,192
And anyway, some ambitious
reporter takes a picture
of Billy with the money.

880
01:01:58,279 --> 01:01:59,759
It was nonsense.

881
01:01:59,846 --> 01:02:03,154
I mean, Billy made sure
that he was accountable

882
01:02:03,241 --> 01:02:05,330
for every penny collected.

883
01:02:05,417 --> 01:02:07,549
He was completely transparent.

884
01:02:07,636 --> 01:02:12,424
One day, he said, "now boys, I,
I want you to go to your rooms,

885
01:02:12,511 --> 01:02:14,469
and I want you write down
the things

886
01:02:14,556 --> 01:02:18,169
that can cause the downfall
of an evangelist."

887
01:02:18,256 --> 01:02:20,562
They all had the same items.

888
01:02:20,649 --> 01:02:24,828
And Billy said, "alright fellas,
these are the rules:

889
01:02:24,915 --> 01:02:29,310
From now on, no man
is to be in a room

890
01:02:29,397 --> 01:02:33,837
alone with a woman
other than his wife."

891
01:02:33,924 --> 01:02:36,491
He said, "we're not even
going to let there be

892
01:02:36,578 --> 01:02:41,366
a breath of scandal
in this ministry."

893
01:02:41,453 --> 01:02:48,547
I mean, Billy Graham is the most
scrupulously honest person

894
01:02:48,634 --> 01:02:52,856
that I have ever met.

895
01:02:52,943 --> 01:02:59,776
And when I needed a friend,
he was always there.

896
01:03:02,474 --> 01:03:07,392
Young Templeton:
Bill, how can anyone

897
01:03:07,479 --> 01:03:12,876
take the Bible as literal
word of god?

898
01:03:12,963 --> 01:03:14,181
Billy: What do you mean?

899
01:03:14,268 --> 01:03:16,531
Young Templeton: Jonah
and the whale.

900
01:03:16,618 --> 01:03:19,883
Do you think that a whale
actually swallowed a man
and spat him out?

901
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:22,886
Or, or, or that god made
the sun stand still in the sky.

902
01:03:22,973 --> 01:03:27,412
Do you honestly believe that
the earth stopped revolving?

903
01:03:27,499 --> 01:03:31,895
Where is the hard science
to back these stories up?

904
01:03:31,982 --> 01:03:36,464
And if the Bible is not true
in each and every case,

905
01:03:36,551 --> 01:03:40,904
then doesn't that cast doubt
on all of it?

906
01:03:40,991 --> 01:03:43,428
Billy: Charles, it's the word
of god.

907
01:03:43,515 --> 01:03:46,257
Young Templeton: But what if
it's wrong, Billy?

908
01:03:46,344 --> 01:03:51,262
Nothing more than feeble stories
written by men like you and me,

909
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:55,919
attempting to answer
the great questions of life.

910
01:03:56,006 --> 01:04:02,621
If it's wrong, then what
about the rest?

911
01:04:10,368 --> 01:04:17,941
Old Templeton: He went down
his path...

912
01:04:18,028 --> 01:04:20,334
I went down another.

913
01:04:29,778 --> 01:04:31,432
Young Templeton:
Good evening, everyone.

914
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:35,959
Thank you so much
for coming out tonight.

915
01:04:36,046 --> 01:04:42,313
As I look out, I see a lot
of familiar faces.

916
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:47,492
I've known some of you since
you came into this world.

917
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:51,975
I have seen some of you
through times, good,

918
01:04:52,062 --> 01:04:54,673
and through times not so good.

919
01:04:54,760 --> 01:05:04,378
And it has been my honor,
my deepest honor,
to serve you.

920
01:05:04,465 --> 01:05:13,997
But I am here
with heavy heart.

921
01:05:14,084 --> 01:05:19,002
In me, you put your trust
for spiritual guidance,

922
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:22,353
and I realize the responsibility
and the honor of this.

923
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:29,708
I realize it to the center
of my core.

924
01:05:29,795 --> 01:05:40,371
And so, it pains me,
but I must confess this.

925
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:45,463
I find that I can no longer
accept many of the tenets,

926
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:57,040
the fundamental tenets,
of the Christian faith.

927
01:05:57,127 --> 01:05:59,216
I see now that there are
other truths-

928
01:05:59,303 --> 01:06:04,047
that there are other paths,
other perspectives,
other ways.

929
01:06:04,134 --> 01:06:10,749
So, to continue on this journey
toward greater understanding,

930
01:06:10,836 --> 01:06:21,673
toward an ever-widening
search for truth,

931
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,459
I've accepted a position
at Princeton university.

932
01:06:25,546 --> 01:06:35,513
[Instrumental music]

933
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:44,739
[Instrumental music]

934
01:06:44,826 --> 01:06:55,446
Young Templeton: And this means
that I am leaving this ministry.

935
01:06:55,533 --> 01:07:01,104
Billy: Charles Templeton
is my best friend,

936
01:07:01,191 --> 01:07:08,546
and there is nothing
dishonest in that man.

937
01:07:08,633 --> 01:07:11,636
And, because of a crisis
of his faith,

938
01:07:11,723 --> 01:07:17,642
he felt a moral imperative
to resign from his positions

939
01:07:17,729 --> 01:07:22,647
to no longer preach that
which he could no longer
fully believe.

940
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:34,659
And that is not hypocrisy,
that is integrity.

941
01:07:34,746 --> 01:07:37,792
And, I will not stand
with anyone

942
01:07:37,879 --> 01:07:45,670
who will denounce my friend.

943
01:07:45,757 --> 01:07:51,850
Instead, let US pray for him.

944
01:07:51,937 --> 01:08:01,860
[Instrumental music]

945
01:08:01,947 --> 01:08:09,824
[Instrumental music]

946
01:08:09,911 --> 01:08:11,783
[Knocking on door]

947
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:13,828
Laverne: Mr. Graham?

948
01:08:13,915 --> 01:08:17,702
Mr. Graham?

949
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:19,704
Billy: Oh, I'm sorry, Laverne.

950
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:20,879
Laverne: Well, you've
been confirmed

951
01:08:20,966 --> 01:08:23,664
at the forest home conference.

952
01:08:23,751 --> 01:08:25,971
Billy: Forest home?

953
01:08:26,058 --> 01:08:30,541
Laverne: You'll be
the youngest college
president speaking there.

954
01:08:30,628 --> 01:08:34,806
It's very interesting...
Dr's Evan and Hamilton,
from Oxford will be there.

955
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:38,853
And so will your friend,
Charles Templeton.

956
01:08:49,037 --> 01:08:51,736
Billy: Thank you, Laverne.

957
01:08:51,823 --> 01:09:00,832
[Instrumental music]

958
01:09:03,965 --> 01:09:05,924
Mrs. Meirs: Billy, how wonderful
to see you.

959
01:09:06,011 --> 01:09:08,709
Billy: And you, Mrs. Meirs.
Ah, these are for you.

960
01:09:08,796 --> 01:09:12,583
Mrs. Meirs: Always thoughtful.
Come inside, please.

961
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:14,324
I think you know Dr. Bob.

962
01:09:14,411 --> 01:09:15,934
Dr. Bob Evans: Billy, so glad
you could make it.

963
01:09:16,021 --> 01:09:17,892
Billy: I've heard such
great things, sir.

964
01:09:17,979 --> 01:09:20,112
Mrs. Meirs: Charles!

965
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:21,853
Young Templeton: Thank you
so much for having US
to your home.

966
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:25,770
You remember my wife, Connie.
Bob, how are you?

967
01:09:25,857 --> 01:09:27,685
You know, I, I just finished
reading your dissertation

968
01:09:27,772 --> 01:09:29,904
on the Neo-orthodoxy
and the barth comparative study,

969
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:32,255
and I have to tell you,
it is brilliant work.

970
01:09:32,342 --> 01:09:34,126
Dr. Bob Evans: Well,
thank you, Charles.

971
01:09:34,213 --> 01:09:36,868
I'm afraid it probably created
more questions than it answered.

972
01:09:36,955 --> 01:09:40,785
Young Templeton: Excuse me.Billy: Chuck, it's good
to see ya.

973
01:09:40,872 --> 01:09:44,267
Young Templeton: Billy,
it's good to see you too.

974
01:09:44,354 --> 01:09:47,966
Tell me, are you still
speaking for god?

975
01:09:48,053 --> 01:09:50,969
Billy: Well, god speaks
for himself, Charles.

976
01:09:51,056 --> 01:09:53,754
I just testify about what
the word has meant for me.

977
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:57,976
Young Templeton: Ha, ha, ha...
Billy, Billy.

978
01:09:58,063 --> 01:10:00,674
The world has grown
so much more complex,

979
01:10:00,761 --> 01:10:03,721
just in the last fifty years.

980
01:10:03,808 --> 01:10:07,290
When people seeking the truth
can no longer accept

981
01:10:07,377 --> 01:10:12,817
the simple rhetoric
that you were raised with
and preach with.

982
01:10:12,904 --> 01:10:15,646
When are you going
to get that?

983
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:17,822
That old time religion,
it's not good enough for me.

984
01:10:17,909 --> 01:10:19,998
And it's not good enough
for you either, Billy.

985
01:10:20,085 --> 01:10:22,000
Connie: Charles.

986
01:10:22,087 --> 01:10:23,828
Mrs. Meirs: Outspoken young man,
god bless his heart.

987
01:10:23,915 --> 01:10:25,917
Young Templeton: No, no, no
Connie, actually,

988
01:10:26,004 --> 01:10:28,659
I'm actually, I'm doing you
a big favor.

989
01:10:28,746 --> 01:10:33,925
You see, people no longer
accept the Bible as being
divinely inspired.

990
01:10:34,012 --> 01:10:38,886
There are too many
inconsistencies,
lapses, lacunae.

991
01:10:38,973 --> 01:10:45,023
How could any of US presume
that a document written by men

992
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:49,854
is the sacrosanct,
inalienable word of god?

993
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:52,944
It is a fairy tale.

994
01:10:57,078 --> 01:11:00,038
Billy: Well, 2.000 years ago,
the Bible prophesied

995
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:03,868
that god would gather his chosen
people from the four corners,

996
01:11:03,955 --> 01:11:06,174
and reunite them in
their homeland, and...

997
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:11,354
Young Templeton: God didn't
create the state of Israel...
Man did.

998
01:11:11,441 --> 01:11:14,008
The u.N. Did, after
six-million Jews,

999
01:11:14,095 --> 01:11:16,010
god's own "chosen people,"
were burned and gassed

1000
01:11:16,097 --> 01:11:20,014
in the ovens of Hitler.

1001
01:11:20,101 --> 01:11:21,712
Six million people, Billy.

1002
01:11:21,799 --> 01:11:23,975
All praying to their
god to be spared,

1003
01:11:24,062 --> 01:11:27,718
and not one prayer answered.

1004
01:11:27,805 --> 01:11:30,024
Is that your loving god?

1005
01:11:30,111 --> 01:11:33,071
Can you find his face in
the ovens in Auschwitz, Billy?

1006
01:11:33,158 --> 01:11:37,771
Or the fire storms of Nagasaki,
or the bombs of dresden?

1007
01:11:37,858 --> 01:11:41,862
I'm asking you, how could
a loving god have done that?

1008
01:11:45,823 --> 01:11:50,131
Billy: Charles, god didn't
do that.

1009
01:11:50,218 --> 01:11:52,395
Man did...

1010
01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:54,919
Young Templeton: Well then,
he permitted it, didn't he?

1011
01:11:55,006 --> 01:11:58,401
He stood by and you're
out there, Billy.

1012
01:11:58,488 --> 01:12:00,751
You're out there preaching
the "good news."

1013
01:12:00,838 --> 01:12:06,104
What good news?

1014
01:12:06,191 --> 01:12:08,759
Billy: The good news that
god so loved the world

1015
01:12:08,846 --> 01:12:09,934
that he gave his only...

1016
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:12,110
Young Templeton: Billy, Billy.

1017
01:12:12,197 --> 01:12:16,419
I believe that Jesus is
the most perfect moral being

1018
01:12:16,506 --> 01:12:17,942
in the history of the world.

1019
01:12:18,029 --> 01:12:19,770
I believe that Jesus is
the greatest teacher

1020
01:12:19,857 --> 01:12:21,467
in the history of western
civilization,

1021
01:12:21,554 --> 01:12:24,949
and I believe that Jesus
is the purest example

1022
01:12:25,036 --> 01:12:27,125
of all that is good
in mankind,

1023
01:12:27,212 --> 01:12:37,962
and, and I do not believe
that he is the son of god.

1024
01:12:38,049 --> 01:12:44,795
He's the son of a man.

1025
01:12:44,882 --> 01:12:51,976
I feel sorry for you, Billy.

1026
01:12:52,063 --> 01:12:57,155
What you call faith,
it is the death of intellect.

1027
01:13:00,898 --> 01:13:02,987
Bob Evans: Billy, you all right?

1028
01:13:03,074 --> 01:13:06,077
Billy: Yeah, yeah, thanks.

1029
01:13:13,563 --> 01:13:14,825
Morrow: Listen to me, Billy.

1030
01:13:14,912 --> 01:13:16,696
You're gettin'
all caught up in,

1031
01:13:16,783 --> 01:13:21,484
in man's prideful need to be
right about these things.

1032
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:23,486
Let me ask you
a question, honey.

1033
01:13:23,573 --> 01:13:26,489
What is your "callin'?"

1034
01:13:26,576 --> 01:13:28,360
Is it to go out and prove
every word in the Bible,

1035
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:32,973
or is it, is it to open people's
hearts and minds to the love,

1036
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:39,502
and healing power of our lord
Jesus Christ?

1037
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:41,939
Listen to your heart, Billy.

1038
01:13:42,026 --> 01:13:48,032
Billy: Maybe I'm just
not cut out for this.

1039
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:51,514
Morrow: God is with you,
Billy frank,

1040
01:13:51,601 --> 01:13:57,215
and will never leave you
and will never forsake you.

Billy: God, if you didn't
want me to preach,

1047
01:14:54,185 --> 01:14:56,927
why did you let me believe?

1048
01:14:57,014 --> 01:14:58,450
And if you want me to believe,

1049
01:14:58,537 --> 01:15:01,279
why can't you just give me
some proof?

1050
01:15:01,366 --> 01:15:05,196
There are questions in this book
that I just can't answer.

1051
01:15:05,283 --> 01:15:08,025
So, give me something!

1052
01:15:08,112 --> 01:15:11,115
Anything!

1053
01:15:11,202 --> 01:15:14,205

K: On this day in Charlotte, e asking god to Grant his nation,

1064
01:15:57,248 --> 01:16:01,165
a voice for the gospel, to the ends of the earth.

1065
01:16:01,252 --> 01:16:09,347
By faith, we ask this in the name of Jesus, amen.

1066
01:16:09,434 --> 01:16:17,268
Billy: I hear you, lord.
It's by faith.

1067
01:16:17,355 --> 01:16:23,187
And from this moment forward,
I accept this work

1068
01:16:23,274 --> 01:16:27,147
as your infallible word.

1069
01:16:27,234 --> 01:16:32,283

what the Bible says.

T.w.: Los Angeles called
back...

1080
01:17:17,502 --> 01:17:21,332
They raised the 25,000.

1081
01:17:21,419 --> 01:17:25,423
What do I tell them?
All right.

[Instrumental music]

1083
01:17:36,173 --> 01:17:38,262
Billy: I have a friend,
a dear friend,

1084
01:17:38,349 --> 01:17:43,441
who told me Jesus was a man,
nothing but a man.

1085
01:17:43,528 --> 01:17:46,487
Well, he was a man,
he was human.

1086
01:17:46,574 --> 01:17:51,231
Now, he was not a white man,
and he was not a black man.

1087
01:17:51,318 --> 01:17:53,233
He came from that part
of the world,

1088
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:58,282
which touches Europe,
and Africa, and Asia.

1089
01:17:58,369 --> 01:18:01,415
And he probably had
a brown skin.

1090
01:18:01,502 --> 01:18:05,768
And christianity is not
a white man's religion.

1091
01:18:05,855 --> 01:18:11,164
And you don't let anybody tell
ya that it's white or black.

1092
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:15,386
So who is this strange man who
marches his way across history?

1093
01:18:15,473 --> 01:18:17,257
Who can explain him?

1094
01:18:17,344 --> 01:18:19,433
There's never been anyone else
like him.

1095
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,307
My friend, who is an atheist,
will tell ya that.

1096
01:18:23,394 --> 01:18:26,397
He only had a ministry
of three years,

1097
01:18:26,484 --> 01:18:31,402
and yet 2.000 years later,
millions upon millions,

1098
01:18:31,489 --> 01:18:36,494
on every continent, bow down
and worship him.

1099
01:18:36,581 --> 01:18:41,194
Why?
How is this possible?

1100
01:18:41,281 --> 01:18:45,546
Because he was made
to redeem US.

1101
01:18:45,633 --> 01:18:49,812
He went up onto that cross
to redeem US.

1102
01:18:49,899 --> 01:18:55,339
And on that cross, he touched
the finger of god in one hand,

1103
01:18:55,426 --> 01:18:58,516
and in the other hand,
he reached out,
and he took your hand.

1104
01:18:58,603 --> 01:19:01,432
And in that moment,
on the cross,

1105
01:19:01,519 --> 01:19:05,828
he reconciled god and man.

1106
01:19:05,915 --> 01:19:10,180
And, I'm asking you tonight,
to commit your life to him.

1107
01:19:10,267 --> 01:19:16,186
It's tough, it's hard,
and there are those
who will mock you for it,

1108
01:19:16,273 --> 01:19:19,842
but there is a joy
and a satisfaction

1109
01:19:19,929 --> 01:19:24,411
in living that kind of life,
in following him,

1110
01:19:24,498 --> 01:19:30,200
a Serenity that fills
the emptiness in your hearts.

1111
01:19:30,287 --> 01:19:34,247
And once you have it,
you know where you are going,

1112
01:19:34,334 --> 01:19:37,207
and you know where
you have come from,

1113
01:19:37,294 --> 01:19:39,470
and you know what life
is all about,

1114
01:19:39,557 --> 01:19:41,385
and you know why
you're here,

1115
01:19:41,472 --> 01:19:44,518
and where you are going
when you die.

1116
01:19:44,605 --> 01:19:49,219
Now, I am going to ask you
to get out of your seat,
wherever you are,

1117
01:19:49,306 --> 01:19:52,222
and stand in front
of this platform,

1118
01:19:52,309 --> 01:19:57,357
and say, "by coming,
I know that I am a sinner.

1119
01:19:57,444 --> 01:20:00,883
I want to receive god
into my heart.

1120
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:03,494
I want my sins forgiven.

1121
01:20:03,581 --> 01:20:06,410
I want to know that
I am going to heaven.

1122
01:20:06,497 --> 01:20:10,240
And I want a new life,
and I want it to begin
right here.

1123
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:12,242
And I want it to begin
right now."

1124
01:20:12,329 --> 01:20:15,898
And you know what?
It can.

1125
01:20:15,985 --> 01:20:17,900
I don't care if you are
a movie star,

1126
01:20:17,987 --> 01:20:21,425
or the biggest drunk walkin'
the streets of Los Angeles.

1127
01:20:21,512 --> 01:20:27,257
God is waiting for you
right now.

1128
01:20:27,344 --> 01:20:30,913
Come down...

1129
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,525
Come down and give
your life to Christ.
