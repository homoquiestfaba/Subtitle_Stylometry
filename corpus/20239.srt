1
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:13,722
Company, by the right.

2
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:20,725
Eyes right.

3
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,403
Eyes front.

4
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:14,000
I said, eyes front.

5
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:56,284
You have come here
because society has no use for you.

6
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:00,408
The prisons have given up hope
of rehabilitating you.

7
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:05,081
This place will be your holding pen
until your death, -

8
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:07,717
- because death is the only way out.

9
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:12,760
There is no chance of reprieve,
no possibility of escape.

10
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:15,763
You are condemned.

11
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,002
Either accept it, or die.

12
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:37,608
I want to see prisoner 2675.

13
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,008
201 1 , Benghazi, Libya.

14
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:56,367
You marched up to your
commanding officer and shot him.

15
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:01,284
You were convicted of
first-degree, premeditated homicide.

16
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:05,886
You have since escaped from
two maximum security prisons.

17
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:09,928
DNA scan reveaIs an
aversion to authority -

18
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:14,207
- and a temperament
prone to vioIent behaviour.

19
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:28,639
CongratuIations.
You've found a home.

20
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:31,642
I run a muItinationaI business here.

21
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:35,484
I re-process human garbage
from around the worId.

22
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:39,437
I'm good at it
because I make aII the ruIes.

23
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:42,646
You wiII have no contact
with the worId.

24
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:47,564
No visitors, no Ietters.
You're dead.

25
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:54,718
But if you break any of my ruIes,
you'II find a Iife after death.

26
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:57,801
A very painfuI Iife.

27
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:06,208
Have you anything to add?

28
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:09,839
Don't ever
turn your back on me again.

29
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:50,688
Come on.

30
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:58,922
Thanks.

31
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,084
It's for you.

32
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:05,764
Come on. Quick, quick.

33
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:09,444
Don't eat it yet, they'II find out.

34
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:13,118
They know everything.

35
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:18,602
Our eIectricaI impuIses betray us.
The ones in the brain.

36
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:21,329
They've got computers in the waIIs.

37
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:25,323
They know what we're thinking.

38
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:29,645
Don't think.

39
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:52,680
- They're coming for me. They know.
- What?

40
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,000
- They're coming for me.
- It's not you.

41
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:59,081
- They're coming to get me.
- ReIax.

42
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:02,764
They want you to think that.
They'II be back.

43
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:05,841
Where are they taking him?

44
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:11,328
- AbsoIom.
- Where?

45
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:16,280
AbsoIom. The kiIIers are kings.
Their teeth are Iike knives.

46
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:20,920
Human fIesh is tough.
They fIy from the trees ...

47
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:24,719
Ssh, ssh.

48
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:23,967
Hoarding food is a major infraction.

49
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:27,963
You are given enough to survive.
No more ...

50
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:31,083
... no Iess.

51
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:41,321
The punishment for this infraction:

52
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:47,843
Ten Iashes.

53
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:02,924
Prisoner 2675.

54
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,844
You wiII execute the punishment.

55
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:11,120
Nine more, pIease.

56
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,401
Begin.

57
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:28,286
Pick it up.

58
00:10:30,849 --> 00:10:33,409
In five seconds, he's dead.

59
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:38,120
You don't know me weII enough
to doubt me.

60
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:41,920
Now pick it up.

61
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:46,566
One ...

62
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,208
Two ...

63
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:49,768
Three ...

64
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:51,157
Four ...

65
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:53,604
Five ...

66
00:10:57,609 --> 00:10:59,247
Good.

67
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,639
Now, begin.

68
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:05,201
Stop!

69
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:15,768
T1 is over AbsoIom.
They request Ianding coordinates.

70
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:19,160
Drop him cIose to sector four.

71
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:15,599
- Prisoner 2675 has been deIivered.
- Good.

72
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:49,329
Stop!

73
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:08,247
Now put it back.

74
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,363
Good.

75
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:12,517
Isn't this beautifuI?

76
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:14,964
200 deIuxe rooms.

77
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:20,118
A heated pooI
and a staff of caring professionaIs.

78
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,680
I'm sorry, I'm being rude.

79
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:31,407
I'm WaIter Marek, the manager.
WeIcome to vacation paradise.

80
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:36,120
- I hope you take pIastic.
- We take everything.

81
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:41,647
I've scheduIed a variety
of stimuIating activities for you.

82
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:45,006
- ShuffIeboard?
- Water sports.

83
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:54,087
These activities can be rigorous, so
we're seIective about our cIienteIe.

84
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:58,322
We Iike to make sure
they meet the physicaI demands.

85
00:17:58,489 --> 00:18:01,879
To get your heart pounding,
we thought:

86
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:07,601
Five minutes in the pooI with RaIph,
our director of aquatic activities.

87
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:24,037
Enjoy.

88
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,918
That's extraordinary.

89
00:18:55,209 --> 00:18:58,724
It wasn't what we had in mind,
but ...

90
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,483
Extraordinary!

91
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,879
I can use a man Iike you
on my staff.

92
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,643
We appear to have an opening.

93
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:15,325
Think about it.
DeIuxe rooms, free meaIs:

94
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:19,603
Anyone you can catch,
kiII and eat.

95
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:24,126
- How's your heaIth pIan?
- Average Iife expectancy is ...

96
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,007
Six months?

97
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:28,729
I've been here seven years.

98
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:34,600
- What if I say no?
- That wouId be very disappointing.

99
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:40,798
If you've got to go,
I won't stand in your way.

100
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:45,247
- I couId probabIy use the exercise.
- I'II stay.

101
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:48,645
I'II stay.

102
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:54,605
If you promise
to hire another Iifeguard.

103
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:02,959
You want it?
You want it?

104
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:14,126
Get out of the way!

105
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:21,807
That was a very siIIy thing to do.

106
00:22:58,249 --> 00:23:01,082
Let him go.

107
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:45,169
Bye!

108
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:41,522
- Yes?
- A message from the island.

109
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:46,888
Prisoner 2675 is alive.
He's at the lnsiders' camp.

110
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:55,842
You don't ever go in there.
Ever!

111
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:13,966
- How are you feeIing?
- Okay.

112
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:18,162
- Do you want to sit down?
- No.

113
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:20,684
- What's your name?
- Robbins.

114
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:23,647
Mr Hawkins is our security chief.

115
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:27,722
I'm known as the Father here.

116
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:30,881
How did you escape the Outsiders?

117
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:36,639
- Why?
- How did you get past the traps?

118
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:42,401
- What is this pIace?
- A sanctuary, Mr Robbins.

119
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:46,005
Most of us came
before the Outsiders got so strong.

120
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:49,798
You're the first
to ever escape from Marek.

121
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:53,405
And you brought
a very powerfuI weapon.

122
00:27:53,569 --> 00:27:56,925
- What about that?
- It's been appropriated.

123
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:59,603
How did you get it?

124
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:04,843
I was shot, beaten, haIf-drowned.
I don't want an interrogation.

125
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:09,207
- It's not an interrogation.
- Then you do the taIking.

126
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:18,084
We've created
a new, civiIised society here.

127
00:28:18,249 --> 00:28:20,638
We're aIone on this isIand.

128
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:24,404
We have what other prisoners want:
Freedom.

129
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:27,003
The chance to make a Iife.

130
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:31,208
You are a highIy resourcefuI man.
Join us.

131
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:37,080
I'm not a joiner anymore.
I just want to get off this isIand.

132
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:39,998
Take him to Dysart.

133
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:52,565
Severe oxidation
of the firing moduIe.

134
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:55,118
Transducers require an overhauI.

135
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:59,168
CoiI, ejector rods, targeting ...
AII compIeteIy shot.

136
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:02,207
The coiI can be insuIated with siIk.

137
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:04,883
Even fIax from a corn staIk.

138
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:08,803
And the ejector rods
just need sanding.

139
00:29:08,969 --> 00:29:13,326
- You know your weapons, Mr ...
- Robbins. The new man.

140
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:18,247
- How did you get it?
- I sIept with the owner.

141
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:22,925
- Did you hear that?
- He's determined to escape.

142
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:26,081
Yes, of course.

143
00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:43,047
You're on an isIand, Mr Robbins.

144
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:47,885
It's caIIed AbsoIom, situated
200 miIes from the mainIand.

145
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:50,688
There's no guards, no ceIIs.

146
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:55,320
We're on a peninsuIa.
Beyond those trees is the ocean.

147
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:59,323
The jungIe side is heaviIy defended.
You know why.

148
00:29:59,489 --> 00:30:03,482
The Outsiders.
We think there are about 600.

149
00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:07,483
There are preciseIy 98 of us.

150
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:13,759
The isIand is watched by sateIIites
with infra-red scanners.

151
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:16,478
Any escape wiII be detected.

152
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:20,164
There's a fIeet of heIicopters
50 miIes away.

153
00:30:20,329 --> 00:30:23,560
They can be here in minutes.

154
00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:27,847
- And you caII this freedom?
- Under the circumstances.

155
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:31,047
We use the term IooseIy.

156
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:35,805
I'm sorry, but you're here
for the rest of your Iife.

157
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:40,326
You can't go anywhere with that Ieg.
You've time to think.

158
00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:43,879
You either stay here
and do your share, -

159
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:47,485
- or take your chances out there.

160
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:52,604
Your feet!
Wipe your feet.

161
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:57,081
The average maIe foot
has over 600 miIIion germs.

162
00:30:57,249 --> 00:31:01,128
Wow!
So we're taIking 1 .2 biIIion?

163
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:06,602
There's nothing funny about sinus
infections, bronchitis or pink eye.

164
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:11,684
There's no antibiotics here,
no peniciIIin.

165
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:16,127
A bad case of pink eye,
and you're history.

166
00:31:16,289 --> 00:31:18,883
Okay, I'II remember that.

167
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:25,478
- Who are you?
- Tom King. I host the newcomers.

168
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:28,641
Everything you need
is in that drawer.

169
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:33,837
I suggest an oraI hygiene programme.
Trench mouth is rampant.

170
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:39,720
Wash your face before shaving.
A "staph" infection couId kiII.

171
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:43,928
The Father sent over some saIve
for your Ieg.

172
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:46,205
Nasty.

173
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:51,682
- Why do they caII him the Father?
- That's what he is, to us.

174
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:57,159
It must be the dust.

175
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:22,445
- Why are you foIIowing me?
- You frightened me.

176
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:27,160
- Why are you foIIowing me?
- I was just ...

177
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:33,080
I heard you escaped from Marek.
I wanted to meet the badass ...

178
00:32:33,329 --> 00:32:36,241
- Don't.
- Sure. Sorry.

179
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:39,601
Hey, I understand.

180
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:42,681
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

181
00:32:42,849 --> 00:32:47,969
- Just Ieave me aIone, okay?
- AbsoIuteIy.

182
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:03,039
Wet Dreams!

183
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:08,967
That's what I caII this pIace.
Wet Dreams.

184
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:16,568
I come here and think about home.
Newark.

185
00:34:16,729 --> 00:34:20,244
It's about 5,000 miIes that way.

186
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:24,482
I thought it was a sIum
but now I'd kiss the gutters.

187
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:30,007
- Then start swimming.
- I've got a probIem with sharks.

188
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:34,968
I've got the same thing with rats.

189
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,439
Wait.

190
00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:51,319
Stephano.

191
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:55,319
My friend, Mr Robbins.
Don't touch him.

192
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:59,482
This is Stephano.
Anything you need, he's got it.

193
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:02,004
I Iike the boots.

194
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:08,039
Sign them to me for merchandise.
When you die, they're mine. Okay?

195
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:13,800
He does that with everyone.

196
00:35:13,969 --> 00:35:16,085
What merchandise do you have?

197
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:19,924
I have two dozen potatoes,
very few bruises.

198
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:24,605
I've five pairs of underwear.
Size 44. "Fruit of the Loom".

199
00:35:25,169 --> 00:35:30,562
Okay ...
I've got 1 4 disposabIe razors.

200
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:35,484
They're pink,
but who gives a shit, right?

201
00:35:35,649 --> 00:35:38,482
Are you a baII pIayer?

202
00:35:38,649 --> 00:35:43,040
I've got a first baseman's mitt.
Are you a righty?

203
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:48,480
- I'm trying to do business!
- I found some rubber.

204
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:50,640
I'm overwheImed.
Here ...

205
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:53,164
Take my sack ...

206
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:56,924
Bring it up the cIiff,
and quit bothering me.

207
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:01,322
I want this mitt.

208
00:36:01,489 --> 00:36:04,845
Come back.
I must have something you want!

209
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:07,125
Have you got a boat?

210
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:10,645
A boat ..?

211
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:12,925
I Iove those boots.

212
00:37:50,689 --> 00:37:54,921
What are you doing?
No one goes out at night.

213
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:59,241
- I don't take orders anymore.
- We're aII Iifers here.

214
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:02,242
We have our own ruIes.

215
00:38:02,409 --> 00:38:07,881
You couId have been an Outsider.
You're Iucky I didn't kiII you.

216
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:17,003
You think I'm Iucky?

217
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,127
Count your bIessings.

218
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:26,604
You know what I want.
Don't be shy with that.

219
00:38:35,529 --> 00:38:39,078
This is my
absoIute goddamn favourite.

220
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:48,287
- Good, ain't it?
- Yeah, if you Iike road kiII.

221
00:38:48,569 --> 00:38:51,561
It's not for everyone.

222
00:38:54,729 --> 00:39:01,646
- Why were you sent here, Casey?
- The Weinburger kidnapping.

223
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:08,124
You did that?

224
00:39:09,529 --> 00:39:14,808
I was a gopher. Drove the car,
went for coffee, fed the kids.

225
00:39:16,409 --> 00:39:20,607
They were in a cIoset.
I toId the boss there was no air.

226
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:25,206
But he had a miIIion doIIars
on the brain.

227
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:32,118
I wouIdn't have hurt them. I had
a brother and sister their age.

228
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:43,000
SuppIy drop.

229
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:48,039
- What?
- SuppIy drop. For the Outsiders.

230
00:39:48,649 --> 00:39:52,403
- How often do they come?
- Twice a month.

231
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:55,129
Forget about jumping that chopper.

232
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:59,282
They pick a new spot each time.
And who'd fIy it?

233
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:02,486
- Most of us can't even read.
- I can.

234
00:40:02,649 --> 00:40:06,198
- FIy a chopper?
- No, read.

235
00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:09,886
Mr Robbins,
it's time I bought you a drink.

236
00:40:18,169 --> 00:40:24,085
- KiIIian? Two shots of 1 2-day-oId.
- Piss off!

237
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:29,766
Mr Robbins is new in town.
Give us a IittIe taste.

238
00:40:39,249 --> 00:40:42,605
Down the hatch.

239
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:54,766
Brain spasm.
It took me years to get that effect.

240
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:58,485
- This stuff wiII kiII you.
- What?

241
00:40:58,649 --> 00:41:03,245
- You caII my Iife's work shit?
- It's turpentine.

242
00:41:03,409 --> 00:41:09,086
Bastard! I can whip your ass
with onIy one arm, you know.

243
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:15,324
Anybody who can make nectar Iike
this, I wouIdn't want to mess with.

244
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:25,121
We've got to go to the gate.
Everyone must go to the gate.

245
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:49,848
- What's going on?
- He feII asIeep at his post.

246
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:53,160
He was warned.
It's the second time.

247
00:42:00,969 --> 00:42:05,440
The ruIes are there
to protect the community.

248
00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:12,561
Any man who jeopardises
the Iives of any or aII among us -

249
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:15,562
- commits a capitaI offence.

250
00:42:15,729 --> 00:42:19,165
The penaIty is banishment.

251
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:54,687
You don't approve?

252
00:42:54,849 --> 00:42:59,001
- Do you need my approvaI?
- He broke the ruIes.

253
00:42:59,169 --> 00:43:04,448
And he'II die because of the ruIes.
Innocent peopIe aIways do.

254
00:43:05,409 --> 00:43:08,526
They die for somebody eIse's ruIes.

255
00:43:08,729 --> 00:43:11,721
We Iive under constant threat.

256
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:17,566
That man couId have cost us our
Iives. We must do this to survive.

257
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:23,281
How Iong can you stay awake
without somebody guarding you?

258
00:44:01,129 --> 00:44:03,199
What's the probIem?

259
00:44:03,369 --> 00:44:07,806
- Where's the food?
- You'II get it when I say.

260
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:14,528
Tomorrow, if you behave.

261
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:21,797
We're sick of obeying you.
Someone eIse shouId give the orders.

262
00:44:22,249 --> 00:44:25,525
ReaIIy?
Do you have anyone in mind?

263
00:44:25,689 --> 00:44:29,398
What about the con who stoIe the gun
and gave you a bath?

264
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:33,164
Maybe we shouId ask him.

265
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:37,159
That's not funny.

266
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:53,326
Now that's funny!

267
00:45:04,929 --> 00:45:09,878
- They'II tear each other to pieces.
- We'II make a raid.

268
00:45:10,049 --> 00:45:15,999
That won't work anymore. We need
the Iand, the food, everything.

269
00:45:16,169 --> 00:45:21,482
- We'II need the other gangs.
- Maybe there's another way.

270
00:45:22,529 --> 00:45:26,238
Maybe we shouId
just make it personaI.

271
00:45:26,409 --> 00:45:29,446
Just me and Dad.

272
00:46:08,729 --> 00:46:10,959
Robbins!

273
00:46:11,889 --> 00:46:16,201
Merry Christmas!
I made you a hat.

274
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:21,443
You don't have to wear it.
It's a Christmas party, come on.

275
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:23,884
Excuse me.

276
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:30,244
Quiet pIease.

277
00:46:30,409 --> 00:46:33,321
WiII you be quiet!

278
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:40,442
Mr Dysart ...

279
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,887
Here we go.

280
00:46:52,569 --> 00:46:55,367
Thank you. A IoveIy tree.

281
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:10,841
You want to go caroIIing?

282
00:47:20,529 --> 00:47:25,649
UncIe Stephano
has a present for one and aII.

283
00:47:29,009 --> 00:47:32,524
These IittIe suckers.

284
00:47:32,689 --> 00:47:36,284
These morseIs of technoIogy
washed up here, -

285
00:47:36,449 --> 00:47:40,727
- and they're as good as
the day they were made.

286
00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:44,405
Let me demonstrate.

287
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,883
GentIemen ...

288
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:54,961
Come and get it!

289
00:48:13,529 --> 00:48:18,364
Look ...
For the Iong coId nights ahead.

290
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:23,639
I won't be needing it.
But thank you.

291
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:31,762
Turn it down.

292
00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:44,282
Another year has passed.

293
00:48:44,449 --> 00:48:48,647
The first, for some.
For others, just one more.

294
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:53,325
No path here is ever the same,
but we aII share something -

295
00:48:53,489 --> 00:48:56,162
- that cannot be taken away.

296
00:48:56,329 --> 00:49:01,278
We have proved to ourseIves
that we cannot be written off.

297
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:04,759
That our Iives mean something.

298
00:49:04,929 --> 00:49:08,638
We are not animaIs,
we are human beings.

299
00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:13,041
That's our reprieve.
That's our pardon.

300
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:17,523
That's our freedom.

301
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:20,362
Merry Christmas, everyone.

302
00:49:20,529 --> 00:49:23,248
Now l have a toast.

303
00:49:23,409 --> 00:49:29,359
To aII our victims.
May they rest in peace.

304
00:49:51,169 --> 00:49:55,048
- So you're Ieaving us?
- At daybreak.

305
00:49:55,209 --> 00:50:00,237
- How far do you think you'II get?
- I'II figure something out.

306
00:50:00,409 --> 00:50:04,641
I don't have aII the answers,
but here there's heIp.

307
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:09,246
You can have purpose.
You can even have friends.

308
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:12,958
Most peopIe wouId caII that a Iife.

309
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:19,082
- I don't want a Iife with you.
- What made you Iike this?

310
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:25,006
We're aII guiIty in someone's eyes,
especiaIIy our own.

311
00:50:25,169 --> 00:50:28,878
EventuaIIy,
you'II have to forgive yourseIf, -

312
00:50:29,049 --> 00:50:32,678
- or you won't survive.

313
00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:38,200
Good Iuck, Mr Robbins.

314
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:11,247
- What's going on?
- The Outsiders are going to attack.

315
00:51:12,609 --> 00:51:14,918
Let's go, move it!

316
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:21,720
- What happened?
- Somebody tipped him off.

317
00:51:21,889 --> 00:51:25,325
It doesn't matter,
stick with the pIan.

318
00:51:27,249 --> 00:51:30,798
- Mr Robbins ...
- What do you want, Casey?

319
00:51:30,969 --> 00:51:35,679
- Can you stand with me on the waII?
- Get out ... Get out!

320
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:45,678
- There was a signaI?
- We have a spy in their camp.

321
00:53:14,449 --> 00:53:20,922
Robbins ... Do you beIieve there's
a God up there Iooking out for us?

322
00:53:21,809 --> 00:53:25,768
There's something up there,
but it's not God.

323
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:50,360
Sir, a strike force
are at the viIIage perimeter.

324
00:53:52,489 --> 00:53:55,287
What the heII are they waiting for?

325
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:20,486
Down!

326
00:54:29,929 --> 00:54:32,124
It's started.

327
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:36,726
- Any thermaI activity?
- Nothing that a sateIIite can see.

328
00:54:36,889 --> 00:54:40,962
- You're sure?
- It'II take more heat than that.

329
00:54:41,129 --> 00:54:45,998
- Choppers on aIert, sir?
- No. Let them fight it out.

330
00:54:56,969 --> 00:55:00,598
Water! Water!

331
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,968
There you go, guys ...

332
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:30,159
Excuse me ...

333
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:52,158
Get him out of here.

334
00:58:59,249 --> 00:59:03,367
I wish you a merry Christmas ...

335
00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:09,239
... and a happy New Year.

336
00:59:12,889 --> 00:59:15,881
It's been a Iong time, Dad.

337
00:59:16,049 --> 00:59:20,964
You've done well for yourself.
l'm very impressed.

338
00:59:21,129 --> 00:59:24,280
Really nice place you have here.

339
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:29,963
Just a stone's throw from the ocean.

340
00:59:30,129 --> 00:59:35,249
Mind you, with the price of
reaI estate, you are very Iucky.

341
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:38,924
I mean, this is a prime site.

342
00:59:39,089 --> 00:59:42,479
I got to teII you,
your security sucks.

343
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:47,964
Look at this! This is great.

344
00:59:49,449 --> 00:59:52,441
I reaIIy get behind on my reading.

345
00:59:52,609 --> 00:59:56,238
l never seem to have enough time.

346
00:59:58,129 --> 01:00:04,398
I've aIways wanted to read this:
"Basket Weaving. A Creative Choice."

347
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:10,318
Now I'm going to kiII you.

348
01:00:19,809 --> 01:00:24,007
If I'd known you were here,
I wouId have knocked.

349
01:00:55,329 --> 01:00:57,797
Ratman!

350
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,968
Shit ...

351
01:01:28,089 --> 01:01:31,240
- Are you aII right?
- Yeah.

352
01:01:31,409 --> 01:01:35,402
Thanks a Iot.
I don't know what happened.

353
01:01:35,569 --> 01:01:41,087
- I had him in my sights ...
- It's okay.

354
01:01:49,729 --> 01:01:54,280
They do this severaI times a year
to steaI our food.

355
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:59,762
- He was coming for you.
- Maybe Marek's Iosing patience.

356
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:05,049
If he ever gets organised,
he'II bury you and this pIace.

357
01:02:05,569 --> 01:02:10,927
That's our probIem,
not yours, Mr Robbins. Isn't it?

358
01:02:12,769 --> 01:02:15,727
He's miIitary trained.

359
01:02:15,889 --> 01:02:20,917
Not just as a soIdier. Navy SEAL,
SpeciaI Forces, take your pick.

360
01:02:21,089 --> 01:02:24,843
Somebody taught him how to kiII.

361
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:57,688
The men we honour tonight
fought braveIy and died for us.

362
01:02:57,849 --> 01:03:01,364
And though they have
given everything, -

363
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:05,807
- we must not pity them.
Their pain is gone.

364
01:03:05,969 --> 01:03:09,166
Now, at Iast, their souIs are free.

365
01:03:09,329 --> 01:03:15,564
When we Iack the fruits
of their Iabours, we wiII miss them.

366
01:04:27,249 --> 01:04:30,002
Here.

367
01:04:32,889 --> 01:04:39,727
- Why did they Iet this happen?
- The warden wants us to fight.

368
01:04:41,369 --> 01:04:46,318
- Why?
- Because he can do as he pIeases.

369
01:04:47,649 --> 01:04:52,518
You don't understand.
This pIace is secret, it's private.

370
01:04:52,689 --> 01:04:57,558
The authorities keep it cIassified.
No one knows it exists.

371
01:04:57,729 --> 01:05:01,642
If it Ieaked out,
the pubIic wouIdn't aIIow it.

372
01:05:01,809 --> 01:05:05,597
That's why they make sure
no one escapes.

373
01:05:05,849 --> 01:05:09,398
As my oId CathoIic mother
used to say:

374
01:05:09,569 --> 01:05:15,041
"AIas, for our sins we shaII pay."

375
01:05:15,969 --> 01:05:21,282
- What sins is he paying for?
- Ask him yourseIf.

376
01:05:21,809 --> 01:05:25,848
He gave us our Iives back.

377
01:05:26,249 --> 01:05:30,322
He was a surgeon.
He stiII is a damn good one.

378
01:05:30,489 --> 01:05:35,358
He had Iots of money
and a young, beautifuI wife.

379
01:05:35,529 --> 01:05:39,363
But she got bored
and started sIeeping around.

380
01:05:39,529 --> 01:05:42,248
That tore him up inside.

381
01:05:42,409 --> 01:05:45,367
One day she died of an overdose.

382
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:51,047
He cIaimed it was suicide,
but the jury didn't beIieve him.

383
01:05:51,209 --> 01:05:54,485
They gave him Iife.

384
01:05:54,649 --> 01:06:01,725
- Do you think he did it?
- He's the onIy innocent man here.

385
01:06:47,449 --> 01:06:51,442
You Iiar!
AII this crap about a new society.

386
01:06:51,609 --> 01:06:54,169
You've been pIanning to escape.

387
01:06:54,329 --> 01:06:57,048
How much further, Mr Dysart?

388
01:06:57,449 --> 01:07:00,327
It's 2,000 metres.

389
01:07:01,489 --> 01:07:05,368
- Why don't they stop it?
- It's a speciaI craft.

390
01:07:05,529 --> 01:07:10,000
It can evade their sensors.
It has a cooIing system.

391
01:07:10,169 --> 01:07:13,445
- They can't see it?
- We don't know yet.

392
01:07:13,609 --> 01:07:16,681
There's a five-miIe
surveiIIance circIe.

393
01:07:16,849 --> 01:07:19,317
They haven't crossed it yet.

394
01:07:34,329 --> 01:07:37,002
What have you got?

395
01:07:37,609 --> 01:07:41,807
The warden's dry cIeaning.
Main gate, open it up.

396
01:07:52,289 --> 01:07:54,962
1 ,000 metres.

397
01:08:07,449 --> 01:08:11,283
- 500 metres.
- It's going to make it.

398
01:08:30,049 --> 01:08:33,166
Warden. Message from the isIand.
Code seven.

399
01:08:35,129 --> 01:08:39,281
- It's out.
- It's got to be!

400
01:09:13,089 --> 01:09:15,523
Come on, move!

401
01:09:35,489 --> 01:09:38,606
Are you aII right?

402
01:09:55,449 --> 01:09:59,362
- Maybe the cooIing system faiIed.
- That's buIIshit.

403
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:02,487
They were tipped off.

404
01:10:02,649 --> 01:10:07,086
The warden's pIanted someone.
That's why we're so cautious.

405
01:10:07,249 --> 01:10:10,844
- You couId have been a spy.
- You're in charge of security.

406
01:10:11,009 --> 01:10:14,604
- What the heII do you mean?
- They're gone.

407
01:10:16,889 --> 01:10:19,642
- We can't do anything.
- Who were they?

408
01:10:19,809 --> 01:10:24,837
You don't know them.
They were in the caves for months.

409
01:10:25,449 --> 01:10:27,838
Good men.

410
01:10:28,009 --> 01:10:32,605
- I want to be on the next boat.
- Who do you think you are?

411
01:10:32,769 --> 01:10:37,445
Those men worked hard for years.
You ain't done shit.

412
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:40,601
He's right.
You haven't earned it.

413
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:43,158
Not yet.

414
01:11:11,529 --> 01:11:15,727
You don't waste time,
do you, Dysart?

415
01:11:16,129 --> 01:11:21,522
The components are made here
and then assembIed in the cave.

416
01:11:21,689 --> 01:11:24,601
Is this the one you'II be on?

417
01:11:25,129 --> 01:11:28,724
No, Mr Robbins. I won't be Ieaving.

418
01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:35,280
30 years ago, I used my taIents
to make a very powerfuI bomb.

419
01:11:35,449 --> 01:11:37,963
For money.

420
01:11:38,129 --> 01:11:43,840
I didn't beIieve in the cause,
I just wanted the money.

421
01:11:44,009 --> 01:11:47,365
50 peopIe died.

422
01:11:47,529 --> 01:11:51,727
Now I'm right where I beIong.

423
01:11:59,329 --> 01:12:01,923
What's this?

424
01:12:04,929 --> 01:12:08,205
We've been working on
a power source.

425
01:12:08,369 --> 01:12:11,361
Power source, my ass!
This is a V8.

426
01:12:11,529 --> 01:12:15,204
Yes, that's right.
From an oId Chevy.

427
01:12:15,369 --> 01:12:23,162
TheoreticaIIy, it can propeI a craft
through the surveiIIance circIe.

428
01:12:23,329 --> 01:12:27,117
- UnfortunateIy, it's useIess.
- Why?

429
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:29,883
We're missing a vitaI component.

430
01:12:30,049 --> 01:12:35,123
- It requires a device ...
- A distributor.

431
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:40,041
Yes, a simpIe, ordinary,
garden-variety distributor.

432
01:12:40,409 --> 01:12:43,481
Found in any auto store
in the worId.

433
01:12:43,649 --> 01:12:48,006
The probIem is, Mr Robbins,
we're not in the worId.

434
01:12:52,409 --> 01:12:56,687
- I want to be on the next boat.
- We've discussed that.

435
01:12:56,849 --> 01:13:00,762
Your engine is missing something,
right?

436
01:13:00,929 --> 01:13:04,478
I've seen what you're Iooking for
in Marek's camp.

437
01:13:04,649 --> 01:13:08,198
- You'II trade that for a space?
- AIong with Casey.

438
01:13:08,369 --> 01:13:11,679
He doesn't beIong here.

439
01:13:11,849 --> 01:13:17,287
You know there's aImost no chance
of you returning aIive.

440
01:13:17,449 --> 01:13:21,886
- That's my probIem.
- There's something you shouId know.

441
01:13:22,049 --> 01:13:28,204
- Those who escape get the word out.
- And risk getting sent back?

442
01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:33,124
We have a responsibiIity
to bIow this pIace wide open.

443
01:13:33,969 --> 01:13:37,359
The boat is the onIy way
to get us aII off.

444
01:13:37,529 --> 01:13:42,319
You've heard my deaI, no conditions.
Take it or Ieave it.

445
01:14:00,329 --> 01:14:05,562
- So you're going back to Marek's?
- How the heII did you find out?

446
01:14:05,729 --> 01:14:08,289
It's a smaII town.

447
01:14:08,449 --> 01:14:11,759
You've got baIIs,
I'II give you that.

448
01:14:11,929 --> 01:14:18,448
But the smart money says Marek
wiII be pIaying jacks with them.

449
01:14:18,609 --> 01:14:21,442
No, you can't have my shoes.

450
01:14:21,609 --> 01:14:25,841
Wait. I'm shocked
that you think that's why I came.

451
01:14:26,009 --> 01:14:30,082
You need those shoes.
You'II be doing a Iot of running.

452
01:14:30,249 --> 01:14:37,724
A tough guy Iike you wiII probabIy
get back wounded and die here.

453
01:14:37,889 --> 01:14:40,119
- You know what wiII happen?
- No.

454
01:14:40,289 --> 01:14:43,884
Everybody wiII be fighting
over those shoes.

455
01:14:44,049 --> 01:14:49,328
- It wiII disrupt the whoIe viIIage.
- You want me to sign a contract?

456
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:52,879
- Just initiaI the page ...
- Get out!

457
01:14:53,289 --> 01:14:56,486
We'II make it a verbaI agreement.

458
01:14:56,809 --> 01:14:59,687
- I'II find a witness.
- Out!

459
01:15:08,049 --> 01:15:12,918
I've charted the safest route.
FoIIow the river to the faIIs.

460
01:15:13,089 --> 01:15:16,126
Then Marek's camp is just east.

461
01:15:18,609 --> 01:15:21,487
An exampIe of an oIder technoIogy.

462
01:15:21,649 --> 01:15:24,641
Invented by Sergei MoIotov,
Iong ago.

463
01:15:24,809 --> 01:15:29,246
The originaI instructions are:
Light it and throw it.

464
01:15:29,409 --> 01:15:31,923
Great, thanks.

465
01:15:33,569 --> 01:15:36,129
Good Iuck.

466
01:15:48,609 --> 01:15:50,725
Mr Robbins!

467
01:15:50,889 --> 01:15:54,006
- Casey ...
- I want to come with you.

468
01:15:54,169 --> 01:15:57,241
- PIease take me.
- Casey, go home.

469
01:15:57,409 --> 01:16:01,766
I can heIp you.
I thought you were my friend!

470
01:16:01,929 --> 01:16:06,639
Have you ever kiIIed anyone, Casey?

471
01:16:06,809 --> 01:16:11,883
I'm going to have to kiII.
No hesitation, no conscience.

472
01:16:12,049 --> 01:16:14,847
After that, you're never the same.

473
01:16:15,009 --> 01:16:20,527
- You're Iucky you can't do it.
- You won't come back.

474
01:16:22,849 --> 01:16:28,481
Casey. Who's the guy who
went up against Marek and Iived?

475
01:16:28,649 --> 01:16:31,402
- You did.
- That's right.

476
01:16:31,569 --> 01:16:35,244
And I'm going to do it again.

477
01:16:35,489 --> 01:16:41,598
You're Iooking for a friend?
I'm the best friend you ever had.

478
01:16:46,369 --> 01:16:49,645
Now go back.
Go.

479
01:16:49,809 --> 01:16:52,482
Go.

480
01:17:39,609 --> 01:17:44,683
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I've been a IittIe preoccupied.

481
01:17:44,849 --> 01:17:50,321
Now ... I think it's about time
we patched up our differences.

482
01:17:50,489 --> 01:17:56,246
If anyone disagrees with me,
pIease raise your right hand.

483
01:17:56,569 --> 01:17:59,481
If you've got one.

484
01:17:59,649 --> 01:18:03,642
No?
Good. Very good.

485
01:18:09,569 --> 01:18:13,198
As you see,
I've eIiminated the heads of state.

486
01:18:13,369 --> 01:18:17,282
So from now on,
we'II aII be nice and civiIised.

487
01:18:17,449 --> 01:18:20,998
No more gangs,
petty squabbIes or fighting.

488
01:18:22,889 --> 01:18:26,040
I've been under a Iot of stress.

489
01:18:26,209 --> 01:18:29,724
The reason for this is very simpIe:

490
01:18:31,129 --> 01:18:34,519
I reaIIy want to be in charge.

491
01:18:34,689 --> 01:18:37,283
Okay?

492
01:18:37,729 --> 01:18:40,641
Good.

493
01:19:26,169 --> 01:19:28,524
No!

494
01:20:14,249 --> 01:20:18,003
My! You're just a boy.

495
01:20:18,169 --> 01:20:22,720
A sweet, tender,
adorabIe IittIe boy.

496
01:20:29,289 --> 01:20:31,325
Tie him up.

497
01:20:31,489 --> 01:20:35,721
And I don't want him bruised.

498
01:21:05,369 --> 01:21:11,808
And sIowIy, very sIowIy, they
cIimbed up to the top of the stairs.

499
01:21:11,969 --> 01:21:16,963
Then the three bears found
a boy sIeeping in their bed.

500
01:21:17,129 --> 01:21:20,166
And they aII said,
"Who can this be?"

501
01:21:20,329 --> 01:21:25,119
The IittIe boy didn't answer,
so the big daddy bear ...

502
01:21:25,409 --> 01:21:28,560
... ripped his arm off.

503
01:22:10,289 --> 01:22:16,080
You are so cute. You're far too
young to be out here on your own.

504
01:22:16,249 --> 01:22:20,242
Where are your other IittIe friends?
WiII they come by?

505
01:22:20,409 --> 01:22:23,606
Don't be shy, teII UncIe WaIter.

506
01:22:23,769 --> 01:22:26,727
Fuck you.

507
01:23:35,729 --> 01:23:38,801
Bonjour. Guten Tag.

508
01:23:38,969 --> 01:23:40,322
WeIcome.

509
01:23:44,489 --> 01:23:47,208
Same game as before, my friend.

510
01:23:47,369 --> 01:23:51,601
But this time with a IittIe twist.
You'II Iove it.

511
01:24:01,049 --> 01:24:04,598
First prize is a chance to Iive.
Second prize ...

512
01:24:04,769 --> 01:24:07,203
You reaIIy don't want to know.

513
01:24:07,369 --> 01:24:11,044
Don't disappoint us.
We've paid to see a show.

514
01:24:11,209 --> 01:24:14,724
If you refuse to fight,
it'II be boring, -

515
01:24:14,889 --> 01:24:18,928
- and then I'II have to
jump in and kiII you both.

516
01:24:25,649 --> 01:24:28,402
Now!

517
01:24:37,809 --> 01:24:40,960
Go on!

518
01:24:58,289 --> 01:25:01,406
You have to kiII me.
I'II never get out of here.

519
01:25:01,569 --> 01:25:03,685
You can save them.

520
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:06,647
Do it!

521
01:25:11,969 --> 01:25:14,722
No ...

522
01:25:42,009 --> 01:25:45,888
I'm reaIIy trying to retain
my faith in humanity, -

523
01:25:46,049 --> 01:25:50,281
- but you are making it
very difficuIt.

524
01:25:50,449 --> 01:25:53,964
I weIcomed you,
I treated you with respect.

525
01:25:54,129 --> 01:25:57,360
I even offered you a position.

526
01:25:57,529 --> 01:26:02,239
And what did you do?
You made a horse's ass out of me!

527
01:26:02,649 --> 01:26:05,925
I hate it when that happens.

528
01:26:06,089 --> 01:26:10,367
What were you trying to do?
Were you trying to kiII me?

529
01:26:10,529 --> 01:26:13,839
You reaIIy thought
you couId kiII me?

530
01:26:14,129 --> 01:26:17,087
Shame about the boy.

531
01:26:17,249 --> 01:26:19,922
But nothing goes to waste here.

532
01:26:20,089 --> 01:26:24,879
I'II have a dinner party
and share him with my friends.

533
01:26:25,049 --> 01:26:29,042
You're going to die
very, very badIy.

534
01:26:57,569 --> 01:27:00,845
Marek's united aII the gangs
for an attack.

535
01:27:01,009 --> 01:27:04,843
You must warn them.
I'II signaI when they march.

536
01:27:05,009 --> 01:27:07,887
Why are you doing this?

537
01:27:08,049 --> 01:27:10,768
Redemption.

538
01:27:10,929 --> 01:27:14,046
Now, go!

539
01:27:39,089 --> 01:27:41,887
Dysart!

540
01:27:44,369 --> 01:27:49,887
One distributor.
Make it work.

541
01:28:05,769 --> 01:28:09,444
The Father feII iII
soon after you Ieft.

542
01:28:09,609 --> 01:28:14,478
- The men are worried.
- Marek's going to attack.

543
01:28:14,649 --> 01:28:20,804
We must fortify the barrier
and the towers, and dig a moat.

544
01:28:20,969 --> 01:28:25,406
What about some mantraps
just outside the barrier?

545
01:28:25,569 --> 01:28:29,767
We can fiII the moat with fueI.
Mr KiIIian can provide it.

546
01:28:29,929 --> 01:28:34,639
- I'II doubIe production right away.
- And more weapons.

547
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:39,519
TeII your men we'II need
aII the metaI we can find.

548
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:42,487
Mr Robbins?

549
01:28:43,889 --> 01:28:48,519
We're outnumbered six to one.
Marek's united aII the gangs.

550
01:28:48,689 --> 01:28:51,886
If he wants this pIace,
we can't stop him.

551
01:28:52,049 --> 01:28:56,998
- If we stay here he'II kiII us aII.
- What are you saying?

552
01:28:57,449 --> 01:29:03,399
- We abandon the viIIage?
- I'm just teIIing you the facts.

553
01:29:03,569 --> 01:29:08,359
He wants us to give up aII that
we've worked for for 1 3 years.

554
01:29:08,529 --> 01:29:12,078
- I won't do it without a fight.
- He's right.

555
01:29:12,249 --> 01:29:16,720
Why fooI ourseIves?
We've aIways been about survivaI.

556
01:29:16,889 --> 01:29:21,087
Whatever it takes.
It's the onIy way.

557
01:29:22,449 --> 01:29:28,797
- Make preparations to Ieave.
- What are you taIking about?

558
01:29:28,969 --> 01:29:32,120
Do it!

559
01:29:42,049 --> 01:29:44,324
Mr Robbins ...

560
01:29:44,489 --> 01:29:47,447
Did Casey foIIow you?

561
01:29:47,609 --> 01:29:50,806
What happened?

562
01:29:53,009 --> 01:29:56,968
I'm sorry.

563
01:30:00,209 --> 01:30:02,564
Dysart.

564
01:30:02,729 --> 01:30:05,402
- Is the boat ready?
- AImost.

565
01:30:05,569 --> 01:30:09,881
- Finish it.
- What for?

566
01:30:37,889 --> 01:30:43,282
I've been here for 1 3 years.
From the beginning.

567
01:30:43,449 --> 01:30:49,001
I heIped buiId this pIace
with my sweat and my heart, -

568
01:30:49,169 --> 01:30:54,243
- and I've watched a Iot of good men
die defending it.

569
01:30:54,729 --> 01:30:59,962
And I saw, for the first time
in my Iife, what a home couId be.

570
01:31:02,489 --> 01:31:05,322
I can't just waIk out on it.

571
01:31:05,489 --> 01:31:11,678
I can't just hand it over
with nobody here to stop them.

572
01:31:15,329 --> 01:31:20,278
Who said no one's going to be here?

573
01:31:46,569 --> 01:31:50,687
- You said you were getting better.
- That was a Iie.

574
01:31:52,369 --> 01:31:54,644
I'm dying.

575
01:31:54,809 --> 01:31:58,404
I have Hodgkin's disease.
It's progressive.

576
01:31:58,569 --> 01:32:02,244
Without proper treatment, IethaI.

577
01:32:02,409 --> 01:32:05,003
PIease ...

578
01:32:15,169 --> 01:32:22,166
- Does anyone eIse know?
- They'II know soon enough.

579
01:32:22,329 --> 01:32:25,685
But for now, you're the onIy one.

580
01:32:25,969 --> 01:32:29,848
I have a month Ieft, maybe two.

581
01:32:30,009 --> 01:32:36,323
But before I go, there's
an important matter to be settIed.

582
01:32:37,849 --> 01:32:42,764
- I want you to take my pIace.
- What?

583
01:32:42,929 --> 01:32:47,002
The men respect you.
You're a naturaI Ieader.

584
01:32:47,169 --> 01:32:49,285
No.

585
01:32:49,449 --> 01:32:52,998
- Then they don't stand a chance.
- That's not my probIem.

586
01:32:53,169 --> 01:32:56,764
It has to be you.

587
01:32:56,929 --> 01:33:00,808
I didn't risk my Iife with Marek
to stay here.

588
01:33:00,969 --> 01:33:06,885
- I have to get off this isIand.
- No one teIIs you what to do?

589
01:33:07,049 --> 01:33:12,362
You were a soIdier.
You must have fought for something.

590
01:33:16,809 --> 01:33:22,805
Look ... I'II take care of Marek.
For my own reasons.

591
01:33:22,969 --> 01:33:28,646
- After that, I'm gone.
- Why? You can't change your past.

592
01:33:28,809 --> 01:33:32,279
That's easy for you to say,
isn't it?

593
01:33:32,449 --> 01:33:37,443
- You have no bIood on your hands.
- What makes you so sure?

594
01:33:38,489 --> 01:33:42,607
I know what they think.

595
01:33:42,809 --> 01:33:45,164
It doesn't matter.

596
01:33:45,329 --> 01:33:49,447
My wife's death was no suicide.

597
01:33:51,289 --> 01:33:56,682
If you go, take my journaI.
It teIIs the truth about this pIace.

598
01:33:56,849 --> 01:34:01,286
Give it to someone
who wiII save these peopIe.

599
01:34:40,649 --> 01:34:43,117
Let's give it a try.

600
01:35:27,569 --> 01:35:29,878
Mr Robbins?

601
01:35:31,289 --> 01:35:34,406
Mr Robbins.

602
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:59,128
I Ied a heIicopter assauIt
on a viIIage.

603
01:35:59,289 --> 01:36:04,363
It was supposed to be
the source of bio-weapons fire.

604
01:36:05,209 --> 01:36:08,599
I shouId have known better.

605
01:36:08,769 --> 01:36:12,728
I had a Iot of combat time,
so I shouId have known.

606
01:36:12,889 --> 01:36:15,847
It was too easy.

607
01:36:16,009 --> 01:36:21,163
There was no radar,
no air defence.

608
01:36:21,329 --> 01:36:27,848
I kept teIIing him,
but he ordered us in anyway.

609
01:36:28,089 --> 01:36:32,605
And God heIp me,
I aIways foIIowed orders.

610
01:36:32,769 --> 01:36:35,488
I vaporised the pIace.

611
01:36:36,849 --> 01:36:41,400
342 women and chiIdren.

612
01:36:43,249 --> 01:36:46,798
And they covered it up.

613
01:36:46,969 --> 01:36:51,485
We were Iosing the war.
They needed a big body count.

614
01:36:51,649 --> 01:36:56,006
So they gave me a medaI
for the victory.

615
01:37:00,529 --> 01:37:04,442
Even after I'd kiIIed him,
no one wouId Iisten to me.

616
01:37:04,609 --> 01:37:08,284
No one wanted to hear the truth.

617
01:37:08,449 --> 01:37:12,488
And that's why I have to get back.

618
01:37:12,929 --> 01:37:17,878
The reaI story is buried
with those women and chiIdren.

619
01:37:18,889 --> 01:37:23,485
I have to teII somebody
what reaIIy happened.

620
01:37:24,129 --> 01:37:28,725
Because I can't Iive with it aIone
anymore.

621
01:37:29,569 --> 01:37:33,482
So Iet the truth come out.

622
01:37:34,449 --> 01:37:37,805
AII of it.

623
01:38:34,489 --> 01:38:36,844
Attack!

624
01:38:50,409 --> 01:38:53,481
- Another raid?
- No, a major attack.

625
01:38:53,649 --> 01:38:58,086
- What about thermaI activity?
- None so far.

626
01:38:58,249 --> 01:39:01,082
Son of a bitch.

627
01:40:04,209 --> 01:40:07,326
Marek!

628
01:40:16,969 --> 01:40:23,408
You want it?
Come and get it.

629
01:40:57,529 --> 01:41:01,283
- What's that?
- The sensors are overIoaded.

630
01:41:01,449 --> 01:41:04,407
Somebody wiII read that.

631
01:41:04,569 --> 01:41:09,518
Get me a chopper
and a fuIIy-armed riot pIatoon.

632
01:41:38,969 --> 01:41:41,642
I've got him.

633
01:41:48,209 --> 01:41:52,760
I don't envy you,
going back to a destructive worId.

634
01:41:58,249 --> 01:42:02,481
Six choppers standing by.
ECD, 1 2 minutes.

635
01:42:02,649 --> 01:42:05,004
I'm not waiting.
TeII them to foIIow.

636
01:43:43,409 --> 01:43:46,799
Tonight we'II bury the Father.

637
01:43:46,969 --> 01:43:51,042
Tomorrow,
we'II start rebuiIding the compound.

638
01:43:51,769 --> 01:43:55,398
Tomorrow, we start aII over again.

639
01:44:01,929 --> 01:44:04,727
No!

640
01:44:51,249 --> 01:44:53,444
Where is it?

641
01:44:55,009 --> 01:44:59,639
Is this how you teII him
what he wants to know?

642
01:44:59,809 --> 01:45:04,280
- Why?
- He promised to Iet me go.

643
01:45:04,449 --> 01:45:07,680
- He promised me freedom.
- I've got a promise for you.

644
01:45:07,849 --> 01:45:11,080
You'II heIp with the next boat,
or I'II kiII you!

645
01:45:11,249 --> 01:45:13,968
- He's coming.
- What?

646
01:45:14,129 --> 01:45:17,963
The warden.
He's coming straight away.

647
01:45:18,129 --> 01:45:20,359
What are the coordinates?

648
01:45:20,529 --> 01:45:22,440
Where wiII he Iand?

649
01:45:22,609 --> 01:45:27,444
- King, where?
- The Iower fieId, past the river.

650
01:45:27,729 --> 01:45:31,802
That's no good.
TeII him he needs new coordinates.

651
01:45:31,969 --> 01:45:34,358
- Right?
- Yes.

652
01:45:45,529 --> 01:45:48,999
Sir?
We have a transmission, code seven.

653
01:45:50,529 --> 01:45:52,406
Yes?

654
01:45:52,609 --> 01:45:54,725
The Ianding zone has a probIem.

655
01:45:54,889 --> 01:45:58,086
- What do you mean?
- The Outsiders ...

656
01:45:58,249 --> 01:46:02,367
They're retreating
through that area.

657
01:46:07,809 --> 01:46:10,642
Let's go, we don't have much time.

658
01:46:10,809 --> 01:46:13,721
Listen, the Father ...

659
01:46:13,889 --> 01:46:17,768
You taIked to him before ...
What did he say?

660
01:46:17,929 --> 01:46:20,807
He wanted me
to go to the authorities.

661
01:46:20,969 --> 01:46:25,087
And he toId me
he wanted you to take his pIace.

662
01:46:26,129 --> 01:46:31,601
I'II bIow this pIace wide open.
You have my word on that.

663
01:46:50,489 --> 01:46:52,320
