1
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:43,558
Friends.

2
00:01:50,586 --> 00:01:51,918
Drops.

3
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,919
Drops.
Drops it.

4
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:04,670
Lucy!

5
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:29,569
Return girl.

6
00:03:30,938 --> 00:03:32,322
Where are you going?

7
00:05:10,308 --> 00:05:11,736
Nice dog
What is?

8
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,484
Lucy.

9
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:15,200
You are beautiful Lucy.

10
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:17,235
What is race?

11
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:21,477
It is a mix of beagle and Retriver.

12
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,042
Where is the store
nearest here?

13
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:29,080
I do not know.

14
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:30,358
I am not from here.

15
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,214
I am only in passing.

16
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,348
Where?

17
00:05:33,497 --> 00:05:34,782
I'm going to Alaska.

18
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:37,491
I am going to the South.

19
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:41,570
We were there last year.

20
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:45,101
Iki, this girl is going to Alaska.

21
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,081
Que suerte.

22
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:51,363
It's great there.

23
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:53,919
Are you going to work?
Where are you going?

24
00:05:54,207 --> 00:05:55,584
Catchican.

25
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,133
Catchican ..

26
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:01,636
It's good but I know
better further north.

27
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:03,845
Should visit.

28
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:08,474
O over the northwest,
that is incredible.

29
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,173
Tell Michael Murphy
I know.

30
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,670
And Yours.

31
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:16,561
I will present, thank you.

32
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,455
The money is better there too.

33
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,171
That no expenditure
everything is easy.

34
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:28,371
But whatever you do, do not
tell the old Brutus, who know me.

35
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:32,951
Something that was annoying
when I was a little rushed.

36
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:39,207
There was one incident, my working,
an earth remover machine in

37
00:06:39,335 --> 00:06:41,529
the work site.

38
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:47,622
Some friends of mine ... they were stupid,
and turn the machine.

39
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:50,490
And leave it in neutral and that was it.

40
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:53,540
Dropped in front of the site
construction.

41
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:56,909
Do not let the detained
nobody told me that.

42
00:06:57,223 --> 00:07:01,616
So we finally leave, and
thing was over the construction,

43
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:04,555
we could not stop it,
we tried everything

44
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:06,307
Broken wire retention.

45
00:07:06,788 --> 00:07:08,510
There were big sparks.

46
00:07:09,306 --> 00:07:15,117
The machine was, above all, low
the hill and ended up in the water.

47
00:07:15,215 --> 00:07:18,588
Perhaps it was 100 thousand dollars in equipment,
lost 4 or 5 seconds.

48
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,778
But I could not blame.

49
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,091
I went ...

50
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:55,731
Timetables for trains.

51
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:40,273
Good night baby

52
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,510
Wake up.

53
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:28,593
Miss.

54
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:37,988
Can not sleep here.

55
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:40,895
Can not sleep here
is not allowed.

56
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:42,490
Okay.

57
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:46,039
Well, I'm going.

58
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:11,210
My car does not prendre.

59
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:13,327
I can hear it.

60
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,653
You can not park here
the rules are.

61
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:18,784
Yes, I understand.

62
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,489
I do not know what happens.

63
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:28,349
May help push it to the track.

64
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,762
Where is he?

65
00:10:34,173 --> 00:10:35,695
Back to the street.

66
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,805
We will have to push it.

67
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:48,201
Well, rises.

68
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:13,667
Lu ¡!

69
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:17,661
What do you know that ... this season?

70
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:21,661
Looks like a good business,
many cars come and go.

71
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:23,455
Is the closest.

72
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:27,634
Is there any food shop here?

73
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,999
Following the road is
Jack's.

74
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,554
Very good and very cheap.

75
00:11:31,986 --> 00:11:33,211
It is usually where I go.
Thanks.

76
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,357
Stay there.

77
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:30,203
Ven Lu.

78
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:01,467
I know.

79
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,241
I know.

80
00:15:07,737 --> 00:15:09,113
And return.

81
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,337
Are you not hungry?

82
00:15:56,444 --> 00:15:57,566
Sure you do.

83
00:15:57,654 --> 00:15:59,191
Come on.

84
00:16:29,345 --> 00:16:33,764
If, as one hour ... waiting here.

85
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:37,943
good as you said, I went to another place ..

86
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:41,210
I slept under the tree ..

87
00:16:43,177 --> 00:16:44,308
Jovencita.

88
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,694
There is a long line. I think some
these machines are damaged.

89
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:50,175
So take your time.

90
00:16:52,507 --> 00:16:56,504
I have no money to buy
your cans, but I tell you one thing ...

91
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,033
I stay with them ...
hola perrito.

92
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,560
I stay with them and
I'll give you the money later.

93
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,738
I mean ... just ...

94
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,319
There are not many cans
not worth the wait.

95
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,639
I'll find you.

96
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:15,019
He knows that quedeselos.

97
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:16,551
Are you sure?
Yes.

98
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,375
Thank you.

99
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:19,723
Thank you very much.

100
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:22,174
It's cool.

101
00:17:24,163 --> 00:17:25,446
Do not bother anyone, right?

102
00:17:27,668 --> 00:17:28,939
And return.

103
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,533
What I said?

104
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,158
Do not be upset.
We do not want that.

105
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:41,531
There you are.

106
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:44,929
Let go.

107
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,530
I think we forgot something.

108
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:47,739
Let go.

109
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:49,987
I think that something.
Let go.

110
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:53,315
Miss I have to ask
entry to the store, right?

111
00:20:00,418 --> 00:20:02,061
Sit here please.

112
00:20:02,205 --> 00:20:03,642
What is going Andy?

113
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,144
The customer refused to pay
for some products.

114
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:10,185
I saw everything.

115
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,066
I saw her from entering the store.

116
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,721
No, sorry.
That is not correct.

117
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,656
What are we talking about here?

118
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:19,182
Sorry

119
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:28,639
Lord, had not yet
finished buying.

120
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:37,987
Walked out the door by accident, without paying for those
cans, that was going to see my dog, who is tied up outside.

121
00:20:38,092 --> 00:20:40,481
Mr Hayden, it is obvious that
is happening here.

122
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,572
Lord ...

123
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,328
the employee has the wrong idea.

124
00:20:43,457 --> 00:20:45,297
Rules are applied
to all equally.

125
00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:57,200
If a person can not afford
Dog food should not have dogs.

126
00:21:00,455 --> 00:21:03,146
Sir, just made a mistake,
and I am very sorry.

127
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:05,033
This does not happen again.

128
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,992
The food is not the problem.

129
00:21:08,123 --> 00:21:09,993
It is setting an example, right?

130
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,767
I am not from here, sir,
I can not be an example.

131
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:16,504
We have a lady.

132
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:35,890
Hi, I'm Andy Muni
Jack's La Tieng.

133
00:21:55,723 --> 00:21:58,527
Sir, my dog is
attached to the front.

134
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:06,244
Lord my dog tied up outside.
Just relax.

135
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:09,742
Of the face.

136
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,171
Now your left.

137
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,766
I can give my backpack?

138
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:41,908
Not yet.

139
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:48,605
This machine will kill me.

140
00:23:49,926 --> 00:23:52,160
We must do this again ...

141
00:24:32,428 --> 00:24:34,118
$ 50.

142
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:36,750
Excuse me?

143
00:24:37,668 --> 00:24:40,390
You can pay your deposit now,
or you can return in 2 weeks,

144
00:24:40,503 --> 00:24:44,554
for a trial on the judge, and there will pay
50 dollars, plus court costs.

145
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,497
I do not live here, I'm just passing through.

146
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,416
If the stop in another state,
terminates here.

147
00:24:57,391 --> 00:24:59,417
You can use a credit card.

148
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:11,420
Cash.

149
00:26:18,216 --> 00:26:19,271
Lucy?

150
00:26:23,377 --> 00:26:24,600
Lu.

151
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:28,985
Have not seen a dog?

152
00:26:30,552 --> 00:26:32,906
Excuse me, does anyone have a dog?

153
00:26:33,223 --> 00:26:34,869
Was attached to the front this morning.

154
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:36,708
Brownish yellow.

155
00:26:36,817 --> 00:26:38,659
How a German shepherd?

156
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,224
Medium-sized
brown color of yellow.

157
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:47,518
I think I saw a van carried a dog.

158
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:49,309
Oh yeah?
What time was that?

159
00:26:50,094 --> 00:26:51,784
At noon I think ..

160
00:26:51,982 --> 00:26:52,791
¿Half day?

161
00:26:52,897 --> 00:26:54,894
If not start work until 2.

162
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:56,166
I have been then.

163
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:58,751
Sorry .. a white van,
What those in the city?

164
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:01,141
I do not know, I may be wrong.

165
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:02,833
She did not see anything.

166
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:05,352
¡Lucy!

167
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:09,586
Lu ¡!

168
00:27:18,544 --> 00:27:20,047
Lucy ..

169
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:23,393
Come Lu.

170
00:27:23,513 --> 00:27:24,801
Lucy.

171
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:32,074
Lucy, get out now ...

172
00:27:33,698 --> 00:27:35,306
What are you doing here?

173
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,671
Looking for my dog, should
be starving.

174
00:27:39,018 --> 00:27:42,428
¡Lucy, ven!

175
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:03,750
¡Lucy!

176
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,582
Come on girl, get out.

177
00:28:14,121 --> 00:28:16,345
Spend a good night, okay?

178
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:23,626
His son is a true hero.

179
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:26,674
¡Lucy!

180
00:28:27,048 --> 00:28:28,598
Come, now!

181
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:35,888
¡Lucy!

182
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,420
¡Lucy!

183
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,327
Have you seen my dog?

184
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:25,267
Not since I saw you.

185
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,854
That opens garage ever?

186
00:29:36,093 --> 00:29:37,777
Almost every day, yes.

187
00:29:45,092 --> 00:29:47,863
Is there a kennel for
here? There should be close.

188
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,960
Not very far.

189
00:29:52,922 --> 00:29:54,234
Are you pretty well?

190
00:29:57,194 --> 00:29:59,105
Yes, you have to go
to the kennel.

191
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,631
That's easy.

192
00:30:01,985 --> 00:30:08,689
Just take the street here in defrente,
until the end of the road.

193
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:12,947
Then get there, turn to the right,
be a 3 miles.

194
00:30:14,657 --> 00:30:16,847
Did you miss your dog, right?

195
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:18,366
If.

196
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,186
That seems.

197
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:24,304
My heart
¿Near here?

198
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,233
If, at that store.

199
00:30:27,507 --> 00:30:28,741
Where's Jack?

200
00:30:29,532 --> 00:30:31,275
Surely someone has it.

201
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,181
It could not have gone very far.

202
00:30:34,312 --> 00:30:36,158
I went for quite a while.

203
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,718
Sure was not much.

204
00:30:39,202 --> 00:30:42,242
Already appear.

205
00:30:45,091 --> 00:30:46,576
Well.

206
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,159
So I go for this
Street, then right.

207
00:30:56,914 --> 00:30:59,892
I am sure that now is closed
and you'll have to wait until tomorrow.

208
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:03,397
But you can take Bus No. 4
here in the corner, and it will bring.

209
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:05,525
Departing from 6 a.m.

210
00:31:06,295 --> 00:31:07,970
I think I'll go now.

211
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,305
Be closed.

212
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:17,159
That I know.

213
00:31:19,655 --> 00:31:22,341
Because if there is,
should be in tomorrow, right?

214
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:25,930
In the kennel never hurt anyone.

215
00:31:30,475 --> 00:31:33,424
There is a good hotel there,
Palms.

216
00:31:34,103 --> 00:31:35,697
Rooms clean.

217
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:44,361
If I see something, you know I will.

218
00:31:54,155 --> 00:31:55,180
Hello?

219
00:31:55,855 --> 00:31:57,355
Hello Dan.

220
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,271
Wendy?

221
00:31:59,491 --> 00:32:01,716
Let me turn off the TV.

222
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:06,133
Where are you?

223
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:09,270
In Oregon.

224
00:32:10,342 --> 00:32:11,882
Alone?

225
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:15,354
If something like that.

226
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:18,456
And what happens?

227
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:22,948
Anything, just call ...

228
00:32:24,117 --> 00:32:25,352
I do not know.

229
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:29,203
Nothing? ...

230
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,891
The car broke down.

231
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,597
And it's a bad thing ...

232
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,114
Lucy is lost.

233
00:32:42,857 --> 00:32:44,633
Who is that?

234
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:46,998
Your sister, her car broke down in Oregon.

235
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,702
Hi Deb.

236
00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:51,835
What do you want for it?

237
00:32:53,607 --> 00:32:54,925
Nothing ...

238
00:32:55,217 --> 00:32:56,908
Just call.

239
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,835
Solo's calling.

240
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,997
We can not do anything.
I do not know what they want.

241
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:04,754
I do not want anything, just call.

242
00:33:04,894 --> 00:33:09,079
I can not continue onthe phone.
We talk later.

243
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:10,772
Bye honey.

244
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:15,433
Is everything okay?

245
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:17,556
If all is well.

246
00:33:18,132 --> 00:33:21,808
It is already dark,
So I call you later.

247
00:33:22,444 --> 00:33:23,286
Okay.

248
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:24,706
Everything will be fine,
see you.

249
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:25,731
If we are,
adios.

250
00:33:25,975 --> 00:33:27,089
Adios.

251
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:24,926
Lu ¡!

252
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:33,390
Lu ¡!

253
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,056
Man look,

254
00:35:02,689 --> 00:35:03,860
Go thing.

255
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:06,912
Yes, that should be banned.

256
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:20,134
One moment.

257
00:36:19,162 --> 00:36:22,325
Is medium in size.
about 39 pounds.

258
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:24,224
Yellow brown.

259
00:36:25,118 --> 00:36:26,606
Her name is Lucy.

260
00:36:26,864 --> 00:36:30,353
Leave it tied to a pole,
and when I got back was no more.

261
00:36:30,638 --> 00:36:33,124
Well, I do not see anything that matches.

262
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,044
But let's look back
you never know.

263
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:38,414
Follow me.

264
00:36:47,348 --> 00:36:50,079
Well, look, and let me know.

265
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:54,701
Ok. Or direction.

266
00:38:56,596 --> 00:38:59,060
Or phone.

267
00:38:59,947 --> 00:39:01,138
No, I mean, we do not.

268
00:39:05,281 --> 00:39:06,936
I happened ...

269
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:08,820
Did you have a previous address?

270
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:15,957
My sister and her husband, they
living in this 73.

271
00:39:16,628 --> 00:39:21,720
This Jackson, Montsindiana 47603.

272
00:39:21,755 --> 00:39:22,839
I can use that.

273
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:25,341
Ok.

274
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:30,050
Do you think you will find it soon?

275
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:30,991
Well ...

276
00:39:32,564 --> 00:39:34,004
You'll have to keep looking.

277
00:39:34,491 --> 00:39:35,661
Now it is up to you

278
00:39:37,383 --> 00:39:39,574
Ok.

279
00:39:40,423 --> 00:39:41,233
Thank you.

280
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:36,383
I think not.

281
00:40:39,118 --> 00:40:42,999
Ok, this will cause the 36Q is well.

282
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:47,701
I do not see any problem in the battery.

283
00:40:48,454 --> 00:40:49,766
I hope so.

284
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,698
14 should be known.

285
00:40:54,664 --> 00:40:55,263
Ok.

286
00:40:56,474 --> 00:41:01,167
If you read the lesson 12, you might have a problem.

287
00:41:01,907 --> 00:41:02,618
Ok.

288
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:03,770
I tell you that ...

289
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:05,559
Turn on the heater.

290
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:08,907
Lights the father.

291
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:10,187
Turn on the radio.

292
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:11,947
Warm up the engine.

293
00:41:11,982 --> 00:41:14,113
Turn anything that consumes
energy.

294
00:41:14,148 --> 00:41:16,114
Turn the engine and start the engine.

295
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:22,331
And if the meter is still under voltage
14 volts.

296
00:41:24,173 --> 00:41:25,558
Probably not well.

297
00:41:26,107 --> 00:41:27,438
Well, good luck.

298
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,679
What?

299
00:41:30,943 --> 00:41:31,942
Start talking, listening.

300
00:41:33,388 --> 00:41:35,537
I think something happens to my
spell.

301
00:41:36,134 --> 00:41:37,790
What?

302
00:41:38,261 --> 00:41:41,449
My Spell, I think my bell 17
broke.

303
00:41:42,617 --> 00:41:44,127
Thus, 17.

304
00:41:46,695 --> 00:41:47,910
We got in town.

305
00:41:48,768 --> 00:41:52,785
Was broken and then asked me
$ 150 for a new one.

306
00:41:54,468 --> 00:41:56,257
Driving with the air conditioning
lit.

307
00:41:56,292 --> 00:41:59,863
The bidding on any motor
of those things?

308
00:42:00,707 --> 00:42:01,921
No.

309
00:42:01,956 --> 00:42:04,107
Just do not start and a sondio
terrible.

310
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:08,597
If.

311
00:42:11,055 --> 00:42:11,735
Man.

312
00:42:12,303 --> 00:42:14,930
Gonna blow my brains.

313
00:42:16,329 --> 00:42:17,958
You make a problem with my mind.

314
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,685
Ok, I'll tell you that.

315
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,315
If.

316
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:25,302
50 at the gate.

317
00:42:26,827 --> 00:42:28,643
No, that's all.

318
00:42:30,263 --> 00:42:31,325
Yes

319
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,703
I said I really did
a problem with my mind.

320
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:35,612
Yeah, ok.

321
00:42:36,837 --> 00:42:39,184
If.

322
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:40,286
See you later.

323
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:45,304
What kind of car we
talking about?

324
00:42:47,184 --> 00:42:49,617
Acord is a 1988.

325
00:42:49,652 --> 00:42:51,618
There.

326
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:53,125
Well ...

327
00:42:53,915 --> 00:42:57,402
It's easy to be the belt
or spark ignition no casts.

328
00:42:57,437 --> 00:42:59,231
Who knows may be the belt
small.

329
00:43:00,924 --> 00:43:03,826
Is there a belt 17?

330
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:07,075
Well ... $ 100

331
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,678
125 if they have to tidy
a new one.

332
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:14,050
And by doing so would be 50.

333
00:43:16,689 --> 00:43:17,781
Is the best we can find.

334
00:43:17,816 --> 00:43:19,114
Ok.

335
00:43:19,149 --> 00:43:21,000
And such a small belt.

336
00:43:21,035 --> 00:43:22,035
How much?

337
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:23,607
Might be a bit more.

338
00:43:24,275 --> 00:43:25,759
But you will not know until I see it.

339
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:27,711
Ok.

340
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:33,036
And, we tow
and I will be another 50.

341
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,444
But it is just there.

342
00:43:38,105 --> 00:43:41,740
Well, it is always 50, is a model
old they are 50.

343
00:43:49,038 --> 00:43:51,121
$ 30 will do the deal.

344
00:43:53,395 --> 00:43:54,096
If.

345
00:45:39,855 --> 00:45:40,652
How is the dog?

346
00:45:44,946 --> 00:45:45,684
Nothing new.

347
00:45:47,307 --> 00:45:48,095
Did you search?

348
00:45:50,737 --> 00:45:51,344
Not yet.

349
00:45:55,983 --> 00:45:58,911
I had a Collie and spent 2 weeks
to return home.

350
00:45:59,793 --> 00:46:00,390
You will find it.

351
00:46:01,313 --> 00:46:02,375
Always get your dog.

352
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:05,656
I hope so.

353
00:46:08,289 --> 00:46:10,922
Can cambiarmer for 25 cents?

354
00:46:10,957 --> 00:46:15,149

Take a few minutes.

357
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:20,889
Nobody uses the phone more.

358
00:46:20,924 --> 00:46:21,704
Come on.

359
00:46:27,281 --> 00:46:28,007

374
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:46,784
It can be said.

375
00:47:47,669 --> 00:47:49,193
I do not know what people do
out there.

376
00:47:50,816 --> 00:47:51,807
I used to be good.

377
00:47:52,449 --> 00:47:55,355
But much time has passed already.

378
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:56,882
I do not know they do.

379
00:48:01,808 --> 00:48:04,426
I can not get a job without a
direction anyway.

380
00:48:05,136 --> 00:48:05,919
Or a phone.

381
00:48:06,912 --> 00:48:09,176
You can not get an address
without an address.

382
00:48:09,211 --> 00:48:10,491
You can not have a job without a
work.

383
00:48:11,601 --> 00:48:12,488
Everything is arranged.

384
00:48:13,251 --> 00:48:14,882
It's like going to Alaska.

385
00:48:18,459 --> 00:48:19,466
There are no people.

386
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,803
I heard that there is very nice
up.

387
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:23,926
If.

388
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:29,459
Know if you need a contact for
something.

389
00:48:29,494 --> 00:48:31,936
I'm here standing with his hands
in my pocket all day.

390
00:48:34,936 --> 00:48:36,510
You can use my phone number
if desired.

391
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:40,177
If.

392
00:48:44,607 --> 00:48:45,478
I will do that.

393
00:48:45,479 --> 00:48:49,529
That will be good.

394
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,780
I'm lost.

395
00:49:12,445 --> 00:49:13,555
Friendly

396
00:49:47,073 --> 00:49:50,152
Lost your dog?

397
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:51,462
Where did you lose?

398
00:49:51,497 --> 00:49:52,375
Do not know.

399
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:54,355
I guess you know where rioja
find.

400
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:54,907
No.

401
00:49:54,942 --> 00:49:57,643
It is very bad, if I see you
a call.

402
00:49:57,678 --> 00:49:58,258
Thank you.

403
00:49:58,293 --> 00:49:58,952
Good luck.

404
00:49:58,987 --> 00:49:59,849
Thanks for that.

405
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:11,044
Anything?

406
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,742
Nothing.

407
00:51:14,974 --> 00:51:16,416
They came by car.

408
00:51:22,058 --> 00:51:24,721
You remember the day that was
a child and going to hunt.

409
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,798
And sometimes lost andalusia greyhound.

410
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:30,376
Then my dad left his coat
and leaving it in the woods.

411
00:51:30,411 --> 00:51:32,844
In the last stating that he had
seen the dog.

412
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:35,586
And then returned.

413
00:51:38,454 --> 00:51:40,568
More often than that, the return
with the dog too.

414
00:51:43,165 --> 00:51:44,721
Can I use your phone again?

415
00:51:45,499 --> 00:51:46,111
Clear.

416
00:51:48,701 --> 00:51:49,409
Thank you.

417
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:03,837
Alo, was calling for a dog
reported that he had lost Lucy.

418
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:09,281
It's just being away from my phone
I thought it was called.

419
00:52:10,456 --> 00:52:11,064
Ok.

420
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:13,698
Ok, thank you, goodbye.

421
00:52:22,729 --> 00:52:23,890
Wait.

422
00:52:25,707 --> 00:52:28,311
The dog returned to the shelter.

423
00:52:29,051 --> 00:52:29,612
If.

424
00:52:30,459 --> 00:52:31,462
It's like I remember.

425
00:56:57,403 --> 00:56:58,764
I do not look.

426
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:08,415
This is true.

427
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:10,660
No.

428
00:57:12,412 --> 00:57:13,344
Those things.

429
00:57:13,737 --> 00:57:16,770
Come on now, on the table.

430
00:57:16,805 --> 00:57:17,913
There are fun.

431
00:57:21,534 --> 00:57:25,333
Clearly this car was not very
Hot and maintained.

432
00:57:44,296 --> 00:57:46,150
I hate this place.

433
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:50,685
Fuck the people.

434
00:57:51,998 --> 00:57:53,557
Fuck people is what it is.

435
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,067
I have that.

436
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:09,134
Do not be afraid.

437
00:58:10,827 --> 00:58:12,226
Just try to be a good child.

438
00:58:14,204 --> 00:58:15,668
They do not want.

439
00:58:21,729 --> 00:58:23,149
They treat me like garbage.

440
00:58:23,905 --> 00:58:25,122
Not entitled.

441
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:31,891
I mean they can ...

442
00:58:34,373 --> 00:58:36,421
Can smell the weakness in yourself.

443
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:38,543
If.

444
00:58:39,977 --> 00:58:42,263
And fuck, fuck.

445
00:58:45,013 --> 00:58:48,759
And I never knew but kill people.

446
00:58:48,794 --> 00:58:49,881
With their hands.

447
00:59:00,489 --> 00:59:01,877
You are missed.

448
00:59:05,764 --> 00:59:06,369
The devil.

449
01:00:56,162 --> 01:00:57,343
I know.

450
01:00:58,186 --> 01:00:58,847
Coming.

451
01:02:25,163 --> 01:02:27,840
As if you'd rather status
to strike.

452
01:02:28,317 --> 01:02:30,016
Well I've been here since this
day.

453
01:02:30,051 --> 01:02:32,162
Where were you?

454
01:02:32,197 --> 01:02:34,150
Polly had to send to school.

455
01:02:34,185 --> 01:02:35,750
It's my day off too.

456
01:02:37,245 --> 01:02:39,792
Got a call after you
were you last night.

457
01:02:39,827 --> 01:02:40,587
They found him.

458
01:02:40,622 --> 01:02:41,469
Really?

459
01:02:42,236 --> 01:02:42,761
True.

460
01:02:55,491 --> 01:02:56,887
Hi I'm Wendy Carlos.

461
01:02:57,714 --> 01:03:00,321
Called because it left a message
Last night my dog Lucy.

462
01:03:07,721 --> 01:03:09,018
Is positive.

463
01:03:16,561 --> 01:03:17,487
Ok.

464
01:03:17,522 --> 01:03:19,236
Where is it exactly?

465
01:03:22,163 --> 01:03:24,305
Live in the 3rd Mits.

466
01:03:25,516 --> 01:03:27,259
In the 3rd Live Ericson Mits.

467
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:33,440
Ok.

468
01:03:33,475 --> 01:03:34,441
I'll be there right now.

469
01:03:34,476 --> 01:03:35,486
Thank you very much.

470
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:37,141
Adios.

471
01:03:39,897 --> 01:03:40,921
Well, good news.

472
01:03:43,335 --> 01:03:44,946
This is good news.
This is good news.

473
01:03:46,674 --> 01:03:47,715
Someone took her home.

474
01:03:49,315 --> 01:03:52,105
Had it in a home until the
led to a kennel.

475
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,590
That's why I was hard to find.

476
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,358
I was in a house.

477
01:03:55,393 --> 01:03:56,970
Well, I said that the encounter.

478
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:58,864
As in resgitro.

479
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:00,304
Everything is on the register

480
01:04:01,747 --> 01:04:02,385
So that's it.

481
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:03,485
Going for it.

482
01:04:05,178 --> 01:04:05,740
That's the plan.

483
01:04:06,648 --> 01:04:08,151
Well, I hope that everything works.

484
01:04:09,293 --> 01:04:10,213
I know it will.

485
01:04:15,491 --> 01:04:16,794
I want to take this.

486
01:04:16,829 --> 01:04:17,781
Do not deny it.

487
01:04:18,863 --> 01:04:19,720
Just do not deny it.

488
01:04:20,417 --> 01:04:23,170
I do not want to see me.

489
01:04:24,576 --> 01:04:25,062
Just ...

490
01:04:25,097 --> 01:04:26,841
If you ever happen again
here again.

491
01:04:26,876 --> 01:04:28,054
We stopped to say hello.

492
01:04:29,703 --> 01:04:30,487
Thank you.

493
01:04:31,237 --> 01:04:31,784
I will.

494
01:04:34,963 --> 01:04:36,623
Ok, goodbye.

495
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:58,191
TRAVEL TIMES OF THE BALSADERO

496
01:05:03,715 --> 01:05:05,832
FISHERY NOROESTE

497
01:05:43,021 --> 01:05:43,712
Good morning.

498
01:05:44,322 --> 01:05:44,954
Good.

499
01:05:46,157 --> 01:05:47,034
Arrive early.

500
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:50,858
Want some coffee?

501
01:05:50,893 --> 01:05:52,402
I think the first is finished.

502
01:05:56,993 --> 01:05:57,915
From Indiana.

503
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:00,446
You're far from home.

504
01:06:03,673 --> 01:06:06,005
And I have a long journey, too.

505
01:06:08,361 --> 01:06:10,886
Well the type was well on rioja
belt.

506
01:06:10,921 --> 01:06:12,323
That ruined everything.

507
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:15,590
It's just a matter of time
you leave the car.

508
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:17,285
Yes, that's what they say.

509
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,220
Not bad but not
well.

510
01:06:20,295 --> 01:06:21,767
The belt does not cerpentina
sale.

511
01:06:21,802 --> 01:06:23,560
But that is not why
the car will not start.

512
01:06:25,019 --> 01:06:26,314
Do you have milky oil.

513
01:06:29,763 --> 01:06:31,417
Not asked to review the oil.

514
01:06:32,767 --> 01:06:33,451
Only I say.

515
01:06:34,797 --> 01:06:36,027
Do not let the piston works.

516
01:06:36,771 --> 01:06:38,635
In fact it will fall
first.

517
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:40,818
And probably when you are in
bad time.

518
01:06:40,853 --> 01:06:44,808
This fluid can not compress
then there is this ending

519
01:06:44,843 --> 01:06:47,249
what we call hidrolap.

520
01:06:49,237 --> 01:06:52,193
And if you want your car back
running.

521
01:06:52,228 --> 01:06:53,514
You'll have to rebuild the entire engine.

522
01:06:54,991 --> 01:06:56,597
I honestly do not think that queira
do.

523
01:06:56,632 --> 01:06:57,857
Costs more than the car.

524
01:07:03,382 --> 01:07:04,130
If.

525
01:07:05,531 --> 01:07:06,882
I could not go yesterday.

526
01:07:08,313 --> 01:07:09,760
Can you call back more
late?

527
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:11,661
Ok.

528
01:07:12,624 --> 01:07:13,182
Adios.

529
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:16,225
Are you sure?

530
01:07:17,444 --> 01:07:18,011
If.

531
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,055
In question.

532
01:07:27,004 --> 01:07:27,846
How much?

533
01:07:29,066 --> 01:07:29,765
To fix it?

534
01:07:31,753 --> 01:07:32,889
2 000.

535
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:36,036
At least 2 000.

536
01:07:36,839 --> 01:07:38,787
As I said most of the auto
no good.

537
01:07:38,822 --> 01:07:40,780
A new car is better.

538
01:07:49,061 --> 01:07:51,490
Look, I know this is bad news.

539
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:53,217
It's something that nobody wants to hear.

540
01:07:54,381 --> 01:07:56,955
You see the thing is that the car
is back and that takes up space

541
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,424
I need to know what to do with it.

542
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:05,136
I'll say that, leave $ 30 for the hopper
careful.

543
01:08:05,171 --> 01:08:07,493
And we will take care of everything
others and that would be everything.

544
01:08:07,528 --> 01:08:09,780
We can not leave your car
there has to go.

545
01:08:40,645 --> 01:08:41,973
I think it is here.

546
01:08:56,867 --> 01:08:57,866
Thank you.

547
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:55,840
Hey Lu.

548
01:10:56,658 --> 01:10:57,268
You miss me.

549
01:10:58,235 --> 01:10:58,943
You miss me.

550
01:11:01,104 --> 01:11:01,916
You miss me.

551
01:11:06,642 --> 01:11:07,077
Sorry.

552
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:08,345
Come here.

553
01:11:16,456 --> 01:11:17,708
I know, I know.

554
01:11:17,743 --> 01:11:20,909
Come on, do not be mad.

555
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,837
I brought you something.

556
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:33,719
Look at that.

557
01:11:35,854 --> 01:11:36,750
Go and bring them.

558
01:11:37,645 --> 01:11:38,637
Good girl.

559
01:11:39,516 --> 01:11:40,728
You're a good trapper.

560
01:11:41,719 --> 01:11:42,298
Let.
