that.

in middle of the sea.

He was in a fierce storm and
he just knew he was gonna die.

So he cried out, "God save me!"

655
00:47:22,718 --> 00:47:26,321
And all of a sudden, his ship
caught fire.

656
00:47:28,657 --> 00:47:33,295
He jumped overboard and
clutching to a piece of a hull,

657
00:47:33,328 --> 00:47:38,266
I mean angry and scared.

658
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:42,805
And he cried out again,

659
00:47:43,806 --> 00:47:44,706
"Why did you abandon me?

660
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:48,845
"I asked for help and you burnt
my ship."

661
00:47:51,513 --> 00:47:53,248
And all of a sudden,

662
00:47:53,281 --> 00:47:57,586
this huge ship just cuts
right through the storm

663
00:47:57,619 --> 00:47:59,221
and pulls the man to safety.

664
00:48:00,522 --> 00:48:02,224
And the captain said to the man,

665
00:48:03,225 --> 00:48:05,795
"It's a good thing that
your ship caught fire

666
00:48:06,561 --> 00:48:09,531

never would have seen you."

670

God could have wiped us all
out, the whole human race.

671
00:48:27,716 --> 00:48:30,552
But instead he said,
"No, they are worth it."

672
00:48:33,622 --> 00:48:35,825
God doesn't need us, He wants
us.

673

and died on the cross.

burn before we're rescued.

may come in a small voice.

01:20:09,518 --> 01:20:10,586
is the one to her head.

It's bleeding inside the

It causes a lot of pressure.

Okay, Tulsa is not
responding to treatment.

1177
01:29:29,879 --> 01:29:31,881
The pressure is not being
relieved in her brain

1178
01:29:31,914 --> 01:29:33,681
as we had hoped it would.

1179
01:29:33,715 --> 01:29:35,885
The pressure is just too great.

1180
01:29:35,918 --> 01:29:37,052
Now, if this should continue,

1181
01:29:37,086 --> 01:29:39,255
she is going to slip into an
actual coma.

1182
01:29:39,288 --> 01:29:41,157
Yeah, but she seemed to
be improving last week.

1183
01:29:41,190 --> 01:29:44,860
I understand that but
sadly it's not uncommon

1184
01:29:44,894 --> 01:29:47,695
for a patient to rally right
before a major setback.

1185
01:29:50,432 --> 01:29:51,267
So what do we do?

1186
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:53,469
I mean, there's gotta be some
options.

1187
01:29:53,502 --> 01:29:56,238
Yes, there's a procedure that
we can do

1188
01:29:56,272 --> 01:29:58,107
to relieve the pressure
but I need to tell you

1189
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:00,142
that this procedure can be
fairly risky.

1190
01:30:01,210 --> 01:30:02,111
How risky?

1191
01:30:03,445 --> 01:30:07,883
I'd give it a 50% chance
of healthy recovery.

1192
01:30:09,985 --> 01:30:10,953
And the other 50?

1193
01:30:11,921 --> 01:30:16,325
That would be either
permanent paralysis or worse.

1194
01:30:17,092 --> 01:30:21,130
So what you're saying is
if we do nothing Tulsa dies.

1195
01:30:22,898 --> 01:30:25,367
And if we have this
procedure she could also die.

1196
01:30:27,002 --> 01:30:30,306
I understand that this is not
good news,

1197
01:30:30,339 --> 01:30:33,142
but it is what we're dealing
with.

1198
01:30:35,077 --> 01:30:36,045
In the meantime, what we'll do

1199
01:30:36,078 --> 01:30:38,380
is we'll manage Tulsa's
pain as well as we can.

1200
01:30:38,414 --> 01:30:41,317
We'll do everything we can
to relieve the pressure

1201
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:43,485
on her brain and we
will hope for the best.

know

1438
01:50:48,390 --> 01:50:50,559
that life is not fair sometimes.

1439
01:50:51,493 --> 01:50:53,962
But, we can always trust that
God is good.

1440
01:50:54,763 --> 01:50:56,565
Spending time with my daddy

1441
01:50:56,598 --> 01:51:00,235
was the best dream come true,
only better.

By now, I'm in heaven with mama
and Jesus.

Don't worry, I'll find your son
too.

Tell Tiny I miss him and
he needs to wash his hands.

please adopt Michael, promise
me.

figured out?

1456
01:52:05,634 --> 01:52:06,535
She always did.

1457
01:52:09,771 --> 01:52:11,440
I stopped in at work today.

1458
01:52:12,474 --> 01:52:14,243
You're back from leave?

1459
01:52:14,276 --> 01:52:17,446
No, I stopped by to officially
resign.

1460
01:52:20,148 --> 01:52:21,049
I'm sorry.

1461
01:52:21,083 --> 01:52:25,220
Don't apologize, you're a good
man Tommy.

1462
01:52:26,388 --> 01:52:28,423
- No I'm not.
- Yes you are.

1463
01:52:28,457 --> 01:52:30,359
You risked everything
for that little girl.

1464

You loved her

1465
01:52:31,460 --> 01:52:33,796
and you cared for her all
the way until the end,

1466
01:52:36,231 --> 01:52:38,467
even though you knew she
wasn't your daughter.

1467
01:52:40,702 --> 01:52:42,571
I saw the test results.

1468
01:52:46,575 --> 01:52:48,243
That test means nothing to me.

1469
01:52:48,978 --> 01:52:52,748
She will always be my daughter,
always.
