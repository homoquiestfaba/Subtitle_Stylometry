00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,235
I wouldn't kick

until his chest is flat
and his heart is a flapjack.

52
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,007
I wouldn't do that.
And neither would Arthur.

53
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:41,441
That's
because he refuses to fight.

54
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:43,077
He refuses to be a man.

55
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:45,146
I won't be terrorized
into acting like a savage

56
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,681
just because I was born male.

57
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,381
And I don't want to be
rewarded for it either.

58
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:51,786
(scoffs) He doesn't want
the reward, friends.

I'd ask you to give it to me,
but you can't.

62
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,429
It doesn't work that way, duck.

63
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,497
You might as well
keep the title.

64
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,102
[Ida] Well,
I think Arthur has it right.

65
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,605
Men want me.

66
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:14,542
(gasps) Not you, Baker,
my precious love.

67
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,744
But yeah, sometimes you.

68
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:19,280
And women don't bore you?

69
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,281
[Ida] Most stupid women.

70
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,414
[Suze] Oh!

71
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:22,550
American women.

72
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,451
(Suze mimics dog barking)

73
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,520
[Les] You, Ida, are an
American woman, you know that?

74
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:28,122
[Baker]
I hope you're not suggesting

75
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:29,991
that women don't endorse
the male identity.

76
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,360
In fact,
you reinforce masculinity

77
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,861
- inside me daily.
- (Ida laughs)

78
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:35,495
[Baker] You wouldn't
allow me to let go of it

79
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,931
any more than
another fellow would.

80
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,933
[Ida] Oh,
I'm oppressing you, am I?

81
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,736
You aren't at all interested
in dominating me?

82
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,571
[Les] I mean, what can
we do as men, really?

83
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,640
Inside the male-dominated
system,

84
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,342
inside the supreme sex class,
you know,

85
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,644
it is from ancient times.

86
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,045
But I'll tell you,

87
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,412
I'd like someone to be
my man for once

88
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:53,948
so I can relax for the weekend.

89
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,650
[Ida] Oh, yes,
that's the word for it, Les.

90
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:58,052
- [Ida] Relax.
- I'll be your man.

91
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,621
Sure you're interested
in being a man, Suze.

92
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:02,356
But are you interested
in growing up a boy,

93
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:05,359
dragooned until you act like
a boy is supposed to act?

94
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,494
"Dragooned!" My goodness.

95
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:09,897
How frightening.
No, all I'm saying is

96
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:12,066
all of us want to be
Stanley Kowalski.

97
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,433
I wasn't saying that.

98
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,503
Getting a woody
from our own power.

99
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:18,339
[Ida] Oh, Suze,
perhaps a bridge too far.

100
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,807
You're a Jewish woman!

101
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:21,642
- You love to fuck.
- She loves to be fucked.

102
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:23,311
[Les] I maintain
that we are all fucked

103
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,879
no matter what's
in our dungarees.

104
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,914
[Ida] Anyway,
is all of this punching talk,

105
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:30,518
this brutal Stanley Kowalski
talk really appropriate?

106
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,485
I mean, two people
have been terribly hurt.

107
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,322
Oh, they're surely dead.

108
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,455
[Ida] No, can't be.

109
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,658
Don't doubt that.

110
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:38,659
They're dead.

111
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:41,762
Not dead. Arthur?

112
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:48,002
Dead as the doe in <i>Bambi.</i>

113
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:50,237
You sound delighted.

114
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:51,572
She sounds orgiastic.

115
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:52,873
It's out of my control.

116
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:54,075
My tone.

117
00:07:55,276 --> 00:07:58,446
Must be the lingering effects
of panic,

118
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:03,584
of shock because,
I mean, these hustlers,

119
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:06,087
these lunatics...

120
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,924
they know where we live.

121
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:16,697
The exact apartment, 2B.

122
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:19,033
Arthur's barely slept.

123
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,101
I'm all jitters.

124
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:21,535
Keep checking the lock.

125
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,104
I walk through the door,
check the lock,

126
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:25,439
I walk back to the bedroom
and then suddenly,

127
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:26,807
I see, not Brando himself,

128
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:28,542
but a Brando type and aggressor

129
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:32,847
and his gang of Brandos
knocking down the door.

130
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:35,683
And well...

131
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:38,219
Well?

132
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,057
Well, I don't know what happens
when they get inside,

133
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,259
but it's a wild image, really.

134
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:48,095
And it's the only image
in my whole head.

135
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:52,800
[Les] Hey, Arthur,
you want to play some sides?

136
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,703
[Baker] Yes,
give us some sounds.

137
00:08:57,138 --> 00:08:59,306
Arthur's had his cage rattled.

138
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,908
Look at the deer.

139
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,746
Oh, he's just a slob
of a wet rag tonight,

140
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,581
aren't you, duck?

141
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,985
Come on.

142
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,620
Tell 'em.

143
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,624
- (record screeching)
- (all exclaiming)

144
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,995
Some men are the kind of men
other men fear.

145
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,963
Some men are the kind of men

146
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:26,967
other men want to hold tight
in a friendly embrace, unafraid.

147
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:28,702
Some are sissies for bullies.

148
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:30,871
Some are real sports
who play along.

149
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,706
But the world of men

150
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,210
is always one of comparison
and measurement!

151
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:40,114
I'm perceiving myself right now

152
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,551
in contrast to the two men
in this room

153
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,785
and in contrast
to the two women also.

154
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,587
Am I enough of a man?

155
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,988
Is my attempt to be

156
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:51,192
more of a man pitiful
and obvious?

157
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:54,261
I feel threatened
by all four of you, by,

158
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:56,297
by both your sexes, your,

159
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,366
your collective sexitness.

160
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:05,673
Ow.

00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:04,191
<i>♪ Always the same ♪</i>

180
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:11,332
<i>♪ When you're hungry in love ♪</i>

181
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:26,581
You've always been
very precious with me.

182
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:28,182
That's a sweet thing to say.

183
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:31,218
I don't really care
for that kind of preciousness.

184
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,320
Hmm.

185
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:38,192
Admit you have
a terrible sense of humor.

186
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:40,060
No.

187
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:42,029
Admit you have
no sense of humor at all then?

188
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:48,235
I admit it's amazing the things
I don't know about you.

189
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:51,506
Now, stand up.
Come, kiss my neck.

190
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,574
No. No.
No, no, no.

191
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:54,041
I want to worship you.

192
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:56,877
I want to...
I want to be beneath you.

193
00:12:57,011 --> 00:13:00,715
I want to be here
on the floor at your feet,

194
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:02,617
kissing your feet.

195
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:04,753
Play along, Arthur.

196
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,186
Play easy to get, won't you?

197
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,454
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna pull you up.

198
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:09,823
Yes.
Pull me up.

199
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:13,394
Give me French kisses!

200
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:17,331
(Suze chuckles)

201
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,702
Everyone thinks
we're just great.

202
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,269
Everyone loves us.

203
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:29,343
[Suze] The last of the greats.

204
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,218
I want to eat
a fuckin' hamburger.

205
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:39,987
Hmm.

206
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:43,490
(scoffs)

207
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:46,327
[Suze] Hey.

208
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:56,571
I've decided
to let you be the crybaby

209
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,707
about all of this!

210
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,542
(door slams)

211
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:32,640
(dramatic theme playing)

212
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,603
[door bangs]

213
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:03,937
[door opens in distance]

214
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,973
[Maureen] Help me.

215
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,575
[bottles clattering]

216
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,210
Come on, help me.

217
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:13,080
Come on.

218
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,051
No doormat.

219
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,087
I don't know how you live.

220
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,291
I mean, of course,
you are 2B, but I'm 10F.

221
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:27,695
Help me, my goodness.

222
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:29,898
Yes.

223
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,265
So, come on, Susan.

224
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:34,234
What, what do you want me to do?

225
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:38,606
Help a neighbor.

226
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,709
(sauntering theme playing)

227
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:46,180
This must be
what purgatory is like.

228
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,850
Always
a flight of stairs beneath

229
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:53,721
a beautiful woman
never able to catch up to her.

230
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,989
But what would happen
when you reach her?

231
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,158
I mean, where would you be then?

232
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:01,094
Heaven?

233
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,031
Or someplace else?

234
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:08,035
(romantic theme playing)

235
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,724
[Maureen] Join me.

236
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,433
[Maureen] Come on.

237
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:49,009
(Suze sighs)

238
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,549
Are you famous?

239
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,554
I ought to be famous.

240
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,725
But I'm just married.

241
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:07,795
Right.
But I'm married, too.

242
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:09,396
Yeah.

243
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,065
I've seen your husband.

244
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:15,937
Where have you seen him?

245
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,706
You spy all that junk out there?

246
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:24,546
I myself am not interested
in all that junk.

247
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:28,048
I want a piece of art.

248
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,584
Fine art.

249
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:35,055
Something big and messy,
takes up the whole wall.

250
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,124
Something abstract, you know?

251
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,092
I was waiting
at the artist studio

252
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,029
all day today.

253
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:43,932
Had a nice,
sloppy one picked out.

254
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,600
Then I started thinking,

255
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,067
"Where's Daddy?"

256
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,604
And do you know
where he was at the last?

257
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:51,039
He was at Gimbel's,

258
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:54,408
buying me
another cold plug-in box.

259
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:57,745
Another stand-in for a man

260
00:17:57,879 --> 00:18:00,848
but more powerful, harder.

261
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,384
Poor dope doesn't even realize

262
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,822
that I'm surrounded
by gigantic vibrators.

263
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,389
(chuckles)

264
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:11,325
Just doesn't fit this
apartment, I'm sorry.

265
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:15,162
These are the slums,
and I'm a slum starlet,

266
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:19,466
and it's as crummy
and miserable as all that.

267
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,438
I saw two people get murdered
on our stoop last night.

268
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:27,174
Yes, it's exactly like that.

269
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:31,045
Ostentatious, showoff-y.

270
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,947
I don't want this junk.

271
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:33,948
I'm a wife.

272
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:35,850
But I'm no wifey.

273
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:38,920
You know, wifey with a smile

274
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:41,956
across your face and
a trick up your sleeve.

275
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,058
Submissive, yet controlling.

276
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,793
You know the type.

277
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:47,494
I don't have a television.

278
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:49,229
(Billy whistles)
Babe.

279
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:51,331
Billy, my love!

280
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:52,834
Use the hidden key.

281
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:56,336
[Billy] Yes,
but where's it hidden, Maureen?

282
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,338
[Maureen]
Try the plant. No...

283
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:02,275
Try the rock.
The big boy right there.

284
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,616
Oh, those aren't for us girls.

285
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:11,284
(Billy whistles)

286
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:14,122
[Billy] There's no key out here,
Maureen.

287
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,256
Your husband
doesn't have his own key?

288
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,059
Daddy doesn't need a key.

289
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,594
He needs a map.

290
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:20,728
That's Billy.

291
00:19:20,862 --> 00:19:22,262
He's taking me out.

292
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:23,998
Your husband take you out?

293
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:25,298
Sure.

294
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,768
When we get there,

295
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:28,435
he doesn't really
want to talk to me.

296
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:29,904
What am I thinking?

297
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:32,006
Mel has the hidden key.

298
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,074
Oh, poor Billy.

299
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,474
Hold on!

300
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,544
Hold on!

301
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:39,681
Where's Arthur, I wonder?

302
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:40,915
He's in bed.

303
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,917
Oh.
Who's bed, I wonder?

304
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:44,184
Doesn't matter.

305
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,953
Hand me my purse.

306
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:50,058
Your husband's tender, right?

307
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,491
He doesn't want to own you.

308
00:19:51,626 --> 00:19:54,361
He just wants
to love you, right?

309
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,332
You've done your best
to find a sensitive type,

310
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:01,069
an artistic soul.

311
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,470
He'd never knock you around.

312
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:06,908
That's exactly
what you wanted, isn't it?

313
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,442
Somebody gentle.

314
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:13,447
Here.

315
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:20,722
But, but men
are the executors of history.

316
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,024
They're the doers.

317
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:25,225
The performers, you know?

318
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,195
They instigate.

319
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,063
They disrupt.

320
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:30,631
They fuck.

321
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:34,434
Now none of us want a goon.

322
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:36,537
I mean, none of us want an oaf.

323
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:43,410
But what if you just
want to get a little choked?

324
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:45,445
You know, just a little choked.

325
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,414
Not too tight.

326
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:50,885
Just, you know, for fun.

327
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,493
(moans)

328
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:02,930
(music intensifies)

329
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:08,468
Baby, please.

330
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,943
Problem with pleasures.

331
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:17,845
What do you do for leisure?

332
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:25,787
Well, you can't have it
both ways with men,

333
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,888
can you?

334
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:28,256
Can you?

335
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:30,357
[Billy] It's the wrong key,
darling!

336
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,959
The wrong key, you dummy!

337
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:34,629
What did I give him,
the key to my hope chest?

338
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:35,730
Geez.

339
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,400
Here. Just take
the whole batch.

340
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,005
(Maureen sighs deeply)

341
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:45,773
You like all this junk?

342
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:48,643
I've never even seen
a dishwasher.

343
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:50,912
I must have washed
20 dishes tonight.

344
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:52,412
Maybe 25.

345
00:21:53,815 --> 00:21:54,682
Swell.

346
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,551
All right.
Here's the plan.

347
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:59,554
You know when you're a kid

348
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:03,323
and you have
this idea of trouble?

349
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,159
You know, like, thinking
you're in trouble

350
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:06,627
with your mama or pops?

351
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:09,764
Well, it's the worst thing
imaginable.

352
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:12,834
And then you grow up,
you become a woman.

353
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:15,837
And who's left to get
in trouble with?

354
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:20,473
Somehow with all
of that being true,

355
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:23,611
I've still got myself
in some trouble.

356
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,949
But don't you worry about me
because I'm gonna be in Europe.

357
00:22:28,082 --> 00:22:30,885
You're going to take the key
from Billy on your way out.

358
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,754
I'll jet,
and you'll feed Taffeta.

359
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:36,991
She's a Burmese,
a very fussy little puss.

360
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:38,593
Oh, I don't like cats.

361
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:40,628
Arthur says because
I'm basically a cat, like,

362
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:43,297
I hate water
and other cats and all dogs.

363
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,498
Oh, well, she's a beast.

364
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:46,868
She's a terror.

365
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:49,270
And you are gonna hate her good.

366
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:53,941
And you can use any
of these clunky old sex toys.

367
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:56,577
All right, you want
one of those muscle rags?

368
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:58,079
- [Billy] Dummy.
- Oh, no.

369
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,648
Arthur isn't interested
in physical fitness.

370
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:02,617
Well, we'll just give them
all to Billy.

371
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,118
He'll love us forever.

372

hysterically)

376
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,434
There you go.
Harder, harder.

Come on.

00:24:51,726 --> 00:24:53,493
Come dance with me.

382
00:24:57,932 --> 00:24:59,767
Thought you like bunnies.

383
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:03,104
Sure do.

384
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:04,505
(chuckles)

385
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:05,673
How about puppies?

386
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:07,108
Yeah, I do.

387
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:10,077
And how
about a little baby bear cub?

388
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:14,515
(gasps) Bears are just horrible.

389
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:16,851
I hate bears.

390
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:18,552
All right, well,
there's no bears here.

391
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:20,121
Look, see?
There's no bears here.

392
00:25:20,254 --> 00:25:21,188
All right?

393
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:22,423
Now go on.
Take it.

394
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:24,191
It's yours.
You can have it.

395
00:25:27,328 --> 00:25:29,330
I like your pictures.

396
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:30,831
All right, well,

397
00:25:30,965 --> 00:25:34,135
turn around
so I can blow you a little kiss.

398
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:35,803
Just one little kiss.

399
00:25:49,116 --> 00:25:50,484

400
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:52,219
Hey, blow me a kiss back.

401
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:58,959
Come on, blow me a kiss back.
Come on.

402
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:03,597
Hey, blow him a kiss,
you dumb tramp.

403
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:05,566
Bring your tight ass
back over here

404
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:07,101

He watched the male wasp

436
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:24,506
forever and ever
and found nothing,

00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:25,940
no behavior.

in getting away with anything.

I wouldn't say that.

You didn't.

I meant, can you keep
something like a secret?

00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:03,404
Which secret?

469
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,141

[Ida] And why would
a sensitive soul like you

540
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:01,435
be looking to pick a fight?

541
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:03,638
Because I'm misunderstood!

542
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,474
(chuckles)

543
00:35:07,675 --> 00:35:08,943
[Dickie]
Just read the poem, okay?

544
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:10,310
But start from the beginning.

545
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:11,779
I want to hear
the stuff about...

546
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:13,380
about the gum stuck
on the yellow cab.

547
00:35:13,514 --> 00:35:15,482
Dickie, I want
to dance. (whimpers)

548
00:35:15,617 --> 00:35:17,919
I wasn't gonna hit you.
No, stop. Don't hide from me.

549
00:35:18,052 --> 00:35:19,754
Look at me. I'm
sensitive. I'm a gentleman.

550
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:21,889
[Les] Hey, how did you know
about tonight?

551
00:35:22,023 --> 00:35:24,092
Who invited you?

552
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:25,593
We're friends of Arthur's.

553
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:30,565
[Les] Arthur, who's this kid?

554
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:33,001
[Baker] Yeah,
Arthur, help us out here.

555
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:34,969
I said we're friends.

556
00:35:35,103 --> 00:35:36,571
You don't got to push it.

557
00:35:36,704 --> 00:35:38,405
[Baker] He's one of them
street killers, ain't he?

558
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:40,875
He's in that street gang.

559
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:42,877
(glass shattering)

560
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:44,712
(woman screams)

561
00:35:47,515 --> 00:35:48,549
(glass shattering)

562
00:35:48,683 --> 00:35:51,351
(several women screaming)

563
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:55,222
Yeah.

564
00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:58,026
Let's go back.

565
00:35:58,158 --> 00:35:59,861
Give the boys a while longer.

566
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:02,697
Well, you just might end up
with that sock in the eye

567
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,965
you've been asking for.

568
00:36:04,098 --> 00:36:05,667
Maybe I want to be feared.

569
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,267
Maybe I want to be imposing.

570
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:09,871
Yeah.
Impressive.

571
00:36:10,004 --> 00:36:13,641
Ida, tell me,
how does a woman get respected?

572
00:36:13,775 --> 00:36:14,474
Easy.

573
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:17,045
Just be very boring.

574
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,147
Men respect anything
that bores them.

575
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:21,314
I've been
having these fantasies.

576
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:23,316
Fantasies where you smash open
a guy's head

577
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,953
with a bottle of Schlitz?

578
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:28,355
See, this is
where you're all backwards.

579
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:31,258
We are the fantasy.

580
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:33,795
We're smart.
We like to get off.

581
00:36:33,928 --> 00:36:37,264
We don't got to mince
or whimper or hop around

582
00:36:37,397 --> 00:36:39,867
in high-heeled shoes
to get our way.

583
00:36:41,836 --> 00:36:43,638
We're choice.

584
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:46,774
I sure want a more important
job than making Arthur happy.

585
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:48,910
(speaking indistinctly
and laughing in phone booth)

586
00:36:49,043 --> 00:36:51,679
Your importance to Arthur
has far more to do

587
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:55,083
with how much you can hurt him
than how happy you can make him.

588
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:56,584
What is our marriage then?

589
00:36:56,718 --> 00:36:58,251
A strange sort of friendship
that started out

590
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:01,656
with a few sexual privileges?

591
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:04,692
Yeah.

592
00:37:04,826 --> 00:37:06,259
That's marriage.

593
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:09,797
Well, I'm through being sexy.

594
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:11,298
Ugh...

595
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:14,135
How long can anyone be sexy
for anyway?

596
00:37:14,267 --> 00:37:16,170
Even men.

597
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:18,172
Although they'll always
have debonair.

598
00:37:18,305 --> 00:37:19,907
[woman in booth]
Heh, I'm sorry...

599
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:21,374
Never have debonair.

600
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:24,311
If I was a man,
I'd buy a leather jacket.

601
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:25,513
Nice and tough.

602
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:27,648
Well, I am definitely a woman,

603
00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:29,784
and I certainly enjoy it.

604
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:32,587
I especially
enjoy female friendships.

605
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,423
All that flattery
and flirting, gushes of lies,

606
00:37:36,557 --> 00:37:38,693
and lovely words
that don't mean a thing.

607
00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:39,627
Thrilling sport.

608
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:41,896
I mean what I say to you.

609
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:44,364
When?

610
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:45,298
[woman in booth]
Please, help!

611
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:49,504
(sobbing)

612
00:37:55,877 --> 00:37:56,944
Give me a dime.

613
00:37:58,378 --> 00:38:01,381
I need a fucking dime for love.

614
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:07,387
(coins jingling and clanging)

615
00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:09,289
Street corner.

616
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:11,826
Filled with fantasy.

617
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,661
(sobbing continues;
dialing rotary phone)

618
00:38:13,795 --> 00:38:15,763
You want to bet
she'll change his mind?

619
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:20,568
[woman in booth]
No. Please, no.

620
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:26,240
(sobbing) No.

621
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:28,341
I'm sorry.

622
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:33,748
I don't have plans and schemes.

623
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:39,587
I don't have hopes and dreams.

624
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,690

I never told him
I wanted to be alone.

646
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:59,894
I only told him
I wanted to be left alone.

647
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,765
Isn't that different?

648
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:10,171
(distant siren wailing)

649
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,974
(ominous theme playing)

650
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:14,642
(metal clanging)

651
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:17,678
(dog barking in distance)

652
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:22,750
That's probably just kids.

653
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:25,953
Bunch of boys.

654
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,391
What were you like as a boy?

655
00:41:30,524 --> 00:41:33,627
Um, same as now.

656
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:37,565
Does anyone really ever change?

657
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:39,066
Of course.

658
00:41:40,201 --> 00:41:41,936
I'm always changing.

659
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:44,405
I'd like to be
someone else entirely.

660
00:41:44,538 --> 00:41:47,308
[Arthur] It's a frightening
thing to hear from one's wife.

661
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:48,576
(metallic clanging continues)

662
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:53,147
You'd rather me be anyone else

663
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,717
in the whole entire world,
never, ever?

664
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:02,857
Well, um, that's,
that's not the same thing.

665
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:07,094
We're talking about
you being you

666
00:42:07,228 --> 00:42:08,696
while also evolving,

667
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:11,665
not about substituting you
with another person.

668
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:13,701
We're talking
about Suze as she is,

669
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:16,103
not about actual magic.

670
00:42:16,237 --> 00:42:20,674
Arthur,
play the game, won't you?

671
00:42:20,808 --> 00:42:22,410
No, I don't feel like being

672
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:24,712
put under extreme pressure
tonight.

673
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:26,313
You're angry with me.

674
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:29,617
I told you I wasn't.
Only you don't believe me.

675
00:42:30,718 --> 00:42:32,119
You love me then?

676
00:42:34,088 --> 00:42:36,457
I'm...

677
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,759
I'm sensitive to atmosphere.

678
00:42:40,428 --> 00:42:42,730
No.
You know I love you.

679
00:42:43,597 --> 00:42:46,067
That's implied.

680
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,537
But we can't do something
completely out of character

681
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:49,904
and expect me to understand.

682
00:42:50,037 --> 00:42:52,239
(dogs howling;
object crashes)

683
00:42:52,373 --> 00:42:53,474
(glass shatters)

684
00:42:53,607 --> 00:42:56,010
(dog yelping)

685
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:00,147
So you good on me then?

686
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,052
I love you for now, Suze.

687
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:11,025
But I'm getting real nervous
about the you that's coming.

688
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,396
But you'll change, too.

689
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,598
- Into what?
- I don't know.

690
00:43:18,899 --> 00:43:21,302
We'll change into each other.
Isn't that what happens?

691
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:23,137
(glass shatters)

692
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:29,043
(door creaks)

693
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:32,213
Oh, no.
Suze!

694
00:43:40,754 --> 00:43:42,156
I'm walking downstairs.

695
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:43,624
I don't care at all!

696
00:43:43,757 --> 00:43:45,594
You care that
I'm asking you not to?

697
00:43:45,726 --> 00:43:47,194
All show and no go!

698
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:48,563
They would have killed us
already if they wanted.

699
00:43:48,696 --> 00:43:50,197
We know that.

700
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:51,699
Thinking we're thicker
than a Five Dollar Molly,

701
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:53,267
but we're not.

702
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,404
You're looking for a fist
in the face, Suze.

703
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:01,809
(Stanley Kowalski voice) I'm the king
around here, and don't you forget it.

704
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:04,345
Suze?

705
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:10,050
I'm the king around here,
and don't you forget it!

706
00:44:19,594 --> 00:44:22,897
(tense theme playing)

707
00:44:46,588 --> 00:44:50,457
(whispering) I'm the king around
here, and don't you forget it.

708
00:46:07,101 --> 00:46:10,938
(gentle theme playing)

709
00:46:27,689 --> 00:46:29,089
They've been...

710
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:33,827
They gave us
a real working over.

711
00:46:35,764 --> 00:46:38,866
Your pad just seemed like
a hiding kind of pad.

712
00:46:41,368 --> 00:46:43,837
Can we hide in here
with you for a while?

713
00:46:45,005 --> 00:46:47,007
(door creaks open)

714
00:46:47,141 --> 00:46:49,843
They weren't even there.
Must have...

715
00:46:55,617 --> 00:46:57,519
Time to split, Teddy.

716
00:47:07,562 --> 00:47:08,495
(light snarl)

717
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,130
(keys jingling)

718
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,575
It's not such a palace.

719
00:47:40,729 --> 00:47:42,162
My keys...

720
00:47:44,264 --> 00:47:47,868
My keys!

721
00:47:54,975 --> 00:47:57,612
(intense theme playing)

722
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:13,595
Arthur!

723
00:48:19,868 --> 00:48:21,569
(thunder rumbling)

724
00:48:23,103 --> 00:48:27,007
(people vocalizing)

725
00:49:35,008 --> 00:49:37,177
(sizzling)

726
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,189
(sizzling)

727
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:11,438
(slow jazz music playing)

728
00:51:47,341 --> 00:51:50,444
I feel I should be
invited to sit down.

729
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:58,385
(exhales, mimics gunshot)

730
00:52:03,057 --> 00:52:04,559
Billy.

731
00:52:07,095 --> 00:52:09,030
Ugh,

732
00:52:09,162 --> 00:52:10,531
I am surely on the make,

733
00:52:10,665 --> 00:52:13,467
and there is absolutely
nothing doing.

734
00:52:14,669 --> 00:52:16,370
Seemed like maybe I was here
on the wrong night,

735
00:52:16,504 --> 00:52:18,072
and then I run into you two.

736
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:20,041
And, um,

737
00:52:20,173 --> 00:52:22,476
well, maybe that's
not for nothing.

738
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:25,278
You on a sweetheart date?

739
00:52:25,412 --> 00:52:26,848
Arthur brought me.

740
00:52:26,981 --> 00:52:28,348
Oh...

741
00:52:28,482 --> 00:52:30,317
Saw the address
in the back of a matchbook,

742
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:31,719
thought we'd like it.

743
00:52:31,853 --> 00:52:33,121
Call me old-fashioned,

744
00:52:33,253 --> 00:52:36,189
but I love when
a man takes the lead.

745
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:39,627
(chuckles) Oh, well,
that's not Arthur.

746
00:52:39,761 --> 00:52:42,462
[Billy] Well,
then Arthur's a bum.

747
00:52:43,931 --> 00:52:46,500
[Suze] You know, it might
sound corny to you,

748
00:52:46,634 --> 00:52:49,671
but Arthur refuses to be a man.

749
00:52:49,804 --> 00:52:52,305
Well, Arthur, if you're
not a man, what are you?

750
00:52:52,439 --> 00:52:54,241
I... I am a man.

751
00:52:54,374 --> 00:52:58,546
I just don't feel
the need to act male.

752
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,816
It's hard to believe
I was even born male. Heh.

753
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:05,019
I've never been
enough of a genuine man

754
00:53:05,153 --> 00:53:06,353
to suggest I am one.

755
00:53:06,486 --> 00:53:10,158
So maybe I'm not one.

756
00:53:10,323 --> 00:53:11,959
Boy, what a kick.

757
00:53:12,093 --> 00:53:15,395
But you're not a woman.
You're not a woman, Arthur.

758
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:20,200
Of course he's not a woman.
Gak.

759
00:53:21,669 --> 00:53:23,838
Here's a question
for you, Billy.

760
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:25,238
Hmm.

761
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:26,774
What is a man, anyway?

762
00:53:26,908 --> 00:53:30,310
Ooh, ring a ding, ding, ding.

763
00:53:30,444 --> 00:53:32,479
Well, I suppose we could start

764
00:53:32,613 --> 00:53:35,282
with an inspection of the groin.

765
00:53:35,415 --> 00:53:37,384
No, I, I think that's baloney.

766
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:39,286
It's not only expected

767
00:53:39,419 --> 00:53:41,055
that I identify with other men,

768
00:53:41,189 --> 00:53:42,557
but it's also implied

769
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:45,325
I'm not allowed
to identify with women.

770
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:47,061
I can't share
any of their feelings

771
00:53:47,195 --> 00:53:50,565
or interests because we're
supposed to be opposites.

772
00:53:50,698 --> 00:53:52,767
Well, what about fucking?

773
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:57,270
I mean, doesn't fucking make
you feel like more of a fucking man?

774
00:54:00,174 --> 00:54:04,979
Sometimes it feels like
Suze is inside of me.

775
00:54:05,113 --> 00:54:08,816
(Billy chuckles; Suze laughs)

776
00:54:11,085 --> 00:54:12,419
Mm.

777
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:15,322
You know, I have
a terrific theory on this.

778
00:54:18,626 --> 00:54:20,628
And some blue night,

779
00:54:20,762 --> 00:54:23,164
I'm gonna tell you all about it.

780
00:54:23,296 --> 00:54:26,067
No, tell us now. We want
to hear the theory right now!

781
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,202
No, you bossy little cow.

782
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:29,704
We'll buy you a drink.

783
00:54:29,837 --> 00:54:31,438
Do I look like I want
to spend my night

784
00:54:31,572 --> 00:54:33,808
teaching a dip
and his dyke how to be cool?

785
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:35,042
Good night, Billy.

786
00:54:35,176 --> 00:54:37,612
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No.

787
00:54:37,745 --> 00:54:39,379
Let's have another gin rickey

788
00:54:39,514 --> 00:54:41,348
and Arthur will dance with you.

789
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:44,819
Planet Manhattan to Saturn Suzy,

790
00:54:45,987 --> 00:54:50,490
your husband's here
for someone else.

791
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:53,161
I knew that.

792
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:54,695
[Billy]
Well, if you know that, then...

793
00:54:54,829 --> 00:54:57,430
what are you two doing
living the big lie?

794
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,300
We love each other.

795
00:55:00,433 --> 00:55:03,538
(Billy laughs)

796
00:55:03,671 --> 00:55:07,041
Oh, boy.
Oh, that is a tickle.

797
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,845
Sit down, sister!

798
00:55:11,879 --> 00:55:14,916
I am not your sister, mister.

799
00:55:15,049 --> 00:55:17,384
And he doesn't act like a woman.

800
00:55:17,518 --> 00:55:21,823
He acts like a queer.
Same for you.

801
00:55:22,924 --> 00:55:24,025
(Suze grunts)

802
00:55:24,158 --> 00:55:25,860
(glasses shatter)

803
00:55:26,894 --> 00:55:28,395
[Suze] We put
in our appearances!

804
00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:30,998
We put in our parts
our whole lives.

805
00:55:31,132 --> 00:55:32,499
We are art, Arthur.

806
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:35,203
I'd buy us
and I'd hang us on a wall.

807
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:37,605
Man and wife, 1956, Who would...

808
00:55:37,738 --> 00:55:39,273
(object clatters)

809
00:55:39,406 --> 00:55:41,408
(whispers)
Who would buy that?

810
00:55:45,947 --> 00:55:48,082
(Joanne sobbing)

811
00:55:58,826 --> 00:56:02,597
Listen, Joanne, you said
you'd be our eye roll.

812
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,599
All right, the only reason
the Gents let you come along

813
00:56:04,732 --> 00:56:05,967
is 'cause
this is your pop's car,

814
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,702
so you got to can it.

815
00:56:07,835 --> 00:56:09,303
You got to take all your tears,

816
00:56:09,436 --> 00:56:11,038
and you got to throw 'em
in the ash can.

817
00:56:11,172 --> 00:56:12,874
You hear me?

818
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:18,980
You're degenerates!
You're apes!

819
00:56:19,113 --> 00:56:21,515
[Dickie] Hey! If they're apes,
then I'm an ape.

820
00:56:21,649 --> 00:56:23,117
Why did you even like me
in the first place?

821
00:56:23,251 --> 00:56:25,119
You know, you know
I was a tense young man.

822
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:27,255
You know I was tough
to get to the center of.

823
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:29,590
But that's what
a girl does, Dickie.

824
00:56:29,724 --> 00:56:32,593
She makes a pretty poodle
out of a salty dog.

825
00:56:32,727 --> 00:56:36,697
I mean, you're around now,
but you're gonna change.

826
00:56:36,831 --> 00:56:38,398
Either you're both deluded

827
00:56:38,532 --> 00:56:41,002
or everyone in
the human race is deluded.

828
00:56:41,135 --> 00:56:43,204
You can't make
a Mickey Mouse eat.

829
00:56:43,337 --> 00:56:45,106
If you did, you'd drop him.

830
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:46,741
Sure thing.

831
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:51,212
Dickie, stand up for me.
Tell him.

832
00:56:51,345 --> 00:56:52,914
[man 1]
This is just like Bev.

833
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:57,285
This is exactly, like,
Swanky Bev in a real mansion.

834
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:59,053
Yeah. Yeah,
Bev kept saying

835
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:00,888
there's no such thing
as a real man.

836
00:57:01,022 --> 00:57:02,924
Like, guys all got together
and made the whole thing

837
00:57:03,057 --> 00:57:05,326
of being guys up...
Like, I was a goof

838
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:08,663
wearing some man mask
trying to outdo everyone.

839
00:57:08,796 --> 00:57:10,798
Like, we was all trying
to outdo each other.

840
00:57:10,932 --> 00:57:13,200
Not just the Young Gents,
but also all the men,

841
00:57:13,334 --> 00:57:14,368
all of them, everywhere.

842
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:15,736
[man 1] She wanted a father.

843
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:17,470
- Boy, did she ever.
- [man 2 laughs]

844
00:57:17,605 --> 00:57:19,240
Well, what's feeling
real, anyway?

845
00:57:19,373 --> 00:57:22,810
No, Teddy, you're a true blue.

846
00:57:24,412 --> 00:57:26,180
You're a sappy honeybee.

847
00:57:28,716 --> 00:57:29,750
You got a girl?

848
00:57:29,884 --> 00:57:32,520
Dickie, shut her up.

849
00:57:33,421 --> 00:57:34,689
How about this?

850
00:57:34,822 --> 00:57:37,692
You boys love a competition,
right?

851
00:57:37,825 --> 00:57:39,260
You want to win a prize,

852
00:57:39,393 --> 00:57:43,496
isn't that so, and prove
to each other who's best?

853
00:57:43,631 --> 00:57:46,067
How about we have
a game, a do or die,

854
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,669
and whoever wins
get something even better

855
00:57:48,803 --> 00:57:50,838
from my pops than his car parts?

856
00:57:50,972 --> 00:57:54,474
How about... his wristwatch?

857
00:57:54,608 --> 00:57:56,077
How about his daughter?

858
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:57,477
The watch is fine.

859
00:57:57,611 --> 00:57:58,813
What's the game already?

860
00:57:58,946 --> 00:58:00,514
Simple.

861
00:58:01,582 --> 00:58:06,520
You have to open yourself up.

862
00:58:06,654 --> 00:58:08,823
You have to say
something honest.

863
00:58:08,956 --> 00:58:10,758
You have to be vulnerable

864
00:58:10,891 --> 00:58:12,827
and tender with your feelings.

865
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,762
Whoever does it best wins.

866
00:58:14,895 --> 00:58:16,964
You got smog in your noggin'.

867
00:58:17,098 --> 00:58:19,533
How are you gonna
judge a thing like that?

868
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,970
We're not your damn girlfriends.

869
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:25,039
I'll do it.

870
00:58:26,374 --> 00:58:27,908
I want to do it.

871
00:58:28,042 --> 00:58:29,110
Don't.

872
00:58:30,578 --> 00:58:32,646
[Joanne]
Dickie will go first.

873
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,949
Dickie, say that thing

874
00:58:35,082 --> 00:58:37,551
that you were saying
the other night...

875
00:58:37,685 --> 00:58:39,787
about how all of you
are fighting against

876
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,789
the punishing world
and about how none of you

877
00:58:41,922 --> 00:58:43,424
ever grew up really, instead,

878
00:58:43,557 --> 00:58:47,028
you just merged together
like a pack of animals because,

879
00:58:47,161 --> 00:58:49,363
because you knew there was
something about other men

880
00:58:49,497 --> 00:58:51,032
you had to protect
yourselves from?

881
00:58:51,165 --> 00:58:53,868
[Dickie] I wasn't really
saying that, Joanne.

882
00:58:58,806 --> 00:59:00,241
I'm going first.

883
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:11,652
There's a scale

884
00:59:12,753 --> 00:59:14,188
I know you're all rating me on

885
00:59:14,321 --> 00:59:16,991
and now you got me
rating myself on it, too.

886
00:59:21,462 --> 00:59:23,197
A scale for belonging.

887
00:59:27,101 --> 00:59:29,470
I'm...

888
00:59:29,603 --> 00:59:32,640
living based on where I stand
on this fake fucking scale

889
00:59:32,773 --> 00:59:35,009
because I'm obsessed
with a lot of you.

890
00:59:37,812 --> 00:59:39,847
I'm terrified of each of you.

891
00:59:44,118 --> 00:59:46,187
I'm in agony that I don't
size up to any of you

892
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,255
because you're all
the standard of the kind of man

893
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:49,890
I got to appear to be.

894
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,367
Oh...

895
01:00:02,636 --> 01:00:03,904
No!

896
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:08,309
(wolves howling)

897
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:13,881
[Teddy] You two are already done.
Now you want to drop dead twice?

898
01:00:14,014 --> 01:00:16,117
Sweet Dickie.
Sweet Dickie and lovely Joanne.

899
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:18,052
- Get us our keys back.
- Now, can't you see

900
01:00:18,185 --> 01:00:20,054
you're playing
with the lowliest of the lot?

901
01:00:20,187 --> 01:00:21,556
They're gonna take
everything you have

902
01:00:21,689 --> 01:00:22,890
and make it their own.

903
01:00:23,023 --> 01:00:24,225
Me? I don't want
what I don't got.

904
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:25,659
But you two aren't
dealing with me.

905
01:00:25,793 --> 01:00:27,061
How about a deal though?

906
01:00:27,194 --> 01:00:28,863
We don't have
anything worth anything,

907
01:00:28,996 --> 01:00:31,098
but I know someone who does,
same building too.

908
01:00:31,232 --> 01:00:34,802
Sure you like right off
the sales floor at Gimbel's.

909
01:00:34,935 --> 01:00:37,506
Plus, they're in Europe.
Maybe even forever.

910
01:00:37,638 --> 01:00:40,207
How about their keys for ours?

911
01:00:41,275 --> 01:00:42,209
Swaps.

912
01:00:42,343 --> 01:00:44,044
She's lying, Teddy.

913
01:00:49,116 --> 01:00:50,718
The only thing we've
got in the whole world

914
01:00:50,851 --> 01:00:53,721
is the person sitting
across from us.

915
01:00:53,854 --> 01:00:55,322
And all we know
in the whole world is

916
01:00:55,456 --> 01:00:57,057
whatever that person says.

917
01:01:00,828 --> 01:01:03,697
I'll see about your swap.

918
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:07,668
Find you later.
Don't you find me.

919
01:01:39,534 --> 01:01:41,335
[Suze] Hmm.

920
01:01:41,468 --> 01:01:42,903
Okay...

921
01:01:52,614 --> 01:01:54,281
"Find you later.

922
01:01:55,816 --> 01:01:58,185
Don't you find me."

923
01:02:33,487 --> 01:02:34,822
Terrific.

924
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:38,359
Maureen's not upstairs.

925
01:02:38,492 --> 01:02:42,096
I know where
Maureen's not better than you.

926
01:02:43,732 --> 01:02:45,600
I like your get-up, stud.

927
01:02:45,734 --> 01:02:49,503
Well, look, you're
not getting my red roses.

928
01:02:49,638 --> 01:02:51,905
Move.

929
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:53,575
Just tell me
your blue night's theory.

930
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:55,776
Just tell me that
blue night's theory of yours.

931
01:02:55,909 --> 01:02:57,811
That's all.
That's it.

932
01:02:59,681 --> 01:03:00,848
We are living

933
01:03:00,981 --> 01:03:03,250
on a dying planet

934
01:03:03,384 --> 01:03:07,388
filled with
impossible obstacles.

935
01:03:24,038 --> 01:03:26,508
[Maureen] Billy baby,
get up here.

936
01:03:26,641 --> 01:03:27,474
(indistinct chatter)

937
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:31,378

[Arthur] No, don't come.
Don't come.

947
01:05:28,395 --> 01:05:30,665
Please don't come.
Please don't come to the city.

948
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,734
[Arthur's dad on phone] <i>Telling your
mother not to do what she wants to do</i>

949
01:05:32,867 --> 01:05:36,303
<i>is the best possible way
to ensure that she will do it.</i>

950
01:05:36,437 --> 01:05:38,405
<i>But that comes
as a real surprise.</i>

951
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:40,474
[Arthur] Suze and I are in
the middle of something here,

952
01:05:40,608 --> 01:05:43,110
and if I knew what it was,
I'd tell you, but I don't.

953

<i>You remember what
a happy boy you were?</i>

956
01:05:49,617 --> 01:05:51,452
No.

957
01:05:51,586 --> 01:05:53,153
<i>Son, it is our troubled minds</i>

958
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:54,556

<i>We're just the same that way.</i>

01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:00,961
(door closes)

962
01:06:20,347 --> 01:06:22,550
Arthur is an outsider.

963
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:26,153
What's the matter with him?

964
01:06:28,756 --> 01:06:30,390
Is he...

965
01:06:31,325 --> 01:06:33,494
too wrapped up in himself?

966
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:36,631
Should we just

967
01:06:36,764 --> 01:06:39,333
count him out
for good from now on?

968
01:06:43,136 --> 01:06:44,438
Is it because
he looks different?

969
01:06:44,572 --> 01:06:48,543
Is it some particular
way he acts?

970
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,345
If he can just make up his mind

971
01:06:51,478 --> 01:06:52,947
not to be an always outsider,

972
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,250
then the gang will easily accept

973
01:06:57,084 --> 01:06:58,720
and invite him in.

974
01:07:05,192 --> 01:07:06,561
Sure.

975
01:07:09,229 --> 01:07:11,265
That sounds swell.

976
01:07:14,234 --> 01:07:16,370
I want to be a happy boy.

977
01:07:17,906 --> 01:07:22,209
I don't have to certify
my sex to either sex.

978
01:07:22,342 --> 01:07:24,979
I want to feel comfortable
in the company of men

979
01:07:25,112 --> 01:07:29,116
without having to prove
that I'm a caveman and I've...

980
01:07:29,249 --> 01:07:31,184
(whimpers)

981
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:33,955
I've done that job, haven't I?

982
01:07:34,087 --> 01:07:35,055
I got married, didn't I?

983
01:07:35,188 --> 01:07:36,524
I'm a...

984
01:07:36,658 --> 01:07:38,793
I'm a tenderhearted husband,
aren't I?

985
01:07:38,927 --> 01:07:40,260
I, I love my wife, don't I?

986
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:42,664
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna die in her arms.

Won't I?

988
01:07:44,832 --> 01:07:47,200
Won't I, Dad?

989
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:49,637
Dad?

990
01:07:57,011 --> 01:07:58,546
Will I?

No.

1005
01:08:36,851 --> 01:08:38,151

(howls)

1010
01:09:09,117 --> 01:09:10,652
I got a stub.

1011
01:09:17,592 --> 01:09:19,393
Ticket for a show maybe?

1012
01:09:20,795 --> 01:09:22,764
Screenings nightly of Bijou 52

1013
01:09:22,897 --> 01:09:24,431
are from 9:00 p.m.
to 4:00 a.m.

1014
01:09:24,565 --> 01:09:26,801
Tonight's films are <i>Boy Convict</i>

1015
01:09:26,934 --> 01:09:28,235
and <i>Wrestle the Devil.</i>

1016
01:09:28,368 --> 01:09:29,937
The next
showing's in six minutes.

1017
01:09:30,071 --> 01:09:32,674
That's $1 plus $0.15.

1018
01:09:32,807 --> 01:09:36,911
Hey, can you
just let me peek a head in?

1019
01:09:37,045 --> 01:09:39,212
I want to see if there's
someone in there that I know.

1020
01:09:39,346 --> 01:09:40,948
Hmm...

1021
01:09:47,588 --> 01:09:51,092
You look just like
my husband Arthur.

1022
01:09:51,224 --> 01:09:52,392
Hmm.

1023
01:09:52,527 --> 01:09:53,828
Poor Arthur.

1024
01:09:53,961 --> 01:09:55,563
(snickers)

1025
01:09:55,697 --> 01:09:57,965
Give me two dollars
to peek your head in.

1026
01:09:58,099 --> 01:10:00,400
Before,
it was $1.15 before.

1027
01:10:00,535 --> 01:10:02,003
Oh, you're in there to bite.

1028
01:10:02,136 --> 01:10:07,274
Dollar fifteen for boys
and two dollars for girls.

1029

1030
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:42,744
(woman laughing)

1031
01:10:54,488 --> 01:10:56,456
Hey, do you mind telling me

1032
01:10:56,591 --> 01:10:58,960
if you know a guy named Teddy?

1033
01:10:59,093 --> 01:11:00,460
Usually wears a leather jacket

1034
01:11:00,595 --> 01:11:03,463
with the words "Young Gents"
on the back.

1035
01:11:04,232 --> 01:11:05,700
Is that your husband?

1036
01:11:07,235 --> 01:11:09,637
Yeah, he is.

1037
01:11:09,771 --> 01:11:11,239
Does he know you're a boochie?

1038
01:11:11,371 --> 01:11:14,008
Heh. I'm not though.

1039
01:11:14,142 --> 01:11:15,643
Heh. Yeah.

1040
01:11:15,777 --> 01:11:18,045
So what'd your husband do
to have you

1041
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:20,047
chasing him down here?

1042
01:11:20,181 --> 01:11:21,516
Unless down here

1043
01:11:21,649 --> 01:11:23,818
is the reason why
you're chasing him.

1044
01:11:26,754 --> 01:11:29,991
This constant desire to couple.

1045
01:11:32,927 --> 01:11:34,862
It's so strong.

1046
01:11:34,996 --> 01:11:37,497
It's like
constant companionship.

1047
01:11:37,632 --> 01:11:41,836
And then you forget yourself,
the self, you know?

1048
01:11:41,969 --> 01:11:43,704
Couple up to forget
about the condition

1049
01:11:43,838 --> 01:11:46,674
of being human
and all the pains,

1050
01:11:46,808 --> 01:11:49,710
plus how damn difficult
it is to survive.

1051
01:11:49,844 --> 01:11:51,311
Hmm...

1052
01:11:53,915 --> 01:11:55,817
My husband,

1053
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:57,752
uh, Teddy,

1054
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,522
he's been so gentle with me,

1055
01:12:01,656 --> 01:12:04,592
even when I wanted
to be rough with him.

1056
01:12:06,127 --> 01:12:07,995
(exhales)

1057
01:12:08,129 --> 01:12:10,298
How am I ever
gonna give it to him

1058
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:12,332
the way he wants to get it?

1059
01:12:26,681 --> 01:12:27,915
I'm gonna ask him.

1060
01:12:28,049 --> 01:12:29,917
Hey, are you
writing a book here?

1061
01:12:30,051 --> 01:12:32,086
Take a quick peep
around, Warden.

1062
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:34,255
None of these Joe Does
want to talk to you.

1063
01:12:34,387 --> 01:12:37,925
They don't even like gals.
They're not here to flirt.

1064
01:12:40,393 --> 01:12:43,097
(projector whirring)

1065
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:58,378
Hey, do you know
a guy named Teddy?

1066
01:13:00,715 --> 01:13:03,117
The Young Gents.
You heard of that?

1067
01:13:07,021 --> 01:13:09,422
I know those degenerates.

1068
01:13:09,557 --> 01:13:10,658
You do?

1069
01:13:10,791 --> 01:13:12,159
Do you know Teddy?

1070
01:13:12,293 --> 01:13:13,628
Do you know
if he's coming here tonight?

1071
01:13:13,761 --> 01:13:15,462
I don't know Teddy

1072
01:13:15,596 --> 01:13:18,566
from Freddy from Serengeti.

1073
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:22,103
But, boy, did I hand it
to one of 'em

1074
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:24,238
just last month.

1075
01:13:24,372 --> 01:13:26,607
Sure messed 'em up bad.

1076
01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:28,709
Still makes me a little,

1077
01:13:28,843 --> 01:13:31,512
you know, sick
to think about it.

1078
01:13:39,452 --> 01:13:40,922
You should really beat it.

1079
01:13:41,055 --> 01:13:43,490
No fooling, miss.

1080
01:13:43,624 --> 01:13:46,661
I'm just gonna wait here
for Teddy, thank you.

1081
01:13:52,767 --> 01:13:54,467
What's your bag, man?

1082
01:13:54,602 --> 01:13:56,671
You're not hearing me.

1083
01:13:56,804 --> 01:13:59,840
You're sitting in a room
full of criminal queers.

1084
01:14:02,143 --> 01:14:05,880
I'm gonna blow
my whistle in five seconds.

1085
01:14:06,013 --> 01:14:08,582
You're gonna want
to cut out in three.

1086
01:14:11,484 --> 01:14:13,087
Do I look like a bear?

1087
01:14:14,422 --> 01:14:16,057
Or do I look like a pig?

1088
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:20,728
(sighs)

1089
01:14:31,505 --> 01:14:34,108
(whistle blowing)

1090
01:14:34,241 --> 01:14:36,711
(people screaming)

1091
01:14:39,113 --> 01:14:41,682
Run! Run!

1092
01:14:43,017 --> 01:14:46,754
(people clamoring)
Run! Run!

1093
01:14:49,323 --> 01:14:52,560
(air raid sirens wailing)

1094
01:14:52,693 --> 01:14:54,662
(police sirens blaring)

1095
01:15:03,503 --> 01:15:05,239
(police sirens fading)

1096
01:15:15,549 --> 01:15:17,718
Caught you.

1097
01:15:17,852 --> 01:15:21,422
I... um, I caught
you following me.

1098
01:15:21,555 --> 01:15:25,092
Following her.
That bunny lives to hop.

1099
01:15:25,226 --> 01:15:26,160
(chuckles)

1100
01:15:26,293 --> 01:15:27,728
Yeah.

1101
01:15:27,862 --> 01:15:29,196
She thinks she's the big dick

1102
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:31,532
solving some kind of
great whatsit.

1103
01:15:31,665 --> 01:15:33,467
Yeah, white hot thrills.

1104
01:15:33,601 --> 01:15:37,104
Well, I don't got her keys,
though I do have her man.

1105
01:15:41,008 --> 01:15:42,276
Um...

1106
01:15:43,644 --> 01:15:45,880
what y'all did to that girl

1107
01:15:47,615 --> 01:15:49,150
was deranged.

1108
01:15:50,251 --> 01:15:51,152
What's deranged?

1109
01:15:51,285 --> 01:15:53,487
It's, it's like whacko.

1110
01:15:53,621 --> 01:15:55,456
Like unzipped.

1111
01:15:55,589 --> 01:15:59,126
Say, want to lose control?

1112
01:16:02,196 --> 01:16:04,198
I'm, I'm, um...

1113
01:16:04,331 --> 01:16:06,167
I'm, I'm not in control.

1114
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,235
You know,

1115
01:16:08,369 --> 01:16:10,137
there's playing it cool

1116
01:16:10,938 --> 01:16:12,840
and then there's just...

1117
01:16:13,774 --> 01:16:16,844
being cool.

1118
01:16:20,347 --> 01:16:23,951
Yeah. Um, I, I play
the clarinet.

1119
01:16:24,418 --> 01:16:25,554
Play me.

1120
01:16:25,686 --> 01:16:28,523
Play with me.
See how I wail.

1121
01:16:28,656 --> 01:16:30,124
Who made you?

1122
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:34,228
Angel or devil?

1123
01:16:35,996 --> 01:16:37,731
You got to draw a line.

1124
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:41,235
So you know where the line is...

1125
01:16:42,436 --> 01:16:44,205
when you cross it.

1126
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:47,675
You ever crossed it, bean?

1127
01:16:49,777 --> 01:16:51,946
Maybe for one
of those boys in your band?

1128
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,583
No. Um...

1129
01:16:54,715 --> 01:16:56,750
I never gave them
a second thought.

1130
01:16:56,884 --> 01:16:59,053
(whispers) You ever given
them a first thought?

1131
01:17:01,655 --> 01:17:05,092
Teddy, angel,

1132
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,162
you don't have to be a killer.

1133
01:17:09,897 --> 01:17:12,099
At least I'm not
an artist, stiff.

1134
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:14,735
I am stiff.

1135
01:17:18,038 --> 01:17:20,341
You could be my favorite.

1136
01:17:21,709 --> 01:17:23,844
Favorite favorite?

1137
01:17:33,354 --> 01:17:37,825
(classical Latin dance
theme playing)

1138
01:18:09,323 --> 01:18:12,726
(music continues)

1139
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:41,722
(woman laughing)

1140
01:18:41,855 --> 01:18:45,259
Oh, it'll pass.

1141
01:18:47,662 --> 01:18:50,364
Said the crying man
to his subway train.

1142
01:18:50,497 --> 01:18:52,800
(woman gasps)

1143
01:18:57,271 --> 01:18:58,640
(blows striking; fighting)

1144
01:18:58,772 --> 01:19:00,975
Geez, Teddy.

1145
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:05,379
(woman screaming)

1146
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:16,357
(door opens)

1147
01:19:19,527 --> 01:19:21,128
Suze...

1148
01:19:22,963 --> 01:19:24,832
you're my wife.

1149
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,402
And you're a wondrous thing.

1150
01:19:30,004 --> 01:19:33,007
We're not squares,
we're someone else.

1151
01:19:34,676 --> 01:19:36,010
But I'm on the hook for you,

1152
01:19:36,143 --> 01:19:37,411
and you're on the hook from me.

1153
01:19:37,545 --> 01:19:41,815
And we can love,
like, crazy, like wow!

1154
01:19:43,984 --> 01:19:46,220
We just have to figure it out.

1155
01:19:48,222 --> 01:19:50,558
We're gonna figure
this all out together,

1156
01:19:50,692 --> 01:19:53,127
and then it's gonna be unreal.

1157
01:19:58,432 --> 01:20:00,067
Suze?

1158
01:20:01,468 --> 01:20:03,237
Hey, Suze?

1159
01:20:06,775 --> 01:20:08,409
[Suze] I'm home, duck.

1160
01:20:10,144 --> 01:20:12,046
Come to bed, will you?

1161
01:20:22,657 --> 01:20:25,560
Did you lock the door?

1162
01:20:25,694 --> 01:20:29,997
[Suze] What's the fucking point
in locking the fucking door?

1163
01:20:36,236 --> 01:20:38,640
<i>♪ Please, baby, please ♪</i>

1164
01:20:38,773 --> 01:20:41,609
[Suze] <i>Arthur!</i>

1165
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:01,830
So, Arthur, how's that
clarinet? Still broken?

1166
01:21:01,962 --> 01:21:03,964
- [Arthur] Still broken.
- Still broken.

1167
01:21:04,098 --> 01:21:08,502
Tell your old man you broke
his piece, get in loads of trouble.

1168
01:21:10,003 --> 01:21:12,940
[Arthur] We're grownups.

1169
01:21:13,073 --> 01:21:14,609
[Suze] There's no such thing
as trouble.

1170
01:21:14,743 --> 01:21:16,210
(scoffs)

1171
01:21:17,311 --> 01:21:19,514
Then stop punishing us.

1172
01:21:20,682 --> 01:21:22,182
I'll do whatever I want

1173
01:21:22,316 --> 01:21:24,184
'cause I'm a wild one.

1174
01:21:24,318 --> 01:21:27,054
Yeah, wild and free.

1175
01:21:35,663 --> 01:21:41,068
Heart and ribs
like bird and cage.

1176
01:21:42,236 --> 01:21:44,672
When it flutters, set it free.

1177
01:21:50,812 --> 01:21:53,981
No one's trying to lick
you into shape, Susan dear.

1178
01:21:54,114 --> 01:21:55,683
[Ida] I think we're all
just very lucky that

1179
01:21:55,817 --> 01:21:58,653
the sharpest knife on
the table's for spreading jam.

1180
01:21:58,787 --> 01:22:01,589
Yeah, I think Ida's saying
we don't need all the...

1181
01:22:01,723 --> 01:22:03,023
the, the friction.

1182
01:22:03,157 --> 01:22:04,958
[Suze] Let her say
what she's saying.

1183
01:22:05,092 --> 01:22:07,461
I'm saying, screw.

1184
01:22:09,129 --> 01:22:11,498
(banging on the door)

1185
01:22:16,336 --> 01:22:19,707
Suze, you deviant, answer that.

1186
01:22:21,241 --> 01:22:22,610
(banging continues)

1187
01:22:22,744 --> 01:22:26,079
[Ida] Arthur, you sap,
answer your door.

1188
01:22:27,849 --> 01:22:30,350
(suspenseful theme playing)

1189
01:22:32,085 --> 01:22:34,321
Snobs, sit down.

1190
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:43,230
Don't you go showing off,
for you're the big shot.

1191
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,937
Just give us the number
of that hotsie apartment

1192
01:22:49,069 --> 01:22:51,138
with all the fancy shit in it.

1193
01:22:52,372 --> 01:22:53,775
I don't think you ought to.

1194
01:22:53,908 --> 01:22:55,142
Ought to what?

1195
01:22:55,275 --> 01:22:57,411
Bust your bitch wife
in the nose?

1196
01:22:58,613 --> 01:23:01,148
Ah, it's 10F.

1197
01:23:01,281 --> 01:23:03,450
Get off it already.

1198
01:23:29,443 --> 01:23:32,379
You two, with me upstairs.

1199
01:23:33,681 --> 01:23:35,249
Watch 'em.

1200
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:43,390
(suspenseful theme continues)

1201
01:23:58,006 --> 01:24:01,074
(Dickie vocalizing)

1202
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:12,419
I saw Liz Taylor
at the Bijou 52.

1203
01:24:12,554 --> 01:24:14,689
- She was wearing a fur coat.
- (opens lighter)

1204
01:24:17,959 --> 01:24:19,594
I saw Monty Clift.

1205
01:24:19,727 --> 01:24:22,095
They were on a date.

1206
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:25,499
I watched two boys
wrestling underwater.

1207
01:24:28,302 --> 01:24:30,572
There was a bust with the cops.

1208
01:24:33,307 --> 01:24:35,375
I don't know what kind of
mixed up you are,

1209
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:37,411
but whatever itch
you got to scratch,

1210
01:24:37,545 --> 01:24:40,548
do it on some other guy's ding
some other the night.

1211
01:24:40,682 --> 01:24:42,382
Hey!
Zip it.

1212
01:24:43,685 --> 01:24:47,722
Missus,
take your heinie over here.

1213
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:53,861
Hi, Dickie.

1214
01:24:55,162 --> 01:24:57,331
Hiya, Suze.

1215
01:24:59,099 --> 01:25:00,500
Hiya, poets.

1216
01:25:00,635 --> 01:25:02,135
Psst.

1217
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:04,672
They're gonna be
up there a while,

1218
01:25:04,806 --> 01:25:08,643
lots of stuff,
lots of big, big old,

1219
01:25:08,776 --> 01:25:13,246
heavy high-ticket items.

1220
01:25:14,749 --> 01:25:16,751
We're in no...

1221
01:25:18,653 --> 01:25:20,187
rush.

1222
01:25:25,258 --> 01:25:26,861
Let me go to the restroom.

1223
01:25:26,995 --> 01:25:28,462
No.

1224
01:25:34,969 --> 01:25:36,303
(dry chuckle)

1225
01:25:41,408 --> 01:25:42,877
You'd have done better
if you headed

1226
01:25:43,011 --> 01:25:44,879
to a national park

1227
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,515
and marrying a grizzly.

1228
01:25:47,649 --> 01:25:51,318
There's no way she has
a muffin in her pants.

1229
01:25:51,451 --> 01:25:52,687
(object slices flesh)

1230
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:55,489
(groaning)

1231
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:57,792
(gasps for air)

1232
01:26:08,903 --> 01:26:12,406
Scram!

1233
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:16,176
(woman screaming)

1234
01:26:21,214 --> 01:26:25,520
Aw, shh, Dickie.
Shh.

1235
01:26:27,889 --> 01:26:29,356
You're all right.

1236
01:26:29,489 --> 01:26:32,527
You're a healthy,
well-balanced, young gentleman.

1237
01:26:33,493 --> 01:26:35,328
You're okay.

1238
01:26:42,704 --> 01:26:47,374
He killed that darling
Joanne, didn't he?

1239
01:26:53,514 --> 01:26:55,717
You've been asking for it.

1240
01:26:57,952 --> 01:26:59,187
We'll handle him later.

1241
01:26:59,319 --> 01:27:00,487
Ice it.

1242
01:27:00,621 --> 01:27:02,890
Keep it like a secret.

1243
01:27:03,024 --> 01:27:05,626
Okay, bean?
Hear me?

1244
01:27:11,733 --> 01:27:14,902
(woman screaming in distance)

1245
01:27:44,665 --> 01:27:45,933
Arthur,
