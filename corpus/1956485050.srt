Hey, Poker.

363
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,781
How long have we been waiting
to get our hands on this creep?

364
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,113
A long fucking time, sister.

365
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,790

and squeeze all the cream out of her.

369
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,502

Ding dong, the bitch is dead.

- I need to finish this.
- Finish when I'm finished.

397
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,712
I can't leave an open wound.

398
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,300
I bet you can.

399
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,132
Yes, sir.

400
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,971
Bye.

401
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,101
[Baby] So, now what, huh?

402
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,230
You gonna try and get it on
with me or something?

403
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,937
Oh, you'll find out.

404
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,070
Come on. I know how you
dyke guards are always dreaming about me.

405

Yeah, I've been dreaming
about this for a long time.

Greta.

408
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,876
I thought we were going to be friends.

409
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,637
You just turned out to be
too much of an asshole.

410
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,886
[chuckles] Have fun, bitch.

411
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,021
Look.

412
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:12,485
Let's cut the usual psycho
bullshit you're about to spew

413
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,812
and get down to it.

414
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,400
That must hurt.

415
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,529
You know...

416
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,205
and I know...

417
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:30,666
how miserable I can make your life.

418
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,339
So why don't you just tell me
what I want to know...

419
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,627
and we can call it a day.

420
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,670
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

421
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,305
<i>¿Qué</i>?

422
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,258
Who let you out of solitary?

423
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,722
Hmm.

424
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,852
Who let me out of solitary?

425
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,269
What makes you think I just
didn't walk out on my own?

426
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,696
[both laugh]

427
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,945
Who are you protecting?

428
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,279
One day,

429
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,498
I was out having a stroll...

430
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:12,037
and I saw a little kitty stuck in a hole.

431
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,920
She was struggling to get out.

432
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:20,049
So I reached in to get her,
but she scratched me.

433
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,088
Is there a point to the story?

434
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,341
Hmm.

435
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:30,021
Along comes the big old warden.

436
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,973
[chuckles]

437
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:36,061
He stops and he watches me...

438
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,694
and then he screams,

439
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:44,911
"Stop trying to help that stupid cat.

440
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:49,116
She's gonna get herself out of
there one way or another."

441
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,909
Huh?

442
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,458
But I didn't listen
to that dumb old warden.

443
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:59,839
I kept helping until I got that kitty out.

444
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,344
Are you done?

445
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,340
So what was the point to this story?

446
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,596
[mewing]

447
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,439

[dog barking]

454
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,968
Judy says he barks as soon
as I come down the street.

455
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,224
I don't know whether
he likes me or hates me.

456
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,852
You talked to the owner about it?

457
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,355
I don't even know
what language she speaks.

458
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,237
Judy?

459
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,027
Where is everybody?

460
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,989
What the hell is going on?

461
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,913
Judy?

462
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,755
[whimpering] Help me.

463
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,086
What the hell is this?
Some kind of a sick joke?

464
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,426
This has been a long day. It ain't funny.

[Otis laughs]

466
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,679
I don't know.

467
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,644
Pretty goddamn funny to me.

468
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,317
- Guess who's coming down, bitches?
- [women whimpering]

469

The dynamic-fucking-duo, Batman and Robin.

Chief, we need to jaw,
so I suggest you two sit your asses down.

471
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,655
[Otis] Hi, sweetie. What's your name?

472
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,956
Look, you don't have to do this.

473
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,325
- Please.
- [woman crying]

474
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,420
Or what?

475
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,539
You gonna throw me in the hole
and make me sleep in my own piss and shit?

476
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,090
[man] No,
you could just walk out that door.

477
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:06,419
Keep walking and never look back.

478
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:10,507
Oh, brother, what a sweet little man.

479
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,967
We should let the lovebirds go.

- No!

- Open your mouth!
- No!

483
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,060
Open your mouth. Open your fucking mouth.

484
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,238
- Look, look...
- Practice sucking on that for a while.

485
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,691
[crying]

486
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,904
I'll get around to the real deal later.

487
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:37,959
And remember, I feel any teeth,
it's gonna be a bad day at Black Rock.

488
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,286
Look! Look! Get...

489
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,336
[screaming and crying]

490
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,959
Don't.

491
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,291
Just stop.

492
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,758
You can't fix this.

493
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,256
[Otis] Oh!

494
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,555
You know,
she's not a bad little cocksucker.

495
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,927
She could be better, but don't worry,

496
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,684
I'll teach her.

497
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,975
[man] Let's go.

498
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,440
She's got nothing to do with us.

499
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,940
[all screaming]

500
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,027
Shut the fuck up!

501
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,492
My finger slipped.

502
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,116
Jesus Christ! He fucking shot me.

503
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,744
[mockingly] "Jesus Christ,
he fucking shot me."

504
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,200
- What is happening?
- Let me go over and help him, please.

505
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,294
[Otis] Sit down.

506
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:21,915
Sit down.

507
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:29,923
[Otis laughs]

508

[Baby humming]

509
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,098
I heard you kept your mouth shut.

510
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,101
That's good.

511
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,811
I trained you well.

512
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,399
Remember, snitches get stitches.

513
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:52,075
Oh, but I see
you already got your stitches.

514
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,122
"Snitches get stitches."

515
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,533
That's cute.

516
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,044
You think I don't know what you do?

517
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:15,507
Every night you fold me up
and put me into your pocket.

518
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,103
You take me home.

519
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,314
I watch you...

520
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,772
sitting all alone,

521
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:31,322
getting all wet just thinking of me.

522
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,740
[chuckles]

523
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,028
I live inside your head.

524
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,081
I live inside your head.

525
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,170
I do, I live in your head.

526
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,918
[slurping]

527
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,385
You can't trick me, you bitch.

are having a Halloween party

950
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:07,098

wondering if you'd like to join us?

951

How about this?

952

Ditch those losers and come with me.

We'll have so much fun.

959

[Winslow] I ain't looking
to rain on this reunion parade...

960
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,409

Uh, I have no idea.

962
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:38,750
Truthfully, I never thought
we'd make it this far.

963
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,924
I was thinking maybe
we get into the movies.

964
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,631
Huh.

965
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:49,014
Movies? Yeah, that's a new one.

966

That's where the money's at

967
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,817
'cause people love watching
other people fucking.

968

- So, our first movie, right?

970

This guy goes around
house to house selling salami.

ding-dong, opens it up.

Every one of them,
"Show me your salami, motherfucker."

- Right.

dog's in there...

Right? No fucking the dog,
but we bring the dog in.

981
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,264
Why not?

982
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:37,771
- I'm not into dog fucking.
- Maybe in the sequel.

983

990
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:58,705

a Halloween party?

What flavor?

998

the most buzz.

01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:23,393
[sniffs] Mmm.

1063
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,517
Goddamn, this girl needs a shower.

1064
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,140
Smell me.

1065
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:31,568
- No, no.
- Party pooper.

1066
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:32,654
[laughing]

1067
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,856
- [Otis] Okay.
- [Baby] Party pooper.

1068
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:37,532
[Winslow]
There's some kind of hotel down there.

1069
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:40,032
I guess we could hole up there
for a couple of days.

1070
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,282
Let's do it.

1071
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,864
- [howling]
- [Otis] Yeah. [howling]

1072
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:47,997
Come on, is that your best shot?

1073
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,329
[vocalizing]

1074
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:53,590
[laughs]

1075
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,759
Oh, fuck, man.

1076
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:53,944
You run this joint?

1077
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:57,151
Run this joint? I own this joint.

1078
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,856
I am Carlos.

1079
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:00,066
I'm king of Durango.

1080
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:03,027
I am a councilman, alderman,
fireman, policeman,

1081
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:06,080
and sometimes, when necessary,
I am the undertaker.

1082
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,665
Who died and made you king of Mexico?

1083
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:09,958
Huh?

1084
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,285
What do you mean by that?

1085
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,292
Hey, can we get down to business?

1086
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:15,748
Yeah, we need a room.

1087
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:17,629
Ah, well, you have come
to the right place.

1088
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:19,905
I got the best motherfucking room
in all Durango for you.

1089
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,136
Sebastian.

1090
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,589
Sebastian.

1091
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:27,302
Get your lazy ass out here
and help the lady with her bag.

1092
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:29,724
Man, don't...

1093
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:32,522
- Do I pay you to sleep?
- Carlos, I was painting.

1094
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,602
[Carlos] Painting, no wonder
our establishment is in the toilet.

1095
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:38,312
[laughs] Help the lady.

1096
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,075
Yeah, don't worry about him.

1097
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:46,825
I know he looks like a monster
but he's gentle as a baby rattlesnake.

1098
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:50,328
Yeah, well, there's one thing
I ain't afraid of, it's monsters.

1099
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:51,750
[Sebastian] <i>Señorita.</i>

1100
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,207
- The bow and arrow?
- Yeah.

1101
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:56,914
- Okay.
- All right now, follow me.

1102
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:58,965
Presidential suite awaits.

1103
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:04,672
And, well, here it is, Durango's finest.

1104
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:06,598
Everything you'll need is right here.

1105
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:09,927
There is your entertainment center,
there is your library

1106
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:11,603
and your very own commode.

1107
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:14,557
- Commode?
- That's right. Your very own.

1108
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:19,316
I take it pissing in the streets is the
only excitement you have around here.

1109
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:20,612
Huh?

1110
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:23,987
Ramon, what the hell
are you doing down there?

1111
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,534
Take it to the alley.

1112
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,111
Beautiful.

1113
01:09:27,205 --> 01:09:29,413
Anyway, I'll let you guys settle in,

1114
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:32,537
and once you're done settling in,
why don't you come down to the saloon,

1115
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:36,337
Lobo Blanco,
I will hook you motherfuckers up.

1116
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:39,381
And you, I know you like the ladies.

1117
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:41,003
Yeah, depends on the ladies.

1118
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,302
Well, if you like them
with the big ol' sloppy jugs

1119
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:46,005
and the big ol' swampy ass,
then I got three for you.

1120
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:49,342
Bella, Princesa and Juanita.

1121
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:52,303
[chuckles] Names aren't that important.

1122
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:54,263
Well, enough of my yakking.

1123
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,473
Come on, Sebastian.

1124
01:09:58,528 --> 01:09:59,860
[door shuts]

1125
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,612
[Winslow] What do you think?

1126
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,691
Any one of them recognize us?

1127
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:06,195
[Baby] Those creeps?

1128
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:09,323
Nah, they didn't recognize shit.

1129
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:13,331
Man, Mexico sucks.

1130
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,222
- [phone ringing]
- [drilling]

1131
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,415
Yeah.

1132
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:57,539
Aquarius, I got something
I know you're gonna wanna know all about.

1133
01:10:57,879 --> 01:10:58,879
Who is this?

1134
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:00,830
This is Carlos.

1135
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,880
I know a lot of motherfuckers
named Carlos.

1136
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,647
Well, this is
the motherfucker named Carlos

1137
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,215
that hooked you up
with 15 kilos of pure snow.

1138
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:09,843
And you got paid. What do you want?

1139
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:13,346
Well, how about a pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow?

1140
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:15,143
How about you go fuck yourself?

1141
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:17,937
Hey, hey, brother, brother, hold on.

1142
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:21,108
'Cause I got something
that you've been looking high and low for.

1143
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:23,945
I'm listening.

1144
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,862
<i>Those fuckers that killed your daddy,</i>

1145
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:29,407
<i>theyjust rolled into town
without a motherfucking care in the world.</i>

1146
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,360
And I know exactly where they are,

1147
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:34,492
and I know exactly how to keep them
safe and sound till you get here.

1148
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:38,034
What exactly is it gonna take
to keep them safe?

1149
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:42,167
I need enough dough to get my ass out of
Mexico permanently, so how about...

1150
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,997
[mumbling]

1151
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:45,252
$10,000 American.

1152
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:46,593
Done.

1153
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:49,010
That was easy, how about 20,000?

1154
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,305
Don't fuck with me.

1155
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:53,723
Oh, I'm not fucking with you,
so 10,000 it is.

1156
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,143
- One more thing.
<i>- Yeah, what's that?</i>

1157
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:58,307
Have three coffins waiting.

1158
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,723
You got that, no problem.

1159
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:11,362
Revenge is coming, Papa.

1160
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,528
Revenge is coming.

1161
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,371
- [fireworks popping]
- [music playing]

1162
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,428
[Baby whispers] Otis.

1163
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:45,944
Otis.

1164
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:50,606
Otis.

1165
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,204
Yeah?

1166
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,782
You ever think maybe it's not worth it?

1167
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,412
What?

1168
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:03,376
I don't know, anything.

1169
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:08,791
Thinking about Cutter?

1170
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:10,969
Yeah.

1171
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:15,672
[Otis] <i>The old bastard
had a pretty good run.</i>

1172
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:19,430
<i>Did more living than most fuckers.</i>

1173
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:24,769
Besides, we all get fucked in the end.

1174
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:29,898
I mean, what else is there?

1175
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:34,866
Nothing, I guess.

1176
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,861
It's just weird.

1177
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:39,663
[Otis] What?

1178
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:44,501
Everybody's gone. It's just the two of us.

1179
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:47,580
Yeah, that's the past.

1180
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:50,086
[Winslow]
Hey, I'm here and down for anything.

1181
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,633
I mean, the two of us?

1182
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,336
That's the future.

1183
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:58,344
Come on, man, shit, what am I,
fucking invisible or what?

1184
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:00,843
The three of us.

1185
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,520
Yeah.

1186
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,767
I mean, we can still do
a lot of destruction

1187
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:06,814
in this fucked up, crazy world.

1188
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:08,610
You think?

1189
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:10,398
Fuck, yeah.

1190
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:12,150
Goddamn right.

1191
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:15,107
Well, okay.

1192
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:17,826
[groans]

1193
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:19,737
[sighs]

1194
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:22,576
Let's go get fucked up.

1195
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:24,704
And do some fucked up shit?

1196
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:27,332
[laughs] Sis, what other kind is there?

1197
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,747
[howling]

1198
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,923
[all laughing]

1199
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:35,961
[rock music playing]

1200
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,691
[Carlos] Friends, how are you?

1201
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,446
Come on in, join the party.

1202
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,244
I see that the glamour
of my fine establishment

1203
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,662
has pulled you right in.

1204
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:46,957
- Hey, where's the drinks?
- [Otis] Tequila.

1205
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:50,002
[Carlos] First one's on the house,
then you pay for the rest.

1206
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:53,125
Carlos here gotta make a living.

1207
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,799
- All right, to Mexico.
- Mexico.

1208
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,552
[Carlos] All right.

1209
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:02,802
Princesa, Juanita, <i>ven acá, pronto.</i>

1210
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,349
<i>Hola,</i> baby.

1211
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:07,098
Baby, come on in.

1212
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,099
I'm happy.

1213
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:12,274
You're not a lady that happens
to like the ladies, are you?

1214
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:14,601
We'll see how the evening goes.

1215
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,357
You don't like me, <i>mami?</i>

1216
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:19,190
You're all right, kid,
but I wanna know what's going on outside.

1217
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:20,740
[grunts]

1218
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:23,614
Oh, them? The gentlemen of this town

1219
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:26,242
are having their annual
knife throwing contest.

1220
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:29,291
They like to show off their machismo.

1221
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:32,540
Mmm, I'm gonna get in on that
and show them some of mine.

1222
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:34,166
Well, you go ahead.

1223
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:35,588
Yo, give me the knife.

1224
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:39,376
[gasps]

1225
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:46,217
Come here. You look just fine to me,
my little hot taco.

1226
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,347
- Yeah.
- No, I no work with her.

1227
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,645
- Well, fuck you.
- You like her?

1228
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,063
Yes, she's nice.

1229
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,890
Well, problem solved.

1230
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:57,944
You can ride all night with us
until your dick falls off.

1231
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,030
[all laugh]

1232
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:00,651
Well, that's what I'm afraid of.

1233
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:03,616
I'll take that, motherfucker.

1234
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:06,490
And you're gonna pay for that, too,
motherfucker.

1235

- [grunts]
- [cheering]

1236
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:20,292
[laughing]

1237
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:24,304
This <i>gringa</i> bitch thinks it's funny.

1238
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:26,764
How about we cut you?

1239
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:28,342
Not much laughing then, huh?

1240
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:31,143
Now, hold on, gentlemen.
Hold on, just calm down.

1241
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,722
Little lady wants to play.

1242
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:35,478
What are we working with?

1243
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:37,643
This much.

1244
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:40,820
Gentlemen, put up or shut up.

1245
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:44,487
Okay, I can work with that.

1246
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:46,530
Me too.

1247
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,078
I'll hold these for safekeeping.

1248
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:52,749
Keep the game on the up and up,
no hanky-panky double-dealing here.

1249
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:54,201
I run a clean game.

1250
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:56,287
I go first, I am best.

1251
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:09,433
That way Goldilocks can see that
Diego is master of the blade.

- [grunts]
- [cheering]

1253
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,148
[Carlos chuckling] Well, now...

1254
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:24,569
I should call that
seven-and-a-quarter inches.

1255
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:27,150
That's pretty good if you're measuring
your ding-a-ling.

1256
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:29,361
[laughing]

1257
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:32,869
There's too much noise. Too much noise.

1258
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:36,998
Step aside.
Let me show you how to kill the demon.

1259
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:39,621
Watch and learn.

1260
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:46,510
Whoo-y, now.

1261
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:52,426
That one cold went two inches.
That's gonna be a tough one to beat.

1262
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:55,011
I think you have wasted your money.

1263
01:18:55,898 --> 01:19:00,063
Maybe you'll pay me another way, huh?

1264
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:03,441
Show me your real Goldilocks.

1265
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,112
[Carlos] Hold there, come on,

1266
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:08,067
don't be counting your peckers
before they hatch there.

1267
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,026
Little lady's gotta give it a go.

1268
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:13,663
Such a big knife.

1269
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:16,999
What? You think I can't handle this?

1270
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,328
I've got something for you to handle.

1271
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,538
[laughing]

1272
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:24,340
You better be careful,
I might miss and cut it off.

1273
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,965
Enough talk. Throw.

1274
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:30,421
Don't forget the tequila.

1275
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,257
Rules are the rules.

1276
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:37,141
Look, she's afraid to drink. [laughs]

1277
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:46,404
It's called a dramatic pause.

1278
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,777
Helps to create a little suspense.

1279
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:52,698
You never know what might happen.

1280
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,113
Will I miss?

1281
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:57,665
Or will I...

1282
01:19:58,335 --> 01:19:59,871
[grunts]

1283
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:01,749
[cheering]

1284
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:03,250
Goddamn!

1285
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:04,626
How about a missionary?

1286
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:06,549
Pay up, suckers!

1287
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:10,720
Here you go, here you go, here you go.

1288
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,131
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1289
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:14,591
Hey, all righty.

1290

[Winslow] That's it.

1298
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:11,125
Oh, yeah.

1299
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:14,962
[chuckles] Bella, Bella, Bella.

1300
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:17,927
Where have you been all my life?

1301
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,882
[exclaims]

1302
01:22:19,977 --> 01:22:21,058
Boy.

1303
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:23,807
Right here, <i>papi.</i>

1304
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:27,186
Waiting for you to take me away from here.

1305
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:32,067
Well, ass cakes, the wait is over.

1306
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:33,567
[sighs] <i>Sí.</i>

1307
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:36,570
I'm gonna whip you away
from this little shithole...

1308
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:39,986
and put you into the movies.

1309
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:41,745
[chuckles]

1310
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:43,744
- Yeah.
- You're gonna take me to Hollywood?

1311
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:45,245
Uh-huh.

1312
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:48,040
Something like that, yeah.

1313
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:50,588
[knocking on door]

1314
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:57,428
[Baby] Fuck.

1315
01:22:58,390 --> 01:22:59,631
Hold on.

1316
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:23,367
Hi, I bring breakfast. May I come in?

1317
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:26,620
Right on. Yeah, I'm starving.

1318
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,076
- Come on in.
- All right.

1319
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:31,504
These are <i>arroz con frijoles.</i>

1320
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:32,706
What's that?

1321
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:34,711
[Sebastian] Rice and beans.

1322
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:36,918
Drop on table, man.

1323
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,299
No, hey, man, have a seat.

1324
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:41,676
- I'm sick of eating alone.
- Okay.

1325
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:48,054
Besides, I don't know
where my fucking brothers are at.

1326
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:52,396
They were just with
the town bicycle <i>chicas.</i>

1327
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:53,861
Huh?

1328
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:58,236
The bicycle girls,
everyone in town has had a ride.

1329
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:00,366
Nah, I joke.

1330
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,239
- [both laugh]
- That's funny.

1331
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:03,945
That's good.

1332
01:24:04,081 --> 01:24:08,291
There's gonna be some weird looking babies
popping out in nine months then.

1333
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:09,868
Yeah, maybe with two heads.

Thank you<i>. Gracias.</i>

1337
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:23,214
You know...

1338
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:27,636
you kind of remind me of my brother Tiny.

1339
01:24:28,647 --> 01:24:31,856
- Tiny.
- I mean, he was really huge

1340
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:34,184
and you're pretty small,

1341
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:38,147
but you guys have the same vibe.

1342
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:42,784
No, no, no, I'm horrible.

1343
01:24:42,869 --> 01:24:45,202
He was horrible too.

1344
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:51,122
I thought he was beautiful
in this weird kind of way though.

1345
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:58,166
My daddy always said,

1346
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:01,719
"Anything one of a kind
is pretty special."

1347
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:05,424
Well, your papa is a very wise man.

1348
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:09,014
And he... I bet he was very, very handsome

1349
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:12,222
to have such
a beautiful, beautiful daughter.

1350
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,225
Yeah, I guess so.

1359
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:03,110
Ah!

1360
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:10,242
Is this what you eat for breakfast here?

1361
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:13,200
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

1362
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:14,293
[laughs]

1363
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:15,914
- I can dig.
- That's good.

1364
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:19,501
- [coughs]
- [laughs]

1365
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:22,959
Okay, this is enough for me.
I'm starting to feel funny.

1366
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,296
- That just means it's working.
- Okay.

1367
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,756
[both laugh]

1368
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:41,482
[Winslow] That's it. Leave it on that one.

1369
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:43,897
I love this movie.

1370
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:49,073
What is this? I don't like it.

1371
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:53,702
That's Lon Chaney as Quasimodo, baby.
It don't get any better than that.

1372
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:56,580
Although Charles Laughton
was pretty fucking great too.

1373
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,704
But he's so ugly.

1374
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:06,006
"I never realized till now...

1375
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:09,922
how ugly I am...

1376
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:15,144
and that's because you're so beautiful."

[laughs]

1378
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:23,812

Oh, my God, she does look like you.
He's eating her pussy.

1381
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,498
Look at that. He's loving it.
It's a cactus!

That's weird.

It's so trippy, man. What's going on?

[Baby] Why? Who are they?

1394

They call themselves the Black Satans.
They're killers.

If they're here, it's a very,
very bad day for someone.

Fuck them. Why's that fucker
pointing up here at me?

I... I think they're here to kill you.

Fuck, man. I gotta warn Otis.

No, no, no. You hide. I tell him.

01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:40,056
He says Satan is coming to kill you.

1409
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,597
How can Satan kill me? I am fucking Satan!

1410
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:43,927
[woman] You have to hide, <i>papi.</i>

[screams]

1414

Who the fuck do you think you are,
kicking in my fucking door?

1418
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:58,373
Hey, asshole, I'm talking to you.

1419
01:33:59,259 --> 01:34:00,420
Yeah, you.

1420
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:02,881
Oh.

1421
01:34:03,513 --> 01:34:04,845
You want some of this?

1422
01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:09,217
I'm sorry, you're too late.

1423
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,351
I have a boyfriend now.

1425
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:15,147
Who?

1426
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:18,772
<i>Mira, cabrona,</i>
you tired-ass, filthy fucking <i>puta.</i>

1427
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:21,692
You better think about it a little harder.

1428
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:22,862
[claps]

1429
01:34:23,825 --> 01:34:26,533
Wait a second, I know that voice.

1430
01:34:27,412 --> 01:34:31,907
Francisco Mendoza Chavez.

1431
01:34:34,586 --> 01:34:35,793
You got me.

1432
01:34:39,757 --> 01:34:40,838

<i>You don't scare me.</i>

1434
01:34:44,012 --> 01:34:45,799
Get the fuck out of here.

1435
01:35:00,987 --> 01:35:02,774
How many bullets do you have left?

1436
01:35:02,864 --> 01:35:04,696
[panting]

1437
01:35:04,782 --> 01:35:07,115
<i>- Uno.</i>
- Fuck.

1438
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:08,283
Make it count.

1439
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:10,786
Make it the magic bullet.

1440
01:35:10,872 --> 01:35:14,912
Hey, you have three seconds,
then we kill you.

1441

What took you so long, motherfucker?

1448
01:35:50,203 --> 01:35:53,162
Cavalry comes when it comes, big brother.

1449
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:57,374
What the fuck!

1450
01:36:01,714 --> 01:36:04,206
Next time, make sure
they're all the way dead.

1451
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:11,130
Where the fuck's the lollipop kid going?

1452
01:36:11,975 --> 01:36:13,136
Back to Oz.

1454
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:20,807
Look at this skull fucker.

1455
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:24,852
Still clinging
to his worthless little life.

1456
01:36:24,946 --> 01:36:26,278
Time's up.

[grunting]

1458
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:36,701
Fuck you!

1459
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:50,506

[yells]

1462
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,403
Should be down this way.

1463
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:18,997
Just don't shoot me in the ass, man.

1464
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:21,245
This time, get out of my fucking way then.

1465
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:22,543
Okay, motherfucker.

<i>Hola, muchacho.</i> I suggest
you drop that boom-boom stick

1469
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:56,868
- Fuck me.
- You got that right.

1470
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:18,181
Going somewhere, motherfucker?

1471
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:21,977
Yeah, matter of fact, I was thinking of
going on a little vacation.

1472
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:24,350
- Well, think again.
- No, man, you think again!

1473
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:25,647
You can't beat this.

1474
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,851
Once the Black Satans arrive,
man, it's already over.

1475
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:30,937
Man, you're messing with the wrong dudes.

1476

Man, you brought this down
on yourself and everybody else.

Man, I'm just the middle man stuck in
the middle of the middle of the middle!

1478
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:37,693
The rat sure can squeak.

1479
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:39,153
Squeak me a story, rat.

1480
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:42,615
Man, I'm telling you, man,
you should just go and die easy.

1481
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:45,576
You can't beat them.
Now get this through your thick skull.

1482
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:48,003
It's over. It's over, man. You can't win.

1483
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:51,582
Maybe not,
but I got something to tell you, rat.

1484
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:54,259
- What?
- You sure can fucking lose.

Whoa, hold on, man. Just hold on.

01:38:57,056 --> 01:38:59,719
I'm just a guy trying to survive
from hustle to hustle, man.

01:38:59,809 --> 01:39:02,597
I got nothing against you.
I got nothing against nobody.

- Go on.

How about this? We...
We split the money, 50-50?

I've heard a lot about you.

But now that I see you...

1498
01:40:00,161 --> 01:40:01,493
I know it's all bullshit.

1499
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:04,279

You're not even worth a bullet.

01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:05,224
[Aquarius] I think your brother
has left you to rot.

1513
01:41:06,811 --> 01:41:08,177
I'm not surprised.

Look at that.

The last member
of our funeral party has arrived.

You should have stayed in prison.

1526
01:41:54,942 --> 01:41:57,309
Being a free man has been
hazardous to your health.

1527
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:02,819
At this point,
life seems hazardous to my health.

1528
01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:05,571
Yes, but that problem will soon be solved.

1529
01:42:06,579 --> 01:42:09,538
Let her go.
She's got nothing to do with this shit.

- Yes, I do!
- Shut the fuck up, Baby.

every fucker here with my bare hands.

Fuck!

- It's all me.
- [Aquarius] True.

1535
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:27,298
But you, above anyone else,
should understand that family is family.

1536
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:30,304
So she'll pay for your sins,
just as hard as you do.

1537
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:33,470
But since I'm a nice guy...

1538
01:42:35,107 --> 01:42:37,520
I'm gonna let you pick who dies first.

1539
01:42:43,449 --> 01:42:44,485

1544
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:55,200
How about you and me?

1545
01:42:56,837 --> 01:42:58,044
No guns.

1546
01:43:00,383 --> 01:43:01,715
Just two machetes.

1547
01:43:03,135 --> 01:43:04,717
[Aquarius] Makes no difference to me.

1548
01:43:05,304 --> 01:43:06,511
Drop your weapon.

1549

See if you got what it takes
to keep blondie alive.

1550

What do you think, Foxy?

1551
01:43:12,812 --> 01:43:14,474
I think we're fucked, man.

1552
01:43:15,147 --> 01:43:16,809
No way! Fucking kill him!

1553
01:43:17,525 --> 01:43:20,814
Kill him! Kill him! Kill them all!

1554
01:43:24,073 --> 01:43:25,530
What's it gonna be?

1555
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:29,359
You see, without a gun...

1556
01:43:31,914 --> 01:43:33,325
he's nothing.

No fucking rules.

[laughs tauntingly]

1566
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:18,583
Is that your blood already? Yeah.

Come on, Otis!

[Baby] Nice!

Fuck, no! Where is she?

Sanctuary!

1580
01:45:40,918 --> 01:45:42,534
Sanctuary!

1581
01:45:42,628 --> 01:45:44,494

01:46:23,919 --> 01:46:25,251
Nice gun.

1584
01:46:25,337 --> 01:46:26,373
[laughs]

1585
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:27,999
I'll take that.

1586
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:32,133
So you got me. Now what?

1587
01:46:32,845 --> 01:46:35,303
Now I guess she'll just slit
your fucking throat.

1588
01:46:36,599 --> 01:46:38,465
I got a better idea.

1589
01:46:43,022 --> 01:46:44,513
What are you waiting for?

1590
01:46:45,441 --> 01:46:46,557
Nothing.

1591
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:51,061
Waiting for him to break.

1592
01:46:52,448 --> 01:46:55,282
Something in the eyes snaps.

1593
01:46:58,454 --> 01:47:01,572
- Was that it?
- No. Keep watching.

1594
01:47:04,835 --> 01:47:07,623
He looks pretty goddamn broken to me.

1595
01:47:12,551 --> 01:47:15,965
- I'm betting that was it.
- [chuckles] That was it.

1596
01:47:19,308 --> 01:47:22,927
Make sure he's covered.
I want him good and crispy.

1597
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:26,013
I know how to cook a fucking corpse.

1598
01:47:26,649 --> 01:47:27,981
Any last words?

1599
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:30,229
Yeah.

1600
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:33,020
Fuck you.

1601
01:47:33,948 --> 01:47:35,780
Fuck you!

1602
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:37,277
They always say that.

1603
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:38,734
[Aquarius] Fuck you!

1604
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:42,954
<i>Adiós,</i> motherfucker!

1605
01:47:46,794 --> 01:47:49,002
- [yelling]
- [laughing]

1606
01:47:55,427 --> 01:47:56,427
Don't, man.

1607
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:14,186
[screaming]

1608
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:27,415
[laughing]

1609
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:30,084
[screaming in Spanish]

1610
01:48:42,099 --> 01:48:43,385
[screaming dies down]

1611
01:48:57,823 --> 01:49:00,281
[upbeat music playing]

1612
01:53:26,508 --> 01:53:28,625
[dramatic music playing]
