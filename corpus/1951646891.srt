<i>Together</i>

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,276
<i>Is so precious</i>

4
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,440
<i>Together</i>

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,416
<i>We have grown</i>

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,456
<i>We have grown</i>

7
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,960
<i>Although our love</i>

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,053
<i>Is still special</i>

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:38,801
<i>Let's take a chance
and fly away</i>

10
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,807
<i>Somewhere</i>

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,810
<i>Alone</i>

12
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,312
<i>It's been too long
since we took the time</i>

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,146
<i>No one's to blame,
My, the time flies so quickly</i>

14
00:00:55,255 --> 00:01:00,090
<i>But when
I see you, darling</i>

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,062
<i>It's like we both
are falling</i>

16
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,428
<i>In love again</i>

17
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:11,436
<i>It'll be just
like starting over</i>

18
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,438
<i>Over</i>

19
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,703
<i>Starting over</i>

20
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,539
<i>Over</i>

21
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,102
<i>Every day we
used to make love</i>

22
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:25,117
<i>Why can't we be
making love nice and easy?</i>

23
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:33,959
<i>It's time to spread
our wings and fly</i>

24
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:39,966
<i>Don't let another day
go by, my love</i>

25
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:45,164
<i>It’ll be just
like starting over</i>

26
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,763
<i>Over and
over and over</i>

27
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,867
<i>Why don't we
take off alone?</i>

28
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,968
<i>La de da</i>

29
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,478

30
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:57,983

Alan, Alan.

33
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:04,890
Hey, what's up, Dad?

34
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,890
Uh, you're boarding
in a few minutes.

35
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,857
I'm gonna go
find your mother.

36
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:07,950
Dad, relax.

37
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,392
She just doesn't want us
to see her crying.

38
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,895
So she went
to the bathroom

39
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,295
to cry in front of
strangers, of course.

40
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,559
How about you, Dad?

41
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,464
You sad to see me
finally leave home?

42
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:16,900
Look, Alan,
you're going abroad

43
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,232
for the first time.

44
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,396
You're gonna be
in a foreign country.

45
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,804
You might even, you
know, go to Amsterdam.

46
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,206
And, you know,
just... just...

47
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,868
European women
are different.

48
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,104
How do you know?

49
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,669
James Bond films, mostly,
but still, that doesn't...

50
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,544
Guys, look at Mommy!

51
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,914
Oh, that
was so cute.

52
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,917
Hi, honey.

53
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:33,918
Hi.

54
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,919
Dad here
was starting

55
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:35,920
to get worried
about you.

56
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,422
Oh, Daddy should
worry about himself.

57
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,082
He can't admit how much
he's gonna miss you.

58
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,922
See, that's the difference
between us.

59
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,586
I get it out
and I let it go,

60
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,095
and he gets a headache.

61
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,426
Well, maybe I wouldn't
get a headache

62
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,931
if you didn't get it out
and let it go.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,365
No, you get a headache

64
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,492
because you don't
express your feelings,

65
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,866
and that's why you
grind your teeth at night.

66
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,598
- Well, maybe if...
- Guys,

67
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,798
can we not have
this moment?

68
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,067
Oh, ok, sorry.

69
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,574
Could you take
that, sweetie?

70
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:57,940
Look, I've got
something for you.

71
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,036
It is an international
beeper.

72
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,274
And all you have to do
is press that little button,

73
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,781
and anywhere you
are on the planet,

74
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,647
it will ring on
my corresponding unit.

75
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,447
- And then what?
- And then I'll call you.

76
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,885
And if you don't answer,
she'll fly over.

77
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,423
P. A: Charter flight 178
to London

78
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,016
is now boarding
at gate 50-b.

79
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,857
All Ohio State students should have
their boarding cards ready.

80
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,693
So, I guess
this is it.

81
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,890
Give your mother
a big hug.

82
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,993
She's very
fragile today.

83
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,305
I think Daddy's
a wreck, ok,

84
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,740
so make sure
you call him, ok?

85
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,673
Ok...

86
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:36,442
you guys take care
of each other.

87
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,414
I was really proud
of you back there.

88
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,084
I thought you
were gonna lose it.

89
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,082
Yeah, so was I. I guess
I'm stronger than I think.

90
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,881
And, look
at it this way,

91
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,387
we have more time
to ourselves now.

92
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,084
Just us.
Just you and me,

93
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,456
alone in the house.

94
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,763
It's ok, it's ok.

95
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,131
I'm sorry.

96
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,635
You know,
you should be

97
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,136
excited about
this interview.

98
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,638
If it goes well, we're
moving to New York.

99
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,730
We'll have more money,

100
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:35,899
and we'll have
that "New York" money.

101
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,909
I don't want any more
money, Henry.

102
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,411
You've been at
Sellinski for 23 years.

103
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,414
You have a good job,

104
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,280
and we've lived
in Ohio all our lives.

105
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,148
Besides, I thought
you hated New York.

106
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,312
I only hated New York

107
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:49,411
when it was hip
to hate New York.

108
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,513
Now it's not hip
to hate it anymore,

109
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,852
so I don't hate it.

110
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,016
I'm in advertising.

111
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,491
I'm weak, and
I follow the crowd.

112
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,326
Well, I guess we
could see Susan more.

113
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:00,331
Maybe you can.
She won't speak to me.

114
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,128
Well, yeah, I mean,
you know, when she calls up

115
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,793
and says she's having second
thoughts about med school

116
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,303
and you blow up at her,
I mean, it's like...

117
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,963
I didn't blow up at her.

118
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,371
- Yes, you did, Henry.
- I did not. I merely told her

119
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,137
that I was
going to sue her.

120
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,236
Oh, you can't sue your own
daughter for lost tuition.

121
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:16,247
You can now. You can.
No, there's that precedent.

122
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,146
It's Mr. Brown vs.
Muffy the daughter.

123
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,149
Oh, my God!

124
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:59,386
Yeah, hang on.
Hang on one second.

125
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,693
Yeah, Tony,
yeah, thanks.

126
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,289
Thanks for setting up
that meeting.

127
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,891
I'm going, 10:00.

128
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,871
Tony, I can't tell Nancy
I was fired.

129
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,202
I know.

130
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,367
I know, it's
very caveman of me,

131
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,707
but that's what
I've decided...

132
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,542
Yeah, well,
you're not Nancy.

133
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,208
Ok, but listen,
I appreciate it.

134
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,046
Ok, thanks, bye.

135
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:44,133
There's too much food.

136
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,904
No, there's not.

137
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,907
I could never get enough
to eat when Alan was here.

138
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,239
Now, pass me those
potatoes, baby.

139
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,904
This is fantastic. We
never get a chance to talk.

140
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,676
When the kids were here,
we only talked about them.

141
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,410
Now we get
to talk about us.

142
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,918
I mean,
this is a gab-fest.

143
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,319
Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak.

144
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,651
So...

145
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,687
uh...

146
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:12,488
what's going on
with you?

147
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,625
I have absolutely
no idea

148
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,568
what I'm going to do
with the rest of my life.

149
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,071
I can't even decide

150
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,970
whether I should go
to New York with you

151
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,475
for that interview.
I'd just be tagging along

152
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:27,774
out of pure panic
and insecurity.

153
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,678
You know, but it's ironic

154
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,410
that the minute
we have time together

155
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,942
that we, like,
immediately separate.

156
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,387
Although, if we force
ourselves to be together

157
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:40,391
instead of letting it
happen naturally,

158
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,950
what are we proving?

159
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,554
Well,

160
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,566
I don't know what
to tell you, baby.

161
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,408
I gotta pack.

162
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:03,842
Good morning, sir.

163
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:04,848
How are you?

164
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:05,975
I'm fine, thank you.

are securely fastened,

00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,071
Are you
excited I came?

180
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,308
What?

181
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,816
Are you
excited I came?

182
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,614
I'm very excited.

183
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:20,423
'Cause you don't
sound excited, Henry.

184
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,257
I'm holding it in.

185
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,229
He's excited.
We're all excited, ok?

186
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:28,858
Oh, Henry, you forgot
your foot chums.

187
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:30,162
What?

188
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,635
Your foot chums.

189
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:32,932
Aah!

190
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,870
Here, could you pass
these down, please,

191
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,567
over there to that man?

192
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,940
No, that's...

193
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,376
Oh, and he
always forgets this.

194
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,435
For the whole trip,

195
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,708
he'll be complaining
about his rash.

196
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,646
Could you
pass that down?

197
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,683
For the next 2 days,

198
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,775
it's gonna be scratch,
scratch, scratch,

199
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,752
flake, flake, flake.

200
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:49,879
Uhh!

201
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:52,389
Man: Let them
sit together.

202
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,925
Thanks.

203
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,585
Here we go.

204
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:56,889
Oh, uh, sorry. We're
not gonna be eating.

205
00:09:56,962 --> 00:09:57,986
Ok.

206
00:09:58,063 --> 00:09:59,052
Don't you think

207
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,189
we should have
a little something, Henry?

208
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,324
Baby, we're
gonna be eating

209
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,765
in one of the great
hotels in the world.

210
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:03,893
You don't want to ruin that

211
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:07,132
with a moldy leftover
ham and cheese sandwich.

212
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,400
He's sorry.

213
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,463
That's ok.

214
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,804
Besides, I'm
too nervous to eat.

215
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,140
Why are you nervous?
It's only an interview.

216
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,804
It's not like you
don't have a job.

217
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,904
Well, this is different.

218
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:17,915
It's Senior
Creative Director.

219
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,213
It's the big time.

220
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,481
It'll be all right,
honey.

221
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,250
Great city, isn't it?

222
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,918
All I see is fog.

223
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:30,928
Pilot: Well, folks,
bad news this afternoon.

224
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:32,930
New York is
completely fogged in.

225
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:36,229
We've been diverted to
Logan Airport in Boston.

226
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,293
- Boston?
- Boston?

227
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,699
We're here.

228
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,330
I'll see if there's any flights
going anywhere near New York.

229
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,840
All right,
and I'll get the bags.

230
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:43,932
I'll meet you
at the carousel.

231
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,442
Ok.

232
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,739
Henry?

233
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:52,575
Yes, I'm still
excited you came.

234
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,547
Bags.

235
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,355
Ooh!

236
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,897
The buses are filled
until 3:00 in the morning.

237
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,728
The next train to New York
from South Station

238
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,563
is in 20 minutes.

239
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,204
[Whistling]

240
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,913
There's a train
in 20 minutes,

241
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,042
gets us into New York...

242
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,050
Where... Where
are the bags?

243
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,051
They didn't come out.

244
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,678
What do you mean
they didn't come out?

245
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,188
I can't say it any simpler
than that, Henry.

246
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,747
They didn't come out.

247
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,019
What do you mean
they didn't come out?

248
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,287
Calm down, Henry.

249
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,385
How can I calm down?

250
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,429
I've got to be in
New York tomorrow morning

251
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:38,758
for the most important
interview of my...

252
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,423
just give me the claim...
the check... give me...

253
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,523
Henry!

254
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,532
Excuse me!

255
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,533
Excuse me!

256
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,933
Are there any more
bags up there?

257
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,096
We were supposed
to land...

258
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:47,263
Are you crazy?

259
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,931
Listen, I'm Henry Clark
from flight 42.

260
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,976
It's 3-6-4...

261
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,237
You're gonna
get hurt!

262
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,302
6-T-dash-7... Ohh!

263
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:59,940
That's not our bag!

264
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,884
Can you describe
the bags?

265
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,387
Yes, I have
a brown suitcase,

266
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
a brown garment bag,

267
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,752
and 3 blue sportsacs.

268
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:08,759
Mr. Clark, many bags
look alike.

269
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:11,125
In most cases,
specific descriptions

270
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:14,131
lead to apprehending
the suspect.

271
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,393
My bags didn't
murder anyone.

272
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:16,661
They just got lost.

273
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:17,997
Henry,
look at this.

274
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,503
All right, um,

275
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,097
my suitcase looks
something like that.

276
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:26,804
Would that be the 24-
or the 26-inch model?

277
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,403
Gee, honey, in my rush
to leave the house,

278
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,777
I forgot to
measure my bags.

279
00:12:29,848 --> 00:12:32,282
Oh, it looks
a little like this.

280
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,283
It's kinda rough,

281
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,944
but it'll
give you an idea.

282
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,080
Wow! Are you an artist?

283
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,250
Well, I used to be in advertising
with my husband.

284
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,022
This is
a fantastic drawing.

285
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,084
Thank you.

286
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,893
Unfortunately,
we don't have that bag.

287
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,367
Where will you be staying
in the Boston area?

288
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,564
In the Boston area, we will
be staying in New York.

289
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,436
Oh, Henry, calm down.
There's plenty of cabs.

290
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:56,940
It's not worth getting
a heart attack over.

291
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,442
You know, I should
have eaten something.

292
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,738
You know how dizzy
I get when I don't eat.

293
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,938
I'm, like, reeling.

294
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,640
I know. Well, there's
plenty of food on the train.

295
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,376
You just have
to go with the flow.

296
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,883
All right, you're right,
you're right.

297
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,384
I'm calming down.
I am going to calm down.

298
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,647
Good.

299
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,087
Thank you,
thank you.

300
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:13,090
What's that taste?

301
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:15,092
- What taste?
- Did you have peanut butter?

302
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,094
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Where did you get peanut butter?

303
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:18,356
I didn't have
peanut butter, Henry.

304
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,556
But you usually don't
taste like peanut butter.

305
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,361
Well, that's it. I'm
throwing away that lipstick.

306
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,695
You had peanut butter.

307
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:23,700
I did not.

308
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,701
Yes, you did.

309
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,794
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

310
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,168
All right,
I confess, ok?

311
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,399
I went to
the vending machine

312
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,406
while I was waiting
for the bags.

313
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,407
Aha!

314
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,704
I had 75 cents.

315
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,210
I put it into
the vending machine,

316
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:34,404
it didn't
make change,

317
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,777
and so I
ate them all!

318
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,247
How many were there?

319
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,248
2.

320
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,249
2? And I'm dizzy.

321
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,751
Oh, Henry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

322
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,252
It doesn't mean
I don't love you.

323
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,754
I, uh, hate
to interrupt,

324
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:44,914
but are we
going anywhere?

325
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,423
Oh, my God! I thought
we were already moving.

326
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,687
South Station. We have
10 minutes to catch a train.

327
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,228
Oh, my God!

328
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,930
Henry: Come on, come on,
we can make it!

329
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,597
All right, all right.

330
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,734
Aah!

331
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,037
Ohh!

332
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,543
Did we miss it?

333
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,877
Uh, the 3:38
to New York?

334
00:14:09,948 --> 00:14:10,972
Yeah.

335
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,381
We missed it.

336
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,748
This can't be happening.

337
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,980
Oh, Henry, if you're
a little late,

338
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,420
they won't mind.
They'll understand.

339
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,854
They do not give a position
of responsibility

340
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,620
to a man who cannot get
from Ohio to New York

341
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,718
in 24 hours.

342
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:23,887
But in the world
of advertising,

343
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:25,395
I really don't think
that makes any difference.

344
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:28,126
If you want to be
a messenger, maybe.

345
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,758
Do I have time to
go to the bathroom?

346
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,200
All the time
in the world.

347
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,202
Ok.

348
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,329
And don't worry, honey,

349
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,963
we'll get the next
train to New York.

350
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,508
No, we'll rent a car.
They... They don't leave without you,

351
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,476
and they don't get
diverted to Boston.

352
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,410
Ok. Ok, sweetie,
whatever.

353
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,412
I'll meet you...

354
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,470
5 minutes.

355
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,665

00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:40,603
You just go straight
across the Triborough Bridge,

535
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:43,936
onto the FDR, and we're right
into the heart of Manhattan.

536
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:45,737
All right.

537
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:49,002
Is that New York City
back there?

538
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,071
What are you
talking about?

539
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,946
Oh, no, this is the
George Washington Bridge.

540
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:54,075
This map...

541
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,586
What do you mean, the map?

542
00:20:56,654 --> 00:20:58,383
You think everything I do
is from reading the map?

Proceed down Grand Street.

544
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:06,396

Oh, don't feel bad.

546
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:09,523
He's obviously
been here before.

547
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,124
He knows the city.

548
00:21:11,202 --> 00:21:12,635
Well, I wouldn't have
been confused at all

549
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:14,432
if we'd come into the city
the right way.

550
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:17,338
Well, he is
not confused.

00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:20,876
- Huh?
- What's that?

553
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:22,139
It's French.

00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:23,475

this over here.

What did he say?

00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:34,017
It's Chinese or something.
Find Spanish. Just find Spanish.

560
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:35,422
No, what's he saying?

561
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:36,425
Find Spanish.

562
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:37,688
I can't find Spanish.

563
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,059

567
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:46,097
- Aah!
- Nancy, Nancy!

568
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,229
Turn! Turn! Turn!

575
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:12,122
How's your nose,
honey?

576
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:13,629
It's tender
to the touch,

577
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:15,063
just like me.

578
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:16,394
What's the bill?

579
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:19,095
Oh, it's $2,200.

580
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,899
I could have bought
a car for that.

581
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,599
Oh, I know.

582
00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:25,904
Oh, look at New York.

583
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,410

584
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:28,570
Honey, I want
to get to the hotel.

585
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:29,578
How do we get there?

586
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:30,579
That's very simple.

587
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:32,081
The streets
of New York

588
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:33,411
are laid out
on a rigid grid.

589
00:22:33,484 --> 00:22:35,247
Yeah, like somebody
else I know.

590
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,684
You want to
get there or not?

591
00:22:36,754 --> 00:22:39,917
Yes, I do. All right,
so we follow the rigid grid

592
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,925
to Park Avenue
and 64th Street.

593
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,086
But now, all right,
now wait, right now we're at...

594
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:45,924
No, don't look
around at the signs.

595
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,430
That's how people know
you're from out of town.

596
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:48,931
You don't want that, no.

597
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,695
And, by the way, there's
a walk New Yorkers have.

598
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:51,996
They never stroll.

599
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:53,263
They always look like
they have someplace,

600
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:54,429
you know, really
important to go to.

601
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:55,972
Ok.

602
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,473
It's gotta
be like, uh...

Ha ha ha ha ha.

605
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,204
You know, go ahead
and make fun, you know,

606
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,874
but you walk
like a tourist,

607
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,645
and that's how you
get in trouble.

608
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:10,147
I'm going to get
Eggs Benedict.

609
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:11,813
I'm going to have chicken,
mashed potatoes and gravy.

610
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:13,220
- That sounds good.
- I'm so hungry.

611
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,691
Excuse me. I'm terribly
sorry to disturb you.

612
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,523
I can't tell you how
embarrassing this is.

613
00:23:17,595 --> 00:23:19,927
I just left all my money
and credit cards in a cab.

614
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:21,931
I'm late to a rehearsal.

615
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:23,591
I've got a play on Broadway
at the moment.

616
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:24,930
If I could borrow
$5.00 for a taxi,

617
00:23:25,002 --> 00:23:26,230
you can come with me
to the theater.

618
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,236
I will pay you
back there.

619
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,499
You expect us
to believe this?

620
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,707
No. No, I suppose not. I'm
sorry to have bothered you.

622
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:35,302
Nancy,
there's no play.

623
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:36,903
Actually,
it's a revival

624
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:39,211
of Jesus Christ Superstar
at the Broadhurst Theater.

625
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:41,877
Do come if you
get the chance.

626
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,443
Wait a minute.
Jesus Christ Superstar?

627
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:45,011
Oh, my God. Are you

next week, and as I said...

00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:52,584
We love Jesus Christ
Superstar.

We saw
Phantom of the Opera.

633

And Evita.

634
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,958
- And Evita.
- That was so great.

635
00:23:58,035 --> 00:23:58,967

for us.

that year.

640
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:07,543
It didn't sing
like your cats.

00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:09,511
I'm Henry Clark, and
this is my wife Nancy.

642
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,741
A pleasure
to meet you both.

643
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:13,807
We'd be honored to
lend you anything.

644
00:24:13,884 --> 00:24:15,146
Oh, no. Please.
You mustn't take out

an open wallet
in the city,

646
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,885
no matter how much the
crime rate's dropped.

647
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:19,889
Yeah, well, l...
I entered Yokelville.

648
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:21,891
Come on... Come over
here. Come on.

649
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,392
I am so embarrassed
about this.

650
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,486
No, don't be embarrassed.

on the plane.

stay in the back

Yes, here we are.

at all I can do

700

to make your stay
more pleasant,

701
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:06,487
please don't hesitate
to let me know.

702
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,496
That would be
room service.

703

We haven't eaten
since this morning.

704
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,529
Oh, we're starving.

00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:11,533
I will send a complimentary
basket of fruit and cheese

up to your room immediately,

along, perhaps,
with a fine merlot?

708

just have an imprint

You wouldn't believe
what we've been through.

714
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,013
First our flight
was rerouted.

715
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,519
Then they sent us
to Boston.

716
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,020
And then when
we finally got here,

717
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,954
we were mugged
by Andrew Lloyd Webber.

718

Well, I'll certainly

tell you something,

but I want you to
promise not to lose it.

756
00:27:54,705 --> 00:27:56,138
See, she couldn't stay
in the med school dorms

757
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,640
because that was just
for enrolled students,

758
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:59,141
and she was looking
for an apartment

759
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,643
once she decided that
she was gonna drop out

760
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:02,144
and become an actress,

761
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,908
and that's why I gave her
the credit card.

762
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:05,278
So don't be mad at her,
Henry. Be mad at me.

at both of you?

Henry, it's her life.

It took a lot of courage
to drop out.

Well, isn't this
the same situation?

No, because I went to him,
and I discussed it with him.

793

Well, then we're
going to Susan's,

It's a great group.

Sit right down.
Let's begin.

907
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:54,922
First of all, I'd like
to welcome our new members.

If you could
introduce yourselves...

is Nancy,

my husband Henry.

Hello.

913
00:34:05,442 --> 00:34:09,173
Welcome. Last week, we were
discussing Edward's problem.

914
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:10,372
Edward?

915
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:11,379
It's ok.

916
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,885
I'd like to start off
by letting everyone know

917
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:18,478
how much your support
has meant to me.

918
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:20,716

have to go.

Henry, Nancy,

922
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:29,095
you're giving Edward
a very negative message.

923
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,293
- Yeah?
- Sit down, please.

924
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,905
We don't want to send
a negative message.

925

Not too close.

926
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:41,033
So, Edward, how was
last week for you?

927
00:34:41,111 --> 00:34:44,080
It's been really wonderful,
thank you. Uh...

928
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:46,081
I've been concentrating
on translating

929
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:49,915
the sexual impulse into
other forms of expression.

so just my doctor.

from the new people.

What about
you folks?

Actually, we just got
in here by mistake.

943

We really came in
to worship,

944
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:28,048

the wrong denomination.

I mean,

00:35:30,193 --> 00:35:32,161
actually, we don't really
even have sex that much.

- Hmm?

is lack of sex.

Tell us more.

950
00:35:37,334 --> 00:35:39,268
You know something?
We're from Ohio,

951
00:35:39,336 --> 00:35:41,270
and we really don't
discuss sex in public.

It's sort of
our state motto.

953
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:46,475
Well, actually, um...
that's part of the problem,

954
00:35:46,543 --> 00:35:48,101
is that
we don't discuss it.

Nancy,
we're from Ohio.

956

But we don't even really
do it very much anymore.

957
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,074

it's probably programmed

in spontaneity.

both come to accept

this lack of physical
and emotional intimacy.

The only thing you have
to be ashamed of, Henry,

is not telling me.

do we have?

run out their contracts.

1033
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:33,871
Apparently,
if you're over 40,

00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,377
you're not
cutting-edge anymore.

1035
00:38:35,445 --> 00:38:38,380
Well, that's ridiculous.
You were never cutting-edge.

forget about Sellinski.

I'm not giving up.

1046

can still get the job

and you give up. I
don't have that option.

What is it?

1051
00:39:04,574 --> 00:39:08,010
It's a test. Here we are
in the middle of our lives,

a decision to make.

or are we gonna
embrace life?

1055
00:39:14,484 --> 00:39:15,974
Slow march toward death?

1056
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:19,180
No! Embrace life!

1057
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:22,817
I want to live!
I want to feel useful!

1058
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:24,485
I want to explore
and experience!

1059
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:28,861
I... I want to suck the marrow
out of life, Henry!

1060
00:39:28,932 --> 00:39:30,331
What do you want?

1061
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,528
Well, l... I definitely want
to do some marrow-sucking.

1062
00:39:33,603 --> 00:39:35,537
Uh, but otherwise,
I think I...

1063
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:38,039
I just want to catch up
on my reading...

1064
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:41,703
and, you know, fix those
kitchen cabinets that are broken.

1065
00:39:41,778 --> 00:39:43,712
That's it? That's all you want to do

1066
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,714
is just sit home
fixing things and reading

1067
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:47,875
for the rest
of your life?

1068
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:51,387
'Cause I don't know how
I fit into that plan, Henry.

1069
00:39:51,454 --> 00:39:53,854
All you need is
a good light and a hammer.

1070
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:57,618
Maybe we have
different plans.

1071
00:39:58,695 --> 00:40:00,219
Oh, come on, Henry.

1072
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:01,992
Come on, think.

1073
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:04,829
Think, honey.
There must be something.

1074
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:07,401
Well...

1075
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,402
um...

1076
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:10,405
I'd like to get
some food. I'm hungry.

1077
00:40:10,473 --> 00:40:12,407
And, you know, uh...
we don't have any bags.

1078
00:40:12,475 --> 00:40:14,409
We don't have any money,
so that's a...

1079
00:40:14,477 --> 00:40:16,240
Bags! Oh! Henry!

1080
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:18,247
The bags! Remember?
When we went to Freeport?

1081
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:19,907
We can't eat
the bags.

1082
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:21,416
I know we can't
eat the bags.

1083
00:40:21,484 --> 00:40:23,418
Remember when we went
to Freeport and you told me

1084
00:40:23,486 --> 00:40:25,420
to put the travelers' checks
inside the bag?

1085
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:27,786
They're in the bag! Let's go
back to the hotel and find them.

1086
00:40:27,857 --> 00:40:29,290
You left them
in the bag?

1087
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,792
I left them
in the bag.

1088
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,952
You left... how much?

1089
00:40:32,028 --> 00:40:33,120
- $600.
- $600?

1090
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:35,130
It's not earning interest
when it's in the bag.

1091
00:40:35,198 --> 00:40:37,767
Oh, stop it.

1092
00:40:39,735 --> 00:40:41,430
Here he is.

1093
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:44,868
We're back.

1094
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,738
Mr. And Mrs. Clark,
the sequel.

1095
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,038
Did our luggage
get here yet?

1096
00:40:49,111 --> 00:40:50,544
I'm afraid not,
but I'll let you know

1097
00:40:50,613 --> 00:40:52,547
the moment it arrives,
if you care to write the name

1098
00:40:52,615 --> 00:40:54,082
of your hostel there.

1099
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,276
Very funny.

1100
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:57,251
But how very nice
to see you!

1101
00:40:57,319 --> 00:40:59,787
Oh... thank you. You know,
it's so nice to...

1102
00:40:59,855 --> 00:41:01,117
How was Monte Carlo?

1103
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,055
Oh, it would
not stop raining.

1104
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,524
Damn the French!

1105
00:41:04,593 --> 00:41:05,855
The doorman at the curb

1106
00:41:05,928 --> 00:41:07,293
did not help Mrs. Wellstone
out of the car.

1107
00:41:07,363 --> 00:41:08,387
Damn the doorman.

1108
00:41:08,464 --> 00:41:09,897
He was helping some large,
unfortunate woman

1109
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:11,227
with a crated animal.

1110
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,927
They should've
both been crated.

1111
00:41:13,002 --> 00:41:14,094
Good point.

1112
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,831
I'll have all three of them
removed immediately.

1113
00:41:15,905 --> 00:41:17,236
Now, that is the kind
of service I expect.

1114
00:41:17,306 --> 00:41:20,241
And that's
the kind of service

1115
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:21,742
you shall receive,
Mr. Wellstone,

1116
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:23,073
as long as
I'm aboveground.

1117
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:25,045
Mrs. Wellstone: Maybe you two
should get a room together.

1118
00:41:25,114 --> 00:41:27,105
Mersault:
I'm here to serve.

1119
00:41:27,183 --> 00:41:28,343
You and me both.

1120
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:30,908
Now, is there anything
at all that I can get you?

1121
00:41:30,986 --> 00:41:34,615
Just make sure that it
doesn't rain while we're here.

1122
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:35,850
I'll speak
to housekeeping.

1123
00:41:35,925 --> 00:41:39,759
And, um, Mrs. Wellstone,
I just love those shoes.

1124
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:41,592
Don't break my heart

1125
00:41:41,664 --> 00:41:44,258
and tell me they're
not real leopard.

1126
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:45,459
Mmm, hmm.

1127
00:41:45,534 --> 00:41:46,933
Ha ha ha ha!

1128
00:41:47,002 --> 00:41:48,435
Come on, come on.

1129
00:41:48,504 --> 00:41:50,131
Mr. Wellstone:
Off we go.

1130
00:41:56,345 --> 00:41:58,438
Henry, look!

1131
00:41:58,514 --> 00:42:00,846
I don't want
to get you too excited,

1132
00:42:00,916 --> 00:42:02,508
but I think
they have trail mix.

1133
00:42:02,585 --> 00:42:03,847
Buffet time,
honey.

1134
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:06,217
I'm gonna find a bathroom.
Order me a peanut.

1135
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:13,485
Thank you.

1136
00:42:14,964 --> 00:42:15,988
Ohhh...

1137
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:19,725
[Crunching Loudly]

1138
00:42:19,802 --> 00:42:20,734
Mmm.

[Chuckling]

1141
00:42:24,273 --> 00:42:26,002
Special diet?

1142
00:42:26,075 --> 00:42:28,134
Mm-hmm.

1143
00:42:30,312 --> 00:42:31,904
Could I get you something
to drink with that?

1144
00:42:31,981 --> 00:42:33,744
Oh, no, thank you.
I wouldn't want to impose.

1145
00:42:33,816 --> 00:42:35,010
Oh, no imposition.

1146
00:42:35,084 --> 00:42:36,711
Are you sure
I couldn't get you...

1147
00:42:36,785 --> 00:42:37,717
Champagne.

1148
00:42:37,786 --> 00:42:40,016
Champagne
for the lady.

1149
00:42:40,089 --> 00:42:41,420
Thank you.

1150
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,923
[Crunching Loudly]

1151
00:42:42,992 --> 00:42:45,051
Can I have some
of those cherries, please?

1152
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:46,526
Sure.

1153
00:42:46,595 --> 00:42:48,392
No, the whole thing.
The whole thing.

1154
00:42:48,464 --> 00:42:50,091
Thank you.

1155
00:42:50,165 --> 00:42:51,097
Mm-hmm.

1156
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:53,100
Mmm. Oh,
thank you.

1157
00:42:53,168 --> 00:42:56,103
Hi. I'm... I'm Greg.
I'm here from L.A.

1158
00:42:56,171 --> 00:42:57,604
I'm an agent.

1159
00:42:57,673 --> 00:42:59,106
I'm on my way
down to the Village

1160
00:42:59,174 --> 00:43:00,607
to check out
this new Irish playwright

1161
00:43:00,676 --> 00:43:02,371
for a sitcom
that I packaged.

1162
00:43:02,444 --> 00:43:03,877
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

1163
00:43:03,946 --> 00:43:05,937
Actually, I've got
an extra ticket,

1164
00:43:06,015 --> 00:43:09,246
and I do have a limo...
if you'd be interested.

1165
00:43:11,787 --> 00:43:13,721
Are you staying
in the hotel, Greg?

1166
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:15,723
Yes. Suite.
14th floor.

1167
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:18,692
Mmm. Are you alone?

1168
00:43:20,296 --> 00:43:21,923
Just me and
my expense account.

1169
00:43:21,997 --> 00:43:23,259
[Chuckles Loudly]

1170
00:43:23,332 --> 00:43:24,765
You're funny, Greg.

1171
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:26,323
Hey, baby,
how's it goin'?

1172
00:43:26,402 --> 00:43:29,963
Oh, shut up.
What are you, 106?

1173
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:32,132
Let's move
to a table.

1174
00:43:32,207 --> 00:43:34,072
It won't be so noisy.

1175
00:43:34,143 --> 00:43:36,202
Ok. Yeah, sure.

1176
00:43:47,156 --> 00:43:48,088
Well.

1177
00:43:48,157 --> 00:43:50,387
So... do you
come here often?

1178
00:43:50,459 --> 00:43:52,723
Only when my husband
works late.

1179
00:43:52,795 --> 00:43:54,524
You're married. I'm sorry.
I never would've...

1180
00:43:54,596 --> 00:43:58,396
No. Uh, actually, I think
my husband's having an affair.

1181
00:43:58,467 --> 00:43:59,399
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1182
00:43:59,468 --> 00:44:00,799
Really.

1183
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:02,769
In fact, I wish he'd
stay out more often.

1184
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:04,100
You know. Yeah.

1185
00:44:04,173 --> 00:44:05,538
[Chuckles]

1186
00:44:05,607 --> 00:44:06,904
Look, I don't
want to seem

1187
00:44:06,976 --> 00:44:08,409
like one of those
successful guys

1188
00:44:08,477 --> 00:44:10,411
that blows in
from the West Coast

1189
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:11,912
for a few meetings
and a good time,

1190
00:44:11,981 --> 00:44:13,710
but if you wanted to
get together anytime...

1191
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:16,307
Give me the key
to your room, Greg.

1192
00:44:17,586 --> 00:44:18,553
What?

1193
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,554
Oh, come on. Let's not
play games, Greg.

1194
00:44:20,622 --> 00:44:22,556
You know what
we're talking about.

1195
00:44:22,624 --> 00:44:24,387
Ha ha! I was wondering

1196
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,985
if I might speak
with you for a moment?

1197
00:44:27,062 --> 00:44:28,962
No! Creep.

1198
00:44:29,031 --> 00:44:30,965
I am trying to
have a conversation

1199
00:44:31,033 --> 00:44:31,965
with this gentleman.
Ok?

1200
00:44:32,034 --> 00:44:32,966
Please stop
harassing me,

1201
00:44:33,035 --> 00:44:35,196
or I'm gonna call
the manager.

1202
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:37,864
Now, go away.
Just go!

1203
00:44:38,974 --> 00:44:40,066
Oh!

1204
00:44:40,142 --> 00:44:41,074
That's sick.

1205
00:44:41,143 --> 00:44:42,235
Yeah, I know.

trying to pick up

someone like you.

1208

I have to leave.

are bunching up.

want to leave.

He's chatting me up.

It's, like, you know...
It's pathetic.

Yes.

- So, Greg...
- Mmm?

1215
00:44:56,992 --> 00:44:59,927
Is what I think gonna
happen gonna happen?

Mmm? 'Cause if it is,

night of your life.

around 10:00, 10:30.

Is that good?

I'll be waiting
in your room.

No. No, I don't.

You know,

is that you have
to learn to let go,

Let's go.

1754
01:04:35,435 --> 01:04:36,459
Nancy!

1755
01:04:37,704 --> 01:04:39,467
Nancy!

1756
01:04:39,539 --> 01:04:40,471
Henry?

1757
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,633
Nancy!

1758
01:04:42,709 --> 01:04:43,971
Henry.

1759
01:04:44,043 --> 01:04:45,476
This is a mistake.

1760
01:04:45,545 --> 01:04:47,672
If you call Dun & Bradley
Advertising,

1761
01:04:47,747 --> 01:04:49,180
they'll tell you

1762
01:04:49,249 --> 01:04:50,682
I have an interview there
this morning.

1763
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:53,218
I'm not a criminal,
I'm not a degenerate,

1764
01:04:53,286 --> 01:04:56,278
and I don't deserve
to be locked up with...

1765
01:04:56,356 --> 01:04:59,257
...out proper
medical attention.

1766
01:04:59,325 --> 01:05:00,451
I have a severely
sprained neck.

1767
01:05:00,526 --> 01:05:02,517
We'll straighten
that out for you.

1768
01:05:02,595 --> 01:05:05,530
[Laughter]

1769
01:05:05,598 --> 01:05:09,500
This is Sergeant Jordan
at the desk at the 1-5.

1770
01:05:09,569 --> 01:05:11,230
When's your commanding
officer gonna be back?

1771
01:05:11,304 --> 01:05:15,365
He's on lunch break.
Oh, great.

1772
01:05:15,441 --> 01:05:17,534
You got some racket there.
It's a long lunch break.

1773
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:20,135
Great. All right.
Let me give you

1774
01:05:20,213 --> 01:05:21,578
the information on this,
all right?

1775
01:05:21,648 --> 01:05:23,309
The woman's name
is Florence Klein,

1776
01:05:23,383 --> 01:05:25,647
and she's at 585
Beck Avenue. Right.

1777
01:05:25,718 --> 01:05:26,844
Hello.

1778
01:05:26,919 --> 01:05:28,853
Correct. Lady,
I'm busy. Not now.

1779
01:05:28,921 --> 01:05:29,979
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, ok.

1780
01:05:30,056 --> 01:05:31,751
I have a little bit
of a problem.

1781
01:05:31,824 --> 01:05:33,382
My husband has a job
interview in 2 hours,

1782
01:05:33,459 --> 01:05:35,154
and I need
to use the phone

1783
01:05:35,228 --> 01:05:36,957
because I have
to arrange for bail.

1784
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:38,930
Public phones are right
down the hallway there.

1785
01:05:38,998 --> 01:05:41,159
I know, but that'll take
at least an hour,

1786
01:05:41,234 --> 01:05:42,929
and I don't have
that kind of time.

1787
01:05:43,002 --> 01:05:44,731
And if I could just
use your phone,

1788
01:05:44,804 --> 01:05:46,271
I promise I'll call
collect and l...

1789
01:05:46,339 --> 01:05:48,739
Lady. Give me
a break, ok?

1790
01:05:48,808 --> 01:05:52,073
Give you a break?

1791
01:05:53,346 --> 01:05:55,906
Give you a break?

1792
01:05:55,982 --> 01:05:57,347
- Hey!
- [Ding]

1793
01:05:57,417 --> 01:05:59,385
Let me share
something with you.

1794
01:05:59,452 --> 01:06:01,386
In the last 24 hours,

1795
01:06:01,454 --> 01:06:05,015
I have been rerouted,
mugged, evicted,

1796
01:06:05,091 --> 01:06:07,116
chased by a dog,
kidnapped,

1797
01:06:07,193 --> 01:06:08,558
chased by a horse,

1798
01:06:08,628 --> 01:06:10,562
and seen in a compromising
position by the mayor.

1799
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:11,995
I just found out
that my daughter

1800
01:06:12,065 --> 01:06:13,430
is spending us
into the poorhouse

1801
01:06:13,499 --> 01:06:15,194
and that my husband
has no job.

1802
01:06:15,268 --> 01:06:18,635
I'm angry, I'm tired,
and I'm hungry,

1803
01:06:18,705 --> 01:06:20,332
and I'm running
with the wolves!

1804
01:06:20,406 --> 01:06:23,204
And right now, I am one
crazy bitch from Ohio!

1805
01:06:23,276 --> 01:06:25,210
So why don't you
give me a break!

1806
01:06:31,784 --> 01:06:34,150
Do I dial 9 to get out?

1807
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:35,812
Officer, I got

1808
01:06:35,888 --> 01:06:37,048
the most important meeting
of my life in 2 hours.

1809
01:06:37,123 --> 01:06:38,055
Can't you just call
somebody or spea...

1810
01:06:38,124 --> 01:06:39,716
What you makin'
all that noise for?

1811
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:43,159
Forget it. You can scream
in here till you croak.

1812
01:06:43,229 --> 01:06:45,163
The whole damn thing
gives me a headache.

1813
01:06:45,231 --> 01:06:46,664
I got one.

1814
01:06:46,733 --> 01:06:48,894
Well, take an aspirin.

1815
01:06:48,968 --> 01:06:52,529
Anything to shut
your mouth up.

1816
01:06:52,605 --> 01:06:53,537
Thank you.

1817
01:06:53,606 --> 01:06:54,971
[Sigh]

1818
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:56,474
Nobody home?

1819
01:06:56,542 --> 01:06:58,806
No. My daughter's
not there.

1820
01:06:58,878 --> 01:07:00,140
My son's somewhere
in London.

1821
01:07:00,213 --> 01:07:02,113
I don't know anybody
else in New York.

1822
01:07:02,181 --> 01:07:03,443
Well, where
are you staying?

1823
01:07:03,516 --> 01:07:04,949
Can't your hotel
give you a loan?

1824
01:07:05,017 --> 01:07:06,450
Oh, my God.

1825
01:07:06,519 --> 01:07:08,111
The manager threw us
out of the hotel.

1826
01:07:08,187 --> 01:07:09,279
He hates us.

1827
01:07:09,355 --> 01:07:10,447
He wouldn't eve...

1828
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,349
<i>Toot toot</i>

1829
01:07:15,428 --> 01:07:16,395
<i>Hey</i>

1830
01:07:16,462 --> 01:07:17,656
<i>Beep beep</i>

1831
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:20,756
So you saw the "do not
disturb" sign on the door...

1832
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:21,765
Yes.

1833
01:07:21,834 --> 01:07:23,267
And then you knocked

1834
01:07:23,336 --> 01:07:24,667
to see if it was
supposed to be out there.

1835
01:07:24,737 --> 01:07:25,999
Sir. I have
a call for you.

1836
01:07:26,072 --> 01:07:27,130
Excuse me, Howard.

1837
01:07:27,206 --> 01:07:28,764
I'll explain the rest
of your life to you

1838
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:30,308
in a moment.

1839
01:07:30,376 --> 01:07:31,536
Thank you so much,
Michelle.

1840
01:07:31,611 --> 01:07:33,044
Good morning.
Mersault speaking.

1841
01:07:33,112 --> 01:07:34,636
Nancy: Mr. Mersault?

1842
01:07:34,714 --> 01:07:37,410
Hi. This is Nancy Clark
from Ohio.

1843
01:07:37,483 --> 01:07:39,576
You threw us out of
your hotel last night.

1844
01:07:39,652 --> 01:07:41,085
How are you?

1845
01:07:41,154 --> 01:07:42,644
Oh, I'm very well,
thank you.

1846
01:07:42,722 --> 01:07:44,155
How nice of you
to stay in touch.

1847
01:07:44,223 --> 01:07:45,713
I wish all our freeloaders
were as conscientious.

1848
01:07:45,792 --> 01:07:47,692
Well, as much as I would
like to chew the fat,

1849
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,227
this really isn't
a courtesy call.

1850
01:07:49,295 --> 01:07:50,728
I need you
to do me a favor.

1851
01:07:50,797 --> 01:07:52,321
Mrs. Clark,
let me explain.

1852
01:07:52,398 --> 01:07:55,162
If you are a paying
guest at this hotel,

1853
01:07:55,234 --> 01:07:56,667
I fawn, I grovel.

1854
01:07:56,736 --> 01:07:58,795
I am, in fact,
your very plaything.

1855
01:07:58,871 --> 01:08:00,168
But if you're not a guest,
you do not exist.

1856
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:02,104
So there is no need
for me to talk to you.

1857
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,006
Oh, I think you're
definitely

1858
01:08:04,076 --> 01:08:05,941
gonna want to speak
to me, Mr. Mersault.

1859
01:08:06,012 --> 01:08:07,604
Why on Earth
would that be?

1860
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,669
Because last night
at the hotel,

1861
01:08:08,748 --> 01:08:11,581
you looked so fabulous

1862
01:08:11,651 --> 01:08:13,915
in that wonderful
full-length sable coat.

1863
01:08:13,986 --> 01:08:17,547
And those stiletto heels
were absolutely...

1864
01:08:17,623 --> 01:08:18,715
Go away.

1865
01:08:20,293 --> 01:08:21,385
Yes?

1866
01:08:21,461 --> 01:08:23,395
And I must tell you

1867
01:08:23,463 --> 01:08:25,954
that I have never seen
a man kick so high.

1868
01:08:26,032 --> 01:08:27,727
And after they
send you to jail,

1869
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:28,960
you can do
your little act

1870
01:08:29,035 --> 01:08:30,366
for all the prisoners.

1871
01:08:30,436 --> 01:08:31,630
They'll love it.

1872
01:08:31,704 --> 01:08:33,137
Congratulations,
Mrs. Clark.

1873
01:08:33,206 --> 01:08:34,935
I had an intuition
you'd be good at blackmail.

1874
01:08:35,007 --> 01:08:37,805
So, uh, how may I be
of service to you?

1875
01:08:37,877 --> 01:08:39,640
I need bail money
at the 15th Precinct,

1876
01:08:39,712 --> 01:08:41,236
and I need it here
right now.

1877
01:08:41,314 --> 01:08:42,941
And bring some muffins.

1878
01:08:43,015 --> 01:08:44,880
But, of course.

1879
01:08:44,951 --> 01:08:46,350
Muffins.

1880
01:08:48,421 --> 01:08:50,252
The presidential suite

1881
01:08:50,323 --> 01:08:51,756
comes with the compliments
of the hotel,

1882
01:08:51,824 --> 01:08:52,791
as, of course,
does the limo.

1883
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:54,349
Or should I say
getaway car?

1884
01:08:54,427 --> 01:08:55,621
Now before we get
to the hotel,

1885
01:08:55,695 --> 01:08:58,163
I'd just like you to sign
this document, if you would,

1886
01:08:58,231 --> 01:09:00,699
agreeing never to discuss,
disclose, or reveal

1887
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:03,064
the incident at the hotel
when I was, in fact,

1888
01:09:03,135 --> 01:09:05,160
rehearsing for the hotel
employees' follies.

1889
01:09:05,238 --> 01:09:06,296
Thank you so much.

1890
01:09:06,372 --> 01:09:08,101
Very good.

1891
01:09:08,174 --> 01:09:10,005
You look great.

1892
01:09:10,076 --> 01:09:11,008
Thanks, sweetie.

1893
01:09:11,077 --> 01:09:13,102
You look really great.

1894
01:09:13,179 --> 01:09:14,111
Thanks.

1895
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:15,147
Doesn't she look great?

1896
01:09:15,214 --> 01:09:16,977
Well, I wouldn't
mind the blouse.

1897
01:09:17,049 --> 01:09:18,175
No, not the blouse.

1898
01:09:18,251 --> 01:09:19,741
I mean, she just
looks great.

1899
01:09:19,819 --> 01:09:22,686
[Hushed] She's got
a great ass.

1900
01:09:22,755 --> 01:09:24,245
Henry?

1901
01:09:24,323 --> 01:09:26,154
Well, it is. It's just
always there for me.

1902
01:09:26,225 --> 01:09:27,157
Oh.

1903
01:09:27,226 --> 01:09:29,057
It's been a wellspring
of joy, really.

1904
01:09:29,128 --> 01:09:30,220
A what?

1905
01:09:30,296 --> 01:09:31,627
What do you think?

1906
01:09:31,697 --> 01:09:32,857
Well, I think
it's a private, uh...

1907
01:09:32,932 --> 01:09:34,126
Well, come on. I mean,
everybody knows.

1908
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,565
It's the elephant
in the room,

1909
01:09:35,635 --> 01:09:36,624
and now we're finally
talking about it.

1910
01:09:36,702 --> 01:09:38,135
Henry, what is
wrong with you?

1911
01:09:38,204 --> 01:09:39,671
Nothing.

1912
01:09:39,739 --> 01:09:40,671
Uh?

1913
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:43,800
I just feel frisky,
that's all.

1914
01:09:43,876 --> 01:09:45,810
You feel frisky?

1915
01:09:45,878 --> 01:09:48,005
Frisky. Frisky.

1916
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,445
Say the word "frisky."

1917
01:09:49,515 --> 01:09:50,447
Frisky.

1918
01:09:50,516 --> 01:09:51,642
- Frisky.
- Yeah.

1919
01:09:51,717 --> 01:09:52,649
Say "frisky" again.

1920
01:09:52,718 --> 01:09:53,650
Frisky, Henry.

1921
01:09:53,719 --> 01:09:54,777
Frisky. Say "frisky."

1922
01:09:54,854 --> 01:09:56,219
Say the word
"frisky."

1923
01:09:56,289 --> 01:09:57,779
Frisky.

1924
01:09:57,857 --> 01:09:59,620
Frisky. Say "frisky."

1925
01:09:59,692 --> 01:10:01,489
Frisky.

1926
01:10:01,561 --> 01:10:02,528
Frisky. Say the word

Ok, Henry.

2106
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:37,157
We're here.

2107
01:15:37,228 --> 01:15:39,093
Come on, sweetie.

2108
01:15:44,836 --> 01:15:46,326
Henry?

2109
01:15:46,404 --> 01:15:47,769
This is not right.

2110
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,636
What? Yes, it is, Henry.
It is right.

2111
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:50,902
This is the floor, honey.

2112
01:15:50,975 --> 01:15:52,567
Oh, I just can't
do this.

2113
01:15:52,644 --> 01:15:53,906
Henry! What?

2114
01:15:53,978 --> 01:15:55,843
No, Henry, you're
just stressed-out.

2115
01:15:55,914 --> 01:15:57,472
I mean, everything
is fine.

2116
01:15:57,549 --> 01:15:59,346
Just don't mention
that tongue idea.

2117
01:15:59,417 --> 01:16:00,850
Come on, honey.
Take my hand.

2118
01:16:00,919 --> 01:16:01,851
Ok.

2119
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,387
- Come on.
- All rightie.

2120
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:05,013
Ok, Henry, now I
want you to visualize

2121
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:08,218
getting off the elevator.

2122
01:16:08,293 --> 01:16:09,225
I'm visualizing.

2123
01:16:09,294 --> 01:16:10,226
- Ok.
- Coming off...

2124
01:16:10,295 --> 01:16:11,262
the elevator.
My hand's out.

2125
01:16:11,329 --> 01:16:12,523
That feels good.

2126
01:16:12,597 --> 01:16:13,529
It's a different
temperature, though.

2127
01:16:13,598 --> 01:16:14,724
Is it, honey?
Come on.

2128
01:16:14,799 --> 01:16:15,925
You're gonna make it,
Henry.

2129
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,661
My hair is out.
My hair.

2130
01:16:17,736 --> 01:16:18,828
Good.

2131
01:16:18,903 --> 01:16:19,892
Your foot's out.

2132
01:16:19,971 --> 01:16:21,370
Just put your foot out.

2133
01:16:21,439 --> 01:16:22,371
I just... I...

2134
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:23,930
Come on.
Come on, baby.

2135
01:16:24,008 --> 01:16:25,498
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

2136
01:16:25,577 --> 01:16:26,703
I'm just
burned out.

2137
01:16:26,778 --> 01:16:28,075
I'm just going
through the motions.

2138
01:16:28,146 --> 01:16:30,011
I can't get out.
I know what he means.

2139
01:16:30,081 --> 01:16:31,013
What's your name?

2140
01:16:31,082 --> 01:16:32,014
Paul.

2141
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:33,015
We just can't
do this anymore.

2142
01:16:33,084 --> 01:16:35,245
Henry, Henry,
don't be irresponsible.

2143
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:38,619
I know that you took
a hallucinogenic in prison.

2144
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:42,057
But this does not mean
that you can't make an effort.

2145
01:16:42,127 --> 01:16:43,685
- I can't.
- We can't!

2146
01:16:43,762 --> 01:16:45,354
You're not helping!

2147
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:47,489
Henry, who are you
gonna listen to,

2148
01:16:47,565 --> 01:16:50,125
your loving, trusting wife
of 27 years

2149
01:16:50,201 --> 01:16:51,190
or this guy?

2150
01:16:51,269 --> 01:16:52,361
He understands me,

2151
01:16:52,437 --> 01:16:54,064
and you just can't
handle that, can you?

2152
01:16:54,139 --> 01:16:56,130
We're one now.

2153
01:16:56,207 --> 01:16:57,299
Let's go, honey.

2154
01:16:57,375 --> 01:17:00,242
Yeah. Ok, good, Henry.

2155
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:03,340
Let's go.

2156
01:17:04,949 --> 01:17:07,076
So I go, no way.
And he goes, oh, so way.

2157
01:17:07,152 --> 01:17:08,380
Excuse me...

2158
01:17:08,453 --> 01:17:10,148
I go, you are
totally stupid.

2159
01:17:10,221 --> 01:17:11,153
Excuse me.

2160
01:17:11,222 --> 01:17:12,587
Hold on.
Can I help you?

2161
01:17:12,657 --> 01:17:14,249
I'm Henry Clark
to see Lisa Tobin.

2162
01:17:14,325 --> 01:17:15,257
Oh, you're Henry Clark.

2163
01:17:15,326 --> 01:17:17,920
I called your
house in Ohio,

2164
01:17:17,996 --> 01:17:19,520
and I tried leaving a message
at the hotel for you,

2165
01:17:19,597 --> 01:17:21,087
but they said you
hadn't checked in.

2166
01:17:21,166 --> 01:17:22,428
The meeting was
moved to 9:00.

2167
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:25,333
Are you serious?

2168
01:17:25,403 --> 01:17:27,337
We didn't get
that message.

2169
01:17:27,405 --> 01:17:28,429
There's nothing
I can do.

2170
01:17:28,506 --> 01:17:30,269
I know, but, you know,
we had trouble

2171
01:17:30,341 --> 01:17:31,308
getting into the hotel...

2172
01:17:31,376 --> 01:17:32,536
We didn't get
our messages.

2173
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:34,771
The manager's
a transvestite.

2174
01:17:34,846 --> 01:17:36,609
Ms. Tobin is preparing for
a meeting with some clients.

2175
01:17:36,681 --> 01:17:38,239
Then she flies to London
for a week.

2176
01:17:38,316 --> 01:17:39,943
Sorry.

2177
01:17:40,018 --> 01:17:41,007
There must be
something you can do.

2178
01:17:41,085 --> 01:17:42,017
I mean...

2179
01:17:42,086 --> 01:17:43,610
See, this is a sign.

2180
01:17:43,688 --> 01:17:44,677
It's over.

2181
01:17:44,756 --> 01:17:46,246
Henry,
don't say that.

2182
01:17:46,324 --> 01:17:47,586
Nancy, look out there.

2183
01:17:47,659 --> 01:17:49,524
It's an entire city
saying "go home."

2184
01:17:49,594 --> 01:17:51,459
You know what it says
on the Statue of Liberty?

2185
01:17:51,529 --> 01:17:53,258
"Give me your tired,
give me your poor.

2186
01:17:53,331 --> 01:17:55,128
Give me everybody
but Henry and Nancy Clark."

2187
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,690
Henry, you're hungry.

2188
01:17:56,768 --> 01:17:57,996
If I just
get you a cracker,

2189
01:17:58,069 --> 01:17:59,400
you'll be filled
with hope again.

2190
01:17:59,470 --> 01:18:01,097
No, I'll just be
filled with cracker.

2191
01:18:01,172 --> 01:18:02,104
It's over.

2192
01:18:02,173 --> 01:18:03,401
What about
marrow-sucking?

2193
01:18:03,474 --> 01:18:05,237
What about
embracing life?

2194
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:06,971
Nancy, we're
too old for that.

2195
01:18:11,249 --> 01:18:12,546
Ok.

2196
01:18:13,785 --> 01:18:15,446
All right, Henry.

2197
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,509
The plane leaves
at 2:30.

2198
01:18:16,588 --> 01:18:19,284
I'm gonna be on it.

2199
01:18:19,357 --> 01:18:21,484
I'm gonna go back
to the hotel.

2200
01:18:21,559 --> 01:18:23,527
I have just
enough energy to...

2201
01:18:23,595 --> 01:18:26,257
steal some towels from
the presidential suite.

2202
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:27,889
[Elevator Bell Dings]

2203
01:18:27,966 --> 01:18:29,092
Well, Henry...

2204
01:18:30,335 --> 01:18:32,565
I guess New York won.

2205
01:18:40,812 --> 01:18:42,643
New York won.

2206
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:47,275
New York won?

2207
01:18:51,256 --> 01:18:53,747
Uh-huh.
No, it's permanent.

2208
01:18:53,825 --> 01:18:55,190
You never have
to wax again.

2209
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:56,284
Excuse me.

2210
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:57,293
Of course it hurts.

2211
01:18:57,362 --> 01:18:58,624
Oh, it is so
totally worth it.

2212
01:18:58,696 --> 01:19:00,391
I mean, what,
with global warming,

2213
01:19:00,465 --> 01:19:01,796
you're gonna be in a bathing
suit all year long.

2214
01:19:01,866 --> 01:19:03,333
I'm sorry. This is an emergency.
If I could just...

2215
01:19:03,401 --> 01:19:05,528
Gimme a break, ok?

2216
01:19:05,603 --> 01:19:06,797
Sorry. Go ahead.

2217
01:19:06,871 --> 01:19:09,135
Give you a break?

2218
01:19:09,207 --> 01:19:11,175
Give you a break?

2219
01:19:11,242 --> 01:19:14,234
Hey... listen.

2220
01:19:14,312 --> 01:19:16,906
In the past 24 hours,
I have destroyed a car,

2221
01:19:16,981 --> 01:19:18,278
been thrown out
of a hotel,

2222
01:19:18,349 --> 01:19:20,010
forced to reveal my
most intimate secrets

2223
01:19:20,084 --> 01:19:22,279
to a group of nymphomaniacs
and masturbators,

2224
01:19:22,353 --> 01:19:24,287
watched my wife
seduce a man for dinner,

2225
01:19:24,355 --> 01:19:25,413
threatened with divorce,

2226
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:26,980
arrested for
public urination,

2227
01:19:27,058 --> 01:19:29,959
and drugged by Jacko,
my new prison pal.

2228
01:19:30,028 --> 01:19:31,586
I have a house,
and a mortgage,

2229
01:19:31,663 --> 01:19:34,097
and a son in college,
and a daughter in the theater.

2230
01:19:34,165 --> 01:19:36,633
And I'm one of those nice,
quiet Midwestern guys

2231
01:19:36,701 --> 01:19:38,498
that no one expects to snap,

2232
01:19:38,569 --> 01:19:42,335
but when we do,
watch it, baby!

2233
01:19:42,407 --> 01:19:43,669
Come on in.
Meet the team.

2234
01:19:43,741 --> 01:19:46,676
Bill, Rita, David, Michael,
this is Henry Clark,

2235
01:19:46,744 --> 01:19:49,338
formerly of Sellinski
Advertising in Ohio.

2236
01:19:49,414 --> 01:19:50,403
Hi. How are you?

2237
01:19:50,481 --> 01:19:52,073
He was scheduled
for 9:00.

2238
01:19:52,150 --> 01:19:54,846
9:00, huh? Still on
Central Standard Time?

2239
01:19:54,919 --> 01:19:56,910
Well, actually, Ohio
is Eastern Standard Time.

2240
01:19:56,988 --> 01:19:58,683
A lot of people think
it's Central, but it's not.

2241
01:20:00,291 --> 01:20:01,383
Although Central
Standard Time

2242
01:20:01,459 --> 01:20:02,892
is a very, very
good time zone.

2243
01:20:02,961 --> 01:20:05,953
It's just... It's not too early,
it's not too late.

2244
01:20:07,065 --> 01:20:10,831
It's... It’s just central.

2245
01:20:10,902 --> 01:20:13,097
I don't get the joke.

2246
01:20:14,972 --> 01:20:16,769
[Crying]

2247
01:20:21,979 --> 01:20:24,447
Mr. Clark, your portfolio
is terrific.

2248
01:20:24,515 --> 01:20:26,710
But in an hour, we have
to pitch a follow-up

2249
01:20:26,784 --> 01:20:27,773
to the "I Love
New York" campaign,

2250
01:20:27,852 --> 01:20:29,581
and we're having
big problems.

2251
01:20:29,653 --> 01:20:30,984
I wish our timing
had been better,

2252
01:20:31,055 --> 01:20:34,286
but thanks for coming up
and good luck.

2253
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:38,059
Oh.

2254
01:20:42,032 --> 01:20:43,397
Thank you.

2255
01:20:54,945 --> 01:20:58,073
I think we should start
with New York, New York,

2256
01:20:58,148 --> 01:21:00,548
and then pull back...

2257
01:21:00,618 --> 01:21:02,813
'cause that way,
it's definitely a start.

2258
01:21:02,887 --> 01:21:04,946
It's big. It's bold.
I see that...

2259
01:21:05,022 --> 01:21:07,286
Do you know what
your problem is?

2260
01:21:08,626 --> 01:21:09,718
What did you say?

2261
01:21:09,793 --> 01:21:13,889
I said, "Do you know
what your problem is?"

2262
01:21:13,964 --> 01:21:16,228
No. What's my problem?

2263
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:18,097
You live here.

2264
01:21:18,168 --> 01:21:19,260
You're jaded.

2265
01:21:19,336 --> 01:21:21,702
What you need is
a fresh perspective

2266
01:21:21,772 --> 01:21:26,937
from an outsider
from, say, O... hio.

2267
01:21:27,011 --> 01:21:28,273
Because you
have forgotten

2268
01:21:28,345 --> 01:21:30,575
just how amazing
this city is.

2269
01:21:30,648 --> 01:21:32,980
I have had more
experiences in this city

2270
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:34,449
than many people
who have lived here

2271
01:21:34,518 --> 01:21:35,485
their whole lives.

2272
01:21:35,552 --> 01:21:37,986
I mean, I met
colorful characters.

2273
01:21:38,055 --> 01:21:40,046
I've taken
a breathtaking cab ride

2274
01:21:40,124 --> 01:21:41,455
through Central Park.

2275
01:21:41,525 --> 01:21:44,790
I climbed to the top
of a luxury hotel.

2276
01:21:44,862 --> 01:21:46,386
Not in the elevator,

2277
01:21:46,463 --> 01:21:50,024
actually on the hotel.

2278
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:53,763
And then, I fell...

2279
01:21:53,837 --> 01:21:57,136
in love with my wife
all over again

2280
01:21:57,207 --> 01:21:58,765
at Tavern on the Green,

2281
01:21:58,842 --> 01:22:02,471
on the actual green
itself.

2282
01:22:02,546 --> 01:22:06,004
And... And then I had sex
in front of the mayor.

2283
01:22:06,083 --> 01:22:07,812
I mean, where else

2284
01:22:07,885 --> 01:22:10,115
can something
like this happen?

2285
01:22:10,187 --> 01:22:12,849
Only in New York!

2286
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:21,721
What did you just say?

2287
01:22:21,799 --> 01:22:23,790
You mean the whole thing

2288
01:22:23,867 --> 01:22:25,164
or the tag line
for your new campaign...

2289
01:22:25,235 --> 01:22:26,167
"Only in New York"?

2290
01:22:26,236 --> 01:22:27,464
Which, incidentally,
I copyrighted

2291
01:22:27,538 --> 01:22:28,766
just before
I came up here,

2292
01:22:28,839 --> 01:22:30,670
along with the visual
of the Statue of Liberty

2293
01:22:30,741 --> 01:22:33,710
giving the high five
to a family of tourists.

2294
01:22:33,777 --> 01:22:36,371
Oh, this guy's very good.

2295
01:22:36,447 --> 01:22:38,108
Can I have a doughnut?

2296
01:22:39,183 --> 01:22:40,582
Now, when
the princess arrives,

2297
01:22:40,651 --> 01:22:43,051
try not to be alarmed
by her appearance,

2298
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,644
which is hideous.

2299
01:22:44,722 --> 01:22:46,690
Now do you have all
the Clarks' luggage?

2300
01:22:46,757 --> 01:22:48,190
I think there's also
a garment bag.

2301
01:22:48,258 --> 01:22:49,691
Well, if it's not
here in 60 seconds,

2302
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,227
I shall instruct
the hotel nurse

2303
01:22:51,295 --> 01:22:54,696
to give you
a lethal injection.

2304
01:22:54,765 --> 01:22:56,858
Mrs. Clark,
good afternoon!

2305
01:22:56,934 --> 01:22:58,663
Your yellow chariot awaits,

2306
01:22:58,736 --> 01:23:00,499
and you have
a glorious day for flying.

2307
01:23:00,571 --> 01:23:01,663
Up, up, and away.

2308
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:02,728
Oh, barf.

2309
01:23:02,806 --> 01:23:04,797
Ha ha ha.
My sentiments exactly.

2310
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:06,740
If you see my husband,
would you do me a favor

2311
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:07,834
and give him
that ticket, please?

2312
01:23:07,911 --> 01:23:08,969
But, of course.
Such a good idea

2313
01:23:09,046 --> 01:23:10,377
to get a head start
to the airport.

2314
01:23:10,447 --> 01:23:11,471
Visit those fine shops.

2315
01:23:11,548 --> 01:23:12,640
Get to know
a Hare Krishna, perhaps.

2316
01:23:12,716 --> 01:23:14,240
Close the door,
please.

2317
01:23:14,318 --> 01:23:16,218
Hey! Hey, baby, hey.

2318
01:23:16,286 --> 01:23:17,913
Hold it. Hold it. Hey!

2319
01:23:17,988 --> 01:23:19,216
Hey, baby, baby,
don't go!

2320
01:23:19,289 --> 01:23:20,586
Go! Go! Go!

2321
01:23:20,657 --> 01:23:22,215
Don't go! Don't go!
Don't go! Don't go!

2322
01:23:22,292 --> 01:23:24,886
Don't go! Don't go!
Hey, hey!

2323
01:23:24,962 --> 01:23:26,088
Come here!
Come here!

2324
01:23:26,163 --> 01:23:27,095
Henry!

2325
01:23:27,164 --> 01:23:28,358
Come here! Come here!

2326
01:23:28,432 --> 01:23:29,626
What... What...
What is it?

2327
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:33,329
Ok. Now this is champagne,
and that is the limousine,

2328
01:23:33,404 --> 01:23:35,770
and this is what
we're celebrating.

2329
01:23:35,839 --> 01:23:36,897
What?

2330
01:23:36,974 --> 01:23:38,908
It's the key to my new office.
I got the job.

2331
01:23:38,976 --> 01:23:39,943
Henry, you got the job!

2332
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:40,942
We're New Yorkers now.

2333
01:23:41,011 --> 01:23:42,376
We're New Yorkers now!

2334
01:23:42,446 --> 01:23:43,378
We're never gonna leave!

2335
01:23:43,447 --> 01:23:44,573
We're never
gonna leave!

2336
01:23:44,648 --> 01:23:46,081
Oh, no.
Please, God, no.

2337
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:48,618
And I got you
something, too.

2338
01:23:48,685 --> 01:23:50,414
Oh, honey...

2339
01:23:50,487 --> 01:23:51,579
you didn't have
to do this.

2340
01:23:51,655 --> 01:23:52,587
I know, I know,
but I did.

2341
01:23:52,656 --> 01:23:53,623
Oh, my...

2342
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:57,057
Oh, you got me
a spare key.

2343
01:23:57,127 --> 01:23:58,651
It's the key
to your office.

2344
01:23:58,729 --> 01:24:01,425
Henry, are you
still high?

2345
01:24:01,498 --> 01:24:03,363
They want me to bring in
my own creative team.

2346
01:24:03,434 --> 01:24:05,561
I can hire anyone I want,
and I want you.

2347
01:24:05,636 --> 01:24:07,797
I want my partner back.

2348
01:24:07,871 --> 01:24:08,803
Oh, Henry.

2349
01:24:08,872 --> 01:24:10,134
I mean, all the
best things in my life

2350
01:24:10,207 --> 01:24:11,231
have happened
because of you...

2351
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:13,538
the marriage
and the kids and work.

2352
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:15,009
And this is
how I'm happiest.

2353
01:24:15,079 --> 01:24:16,910
This is crazy!

2354
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:18,811
No, no, no, no,
this makes sense.

2355
01:24:18,882 --> 01:24:20,474
You want to know what my
version of marrow-sucking is?

2356
01:24:20,551 --> 01:24:21,575
What?

2357
01:24:21,652 --> 01:24:24,086
It's being with you.

2358
01:24:24,154 --> 01:24:25,644
That's how I suck.

2359
01:24:25,722 --> 01:24:27,280
Oh, Henry.

2360
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:33,956
[Sighs]

2361
01:24:34,031 --> 01:24:35,225
What's it pay?

2362
01:24:35,299 --> 01:24:36,596
Excuse me...

2363
01:24:36,667 --> 01:24:38,191
are you going to
the airport or not?

2364
01:24:38,268 --> 01:24:39,667
Why? We live here.

2365
01:24:39,736 --> 01:24:40,896
Oh!

2366
01:24:44,308 --> 01:24:45,673
Only in New York.

2367
01:24:47,611 --> 01:24:51,604
So, I take it you won't
be checking out today.

2368
01:24:51,682 --> 01:24:54,446
Or perhaps ever.

2369
01:24:54,518 --> 01:24:56,713
Barry, get the bags.

2370
01:24:56,787 --> 01:24:57,719
Bags!

2371
01:24:57,788 --> 01:24:58,720
What?

2372
01:24:58,789 --> 01:24:59,721
- The bags!
- Where are they?

2373
01:24:59,790 --> 01:25:00,722
They're in the cab!

2374
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:01,723
In the cab?!

2375
01:25:01,792 --> 01:25:04,022
My God...

2376
01:25:04,094 --> 01:25:06,494
I think I'm beginning
to like them.

2377
01:25:06,563 --> 01:25:07,860
Taxi!

2378
01:25:07,931 --> 01:25:11,367
Why do they paint
them all yellow?

2379
01:25:25,449 --> 01:25:26,416
Congratulations.

2380
01:25:26,483 --> 01:25:27,677
She's good,
isn't she?

2381
01:25:27,751 --> 01:25:29,480
You should be proud.

2382
01:25:29,553 --> 01:25:31,384
Isn't the theater magical?

2383
01:25:31,455 --> 01:25:32,444
What?

2384
01:25:32,523 --> 01:25:34,320
Are those my earrings?

2385
01:25:34,391 --> 01:25:37,485
Bravo! Bravo!

2386
01:26:55,005 --> 01:26:59,203
<i>Isn't it romantic?</i>

2387
01:26:59,276 --> 01:27:02,040
<i>Music in the night</i>

2388
01:27:02,112 --> 01:27:06,913
<i>A dream that
can be heard</i>

2389
01:27:06,984 --> 01:27:11,478

01:27:11,555 --> 01:27:14,046

01:27:23,433 --> 01:27:26,402
<i>Hear the breezes playin'</i>

2394
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:32,409
<i>In the trees above</i>

2395
01:27:32,476 --> 01:27:35,240
<i>While</i>

2396
01:27:35,312 --> 01:27:38,338
<i>While all the world
is sayin'</i>

2397
01:27:38,415 --> 01:27:42,943
<i>You were meant for love</i>

2398

01:27:46,290 --> 01:27:50,021

<i>Oh, every note

01:28:02,105 --> 01:28:08,271
<i>Is like a lover's kiss</i>
