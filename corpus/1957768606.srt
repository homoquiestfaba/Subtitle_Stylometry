1
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,935
Ring announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,812
from Jersey city,
New Jersey,

3
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,481
it's the local attraction

4
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:26,026
that you've all
been waiting for.

5
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,194
( Bell dings )

6
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,112
( Crowd cheering )

7
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,327
Announcer: Now,
I just love this story--

8
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,204
the prosecutor
vs. The cop.

9
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,998
The two senseis both have
competing m.M.A. Schools

10
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,375
in the same
New Jersey town.

11
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,252
Two of their students--
Felix Sanchez,

12
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:45,837
who has already fought and won
in five professional fights,

13
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,714
and Anthony Rodriguez--
check it out--

14
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,634
an autistic savant who fights
with magic from within.

15
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,974
( Crowd cheering )

16
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,934
Announcer: Watch out.
He's in trouble here.

17
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,102
Announcer #2:
I think so.

18
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,827
Judge, I want
to object,

19
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,453
but it's more
that I'm confused.

20
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,038
Could you instruct
Mr. Carroll

21
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,249
to stop staring
at my client?

22
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,668
Judge:
Mr. Carroll.
Mr. Carroll,

23
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,962
are we going to continue?

24
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,383
He's the guy...

25
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:35,053
He's the guy you saw
bludgeoning the victim

26
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,222
when you arrived
at the party?

27
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,349
Man":
"Bludgeoning"?
No, not bludgeoning.

28
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,768
He was punching
the one kid who was
punching him back.

29
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,229
Please let the court reflect
that officer tantino just
identified the defendant.

30
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,356
So reflected.

31
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,233
So let me get
this straight:

32
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,485
When you arrived
at the party,
you and sgt. Randinski

33
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,530
had to physically
separate pello
from the victim?

34
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,491
Yeah, I had to grab one kid,
and sgt. Randinski grabbed
the other kid.

35
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,328
They weren't locked
in mortal combat,
fighting to the death.

36
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,289
These are two young kids
that had a little--
thank you.

37
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,750
No further questions,
officer.

38
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,003
You're really exaggerating
what happened here,
counselor.

39
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,213
I said,
no more questions.

40
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,216
Officer, you can't
just offer statements
on your own.

41
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,760
That means you're done.

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,262
You don't make speeches.
You understand?

43
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,891
Judge:
But of course.

44
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,352
Now the defense can
cross-examine you.
Miss Rodriguez.

45
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,439
So, officer tantino,

46
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,816
you seem to have
more testimony.

47
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,152
What exactly
did happen?

48
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,197
We didn't make any arrests,
and no complaints were signed,

49
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:39,117
but the victim in this case
decided to pursue
the matter in court

50
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,536
after speaking
to Mr. Carroll here,
who I believe

51
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,831
is not only the
prosecutor but is also
his martial arts sensei.

52
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,209
I object, your honor.

53
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,919
I guess since he didn't
train his student well enough
to defend himself--

54
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,003
I object!

55
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,756
( All talking at once )

56
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,175
What are you
looking for, counselor?

57
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,969
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Enjoy.

58
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,263
So three guys
are at a party

59
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,766
arguing about who's
got the best memory.

60
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,476
God help me.
First guy says,

61
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,646
"I remember my mother
putting on my diaper."

62
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,732
Second guy says,
"I remember being born."

63
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,110
Third guy says,
"that's nothing.

64
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,986
"I remember
going to a party
with my father

65
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,406
and coming home
with my mother."

66
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,908
( Man laughing )

67
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,244
You know--

68
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:25,372
oh, god.
That's almost
as funny as,

69
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,250
"why did the pothead
cross the road"?

70
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,877
Who else would
follow a chicken?

71
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,421
( Cell phone rings )

72
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,257
Hang on.
Yeah, detective toney.

73
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,676
Right.

74
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,928
Right. Gotcha.
Thank you.

75
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,805
Woods is on
his way to the barn,

76
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,974
and Nick is on
his way after him.

77
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,977
We're off
like a prom dress.

78
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,770
Oh, please. God,
you're so terrible.

79
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,272
Just come with me.

80
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,490
Hey-hey.
Corned-beef special
today, Nick?

81
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,367
No, I'm not here
for lunch today.
Oh.

82
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,203
You're here for Bobby?
That scumbag's
inside, right?

83
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,080
Ah, here we go.

84
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,665
Hey, baby.
How's it goin'?

85
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,002
Bobby woods.
Got a warrant
for your arrest.

86
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,421
Looks like
possession
of cocaine

87
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,215
with the intent
to distribute.
That's ugly.

88
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,009
Turn around,
put your hands
behind your back.

89
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,219
Sure, Nick.

90
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,305
Don't move.

91
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,392
( Siren wailing )

92
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,235
What?
Drop the goddamn knife!

93
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,406
Don't do it,
Bobby!

94
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,201
Just relax.
Don't hurt her.

95
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,830
You never could fight
like a man, could you?

96
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,749
<i> ( Bones snap )</i>
<i> ( Bobby screams )</i>

97
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:57,839
What is the greatest
American pastime?

98
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,466
Is it hockey?

99
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,092
Men:
No, sensei!

100
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,803
Is it soccer?

101
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,555
No, sensei!

102
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,350
Is it even football?
No, sensei!

103
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,394
What is the greatest
American pastime, frank?

104
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,147
Baseball, sensei!

105
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,565
That's right.

106
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,446
And why is it
baseball, Megan?

107
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,657
Its statistics,
sensei!

108
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,701
That's right.
Its statistics.

109
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,122
Stat!
70 home runs, sensei!

110
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,791
Stat!
150 rbi, sensei!

111
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,544
Stat!
300 strikeouts, sensei!

112
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,046
30 wins, sensei!
Stat!

113
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,298
.400 batting average,
sensei!

114
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,843
And is this
a game?

115
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,805
No, sensei.

116
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,307
Is what we do here
a pastime?

117
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,560
All:
No, sensei!
This is real!

118
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,562
It's our way
of life!

119
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,481
And you know what happens
when you don't properly train?

120
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,070
( Coughing )

121
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,197
This could happen
to you at a party,

122
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,199
this could happen
to you at a bar,
on the street.

123
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,368
Man, get this
little girl
off my mat.

124
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,998
Class, hut!

125
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,295
Dan, Felix, contact.

126
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,725
All right, now,
don't start.

127
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,185
I'm not even
gonna ask,

128
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,479
but it couldn't
have happened to
a more liberal judge.

129
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,148
( Muffled curse )

130
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,525
Officer tantino!
Chief's looking for you.

131
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,111
Officer tantino,
Sandra chilton.

132
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,780
I represent
judge demitro.

133
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,782
What can I do for you,
miss chilton?

134
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,784
Don't you think it's
a tad disrespectful,

135
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,661
arresting the judge
in his robes?

136
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,455
"Disrespectful"?
I let him put it on.

137
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,291
I don't understand.

138
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,376
The only thing
the judge was wearing
when I found him

139
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,629
was that gag
in his mouth
and nothing else.

140
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,131
Oh, now, that is
ridiculous.
( Muffled exclamations )

141
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,967
You got something
to say, judge?

142
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,512
The state supreme court
has put our free speech
rights in jeopardy.

143
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,514
I've done all
that I can
in the courtroom.

144
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,850
Now I'm taking it
to the streets.

145
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,019
Gagged and naked
is how they have
left US,

146
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,189
so gagged and naked
is how I will be.

147
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,900
Officer, put that gag
back in my mouth.
Oh, judge.

148
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,610
( Chuckles )
And besides,

149
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,403
I'm the most
muscular judge
on the planet.

150
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,530
Have you seen
the size of my arms
or my chest?

151
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,366
And everything else--
all right,
that's enough.

152
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,076
I don't want to hear--
let's go.

153
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,036
Hey.
Hey. Chief
wants you, Nick.

154
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,955
Yeah, yeah.
The chief is livid
about this arrest.

155
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,707
Man:
<i> Why is it that</i>
<i> you have to get</i>

156
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,669
suspended so many times?

157
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,254
I'm being suspended
for speaking
the truth in court?

158
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,423
How about
Zane carroll, Nick?

159
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,509
Why do you want to
embarrass this guy?

160
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,094
He's part of our team.

161
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,596
He's a dangerous person.

162
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,683
He's a powerful
person, Nick.

163
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,102
Do you have any idea
how badly I'd like to
kick his ass?

164
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,605
You couldn't.

165
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,400
( Scoffs )
Yeah, sure.

166
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,613
Zane carroll wants
your head in a basket.

167
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,241
I'm not gonna give it
to him, of course,

168
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,535
because...
You're my boy.

169
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,248
Thank you.
Don't thank me yet.

170
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,250
I have a new
assignment for you.

171
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,001
A little change
of scenery, Nick--

172
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,839
at the high school.

173
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,926
So, how much
can you bench press?

174
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,553
Really?

175
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,930
Girl:
Come on.
What do you bench?

176
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,186
Hmm.

177
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,898
I would say...
300 pounds?
Yeah.

178
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,318
Girl: So if you had to pick
one of these kids who'd become
a murderer, who would it be?

179
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,196
I don't know.
Shouldn't you be doing
something about that?

180
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,323
Is it my job
to stop them?

181
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,492
I don't think so.

182
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,830
( Whistle blows )

183
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,124
( Shouting )

184
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,418
Face off again!

185
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,839
So what's
your job here?

186
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,841
I have no idea.

187
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,926
( Bell ringing )

188
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,520
Woman:
Anybody tell me who are
some of the major players

189
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,482
in the courtroom
in the criminal
justice system?

190
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,362
It could be a man
or a woman

191
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,615
who sits
at the bench.

192
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:39,412
Come on, guys.
He's the one who makes
all the decisions.

193
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,789
He's the judge.

194
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,707
Right.

195
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,459
I know because my mom
just paid him

196
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,503
a lot of fines
for drunk driving.
( Students laughing )

197
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,380
Thank you, Juan.
I think that's more
than we need to know.

198
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,383
Oh, yeah.
There's also a lot
of pigs in the court too.

199
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,011
I think the men
and women in blue
have a more proper name.

200
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,888
Police officers.

201
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,557
Woman:
Yes. I think what
Juan meant to say

202
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,352
was "police officers."

203
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,895
Now, Anthony,

204
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:07,106
I bet that you know
a lot about the courtroom,

205
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,192
with your sister
being a lawyer.

206
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,569
Man:
Anthony, can you
help US out?

207
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:17,575
I'll bet you
she's in the court
all the time, right?

208
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,161
Cassie is
a defense attorney.

209
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:24,624
Anthony, do you want
to try and tell US what
she does in the courtroom?

210
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,586
He's not gonna answer you,
miss gause. He never does.
Okay.

211
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,797
We all might be
a little slow in here,
but Anthony,

212
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,217
that's a real moron.
( Students laughing )

213
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,387
Hey, we don't like
new kids in our school.

214
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,639
Especially
real stupid ones
that don't talk!

215
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,558
Get up and go to
the vice-principal's office.

216
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,226
What, are you taking
the dummy's side,
miss gause?

217
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,061
Man:
That's enough, Juan.
Let's go.

218
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,188
I don't want to be here.
Leave.

219
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,023
Excuse me.
Get out.

220
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,276
I hope you enjoy
your last few moments
here alone, Nick.

221
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,069
You obviously
have a point.

222
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,113
Why don't you
make it?

223
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,115
I'm buying this school.

224
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,075
I outbid you.

225
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,453
Man:
How do you get
a fat girl in bed?

226
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,750
Piece of cake.

227
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,669
( Laughing )
Good one, Dutch.

228
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,880
You and I, we're
under contract, right?

229
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,925
Yes, we are.
No, no, no.
That's for the building.

230
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,177
Stevie ray, he owns
the martial arts school.

231
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:03,014
And I just offered him
ten more large than
Nicky boy here.

232
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,183
You know what
a crying shame is?

233
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,728
A crying shame is
a busload of lawyers
gone over a cliff...

234
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,146
Both:
With two empty seats.

235
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,981
Yeah, I've never
heard that one before.

236
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,984
Don't pretend you got
a sense of humor.

237
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,779
Stevie's been
bullshitting you,
Mr. Prosecutor.

238
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,615
I've got a lien
on the school

239
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,075
for failure
to pay rent.

240
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,619
And the sale
of the hawthorne institute

241
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,913
of martial arts
goes to...

242
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,832
Drum roll...
( Imitates drum roll )

243
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,961
Nick tantino.

244
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,007
Carroll:
We'll see
about that.

245
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,718
Maybe in court.
Yeah, maybe.

246
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,554
Hey, we can settle this now.
Step on the mat, counselor.

247
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,265
Now, now, don't.

248
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,646
Okay, guys.

249
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,531
Appreciate you
having my back.

250
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,741
Means a lot.
Thanks.

251
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,036
Don't thank me,
pay me.

252
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,913
You got it.

253
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,462
Miss gause,
I'm Cassie Rodriguez.

254
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,965
Please,
have a seat.

255
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,387
Thank you.

256
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,764
You settling into
New Jersey life
all right?

257
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,683
Must be a huge adjustment

258
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,601
after living
your whole life
in Florida.

259
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,895
Oh, no.
Not my whole life.

260
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:37,108
Uh, Anthony and I
were actually both
born in Manhattan.

261
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:41,112
Then after
my parents died,

262
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,197
we moved to tampa.

263
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,824
We lived with
our grandmother,

264
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,660
and then
unfortunately
she passed

265
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,787
when I was just 19,
so it's just been

266
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,873
Anthony and I
ever since then.

267
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,208
Well, I had no idea.
I'm really sorry.

268
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,169
Oh, thank you.

269
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,839
So how's Anthony doing?

270
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,758
Well, I'm very glad
we're having this meeting,

271
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,094
because I do have
some serious concerns.
Okay.

272
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,638
He hasn't connected
with anyone.

273
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,390
Not me;

274
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,852
not my aide, Mr. Watson;
Not a single student.

275
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,021
Well, he just
needs more time,

276
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,482
and then he'll warm up
to a few students.

277
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:21,027
Well, we haven't seen
even the slightest
indication of that yet.

278
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,905
I have yet to receive

279
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,491
much information from
his previous high school,

280
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,786
but, uh, I see here
that his diagnosis

281
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,246
is autism,
not asperger's.

282
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:36,667
No. Doctors have said
that he showed some
signs of asperger's,

283
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,629
like high intelligence--
I'm sure you've seen that
in his schoolwork.

284
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,257
Yes. The high intelligence
is very evident
from his tests.

285
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,885
And honestly, that's...

286
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,931
That's the main reason
I have yet to refer him to
an alternative school setting.

287
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,683
No. He doesn't need
an alternative school setting.

288
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,812
This is the right
place for him.
Trust me on this.

289
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,481
At home, he's
very organized,

290
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,275
and he knows exactly
what he needs to do
for your class.

291
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,946
He speaks to me in full
sentences the majority
of the time.

292
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:09,033
He will talk to you.
He will communicate
with you.

293
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,911
He just needs
a little bit more time.

294
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,622
Well, it's...
It's obvious

295
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,083
that you know your brother
better than anybody here.

296
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,046
I will give him
a little more time--

297
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,965
say, a month or so.

298
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:27,468
But we really do
need to see some
social progress.

299
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,138
At minimum,
some more
communication.

300
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,890
Thank you,
miss gause.

301
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,685
I really
appreciate it.

302
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,271
And I'd be
more than happy
to be a guest speaker.

303
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,898
Oh, that would
be great.

304
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,609
Yes, I think that
that would really help
motivate Anthony.

305
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,611
Yes, I do too.

306
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,780
Thank you.

307
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,204
And the capital
of Maine is...
Augusta.

308
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,290
Right. Vermont.
Montpelier.

309
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,542
Good.
The capital of
New Hampshire is Concord.

310
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,836
The capital of Connecticut
is Hartford. The capital of
Rhode Island is Providence.

311
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,005
New York, Albany;
New Jersey; Trenton;
Very good. Keep going.

312
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,174
The capital of Delaware
is Dover; The capital of
Maryland is Annapolis.

313
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,467
See, Anthony?
This is what you
need to do at school:

314
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,428
Speak to people
in complete sentences.

315
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,430
Do you think you can
try and do that?

316
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,224
I'm hungry.
What's for dinner?

317
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,729
( Rap music plays )

318
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,629
Hello, Nicholas.

319
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,339
Hey, Jill.

320
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,635
So, this is
the place.

321
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,512
Yeah, this is it.
Want me to
give you a tour?

322
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,224
Sure.

323
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,976
This is
the weight room.

324
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:02,730
I can see that.

325
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,360
This is the women's
change room--
lockers and showers.

326
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,988
You look good.
Thank you.
So do you.

327
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,199
This is the men's room.

328
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,118
Got some sweaty,
athletic guys
hanging out in there.

329
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,287
I can see you spending
some time in there.

330
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,331
Not funny, Nick.

331
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,125
Oh, and back there is
just an unfinished area.

332
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,961
I'm still
working on it.

333
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,879
What are you gonna
do with it?

334
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,631
I'm gonna finish it.

335
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,508
Come on. Can't wait
to show you this.

336
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,552
This...

337
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,181
This is the main
fight room.

338
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,600
It's where it's all
gonna go down.

339
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,980
Pretty nice,
right?

340
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,898
It's a palace.

341
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:50,027
Palace for you,
Nicholas.

342
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,032
Jill, this is
what I want.

343
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,618
This... this is
what I need.

344
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,622
What you need
is to support me,
your wife,

345
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,125
and not spend
our entire savings
on a midlife crisis.

346
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,045
How many students
do you have?

347
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,047
It's not about
students right now.

348
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,258
It's about having
a place to train,

349
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,761
get back into shape,
and fight professionally again.

350
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,640
Nick, that was
15 years ago.

351
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,269
And are you kidding me?
This entire place
for just you?

352
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,354
Jill, you know what?
I've had enough.

353
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:29,483
I can't stand my job.
I don't want to be
a cop anymore.

354
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,737
They've got me
babysitting kids
in the high school.

355
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,156
I just
want to fight.

356
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,075
I'm not going down
with you, Nick.

357
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,704
I've stood by you
through all your
suspensions,

358
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,290
all your violence.

359
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,835
Yeah, you've been
a gentleman to me,

360
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:51,839
but all your violence...

361
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,508
And that one time
long ago--

362
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,053
how many women
would've stood
by you for that?

363
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,265
No more. You've got
a shower here. Move in.

364
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,017
This is
your new home.

365
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,272
I came here hoping
that I wouldn't

366
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,358
have to give you this.

367
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,117
It's over, Nick.

368
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,042
Funny how you
don't fight this.

369
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,133
Anthony:
Food? Food? Food? Food? Food?

370
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,178
Food? Food? Food?
Food? Food?

371
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,397
Anthony, you have to
get along at school.

372
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,607
You have to
participate.

373
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:59,323
( Sighs ) Miss gause
called my office. She wants
me to be a guest speaker.

374
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,619
Guest speaker, good.
You will be a good
guest speaker.

375
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,168
Anthony, they don't
know about your past

376
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,379
and what happened
in Florida.

377
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,101
Boy:
I wanna see it.
I wanna see it.

378
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,103
( Chattering )

379
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,445
Hold on.
Yeah, I'm tubby,

380
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,447
but that's the dummy.

381
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:44,076
Yeah, you are one
moronic son of a bitch,
aren't you?

382
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,911
Yo.

383
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,997
This'll wake you
from your sleep.

384
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,836
( Spanish )

385
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,638
Hey.

386
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,724
Hey, get off him!
( Blows whistle )

387
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,314
Hey.

388
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:16,233
Calm down.

389
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,319
Relax. It's okay.

390
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,949
This is where it happened,
over by this basket.

391
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,785
Really, I've never seen
anything quite like it
before.

392
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:30,080
So athletic, but brutal.

393
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,959
He's autistic?
Yes, but he's
not brutal.

394
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,962
Miss Rodriguez,
when we spoke,

395
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,758
you didn't tell me
about Anthony's past,
but today our principal did.

396
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,427
I have Anthony's files
from south tampa high school.

397
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,305
Ninth and tenth grades.

398
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,559
Seven fights,
four suspensions,
one expulsion.

399
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,063
Eleventh grade--
well, half of it--

400
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,273
three broken ribs,
one broken nose,

401
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,692
and several stitches--

402
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,612
mind you, that with
three different boys.

403
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,697
Now, here's
my favorite:

404
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,699
The balance of
eleventh grade

405
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,953
and one month
of twelfth grade
at St. Joe's--

406
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:12,748
14 fights. I--

407
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,209
you don't have to say
anything else, Dr. Conci.

408
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,336
Priests and nuns

409
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,589
perhaps have
a little bit more Patience
with their students,

410
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:25,553
maybe because they have
a certain higher calling
they're beholden to.

411
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:28,264
As principal of
a public high school,

412
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,267
I have a different
higher calling
to deal with:

413
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,686
A superintendent
and a board
of education.

414
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:36,146
And they're worried
about things like
getting sued.

415
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,190
I could definitely see
a lawsuit here.

416
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,317
He mercilessly beat
Felix and Juan.

417
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,027
No provocation.

418
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,071
Excuse me.
That's not accurate.

419
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,492
You were there,
and you know it didn't
happen that way.

420
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,538
Look, both of these kids
were teasing Anthony

421
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,708
almost to the point
of harassment,
and the one kid, Felix,

422
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,127
he whipped the ball
at Anthony's chest
from point-blank range

423
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,878
and then he put
his hands on him.

424
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,881
This is the kind of thing
that's happened before.

425
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:06,010
Look, Anthony
gets provoked.

426
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,262
It seems so this time,

427
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:11,724
based on what
officer tantino witnessed,

428
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:16,228
but all his prior schools
seem to describe
a ticking time bomb.

429
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:20,357
And we've discussed
his antisocial behavior.

430
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,359
With this new development,
I really think that

431
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,028
he needs to go to
an alternative school
setting.

432
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,112
No.
I'm sorry.

433
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,323
Look, he's already in

434
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:30,534
a special ed class,
and I really don't want him
any more labeled.

435
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,037
I'm sorry, Ms. Rodriguez,

436
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,663
but his past is so
very, very troubling.

437
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,665
Look, Dr. Conci,

438
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,209
what if I was personally
responsible for Anthony?

439
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,211
What?
What?

440
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,173
I'm here as the school
resource officer.

441
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,342
I'm supposed to be
teaching kids.

442
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,510
What if I focus all
my energy and concentrate
on just one student?

443
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,638
I'm a veteran
police officer

444
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,181
and a seasoned
black belt.

445
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,183
I know I could
help that kid curb
his violence.

446
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,976
I could help him
control it

447
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,063
and maybe even find out
what causes it.

448
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:02,024
Okay, I'm sure if
he was under your
constant supervision,

449
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,610
you could protect
the other students,

450
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,404
but you don't have
any education or experience

451
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,282
working with autistic
children, do you?

452
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,868
You're right. I don't have
any training or expertise
in autism,

453
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,412
but that kid made
direct eye contact
with me.

454
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,915
That's not usual
with autistic kids.
Am I right?

455
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,959
That's absolutely right.
I've been around
the block a few times,

456
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,253
and I know a few things
about combat.

457
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,715
There was something strange
going on with that kid when
he was fighting those boys,

458
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,760
something that took him
completely out of
his cocoon.

459
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,471
I want the opportunity
to train Anthony.

460
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,640
I know that through
the martial arts, I could
help him cultivate

461
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,725
and develop those
incredible skills
he has.

462
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,354
You not only want US
to keep him in high school,

463
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:42,398
but you want US
to allow you to
teach him

464
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,359
how to fight even more?

465
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,528
Well, yeah.

466
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:50,698
Nick:
I'm gonna teach you
some grappling, Anthony.

467
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:53,075
Now, watch this.

468
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,119
Show him
the arm bar.

469
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,416
Anthony, pay attention.

470
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,046
Ho!

471
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,548
Ho!

472
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,758
I have Glenn's arm,
and if he doesn't tap,

473
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,052
his arm's gonna break.
Okay!

474
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,474
I hope you've
got this kid
on a short leash.

475
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,394
Very short.
It was no small task

476
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,813
convincing
the superintendent.

477
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,941
I don't know, man.
I really want to
help this kid.

478
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,318
We'll show him some kicks.
Get your helmet on.
Come on!

479
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,741
Please, Anthony.

480
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,246
This is the
roundhouse kick.

481
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,374
I got a low kick
to the thigh...
( Exclaims )

482
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,502
Up to the ribs,
nice and high.

483
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,630
Nice head kick, Anthony.
Roundhouse to the head.

484
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,676
( Exclaims )

485
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,512
I'd better see
some results
in 60 days.

486
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,723
Like what?
How should I know?

487
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,142
I don't know anything
about retarded kids.

488
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:03,437
Nick:
I want to teach
you that, man.

489
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,522
You're gonna get it.
Get up.

490
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,277
Anthony--

491
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,029
Anthony.

492
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,822
Anthony!

493
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,575
( Exclaims )

494
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,380
You know, I really
love you guys.

495
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,217
You're not just
my students,

496
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,636
you're my family.

497
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:39,139
And I really feel like
I'm letting you down.

498
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,183
I mean,

499
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,560
is it me

500
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,021
or is it you?

501
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:50,692
Riley, you got
your ass kicked
at a party.

502
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,986
Is it me

503
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,489
or is it you?

504
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,991
And the week
before that,

505
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:01,161
Toby, you got
your tooth
knocked out

506
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,205
in a bar fight.

507
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,791
Is it me

508
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,668
or is it you?

509
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:11,171
And Felix...

510
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:15,092
Felix, my prize,

511
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:19,304
my top student,
a brilliant pugilist,

512
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,723
an 18-year-old
high-school senior

513
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,809
who's never lost
a tournament fight--

514
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,895
5 and 0, beat m.M.A. Stars
with years of experience,

515
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,482
and you get your ass
kicked in gym class
by an autistic kid?

516
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,194
So I ask you again,
is it me or is it you?

517
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,114
Is it me
or is it you?

518
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:39,867
It's me! It's me! It's me!

519
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:43,036
It's me! It's me!
It's me! It's me! It's me!

520
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,458
It's me.

521
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,508
( Phone numbers beeping )

522
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,344
( Line ringing )

523
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,513
"What about his father,
( Phone rings )

524
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,308
"A surgeon criminal,
a man responsible

525
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,184
for probably
many deaths?"

526
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,769
( Ringing continues )
So then

527
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,731
why should he worry about
letting his father go?

528
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,650
He couldn't be expected
to do everything right.

529
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,820
He couldn't be loyal
to everything
all at once.

530
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,239
<i> Carroll:</i>
<i> Still teaching that</i>
<i> American literature?</i>

531
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,033
Private lesson,
I'm assuming.

532
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,951
That's the only kind
I do now.

533
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,164
Katerina, can you
give me a minute?

534
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:29,499
Of course,
professor Cooper.

535
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,087
How is, uh,
New Jersey?

536
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,340
<i> I have a problem</i>
<i> in our other world.</i>

537
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,800
There's this--
this cop.

538
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,928
He's gotten so far
under my skin.

539
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,263
<i> I just want to rip</i>
<i> his throat out.</i>
<i> I just want to kill him.</i>

540
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,642
Focus. Streamline.

541
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,644
<i> Think about</i>
<i> what you need.</i>

542
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,229
<i> A cop has been</i>
<i> training this kid,</i>

543
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,816
<i> and he's embarrassed</i>
<i> my most prized student. </i>
Sounds simple.

544
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,819
Well, it's more complicated.
The kid, he's, uh...

545
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,072
<i> He's, like, handicapped.</i>
<i> He's autistic.</i>

546
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:04,368
Do you remember how
I taught you to fight?
Our creed?

547
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:06,954
Not only do I remember it,
sensei, I teach it.

548
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,580
Then live it.

549
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,042
Modify your officer
in every way that you can,

550
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:15,379
in every aspect of his life.
And the student?

551
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,507
You owe your student
your loyalty.

552
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,926
And remember,

553
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,930
you can't be expected
to be loyal to everything
all at once.

554
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,223
( Phone beeps )

555
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,349
Katerina.

556
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:31,061
Yes?
Where were we?

557
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,605
Here.
( Both chuckling )

558
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:36,900
( Line ringing )

559
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,152
Megan, come in here
for a moment, please.

560
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,739
<i> Hello? </i>
Felix,

561
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,826
I want you to come
here before school
tomorrow morning.

562
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:48,245
We're gonna start
a new type of training.

563
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:58,422
I need you to run
a criminal case
history for me.

564
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,923
On who?

565
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,759
Nick tantino.
But he's a cop.

566
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,594
So I'm investigating him.

567
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,263
About what?

568
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,098
Fraud.

569
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:11,018
Falsifying his
law enforcement
job application.

570
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,854
Aren't we a little
past the statute
of limitations?

571
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:16,440
Just listen to me
for a second.

572
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,818
I heard a story about him.
I just want to find out
if it's true.

573
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:24,031
If it is, then lying
on his application will
be the least of his troubles.

574
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:27,701
But it's what I need
to legally investigate him.

575
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:31,580
So you want me to
do this at the office?

576
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,290
Of course.

577
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,543
Where else?

578
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,224
Thank you.

579
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,033
How's Anthony
been doing?

580
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:11,620
Has he been taking
any interest in
the martial arts training?

581
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,289
Not yet.
I can't get him to
say two words to me.

582
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,166
I don't know if he's
absorbing the techniques or--

583
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,585
he's been
talking about you
here at home.

584
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,337
He has? Really?
Yeah.

585
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,631
And for him to talk
about something
so quickly

586
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,674
is unusual.

587
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,968
Anthony, dinner!

588
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:31,765
You know, most
autistic kids

589
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,767
lose a previously
acquired ability

590
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,478
to speak sentences
or even words.

591
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,939
But Anthony?

592
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:42,067
Anthony has actually
progressed.

593
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,111
There's
high-functioning
autism,

594
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,154
sometimes called
p.O.D.-N.O.S.,

595
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,782
and then there's
diagnostic categories,

596
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:53,370
such as Rhett's syndrome
and fragile-x syndrome.

597
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,331
This disorder is
very confusing.

598
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,583
I mean, there are
some autistic kids
that have

599
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,502
the messiest desks
at school,

600
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:04,005
and then there are some
with the neatest ones.

601
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:08,135
But there's one
unifying factor:

602
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:11,388
All have difficulty
communicating

603
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:15,684
and interacting
with others.

604
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,645
Anthony, dinner!

605
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,986
There he is.

606
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,822
Yeah. My brother
sure does

607
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:31,116
communicate when
he wants to,

608
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,869
through aberrational
reflexive
and fighting skills.

609
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,912
How do we figure
this out?

610
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,039
How do we put this
to a positive use?

611
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,795
I think I have somebody
that I can bring
into the fold

612
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,256
that can really help US.
Another martial arts
instructor?

613
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,382
Well, sort of.

614
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,992
Hi. Dr. Reno.

615
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,077
And who the fuck
are you?

616
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,663
Uh, I'm Glenn.

617
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,415
I work for Nick.

618
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:25,212
So he sent some lackey
to pick me up
from the train, hmm?

619
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,088
Uh, can I take
your bags?

620
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,966
Do I look like some kind
of fucking idiot? No.

621
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:33,261
You can't take my bags.
Just take me to Nick.

622
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,513
Come on!
Get your ass moving.

623
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,308
Okay.

624
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,606
Get up,
you lazy bastard!

625
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,111
( Chuckling )
Dr. Reno!

626
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,281
Good to see you, kid.
So, I'm staying here?

627
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,284
Of course not. I got
a nice hotel room
picked out for you.

628
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,662
Hell, no.
I'm staying on site
in this environment.

629
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,331
I just meant,
is this dump my room?

630
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,041
I'll put you in
another dump room.

631
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,709
Don't you know how
to treat a guest?

632
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,545
Pick up my fucking bags.
Take 'em to my room.

633
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,548
Yes, sir.
All right.
Get your ass moving.

634
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,678
Come on, pussy!
Yeah, come on!

635
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:18,056
( Exclaiming )

636
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,392
Kick!
One, two, three--

637
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,481
get up! You're never
gonna fall down
on me again.

638
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,776
Remember, we don't fight fair,
we fight to win. Now, say it!

639
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,028
We don't fight fair,
we don't...
We fight to win!

640
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,990
Zane.

641
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,702
Tantino's rap sheet
is clean.
Shit!

642
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,288
And I felt
really awkward
pulling his file.

643
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:44,124
Is everybody
a pussy here?
Zane...

644
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,084
I'm sorry.

645
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,378
As prosecutors, I know
we have the right
to investigate,

646
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,588
but I'm real unclear
of what we're doing here.

647
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,383
Call it.
Wrestle.

648
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,554
I think he killed
somebody.

649
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:58,847
What?

650
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,767
Like, 20 years ago.

651
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,937
How? When? Where?
How could he be a cop
if he killed somebody?

652
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,064
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.

653
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,235
Give me 50.

654
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,616
Okay, listen to me.
In my office,

655
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,618
there's a promotional
agreement

656
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,662
for a professional bout
in Jersey city.

657
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,832
I want you to extend
that agreement to tantino
and his student.

658
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:29,794
I don't understand.
Do you want to fight
tantino or prosecute him?

659
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,255
Both.

660
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,257
Get out of here.

661
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,302
Come on!
( Clapping hands )

662
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,684
( Growls )

663
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,771
Doc, this is the file
with all Anthony's
information.

664
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,482
Did you forget?
I make my own
observations.

665
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,614
There's nothing in that file
that will help this boy.

666
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:00,575
Right?
You stupid prick!

667
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,744
Dr. Reno, easy.
Huh?

668
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:08,958
( Yells )

669
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,920
Jesus.

670
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,172
I don't know
what's wrong
with this kid.

671
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:18,259
So that's it?
Certainly not,
you buffoon!

672
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,388
We're gonna have to
get down and dirty!

673
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:24,808
Deal with his mind!
Get rough with him!

674
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:27,352
Goddamn it.

675
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,646
Get his sister
down here!

676
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,398
We need her help.

677
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:34,109
You got it.

678
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,278
Woman:
Judge demitro isn't
really nuts, your honor.

679
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,864
You understand that.

680
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,658
That depends how
you look at it.

681
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,868
How so?

682
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,705
Standing naked
in front of his house
is kind of crazy.

683
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,207
Well--
but he was
smart enough

684
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,126
to hire the two
prettiest lawyers in town.

685
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:55,130
We're from
the same firm,
your honor.

686
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,132
Then you have
a smart boss.

687
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,801
I am the boss.

688
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:03,304
Then the charge
will go away?

689
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,557
I mean, it was
his house,

690
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,059
and he thought
he was walking
into the bathroom,

691
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,353
but he accidentally
went out the front door.

692
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,314
Well, I shouldn't
talk about the case
without the prosecutor.

693
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:17,360
But can you
give US a hint?

694
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,404
That judge demitro

695
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,531
sure is a smart man.

696
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,035
Court is adjourned
for today, ladies.

697
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,829
Thank you, judge.
Thank you, your honor.

698
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,583
You know,
30 years back,

699
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,793
I could kick
higher than you

700
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,754
and hit much harder!

701
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,339
Oh, Jesus!

702
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,050
I didn't mean to
make it a challenge.

703
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,802
You know I'd never
hurt you, doc.

704
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,180
Anthony...
That kid's the challenge.

705
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,931
I'm gonna really need
your help with him.

706
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,851
We've got
a challenge for you.

707
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,769
Hey.

708
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,855
Come on in, baby.

709
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,274
Zane carroll's
promoting a bout.

710
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,736
Ten professional fights,
all weight classes.

711
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:03,072
My buddy Zane carroll, huh?
Where's this gonna take place?
Jersey city.

712
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:06,075
And who does he
want to fight?
Is this your student?

713
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:10,163
No, no, no.
I'm the, uh,
teacher, honey.

714
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,749
Aren't you a lawyer
or something?
And a black belt.

715
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:16,211
Wow! Wow!
What a woman. Hey.

716
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,296
Take a swing
at me, baby.
( Chuckling )

717
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,298
Wait a minute.
He wants Anthony
to have

718
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,716
a professional fight
in less than a month?
What is he thinking?

719
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,468
It's against Felix.

720
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,970
He already
knocked him out
in school.

721
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,680
Well, I'll tell him
the offer's rejected.

722
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,099
No, no, no. Hold on.
You got a pen?

723
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,143
I'm only in town
for a few days,

724
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,229
so why don't we have
a little pre-fight?

725
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,022
Who is this guy?
Don't ask him.

726
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,733
He doesn't know how
to treat a lady.

727
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,568
Come by my room.
It's kind of a dump,

728
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,322
but I can show you moves
that you never even heard of.

729
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,200
Hmm?
So it's on?

730
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,952
Give that to Mr. Carroll.

731
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,287
Yeah.
Show me the moves.

732
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,332
I'll see you in,
let's say, an hour?

733
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,418
I'll see you
and your sensei
in Jersey city.

734
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,423
Oh, wow.

735
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:06,386
I wanna do...
Something for you.

736
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,972
Well, I hope
it's something better
than that rhyme.

737
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,266
Oh, it is.
Do it.

738
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:14,394
All right.
Well, it's called
"pushups for love."

739
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,021
What?
Yeah, 'cause
you're a hottie

740
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,982
and I love
your body

741
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,900
and I wanna get
real naughty.

742
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,402
So I do these
pushups, baby--

743
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:25,780
pushups for love.
Yeah.

744
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,657
Can't we just go
get something to eat?

745
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,200
No, I got, like,
three more.

746
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,204
One... pushup... more...
For love.

747
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,206
All right, let's go.

748
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,833
Whoa!

749
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,085
What's brown
and hides
in the attic?

750
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,337
The diarrhea
of Anne frank.

751
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,590
I don't get it.
Yeah, of course
you don't.

752
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,508
'Course not.
( Chuckles )

753
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,427
Come on.
Come on.

754
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,390
Anne who?

755
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,770
Nick:
Really going to town
on that bag, big guy.

756
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,442
Hey, doc,
here's that kid.

757
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,865
Oh! Hey!

758
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:12,577
So, this is
my specimen, huh?

759
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,329
( Chuckles )

760
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,539
( Growls )

761
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,417
Come with me,
my son.

762
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,253
So you're
the smart-ass

763
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,298
who's gonna help me
figure out this
conundrum, hmm?

764
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:27,133
Juan:
What's a "cundrum"?

765
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,053
( Chuckles )
You asshole.

766
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:33,264
What was that?
What's going on?

767
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,184
I'm back to falsely
arresting criminals.

768
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,478
Is that an oxymoron?

769
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,188
Get outta here.

770
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:44,275
Cassie, time out.
I know it looks bad,

771
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,569
but trust me,
it's all under control.

772
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,656
Believe it or not,
this is my team.

773
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:52,241
Cassie, you came!
Cassie, you came!
Yeah.

774
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,535
Let me show you.

775
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,663
Atta boy.
Good job, champ.

776
00:40:56,663 --> 00:41:00,667
Dr. Reno:
Come on, ya grimy
little sea urchin.

777
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,377
Come on.

778
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:10,051
I want you to talk.

779
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,138
I don't know what
you want me to say.

780
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,849
Don't be a wise-ass.

781
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,519
Doc, we don't
need him.

782
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,438
We can do
whatever this is
without him.

783
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,233
You, hit
the bricks!

784
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,151
Hit the bricks!

785
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,153
Oh, come on.
Hit the bricks.

786
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,280
Hit the bricks,
you motherfucker.
Out of here!

787
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,366
It means "leave."
Let's go.

788
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:36,619
I'm Dr. Reno.
Cassie: Are you
a medical doctor?

789
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,163
No, he's a psychiatrist.
One of the best.

790
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,582
The meat-head knows this
from personal experience.

791
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,668
You're Anthony's sister?
Yeah.

792
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,087
This is really unusual.
He doesn't normally
rock like this.

793
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:49,215
That's because he's not
your usual autistic.
I should take him home.

794
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,176
No!
With all due respect,
I don't even know you.

795
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,595
Your brother is a savant!
Stop rubbing his fucking arm.

796
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,223
He's autistic.
He's not an idiot savant.

797
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,933
He's an autistic
savant!

798
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,311
( Spanish )

799
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,943
Calm down!
Calm down!

800
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,320
Just relax.
Shh.

801
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,991
Anthony understands Spanish
with feelings like
any other person.

802
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,201
We don't even
communicate
in Spanish.

803
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,120
He knows it
innately.

804
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,876
<i> Grazie.</i>

805
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,380
Rod carew, 1977 m.V.P.,
American league.

806
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,507
National league 1977
m.V.P., George foster.

807
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,676
Dr. Reno:
<i> An autistic savant</i>
<i> is a person</i>

808
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,970
<i> who has</i>
<i> an exceptional skill.</i>

809
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,222
...1977, when rod carew
won American league m.V.P.

810
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,642
<i> About 10 percent of people</i>
<i> with autism are savants.</i>

811
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,227
...303 batting average.

812
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,481
<i> And the most common are</i>
<i> splinter skills.</i>

813
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,691
<i> This is</i>
<i> a person with a hobby--</i>
<i> maybe great at trivia</i>

814
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,151
<i> like m.V.P.S</i>
<i> and batting averages.</i>

815
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:53,279
...16 at-bats.

816
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,656
And then there are
those very few

817
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:58,493
with prodigious
skills,

818
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:02,705
a person who can play
an entire Mozart concerto

819
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:06,375
on the piano after
hearing it only once.

820
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,711
Or a kid who has

821
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,798
fifth-degree
black belt abilities

822
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:15,510
because he saw
a Bruce Lee movie.

823
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,720
It's believed that
there are less than 25

824
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,807
autistic savants in the world
who hold prodigious skills,

825
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:24,727
and Anthony...
Is one of them.

826
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,396
Even more confounding,
it seems that

827
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:30,316
Anthony has two
savant skills.

828
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,693
The Spanish.
Yes.

829
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,904
Though it's clearly not
a prodigious skill because

830
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,114
he only seems to fully
relate to the language

831
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:40,034
when something
harshly negative
is said to him.

832
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,620
Probably a splinter skill.
But, doc, let me
ask you a question.

833
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,081
How did you figure out
the whole Spanish thing?

834
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:48,125
Can I take your main course?
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

835
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,753
Can't you see
we're talking here?

836
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,214
Get your ass
out of here.

837
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:54,966
So, how did
I figure it out?

838
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:58,302
I asked that punk Juan
how the fight started.

839
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,097
They cursed
at Anthony
in Spanish.

840
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,015
That's it?
You got it
from just that?

841
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,351
No, pencil-head.
I read that thick
file you gave me.

842
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,311
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

843
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,313
Almost every kid
he got into a fight with

844
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,399
had a Spanish
last name.

845
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,526
The one school
he went to had
a very small

846
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:15,778
hispanic population.

847
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,864
That's why he had
only one fight there.

848
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:20,950
But that St. Joe's was
chock-full of latinos.

849
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:24,954
Thus the 14 fights.
This isn't brain
surgery, huh?

850
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,582
So now we have
to get Anthony
to understand Spanish

851
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,584
in all different areas,

852
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,211
not only when
it gets him angry.

853
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,797
Dr. Reno, can you
continue to help US?

854
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,049
No.
Nick: "No"?
What do you mean, doc?

855
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,468
We really need you here.
No, no, no.

856
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,680
He needs practical help.
This isn't a...

857
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,891
A mind that can be
manipulated by
a psychiatrist.

858
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:47,310
You just needed
the right doctor to learn

859
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,770
what the real deal is.

860
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,772
And now you've got to
use that karate room

861
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,400
and the Spanish language
to hone those skills,

862
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,736
and I ain't
gonna be around
when you're calling him

863
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:59,864
a dick head in Spanish.
No way.

864
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:03,784
Where the hell
is the waiter?
I'm hungry!

865
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:10,541
Yeah, that's right.
I'm here at Anthony's
karate school.

866
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,835
Mixed martial arts,
judo, karate, whatever.

867
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,546
It's all
the same thing.

868
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,548
No, the cops didn't
bring me here again.

869
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,092
I came by myself because
I'm gonna kick this kid's ass.

870
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,723
All right, Anthony.
All right, all right.

871
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,475
It's time to
get going.
Come on.

872
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,310
Oh!
( Chuckles )

873
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,063
That was just luck.
I wasn't looking.

874
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:36,025
Well, I guess Felix
wasn't looking either.

875
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:41,405
Elizabeth, shut up.
You're talking a bunch of crap.

876
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,408
I know you were there.
I'm telling you, it was
just dumb luck.

877
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,371
Haven't you ever
seen me box?

878
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:50,498
I'm faster than
Mahatma Gandhi.

879
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,750
Well, that's what I mean.
Muhammad Ali.

880
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,752
And you've seen how many
pushups I can do.

881
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,338
I would've did more if it
wasn't for those stupid cops.

882
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,507
Anyway, I got to go, all right?
And you're gonna eat your words,

883
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,384
'cause I'm gonna
kick his ass.

884
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,806
Hi, Juan.
Hi, Juan.

885
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:10,935
Hi, Juan.
Hi, Juan.
Hi, Juan.

886
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,938
You know,
back in the day,
I could take

887
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,899
those punches and kicks
from that kid.

888
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,609
Better than
I ever could.

889
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,736
Oh, hell, no.
Not better
than you, Nick.

890
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,406
Not too long ago,
you were on your way
to being the best.

891
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:26,993
You let the killing
sidetrack you.

892
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:29,495
You know, doc,
some people are dead.

893
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,580
And deservedly so.
I have no regrets.

894
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,166
Yeah. I agree.
Think about this, Nick:

895
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,878
You became a cop,
not a professional
fighter.

896
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:42,216
Sidetracked you.
But I think now
you're back on track.

897
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,969
Help that kid.
Thanks, doc.
Good to see you.

898
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,971
God bless you, baby.
Stay well.

899
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,432
All right.
I'm out of here.

900
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,517
<i> Arrivederci.</i>

901
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,688
Cassie:
Ladies and gentlemen,

902
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:58,357
today, a message
needs to be sent,

903
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,985
a message
not only heard
in Los Angeles,

904
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,988
Washington D.C.
and New York City,

905
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:07,033
but also right here
in New Jersey--

906
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:09,535
a message to
the police department,

907
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:13,414
to the prosecutor's office
and to the public at large:

908
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:17,126
Stop the corruption.

909
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:19,545
Stop arresting
innocent people

910
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,965
and altogether
ruining their lives.

911
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,885
Stop the power abuse.

912
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:29,138
That's the beginning
of a closing argument.

913
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,766
( Students applauding )

914
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:40,941
Now, here's the important
message that I want to
tell all of you today:

915
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,986
I know that miss gause
told you yesterday
that my brother Anthony

916
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:47,198
has some very rare
and remarkable abilities,

917
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:51,202
but he needs some help
to use these abilities
in a good way.

918
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,412
He needs help
from me,

919
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,915
from officer tantino,
from miss gause

920
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:58,542
and other teachers here
at hawthorne high.

921
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:02,963
He also needs
your help.

922
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,091
Will you help him?

923
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:07,885
Anthony, I'll help you.
Miss gause:
All right. Everyone

924
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,971
clap if you'll help
your friend Anthony.

925
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,182
( All clapping )
Mr. Watson:
Come on, guys. Let's go.

926
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:15,893
I'll try to.
I'm in.

927
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,312
All right.
Juan, what about you?

928
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,397
Oh, come on,
miss gause.

929
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,067
Tell Anthony that
you'll be his friend,

930
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,027
in Spanish.

931
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,154
Miss gause...

932
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,657
All is
forgiven, Juan.

933
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:31,283
Please help.

934
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,546
<i> Yo soy tu amigo.</i>

935
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:50,886

That's very close,
Elizabeth.

939
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,937
No, it's, um,

940
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,941

941
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,152

Hey,<i> Antonio,</i>

947
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,809
Nick--
Nick and Anthony.

948
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,062
Nick and Anthony.
Nick and Anthony.
Nick and Anthony, win.

949
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,527
And that's it.
Basic wrestling move.

950
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,779
It's a good technique.
I want you to learn it.

951
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,239
Uh...

952
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,953
Okay? Yeah.
Try to follow, man.

953
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,955
You can do this.
Come on.

954
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,999
Level change,
drop the knee.

955
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,085
Penetrate, shoot in.
Take somebody
right to the mat.

956
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,672
Level change,
drop the knee,

957
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,217
penetrate,
shoot in!

958
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:13,928
Can you do it,
Anthony?

959
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,721
( Mouthing words )
Nick: Okay.

960
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,474
Uh, tell you what. Um...

961
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,896
Oh, yeah!
Oh, nice!

962
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:26,232
That's what
I'm talking about, kid.
Way to go.

963
00:50:26,232 --> 00:50:28,025
Let's get it on.
Come on! Hup!
Get them hands up.

964
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,526
Ha! Ha! Ha!

965
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,737
Come on.
Ha! Ha! Ha!

966
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,073
Whoa! Easy!

967
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,826
Aah! Easy.

968
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,536
That's it.
High five.

969
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,205
Come on.
Get that upper body.

970
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,832

00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,261

Ha! Move.

988
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:58,157

savant boy, in the cage.

993
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,275
What's the matter?
You don't have the guts to
say it to him in Spanish?

994
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:41,325
Amd that doesn't
even affect you?

995
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:44,286
Why should it?
Herbert hoover was the president
during the great depression.

996
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,288
Say it in Spanish.

997
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,089
Anthony, I just
don't understand.

998
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,556
Was that Felix, my student,
I just saw leave here?

999
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,266
Yes, and he was just
threatening my brother.

1000
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,727
So this is Anthony.
Yes.

1001
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,729
Look, I'm really
sorry about Felix.

1002
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,689
I had a feeling
he was gonna
head down here.

1003
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,900
I'm gonna straighten him out.
Thousand laps around the gym.

1004
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,610
Sure, Zane.
Really.

1005
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,404
All he needs is
a little bit
of charm school.

1006
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:20,614
Of course. And you're
probably headmaster
of that school.

1007
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,949
I am.

1008
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:25,035
Go sit in the car.

1009
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,916
Nice ride.

1010
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:35,462
I think yours
might be a bit
more expensive.

1011
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,507
I really think this
fight's gonna be great
for these two kids.

1012
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:41,802
Teaches them discipline.
It's in a controlled
environment.

1013
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,638
Nick says
the same thing.
Nick...

1014
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,057
I really need
to talk to you
about Nick.

1015
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,018
I don't think this
is an appropriate
conversation, Zane.

1016
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,646
Anthony would be much
better off training
at my school.

1017
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:56,400
Lawyer to lawyer?
Speak, Mr. Attorney.

1018
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,861
Nick tantino's
not the man
you think he is.

1019
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,654
Goodbye.

1020
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,073
He killed someone,
Cassie.

1021
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:07,244
In a fight, in cold blood.
Is that the type of man
you want training Anthony?

1022
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,246
Prove it to me.

1023
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,373
I will.

1024
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,333
You bet
your sweet ass
I will.

1025
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,924
Jill:
That was fantastic.

1026
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,845
I'm so glad we got
together again...

1027
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:28,599
After all this time.

1028
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:32,978
You were on fire!

1029
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:38,275
I guess fighting
keeps you strong.

1030
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,277
Pass me the strawberries?

1031
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:51,413
These past few months
have been so lonely.

1032
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:55,000
If I'm telling the truth,
the past year, really.

1033
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,835
I want another kiss.

1034
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,979
You know, I could see US
rekindling those old
high-school flames.

1035
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:21,235
Jill, I need you
to tell me something.

1036
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:23,820
Something about Nick.

1037
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,573
It'll really help me
with the divorce.

1038
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,617
The more you help me,
the more I can help you.

1039
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:30,410
The truth is,
he doesn't even
deserve this house.

1040
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,538
He doesn't even
deserve half of it.

1041
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,252
Okay?

1042
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,755
Did I tell you
how beautiful you are?

1043
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,757
Did I?

1044
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:49,638
Hey.
Whatcha doin'?

1045
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,598
Something I couldn't do
in the prosecutor's office.

1046
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,141
Huh?

1047
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,770
This isn't true.

1048
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,398
It's Nick tantino's
international rap sheet.

1049
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:02,025
This says he was charged
but not convicted

1050
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,111
of murdering somebody
in Italy when he was 22.

1051
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,196
This isn't real.
Does it matter?

1052
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,074
He did kill somebody
in Italy. Who cares
if he was never charged?

1053
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,910
This is in the international
criminal justice
computer system now

1054
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,912
because I added it.

1055
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:17,165
When he applied to be a cop,
there was no international
computer system.

1056
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,376
So now it will
be discovered.

1057
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,128
I want you to
give it to Cassie
tomorrow, okay?

1058
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:23,297
Okay, Zane.

1059
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:24,965
Thank you.

1060
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,394
( No audible dialogue )

1061
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,899
Nice work, Cassie.
Thank you.

1062
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,861
See you at the office?
Nope.

1063
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:48,280
I am going to
get a beer.

1064
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,948
Okay.
Maybe two.

1065
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,533
Hello, Sandra.

1066
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,452
Always a pleasure,
Megan.

1067
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:55,621
Cassie, I'd love
to speak to you.

1068
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:58,498
That's funny, Megan,
'cause I wanted to speak
with you as well.

1069
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,001
I'll bet my conversation's
more interesting than
your conversation.

1070
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:04,004
I'm not so sure
about that.

1071
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:06,965
Do you know Jill,
Nick's soon-to-be-
ex-wife?

1072
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,801
Sure. Real bombshell.
Hard act to follow.

1073
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,470
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1074
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:14,431
It seems that Jill
likes to videotape

1075
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,643
herself with men--
a new hobby.

1076
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:22,105
Yeah. And it also
seems that Zane

1077
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,650
wanted to hear that
Nick was a murderer,

1078
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:27,611
and when Jill told him
that that just wasn't
the case,

1079
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:30,489
Zane didn't
like that very much,
so he cut her off.

1080
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,616
Now Jill's
a wee bit upset.

1081
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:36,453
Well, what you'll see
in this file is
also not true.

1082
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,039
It's another
phony act from Zane.

1083
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,509
Trenton's the capital
of New Jersey.
Trenton-- capital.

1084
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,886
Paterson, passaic,
Camden, Jersey city--

1085
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,472
come on, Anthony.
Fight back.
Big cities. Trenton.

1086
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,683
At least block.
Trenton, the capital.

1087
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,351
Paterson, passaic,
Camden, Jersey city--
let me try it.

1088
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,948
Ah! Tap, tap!

1089
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:17,077
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
What was that?

1090
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,705
Nick:
That was
a flying arm bar.

1091
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:22,708
I've been training in
martial arts for a long time.
I could never master that move.

1092
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,684
Wow.
He's doing so good.

1093
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,769
I get energized
every time I work
with him.

1094
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,855
His progress--
it's amazing.

1095
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:48,608
I know. It's amazing.
He's on-again,
off-again, and...

1096
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,278
I mean, I don't think
he'll ever be
totally cured,

1097
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:53,864
but the improvements
are just unbelievable.

1098
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:56,616
You know,

1099
00:58:56,616 --> 00:59:00,620
I wonder why he never
responded to Spanish before
unless it was something violent.

1100
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,665
Yeah. I mean,
we never spoke it
at home.

1101
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:06,585
We're completely
americanized.

1102
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:09,045
I only know Spanish
from taking classes,

1103
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,089
and Anthony never
learned it at school.

1104
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,550
Kids rarely even
spoke to him.

1105
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,011
I mean, they spoke
in front of him,
but I think...

1106
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:18,180
I think there's
a big difference.

1107
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,390
He was never
nurtured in Spanish.

1108
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,436
You know,
what worries me
is that...

1109
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,605
Felix knows that,
and he's not gonna be

1110
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:28,732
cursing at him
on the night of the fight.

1111
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:32,652
Do you know what
he just said to me?

1112
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:36,490
He just said that you can
master that move if he
worked on it with you.

1113
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,533
He did not say that.
He did say that.

1114
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:41,703
Are you sure he said that?
I'm sure. I'm positive.

1115
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,663
( Screams )
( Growls )

1116
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,041
( Crowd cheering )
Announcer:
<i> I'll tell you, Jack,</i>

1117
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,460
<i> we've got a lot of excitement</i>
<i> in this place tonight.</i>

1118
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,962
Jack:
<i> Richard winfield</i>
<i> is sheer muscle</i>

1119
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:53,298
with some serious
jiu jitsu skills.

1120
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,383
These guys got energy
going. This is the way
to fight. Ooh!

1121
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,677
What happened to
Henderson's boxing?

1122
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,429
Winfield's punching
his lights out.

1123
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,139
Cassie:

1124
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,482
Yeah! Yes!

1125
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,737
This is crazy!
This is an all-out
street brawl!

1126
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:18,698
Unbelievable!
Look at this guy hit!

1127
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,742
I tell you what.
If I got hit with
one of those,

1128
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:24,246
I'd be in
the back row here.
I'm telling you!

1129
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:46,601
Here we go. Round 2.
Mickey nettles tore Roy rivers
apart in the first one.

1130
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:49,563
This guy's an incredible
grappler. He's got skills
in every area,

1131
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:52,941
but it's on the mat
where he really shines.

1132
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:56,444
What?
Oh, my goodness!

1133
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,697
Man, he can really
rocket a punch.

1134
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:01,157
This one's gonna be
a bloody finish.

1135
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,577
And there we go.

1136
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:06,830
Ladies and gentlemen,
what's a fight without
the flip at the end?

1137
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:11,751
Well, I'll tell you, Jack,
we've got a lot of excitement
in this place tonight.

1138
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,628
Now, I just
love this story.

1139
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,714
Two 18-year-old
high schoolers--

1140
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:17,716
Felix Sanchez,
who's already fought

1141
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:20,051
and won in five
professional fights;

1142
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,804
and Anthony Rodriguez,
an autistic savant,

1143
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,890
who fights with
magic from within.

1144
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:33,648
Cassie:
What are you doing?
Getting ready.

1145
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:39,487
What are you doing?

1146
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,281
I'm getting ready
to fight.

1147
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:45,201
Not Anthony?
No, not Anthony.

1148
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,120
Why don't you sit
down for a minute?

1149
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:55,879
Look, your brother's
got incredible talent,

1150
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:59,633
but these prodigious
fighting skills only come out
when he's taunted in Spanish.

1151
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,968
Felix knows that,
and I'm sure he's gonna
do everything he can

1152
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,346
to speak to him
strictly in English.

1153
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:07,349
Even if I'm on the sideline
yelling nasty things
to him in<i> espanol,</i>

1154
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:09,309
it's too much
of a risk.

1155
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:14,230
We'll continue to work out,
but I've found that training

1156
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:18,026
has helped him so much mentally,
and that's so much more
important.

1157
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:22,197
I don't want to see him
get in that cage and make
a spectacle of himself,

1158
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:24,407
and I'm not gonna
let him get hurt.

1159
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,123
I'm falling
in love with you.

1160
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:39,881
I'm already in love.

1161
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:43,134
So you're gonna
fight Felix instead?

1162
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,970
No.

1163
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,888
I'm gonna fight
Zane carroll.

1164
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,933
Jack:
Oh!

1165
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:52,018
Oh, my goodness!

1166
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,020
( Bell rings )
Announcer #2:
And there it is.

1167
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,022
Another fight
comes to an end.

1168
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:58,024
The crowd is
on their feet.

1169
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,026
The people got
their money's worth
tonight,

1170
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:02,570
and we haven't even hit
the main event.

1171
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,572
Jack:
Got to tell you, though,
Grady, this next one

1172
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,742
is the one that
I've been waiting for.

1173
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,744
It's time
to win, Nick.

1174
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,663
Win, Nick.
Win.

1175
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:13,707
Win. Win, Nick.

1176
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:18,003
Ladies and gentlemen...
Jack: What's this?
They're saying

1177
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:20,005
there's a change
in the fight line-up.

1178
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:22,507
Nick tantino, the cop,
pulled rodriquez
at the last second.

1179
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,551
Any reason why?
We don't know why.

1180
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:26,594
But I tell you,
there's an awful lot
of animosity

1181
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,930
between he
and Zane carroll,
the prosecutor.

1182
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,932
Ring announcer:
In the red corner,
fighting out of

1183
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:34,436
the spitfire academy
in hawthorne, New Jersey,

1184
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:36,438
standing 6' 2"

1185
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:40,108
and weighing 215 pounds,

1186
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:42,736
Zane "the persecutor"

1187
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:45,030
carroll!

1188
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:48,116
Both senseis
are from the same
New Jersey town.

1189
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:50,452
Neither has fought
professionally
in years,

1190
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:52,203
but both were stars
on the rise.

1191
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,581
And in
the blue corner,

1192
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:57,292
also fighting out of
hawthorne, New Jersey,

1193
01:03:57,292 --> 01:04:00,211
representing
the hawthorne institute
of martial arts,

1194
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,338
standing 6 feet

1195
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:06,176
and weighing in
at 225 pounds,

1196
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,553
Nick "the law man"

1197
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:11,514
tantino!

1198
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,808
Your referee,

1199
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,810
samad Rafael.

1200
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,854
All right, gentlemen.
You know exactly
what time it is.

1201
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,439
I want a good,
clean fight.

1202
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:21,816
You obey my commands
at all times.

1203
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:24,444
Gentlemen,
tap gloves
and back up.

1204
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:27,030
Are you ready?

1205
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,407
Are you ready?

1206
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:32,035
Here we go.
Fight!

1207
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:34,579
All right, punk!
Jack: Oh!

1208
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:37,499
Nick tantino disrespected
right off the bat
by carroll.

1209
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:49,427
Jack: I'll tell you,
this isn't a cop you want
to meet on the street.

1210
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:50,929
Grady:
You got that right.

1211
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,931
Straight right by Nick.
Ooh!

1212
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:56,768
Yes!
Come on, Nick!

1213
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:02,941
He's got to
switch it up here.

1214
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:07,737
Aah!
That's a low blow to
the groin by Zane carroll.

1215
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,989
He's in trouble.
Yeah, he's got him
in trouble now.

1216
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:16,371
( Shouting in Spanish )

1217
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:26,172
( Shouting continues )

1218
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,902
( Bell rings )
Jack: Chalk one up
for the police, Grady.

1219
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:50,572
I'll tell you what--
this one is o-v-a, "ova"!

1220
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:52,282
Counselor just
got schooled.

1221
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:54,993
Get off me!
Get off me!

1222
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:58,204
Stay down,
sucker!

1223
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:16,973
Come on, you.
Cover up.

1224
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,434
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.
You got me.

1225
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,774
It appears as if

1226
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,776
you've succeeded
with the kid.

1227
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:31,946
I think we'll take you
back on patrol.

1228
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:35,450
Except I don't
want to retire.

1229
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,410
Once a blue,
always a blue.

1230
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,412
Don't retire
just yet.

1231
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:42,332
That arm bar was lucky.
I'll fight you again
right now.

1232
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:46,252
Hey. What do you say to
a prosecutor that just got
his ass kicked in a fight?

1233
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,838
"You have the right
to remain silent.
You're under arrest."

1234
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,965
For what?

1235
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:53,051
How about
official misconduct

1236
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:56,304
for initiating an
illegitimate law enforcement
investigation against Nick,

1237
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,389
for tampering with
government computers

1238
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:01,017
and creating
a false rap sheet?

1239
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,518
None of this crap will
hold up in court.

1240
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,270
You have the right
to an attorney.

1241
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,105
You know that already.

1242
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,816
If you can't afford
an attorney,

1243
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,361
sell the Ferrari.

1244
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,324
( Rhythmic whooshing )
( Pounding )

1245
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,164
Nick:
Come on, let's go.

1246
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,587
Come on. The crime
can't beat you.

1247
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:37,512
Come on.
It's Zane carroll,
and he's beating you.

1248
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,390
Nice.

1249
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:48,564
Nick:
Want a soda?
No soda. No soda.

1250
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:52,860
Cassie says no soda.
Anthony,
orange juice or water?

1251
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:55,655
Milkshake.
I want a milkshake.

1252
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,115
There you go.
You got your order.

1253
01:07:57,115 --> 01:07:58,449
Want a milkshake too?

1254
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:00,326
No, I'll stick
with the water.

1255
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:06,332
Anthony, do you
want to try the tire?

1256
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:21,389
I'd better
tell you this
in English.

1257
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:27,562
You're probably not
gonna totally get it,
which is okay,

1258
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:30,273
but at least
I'll get it
off my chest.

1259
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:32,400
You see, Zane was trying
to convince your sister

1260
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,235
that I killed somebody.

1261
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:43,202
A long time ago
in Italy,

1262
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:46,039
I went to visit
my grandfather.

1263
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:48,541
He wasn't paying
to the people he was
supposed to pay to,

1264
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:52,378
so they sent some guys
over to his house to
straighten him out.

1265
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:58,343
I saw what they were
doing, Anthony,

1266
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:01,137
and I snapped,
you know?

1267
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:06,059
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

1268
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:44,222
I will tell her.

1269
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,099
Atta boy.

1270
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:47,767
Come on.
Don't stop.

1271
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:50,478
A little harder.
Come on!
