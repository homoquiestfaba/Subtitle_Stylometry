You and Channing Tatum.

168
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,886
I think he's attractive.

169
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,163
I think it's a cool house.
I know you do.

170
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,765
I can't wait to see inside it.

171
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,444
That's why I'm excited.

172
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,241
Ha-ha! Yes!
What's up, man? Seth!

173
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,243
So happy you're here.
I'm so happy to be here.

174
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,560
Hey, Johnny, what's up?

175
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,085
It's Jay.
It's Jay.

176
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,527
I'll never forget it again, man.
Good to see you.

177
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,329
Nice to see you. Come on in.
Yeah! Yeah, great.

180

Really cool. This place
is beautiful, man.

182
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,602
This place is
like a piece of me.

183
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,762
You two just stepped inside me.

184
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,926
You let us both
cum inside you. Yeah.

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,731
Icing on the cake.
Check it out.

186
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,527
Painted them myself.

187
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,921
Huh.

188
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,923
Side by side.
A team.

<font color="#D900D9">(LAUGHS)</font> Holy shit.

190
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,249
So, is it weird?

191
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,288
No.
You sure?

192
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,044
I really like it.

193
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,246
What do you think, Jay?

194
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,448
I'm not a big art guy.

195
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,806
You don't like art?

196
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,769
Well, come on...

197
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,763
You play video games?
Yes.

198
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,888
Well, guess what, buddy?
You like art.

199
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,961
Yep.

200
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,166
You ever been to Subway?

201
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,287
Yes.

202
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,771
You order a sandwich?

203
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,968
Somebody put that together for you, dude.
That's art.

204
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,121
Sandwich artist.

205
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,440
So, let me
lay this on you, Jay.

206
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,521
Oh, fuck.

207
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,806
Your mama's pussy
was the canvas.

208
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,644
Your dad's dick
was the paintbrush.

209
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,722
Boom.
You're the art. Huh?

210
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,244
Thanks, James Franco.
You got it.

211
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,810
Seth!
Mindy, hello.

212
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,484
Oh, my God, great to see you.
Oh, you, too.

213
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,800
Long time.
How's it going?

214
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,167
You know Jay? I don't think
I've ever actually met you.

215
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,890
You were so good in
<i>Million Dollar Baby.</i>

216
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,002
That's amazing. Thank you
so much for saying that.

217
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,003
Oh, my God, if I don't
fuck Michael Cera tonight,

218
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,088
I'm gonna blow my brains out.
What?

219
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,367
Fucking pale, 110 pounds,

220
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,922
hairless, probably has a huge
cock, coked out of his mind...

221
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,241
You can do a lot better.
That's just trouble.

222
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,881
So, Ri-Ri, how about you,
you ever see a psychiatrist?

223
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,166

you shut the fuck up, Jason!

227
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,409
We're playing a game, man.

228
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,649
Say cheese, baby.

229
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,445
What's up, buddy?
How's it going, dude?

230
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,726
Good to see you, man.

Oh, my God, get in here, dude.

How's it going, Jonah?
What are you doing?

234
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,521
Good. How you doing, buddy?
Oh, my gosh.

235
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,648
Welcome back.
Thank you very much.

Uh, this morning,

237
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,523

What have you guys been doing?

242
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,923
Oh, we just hung out all day.

243
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,925
Ate a bunch of dirty burgers, and
smoked about a fucking pound of weed

244
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,411
and played
a bunch of video games.

245
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,721
Weed is tight. Weed is tight.
That's awesome.

246
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,040
That's awesome.
Weed is awesome.

247
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,447
It was like the golfing
sequence in <i>Navy SEALs.</i>

248
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,568
Sick reference, though, bro.
Oh, thanks, bud.

249
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,802
Dude, your references are out of control.
Everyone knows that.

250
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,484
Hey, thanks, man.
I'm jealous.

251
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,847
I would have been there
in a heartbeat,

252
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,242
but, uh, I actually just adopted
this incontinent spaniel.

253
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,401
She's a really beautiful soul.

254
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,130
Her name's Ahjhai.
Ahjhai?

255
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,247
Yeah.
How do you spell it?

256
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,845
A-H-J-H-A-I.

257
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,086
A-H...

258
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,127

a picture of her?

Oh, she's so sweet.
Hey!

<font color="#808080">SETH:</font> Aw!

She doesn't know
how to bark, even?

She doesn't know how to bark,

264
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,244
so I've tried to teach her

265
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,482
and she just kind of
screams, and so she was up,

266
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,245
had her face smushed against
the cage, and was, like...

tonight's the night

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,360
we bust this whole thing open.

to the birthday cake?"

killed the other one,

324
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,682
and he wants to assassinate
Woody Harrelson,

325
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,770
'cause he's gonna give a speech
that makes all of weed legal,

drug lords out of business.
