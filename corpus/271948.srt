a multiple homicide

00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,733
- Yes.
- I wouldn't know. I just got here.

Now if you don't mind.

152
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,608
Is the government willing to say
anything about the vehicle's contents?

Or about who the men were
and what they were doing?

154

And any possible connection
to any AI-Qaida

Do we tag this
as body number six?

- What's that?
- Scale.

00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:50,500
Aaah!

180
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:51,667
Carl!

181
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,108
Carl!

182
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,413
Carl! Carl!

183
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,811
[Screaming]

184
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,348
Carl!

185
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,710
Carl! Carl!

186
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,448
[Screaming]

187
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,991
[Carl groans]

188
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:10,891
[Roaring]

189
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,055
[Screams]

190
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,134
Agent Sharpe! Agent Sharpe!

191
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,975
Would you mind putting
my evidence back?

192
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,378
Sorry. I found this
in the back of the truck.

193
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,818
Where exactly does that lead?

194
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,853
That's one of the access tunnels
to the Philadelphia

195
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:36,886
water treatment plant.

196
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:37,956
Thank you, Deputy.

197
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,960
You should clean up. You got
a piece of liver on your chin.

198
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,531
Right.

199
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,759
Maybe I should.

200
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,095
Looks like it's some sort
of tranquilizer dart.

201
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,696
But for what?

202
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,175
I'm not sure yet.
But whatever it is, it woke up.

203
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,579
Agent Sharpe, I just got a call
from the treatment plant.

204
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,845
Apparently,
they were just attacked.

205
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,382
Attacked by what?

206
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,116
They said a giant snake.

207
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,454
Call the plant back.

208
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,257
Tell them I want
this entrance sealed,

209
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,456
all main lines
connected to it turned off,

210
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,624
the facility itself evacuated.

211
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,724
Are you asking me
to have them turn off

212
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,532
the only major source of water
for this half of the state?

213
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,230
I'm ordering, not asking.

214
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,739
I don't mind telling you

215
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,833
that people in this state
get a little upset

216
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,845
when their toilets don't flush
and the sinks are dry.

217
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,374
I see.

218
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,886
We'll need maps and diagrams
of every aqueduct, pipe and tunnel,

219
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,956
all ways leading in and out of that system.

220
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,117
If that thing's down there, I'm not about to let it
back out,

221
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,286
not until we can call in
some serious firepower.

222
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,295
Call in two reserve units.

223
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,957
Have the highway patrol lock off
all traffic within five miles.

224
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,399
Then I want everything we've got
on the Larson project.

225
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,336
That was a CIA project gone bad.

226
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,168
A couple big snakes
got loose in Russia

227
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,571
and wiped out the entire team.

228
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,007
- Just get me the file.
- Right.

229
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,711
And get me Monica Bonds.

230
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,944
[Woman]
I don't work out.

231
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,470
Two minutes isn't bad,
but I can beat it.

232
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,369
Tyler here's half fish.

233
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,482
Yeah? I bet I can take him.

234
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,811
I don't think so, cupcake.

235
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,885
I got 50 bucks
that says I can.

236
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,283
I'll take that action.

237
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,116
- Make that two.
- This'll be sweet.

238
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,521
Tyler was in Navy Seal school,
before he got discharged.

239
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,592
Really?

240
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,490
I've done a little
Navy ordnance

241
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:30,653
and mine-sweeping myself.

242
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,252
- You searched for mines?
- Yep.

243
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,922
- With Navy divers?
- Nope.

244
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,465
Dolphins.

245
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,929
[Girls cheering]

246
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,739
[Guys cheering]

247
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,361
Thirty seconds!
We only have 30 seconds!

248
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,244
Come on, buddy.
Speak to me. Are you all right?

249
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,183
Here. I know CPR.

250
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,915
I don't know what you did to him down there.
Just stay back.

251
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,321
You all right? You okay?

252
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,916
Did I win?

253
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,488
Bro, you got spanked by a chick.

254
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,565
Thank you. Thank you.

255
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,727
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

256
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,168
Thank you.

257
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,573
Monica Bonds?

258
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,673
Who's asking?

259
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,371
Agent Sharpe wants to see you.

260
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,473
There's a car waiting to take you to the airport.

261
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,726
- How are things at the institute?
- Great.

262
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,022
We got three new dolphins
coming in next month.

263
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:47,360
Working hard and making some real progress.

264
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,128
I can see that.

265
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,726
I didn't have time to put a full ensemble
together.

266
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,102
I appreciate you coming here
on such short notice.

267
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,334
With you, Alan, it's always short notice.

268
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,176
What are we doing
out here in the backcountry?

269
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,440
Your boys told me
to pack for Philadelphia.

270
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,016
How well does your equipment work out of the
water?

271
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,676
Why do I get the feeling

272
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,516
you're about to ask me
for four years of research?

273
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,785
Haven't had a chance to field-test it

274
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,451
out of the water yet, but

275
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,756
the sensor pads were designed
for wet or dry applications.

276
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,525
It should work fine.

277
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:23,430
Well, you're about
to get your field test,

278
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,503
compliments of Uncle Sam.

279
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,072
What kind of doctor is he?

280
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:41,482
Dr. Emmett is one of the world's leading
herpetologists.

281
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:42,951
That's kind of creepy.

282
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,954
You haven't even met the man.

283
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,991
In my book, people who
play with snakes are creepy.

284
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,596
It's locked. Maybe there's another entrance.

285
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,863
Emmett?

286
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:00,199
He's probably got the whole crazy, bug-eyed,

287
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:04,935
Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Goldblum
mad scientist thing going on.

288
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:08,444
Pasty skin, doesn't see the sun much.

289
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,708
Definitely has social interaction issues.

290
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:11,783
Agent Sharpe?

291
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,248
Yeah. No.

292
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,789
He's...

293
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:22,792
Alan Sharpe,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

294
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,886
And this is Monica Bonds with
the Miami Aquatic Research Institute.

295
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,130
Hi.

296
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,705
Pleased to meet you.
Please come in.

297
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,273
Thank you.

298
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,862
[Beeping]

299
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:01,898
Impressive lab.

300
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,627
It used to be.

301
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:06,499
I'm working out of pocket
for the moment.

302
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,596
The place requires constant funding.

303
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,904
I know the feeling.

304
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,877
Doesn't it bother you,
working with these things?

305
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,381
I mean, one bite and you're history.

306
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:19,711
Snakes are like other creatures.

307
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,285
Respect them, and they'll respect you.

308
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:24,184
You have to know what you're doing,
especially with the poisonous kind,

309
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,654
like the one you're tapping there.

310
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,486
[Hisses]

311
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,196
I understand you've grown

312
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,493
a rather large snake
here on the premises.

313
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,398
She's a constrictor...
a Scarlet Queen boa.

314
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,232
May we see her?

315
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,173
Mm.

316
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:54,684
[Buzzer sounding]

317
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,559
Follow me.

318
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,197
[Beeping]

319
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,161
You need all this for a snake?

320
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,498
You might want to stay close.

321
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,551
It's a little smaller than I imagined.

322
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,716
This isn't Betty.
This is Betty's lunch.

323
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,919
You feed snakes to snakes?

324
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,622
I inject the food snakes
with a dose of venom extract,

325
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,461
which is then digested
by the Scarlet boa.

326
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,966
- Won't that kill her?
- Doses are minute.

327
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,128
Absorbed into her bloodstream
before she knows they're there.

328
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:48,262
Her system then works
to create an antibody

329
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,273
which I can then harvest.

330
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,640
Betty is the largest
constrictor on the reserve,

331
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:57,146
probably the largest
Scarlet boa on the planet.

332
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:00,445
And she produces a vast amount
of antibody for my research.

333
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,814
You're creating
an antivenom.

334
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,887
Trying to, anyway.

335
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,387
It's all extremely
interesting, Doctor,

336
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,013
but hardly
the reason I came.

337
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,591
Where's the boa?

338
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,922
[Chuckles]
She's standing on him.

339
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,489
Shit!

340
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,095
Aaah!

341
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,463
[Shrieks]

342
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,473
[Roaring]

343
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,149
Outstanding.

344
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,186
This is big.

345
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,792
And big is nice.

346
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:44,191
Well, color me
officially curious.

347
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:45,387
Assuming we didn't come

348
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,988
all the way out here
just to see some gigantic snake,

349
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,465
I'm dying to know
what kind of situation

350
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:55,164
could possibly require the use
of his boa and my implants.

351
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,706
Doctor Emmett,

352
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,538
how well would your boa perform
in an uncontrolled environment?

353
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:00,736
Well, I wouldn't know.

354
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,679
She's the first of her kind
to be born and raised entirely in captivity.

355
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,375
- Would she hunt?
- Absolutely.

356
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,612
Snakes, no matter how they're raised,

357
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,416
It's a matter of survival.

358

In that case,
I'd like to use your boa

359
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,654

360
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,831

370
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,981

371
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,915

376
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,015

382

to deliver to you.

However, being that
I am a man of my word,

385
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:03,192
I've decided to do one better.

386
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:07,321
That's why I'm going
to deliver you to the hunt.

387
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:10,196
Babe, would you do the honors?

388
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:13,031
I'm sorry. Would anyone else
care for a drink?

389
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:16,903
We are fully stocked here,
so choose your poison.

390

00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,108
I'll have a Sprite, please.

393
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,614
Can I have a cold one,
too, actually?

394
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,585
Uh-huh.

395
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,158
- And for you, Mr. Foley?
- Surprise me.

396
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,591
Since this is my first time

397
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:42,222
hunting this particular predator,

398
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,234
I thought it only fitting
that I invite those associates

399
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:48,100
who would truly appreciate
the experience.

400
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,901
And I assure you

401
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:53,910
this is a once-in-a-lifetime, gentlemen,

402
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:58,073
an experience that will
truly separate the men...

403
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,672
from the beasts.

404
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:01,809
We are hunting

405
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,912
one of the most cunning predators on this
planet.

406
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,652
We are the knights
that are going to slay the dragon.

407
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:14,530
If you take a look inside the expedition
dossiers my beautiful associate Eve

408
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:19,729
has prepared, you'll see I've taken the liberty
of mapping out a few routes.

409
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:24,604
We will be landing outside Philadelphia
in approximately two hours.

411
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,977
From there we shall depart
for the hunt at 7:00 a.m.

412
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:35,178
So, you're telling us
that this thing is on the loose

413
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,619
and that you
are going to find it?

414
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:39,621
Exactly.

415
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,282
The only thing that

416
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:45,988
you need to concern yourselves with,
gentlemen, is your aim

417
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,122

near the water supply.

427
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:20,120
I'm not about to send armed men blindly down
there so they can become snake bait.

428
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,200
But with your expertise and boa
and your equipment,

429
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:27,567
I believe we can successfully locate
and eliminate that python.

430
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,072
Using my implants,
we can track the boa

431
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,608
as it tracks the python
and see every move she makes?

432
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,735
- Exactly.
- Let me get this straight.

433
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,780
You want to attach that to my boa

434
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:40,510
and use it to hunt down
the python that this belongs to?

435
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:42,586
That's the stupidest idea
I've ever heard.

436
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:46,248
Is it? The Navy trains seals
and dolphins to sweep for mines.

437
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,258
The Army uses dogs for security
and tactical engagement.

438
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,659
It's a hell of a leap from dogs
and dolphins to wild reptiles.

439
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,096
It's not as great a leap as you think.

440
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,962
The CIA has been conducting
extensive tests

441
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,865
on the potential
combat and covert ops

442
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,200
applications with specimens like yours.

443
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,136
Why doesn't the CIA
use its own specimens?

444
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:06,005
Their point man on the project
was forced to take

445
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,943
an unfortunate "leave of absence"
during a mission in Russia.

446
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,607
The project's dead.

447
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,116
So we're the best you got, huh?

448
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,845
Yes.

449
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:20,014
I guess the question now is
whether that stuff's actually going to work.

450
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,785
I've been successfully
using the implants

451
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,485

452
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:24,686
With the digital microcam,

453
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,287
audio sensors,
and GPS monitor in this unit,

454
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,595
we can practically monitor
your boa's every move.

455
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,225
And I've called in
military reinforcement

456
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,735
to back up our operation.

457
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,705
Most snakes are territorial,
especially the big constrictors.

458
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,275
Your point being?

459
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,968
Take two scorpions,
put 'em in a box,

460
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,340
they're both going to want
to own that box.

461
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,038
They'll fight till
one of them dies.

462
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,808
So your boa will
attack that python?

463
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,612
If she picks up the scent,
she'll attack, theoretically.

464
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:48,412
Then what?

465
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:51,818
After the boa's done her job,
she'll be returned to the lab.

466
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,153
After she's been
immobilized, of course.

467
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,749
- Immobilized how?
- That you'll have to let me look into.

468
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,328
We better move.

469
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,294
It's almost dark,
and, unlike most snakes,

470
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,866
the constrictors
are corpuscular.

471
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,128
Sorry, I must've skipped
biology class that day.

Your python is
already out of the tunnel.

00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,168
Impossible. I've got three teams
working with local authorities,

and tunnel in the area.

Agent Sharpe, judging by
the size of that scale,

477
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,445
we're talking about
an 80 to 100 foot reticulated python.

706
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,586
it may have staked out
this adjacent area.

707
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,351
How do we know the python
will return to these tunnels?

708
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:31,825
We don't. Another hour, the sun's
going to be pretty strong out there.

709
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:34,192
It'll seek out the coolest place possible.

710
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:37,095
Let's just hope when it does,
it comes back down here.

711
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,258
Yeah.

712
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,768
[Typing, beeping]

713
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,072
Keep your eyes peeled.

714
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,477
Okay, we'll split up here.

715
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,851
Dad? Dad.

716
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,518
Dad!

717
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:06,694
I told you to do that back at the plane.

718
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:09,459
Or you'll have to wear
a catheter like your old man.

719
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:12,160
This ain't one of
your dumb-ass video games.

720
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:15,670
Make sure you wait
until you get a kill shot.

721
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:17,296
Yeah, I'll remember.

722
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,170
Oh.

723
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:20,675
God, I hate you.

724
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:28,479
You travel light.

725
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,212
I don't believe in wasting bullets.

726
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,116
One?

727
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:33,522
I never needed more.

728
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:36,023
I did a Google search
on pythons last night.

729
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,890
Apparently, when they squeeze you,

730
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:40,860
they can feel your heart beat.

731
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:43,262
The faster your heart beats,
the tighter they squeeze you.

732
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:47,894
Just remember what I told you.
Show no fear.

733
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:49,062
[Birds squawking]

734

735
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:13,487
Stay put.
We'll circle back and flank you.

736
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:21,369
Eve, what's your position?

737
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:25,165
We're on your left, babe.

738
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:26,765
I've got you.

739
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:29,311
Possible sighting behind us.

740
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:32,848
Push ahead of me 50 yards.
Stagger the line. Wait for my signal.

741
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,213
Copy that. Let's do it.

742
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,517
There it is, boy!
Go get it!

743
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,891
What are we
waiting for?

744
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,691
Broddick's signal.

745
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:50,164
Oh.

746
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,462
Guy like that has it all...

747
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:54,628
his own casinos,

748
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,569
a tasty biscuit like her,

749
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,904
and now first shot
at killing that snake.

750
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:04,470
And we're just going to sit back
and let him take it.

751
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:07,476
Fuck that.

752
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,121
Damn it.

753
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:18,527
Okay, AV link's back.

754
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:20,687
Finally. Let's move out.
Move out.

[Emmett]
Where is she?

756
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:26,200
I can't tell. Damn it!
I lost the signal again.

757
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,131
Shouldn't we wait for them?

758
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,207
And stay here all day till Blondie

759
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:33,242
gets her Game Boy to work right?

760
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:34,640
Let's find this thing,

761
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:38,077
tag it, bag it and get
the hell out of here.

762
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:40,308
These retaining walls are between us and the
boa,

763
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:41,850
but it's not on the GPS.

764
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,443
They're disrupting the signal.

765
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,182
Has anyone seen our soldiers?

766
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,123
Broddick, we have a problem.

767
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,561
Foley just went AWOL.
Tex took off after him.

768
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,564
Amateurs.

769
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,190

770
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,935

771
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:07,575
Fuck.

772
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:09,977

00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:17,047
Aaaah!

775
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,328
Mr. Foley, what happened?
Where is Tex?

776
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,335
I don't know.
When I got back, he was gone.

777
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,463
I have two very simple rules
here on this hunt.

778
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:40,407
Number one:
Never leave your team.

779
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,410
Number two:

780
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,615
Stay the fuck away
from my girlfriend.

781
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:51,451
Who's firing?

782
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,920

Let him have it!

786
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:11,298
I've been waiting 15 years to use this!

787
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:14,070
Fire in the hole!

788
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:22,012
Cease fire! Cease fire!

789
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:31,292
Congratulations, James.

790
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:33,760
I'm sure this will look wonderful stuffed and
mounted

791
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:36,457
on the wall of your father's den.

792
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:39,160
- It'll look great above the fireplace.
- Shut up.

793
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:42,534

lost our tactical edge...

I think I found where our snake went.

If I were a disgusting 80-foot reptile,

798
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:02,892
those tunnels are
exactly the kind of place

799
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:06,291
I'd go to wait out the sun and find a drink.

800
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:07,727
Then that's where we're going.

801
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,197

802
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,565

and reload for round two.

Well, they're intelligent, social.

877

They interact well with humans.

878
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,624

a little easier to get to know 'em.

Why snakes?

I lost someone very close
to a snakebite.

When I was six,

893
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:53,901
I traveled with my family
through South America.

894
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:56,774
We were staying in this village
outside of Buenos Aires.

895
01:01:56,879 --> 01:02:01,942
One night, my little sister
goes to get a drink of water,

896
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:05,987
steps on a pit viper that was curled up
under the bathroom sink.

897
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:09,581
The village doctor couldn't figure out
which antivenom to administer.

898
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:13,822
By the time my dad did the 15-mile drive
to the nearest hospital,

Oh, I'm sorry.

901

I guess I figured that,
working on the antivenom,

But there's another signal
moving toward her.

909
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:41,722
It must be the python.
What's the location?

910
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:45,885
I don't know.
I think she's in some sort of service tunnel or...

911
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:49,226
Diversion tunnel.
Look.

912
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:54,167
She's in one of these two passages
located underneath the main pipe tunnel.

913

- They're connected by this link.
- Part of some overflow system.

- Both snakes would be contained.

to be trapped in those tunnels

We flood the system. We force them
to go where we want them to go.

The sublevels both drain
into this underground reservoir here.

down there too, did you?

1054
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:01,920
No. But we've got
your laptop equipment

1055
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:04,618
up and running at
our camp in Philadelphia.

1056
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,694
We'll be there
in 10 minutes.

1057
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:31,145
Asshole.

[Laughing, shouting]

1059
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:47,431

[Beeping]

1061
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,742
And we're back in business.
Well, sort of.

1062
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:56,743
I've got GPS and audio.

1063
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:00,346
Visual's basically a bust.

1064
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,178
Implants must be damaged.

1065
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:05,344
- Location?
- About four blocks east of us.

1066
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:08,514
What's it doing
all the way over there?

1067
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:12,060
- Probably checking on her brood.
- What are you talking about?

1068
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:15,789
Oh, don't you know?
We stumbled into her nest.

1069
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:19,196
Broke one of her eggs
accidentally.

1070
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:21,394
That's why that bitch reptile
killed my girl.

1071
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:25,530
- Can you play it back on the video feed?
- Sure. Give me a sec.

1072
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,374
I got it.

1073

[Whirring]

1074
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:35,578
Okay, slower. Stop.

1075
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:37,845
There. Now zoom in.

1076
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:46,490
The only species
of a boa to lay eggs?

1077
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:50,827
There's no way he could impregnate her
and then she lay eggs within an hour.

1078
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:54,459
No. She must have
already been pregnant.

1079
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:58,130
That's why she was fighting off the python.
She was defending her nest.

1080
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:01,903
Either that, or she's just
got good taste in men.

1081
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,671
Oh, no.

1082
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:13,753
Why is she letting him eat her eggs?
What's wrong with her?

1083
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:16,585
She must be too injured to fight.
When was this recorded?

1084
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,183
Fifteen, 20 minutes ago.
Look.

1085
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:26,033
- At least we know she's all right.
- And she's after the python.

1086
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:27,761
Your snake has
a sense of vengeance?

1087
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:29,598
That's what we're
about to find out.

1088
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:34,199
I wonder if you officially
made her shit list, Broddick.

1089
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:39,837
Mclntyre.
Well, just don't stand there!

1090
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,620
- Stop! Stop!
- Fuck off.

[Whooping]

1092
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:25,458
I should've known
she was pregnant.

1093
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,688
It must've been a combination
of the food snakes and the gro<i>wt</i>h hormone.

1094
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:32,756
Or maybe it was just nature's way of letting you
know you're doing all right.

<i>[Rhythmic</i> b<i>eating]</i>

1096

- Whatever it is, it's live.

1097
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:45,577
- Sounds like machinery.
- It's music.

1098
01:19:46,848 --> 01:19:50,215
