00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:02,894
You were explaining about the scholarship, sir.

739
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,562
Yes. Of course, thank you.

740
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:05,496
Thank you, Brad.

741
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,298
How is the award decided?

742
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,835
Well, first your records are reviewed by myself

743
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:11,836
and the selection committee.

744
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,605
Goes without saying, any disciplinary problems

745
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,874
will give you a serious black eye.

746
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:18,809
Your grades are important,

747
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,913
but just as important are the extracurriculars.

748
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,949
Athletics, club memberships, offices held.

749
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:28,019
And I should add that we still have spring elections

750
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,954
and tryouts for graduation speaker,

751
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:32,957
either of which would be a substantial feather in your cap.

752
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,994
The winner will be announced at graduation.

753
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,429
Good luck.

754
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:39,931

755
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,899
I presume you'll take into account some applicants

756

are planning to attend prestigious universities,

757
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,971
like Yale, for example.

758
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:49,941
Ah yes. That's, that's a legitimate point, Dr. Burris.

759
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,910
Have Brad mention that on his application.

760
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:54,946
What a suck up.

761
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,417
Whoa!

765
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,464
That's kinda hot.

766
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:14,432
What you doing, money?

767
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:15,633
Oh, oh, oh, what's up, money?

768
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,569
I was just getting ready for some ball, baby!

[upbeat music]

770
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:31,716
And so my fellow graduates, I think I speak for all of us

771
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,385
when I say tonight we graduate.

772
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,054
God, that's so feeble.

773
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,024
Hey. No temperature.

774
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:44,028
In mines, men start talking to self

775
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,596
just before go. [whistling]

776
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,931
Oh no, I'm okay, Uncle Nick.

777
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:49,367
I was practicing for a speech.

778
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,635
A speech?

779
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,070
You're going to be a speaker like Socrates?

780
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,038
I doubt it.

781
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:55,439
I just thought I'd try out for graduation.

782
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:56,707

783
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:57,642
Fantastic!

00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:58,609
We'll invite all the cousins.

785
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,077
No, no, I'm just trying out.

786
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,079
Probably won't get it.

787
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:05,049
What do you mean?

788
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,784
You speak wonderful English.

789
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:08,953
Well, yes, but there are other kids trying out.

790
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:10,688
Experienced speakers.

791
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,891
If they not choose you, it is fixed.

792
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:14,759
Let me tell you.

793
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,095
[Tiffany] Hello?

794
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:19,830
Oh no.

What's the matter?

It's the girl you like?

797
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,877
Very nice. Fantastic chest.

Ah, the pretty one with dark hair?

Yes.

802
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,487
I mean no.

00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,022
God, what am I saying?

804
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,624
I like her.

805
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,593
Oh, the two of you will make beautiful babies.

806

Yeah, take your order.

Anyways. He was like, \"I called you last night.\"

813
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,742
And I was like, \"No you didn't.

My phone doesn't show when people don't call.

Can we pay for this with baseball cards?

818
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:17,922
It depends on the cards.

819
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:18,889
Your order is...

820
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,093
Yeah, it'll be right up.

Sure. He's Chris Karas.

823
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,669
He's in our English class?

824
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,536
Duh.

825
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,573

Yeah, well, for a nobody you mean?

I mean he seems nice, period.

01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:52,975
Time for Operation Slime!

1281
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,444
Let's do it.

1282
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:55,778
Look out, here comes Burris!

1283
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:56,412
Shoot.

1284
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,053
[Sound pop]

1285
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:09,826
Sorry for the technical difficulties, everybody.

1286
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:11,360
We'll have everything back to normal in a jiffy.

1287
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,029
Dammit, we didn't get to drop the balloons.

1288
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:15,331
That was gonna be the best part.

1289
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:16,365
[Madeline] Yeah, oh!

1290
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,367
I can't take it any more!

1291
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,502
[Joe] Get this off!

1292
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:20,369
Oh! Oh!

1293
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:23,573
[Madeline] Take me!

1294
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:26,042
Oh! Is that who I think it is?

1295
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,176
Sounds like it.

1296
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:28,344
Yeah, oh! If it is,

1297
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,079
they are right behind the curtain.

1298
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:31,414
Do you know how to work it?

1299
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:32,482
I'm not sure.

1300
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:38,488
Yeah, oh!

1301
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:42,492
Joseph, I'm like floating on a boat in a storm.

1302
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:43,526
[Joe] Oh yeah?

1303
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:44,460
Yes, take me!

1304
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,863
I can't believe this, where's the Dean?

1305
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:48,397
[Joe] Yeah, yeah!

1306
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,134
Oh, I could devour you!

1307
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:53,536
[Dean yelling]

1308
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:58,441
[students yelling]

1309
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,014
Don't worry folks!

1310
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,283
Everything's under control.

1311
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,953
Close the curtain!

1312
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:22,031
[slime splashing]

1313
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:25,067
[students cheering]

1314
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:27,336
[Splat]

1315
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:35,011
Well, a little bit of slime never hurt anybody.

1316
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:36,512
[Prankster Call]

1317
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:45,988
[tense music]

1318
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:48,224
Believe me, I have had it up to here

1319
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,059
with this Prankster garbage.

1320
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:52,094
Let me kick their ass, Dean.

1321
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:54,163
We have to know who they are first, Blotto.

1322
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:55,865
Oh, stupid.

1323
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:58,901
Brad here has come up with a brilliant plan.

1324
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:01,637
The Dean's gonna videotape an announcement

1325
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,173
to play on the school's closed circuit system.

1326
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:06,008
Our job is to leak this information.

1327
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:08,544
Why?

1328
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:09,378
My father's security consultant

1329
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:11,480
planted a microchip in this tape.

1330
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,683
Since the Pranksters love to sabotage the Dean's speeches,

1331
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:16,619
they'll steal it, and then we track the chip, and bingo!

1332
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:18,054
I'll kill 'em!

1333
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:19,088
Well, are you sure this will work?

1334
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:20,556
I mean, they're not stupid.

1335
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,124
Oh!

1336
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:23,526
Oh, it'll work.

1337
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:25,528
It's too juicy for them to resist.

1338
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:30,366
[Photographer] Okay, everybody together.

1339
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:33,269
Here we go, everyone smile.

1340
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:37,540
Oh, that's great.

1341
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:39,275
What club is this? Medical careers.

1342
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:40,476
That's me, all right.

1343
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,578
Motivational psychologist.

1344
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,347
Ear, nose and throat.

1345
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,548
Gynecology.

1346
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:48,618
My friends tell me there are many openings in this field.

1347
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:57,126
You believed this? My God.

1348
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:59,328
[laughing]

1349
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,597
Well, it looks like your handwriting.

1350
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,699
Am I really that melodramatic?

1351
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,135
Thank goodness the superintendent

1352
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:07,436
has given us a second chance.

1353
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,505
Why are these kids doing this to us?

1354
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:12,008
Oh I know it's embarrassing, Joe,

1355
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:14,310
but try not to take it so personally.

1356
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:16,579
What?

1357
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:18,681
Well, I just... [laughing]

1358
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:23,352
I just think these pranks are just youthful acts

1359
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:24,720
of self expression,

1360
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,089
and they're pretty creative ones at that.

1361
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,259
Whose side are you on, Madeline?

1362
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,560
This isn't creativity.

1363
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,597
It's insubordination and it must be stopped.

1364
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,635
Let's roll tape.

1365
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:40,736
Oh, all right.

1366
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,075
Three and, okay.

1367
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:49,378
Good afternoon.

1368
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:51,247
A clear and present danger has been posed

1369
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,582
to the security of this administration.

1370
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:57,586
I promise you that as long as Joe Pecarino is your Dean,

1371
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,522
the forces of disorder and chaos

1372
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:01,590
will never triumph at Tres Rios High.

1373
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:05,361
Cut. How was that?

1374
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:07,797
It's a bit strident.

1375
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:08,631
Really?

1376
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:10,333
Well just try it again,

1377
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:12,702
only this time take it down a notch.

1378
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,770
Pretend you're at my place.

1379
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:15,638
Okay.

1380
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,743
Oh zoot, we're out of tape.

1381
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:22,611
Oh that's okay. I can get another one.

1382
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,085
I'm just gonna go to the little girl's room.

1383
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:29,752
Freshen up.

1384
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:33,656
[laughing]

1385
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:38,027
[alarm beeping]

1386
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:49,705
Yeah?

1387
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,074
Oh yeah, baby.

1388
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:55,745
Yeah, you the man. No, you the man.

1389
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:57,813
No, you the main man.

1390
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,619
Say hello to my little friend.

1391
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,788
You the man.

1392
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:06,622
You know what you are?

1393
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:07,823
You the babe.

1394
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,658
You the hot babe.

1395
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:10,493
Yeah.

1396
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,561
Bad knee, could have played pro ball.

1397
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:16,799
You look good. You look real good.

1398
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:18,100
They call me Big Joe.

1399
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:19,435
You wanna meet Little Joe?

1400
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:21,804
You love me?

1401
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:23,305
I love you too, baby

1402
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:26,709
Yeah baby.

1403
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:27,576
What?

1404
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:30,079
You wanna see me naked?

1405
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:32,581
I wanna see you naked.

1406
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:35,584
[lusty growl]

1407
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:38,187
[pensive music]

1408
01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:58,741
Hey boss.

1409
01:07:58,774 --> 01:07:59,842
[Chris] Hey.

1410
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,510
What do you think of this one?

1411
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:08,884
I am caught in this curling energy, your hair.

1412
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,420
Whoever is calm and sensible,

1413
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:14,290
is insane.

1414
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:18,561
It's different.

1415
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:22,198
It's Rumi. Great Sufi poet.

1416
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:26,836
Something bothering you?

1417
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:31,807
Okay.

1418
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,810
So graduation speaker tryouts are tomorrow.

1419
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:36,712
Now, I've been practicing my speech all day,

1420
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:38,881
but I don't know if it's any good.

1421
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:43,819
The point is, if I lose the competition,

1422
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:45,821
I won't get the scholarship I need to go to college,

1423
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:48,491
and my life will be ruined permanently.

1424
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:50,292
Oh, poor boy.

1425
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,895
No worry so much.

1426
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:55,764
I'm sure your speech is fantastic.

1427
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,266
No, Uncle Nick, it sucks.

1428
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:04,673
You know old Greek story of eagle and chickens?

1429
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:05,508
No?

1430
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:06,709
All right, listen.

1431
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:12,781
One time there was a baby eagle. Lived with chickens.

1432
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,283
Not know he was eagle.

1433
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,753
He grew up in yard acting like chicken,

1434
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,188
thinking he chicken.

1435
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:23,826
One day, fantastic bird pass in the sky.

1436
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:26,328
Fly so beautiful.

1437
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:31,934
\"What kind of bird is that?\" ask little eagle.

1438
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:34,904
Other chicken say, \"Oh, that's eagle.

1439
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:38,841
\"We can never be like this.\"

1440
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:44,747
So that little eagle spent whole life in yard

1441
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,348
thinking he only chicken.

1442
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:48,817
Sad, eh?

1443
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,353
Yeah.

1444
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:53,155
Chris, my nephew.

1445
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:57,459
Don't live life like chicken in yard.

1446
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:02,631
Okay.

1447
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,903
We've narrowed it down to two of you

1448
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:10,039
whom we'd like to hear again.

1449
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:13,342
Brad Burris and Chris Karas.

1450
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,346
But most of all, I thank my wonderful teachers

1451
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:19,982
for their invaluable help along the way,

1452
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:21,584
and Dean Pecarino,

1453
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:23,953
the best Dean this school has ever had.

1454
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:26,622
Thank you.

1455
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,724
And so we venture forth into the world,

1456
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:32,428
taking with us the fond memories and invaluable lessons

1457
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:33,963
that we've been fortunate enough

1458
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:36,265
to learn here at Tres Rios.

1459
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:38,334
Thank you.

1460
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:42,471
I want you both to know

1461
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:45,007
this was a very difficult decision.

1462
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,310
The committee feels both of you were excellent,

1463
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:50,479
but unfortunately we can only choose one.

1464
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:53,015
Chris Karas.

1465
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:55,651
[applauding]

1466
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:56,986
What did I tell you?

1467
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:00,823
You are eagle!

1468
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:02,825
So you have scholarship?

1469
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:05,628
No, not yet, but I will be speaking at graduation,

1470
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:06,695
and that should help a lot.

1471
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:08,397
Okay.

1472
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:09,498
We'll have some ouzo.

1473
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,035
A toast to the eagles!

1474
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:15,337
Okay.

1475
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,373
Yasou.

1476
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:24,747
[gentle music]

1477
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:39,461
Hey.

1478
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:42,031
Where were you this morning?

1479
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:43,198
Figured an ace suck up like you

1480
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:45,734
was probably getting a ride from one of his teachers.

1481
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:47,770
Maybe the Dean himself.

1482
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,638
What are you talking about?

1483
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:50,706
Morning Bulletin.

1484
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:54,943
Hearty congratulations to senior Chris Karas,

1485
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:57,946
winner of graduation speaker tryouts.

1486
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,149
We know Chris will be a great representative

1487
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:02,584
for our class and school.

1488
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:04,420
Look, Larry, I was gonna tell you.

1489
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:07,623
Guess it doesn't help to explain.

1490
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,125
Some things in life aren't explainable, Chris.

1491
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:10,993
This is one of them.

1492
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:12,061
How could you do this?

1493
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:12,895
I needed to, okay?

1494
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:13,962
For the scholarship.

1495
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,064
Scholarship?

1496
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:17,733
Outstanding Teenagers of America?

1497
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:19,134
Oh!

1498
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,803
This is too good.

1499
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:22,738
Wow, when you decide to suck up, you go all the way.

1500
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:24,006
Outstanding Teenagers of America?

1501
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:25,708
That is the biggest suck-up award there is.

1502
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:26,909
I had no choice.

1503
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:28,410
Bullshit you had a choice,

1504
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:30,179
and you decided to stab your friends in the back.

1505
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:32,147
What did you expect from me?

1506
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,949
What, to play pranks the rest of my life,

1507
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:35,584
skip college and become homeless?

1508
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:37,920
Or worse yet, work for my father?

1509
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:40,989
We all have our problems, Chris.

1510
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,858
It's the way you decided to handle things.

1511
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:45,027
Yeah, well what way would you have approved of?

1512
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,031
Look, I don't know Larry.

1513
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:50,933
Maybe we should cut Chris some slack.

1514
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:53,802
No, he sucked up big time,

1515
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:55,771
and a Prankster never sucks up.

1516
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,075
Come on guys, let's nab that tape.

1517
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:01,543
Listen, be careful, okay.

1518
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:03,979
There's something weird about the Dean's speech.

1519
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:05,981
You're out of the loop, pal.

1520
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:07,649
How about you? You coming or not?

1521
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:11,153
I don't think so.

1522
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:12,488
You guys aren't so much fun anymore.

1523
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:17,192
[student laughing]

1524
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:19,762
Well, if it isn't Larry's little play pal.

1525
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:20,963
Looks like you've been playing with more

1526
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:23,132
than just baseball cards.

1527
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:24,500
What are you talking about?

1528
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:26,135
What she means, bed wetter,

1529
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:29,004
is that you've been messing with a Letterman's squeeze.

1530
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:30,606
What's going on?

1531
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:32,040
We were just talking to your new friend.

1532
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,777
Does Eric know that you've been cruising with him?

1533
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,947
He was just giving me a ride home.

1534
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:40,749
Oh well that's not what I hear.

1535
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:44,219
You don't know jack, Tiffany.

1536
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,255
Excuse me, I think that Eric is the one

1537
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:49,858
who doesn't know what's going on.

1538
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:52,561
I bet he doesn't even know that you work as a house cleaner.

1539
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:53,929
[Students] Oh!

1540
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:56,965
You're whack.

1541
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:59,201
Yo man, this little wimp's been messing with your woman.

1542
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:01,136
I think you ought to dust him.

1543
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,871
Hit him. Get him.

1544
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:05,974
[Group] Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!

1545
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:08,110
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!

1546
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:09,812
Pecarino's coming!

1547
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:15,818
Behind the gym after school.

1548
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:16,785
Behind the gym!

1549
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:22,124
Why didn't you just tell me?

1550
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:27,896
I was afraid you might not like me if you knew.

1551
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:28,764
That's silly.

1552
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:32,835
What about this thing with Chris?

1553
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:35,070
We're just friends.

1554
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,140
I believe you.

1555
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:40,642
Then you won't fight?

1556
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,179
If I backed down, what would people think?

1557
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:46,148
That you have a mind of your own?

1558
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:53,188
Isn't it amazing that adolescent boys

1559
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:54,857
still engage in primitive rituals,

1560
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:57,960
like maiming each other behind the gym?

1561
01:14:57,993 --> 01:15:00,796
I find it more amazing that I'm the prospective maimee.

1562
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:02,898
Why don't you do something radical?

1563
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:05,200
Like hand him a flower.

1564
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,302
Or roll over on your back, like a dog.

1565
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:10,639
Just trying to help.

1566
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:15,043
[tense music]

1567
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,314
You ready?

1568
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:22,751
Yeah.

1569
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:25,621
Hey.

1570
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:26,355
Yeah. Listen, do me a favor.

1571
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:27,890
Just keep everyone away, okay.

1572
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:28,724
This could get ugly.

1573
01:15:28,757 --> 01:15:31,159
All right, bro.

1574
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,761
All right, everybody back up.

1575
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:33,695
Come on guys, get back.

1576
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:34,730
You don't want to see this.

1577
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:35,364
Come on.

1578
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:38,066
[tense music]

1579
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:43,138
[students chattering]

1580
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:49,311
This is bogus.

1581
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,281
Works for me. What about them?

1582
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:55,217
Can you fake it?

1583
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,852
Can I fake it?

1584
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:58,287
Can the Dalai Lama meditate?

1585
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:05,193
Let's go.

1586
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,695
Ready?

1587
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:08,864
[banging] [groaning]

1588
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:12,734
[banging] [groaning]

1589
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:14,236
Okay, let's not get carried away.

1590
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:17,372
Well, you don't want them to think we're lightweights.

1591
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:19,241
[banging] [groaning]

1592
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:20,108
No, wait.

1593
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:27,249
[banging] [groaning]

1594
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:29,051
[laughing]

1595
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:31,353
[groaning]

1596
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:38,226
Now who do you suppose should win this thing?

1597
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,261
Right.

1598
01:16:39,294 --> 01:16:40,362
Forgot, I'm the wuss.

1599
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,265
All right, let's wrap this up.

1600
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:49,538
Ketchup?

1601
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:52,174
You didn't really think I was gonna kick your ass, did you?

1602
01:16:56,345 --> 01:17:00,115
[banging] [crowd moaning]

1603
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:01,350
No more, I give.

1604
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:05,354
[students moaning]

1605
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:08,657
Learn from that, dude.

1606
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:14,830
How could you?

1607
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:23,405
I was beginning to think maybe you were cool.

1608
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:24,239
My mistake.

1609
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:27,776
Hey wait.

1610
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,111
Are you okay?

1611
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,379
Yeah, I think so.

1612
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:39,988
Maybe it's not such a good idea for you to be seen with me.

1613
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:41,490
Doesn't matter.

1614
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:44,192
Ever since Tiffany found out about my family,

1615
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:45,360
I've become an outcast.

1616
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,463
Yeah, that makes two of us.

1617
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,142
Hey! Stop!

1618
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:03,412
It's not what you think.

1619
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:05,447
Really? What was it?

1620
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,215
A love fest?

1621
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:09,351
We didn't want to fight, so we faked it.

1622
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,320
If you don't believe me, go ask Chris!

1623
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,855
I swear it's true.

1624
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:27,402
No, no, no, no, no worries, it's deactivated.

1625
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:29,771
We can reactivate it at will.

1626
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:30,806
So check this out.

1627
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,442
Say hello to my little friend.

1628
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:36,778
You the man.

1629
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:37,412
You know what you are?

1630
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:38,480
You the babe.

1631
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:39,748
Hot babe.

1632
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:42,417
You the big man, you're the hot babe.

1633
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:45,220
[laughing]

1634
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:46,154
Chris was right.

1635
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:48,423
Too bad he isn't here to see this.

1636
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:49,458
Yeah, we owe him one.

1637
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:51,193
Where is he anyway?

1638
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,361
Probably sucking up as we speak.

1639
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:58,400
[crowd applauding] [music]

1640
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:01,503
