00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:53,219
For Mr. Eames'
heartfelt efforts, b-plus.

722
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:56,422
And here, at last,
the intellectual strainings
of our Mr. Edgerton.

723
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:58,224
For Mr. Edgerton, a d-plus

724
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,726
and a "see me after class."

725
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:03,462
[ School bell rings ]

726
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:20,912
- Are you satisfied
with your grade?

727
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:24,583
- I really worked on this.

728
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,017
- For a change.

729
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,487
- I deserve better.

730
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,520
- I agree.

731
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:30,856
What happened?

732
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:33,692
I had no idea
you could write like this.

733
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,261
- Why'd you give me
such a crummy Mark?

734
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:37,329
- I loved your idea.

735
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:39,197
Everything else was awful.

736
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:40,632
But, David, this shows me that

737
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:43,702
you are capable of achieving
a literary career.

738
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:44,812
- I'm glad I'm not even
more talented.

739
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,438
You'd have given me an "f."

740
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:47,973
- This
is an English language class.

741
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:50,242
I don't grade these papers
on style.

742
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:53,579
"D" is what you deserve
for your grammar and syntax.

743
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,481
- All the stuff
that doesn't matter.

744
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:57,549
I'm interested in the soul
of my work.

745
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:58,660
- That's what the plus which

746
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:01,019
follows your "d" is for.
- That's great.

747
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,421
Unfortunately, explanations like

748
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,155
that are sort of lost
on my parents.

749
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:07,426
- Before you can break
the rules, young Wordsworth,

750
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:08,760
you must master them.

751
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:10,796
- So I keep hearing.

752
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,039
- Correct the areas I've marked.

753
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,031
I'll see what I can do about

754

755
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:20,706
And, David, when you're done,

756
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,108
I'd like to have it read
for the literary magazine.

757
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:24,109
- You're kidding.

758
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:26,077
- Yes, actually, I am.

759
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:27,112
No, David.

760
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:28,780
I want to submit it.

761
00:37:30,316 --> 00:37:31,817
- Far out!

762
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:32,784
- "Far out?"

763
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:34,228
I thought I was teaching
you English.

764
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,087
- Later, Mr. Bainbridge.

00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,294
- [ Coughs ]
- Songbird to penny.

766
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:43,495
Come in, penny.

767
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:45,030
- Hmm?

768
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:46,565
- Where were you, honey?

769
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:47,899
I was talking to you.

770
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,034
- Oh, I'm sorry.

771
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,669
Must have been daydreaming.

772
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,471
- The way you've been sleeping?

773

"Night, bill."

Whoosh.
Out like a light.

775
00:37:55,474 --> 00:37:57,008
- I've been exhausted.

776
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:59,277
Those kids can drive you crazy.

777
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,413
- You've only got two
to worry about.

778
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:02,581
I've got dozens.

779
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:03,791
You don't hear me complaining.

780
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,917
- That's very unfair.

781
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,520
My major was history,
not home Ec.

782
00:38:08,554 --> 00:38:09,955
- I'm sorry, honey.

783
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,590
I didn't mean...

784
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,725
It's just that you
can't give in.

785
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,260
You have to stay tough.

786
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,062
- I'm tougher than you think.

787
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,065
In fact...

788
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:22,434
I want to teach next semester.

789
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,703
- That's not a good idea.

790
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:25,971
What would people say?

791
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:27,373
I can support my own family.

792
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:28,607
- It's not about money.

793
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,075
- You're not even certified.

794
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:31,309
- I can tutor.

795
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:32,878
I can take on private students.

796
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:34,012
- You have enough to do.

797
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,280
You have a home and children.

798
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,915
- I can do both.

799
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,217
Milly took that job at Wilson's.

800
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,920
- You're not Milly.

801
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:43,822
- What's that supposed to mean?

802
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:52,330
I thought I wasn't supposed
to feel sorry for myself.

803
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:54,199
Why do you?

804
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,038
- Mrs. Kunen.

805
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,342
Mr. Bainbridge
is giving my story
to the literary magazine.

806

- Rip.
- Rip!

- I told you I knew
what I was doing.

809
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:14,219
- Well, I see we have a number

810
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:15,754
of interesting subjects today.

811
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:22,694
First, student concern
over the advanced level
of courses at mount Eden.

812
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:28,434
I've asked James Parker,
our senior class president,
to present the students' view.

813
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:32,137
[ Cheers and applause ]

814
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,139
- Thank you, Dean shays.

815
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:37,876
- Mr. Parker, correct me
if I'm wrong, but isn't

816
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,946
superior academics
the very reason
for mount Eden's existence?

817
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:42,714
- Of course, Mr. Kunen.

818
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:44,450
We feel perhaps more could be

819
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:45,760
retained if more
were comprehended.

820
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:48,386
[ Cheers and applause ]

821
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,055
We feel too much of our time

822
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,289
goes into memorizing things

823
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:52,190
we're probably gonna forget

824
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,859
within 24 hours of any exam.

825
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,427
We think if more emphasis were

826
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:58,530
put on understanding
the material, we could
probably derive

827
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:00,732
even greater benefits
from our world-class

828
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:02,568
faculty's knowledge
and experience.

829
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:05,070
[ Cheers and applause ]

830
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,210
- I think we must be doing
something right.

831
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,812
- You realize, don't you, that

832
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:15,313
none of this matters.

833
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:16,114
- Helen?

834
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,016
- The extent of each student's

835
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:20,318
experience isn't important.

836
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,220
They're just elements of the sum

837
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,889
total of experience.

838
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,659
- I'm afraid I don't
quite understand.

839
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:28,693
- Well...

840
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:32,564
The students, like ourselves,

841
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,766
are just vehicles.

842
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,337
There are millions,
billions of vehicles
in the world.

843
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,706
Telephones and electric lights

844
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:41,840
are vehicles.

845
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:43,374
But neither of them will run

846
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:44,876
without electricity.

847
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:47,646
If the vehicle is in working

848
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,615
order, plugging it in will make

849
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:51,416
it run.

850
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,985
But if it's worn out...

851
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:55,654
No matter how much electricity

852
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:59,224
you course through it,
it won't function.

853
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:01,693
- Psychosomatic.

854
00:41:01,727 --> 00:41:02,928
- Well, perhaps I'm a little

855
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,796
obtuse, but...

856
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,298
I fail to see what
this has to do with our subject.

857
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:11,136
- Robert, it's the same with us.

858
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:14,973
We are the electricity that

859
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:16,808
allows our vehicles to run.

860
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:21,212
So, even if your vehicle
is better than mine,

861
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:24,315
that doesn't alter the nature
of your true existence,

862
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:29,988
which is part of a very large
force in which we're all one,
in which we all share.

863
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:38,496
And when your vehicle
is destroyed, the electricity
which you represent

864
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,199
returns to all electricity,
the same as mine.

865
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:45,003
Is that more clear?

866
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:48,073
- Thank you, Helen.

867
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:53,478
- Helen, what are you
talking about?

868
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:56,114
- They know what I mean.

869
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:02,420
- Mrs. Electricity.
[ Laughs ]

870
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:05,023
- I'd finally begun to think.

871
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:06,658
The problem was my mind had not

872
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:09,961
yet had a chance
to catch up to my experience.

873
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,985
- I'm not in the mood
to discuss this.

874

- No, I'm serious.
What the hell were you
trying to say last night?

00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,379
I'm interested.
- His wing's getting stronger.

876
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:30,124
We're gonna have
to think about letting him go.

877
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:33,318
- Does this have anything
to do with the way
you've been acting lately?

878
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,186
- Just how have I been
acting lately?

879
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,955
- Come on.
You know what I'm talking about.

880
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:38,499
- No, I don't know
what you're talking about.

881
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:39,567
Why don't you explain it to me.

882
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,959
Just how have I been acting?

883
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:44,395
As far as I'm concerned,
I've been acting just fine.

884
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:45,363
- Okay.
Forget it.

885
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,431
I'm okay, you're okay.

Everybody's fine.

887
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:49,000
- Maybe you're not so hot to me.

00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,470
- What are you trying to do?

00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:53,605

I thought I told you
not to put that...

- Helen.

893
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:01,046
- No, don't touch me.
I'm fine.

- Give me your hand.
- No, I don't need your help.

That's what you keep telling me.

- Everybody needs
help sometimes.
