1
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,549
<i>117 AD The Roman Empire stretched.</i>

2
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,399
<i>from the African desert
to the Caspian Sea...</i>

3
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,473
<i>...but its farthest, most untamed
frontier was Northern Britain.</i>

4
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,988
<i>In this unforgiving land,
the Roman Army</i>

5
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,191
<i>encountered fierce resistance</i>

6
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,557
<i>from a people known as the Picts.</i>

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,591
<i>Using guerilla tactics</i>

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,268
<i>and the landscape
to their advantage,</i>

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,751
<i>they brought the invasion to a halt.</i>

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,797
<i>The stalemate
has lasted almost 20 years.</i>

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,918
<i>Rome has given orders to end
the deadlock</i>

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,473
<i>by any means necessary...</i>

13
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,148
<i>My name is Quintus Dias,
I am a soldier of Rome,</i>

14
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,392
<i>and this is neither the beginning
nor the end of my story.</i>

15
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,108
2 WEEKS EARLIER

16
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,519
INCH- TUTH- IL. MOST NORTHERLY GARRISON
ON THE FRONTIER.

17
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,277
<i>Two years on the frontier.</i>

18
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,038
<i>This place
is the arsehole of the world.</i>

19
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,231
<i>Even the land wants us dead.</i>

20
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,715
Centurion Dias, it's too darn cold
to be standing watch.

21
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,193
It's not my watch.
I was just wondering what's out there.

22
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,876
The patrol returns at dawn;
you should get some sleep.

23
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,235
<i>The longer we stay
the deeper the cold and damp</i>

24
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,839
<i>soaks into our bones;</i>

25
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,436
<i>and the rain makes way only for
the stinging bite of the North wind.</i>

26
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,559
<i>While we lose brave men
to foot rot and frost bite,</i>

27
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,909
<i>the Pict king, Gorlacon</i>

28
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,118
<i>sends his war parties to raid
along the frontier at will.</i>

29
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,919
- Gentlemen.
- Evening, sir.

30
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,633
Cold night on the front.

31
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,758
<i>My father believed that
to truly defeat an enemy</i>

32
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,916
<i>you must know him
better than yourself.</i>

33
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,237
<i>I know this enemy well.
They play only to their strengths</i>

34
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,516
<i>and will not be drawn
into open combat.</i>

35
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,314
<i>Instead they pick at the scab
until we bleed,</i>

36
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,916
<i>hiding in the shadows like animals,
striking hard and fast,</i>

37
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,918
<i>then falling back into the night.</i>

38
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,750
<i>Come the dawn we count our losses
and sow the earth with our dead.</i>

39
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,150
<i>This is a new kind of war.</i>

40
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,794
<i>A war without honour, without end.</i>

41
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,635
Come on!

42
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,918
Marcus, ride to Agricola.

43
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,557
Gate. Move!

44
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,911
Move, soldier!

45
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,433
- Gratus.
- Save yourself.

46
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,672
Go to hell.

47
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,513
We should kill them all.

48
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,711
This one could be useful!

49
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,875
He comes with us!

50
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,311
Virilus! Virilus!

51
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,519
YORK
GARRISON OF THE NINTH LEGION

52
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,394
The winner!

53
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,232
Yes!

54
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,989
Again.

55
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,548
Enough!

56
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,554
You put up a good fight,
now you drink with me.

57
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,673
Septus, more ale.

58
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,037
Again, Virilus.

59
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,511
You're a drunk.
An ugly drunk.

60
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,556
And not too bright.

61
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,316
Isn't ten times enough to know
when you're beaten?

62
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,437
Damn you. Again!

63
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,357
Once more.

64
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,428
Septus, your ruling....
and watch my flank.

65
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,513
Come on!

66
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,277
Sore loser.

67
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,479
Septus.

68
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,597
What are you waiting for, an order?

69
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,398
Get stuck in there!

70
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,111
Damn, that'll sober a man up quick.

71
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,035
When will people learn not to fuck
with the Ninth?

72
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,389
Some say it's irregular for you
to be seen drinking

73
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,191
with the men of the legion.

74
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,352
Septus, my old friend, they forget
I am a man of the Legion.

75
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,149
Soldier, have you been fighting?

76
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,478
Fighting is my job.

77
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,830
I have a message for your General

78
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,469
Now, point me in his direction
before I have you flogged.

79
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,835
Who are you?

80
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,435
I am the personal envoy
of Governor Agricola.

81
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,469
I suggest you get down off that horse
and give me your message

82
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,795
before I have you flogged!

83
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,032
General, sir. It would be my pleasure.

84
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,318
All leave is cancelled.

85
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,472
Agricola is mobilising the Ninth.
We're going to war, Septus.

86
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,029
Alert the senior legates to break camp
and prepare the men.

87
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,718
- Sorry, General, sir...
- Return to Agricola at once.

88
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,269
- Tell him we rode out within the hour.
- Yes, General.

89
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,788
Bastard!

90
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,871
Time to die, Roman.

91
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,313
<i>Gorlacon.</i>

92
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,756
<i>He was a farmer
until his wife was killed.</i>

93
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,034
<i>then he put down the plough
and took up the sword.</i>

94
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,038
<i>He changed the way the Picts fought.
It worked.</i>

95
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,758
<i>He turned the tide,
so they made him king.</i>

96
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,995
I will not yield.

97
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,315
What does Agricola intend
for my people?

98
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,276
- Damn you, Pict.
- When will he send his armies North?

99
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,114
I am a soldier of Rome.
I will not yield!

100
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,636
Know your enemy my son.

101
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,438
Rome will make you bleed for this.

102
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,591
You first Centurion.

103
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,237
CARLISLE.
HEADQUARTERS OF JULIUS AGRICOLA

104
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,993
I don't care how you do it
but wipe them out...

105
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,517
...and bring Gorlacon
before me in chains.

106
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,909
Governor, you're the politician,
I'm just a simple soldier...

107
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,472
But I'm not so simple that I can't see
you're looking for a way back to Rome.

108
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,035
My bones ache for Rome.

109
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,231
This place is the graveyard
of ambition.

110
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,919
And men.

111
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,079
And I won't sacrifice mine
to be pawns in your game.

112
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,868
I see.

113
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,998
Let us be frank, General.

114
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,076
The conquest of Britain
is a lost cause.

115
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,914
With one bold stroke
we could change all that.

116
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,278
With the Ninth Legion at your command
we can crush this enemy.

117
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,597
You and your men
could retire with wealth and honour.

118
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,671
My men have honour enough.

119
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,874
Enough to disobey a direct order?

120
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,439
Well...

121
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,919
...to kill the snake
you have to cut off its head.

122
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,031
I need to find Gorlacon.

123
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,200
For that I have someone special
in mind.

124
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,714
General Virilus, meet Etain.

125
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,834
My Brigantes tracker.
Can't speak a word...

126
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,713
but she can hunt anything
over any terrain.

127
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,550
I swear she's part wolf.

128
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,918
I apologise for the theatrics,
but I wanted to prove a point.

129
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,630
Slaves cost nothing.
Trust is priceless!

130
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,310
- I don't know whether to fight her or...
- She's mute, not deaf.

131
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,834
- I have my own scouts.
- Not like her. She knows the Picts...

132
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,991
...knows their ways,
knows their hideaways.

133
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,236
She will guide you
into the mountains.

134
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,678
What's she sitting over there for?

135
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,388
- She's been looking at you all night.
- I know she has. I've spotted it.

136
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,717
Can't take her eyes off you.

137
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,191
Come on, come on you.

138
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,357
She's speechless you daft bastard.

139
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,036
She's got no tongue in her head,
you fool. I wouldn't get too close.

140
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,515
No tongue, that's perfect...

141
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,836
she'll have more room for this...

142
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,277
I think that's Pict for 'fuck off'.

143
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,910
She must be a good scout
if she can find your cock.

144
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,997
I think it's love.

145
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,316
I'll have a go
with the mutt this time.

146
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,350
Report?

147
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,915
Three Pict riders, and another;
a prisoner on foot.

148
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,037
I think he might be Roman.

149
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,996
Centurion Remus, take the column.

150
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,996
Stay down... stay down... stay down.

151
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,591
We'll get nothing out of him.

152
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,231
We can't take prisoners on the march,
you know what to do.

153
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,031
- Head or ship?
- Head.

154
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,919
I win.

155
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,270
Sorry, mate. Orders are orders.

156
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,673
Thank the Gods you found me.

157
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,150
Not the Gods you should thank,
it's her.

158
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,392
Etain, our Pict scout.
She found you.

159
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,637
What's your name, soldier?

160
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,590
My name's Quintus Dias.
Second in Command.

161
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,189
Inch- tuth- il frontier garrison.

162
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,155
Well,
sorry we couldn't get here sooner.

163
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,115
- Are you the relief column?
- Not quite.

164
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,914
I'm Titus Flavius Virilus,
Commander of the Ninth Legion.

165
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,310
We've come here looking for a fight.

166
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,312
Then you'll get one.

167
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,756
- General.
- Centurion Dias.

168
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,748
Now you look like a Roman.
How do you feel?

169
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,309
Cuts and bruises, sir.
Nothing that won't heal in time.

170
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,357
Well, sometimes there are scars
that cannot be seen.

171
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,388
You escaped the clutches
of Gorlacon

172
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,078
but I must ask you to return with us
into the lion's den.

173
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,149
Best to get back into the fight,
General.

174
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,030
- Spoken like a soldier.
- Gladiator.

175
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,916
My father was Scipio Dias.

176
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,993
I saw him win the fight
that earned him his freedom.

177
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,112
- He was magnificent.
- He taught me how to fight.

178
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,669
When to choose my battles.

179
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,389
Come meet the men.

180
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,798
- Septus.
- Sir?

181
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,429
Get this man a drink.
I think he deserves it.

182
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,155
Come and join us. Be warm.
Have a well earned drink.

183
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,594
Thank you.

184
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,591
Tomorrow you ride by my side.

185
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,831
Perhaps you can teach me
something about Pict hospitality.

186
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,957
Thax. Bothos.

187
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,277
Septus, I'll be doing my rounds.

188
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,236
Evening, General.

189
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,998
I can't understand
a word of these Picts.

190
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,117
If they ever catch me, I'm fucked!

191
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,510
I've never seen a General
so beloved of his men.

192
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,389
Well, in training he is our scholar,
at the feast he is our father,

193
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,870
in the ranks he is our brother.

194
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,635
And in battle he is the God we pray
to save our souls.

195
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,673
- Where did you read that.
- It's written on the shithouse wall.

196
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,879
- Probably wrote it himself.
- He's a ruthless, reckless bastard....

197
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,513
...and I'd die for him
without hesitation.

198
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,397
- It's a trap!
- Column!

199
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,517
Form up. Form up.

200
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,914
Quickly. Come on!

201
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,879
Dismount!

202
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,315
Get the horses to the rear.

203
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,832
Tight. Quickly.

204
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,349
Steady, boys. Shields!

205
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,870
Watching!

206
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,119
Whatever comes out of that mist, lads,
you will hold the line.

207
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,958
Quintus, ride to the rear.

208
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,639
Find Centurion Remus,
tell him to pull the column back.

209
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,440
- Make a hole.
- Keep watching.

210
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,753
Get ready.

211
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,311
Watching.

212
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,071
Hold the line!

213
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,239
Stand tall.

214
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,511
- Quintus.
- Bothos.

215
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,069
- You made it.
- This man saved my life.

216
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,992
Brick, here.

217
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,196
- The General?
- No.

218
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,113
We've got to move.
Can you make it?

219
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,271
- Yeah, yeah.
- Come on.

220
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,678
Let's get moving.

221
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,753
<i>In the chaos of battle,
when the ground beneath your feet</i>

222
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,594
<i>is a slurry of blood, puke, piss</i>

223
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,195
<i>and the entrails
of friends and enemies alike,</i>

224
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,793
<i>it's easy to turn to the gods
for salvation</i>

225
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,589
<i>But it's soldiers who do the fighting
and soldiers who do the dying.</i>

226
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,959
<i>And the Gods
never get their feet wet.</i>

227
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,114
- Thax.
- Thank the Gods some of us made it.

228
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,713
Only you?

229
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,797
Macros, second cohort.

230
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,711
Leonidas,

231
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,558
junior scout and peltast.

232
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,472
Are we all that's left?

233
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,792
We were out smarted.
That's all, time to go home.

234
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,638
We need to find the General's body.
He deserves a nobler tomb than this.

235
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,552
The General is still alive.

236
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,870
- Are you sure.
- I saw them take him away in chains.

237
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,638
- Which way?
- North.

238
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,030
- Then we follow north.
- You would go after the Picts?

239
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,192
They'll have patrols sweeping
these forests for survivors.

240
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,351
We might as well slit our own throats.

241
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,834
If the General's alive, it's our duty.

242
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,238
- Where did you come from?
- From the kitchens.

243
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,552
Good work, soldier.

244
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,432
My name is Tarak.
I'm not a soldier, I'm a cook.

245
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,996
Not any more. Scavenge what you can.
Food supplies, weapons.

246
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,356
Ditch your armour, we travel light.

247
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,716
Shit! That Macros can move.

248
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,110
He used to be a marathon runner
before he joined up.

249
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,830
- How do you know that?
- We make the food, we know everything.

250
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,348
Take cover.

251
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,120
I knew we should never have trusted
that bitch.

252
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,831
I know where they've taken
the General.

253
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,119
Move out.

254
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,917
This way. The cave.

255
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,715
Get up those mountains. Get up!

256
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,753
Here, some food.

257
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,390
No.

258
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,197
Death Caps.
They can kill you in minutes.

259
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,197
To the untrained eye they look similar
to these, which are delicious.

260
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,752
Thanks.

261
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,551
Tarak. It's Assyrian, right?

262
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,674
Yes. But it's not my real name,
it was given to me.

263
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,876
- What's your real name?
- I doubt you could pronounce it.

264
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,998
It's from the mountains
of the Hindu Kush where I was born.

265
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,112
Leonidas, right?

266
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,828
- Greek father, sir.
- Move closer to the fire.

267
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,149
Where are you from, Bothos?

268
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,068
I'm from the army.
It's all I've ever known.

269
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,153
They picked me up from the street,

270
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,079
trained me,
told me I could better myself.

271
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,708
So, tell me, Bothos.
Do you feel better or worse?

272
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,111
Macros?

273
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,830
I escaped with my life
by running from Numidia.

274
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,553
Didn't stop until I reached Greece.

275
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,711
Then I ran for sport.

276
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,030
Now I'm running for my life again.

277
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,635
We're all a long way from home.

278
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,511
This was supposed to be my last tour.

279
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,316
Still could be.

280
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,394
Had my eye on a farm in Tuscany

281
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,352
where the sun warms the skin.

282
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,478
Brick, what kind of name is that,
anyway?

283
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,475
Short, sir, for Ubrickulius.

284
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,317
Your mother must have been... wise.

285
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,596
She was a fucking comedian.

286
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,793
Brick, it is then.

287
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,598
Get some sleep.
I'll stand first watch.

288
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,990
- General.
- Where are my men?

289
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,753
With your Gods.

290
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,513
Traitor.

291
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,275
She would answer your charge
but she cannot speak. Do you know why?

292
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,913
She was a child when she came to us
seeking sanctuary.

293
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,708
Her own village had been slaughtered
as punishment for resisting Roman rule.

294
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,714
To set an example they burnt out
her fathers eyes.

295
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,237
They raped her mother until
she was begging to die.

296
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,954
Etain was forced to watch
before she too was raped.

297
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,229
And finally they cut out her tongue
that she may not speak ill

298
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,755
of the bloody Roman empire.

299
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,395
She fled north
and came to us for shelter.

300
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,430
We raised her
and made her one of our own.

301
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,394
And when she came of age
we sent her back to you...

302
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,799
...to feign allegiance
and deliver you into our hands.

303
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,348
The army is still dispersed.
When it's dark we go in!

304
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,829
Let's go.

305
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,149
Go.

306
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,109
Go.

307
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,193
Go.

308
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,475
Pict dog!

309
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,430
Come on.
Come on.

310
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,598
Brick, Bothos with me;
the rest of you watch the perimeter.

311
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,193
- General.
- The Legion?

312
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,000
Only myself
and a small cohort remain.

313
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,158
Oh, fuck.

314
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,750
Oh, shit.

315
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,839
Come on.

316
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,957
Leave me.

317
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,751
Come here.... come here.

318
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,558
Shut up...

319
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,432
Shut up.

320
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,911
- Shit.
- Leave!

321
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,513
We will not abandon you, sir.

322
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,275
What's left of the Legion
is yours to command, now go.

323
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,997
We have to leave.

324
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,039
Go now.

325
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,117
Get them home.

326
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,311
That's for the Ninth!

327
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,798
Where's Thax?

328
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,151
Had to take care of a small problem.

329
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,277
I've got the General's helmet,
where is he?

330
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,040
We couldn't free him.... Come on.

331
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,356
We came all this way for nothing.

332
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,353
Fuck.

333
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,077
See what you have done?

334
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,959
Before you die,

335
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,913
know that the men who did this
will not live to tell your tale.

336
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,790
Well, let's get on with it, then.

337
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,311
Your Roman friends should have known,

338
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,114
cold iron does not bend.
It breaks.

339
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,158
Well, what are you waiting for?
Do you fear me?

340
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,550
No man brave enough?

341
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,673
Let's see
what you're made of she- wolf.

342
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,353
Go.

343
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,274
We need to keep moving
while we have the lead.

344
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,396
On foot, over this?

345
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,955
Wherever they may hesitate,
we must go.

346
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,431
We keep moving, North.

347
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,477
But our lines are to the South.

348
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,874
And that's where they'll be
looking for us.

349
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,317
Look, we can't out run them.

350
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,837
So we have to outsmart them.

351
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,635
We head North. Throw them off our trail
then double back;

352
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,757
West, then South.

353
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,713
It may take days, even weeks

354
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,631
but we're so far behind enemy lines

355
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,910
it's our only chance of getting home.

356
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,189
Come on.

357
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,116
You'll be needing this then,
Centurion.

358
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,995
Etain, you are my wrath.

359
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,993
Send their bodies to hell
and bring me their heads.

360
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,153
<i>When the Picts come after you
they never stop.</i>

361
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,470
<i>They can run for hours,
ride for days.</i>

362
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,188
<i>They barely eat and rarely sleep.</i>

363
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,872
<i>Etain, like the wolf,
has learned to hunt from birth.</i>

364
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,151
<i>It is part sense, part instinct.</i>

365
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,994
<i>She can read the terrain,
search for signs of passing.</i>

366
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,232
<i>Run her quarry to ground
and close in for the kill.</i>

367
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,917
<i>Now she hunts Romans.</i>

368
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,597
<i>Now we are the prey.</i>

369
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,593
Move! Keep moving!

370
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,555
Leo, we've got to keep moving.

371
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,075
- No. We need to rest.
- I can't go on, I'm too cold.

372
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,673
Come, take him.

373
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,718
Brick, find shelter,
anywhere out of this wind.

374
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,431
Enough. Help me.

375
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,910
He's slowing us down. Just say
the word and I'll take care of it.

376
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,313
We live united or die divided...

377
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,716
...starting with you.

378
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,194
You can stick this out if you want
but first chance I get

379
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,272
and I'm taking care of myself.

380
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,869
It's your funeral.

381
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,675
<i>When they paint their faces
in the blue woad</i>

382
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,793
<i>it is more than just a decoration
it is a sacred right.</i>

383
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,990
<i>To the Picts it means
they'd sooner die than fail.</i>

384
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,316
<i>It means for them
there is no turning back.</i>

385
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,270
<i>These men are the best
I've ever seen.</i>

386
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,276
<i>Am I worthy enough to lead them?</i>

387
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,675
<i>My father taught me that in life</i>

388
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,476
<i>duty and honour
matter above all things.</i>

389
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,751
<i>A man without his word
is no better than a beast.</i>

390
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,875
<i>I made a promise to a General
to get his soldiers home.</i>

391
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,151
<i>That is my task, that is my duty.</i>

392
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,475
Not bad for a Greek. Come on.

393
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,757
Drink while it's hot.

394
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,471
- What is that?
- The stomach.

395
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,870
The moss inside is half digested.

396
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,757
Try it, it's good.
