00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:39,638
You know, my husband
must have made a mistake.

365
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,483
It's supposed to say Payton.

366
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,563
Any chance you can change the name?

367
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,798
[Employee] Can you spell that for me?

368
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,800
It's spelled P-A-Y-T-O-N.

369
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,793
Thank you.

370
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,050
Can she have one?

371
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:00,808
Do you want a cupcake?

372
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,643
Yes, please.

373
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,138
Which one would you like?

374
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,908
That one, with the unicorn

375
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:11,897
and don't look a mistake.
[Nicole laughs]

[mid-tempo upbeat music]

379
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:08,608
[Lily] Let me out.

380
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,678
Let me out.

381
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,513
One second.

382
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,348
Come on, Missy.

383
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,841
Look at your face. Who painted this?

384
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,688
I didn't paint it, it's my cupcake.

385
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,523
Let's go.

386
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:26,963
We have to hurry, it's her birthday.

387
00:20:28,307 --> 00:20:30,488
[Lily grunts]

388
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,938
One second. Let me open the car.

389
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,990
[Lily] It's locked.

390
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,758
Here, do you need help?

391
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,263
- I can help you.
- Yes, please.

392
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,209
Better hurry.

393
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:41,223
Okay.

394
00:20:41,225 --> 00:20:42,058
Buckle up.

395
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,868
[Payton] Hey, what's the big idea?

396
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,138
Did you eat cake already?

397
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,158
I just had a cupcake.

398
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,538
Oh.

399
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,148
Well, how was it, kid?

400
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,798
It was good. We had chips and cookies.

401
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,153
Did you learn anything new?

402
00:20:58,155 --> 00:20:59,968
- [sighs]
- Not really.

403
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,358
Okay, once we get home, you
really need to change this.

404
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,838
I'm ready.

405
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,428
You know, I mean, you're
not going to wear this.

406
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,261
Why don't you put the dress?

407
00:21:08,263 --> 00:21:10,718
I don't want to wear
that raggedy old dress.

408
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,898
It doesn't even look nice on me.

409
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,300
Dad promised me he'd take
me to get a new dress.

410
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,958
Well, we all knew it
was not going to happen,

411
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,910
so I guess we're just going to make do.

412
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,875
[car starts up]

413
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:29,560

[Payton] Lily.

416
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:52,615
- Mommy, let me out.
- One second.

417
00:21:52,617 --> 00:21:54,661
- Mommy.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

418
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:56,727
[Lily] Mommy!

419
00:21:56,729 --> 00:21:58,398
- Let me out!
- Come on.

420
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,098
- Liliana stop.
- Sugarface.

421
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,273
[Payton] Quit whining.

422
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,053
You quit whining.

423
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,738
[Nicole] Don't start, you guys.

424
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,028
Lily, you shouldn't be whining.

425
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,573
I'm not whining, you're whining.

426
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,415
Let's go.
[Payton sighs]

427
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:15,707
Okay.

428
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:19,815
- So excited to eat cake.
- You already had a cupcake.

429
00:22:19,817 --> 00:22:22,294
[Lily] I want 10 slices.

430
00:22:22,296 --> 00:22:24,879
[upbeat music]

431
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:33,600
Whoa, mom.

432
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,568
You did such an awesome
job, this is so cool.

433
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,958
- You like it?
- I love it.

434
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,928
- Thanks, mom.
- Aww.

435
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,645
You're welcome.

436
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:44,458
- I helped.
- Thanks, Lily.

437
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,888
Can I help with anything?

438
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,348
No, just go get dressed, honey.

439
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,538
Okay, mom.

440
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,538
Your dress is on the bed.

441
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,558
I know how much you love it.

442
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,028
I'm calling dad.

443
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,527
He promised me a new one.

Yes, I know.

447
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,463
Of course I did.

448
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,618
Hold on a second. It's my kid.

449
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,453
Yeah.

450
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,798
Payton, what's up?

451
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,844
Dad, you promised me you'd
take me to get a new dress.

452
00:23:23,846 --> 00:23:25,963
Payton, Payton, Payton, calm down.

453
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,618
I got a surprise for you when I get home.

454
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,543
You always have to go.

455
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,643
Yes I do. [laughs]

Not today.

He should be here soon, Pay.

470
00:24:23,697 --> 00:24:25,364
Don't count on it.

471
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,421
Don't worry, hun.

472
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:30,563

to be like last year.

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,093
Later, man.

What's up, Pay?

480
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,423
Payton.

481
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:11,723
Pay, what's wrong?

482

You okay?

00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,243
Okay...

485
00:25:34,628 --> 00:25:35,854

[Nicole sighs]

487
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:39,218
She doesn't think your
dad's going to make it.

488
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,904
Come on, he'll be here.

489
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,108
I know he will.

490
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,413
Go tell her that. She
really needs to get ready.

491
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,220
Her friends will be here soon.

492
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,358
All right.

493
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
I'll go talk to her.

Stop it!

498
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:11,918
Leave me alone, Mike.

499
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,438
Come on. You gotta get
ready for your party.

500
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,768
I am ready.

501
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,178
You're going to wear
this to your own party?

502
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,330
What's wrong with it?

503
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,828
I just, I don't know. I
thought you could do better.

504
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,868
I'm not wearing that ugly dress.

505
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,073
I told mom five times.

506
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,202
Okay, what do you want to wear?

507
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:31,993
This doofus. Why can't I wear this?

508
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:35,198
I mean you can, but, you
kind of look like a foot.

509
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,213
Ugh. I'm going inside.

510
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,234
Yeah, while you're at it,

511
00:26:41,236 --> 00:26:42,067
why don't you go brush your teeth

512
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:44,848
with some poppy seeds and broccoli, huh?

513
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,683
You stink.

514
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,558
What do you think you're doing?

515
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,760
Going to go get ready.

516
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,258
Do you need help?

517
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,093
No.

518
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,913
Lily, where are you?

519
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:09,738
[Lily] Hiding!

520
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,073
Oh, Mike's going to come and find you.

521
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,133
Hello?

522
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,123
Is anyone there?

523
00:27:23,204 --> 00:27:25,753

Hey.

529
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,318
So I talked to dad earlier

530
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,118
and he said that if he wasn't back in time

531
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,818
for you to go ahead and
give Payton her gift.

532
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,208
What is it, mommy?

533
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:16,508
I don't really know
what he's talking about.

534
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,933
He said it's in the closet.

535
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,481
[soft, upbeat music]

536
00:28:47,608 --> 00:28:48,439
Not there!

537
00:28:48,441 --> 00:28:50,488
What am I even looking for?

538
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,543
I can ask him.

539
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,893
Check my closet.

540
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:58,359
[soft, upbeat music]

541
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:09,022

[Payton screams]

545
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,013
What is it?

546
00:29:25,362 --> 00:29:26,763
[Nicole] Why are you yelling?

547
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,127
What's wrong?

548
00:29:29,129 --> 00:29:30,509
What is it?

549
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:31,342
[Michael laughs]

550
00:29:31,344 --> 00:29:33,228
I can't believe it.

551
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,098
Wow.

552
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,108
That's really nice.

553
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,628
Did he pick that out by himself?

554
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,833
Actually, no.

555
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:43,678
We went to Manhattan a few months ago.

556
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,730
I remember I saw this dress in the window.

557
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:47,563
I stopped to admire it

558
00:29:47,565 --> 00:29:50,358
and my breath fogged up all the windows.

559
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,671
I remember telling him
how pretty it looked.

560
00:29:53,673 --> 00:29:54,873
That's so nice of him.

561
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,208
You like it, Mike?

562
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,041
I love it.

563
00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:00,056
And now you won't smell like a foot.

564
00:30:00,058 --> 00:30:01,958
[laughing]

565
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,056
Good one.

566
00:30:03,058 --> 00:30:04,078
Oh.

567
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,848
Well, I should call him to say sorry.

568
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:08,828
For what?

569
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,091
I said some pretty mean
things to him earlier.

570
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:11,926
Oh.

571
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,423
Go get dressed.

572
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,118
Go put it on.

573
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,953
Okay.

574
00:30:24,682 --> 00:30:27,691
Come on. [chuckles]

575
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:30,276
[somber music]

576
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,390
Man...

577
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:46,048
She is never going to understand this.

578
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,818
Oh, I'm going to be in the doghouse

579
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,882
so much with my little baby.

580
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:53,408
Oh, come on, man. Don't do that.

581
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,348
No, no, no, no, no.

582
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,083
Don't roam on me.

583
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,023
Roaming, roaming.

584
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,047
Roaming.

585
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:03,849
[doorbell chimes]

586
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:05,998
Pay, come get the door.

587
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,493
Your friends are here.

588
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,990
[Guests] Happy birthday!

589
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,811
[Payton] Come in.

590
00:31:14,813 --> 00:31:15,978
[Child] Yay!

591
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,813
Hi guys.

592
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,530
Son of a...

593
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,273
Hello!

594
00:31:24,124 --> 00:31:26,607
[panting]

595
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:29,648
[doorbell chimes]
[children chattering]

596
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,483
Hey guys, come on in.

597
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:33,742
Come, this way.

598
00:31:35,077 --> 00:31:36,678
[Payton] Come on, we're playing tag.

599
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,448
- You're it.
- Thank you guys.

600
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,423
See you later.

601
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,424
I can take it.

602
00:31:42,426 --> 00:31:43,259
Thank you.

603
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:48,048
Okay.

604
00:31:49,882 --> 00:31:52,773
Lesson in cool. Gotta be cool.

605
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:55,933
Gotta be really cool.

606
00:31:55,935 --> 00:31:57,918
[sighs]

607
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,751
When you were a little boy,

608
00:31:58,753 --> 00:32:02,936
all the lights went out in
New York, remember? [laughs]

609
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:05,174
All those people stuck in elevators.

610
00:32:05,176 --> 00:32:07,542
That was such a mess.

611
00:32:07,544 --> 00:32:09,877
Oh, man, I do not like this.

612
00:32:10,982 --> 00:32:12,982
[sighs]

613
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:17,208
Oh man.

614
00:32:19,644 --> 00:32:24,644
[upbeat music]
[children shouting]

615
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:52,264
- Time out!
- That's it, that's it.

616
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:54,766
[Roman sighs]

617
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:07,568
[children chattering]

618
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:13,056
[phone ringing]

619
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,298
Hello?

620
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,493
May I speak to Roman?

621
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,208
No, sorry. I left the office early.

622
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,653
Oh, um, good.

623
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,858
You know, it's Payton's birthday

624
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,748
and the kids are already here.

625
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,400
He was supposed to pick up pizza.

626
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,018
I would imagine he'd be
home any minute, though.

627
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,428
He was just finishing up the reports.

628
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,263
Okay.

629
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:41,983
Thank you.

630
00:33:44,418 --> 00:33:47,001
[Nicole sighs]

631
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,518
Mike.

632
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,670
Come here for a second.

633
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,228
What's up?

634
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,158
I can't find your father.

635
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,988
What do you mean you can't find him?

636
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,520
I tried calling him. He's not answering.

637
00:34:09,522 --> 00:34:12,070
Well that doesn't surprise me.

638
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,778
I talked to his secretary,
and I did the math.

639
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,623
He was supposed to be here hours ago.

640
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,253
Well did you check traffic?

641
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,453
No, you didn't.

642
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:28,333
[children shouting]

643
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,103
Traffic is backed up. See?

644
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,290
I don't know what to do.

645
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,652
Did you call his garage?

646
00:34:39,694 --> 00:34:42,998
I don't know. I have no
idea where he parks his car.

647
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,103
You can Google it.

648
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,298
Okay. Mr. Tech.

649
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,848
I'll call 'em.

650
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,949
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

651
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,150
I'll watch the kids.

652
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,913
Kids, no climbing the tree.

653
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,480
Turn on the lights!

654
00:35:05,518 --> 00:35:06,351
I'm stuck!

655
00:35:14,518 --> 00:35:17,601
[children shouting]

656
00:35:17,603 --> 00:35:19,603
No, it's my dad's car.

657
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:24,068
Uh, the license plate, um...

658
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,315
Do you know dad's license plate number?

659
00:35:26,317 --> 00:35:27,268
Mm...

660
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,103
One second.

661
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,000
Okay. It is DMA...

662
00:35:39,044 --> 00:35:40,563
1924.

663
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,913
Yeah, black, correct.

664
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,223
Oh.

665
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,583
He's checking.

666
00:35:50,342 --> 00:35:54,675
[children shouting in the distance]

667
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,408
Yes.

668
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,400
Um...

669
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,583
Okay.

670
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,868
Thank you.

671
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:06,703
You, too.

672
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,033
It's not his.

673
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,853
Try another?

674
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,420
Yeah.

675
00:36:15,422 --> 00:36:17,970
- Please Mike.
- We can keep tryin' 'em.

676
00:36:17,972 --> 00:36:19,498
I'm going to go take care of the kids.

677
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,333
Okay.

678
00:36:22,518 --> 00:36:26,935
[children shouting in the distance]

679
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,788
Hi. Yeah, um, I'm looking
for my dad's vehicle.

680
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,313
It is a black Discovery.

681
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,033

Oh, man.

Oh man.

690
00:37:30,371 --> 00:37:32,015
Oh no.

691
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:32,850
Oh no.

00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,720
Hello, this is James.

700
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,858
Hi, yeah.

701
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,228
My name is Michael Juniper.

702
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,108
I'm looking for my father's vehicle.

703
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,568
I'm sorry. I can't give
out that information.

704
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,401
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

705
00:38:15,403 --> 00:38:16,328
My dad's missing, okay?

706
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,708
He was supposed to be home hours ago

707
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,853
for my sister's birthday and
he still hasn't showed up.

708
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,378
Okay. What's his plate number?

709
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,140
The plate number. It's um...

710
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,504
It's, I have it somewhere.

711
00:38:30,506 --> 00:38:31,339
Hold on, hold on.

712
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,753
Hey, kid.

713
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,688
Did you eat lunch today?

714
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,663
What does that have to do with anything?

715
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,048
Some guy gave me a bag of lunch

716
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,700
and it had a birthday card in it.

717
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,338
Yes. That is his car.

718
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,368
I forgot my lunch in my
dad's car this morning.

719
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,588
That's this car, right?

720
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,840
I honestly can't give
you that information.

721
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,468
It's a black Discovery, okay?

722
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,108
Is it his car or not?

723
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,323
Yes, it's here.

724
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,748
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

725
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,583
And...

726
00:39:04,555 --> 00:39:05,598
[sighs]

727
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,528
Can you just tell him that his family

728
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,298
is worried about him if you see him?

729
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,853
I can do that. No problem.

730
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,707

00:39:22,673 --> 00:39:25,256
[somber music]

732
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,508
Excuse me, sir.

733
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,358
What happened over here?

734
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,593
We've got a single
car traffic collision.

735
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,438
Who was it? Anybody injured?

736
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,840
I can't tell you his name.

737
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,308
Do you know if it was Roman?

738
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,448
I can't tell you his name.

739
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,600
All right. Thank you.

740
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:52,805
It's gonna a long night.

741
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,198
But we gotta do what we gotta do

742
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,938
and it's bad enough that
we're here and that we s-

743
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,183
- Excuse me, officers?

744
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,048
What's going on over here?

745
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,433
Texting and driving,
dude. We see it every day.

746
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,548
Was there anybody hurt?

747
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:10,373
We're not authorized to give
you that information, sir.

748
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,454
We can't help you with that, sir.

749
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:12,478
I need you to stay behind the line, okay?

750
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,247
Is it male or female?

751
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,598
We can't give you that information.

752
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,518
We're in no position to do that, sir.

753
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,703
It'd be best for you to
just move along, okay?

754
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,120
All right. Thanks.

We got to go, mom.

00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,158
Go where?

771
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,708
To his office. He's gotta be there.

772
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,068
What are we going to
do with all the kids?

773
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,408
Fine, I'll just go.

774
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,918
No way, Mike. You just got your permit.

775
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,763
You can't drive without supervision.

776
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,058
Besides, it's going to take you two hours

777
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,328
to get to Manhattan at this point.

778
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:13,103
Okay? What do you want to do?

779
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:15,983
I don't know.

780
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,633
Fine.

781
00:42:19,481 --> 00:42:20,881
- I'll call the cops.
- Wait.

782
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,553
Relax.

783
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,578
Let me call.

784
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,998
You're going to upset your sisters.

785
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,143
She's already upset.

787
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,778
Would you please just
go get some pizzas?

788
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,208
Get four pies.

794
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,205
Do you need police, fire or ambulance?

795
00:42:48,207 --> 00:42:49,658
No, my husband is missing.

796
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,098
He was supposed to be home hours ago.

797
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,788
He's not answering his phone.

798
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,108
[911 Operator] Ma'am, this does not

799
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,028
seem like an emergency.

800
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,861
I'm sorry.

801
00:42:57,863 --> 00:43:00,968
We called his parking garage
and his car is still there.

802
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,613
[911 Operator] Maybe he's working late?

803
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,369
I truly believe there's something wrong.

804
00:43:06,371 --> 00:43:10,270
[911 Operator] What's the
physical address of this office?

805
00:43:10,272 --> 00:43:12,605
It's 121 West 38th Street.

806
00:43:14,097 --> 00:43:14,928
[911 Operator] Did you call his office?

807
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:18,128
I called the office and
everybody left for the day.

808
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,148
[911 Operator] Could he be running late-

809
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,958
- No, ma'am he was supposed
to be here hours ago.

810
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,188
[911 Operator] Are you positive

811
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,608
he was coming straight home?

812
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,648
Yes, ma'am.

813
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,788
[911 Operator] It's a bit
early to file a police report,

814
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,515
but if you don't hear
from him by tomorrow,

815
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:33,352
you can call us back.

817
00:43:37,947 --> 00:43:39,165
What'd they say?

818
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:42,865
They said it's too early
to report a missing person.

819
00:43:42,867 --> 00:43:43,868
- [sighs]
- He's not missing.

820
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,498
What don't they get about that?

821
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,358
Mom, something is wrong.

822
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,968
He called me today and he never does that.

He called you?

00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,041
Yeah.

825
00:43:50,043 --> 00:43:52,498
I was at track practice
and I got a FaceTime

826
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,898
from a really strange number.

827
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,348
It was him just trying
to figure out the app,

828
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,113
but I had to go.

829
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:00,430

He didn't answer.

867
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:22,853
Why would he do this to me?

00:46:24,432 --> 00:46:26,529

You've just got to realize dad's busy.

874
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,818
And his secretary left work early today

875
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,920
so he was even busier.

876
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,870
Hey, he's going to be here.

877
00:47:04,951 --> 00:47:07,088

go and enjoy your party.

Are you kidding me?

00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:24,238
You make the best banana
pancakes I've ever had.

[soft piano music]

918
00:50:21,093 --> 00:50:22,593
[Mike] You guys.

919
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:28,848
You think you can just
disappear for a week

920
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:31,373
and show up like nothing has happened?

921
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:38,287
[door slams]

922
00:50:38,289 --> 00:50:40,789
[tense music]

923
00:50:51,512 --> 00:50:53,372
[Roman grunts]

924
00:50:53,374 --> 00:50:54,207
Hello?

925
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,899
Hello...

926
00:50:56,901 --> 00:50:57,734
Man.

927
00:50:59,421 --> 00:51:04,421
[somber music]
[Roman groaning]

928
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:06,672
Oh.

929
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:23,671
Oh, wow.

930
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:27,559
[sighs]

931
00:51:28,471 --> 00:51:31,054
[somber music]

932
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:42,558
Ugh.

933
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,635
God.

934
00:51:43,637 --> 00:51:44,470
No.

935
00:51:47,365 --> 00:51:49,948
[somber music]

936
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,122
Oh.

937
00:52:06,796 --> 00:52:09,118
[somber music]

938
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,951
It is so important to associate yourself

939
00:52:11,953 --> 00:52:16,158
with people who will encourage you.

940
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,348
Life is not about competing
against each other

941
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:22,053
like in track, but
competing against yourself.

942
00:52:22,907 --> 00:52:24,918
Who you were yesterday.

943
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,603
What is life really about?

944
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:28,553
Life is about money?

945
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:34,628
No.

946
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:37,647
You taught me that life is about family.

947
00:52:46,106 --> 00:52:49,856
I've tried to make it
home for dinner, but...

948
00:52:51,276 --> 00:52:53,943
[Roman mumbles]

949
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,473
So by the time I arrive,

950
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:04,370
you've already stopped wondering

951
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,990
if I'm gonna make it in time.

952
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:14,063
And the anger begins to set in.

953
00:53:19,758 --> 00:53:24,758
What's important...
[sniffles]

954
00:53:27,645 --> 00:53:29,228
What's important...

955
00:53:34,273 --> 00:53:37,237
Is what you make of your life

956
00:53:39,048 --> 00:53:42,297
and the happiness, underline happiness,

957
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:44,603
is what you bring.

958
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:49,393
The happiness you bring to it.

959
00:53:51,885 --> 00:53:52,802
Absolutely.

960
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:57,336
[somber music]

961
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:08,036
[cellphone buttons beeping]

962
00:54:14,495 --> 00:54:16,915
[phone ringing]

963
00:54:16,917 --> 00:54:17,750
Hello?

964
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:20,653
Hello?

965
00:54:36,138 --> 00:54:38,471
[knocking]

966
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,348
Hi. I'm here for the party.

967
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:43,598
Where's the birthday girl?

968
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,108
Oh, uh, hi.

969
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:46,953
Um, she's inside.

970
00:54:48,943 --> 00:54:51,608
Do you mind to keep them busy
before you start the show?

971
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:54,248
We're waiting for their
father to come home.

972
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,898
Sure. I'll take 'em outside
and I'll show 'em some stuff.

973
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,928
Excuse me. Are you hungry?

974
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:00,758
Do you want some pizza?

975
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,993
That's okay. I'm good.

976
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:04,708
Oh, thank you so much.

977
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:07,145
Kids, come outside.

978
00:55:07,147 --> 00:55:10,147
[children shouting]

979
00:55:11,662 --> 00:55:13,065
- Hi.
- Hi.

980
00:55:13,067 --> 00:55:14,317
Come, Payton.

981
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:16,823
Hi.

982
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:21,057
[children chattering]

983
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,798
Hi Payton. I'm Mary.

984
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,243
I brought you a special
unicorn hoop today.

985
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,891
Can I teach you some cool tricks?

986
00:55:30,893 --> 00:55:32,893
That would be so cool.

987
00:55:34,421 --> 00:55:37,671
[children chattering]

988
00:55:40,715 --> 00:55:42,897
Man, come on...

989
00:55:42,899 --> 00:55:45,482
[somber music]

990
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:50,014
[Roman sighs]

991
00:55:54,365 --> 00:55:57,112
[Roman chuckles]

992
00:55:57,114 --> 00:55:58,364
My little baby.

993
00:56:04,707 --> 00:56:07,358
Now there were times I've
gotten alone in the big city,

994
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,313
but you were always there for me.

995
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,733
I was afraid I wasn't
good enough for you, so,

996
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:20,123
I did the only thing I knew how. [sighs]

997
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:24,212
Oh man.

998
00:56:26,692 --> 00:56:29,275
[somber music]

999
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:48,883
Yay.

1000
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,248
But I would like to tell you, Nicole,

1001
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:58,073
I love you more than
life itself. [sobbing]

1002
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,383
Oh, Nicole.

1003
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,570
My intention...

1004
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:24,570
My intention...

1005
00:57:26,628 --> 00:57:27,998
[sobbing]

1006
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
My intention was to keep our
family safe and happy, always.

1007
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,988
I am blessed.

1008
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:47,570
I am blessed and happy

1009
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:54,138
to have all of my family together.

1010
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:57,023
To have all of my family together.

1011
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:03,053
Please tell Payton, please tell Payton

1012
00:58:03,055 --> 00:58:04,984
I tried to get there today.

1013
00:58:04,986 --> 00:58:07,745
Just tell her. [sobbing]

1014
00:58:07,747 --> 00:58:11,164
[soft, mysterious music]

1015
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:10,758
[phone ringing]

1016
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,118
Hello?

1017
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,168
Excuse me, is Michael there?

1018
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,488
Who is this?

1019
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,003
He called my garage earlier.

1020
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,028
Did you find the car?

1021
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,598
Ma'am, his car is parked here.

1022
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,628
I can't give you any more information.

1023
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:27,163
If you give me his address,
I could probably help.

1024
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,098
What makes you want to help us?

1025
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,713
He fed me lunch earlier today.

1026
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:33,818
Lunch?

1027
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,928
With a nice birthday card inside.

1028
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:37,508
It's my birthday, too.

1029
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:38,923
How did you get my number?

1030
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,008
Michael Juniper gave it to me.

1031
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,408
What's your name?

1032
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:46,408
Ma'am, I spoke with a police officer.

1033
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:47,523
There was an accident.

1034
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:51,578
A truck crashed into a utility box.

1035
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,818
Only one man was injured,

1036
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,985
but they wouldn't tell me
what hospital he was in.

1037
00:59:55,987 --> 00:59:58,428
Did you get any other information?

1038
00:59:58,430 --> 00:59:59,263
No.

1039
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:04,528
Okay, I'm an hour and a
half away from the city.

1040
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:07,428
I have 20 kids running around the house.

1041
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:08,828
Would you please give me your number

1042
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:10,730
in case you get any other information?

1043
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:15,723
Okay.

1044
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:19,643
Okay.

1045
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,133
Thank you.

1046
01:00:24,655 --> 01:00:27,238
[somber music]

1047
01:00:34,867 --> 01:00:36,134
Mike.

1048
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:36,967
[Mike] Yeah, yeah, what's wrong?

1049
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:38,481
The garage just called.

1050
01:00:38,483 --> 01:00:40,018
There was an accident on your dad's block.

1051
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:40,851
Are you serious?

1052
01:00:40,853 --> 01:00:43,208
We need to call the hospital
that's in the vicinity.

1053
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:45,793
I'll call 'em, I'll call 'em.

1054
01:00:47,218 --> 01:00:50,578
[doorbell chimes]

1055
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,548
Hey. How's it going?

1056
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:54,178
Sorry we're late.

1057
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:57,302
Hope we didn't miss the festivities...

1058
01:00:57,304 --> 01:00:59,753
Dhruv, go find Payton. Give her her gift.

1059
01:01:03,432 --> 01:01:05,670
What's wrong, Nic? What's wrong?

1060
01:01:05,672 --> 01:01:06,738
Roman hasn't called back.

1061
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,248
Okay...

1062
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,688
We've tried everybody,
we even tried the cops.

1063
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:12,533
Okay, calm down.

1064
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:14,668
[Nicole sobs]

1065
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:16,718
The man called and said that there was

1066
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,011
an accident on his block and maybe...

1067
01:01:19,013 --> 01:01:20,318
Slow down.

1068
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,478
Maybe he got tired and he took a nap

1069
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,428
or something in the office.

1070
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,758
Yeah, I'd like to think that, but...

1071
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,660
I highly doubt it.

1072
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:30,968
Well what can I do?

1073
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:32,370
I can stay here if you want.

1074
01:01:34,721 --> 01:01:35,552
I don't even know.

1075
01:01:35,554 --> 01:01:37,599
I have 20 kids running around

1076
01:01:37,601 --> 01:01:42,348
and by the time I get to
Manhattan, it's rush hour, so...

1077
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:45,558
I'll entertain the
heck out of these kids.

1078
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,030
Don't worry, he's going to be fine.

1079
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:51,943
Okay.

1080
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,582
Mike.

1081
01:01:54,584 --> 01:01:57,167
I'll meet you at the car, okay?

1082
01:01:59,086 --> 01:02:03,419
[children shouting in the distance]

1083
01:02:04,928 --> 01:02:07,511
[somber music]

1084
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,038
Baby, come on, let's take a ride.

1085
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,832
Can I bring my dolls?

1086
01:02:12,834 --> 01:02:13,665
Yes.

1087
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:17,278
Uh, Payton, I'll be back. I
have to pick up dad at work.

1088
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,378
Still?

1089
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:20,778
Yeah, he had car trouble.

1090
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,978
Do you want to, you want to come with us

1091
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,088
or you want to stay with your friends?

1092
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:27,703
Well, we already sang
happy birthday in school.

1093
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,877
I think you should come.

1094
01:02:32,037 --> 01:02:36,454
[children shouting in the distance]

1095
01:02:42,377 --> 01:02:46,178
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather around and come see

1096
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:48,708
the famous hula hoop toss.

1097
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:49,698
Let's go, let's go.

1098
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:50,637
Come on, girls.

1099
01:02:54,533 --> 01:02:55,547
[Nicole] Buckle up.

1100
01:02:55,549 --> 01:02:56,882
[Payton] Okay.

1101
01:02:58,106 --> 01:03:00,026
[Lily] Take my doll, Payton.

1102
01:03:00,028 --> 01:03:00,914
[Payton] I can't.

1103
01:03:00,916 --> 01:03:02,248
- Got the keys?
- Yeah.

1104
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,827
[Payton] Mommy, what's happening?

1105
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:05,531
[Nicole] It's okay, baby.

1106
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:07,403
One second.
[car starts up]

1107
01:03:07,405 --> 01:03:08,738
Are you buckled?

1108
01:03:10,107 --> 01:03:12,607
[tense music]

1109
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:22,708
[Roman] I took out a
life insurance policy

1110
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:25,623
a few months ago for $1 million.

1111
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,948
Kindly collect the money,
pay off the mortgage.

1112
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:34,028
There's still 120,000 to pay off.

1113
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:37,308
Use the rest to pay for
college and art supplies.

1114
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:39,813
Get back and in touch
with that side of you.

1115
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:50,188
I know when you became a
mom, man, you gave up a lot.

1116
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:51,540
Please forgive me for that.

1117
01:03:54,517 --> 01:03:57,017
[tense music]

1118
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:03,870
[honking]

1119
01:04:07,117 --> 01:04:08,698
Mom, mom.

1120
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:09,531
Mom?

1121
01:04:09,533 --> 01:04:10,498
Hey.

1122
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,408
Hey, hey. He's gotta be
at this hospital, okay?

1123
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:15,438
It's right down the
street from his office.

1124
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,490
Okay, uh...

1125
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,435
What don't you put the GPS and uh,

1126
01:04:19,437 --> 01:04:20,508
try to use the app.

1127
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:23,368
You know, the new one. It
gives you the best directions.

1128
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:26,323
Wait a minute. Why isn't dad at work?

1129
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,900
He, um...

1130
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,618
Just take a left here, okay?

1131
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,148
- I'm finding the directions.
- Okay.

1132
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:36,983
Let's go.

1133
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:44,463
[Roman] Nicole, by the
time you find this letter,

1134
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:48,740
I'm not sure if I'll still be here.

1135
01:04:50,501 --> 01:04:53,001
[tense music]

1136
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:08,908
Mike, please stay in the car.

1137
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:11,538
Call the parking garage and
see if there's any updates.

1138
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,313
- Got it.
- Please watch the kids, okay?

1139
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,868
My husband is missing.

1140
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:30,701
There was an accident.

1141
01:05:30,703 --> 01:05:32,008
I have a strong reason to believe

1142
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:33,628
he was admitted to this hospital.

1143
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:34,463
Name?

1144
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,068
Roman Juniper.

1145
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:38,668
When was he admitted?

1146
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:40,873
I'm not sure. I'm his wife.

1147
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:46,643
Hi, I'm looking for a Roman Juniper.

1148
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,753
Okay.

1149
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,603
We have no one by that
name here at the moment.

1150
01:05:56,389 --> 01:05:57,220
Is there any way to
check if he was admitted

1151
01:05:57,222 --> 01:05:58,833
to a different hospital?

1152
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:02,028
What type of accident?

1153
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:03,143
It was a car crash.

1154
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:06,499
Okay.

1155
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:09,343
Yes.

1156
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:11,333
Can you please track?

1157
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:16,786
[phone line beeping]

1158
01:06:16,788 --> 01:06:19,048
All right you guys, um, I'm
gonna go check on mom, okay?

1159
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:19,881
Stay here.

1160
01:06:19,883 --> 01:06:20,714
- Mike?
- What?

1161
01:06:20,716 --> 01:06:21,643
I'm scared.

1162
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:23,631
All right, you guys can come.

1163
01:06:23,633 --> 01:06:24,466
Come on, let's go.

1164
01:06:26,972 --> 01:06:28,123
Come on, fast, fast, fast.

1165
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:38,428
Juniper?

1166
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:39,263
Right here.

1167
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:45,488
They brought a man in earlier.

1168
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:47,098
He doesn't have identification,

1169
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,258
but he fits your husband's description.

1170
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:51,878
Are there any marks on his body

1171
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,518
so that we could identify him?

1172
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:58,520
Um, yes, he has a birthmark
inside his right ankle.

1173
01:06:59,060 --> 01:06:59,893
Okay.

1174
01:07:03,868 --> 01:07:05,518
Is he okay?

1175
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,970
He's in critical condition.

1176
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,093
When the truck hit, it
punctured his right lung.

1177
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,470
That's not him.

1178
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:19,838
I hope not.

1179
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,338
He always has his wallet om him.

1180
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,118
He had nothing on him at all?

1181
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,668
No.

1182
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:25,503
Nothing.

1183
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,378
Well can you find out?

1184
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:29,563
I am. I will.

1185
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,680
It's okay, girls. It's okay.

1186
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,399
I'm sorry.

1187
01:07:37,401 --> 01:07:38,509
- Mommy?
- It's okay.

1188
01:07:38,511 --> 01:07:40,838
- Where's daddy?
- He's okay, it's not him.

1189
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,190
[Nurse] Hang out and
we'll look for it, okay?

1190
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:49,353

charge of the eBay account.

If you would like to
shut down my company...

1197
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:28,003
That's up to you.

1198
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:32,639
I don't want to burden you with that.

1199
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:37,773
I love you.

1200
01:08:40,994 --> 01:08:45,813

to his next competition.

Lily, she is your twin.

She's your twin.

Oh, that Lily, she's my

1206
01:09:18,809 --> 01:09:19,788
Excuse me.

1207
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:20,838
Yes?

1208
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:23,528
Hi, I was called recently
about a missing person

1209
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:25,348
and the family's really worried.

1210
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:27,798
I'm concerned they might be
in this building right here.

1211
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,807
Just stay calm.

1212
01:09:28,809 --> 01:09:31,174
If there's someone in
there, we'll find 'em.

1213
01:09:31,176 --> 01:09:32,658
I'm going to talk to the chief.

1214
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,727
- Okay.
- I'll be right back, okay?

1215
01:09:33,729 --> 01:09:34,561
All right.

1216
01:09:34,563 --> 01:09:35,773
- Thank you.
- Hey chief.

1217
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:38,948
This man says he's got a
friend stuck in the building.

1218
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:40,918
Should I gather up the guys and go inside?

1219
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,548
Let me notify 'em.

1220
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:43,958
Command to all units, be advised,

1221
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,408
we have a report of a person
stuck inside the building.

Please initiate procedures.

1223

the guys and head inside.

Hey, how you doin'? I
just talked to the chief.

1228

Just remain calm.

and we're headed inside very shortly.

1231

Okay, great. Is there anything I can do?

Never leave your work pending.

1238

When then you start
something, you must finish it.

in this family.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down.

1277
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:47,371
Calm down.

1278
01:13:47,373 --> 01:13:48,608
Don't you tell me to calm down.

1279
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:50,428
My husband, Roman, where is he?

1280
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:52,278
- Did you say Roman?
- Roman Juniper.

1281
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:56,158
Okay, he was stuck in
the elevator a few hours.

1282
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,633
He's unconscious. He's on
his way to the hospital.

1283
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:00,461
On his way to Central Hospital.

1284
01:14:00,463 --> 01:14:01,887
- Which-
- Central Hospital

1285
01:14:01,889 --> 01:14:03,438
in the middle of town.

1286
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,625
- These are his belongings.
- Are you okay, ma'am?

1287
01:14:05,627 --> 01:14:06,952
[Payton sobbing]

1288
01:14:06,954 --> 01:14:09,223
Here are his belongings.

1289
01:14:09,225 --> 01:14:11,146
Is my daddy all right?

1290
01:14:11,148 --> 01:14:12,751
He's gonna be find, sweetheart.

1291
01:14:12,753 --> 01:14:14,695
- Why do you have his stuff?
- You need to take this.

1292
01:14:14,697 --> 01:14:15,528
It's what was left in the elevator.

1293
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:16,378
What is this?

1294
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:20,126
You need to head to the hospital.

1295
01:14:20,128 --> 01:14:21,358
Let's go, Mike. Come on, guys.

1296
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,498
We have to be strong for your daddy.

1297
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,598
Come on.
[Payton sobbing]

1298
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,030
Come on.

1299
01:14:26,032 --> 01:14:26,863
[Mike] Give me the key.

1300
01:14:26,865 --> 01:14:28,765
I'll drive, I'm driving.

1301
01:14:28,767 --> 01:14:30,378
Come on, girls.

1306
01:15:18,487 --> 01:15:21,606
[Nicole] Mike, open the door.

1307
01:15:21,608 --> 01:15:24,525
Let's go. Come on, Payton, come on.

1308
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:34,238
Mrs. Juniper, you're back.

1309
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,378
Yes, my husband, Roman, was brought in.

1310
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:38,498
He was stuck on the elevator.

1311
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,088
Roman Juniper?

1312
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:41,023
Let me check.

1313
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,728
Um, he's in ICU on the sixth floor.

1314
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:49,473
The elevator's just back there.

1315
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:51,251
Thanks.

1316
01:15:51,253 --> 01:15:52,787
Let's go, guys.

1317
01:15:52,789 --> 01:15:54,789
[Mike] Come on, girls.

1318
01:15:57,642 --> 01:16:02,642
[elevator beeping]
[soft, somber music]

1319
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:18,358
Hi, excuse me.

1320
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,307
My husband Roman Juniper
was admitted here.

1321
01:16:21,309 --> 01:16:22,488
What's going on?

1322
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:24,328
He's still unconscious.

1323
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:25,818
We're doing our best.

1324
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:28,688
He's suffering from idiopathic
ventricular fibrillation

1325
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:31,128
from the shock, but don't worry.

1326
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:33,378
He's getting the absolute best treatment.

1327
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,743
I will let you know as soon
as there is any update.

1328
01:16:38,496 --> 01:16:41,913
[soft, melancholy music]

1329
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:11,428
[Roman] There is never
enough time in the day.

1330
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:13,368
So much pressure on me and every day

1331
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:16,038
and the anger begins to set in.

1332
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,028
I took out a life insurance policy

1333
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:19,967
a few months ago for one...

1334
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:22,678
It is so important to associate yourself

1335
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,768
with people who will encourage you.

1336
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:30,628
You taught me that life is about family.

1337
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:33,188
I would like to tell you, Nicole,

1338
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,848
I love you more than life itself.

1339
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:40,277
My intention was to keep
our family safe and happy.

1340
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:42,887
I am blessed.

1341
01:17:42,889 --> 01:17:44,183
I am blessed.

1342
01:17:45,141 --> 01:17:46,518
Please tell Payton I tried to get there.

1343
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:49,303
Nicole, I know when you became a mom,

1344
01:17:50,425 --> 01:17:52,188
man, you have up a lot.

1345
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:54,398
Please forgive me for that.

1346
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,403
By the time you find this letter,

1347
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:00,710
I'm not sure if I'll still be here.

1348
01:18:03,223 --> 01:18:05,273
What's wrong, momma?

1349
01:18:06,366 --> 01:18:09,199
[Nicole sniffles]

1350
01:18:10,493 --> 01:18:11,393
It's okay.

1351
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:15,746
Your dad loved us very much.

1352
01:18:16,646 --> 01:18:20,763
He loves us and he gives
us the best he can, okay?

1353
01:18:22,046 --> 01:18:24,629
- Don't cry, momma.
- I'm okay.

1354
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,242
Dad's gonna be okay. I promise.

1355
01:18:31,244 --> 01:18:32,394
I know he'll be okay.

1356
01:18:34,212 --> 01:18:36,608
[Payton sobbing]

1357
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:37,443
Mike.

1358
01:18:38,616 --> 01:18:41,238
Could you please go get
us some snacks or...

1359
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,483
I'm really not hungry.

1360
01:18:43,364 --> 01:18:44,688
Mike, please.

1361
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:47,617
I don't know, get them, like muffins or...

1362
01:18:47,619 --> 01:18:50,967
- I'm kind of hungry.
- Thank you, Mike.

1363
01:18:50,969 --> 01:18:52,467
Yup.

1364
01:18:52,469 --> 01:18:53,303
Come on, girls.

1365
01:18:54,716 --> 01:18:55,549
Come on.

1366
01:18:57,816 --> 01:19:00,234
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

Start the levophed drip.

1372
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:52,346
It's not working.
We're going to lose him.

1373
01:19:52,348 --> 01:19:53,258
[doctor sighs]

1374
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:56,369
Go get his wife. He's
not going to survive.

1375
01:19:56,371 --> 01:19:57,205
Okay.

1376
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:05,213
Just you.

What's happening?

1380
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:21,733
What's going on?

1381
01:20:22,705 --> 01:20:23,538
I'm sorry.

1382
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:25,680
We couldn't save him.

Ms. Juniper.

1386
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:37,733
Wake up.

Wake up.

1390

- You're their only mom.
- Mom.

1391

Mom.

1392
01:20:47,835 --> 01:20:49,318
Mom.

1393
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,053
Mommy, wake up.

1394
01:20:52,785 --> 01:20:54,085
I brought you this muffin.

1395
01:20:55,162 --> 01:20:57,234
Thank you, Lily.

His blood pressure is
dropping dramatically.

1401

We can't lose him. We
need a levophed drip now.

01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:21,823
- Here, quick.
- Okay.

1403
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,158
His blood pressure's dropping again.

1404
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,067
If you pray, please pray for him.

1405

- No.
- No.

I don't know if you can hear me,

but I need you to wake up.

1428

I'll be whatever you want me to be.

I'll be a math teacher.
I'll get 100% on every test.

I don't need those stupid shoes.

I'll come in first every time without it,

1432

Make them go away.

like straight lines.
