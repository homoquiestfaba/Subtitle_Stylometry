1
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,114
I love this place, I really do.

2
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,278
It's a great place to hang your hat,
or lift your leg.

3
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,709
It's so me!

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,595
The bay breeze, the GoIden Gate,
Fisherman's Wharf,..

5
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,995
..the femaIes...

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,272
Yeah, don't even get this dog
started on the femaIes!

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,154
Just something about the way
a girI sips her Iatte..

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,993
..that gets me
a IittIe hot under the coIIar.

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,353
But enough about me.
Let's taIk about why we're here:

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,239
..the DoIittIes.

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,757
Maya DoIittIe is not the doctor,
the daughter.

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,352
You see, she's adjusting.

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,431
She's going through
that weird period..

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,194
..that every
one-in-a-triIIion girIs go through.

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,556
It's not every day
a young woman wakes up..

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,871
..and reaIizes she can taIk
to animaIs, and we can taIk to her.

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,875
I thought you said
you actuaIIy had your Iicense?

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,110
Just chiII out!
Everything's under controI now.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,430
Just don't kiII me
before the party tomorrow night!

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,875
I burned the dopest CD
for everyone to freak to.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,789
- Oh, my God, I just had
the best idea. - What?

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,554
You shouId totaIIy have a birthday
party at the end of summer,..

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,153
..and we'II make sure
it's off the chain,..

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,231
..and then you'II be part
of the ''A'' Iist with me!

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,756
I don't know how to teII you this,
but you've been more of a ''B'' IateIy.

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,477
Which wouId make me a ''C'' at best.

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,876
I am so hating
my sociaI status right now!

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,838
What do you expect? Running around
taIking to animaIs aII the time?

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,955
I toId you a miIIion times:

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,111
..I don't taIk to them,
they keep taIking to me!

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,713
- Maya, watch out!
- Oh, no!

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,509
What are you doing?!

33
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,512
What did you do that for, Iady?
I was gonna pee on that!

34
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,109
How bad?

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,269
Oh, no!

36
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,714
You drive Iike a freaking animaI!

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,440
Are you nuts?
You can get peopIe kiIIed Iike that!

38
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,750
Don't teII it to me,
teII it to the pig!

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,795
So I taIked to Heather,
who text-messaged Mandy,..

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,996
..who IM'd Christy,
who two-way'd with Tammy,..

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,072
..and the bottom Iine is we're both
invited to the party tonight!

42
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,753
Oh, my, God! You're the best!

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,753
So then I invited them
to your party at the end of summer.

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,919
- You did what?
- I didn't want to be rude.

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,275
Rude?

46
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,796
Rude is inviting somebody to a party
that doesn't even exist yet!

47
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,678
Look, do you want to be in or not?

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,319
So... Maya.

49
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,119
I hear you're having
a birthday party this summer...

50
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,837
Yes, and it wouId be so cooI
if aII of you guys came. I mean....

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,991
I assume you're having it
somewhere worthwhiIe?

52
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,630
- I don't reaIIy know yet, but....
- It's on a boat.

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,193
Like, on a rowboat?

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,678
ActuaIIy, it's on a huge,
P. Diddy-Iike boat.

55
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,749
How MTV of you!
We'II think about it.

56
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,431
A birthday party.
That is so freshman year!

57
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,356
They're so coming, I can feeI it!

58
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,430
You ready? We've got to go.
We got to heIp set up for Senior Day.

59
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,349
20 minutes, peopIe!

60
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,716
Hey, dude!
You roIIing to the jump off tonight?

61
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,757
- It's gonna be off the hook.
- Hi, CarI.

62
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,957
He nodded at me, did you see that?

63
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,031
Keep it up,
and he might actuaIIy taIk to you.

64
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,633
Nice shot,
you freaking moron!

65
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,199
Give the bird a break, dude!

66
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,998
What's with you
and that dumb thing?

67
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,674
I just feeI bad for him,
being Iocked up in a cage...

68
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,956
How do you feeI so bad for him?

69
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,796
How? The onIy person who has
the combination is PrincipaI Thomas.

70
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,916
Aw, jeez, it's 8-1 5-27!

71
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,835
Hey, guys,
maybe you shouId try 8-1 5-27.

72
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,235
Great!

73
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,279
The freak that taIks to animaIs.
Wait, Iet me guess:

74
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,237
..the hawk toId you the combo?

75
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,836
So, what if he did? You don't have
to be a jerk about it.

76
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,799
Go ahead then, CarI.
Let the bird out, I dare you.

77
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,272
AIright! Shake a taiI feather!

78
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,556
Oh, thanks a Iot, paI.
I'II be right back.

79
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,312
Ladies and gentIemen,
the hawk has Ieft the buiIding!

80
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,033
- Sweet.
- I owe you one.

81
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,156
There is Maya DoIittIe!

82
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,395
Anybody who is anybody
is gonna be there.

83
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,869
I even heard CarI caII it
''the party of the year''.

84
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,600
Parties? Ooh-Ia-Ia!
I Iove parties!

85
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,709
I'm sure you do.

86
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,873
- Now...
- Ooh, it's that kind of party!

87
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,235
- TeII me where it hurts.
- Okay, I'm ready.

88
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,994
So is the party
in the neighborhood?

89
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,756
CooI! Now I can see in coIor!

90
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,509
Oh, yes, definiteIy.
What do you think, Lucky?

91
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,229
I was thinking something,
you know, furrier.

92
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,755
I'm serious.
This party is as big as it gets.

93
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,114
You Iook great, kid!

94
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,118
We were Iistening to that!

95
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,589
I just got off the phone
with your principaI..

96
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,478
..and I saw
what you did to my car.

97
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,789
SmeIIs Iike troubIe...

98
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,190
Sounds Iike you had
an interesting afternoon.

99
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,318
Yeah, but it wasn't my fauIt.

100
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,074
I was trying to impress CarI,
and there was this bird...

101
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,357
I was 1 7 once, too, Maya.
I know what you're going through.

102
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,358
ReaIIy?
So animaIs chattered at you 24-7?

103
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,557
No, but I do know
what it's Iike to want to fit in.

104
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,996
Good. Then you know why I have
to finish getting ready for the party.

105
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,039
I'm sorry, sweetie,..

106
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,589
..but I think
you have earned yourseIf a night in.

107
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,113
But I thought you understood!

108
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,111
I've been working on this Iook
for hours!

109
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,157
Any Ionger,
I wouId've peed on the bed.

110
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,199
It's just one night.

111
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,392
But why does it have to be tonight?

112
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,279
''Where's Maya?'',
''Oh, she's at home, grounded!''

113
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,908
I might as weII teII everybody
you put me in a time-out.

114
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,911
I'm sure there'II be other parties.

115
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,549
Lucky, I need a favor.

116
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,440
Give me a bone and a beIIy rub,
and I'm your man.

117
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,274
Look, we were Iucky
even to get invited, right?

118
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,477
So I think the best approach
in a case Iike this is just..

119
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,957
..to keep a Iow profiIe.
- DefiniteIy, Iow pro aII the way.

120
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,670
Let's get
this party started, peopIe!

121
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,909
Sorry.
I guess I got a IittIe carried away.

122
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,598
We'II be Iucky if anybody
even taIks to us after that!

123
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,717
Speak for yourseIf, girIfriend!

124
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,357
I just wanted to say thanks
for taking the rap for me earIier.

125
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,312
PIease, it was...
totaIIy my pIeasure.

126
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,229
CooI. So you wanna dance?

127
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,835
Come on!

128
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,799
Charisse is fine, but I'm getting
reaIIy worried about Maya, John.

129
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,397
I know you had troubIe at first,
but you were a grown man.

130
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,593
Maya's a 1 7-year-oId girI
trying to figure Iife out.

131
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,800
You know what?
I think I might have an idea.

132
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,951
I'm gonna taIk to her
about it right now.

133
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,238
Maya, come down!

134
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,077
Hey, Maya, if you won't sing,
at Ieast come down and dance.

135
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,037
Viv! Low pro, remember?

136
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,959
Oh, forget that!
You're the best dancer here.

137
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,594
Step up, girI!

138
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,039
Come on, Maya, Iet's go!

139
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,360
What a doofus, and it's her wig!

140
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,555
Hey, girI!

141
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,109
- Is that CarI and Maya DoIittIe?
- Sure, he is.

142
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,958
What are you doing with her?

143
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,309
GirI, I'm grooving!

144
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,872
He must be out of his mind!

145
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,391
Hey, Justin,
turn around, check her out!

146
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,988
That dance is sick!

147
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,634
These moves are tight!

148
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,915
She's pretty good!

149
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,158
I toId you, girI!

150
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,953
Dr. Maya!
My butt is ready to rock and roII!

151
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,997
Let's get this party started,
peopIe!

152
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,553
Bombs away!

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,752
- What the...?
- Fire in the hoIe!

154
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,796
- Look out beIow!
- Is it haiIing? - I'm so bad!

155
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,756
Oh, no!
What is he doing here?

156
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,873
I'm popping, I'm Iocking,
I'm popping, I'm Iocking.

157
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,836
Go away! Get out of here! Shoo!

158
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,312
It's time to get my freak on.

159
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,075
Why are you doing this to me?
You'II ruin everything. Leave me aIone!

160
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,155
What?

161
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,553
We were just foIIowing you.

162
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,989
Here I come.
Monkey on the move!

163
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,038
Time to meet some Iadies!

164
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,397
This way to the bar, girIs!
It's Iadies night!

165
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,158
Is that what I think it is?

166
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,670
Check it out!
It's imported from France.

167
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,718
- You spiked the punch?
- Don't worry, it's good stuff.

168
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,150
- Wait! Is Maya taIking to it?
- Oh, no. - Who brought her anyway?

169
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,793
Has anyone seen my CD?

170
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,278
Au revoir, party poopers!

171
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,478
Come on, CarI, Iet's dance.

172
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,235
Look, just Ieave now,
and I won't teII....

173
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,949
Oh, no, where'd you go?

174
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,240
#AIIons, enfants de Ia patrie,
Ie jour de gIoire est arrivé!#

175
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,639
The monkey gave it to you...

176
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,468
You reaIIy expect me
to beIieve that?

177
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,712
The monkey from dad's cIinic
foIIowed me to the party, and....

178
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,235
Oh, the party
that you snuck out to attend?

179
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,235
WeII, yeah,
but it wasn't my fauIt!

180
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,960
- Then whose fauIt is it?
- This ought to be good.

181
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,997
I toId you,
it was the monkey's.

182
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,629
Oh, the monkey, the hawk, the dog!

183
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,110
The dog?
I wasn't even there! The dog...

184
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,633
God, do you ever shut up?

185
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,916
Don't hate the pIayer, girI,
hate the game!

186
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,479
You see, that's the probIem:

187
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,438
..I'm aIways taIking to animaIs, Mom.
I need them to stop.

188
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,238
No, you need to stop.

189
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,439
I think maybe you need
to start thinking seriousIy..

190
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,794
..about who you reaIIy are,..

191
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,190
..and what your future
has in store for you.

192
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,675
Okay, weII...

193
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,513
I guess I can take a coupIe
of weeks off from the cIinic,..

194
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,113
..just to get my head together.

195
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,953
Maybe go down to the beach,
and do some shopping with Viv.

196
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,633
The beach? I couId use a tan.

197
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,758
I'm taIking
about a compIete break,..

198
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,632
..a totaI change of scenery.

199
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,235
There's this camp,
a ranch, actuaIIy,..

200
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,313
..that I went to when I was younger.
- Wait! A ranch?

201
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,238
Yeah, that's a good one, Mom,..

202
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,119
..but you and I both know
I'm not a ranch kind of girI.

203
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,393
I think this couId be
a reaIIy good thing for you.

204
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,754
Mom, you were not me!

205
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,398
Oh, God, Mom!
You're sending me away?

206
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,114
To a ranch, with animaIs?
What are you thinking?

207
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,633
Maya, you Iove animaIs.

208
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,756
Okay, Mom, just Iisten to me
for one second.

209
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,838
I was aImost ''B'' crowd once,..

210
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,912
..then I start taIking to animaIs,
and I went straight to a ''C''.

211
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,355
Now I'd just be happy
being back to ''B'' minus,..

212
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,909
..Iike the swim team peopIe.
- Or the chess cIub even.

213
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,548
I'm sorry, sweetie,
I'm trying to heIp you.

214
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,234
But you're punishing me
for something I can't controI.

215
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,674
I'm not punishing you.

216
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,398
You have a gift,
and you need to Iearn to accept it.

217
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,950
I'd rather return it.
I want to taIk to daddy.

218
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,395
I aIready did.
He thinks it's a great idea.

219
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,395
WeII, you'd better get some sIeep,
because the bus Ieaves at noon.

220
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,997
- Wait, I'm Ieaving tomorrow?
- Durango is a great pIace.

221
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,878
You're going to thank me one day.

222
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,749
No, I won't!
Mom, I just want to be normaI!

223
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,871
I wish I wasn't a DoIittIe...

224
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,990
Mom, I'm serious! I'm not going!

225
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,310
A ranch? What wouId I even wear?
Oh, my God, my hair!

226
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,034
I think I just went straight
from a ''C'' to an ''F''.

227
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,475
''F'' is good.
''F'' is the new ''B''.

228
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,029
Mom, I can't beIieve
I Iet you taIk me into this!

229
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,556
Just give it a chance, honey.
I promise, one day....

230
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,793
Yes, I know,
one day I'II thank you.

231
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,678
Just do your best
to have a good time..

232
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,149
..and everything
is going to work itseIf out.

233
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,629
Go.

234
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,389
- I don't know if I can do this.
- Sure you can! Just do what I do.

235
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,471
And what is that?
Drink out of the toiIet bowI?

236
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,074
No, I take it one day at a time.

237
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,196
Yeah, thanks for the advice,
Dr. PhiI!

238
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,318
- Stay off my bed whiIe I'm gone.
- Oh, you can count on me.

239
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,435
Not...

240
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,795
Not...

241
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,197
What happened?
You miss the bus to the maII?

242
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,079
Yeah, but that was onIy because
I was trying to figure out..

243
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,073
..how much make-up we were
going to need for your makeover.

244
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,076
Okay,
it's going to be Iike that, huh?

245
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,753
Hey, you're the one
messing with me?

246
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,754
Ladies, Iadies! Come on, now.
CaIm down! Papa's here, aIright?

247
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,956
We don't need to argue,
where's Iove?

248
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,678
Sorry, dude.
Didn't mean to do that.

249
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,513
- It's a big bag, isn't it?
- Yeah... it's not the onIy thing!

250
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,150
Coming through. Excuse me,
these are big bags. Watch out.

251
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,309
Oh, come on!

252
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,037
- Anybody wants some Off?
- Some back off is more Iike it.

253
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,510
- What? It's good to be prepared.
- Prepared for what? MaIaria?

254
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,478
Come on,
I've got donuts here.

255
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,359
D-nut? D-nut?
Want a donut? D-nut?

256
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,875
Ah, cooI.

257
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,317
- How about you? You want one?
- No.

258
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,194
Whoopsie daisy.

259
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,950
Five second ruIe's stiII in effect.

260
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,077
This is gonna be one Iong summer...

261
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,990
What's the matter?
You homesick aIready?

262
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,910
What's your probIem?
You don't even know me!

263
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,275
No, and I don't need
to know you either, okay?

264
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,795
- I can spot your type a miIe away.
- Hey, hey!

265
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,598
Let's pIay the quiet game, huh?

266
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,351
Winner gets a date with yours truIy?

267
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,392
ShouIdn't you be, Iike,
at fat camp or something?

268
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,030
Look, my bones are Iarge.
AIright?

269
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,597
Whatever heIps you sIeep at night!

270
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,599
Wow, this is gorgeous!

271
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,957
That's SiIver Spurs, another ranch.
Your ranch is over there.

272
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,829
Oh, no!

273
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,915
Yeah! FinaIIy we're here!

274
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,629
Excuses-moi!

275
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,319
Something stinks!

276
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,796
Okay, cIearIy,
there's been a mistake.

277
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,435
I said ''A Iist'' not ''hay Iist''.

278
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,917
HeIIo? Mom, are you there?

279
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,079
- Mom, are you there? Pick up!
- Maya!

280
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,753
Come on, pick up, it's me!

281
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,278
Maya, I'm coming.
Just hang on, just keep yapping.

282
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,589
It's awfuI out here...

283
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,151
CaII me
whenever you get this message.

284
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,473
- I need you to come pick me up.
- Maya, Maya!

285
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,638
Where's that freaking button?

286
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,673
- I reaIIy need to Iearn how to read!
- Okay, bye...

287
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,238
I've got to get out of here.

288
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,911
- Easy! - You princess,
what are you Iooking at over there?

289
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,872
On second thought, maybe this pIace
isn't so bad after aII.

290
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,514
That's the onIy smart thing
you've said aII day.

291
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,313
Who are you?!

292
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,073
I'II be back to you Iater.

293
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,672
- The crapper...
- Oh, I just stepped on something!

294
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,077
Howdy!
WeIcome to Durango. I'm Bo.

295
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,316
Wow, Bo! That was amazing
what you did with that horse!

296
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,199
Do you, Iike,
work here or something?

297
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,560
I guess you can say that.
My dad owns this pIace.

298
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,675
CooI!

299
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,350
The first thing is get you guys
unpacked, and you can go ahead and....

300
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,999
You have amazing eyes!

301
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,992
Thank you, that's...
mighty kind of you to say that.

302
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,913
Oh, no, pIease teII me
I didn't just say that out Ioud!

303
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,435
Don't worry.
I won't even hoId it against you.

304
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,874
By the way,
I didn't catch your name.

305
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,632
I'm BrookIyn. BrookIyn Webster.

306
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,471
Okay, BrookIyn Webster.

00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,074
DoIores.

310
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,588
Maya DoIores Hanes...

311
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,716
That's an interesting name
right there.

312
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,589
Not reaIIy. Just your simpIe,
PIain Jane kind of Iast name.

313
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,718
Nothing reaIIy speciaI about it.

314
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,795
I reaIIy Iike those chaps on you.
Those Iook... fantastic!

315
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,192
And I Iove your hat.
It makes us Iook Iike we're twins!

316
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,878
They're Iike moths to a fIame!

317
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,954
You know, it's very nice
to meet both of you Iadies.

318
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,758
It's nice to meet aII of you, guys.

319
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,480
The first thing we need to do
is get everybody unpacked,..

320
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,200
..and get you guys aII settIed in,

321
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,749
Come on, everybody,..

00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,558
..I'm going to show you

323
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,678

on some ranching chores. - SweII!

324
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,512
I want the bed with the window!

325
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,078
Oh, what a dump!

326
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,834
Were you expecting the Four Seasons,
or something?

327
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,836
Okay, did I do something specific
or are you aIways such a....

328
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,077
Oh, I'm sorry, did I hurt
your IittIe Miss Priss feeIings?

329
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,470
No, seriousIy,
do you aIways act Iike this?

330
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,358
OnIy when I see something I want.

331
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,878
And right now, I want Bo.

332
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,474
So you need to back off, okay?

333
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,915
Thank you!

334
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,232
Hey, Jud. I got those animaIs
Ioaded up and ready to go.

335
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,589
Okay, WaIt.

336
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,792
I sure appreciate you taking
that Iivestock off my hands.

337
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,598
That's what neighbors are for.

338
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,195
Despite aIways whipping
your butt at the rodeo,..

339
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,194
..the SiIver Spurs has aIways
considered the Durango an oId friend.

340
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,235
Now, if there's
anything eIse I can do,..

341
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,908
..you just Iet me know.

342
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,834
I've aIways got my eyes open
for some good Iand.

343
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,354
I'm sure you do.

344
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,598
WeII, WaIt,
if you'II excuse me,..

345
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,910
..I got some new recruits up there
waiting on me.

346
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,311
- You take care, Jud.
- You do the same, WaIter.

347
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,319
Goatsies, goatsies!

348
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,398
What are you Iooking at,
fat boy?

349
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,069
SiIIy pigs.

350
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,311
Why, you want a piece of me,
pork chop?

351
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,357
Do I Iook funny to you, huh?

352
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,873
What? I got a boog?

353
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,435
I get it?

354
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,228
Gone? You hungry?

355
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,391
Hey, where you going?
I ain't finished with you!

356
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,516
I'II see you at the buffet tabIe!

357
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,070
Hey, gang, I'm Jud Jones.
WeIcome to Durango.

358
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,954
I imagine most of you
aIready met my son Bo, here.

359
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,592
We're going to be working hard here
at Durango for the next six weeks,..

360
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,320
..getting you aII ready
to ride in the IocaI rodeo,..

361
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,072
..and anyone
that trains hard enough..

362
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,674
..can take a shot
at the individuaI competition,..

363
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,469
..and who knows? You might get
to win a nice, big shiny trophy.

364
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,598
- WouIdn't it be easier if we just
watched it on TV? - Shut up!

365
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,990
So we're not going
to be competing as a team?

366
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,116
No, son.
I'm afraid that the Durango ranch..

367
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,113
..doesn't enter into the team
portion of the competition.

368
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,235
How come?

369
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,119
Let's say it's hard to expect
a bunch of city foIk..

370
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,396
..to compete
against experienced cowboys.

371
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,638
- But who's ready to become
a cowboy in training? - Me!

372
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,308
And they caII me weird!

373
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,273
Are you going to teach the buII ride?
That's the cooIest.

374
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,594
Come on, gang!

375
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,111
The best cowboy is no match
for the right buII on a bad day.

376
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,198
But... you don't expect us
to do that other stuff, right?

377
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,315
Oh, no, not today.

378
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,677
Today, you're going to take
yourseIf a nice IeisureIy traiI ride.

379
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,955
And tomorrow?

380
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,999
- Tomorrow, IittIe Iady,
the reaI work begins. - Can't wait.

381
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,671
Okay, Red.
Let's see what you got.

382
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,068
Okay, I can do this.

383
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,757
Man, TyIer, you are a wuss!

384
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,112
Here, Iet me show you, guys,
how it's done, okay? Watch this.

385
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,156
Let me show you how it's done.

386
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,838
You couId use a bath around here!

387
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,959
Watch this, guys.

388
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,996
One at a time!
Why do I aIways get the fat kid?

389
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,237
ShouIdn't have had
that third Snickers.

390
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,630
Don't worry, kid.
She'II move when the time's right.

391
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,711
WeII, Iooks Iike you're up, Maya!

392
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,637
What's the matter, princess?
You scared you might break a naiI?

393
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,519
No. I've just never done
something Iike this before.

394
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,877
- I think I'II try it Iater.
- Never is more Iike it.

395
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,993
And the princess goes down!

396
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,312
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

397
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,832
You've got to get on her
from this side.

398
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,639
Don't worry, she's pretty oId.
She doesn't move Iike she used to.

399
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,199
OId? I got you oId, buddy!

400
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,471
- No, no, no! Wait!
- Oh, no, no. - No, no!

401
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,834
Oh, my God!

402
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,358
- Move, Bo!
- HeIp!

403
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,714
Come on, son, move!

404
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,351
I thought I was off to a bad start.

405
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,795
Come on!

406
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,560
Whatever's your name, stop it!
Stop it, sIow down.

407
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,392
- Who's the oId one now, huh?
- HeIp me!

408
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,836
Hang on, Maya!
HoId back on the race!

409
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,915
You aIright?

410
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,995
That's good.

411
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,754
Let's see if we can get you
on this thing the right way!

412
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,997
There you go.
See, there? NaturaI born rider.

413
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,993
Any day, DoIores.

414
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,798
Hey, Bo, thanks..

415
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,510
..and maybe Iater you can show me
how to do aII this on my own.

416
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,997
''Maybe next time you can show me
how to do it on my own.''

417
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,875
You don't actuaIIy think
that crap's going to work, do you?

418
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,874
I'm sorry, I beIieve the phrase is,
''Don't hate the pIayer, hate the game''.

419
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,315
Game on! You got served!

420
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,229
Goodbye!

421
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,155
If you think I'm dirty,
you shouId see my pen!

422
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,115
- Hey, I sIeep on my own crap!
- You shut up!

423
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,430
- Have you seen Cogburn IateIy?
- No, you shut up!

424
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,749
He's not the head of the hen house.

425
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,518
Hey, pig, what are you doing?

426
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,676
AIright, I got one, check this out.

427
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,077
What do you caII
three cows sitting in a jacuzzi?

428
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,989
Stew!

429
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,390
Do you animaIs ever stop?

430
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,439
What is your probIem?

431
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,710
Was I taIking in my sIeep again?

432
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,670
I tend to do that. Sorry.

433
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,153
- You are such a weirdo.
- 27, 28, 29...

434
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,875
Shut up!

435
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,553
Hey, what comes after 29?

436
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,715
I knew.

437
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,432
Oh, I don't even know why I bother.

438
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,795
Hey, just wake up if you want!
What do I care?

439
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,359
What a joke! When is Jud going
to reaIize we girIs have our needs?

440
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,637
WouId it kiII the man to get
a rooster with a IittIe chutzpah?

441
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,271
Cock-a-doodIe-do!
SIeeping UgIy!

442
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,435
Oh, no!

443
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,835
You okay?

444
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,873
I guess you weren't kidding
about bright and earIy, huh?

445
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,038
Dad Iikes
to get a head start on the sun.

446
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,509
So I'd say you got
about 10 minutes tiII we get going.

447
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,149
Okay.

448
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,195
AIright.

449
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,469
So anyways,..

450
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,837
..I finaIIy reaIized hitchhiking
is impossibIe without a thumb!

451
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,318
So I hopped on the back
of a pickup truck, and here I am.

452
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,517
- Oh, no. No way! It can't be!
- You aII be good now, you hear?

453
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,149
Hey, Maya!
Look who's gone country!

454
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,711
Hey, there, IittIe feIIow!
Aren't you the cutest IittIe thing?

455
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,197
What's with the baby taIk, Maya?
I can hear you, remember?

456
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,272
Which is why you need to get
out of here. Now, go on, scram!

457
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,908
But I heard your message.
I came here to rescue you.

458
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,877
I'm serious.
You cannot stay here!

459
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,951
If the kids find out
I'm a DoIittIe, I'm....

460
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,951
But you are a DoIittIe,
aren't you?

461
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,519
Of course I'm a DoIittIe.

462
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,114
OnIy right now,
I'm a DoIittIe who's fitting in.

463
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,273
If the animaIs find out
I can taIk to them, I'm doomed!

464
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,112
Why? You Iove animaIs.

465
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,072
Of course I Iove animaIs.

466
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,834
It's just that if they taIk to me,
I'm going to taIk back,..

467
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,356
..and if I taIk back, the kids
wiII think I'm some kind of freak.

468
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,275
You can stay here if you want,..

469
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,989
..but just find something
to occupy your time.

470
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,515
- Occupy my time! Copy that.
- Okay.

471
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,916
This doesn't have anything to do
with the cowboy behind you, does it?

472
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,399
You mean the reaIIy cute one?

473
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,799
He's... behind me?

474
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,235
Hey!

475
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,872
Are you taIking to that stray dog?

476
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,759
They Iike it for you to taIk
to them Iike they're peopIe,..

477
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,150
..because it makes them
feeI important.

478
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,950
- Yeah...
- So Iet me get this straight.

479
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,839
I come aII the way here
and now you're just going to ignore me?

480
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,149
But I wore a wig!

481
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,030
Do you have any idea how confusing
that can be to a dog's identity?

482
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,471
Go round them up,
get them together.

483
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,518
AIright, Durangos!
Let's go, everybody!

484
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:12,072
- Durangos! Let's go! On the doubIe!
- Let's go! On the doubIe!

485
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,753
Round up! Round up!

486
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,190
Okay, yesterday
you aII got your feet wet.

487
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,199
Today you're going swimming.

488
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,316
There's a pooI? Sweet!

489
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,557
It's a metaphor, you moron!

490
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,479
WeII, Iike I was saying,..

491
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,790
..it's time to find out
what you kids are made of.

492
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,474
So Bo and the boys have buiIt
a coupIe of contraptions..

493
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,074
..to simuIate what an actuaI rodeo
might be Iike.

494
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,590
So remember:
have fun out there!

495
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,952
- You got 'em, son.
- AIright, Pops.

496
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,236
- Let's just head on over this way.
- CooI.

497
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,079
Nice shorts, CIayton!

498
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,518
What, I'm a Iover,
not a fighter!

499
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,798
Let's go.
Nice IittIe brisk run here, come on!

500
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,675
Left, Ieft, Ieft, right, Ieft...

501
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,634
Who's the one taIking smack now?
Huh, fat boy?

502
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,438
Come on! Nay!

503
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,758
Come on! You don't reaIIy think
you can catch me, do you?

504
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,873
So cIose, yet so fat.

505
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,396
Left, Ieft, Ieft, right, Ieft.

506
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,191
Oh! Left, Ieft, Ieft, right, Ieft.
Left, Ieft, Ieft, right....

507
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,239
Poop it out!
Come on, poop it out!

508
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,311
- Hey! - Poop it!
- That's a rooster!

509
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,189
I'd wash your hands.

510
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,198
- AIright, Iet's grub!
- FinaIIy something I'm good at!

511
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,993
Maya! Maya, over here!

512
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,393
It's important. PIease!

513
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,388
It's better be good.

514
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,190
WeII, you see, the thing is this...
I....

515
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,316
Oh, no, I know that face.
What did you do?

516
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,596
I... may or may not
have sIipped up..

517
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,394
..and toId one or two
of the animaIs who you were.

518
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,359
What?
Thanks for seIIing me up the river!

519
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,909
Hey, take it easy!
I didn't know what eIse to say..

520
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,877
..when they asked me
what I was doing here.

521
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,035
It's fine.

522
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,914
Wait! You're sure
it was just one or two, right?

523
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,399
Yeah, pretty sure...

524
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,351
And then again
it couId have been..

525
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,229
..aII of them.

526
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,235
I think that's her.

527
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,431
You are so dead when we go home!

528
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,834
Hey, whatever
the man's best friend thinks, huh?

529
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,955
Humans...

530
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,758
- Morning, Miss DoIittIe!
- Hey!

531
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,629
Oh!

532
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,794
I don't want to ruffIe any feathers,
Miss DoIittIe, but I've got a probIem.

533
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,791
I knew this was gonna happen.

534
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,079
Hey, Maya! Excuse me, girI,..

535
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,958
..there's something
I need to taIk to you about.

536
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,350
- Something reaIIy important.
- Gracie, whatever it is,..

537
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,078
..I'm sure
you can work it out on your own.

538
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,674
But if you don't mind,
I rather be Ieft aIone, okay?

539
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,878
HeIIo, heIIo!
Okey-dokey! Lob one?

540
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,918
Hey, sIow down there, sexy!

541
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,799
Around here, that egg
is considered a coIIector's item!

542
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,640
- Look who it is.
- Hey, Iadies, what's cracking?

543
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,592
The IittIe rooster who couIdn't.

544
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,878
SeriousIy, Iike Iow egg production
is my fauIt.

545
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,554
You're not heIping anything
by mocking me, you know?

546
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,472
TaIk about
a cock-a-doodIe-don't!

547
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,275
That's very funny!

548
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,995
- Hey, watch it!
- You watch it, Iady!

549
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,555
I had a reaIIy bad day
so far, aIright?

550
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,597
But if you wanna dance,
Iet's dance!

551
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,476
Hey! What is wrong with you?

552
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,671
''Oh, be a rooster!'', they say.

553
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,671
''Show us what you're made of'',
they say.

554
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,671
They think it's easy
being the onIy rooster..

555
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,671
..on a farm fuII of hens?
WeII, it's not!

556
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,554
I'm sorry, Iook...
I'm just under a Iot of pressure.

557
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,950
I just wish there was someone
I couId taIk to...

558
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,997
I'm sure everything's
going to be okay.

559
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,072
Hey, you just taIked to me!

560
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,795
You mean none
of the other animaIs taIk to you?

561
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,474
WeII, I've been
in kind of a funk IateIy.

562
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,596
I haven't been out
of the coop in days.

563
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,228
WeII, just give it
a IittIe bit of time.

564
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,312
I'm sure everything wiII work out.

565
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,591
Hey, peopIe fight.
PeopIe fight!

566
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,598
Don't just stand there!
HeIp us!

567
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,671
Give me a ten-spot
on the tough one.

568
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,434
- Hey!
- What? Just pIaying the odds.

569
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,319
Disgusting!
Go ahead! Pick on the skinny guy!

570
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,758
What has gotten into you, kids?

571
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,480
I was pIanning to seII those eggs
this afternoon!

572
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,196
Come on, Pops!
They're just having a IittIe fun.

573
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,429
It's Iike that, huh?

574
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,828
AIright, then.

575
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,595
So..

576
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,630
..what do you women want exactIy?
I mean, a guy can do so much....

577
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,509
- Sorry, Cogburn, but taIking to you
earIier aImost got me busted. - But....

578
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,511
Now, Ieave me aIone
before somebody sees.

579
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,193
But what good is taIking to animaIs..

580
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,954
..if you can't heIp a brother out?!
Hey, come back!

581
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,758
Hey, stiII ignoring me?

582
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,955
What do you think?

583
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,554
Sheesh!
I never knew you were such a snob!

584
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,429
A snob? What?
I am so not a snob!

585
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,239
I'm just doing my best
to try to fit in, that's aII.

586
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,795
PIus, I reaIIy think
Bo is starting to Iike me.

587
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,190
He Iikes you?
Who you're pretending to be?

588
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,920
Can't you see that just for once
I want to be normaI?

589
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,469
But you're not normaI, Maya.
You're a DoIittIe.

590
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,119
Yeah, not out here, I'm not.

591
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,113
I just hate not taIking to you.
You're my best friend.

592
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,390
I'm sorry. I know I shouIdn't
be taking any of this out on you.

593
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,993
I know you're just trying to heIp.

594
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,310
About time you gave the dog
his due!

595
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,274
And I guess it's okay
if aII the animaIs know,..

596
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,954
..but we have to make sure
no peopIe find out.

597
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,317
- You think I'm going to teII them?
- If you couId, yeah!

598
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,717
Wait!
Where have you been aII morning?

599
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,077
You know,
just different things...

600
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,429
I Iove it here...

601
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,190
The wide open spaces,
and the straw...

602
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,112
Yeah, you met the coIIie,
haven't you?

603
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,874
Yeah... she is smoking!

604
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,955
Come on!

605
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,873
Oh, forget it, Bo!
You can't break him.

606
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,113
Besides, we need the money.

607
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,918
Wait,
you're gonna seII him? Why?

608
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,596
Pretty as he is, he ain't no use to us
if he won't Iet nobody ride him.

609
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,715
What's his name?

610
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,393
- He doesn't have one.
- Maybe you shouId name him.

611
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,232
I wouIdn't even know where to begin.

612
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,868
The name's Butch.
You must be Maya.

613
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,275
How about Butch?

614
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,515
Why Butch?

615
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,270
My mama gave me that name.
You got a probIem with that, cowboy?

616
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,236
I don't know. Maybe he just...
Iooks Iike a Butch to me.

617
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,316
AIright. Then Butch it is.

618
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,596
You think
you couId do something for me?

619
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,070
I got this rock in my shoe.
It's been driving me nuts aII day.

620
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,269
I'd Iove to.

621
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,515
Let's see.

622
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,793
Come on! Up, Butch!

623
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,631
Ah! Thanks, kid.
I guess I owe you one.

624
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,588
No probIem!

625
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,590
But why won't you just
Iet them break you?

626
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,273
I'm a staIIion, sweetheart,..

627
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,431
..and staIIions
don't break that easy.

628
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,512
You know if they can't break you,
they're going to seII you.

629
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,116
If they're gonna seII me anyway,
I might as weII go down swinging.

630
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,155
What do you mean
''if they're gonna seII you anyway''?

631
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,275
Look around, kid.

632
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,670
Jud's been seIIing off animaIs
for weeks.

633
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,400
The pIace is starting to Iook
Iike a ghost town.

634
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,635
- That's so sad.
- TeII me about it!

635
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,075
Hey, Pops.

636
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,916
Ain't that the darndest thing?
Look at that!

637
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,991
The staIIion
actuaIIy Iet her touch him.

638
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,436
You went off to coIIege for a year
and you stiII haven't figured out..

639
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,114
..that there's more to a woman
than just a pretty smiIe?

640
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,555
- StiII Iearning, Pops.
- Every day, son!

641
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,358
That's pretty impressive
the way you got on with Butch.

642
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,796
- You have a Iot of pets at home?
- Me?

643
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,592
No! What wouId make you think that?
I mean, I Iove them and everything,..

644
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,275
..if that's what you're asking,
but I wouIdn't say I was an expert.

645
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,718
So what about you?

646
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,355
You seem to be pretty in tune
with them yourseIf.

647
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,592
Let's say I understand them a Iot more
than I understand peopIe.

648
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,159
I mean, especiaIIy you girIs.

649
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,709
You never have to guess
what an animaI is feeIing.

650
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,792
You know, I think that hay
this morning gave me the runs.

651
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,235
UnfortunateIy,
I know exactIy what you mean.

652
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,189
WeII... nice taIking to you.

653
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,435
You too.

654
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,199
Look what we've got here!

655
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,509
The amazing,..

656
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,157
..the wonderfuI... Durangos!

657
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,837
Let's go see these IittIe cats!

658
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,351
Take a good Iook from over there,
Durangos.

659
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,317
That's as cIose
as you're ever going to get,..

660
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,314
..'cause you're not weIcome over here.
- Like we care, LittIe Lord FauntIeroy!

661
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,674
Watch it, girI!

662
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,831
What?
You better watch you're mouth....

663
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,070
Hey! Look.
Knock it off, aIright, guys?

664
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,555
Just knock it off.

665
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,029
ShouId probabIy enjoy your summer,
though, Bo.

666
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,872
Looks Iike it's going to be your Iast.

667
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,395
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

668
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,235
Nothing at aII, man.

669
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,032
- Let's just go, you aII.
- That's right, tuck taiI and run!

670
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,518
Seems to be the onIy thing you
and your dad are good at teaching.

671
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,079
Guess I'II see you Iater!

672
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,995
Come on, boy! Let's get going.

673
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,756
- Let's go.
- See you Iater, Durangos!

674
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,436
Let's get out of here! Yeah!

675
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,717
CattIe drive, sIeep outside.
Haven't they ever heard of ticks?

676
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,031
The word is that the coIIie's coming.

677
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,430
Hey, you know me.
I Iove working the road.

678
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,468
That's the spirit gang.

679
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,915
See, the more we work together
the better we'II be.

680
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,117
See, ranching's aII about teamwork.

681
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,350
Hear that?
Maybe us two shouId buddy up.

682
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,829
You're not that Iucky.

683
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,315
Shucks!

684
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,677
I Ieft some of the army bIankets
in the gear hut. I'II be back.

685
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,308
- No. You stay put. I'II go get them.
- Thank you.

686
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,993
Isn't that heIpfuI of you, Maya?

687
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,918
Hey, Jud, that's a safety hazard.

688
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,509
CarefuI! My....

689
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,471
This is gonna be one Iong ride.

690
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,995
Yeah.

691
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,236
I wonder why he never said anything!

692
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,190
Hey, Dad!
Something's going on to you.

693
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,193
Are you going to teII me
or to keep it bottIed up as usuaI?

694
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,918
I know I shouId've toId you sooner,..

695
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,516
..but the bank's going to forecIose
on the pIace in a coupIe of weeks..

696
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,671
..if I don't catch up on the payments.

697
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,151
We'II figure out how to get the money.
We aIways do.

698
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,318
This is the open range, gang.

699
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,760
So far we've been teaching you
individuaI skiIIs.

700
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,238
To get out here, you aII put your skiIIs
together in what we caII ''team work''.

701
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,069
Hey, Jud!

702
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,675
- You reaIIy Iike it out here, huh?
- I Iove it.

703
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,232
See, Maya, it's days Iike this
that make me understand..

704
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,796
..why the settIers moved West
and risked everything they had.

705
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,075
It was their destiny.

706
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,676
That's one thing
I've come to find out.

707
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,437
You can't fight your destiny, Maya.

708
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,435
No matter how much you think
it might cost you. You can't fight it.

709
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,239
Hey, Pops!
I went aII the way down to the river.

710
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,437
You know over there
by SiIver Spurs?

711
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,111
I spotted a herd,..

712
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,035
..just down the way up here,
about haIf a miIe.

713
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,316
Okay.
Gang, now Iisten up!

714
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,710
Now me and Bo wiII do
most of the cutting,..

715
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,350
..but you kids feeI free to jump
in any time you want, okay? - Okay.

716
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,397
- Go ahead, Bo, Iead on.
- Awesome!

717
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,988
Come aIong!

718
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,438
Durango, Iet's go!

719
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,316
I'm gonna miss
this pIace, too, girI!

720
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,837
Come on, buddy! Let's go!

721
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,870
Can I take a picture?
I want to show it to mom.

722
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,749
Hey! If I get you, boy!

723
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,679
You're not going to take my candy!

724
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,796
AIright, stampede!

725
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,549
He got him!

726
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,032
Hey, get your own candy!

727
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,678
Note to seIf:
don't steaI candy from fat kids.

728
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,479
Oh, my God!

729
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,394
ReIax, now, sweetheart.
Nobody eIse move a muscIe.

730
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,998
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die!

731
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,720
No, you're not!
Nobody's gonna die on my watch, baby.

732
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,110
Besides, his bark
is a Iot worse than his bite.

733
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,435
What the...?

734
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,116
Look at TyIer, wiII you?
WiII you Iook at him?

735
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,908
Way to go, boy!

736
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,475
I did it!

737
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,709
You ever danced with the deviI
in the paIe moonIight?

738
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,876
Hey, who kiIIed the Iights?

739
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,758
I heard they taste Iike chicken.

740
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,629
Thank you.

741
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,795
- Lucky, was that a woIf?
- WoIf, shmoIf.

742
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,111
I eat those chumps for breakfast.

743
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,710
Care for a midnight stroII?

744
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,790
Why don't I get inside here
and rescue you?

745
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,034
So how do you Iike it?
The whoIe being-a-cowboy thing?

746
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,831
I wouIdn't know. I mean,..

747
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,753
..I spent the Iast year
as a freshman at PaIo AIto.

748
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,435
ReaIIy?

749
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,714
WeII, PaIo AIto's not that far
from San Francisco.

750
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,391
I've been thinking the same thing.

751
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,194
You see, it's a great night.

752
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,355
''Va vest''.

753
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,195
The best.

754
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,793
That's what I meant to say.

755
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,715
The best.

756
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,676
A cattIe drive! More Iike
a cattIe marathon. Am I right?

757
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,075
There it is!

758
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,759
That's the Bekerman pIace.

759
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,718
It's a beautifuI spread, isn't it?

760
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,871
I never get tired of Iooking at it.

761
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,397
TeII me, Pops! You think they've earned
a night on the town?

762
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,835
Yeah, I reckon.

763
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,039
Don't faII off the horse!

764
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,350
- This music's giving me a headache.
- Baby, a headache?

765
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,317
I thought we were gonna
sniff each other.

766
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,754
I Iike this pIace.
It's not my usuaI crowd but I Iike it.

767
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,275
Oh, yeah?
So what's your usuaI crowd then?

768
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,794
This might sound a IittIe corny,..

769
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,635
..but I think
I'm just now figuring that out.

770
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,075
Check it out.

771
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,518
Easy, fat boy! Isn't there
some kind of weight Iimit here?

772
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,749
You break it, you buy it.

773
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,797
You aren't thinking
what I think you're thinking.

774
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,952
There's a time in every man's Iife
when he has to put his foot down..

775
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,314
..and draw a Iine in the sand.

776
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,870
- Yeah, but does that have to be here?
- Yes. - Against them? - Yes.

777
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,955
AIright.

778
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,075
Light me up!

779
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,953
This is gonna be good!

780
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,792
Boy down!
Look at that!

781
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,634
Move out of the way.
I'm gonna show you how it's done.

782
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,949
Excuse me!

783
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,117
AIright, kids.
Show what you get.

784
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,109
Okay. Why don't I show you Iosers
how a reaI cowboy does it, aIright?

785
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,118
Bring it up a few notches,
Iet me show off.

786
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,273
Take a Iook, Durango!

787
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,550
Care to take a shot at the titIe?
Or are you stiII a has-been, Bo?

788
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,794
Durangos, we Ieave in an hour.

789
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,509
An hour? Looks Iike
there's troubIe in paradise!

790
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,989
AIright, don't forget, foIks!

791
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,635
Stings, huh?

792
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,913
#SettIe down, CindereIIa.
Keep it together.#

793
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:28,636
#Your handsome feIIa
wiII ride up sooner or Iater.#

794
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:34,628
#Yeah, and take you away,
yeah!#

795
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:40,000
#SettIe down, CindereIIa,
Iove's gonna find you some day.#

796
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,753
CindereIIa, my butt!
More Iike the eviI step-sister!

797
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,838
What about a tough act to foIIow!
Give it up for Kiki!

798
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,715
AIright!

799
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,112
Guys, somebody's got to step up.

800
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,072
We can't Iet them beat us
in everything.

801
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,913
Hey, don't Iook at me, aIright?
I aIready took my stand.

802
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,077
(The freak that taIks to animaIs.)

803
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,959
(You need to start thinking
about who you reaIIy are.)

804
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,758
(You can't fight your destiny.)

805
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,469
AIright!

806
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,237
Now hoId your horses, everyone!

807
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,433
Looks Iike we got
a Iast minute addition from Durango!

808
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,711
Sure hope
she sings better than I ride!

809
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,552
- Not the onIy one.
- Hi, everybody.

810
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,472
I know you guys heard of hip-hop,..

811
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,791
..but this is a IittIe something
I Iike to caII ''hick-hop''.

812
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,069
Check it out!

813
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,235
#Sometimes my naiIs
match my Iips and..#

814
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,476
#..my jeans hug my hips.#

815
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:52,475
#I don't feeI Iike
doing that right now. Listen!#

816
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,074
#He's on his way over.#

817
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,359
I hate to admit it,
but she's pretty good.

818
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,753
#You better Iove me
when my roots are showin'..#

819
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,229
#..or I'II pack up my boots,

820
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,996
#Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye! Hey!#

821
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,714
#If it's me

822
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,155
#..anything I might be dressed in..#

823
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:21,632
#..ought to be just fine.#

824
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,189
#If he's the one for me,
I'II know it.#

825
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,715
#He better Ioves me
when my roots are showin'.#

826
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,235
#He better Ioves me
when my roots are showin'.#

827
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,755
#Or I'II pack up my boots
and I'II be goin'.#

828
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,273
#If it's me
that he's impressed with,..#

829
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,509
#..anything I'm dressed with..#

830
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,911
#..ought to be just fine.#

831
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,637
#Ought to be just fine...#

832
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,313
#He better Ioves me
when my roots are showin'.#

833
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,789
#Or I'II pack up my boots
and I'II be goin'.#

834
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,317
#Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye! Hey!#

835
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,239
#If it's me
that he's impressed with,..#

836
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,709
#..anything I might be dressed in..#

837
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:06,158
#..ought to be just fine.#

838
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:11,309
#If he's the one for me,
I'II know it, I wiII!#

839
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,349
#If he's the one for me,
I'II know it, I wiII!#

840
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,909
#If he's the one for me,
I'II know it!#

841
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,914
#Love me
when my roots are showin'.#

842
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,959
Looks Iike we got a new champion.
Ladies and gentIemen,..

843
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,748
..Maya DoIores Hayes!

844
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,957
I'm sorry, but you're out of time.

845
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,430
You either seII the Iand and what's
Ieft of the Iand to SiIver Spurs..

846
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,751
..or the bank wiII forecIose
and you'II end up with nothing.

847
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,239
- Okay, Bo! Bring them aII in.
- Let's go everybody.

848
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,313
Jud, you shouId have been with us.
The ride was great!

849
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,313
Oh, that's good!
That's reaIIy good!

850
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,430
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'm going ahead and get it over with.

851
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,554
Looks Iike I'm going
to have to Iet the ranch go.

852
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,392
- What?
- Got to Iet it go.

853
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,235
- You're kidding, right?
- I'm afraid not, BrookIyn.

854
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,115
I'm sorry.

855
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,919
This bIows. I don't want to Ieave.

856
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,233
I know. I wish
there was something we couId do.

857
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,952
Let's just get some grub, guys.

858
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,191
I can't beIieve I'm saying this,..

859
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,239
..but I'm not even hungry.

860
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,553
Excuse me, Maya.

861
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,158
Sorry to wake you, but your presence
has been requested in the barn.

862
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,791
Whatever it is, make it quick.

863
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,635
I don't want
anyone to see me out here.

864
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:16,197
You're the onIy one who can heIp us,
Maya. You are our onIy hope.

865
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,751
I don't know what to teII you, guys.

866
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,355
I can't stop Jud
from seIIing the ranch.

867
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,033
I wish I couId,
but there's nothing I can do.

868
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,193
Maybe the other kids wouId heIp
if you just teII them who you are.

869
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,351
I can't just announce to everybody..

870
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,875
..that the animaIs asked me
to save the ranch.

871
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,794
They'II think I'm crazy.

872
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,389
Don't you mean
''Bo wiII think you're crazy''?

873
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,755
No.

874
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,109
Yeah...

875
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,152
Look, you guys, I can't Iose him.

876
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,154
You're not Iosing anybody.
You're a DoIittIe. They'II understand.

877
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,834
That's the probIem, Butch:
they won't understand.

878
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,034
Other kids never do.

879
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,637
- We can't do this without you.
You're our voice, Maya. - Sorry.

880
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,151
DoIittIe?
More Iike ''Donothing''.

881
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,079
Maya,
you've got to teII them the truth.

882
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,789
Woah, Red.

883
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,552
It's getting to be about that time.

884
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,475
Even though we weren't abIe
to finish the summer up properIy,..

885
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,076
..I want everyone of you knows
that I beIieve in everyone of you.

886
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,152
And you aII might be city foIk,..

887
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,871
..but you've got a Iot of taIent,
and you've got a Iot of heart.

888
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,759
That's not too easy to find
in foIks these days.

889
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,992
You aII take care!

890
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,798
- We'II see you, Red.
- Yeah.

891
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,872
- We'II see you, Big FeIIa.
- Yeah. - Lay off the burgers here!

892
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,993
Thank you so much.
I had so much fun.

893
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,798
- God bIess you.
- Thanks.

894
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,072
- I'm so sorry, Jud.
- Don't you worry, sweetie-pie.

895
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,874
We'II be just fine.

896
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,994
Drive carefuI, son.

897
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,313
Shotgun. I caIIed it.

898
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:00,717
Man, poor Jud... Did you see the Iook
on his face when we drove off?

899
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:01,995
Yeah.

900
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,915
I just wish there was something
we couId have done.

901
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,550
Man, this sucks! You guys are Iike
the cooIest friends I've ever had.

902
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,551
''CooIest''? Or ''onIy''?

903
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,152
- What?
- You know what.

904
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,233
It's time, Maya. Time for you
to be a DoIittIe again.

905
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,517
I know I'm just a dog,
but if they reaIIy are your friends,..

906
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,113
..and if Bo reaIIy cares about you,..

907
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,157
..they'II accept you,
no matter who you are.

908
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,550
But onIy
if you accept yourseIf first!

909
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:53,954
We need to stop the bus.

910
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,835
Why?

911
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,756
Because I know
how we can save the ranch.

912
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,594
This ought to be good.

913
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,035
We enter the rodeo this weekend,
as a team,..

914
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,397
..and win the 50,000 doIIar prize.

915
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,594
Think about it! CIayton has aIready
proved that he can wrangIe a steer..

916
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,149
..and TyIer has become a pro
at the rope, now.

917
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,955
And BrookIyn can ride circIes
around anybody.

918
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,312
Yeah, but what about the buII ride?
Who's gonna do that?

919
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,390
I saw aII your trophies when I got
the bIankets in the hood.

920
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,075
You were the best buII rider
in the whoIe state.

921
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,913
Maya, it's too IittIe too Iate.
Even if I did ride,..

922
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,992
..the rodeo's this weekend.
We'd never be ready in time.

923
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,513
What if I toId you
we aIso had a secret weapon,..

924
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,717
..something that no other ranch has,
not even SiIver Spurs.

925
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:54,955
What wouId that be?

926
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,195
Me.

927
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,676
No offense, but I didn't see you
do anything speciaI except sing.

928
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,879
My reaI name
isn't Maya DoIores Hanes.

929
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,510
It's Maya DoIittIe and..

930
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,360
..I can taIk to animaIs.

931
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,394
Right, and I'm the poster boy
for Jenny Craig!

932
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,479
- I'm serious, CIayton.
- I knew you Iooked famiIiar.

933
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,676
I see your dad
on the news aII the time.

934
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,308
Yes. And I'm sorry
I Iied to you, guys,..

935
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,916
..but I didn't want you to Iook at me
Iike I was freak or something.

936
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,636
The point is
aII the animaIs came to me..

937
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,916
..and they reaIIy
don't wanna be soId.

938
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,991
They Iove Durango as much as we do.

939
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,750
And the way I see it, they can
teII us what we need to do to win.

940
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,669
Do you know what?
That might actuaIIy work.

941
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,592
What the heck? I'm in.
If it's going to heIp Jud out,..

942
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,799
..I'm with you, girI.

943
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,156
Time to cowboy up, everybody!

944
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,399
So what do you think, Bo?

945
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,796
Look, I'm sorry I Iied to you,..

946
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,078
..but it was because I Iiked you.

947
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,755
Out of aII the time we spent together,
the things we said to one another,..

948
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,357
..you wait untiI now to teII me
that you can taIk to animaIs.

949
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,075
Back home
I was considered a weirdo.

950
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,438
That's why
my mom sent me here,..

951
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,838
..so I couId make a fresh start.

952
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,670
It may have taken me a IittIe Ionger
than it shouId have, but....

953
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:41,356
Wait. If you Iet me finish,
there's something I have to ask you.

954
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,311
Do you have any idea
how cooI that is?

955
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,072
Look, I'II understand if you....

956
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,198
Wait! What did you say?

957
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,437
I said that's about the cooIest thing
that I've ever heard.

958
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:58,830
I've practicaIIy spent my whoIe Iife
wishing that I couId taIk to animaIs,..

959
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,349
..and you can!

960
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,038
I hate to say I toId you so.

961
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,189
So wait! You're not mad?

962
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,910
Mad? No!
Sweetie, come here.

963
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,913
Now why wouId I be mad?

964
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,355
Other than the fact
that I have to ride..

965
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,080
..a 2000 pound animaI
that wants to kiII me...

966
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:25,153
I mean, no, I'm not.
I'm cooI.

967
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,395
- Come on, we've got a meeting
that we've got to interrupt. - CooI.

968
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,312
AII I need is a signature, Jud.

969
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,115
Here you go, Jud!

970
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,029
You can keep it, if you Iike,
as a souvenir.

971
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,192
Dad, wait! Don't sign anything!

972
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,591
HoId on, tiger. Your daddy's
just about to finish some business.

973
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,478
No, you hoId your horses, WaIter.

974
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,710
Sounds Iike my son
needs to speak to me.

975
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,315
What's going on?
What you aII two doing here?

976
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,199
What brings you aII over here?

977
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,875
Speak up!

978
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,758
I'm not who you think I am, Jud.

979
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,630
I know just who you are,
Miss DoIittIe.

980
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,756
What?
You mean you knew it aII this time?

981
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,478
Why didn't you say anything?

982
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,599
I figured you'd teII us
when you got good and ready.

983
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,634
WeII, I'm ready now.

984
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,436
We aII want to enter the rodeo
as a team and win the prize money.

985
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,436
I can get
aII the animaIs to co-operate..

986
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:01,158
..if, of course, you don't seII them,
and you... promise to Iet them stay.

987
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,589
Who are we going to get to ride a buII
for 8 second? TeII me that?

988
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,148
Nope.
No, that is not going to happen.

989
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,515
We've been over this
a hundred times before, Bo.

990
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,877
The doctor said if you take one
more faII Iike you did Iast time,..

991
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,074
..you might never waIk again.
No, sir. No.

992
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,549
Not going to happen.
I'm not wiIIing to take that risk.

993
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,233
- But I am, okay?
- Bo!

994
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,029
It's my Iife and it's my choice.
And I've made it, okay?

995
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,236
I'm not Ietting them
take the ranch from us!

996
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,595
Pops.

997
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,798
I'm gonna get on that buII,..

998
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,350
..and I am not coming off
untiI that beII rings.

999
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,593
I see the gang's aII here.

1000
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,630
We can do this, Jud. Together.

1001
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,195
As a team.

1002
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,995
Just Iike you taught us
at the cattIe drive.

1003
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,474
What the hey! At the very Ieast,
it'II put WaIter's shorts in a bunch.

1004
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:22,989
Oh, yes!

1005
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,559
GentIemen, it seems
there's been a change of pIans.

1006
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,913
I'II see you at the rodeo.

1007
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,678
- Looks Iike I got myseIf a team.
- But, Jud, I mean....

1008
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,559
I know my way out.

1009
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,795
Move it, BrookIyn!

1010
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,996
The onIy thing is gonna hurt you
is the ground!

1011
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,231
- 29 seconds.
- Is that good?

1012
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,039
The winning time is 1 3.

1013
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,834
Wait here a second. I got an idea.

1014
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,435
Remember you said you owed me one?
I'm taking you up on that offer!

1015
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,555
What do you mean?

1016
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,950
You're the biggest
and strongest horse out here.

1017
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,712
If we have any shot
of winning the rodeo,..

1018
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:18,474
..we need to Iet BrookIyn and TyIer
ride you in their events.

1019
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:23,555
Me? An untamed staIIion
in a reaI rodeo? I wouId be honored!

1020
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,754
Lord, I hope that's mud!

1021
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,873
Hey, beefcake!
When you got to go, you got to go!

1022
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,475
What's he saying?

1023
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,200
He's just giving
a IittIe constructive criticism,..

1024
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,588
..but he says you're doing great.

1025
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,758
Like that. Can you try?

1026
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,190
I think you shouId waIk Iike a man.

1027
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,638
WeII, a Iot of good that does me.
I'm a rooster, remember?

1028
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,439
Come on, you can do it!

1029
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,035
Got it!

1030
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,834
Come on, puff that chest out!
Put your shouIders back!

1031
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,678
See, you know
what I'm taIking about!

1032
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,193
He says: ''Ease up on the reins
and stake back on the saddIe!''.

1033
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:33,079
UntiI he wants to throw, then he
shouId shift his weight forward.

1034
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,470
UntiI you want to throw,
then shift your weight forward!

1035
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,313
- TeII him to speed up!
- The cow wants you to speed up!

1036
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,835
Forget that!
TeII the stupid caIf to sIow down!

1037
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:53,230
On a personaI note, I wouId think
twice before caIIing a caIf stupid.

1038
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:54,833
Can't argue with you there.

1039
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,875
Left, Ieft, Ieft, right, Ieft.

1040
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,632
#I don't care
if you think it's true.#

1041
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,279
#You'II be cowboys
when you're through!#

1042
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,078
#We don't care
if you think it's true.#

1043
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,832
#We'II be cowboys
when we're through!#

1044
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,037
#I don't care where you've been.
Durango Ranch is going to win!#

1045
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:11,590
#We don't care where you've been.
Durango Ranch is going to win!#

1046
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,555
Like this?

1047
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,550
Now you know
what I'm taIking about! Let's go!

1048
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,835
Okay, I'm feeIing you.

1049
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,515
Thanks, girIfriend!

1050
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,955
That's great!

1051
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,315
That's it!

1052
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:46,949
Get you some of that!

1053
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,198
- I couId ride that thing.
- Yeah, if it's not moving.

1054
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:53,315
So are you nervous?

1055
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,629
A IittIe, I guess.

1056
01:10:58,680 --> 01:10:59,749
Why? Are you?

1057
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:02,835
WeII...

1058
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,949
I just don't want anybody
to get hurt out there.

1059
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,998
Don't worry about it too much.
I mean those guys shouId be fine.

1060
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,230
Yeah, weII, it's not them
that I'm worried about.

1061
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,279
Looks Iike she's about to sIip him
the oId tonguerooski.

1062
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,395
No, I wasn't!

1063
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,236
PIease, I may be from right here
in the good oId USA, but..

1064
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,353
..I have been to France
pIenty of times!

1065
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,636
You are one sick puppy,
do you know that?

1066
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:33,076
Rise and shine, Durangos,
it's winning time!

1067
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,755
Good morning and weIcome
to the SiIver Spurs annuaI rodeo!

1068
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,079
Today, Iadies and gentIemen,

1069
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:46,073
..competing in 2 rounds
of rodeo competitions!

1070
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,112
Good Iuck, tippers!

1071
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:52,751
- First up, the Iong horn roping event!
- Come on! Untie that IittIe doggie!

1072
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,031
Oh, Iooks Iike
it's gonna be cIose!

1073
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:05,955
Hey, not so tight! I bruise easy!

1074
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:09,715
- Go, boy!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

1075
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:13,476
Next up, it's the big man's event:
steer wrestIing!

1076
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,079
I'm going to own you, big boy!

1077
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,437
I'II have you know you're Iooking
at a three-time state wrestIing champ.

1078
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,272
I'II have you know I once shoved
a whoIe box of Twinkies in my mouth..

1079
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,395
..without swaIIowing them.

1080
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,278
First up, Chip Woodman!

1081
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:39,115
And that, Iadies and gentIemen,
is the new record: 5.4 seconds!

1082
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,235
Good Iuck!

1083
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,277
Go back. You missed the steer man!

1084
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:47,716
I don't know if we shouId give
that young man a hand or a cane!

1085
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,190
It's time for some barreI racing!

1086
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,195
Come on!

1087
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:00,595
Come on, boy!

1088
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:07,836
Coming in with a time of 1 6 seconds,
the SiIver Spurs!

1089
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,191
- Beat that!
- With pIeasure!

1090
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,913
Listen, BrookIyn, I know
you're not that crazy about me,..

1091
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,878
..and you think I'm some kind
of spoiIed brat or something,..

1092
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,635
..but I think
the way you ride is amazing.

1093
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,155
Thank you.

1094
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,550
Now get out there
and kicks some butt, wouId you?

1095
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,554
Come on, Iet's go!

1096
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,912
Come on, BrookIyn! You can do it!

1097
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,515
Go! Go!

1098
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,797
- Bring it in!
- Come on!

1099
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,476
1 3 seconds! What a great time!

1100
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,512
Looks Iike they've got a Ieaner.

1101
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,837
- Oh, dang it!
- What a bad break for the Durangos!

1102
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,513
I shouIdn't have cut it that cIose!

1103
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,354
It's okay. You did great!

1104
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,954
Despite the SiIver Spurs
is having a sIight Iead,..

1105
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,997
..the championship
is stiII wide open..

1106
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:11,789
..as we move into the second to Iast
event before everybody's favorite,..

1107
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,393
..the buII ride!
- Come on!

1108
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,875
Durangos, everybody huddIe up!
Come on, now!

1109
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,673
Look, we can stiII win this..

1110
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,638
..if we go into the buII ride
and be the second or third pIace.

1111
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,153
- But we're in Iast right now.
- Yeah.

1112
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:25,356
We're onIy 20 points away
from being in second.

1113
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,751
If we win every event from here on,
the money is ours.

1114
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:32,196
Come on now, put it in together!
Everybody! Durango on three!

1115
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:35,477
One, two, three. Durango!

1116
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,235
Hey, guys!

1117
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,435
I just wanted
to give you a IittIe heads up.

1118
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,751
I heard the SiIver Spurs are pIanning
on having veaI to ceIebrate.

1119
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,672
- What's veaI?
- You are, man.

1120
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,354
Forget that!
I'm nobody's main course, paI!

1121
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,159
One down, two to go.

1122
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:17,716
- Hey!
- Hey! You taIk to the steer?

1123
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,751
No, but I have a pIan.
I want you to cIose your eyes.

1124
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:23,989
Yeah, aIright.

1125
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,591
And I want you to picture donuts.

1126
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,829
But not just any donuts.
GIazed donuts.

1127
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,235
And not just any gIazed donuts.

1128
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,599
Fresh, hot out of the oven
gIazed donuts.

1129
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,117
- Now you are speaking my Ianguage.
- And most importantIy,..

1130
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,080
..I want you to picture
those hot gIazed donuts..

1131
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,635
..on the horns of this steer.

1132
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,275
Okay, Iet me at him!

1133
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,513
Come here, donuts!
I'II catch you!

1134
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,989
Ladies and gentIemen,
Iooks Iike we have a new record!

1135
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:06,152
3.4 seconds!

1136
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:10,877
Let's give it up for CIayton TayIor!

1137
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:15,118
Note to seIf: definiteIy
do not steaI their donuts either.

1138
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,550
Looks Iike it's time
for some barreI racing!

1139
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,392
Give our teams a round of appIause..

1140
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,199
..as they enter the ring
in order of the standings.

1141
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,555
Come on!

1142
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:34,879
Hey, what's the matter?

1143
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,839
It's my hand.
I think I busted it up.

1144
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,637
Okay, just Iet me take a Iook at it.

1145
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,631
Just be reaIIy carefuI
because it reaIIy hurts.

1146
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,272
Ow, Maya, God! That reaIIy hurts!

1147
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,479
- Can she ride?
- No. It's definiteIy broken.

1148
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,758
It's okay, guys. It's over, though.

1149
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,069
I'm sorry.

1150
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,189
No, it's not.

1151
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:06,868
Not yet, anyway.

1152
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:11,833
- Maya, what are you doing?
- Yeah, what are you doing?

1153
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,478
- WeIcome aboard.
- Thanks.

1154
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,273
What does it Iook Iike I'm doing?

1155
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,032
You haven't even trained
for this event!

1156
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,839
You said the hardest part
of barreI racing is the ground,..

1157
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,912
..so I just won't hit it.

1158
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,355
AIright.

1159
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,196
I'II go teII them
we have another rider.

1160
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,033
Just hoId on tight
and I'II take care of the rest.

1161
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,232
Sounds Iike a pIan.
Come on, Iet's go.

1162
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:40,472
Pay attention, and don't faII off,
or you'II be dead.

1163
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,914
What? You're just joking, right?

1164
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,676
Ladies and gentIemen,
BrookIyn Webster has a broken hand....

1165
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,432
- Mom?!
- Maya!

1166
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,351
You don't have to do this, you know.

1167
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,558
Yes, I do. If it was me,
you wouId have done the same thing.

1168
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,393
I've got to apoIogize for being
such a jerk to you aII summer.

1169
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,712
I'm not good at getting aIong
with peopIe when I'm jeaIous of them.

1170
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,873
I want you to go out there.
I want you to make us proud.

1171
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:06,955
I got you.

1172
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,429
The time to beat is 1 6 seconds.

1173
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,638
You were just kidding about
the whoIe ''die'' thing, right?

1174
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,032
HeIIo? Oh, no!

1175
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,154
Come on, Iet's go!

1176
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,589
Come on, Butch!

1177
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:33,078
Okay, make it happen!
You can do this!

1178
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:40,556
1 5.8 seconds for Maya DoIittIe!

1179
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:44,916
Oh my!
What a comeback for the Durangos!

1180
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:48,356
With that win they move into second
pIace in the overaII standing..

1181
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,953
..with just one event to go.

1182
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,873
That's right, foIks,
it's time for the buII ride!

1183
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,712
- ReIax, son.
- Yeah, teII that to him.

1184
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,473
Don't worry, I wiII.

1185
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,792
No. Maya, Iook. This is something
that I need to do on my own. Okay?

1186
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:33,669
Ride him!

1187
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,715
6 seconds, foIks. Not bad!

1188
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:42,237
And now the highIy anticipated
comeback ride of Bo Jones!

1189
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,509
This is for the whoIe enchiIada, foIks!
TaIk about pressure!

1190
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:48,915
Prepare to meet your maker.

1191
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,029
Are you sure
you don't want me to taIk to him?

1192
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,193
Why? Did he say something?

1193
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,549
Nothing you wanna hear.

1194
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:59,196
I'm not gonna Iie to you again.

1195
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,389
He said: ''Prepare to meet your maker'',
but he said it in a nice way.

1196
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,511
Great! I feeI better now!

1197
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,795
Stay on!

1198
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,077
Yeah! Stay on!

1199
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,275
Bo!

1200
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:42,913
Get up, son! Get up, Bo!

1201
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,475
Hey, guys, he's gone!

1202
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,228
Get up, son!

1203
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,635
- Bo! Wake up, Bo! Come on, son.
- Is he aIright?

1204
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:55,709
Wake up, son!

1205
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:03,554
It's officiaI, foIks: Bo Jones managed
to stay on for the fuII 8 seconds!

1206
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,675
You hear that, Bo?

1207
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,389
Son?

1208
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,872
Not bad for a has-been, huh?

1209
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:25,918
That means the winner of the 50,000
doIIar first prize is Jud Jones!

1210
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,513
I want to see a repIay.

1211
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,156
Boy, it just wouIdn't be our styIe
to go out any other way, wouId it?

1212
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,997
I want to hear it on three!
Durango on three!

1213
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:00,114
One, two, three. Durango!

1214
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:11,074
Ladies, I'II be back in a second. I'm just
going to step out for some fresh air.

1215
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:12,753
I've stiII got it...

1216
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:18,191
- So, Bo...
- Yes! - Where are we going?

1217
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:21,113
It wouIdn't be a surprise if I toId you
where we were going.

1218
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,517
I just wanted to thank you properIy
for heIping us save the ranch.

1219
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,669
You're weIcome.

1220
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,239
One second, sweetie...

1221
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:32,675
Thank you.

1222
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:46,629
Wait...

1223
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,594
You're weIcome.

1224
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:00,116
Did I ever teII you I've got a Iot
of other things to thank you for?

1225
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,269
Come on!

1226
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,198
Wait! Where is everybody anyway?

1227
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,717
Surprise!

1228
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,595
Oh, my God! It's my birthday party.
I compIeteIy forgot!

1229
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,553
Okay, who are you
and what have you done with Maya?

1230
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:31,829
- Happy birthday, girI!
- Oh, thank you so much.

1231
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,997
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

1232
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,275
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

1233
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:42,674
- Oh, Mommy! Thank you so much!
- Happy birthday!

1234
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,150
I didn't do it aII myseIf.
I had a IittIe heIp from your friends.

1235
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:52,478
Oh my gosh,
this is way better than any boat!

1236
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,232
- I know, right!
- I missed you!

1237
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,754
As soon as you two are done shrieking,
some foIks wouId Iike a word with you.

1238
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,548
Wait, I'II be right back.

1239
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:05,914
- You know you Iook the same
as you did when you were 1 6? - Thanks!

1240
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,310
And thanks for taking care
of my IittIe girI.

1241
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,552
It's kind of funny: she's the one
that's been taking care of us.

1242
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,075
Hey!

1243
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,870
Maya, for what you did,
this is our way of saying thanks.

1244
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:20,190
We'd have gotten you a gift
but we're broke!

1245
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:23,670
I shouId be thanking you, guys!
We couIdn't have done it without you!

1246
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,628
Nah, come on. Go on.
Enjoy your party. You deserve it!

1247
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:30,268
- AIright. I'II see you guys Iater.
- Bye, Maya.

1248
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,556
Hey, Maya,
thanks for heIping me find my Mojo!

1249
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:44,719
TeII me something I don't know!

1250
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,839
And so our story ends.

1251
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:17,193
Not reaIIy. You see, Bo is up to see
Maya every weekend from Stanford.

1252
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,239
BrookIyn and Maya taIk every day.
Go figure, huh?

1253
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,512
TyIer's coming back to Durango
next year to teach roping.

1254
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:26,314
And CIayton...
Iost his baby fat..

1255
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,948
..and he's now considered
quite the catch with the Iadies.

1256
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:31,629
But the important thing
is that Maya's doing great,..

1257
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:35,475
..happy to be exactIy who she is:
a DoIittIe.

1258
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:40,397
As for me, I'm stiII
the oId dog I've aIways been.

1259
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,757
OnIy now I've got a country gaI,..

1260
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,639
..who I Iike to visit
when the city babes get me down.

1261
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:49,270
City babes? You and me are going
to have taIk, Lucky DoIittIe.

1262
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:52,836
Women... Can't Iive with them,
can't Iive without them!
