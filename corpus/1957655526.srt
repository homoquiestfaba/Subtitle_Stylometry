00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,067
JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: There wasplenty of work for everyone

2
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:26,374
back then in World War II.

3
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:29,681
Those old Mississippi woods ofours were full of pine stumps.

4
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:32,510
And Leston and his men wouldblast them out to be turned

5
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:34,425
into turpentine for the war.

6
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:35,731
So long, Miss Jewel.

7
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:37,254
You take care now.

8
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:40,083
You take care.

9
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:42,346
All right, Nelson,
you and your boys

10
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:44,087

11
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:45,088
Yes, sir.

12
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:48,048
Come on.

13
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:49,353
OK, we're done.

14
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:53,705
Come on, boys, let's go.

15
00:00:53,836 --> 00:00:56,099
JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: Cathedraland me, we'd feed them,

16
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,579
send them off to work.

17
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:58,536
Everyday the same.

18
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:00,973
My wise best friend Cathe.

19
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:02,105
Midwifed all my babies.

20
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:03,889
Knew me inside out.

21
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,761
Kind of pekid this morning.

22
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:06,631
You all right?

23
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:08,155
I'm fine.

24
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:11,636
Let's go feed the younguns.

25
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:14,509
Long call for
breakfast this morning.

26
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:20,428
Bye, Miss Jewel.

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,311
JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: My
name is Jewel Hilburn.

28
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:38,098
This is a story about myfamily, about something that

29
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:40,187
happened to change us forever.

30
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:43,451
I guess it's a story about
love and letting God.

31
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:45,105
Here you go again.

32
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:46,758
Burton, Stop
tormenting your brother.

33
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:47,629
Wilman.

34
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,112
What's the matter with you two?

35
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:54,375
Every single morni-- putyour napkins in your lap.

36
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:56,028
Every single morning?

37
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,422
Every morning like
Cain and Abel.

38
00:01:58,553 --> 00:02:00,163
Here comes little fannywith her stinky old blanket.

39
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:01,730
Stop that.
Stop that.

40
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:06,952
You know them well.

41
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,345
Oh, children are children.

42
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:09,912
You were the same
when you was little.

43
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:11,131
I was not.

44
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:12,044
Oh, yes. you was.

45
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,133
I got a good memory.

46
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:14,482
I got a good memory.

47
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:15,918
You said so yourself.

48
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:18,312
God blessed you with a
good streak of mischief.

49
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:19,443
Uh-uhn.

50
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:21,750
Burton, give her blanket back.

51
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,707
I haven't got it, Mama.

52
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:24,970
Raylene?

53
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:26,842
I'm not gonna call you
no more this morning

54
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:27,756
for your breakfast.

55
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:29,714
I said I was coming.

56
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:33,022
You know, a woman can getenough sleep in this place.

57
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,024
Who's a woman?

58
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,199
Burton, Wilman,
y'all terrible.

59
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,069
Y'all terrible.

60
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:43,424
I know well thatchildren will be children.

61
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:44,381
Mama's girl.

62
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:45,252
Oh.

63
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:49,952
Dear Lord, here our prayer.

64
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:52,868
Give thanks for the manylessons you've bestowed told us.

65
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:54,826
We ask you to bless this
food for the nourishment

66
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:55,740
of our bodies.

67
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:56,611
Amen.

68
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:58,221
Amen.

69
00:02:58,352 --> 00:02:59,222
All right.

70
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:02,138
How was your day?

71
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,618
Almost forgot.

72
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:06,447
Almost forgot.

73
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:11,408
Dear Lord, please takegood care of the new life

74
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:12,540
that's within Mama.

75
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,454
Amen.

76
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,201
You all are kidding, right?

77
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:27,119
Oh my Lord.

78
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,556
What am I supposed totell my friends at school?

79
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:29,992
Huh?

80
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:31,689
Hey, y'all, guess what?

81
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,910
My Mama's having
yet another baby.

82
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,607
Yes, you are.

83
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:38,696
And you watch your
tongue, young lady.

84
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:40,263
Now, pass me those chops.

85
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:41,612
Yes, sir.

86
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:42,657
A baby?

87
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:44,006
A baby?

88
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:45,399
There's too many of
them here already.

89
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:48,619
The only baby I know
is sitting right there.

90
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,012
Burton, Wilman.

91
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:56,323
Now, Annie, don't you worry.

92
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:58,803
You're my baby girl.

93
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:01,676
Mama's always going to behere to take care of you.

94
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:03,068
You know that?

95
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:26,483
Cathedral?

96
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:33,490
First Corinthian, 15th
Chapter, fifth verse--

97
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:38,452
"Greater is he that
prophesieth than he

98
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:40,628
that speaketh with the tongue."

99
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:42,369
What?

100
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:45,502
The Lord put it in my mindto speak with you right now,

101
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:47,243
Miss Jewel.

102
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:50,899
Tell you about a hardship aboutto come down on you so hard,

103
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:55,338
not you or anybody elseis gonna be ready to bear.

104
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:57,297
Well, what do you mean?

105
00:04:57,427 --> 00:05:00,300
That child you's carrying.

106
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,304
That child gonna be your
hardship, Miss Jewel.

107
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:06,915
Gonna be your test
in this world.

108
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:08,569
What are you talking about?

109
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,050
The Lord tell me, he tellme to tell you, Miss Jewel.

110
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:14,052
He's smiling down on you.

111
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:16,533
You're scaring me, Cathedral.

112
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:19,971
Cathedral, you're scaring me.

113
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:21,408
What do you mean?

114
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:35,335
Burton?

115
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:36,292
Burton--

116
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:37,772
What's wrong, Mama?

117
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:39,295
Baby's coming.

118
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:42,516
You, oh, run to
Cathedral's house

119
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:48,478

120
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:54,484

121
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:55,529
Cathedral!

122
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:58,445
Come quick, the baby's coming.

123
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:00,142

Lord, have mercy.

126
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:14,374
[scream]

127
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:16,288
Baby breech, gotta

128
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:17,812
Breathe, Miss Jewel.

129
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:18,769
Breathe, Jewel.

130

Breathe.

131
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:21,293
Just breathe and pray.

132
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:24,253
This baby's not gonna beborn like the rest of them.

133
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,255
This baby breech.

134
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,736
Leston, gotta get
her to a doctor.

135
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,694
Baby breech.

136
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:34,916
Don't leave my babies
without a mother.

137
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:36,221
CATHEDRAL: Breathe.

138
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:37,179
Hang on, sugar.

139
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:38,615
Hang on.

140
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:41,401
If death is what you
want, take the child.

141
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:42,402
Dr. Beaudry!

142
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:43,403

Doctor.

146
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:47,842
Baby breech.
Breech baby.

147
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:49,104
Oh my.

148
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:50,410
- Yes?
- All right.

149
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,323
We can make it like this.Thank you.

150
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:52,760
We gotta take care of her.

151
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,067
All right, Miss Jewel,
relax and don't push.

152
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:58,113
Don't push.
Do not push.

153
00:06:58,243 --> 00:06:59,027
- Cathedral!- Doctor, I'll be right back.

154
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:00,245
Here we are.

155
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:01,421
All right, hold it
like that there.

156
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:02,378
Cathedral!

157
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:03,248
Don't push.

158
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:04,162
Don't push.

159
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:05,076
Short breaths.

160
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:06,600
There we are.
OK.

161
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,514
All right.

162
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:08,776
Baby's coming.

163
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:10,168
I can see it.

164
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:11,082
Cathedral!

165
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:12,040
Don't push.

166
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:12,997
Don't push.

167
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:13,911
I got it.

168
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:20,135
She is perfect.

169
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:23,747
Just perfect as all
the rest of them.

170
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:26,533
You slept the whole
day, you and she both.

171
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,012
It was a mighty
tough time you had.

172
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:32,539
How are the children?

173
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:34,758
They're fine.

174
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,631
They sent you those.

175
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:40,372
They're pretty.

176
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:41,591
I made you something too.

177
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:48,206
Oh, Leston.

178
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,034
Dogwood.

179
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:52,254
I picked it up on
the ground, knew

180
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:53,647
I could make something of it.

181
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:55,126
About time you carved
me something special.

182
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:03,657
Well, we need a
name for this baby.

183
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:05,397
She has her whole
life in front of her.

184
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:06,921
One day's already gone.

185
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:08,836
Isn't that right?

186
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,751
That's right.

187
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:13,580
How about Brenda Kay?

188
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,016
After your big sister?

189
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:16,278
Yeah.

190
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:19,237
She died giving child.

191
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:20,195
Brenda Kay.

192
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,330
I like it.

193
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:26,288
Brenda Kay it is.

194
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:28,290
I like that.

195
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,247
Don't you?

196
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:30,727
Hello, Brenda Kay.

197
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:39,127
Sh.
Sh.

198
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:40,215
He took my toy.

199
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:41,477
You're gonna wake Brenda Kay.

200
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:44,828
Oh, Mama, nothing
wakes Brenda Kay.

201
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,830
He's right.
She never moves.

202
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,882
She's sleepy all the time.

203
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:56,536
JEWEL: She's probably growing.

204
00:08:56,666 --> 00:09:00,104
I think I should give hermy blankie to help wake up.

205
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:03,760
Why, Annie, what
are you doing?

206
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:07,242
It's a present, so when shewakes up, she'll play with it.

207
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:09,331
You're a very
kind little girl.

208
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:10,375
You know that?

209
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:12,552
Well, she's my little sister.

210
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:17,078
Thank you.

211
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:24,085
Mama, Marianne's littleniece is five months old too.

212
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,653
She rolls around like a turtle.

213
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,350
This one likes to sleep.

214
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,831
She hasn't given us one abad night since she was born.

215
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,833
You should be grateful.

216
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:33,660
I guess so.

217
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:38,926
All babies are different.

218
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:39,753
They's all diff--

219
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:13,830
Something's wrong, Leston.

220
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,093
Even little Annie knows it.

221
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:20,228
The only time she
wakes up is to nurse.

222
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:23,884
She can't even roll over yet.

223
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:27,104
She's not nearly as far alongas the rest of them were.

224
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:28,584
We'll take her to the doctor.

225
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:52,695
Well I don't know.

226
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,349
I'd like a friend of mineto take a look at Brenda

227
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:57,091
Kay, Dr. Floyd Basket.

228
00:10:57,221 --> 00:11:01,486
He is the best baby
specialist in the south.

229
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:04,489
You just examined her,
what's wrong with her?

230
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,884
I'm not ducking your question,but I don't want to guess.

231
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:10,539
Go ahead and guess, Doctor.

232
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,541
No, I will not.

233
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,718
Look, I'm a small town
doctor, Mr. Hilburn,

234
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:18,416
and what this little girlneeds is someone better

235
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:21,506
prepared to say what's wrong.

236
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:24,945
She's-- she's going to
be all right, isn't she?

237
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:26,555
I'm sure she will.

238
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,645
Now, Dr. Basket was my teacher,and he's in New Orleans,

239
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:33,301
but I'm sure he'll come upand see Brenda Kay as a favor

240
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:34,824
if I ask him.

241
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:36,260
Thank you.

242
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:38,175
That will be fine.

243
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:39,350
Thank you, Doctor.

244
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:40,351
Thank you.

245
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:52,467
Well, now, Dr. Beaudry
tells me I need to have

246
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:54,034
a look see at this baby.

247
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:55,600
Yes, sir.

248
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:56,514
Ma'am.

249
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:49,872
All right, you
can take her now.

250
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,141
It's OK.

251
00:13:58,272 --> 00:14:00,056
That's my little girl.

252
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:06,106
What I have to
tell you it is not

253
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:11,111
easy to hear, but necessary.

254
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:12,982
Hands.

255
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:15,289
Our hands tell us much.

256
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:17,378
Brenda Kay's hands do, too.

257
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:21,077
They tell us that we can'talways depend on nature.

258
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,601
Sometimes, things go wrong.

259
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:31,000
Brenda Kay is a Mongolian idiot.

260
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:35,918
What do you mean?

261
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:39,530
Means she is mentally
and physically retarded.

262
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:44,187
She'll never progressed muchbeyond where she is right now.

263
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:49,889
Flat, broad hands, smallertoes, drastically curved in.

264
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,456
Eyes slanting upwards.

265
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:54,415
Extreme case.

266
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:59,594
And so it's-- it's very hardfor me to tell you this.

267
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:01,726
She is unlikely to
live past two years.

268
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:08,429
It was a difficult birth.

269
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,997
She's a breech baby.

270
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:13,129
That's why her face
looks like this.

271
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,697
That's why she's not right.

272
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:17,220
That's right.

273
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:18,178
No, Mrs. Hilburn.

274
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:19,570
Yes.

275
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:21,137
One thing we know
about this condition,

276
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:25,402
is that it's present
at conception.

277
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,709
I have to tell you thatthe best thing you can do

278
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,842
is give her up to
an institution.

279
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,410
She'll be a huge burdenon you, and you have four

280
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,804
other children to consider.

281
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,849
Institution?

282
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,853
An institution will
know how to care for her

283
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:44,291
and tend to her.

284
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:45,553
That's not right.

285
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:46,902
You're-- you're wrong.

286
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,730
Goodbye, Doctor.

287
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,558
She's gonna be-- she's
gonna be fine, Sugar.

288
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:51,472
No.

289
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:02,004
Dr. Beaudry can reach
me, if you need me.

290
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:20,631
I fixed you some nice,
hot soup, Miss Jewel.

291
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:22,546
Come on now, you
gotta eat something.

292
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:23,417
Keep your strength.

293
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:29,727
Asked the Savior
to help your child.

294
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:30,815
Surely carry you through.

295
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:31,686
Jewel?

296
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:35,472
It's Dr. Beaudry.

297
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,439
You knew, didn't you?

298
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:48,181
And you didn't have
the guts to tell me.

299
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:51,358
If you've come here
to take away my baby,

300
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:53,708
you can just head
on out right now.

301
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:56,754
If you want to keep thisbaby, Dr. Basket and I

302
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:59,627
want you to know that we willhelp you whatever ways we can.

303
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:01,890
What ways might those be?

304
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,196
Jewel.

305
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,198
Well, I'd like to
see her every month,

306
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:07,200
Dr. Basket every three months.

307
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:10,377
And there are injections we cangive her, calcium gluconate,

308
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:12,596
to strengthen her bones.

309
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:17,079
See, one of the problemswith the Mongolian idiot--

310
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:24,043
Don't you ever say thosewords in front of me again.

311
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:25,435
Don't you dare.

312
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:35,097
Children of this nature
have very soft bones.

313
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:37,404
The shots will help,
every six weeks.

314
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:44,106
But these shots aren't cheap,and we're going to have to talk

315
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:45,629
about how much they cost.

316
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,155
No, we do not.

317
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:52,810
We'll do whatever
has to be done, Doctor.

318
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:54,073
All right.

319
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:55,074
Thank you, Doctor.

320
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:04,300
Leston, we can beat this.

321
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:08,870
We can fix it.

322
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,871
We can.

323
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:11,786
If we just love her enough.

324
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:18,662
Can we?

325
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,848
JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: Those boneinjections hurt Little Brenda

326
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:34,113
Kay bad, but I was
bound and determined

327
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:36,767
she wasn't going to
die before she was two,

328
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:38,595
the way they said she would.

329
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:40,554
And she didn't die.

330
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:42,077
She hung on.

331
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:52,566
So we paid for those
shots for years.

332
00:18:52,696 --> 00:18:54,829
Leston had no work
when the war ended,

333
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:57,353
and money was really tight.

334
00:18:57,484 --> 00:19:00,051
Raylene left school
and took a job,

335
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,880
and the younguns sold
vegetables we grew.

336
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:06,145
I took in sewing, and I
looked after Brenda Kay.

337
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,330
She was slow to crawl,
she didn't lift her head

338
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,332
until she was 1 year old.

339
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:23,423
Didn't walk until she was 4,and every minute of every year,

340
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:25,207
I had to be there.

341
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:29,516
To change her, bathe
here, feed her by hand,

342
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:30,778
rock her when she screamed.

343
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,043
There was no let up.

344
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:35,913
Ever.

345
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:43,356
Two, three.

346
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,749
Can you take another
big step for me, baby?

347
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:57,500
One, two, come on,
one, two, one, two.

348
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:00,373
You can't get that child todo something she can't do,

349
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:02,288
Miss Jewel.

350
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:05,508
She's gonna walk,
and she's gonna run.

351
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:06,988
I promise.

352
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:08,816
Just takes a little time.

353
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:10,209
Your sons been
playing football

354
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:12,689
on the football field
for almost a year,

355
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,517
and you ain't seen
neigh one of them.

356
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:15,431
Not one.

357
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:16,650
Leston goes.

358
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,348
I'm just a little tired.

359
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,915
You wanna walk again?

360
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:23,831
Look, Cathedral, you watch.

361
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:25,441
Let's take a step.

362
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:27,138
One.

363
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,445
Take a step for Mama.

364
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:31,969
One.

365
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,667
JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: Whathad I done wrong to produce

366
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:36,060
this different little girl?

00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:38,454
I wanted to make things right.

368
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:43,154
Most of all, I wanted herto feel loved, and she did.

369
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,721
I know.

370
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:47,202
But it was five years beforeshe took her first step

371
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,899
and said her first word.

372
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,771
Mama.

373
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:52,381
Say Mama?

374
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:55,515
Brenda Kay, Mama.

375
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:56,516
Mama.

376
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:57,473
Mama!

377
00:20:57,604 --> 00:21:00,389
Mama.

378
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,870
You did it.

379
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,698
JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: Whenmost kids are 7-years-old,

380
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:07,440
they're going into
the second grade.

381
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,094
When Brenda Kay was
seven, she walked down

382
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,313
the stairs for the first time.

383
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:16,492
One at a time.

384
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:17,406
OK.

385
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:18,320
Burton.

386
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:19,234
Good girl.

387
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:20,235
You're doing it, honey.

388
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,105
Good.

389
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:27,460
Slowly.

390
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,374
All right.

391
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:33,379
My clever girl.

392
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:34,989
First time.

393
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,512
Praise be to God.

394
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:38,949
You did it.

395
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,255
Good girl.

396
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:43,258
I think that calls
for a celebration.

397
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:45,652
How about a picnic on Saturday?

398
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:49,569
Let's have chicken, friedchicken, potato salad,

399
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,397
maybe Cathedral will makeus some of her cookies.

400
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:52,267
Wow.

401
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:55,009
Mama, really?

402
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:56,793
Your bus is here, babies.

403
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:02,190
Cathedral, I'm
leaving for work.

404
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,976
Oh, Miss Jewel,
your magazine come.

405
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:07,195
Good.

406
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,762
Can I borrow one
of your hairpins?

407
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:11,852
On, yeah, sure, of course.

408
00:22:11,982 --> 00:22:12,766
This one be enough?

409
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:14,289
That's great.

410
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,204
I saved the last
magazine for you.

411
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,510
Oh, thank you.

412
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,511
I really shouldn't get them.

413
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:19,947
It's such an extravagance.

414
00:22:20,077 --> 00:22:21,862
Well, now, I will not
have you saying anything

415
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:23,603
wrong about those magazines.

416
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:25,822
You taught me how
to read with those.

417
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:28,042
And now I'm teaching,
Sepulchral, my youngest.

418
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:29,478
Did you know that?

419
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:32,002
Oh, Miss Jewel, I
am so proud of him.

420
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:35,223
He is such a good study.

421
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,225
I think about how
little I pay you.

422
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,053
Well, now, you go on.

423
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:40,446
Hard as you work?

424
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:41,708
You're like to do
something for yourself.

425
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:46,756
If Leston and yourNelson can pick firewood,

426
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:49,150
I guess I can wait tables.

427
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,326
Just go on.

428
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:54,460
Brenda Kay and me, we gonnamake her favorite oatmeal

429
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,374
for lunch today.

430
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,160
See you later.

431
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,030
God bless.

432
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:06,689
Leston?

433
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,517
Hm-huh.

434
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:10,780
It says here there's a specialschool for children like Brenda

435
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:13,827
Kay, raises their IQ.

436
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:16,699
It's like a miracle, it says.

437
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,441
No miracles outside
the Bible, Miss jewel.

438
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:22,009
There's an
address to write to.

439
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:24,751
Oh, imagine if she could
go to a place like that.

440
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:26,709
Nearest thing to a miraclehas been being able to stop

441
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,755
those bone shots last year.

442
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:31,671
Of course, we'd alreadygone broke paying for them.

443
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:32,672
Leston?

444
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:34,630
Well, I've got no regrets.

445
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:36,110
None at all.

446
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:41,985
This picnic you're
having on Saturday?

447
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:43,813
Uh-huh?

448
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:47,251
I figured we'd rent a boat andhave [inaudible] on the lake.

449
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:48,557
Without no money?

450
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:50,211
I got a few cents raised.

451
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:53,040
Just a few.

452
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,608
Children would like that.

453
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:58,567
I thought you and
me could take a ride.

454
00:23:58,698 --> 00:24:02,397
Just you and me, like old times.

455
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,355
Like before we were married.

456
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:14,148
I'll get some wood for the fire.

457
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:23,897
Raven.

458
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:24,811
OK.

459
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:26,160
Say hallelujah.

460
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,161
Holler.

461
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,685
OK, let's go.

462
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:33,080
Hallelujah, Brenda Kay.

463
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,517
Hallelujah, rainbow.

464
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:37,476
JEWEL: Hallelujah, mommy.

465
00:24:37,606 --> 00:24:39,390
BRENDA KAY: Hallelujah, mommy.

466
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,828
Hallelujah, Daddy.

467
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:44,744
Hallelujah.

468
00:24:44,874 --> 00:24:47,224
JEWEL: Hallelujah, Raylene.

469
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:48,661
BRENDA KAY: Hallelujah, Raylene.

470
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:51,185
Good girl.

471
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:53,840
Hallelujah, Burton.

472
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,843
Hallelujah, Burton.

473
00:24:56,973 --> 00:24:59,933
Hallelujah, Brenda Kay.

474
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:01,456
BRENDA KAY:
Hallelujah, Brenda Kay.

475
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:02,413
Hallelujah, honey.

476
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:05,591
It's our turn.

477
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:06,766
But, Brenda Kay--

478
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:08,681
Mama, she'll be
just fine with us.

479
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:10,247
She has four people.

480
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:12,989
Will you play with Raylene?

481
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,947
Go on.

482
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:15,165
Play hallelujah?

483
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:16,079
OK.

484
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:21,694
I love you.

485
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:23,739
You love me.

486
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,393
Bye bye.

487
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,395
OK, take care.

488
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,527
Bye, Mama.

489
00:25:28,657 --> 00:25:30,616
- Bye bye.
- Y'all don't worry.

490
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:34,924
She'll be fine.

491
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:36,143
She'll be just fine.

492
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:46,545
Hallelujah.

493
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:54,683
Mr. Hilburn,
how have you been?

494
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:58,905
Why, just fine, Miss Jewel.

495
00:25:59,035 --> 00:26:01,908
All the better for
being here with you.

496
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:05,259
I don't know when we werelast on our own together.

497
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:06,739
Seems like it never happens.

498
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:11,352
But we're here now, out
on the peaceful water.

499
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:12,701
Under the peaceful willow.

500
00:26:15,835 --> 00:26:16,618
Yes, we are.

501
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:20,579
Yes, we are.

502
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:27,803
Jewel, I miss you, Jewel.

503
00:26:31,981 --> 00:26:32,765
Hello, Leston.

504
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:51,131
[bird cry]

505
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:28,908
Leston, I think we coulddo better by our family.

506
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:31,780
How so?

507
00:27:31,911 --> 00:27:38,178
I have an idea that we oughtto think of moving from here,

508
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:41,268
from Mississippi.

509
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:44,619
And move to New Orleans?

510
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,926
Driving down there everyfew weeks to see a doctor

511
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,884
don't mean we necessarily
have to move there.

512
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:50,190
No.

513
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,585
Not New Orleans, but
somewhere there's

514
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:58,111
an opportunity for things.

515
00:27:58,241 --> 00:28:01,114
What things?

516
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:05,509
Oh, Oh, good care,
special school

517
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,860
for Brenda Kay, jobs too.

518
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,730
Good jobs.

519
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:14,649
Who put these big
ideas into your head?

520
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,303
No one.

521
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:17,739
That magazine article.

522
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,004
That school in California.

523
00:28:28,837 --> 00:28:30,317
Don't be foolish, Jewel.

524
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:38,412
California?

525
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:40,675
You too?

526
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:42,155
What's wrong with this family?

527
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:43,417
Los Angeles.

528
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:45,724
Now, Pete Jackson's
going with me.

529
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:47,377
Bought an old pickup
between us and we're

530
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:48,770
almost done fixing it up.

531
00:28:48,901 --> 00:28:50,076
LESTON: Did your mother
put you up to this?

532
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:54,428
No I may have mentioned
the school, but--

533
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:56,560
It was my idea.

534
00:28:56,691 --> 00:28:58,475
There's jobs out there, Daddy.

535
00:28:58,606 --> 00:28:59,389
I can do well.

536
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,260
I know it.

537
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,827
Send money home.

538
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,263
What if I say no?

539
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:04,917
I'm 18 years old, Daddy.

540
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:06,614
I'm old enough to be in thearmy, old enough to drink.

541
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,375
It wasn't me.

542
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:30,551
I didn't know he was
planning to leave.

543
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:36,513
10 men I had
working for me once.

544
00:29:36,644 --> 00:29:37,645
I was always figured
the boys would

545
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,822
follow me into the business.

546
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:41,867
But that's all gone.

547
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:47,133
Times are hard
for everyone, honey.

548
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:51,877
I guess.

549
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:57,317
But nothing's worked out
the way I planned it.

550
00:29:57,447 --> 00:29:58,187
Nothing.

551
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,672
It's from Burton.

552
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,542
His cards.

553
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:09,590
Annie.
- Oh, would you open--

554
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,460
OK.

555
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:11,810
Sorry, sorry.

556
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,637
This time it's Mom
and Daddy's turn.

557
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:16,727
Things are just
fine, love Burton.

558
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,729
Oh, Mama, look.

559
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,730
Oh.

560
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:20,688
Oh my.

561
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:27,608
Lady nice.

562
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:29,523
Oh, Mama.

563
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:33,483
Look at you.

564
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:35,094
This is the
present your brother

565
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:38,793
Burton sent your Daddy allthe way from Los Angeles,

566
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:40,751
California.

567
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:45,713
It's a mighty fine lighter.

568
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,715
Put some fuel inside.

569
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:55,810
This is how it works, you see.

570
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,684
Watch this.

571
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:09,955
Isn't that nice?

572
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:11,608
Mighty fine lighter.

573
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:16,526
Your Mama is real proudof them cards from her boy.

574
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:19,051
Your brother Burton
is a good boy.

575
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:23,664
He remembers everybody andhe lets us all know that he

576
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:24,970
thinking about us all the time.

577
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,628
Take care, don't scratch
them now, Brenda Kay.

578
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,370
Can't believe how thesechildren are just growing.

579
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:37,504
Seems like just the otherday, house full of babies

580
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:39,593
all over the place now.

581
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:11,973
Lord, have mercy.

582
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:12,974
Hold on, baby.

583
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:13,975
I'm coming.

584
00:32:14,106 --> 00:32:15,542
I'm coming.

585
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:16,412
Kay.

586
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:18,937
Brenda Kay?

587
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:21,417
Oh, baby.

588
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:22,941
Baby.

589
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:25,378
Are you all right?

590
00:32:25,508 --> 00:32:27,902
Does it hurt?

591
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:31,384
I'm sorry.

592
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:33,952
How could you?

593
00:32:34,082 --> 00:32:37,172
How could you?

594
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:38,957
We have to look out
for her all the time.

595
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:42,612
Cathedral.

596
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:48,575
You OK?

597
00:32:48,705 --> 00:32:50,055
Yes, Miss Jewel.

598
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:57,497
I'm sorry, baby.

599
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:07,463
Brenda Kaye is healingup nicely now, ain't she?

600
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:08,943
Yeah.

601
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:10,684
That Dr. Beaudry says
she's going to be fine.

602
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,385
Would you look at
this dress of Annie's?

603
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:19,649
I don't think she's gonna bewearing this too much longer.

604
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,130
Oh, Brenda Kay's going
to be wearing it soon.

605
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:29,877
Where's she gone to now?

606
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,358
Brenda Kay?

607
00:33:32,488 --> 00:33:33,794
Brenda Kay?

608
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:34,795
Brenda Kay?

609
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,714
Wilman, Brenda
Kay's gone missing.

610
00:33:40,844 --> 00:33:41,758
Go look out back, OK?

611
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:42,585
Mama, I gotta meet Charlie.

612
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:44,109
You just go look.

613
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:45,110
Brenda Kay!

614
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,024
Brenda Kay.

615
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:10,700
Brenda Kay.

616
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:11,701
Brenda Kay?

617
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:18,926
Brenda Kay!

618
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:24,323
Brenda Kay.

619
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:38,598
Wilman.

620
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:42,993
What on earth happened to you?

621
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:44,604
You're a bad girl, Brenda Kay.

622
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:46,519
You know you're not supposedto just go off like that.

623
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:48,086
What's the matter with you?

624
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:49,174
And look at your clothes.

625
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:50,088
You're all wet.

626
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:54,396
You don't know, do you?

627
00:34:54,527 --> 00:34:58,487
Mom was just worried about you.

628
00:34:58,618 --> 00:34:59,836
I love you.

629
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:02,056
I love you too.

630
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:04,232
OK, you go on in and
get your clothes dry.

631
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:05,277
Go in to Cathedral.

632
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:13,285
You're a good boy, Wilman.

633
00:35:13,415 --> 00:35:16,679
Mama, she just
walked and walked.

634
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,854
If I wasn't following
her, she would

635
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:20,248
have just drown in that swamp.

636
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:22,946
It was scary.

637
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:27,125
What's gonna become
of her, Mama?

638
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:28,822
Sweetheart, don't worry.

639
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:33,914
If we all just love her enough,she's gonna be just fine.

640
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:35,350
You're all wet.

641
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:37,309
Go change your clothes
and go meet your friend.

642
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:38,223
Have some fun.

643
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:06,076
Cathedral, guess what?

644
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,862
I'm giving up my sewing job.

645
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:11,952
I shan't need you to watchover Brenda Kay anymore.

646
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:14,824
You can't get up
that job, Miss Jewel.

647
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:17,479
You need the money.

648
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,395
Well, I got a letter.

649
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:21,701
They have a place
for Brenda Kay,

650
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:23,964
that special school
in California,

651
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:26,749
the one for
exceptional children.

652
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,969
Exceptional, you hear that?

653
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:30,884
Isn't that wonderful?

654
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:34,104
You're taking your
child to California?

655
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:36,368
Yeah, I guess.

656
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:39,545
Mr. Leston know it?

657
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:40,459
Not yet.

658
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:46,682
Lord is trying his best tosmile down on you, Miss Jewel.

659
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:49,250
You just won't let
him do that, will ya?

660
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:50,164
Is that what is it?

661
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:51,557
Smiling?

662
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:52,645
Sure.

663
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:56,475
That God smiling on you, child.

664
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:58,607
Well, I think you and
I have different ideas

665
00:36:58,738 --> 00:37:01,523
about God, Cathedral.

666
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:06,833
I think you need to go backto your Bible, and read Job.

667
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:10,967
God gives us all burdens.

668
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:12,708
You're carrying yours
like it's a cause.

669
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,014
It ain't.

670
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:16,756
It's just God's will.

671
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:19,237
God's will.

672
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:20,977
You think God was
smiling on Brenda

673
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:22,718
Kay when he led her get burned?

674
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:25,895
It was His grace that keptthis house from burning down.

675
00:37:26,026 --> 00:37:26,853
Yeah, with you watching.

676
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,781
You can't choose
that baby, Miss Jewel.

677
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:46,786
Whatever you do, whereveryou go, you can't change her.

678
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:48,744
She's the way God made her.

679
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,529
And you're just going tohave to love her that way.

680
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:54,924
You know nothing.

681
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:58,406
Nothing.

682
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:09,548
Nothing.

683
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:10,418
Nothing.

684
00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:31,918
Leston?

685
00:38:32,048 --> 00:38:33,398
Are you OK?

686
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:41,362
What are you doing up?

687
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:42,320
What is it?

688
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:47,586
The clock.

689
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:50,415
My mother and stepfather gaveus that clock as a wedding gift.

690
00:38:53,243 --> 00:38:54,288
They're dead now.

691
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:59,119
At least tell me how
much you got for it.

692
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:08,607
I don't want you to think--

693
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:10,739
How much?

694
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,653
$12.

695
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:21,402
So the clock, twovases, the rocking chair,

696
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:26,059
and all the pickle and corn,all the boys' old things.

697
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:28,540
Anything else I'm missing?

698
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,063
My gold cross necklace.

699
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,725
Come outside with me.

700
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:06,229
You figure I can't see what thehell is going on around here?

701
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,840
All your sales?

702
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,930
All your stupid dreams ofgoing to sunny California?

703
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,800
How much you got?

704
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:16,457
About $73.

705
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:18,590
That's more than I figured.

706
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,070
I had it about $65.

707
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:23,377
You must be holding out on me.

708
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:26,467
I sold the hat that
Burton gave me for $6.

709
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:29,470
And not a word to me?

710
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:31,516
You wanna shut me
out of your life?

711
00:40:31,646 --> 00:40:32,908
No.

712
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,083
Then what?

713
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:36,129
You wouldn't listen.

714
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:37,522
I wouldn't listen?

715
00:40:37,652 --> 00:40:41,003
Did you talk to me,
or just to yourself?

716
00:40:41,134 --> 00:40:43,832
Leston, I'm sorry.

717
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:46,487
You want to sell everything.

718
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:49,229
Everything we own.

719
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,713
Well, there are two things youcan't sell unless I say so.

720
00:40:54,843 --> 00:41:00,240
One is this lighter my boy gaveme, the other is this place.

721
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:05,027
This place that I built for us.

722
00:41:05,158 --> 00:41:07,334
It's what you want
to do, isn't it?

723
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:11,730
You want to sell this place,this house, this land?

724
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,471
Yes.

725
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:16,604
I want us to give Brenda Kaya chance for a proper life.

726
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:20,521
The way she is,
that's our doing.

727
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:21,957
We have to make her better.

728
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,102
Well, all right, all right.

729
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:39,409
You're not the only onewho's been thinking, Jewel.

730
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,108
So I'll make a bargain with you.

731
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:43,675
We'll go.

732
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:47,287
I'll put this place onthe market, and we'll go.

733
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:48,680
Maybe Burton is right.

734
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:50,856
Maybe I will find some

00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,031
I love you.

922
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:03,990
I love you too.

923
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,513
Pretty girl.

924
00:52:05,644 --> 00:52:06,993
OK, let's go.

925
00:52:22,748 --> 00:52:24,750
Excuse me.

926
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,578
We're here to see Nathan White.

927
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:27,666
We have an appointment.
Mrs.

928
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:29,233
Hilburn?
Welcome.

929
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:30,973
Good morning.

930
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:34,325
I'm May, Mr. White's assistant,and this must be Brenda Kay.

931
00:52:34,455 --> 00:52:35,195
Cathedral Mama?

932
00:52:38,633 --> 00:52:41,027
Oh, no, not Cathedral.

933
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,637
She thinks your
Cathedral, our house

934
00:52:42,768 --> 00:52:44,291
cleaning woman in Mississippi.

935
00:52:49,862 --> 00:52:52,299
She's also my friend.

936
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:55,389
Well, come along then,
he's expecting you.

937
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,477
Hi.

938
00:52:56,608 --> 00:52:57,739
Will come for a walk with me?

939
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:59,437
That's it, in a
nutshell, Mrs. Hilburn.

940
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:01,700
We test our children, and wefind the right level for them

941
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:04,485
to reach, then we teach them.

942
00:53:04,616 --> 00:53:05,878
Can you teach Brenda Kay?

943
00:53:06,008 --> 00:53:07,140
Of course.

944
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:09,229
She's clearly ready for it.

945
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,275
Enroll her as soon as you can.

946
00:53:11,405 --> 00:53:14,191
How much will it cost?

947
00:53:14,321 --> 00:53:16,018
Mama, sh.

948
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:19,413
You, uh, you pay whatyou can afford, that's all.

949
00:53:19,544 --> 00:53:21,763
That's all?

950
00:53:21,894 --> 00:53:23,983
It may not be very much.

951
00:53:24,113 --> 00:53:25,637
Public education
does absolutely

952
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:29,989
nothing for these children,so I do, with my associates.

953
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:31,991
I had a little brother,who was committed to a home

954
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:33,645
when he was one-month-old.

955
00:53:33,775 --> 00:53:35,516
That's what we were told
to do with Brenda Kay.

956
00:53:35,647 --> 00:53:37,953
It was a good
place, but no one

957
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:40,129
there ever understood how tokeep that little spark in him

958
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,566
alive.

959
00:53:41,696 --> 00:53:45,787
He lived there till he
died at the age of 21.

960
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:49,269
I've never forgotten
that, so here I am.

961
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,097
Thank you, Mr. White.

962
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,925
Thank you very much.

963
00:53:53,055 --> 00:53:54,405
Brenda Kay would
you like to go

964
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:56,320
and look at Mrs. Hamby's class?

965
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:59,540
School, like Wilman and Annie.

966
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:00,759
Wilman and Annie.

967
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:01,629
Yes.

968
00:54:04,589 --> 00:54:06,547
And when they came to thecorner of Beacon Street,

969
00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:08,810
there was the police
car with four policemen

970
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:11,073
that Clanton had sent
from headquarters.

971
00:54:13,815 --> 00:54:15,252
Well, class, we have visitors.

972
00:54:19,995 --> 00:54:21,432
Hi.

973
00:54:21,562 --> 00:54:24,043
I'm Mrs. Hilburn, and thisis Brenda Kay Hilburn.

974
00:54:24,173 --> 00:54:24,957
Welcome, Brenda Kay.

975
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:32,399
Kay, OK.

976
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:33,270
Kay.

977
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,749
[giggle]

978
00:54:45,543 --> 00:54:46,718
JEWEL [VOICEOVER]:
Seven years went by

979
00:54:46,848 --> 00:54:49,416
and suddenly it was the 60s.

980
00:54:49,547 --> 00:54:52,724
Brenda Kay stayed in school,and her spark stayed alive,

981
00:54:52,854 --> 00:54:54,291
I guess.

982
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:57,163
But that miracle I'd hopefor, it didn't happen.

983
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:01,210
Even Mr. Nathan White'sschool couldn't raise her IQ.

984
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:03,430
She was happy enough,
and Mr. White took

985
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:05,780
me on as an assistant teacher.

986
00:55:05,911 --> 00:55:08,609
Leston went from truck drivingto being head of maintenance

987
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,089
at a city college.

988
00:55:10,219 --> 00:55:13,222
Burton was married, had a baby.

989
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:16,182
Annie got engaged to a policemanwho wrote her a ticket,

990
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,314
and then asked her for a date.

991
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:25,409
And Brenda Kay Hilburn, she was16-years-old, but only in body.

992
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:27,889
Jimmy, you go over
to the painting table.

993
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,021
Laura, come on over.

994
00:55:29,151 --> 00:55:30,762
Cindy.

995
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:33,068
Randy, you wanna sit over there?

996
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,635
And where's Brenda Kay?

997
00:55:34,766 --> 00:55:35,506
And Dennis?

998
00:55:38,987 --> 00:55:39,771
Oh, Lord.

999
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,383
Brenda Kay.

1000
00:55:43,514 --> 00:55:44,253
Brenda Kay.

1001
00:55:44,384 --> 00:55:45,690
Brenda Kay.

1002
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:46,560
Stop that, you two.

1003
00:55:46,691 --> 00:55:47,953
Go on, go sit down.

1004
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:50,085
Go sit at the table.

1005
00:55:50,216 --> 00:55:52,523
Dennis, you know we don'thold hands like that here.

1006
00:55:58,267 --> 00:56:01,270
You wanna sit over here?

1007
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:02,184
Take your time with that.

1008
00:56:06,537 --> 00:56:10,279
Dennis, you want?

1009
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:11,890
Brenda Kay, I made thosecookies just for you.

1010
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:16,111
If you don't want this cookie,I'll go ahead and have it.

1011
00:56:19,506 --> 00:56:20,246
Thank you, Brenda Kay.

1012
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:26,731
Mr. White?

1013
00:56:30,082 --> 00:56:32,127
There's something I'dlike to talk to you about.

1014
00:56:32,258 --> 00:56:33,825
Well, go right ahead.

1015
00:56:33,955 --> 00:56:36,262
I caught Dennis andBrenda Kay holding hands.

1016
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,176
Well, they're friends.

1017
00:56:37,306 --> 00:56:39,004
They like each other.

1018
00:56:39,134 --> 00:56:41,398
Yes, but they're also 16.

1019
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:42,703
They're bodies are changing.

1020
00:56:42,834 --> 00:56:44,618
It makes me nervous.

1021
00:56:44,749 --> 00:56:47,012
Well, holding hands is
pretty innocent stuff.

1022
00:56:47,142 --> 00:56:48,361
That's true, but--

1023
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:50,319
But she's your
daughter, and not mine.

1024
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:51,190
That's right.

1025
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,888
I know.

1026
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:55,586
But she's getting older, Jewel.

1027
00:56:55,716 --> 00:56:57,718
You're going to have to startthinking about the future.

1028
00:56:57,849 --> 00:56:59,067
Now, there's a couple
in Santa Barbara

1029
00:56:59,198 --> 00:57:01,200
named Larry and Nancy Tindle.

1030
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,158
They have a beautiful
residential home, four

1031
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:05,117
or five girls all
with special needs

1032
00:57:05,247 --> 00:57:06,379
living together like a family.

1033
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:07,424
Brenda Kay has a family.

1034
00:57:13,908 --> 00:57:16,128
You all keep an eye
out there for Gene.

1035
00:57:16,258 --> 00:57:18,957
He is not seeing this
dress until tomorrow.

1036
00:57:19,087 --> 00:57:20,524
Ow.
Oh.

1037
00:57:20,654 --> 00:57:21,438
Sarah, you stuck me.

1038
00:57:21,568 --> 00:57:22,569
I'm sorry, Annie.

1039
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,527
Hey, Annie?

1040
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:24,789
Yeah?

1041
00:57:24,919 --> 00:57:26,530
Gained some weight, huh?

1042
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,575
Burton.

1043
00:57:28,706 --> 00:57:29,620
Y'all.

1044
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,666
You're never gonna lose that.

1045
00:57:32,797 --> 00:57:33,798
Damn right, we ain't.

1046
00:57:33,928 --> 00:57:37,105
Burt, watch your mouth.

1047
00:57:37,236 --> 00:57:39,456
Uncle Will, what
are you doing?

1048
00:57:39,586 --> 00:57:40,587
You're ruining her picture.

1049
00:57:40,718 --> 00:57:41,849
Yes, I am.

1050
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:42,981
You know, your
daughter weighs a ton?

1051
00:57:43,111 --> 00:57:44,330
I'll put her down soon.

1052
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,810
No, she's all right.

1053
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:46,680
Hey, Annie?

1054
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:47,942
Yeah?

1055
00:57:48,073 --> 00:57:49,640
Police car just pulled up.

1056
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:51,816
Oh, my Lord, that's
Gene, It's Gene.

1057
00:57:51,946 --> 00:57:52,643
Annie, careful.

1058
00:57:55,907 --> 00:57:58,300
Any word from Raylene
yet, Mama Hilburn?

1059
00:57:58,431 --> 00:58:00,607
She'll be here today, I hope.

1060
00:58:00,738 --> 00:58:03,610
She called yesterday fromsomeplace in the desert.

1061
00:58:03,741 --> 00:58:05,743
That's a long
ride with two kids.

1062
00:58:05,873 --> 00:58:07,701
Oh, she wouldn't miss
her little sister's

1063
00:58:07,832 --> 00:58:10,051
wedding for anything.

1064
00:58:10,182 --> 00:58:13,881
You know, Sarah, it's eightyears since I saw here.

1065
00:58:14,012 --> 00:58:16,623
Not your fault.
She's in Mississippi,

1066
00:58:16,754 --> 00:58:17,929
you're in California.

1067
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:22,847
Mama Hilburn.

1068
00:58:22,977 --> 00:58:25,110
Hi, Gene.

1069
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,807
Your bride's in hiding.

1070
00:58:26,938 --> 00:58:28,809
Well, she better
come out tomorrow.

1071
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,289
Yeah.

1072
00:58:30,419 --> 00:58:31,246
Gene.

1073
00:58:31,377 --> 00:58:32,204
Mama, Gene.

1074
00:58:32,334 --> 00:58:33,684
Yes, it's Gene.

1075
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:37,296
Brenda Kay, I've
brought you a present.

1076
00:58:37,426 --> 00:58:38,732
[music playing]

1077
00:58:44,477 --> 00:58:45,217
Careful.

1078
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:51,005
Oh, my.

1079
00:58:51,136 --> 00:58:53,921
Brenda Kay's got her veryown transistor radio.

1080
00:58:54,052 --> 00:58:56,010
Take cover.

1081
00:58:56,141 --> 00:58:59,405
You hold it that close, youwant to turn it down like this.

1082
00:59:04,845 --> 00:59:06,412
Gene, now look
what you've done.

1083
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:11,286
That's beautiful.

1084
00:59:31,393 --> 00:59:32,177
Raylene?

1085
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:39,401
Oh, gosh, honey.

1086
00:59:39,532 --> 00:59:40,315
Mama.

1087
00:59:43,449 --> 00:59:44,929
I want to see
my grandchildren.

1088
00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:47,366
Oh, yeah, OK.

1089
00:59:47,496 --> 00:59:49,542
You two, come on out now.

1090
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:50,456
Come on.

1091
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,284
Come on.

1092
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:56,070
OK, Matthew, I want you to goover to your Grandma Hilburn,

1093
00:59:56,201 --> 00:59:58,116
and I want you to give
her a big hug, OK?

1094
00:59:58,246 --> 00:59:59,117
You do that.

1095
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:02,033
Go on now.

1096
01:00:02,163 --> 01:00:04,949
Matthew, I'm your
grandma, and I want you

1097
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:06,515
to know I love you very much.

1098
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:07,429
Come meet your grandma.

1099
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,779
Uh-uhn.

1100
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:10,432
- Elaine, please don't--
- I don't want to.

1101
01:00:10,563 --> 01:00:11,651
Do this to Mama today, OK?

1102
01:00:11,782 --> 01:00:13,044
You got your pretty dress on.

1103
01:00:13,174 --> 01:00:14,262
No.

1104
01:00:14,393 --> 01:00:15,437
Elaine, do not
pitch a fit today.

1105
01:00:15,568 --> 01:00:16,700
Raylene, you OK?

1106
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:17,614
I'm fine, Mama.

1107
01:00:17,744 --> 01:00:19,267
Elaine, come on.

1108
01:00:19,398 --> 01:00:21,966
Elaine, you get out of thiscar right now, young lady.

1109
01:00:22,096 --> 01:00:23,794
I have told you not to
pitch a fit like this.

1110
01:00:23,924 --> 01:00:25,230
I can't believe you're
doing it right now.

1111
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,493
This is a fine way
to meet your grandma.

1112
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,407
It's OK.

1113
01:00:28,537 --> 01:00:30,278
Can I have a hug?

1114
01:00:30,409 --> 01:00:32,063
Pretty girl.

1115
01:00:32,193 --> 01:00:33,978
We'd have been here sooner,if it weren't for the traffic.

1116
01:00:34,108 --> 01:00:36,502
And we had to stop toput on our Sunday clothes.

1117
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,069
Now, don't start
with me, Matthew.

1118
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:39,374
Just you don't.

1119
01:00:39,505 --> 01:00:40,854
ELAINE: We can do
whatever we want.

1120
01:00:40,985 --> 01:00:42,203
Papa told us so.

1121
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:43,422
Don't.

1122
01:00:43,552 --> 01:00:45,859
Just don't.
- They're divorced.

1123
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:50,995
What?

1124
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:52,692
Oh, Mama.

1125
01:00:52,823 --> 01:00:54,085
It's two years.

1126
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:56,740
Honey, why didn't you tell me?

1127
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:58,698
Because I couldn't
tell you, Mama.

1128
01:00:58,829 --> 01:00:59,830
Honey, I'm sorry.

1129
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,745
I'm sorry.

1130
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:03,268
Listen, everything's
going to be all

1131
01:01:03,398 --> 01:01:06,575
right, because you're home now.

1132
01:01:06,706 --> 01:01:07,707
Don't you worry none.

1133
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:08,621
OK?

1134
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:09,578
Come on.

1135
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:11,406
Go say hello to everyone.

1136
01:01:11,537 --> 01:01:12,407
Annie.

1137
01:01:12,538 --> 01:01:15,019
Oh, my gosh, Annie.

1138
01:01:15,149 --> 01:01:16,847
This is your Uncle Wilman.

1139
01:01:16,977 --> 01:01:18,457
Hey, big fella,
what's your name?

1140
01:01:18,587 --> 01:01:19,414
He's Matthew and I'm Elaine.

1141
01:01:19,545 --> 01:01:20,285
Here they all come.

1142
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:23,114
You ready?

1143
01:01:23,244 --> 01:01:24,724
You know Annie.

1144
01:01:24,855 --> 01:01:26,683
Hello, again.

1145
01:01:26,813 --> 01:01:28,902
- Raylene, Mama.
- I know.

1146
01:01:29,033 --> 01:01:30,077
She came to see us.

1147
01:01:30,208 --> 01:01:32,384
Doesn't she looked beautiful?

1148
01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:37,694
This is your Aunt Brenda Kay,and this is Matthew and Elaine.

1149
01:01:37,824 --> 01:01:39,043
Can you say hello, Brenda Kay?

1150
01:01:39,173 --> 01:01:39,957
Hello.

1151
01:01:43,351 --> 01:01:45,789
Bath, Mama, bye.

1152
01:01:45,919 --> 01:01:49,662
Oh, yes, it's
time for your bath.

1153
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:51,055
We'll come back later
for goodnight hugs.

1154
01:01:51,185 --> 01:01:51,969
Come on, honey.

1155
01:01:52,099 --> 01:01:53,013
Raylene, Mama.

1156
01:01:53,144 --> 01:01:54,406
Raylene.
- I know.

1157
01:01:54,536 --> 01:01:55,842
I know.

1158
01:01:55,973 --> 01:01:57,104
Raylene's going to be
here in the morning.

1159
01:01:57,235 --> 01:01:58,366
They're all going to be here.

1160
01:01:58,497 --> 01:02:00,499
We'll come back
later, and say hello.

1161
01:02:00,629 --> 01:02:02,022
Give everybody hugs.

1162
01:02:02,153 --> 01:02:03,241
Come on, we have to take a back.

1163
01:02:03,371 --> 01:02:04,111
See you later.

1164
01:02:07,549 --> 01:02:08,855
Remember those
little sandwiches

1165
01:02:08,986 --> 01:02:10,596
Mama used to make on car trips?

1166
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,250
Little tuna sandwiches?

1167
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:15,862
I guess I don't make
good tuna sandwiches.

1168
01:02:15,993 --> 01:02:16,820
[inaudible]

1169
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:17,690
He left you?

1170
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:18,952
He left you?

1171
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:20,954
I told you Gower
Cross was no good.

1172
01:02:21,085 --> 01:02:22,477
I told you that.

1173
01:02:22,608 --> 01:02:23,391
What are you doing?

1174
01:02:23,522 --> 01:02:25,132
I told you so?

1175
01:02:25,263 --> 01:02:26,873
I told you so?

1176
01:02:27,004 --> 01:02:28,832
Good news travels real fastin this place, don't it?

1177
01:02:28,962 --> 01:02:30,398
Oh, come on, I'm sorry, Sis.

1178
01:02:30,529 --> 01:02:31,704
I don't mean anything by it.

1179
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:32,705
Yes, you did?

1180
01:02:32,836 --> 01:02:34,011
You meant everything by it.

1181
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:35,708
Just because I'm not
as perfect as you

1182
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,101
all down here in Californiawith all your fancy things.

1183
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:39,799
Please, stop, I
didn't mean that.

1184
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:40,931
I did not mean that?
- All right.

1185
01:02:41,061 --> 01:02:42,497
Sis.

1186
01:02:42,628 --> 01:02:44,412
Burton, do you have abrain in that head of yours?

1187
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:45,370
Oh, come on.

1188
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,285
Annie.

1189
01:02:47,415 --> 01:02:48,721
Sh.

1190
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:50,984
Uh-uh.

1191
01:02:51,115 --> 01:02:54,683
Where'd you learn to do that?

1192
01:02:54,814 --> 01:02:55,684
Hm?

1193
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:58,600
Sh.

1194
01:02:58,731 --> 01:03:00,124
Who taught you that?

1195
01:03:00,254 --> 01:03:01,038
Dennis.

1196
01:03:04,693 --> 01:03:05,433
Dennis?

1197
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:11,962
Mama, you better get out here.

1198
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:13,006
Raylene's crying fit to burst.

1199
01:03:13,137 --> 01:03:14,355
In a minute.

1200
01:03:14,486 --> 01:03:16,183
Mama, all hell's
breaking loose out here.

1201
01:03:16,314 --> 01:03:18,185
Well, crying's good for you.

1202
01:03:18,316 --> 01:03:22,102
I'll come out when I finishgiving Brenda Kay her bath.

1203
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:22,973
Go on.

1204
01:03:31,024 --> 01:03:32,156
Here they are.

1205
01:03:32,286 --> 01:03:33,635
[cheering]

1206
01:03:41,643 --> 01:03:42,514
Sweetheart.

1207
01:03:42,644 --> 01:03:43,471
Hello, Daddy.

1208
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:47,432
Mama.

1209
01:03:47,562 --> 01:03:49,434
Thank you.

1210
01:03:49,564 --> 01:03:53,742
Oh, Mama, thank you.

1211
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:54,613
Take care.

1212
01:03:54,743 --> 01:03:56,441
We will.

1213
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:58,225
You drive safely.

1214
01:03:58,356 --> 01:03:59,574
We will.

1215
01:03:59,705 --> 01:04:00,445
Bye.

1216
01:04:03,535 --> 01:04:06,320
Annie's married
now, Brenda Kay.

1217
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:11,151
She and Gene are going to goand live in their own house now.

1218
01:04:11,282 --> 01:04:13,153
Bye.

1219
01:04:13,284 --> 01:04:14,067
Let's go and eat some cake.

1220
01:04:14,198 --> 01:04:14,938
OK.

1221
01:04:18,463 --> 01:04:21,074
RAYLENE: I hope Annie's donebetter than I did, Mama.

1222
01:04:21,205 --> 01:04:22,771
I wish you'd have
told me and your father.

1223
01:04:22,902 --> 01:04:25,557
Going through such
misery all on your own?

1224
01:04:25,687 --> 01:04:27,559
You got problems enough.

1225
01:04:27,689 --> 01:04:28,908
I couldn't give you mine.

1226
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:33,347
Raylene, I'm your mother.

1227
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:35,959
You You couldn't
change things, Mama.

1228
01:04:36,089 --> 01:04:37,569
I tried to make
it work for years,

1229
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:41,878
but we fought from
the beginning.

1230
01:04:42,008 --> 01:04:45,142
He was always on the road,seeing old girlfriends,

1231
01:04:45,272 --> 01:04:47,448
drinking heavy when he was home.

1232
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:50,408
Honey, I wish I'd
been there for you.

1233
01:04:50,538 --> 01:04:54,107
In the end, we had one realbig fight and he walked out.

1234
01:04:54,238 --> 01:04:54,934
Baby.

1235
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:01,375
Mama, I thought thatmaybe we'd move out here.

1236
01:05:01,506 --> 01:05:03,421
Yes?

1237
01:05:03,551 --> 01:05:05,031
And stay with us?
We'll make room.

1238
01:05:05,162 --> 01:05:05,902
Yes.

1239
01:05:12,256 --> 01:05:14,736
We can take our time driving.

1240
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:16,956
Stay a month or so.

1241
01:05:17,087 --> 01:05:18,392
Why are we going?

1242
01:05:18,523 --> 01:05:20,351
It's home.

1243
01:05:20,481 --> 01:05:21,787
It used to be.

1244
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,485
Well, according to me,
it'll always be home.

1245
01:05:24,616 --> 01:05:27,358
And I want us to
buy a house there.

1246
01:05:27,488 --> 01:05:28,272
Do you want to live there?

1247
01:05:28,402 --> 01:05:29,142
Uh-huh.

1248
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:32,754
Why?

1249
01:05:35,844 --> 01:05:38,935
You joking on me, Leston.

1250
01:05:39,065 --> 01:05:41,546
Listen, honey, we ain't
getting any younger.

1251
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:43,069
Annie is married now.

1252
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,030
We've got no responsibilitiesexcept Brenda Kay.

1253
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,293
I want to go back there.

1254
01:05:49,423 --> 01:05:53,993
I want to end my day sitting ona porch, fishing in the river.

1255
01:05:54,124 --> 01:05:56,691
We can't just takeBrenda Kay out of school.

1256
01:05:56,822 --> 01:05:59,303
Well, you're the one that
teaches her her letters.

1257
01:05:59,433 --> 01:06:00,782
You can do that anywhere.

1258
01:06:00,913 --> 01:06:02,654
Besides she's almost
finished at school.

1259
01:06:02,784 --> 01:06:04,482
Raylene's gonna move here.

1260
01:06:04,612 --> 01:06:06,875
Maybe she'll change her mind?

1261
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:12,098
Look, I got a local paperwith the real estate ads.

1262
01:06:12,229 --> 01:06:14,100
We could live in a palacedown with what we're going

1263
01:06:14,231 --> 01:06:15,667
to make out with this house.

1264
01:06:15,797 --> 01:06:16,581
I've marked some.

1265
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:17,451
Here, take a look.

1266
01:06:20,237 --> 01:06:23,109
You sure got a nervemaking plans for our family.

1267
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:26,417
Who do you think you are?

1268
01:06:26,547 --> 01:06:30,464
I'm the one who's raised BrendaKay every day of her life.

1269
01:06:30,595 --> 01:06:33,990
I'm the one who works at aschool for retarded children.

1270
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,209
I'm not retiring.

1271
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:38,777
You talking to me
of nerve, Miss Jewel?

1272
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:41,562
Selling off our
house bit by bit.

1273
01:06:41,693 --> 01:06:46,741
Selling a clock off a wall withno one's blessing but your own?

1274
01:06:46,872 --> 01:06:50,832
Now, I have been here
10 years for you.

1275
01:06:50,963 --> 01:06:53,270
You railroaded me
into this place,

1276
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,099
and I've stayed 10 years.

1277
01:06:56,229 --> 01:06:58,840
Well, I've had enough.

1278
01:06:58,971 --> 01:07:00,059
And that was our bargain.

1279
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:00,973
Remember?

1280
01:07:06,979 --> 01:07:08,285
You are still my wife.

1281
01:07:15,901 --> 01:07:16,684
OK.

1282
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:24,823
Mama, I hate this.

1283
01:07:24,953 --> 01:07:27,217
I've been back for half a dayand already you're leaving.

1284
01:07:27,347 --> 01:07:28,957
It's only for a month, honey.

1285
01:07:29,088 --> 01:07:31,612
Well, it's not safe out therewith all the stuff going on.

1286
01:07:31,743 --> 01:07:35,399
The freedom marches, bus rides,the Klan's stirring things up.

1287
01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:38,445
Oh, that's not gonna touch us.

1288
01:07:38,576 --> 01:07:41,144
We're just poor crackers
looking for a bayou.

1289
01:07:41,274 --> 01:07:42,319
Here's a nectarine.

1290
01:07:42,449 --> 01:07:43,537
Bye, Mama.
Daddy.

1291
01:07:43,668 --> 01:07:44,495
Bye.

1292
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:45,887
Bye bye.

1293
01:07:46,018 --> 01:07:47,585
Bye.

1294
01:07:47,715 --> 01:07:49,848
Raylene and the kids willhave the house to themselves.

1295
01:07:49,978 --> 01:07:51,284
I think that's good.

1296
01:07:51,415 --> 01:07:53,460
She's had a rough time.

1297
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:55,767
You keep an eye oneverything for me, Annie.

1298
01:07:55,897 --> 01:07:56,681
I will.

1299
01:07:56,811 --> 01:07:57,682
Y'all be good.

1300
01:07:57,812 --> 01:07:58,857
We will.

1301
01:07:58,987 --> 01:08:01,207
Use this napkin, Brenda Kay.

1302
01:08:01,338 --> 01:08:02,513
Mama, Brenda Kay is fine.

1303
01:08:02,643 --> 01:08:04,297
Right now, it's me
you're talking to.

1304
01:08:04,428 --> 01:08:05,777
I know that, honey.

1305
01:08:05,907 --> 01:08:07,996
To the backwoods ofMississippi, Fanny Annie.

1306
01:08:08,127 --> 01:08:11,261
Just as long as
you come back now.

1307
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,392
- You be good.
- We will.

1308
01:08:12,523 --> 01:08:13,306
Bye.

1309
01:08:57,916 --> 01:09:01,311
Oh, it looks like the wholething's about to fall down.

1310
01:09:01,441 --> 01:09:03,008
Uh-huh I guess nobody's
lived here for a while.

1311
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:06,054
I wonder if the old
man still owns it?

1312
01:09:06,185 --> 01:09:09,275
I'm gonna have a
look at the old barn.

1313
01:09:09,406 --> 01:09:12,583
Brenda Kay, wanna come have alook at the old barn with me?

1314
01:09:15,716 --> 01:09:16,630
Come on.

1315
01:09:16,761 --> 01:09:18,066
Do what your daddy says.

1316
01:09:55,756 --> 01:09:57,367
Oh, it's nice to
see you, Nelson.

1317
01:09:57,497 --> 01:09:59,456
Miss Jewel.

1318
01:09:59,586 --> 01:10:00,587
Mr. Hilburn.

1319
01:10:00,718 --> 01:10:04,069
How are you, Nelson?

1320
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,723
No complaints.

1321
01:10:05,853 --> 01:10:07,028
Just growing older
than the Lord.

1322
01:10:07,159 --> 01:10:08,291
How you doing yourselves?

1323
01:10:08,421 --> 01:10:09,379
Just fine.

1324
01:10:09,509 --> 01:10:11,555
We just visiting
some old haunts.

1325
01:10:11,685 --> 01:10:14,384
You bring along your beautifuldaughter, Mrs. Brenda Kay?

1326
01:10:14,514 --> 01:10:15,907
She's asleep in the car.

1327
01:10:18,953 --> 01:10:20,128
Bless her heart.

1328
01:10:33,533 --> 01:10:35,666
You come here
looking for comfort.

1329
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:36,623
Go home.

1330
01:10:36,754 --> 01:10:37,711
Cathedral.

1331
01:10:37,842 --> 01:10:38,886
We ain't got no comfort here.

1332
01:10:46,503 --> 01:10:47,330
Brenda Kay.

1333
01:11:14,879 --> 01:11:18,230
Cathedral?

1334
01:11:18,361 --> 01:11:20,232
Cathedral?

1335
01:11:20,363 --> 01:11:21,233
Brenda Kay.

1336
01:11:23,931 --> 01:11:24,671
Oh.

1337
01:11:42,167 --> 01:11:43,124
Brenda Kay, Brenda
Kay, come here.

1338
01:11:43,255 --> 01:11:44,604
Say hello to Nelson.

1339
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:50,697
You remember Nelson.

1340
01:11:50,828 --> 01:11:51,568
Hi.

1341
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:06,844
We lost our boy, Miss Jewel.

1342
01:12:10,935 --> 01:12:18,551
Dead a year and five
months gone now.

1343
01:12:18,682 --> 01:12:19,900
Killed in a ditch.

1344
01:12:22,773 --> 01:12:28,126
Teaching people how to read ina place where nobody wasn't.

1345
01:12:34,567 --> 01:12:36,264
You taught me how to read.

1346
01:12:39,267 --> 01:12:40,791
And I taught him.

1347
01:12:44,142 --> 01:12:46,013
I'm so very sorry, Cathedral.

1348
01:12:48,755 --> 01:12:51,932
All these years, I'vebeen planning to slap you

1349
01:12:52,063 --> 01:12:53,934
back, but this hand of mine--

1350
01:12:58,939 --> 01:13:03,030
you got all your
children, Miss Jewel.

1351
01:13:03,161 --> 01:13:04,467
All of them.

1352
01:13:04,597 --> 01:13:07,818
They all alive.

1353
01:13:07,948 --> 01:13:12,692
Even that-- that baby girlwhat brought you such hardships

1354
01:13:12,823 --> 01:13:16,783
and tests in this world.

1355
01:13:16,914 --> 01:13:17,784
She's alive.

1356
01:13:17,915 --> 01:13:18,698
Yes.

1357
01:13:21,832 --> 01:13:24,661
But I don't know if
I'll ever get the chance

1358
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:26,184
to teach her to read.

1359
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:32,146
Please, forgive me, Cathedral.

1360
01:13:32,277 --> 01:13:33,017
Please?

1361
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:37,891
Wish me well.

1362
01:13:38,022 --> 01:13:38,762
Please?

1363
01:13:47,945 --> 01:13:52,079
The Lord wishes, wishes
us all well, Miss Jewel.

1364
01:13:55,648 --> 01:13:56,475
He does.

1365
01:14:05,049 --> 01:14:07,312
JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: What wasgoing to happen to my baby here

1366
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,053
In Mississippi?

1367
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:10,750
However hard she
tried, she couldn't

1368
01:14:10,881 --> 01:14:13,187
do a thing for herself.

1369
01:14:13,318 --> 01:14:16,713
Leston had this dream ofspending his days fishing,

1370
01:14:16,843 --> 01:14:19,629
relaxing back in our
old home, but that

1371
01:14:19,759 --> 01:14:21,544
wasn't any good for her.

1372
01:14:21,674 --> 01:14:22,501
And not for us either.

1373
01:14:39,387 --> 01:14:40,258
She's asleep.

1374
01:14:44,392 --> 01:14:47,047
I've changed my mind
about moving back here.

1375
01:14:47,178 --> 01:14:49,267
Leston?

1376
01:14:49,397 --> 01:14:51,791
But if we stay inCalifornia, there is something

1377
01:14:51,922 --> 01:14:54,359
we got to think about.

1378
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,839
What is that?

1379
01:14:55,969 --> 01:14:59,103
Well, we gotta thinkabout Brenda Kay's future.

1380
01:14:59,233 --> 01:15:02,976
She's been relying
on you so much.

1381
01:15:03,107 --> 01:15:06,502
What's going to
happen if we die?

1382
01:15:06,632 --> 01:15:10,201
Well, the children
will look after her.

1383
01:15:10,331 --> 01:15:11,942
Is that what you want?

1384
01:15:12,072 --> 01:15:13,683
You want them looking
after her when

1385
01:15:13,813 --> 01:15:16,207
she's 20, 30, 40, and stillwith the mind of a six-year-old?

1386
01:15:16,337 --> 01:15:18,296
What is it you want then?

1387
01:15:18,426 --> 01:15:20,211
You want to just shut her away?

1388
01:15:20,341 --> 01:15:21,778
Do what the doctor said?

1389
01:15:21,908 --> 01:15:23,910
She's a Mongolian idiot,put her in an institution.

1390
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:25,042
Is that what you want then?

1391
01:15:25,172 --> 01:15:26,826
Cool down.

1392
01:15:26,957 --> 01:15:31,309
I just want you to thinkabout it, talk to Mr. White.

1393
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:34,268
Brenda Kay, she's like a
bird with a broken wing,

1394
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:36,836
and you've been caring
for her so long,

1395
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:38,882
you haven't thought
that maybe she can fly.

1396
01:15:39,012 --> 01:15:40,274
[phone ringing]

1397
01:15:46,106 --> 01:15:47,934
Hello?

1398
01:15:48,065 --> 01:15:50,067
Annie, what are you
doing calling us here?

1399
01:15:50,197 --> 01:15:50,937
What's the matter?

1400
01:15:51,068 --> 01:15:51,851
Who is it?

1401
01:15:51,982 --> 01:15:54,332
It's Annie.

1402
01:15:54,462 --> 01:15:55,942
What?

1403
01:15:56,073 --> 01:15:58,641
She-- what?

1404
01:15:58,771 --> 01:16:00,207
Oh my Lord.

1405
01:16:00,338 --> 01:16:02,732
Raylene.

1406
01:16:02,862 --> 01:16:05,473
OK, we're going to leave
here as fast as we can,

1407
01:16:05,604 --> 01:16:10,478
and you just watch over her, OK?

1408
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:11,392
All right, I love you.

1409
01:16:11,523 --> 01:16:12,306
Bye.

1410
01:16:16,789 --> 01:16:18,574
What's wrong?

1411
01:16:18,704 --> 01:16:21,315
Rayl-- Raylene
tried to kill herself.

1412
01:16:21,446 --> 01:16:23,666
- What?
- Oh my Lord.

1413
01:16:28,235 --> 01:16:29,585
You go help Elaine.

1414
01:16:29,715 --> 01:16:32,065
Raylene must have
been in such despair.

1415
01:16:32,196 --> 01:16:34,459
She swallowed a bottle of pills.

1416
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,331
They found her in
time, thank God.

1417
01:16:37,462 --> 01:16:40,073
Gradually, we got her
back to normal life.

1418
01:16:40,204 --> 01:16:42,336
She had a lot of courage.

1419
01:16:42,467 --> 01:16:44,034
I'm so sorry, Mama.

1420
01:16:44,164 --> 01:16:45,296
Oh, no, honey.

1421
01:16:45,426 --> 01:16:47,124
They're fine.

1422
01:16:47,254 --> 01:16:49,126
Thanks to you and everybody.

1423
01:16:49,256 --> 01:16:53,521
Well, that's what
families are for.

1424
01:16:53,652 --> 01:16:56,089
You seeing Dr. Lafferty today?

1425
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:58,875
Straight after work,
and then I've got class

1426
01:16:59,005 --> 01:17:00,877
tonight, right after college.

1427
01:17:01,007 --> 01:17:03,270
Honey, I hope you're
not doing too much.

1428
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:04,358
Oh, no, Mama.

1429
01:17:04,489 --> 01:17:05,533
I'm doing great.

1430
01:17:05,664 --> 01:17:06,404
Really truly.

1431
01:17:06,534 --> 01:17:07,405
Raylene!

1432
01:17:07,535 --> 01:17:09,146
Hey, Raylene, get over here.

1433
01:17:09,276 --> 01:17:10,060
Well, go on.

1434
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,017
OK.

1435
01:17:11,148 --> 01:17:12,149
I love you.

1436
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:13,019
I love you.

1437
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:13,933
Raylene.

1438
01:17:14,064 --> 01:17:16,022
Raylene.

1439
01:17:16,153 --> 01:17:17,154
She'll be back.

1440
01:17:22,289 --> 01:17:23,421
Listen, Mama.

1441
01:17:23,551 --> 01:17:25,815
Honey, it's a
little bit too loud.

1442
01:17:25,945 --> 01:17:28,295
Let me fix it.

1443
01:17:28,426 --> 01:17:29,209
There.

1444
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:30,080
That's better.

1445
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,041
School today, Mama?

1446
01:17:35,172 --> 01:17:39,089
No, honey, remember, Itold you we don't go anymore.

1447
01:17:39,219 --> 01:17:40,177
You're too old.

1448
01:17:40,307 --> 01:17:41,308
We'll just go to visit.

1449
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,269
You have trouble figuringthat out, don't you?

1450
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:49,882
Sweet girl.

1451
01:17:50,013 --> 01:17:53,190
Hey, Mama, we're going
to play some Frisbee.

1452
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,582
Oh, no.

1453
01:17:54,713 --> 01:17:56,019
Brenda Kay doesn't
like Frisbee, honey.

1454
01:17:56,149 --> 01:17:56,933
What about you, Mama?

1455
01:17:57,063 --> 01:17:57,847
Come on.

1456
01:17:57,977 --> 01:17:59,196
It'll be fun.

1457
01:17:59,326 --> 01:18:00,632
No.

1458
01:18:00,763 --> 01:18:01,938
I'm gonna stay here
with Brenda Kay.

1459
01:18:02,068 --> 01:18:04,723
Oh, Mama.

1460
01:18:04,854 --> 01:18:05,637
You go on.

1461
01:18:05,768 --> 01:18:07,117
Have fun.

1462
01:18:07,247 --> 01:18:10,598
Well, suit YourselfOK, who's gonna catch it?

1463
01:18:14,646 --> 01:18:19,782
It starts just like a B,but it goes straight down.

1464
01:18:19,912 --> 01:18:23,873
It's an R. Second letterin your name, Brenda Kay.

1465
01:18:24,003 --> 01:18:25,396
So you can write your name.

1466
01:18:25,526 --> 01:18:27,006
OK, let's try one.

1467
01:18:27,137 --> 01:18:28,704
You try this one.

1468
01:18:28,834 --> 01:18:35,188
Just let it start like couldB. Round then straight down.

1469
01:18:35,319 --> 01:18:36,537
No, Mama.
No.

1470
01:18:36,668 --> 01:18:37,625
Yes, you almost had it.

1471
01:18:37,756 --> 01:18:38,931
- No.
- OK.

1472
01:18:39,062 --> 01:18:39,802
OK.

1473
01:18:39,932 --> 01:18:42,108
Let's just forget it.

1474
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:43,806
Hey, y'all.

1475
01:18:43,936 --> 01:18:46,243
We brought supper, and Geneand Burton are on their way

1476
01:18:46,373 --> 01:18:48,027
up from work.

1477
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:51,335
Annie made a huge lasagna,and there is salad and brownies.

1478
01:18:53,032 --> 01:18:54,381
I promised Brenda Kayfried chicken for supper.

1479
01:18:54,512 --> 01:18:55,818
Well, that's no problem.

1480
01:18:55,948 --> 01:18:58,646
We'll just fox her up
some fried chicken then.

1481
01:18:58,777 --> 01:18:59,865
Honey, you just
stay here and color.

1482
01:18:59,996 --> 01:19:00,779
I'll be right back.

1483
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:01,780
Mama, please.

1484
01:19:01,911 --> 01:19:02,694
Cold.

1485
01:19:02,825 --> 01:19:04,130
Cold.

1486
01:19:04,261 --> 01:19:05,349
OK, your sweater is on
the back of your chair.

1487
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:06,306
Mama, can you
just make sure Julie

1488
01:19:06,437 --> 01:19:07,307
doesn't eat those crayons?

1489
01:19:07,438 --> 01:19:08,178
She's taken to that lately.

1490
01:19:08,308 --> 01:19:09,135
Cold.

1491
01:19:09,266 --> 01:19:10,876
Just get your sweater.

1492
01:19:11,007 --> 01:19:11,747
Here.

1493
01:19:14,837 --> 01:19:18,449
Mama, she can do that herself.

1494
01:19:18,579 --> 01:19:20,712
Can't you even look afterthe kids for two minutes

1495
01:19:20,843 --> 01:19:22,235
without tending to Brenda Kay?

1496
01:19:22,366 --> 01:19:23,149
She was cold.

1497
01:19:28,894 --> 01:19:32,985
You know, all of ourlives, it's been like this.

1498
01:19:33,116 --> 01:19:36,119
Ever since she was born,you've had no time for us,

1499
01:19:36,249 --> 01:19:37,555
no time for Daddy.

1500
01:19:37,685 --> 01:19:39,731
You've just been set on
doing every little thing

1501
01:19:39,862 --> 01:19:40,688
for Brenda Kay.

1502
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:42,952
She always comes first.

1503
01:19:43,082 --> 01:19:45,781
It has always been, children,if we just love her enough,

1504
01:19:45,911 --> 01:19:46,912
we can fix everything.

1505
01:19:47,043 --> 01:19:47,826
And that's true.

1506
01:19:47,957 --> 01:19:49,915
No, it's not.

1507
01:19:50,046 --> 01:19:51,961
You can never fix
Brenda Kay, Mama.

1508
01:19:52,091 --> 01:19:53,310
She isn't fixable.

1509
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,703
I can't believe you're
talking like this.

1510
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:58,358
You were a much kinderperson when you were little.

1511
01:19:58,489 --> 01:20:00,578
When you gave your
beloved blanket.

1512
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:04,016
Mama, we all love Brenda Kay.

1513
01:20:04,147 --> 01:20:09,108
We love her dearly, but we loveour mom too, and we need her.

1514
01:20:09,239 --> 01:20:10,806
We need you.

1515
01:20:10,936 --> 01:20:13,156
Not as much as
Brenda Kay does.

1516
01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:15,027
No?

1517
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:18,814
What about Raylene and her kids?

1518
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:21,033
Brenda Kay will never
be in that dark pit

1519
01:20:21,164 --> 01:20:23,383
that Raylene's been in.

1520
01:20:23,514 --> 01:20:26,952
Brenda Kay is my baby.

1521
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:28,345
Look at her.

1522
01:20:28,475 --> 01:20:30,869
She always will be.

1523
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,918
No, Mama, she's not your baby.

1524
01:20:36,048 --> 01:20:39,704
Brenda Kay is your 16-year-oldDown syndrome daughter,

1525
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,706
and she needs a life of her own.

1526
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,360
Don't.

1527
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:45,492
Don't you ever, ever--

1528
01:20:50,149 --> 01:20:50,889
What's going on?

1529
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:51,803
Nothing.

1530
01:20:56,025 --> 01:20:56,852
Oh, damn it.

1531
01:21:03,815 --> 01:21:06,600
LESTON: Jewel?

1532
01:21:06,731 --> 01:21:08,602
Jewel?

1533
01:21:08,733 --> 01:21:10,648
Jewel?
It's all right.

1534
01:21:10,778 --> 01:21:12,345
It's all right.
It's all right.

1535
01:21:12,476 --> 01:21:13,694
It's true.

1536
01:21:13,825 --> 01:21:15,609
Everything she said is true.

1537
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:16,523
Jewel.

1538
01:21:19,918 --> 01:21:20,919
Sweetheart, there
now. there now.

1539
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:21,789
There now.

1540
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,052
BRENDA KAY: Mama?

1541
01:21:23,182 --> 01:21:24,749
Listen to Brenda Kay.

1542
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,665
Listen to her.

1543
01:21:27,795 --> 01:21:31,016
She knows I'll come running.

1544
01:21:31,147 --> 01:21:31,974
BRENDA KAY: Mama?

1545
01:21:32,104 --> 01:21:35,281
I always have.

1546
01:21:35,412 --> 01:21:39,155
But I don't have to,
because she's safe,

1547
01:21:39,285 --> 01:21:44,073
and she has people
all around her.

1548
01:21:44,203 --> 01:21:46,989
It doesn't have to be me.

1549
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:48,251
- That's right.
- No.

1550
01:21:48,381 --> 01:21:49,208
You're right.

1551
01:21:49,339 --> 01:21:50,601
It doesn't have to be you.

1552
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:51,471
Oh.

1553
01:21:54,997 --> 01:22:00,089
Leston, what have I done
to you all these years?

1554
01:22:00,219 --> 01:22:01,394
Sweetheart.

1555
01:22:01,525 --> 01:22:03,440
I'm sorry.

1556
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:05,790
You ain't done nothing thatdidn't come out of nothing.

1557
01:22:15,017 --> 01:22:18,672
This is So hard.

1558
01:22:18,803 --> 01:22:21,458
Jewel, you know
being a parent is.

1559
01:22:21,588 --> 01:22:26,071
you raise your child as best youcan, and then when he's grown,

1560
01:22:26,202 --> 01:22:31,033
you end up having to
let him or her go.

1561
01:22:31,163 --> 01:22:34,297
That's true, but
I never thought

1562
01:22:34,427 --> 01:22:36,386
like that about Brenda Kay.

1563
01:22:36,516 --> 01:22:40,825
She's different.

1564
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:44,742
I have known so many dedicatedparents like you who spend

1565
01:22:44,872 --> 01:22:48,180
their entire lives lookingafter their Down syndrome child,

1566
01:22:48,311 --> 01:22:51,444
supplying their every
need, but the day always

1567
01:22:51,575 --> 01:22:55,840
comes when the parents arethe too old or too ill,

1568
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,233
and then they
suddenly disappear,

1569
01:22:57,363 --> 01:23:00,279
and the child is devastated.

1570
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:01,280
Defenseless.

1571
01:23:05,458 --> 01:23:08,809
Brenda Kay needs
defenses, Jewel.

1572
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:11,812
And you can give her them.

1573
01:23:11,943 --> 01:23:13,336
By letting her go.

1574
01:23:13,466 --> 01:23:16,774
Think it more as sharing her.

1575
01:23:16,904 --> 01:23:18,776
Letting other people in.

1576
01:23:41,886 --> 01:23:44,715
Nice place.

1577
01:23:44,845 --> 01:23:45,716
Real quiet.

1578
01:23:48,849 --> 01:23:52,244
You can hear the birds.

1579
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:55,247
What do you see, Brenda Kay?

1580
01:23:55,378 --> 01:23:57,293
School.

1581
01:23:57,423 --> 01:23:58,250
No.

1582
01:23:58,381 --> 01:24:00,209
It's a home.

1583
01:24:00,339 --> 01:24:01,688
Let's take a look.

1584
01:24:19,837 --> 01:24:22,187
Did you have a good trip?

1585
01:24:22,318 --> 01:24:23,710
Yes it was a very nice drive.

1586
01:24:23,841 --> 01:24:24,972
Come and meet Nancy.

1587
01:24:25,103 --> 01:24:26,409
She'll be real glad you're here.

1588
01:24:26,539 --> 01:24:28,976
Nan, the Hilburn's are here.

1589
01:24:29,107 --> 01:24:30,326
Oh.

1590
01:24:30,456 --> 01:24:31,240
Welcome.

1591
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:32,545
Welcome, Mrs. Hilburn.

1592
01:24:32,676 --> 01:24:33,503
Hello.

1593
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:34,634
Mr. Hilburn.

1594
01:24:34,765 --> 01:24:37,115
Mrs. Tindle.

1595
01:24:37,246 --> 01:24:38,551
This is Brenda Kay.

1596
01:24:38,682 --> 01:24:39,987
Hello, Brenda Kay Hilburn.

1597
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:45,471
She's shy with strangers.

1598
01:24:45,602 --> 01:24:47,256
I've got lunch coming up.

1599
01:24:47,386 --> 01:24:49,214
Larry, honey, why don't you goround up the rest of the girls.

1600
01:24:49,345 --> 01:24:50,215
Yeah.

1601
01:24:50,346 --> 01:24:53,000
Are you hungry, Brenda Kay?

1602
01:24:53,131 --> 01:24:54,393
Good.

1603
01:24:54,524 --> 01:24:56,134
I have to tell you,
they start calling

1604
01:24:56,265 --> 01:24:59,224
this place home pretty quickly.

1605
01:24:59,355 --> 01:25:02,271
Of course, that justmeans they have two homes.

1606
01:25:02,401 --> 01:25:05,448
Got any fish in
a pond out there?

1607
01:25:05,578 --> 01:25:07,058
It started out
as a wading pool,

1608
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:08,799
but when Larry got
it all finished,

1609
01:25:08,929 --> 01:25:11,802
not one girl would
dare put a toe in it.

1610
01:25:11,932 --> 01:25:16,198
And one of them hollered outfishing, so what could he do?

1611
01:25:16,328 --> 01:25:18,287
He stocked it with
little rainbow trout.

1612
01:25:18,417 --> 01:25:20,245
Do they eat the fish?

1613
01:25:20,376 --> 01:25:21,768
Not a one.

1614
01:25:21,899 --> 01:25:24,380
They just love to standout there with their rods

1615
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:26,295
twice a day.

1616
01:25:26,425 --> 01:25:27,731
We even have a heck
of a job getting

1617
01:25:27,861 --> 01:25:28,688
them to eat fish sticks.

1618
01:25:28,819 --> 01:25:30,864
RACHEL: Fishing.

1619
01:25:30,995 --> 01:25:31,735
They heard you.

1620
01:25:31,865 --> 01:25:34,477
Now, you've done it.

1621
01:25:34,607 --> 01:25:35,739
No fishing yet.

1622
01:25:35,869 --> 01:25:37,741
Line up now.
Come on, girls.

1623
01:25:37,871 --> 01:25:40,700
Thank you for
lunch, Mrs. Tindle.

1624
01:25:40,831 --> 01:25:41,571
You're welcome, Rachel.

1625
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:45,966
Thank you for lunch.

1626
01:25:46,097 --> 01:25:46,880
You're welcome.

1627
01:25:47,011 --> 01:25:49,361
Olivia.

1628
01:25:49,492 --> 01:25:51,189
Thank you, Miss Nancy.

1629
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,930
You're welcome, Sammy.

1630
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,540
I love you, Nancy.

1631
01:25:54,671 --> 01:25:56,455
I love you too, Sammy.

1632
01:25:56,586 --> 01:25:57,326
How.

1633
01:25:58,762 --> 01:25:59,893
How.

1634
01:26:00,024 --> 01:26:00,807
Sammy, go along
with Larry now, OK?

1635
01:26:01,895 --> 01:26:03,419
Thank you for lunch.

1636
01:26:03,549 --> 01:26:05,160
Oh, you're welcome.

1637
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:08,772
And all the rest of us thankyou for lunch too, Nancy.

1638
01:26:08,902 --> 01:26:11,905
Let's go fishing, girls.

1639
01:26:12,036 --> 01:26:14,604
Here we go.

1640
01:26:14,734 --> 01:26:17,433
Brenda Kay?

1641
01:26:17,563 --> 01:26:20,175
She doesn't understand.

1642
01:26:20,305 --> 01:26:21,088
Brenda Kay?

1643
01:26:25,571 --> 01:26:26,398
It's OK.

1644
01:26:33,318 --> 01:26:34,537
Thanks for lunch.

1645
01:26:37,757 --> 01:26:39,063
You're welcome, Brenda Kay.

1646
01:26:52,076 --> 01:26:55,427
She'll be fine, Sugar.

1647
01:26:55,558 --> 01:26:56,341
Just fine.

1648
01:27:04,523 --> 01:27:07,004
JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: There shewas, that baby I'd carried

1649
01:27:07,134 --> 01:27:10,616
her entire life, my hardship.

1650
01:27:10,747 --> 01:27:12,531
My test.

1651
01:27:12,662 --> 01:27:16,535
And the hardest test of
all was to let her go,

1652
01:27:16,666 --> 01:27:21,540
to give her a life of herown, to know she's happy.

1653
01:27:21,671 --> 01:27:24,978
Not just when I'm with
her, but when I'm not.

1654
01:27:25,109 --> 01:27:26,937
She is happy.

1655
01:27:27,067 --> 01:27:28,765
That's her great gift.

1656
01:27:28,895 --> 01:27:32,334
And the gift she gives to theworld, she and all the children

1657
01:27:32,464 --> 01:27:33,291
like her.

1658
01:27:39,079 --> 01:27:39,819
Brenda Kay?

1659
01:27:49,307 --> 01:27:54,356
B, Daddy, look, B. Mama, B.

1660
01:27:54,486 --> 01:27:57,141
That's very good.

1661
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:58,055
Very good.

1662
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,712
We'll see you later.

1663
01:28:02,842 --> 01:28:04,061
I'm going to take this with me.

1664
01:28:10,546 --> 01:28:13,984
Here's someone
that belongs to you.

1665
01:28:14,114 --> 01:28:14,898
Bird.

1666
01:28:15,028 --> 01:28:18,249
Pretty bird.

1667
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:19,163
Pretty bird.

1668
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:25,038
We're going now.

1669
01:28:25,169 --> 01:28:28,999
And you're-- you're
staying here.

1670
01:28:29,129 --> 01:28:29,826
We'll be back on Saturday.

1671
01:28:34,265 --> 01:28:35,092
I love you, baby.

1672
01:28:38,051 --> 01:28:39,879
You be good now.

1673
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:43,013
See the Saturday.

1674
01:28:43,143 --> 01:28:44,971
I love you, Mama.

1675
01:28:45,102 --> 01:28:47,496
You be good.

1676
01:28:47,626 --> 01:28:48,323
Bye bye.

1677
01:28:54,503 --> 01:28:56,766
OK.

1678
01:28:56,896 --> 01:28:59,769
I love you.

1679
01:28:59,899 --> 01:29:00,639
Bye bye.

1680
01:29:05,296 --> 01:29:06,079
Come on, girls.

1681
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:06,950
Want to go to play?

1682
01:29:29,973 --> 01:29:34,281
JEWEL [VOICEOVER]: Brenda KayHilburn, my hardship, my test.

1683
01:29:39,243 --> 01:29:41,767
And the way God
smiled down on me too.

1684
01:29:51,821 --> 01:29:55,346
