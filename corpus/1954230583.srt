1
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,934
My dear, I would like to thank you
for accepting our invitation...

2
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,061
and I would like to
introduce you to the gentleman

3
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,572
who first suggested
your presence here.

4
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,870
Colonel Peter Vojnovic.

5
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,946
Unfortunately, Colonel...

6
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,315
she had an emergency come up,
and she has to leave.

7
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,354
I will remember this night
for a long time.

8
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,325
You may never forget it, Mowgli.

9
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,529
Man: I understand completely,
and I want you to know...

10
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:28,029
the United States government is grateful
for your help, Miss Chernenko.

11
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,634
As soon as I get
my green card.

12
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,279
Very interesting...

13
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,590
Oh, my God, what is this?

14
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,465
Let me go!

15
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,270
There is no...

16
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,219
Goran?
What's going on?

17
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,200
This is unacceptable...

18
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,183
We've changed your hotel
for safety reasons.

19
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,847
The building across
from the Sheraton is empty.

20
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,359
This makes it easier
for us to...

21
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,065
Colonel?

22
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,297
Yaghh!

23
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:14,379
The following is a special report
of the European-American Network.

24
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:18,043
Colonel Vojnovic will be the first
of four high ranking officers...

25
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,917
to be tried on Friday
for crimes against humanity...

26
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:24,116
in the Bosnian war crimes tribunal.

27
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,526
Vojnovic was the leader
of a Serbian military unit...

28
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,688
known as the "Brown Hats. "

29
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,894
This group tops the list
of human rights organizations

30
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,596
as perpetrators of inhuman
acts of attrition...

31
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:41,937
and so-called "ethnic cleansing"
against Croats and Bosnians

32
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,068
during the Bosnian War.

33
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,136
Since the capture
of the Serbian colonel

34
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,705
by American military forces
some three months ago...

35
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,944
numerous bomb threats
have been made

36
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,953
against the UN prison compound
here in The Hague.

37
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:02,323
Man: "High Fences... Firewall.
" I'm not getting in that way.

38
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,489
Can't jump over the fence,
or go around it...

39
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,998
Let's try Mr. Parker's domain.

40
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,933
- Children, none; wife deceased...
- Thirty seconds.

41
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,459
attachés, secretaries,
valets, housekeepers...

42
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,734
subordinates... a driver.

43
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,907
- Pets, cats, dogs...
- Twenty.

44
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,913
a hamster, a horse.

45
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,814
- Horse is a gift from...
- Fifteen seconds.

46
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,341
NSC advisor Jean Parker.

47
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,253
Horse's name: "Goblin".
How sweet.

48
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,619
"Goblin. "

49
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,647
Five seconds.

50
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:33,784
I'm in.

51
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:34,918
You're in?

52
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:40,365
Deep enough to see that NSC advisor
Parker has awarded a certain...

53
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,130
"BB" three stars...?

54
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,028
What time's your plane, Mitchell?

55
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,305
About 35 minutes, General.
My kid's sleeping in the limo now.

56
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,778
- Well, good hunting.
- Thank you.

57
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,804
Oh, by the way, Mitchell...

58
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,841
does Mr. Parker's information reveal
what "BB" does to rate three stars?

59
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,717
She bites.

60
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,157
"She bites. "

61
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,265
I hear the girls in Armenia
are pretty sexy.

62
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,134
You said the same thing
about Poland.

63
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,471
- Who said that? I said that?
- But I've never seen one.

64
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:26,808
All I've seen are those not-so-sexy
secretaries in another ugly embassy.

65
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,838
Well, Bucharest is the last one,
and it's only for three days.

66
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,907
I had better things
to do, Steve.

67
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,010
Wait a minute.
For years, all I hear is...

68
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,918
"We've gotta spend
more time together. "

69
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,923
Now you've got
"better things to do"?

70
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,484
Taking me to work with you
is not what I meant by, "more time".

71
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:47,528
Chris, have you thought more
about what we were talking about?

72
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,558
I know you love your grandma...

73
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,036
I don't want to live
with my grandparents, Steve.

74
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,268
How's that gonna help things
between us?

75
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,204
I wanna live with you.

76
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,269
Look... Chris...

77
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,278
I'm not a very good dad.

78
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,076
And I'm never gonna be
a very good dad.

79
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,020
Period.

80
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:17,027
I'm a cranky, irascible,
impatient, workaholic.

81
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,896
You don't have
very much fun with me.

82
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:23,629
I mean, let's face it.
I don't make you happy.

83
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,229
No, Steve, no.

84
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:30,072
The truth is,
I don't make you happy.

85
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,380
Morning, Sarge.

86
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,619
Hi. Steve Mitchell, Chris Mitchell,
to see Ambassador Gannon, please.

87
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,893
- Welcome to Bucharest, Mr. Mitchell.
- Thank you.

88
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,298
I will let Deputy Tomberlin
know you're here.

89
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,860
- Mr. Mitchell?
- Hi.

90
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,496
I am the ambassador's
governess.

91
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,131
How do you do?

92
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,335
This is his daughter, Gina.

93
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:14,312
Hi, Gina. This is my...
my son, Chris.

94
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,874
We're just about to catch
a bus for the city.

95
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,614
Perhaps Chris...
would you like to come along?

96
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,748
Perhaps Chris would like...
excuse me.

97
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,649
- What?
- I brought stuff to read.

98
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,423
Are you kidding? That girl's
hotter than a pistol.

99
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,727
Plus, it'll keep you out
of another embassy.

100
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,825
- He'd love to come.
- Ah, good.

101
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,101
Has my liason arrived yet?

102
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,471
She's waiting for you
in the old security room.

103
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,344
You'll be meeting
Ambassador Gannon at lunch.

104
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,370
Very good, very good.
Thank you.

105
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,107
Otherwise, your time
is pretty much your own.

106
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,949
Chris...?

107
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,884
Chris?

108
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,326
Chris?

109
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,867
Come on, come on,
let's go.

110
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,506
Thank God they finally
got around to sending you guys...

111
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,066
to update
those computer systems.

112
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,206
Mr. Mitchell?

113
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,675
Steven Mitchell?
This is Erica Long.

114
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,055
I'll be downstairs
if you need anything.

115
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,128
Nice to see you,
"Bubbles".

116
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,736
Of all the computer rooms in all
the embassies in all the world...

117
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:54,542
I gotta stroll into...
I don't believe you.

118
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,844
We were bound to run
into each other sooner or later.

119
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,543
Just the luck of the draw, right?

120
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,110
Did you do Moscow?

121
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,817
Yep.
And Warsaw and East Berlin.

122
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,450
Who was your liason?

123
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,051
You know that's classified.

124
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,662
A woman?

125
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:15,360
You could talk about a miracle,
but never mention the angel.

126
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,131
Yeah, right.
I've done four.

127
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,263
- Really?
- Um-hmm.

128
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,365
Prague was the best.

129
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,735
Budapest wasn't bad, either.

130
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,440
I can't believe we haven't been
together on one of these before.

131
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,745
Erica:
Like they were made for each other.

132
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,954
So what do you say...
we go see the ambassador

133
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,788
for the security access,
and head down to the site?

134
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,319
There's no rush, is there?

135
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,594
That thing's been down there since
the first day of the Cold War.

136
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,631
- How did you do it?
- I got a draw.

137
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,106
Something tells me...

138
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:02,513
that you used some serious grease
to get us here together.

139
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,108
What else is that "something"
telling you?

140
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,423
Erica:
Does this belt really open?

141
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,455
Sergeant:
Excuse me, sir...

142
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,468
Morning, Ms. Long.
You two find everything you need?

143
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,367
So far, so good,
thank you.

144
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,670
Ambassador Gannon's ready for you
when you're finished in here.

145
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,642
Hopefully, before lunch.

146
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,770
Okay. Thank you, Sergeant.

147
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,827
Ma'am, I need you
to step through again, please?

148
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,928
Step back.

149
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,962
The detector's not working.

150
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:17,187
So what else is there
to do in this town?

151
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:20,920
I hear the Russian Circus is in town.

152
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,986
Russian Circus? Okay, that's an idea.
We could do that.

153
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,263
So, how's the wife, Steve-o?

154
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,295
Car accident.

155
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,064
I'm sorry.

156
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,940
Yeah.

157
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,038
Kind of a bad start, huh?

158
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:48,480
At least you got a little of that
domestic life you were looking for.

159
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,546
I never figured you wanted
to go that way, so...

160
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,749
I never heard you ask.

161
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,893
So, what's the security gimmick
down here this time?

162
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,728
A pool full of crocodiles?

163
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,200
The ambassador will let us know.
That's why he's waiting for us.

164
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,430
Well, let's get on the good foot.

165
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,406
Sergeant Nakajima,
this is my liason, Steve Mitchell.

166
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,240
Yeah, hi.
We... met, right?

167
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,042
Good to meet you.

168
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,877
Why don't you stay here...

169
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,077
and the sergeant will show you
how the computer system works.

170
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,052
I'll be back in five minutes.

171
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,576
Right.

172
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:23,747
Well...

173
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,718
nice to see you again.

174
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,664
This place may not look like much
to a world traveler like yourself...

175
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,328
- Doesn't.
- But it used to be security.

176
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,701
"Used to be" is right
It's older than dirt.

177
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,330
I've still got all the surveillance
connections here...

178
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:45,036
so if I wanna take a walk
through the lobby I press a button.

179
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,545
If I wanna take a stroll
through the streets of Bucharest...

180
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,480
I just press this button,
and I'm outside.

181
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,110
- Look, it's a wedding.
- How charming.

182
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,120
Talk about starting off
on the wrong foot.

183
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,020
What's that?
Romanian foreplay?

184
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,025
Actually, they call it, "Prelude".

185
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,493
"Prelude"
Tough.

186
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,818
Down! Move!
You sit!

187
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,989
There's one on the second floor.
West corridor.

188
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,165
And another one in the kitchen.

189
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,741
Sergeant: He's cleaning up
with a thermal tracking device.

190
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,512
They'd have to get a sensor
in here to use that thing.

191
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,419
And on the third floor,
across the stairs, two people.

192
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,446
...across the stairs...
- That's us.

193
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,753
This place was done over
in the 50's, but it works.

194
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,602
Goran? There is nothing
across the stairs.

195
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,585
They've cut communications.

196
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,383
Hell, that's cold.
What are you doing?

197
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,289
Disappearing.

198
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,733
We're about to witness the shortest
hostage crisis in history.

199
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,335
- What are you doing?
- Just keep your eye on the desk.

200
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,102
- The desk is rigged?
- Just watch the desk.

201
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,346
One step closer.
One step... gotcha.

202
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,319
- Uh-uh.
- What?

203
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,821
Zoom in on this other camera.

204
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,620
I seem to recognize
those pretty blonde curls, don't you?

205
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,456
Sir, she's not in the line of fire.

206
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,793
You kill Erica instead of him,
this whole thing gets worse.

207
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,730
How is that possible?

208
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,167
I need to erase some classified
information in the basement...

209
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,227
and I need her to access it.

210
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:49,866
I'm going for that woman before
he picks up the thermo-tracking.

211
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,623
Thank you for coming, gentlemen.
I appreciate your quick response.

212
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,426
- Who's closest to the embassy?
- Buck Swain.

213
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:17,060
He's putting together a combined
special forces unit as we speak.

214
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,935
The elite of the Army, Navy,
Air Force, and Marines.

215
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,132
What I want to know is about
the security breach.

216
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,506
Security? In our embassies?
Tell me another story.

217
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,926
Ambassador...

218
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,891
Ambassador Gannon.

219
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,595
I need the security code.

220
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,739
It's not gonna do
much good in here.

221
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,642
I don't plan on staying.

222
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,883
Six...

223
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,910
G... 3... zero...

224
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,820
Ambassador Gannon?

225
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,525
That man is the American
ambassador to Romania...

226
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,964
And you are?

227
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:27,968
Diplomatic attaché Erica Long.

228
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:35,410
Your name must have more to do
with your legs, Miss Long...

229
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,642
than your life span.

230
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,152
At least I still have
a life span.

231
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:47,417
Oh, boy.
We got a live one, here.

232
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,446
Tim...
I'm at the north corridor.

233
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,142
All right.

234
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,050
Stay to the left and the rear
of the building.

235
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,019
Did you get that?
Sir...?

236
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,160
Step out there, and read this.

237
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,060
Wait.

238
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,336
The whole world
is going to be watching.

239
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,875
Reporter:
Someone has just been pushed out...

240
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,346
It looks like U.S. ambassador
Jacques Gannon.

241
00:24:56,261 --> 00:25:00,425
The Serbian Liberation Front
is holding 37 prisoners of war.

242
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:07,495
Their fate is in the hands
of the United States government...

243
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:11,407
who now must arrange
for the immediate release

244
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,935
of Colonel Peter Vojnovic...

245
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,541
who was criminally abducted
three months ago...

246
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:23,410
from the Russian embassy
by American military forces.

247
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,125
Until that time...

248
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,427
one hostage will be killed
every hour, beginning now.

249
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:38,129
The second is being chosen
as I speak.

250
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,229
The first will be...

251
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,841
Ambassador Gannon.

252
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,868
Me.

253
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,486
He's coming down slowly,
almost at the bottom.

254
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,398
There's a palpable tension
in the air...

255
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,603
as Ambassador Gannon steps away
from his besieged embassy.

256
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,669
Ambassador Jacques Gannon
is approaching the police line.

257
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,704
He's just a few short feet
from safety.

258
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,810
Authorities are whisking him into
a police vehicle under heavy guard.

259
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,614
As you can imagine,
chaos has broken out...

260
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,401
Reporter: The van the ambassador
had entered seconds ago has blown up.

261
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,220
Goddamn it!

262
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,284
How did I know
you'd come for me?

263
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,955
We have some unfinished
business, don't we?

264
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,692
I thought we were pretty much
finished for today.

265
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,394
Enthusiasm is the greatest
aphrodisiac.

266
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,066
Tim, second floor...
good to go.

267
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:55,538
Tim:
Go, go, go!

268
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,938
Tim:
Go, go!

269
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,173
What's telling me Miss Long
was helped out of here...

270
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,238
by the guy that doesn't exist?

271
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:08,142
Go get her.

272
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,485
Okay, we're in the third floor
emergency stairwell. What up?

273
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,587
All right, sir. Stay towards
the rear of the building...

274
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,393
the living areas.
There are no cameras there.

275
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,593
That's not gonna help
with the thermo.

276
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,864
There isn't any
thermo-tracking device.

277
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,079
Yes!

278
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,750
Steve, why are we going up?
Shouldn't we be heading down?

279
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:43,515
Not until we know how to get down
without getting our asses shot.

280
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,523
Listen, if those guys
do know what's down there...

281
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,024
they also know that it's old.

282
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,720
And they're not going to have to
buy much time to get control of that.

283
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,023
Trust me.

284
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,166
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Weren't the 50's fun?

285
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,970
I wouldn't know.
I wasn't born yet.

286
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,385
Gentlemen, I think we should
take advantage of this opportunity

287
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,288
to strike the hard line
against terrorists.

288
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,453
I suggest you let me
bomb the shit out of them.

289
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,328
There are 37 people in there.

290
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,958
Weren't you the one who made all
those speeches after the Iran crisis

291
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,161
about shooting first,
and asking questions later?

292
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,295
He was going through
a divorce at the time.

293
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,570
Sorry...

294
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,633
I suggest you let me
call in an immediate air strike.

295
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:39,734
General Swain's
already halfway there.

296
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,440
We've already decided
on policy...

297
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,612
Gentlemen.
This is more of a...

298
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,082
special situation.

299
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,253
Early in the Cold War, we found out
where to position atomic bombs...

300
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,732
what were determined areas
of primary defense.

301
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:06,863
We decided the best strategy would be
to have these bombs already planted

302
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:10,170
at these targets in the capitals
of these Communist nations.

303
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,836
This way, we would have
first-strike capability...

304
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,277
before the enemy could even
launch their missiles.

305
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,544
A nuclear defense wall,
so to speak.

306
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:23,577
It became obvious where we could
most easily conceal these weapons.

307
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:27,113
In our own embassies.

308
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,228
Who the hell made that decision?

309
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:36,256
Hold on, Ed. How much of this
"nuclear wall" still exists?

310
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,996
Bucharest is the last.

311
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:40,129
And you think it's a coincidence
terrorists have chosen Bucharest?

312
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,765
I might have, if they hadn't
attacked on the day

313
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,071
we sent two operatives
to disarm it and ship it back.

314
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,509
Is there any way we can
shut down the system from here?

315
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:50,275
It's a monitoring system.
It doesn't regulate.

316
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,716
So, it's very likely these terrorists
know something we don't.

317
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:57,278
And it's even more likely
we don't have any way to stop them.

318
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,291
Excuse me,
what are you doing?

319
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,590
I'm calling the President.
I don't think he knows a thing.

320
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,890
I can't permit that.

321
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,988
Why not?

322
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,965
The previous administration
ordered the Joint Chiefs

323
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,025
to keep silent about this
before you were one of them.

324
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,969
- That order's still valid.
- This is insane.

325
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,234
No, this is national security.

326
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,400
Need I remind you,
we have a national security advisor...

327
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,468
who is still responsible
for making a final call on this?

328
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,782
Hang it up, Ben.

329
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:36,890
We are not going to get
down there in the open, baby.

330
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,130
Ventilation shafts.

331
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:43,565
No, there's a pressure sensor
that'll send an alarm to security.

332
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,797
What if we change the pressure?

333
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,363
- CO-2.
- Might work.

334
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,342
This seems like a lot of trouble
to erase some information.

335
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,971
What is it gonna take for you
to tell me what's going on?

336
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,416
I'm still one hostage short.
Did you find that woman?

337
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:03,943
Goran?

338
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,717
There's some commotion outside.

339
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,329
Reporter:
... a 13 or 14-year-old boy...

340
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,265
or should I say, a very brave
young man. I see him now...

341
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,266
As we stand watching,
one of the terrorists

342
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,967
is lifting the boy
from the ledge, onto the roof.

343
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:00,637
This poor boy has spent ten minutes
dangling above the ground.

344
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:09,682
- Okay?
- Yeah.

345
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,681
- Sorry.
- Aghh!

346
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,475
We are not getting paid enough
to be part of this kinda work.

347
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:43,079
Do you have any idea
what we're worth...

348
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:46,056
in the real world,
doing what we do?

349
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,183
It just doesn't feel right.

350
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:51,627
- Feels pretty good from here.
- I'm not kidding.

351
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:54,893
I'm not kidding either,
but you gotta consider the perks.

352
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:58,424
International cuisine,
beautiful hotels, beautiful museums...

353
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,994
interesting people,
exotic places...

354
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,372
Right. Where else would I get to see
the inside of a ventilation shaft?

355
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,707
Maybe we should ask for a raise.

356
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:09,838
Yeah, there you go.

357
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,548
Tim: You guys are in the red.
What's taking so long? Come on.

358
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,459
Come on.

359
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,742
Tim: Pressure's up,
already. Bring it down.

360
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,905
What's going on?

361
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:47,611
Do I look like a fireman?
I don't know what's wrong with it.

362
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,119
Okay, it's not working.
We better get out of here.

363
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:52,213
Faith...
just a little faith.

364
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,624
All right, they know
where you are, get out.

365
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,761
You guys hear me?
Get out.

366
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:29,688
Tim:
Okay, okay, go.

367
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,490
Straight or left?

368
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,020
Take it to the left.

369
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,685
I think I've got
my one o'clock.

370
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,588
EAN TV has just picked up
this live transmission...

371
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,498
said to be coming from within
the United States embassy.

372
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:17,404
I have decided
that this young man...

373
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,602
will be my next message to you.

374
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,214
I will shoot him...

375
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:28,514
unless I am given proof that
Colonel Vojnovic has been released.

376
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,879
In...

377
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,619
nine minutes.

378
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,787
Son of a bitch, he has his own
satellite transmission.

379
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,956
I want nothing that happens
in that embassy on the air.

380
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:44,559
Cut that transmission, scramble it,
and feed it into our system.

381
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:45,899
Goddamn it.

382
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,275
Mitchell:
I'm with ya.

383
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,981
Okay, Tim. We're at a crossroads.
Which way?

384
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,483
Take the right, then call me
at the next intersection.

385
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,509
- Okay.
- Let's go.

386
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,378
- Son of a bitch...
- What?

387
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,324
Son of a bitch,
he's gonna kill some kid.

388
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,850
I didn't see a kid down there.

389
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,795
How old is he?

390
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,491
Tim:
Thirteen, fourteen...

391
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,523
What color jacket
does he have on?

392
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:21,504
Jean jacket,
wearing a walkman...

393
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,530
- It's Chris.
- Chris?

394
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,769
What the hell is he doing there?
I gotta go.

395
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:29,708
Steve, if you don't follow protocol,
I don't have any choice.

396
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,179
You shoot me, you can't do
very much with that bomb, can you?

397
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,449
I can't do anything with it
if you leave me alone here, either.

398
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,184
Goddamn it, Steve!

399
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:43,725
We are here for a bomb
We have to do this.

400
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:47,720
He's my son, Erica.

401
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,131
Help me.

402
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,721
I'm in the john...
on the second floor.

403
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:57,291
Tim: All right, just sit tight.
I'll let you know when you're clear.

404
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,698
Goran:
You have two minutes.

405
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,366
I still don't see the colonel.

406
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:06,865
The clock is still ticking.

407
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:11,075
- We have to do something.
- What the hell can we do?

408
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:14,243
With what he's sitting on?
And a gun pointed at a kid's head?

409
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,779
They still got a gun on my kid?

410
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,190
Yeah.
A minute-thirty.

411
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:25,127
Well, get me there.

412
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,063
Okay, okay, go.
No... no, wait...

413
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,867
I gotta go.

414
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:35,360
Okay, okay, go.
You're clear.

415
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,247
Chris...!

416
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,316
Come on.

417
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:43,704
Pull, pull!

418
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,615
Secure that room!

419
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,421
Where's the kid?

420
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,476
Chris, are you okay?

421
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:30,379
You sick murderer.

422
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:35,820
The lady of the house will be
your next one o'clock.

423
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,725
Goran?

424
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,730
NATO is causing problems
getting the colonel out of prison.

425
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:45,333
They need more time.

426
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,701
Whispering:
Help me, God... please.

427
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,375
I give you another hour.

428
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,236
Son of a...

429
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:05,114
I'd like to recommend
we send for Vojnovic.

430
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:07,783
Only to get Goran
out of the embassy.

431
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,794
You know American foreign policy
on war criminals and terrorists.

432
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,261
How are you going to explain
to the President...

433
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,821
we let Vojnovic out of jail
after just two hours?

434
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,561
The President is not going
to authorize a release...

435
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:21,196
unless we explain why we have to
get that terrorist out of the embassy.

436
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:24,799
We're talking about
an atomic bomb, here.

437
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,969
Then it would seem...

438
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,172
we're going to have to tell him.

439
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:31,271
Before we take one more step...

440
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:37,002
You should know...
I am a Croat.

441
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:09,070
Where the hell is Swain?!

442
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,347
Saddle up.

443
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:06,595
General Swain, I'm Colonel Vasilescu.
Welcome to Romania, sir.

444
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,332
Thank you, Colonel.

445
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,410
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

446
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:21,842
Damn.

447
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,648
They get anything important?

448
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:26,417
No, everything important
was in my throat.

449
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,152
And what are you doing here?

450
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:31,457
You're supposed to be on a bus,
not getting your brains blown out.

451
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:35,795
I put you on a bus, with a cute
fat girl, and what is this?

452
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,562
You don't like embassies,
you don't like my work...

453
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,569
what are you doing here?

454
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:40,968
I missed you...?

455
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,972
Tim:
Looks like we've got activity outside.

456
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:45,474
Reporter:
... they are under the command

457
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,943
of Michael "Buck" Swain...

458
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:52,608
highly decorated field commander who
took part in Operation Desert Storm.

459
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,090
Move out, move out, go!

460
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:36,988
- Captain?
- Sir?

461
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,159
I want Alpha squad right in their face,
Baker at the back door...

462
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,064
Excuse me, General?

463
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,569
We should discuss
whatever movements you're planning.

464
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:48,662
The embassy is
United States territory.

465
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:51,606
On this sidewalk,
you're in Romania, sir.

466
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:58,181
Oh, okay.
Excuse me.

467
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,409
Captain?

468
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,541
Yes, sir?

469
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:02,518
Find me a spot to place
an operations command post.

470
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,043
Right away, sir.

471
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:09,385
And, Colonel...?

472
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:15,365
Since your people seem to have
difficulty dispersing that crowd...

473
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,367
perhaps when the shooting starts...

474
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:21,098
you'll keep them
on your side of the line?

475
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,661
General Swain, here.

476
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,260
Goran:
I was hoping they'd send you, Swain.

477
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,031
All right, who is this?

478
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,298
Your old schoolmate, Buck.

479
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:05,415
Goran Mladinov.

480
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:09,078
I know all the options, Swain.

481
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,953
Nothing you do will work,
unless delivering Colonel Vojnovic.

482
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:19,794
These tunnels lead to a fork,
that means she and I go left.

483
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,627
Where's that other one go?

484
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,156
Looks like that tunnel
opens up to the river.

485
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,795
If you wanna get your kid out
of the embassy, that's the best way.

486
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,930
How do I know these goons
don't know about it?

487
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:31,736
They haven't bothered us in this room,
so they're not working off this map.

488
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,402
They can't know about that tunnel.

489
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:37,277
Take Chris down that tunnel,
and get him out of the city.

490
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:39,111
- Out of the city?
- The city, out of the country...

491
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,674
- off the continent, you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

492
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:44,016
So who is this Mladinov guy?

493
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:48,514
Goran Mladinov? He finished at
the top of his class at Ft. Bragg...

494
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:53,154
then trained by Delta Command
and the CIA...

495
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:56,791
Serbian parents, raised in America,
went back to Serbia to find his roots...

496
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,631
ended up heading what's left
of Vojnovic's Brown Hats.

497
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,662
Do they teach what he knew about
that embassy in Bragg, General?

498
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:05,174
- No.
- Then how did he know about it?

499
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:08,234
Let's see. I've been told
that the metal detectors failed.

500
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,712
Could be a coincidence,
but highly unlikely to me.

501
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:13,614
He could be a clairvoyant,
but that would be a long shot.

502
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,016
I'm no intelligence officer,
but if I had to guess...

503
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:19,318
and I'm guessing now, I'd say
Goran had people on the inside.

504
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:23,520
Which means...
he may know everything you know.

505
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,624
And probably knows more
than I know.

506
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,169
Standard operating procedure
until you hear from me, General.

507
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:39,865
Gentlemen, he's going to kill
everyone before we can get in there.

508
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:43,402
I say we go back to using Vojnovic
and get Goran out of the embassy.

509
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:45,677
Have you been with us
for the last two hours?

510
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,877
I've been in touch with Interpol
and come up with a few options.

511
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:54,817
Actually, a few very close
choices to Vojnovic, all in Europe.

512
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,553
This isn't gonna work!

513
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:59,994
Even if he buys it, it's only
gonna work till they get together.

514
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,123
Right, at the airport,
outside the embassy.

515
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,861
That's all we're trying to do.

516
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:07,301
Go back to the guy before,
number two.

517
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,337
Borghelli.

518
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:18,371
Car thief turned chief.
Doesn't say of what.

519
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:21,646
It says, "chef",
not "chief".

520
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:25,414
Oh... right.

521
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,756
I do what I can.

522
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,954
Giorgio Borghelli?

523
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,947
CIA.

524
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,221
You guys are fast, huh?

525
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,694
Hey, Borghelli!

526
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:29,919
Borghelli:
This Vojnovic guy had taste.

527
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:32,183
- Huh?
- Yeah.

528
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:37,057
You think I make this for you,
I can keep the shoes, no?

529
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:41,363
Cosmetician:
Of course, sure.

530
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,764
Mamma mía...

531
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:49,397
Look at this watch.

532
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,666
An important mission
I'm helping with, no?

533
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:57,078
I don't know why.
I don't even know one American.

534
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,480
Cosmetician:
Is the camera ready?

535
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:04,977
Okay. You're not to do
anything except sit.

536
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:07,546
And try to look like you're thinking
about something important.

537
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,219
But that's difficult, no?

538
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:14,663
I mean, who knows
what could happen to me?

539
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:18,293
I'm sure we could arrange
for you to keep the watch.

540
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:21,002
All right.

541
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:24,803
And, a little trip
to Miami, maybe?

542
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,468
I've never been to America.

543
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,776
A little spending money?
Five, ten thousand?

544
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,651
We'll find somebody else.

545
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,190
Bene.
Take me back... finito.

546
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:43,454
No, you know too much.

547
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,984
What?
Take me back.

548
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:48,930
The camera's not on, is it?

549
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:54,765
I'm sorry you had to be
involved in this.

550
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:09,741
Your "chief" Borghelli
looks a little... chunky.

551
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,852
He's gotten fat.

552
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:21,124
Give him today's paper.

553
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,647
I want to speak to him.

554
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,954
We've got a problem with the sound.
We're gonna work it out.

555
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,794
We have a big problem
with the sound.

556
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,194
We don't have any!

557
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,324
Look, relax.

558
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:57,856
We can do this.

559
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,801
The moment I started looking
for a face...

560
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,929
I knew I needed a voice
I could put with it.

561
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,471
"This little pig went to market...

562
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,909
This little pig went home...

563
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:13,109
this little pig had roast beef,
this little pig had none.

564
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:16,607
This little pig went,
'wee, wee, wee, wee... "'

565
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,143
Excuse me.

566
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:21,954
Go through that "wee-wee-wee"
stuff again, please.

567
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:27,521
"This little pig went,
'wee, wee, wee, wee... "'

568
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:29,758
Hello?

569
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:32,267
- That's it.
- He's on the line... go!

570
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,835
Colonel?

571
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,273
Decoy:
Captain...

572
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:42,403
you have done well.

573
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:46,905
Your courage, and that
of our men, has won the day.

574
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,987
I'm sure our countrymen
will be very happy.

575
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:56,322
Your wife and daughters
will be relieved.

576
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,959
Decoy:
I understand.

577
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:02,931
Goran:
I have arranged for a plane.

578
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,298
We brought our own pilot.

579
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:06,529
Excellent.

580
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:10,365
I guess...

581
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:13,638
One daughter... one daughter.
One...

582
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,872
Yes, you will.

583
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:20,706
Goodbye, sir.

584
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,310
Captain...

585
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:24,752
Yes?

586
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:27,985
Decoy:
How long have I been away?

587
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,287
Three months.

588
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:37,165
How is it possible my wife has had
another daughter in that time?

589
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:42,132
It is not, sir.

590
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:47,701
I understand.
I see you soon.

591
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,177
Nice recovery.

592
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:06,194
This is the fork.
The exit's that way.

593
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,362
Take care of him.

594
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,628
Dad...?

595
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:13,795
What?

596
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,239
When the guy had the gun
in my face...

597
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:22,437
I was thinking.

598
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:26,609
If I had listened to you,
I'd probably be sightseeing right now.

599
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:33,012
Maybe it's not all you...
you know?

600
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,255
Maybe I'm just as bad at being a son,
as you are at being a dad.

601
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:45,263
Take care of him.

602
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:50,462
Let's go, buddy... come on.

603
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:03,677
- Seems like a nice kid.
- He's a great kid; that's my problem.

604
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,017
You'll find a common ground.

605
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:08,490
- We don't have anything in common.
- Where have I heard that one before?

606
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,186
Who said that?
Did I say that?

607
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,524
Maybe you just need to spend
some more time together.

608
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:15,258
That, I've heard before.

609
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:19,057
You know, it's too bad you're not
doing a little better financially.

610
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:22,128
You'd have some more free time
to deal with your life...

611
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,537
"Bubbles".

612
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,145
Okay, Colonel, bring it in.

613
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:48,524
Reporter: The bus you're seeing
will take the hostages to safety.

614
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:52,467
If the rumors are true that
Colonel Vojnovic has been released...

615
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:56,529
it would be a reversal of U.S. policy
of no negotiations with terrorists.

616
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:15,115
Reporter: We're still waiting for
confirmation... Wait a minute...

617
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:22,864
There appears to be a group
exiting the compound at this time.

618
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,904
I'm counting nine people
being used as human shields...

619
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:50,891
Goran:
Go get them.

620
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,734
A woman has just burst out
of the building... She has a gun...

621
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:02,260
- She's grabbing one of the hostages...
- No...

622
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:04,772
Shit.

623
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:08,677
What the hell happened?!

624
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:30,532
I wonder if you two
could help me?

625
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:39,165
Reporter:
There's been no explanation...

626
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:41,870
A man has just stepped
out of the compound.

627
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:45,677
We can't tell whether he's a hostage,
or one of the terrorists.

628
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,615
What is he doing?

629
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:58,183
Reporter: He's walking
toward military personnel...

630
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:03,529
who have been on ready alert since
this seige started five hours ago.

631
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,907
You are...
General Swain?

632
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:27,387
He said...
you are a liar.

633
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:30,119
Where is the real Vojnovic?

634
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:33,458
That is the real Vojnovic.

635
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,657
Please...
you can't lie to me, sir.

636
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:41,227
He said he'll kill my wife
if you don't tell me the truth.

637
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:46,971
I'm not lying to you.

638
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:53,039
Thank you, sir.

639
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:58,176
- He'll kill my wife...
- Let him go.

640
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,689
Let me go!

641
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,061
Bastards.

642
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:12,261
He's testing us, sir.
Getting a confirmation on Vojnovic.

643
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:14,064
Give me the Pentagon.

644
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:26,875
He said...
that is the real Vojnovic.

645
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:34,919
Colonel Vojnovic had a few,
shall we say, unusual habits.

646
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:38,290
He believed that every second
of his time was precious.

647
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:42,821
He eliminated everything that might
take that time away from him.

648
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,628
So...

649
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:52,098
what is wrong
with this picture?

650
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:57,340
What's wrong in his dress,
that is time consuming?

651
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,110
Even in the smallest degree?

652
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,676
Goran: Come on, come
on, it cannot be so hard.

653
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,454
The shoes.

654
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:11,756
They have laces.

655
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:13,386
Goran:
Laces?

656
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:16,193
He never wore laces.

657
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:24,871
I know they don't
get laces in prison...

658
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:29,276
Those shoes...
he would have had to buy.

659
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,577
Never.

660
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:42,689
Goran: That general knew what
was at stake, and he lied.

661
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:45,694
He threw your husband's life away.

662
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:48,458
It wasn't me who killed him.

663
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,762
I put a little something
in your pocket...

664
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,997
that will show them
what you're feeling.

665
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,868
You lied.

666
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:49,387
Reporter: A man is down on the ground.
There's total chaos at this time...

667
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,420
I'm all right.

668
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:01,095
Someone's gotta call him.

669
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:03,162
I'm not calling him.

670
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:06,165
You should have told me
about Vojnovic.

671
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:08,871
You should have told me
this asshole was dead.

672
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:12,613
Pentagon: Sorry, General.
Couldn't chance a leak.

673
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:15,276
We are doing the best
we can here, General.

674
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:19,812
Why do I have a feeling you don't
have a clue what you're doing?

675
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:24,225
If you have an alternate strategy,
we'd love to hear it.

676
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:39,441
Okay, okay...
codes.

677
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:44,177
You were, of course, thinking...

678
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,044
that was the last place
they were gonna look?

679
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:48,949
I figured if they searched this far,
they wouldn't notice.

680
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:01,091
Before all hell broke loose...

681
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,121
I don't suppose you had time
in your chat with the ambassador...

682
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:04,860
to find out how to turn
these things off?

683
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,802
No.

684
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:10,670
- No worries.
- "No worries"?

685
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:12,731
- Kiss me for luck
- Last time...

686
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:15,972
...we kissed,
some very terrible people showed up.

687
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:41,365
Mitchell:
Pretty good.

688
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:43,429
Stubbs:
All right, listen.

689
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,906
I brought Swain up to date
on those tunnels under the embassy.

690
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:49,343
And I've got technicians who can
go down there with the codes...

691
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:50,902
and get close to the bomb.

692
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,745
If the terrorists see them coming,
that bomb's gonna start ticking.

693
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,547
No, no. We should position them
to get the jump on Goran.

694
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:59,418
That will allow them to get by,
close to the bomb...

695
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,082
they'll disarm it
before he gets back to them...

696
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,683
then, make a fast move...

697
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:05,694
Or, we could...

698
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:07,787
make it slower.

699
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,798
Could you run through
that first part again?

700
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:11,424
Yeah, that's fuckin' genius,
Stubbs.

701
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:13,094
I got it.

702
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:14,864
It's gonna take hostages.

703
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:18,169
Well, so is waiting.
You got any ideas?

704
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:28,206
I don't care who you are.

705
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:32,516
I only know that this museum
is older than your country...

706
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:36,389
and you are not digging a hole
in the middle of it.

707
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,945
Hold on a minute.
Who the hell are you two?

708
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:07,956
I'm afraid
I can't tell you that, sir.

709
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,320
Swain:
Who are they?

710
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,921
That's on a need-to-know basis.
Top secret.

711
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:15,862
Bullshit!

712
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:17,525
- Buck...
- No, no, no.

713
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:19,898
If this is gonna happen
on my watch over here...

714
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,098
then somebody is gonna
start talking, now!

715
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:28,205
They're computer specialists, Buck.

716
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:33,480
There's an atomic bomb in that
embassy that has to be disarmed.

717
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:38,787
It's in a small room attached
to the rear tunnel in the schematic.

718
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:44,952
You could have told me that.

719
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:47,224
I'm sorry.

720
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:54,936
Sorry.

721
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,200
Watch where you're pointing
that thing, huh?

722
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:17,720
Cakewalk.

723
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,064
Oh... shit.

724
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,332
What did you just do?

725
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,775
We got about ten seconds
to pull one of these wires...

726
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:37,745
red, white or green...

727
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,044
isn't green your favorite color?

728
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:43,917
All three?
How did you know that?

729
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,944
- I didn't.
- Hey...

730
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:48,855
they didn't bring this briefcase down
just for one of these things.

731
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:51,826
Probably got this entire matrix
wired up down here.

732
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,829
Steve, come on.
We've got to do this now.

733
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:57,094
Baby, if I don't do that now,
we can kiss that goodbye.

734
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:26,384
Get back!

735
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,098
Mitchell:
It's rigged, it's booby-trapped!

736
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:33,935
Shit...!

737
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:05,228
Red Caboose, Red Caboose...
Delta Charlie, over.

738
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:10,432
Red Caboose, Red Caboose,
Delta Charlie, over.

739
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:13,701
Radio:
Yes, General, go ahead.

740
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:15,505
Who's this?

741
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,637
It's Altschuler,
computer technician.

742
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,449
The tunnels...
they were rigged with explosives.

743
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:24,753
How many down?

744
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:27,956
I'm the only one left, sir.

745
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,521
Can you make it back?

746
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,086
Altschuler...?

747
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:37,860
Yes, I can make it back.

748
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:42,460
Roger that.

749
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,503
Swain: I need to tell
him about Vojnovic, now.

750
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:49,068
He's sitting on an atomic bomb.
That's the last resort.

751
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:51,102
You're not even sure
he knows about that bomb.

752
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:51,942
Pentagon:
No...

753
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:54,142
but at least with an assault,
we get the jump on him.

754
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:56,515
We tell him,
he pushes the button.

755
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,822
Reporter: The man walking toward
the embassy is General Swain...

756
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:02,380
Man:
Goran?

757
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,589
I don't understand
how you ended up here.

758
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:47,799
I never imagined you
as a terrorist.

759
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:48,996
Freedom fighter.

760
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:52,007
"Freedom fighter"?

761
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:57,342
Your cause doesn't define you as much
as killing civilians. Do you remember?

762
01:11:57,379 --> 01:12:00,177
I remember everything
they taught me over there.

763
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:07,216
Your Colonel Vojnovic was killed
leaving the prison today.

764
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:15,194
You kill another hostage,
and we're coming in.

765
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:19,095
You may have time to kill half
of them before I get in there...

766
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:22,433
but we are coming in.

767
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:26,737
- You have to surrender.
- Surrender?

768
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:30,802
I don't remember that class
at Ft. Bragg, Swain.

769
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,012
Goran...

770
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,442
Goran...

771
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:40,478
It would take an atomic bomb
to keep me out of there.

772
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:06,036
- Nice of you to join me.
- Sorry I'm late.

773
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:09,107
I've initiated the sequence
on both terminals.

774
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,417
Okay, okay...

775
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:15,287
Okay, I got the primary,
you've got the secondary.

776
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:17,224
Primary access code...

777
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:22,453
Done. You got the secondary
access code?

778
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:28,329
Done.
Disarmament activated, okay.

779
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,613
Time to detonation...?

780
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:44,846
What?

781
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:49,920
Erica, you got this?
"Time to detonation"...

782
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:55,557
The bomb is ticking.

783
01:13:56,932 --> 01:14:00,095
Did any of what I was saying earlier
make any sense?

784
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:02,968
About us not getting
what we deserve?

785
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:07,472
Oh, God, you...

786
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:10,536
you did this?

787
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:13,605
You just lit the fuse
on an atomic bomb.

788
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,415
For starters.

789
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:21,321
These guys shot their way in,
these terrorist pricks, you let them in?

790
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:25,660
They have not behaved
as we had planned.

791
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:29,061
But somebody needed to keep
the Army off while we get the money.

792
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:31,327
Money?
What money?

793
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:32,993
And where do you get
this "we" stuff?

794
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:36,471
The government will blame
the terrorists for taking it.

795
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:40,168
- Are you nuts?
- Okay...

796
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:44,475
how about we teach our government
a lesson for putting this thing here?

797
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:47,414
Very moral bullshit.

798
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:51,476
How about 20 people dead up there,
and there's gonna be two million?

799
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,886
How about since I know
you activated that bomb...

800
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:57,221
you've got an override code?
How about you give it to me, now?

801
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,090
Steve...

802
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:02,426
you've gotten everything
you're going to get from me today.

803
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,263
Except for these.

804
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:14,534
Put 'em on.

805
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:22,578
Detonation
in less than 30 minutes.

806
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:27,650
Buck...
Goran didn't take your news well.

807
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,249
We should have done it
my way from the get-go.

808
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:34,888
The president has given you
the go-ahead.

809
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:38,024
Stubbs:
Whatever means necessary.

810
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:41,562
"Wildfire" is hot.

811
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:44,834
Stubbs:
The terrorists have activated the bomb.

812
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:46,306
I'm sorry.

813
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:59,676
Seems Goran's not angry enough
about his dead colonel...

814
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,689
to blow Bucharest off the map.

815
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:05,784
For $25 million dollars, the Brown Hats
will let bygones be bygones.

816
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:43,954
Now that Vojnovic is dead,
we should ask for someone else.

817
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,758
Yes?

818
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:52,463
It's Swain.

819
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:55,032
Why don't we ask for money?

820
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:02,411
Goran, for God sakes,
what are you doing?

821
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:05,717
Same thing we have been
doing all day.

822
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:08,246
We still want that plane.

823
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,622
Fully fueled.

824
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:13,355
I need confirmation that nuke
has been disarmed...

825
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:17,456
or we're not talking any further.
You're under twenty minutes.

826
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:20,798
This is no time to play games.
What is it you want?

827
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:24,004
Goran...

828
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:25,267
Goran!

829
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:35,773
Did you ever find Erica Long?

830
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:39,186
What?

831
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:46,093
Swain:
All right, listen up.

832
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:48,392
Your lives, and those
of thousands of others...

833
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:50,295
as well as the reputation
of your country

834
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,960
depends on how fast
you do your duty.

835
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,491
Move!

836
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,880
Go.

837
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:30,061
Push these people down!

838
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:32,335
Move!
Down the stairs!

839
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:13,812
Hostages are against the south wall.
Stay away from the south wall.

840
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,940
Go, go!

841
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,710
Where is Goran?

842
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,215
Bitch.

843
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:21,067
Move it, move it!

844
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:24,375
- Target secure, sir.
- How long before we're toast?

845
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:26,744
- Nine minutes.
- Where's the egghead?

846
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:29,011
Sir?

847
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,779
Sir, here I am, sir.

848
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:33,583
All right, let's go.

849
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:38,889
How much are you
extorting them for?

850
01:21:39,594 --> 01:21:41,619
What do you care?

851
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:44,723
I've trusted you
with our cause.

852
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:47,257
When you told me about that cause,
you never mentioned...

853
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:51,238
putting a gun to a kid's head,
or shooting a hostage every hour.

854
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:54,538
Is that how you intend
to get respect for your cause?

855
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,134
This coming from you...

856
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:58,645
who's holding the whole city hostage?

857
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:02,207
Now... you're gonna
shut that thing down...

858
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:05,219
and stand by, while I make
some real demands.

859
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:23,264
Seems to me...

860
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:26,001
we both got fucked here.

861
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:29,072
Maybe you got it worse.

862
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:05,410
Okay, Erica.

863
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:09,283
Game is over.
End of the line.

864
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:11,683
The jig, baby, is up.

865
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:16,123
Now, give me the code,
before I kill you.

866
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:19,752
It's too late, Steve. You shoot me,
you never get past that bomb.

867
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:23,355
I can't do anything with it
if you leave me here alone, can I?

868
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:27,065
It was never supposed
to go this far...

869
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:29,070
but it's too late
to change anything now.

870
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:31,072
Erica...!

871
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:41,348
That's it.
Okay, get in there. Go, go!

872
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:45,077
Hey... hey!
Have you seen Steve Mitchell?

873
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:49,419
Jesus.

874
01:23:49,457 --> 01:23:51,789
Trooper...?

875
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:01,396
- Dad! Hey, hey!
- What...?

876
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:03,870
- The tunnel was sealed.
- Take my son outta here, please!

877
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:08,069
Get him out of here!
Hold it, hold it!

878
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:11,875
I'm the bomb guy, don't shoot!
I'm with the bomb!

879
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:13,881
I gotta get to the bomb!

880
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:20,383
- You try all the back doors yet?
- Closed down. I don't get it.

881
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:25,817
Damn, she loaded a virus in it.

882
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:28,494
Shit.

883
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:31,362
Any other back ways
you know of?

884
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:32,832
It's too late...
It's just too late.

885
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:35,301
- Think!
- I'm thinking, I'm...

886
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:39,602
There's only one way we can go
with this, and that's straight up.

887
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:41,006
General, I'll make a deal
with you.

888
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:45,803
Give me a minute,
will ya?

889
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:53,081
You get my kid out, and I'll take
this thing out by hand.

890
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:56,987
Got about, I guess...
90 seconds.

891
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:01,385
Do it.

892
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:07,298
He's gonna take out
the core of the bomb.

893
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:10,065
The radiation will melt him
like butter.

894
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:13,131
Swain: Altschuler, shut up! Get movin'!

895
01:25:13,174 --> 01:25:15,142
Go! Go! Go!

896
01:25:17,846 --> 01:25:19,746
Swain:
I said, go, Sergeant!

897
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:22,272
I know he's doing this
for his country, and all that...

898
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:23,579
Hey!...

899
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:25,745
I doubt that, son.
They don't pay enough.

900
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,618
Maybe he's doing it
for all the people this has killed...

901
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:30,249
Maybe he's doing it for you.
Think about that.

902
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,259
Now, run, boy!

903
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,502
You got ten seconds, babe.

904
01:26:21,543 --> 01:26:24,341
I love it when you're sentimental,
Bubbles.

905
01:26:24,379 --> 01:26:26,279
- Calling me "Babe".
- Erica!

906
01:26:27,148 --> 01:26:29,048
Give...!

907
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:31,779
Give me the code.

908
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:34,287
I just gave it to you.

909
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:01,640
Sir?

910
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:54,591
Hi, what are you wearing?

911
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,435
Twenty-five million dollars.

912
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:03,205
That ought to be enough
to give you three days at Chanel.

913
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:07,813
Mitchell:
Listen, downstairs, I was...

914
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:12,411
I knew you wouldn't really
let that bomb explode... would ya?

915
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:15,513
Oh, Steve, you really should
get to know me better.

916
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:17,820
I intend to, baby.
I'm comin' after ya.

917
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:20,350
Good. I'm counting on it.

918
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,699
I can hear you breathing.

919
01:28:34,742 --> 01:28:38,269
You know, you really should
keep that phone close.

920
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:41,407
Erica: It'll make it
easier for you to find me.

921
01:28:57,465 --> 01:28:59,433
What's the matter?

922
01:29:27,929 --> 01:29:30,989
So, first night in town,
what do you think we should do?

923
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:34,697
Well, I hear the Romanian girls
are pretty sexy.

924
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:37,534
No, you blew that one.
Had you fixed up...

925
01:29:37,572 --> 01:29:38,800
and what did you do?
You got off the bus.

926
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:41,138
- I never got on the bus.
- Well, there you go.

927
01:29:41,175 --> 01:29:43,200
Well, then I might as well
go home and live with Grandma.

928
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:45,405
Grandma?
Where'd you get that idea?

929
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:49,678
Who said that? Did I say that?
You're stickin' with me.

930
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:53,881
What do you say...
we hang around Europe for a while?

931
01:29:53,921 --> 01:29:56,549
Another embassy?

932
01:29:56,591 --> 01:29:59,059
No, let's just say...

933
01:29:59,093 --> 01:30:01,721
I'm expecting a call.
