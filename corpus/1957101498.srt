It looks like there was
some kind of a struggle.

thrown about.

something bad had happened.

This morning at the station, you didn't...
you didn't mention a struggle.

570
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:38,398
Well, I tried to tell you.

571
00:28:38,465 --> 00:28:40,166
But then all those
teenagers came in,

572
00:28:40,234 --> 00:28:41,935
and then no one
would listen to me.

573
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:44,271
- Hm.
- When did you realize your husband was missing?

574
00:28:44,338 --> 00:28:46,038
This morning.
When I woke up,

575
00:28:46,105 --> 00:28:47,541
I realized Karl
hadn't come home last night.

576
00:28:47,608 --> 00:28:49,443
And then I came down
and saw the kitchen

577
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,411
and the great room and-and...

578
00:28:51,478 --> 00:28:53,580
- And I knew something was wrong.
- Mm.

579
00:28:53,647 --> 00:28:57,149
You didn't notice the kitchen
or the great room last night?

580
00:28:57,217 --> 00:28:59,353
No. I...
Well, it was my birthday,

581
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:01,655
and we had dinner reservations
at La Femme Aimée.

That swanky new
French restaurant downtown.

583
00:29:04,224 --> 00:29:06,293
But I was exhausted
when I got home,

584
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,896
so I went upstairs to close my eyes
for a minute and do some affirmations,

585
00:29:08,962 --> 00:29:11,198
and I knew something was wrong
'cause Karl never woke me.

586
00:29:11,265 --> 00:29:12,666
And I came downstairs,
and then I saw this,

587
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:15,602
and Karl was gone.

588
00:29:18,205 --> 00:29:19,806

- "Affirmations?"
- Yeah.

you are special."

00:29:29,383 --> 00:29:31,184
Uh, can you think of anyone

592
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:32,886
that that might want to harm
your husband?

593
00:29:32,953 --> 00:29:35,522
Oh, my goodness, no.

594
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:38,458
I mean, I-I don't think so.

595

00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:24,325
Oh... Well, you and Petey
don't visit us much,

875
00:42:24,391 --> 00:42:26,159
so it's not surprising
that we don't know

876
00:42:26,226 --> 00:42:28,861
what's happening
in each other's lives.

877
00:42:28,928 --> 00:42:30,863
Did Karl walk out on you?

878
00:42:31,964 --> 00:42:33,467
Excuse me?

879
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:35,134
Karl isn't the guy
who gets kidnapped

880
00:42:35,202 --> 00:42:36,869
because he cracked
a missing girl case.

881
00:42:36,936 --> 00:42:39,373
He's the guy
who runs off on his wife

882
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,709
and disappears
to start a new life.

883

884
00:42:43,377 --> 00:42:45,312
just up and walks out
on you one day,

885
00:42:45,379 --> 00:42:47,715

a kidnapping to save face.

than a deadbeat one, right?

ever happened to Petey...

been up to no good.

1223

Detective Harris' feeling?

Well, I definitely think
Mrs. Buttons is strange.

she has anything to do

disappearance.

Right now, our strongest lead
is the bank.

1246
00:58:52,646 --> 00:58:54,180
Karl was laundering money,

1247
00:58:54,248 --> 00:58:55,982
and he's somehow
connected to these men
