1
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:50,989
Yo! Pat, don't you like us no more?

2
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,588
Fucking punk.

3
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:12,673
I trusted you dog.

4
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:17,671
Fucking shouldn't have.
I never fucking trusted you.

5
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,911
I trusted you.

6
00:02:21,716 --> 00:02:24,469
Motherfucker.

7
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:40,912
Yo! Motherfucker's still smiling dog.

8
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:42,634
Yo!! You want us to dump the body?

9
00:02:42,716 --> 00:02:46,026
No. Leave the Motherfucker
to die right there.

10
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:48,307
Go get my table ready!

11
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:51,076
I gotta go get my shit.

12
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:31,227
My brother always used to tell me
that he was smart.

13
00:03:34,356 --> 00:03:36,711
I never believed him,

14
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:43,270
whatever, not with your grades,
I told him

15
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:50,835
I'm not book smart,
I'm a different kind of smart

16
00:03:51,116 --> 00:03:55,314
It's like a special gift,
he used to say.

17
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:04,553
I'd laugh at him.
He's always bragging.

18
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:11,627
He'd tell me that
he'd notice things about people.

19
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:19,629
He'd notice the way they would act.

20
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:24,345
And the shit they say

21
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:31,467
Hey kid, don't let them wet my car

22
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:35,947
He figured that
it would come in handy someday.

23
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:46,666
Songkran; the Thai New Year,

24
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:50,590
used to be a lot more about tradition.

25
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,714
My grandma said that back in Thailand...

26
00:04:53,796 --> 00:04:57,186
the whole water ritual
was very important.

27
00:04:57,476 --> 00:05:00,388
I don't know
what ritual she's talking about.

28
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:05,704
All I know is that it's
just one big water fight.

29
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:51,191
To bad for that kid, Yo!
He gonna lose his car right now.

30
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:56,189
Papa's gonna have to send money
for another car.

31
00:05:58,116 --> 00:05:59,993
Check this out.

32
00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:41,066
Watch it punk.

33
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:01,666
Yo! Yo! Man I thought

34
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:05,192
Chill man. Don't worry about it!
Come on. Let's go. Let's go!

35
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:09,275
Yo!! What's the nicest car

36
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:09,993

37
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:11,668
Say in the last 20 mins. Man.

38
00:07:11,756 --> 00:07:13,474
What man?

39
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:15,194
Fool you don't even know
which car it is?

40
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:17,870
Na Man.
Oh! Fuck Man.

41
00:07:19,276 --> 00:07:21,665
Yo! Chill out man don't worry about it.

42
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:24,668
Yo! Quit your scratching already Khan.

43
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:30,588
Where am I supposed take that
car again, I forgot?

44
00:07:30,676 --> 00:07:31,711
You forgot!

45
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:34,310

00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:38,954
Main Street.

48
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:42,392
The warehouse
you were at just the other day.

49
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:45,513
Main Street, you got it?

50
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:50,429
Do you remember what car it is
or did you forget that shit too?

51
00:07:50,676 --> 00:07:53,144
The one with all the fucking
sticker on it, man.

52
00:07:53,316 --> 00:07:56,114
Yo, like that one.

53
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:05,994
Yo, stop you scratching already Khan,

Man shut the fuck up, man.

56
00:08:09,796 --> 00:08:12,913
If that Motherfucker finds out
you're a dead man.

57
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:16,466
Shit then I gotta move out of here.

58
00:08:16,556 --> 00:08:18,706
Fool you said you
were going to borrow the car.

59
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:21,788
Then why did you go steal one then?

60
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:26,631
Come with you man damn why did I.

00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,627

63
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:32,116
Man, my mom's car is alright man.

64
00:08:32,196 --> 00:08:34,266
Did you say you fucking

65
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:36,995
Yo! After tonight

Don't worry about that guys man,

00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,910
they won't even know
what fucking hit them.

69
00:08:49,276 --> 00:08:52,666
Stop! It's the red light!

70
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,670
Should we tighten the safety belt?

71
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:17,031
What's up dog? I know this isn't your ride.

72
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,835
Shit you know we got next though, right?

73

76
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:31,545
All show you who's the bitch
when I come back for my money.

77
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:41,307
Let me get out of the car man

78
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:43,387
Good luck Man.

79
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,115

00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:48,387
Till I get paid nobody eats.

00:18:35,756 --> 00:18:39,351
Ok. Ok. That's good.

109
00:18:39,796 --> 00:18:43,266
Hi, Mom come in. Let me help you.

110
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,353
Did you see Pat? He's not here.

111
00:18:46,436 --> 00:18:48,745
If I saw him do you think
I'll be pushing this?

112
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,794
He's useless.

113
00:19:11,236 --> 00:19:14,034
I bring you some water later.

114
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:20,746
Ploy put everything in the van,
Pat's not coming.

115
00:19:20,836 --> 00:19:25,193
Today you have to help grandma, okay?

116
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:32,393
Keep a look out, ok?
Grandma's eyes are bad.

117
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,224
Be careful, grandma!

118
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:03,989
That's my boy Charlie...

119
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:07,227
you might want to think twice
about fucking with him.

120
00:21:08,316 --> 00:21:09,874
What the fuck are you doing here man?

121
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:12,675
Get the fuck out of my gym.

122
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:17,831
Look fool!

123
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:24,831
What, you mean him?
Fucking you!

124
00:22:13,156 --> 00:22:16,432
So what, is this what you have
to talk to me about?

125
00:22:16,516 --> 00:22:18,984
You talk like a gangster dog,

126
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:21,510
your uncle must have taught you well.

127
00:22:21,596 --> 00:22:22,915
What uncle?

128
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:27,512
Yo, I heard some what happened to him
that's fucked up.

129
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,191
So, I didn't know him.

130
00:22:32,876 --> 00:22:36,107
Yo, you sick of the Restaurant,

131
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:37,424
I guess it's fine for now.

132
00:22:37,516 --> 00:22:39,711
Doesn't seem it's fine for now,

133
00:22:39,796 --> 00:22:43,152
it seems you want to move
onto something else, Yo.

134
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:45,671
Guess will see then, right.

135
00:22:45,956 --> 00:22:50,393
So, how's Pearl? How's she?

136
00:22:50,476 --> 00:22:53,070
Don't know, I haven't seen her.

137
00:22:53,356 --> 00:22:56,587
Well, the next time you see her
tell her I send my love, alright?

138
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,348
Man you know I ain't gonna tell her that.

139
00:22:58,436 --> 00:22:59,107
Why not?

140
00:22:59,196 --> 00:23:01,835
Cause she be fucking pissed
if she knows I was here.

141
00:23:02,196 --> 00:23:05,825
What, you ain't wanna be here
or what, Motherfucker?

142
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:08,305
I didn't say that, did I?

143
00:23:11,636 --> 00:23:16,312
You got a smart mother fucking
mouth, watch it.

144
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:38,830
Hi, my girl.

145
00:23:45,276 --> 00:23:48,712
Doing your homework?

146
00:23:49,356 --> 00:23:52,905
Did Pat help out today?

147
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:57,113
Ploy, you didn't hear what I said?

148
00:23:57,196 --> 00:24:00,268
No, he didn't, but we were fine...

149
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:04,110
grandma just hit the curb twice
and that's it.

150
00:24:04,196 --> 00:24:07,347
Shit... Pat's useless.

151
00:24:07,436 --> 00:24:09,870
What did he do all day?

152
00:24:09,956 --> 00:24:16,270
Lucky grandma's helping
us out or else we'll be in trouble.

153
00:24:18,716 --> 00:24:27,545
Help me unpack dinner.

154

Alright man, I'll be there.

00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:05,356
Alright yo, what happened to my money?

161
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:07,711

You know who that was.

166
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:17,507
What are you doing, hanging out
with that punk?

167
00:26:17,596 --> 00:26:19,826
Nothing, none of your business, really.

168
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:22,032
What do you mean nothing

169

170
00:26:23,836 --> 00:26:27,749
Yo, tell dad what you want
I don't give a shit no more.

171
00:26:35,036 --> 00:26:37,425
What are you looking at?

172
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:48,986
Business, what business?

173
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:52,466
Your business is to help
out at the restaurant and Than temple,

174
00:26:52,716 --> 00:26:54,593
that's it ok?

175
00:26:54,796 --> 00:26:57,515
Don't you know
we're having a tough time?

176
00:26:57,596 --> 00:27:00,827
Don't you see everyone's helping out?

177
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:02,952
You don't do shit.

178
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:04,953
What are you thinking?

179
00:27:05,036 --> 00:27:09,985
You wanna be like hector down there

180
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:14,035
or you want to end up
dead like your uncle.

181
00:27:15,796 --> 00:27:17,707
Have some respect,

182
00:27:17,796 --> 00:27:21,709
I'm your father god damn it. Respect.
Daddy.

183
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:52,270
Fuck you look at F.O.B.

184
00:28:13,356 --> 00:28:17,269
Daddy. Did you get tax papers yet?

185
00:28:17,356 --> 00:28:19,870
Henry has time to help you now.

186
00:28:19,956 --> 00:28:24,188
Oh now he has time to look at them.

187
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,630
While you know it's tax season...

188
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:28,788
and it's the busiest time of the year.

189
00:28:29,756 --> 00:28:34,307
While I don't have any papers ready.

190
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:38,555
Why not, you can't avoid this
the IRS people...

191
00:28:38,636 --> 00:28:41,104
they're serious people
they're ready to take everything.

192
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:43,027
I don't owe them any thing.

193
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:44,947
Yes, you do.

194
00:28:45,396 --> 00:28:49,230
Look, Henry has time to help you now.

195
00:28:52,636 --> 00:28:55,912
Maybe I don't need his help.

196
00:29:01,396 --> 00:29:04,433
Henry's a great lawyer!

197
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:09,709
Daddy... Are you still mad at me?

198
00:29:09,796 --> 00:29:14,790
I don't get it why you move out with Henry.

199
00:29:14,956 --> 00:29:19,029
What am I gonna tell people...
when they ask about you?

200
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:23,632
I know this ain't Thailand,
but I can't accepted.

201
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:28,633
At least he should ask me first.

202
00:29:30,516 --> 00:29:33,667
I'm gonna go help grandma close up.

203
00:29:55,356 --> 00:29:59,952
Excuse me, is my dish ready?

204
00:30:12,796 --> 00:30:19,269
Hurry up and eat your food.
We close in 10 mins.

205
00:31:50,236 --> 00:31:51,635
Goldie, I'm here.

206
00:31:51,796 --> 00:31:53,468
That's great, sit down.

207
00:31:53,556 --> 00:31:55,592
Motherfucker you best get that
look off your face...

208
00:31:55,676 --> 00:31:58,065
before I shove this Singha right up your ass.

209
00:31:58,156 --> 00:32:00,306
Shut up, Charlie.

210
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:04,033
Yo, ready to do some work
for me kid?

211
00:32:04,196 --> 00:32:05,185
Ah ya, Goldie.

212
00:32:05,276 --> 00:32:11,875
Good, see I have some concerns...

213
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:16,588
about mother fucking
Armenians like that...

214
00:32:16,676 --> 00:32:20,988
selling dope on my streets.

215
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:36,434
Yo, Pat what you think we should...

216
00:32:36,516 --> 00:32:40,668
Where the fuck did he?

217
00:32:54,476 --> 00:32:57,195
Now what the fuck is he doing?

218
00:33:05,876 --> 00:33:08,185
Bitch.

219
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:17,268
You shit! Now that's what I'm talking about.

220
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:48,464
Get outta car.

221
00:36:05,236 --> 00:36:10,310
Uh... I thought you were my brother.

222
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:17,947
How did you ever get that scare?

223
00:36:22,996 --> 00:36:25,385
Pardon me, sir?

224
00:36:26,236 --> 00:36:28,545
You speak Thai pretty good.

225
00:36:28,636 --> 00:36:33,107
I speak Thai at home everyday.

226
00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:36,711
Sir, you just moved from Thailand?

227
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:39,828
I came from somewhere else.

228
00:36:40,636 --> 00:36:44,709
What's your name, sir?
I'm Ploy. I live upstairs.

229
00:36:46,236 --> 00:36:53,551
I'm Dan and please stop calling me sir.

230
00:36:53,636 --> 00:36:56,912
You already know which room I live in.

231
00:36:57,796 --> 00:37:02,153
Uh, do you speak English?

232
00:37:02,996 --> 00:37:05,874
Accent not so good.

233
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:30,826
See! That what you get.

234
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,751
They watch out.
Be gentle with my vegetables, son.

235
00:37:42,836 --> 00:37:44,428
Yes.

236
00:37:44,516 --> 00:37:47,269
Oh! You're that,

237
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:51,315
Good, then please help me carry my bags.

238
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:00,987
Ok, I'm going to give all
these papers to Henry...

239
00:38:01,076 --> 00:38:02,953
and he'll take a look at them next week...

240
00:38:03,036 --> 00:38:05,834
and he'll be able to tell
how much we have to pay.

241
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,713
Payment?

242
00:38:07,876 --> 00:38:10,549
Henry said he was going to fight the case.

243
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:13,673
But this is the IRS
you have to pay you owe tax, ok?

244
00:38:13,756 --> 00:38:15,075
If you don't pay they will take every thing.

245
00:38:15,156 --> 00:38:18,068
Do you understand?

246
00:38:19,836 --> 00:38:25,911
Pearl, your dad is hard headed
but don't raised your voice.

247
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:28,347
Dan?

248
00:38:30,036 --> 00:38:32,789
Here is my nephew Pearl

249
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:49,224
Can I help you?

250
00:38:49,316 --> 00:38:54,595
This is Dan, he just moved in.

251
00:38:54,676 --> 00:38:57,065
He's even helped me with the bags.

252
00:38:57,156 --> 00:39:01,672
Thank you, why don't you stay for dinner.

253
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:06,750
May be next time. Thank you anyway.

254
00:39:06,836 --> 00:39:09,225
Thanks again.

255
00:39:23,116 --> 00:39:25,311
You've been doing good dog.

256
00:39:25,716 --> 00:39:26,990
Yo, man.

257
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:29,705
Yo, I had a feeling about you,

258
00:39:29,796 --> 00:39:35,189

00:39:38,396 --> 00:39:42,275

and that's my word.

261
00:39:42,356 --> 00:39:44,551
Alright, yo.

262
00:41:17,796 --> 00:41:20,594
Dan, are you there?

263
00:41:21,516 --> 00:41:23,507
Dan?

264
00:41:26,156 --> 00:41:29,148
(Grandma)
Just wanted me to bring you this.

265
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:32,273
You meet her today, right.

266
00:41:35,236 --> 00:41:37,545
Are you okay?

267
00:41:41,796 --> 00:41:45,630
Please, tell grandma that I said thank you.

268
00:41:59,396 --> 00:42:00,749
Eat up, dog.

269
00:42:00,836 --> 00:42:03,225
We got a lot head of us tonight, man.

270
00:42:03,316 --> 00:42:06,353
Oh ya, what's your plan man.

271
00:42:06,596 --> 00:42:08,905
You'll see.

272
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:11,510
Someone's busted.

273
00:42:15,556 --> 00:42:20,072
Ain't that the fucking F.O.B.
From your building, dog.

274
00:42:20,236 --> 00:42:23,148
Yo, that looks like him.

275
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:24,589
He says he comes from Thailand.

276
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:27,588
I'll take care of this.

277
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:29,946
Do you know why they stop you?

278
00:42:30,236 --> 00:42:33,069
I have no license.

279
00:42:33,156 --> 00:42:35,511
I just moved here.

280
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:37,507
You on the run.

281
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:41,393
OK, I give you a break...

282
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:46,027
this time next you won't be so lucky,
understand?

283
00:43:50,956 --> 00:43:54,232
Everyone needs to get back in line guys.

284
00:43:59,756 --> 00:44:02,987
What's up Hollywood, good to see you.

285
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:05,592
Good to see you, Goldie.

286
00:44:06,036 --> 00:44:09,790
My boy Pat's wise guy in training.

287
00:44:09,996 --> 00:44:11,668
Please, Goldie.

288
00:44:11,756 --> 00:44:15,192
For real, don't be surprised

289
00:44:15,276 --> 00:44:16,186
Well, see, baby.

00:44:17,116 --> 00:44:18,469
Yo, he's inside brother.

292
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:19,306
Can we get at him?

293
00:44:19,396 --> 00:44:20,749
Yo, go ahead.

294
00:44:20,836 --> 00:44:23,430
Thank you, man.

295
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:26,829
Get inside bitch,

296
00:44:26,996 --> 00:44:32,070
Get - Go ahead.

297
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:45,989
Man, come on?

298
00:46:16,636 --> 00:46:17,512
Hey! Kid.

299
00:46:17,596 --> 00:46:19,666
What's up man?

300
00:46:20,116 --> 00:46:21,549
Everything cool?

301
00:46:21,636 --> 00:46:22,432

302
00:46:22,516 --> 00:46:24,108

303
00:46:24,196 --> 00:46:28,269
It's alright man, take care of it.

304
00:46:29,676 --> 00:46:32,349
What the fuck is wrong with him?

305
00:46:32,636 --> 00:46:35,469
That motherfucker's just stoned.
Don't worry about him, dog.

306
00:46:37,516 --> 00:46:40,269
That motherfucker's always stoned.

307
00:46:41,036 --> 00:46:42,355
Yo, Pat, let's go man.

308
00:46:42,436 --> 00:46:44,188
You need me boss?

309
00:46:44,276 --> 00:46:48,713
No, just wait here. I'll be back.

310
00:46:48,956 --> 00:46:52,710
Besides your two seconds away
from losing 530 dollars - Fuck.

311
00:46:52,796 --> 00:46:54,991
Show me man.

312
00:47:04,276 --> 00:47:05,072
That shit don't count.

313
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:08,307
Yes, it does.
No, it doesn't.

314
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:14,711
So where and the fuck you been?

317
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:36,989
Pretty good -

318
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:44,032
So you are the new bad Motherfucker.

00:47:44,716 --> 00:47:49,312
Yo, this is Jules man

00:47:49,396 --> 00:47:51,785
Oh yes Chan,

321
00:47:51,876 --> 00:47:57,508
he was one crazy Motherfucker
that who you took after.

322
00:47:57,596 --> 00:48:00,235
I didn't really know my uncle.

323
00:48:00,436 --> 00:48:03,394
From all the shit you been up to...

324
00:48:03,476 --> 00:48:05,387
you must know something about him.

325
00:48:05,476 --> 00:48:09,105
It's in the blood baby,
it's in the blood.

326
00:48:11,316 --> 00:48:15,275
So what's this my bonus?

327
00:48:15,596 --> 00:48:18,110
Employ of the month right here.

328
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:21,268
He needs a little Pun man, hook it up.

329
00:48:21,396 --> 00:48:26,390
Alright then
so what do you have in mind partner.

330
00:48:26,476 --> 00:48:30,469
Do you like them short, tall...

331
00:48:30,556 --> 00:48:36,506
or you like one with big titts
or perhaps those little pointy ones?

332
00:48:36,596 --> 00:48:38,666
I like'em blond.

333
00:48:39,356 --> 00:48:41,824
Pat the bad Motherfucker.

334
00:48:43,356 --> 00:48:49,226
I know exactly the girl - K.C.

335
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,834
Good shit.

336
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:54,032
Dope man.

337
00:49:54,276 --> 00:49:58,189
I'm finally getting super pure
products again.

338
00:49:58,276 --> 00:50:00,153
I can see that.

339
00:50:00,236 --> 00:50:02,352
But it's going to cost you.

340
00:50:02,436 --> 00:50:04,870
You jacking prices up on me again.

341
00:50:04,956 --> 00:50:08,744
The price of production has gone up.
What can I say?

342
00:50:08,836 --> 00:50:11,350
Your cost goes up so I pay for it.

343
00:50:11,436 --> 00:50:17,147
If you don't like it,
get it from somewhere else.

344
00:50:25,236 --> 00:50:27,545
You're biting me.

345
00:50:28,116 --> 00:50:30,266
How old are you any way?

346
00:50:30,356 --> 00:50:32,267
Old enough.

347
00:50:32,356 --> 00:50:34,916
You're so beautiful.

348
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,032
Say it again.

349
00:50:41,036 --> 00:50:44,585
So beautiful and sweetly cool.

350
00:50:46,596 --> 00:50:51,147
What are you doing?

351
00:50:56,316 --> 00:50:58,511
It's not in.

352
00:51:00,956 --> 00:51:05,234
Oh my god, is this your first time?

353
00:51:05,556 --> 00:51:08,024
Ya.

354
00:51:16,556 --> 00:51:18,831
So beautiful sweetly,

355
00:51:20,916 --> 00:51:23,225
so beautiful.

356
00:51:23,356 --> 00:51:26,393
Say it again.

357
00:51:38,996 --> 00:51:43,194
Henry and I will stop by tomorrow
with a paper work.

358
00:51:43,276 --> 00:51:45,551
All right, then.

359
00:51:45,996 --> 00:51:48,066
You know Henry did a really good job.

360
00:51:48,156 --> 00:51:51,546
Henry said two years of payment
and you'll be done.

361
00:51:51,636 --> 00:51:53,672
What, did you say two years?

362
00:51:53,756 --> 00:51:55,348
I thought we were going to help dad.

363
00:51:55,436 --> 00:51:57,188
While he's just paying
half of what he owes.

364
00:51:57,276 --> 00:51:59,744
What only half.
Come on man that's bullshit.

365
00:51:59,836 --> 00:52:02,987
Pat, you don't know
shit shut the hell up.

366
00:52:03,076 --> 00:52:04,145
Ok, that's enough...

367
00:52:04,236 --> 00:52:06,352
I got enough headache now if papa knew.

368
00:52:06,436 --> 00:52:08,392
Man, I really thought
we were going to help dad, man...

369
00:52:08,476 --> 00:52:10,114
you and fucking
Henry's full of shit, man.

370
00:52:10,196 --> 00:52:12,869
I'm fuck'en out of here.

371
00:52:30,716 --> 00:52:31,705
Why you smoking shit?

372
00:52:31,796 --> 00:52:33,787
If Papa knew -
you know you'd be in big trouble.

373
00:52:33,876 --> 00:52:36,344
Just give me that -

374
00:52:42,676 --> 00:52:44,507
Your such a dork sometimes.

375
00:52:44,596 --> 00:52:46,871
I got another one.

376
00:52:55,956 --> 00:52:59,028
Thank you lord.

377
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:00,547
What do you want?

378
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:01,751
What is your problem?

379
00:53:01,836 --> 00:53:03,554
You know dad is having
a rough time right now.

380
00:53:03,636 --> 00:53:05,866
IRS is trying to take everything away.

381
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:07,230
At least Pearl's trying to help.

382
00:53:07,316 --> 00:53:08,874
Look, she's not the only one
trying to help.

383
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:11,151
What do you do?
You don't even go to work any more.

384
00:53:11,236 --> 00:53:14,069
Just don't worry about it, ok.

385
00:53:14,156 --> 00:53:18,786
I mean you don't even talk
to me any more.

386
00:53:18,876 --> 00:53:20,673
Look, I'm sorry about that, ok.

387
00:53:20,756 --> 00:53:22,587
But it will all be over soon.

388
00:53:22,676 --> 00:53:24,507
I got it all figured out now.

389
00:53:24,596 --> 00:53:27,588
Got what figured out?
What can you do?

390
00:53:27,676 --> 00:53:30,144
You just don't need to know
right now, ok.

391
00:53:30,236 --> 00:53:31,794
Is this about Goldie?

392
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:33,355
You know, he's not a good person.

393
00:53:33,436 --> 00:53:35,745
Do you want to end up like Uncle Chan?

394
00:53:35,836 --> 00:53:38,714
Look, you know I'm not like Uncle Chan.

395
00:53:40,756 --> 00:53:43,111
Come here.
No, get off me.

396
00:53:43,196 --> 00:53:46,074
Look Ploy, I don't need you
worry right now, ok?

397
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:49,273
I just don't need it.

398
00:54:04,636 --> 00:54:08,311
So I'll need you to sign the bottom
of these papers, please.

399
00:54:09,836 --> 00:54:18,392
Dad, this is an agreement
that you have to pay for IRS annually.

400
00:54:21,316 --> 00:54:25,389
Dad, sign it.

401
00:54:26,156 --> 00:54:30,308
Henry thank you for all of the work
that you did,

402
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:33,986
But...

403
00:54:34,676 --> 00:54:36,746
But what?

404
00:54:36,956 --> 00:54:40,187
But I think I will take care of it by myself.

405
00:54:41,556 --> 00:54:44,992
He did everything for you.
How can you do this?

406
00:54:45,076 --> 00:54:47,226
He's been doing this all week.

407
00:54:47,316 --> 00:54:48,954
I pay for your time.

408
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:50,867
That's not the point,
Dad.

409
00:54:50,956 --> 00:54:52,025
That is the point.

410
00:54:52,116 --> 00:54:54,755
Somebody have to pay.

411
00:54:59,516 --> 00:55:03,475
Don't look at me like that -
I'll wait in the car.

412
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,392
Dan?

413
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:19,635
My grandma invites you for dinner.

414
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:22,025
I just went to your room
but you weren't there.

415
00:55:22,116 --> 00:55:24,027
I figured you would be here.

416
00:55:24,116 --> 00:55:29,509
Please tell her I said thanks and
I'll see you then.

417
00:55:45,196 --> 00:55:48,506
Where my soup, Ploy?

418
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:54,626
She made the soup herself.

419
00:55:56,116 --> 00:55:58,835
So, how long have you been here?

420
00:56:00,636 --> 00:56:04,311
I was in San Francisco for
the last 2 years before I move here.

421
00:56:04,476 --> 00:56:08,389
Oh! Yeah... what were you doing there?

422
00:56:09,436 --> 00:56:11,074
I worked in a restaurant.

423
00:56:11,156 --> 00:56:12,953
Really, that's good.

424
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,106
He's probably just a dish washer.

425
00:56:15,196 --> 00:56:17,790
You got a social?

426
00:56:19,236 --> 00:56:22,512
Have you got a work permit?

427
00:56:23,556 --> 00:56:24,989
No, sir.

428
00:56:25,196 --> 00:56:27,756
So, where do you work now?

429
00:56:28,516 --> 00:56:31,588
I haven't got a chance to got a job.

430
00:56:32,676 --> 00:56:37,625
I suppose I should get one soon.

431
00:56:37,716 --> 00:56:40,992
Welcome to work
with me if you want a job.

432
00:56:41,076 --> 00:56:45,672
We're about to need help.

433
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:48,066
Shit man.

434
00:56:48,156 --> 00:56:50,750
Can you drive?

435
00:56:51,236 --> 00:56:52,305
Yes.

436
00:56:52,396 --> 00:56:54,512
Fuck this, I'm out of here.

437
00:56:54,596 --> 00:56:56,951
Say Pat.

438
00:56:57,156 --> 00:57:01,991
So Dan would you come to work with me?

439
00:57:02,116 --> 00:57:04,027
Yes.

440
00:57:13,316 --> 00:57:16,945
Henry, I'm really sorry about my dad...

441
00:57:17,036 --> 00:57:19,345
he can get really stubborn sometimes.

442
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,826
Really, that must be where you got it from.

443
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:25,828
I knew he was going to pull
something today.

444
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:29,385
Look, I know he'll come around.

445
00:57:29,476 --> 00:57:31,228
He just needs some time that's all.

446
00:57:31,316 --> 00:57:33,705
What, your kidding right?

447
00:57:33,876 --> 00:57:36,674
Henry, he knows he has to deal with this.

448
00:57:36,756 --> 00:57:39,828
Then he has to deal with this on his
own. I'm done it's over.

449
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:41,315
You have to help him, he's my father,

450
00:57:41,396 --> 00:57:44,752
If you don't help him the IRS
they'll take everything, the restaurant.

451
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,270
No way.

452
00:57:56,676 --> 00:57:58,906
What took you so damn long?

453
00:57:58,996 --> 00:58:01,226
You've been doing this for an hour.

454
00:58:01,316 --> 00:58:03,034
Why are you doing it so small for.

455
00:58:03,116 --> 00:58:09,749
Pat! It's his first day
stop nagging, show him.

456
00:58:09,836 --> 00:58:11,827
Come here, come here.
Get off my sight!

457
00:58:11,916 --> 00:58:14,749
Just go take care of the garbage.

458
00:58:30,876 --> 00:58:34,073
Hi! Pearl.

459
00:58:34,356 --> 00:58:38,952
Have you eaten yet?
I can cook you something.

460
00:58:39,036 --> 00:58:43,951
No, thanks. This is your paper work,
keep it good because...

461
00:58:44,036 --> 00:58:45,913
You gonna need.

462
00:58:45,996 --> 00:58:48,590
I'm sorry, don't be mad at me.

463
00:58:48,676 --> 00:58:52,305
I was wasted you and Henry's time.

464
00:58:52,396 --> 00:58:55,752
Try some other's way.

465
00:58:55,836 --> 00:59:00,546
Up to you dad, because I've done my part.

466
00:59:05,956 --> 00:59:08,186
Here? What's that guy doing?

467
00:59:08,276 --> 00:59:09,675
I hire him to help me here.

468
00:59:09,756 --> 00:59:15,035
He said he used to work
in a restaurant before.

469
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:18,389
Has he got a work permit?

470
00:59:18,476 --> 00:59:20,114
How are you gonna pay for him?

471
00:59:20,196 --> 00:59:23,871
Come on, he's that just like us.

472
00:59:23,956 --> 00:59:25,071
How can you do this?

473
00:59:25,156 --> 00:59:28,785
You already got a problem with IRS
Want more problem with then?

474
00:59:28,876 --> 00:59:34,587
Up to you, you know it's against the laws.

475
00:59:34,756 --> 00:59:38,112
I don't know. Up to you.

476
01:00:00,276 --> 01:00:03,154
Hey gorgeous, haven't see for ages.

477
01:00:03,276 --> 01:00:05,073
What do you want,

478
01:00:05,156 --> 01:00:08,228
better yet get the fuck out.

479
01:00:08,316 --> 01:00:10,352
Relax I ain't here to eat.

480
01:00:10,436 --> 01:00:14,349
If your not here to eat
how can I help you?

481
01:00:14,436 --> 01:00:15,949
You can't help me.

482
01:00:16,036 --> 01:00:18,994
Yo, Pat let's go, dog.

483
01:00:21,196 --> 01:00:25,235
Look at your ass -
you know K. Cs' been asking about you.

484
01:00:25,316 --> 01:00:27,955
She's over at the pad
with the other girls.

485
01:00:28,036 --> 01:00:29,594
Hey man, let's just be out then.

486
01:00:29,676 --> 01:00:31,746
Pat get back here.

487
01:00:31,996 --> 01:00:34,556
Listen to dad, Pat.

488
01:00:36,036 --> 01:00:37,151
I say we be out, dog.

489
01:00:37,236 --> 01:00:39,431
What the fuck you looking

490
01:00:39,516 --> 01:00:43,111
Yo, fuck him man, he's just a fucking
F.O.B. Let's just be out.

491
01:00:43,236 --> 01:00:46,034
Who the hell are you?

492
01:00:46,116 --> 01:00:47,629
Yo, I say we be out, dog.

493
01:00:47,716 --> 01:00:50,947
Don't be a stranger, give me a call.

494
01:00:53,596 --> 01:00:59,387
See? That's why I need help
from a new guy.

495
01:01:06,876 --> 01:01:09,390
You like that, baby?

496
01:01:11,556 --> 01:01:14,116
Bitches, out.

497
01:01:18,756 --> 01:01:20,269
Out!

498
01:01:20,516 --> 01:01:24,145
Fuck, what's your problem?

499
01:01:25,996 --> 01:01:31,866
I'll be waiting in the bed room
there's a Jacuzzi in there to.

500
01:01:34,156 --> 01:01:36,226
Out!

501
01:01:36,876 --> 01:01:39,390
Asshole!

502
01:01:44,276 --> 01:01:45,550
Are you ready, dog?

503
01:01:45,636 --> 01:01:49,311
I was fucking ready man.
Why you gotta cut me off like that?

504
01:01:49,396 --> 01:01:50,795
I'm not talking about that fucking whore...

505
01:01:50,876 --> 01:01:53,026
that you think is your girlfriend, dog.

506
01:01:53,116 --> 01:01:57,394
I'm talking about you ready to walk
with me for tomorrow?

507
01:01:57,956 --> 01:01:59,548
What you got in mind?

508
01:01:59,636 --> 01:02:01,627
That Motherfucker Jules...

509
01:02:01,716 --> 01:02:04,708
he should never have disrespected
me like that.

510
01:02:04,796 --> 01:02:08,152
I made that Motherfucker way
too much money, man.

511
01:02:08,236 --> 01:02:10,033
Yo, man.

512
01:02:10,116 --> 01:02:13,347
Stick with that Motherfucker
and this is as good as it gets.

513
01:02:13,436 --> 01:02:15,711
While it's not good enough.

514
01:02:15,796 --> 01:02:17,434
I hear you, man.

515
01:02:17,516 --> 01:02:22,465
It's time for a change
for tomorrow, yo.

516
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:28,665
Hey, I'm waiting.

517
01:02:32,676 --> 01:02:38,148
Go fuck your whore, dog
and not a word of this.

518
01:03:14,676 --> 01:03:15,870
What?

519
01:03:15,956 --> 01:03:20,472
Nothing.

520
01:03:24,996 --> 01:03:28,033
You don't know how beautiful you are...

521
01:03:29,196 --> 01:03:31,073
That's sweet.

522
01:03:31,156 --> 01:03:35,547
But you know I'm paid
for so don't waste your breath.

523
01:03:35,636 --> 01:03:37,547
Paid for.

524
01:03:38,596 --> 01:03:43,716
Baby I ruined Goldie's surprise, didn't I?

525
01:03:43,796 --> 01:03:47,869
But, but I thought
he said you were asking for me.

526
01:03:47,956 --> 01:03:54,987
I was baby, I was I told him I wasn't
going to come if you weren't here.

527
01:03:55,076 --> 01:03:57,192
But he paid for you...

528
01:03:57,276 --> 01:03:59,267
how much do you get
for an afternoon pool party?

529
01:03:59,356 --> 01:04:02,871
Fuck you,
you don't pay my rent Motherfucker.

530
01:04:02,956 --> 01:04:05,709
K.C., I didn't mean like that.

531
01:04:05,876 --> 01:04:08,470
Nobody takes care of me.

532
01:04:08,996 --> 01:04:10,748
I want to take care of you.

533
01:04:10,836 --> 01:04:13,873
You still ain't paid me
for the two times I been with you...

534
01:04:13,956 --> 01:04:18,746
and now you want to take care of me -
please.

535
01:04:18,916 --> 01:04:21,271
Just tell me how much I need.

536
01:04:21,516 --> 01:04:23,313
You can't afford me.

537
01:04:23,396 --> 01:04:26,194
But I'll be real soon.

538
01:04:26,276 --> 01:04:29,791
Yo, what you got in mind, baby?

539
01:04:29,876 --> 01:04:32,674

540
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:11,054
Pat Thai, please.
Yes, sir.

541
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:15,051
What would you like to have, sir?
Number 33.

542
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:24,775
What can I get you?

543
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:26,339
Have you seen my dad?

544
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:28,490
He's on his way.

545
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:31,413
Excuse me, can we order now?

546
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,697
Let me take care of this.

547
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:39,052
I'll be right back. Sorry.

548
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,255
You lies to my dad...

549
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,617
that you worked in a restaurant before.

550
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:07,012
I can tell by the way you work
that you never done it before.

551
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,455
Why did you work here?

552
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:12,976
It seems your dad need here.

553
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:18,693
I don't get it.
I've been trying to help him.

554
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:22,455
But he's never seen my thought.

555
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:26,968
Maybe your dad need other kind of help.

556
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,334
Pearl, isn't it?

557
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:50,571
I thought... l'd like to move back
to our house for a little while.

558
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,819
Just saw a smile from your dad today.

559
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:18,538
Why do you always stick
you nose on somebody else business.

560
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:21,893
Seem like your dad must love you a lot.

561
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:24,694
Yeah, he loved me.

562
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,572
But it's hard to stay under.

563
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:32,178
Because he always say being Thai,
you have to be a certain way.

564
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:32,976
Specially the lady.

565
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:36,575
Being Thai lady couldn't do this,
couldn't do that anything!

566
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:39,697
But why doesn't he took the fact if us
being in America.

567
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:44,695
American are so much lay back.

568
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:49,532
That's the Thai Traditional.

569
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:56,014
Anyone who understands
would be proud of being Thai.

570
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:03,412
So why are you here?

571
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:09,458
If I have a choice, I wouldn't be here.

572
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:12,532
How about your family,
don't you miss them?

573
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:15,180
They're so far away form you.

574
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:24,610
I'm not that far away from them.

575
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:30,377
I'm done for a day. I gotta go.

576
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:49,370
Man, what are you doing with my bike?

577
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:53,817
I said what are you doing with my bike?

578
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,095
Kick his ass.

579
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:45,374
So did you really think that shit
wasn't going to change that.

580
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:49,135
I would be busted my ass out on
the streets making you money?

581
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:55,250
Shit you got off to a good start G,
but you ain't gonna finish.

582
01:11:55,340 --> 01:12:01,688
Time is up - you through -
It's my world now, dog.

583
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:06,208
What do you think, man?

584
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:09,892
What don't you just shoot him
in the head?

585
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:12,494
Motherfucker's always getting
shoot in the head.

586
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,372
It's to easy, man...

587
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,895
see if I'm gonna shoot a Motherfucker...

588
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:19,016
I want to see him die.

589
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:25,130
See you shoot a Motherfucker
in the head til he's dead,

590
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,296
he didn't fell it.

591
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:31,931
I'm going to hell, dog
there's no doubt in my mind,

592
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:38,493
so when I kill Jules ass,
I want to see that Motherfucker suffer.

593
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:42,493
I been making that Motherfucker
money for years.

594
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:46,255
Now that Motherfucker gonna jack
prices up on me.

595
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:50,617
That's the last straw.

596
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:52,578
You know what we gotta do.

597
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:53,979
Yo man, I got it.

598
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,779

Motherfuckers in the head man.

605
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,370

01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:40,298
Got a problem with my brother?

643
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,857
What is F.O.B.?

644
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:48,295

645
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:51,417
F.O.B. Is Fresh on the boat

646
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:55,618
The refugee that just off the boat.

So, what the problem with Pat?

648
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:05,618
Nothing, just his friend

649
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,018
Gol-d?

650
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:12,979
Not him, maybe some other boys.

651
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:15,415
They're all in the same gang.

652
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:19,971
I'm warning you, stay away from him!

653
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:22,779
You seems to hate that man.

654
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,737
How do you know?

655
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:27,573
I could tell by the way you look at him.

656
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:29,099
Doesn't your brother know.

657
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:33,014
Of course, he doesn't care.

658
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:37,252
He doesn't even know that Gol-d used him.

659
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:49,892
Opp...

660
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:03,936
Dindan... Dan.

661
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:09,490
What's wrong?

662
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:11,977
Must be him.

663
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,415
Must be who?

664
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:27,615
She was 9- month- pregnancy...

665
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:34,572
When officer Dindan's wife was killed
got murder in her own home.

666
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,175
The killer was never found.

667
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:41,091
To investigated...

668
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:45,731
And discovered the killer
Chan the drug lord.

669
01:17:54,380 --> 01:18:03,618
The investigation took 4 years.

670
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:14,173
Dan is that officer.

671
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:46,979
The fuck'en place is empty, dog.

672
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:50,528
Yo, I thought you said me was going
to be here.

673
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,498
Probably sent him to the Restaurant man.

674
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:00,179
Yo, Jack!
What's up?

675
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:03,252
Charlie's line can't understand.

676
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:33,291
Ah, pretty.

677
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:34,970
Motherfucker.

678
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:38,973
Fucker - you'd better know your fucking role,

679
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:42,291
cause Goldie ain't here
and your fresh out of friends.

680
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:45,969
You better quit this shit Charlie,
you're going to get hurt.

681
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:50,258
Yo, Charlie we ain't got time for this shit.

682
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,330
Next time.

683
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:46,936
Oh baby, Oh.

684
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:19,370
Like that uh, that kid didn't never
make you feel that good right.

685
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:23,931
Never honey, not even close.

686
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:27,132
So his little ass told
you whom he loved you, uh.

687
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:29,973
Man when you told him
your plan with Jules,

688
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:32,972
he thought he was going
to take over the world.

689
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:36,973
Little Motherfuckers almost
as ambitious as I am.

690
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:41,577
Shit, but not as fucking ruthless.

691
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:45,968
So you sure it's only going to be Tommy's
ass there that day?

692
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:49,097
Ya, as far as I know.

693
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:51,375
What the fuck you mean
as far as I know,

694
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:53,496
is he going to be the only
Motherfucker there or not?

695
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:58,176
Yes, yes -
It's collection day that day -

696
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:00,728
all the other guys
are out collecting payments.

697
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:04,017
It's the same thing every month.

698
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:12,490
Hey, you know I love you,
you crazy bitch, right?

699
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:16,893
I love you too.

700
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:32,974
I love this time of the day.

701
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:37,258
The sunset makes me calm
and be myself again.

702
01:22:37,340 --> 01:22:40,696
Then it was Pat and Ploy.

703
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:45,734
You know about my past.

704
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:49,652
I just found out a few days ago.

705
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:53,378
I know every thing ever
since I met your dad.

706
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:55,178
My dad is a good man.

707
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:57,854
He's not like uncle Chan.

708
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:01,615
We never got to meet uncle Chan.

709
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:05,579
The only one who's like uncle Chan is Pat.

710
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:06,934
Pat, why did you do that for?

711
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:07,577
What?

712
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:10,128
I saw you Pat, I saw you driving away.

713
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:11,175
I ain't got time for this.

714
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:13,854
Were you going to kill Dan
is that why you were up there?

715
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:16,295
Pat you don't even know uncle Chan.

716
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:19,133
What about uncle Chan?

717
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:22,895
Dan was the one who killed him -
he was an old police in Thailand.

718
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:25,050
What, how do you know this?

719
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:27,813
Isn't that, Isn't that
why you where up there?

720
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:29,538
Look Dan fucked up some of my friends...

721
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:32,976
and he had it coming
that's why we broke into his apartment.

722
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,933
How, how do you know
he killed uncle Chan?

723
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:38,057
Ploy tells me.

724
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:41,337
I think Pat's like that...

725
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:44,378
Because the people
that he hang out with.

726
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:49,534
I try to warn him about Gol-d.

727
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:56,978
Yeah, that guy just
like your uncle Chan.

728
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:04,694
By the time I found out it was too late.

729
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:23,977
I made a wrong decision.
By going out with him.

730
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:32,137
I was a fool for believing him.

731
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:36,170
And one day I saw the real him.

732
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:40,973
I try to fight him.

733
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:46,258
I never told anymore before.

734
01:24:57,380 --> 01:25:00,656
I want each man
at the corner of the house.

735
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:04,176
Two out front is that fucking, you clear that?

736
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:06,216
Yo, what's up dog,

739
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:13,738
What the fucks going on here, man?

740
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:18,735
Goldie, I need you to take care
of someone for me.

741
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:22,051
Yo, you know I don't be trying
to fuck around like that no more.

742
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:24,495
Goldie but this is different...

743
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:27,731

744
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:31,051
he's the cop
who killed your uncle in Thailand.

745
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:33,131
Son of a Bitch!

746
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:34,209
How long have you known this?

747
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:38,851
Just found out - why do you think
I have all these men here.

748
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:40,532
He's just one Motherfucker though, yo.

749
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:45,410
Goldie, this guy's
way to fucking dangerous,

750
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:48,014
that's why I need you to do this.

751
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,818
I'll take care of this.

752
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,128

Yo, Pat comes over here.

759
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:43,538
Looks like they don't
wish you a Happy Thai New Year, yo.

01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:45,417

761
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:46,933

770
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:58,173

771
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:01,697

Hey, Jules thought shit wasn't never

01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:15,011
Thought, I'd be busting my ass

825
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:18,695

Of course, I feel bad for what I did.

873
01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:25,653
I killed the person
and there's no excuse for that.

874
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:32,176
But I did what I had to do
to protect my family.

875
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:36,459
They understand that.

876
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:46,649
My brother wasn't a bad person.
He just made bad decisions.

877
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:50,335
He wanted to help my father
with his tax problem...

878
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:54,891
and he did it the only way
he thought he could.

879
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:59,615
Everybody said they didn't see anything.

880
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:04,058
No one would step up
and testify against me.

881
01:44:04,420 --> 01:44:08,299
And everybody's fingerprints on the gun,

882
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:12,373
the police couldn't find
a case against me.

883
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:21,609
We have to look out for each other
in these crazy streets.

884
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:27,619
We're family.

885
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:34,858
Even Dan

886
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:14,414
Dan says: You stole my vest

887
01:45:14,980 --> 01:45:16,379
Dan saved my brother...

888
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:19,532
even though my uncle
caused him harm.

889
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:22,737
We are so grateful to him

890
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:28,096
Although the doctor's say
that Pat will never be able to walk again

891
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:31,331
At least he's still alive.

892
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:36,818
My father's problem with the IRS
turned out to be a mistake...

893
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:39,892
and the case eventually dismissed.

894
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:42,818
It was such a relief.

895
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:48,694
All of us Thai people living
in Los Angeles

896
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:51,499
We're all out here trying to survive.

897
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:53,571
Trying to make a living.

898
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:56,458
Trying to hang on to our roots.

899
01:45:56,540 --> 01:46:00,089
Those are the thing
we have to hold on too

900
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:03,252
Because that's all we have.

901
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:10,529
I've already been in here for
the past three months and now.

902
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:14,729
I'm finally going home.
