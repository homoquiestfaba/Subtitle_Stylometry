1
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:53,496
In my planet,
the women are barren.

2
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:57,927
I traveled secretly...

3
00:00:58,136 --> 00:01:01,469
across the depths of space,
assuming human form...

4
00:01:03,742 --> 00:01:06,870
so I'd may came to know
earthly women...

5
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,639
and repopulate
my desolated planet.

6
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:16,185
I wish for you to know
my true name. Xunobulax.

7
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:18,880
Xunobulax?

8
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,821
Our race makes love just once.

9
00:01:25,364 --> 00:01:30,392
We put all our cosmic energy
into that one explosive... act...

10
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:34,263
and then,
like your terrestrial mayfly...

11
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,504
we die of a sweet
early content.

12
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:41,978
I want to make love to you
in the manner of my people.

13
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:45,950
I want it to be my last act.

14
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:48,811
Keep that up and it will be
your last act.

15
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:52,816
- I have to accomplish my mission.
- I said stop.

16
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:02,659
- I want my first time to be with you.
- And so do I.

17
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:06,429
Cool, I understand.
Please, Stacy.

18
00:02:29,628 --> 00:02:31,323
What the fuck is this?

19
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:38,358
Hold on.

20
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:45,201
Ben!
Get your ass over here!

21
00:02:46,778 --> 00:02:48,837
Mark, is that you in there?

22
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:59,887
This isn't funny!

23
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:02,458
What the hell...

24
00:03:04,663 --> 00:03:06,130
Rod!

25
00:03:35,293 --> 00:03:37,318
Stacy.

26
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:46,663
Stacy!

27
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:54,702
Stacy!

28
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:07,885
No! Rod!

29
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,650
Oh, my God!

30
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,732
I was supposed to be home
15 minutes ago.

31
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:53,928
Sixth graders can stay out
later than you can.

32
00:05:10,322 --> 00:05:11,880
Stop!

33
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:15,020
Doesn't it ever bother you
you could die a virgin?

34
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:19,391
It 's right up there
with global warming.

35
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:30,165
- We should see other people.
- What?

36
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:35,741
We've been dating for about a year,
and I don't think it 's working out.

37
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:37,812
All right?

38
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:47,088
- Hi, Mrs. Marken.
- You two having fun?

39
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:49,122
Hi, mom.

40
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:52,257
Kenny, you'd happen
to have a cigarette for me?

41
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:55,696
Sure.

42
00:05:58,036 --> 00:06:02,234
Mrs. Marken,
smoking is really bad for you.

43
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:06,836
The industrial strength.

44
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:11,982
I owe you.

45
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,782
I'll have to smoke this here.

46
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:17,386
Brent doesn't like me
to smoke in the house.

47
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:23,021
- It 's my last guilty pleasure.
- Is daddy still up?

48
00:06:23,895 --> 00:06:27,626
- You were out late tonight.
- Kenny was just leaving.

49
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:29,628
Too bad.

50
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:36,872
It looks like the coast is clear.

51
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:39,407
If you want to beat the heat,
you better hurry up.

52
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:43,113
Mrs. Marken?

53
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,677
- Your headlights are on.
- Very observant.

54
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,911
Thanks.
Good night.

55
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:04,401
So, is this goodbye
or good night?

56
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,870
Pick one.

57
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:10,139
- Pick one.
- I think it 's up to you.

58
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:22,310
Don't... slam the door.

59
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:40,600
Like a little tiny mouse.

60
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,733
Good night.

61
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:17,038
- Do you know what time it is?
- Don't scare me like that.

62
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:19,233
You're grounded the next two
Friday nights.

63
00:08:19,444 --> 00:08:23,676
- Most 6th graders stay out later.
- They're not the sheriff's daughter.

64
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:48,899
Marken.

65
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:55,306
I'll get down there
as soon as I can.

66
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:13,824
Daddy.

67
00:09:43,194 --> 00:09:46,095
- You're the only one here?
- First on the scene.

68
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:49,027
The forensics and Homicide
are on their way.

69
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:52,635
That 's the victim's car.
It 's covered in blood.

70
00:09:56,407 --> 00:10:00,400
Over here, I found the boy
faced down in the water...

71
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:03,645
with about a million stab wounds.
And the girl...

72
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,510
nailed to a tree.

73
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:11,385
A lot of blood pumped out of
her wounds, which means...

74
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:15,491
Which means all this was done
while she was still alive.

75
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:43,951
I'm trying to pump out a special
edition of the paper before lunch.

76
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:47,056
It you tell me all that you know,
I'll be your best friend...

77
00:10:47,258 --> 00:10:52,195
and you can be co-editor of the
paper, what do you think?

78
00:10:52,397 --> 00:10:57,494
Don't be silent like that. Talk to
your daddy and snoop dog for me.

79
00:10:57,735 --> 00:11:00,761
I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

80
00:11:00,972 --> 00:11:02,837
You haven't heard about
Rod e Stacy?

81
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,067
Are you taking fun notes for
your pathetic gossip column?

82
00:11:06,277 --> 00:11:10,270
- Did they break up?
- Break up? Wake up, they're dead!

83
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:14,679
They shuffled up the mortal coil,
they went to see their maker.

84
00:11:14,886 --> 00:11:17,753
How can you be so
critically uninformed?

85
00:11:17,956 --> 00:11:20,652
Look, the whole school is
buzzing with that music.

86
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:30,025
Look! Maybe there's something for
my pathetic gossip column after all.

87
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:33,596
Like I'm not paying attention.

88
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,001
Mr. Sisler, sheriff Marken is here.
Shall I bring him in?

89
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:43,541
Thank you, Diana.

90
00:11:48,786 --> 00:11:52,244
- It 's been a while, Brent.
- Tom!

91
00:11:59,097 --> 00:12:01,531
I don't need to tell you what
an uproar the school is in.

92
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,261
I canceled all the
regular classes...

93
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:07,902
and asked the teachers to
counsel and console the kids.

94
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:11,906
I know there are professionals
for this sort of situation...

95
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,170
...but I thought it 'd be best...
- I'll have to stop by some classes.

96
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:19,712
Ask a few questions.

97
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:22,546
I would like to start with the ones
those two kids attended.

98
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:25,651
Naturally, you're
all horrified...

99
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,825
by the sudden senseless loss
of your classmates.

100
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:33,693
Perhaps some of you feel guilty
that you weren't nicer to them...

101
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:36,230
or maybe you're...

102
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:39,528
haunted by something unpleasant
you might have said to one of them.

103
00:12:40,338 --> 00:12:44,001
Once, in the 8th grade,
I had a fight with Rod...

104
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,507
I told him to fuck off and die!

105
00:12:53,284 --> 00:12:54,512
Come on, guys.

106
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:58,386
It 's alright, Heather.

107
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:05,855
Maybe we'll all feel better if we
talk about them and how we feel.

108
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:11,094
Mark, you were friends with Rod.
Do you want to say something?

109
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:15,238
Oh, man...

110
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,738
I don't know, I'm just...

111
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:21,912
Thank you.

112
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:27,811
How about you, Sandy?

113
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:36,984
I guess at times like this...

114
00:13:37,462 --> 00:13:40,920
...I just hope there is a heaven.
- Lame.

115
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,497
Cindy, come on!

116
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:47,695
It 's important in times like this
we offer each other some support.

117
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:51,898
I'd like to offer the killer some
support in the electric chair.

118
00:13:54,979 --> 00:14:00,144
It 's alright, but the means of
execution is by lethal injection.

119
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:05,548
Ben, I know you have a different
point of view regarding the tragedy.

120
00:14:08,493 --> 00:14:09,653
Go head.

121
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:13,727
I'd like to know whether
this killer...

122
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:18,561
removed any body parts, or sexually
defiled any orifice of the victims.

123
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,135
You're sick.

124
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:25,301
I wanna know, because if he didn't,
I think he deserves thumbs down.

125
00:14:25,676 --> 00:14:29,442
- How can you be so insensitive?
- And you are Mother Teresa?

126
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:34,141
- You told him to drop dead.
- You're fooling yourself with this.

127
00:14:34,352 --> 00:14:37,685
Jackass, you're not playing
Death quake, this is the real world.

128
00:14:37,955 --> 00:14:39,252
Fuck you.

129
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:43,891
It 's Ben's pathetic concept of cool,
just to pretend he's not afraid.

130
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:47,997
Hello Cindy Freud.
What 's your concept of cool?

131
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:50,928
Bang the entire senior class
starting with "A"?

132
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,468
If I'm what you just said, why do
you try to hook me up nonstop?

133
00:14:54,672 --> 00:14:58,972
- I find the experience attractive.
- Shut up now, would you please?

134
00:14:59,177 --> 00:15:01,145
Everyone!

135
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:03,810
What 's wrong with you people?

136
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:06,777
Jody...

137
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:11,546
certainly I can count on you to say
something singularly constructive.

138
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:15,720
Dad?

139
00:15:16,027 --> 00:15:18,962
Please, excuse the intrusion,
Mr. Marliston...

140
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:21,393
but sheriff Marken would like
to address the class.

141
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:26,195
- It 's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Likewise.

142
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:30,305
Class, please give your attention
to sheriff Marken.

143
00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:34,372
Two of your fellow students,
Rod Harper and Stacy Twelfmann...

144
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:36,479
were murdered
last night at the falls...

145
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:39,239
by a person or persons unknown,
in a cold-blooded fashion.

146
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:45,015
The reason I came here was to ask
you, as friends and good citizens...

147
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:46,485
to come forward to me
or my staff...

148
00:15:46,824 --> 00:15:49,884
with any information you might have
concerning this terrible crime.

149
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:53,420
- Is there a suspect yet?
- No.

150
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:58,898
- Is there any other information?
- I can't discuss the case.

151
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:05,432
Plato says, policy can only remain
healthy if truth is available to all.

152
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:12,041
Plato can give all details he wants
when he's the sheriff of this town.

153
00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:16,886
He's doing it deliberately.

154
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:19,789
Of course he is.

155
00:16:19,991 --> 00:16:22,323
All the more reason why
you should ignore it.

156
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,428
Do you think she goes
all the way?

157
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,759
I doubt it.
Who'd want to fuck her?

158
00:16:36,307 --> 00:16:38,207
Look.

159
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:56,220
Shit.

160
00:16:56,494 --> 00:16:58,860
Stop throwing shit!

161
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:06,535
I'm done with relationships...

162
00:17:06,904 --> 00:17:09,532
but I see a hope for you.
Come on.

163
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,765
- No, Jody.
- Come on.

164
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:15,377
You watch him eat every single day
and you never talk to him.

165
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,014
My parents have been married for
25 years and they do the same.

166
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:21,184
You're going to go.
You don't want to make a scene!

167
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,084
How are you doing?

168
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:38,729
- It 's a pretty freaky day today.
- I guess so.

169
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:51,675
Shit sucking liar!

170
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:55,344
I'm gonna kill you!

171
00:17:55,786 --> 00:17:57,617
Better than a cock-sucking liar!

172
00:17:57,822 --> 00:17:59,483
I'll kill you.

173
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:03,787
What 's going on here?

174
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:11,164
It 's a compliment when a guy
says you can suck good dick.

175
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:15,405
You got something
on your mouth there.

176
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:19,204
- He's lying to everyone about me.
- Tell me about it in the office.

177
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:22,011
Leave your phone number.

178
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,005
It wasn't me.

179
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:31,378
- What 's up with that?
- He's saying she gave him a hammer.

180
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:34,553
- Did she?
- Are you kidding?

181
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:41,588
She thinks fellatio is Shakespeare's
character. She never saw a dick.

182
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:45,764
That 's funny.

183
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:48,362
What do you think, Mark?

184
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:53,204
I think these ribs rule.

185
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:17,226
Come on, honey, we're late.

186
00:19:17,702 --> 00:19:19,932
Hi, handsome.

187
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,784
Here we go.

188
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:43,991
It 's good to see you!

189
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:51,257
Who is it?

190
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:53,636
Annette?

191
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:58,366
- It 's Loralee Sherman.
- Excuse me?

192
00:19:58,576 --> 00:20:00,635
Loralee Sherman.

193
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:02,710
Is your mom home?

194
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:08,274
She didn't tell you
I was coming by?

195
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,884
I must have just missed her.
Can I leave a note?

196
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:24,124
Just one second.

197
00:20:28,272 --> 00:20:30,570
Could you slip it through
the door, please?

198
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:51,523
I think I'm ready for the run.

199
00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:54,791
What 's the hurry for?

200
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:58,426
Slow down.

201
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,666
- Who left the door open?
- I don't know.

202
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:08,879
Annette?

203
00:21:21,392 --> 00:21:24,555
Grab there, grab underneath.
Get a good grip.

204
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:28,596
Step through, let their weight and
their momentum take them over.

205
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,325
The most important thing
is this grip. Like a pitbull.

206
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,200
Is there any way you could give me
a ray gun, stun gun, anything?

207
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,377
It 's against the law.
Here I come.

208
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:46,281
Take 5, champ.

209
00:21:48,085 --> 00:21:49,916
Marken.

210
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:03,096
Looks like we have
an encore performer.

211
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:08,328
Agent Bronhill, this is
special agent Majestik.

212
00:22:09,006 --> 00:22:11,634
- Who was first on the scene?
- My deputy.

213
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:18,238
I responded to the father's call
11:OO pm, then I called the sheriff.

214
00:22:20,517 --> 00:22:22,417
I'll get this.

215
00:22:31,195 --> 00:22:33,720
We're in the big league now.

216
00:22:38,502 --> 00:22:41,938
As you can see on the inside left thigh
there's a one inch deep carving...

217
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:43,902
of the word "virgin".

218
00:22:44,108 --> 00:22:46,440
Also found in all 3 victims.

219
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:48,603
Like Stacy Twelfmann...

220
00:22:48,812 --> 00:22:52,373
Annette was in fact a virgin
at the time of death.

221
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:56,542
The hymen was intact. We found no
evidence of semen on the clothes...

222
00:22:56,754 --> 00:23:00,281
skin, hair, mouth, or the anus.

223
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:04,225
No abrasions or contusions
in the pubic region.

224
00:23:04,428 --> 00:23:08,125
In fact no evidence of
sexual penetration of any kind.

225
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:13,228
Neither was the boy we found in the
first killings sexually assaulted.

226
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,906
Of course I can't tell you if
he died a virgin...

227
00:23:17,174 --> 00:23:21,804
but I can tell you that he had no
sex at the time of the killings.

228
00:23:22,546 --> 00:23:24,343
It would appear...

229
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:29,315
that your killer has been accurate
in the application of his signature.

230
00:23:39,196 --> 00:23:41,027
Come in.

231
00:23:45,002 --> 00:23:46,833
Hi, honey.

232
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:48,664
Hi, daddy.

233
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:50,601
Listen...

234
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:53,399
I need to ask you
a personal question.

235
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:57,569
- About what?
- About you and Kenny.

236
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:02,410
- What is it?
- How far you've gone?

237
00:24:03,554 --> 00:24:04,885
Gone?

238
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:07,786
Gone, you know...

239
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,990
base wise.

240
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:12,888
Are you two kissing?

241
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,598
Of course.

242
00:24:17,234 --> 00:24:20,203
I'm not a child anymore, dad.
That 's normal.

243
00:24:20,404 --> 00:24:24,465
- I'm not criticizing.
- I know.

244
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:27,943
Have you gone further than that?

245
00:24:30,547 --> 00:24:36,042
I wouldn't ask you this unless
it was absolutely necessary.

246
00:24:37,755 --> 00:24:41,589
Can you go further...
than you have?

247
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,625
Yes.

248
00:24:48,065 --> 00:24:51,501
But you don't have
to worry about it.

249
00:24:53,537 --> 00:24:56,665
We just broke up the other day.

250
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:04,836
Are you disappointed, dad?

251
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,150
Are you disappointed
that I'm still a virgin?

252
00:25:09,953 --> 00:25:13,582
Not at all.

253
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:21,996
I'm very, very proud of you.

254
00:25:26,537 --> 00:25:28,903
You're still my little girl.

255
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:35,743
Good night.
I love you.

256
00:25:46,824 --> 00:25:49,918
Parents in our town need to know
what 's going on here.

257
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,560
Does that mean revealing
the signature?

258
00:25:52,796 --> 00:25:54,559
I suppose it does.

259
00:25:54,765 --> 00:25:56,426
Textbooks say don't.

260
00:25:56,633 --> 00:25:59,966
It leaves us no conclusive way
to verify the killer's confession.

261
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,333
- It could inspire copycat crimes.
- This is different.

262
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,532
This isn't a signature.
It 's a message.

263
00:26:06,743 --> 00:26:08,404
Message?

264
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,874
Set up an emergency town meeting.
Tonight at 6:OO pm.

265
00:26:15,085 --> 00:26:19,215
I want every parent of every
teenager in town there. Do it.

266
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:23,685
We don't have a venue
big enough for that.

267
00:26:23,894 --> 00:26:26,055
We'll use the gym
at the high school.

268
00:26:26,697 --> 00:26:29,461
No kids.
Not yet.

269
00:26:31,902 --> 00:26:34,530
There you are, Mr. Marliston.

270
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,244
I finished my T. S. Elliot paper.

271
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:44,311
Great.

272
00:26:45,682 --> 00:26:49,584
- I really love his work.
- Good.

273
00:26:52,756 --> 00:26:57,193
"Less our dried voices
When we whisper together

274
00:26:58,362 --> 00:27:01,923
Are quite and meaningless
As wind and dry grass

275
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,628
Or rats feeding of broken glass
In our dry cellar"

276
00:27:16,547 --> 00:27:21,507
Do you think that that 's how it is
between people, Mr. Marliston?

277
00:27:22,286 --> 00:27:24,754
Everything dry...

278
00:27:24,988 --> 00:27:28,185
and meaningless
and hopelessly empty?

279
00:27:32,095 --> 00:27:34,029
I heard that you broke up
with Kenny.

280
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:39,700
What does that have to do with it?
I'm very over him.

281
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,361
Do you think that any serious
thought that I have...

282
00:27:42,573 --> 00:27:45,838
is solely attributed to my one
misspent year with Kenny?

283
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:48,876
No, I'm sorry.

284
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:58,280
I'm sorry. I'm very embarrassed
that I just yelled at you.

285
00:27:58,522 --> 00:28:01,685
I'm really sorry,
it 's none of my business.

286
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:09,961
What 's wrong?

287
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:13,894
It 's weird. I just saw
someone standing there.

288
00:28:51,008 --> 00:28:52,703
Come out!

289
00:29:25,275 --> 00:29:27,835
- Anything?
- No.

290
00:29:28,412 --> 00:29:31,404
I guess we've spooked each
other pretty good, didn't we?

291
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,476
Come on, I have to go to this
meeting your father organized.

292
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:46,126
Are you gonna be alright?

293
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,421
Mr. Marliston?

294
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,165
Can we talk again sometime?

295
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:55,634
- Of course, Jody.
- I mean just the us.

296
00:30:01,678 --> 00:30:03,578
Sure.

297
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,338
Go home, Jody.

298
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:07,346
Run!

299
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,216
You cannot tell these parents
somebody is murdering virgins.

300
00:30:14,524 --> 00:30:16,651
Maybe Annette would be
alive today...

301
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,385
if I had revealed details
about the first two killings.

302
00:30:19,596 --> 00:30:21,996
Get a hold of yourself.
You've got responsibility.

303
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:24,326
Get your hands of me.

304
00:30:24,534 --> 00:30:29,028
Don't talk to me about it! We know
what it means to walk away from it.

305
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:32,706
If word got back to these kids
that somebody is...

306
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:35,605
murdering virgins, we are
gonna have a goddamn...

307
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:41,648
...fuck festival on our hands.
- It 's better than dead teenagers.

308
00:31:00,137 --> 00:31:02,799
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

309
00:31:03,006 --> 00:31:04,701
- I am getting the scoop.
- Then, get it.

310
00:31:04,908 --> 00:31:07,934
I want to thank you very much
for coming out this evening.

311
00:31:08,378 --> 00:31:10,744
As I'm sure you all know...

312
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:14,340
in the last two days
we've lost 3 of our children.

313
00:31:14,918 --> 00:31:17,887
We've know established the
common link between those killings.

314
00:31:18,121 --> 00:31:19,383
What is it?

315
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:23,524
All 3 victims attended
our public high school...

316
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,059
and all 3 victims,
to the best of our knowledge...

317
00:31:27,564 --> 00:31:29,828
appeared to be... virgins.

318
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:36,100
Holly hymens, Batman!
They're killing virgins!

319
00:31:36,306 --> 00:31:40,072
- You mean it 's more than coincidence?
- Are you close to an arrest?

320
00:31:41,545 --> 00:31:45,675
- What are we going to tell our kids?
- To go out and get laid to be safe?

321
00:31:46,216 --> 00:31:49,743
- I'm not saying that.
- I can't lock my daughter home.

322
00:31:50,153 --> 00:31:53,782
- I wouldn't worry about it, Victor.
- What are you saying about her?

323
00:31:54,057 --> 00:31:55,581
Sit down, I was joking.

324
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:58,283
It 's a hell of a time to be joking
about a thing like this!

325
00:31:58,595 --> 00:31:59,926
Back off!

326
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:08,565
This is totally excellent. They've
turned into a bunch of wild animals!

327
00:32:08,772 --> 00:32:10,262
Get out of the way.

328
00:32:13,677 --> 00:32:18,876
- Battery! Can I use your phone?
- You never turn it back.

329
00:32:19,216 --> 00:32:21,514
Please, remember why
we came here.

330
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:24,583
Just give this to me.

331
00:32:27,424 --> 00:32:29,688
Elway? Stop the presses,
I've got a story for you.

332
00:32:29,893 --> 00:32:32,191
Virgin killer terrorizes...
You're breaking up.

333
00:32:32,395 --> 00:32:35,796
No, not virgin killer...
I have to get our of here.

334
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:39,200
I'm asking you
for the last time.

335
00:32:40,036 --> 00:32:41,731
Alright, that 's enough!

336
00:32:43,406 --> 00:32:44,668
Oh, daddy!

337
00:32:48,678 --> 00:32:50,475
Timmy?

338
00:32:53,383 --> 00:32:55,749
I need my cell phone back.

339
00:33:06,596 --> 00:33:08,188
Shit!

340
00:33:56,313 --> 00:34:00,716
Timmy, come on!
This isn't funny anymore.

341
00:34:01,818 --> 00:34:06,482
I'll be your best friend.
Your very, very, very best friend.

342
00:34:31,114 --> 00:34:33,048
Is that for me?

343
00:35:53,396 --> 00:35:55,023
Virgin.

344
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:58,558
She was after me.
She killed Timmy! She's in there.

345
00:36:58,762 --> 00:37:02,027
- Take her. Stay back!
- Dad, be careful.

346
00:37:33,963 --> 00:37:36,591
Maybe the nose was just
a little bit smaller.

347
00:37:38,835 --> 00:37:41,531
And there was a gray
streak right there.

348
00:37:43,807 --> 00:37:45,172
Like that.

349
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,443
That 's her.

350
00:37:53,516 --> 00:37:55,416
That 's at least what I saw of her.

351
00:37:57,487 --> 00:37:59,011
Can you make her, sheriff?

352
00:38:03,827 --> 00:38:06,022
Listen to me! Listen to me!

353
00:38:06,229 --> 00:38:08,163
- Listen to me!
- Give me the bell.

354
00:38:08,364 --> 00:38:12,164
You stupid FBI sons of bitches,
why don't you come here and get me?

355
00:38:12,368 --> 00:38:16,202
- You did good, baby.
- Listen to me, I killed those kids.

356
00:38:16,472 --> 00:38:18,997
I've got to make
a couple of calls.

357
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:23,441
Your mother will be here in
a couple of minutes. You'll be fine.

358
00:38:25,148 --> 00:38:27,810
- I killed those kids.
- Watch your language.

359
00:38:28,017 --> 00:38:31,180
You're a bunch of sons of bitches!
That 's what you are.

360
00:38:31,554 --> 00:38:34,182
And you know what? I loved
to kill them. They were evil.

361
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,190
I loved to kill them. Do you know
what I did before I killed them?

362
00:38:38,394 --> 00:38:39,793
I kissed them.

363
00:38:39,996 --> 00:38:41,395
Like this!

364
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,359
Rolly is my name!
Don't you hurt me!

365
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:49,501
I know my rights.

366
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:08,184
Brent.

367
00:39:08,691 --> 00:39:10,784
Great meeting last night.

368
00:39:11,194 --> 00:39:13,321
Very comforting to parents.

369
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:15,588
Listen, are you alone?

370
00:39:16,366 --> 00:39:19,699
Good, because I have something
to show you. I'm faxing to you now.

371
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,161
Are you looking at it?
Tell me that's not her.

372
00:39:48,031 --> 00:39:52,161
- Who?
- Loralee Sherman. Isn't it her?

373
00:39:53,403 --> 00:39:56,236
Brent, you are cracking up.

374
00:39:56,472 --> 00:39:59,635
Years ago, I tried to contact her.
I traced here to West Virginia.

375
00:39:59,842 --> 00:40:02,504
About two hours from here.
This time I'm going out there.

376
00:40:02,812 --> 00:40:05,906
Nobody has seen or heard of her
for over 25 years.

377
00:40:06,115 --> 00:40:07,844
Why the hell would she
be showing up now...

378
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:10,178
as some sort of
a psycho killer?

379
00:40:14,357 --> 00:40:16,382
Put the phone down,
I'll call you back.

380
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:20,156
- What are you doing?
- What is wrong?

381
00:40:20,463 --> 00:40:23,489
Were you listening to me?
What did you hear?

382
00:40:23,766 --> 00:40:26,530
I didn't hear anything. I just
picked up the phone to call mom.

383
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:31,006
I couldn't figure out how
to get a line out, that 's all.

384
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,746
Sorry, honey.
This case, I guess...

385
00:40:41,784 --> 00:40:44,116
it 's really getting to me.

386
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,654
Sorry, baby, it 's not your fault.
It 's not your fault.

387
00:40:55,865 --> 00:40:57,696
Hi, sheriff Marken.

388
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,299
Hello, Sandy.

389
00:40:59,502 --> 00:41:02,528
Oh, my God. Are you okay?
Everybody's been asking about you.

390
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:07,540
Sheriff! Rolly, prisoner wants
to make a full confession.

391
00:41:08,611 --> 00:41:11,171
I hope it 's faster than
last week's confession.

392
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:16,313
- You're not gonna believe this.
- What?

393
00:41:16,552 --> 00:41:19,385
Hurricane hormone has hit
the whole entire school.

394
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:22,490
Word got out that your attacker
has this thing for virgins.

395
00:41:22,692 --> 00:41:26,719
Everyone's decided to leave the
endangered species list. Have sex.

396
00:41:26,929 --> 00:41:31,491
- You make it sound like a flu shot.
- We're talking hymen holocaust here.

397
00:41:31,701 --> 00:41:35,068
But they couldn't print the location,
so I'm gonna give you the 411.

398
00:41:36,506 --> 00:41:39,031
- Where is it?
- The old Donkey Hill hunting lodge.

399
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:42,806
That disgusting place?
That place is such a shithole.

400
00:41:43,012 --> 00:41:44,775
All we need is floor space.

401
00:41:44,981 --> 00:41:47,814
Didn't you want your first time to be
something beautiful and romantic?

402
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:51,509
You have to go!
Everybody is gonna be there.

403
00:41:51,721 --> 00:41:53,746
Mark is going, of course.
And Kenny.

404
00:41:55,558 --> 00:41:58,288
And you cannot leave saving his life
up to that slut Sharon.

405
00:41:59,495 --> 00:42:03,261
Cindy is holding her pre-game talk
at the bleacher's at lunch. All girls.

406
00:42:05,701 --> 00:42:09,034
How is my baby?
How is your leg?

407
00:42:11,908 --> 00:42:15,309
Sandy, good to see you.
I'm so happy you're here.

408
00:42:16,045 --> 00:42:18,946
Honey, are you finished yet?
Are you ready to come home?

409
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:23,275
- I was gonna go to school with Sandy.
- I don't think that 's a very good idea.

410
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,151
Why don't you go home
with your mother?

411
00:42:25,922 --> 00:42:29,085
I'd really like to be
with my friends right now.

412
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:31,155
She will be safe with us.

413
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:34,723
It 's okay.
I'll keep an eye on her.

414
00:43:01,357 --> 00:43:02,415
Come on!

415
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:12,389
It 's nice to see you, Jody.
Are you alright?

416
00:43:15,738 --> 00:43:17,706
How did you make it?

417
00:43:29,252 --> 00:43:31,345
I almost lost you.

418
00:43:31,888 --> 00:43:34,220
I couldn't go on living if I had.

419
00:43:34,857 --> 00:43:37,849
- Really?
- Of course.

420
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,255
How about, what 's her face?

421
00:43:41,497 --> 00:43:44,466
Jody, I love you.

422
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,859
But I still have female friends.

423
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:50,735
- But?
- But...

424
00:43:51,574 --> 00:43:55,635
Let 's not fight. Come with me
to this party tonight.

425
00:43:55,978 --> 00:44:00,176
I promised my dad I'd be home after
school and stay there. I promised.

426
00:44:00,816 --> 00:44:04,843
Look, if you don't want
to go with me...

427
00:44:05,054 --> 00:44:09,081
just say so.
Don't use your dad as an excuse.

428
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:11,123
I'm not.

429
00:44:15,731 --> 00:44:17,460
Who is that?

430
00:44:18,334 --> 00:44:21,861
- It 's my bodyguard.
- Bodyguard?

431
00:44:23,272 --> 00:44:25,172
I told my dad I'd be home at 3.

432
00:44:25,741 --> 00:44:29,871
But will you come with me? Come
with me later and we'll go together.

433
00:44:30,112 --> 00:44:31,875
I'll think about it.

434
00:44:48,898 --> 00:44:51,594
Girls have to do everything.

435
00:44:51,801 --> 00:44:53,894
Boys are totally clueless when
it comes to sex.

436
00:44:54,103 --> 00:44:58,267
It starts with them trying to unhook
our bras and it never changes.

437
00:44:59,075 --> 00:45:01,475
Wait until they try to put
their dicks in you.

438
00:45:01,978 --> 00:45:05,379
- Do they need help with that?
- Always.

439
00:45:07,683 --> 00:45:09,776
What about birth control?

440
00:45:09,986 --> 00:45:11,886
Girls, there's no time
for the pill...

441
00:45:12,021 --> 00:45:14,387
and certainly no chance
for withdraw...

442
00:45:14,924 --> 00:45:16,755
so, I recommend condoms.

443
00:45:17,226 --> 00:45:20,593
What about clitoral
or vaginal orgasm?

444
00:45:20,796 --> 00:45:25,028
Unless we're talking about
masturbation, forget it.

445
00:45:28,271 --> 00:45:30,364
Aren't you being just
a little hard on the boys?

446
00:45:32,508 --> 00:45:36,706
Dennis asked me today
if chicks had 2 holes or 3.

447
00:45:36,912 --> 00:45:40,313
- I did not!
- How could you not know that?

448
00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:44,508
I forgot I was hanging
with the experts clan.

449
00:45:46,756 --> 00:45:50,192
I get it that the four kids
are dead, but...

450
00:45:50,393 --> 00:45:53,658
I'm sorry, this is
still a pretty choice.

451
00:45:56,098 --> 00:45:57,861
No shit!

452
00:45:59,435 --> 00:46:02,131
Next thing we have to do,
is find a psycho...

453
00:46:02,371 --> 00:46:05,807
who is after chicks
who don't give head.

454
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:10,438
Then I won't have to worry
about one hole.

455
00:46:11,947 --> 00:46:16,850
This is Stan Michaels, coming to
you live from G. W. High School...

456
00:46:17,253 --> 00:46:19,813
the epicenter of what can only
be described as...

457
00:46:20,022 --> 00:46:23,150
the senseless slaughter of innocence
here in Cherry Falls, Virginia.

458
00:46:23,592 --> 00:46:28,495
In the last 3 days, four teenagers
have been killed, and one attacked.

459
00:46:28,731 --> 00:46:32,030
Certain local officials believe
the killer, still at large...

460
00:46:32,234 --> 00:46:35,601
may be targeting teenage
high school virgins.

461
00:46:35,805 --> 00:46:39,741
And now the students here on campus
have organized a sex party...

462
00:46:39,942 --> 00:46:42,706
to actually eliminate themselves
as possible targets.

463
00:46:43,346 --> 00:46:45,780
Attention, this is your
principal speaking.

464
00:46:46,449 --> 00:46:48,610
It has come to my notice
that certain individuals...

465
00:46:48,818 --> 00:46:52,413
have taken it upon themselves
to organize a wild party tonight.

466
00:46:52,888 --> 00:46:54,412
I want you to know...

467
00:46:54,657 --> 00:46:57,626
that any G.W. student
attending this gap...

468
00:46:57,827 --> 00:47:02,526
will be disadvantaged by every
penalty it 's in my power to impose.

469
00:47:15,978 --> 00:47:19,937
Local school officials don't know
how to handle the situation.

470
00:47:20,149 --> 00:47:22,777
We'll get comments now
from the students...

471
00:47:55,885 --> 00:47:59,753
Virgin High!
Drop your pants to fuck, or die!

472
00:48:14,703 --> 00:48:16,261
Hi, mom.

473
00:48:17,273 --> 00:48:19,138
How's my brave little baby?

474
00:48:19,909 --> 00:48:22,503
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

475
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:27,273
Don't worry, deputy Mina was
watching me like a hawk all day.

476
00:48:27,483 --> 00:48:29,610
Must've been a very
interesting day at school.

477
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:35,345
Definitely, it wasn't
your typical Thursday.

478
00:48:36,892 --> 00:48:39,417
I smell fresh cookies here.

479
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:44,593
These are a little bit burned, but
I've got another batch coming out.

480
00:48:45,968 --> 00:48:49,131
Don't eat this.
Spit it out.

481
00:48:49,338 --> 00:48:52,466
Then let me get you some water
to wash it down.

482
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:57,772
Mom? Do you know anything about
a woman named Loralee Sherman?

483
00:49:02,184 --> 00:49:03,845
No, why?

484
00:49:04,053 --> 00:49:07,489
I overheard daddy talking to
Mr. Sisler and they mentioned her.

485
00:49:08,123 --> 00:49:10,318
I have no idea who
you're talking about.

486
00:49:11,393 --> 00:49:15,523
Mr. Sisler said that she had
disappeared 25 years ago.

487
00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:19,167
Wouldn't a story like that
make small town news?

488
00:49:21,971 --> 00:49:24,667
I've never heard of her,
and I have lived here all my life...

489
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:27,365
except those two years
at Berkeley.

490
00:49:29,979 --> 00:49:34,313
I think you should go lie down,
take a little rest. You look pale.

491
00:49:34,517 --> 00:49:37,509
- I'll call you for dinner.
- I'm wasted.

492
00:49:38,587 --> 00:49:40,646
Okay, sweetheart?

493
00:49:56,939 --> 00:49:58,497
I'm going to West Virginia.

494
00:49:58,874 --> 00:50:01,502
West Virginia?
We need you here.

495
00:50:01,844 --> 00:50:04,039
There's something
I've got to do there.

496
00:50:06,181 --> 00:50:09,844
Okay, I'll hold down the fort.

497
00:50:10,052 --> 00:50:13,112
But we are getting some calls
from some irate parents.

498
00:50:13,355 --> 00:50:16,654
What do you want us to do
about this sex party?

499
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,350
Sex party?
Do you know where it is?

500
00:50:19,962 --> 00:50:21,088
I'll find out.

501
00:50:21,864 --> 00:50:24,389
Treat it like any other party.

502
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,963
If there's trouble, move in.
Otherwise, lay off.

503
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,975
I could be gone a while.

504
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:35,487
- Mom!
- What are you doing here? Go home!

505
00:52:35,698 --> 00:52:39,259
Mom, tell me about
Loralee Sherman. Tell me!

506
00:52:39,468 --> 00:52:41,129
Tell me!

507
00:52:42,905 --> 00:52:45,430
When I was in high school...

508
00:52:45,974 --> 00:52:49,432
there was a girl named
Loralee Sherman...

509
00:52:49,645 --> 00:52:52,637
that claimed she was raped by...

510
00:52:54,116 --> 00:52:56,175
4 drunken seniors.

511
00:52:56,685 --> 00:52:58,414
And?

512
00:53:00,823 --> 00:53:04,816
Nobody was ever
formally charged. Nobody.

513
00:53:08,597 --> 00:53:10,758
Nobody was ever charged.

514
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:13,762
Was there any evidence?

515
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:16,860
Did she identify them?

516
00:53:17,873 --> 00:53:19,602
And why weren't they charged?

517
00:53:20,008 --> 00:53:24,377
Because they were from good
families, stars of the football team.

518
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,845
And she was just this Loner
that nobody cared for.

519
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:31,486
She just thought she was
smarter than everybody.

520
00:53:31,954 --> 00:53:34,081
Nothing would have
ever come from it.

521
00:53:35,124 --> 00:53:38,059
I don't know if it would have
held up in court.

522
00:53:38,794 --> 00:53:41,854
Not then, and I don't think
they would now.

523
00:53:42,364 --> 00:53:45,026
So, you all just let it go?

524
00:53:45,968 --> 00:53:48,528
She left town...

525
00:53:48,904 --> 00:53:51,737
and nobody ever
saw her again.

526
00:53:54,143 --> 00:53:58,671
That was 27 years ago.

527
00:53:59,915 --> 00:54:02,110
Who are the men that raped her?

528
00:54:03,852 --> 00:54:09,848
Well, two of the guys left town
about the year after that.

529
00:54:10,058 --> 00:54:13,892
And that was good, because we
were all able to move forward after.

530
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:17,157
Who else?

531
00:54:18,033 --> 00:54:21,730
- Tommy Sisler.
- The principle.

532
00:54:24,072 --> 00:54:26,802
You said that there were
four men.

533
00:54:27,509 --> 00:54:29,704
Who is the fourth?

534
00:54:32,314 --> 00:54:34,145
Mom?

535
00:54:39,521 --> 00:54:41,318
Who is the fourth, mom?

536
00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:45,793
Mom!

537
00:54:49,131 --> 00:54:53,033
Your father.
Your father.

538
00:54:54,036 --> 00:54:59,975
Honey, he didn't participate. He was
sick, he was falling down drunk.

539
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:04,336
But he went to the police, and
he told them what happened?

540
00:55:05,113 --> 00:55:08,549
Honey, those were his good friends.
He couldn't do that.

541
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:10,911
And besides,
what would he tell police?

542
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:14,384
That a drunken girl had sex
with three drunken boys?

543
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,390
You said it was rape.

544
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:41,188
441O-5 to 45.

545
00:58:46,802 --> 00:58:48,326
45.

546
00:58:48,537 --> 00:58:50,801
What's twenty?

547
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:54,937
I'm heading back now.

548
00:58:55,277 --> 00:58:58,041
Did you find what
you were looking for?

549
00:59:00,582 --> 00:59:03,642
- Sir?
- I don't know.

550
00:59:03,885 --> 00:59:08,413
I've got a message for you to meet
up with Tom Sisler at the school.

551
00:59:09,124 --> 00:59:10,614
Did he say why?

552
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:15,819
Something to do with a Loralee
Sherman. I spoke to his secretary.

553
00:59:17,065 --> 00:59:18,623
Sir, are you there?

554
00:59:19,568 --> 00:59:22,332
Roger that.
I'll check it out.

555
00:59:50,899 --> 00:59:53,265
I really need to see you.

556
00:59:55,403 --> 00:59:57,371
You're early.

557
01:00:01,109 --> 01:00:04,169
My parents are total frauds.

558
01:00:05,447 --> 01:00:08,644
- Disgusting.
- Of course they are.

559
01:00:08,884 --> 01:00:10,977
They're your parents.

560
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,688
My dad is into hookers.

561
01:00:15,223 --> 01:00:18,090
I think my mom probably
was a hooker.

562
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:30,734
I can't believe I let them influence
every decision I've ever made.

563
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:36,302
You lose your
spiritual virginity...

564
01:00:36,611 --> 01:00:38,943
when you realize
that your parents...

565
01:00:39,181 --> 01:00:41,775
are even bigger hypocrites
than your friends are.

566
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:54,392
Bite it.

567
01:01:02,337 --> 01:01:04,066
Bite it.

568
01:01:05,473 --> 01:01:07,668
Bite it.

569
01:01:08,176 --> 01:01:09,803
Harder.

570
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,775
Harder.

571
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:16,583
Harder.

572
01:01:16,785 --> 01:01:18,582
Harder.

573
01:01:19,354 --> 01:01:21,015
Harder!

574
01:01:36,805 --> 01:01:38,864
Let 's do it now.

575
01:01:39,608 --> 01:01:43,305
You've been pressuring me
for a whole year to sleep with you.

576
01:01:43,912 --> 01:01:45,743
Let 's just do it.

577
01:01:46,648 --> 01:01:49,845
You're only doing it because
you're pissed with your parents.

578
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,351
What 's wrong, Kenny?

579
01:01:55,056 --> 01:01:56,683
Can't you decide?

580
01:01:57,626 --> 01:02:00,823
It doesn't have to be
this complicated, baby.

581
01:02:03,164 --> 01:02:05,257
Don't you like my body?

582
01:02:09,037 --> 01:02:10,868
I love your...

583
01:02:11,072 --> 01:02:13,131
I love your body, baby.

584
01:02:13,575 --> 01:02:18,444
I just want you to be with me
because you want to be with me.

585
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:19,906
That 's all.

586
01:02:20,749 --> 01:02:23,684
Spare me the violins.

587
01:02:27,656 --> 01:02:29,419
Where are you going?

588
01:02:30,225 --> 01:02:32,455
I changed my mind about tonight.

589
01:02:32,661 --> 01:02:36,153
I don't need some
stupid kids sex party.

590
01:02:37,532 --> 01:02:41,127
You have a better company
in mind?

591
01:02:44,706 --> 01:02:48,472
- Frankly, yes.
- Like Mr. Marliston, maybe?

592
01:02:52,447 --> 01:02:55,177
Where did that come from?

593
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:57,781
I've seen you
hanging out with him.

594
01:03:00,722 --> 01:03:05,352
You probably have. So, I should start
looking for you around every corner...

595
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:09,394
eaves-dropping, snooping,
sneaking about.

596
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,036
Kenny, I had no idea
that your poor mind...

597
01:03:16,805 --> 01:03:18,602
was so diseased.

598
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:34,317
If you go now,
I don't want to see you again.

599
01:03:35,824 --> 01:03:37,917
It 's over!

600
01:04:22,937 --> 01:04:26,065
You take the north side, you take
the rear. Beau, you get the south.

601
01:04:26,274 --> 01:04:30,506
- I'll watch the front.
- Do you want to go in with me?

602
01:04:30,712 --> 01:04:34,546
- Be undercover for half an hour.
- Get moving!

603
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:02,376
Sharon, you look voluptuous.

604
01:05:04,846 --> 01:05:06,871
What is that smell?

605
01:05:07,482 --> 01:05:09,973
It 's just a little cologne.

606
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:13,448
I wouldn't go near any candles
if I were you.

607
01:05:13,655 --> 01:05:16,453
It might spontaneously combust.

608
01:05:27,769 --> 01:05:29,964
What 's that smell?

609
01:05:31,973 --> 01:05:33,998
Nothing.

610
01:05:35,343 --> 01:05:37,470
I like it.

611
01:06:08,042 --> 01:06:09,942
You like to dance?

612
01:06:20,989 --> 01:06:23,787
Have you ever
played Death quake?

613
01:06:25,994 --> 01:06:30,090
Okay, but you have
to wear a rubber.

614
01:06:31,566 --> 01:06:33,625
- And I want your CDs.
- Not my imports.

615
01:06:33,835 --> 01:06:37,703
I want everything. Domestic,
imports, bootlegs, works.

616
01:06:42,243 --> 01:06:44,370
Okay, you can have my CDs.

617
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:47,241
- And your snowboard.
- Not my snowboard.

618
01:06:49,217 --> 01:06:52,243
Alright, the board too.

619
01:06:52,453 --> 01:06:56,014
You know, that 's an awful lot
for 1O minutes of sex.

620
01:06:56,224 --> 01:06:58,590
Don't flatter yourself, you'll be
lucky to last 1O seconds.

621
01:06:58,793 --> 01:07:03,696
You just hope when I erupt
you don't end up in the ceiling.

622
01:07:14,142 --> 01:07:17,134
You don't have to be nervous.

623
01:07:17,645 --> 01:07:19,738
You are the one who is shaking.

624
01:07:37,398 --> 01:07:39,025
You okay?

625
01:07:44,772 --> 01:07:46,239
What 's wrong?

626
01:07:46,908 --> 01:07:49,376
I can't face this is
happening again!

627
01:07:49,577 --> 01:07:53,172
Twice today I stopped a girl from
putting her hands in my pants.

628
01:07:53,448 --> 01:07:57,908
Is there something you want to
tell me? I don't mind a challenge.

629
01:08:00,622 --> 01:08:03,921
Right. Neither do I.

630
01:08:04,258 --> 01:08:07,056
Thank you, Sharon.

631
01:08:08,129 --> 01:08:10,893
You could've given it a shot.

632
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:15,091
I always knew he was
a butt pirate.

633
01:08:15,303 --> 01:08:19,865
- You wanna get with a real man?
- No. Do you?

634
01:08:34,489 --> 01:08:38,152
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

635
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:42,488
- How are you?
- Good, and you?

636
01:08:44,465 --> 01:08:46,433
What have you got in this trunk?

637
01:08:46,634 --> 01:08:50,229
Just some old memorabilia.

638
01:08:50,772 --> 01:08:52,933
Do you want a hand?

639
01:08:55,109 --> 01:08:57,202
I could use a hand with this.

640
01:08:57,412 --> 01:08:59,846
Are you sure? It 's going all the way
into my basement.

641
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:05,312
This way.

642
01:09:06,988 --> 01:09:11,857
You're just about the only person
that I trust these days.

643
01:09:11,993 --> 01:09:16,327
Me? What about your dad? I know
how close you are with your father.

644
01:09:16,964 --> 01:09:21,424
I found out some pretty terrible
things about my father recently.

645
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:25,673
Like what?
That he's a liar, a fraud...

646
01:09:25,873 --> 01:09:27,738
a criminal?

647
01:09:40,254 --> 01:09:41,949
What 's in the trunk?

648
01:09:42,824 --> 01:09:44,416
Your dad.

649
01:09:45,493 --> 01:09:47,688
Maybe mine.

650
01:10:00,475 --> 01:10:01,806
Daddy!

651
01:11:08,109 --> 01:11:12,978
Brent, tell us about what
happened 27 years ago...

652
01:11:13,181 --> 01:11:17,379
when you were very drunk.

653
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:23,619
Tom Sisler is in the story, and so
is a woman named Loralee Sherman.

654
01:11:24,358 --> 01:11:26,758
There are people
who can help you.

655
01:11:30,164 --> 01:11:33,497
Don't hurt her.
Please.

656
01:11:34,335 --> 01:11:35,859
I'm not gonna hurt her.

657
01:11:36,971 --> 01:11:39,098
You are, with the truth.

658
01:11:43,244 --> 01:11:45,075
I'll get you started.

659
01:11:46,247 --> 01:11:48,772
I remember the story like this.

660
01:11:48,983 --> 01:11:52,646
It was a dark and scary night...

661
01:11:53,387 --> 01:11:54,854
kind of like tonight.

662
01:11:55,056 --> 01:11:58,150
My mother already told me
the story. You can't hurt me...

663
01:11:58,392 --> 01:12:00,451
Shut up!

664
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:03,562
I'll kill you
if you don't shut up.

665
01:12:03,764 --> 01:12:06,494
Alright.
I'll tell you.

666
01:12:20,615 --> 01:12:22,583
There were four of us.

667
01:12:23,618 --> 01:12:25,518
We were drunk.

668
01:12:27,855 --> 01:12:30,824
About ready to graduate
from high school.

669
01:12:33,761 --> 01:12:37,788
We were going to a party to
celebrate the end of our senior year.

670
01:12:41,469 --> 01:12:44,768
Then, we saw a car broke down
on the side of the road.

671
01:12:46,607 --> 01:12:48,438
It was Loralee.

672
01:12:56,183 --> 01:12:58,481
We all knew her from school.

673
01:12:58,686 --> 01:13:01,712
She was a weird kid.

674
01:13:03,457 --> 01:13:05,391
Kind of pretty in a way, I guess.

675
01:13:06,827 --> 01:13:09,125
I was in really bad shape.

676
01:13:12,867 --> 01:13:15,233
Tom told her to get into his car...

677
01:13:17,305 --> 01:13:19,398
but she wouldn't do it.

678
01:13:20,975 --> 01:13:23,375
So, they started teasing her.

679
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,511
Laughing at her.

680
01:13:28,482 --> 01:13:30,848
And then she got mad.

681
01:13:31,819 --> 01:13:34,219
She called Tom a homo...

682
01:13:34,755 --> 01:13:36,620
and she just took off.

683
01:13:37,758 --> 01:13:40,386
They took off right after her.

684
01:13:44,198 --> 01:13:46,996
That's when things got crazy.

685
01:13:48,769 --> 01:13:51,499
They poured booze
down her throat.

686
01:13:52,506 --> 01:13:55,373
I guess what happened...

687
01:14:04,018 --> 01:14:05,645
You know what happened.

688
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,816
I don't remember,
so, keep going.

689
01:14:09,724 --> 01:14:13,023
First Tom,
then Harry...

690
01:14:14,161 --> 01:14:15,958
then Jim.

691
01:14:16,897 --> 01:14:18,990
Then, they came looking for me...

692
01:14:19,734 --> 01:14:21,668
and they grabbed me...

693
01:14:23,904 --> 01:14:26,134
and threw me on top of her.

694
01:14:27,241 --> 01:14:29,539
But I knew what I was doing.

695
01:14:29,744 --> 01:14:32,178
God help me, I knew what
I was doing!

696
01:14:33,414 --> 01:14:36,247
God, daddy, no!

697
01:14:37,718 --> 01:14:40,585
Happy graduation.

698
01:14:44,892 --> 01:14:46,757
I knew.

699
01:15:10,918 --> 01:15:13,284
Did you know that
she was in love with you?

700
01:15:13,754 --> 01:15:17,952
Love letters, poems,
songs...

701
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:21,151
All things she wrote
before you raped her.

702
01:15:22,563 --> 01:15:27,227
That 's why she came over to the car.
Because she saw your face.

703
01:15:27,668 --> 01:15:32,128
She never had the nerve to approach
the big star quarterback Brent.

704
01:15:33,874 --> 01:15:36,502
You never knew that
she loved you, did you, Brent?

705
01:15:37,912 --> 01:15:39,311
How could you?

706
01:15:39,814 --> 01:15:42,783
She never had the nerve to approach
you before you raped her.

707
01:15:42,983 --> 01:15:46,009
And after you raped her,
there was no one to tell.

708
01:15:47,655 --> 01:15:48,644
Except me.

709
01:15:52,993 --> 01:15:56,724
Over and over again.

710
01:16:01,735 --> 01:16:05,364
It 's difficult to look like the one
person your mother loves...

711
01:16:05,573 --> 01:16:08,201
and hates the most.

712
01:16:10,311 --> 01:16:13,109
We have the same
color of eyes...

713
01:16:15,149 --> 01:16:16,514
dad.

714
01:16:23,858 --> 01:16:26,952
It 's a stinking hypocritical world,
isn't it, Brent?

715
01:16:27,161 --> 01:16:29,686
Where rapists become
the pillars of the community.

716
01:16:30,197 --> 01:16:33,394
And the stinking
hypocritical people in it...

717
01:16:33,601 --> 01:16:37,435
wouldn't even miss their own
worthless lives very much.

718
01:16:37,638 --> 01:16:39,868
So...

719
01:16:40,107 --> 01:16:44,771
what better to deprive them of
the only innocence they have left.

720
01:16:45,913 --> 01:16:47,881
Their precious...

721
01:16:48,849 --> 01:16:51,317
virginal children.

722
01:17:01,962 --> 01:17:04,055
Please!
Don't hurt her.

723
01:17:20,814 --> 01:17:21,803
Does that hurt?

724
01:17:24,118 --> 01:17:25,312
Help!

725
01:17:29,223 --> 01:17:30,212
Shut up!

726
01:17:32,526 --> 01:17:34,687
Goddamn that bell!

727
01:17:37,798 --> 01:17:39,459
I'm coming!

728
01:17:41,502 --> 01:17:45,632
Hi, Kenny. What are you
doing here at midnight?

729
01:17:46,774 --> 01:17:48,537
Mister Marliston...

730
01:17:50,477 --> 01:17:52,308
Something wrong with your mouth?
What do you want?

731
01:18:06,594 --> 01:18:08,858
- Where is Jody?
- How should I know?

732
01:18:09,129 --> 01:18:12,997
- Her bike is parked by your stairs.
- No, it 's not.

733
01:18:20,674 --> 01:18:23,074
Why are you looking at me
like that, Kenny?

734
01:18:23,410 --> 01:18:26,436
- Why are you wearing lipstick?
- Because it makes me pretty.

735
01:18:51,739 --> 01:18:53,639
Jody!

736
01:19:22,536 --> 01:19:26,734
You hurt my daughter.
I'm gonna kill you!

737
01:19:34,248 --> 01:19:35,840
Get out of here!

738
01:19:37,518 --> 01:19:38,815
Go!

739
01:19:43,857 --> 01:19:45,154
Come on!

740
01:19:53,067 --> 01:19:55,661
The music!
To the lounge, come on!

741
01:20:14,188 --> 01:20:19,125
- Hold! Stop right there!
- Mr. Marliston just killed my daddy.

742
01:20:19,326 --> 01:20:21,851
He killed all those kids.
He tried to kill us!

743
01:20:23,197 --> 01:20:27,827
- Who is that with you?
- Kenny Ascott. And it 's all true.

744
01:20:28,602 --> 01:20:31,969
White Knight to Black Queen,
do you copy?

745
01:20:32,206 --> 01:20:33,503
Black Queen
to White Knight, over.

746
01:20:33,707 --> 01:20:36,972
Brent is dead.
Marliston is the killer.

747
01:20:37,177 --> 01:20:40,169
- Do you copy, over?
- You better come now.

748
01:20:40,381 --> 01:20:43,282
This is my post,
I can't just split.

749
01:20:47,955 --> 01:20:49,479
Shit!

750
01:20:49,923 --> 01:20:51,618
Goddamn it!

751
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,258
Nobody is here.

752
01:21:04,805 --> 01:21:07,535
- Help!
- Run!

753
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:16,811
It 's Mr. Marliston!
He is the killer!

754
01:21:18,218 --> 01:21:19,742
Class dismissed.

755
01:21:33,467 --> 01:21:35,094
Run, Jody!

756
01:21:55,355 --> 01:21:57,016
Come on!

757
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,574
Jody!

758
01:22:43,403 --> 01:22:44,665
Stay there.

759
01:23:03,991 --> 01:23:05,982
Kenny!

760
01:23:59,813 --> 01:24:02,611
- Mark, don't!
- Man, get back here.

761
01:24:03,183 --> 01:24:05,583
Mister Marliston.

762
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:57,666
So you have absolutely no idea why
your father was in West Virginia?

763
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:08,207
And you can think of no reason why
Marliston committed these murders?

764
01:25:10,951 --> 01:25:14,614
And after all this, you can't think
of nothing else to tell me?

765
01:25:14,988 --> 01:25:19,186
I think you've asked my daughter
enough questions.

766
01:25:21,328 --> 01:25:25,856
Thank you for now, ladies.
You've been very cooperative.

767
01:25:34,374 --> 01:25:36,171
Let 's go
