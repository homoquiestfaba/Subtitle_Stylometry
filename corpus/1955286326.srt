1
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,263
Babe, leave it!

2
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,432
Let's go!
We gotta go now!

3
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,342
Mommy.

4
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:50,151
It's not him, Faith.

5
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:52,786
Don't leave me, Mommy, please.

6
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:53,754
That's not our son.

7
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,122
God.

8
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:56,690
I don't wanna be alone.

9
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,258
Faith, come on.

10
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:05,734
Mommy, please.

11
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,437
Faith?

12
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:12,739
No!

13
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:14,308
Faith!

14
00:01:14,343 --> 00:01:15,210
Faith!

15
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:19,382
No!

16
00:01:21,502 --> 00:01:26,901
<b>THE AMITYVILLE TERROR</b>

17
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:30,682
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

18
00:01:40,203 --> 00:01:42,338
I'm like 100% sure
we passed this road already.

19
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:43,538
Are you sure you're not lost?

20
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:45,407
No, I know where I'm going.

21
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,609
Feels like we're in
the middle of nowhere.

22
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:50,213
That's because we are in
the middle of nowhere, Hailey.

23
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:52,214
Even if we were in
the middle of nowhere,

24
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:55,184
which we're not by the
way, we're in it together,

25
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:56,353
and that's what counts.

26
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:57,254
Dad.

27
00:01:58,388 --> 00:02:00,689
Well I for one
like the sentiment.

28
00:02:00,724 --> 00:02:03,460
It's a big move, but
we are in it together.

29
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:05,694
Well yeah, just us and Shae.

30
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:07,864
Hey, your aunt Shae
needs us right now.

31
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:08,799
You never know.

32
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:11,369
You might like living with her.

33
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:14,770
Yeah, reformed
addicts are the best.

34
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:15,672
Hailey.

35
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,410
Listen, I know this is hard,

36
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:21,679
but it's not forever.

37
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:25,483
When the time is right, we'll
get our own place, I promise.

38
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:27,884
Great, no service.

39
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,587
I am in hell.

40
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:31,522
Give you some perspective.

41
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:35,525
Really, because from my
perspective, I see trees.

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,262
Look, another tree.

43
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:40,232
Look another tree.

44
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:00,352
Toddy Bear!

45
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:02,354
I missed you.

46
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:03,221
I missed you too.

47
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:03,889
You look great!

48
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:04,822
Thanks, so do you.

49
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:05,690
You look amazing.

50
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:06,625
Thank you.

51
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:07,559
Hi Jess.

52
00:03:07,593 --> 00:03:08,493
Hi.

53
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:10,830
You made it, I'm so happy.

54
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:11,964
Hi Hailey.

55
00:03:11,998 --> 00:03:13,332
How's it goin'?

56
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:14,300
You wearin' your
dad's clothes now?

57
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,568
That's awesome.

58
00:03:15,601 --> 00:03:17,302
Welcome to the
not-so-big city, guys.

59
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:19,371
Also known as the
smallest town ever.

60
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:22,575
Yeah, we're quite far, far
away from pretty much anything.

61
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:24,010
Yeah, at night
you're gonna love it.

62
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:26,945
It's super zen underneath
the stars with the crickets.

63
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,582
I hate crickets.

64
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,351
Who hates crickets?

65
00:03:32,886 --> 00:03:34,454
I do?

66
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:36,588
Come on, let's go, I wanna
show you inside the house.

67
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:38,423
How many times
do you think she says zen?

68
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,461
Don't
start, remember, zen.

69
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:46,801
Home sweet home, ladies.

70
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,776
It's really old.

71
00:03:57,644 --> 00:03:59,646
It's called Victorian.

72
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:09,055
It's got nice cross-breezes.

73
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,824
Let me show you upstairs.

74
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:11,726
Come on.

75
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:16,298
I knew it.

76
00:04:16,332 --> 00:04:17,432
All right guys, be really
careful with the railing.

77
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,400
It's super delicate,

78
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:22,270
and I broke one of them
by accident already.

79
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:26,540
Okay, so each bedroom is like
painted totally different,

80
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:28,876
like different kind of
wallpaper, different colors,

81
00:04:28,912 --> 00:04:30,412
it's really cool.

82
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:32,881
This is my room.

83
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:36,018
It's a mess, shocker.

84
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,654
And then Hailey,
that's your room.

85
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,892
Flowers, awesome.

86
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:51,368
Well this is your room now.

87
00:04:51,402 --> 00:04:54,503
So pick a color
and we'll paint it.

88
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:55,770
Surrounding
yourself by flowers

89
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:57,939
is actually really
good for your chi.

90
00:04:57,973 --> 00:05:00,608
You should consider keepin' it.

91
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:03,314
And this is the master bedroom.

92
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:06,416
This is beautiful.

93
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:14,557
Okay, I'm gonna
check out the bathroom.

94
00:05:14,592 --> 00:05:15,859
See ya, sport.

95
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:18,794
You did good.

96
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:21,764
This house is just amazing.

97
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:24,568
Yeah this is perfect
for us, yes, good job.

98
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:26,370
I knew you guys would like it.

99
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:28,005
I'll leave you to it.

100
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:35,011
I just hope her and
Hailey can get along.

101
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:37,682
I can definitely sense
something brewing there.

102
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:39,716
No, no, they're
gonna get along fine.

103
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:42,588
The problem is
they're so much alike.

104
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:45,623
They're both rebels
without a cause.

105
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:51,929
Okay I think for Hailey
it's called being a teenager.

106
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:55,434
But for Shae, I don't
know what that is.

107
00:05:58,504 --> 00:06:01,572
You know, Shae's been
through a lot with Mom's death.

108
00:06:01,606 --> 00:06:05,743
But I think having family
nearby is going to be

109
00:06:05,777 --> 00:06:07,078
really good for her.

110
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:07,980
I agree.

111
00:06:09,782 --> 00:06:14,453
And with this new job, we
can finally get back on track.

112
00:06:14,488 --> 00:06:16,756
Which I'm very grateful for.

113
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,857
Me too.

114
00:06:23,764 --> 00:06:25,030
Todd, not now.

115
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:26,165
What?

116
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,033
Come on, it's okay.

117
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:28,134
Hailey's outside.

118
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:29,802
Your sister is downstairs.

119
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:31,538
Shae does not care.

120
00:06:31,572 --> 00:06:32,205
Well it's weird.

121
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:34,207
No it's not.

122
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:38,077
Todd, no I'm not in the mood.

123
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:41,814
You're never in
the mood, Jess.

124
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:46,787
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:49,489
It was a long drive.

126
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,795
I'm gonna go unpack.

127
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:07,540
Hey, so how
did you find this place?

128
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:08,943
Just responded to an ad.

129
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:10,077
The neighborhood
looked really nice,

130
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:11,813
and the house was really cheap

131
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:13,048
considering the
size of the place.

132
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:14,049
So I jumped on it.

133
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,784
I'm so surprised that
it was even available.

134
00:07:15,818 --> 00:07:17,820
This house is fantastic.

135
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:20,620
My real estate
agent said something

136
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,656
about the local
economy being down.

137
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,591
People aren't moving.

138
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,258
Makes sense.

139
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:26,261
Well, their loss.

140
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:27,829
I think this place is fantastic.

141
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:30,865
And I absolutely
love the furniture.

142
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:34,135
When I saw those
baroque couches,

143
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,571
I was like where do I sign?

144
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:37,939
Baroque.

145
00:07:37,973 --> 00:07:42,110
Did the family before here
leave their broke couch?

146
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:43,246
I guess so.

147
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:46,683
Nothing really matches.

148
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,651
It's called character.

149
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:51,787
Hey, do I have to go
to school right away?

150
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,256
Hey, yes, you have to
go to school right away.

151
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,892
Is there a specific reason
why you don't want to?

152
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:58,628
Come on Dad, think about it.

153
00:07:58,661 --> 00:07:59,594
The semester's almost over.

154
00:07:59,628 --> 00:08:01,129
I can start next semester.

155
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:04,801
I'll work extra hard, and
then it'll be a nice break.

156
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:05,702
Please?

157
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:08,071
Please?

158
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:13,843
Seriously?

159
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,282
You guys are way
too easy on her.

160
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:19,883
Seriously Shae?

161
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,852
You don't really
have a say here.

162
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:22,853
Excuse me Hailey.

163
00:08:22,887 --> 00:08:25,721
You do not get to talk
to your aunt that way.

164
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,292
I'm sorry, I'm not the
crazy drunk in the family.

165
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:29,325
Hailey.

166
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:31,962
I'm not gonna be the
one that's passed out

167
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:33,163
in the front yard.

168
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:34,765
Now you're just
being a little brat!

169
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,900
You don't get to act like
you're such a good person

170
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:38,870
just because you're
finally sober!

171
00:08:38,903 --> 00:08:39,803
Or are you?

172
00:08:41,672 --> 00:08:42,873
Great!

173
00:08:42,907 --> 00:08:44,209
This house sucks!

174
00:08:58,957 --> 00:08:59,891
Crickets.

175
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:45,171
Nice shot, sport.

176
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,175
What's going on with you?

177
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,410
What do you mean?

178
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:54,248
I mean you were very rude
to your aunt Shae last night.

179
00:09:54,282 --> 00:09:55,215
It's not like you.

180
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:56,716
Yeah, well she's a hypocrite.

181
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,018
And I hate that.

182
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,987
How is she a hypocrite?

183
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:01,854
She tries to
tell everyone else

184
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,057
how to live their life.

185
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,026
She can't even get
her own life right.

186
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:09,829
I get that, but you
have to understand.

187
00:10:09,863 --> 00:10:11,264
Your aunt Shae, she's
been through a lot.

188
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:12,266
We need to be patient
with her, help her.

189
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,137
Isn't she supposed to
be able to help herself?

190
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,137
Isn't that what rehab's for?

191
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:20,173
Sweetheart, can
you do me a favor?

192
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,977
What?

193
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:23,878
Can you be the
bigger person here

194
00:10:23,913 --> 00:10:25,914
so we can all get along?

195
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,785
It'd mean a lot to me.

196
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,386
Okay.

197
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:34,155
That's the Hailey I know.

198
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:35,189
I gotta go to work.

199
00:10:35,223 --> 00:10:36,223
Bye, Dad.

200
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:37,426
You're good right?

201
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,894
Scouts honor.

202
00:12:42,287 --> 00:12:44,155
This town sucks.

203
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,059
Let's go find some trees.

204
00:12:55,469 --> 00:12:56,336
Woo!

205
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:50,993
That's a cool bike.

206
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:52,427
It's a Yamaha 125.

207
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:54,964
Yeah, you ride?

208
00:13:58,001 --> 00:13:59,636
No, I'm just a big motorhead.

209
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,038
Sorry, who are you exactly?

210
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:03,104
I'm Hailey.

211
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,107
Who told you about this place?

212
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:07,075
Nobody, I just
heard the music.

213
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:11,079
So you took
that as an invitation.

214
00:14:11,113 --> 00:14:12,949
Do you like Higher Flux?

215
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:15,218
Yeah, I actually
saw them in concert.

216
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:16,286
I'm so jealous.

217
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,254
What are you doing here?

218
00:14:18,289 --> 00:14:20,289
I just moved here to Amityville.

219
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:22,991
Where in Amityville?

220
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:26,128
On Amity, right
where it dead ends.

221
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,075
So where'd you see them?

222
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:39,376
See who?

223
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:41,312
Higher Flux.

224
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:42,212
L.A.

225
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:44,481
That's cool.

226
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:45,683
Is that where you're from?

227
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:48,319
No, I moved here
from San Francisco.

228
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,155
Okay, well welcome.

229
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,462
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go.

230
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,665
Probably for the best.

231
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,334
Nice to meet you.

232
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:04,971
Yeah okay.

233
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,571
I guess I'll just
see you around.

234
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,106
See you around.

235
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,665
Miss McCallister.

236
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,633
Please, it's Delilah.

237
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,037
Delilah.

238
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:43,342
I guess you came for
the rest of the rent check.

239
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,379
Sorry, I've been
painting all day.

240
00:15:46,414 --> 00:15:47,747
I'm really spaced out.

241
00:15:47,782 --> 00:15:48,983
An artist.

242
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,352
It's more of a hobby really.

243
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:57,056
Sorry I planned on dropping
this off to you later today.

244
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:58,424
Hi.

245
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,560
You must be Jessica.

246
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:01,728
Jessica, this is Delilah.

247
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:03,430
She's the property
manager on the house.

248
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:04,531
Hi.

249
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:08,268
Just stopping by to
see how you're doing.

250
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,171
We love the place.

251
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:11,371
How's the garden?

252
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,040
I've actually
never had one before.

253
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:14,207
But the moment we moved in,

254
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:15,376
I had the sudden urge
to just planting...

255
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,577
Roses.

256
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,544
Yes, exactly.

257
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:18,513
I saw them outside.

258
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:19,546
They're gorgeous.

259
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,715
Thank you.

260
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:21,648
Your husband
and your daughter?

261
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:23,184
Where are they, I would
love to meet them.

262
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:25,219
Todd is at work, and Hailey,

263
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:28,089
she's probably out
exploring or something.

264
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:28,790
Pity.

265
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,098
Do take care of the house.

266
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:37,465
We will.

267
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:40,702
Between you and I, it's
my favorite property.

268
00:16:42,505 --> 00:16:45,773
And don't let the
neighbors bother you.

269
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:48,477
Why do they throw a
lot of crazy parties?

270
00:16:48,511 --> 00:16:50,279
No, they keep to themselves.

271
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:52,280
You're just not gonna
make any friends.

272
00:16:52,314 --> 00:16:54,348
That's all right.

273
00:16:54,382 --> 00:16:57,151
Well we have plenty of
drama in this family.

274
00:16:57,187 --> 00:16:59,788
Remember it's a small town.

275
00:16:59,822 --> 00:17:01,490
People like gossip.

276
00:17:01,524 --> 00:17:02,691
Don't you worry.

277
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:06,794
What happens behind these
walls stays behind these walls.

278
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,465
I'm sure it will.

279
00:17:22,346 --> 00:17:23,480
Hey.

280
00:17:23,513 --> 00:17:24,446
-Hi.
-Can I help you?

281
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:25,615
Yeah I'm Todd Jacobson.

282
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:26,783
I'm here to see Mike.

283
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:27,718
Yeah, we've
been expecting you.

284
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:28,853
Cool.

285
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:29,720
Yeah I'm Karen,
nice to meet you.

286
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:30,721
Hi Karen.

287
00:17:30,754 --> 00:17:32,355
Mike, Mike, hey.

288
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:36,326
I got Todd here for you.

289
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,194
What's up Mike?

290
00:17:37,227 --> 00:17:38,595
Hey Todd, Mike Arkos.

291
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:40,363
Nice to finally meet you man.

292
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:41,866
Glad to have you on board.

293
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:42,832
Thank you.

294
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,801
This is beautiful.

295
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:45,704
What year is it?

296
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:47,538
1955 Imperial.

297
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:48,805
Fixing up for a friend of mine.

298
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:49,874
She's a beauty, isn't she?

299
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:51,574
Yeah, she's great.

300
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:52,609
How is everything else going?

301
00:17:52,644 --> 00:17:53,477
Good man.

302
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:54,778
Happy you're here.

303
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:56,914
Now I can pay full
attention to the other shop.

304
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:59,650
Come on, let me show you around.

305
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,866
-Jesus you scared me.
-What?

306
00:18:15,902 --> 00:18:16,769
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,539
Who's your new friend?

308
00:18:21,574 --> 00:18:24,609
I found her while
I was planting roses.

309
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:27,279
Well she is extremely creepy.

310
00:18:28,581 --> 00:18:29,514
-She's not creepy.
-No she's creepy.

311
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:31,183
She's just old and dirty.

312
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:32,618
Just like you.

313
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,521
You know what, I
bet some little girl

314
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:38,324
loved her very, very, very much.

315
00:18:38,357 --> 00:18:39,658
No this isn't good.

316
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:40,859
The problem with
these old houses,

317
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:43,662
they have a big issue
with their plumbing.

318
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:45,198
I'm gonna go check the basement

319
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:46,666
for some drain cleaner.

320
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:49,303
Have fun with your new friend.

321
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:54,540
Hey Dad?

322
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:55,575
Down here.

323
00:19:01,315 --> 00:19:03,683
This isn't
ominous or anything.

324
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:05,352
All basements
are ominous, honey.

325
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:07,888
That's why they're
underneath the house,

326
00:19:07,922 --> 00:19:10,390
and not in the living room.

327
00:19:10,423 --> 00:19:12,725
So much junk down here.

328
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:15,362
Who leaves this much
stuff when they move?

329
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:16,529
I don't know,

330
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:19,633
but it's basically
all cleaning supplies.

331
00:19:35,284 --> 00:19:35,950
Cool.

332
00:19:37,586 --> 00:19:38,753
Bingo.

333
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,692
Everything's creep
about this house.

334
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,460
Come on, let's go.

335
00:20:21,098 --> 00:20:22,632
Why is it that color?

336
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,966
This is industrial strength.

337
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:24,901
It's really potent.

338
00:20:24,935 --> 00:20:26,368
Actually stand back a bit there,

339
00:20:26,404 --> 00:20:27,371
because if this
gets on your skin,

340
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:28,606
it'll burn you.

341
00:20:43,387 --> 00:20:44,655
My God!

342
00:20:44,688 --> 00:20:46,055
Why does it smell like that?

343
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:47,523
I don't know.

344
00:20:50,862 --> 00:20:53,298
What's in this stuff?

345
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:28,335
Shae?

346
00:21:35,173 --> 00:21:36,040
Shae?

347
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:39,011
I can't get it open.

348
00:21:39,045 --> 00:21:40,380
Shae?

349
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:46,385
Shae?

350
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,654
Shae, open the door!

351
00:21:57,765 --> 00:22:00,400
My skin is burning!

352
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:01,402
I'm bleeding!

353
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:03,137
Honey, I don't think
you're bleeding at all.

354
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,404
It's probably
just an acid trip.

355
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:05,737
Not now, Hailey!

356
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:07,939
I swear Todd, there is
something in the water.

357
00:22:07,975 --> 00:22:09,109
And it was burning me.

358
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:10,177
It was burning my skin.

359
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:14,081
The drain cleaner!

360
00:22:14,114 --> 00:22:15,082
You didn't check to see if
someone was taking a bath?

361
00:22:15,115 --> 00:22:16,482
Because that's not how
plumbing works, Jess.

362
00:22:16,516 --> 00:22:17,484
That's impossible.

363
00:22:17,518 --> 00:22:18,351
I couldn't get up.

364
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:19,486
What are
you talking about?

365
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:20,922
I couldn't get up.

366
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:24,624
Don't touch me!

367
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:25,525
Get out!

368
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:31,166
I told you, it
can't be connected.

369
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:33,168
The drain cleaner,
it's impossible.

370
00:22:33,202 --> 00:22:35,603
What else was it?

371
00:22:35,637 --> 00:22:36,804
I don't know.

372
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:43,511
Maybe Hailey was right.

373
00:22:43,544 --> 00:22:46,046
Maybe she took something.

374
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,514
Excuse me?

375
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,451
Took something?

376
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:49,118
Yeah, like...

377
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:49,984
Great!

378
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:51,554
Some acid or peyote.

379
00:22:51,588 --> 00:22:53,022
Great, we're
living with a junkie.

380
00:22:53,055 --> 00:22:55,055
You said she was
past all that, Todd!

381
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:57,524
We're not living
with a junkie, Jess.

382
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,894
I will keep an eye on her.

383
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:00,463
It's not a problem.

384
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:03,164
Listen, I get it,
she's your sister.

385
00:23:03,198 --> 00:23:05,533
But I have to make sure that you

386
00:23:05,568 --> 00:23:09,003
are not prioritizing your
sister over our daughter.

387
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,140
Jess, I would never do that.

388
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:12,641
Really, cause
you're doing it now.

389
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:13,541
What does that mean?

390
00:23:13,576 --> 00:23:14,477
You gotta face it.

391
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:15,543
Your sister's a drug addict.

392
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:16,878
Our mother just died!

393
00:23:16,913 --> 00:23:20,115
She had one freak
out episode Jessica!

394
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,684
Have a little compassion.

395
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:22,652
Yeah,
but you know what?

396
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:23,853
The way you handled that episode

397
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:24,855
seems like you've
done that before.

398
00:23:24,888 --> 00:23:25,821
How I handled it?

399
00:23:25,856 --> 00:23:26,755
I did everything I could!

400
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:27,689
What are you talking about?

401
00:23:27,724 --> 00:23:29,091
You seem
pretty natural with it!

402
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,693
What?

403
00:23:30,728 --> 00:23:31,928
Is this something
that you guys grew up with?

404
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:33,497
Did you do this when
you guys were kids?

405
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,897
What's going on?

406
00:23:34,932 --> 00:23:36,533
You don't know
that she's on drugs.

407
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:37,767
She had one...
She was on something.

408
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:38,969
I know as much as you.

409
00:23:39,003 --> 00:23:40,270
I don't know.

410
00:23:41,806 --> 00:23:43,974
<i>Still wear it like a tattoo</i>

411
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:48,144
<i>Feel like magic and voodoo?</i>

412
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:05,295
How's she doin'?

413
00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:07,064
She's calmed down.

414
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:11,269
I checked her skin; she's fine.

415
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:13,238
Well that's a relief.

416
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:17,542
Look Jess, I'm s...

417
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:18,575
I'm sorry.

418
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,747
Come here, come here, no.

419
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,181
Listen, I'm sorry.

420
00:24:25,651 --> 00:24:26,919
I'm sorry too.

421
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:32,023
It's just, you know with all
this creepy and craziness.

422
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:33,624
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

423
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:37,295
This is not the first
episode that she has had.

424
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,931
Why does
it even happen?

425
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:40,733
Honestly, I don't know.

426
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:43,236
It could be stress, trauma,
you know Mom's death

427
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:44,871
is a lot for Shae.

428
00:24:46,172 --> 00:24:47,139
Morning sunshine.

429
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:48,306
Hi.

430
00:24:50,343 --> 00:24:52,578
Have I told you how
proud I am of you?

431
00:24:52,612 --> 00:24:53,312
Why?

432
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:54,881
Why, because you're brave.

433
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:56,849
You're going to a new school,
and that totally sucks.

434
00:24:56,882 --> 00:24:58,918
But you're doing it,
and I'm proud of you.

435
00:24:58,953 --> 00:24:59,887
At this point
I'll take any reason

436
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,322
to get out of this house.

437
00:25:01,355 --> 00:25:03,755
Well, whatever motivates you.

438
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,224
It doesn't mean I
wanna go to school.

439
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:06,658
Look you don't
have to wanna go.

440
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:09,028
You just have to
do it, and you are.

441
00:25:09,062 --> 00:25:10,664
So I'm proud of you.

442
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:12,699
Fine, I accept your pride.

443
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:13,701
Thank God!

444
00:25:13,734 --> 00:25:15,936
I wasn't sure where I
was gonna put it today.

445
00:25:15,969 --> 00:25:16,836
I'll see you later.

446
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,037
Bye.

447
00:25:18,071 --> 00:25:19,004
No no no, wait wait wait.

448
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,108
Hailey, I made breakfast!

449
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:34,822
Hi.

450
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:38,258
Is this your ball?

451
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,159
Yeah.

452
00:25:42,697 --> 00:25:43,330
What's your name?

453
00:25:43,365 --> 00:25:45,032
Penny.

454
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:46,233
I'm Hailey.

455
00:25:46,268 --> 00:25:47,669
I like your bike.

456
00:25:47,703 --> 00:25:49,069
I don't get to ride bikes.

457
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:49,973
Yeah?

458
00:25:50,906 --> 00:25:51,839
You wanna check it out?

459
00:25:51,874 --> 00:25:53,875
I can't cross the line.

460
00:25:53,908 --> 00:25:54,909
What line?

461
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,950
Did you meet Rachel?

462
00:26:00,983 --> 00:26:01,817
Rachel?

463
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,684
My friend.

464
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:04,787
She lives in your house.

465
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,920
Did she move?

466
00:26:05,954 --> 00:26:06,822
No.

467
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,858
Well just my family now.

468
00:26:09,893 --> 00:26:11,861
Rachel's there too.

469
00:26:11,894 --> 00:26:14,195
I haven't seen her.

470
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,399
Doesn't mean she's not there.

471
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:34,718
Yeah.

472
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:36,952
Scott Green, please report

473
00:26:36,987 --> 00:26:38,422
to the principal's office.

474
00:26:38,456 --> 00:26:41,090
Scott, please report to
the principal's office.

475
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:42,392
Hey.

476
00:26:42,425 --> 00:26:44,293
Hey yourself.

477
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:48,898
You know, you didn't
have to disappear before.

478
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:50,334
You could've hung out.

479
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:54,137
Yeah, well your friends
weren't exactly inviting.

480
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:58,307
I don't know if I'd
exactly call them my friends.

481
00:26:59,477 --> 00:27:02,846
Okay, well let me
make it up to you.

482
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:06,050
What are you doing after school?

483
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:06,950
I work.

484
00:27:07,986 --> 00:27:09,387
My dad owns the tavern in town.

485
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:11,457
I help him out.

486
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,024
And after work?

487
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:16,460
It's a bar.

488
00:27:16,495 --> 00:27:18,295
I get out kinda late.

489
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:23,101
Okay, then I guess
I'll just see you around.

490
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,340
Has anyone seen Mia today?

491
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,210
I think she has her
period, Mrs. Taylor.

492
00:27:31,244 --> 00:27:32,444
Thank you Theresa
for the update.

493
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:35,013
But I don't think we need to
know Mia's personal business.

494
00:27:35,046 --> 00:27:37,081
I just didn't wanna
be vague, Mrs. Taylor.

495
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:38,350
Moving on.

496
00:27:38,383 --> 00:27:40,952
Let's start where we
left off yesterday.

497
00:27:40,987 --> 00:27:42,188
Exercise seven.

498
00:27:44,823 --> 00:27:45,791
Did you hear?

499
00:27:45,824 --> 00:27:47,225
Mia fucked Tim Bradley
in the back of his car,

500
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,093
and he filmed the whole thing.

501
00:27:48,127 --> 00:27:49,360
And it went viral.

502
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:51,231
Now she's never
leaving her room.

503
00:27:51,264 --> 00:27:53,966
I heard Mia went to the
Amity house on a dare.

504
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:56,469
But that was weeks ago and
no one's seen her since.

505
00:27:56,503 --> 00:28:00,138
That's a lie
Sally, and you know it.

506
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:02,175
What are you
guys talking about?

507
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:03,375
Nothing, new girl.

508
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:04,843
Mind your own business.

509
00:28:04,877 --> 00:28:07,446
Yeah, mind your
business, Dirt Bike.

510
00:28:08,348 --> 00:28:09,182
That's not an insult.

511
00:28:09,215 --> 00:28:10,883
Whatever, Failey.

512
00:28:12,954 --> 00:28:15,490
Failey, you're doing it wrong.

513
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:22,294
Girls, what's
going on over here?

514
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:24,097
I tried to tell her to
be careful, Mrs. Taylor.

515
00:28:24,132 --> 00:28:26,267
But she wouldn't listen.

516
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,935
All right, go get cleaned up.

517
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:34,841
She won't last long.

518
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:42,183
What happened to you?

519
00:28:43,484 --> 00:28:44,485
Wet t-shirt contest.

520
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,253
Room Eight, you missed it?

521
00:28:46,288 --> 00:28:47,989
Apparently.

522
00:28:48,022 --> 00:28:49,022
I didn't get the memo.

523
00:28:49,057 --> 00:28:49,923
Bummer.

524
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:53,228
Here.

525
00:28:56,097 --> 00:28:58,200
It'll be like it never happened.

526
00:28:58,233 --> 00:28:59,100
Okay.

527
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:16,419
Hello.

528
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:20,190
Hello?

529
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:27,963
Hey Shae?

530
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:29,998
Shae, I'm out in the garden.

531
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:33,302
So if the phone rings,
could you answer it?

532
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:33,064
Hey, how's
it goin' over there?

533
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:35,033
Hey Mike, it's goin'.

534
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,235
Yeah?

535
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,103
Yeah, I'm busy.

536
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,070
You okay?

537
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:40,105
You seem a little bit out of it.

538
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,673
Long night.

539
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,310
Actually, let me
ask you somethin'.

540
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:46,545
Have you ever heard of
drain cleaner backing up

541
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,614
and coming out of
another faucet?

542
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:49,481
No.

543
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,448
Sounds crazy right?

544
00:30:50,483 --> 00:30:51,582
Technically impossible.

545
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,619
That's what I said.

546
00:30:53,654 --> 00:30:54,922
Why?

547
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:01,492
My sister Shae was
taking a bath last night

548
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:03,563
and had this freak out episode.

549
00:31:03,597 --> 00:31:06,433
And now my wife is convinced
that the drain cleaner

550
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:10,736
I poured into our sink somehow
came up through the tub.

551
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,305
Wait, Shae Jacobson?

552
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:13,174
Yeah.

553
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:14,139
That's your sister?

554
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:15,075
Yeah.

555
00:31:15,108 --> 00:31:16,542
I used to date Shae

556
00:31:16,577 --> 00:31:18,444
back in college for
about two years.

557
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:19,511
Shit.

558
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,347
You're that Mike!

559
00:31:21,383 --> 00:31:23,750
Yeah, you must be Toddy Bear?

560
00:31:23,785 --> 00:31:25,486
Toddy Bear.

561
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,154
Man I haven't heard
from Shae in years.

562
00:31:27,188 --> 00:31:28,723
How did you guys
end up over here?

563
00:31:28,757 --> 00:31:30,724
Well she was up here
for a while actually,

564
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:32,592
takin' care of our mom.

565
00:31:32,626 --> 00:31:35,028
And she passed, and at
the time it made sense

566
00:31:35,063 --> 00:31:37,264
for my family and her
to all move in together.

567
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:38,365
And she actually
found a great house

568
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,233
in the neighborhood.

569
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:40,433
Where?

570
00:31:40,468 --> 00:31:44,105
Amity Way, at the
end of the cul-de-sac.

571
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,976
So how did you guys
come across that place?

572
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:51,444
She answered an ad.

573
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:52,713
Shae is doing all right?

574
00:31:52,748 --> 00:31:54,349
Yeah, no she's fine.

575
00:31:54,383 --> 00:31:55,217
She's a tough cookie.

576
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,617
So she bounced back.

577
00:31:56,652 --> 00:31:58,253
Look, I gotta go.

578
00:31:58,286 --> 00:32:00,322
I might drop by later
on to say hi to Shae.

579
00:32:00,355 --> 00:32:02,689
Okay, yeah sounds good man.

580
00:32:11,401 --> 00:32:13,603
Hey, I did the inventory,
and loaded the beers.

581
00:32:13,637 --> 00:32:14,570
Can I go meet the guys?

582
00:32:14,603 --> 00:32:15,737
Storage unit locked up?

583
00:32:15,772 --> 00:32:16,639
Yeah.

584
00:32:18,774 --> 00:32:21,275
Hey, Dad if you
need me to stay...

585
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,512
No it's all right, I got
Jones comin' in at eight.

586
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:25,681
You go on, get outta here.

587
00:32:29,085 --> 00:32:29,718
I'll be back later.

588
00:32:29,753 --> 00:32:31,387
How much later?

589
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:32,555
Be home by 10.

590
00:32:33,557 --> 00:32:34,524
No excuses.

591
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:35,425
Yes sir.

592
00:32:40,563 --> 00:32:41,430
Hey.

593
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:43,234
Hey.

594
00:32:44,835 --> 00:32:46,569
I was just gonna
return your jacket.

595
00:32:46,603 --> 00:32:48,304
Right, thank you.

596
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:52,542
How did you know I was here?

597
00:32:52,577 --> 00:32:55,779
You said you worked
at your dad's bar.

598
00:32:55,812 --> 00:32:56,746
There's only two in town.

599
00:32:56,781 --> 00:32:57,781
And one of them's a strip club.

600
00:32:57,814 --> 00:32:58,815
So I used my instincts.

601
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,184
Right, right.

602
00:33:01,652 --> 00:33:05,689
Well I was jut about
to get outta here.

603
00:33:05,724 --> 00:33:07,624
You want a ride?

604
00:33:07,657 --> 00:33:08,792
Why not?

605
00:33:14,366 --> 00:33:15,599
Well come on.

606
00:33:44,864 --> 00:33:46,332
Woo!

607
00:33:46,366 --> 00:33:47,732
That was awesome.

608
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:49,568
Man.

609
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:59,345
So you gonna tell
me why you feel the need

610
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:00,478
to carry that thing around?

611
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:01,614
My crossbow?

612
00:34:01,647 --> 00:34:03,182
Yeah.

613
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:06,553
I mean, this is a
pretty safe neighborhood.

614
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,221
You can never be too careful.

615
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:09,689
It's a historical
fact that small towns

616
00:34:09,722 --> 00:34:12,457
are breeding ground
for serial killers.

617
00:34:12,493 --> 00:34:14,661
Who said that again?

618
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,196
History.

619
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,698
Right, of course.

620
00:34:19,633 --> 00:34:21,768
You ever heard of a gun?

621
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:23,402
Too predictable.

622
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,876
You wanna try?

623
00:34:30,811 --> 00:34:32,211
No, I'm good.

624
00:34:34,749 --> 00:34:38,886
You ever actually shoot
anybody with that thing?

625
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,787
No, but I wouldn't
mind putting an arrow

626
00:34:40,822 --> 00:34:43,422
through my aunt Shae's ass.

627
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:46,793
Okay, so you don't
like her obviously.

628
00:34:46,828 --> 00:34:49,831
Nope, now I have
to live with her.

629
00:34:50,864 --> 00:34:51,933
That sucks.

630
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,603
Yeah.

631
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:57,272
She's gone absolutely crazy.

632
00:34:57,306 --> 00:34:58,806
She was in the
bathtub last night.

633
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,342
She started screaming,
crying, the whole nine yards.

634
00:35:01,376 --> 00:35:03,578
She thought her sin
was burning off.

635
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:04,813
Burning off?

636
00:35:04,847 --> 00:35:08,184
Yeah like acid
burning her skin off.

637
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:11,753
What?

638
00:35:11,787 --> 00:35:13,855
Nothing, nothing.

639
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:18,459
Anyway, she went crazy and
it made my parents fight.

640
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:19,727
And so they got in to
this huge argument.

641
00:35:19,761 --> 00:35:21,964
And it was, seriously what?

642
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:27,770
I shouldn't say anything.

643
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:28,672
Okay.

644
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,807
Something bad
happened in that house.

645
00:35:34,477 --> 00:35:35,744
What happened?

646
00:35:35,778 --> 00:35:39,581
A while back, this
kid, Jimmy Oberest,

647
00:35:39,615 --> 00:35:44,353
he poured acid in the bathtub
and drowned his baby sister.

648
00:35:44,388 --> 00:35:46,990
And then he killed his parents.

649
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:47,891
Shit.

650
00:35:48,824 --> 00:35:50,893
It was a long time ago.

651
00:35:51,962 --> 00:35:53,529
Nobody even really
talks about it anymore.

652
00:35:53,563 --> 00:35:56,399
That's totally creepy.

653
00:35:56,433 --> 00:35:58,868
Won't be taking a
bath any time soon.

654
00:35:58,902 --> 00:36:00,270
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said anything.

655
00:36:00,304 --> 00:36:02,639
No no no, I'm glad you did.

656
00:36:03,941 --> 00:36:07,544
It's nice to just have
someone to talk to.

657
00:36:12,482 --> 00:36:14,952
We should probably get going.

658
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:18,957
Okay.

659
00:36:35,674 --> 00:36:37,442
Hello, hello, Shae?

660
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,785
Yeah
boy, did you find a chicken?

661
00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:46,686
Hello?

662
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:48,854
Hello.

663
00:36:53,025 --> 00:36:53,992
Shae?

664
00:36:54,027 --> 00:36:55,461
Shae, it's me Mike.

665
00:36:55,494 --> 00:36:57,563
Open up, we need to talk.

666
00:37:02,135 --> 00:37:03,002
Shae?

667
00:37:03,036 --> 00:37:04,903
Shae open up, it's me.

668
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,855
Hey, where's Delilah?

669
00:37:21,888 --> 00:37:23,988
Screwin' around
in the kitchen.

670
00:37:28,863 --> 00:37:30,530
Delilah.

671
00:37:30,564 --> 00:37:31,565
Mike.

672
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,999
We have to talk.

673
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,135
Don't stop.

674
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,838
The people you moved
into Amity house,

675
00:37:36,872 --> 00:37:38,439
Shae is a good friend of mine.

676
00:37:38,472 --> 00:37:40,473
Shae I love her.

677
00:37:40,507 --> 00:37:41,841
She's an artist.

678
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:44,777
Look, you have to
get them out of there.

679
00:37:44,813 --> 00:37:45,646
Stop.

680
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,547
Just stop.

681
00:37:57,658 --> 00:38:00,093
I don't tell you how
to run your business.

682
00:38:00,128 --> 00:38:02,597
Don't tell me how to run mine.

683
00:38:02,631 --> 00:38:04,565
It's not right.

684
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:06,067
You know it.

685
00:38:06,102 --> 00:38:09,004
Well the house can't be empty.

686
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,639
As long as tenants pay, I
don't care who they are.

687
00:38:11,673 --> 00:38:13,540
You're a sick bitch.

688
00:38:16,612 --> 00:38:19,749
I love it when you
talk dirty to me.

689
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:23,386
Hey Mike!

690
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:27,590
It's like Vegas, baby.

691
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:29,891
Never bet against the house.

692
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:48,545
Shae?

693
00:38:53,951 --> 00:38:57,487
Shae, Jess is makin'
dinner I just,

694
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,623
I'm sorry.

695
00:38:59,657 --> 00:39:01,958
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

696
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:04,527
What do you want?

697
00:39:04,562 --> 00:39:05,663
I don't want anything.

698
00:39:05,696 --> 00:39:06,896
Jess is making dinner.

699
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,531
I was just wondering
if you wanted some.

700
00:39:08,566 --> 00:39:10,667
I'm not hungry.

701
00:39:10,702 --> 00:39:11,569
Okay.

702
00:39:13,971 --> 00:39:15,939
Are you feelin' all right?

703
00:39:15,975 --> 00:39:17,842
Do I look all right?

704
00:39:19,777 --> 00:39:21,112
You look tired.

705
00:39:22,646 --> 00:39:24,882
Well I feel perfect.

706
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:27,518
Wanna see what I'm working on?

707
00:39:28,853 --> 00:39:31,989
No, no I'll wait
'til it's finished.

708
00:39:54,813 --> 00:39:56,915
Well that was...

709
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,084
Yeah it was.

710
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,821
I...

711
00:40:01,854 --> 00:40:02,722
Keep it.

712
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:06,024
I'll get it the next time.

713
00:40:07,027 --> 00:40:10,263
Son, you know what time it is?

714
00:40:10,297 --> 00:40:12,198
Dad, I'm sorry.

715
00:40:12,232 --> 00:40:13,866
You're sorry, then you
know how late you are.

716
00:40:13,899 --> 00:40:15,133
Get inside now.

717
00:41:52,735 --> 00:41:54,971
What are you doing?

718
00:41:55,005 --> 00:41:56,006
Your door was
open, so I just...

719
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:57,307
Put that down.

720
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:04,980
Do you like it?

721
00:42:05,015 --> 00:42:08,151
Yeah, I mean the
colors are amazing.

722
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:11,355
I think you got a keeper.

723
00:42:17,095 --> 00:42:17,962
Okay.

724
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:24,135
You know what I think?

725
00:42:26,972 --> 00:42:28,907
I think you're just a puppet

726
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:31,275
that says whatever her
daddy wants her to say,

727
00:42:31,308 --> 00:42:34,011
'cause she doesn't have
a personality of her own.

728
00:42:34,045 --> 00:42:36,881
I think you act tough and cool

729
00:42:36,915 --> 00:42:41,053
so you can hide who you really
are, forgettable, unloveable.

730
00:42:42,254 --> 00:42:44,288
Why would you say that?

731
00:42:44,323 --> 00:42:47,057
'Cause the truth is important.

732
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:54,765
I wish you would've died
instead of your brother.

733
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,435
He only pretends to love you.

734
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,037
Think about how happy
your father would be

735
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,338
if he had a son.

736
00:43:31,872 --> 00:43:33,340
Hailey.

737
00:43:37,277 --> 00:43:39,245
Hailey, are you okay?

738
00:44:51,921 --> 00:44:53,023
Damnit.

739
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,182
Have you seen Todd?

740
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,084
Todd!

741
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,220
Fuck!

742
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,103
Shit!

743
00:45:39,138 --> 00:45:39,971
Todd!

744
00:45:40,005 --> 00:45:40,973
Stop the leak.

745
00:45:41,007 --> 00:45:41,639
Todd, stop now!

746
00:45:41,674 --> 00:45:43,174
Turn this thing off!

747
00:45:49,148 --> 00:45:50,615
Todd, stop that, turn it off!

748
00:45:50,649 --> 00:45:52,184
Todd, turn the welder off!

749
00:45:54,653 --> 00:45:56,120
Stop, stop Todd!

750
00:46:01,694 --> 00:46:03,429
Turn the welder off!

751
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:06,031
Todd!

752
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:46,272
You want a cigarette, Failey?

753
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:47,273
No.

754
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:49,174
You gonna tell on us?

755
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:53,680
Why would I stop you from
slowly killing yourselves?

756
00:46:53,714 --> 00:46:56,350
Nobody knows when
they're gonna die, Failey.

757
00:46:56,383 --> 00:46:59,019
I'd treasure this
moment if I were you.

758
00:46:59,053 --> 00:47:02,122
Yeah,
tomorrow could be your last.

759
00:47:02,156 --> 00:47:03,524
Maybe not.

760
00:47:03,558 --> 00:47:05,191
I saw the way you looked
at my boyfriend, btdubs.

761
00:47:05,226 --> 00:47:06,626
Sorry who's your boyfriend?

762
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:09,195
I think you know.

763
00:47:09,231 --> 00:47:13,368
Watch your back, Failey, or
you'll find a knife in it.

764
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:20,075
Ladies?

765
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,477
Hailey.

766
00:47:23,511 --> 00:47:24,379
What are you doing?

767
00:47:24,413 --> 00:47:25,647
She slipped and fell.

768
00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:27,082
Classic Hailey.

769
00:47:30,386 --> 00:47:31,219
Hailey?

770
00:47:31,254 --> 00:47:32,355
Yeah, fine.

771
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,468
He lived in my house.

772
00:47:46,503 --> 00:47:48,470
I know it because my aunt Shae

773
00:47:48,505 --> 00:47:51,407
found his medical
kit in her closet.

774
00:47:51,441 --> 00:47:53,208
And in the picture, his
daughter's holding the same

775
00:47:53,243 --> 00:47:56,612
doll that my mom found
buried in the garden.

776
00:47:56,645 --> 00:47:59,582
Okay, so he lived there.

777
00:47:59,616 --> 00:48:00,750
So what?

778
00:48:00,784 --> 00:48:03,386
So there's no record
of him since 2004.

779
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,355
He doesn't exist Brett.

780
00:48:07,824 --> 00:48:08,691
He's dead.

781
00:48:11,262 --> 00:48:13,330
He died in my house.

782
00:48:13,363 --> 00:48:17,233
His family died in
my house, I know it.

783
00:48:17,267 --> 00:48:20,570
I can't prove it,
but I've seen him.

784
00:48:20,604 --> 00:48:22,139
And then there's this music box,

785
00:48:22,173 --> 00:48:25,109
and it plays at
really weird times.

786
00:48:26,277 --> 00:48:27,411
Like it knows.

787
00:48:32,484 --> 00:48:34,018
Do I sound crazy?

788
00:48:36,087 --> 00:48:38,022
No, I don't think so.

789
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:50,133
I can't think
about this right now.

790
00:48:50,169 --> 00:48:53,239
Yeah that's fine,
we'll just chill.

791
00:49:22,269 --> 00:49:23,703
I haven't seen you
around here before.

792
00:49:23,736 --> 00:49:25,872
What's your name?

793
00:49:25,906 --> 00:49:27,273
Todd.

794
00:49:27,307 --> 00:49:30,242
Todd, you must not
live around here.

795
00:49:32,246 --> 00:49:33,378
Just drivin' through?

796
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:35,347
No I live here.

797
00:49:35,382 --> 00:49:36,849
Lucky for me.

798
00:49:41,623 --> 00:49:43,557
I'm married.

799
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:44,423
Didn't ask.

800
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,629
What about you,
your first concert?

801
00:49:51,498 --> 00:49:54,267
I have never
been to a concert.

802
00:49:55,502 --> 00:49:56,703
No way.

803
00:49:56,738 --> 00:49:57,638
Are you serious?

804
00:49:57,672 --> 00:49:58,606
Yeah.

805
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,508
Not a lot of bands come
through Amityville.

806
00:50:03,811 --> 00:50:04,679
Right.

807
00:50:09,385 --> 00:50:13,889
We should run away, escape
to civilization some time.

808
00:50:13,923 --> 00:50:15,624
Go see a concert?

809
00:50:16,925 --> 00:50:19,759
I actually wanna manage
my own band someday.

810
00:50:19,795 --> 00:50:24,133
Well, you know more about
what you wanna do than I do.

811
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:28,937
My dad gets a lot
of credit for that.

812
00:50:28,971 --> 00:50:31,640
Taught me everything I know.

813
00:50:31,674 --> 00:50:35,811
How to be curious, ride a bike,
shoot arrows, play guitar.

814
00:50:37,947 --> 00:50:39,381
You play guitar too?

815
00:50:39,414 --> 00:50:40,414
You play guitar?

816
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:41,284
Yeah!

817
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:43,718
Yeah, that's awesome!

818
00:50:43,753 --> 00:50:44,620
Yeah...

819
00:50:44,653 --> 00:50:46,322
We should jam.

820
00:50:46,356 --> 00:50:47,557
If I can remember how to play.

821
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:50,792
My mom was teaching
me before she died.

822
00:50:52,862 --> 00:50:55,531
I didn't know
your mom was dead.

823
00:50:55,565 --> 00:50:56,398
Yeah.

824
00:50:56,433 --> 00:50:57,366
Sorry.

825
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,569
It happened when I was 13.

826
00:51:03,241 --> 00:51:05,707
I'm just glad that I got
the chance to know her.

827
00:51:05,742 --> 00:51:06,609
You know?

828
00:51:07,577 --> 00:51:08,444
Yeah.

829
00:51:11,682 --> 00:51:14,417
I actually had a little brother.

830
00:51:17,254 --> 00:51:19,722
But he died when I
was really little.

831
00:51:19,756 --> 00:51:21,424
He was just a baby.

832
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,628
I didn't know him at all.

833
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:28,799
You know it's funny.

834
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:34,304
A lot of time when
people find out

835
00:51:34,338 --> 00:51:38,241
that I lost my mom, they
try to be sympathetic.

836
00:51:40,578 --> 00:51:41,712
But I know that
for the most part

837
00:51:41,747 --> 00:51:43,348
they don't get it.

838
00:51:45,751 --> 00:51:49,254
It's just nice to meet
somebody who does.

839
00:52:14,379 --> 00:52:15,780
Come on, let's go.

840
00:52:17,049 --> 00:52:18,716
Where?

841
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:22,921
I think I might know
somebody who can help us.

842
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:36,802
Hi Brett, I was expecting you.

843
00:52:36,836 --> 00:52:38,938
This is your room?

844
00:52:38,972 --> 00:52:40,373
It's cool right?

845
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,507
Those are my solar crystals.

846
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:45,711
These ones absorb positive
energy, those deflect evil.

847
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:46,779
Deflect evil.

848
00:52:46,814 --> 00:52:48,681
Yeah, keep out the bad energy.

849
00:52:48,716 --> 00:52:50,482
What about that
one around your neck?

850
00:52:50,516 --> 00:52:52,951
You told me it was
really powerful.

851
00:52:52,986 --> 00:52:55,355
Yeah, it's an ancient
protection crystal.

852
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:56,656
It's been passed down
for several generations

853
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:57,891
in my family.

854
00:52:57,926 --> 00:52:59,459
Can't part with it.

855
00:52:59,492 --> 00:53:01,794
Well do you have anything
like that for Hailey?

856
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:03,463
She just moved to a new
place in Amityville,

857
00:53:03,497 --> 00:53:05,700
and her aunt is kinda nuts.

858
00:53:06,834 --> 00:53:09,869
Yeah, I have lots of
stones for new houses.

859
00:53:09,903 --> 00:53:11,738
Hailey go into the bathroom
and grab the floral bag

860
00:53:11,773 --> 00:53:13,909
in the third drawer.

861
00:53:13,943 --> 00:53:14,842
Okay, I...

862
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:19,447
It's the second
door on the right.

863
00:53:20,915 --> 00:53:23,051
What are you doing?

864
00:53:23,085 --> 00:53:24,252
What do you mean?

865
00:53:24,286 --> 00:53:26,755
That's the new girl that
just moved to the Amity house.

866
00:53:26,788 --> 00:53:27,955
Yeah, how did you...

867
00:53:27,989 --> 00:53:28,956
Word travels fast.

868
00:53:28,991 --> 00:53:30,825
Not to mention, Theresa
is not a fan of hers.

869
00:53:30,859 --> 00:53:33,495
Come on Jenny, she
really needs your help.

870
00:53:33,528 --> 00:53:34,729
Of course she needs my help.

871
00:53:34,763 --> 00:53:36,097
Everyone needs my help.

872
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:37,832
But I can't get
involved in this.

873
00:53:37,867 --> 00:53:39,033
You have to go.

874
00:53:39,068 --> 00:53:41,336
Hey, Jenny, is this it?

875
00:53:42,472 --> 00:53:43,340
Exactly.

876
00:53:45,408 --> 00:53:46,808
This is bloodstone.

877
00:53:46,842 --> 00:53:50,112
It's known for its
protective qualities.

878
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:53,983
I think I'm gonna need
somethin' a little bigger.

879
00:53:54,016 --> 00:53:55,851
It was nice to
meet you Hailey.

880
00:53:55,886 --> 00:53:58,387
Thanks for coming over.

881
00:53:58,422 --> 00:53:59,923
See you later Brett?

882
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:14,371
Hey baby.

883
00:54:16,973 --> 00:54:19,909
Why didn't you
answer your phone?

884
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:24,949
I was here the whole
time, sweetheart.

885
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:36,026
I killed Mike today.

886
00:54:39,997 --> 00:54:40,865
What?

887
00:54:45,069 --> 00:54:46,537
I killed Mike.

888
00:54:48,105 --> 00:54:50,075
What happened?

889
00:55:05,624 --> 00:55:07,625
There was an accident.

890
00:55:08,826 --> 00:55:10,828
Well accidents happen.

891
00:55:13,533 --> 00:55:14,801
Not like this.

892
00:55:15,935 --> 00:55:19,505
There was fire and it
just happened so quick.

893
00:55:23,142 --> 00:55:25,745
And I saw the look in his eyes

894
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:30,683
right before he

895
00:55:32,987 --> 00:55:34,787
right before he died.

896
00:55:49,837 --> 00:55:52,840
I just wanna make
you feel better.

897
00:57:15,727 --> 00:57:17,928
Todd, is that you?

898
00:57:21,331 --> 00:57:22,198
Jess?

899
00:57:31,242 --> 00:57:33,977
I had the strangest day today.

900
00:57:36,013 --> 00:57:38,748
None of my roses wanted to live.

901
00:57:40,685 --> 00:57:42,853
Nothing wants to live here.

902
00:58:28,767 --> 00:58:29,635
Hey.

903
00:58:33,173 --> 00:58:34,041
Hey.

904
00:58:56,329 --> 00:58:57,863
Hey.

905
00:58:57,897 --> 00:59:00,966
If I get involved in
this and people find out,

906
00:59:01,001 --> 00:59:03,903
you know what's gonna happen.

907
00:59:03,939 --> 00:59:05,106
Yeah, I know.

908
00:59:06,307 --> 00:59:09,809
And there's no guarantee
it's gonna change the outcome.

909
00:59:09,844 --> 00:59:12,179
Nobody, I mean nobody can know.

910
00:59:12,212 --> 00:59:13,479
I get it.

911
00:59:13,514 --> 00:59:16,083
Look Hailey is a good person.

912
00:59:18,052 --> 00:59:20,087
She doesn't deserve this.

913
00:59:21,322 --> 00:59:23,391
I have an idea.

914
00:59:46,782 --> 00:59:47,949
That's the living room.

915
00:59:47,983 --> 00:59:49,951
Kitchen's down
back through there.

916
00:59:49,985 --> 00:59:51,886
And your bedroom?

917
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,188
It's upstairs.

918
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:10,272
This is it.

919
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:20,115
So you gonna rid the house
of evil spirits or something?

920
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,050
Can't get rid of the
evil, it's too powerful.

921
01:00:22,084 --> 01:00:24,987
The best thing I can do
is create a safe place.

922
01:00:25,023 --> 01:00:26,524
A safe place?

923
01:00:26,557 --> 01:00:29,324
Somewhere you can
go if things get bad.

924
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,495
What do you mean by bad?

925
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,029
I mean bad.

926
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,805
What about my parents?

927
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,006
You can bring them with you.

928
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,340
This can be their
safe place too.

929
01:00:45,376 --> 01:00:46,811
I'm gonna put these
around the room.

930
01:00:46,845 --> 01:00:49,447
Whatever you do,
don't move them.

931
01:00:53,885 --> 01:00:55,218
Can I get some water?

932
01:00:55,253 --> 01:00:56,587
Yeah, yeah of course.

933
01:00:56,622 --> 01:00:58,323
I'll grab you some.

934
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:44,204
Hey, how's it going?

935
01:01:45,438 --> 01:01:46,940
The spell's complete.

936
01:01:46,974 --> 01:01:48,943
I think you'll be okay.

937
01:01:56,017 --> 01:01:57,084
Jenny!

938
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:22,075
Looks like someone
tried to help Failey

939
01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:23,543
bite off more than she can chew.

940
01:02:46,436 --> 01:02:48,137
<i>You heard the
whispers and the rumors</i>

941
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:49,671
<i>When you rolled into town</i>

942
01:02:49,706 --> 01:02:52,274
<i>You felt the evil
in the air outside</i>

943
01:02:52,307 --> 01:02:53,541
<i>swirlin' round and round</i>

944
01:02:53,575 --> 01:02:57,477
<i>I'm all emaciated glad you
made it through the front door</i>

945
01:02:57,513 --> 01:03:01,283
<i>But chances are you might
not like what's in store</i>

946
01:03:01,317 --> 01:03:05,054
<i>Pay no attention to the
voices you hear beyond the walls</i>

947
01:03:05,087 --> 01:03:09,024
<i>Those iridescent
nasty windbag in your woo</i>

948
01:03:09,058 --> 01:03:12,593
<i>And you don't wanna
see this other side of me</i>

949
01:03:12,628 --> 01:03:17,198
<i>But can you see me
from a new point of view</i>

950
01:03:17,233 --> 01:03:21,193
<i>See delusions and deja vu</i>

951
01:03:21,204 --> 01:03:24,740
<i>Feels all broken and insulting</i>

952
01:03:24,775 --> 01:03:28,609
<i>Feel wear it like a tattoo</i>

953
01:03:28,645 --> 01:03:32,983
<i>Feel like magic and voodoo?</i>

954
01:03:55,273 --> 01:03:56,439
Hello.

955
01:03:56,474 --> 01:03:59,242
Hi, I'm looking
for David Cranston.

956
01:03:59,277 --> 01:04:00,644
Speaking.

957
01:04:00,677 --> 01:04:03,781
Awesome, I was actually
calling about your brother,

958
01:04:03,815 --> 01:04:05,549
Willis Cranston.

959
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:06,718
Who is this?

960
01:04:07,819 --> 01:04:09,153
I actually moved
into the house

961
01:04:09,188 --> 01:04:10,689
I think your brother
used to live in.

962
01:04:10,723 --> 01:04:12,491
I found some of his
surgical supplies,

963
01:04:12,525 --> 01:04:16,093
and I wanted to
return them to...

964
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,763
Well that's very kind of you.

965
01:04:17,796 --> 01:04:21,465
But we haven't heard from
Willis for over a decade now.

966
01:04:21,499 --> 01:04:23,534
Would you mind if
I ask what happened?

967
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:24,768
I wish I knew.

968
01:04:24,803 --> 01:04:27,638
Once he moved to Amityville,
we never heard from him again.

969
01:04:27,673 --> 01:04:30,775
I contacted the police who
said that the property manager

970
01:04:30,809 --> 01:04:34,346
said that they'd handed in
the notice and moved on.

971
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,048
To be honest it
was very strange.

972
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:38,584
He would never just have
left without telling me.

973
01:04:38,617 --> 01:04:40,753
It doesn't make any sense.

974
01:04:42,088 --> 01:04:45,558
Who was the property
manager at the time?

975
01:04:47,294 --> 01:04:50,263
McCallister,
Delilah McCallister.

976
01:07:11,344 --> 01:07:12,143
Well well.

977
01:07:13,578 --> 01:07:16,748
Honey, you know
trespassing is illegal.

978
01:07:19,685 --> 01:07:21,320
Put the files down.

979
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:28,725
I will cut out your
heart and eat it.

980
01:08:31,927 --> 01:08:34,028
How does somebody just
fall out of a closed window?

981
01:08:34,061 --> 01:08:35,796
I don't know, Jess.

982
01:08:35,829 --> 01:08:38,364
And our neighbors just stood
around like nothing happened?

983
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,768
Hailey?

984
01:08:39,801 --> 01:08:42,036
Dad, Dad I just went to
Delilah McCallister's house

985
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:45,573
and I found all of this
information about past renters.

986
01:08:45,606 --> 01:08:46,740
There's been hundreds.

987
01:08:46,775 --> 01:08:48,076
Dad, hundreds!

988
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:49,043
Okay Hailey, slow down.

989
01:08:49,077 --> 01:08:49,977
What are you talking about?

990
01:08:50,013 --> 01:08:51,746
Since the '70s,
people have been moving

991
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:53,047
in and out of our house.

992
01:08:53,082 --> 01:08:56,051
They never stay longer
than three months.

993
01:08:56,085 --> 01:08:58,620
I'm willing to bet
they're all missing.

994
01:08:58,654 --> 01:08:59,788
Okay Hailey, this is crazy.

995
01:08:59,823 --> 01:09:01,023
Why don't you just
come home and...

996
01:09:01,056 --> 01:09:02,724
Dad, you need to
get Mom and Shae,

997
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:04,060
and you need to get
out of the house.

998
01:09:04,094 --> 01:09:05,859
Okay, I'm at the police station.

999
01:09:06,961 --> 01:09:09,097
Hailey, Hailey?

1000
01:09:09,131 --> 01:09:09,999
Lost her.

1001
01:09:10,899 --> 01:09:12,067
Dad?

1002
01:09:12,102 --> 01:09:13,301
Dad?

1003
01:09:13,336 --> 01:09:15,905
I just, I don't think that
we should be here anymore Todd.

1004
01:09:15,938 --> 01:09:16,872
I'm serious.

1005
01:09:16,906 --> 01:09:18,473
We're gonna wait for
Hailey to come home.

1006
01:09:18,509 --> 01:09:19,542
We will leave first
thing in the morning.

1007
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:21,009
I'm gonna go talk to Shae okay?

1008
01:09:21,044 --> 01:09:23,379
I'm gonna start packing.

1009
01:09:32,889 --> 01:09:33,723
Hey.

1010
01:09:33,758 --> 01:09:34,791
Brett?

1011
01:09:34,825 --> 01:09:36,560
Thank God, are you okay?

1012
01:09:36,593 --> 01:09:37,859
Yeah I'm fine.

1013
01:09:38,829 --> 01:09:40,931
I heard about Jenny.

1014
01:09:40,964 --> 01:09:42,865
Look I am so sorry.

1015
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:46,069
Brett I think I know what's
happening with my house.

1016
01:09:46,102 --> 01:09:47,069
Hailey hold on.

1017
01:09:47,104 --> 01:09:48,739
Delilah is
moving people in there

1018
01:09:48,774 --> 01:09:49,707
and killing them.

1019
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:51,408
It's not Delilah.

1020
01:09:52,476 --> 01:09:54,344
I mean it is, kind of.

1021
01:09:55,645 --> 01:09:58,948
Do you remember what I told
you about Jimmy Oberest?

1022
01:09:58,984 --> 01:10:01,819
Yeah he drowned his
sister in a bathtub

1023
01:10:01,853 --> 01:10:03,721
with acid and killed his family.

1024
01:10:03,755 --> 01:10:07,891
Hailey, Jimmy and his entire
family were into black magic.

1025
01:10:11,028 --> 01:10:14,866
They believed if they made
these human sacrifices

1026
01:10:14,899 --> 01:10:17,134
that they'd be
granted eternal life.

1027
01:10:17,169 --> 01:10:18,803
They killed people.

1028
01:10:18,837 --> 01:10:20,372
Lots of people.

1029
01:10:21,808 --> 01:10:23,841
Whatever they did, it was like

1030
01:10:23,876 --> 01:10:27,011
they opened a portal
to hell or something.

1031
01:10:27,044 --> 01:10:29,079
What's Delilah's connection?

1032
01:10:29,115 --> 01:10:32,617
Delilah was
Jimmy's baby sister.

1033
01:10:32,651 --> 01:10:34,085
What?

1034
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,754
Not the
one he drowned.

1035
01:10:35,787 --> 01:10:37,156
She had pneumonia.

1036
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:39,758
She was in a hospital during
the time of the murders.

1037
01:10:39,793 --> 01:10:42,194
My God, I'm at
the police station.

1038
01:10:42,227 --> 01:10:45,497
And they're putting
Jenny's body in a trunk.

1039
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:46,765
Look there's so much more.

1040
01:10:46,798 --> 01:10:48,033
I need to tell you in person.

1041
01:10:48,066 --> 01:10:49,435
Look, I gotta go.

1042
01:10:49,469 --> 01:10:52,806
I'll meet you at the
cabin in an hour okay?

1043
01:11:46,227 --> 01:11:47,528
Todd?

1044
01:11:47,562 --> 01:11:48,963
Todd what's wrong?

1045
01:11:49,898 --> 01:11:50,932
Todd?

1046
01:11:50,965 --> 01:11:52,534
Todd let me out!

1047
01:11:52,567 --> 01:11:54,770
Todd I can't open the door!

1048
01:12:01,611 --> 01:12:02,478
Todd?

1049
01:12:09,718 --> 01:12:10,587
Todd?

1050
01:12:17,926 --> 01:12:18,793
Todd?

1051
01:12:21,997 --> 01:12:22,866
Todd!

1052
01:12:37,313 --> 01:12:39,014
Bad choice Brett.

1053
01:13:46,685 --> 01:13:49,020
Bravo, I see you found
your family's new home.

1054
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,189
Do you like it?

1055
01:13:50,224 --> 01:13:52,092
It's super cozy.

1056
01:13:52,126 --> 01:13:54,394
Why are you doing this to me?

1057
01:13:54,428 --> 01:13:56,629
I'm doing you a favor.

1058
01:13:57,796 --> 01:13:59,365
You were marked
for death anyway.

1059
01:13:59,398 --> 01:14:02,968
And trust me, this stuff is
better than the alternative.

1060
01:14:03,003 --> 01:14:04,371
How was I marked for death?

1061
01:14:04,405 --> 01:14:06,773
Nobody who lives in the
Amity house comes out alive.

1062
01:14:06,807 --> 01:14:08,808
And if we don't feed the house
and keep the spirits happy,

1063
01:14:08,841 --> 01:14:10,309
it comes for us.

1064
01:14:10,344 --> 01:14:13,012
No one with a choice wants that.

1065
01:14:13,047 --> 01:14:14,246
Right girls?

1066
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,116
Sorry Theresa, but
your possessed house

1067
01:14:17,151 --> 01:14:19,620
is about to get real hungry.

1068
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:26,060
Holy shit, T, you know
how she felt about her face!

1069
01:14:29,863 --> 01:14:31,998
You know Hailey, you and
I could've been friends.

1070
01:14:32,033 --> 01:14:33,434
We have a lot in common.

1071
01:14:33,467 --> 01:14:36,037
No, Theresa, we have
absolutely nothing in common!

1072
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:37,671
I disagree!

1073
01:14:37,705 --> 01:14:39,440
We both loved Brett didn't we?

1074
01:14:39,474 --> 01:14:41,409
Why'd you have to go and
steal my boyfriend, Hailey?

1075
01:14:41,444 --> 01:14:43,411
You have to ruin everything
you selfish bitch!

1076
01:14:43,444 --> 01:14:45,045
Brett was never
your boyfriend!

1077
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:46,012
Yeah?

1078
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:48,649
Well now he'll never be yours!

1079
01:16:29,554 --> 01:16:31,054
My God, no!

1080
01:16:31,089 --> 01:16:32,791
No no no no no no no no!

1081
01:16:32,826 --> 01:16:35,761
Please please please
please please.

1082
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:45,937
Shae!

1083
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:32,648
Hailey.

1084
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,287
Hailey.

1085
01:18:39,322 --> 01:18:40,522
Hailey.

1086
01:18:40,556 --> 01:18:42,492
You can't hide from me.

1087
01:18:49,566 --> 01:18:50,433
Hailey!

1088
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:40,413
It's vacant and
available immediately.

1089
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:43,450
Thank you so much for
showing us your house, Delilah.

1090
01:20:43,484 --> 01:20:46,487
We're looking for a nice
home to raise our family in.

1091
01:20:49,423 --> 01:20:50,792
I'm gonna have a
brother or sister.

1092
01:20:50,826 --> 01:20:54,327
That's right, we're
trying for another.

1093
01:20:54,362 --> 01:20:57,165
Well that's wonderful
because we have three bedrooms.

1094
01:20:58,466 --> 01:21:00,201
It's exactly what
we're lookin' for.

1095
01:21:00,234 --> 01:21:01,301
Yeah.

1096
01:21:01,336 --> 01:21:03,738
I think we'll take it.

1097
01:22:50,322 --> 01:22:53,357
<i>Girl you got that hold on me</i>

1098
01:22:53,392 --> 01:22:57,529
<i>I say hey you
got your hold on me</i>

1099
01:23:00,834 --> 01:23:03,469
<i>And I find the clouds cooler</i>

1100
01:23:03,502 --> 01:23:07,540
<i>I can meet you
in the stratosphere</i>

1101
01:23:07,575 --> 01:23:11,711
<i>I'm feelin' warm and
fuzzy late at night</i>

1102
01:23:12,679 --> 01:23:15,481
<i>Expedition back to earth</i>

1103
01:23:15,517 --> 01:23:19,220
<i>I start to question
my self-worth</i>

1104
01:23:19,255 --> 01:23:22,324
<i>So I start beggin'
for one more dose</i>

1105
01:23:22,358 --> 01:23:23,658
<i>Of course</i>

1106
01:23:23,692 --> 01:23:27,828
<i>I said hey girl, you
got that hold on me</i>

1107
01:23:29,331 --> 01:23:33,468
<i>I said hey girl, you
got your hold on me</i>

1108
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:39,710
<i>As we cruise among the stars</i>

1109
01:23:39,743 --> 01:23:43,313
<i>The sun and moon
don't seen that far</i>

1110
01:23:43,346 --> 01:23:47,483
<i>At hyper speed
we blast away yeah</i>

1111
01:23:48,653 --> 01:23:51,455
<i>But as our rocket fuel was out</i>

1112
01:23:51,489 --> 01:23:55,393
<i>You say farewell
and then breathe while</i>

1113
01:23:55,428 --> 01:23:59,531
<i>Gravitational pull
pulls me, pulls me</i>

1114
01:23:59,565 --> 01:24:06,573
<i>I said hey girl, yeah</i>
