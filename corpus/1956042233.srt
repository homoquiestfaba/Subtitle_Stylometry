00:00:53,419 --> 00:01:00,655
Title: Wacky DNA

3
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:03,624
Sometimes it's hard to know where you are.

4
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:11,465
What are you doing, where are you going?
Even when it's time

5
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:18,340
It's often hard to remember what you've done in the past.

6
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:21,139
Or what I want to do next

7
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:25,714
The next night is like the more abstract concept

8
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:29,219
I do not even have time to think about it.

9
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:34,355
The weather is mild and the sun is rising.

10
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,861
The ocean is beautiful and everything is going well.

11
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:44,260
At point A, you are someone At
point B, you are someone else.

12
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,272
At point C, you become another level...

13
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:56,270
Angle, fragment, field, area

14
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,783
Some people are very good at converting

15
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:02,319
Such a break

16
00:02:03,722 --> 00:02:10,184
Others are harmed and unable to do so.

17
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:26,840
How are you today? James

18
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:35,217
Where is he? I feel shrunken on my back.

19
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,652
I do not understand where he is.

20
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:40,156
Do you know where you are? James

21
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:48,222
Of course New York I
mean, California.

22
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,325
You're not in California, but that does not matter.

23
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:54,537
Did you sleep well last night? James

24
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,938
I mean, are you asleep?

25
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,407
I slept very well, thank you.

26
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:02,942
Who is he? Why are you asking these questions?

27
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:04,948
Can you hear it? James

28
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:10,783
I have nothing, of course I can hear.
I heard your voice

29
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,458
So many questions are really hard to freak out

30
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,869
I can certainly hear, everyone can hear.

31
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:29,235
What about your arm? James

32
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:34,136
Arm?

33
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,475
Is not the arm here?

34
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,548
Look, is not it?

35
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:47,615
Ok look

36
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,794
Are they still running smoothly? James

37
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:57,359
Of course, in good
condition Can also fold

38
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:59,494
Very normal

39
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:02,631
Why did you ask my arm?

40
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:07,269
Just confirm, James.
Confirm your arm.

41
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:13,141
Is that you? James, his people

42
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,480
My people?

43
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:22,859
My people? I'm here
Right behind the arm

44
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:30,898
It's just that my people are not as full as their arms.
a little confused

45
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:33,733
It's not always here.

46
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:38,102
I can not wear it all the time.

47
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:45,474
Do you really know where you are? James

48
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,645
There are so many problems

49
00:04:54,926 --> 00:04:59,386
This is the story of an actor
He is no longer acting

50
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:04,802
This is a story about your sister.
She is always...

51
00:05:04,903 --> 00:05:06,393
Come without a trace

52
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:11,306
This is a story about his friend.

53
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:13,769
And its neighbors

54
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,939
I'm not sure I can tell Michael that.

55
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:19,347
I can not forget the fact that he killed his stepmother.

56
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,645
Entering and leaving home

57
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:28,356
Tight to each other

58
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:31,692
Intimacy

59
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:33,594
Tolerance

60
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,360
Patience

61
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:37,492
Restless

62
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:39,092
Even broke

63
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:44,276
How can anyone know?

64
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:46,478
How can anyone know?
These photos are in the town of Gayana Jones.

65
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:46,578
How can anyone know?

66
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:46,778
How can anyone know?
Filmed a few hours after the collective suicide

67
00:05:46,778 --> 00:05:49,269
How can anyone know?
Filmed a few hours after the collective suicide

68
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:52,009
900 swollen bodies stacked on the floor

69
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:54,449
Including 200 children

70
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:58,546
There is a bucket full of cyanide nearby.

71
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:01,455
A few months ago, Pastor Jim Jones was in...

72
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,391
- San Francisco People's Temple...
(I.e.

73
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:04,757
Proverbs in the pulpit

74
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:08,196
His followers are mostly poor blacks...

75
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,325
Donate Your Property

76
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:26,806
James

77
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:28,249
What happened?

78
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:29,342
James

79
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:32,218
- What is it?
- We're watching TV, thank you.

80
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:33,416
(I.e.

81
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:34,856
You blocked the TV.

82
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,474
"James, how are you doing this?"
As?

83
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:55,637
The flash is so bright

84
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:58,011
Are we watching TV?

85
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:59,606
She likes the pictures taken.

86
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:00,707
Right? Patricia

87
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:01,911
Right

88
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,180
Look

89
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:06,452
Where did the white shirt come from?

90
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:08,589
- This one?
- right

91
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:11,059
This shirt is blue

92
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:14,355
OK

93
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:17,162
What are you doing? To wash clothes

94
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,964
I have a little time now.

95
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,473
I just want to help you bend your shirt.

96
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:28,144
I know I'm wearing a white shirt today.

97
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:30,680
But I prefer the blue answer.

98
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:34,443
Blue, thanks for helping me fold clothes.

99
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:36,588
Do you believe in Jim Jones?

100
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:37,222
"Agricultural Project of Education of the Temple of the People"
Do you believe in Jim Jones?

101
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:37,322
"Agricultural Project of Education of the Temple of the People"

102
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:38,290
"Agricultural Project of Education of the Temple of the People"
Too much

103
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:38,390
"Agricultural Project of Education of the Temple of the People"

104
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,157
"Agricultural Project of Education of the Temple of the People"
What happened?

105
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:39,885
What happened?

106
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:42,721
This pastor of St. Francis, Jim Jones

107
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:45,319
Created a hippie church or something

108
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,265
He and his followers left San Francisco

109
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:53,929
I moved somewhere in South America

110
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,563
Where did they move? Patricia

111
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,671
- Patricia - Ghana

112
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:02,543
Is Ghana right?
Patricia That's right

113
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:06,845
In short, they all moved in and then...
My God.

114
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,449
Strange things happened, all of them...

115
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:12,648
They committed suicide, a total of 900 people

116
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:15,385
I mean, who's going to leave San Francisco?

117
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,359
Entering the jungles of South America?

118
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:19,225
Still following this type of person

119
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:24,196
He has thick hair.

120
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:27,863
Do not be funny, James.
These talents are dead.

121
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:31,170
- Just died - I know,
I just want to say...

122
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:33,403
What to say? Those people

123
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:36,379
Follow this guy from San Francisco

124
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:38,847
In the depths of the jungles of South America

125
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,886
All because he has thick hair

126
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:46,253
Yes, it is not good.

127
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,323
God, you feel very upset.
Thick hair

128
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,590
I mean...

129
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:55,894
No

130
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:58,595
James...

131
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:03,499
I am only...

132
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:12,844
You really do not like people touching you, right?

133
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:14,077
Right

134
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:17,253
I go...

135
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:18,822
I'm going to the kitchen for a glass of water.

136
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:22,348
I'm going to pour a glass of water.

137
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,552
Go ahead

138
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,361
Do you want to drink?

139
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:28,728
Okay, I also want to drink water.

140
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,969
You know, I have a sense of accomplishment today.

141
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:36,767
I thought a lot when I was walking.

142
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:44,838
So I almost finished an entire article.

143
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:46,680
I mean, do you believe that?

144
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,810
I can finish an entire hike with a walk.

145
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:52,584
I'm walking at the same time

146
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:56,391
Did you know that some people love to use the word "simultaneously"?

147
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:59,657
In the UK, people love to say at the same time

148
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:02,198
For example

149
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,895
When I ate, the phone rang.

150
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:09,865
Replace "between" with "media"

151
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:13,138
I'm eating at the same time

152
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:17,476
Between the main course and dessert, the phone rang

153
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:19,379
Yes that's right.

154
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,086
You know, I really like your photo.

155
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:26,248
Thank you, I also like it.

156
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,360
- A ship - This is a ship.

157
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:35,293
- a sailing boat -
belongs to a fleet

158
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:39,265
At sea

159
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:41,303
At sea

160
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:46,938
- Atlantic - Not the
Atlantic, James

161
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:48,910
I told you.

162
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:51,175
Do you remember what it is?

163
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:57,181
Indian Ocean

164
00:10:57,288 --> 00:10:58,118
Right

165
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:01,090
Dolphins and whales in the sea

166
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:06,195
There is also the protagonist of the beluga whale

167
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:13,135
Okay, I'll pour water.

168
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:20,309
James is full of anxiety

169
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,804
Sometimes it's very easy to leave

170
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:27,447
The simplest thing can also form a storm

171
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:29,110
Restless moment

172
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,520
Hey, do you want to use a glass or a cup of tea?

173
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,189
I want to use water when I want to put water.

174
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:40,787
High water cup

175
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:43,958
Not a cup of tea

176
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:47,937
High water cup

177
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,608
a glass of water in a tall glass of water

178
00:11:58,349 --> 00:12:03,787
Tall glass of water, not a cup of tea

179
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:10,223
I found this way from the kitchen to the living room.

180
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:15,322
Always confused me Although
crossing the kitchen aisle

181
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:20,200
It's a straight line in the living room.

182
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:23,939
The hallway still intrigues me.

183
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:28,239
It is neither a kitchen nor a living room

184
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:30,211
Only one corridor

185
00:12:30,882 --> 00:12:37,185
The hallway is between the kitchen and the living room

186
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:39,556
What happened to the hall?

187
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:46,463
Oh, it's more than it seems.

188
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:47,622
I know

189
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:51,668
This glass is for you.

190
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,896
Thank you

191
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:55,303
Give this cup to me

192
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:58,500
Go ahead

193
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,634
Thank you

194
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:02,973
Oh...

195
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:20,293
Suddenly, I felt I was not so thirsty.

196
00:13:20,398 --> 00:13:21,422
Oh...

197
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,194
I do not know

198
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:36,981
Does that make you feel better? James

199
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,075
a soft microphone dial sound

200
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:44,787
"Are you going to disappoint me?"
"You know you will."

201
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:46,717
What is going to be?

202
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:51,955
I do not know

203
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:55,651
Patricia, this is my place.

204
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:18,638
Good Morning

205
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,842
Sleep well at night?

206
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:22,545
Not bad, and you?

207
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:26,685
"Hey, you can. That's good.

208
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:30,727
I woke up at 2:38 in the morning.

209
00:15:30,828 --> 00:15:31,920
Uh

210
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:34,955
It's about 2:38 in the morning.

211
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:36,431
Or is it really 2:38?

212
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:38,764
It's 2:38 because I watched the clock.

213
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,098
OK

214
00:15:40,204 --> 00:15:41,501
Yes

215
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:43,803
How are you sleeping? Patricia

216
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:48,140
I can hear your radio on and off in my room.

217
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:50,510
- It's like a Morse password
- Okay

218
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:54,676
I turned on the radio and tried to guess.

219
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:56,651
When will the next song be played?

220
00:15:56,754 --> 00:16:00,656
But if I open it, it's an advertisement.

221
00:16:02,026 --> 00:16:05,018
So I have to turn it off.

222
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:06,027
(I.e.

223
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,529
So

224
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:11,866
It's like you're doing
something Though it's not

225
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,939
You do not turn the radio off

226
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,373
Turn the switch off, you did it at least.

227
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:22,512
Makes sense, James, Catherine is right.

228
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:25,446
So many things, at least one piece was completed.

229
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:27,644
Which one?

230
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:30,743
- Change my radio?
"That's right.

231
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:34,917
I just want to focus on writing more.

232
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:38,455
Is that you? Patricia

233
00:16:38,563 --> 00:16:41,691
I heard you turn on the radio for a while.

234
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,494
I did some work.

235
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:46,129
What work?

236
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:47,499
My work

237
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:50,440
Excuse me, what work?

238
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,566
"What are you busy with?"
- Some things about me

239
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:53,974
She also has her own business.

240
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:55,545
Some things related to notebook

241
00:16:55,646 --> 00:16:57,307
Yes I know

242
00:16:57,415 --> 00:17:01,852
I'm just wondering with what big things she's busy with.

243
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:03,750
It's these things.
- OK

244
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:10,458
What the hell is she doing?

245
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:13,428
I do not know who knows

246
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:15,996
How can anyone know?

247
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:24,637
How can anyone know?

248
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:35,542
How can anyone know?
I know it's cold.

249
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:40,321
I noticed that.

250
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:51,130
Emotion

251
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:20,092
You have a way of getting your hair matted, right?

252
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:23,062
It's a disaster.
- right

253
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:27,331
No, the hairstyle is good, very beautiful.

254
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:32,205
I just do not know where to start.

255
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:36,208
Do you think James is okay?

256
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:39,474
Why are you asking this?

257
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:44,248
I sometimes worry about him.

258
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:49,016
He is not bad

259
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:55,591
I guess

260
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:02,397
God, what happened?

261
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:12,966
Lots of pills, how many pills are there?

262
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:17,207
This is the moment At
point A, you are someone

263
00:20:17,315 --> 00:20:19,909
At point B, you are someone else.

264
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:24,283
At point C, you become another level...

265
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:29,485
Angle, fragment, field, area

266
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:31,858
James, look there.

267
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:33,624
Make sure that all of you have been picked up

268
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,931
You do not want to leave your boss angry, right?

269
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:38,763
No, I do not want this.

270
00:21:11,535 --> 00:21:15,027
Okay, how much better? James

271
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,236
Much better, much better, I can

272
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:22,812
I will not forget to pay.

273
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:25,648
Are you still inside?

274
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:30,485
You can not do this
How did you do it?

275
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:33,455
Mr. Police, he broke into my shop and made a mess.

276
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:36,219
- Who is going to pay that?
"I... I'll pay, I..."

277
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:38,693
How much will I pay?

278
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:40,627
Mr. Police, I'm sorry.

279
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:42,164
I'm your aunt.

280
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:43,893
This child... he's not very comfortable.

281
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:45,229
- In fact...
- What's his aunt?

282
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:47,201
Yes, sir, I'm your aunt.

283
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:50,433
We live very close, he is a child

284
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,509
Mr. Sanik, I'm sorry to cause you loss.

285
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,908
I promise to repay you.

286
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:57,344
Come on, I have to get him home.

287
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:11,686
Crazy, do not forget your camera.

288
00:22:12,296 --> 00:22:15,163
He's not crazy, give me the camera.

289
00:22:19,704 --> 00:22:23,071
Pay attention to your attitude, young

290
00:22:23,174 --> 00:22:24,505
You guy

291
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:30,477
You must be more careful, James.

292
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:33,675
The police can put you in jail

293
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:37,015
Honestly, I'm looking for something.

294
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:40,249
I accidentally fell, I do not know.

295
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:42,158
They are too big to make a big noise

296
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:45,786
I'm just looking for something.
Soda, soap, magazine or something.

297
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:48,194
Yes, you are looking for something, that's right.

298
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:49,994
Finding things that are all over the floor

299
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:52,865
Seriously, you can not do that.

300
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,336
Did the aspirin bottle get rid of me?

301
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,830
Or am I lost?

302
00:22:58,943 --> 00:23:02,106
And my sunglasses?
Oh, this is mine.

303
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,777
I just got to point A, has point B, so...

304
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:12,082
I do not know how to get to point C.

305
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:15,124
James, are you still in the mood to make a joke?

306
00:23:16,794 --> 00:23:19,319
Come on, I'll take you home.

307
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:24,226
Okay, sit down slowly.

308
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:26,831
You're home, okay?

309
00:23:26,937 --> 00:23:28,564
You're home, come in.

310
00:23:28,672 --> 00:23:30,196
What happened?

311
00:23:30,307 --> 00:23:31,797
What the hell is happening?
Hey, Delmar

312
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:33,137
- How are you doing?
- Catherine.

313
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:34,541
God - Where did you find Him?

314
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:36,340
- pharmacy - what?

315
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:38,574
I've always been careful

316
00:23:38,682 --> 00:23:41,150
I'm trying to buy something, you know.

317
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:44,016
Suddenly, there was a commotion in the store.

318
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:47,648
Of course, I went and explored

319
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:50,852
Then I saw this guy.

320
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:54,260
Do things all over the floor

321
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:55,525
- because?
I do not know.

322
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:56,964
Delmar, you do not need to get so ruined.

323
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:59,262
Of course he has to explain clearly, James, quiet.

324
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,830
- You are quiet.
"James, my God, James.

325
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:07,642
"You have to be more careful."
- I have that.

326
00:24:07,745 --> 00:24:11,738
Ok I just went into the store to find something.

327
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:15,910
"Then I lost."
"Yes, you are lost, very well.

328
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,045
The pharmacy has never been so confusing.

329
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:19,747
"Really."

330
00:24:19,857 --> 00:24:21,688
I'm flying forward.

331
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:25,489
Thunder can not help saving it.

332
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:28,030
So, how did you do it?

333
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:32,068
This is the case, I said I'm your aunt

334
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:36,003
I do my best to keep you from the store.

335
00:24:36,106 --> 00:24:37,539
I do not know why she's an aunt.

336
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:39,541
It does not matter, it does not matter anyway.

337
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:42,840
I have your help, thank you.

338
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,148
I suggest you do not stay near the pharmacy for now.

339
00:24:50,254 --> 00:24:52,017
Otherwise, the police officer will find you here.

340
00:24:52,122 --> 00:24:54,022
"I will not be surprised.
- Police?

341
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:57,025
Yes, Mr. Sanik, he is very angry.

342
00:24:58,262 --> 00:25:00,526
Did your sunglasses pay for it?

343
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,861
- Really - James

344
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:06,937
You know, it's all that damn novel.

345
00:25:07,037 --> 00:25:09,005
- what?
- it is not? Catherine

346
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:10,937
All because of the damn soap

347
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:11,939
James

348
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:14,476
When did you go to the store to buy soap?

349
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:15,806
- No - That's...

350
00:25:16,413 --> 00:25:18,176
He's not talking about a piece of soap.

351
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:20,216
He is referring to novel

352
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:25,485
Do not blame me for being rude, Delmar

353
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:27,420
You do not even know what you're talking about.

354
00:25:27,858 --> 00:25:33,228
- I stopped, I stopped - James,
do not speak loudly with Delmar.

355
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,661
I'm not getting fired.

356
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:36,858
But I do not want to talk now, can I?

357
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:38,366
I do not want to talk about soap.

358
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:40,528
- old age - a year ago

359
00:25:40,638 --> 00:25:42,230
A year ago things were old.

360
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:43,363
That's right.

361
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:47,010
Whether you are fired or not, this is not a key point.

362
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:49,409
You are a great actor

363
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:55,351
Among these crazy
plots Enjoy the magic

364
00:25:55,452 --> 00:25:57,647
- Your performance is not really covered.
"That's right.

365
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:59,017
In between

366
00:25:59,623 --> 00:26:01,614
What?

367
00:26:01,725 --> 00:26:05,126
You said that word.
He likes that word.

368
00:26:05,229 --> 00:26:07,060
I said that? Does he like this?

369
00:26:07,164 --> 00:26:07,994
What he likes?

370
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:09,895
Between that word?
- Yes.

371
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,989
No

372
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:12,591
I do not like that word.

373
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:15,695
I just found out that people like
to say 'Cause no one said that

374
00:26:15,806 --> 00:26:16,830
OK

375
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:18,238
At least they do not usually say that word

376
00:26:19,276 --> 00:26:22,507
As I just said, your performance is great.

377
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:23,409
That's right.

378
00:26:23,514 --> 00:26:25,675
You left the day when I was limp.

379
00:26:25,783 --> 00:26:27,410
- Watching, after 40 years
- I watched, after 40 years

380
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:29,042
I know...

381
00:26:29,153 --> 00:26:30,882
"I've heard you speaking hundreds of times.
James

382
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:35,819
I'm still grateful to you, Delmar.

383
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:38,986
But I still do not want to talk about it, can I?

384
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:40,563
I will not act again.

385
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:43,357
I'm writing a book? I'm a writer

386
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:45,401
Right

387
00:26:45,502 --> 00:26:47,800
I'm tired, okay?
- OK

388
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:49,338
I'm like this because I'm tired.

389
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,668
OK

390
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:54,511
But really, James, they should not let you go.

391
00:26:56,413 --> 00:26:58,881
I swear I'll never look at the novel again.

392
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:01,281
What good looks are there without your game?

393
00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:03,250
It's very good

394
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,886
The boss crushed everything on the floor.

395
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:18,632
The crowd dissipated

396
00:27:18,736 --> 00:27:19,998
Dissipate?

397
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,070
The crowd left

398
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:27,871
Who are you calling? James

399
00:27:30,214 --> 00:27:31,442
Did not call anyone.

400
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,082
Who's he talking to?

401
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:53,763
Symmetry

402
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:55,967
I do not know if it's so real.

403
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:01,209
I thought it would be worse.

404
00:28:02,846 --> 00:28:05,713
In my life, my life.

405
00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:07,215
Never was...

406
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:11,385
Such humiliation

407
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:53,058
This is the thing you do not want to say.

408
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:56,023
And now I'm constantly squatting

409
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,327
What happened? James

410
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:27,327
Like tonight?

411
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:32,367
- Can you hear? James
- Sure I Can Hear

412
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,873
I think this seems to be broken.

413
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:44,379
The phone is not bad, James.

414
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:47,547
Try to focus on it and focus on your work.

415
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,494
All I can do is listen.

416
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:03,032
Do not feel so slow, do not be so slow

417
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:05,466
I want to write.

418
00:30:56,286 --> 00:30:57,480
Never enough

419
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:01,957
It's really impressive, this weapon...

420
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:05,324
No witness testimony This
is really scaring me.

421
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:07,226
Yes, that's not exactly my choice.

422
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:10,698
Scared me, if I try?

423
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:20,706
Hey, Jason, I got to see you again.

424
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:23,110
I will contact him at the time and place.

425
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:26,444
One person, without weapons, without support

426
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:31,886
They can come closer I'll be
a little bit farther away.

427
00:31:32,856 --> 00:31:34,346
That's how I handle things.

428
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:39,219
Too late

429
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:42,463
Look, my girlfriend is so troublesome.

430
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:45,126
Resist me, you know what I'm thinking?

431
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:49,430
I think we can get along.

432
00:31:58,081 --> 00:31:59,309
I do not know who you are.

433
00:31:59,883 --> 00:32:01,817
I do not know you at all.

434
00:32:02,653 --> 00:32:03,483
Who are you

435
00:32:03,587 --> 00:32:06,078
"At point A, you're somebody.
- I do not know you.

436
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:16,729
"Listen, do not tell vampires.
"At point B, you're somebody else.

437
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,425
This is getting on well with me...

438
00:32:18,535 --> 00:32:20,366
- The oldest person
ever - at point C

439
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,732
Vampire

440
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:28,378
Another level, angle, fragment, field, area

441
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:34,511
James?

442
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:49,730
James?
(I.e.

443
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:51,858
What happened? Are you alright?

444
00:32:54,304 --> 00:32:55,794
God.

445
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:03,609
"Is it enough to pull
today?" James - right

446
00:33:03,714 --> 00:33:07,309
Dressed like a man, Catherine

447
00:33:08,118 --> 00:33:11,212
I know it's her, but it's a bit confusing.

448
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:15,314
Let me help you with your hair, okay?
I'll help you comb your hair.

449
00:33:17,394 --> 00:33:20,192
Why do you look so worried?

450
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:21,787
It's me.

451
00:33:21,898 --> 00:33:26,358
Quick, James, ask her.
You know it's Catherine.

452
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,529
It's hidden somewhere in there, right?

453
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,132
Must be com...

454
00:33:32,242 --> 00:33:35,336
- It does not matter -
related to your ear

455
00:33:36,146 --> 00:33:37,443
My ears?

456
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:40,248
Which ear?

457
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,217
- your right ear -
your right ear?

458
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:45,748
What happened to my right ear?

459
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:48,324
I do not know, but it caught my interest.

460
00:33:48,425 --> 00:33:49,653
When it started?

461
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,320
For a while but I do not want to tell you

462
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:53,919
- Do you know...
James

463
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:56,295
"It's too long today."
"It is not her ears that confuse you.

464
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,868
You must know how my ears are not

465
00:33:58,969 --> 00:34:00,596
Not her ear.

466
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:03,002
Okay, you have the final say.

467
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:05,301
Your ears are nothing, James.

468
00:34:10,347 --> 00:34:12,872
Come and feel

469
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:18,013
Feel this ear, right ear, James

470
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:20,087
Left ear

471
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:22,151
The same

472
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,791
Symmetry

473
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,997
Hey look

474
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:32,028
Wait a minute, hello?

475
00:34:32,936 --> 00:34:34,028
Hello

476
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:38,704
Look, I hear the phone with my ears.
No problem

477
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,270
Yes

478
00:34:42,345 --> 00:34:43,778
Please wait a moment.

479
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,481
I want to meet you.

480
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:50,677
Good

481
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:57,553
I'll be back soon, listen.

482
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:19,836
Something that does not exist
somewhere Later it existed again

483
00:36:32,923 --> 00:36:33,855
Early

484
00:36:33,957 --> 00:36:35,219
(I.e.
- How are you doing?

485
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:39,560
What do you think?
I'm busy with these.

486
00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:43,224
Quick, I've been doing this all night.

487
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:48,126
Good Morning

488
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,735
Can you go to other smoking rooms?

489
00:36:53,476 --> 00:36:54,738
You can

490
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:56,334
When did you start pumping?

491
00:36:57,113 --> 00:36:58,444
Occasionally

492
00:36:59,015 --> 00:37:02,542
This is not the answer. When did I ask you to start?

493
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:05,780
I'm not asking how often do you get it?

494
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:07,857
I just smoked in other rooms.

495
00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:15,454
OK forget it.

496
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:18,261
Do you like it? These are...

497
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:21,804
These are psychiatrists in
the 50's Inkblot test drawn

498
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:24,100
I think these pictures are very good.

499
00:37:24,207 --> 00:37:25,834
- It is?
Yes.

500
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:27,068
Thank you

501
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:30,908
You know, I always thought

502
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:33,779
And I have an idea to tell you

503
00:37:33,883 --> 00:37:35,111
Really

504
00:37:35,685 --> 00:37:39,177
Think, think about this photo, you have an idea.

505
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:43,783
I'm thinking, hey, about my book.

506
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:45,986
- So what?
"You know about my job.

507
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:49,725
How much effort was paid

508
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,358
How much time was invested?

509
00:37:53,036 --> 00:37:55,527
Three hours there, eight hours there.

510
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:57,800
Ten o'clock here, you know, it's crazy.

511
00:37:57,907 --> 00:37:59,807
- Right. It's crazy.

512
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:01,433
Yes.
- then...

513
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:07,146
If I put my text and your painting...

514
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,522
It's art, right? Not only...

515
00:38:14,624 --> 00:38:19,027
My work plus your
work All this is art

516
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:24,226
Art, art, all fictitious

517
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:26,131
All of nothing

518
00:38:26,236 --> 00:38:28,568
You know I mean, fictitious

519
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:34,006
So... it's there.

520
00:38:34,744 --> 00:38:37,144
Really like

521
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:40,016
- Nothing, nothing

522
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:45,750
Yes, yes, I mean that.

523
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:51,851
Because it's like something that does not exist somewhere.

524
00:38:51,961 --> 00:38:54,486
Later there was again The main
character of the white whale

525
00:38:55,031 --> 00:39:00,025
One day, many days, there were no white whales at the time.

526
00:39:00,537 --> 00:39:05,099
Without white whales, then scream

527
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,438
The white whale appeared Yes.

528
00:39:07,544 --> 00:39:10,206
There is and will always be

529
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:14,807
But one day the white whale disappeared suddenly.

530
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:17,580
Yes, but you just mentioned

531
00:39:17,687 --> 00:39:24,058
Equivalent to a Heavy Load, James

532
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:29,458
Do not we have a picture like that?

533
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:32,000
Is there such a painting in your house?

534
00:39:32,736 --> 00:39:34,203
Yes, similar

535
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:39,873
Great

536
00:39:42,312 --> 00:39:46,373
This requires an artist
Created by the artist

537
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:49,316
Yes.
- Everything needs to be created

538
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,180
You need to trust someone's hands.

539
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:55,023
We've known each other a long time, right?

540
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:57,685
- Right - We are very
familiar with each other

541
00:39:57,794 --> 00:40:01,321
Know each other's creations, trust each other

542
00:40:01,431 --> 00:40:02,591
Yes

543
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:04,530
- It is?
- Yes

544
00:40:04,634 --> 00:40:08,400
Okay, what if I'm dead?

545
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:11,630
- what?
"I'm not saying that kind of death.

546
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:14,005
I just said, in case, I'm dead.

547
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,704
What if I get out and pressed down the tree?

548
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:18,474
Or was it hit by a car?

549
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:22,745
I left the world, but the work is not over yet.

550
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:24,752
I mean, things are still there.

551
00:40:24,854 --> 00:40:28,688
Completed 75%

552
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:35,197
Or 80% or 70%

553
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:37,528
Just put there

554
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:40,398
No one will finish more, it is a semi-finished product.

555
00:40:40,503 --> 00:40:43,028
- 70% completed - Completed 70%

556
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:45,539
You are crazy?

557
00:40:45,642 --> 00:40:47,200
No

558
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,574
Hi everybody, where did the people go?

559
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:50,737
James

560
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:52,678
We're here, hey, Delmar

561
00:40:52,782 --> 00:40:55,376
Good morning, the bell does not ring.

562
00:40:55,485 --> 00:40:56,417
excuse me

563
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:58,851
Not so asked, but...

564
00:40:58,955 --> 00:41:00,946
Can you lend me some sugar? I'm baking bread

565
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:02,081
- Catherine - Of course...

566
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:04,456
- What is it?
"Is not the work over yet?"

567
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:05,858
- Ok - So, when I
go back west...

568
00:41:05,962 --> 00:41:08,829
You should do this first.

569
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:11,127
Okay. This is what I want to tell you.

570
00:41:11,234 --> 00:41:13,464
Back to the West?

571
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,060
- my God.
- Then...

572
00:41:16,873 --> 00:41:18,363
I'm so glad you're here, Delmar.

573
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:19,499
Please, sit down.

574
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:22,505
We are discussing something very important.

575
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:26,810
I suggest Catherine make an appointment with me.

576
00:41:28,585 --> 00:41:30,883
Oh, that's...

577
00:41:30,987 --> 00:41:34,184
- A secret agreement - No,
this is not a secret.

578
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:39,227
It's a simple arrangement.
Then I'm back in the West.

579
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:41,889
I hope you have finished my book.

580
00:41:42,532 --> 00:41:47,196
If you die first, I'll help you complete the paintings and sculptures.

581
00:41:52,075 --> 00:41:55,738
"Okay, James, are you really talking?"
- Of course

582
00:41:55,845 --> 00:41:58,609
"Have you heard of this agreement?"
I will meet

583
00:41:58,715 --> 00:42:00,649
Just for safety

584
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:04,277
Know that after evaporating

585
00:42:04,387 --> 00:42:09,120
The work can still be completed
It will make me feel better

586
00:42:09,225 --> 00:42:11,318
This is really interesting.

587
00:42:11,427 --> 00:42:14,828
- Thank you, Delmar.
- It's all right.

588
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:16,626
So, how do we sign up?

589
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:19,599
Are you... going to leave a message for me?

590
00:42:19,702 --> 00:42:22,728
Do you want the book to be published?

591
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,940
Which of the author's photos should I put?

592
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:29,107
The details are pretty

593
00:42:29,212 --> 00:42:32,375
It's really very

594
00:42:32,482 --> 00:42:34,507
In fact, it's not that complicated.

595
00:42:34,617 --> 00:42:36,642
- I'll be at work...
- very good

596
00:42:36,753 --> 00:42:38,721
Leave some words, okay?

597
00:42:38,821 --> 00:42:42,382
As for the author's photo, it's no big deal.

598
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:44,119
I mean...

599
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:49,428
I still use your pictures, I do not care.

600
00:42:49,532 --> 00:42:53,593
I do not even think about it, my picture.

601
00:42:53,703 --> 00:42:54,897
I think about it.

602
00:42:55,004 --> 00:42:56,301
What should I do?

603
00:42:56,406 --> 00:42:57,930
Should I put my hair up?

604
00:42:58,041 --> 00:43:03,638
Still down?
I should have been sitting in danger...

605
00:43:03,746 --> 00:43:04,940
Or if you have nothing to sit on?

606
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:09,280
The author's photo is not the essence of the job, okay?

607
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:11,945
"It's not the kind of agreement you want.
OK.

608
00:43:12,055 --> 00:43:13,716
- not related to the author's photo
- Catherine

609
00:43:13,823 --> 00:43:15,120
As?
If i am you

610
00:43:15,224 --> 00:43:18,523
I'm going to comb my hair to the side.

611
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,761
Yes, yes, that would be...

612
00:43:22,865 --> 00:43:25,356
So you can be in your ear...

613
00:43:25,468 --> 00:43:29,131
Connect a flower and wear a headscarf

614
00:43:29,238 --> 00:43:32,639
- The handkerchief looks beautiful.
- The two suggestions are great

615
00:43:32,742 --> 00:43:36,508
Do not worry, just point it, okay?

616
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:37,739
OK

617
00:43:39,215 --> 00:43:40,147
OK

618
00:43:40,249 --> 00:43:43,946
This project is incredible, but James.

619
00:43:44,053 --> 00:43:45,213
You really think too much.

620
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:47,380
A rich and healthy life is waiting for you ahead.

621
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,855
- Catherine - What is this?

622
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:53,054
If I were you, I'd take a picture like that.

623
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,432
OK

624
00:43:58,534 --> 00:43:59,933
Patricia?

625
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:01,936
It does not matter which author photo

626
00:44:03,806 --> 00:44:05,433
You know, your face.

627
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:09,637
No matter what angle is a good photo

628
00:44:09,746 --> 00:44:12,306
After all, you're an actor, James.

629
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,315
I used to be an actor.

630
00:44:14,817 --> 00:44:18,685
I'm not an actor anymore.
I am now a writer, Delmar.

631
00:44:18,788 --> 00:44:20,949
- I do not act, I write an article.
- OK

632
00:44:21,858 --> 00:44:24,190
"Take this, Delma.
- OK

633
00:44:24,293 --> 00:44:26,090
I think I should get out.

634
00:44:26,195 --> 00:44:28,163
I just got in and got some sugar.

635
00:44:28,264 --> 00:44:29,697
"I have the sugar I want."
- Take it.

636
00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:30,458
Thank you, Catherine.

637
00:44:30,566 --> 00:44:32,796
You are welcome to come and sit at any time.

638
00:44:32,902 --> 00:44:34,199
Thank you

639
00:44:34,804 --> 00:44:36,863
Goodbye, you beautiful student.

640
00:44:38,574 --> 00:44:40,633
Thank you.
- toasted bread gently

641
00:44:40,743 --> 00:44:42,005
Hey, Delmar

642
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,738
- You can bake and pick it up again.
James

643
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,278
I have absolute confidence in you.

644
00:44:47,383 --> 00:44:48,748
You can complete your own novel

645
00:44:48,851 --> 00:44:49,783
So?

646
00:44:49,886 --> 00:44:53,287
You know This deal can be beneficial to me.

647
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:57,291
Although I have not drawn up any plans to die

648
00:44:57,393 --> 00:45:00,920
However, you can definitely interpret an image

649
00:45:02,331 --> 00:45:06,995
For example, look at this photo and tell me

650
00:45:07,103 --> 00:45:09,503
What do you see

651
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:14,440
Is it a wall and a floor?

652
00:45:14,544 --> 00:45:16,512
It's the wall and the floor.

653
00:45:16,612 --> 00:45:21,208
I actually thought so when I was drawing last night.

654
00:45:21,317 --> 00:45:22,841
Very observant

655
00:45:22,952 --> 00:45:25,216
What I saw was the ink on the paper.

656
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:27,716
You have to admire her.

657
00:45:27,824 --> 00:45:29,815
This is the ink on the paper.

658
00:45:31,427 --> 00:45:32,655
Very good, Patricia

659
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:35,260
Hey, how about taking a ride?

660
00:45:35,364 --> 00:45:36,456
Get out of this room?

661
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:37,999
Okay, I want to go.

662
00:45:38,101 --> 00:45:39,966
"Patricia, what about you?"
- do not do

663
00:45:41,704 --> 00:45:42,693
Only you

664
00:47:44,227 --> 00:47:45,558
I'll find Delmar.

665
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:58,367
Delmar

666
00:47:58,474 --> 00:48:03,639
I'm coming to you to go to our house to eat apple pie.

667
00:48:03,746 --> 00:48:05,873
Come in, James, come in quickly.

668
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:07,040
Log in

669
00:48:10,152 --> 00:48:11,176
Patricia

670
00:48:15,658 --> 00:48:16,750
God

671
00:48:18,794 --> 00:48:20,625
- How are you doing?
- Not bad

672
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,628
What are you doing?

673
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:25,428
I'm going to a soap opera that's broadcasting you.

674
00:48:25,968 --> 00:48:28,061
No, I'm not watching.

675
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,263
I mean, since you left

676
00:48:30,373 --> 00:48:31,772
"I do not watch anymore.
- Does not matter

677
00:48:31,874 --> 00:48:33,307
Anything

678
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:35,343
You should...
You can watch

679
00:48:35,444 --> 00:48:36,502
Hey, you should watch

680
00:48:36,612 --> 00:48:38,637
I mean, this is a good show.

681
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:41,080
Even without my participation

682
00:48:42,451 --> 00:48:43,816
Does not matter

683
00:49:11,814 --> 00:49:14,715
Is that a replay? It seems to be a long time ago

684
00:49:14,817 --> 00:49:19,880
This station is often broadcast in the middle of the night.

685
00:49:19,989 --> 00:49:23,220
And often not in order

686
00:49:23,326 --> 00:49:24,987
If you are not the number one fan

687
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:28,291
I do not understand what the show is doing.

688
00:49:30,232 --> 00:49:31,927
There is no reason for this.

689
00:49:33,302 --> 00:49:36,237
This is a novel, it is telling stories.

690
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:38,330
- Why do you still want...
I know

691
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:39,931
- Look at the old one?
I know

692
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:48,307
I've seen every episode before you get fired.

693
00:49:48,417 --> 00:49:49,975
Leave, I quit.

694
00:49:50,086 --> 00:49:51,075
Yes, that's what I mean.

695
00:49:51,187 --> 00:49:55,715
At that time, you quit the game.

696
00:49:55,825 --> 00:49:57,292
That's right.

697
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:05,232
Hey, you want to... eat some apple pies?

698
00:50:05,334 --> 00:50:08,201
Catherine just shopped with me.

699
00:50:08,304 --> 00:50:11,535
I'm going to be a party and I want to invite you into the past.

700
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:13,767
That's great.
- OK

701
00:50:13,876 --> 00:50:16,936
Okay, let me get you a shawl.

702
00:50:17,046 --> 00:50:20,345
Just next

703
00:50:25,621 --> 00:50:27,282
I killed a man in Tribeca.

704
00:50:28,491 --> 00:50:29,753
Watching him die

705
00:50:33,195 --> 00:50:35,356
I do not have a bad feeling.

706
00:50:36,832 --> 00:50:38,766
I turned into art

707
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:40,703
Never stopped

708
00:50:40,703 --> 00:50:41,470
People do not understand how sensitive others are.
Never stopped

709
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:43,072
People do not understand how sensitive others are.

710
00:50:43,072 --> 00:50:45,775
People do not understand how sensitive others are.
Yeah, I got home last night.

711
00:50:45,775 --> 00:50:49,176
Enter the restaurant and open the chandelier.

712
00:50:50,246 --> 00:50:52,714
There's a picture of my inkblot on the wall.

713
00:50:52,815 --> 00:50:54,612
She is scrawled up

714
00:50:54,717 --> 00:50:57,083
- what?
- Is so

715
00:50:57,186 --> 00:51:00,986
She has a meaningless doodle.

716
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,183
And this is a photo that I really like.

717
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:05,453
I originally wanted to get him.
Was ruined by her

718
00:51:24,947 --> 00:51:27,006
You know, I've been...

719
00:51:27,116 --> 00:51:31,644
Use a new stationery in the study

720
00:51:31,754 --> 00:51:32,982
For my writing

721
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,488
It is? What is it?

722
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,956
Do you know how much I love using ink pens?

723
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:39,892
Three cups of coffee, thank you.

724
00:51:39,995 --> 00:51:40,893
I know

725
00:51:40,996 --> 00:51:42,759
Signature pen and microphone pen

726
00:51:42,865 --> 00:51:44,628
Uh

727
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:50,365
I started... using... pencils

728
00:51:50,473 --> 00:51:51,872
You do not hate pencils.

729
00:51:51,974 --> 00:51:53,339
Yes I know

730
00:51:53,442 --> 00:51:55,376
I still have an ink pen in use.

731
00:51:55,478 --> 00:52:00,438
But the pencil can do this without the ink pen.

732
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:02,744
First of all, your ink will not run out

733
00:52:03,786 --> 00:52:08,246
Secondly, your punches are very good.

734
00:52:08,357 --> 00:52:14,023
The pencil is so interesting that I tried to use it.

735
00:52:14,563 --> 00:52:18,363
"You know, physical
effort." "That's right.

736
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:21,402
You can feel the touch

737
00:52:21,804 --> 00:52:24,830
I really feel that work efficiency has improved.

738
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:31,675
Real work, have fun and...

739
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:36,649
Better yet, if you made a mistake

740
00:52:36,752 --> 00:52:40,916
Can be canceled with a rubber

741
00:52:41,023 --> 00:52:46,689
The only remaining crumbs of rubber

742
00:52:46,795 --> 00:52:48,786
"Strange things happened.
"I do not know what it would be like.

743
00:52:48,898 --> 00:52:51,264
While it explodes, it's gone.

744
00:52:51,367 --> 00:52:55,770
So the whole piece of paper is brand new.

745
00:52:55,871 --> 00:52:57,532
"You can start from scratch
too." "That's right.

746
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,301
So the pencil is really god.

747
00:52:59,408 --> 00:53:02,673
Curiously

748
00:53:02,778 --> 00:53:04,803
Yes, efficiency artifact

749
00:53:05,881 --> 00:53:10,011
Right? I really do not understand why you...

750
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:13,282
I always love simplifying, James

751
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:15,448
Why do not you use an ink pen?

752
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:20,021
Have you passed? Just use an ink pen

753
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:21,357
Right

754
00:53:23,332 --> 00:53:24,629
- Right James?

755
00:53:25,568 --> 00:53:28,935
I'll continue to use the ink pen.
I went to the bathroom.

756
00:53:33,676 --> 00:53:35,769
Why do you scrawl my paintings?

757
00:53:35,878 --> 00:53:37,539
I like it.
- What do you like?

758
00:53:37,613 --> 00:53:41,140
Do you like my painting or do you like to destroy it?

759
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:45,084
I did not hurt, I was painting.
I added the painting

760
00:53:46,322 --> 00:53:49,519
If you are so interested in art

761
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:53,584
Glad to provide you with ink and paper.

762
00:53:53,696 --> 00:53:57,291
How do you want to practice?

763
00:53:57,399 --> 00:54:01,665
But you should not practice on other people's paintings.

764
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:03,897
Whether you know it or not

765
00:54:04,006 --> 00:54:05,564
Your behavior is really provocative.

766
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,870
I just told Patricia.

767
00:54:12,982 --> 00:54:15,177
She should not destroy my paintings

768
00:54:16,952 --> 00:54:22,049
I will not say that she is "doing destruction"

769
00:54:22,157 --> 00:54:23,146
Are not you going to tell?

770
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,988
What do you say? This is my job

771
00:54:25,094 --> 00:54:27,858
If it spoils your article

772
00:54:27,963 --> 00:54:31,364
You'll be furious, James.

773
00:54:31,467 --> 00:54:34,061
I know, I'm not breastfeeding her.

774
00:54:34,169 --> 00:54:37,536
I just said...

775
00:54:38,474 --> 00:54:41,568
Patricia is like this

776
00:54:43,979 --> 00:54:49,246
What you spoil is a painting that I like very much.

777
00:54:55,724 --> 00:55:01,754
Hey, you just said you're using a new piece of paper.

778
00:55:01,864 --> 00:55:03,263
- a new design role -
No, I did not say that.

779
00:55:03,365 --> 00:55:05,390
I said I'm using a different color of paper.

780
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:06,160
(I.e.

781
00:55:06,268 --> 00:55:08,793
Just a different color of paper

782
00:55:08,904 --> 00:55:12,396
It's a creamy tone

783
00:55:12,508 --> 00:55:13,770
- grayish Yes.

784
00:55:13,876 --> 00:55:15,901
I'm also starting to draw the character

785
00:55:16,011 --> 00:55:19,777
Better than standing up You
can not find it at all.

786
00:55:22,251 --> 00:55:26,051
Ah, that's the way it is.

787
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:29,682
I was thinking... maybe you did not draw well.

788
00:55:30,392 --> 00:55:35,329
Because it seems... a
little Not very positive

789
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,595
My character is not correct?

790
00:55:49,078 --> 00:55:51,012
Oh my God

791
00:55:57,019 --> 00:55:58,816
Do you know Catherine?

792
00:55:58,921 --> 00:56:05,121
Sometimes you dress like a man.

793
00:56:06,462 --> 00:56:09,124
I'm confused. I know, James.

794
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:13,793
I know sometimes you'll be confused about what's in front of you.

795
00:56:13,902 --> 00:56:15,369
But it's me

796
00:56:15,938 --> 00:56:18,998
Whenever I see you dressed as a man
You will feel very much like costumes

797
00:56:19,108 --> 00:56:23,442
- It looks very pretentious.
- Is that it?

798
00:56:24,113 --> 00:56:27,514
Looks like a fantasy, very fake

799
00:56:27,616 --> 00:56:30,380
The garrison does not apply here, Patricia

800
00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:31,510
- You are here...
- you should not use that word

801
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,053
Patricia, how do you say that?

802
00:56:33,155 --> 00:56:37,057
I do not know, I'm just Not
yet accustomed to her dress

803
00:56:39,228 --> 00:56:44,928
So whenever I wear this dress
Do you think I'm such a clown?

804
00:56:45,033 --> 00:56:48,400
Did you think so in your heart?

805
00:56:48,504 --> 00:56:50,768
You seem to be wearing a costume.

806
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:58,307
Okay, God.

807
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:01,713
It's really a lot of speculation tonight, right?

808
00:57:02,951 --> 00:57:06,512
Honestly, this is really hurting feelings.

809
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:12,386
Patricia, I do my best to take care of your brother.

810
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:16,328
Taking care of him because he cares for him

811
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,832
I have to try my best to care about you.

812
00:57:18,934 --> 00:57:22,097
"I have to take care of you."
Catherine

813
00:57:22,204 --> 00:57:27,164
I'll do it because I care about your brother.
My good friend

814
00:57:27,276 --> 00:57:32,737
And when you sit here, it makes me feel uncomfortable.

815
00:57:32,848 --> 00:57:36,784
I mean, if I want to leave home

816
00:57:36,885 --> 00:57:42,323
Dress like a half-tone man with a beard

817
00:57:42,424 --> 00:57:44,187
I have a good performance

818
00:57:44,293 --> 00:57:47,160
These are not difficult, I can do that.

819
00:57:47,262 --> 00:57:50,857
But the person who questioned me is actually...

820
00:57:50,966 --> 00:57:55,096
It's too much for you to live with me under one roof.

821
00:57:55,204 --> 00:57:56,569
- It's hurting a lot.
Catherine

822
00:57:56,672 --> 00:57:58,970
It's all because of your mental illness, I mean...

823
00:57:59,074 --> 00:58:02,737
If you have a mental illness, you will forget.

824
00:58:02,845 --> 00:58:07,839
Acceptable, at least true
And what is my calculation?

825
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:12,853
I'm pretentious, but a clown.

826
00:58:12,955 --> 00:58:14,650
It's simply a buzzword.

827
00:58:14,756 --> 00:58:16,348
I do not know what I'm talking about.

828
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:18,824
I am not mentally ill, there is no such thing.

829
00:58:18,927 --> 00:58:22,988
I'm just a person who wants to dress like a man.

830
00:58:23,098 --> 00:58:24,292
It is

831
00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:31,636
excuse me

832
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,571
As?
- That's... Mr.

833
00:58:33,675 --> 00:58:35,939
Can you turn down the volume?
You scared my baby.

834
00:58:36,044 --> 00:58:39,070
Your baby is also scared.
You should be whispering.

835
00:58:40,415 --> 00:58:44,442
This is a place for family gatherings.

836
00:58:44,553 --> 00:58:48,922
There is a group of perverted places to expose each other

837
00:58:49,024 --> 00:58:51,424
I'll give you a suggestion, sir, sit down.

838
00:58:55,864 --> 00:59:00,096
Really disgusting, transsexual

839
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:44,674
Do not let your tears fall

840
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:10,501
I have an old neighbor

841
01:00:11,506 --> 01:00:15,738
He is always a woman at age 65.

842
01:00:15,844 --> 01:00:20,679
He has long gray hair
Wearing strange glasses

843
01:00:20,782 --> 01:00:24,149
I always love wearing a skirt, stepping on high heels

844
01:00:25,253 --> 01:00:29,155
But he's obviously a man, obviously

845
01:00:29,925 --> 01:00:31,415
Do you remember our neighbor? Patricia

846
01:00:31,526 --> 01:00:33,050
- That man?
- remember if

847
01:00:33,161 --> 01:00:35,425
What are you doing now? James

848
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:39,227
I do not know, I just remembered him coming.

849
01:00:39,334 --> 01:00:43,532
Our neighbor is very strong

850
01:00:44,139 --> 01:00:47,597
This old man in disguise

851
01:00:48,243 --> 01:00:50,677
I mean, let go.

852
01:00:50,779 --> 01:00:54,510
He's ready to fight for a long time.

853
01:00:54,616 --> 01:01:01,454
I used to think he should be...

854
01:01:01,556 --> 01:01:05,287
The strongest and most powerful person in the world

855
01:01:05,394 --> 01:01:07,624
Very strong, got it?

856
01:01:07,729 --> 01:01:10,664
Dressed like a woman in a community like that at the time

857
01:01:10,766 --> 01:01:13,667
What is needed is unparalleled determination and perseverance

858
01:01:13,769 --> 01:01:18,001
I used to track him.

859
01:01:18,106 --> 01:01:20,836
Just watching him

860
01:01:20,942 --> 01:01:23,843
People see the reaction of their walk

861
01:01:27,716 --> 01:01:32,050
I'm sorry to ruin your paintings, Catherine.

862
01:01:35,891 --> 01:01:37,984
Her neighbor, the "woman"

863
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,825
Have you talked to him yet? James

864
01:01:42,397 --> 01:01:44,024
No, I hope to have

865
01:01:45,167 --> 01:01:47,635
Only people are very sensitive

866
01:01:47,736 --> 01:01:49,067
You know, people do not understand.

867
01:01:49,171 --> 01:01:52,698
Others do not understand how sensitive people are.

868
01:01:52,808 --> 01:01:53,672
They just do not understand

869
01:01:53,775 --> 01:01:55,970
So I have to be arrogant to others.

870
01:01:56,078 --> 01:01:57,204
Who are you talking about?

871
01:01:57,312 --> 01:01:59,803
Anyone can

872
01:02:09,591 --> 01:02:10,615
get up

873
01:02:12,627 --> 01:02:18,497
Let's go home.
Come on, James.

874
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,999
Come on, Patricia.

875
01:02:33,014 --> 01:02:37,041
After all, you have experienced your own life.

876
01:02:50,198 --> 01:02:51,358
(I.e.

877
01:02:51,466 --> 01:02:52,433
Hello Delmar

878
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:54,331
- What are you doing?
Anything.

879
01:02:54,436 --> 01:02:57,928
I just want to come and say hello.

880
01:02:58,039 --> 01:03:00,337
A person feels a little alone at home, you know

881
01:03:00,442 --> 01:03:01,704
Right

882
01:03:04,813 --> 01:03:06,144
What are you busy with? James

883
01:03:06,248 --> 01:03:09,308
"Are you writing your book?"
Yes.

884
01:03:09,417 --> 01:03:11,510
Hey, you're very talented.

885
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,982
When can I read your masterpiece?

886
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:19,652
To be honest, I'm fed up with fear.

887
01:03:20,128 --> 01:03:21,356
I look forward to nothing more than a book...

888
01:03:21,463 --> 01:03:23,931
Autographed printed book only

889
01:03:24,933 --> 01:03:26,332
The first will be left for you.

890
01:03:28,737 --> 01:03:31,262
Do you mind if I sit next to you?

891
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:32,806
With you?

892
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:36,469
"Do not worry, please, sit down.
- very good

893
01:03:37,245 --> 01:03:38,269
Very good

894
01:03:40,115 --> 01:03:43,243
I have a crossword puzzle to come

895
01:03:43,351 --> 01:03:45,876
I always carry this with me.

896
01:03:45,987 --> 01:03:48,820
Who knows when inspiration will appear

897
01:04:08,877 --> 01:04:14,611
Six letters, meaning not here

898
01:04:19,754 --> 01:04:20,812
Absent

899
01:04:26,761 --> 01:04:29,924
Away, you know? Do you know...

900
01:04:30,031 --> 01:04:33,432
Where is this house attractive?

901
01:04:34,135 --> 01:04:36,330
Hey you two

902
01:04:36,438 --> 01:04:41,068
You and Catherine have chosen a creative life.

903
01:04:41,176 --> 01:04:42,438
This is really...

904
01:04:43,345 --> 01:04:47,748
Honestly, she's drawing here.

905
01:04:47,849 --> 01:04:53,116
You can play in your novels

906
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:54,711
Right

907
01:04:54,823 --> 01:04:57,053
It's a very new thing for me.

908
01:05:00,295 --> 01:05:03,992
I've always been a bit jealous of the two of you.

909
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:07,432
And the decisions you made for yourself

910
01:05:07,535 --> 01:05:10,470
About this creative life

911
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:31,090
But the world is different now.

912
01:05:33,862 --> 01:05:38,731
The world is full of vitality

913
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:42,166
Open and so wonderful

914
01:05:43,672 --> 01:05:47,540
If I have the chance to start over, start over.

915
01:05:47,642 --> 01:05:50,543
I dare say I will definitely...

916
01:05:50,645 --> 01:05:54,877
Developing for the act
of acting Like you

917
01:05:56,818 --> 01:06:00,652
I really want to have the opportunity to try and act and tell stories.

918
01:06:00,755 --> 01:06:05,385
You know, temporarily withdrawing

919
01:06:11,433 --> 01:06:19,204
You know, the world is not seen in appearance.
So open and vibrant

920
01:06:21,076 --> 01:06:22,805
You should know, Delmar

921
01:06:22,911 --> 01:06:25,277
Especially after you have tried your life.

922
01:06:29,317 --> 01:06:30,807
I know

923
01:06:41,329 --> 01:06:48,667
Six letters, meaning discomfort

924
01:06:49,504 --> 01:06:50,801
Disease

925
01:06:52,374 --> 01:06:54,171
-Delma - Catherine.

926
01:06:54,275 --> 01:06:55,708
- How are you doing?
- very good

927
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:57,607
I'm very happy to see you playing crossword puzzles.

928
01:06:57,679 --> 01:06:59,146
- Yes, how are you?
- very good

929
01:06:59,247 --> 01:07:01,112
- I'm well thanks.
- That's great.

930
01:07:01,216 --> 01:07:02,205
What did you buy?

931
01:07:02,317 --> 01:07:03,341
Drawing

932
01:07:03,451 --> 01:07:06,943
I have conceived new creations in my mind.

933
01:07:07,055 --> 01:07:08,682
I can not wait to start painting.

934
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:11,588
I still have many pictures to complete.

935
01:07:11,693 --> 01:07:13,752
Speculate according to the contract we just signed

936
01:07:13,862 --> 01:07:15,796
I should die in my sleep tonight.

937
01:07:16,931 --> 01:07:18,592
"I have no problem."
Great.

938
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,294
"How are you writing?"
- proceeding smoothly

939
01:07:21,403 --> 01:07:22,836
It is? Great

940
01:07:25,373 --> 01:07:26,499
Well, you recently...

941
01:07:26,608 --> 01:07:29,076
Hey Patricia, how are
you doing recently?

942
01:07:42,457 --> 01:07:44,391
Honey, you should not smoke.

943
01:07:44,492 --> 01:07:47,655
She is smoking in the bedroom.

944
01:07:47,762 --> 01:07:49,024
Patricia

945
01:07:49,964 --> 01:07:51,693
Patricia, what are you doing?

946
01:08:09,717 --> 01:08:10,706
James

947
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:23,422
Come on

948
01:09:43,077 --> 01:09:47,377
I saw you

949
01:09:47,949 --> 01:09:50,975
I saw you, call

950
01:09:51,085 --> 01:09:53,212
- Meng Ma - Mammoth

951
01:09:53,321 --> 01:09:54,788
Snow covered pavement

952
01:09:55,857 --> 01:09:57,188
Bum animal

953
01:09:57,292 --> 01:09:58,418
Tree

954
01:09:59,627 --> 01:10:01,094
Heavy ice

955
01:10:13,174 --> 01:10:15,039
- unsupervised - Meng Ma

956
01:10:15,143 --> 01:10:19,375
- One Person - Whales
in Motion, Snow

957
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,539
- Telephone and...
snow

958
01:10:21,649 --> 01:10:23,844
sea breeze

959
01:10:23,952 --> 01:10:25,214
Snow

960
01:10:29,123 --> 01:10:32,092
Wow, who is this?

961
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:38,961
God, is she blind?

962
01:10:46,374 --> 01:10:49,707
Your fingers move line by line

963
01:10:50,645 --> 01:10:54,445
It can be so fast, it reads line by line.

964
01:10:56,184 --> 01:10:57,776
I want to take a picture.

965
01:11:15,837 --> 01:11:18,670
- No.
- It does not matter, it does not matter.

966
01:11:18,773 --> 01:11:20,263
I know you are there.

967
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:22,969
"Sorry to bother you.
"Is there something?"

968
01:11:23,077 --> 01:11:26,843
I just want to take a photo.

969
01:11:26,948 --> 01:11:29,280
What are you filming?

970
01:11:29,384 --> 01:11:31,750
Your hand

971
01:11:32,453 --> 01:11:36,355
Your hand slides across the page

972
01:11:37,392 --> 01:11:40,293
I've never seen a bit of reading before.

973
01:11:40,395 --> 01:11:41,521
It is?

974
01:11:42,463 --> 01:11:44,328
Yes, how did you do it?

975
01:11:44,432 --> 01:11:45,922
Oh, it's not that difficult.

976
01:11:46,034 --> 01:11:50,733
This is just one of many things blind people need to learn.

977
01:11:50,838 --> 01:11:52,703
How to read by hand?

978
01:11:52,807 --> 01:11:55,970
This book is all points

979
01:11:56,077 --> 01:11:59,012
Come and feel

980
01:12:04,419 --> 01:12:06,250
Can I sit by your side?

981
01:12:06,354 --> 01:12:08,413
Of course, sit down.

982
01:12:23,171 --> 01:12:25,571
Sitting alone in the cold wind seems very lonely

983
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:29,904
"No, I do not feel alone.
- do not feel lonely

984
01:12:30,011 --> 01:12:31,501
I like the sound of seawater.

985
01:12:31,612 --> 01:12:33,773
I like the sound of waves.

986
01:12:35,883 --> 01:12:40,081
Stray animals and waves

987
01:12:40,188 --> 01:12:41,883
Thanks for talking to me.

988
01:12:43,224 --> 01:12:44,521
You are welcome

989
01:12:49,097 --> 01:12:50,792
- I am leaving now.
- OK

990
01:12:50,898 --> 01:12:52,627
(I.e.
- Goodbye.

991
01:13:01,275 --> 01:13:06,975
I want to finish my romance with Braille.

992
01:13:07,582 --> 01:13:09,812
- what?
- Yes it's right.

993
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:14,377
I want to learn how to read and write words.

994
01:13:15,623 --> 01:13:16,988
Why are you doing this?

995
01:13:17,959 --> 01:13:20,189
- what?
- Why are you doing this?

996
01:13:23,364 --> 01:13:25,127
Let me see things from different angles

997
01:13:25,233 --> 01:13:26,564
Useful for my writing

998
01:13:27,268 --> 01:13:29,532
Help me think more...

999
01:13:29,637 --> 01:13:30,865
- What else?
- abstract

1000
01:13:30,972 --> 01:13:37,309
You Do not Need Abstract Thinking, James

1001
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:38,640
You do not really need

1002
01:13:38,746 --> 01:13:41,738
No, how do you know how to learn words?

1003
01:13:41,849 --> 01:13:43,111
I think it's hard to go to heaven.

1004
01:13:43,217 --> 01:13:45,617
Almost impossible task

1005
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,654
- Listen - I mean, definitely...

1006
01:13:47,755 --> 01:13:48,483
listen

1007
01:13:48,589 --> 01:13:50,580
- Do you know what that means?
- what?

1008
01:13:50,691 --> 01:13:52,420
Do you know what it means to learn Braille?

1009
01:13:52,527 --> 01:13:54,222
This means that you are not sure what you want to do

1010
01:13:54,328 --> 01:13:55,158
It is

1011
01:13:55,263 --> 01:13:58,562
It means on the road to write books

1012
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:00,600
You're divided again, James

1013
01:14:00,701 --> 01:14:02,999
"This is not a distraction.
- That is

1014
01:14:03,104 --> 01:14:06,835
That means listening, I'll say

1015
01:14:08,643 --> 01:14:10,543
That means you have to learn some words, Catherine.

1016
01:14:10,645 --> 01:14:11,543
What?

1017
01:14:11,646 --> 01:14:12,943
Wake up

1018
01:14:13,047 --> 01:14:14,207
- What are you talking about?
Great.

1019
01:14:14,315 --> 01:14:18,081
Did you forget so soon? This nomination

1020
01:14:18,186 --> 01:14:19,949
If I'm dead...

1021
01:14:20,054 --> 01:14:21,180
God.
- You must complete my creation

1022
01:14:21,289 --> 01:14:22,779
If you die, I'll finish your work.

1023
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:26,018
I do not want to learn words, I do not want to learn.

1024
01:14:26,127 --> 01:14:28,061
- Listen, I'm listening.

1025
01:14:28,162 --> 01:14:33,429
You promised, we agreed
To complete my work

1026
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:38,063
The efforts of my life

1027
01:14:42,176 --> 01:14:43,666
I wish you good luck.

1028
01:14:44,278 --> 01:14:47,270
I really do not understand.

1029
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:51,317
Why do people with normal vision force themselves?

1030
01:14:52,854 --> 01:14:55,152
Go learn what words

1031
01:14:55,823 --> 01:14:58,621
I do not know where to find someone who knows the word.

1032
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,952
In fact, I do not know a blind person.

1033
01:15:01,062 --> 01:15:02,689
I know - The best is

1034
01:15:02,797 --> 01:15:04,890
The woman I met on the beach

1035
01:15:04,999 --> 01:15:06,694
She is jealous, she can not see anything.

1036
01:15:06,801 --> 01:15:08,234
- So what?
- Then I do not know...

1037
01:15:08,336 --> 01:15:10,167
What are you doing?
But that's what I'm doing.

1038
01:15:11,672 --> 01:15:12,764
OK

1039
01:15:45,907 --> 01:15:48,842
There's not even a mark, right?

1040
01:15:50,044 --> 01:15:52,604
Dotted paper only

1041
01:15:59,387 --> 01:16:01,252
Dial the sound from the microphone

1042
01:16:01,355 --> 01:16:03,380
It's James's favorite

1043
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:08,522
However, he encountered difficulties tonight.

1044
01:16:10,598 --> 01:16:12,498
Something complicated

1045
01:16:14,936 --> 01:16:18,133
Pick up the microphone and dial the

1046
01:16:19,073 --> 01:16:21,234
Not an easy task

1047
01:16:24,378 --> 01:16:27,279
At point A, you are someone At
point B, you are someone else.

1048
01:16:27,381 --> 01:16:29,144
At point C, you become...

1049
01:16:50,571 --> 01:16:51,833
I'll be back soon

1050
01:19:01,769 --> 01:19:04,738
Is it necessary to be so excited? James

1051
01:19:04,839 --> 01:19:08,275
We are all here, you are very excited

1052
01:19:08,375 --> 01:19:10,309
"I'm not excited.
- excited to go crazy

1053
01:19:10,411 --> 01:19:11,844
I just tried to get the job done.

1054
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:13,969
Wait

1055
01:19:15,349 --> 01:19:18,341
James is above he is screaming

1056
01:19:18,452 --> 01:19:20,352
Who is James?
"James is my brother.

1057
01:19:20,454 --> 01:19:21,580
I can hear you.

1058
01:19:22,389 --> 01:19:24,220
I can hear you talking, Patricia.

1059
01:19:24,325 --> 01:19:25,758
Is anyone else up?

1060
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:28,090
Does he have a gun? Does he have any alcohol?

1061
01:19:28,195 --> 01:19:29,890
He drank lots of water.

1062
01:19:30,898 --> 01:19:32,832
I can hear other sounds.

1063
01:19:34,368 --> 01:19:36,461
I'm not crazy, I'm not sick.

1064
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:39,539
Do not bother me, I want to do anything.

1065
01:19:40,808 --> 01:19:42,537
I want to read anything.

1066
01:19:44,178 --> 01:19:47,739
I can do this, I'm doing what I want to do.

1067
01:19:48,749 --> 01:19:50,546
I can stay here.

1068
01:19:51,352 --> 01:19:53,377
This table does not have to be here.

1069
01:19:55,589 --> 01:19:57,716
Waiting is a good idea.

1070
01:19:57,825 --> 01:20:00,259
If you can take a while

1071
01:20:00,361 --> 01:20:02,625
Inciting people usually become better controlled

1072
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:06,131
Patricia, who's this voice?

1073
01:20:06,233 --> 01:20:09,498
Is it Catherine? Where did she go?

1074
01:20:09,603 --> 01:20:11,867
The reason James is crazy is unknown.

1075
01:20:11,972 --> 01:20:14,873
But he is absolutely full of anxiety.

1076
01:20:14,975 --> 01:20:16,840
James, let me in...

1077
01:20:16,944 --> 01:20:18,502
"Talk to you, James.
- no

1078
01:20:19,079 --> 01:20:20,011
Said on the other side of the door

1079
01:20:20,114 --> 01:20:21,672
I hear you have some problems.

1080
01:20:21,782 --> 01:20:22,874
I'm coming to help you.

1081
01:20:22,983 --> 01:20:24,450
I do not need your help.

1082
01:20:24,552 --> 01:20:27,146
I'm just writing a book here.

1083
01:20:27,254 --> 01:20:29,154
James, I'm coming to help you.

1084
01:20:29,256 --> 01:20:30,917
Does not bother me

1085
01:20:31,025 --> 01:20:32,993
- Anybody there?
- Frankenstein

1086
01:20:33,093 --> 01:20:34,526
James?

1087
01:20:34,628 --> 01:20:35,822
Catherine

1088
01:20:36,530 --> 01:20:38,691
- Patricia - Is that right?

1089
01:20:38,799 --> 01:20:40,528
- He 's Delmar.
- Patricia, what happened?

1090
01:20:40,634 --> 01:20:41,601
How could this be?

1091
01:20:41,702 --> 01:20:44,694
Lord, please be quiet.
We want James...

1092
01:20:44,805 --> 01:20:46,796
"Calm down for a while."
James is inside?

1093
01:20:46,907 --> 01:20:48,602
Hey, God.

1094
01:20:48,709 --> 01:20:50,574
I can hear you outside the door.

1095
01:20:51,111 --> 01:20:53,238
James? We have three people

1096
01:20:53,347 --> 01:20:54,974
I'm James, too.
There are five people outside.

1097
01:20:55,082 --> 01:20:56,549
- Sir, please.
- Sir, please be quiet.

1098
01:21:00,387 --> 01:21:02,480
There are three people outside, James

1099
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:04,888
We want to help, let's go in and help you

1100
01:21:07,695 --> 01:21:09,390
Okay, we have to act.

1101
01:21:09,496 --> 01:21:11,430
The police are ready to enter the room

1102
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:13,864
Procrastination is still part of the plan.

1103
01:21:15,069 --> 01:21:17,333
Maybe they can win James' trust.

1104
01:21:17,438 --> 01:21:19,429
Avoid causing physical conflicts

1105
01:21:21,976 --> 01:21:23,876
I do not think I need to use sticks.

1106
01:21:23,978 --> 01:21:24,945
(I.e.
Mr.

1107
01:21:29,416 --> 01:21:31,782
James, let's go in and talk to you.

1108
01:21:34,722 --> 01:21:35,654
James

1109
01:21:35,756 --> 01:21:37,451
- Throw it away - What
are you doing behind it?

1110
01:21:37,558 --> 01:21:38,820
Hear Me Now

1111
01:21:38,926 --> 01:21:41,486
We're coming...
Leave and talk to us

1112
01:21:41,595 --> 01:21:43,153
- Take the light.
- We're here to help you.

1113
01:21:43,264 --> 01:21:45,289
- Move quickly, hurry up.
- We're here to help you.

1114
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:47,196
- will not hurt you - turn
off, turn off the light

1115
01:21:47,301 --> 01:21:48,461
James, listen to me, we...

1116
01:21:48,569 --> 01:21:50,833
I did not promise you to come in, this is my place.

1117
01:21:50,938 --> 01:21:51,802
- Get out - do not

1118
01:21:51,906 --> 01:21:53,965
Get out and talk

1119
01:21:54,842 --> 01:21:57,504
No reason to be so angry, James.

1120
01:21:57,645 --> 01:22:01,581
How do you get to the point where you are now?

1121
01:22:02,116 --> 01:22:03,048
Okay, James.

1122
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:04,742
What are you going to do with that microphone?

1123
01:22:04,852 --> 01:22:06,717
I want you to put the microphone down, okay?

1124
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:08,117
You bastard, I want to ruin them.

1125
01:22:08,222 --> 01:22:09,416
We're here to protect you.

1126
01:22:09,523 --> 01:22:10,717
They want to ruin me.

1127
01:22:10,824 --> 01:22:12,621
I have to ruin them, and I have to start first.

1128
01:22:12,726 --> 01:22:13,852
Go get the cushion and go

1129
01:22:13,961 --> 01:22:16,589
You have to try to calm down.

1130
01:22:16,697 --> 01:22:18,096
Patricia and Delmar

1131
01:22:18,198 --> 01:22:20,826
I'm worried about you.
- James, hang up the phone.

1132
01:22:20,935 --> 01:22:22,300
James, let it go, let it go

1133
01:22:22,403 --> 01:22:24,496
Lower the phone

1134
01:22:24,605 --> 01:22:26,334
We can be friends, I'll protect you.

1135
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:29,000
I want this phone.
"I want to be your friend, James.

1136
01:22:29,109 --> 01:22:30,303
I wanna be yours...

1137
01:22:37,818 --> 01:22:39,809
James, relax.
James

1138
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,148
"Relax, James.
- Do not touch me.

1139
01:22:41,255 --> 01:22:42,244
- It's all right.
James

1140
01:22:42,356 --> 01:22:44,586
Do not touch me, you still play

1141
01:22:44,692 --> 01:22:46,091
James, relax

1142
01:22:46,193 --> 01:22:48,320
James is full of anxiety

1143
01:22:48,929 --> 01:22:50,726
- He's confused.
Relax

1144
01:22:50,831 --> 01:22:53,925
- I am here.
"Ladies, you can not come in."

1145
01:22:54,034 --> 01:22:55,968
I'm here, James.
- turned around

1146
01:22:57,004 --> 01:22:59,837
Even so, he feels pain like we do.

1147
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:01,635
- Do not touch me.
Relax

1148
01:23:01,742 --> 01:23:04,870
James's resistance is caused by muscle spasms

1149
01:23:05,379 --> 01:23:07,643
Frightened and scared as he

1150
01:23:07,748 --> 01:23:10,979
The more pain he has, the more he fights.

1151
01:23:12,252 --> 01:23:14,584
Today, the hand and voice of the police

1152
01:23:14,688 --> 01:23:17,384
And his calm rhythm
Helping James

1153
01:23:17,491 --> 01:23:20,187
Make the most of the damage

1154
01:23:20,294 --> 01:23:21,556
I can hear you.

1155
01:23:22,196 --> 01:23:23,458
I can hear you.

1156
01:23:27,868 --> 01:23:31,565
Do not worry, James, it will be better.

1157
01:23:35,976 --> 01:23:36,908
James?

1158
01:23:37,011 --> 01:23:38,342
They got out

1159
01:23:38,445 --> 01:23:40,606
Hey, James, I'm here.

1160
01:23:41,048 --> 01:23:43,016
- James - You

1161
01:23:43,117 --> 01:23:44,880
You angry gay

1162
01:23:44,985 --> 01:23:45,849
- Let's go.
James

1163
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:48,444
- I'll go with you.
gay

1164
01:23:48,555 --> 01:23:49,283
James

1165
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:54,327
Gay gay

1166
01:23:54,428 --> 01:23:55,895
James, I'm with you.

1167
01:23:55,996 --> 01:23:57,623
Calm down, my God.

1168
01:23:57,731 --> 01:23:59,460
Oh, my God, James?

1169
01:26:36,056 --> 01:26:38,650
Sometimes people choose to accept

1170
01:26:40,494 --> 01:26:43,691
Sometimes people choose to leave

1171
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:41,945
Everything needs to be created You
need to trust someone's hands

1172
01:27:57,571 --> 01:28:03,100
At the time I was sitting on the
wall I'm sitting on the floor

1173
01:28:04,344 --> 01:28:07,108
I sat on the floor and listened

1174
01:28:08,982 --> 01:28:12,543
All I can do is listen.

1175
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:15,047
I do not feel so slow

1176
01:28:17,391 --> 01:28:20,622
I've never been, this is humiliated

1177
01:28:20,727 --> 01:28:23,252
I've never been humiliated in this life.

1178
01:28:23,764 --> 01:28:25,288
My life

1179
01:28:27,234 --> 01:28:33,537
I have trouble calming down to work.
Things are not organized in order.

1180
01:28:34,341 --> 01:28:38,744
You have to sit down and tidy them up nicely.

1181
01:28:43,016 --> 01:28:44,847
I just want to think a lot

1182
01:28:45,352 --> 01:28:48,480
Write down the whole brain idea

1183
01:28:50,524 --> 01:28:54,358
Drawing, painting, writing

1184
01:28:55,162 --> 01:28:58,461
Thoughtful, full of ideas

1185
01:29:06,673 --> 01:29:09,665
- Patricia.
- Catherine.

1186
01:29:18,051 --> 01:29:22,181
One day, many days, there were no white whales at the time.

1187
01:29:22,289 --> 01:29:27,226
So hit, there is

1188
01:29:28,128 --> 01:29:30,494
And there will always be

1189
01:29:33,166 --> 01:29:38,433
This requires an artist
Everything needs to be created

1190
01:29:39,339 --> 01:29:41,603
You need to trust someone's hands.

1191
01:29:45,312 --> 01:29:48,247
It's like a heavy burden, right?

1192
01:29:48,348 --> 01:29:50,612
Yes

1193
01:29:52,252 --> 01:29:54,777
I tried not to think so, James.

1194
01:29:56,123 --> 01:30:01,561
This can not be thought of, it is very fragile

1195
01:30:01,661 --> 01:30:06,689
Yes, it is so fragile.

1196
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:18,373
So I need to make a contract

1197
01:30:20,814 --> 01:30:22,145
An agreement

1198
01:30:30,624 --> 01:30:32,251
Let's go home.

1199
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:35,719
- Let's go.
- OK

1200
01:30:37,998 --> 01:30:42,367
Listen, we like each other, right?

1201
01:30:43,069 --> 01:30:44,263
Right

1202
01:30:44,371 --> 01:30:46,305
We met a long time ago.

1203
01:30:46,406 --> 01:30:47,270
Yes

1204
01:30:47,374 --> 01:30:49,365
- We understand each other's creations.
Yes, James.

1205
01:30:49,476 --> 01:30:51,501
And we trust each other.

1206
01:30:52,345 --> 01:30:53,505
Yes

1207
01:33:09,382 --> 01:33:13,512
The most difficult balance is with yourself

1208
01:33:15,555 --> 01:33:16,920
Right?

1209
01:33:20,493 --> 01:33:22,961
I can only see his head.

1210
01:33:25,198 --> 01:33:27,428
I know his face has white makeup.

1211
01:33:28,902 --> 01:33:30,233
But I can not see

1212
01:33:31,705 --> 01:33:34,538
Because I can only see his head.

1213
01:33:51,224 --> 01:33:54,625
Hey, what do you want to do?

1214
01:33:57,497 --> 01:33:59,362
He's just an avatar, do not listen to him.

1215
01:34:01,635 --> 01:34:03,193
He's just an avatar

1216
01:34:22,389 --> 01:34:28,794
There is no such thing as discomfort at all.
Some are just that

1217
01:34:29,963 --> 01:34:31,328
Then this

1218
01:34:33,833 --> 01:34:35,164
These are

1219
01:34:39,239 --> 01:34:40,672
It is

1220
01:34:47,247 --> 01:34:49,477
Just positive thinking

1221
01:34:50,717 --> 01:34:58,317
Now we only have "up" in our conversation.

1222
01:35:18,378 --> 01:35:23,975
I slowly go back

1223
01:35:26,653 --> 01:35:30,145
Slowly, very slowly

1224
01:35:32,459 --> 01:35:39,388
Until my back touches the wall

1225
01:35:49,442 --> 01:35:53,435
About ten minutes, right, ten minutes

1226
01:35:55,281 --> 01:35:56,771
No, it's ten minutes.

1227
01:36:00,186 --> 01:36:02,984
Like the button you pressed the walkie-talkie

1228
01:36:03,757 --> 01:36:06,191
Waiting to hear who's there

1229
01:36:06,926 --> 01:36:08,052
It is

1230
01:36:12,732 --> 01:36:14,199
I chose a pie chart.

1231
01:36:16,369 --> 01:36:17,631
Turn on the radio

1232
01:36:26,045 --> 01:36:27,535
This is the tail of a whale.

1233
01:36:32,752 --> 01:36:34,447
I do not know how real it is.

1234
01:36:41,861 --> 01:36:45,991
Sometimes I wake up and I like to talk to myself.

1235
01:37:05,885 --> 01:37:08,353
I like the sound coming from the microphone.
