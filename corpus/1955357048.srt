00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,567
About that game tonight.

4
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:53,167
Not now, Richard.

5
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,767
- Hi, Sam.
- How's it going?

6
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:09,067
- We can't talk to each other.
- Why?

7
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:13,867
Set the frequencies. We can
only talk to the game master.

8
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:18,433
Oh. Well, you've really gone
all out here, Bradley.

9
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,067
Too bad you're gonna
lose tonight.

10
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:25,667
- Never happened before.
- Well, we've never played in
a real building before.

11
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:27,300
Take a look at this.

12
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:30,767
I designed the program
to come up with the code words
and clues.

13
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:35,633
And assign which classrooms
we're covering, the locations
of the weapons, the keys,

And, watch this.

You were right.

18
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:49,800
The electronics lab had the
tracking equipment we were
looking for.

19
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:51,967
Transmitter. Tracker.

20
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:56,767
Ah...

21
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:00,433
- SAM: Who's wearing that?
- BRADLEY: Tracy.

22
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,600
I slipped her one in
her pocket. (CHUCKLES)

23
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:08,667
I can put trackers on every
floor. So, now, if all the
quest knights have these,

24
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:13,667
then, the game master can
monitor our progress through
the tower.

25
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:17,633
This is going to be our
best game

26

that was an impressive bit
of work.

Did you want something,
Richard?

30
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:35,967
Well, I was just wondering
about the game tonight, sir.

31
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:40,267
Well, it sounds like a
marvelous opportunity to
hone one's mental skills.

32
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,367
That, it is.

33
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:46,067

about playing. It is his game.

But, I'll be working long
hours at the hospital, and...

You'll have to stay home
and cook my meals, and,

like, mend my socks and give
me little Sams.

40

I'll be just as busy as you,

42
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,567
Running my engineering

- Look, I don't know, okay?

00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:32,567
Well, you gotta answer, man.
Just answer.

48
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:35,600
- Okay. Three.
- Wrong!

49
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,700
There were only two, Rich,
you know.

50

I don't give a shit how many
little kids played the drummer
on The Partridge Family, okay?

51

That's because you have
no sense of culture. What you
guys do with Sorenson?

52
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,567
Oh, he's telling the class his
lip color joke.

53
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:49,667

- That's Shakma.

Shakma?

57
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,933
- What did you guys do to him?
- We've injected corticotropin
in his brain.

58
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:06,167
- TRACY: Gross.
- No, it's actually quite
fascinating.

59
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,300
We've been working on a
stable version
of corticotropin.

60
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:12,100
- Stable?
- Well, it usually inhibits
aggression.

61
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:15,233
But, sometimes it has
the opposite effect.

62
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,333
TRACY: So why use this
poor monkey?

63
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,767

most aggressive primate.

of phenothiazine.

another 200.

of class.

00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:16,900
Yeah, I'd love to. If you're
not mad at me.

at you?

have to be careful,

the building the way it says

172
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:23,467
and then follow Sorenson's
orders during the game.

173
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:26,500
Game? That's what you're
doing tonight?

174
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,367
Yeah, Richard's Nemesis.

175
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:29,733
Nemesis.

176
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,400
Yeah, he's an unbeatable
enemy.

177
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:33,733
Or the Greek goddess
of vengeance.

178
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,500
Oh, great. I'm dating the
goddess of vengeance.

179
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:39,400
Hey, it's only gonna take
a couple hours, okay?

180
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:42,800
Well, uh...
Not necessarily.

181
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:46,067
Last time we played the game,
it went well into the wee
hours of the morning,

182
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:49,567
and that was just sitting
around a table.

183
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:52,500
Terrific. Well, you children
have fun.

184
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:55,167
Hey, Laura...
Hey, why me?

185
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:57,900
You make the perfect goddess.

186
00:14:57,967 --> 00:15:00,700
Hey, be at the faculty lounge
at 7:30.

187
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,800
- All right.

195
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:06,133
Professor, I've checked
the building and it's empty.
Over.

196
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,833
All right. I have set the
patterns on floors two,
three, and four,

197
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,867
and all I'm waiting for now is
for Richard to actually go in
and turn the lights on or off.

198
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:26,067
And to set the clues in all
of the rooms. Over.

199
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,367
I'm sure he's on his way.
Over.

200
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:34,733
Oh yeah, I'm sure.
Over and out.

we gotta learn to think on our
toes, right?

204
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:52,633
See, I got this for Richard.
We make him wear this all
night, right?

205
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,167
And that'll teach him
to butt in.

206
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:03,767
Anyway, what I was about to
say before I browned my
shorts, thank you very much,

207
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:07,500
perhaps we should lay
a little money down on this
game tonight.

208
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:08,967
Say...

209
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,633
A c-note?

210
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,433
- Make it five c-notes and
you've got yourself a deal.
- What?

211
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,967
- That's too much.
- TRACY: Why, don't you
think you're gonna win?

212
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:23,667
- Oh, you need a loan.
- Do you have $500
laying around?

00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,133
Okay, okay.

- All right, I'm in.
- Oh!

215
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:30,067
Then that's settled.

- $500?

Where is everybody?

219
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:53,867
Ah, they're all inside.
So they won't see which rooms
are lit.

220
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:58,167
So, what am I supposed to do
while you're in playing with
your little friends?

221
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:01,667
Hey, this is not gonna take
long. Check back in
three hours.

222
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,500
- Yeah, right.

in better shape than I am
anyway, huh?

225
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,367
I said 7:30.

a big boy.

wear it.

from the bad guy.

232

This just gets better
and better.

233
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,700
Professor, I found Richard and
he's on his way down.
Over and out.

234
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:18,800
Richard, did you forget to do
the fifth floor?

235
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:22,233
It's all labs. I thought we'd
leave most of it lit.

236
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,833
Oh, no, that makes it too
easy. Now go back and
follow the charts.

237
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,333
The computer lab is a cavern.
See, it should be dark.

238
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,800
- The bio lab...
- Well, I was thinking.

239
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:35,733
There's $100,000 of
equipment back there.

240
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,067
Shouldn't they be secured?

241
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:41,500
I'm locking the building
outside, I think we can trust
our own group.

242
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:44,900
- Well, I know,
but I was just...
- Richard.

243
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,133
Go make the changes.

244
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,467
Yes sir. Whatever you say.

245
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:04,767
Okay. Building's locked up
tight. Nobody gets out till
we have a rescued princess,

246
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,067
and a defeated demon.

247
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:10,700
- I'll pass these out.
- Oh Brad, I've given each
one of the homing devices

248
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:13,300
an identity of its own,
so just for fun,

249
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:16,067
let's try and figure out which
character you are, huh?

250
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:18,233
- Oh great!
- Huh!

251
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,533
All right, well, go down to
the second floor as soon as
you're ready.

252
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,833
Oh, your starting locations
are on the scrolls inside.

253
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,367
Yeah, I'll start contacting
you in a few minutes.

254
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:29,133

I hope so.

257
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,300

the code phrase?

258
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:58,167
Yeah.

259
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,933
Now remember, don't come
out until you hear it recited
in order.
