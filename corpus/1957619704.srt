1
00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:15,504
(upbeat comical music)

2
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:32,352
- Justin, vaminos amigo.

3
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,393
- [Justin] Coming!

4
00:02:34,393 --> 00:02:35,226
- [TV Announcer] Stay tuned.

5
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:36,880
We'll be right back after these messages.

6
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,010
- Hey kids.

7
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,630
I'm Stu Stuart, president of Toytropolis,

8
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,270
maker of many fine toy products

9
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,620
including the hottest
item this holiday season,

10
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,330
our facilitator, the definitive lifeline

11
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,893
for any young adventurer.

12
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:54,580
- I got mine.

13
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,550
- I just wanna wish each and every one

14
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,302
of you the happiest of holidays

15
00:02:59,302 --> 00:03:01,390
and remember, when you're thinking toys,

16
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,470
think Toytropolis.

17
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,323
After all, you can never have enough toys.

18
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,730
- Katie, could you see if the
garage door was deadbolted?

19
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,910
- No.

20
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,910
- You go check?

21
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,840
- No.

22
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,000
- [Mom] Where's your suitcase?

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,173
- I'm wearing this.

24
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,010
- You know, I don't mean
to criticize your new trend

25
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,990
but don't you think you should

26
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,730
bring at least one change of clothes?

27
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,000
- If I do, can Collin come with us?

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
- Katie, we've been through this.

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,523
- Don't I know it.

30
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:30,550
- You know, we like Collin a lot.

31
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,160
He's a very unique young man.

32
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,730
- Yeah, sweetheart, Collin

33
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,880
should spend Thanksgiving with his family.

34
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,270
- His family's dysfunctional.

35
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,740
He's trapped inside a living hell.

36
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,120
We need to help him.

37
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,270
- He doesn't need help,
he needs treatment.

38
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,853
- Way to go, Dan.

39
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,993
- This is gonna be good.

40
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,740
- Sorry to rush you, buddy,
but we're on a schedule.

41
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,100
- Did you remember to set
the burglar alarm, honey?

42
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,110
- Don't worry, I got it covered.

43
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,760
Oh, hold on, I gotta tie my shoe.

44
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,830
- Okay kids, all set?

45
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,663
- You bet.

46
00:04:16,663 --> 00:04:17,740
- Yippee.

47
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,680
- Oh come on, sis.

48
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,440
Where's your family spirit?

49
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,850
You used to be such a happy little girl.

50
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,700
- Shut up, dweeb.

51
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:28,594
(air blowing)

52
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:31,500
- Did you leave food for the lizard?

53
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,660
- [Family] Howard.

54
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,148
- No, you did.

55
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:34,981
- Oh, that's right.

56
00:04:35,856 --> 00:04:36,689
(popping)

57
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:38,040
(screaming)

58
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,873
What was that?

59
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,623
- What's so funny?

60
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,610
- [Mom] What is it?

61
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:48,540
- Gotcha!

62
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,710
You guys should have seen your faces.

63
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,140
- Why do you do these things, Justin?

64
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,350
- 'Cause they're funny.

65
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,740
- Young man, you're on probation.

66
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,323
(upbeat music)

67
00:05:07,612 --> 00:05:09,862
(grunting)

68
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,563
- Stop that, it's bugging me.

69
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:17,060
(grunting)

70
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,690
You're such a dork.

71
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,523
- Slacker.

72
00:05:19,523 --> 00:05:20,356
- Get a life.

73
00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:21,333
- Take a shower.

74
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:25,754
(grunting)

75
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:28,775
- I said stop it!

76
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:30,510
- [Dad] Hey, hey, knock it off.

77
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,650
You want me to pull this car over?

78
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,020
- Justin, stop bothering your sister!

79
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,240
- She started it.

80
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,177
- He's being a jerk!

81
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:37,010
- Yeah right.

82
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,843
- Just put a lid on it.

83
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:38,813
- You put a lid on it!

84
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,870
- Apologize to your mother, Justin.

85
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,731
- No, I didn't do anything.

86
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:45,827
- You wanna be grounded?

87
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:47,540
- I'm not sorry.

88
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,960
I'm not sorry for anything I've ever done.

89
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,120
You guys cannot take a joke

90
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,263
and she's weird and smells funny.

91
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,393
I wish I wasn't here.

92
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:59,521
I wish I was spending
Thanksgiving by myself.

93
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,610
- You really feel that way, Justin?

94
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:04,484
- Yeah.

95
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,009
(downbeat music)

96
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,520
- I'm ready to fall asleep.

97
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,660
I gotta stop and get a coffee.

98
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,580
- I'm serious, Perry, I think
you're addicted to caffeine

99
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,165
and that scares me.

100
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:27,250
- You know what scares me?

101
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,253
Your face.

102
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,780
- We have to stop at the mountain store.

103
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,440
I forgot to get the cranberry sauce.

104
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,190
- Can't do without cranberry sauce.

105
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,532
- Man.

106
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:44,395
(gentle music)

107
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,533
Justin, are you coming?

108
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,771
- [Male] Perry.

109
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:10,830
You know, I wanna get some liquid.

110
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,080
- Yeah, yeah, fine,
there's a store up ahead.

111
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,140
(downbeat music)

112
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,045
Now let's make this snappy.

113
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:33,795
We ain't got all day.

114
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:59,974
Hey, hey, look at this, copy cats.

115
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,327
What are you doing?

116
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,874
- Hey, did you lock
the patio door at home?

117
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:09,373
- The answer is still yes.

118
00:08:31,837 --> 00:08:33,980
- You know, Perry, I've
always been the bad person.

119
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,510
I mean I got thrown out of
nine different grade schools.

120
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,042
I never even made it past seventh grade.

121
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:40,067
- What are you talking about?

122
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:40,900
I saw your eighth grade diploma

123
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,733
hanging on your wall.

124
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:42,566
- Yeah, they gave me an eighth grade

125
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:43,399
so I would leave the school.

126
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,390
Can you believe it?

127
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,700
- [Perry] Some guys get all the luck.

128
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,870
High school.

129
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,566
Man, no kid should ever
have to go through that.

130
00:08:48,566 --> 00:08:50,950
I don't care how rotten he is.

131
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,373
- What I really wanted to say is you're

132
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:54,610
like a hundred times badder than I am.

133
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,223
- I try real hard, I do.

134
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,660
- Well we finally made it.

135
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,493
Here we are.

136
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:24,680
Don't be shy about helping us unpack.

137
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,160
- I've gotta call Collin,
I can sense he needs me.

138
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,170
- I get the sense he wants
you to call him collect.

139
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,080
The phone bill is gonna
cost more than this trip.

140
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,460
- Honey, she's in love

141
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,830
and there's nothing we can do about it.

142
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,110
- How could she be in love?

143
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,660
She just met him two weeks ago.

144
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,750
Justin, come on.

145
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,320
Help us unpack.

146
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,153
Hey buddy.

147
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,630
Hey honey, did Justin go inside?

148
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,463
- No.

149
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,300
- He's not here, he's gone.

150
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,200
- How can that be?

151
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,890
- Must have gotten out at the store.

152
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,327
- Oh my god, let's go.

153
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:57,650
- I hope this isn't
another one of his jokes.

154
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,483
Katie!

155
00:09:58,483 --> 00:09:59,556
- What?

156
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:00,440
- [Dad] We're going to
the store to find Justin.

157
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,360
He's missing.

158
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,870
- That's the best news
I've heard all week.

159
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,820
- Just stay here in case he comes back.

160
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,480
- And stay off the phone
in case he tries to call.

161
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,040
- Can I have the key?

162
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,873
- Doormat.

163
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:21,918
- Justin!

164
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,243
Justin!

165
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,733
- Nobody's seen him.

166
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,330
- Well he's gotta be here somewhere.

167
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,280
He can't have just disappeared.

168
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,560
- He's just blowing off some steam.

169
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,900
He's probably back at the cabin right now.

170
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,360
He knows the way.

171
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,353
- What if he's not?

172
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,740
- We'll have to take it from there.

173
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:00,220
- Ah, the great outdoors.

174
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,490
There's nothing like it.

175
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,913
- So what do you say?

176
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,930
Build a campfire, make
some s'mores, sing a song?

177
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,560
Tell a joke, a song and then a joke?

178
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,630
You gotta mix it up, right?

179
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,290
- Ha ha.

180
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,380
- [Male] Ah, the mountain
makes me so giddy.

181
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,313
- [Perry] Yeah, well you
just keep it to yourself.

182
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:21,082
(suspenseful music)

183
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:31,172
- What a dump.

184
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,290
- [Perry] I wanna order a pizza.

185
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,170
- [Male] In this neck of the woods?

186
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,710
Come on, there ain't a pizza
parlor for a hundred miles.

187
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,030
- [Perry] Maybe we're in a delivery area.

188
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,130
Give me the cellphone.

189
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,173
- Telephone.

190
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,560
- You got a clip?

191
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,296
Thanks.

192
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:54,190
(knocking)

193
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,480
Who knows we're here?

194
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,170
- No one that I know of.

195
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,550
Put that thing away and act casual

196
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,050
but be ready to smack someone.

197
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,113
- Thank you.

198
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:13,330
(mumbling)

199
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,330
- Excuse me but where did you come from?

200
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,070
- Austria, I come here with my father.

201
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,993
He make go go budget American movie.

202
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,600
Ah, I see you have a telephone.

203
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,643
I must use it now.

204
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:27,380
I need call my father.

205
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,570
- That is a cellular phone.

206
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,700
It costs money to use that phone.

207
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,030
You got money?

208
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,860
- Give me quarter, I make dollar for you.

209
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,280
- What do you mean make dollar?

210
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,963
- Quarter, give me.

211
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,803
- Whoa, look!

212
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,780
Did you see this?

213
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,170
- Telephone?

214
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,003
- It's over there.

215
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:50,543
Keep it under a minute.

216
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,632
- Hey, give me 20 dollars.

217
00:12:53,632 --> 00:12:54,465
- What, are you crazy?

218
00:12:54,465 --> 00:12:57,340
- Come on, this kid could
make us a lot of money.

219
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,507
(beeping)

220
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,963
- I know you're hurting.

221
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,113
I'm here for you.

222
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,653
- Arnold please.

223
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:17,320
Papa, it is me.

224
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,993
I am with my new friends.

225
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,150
Yes, papa, I will be very nice.

226
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,150
No, papa, I do not want to hurt them.

227
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,173
Okay papa, see you soon.

228
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:32,985
- [Perry] That was your pops?

229
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:33,818
- Mm-hmm.

230
00:13:33,818 --> 00:13:36,520
- Dude, you mean to tell me your dad is--

231
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,990
- Mm-hmm.

232
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,190
- Look kid, we'd love to have your company

233
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,130
but we've got things we gotta do

234
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,440
so why don't you run along?

235
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,040
- You mean you won't let me stay?

236
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,023
- No, now beat it.

237
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,197
- Can you make a hundred out of this?

238
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:51,390
- [Perry] What are you doing?

239
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,333
- It is possible.

240
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,122
Guess not.

241
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:04,870
(groaning)

242
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,060
- Can't beat up a kid.

243
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,980
Look kid, it was nice meeting you

244
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,450
but be a good kid and don't
let our whereabouts be known,

245
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,120
okay, we're here for rest and relaxation

246
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,480
and do not wish to be bothered

247
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,530
so why don't you go play with your bears.

248
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,149
Are you nuts?

249
00:14:21,816 --> 00:14:24,399
(gentle music)

250
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,500
- Where's that phone book?

251
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,810
I can't find it anywhere.

252
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,130
- You could be a brain
surgeon and try 911.

253
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,943
- Lose the sarcasm, Katie.

254
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,550
- I'm not one to say I told you so

255
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,933
but hey, I told you so.

256
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,732
- Oh my god, what's
this doing in the oven?

257
00:14:44,732 --> 00:14:45,610
- Do you think Justin will get mauled

258
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,703
to death by a bear?

259
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,843
- It's ringing.

260
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,170
- [Officer] Sheriff's department.

261
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,180
What can I do for you?

262
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,130
- I wanna report a missing person, my son.

263
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,210
This is Danny Rogers.

264
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,750
I've got a cabin up on Quail Pass.

265
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,230
- [Officer] Fooled you, huh?

266
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,063
(laughing)

267
00:14:59,063 --> 00:14:59,896
We ain't around right now.

268
00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:01,870
Went to the big city for turkey day.

269
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,200
We'll be back on Sunday.

270
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,290
We hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving.

271
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,480
Leave a message if you like.

272
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,633
We'll be checking in.

273
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,940
- What, what's wrong?

274
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,140
- Sheriff's out of town.

275
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,710
- How can the sheriff be out of town?

276
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,040
- [Dad] That's what you get
when you vacation in Mayberry.

277
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,873
- Give me that.

278
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,050
State police, please, it's an emergency.

279
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:25,883
- [Female] Hold please.

280
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,180
- [Officer] Station 42, may I help you?

281
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,510
- Yes, I wanna report a missing child.

282
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,380
- [Officer] When did you see him last?

283
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,804
- The last time we saw
him, this afternoon.

284
00:15:32,804 --> 00:15:33,870
- [Officer] Can't do anything about that--

285
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,190
- What do you mean you can't?

286
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,140
- [Officer] He's gotta
be missing for 24 hours.

287
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,640
- That's ridiculous.

288
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,550
- [Officer] Sorry, ma'am,
that's standard procedure.

289
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,862
Now if you wanna leave us with a number--

290
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:41,695
- Damn.

291
00:15:41,695 --> 00:15:42,528
- What?

292
00:15:42,528 --> 00:15:44,100
- He has to be missing 24 hours

293
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,050
before he can be considered missing.

294
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,150
- That's unbelievable.

295
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,410
- Sarge, some woman just called

296
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,600
and said her kid was missing.

297
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,770
- Well did you tell her what
the standard procedure is?

298
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,070
- Sure did, standard procedure.

299
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,680
And then she hung up on me.

300
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,040
- Well ain't nothing we can about that.

301
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,810
Besides, that's a county matter.

302
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,800
- We promised Earl we'd
cover for him this weekend,

303
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,633
remember?

304
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:04,550
I feel terrible, Sarge.

305
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,670
What if the little fella's hurt?

306
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,860
- Earl's 47, he can take care of himself.

307
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,670
- No, I mean the missing kid.

308
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,480
Anything can happen
out there in the woods.

309
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,080
- Would you quit griping?

310
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,230
Why don't you spend the energy

311
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,492
on something more useful like
getting this place cleaned up.

312
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:21,325
(beeping)

313
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:23,270
Oh, Betty will have my butt.

314
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,230
- I've been meaning to, Sarge.

315
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,260
I just didn't get to it today.

316
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,559
I didn't have time--

317
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,392
- You can start tomorrow.

318
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:31,810
I want the floors mopped
and the windows washed

319
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,550
and see if you can't find
them festive Christmas lights

320
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,040
and string 'em up.

321
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,160
This is a holiday season.

322
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,880
We should show some seasonal spirit.

323
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,810
- Right, Sarge.

324
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,643
Good night.

325
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,990
- What's on your shirt there?

326
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,356
Ho, gotcha!

327
00:16:46,356 --> 00:16:48,560
(ripping)

328
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,463
Oh, that boy's dumb as a box of rocks.

329
00:16:57,132 --> 00:17:00,049
(mysterious music)

330
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:12,500
(wolf howling)

331
00:17:17,143 --> 00:17:17,988
- [Perry] Kurt, what are you doing?

332
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:18,850
Will you come on already?

333
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:19,910
We ain't got all night.

334
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,230
- [Kurt] I'm coming, I'm coming.

335
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,080
- [Perry] Enough with the packing.

336
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,660
Come on, let's go, will you please?

337
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,493
Come on!

338
00:17:25,493 --> 00:17:26,326
- [Kurt] Okay.

339
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:32,520
- [Perry] Here, I'm driving.

340
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,167
- [Kurt] No, I want to drive now.

341
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:35,467
- [Perry] No, I'm driving.

342
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,603
You're lucky I'm even talking to you.

343
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,950
- [Justin] Tight security.

344
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,620
- I'm never gonna get any sleep tonight

345
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,730
until we find him, you
know that, don't you?

346
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,850
- You think I will?

347
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,410
- Justin, we're back.

348
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,673
Are you here?

349
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,313
I feel so helpless.

350
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:12,790
- All we can do is keep looking.

351
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,220
We'll get an early start tomorrow.

352
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,690
- We can put up some mug shots.

353
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,290
- That's a good idea, Kate.

354
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,663
We'll drop some pictures
off at the mountain store.

355
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,443
Hey mom, how you doing?

356
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,960
- Do you think we were too hard on him?

357
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,793
- I hope not.

358
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,643
I hope not.

359
00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:40,964
You know Justin, he'll be fine.

360
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:46,151
(gun firing)

361
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:51,108
(trumpet playing)

362
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:02,595
(suspenseful music)

363
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,433
Nothing like a good short sheeting.

364
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:03,984
Uh-oh.

365
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:26,631
(owl hooting)

366
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:37,873
Dad, turn off the TV, I'm trying to ...

367
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,395
- [Perry] Give me a hand with this.

368
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:44,773
- I can't, I have a bad back.

369
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:45,923
- Mayday, mayday.

370
00:20:52,328 --> 00:20:54,178
- You're unbelievable, you know that?

371
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:03,650
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

372
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,483
The door's open.

373
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,975
(mumbling)

374
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,710
Perry, take it easy with
the merchandise, okay?

375
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,190
- Must have been that foreign kid.

376
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,840
- Yeah, he's probably still here.

377
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,273
Goldilocks.

378
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,060
Papa bear is home.

379
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,370
And he's got some porridge for you.

380
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,797
- Porridge?

381
00:21:27,797 --> 00:21:28,630
Wait a minute.

382
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,730
All the TV dinners are accounted for.

383
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,300
Come on, let's take care of business.

384
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,722
(gentle music)

385
00:22:00,342 --> 00:22:02,925
(radio static)

386
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,000
- [Announcer] We interrupt this broadcast

387
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,720
for a special report.

388
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,310
Chelsea Stuart, daughter
of billionaire toy magnate,

389
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,890
Stu Stuart, was kidnapped late last night

390
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,940
from St. Mary's Academy
Boarding School for Girls.

391
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,930
Two suspects were
spotted leaving the scene

392
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,443
in a white minivan.

393
00:22:20,762 --> 00:22:22,688
And now back to our top
three billboard countdown.

394
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:26,257
(suspenseful music)

395
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:29,010
- Now you promise to be quiet
and I'll remove that gag.

396
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,530
You promise?

397
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:33,003
- The man asked you a question, sister?

398
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,180
- Put her in the chair.

399
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,943
- Here goes nothing.

400
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,690
- Now we wanna be hospitable, little girl,

401
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,590
we really do.

402
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,423
- That's right.

403
00:22:49,423 --> 00:22:50,430
- But we're gonna get what we want

404
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,600
and we're not gonna play games.

405
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,433
- [Kurt] That's right.

406
00:22:52,433 --> 00:22:54,250
- Now you cooperate
and you won't get hurt.

407
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,290
You don't, you will.

408
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,123
- That's right.

409
00:22:56,123 --> 00:22:57,100
- Is that all you can say?

410
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,933
- That's right.

411
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,213
- Alright.

412
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,430
I'm gonna remove this, be quiet.

413
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,800
(knocking)

414
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,063
- Are we expecting someone?

415
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:21,270
- Ah geez, I knew it,
it's that annoying kid.

416
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,400
- Well let's pretend we're not here.

417
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,643
- He already saw us.

418
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,960
- I'm so sorry!

419
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,350
- Alright, come on, come on, come on.

420
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,183
Get your hands off him.

421
00:23:33,183 --> 00:23:34,016
What do you want?

422
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:35,083
- I want to say sorry!

423
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,188
I stole your money
yesterday and I feel so bad!

424
00:23:40,188 --> 00:23:41,667
Here, here it is!

425
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:43,053
I don't want it and I don't need it.

426
00:23:43,053 --> 00:23:44,520
- Give it to me, it's mine.

427
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,296
- Wait a minute, Perry, it's my money.

428
00:23:46,296 --> 00:23:47,129
- What do you mean, I gave it to you.

429
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:48,090
- That's why it's mine.

430
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,240
- I didn't say for keeps.

431
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,280
- You fight over it!

432
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,060
I not want it!

433
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,893
- Gimme!

434
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,273
Gimme!

435
00:23:56,273 --> 00:23:57,713
- [Kurt] Nope, it's mine, give me that.

436
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,120
- Gimme!

437
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,620
You're a bully, you know that?

438
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,300
- I not wish to cause problem.

439
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,950
- Yeah, right, good, now beat it.

440
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,110
What, go!

441
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,310
- May I ask large favor, please?

442
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,552
- No!

443
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:15,385
- Pretty please?

444
00:24:15,385 --> 00:24:16,860
- Negative.

445
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,230
- Pretty please with gobs and gobs

446
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,361
of Swedish meatballs and wienerschnitzels?

447
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:23,475
(groaning)

448
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:24,743
I need to use restroom.

449
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,990
- Okay, last room all
the way down the hall

450
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,550
but don't get lost.

451
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,383
- Thank you.

452
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,380
- Hey, you think I can ask
his dad for an autograph?

453
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,793
He's famous.

454
00:24:42,143 --> 00:24:44,776
(gentle music)

455
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:47,443
(phone ringing)

456
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,630
- Happy holidays from station 42.

457
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,080
May I help you?

458
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,592
- Morning, Ethel.

459
00:24:56,592 --> 00:24:58,647
(screaming)

460
00:24:58,647 --> 00:24:59,886
- Is that a fact?

461
00:24:59,886 --> 00:25:00,719
(banging)

462
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:01,560
I'll call you back.

463
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,393
Sarge.

464
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,193
Sarge.

465
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:10,220
(slamming)

466
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,090
- How many times have I told you

467
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,480
to keep the files all closed?

468
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,380
- Sorry, Sarge, it was an accident.

469
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,447
- Hit the head on that.

470
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:18,040
Will you stop cleaning me, boy?

471
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,100
Stop cleaning me!

472
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,401
Here, get back to work.

473
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:22,523
- Sorry, Sarge.

474
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,450
Hey, (mumbling) just
called from channel three.

475
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,010
He said they got a fax of that
missing child this morning.

476
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,240
The mother must have
phoned the papers too.

477
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,510
- Damn, that's all I need.

478
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,840
A bunch of panicky parents trying

479
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,690
to take matters into their own hands.

480
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,680
Alright, make the usual calls

481
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,550
and put it out over the wire.

482
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,036
- Yes sir!

483
00:25:42,036 --> 00:25:43,174
(smacking)

484
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,341
(gasping)

485
00:25:50,158 --> 00:25:52,408
(slamming)

486
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,660
- Oprah or Jenny Jones?

487
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,773
- Price is Right.

488
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,311
- Cartoons?

489
00:25:59,311 --> 00:26:00,774
- That works.

490
00:26:00,774 --> 00:26:03,774
(suspenseful music)

491
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:07,450
- Sh, I'm here to help you.

492
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,100
- You're here to help me?

493
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,170
Who are you?

494
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,610
- Rogers, Justin Rogers.

495
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,670
You're Chelsea Stuart.

496
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,863
I heard the story on the radio.

497
00:26:14,863 --> 00:26:16,300
I know all about it.

498
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,450
- Where are we, Justin?

499
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:20,140
- That's a good question.

500
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,470
See, I'm lost.

501
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,303
- You're lost?

502
00:26:22,303 --> 00:26:23,280
- Shh.

503
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,340
- How can you help me if you're lost?

504
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,070
- Well I kind of know where we are.

505
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,540
We're in the Timberland National Forest.

506
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,810
- The Timberland National Forest?

507
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,560
Timberland National Forest is huge!

508
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,580
- Can you pull your arm out?

509
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,880
- [Announcer] We interrupt this program

510
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,173
for a special late breaking report.

511
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,895
A young boy is missing in the
Timberland National Forest.

512
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:44,728
(laughing)

513
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,310
This marks the first
reported disappearance

514
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,660
in the park since last--

515
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,340
- People get lost in this
forest and never come out.

516
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,880
- Don't you think your current situation

517
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,603
is a little bit more dangerous?

518
00:26:54,522 --> 00:26:55,460
- Yeah I guess.

519
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,190
- [Announcer] Justin Rogers
wandered off yesterday afternoon

520
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,050
at the mountain grocery store.

521
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,300
The store is located--

522
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,650
- Probably dead by now.

523
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,880
- Yep, coyote food.

524
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,230
(laughing)

525
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,335
- [Announcer] Here is a
recent photo of the boy.

526
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,446
(spitting)

527
00:27:09,446 --> 00:27:11,110
If you have any info on his whereabouts,

528
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,520
please contact your local authorities.

529
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,450
If you are in the Quail Pass region,

530
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:20,430
the number to call is 1-800-881-059--

531
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,263
- Got one.

532
00:27:22,848 --> 00:27:24,107
- [Perry] Come out, you little freak!

533
00:27:24,107 --> 00:27:25,963
- You're dead meat, kid,
we know who you are!

534
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,717
- He ain't in there.

535
00:27:28,717 --> 00:27:30,638
(shouting)

536
00:27:30,638 --> 00:27:33,303
(banging)

537
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:34,136
- What are you doing?

538
00:27:34,136 --> 00:27:36,533
- It's a transmitter so
we can talk to each other.

539
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,373
- Ram, ram it, ram it!

540
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,440
Come here, let me in there!

541
00:27:43,504 --> 00:27:45,671
(banging)

542
00:27:47,068 --> 00:27:47,920
- What are you doing?

543
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,651
- I know you're in there, kid!

544
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:51,697
You delinquent, I'm coming in!

545
00:27:51,697 --> 00:27:53,418
- Keep that free hand out of sight!

546
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:54,939
Bye!

547
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,217
(slamming)

548
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:58,467
(groaning)

549
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,463
- Excuse me, would you mind
getting off of me, please?

550
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,310
Now?

551
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,943
- Oh, sorry.

552
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,670
- We do appreciate all you're doing.

553
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,950
It's not that at all.

554
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,890
- [Sarge] We're doing
everything we can, ma'am.

555
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,650
- Tell them it's been almost 24 hours.

556
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,360
- They're aware of that, honey.

557
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,200
No, no, I didn't call you honey.

558
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,643
I was talking to my husband.

559
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,160
As you can understand, we're just very

560
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,610
worried about our son.

561
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,882
- [Sarge] I understand totally.

562
00:28:31,882 --> 00:28:32,715
- Couldn't you send somebody up here

563
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:34,370
just a little sooner.

564
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,220
(mumbling)

565
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,830
That would be wonderful.

566
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,140
- [Sarge] Just stay calm.

567
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,520
- We will.

568
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,362
Thank you so much.

569
00:28:41,362 --> 00:28:42,195
- [Dad] What?

570
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:43,980
- They'll have a trooper
up here by this evening.

571
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,813
- I'll believe that when I see it.

572
00:28:44,813 --> 00:28:45,650
We'd better get moving.

573
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,550
- Thank you, sweetheart.

574
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,923
We'll be back as soon
as we run out of flyers.

575
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,770
- Hold down the fort, Katie.

576
00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:55,722
- Aye aye.

577
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,850
- Lyle, I want you to call Andy

578
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,870
and tell him to get his big butt in here.

579
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,936
I need somebody go over
there to Quail Pass

580
00:29:03,936 --> 00:29:06,440
and do a report on that missing kid.

581
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,380
- Andy's big butt is in
Florida visiting his pap.

582
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,460
Sarge, maybe I can--

583
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,830
- [Sarge] Call Fred then.

584
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,920
- He's in Reno.

585
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,490
- Well how about Frank or Sisco?

586
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,890
- They're still in Frisco?

587
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,160
- Damn.

588
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,170
I got no extra men.

589
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,480
I need somebody to go over there

590
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,020
and get a report on that kid.

591
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,160
- I could go!

592
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,280
Sarge, I know I only
been here a few months

593
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,700
but I really feel I'm
ready to take the next step

594
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,267
and get some field experience.

595
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:32,434
(zapping)

596
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:35,814
- Oh lord.

597
00:29:45,252 --> 00:29:46,519
(swinging)

598
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,873
(screaming)

599
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:50,123
(plopping)

600
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,537
Lyle, I believe I will
let you take that report

601
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,930
'cause it's about the
only way I can think of

602
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,053
to keep me out of intensive care!

603
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,200
- Fugitive to prisoner.

604
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,123
Are you there?

605
00:30:19,741 --> 00:30:21,800
- I'm here.

606
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,160
- [Justin] Are they still mad?

607
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,810
- Well they've calmed down a bit.

608
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,160
At least they stopped
screaming at each other.

609
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,620
How are you?

610
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,453
- Okay.

611
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,710
I made a campfire.

612
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,057
- [Chelsea] You did?

613
00:30:33,057 --> 00:30:35,100
Are you roasting marshmallows?

614
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,800
- Pine cones, I'm out of marshmallows.

615
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,200
I'm getting pretty hungry.

616
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,033
- Me too.

617
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,780
I think they're cooking dinner.

618
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,500
I could save some for you.

619
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,723
- Thanks but that's too
risky for right now.

620
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,350
I've gotta come up with a plan.

621
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,670
I'll talk to you in a few hours.

622
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,513
Fugitive out.

623
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,810
- Fried chicken or Salisbury steak?

624
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,643
- Steak.

625
00:31:14,643 --> 00:31:15,850
Let me see the box, please.

626
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,303
Give me the other one.

627
00:31:19,303 --> 00:31:20,600
- No, you said steak, this is chicken.

628
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,433
This is mine.

629
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:23,300
- I just wanna see something.

630
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,663
Come on, come on.

631
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,978
- What are you doing?

632
00:31:31,978 --> 00:31:33,600
You're gonna break 'em.

633
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,113
- Good, they're 31 grams of fat in there.

634
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:38,483
- What?

635
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,833
- I retain fats.

636
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,940
- You what?

637
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,810
- I retain fats, I have a
slow metabolism, alright?

638
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,830
I eat them at bed, I'm a cream puff.

639
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,900
- Oh come on, they're not gonna kill you.

640
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,500
- But I told you to get
me some non-fat stuff.

641
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,011
- Well they were out of it.

642
00:31:58,011 --> 00:31:59,323
- [Kurt] No they weren't, you forgot.

643
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:03,090
- Alright, I forgot.

644
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,940
- Because you don't care.

645
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,000
Why should you?

646
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,160
You don't care about your body.

647
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,520
Why should you care about mine?

648
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,990
- Fine.

649
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,050
Starve yourself.

650
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,050
I'll eat 'em all.

651
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,450
I like fat!

652
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,227
- Give me the keys,
I'm going to the store.

653
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,820
- Eat the TV dinners!

654
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,823
- I can't!

655
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,363
- Alright, alright!

656
00:32:26,303 --> 00:32:27,136
Alright.

657
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,720
Hey, grab some of those
chocolate eclair cookies

658
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,220
if they got 'em there, please.

659
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:42,695
(crickets chirping)

660
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,730
- He doesn't understand me.

661
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:05,090
(comical music)

662
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:07,710
- Be cheerful but serious,

663
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,440
helpful but businesslike, understanding

664
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,870
but not namby pamby, neutral but intense

665
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:16,630
and lastly, knowledgeable but modest.

666
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,230
Now you got that, Lyle?

667
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,350
- Yes sir.

668
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,183
Chunk.

669
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,280
- What?

670
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,000
- Cheerful, helpful,
understanding, neutral,

671
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,833
and knowledgeable.

672
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:26,960
That spells chunk.

673
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,650
Helps me remember.

674
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:29,483
- Right.

675
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,233
Chunk.

676
00:33:34,523 --> 00:33:37,106
(upbeat music)

677
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:13,890
- Okay.

678
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,730
Folks, looks like I got all I need.

679
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:19,520
- Now we've already alerted the media

680
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,830
and we'll keep searching too.

681
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,070
If you like, we can give you a map

682
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,820
of the areas we've already covered.

683
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:32,803
Well?

684
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,063
- Ma'am, let us handle this.

685
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,663
- Well at least we got 'em out here.

686
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,180
- Congratulations my good man.

687
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,623
How does it feel to have a free
five minute shopping spree?

688
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,100
Great, thanks.

689
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,650
I think it's a good way for true savings

690
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,300
and to avoid comparison shopping.

691
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,453
Well, on your marks, ready, set, go.

692
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,320
Let's see, what do we have here.

693
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,003
Ah, breakfast foods.

694
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,003
99% fat free, see?

695
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,363
Perry?

696
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:26,263
- Please develop these
pictures of the kidnappers.

697
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,913
Thanks, Justin.

698
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,950
- Oh, this should be good for my skin.

699
00:35:35,182 --> 00:35:37,515
(whistling)

700
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:48,190
Well how do you expect me
to pay for all of this?

701
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,543
Oh, you want to pay me for shopping here?

702
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,532
Thanks.

703
00:35:53,532 --> 00:35:56,300
(dinging)

704
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,467
Figures, figures, figures.

705
00:35:59,803 --> 00:36:02,283
Oh, what do we have here?

706
00:36:02,283 --> 00:36:03,116
A camera?

707
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:08,891
(laughing)

708
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,973
Suckers!

709
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,370
You know, I like this place.

710
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,753
I think I'm gonna go shop here again.

711
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,773
Thank you, sorry about the door!

712
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,980
- Maybe we should do one
more sweep before bedtime.

713
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,290
- The trooper said we
shouldn't be out searching.

714
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,683
- So he can arrest me.

715
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,573
- Mom, dad!

716
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:48,392
- Oh honey!

717
00:36:48,392 --> 00:36:49,503
Are you alright?

718
00:36:50,562 --> 00:36:52,107
We were so worried about you, you okay?

719
00:36:52,107 --> 00:36:53,560
- You guys have to listen to me!

720
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,520
Kate, why are you hugging me?

721
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,410
- Sorry, I forgot myself.

722
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,500
- You guys gotta listen to me.

723
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,430
There is this girl and
she got kidnapped and--

724
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,831
- Just a second.

725
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:02,670
We should call the state
police and tell 'em he's here.

726
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,970
- You guys gotta listen to me.

727
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,770
Okay, you might not
believe this but it's true.

728
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,600
Yesterday when we stopped at the store,

729
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,740
I got out of our van to get some gumballs

730
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,460
but instead of getting back into our van,

731
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,490
I got into a van that
looked just like ours

732
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,530
but it belonged to these two kidnappers.

733
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,500
One guy's really short
and he talks really fast

734
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,590
and the other guy's about 10 feet tall

735
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,440
and I spent the night at
their place last night

736
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,170
but this morning they kidnapped this girl

737
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:29,610
and her dad owns Toytropolis
and we have to save her.

738
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,340
- Liar, liar, pants on fuego.

739
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,780
- I'm not lying.

740
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,900
- So this guy's 10 feet tall?

741
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,450
That's pretty tall.

742
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,280
- I didn't measure him.

743
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,520
He's just really tall, buttface.

744
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,770
- That's enough, Justin.

745
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,090
I think it's time for bed.

746
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:43,923
- [Justin] No!

747
00:37:43,923 --> 00:37:46,230
- Yes, go to your room!

748
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,310
- Why don't you believe me?

749
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,830
We have to save her!

750
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,350
- No more nonsense, Justin.

751
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,690
You are grounded.

752
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,360
You've been nothing but
a headache all weekend.

753
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,640
Now go to your room and don't come out

754
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,140
until we tell you to come out.

755
00:38:10,364 --> 00:38:12,660
- What in the hell are you doing, Lyle?

756
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,640
- Waltzing.

757
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,883
Taking Shirley to a dance on Sunday.

758
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,199
Could you do me a favor, Lyle?

759
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,210
Could you pick up that pencil?

760
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,173
I dropped it.

761
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:31,200
(ripping)

762
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,512
- Oh no.

763
00:38:32,512 --> 00:38:34,256
(laughing)

764
00:38:34,256 --> 00:38:35,257
- What happened?

765
00:38:35,257 --> 00:38:36,963
Did you tear your pants again, Lyle?

766
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:43,110
(phone ringing)

767
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,383
42, how can I help you?

768
00:38:44,383 --> 00:38:45,570
- [Danny] This is Danny Rogers.

769
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,300
- Oh, hello, Mr. Rogers.

770
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,829
How are things in your neighborhood?

771
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:50,740
(laughing)

772
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,950
Quite a joke, huh?

773
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,783
- [Danny] Funny.

774
00:38:52,783 --> 00:38:53,616
- [Sarge] I'm sorry,
I'm just a little full

775
00:38:53,616 --> 00:38:54,840
of the devil tonight.

776
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,680
- [Danny] Justin came home.

777
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,600
- [Sarge] Oh he did, did he?

778
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,978
- [Danny] Yes.

779
00:38:57,978 --> 00:38:58,811
- Well hold on, let me get a pencil

780
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:00,313
so I can cancel the search.

781
00:39:09,077 --> 00:39:11,410
(whistling)

782
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,270
Well that's great news, Mr. Rogers.

783
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,840
Yeah, we're real pleased
that the little brat,

784
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,024
uh, (mumbling) is back.

785
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:23,067
(whoopee cushion rumbling)

786
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:24,420
(laughing)

787
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,615
Uh, no sir, I meant no disrespect.

788
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:27,725
- [Danny] Then what was that?

789
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:28,670
- Don't know what that was.

790
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,800
- [Danny] Are you making fun of me?

791
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,800
- Uh, no sir, I'm not making fun of you.

792
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,247
If we can be of any further service to you

793
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:37,994
during the rest of your
vacation, you please call us.

794
00:39:37,994 --> 00:39:40,610
(laughing)

795
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,543
Shut up.

796
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:46,290
The little Rogers boy
is back home safe again.

797
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,320
- I sure did get you back
good, didn't I, Sarge?

798
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,800
- I hate it when you do that!

799
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,377
- I sure did get you good, didn't I?

800
00:39:57,346 --> 00:39:59,679
(splatting)

801
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:05,473
- Lord, give me strength with this child.

802
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,530
- [Danny] Maybe we shouldn't
have put him on probation.

803
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,970
- I don't know where he gets this stuff.

804
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:13,060
Just seems so out there.

805
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,763
- He's back, he's in bed.

806
00:40:14,763 --> 00:40:16,243
We'll worry about it tomorrow.

807
00:40:18,906 --> 00:40:21,573
(comical music)

808
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:49,460
- [Justin Voiceover]
Dear mom, dad, and Kate.

809
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,360
I'm sorry I have to do
this because I know you're

810
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,600
gonna be mad but Chelsea needs help

811
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,570
and I promise I'll be careful

812
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:58,660
but if I don't come back, I'm sorry

813
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,290
in advance for all the
trouble I've caused you.

814
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,283
Love Justin.

815
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,453
Very special.

816
00:41:16,138 --> 00:41:17,388
Best Stuf Glue.

817
00:41:22,278 --> 00:41:23,111
Cool.

818
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,693
- Boy, do I have plans for you.

819
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,453
Chelsea, are you awake?

820
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,690
- Yeah, where are you?

821
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:58,050
- I can't reveal that in
case someone's eavesdropping.

822
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:58,890
- [Chelsea] I understand.

823
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,211
Are you okay?

824
00:42:00,211 --> 00:42:01,690
- Yeah, are you?

825
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:03,533
- No, I've been kidnapped!

826
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,760
Did you find some food?

827
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,460
- Yeah, my mom made me dinner.

828
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,930
- You saw your parents?

829
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,457
- [Justin] Yeah, I went back to our cabin.

830
00:42:11,457 --> 00:42:13,410
- Well did you tell them?

831
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,840
- [Justin] I tried to.

832
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,280
- [Chelsea] What'd they say?

833
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,223
- Looks like we're alone in
the woods on this one, Chelsea.

834
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,110
- I'm not playing games, does it

835
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,583
sound like I'm playing games?

836
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,330
Don't tell me you ain't
got that kind of money.

837
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,880
All you rich millionaires
got it hidden around.

838
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,560
No, I won't take a gift
certificate to Toytropolis.

839
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,590
I want one million
dollars in unmarked bills

840
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,740
by three tomorrow or
she dies, that's that.

841
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,220
- I really hate that kid.

842
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,260
- What?

843
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,811
I said three, are you deaf?

844
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:42,811
Three, three, three!

845
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,440
Oh, sorry, p.m.

846
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,023
(upbeat music)

847
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,420
- He owns 500 toy stores.

848
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,190
He's gotta have the cash.

849
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:57,240
- Sure, sure, he's got it.

850
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,231
He's just toying with us.

851
00:43:59,231 --> 00:44:00,500
Granted, we're in a recession year

852
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,680
and many consumers are reluctant

853
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,070
to spend rather than maintain some degree

854
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,710
of fiscal solvency, but
Stu Stuart's got a lot

855
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,330
and I want a piece of it.

856
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:08,820
- What if he don't pay?

857
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,720
- We're men of our word, we whack her.

858
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,640
Why, you got a problem with that?

859
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,473
- No.

860
00:44:16,473 --> 00:44:17,480
- Good 'cause I don't.

861
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,237
I'd rather be a cowardly sociopathic,

862
00:44:19,237 --> 00:44:22,070
morally bankrupt murderer
than a hypocrite.

863
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,020
It's important to me.

864
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,420
A man's gotta keep his word.

865
00:44:33,793 --> 00:44:36,346
(horn blaring)

866
00:44:36,346 --> 00:44:38,099
What was that?

867
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,422
Quick, go see what it was.

868
00:44:40,422 --> 00:44:43,505
- You find out, I gotta hit the head.

869
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,033
- I don't see nothing.

870
00:44:50,847 --> 00:44:51,680
Whoa!

871
00:44:59,883 --> 00:45:01,633
- First boob trapped.

872
00:45:10,539 --> 00:45:12,789
(laughing)

873
00:45:29,033 --> 00:45:29,866
- You bum.

874
00:45:36,203 --> 00:45:38,453
(shouting)

875
00:45:42,731 --> 00:45:44,042
Perry!

876
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:45,704
I need some TP!

877
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:46,621
- That kid.

878
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:52,060
(dramatic music)

879
00:46:00,687 --> 00:46:03,571
- We have ignition, Houston.

880
00:46:03,571 --> 00:46:06,762
(flare firing)

881
00:46:06,762 --> 00:46:08,762
- What an unusual sound.

882
00:46:12,618 --> 00:46:13,451
Uh-oh.

883
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:16,650
(yelling)

884
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:21,406
- Bullseye.

885
00:46:23,137 --> 00:46:24,460
- [Kurt] Oh, my ass!

886
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,293
My ass!

887
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:27,036
- Hey, hey!

888
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,103
Wait, wait!

889
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:43,057
Holy gee!

890
00:46:43,057 --> 00:46:44,695
- Stop (mumbling), Perry.

891
00:46:44,695 --> 00:46:47,560
- [Perry] Your butt's smoking!

892
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,700
- We don't have much time.

893
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,990
- What was all that screaming?

894
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,823
- It's the big guy.

895
00:46:50,823 --> 00:46:52,143
He is not in a good mood.

896
00:46:54,782 --> 00:46:57,450
- [Kurt] Do something, do something!

897
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:58,300
- They're coming!

898
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,520
- Yes!

899
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,353
Front door.

900
00:47:12,886 --> 00:47:15,219
Jump the porch, it's rigged.

901
00:47:16,103 --> 00:47:18,115
- Hey, come back here!

902
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:20,365
(shouting)

903
00:47:24,307 --> 00:47:25,420
You run away, kid!

904
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,110
You're signing your own death warrant!

905
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,870
I guarantee it!

906
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:33,870
- [Kurt] I guarantee it myself!

907
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,223
- Honey, Thanksgiving's
a day to be thankful.

908
00:47:44,882 --> 00:47:45,715
- I am thankful, there's not one

909
00:47:45,715 --> 00:47:48,110
but two good football games on today.

910
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:51,500
- Well, I thought we'd spend
the day together as a family.

911
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,900
- Agreed, call the kids.

912
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,228
They'll miss the opening kickoff.

913
00:47:55,228 --> 00:47:56,330
(laughing)

914
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:57,280
- That's not funny.

915
00:48:02,778 --> 00:48:05,770
- [Reporter] And now an
eyewitness news flash.

916
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:09,310
The search continues for
16 year old Chelsea Stuart,

917
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:12,690
daughter of billionaire
toy magnate Stu Stuart.

918
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,580
She was kidnapped a day and a half ago

919
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:17,510
from St. Mary's Academy Boarding School.

920
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:19,540
Here's a photograph of the suspects

921
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,750
taken by an anonymous photographer

922
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,593
known only as Justin.

923
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,613
- [Both] Justin?

924
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,743
- Justin, get up.

925
00:48:32,191 --> 00:48:33,532
- Oh my God.

926
00:48:33,532 --> 00:48:36,670
- [Katie] Look, he left a note.

927
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:37,700
- I know this sounds outrageous

928
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,100
but the fact is he's gone again

929
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,550
and he left a note saying he's going

930
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,020
to rescue this Chelsea Stuart.

931
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:42,853
- [Sarge] You're pulling my leg,

932
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:43,830
ain't you, Mr. Rogers?

933
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,730
- No, I'm serious.

934
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,000
What do you think I am, a liar?

935
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,413
- [Sarge] Hey, there ain't no
reason to get rude about it.

936
00:48:48,413 --> 00:48:50,190
- Give me the phone.

937
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:53,090
Hi, this is Ms. Rogers.

938
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:54,480
Yes, like we told the officer

939
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,850
that came last night--

940
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,097
- [Sarge] Won't you be my neighbor?

941
00:48:57,097 --> 00:48:57,930
(laughing)

942
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,190
- Won't I be your neighbor?

943
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:01,077
- [Sarge] Sorry, couldn't resist that one.

944
00:49:01,077 --> 00:49:02,224
- Oh.

945
00:49:02,224 --> 00:49:05,170
Oh yes, that's very funny.

946
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:06,140
- [Sarge] Bet you never heard that one.

947
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,370
- Yeah, no, I never heard that one before.

948
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:10,420
I'm sorry I'm lacking in sense of humor.

949
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,640
It's just that I think my son may be

950
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,890
in a great deal of danger.

951
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,256
- [Sarge] Well Mr. Rogers said he

952
00:49:14,256 --> 00:49:15,089
had a whopping imagination.

953
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:16,123
- Yes, I know my husband told you

954
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:18,040
that Justin has a big imagination

955
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,970
but I'm really sure that
he is not making this up.

956
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:22,260
- [Sarge] Sorry ma'am,
I don't have anybody

957
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,130
to send out there right now.

958
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,100
- Well when can you have someone up here?

959
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,693
- [Sarge] It's Thanksgiving
weekend, Ms. Rogers.

960
00:49:26,693 --> 00:49:29,210
- Yes, I know it's Thanksgiving.

961
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:30,377
- [Sarge] Well then you know half my guys

962
00:49:30,377 --> 00:49:31,303
are off celebrating.

963
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:34,500
- Listen, we pay our taxes,
we obey the speed limit.

964
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,990
We watch COPS.

965
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:38,140
How about sending someone
up here right now?

966
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,781
- [Sarge] Hey, don't
have a cow on me, ma'am.

967
00:49:40,781 --> 00:49:42,241
- I'm sorry.

968
00:49:42,241 --> 00:49:43,074
I'm sorry.

969
00:49:43,074 --> 00:49:45,108
I'm just a little tense.

970
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:46,320
- [Sarge] Well as soon
as possible we'll make--

971
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,790
- Yes, oh, yes, as soon as possible

972
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:50,389
would be absolutely wonderful.

973
00:49:50,389 --> 00:49:51,393
Thank you.

974
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,003
- The kid's gone again.

975
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,393
Damn it, Lyle, you are
a magnet for disaster.

976
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:15,850
Get your stuff, you're
going back to Quail Pass.

977
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:16,793
- Right, sarge.

978
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:24,020
- You're not going like that are you?

979
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,693
Get over here.

980
00:50:25,693 --> 00:50:26,893
I'll help you pull it off.

981
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,180
I want you to call Emmitt at 38

982
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,930
and tell him we might need some of his men

983
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,120
for a search party.

984
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:34,953
- Right.

985
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,907
- Hey, hey, sit on the table.

986
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,530
Alright, put your foot in my chest.

987
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,380
In my chest!

988
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,610
Alright, on three, you ready?

989
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:50,463
One, two, three.

990
00:50:51,664 --> 00:50:53,997
(screaming)

991
00:50:58,814 --> 00:51:01,953
Oh!

992
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,773
- It's stuck to my chest hairs.

993
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,723
- I have absolutely no response to that.

994
00:51:11,723 --> 00:51:14,090
- I want you to drive
up and down the road.

995
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:15,960
That's their only easy way out.

996
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,380
And then I'm gonna call
in the secret weapon.

997
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,970
- The secret weapon?

998
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:20,803
- The tracker.

999
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,357
- Who's the tracker?

1000
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:24,773
- No one really knows.

1001
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:28,220
But he can sniff a mouse
fart from outer space.

1002
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,560
I'll never forget the first
time I ever met the tracker.

1003
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,640
It was many years ago.

1004
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,290
I hired him to do a little
investigative work for me.

1005
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:41,980
He possessed a keen sense of smell

1006
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,053
and an uncanny knack for finding things.

1007
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,300
He also had a very
complicated wrist watch.

1008
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,153
He was a master of the unexpected.

1009
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:57,120
He searched for what
seemed like an eternity

1010
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,993
until my closet could yield no more.

1011
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,690
I was worried.

1012
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:02,853
No, pensive.

1013
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,560
But the tracker came through for me.

1014
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:11,410
I probably wouldn't recognize him today

1015
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:15,290
but he'll get them back and fast.

1016
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,383
He's gonna cost us.

1017
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,200
But it'll be worth it.

1018
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,387
- Oh yeah, it'll be worth it.

1019
00:52:22,918 --> 00:52:23,970
- Okay, we got about
three hours til sundown.

1020
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:24,803
Let's get to it.

1021
00:52:24,803 --> 00:52:25,740
Kate, you got the map?

1022
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:26,743
- Sir, yes sir.

1023
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,903
- [Danny] Come on, hurry up, let's go.

1024
00:52:31,909 --> 00:52:33,059
- [Katie] Stop it, dad.

1025
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:35,217
Woo!

1026
00:52:36,304 --> 00:52:37,850
- [Mom] Honey, take it easy.

1027
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:53,723
- Chelsea.

1028
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,200
I'm pretty sure but I'm not totally sure

1029
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,540
that we're going in the right direction.

1030
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,960
- I thought you did?

1031
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,340
- So did I but when I
came up here last time,

1032
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,610
I took the main road.

1033
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:07,510
This is different.

1034
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:11,089
I'm kind of confused.

1035
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,240
- It's okay, Justin.

1036
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:16,067
I have no clue where we are either.

1037
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,770
Do you remember what
direction the highway is?

1038
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:21,150
- West.

1039
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:23,560
- [Chelsea] Let me see your
facilitator, the radio.

1040
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,600
- Why?

1041
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,555
- We need the compass.

1042
00:53:26,555 --> 00:53:27,805
- What compass?

1043
00:53:38,384 --> 00:53:39,690
Whoa, how did you know that?

1044
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:42,464
- My dad tested it out on me
when they were researching it.

1045
00:53:42,464 --> 00:53:44,800
One of the developers told
me about the secret compass.

1046
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,400
- You got to test toys?

1047
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,810
- Well I lived away from
home since I was 10.

1048
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,290
Prep schools.

1049
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:51,420
Almost every day there'd be something new

1050
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,460
on my doorstep to play with.

1051
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,293
- Every day?

1052
00:53:55,409 --> 00:53:56,326
Dominators?

1053
00:53:57,185 --> 00:53:58,250
- Twice a week.

1054
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:01,350
Die-bots, video games
from the Valkyrie system.

1055
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,430
You name it, I had it.

1056
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:05,200
I have toys that haven't
even come out yet.

1057
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,870
- You're a luck out.

1058
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:07,703
- Guess so.

1059
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,360
- Thank god he had the
sense to take the tent.

1060
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,950
- You see anything?

1061
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:18,400
- Not yet.

1062
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,783
- I see a lot of trees.

1063
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,520
- Let's try another road.

1064
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,547
Kate, mark this one off.

1065
00:54:27,725 --> 00:54:29,025
- It's gonna be dark soon.

1066
00:54:34,025 --> 00:54:35,610
- Perry.

1067
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:37,923
I can't believe the kid
short sheeted the bed.

1068
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:40,373
I feel so violated.

1069
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,253
I'm so stressed out I can't sleep.

1070
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,160
- Tell me about it.

1071
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,460
You just can't kidnap
like you used to anymore.

1072
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,063
There's always some fly in the ointment

1073
00:54:50,063 --> 00:54:52,250
messing up the whole bowl of wax.

1074
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,083
- Perry.

1075
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:56,943
My butt is killing me.

1076
00:55:22,895 --> 00:55:25,895
(suspenseful music)

1077
00:55:44,811 --> 00:55:46,000
Are you the tracker?

1078
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,970
- I am.

1079
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:48,580
- The same tracker that
uncovered (mumbling)

1080
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,610
72 Chevy Impala 20 years
after it disappeared

1081
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:53,200
from the Bakersfield, California
Rotary Club parking lot?

1082
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,033
- The same.

1083
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,220
- What color was it?

1084
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,480
- White with a black vinyl roof.

1085
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,373
Rally pin stripes, pewter interior.

1086
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,435
- Let's make a deal.

1087
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:13,268
- Alright.

1088
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:21,983
- Alright.

1089
00:56:23,155 --> 00:56:25,170
(mumbling) seasoned steel belted radios.

1090
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:27,603
Sheep skinned seat covers,
pine tree deodorizer.

1091
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,883
16 head of corn fed cattle.

1092
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,223
One pregnant sow?

1093
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,273
Flannel bedsheets.

1094
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:38,741
Is that all?

1095
00:56:38,741 --> 00:56:39,891
- You forgot something.

1096
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,920
- Oh yeah.

1097
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,120
15 cases of diet cola.

1098
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,193
- Caffeine free.

1099
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,900
- [Perry] The bottom yellow copy is yours.

1100
00:56:59,160 --> 00:56:59,993
Hey.

1101
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:03,933
Blanket.

1102
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,150
- We had her wrapped in
there for four hours.

1103
00:57:11,203 --> 00:57:13,453
(sniffing)

1104
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,730
- You are one weird hombre.

1105
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:28,570
- Don't judge me because

1106
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,920
of my super advanced olfactory nerves.

1107
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:31,753
- Ol-what?

1108
00:57:40,445 --> 00:57:42,140
- We're gonna split up into two groups.

1109
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,460
I'm gonna go this way by myself.

1110
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,730
Kate, you take your mom in the car

1111
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:46,940
and make sure she remembers
she's eight months pregnant.

1112
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:47,773
- Roger, Mr. Rogers.

1113
00:57:47,773 --> 00:57:49,700
- We're gonna meet back
here every 30 minutes.

1114
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,030
We're gonna keep this up until the police

1115
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:52,770
search rescue team comes, alright?

1116
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:53,603
Ready?

1117
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:54,830
- Honey, be careful.

1118
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:55,890
- You too.

1119
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:58,467
Get some rest when you need to.

1120
00:57:58,467 --> 00:57:59,717
Justin, Justin!

1121
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:05,130
(dramatic music)

1122
00:58:25,847 --> 00:58:28,920
- Sarge, ain't we a little
far away from the group.

1123
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,370
- That's the whole point
of spreading out, Lyle.

1124
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:32,940
We can cover more ground that way.

1125
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,208
- Oh.

1126
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:35,490
- Speaking of which, why don't you

1127
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,860
go off down over there and I'll go up

1128
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:38,973
off over this way.

1129
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:43,040
- But then I'd be alone.

1130
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,910
- That's the general idea.

1131
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:46,660
Don't worry, we'll connect up later

1132
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,860
somewhere down the road.

1133
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,223
- Hello, little lost boy?

1134
00:59:00,527 --> 00:59:02,777
(groaning)

1135
00:59:05,348 --> 00:59:06,181
I'm stuck!

1136
00:59:15,814 --> 00:59:17,899
(screaming)

1137
00:59:17,899 --> 00:59:19,687
- What are you doing?

1138
00:59:19,687 --> 00:59:22,123
- I'm stuck, can you help me?

1139
00:59:25,071 --> 00:59:26,953
- Did you say you needed help?

1140
00:59:31,407 --> 00:59:32,240
Hang on!

1141
00:59:38,428 --> 00:59:39,593
- I can't!

1142
00:59:39,593 --> 00:59:41,846
- We're almost home!

1143
00:59:41,846 --> 00:59:44,779
- [Lyle] I'm so tired!

1144
00:59:44,779 --> 00:59:46,112
- You can reach!

1145
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:48,933
Yeah!

1146
00:59:50,578 --> 00:59:51,411
Let's go!

1147
00:59:55,688 --> 00:59:57,105
Come on, come on!

1148
01:00:01,719 --> 01:00:02,552
- Lyle!

1149
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,850
Hey, Lyle, what the hell is going on here?

1150
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:07,910
- Oh nothing, Sarge.

1151
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:10,130
This nice gentleman just saved me.

1152
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:11,543
- All in a days work, amigo.

1153
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:15,650
- We're looking for a missing kid.

1154
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:18,233
You didn't happen to see one, did you?

1155
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:22,340
- Kid, blonde hair, about 10 years old?

1156
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:23,460
About yay high?

1157
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:24,293
- Exactly.

1158
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,320
- Nope, can't say that I have, sorry.

1159
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,020
- Huh, well.

1160
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,500
If you happen to run up on him,

1161
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,010
you'll give us a call, won't you?

1162
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:34,843
- Sure.

1163
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:35,676
- Come on, Lyle.

1164
01:00:35,676 --> 01:00:36,509
Let's go back to the office.

1165
01:00:36,509 --> 01:00:37,820
It's getting late and
we'll get another run

1166
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:38,653
at it tomorrow.

1167
01:00:38,653 --> 01:00:39,486
- Thanks, mister.

1168
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,630
- You got any candy bars left?

1169
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:44,603
- No, we're out.

1170
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,260
My parents are gonna kill me.

1171
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,170
- Aren't you tired?

1172
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:52,553
- Yeah but I think we should keep going.

1173
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,318
- What?

1174
01:01:11,318 --> 01:01:13,120
- I thought I heard something.

1175
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,707
(honking)

1176
01:01:14,707 --> 01:01:15,707
The highway!

1177
01:01:24,517 --> 01:01:26,045
- I can see it!

1178
01:01:26,045 --> 01:01:27,935
(shouting)

1179
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,952
(groaning)

1180
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:30,843
- That wasn't very nice!

1181
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,330
(groaning)

1182
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,290
- Justin, you gotta run!

1183
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:47,817
- I'm not gonna leave you!

1184
01:01:47,817 --> 01:01:49,213
- [Chelsea] Go, run, get away!

1185
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:57,530
- Leave her alone!

1186
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:58,933
- Just doing my job, sparky.

1187
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:04,173
- Well you have to get
past me first, dirt bag.

1188
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,723
- [Perry] You think you're
pretty cool, don't you?

1189
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,690
- Lay off him, you cretin!

1190
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:24,070
- Shut up, brat.

1191
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:26,130
Hey Justin, you always
wanted to hang with us.

1192
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,822
Well now here's your chance.

1193
01:02:27,822 --> 01:02:30,072
(laughing)

1194
01:02:31,837 --> 01:02:32,670
(phone ringing)

1195
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:33,503
Give me that.

1196
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:36,893
Yeah.

1197
01:02:37,855 --> 01:02:40,140
You gonna play ball with me, hotshot?

1198
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,930
Good, you're smarter
than I thought you were.

1199
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:45,170
You get the coordinates for the air drop?

1200
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:47,260
Alright, now remember.

1201
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:49,513
If the law shows up, she dies.

1202
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:56,427
- Justin!

1203
01:02:56,427 --> 01:02:57,260
- Justin!

1204
01:02:58,708 --> 01:02:59,541
- Justin!

1205
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,433
- Justin!

1206
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:04,180
We're never gonna find him, mom.

1207
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,640
We've been driving around for two hours

1208
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,680
yelling our heads off.

1209
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,570
- Well we can't give up, Kate.

1210
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:09,680
We'll find him.

1211
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,263
- Needle in a haystack, mom.

1212
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:13,420
- [Mom] Honey, pick that up.

1213
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:16,090
You know how I feel about littering.

1214
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:17,040
- I didn't drop it.

1215
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,143
It's Justin's handwriting.

1216
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:27,883
Mom, it's a map.

1217
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:33,240
- Look kid, while Kurt
and I are in Bermuda

1218
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,060
lying in a bed of a million dollars,

1219
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,960
I'll be thinking of you
hanging here, starving,

1220
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,480
crying like a baby.

1221
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,636
Then I'll eat a plate of
nachos and I'll laugh.

1222
01:03:42,636 --> 01:03:43,820
(laughing)

1223
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,440
Well, it's been fun
but we got a money drop

1224
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,160
in the clearing and a plane to catch.

1225
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,083
See you around.

1226
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,420
- Later, dude.

1227
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,760
- You'll be okay, Justin.

1228
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,010
I'll get someone here
to help you, I promise.

1229
01:03:59,507 --> 01:04:02,507
(suspenseful music)

1230
01:04:05,576 --> 01:04:06,810
- [Danny] Which way, right or left?

1231
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:07,900
- It's hard to tell.

1232
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,660
His drawing is really bad.

1233
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:10,520
- Pick one.

1234
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,353
- There it is.

1235
01:04:31,215 --> 01:04:32,680
- Oh Justin!

1236
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,863
Oh, baby.

1237
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,390
You've got to stop doing this.

1238
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:40,490
I feel like I've got a thousand ulcers.

1239
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:42,260
- I'm sorry, mom, I'm really sorry.

1240
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:44,050
- No, no, I'm the one that's sorry.

1241
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:46,060
I'm sorry we didn't listen to you.

1242
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:48,210
- Mom, the kidnappers took Chelsea.

1243
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:49,810
- Oh my god.

1244
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:51,360
- You have to help me save her.

1245
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,800
- Baby, I'm not the bionic woman.

1246
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,963
- Mom, please?

1247
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,240
- Katy, I need you to stay
here and call the police.

1248
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,260
- But I wanna help.

1249
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,080
- Do what your mom says,
that's how you can help.

1250
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,160
Tell them where we're going.

1251
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,333
- Where are you going?

1252
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:09,343
- The clearing.

1253
01:05:09,343 --> 01:05:10,176
- The clearing.

1254
01:05:17,792 --> 01:05:19,023
- Brilliant, no phone.

1255
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,173
- Have a seat.

1256
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,553
I said sit.

1257
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:47,656
- There she is right on time.

1258
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,930
Yes siree, there's nothing

1259
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:00,010
like the smell of racks
of money in the morning.

1260
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:01,293
- Ain't that beautiful?

1261
01:06:03,495 --> 01:06:04,545
- Is this seat taken?

1262
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:10,603
It's the hat, isn't it?

1263
01:06:10,603 --> 01:06:11,990
Sorry.

1264
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:14,460
- Perry, five bucks I can catch it.

1265
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:15,293
- You're on.

1266
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:18,983
Sheesh.

1267
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:22,723
- You're uptight, I understand, of course.

1268
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:25,320
I mean we didn't exactly meet

1269
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,558
under ideal circumstances, did we?

1270
01:06:27,558 --> 01:06:30,050
(laughing)

1271
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:31,400
I guess what I'm really trying to say

1272
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:35,583
is I'm vulnerable, vulnerable but ready.

1273
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:38,310
I'm an open book, aren't I?

1274
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:39,530
Do you like opera?

1275
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:40,693
I love opera.

1276
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:44,333
- I have a boyfriend,
we're pretty serious.

1277
01:06:46,388 --> 01:06:47,221
- Okay.

1278
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,840
- Hey Kurt!

1279
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,520
Your socks are untied.

1280
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,353
- What socks?

1281
01:07:02,834 --> 01:07:04,014
(groaning)

1282
01:07:04,014 --> 01:07:06,890
(laughing)

1283
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:07,723
- Look.

1284
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:13,120
You ever get lonely or you
ever just feel like talking,

1285
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,593
as friends of course,

1286
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:20,110
have a cappuccino maybe
or a latte, call me

1287
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:21,600
and my beeper number's on there

1288
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,353
or feel free to drop me a fax.

1289
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:28,923
- Jackpot.

1290
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:31,603
Come on.

1291
01:07:33,419 --> 01:07:35,040
Let's go.

1292
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:35,873
Take this.

1293
01:07:39,643 --> 01:07:41,358
Alright girly, let's beat it.

1294
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:43,520
- You spaz's got what
you wanted, let me go.

1295
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,030
- Do I look like a total moron?

1296
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:45,940
Don't answer that.

1297
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:48,680
You're gonna be our million
dollar insurance policy.

1298
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,443
Hey, hey, watch it with the money.

1299
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:54,220
- And you're sure this is the
only road coming out of here?

1300
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,773
- Yeah, pretty sure.

1301
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:59,630
Did we have a plan?

1302
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:01,303
- Yeah, I've got an idea.

1303
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:04,580
- [Justin] Alright mom!

1304
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,383
- [Mom] Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

1305
01:08:13,075 --> 01:08:13,908
- Hello.

1306
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,340
Baker one nine, this is radical chick.

1307
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:30,473
I've got an emergency.

1308
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:34,063
Hello, is anybody there?

1309
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,403
Breaker breaker.

1310
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:40,490
I repeat, I have an emergency situation.

1311
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:42,880
Hello?

1312
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:43,713
Hello?

1313
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:45,863
10-4 on a 10-20.

1314
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:49,913
(mumbling)

1315
01:08:49,913 --> 01:08:51,746
- Lyle, what the hell?

1316
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,613
- My leg's asleep!

1317
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,830
- [Katie] Hello?

1318
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:58,620
I'm wearing a bikini.

1319
01:08:58,620 --> 01:08:59,453
Hello?

1320
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:05,880
- [Mom] Okay, here they come.

1321
01:09:08,813 --> 01:09:10,590
Yoo-hoo, hi, hello!

1322
01:09:10,590 --> 01:09:11,866
Over here!

1323
01:09:11,866 --> 01:09:13,305
Hi!

1324
01:09:13,305 --> 01:09:14,466
- What the hell?

1325
01:09:14,466 --> 01:09:15,299
- Hi.

1326
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:21,540
We have a flat and we
don't know how to fix it.

1327
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:24,070
- We'd really appreciate your help.

1328
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:25,170
- How dumb can you be?

1329
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:28,810
- We're really sorry to trouble you

1330
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:31,557
but we're from the city,
we're not from around here

1331
01:09:31,557 --> 01:09:33,257
and we don't know what we're doing

1332
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:36,823
and I shouldn't lift anything heavy.

1333
01:09:48,126 --> 01:09:49,302
- Justin!

1334
01:09:49,302 --> 01:09:50,135
- Shh.

1335
01:09:52,447 --> 01:09:54,140
- This is a jack.

1336
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:55,640
It is used to raise the vehicle

1337
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,400
so you can change the tire.

1338
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,633
It goes like so.

1339
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,036
- Oh!

1340
01:10:02,036 --> 01:10:05,463
You know, I always wondered
what those little things were.

1341
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,910
Now what does this thing do?

1342
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:11,423
- It loosens the nuts, lady.

1343
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:15,893
- What are nuts?

1344
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:19,530
- You know much about cars?

1345
01:10:19,530 --> 01:10:22,410
- I used to work at Sears
for a couple of years.

1346
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:24,945
Tune ups, tire changes, shoe department.

1347
01:10:24,945 --> 01:10:26,750
- I'm having a little
trouble with my gas cap.

1348
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,070
Wanna look at it for me?

1349
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:28,903
- [Tracker] Sure.

1350
01:10:28,903 --> 01:10:30,450
- [Danny] It's been making
a strange rattling noise.

1351
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:32,473
- [Perry] Hey, give me that.

1352
01:10:32,473 --> 01:10:33,640
What a banana.

1353
01:10:36,045 --> 01:10:38,545
- [Justin] Come on, follow me.

1354
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:42,180
- Ah, what you got here
is a loose gas cap.

1355
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:43,013
Ow.

1356
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:46,040
- Time's a-wasting, let's get going.

1357
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,730
Look, lady, I'm sorry but we cannot

1358
01:10:47,730 --> 01:10:49,210
teach you the most fundamental task

1359
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:50,583
in the automotive world.

1360
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:53,907
- Wait, I think there's
something wrong with the motor.

1361
01:10:53,907 --> 01:10:56,380
- [Perry] Lady, I told
you, we gotta get going.

1362
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:58,040
- Alright everybody, hold it.

1363
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,763
You, come over here.

1364
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,633
Yeah, you.

1365
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:04,190
Drop it.

1366
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:05,163
I said drop it!

1367
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:08,080
- [Perry] Kurt, what's going on?

1368
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,600
- We've been tricked, that's what.

1369
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,040
- Oh well, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1370
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,413
- Come over here, come, come.

1371
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:20,984
- [Danny] Hey, take it easy.

1372
01:11:20,984 --> 01:11:22,230
- Of all the dirty things.

1373
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:24,693
Wait a minute, I smell a rotten egg.

1374
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,330
Where's the kid?

1375
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:28,203
- [Mom] What kid?

1376
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,720
- Hey kid!

1377
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,680
You better come out or we're gonna

1378
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,120
blow a hole in your mother!

1379
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,233
- Wait, don't shoot!

1380
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:39,400
- Ah!

1381
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,922
You thought you had us!

1382
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:42,790
Well you thought wrong, pipsqueak.

1383
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:45,310
- No, please sir, don't kill my mom.

1384
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:49,688
She's very sick and she
doesn't have many months left.

1385
01:11:49,688 --> 01:11:51,988
We're hoping she'll make
it through the birth.

1386
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,270
- You're full of it, kid, she ain't sick.

1387
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:59,180
- No, really, she's got hypercalisthenia,

1388
01:12:00,339 --> 01:12:02,920
a very debilitating
and contagious disease.

1389
01:12:04,218 --> 01:12:05,900
(coughing)

1390
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:06,850
- [Perry] What are you waiting for?

1391
01:12:06,850 --> 01:12:07,920
Waste her!

1392
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,030
- Nice try, kid, you're dead.

1393
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:11,810
- Don't you think you're gonna need this?

1394
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:13,520
- [Kurt] Hey, don't do that!

1395
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,165
- Alright, nobody move!

1396
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,250
- Uh-oh.

1397
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,010
- Get over there, get over
there, get over there!

1398
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:22,040
You didn't account for this
now did you, smart boy?

1399
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,240
Huh, you think I'd be stupid enough

1400
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,940
to leave the house without my gun?

1401
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:29,440
The question is who am
I gonna shoot first?

1402
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,540
Engine, engine, number nine.

1403
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:33,600
Going down Chicago line.

1404
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,610
If the train goes off the tracks,

1405
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:38,690
do you want your money back?

1406
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:42,440
Y-E-S spells yes and you are not the--

1407
01:12:45,205 --> 01:12:47,070
- Alright Kate!

1408
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:48,670
- Alright, let her go, you creep.

1409
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:50,650
One false move and you'll
become just another victim

1410
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:51,903
of an angry teenager.

1411
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:55,660
- [Justin] We did it!

1412
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:57,670
- [Danny] We sure did, son.

1413
01:12:57,670 --> 01:12:58,710
- [Katie] You okay, mom?

1414
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,440
- [Mom] I'm fine, sweetie.

1415
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,653
- Major bummer.

1416
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:05,290
I'm telling you, you got the wrong guy.

1417
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:07,300
They're the crazy ones.

1418
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:11,030
This is a postcard of a
dysfunctional American family.

1419
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:12,400
- Have fun in prison!

1420
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,520
- Oh screw you.

1421
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,170
- Frankly, your son's an
ass, he has no manners!

1422
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,900
You people must live in a barn!

1423
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:20,260
Secondly, we'll be back, just you wait!

1424
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:21,093
Hey, watch it.

1425
01:13:23,323 --> 01:13:25,010
(sniffing)

1426
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:26,260
- I can't smell anything!

1427
01:13:27,574 --> 01:13:32,101
- I hate you, you miserable
little punk, I hate you!

1428
01:13:32,101 --> 01:13:34,434
(screaming)

1429
01:13:35,334 --> 01:13:37,584
(laughing)

1430
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:00,543
- Is he coming?

1431
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,333
- Supposedly.

1432
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:05,373
- Gumball?

1433
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,153
- Thanks.

1434
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:13,050
You know something, Justin?

1435
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:14,083
You're really lucky.

1436
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,110
Not many kids' parents would do

1437
01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:17,160
what yours did today.

1438
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:19,380
- Yeah.

1439
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:20,760
I guess not.

1440
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,110
- Something to think about.

1441
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:24,020
He's here!

1442
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:24,853
- Whoa!

1443
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,133
- Hi hon.

1444
01:14:33,164 --> 01:14:34,279
You alright?

1445
01:14:34,279 --> 01:14:35,112
You need to see a doctor or anything?

1446
01:14:35,112 --> 01:14:37,680
- No, I'm fine, really.

1447
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,380
- I'm so relieved you're safe.

1448
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:42,534
- It's good to see you, dad.

1449
01:14:42,534 --> 01:14:44,023
- I got here as quick as I could.

1450
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:47,943
And you, young man.

1451
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:51,130
I don't know how to thank you.

1452
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,360
But I think I do know
how to make it up to you.

1453
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,110
I see you like the facilitator XL model.

1454
01:14:58,110 --> 01:14:59,070
- It's my favorite!

1455
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:02,530
- It's yours and any other model you want.

1456
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:04,800
All the toys you can cram into your house.

1457
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,360
I'll get a mack truck and you can fill it.

1458
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,820
- That's very generous, Mr. Stuart,

1459
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:12,193
but I think Justin has
enough toys already.

1460
01:15:13,321 --> 01:15:15,640
- No, really, he's mistaken.

1461
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,070
- Come on.

1462
01:15:17,070 --> 01:15:19,363
You can never have enough toys.

1463
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:22,010
- Very well put, Stu.

1464
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:22,853
- Justin.

1465
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:25,380
I'm Sherry Rogers.

1466
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:26,900
- Stu Stuart, good to meet you.

1467
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:27,870
- Danny Rogers.

1468
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:28,760
- [Stu] Pleasure.

1469
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:29,730
- I'm Kate.

1470
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:30,930
- Very nice to meet you.

1471
01:15:31,841 --> 01:15:33,260
Well what do you say, Justin?

1472
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:36,730
- Well sir, I think my dad's right.

1473
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:39,670
I'm pretty well stocked
in the toy department.

1474
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:43,180
I know it sounds weird but I'd
really like something else.

1475
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:44,487
- What's that?

1476
01:15:44,487 --> 01:15:47,410
- I'd like our families to
have Thanksgiving together.

1477
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:48,410
- Oh honey.

1478
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:50,510
Thanksgiving was yesterday.

1479
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:53,380
- Well who says you can only
be thankful one day a year.

1480
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:55,280
- Yeah, I think it would be real cool

1481
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,570
if we could all spend some time together.

1482
01:15:57,570 --> 01:15:59,530
- I'd love that, Justin, I really would

1483
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:02,020
but unfortunately I'm short on time.

1484
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,533
Anything else, you name it.

1485
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:07,900
- I can't think of anything else.

1486
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,283
- Dad, please?

1487
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:13,100
- [Stu] You have the extra space?

1488
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:14,000
- We'll make room.

1489
01:16:17,091 --> 01:16:19,558
- I'll get your mother
on the first plane out.

1490
01:16:19,558 --> 01:16:21,808
(mumbling)

1491
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:25,360
It's me.

1492
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,340
Cancel all my meetings,
I won't be in til Monday.

1493
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:30,970
No buts, cancel them.

1494
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,420
Come on, kids ride with me in the limo.

1495
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:36,307
We'll follow you.

1496
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:40,010
- Your dad seems really cool.

1497
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:41,060
- He's getting there.

1498
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:44,600
- Chelsea, I've decided something.

1499
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,370
I'm not gonna put myself up for adoption.

1500
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:48,820
- I think that's a good idea.

1501
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:52,380
Thanks for saving me.

1502
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,690
You're a way cool kid.

1503
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:55,440
- Hey, anytime.

1504
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:59,130
You're pretty okay too, for a girl.

1505
01:16:59,130 --> 01:17:01,380
(laughing)

1506
01:17:05,135 --> 01:17:08,052
(victorious music)

1507
01:17:16,854 --> 01:17:19,521
(comical music)
