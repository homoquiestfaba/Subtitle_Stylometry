I don't think so.

hurt me, Emmett.

what happened to

uh...I'm to blame
for vandalism now.

to seriously reconsider

testifying Monday
against Sanders.

259

It's hurting
your effectiveness
as a teacher.

you're persecuting Sanders

says is an accident.

discharge a gun

student's stomach,

just forget about it?

an accident.

of onesy-twosy murders
with a mass kill,

370
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:03,572
then move on to his next
teaching assignment.

371
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:23,636
Come on, Jenna,
don't be mad.

372
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,638
Baldwin ambushed me
when I went in there

373
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:27,161
to talk about
this weekend.

374
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:29,250
Did he threaten you
with detention

375
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:31,557
if you didn't
side up with him

376
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,732
and gang up on me?

377
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:35,038
You'll either support
my decision or not.

378
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:36,518
What's it going to be?

379
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:38,085
I said I would.

380
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:38,999
You said...

381
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:40,391
But you're not
acting like it.

382
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:43,699
It's hard enough
without having to
fight you, too.

383
00:24:43,743 --> 00:24:45,309
I know that!

384
00:24:45,353 --> 00:24:49,313
Someone just
reminded me that this
is the right thing to do,

385
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:52,447
so I want to know,
one way or another,

386
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,580
where you stand.

387
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,761
You're right.

388
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:03,850
I should've told him
to go shove it.

389
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:07,506
Wouldn't have been
the first time.

390
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:11,074
He probably
would have tried

391
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:14,556
to give you
permanent detention,

392
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,603
like when
we were in school.

393
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:24,044
I don't know why
you like me, Jenna.

394
00:25:24,827 --> 00:25:26,046
You're a teacher.

395
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:27,613
I barely graduated.

396
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:29,484
You read
the classics.

397
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:34,489
I'm strictly
simpsonsreruns.

398
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:38,406
But I couldn't care
about anybody more.

399
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:41,496
You know that,
don't you?

400
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:51,680
I like you because
you have a good heart...

401
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:57,599
And because you're
not afraid to admit
when you're wrong.

402
00:25:57,643 --> 00:26:00,646
That's a very sexy quality.

403
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,531
Plus you got
the nicest buns

404
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,882
this side of Sacramento,
cowboy.

405
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:24,670
[Beep]

406
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:26,106
This is consistent
with its original

407
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:27,237
battle programming,

408
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:29,370
which was to infiltrate
the enemy camp,

409
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:31,154
test the security response,

410
00:26:31,198 --> 00:26:32,547
and then eliminate

411
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,551
as many of the enemy
as possible.

412
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:39,728
This is a very
unstable unit.

413
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:41,730
Stopping it might be
extremely dangerous,

414
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:43,166
especially if
it's locked into

415
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,821
some endless loop
kill-command sequence,

416
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:48,737
which I believe
is the case.

417
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:52,349
G.d. Ash out.

418
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,668
Yo!

419
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:08,888
Ooh, foxy mama!

420
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:10,585
Hoo-hoo!

421
00:28:44,853 --> 00:28:46,986
Sanders and I
thought you and I

422
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:49,510
should get to know
each other better.

423
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:50,511
Oh!

424
00:28:50,554 --> 00:28:51,991
Aah!

425
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:53,470
Aah!

426
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:11,227
Aah!

427
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:12,838
Oh!

428
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:22,151
I'd like to help--
ha ha!

429
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:25,024
But these gangster boys
won't let me.

430
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:26,721
Help!

431
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,766
Help!

432
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:31,247
Miss Jenna's in danger
from a maniac!

433
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:32,379
Help!

434
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:35,904
Let me go, you bad,
bad gangbanger boys!

435
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:39,473
Oh, no.
He's gonna hurt her.

436
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:41,431
Uh!

437
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:43,869
Help!

438
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:45,261
Help.

439
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:53,052
You haven't seen nothin'
last week, miss mckensie.

440
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:54,880
That was a mistake.

441
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:58,535
It was an accident,
right?

442
00:29:58,579 --> 00:29:59,885
Right?

443
00:29:59,928 --> 00:30:03,627
You haven't seen nothin'
last week, mckensie.

444
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:11,505
You need to take me
a little more serious
when I tell you something,

445
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:13,899
miss mckensie.

446
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:16,249
Aah!

447
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:20,166
See, I won't let you
put me into jail.

448
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:22,559
Remember that.

449
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:31,568

450
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:36,835

No!

453
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:42,188
No! Aah!

454
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:43,842
Aah!

455
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:06,603
I just don't
have the manpower

456
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,562
to assign someone
to you permanently.

457
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:11,086
I know. I'll...
I'll be fine.

458
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,349
Just don't get
yourself hurt.

459
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:14,698
These boys
are mean.

460
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:15,874
Instead of excuses,

461
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,614
why aren't you doing
something to help her?

462
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:19,442
You don't
know anything
about this.

463
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:21,401
There are
extenuating
circumstances.

464
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:23,577
The only circumstance
you should be concerned with

465
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,493
is the fact that she's
doing her civic duty

466
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:29,409
and you're doing nothing
to support or help her.

467
00:31:29,452 --> 00:31:32,934
Now you wait
just one minute!

468
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:42,944
Could you, um,
take me home, please?

469
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:46,992
You will be
going to school
this morning?

470
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:52,040
I--i don't think so.

471
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:55,174
You have to go.

472
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:58,481
Otherwise,
the others will know
that Sanders has won.

473
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:02,094
You'll never get respect
from any of them again.

474
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:04,139
Look, don't...

475
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:05,271
Don't patronize me.

476
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:07,273
I'm not one
of your students.

477
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:11,842
Aren't you a little young
to be a teacher anyway?

478
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:13,540
Aren't you?

479
00:32:26,857 --> 00:32:28,990
That's an
interesting-looking book.

480
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:30,644
Do you mind?

481
00:32:35,257 --> 00:32:36,476
Poems of war.

482
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,565
A--a little light reading?

483
00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:40,523
It's a good book.

484
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:44,179
I didn't mean
to make light of it.

485
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:48,009
Can I borrow it?

486
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:52,579
I promise
I'll give it back.

487
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:57,714
Yeah.

488
00:32:58,063 --> 00:33:00,021
The poems
help center me.

489
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:03,242

the mission.

00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:59,434
Oh, god damn it,
Jenna!

551
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:00,479
What? What?

552
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:03,133
What are you
so mad about?

553
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:05,701
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

554
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:07,703
What would you
have done?

555
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:09,749
I feel like
this complete idiot.

556
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,011
Everybody knows
except me.

557
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:13,274
What bothers you more,
Emmett,

558
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:16,277
that I was attacked
or that you weren't told?

559
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,801
I swear to god,
I don't know
anything anymore.

560
00:37:18,845 --> 00:37:21,500
What were you
doing out here
by yourself?

561
00:37:21,543 --> 00:37:23,241
Gee, that's a tough one.

562
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:26,461
I guess it's that
I don't get nearly enough
excitement in my life.

563
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:27,593
Oh, I get it.

564
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:29,377
We're doing
the sarcastic
thing, huh?

565
00:37:29,421 --> 00:37:32,206
Yeah. Yeah.
It's all my fault.

566
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,947
I should have
told Sanders

567
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,949
not to kill that student
in cold blood

568
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:38,430
so you wouldn't have
to be so put out!

569
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:41,650
Maybe you should
reconsider testifying.

570
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:45,437
I mean, no one
but you is saying...

571
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,352
Go ahead, say it.

572
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:51,007
Go ahead, Emmett.

573
00:37:52,226 --> 00:37:53,575
Say it!

574
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,580
Just take me home.

575
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:04,238
I got to stop
at the trailer

576
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,372
and pick up
my overnight stuff.

577
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:09,417
I, um...

578
00:38:09,852 --> 00:38:14,204
I don't think
I want you to stay
tonight, o.K.?

579
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:20,863
Why don't you
just drop me off at
the sheriff's office

580
00:38:20,907 --> 00:38:23,083
so I can file a report?

581
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:24,780
Hey, fine.

582
00:38:24,824 --> 00:38:25,999
Whatever you want.

583
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:29,263
Let's do this
your way, Jenna.

584
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:34,921
Ha ha!

585
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:37,315
Oh, Jenna!

586
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:49,849
Ice...

587
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:50,676
Hello.

588
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,895
Heh heh heh
heh heh heh!

589
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:55,594
Do you like
tormenting people?

590
00:38:55,637 --> 00:38:56,464
Suck it.

591
00:38:56,508 --> 00:38:59,249
Suck it in,
you punk.

592
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,077
Yeah...

593
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:03,210
Heh heh heh!

594
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:05,473
It's no fun
to be afraid,

595
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:06,648
to be tormented,

596
00:39:06,692 --> 00:39:08,607
is it?

597
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,784
Oh...no.

598
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:12,524
Go ahead.

599
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:14,700
Now's your chance,
ice.

600
00:39:14,743 --> 00:39:16,484
Run.

601
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,488
Ice...

602
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:27,713
Ice...

603
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:30,629
Run.

604
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:31,412
Run.

605
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:34,241
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

606
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:37,113
Ice.

607
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:56,350
Come on!

608
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:15,151
[Gas hisses]

609
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:18,720
You've been more than a bit
of a discipline problem.

610
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:23,421
Now we're going to
have to do something
about your attitude.

611
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:25,988
Aah! Uhh!

612
00:40:26,032 --> 00:40:27,468
Come on, man!

613
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:28,730
Uhh! Aah!

614
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:31,559
Aah! Let me go!

615
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:35,998
In fact, you're on
permanent detention.

616
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,697
[Hiss]

617
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,482
No...no...aah...

618
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:42,527
No! No!

619
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,963
Aah!

620
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:48,097
Aah! Aah!

621
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,589
School's out.

622
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,167
Please?

623
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:18,432
I really need some time
by myself right now.

624
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:22,044
Damn it, Emmett,
just leave it alone.

625
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:25,570
I can't be with you
right now.

626
00:41:34,753 --> 00:41:37,103
I'll be right back.

627
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,687
What is this about?

628
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:58,167
Shouldn't you have told
Baldwin about this?

629
00:41:58,211 --> 00:42:02,389
Nah. We get those
all the time through
the state net.

630
00:42:02,432 --> 00:42:03,738
I usually trash 'em.

631
00:42:03,782 --> 00:42:06,915
As if anything
as interesting as
a serial killer

632
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:09,135
would ever happen
in this town.

633
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:10,832
Well, you know
what I mean.

634
00:42:10,876 --> 00:42:12,660
No, uh,
I'm afraid I don't.

635
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:15,445
I don't think "interesting"
is the word I'd use

636
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:17,796
to describe
a serial murderer.

637
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,101
Who asked you?

638
00:42:19,145 --> 00:42:20,102
Don't touch
my garbage.

639
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:22,540
This is
official trash.

640
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:25,847
Not for
civilian eyes.

641
00:43:37,484 --> 00:43:41,793
"I will strike a path
in death's shoes

642
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:44,317
"until the mission
I conclude.

643
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,754
"Until the mission
I conclude.

644
00:43:46,798 --> 00:43:50,105
"No sorrows or regret.

645
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:53,979
"Death is my mission.

646
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:55,284
"My mission...

647
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:57,243
Is met."

648
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:06,034
"The enemy is before me,

649
00:44:06,078 --> 00:44:08,863
"around me and yet...

650
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:11,474
No fear will I have."

651
00:44:13,738 --> 00:44:15,914
Pass it up, man.

652
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:20,919
Whoo! Hey!

653
00:44:22,224 --> 00:44:24,052
What's up, man?

654
00:44:24,096 --> 00:44:26,794
Hey, what's happening?

655
00:45:23,677 --> 00:45:28,421
All right,
you little shit,
no more fucking around.

656
00:45:28,464 --> 00:45:29,770
You listen to me.

657
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:34,079
You come near Jenna,
you're going to wind up dead.

658
00:45:34,122 --> 00:45:35,123
Got it?

659
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:36,951
Good.

660
00:46:01,628 --> 00:46:03,848
Hey, Emmett,
you ready to go?

661
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:07,416
Hey-o, Tom,
I'll be right with you.

662
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:17,426
[Bang]

663
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,342
Tom, Tom,
don't use the gun.

664
00:46:20,386 --> 00:46:22,823
It's got
the gasoline balls

665
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:24,607
I made up
as an experiment.

666
00:46:24,651 --> 00:46:27,088
I just wanted
to clear them out

667
00:46:27,132 --> 00:46:29,743
before the kids
got here.

668
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:43,104
Let's go to the bunker.

669
00:46:43,452 --> 00:46:46,847
Emmett,
will you slow down?
You're killing me.

670
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:49,241
This stuff's heavy.

671
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:58,511
Thank you.

672
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,915
How far are we
from the trailers,
about half a mile?

673
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:12,003
Yeah.

674
00:47:12,046 --> 00:47:13,134
I don't know.

675
00:47:13,178 --> 00:47:16,616
It seems close.
The kids might
find it.

676
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:19,097
No, they won't.

677
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:24,102
[Tapping]

678
00:47:24,145 --> 00:47:26,974
A concrete bunker
and a wooden door?

679
00:47:27,018 --> 00:47:31,196
I got a metal one
coming from Sacramento.

680
00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:50,519
So, Emmett,
what'd you do last night?
Watch TV, huh?

681
00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:58,049
All right,
I gave Sanders
a little hell.

682
00:47:58,092 --> 00:48:00,094
Do your goddamn
job right...

683
00:48:00,138 --> 00:48:02,575
What do you want me
to do?

684
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:03,968
Can't arrest Sanders
for anything.

685
00:48:04,011 --> 00:48:06,405
He hasn't done anything,
really.

686
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:08,102
A lot of stuff.

687
00:48:08,146 --> 00:48:11,497
Yeah. Buying military stuff
for the museum sure does
accumulate.

688
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,803
How many of these
armor suits you got?

689
00:48:13,847 --> 00:48:17,938
I could use one.
I wouldn't mind
being bulletproof.

690
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:19,113
Extra small. Surplus.

691
00:48:19,157 --> 00:48:21,811
Barely fit the mannequin
at the museum.

692
00:48:21,855 --> 00:48:23,988
Wouldn't even fit you close.

693
00:48:24,031 --> 00:48:26,207
Hey, what's this?

694
00:48:27,165 --> 00:48:28,253
Tom, don't touch that.

695
00:48:28,296 --> 00:48:30,255
This is
a suicide detonator.

696
00:48:30,298 --> 00:48:32,213
Once it's armed,
it's armed.

697
00:48:32,257 --> 00:48:34,999
You mean you can't
turn it off?

698
00:48:35,042 --> 00:48:36,174
That's right.

699
00:48:36,217 --> 00:48:37,044
Oops.

700
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:38,393
Right, oops.

701
00:48:38,437 --> 00:48:41,005
All right,
how's it look?
Everything look secure?

702
00:48:41,048 --> 00:48:42,049
Yeah.

703
00:48:42,093 --> 00:48:44,051
O.k., let's go.

704
00:48:45,052 --> 00:48:47,098
Come on, let's go!

705
00:49:00,111 --> 00:49:01,721
Hi. How are you today?

706
00:49:01,764 --> 00:49:07,118
I wanted to tell you
I'm really enjoying
that book you gave me.

707
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:08,510
You seem surprised.

708
00:49:08,554 --> 00:49:10,991
To tell you
the truth, I am.

709
00:49:11,035 --> 00:49:13,820
I wanted to ask you
about something.

710
00:49:13,863 --> 00:49:14,995
It's about
the dedication.

711
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:19,043
I bought it
at a used book store.

712
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:27,138
Hey, wait up!

713
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:32,665
Do you know
ray Buchanan
from another school?

714
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:34,058
No.

715
00:50:23,498 --> 00:50:26,110
Let's go get Emmett.

716
00:50:26,153 --> 00:50:31,332
Mike, get on the horn.
Get forensics down here
right away.

717
00:50:34,248 --> 00:50:38,252
Let me have
that license plate scanner.

718
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:18,858
Damn, Emmett,
you should have stuck
to shooting at fires.

719
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:45,102
I didn't hear you come in.

720
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:48,975
I was really...
Lost in space.

721
00:51:49,018 --> 00:51:50,411
I just heard
they arrested Emmett

722
00:51:50,455 --> 00:51:54,589
for the murder of the boy
who attacked me last night.

723
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,288
To tell the truth,

724
00:51:57,331 --> 00:52:02,597
the thing that has me
most worried is...

725
00:52:02,641 --> 00:52:08,473
That I think Emmett
is totally capable
of killing that boy.

726
00:52:09,474 --> 00:52:12,955
It's a pretty scary thought.

727
00:52:16,394 --> 00:52:18,961
I don't know what to do.

728
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:21,790
I'm not sure
I understand you.

729
00:52:21,834 --> 00:52:23,705
Never mind.

730
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:27,492
I have to go to the jail.

731
00:52:31,452 --> 00:52:34,629
Will you come with me?

732
00:52:40,461 --> 00:52:41,636
He didn't suffer any.

733
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,598
Doc said his neck broke,
didn't feel a thing.

734
00:52:47,468 --> 00:52:49,340
I want to see Emmett.

735
00:52:49,383 --> 00:52:50,645
No chance.

736
00:52:50,689 --> 00:52:51,864
Why not?

737
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:54,432
What do you suppose
he's in here for?

738
00:52:54,475 --> 00:52:56,651
Because of me?
It's my fault?

739
00:52:56,695 --> 00:53:01,047
If he killed that boy,
he didn't kill him
for anybody else.

740
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:02,701
You said
it was an accident.

741
00:53:02,744 --> 00:53:04,572
We're not talking
about him.

742
00:53:04,616 --> 00:53:07,619
Ray just fell
off his bike,
Mrs. Buchanan.

743
00:53:07,662 --> 00:53:10,187
Ray Buchanan is dead?

744
00:53:11,144 --> 00:53:12,406
[Knock knock]

745
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:15,714
The man you arrested
for the murder of the kid...

746
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:16,845
What about him?

747
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:19,239
How long
have you known him?

748
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:20,371
Who are you?

749
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:22,590
You should've got
a bulletin yesterday.

750
00:53:22,634 --> 00:53:24,636
Suddenly you got
a lot of dead kids.

751
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:27,204
Only one of them's
a homicide.

752
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:29,989
Is the man you arrested
a teacher?

753
00:53:30,032 --> 00:53:32,165
No.
What are you so
interest--

754
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,559
hey, wait
just one minute.

755
00:53:34,602 --> 00:53:36,082
Hey, pal!

756
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:38,389
Ash!

757
00:53:38,737 --> 00:53:41,130
G.d. Ash.

758
00:53:41,653 --> 00:53:42,610
Hey!

759
00:53:42,654 --> 00:53:44,699
What's going on?

760
00:53:47,049 --> 00:53:48,747
Had to be sure.

761
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,966
What are you
talking about?

762
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,578
That's classified,
sheriff, but, uh,

763
00:53:53,621 --> 00:53:57,234
thank you for
your cooperation.

764
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,763
I'm not going to forget
about this, Tom.

765
00:54:05,024 --> 00:54:06,721
I know you're pissed,
Emmett,

766
00:54:06,765 --> 00:54:10,682
but I just couldn't
take a chance on this.

767
00:54:10,725 --> 00:54:12,074
I'm really sorry.

768
00:54:12,118 --> 00:54:13,641
By the way,
Jenna's here.

769
00:54:13,685 --> 00:54:19,125
I'll send her back
if you can keep civil
for five minutes.

770
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,729
Ahem. Emmett.

771
00:54:58,686 --> 00:55:00,819
I'm letting you out.

772
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,648
Jeff Patterson
down at the Daisy Mae

773
00:55:03,691 --> 00:55:06,128
verified you were there
all night.

774
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:08,783
I said he would.

775
00:55:09,436 --> 00:55:10,785
Oh, it's getting late.

776
00:55:10,829 --> 00:55:13,962
Hold up.
I'll give you a ride.

777
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:17,488
Come on, Emmett.

778
00:55:17,531 --> 00:55:19,794
Emmett! Wait!

779
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:22,362
[Telephone rings]

780
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:23,320
[Ring]

781
00:55:23,363 --> 00:55:26,105
Sheriff's office.
Yost speaking.

782
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,716
Yeah. Hi, honey.

783
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:30,239
They're doing what?

784
00:55:30,283 --> 00:55:34,809
Well, stop peeping
out the window at them.

785
00:55:38,944 --> 00:55:42,687
I got to go.
I got to catch up
with Emmett.

786
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,036
I didn't say that.

787
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,822
I didn't say that Emmett's
more important than you.

788
00:55:54,612 --> 00:55:56,265
Whoo whoo whoo whoo!

789
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:57,049
Yeah!

790
00:55:57,092 --> 00:55:58,790
Hey, pretty boy!

791
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:01,532
What's up, punk?

792
00:56:03,011 --> 00:56:06,667
Party at miss mckensie's!

793
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:07,755
Jenna!

794
00:56:07,799 --> 00:56:10,279
Jenna!

795
00:56:21,813 --> 00:56:24,816
Where'd you
disappear to?

796
00:56:25,817 --> 00:56:28,776
Never mind.
I'm glad you're here.

797
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,735
I came to get my book.

798
00:56:30,778 --> 00:56:33,955
I almost hate
to give it up.

799
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:38,917
Things have been
so...Strange
and confused lately--

800
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,312
Emmett being
accused of being
a serial killer.

801
00:56:43,356 --> 00:56:49,101
I mean,
they might as well
have accused you or me.

802
00:56:50,885 --> 00:56:52,757
After all,
we're both teachers.

803
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,803
We both knew
the students who died.

804
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:59,677
You even knew ray from
another school, right?

805
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,897
I told you before
I didn't know him.

806
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:05,378
May I please
have my book?

807
00:57:07,902 --> 00:57:10,905
These poems
are inspirational.

808
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:14,387
Thank you
for letting me read it.

809
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,912
I feel better
about what i'm
going to do now.

810
00:57:17,956 --> 00:57:19,697
Maybe you understand
the book

811
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:23,483
because you're committed
to doing the right thing--

812
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:24,353
to duty.

813
00:57:24,397 --> 00:57:25,833
I don't know.

814
00:57:25,877 --> 00:57:30,795
I'm not even sure
that I want to be
a teacher anymore,

815
00:57:30,838 --> 00:57:32,884
but, uh...

816
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,973
I don't know.

817
00:57:39,934 --> 00:57:43,242
Let's not talk
about it, o.K.?

818
00:57:49,944 --> 00:57:53,339
Doing your duty
is never easy.

819
00:57:53,382 --> 00:57:57,474
Nobody understands that
more than I do.

820
00:58:27,025 --> 00:58:29,201
Last and final warning--

821
00:58:29,244 --> 00:58:31,508
don't testify, bitch.

822
00:58:41,213 --> 00:58:43,302
Fuck me.

823
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:49,047
Jenna!

824
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:51,571
Sheriff, this is Hazel.

825
00:58:51,615 --> 00:58:54,400
There's been a report
of shots fired

826
00:58:54,443 --> 00:58:55,532
at Jenna's house.

827
00:58:55,575 --> 00:58:58,926
You better get over there
right away.

828
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:03,931
Jenna!

829
00:59:03,975 --> 00:59:06,194
John!

830
00:59:06,238 --> 00:59:08,457
[Siren]

831
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:14,942
Jenna?

832
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,090
Emmett. Jenna.

833
00:59:33,047 --> 00:59:36,485
You all right?
Was it Sanders?

834
00:59:36,529 --> 00:59:37,574
Was it Sanders?

835
00:59:37,617 --> 00:59:40,228
Leave her alone
for a goddamn minute.

836
00:59:40,272 --> 00:59:42,230
I don't know
who it was.

837
00:59:42,274 --> 00:59:43,492
I never
saw him before.

838
00:59:43,536 --> 00:59:45,669
This mean
you're not going
to press charges?

839
00:59:45,712 --> 00:59:48,062
I don't want
to press charges.

840
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:50,238
I don't want
to testify
about anything,

841
00:59:50,282 --> 00:59:53,415
and I don't
want to answer
anybody's questions

842
00:59:53,459 --> 00:59:54,678
about anything.

843
00:59:54,721 --> 00:59:58,246
I am out
of the civic duty
business for good.

844
01:00:36,241 --> 01:00:38,069
Fuck it!

845
01:00:38,547 --> 01:00:42,726
We hit her tomorrow
at this RotC thing.

846
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:47,992
I want everybody
here tonight.

847
01:00:48,035 --> 01:00:51,822
I know exactly
what we got to do...

848
01:00:52,344 --> 01:00:55,652
And how we got to do it.

849
01:01:05,139 --> 01:01:06,227
Ow.

850
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:07,054
You o.K.?

851
01:01:07,098 --> 01:01:08,708
Yeah.

852
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:10,623
Sorry.

853
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,320
It's o.K.

854
01:01:50,141 --> 01:01:53,013
[Moaning]

855
01:02:11,902 --> 01:02:14,600
[Moaning echoes]

856
01:02:32,966 --> 01:02:36,361
[Heavy breathing echoing]

857
01:04:29,822 --> 01:04:32,390
Damn it, Sanders!

858
01:04:36,437 --> 01:04:38,700
I'm sorry.

859
01:04:39,136 --> 01:04:40,789
This is
all my fault.

860
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:44,968
This is no one's fault
except Sanders'.

861
01:05:02,376 --> 01:05:04,422
The kids are
starting to arrive.

862
01:05:04,465 --> 01:05:05,814
Where are the cops?

863
01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:07,729
Do they get
special training

864
01:05:07,773 --> 01:05:10,819
to never be
where you need them?

865
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:14,345
[Jenna]
Relax. They'll get here.

866
01:05:14,388 --> 01:05:17,348
This guy Bolen shows up,
kids start dying,

867
01:05:17,391 --> 01:05:20,003
and after
a drive-by shooting,
he just disappears.

868
01:05:20,046 --> 01:05:24,050
Maybe he was even
in on it with Sanders.
Ever think of that?

869
01:05:24,094 --> 01:05:29,142
Why would he push me
inside the house
if he wanted me dead?

870
01:05:29,186 --> 01:05:31,318
I don't know.

871
01:05:34,321 --> 01:05:35,322
He just disappeared.

872
01:05:35,366 --> 01:05:38,717
Looks kind of funny,
that's all.

873
01:06:12,577 --> 01:06:13,447
All right.

874
01:06:13,491 --> 01:06:14,796
It's all over.

875
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,884
Let's take them.

876
01:06:15,928 --> 01:06:19,410
We got to go over
the plan of attack.

877
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:20,933
All right! Enough!
That's it!

878
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,980
We've shot at all the tin pans
we're going to today.

879
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:28,462
Who's in the mood
for some good, clean fun?

880
01:06:28,506 --> 01:06:30,421
Aw, forget you.
No way.

881
01:06:30,464 --> 01:06:34,555
How about we get
down and dirty instead?

882
01:06:37,819 --> 01:06:39,386
Your ass is mine!

883
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:41,432
This is war!

884
01:06:41,475 --> 01:06:43,260
O.k. O.K.

885
01:06:43,303 --> 01:06:45,566
This has to look
like an accident,

886
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:47,960
or I'm the first one
they'll look for.

887
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,398
She's pink,
so you green guys
attack her group

888
01:06:51,442 --> 01:06:52,660
with the paint guns.

889
01:06:52,704 --> 01:06:56,055
You pink guys hang back
and don't get involved

890
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:57,361
until Juan comes in

891
01:06:57,404 --> 01:06:59,885
and tells her that one
of the players is injured.

892
01:06:59,928 --> 01:07:04,803
Then you pink guys
make sure she ends up
back here,

893
01:07:04,846 --> 01:07:07,545
where we can do her
quietly.

894
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:09,068
All right!
All right!

895
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:11,244
This is a referee.

896
01:07:11,288 --> 01:07:13,464
Anyone wearing orange
is a referee.

897
01:07:13,507 --> 01:07:16,380
You shoot him,
you're automatically
disqualified.

898
01:07:16,423 --> 01:07:17,424
Understand?

899
01:07:17,468 --> 01:07:18,556
Yes, sir!

900
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:20,949
When the siren sounds,
the game is over.

901
01:07:20,993 --> 01:07:23,735
Don't make US
come looking for you.

902
01:07:23,778 --> 01:07:24,736
All right?

903
01:07:24,779 --> 01:07:25,867
All right!

904
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:26,999
Use your brains.

905
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:31,438
If someone tumbles
to what's going on...

906
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:33,875
Cut their throat.

907
01:07:33,919 --> 01:07:36,400
No guns.

908
01:07:38,445 --> 01:07:41,448
We're the ones with armbands
below the elbow.

909
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:43,189
Once we have these masks on,

910
01:07:43,233 --> 01:07:45,844

to tell who's who.

Go! Go!

913
01:07:51,893 --> 01:07:53,852
And the pink team...

914
01:07:56,246 --> 01:07:58,683
Watch your asses.

915
01:08:01,903 --> 01:08:03,949
Let's do this.

916
01:08:11,696 --> 01:08:13,132
Pretty good, coach.

917
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:17,093
Maybe you ought to
teach the cheerleaders
instead of me.

918
01:08:17,136 --> 01:08:18,398
I don't think so.

919
01:08:18,442 --> 01:08:21,749
My pompons would freeze
in those short dresses.

920
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:25,231

922
01:08:28,016 --> 01:08:29,583
This is the sheriff.
Back.

923
01:08:29,627 --> 01:08:30,758
Emmett called again.

924
01:08:30,802 --> 01:08:33,152
That plate
you had me run--

925
01:08:33,196 --> 01:08:34,066

926
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,633
Forget about it.
He's history.

as stolen.

928
01:08:37,243 --> 01:08:40,203
That federal man
was thrown out on his butt

929
01:08:40,246 --> 01:08:41,682
for a violent
insubordination

930

I lost track
of the battle droid
last night,

to the boardinghouse,

934
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:53,607
but the principal
of the school says

935
01:08:53,651 --> 01:08:57,307
it's supposed
to chaperon a group
of kids this morning.

936
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,657
Based on its behavior
and previous m.O.,

937
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:03,530
this is
a perfect opportunity
for a mass kill.

938
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:07,665

'Cause it's loaded
with armor-piercing

it'll be with this gun.

01:18:53,163 --> 01:18:55,295
Aah!

1093
01:18:55,339 --> 01:18:56,862
Aah!

1094
01:18:58,472 --> 01:19:02,346
Aah!

1095
01:19:05,305 --> 01:19:07,090
Stay here.

1096
01:19:07,873 --> 01:19:11,094
All right, you--
or what's left of you--

1097
01:19:11,137 --> 01:19:13,705
you're under arrest.

1098
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:17,970
Aah!

1099
01:19:19,537 --> 01:19:20,799
Aah! Aah!

1100
01:19:20,843 --> 01:19:23,367
[Bones breaking]

1101
01:19:36,859 --> 01:19:38,599
Aah!

1102
01:19:54,093 --> 01:19:56,052
Jenna?

1103
01:20:05,278 --> 01:20:06,845
Miss mckensie.

1104
01:20:06,889 --> 01:20:09,500
How you doing?

1105
01:20:11,415 --> 01:20:12,982
Well, go ahead.

1106
01:20:13,025 --> 01:20:14,505
Pull the trigger.

1107
01:20:14,548 --> 01:20:17,464
That'll solve
your problem.

1108
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,169
Ha ha ha.

1109
01:20:26,212 --> 01:20:30,129
Ha ha ha ha!

1110
01:20:30,173 --> 01:20:33,045
You go to hell,
Sanders.

1111
01:20:33,089 --> 01:20:35,831
You first.

1112
01:20:35,874 --> 01:20:38,137
[Gunshot]

1113
01:20:41,401 --> 01:20:44,056
You first.

1114
01:20:51,542 --> 01:20:53,326
Oh.

1115
01:20:57,243 --> 01:21:01,857
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

1116
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:12,476
No!

1117
01:21:12,519 --> 01:21:14,086
Aah!

1118
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:24,967
Aah!

1119
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:25,750
Aah!

1120
01:21:25,793 --> 01:21:28,405
I am an a-77 battle droid.

1121
01:21:28,448 --> 01:21:31,538
My primary objective
is to infiltrate
and kill the enemy.

1122
01:21:31,582 --> 01:21:33,453
Why can't
I eliminate you, huh?

1123
01:21:33,497 --> 01:21:37,414
'Cause you're not
a battle droid,
you sick shit.

1124
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,421
Ha ha ha ha.

1125
01:21:44,464 --> 01:21:47,163
Ha ha ha.

1126
01:21:47,206 --> 01:21:48,512
"To my son John,

1127
01:21:48,555 --> 01:21:53,430
"on the Eve
of his enlistment
into the service.

1128
01:21:53,473 --> 01:21:56,433
Duty and discipline."

1129
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,306
No prisoners.

1130
01:22:01,481 --> 01:22:04,441
It's from your father,

1131
01:22:04,484 --> 01:22:06,269
professor...

1132
01:22:06,312 --> 01:22:08,662
Professor forrest!

1133
01:22:08,967 --> 01:22:12,362
You're his kid
that went mental.

1134
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,454
I am a battle droid.

1135
01:22:17,497 --> 01:22:19,847
Get a fucking clue.

1136
01:22:19,891 --> 01:22:23,329
Battle droids are kind
of scratchproof, Johnny.

1137
01:22:23,373 --> 01:22:25,244
Human beings are soft.

1138
01:22:25,288 --> 01:22:26,767
They can't take
their punishment.

1139
01:22:26,811 --> 01:22:28,944
They don't make
good soldiers.

1140
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:31,381
You're right.

1141
01:22:32,121 --> 01:22:35,951
They bleed too much.
Ha ha ha ha.

1142
01:22:38,127 --> 01:22:40,390
You're not a droid, John.

1143
01:22:40,433 --> 01:22:44,263
You're just a kid
wearing k-33 body armor.

1144
01:22:44,307 --> 01:22:45,699
Well...

1145
01:22:45,743 --> 01:22:49,529
End of mission, Johnny.

1146
01:22:55,318 --> 01:22:58,451
So you're wearing
kelvans too, huh?

1147
01:23:00,105 --> 01:23:02,586
Damn.

1148
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:04,675
Uhh!

1149
01:23:04,718 --> 01:23:07,591
G.d. Ash...

1150
01:23:07,634 --> 01:23:10,028
Out.

1151
01:23:10,072 --> 01:23:11,899
Aah!

1152
01:23:11,943 --> 01:23:14,119
Aah!

1153
01:23:38,839 --> 01:23:41,581
I have failed
my mission.

1154
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:42,930
I must die.

1155
01:23:42,974 --> 01:23:46,630
Would your father be proud
of that attitude, John?

1156
01:23:46,673 --> 01:23:49,546
We've both failed.

1157
01:23:49,589 --> 01:23:51,461
We'll die together.

1158
01:23:51,504 --> 01:23:53,506
No.

1159
01:23:55,073 --> 01:23:56,596
You're right.

1160
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:57,641
You're right.

1161
01:23:57,684 --> 01:23:59,077
You're right.

1162
01:23:59,121 --> 01:24:00,470
I have failed.

1163
01:24:00,513 --> 01:24:01,601
I failed.

1164
01:24:01,645 --> 01:24:06,302
But i--i can do better.
I know I can.

1165
01:24:06,345 --> 01:24:08,956
I can't give up.

1166
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,569
I won't give up.

1167
01:24:12,612 --> 01:24:17,487
We can't give up, John.

1168
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:18,792
We're soldiers.

1169
01:24:18,836 --> 01:24:21,099
It's our destiny,
John...

1170
01:24:21,143 --> 01:24:24,102
To face
insurmountable odds

1171
01:24:24,146 --> 01:24:26,104
and overcome them,
right?

1172
01:24:26,148 --> 01:24:27,888
Right?

1173
01:24:28,672 --> 01:24:32,763
It's our mission
in life.

1174
01:24:34,547 --> 01:24:38,116
The enemy
is before me,

1175
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:38,986
around me,

1176
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:41,511
and yet
no fear will I have.

1177
01:24:41,554 --> 01:24:43,730
My mission is met.

1178
01:24:44,818 --> 01:24:46,385
The night--

1179
01:24:46,429 --> 01:24:48,474
the night i--

1180
01:24:48,518 --> 01:24:51,608
the night will bring
so much death,

1181
01:24:51,651 --> 01:24:53,610
so many horrors born

1182
01:24:53,653 --> 01:24:56,395
on a river of blood...

1183
01:24:56,439 --> 01:24:57,396
Called duty

1184
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:01,096
by men who compassion
has scorned.

1185
01:25:06,057 --> 01:25:08,799
The life I have
wasn't mine to choose,

1186
01:25:08,842 --> 01:25:11,976
but death will always be
the shoes I walk in.

1187
01:25:12,019 --> 01:25:15,371
I will stride the path
in death's shoes

1188
01:25:15,414 --> 01:25:19,244
until the mission
I conclude.

1189
01:25:20,593 --> 01:25:22,987
Death is my mission.

1190
01:25:24,075 --> 01:25:25,424
My mission is met.

1191
01:25:25,468 --> 01:25:27,905
Fuck your mission!

1192
01:25:30,777 --> 01:25:32,388
Ohh.

1193
01:25:38,611 --> 01:25:39,917
Aah!

1194
01:25:42,441 --> 01:25:44,661
Aah!

1195
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:09,816
Aah!

1196
01:26:15,648 --> 01:26:17,911
I love you.

1197
01:26:29,662 --> 01:26:32,099
What'd they think
they'd find of him,

1198
01:26:32,143 --> 01:26:33,710
little pieces
all over the bunker?

1199
01:26:33,753 --> 01:26:36,800
I know it didn't,
but he was inside
that bunker.

1200
01:26:36,843 --> 01:26:40,195
It was thousands
of degrees in there.
He burnt up.

1201
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:43,241
Instead of worrying about it,
you should be glad

1202
01:26:43,285 --> 01:26:47,158
that most of that ordnance
was too old to explode,

1203
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,682
or you'd be
in big trouble with--

1204
01:26:49,726 --> 01:26:52,685
I don't know if we'll
see each other tonight.

1205
01:26:52,729 --> 01:26:54,687
Tomorrow will be
a long day

1206
01:26:54,731 --> 01:26:56,689
with this remedial class
I'm teaching.

1207
01:26:56,733 --> 01:26:59,388
And then
my karate lessons.

1208
01:27:04,044 --> 01:27:05,394
Oh, don't be silly.

1209
01:27:05,437 --> 01:27:09,441
I'll be fine
with this new class.

1210
01:27:09,485 --> 01:27:11,269
They're just school kids.

1211
01:27:11,313 --> 01:27:14,664
A little worse
than most,

1212
01:27:14,707 --> 01:27:16,753
but kids, really.

1213
01:27:16,796 --> 01:27:18,494
After what
I've just been through,

1214
01:27:18,537 --> 01:27:21,801
nothing could
faze me anymore.

1215
01:27:21,845 --> 01:27:24,848
I'm on a mission...

1216
01:27:24,891 --> 01:27:27,285
So to speak.
