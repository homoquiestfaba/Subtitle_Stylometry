1
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:36,235
(Lou, Russian accent)
Doctor Breuer.

2
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:39,975
I must see
you on a matter

3
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:42,522
of life or death.

4
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:44,524
Meet me at nine
tomorrow morning

5
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:45,779
at the Cafe Rousse.

6
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,629
[violin music]

7
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:50,758
(Breuer)
A matter of life

8
00:00:50,858 --> 00:00:52,858
or death! Hmpf!

9
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:07,263
[exchange of greetings]

10
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:20,336
Doctor Breuer?

11
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,751
Lou Salome.

12
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,085
How do you do?

13
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:29,836
May I?

14
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:31,123
Would you like
a coffee?

15
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:33,092
Yes, café latte.

16
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:35,402
Waiter, café
latte, please,

17
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:41,356
My friend
is preparing

18
00:01:41,456 --> 00:01:42,301
to kill himself,

19
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:43,851
This man's
death would have

20
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,170
momentous consequences

21
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,640
for me, for you,
for all of the world.

22
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,476
Who is
this friend?

23
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,111
The philosopher
Friedrich Nietzsche.

24
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:53,977
Nietzsche?
Should I

25
00:01:54,077 --> 00:01:55,214
know of him?

26
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:57,643
Not yet, but in time
we shall all

27
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:58,585
know of him.

28
00:01:58,685 --> 00:01:59,727
(Nietzsche)
How do

29
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:00,420
we confirm

30
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,205
a truth that has arrived
through disbelief

31
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:04,189
and skepticism

32
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:06,507
and not through some
childlike wishing

33
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:07,660
something were so.

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,689
It is hard to be
in God's hands.

35
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:10,697
It's not truth.

36
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,080
It is a child's wish
for the everlasting

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,266
blow to the nipple.

38
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:16,168
We have
evolutionary theory,

39
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:19,995
Evolutionary theory
scientifically demonstrates

40
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:21,441
God's redundancy.

41
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,827
So Darwin himself
had not the courage

42
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:28,094
to follow
his evidence

43
00:02:28,194 --> 00:02:30,565
to its true
conclusion. So--

44
00:02:30,665 --> 00:02:32,251
where are we?

45
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,113
Surely you must
all realize we

46
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:35,287
have created God--

47
00:02:35,387 --> 00:02:37,156
and all
of us together

48
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:39,256
have killed him.

49
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,060
God--

50
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,695
is dead.

51
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:43,929
My friend is sick.

52
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:45,899
What is the nature
of his illness?

53
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,333
Headaches.
Tormenting headaches,

54
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:49,524
My dear lady,
I will see

55
00:02:49,624 --> 00:02:50,169
your friend.

56
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:51,638
I'm a physician.

57
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,939
I know you can cure
his physical condition,

58
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,675
That is not
why I am here.

59
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:59,328
Nietzsche suffers
from the deepest despair,

60
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:01,180
That is what
I ask you to heal.

61
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,498
I cannot
cure despair.

62
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:07,132
Ah, but you
can, doctor.

63
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:08,455
I have a spy.

64
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,006
My brother,
a medical student,

65
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:13,065
attended the class in
which you described

66
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:13,926
a new technique.

67
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:15,662
The talking cure.

68
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,666
Now I can arrange
to steer Nietzsche

69
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:18,498
to your office

70
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,389
but he must believe
you're treating only

71
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:21,100
his headaches.

72
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,570
Tell me, is yours
a Russian accent?

73
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,170
It is.

74
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,861
Well, perhaps
the people in Russia

75
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:27,906
believe in sorcerers

76
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:30,075
but sorry, fraulein,
I am Austrian.

77
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:32,555
I have no magic
to offer you.

78
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:35,699
(Lou)
May I walk you

79
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:36,549
back to your hotel?

80
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,831
I would enjoy
that but--

81
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:41,364
my wife will be watching
from the window.

82
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:42,287
I have a duty.

83
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:43,523
A duty?

84
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,429
It is my duty
to be free

85
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:46,125
of duty.

86
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:49,888
Doctor, save Nietzsche.

87
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,153
(Breuer)
I am sorry.

88
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,288
I had hoped
it was hepatitis,

89
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:18,223
(patient)
How long--

90
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:21,676
do I have?

91
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:23,721
It is best
you put your

92
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:25,781
affairs in order.

93
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:32,751
Please, doctor.

94
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:34,790
How long?

95
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,145
(woman)
Please.

96
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:38,245
Tell us.

97
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:41,470
Three to
six months.

98
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,896
(frau Becker)
Are you

99
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:48,821
alright, doctor?

100
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,956
Make sure the Pfeiffers
are never billed again.

101
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:52,391
Of course.

102
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:53,642
Cancel all
their outstanding

103
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:54,226
debts to me.

104
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:55,495
Of course.

105
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,963
A Fraulein Salome
has suddenly arrived.

106
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:00,847
A very grand
young woman.

107
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:02,301
Show her in.

108
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:04,105
But Frau Reinhardt
has been waiting

109
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:04,671
for hours.

110
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,771
Frau Becker!

111
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:20,052
Fraulein Salome!

112
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:22,666
Doctor Breuer.

113
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:24,507
I see you like
to do things

114
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,458
for yourself,

115
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,628
Doesn't that deprive
men the pleasure

116
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:28,561
of serving you?

117
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,597
We both know that
some of the services

118
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,270
men provide are
not necessarily

119
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,131
good for women.

120
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:34,399
The habits
of a lifetime

121
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:37,035
are not easily
extinguished, my dear.

122
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:38,954
Your future
husband will need

123
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:40,405
extensive retraining.

124
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:43,256
No husband
for me. Ever.

125
00:05:43,356 --> 00:05:45,077
I would not
do that to

126
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:47,177
a man.

127
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,381
If then or ever
you use this

128
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:06,365
new technique,

129
00:06:06,465 --> 00:06:08,996
do not attempt to use
this mesmerism method

130
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:09,968
with Nietzsche.

131
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:12,126
Our patient would
refuse to engage

132
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:13,071
in any process

133
00:06:13,171 --> 00:06:14,586
he perceives
as surrendering

134
00:06:14,686 --> 00:06:15,775
his power to another.

135
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,647
And are you
responsible for

136
00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:19,378
"our" patient's despair?

137
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:21,559
He believes
I am.

138
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:22,682
Where has
God gone?

139
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:23,750
I shall tell you.

140
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,718
God is dead.

141
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,119
We all have
killed him,

142
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:30,037
You, you,
you and I.

143
00:06:30,137 --> 00:06:31,131
(priest)
God will throw

144
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:31,758
you in hell!

145
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,526
After the death
of Buddha,

146
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,161
his shadow was shown
for centuries in caves.

147
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:38,063
A gruesome,
gruesome shadow,

148
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:39,055
God will
punish you!

149
00:06:39,155 --> 00:06:39,799
You are Satan!

150
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,055
Given the way
of people

151
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:41,434
[slam]

152
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,201
in the caves,
thank you,

153
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:45,019
for thousands of years,
in which God's shadow

154
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:45,872
will still be shown.

155
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,608
Vanquish the shadow
within yourself!

156
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,497
(man)
Friedrich. Friedrich.

157
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:51,678
Meet Lou Salome.

158
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,225
A brilliant poet
from Russia.

159
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:58,539
Fascinating lecture
to fall on so

160
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,485
few ears.

161
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,101
Why are people
so afraid of

162
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:02,054
you, professor?

163
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:05,704
Oh, truth is
a fearsome thing.

164
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:08,109
Why do you say
God is dead?

165
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:09,961
And not that
he never existed?

166
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:11,664
What you think?

167
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,746
That God has ceased
to be a reckoning force

168
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:14,667
in people's lives.

169
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,686
An interesting
interpretation.

170
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:19,605
But if God
is dead,

171
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,441
then everything
is permitted.

172
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,522
No morals,
no rules.

173
00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:27,980
Without God, who
will organize

174
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,414
our society?

175
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:31,363
What is the
solution to your

176
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:32,819
godless proposition?

177
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,356
From what stars
have we dropped down

178
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:36,756
to each other here?

179
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,357
auf Wiedersehen.

180
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,512
(Lou)
I was immediately

181
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:42,160
attracted to him.

182
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,112
Seduced by
his intellect.

183
00:07:45,212 --> 00:07:48,687
We could say so much
to each other with

184
00:07:48,787 --> 00:07:50,102
half sentences.

185
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:52,818
Mere gestures,

186
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:54,674
He became obsessed,

187
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,109
proposing marriage
after our first meeting,

188
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:59,628
I was attracted
to him.

189
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:02,631
But not romantically.

190
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:05,431
I wanted to learn.

191
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:07,152
Not to submit.

192
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:08,688
Stop it!

193
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,406
My refusal
turned his love

194
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:11,256
into hatred.

195
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:12,972
He wrote me
these crazed

196
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:14,326
insulting letters.

197
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:17,401
Then he wrote about
killing himself.

198
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,000
So if I understand
you correctly,

199
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,902
you want me
to persuade Nietzsche

200
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:25,738
that his life
is worth living.

201
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,958
But I must accomplish
this without him

202
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:29,842
knowing it.

203
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,545
You are the
only doctor qualified

204
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,365
for this
psychological treatment.

205
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:39,559
frau Reinhardt
is still waiting.

206
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,634
And still suffering.

207
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:44,757
(Lou)
One more thing,

208
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,257
You must read
his books,

209
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,875
I shall do
everything I can

210
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:07,964
to help your friend.

211
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,589
Good night,
Dr. Breuer.

212
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:50,756
(Breuer)
Good night,

213
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,949
Straight home,
fishman.

214
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,724
[gasping and sobbing]

215
00:10:16,214 --> 00:10:18,321
(Breuer)
Siegmund?

216
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:20,421
Siegmund?

217
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:22,588
Where are you
racing to?

218
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:23,848
The most charming woman
in Vienna invited

219
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:24,322
me for dinner.

220
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:26,258
Her more charming
husband is

221
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:29,053
on his way home
this very minute.

222
00:10:29,153 --> 00:10:30,696
Jump in, Siggy.

223
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,027
I diagnosed a liver
cancer today.

224
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:40,455
I never get used
to my patients dying.

225
00:10:40,555 --> 00:10:43,036
Well, get used
to it, young

226
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:45,136
Dr. Freud.

227
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,443
The children
are eating.

228
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:02,495
Say hello to them.

229
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:08,744
Daddy!

230
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:10,135
My little chickens.

231
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:11,737
See what I
mean, Siggy?

232
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,706
He hardly
talks to me.

233
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,172
[soft piano music]

234
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,201
Oh, by the way
I've taken on

235
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:27,486
a new patient.

236
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,160
I haven't
met him yet,

237
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,756
Suicidal tendencies,

238
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,021
As always,
it starts

239
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:34,560
with a woman.

240
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,852
But Josef,
love sickness is not

241
00:11:37,952 --> 00:11:40,048
a medical condition.

242
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:42,781
The story gets
even better.

243
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:44,670
Because the woman
feels guilty,

244
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,840
she wants me to sneak
in a cure for his

245
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,173
psychological distress.

246
00:11:48,273 --> 00:11:50,670
While at the same
time, I address his

247
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,943
physical ailments,

248
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:54,045
Surely, you're not
going to attempt this.

249
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:59,866
[sigh]

250
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:01,386
I have
already agreed.

251
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:02,455
Why?

252
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,819
I don't even
know myself.

253
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,529
Perhaps I need
a challenge like this.

254
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,798
You cannot say
no to this woman.

255
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:17,251
She could persuade
a horse to lay eggs.

256
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:18,530
(Lou)
Our plan

257
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,605
is working.

258
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,674
Dr. Oberbach
has persuaded

259
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,743
Nietzsche to consult you,

260
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,458
Neither I
nor Nietzsche

261
00:12:26,558 --> 00:12:29,180
shall ever forget
your kindness,

262
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,117
The professor
is here.

263
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:34,217
(Breuer)
Send him in,

264
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,609
Good day,
Herr Professor.

265
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:44,527
Please. Please,
have a seat.

266
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,123
Tell me about
your illness.

267
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,285
Would it be
more efficient

268
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:10,360
to review my
previous consultations?

269
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,404
I'm sure they're
excellent physicians,

270
00:13:13,504 --> 00:13:13,958
thank you.

271
00:13:14,058 --> 00:13:15,861
But I make
my own diagnosis

272
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,797
before reviewing
those of my colleagues,

273
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,932
Just as I prefer
to see a play before

274
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:23,007
reading the reviews,

275
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:48,438
Tell me, professor,
to what extent--

276
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:50,721
has melancholia
accompanied these

277
00:13:50,821 --> 00:13:51,963
migraine attacks?

278
00:13:52,063 --> 00:13:53,990
I have my black
periods but who

279
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,633
does not?

280
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:55,934
Speak not of me

281
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:57,570
tell me of
my illness.

282
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,970
What it
might be?

283
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,005
A life dominated
by black periods

284
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:02,875
is a breeding
ground for despair.

285
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,309
Despair?
No.

286
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:06,523
Perhaps once
but not now.

287
00:14:06,623 --> 00:14:07,747
No.

288
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,847
I'm just pregnant.

289
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,218
Here.

290
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:15,954
My headaches are
the labor pains for

291
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:17,222
my new book.

292
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:18,256
What book?

293
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,607
[sings loud]

294
00:14:20,707 --> 00:14:22,693
(Nietzsche3
Zarathustra!

295
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:26,097
A young prophet,
bursting with wisdom

296
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:27,535
and courage
and truthfulness

297
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:28,099
decides to

298
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:29,568
enlighten the people,

299
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,369
I teach you
the Ubermensch.

300
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:34,105
Man is something
that must be overcome.

301
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:37,095
What have you done
to overcome man?

302
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,714
What is
the ape

303
00:14:38,814 --> 00:14:39,344
to man?

304
00:14:39,444 --> 00:14:40,646
[laughter]

305
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,331
A laughingstock,
but I feel

306
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,947
no shame.

307
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:44,937
lust that,
man shall be

308
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:46,552
to the Ubermensch!

309
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,426
People refused
to understand

310
00:14:48,526 --> 00:14:49,287
those words.

311
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:51,792
The prophet,
realizing he has

312
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:52,957
come too soon

313
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:55,741
returns to
his solitude,

314
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:59,696
So--like--
Zarathustra,

315
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,700
I come
too soon.

316
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,562
I must ask you
a personal question.

317
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,779
Physical wellbeing
is not separable

318
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,749
from social and
psychological wellbeing.

319
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:20,478
Is there someone
with whom you have--

320
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:24,836
You referring
to sex... Doctor?

321
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:26,257
Well--

322
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:27,909
I have found
that a flash

323
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:29,227
of bestial pleasure

324
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:34,012
is followed by hours
of self-loathing, so,

325
00:15:34,112 --> 00:15:35,934
such herd pleasures
are not for me.

326
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:38,260
But is there
a Woman

327
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,839
in your life?

328
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,006
Every time I have
attempted to build

329
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:45,744
a footbridge to others,
I have been betrayed.

330
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,868
first, there was
the composer,

331
00:15:48,968 --> 00:15:50,482
Richard Wagner,

332
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,332
I have suffered
because of him,

333
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:55,871
and later,
my best friend--

334
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:59,948
with that--woman.

335
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,995
Tell me more
about that--woman.

336
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,296
And why?

337
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:09,480
It's connected
to your illness,

338
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,436
Trust me
on this.

339
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:15,063
I cannot afford
to--trust--again.

340
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,494
Then I believe,
Herr Professor,

341
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:21,312
that we can proceed
no further.

342
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:23,890
(Breuer)
Have a safe journey

343
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,885
home, Herr Professor.

344
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,951
[horse neighs]

345
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:29,051
(driver)
Stupid animal!

346
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,172
(Nietzsche)
Hey, out! Leave

347
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:33,124
the horse alone!

348
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:34,706
Leave it!
Leave it,

349
00:16:34,806 --> 00:16:35,661
I tell you!

350
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,228
[thud and gasp]

351
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:38,597
(Breuer)
Are you alright?

352
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,697
[neigh and shh]

353
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:46,869
[heavy breathing]

354
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,701
Can we meet--again?
[panting]

355
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,244
Friday afternoon,
same time?

356
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,321
Good night.

357
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,254
(Breuer)
Breathe deeply,

358
00:17:14,354 --> 00:17:14,833
Bertha.

359
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,462
Did you have
any dreams

360
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:17,302
last night?

361
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:21,183
Yes. I dreamt
you were making

362
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:22,708
love to me.

363
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:23,742
Really?

364
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,176
Yes.

365
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:26,689
I'm just going
to examine you,

366
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:27,345
don't worry.

367
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:28,681
It's perfectly normal,

368
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,732
What are you
doing? No!

369
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:33,736
I want you!

370
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:35,119
You are mine!

371
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:37,970
[laughter]

372
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,138
(female voice)
No, Josef!

373
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:42,594
No, Josef!

374
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:43,862
How could you?!

375
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:44,830
(Breuer)
Mathilde!

376
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,964
What are
you doing?!

377
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:48,199
That is horrible!
Horrible!!

378
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,715
Dr. Breuer!
You are now

379
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:53,472
a free man.

380
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,235
Go back,
you syphilitic

381
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:56,608
whore! He's mine!

382
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,710
No!
He's mine!

383
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,777
Mine!

384
00:17:58,877 --> 00:17:59,611
He is mine!

385
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:00,479
He's mine!

386
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,013
No!
He's mine!

387
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:04,741

and grunts]

389
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:23,165
[gasp]

390
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:29,300
(Breuer)
"There was a time

391
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,934
in our lives

392
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:31,703
"when we were
so close

393
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,394
"that nothing
seemed to obstruct

394
00:19:33,494 --> 00:19:34,238

"When only
a footprint

396
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,407
separated us.

"I asked you, 'Do
you want to cross

399
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:42,595
But you did
not want to."

400
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:44,750
What do you make
of it, Siggy?

401
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,685
I'm not sure.

402
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:50,160
Let's reason it out.
The first man can no

403
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,857
longer cross because

404
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,902
he feels he is
submitting his power

405
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:55,126
to the other person.

406
00:19:55,226 --> 00:19:57,707
Yes. Yes.
You're right.

407
00:19:57,807 --> 00:19:59,116
He interprets
any expression

408
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:00,231
of positive sentiment

409
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:01,933
as a bid
for power.

410
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,345
It makes it
almost impossible

411
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:04,368
to get close to him!

412
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:05,436
It's all here.

413
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:06,538
May I see it?

414
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,753
And reveal
his identity?

415
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:10,241
And why not?

416
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:12,076
Perhaps if you lend
this book to Siggy

417
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:13,635
you won't hide
in your study all

418
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:14,513
night reading it.

419
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:15,681
Mathilde, stop.

420
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,381
What am I to do
when I watch you

421
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:19,493
withdraw more and
more from me

422
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,752
and the children?

423
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,053
First that woman!

424
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:24,153
Now this Nietzsche!

425
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,258
Friedrich Nietzsche?

426
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:29,539
To this day I
regret listening

427
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:30,128
to you.

428
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,738
The transfer
of Bertha to

429
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:32,698
another doctor

430
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,323
remains one of
the great shames

431
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:37,398
of my life!

432
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:44,822
Excellent books.

433
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:46,911
Very few copies
of them sold.

434
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:48,746
Then your
publisher is

435
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:49,213
a fool

436
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:52,128
for not championing
these with his

437
00:20:52,228 --> 00:20:53,284
life's blood.

438
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:54,884
You're writing
in short and

439
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:55,888
brief sentences.

440
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,583
It is my ambition
to say in

441
00:20:57,683 --> 00:20:58,456
ten sentences

442
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:00,692
what others
say in a whole book,

443
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,792
Hm.

444
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:05,764
As to
your migraines,

445
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,017
I believe their
fundamental cause

446
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:09,100
lies in stress,

447
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,804
Due to upsetting
events in your work,

448
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:12,738
your family,

449
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,006
your personal
relationships.

450
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:18,059
I've given
up teaching.

451
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,545
I have no home
to look after,

452
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:20,746
no wife to
quarrel with,

453
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,146
no children
to discipline.

454
00:21:22,246 --> 00:21:23,896
I have
no obligations

455
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:24,716
to anyone.

456
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,217
I have no stress.

457
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:28,986
Your extreme isolation
is stressing itself,

458
00:21:29,086 --> 00:21:31,823
Great thinkers choose
their own company, no?

459
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,341
Undisturbed by
the mob.

460
00:21:34,441 --> 00:21:36,795
Consider Thoreau,
Spinoza, Buddha.

461
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,429
Professor.

462
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,298
Stress is
our enemy.

463
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:43,834
My task is to help you
reduce stress in

464
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:44,770
your life.

465
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,465
I propose that
you enter my

466
00:21:46,565 --> 00:21:47,338
Lauzon clinic

467
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:48,993
for one month
of observation

468
00:21:49,093 --> 00:21:49,875
and treatment.

469
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,183
We have
new medications

470
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:51,976
for migraine.

471
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:53,545
I will visit
you daily.

472
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:57,930
I'm unable to pay--
for such services.

473
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,165
Money doesn't
matter to me.

474
00:22:01,265 --> 00:22:02,487
It will be free.

475
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,308
And why
are you

476
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:05,724
doing this?

477
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,526
You came to
me for help.

478
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:08,827
I offer it.
I'm a doctor.

479
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,912
Far too simple.

480
00:22:11,012 --> 00:22:12,997
Human motivation
is far more complex.

481
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:14,198
What is
your motive?

482
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:16,067
Why are
you here?

483
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,583
Because of pressure
from my friends and

484
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:18,135
my headaches,

485
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:19,284
I ask again.
What is

486
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:19,971
your motive

487
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:21,623
if you don't
request payment

488
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:22,741
for such services.

489
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,176
One practices
one's profession.

490
00:22:25,276 --> 00:22:26,344
A cobbler cobbles.

491
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:28,480
A baker bakes.
A doctor doctors.

492
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,082
Why do you write?
Why philosophize?

493
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:32,684
You want nothing
from your work.

494
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,783
I do not claim
I philosophize

495
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:35,419
for you.

496
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:37,856
Whereas you, doctor,
continue to pretend

497
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,691
that your motive
is to serve me.

498
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,498
Such claims have
nothing to do with

499
00:22:41,598 --> 00:22:42,426
human motivation.

500
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:44,362
Now what
are your motives?

501
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:45,664
My motives?

502
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:46,464
Yes!

503
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:48,099
My motives?!

504
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:52,085
Who can answer
such a question?

505
00:22:52,185 --> 00:22:53,505
I believe you
are destined

506
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,006
to become
a great philosopher.

507
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:57,242
My mission is to aid
you in becoming

508
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,042
who you are.

509
00:22:58,142 --> 00:22:59,313
So you as my savior
can become

510
00:22:59,413 --> 00:22:59,910
even greater?

511
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,379
I did not
say that!

512
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,047
Do you know
my patients

513
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:04,301
are the leading
scientists and

514
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:05,182
musicians in Vienna?

515
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:06,951
Yes, and at this moment
you use their eminence

516
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:08,286
to enhance your
authority with me!

517
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,688
I will never
exploit your name.

518
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:10,932
I will still
be used

519
00:23:11,032 --> 00:23:11,422
by you!

520
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:13,090
Nonsense!

521
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,722
Your charity,
your techniques

522
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:15,393
to help me?

523
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:17,194
To manage me!

524
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:18,978
All of these
with you stronger

525
00:23:19,078 --> 00:23:19,865
at my expense!

526
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,633
This is a perfect
example of why

527
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,301
you cannot dissect
your own psyche!

528
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,382
Your vision is
blurred, Professor!

529
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:28,518
You need help!

530
00:23:28,618 --> 00:23:30,257
You are
about to make

531
00:23:30,357 --> 00:23:31,942
a mistake!

532
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:34,042
Then go
already!

533
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,117
You crazed
deluded creature!

Take the pain.
Take the pain in.

You will
feel better.

Help me.

[gasp]

555
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:46,136
That much chlorine
is a poison

556

in the sleeping juice
so you could

557
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:48,473
have died.

Oh, living, dying,
who cares?

559
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:54,202
I shall be in
your office tomorrow

560

00:26:59,216 --> 00:27:00,284
Yes.

564
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:01,217
Not until
this crisis

565
00:27:01,317 --> 00:27:01,620
is over.

566
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,301
I'm leaving tomorrow.

567
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:06,948
[waltz music]

568
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,689
You know,
part of me

569
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:27,912
holds some--

570
00:27:28,012 --> 00:27:29,986
strange hope that
by helping this

571
00:27:30,086 --> 00:27:31,048
bizarre creature

572
00:27:31,148 --> 00:27:33,117
overcome his
own suffering,

573
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:35,833
I might
defeat my own,

574
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:38,237
Defeat your suffering?

575
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:39,824
You're the envy
of every doctor

576
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:40,391
in Vienna.

577
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:42,476
One feels
things at 4O

578
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:44,680
that one cannot
possibly know

579
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,195
at 25.

580
00:27:45,295 --> 00:27:47,748
I must stop him
from leaving.

581
00:27:47,848 --> 00:27:50,164
There must
be a way.

582
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:54,119
Perhaps if you'd
fully disclosed

583
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:55,540
yourself to Nietzsche,

584
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,850
you might have
engaged him.

585
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:00,044
Once you
gain his trust,

586
00:28:00,144 --> 00:28:02,037
he might
open up like

587
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:04,137
a steamed clam.

588
00:28:06,316 --> 00:28:08,611
I think I know
a way, Siggy.

589
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,372
I think
I know

590
00:28:14,472 --> 00:28:15,225
a way.

591
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:17,603
Your documents
and receipts,

592
00:28:17,703 --> 00:28:18,897
Herr Professor.

593
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,981
Auf Wiedersehen.

594
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:23,065
Auf Wiedersehen.

595
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:26,805
[door opens]

596
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,723
Professor Nietzsche.

597
00:28:29,823 --> 00:28:32,698
May I have a word
before you leave?

598
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,456
I have a proposition
to make, Professor,

599
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:48,823
Perhaps never before
made by a doctor

600
00:28:48,923 --> 00:28:50,923
to his patient.

601
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:56,934
I propose a
professional exchange.

602
00:28:57,034 --> 00:29:00,277
for one month,
I will act as

603
00:29:00,377 --> 00:29:03,120
physician to your body,

604
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,077
if you will act
as physician

605
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:05,909
to my mind.

606
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:07,779
What do
you mean?

607
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,204
That you doctor me
and I teach

608
00:29:10,304 --> 00:29:11,483
you philosophy?

609
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,916
No, no, no.

610
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:15,902
Not teach me.

611
00:29:16,002 --> 00:29:17,321
Heal me.

612
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:18,623
Of what?

613
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,723
Despair.

614
00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:39,009
I see
no despair.

615
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:41,359
Not on
the surface.

616
00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:43,013
But underneath,

617
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:46,499
my mind is invaded
by alien thoughts.

618
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:48,419
I've lost sight
of why I live.

619
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,635
I'm terrified
of death, yet--

620
00:29:51,735 --> 00:29:54,642
I often think
of ending my life.

621
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:57,910
I cannot help
you with this.

622
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,430
I've no training.

623
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,098
Who is trained?

624
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:03,182
Such healing
is not a part of

625
00:30:03,282 --> 00:30:04,902
the medical discipline.

626
00:30:05,002 --> 00:30:05,881
What do
I know

627
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:06,503
of this?

628
00:30:06,603 --> 00:30:08,205
You know more
than any man alive.

629
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:10,689
Aren't your books
entire treaties

630
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:11,576
on despair?

631
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:14,452
I can't cure despair.
I only know how

632
00:30:14,552 --> 00:30:15,680
to tolerate it.

633
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,294
Then teach me
how to tolerate

634
00:30:18,394 --> 00:30:19,617
a life
of despair.

635
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,552
You were right that
your mission is

636
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:25,690
to save humankind
from illusion

637
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,907
and aimlessness.

638
00:30:28,007 --> 00:30:29,615
To create
a new code

639
00:30:29,715 --> 00:30:30,695
of behavior.

640
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,630
A new morality
free of superstition.

641
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,846
It's all there.
In your books.

642
00:30:35,946 --> 00:30:37,885
This is my offer.

643
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:39,981
You enter
my clinic

644
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:41,405
for 30 days.

645
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:45,109
I will observe and treat
your medical illness daily.

646
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,993
In return,
you become

647
00:30:47,093 --> 00:30:48,212
my physician,

648
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:51,165
and help
me talk about

649
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:53,830
my life's concerns.

650
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,319
Look.

651
00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:59,869
I'm indebted
to you--

652
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:01,958
more than
any man.

653
00:31:05,262 --> 00:31:07,262
You saved
my life.

654
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:12,228
I'm just
a writer.

655
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:17,038
I'm not
a doctor.

656
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,532
You can pay
your debt by

657
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:23,715
saving my life.

658
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,976
The way I
saved yours,

659
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:32,189
So what?

660
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:36,373
I do this
for you to--

661
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:38,460
relieve my debt?

662
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,681
My motivation--

663
00:31:42,781 --> 00:31:45,201
is entirely
self-serving.

664
00:31:47,371 --> 00:31:50,187
I want
to save

665
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:51,975
my life,

666
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:54,090
but are you
strong enough

667
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,165
to do this?

668
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,926
(Breuer)
I will persuade him

669
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:11,775
that he is
the only one

670
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,854
who can help me.

671
00:32:13,954 --> 00:32:15,065
And then what?

672
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:17,915
Then I will
reverse the roles.

673
00:32:18,015 --> 00:32:19,771
He will once again
be the patient

674
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,972
and I will be
the physician.

675
00:32:22,072 --> 00:32:24,007
And what happens
when Nietzsche

676
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:26,243
turns to you
to cure his despair?

677
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:28,433
Siggy, I'm convinced
there's something

678
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:29,814
healing in unburdening.

679
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,583
Look at
the Catholics.

680
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,175
Their priests have been
offering confessions

681
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:35,052
for centuries.

682
00:32:35,152 --> 00:32:38,735
Nietzsche is
a solitary man.

683
00:32:38,835 --> 00:32:41,505
Yet a few
nights ago

684
00:32:41,605 --> 00:32:44,274
he opened up
to me.

685
00:32:44,374 --> 00:32:45,963
A real plea
for help.

686
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:47,297
Help me.

687
00:32:47,397 --> 00:32:51,081
What you saw were
his unconscious desires.

688
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:53,108
Those that if they
were liberated

689
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:53,904
could scream

690
00:32:54,004 --> 00:32:55,989
for help
in daylight.

691
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:57,908
The goal of
my talking cure

692
00:32:58,008 --> 00:33:00,010
is to liberate those
buried desires,

693
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,759
to allow the patient
to ask for

694
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:06,839
help--openly.

695
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:08,493
(Sigmund)
But is "liberation Integration"

696
00:33:08,593 --> 00:33:09,152
the right term?

697
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:12,779
Isn't it "integration"
that we are after?

698
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,927
Integration of
the unconscious

699
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:20,798
with the conscious.

700
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,898
Yes!

701
00:33:26,536 --> 00:33:28,536
Yes, Sigmund!

702
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,952
Very good.

703
00:33:51,361 --> 00:33:53,361
Take a seat.

704
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:00,642
Remove your stethoscope.

705
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,342
And your coat.

706
00:34:05,442 --> 00:34:07,442
As well.

707
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,525
I made a list
of your complaints,

708
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,127
One, you have a
general unhappiness.

709
00:34:24,227 --> 00:34:28,446
Two, you're besieged
by alien thoughts,

710
00:34:28,546 --> 00:34:30,200
Three, self-hatred.

711
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,950
four, fear of aging,
five, fear of death,

712
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:38,323
Six, urges
toward suicide,

713
00:34:38,423 --> 00:34:39,544
Anything else?

714
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:44,593
I feel--

715
00:34:44,693 --> 00:34:46,763
completely--

716
00:34:46,863 --> 00:34:48,653
remote and distant
from my wife.

717
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,708
Trapped in a world
not of my

718
00:34:50,808 --> 00:34:51,723
own choosing,

719
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,916
And is that
One more

720
00:34:54,016 --> 00:34:56,016
problem or two?

721
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,062
You make me
feel uncomfortable.

722
00:34:59,162 --> 00:35:00,831
It is my task
to make you

723
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:02,099
feel comfortless.

724
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:02,885
No, no, no.
Your approach

725
00:35:02,985 --> 00:35:03,333
is all wrong.

726
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:04,913
Mr. Breuer,
we made

727
00:35:05,013 --> 00:35:07,013
an agreement.

728
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,673
"Mr." Breuer?

729
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,904
Do you want
us to proceed,

730
00:35:16,004 --> 00:35:18,004
Mr. Breuer?

731
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,764
You've mentioned
your wife last,

732
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,632
Which tells me
it begins there.

733
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,618
What initiated
this change--

734
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,036
in your feelings
toward her?

735
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,387
[gentle thunder]

736
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:44,041
[clears throat]

737
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:45,708
Two years ago
I took on the case

738
00:35:45,808 --> 00:35:46,644
of a young woman.

739
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,163
This patient
--I gave her the

740
00:35:49,263 --> 00:35:50,947
pseudonym Anna O. --

741
00:35:51,047 --> 00:35:53,755
suffers from what
we doctors call

742
00:35:53,855 --> 00:35:55,486
hysterical behavior,

743
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:56,920
[screams]

744
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,337
Try to stay calm!

745
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:01,015
(Breuer)
During our daily

746
00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:02,092
meetings, she--

747
00:36:02,192 --> 00:36:04,303
opened up to me,
She had the details

748
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:05,897
of every disturbing event

749
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,981
of the last 24 hours.

750
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:10,342
She called
these confessions

751
00:36:10,442 --> 00:36:12,424
"chimney-sweeping."

752
00:36:13,236 --> 00:36:15,453
[clears throat]

753
00:36:15,553 --> 00:36:19,859
I prefer to call it--
the talking cure.

754
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,813
Unfortunately,

755
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,413
the course
of treatment

756
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:24,449
was terminated

757
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,850
by its insane ending,

758
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,150
How?

759
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,366
I fell in love
with my patient.

760
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:33,192
She and her mother
were friendly

761
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:35,292
with my wife.

762
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:40,445
[heavy breathing]

763
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:42,530
Bertha.

764
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,902
What's wrong?

765
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,969
Stop it, Bertha!

766
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,524
What's wrong?

767
00:36:51,624 --> 00:36:53,906
I'm pregnant!

768
00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:58,757
I'm pregnant with
your husband's baby!

769
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,251
(mother)
Bertha!

770
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:04,590
(Bertha)
Here comes Dr. Breuer's

771
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,890
little baby!

772
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,973
Bertha!
No!

773
00:37:08,073 --> 00:37:09,594
Stop it!

774
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:13,411
Stop it!
Bertha!

775
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:16,330
It was her delirium
speaking, of course,

776
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,267
her illness.

777
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:18,645
But my wife
forbade me

778
00:37:18,745 --> 00:37:19,770
to see her again,

779
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,505
What did
you do?

780
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:24,555
I'm sorry, my dear.
I cannot be your

781
00:37:24,655 --> 00:37:26,009
doctor anymore,

782
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:27,712
But I've done
nothing wrong.

783
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,393
Of course
you haven't.

784
00:37:30,493 --> 00:37:31,827
I will refer you
to a colleague

785
00:37:31,927 --> 00:37:32,249
of mine.

786
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:34,475
He will take
good care

787
00:37:34,575 --> 00:37:35,218
of you.

788
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:36,920
Please don't
let me go.

789
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,352
I have no choice.

790
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:50,767
You will always be
the only man in

791
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:52,135
my life. Always.

792
00:37:52,235 --> 00:37:54,748
Can you imagine
how terrible it was

793
00:37:54,848 --> 00:37:56,306
to hear those words?

794
00:37:56,406 --> 00:38:00,294
They were evidence
of the damage

795
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:01,712
I had done.

796
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:06,030
I left her weakened.

797
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:07,818
Crippled.

798
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:12,898
You are responsible
for all of your thoughts

799
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:14,090
and deeds.

800
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:18,977
But she, by virtue
of the so-called illness,

801
00:38:19,077 --> 00:38:20,631
she is exonerated.

802
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,332
from everything.

803
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:25,128
Who has
damaged whom?

804
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,804
Who has
weakened whom?

805
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:33,061
Doesn't this cripple
Bertha, as you

806
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:35,159
call her--

807
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:39,830
have greater power
over you?

808
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,930
An excellent beginning.

809
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,333
He even developed
a list of my problems,

810
00:38:46,056 --> 00:38:48,373
Breuer is
a curious mix,

811
00:38:48,473 --> 00:38:50,573
Intelligent yet blind.

812
00:38:50,673 --> 00:38:52,462
Sincere but devious,

813
00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:54,472
Let him continue
to think that this

814
00:38:54,572 --> 00:38:55,733
is what we are doing,

815
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,014
He's possessed
by a woman who

816
00:38:58,114 --> 00:38:59,737
shreds him to pieces,

817
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,872
[chuckles]
And he licks

818
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:03,507
her bloody fangs,

819
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:06,689
[Nietzsche,
laughing hard]

820
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:08,044
I love it, Josef.

821
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:09,447
What do you love?

822
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:10,548
Tchaikovsky!

823
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:11,682
Why?

824
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,782
Swan Lake!

825
00:39:19,522 --> 00:39:21,324
[bells ringing]

826
00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:23,426
[Breuer screams
and Nietzsche laughs]

827
00:39:23,526 --> 00:39:25,393
Josef, look!
We're running

828
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:26,363
out of time!

829
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:29,557
[thunder]

830
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:35,188
Backwards!
Look at the time!

831
00:39:35,288 --> 00:39:37,537
Faster, Josef!
Pedal faster!

832
00:39:37,637 --> 00:39:39,902
[Swan Lake ballet, playing]

833
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:45,329
Take me, Josef.
Take me!

834
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:48,301
Throw away
your shackles!

835
00:39:48,401 --> 00:39:50,821
Sticks and stones
may break my bones,

836
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,570
but death will
never hurt me!

837
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:59,526
[Swan Lake, playing
and thunder]

838
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:10,085
[gasping
and thunder]

839
00:40:10,185 --> 00:40:12,665
(Breuer)
I feared that after

840
00:40:12,765 --> 00:40:14,959
yesterday's confessions,

841
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:16,446
you would
think less of me.

842
00:40:16,546 --> 00:40:19,214
Do not worry
about what others

843
00:40:19,314 --> 00:40:20,450
think of you.

844
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,153
I suspect you find
sex disagreeable.

845
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:24,492
I do
not object

846
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:25,155
to sex.

847
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:26,569
What I hate
is the man

848
00:40:26,669 --> 00:40:27,658
who begs for it.

849
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,193
He surrenders himself
to some crafty woman

850
00:40:30,293 --> 00:40:32,929
who turns his lust
into her strings.

851
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:34,598
Lust is part
of life!

852
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,383
And nothing must
interfere with

853
00:40:36,483 --> 00:40:37,300
the development

854
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,322
of the hero
which is

855
00:40:38,422 --> 00:40:38,935
inside you!

856
00:40:39,035 --> 00:40:41,588
And if lust stands
in the way, lust

857
00:40:41,688 --> 00:40:42,939
must be overcome!

858
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:44,407
(Breuer)
Be more practical.

859
00:40:44,507 --> 00:40:46,459
All you give me
are quotes from

860
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:47,243
your books!

861
00:40:47,343 --> 00:40:50,540
first time I've attempted
to put my philosophy

862
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,816
to practical use,

863
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:56,303
Choose between comfort
and the truth.

864
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:58,188
Are they
mutually exclusive?

865
00:40:58,288 --> 00:41:00,523
If you want to choose
the pleasure of growth,

866
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:02,258
prepare yourself
for some pain.

867
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:04,032
Less pain, shrink.
Go. Be part

868
00:41:04,132 --> 00:41:04,795
of the herd.

869
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,347
[soft playing]

870
00:41:07,447 --> 00:41:09,430
[abrupt loud notes]

871
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,501
Look at
this tree.

872
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:13,699
It requires
stormy weather

873
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:16,005
if it is to attain
its proud height.

874
00:41:16,105 --> 00:41:20,391
Learn, creativity
and discovery,

875
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:22,477
But they
come in pain!

876
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,376
(Breuer)
I wish for

877
00:41:25,476 --> 00:41:26,550
simple things.

878
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,390
To sleep
without nightmares

879
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,287
[sigh]

880
00:41:31,387 --> 00:41:34,151
to live
without tension.

881
00:41:37,227 --> 00:41:39,227
Lie down.

882
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:41,732
Why?

883
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,414
It's the
best inducement

884
00:41:44,514 --> 00:41:47,901
for recalling memories.
Lie down, please.

885
00:41:56,112 --> 00:41:58,112
Close your eyes,

886
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,933
Let us
imagine

887
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:08,103
An icy
mountain peak,

888
00:42:08,203 --> 00:42:10,088
And we see
this little man

889
00:42:10,188 --> 00:42:11,695
trudging to the top.

890
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:13,342
He's looking
into the horror

891
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:14,397
of his existence.

892
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:17,333
He is encountering
times that are endured.

893
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:18,435
[thunder]

894
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:20,370
But he sees
too much.

895
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:24,781
This insignificance,
this mere

896
00:42:24,881 --> 00:42:26,610
little speck

897
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,077
that he is.

898
00:42:28,177 --> 00:42:29,379
[loud thunder]

899
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:33,231
And now his fear
becomes so raw,

900
00:42:33,331 --> 00:42:37,034
that he welcomes
lust into his mind.

901
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:40,089
And he starts looking
into this castle.

902
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:42,647
He begins to spend
his time recollecting

903
00:42:42,747 --> 00:42:43,661
these miracles,

904
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,877
How his little
crippled Bertha

905
00:42:46,977 --> 00:42:49,782
moves her legs,

906
00:42:49,882 --> 00:42:52,685
Her lips.

907
00:42:52,785 --> 00:42:55,250
And her arms.

908
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:58,021
And her breasts.

909
00:42:58,121 --> 00:43:00,256
And his mind

910
00:43:00,356 --> 00:43:03,460
which was filled
with the noblest

911
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,280
of ideas

912
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:10,134
becomes clogged
now with trash.

913
00:43:10,234 --> 00:43:12,672
And that is how
he is today,

914
00:43:12,772 --> 00:43:16,738
He's just rummaging
through the rubbish.

915
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:18,841
Of Bertha.

916
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:21,284
As if it contained
the answer

917
00:43:21,384 --> 00:43:23,359
to his prayers,

918
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:27,711
Well, what do
you think

919
00:43:27,811 --> 00:43:29,239
of this man?

920
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:33,435
Josef, open
your eyes.

921
00:43:35,044 --> 00:43:37,044
Open your eyes,

922
00:43:47,557 --> 00:43:49,557
Talk to me,
Josef.

923
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,283
This is
my way.

924
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,366
Where is yours?

925
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:06,003
[cheerful piano music]

926
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,715
He asked you to lie
on the couch? Why?

927
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,000
He said it
was the best way

928
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,075
for recalling memories.

929
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,054
Interesting.

930
00:44:18,154 --> 00:44:20,089
He is honoring
his contract,

931
00:44:20,189 --> 00:44:21,725
but offers
no support,

932
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,062
My confessions
have failed

933
00:44:23,162 --> 00:44:23,627
to produce

934
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,402
even the slightest
admission of his

935
00:44:25,502 --> 00:44:26,162
own obsession.

936
00:44:26,262 --> 00:44:28,326
Is your frustration rooted
in your competition

937
00:44:28,426 --> 00:44:28,799
with him?

938
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:31,880
Not at all.

939
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,387
I'm a physician,
Siggy.

940
00:44:34,487 --> 00:44:36,362
I do not meet with
my patient for

941
00:44:36,462 --> 00:44:37,140
my pleasure.

942
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,934
But Josef,
I've read

943
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:39,877
his books.

944
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,579
He has more
penetrating knowledge

945
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,145
of mankind

946
00:44:42,245 --> 00:44:44,973
than any other person.
I think, he may

947
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:45,849
be, perhaps

948
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,217
the greatest psychologist
who has ever lived.

949
00:44:48,317 --> 00:44:51,104
You can best
help him by letting

950
00:44:51,204 --> 00:44:53,204
him help you.

951
00:44:54,123 --> 00:44:59,288
[soft piano music]

952
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:14,704
[woman sings

953
00:46:00,256 --> 00:46:02,816
[heavy rain
and thunder]

954
00:46:07,163 --> 00:46:08,431
Josef?

955
00:46:08,531 --> 00:46:10,849
[pigeons cooing]

956
00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:15,200
[crashing thunder]

957
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:19,438
Josef? It's
after midnight.

958
00:46:21,644 --> 00:46:23,644
Are you coming
to bed?

959
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:26,681
Soon.

960
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,020
(distant female voice)
Dr. Breuer!

961
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:47,871
Dr. Breuer!

962
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,673
Dr. Breuer!

963
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:50,907
Where is
my wife?

964
00:46:51,007 --> 00:46:53,076
Your wife--
is in the house!

965
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:55,176
Mathilde!

966
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,726
Mathilde!

967
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,144
(Bertha)
You'll always be

968
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,562
the only man in my life.

969
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,196
Always,

970
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:16,500
(Bertha)
You'll never regret

971
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,600
it, Josef. Never.

972
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:25,372
You will never
regret it, Josef.

973
00:47:25,472 --> 00:47:26,008
Never.

974
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:28,994
[ship siren]

975
00:47:29,094 --> 00:47:31,273
[crashing thunder]

976
00:47:40,456 --> 00:47:42,158
I feel healthy.

977
00:47:42,258 --> 00:47:43,365
I wish to waste
none of our

978
00:47:43,465 --> 00:47:43,993
precious time

979
00:47:44,093 --> 00:47:46,388
on these physical
exams, hm?

980
00:47:48,397 --> 00:47:50,614
Uh, before
we begin,

981
00:47:50,714 --> 00:47:55,887
the last time we met
you called me "Josef."

982
00:47:55,987 --> 00:47:58,559
I like that.
Should we use

983
00:47:58,659 --> 00:48:00,659
first names?

984
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,851
Friedrich or--?

985
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:09,951
Fritz.

986
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,258
Friedrich.

987
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:17,315
My best friend
at school was

988
00:48:17,415 --> 00:48:18,629
called Friedrich.

989
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,458
He used
to call me the lad

990
00:48:20,558 --> 00:48:21,931
of infinite promise.

991
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:25,113
What happened
to the lad?

992
00:48:25,213 --> 00:48:26,936
He became
a successful doctor.

993
00:48:27,036 --> 00:48:30,253
And respected,
And rich,

994
00:48:30,353 --> 00:48:35,159
Then you have
fulfilled your goals.

995
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:37,663
You are satisfied?

996
00:48:37,763 --> 00:48:41,133
I have fulfilled
my goals, yes.

997
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:43,344
Am I satisfied?

998
00:48:45,454 --> 00:48:46,489
No.

999
00:48:46,589 --> 00:48:49,054
How did you
choose your goals?

1000
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:52,605
No, don't--
don't think.

1001
00:48:52,705 --> 00:48:54,263
lust chimney-sweep,

1002
00:48:54,363 --> 00:48:56,363
Hm.

1003
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,819
Goals are
part of my culture.

1004
00:49:00,919 --> 00:49:03,692
They're in the air.
You breathe

1005
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:04,473
them in.

1006
00:49:04,573 --> 00:49:06,442
Like every
young Jewish boy,

1007
00:49:06,542 --> 00:49:09,291
I wanted to climb
out of the ghetto

1008
00:49:09,391 --> 00:49:10,246
to succeed.

1009
00:49:10,346 --> 00:49:12,871
My father was
the great teacher

1010
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:14,946
of my life.

1011
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,119
No, Papa.

1012
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:19,489
No, Josef.
I won't encourage

1013
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,564
bad habits.

1014
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:29,282
But I never
chose goals.

1015
00:49:29,382 --> 00:49:32,082
They were
just there, like--

1016
00:49:32,182 --> 00:49:33,469
like an accident.

1017
00:49:33,569 --> 00:49:35,064
And yet not
to take possession

1018
00:49:35,164 --> 00:49:35,806
of your goals

1019
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:38,091
is just that,
let your life

1020
00:49:38,191 --> 00:49:40,166
be an accident.

1021
00:49:51,253 --> 00:49:53,537
What is
wrong, Josef?

1022
00:49:53,637 --> 00:49:56,474
I've had a sudden
and painful understanding

1023
00:49:56,574 --> 00:49:57,560
of the obvious.

1024
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,877
Time is irreversible,

1025
00:49:59,977 --> 00:50:02,666
The sands of my life
are running out,

1026
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:05,021
I'm in lockstep
with all people

1027
00:50:05,121 --> 00:50:07,069
marching towards my death.

1028
00:50:07,169 --> 00:50:10,454
So you see clear
vision as a wound,

1029
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:12,609
Knowing that as
my death approaches,

1030
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,512
I'm impotent and
insignificant, yes.

1031
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,147
That does not mean
that existence has

1032
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:17,681
no purpose.

1033
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:19,269
On the contrary,
As death

1034
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:20,216
creeps closer,

1035
00:50:20,316 --> 00:50:21,752
the value
of life increases.

1036
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,687
You must learn
to say "Yes, " Josef,

1037
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,709
But say "yes"
to every minute

1038
00:50:25,809 --> 00:50:26,322
of life.

1039
00:50:26,422 --> 00:50:28,005
Be passionate.
Be a free

1040
00:50:28,105 --> 00:50:29,191
thinking spirit.

1041
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:31,060
Rise above
your limitations.

1042
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,893
Be the Ubermensch.
Hm? Please.

1043
00:50:40,136 --> 00:50:42,661
Please, Fraulein.
Will you take

1044
00:50:42,761 --> 00:50:44,736
a seat?

1045
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:46,908
The Russian
is here.

1046
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,805
Let her wait.

1047
00:50:55,117 --> 00:50:57,117
[chiming]

1048
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:05,713
Good afternoon,
Frau Pettik. Please

1049
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:06,730
take a seat.

1050
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,214
Herr Schubert,
hello.

1051
00:51:09,314 --> 00:51:11,534
Take a seat. The doctor
will be with you shortly.

1052
00:51:11,634 --> 00:51:13,436
Please, understand,
I'm very sorry.

1053
00:51:13,536 --> 00:51:16,171
Please, the doctor
will see you,

1054
00:51:23,012 --> 00:51:25,142
frau Pettik,
the doctor

1055
00:51:25,242 --> 00:51:27,242
can see you now.

1056
00:51:39,595 --> 00:51:40,797
What a pleasure.

1057
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:42,699
I had forgotten,

1058
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:44,052
Then look
more carefully

1059
00:51:44,152 --> 00:51:44,668
this time.

1060
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,309
I'm distressed
at having so little

1061
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:48,772
time to offer you.

1062
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,522
The price
of success,

1063
00:51:50,622 --> 00:51:52,622
Dr. Breuer.

1064
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,421
You like to
live dangerously.

1065
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:07,524
Tell me, why
didn't you write

1066
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,784
so that I could
arrange a proper

1067
00:52:09,884 --> 00:52:10,761
time for you?

1068
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:13,577
I am concerned
about our patient.

1069
00:52:13,677 --> 00:52:15,364
Our patient?

1070
00:52:15,464 --> 00:52:17,366
Have you graduated
from medical school

1071
00:52:17,466 --> 00:52:18,802
since our
last meeting?

1072
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:20,548
You must read
these letters

1073
00:52:20,648 --> 00:52:21,772
Nietzsche sent me.

1074
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,707
He writes
as if to punish me.

1075
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,222
"You are a woman
without sensitivity

1076
00:52:26,322 --> 00:52:26,976
or spirit,

1077
00:52:27,076 --> 00:52:29,983
incapable of love,
a predator clothed

1078
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:31,347
as a house cat."

1079
00:52:31,447 --> 00:52:33,400
Why does he
regard me as

1080
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,452
such a monster?

1081
00:52:37,086 --> 00:52:39,127
I deserve to know
the outcome

1082
00:52:39,227 --> 00:52:40,222
of my efforts.

1083
00:52:40,322 --> 00:52:43,303
The outcome
of your experiment.

1084
00:52:43,403 --> 00:52:47,408
It's been lovely
to see you,

1085
00:52:47,508 --> 00:52:48,644
but I must
return to

1086
00:52:48,744 --> 00:52:49,198
my work.

1087
00:52:49,298 --> 00:52:50,366
Where is he?

1088
00:52:50,466 --> 00:52:51,635
I cannot tell you.

1089
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,202
Or the state
of his condition.

1090
00:52:53,302 --> 00:52:54,697
You turn
your back

1091
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:55,237
to me.

1092
00:52:55,337 --> 00:53:00,468
I cannot violate
my patient's--privacy.

1093
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,849
[slam]

1094
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,119
(Sigmund)
Perhaps you are

1095
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:15,725
not capable

1096
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:17,460
of being hypnotized.

1097
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,574
Perhaps,

1098
00:53:19,674 --> 00:53:22,000
I didn't tell you she
left some of Nietzsche's

1099
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:22,899
letters with me.

1100
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,366
Hm. And?

1101
00:53:24,466 --> 00:53:26,415
He berates me
for feeding at

1102
00:53:26,515 --> 00:53:27,871
the trough of lust,

1103
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,247
and all the while,
he himself,

1104
00:53:30,347 --> 00:53:31,340
just like me,

1105
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,020
is rummaging
through the trash

1106
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,083
of his own mind.

1107
00:53:37,183 --> 00:53:38,816
You think he
should answer

1108
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:40,449
for his falsifications,

1109
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:42,118
may I remind you
of your own.

1110
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:45,848
Of the deceptive premise
of your arrangement

1111
00:53:45,948 --> 00:53:47,923
with him.

1112
00:53:49,425 --> 00:53:51,828
Of the two patients
in this relationship,

1113
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:55,455
I have become
the more urgent case.

1114

General.

1115
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:08,978
What are you
doing, soldier?

1116
00:54:09,078 --> 00:54:10,747
Trying to kill
myself, sir.

1117
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,214
Carry on, soldier.

1118
00:54:12,314 --> 00:54:14,083
Yes, sir.

General, help

1121
00:54:19,964 --> 00:54:21,964
me please!

1122
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,734
The interesting thing
is that in my dream

1123
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,893
the general
was you.

1124
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,621
And why me?

1125
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:39,716
A symbol of
your unwillingness

1126
00:54:39,816 --> 00:54:40,476
to join me

1127
00:54:40,576 --> 00:54:43,245
in a down-to-earth
manner perhaps?

1128
00:54:43,345 --> 00:54:46,461
Be open
with me.

1129
00:54:46,561 --> 00:54:48,350
I presume that,
like all men,

1130
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:51,340
you've suffered
from love-sickness.

1131
00:54:53,522 --> 00:54:58,505
Have you ever tasted
the pain of love?

1132
00:54:58,605 --> 00:55:00,594
Yes.

1133
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:03,130
And?

1134
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,769
I must know.

1135
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:09,688
Let me remind you
of Goethe's words.

1136
00:55:09,788 --> 00:55:13,389
"Be a man.
Do not follow me,

1137
00:55:13,489 --> 00:55:14,878
but yourself, "

1138
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,824
Teaching philosophy
and using it

1139
00:55:16,924 --> 00:55:17,913
in the real world

1140
00:55:18,013 --> 00:55:20,798
are Very
different undertakings.

1141
00:55:20,898 --> 00:55:22,985
You wish for something
to soothe you now.

1142
00:55:23,085 --> 00:55:25,039
Then go, suckle
on the teat

1143
00:55:25,139 --> 00:55:26,322
of superstition,

1144
00:55:26,422 --> 00:55:29,091
Whatever you do,
don't go to reason,

1145
00:55:29,191 --> 00:55:31,148
Unfortunately, the
theatrical director

1146
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:31,795
of my mind,

1147
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,785
the one who stages
all these scenes

1148
00:55:33,885 --> 00:55:34,463
with Bertha

1149
00:55:34,563 --> 00:55:36,265
is unaffected
by reason.

1150
00:55:36,365 --> 00:55:37,754
Of course not.
for what reason

1151
00:55:37,854 --> 00:55:38,300
will a man

1152
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,869
could love
such a cripple?

1153
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,203
Oh, stop it!

1154
00:55:41,303 --> 00:55:43,906
Bertha is intelligent,
beautiful, loving!

1155
00:55:44,006 --> 00:55:45,207
Loving?
How?

1156
00:55:45,307 --> 00:55:46,440
She tried
to seduce you

1157
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:47,243
into adultery.

1158
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,694
She almost
destroyed you,

1159
00:55:49,794 --> 00:55:51,380
You are too
hard on her.

1160
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,716
Well, next time
you go to her,

1161
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:55,084
don't forget
to bring your whip.

1162
00:55:55,184 --> 00:55:57,158
Yes. I think to love
such a woman

1163
00:55:57,258 --> 00:55:58,220
is to hate life.

1164
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,969
Bertha is
a fine woman.

1165
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:02,759
May I remind you
she became ill

1166
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,393
because of her
father's death?

1167
00:56:04,493 --> 00:56:06,863
And may I remind
you all fathers die?

1168
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:10,023
I think the time
for excuses is over.

1169
00:56:17,539 --> 00:56:19,539
[happy laughter]

1170
00:56:22,411 --> 00:56:23,662
(Bertha)
You will always be

1171
00:56:23,762 --> 00:56:24,913
the only man in my life.

1172
00:56:25,013 --> 00:56:26,275
(Breuer)
friedrich, I need

1173
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:26,850
your help.

1174
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,118
Attack my obsession,
It's ruining me!

1175
00:56:29,218 --> 00:56:31,603
Do you want war?

1176
00:56:31,703 --> 00:56:33,022
Yes!

1177
00:56:33,122 --> 00:56:34,463
You will follow
my directives

1178
00:56:34,563 --> 00:56:35,357
without question.

1179
00:56:35,457 --> 00:56:36,425
Absolutely.

1180
00:56:36,525 --> 00:56:38,525
Sit.

1181
00:56:40,195 --> 00:56:42,195
Please.

1182
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,100
Close your eyes.

1183
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,783
[sigh]

1184
00:56:47,883 --> 00:56:52,320
Imagine--your life--
with Bertha.

1185
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,877
But I don't
want to!

1186
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:56,468
Please, Josef.
Relax.

1187
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:04,936
Now, you're
starting your day.

1188
00:57:05,036 --> 00:57:08,052
You're having
your breakfast,

1189
00:57:08,152 --> 00:57:09,391
with Anna O.

1190
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:15,442
I want you to compose
a list of 1 O insults

1191
00:57:15,542 --> 00:57:16,901
and I want you
to hurl them

1192
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:17,333
at her.

1193
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:19,168
To her face?!

1194
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:20,336
Yes.

1195
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:23,917
What?
Like "ugly?"

1196
00:57:24,017 --> 00:57:25,742
Precisely.

1197
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,842
Ugly, yes.

1198
00:57:30,679 --> 00:57:32,448
Ugly.

1199
00:57:32,548 --> 00:57:34,548
Scream it out!

1200
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:36,085
Ugly!

1201
00:57:36,185 --> 00:57:39,735
Stupid!
Cow!

1202
00:57:39,835 --> 00:57:41,256
Whore!
Sow!

1203
00:57:41,356 --> 00:57:43,980
Cross-eyed!
Monster!

1204
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,127
Cripple!

1205
00:57:45,227 --> 00:57:48,208
That's nine.
One more.

1206
00:57:48,308 --> 00:57:51,582
Idiot!!

1207
00:57:51,682 --> 00:57:54,148
Good. How is
she responding?

1208
00:57:54,248 --> 00:57:56,236
I love you.

1209
00:57:57,473 --> 00:57:59,475
Banish the tranquil idea
you've composed.

1210
00:57:59,575 --> 00:58:01,897
See Bertha as she
would be now

1211
00:58:01,997 --> 00:58:03,011
each morning,

1212
00:58:03,111 --> 00:58:06,695
Spasms, her arms
and legs in spasms,

1213
00:58:06,795 --> 00:58:08,435
Cross-eyed,
Mutant.

1214
00:58:08,535 --> 00:58:09,786
Hallucinating.

1215
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,120
Suffering!

1216
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:15,316
[screaming]

1217
00:58:24,233 --> 00:58:27,136
See her as the infant
she longs to revert to.

1218
00:58:27,236 --> 00:58:29,864
[rattle and giggling]

1219
00:58:36,144 --> 00:58:38,681
See her as an adult,
sitting on the toilet

1220
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:41,031
as she does
each day,

1221
00:58:41,131 --> 00:58:44,335
Ooh.
Hi, Josef.

1222
00:58:44,435 --> 00:58:45,988
[farts]

1223
00:58:46,088 --> 00:58:47,866
If you are alone
and you begin

1224
00:58:47,966 --> 00:58:48,924
to think of her,

1225
00:58:49,024 --> 00:58:50,862
tell her "Go away,
I hate you!" as

1226
00:58:50,962 --> 00:58:51,828
loud as you can.

1227
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,347
You pinch yourself
as hard as you can!

1228
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:54,864
Say it!

1229
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:56,131
Go away!

1230
00:58:56,231 --> 00:58:58,758
Pinch yourself!
Pinch yourself!

1231
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:00,061
Pinch yourself
as hard as

1232
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:00,536
you can!

1233
00:59:00,636 --> 00:59:02,104
Go away!
I hate you!

1234
00:59:02,204 --> 00:59:03,405
Listen. If you're
ever alone

1235
00:59:03,505 --> 00:59:05,408
and you begin to think
about her, shout

1236
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,855
"Go away, I hate you"
as loud as you can.

1237
00:59:07,955 --> 00:59:09,044
Say it. I hate you.

1238
00:59:09,144 --> 00:59:09,912
I hate you!!

1239
00:59:10,012 --> 00:59:10,713
I hate you!

1240
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:11,480
I hate you!!

1241
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:12,281
I hate you!

1242
00:59:12,381 --> 00:59:13,583
I hate you!!

1243
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:15,258
Louder!
Say it.

1244
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:16,552
I hate you,

1245
00:59:16,652 --> 00:59:19,349
Say it! Josef, if you are
ever alone, you begin

1246
00:59:19,449 --> 00:59:20,355
to think of her,

1247
00:59:20,455 --> 00:59:22,430
you shout "Go away,
I hate you" as loud

1248
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:23,493
as you can. Say it.

1249
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:25,561
As loud as you can.
Say it. I hate you.

1250
00:59:25,661 --> 00:59:28,209
Go--away!!
I hate you!!

1251
00:59:28,309 --> 00:59:30,098
I love you,

1252
00:59:30,198 --> 00:59:31,508
(Breuer)
Go away!

1253
00:59:31,608 --> 00:59:33,608
I hate you!

1254
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:45,211
What are
we waiting

1255
00:59:45,311 --> 00:59:46,114
for, Fishman?

1256
00:59:46,214 --> 00:59:48,214
(fishman)
Yeah, ho!

1257
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:25,502
Hm.

1258
01:00:25,602 --> 01:00:29,008
Your heart
is strong.

1259
01:00:29,108 --> 01:00:30,401
But mine
is close

1260
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,501
to bursting.

1261
01:00:34,029 --> 01:00:36,268
After yesterday,
I feel like a bear

1262
01:00:36,368 --> 01:00:37,867
being trained to dance,

1263
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:41,587
It's true.
I've lowered you.

1264
01:00:41,687 --> 01:00:43,105
And myself.

1265
01:00:43,205 --> 01:00:45,104
And a teacher
should be

1266
01:00:45,204 --> 01:00:46,542
a raiser of men.

1267
01:00:46,642 --> 01:00:48,277
We are
missing something.

1268
01:00:48,377 --> 01:00:51,157
Yes, we've neglected
to understand

1269
01:00:51,257 --> 01:00:52,080
the meaning

1270
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,998
behind your obsession.

1271
01:00:55,098 --> 01:00:56,310
How can we
discover the

1272
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:57,520
meaning of something

1273
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,556
that I myself
have concealed?

1274
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,147
By talking
about it.

1275
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,977
What would your
life be if there

1276
01:01:05,077 --> 01:01:05,961
was no Bertha?

1277
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:10,279
Life without Bertha--

1278
01:01:10,379 --> 01:01:12,386
would be
a colorless one.

1279
01:01:12,486 --> 01:01:13,902
Everything would
be decided.

1280
01:01:14,002 --> 01:01:18,620
This medical bag,
these black clothes.

1281
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,318
I'm a scientist.
Yet science has

1282
01:01:21,418 --> 01:01:22,077
no color.

1283
01:01:22,177 --> 01:01:25,794
I need passion!

1284
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:27,882
I need magic!

1285
01:01:30,285 --> 01:01:32,738
That's what
Bertha represents.

1286
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:36,404
Life without passion,
without mystery?

1287
01:01:36,504 --> 01:01:40,257
Who can live
such a life?

1288
01:01:43,265 --> 01:01:45,265
But he is
expecting me.

1289
01:01:48,303 --> 01:01:52,253
You're lured to mystery.
You're lured to danger.

1290
01:01:52,353 --> 01:01:54,422
But I hate danger.

1291
01:01:54,522 --> 01:01:57,091
I live my
life safely.

1292
01:01:57,191 --> 01:01:59,281
Living safely
is what's dangerous.

1293
01:01:59,381 --> 01:02:02,930
Living safely
is dangerous?

1294
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:05,127
Nietzsche, there is
no Professor

1295
01:02:05,227 --> 01:02:06,221
Nietzsche here.

1296
01:02:06,321 --> 01:02:07,522
Check again.

1297
01:02:07,622 --> 01:02:09,272
There is
no Professor

1298
01:02:09,372 --> 01:02:11,372
Nietzsche here.

1299
01:02:24,306 --> 01:02:26,579
Perhaps Bertha
represents my

1300
01:02:26,679 --> 01:02:27,943
desire to escape

1301
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:31,013
my deadly safe life,
the trap of time.

1302
01:02:31,113 --> 01:02:33,662
Time is our
burden, Josef.

1303
01:02:33,762 --> 01:02:36,700
The greatest challenge
is to live in

1304
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,775
spite of it.

1305
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:55,470
I hate women
with lips.

1306
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:57,272
Why do you
show me this?

1307
01:02:57,372 --> 01:02:59,740
Because she has
a combination

1308
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,443
of lips,

1309
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:04,395
eyes and breasts--

1310
01:03:04,495 --> 01:03:07,709
that give her almost
superhuman powers.

1311
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,498
Powers to
do what?

1312
01:03:11,598 --> 01:03:13,355
When I'm
with her,

1313
01:03:13,455 --> 01:03:17,008
I feel that
I'm in the center

1314
01:03:17,108 --> 01:03:18,828
of an orderly,

1315
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:23,112
tranquil universe.

1316
01:03:23,212 --> 01:03:26,179
An intensely
beautiful place

1317
01:03:26,279 --> 01:03:29,045
where there
are no questions

1318
01:03:29,145 --> 01:03:31,386
about life or purpose.

1319
01:03:31,486 --> 01:03:33,473
Like walking
on clouds.

1320
01:03:37,145 --> 01:03:39,610
Where do your
thoughts go now?

1321
01:03:50,292 --> 01:03:54,145
Her eyes--
they glisten,

1322
01:03:54,245 --> 01:03:55,997
She doesn't speak,

1323
01:03:56,097 --> 01:03:57,667
yet she talks
to me.

1324
01:03:57,767 --> 01:03:59,334
And what does
she say?

1325
01:03:59,434 --> 01:04:01,434
She says--

1326
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:04,239
"Josef,

1327
01:04:04,339 --> 01:04:07,740
you are adorable."

1328
01:04:11,313 --> 01:04:14,264
And in
that moment,

1329
01:04:14,364 --> 01:04:16,364
I am.

1330
01:04:20,222 --> 01:04:22,592
When she told me
one day that she

1331
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,138
dreamed of us
making love,

1332
01:04:25,238 --> 01:04:26,662
I was ecstatic.

1333
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:28,787
What a victory,

1334
01:04:30,498 --> 01:04:33,983
To enter a place
where no man

1335
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:36,083
has ever been.

1336
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:48,495
Have you ever known
a Bertha, Frederich?

1337
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:53,687
friedrich,

1338
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:00,050
I once knew
a woman who could

1339
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:02,150
not be denied. Yes.

1340
01:05:04,165 --> 01:05:06,630
Tell me more
about this woman.

1341
01:05:18,213 --> 01:05:20,213
What was
her name?

1342
01:05:23,451 --> 01:05:25,451
Do you still
love her?

1343
01:05:30,058 --> 01:05:32,693
We are more
in love with desire,

1344
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,911
than the desired.

1347
01:06:41,508 --> 01:06:43,064
These sessions
with Nietzsche

1348
01:06:43,164 --> 01:06:44,899
have become
the center

1349
01:06:44,999 --> 01:06:46,999
of my day.

1350
01:06:47,769 --> 01:06:49,769
Why?

1351
01:06:50,438 --> 01:06:52,478
The relief
of disclosure.

1352
01:06:53,608 --> 01:06:55,845
Perhaps in 5O years
this talking cure

1353
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:59,005
might develop into
a precise science.

1354
01:07:01,383 --> 01:07:03,190
I thought
I could

1355
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:04,252
help him.

1356
01:07:04,352 --> 01:07:05,521
No longer.

1357
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:08,086
He has everything
to offer me.

1358
01:07:09,357 --> 01:07:11,083
I'm wondering
if part of this

Shh.

1363
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:21,852

be to live as

1365

name was Bertha?

I love Bertha

This grave opens,

1435
01:12:15,776 --> 01:12:18,312
and my father
rises up,

1436
01:12:18,412 --> 01:12:20,650
and he runs
to this church.

1437
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:22,470
It's where
he preached,

1438
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:26,924
And he grabbed
this small child,

1439
01:12:27,024 --> 01:12:30,558
and he climbed back--

1440
01:12:30,658 --> 01:12:31,913
into the grave,

1441
01:12:32,013 --> 01:12:34,249
I always believed
that this dream

1442
01:12:34,349 --> 01:12:36,050
predicted my
brother's death, but

1443
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:38,867
I suspect it
was my own--

1444
01:12:38,967 --> 01:12:40,954

own fear.

1445
01:12:43,391 --> 01:12:44,959

I don't remember.

01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:06,010
Who is the one
who stops you

from falling

1455
01:13:07,115 --> 01:13:09,115

01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:16,923
Or perhaps
your mother?

1459
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:24,865

Who is inside
the coffin?

1461
01:13:36,411 --> 01:13:39,278
I can still
see her face.

1462
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,998
She's smiling
at me.

1463
01:13:44,098 --> 01:13:46,085
Hm.

1464
01:13:47,088 --> 01:13:49,088

1465
01:13:58,032 --> 01:14:00,899
How could she
leave me?

[trembling breaths]

1467
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:13,811
I never really
let her go.

1468
01:14:17,618 --> 01:14:21,078
Perhaps adult figures
enter a child's mind

1469
01:14:21,178 --> 01:14:23,153
and refuse to leave.

1470
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:32,244
But you must be
as frightened as

1471
01:14:32,344 --> 01:14:33,534
I am of death--

1472
01:14:33,634 --> 01:14:35,634
and godlessness.

1473
01:14:38,406 --> 01:14:41,087
We must die.
But at the

1474
01:14:41,187 --> 01:14:42,477
right time.

1475
01:14:42,577 --> 01:14:44,977
Death only loses
its terror when

1476

one has

1477
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,194
consummated one's life.

consummated

1480
01:14:51,252 --> 01:14:54,138
I have achieved
a great deal.

1481
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:55,557
But have you
lived your life?

1482
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,987
Or have you
been lived

1483
01:14:58,087 --> 01:14:58,693
by it?

1484
01:14:58,793 --> 01:15:02,911
You stand outside
your life, grieving,

1485
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:07,515
for some life
that you--

my life!

1488
01:15:11,455 --> 01:15:15,292
I have my family,
my patients!

1489
01:15:15,392 --> 01:15:18,492
Students.

1490
01:15:18,592 --> 01:15:19,848
It's too late.

1491
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:21,375
I cannot tell
you how to

1492
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:22,517
live differently.

1493
01:15:22,617 --> 01:15:24,040
If I did,
you'd still be living

1494
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,219
by some other's design,

1495
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:27,291
but perhaps
I could give you

1496
01:15:27,391 --> 01:15:28,389
a gift, Josef.

1497
01:15:28,489 --> 01:15:31,707
Maybe I could give
you a thought.

1498
01:15:31,807 --> 01:15:34,095
What if some demon
were to say to you

1499
01:15:34,195 --> 01:15:37,879
that this life,
as you now live it,

1500
01:15:37,979 --> 01:15:39,934
have lived it
in the past,

1501
01:15:40,034 --> 01:15:43,982
you would have to live
once more but--

1502
01:15:44,082 --> 01:15:46,490
innumerable times more.

1503
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:49,633
There will
be nothing

1504
01:15:49,733 --> 01:15:51,212
new in it.

1505
01:15:51,312 --> 01:15:54,520
Every pain, every joy,
every unutterably small

1506
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:55,584
or great thing

1507
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:58,901
in your life would
just return to you.

1508
01:15:59,001 --> 01:16:02,339
The same succession,
the same sequence,

1509
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:03,792
again and again,

1510
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:06,108
like an hourglass
of time.

1511
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:09,377
Imagine infinity.

1512
01:16:09,477 --> 01:16:13,255
Consider the possibility
that every action

1513
01:16:13,355 --> 01:16:14,969
you choose, Josef,

1514
01:16:15,069 --> 01:16:20,086
you choose
for all time.

1515
01:16:20,186 --> 01:16:25,563
Then all--unlived life

1516
01:16:25,663 --> 01:16:29,708
would remain--
inside you.

1517
01:16:32,286 --> 01:16:35,619
Unlived,
Throughout eternity,

1518
01:16:38,292 --> 01:16:40,474
You like
this idea?

1519
01:16:40,574 --> 01:16:41,841
Do you
hate it?

1520
01:16:41,941 --> 01:16:42,430
Which?

1521
01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:43,931
I hate it!

1522
01:16:44,031 --> 01:16:45,667
Why?

1523
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:51,352
The only thing
I love about my life

1524
01:16:51,452 --> 01:16:56,124
is the thought

1525
01:16:56,224 --> 01:16:59,670
that I have fulfilled
my duties to my wife

1526
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:00,749
and children.

1527
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:04,865
Duty?

1528
01:17:04,965 --> 01:17:06,254
Your duty
is a sham.

1529
01:17:06,354 --> 01:17:09,706
It's the curtain
you hide behind.

1530
01:17:09,806 --> 01:17:12,305
To truly build
your children,

1531
01:17:12,405 --> 01:17:16,178
you build
yourself. First.

1532
01:17:16,278 --> 01:17:18,774
And as for your wife,
let her break out from

1533
01:17:18,874 --> 01:17:20,134
this prison you share.

1534
01:17:20,234 --> 01:17:21,536
And be
broken by it.

1535
01:17:21,636 --> 01:17:23,636
Hm?

1536
01:17:25,373 --> 01:17:26,856
(Sigmund)
Are you sure

1537
01:17:26,956 --> 01:17:27,709
about this?

1538
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:30,149
To continue
with the sense

1539
01:17:30,249 --> 01:17:32,292
that I have not lived.

1540
01:17:32,392 --> 01:17:36,817
That I have not
tasted freedom.

1541
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,285
The idea fills
me with horror.

1542
01:17:50,164 --> 01:17:52,164
Help me, Siggy.

1543
01:18:11,152 --> 01:18:13,279
Fly! Fly!

1544
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,151
Fly!
You're free!

1545
01:18:17,251 --> 01:18:19,251
You're free!

1546
01:18:21,495 --> 01:18:23,495
And you too
are free.

1547
01:18:31,338 --> 01:18:32,841
(Mathilde)
free them?

1548
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:34,743
This is madness,

1549
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:37,276
Suddenly I find
that I am old.

1550
01:18:37,376 --> 01:18:39,317
I am facing death
without having

1551
01:18:39,417 --> 01:18:40,281
lived my life!

1552
01:18:40,381 --> 01:18:42,867
Since when is there
your life and

1553
01:18:42,967 --> 01:18:43,551
my life?

1554
01:18:43,651 --> 01:18:46,796
We made a covenant
to share our lives.

1555
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:51,359
Leave if you want!

1556
01:18:51,459 --> 01:18:54,106
But not until I tell
you about the cruel

1557
01:18:54,206 --> 01:18:55,262
joke of freedom.

1558
01:18:55,362 --> 01:18:57,544
I wish I had
your freedom.

1559
01:18:57,644 --> 01:18:59,184
Freedom of a man
to obtain

1560
01:18:59,284 --> 01:19:00,067
an education.

1561
01:19:00,167 --> 01:19:01,936
To choose
a profession.

1562
01:19:02,036 --> 01:19:03,463
I wish I had
the vocabulary,

1563
01:19:03,563 --> 01:19:04,005
the logic

1564
01:19:04,105 --> 01:19:06,079
to express
just how foolish

1565
01:19:06,179 --> 01:19:06,907
you sound!

1566
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:09,034
Mathilde, if I
am able to

1567
01:19:09,134 --> 01:19:10,077
find my life

1568
01:19:10,177 --> 01:19:11,946
we will both
be better off.

1569
01:19:12,046 --> 01:19:13,403
Perhaps I will
come back

1570
01:19:13,503 --> 01:19:14,248
to this life.

1571
01:19:14,348 --> 01:19:16,117
But it must be
my choice!

1572
01:19:16,217 --> 01:19:18,463
Have you forgotten
about the choice you

1573
01:19:18,563 --> 01:19:19,721
made in marrying me?

1574
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:21,694
What choices
does a deserted

1575
01:19:21,794 --> 01:19:22,456
wife have?

1576
01:19:22,556 --> 01:19:25,408
You are young,
rich, attractive!

1577
01:19:25,508 --> 01:19:26,436
You will be
as free

1578
01:19:26,536 --> 01:19:26,927
as I am!

1579
01:19:27,027 --> 01:19:28,797
We have
three children!

1580
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:32,772
Mathilde, I should
have been I before

1581
01:19:32,872 --> 01:19:34,101
I became we!

1582
01:19:34,201 --> 01:19:36,872
Words! Words!
You cannot live

1583
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:37,773
in words!

1584
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:41,557
I choose
my life, too.

1585
01:19:41,657 --> 01:19:42,844
And I choose
to tell you

1586
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:45,762
you cannot return
to this house

1587
01:19:45,862 --> 01:19:47,988
because it will
no longer be

1588
01:19:48,088 --> 01:19:48,850
your home!

1589
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:52,843
Once you leave,
I will no longer

1590
01:19:52,943 --> 01:19:54,523
be your wife!

1591
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,682
Mama!

1592
01:20:00,194 --> 01:20:01,681
Say goodbye
to your father,

1593
01:20:01,781 --> 01:20:02,263
children.

1594
01:20:02,363 --> 01:20:04,478
Forever.

1595
01:20:04,578 --> 01:20:07,214
Please, Papa,
don't leave.

1596
01:20:07,314 --> 01:20:11,397
[weeping]

1597
01:20:16,477 --> 01:20:18,703
Get out there.
Leave, if that's

1598
01:20:18,803 --> 01:20:19,815
what you want.

1599
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:22,530
Robert, I'm still
your father.

1600
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:26,108
No, you're not
my father anymore.

1601
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:31,290
Robert.

1602
01:20:48,409 --> 01:20:50,900
Goodbye, my
little chickens.

1603
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I only have
one life!

1604
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:12,727
(Breuer)
Nietzsche is right.

1605
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:17,777
My freedom has been here
all along for the taking.

1606
01:22:17,877 --> 01:22:20,819
Now is my last chance,

1607
01:22:20,919 --> 01:22:24,985
This is my one
and only life.

1608
01:22:25,085 --> 01:22:27,441
I'm looking for
Bertha Pappenheim,

1609
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:29,510
She's in the garden
with the doctor.

1610
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:31,813
Should I inform her
you are here?

1611
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:34,264
No, thank you,
I shall wait.

1612
01:22:34,364 --> 01:22:36,283
Please, wait for
her upstairs.

1613
01:22:36,383 --> 01:22:38,383
Thank you.

1614
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:37,977
I love you.

1615
01:23:42,516 --> 01:23:45,296
You will always be
the only man in

1616
01:23:45,396 --> 01:23:47,371
my life.

1617
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:58,191
Josef!
How are you?

1618
01:24:22,056 --> 01:24:24,056
Papa, don't leave,

1619
01:24:26,326 --> 01:24:28,395
(Nietzsche)
Having doubts, Josef?

1620
01:24:28,495 --> 01:24:29,626
How could I
have given

1621
01:24:29,726 --> 01:24:30,464
up everything?

1622
01:24:30,564 --> 01:24:32,099
You'd given up
everything long

1623
01:24:32,199 --> 01:24:33,133
before you met me.

1624
01:24:33,233 --> 01:24:35,883
Yes, but now
I have nothing!

1625
01:24:35,983 --> 01:24:37,706
And nothing
is everything.

1626
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:39,752
In order to grow
strong, you

1627
01:24:39,852 --> 01:24:40,541
must first

1628
01:24:40,641 --> 01:24:43,644
sink your roots deep
into nothingness,

1629
01:24:43,744 --> 01:24:45,992
But learn to
face your

1630
01:24:46,092 --> 01:24:48,328
loneliest loneliness,

1631
01:24:48,428 --> 01:24:51,368
[weeping]
My wife.

1632
01:24:51,468 --> 01:24:52,553
My children.

1633
01:24:52,653 --> 01:24:55,038
How could I
have left them?

1634
01:24:55,138 --> 01:24:57,555
You must be ready
to burn yourself

1635
01:24:57,655 --> 01:24:58,959
in your own flame,

1636
01:24:59,059 --> 01:25:01,140
How could you
become new,

1637
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:04,925
if you would not
first become ashes?

1638
01:26:24,645 --> 01:26:26,645
Waiter.

1639
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:31,734
Josef?

1640
01:26:31,834 --> 01:26:33,818
Dr. Breuer?

1641
01:26:35,689 --> 01:26:37,689
Josef!

1642
01:26:38,392 --> 01:26:39,594
Where are
you going?!

1643
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:41,741
What a ridiculous man.

1644
01:26:41,841 --> 01:26:44,821
(Sigmund)
Josef, come back?

1645
01:26:58,145 --> 01:27:00,145
Josef!

1646
01:27:04,418 --> 01:27:06,418
Josef!
Look out!

1647
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:13,227
Josef!

1648
01:27:13,327 --> 01:27:15,327
Josef!
Come back!

1649
01:27:19,132 --> 01:27:21,132
Josef!

1650
01:27:21,468 --> 01:27:23,468
Josef!

1651
01:27:35,382 --> 01:27:38,301
Josef, listen
to me.

1652
01:27:38,401 --> 01:27:39,821
[choking]

1653
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:41,555
Eight,

1654
01:27:41,655 --> 01:27:43,056
Seven,

1655
01:27:43,156 --> 01:27:44,491
Six,

1656
01:27:44,591 --> 01:27:45,760
five,

1657
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:47,161
four,

1658
01:27:47,261 --> 01:27:49,261
three,

1659
01:27:51,064 --> 01:27:52,466
One,

1660
01:27:52,566 --> 01:27:53,768
[gasping]

1661
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:55,502
You're wide
awake now.

1662
01:27:55,602 --> 01:27:57,684
Where am I?

1663
01:27:57,784 --> 01:27:58,773
Where am I?

1664
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:01,291
Everything's alright,
Josef.

1665
01:28:01,391 --> 01:28:04,356
Siggy--

1666
01:28:04,456 --> 01:28:07,363
what's happening
to me?

1667
01:28:07,463 --> 01:28:10,400
You are in
your house.

1668
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,768
It'll all come
back to you.

1669
01:28:12,868 --> 01:28:15,055
I did exactly
as you instructed.

1670
01:28:15,155 --> 01:28:16,962
I hypnotized you
using your watch

1671
01:28:17,062 --> 01:28:17,825
as a pendulum.

1672
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:21,986
Here it is, Josef,
on your desk.

1673
01:28:30,370 --> 01:28:34,033
Yes.
Yes.

1674
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:43,367
Yes, I remember.

1675
01:28:43,467 --> 01:28:45,052
How long
was I under?

1676
01:28:45,152 --> 01:28:47,152
Nearly an hour.

1677
01:28:48,121 --> 01:28:52,542
You wept,
you looked frightened,

1678
01:28:52,642 --> 01:28:53,853
I asked you
if you wanted

1679
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:54,328
to stop,

1680
01:28:54,428 --> 01:28:56,428
[gasps]

1681
01:29:00,734 --> 01:29:02,883
Now I know
what it would

1682
01:29:02,983 --> 01:29:03,771
be like--

1683
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:06,396
to live differently.

1684
01:29:11,578 --> 01:29:13,763
Max and Rachel
have arrived

1685
01:29:13,863 --> 01:29:15,649
for dinner.

1686
01:29:15,749 --> 01:29:17,749
Mathilde.

1687
01:29:19,086 --> 01:29:21,401
You complain
you don't see

1688
01:29:21,501 --> 01:29:22,656
enough of me.

1689
01:29:22,756 --> 01:29:24,938
Yet, when
I'm here,

1690
01:29:25,038 --> 01:29:27,025
you want
to desert me?

1691
01:29:37,637 --> 01:29:39,637
I've been
away, my dear.

1692
01:29:41,208 --> 01:29:43,301
But now
I am back.

1693
01:29:45,011 --> 01:29:47,011
I'm glad
you're here.

1694
01:29:49,082 --> 01:29:50,742
Dr. Freud,
my husband

1695
01:29:50,842 --> 01:29:52,842
needs a doctor.

1696
01:29:58,358 --> 01:29:59,694
To your health,
my boy.

1697
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:01,361
And to you, Max.

1698
01:30:01,461 --> 01:30:02,543
(Max)
And to

1699
01:30:02,643 --> 01:30:03,697
you, Josef.

1700
01:30:03,797 --> 01:30:06,857
Cheers.

1701
01:30:18,412 --> 01:30:19,246
Oh!

1702
01:30:19,346 --> 01:30:21,940
[whistle and chuckle]

1703
01:30:23,717 --> 01:30:25,118
Mmm.

1704
01:30:25,218 --> 01:30:27,743
My boy, my boy.

1705
01:30:35,662 --> 01:30:37,662
Excuse me.

1706
01:30:41,802 --> 01:30:44,965
[trembling breaths]

1707
01:30:54,648 --> 01:30:56,648
[breathes in
sharply]

1708
01:31:08,295 --> 01:31:11,310
Have I made
you cry?

1709
01:31:11,410 --> 01:31:15,380
It's a good cry.
It's sad too.

1710
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:19,221
When I think
how long it's been-

1711
01:31:19,321 --> 01:31:22,889
Marry me, Mathilde.
Please.

1712
01:31:22,989 --> 01:31:27,128
I think we did this
15 years ago.

1713
01:31:27,228 --> 01:31:30,499
And I choose
to do it again.

1714
01:31:30,599 --> 01:31:33,166
Today.

1715
01:31:33,266 --> 01:31:35,635
And every day
for the rest

1716
01:31:35,735 --> 01:31:37,735
of our lives.

1717
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:45,718
(Nietzsche)
So, tell me, how

1718
01:31:45,818 --> 01:31:47,300
did you cast her out?

1719
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:51,219
Well, I was terrified
by aging and death.

1720
01:31:51,319 --> 01:31:53,385
I fought back
but blindly.

1721
01:31:53,485 --> 01:31:56,258
In desperation,
I attacked my wife

1722
01:31:56,358 --> 01:31:58,378
and sought rescue
in the arms of one

1723
01:31:58,478 --> 01:31:59,788
who had
no rescue

1724
01:31:59,888 --> 01:32:01,888
to give!

1725
01:32:02,148 --> 01:32:05,298
In a certain sense,
I've betrayed you,

1726
01:32:05,398 --> 01:32:07,583
I have been
so dishonest

1727
01:32:07,683 --> 01:32:08,488
with you.

1728
01:32:08,588 --> 01:32:11,271
Completely.

1729
01:32:11,371 --> 01:32:13,163
I was
myself involved

1730
01:32:13,263 --> 01:32:14,394
with a woman.

1731
01:32:14,494 --> 01:32:18,144
A few months ago.

1732
01:32:18,244 --> 01:32:19,332
Her name
was Lou.

1733
01:32:19,432 --> 01:32:22,351
Not so unlike
your Bertha.

1734
01:32:22,451 --> 01:32:24,460
Beautiful girl.

1735
01:32:26,606 --> 01:32:30,087
I fell in love.

1736
01:32:30,187 --> 01:32:34,226
She just appeared
to be my twin brain.

1737
01:32:34,326 --> 01:32:36,509
My soul's mate,

1738
01:32:37,952 --> 01:32:39,554
And she led me
on to believe

1739
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:42,434
that I was the man
to whom she was

1740
01:32:42,534 --> 01:32:44,467
destined and--

1741
01:32:44,567 --> 01:32:45,760
I believed her,

1742
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:48,908
And when I offered
myself to her,

1743
01:32:49,008 --> 01:32:51,814
she spurned me--

1744
01:32:51,914 --> 01:32:56,184
in favor of
my best friend--

1745
01:32:56,284 --> 01:32:57,805
in the world.

1746
01:32:57,905 --> 01:32:59,774
[thunder]

1747
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:02,901
I must tell you
that there

1748
01:33:03,001 --> 01:33:03,910
is not--

1749
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:08,661
not one day
that goes by--

1750
01:33:08,761 --> 01:33:10,748
not even an hour,

1751
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:13,958
where I do
not think

1752
01:33:14,058 --> 01:33:16,058
of that woman.

1753
01:33:16,723 --> 01:33:18,291
She is your Bertha.

1754
01:33:18,391 --> 01:33:20,087
But you see?
You've been doing

1755
01:33:20,187 --> 01:33:21,161
double work here.

1756
01:33:21,261 --> 01:33:23,229
Yours and mine.

1757
01:33:23,329 --> 01:33:25,600
I'm like the most
cowardly of women.

1758
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:28,001
And I crouch behind
your back here,

1759
01:33:28,101 --> 01:33:31,526
letting you face
all the dangers

1760
01:33:31,626 --> 01:33:32,672
all alone.

1761
01:33:32,772 --> 01:33:35,421
You have courage.

1762
01:33:35,521 --> 01:33:38,987
Friedrich, there is
something I must

1763
01:33:39,087 --> 01:33:39,913
tell you.

1764
01:33:40,013 --> 01:33:40,848
Dr. Breuer?

1765
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:42,349
How do you do?

1766
01:33:42,449 --> 01:33:44,501
You must read these
letters Nietzsche

1767
01:33:44,601 --> 01:33:45,252
has sent me.

1768
01:33:45,352 --> 01:33:47,833
These are
my private letters.

1769
01:33:47,933 --> 01:33:49,122
You did see
her then?

1770
01:33:49,222 --> 01:33:50,758
Yes, but I
refused her.

1771
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:51,921
So all of this
was just

1772
01:33:52,021 --> 01:33:52,527
a pretense.

1773
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:55,078
I made a promise
to help you.

1774
01:33:55,178 --> 01:33:56,664
I never betrayed
that promise.

1775
01:33:56,764 --> 01:33:59,119
What did she do?
She took you

1776
01:33:59,219 --> 01:34:00,400
by the arm?

1777
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,940
Told you she had
to spend more

1778
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,015
time with you?

1779
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:10,796
I shared one,
one holy moment

1780
01:34:10,896 --> 01:34:11,511
with her,

1781
01:34:11,611 --> 01:34:12,963
it's the only
holy moment

1782
01:34:13,063 --> 01:34:13,947
I've ever known.

1783
01:34:14,047 --> 01:34:15,795
No one fell
in love with

1784
01:34:15,895 --> 01:34:17,017
me, ever. Ever.

1785
01:34:17,117 --> 01:34:20,868
Friedrich, it may
have been a holy

1786
01:34:20,968 --> 01:34:22,622
moment for you,

1787
01:34:22,722 --> 01:34:24,722
but not for her.

1788
01:34:25,726 --> 01:34:26,894
What are
you saying?

1789
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:29,724
She never mentioned
the water?

1790
01:34:30,563 --> 01:34:32,563
No.

1791
01:34:41,508 --> 01:34:43,276
I feel such
a loss.

1792
01:34:43,376 --> 01:34:45,376
Hm.

1793
01:34:56,957 --> 01:34:58,058
I don't know.

1794
01:34:58,158 --> 01:35:00,558
I think I've
lost Lou.

1795
01:35:03,029 --> 01:35:05,029
And you.

1796
01:35:07,033 --> 01:35:09,919
Everything, I lose.

1797
01:35:10,019 --> 01:35:11,699
I could have
[indistinct]

1798
01:35:11,799 --> 01:35:12,840
from your mind.

1799
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:14,274
And you
have a family.

1800
01:35:14,374 --> 01:35:17,046
You have your family
and I have

1801
01:35:17,146 --> 01:35:18,244
my pretenses.

1802
01:35:18,344 --> 01:35:21,233
My secret little
ways of tolerating

1803
01:35:21,333 --> 01:35:22,382
my aloneness.

1804
01:35:22,482 --> 01:35:24,607
But I glorify it,
don't I?

1805
01:35:26,619 --> 01:35:30,669
And I just don't
want to die alone.

1806
01:35:30,769 --> 01:35:34,328
I don't want my body
just to be discovered.

1807
01:35:35,228 --> 01:35:37,228
By its stench.

1808
01:35:38,999 --> 01:35:44,421
Lou softened that fear
for me for a while.

1809
01:35:44,521 --> 01:35:49,425
But you're right.

1810
01:35:49,525 --> 01:35:51,477
It's just
an illusion.

1811
01:35:51,577 --> 01:35:53,544
Friedrich.

1812
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:57,030
It's such
an illusion.

1813
01:35:57,130 --> 01:35:59,247
friedrich,
She does care

1814
01:35:59,347 --> 01:36:01,347
about you,

1815
01:36:02,522 --> 01:36:04,087
She went
to extremes

1816
01:36:04,187 --> 01:36:06,187
to help you.

1817
01:36:08,662 --> 01:36:11,345
If your tears
had a voice,

1818
01:36:11,445 --> 01:36:13,431
what would they say?

1819
01:36:15,636 --> 01:36:17,103
I feel so ashamed.

1820
01:36:17,203 --> 01:36:19,203
Tell me.

1821
01:36:20,975 --> 01:36:22,039
My tears
would say

1822
01:36:22,139 --> 01:36:22,810
we're free.

1823
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:24,778
You never
let us out,

1824
01:36:24,878 --> 01:36:28,177
until Dr. Breuer
opened the gate.

1825
01:36:35,221 --> 01:36:36,556
And what about
the sadness

1826
01:36:36,656 --> 01:36:37,658
behind those tears?

1827
01:36:37,758 --> 01:36:42,679
It's not sadness.
It's such a relief.

1828
01:36:42,779 --> 01:36:44,763
It's such
a relief!

1829
01:36:47,367 --> 01:36:49,267
It's the first time
I'm revealing

1830
01:36:49,367 --> 01:36:50,170
my loneliness.

1831
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:53,454
It's melting.
It's melting away.

1832
01:36:53,554 --> 01:36:56,736
It's a paradox,
Isolation exists

1833
01:36:56,836 --> 01:36:58,836
only in isolation.

1834
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:03,162
Once shared,
it evaporates.

1835
01:37:03,262 --> 01:37:05,342
My dear friend.

1836
01:37:11,124 --> 01:37:17,345
We are friends.

1837
01:37:17,445 --> 01:37:19,430
I like saying that.

1838
01:37:23,536 --> 01:37:25,831
No one ever said
this to me.

1839
01:37:32,712 --> 01:37:34,712
I like it.

1840
01:37:37,450 --> 01:37:38,519
I like it.

1841
01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:41,053
We are friends.

1842
01:37:43,356 --> 01:37:44,324
Friedrich.

1843
01:37:44,424 --> 01:37:45,492
It's good.

1844
01:37:45,592 --> 01:37:47,543
Stay with us tonight.

1845
01:37:47,643 --> 01:37:49,333
Have supper
with me and

1846
01:37:49,433 --> 01:37:50,196
my family.

1847
01:37:50,296 --> 01:37:53,536
No, it would mean
to abandon

1848
01:37:53,636 --> 01:37:54,901
my mission.

1849
01:37:55,001 --> 01:37:56,311
It's time
we went

1850
01:37:56,411 --> 01:37:58,411
our ways.

1851
01:38:12,752 --> 01:38:15,137
"We'll have friends,
and have become

1852
01:38:15,237 --> 01:38:16,857
strangers to each other,

1853
01:38:16,957 --> 01:38:18,958
"This is as
it ought to be.

1854
01:38:19,058 --> 01:38:21,231
"We do not want either
to conceal or obscure

1855
01:38:21,331 --> 01:38:21,695
the fact

1856
01:38:21,795 --> 01:38:24,074
"as if we had
to be ashamed

1857
01:38:24,174 --> 01:38:24,631
of it.

1858
01:38:24,731 --> 01:38:27,657
We are two ships,
each of which has

1859
01:38:27,757 --> 01:38:29,883
its goal and its course."

1860
01:38:29,983 --> 01:38:32,984
And finally, Dr. Breuer,

1861
01:38:33,084 --> 01:38:36,009
"We have to become
strangers to one another

1862
01:38:36,109 --> 01:38:38,363
because it's the law
to which we

1863
01:38:38,463 --> 01:38:39,379
are subject."

1864
01:38:39,479 --> 01:38:42,432
Have a safe journey.

1865
01:38:42,532 --> 01:38:44,515
My dear friend.
