1
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:27,208
Wash your windows, lady?

2
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,973
I don't do windows.

3
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,402
<i>We have you surrounded.
Stay right where you are.</i>

4
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,241
<i>All units, code five.</i>

5
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,998
Fire a warning shot.

6
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,549
That's no woman.

7
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,002
In that case, kill her!

8
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:16,090
<i>Go back to the future,
you inhuman nymph from hell!</i>

9
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,120
Holy shit!

10
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,257
No, no, cut it! Cut it.

11
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,376
God, this is completely unusable.

12
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,217
You effects guys
are gonna be the death of me.

13
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,715
- Hal? Hal!
- Yeah, talk to me.

14
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,133
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to you, all right.

15
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,935
It might be a good idea
if the car blows up before it does that...

16
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,109
So I messed up. It happened. It's done.

17
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,437
- For God's sake.
- My God!

18
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,817
Turn that thing off

19
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,898
- before I have a stroke.
- All right. I'm trying.

20
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,283
Is it off or not?

21
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,201
It's off! I don't know why it's doing this!

22
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,782
How can it be moving if it's off?

23
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,078
- Will you please answer me?
- It must be interference.

24
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,407
- Please handle this!
- I don't know. I only push the buttons.

25
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,688
I can't get this thing to stop.

26
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,960
My life is passing before my eyes, Fingers.

27
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,457
What the hell are you doing, buddy?

28
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,756
That's a quarter million dollar
piece of equipment!

29
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:35,010
Wow. Oh, my God.
Rollie Tyler. Rollie, it's me.

30
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,009
It's me, Marty Evans!
I was the third on Chainsaw Santa.

31
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,180
What's brings you here?

32
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,016
Well, the kid likes to see
movies being made.

33
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,093
Mr. Tyler, I'm a great fan.

34
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,430
Fingers, clean up the cyborg, all right?

35
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,851
Rollie, I have got
this primo new project I'd love to...

36
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,777
Sorry, I'm not in this game anymore.

37
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,610
But I tell you what.
If you need any toys for your kids,

38
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,941
give us a ring.

39
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,369
Come on, Chris. By the way,
next time you hire a special effects bloke,

40
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,539
make sure he's got all his fingers.
That might help. Good night.

41
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,367
- That was great, Rollie.
- That was schlock, Chris.

42
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,952
Why don't you work for that guy?

43
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,912
Because I like living too much, that's why.

44
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,457
Hey! Could I have some help
a little bit here with this piece of junk?

45
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,799
Rollie?

46
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,919
Rollie, we'll be late.

47
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,346
Did you hear me?

48
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,890
Yeah, I hear you.

49
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,230
You're not even dressed!

50
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,689
You are always doing this.
You forgot, didn't you?

51
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,816
No. I didn't forget.

52
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,946
Now, here. Try this on.

53
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,368
Come on.

54
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,822
I had to bribe the maitre d'
to get this reservation.

55
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,491
Well, I'd have been happy to just go
around the corner to Mario's.

56
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,952
Well, it's not your birthday, it's mine.

57
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,745
- You have good legs, you know?
- Shut up.

58
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,501
I like your dress.

59
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:54,998
What is this thing?

60
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,964
There we are. A telemetry suit.

61
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,842
I would have preferred a Ralph Lauren.

62
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,381
What are you doing?

63
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,841
Turning you on.

64
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,018
What do I do now?

65
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,815
Whatever you like.

66
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,101
Rollie.

67
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,737
You like it?

68
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,443
This is amazing.

69
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,534
Kids are gonna love this.

70
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,911
Kids that can afford it.

71
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,041
Oh, yeah.
Your index finger operates his eyes.

72
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,384
You're gonna have to give
a name for this thing.

73
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,114
I thought I might call it Bluey.

74
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,050
Bluey?

75
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,848
Well, at home,
if you've got red hair, you're called Blue.

76
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,429
What if you have blue hair?

77
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,556
Probably Grandma.

78
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,646
Whoops! Not 100 percent effective.

79
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,734
I think you'll find a screwdriver
in your pocket there.

80
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,269
- Can you hand it to me?
- Yeah.

81
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,235
Thank you.

82
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,567
What have we got there?

83
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,784
Wait a minute.

84
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,449
Thank you, Blue.

85
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,874
- Thank you.
- You like it?

86
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,413
I love it.

87
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,081
Oh, Bluey loves it, too.

88
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,379
Let me turn him off.

89
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,714
There we go.

90
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,425
Now, can I get out of this thing?

91
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,760
Unless you want to go to
the restaurant like that.

92
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,095
UP We go.

93
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,345
Yeah?

94
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,604
<i>It's Mike.</i>

95
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,099
Come on up, Mike.

96
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:44,487
Chris, I told you a million times,
no choppers in the house.

97
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,113
I think I got the hang Of it, Rollie.

98
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,987
You're doing well.
Nice light touch, remember?

99
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,791
Chris, cut it out.
Your father's on his way up.

100
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,118
I'm all packed, Mom.

101
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,301
Hello?

102
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,971
- Hi, Dad!
- Hey, there he is.

103
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,222
Hi, Mike.

104
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,720
- Hi.
- What time do you have?

105
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,097
I'm sorry. I was working on something
on my own.

106
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,638
I got hung up.
How's it going, slugger, huh?

107
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,189
Look what I nabbed from
the captain's desk.

108
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,062
What do you think? Like it?

109
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,984
Rollie made me a Dick Tracy watch.

110
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,653
Not the same thing, Chris.

111
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,355
Your dad's has got a lot more range.

112
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,065
- Mike.
- How are you?

113
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,367
Well, at least it's real.

114
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,113
Can I use your phone?

115
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,623
Yeah. It's right there.

116
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,543
Chris, go get your things.

117
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,921
Costume party, huh?

118
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,044
You'd look good in this.

119
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,170
Brandon here.

120
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,087
Come on!

121
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,798
For Christ's sake, I just put in 15 hours.

122
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,018
Yeah, I'm heading in. All right.

123
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,346
Shit.

124
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,104
Mike, you promised.

125
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,432
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,109
I'll take him with me.
Hey, champ! Wanna go to work with me?

127
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,777
- Great!
- All right.

128
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,322
Bet you thought I forgot, huh?

129
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,402
Bye.

130
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,528
Bye.

131
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,199
Have a good time.

132
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,408
That guy's still in love with you.

133
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,870
No, he is not.
He just doesn't like you very much.

134
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,079
Well?

135
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,584
You know my middle name.

136
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,587
Hey, long time no see.

137
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,467
Okay, Chris.
Just make yourself at home over here.

138
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:34,764
All right? Stay out of trouble,
or I'll throw you in the cage.

139
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,269
- Mike?
- Yeah.

140
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,242
You play Scrabble?

141
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,910
I don't believe this, boss.

142
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,411
Look at all these unsolveds
and you want me to stake out a peeper?

143
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,246
For Christ's sake, give it to uniform.

144
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,166
We got a chance here
to prevent the crime from happening,

145
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,964
instead of cleaning up
the mess and pushing paper.

146
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:06,958
Who's the perp?

147
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,761
Did seven years
for cutting up a model in '82.

148
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:11,929
Take a look at this.

149
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,260
Oh, man.

150
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,763
When do we go?

151
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,397
- Yesterday.
- Typical.

152
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,860
You've waited up for us.
That's very nice of you.

153
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,198
I suppose a drink's
out of the question, is it?

154
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,745
Maybe one, before I get started.

155
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,934
Of course. You've got to grade
those midterms, haven't you?

156
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,123
Yup, they're due out on Monday.

157
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,475
Surprise, surprise.

158
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,974
That's so sweet.

159
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,154
Can't help yourself, can you?

160
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,487
A new gel. Bit smelly.

161
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,782
Make a wish.

162
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,125
What did you wish?

163
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,911
- I'm not gonna tell you.
- Go on, tell me.

164
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,588
No. 'Cause then it won't come true.

165
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,231
Mom!

166
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,360
Mike, what are you doing here?

167
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,943
Excuse me. I'm sorry. It's...

168
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,953
I got to talk to Rollie.

169
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,949
Yeah, sure.

170
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,871
Come here, Chris.

171
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,880
We want to bait a trap
for this slime bucket.

172
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,170
Make him think that the girl is alone
in the apartment,

173
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,839
except it won't be the girl, it'll be me.

174
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,097
That's where you come in.

175
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,050
What? You want me
to make you look like her?

176
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,093
Why not?

177
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,849
You need a miracle worker,
not an effects man.

178
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,605
My kid says you can create
any illusion you want to.

179
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,270
Listen, Mike,
you're talking to the wrong bloke.

180
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,897
Cop's work isn't my game.

181
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,736
You think I don't know
what went down a few years ago?

182
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,567
What do you mean?

183
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,111
Between you and your pal, Leo McCarthy?

184
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,577
Let's get one thing straight.
McCarthy and I were never pals.

185
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,833
The way I heard it,
he got kicked off the force

186
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,411
because of a case
he was involved in with you.

187
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,627
Looks to me, you guys did okay.

188
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:55,836
Maybe you also heard that the lady
I was living with at the time was killed.

189
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:56,919
This is a different thing, Rollie.

190
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,323
You'll be in and out of the place
before you break a sweat.

191
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,008
That's what they said the last time.

192
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,722
If there's one thing I've learned,

193
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,268
it's that nothing is as simple
as people say it is.

194
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,854
- You want a beer?
- No. No, I don't want a beer...

195
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,405
I'm asking you to work for the NYPD,
for Christ's sake.

196
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,032
It's a straight-up thing!

197
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,860
The only person I work for now is myself.

198
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,786
That way, I always know who to trust.

199
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,621
Sorry I can't help you, Mike.

200
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,786
All right. Let me ask you something.

201
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,830
If someone like this was coming after Kim,
what would you do?

202
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,201
Why not?

203
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,230
Hey, you degenerates.
Get out of here. Come on.

204
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,957
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

205
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,466
This is a new one. What do you think?

206
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,636
I'm truly flattered.

207
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,632
Okay? All right. Now.

208
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,515
The microphone is in the left breast.

209
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,767
You press here if you
want to talk to Silak.

210
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,143
Great, they talk.

211
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,819
And this is so you can hear Silak.
You put that in your ear.

212
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,024
Now?

213
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,406
And if you want to talk to me,
you use this watch.

214
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,154
On, off and I'll beep you.

215
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,205
- Right.
- Gotcha.

216
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,324
Here we go.

217
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,709
I don't know about this, Rollie.

218
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,005
Believe me, it'll work.

219
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,125
You're a knockout.

220
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,336
You want to come for a little drink...

221
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:07,879
Would you get out of here with that?

222
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,181
Just asking. Okay, now, Kylie.

223
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,054
Mike'll give you your cue,

224
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,227
and then you just do everything
that we've rehearsed.

225
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,519
You're not gonna be here?

226
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,601
In spirit.

227
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,858
Damn Silak!

228
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,651
You know, it'd be
a whole lot simpler, Rollie,

229
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,687
if you stuck around and worked this stuff.

230
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,114
Don't worry. I'll be keeping an eye on you.

231
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,899
What's that?

232
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,369
- Camera.
- You're kidding me.

233
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,280
Latest technology.

234
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,994
A little paranoid, huh?

235
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:39,248
If there's any problems,
I'll beep you on the watch.

236
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,084
My kid's right. You're all right.

237
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,508
I wish I could say the same about you.

238
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,885
<i>Mike, you read me?</i>

239
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,031
What's going on up there? Where's Tyler?

240
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,237
<i>He's leaving now.</i>

241
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,320
Mike? Mike, I'm telling you,

242
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:18,033
nothing goes down
until Tyler's ass is on the street.

243
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,202
<i>Roger, boss. I'm out.</i>

244
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,457
There he is.

245
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:23,056
Mike? Mike? Your man's on his way in.

246
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,022
Let's go.

247
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,329
McQuay? McQuay.

248
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,886
Santoni, you stay here.

249
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,018
Kill that bulb, will you?

250
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,117
Here we go.

251
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,536
All right.

252
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,490
Show time, Mikey. Play the cheap seats.

253
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,225
We got him.

254
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,235
What? What?

255
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,883
Good. Real good.

256
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,631
Get down and come on through.

257
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,221
Stay low, stay low. That's it, that's it.

258
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,141
Stay low. Great. You're doing good.

259
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,310
Come on. Come on. Let me help you up.

260
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,142
- How'd I do?
- You did great.

261
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,648
I'll put you in for a Tony.
Now it's my turn.

262
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:12,934
- Break a leg.
- Yeah.

263
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,649
- Bye.
<i>- Mike?</i>

264
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,576
Mike!

265
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,112
<i>What?</i>

266
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,830
<i>What's the matter, Rollie?</i>

267
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,159
There's too much smoke.
It's a shower, not a fire.

268
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,709
<i>Yeah, so? What to I do?</i>

269
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,587
Go to the panel at the back of the machine.

270
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:37,591
- Yeah?
- Turn the knob counterclockwise.

271
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,717
Gotcha.

272
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,765
<i>Wrong way, Mike.</i>

273
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,437
Something's wrong.

274
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:52,974
What's shaking, Mike?

275
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,232
<i>I'm taking care of it.</i>

276
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,360
We've lost him.

277
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:01,441
Shit.

278
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,437
Mike? Mike?

279
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,643
The man's coming your way.

280
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:38,232
And, Mikey, he's got a blade.

281
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,160
- How you doing?
- I'm still shaking.

282
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,579
No. Just relax. Everything's gonna be fine.

283
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,085
Hey, Rollie, dig this.
I'm a special effects man.

284
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,094
What do you think of that movie?

285
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:05,425
Come, Mike. Knock it off.

286
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,011
<i>- Mike?</i>
- All right, all right, keep your shirt on.

287
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,718
That's better.

288
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,602
<i>Okay, Rollie, I'm signing off now.</i>

289
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,225
<i>In 10 minutes, I'll buy you a drink.</i>

290
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,980
Mike, don't take the watch off. Mike!

291
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,940
Okay, big boy, come and get it.

292
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,845
Here he comes.

293
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,825
Too smoky. Too bloody smoky.

294
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,315
Glad you've got that gun.

295
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,999
Jesus Christ, Mike!

296
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:11,547
Kick it in!

297
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,091
Freeze, asshole!

298
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,221
No!

299
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,386
No!

300
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,939
McQuay, get on the air.
Tell them we got a 10-13, cop down.

301
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,986
Get her out of here. Get her out!

302
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,912
Hey!

303
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,578
Hey!

304
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,082
Hey!

305
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,077
Where is everybody, Silak?
The bastard got away.

306
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,284
What the hell are you talking about?
I just iced the son of a bitch.

307
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,794
No. No.

308
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,251
There was someone else in the room.

309
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,092
How do you know?
I saw you leave the building.

310
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,639
He was on the back stairs.

311
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,640
Now, wait a minute.
Hold it. Hold it. Now, listen.

312
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,642
There were only two people in here,

313
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,812
Mike and this piece of shit.

314
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,722
Now if you saw somebody
on the back stairs,

315
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,182
he didn't come out of this place.

316
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,860
Mike is dead.

317
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,446
Too much smoke, Tyler.

318
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,114
He got to Mike first.

319
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,499
Now, would you get in there
and shut off that goddamn machine?

320
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,498
Lieutenant, backup's here.
Wagon's on the way.

321
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,474
I brought the girl to her neighbor's.

322
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,676
What a mess.

323
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,025
Jesus, Mike.

324
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,315
Why did this have to happen?

325
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,199
Shit. Why did this have to happen?

326
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,411
Oh, Christ.

327
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,831
Tyler.

328
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,380
I think you'd better get home.

329
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,553
Mike's kid is gonna need you.

330
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,925
What about my gear?

331
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,222
I'll see it gets back to you.

332
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,188
Let's talk tomorrow.

333
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,076
Okay.

334
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,220
Come on.

335
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,400
- Hello.
- Leo, it's Rollie...

336
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,653
<i>This is Leo McCarthy.
I hope this machine's working.</i>

337
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:55,888
<i>Leave your name, your number,</i>

338
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,737
<i>- the time, a brief message.
- Come on. Come on.</i>

339
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,741
<i>I promise I'll get back to you. I promise.</i>

340
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,152
Leo, it's Rollie.

341
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,594
<i>Pick up if you're there, will you?</i>

342
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,577
All right, you know where I am.
I need your help.

343
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,080
Get in touch. I'm in trouble.

344
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:24,804
Hey, how'd it go?

345
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,186
There's been an accident.

346
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,244
Chris, you don't have to do this.

347
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,662
I want to.

348
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,877
Hey, take a look at this.

349
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,677
You got a problem reading or what?

350
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,178
It says, "Do not enter."

351
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,551
It also says, "Crime scene."

352
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,052
What the hell is going on here?

353
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,930
Are you family, lady?

354
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,682
I'm Mike's ex-wife and this is his son.

355
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,767
We just came here to pick up a few things.

356
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:14,691
Nothing's gonna leave here
without an okay from downtown.

357
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,853
What exactly are you looking for,
if you don't mind my asking?

358
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,693
It's just a routine search procedure,
Miss Brandon.

359
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,195
You got a problem,
you talk to headquarters.

360
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,743
This is routine?

361
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,536
Mike was a victim, not the suspect.

362
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,119
Or does somebody see this differently?

363
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,870
When an officer's killed
in the line of duty,

364
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,624
it is our job to secure the premises
and all department property.

365
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:35,920
I'm sure you understand that.

366
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:39,045
Yeah, I understand.
I understand that that is a lot of baloney.

367
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,297
I can't believe this!

368
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,468
These are mine.

369
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,592
Bad blood, bar...

370
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,803
I'm still playing with those.

371
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:54,390
"Becker." Now, what kind of game is that?

372
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,146
Come on. You can see it's the kid's disk.

373
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,568
M♪am, you cannot take that.

374
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,150
Be reasonable. The boy
just lost his father.

375
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,491
Kim?

376
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,455
On, God, Ray.

377
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,628
I'm sorry.

378
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,291
Your father was a good cop, Chris.

379
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,591
The best I ever knew.

380
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,588
I'm gonna make sure
that you get his gold shield.

381
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,600
I know he'd want you to have it, okay?

382
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,889
Thank you.

383
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:33,811
Come on.

384
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,358
Tyler!

385
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,030
I called you this morning.

386
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,448
We're here to pick up a few things.

387
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,484
Oh, listen, Rollie, your equipment...

388
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,114
Oh, yeah.

389
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,780
Don't you worry about it. I know you blokes
got a lot on your mind. I'll get it later.

390
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,616
No, no. We'll deliver it.
Just give us a time.

391
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,959
Well, I got some things to do now,
but I'll be back home later this afternoon.

392
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,876
Fine. By the way, Rollie, is...

393
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,963
ls this something of yours?

394
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,343
Thanks. It's a remote transistor.
It goes with the projector.

395
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,053
Don't fool with me, Tyler.
It's a goddamn camera.

396
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,059
I want to know what it was doing there.

397
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,515
Mike wanted a camera. I got him a camera.

398
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,942
Mike didn't clear
any goddamn camera with me.

399
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,899
- It's not my problem, Silak.
- You're wrong, Tyler.

400
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,150
It is your problem.

401
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,273
And my problem.

402
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:30,985
What are you getting at?

403
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,907
The guy you say you saw on the stairs?

404
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,118
The guy you think killed Mike?

405
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,638
We're working on the possibility
that it might have been a cop.

406
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,342
- What makes you think that?
- I can't say now.

407
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:49,380
Did Mike ever talk about
any of his cases with you?

408
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,506
Any old, inactive files?

409
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,718
- No.
- Maybe with Kim, then.

410
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,228
Where are we going?

411
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,777
Jersey. I want you to spend
a couple of days with your sister.

412
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:06,526
Be great, wouldn't it, Chris?
See your cousin again?

413
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,865
<i>I don't want to go to my sister's.</i>

414
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,866
<i>It's too dangerous to go home right now.</i>

415
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,198
<i>- Dangerous?
- Yes, dangerous.</i>

416
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,825
<i>How could it be dangerous?</i>

417
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,206
<i>I mean, where are you gonna go?</i>

418
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,617
<i>- I got a few things to sort out.
- What things?</i>

419
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,543
<i>Why Mike was set up and who set him up.</i>

420
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,302
Don't worry about it.

421
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,557
Kim can borrow any
of my clothes that she needs.

422
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:39,892
Beth's gonna be here. Go on.

423
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,224
Now, don't go out.
Don't even answer the door.

424
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,017
Rollie, I can’t just disappear.
I have to go to work!

425
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,276
Trust me on this.

426
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,983
Rollie, I have a night class.

427
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,823
What if I can't get
anybody to cover for me?

428
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,574
Kim, it's not safe now.

429
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,991
What did you mean
about Mike being set up?

430
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,914
Silak thinks that Mike might have
been set up by some other cops.

431
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,491
- Hi!
- Hi, Beth.

432
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,451
Think you can look after your cousin
for a few days?

433
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,911
Yeah, okay.

434
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,756
I think I can help him.
I can't tell you any more.

435
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,174
Just do as I ask.

436
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,812
<i>Leo, I don't know
if you're getting these messages,</i>

437
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,686
<i>but if you are,
stop farting about and contact me.</i>

438
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,925
<i>I'm in real trouble with the cops
and I need your help.</i>

439
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,033
Okay. Now let's get a good look at you.

440
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,704
What are you doing?

441
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,113
Jesus, Silak.

442
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,218
Give me that tape.

443
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,630
Sure, take it. It's yours.

444
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,549
No. You get it.

445
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,853
How do you know I didn't make a copy?

446
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,021
Did you?

447
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,153
No, I wish I had.

448
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,990
Hiya, Rollie.

449
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,372
Are you gonna hang around
here all night, huh?

450
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,915
Great bloody timing, Leo.

451
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,419
Come on. Don't fuck up the roof of my car.

452
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,775
I'll lock the door, huh?

453
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,235
All right.

454
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,327
My little crash pad.

455
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,596
Jesus, and I thought I was paranoid.

456
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,697
Hey, you're the one that's looking for
a safe place.

457
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,745
What?

458
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,294
Jesus, what?

459
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,723
Christ! Jesus Christ!

460
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,262
Gotcha! I got you!

461
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,102
You bastard, Leo.

462
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,443
You bastard.
After what I've just been through?

463
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,735
<i>I got you!</i>

464
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,612
How could you do that to me?

465
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,990
Five years I've waited. I finally got you.

466
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,618
So you ended up with it.

467
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,824
What do you think, huh? Not bad, huh?

468
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,702
Always wanted my own gin mill.

469
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,906
Yeah.

470
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,289
- So who else knows about this place?
- Relax.

471
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,453
Nobody knows about this place.

472
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,085
Hell, nobody knew about it
when it was open.

473
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,170
I'm sorry it's a little messy.

474
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,217
The maid hasn't been in
in three or four years.

475
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,641
So, who'd you get to decorate the joint?
Rin Tin Tin?

476
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,559
I'm not gonna discuss fine art with you.

477
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,012
Get over here. Take your medicine.

478
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:26,933
You're telling me that this beacon
of journalistic accuracy

479
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,648
has got this cop-killing story all wrong?

480
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,108
It's bullshit, Leo. I'm telling you.

481
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,023
Silak must have set the whole thing up.

482
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,655
He's probably got the whole bloody
precinct out there now looking for me.

483
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,989
Why? Why would he do it?

484
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,822
He's got 25 years on the job.
He can retire anytime he wants to.

485
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,537
Why would he kill another cop,
one of his best friends?

486
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,335
I don't know why. You figure it out.

487
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,165
You tell me why those bastards were
going through Mike's place this morning.

488
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,670
Wait, what bastards?

489
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,835
The cops gave us a hard time.

490
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,118
Wanted to see everything we took out,
even Chris's toys.

491
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,181
Shit. That sounds like I.A.D.

492
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,176
What's I.A.D.?

493
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,852
Shooflies.

494
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:06,105
Cops who investigate other cops.
Internal affairs.

495
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,142
Yeah, that's what they were,
internal affairs.

496
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:11,523
- That's what Silak called them.
- Wait a minute.

497
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,688
Silak was at the apartment
with these guys?

498
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:14,821
You bet.

499
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,026
The only reason I.A.D. would be involved
in a cop-killing

500
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:19,660
is if they thought Mike was dirty.

501
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:21,287
Mike was not dirty.

502
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:22,864
No, I know he wasn't. That's the point.

503
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:26,330
Silak must've brought them in.
He's trying to deflect the investigation.

504
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:27,994
I think we're getting warm here, pal.

505
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,546
You might be getting warm.

506
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,590
These cops at the apartment,
did they ask you anything?

507
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,761
No, they just wanted us out of there, fast.

508
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,004
What about Silak?
Did he ask you anything?

509
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,381
Christ, Leo, I can't remember.

510
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,386
Rollie, this is important! Think!

511
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:43,768
Did he ask you anything at all?

512
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,892
He asked if Mike ever talked
about cases he was working on.

513
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,348
An inactive case, whatever that is.

514
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:52,439
That's it. It's a shit pile case.

515
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,065
What is a shit pile case?

516
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,738
It's a hobby case.

517
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,032
It's an old, unsolved, inactive case.

518
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,319
Cops pick them up, they screw around
with them on their own time.

519
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:02,574
That's what it's got to be.

520
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,658
So, what do we do now?

521
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,283
First, we have another drink.

522
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,416
Then we try to find the right shit pile.

523
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,172
Hi.

524
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,429
Surprise!

525
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,894
Leo! I can't believe it!

526
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:35,111
This is a restricted area
and you always just waltz right in.

527
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,403
How do you do it?

528
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:37,529
I lie.

529
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,529
Tell me about it.
You said you were gonna call me for dinner.

530
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,281
That was two years ago.

531
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,195
I thought you were supposed to call me.

532
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,951
I tried to call you, you bastard.

533
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:49,455
You look good.
Congratulations on your promotion.

534
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:50,618
Thank you.

535
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,127
How's your mother doing?

536
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:54,672
Spare me the Irish charm, Leo.

537
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:57,466
You didn't come up here
to ask about my mother or to see me.

538
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,756
And if you think
I'm going to risk my job again

539
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:02,889
by helping you find
some alimony cheat, you're crazy.

540
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,840
No, no, I don't do
matrimonial work anymore.

541
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:05,971
It's too dangerous.

542
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,010
Oh, yeah? What are you doing?

543
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:10,062
Actually, I'm working on
the Mike Brandon killing.

544
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,935
Forget it, Leo.

545
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,316
That's a high-profile investigation.

546
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,148
It's also a bullshit cover-up.

547
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,689
Who's your client?
Another sleazebag insurance company?

548
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:24,194
Actually, my client
is Brandon's 10-year-old son, Chris.

549
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,450
Hey, Velez.

550
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:29,828
I'm serious.

551
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:35,664
Damn. You sure know
how to push the right buttons.

552
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,377
Good girl.

553
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:41,002
Look, I'm interested in an old case
that Brandon was working on.

554
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,044
How far back?

555
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,472
Why don't you bring up
anything older than five years?

556
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,507
Do it like you never tapped in.

557
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:48,017
Don't worry.

558
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,696
Any luck?

559
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,160
How do you feel about
doing some telephone work?

560
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,290
Telephone work?

561
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:14,706
Hi, Ray.

562
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,547
Sergeant, I'll be back in an hour.

563
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:28,053
Listen, I'm a respectable citizen.
I want to file a complaint.

564
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,219
We got a new install and repair
for Lieutenant Shylock.

565
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,729
- You mean Silak.
- Silak? Yeah.

566
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,231
Yeah. You want the boxes
at the foot of the stairs.

567
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,309
- Great.
- Here's the key.

568
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,402
Don't return it, it's your ass.

569
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:41,733
No sweat.

570
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,128
Look at this!

571
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:09,056
Look at this, I really got it.
Almost got it.

572
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,649
You're wasting your time.
That thing hasn't worked in five years.

573
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,558
Hey!

574
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,223
Turn it down.

575
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,612
<i>- Hello?
- Yeah, Silak? It's Neely.</i>

576
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,275
<i>Tomorrow, trial part 52, 100 Center.</i>

577
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:28,530
<i>Yeah.</i>

578
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:31,078
<i>Remember, Tony Vargas
was the button man.</i>

579
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:34,581
<i>Yeah, I got it.
Don't sweat the little stuff, all right?</i>

580
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:38,119
<i>Hey, I see from the dailies
you neutralized the problem.</i>

581
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,624
<i>- Nice</i> work.
- Yeah,

582
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,960
<i>but it didn't go down as clean as I want.</i>

583
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,918
<i>- How's the old man doing?
- Sliding fast.</i>

584
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:46,632
<i>Don't screw it up.</i>

585
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,717
<i>You do your end, I'll do mine.</i>

586
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:51,390
Silak, you scumbag.

587
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,465
So, are you gonna tell me?
What was all that about?

588
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,604
It's about me spending the day
in court tomorrow.

589
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,658
Mr. Neely, is it a fact you're coming up
for a parole board hearing soon?

590
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,957
Yes.

591
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:20,119
Now, Mr. Neely, tell us, please,

592
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,959
how was it you learned
who ordered the murder of the decedent?

593
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,378
Tony Vargas told me.

594
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,549
And what did he say?

595
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,091
That Moore hired him as the button man.

596
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,217
That's a goddamn lie!

597
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:33,675
Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay.

598
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:36,560
Sustained.
You may continue, Miss Kennedy.

599
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,767
Where were you when
Vargas told you this?

600
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:41,395
In C-81 at Rikers.

601
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:44,519
He said Moore wanted him iced
because he knew too much about the...

602
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:47,822
Objection, Your Honor!
May we have a sidebar?

603
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,697
Approach the bench.

604
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,367
Judge, I object to this
line of questioning.

605
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,913
I'd like to know what promises have been
made to the witness for his testimony.

606
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:06,124
Miss Kennedy,
do you have any response to this?

607
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,085
Yes, we're sending a letter to the parole
board acknowledging his assistance

608
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:11,512
in this case
and counsel is well aware of this fact.

609
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,842
I don't want this to drag on.

610
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,678
Neither do I, Counselor. Neither do I.

611
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,217
'Hey, Leo!
- Hey.

612
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,426
I'm surprised to see you.

613
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,556
- Hey, long time.
- Yeah.

614
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,392
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you. And you.

615
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:22,439
No black eyes, no broken noses.

616
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,766
What's that supposed to mean?

617
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,692
Well, you're doing divorce work now,
you know.

618
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:29,006
Somebody opens the door too quickly and
you're still peeking through the keyhole...

619
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,695
That's right. That's right.
Kick an old pal when he's down.

620
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,576
Well, you deserve it.
You were the best cop I ever worked with.

621
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,453
Just too goddamned bullheaded
to play by the rules.

622
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,828
Hey! Are we talking professional now?
Or personal?

623
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:43,707
Oh, believe me, Leo, I forgot about
that other stuff a long time ago.

624
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:45,872
You lose a bet?

625
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,845
Thank you. Bring me the Doolan file.

626
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,597
- It's on your desk.
- On my desk.

627
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,261
Leo, you want coffee?

628
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,645
Yeah, I'll take some coffee. Black, please.

629
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,347
Two black coffees! That'll take an hour.

630
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,626
- Where do you want this?
- Just there is great. Thank you.

631
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:09,941
Not bad.

632
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,273
Look at this.

633
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:16,031
Liz Kennedy, the smartest kid
ever to come out of St. Cecili♪s Parish.

634
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,871
How come you didn't go with
some big-time corporate law firm

635
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,547
up there on Madison Avenue or someplace.

636
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,667
Make yourself some serious money?

637
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:27,121
I like trench warfare.
Madison Avenue is advertising, Leo.

638
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,288
What can I do for you?

639
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,962
I want to talk to your witness, Neely.

640
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,388
Well, call legal aid.
Neely's not my client.

641
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:37,464
No.

642
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,642
Come on, Liz. This is
Leo you're talking to.

643
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:42,599
Neely's making you famous,
for Christ's sake.

644
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,309
You got two major convictions
already with his testimony.

645
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:45,389
So?

646
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:48,021
You probably eat your tuna fish sandwich
with the creep right up here every day.

647
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,068
What's the matter? You never used
stoolies when you were a cop?

648
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,737
Oh, yeah. Sure, I used stoolies.

649
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,315
I didn't actually sit down
and write out their dialog

650
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,859
for them to recite in court
in exchange for sentence reduction.

651
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,320
Hey, hey, I don't do that.
Everything he testified to

652
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,614
is in line with the information
we gathered before hand

653
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,202
in our own investigation.

654
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,632
Who was in charge of that investigation?

655
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,334
Lieutenant out of the 2-7
named Ray Silak. You know him?

656
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,339
Yeah, I know him a little.

657
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:25,726
Yeah, Silak's been all over the papers
lately with this cop-killing.

658
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:27,223
This Mike Brandon thing?

659
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:30,025
Yeah. That's nothing to
do with this office.

660
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,526
Now tell me Liz, you trust Silak?

661
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,064
What are you saying here? Silak's dirty?

662
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,533
If he is, you don't want it rubbing off
on you, do you, Senator?

663
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,196
I am not involved
in politics in any way, Leo.

664
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,744
No, I know, I know. You told me.

665
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:47,542
What have you got on Ray Silak?
Who are you working for, Leo?

666
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,603
I don't have to tell you who I'm
working for. You know that.

667
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,880
As far as Silak is concerned,
all I have right now are suspicions.

668
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,546
Now, you could be in big trouble here
and not even know it.

669
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:01,306
Maybe I can help you,
but you got to help me first.

670
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:04,556
Okay? Come on, come on, come on.

671
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:07,221
Fix it so I can talk to
this motor mouth Neely.

672
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,104
Get me Chambliss in parole.

673
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:17,781
Norm Chambliss is Neely's parole officer.

674
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,780
The nuns would be proud of you, darling.

675
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,457
I really appreciate your time.

676
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,632
It's a pleasure.

677
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,630
What can you tell me
about this asshole, anyway?

678
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:41,555
Well, Neely started off strictly
small-time, fencing shit in college.

679
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,675
Got popped a couple of times,
he rolled over,

680
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,260
earned his stoolie jacket.

681
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,391
That turned out to be his true vocation.

682
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,645
So now, they put him in
with the real bad guys, he gets them to...

683
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,360
Just shut your mouth.

684
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,857
He gets them to shoot off their mouths.

685
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:58,177
Then he testifies against them.

686
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,607
Baboom! He gets an early out.

687
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,290
All right. How come he's back in prison?

688
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,451
The dumb ass violated his parole.

689
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,078
It's like he wanted to get sent here.

690
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,115
So, is he being a good boy this time?

691
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,284
Listen to this...

692
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,290
Chambliss. State parole.
Want to see Neely.

693
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:13,954
Thank you.

694
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,380
A model inmate.

695
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,502
Oh, Jesus.

696
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:19,756
Works here in the infirmary
a couple times a week as a volunteer.

697
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,466
This guy's even a chaplain's clerk.

698
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,677
Another scumbag comes to jail
and finds the Lord, huh?

699
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,133
What are these guys? The choir?

700
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,775
Jesus, very butch.
What is he, a boy soprano?

701
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,145
There he is.

702
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,196
Yeah, yeah, I see him.

703
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:42,024
A regular St. Francis of Assisi, isn't he?

704
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,199
Yeah.

705
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:45,118
What's the story on the old con
he's talking to?

706
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:47,575
Oh, Carl. He's been here forever.

707
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,536
Dying of emphysema. Any day now.

708
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,334
Tough old bastard, though.

709
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,496
Another con sliced him up
some years back.

710
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:58,332
Carl stuck a shiv through the guy's throat.

711
00:56:58,415 --> 00:56:59,541
So they gave him life.

712
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,093
"He, answering, said to his father..."

713
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:03,170
Looks like he's gonna do it all, too.

714
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:07,433
Chaplain says
that Carl has been very good for Neely.

715
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:08,508
That's great.

716
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,348
He says, he brought
the young man back to the church,

717
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,511
don't you know?

718
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,932
Becker treats the kid like a son.

719
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,232
Becker. What...

720
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,770
Carl Becker. Jesus Christ.

721
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,235
That's Carl Becker.

722
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:26,285
Yeah, that's what I said, Carl Becker.
Wait here.

723
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,991
"Thou art ever with me
and all that I have is thine."

724
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:33,417
Hey, Carl. Neely.

725
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,374
Got a Pl here named Leo McCarthy.

726
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,876
He wants five minutes of your time.
What do you think?

727
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,713
No. Absolutely not.

728
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:43,922
Five minutes of your time.
What's it gonna take?

729
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,970
"For this, thy brother
was dead and is alive again."

730
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:50,517
Thanks a lot.

731
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,636
"And was lost,

732
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,055
"and is found."

733
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,445
Hey. So, there you are.

734
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:10,283
Jesus Christ. You went
back to the apartment, didn't you?

735
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,205
Couldn't sit around all day.

736
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:14,833
God, you stubborn son of a bitch.
You're like a 10-year-old.

737
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,708
- Where you been?
- What is this shit, anyway?

738
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:19,330
What the hell is this?

739
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:20,915
Say good day to Bluey.

740
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:22,708
How are you, pal? Nice to meet you.

741
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,469
You're not eating that shit, are you?
It's been there for five years.

742
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,381
Do me a favor, will you?
Stay away from the pickled eggs.

743
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,561
I've been at the library. Pardon me,
would you, sir? Thank you very much.

744
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,605
I found out why Mike was killed.

745
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,105
All right, here.

746
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,312
Saint Peter's in Rome. The Vatican. Okay?

747
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:49,951
It's the Sistine Chapel.

748
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:52,613
These bronze-colored reliefs show scenes

749
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,907
from the Old Testament Book of Kings.

750
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:58,293
Okay? From here to here,
the gradual conversion

751
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,166
of the human soul to God.

752
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,297
When he finished the Sistine Chapel,

753
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,049
Michelangelo re-creates these reliefs

754
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,129
in solid gold.

755
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:11,761
Ten medallions about so big.

756
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,434
This is the case that Mike was working on.

757
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,095
About 20 years ago,

758
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:19,057
these medallions were part
of the Vatican exhibit

759
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:20,356
at the Metropolitan Museum.

760
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,482
A guy named Carl Becker, pretty good thief,

761
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,526
he sneaks in and he grabs them.

762
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:28,607
The dumb son of a bitch.

763
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,571
I don't know what he thought
he was gonna do with them.

764
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:34,245
Now Becker gets pinched
the very next day, but the medallions,

765
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:35,660
they never turn up.

766
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:42,171
Now, these are original, hand-minted,
solid gold Michelangelos.

767
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:44,883
You got any idea
what they'd be worth today?

768
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,254
What do you reckon, Blue?

769
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:51,217
Close enough, Bluey.

770
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,632
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

771
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:56,313
- See you later, Miss Brandon.
- All right, I'll see you next week.

772
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,660
Becker. Jesus. I know I know that name.

773
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,544
It was a famous case.
It made all the papers.

774
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,372
No.

775
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:26,965
Oh, Christ. I know where I heard it.

776
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,134
- Where?
- Just a... Just a minute.

777
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:30,927
Who the hell you callin'?
Don't tell them where you are.

778
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,470
I'm not tellin' anyone. Just quiet.

779
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,882
Come on!

780
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:41,267
- Hello.
- Beth.

781
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,815
Hi. Rollie. Put Kim on, will you?

782
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,062
She's not here, Rollie.

783
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,147
Where is she?

784
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,443
<i>She went to her class.</i>

785
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:49,442
Put your mother on, then, will you?

786
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:51,615
She's shopping.
It's just Chris and me here now.

787
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:52,862
Then I'll speak to Chris.

788
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,742
What the hell is goin' on here? What?

789
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:55,868
Chris, it's for you.

790
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,696
I know where Mike's file is.

791
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:01,082
Becker was a name
on one of Chris's game disks.

792
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:03,494
Jesus Christ. If Silak finds that out...

793
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:05,666
Yeah? What?

794
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,305
You don't think he'll go after the kid?

795
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:11,877
<i>- Hello?
- Chris, hi, it's Rollie. How are you?</i>

796
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,420
Listen, I need your help.

797
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:18,429
Do you remember the name Becker
on one of your game disks?

798
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,555
What if I do?

799
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,646
Well, I need to know what was in that file.

800
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,267
They don't have a computer here.

801
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:25,102
Listen, Chris, how you doin'?

802
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,939
Look, my name is Leo.
I'm a friend of Rollie's.

803
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,854
<i>Do you know anybody out there
who might have</i> a <i>computer?</i>

804
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,314
Yeah, over at the mall.

805
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,037
Do you want me to send it to you
by modem?

806
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,112
Yeah, that's a good idea.

807
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,652
He's not to leave the house.

808
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:39,784
That's a good idea, Chris. Go to the mall.
I want you to send it to me.

809
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:40,955
He's not to leave the bloody house!

810
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,328
He'll be safer there. There's people there.

811
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,704
- Bullshit!
- Where the hell are you going?

812
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:44,909
To get Kim.

813
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:48,501
Listen, Chris. Yeah, it's okay. Listen.

814
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,706
<i>Have you got a pencil?</i>

815
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:50,790
Yeah.

816
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,483
- Hello?
- Beth, is Kim back yet?

817
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:15,615
<i>No, she isn't, Rollie.
She went to pick up Chris at the mall.</i>

818
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:17,401
<i>She just left five minutes ago.</i>

819
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:18,485
Thanks.

820
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,332
I hate waiting.

821
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,624
Me, too.

822
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,336
And I've had a lot of practice, believe me.

823
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:34,009
I know I'm gonna regret asking this,
but what is that supposed to mean?

824
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:38,680
Every once in my life you walk in,
use my computer, use me.

825
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:39,927
Then you disappear.

826
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,179
It's not right, Leo.

827
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,097
You're absolutely right, Velez.

828
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,399
You know what you need?

829
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,149
A vacation.

830
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:58,362
Leo. I can't believe it!

831
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,902
- Jamaica!
- Yeah.

832
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,579
Am I going alone?

833
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:06,158
Well, I don't know. What date does it say?

834
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,702
Let me see. It's open.

835
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,208
Really? The same as mine.

836
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:15,209
Leo, you shouldn't have.

837
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:22,975
Yes, I should have.
I should have a long time ago.

838
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,301
There are other things
I shouldn't have done,

839
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:25,636
but this I should have done.

840
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:27,270
<i>Attention, shoppers.</i>

841
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,847
<i>The mall will be closing in 10 minutes.</i>

842
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,014
Need any help, Chris?

843
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,057
No, I'm okay.

844
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,734
Okay, we gotta close in a minute.

845
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,025
Leo.

846
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,407
- Yeah.
- This is Chris. ls Leo there?

847
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:41,409
Yeah, Chris, this is Leo.

848
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:44,579
Hold on a second. Listen, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna put the expert on, okay?

849
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:48,242
<i>Hi, Chris.
Have you ever used a modem before?</i>

850
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:50,502
- Yeah.
- Ls your program up?

851
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,170
- Yup.
- Okay.

852
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,622
Press F1

853
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:56,174
and then type in the same phone number
you just called.

854
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:06,051
Okay, now hang up, press enter
and I'll talk to you on your screen, okay?

855
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,093
<i>Okay-</i>

856
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:13,600
Chris. What are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the house.

857
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,314
But, Mom, we found dad's file.

858
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,077
Give me the disk.

859
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:33,703
It's stuck.

860
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,334
Here we go.

861
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,211
Way to go, kid.

862
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,463
All right. My God, look at how fast it is.

863
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:40,673
Are we gonna get a printout on this?

864
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:42,129
- Yes.
- All right.

865
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:44,093
"Becker. Vatican medallions."

866
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,929
Okay. "Neely. Samson"?

867
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,682
That's a new one.
Samson. What the hell is that?

868
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,558
There's Samson again.

869
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:54,975
What's goin' on here? We got garbage.

870
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,732
Oh, no. The transmission's
been interrupted.

871
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,155
The kid screwed it up.

872
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:01,815
See if you can find out what's going on.

873
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:02,982
Okay.

874
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,338
I guess that's the end of it.

875
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:20,046
Well, print it out.
We'll take a closer look at it.

876
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,843
- Why don't we go get something to eat?
- Okay.

877
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:24,925
I know a great place. They serve
the best Chinese food in the city.

878
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,132
- Great.
- We'll celebrate, all right?

879
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:29,017
<i>Attention, shoppers.</i>

880
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,345
<i>The West Side Mall is now closed.</i>

881
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:34,560
<i>We open again tomorrow
from 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.</i>

882
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:37,859
<i>And please note,
tomorrow, many stores are participating</i>

883
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:40,520
<i>in the one-day sale,
with discounts of up</i> to...

884
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,071
Excuse me, sir. We're closed.

885
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:43,194
Yeah.

886
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:45,199
Hey! I said we're closed!

887
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:46,743
Hey, watch it, pal!

888
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:54,951
Kim? You all right?

889
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,251
Yeah.

890
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,374
What's your problem?

891
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:59,506
Leave me. He's got a gun.

892
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:01,132
Don't be...

893
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:05,928
- Kim, run!
- Chris!

894
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,391
Open up.

895
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:21,770
Get lost.

896
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,657
Here.

897
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:44,770
Yeah. Come on.

898
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:10,678
Kim, hair spray.

899
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,605
- It's locked.
- Damn!

900
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:53,716
You shouldn't believe everything you see!

901
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:10,021
Now, you bastard, I want some answers.

902
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:18,858
Let's start with Silak.

903
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:25,449
<i>Silak, we have a problem.</i>

904
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:27,454
<i>Becker's taken a turn for the worse.</i>

905
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,952
What do the doctors say?

906
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,379
<i>He won't last the night.</i>

907
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:34,040
You'd better have
a goddamn heart-to-heart,

908
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,548
and if you want out of there on Saturday,
don't screw it up.

909
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:39,258
Good night, Mom.

910
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:43,569
Chris wants to say good night to you.

911
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:56,237
Some day, eh?

912
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:00,487
Do you think they got the file?

913
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,318
I'm sure they did.

914
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:06,532
Your dad would have been
very proud of you today.

915
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:12,211
That man, did he kill my father?

916
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:17,727
I think you should get a little sleep.

917
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:23,006
I never really thought it was your fault.

918
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:25,304
I know that.

919
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:37,737
Is this great or what?

920
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:43,068
I was picturing something
a little different, you know?

921
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:45,578
Candles, a bottle of wine.

922
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,204
Maybe a table and a chair.

923
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,749
Come on. This place is the best.

924
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:52,462
Frenchie here is the best Chinese cook
in New York, right, Frenchie?

925
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:53,585
You bet.

926
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:56,419
You betcha. We're gonna take
a couple spring rolls to start, all right?

927
01:12:56,914 --> 01:13:00,168
I'll tell you,
I keep reading this and reading it.

928
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,800
"Samson. Samson."
Samson must be the buyer.

929
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:05,131
It's probably a code name of some kind.

930
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:07,300
Thing I don't get is
why the hell Mike didn't figure out

931
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:09,543
Silak was involved in this thing
right from the get-go.

932
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:11,722
Obviously, he was getting very close.

933
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:13,602
He was in over his head.
He should have known it.

934
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,516
Okay. Two spring roll.

935
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,068
- Okay.
- Okay.

936
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:18,190
- Here you go. Ready?
- Some mustard.

937
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:20,067
No, don't, don't put that mustard on.

938
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,524
- No, that stuff is murder, really.
- Leo, you're such a wuss.

939
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:24,325
Come on. It'll take the roof
right off your mouth.

940
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,697
- Leave it alone.
- You're such a wuss.

941
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:26,823
That's plenty. That's plenty.

942
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:27,862
Okay.

943
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,288
I don't even want to watch this.

944
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:47,716
Velez!

945
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:59,193
Father, could I have a moment alone
with him, please?

946
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,205
Can you hear me, Carl?

947
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:17,078
I'm gonna die.

948
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,214
No, Carl.

949
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,542
You're going to meet God.

950
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:32,223
You once said that you wanted my help
to atone for your sins.

951
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,393
It's not too late, Carl.

952
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:40,735
Tell me where the medallions are

953
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:43,271
and I'll give them back to God.

954
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:51,070
Where's the music?

955
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,832
What happened to you?

956
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:58,711
Velez is dead.

957
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,589
They shot her about an hour ago.

958
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,922
Chinatown, for Christ sake.

959
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,264
I'm sorry.

960
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:13,267
Yeah, me, too.

961
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:16,263
She was...

962
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:20,441
She was a good cop.

963
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:26,109
They tried to get me, too.

964
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:29,821
It was a mob hit, Rollie.

965
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:37,747
There's more to this whole thing than
a dirty cop and 10 shitty pieces of gold.

966
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,384
I had a talk to the guy that killed Mike.

967
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,540
Yeah? ls he a cop?

968
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:44,874
No, just some thug.

969
01:15:46,417 --> 01:15:49,466
Silak's got a chopper
ordered for this weekend.

970
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,847
There's some sort of rendezvous.
I know where.

971
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:56,685
We're gonna need backup.

972
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:02,767
I think I know someone who can help us.

973
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:07,484
- Oh, God!
- For God's sake.

974
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:08,815
- Hold still. Hold still.
- That stings! What is that?

975
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:10,608
Come on. Don't be such a baby.

976
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:12,826
Why don't you just leave this to NYPD?

977
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:16,031
Because somebody else in the department
could be involved in this thing.

978
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,865
Look, look, look. Either they followed me

979
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:19,825
and killing Velez
was some kind of an accident,

980
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:22,162
or they picked up on Velez
through the computer.

981
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:25,395
When she tapped in,
she left some kind of a trace, something!

982
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:28,627
Either way, I can't take any chances.

983
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,761
- Enough with the alcohol, please!
- Okay.

984
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:33,464
Unless you have
some of the drinking kind out there.

985
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:36,976
Excuse me. Where are my manners?
Just a second.

986
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:39,975
Look, if I have a choice,
I'll take a scotch.

987
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:43,516
Hey, if you have a single malt,
you could make it a triple.

988
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:45,355
Saves all that walking back and forth.

989
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,144
Jesus Christ.

990
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:48,980
What's wrong with your cat?

991
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:52,070
There's nothing wrong with my cat.
She's a Cornish Rex.

992
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,526
They don't shed.

993
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,735
Are you telling me that...

994
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:57,951
Are you telling me that
they look like this on purpose?

995
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:00,875
Looks like a big rat.

996
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,550
Leo, you want ice?

997
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:15,885
What, in this? No. You got to be kidding.

998
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:17,015
No, for your head.

999
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:20,435
No, my head's fine.

1000
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:27,439
Look, Liz, you got to help me here, huh?

1001
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:28,690
Maybe help yourself, too.

1002
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,855
I mean, you could be
a real hero with this thing.

1003
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:33,740
You know how many assistant D♪s
work their whole goddamn lives,

1004
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:35,784
they never get an opportunity like this?

1005
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,158
Don't hustle me, Leo.
Opportunity for what?

1006
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:40,239
Wreck my career? Get killed, maybe?

1007
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:44,834
What do you need?

1008
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:48,752
I need backup. But local backup, okay?

1009
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,989
Nassau County cops,
the sheriff's department, something.

1010
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,588
No NYPD.

1011
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:53,760
That's it? What else?

1012
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:56,468
You got to be there.

1013
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:59,426
Me? No. I'm...
I'm an assistant DA. I don't do that.

1014
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:00,885
Hey, I'm a private investigator.

1015
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,394
You think those country cops out there

1016
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:03,975
are gonna do what I tell them to do?
No way.

1017
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:05,601
No, you got to be there.

1018
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,399
This could be your ticket, Liz.

1019
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:09,685
Somebody's got to prosecute
these Bastards.

1020
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:11,736
Somebody's got to talk to the press.

1021
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:12,817
Who better?

1022
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:19,653
Do I take that as a yes?

1023
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:32,675
Keep your nose clean, Neely.

1024
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,127
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1025
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:43,890
I'll see you, Neely.

1026
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,993
Neely, over here.

1027
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,113
Come on.

1028
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,517
All right, we're stopped. Now, look.

1029
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:32,901
Enough of this shit. Where we going?

1030
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:35,071
Hey, relax. We're here.

1031
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,781
- Where?
- Come on.

1032
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,033
Let's confess our sins.

1033
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:21,492
Thank God for the sacrament
of his love and forgiveness.

1034
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:25,197
Place your confidence in Christ,
who died for you on the cross.

1035
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:28,286
For your penance.
Say five Our Fathers and five Hail Marys.

1036
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:29,833
He'll forgive your sins.

1037
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:34,209
I absolve you of your sins in the name
of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

1038
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:35,668
Go in peace.

1039
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:52,564
Welcome to this sacrament of forgiveness.

1040
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:54,441
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

1041
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:56,898
It has been one week
since my last confession.

1042
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:58,152
Continue, my son.

1043
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:00,940
I felt anger, Father,

1044
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:04,322
towards an old man
who had been my friend.

1045
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:06,828
It was unworthy.

1046
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:12,619
I also lied three times in the past week.

1047
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:18,083
Yeah, I had a couple of impure thoughts.

1048
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:20,960
And I...

1049
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:24,380
Feel very regretful.

1050
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:27,015
Anything else, my son?

1051
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:29,434
No, Father, that's it.

1052
01:21:50,948 --> 01:21:54,202
Oh. Sorry, Father. I was deep in thought.

1053
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:57,330
The eleventh station of the cross.

1054
01:21:57,371 --> 01:21:59,669
Jesus is nailed to the cross.

1055
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:01,963
We adore you, oh, Christ,
and we praise thee.

1056
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:08,762
And they came to Golgotha,
the place called the Skull.

1057
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:11,310
They crucified Jesus and the robbers

1058
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:14,142
one on his right, the other on his left.

1059
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:16,853
And Jesus said, "Father, forgive them

1060
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,359
"for they do not know
what they are doing."

1061
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:50,015
<i>- Yeah.
- It's Rollie. ls Leo there?</i>

1062
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:51,846
Yeah. It's Rollie.

1063
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,978
<i>- Yeah.
- I'm all set, mate.</i>

1064
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:55,652
All right, good. We're on the way. Yeah.

1065
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:25,008
We're expected.

1066
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,084
Who says?

1067
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:27,169
Samson.

1068
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:42,276
Jesus. I don't think we asked for enough.

1069
01:23:44,061 --> 01:23:45,062
Hey-

1070
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:47,656
Watch what you say in here.

1071
01:24:07,084 --> 01:24:09,132
Go. Go.

1072
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:03,329
I hope Rollie's ready.

1073
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:06,082
He should be. He's been setting
it up for a couple of days.

1074
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:08,417
This is good right here.

1075
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:55,962
Cue ball, corner pocket.

1076
01:26:59,381 --> 01:27:00,382
I warned you.

1077
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:04,307
Can you see Rollie?

1078
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:06,980
No, but he's got the dogs penned up.

1079
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,308
The gardener hasn't noticed anything.

1080
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:10,726
I didn't see any backup.

1081
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:12,811
You're not supposed to, Leo.

1082
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:15,734
Do me a favor, will you? Get on the horn.
Make sure they're in position.

1083
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:20,077
Nassau one, this is LK.
We're all set. Over.

1084
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:27,079
All right.
Did you bring any protection with you?

1085
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:28,706
I mean, a gun?

1086
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:31,254
No. You said there'd be plenty of artillery
when we got here.

1087
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:32,421
This is New York.

1088
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:34,716
There's no such thing
as too much artillery in New York.

1089
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:36,755
- You ever use an automatic?
- No.

1090
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:40,551
Okay. This is the way you cock the sucker,
so to speak.

1091
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:41,631
- All right.
- All right?

1092
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:43,346
There's your safety. On, off.

1093
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:45,226
- Okay.
- Okay? Hold on to it.

1094
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:47,846
<i>Leo? It's Rollie.</i>

1095
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:49,681
Yeah, go ahead, Rollie.

1096
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:50,766
<i>Looking good.</i>

1097
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:54,027
Okay, buddy. Just wait for my signal.

1098
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:56,855
Leo, please be careful.

1099
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:58,441
You, too.

1100
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:26,555
What?

1101
01:28:30,388 --> 01:28:31,640
Gotcha.

1102
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:07,930
Hi, guys.

1103
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:11,600
Now, everybody, just relax, okay?

1104
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,604
- McCarthy.
- You know this man?

1105
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:15,684
Yeah.

1106
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:18,900
NYPD, retired. He's a private dick now.

1107
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:21,941
Damn it, Silak, this is the guy that
was snooping around at the prison.

1108
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:23,115
Hey, listen, fellows.

1109
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:25,368
We'll all get acquainted
in a minute, all right?

1110
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:26,444
Just stand easy.

1111
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:27,533
I knew this was too good to be true.

1112
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:30,035
Liz, it's Leo. Send in the cavalry.

1113
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:33,956
Liz, come back.

1114
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:42,260
Okay, Leo,
I've cocked the sucker. Take his gun.

1115
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:47,469
You're a great disappointment to me.

1116
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:49,100
Just move, Leo.

1117
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:54,056
You were expecting this, Silak?

1118
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:55,766
Shut up, Neely. Leave everything...

1119
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:59,482
I suppose this means
that the backup's not coming, too.

1120
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:01,355
You said there were two.

1121
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:03,026
Tyler's out there somewhere.

1122
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:04,699
Tyler? Who the hell is he?

1123
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:06,902
What the hell is goin' on?

1124
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:09,079
- Call him, Leo.
- Kiss my ass, sweetheart.

1125
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:13,242
Never point a gun
unless you intend to use it.

1126
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:15,827
This right with the safety? Little red dot?

1127
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:21,424
Hey, be careful with those things,
all right? It's an automatic. Okay?

1128
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,509
Rollie, this is Leo.

1129
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:27,673
Look, it's, lions eight,
Christians nothing in here.

1130
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:29,929
Somebody's pointing a gun at my head
even as we speak.

1131
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:31,510
I think it's time to pack it up.

1132
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:34,854
Rollie?

1133
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:39,359
I guess he's out of range.

1134
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:43,105
Wait. Who the hell are these guys, Silak?

1135
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:49,699
Yes, she was a fine Catholic girl, Father.

1136
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:51,742
I don't know
what could have happened to her.

1137
01:30:51,821 --> 01:30:53,243
Shut up, please, Leo.

1138
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:09,427
Enjoy your trip?

1139
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:12,976
You're going on another one.

1140
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:21,226
<i>Ben voyage.</i>

1141
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:34,994
- How long is this gonna take?
- Until it's over.

1142
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:36,575
You got the medallions, so pay up.

1143
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:39,036
You can put 'em in your vault
and look at 'em on rainy days.

1144
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:41,330
- Shut up, will you?
- You screwed up, Silak.

1145
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:42,414
What?

1146
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:44,833
You didn't check out
who really owns this place, did you?

1147
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:45,917
What does he mean?

1148
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:47,423
You always were an asshole, McCarthy.

1149
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:50,472
What, do you think this place
belongs to some fence, for Christ sake?

1150
01:31:50,547 --> 01:31:53,141
Huh? These guys look like
art collectors to you?

1151
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,218
This is a mob safe house, Neely.

1152
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:58,104
Nobody said nothin' about the mob.

1153
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:01,058
Their money's the same as anybody else's,
or don't you think so?

1154
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:02,521
So when do we see it?

1155
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:12,702
All right.

1156
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:22,962
Old bills, as you requested.

1157
01:32:22,996 --> 01:32:25,624
It'll take you a long while
to count to 10 million.

1158
01:32:25,665 --> 01:32:26,712
Ten?

1159
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:29,965
Oh, Jesus, here we go.
What did he tell you, kid? Five?

1160
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:31,346
Huh? Two and a half apiece?

1161
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:33,719
Or was your end supposed to be
parole and car fare?

1162
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:36,847
- You son of a bitch, Silak.
- Hold it. You were gonna get a full cut.

1163
01:32:36,926 --> 01:32:38,086
- Of what?
- Of the 10 million.

1164
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:40,013
Bullshit! I was the one
who got Becker to talk!

1165
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:42,224
If it wasn't for me,
you and that bitch would be nowhere.

1166
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:45,231
The kid is absolutely right, Silak.
You deserve a 60/40 split.

1167
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:46,311
Shut your foul trap!

1168
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:47,566
Maybe it should be 70/30.

1169
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:49,845
I mean, you're the one
who had to go back inside, right?

1170
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:52,117
The words double-cross
definitely come to my mind.

1171
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:54,824
- The word dead man comes to my mind.
- That's two words.

1172
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:56,701
Please. Please.

1173
01:32:57,822 --> 01:33:00,325
I apologize for these interruptions.

1174
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,081
It'll soon be over.

1175
01:33:06,873 --> 01:33:08,090
They are his work.

1176
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,085
Michelangelo.

1177
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:11,552
Very good.

1178
01:33:13,171 --> 01:33:15,765
You know where they have to go.
Boat's waiting for you.

1179
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,092
Yes, sir.

1180
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:19,685
May I go, too?

1181
01:33:19,761 --> 01:33:21,058
Yes. Thank you for your help.

1182
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:22,514
Thank you.

1183
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:43,413
How about that, Silak?

1184
01:33:43,493 --> 01:33:46,372
You tell the chopper noon,
the man's here right on the button.

1185
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:49,048
Now all you gotta do
is get out of here alive.

1186
01:33:49,082 --> 01:33:51,710
You don't think they're gonna let you
walk with that cash, do you, kid?

1187
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:53,795
Don't listen to him. The money's yours.

1188
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:55,471
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

1189
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:58,767
Silak, wait, wait. Before we break up
the party here, answer me something.

1190
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:00,560
Now that you got these medallions,

1191
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,137
what the hell are you gonna do with 'em?

1192
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,346
Who's the buyer?

1193
01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:05,022
There's no buyer.

1194
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:07,150
They're being returned
to their rightful owner.

1195
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:10,399
Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1196
01:34:11,396 --> 01:34:13,436
What, are you telling me
the Vatican is behind this?

1197
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:14,482
No.

1198
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:18,028
Our associates in Italy have
never condoned crimes against the church.

1199
01:34:18,528 --> 01:34:20,246
This is our way of righting a wrong.

1200
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:25,793
Come on, Neely. Let's...

1201
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:27,337
Silak, you dumb shit!

1202
01:34:27,412 --> 01:34:29,492
You go out that door,
they'll fill you full of holes.

1203
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:32,087
Now, hold it a second.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1204
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:36,592
Are we forgetting somebody here?
What about Liz?

1205
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:38,472
Where's her share?

1206
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:41,684
Who's supposed to pay you, anyway?

1207
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:44,729
Mr. Pizza man here, or Moe and Larry?

1208
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:47,311
I mean, they were gonna cut you in
on this deal, weren't they?

1209
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:49,768
Don't be stupid, Leo.
I'm not in this for the money.

1210
01:34:49,809 --> 01:34:50,856
That's enough.

1211
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:54,822
Son of a bitch. Of course.

1212
01:34:56,191 --> 01:34:58,569
You're gettin' into bed with the mob,
aren't you?

1213
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:02,615
You're gonna be connected
to all that influence

1214
01:35:02,655 --> 01:35:03,998
and that power.

1215
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:07,661
Well, tell me, Liz. What
do you get out of it?

1216
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:10,623
What, the DA? US attorney?

1217
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:12,749
Or was I right the first time?

1218
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:15,589
You gonna be the next senator
from the state of pasta fazul?

1219
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:17,425
Would you please just shut up, Leo?

1220
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:20,719
- All right, game's over. Give me the gun.
- No.

1221
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:23,301
Oh, bullshit! You're not gonna shoot me.

1222
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:24,970
You guys, stay out of this.

1223
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:28,473
It's between her and me.

1224
01:35:28,598 --> 01:35:29,815
Don't look at him. He's not gonna help you.

1225
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:32,648
He wants you to do it. Sure!

1226
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:35,901
Yeah. He wants you to make
your bones right here, right now, with me.

1227
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:38,074
That way he owns your ass forever.

1228
01:35:39,192 --> 01:35:40,819
Is that what you want? Huh?

1229
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,290
- Come on, give me the gun.
- Don't do this.

1230
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:45,619
Jesus, God, please! Don't.

1231
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:46,783
Give me the gun, come on.

1232
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:47,825
Please!

1233
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:24,241
Let's get out of here.

1234
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,833
L...

1235
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:37,629
Silak!

1236
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:42,304
Damn!

1237
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:45,054
Life's a bitch, Neely and then...

1238
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:58,442
Jesus Christ.
You call that a small fire effect?

1239
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:04,744
Well, it's not an exact bloody science.
Christ, I stink.

1240
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:07,368
Let's go. Chopper's about to take off.

1241
01:37:07,405 --> 01:37:09,248
Yeah. I'll catch up with you in a minute.

1242
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:17,875
Yeah, he's messy, but he's fun at parties.

1243
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:20,676
When did you know?

1244
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:25,343
I'm a good detective.

1245
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:29,556
I got lucky.

1246
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:31,771
Big name for a little cat.

1247
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:33,730
Samson.

1248
01:37:34,432 --> 01:37:36,150
I wondered where the hell that thing went.

1249
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,317
Okay, Leo, it's your call.

1250
01:37:51,449 --> 01:37:54,373
I wonder if I could kill you
as easily as you killed me.

1251
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:05,964
Now, there's the backup you ordered.

1252
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:09,509
I called them, too, just
in case you forgot.

1253
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:14,898
Why don't you explain all this to them?

1254
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,407
Come on, mate! I'm losin' him!

1255
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:30,488
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1256
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:52,974
Hey! Hey!

1257
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:58,228
Hey! Hey, you're goin' the wrong way.

1258
01:38:58,975 --> 01:39:01,899
I said the Nassau County Airport.

1259
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:07,074
Jesus Christ!

1260
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:10,324
Where did you learn to drive?

1261
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:30,048
Slow down! Slow down!

1262
01:39:30,882 --> 01:39:33,226
Down! Here, take this.

1263
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:34,723
Now, keep it steady. Steady!

1264
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:35,803
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1265
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:37,104
Like before.

1266
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:44,733
Look, Silak. No hands.

1267
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:47,778
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

1268
01:39:47,857 --> 01:39:50,610
Don't let go of the wheel! Jesus Christ!

1269
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:56,366
Where's the bloody thing? Get it!

1270
01:39:56,782 --> 01:39:58,955
My God, we're... We're going...

1271
01:40:01,078 --> 01:40:04,002
What's the matter with you?
You... Hey! Hey!

1272
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:07,339
Geronimo!

1273
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:09,302
There he goes.

1274
01:40:11,923 --> 01:40:13,095
Yeah!

1275
01:40:13,132 --> 01:40:15,430
Silak, you're on your own.

1276
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:17,432
Let's go! Come on!

1277
01:40:19,096 --> 01:40:21,849
I don't know how to work this. Oh, my God!

1278
01:40:22,183 --> 01:40:26,313
Hey, can somebody help? Hey, some help!

1279
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:28,280
Oh, God, stay up, now.

1280
01:40:28,397 --> 01:40:30,149
I think it's going down.

1281
01:40:30,233 --> 01:40:31,485
That's not supposed to happen.

1282
01:40:32,818 --> 01:40:34,115
Bluey sprung a leak.

1283
01:40:34,195 --> 01:40:35,788
You said the damn thing would float.

1284
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:36,955
I thought it would.

1285
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:40,827
Grab the bag.

1286
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:44,080
Come on.

1287
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:45,798
All right. Give me the bag.

1288
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:47,170
Here. Take Bluey.

1289
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:48,968
Screw Bluey. Give me the goddamn bag.

1290
01:40:49,961 --> 01:40:51,634
- All right.
- Got it?

1291
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:52,713
Yeah.

1292
01:40:55,675 --> 01:40:57,302
Don't forget me.

1293
01:40:57,343 --> 01:40:58,845
Come on, mate.

1294
01:40:59,345 --> 01:41:00,437
Yeah!

1295
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:04,809
Good on you, Bluey!

1296
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:06,769
Look, look at Silak go.

1297
01:41:06,811 --> 01:41:09,109
I hear it's a bitch
to learn how to fly those things.

1298
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:10,898
He's doin' all right.

1299
01:41:10,982 --> 01:41:11,983
For a clown!

1300
01:41:13,025 --> 01:41:14,652
We got a real problem here, Rollie.

1301
01:41:14,694 --> 01:41:17,743
You know how long it's gonna
take us to dry $10 million?

1302
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:20,578
These are already dry!

1303
01:41:22,243 --> 01:41:24,587
Please tell me those aren't
the real medallions.

1304
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:26,130
They are! I switched them.

1305
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:29,007
Rollie, you dumb bastard.

1306
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:33,091
The mob wasn't stealing 'em.
They were returning 'em to the Vatican!

1307
01:41:36,424 --> 01:41:37,676
Nobody told me.

1308
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:16,885
I wonder if we can find
a decent restaurant in this town.

1309
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:20,218
What do you say we exchange
some of our damp currency

1310
01:42:20,301 --> 01:42:21,427
and we try to find something to eat?

1311
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:23,353
Good idea. What do you fancy?

1312
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:24,980
How about Mexican?

1313
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:28,060
You're all class, Leo, but I promised Kim
and Chris some real Italian pizza.

1314
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,852
Hey, hey, hey,
there's only one city in the world

1315
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:31,237
where you can get a decent pizza.

1316
01:42:31,312 --> 01:42:32,484
Yeah, Sydney.

1317
01:42:32,563 --> 01:42:33,985
Yeah, you're right.

1318
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:37,740
Hey, how about a coin? You want a genuine
coin collection from the Vatican?

1319
01:42:37,777 --> 01:42:40,075
That's the last thing
he needs, mate, coins.

1320
01:42:40,112 --> 01:42:42,786
- Sorry, pal.
- Come on. Next trip. Come on.

1321
01:42:42,865 --> 01:42:45,994
Here we are. Let's get up in this.

1322
01:42:46,077 --> 01:42:49,081
That poor horse. We should be pullin' him.

1323
01:42:49,163 --> 01:42:50,665
Apologize to the horse, mate.

1324
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:16,694
Wait a second. Wait!

1325
01:45:16,727 --> 01:45:20,152
Oh, my God, this... I got it.
