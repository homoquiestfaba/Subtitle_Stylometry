00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:24,058

00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:28,727
from town to town.

Takeyour seats, please.

9
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,372
I just talked with the Cartel.

10
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:50,434
They're concerned that the rumors
are getting out ofcontrol.

11
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:53,378
They'd like to make a statement
in two hours.

12
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:56,713
Some ofyou may not know
we've had another incident.

13
00:02:56,784 --> 00:02:58,843
At 1 520 hours yesterday,
a freight train...

14
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,252
Trans Marineris 74 Yankee...

15

Let's move.

Bring her in, please.

31
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:18,855
Lieutenant Ballard,
please be seated.

32
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:23,503
Do I get a lawyer, or don't police
officers have rights these days?

33
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:26,938
Representation by counsel
won't be necessary.

34
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:29,909
Your rights are protected
by the Matronage.

35
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:31,604
You can speak freely.

36
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:34,341
- Then I'm not being charged?
- Sit down, Lieutenant.

37
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:35,905
This is a discovery hearing...

38
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:39,180
and your presence is required
as ranking officer.

39
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:41,448
I wantyour after-action report.

40
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:44,855
WWhere's the rest ofyour team,
the prisoneryou picked up?

41
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:47,326
WWhat happened at Shining Canyon?

42
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:53,293
Last Friday at 1 750, we were
slamming through a dust storm...

43
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:55,699
on the edge ofthesouthern valley.

44
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:58,902
74 Yankee wasan orehauler...

45
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:01,237

47
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:07,841
You beat me.

48
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,451
- Looks likeyou played tarts before.
- No, I've never done this.

49
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,878
Let's spin 'em again.
One down and one up.

50
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:21,823
Fuck me! The five ofbats.

51
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:24,490
You got the wheel up.
WWhat's yourwager?

52
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:26,658
Five bucks.

53
00:05:33,174 --> 00:05:35,506
Helena? Hey.

54
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:37,339
Sorry.

55
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:40,141
WWeather station's tracking a huge
storm across the southern sector...

56
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,239
and we're right under it by now.

57
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,953
- WWhat's the mark on it?
- 3,200 kliks.

58
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:50,217
WWe should be there by 1 800.

59
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:58,427
Just let me know
ifyou need anything.

60
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:51,910
You high?

61
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,054
Fuck, Helena, it'sjust clear.

62
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:58,114
I'll be straighter than this track
long before we hit the canyon.

63
00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:01,719
You better be. This prisoner
transfer is no sleepwalk.

64
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,425
- WWe're picking upJames WWilliams.
- You mean ''Desolation'' WWilliams?

65
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:08,127
Cooling his heels
in the Shining Canyonjail.

66
00:07:08,202 --> 00:07:10,261
Deep solitary.

67
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:14,069
- WWhat's the charge this time?
- Murder.

68
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:17,838
The man's been up on murder three times.
He gets offevery time on self-defense.

69
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:20,847
It's different this time.
Sounds like he finallywent psycho.

70
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:24,078
Beaucoup corpses, all mutilated.

71
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:27,518
WWilliams shows up at the mine
with some bizarre-ass story.

72
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:31,581
Sends three officers to the medevac
before they locked him down.

73
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,117
- You starting to see the picture?
- And all we got is you, me...

74
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:37,323
and this new guyJericho
and a couple ofrookies?

75
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:39,696
WWhat doyou think
ofSergeantJericho?

76
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:43,168
I was hoping we'd get a good,
solid woman we could count on.

77
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:45,603
I don't know.
I guess we'll see.

78
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:49,470
WWell...

79
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:52,876
I need you straight, Melanie.

80
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:57,008
Don't worry about that,
Commander.

81
00:07:57,084 --> 00:07:59,177
I'm as straight as they come.

82
00:07:59,253 --> 00:08:01,244
Such a shame.

83
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:06,488
Check on
our transfer schedule.

84
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:10,023
Shining Canyon.

85
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:14,295
Shining Canyon,
this is Trans Marineris 74 Yankee.

86
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,665
They ready for us?

87
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:18,569
This storm's really kicking up a mess.
I can't get through to the tower.

88
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,664
Here's your coffee, Mr. McSimms.
Three sugars and two whites.

89
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:23,232
Just the wayyou like it.
You want some?

90
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,744
No, thanks.
How long?

91
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:29,105
About 40.

92
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,048
Shining Canyon.

93
00:08:31,118 --> 00:08:33,746
Shining Canyon, this is
Trans Marineris 74 Yankee.

94
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:35,914
ETA, 40 minutes.

95
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:40,321
Everybody checkyour equipment.
I don't want any surprises.

96
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,756
Is everything all right,
Lieutenant?

97
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:49,098
I couldn't help but notice that charming
little scene with the queen bee.

98
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,764
Yeah, well, you know how
the service is, Sergeant.

99
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,240
She figures ifI want to make captain,
I'll have to pay the price.

100
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:58,176
Thing is, I don't give a damn
about wearing another bar.

101
00:08:58,245 --> 00:09:00,110
It could be that.

102
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:03,378
Or maybe shejust has
good taste in women.

103
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:06,386
Sergeant, you are
seriously out ofline.

104
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:08,513
I'd hate to spoil my record.

105
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:13,083
All right. I knowyou think
you're some pretty tough hombres.

106
00:09:14,628 --> 00:09:17,722
You've had the best training.
You have the best gear.

107
00:09:17,798 --> 00:09:20,733
You probably think this is
some routine prisoner transfer.

108
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:22,598
But that's what I want
to bang intoyour heads.

109
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,865
There's nothing routine
about this prisoner.

110
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,397
WWe are here to pick up
James ''Desolation'' WWilliams.

111
00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:31,274
I wantyou all jack-ready
and double tough.

112
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:56,559
Officers, you can disembark here.

113
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:58,305
WWhat time is departure?

114
00:09:58,372 --> 00:10:00,567
WWe need at least halfan hour
to secure our prisoner.

115
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,233
WWe got about
a four-hour turnaround...

116
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:05,710
and we'll be back
at this spot at about 2200.

117
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,679
You can re-board any time after that.

118
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:10,080
See ifyou can raise
theyard master, will ya?

119
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:14,247
Ed? Ed, you out there?

120
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:15,948
Rookies, useyour breathers.

121
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:19,686
WWe're not gonna have air like Earth
for ten moreyears. Let's go.

122
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:47,112
- God, I hate this thing.
- You'll get used to it.

123
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,453
Twoyears ago, we were still
wearing full-face breathers.

124
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,651
It takes about a month to get over
the headaches out here.

125
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:58,624
So this is Shining Canyon?
God, what a dump.

126
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,691
- First time in the boonies, rookie?
- Standard layout.

127
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:04,067
Just another shitty boomtown
like all the others.

128
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:05,867
Seen one, you can go home.

129
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,908
You're always cold,
you can't get a decent shower...

130
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:10,808
and they don't tell you
that a one-year contract here...

131
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,244
equals twoyears' Earth time.

132
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:15,248
You gotta read the fine print.

133
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:23,422
WWhere is everybody?

134
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:27,494
Yeah. Friday night,
the place should be packed.

135
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,553
A whole 12hoursbeforesunup,
andthere'smoneytoburn...

136
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:34,089
whores to fuck
anddrugs to take.

137
00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:36,227
Instead, wegotagraveyard.

138
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:41,299
Maybe they're all inside,
spending their money.

139
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,070
Mel, I'll get us squared away
at the rec-fac.

140
00:11:43,143 --> 00:11:45,703
You and SergeantJericho
check in at thejail.

141
00:11:47,014 --> 00:11:49,175
Save some hot water for me.

142
00:11:52,353 --> 00:11:54,583
WWhere wereyou before Chryse?

143
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:57,123
Utopia.

144
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,557
It's the arse end ofthe universe.

145
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:02,994
A penal camp full of
work-amnesty cutthroats.

146
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:04,792
Sounds nasty...

147
00:12:04,865 --> 00:12:07,629
butyou seem to be
holding together all right.

148
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:10,169
WWhatyou see is nothing.

149
00:12:10,237 --> 00:12:12,762
I have numerous
hidden talents.

150
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:30,747
Need some help with that?

151
00:12:31,425 --> 00:12:34,223
You're persistent, aren'tyou?

152
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,957
I've changed a few minds
in my time.

153
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:40,228
There's not many
ofus breeders around.

154
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,464
I'd hate to miss a chance
to give it a go.

155
00:12:43,537 --> 00:12:45,334
WWhat doyou say?

156
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:55,840
Hello!

157
00:12:56,684 --> 00:12:58,584
Anybody here?

158
00:13:15,202 --> 00:13:17,295
Officer to front desk.

159
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,612
WWell, hello, Mr. WWilliams.

160
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:37,453
No one seems to be about.
WWhat doyou make ofit?

161
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:38,616
I don't know.

162
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,990
Doyou want me to pop the lock
and ask the prisoners?

163
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:43,825
WWhat doyou mean, pop the lock?
That's a level-eight security door.

164
00:13:44,932 --> 00:13:48,299
I've got a mystical waywith
locks and mechanical objects.

165
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,564
There isn't a machine on Mars
that doesn't love me.

166
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:54,234
How about we checkwith
the commander first?

167
00:13:57,945 --> 00:14:01,745
So what doyou do for fun then?
Areyou a gambler?

168
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:06,411
No. I'm short-time, Sergeant.
I believe in saving my money.

169
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:11,518
Don't worry about that.
I was gonna do it for free.

170
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:14,953
Let me put it this way.

171
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:17,394
Maybe I'd sleep with you
ifyou were the last man on Earth.

172
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:21,124
But we're not on Earth.

173
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:27,534
It's a voltage overload,
most likely.

174
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:30,505
You want to check it out?

175
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:32,204
It's probably nothing.

176
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:35,310
But on second thought--

177
00:15:19,827 --> 00:15:22,295
Police officer.
Anybody there?

178
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:51,254
Shit!

179
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:11,141
- This is not making me happy.
- It's time to get backup.

180
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:46,674
Jesus Christ.
WWhat areyou doing?

181
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:51,644
- I almost killed you.
- WWhat's going on?

182
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:55,381
- Rec-fac's a slaughterhouse.
- WWhat?

183
00:16:55,455 --> 00:16:57,013
Slaughterhouse?

184
00:16:58,025 --> 00:17:02,724
That's the word Descanso used.
I didn't see it myself.

185
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:04,525
According to what
Commander Braddock told me...

186
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:07,158
right afterwe first arrived
in Shining Canyon...

187
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:11,193
she and the two rookies headed
towards the recreation facility.

188
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:13,239
Mel, I'll get us squared away
at the rec-fac.

189
00:17:13,307 --> 00:17:16,003
You and SergeantJericho
go and check in at thejail.

190
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,010
Save some hot water for me.

191
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:44,737
Descanso, sweep left.

192
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,540
Bashira, stickwith me.

193
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:05,925
Officer to train,
doyou read?

194
00:18:06,526 --> 00:18:10,257
The casino, barracks, dining hall,
rec center, no one alive anywhere.

195
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,628
- Commander.
- WWhat?

196
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,972
- I can't reach the train.
- WWell, keep trying.

197
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:26,104
How are we doing?

198
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:29,312
I don't know. This thing
was built to stay locked.

199
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:31,442
And WWilliams
is still locked up?

200
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:33,786
WWhat doyou mean?

201
00:18:33,854 --> 00:18:36,618
WWilliams was arrested
on the suspicion ofmurdering...

202
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,558
six rail workers and a payroll courier
up at Klik 305 Hub Station.

203
00:18:40,627 --> 00:18:44,893
The bodies were hung and decapitated,
just like the bodies in the rec-fac.

204
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:48,095
So how'd they pin that
on Desolation?

205
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,863
He showed up here
with the courier's payroll.

206
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:51,995
The cashier realized
it was a stolen scrip.

207
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:54,063
They made the arrest.

208
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:56,837
There's got to be a day log
here somewhere.

209
00:18:58,145 --> 00:18:59,544
Sergeant's desk.

210
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:10,618
Here.

211
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:16,656
Last night the mine called in
a work stoppage.

212
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,221
Reported winds
gusting up to 60 knots.

213
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:21,324
- Sixty?
- That's what it says.

214
00:19:22,002 --> 00:19:23,469
Anything else?

215
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,472
Arrest for theft, then nothing.

216
00:19:28,842 --> 00:19:30,537
Got it.

217
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:57,565
WWhat's going on around here?

218
00:19:57,637 --> 00:20:01,403
WWe haven't had a meal
or a piss break in six hours.

219
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:03,807
Descanso, open the door.

220
00:20:03,877 --> 00:20:06,175
All right, everybody, answer ''here''
when I call your name.

221
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,873
- Akooshay.
- WWhat?

222
00:20:07,948 --> 00:20:09,540
Just answer ''here.''

223
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:11,345
- Yeah.
- Zimmerman.

224
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,352
I'm right in front ofyou.

225
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,717
Benchley.

226
00:20:16,523 --> 00:20:19,890
- WWho's that?
- She showed up last night.

227
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:24,422
Checked herselfin. Insisted on
being locked up here with us.

228
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:26,466
WWell, wake her up, sunshine.

229
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:28,626
Let's see what she has to say.

230
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:34,033
Somebodywants to talk toyou.

231
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,941
- WWho areyou?
- WWhitlock.

232
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:40,639
WWhat areyou doing
in the holding tank, WWhitlock?

233
00:20:42,182 --> 00:20:44,776
It's the only safe place
at the moment, okay?

234
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:47,081
- Can I go back to sleep now?
- No, you can't!

235
00:20:47,154 --> 00:20:50,453
I need answers.
WWhat's going on out there?

236
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,227
WWhat's your I.D.?

237
00:20:57,597 --> 00:21:01,089
Dr. Arlene WWhitlock.
I'm the Spec Six science officer...

238
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:05,002
in charge ofthe mining operation
at Drucker's Ridge.

239
00:21:05,705 --> 00:21:10,335
I left Drucker's about a week ago
with a weather balloon I'd modified.

240
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,814
There wasa disturbancein town.
Itseemedprudent togetout.

241
00:21:15,882 --> 00:21:18,817
They said there was a riot
and the place was destroyed.

242
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:20,819
Yeah, something like that.

243
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:24,084
I was adrift for several days,
you know.

244
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,988
Ran out offood.

245
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:29,495
Ifollowedtherailroadtracks
untilIgothere.

246
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:31,394
Oh, shit.

247
00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:33,659
Then thestorm forcedme toolow.

248
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,565
Ihita windmillandcrashed.

249
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,184
And theywere kind enough
to take me in here.

250
00:21:53,253 --> 00:21:55,187
WWell, wasn't that nice ofthem.

251
00:21:56,056 --> 00:22:00,049
Mel,Jericho,
go check out WWilliams.

252
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:01,821
See ifhe knows anything
about this.

253
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:12,570
WWilliams, doyou know
what's going on outside?

254
00:22:17,143 --> 00:22:20,044
Areyou aware of
what's going on outside?

255
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,841
Let's go. This asshole
doesn't know anything either.

256
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:42,091
You got some balls, calling him
an asshole to his face.

257
00:22:42,168 --> 00:22:44,102
That's Desolation WWilliams.

258
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,435
I heard he took out at least six when
they cornered him at Deimos Station.

259
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:52,009
And this is eight inches.
You men love to exaggerate.

260
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:53,545
Just goes with the territory.

261
00:22:54,514 --> 00:22:57,608
Yeah, well, in my case,
it's a bit different.

262
00:22:57,684 --> 00:23:01,085
Perhaps a connoisseur likeyourself
would appreciate what I have to offer.

263
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:29,648
Go get the commander.

264
00:24:02,882 --> 00:24:04,816
Disarm her.

265
00:24:15,962 --> 00:24:18,123
Officer.

266
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,568
It wasalmostlikeshe was...

267
00:24:23,636 --> 00:24:26,127
possessed.

268
00:24:26,206 --> 00:24:28,572
Like there was some kind
offorce inside her.

269
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:32,634
- WWho was she?
- She was a dispatch officer.

270
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:35,647
WWe tried to make her comfortable.

271
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:39,276
The rookies took her to a storage
room in the back ofthejail.

272
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,947
Then the commander and I went
back outside to look around town.

273
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:48,724
- WWhat doyou think?
- That the science officer is lying.

274
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:52,526
- Tell me again about WWilliams.
- I didn't read the full file.

275
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,658
Caught him with the money,
but he said he didn't kill anybody.

276
00:24:54,734 --> 00:24:59,228
- Course. They all died offright.
- Then cut their own heads off?

277
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:28,225
Put down yourweapon!
Put it down!

278
00:25:29,936 --> 00:25:31,801
CallJericho.

279
00:25:31,871 --> 00:25:33,702
SergeantJericho,
we need backup!

280
00:25:33,773 --> 00:25:35,764
WWe're 20 southwest
ofthe rec-fac.

281
00:25:35,842 --> 00:25:38,174
Don't open the door!
Don't let it out!

282
00:25:49,022 --> 00:25:50,785
WWho goes there?

283
00:25:56,196 --> 00:25:58,391
I can't fight it!
It's in me!

284
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,936
Commander Braddock!

285
00:26:22,255 --> 00:26:24,246
There's a man in there.
Open it.

286
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,724
The lock is destroyed.
I gonna need a cutting torch.

287
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,491
How long?

288
00:26:31,564 --> 00:26:33,691
At least halfan hour,
maybe more.

289
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,830
WWhat the fuck
is going on here?

290
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:38,996
He committed suicide.

291
00:26:39,072 --> 00:26:40,903
Before he slit his throat,
heyelled something...

292
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,408
something like, ''Stay away!

293
00:26:44,277 --> 00:26:48,338
Don'topen the door.
Stayaway. ''

294
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:51,817
And now
the commander's gone.

295
00:27:04,097 --> 00:27:06,122
Maybe he was contagious.

296
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:10,459
Or crazy.
I don't know.

297
00:27:10,537 --> 00:27:12,664
I saywe take him at his word
and leave him locked in.

298
00:27:15,942 --> 00:27:19,708
Look, one ofus has
to staywith the rookies.

299
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:23,613
WWhy don'tyou go back to thejail?
I'll find the commander.

300
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,413
Let's get the hell
out ofthis place.

301
00:27:26,486 --> 00:27:28,647
There's nothing we can do
for this guy.

302
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,457
You're right.

303
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,516
Okay, let's go.

304
00:27:49,776 --> 00:27:52,472
Drop the weapon before
I cut this dyke bitch head off!.

305
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,206
WWhat the fuck happened?

306
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,077
Bashira let him out
for some food.

307
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:57,912
Let me guess.
You unshackled him.

308
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:03,850
- WWhat doyou want, WWilliams?
- I wanna get the fuck out ofhere.

309
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,819
WWe'll letyou walk.
Just let the girl go.

310
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,831
You think I'm falling for that shit?

311
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,060
I can't letyou take the rookie.

312
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:20,435
Take me, okay?

313
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:29,512
Put the gun down.
Put 'em down!

314
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,110
Dropyour gun, Descanso.

315
00:28:35,188 --> 00:28:37,213
Yeah, drop the gun, Descanso.

316
00:28:49,469 --> 00:28:52,700
Relax! Take it easy!

317
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,036
Just relax, relax.

318
00:28:56,142 --> 00:28:59,543
- You'll get whatyou want.
- I know I'll get everything I want.

319
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,045
Now let's go.

320
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,815
Damn girl,
I likeyou already.

321
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:13,992
Shit.

322
00:29:18,698 --> 00:29:19,892
You okay?

323
00:29:22,101 --> 00:29:24,069
Just swell.

324
00:29:25,371 --> 00:29:28,670
- WWhere's WWilliams?
- He took offout the air lock.

325
00:29:33,246 --> 00:29:34,873
He went into the clinic.

326
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:36,676
I saw him go in
not even two minutes ago.

327
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:38,478
Let me guess.
He's gotyour shotgun, right?

328
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:39,984
Couldn't help it.
He was too fast.

329
00:29:40,053 --> 00:29:41,918
He's still in there though.
I can see the back door from here.

330
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,320
All right,
you two take the back door.

331
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,292
I'll go in front and flush him out.
Ifhe comes atyou, shoot to kill.

332
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:34,793
Now what?

333
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:47,704
How the hell did that happen?

334
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,442
- Let's go.
- WWait a minute.

335
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,880
Looks likeyou're
coming with me now.

336
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:56,752
You see what's going on out there.
You know I didn't kill nobody.

337
00:31:56,823 --> 00:32:00,623
- I said move it.
- I ain't going nowhere.

338
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:03,321
I just saved your life.
You should let me go.

339
00:32:03,396 --> 00:32:05,921
And I saved yours.
Looks like we're even.

340
00:32:06,699 --> 00:32:09,259
Now move it!

341
00:32:38,097 --> 00:32:40,031
Let me askyou something.

342
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:43,830
Ifyou're so innocent, how come we
found all that stolen flash on you?

343
00:32:44,971 --> 00:32:47,462
I didn't say I was innocent.

344
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,599
I said I didn't kill nobody.

345
00:32:50,743 --> 00:32:53,337
Okay, let's say I believeyou.

346
00:32:53,412 --> 00:32:56,074
WWhat exactly happened
at K-305?

347
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:58,048
I don't know.

348
00:32:58,117 --> 00:33:00,950
I wasjust changing trains
from Camp Sinai.

349
00:33:02,288 --> 00:33:05,451
Hadalittle time
togetmesomething to eat...

350
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,720
so I wentinto thestation.

351
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,966
It wasjustlying there,
soyou tookit.

352
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:51,162
You would have done
the same thing.

353
00:33:54,473 --> 00:33:57,670
See, that's whereyou're wrong.

354
00:33:57,743 --> 00:34:00,712
I'm a cop, not a crook.

355
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,717
It's a thin line between
a cop and a crook these days.

356
00:34:05,785 --> 00:34:07,878
You think it's a big difference
between you and me?

357
00:34:07,954 --> 00:34:11,014
Youjust got the woman
behind your bullshit.

358
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:15,553
Look atyou.
You look high right now.

359
00:34:19,198 --> 00:34:22,099
You know
I saved your life out there.

360
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:25,467
So why don'tyou save mine
and let me out ofhere?

361
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,073
Look...

362
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,406
myjob is to bring you back
to Chryse to stand trial.

363
00:34:34,413 --> 00:34:36,540
I don't thinkyou did it.

364
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,641
But that's not my call.

365
00:34:39,785 --> 00:34:42,253
So let's not make this any more
complicated than it has to be.

366
00:34:44,857 --> 00:34:47,223
Yeah, it's gonna be
real complicated.

367
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,090
You can believe that shit!

368
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,822
I ain't going back!

369
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,367
Soyou secured your prisoner.

370
00:34:57,436 --> 00:34:59,836
WWhere was your commanding
officer during this time?

371
00:34:59,905 --> 00:35:03,705
I can only report what
SergeantJericho told me later.

372
00:35:03,776 --> 00:35:05,539
After the man in the Rover
committed suicide...

373
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:07,909
Jericho went looking
for the commander.

374
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,039
Let's get the hell
out ofthis place.

375
00:35:10,116 --> 00:35:13,483
There's nothing we can do
for this guy.

376
00:35:13,552 --> 00:35:17,352
Yeah, you're right.
Let's go.

377
00:35:24,964 --> 00:35:26,898
Commander Braddock!

378
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,108
Lieutenant,
we got a situation here.

379
00:37:58,884 --> 00:38:01,819
Sergeant, you're breaking up.
I can hardly hearyou.

380
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:03,986
The commander's dead.

381
00:38:05,858 --> 00:38:08,122
Everybodyin themine
hasgoneinsane.

382
00:38:10,963 --> 00:38:12,931
Jericho, can you read?

383
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:23,072
Hey, come on!
Let us out ofhere!

384
00:38:23,142 --> 00:38:25,133
Start at the beginning!

385
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:29,914
- I told you. I got here last night.
- Don't bullshit me!

386
00:38:29,982 --> 00:38:31,574
Lieutenant!

387
00:38:36,722 --> 00:38:39,190
WWhat the hell is going on
out there?

388
00:38:42,595 --> 00:38:44,119
WWhat?

389
00:38:46,065 --> 00:38:49,523
In semiarid regions on Earth,
there are certain organisms...

390
00:38:49,602 --> 00:38:52,628
that live in small pools
that are formed by the annual rains.

391
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,299
WWhen the pools dry up,
those organisms can't live.

392
00:38:55,374 --> 00:39:00,038
But they don't die either.
They go dormant below the surface...

393
00:39:00,112 --> 00:39:04,572
away from the hot sun
until the next rain cycle begins.

394
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,914
Then they reemerge.

395
00:39:06,986 --> 00:39:08,783
I think something like that
is happening here.

396
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:10,719
I don't understand.

397
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:13,724
WWhatever used to live here,
we woke it up.

398
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:16,192
It takes us, okay?

399
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:19,060
I'm talking about
a kind ofpossession.

400
00:39:19,131 --> 00:39:21,531
Lieutenant, SergeantJericho
is on the radio.

401
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,625
He said he found
three people out there.

402
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:26,694
They're on theirway in and
they got an ETA offive minutes.

403
00:39:26,772 --> 00:39:28,797
You should get on the radio
and talk to him.

404
00:39:28,874 --> 00:39:32,207
- He's found three people?
- That's what he said.

405
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,922
- You okay?
- No.

406
00:39:50,996 --> 00:39:52,964
Something broken?

407
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:58,370
I'm all right.

408
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,803
But it's out ofthe body now.

409
00:40:00,873 --> 00:40:03,205
Yeah, it's loose in here.

410
00:40:05,844 --> 00:40:07,903
Lieutenant,
sergeant's on the radio.

411
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:27,591
Lieutenant, we're coming in.
Canyoureadme?

412
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:31,602
- Sergeant, where areyou?
- We're rightdown thestreet.

413
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,638
WWe? WWho's we?

414
00:40:33,706 --> 00:40:37,233
Ifoundthreepeoplealive outhere.
Come on. Open the doorforus.

415
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:57,391
I tried to reach you on the radio.
Justyou make sure that door is locked.

416
00:40:57,463 --> 00:40:59,090
There must be
200 ofthem fucking freaks...

417
00:40:59,164 --> 00:41:02,531
and any minute now
they'll be coming to kick our ass.

418
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:07,197
Okay, relax.
WWho are these guys?

419
00:41:07,272 --> 00:41:09,934
I found them hiding
up in the mine shed.

420
00:41:17,082 --> 00:41:20,950
Lieutenant,
we got a situation here.

421
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,511
Sergeant, you'rebreaking up.
Icanhardlyhearyou.

422
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,054
The commander's dead.

423
00:41:28,193 --> 00:41:31,185
And everybody in the mine
has gone insane.

424
00:41:49,982 --> 00:41:51,916
Check the window!

425
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:04,386
They didn't see him.
They're gone.

426
00:42:04,463 --> 00:42:08,160
- WWho areyou?
- WWho are we? WWho areyou?

427
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:12,533
- The man asked you a question.
- My name'sJericho.

428
00:42:12,604 --> 00:42:15,004
At least he's not one ofthem.

429
00:42:16,308 --> 00:42:20,745
WWhat's happening out there?
WWho the fuck are those clowns?

430
00:42:20,813 --> 00:42:22,713
WWhat are they
all sparked up about?

431
00:42:22,781 --> 00:42:24,749
Used to be miners.

432
00:42:24,817 --> 00:42:27,217
Then everybody
in this place lost their mind.

433
00:42:27,286 --> 00:42:29,914
Running around,
chopping people's heads off.

434
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,247
Ease up, man.

435
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:42,499
WWe were up on the rim
when they called a work stoppage.

436
00:42:47,673 --> 00:42:50,574
- WWhat are they doing?
- Shit, I don't know.

437
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,304
Look at that. They're
knocking offearly for the night.

438
00:42:54,379 --> 00:42:57,246
How will we sneak in on a shift change
ifthey knock offearly for the night?

439
00:42:57,316 --> 00:43:00,080
Shut up!
WWhat the hell is that?

440
00:43:05,524 --> 00:43:07,492
Let's get the hell out ofhere!

441
00:43:09,928 --> 00:43:12,590
WWe hid till the storm was over.

442
00:43:12,664 --> 00:43:15,929
Later, I went out
to take a look around.

443
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:19,334
I thought they wereall dead.

444
00:43:19,404 --> 00:43:22,965
Thensome ofthem
startedto come to.

445
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:28,809
They walkedaround
like they were confusedorlost.

446
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:31,406
A fewofthemseemedokay.

447
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,110
They was trying
tohelp the others.

448
00:43:34,186 --> 00:43:37,519
- Then they started changing.
- WWhat doyou mean?

449
00:43:38,624 --> 00:43:41,616
They act different,
stand different.

450
00:43:41,693 --> 00:43:45,026
Start cutting on themselves
for decoration.

451
00:43:45,097 --> 00:43:46,530
Filing their teeth.

452
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:49,699
Making weapons.

453
00:43:51,904 --> 00:43:54,372
Killing the ones
whohadn'tchanged.

454
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:03,513
Cuttingpeople's faces off
andwearing them formasks.

455
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:14,418
You lads got anyweapons?

456
00:44:15,928 --> 00:44:17,759
I mean real weapons.

457
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:20,593
Only cops can have guns.

458
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:22,896
There's some detonators
in them cases over there.

459
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:28,070
Doyou know
how these things work?

460
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,802
I knowyou need dynamite
to use them.

461
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,969
Okay, then.

462
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,979
WWe take our prisoner
and we all get on the train.

463
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,311
And what prisonerwould that be?

464
00:44:37,382 --> 00:44:39,350
That doesn't concern you.

465
00:44:39,418 --> 00:44:41,283
Ifit's Desolation WWilliams...

466
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,480
it concerns me very much.

467
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,183
Now dropyourweapon.

468
00:44:52,464 --> 00:44:55,831
All ofyou!
WWeapons on the floor.

469
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:08,679
So only cops have guns, eh?
You fucking pricks.

470
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:12,183
WWe lied.
Now go get WWilliams.

471
00:45:13,652 --> 00:45:15,586
I don't think so.

472
00:45:17,222 --> 00:45:19,588
WWhat was that?

473
00:45:19,658 --> 00:45:22,491
- Fucking kill me.
- No problem.

474
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:25,724
Look, will you two
stop fucking about?

475
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,236
Lieutenant, let WWilliams out.

476
00:45:32,304 --> 00:45:33,794
Give me one good reason.

477
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:36,871
I just gaveyou
about 200 good reasons...

478
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,206
and they're probably outside
right now.

479
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,212
It doesn't matter that WWilliams
is wanted for murder...

480
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,908
and it doesn't matter
that this lot are scumbags.

481
00:45:43,982 --> 00:45:48,214
WWhat matters right now is that
we stick together to get out ofhere.

482
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,549
All ofus...

483
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:53,785
including WWilliams,
including them.

484
00:45:54,593 --> 00:45:58,324
WWho areyou calling scumbag,
motherfucker?

485
00:45:59,564 --> 00:46:03,091
Now quit with all your fucking
stalling and take us to WWilliams!

486
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:08,765
I'll be goddamn.

487
00:46:11,343 --> 00:46:12,503
Finally.

488
00:46:12,577 --> 00:46:15,637
Man, this town done went crazy.

489
00:46:15,714 --> 00:46:18,376
WWe had to improvise.
You like it?

490
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:19,917
I love it.

491
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,919
I wantyou to let him out.

492
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,792
WWhat's up, D?

493
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,727
I'm still shackled.

494
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,360
WWhat, areyou pigs on a fucking break?
Free him up.

495
00:46:42,107 --> 00:46:44,871
I knewyou'd let me go.

496
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,741
- It's been a long time.
- I didn't thinky'all could do it.

497
00:46:51,817 --> 00:46:53,307
Piece ofcake.

498
00:46:53,385 --> 00:46:55,683
It was my plan, Desolation.

499
00:46:57,289 --> 00:46:58,779
Fuck!

500
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,417
- I thoughtyou was watching the door.
- I was!

501
00:47:01,493 --> 00:47:04,326
- Bitch, you better open this door.
- I don't think so.

502
00:47:04,396 --> 00:47:08,127
You don't open that door,
I'm gonna blowyour head off.

503
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,896
Then your asses will never get out.

504
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:12,527
Someone will find you sometime...

505
00:47:12,604 --> 00:47:15,630
probably tied upside down in here
with your heads cut off.

506
00:47:16,742 --> 00:47:19,233
Tell your dogs to quit barking
so we can talk.

507
00:47:22,314 --> 00:47:24,407
Put 'em down.

508
00:47:26,752 --> 00:47:28,686
Put it down.

509
00:47:30,422 --> 00:47:32,788
Listen to me, WWilliams.

510
00:47:32,858 --> 00:47:35,258
WWe don't have a lot oftime.

511
00:47:35,327 --> 00:47:38,524
You need us and we need you.

512
00:47:38,597 --> 00:47:40,326
WWe've all seen
what's going on out there...

513
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,266
and none ofus is gonna survive
ifwe don't stick together.

514
00:47:43,335 --> 00:47:45,803
I need you to give me
yourword...

515
00:47:45,871 --> 00:47:47,771
that ifI open this door...

516
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:51,331
you and your boys will stand by
my command at all times.

517
00:47:53,278 --> 00:47:55,212
I never give myword.

518
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,748
It's okay.

519
00:47:57,816 --> 00:47:59,784
I never make deals
with criminals either.

520
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:06,387
- You got it.
- WWhat?

521
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:09,451
You making deals with cops?

522
00:48:09,528 --> 00:48:12,861
And you are too.
Give heryourweapon.

523
00:48:14,299 --> 00:48:16,233
Everybody, give it up.

524
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,581
WWell, introduce us
toyour friends.

525
00:48:33,652 --> 00:48:36,143
These my compadres.

526
00:48:41,593 --> 00:48:43,527
Uno must be the nice one.

527
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,557
You got that right, Butchy.

528
00:48:47,632 --> 00:48:49,600
I'm not as nice as Desolation.

529
00:48:49,668 --> 00:48:52,501
And I'll cut
your fucking titties off.

530
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:55,199
WWho's in charge here?

531
00:48:55,273 --> 00:48:56,706
You better let go ofmy arm.

532
00:48:56,775 --> 00:48:58,265
WWho is in charge here?

533
00:48:58,343 --> 00:49:00,436
You! You!

534
00:49:03,782 --> 00:49:04,714
Shit!

535
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,886
So, youjust gonna stand there
and watch her break my shit.

536
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,120
Yeah.

537
00:49:16,194 --> 00:49:19,960
And now thatyou're done mopping
the floor, get me a beer, killer.

538
00:49:20,031 --> 00:49:21,259
WWhat's next?

539
00:49:22,067 --> 00:49:23,625
WWe get more deputies.

540
00:49:27,305 --> 00:49:29,569
You're deputized.

541
00:49:29,641 --> 00:49:31,700
Consider this
a martial law situation.

542
00:49:32,544 --> 00:49:33,977
Let's go.

543
00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:43,116
WWhen did this start?

544
00:49:44,589 --> 00:49:47,581
It started a few minutes ago.

545
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:51,151
- WWhat should we do with him?
- WWe can't take him with us.

546
00:49:51,229 --> 00:49:53,424
Then here he stays.

547
00:50:26,598 --> 00:50:29,123
Guys, what is that?

548
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,189
It's a Laffer.

549
00:50:30,268 --> 00:50:32,793
A black-market breather.

550
00:50:32,871 --> 00:50:35,305
It has a 1 5 percent
nitrous mix.

551
00:50:35,373 --> 00:50:37,807
It gets you high?

552
00:50:37,876 --> 00:50:40,174
It turns your brain
into Swiss cheese.

553
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:48,944
- One gross ofdetonators.
- WWhat are those good for?

554
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,614
It would help
ifwe had some dynamite...

555
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,624
but they make
a pretty good bang.

556
00:50:53,692 --> 00:50:57,492
WWe could put them in some food cans
or something, make some hand grenades.

557
00:50:57,562 --> 00:51:00,030
All right.
You got ten minutes.

558
00:51:05,236 --> 00:51:07,602
Easy.

559
00:51:07,672 --> 00:51:09,606
Here. Let me do it.

560
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,163
That's beautiful.

561
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,864
That's whatyou get, dumb-ass.

562
00:51:42,674 --> 00:51:44,608
You're gonna be okay
to do this?

563
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,941
All right,
it's almost 2200 hours.

564
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,011
Here's the plan,
short and simple.

565
00:51:57,088 --> 00:52:00,251
Descanso andJericho take the lead.
Everybody else follows.

566
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,486
It's about 50 meters
from here to the station.

567
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,118
Bashira and I are in the rear.

568
00:52:04,195 --> 00:52:06,060
Any questions?

569
00:52:10,969 --> 00:52:12,903
Putyour hand down.

570
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,511
All clear.

571
00:52:27,585 --> 00:52:29,519
Let's do it!

572
00:52:43,601 --> 00:52:46,399
Hey, bro, I don't see
no motherfucking train.

573
00:52:47,472 --> 00:52:48,632
Hey, lady.

574
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,334
WWe don't see no train.

575
00:52:52,911 --> 00:52:53,843
It'll be here.

576
00:52:54,946 --> 00:52:56,504
Come on. Let's go.

577
00:53:06,791 --> 00:53:07,758
That's the mine office.

578
00:53:12,797 --> 00:53:14,287
WWhat are they doing?

579
00:53:14,365 --> 00:53:17,198
Looks like they're tearing the whole
town apart, building by building.

580
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,004
Come on. Pick it up.

581
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:31,614
Lieutenant.

582
00:53:33,384 --> 00:53:35,852
Hold your fire.
Just keep on moving.

583
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:42,286
Go!

584
00:53:54,038 --> 00:53:55,972
- WWhere's the train?
- I don't know.

585
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,201
You don't know? WWhat the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

586
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,210
Lieutenant Ballard to the train,
come in.

587
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:03,042
Plan A is fucked up.
You got a plan B?

588
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:05,446
Yeah. It's the same as plan A.

589
00:54:05,517 --> 00:54:08,247
You got any fresh ideas?

590
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,514
Yeah. WWhat we should have done
in the first place.

591
00:54:12,157 --> 00:54:13,522
Shit!

592
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,783
Come on,
you mindless motherfuckers!

593
00:54:57,001 --> 00:54:59,765
- Second time I saved your life.
- Run a tab.

594
00:55:31,336 --> 00:55:33,270
Jericho, grenade!

595
00:56:19,684 --> 00:56:21,618
Come on, man. On your feet.
Let's move.

596
00:56:24,722 --> 00:56:25,654
Shit.

597
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:01,891
Open that door.

598
00:57:15,406 --> 00:57:19,536
WWe sealed the air lock doors, and
SergeantJericho dismantled the lock.

599
00:57:20,445 --> 00:57:23,972
They couldn't open the door
from the outside, so we were safe...

600
00:57:24,048 --> 00:57:25,481
for a while.

601
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,586
Get on the radio.
Try to reach the train.

602
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,023
WWhere's your brother?

603
00:57:37,195 --> 00:57:39,789
- He didn't make it.
- Oh, God.

604
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,776
Uno was your brother?

605
00:57:54,278 --> 00:57:55,438
Yeah.

606
00:58:35,486 --> 00:58:37,113
Look at him.

607
00:58:37,188 --> 00:58:40,282
WWhatever is inside ofhim
has waited a long time to get out.

608
00:58:41,092 --> 00:58:44,391
I didn't understand their design,
how they move.

609
00:58:44,462 --> 00:58:45,986
But it's got to be the wind.

610
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,861
Yeah.

611
00:58:47,932 --> 00:58:49,490
Yeah, the wind takes them.

612
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,398
And then once their hosts die...

613
00:58:51,469 --> 00:58:55,496
they drift along the railroad tracks
from town to town, human to human.

614
00:58:56,507 --> 00:58:59,135
WWhat a perfect creation.

615
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:02,304
Vengeance on anything or anyone that
tries to lay claim to their planet.

616
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:10,280
WWhat did you see
at Drucker's Ridge?

617
00:59:16,194 --> 00:59:19,129
I was at the mine when
they called a work stoppage.

618
00:59:20,264 --> 00:59:23,961
It was a Section 740,
a ''scientifically significant find.''

619
00:59:37,882 --> 00:59:41,409
A 740applies toanynumber
ofthings foundon Mars.

620
00:59:41,486 --> 00:59:45,479
A biologicalorganism, anindication
ofwater, things like that.

621
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:53,727
After we dynamitedthemountain,
we discoveredan entrance.

622
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:57,165
It wasa tunnel
carvedinto therock.

623
00:59:57,235 --> 01:00:00,102
Ithadbeenhidden underneath
the outer walls forcenturies...

624
01:00:00,171 --> 01:00:03,607
andsomeone otherthanman
hadcarvedit.

625
01:00:54,892 --> 01:00:56,553
Jesus!

626
01:00:59,297 --> 01:01:02,198
- WWhat the hell was that?
- I don't know.

627
01:01:13,177 --> 01:01:15,111
Let's get the hell
out ofhere!

628
01:01:30,261 --> 01:01:32,627
It was me.

629
01:01:32,697 --> 01:01:35,689
I opened Pandora's box.
I let them out.

630
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,892
I contacted the train.

631
01:01:37,969 --> 01:01:40,563
They're about three kliks north oftown
on a decoupling spur.

632
01:01:40,638 --> 01:01:42,697
- They said the tracks are blocked.
- Can they get through?

633
01:01:42,773 --> 01:01:44,934
Yeah, they're working on it.

634
01:01:50,982 --> 01:01:52,882
- You okay?
- Yes.

635
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,384
- Barricaded the rear door.
- Good.

636
01:01:55,453 --> 01:01:58,547
There's a maintenance courtyard out
the back enclosed by a five-meterwall.

637
01:01:58,623 --> 01:02:01,057
There's even
a Rover parked out there.

638
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:03,650
Maybe we can make
a run for it.

639
01:02:03,728 --> 01:02:05,821
No, we wait.

640
01:02:05,896 --> 01:02:08,456
Bashira got in touch with the train.
They're coming back for us.

641
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:24,505
WWell, ifa train comin',
they better hurry up.

642
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,991
WWhat's the matterwith you?
You did good out there.

643
01:02:38,329 --> 01:02:40,354
Yeah, right.

644
01:02:41,032 --> 01:02:43,125
It's a fucked-up situation.

645
01:02:44,535 --> 01:02:47,060
I never put too much faith in cops,
butyou did all right.

646
01:02:51,342 --> 01:02:52,536
You trust me?

647
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:54,407
Hell, no.

648
01:02:54,478 --> 01:02:57,447
I really don't understand you
at all, Desolation.

649
01:02:58,215 --> 01:03:00,376
The only one looking out
for me is me.

650
01:03:00,451 --> 01:03:02,009
Doesn't that botheryou?

651
01:03:02,086 --> 01:03:04,111
Nothing bothers me.

652
01:03:06,457 --> 01:03:08,687
I stopped worrying
a long time ago.

653
01:03:08,759 --> 01:03:10,920
Don'tyou believe in anything?

654
01:03:14,432 --> 01:03:16,525
I believe in staying alive.

655
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,625
Yeah, but forwhat?

656
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:22,699
Stick around.
I might letyou know one day.

657
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:25,307
WWhen?

658
01:03:26,277 --> 01:03:29,371
WWhen the tide is high
and the water's rising.

659
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,423
Doing okay in here?

660
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,662
Check this out.

661
01:04:03,681 --> 01:04:06,878
- WWhat about it?
- It's pretty solid.

662
01:04:06,951 --> 01:04:10,352
One way in and a back door out,
leading to the rear entrance.

663
01:04:16,193 --> 01:04:19,924
- A good sturdy door.
- So what's your point?

664
01:04:19,997 --> 01:04:23,660
It's rather cozy,
don'tyou think?

665
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:29,098
I don't believe this.

666
01:04:29,173 --> 01:04:31,107
You lured me back here
to seduce me?

667
01:04:31,175 --> 01:04:34,838
Yeah, well, the way
things are going...

668
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:37,904
I thought this might be
our last chance to--

669
01:04:37,982 --> 01:04:39,176
to dance.

670
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,053
Yeah.

671
01:04:57,401 --> 01:04:59,892
Fuck him,
whatever the fuck he is.

672
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:11,047
It's out ofhim.

673
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:14,641
Everyone go! Get out!

674
01:05:17,721 --> 01:05:19,951
Let's take her out back.

675
01:05:20,024 --> 01:05:22,219
WWhat the fuck doyou mean?

676
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,817
WWe aren't moving her anywhere.

677
01:05:23,894 --> 01:05:27,694
It's taking her over, man.
There's nothing we can do.

678
01:05:27,765 --> 01:05:29,232
Easy, man.

679
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,360
I lost a brother in this.
That's not her.

680
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,740
Come on.

681
01:05:47,751 --> 01:05:49,742
Let's put her down
before they hear us.

682
01:05:56,627 --> 01:05:58,561
This belongs to her.

683
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:02,030
- WWhere did you get it?
- I stole it.

684
01:06:02,867 --> 01:06:05,131
Doyou know what it is?

685
01:06:05,202 --> 01:06:06,533
It's her stash.

686
01:06:07,471 --> 01:06:10,099
This will mess
with anything in there.

687
01:06:14,078 --> 01:06:15,943
Bon voyage, Mel.

688
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,947
Let's get the hell back in here.

689
01:07:39,296 --> 01:07:41,230
I will not.

690
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,214
I wasaware ofhaving...

691
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:01,050
thoughts...

692
01:08:02,653 --> 01:08:03,984
or memories.

693
01:08:04,555 --> 01:08:07,319
Like I'd been invaded
by something...

694
01:08:07,391 --> 01:08:10,224
and it was trying
to take me over.

695
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:13,855
Something inside ofme wouldn't let that
other thing take over and I fought it.

696
01:08:13,931 --> 01:08:17,162
I didn't know where I was at first,
and then it hit me.

697
01:08:17,234 --> 01:08:18,724
I was outside alone...

698
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:21,703
unarmed.

699
01:09:48,025 --> 01:09:49,959
The backwall's been breached.

700
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:57,333
Don't worry.
The back door's locked and secured.

701
01:09:58,869 --> 01:10:01,235
Letmein.

702
01:10:01,305 --> 01:10:03,637
It'sme.

703
01:10:03,707 --> 01:10:05,834
Shit!It's Melanie!
Open the door!

704
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:08,173
Looks like her to me.

705
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:10,213
I haven't heard any of
these things speaking English.

706
01:10:11,682 --> 01:10:13,809
Come on, Williams. The tide's
gettinghigh outhere.

707
01:10:13,884 --> 01:10:16,011
Give me those keys.

708
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:17,383
Come on!

709
01:10:22,126 --> 01:10:23,650
Is ityou?

710
01:10:24,895 --> 01:10:26,328
Yes.

711
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,198
It's me.

712
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,364
I had a glimpse
ofthe Martians...

713
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:42,708
oftheir minds,
ofwhat theywant.

714
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:46,580
Theywon't rest short ofthe
destruction ofany invading species.

715
01:10:47,885 --> 01:10:50,479
As far as they're concerned,
we are the invaders.

716
01:10:52,923 --> 01:10:54,857
Something's kicking out there.

717
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,068
Shit. They made
a battering ram.

718
01:11:05,135 --> 01:11:07,603
Everybody to the rear
ofthejail.

719
01:11:07,671 --> 01:11:09,605
Bashira, you andJericho
go back to the storeroom.

720
01:11:09,673 --> 01:11:11,937
Load up on detonators.
You're the second line ofdefense.

721
01:11:12,009 --> 01:11:12,941
WWe stay here?

722
01:11:13,744 --> 01:11:16,542
WWe hold them offas long as we can,
then we fall back to the storeroom.

723
01:11:16,613 --> 01:11:20,549
Soon as we kill one ofthem, whatever
is inside is gonna come after us.

724
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:22,911
I know.

725
01:11:22,986 --> 01:11:24,920
So ifone ofus gets possessed--

726
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:26,421
Leave 'em.

727
01:12:07,064 --> 01:12:09,828
Here we go. Party time.

728
01:12:44,101 --> 01:12:45,500
- I'm out.
- I'm out.

729
01:12:52,209 --> 01:12:54,370
- Clear!
- Move! Move!

730
01:13:02,552 --> 01:13:03,678
Clear!

731
01:13:13,864 --> 01:13:15,491
- Clear! Clear!
- Stand clear!

732
01:13:23,206 --> 01:13:24,901
- Clear!
- Get out!

733
01:13:38,722 --> 01:13:40,713
- I got it.
- Take them out back.

734
01:13:43,927 --> 01:13:45,258
Get out ofhere.

735
01:14:37,447 --> 01:14:38,914
Come on!

736
01:14:38,982 --> 01:14:40,916
Come on! Let's go!

737
01:15:01,805 --> 01:15:03,773
Look for the train. See ifyou
can get someone on the radio.

738
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,775
Jericho, get this thing started.
WWhitlock, unlock the gate.

739
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:16,986
Come on! Hurry up!

740
01:15:20,424 --> 01:15:22,119
The train's at the station.

741
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:26,086
- Officer to train, doyou read?
- WWhere the hell haveyou been?

742
01:15:26,163 --> 01:15:29,326
- WWhere the hell haveyou been?
- All right, Bashira, come down.

743
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:31,924
All right, wait for us.
WWe're on ourway.

744
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:34,803
Let's go.

745
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:41,342
Get in!

746
01:16:24,488 --> 01:16:26,080
Getyourselves ready.

747
01:16:26,823 --> 01:16:27,755
Oh, my.

748
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:36,565
Come on!

749
01:16:36,633 --> 01:16:39,124
Come on! Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

750
01:16:40,203 --> 01:16:42,364
Come on!

751
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:44,373
Okay, go! Go!

752
01:16:51,047 --> 01:16:52,446
WWhat the hell happened toyou?

753
01:16:52,516 --> 01:16:54,780
WWe got trapped a couple ofkliks
north ofhere, trying to off-load.

754
01:16:54,851 --> 01:16:56,182
I'll get us out ofhere.

755
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:13,268
WWe've got to go back.

756
01:17:13,336 --> 01:17:16,362
Slow the train down outside oftown,
then come to a complete stop.

757
01:17:18,475 --> 01:17:19,908
No way.

758
01:17:21,111 --> 01:17:24,979
- I'm giving you an order.
- I don't care. The answer's no.

759
01:17:28,218 --> 01:17:30,152
The answer's yes.

760
01:17:31,655 --> 01:17:33,486
Look...

761
01:17:33,557 --> 01:17:38,995
even ifwe get back to Chryse,
those things will just keep coming.

762
01:17:39,062 --> 01:17:40,996
WWe've got a chance here.

763
01:17:42,499 --> 01:17:45,297
WWe've got a chance to stop this thing
before it goes any further.

764
01:17:45,902 --> 01:17:48,462
This is about one thing--

765
01:17:48,538 --> 01:17:49,971
dominion.

766
01:17:51,341 --> 01:17:53,332
It's not their planet anymore.

767
01:17:54,244 --> 01:17:55,836
WWhat about him?

768
01:17:55,912 --> 01:17:58,437
Isn't it ourjob
to take him back?

769
01:18:00,817 --> 01:18:03,411
Is he still a prisoner
or is he one ofus?

770
01:18:05,155 --> 01:18:07,885
I can give a damn
about saving this planet.

771
01:18:08,992 --> 01:18:12,189
Seems like it's been after me
since the day I was born.

772
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:16,862
IfI'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die fighting...

773
01:18:16,933 --> 01:18:18,764
not running.

774
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:35,710
Ifwe blew up the nuclear
power station, what would happen?

775
01:18:35,785 --> 01:18:37,912
I mean, there'd be
a huge explosion, right?

776
01:18:37,988 --> 01:18:41,219
No, not unless you retract
the control rods and expose the core.

777
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:42,724
Then what?

778
01:18:44,227 --> 01:18:47,663
Then you'd have a small
atomic bomb going ''boom.''

779
01:18:49,766 --> 01:18:50,698
How small?

780
01:18:52,435 --> 01:18:55,700
I don't know. It'd blow out
a radius ofa mile, maybe two.

781
01:19:00,243 --> 01:19:01,642
WWould it kill them?

782
01:19:01,711 --> 01:19:04,179
It would certainly destroy
their human hosts, but as for them...

783
01:19:05,482 --> 01:19:06,642
I don't know.

784
01:19:10,487 --> 01:19:12,751
Jericho, can you get us in?

785
01:19:14,491 --> 01:19:15,924
I can try.

786
01:19:31,975 --> 01:19:33,840
Theplan wassimple.

787
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:36,743
SergeantJericho, thescience officer
andIjumpedoffthe train...

788
01:19:36,813 --> 01:19:39,043
andheadedtowards
thepowerplant.

789
01:19:39,115 --> 01:19:42,778
The othersstayedaboard the train
asitbackedinto thestation.

790
01:19:42,852 --> 01:19:44,786
Theidea was theyprovide cover...

791
01:19:44,854 --> 01:19:48,551
anddistract the Martians
as weset the charges in theplant.

792
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:50,752
They they'dswingback, pick us up
andwe'dallgetas faraway...

793
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:53,057
from Shining Canyonas we could
before theplaceblew.

794
01:19:53,129 --> 01:19:55,597
Like I said,
it was a simple plan.

795
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:59,294
The only problem was, it didn't work
the way it was supposed to.

796
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:09,870
- How areyou doing,Jericho?
- I'm working on it.

797
01:20:09,946 --> 01:20:11,106
Hurry up.

798
01:20:26,396 --> 01:20:30,162
WWe've got to remove the waterjacket
and destroy the containment shell.

799
01:20:30,233 --> 01:20:31,757
WWhere do I put the dynamite?

800
01:20:47,951 --> 01:20:51,785
Officer to the train, they've
spotted us. Getyour ass back here now.

801
01:21:56,085 --> 01:21:57,177
Yeah?

802
01:22:38,862 --> 01:22:40,295
Let's go.

803
01:23:27,677 --> 01:23:29,110
WWe've got to get out
ofhere fast.

804
01:23:29,178 --> 01:23:31,738
The Doc says the blast radius
could be up to two miles.

805
01:23:31,814 --> 01:23:34,078
- WWhat does that mean?
- It means step on it.

806
01:23:55,738 --> 01:23:57,672
Stay here and keep it
full throttle.

807
01:23:57,740 --> 01:23:59,105
WWhat areyou gonna do?

808
01:23:59,175 --> 01:24:00,938
Lighten our load.

809
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:06,171
I think there's some
more dynamite in the rear car.

810
01:26:30,426 --> 01:26:32,690
Seeyou later,
you big motherfucker.

811
01:27:03,226 --> 01:27:04,386
You okay?

812
01:27:05,194 --> 01:27:06,126
Sayyour prayers.

813
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:44,163
I didn't know
you was cut this deep.

814
01:27:45,334 --> 01:27:48,531
Should've taken care
ofthis hours ago.

815
01:27:49,205 --> 01:27:51,673
You do that like a pro.

816
01:27:51,741 --> 01:27:53,106
Yeah.

817
01:27:53,176 --> 01:27:55,667
Me and my brother
been through a lot ofbattles...

818
01:27:56,946 --> 01:27:58,971
ever since we was kids.

819
01:28:02,351 --> 01:28:05,218
I never thought I'd go to war
with somebody likeyou.

820
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:10,353
I know when you get to Chryse, you'll
tell those people that I helped you...

821
01:28:11,427 --> 01:28:14,123
and I wasn't the cause
ofall this mess around here.

822
01:28:15,298 --> 01:28:18,358
'Cause I know they're looking
for somebody to blame.

823
01:28:18,434 --> 01:28:20,959
I swear toyou, WWilliams...

824
01:28:21,037 --> 01:28:25,030
as soon as I get back, I'm gonna tell my
superiors about this fucked-up planet.

825
01:28:26,175 --> 01:28:28,905
They'll drop the charges
as soon as they get the report.

826
01:28:36,252 --> 01:28:38,277
That ought to hold it.

827
01:28:38,354 --> 01:28:40,481
WWhen you get there,
have somebody look at it.

828
01:28:41,557 --> 01:28:45,084
I couldn't get it perfect,
so it might leave a scar.

829
01:28:45,161 --> 01:28:46,492
I'm getting a collection.

830
01:28:46,562 --> 01:28:48,655
You'll be all right.

831
01:28:52,101 --> 01:28:54,035
- Comfortable?
- Yeah.

832
01:28:55,671 --> 01:28:57,605
I'll getyou a blanket.

833
01:29:08,751 --> 01:29:10,810
WWhat the hell areyou doing?

834
01:29:11,487 --> 01:29:13,421
Oh, this is where I get off.

835
01:29:13,489 --> 01:29:15,650
WWhat areyou talking about?

836
01:29:15,725 --> 01:29:19,661
WWe'll be in Chryse soon.
Can't letyou turn me in.

837
01:29:21,631 --> 01:29:23,565
I can't letyou walk.

838
01:29:28,204 --> 01:29:31,037
WWhatyou gonna do,
fucking shoot me?

839
01:29:39,348 --> 01:29:40,713
There's nowhere to run.

840
01:29:44,086 --> 01:29:46,213
Anywhere is better than hell.

841
01:29:49,225 --> 01:29:51,159
Catch you later.

842
01:29:54,563 --> 01:29:56,497
Yeah, right.

843
01:30:03,739 --> 01:30:05,172
Shit.

844
01:30:12,882 --> 01:30:15,180
And what happened to WWilliams?

845
01:30:15,251 --> 01:30:16,718
I don't know.

846
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:18,720
WWhen I woke up, he was gone.

847
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:20,085
And you were handcuffed?

848
01:30:21,257 --> 01:30:23,191
Must've done it
while I slept.

849
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:26,194
At that point,
I trusted him.

850
01:30:28,164 --> 01:30:30,223
That's all you have to tell us?

851
01:30:31,067 --> 01:30:33,001
That's all I know.

852
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:37,865
All right, Lieutenant Ballard,
I suggestyou get some rest.

853
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:39,874
You're dismissed.

854
01:30:52,722 --> 01:30:57,386
Is our statement to the Cartel going to
be that Mars is being overrun by ghosts?

855
01:31:22,685 --> 01:31:24,710
Attention, allpolicepersonnel...

856
01:31:24,787 --> 01:31:27,119
report toyournearest
