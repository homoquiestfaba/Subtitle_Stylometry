ZENDA LOCAL CELLULAR NETWORK TESTING WILL COMMENCE

3
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:16,993
IN 15 MINUTES.

4
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:21,096
HUNDRED BUCKS SAYS UNCLE MIKE DOES THE TONGUE-IN-LIP ROUTINE.

5
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:31,368
MY MONEY SAYS HE'LL DRUM HIS FINGERS.

6
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:55,884
MY MONEY SAYS HE'LL DRUM HIS FINGERS.

7
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:56,984
HEY.  HEY, DAD.

8
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,185

00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,987
YEAH, I'M GOING TO PRACTICE RIGHT NOW. COACH IS GONNA TELL

10
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,754
US IF WE MADE THE PLAYOFFS.

11
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,855
THAT'S UP IN THE BAY AREA, RIGHT?

12
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:07,090
YEAH. THAT COOL?

13
00:02:07,123 --> 00:02:10,592
YEAH, SURE IT IS, OLLIE.

14
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:14,594
YOU DIDN'T GET THE JOB, DID YOU?

15
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:17,596
NO. BUT I HAVE ANOTHER INTERVIEW LINED UP

16
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,564
FOR NEXT FRIDAY.

17
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,465
SOMETHING'S GONNA BREAK, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

18
00:02:20,498 --> 00:02:21,965
YOU JUST GO AND PLAY BALL, YOU GOT IT?

19
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:23,766
YEAH, GOT IT.

20
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:28,803
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO HAVE

21
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:32,172
REPRESENTED THOMAS GATEWICK SINCE HE FOUNDED THIS COMPANY

SHALL WE BEGIN WITH THE READING OF HIS WILL?

24
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:39,109
( tapping on keyboard )  ALL RIGHT, OLLIE.

25
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,951
WELL, COACH IS LATE.

26
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:54,452
MAYBE HE GOT THE WORD.

27
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:55,753
THINK WE'RE GOING TO BERKELEY?

28
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:57,587
I'M COUNTING ON IT, MAN.

29
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,488
IT'S GONNA BE NOTHING BUT BASEBALL.

30
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:00,989
YEAH!

31
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,191
HERE HE IS.

32
00:03:04,224 --> 00:03:07,993

PROFESSOR JONATHAN WOOLEY...

36
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:24,603
AND MY SON RUDY GATEWICK."

37
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:28,706
Man: CONGRATULATIONS, RUDY.

38
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,741
HMM?

39
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:32,408
( clears throat )  WELL, COACH?

40
00:03:36,211 --> 00:03:37,978
WE AIN'T GONNA GET IT.

41
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:40,813
THAT'S IT, WE'RE OUT.

42
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:45,516
I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU TODAY THAT, UH, THE VENTURA COUGARS...

43
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:48,718
JUST LOST TO THE TOPANGA BRAVES!

44
00:03:48,752 --> 00:03:53,887
( all cheer )  BAY AREA, HERE WE COME!

45
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,789
AND WE'RE GONNA BEAT THOSE BUMS!

46
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:59,090
( cheering )  WELL, RUDY, WITH YOU

47
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:06,062
AT MY SIDE, ZENDA'S HORIZONS ARE LIMITLESS.

48
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:08,196
THE STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE DELIGHTED.

49
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,998
ZENDA'S STAR PROGRAMMER CAN NOW GET THE RECOGNITION HE DESERVES.

50
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:13,966
I'M SURE YOU AND THE PROFESSOR WILL HAVE MORE

51
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:16,634
THEN ENOUGH VOTES AT THE STOCKHOLDERS MEETING.

52
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:18,669
HMM.

53
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:33,678
IT'LL BE A PLEASURE WORKING FOR YOU.

54
00:04:33,712 --> 00:04:37,714
OH. THANKS, UNCLE MICHAEL.

55
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:42,984
RUDY.

56
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:55,958
WELL, RUDY, IT MUST SEEM LIKE AN AWFUL BURDEN.

57
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:57,259
I KNOW YOU MISS YOUR FATHER.

58
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:59,160
WE ALL DO.

59
00:04:59,193 --> 00:05:02,829
I'M GLAD HE WANTED YOU TO HAVE THE BULK OF THE STOCK.

60
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:06,597
THAT MEANS IT'S IN SAFE HANDS.

61
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:11,101
PROFESSOR WOOLEY'S GOING TO NEED ALL YOUR HELP.

62
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:15,703
WELL, SIR, THE KID IS SMART.

63
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:16,970
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, BAXTER?

64
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:19,839
THAT I SHOULD BE HAPPY REPORTING TO A 14-YEAR-OLD?

65
00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:22,841
I CAN SEE IT NOW: "EXCUSE ME, SIR, I THINK YOU'VE DROPPED

66
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:24,508
YOUR POWER RANGERS WRISTWATCH."

67
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:28,011
"I'M SORRY. THE BOARD MEETING'S BEEN CANCELED. THE CEO IS

68
00:05:28,044 --> 00:05:29,778
STUCK IN DETENTION."

69
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:35,715
"NO, THAT ISN'T MY SON; THAT'S THE GUY WHO SIGNS MY CHECKS."

70
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:41,952
BAXTER, IT'S UP TO ME TO LEAD THIS COMPANY ON ITS TRUE COURSE.

71
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:48,156
MY NEPHEW, BRIGHT LAD THAT HE IS, IS OUT OF HIS LEAGUE.

72
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:53,092
BESIDES, I'M THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY NOW,

73
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:57,295
AND IT STANDS TO REASON THAT A GREAT COMPANY LIKE ZENDA

74
00:05:57,328 --> 00:06:00,964
SHOULD BE RUN BY SOMEONE WHO WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING IT

75
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:02,698
WHAT IT IS TODAY.

76
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:04,732
BUT WASN'T IT RUDY WHO DESIGNED THE ZENDA TURBO

77
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:07,701
OPERATING SYSTEM?

78
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:11,037
DESIGNS WITHOUT THE STRONG FOUNDATION OF LEADERSHIP

79
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,270
ARE WORTH NOTHING.

80
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:15,005
MY BROTHER WAS WEAK.

81
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,140
WITH HIM AT THE HELM IT WAS SHEER LUCK THAT WE BECAME

82
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:18,774
AS SUCCESSFUL AS WE ARE.

83
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:23,010
IF THIS COMPANY IS TO SURVIVE, ZENDA MUST BE TURNED INTO

84
00:06:23,044 --> 00:06:26,545
A STRAIGHT BOTTOM LINE OPERATION.

85
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:29,781
AND I'M THE ONE TO DO IT.

86
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,252
OH, ALICE, MOM LEFT THAT PERMISSION LETTER.

87
00:06:36,284 --> 00:06:37,185
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

88
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:40,654
SHE DIDN'T PRINT IT OUT YET.

89
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:43,089
WELL, SINCE YOU'RE THERE, HOW ABOUT YOU PRINT IT FOR ME?

90
00:06:43,122 --> 00:06:49,826
( laughs ) DON'T LET ME GET IN YOUR WAY.

91
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,261
OKAY...

92
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:54,696
( computer beeps )  ( CG dog barks )

93
00:06:58,165 --> 00:06:59,565
WHAT'S WRONG, OLIVER?

94
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,600
IT'S JUST WINDOWS 95.

95
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:14,641
YOU KNOW, I'M-- I'M GONNA DO IT LATER.

96
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:18,277
( sighs ) POOR BOY.

97
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:24,714
HAD IT TOUGH WHEN HIS MOTHER DIED, NOW HIS FATHER'S GONE TOO.

98
00:07:24,747 --> 00:07:27,182
I FEEL I REALLY SHOULD STAY LONGER. I AM, AFTER ALL,

99
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:28,883
HIS LEGAL GUARDIAN.

100
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,651
HE WAS JUST GIVEN HIS OWN COMPANY TODAY, SIR.

101
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,286
I THINK RUDY MAY FIND IT IMPORTANT TO RUN HIS OWN HOME.

102
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,320
BUT IT'S ONLY BEEN ABOUT FIVE WEEKS SINCE HIS FATHER DIED--

103
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:47,261
HE KNOWS YOU'LL BE LOOKING OUT FOR HIM, SIR.

104
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:49,662
YOU KNOW, WE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE DOWN IN DEVELOPMENT WHO

105
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:52,297
COULD BE HELPING YOU OUT WITH THAT.

106
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,198
THEY ALREADY WENT THROUGH IT.

107
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:57,634
I'M JUST GIVING IT A FINAL PASS BEFORE NEXT WEEK.

108
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:00,802
IT'S GOTTA BE PERFECT FOR THE STOCKHOLDERS MEETING.

109
00:08:00,836 --> 00:08:01,802
WELL, DON'T WORRY, RUDY.

110
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:04,371
AT THE UNVEILING I'M SURE YOU CAN MAKE IT SHINE.

111
00:08:04,404 --> 00:08:07,673
I HOPE SO.

112
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:10,875
WORK IS IMPORTANT, RUDY, BUT IF I WERE YOU I'D NEED

113
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:13,277
A BREATHER ABOUT NOW.

114
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:16,344
YEAH, I KNOW.

115
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:22,916
YOU'LL GET PAST THE PAIN, BUT ONLY IF YOU DON'T

116
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:25,117
CLOSE YOURSELF OFF.

117
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,818
YOU COULD STILL COME BACK TO MY PLACE IF YOU WANT, I--

118
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:31,353
I'D REALLY LIKE THE COMPANY.

119
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,990
THANKS, PROFESSOR WOOLEY.

120
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:38,958
BUT, UM...

121
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:40,693
I THINK I'LL STAY HERE.

122
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:45,029
FEEL CLOSER TO MY DAD.

123
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:47,797
I UNDERSTAND.

124
00:08:47,830 --> 00:09:02,105
WELL, THEN, WE'LL SEE YOU AT THE OFFICE AFTER SCHOOL.

125
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:03,806
( computer beeps )  THANK YOU, ARTHUR.

126
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:18,815
YOU'RE WELCOME, SIR.

127
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:28,788
(tires screech, horn honks)  Woman: HEY, WATCH IT!  HEY!

128
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:30,823
ZIP IT UP.

129
00:09:30,856 --> 00:09:32,223
WHO YA HONKIN' AT?!

130
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:35,192
Woman: YOU!

131
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:38,094
I HATE AGGRESSIVE DRIVERS.

132
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:40,128
LATER, DAD.

133
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,997
HEY, GUYS, HOW'S IT GOIN'.

134
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,732
HI. LOVE YOUR JACKET.

135
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:46,865
YEAH, IT'S NICE.

136
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:50,668
( horns honking )  Michael: HEY!

137
00:09:50,702 --> 00:09:52,002
LET ME HAVE IT!

138
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:53,869
UNBELIEVABLE.

139
00:09:53,903 --> 00:09:57,205
THAT COUSIN OF YOURS REALLY BURNS 'EM IN.

140
00:09:57,238 --> 00:09:59,306
YES, HE DOES, AND IT'S A GOOD THING YOU CAUGHT THIS...

141
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,374
BECAUSE SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN HURT.

142
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:04,743
WELL...DID THE NEW BIG DEAL CEO GET HIS HOMEWORK

143
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:06,044
DONE LAST NIGHT?

144
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:07,912
HEY, DOUGLAS.

145
00:10:11,747 --> 00:10:13,848
MORNING, RUDY.

146
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:17,084
OH. HI, FIONA.

147
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,218
HEY, YOU.

148
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,920
HOW YA DOIN', SWEET THING?

149
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,191
NOW THAT RUDY'S DAD'S GONE, HE OWNS THE WHOLE COMPANY.

150
00:10:29,224 --> 00:10:39,263
MAN, WITH THAT KIND OF CASH, YOU CAN HAVE MY OLD MAN.

151
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:48,737
MAN, WITH THAT KIND OF CASH, YOU CAN HAVE MY OLD MAN.

152
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:54,473
IT SEEMS OUR NEW CO-CEO's SCHOOL BUS IS STUCK IN TRAFFIC.

153
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:56,174
LET'S GIVE THE BOY A BREAK.

154
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,109
I SAY LET'S BEGIN THE MEETING.

155
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:01,810
WE'VE ALL GOT BUSY SCHEDULES.

156
00:11:01,844 --> 00:11:03,978
ALL RIGHT.

157
00:11:04,012 --> 00:11:08,248
THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING THIS SPECIAL MEETING.

158
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:12,384
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO RELATE TO YOU IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE.

159
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:15,419
IT MAY BE A LITTLE RADICAL, BUT IT'S THE BEST FOR

160
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:16,652
THE COMPANY.

161
00:11:16,686 --> 00:11:21,123
WHAT YOU ALL HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS A POINT-BY-POINT PROGRAM

162
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:23,790
FOR ZENDA'S REVITALIZATION.

163
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:25,759
REVITALIZATION?

164
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:27,993
EXACTLY. I'VE DONE THE PROJECTIONS, AND IT'S CLEAR

165
00:11:28,027 --> 00:11:30,495
TO ME WHAT MUST OCCUR IF WE ARE TO AVOID WHAT'S HAPPENED TO

166
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:32,129
SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS.

167
00:11:32,162 --> 00:11:34,096
IT'S ALL THERE IN FRONT OF YOU.

168
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:38,400
A PROJECTED SIXTY PERCENT INCREASE IN THE PROFITS IF WE,

169
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:41,334
A), CUT THE FAT FROM OUR OPERATING BUDGET, B) MOVE OUR

170
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,270
MANUFACTURING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HARD-WORKING LABOR POOL

171
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:50,840
IN MAINLAND CHINA, AND C) DOWNSIZE THE BLOATED

172
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:53,242
DOMESTIC EMPLOYEE BASE.

173
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:55,877
YOU'RE SAYING THAT OUR PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN

174
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,177
WITH US FOR YEARS, ARE JUST...

175
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,979
JUST SUPERFLUOUS EMPLOYEES?

176
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,447
WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF

177
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,481
THE STOCKHOLDERS.

178
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,482
AFTER ALL, IT'S THEIR MONEY THAT'S AT STAKE HERE.

179
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:08,484
AND WE'VE BEEN ENTRUSTED TO PROTECT THEIR MONEY.

180
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:10,986
ONE OF THE BEST INSURANCE POLICIES IS OUR WORK FORCE,

181
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:14,821
CURRENTLY MADE UP OF HARD-WORKING, LOYAL EMPLOYEES.

182
00:12:14,854 --> 00:12:17,356
AND YOU-- YOU WANT TO GET RID OF THEM?

183
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:20,224
PERHAPS YOUR HIGH-MINDED VIEWS AREN'T HELD BY OTHER

184
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:22,259
EXECUTIVES IN THIS COMPANY.

185
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:25,394
I SUGGEST WE PUT IT TO A VOTE.

186
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:28,396
LET HIM DO IT.

187
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:34,833
ALL RIGHT, MICHAEL, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

188
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:42,304
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF MICHAEL'S PROPOSAL, SAY AYE.

189
00:12:42,337 --> 00:12:44,772
Aye.

190
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,540
AYE.

191
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:47,140
ALL OPPOSED?

192
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:49,075
NAY.  NAY.  NAY.  NAY.

193
00:12:49,108 --> 00:12:50,309
THE NAYS SEEM TO HAVE IT.

194
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:53,478
THANK YOU, MICHAEL, AGAIN, FOR THIS VERY INTERESTING PROPOSAL.

195
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,379
ANYTHING ELSE?

196
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:57,346
NO. NOT AT THE PRESENT.

197
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,315
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

198
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:13,356
( card scanner beeps )  HI.

199
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,891
( chatter, rock music )  OOH!

200
00:13:21,228 --> 00:13:22,428
COLLEGE HUMOR.

201
00:13:22,462 --> 00:13:25,197
I CAN RELATE TO THAT.

202
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:28,265
HELLO, FELLAS.

203
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:30,200
( toy squeaks )  ( laughs )

204
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:31,533
OH. HI, UNCLE MICHAEL.

205
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:32,868
GOTTA GO.

206
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:34,402
SEE YOU, RUDY.

207
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:37,571
WELL, RUDY, WITH YOUR NEW POSITION I'D SAY YOU RATE

208
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:39,538
A CORNER OFFICE.

209
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:42,507
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE THAT?

210
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,508
NO, IT'S OKAY.

211
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,576
I LIKE IT HERE.

212
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:47,944
WELL, OF COURSE, I CAN SEE WHY YOU WOULD-- A RELAXING,

213
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,544
YOUTH-ORIENTED ENVIRONMENT...

214
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:54,481
HIGHLY STIMULATING TO THE FLOW OF CREATIVITY.

215
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:59,016
RUDY, THERE'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

216
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,551
OH. IF IT'S ABOUT THE MEETING YOU GUYS HAD UPSTAIRS,

217
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:05,020
PROFESSOR WOOLEY JUST CALLED ME ABOUT THAT.

218
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,354
HE DID?

219
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,223
YEAH, HE TOLD ME SOME OF YOUR IDEAS.

220
00:14:09,256 --> 00:14:10,424
AND?

221
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:15,093
UNCLE MICHAEL, I DON'T THINK MY DAD DID THINGS THAT WAY.

222
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:16,927
AND ZENDA'S DOING GREAT.

223
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:19,329
HIS APPROACH WORKED BEST FOR EVERYBODY, DIDN'T IT?

224
00:14:19,362 --> 00:14:22,397
WELL, OF COURSE, I AGREE WITH YOU, BUT...

225
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:26,299
IF YOUR FATHER HAD SEEN THE LATEST PROJECTIONS,

226
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:30,136
I'M SURE HE WOULD HAVE REALIZED THERE WAS A NEED FOR CHANGE.

227
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:33,371
WELL, THAT KIND OF THING IS MORE PROFESSOR WOOLEY'S TURF,

228
00:14:33,404 --> 00:14:37,073
SO I'LL JUST LEAVE IT UP TO HIM.

229
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:44,110
Michael: THEY WOULDN'T LISTEN TO REASON. SO IF THEY WON'T

230
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:47,312
LET ME WORK WITH 'EM, I'LL WORK AGAINST THEM.

231
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:49,247
WE'LL LET THE STOCKHOLDERS DECIDE WHO'S GOING TO

232
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,915
RUN THE COMPANY.

233
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:52,382
DO YOU REALLY THINK THEY'RE GONNA VOTE DOWN

234
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,316
WOOLEY AND RUDY?

235
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,518
ESPECIALLY WITH YOUR BROTHER WANTING THEM IN?

236
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:57,418
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT.

237
00:14:57,452 --> 00:15:12,361
I'VE GOT A LITTLE INDUCEMENT UP MY SLEEVE.

238
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:13,529
ONE, TWO, THREE...

239
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:16,329
All: TIGERS!

240
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:18,898
Announcer: WELCOME BACK TO THE KZPZ BERKELEY BROADCAST

241
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:21,100
OF THE ZENDA, INC. BASEBALL TOURNAMENT.

242
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:23,934
THE LOCKSLEY ACADEMY A's ARE LEADING THE RESEDA TIGERS

243
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:28,404
EIGHT TO SEVEN, WITH ONE OUT IN THE TOP OF THE NINTH.

244
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:30,338
HERE COMES THE PITCH.

245
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,474
AND A SWING AND A MISS, AS THAT ONE GOT RIGHT BY

246
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:36,608
ROSEMERKEL.

247
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:39,477
NOW THE OH-ONE PITCH, AND MATT CHESTER DELIVERS.

248
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,012
ROSEMERKEL HITS A FLY BALL TO SHALLOW LEFT FIELD WHICH

249
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:43,879
DROPS IN FOR A BASE HIT.

250
00:15:43,913 --> 00:15:47,182
GO, GO, GO, GO!

251
00:15:47,215 --> 00:15:49,917
STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE IS STAR SHORTSTOP OLIVER GILLIS,

252
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,485
WHO'S HAD A TREMENDOUS TOURNAMENT, BATTING .420

253
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,520
AND HITTING THREE HOME RUNS.

254
00:15:57,922 --> 00:15:59,956
THE INFIELDERS ARE PLAYING CLOSE AS THE FIRST PITCH

255
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:03,225
COMES THROUGH.

256
00:16:03,258 --> 00:16:04,959
STRIKE IT GETS THE OUTSIDE CORNER

257
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:07,961
FOR A STRIKE, AND GILLIS IS NOT HAPPY WITH THE CALL.

258
00:16:07,994 --> 00:16:11,663
AND FROM UP HERE, I THINK HE HAS A GOOD CASE.

259
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:13,464
STRIKE TWO!

260
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:18,134
COME ON, OLIVER, DON'T FAIL ME NOW.

261
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:26,072
HERE COMES THE OH-TWO PITCH TO OLIVER GILLIS.

262
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:29,640
AND GILLIS HITS A HIGH FLY BALL TO CENTER FIELD.

263
00:16:29,674 --> 00:16:32,976
AND IT DROPS, AND HE'S GONNA FIND HIMSELF ON SECOND

264
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:34,677
WITH A STAND-UP DOUBLE.

265
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,278
HIT THE CUT-OFF!

266
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:40,280
RESEDA NOW HAS THE GO-AHEAD RUN ON SECOND AS GORDON BREWER

267
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:41,681
COMES UP TO THE PLATE.

268
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:44,316
THE CROWD IS REALLY FIRED UP NOW AS THE RESEDA TIGERS HAVE

269
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:47,151
A GOOD CHANCE TO TAKE THIS WITH A HIT BY BREWER.

270
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:48,652
AND HE MAKES CONTACT.

271
00:16:48,686 --> 00:16:51,386
BREWER HEADS FOR FIRST, AND HEADED FOR THIRD

272
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,654
IS OLIVER GILLIS.

273
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:54,689
COME ON, LET'S GO! GO!

274
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,123
THE THROW IS IN TIME.

275
00:16:57,157 --> 00:16:59,558
BUT GILLIS AVOIDS THE TAG WITH A SPIN MOVE

276
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:01,060
AND HEADS FOR HOME!

277
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:01,993
TAKE IT HOME, OLLIE!

278
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:03,528
GO FOR IT! GO, GO, GO!

279
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:05,462
GET IT TO HOME!

280
00:17:05,495 --> 00:17:07,296
LET'S GO!

281
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:12,032
SAFE!

282
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:15,034
HE'S SAFE! AND THE TIGERS WIN, NINE-EIGHT.

THAT'S RIGHT, COACH, WE WON'T LET THE TEAM DOWN.

289
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,085

00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:08,138
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

316
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:10,740
WELL, I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND I SAW

317
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:16,576
YOUR LIGHTS WERE ON, SO-- CAN I COME IN?

318
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:17,644
UM...

319
00:20:17,677 --> 00:20:18,712
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

320
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:22,447
I WEAR PAJAMAS TOO, YA KNOW.

321
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,614
OKAY.

00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:25,582
THANKS.

323
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:36,555
AT SCHOOL WE NEVER REALLY GET TO TALK MUCH, BUT I WANTED TO TELL

324
00:20:36,588 --> 00:20:39,123
YOU THAT I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

325
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:41,225
THANKS.

326
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:46,661

I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE SAW ME IN THIS.

346
00:22:02,373 --> 00:22:54,204
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE SAW ME IN THIS.

347
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:55,505
LIGHTLY.

348
00:22:57,907 --> 00:23:01,308
THE SENSOR IS DISABLED.

349
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:05,178
( pane shatters )  I'M SORRY.

350
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:06,478
( computer beeps )  ( Arthur clears throat )

351
00:23:22,922 --> 00:23:26,857
CAN I GET YOU SOME HOT MILK TO HELP YOU SLEEP, RUDY?

352
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,858
MILK?

353
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:29,892
I DON'T DRINK MILK.

354
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:32,694
YOU HAD SOME THIS MORNING, SIR.

355
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:36,230
WELL, AS OF TONIGHT, NO MORE MILK.

356
00:23:36,263 --> 00:23:39,198
OKAY. WELL, I'LL BE TURNING IN THEN, SIR.

357
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:40,399
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

358
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:42,233
CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME.

359
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:44,234
GOOD NIGHT, ARTHUR.

360
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,411
CODE.  CODE.

361
00:24:01,444 --> 00:24:03,480
NINE.  NINE.  NINE.

362
00:24:03,513 --> 00:24:05,380
NINE.  NINE.  NINE.

363
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:06,948
FOUR.  FOUR.  FOUR.

364
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:08,583
FOUR.  FOUR.  FOUR.

365
00:24:08,616 --> 00:24:10,350
POUND.  POUND.  WHAT?!

366
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:11,550
POUND.

367
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:15,720
( beeping )  UH-HUH.

368
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:25,793
( door close upstairs )  SCATTER.

369
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:38,734
( door close upstairs )  SCATTER.

370
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:40,535
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

371
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:43,704
( loud splash )  COME ON.

372
00:24:48,507 --> 00:24:50,708
( groaning )  SHUT UP!

373
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:51,407
TURN ON THE LIGHT!

374
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:52,375
HUH?

375
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,343
SHH! SHH! YOU IDIOT!

376
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:08,619
( grunting )  YOU IDIOT.

377
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:20,526
( whimpering )  SHUT UP.

378
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,661
( sloshing )  SHH!

379
00:25:23,694 --> 00:25:25,862
SHH!

380
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,635
WAIT.

381
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,871
FRANKIE, GIVE HIM THE SACK.

382
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:43,306
TAKE THIS.

383
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:45,707
YOU GO THAT WAY.

384
00:26:10,956 --> 00:26:12,557
HEEEEEY.

385
00:26:13,758 --> 00:26:14,858
HI.

386
00:26:14,891 --> 00:26:16,559
WHO ARE YOU?

387
00:26:16,592 --> 00:26:19,694
UH, JUST THINK OF US AS YOUR GUARDIAN ANGELS.

388
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:21,962
YEAH, WE WANT TO BE YOUR FRIENDS!

389
00:26:21,995 --> 00:26:24,030
WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU ON A LITTLE TRIP.

390
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:25,965
ARTHUR!

391
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:31,801
( muffled shouting )  THE QUIETER YOU ARE, THE

392
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:35,504
BETTER THIS WILL GO FOR EVERYBODY. COME ON, TIE HIM.

393
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:38,639
BUDDY, WILL YOU LEAVE THOSE?!

394
00:26:38,673 --> 00:26:48,712
GRAB SOME OF THE KID'S CLOTHES AND LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

395
00:26:48,712 --> 00:26:56,349
GRAB SOME OF THE KID'S CLOTHES AND LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

396
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:57,617
( rings doorbell )  GOOD MORNING, SIR.

397
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:04,888
MORNING, ARTHUR.

398
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:06,956
IS RUDY STILL AT BREAKFAST?

399
00:27:06,989 --> 00:27:08,023
NOT YET, SIR.

400
00:27:08,057 --> 00:27:10,024
HE'S USUALLY THE EARLY RISER.

401
00:27:10,058 --> 00:27:12,626
WELL, WE BETTER GET HIM GOING, THEN.

402
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:15,061
YES SIR. MRS. COCHRAN WILL HAVE YOUR BREAKFAST READY

403
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:16,494
FOR YOU IN A MOMENT, SIR.

404
00:27:16,528 --> 00:27:18,730
THANK YOU, ARTHUR.

405
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,030
RUDY.

406
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:27,802
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

407
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,271
RUDY?

408
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,977
ARTHUR.

409
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,545
ARTHUR!

410
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,813
AND YOU DIDN'T NOTICE ANY DISTURBANCES AT ALL

411
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:46,713
LAST NIGHT?

412
00:27:46,746 --> 00:27:47,814
NO, NOTHING.

413
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:50,983
I LOOKED IN ON HIM JUST BEFORE HE WENT TO BED, SIR.

414
00:27:51,016 --> 00:27:52,683
THE GLASS.

415
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,588
SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG HERE.

416
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:03,323
I THINK WE SHOULD CALL THE POLICE.

417
00:28:03,357 --> 00:28:05,691
IS THERE A PROFESSOR WOOLEY HERE?

418
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,524
YES, ME.

419
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:08,693
SIGN HERE, PLEASE.

420
00:28:10,661 --> 00:28:11,894
THANK YOU.

421
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:14,930
WHAT IS IT?

422
00:28:14,963 --> 00:28:16,797
I DON'T KNOW, SIR.

423
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:28,472
IT'S RUDY...

424
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:29,972
HE'S BEEN KIDNAPPED.

425
00:28:30,006 --> 00:28:32,674
"WE HAVE THE KID, AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE RUDY GATEWICK

426
00:28:32,707 --> 00:28:36,342
ALIVE AGAIN YOU WILL DO NOTHING UNTIL YOU NEXT HEAR FROM US.

427
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:39,878
NO COPS, NO COMPANY SECURITY, NO ONE OR HE'S DEAD.

428
00:28:39,911 --> 00:28:43,547
YOU MUST FOLLOW OUR INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER OR ELSE."

429
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:45,048
OH, GOD, POOR BOY.

430
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:46,548
HASN'T HE GONE THROUGH ENOUGH?

431
00:28:46,582 --> 00:28:47,883
I'M GONNA CALL THE POLICE.

432
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,484
I DON'T CARE WHAT THE NOTE SAYS.

433
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:51,551
NO! NO, WAIT. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY CHOICE.

434
00:28:51,585 --> 00:28:53,620
I RECOMMEND WE OPERATE UNDER THE ASSUMPTION

435
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:54,954
THAT THEY MEAN BUSINESS.

436
00:28:54,987 --> 00:28:56,955
FOR RUDY'S SAKE AND THE COMPANY'S, WE GOTTA KEEP

437
00:28:56,988 --> 00:28:58,523
THIS UNDER WRAPS.

438
00:28:58,556 --> 00:28:59,790
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

439
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,557
GOD KNOWS WHAT MICHAEL WOULD DO IF HE FOUND OUT

440
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:02,558
ABOUT THIS.

441
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:06,694
LET'S JUST PRAY THAT WE GET HIM BACK SAFELY.

442
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:09,062
DID YOU HAVE TO USE TODAY'S PAPER?

443
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:11,797
MR. GATEWICK, IN JUST A MATTER OF DAYS

444
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,432
YOU'LL BE RUNNING ZENDA.

445
00:29:13,465 --> 00:29:15,967
WITH RUDY OUT OF THE PICTURE THE STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE LOOKING

446
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,668
FOR YOU TO LEAD THE WAY.

447
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:20,703
IF RUDY FINALLY DOES SHOW UP AFTER THE STOCKHOLDERS MEETING,

448
00:29:20,736 --> 00:29:21,836
IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

449
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:25,439
HE CAN'T BE CONFIRMED AS CO-CEO ACCORDING TO OUR BYLAWS

450
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,873
UNLESS HE'S PRESENT.

451
00:29:26,906 --> 00:29:29,741
THEY'LL HAVE ALREADY VOTED YOU IN.

452
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:32,977
THEY HAVE UNDERESTIMATED ME FOR YEARS...BUT THEY'RE

453
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,711
THE ONES WHO ARE WEAK.

454
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:37,546
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE LOOK ON WOOLEY'S FACE.

455
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:40,048
( chuckling ) BY THE WAY, WHERE IS YOUR

456
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:42,983
DEAR BROTHER-IN-LAW KEEPING OUR BOY WONDER?

457
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:45,718
THEY'VE GOT SOME SHACK IN THE WOODS.

458
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:46,985
NOBODY'LL FIND HIM THERE.

459
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:49,720
THE LITTLE RAT'S BEEN SHELTERED ALL HIS LIFE.

460
00:29:49,753 --> 00:30:00,794
LOOKS LIKE HE'S GONNA HAVE TO ROUGH IT FOR A WHILE.

461
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:03,162
Rudy: YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET AWAY WITH THIS.

462
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:04,729
NOW, WHO HIRED YOU?

463
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,997
SHUT YOUR TRAP, KID.

464
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,598
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

465
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:11,033
JUST THINK OF THIS AS A CAMPING TRIP.

466
00:30:11,067 --> 00:30:14,134
WE'RE JUST A BOY SCOUT TROOP OUT ON A SUNDAY HIKE.

467
00:30:14,168 --> 00:30:15,502
HEY, HEY!

468
00:30:15,536 --> 00:30:17,570
HEY, HEY, HEY!

469
00:30:17,603 --> 00:30:20,138
Announcer: IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING US NOW, THIS IS THE

470
00:30:20,172 --> 00:30:23,007
KZPZ BROADCAST OF THE ZENDA, INCORPORATED BASEBALL

471
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,074
TOURNAMENT.

472
00:30:24,107 --> 00:30:26,608
THE RESEDA TIGERS ARE LEADING VANCOUVER SIX TO FIVE

473
00:30:26,642 --> 00:30:28,711
WITH ONE OUT IN THE TOP OF THE NINTH.

474
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,578
OF COURSE, THE WINNER OF THIS GAME GOES ON TO

475
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:31,611
THE QUARTERFINALS.

476
00:30:31,645 --> 00:30:34,680
WAITING ON DECK IS STAR SHORTSTOP OLIVER GILLIS...

477
00:30:34,714 --> 00:30:35,881
IT'S JUST SO FRUSTRATING.

478
00:30:35,915 --> 00:30:39,650
IT'S FOOLISH BEING HERE WHEN THERE'S A REAL CRISIS GOING ON.

479
00:30:39,683 --> 00:30:41,684
WE STILL HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF ZENDA.

480
00:30:41,718 --> 00:30:43,786
RUDY WOULD WANT US TO.

481
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,387
( grunting )  ( coughing )

482
00:30:51,557 --> 00:30:52,558
HUH?

483
00:30:52,591 --> 00:30:54,125
THAT WAY. THAT WAY.

484
00:30:57,094 --> 00:30:58,894
OHH. OHH.

485
00:30:58,928 --> 00:31:01,830
CAN WE PLEASE STOP HERE?

486
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:06,632
YEAH, WELL, WE SHOULD BE KICKING BACK IN SOME QUAINT

487
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:09,034
LITTLE CABIN RIGHT NOW, BUT THANKS TO GENIUS HERE,

488
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,435
WHO KNOWS WHERE WE ARE?

489
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:14,471
HEY, LET'S TAKE FIVE.

490
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:15,839
RIGHT HERE, KID.

491
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:27,512
AND DON'T THINK OF GOIN' NO PLACE, OR ELSE.

492
00:31:27,545 --> 00:31:29,546
MY FEET ARE KILLIN' ME.

493
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,583
YOU BOZO, WHAT'D YOU WEAR THOSE THINGS FOR?

494
00:31:33,616 --> 00:31:36,218
YOU DIDN'T TELL US TO WEAR NO SPECIAL HIKING SHOES.

495
00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:37,551
FORGIVE ME...

496
00:31:37,585 --> 00:31:39,819
I FORGOT YOU WERE A MORON!

497
00:31:39,853 --> 00:31:42,020
( laughs )  ALL RIGHT.

498
00:31:50,226 --> 00:31:51,793
WHERE ARE WE HERE?

499
00:31:54,228 --> 00:31:56,230
( burps ) RIGHT HERE.

500
00:31:56,263 --> 00:31:57,196
WHERE?

501
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,997
MOVE YOUR FINGER.

502
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,999
RIGHT HERE.

503
00:32:01,032 --> 00:32:02,733
GIVE ME THAT!

504
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,935
YOU BETTER KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING, FRANKIE.

505
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:09,837
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE OUT.

506
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:25,514
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

507
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:28,815
LET'S GO! LET'S GO!

508
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:30,917
COME ON, JOEY, LET'S GET A PIECE OF IT, MAN.

509
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,951
WAITING ON DECK IS STAR SHORTSTOP OLIVER GILLIS

510
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:36,887
AS JOEY FARRELL TAKES HIS SWINGS.

511
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,188
FARRELL DRIVES ONE TO LEFT FIELD, BUT JASON GORSETT IS

512
00:32:39,221 --> 00:32:40,823
THERE TO MAKE THE CATCH.

513
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:43,224
THAT BRINGS OLIVER GILLIS UP TO THE PLATE, AND LET ME

514
00:32:43,258 --> 00:32:45,559
TELL YOU, THIS KID IS REALLY SOMETHING.

515
00:32:45,592 --> 00:32:47,693
HE'S BEEN PLAYING STELLAR BASEBALL THROUGHOUT THE

516
00:32:47,727 --> 00:32:50,061
TOURNAMENT, AND IS A VERY LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR

517
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:51,762
TOURNAMENT MVP.

518
00:32:51,796 --> 00:32:56,832
COME ON, OLLIE, OVER THE FENCE.

519
00:32:56,865 --> 00:32:59,901
AND HERE COMES THE FIRST PITCH.

520
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:01,501
A SWING AND A MISS.

521
00:33:01,535 --> 00:33:02,502
THAT OKAY, THAT OKAY.

522
00:33:02,536 --> 00:33:03,869
LET'S GO.

523
00:33:03,903 --> 00:33:06,038
ZENDA MUST APPEAR NORMAL.

524
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:08,106
MICHAEL WON'T SUSPECT ANYTHING IF WE'RE HERE AT

525
00:33:08,139 --> 00:33:10,240
THE BASEBALL GAME.

526
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,609
THE OH-ONE PITCH.

527
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:16,144
FOULED HIGH AND OUT OF PLAY.

528
00:33:16,178 --> 00:33:17,578
WOOLEY, WATCH OUT!

529
00:33:17,611 --> 00:33:18,878
WHAT?

530
00:33:18,912 --> 00:33:20,914
A FAN MAKES A GREAT CATCH.

531
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:26,850
LOOK AT THAT BOY.

532
00:33:26,883 --> 00:33:27,918
WHAT BOY?

533
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:29,051
THE BATTER.

534
00:33:29,084 --> 00:33:30,653
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

535
00:33:30,686 --> 00:33:32,987
IT'S HIT DEEP INTO LEFT.

536
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:34,288
OH, MY GOD.

537
00:33:34,321 --> 00:33:36,522
YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?

538
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,057
GILLIS IS TRYING TO STRETCH IT OUT BY HEADING FOR THIRD,

539
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,992
AND IS THROWN OUT EASILY.

540
00:33:41,026 --> 00:33:42,526
IT CAN'T BE.

541
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,794
LET'S FIND OUT.

542
00:33:44,828 --> 00:33:47,129
IF THE TIGERS ARE GONNA HOLD VANCOUVER, THEY HAVE TO DO IT

543
00:33:47,162 --> 00:33:48,797
IN THE NEXT INNING.

544
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,931
RUDY.

545
00:33:49,964 --> 00:33:52,766
WHAT?

546
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,733
RUDY, IT'S YOU!

547
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:55,768
WHO?

548
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:58,536
DON'T YOU KNOW US?

549
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,004
I'M SORRY, I THINK YOU GOT THE WRONG PERSON.

550
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:03,872
I GOTTA GET BACK TO THE FIELD.

551
00:34:03,905 --> 00:34:07,007
BUT--BUT-- BUT IT'S RUDY!

552
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:09,876
VANCOUVER IS NOW UP TAKING THEIR LAST LICKS

553
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:11,144
IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH.

554
00:34:11,177 --> 00:34:13,545
HERE COMES BILL GODDARD.

555
00:34:17,948 --> 00:34:21,083
LINE DRIVE TO SHORTSTOP OLIVER GILLIS.

556
00:34:21,116 --> 00:34:28,987
THIS BRINGS UP DAVID BAILEY, WHO'S THREE-FOR-THREE.

557
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:33,190
AND BAILEY DROPS A SINGLE INTO SHALLOW RIGHT FIELD.

558
00:34:33,224 --> 00:34:38,893
THIS BRINGS UP NUMBER 32, ROBIN McCONNELL.

559
00:34:38,926 --> 00:34:42,028
IT'S A SOFT GROUNDER TO SECOND, AND GILLIS MAKES THE TURN

560
00:34:42,062 --> 00:34:43,896
TO FIRST FOR A DOUBLE PLAY!

561
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:44,864
HE'S OUT!

562
00:34:44,897 --> 00:34:47,298
THE TIGERS HOLD ONTO A SIX-TO-FIVE LEAD

563
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:50,100
TO BEAT VANCOUVER, THANKS TO A COUPLE OF BRILLIANT

564
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:53,135
STOPS BY TIGERS SHORTSTOP OLIVER GILLIS.

565
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:55,904
THE TIGERS NOW MOVE ON TO THE QUARTERFINALS.

566
00:34:55,937 --> 00:34:59,072
SON, WE GOTTA TALK TO YOU.

567
00:35:01,607 --> 00:35:03,809
WHAT?

568
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:05,710
DO YOU KNOW ME?

569
00:35:08,044 --> 00:35:08,745
WAIT A MINUTE.

570
00:35:08,778 --> 00:35:10,846
ARE YOU GUYS SCOUTS?

571
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,047
NO, NO. MY NAME IS WOOLEY.

572
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:16,649
DO YOU MIND TELLING ME YOURS?

573
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:18,117
OLIVER GILLIS.

574
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,285
THIS IS TRULY REMARKABLE.

575
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,653
LIKE THEY'RE TWINS.

576
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:24,254
WAIT A MINUTE...

577
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:27,256
I'M GONNA GO, ALL RIGHT?

578
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:29,657
LET'S JUST STEP OVER HERE FOR A MOMENT, SHALL WE?

579
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:30,825
IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT.

580
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:40,631
IT'S OKAY, SON, WE'RE THE PEOPLE SPONSORING THESE GAMES.

581
00:35:40,664 --> 00:35:45,667
NOW...OLIVER, I RUN ZENDA, INCORPORATED--

582
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,834
THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE.

583
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:51,603
I RUN IT IN CONJUNCTION WITH SOMEONE VERY MUCH...LIKE YOU.

584
00:35:51,637 --> 00:35:55,673
IN FACT, ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE YOU.

585
00:35:55,706 --> 00:35:58,174
WHAT, A KID RUNS THE COMPANY?

586
00:35:58,208 --> 00:35:59,241
HE'S NOT JUST ANY KID.

587
00:35:59,275 --> 00:36:02,810
HE'S THE TRUE HEART OF OUR COMPANY RIGHT NOW, AND...

588
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:04,278
HE'S MISSING.

589
00:36:04,311 --> 00:36:05,913
HE'S MISSING?

590
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:08,147
HE'S BEEN KIDNAPPED.

591
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,648
REALLY.

592
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:10,682
UNFORTUNATELY, YES.

593
00:36:10,715 --> 00:36:12,616
BUT WE ARE GOING TO GET HIM BACK.

594
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,685
IN THE MEANTIME, IF SOME PEOPLE DISCOVER THAT HE'S GONE,

595
00:36:15,718 --> 00:36:18,654
OUR COMPANY'S GOING TO BE IN VERY BAD SHAPE.

596
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:20,955
WE COULD LOSE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY AND A LOT OF JOBS

597
00:36:20,988 --> 00:36:22,956
WOULD BE LOST...

598
00:36:22,989 --> 00:36:25,357
PEOPLE WITH FAMILIES TO SUPPORT.

599
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,925
SO, UM...

600
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:30,093
I GUESS WHAT I'M GETTING AT, OLIVER, IS...

601
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:32,228
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

602
00:36:32,261 --> 00:36:33,162
ME?

603
00:36:33,195 --> 00:36:37,298
WE NEED YOU TO PLAY RUDY FOR A FEW DAYS.

604
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:40,633
( laughs ) WHAT DO YOU MEAN, PLAY HIM?

605
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:43,368
JUST TO BUY US SOME TIME UNTIL WE FIND HIM.

606
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,069
HOW CAN I PLAY HIM?

607
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,770
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE KID.

608
00:36:46,803 --> 00:36:47,871
WE'LL SHOW YOU EVERYTHING.

609
00:36:47,904 --> 00:36:49,038
YOU MIGHT EVEN FIND IT'S FUN.

610
00:36:49,071 --> 00:36:52,273
YOU'LL GET TO LIVE IN HIS HOUSE, HE LIVES IN A BIG MANSION

611
00:36:52,307 --> 00:36:54,074
WITH A HUGE POOL, OLIVER.

612
00:36:54,107 --> 00:36:56,176
A SWIMMING POOL?

613
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:58,711
HAS A GIANT TV WITH THREE CABLE SPORTS CHANNELS,

614
00:36:58,744 --> 00:37:02,646
AND THERE'S PLENTY OF BASEBALL THERE.

615
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,280
I DON'T KNOW.

616
00:37:04,314 --> 00:37:06,715
WHEN IT'S ALL OVER, HOW'D YOU LIKE TO MEET

617
00:37:06,748 --> 00:37:08,383
THE SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS?

618
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:12,352
(scoffs) YOU COULD GET ME TO MEET THE GIANTS?

619
00:37:12,385 --> 00:37:14,119
WELL, THE MANAGER IS A PERSONAL FRIEND OF

620
00:37:14,153 --> 00:37:16,055
COLONEL ZAPF'S.

621
00:37:16,088 --> 00:37:17,188
WHOO!

622
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:21,224
WELL, WHAT ABOUT MY TEAM, AND THE CHAMPIONSHIP, YA KNOW?

623
00:37:21,258 --> 00:37:22,858
WELL, IT'S ONLY FOR A FEW DAYS.

624
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:26,660
WE'LL HAVE YOU BACK FOR THE BIG GAME WITH TIME TO SPARE.

625
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:29,829
I DON'T KNOW...

626
00:37:29,862 --> 00:37:33,965
NO. I--I DON'T WANT TO MISS ANY GAMES.

627
00:37:33,998 --> 00:37:37,267
I'VE COME A LONG WAY FOR THIS, AND MY TEAM, MY COACH,

628
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,702
THEY'RE DEPENDING ON ME.

629
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:42,870
WON'T YOU AT LEAST GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT?

630
00:37:42,904 --> 00:37:45,872
WELL, UM...OKAY.

631
00:37:45,906 --> 00:37:48,873
AND OLIVER, WHATEVER YOU DECIDE, PLEASE REMEMBER,

632
00:37:48,907 --> 00:37:53,210
THIS MUST REMAIN A SECRET BETWEEN US.

633
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:55,111
OKAY.

634
00:38:01,282 --> 00:38:02,849
( sighs )  SORRY, CHIEF, LOOKS LIKE

635
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:07,051
THIS WAS A WASH-OUT.

636
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:07,652
I DON'T KNOW.

637
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,286
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BOY.

638
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:19,359
HE JUST MIGHT END UP SURPRISING US.

639
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:39,871
HE JUST MIGHT END UP SURPRISING US.

640
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:42,006
( telephone rings )  HELLO.

641
00:38:46,942 --> 00:38:48,777
HEY, DAD. IT'S OLLIE.

00:38:50,378 --> 00:38:51,378
HOW'S IT GOING, KIDDO?

644
00:38:51,411 --> 00:38:54,213
WELL, WE WON AGAIN TODAY, WE'RE ONE STEP CLOSER.

645
00:38:54,246 --> 00:38:56,181
ATTABOY, OLLIE.

646
00:38:56,215 --> 00:39:01,484
HEY, DAD, WASN'T THAT INTERVIEW, WASN'T TODAY THE DAY?

647
00:39:01,517 --> 00:39:04,986
UH, YEAH. I JUST GOT BACK.

648
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,488
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S GONNA HAPPEN WITH THEM.

649
00:39:07,521 --> 00:39:10,323
INSTEAD OF BUILDING A NEW PLANT DOWN HERE, ALL MEDIA INDUSTRIES'

650
00:39:10,356 --> 00:39:11,923
GONNA DO IT UP IN CANADA.

651
00:39:11,957 --> 00:39:14,959
THAT'S A TOUGH BREAK.

652
00:39:14,992 --> 00:39:16,960
YEAH, OLLIE.

653
00:39:16,993 --> 00:39:20,996
IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THEIR JOBS,

654
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,196
YOU'D DO IT, RIGHT?

655
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,197
SURE I WOULD, SON.

656
00:39:24,231 --> 00:39:26,066
EVEN IF IT MEANT GIVING UP SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY

657
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:27,266
IMPORTANT?

658
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:29,067
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN SUPPORTING

659
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,769
YOUR FAMILY.

660
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:33,370
IS EVERYTHING OKAY THERE?

661
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,838
YEAH. YEAH, I WAS JUST...

662
00:39:35,872 --> 00:39:38,740

663
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:43,743
WELL, I BETTER LET YOU GO, DAD.

664
00:39:43,777 --> 00:39:44,810
HEY, DAD?

665
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:47,912

00:39:47,945 --> 00:39:50,714
SAY HI TO MOM FOR ME, OKAY?

667
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:08,258

668
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:09,925

00:40:31,005 --> 00:40:33,173
IS THERE A JOB IN IT FOR MY DAD?

677
00:40:33,206 --> 00:40:36,340
'CAUSE HE'S BEEN OUT OF WORK FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND HE'S--

678
00:40:36,374 --> 00:40:37,842
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

679
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,076
THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.

680
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:41,844
WE HAVE A LARGE OPERATION IN L.A., AND AT ZENDA

681
00:40:41,877 --> 00:40:45,146
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR ANOTHER GOOD MAN.

682

OKAY.

709
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:12,098
LET'S GET SOME SLEEP.

710
00:42:12,132 --> 00:42:14,333
EXCEPT FOR YOU, EAGLE SCOUT.

711
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,367
YOU GOT FIRST WATCH.

712
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,835
HA HA HA HA HA!

713
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,037
MAKE SURE OUR LITTLE BIRDY DOESN'T FLY AWAY.

714
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,205
YEAH. YEAH.

715
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,375
Tape: WHERE IS THE BATHROOM?

716
00:42:28,408 --> 00:42:32,210
( repeats in Japanese ) WHERE IS THE BATHROOM?

717
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:36,280
( repeats in Japanese ) NOW YOU SAY IT.

718
00:42:36,313 --> 00:42:38,515
Frankie: BENJO DOKO DESKA?

719
00:42:38,548 --> 00:42:41,049
WHERE IS THE BATHROOM?

720
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:43,351
BENJO DOKO DESKA?

721
00:42:43,384 --> 00:42:46,319
WHERE IS THE BATHROOM?

722
00:42:46,352 --> 00:42:48,187
AHEM!

723
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,955
DO YOU MIND?

724
00:42:53,423 --> 00:42:55,291
TAPE: NOW YOU SAY IT.

725
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:57,459
BENJO DOKO DESKA.

726
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,994
WHERE IS THE BATHROOM?

727
00:43:00,027 --> 00:43:02,495
BENJO DOKO DESKA?

728
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:04,997
WHERE IS THE BATHROOM?

729
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,199
BENJO DOKO DESKA?

730
00:43:30,078 --> 00:43:33,347
WHOA. HE LIVES HERE?

731
00:43:33,381 --> 00:43:36,183
THIS JOB MAY NOT BE THAT BAD AFTER ALL, HMM?

732
00:43:36,216 --> 00:43:37,983
HUH.

733
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:47,622
ARTHUR, THIS IS THE YOUNG MAN I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

734
00:43:47,656 --> 00:43:49,290
WHOA.

735
00:43:51,925 --> 00:43:53,092
MY GOODNESS.

736
00:43:53,126 --> 00:43:55,627
THE RESEMBLANCE IS AMAZING.

737
00:43:55,661 --> 00:43:59,095
STILL, WE'VE ALL GOT OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US.

738
00:43:59,129 --> 00:44:01,131
YES, SIR.

739
00:44:07,534 --> 00:44:09,235
HOW BIG IS THIS PLACE?

740
00:44:09,268 --> 00:44:10,937
IT'S BIG.

741
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,637
BUT FIRST THINGS FIRST.

742
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,505
THIS WAY, OLIVER.

743
00:44:19,308 --> 00:44:20,242
WHO'S THIS?

744
00:44:20,275 --> 00:44:22,977
THIS IS MR. HOUSEMAN.

745
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:24,377
PLEASE.

746
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,512
JUST A LITTLE TRIM.

747
00:44:26,545 --> 00:44:28,214
ALL RIGHT.

748
00:44:28,247 --> 00:44:30,648
WAIT! YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING MY HAIR.

749
00:44:30,682 --> 00:44:33,517
YOU CAN'T CARRY OFF THE RUSE LOOKING LIKE THAT, OLIVER.

750
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:36,351
FOR RUDY IT'S GOTTA BE SHORTER.

751
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,653
IS THIS GUY ANY GOOD?

752
00:44:39,687 --> 00:44:43,156
HE IS THE BEST THAT MONEY CAN BUY.

753
00:44:43,189 --> 00:44:45,390
OKAY, LET'S GET STARTED.

754
00:44:45,424 --> 00:44:48,593
NOW, IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO

755
00:44:48,626 --> 00:44:51,027
LEARN THIS STUFF LIKE YOU'VE LIVED IT.

756
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:53,995
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE YOU MUST BECOME EVEN MORE

757
00:44:54,028 --> 00:44:56,363
FAMILIAR WITH.

758
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,033
WHAT IS THIS?

759
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:04,568
THAT IS GOING TO BECOME YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND.

760
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:08,004
IT'S OUR COMPUTER WITH SOME OF THE ZENDA Z-2000 PROGRAMMING.

761
00:45:08,037 --> 00:45:10,038
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS.

762
00:45:10,072 --> 00:45:12,607
BUT ZENDA'S A COMPUTER COMPANY. PART OF BEING RUDY IS

763
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,407
KNOWING WHAT OUR COMPUTERS DO.

764
00:45:14,441 --> 00:45:16,709
HE'S OUR CHIEF PROGRAMMER.

765
00:45:16,742 --> 00:45:19,310
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 'EM.

766
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:23,413
WELL, ALL KIDS KNOW HOW TO USE COMPUTERS, DON'T THEY?

767
00:45:23,447 --> 00:45:24,680
I CAN'T DO THIS.

768
00:45:24,714 --> 00:45:25,715
OLIVER, WAIT.

769
00:45:25,748 --> 00:45:27,582
OLIVER, WAIT.

770
00:45:27,616 --> 00:45:30,951
I-- I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

771
00:45:30,985 --> 00:45:33,986
YOU'VE NEVER USED ONE OF THESE THINGS BEFORE, HAVE YOU?

772
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:35,220
NO.

773
00:45:35,254 --> 00:45:40,056
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO BE AFRAID OF SOMETHING.

774
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:41,624
I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID OF SPORTS.

775
00:45:41,657 --> 00:45:44,359
THAT'S WHY I ADMIRE SOMEONE LIKE YOU, A NATURAL.

776
00:45:44,392 --> 00:45:46,460
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, DON'T GET ALONG TOO WELL

777
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,395
WITH OUR FRIEND HERE.

778
00:45:48,428 --> 00:45:52,664
SO WHY DON'T I MAKE YOU A DEAL?

779
00:45:52,697 --> 00:45:55,366
I'M BETTING THAT IF IN THE NEXT THREE DAYS YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO

780
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:58,468
LOSE YOUR FEAR OF COMPUTERS, WE CALL IT QUITS.

781
00:45:58,501 --> 00:46:01,602
YOU GO BACK TO YOUR BALL TEAM, AND WE STILL GIVE YOUR FATHER

782
00:46:01,636 --> 00:46:03,404
A JOB.

783
00:46:03,437 --> 00:46:05,639
AGREED?

784
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,207
ALL RIGHT.

785
00:46:18,046 --> 00:46:21,981
"DEAR COACH, I'M SORRY, SOMETHING'S COME UP.

786
00:46:22,015 --> 00:46:25,984
I HAVE TO GO HOME FOR A FAMILY EMERGENCY.

787
00:46:26,018 --> 00:46:29,119
WILL BE BACK IN TIME FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

788
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:31,154
DON'T WORRY, I'M OKAY.

789
00:46:31,187 --> 00:46:33,222
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

790
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:35,456
OLIVER."

791
00:46:36,657 --> 00:46:41,359
( telephone ringing )  YEAH.

792
00:46:41,393 --> 00:46:43,161
HEY, COACH, IT'S OLIVER.

793
00:46:43,194 --> 00:46:45,296
OLIVER. WHERE ARE YOU?

794
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:49,264
I'M HOME. YOU GOT MY NOTE, RIGHT?  YEAH.

795
00:46:49,298 --> 00:46:51,499
YEAH, I WAS JUST CALLING TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I GOT

796
00:46:51,532 --> 00:46:52,466
HOME OKAY.

797
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,668
THIS IS A PRETTY BIG SHOCK.

798
00:46:53,701 --> 00:46:56,669
OLLIE. I MEAN, I HOPE WHATEVER THE PROBLEM IS, IT WORKS OUT.

799
00:46:56,702 --> 00:46:59,370
YEAH, WELL, IT WAS GOOD THAT I GOT HOME.

800
00:46:59,404 --> 00:47:02,005
IT'S KIND OF A FAMILY PROBLEM.

801
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:03,740
IS YOUR DAD THERE?

802
00:47:03,774 --> 00:47:06,108
YEAH, HE'S RIGHT HERE.

803
00:47:06,142 --> 00:47:10,444
I'LL LET YOU TALK TO HIM.

804
00:47:10,477 --> 00:47:15,147
( clears throat ) (British accent) COACH WILSON,

805
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:19,182
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT--  Cut the accent.

806
00:47:19,215 --> 00:47:22,785
COACH WILSON, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OLIVER

807
00:47:22,818 --> 00:47:24,519
ARRIVED OKAY.

808
00:47:24,552 --> 00:47:27,054
WE'LL SEND HIM BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

809
00:47:27,087 --> 00:47:31,423
( pots clanking )  ALICE! WILL YOU HOLD IT DOWN?

810
00:47:31,456 --> 00:47:33,491
I'M ON THE PHONE!

811
00:47:33,525 --> 00:47:34,792
LISTEN, COACH, I GOTTA GO.

812
00:47:34,825 --> 00:47:39,127
HERE'S OLIVER.

813
00:47:39,161 --> 00:47:42,430
WELL, COACH, YOU GUYS WIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF GAMES WITHOUT

814
00:47:42,463 --> 00:47:47,800
ME, BUT I WILL BE BACK FOR THE BIG ONE. BYE.

815
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:49,801
THE HIERARCHY OF THE ZENDA CORPORATION OF COURSE

816
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:53,236
IS VERY IMPORTANT. AT THE TOP WE HAVE YOU.

817
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:57,072
NOTICE THE HAIR, THAT'S WHY, OF COURSE, WE NEED THE HAIRCUT.

818
00:47:57,105 --> 00:47:59,239
AFTER A HARD DAY AT SCHOOL YOU CAN COME HOME

819
00:47:59,273 --> 00:48:00,774
AND HAVE A DIP.

820
00:48:00,808 --> 00:48:02,642
IT'S A NICE POOL.

821
00:48:07,244 --> 00:48:09,713
MICHAEL, WHO IS YOUR UNCLE.

822
00:48:09,746 --> 00:48:12,715
( continues, indistinct )  HE HAS MORE OF A NATURAL

823
00:48:22,587 --> 00:48:24,588
BOUNCE THAN THAT.

824
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:29,291
TEACHERS...

825
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:33,094
VARIOUS CLASSMATES, LIKE DOUGLAS, WHO HAPPENS TO BE

826
00:48:33,127 --> 00:48:35,595
MICHAEL'S SON...

827
00:48:40,531 --> 00:48:42,232
LET'S GO.

828
00:48:53,872 --> 00:48:55,340
HMM.

829
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:03,712
WELL, OLIVER, YOU'VE GOT A JOB TO DO.

830
00:49:03,746 --> 00:49:05,646
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M RUDY.

831
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,647
THEY'RE GONNA SEE RIGHT THROUGH ME, WOOLEY.

832
00:49:07,681 --> 00:49:10,182
JUST REMEMBER, YOU'VE WORKED HARD, YOU'RE READY.

833
00:49:10,216 --> 00:49:13,451
WE KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

834
00:49:13,485 --> 00:49:16,253
AT LEAST YOU'RE CONFIDANT.

835
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,588
WAIT, YOU FORGOT YOUR LUNCH.

836
00:49:20,489 --> 00:49:22,623
WELL, HE TAKES THIS EVERY DAY.

837
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,467
HEY, HOW'S IT GOIN', RUDY?

838
00:49:48,172 --> 00:49:50,774
OKAY, SAM, WE CAN GO NOW.

839
00:49:56,177 --> 00:49:57,411
HEY, RUDY!

840
00:49:57,444 --> 00:49:59,645
WHAT'S KEEPING YOU?

841
00:50:04,348 --> 00:50:06,416
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU AT LUNCH.

842
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:08,651
I WANT TO GET A NEW EXPANDABLE DIGITAL DRIVE.

843
00:50:08,684 --> 00:50:11,253
I NEED YOU TO GO OVER THE SPECS.

844
00:50:11,286 --> 00:50:12,753
OKAY.

845
00:50:15,288 --> 00:50:17,790
( classroom chatter )  HI, RUDY.

846
00:50:22,526 --> 00:50:23,693
HI.

847
00:50:23,727 --> 00:50:26,328
YOU JUST VISITING?

848
00:50:28,663 --> 00:50:30,431
UM...

849
00:50:32,265 --> 00:50:37,768
IT WAS REALLY NICE TALKING THE OTHER NIGHT.

850
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:40,303
ARE YOU LOST?

851
00:50:40,336 --> 00:50:44,505
ALZHEIMER'S MUST BE KICKING IN, HEY, RUDY?

852
00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:45,673
DOUGLAS.

853
00:50:45,706 --> 00:50:50,309
OH, I'M SORRY. EXCUSE ME.

854
00:50:55,579 --> 00:50:57,580
HEY.

855
00:50:57,613 --> 00:51:01,882
YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK DIFFERENT, SOMEHOW.

856
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:04,250
I DO?

857
00:51:04,284 --> 00:51:08,287
YEAH. SOMETHING'S A LITTLE OUT OF PLACE.

858
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,388
REALLY.

859
00:51:10,421 --> 00:51:11,855
I'VE GOT IT.

860
00:51:11,888 --> 00:51:15,224
YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR SECURITY BLANKET WITH YOU.

861
00:51:15,257 --> 00:51:18,326
DON'T HAVE THE LAPTOP OUT AND RUNNIN', HUH?

862
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:19,426
HA.

863
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:23,830
BUT HEY, YOU STILL GOT THAT REALLY CLASSY LUNCHBOX.

864
00:51:23,862 --> 00:51:28,632
WHAT? STARTING TO FIND OLD RUDY MORE INTERESTING THAN ME?

865
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:31,267
TRY A TOASTER'S MORE INTERESTING THAN YOU.

866
00:51:31,301 --> 00:51:34,402
WHAT?!  (Fiona laughs)  ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,

867
00:51:34,435 --> 00:51:38,205
NOT TO WORRY, YOUR MUCH BELOVED HISTORY TEACHER HAS RETURNED.

868
00:51:38,238 --> 00:51:41,673
DOUGLAS, I BET YOU WERE HOPING I RAN OFF TO TIJUANA

869
00:51:41,706 --> 00:51:42,941
WITH MISS McDONALD.

870
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,475
YES, SIR, I DID.

871
00:51:44,508 --> 00:51:48,177
I HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD TIME.

872
00:51:49,377 --> 00:51:51,812
Boy: LOOKS LIKE WE MIGHT BE PLAYING THAT WIMPY L.A. TEAM.

873
00:51:51,846 --> 00:51:54,681
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD BE WIMPY LIKE THEM. THEY'VE ONLY

874
00:51:54,714 --> 00:51:56,548
WON THEIR LAST EIGHT GAMES.

875
00:51:56,582 --> 00:51:58,317
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

876
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,551
THE ZIP DRIVE HAS A SEVEN MEGABYTE PER SECOND FASTER

877
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:03,853
SUSTAINED DATA TRANSFER RATE.

878
00:52:03,886 --> 00:52:07,222
WELL, IF IT ISN'T THE DAILY MEETING OF POCKET PROTECTORS

879
00:52:07,255 --> 00:52:08,389
ANONYMOUS.

880
00:52:08,423 --> 00:52:13,559
AND LOOK, IT'S THEIR CHAIRMAN-- MY SMART-ASS COUSIN RUDY.

881
00:52:13,593 --> 00:52:15,961
LOOK AT ME.

882
00:52:15,994 --> 00:52:17,561
NOW LOOK AT YOU.

883
00:52:17,595 --> 00:52:19,362
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE RELATED.

884
00:52:19,395 --> 00:52:20,430
WHO'D HAVE GUESSED?

885
00:52:20,463 --> 00:52:22,464
HEY, I'M ASHAMED OF IT TOO.

886
00:52:22,498 --> 00:52:25,399
AT LEAST MY FAMILY HAS THE GENES WERE IT REALLY COUNTS.

887
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,334
SPORTS.

888
00:52:27,367 --> 00:52:29,301
YOU KNOW, I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THAT, 'CAUSE THEY'RE

889
00:52:29,335 --> 00:52:30,936
PROBABLY THE SAME GENES THAT GAVE YOU THE I.Q.

890
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:33,204
OF A BASEBALL, RIGHT?

891
00:52:33,238 --> 00:52:35,539
( Fiona laughs )  WHAT'D HE SAY?

892
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:36,906
I.Q. OF A BASEBALL.

893
00:52:36,939 --> 00:52:38,407
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO RUDY?

894
00:52:40,842 --> 00:52:42,977
YOU CAN JOKE ALL YOU WANT, RUDOLPH.

895
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:45,845
I'M GONNA WIN MY SCHOOL THE CHAMPIONSHIP, AND THAT'S

896
00:52:45,879 --> 00:52:48,747
AN EXPERIENCE YOU'LL NEVER HAVE.

897
00:52:54,817 --> 00:52:56,551
( bell rings )  Boy: OH, RUDY!

898
00:53:20,633 --> 00:53:21,499
Boy #2: OH, MAN!

899
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:23,201
GREAT CATCH, MAN!

900
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:28,738
RUDY.

901
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:30,305
THANKS.

902
00:53:30,338 --> 00:53:32,473
MY PLEASURE.

903
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:37,576
Man: THANKS, SON.

904
00:53:37,609 --> 00:53:39,443
NO PROBLEM. HERE YA GO.

905
00:53:39,477 --> 00:53:50,017
NO. I'LL COME DOWN AND GET IT.

906
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:51,784
HOW'S IT GOIN'.

907
00:54:01,557 --> 00:54:03,425
RUDY.

908
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:05,960
RUDY, RUDY, YOU NEED A NEW IMAGE, MAN.

909
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:09,695
YOU GOTTA LOOSEN UP A LITTLE BIT.

910
00:54:09,728 --> 00:54:14,264
OKAY. LET'S SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

911
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:17,266
I WONDER HOW OLIVER DID TODAY.

912
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,501
PROFESSOR?

913
00:54:18,534 --> 00:54:21,602
I'M SORRY. I JUST CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT RUDY MIGHT

914
00:54:21,635 --> 00:54:23,270
BE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

915
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:33,677
I BELIEVE THE BOY HAS A SPRING IN HIS STEP, WOOLEY.

916
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:38,513
WELL, OLIVER, HOW WAS YOUR FIRST DAY AS THE GREAT IMPOSTER?

917
00:54:38,546 --> 00:54:50,954
WELL, I GOTTA TELL YA, THIS RUDY GUY HAS POSSIBILITIES.

918
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:52,554
OH, LOOK.

919
00:54:52,588 --> 00:54:54,522
IT'S AN ARBUTUS MENZIESSI.

920
00:54:54,555 --> 00:54:55,856
WHAT?

921
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,458
IT'S A GIANT ARBUTUS.

922
00:54:58,491 --> 00:55:02,860
( thugs all scream )  IT'S JUST A BIG TREE.

923
00:55:02,894 --> 00:55:10,699
THE KID STILL THINKS HE'S ON A FREAKING NATURE HIKE, LEON.

924
00:55:10,732 --> 00:55:13,767
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS LOOK A LITTLE TIRED.

925
00:55:13,801 --> 00:55:16,336
WANT TO TAKE A REST?

926
00:55:16,368 --> 00:55:20,004
( all groan )  NICE OF THE KID TO GIVE US

927
00:55:20,037 --> 00:55:20,938
A BREATHER, HUH?

928
00:55:20,972 --> 00:55:21,805
YEAH.

929
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:23,807
SHUT UP, BONEHEAD!

930
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,407
HE AIN'T GIVIN' US NOTHIN'!

931
00:55:25,441 --> 00:55:28,576
I'M THE ONE IN CHARGE HERE, RIGHT?

932
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,944
RUDY, TAKE A BREAK.

933
00:55:30,978 --> 00:55:32,845
YES, SIR.

934
00:55:39,515 --> 00:55:40,717
FRANKIE.

935
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:41,850
YEAH?

936
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:43,985
WE'VE BEEN OUT HERE TWO DAYS.

937
00:55:44,018 --> 00:55:45,152
YEAH.

938
00:55:45,186 --> 00:55:48,921
AND I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE A CLUE WHERE THAT CABIN IS.

939
00:55:48,954 --> 00:55:50,689
AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

940
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:52,991
I JUST BET WE'VE BEEN WALKING AROUND IN CIRCLES.

941
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:54,758
GIVE ME THAT MAP.

942
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:55,726
OH, NO, NO.

943
00:55:55,759 --> 00:55:57,660
WE'RE NOT WALKING IN CIRCLES.

944
00:55:57,693 --> 00:56:00,595
YOU SEE HERE?

945
00:56:00,629 --> 00:56:02,396
THANKS.

946
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:05,765
SEE, RIGHT HERE, THIS IS WHERE WE ARE, RIGHT ON THE MAIN TRAIL.

947
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:10,668
AND RIGHT UP THERE, THAT'S WHERE THE MOUNTAINS ARE.

948
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,602
AND HERE? HERE'S THE MOUNTAINS.

949
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:14,370
OH, YEAH.

950
00:56:14,403 --> 00:56:15,704
YEAH, I KNEW THAT.

951
00:56:15,738 --> 00:56:17,105
I KNOW YOU DID, SIR.

952
00:56:17,138 --> 00:56:23,843
THAT MEANS THE CABIN IS PROBABLY FIFTEEN MILES THAT WAY.

953
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:26,477
OHH!

954
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:27,878
ALL RIGHT.

955
00:56:27,911 --> 00:56:29,779
LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

956
00:56:29,812 --> 00:56:30,947
OKAY.

957
00:56:36,783 --> 00:56:39,118
BUT IF HE DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING BY TOMORROW--

958
00:56:39,151 --> 00:56:40,452
HEY, DAD.

959
00:56:40,486 --> 00:56:42,987
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

960
00:56:43,021 --> 00:56:44,488
DOUGLAS, MY SON.

961
00:56:44,521 --> 00:56:46,389
HOW ARE THINGS?

962
00:56:46,422 --> 00:56:49,024
GOOD. CAN I USE THE LAND ROVER?

963
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:52,126
NICE TRY. SEE ME AGAIN IN A COUPLE OF YEARS.

964
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:55,762
I UNDERSTAND YOUR COUSIN RUDY IS OUT SICK.

965
00:56:55,795 --> 00:56:58,996
JUST YESTERDAY, HE SHOWED UP TODAY.

966
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:00,498

967
00:57:00,531 --> 00:57:01,898
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING...

968
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:04,466
FUNNY ABOUT HIM.

969
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,669
HE SHOWED UP...TODAY?

970
00:57:07,702 --> 00:57:10,871
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I AM SAYING.

971
00:57:10,904 --> 00:57:11,871
I WANTED TO KILL HIM, TOO.

972
00:57:11,904 --> 00:57:13,773
HE WAS REALLY WEIRD.

973
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:18,075
WE'RE BOTH TALKING ABOUT YOUR COUSIN RUDY, RIGHT?

974
00:57:18,108 --> 00:57:19,909
YEAH.

975
00:57:21,743 --> 00:57:23,078
YOU WANT MORE, FRANKIE?

976
00:57:23,111 --> 00:57:27,881
NO MORE, KID. I'M STUFFED.

977
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:30,549
( telephone ringing )   YEAH, HELLO.

978
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:38,821

00:57:38,854 --> 00:57:39,788
ROVER 1 HERE.

00:57:39,821 --> 00:57:41,822
WHO'S CALLING? IDENTIFY.

00:57:41,855 --> 00:57:44,023
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL WHO THIS IS.

982
00:57:44,057 --> 00:57:47,092
GOTCHA, BIG CHEESE.

983
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:49,727
WHERE'S THE KID?

984
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,594
HE'S RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF ME. WE GOT HIM COOKING

985
00:57:51,628 --> 00:57:52,896
SUPPER FOR US.

986
00:57:52,929 --> 00:57:56,731
( all laugh )  YOU GUYS BETTER BE

987
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:57,832
ON THE LEVEL.

988
00:57:57,865 --> 00:57:58,932
ON THE LEVEL?

989
00:57:58,965 --> 00:58:00,767
ON THE LEVEL?!

990
00:58:00,801 --> 00:58:02,168
WAIT A MINUTE.

991
00:58:02,201 --> 00:58:04,502
BRING THE KID.

992
00:58:04,536 --> 00:58:06,403
LET'S GO, KID.

993
00:58:06,437 --> 00:58:08,138
COME ON, COME ON.

994
00:58:09,906 --> 00:58:11,807
SAY YOUR NAME, KID.

995
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:16,643
WELL, I--  SAY IT! NOW!

996
00:58:16,676 --> 00:58:17,911
RUDY GATEWICK.

997
00:58:17,944 --> 00:58:20,079
HUH? HOW'S THAT?

998
00:58:20,112 --> 00:58:22,113
HAS HE SIGNED IT YET?

999
00:58:22,146 --> 00:58:23,514
UM...

1000
00:58:23,548 --> 00:58:25,782
WE WERE GONNA TAKE CARE OF THAT TOMORROW.

1001
00:58:25,816 --> 00:58:28,050
MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO.

1002
00:58:28,084 --> 00:58:30,418
( click, dial tone )  Michael: HOW CAN THAT BE?

1003
00:58:37,089 --> 00:58:46,661
BAXTER, I SWEAR TO GOD THE BRAT IS HERE!

1004
00:58:46,694 --> 00:58:48,995
Baxter: MR. GATEWICK, BUT YOU JUST TOLD ME LEON SAID

1005
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:50,597
HE HAD THE KID.

1006
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:56,767
HOW COULD THERE BE TWO-- HOLD ON A MINUTE.

1007
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,870
THE OTHER SIDE SEEMS TO HAVE FOUND A RINGER.

1008
00:59:00,903 --> 00:59:02,571
YOU MEAN A DOUBLE?

1009
00:59:02,604 --> 00:59:05,873
HAVE OUR GUYS CALL THE OLD MAN.

1010
00:59:05,906 --> 00:59:09,074
WHEN HE HEARS THE KID'S VOICE THAT'LL SHAKE HIM UP.

1011
00:59:09,108 --> 00:59:10,976
YES, SIR.

1012
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:13,811
YOU KNOW MY ADVICE. YOU'VE GOT TO BRING IN THE POLICE.

1013
00:59:13,845 --> 00:59:15,645
BUT WHY HAVEN'T WE HEARD FROM THEM BY NOW?

1014
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:16,879
WHAT DO THEY WANT?

1015
00:59:16,912 --> 00:59:19,080
WE CAN'T WAIT MUCH LONGER.

1016
00:59:19,114 --> 00:59:22,516
GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE PUTTING THAT POOR BOY THROUGH.

1017
00:59:22,549 --> 00:59:25,151
REMEMBER, ONCE WE TALK TO THE POLICE, WE'LL HAVE SHOWN

1018
00:59:25,184 --> 00:59:26,551
OUR CARDS TO MICHAEL.

1019
00:59:26,585 --> 00:59:27,686
MAYBE HE ALREADY KNOWS.

1020
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:29,987
WHEN RUDY'S FATHER WAS ALIVE, MICHAEL WAS ALWAYS KEPT IN

1021
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,088
CHECK, BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S UP TO NOW?

1022
00:59:32,122 --> 00:59:34,223
MICHAEL? EVEN HE WOULDN'T STOOP THAT LOW.

1023
00:59:34,256 --> 00:59:38,059
( telephone ringing )  ZAPF HERE.

1024
00:59:38,092 --> 00:59:39,926
I DON'T KNOW, GENTLEMEN, WHO KNOWS HOW LONG THIS CHARADE

1025
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,594
WITH THE GILLIS BOY WILL HOLD UP?

1026
00:59:41,627 --> 00:59:43,962
IT'S THEM.

1027
00:59:45,897 --> 00:59:46,964
THIS IS WOOLEY.

1028
00:59:46,997 --> 00:59:48,865
Leon: GOT A FRIEND OF YOURS HERE YOU MIGHT WANT TO

1029
00:59:48,898 --> 00:59:50,099
TALK TO.

1030
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:51,867
Rudy: PROFESSOR WOOLEY?

1031
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,034
RUDY?

1032
00:59:53,068 --> 00:59:56,203
THEY TOLD ME TO TELL YOU THAT I'M SAFE, AND YOU SHOULD

1033
00:59:56,237 --> 00:59:57,370
DO EVERYTHING THEY SAY.

1034
00:59:57,403 --> 01:00:00,906
LISTEN TO ME, WOOLEY, THERE'S THERE OF 'EM, AND WE'RE UP--

1035
01:00:00,939 --> 01:00:02,039
RUDY!

1036
01:00:02,073 --> 01:00:03,207
Leon: LISTEN UP.

1037
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:08,577
YOU WILL DELIVER $10 MILLION IN UNMARKED BILLS ON THE 27th.

1038
01:00:08,611 --> 01:00:10,812
WE'LL TELL YOU WHERE AND WHEN.

1039
01:00:10,845 --> 01:00:14,547
AND REMEMBER, DON'T MAKE US HURT THE KID.

1040
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:17,949
IF YOU HARM HIM, I'LL MAKE SURE YOU--

1041
01:00:17,983 --> 01:00:20,184
LOOKS LIKE OUR DECISION'S BEEN MADE FOR US.

1042
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:23,153
THE 27th. THAT'S--  THE DAY AFTER THE

1043
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:26,888
STOCKHOLDERS MEETING.

1044
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:32,124
OH, AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU.

1045
01:00:32,158 --> 01:00:34,159
I KNOW, YOU PROBABLY WANT THE DAILY REPORT, AND I'LL

1046
01:00:34,192 --> 01:00:36,994
GET TO THAT, BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN WHAT I JUST SAW.

1047
01:00:37,027 --> 01:00:39,996
THAT ACADEMY TEAM, THEY ARE GOOD, I MEAN, THEY ARE

1048
01:00:40,029 --> 01:00:43,565
REALLY GOOD, AND DOUGLAS, MAN, HE'S GOT A GOOD PITCHING ARM.

1049
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,566
BUT OUR TEAM...

1050
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,600
I THINK WE CAN TAKE 'EM.

1051
01:00:47,634 --> 01:00:49,067
THAT'S JUST SPLENDID, OLIVER.

1052
01:00:49,101 --> 01:00:51,270
YOU SEEM TO BE GETTING A HANDLE ON THINGS,

1053
01:00:51,303 --> 01:00:52,870
AS I KNEW YOU WOULD.

1054
01:00:52,904 --> 01:00:55,839
AND IT MIGHT MAKE WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE

1055
01:00:55,872 --> 01:00:58,207
EASIER TO TAKE.

1056
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,240
WHAT?

1057
01:00:59,274 --> 01:01:02,142
SOMETHING HAS COME UP, AND WE MAY NEED YOU FOR

1058
01:01:02,176 --> 01:01:03,876
LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT.

1059
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:04,844
HOW LONG?

1060
01:01:04,877 --> 01:01:07,579
AT LEAST THROUGH THE STOCKHOLDERS MEETING.

1061
01:01:07,612 --> 01:01:09,280
WELL, YOU TOLD ME RUDY WAS GONNA GIVE THE SPEECH

1062
01:01:09,313 --> 01:01:10,614
AT THAT MEETING.

1063
01:01:10,648 --> 01:01:15,617
OLIVER, RUDY IS GOING TO GIVE A SPEECH AT THAT MEETING.

1064
01:01:15,651 --> 01:01:18,019
WHOA, THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE DEAL, MAN, AND THERE IS

1065
01:01:18,052 --> 01:01:20,253
NO WAY--  WON'T YOU LET ME EXPLAIN?

1066
01:01:20,287 --> 01:01:22,154
WE JUST LEARNED THAT WE CAN'T GET RUDY BACK IN TIME.

1067
01:01:22,188 --> 01:01:22,822
IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.

1068
01:01:22,855 --> 01:01:23,988
THINGS WON'T BE THAT TOUGH.

1069
01:01:24,022 --> 01:01:26,957
WE'LL WALK YOU THROUGH IT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. IS IT THE

1070
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:29,625
COMPUTER PROBLEM? BECAUSE YOU'LL GET THE HANG OF IT EVENTUALLY.

1071
01:01:29,659 --> 01:01:31,993
I DON'T WANT TO GET THE HANG OF IT!

1072
01:01:32,027 --> 01:01:36,629
IT'S FUNNY, I NEVER PICTURED YOU AS A QUITTER.

1073
01:01:36,663 --> 01:01:39,631
I AIN'T A QUITTER.

1074
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:46,635
BESIDES, YOU FORGOT, THERE'S MORE THAN JUST ME AT STAKE HERE.

1075
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:49,704
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU FIRST JOINED THAT BALL TEAM?

1076
01:01:49,737 --> 01:01:53,140
YOU WEREN'T THEIR STAR HITTER RIGHT AWAY, WERE YOU?

1077
01:01:53,173 --> 01:01:57,909
NO. I COULD HARDLY HIT A BALL.

1078
01:01:57,943 --> 01:01:59,910
YES, I KNOW THE FEELING.

1079
01:01:59,944 --> 01:02:02,579
BUT YOU DIDN'T LET IT SCARE YOU AWAY, DID YOU?

1080
01:02:02,612 --> 01:02:06,081
AND NOW TODAY, YOU'RE THE BEST PLAYER ON THE TEAM.

1081
01:02:06,114 --> 01:02:14,252
WON'T YOU HAVE A LITTLE FAITH IN US, AND IN YOURSELF?

1082
01:02:14,285 --> 01:02:19,856
( sighs ) WELL, PROFESSOR...

1083
01:02:19,889 --> 01:02:23,058
I GUESS TOMORROW WE CAN ROLL THE COMPUTER OUT

1084
01:02:23,091 --> 01:02:25,960
AND BOOT IT DOWN.

1085
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:27,760
THERE'S THE SPIRIT.

1086
01:02:27,794 --> 01:02:30,095
"BOOT IT DOWN."

1087
01:02:30,128 --> 01:02:34,698
HEY, AT LEAST I'LL BE BACK IN TIME FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

1088
01:02:34,731 --> 01:02:37,066
I HOPE SO.

1089
01:02:40,702 --> 01:02:42,703
WE'RE JUST GONNA HIT A COUPLE, OKAY?

1090
01:02:42,736 --> 01:02:45,571
MIKE, KEEP THOSE ARMS UP.

1091
01:02:58,346 --> 01:02:59,379
IT WAS GREAT WINNING, GUYS.

1092
01:02:59,412 --> 01:03:01,680
IT WAS EVEN BETTER BEING ABLE TO MISS ENGLISH CLASS

1093
01:03:01,714 --> 01:03:03,082
TO DO IT.

1094
01:03:03,115 --> 01:03:07,317
OKAY, LET'S SHOW 'EM WHAT OLD RUDY CAN DO.

1095
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:14,088
OKAY, RUDY, JUST DO YOUR BEST.

1096
01:03:14,121 --> 01:03:15,990
COME ON IN, IT'S ONLY RUDY.

1097
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:21,326
DON'T GET TOO COCKY, LADIES, YOU BARELY SQUEAKED BY TODAY.

1098
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,294
BUT COACH, WE DID WIN.

1099
01:03:23,327 --> 01:03:25,629
JUST SHUT IT AND GET TO THE SHOWER.

1100
01:03:25,662 --> 01:03:27,029
EASY OUT HERE.

1101
01:03:29,664 --> 01:03:31,132
WHAT?!

1102
01:03:35,902 --> 01:03:39,069
RUDY, YOU ON SOME KIND OF NEW VITAMIN?

1103
01:03:39,103 --> 01:03:40,938
BETTER GET BACK.

1104
01:03:49,709 --> 01:03:51,610
WHO THE HECK IS THAT?

1105
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,748
GET A LOAD OF THIS.

1106
01:04:11,422 --> 01:04:13,324
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

1107
01:04:13,357 --> 01:04:14,357
VERY GOOD, RUDY.

1108
01:04:14,391 --> 01:04:17,259
RALPH, I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR MAN FOR A MINUTE.

1109
01:04:17,293 --> 01:04:18,761
THAT'S ENOUGH, SON.

1110
01:04:18,794 --> 01:04:21,695
STEP OVER HERE FOR A SECOND.

1111
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:25,932
YOU'RE RUDY GATEWICK, AREN'T YOU?

1112
01:04:25,965 --> 01:04:26,965
YEAH.

1113
01:04:26,998 --> 01:04:30,267
HOW COME WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU PLAY BALL BEFORE?

1114
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:31,401
I DON'T KNOW.

1115
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:34,336
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO PLAY FOR THE TEAM?

1116
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:35,904
FOR SAINT MATTHEWS?

1117
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:37,738
WE'RE A LITTLE LIGHT ON POWER HITTERS.

1118
01:04:37,772 --> 01:04:39,406
OH, NO, I CAN'T--  BE ON THE FIELD TOMORROW

1119
01:04:39,439 --> 01:04:40,974
AT THREE.

1120
01:04:41,007 --> 01:04:42,408
OH, LAST SEMIFINAL'S ON FRIDAY.

1121
01:04:42,441 --> 01:04:45,109
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

1122
01:04:51,314 --> 01:04:53,281
I JUST HOPE THE BOY CAN PULL IT OFF.

1123
01:04:53,315 --> 01:04:55,950
THE Z-2000 DOESN'T GO OVER, ZENDA'S GOING TO BE

1124
01:04:55,983 --> 01:04:57,350
IN VERY BIG TROUBLE.

1125
01:04:57,383 --> 01:05:00,218
DOES HE REALIZE THE SPEECH MIGHT NOT BE THE END OF IT?

1126
01:05:00,252 --> 01:05:02,153
I DIDN'T HAVE THE HEART TO TELL HIM.

1127
01:05:02,186 --> 01:05:07,756
AND THIS JUST MAKES IT EVEN WORSE.

1128
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:09,691
THANKS, ARTHUR.

1129
01:05:12,859 --> 01:05:15,962
WELL, I GUESS THE HONEYMOON'S OVER, HUH?

1130
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,929
NO. OLIVER, COME ON IN.

1131
01:05:18,963 --> 01:05:23,399
THE COLONEL AND I, WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU.

1132
01:05:23,433 --> 01:05:27,134
SO...HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

1133
01:05:27,168 --> 01:05:29,669
WELL, IT WAS INTERESTING.

1134
01:05:29,703 --> 01:05:31,338
ANYTHING HAPPEN?

1135
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:35,039
WELL, I'LL BE PLAYING FOR THE ST. MATTHEWS TEAM ON FRIDAY.

1136
01:05:35,073 --> 01:05:40,309
PLAYING? BUT IF ST. MATTHEWS WINS ON FRIDAY, THAT MEANS

1137
01:05:40,343 --> 01:05:43,778
THEY'RE GOING TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP, AND, UH,

1138
01:05:43,812 --> 01:05:46,046
I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT ALL.

1139
01:05:50,015 --> 01:05:50,983
HA!

1140
01:05:51,016 --> 01:05:52,917
WE WON!

1141
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:55,318
THAT'S GREAT!

1142
01:05:55,352 --> 01:05:56,819
WAIT-- ARE YOU SAYING IF ST. MATTHEWS'

1143
01:06:00,154 --> 01:06:02,456
TEAM WINS ON FRIDAY, THAT I'LL BE PLAYING AGAINST 'EM

1144
01:06:02,489 --> 01:06:03,923
WHEN I GET BACK TO MY OWN TEAM?

1145
01:06:03,956 --> 01:06:05,024
OH, BOY.

1146
01:06:05,057 --> 01:06:07,325
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN PLAY ON THE ST. MATTHEWS TEAM.

1147
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:08,926
LISTEN, YOU'VE GOT TO PLAY THEM NOW.

1148
01:06:08,959 --> 01:06:13,329
YOU'RE RUDY. JUST DON'T PLAY THEM LIKE OLIVER.

1149
01:06:13,363 --> 01:06:22,468
NO. YOU JUST GET RUDY BACK IN TIME.

1150
01:06:22,501 --> 01:06:24,135
I GOT IT!

1151
01:06:24,168 --> 01:06:26,903
WE SHOULDA TAKEN A LEFT AT THE LAST FORK.

1152
01:06:26,937 --> 01:06:29,205
WILL YOU KNOCK IT OFF WITH THIS THING?

1153
01:06:29,238 --> 01:06:32,007
FACE IT, FRANKIE, YOU GOT US LOST.

1154
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,274
HUH?

1155
01:06:33,308 --> 01:06:34,942
UNH-UNH-UNH-UNH-UNH.

1156
01:06:34,975 --> 01:06:38,144
NOW LOOK, WHAT I WOULD LIKE IS TO BE IN THE CABIN

1157
01:06:38,177 --> 01:06:40,078
BY THIS TIME TOMORROW.

1158
01:06:40,112 --> 01:06:41,879
OKAY?

1159
01:06:41,912 --> 01:06:43,114
TOMORROW?

1160
01:06:46,216 --> 01:06:50,084
YEAH. WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW?

1161
01:06:50,118 --> 01:06:52,486
TOMORROW'S THE STOCKHOLDERS MEETING.

1162
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:55,488
WELL, I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT TOO MUCH IF I WERE YOU,

1163
01:06:55,521 --> 01:06:56,821
KID.

1164
01:06:56,855 --> 01:06:57,922
RIGHT, BOYS?

1165
01:06:57,956 --> 01:07:00,958
( Buddy, Frankie laugh )  HE'S ALL YOURS, DOUGIE.

1166
01:07:12,398 --> 01:07:15,033
COME ON, RUDY, KEEP YOUR EYE ON IT.

1167
01:07:15,066 --> 01:07:17,134
GO, RUDY!

1168
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,904
( chatter )  WATCH IT, DOUGLAS!

1169
01:07:26,873 --> 01:07:28,841
DON'T WANT TO PUT ANY OF OUR PEOPLE IN THIS HOSPITAL,

1170
01:07:28,874 --> 01:07:30,008
YOU GOT IT?

1171
01:07:30,042 --> 01:07:32,043
SORRY, COACH.

1172
01:07:32,076 --> 01:07:38,913
DON'T WORRY, RUDY, THIS ONE'LL BE NICE AND EASY.

1173
01:07:38,946 --> 01:07:40,448
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

01:07:49,153 --> 01:07:50,387
THROW TO FIRST!

1175
01:07:50,421 --> 01:07:52,822

COME ON!

1178
01:07:56,457 --> 01:07:59,492
I DIDN'T KNOW RUDY COULD HIT LIKE THAT.

1179
01:07:59,526 --> 01:08:00,860
YEAH.

1180
01:08:00,894 --> 01:08:03,062
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT FOR THE DAY.

1181
01:08:03,095 --> 01:08:04,929
( chatter )  I'LL BE BACK IN A SEC.

1182
01:08:20,038 --> 01:08:21,006
WAIT FOR ME.

1183
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:22,139
OKAY.

1184
01:08:22,173 --> 01:08:23,274
OKAY?

1185
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:25,075
OKAY.

1186
01:08:30,845 --> 01:08:32,379
RUDY?

1187
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:35,281
OH, HI.

1188
01:08:35,314 --> 01:08:37,949
YOU REALLY SURPRISED ME LATELY.

1189
01:08:37,982 --> 01:08:40,317
REALLY?

1190
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:45,220
I'M GLAD YOU'RE FINALLY STANDING UP TO DOUGLAS.

1191
01:08:45,253 --> 01:08:49,422
WELL, FROM WHAT I CAN SEE, HE'S HAD IT COMING TO HIM,

1192
01:08:49,456 --> 01:08:51,257
YA KNOW.

1193
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:53,859
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1194
01:08:56,227 --> 01:09:00,296
I WISH I HAD GOTTEN TO KNOW YOU BETTER OVER THE YEARS.

1195
01:09:00,329 --> 01:09:03,364
HEY, WE CAN START NOW, HUH?

1196
01:09:10,469 --> 01:09:12,803
( thunder rumbles )  HEY, WHY CAN'T YOU COOK

1197
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,311

1198
01:09:25,344 --> 01:09:26,878
SHUT UP!

1199
01:09:28,912 --> 01:09:33,182
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

1200
01:09:33,216 --> 01:09:34,916
KID...

1201
01:09:36,584 --> 01:09:39,085
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU'RE GONNA SIGN...

1202
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:40,820
RIGHT NOW.

1203
01:09:40,854 --> 01:09:43,955
WHAT'S THAT?

1204
01:09:43,988 --> 01:09:45,389
NEVER MIND WHAT IT SAYS.

1205
01:09:45,423 --> 01:09:48,325
YOU JUST PUT YOUR JOHN BABCOCK ON THE DOTTED LINE, AND

1206
01:09:48,358 --> 01:09:51,327
EVERYTHING WILL BE HUNKY DORY.

1207
01:09:52,627 --> 01:09:55,996
I DON'T THINK SO.

1208
01:09:56,029 --> 01:09:58,598
OH. REALLY?

1209
01:09:58,631 --> 01:10:03,100
WELL, I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE MUCH CHOICE IN THE MATTER, KID.

1210
01:10:03,134 --> 01:10:05,602
MY FATHER TOLD ME NEVER TO SIGN ANYTHING UNTIL I'VE READ

1211
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:07,970
THE FINE PRINT.

1212

OH, BOYS.

1213
01:10:14,273 --> 01:10:16,941

1214
01:10:16,975 --> 01:10:19,309
I'M NOT GONNA SIGN IT.

1215
01:10:20,644 --> 01:10:21,944
ARGGGH!

01:10:21,978 --> 01:10:24,379

01:10:35,353 --> 01:10:37,187
WE'LL DO IT OUR WAY.

1223

NOW, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO CHECK IN AT TEN O'CLOCK, AND I'M

1224
01:10:45,993 --> 01:10:49,227
TELLING HIM, IF HE WANTS THIS SIGNED, HE'S GONNA

1225
01:10:49,261 --> 01:10:52,530

1226
01:10:57,032 --> 01:11:00,234
OKAY, KID, YOU'RE SAFE...

1227
01:11:00,268 --> 01:11:02,169
FOR NOW.

1228
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:05,538
Zapf: THIS IS THE POINT THAT THE PROFESSOR WILL INTRODUCE

1229
01:11:05,571 --> 01:11:07,572
RUDY--THAT'S YOU--TO THE STAGE.

1230
01:11:07,605 --> 01:11:09,540
AND YOU JUST WAIT FOR THE APPLAUSE TO DIE DOWN AND YOU

1231
01:11:09,573 --> 01:11:12,508
GO RIGHT INTO YOUR SPEECH.

1232
01:11:14,109 --> 01:11:20,446
OLIVER, DON'T FORGET ABOUT--  NO.

1233
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,115
OKAY. AHEM...

1234
01:11:24,148 --> 01:11:25,516
"HELLO.

1235
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:30,085

AND YOU'RE RUDY.

1244
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:50,398
AND I'M PROFESSOR WOOLEY.

1245
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,365
ISN'T IT GOOD THAT WE REMIND OURSELVES WHO WE ARE

1246
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:54,066
EVERY NOW AND THEN?

1247
01:11:54,099 --> 01:11:57,135
ANYWAY, RUDY WAS JUST STARTING TO GIVE HIS SPEECH.

1248
01:11:57,168 --> 01:11:59,136
UH, RUDY?

1249
01:11:59,169 --> 01:12:01,238

1254
01:12:10,476 --> 01:12:11,610
YEAH.

1255
01:12:11,643 --> 01:12:14,278
BECAUSE IF THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR YOU, I'D BE DELIGHTED TO

1256
01:12:14,312 --> 01:12:17,047
MAKE THE PRESENTATION FOR YOU.

1257
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,381
THANK YOU MICHAEL, BUT THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

1258
01:12:19,415 --> 01:12:21,549
THE BOY HAS HAD A LONG, HARD DAY.

1259
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:23,351
ARE YOU CERTAIN?

1260
01:12:23,384 --> 01:12:25,152
THIS IS CRUCIAL.

1261
01:12:25,185 --> 01:12:27,119
RUDY WILL DO JUST FINE.

1262
01:12:27,153 --> 01:12:30,188
WE'RE STICKING TO THE PLAN.

1263
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:35,558
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN. I'M SURE YOU KNOW IF THERE'S

1264
01:12:35,592 --> 01:12:40,428
A SLIP-UP, THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE DISASTROUS.

1265
01:12:40,461 --> 01:12:41,461
DON'T WORRY, MICHAEL.

1266
01:12:41,494 --> 01:12:43,697
WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES, AND THANK YOU

1267
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:46,397

1268
01:12:46,431 --> 01:12:48,366
YOU'RE RIGHT, I SHOULDN'T WORRY.

1269
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:52,134
RUDY BEING WHO HE IS, I'M CERTAIN WE HAVE

1270
01:12:52,168 --> 01:12:54,202
THE BEST MAN.

1271
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,575
DO YOU THINK HE'S ON TO US?

1272
01:13:08,078 --> 01:13:10,312
BAXTER, MY FRIEND, THEY THOUGHT THEY'D PUT ONE OVER

1273
01:13:10,346 --> 01:13:12,714
ON US, BUT THIS IS BETTER THAN WE'D HOPED FOR.

1274
01:13:12,747 --> 01:13:15,449
THEIR RUDY IS GOING TO FALL FLAT ON HIS FACE TOMORROW

1275
01:13:15,482 --> 01:13:19,317
AFTERNOON, AND I, LIKE A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR, WILL BE THERE

01:22:29,948 --> 01:22:33,916
YOU'RE GETTIN' THE KID BACK TOMORROW, RIGHT?

1414
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:36,518
THAT'S OUR DISTINCT HOPE.

1415
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:39,486
HOPE? LISTEN, MAN, I CAN'T BE THIS KID

1416
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,654
THE REST OF MY LIFE!

1417
01:22:40,688 --> 01:22:43,790
Wooley: AND NOW IT'S MY HONOR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A MAN

1418
01:22:43,823 --> 01:22:48,826
WHO'LL BE PRESENTING TO YOU THE NEW ZENDA Z-2000 COMPUTER,

1419
01:22:48,859 --> 01:22:54,796
NONE OTHER THAN THE SON OF OUR FOUNDER, MR. RUDY GATEWICK!

1420
01:22:54,829 --> 01:22:56,730
( applause )  IF YOU DON'T GET RUDY BACK

1421
01:23:00,333 --> 01:23:02,300
TOMORROW, I'LL MISS THE CHAMPIONSHIP!

1422
01:23:02,334 --> 01:23:04,768
NOT ENTIRELY. YOU'D STILL BE PLAYING FOR ST. MATTHEWS.

1423
01:23:04,802 --> 01:23:05,970
WHAT?!

1424
01:23:06,003 --> 01:23:07,070
OLIVER, YOU'RE ON.

1425
01:23:07,103 --> 01:23:08,037
COURAGE, SON.

1426
01:23:08,071 --> 01:23:10,706
WE'RE ON YOUR SIDE.

1427
01:23:11,906 --> 01:23:13,841
( low chatter )  ( clears throat )

1428
01:23:21,678 --> 01:23:22,879
OH, GEEZ.

1429
01:23:26,115 --> 01:23:27,849
HE'S FREEZING UP.

1430
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:36,420
I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU ALL TO TODAY'S EXCITING EVENT.

1431
01:23:36,454 --> 01:23:41,757
A LOT OF TERRIFIC WORK HAS GONE INTO ZENDA'S--ZENDA'S--

1432
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:48,061
B-BOLD--BOLD NEW LINE OF COMPUTERS.

ENHANCED VIRTUAL MEMORY. HA HA!

1437
01:24:04,971 --> 01:24:07,740
THIS IS EVEN BETTER THAN WE'D HOPED FOR.

1438
01:24:07,773 --> 01:24:10,608
OUR NEW MODEM'S FOR-- PROVIDES A, UM--

1439
01:24:10,642 --> 01:24:13,710
I THINK IT'S TIME TO PUT AN END TO THIS SAD DISPLAY

1440
01:24:13,744 --> 01:24:16,544
OF INEPTITUDE.

1441
01:24:19,747 --> 01:24:20,848
UM...

1442
01:24:20,881 --> 01:24:28,853
THANK YOU, RUDY, FOR THAT FINE PRESENTATION.

1443
01:24:28,886 --> 01:24:31,487
I'M MICHAEL GATEWICK.

1444
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:42,861
( door opens )  Rudy: UNCLE MICHAEL?

1445
01:24:42,894 --> 01:24:44,595
WHOA.

1446
01:24:49,765 --> 01:24:51,766
( whispering )  COUSIN.

1447
01:24:59,504 --> 01:25:02,072
WHAT TOOK YA, COUSIN?

1448
01:25:15,547 --> 01:25:16,781
THANKS, UNCLE MICHAEL.

1449
01:25:16,814 --> 01:25:19,049
I CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE.

1450
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:21,550
HOW ABOUT THAT?

1451
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:23,018
THE KID WAS WHO HE SAID HE WAS.

1452
01:25:23,052 --> 01:25:25,586
I FIGURED IF HE COULD FIX OUR COMPUTER, HE HAD TO BE

1453
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,654
SOME KIND OF COMPUTER GENIUS.

1454
01:25:27,688 --> 01:25:31,723
I'M SURE YOU ALL MUST BE WONDERING WHAT'S GOING ON.

1455
01:25:31,756 --> 01:25:35,759
I THINK EVEN PROFESSOR WOOLEY WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED BY THIS.

1456
01:25:35,793 --> 01:25:38,960
BUT I'LL ALL BE CLEARED UP IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.

1457
01:25:38,994 --> 01:25:43,164
IN THE MEANTIME, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF MY COUSIN,

1458
01:25:43,197 --> 01:25:48,033
I'LL CONTINUES THIS PRESENTATION.

1459
01:25:48,067 --> 01:25:51,402
HERE IT IS, THE ZENDA Z-2000.

1460
01:25:52,536 --> 01:25:53,603
OKAY.

1461
01:25:53,637 --> 01:25:58,106
AS MY COUSIN WAS SAYING, THE ZENDA Z-2000 WAS DESIGNED

1462
01:25:58,139 --> 01:26:02,508
TO OUTPERFORM, OUTDISTANCE, AND SIMPLY OUTDO EVERY PERSONAL

1463
01:26:02,542 --> 01:26:04,142
COMPUTER ON THE MARKET.

1464
01:26:04,176 --> 01:26:07,712
WITH OUR NEW OPTICAL ABLE 8 SPEED CD-ROM--

1465
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:09,813
SHOW 'EM.

1466
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,816
( beeps )  --ZENDA BRINGS REMOVABLE

1467
01:26:13,849 --> 01:26:16,917
STORAGE INTO THE 21st CENTURY.

1468
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:21,586
THE 892 KILOBYTE CABLE TV MODEM PROVIDES A REAL-TIME LINK TO

1469
01:26:21,619 --> 01:26:23,121
THE INTERNET.

1470
01:26:23,154 --> 01:26:25,656
NOW, THESE ARE SOME OF THE FEATURES THAT PLACE THE Z-2000

1471
01:26:25,689 --> 01:26:27,990
YEARS AHEAD OF COMPETING MODELS.

1472
01:26:28,024 --> 01:26:32,426
AND AS YOU CAN SEE, IT IS ZENDA'S REFUSAL TO CUT CORNERS

1473
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:34,994
THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO REMAIN NUMBER ONE.

1474
01:26:35,028 --> 01:26:38,163
THAT IS WHY IT IS CRUCIAL THAT YOU CAST YOUR VOTES

1475
01:26:38,197 --> 01:26:44,934
FOR THE MANAGERIAL TEAM LED BY PROFESSOR JONATHAN WOOLEY.

1476
01:26:44,967 --> 01:26:50,537
IF MY FATHER WAS WITH US TODAY...

1477
01:26:50,571 --> 01:26:53,740
HE'D ASK YOU TO DO THE SAME.

1478
01:26:57,808 --> 01:26:59,709
( applause )  THANK YOU, RUDY, AND, UH,

1479
01:27:03,045 --> 01:27:04,445
RUDY'S COUSIN.

1480
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:07,881
NOW THAT WE'VE ALL SEEN ZENDA'S NEW Z-2000...

1481
01:27:07,914 --> 01:27:10,683
IN SPITE OF WHAT YOU THINK, IT'S NOT OVER YET.

1482
01:27:10,716 --> 01:27:12,183
OH, YES, IT IS.

1483
01:27:18,888 --> 01:27:20,555
RECOGNIZE THIS?

1484
01:27:20,589 --> 01:27:21,722
DON'T BOTHER READING IT.

1485
01:27:21,756 --> 01:27:24,591
YOU KNOW WHAT IT SAYS, UNCLE MICHAEL.

1486
01:27:24,624 --> 01:27:27,226
EXCEPT THE NAMES ARE REVERSED NOW.

1487
01:27:27,259 --> 01:27:30,795
PLEASE! YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO FRAME ME WITH THIS

1488
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:33,630
OBVIOUS FORGERY.

1489
01:27:44,035 --> 01:27:47,671
Leon (on tape): MR. GATEWICK, IF YOU WANT HIM TO SIGN THE

1490
01:27:47,705 --> 01:27:52,107
COMPANY OVER TO YOU, WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LET US,

1491
01:27:52,141 --> 01:27:55,943
YOU KNOW, SMACK HIM AROUND A LITTLE BIT.

1492
01:27:55,977 --> 01:27:57,544
SOUNDS LIKE A 403.

1493
01:27:57,577 --> 01:27:59,011
POINT 5.

1494
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:03,515
( Japanese learning tape )  WELL, WAY TO GO, RUDY.

1495
01:28:43,172 --> 01:28:45,006
BY THE WAY, I'M OLLIE.

1496
01:28:45,039 --> 01:28:46,174
HI, OLIVER.

1497
01:28:46,207 --> 01:28:48,809
THANKS FOR BUYING US SOME TIME.

1498
01:28:48,842 --> 01:28:51,476
( applause )  WHAT?!

1499
01:29:02,683 --> 01:29:06,252
THIS IS THE KZPZ BERKELEY BROADCAST OF THE ZENDA, INC.

1500
01:29:06,286 --> 01:29:07,386
CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.

1501
01:29:07,419 --> 01:29:10,288
HERE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH THE ST. MATTHEWS GIANTS

1502
01:29:10,321 --> 01:29:13,290
MAINTAIN A SLIM ONE-RUN LEAD OVER THE RESEDA TIGERS.

1503
01:29:13,323 --> 01:29:16,292
THE GIANTS STAR PITCHER DOUGLAS GATEWICK HAS JUST STRUCK OUT

1504
01:29:16,325 --> 01:29:19,259
HIS SEVENTH OF THE GAME, WHICH BRINGS UP TIGERS FIRST BASEMAN

1505
01:29:19,293 --> 01:29:21,894
CHARLIE ROSEMERKEL.

1506
01:29:21,928 --> 01:29:24,696
ROSEMERKEL'S HAD TROUBLE TODAY AGAINST THE GATEWICK FASTBALL.

1507
01:29:24,729 --> 01:29:27,631
THIS CAPACITY CROWD IS LOVING THE GAME, AND IT COULDN'T HAVE

1508
01:29:27,665 --> 01:29:29,132
COME TO A MORE DRAMATIC FINISH.

1509
01:29:29,165 --> 01:29:30,333
COME ON, CHARLIE!

1510
01:29:30,366 --> 01:29:34,135
SHORTSTOP OLIVER GILLIS WAITS ON DECK AS GATEWICK...

1511
01:29:34,168 --> 01:29:36,603
HE PRETENDED TO BE THE KID WHEN THE REAL KID WAS OFF

1512
01:29:36,636 --> 01:29:37,637
IN THE WOODS SOMEWHERE.

1513
01:29:37,671 --> 01:29:38,638
HE WAS CAMPING?

1514
01:29:38,672 --> 01:29:40,172
NO, NO, HE WAS A HOSTAGE.

1515
01:29:40,206 --> 01:29:43,208
HOSTAGE?! YOU NEVER TOLD ME HOSTAGE!

1516
01:29:43,241 --> 01:29:47,210
AND NOW THE OH-ONE OFFERING TO CHARLIE ROSEMERKEL.

1517
01:29:47,243 --> 01:29:48,444
A PITCH RIGHT DOWN THE PIPE...

1518
01:29:48,477 --> 01:29:51,645
HONEY, PLEASE, OLLIE'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT LATER, OKAY?

1519
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:52,780
COME ON, KID!

1520
01:29:52,813 --> 01:29:54,214
LET'S GO, CHARLIE!

1521
01:30:00,084 --> 01:30:03,320
IT'S A SOLID DRIVE INTO RIGHT FIELD WHICH LOOKS LIKE, YES,

1522
01:30:03,353 --> 01:30:04,887
IT FALLS IN A FOR A BASE HIT.

1523
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,989
THIS NOW BRINGS UP OLIVER GILLIS IN A MUCH-ANTICIPATED

1524
01:30:08,022 --> 01:30:10,891
RIVALRY WITH TWO OUTS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH.

1525
01:30:10,924 --> 01:30:12,058
YOU CAN DO THIS.

1526
01:30:12,091 --> 01:30:13,659
NOW GET UP THERE.

1527
01:30:13,693 --> 01:30:16,194
I WON'T LET THE TEAM DOWN.

1528
01:30:22,865 --> 01:30:25,333
THE CROWD LOVES THIS KID.

1529
01:30:25,366 --> 01:30:26,933
Both: GO, OLLIE!

1530
01:30:26,967 --> 01:30:29,835
OLIVER GILLIS IS TWO FOR TWO TODAY, WITH A HOME RUN

1531
01:30:29,869 --> 01:30:31,337
AND A DOUBLE.

1532
01:30:31,370 --> 01:30:34,271
I KNOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE CHEERING FOR ST. MATTHEWS,

1533
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:38,207
BUT KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK, OLIVER!

1534
01:30:38,241 --> 01:30:39,841
TIME!

1535
01:30:39,875 --> 01:30:41,876
TIME!

1536
01:30:41,909 --> 01:30:43,911
TIME OUT IS CALLED AS COACH PALMER OF THE

1537
01:30:43,943 --> 01:30:45,078
ST. MATTHEWS GIANTS...

1538
01:30:45,111 --> 01:30:47,279
DOUGLAS, I WANT YOU TO WALK THIS GUY.

1539
01:30:47,312 --> 01:30:49,614
WALK HIM. ARE YOU CRAZY?

1540
01:30:49,647 --> 01:30:51,082
WE CAN'T TAKE THE CHANCE.

1541
01:30:51,115 --> 01:30:52,349
I CAN GET THIS GUY OUT.

1542
01:30:52,382 --> 01:30:53,617
I KNOW IT!

1543
01:30:53,650 --> 01:30:56,218
JUST WALK HIM.

1544
01:30:56,252 --> 01:30:59,620
DOUGLAS GATEWICK HAS PITCHED SPLENDIDLY TODAY, STRIKING OUT

1545
01:30:59,653 --> 01:31:00,988
SEVEN.

1546
01:31:02,922 --> 01:31:05,223
ROSEMERKEL STILL TAKES A SLIGHT LEAD OFF FIRST AS GATEWICK

1547
01:31:05,257 --> 01:31:07,291
LOOKS IN FOR THE SIGN.

1548
01:31:08,792 --> 01:31:11,660
THE PITCH IS HIGH AND INSIDE AS GILLIS IS FORCED TO DUCK OUT

1549
01:31:11,693 --> 01:31:13,061
OF THE BATTER'S BOX.

1550
01:31:13,095 --> 01:31:18,164
THE CROWD IS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT THROW.

1551
01:31:18,198 --> 01:31:21,200
SO THE COUNT IS NOW ONE AND OH AS GILLIS PREPARES TO SEE

1552
01:31:21,233 --> 01:31:23,601
THE OH-ONE DELIVERY.

1553
01:31:27,003 --> 01:31:29,104
ROSEMERKEL STILL LEADING OFF FIRST.

1554
01:31:29,137 --> 01:31:30,639
COME ON, OLLIE!

1555
01:31:30,672 --> 01:31:32,006
ALL RIGHT!

1556
01:31:33,007 --> 01:31:35,174
( grunts )  AND IT'S A STRIKE ON

1557
01:31:35,208 --> 01:31:36,808
THE OUTSIDE CORNER.

1558
01:31:36,842 --> 01:31:48,616
IT LOOKED LIKE GILLIS WAS REALLY CHASING THAT ONE.

1559
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:50,851
DOUGLAS SAYS YOU'RE WHITE TRASH,

1560
01:31:50,884 --> 01:31:55,120
AND HE'S GONNA SHUT YOU DOWN.

1561
01:31:55,153 --> 01:31:57,688
DON'T BET ON IT.

1562
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:09,261
GATEWICK STEPS BACK UP TO THE MOUND FOR THE ONE-ONE DELIVERY.

1563
01:32:09,295 --> 01:32:11,130
DOUGLAS, DON'T YOU DARE.

1564
01:32:15,899 --> 01:32:21,735
ROSEMERKEL STILL LEADING OFF FIRST...

1565
01:32:21,769 --> 01:32:23,103
COME ON, OLLIE!

1566
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:28,173
GATEWICK STEPS BACK UP TO THE MOUND...

1567
01:32:28,206 --> 01:32:29,273
GILLIS HITS IT!

1568
01:32:29,307 --> 01:32:31,875
IT'S A LONG FLY BALL TO DEEP LEFT FIELD

1569
01:32:31,908 --> 01:32:34,109
WHICH GOES OVER THE HEADS OF A COUPLE OF OUTFIELDERS

1570
01:32:34,143 --> 01:32:37,045
AND FALLS IN, AND THIS COULD BE EXTRA BASES!

1571
01:32:37,078 --> 01:32:38,179
COME ON HOME!

1572
01:32:38,212 --> 01:32:40,147
ROSEMERKEL EASILY COMES AROUND TO SCORE, AND NOW

1573
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:43,716
IT'S TIED UP AS GILLIS REPRESENTS THE GO-AHEAD RUN.

1574
01:32:43,749 --> 01:32:48,118
ROUNDING SECOND IS GILLIS AS THE THROW IS GONNA BE CLOSE!

1575
01:32:48,152 --> 01:32:49,886
HERE COMES THE THROW...

1576
01:32:49,919 --> 01:32:53,955
AND IT'S NOT IN TIME, BUT THEY'VE GOT GILLIS TRAPPED.

1577
01:32:53,988 --> 01:32:55,089
GIVE IT TO ME!

1578
01:32:55,122 --> 01:32:56,723
GO HOME, BABY, GO HOME!

1579
01:32:56,756 --> 01:33:00,059
AND HE THROWS TO GET GILLIS...

1580
01:33:00,092 --> 01:33:01,993
SLIDE!

1581
01:33:02,026 --> 01:33:03,628
