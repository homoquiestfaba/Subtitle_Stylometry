1
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:00,466
watch your speed, Diaz.
we don't need the cops pulling you over.

2
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:02,866
-How far's the turnoff?
-Couple of miles.

3
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,872
Puts you right on the interstate
out of Gotham.

4
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:08,777
what was that?

5
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,276
It's Batman, ain't it?

6
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:30,227
Jeez Louise, it's a woman!

7
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:41,241
what are you sitting there for?

8
00:02:14,543 --> 00:02:15,567
Get out!

9
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:59,684
whoa, who's having the light show?

10
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,970
Haven't seen her around the cave.

11
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:50,279
Could she have been an old opponent
in a new disguise? Perhaps Catwoman.

12
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,183
No, even Selina Kyle has
more regard for human life.

13
00:06:54,356 --> 00:06:56,324
This is someone entirely new, Alfred.

14
00:06:56,492 --> 00:06:59,427
The last thing Gotham needs
is a vigilante running amuck.

15
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:02,496
As they say on the streets,
''I ain't touching that one.''

16
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:05,724
The point is, her costume links her
to me. why?

17
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:08,392
what does she have planned?
How far will she go?

18
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,404
Do be careful. Remember, there are
many species in which the female...

19
00:07:12,574 --> 00:07:14,439
...is deadlier than the male.

20
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:44,432
He's been waiting.

21
00:08:30,352 --> 00:08:33,048
It still lists to the right.
See what you can do.

22
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:34,746
Penguin.

23
00:08:34,923 --> 00:08:38,689
Mr. Duquesne. I hear we had
an unpropitious setback.

24
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:41,193
If you mean we got hit, yeah.

25
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:44,423
And how exactly could that
have happened?

26
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,798
I don't know yet. No one but us even knew
the shipment was going out last night.

27
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:51,235
well, someone did.

28
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,309
-A Batwoman?
-That's what my man said, Thorne.

29
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,315
Batman, Batgirl, Batwoman!
what is it about this city? The water?

30
00:09:04,686 --> 00:09:06,847
Fortunately, it was only one truckload.

31
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:09,582
I've doubled the manpower
at our warehouse sites.

32
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,851
No way she can get to the rest.

33
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:15,758
Forgive me if I'm not so sanguine.

34
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:19,890
Our overseas consortium has paid us
a half-billion dollars for these arms.

35
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:23,970
If we don't deliver, they'll want their
money back. Since we've spent it...

36
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:27,006
...that would present a problem,
wouldn't it?

37
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:29,769
I want the rest of it to be out
within the week...

38
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,539
...which means take care
of this bat-clone now.

39
00:09:32,714 --> 00:09:38,050
You're supposed to be our muscle,
Mr. Duquesne. Start flexing.

40
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:03,067
well, someone talked!
Someone dropped a dime!

41
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:06,009
-we find out who, we'll find her.
-Daddy!

42
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:08,177
Hold on.

43
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:12,318
-where you been?
-Don't worry, Daddy.

44
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:16,321
I brought your lapdogs with me.
For once, they came in handy.

45
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,118
Shoo.

46
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:22,059
So Raoul, my favorite hairdresser,
had a spiritual rebirth last week...

47
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,596
...and left for an ashram in Bukittinggi.

48
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:28,497
-How was your day?
-You should tell me when you go out.

49
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,501
who's on the phone?

50
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,607
Business. Nothing for you
to worry about.

51
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:36,642
I guess I should be going then.

52
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:41,775
we're getting dangerously close
to a conversation.

53
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,014
Do whatever it takes. I want you
to find her. Find her and finish her!

54
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:56,354
Today on Bat-watch, everyone wonders
who the mysterious Batwoman could be.

55
00:10:56,531 --> 00:11:01,867
Batman's new partner? Batgirl grown up?
We asked Police Commissioner Gordon.

56
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,264
All I can say is,
she's not affiliated with Batman.

57
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,705
Otherwise, I have no comment.

58
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,708
Det. Bullock! Harvey!

59
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,712
I think we got enough bat-freaks
in Gotham already.

60
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,874
I mean, what's next? Bat-hound?

61
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,488
Come on, Bullock, throw us
a bone here, will you?

62
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,727
You know, I've been thinking about getting
a dog. He could help us sniff out clues.

63
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:32,558
-Bruce wayne here.
-Bruce, it's Barbara.

64
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,894
Hey, Barb.

65
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,799
-She misses you.
-How's college?

66
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:41,409
Not bad, though the nightlife here
can't compare with kicking butt as Batgirl.

67
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:46,513
But spring break'll be coming up soon, and
I'll be back in Gotham for two whole weeks.

68
00:11:46,682 --> 00:11:47,910
won't that be nice?

69
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:51,247
Yes, we'll all be happy to see you.

70
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,751
Don't drag me into this.

71
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,980
Anyway, that's not the reason I called.

72
00:11:55,157 --> 00:11:58,524
I just saw the news and was wondering
if you got a new partner.

73
00:11:58,694 --> 00:12:01,162
Someone a little older?

74
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:02,921
I have no idea who she is.

75
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,430
Because if you had,
I'd be really upset...

76
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,831
...because I thought you and I were,
you know....

77
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:13,441
Barb, we're going through
the East Tunnel now.

78
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:17,442
Afraid signal's breaking up.
Talk later.

79
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:21,880
Squeaked through again, didn't you?

80
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,019
I never fail to marvel
at your narrow escapes, sir.

81
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:28,054
One female bat at a time.

82
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,731
In discussing this new alloy,
I brought some charts...

83
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:42,302
...to demonstrate the care and precision
we bring to our work at wayne Tech.

84
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:49,976
So as you can see, the alloy's tensile
malleability is remarkably high...

85
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,909
...given its density
and homeotropic structure.

86
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:57,814
Meaning that the flexible
molecular stacking will...

87
00:12:58,253 --> 00:13:01,586
...provide considerable morphological
adaptability...

88
00:13:01,757 --> 00:13:05,488
...through the electromagnetic
manipulation of the quantum states!

89
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,102
See this chunk of metal?
I can program it to change shape.

90
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:29,114
-Oh, fantastic.
-That's fantastic.

91
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:36,446
I thought she said it was metal.

92
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,120
-Look at that.
-It's beautiful.

93
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:42,456
Just with one touch?

94
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:51,867
So exciting.

95
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,075
Actually, the technology's pretty simple.

96
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:04,116
It's just imprinting morph lines
with a pressure point.

97
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:08,052
-I'm not sure what it's good for.
-I happen to have a silent partner...

98
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,249
-...who I'm sure will find some use for it.
-That's great.

99
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:15,886
It's so cool to be in an R&D company
that takes young women seriously...

100
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,531
...especially blonds.

101
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:21,430
At wayne Tech, it's what's under
the hair that counts, Dr. Ballantine.

102
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:23,503
It's Rocky. Actually, Roxanne...

103
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:28,006
...but people have always called me
Rocky for some reason.

104
00:14:28,844 --> 00:14:30,778
Look! It's the bat signal!

105
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:32,846
-where?
-Right there!

106
00:14:33,014 --> 00:14:35,448
what's going on over there?

107
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:39,018
wow! I've never seen it before!
Isn't it exciting?

108
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:41,917
Every time. Check.

109
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:54,224
He'll get here. And remember,
when he does, I'll do the talking.

110
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:05,577
what is it, commissioner?

111
00:15:05,747 --> 00:15:09,148
I had Bullock collect the remains
of the contraband destroyed.

112
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:12,115
I thought you might like to take a look.

113
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:17,654
Stuff's out of Star Trek. I thought
maybe someone broke into a toy store.

114
00:15:17,826 --> 00:15:20,659
These aren't toys, Bullock.
This is a plasma rifle.

115
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:22,956
It could take out a tank at 200 yards.

116
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,259
More like 500.
I measured the clip size.

117
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:28,994
Sonia Alcana, Bullock's new partner.

118
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,436
There are also EK4 lasers and a barrel
from a surface-to-air missile launcher.

119
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:36,406
-who's behind this?
-The truck driver ain't talking...

120
00:15:36,578 --> 00:15:39,877
...but I got some leads. Can't say
anything definite right now.

121
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:41,913
we have nothing.

122
00:15:42,717 --> 00:15:45,151
-where'd you get this?
-From the guy's truck...

123
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,584
...when I had it impounded.

124
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:49,990
I'll get back to you.

125
00:15:53,094 --> 00:15:56,928
what's got his tights in a twist?

126
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,601
Penguin owns this place?

127
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:12,440
Along with Duquesne and Thorne.

128
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,946
-what do they make here?
-Trinkets, figurines...

129
00:16:16,117 --> 00:16:20,850
...weapons of mass destruction.
I don't see any of his goons around.

130
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:35,292
There she is!

131
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:41,699
See her?

132
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,641
Over there!

133
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:09,668
So you like to play rough, huh, sweetie?

134
00:17:15,477 --> 00:17:17,468
welcome to superhero team-up!

135
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,510
Get them!

136
00:17:20,348 --> 00:17:22,282
Come on!

137
00:17:34,996 --> 00:17:36,725
-You shouldn't be here.
-Likewise.

138
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:38,866
No. I mean, I've set a charge.

139
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:40,865
where?

140
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,260
Below us.

141
00:17:44,706 --> 00:17:46,640
A munitions room.

142
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,256
Let's get out of here!

143
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,471
where'd she go?

144
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,465
Up there!

145
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,414
Let's move!

146
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,832
They were making arms for Kasnia...

147
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:54,441
...something the State Department would
frown upon. This was their weapons plant.

148
00:18:57,412 --> 00:19:01,974
-It would be a little hard to prove that now.
-Doesn't matter. They were finished here.

149
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,516
But I've just begun.

150
00:19:04,953 --> 00:19:07,114
who are you? why are you doing this?

151
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:10,553
You're the great detective. Figure it out.

152
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,728
Gotta jet.

153
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,940
who? The Batwoman?

154
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:13,019
what do you mean it's gone?
The whole building?

155
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:32,070
You got a lot of nerve, freak!

156
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,539
You and your woman have caused me
enough grief for one night.

157
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:40,443
It's my home, my family! Get out!

158
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,464
I heard a commotion last night.
who was here?

159
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,868
Nobody.

160
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:06,005
Did nobody do that too?

161
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,901
Nothing for you to worry about.

162
00:21:09,244 --> 00:21:10,734
As if I ever.

163
00:21:10,912 --> 00:21:13,005
-where you going?
-Nowhere.

164
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:17,350
Do they have to come?

165
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:19,315
Just for the next couple days.

166
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:23,617
I'm having trouble with some people.
I don't want you to have any problems.

167
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:27,326
You mean like Mama problems?

168
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:31,261
You live under my roof in my town.
You do what I say!

169
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,597
Fetch.

170
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,668
That's her.

171
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,839
Exactly what is it you hope
to discover?

172
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,680
what a beautiful young woman does
in her free time.

173
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,788
A pleasure drive then.

174
00:22:00,728 --> 00:22:04,186
I see why Dennis the Menace
is one step closer to juvenile hall.

175
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:08,529
-How many stores does this make so far?
-Including the nail boutique, seven.

176
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:11,797
And not one sale on explosives.

177
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,941
You know, Alfred, I think I could use
a new watch.

178
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,305
You deserve it, sir.

179
00:22:29,824 --> 00:22:33,885
Brown taffeta? what are they thinking?

180
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:41,767
It's a dressing room! The worst that
can happen is, I'll need a size 8!

181
00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:45,269
why don't you go rob gift wrap
or something?

182
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:50,172
I miss working for The Joker.

183
00:22:54,182 --> 00:22:57,674
-Sir, could you help me?
-Sorry, I don't work here.

184
00:22:57,852 --> 00:23:02,949
No, not that. See those men?
I'd rather they not see me.

185
00:23:03,124 --> 00:23:06,355
If you could just help me get
to the escalator....

186
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:12,562
Okay. Usually, you only see things
like this in the movies.

187
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:16,096
Hey, wait! Miss Duquesne!

188
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,135
who's she with?

189
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:26,012
Keep going.

190
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,276
Oh, dear.

191
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,649
You're good.

192
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,152
Here they come.

193
00:24:08,456 --> 00:24:12,916
Hurry, get in. Unless you want
that lovely face rearranged.

194
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:16,989
-Hey, stop!
-You crazy?

195
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:31,709
-who were they?
-Daddy's bodyguards.

196
00:24:34,282 --> 00:24:36,876
You've just run off
with a very notorious woman.

197
00:24:37,051 --> 00:24:39,884
I'm Kathy Duquesne,
daughter of Carlton Duquesne.

198
00:24:40,288 --> 00:24:41,482
The gangster?

199
00:24:41,656 --> 00:24:45,387
Yes, but we try not to use
the G word in front of Daddy.

200
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,402
This is interesting.
I think we're being followed.

201
00:24:57,572 --> 00:25:02,475
Doesn't look like Daddy's goon squad.
Hope you're not expected anywhere.

202
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:10,249
You're on your own, Master Bruce.

203
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:22,662
we having fun yet?

204
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:44,010
Bruce wayne?

205
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:45,747
what a photo op!

206
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,788
The most respected man in Gotham with
the daughter of the most disrespected.

207
00:25:49,957 --> 00:25:52,653
Your father has a lot of competition
for that title.

208
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:56,661
I know. Most of them come to dinner
from time to time.

209
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:01,493
I used to wonder what it's like to come
from a respectable family...

210
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:05,662
...where there's no violence,
no vendettas, no victims.

211
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,808
what must that feel like?

212
00:26:07,975 --> 00:26:10,569
I wish I could tell you.

213
00:26:10,745 --> 00:26:12,337
It must feel like freedom.

214
00:26:12,713 --> 00:26:14,442
Kathy, be careful.

215
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:19,712
You sound like my mama. ''Be careful,
Kathy. Don't go scaring me, girl.''

216
00:26:20,888 --> 00:26:24,119
This was our favorite spot.
we used to come out here to paint.

217
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:27,557
She was a great artist.
She said I had the eye.

218
00:26:27,728 --> 00:26:32,062
She said, ''Honey, you could be
another Carrie Mae weems.''

219
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,100
what happened?

220
00:26:34,268 --> 00:26:36,395
what happened?

221
00:26:36,571 --> 00:26:39,404
She died. Isn't that
what always happens?

222
00:26:39,574 --> 00:26:41,064
I'm sorry.

223
00:26:41,242 --> 00:26:43,142
Everyone's sorry.

224
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:45,745
It doesn't make any difference.

225
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:24,610
Here. Bring it back sometime.
Or not. There's always plenty more.

226
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,622
Down, boys.

227
00:28:02,823 --> 00:28:07,260
I met Batwoman. She confirmed they were
making the weapons at Penguin's factory.

228
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:10,056
-who is she?
-I think Carlton Duquesne's daughter.

229
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:13,098
Remember the assassination attempt
on him 1 0 years ago?

230
00:28:13,267 --> 00:28:16,532
Yeah, they missed him.
Hit his wife instead.

231
00:28:16,704 --> 00:28:20,265
I think Kathy Duquesne blames her father
for that and a lot more.

232
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:22,966
Come on, she'd be biting
the hand that feeds her.

233
00:28:23,144 --> 00:28:25,237
Think of the dough her old man has.

234
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:27,608
You can't buy peace of mind, Bullock.

235
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:29,647
Let's keep a tail on her.

236
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:40,359
I see Miss Duquesne is gifted
in other sports besides extreme shopping.

237
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:43,827
This bodes well for your suspicions,
does it not, Master Bruce?

238
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:45,863
Yes, Alfred.

239
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:56,033
-what's with him?
-I think he has some affection for this one.

240
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,944
He sure can pick them.

241
00:29:14,228 --> 00:29:18,062
Relax, Penguin. we were gonna torch
the place for the money anyway.

242
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:22,692
I don't think you appreciate
the precariousness of our perch, Thorne...

243
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,634
...especially now that we have no factory!

244
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:29,469
If we're unable to deliver the rest
of our stockpile, we're dead.

245
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:32,305
The Kasnians will come after us
like wolverines.

246
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,970
we'll be begging for prison.

247
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:36,708
Duquesne says he can handle
the bat-broad.

248
00:29:36,884 --> 00:29:39,978
She almost killed Batman,
for heaven's sake!

249
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:42,418
Normally, I would find
that commendable...

250
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,821
...but now it just proves
that Duquesne is out of his league.

251
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,894
we need some real muscle.

252
00:30:24,265 --> 00:30:28,861
whoever you want to bring in,
Penguin, is fine with me.

253
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,780
I can't believe this!

254
00:30:43,617 --> 00:30:46,051
who are they getting?
who's better than you?

255
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,211
Penguin's not saying.

256
00:30:51,192 --> 00:30:53,422
Get out. Get out!

257
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:05,331
First you click on the red crystal, then
the blue, then hold down the shift key.

258
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,603
whoa! You got in!

259
00:31:15,382 --> 00:31:17,441
I've raided a few tombs in my time.

260
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:21,246
She found the secret bonus level
to ''Death Castle 3000'' !

261
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:24,619
Nobody at school can figure it out.
The guys are gonna flip.

262
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:29,758
So is Alfred. He's been waiting
in the car for you all this time.

263
00:31:30,164 --> 00:31:31,791
Thanks.

264
00:31:33,534 --> 00:31:35,399
-working late again?
-Yeah.

265
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:39,403
Fortunately, my boyfriend
is very understanding. what about yours?

266
00:31:39,573 --> 00:31:43,839
Girlfriend! I mean, of course girlfriend.
After all, considering your reputation.

267
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:47,742
Not that it's bad or anything or any
of my business, because it's not.

268
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:50,475
I was just curious.
How red is my face?

269
00:31:50,985 --> 00:31:53,681
Crimson. And no, I don't
have anybody special.

270
00:31:53,854 --> 00:31:56,846
Am I that forgettable, Bruce?

271
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,530
I've managed to lose my shadows
for a while...

272
00:32:05,699 --> 00:32:07,860
...and I thought I'd paint the town red.

273
00:32:08,035 --> 00:32:11,266
want to come along
and empty a few spray cans?

274
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:18,305
Excuse me, Kathy Duquesne,
Roxanne Ballantine.

275
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:21,448
-Pleased to meet you.
-Yes, I'm sorry.

276
00:32:21,615 --> 00:32:24,550
-About what?
-I don't know.

277
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:38,496
So you never got married, huh?

278
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:41,726
Hard to believe. Here she comes.

279
00:32:41,902 --> 00:32:46,032
well, what do you know?
It's the trash picking up the trash.

280
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:45,531
Hey, K.D.

281
00:33:45,699 --> 00:33:47,929
Looking hot.

282
00:33:48,602 --> 00:33:51,594
You got some fries with that shake?

283
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:58,009
I know, not exactly
the book-club crowd.

284
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:04,515
-I suppose you know who owns this place.
-She should. I bought her her first parasol.

285
00:34:04,685 --> 00:34:06,152
-Kathleen.
-Ozzie.

286
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,585
And Mr. wayne.
It's been quite a while, hasn't it?

287
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:12,624
Yes. The last time was when
you stole plutonium...

288
00:34:12,793 --> 00:34:16,092
...from one of my labs
and threatened to blow up the city.

289
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:20,666
Oh, yes, my more
rambunctious days.

290
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:23,129
Sir, your call just came in.

291
00:34:23,303 --> 00:34:27,137
The vagaries of a restaurateur.
You understand.

292
00:34:29,043 --> 00:34:31,170
Didn't know you and Penguin
had issues.

293
00:34:31,345 --> 00:34:34,109
It's not the bird
that's bothering me, it's you.

294
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,647
-what kind of game are you playing?
-Game?

295
00:34:36,817 --> 00:34:39,945
You dump your guards for a night,
and where do you go?

296
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,782
A club where the patrons
are your father's cronies.

297
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:45,652
It's like you want him to hear about it.

298
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:50,593
I'm not sure I like your tone.
I think I'll decide in the powder room.

299
00:34:58,272 --> 00:35:02,504
So you've already landed. Splendid.
How soon before we can commiserate?

300
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,837
I can drop by your club tonight.
I assume you have a back entrance.

301
00:35:07,014 --> 00:35:11,451
Oh, yes. I use it so much,
I'm thinking of installing a revolving door.

302
00:35:11,618 --> 00:35:13,415
See you then.

303
00:35:14,455 --> 00:35:18,824
-I said I wasn't to be disturbed.
-Oh, am I disturbing you?

304
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,324
Can't have that, can we?

305
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:33,138
How dare you? Release me at once,
you harridan, or I'll--

306
00:35:33,307 --> 00:35:34,399
They're constricting.

307
00:35:34,575 --> 00:35:39,740
They'll slice a penguin like a turkey,
unless you tell me who your new player is.

308
00:35:55,062 --> 00:35:58,327
who, Penguin?
who's the big, bad boogeyman?

309
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:01,296
I can't hear you.

310
00:36:01,468 --> 00:36:04,869
-Bane.
-Bane?!

311
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,484
No, run this way.

312
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:08,795
A bat-seeking missile for you, my dear.

313
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,383
You hear that?

314
00:37:25,085 --> 00:37:26,245
Call for backup!

315
00:37:35,562 --> 00:37:38,122
Time to burn a bat.

316
00:38:15,569 --> 00:38:19,232
Come on, let's see those
pointy little ears.

317
00:38:36,556 --> 00:38:38,217
-Stay together, come on.
-Hurry!

318
00:38:38,558 --> 00:38:40,549
It must've been a heck of a floorshow.

319
00:38:56,843 --> 00:39:00,779
I have to admit, not every date
I have ends with a police investigation.

320
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:04,906
You poor thing. Every time we're
together I seem to risk your life.

321
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:08,213
I'm sorry about tonight.
You were right about me.

322
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:11,050
No, no, don't say that.
I jumped to conclusions.

323
00:39:11,858 --> 00:39:17,387
I was wrong about you. And tonight....
Tonight turned out wonderfully.

324
00:39:20,934 --> 00:39:22,697
The old man wants you.

325
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:27,533
I'd invite you in, but I think
it's going to be chilly upstairs.

326
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:43,546
Souvenir?

327
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,787
I found it in the Penguin's club.

328
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:49,554
How about an autograph?
Make it a real collector's item.

329
00:39:51,398 --> 00:39:54,424
-what did you learn at the lounge?
-Other than the fact...

330
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,968
...that Kathy Duquesne
can't be Batwoman, not much.

331
00:39:58,138 --> 00:40:02,666
I found this in his office. I think
Batwoman used it on him. I kept a piece.

332
00:40:02,843 --> 00:40:05,869
You know removing evidence
from the scene of a crime is...

333
00:40:06,313 --> 00:40:08,679
...probably not gonna lose you
any sleep.

334
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:10,680
Call it a souvenir.

335
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:14,510
You saved my life once.

336
00:40:15,255 --> 00:40:19,282
Nine years ago. Arsonists,
they burned my parents' shop.

337
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:22,622
I was sleeping.
we lived on the second floor.

338
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:26,061
My room was filled with smoke.
I couldn't find the window.

339
00:40:26,233 --> 00:40:29,293
The floor was hot, flames shooting
between the floorboards.

340
00:40:29,836 --> 00:40:32,134
And then, there you were.

341
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:35,638
I remember. The arsonists
were working for Rupert Thorne.

342
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:39,301
Part of his protection racket.
The DA couldn't make the case stick.

343
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:42,773
Yeah, that's why I decided
to become a cop.

344
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:45,918
I just thought you should know.

345
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,401
That's tight. what's it mean?

346
00:41:03,603 --> 00:41:07,903
The wire from Penguin's office is identical
to the alloy Dr. Ballantine developed.

347
00:41:08,942 --> 00:41:12,605
Rocky? You think someone's
using her stuff?

348
00:41:22,656 --> 00:41:24,385
Arms up.

349
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:29,824
Proceed.

350
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:44,270
-Kevin, are you okay?
-No, Rocky, I'm not okay.

351
00:41:44,444 --> 00:41:46,844
I'm so far from okay,
I can't even see it.

352
00:41:47,013 --> 00:41:49,709
Don't give up. we're close.
Really close.

353
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:52,943
Once someone in Penguin's
organization is willing to talk--

354
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,713
You can't keep doing this.
It's too dangerous.

355
00:41:55,889 --> 00:42:00,189
-If Penguin finds out you're spying on him--
-He won't. I can take care of myself.

356
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:04,262
I'm not the wimp I used to be.
I've changed. I've had to.

357
00:42:04,431 --> 00:42:07,127
You'd have to be Supergirl
to stand a chance.

358
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,461
You don't know what I've been doing.

359
00:42:09,803 --> 00:42:14,206
Look, Rocky, I don't want
to see you anymore.

360
00:42:14,374 --> 00:42:18,435
-You aren't--
-Serious? I'm dead serious.

361
00:42:18,612 --> 00:42:21,775
I've got five more years here
before I get a shot at parole.

362
00:42:21,948 --> 00:42:24,644
It's stupid to waste your life
waiting for me.

363
00:42:24,818 --> 00:42:29,084
-It's my life. I can waste it any way I want.
-Don't come here again, Rocky.

364
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:32,157
-If you do, I won't see you.
-Kevin?

365
00:42:32,325 --> 00:42:35,317
Kevin, no! Listen to me.

366
00:42:35,495 --> 00:42:37,326
Kevin!

367
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:52,203
You have no new messages.

368
00:43:07,761 --> 00:43:10,821
-Batman?
-Nice moves for a computer geek.

369
00:43:10,997 --> 00:43:13,522
I used to-- I mean--
well, so what?

370
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,533
I took self-defense classes,
like millions of women.

371
00:43:16,703 --> 00:43:19,467
Now it's your turn.
why are you in my apartment?

372
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,470
Checking out your new designs.

373
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,973
They're beyond what you're doing
for wayne.

374
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:28,137
-You were--? You had no right to--
-where were you last night?

375
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:32,308
-I was at wayne Tech.
-You left by 7:00.

376
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:36,819
-well, I went for a walk.
-To the lceberg Lounge?

377
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:41,290
wait a minute, are you trying
to say I'm Batwoman? You're not serious.

378
00:43:41,461 --> 00:43:44,328
Recognize this? Batwoman used it.

379
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:48,126
It has the same configuration
as the alloy you developed for wayne Tech.

380
00:43:48,301 --> 00:43:51,668
So? I'm hardly the only one
working in metallurgy.

381
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:55,535
True, but you're the right body type.
And you have a motive.

382
00:43:55,709 --> 00:43:58,507
Your fiancé was framed
for smuggling by the Penguin.

383
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:01,340
And I know someone
broke into the Penguin's files.

384
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:05,644
Yeah? So what? Of course I'm trying
to get Kevin's sentence commuted...

385
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:09,118
...but I'm not doing anything illegal.
Here's a radical notion:

386
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:12,156
Instead of me, how about you
investigate the birdman?

387
00:44:12,325 --> 00:44:16,659
I bet there's lots more
incriminating evidence on his hard drives.

388
00:44:17,497 --> 00:44:21,126
This game you're playing has high stakes,
higher than you know.

389
00:44:21,301 --> 00:44:24,065
You could get hurt or worse.

390
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:27,899
You sound just like him.

391
00:44:38,418 --> 00:44:40,511
I checked the warehouses
this morning.

392
00:44:40,687 --> 00:44:43,884
-No reports of any trouble.
-Yet.

393
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:46,184
There's our cheerful associate.

394
00:44:52,098 --> 00:44:55,158
Shall we meet and greet, gentlemen?

395
00:45:15,655 --> 00:45:20,683
Penguin, I have reviewed your proposal
for my employment.

396
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,852
I'm sorry, but your terms
are not acceptable.

397
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:27,659
I want carte blanche,
complete control of the operation.

398
00:45:27,834 --> 00:45:29,131
I answer to no one.

399
00:45:29,302 --> 00:45:32,271
Now wait, you can't just
roll in here and give orders.

400
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:35,772
I just did, Se?or Duquesne.

401
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:48,810
Do not worry. If this Batwoman
attempts any interference at all....

402
00:45:53,727 --> 00:45:58,460
He has a way with words.
Now, shall we discuss the shipment?

403
00:45:58,765 --> 00:46:00,960
This time we have spared no expense.

404
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:07,266
we're using a luxury cruise liner
as our cover, and the ship sails tonight.

405
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:11,977
-what's the matter?
-The night you and I saw Batwoman...

406
00:46:12,178 --> 00:46:14,874
...Rocky Ballantine was working
late at wayne Tech.

407
00:46:15,048 --> 00:46:17,983
I knew she couldn't be Batwoman.
She's too nice.

408
00:46:18,384 --> 00:46:19,976
I was so sure this time.

409
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:22,383
well, she can't be
in two places at once...

410
00:46:22,555 --> 00:46:25,888
...unless she has the power
to duplicate herself.

411
00:46:27,794 --> 00:46:29,261
Robin, get on the computer.

412
00:46:29,429 --> 00:46:33,889
I need you to cross-reference all databases
on Kathy Duquesne and Roxanne Ballantine.

413
00:46:34,067 --> 00:46:37,059
Find anything that connects them.
Anything.

414
00:46:37,237 --> 00:46:40,695
-where are you going?
-To make a house call.

415
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:08,831
I've got it all: Their plans, the timetable,
the manpower, Bane's agenda--

416
00:47:09,002 --> 00:47:10,401
-He's onto me.
-what?

417
00:47:10,904 --> 00:47:13,236
Batman, he knows everything about me:

418
00:47:13,406 --> 00:47:17,843
where I work, what I do,
all about Kevin. It's uncanny.

419
00:47:18,011 --> 00:47:22,243
-So what?
-So what? He's gonna ruin everything!

420
00:47:22,415 --> 00:47:26,442
I told you we should've created
a new identity, not just spun it off him.

421
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:31,716
She's right, look at how fast he caught
onto me. we didn't count on this.

422
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:35,292
So he thinks you're Batwoman.
Two days ago he thought it was you.

423
00:47:35,461 --> 00:47:37,452
Tomorrow he'll think
it's someone else.

424
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:42,590
Trust me, if he really had any idea
what's going on, I would know.

425
00:47:42,769 --> 00:47:47,638
we are so close to our goal. we stop them
tonight, and we've broken them.

426
00:47:47,807 --> 00:47:49,934
-Tonight?
-They're moving that fast?

427
00:47:50,109 --> 00:47:55,445
Not fast enough for us, Rocky.
Never fast enough for us.

428
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:23,333
Somebody in here?

429
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:34,275
-Something wrong?
-Nope.

430
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:10,182
-Yes.
-I got some bad news for you.

431
00:49:10,356 --> 00:49:14,122
Or maybe good. There's no connection
between Kathy and Rocky.

432
00:49:15,194 --> 00:49:17,458
Different cities, circles and planets.

433
00:49:17,931 --> 00:49:20,263
No way they could've
known each other.

434
00:49:20,633 --> 00:49:22,601
Yes, there is.

435
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:25,738
All they needed was someone
to introduce them.

436
00:49:30,743 --> 00:49:33,041
Remember, once they load the ship...

437
00:49:33,212 --> 00:49:36,010
...Bane will station himself
in the pilot's cabin...

438
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:39,276
...with guards at checkpoints.
You get past this one...

439
00:49:39,452 --> 00:49:42,148
...and it's straight to the atrium
and the weapons.

440
00:49:42,322 --> 00:49:44,017
And the gift boutiques.

441
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:47,284
Kathy, the detonator
has a failsafe countdown.

442
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,758
I wouldn't shop too long.

443
00:49:50,263 --> 00:49:52,231
I guess this is it.

444
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,503
You sure you're gonna be all right?

445
00:50:01,674 --> 00:50:04,768
Don't worry, I'll be back.

446
00:51:18,918 --> 00:51:20,783
Se?orita.

447
00:51:39,105 --> 00:51:42,973
would you stop that infernal tapping?
In a few minutes the ship will be...

448
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:47,408
...in international waters,
and we'll be very rich men.

449
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,672
Gin.

450
00:51:52,585 --> 00:51:56,043
Yes. Yes, he's here. we're all here.

451
00:51:56,222 --> 00:51:57,985
She did?

452
00:51:58,357 --> 00:52:02,293
No. You want us now?

453
00:52:02,462 --> 00:52:04,362
-Is the shipment--?
-It's fine...

454
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:09,695
...but he's not leaving the harbor yet.
He has Batwoman.

455
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:13,539
Mustn't keep the lady waiting.

456
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:23,907
-Batman?
-You knew Kathy Duquesne.

457
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:26,483
-what?
-You both took art classes together.

458
00:52:26,652 --> 00:52:31,419
She sketched your face. It was years ago,
but it's you. Kathy had a good eye.

459
00:52:32,258 --> 00:52:34,749
-You also knew Rocky Ballantine.
-who?

460
00:52:34,927 --> 00:52:38,488
Let me jog your memory.
State University, freshman year.

461
00:52:38,664 --> 00:52:41,929
Same dorm, same floor, same room.

462
00:52:42,602 --> 00:52:44,035
You've been a busy bat.

463
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:47,263
You each brought something
to the party. Kathy had money...

464
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,967
...Rocky had the genius
and you had the scheme...

465
00:52:51,144 --> 00:52:52,839
...and the will to make it happen.

466
00:52:55,262 --> 00:52:59,358
when that fire destroyed my folks'
business, they never recovered.

467
00:52:59,533 --> 00:53:03,560
They'd worked their whole lives,
and then it was ashes, just like that.

468
00:53:03,737 --> 00:53:05,830
It tore our family apart.

469
00:53:06,006 --> 00:53:09,999
Everyone knew it was Rupert Thorne,
but there was no way to prove it.

470
00:53:10,177 --> 00:53:14,580
Now he's gonna know how it feels
to see his life go up in smoke.

471
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:20,978
Three Batwomen. It was just a matter
of disguising your voices and taking turns.

472
00:53:21,422 --> 00:53:25,825
And you know what? It almost worked.

473
00:53:26,393 --> 00:53:29,191
where is Kathy Duquesne?

474
00:53:35,169 --> 00:53:37,433
-I'm here.
-Something's definitely wrong.

475
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:40,073
There's no report
of any ship in distress.

476
00:53:40,241 --> 00:53:44,177
I radioed Kathy, but she's not responding.
She's in trouble, I can feel it.

477
00:53:44,345 --> 00:53:45,505
what're we gonna do?

478
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:49,415
Sonia?

479
00:54:29,723 --> 00:54:32,385
Olé, se?or. Exemplary work.

480
00:54:32,893 --> 00:54:36,260
I wanted you here
when I realized who she was.

481
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:38,990
I felt a certain caution was in order.

482
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:41,191
So who is she?

483
00:54:43,437 --> 00:54:46,497
-Kathy?
-what's going on, Duquesne?

484
00:54:46,674 --> 00:54:50,906
-No wonder she always knew our plans.
-what? You think I told her?

485
00:54:51,078 --> 00:54:53,171
She planned to use this.

486
00:54:53,347 --> 00:54:57,249
Don't let the size fool you, se?ores,
it's a carbonite bomb.

487
00:54:57,418 --> 00:54:59,852
It can take out this
entire chamber and more.

488
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,580
Are you crazy?
How could you do this to me?!

489
00:55:02,756 --> 00:55:06,954
It was easy, Daddy. You made it easy,
because of the kind of man you are.

490
00:55:07,127 --> 00:55:10,585
A man whose wife is killed
just because she stands next to him.

491
00:55:10,764 --> 00:55:13,790
The kind of man who makes a prison
out of his own house...

492
00:55:13,968 --> 00:55:15,833
...a prisoner out of his own child.

493
00:55:16,003 --> 00:55:19,166
The kind of man who spreads misery
to everything he touches.

494
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:22,776
-And for what? For them?!
-Shut up!

495
00:55:24,211 --> 00:55:27,271
-This doesn't make sense!
-On that we agree...

496
00:55:27,448 --> 00:55:30,679
...because I distinctly remember
your daughter at my lounge...

497
00:55:30,851 --> 00:55:32,910
...the same night Batwoman
assaulted me.

498
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:37,088
You're not in this alone,
are you, Kathleen?

499
00:55:37,491 --> 00:55:39,755
who else?

500
00:55:41,061 --> 00:55:43,029
Penguin, no!

501
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,294
No, don't!

502
00:55:47,468 --> 00:55:52,098
Tell me who else is involved
while Daddy still has a neck.

503
00:56:12,426 --> 00:56:16,362
Bon voyage, Se?or Batman.

504
00:56:55,502 --> 00:57:00,462
Bridge, head out to sea.
I want us in international waters now.

505
00:57:12,419 --> 00:57:16,515
-They're heading to sea. what do you think?
-Batman said he'd give a signal...

506
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:19,682
...but that doesn't mean
we can't take a closer look.

507
00:57:26,266 --> 00:57:27,597
You're out, Duquesne.

508
00:57:27,768 --> 00:57:30,168
I shouldn't have got mixed up
with you.

509
00:57:30,337 --> 00:57:34,467
well, that'll give you and your brat
something to talk about in family therapy.

510
00:57:34,641 --> 00:57:37,576
where's the bomb? wasn't it here?

511
00:57:45,085 --> 00:57:47,178
It's not over yet, amigo.

512
00:57:58,365 --> 00:58:00,799
-Here.
-I could've gotten out of them.

513
00:58:00,968 --> 00:58:03,198
No doubt, since you
got yourself into them.

514
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:07,136
Your friends are waiting to rescue you.
Let's not disappoint them.

515
00:58:09,443 --> 00:58:11,741
No, let's not.

516
00:58:15,382 --> 00:58:18,317
Don't! Break the magnets,
and it'll go off.

517
00:58:18,485 --> 00:58:20,817
There's no way to stop it
without the code...

518
00:58:20,988 --> 00:58:23,616
...which escapes me at the moment.

519
00:58:24,324 --> 00:58:28,192
I'm sorry, but one way
or another it has to end.

520
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:40,966
Even if she doesn't have the bomb I suggest
we act like cautious birds and head south.

521
00:58:41,475 --> 00:58:44,933
well, what do you know?
Our two favorite felons.

522
00:58:45,112 --> 00:58:47,239
Egads, they're multiplying.

523
00:58:53,987 --> 00:58:57,445
That felt so good.
Now where's Kathy Duquesne?

524
00:59:05,399 --> 00:59:06,866
Daddy!

525
00:59:26,353 --> 00:59:31,655
I knew sooner or later we would
face each other, Batman. I prayed for it.

526
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:34,293
This ship is going down
in less than a minute.

527
00:59:34,461 --> 00:59:37,521
That's all the time I need.

528
00:59:46,206 --> 00:59:48,037
Should've saved those prayers.

529
01:00:54,474 --> 01:00:57,466
-Abandon ship?
-You think?

530
01:00:59,212 --> 01:01:01,339
Let's go. Double-time it.
Come on now.

531
01:01:01,515 --> 01:01:04,382
-would you move it?
-Get over. I wanna get out of here.

532
01:01:04,551 --> 01:01:06,382
Let's get going. Get out of here!

533
01:01:07,487 --> 01:01:09,455
Come on, lower, lower, lower.

534
01:01:18,899 --> 01:01:20,196
Sonia!

535
01:02:01,108 --> 01:02:03,702
-I got her.
-Don't worry about me.

536
01:02:03,877 --> 01:02:05,936
Just get them!

537
01:03:51,251 --> 01:03:53,242
The ship's going down, Penguin.

538
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:57,857
Our only consolation is that
it will take a few bats with it.

539
01:04:00,627 --> 01:04:02,356
what?

540
01:04:43,036 --> 01:04:45,596
And I thought penguins liked the water.

541
01:05:35,889 --> 01:05:39,757
Estupido! No bonds can hold me!

542
01:05:41,828 --> 01:05:43,227
what?

543
01:05:45,565 --> 01:05:47,362
No!

544
01:05:53,873 --> 01:05:56,808
I can still crush you!

545
01:06:03,717 --> 01:06:05,241
No!

546
01:06:18,465 --> 01:06:20,126
No!

547
01:07:48,588 --> 01:07:49,953
Sonia?

548
01:07:54,427 --> 01:07:56,156
I've got you.

549
01:08:04,471 --> 01:08:08,134
Maybe I should write the report
this time, huh, Bullock?

550
01:08:33,933 --> 01:08:37,198
For what it's worth,
the city's losing a good cop.

551
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:39,338
Condoning vigilantes is one thing...

552
01:08:39,506 --> 01:08:42,475
...but even Com. Gordon
draws the line at employing them.

553
01:08:42,642 --> 01:08:45,236
we're just lucky the DA's
looking the other way.

554
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:47,778
Someday you'll have to tell me
how you do it.

555
01:08:47,947 --> 01:08:50,142
How you keep from crossing the line.

556
01:08:50,316 --> 01:08:53,410
when I put on the mask,
I couldn't even see the line.

557
01:08:53,787 --> 01:08:58,588
-Maybe I don't take it as personally.
-Somehow I doubt that.

558
01:09:00,894 --> 01:09:03,488
-where will you go?
-I'm not sure.

559
01:09:03,663 --> 01:09:07,997
Someplace simpler, where capes
aren't the prevailing fashion.

560
01:09:08,168 --> 01:09:12,798
-Don't tell me you came to wish me luck.
-That, and to give you this.

561
01:09:12,972 --> 01:09:17,841
Exculpatory evidence that should help
release Dr. Ballantine's fiancé from jail.

562
01:09:18,011 --> 01:09:21,742
-I thought it should come from you.
-I-- Thank you.

563
01:09:21,915 --> 01:09:24,110
I'm sure she'll appreciate it.

564
01:09:29,889 --> 01:09:31,789
I think I'm gonna miss that.

565
01:09:34,828 --> 01:09:39,128
I hated who he was, what he did,
the hurt he brought to people.

566
01:09:39,299 --> 01:09:42,564
But now that he's in here, I feel bad.

567
01:09:42,735 --> 01:09:46,899
At least we talk. He's making a deal
to testify against Thorne and Penguin.

568
01:09:47,073 --> 01:09:50,133
Maybe he hated his life
as much as you hated yours.

569
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:53,503
For a computer geek,
you're pretty smart.

570
01:09:54,214 --> 01:09:58,776
-By the way, how's Bruce?
-Mr. wayne? Fine, I guess.

571
01:09:58,952 --> 01:10:02,444
-You haven't heard from him?
-I think he's been reading the papers.

572
01:10:02,622 --> 01:10:04,453
Rocky!

573
01:10:05,124 --> 01:10:06,853
Rocky!

574
01:10:07,794 --> 01:10:09,318
Kevin!

575
01:10:10,196 --> 01:10:11,823
Kevin.

576
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:18,832
Kevin.

577
01:10:36,422 --> 01:10:40,222
-About time I returned this.
-what are you doing here?

578
01:10:40,593 --> 01:10:44,689
Funny thing. This morning I got up
thinking, ''Something's wrong.''

579
01:10:44,864 --> 01:10:49,631
And then I realized: No gunfire,
no explosions, no goons out to do me in.

580
01:10:49,802 --> 01:10:52,236
Everything was peaceful and quiet.

581
01:10:52,405 --> 01:10:56,364
And that's when I realized
how much I missed you.

582
01:10:57,377 --> 01:11:02,280
You poor thing. But that was the old
Kathy Duquesne. The new one is different.

583
01:11:02,448 --> 01:11:05,747
She intends to live a life
of complete respectability.

584
01:11:05,919 --> 01:11:09,013
-All the time?
-Afraid so.

585
01:11:14,294 --> 01:11:17,593
well, maybe an explosion now and then.

586
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,589
