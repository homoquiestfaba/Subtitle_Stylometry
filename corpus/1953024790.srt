00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,079
(player shouts)
Three!

2
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,582
Okay, first and ten
and Deon Barnes

3
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,294
on a roll with three
touchdowns and a
hundred yards rushing.

00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,713
He gets--yeah, yeah, hoo...

[crowd cheers loudly]

00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,762
Get it! Get it!
Get it! Get it!

00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,556
[wild shouting]

10
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,391
Good job!

11
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,394
You know you got it!
Yeah, you know you got it!

12
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,313
Oh, that's my boy.

13
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,397
Coach.

14
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,066
Huh.

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,901
We're up
by so much.

16
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,403
Do you think we could
put my brother in
the game?

17
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,572
Yeah, Sean Barnes,
you're in, come on!

18
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:16,325
Sean! Your glasses!

19
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,910
Come on!

20
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,578
Come on out, Jimmy.
Good job, buddy.

21
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,163
(male voice)
Let's go, come on.

22
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,498
Coach wants
a 34 dive.
Sean, you okay?

23
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,582
I'm okay.

24
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,000
Ready?
Right!

25
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,586
Get in there, baby!
Go for it!

26
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,505
(player)
Three!

27
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,506
(Coach)
Come on, boys!

28
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,008
Set!
Hut!

29
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,345
[shouts of disappointment]

30
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,181
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

31
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,058
[shouting]

32
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,697
Come on.
Okay, come on.

33
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,201
Come on, baby boy.
Come on.

34
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:06,667
[indistinct]

35
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,629
Come on.
Yeahhh.

36
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,172
Blue and gold!

37
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,465
Hut!

38
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,470
[loud thud]

39
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,972
[groans]

40
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:20,931
Oh!

41
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,645
- Can I get a--
- Hold on.

42
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:29,481
You don't get a drink until
we win or go into overtime.

43
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,358
- I just want a beer.
- Uh-uh! Look.

44
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,360
You come into my bar
on a Saturday afternoon

45
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,404
you'd better order
your drinks before
or at half time,

46
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,698
but when the game is on,
nobody interrupts. Okay.

47
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,992
Hey! Bee's bar.

48
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,535
My bad, y'all.

49
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,036
35 seconds left.
Let's bring it up!

50
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,955
I want it! I want it!
I'm ready.

51
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,210
[silent praying]

52
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,047
Hut!

53
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,181
[loud thud]

54
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,101
[group cheers]

55
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,731
(group chanting)
Fourteen! Fourteen!

56
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,524
(Bee)
Who is that?

57
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,067
That's my baby!

58
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,444
There's more action
from the dealer.

59
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,196
When will it
be turned around?

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,698
Man, you see I'm watching
the game here, Sean.

61
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,533
When you gonna sell
this old 'vette of yours?

62
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,327
When I feel like giving
you a commission.

63
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,204
Now sit down and watch
your brother play ball.

64
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,122
I can't mess around.
I'm up for promotion.

65
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,041
Hey, you think I can get
a ride back?

66
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,210
Sean, I'm watching
the game. C'mon!

67
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,711
Jeez, man.

68
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,923
Watch this, watch this!

69
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,217
Do it D.
Do it D.

70
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,885
You have to watch this.

71
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,261
Oh, yeah!
Do it D!

72
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,389
Timeout! Blue.

73
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,599
Time out!

74
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,475
Shut the fuck up!

75
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,560
Damn!

76
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,687
(announcer)
...back on their
eleven yard line.

77
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,315
Raise that hand again
and they gonna be calling
you Stubby.

78
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,692
Yeah, and don't think
she's playing around.

79
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,902
I've seen that
action before.

80
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,075
Let's go Twizz left,
80 to slice...

81
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,493
Stop running
that bullshit.

82
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,953
The line is
too strong.

83
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,246
All right.
Fuck it!

84
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,206
Line, let 'em come through.

85
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,417
We'll hit 'em with base,
Seattle Blue, on one
on one.

86
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,335
All right!

87
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,711
[whistle]

88
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,383
Set!

89
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:22,928
Hut!

90
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,814
[yelling]
C'mon!

91
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:40,946
[loud thud]

92
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:52,165
[whooping, cheering]

93
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,593
Hey! Hey, could I get
that ride?

94
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,687
Right now, Bernie's
gonna buy you
a beer.

95
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,314
- Wow!
- Yeah!

96
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,482
Gimme some dap.

97
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,360
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

98
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,154
One, two, three, D!

99
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,156
Hit the showers.
Good game!

100
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,534
Deon, a word.

101
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,328
I just wanted
a quick word with you.

102
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,998
[laughs]

103
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,666
I'm gonna
make this quick.

104
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,752
I don't want to put you
on the spot.

105
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,504
You did something tonight
that was really
wonderful to see.

106
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,631
You showed
tremendous character.

107
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,967
Don't ever forget it.
You won the game for us

108
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,011
without scoring touchdowns.

109
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,472
I want you to know
that every sportscaster
in the country,

110
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,391
from ESPN , CBS
is gonna be showing
highlights of this game

111
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,811
and they're gonna
be showing you
taking people out.

112
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,189
Because of that,
I'd like you
to have this game ball.

113
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,524
I want you to take it
to the N FL with you

114
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,069
and put it on your shelf
and then invite me over,
so I can...

115
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,030
hang out in your big house,
pretend it's mine.

116
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,073
All right?

117
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,824
Thanks, Coach.

118
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,951
You have a good time, tonight.
Not too good.

119
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,555
Four three.

120
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,349
What's that?

121
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,643
What was your fastest
time off the line tonight?

122
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,438
Because, uh,
I ran a 4-3-40.

123
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,982
I was All State
in three different sports.

124
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,609
Come on, we heard
this before.

125
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,736
Then why didn't you
take it?

126
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,613
You got all these
scouts in the stands

127
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,907
taking down your stats
every night.

128
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,160
Deon, you see
the endzone
in your sight,

129
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,079
you take it.

130
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:58,834
Don't throw your
opportunity away,
like I did mine.

131
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,337
You got one season
left at this university.

132
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,340
You don't
forget that.

133
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,093
We won the game.

134
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:13,598
Son, I didn't have
anyone watching
my back

135
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:17,018
who knew the game.

136
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:22,149
I'm watching your back.
Okay?

137
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,817
You go have fun.

138
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,611
And you party, but
keep your nose clean.

139
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,530
And your dick clean.
I know yo' ass.

140
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,698
Huh?

141
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,074
Yes, sir.

142
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,367
Yeah, I'm
watching yo' ass.

143
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,997
[rap music]

144
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,216
You were amazing tonight.

145
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,968
Alright, alright, how?

146
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,887
How did you see
that shit out there, man?

147
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,014
You had two
guys on you.

148
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,516
Man, you boys
never play flea flicker
when you was a kid, man?

149
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,060
We been running the same
plays since peewee leagues.

150
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,396
We took the ball
every practice.

151
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,315
See how many times
you make it change hands
before we cross the goal.

152
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,941
No shit?

153
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,860
I had two choices
out there tonight.

154
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,778
I coulda held
onto the ball
and went down with it,

155
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,489
or when my quarterback is
running on the right,

156
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,574
I flick that ball out
and we in the end zone!

157
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,075
[all laugh]

158
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,411
It was incredible
to see you.

159
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,580
But I didn't see it.

160
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,998
No, you
didn't see it?

161
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,917
You had
too much
to drink.

162
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,504
[rap music]

163
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,604
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

164
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:46,024
I overheard y'all
conversation and I got
one question to ask.

165
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,527
Are you all here
for the love of Deon?

166
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,945
You're friends
with Deon?

167
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,404
Hell, yeah.

168
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,073
Y'all wanna

169
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,367
Ya gotta dance

170
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,952
Well--

171
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,745
He wants to dance.
You wanna dance?

172
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,789
Let's make it happen.
Come on, we at
a party.

173
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,706
Okay.

174
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,250
Come on.

175
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,710
Oh, I like

176
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,130
Hold on.
Let's make
a sandwich.

177
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,884
Five dollar.

00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,971
I'm interracial datin'.

179
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,890
(Deon)
That's my motherfuckin'
man showing off.

180
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,559
That's my boy
right there.

181
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,769
[all laugh]

182
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,980
That's why we win
the motherfucking
games, man.

183
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,066
[all laugh]

184
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,317
That's why we won.

185
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,485
Yeah.

186
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,903
Yo, Sean.

187
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,738
Yeah?

188
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,949
Yo.
Hi, man.

189
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,243
What's up, man.

190
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,494
It's a party, man,
enjoy yourself.

191
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,996
I know,
I'm fine.

192
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,372
I knew you was
gonna be here.

193
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,707
Congratulations
on the game.

194
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,750
Yeah, that
went good.

195
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,794
Yeah, I'm gonna leave.
This ain't my scene.

196
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:52,591
What you need to do
is take care of this
shit right here.

197
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,926
Turn you into
a up and comer.

198
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,845
That way one of these
bitches around here

199
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,848
keep you up and coming.
Know what I'm
talking about?

200
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,600
Nah, that's alright.

201
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,644
Man, fuck
this shit, man.
Fuck beer, man.

202
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,105
Man made beer.
God made weed.

203
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,482
[laughter]

204
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,610
See them little
bitches over there?

205
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,111
Yeah.

206
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,613
Like 'em?
They're something.

207
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,406
Yeah.

208
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,951
Excuse me, sweethearts,
I told y'all, come here.

209
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,369
Yeah.

210
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,580
[music]

211
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:27,042
We can go upstairs and be away
from all this noise,
if you want.

212
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,794
[inaudible]

213
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,921
Okay, let's go.

214
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,057
It's that easy when you
the big bad ole cat.

215
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,225
I'll holler.

216
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,935
[rap music]

217
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,699
[romantic music]

218
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,372
(Deon)
Mm.

219
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,792
Mm.

220
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,299
(coach)
Go.

221
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,352
Nine five.
Nine nine.
Eleven one.

222
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,523
Come on.

223
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,778
That's good,
that's good.

224
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,031
That's not bad.

225
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,283
Come on, get up.
Open up your chest.
Get air.

226
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,785
[groan]

227
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,495
Are you alright?

228
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,956
Yeah, probably just
a little dehydrated.

229
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,165
You wanna quit?

230
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,710
Hell no.
Reset that.

231
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:56,089
[chuckles]
I thought so.
Alright, and--go!

232
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,805
High step dancing now.

233
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,640
Okay, as
Ben Jones said,

234
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,476
American jobs are jobs
installing insulation,

235
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,062
putting in solar paneling,
putting in weather proofing,

236
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,440
and we have to decide
do we want to support

237
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,401
a dirty fossil fuel industry
or a clean green one

238
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,278
where are the jobs
gonna be?

239
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,739
Drill, baby, drill, becomes
spill, baby, spill.

240
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,158
Well, that's what I say.
What do you say?

241
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,493
There's no clean
green coal,
come on.

242
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,912
It's an illusion.
Poof.

243
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,094
(June)
[inaudible]

244
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,805
Man, what we coming
up in here for?

245
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,016
Gonna get
something to drink.

246
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,311
ln a bookstore is
the last place a nigga
like me is trying to be.

247
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,772
(Deon)
Yo.

248
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,857
Yo, what you
doing in here, brother?

249
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,776
We've been looking
all over for you, man.

250
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,110
We gonna get lunch.

251
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,154
Y'all go ahead,
I'm busy.

252
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,198
I know what he in here
trying to do.

253
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:07,202
He wanna holler
at that baby.

254
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,539
That's what you was doing?

255
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:16,836
[laughs]
She ain't got no ass.

256
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,005
You like that?
I got you.

257
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,465
D.

258
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,718
He gonna hit
your girl.

259
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,553
[tapping]

260
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:30,683
Can I have some
assistance, please?

261
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,019
I'm just playing.
How you doing?
My name is Deon.

262
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,562
- Sharon.
- Nice to meet you.

263
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,939
You like football, Sharon?

264
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,024
Yeah.

265
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,984
We got a big
game coming up
this weekend.

266
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,654
[muttering]

267
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,989
Never mind him,
he's crazy.

268
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:50,495
But if you like, I'd
like you to be my
special guest.

269
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,540
Okay.
Yeah.

270
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,084
So if you write your number
down and I can...

271
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,752
know how to get
in contact with you

272
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,087
to get you
you the tickets.

273
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,680
Okay, Sharon.

274
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,190
I can't believe
you fucking
did that, man.

275
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:24,237
What? Here, man,
I got it for you.

276
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:28,157
Yo, this bitch last
night, her ass
was like this!

277
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,952
I'm telling you,
she was standing
up off her back

278
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,121
like this, whoa!

279
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,039
Y'all did
the ass hash bash.

280
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:39,794
I love
a tiger body
pussy, great.

281
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,629
I'm gonna pass
on lunch.

282
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,131
Catch up with
you guys later.

283
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,299
Alright. Hey, don't
forget Sunday.

284
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,550
Mom's expecting us.

285
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,135
Yeah, I'll
be there.

286
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,555
Your brother's a
fucking weirdo, dude.

287
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:54,726
He can't even come
to places when we
go places, shit dog.

288
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,728
He don't wanna
go with us anyway.

289
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,812
Good.

290
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,442
[rap music]

291
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,570
Mm, mm, mm.

292
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:12,243
Just a little more
hot sauce.

293
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,161
Hey.

294
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,583
You smell good.

295
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,251
Well, baby,
you don't.

296
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,420
You gotta go wash
the gasoline
off of you.

297
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,088
BMW, Black
Man Working,

298
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,507
that's a good thing
in this economy.

299
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,635
You like that.

300
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,345
Ten seconds left, last
play of the game, y'all
ready for this?

301
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,638
Yeah.

302
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,972
You with me,
little man?

303
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,307
All right,
check it out.

304
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,351
You ready?

305
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,437
Getcha all pumped up.
Who wanna go out,
who wanna go long?

306
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,022
(tall boy)
Throw me
the ball.

307
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,440
(boy)
You ain't
gotta push.

308
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,193
Shut up.

309
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:49,030
Alright, go ahead,
go long.

310
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,784
Alright, you can run
faster than that.
Come on, man, run.

311
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:57,872
I'm gonna hit you
at the hump.
Go ahead, run.

312
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,624
Here, y'all
take the ball.

313
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,376
Don't let him push
you around, man.

314
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,336
Yeah.

315
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,135
Oh, and please,
get that scarf
off your head.

316
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,221
Or you will not
get the result
you want tonight.

317
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,390
You gonna
play the p-card with me?

318
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,557
I'm just saying.

319
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,314
Get your hands outta--
what am I gonna do
with you!

320
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,233
Didn't even hurt.

321
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,402
I know she was trying
to show me love
and affection.

322
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,404
You see that? You
see what he's saying?

323
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,572
He's saying he gets
away with it. You
spoil him.

324
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,615
And I don't.

325
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,409
That is my son.

326
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,994
That's my problem
with women.

327
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,538
I always put them up
against my mom

328
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,872
and they don't
stand a chance.

329
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,166
Oh, that's my baby.

330
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,334
[kissing sounds]

331
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,336
That's right.

332
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,839
Do--do--do you
know the song
"My Girl"?

333
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,758
You should sing that.
This here is my girl.

334
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,468
All right,
all right.

335
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,178
Dinner's in ten minutes.
Get your brother.

336
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,513
All right.

337
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,432
You get the shower.

338
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,558
Later.

339
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,059
Would you please.

340
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,352
Halftime is
my time. I'll wash up.

341
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,186
Please.

342
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,563
Okay.

343
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,898
And put on that
cologne I like.

344
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,027
Wait until you taste,
baby, this cheddar
corn bread, baby.

345
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,611
You gonna love me
all over again.

346
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,114
I like what
I'm seeing.

347
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,991
Ooh.

348
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:18,953
[knocking]

349
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,788
Yaho.

350
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,957
Buddy, what it do,
big homie.

351
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,709
What up.

352
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,753
Man, I came over here
so we can go to the mall,

353
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,713
and I can get at
some bitches.

354
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,381
What do you need me
to go with you for?

355
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,133
I don't need
you to come.

356
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,969
A good pimp
need an assistant.
Go get the car.

357
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,096
Hey, June. I don't
know where you
gonna put

358
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,723
this third helping.

359
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,641
Aw, man.

360
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,894
[sniffing]

361
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,646
June, why in the hell do
you come in my house
smelling like that?

362
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,648
What?

363
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,942
But this is
my special cologne.

364
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,529
What? New Cannabis
Cold Water?

365
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,906
No, it works.

366
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,492
The hood rats
love it.

367
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,327
Ms. Barnes, you think
I can get a plate too?

368
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,496
You can go in and
make yourself a plate.

369
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,538
Please?

370
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,127
Thank you.

371
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,131
Hey, man, your
momma got wild.

372
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,425
Don't be looking
at my momma
like that.

373
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,718
Just playing.

374
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,303
I ain't playing
with you.

375
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,639
Aw, shit.
Here come Poindexter.

376
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,390
Hey, Sean.

377
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,268
You gonna chill
and watch the game
with us?

378
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:30,650
Okay.

379
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:34,112
What about that girl?
You call her?

380
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,113
No.

381
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,489
Why not?

382
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,907
I didn't feel
right about it.

383
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,450
I mean, how
would that look?

384
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,868
Me calling after
you talked to her?

385
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:45,540
What?
What the fuck?

386
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,042
Man, you shoulda
gave me the number.

387
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,503
Your brother don't
want no pussy.

388
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,964
Sittin' up with in
motherfucker reading books

389
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,507
playing love jeopardy.

390
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,633
I did not want
to fuck that bitch--

391
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,843
Fuck you, man.

392
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:57,885
What?

393
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,178
Yo, chill out.

394
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,638
Say that
one more time.

395
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,681
He didn't mean
nothing by it.

396
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,141
One more time!

397
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,475
One more time
for what?

398
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,310
What is going
on in here?

399
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,062
Baby, are
you all right?

400
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,480
I'm all right,
I'm all right.

401
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,649
He pushed me
over the table.

402
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,984
Why you do
that, Sean?

403
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,652
What if he
hurt himself?

404
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,154
No matter,
you always
take his side.

405
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,072
This is not sides, baby.

406
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,240
You coulda hurt your brother,
you coulda hurt yourself.

407
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,159
It's nothing.

408
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,869
It's over some girl he like
and I got her phone number

409
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,621
and I asked him if he called
and he got mad.

410
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,001
Sean, what
are you thinking?

411
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,087
We got the biggest
game of your brother's
career coming up.

412
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,673
Now what if he cut
himself on that glass.

413
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,758
What if he didn't play
to his fullest

414
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,178
in front of all the scouts
that we know are
gonna be there.

415
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,764
Your actions affect
the entire family.

416
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,894
I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry.

417
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,187
(Deon)
It's all right.

418
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,105
Don't worry about it.

419
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,356
Sean.

420
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,108
[rap music]

421
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,194
[cheering]

422
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,247
(coach)
Barnes!

423
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,463
I don't need you
getting into any kind
of dick waving contest

424
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,506
to see who can
lift the most weight.

425
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,468
You gotta keep your
legs alive for Oregon
on Friday night.

426
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,053
I'm focused
on the ball game, Coach.

427
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,138
I'm not gonna
mess it up.
I promise.

428
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,140
I believe you.

429
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,892
But I don't want you in
here after another hour.

430
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,561
One hour, you're done.
All right?

431
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,646
I mean it.

432
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,563
I'll be outta here.

433
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,941
One hour.

434
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,621
What the fuck
you doing in here

435
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,831
with the regular
population, homie?

436
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,792
Coach said
if he caught me
in the gym over an hour

437
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,503
he'd kill me,
so I came over here.

438
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,629
You wanna
lift weights?

439
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,256
Just a few minutes.

440
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,345
Yo, D. How much
you weighing there?

441
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,763
216.

442
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,515
Woo.

443
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,101
Let's get this money,
big homie.

444
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,521
Let's do this.
You gonna get far, baby.

445
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,106
This is lightweight
for me.

446
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,941
Let's make
it happen.

447
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,278
One for the mansion,
two for the Maybach,

448
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,030
three for the bitches,
four for the highlight.

449
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:27,285
Five for the fame.
I said five for the fame.

450
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,871
Man, you always got to go
all messed up.

451
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,375
Man, you ran it on me.

452
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,920
Boy, get mine.

453
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,636
Oh, God.

454
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,389
Hot hot damn.

455
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:53,144
[laughing]

456
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,733
What the fuck
you laughing at?

457
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,360
What you get
mad at me for?

458
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:05,990
Fuck this shit, man.
I'ma stay skinny.

459
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,327
That way my dick
look bigger.

460
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,370
The only Heisman trophy pose
I want to do

461
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,664
is when I grab
a bitch purse.

462
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,333
Get back, bitch!

463
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,419
I'm outta here.
You can have
that shit.

464
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,442
Hey.

465
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,944
Hey, you think
you can give
me a spot?

466
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,531
You want
me to spot you?

467
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,200
Why not?

468
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,952
Okay.

469
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,371
Here comes
the muscle.

470
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,102
Okay, you don't
need me so I'm
gonna go.

471
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,728
[groan]
Help, help.

472
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:18,813
Say please.

473
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,314
Help, please.

474
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:27,571
Please, baby,
help me.

475
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,739
See, I did
need you.

476
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,824
How was I?

477
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,492
Great.

478
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,993
It was
my first time.

479
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,745
Your first time?

480
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,830
Mm-hm.

481
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:48,175
Twelve.
Thirteen.

482
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,552
Fourteen.

483
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:53,806
Hey, yo, D.
What up?

484
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,017
You just can't be
busting up in here
like that.

485
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,978
Your brother downstairs.
You want me to send him up?

486
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,521
Tell him to
give me a minute.

487
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,441
Right. You want me
to tell him ten?

488
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,276
Tell him fifteen.

489
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,862
I was sitting
right over here.

490
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,113
I know, it's cool.

491
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,823
Alright.

492
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,491
Why'd you hit my head?

493
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,702
"Oh, give me fifteen."

494
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,037
- I was just playing.
- Forget about ten.

495
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,711
Explained this happened, man.
Set that up, dog.

496
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,546
It's going
down tonight.

497
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,964
(Deon)
It was crazy.

498
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,466
You okay?

499
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,800
No problems.

500
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,302
Give me a call
the next time

501
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,553
you need help
with your homework.

502
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,680
I'll do that.

503
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,806
Hey, what's up?

504
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,308
What's up?

505
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,018
Who's that?

506
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,312
It's my gyology tutor.

507
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,730
Geology.

508
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,815
Yeah, that.
Hey, how you doing?

509
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,983
Hey.

510
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,693
Sharon.

511
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,904
I remember. Tickets.
I promised her tickets.

512
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,280
Yo, June.

513
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,032
What you
need, cuz?

514
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,200
Those tickets
for my brother.

515
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,701
Man, I don't know.

516
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,453
What you mean
you don't know, man.

517
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,538
I hope you
ain't rolled 'em
and smoked 'em.

518
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,665
Come on, man.
Actually, you know
where they at?

519
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,877
They right over there
on the desk, right
next to the computer.

520
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,510
Where, I don't
see no--

521
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,345
Right next to
the computer.

522
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,598
I got it.
It was in
the drawer, man.

523
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,601
Here. These are for
you and my brother.

524
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,019
Thank you.

525
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,771
It's nice to
see you again.

526
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,856
You too.

527
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,358
Thanks for
coming over.

528
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,567
Alright. We'll
catch you later.

529
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,611
Alright.

530
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,202
I can't believe
he called her.

531
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,453
You can't.

532
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:43,207
Look at Sean.

533
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,876
(June)
Yo, you tell 'em
June's popping party
extravaganzas

534
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,128
is top notch.

535
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,048
If they want the deluxe tent,
it's gonna be 2,000 dollars.

536
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,760
It's set up time.
I'm not going in
that shit for free.

537
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,303
That's money
outta my pocket.

538
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,390
Where they do
that at? Damn, man!

539
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,059
All these bitches want me
to throw these big-ass
parties after the game

540
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,478
but don't nobody
want to pay for shit.

541
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,481
They trying to
stress me son!

542
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,109
Hey, don't be
hotboxing up
in my car, man.

543
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:14,488
There you go,
acting like
Officer Ricky.

544
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,657
[laughter]

545
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,617
Chill out,
chill out for real,

546
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,744
or you're gonna have us
in central booking.

547
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,384
(Eric)
Harry, Harry,
why you trying

548
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,594
to beat me up
on the price, man?

549
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,721
This here is a classic.

550
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,683
Oh, bullshit.
You know the blue book
price says 9,000 dollars.

551
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,935
How about if
I give you eight?

552
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,687
No, no, hey,
no, Harry,

553
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,606
I--I put it
out for 10,000.

554
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,190
I don't know if I can
take anything less
than that.

555
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,775
Eight's a good
price for it.

556
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,402
10,000.

557
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:56,655
You told me you'd
give it to me
for 12.

558
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,574
Who's this schmuck?

559
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,160
I spoke to my mom.
She said she'd
co-sign a note.

560
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,995
[laughing]
His mommy.

561
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,623
Come on, you got
two men talking
business here.

562
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,125
Huh? Kid.

563
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,710
Alright, look, look.

564
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,129
Uh, you just said
10,000 dollars, right?

565
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,881
Is that what you want?

566
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,924
You know how much
a car like this
is worth?

567
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,636
I ain't never seen
a '66 Stingray
in this kind of shape.

568
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,180
All you gotta do
is put some rims
on it, man,

569
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,057
and a system in it,
ooh, you know--

570
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,975
look, I'll give you
12-5 for it.

571
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,894
What is going on here?
What, are you gonna let

572
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:31,857
that Bob Marley here
outbid me on this car?
Come on.

573
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,567
(woman)
Harry, for
Heaven's sakes,

574
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,654
let the kid
have the car.

575
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:40,157
You're too old
for it anyway.

576
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,911
Wait a minute.

577
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,414
Look, you know this
has always been my
dream car.

578
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,835
Deon. What the
fuck you doing?

579
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,464
I just want my roses
when I can still
smell 'em.

580
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:02,930
I know, sweetie.
But it's only
a car.

581
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:07,768
No, not for me.
Look, let me
handle this.

582
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,689
Why don't you go
outside and enjoy
your minivan?

583
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,357
It's what
you like.

584
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,402
[sigh]

585
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,199
I need this
deal, man.

586
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:32,543
Alright. Look,
here's my final offer.

587
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,629
11,000 dollars.

588
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,799
I'll go get
my checkbook
right now.

589
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,760
[sigh]
Deal?

590
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:46,306
I'm sorry, kid.

591
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,058
Man, this
is bullshit.

592
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,227
Okay.

593
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,229
I'll be right back.

594
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,355
Excuse me.

595
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,987
11,000 dollars.

596
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,156
This--he's
a natural, man.

597
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,949
Man.

598
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,784
I had no idea you
were gonna do that, man.

599
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,328
You see that?
11,000 dollars.

600
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,122
But I don't get it.

601
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,248
Doesn't the old guy
know he won't get
a chance

602
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,083
to drive it long?

603
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,793
Oh, he knows.

604
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:20,215
Yeah. He just
wants to go out
on top.

605
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,927
Alright.

606
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,638
Tickets for you and
Mom, last game of
the season.

607
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,182
Oh, good looking out.

608
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,018
Ha, ha, ha.
Oh, that's my bro.

609
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,020
Listen, don't go
passing the glory.

610
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,521
I know, I know.

611
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,607
Yo, I'm gonna run
back to campus.

612
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,276
My ride better not
coming back smelling
like weed either.

613
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,862
Oh, it ain't. But it
might smell like
sex, dog.

614
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,823
He's stupid.

615
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,450
Hey, you joggin back?

616
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,118
Yeah.

617
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,661
Okay, six minute miles,
keep your pace even.

618
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,871
I know, I know.

619
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,206
Okay, alright.

620
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:56,502
Hey, hey.
11,000 dollars.

621
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,920
You the man.

622
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,797
From your mouth
to God's ears.

623
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,565
Oh, what's up, Sharon?

624
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,859
What are you doing
out here this late
by yourself?

625
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:24,029
Just closing
the bookstore
for the night.

626
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,572
How far you
live from here?

627
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,032
A couple of blocks
down the quad.

628
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,659
I'll walk with you.
C'mon.

629
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,994
So Sean finally
called you.

630
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,747
Yeah.

631
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,582
What'd he say?

632
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,376
Nothing, he just
offered to give
me the tickets

633
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,254
and brought me over
and that was it.

634
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,755
He didn't say
nothin' else?

635
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,260
No. What was
he supposed
to say?

636
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:51,265
I don't know.

637
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,434
I appreciate
you walking
me home.

638
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,978
It's nothing.
It's no problem.

639
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:07,030
Okay, I have to
ask you something.

640
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,617
Why'd you have your
brother call me
instead of you?

641
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,536
I don't know.

642
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,038
I mean, I
was busy.

643
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,457
And it, you know,
he--I wanted to
make sure you came

644
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:21,253
and he's good
with that kind
of stuff.

645
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:30,137
Okay. Well, if you wanna
go out, you should
just ask me.

646
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:34,099
Well, I'm asking
you now.

647
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,226
Okay.

648
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,728
Look at that
pretty smile.

649
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,244
I didn't wake
you up, did I?

650
00:31:54,287 --> 00:32:00,751
I'm good.

651
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:05,923
Got a seven o'clock
with Coach this morning.

652
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,300
Wanna come
check me out?

653
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,760
I'll be there.

654
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,309
Now you make me
not wanna go.

655
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:23,023
[kisses]

656
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,984
See you
later, alright?

657
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:29,529
(male announcer)
One minute, 39 seconds
left in the fourth quarter,

658
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,367
[sports announcer
speaking]

659
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,660
Defense, defense!

660
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,744
Defense!

661
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,788
[whistle blowing]

662
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,711
[players shouting
unintelligible]

663
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,551
Alright.

664
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,845
Ran the ball up the middle.

665
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,557
No gain on the play,
that's gonna force
the fourth down.

666
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,563
And the clock is ticking,
no time outs remaining.

667
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,565
It's gotta
be frustrating
for the Lakers.

668
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,818
Get past the gunner,
the gunner from
the left,

669
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,236
we'll have a wall
for you. Feel me?

670
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,654
Okay.
Got it.

671
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,655
Get it!

672
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:12,823

673
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,363
[crowd ohs]

674
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,489
The clock has stopped.

675
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,241
(coach)
Let's go!

676
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,160
Just 21 seconds
remaining in the game.

677
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,119
Enough for two plays.

678
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,038
Play, Deon.

679
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,372
Deon!

680
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,667
Come on, Deon,
go get them!

681
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:13,967
[players shouting]

682
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,302
Ready.

683
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,928

684
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,055

[whistle blowing]

687
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,076
(Deon)
Damn.

688
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,413
lncomplete pass to stop
the clock with 13
seconds remaining.

689
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,833
Seems we can get
the fucking Gatorade.

690
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,293
Bring it up!
Bring it up!

691
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,212
Bring it in, fellas,
here we go.

692
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,339
Let's go PA. Gator 92.
Let's buy protection up front.

693
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,757
(Deon)
This is it, fellas.
Last chance.

694
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,801
Yeah!

695
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,844
Home town, baby, this is
where you do what you do.

696
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,221

701

00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,131
[wild cheering]

706
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:40,846
[announcer unintelligible]

707
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:50,647
Yeah.
See that?
See that? That's it.

708
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,946
[players chanting]

709
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:08,039
[chanting continues]

710
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:12,002
We just won, but we
wouldn't have if you
hadn't caught them passes.

711
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,378
Don't touch me,
boy, alright?

712
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,005
You didn't even
wash up yet.

713
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,882
[chuckling]

714
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,550
Oh, shit.

715
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,760
Hey, D!

716
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,763
[shouting]

717
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,351
Deon!

718
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,187
[distant ambulance siren]

719
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:34,107
(Deon)
Is anyone there?

720
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,943
[echoing]
Can anyone hear me?

721
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,779
Is anyone there?

722
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,949
(doctor over mic]
Relax, Deon, you
have to stay still.

723
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,784
[clack]

724
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,287
[humming]

725
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,290
Can I get you
something, baby?

726
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,250
I'm okay.

727
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:57,881
What could they be doing?
We've been here all day.

728
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,382
[scoffing]

729
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,469
Sean, go find
somebody, please.

730
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,305
Momma, I already
checked. They're busy.

731
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,641
Look, just go out there
and bring somebody back

732
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,310
who knows
what the hell
is going on.

733
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,480
Please?

734
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,981
What'd I tell ya?

735
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,733
What?

736
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:19,903
I told you to get
your ass in that
endzone.

737
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,738
Guess what, Bernie?

738
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,949
SportsNet just bumped
your boy up.

739
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,909
That means we're
going to San Diego,

740
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:29,579
Denver or Miami.

741
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,164
[whooping]

742
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,083
We moving!

743
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,169
Look, we gotta
you outta here,
get you all fixed up.

744
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,671
Miami!

745
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,005
[whooping]

746
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,715
Oh, baby.

747
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,509
(Doctor)
I'm sorry
I took so long.

748
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,594
Oh, that's okay,
Doctor. What you
got for us?

749
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,014
We got the M Rl
results and what it's
showing is a growth,

750
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,101
a medio-spinal tumor
in your chest cavity.

751
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,979
And that 's putting
stress on your heart
and your lungs,

752
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,772
and that's
why you fainted.

753
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,315
What does
that mean?

754
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,609
[stammers]
But can he
still play?

755
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,362
He's playing in the
national championships.

756
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,824
At--at this time,
with the placement
of the tumor

757
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,785
any kind of physical
activity could cause
more damage.

758
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,328
Can we have
it removed?

759
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,622
Our preference would
be non-invasive.

760
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,374
Radiation
and chemotherapy

761
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,918
will shrink
the tumor.

762
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,629
What I think we have to do
is we gotta take a wait
and see approach.

763
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,299
We gotta
start chemotherapy
though immediately.

764
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,758
And then within
the next four months

765
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:28,888
we'll see
where we're at.

766
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:32,058
Okay? I'll
give you some time.

767
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,311
Excuse me for a second.

768
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:42,152
We'll work through this.
It'll be alright.

769
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,903
(Eric)
Hey, Doc.

770
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,906
Excuse me for
a minute, Doc,
Doc, hold it.

771
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,200
Do you know who
that is in there?

772
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,869
No, he--

773
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,329
That boy has a future.
He has a gift.

774
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,164
The N FL draft is
not until June.

775
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,332
Are you saying
we can expect a
full recovery

776
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,042
by April or May?

777
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,335
We'll know more
once we see how
his body

778
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,669
reacts to
the treatment.

779
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,087
Chemo and radiation?

780
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,547
Hold on,
that's six months.

781
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,549
You said it would
just take four.

782
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,551
It's always best to
remain optimistic,
don't you think?

783
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,720
Now look, Doc,
I know how the
game's played.

784
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:09,888
We're just a
little worried.

785
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,890
Eric, please don't--

786
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,558
We are. But all
this stuff is just
between the family.

787
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,977
I need to know it's
not leaving this room.

788
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:20,106
The hospital maintains the
strictest confidentiality.
He'll be okay, okay?

789
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,399
Thank you, Doctor.

790
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,942
Uh-huh.

791
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:33,536
Alright, we gotta
keep a lid on this
bullshit, okay?

792
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,747
So we're gonna
tell them you
got pneumonia.

793
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,791
No one has to know
the truth but us.

794
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,417
It does not
leave this room.

795
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,503
No, no, I don't agree
with that, I mean,

796
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,588
we might as well tell
them anyway because
they will find out.

797
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,049
Bernie, I can deal
with Coach Harper
and the university.

798
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,093
What about Miami?
What about the Dolphins?

799
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,595
It's not a
physical limitation.

800
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,472
Worst case scenario,
you're gonna be dropped down
to 9th or 10th or 11th pick.

801
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,224
But you'll still
be first rate.

802
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,142
You'll be okay.

803
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,477
Listen, I know the
championships are
in two weeks,

804
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,229
but you know what?

805
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,939
What those people saw
you do the other night,

806
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,273
they will
not forget you.
I promise you that.

807
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,650
I promise you that.

808
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,859
(Eric)
That's right.

809
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:21,084
(male professor)
1969, the
summer of love.

810
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,169
So I've been told.

811
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:27,674
America is
the first country
to land a man on the moon,

812
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,343
and at that same time,
we're number one
in education.

813
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,012
Now, we're
number 18.

814
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,849
And as more and
more jobs require

815
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,101
a college education,
fewer and fewer of us

816
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,853
are actually
graduating from college.

817
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,938
ln the year 2040,
ladies and gentlemen,

818
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:45,525
China will be the big player,
the big dog, America not.

819
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,527
So where are all
these new jobs
going to be

820
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,529
when you graduate
in the spring?

821
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,364
I would like you all to
come to Thursday's class

822
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,284
prepared to
discuss that. Okay?

823
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,536
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.
See you Thursday.

824
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,371
Be prepared.

825
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,165
Thank you.
Thank you.

826
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,169
Hey, stranger.

827
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,170
Hey, Sharon.

828
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,963
Hey.

829
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,799
Look, this is kinda
awkward but--

830
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,801
I've been trying
to call your brother
for the past couple of days

831
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,845
but I haven't
heard back from him.

832
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,139
Everybody's saying
he's got pneumonia.

833
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,307
Is he alright?

834
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,601
Yeah.

835
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,482
You don't like talking
about your brother
much, do you?

836
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,401
I think he can talk
better for himself.

837
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,820
Fair enough.

838
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,906
So, what's
up with you?

839
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,741
I'm on my way
to the crew lab,

840
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,242
working on my resume.

841
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,036
Oh, well,
show it to me.

842
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,496
Why?

843
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,498
'Cause I got
some resume skills.

844
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,666
No, for real.
I look at a lot.

845
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,876
Alright, look--

846
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,544
Let's see
what you got.

847
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:52,008
Don't clown 'cause
it's not finished yet.

848
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,928
What?

849
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,930
You interned
for a designer
in New York City?

850
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,349
Yeah. I've always
wanted to be in fashion,

851
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,434
so I took a chance
and went to New York.

852
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,854
Okay, well,
I'd move it
up on your resume.

853
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,525
Alright, you might know
a little something
about resumes.

854
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,527
Yeah, I think I do.

855
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,531
Can't you give me
pills or something
instead of that?

856
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,074
He needs
to relax.

857
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,159
I told you he
doesn't like needles.

858
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:29,087
Come on, Deon,
you gotta do
this now.

859
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,464
You remember when
you was six years old,

860
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,384
and we had
that big thunderstorm,

861
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,052
scared you so much
you hid under the bed

862
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,595
you thought it was
the wrath of God?

863
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,097
That was
a long time ago.

864
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,807
I know, baby,
I know, but listen.

865
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,393
Do you remember
what I told you then?

866
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,062
I told you there
was nothing to
be afraid of,

867
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,981
that it wasn't
God punishing you,

868
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,482
that he was trying to
give you something.

869
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,943
All that lightning
and thunder,

870
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,904
light so
bright you could
see inside your eye?

871
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,573
What'd I tell you?

872
00:42:56,615 --> 00:43:01,286
It was God giving
you superpowers.

873
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,870
I remember.

874
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:08,293
Yeah. So now,
I want you to
lay back.

875
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,920
Lay back.
Come on.

876
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,007
That's right.
Just relax.

877
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,176
Close your eyes.

878
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,179
And let God
bathe you in
His light.

879
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:23,349
Absorb the power.

880
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:27,812
Okay. Okay,
just lay down.
That's right.

881
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,689
Close your eyes now.

882
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:34,444
Take something scary
and turn it into
a strength.

883
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:39,365
And the next day,
oh, I can still
see your little face.

884
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:44,037
You marched out
onto that football field
with those super powers

885
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:48,124
like you could fly
over anybody and land
in the end zone.

886
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,959
Like you could run
like the wind

887
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,128
and never get caught.

888
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,464
And I was
just screaming.

889
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,883
Come on, D,
come on.

890
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:01,387
Use your super powers.
Use your super powers.

891
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:06,643
[angry shouting]

892
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,895
(Mom)
I am disappointed
in you!

893
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,522
[angry shouting]

894
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:17,320
[shouting continues]

895
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,825
You are not my son!

896
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,746
[shouting continues]

897
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,667
[equipment beeping]

898
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,766
Excuse me.

899
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,893
Excuse me,
I told you
on the phone,

900
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,020
we can't continue
like this.

901
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,022
We are following the
treatment plan that
you signed off on.

902
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,108
No, these costs
are out of control.

903
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:58,361
We are going to need
an updated credit card
on file for you.

904
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,696
For what?

905
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,197
Any ancillary
charges that--

906
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,075
Oh, ancillary charges
like...

907
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,120
129 dollars for
a mucus recovery system?

908
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,705
Fees like that
are often charged.

909
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:12,709
It's a damn
box of Kleenex.

910
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,711
Now I am not giving
you another credit card

911
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,421
and I'm not signing
any of your papers

912
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,214
until somebody
in this administration

913
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,383
explains to me why
I have to take out
a loan

914
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:26,764
to cover the costs
of buying Band-Aids
and gauze pads!

915
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,307
I'll provide my own.

916
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,395
I will provide
my own.

917
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:35,648
Excuse me, Doc, Doc,
do you know where
Dr. Brintall is?

918
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,233
I'm covering
for him but--

919
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,235
Oh, you cover
for me, listen, listen.

920
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,320
Deon Barnes. We brought
him in four months ago.

921
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,406
He's a football player.
We did the chemotherapy,

922
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,992
radiation, all that,
and it cost us a great
deal of money.

923
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,744
Oh, I don't get
into billing issues.

924
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,412
Wait, hold
on, then.

925
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,955
When we brought him in,
he was 214 pounds.

926
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,915
Now he little
and skinny.

927
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,751
We trying to get
this boy ready for
the N FL draft.

928
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,753
All he does
is sleep all day.

929
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,838
Well, in aggressive cases
like his that's
not uncommon.

930
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,257
It's a side effect
of his radiation.

931
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,009
What you need to do
is get him out of bed,

932
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,469
get him active
and see how he feels.

933
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,678
That's the best
thing right now.

934
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,804
Oh, but he--

935
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,938
(Mom)
Home sweet
home, baby doll.

936
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,398
Now you stay
right there.

937
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:21,277
I'll come around
and get you.

938
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,113
Okay. Okay,
take your time.

939
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,869
There we go.

940
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:34,290
Alright.

941
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,917
Here we go.

942
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,168
(kid)
Oh, look!
It's Deon.

943
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:40,046
[kids greeting]

944
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,048
They're so happy
to see you.

945
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,717
He's gonna play
with you later.

946
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,844
Okay?

947
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,764
Okay, come here.

948
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,851
[inaudible]

949
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:06,572
I'll get this.

950
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,740
There.

951
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,668
I'll take your
shoes off.

952
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:21,504
Okay.

953
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:25,675
Oh, I--
I talked to Sean.

954
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:31,931
He called.

955
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:36,853
Wait, I'll help you.

956
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,441
Alright.

957
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,778
I'll get you
in there.

958
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,239
Alright.

959
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,116
There you go.

960
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,285
You want some of that
ginger ale with
crushed ice

961
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,786
like you had
in the hospital?

962
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,454
Hm.

963
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,082
It's good for your
stomach, right?

964
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:01,127
I'll be right back.

965
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:27,445
(Mom)
The interviewer
made me so nervous.

966
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,572
How did
the interview go?

967
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,574
They had me meet
with the supervisor

968
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:34,660
and her direct
manager, and
I was there

969
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,746
for over
three hours.

970
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,664
Oh, well,
that's good.
Yeah! Real good.

971
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,249
Well, that
was a lot.

972
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,792
I think they
liked me.

973
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,669
What's not to like.

974
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,880
I mean, worst
case scenario,
you know.

975
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,673
If it doesn't work
out, there's a position
over at the dealership.

976
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,467
I mean, it's
not fashion, but--

977
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,594
Sean, it is so nice
to get a job for Sharon.

978
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,512
I would appreciate
that 'cause--

979
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,640
Hey, D, go ahead
and eat your food.

980
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,099
I'm almost half
done with mine.

981
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,102
Eric, if he's
not hungry--

982
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,272
you don't have
to eat, Deon, okay?

983
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,483
But I did make
some of that pecan pie.

984
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,692
You want some?

985
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,110
Pecan pie everybody?

986
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,820
I love pecan pie.

987
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,955
Bernie, you gotta
at least let him
get his own stuff.

988
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,456
I mean, he's been
home for two weeks.

989
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,874
He's just been
sitting on his ass.

990
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,542
Look, you have
to be patient.

991
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,211
It takes time.
I know Deon.

992
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,463
He's going to do things
in his own time.

993
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,674
He goes to take a dump,
you're there to help him.

994
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,092
Okay, that's disgusting,
that's enough.

995
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,677
I don't feel like
hearing that.

996
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,971
Look, the cancer
knocked him down.

997
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,681
We just have to
be patient.

998
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,224
It's not how many times
you get knocked down.

999
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,267
It's how many times
you get back up.

1000
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,269
Would you please stop
with that ra-ra football
bullshit?

1001
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,313
I know my boy,
I know he's gonna
be okay.

1002
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,816
He's not a boy.
And you can't teach
him how to be a man.

1003
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,901
The goddamn president
of the United States
was raised by a woman.

1004
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,569
Barack Obama
was raised
by single mothers.

1005
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,697
He don't play
football, do he?

1006
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,157
He play basketball.
Shut the--.

1007
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:58,452
Look, get the pecan pie.
I'll get the dishes.

1008
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,915
I have finals
and stuff

1009
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,917
so I think I'll
be heading out.

1010
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:05,876
I'll walk you out.

1011
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,504
I got it.

1012
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:14,677
[groan]

1013
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,430
Sorry about that.
That was embarrassing.

1014
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,557
No, no,
it's all good.

1015
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:22,518
They're all trying
to help you from
their own perspective.

1016
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,186
What about you?

1017
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,855
What about me?

1018
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:29,025
Things different now
that I got sick?

1019
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,944
No. It's been tough.

1020
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,404
It's just--

1021
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,614
You interested
in somebody else?

1022
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,700
Not at all.

1023
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,577
I've just got--
[cell phone rings]

1024
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:42,705
I'm sorry.

1025
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,792
It's my mother.

1026
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,419
I'll call you later.

1027
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,420
Okay.

1028
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:29,585
[groan]

1029
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,920
Two.

1030
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,089
(Mom)
Deon!

1031
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,424
Seventeen.

1032
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,884
Eighteen.

1033
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:40,012
[clapping]
That is great!

1034
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,806
[groan]

1035
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,683
You couldn't even
do that this time
last week.

1036
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,937
Look, I just came
to apologize.

1037
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,189
Eric acted
so damn crazy.

1038
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,776
You know, fussing
in front of--Sharon
and everything.

1039
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,614
Do you like her?

1040
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:02,034
[chuckle]

1041
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,536
Yeah.

1042
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:09,125
I see you
boxed up the TV.

1043
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:12,378
Well, we just
have to send some
of this stuff back,

1044
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:15,965
that's all. It's
just a delay.

1045
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,467
I know how much
you like that
flat screen.

1046
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:23,305
I do but it's just
a hiccup, that's all.

1047
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,850
Sweetheart, you gonna get
better in your own time

1048
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:29,186
and we gonna get rid
of this crappy ass
little house

1049
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,564
and we gonna be
down in Miami,

1050
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,649
livin' it, honey.

1051
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:39,572
And we gonna get
everything we deserve
in life, you'll see.

1052
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:44,243
I'm sorry, Ma.

1053
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,162
I didn't mean
to get sick.

1054
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,914
Oh, sweetie.
Don't apologize
for that.

1055
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,583
What you sayin'?

1056
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:54,003
I don't know why
this is happening.

1057
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:57,423
I mean, I didn't do nothing
to nobody, I didn't
do anything.
