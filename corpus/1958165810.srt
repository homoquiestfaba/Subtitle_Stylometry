1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,671
Are you ready, kids?

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,306
Aye, aye, Captain!

3
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:06,840
I can't hear you.

4
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:08,942
Aye, aye, Captain!

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,912
* Ohh... *

6
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:13,961
* Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea? *

7
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,983
SpongeBob SquarePants!

8
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,898
* Absorbent and yellow and porous is he *

9
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,787
SpongeBob SquarePants!

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,002
* If nautical nonsense
be something you wish *

11
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,057
SpongeBob SquarePants!

12
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,006
* Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish *

13
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,928
- SpongeBob SquarePants!
- Ready?

14
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:29,763
SpongeBob SquarePants!

15
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,099
SpongeBob SquarePants!

16
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,967
SpongeBob SquarePants!

17
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,336
SpongeBob

18
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:37,205
SquarePants!

19
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:42,210
* *

20
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:54,355
* *

21
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:57,425
You are traveling through
an aquatic dimension.

22
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:00,294
A dimension not only
of laughs and giggles,

23
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:04,365
but of uncontrollable nose milk.

24
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,567
When things start to get coocoo,

25
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:08,802
there's a pretty good chance you may have

26
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,041
just entered "The Tidal Zone!"

27
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,976
And we're back!

28
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,243
Yay!

29
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:19,380
Our next guest on "The Patrick Show"

30
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:25,586
are the wonderfully
talented Captain Quaaa...

31
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:28,489
Quaaa...

32
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:33,093
Ahh!

33
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,030
Captain Quasar and Pat-Tron!

34
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,305
Ahh!

35
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:49,710
Welcome to the show, fellas.

36
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,546
Cool spaceship.

37
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,648
Where are you guys from?

38
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,984
Um, outer space.

39
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,688
Out her face?

40
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:03,291
No.
Just outer space.

41
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,859
Well, better out than in!

42
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,466
Oh! Ooh!

43
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,769
Pat-Tron, I told you to
turn off your laugh track.

44
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:18,772
It always strips his gears.

45
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:19,973
Don't worry, folks.

46
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,277
I can fix it.

47
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:26,447
Ha-ha-ha-ha, Ha-ha-ha-ha.

48
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,984
I can't fix it!

49
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:32,386
Let me out!

50
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:36,390
Evacuating robo-bowels.

51
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:39,860
Ooh, I got something stuck to my melon.

52
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,362
That's my shrink ray.

53
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:43,997
I thought I lost that.

54
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,599
Ooh!

55
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,869
Ahh!
It's making my head all spicy!

56
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,137
Ahh!

57
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,619
Stop!
Give me back my shrink ray!

58
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,206
Ahh!

59
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,109
Hola, my little chatty show hosts.

60
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,511
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

61
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,580
Who wants to order a pizza?

62
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:01,148
Ahh... Ooh.

63
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:04,618
I'll take a large with
pineapple and potpourri.

64
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,720
Ohhh!

65
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,256
Here you go.

66
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:16,163
Um, fear not, studio audience.

67
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:22,770
I will unshrink them with the
growth ray I have in my ship.

68
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,008
Woo... hoo?

69
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,275
Wow.

70
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:33,013
Our house is gigantic now!

71
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,417
Oh, here's my gum!

72
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:38,919
And so cinematic.

73
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,988
It's cine-gigantic!

74
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,990
Is that even a word?

75
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,026
Ha, don't be retupulous,
Bunny, of course not.

76
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,696
Being small is gonna be fun-gigantic!

77
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:52,199
Last one to the big, stinky
sock is a rotten fish egg!

78
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,501
Hey, good one, Dad!

79
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,571
Shall we?

80
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:00,941
* Small, small, small,
small, small, small, small *

81
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:03,176
* *

82
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,478
Diminutive.

83
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,647
Yee-haw!

84
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,816
Whoo-hoo!

85
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,018
Tiny.

86
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,085
Puny.

87
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,087
Whoa!

88
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,288
Itty-bitty.

89
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,223
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

90
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,891
Teensy-weensy.

91
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,527
Small.

92
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,494
Ahh.

93
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,195
Lovely.

94
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,864
Ahh!

95
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,167
Not now, Tinkle!

96
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,841
I wish GrandPat were here to enjoy this.

97
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,143
Hee-hee! Ahh!

98
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,409
- Hello!
- Ahh!

99
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,983
Ooh!

100
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,185
Ha-ha-ha!

101
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,987
Oh!

102
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:51,191
Can't an old man play violent
video games in peace anymore?

103
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,225
Grr!

104
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,227
Water?

105
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,035
We got shrunk.

106
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,203
Hey, GrandPat!

107
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,973
Can you get us some tiny towels?

108
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,641
Vermin?

109
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,911
I'll get you with my bug spray breath!

110
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:19,186
GrandPat! No!

111
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,756
Hey!
Where'd they go?

112
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,795
You'll be safe in here, Stars.

113
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,397
Whew.
That was a close shave.

114
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:31,999
Thank you for saving us.

115
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,066
Yeah.

116
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,235
We apologize for GrandPat.

117
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,037
He thinks we're vermin.

118
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,006
Yeah.
Like you.

119
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,474
No worries.

120
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,877
We were just sitting down
to eat our roasted peppermint.

121
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:47,881
It's not much, but we're
willing to share it with you.

122
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,983
Share what?

123
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,019
Patrick!
Manners!

124
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,754
Minty.

125
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:54,822
I'll get it!

126
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,891
Ooh, I do hope it's more guests.

127
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:58,959
Boop.

128
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,027
Ooh!

129
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,061
Ahh!

130
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,195
I see you!

131
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:03,764
GrandPat?

132
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:07,100
To survive in the wild,
we find it best to stay

133
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,969
out of family squabbles.

134
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,303
Dartfishes, scatter!

135
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,438
Ahh!

136
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,974
- Ahh...
- Grr!

137
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,944
- Ooh, take that!
- Ahh!

138
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,480
GrandPat scared our new friends away.

139
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,716
This time he's gone too far.

140
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:26,153
Then I guess his beloved family is gonna

141
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,521
have to teach him a lesson.

142
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,923
That's us, right?

143
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,324
What?

144
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,829
Ooh, all this pest-huntin'
is making me hangry.

145
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,297
Let's see here.

146
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,769
Cake molds away!

147
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:47,307
Huh?

148
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,809
Why you...

149
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,912
Gah! Ahh! Achoo!

150
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,346
Ahh!

151
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,182
Why those little...

152
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,117
Ahh!

153
00:06:57,184 --> 00:07:00,253
Grr. Ahh!

154
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,723
Revenge of the vermin, eh?

155
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,725
Ahh.

156
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,360
Ohh!

157
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,797
You! Ahh!

158
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,398
Ohh! Ohh!

159
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,567
Oh! Oh! Ahh! Ahh!

160
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:16,970
Whoa-ho-ho! Ahh! Ahh! Augh!

161
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:22,242
Ohh, these insects
are smarter than my family.

162
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:25,545
That's it!
No more Mr. Nice Geezer!

163
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,514
Dentures, go get 'em!

164
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:32,586
Ahh!

165
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,990
Hi.

166
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,926
I am Rube-dor.

167
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,428
I shrunk you down with my futuristic

168
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,331
shrink suckers to save you from harm.

169
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,966
Thanks, Rube-dor.

170
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:50,203
And to introduce you to
the shimmering, shiny city

171
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,972
of Shmandor.

172
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,441
Ooh.

173
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,110
Shmandor is the place to be.

174
00:07:57,177 --> 00:08:01,181
Shmandor has fine dining,

175
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:02,449
spacious homes,

176
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,485
a state-of-the-art transit system,

177
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,755
shopping centers.

178
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,859
And conveniently located under the sea,

179
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:17,464
Shmandor is entirely made
of hand-blown glass.

180
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,500
Amazing.

181
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,469
Oh, boy, can we live here?

182
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,437
Sure, we can, kids.

183
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:29,076
Shmandor is so beautiful,
it makes me feel like...

184
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,811
* Singing *

185
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,111
Hold on!

186
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,483
There's no singing allowed in Shmandor!

187
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:38,952
And that's why!

188
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,387
Yuck.

189
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:43,223
Who wants to live in a
place where you can't sing?

190
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,894
* That was a close one *

191
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,163
* And here comes a closer one *

192
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,334
Ahh!

193
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:55,925
We're too small to be run over.

194
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,605
- Whew.
- Ha-ha.

195
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:02,810
Now, where would I hide
if I was a filthy flea?

196
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:08,849
I think it's time to
resume GrandPat's lesson.

197
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,619
I picked this one up inside Pat-tron.

198
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:16,356
Whoa! Guh! Ohh!

199
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:19,960
My scooter is haunted!

200
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:21,494
Ahh!

201
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,133
Ha!

202
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,201
Ahh!

203
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:31,604
Ohh! Ahh!

204
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,311
Aha!

205
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:43,951
Quit spookin' my wheels
or I'll roast you ghosts!

206
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,586
Ahh!

207
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,556
Egypt?
I love Egypt!

208
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,491
Ohh! Ahh!

209
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,593
Ugh!

210
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,263
But I hate mummies!

211
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,098
I gotta get home!

212
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,167
That was fun, but what if we're

213
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,303
too small for the audience to see us?

214
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,372
Hey, guys, look what I found.

215
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,941
Jumbo Grow plant food!

216
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:14,547
- Be careful!
- It's time to grow up!

217
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,550
Now I can see the fine print, Patrick.

218
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,554
It grows plants, but it shrinks people.

219
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,424
You shrunk us down to the sub-atomic

220
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,659
teensy-weensy level.

221
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:30,530
Ohh, now I'll never
finish tonight's show.

222
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,632
Stay together, Stars.

223
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,434
I think there's a way out of here!

224
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,806
Look, we're home.

225
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:41,274
Everything's back to normal.

226
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,342
Right?

227
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,676
Right!

228
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,579
Ahh! Except the Moon
is a big eyeball now.

229
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,550
Ahh!

230
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,853
Micro-critters are fascinatin'.

231
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,822
How can be they be so sophisticated

232
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:57,390
when they're so dang little?

233
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,692
Heh!
Glad no one's watchin' me.

234
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,202
Ahh!

235
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:15,809
Grandma Frenchy always said
"Don't sweat the small stuff."

236
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,879
And in this small world,
where good things

237
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:22,649
come in small packages,
it's no small wonder

238
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,118
that it's the little
things that mean a lot.

239
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:31,391
Especially in the wee small
hours of "The Tidal Zone."

240
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:35,095
Ahh!

241
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:49,709
* *

242
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,412
Imagine if you will,

243
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,882
the town of Bikini Bottom.

244
00:11:54,948 --> 00:12:00,120
Now imagine if everyone who
lived there was a robot.

245
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:03,790
Submitted for your approval,

246
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,493
a trip to Binary Bottom.

247
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,779
I'm re-re-ready.
I'm re-re-ready.

248
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,181
I'm re-re-ready.

249
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,417
I'm red-red-ready.

250
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,626
Morning, SpongeBot!

251
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,129
Ooh, you're looking handsome today!

252
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,130
Mwah!

253
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,631
Aww!

254
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,975
Ahh!

255
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,410
Meow.

256
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,980
Good... good... good morning, Robo-Gary.

257
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,453
Mroww!

258
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,856
Oh, you wanna play.

259
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,558
I know what you want.

260
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:18,398
Gary, be gentle with the little laser!

261
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,001
Ehh.

262
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,705
Oh!

263
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,876
Time for work, Gary.

264
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,112
I'll play with you more when I get home.

265
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,982
Aww.

266
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,083
Ah!
- Ooh!

267
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,850
Meow.

268
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,720
No, no, Gare-bearings.

269
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:43,290
You have to stay here at home.

270
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,393
Meow?

271
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,065
A little more to the left.

272
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,938
Almost there.

273
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,673
P-p-p-perfect!

274
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,010
See you later, G-G-G-Gary.

275
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,481
Finally,

276
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,851
someone whose company I actually enjoy...

277
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,186
Me!

278
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,990
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha.

279
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,558
Ha ha ha.

280
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,460
Time for work, Squidbot!

281
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,329
Time for work, Squidbot!

282
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,731
Time for work, Squidbot!
Time for work, Squidbot!

283
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,433
Power down

284
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,435
and leave me alone, SpongeBot!

285
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,437
I've still got 15 minutes!

286
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,572
Oh, sorry, Squidbot!

287
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,008
Sorry, Squidbot!
Sorry, Squidbot!

288
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,843
Go away!

289
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,280
I am going to have

290
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,115
to live next to that?

291
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,990
Knock, knock, knock.

292
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,693
Hey Pat-Tron, I'm going to work!

293
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,229
I'm going with you, SpongeBot!

294
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,564
I gotta fuel up.

295
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,799
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

296
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:08,108
Pat-Tron is currently in recharge mode.

297
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,043
OK, buddy.

298
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,479
I'll bring you some fuel
on my way back home.

299
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,351
If you're going to be
late, give me the key.

300
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,986
Ooh, sorry, Squidbot.

301
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:23,590
But... * The key bone's
connected to the finger bone *

302
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:33,980
You're fired!
You're fired!

303
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,535
You're fired!
You're fired!

304
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,841
You're fired!
You're fired!

305
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,374
Thank you, Bot-O.

306
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,543
I got stuck in the firing mode.

307
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,778
Ahh, to be fired.

308
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:50,350
Nobody's getting fired, you robo-loafer.

309
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,018
Everybody get to work!

310
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,486
Whoa!

311
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,056
Whoop!

312
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,759
The Krabby Batteries are sizzlin'!

313
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,461
Now it's time for condiments.

314
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,331
Hmm.

315
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,104
Food up, SpongeBot.

316
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,540
Gimme two batteries on
a barge and make 'em cry.

317
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,377
- Huh?
- Ahh!

318
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,047
Robo-Gary?

319
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,215
Squidbot?

320
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,650
No!

321
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,921
Gary-Squid?

322
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,457
Squid-Gary?

323
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,725
Does not compute.
Does not compute.

324
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,162
Get your filthy

325
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:38,131
robo-snail off my head!

326
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:43,035
Gary!

327
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,878
Ay-ya-ya-ya-whoa!

328
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,351
Ahh! Ahh!

329
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:05,792
I've gotta cut off this pooping parasite!

330
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,828
All right, what the kelp
is going on in here?

331
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,337
Come back here, you
nickel-plated nincompoops!

332
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:24,910
Plankbot, you forgot
to wind yourself again.

333
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:28,215
Thanks, Karen, my flesh and blood wife.

334
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,517
Don't worry, I'll get him.

335
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,918
Hi, Karen.

336
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,620
Did Gary come through here?

337
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,088
He went thataway, Chuckles.

338
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,057
Th-th-th-thank you!

339
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,760
Mama told me not to marry a robot.

340
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,463
Ahh!
Gangway!

341
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,097
Runaway robot!

342
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,402
Ahh!
- Excuse me, pardon me,

343
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:50,683
Excuse me, pardon me.
- Ow!

344
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,171
Excuse me, pardon me.

345
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,610
Ahh!

346
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:05,385
Who disturbs the sacred dome of Sandroid?

347
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:09,222
I'll hogtie your actuators!

348
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,757
Sandroid, wait!

349
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:14,026
Gary is too young to have
his actuators hogtied!

350
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,398
I'll hack your hard drives,
you cybernetic simpletons!

351
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,267
Ow!

352
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,404
All right, there you go.

353
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,688
Robo-dog!

354
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,823
Get your robo-dog!

355
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,468
Lube Lagoon?

356
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:57,804
What happened to Goo Lagoon?

357
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,507
Where in space and time am I?

358
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:03,610
Looks like I took a wrong
turn at the last apocalypse.

359
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,044
- Danger! Danger!
- Ah!

360
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,547
Rogue Robot!
- Gary, wait!

361
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,349
Come back!

362
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:13,520
Who dares defy Sandroid?

363
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:16,356
I'm gonna destroy all of you!

364
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,260
These junk heaps want my flab for fuel!

365
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,797
Ahh!

366
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,699
No, Gary!

367
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,401
Not the lagoon!

368
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,169
What do I do now?

369
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,436
Got to think.

370
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,446
That's it!
A brick wall!

371
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,683
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

372
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,159
Gary!

373
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,527
Stop!

374
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,200
Gary, stop!

375
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,467
Gary, stop!

376
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:03,836
Gary, stop!

377
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,705
He's not gonna stop.

378
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,374
Ahh!

379
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,142
Ahh!

380
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:15,314
Whoo-hoo!

381
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,853
Play nice with the flutterbot!

382
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,634
Ahh!

383
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:46,078
* *

384
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,345
Meow?

385
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,493
Amazing!

386
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,832
Flash photography is forbidden

387
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:09,702
in the presence of Sandroid!

388
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:13,406
You will all be assimilated!

389
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,609
So we can all be as close
as peas in a pod!

390
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,745
Yee-haw!

391
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,146
Oh man...

392
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:29,589
Well, this is another
fine metallic monstrosity

393
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:31,123
you've got me into.

394
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,859
Look at it this way, Squidbot.

395
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,474
Now we'll have a chance to catch up

396
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:36,095
with all our neighbors.

397
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,965
Hi, Rube.
- Well, hello!

398
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,433
Typical.

399
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,601
Typical.

400
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:42,602
Typical.

401
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,937
Ahh...

402
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:58,384
Rise of the robots!

403
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:01,454
Yee-haw!

404
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:04,290
I second that!

405
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,495
Robots can never replace us, you say?

406
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:12,031
Well, anything can happen in a cartoon,

407
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:15,902
especially if that cartoon
is from "The Tidal Zone."

408
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,637
"The Tidal Zone."

409
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,472
"The Tidal Zone."

410
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:20,507
"The Tidal Zone."

411
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:21,974
"The Tidal Zone."

412
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,785
* Lightning berries, lightning berries *

413
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,854
* I'm scanning for lightning berries *

414
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:37,557
* For dear, old,
Mr. Plankton *

415
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:39,859
* *

416
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,093
Bingo!

417
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:47,199
Huh?

418
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,670
Mmm.

419
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:54,907
Mm. Mm.

420
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:58,845
Huh?

421
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,915
Camper Patrick!

422
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:06,499
I can't believe you ate
all the lightning berries.

423
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,921
Huh? Who said that?

424
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,289
Oh, is that my hat?

425
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:12,659
No. Wait, just a sec... whoa.

426
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:15,862
Lightning berries

427
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:18,230
and Karen's computer circuitry.

428
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:19,832
A potent combination

429
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,902
which results in a shocking mind switch.

430
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:25,137
A common occurrence here in...

431
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:28,040
"The Tidal Zone."

432
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,146
Whee!

433
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:35,214
Whee!

434
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,183
Hmm?

435
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,319
And then Sandy said "yeah"
and Harvey goes "yeah."

436
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:43,255
And then Kevin said "yeah."

437
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:44,857
Everybody was saying yeah.

438
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,627
Enough!
Why are you talking to me?

439
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:50,563
I'm making memories.

440
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,832
- Well, remember this.
- Whoa!

441
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:56,235
Karen!

442
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,805
Ooh, there she is!

443
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,673
Where the heck have you been?

444
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,222
And where are those lightning
berries I asked you for?

445
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:04,543
I ate them.

446
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,178
What are you talking about?

447
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:08,147
You know you don't eat.

448
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:11,083
Now take me home.

449
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,619
Uh...

450
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,021
Oh, hey, buddy.

451
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,323
Come on. We're late.
- Whoa!

452
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:20,226
Ooh. Whoa, golly.

453
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,663
Oh, sweet ride.

454
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,397
You really know how to live.

455
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,641
Howdy, boys.
You're just in time.

456
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:37,109
I'm almost done setting up the game.

457
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,878
Whoa, whoa!

458
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,083
Whoa, what the heck?

459
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,519
My mind must've switched
with Patrick's mind

460
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,856
from the lightning berries.

461
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:52,524
Flesh and blood and guts.

462
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,494
I've gone analog.

463
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,398
Whoa!

464
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,668
So these are legs?

465
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,236
Whoa, whoa.

466
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:08,440
A living body isn't so hard to control.

467
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,309
- Huh?
- I think I got this.

468
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:16,348
All ready to play.

469
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:19,819
This here's the toughest
board game I ever invented.

470
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:22,521
In order to win, you need to know math,

471
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:25,057
science, literature, and history.

472
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:34,200
What's the square root of 25,553,025?

473
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:38,237
5,055.

474
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,872
- Huh?
- What?

475
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,809
Uh, the increase in speed of a liquid...

476
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,712
The law of fluid dynamics.

477
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,446
Post-structuralism.

478
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:49,515
395 AD.

479
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,517
The sinking of Atlantis.

480
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,320
I win!

481
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,256
Huh?

482
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:01,060
That's great, Karen.
Real great.

483
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:04,063
Now, I'll have to substitute
radioactive apples...

484
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,098
For the lightning berries.

485
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,735
Oof!

486
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:11,537
Huh? Is that me?

487
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,540
I'm a rollie shoe now?

488
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:15,908
Cool!

489
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:18,010
Leedle, leedle, leedle, leedle, leedle.

490
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,480
Leedle, le...

491
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,549
Ooh, ramp.

492
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,117
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

493
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:27,787
Oh, my Neptune!

494
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:29,956
Watch it!

495
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:37,096
Stop fooling around
and help me cut this open.

496
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:38,831
Hand me a scalpel.

497
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:41,400
Huh? Huh.

498
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,736
Let me...

499
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:45,437
I got it!

500
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:48,474
Now, hand it to me.

501
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,812
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

502
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:59,852
Careful!
That's full of sulfuric... acid.

503
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:05,758
All right, time for a robot reboot.

504
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:10,461
Get back here!

505
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:24,110
What's gotten into you, Patrick?

506
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,245
You don't seem like yourself today.

507
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,447
Well, I'm not myself.

508
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:33,152
I'm Karen, Plankton's computer
assistant in Patrick's body.

509
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:35,454
Our minds got switched

510
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:39,926
when we were both electrified
by lightning berries.

511
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:43,029
Hot diggity dog!
A mind switch!

512
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,698
Let's analyze.
What's it like?

513
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,235
Well, being in Patrick's body

514
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:53,873
has opened up senses
that I never had like taste.

515
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:57,910
Here, try a doughnut.

516
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:08,487
Ah!

517
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:11,357
That's delicious!

518
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,493
Hey, what's this taste like?

519
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:19,198
That tastes pretty good too.

520
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:22,068
Wow.

521
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:25,637
Are there more things to ingest out here?

522
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,020
What's happening to me?

523
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:43,189
That's called pain.

524
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,823
Ooh. Whoa.

525
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:49,395
Pain. Fascinating.

526
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,898
Ooh. Come on.

527
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:55,401
Kick me for more pain.

528
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,535
Hmm.

529
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:58,570
Ow, ow, ow.

530
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,976
Whoo-hoo!

531
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,278
Get back here!

532
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:08,948
Make way for the rollie shoe!

533
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:15,221
Nothing to see here!
Go back to your childhoods!

534
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,458
You okay in there, Karen?

535
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,796
Sense of smell, not so great.

536
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,566
Phew, well, it's been interesting,

537
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:28,834
but all in all,

538
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:31,670
I'll be happy to be back
in my old computer self.

539
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:34,006
Ooh, I rigged up this device

540
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:37,143
that I think will switch
you and Patrick's minds back.

541
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:39,912
I call it the crisscross contraption.

542
00:29:40,346 --> 00:29:43,849
That's my body!

543
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:46,652
We have to swap our minds back!

544
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:50,856
What are you talking about?
I'm a rollie shoe.

545
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:53,625
Rollie shoe forever!

546
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:57,429
Not a chance.

547
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,798
I'm rollie shoe!

548
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,868
Whoa!

549
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:07,974
Huh?

550
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,921
Whoa!

551
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,326
Hey, over there!

552
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:28,727
* *

553
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:32,631
Hmm.

554
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,066
Ooh!

555
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:35,901
Hmm?
- Whoa!

556
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,305
* *

557
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:40,571
Huh?

558
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:48,914
You can't catch the rollie shoe!

559
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:52,218
Okay, Patrick.

560
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:56,322
I was saving this for
my last meal with tastebuds,

561
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:57,889
but you win.

562
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,892
So here you go.

563
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,328
Ice cream!

564
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,336
I can't taste it!

565
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:13,805
I have no mouth and I must ice cream!

566
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,807
This is a nightmare!

567
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,914
I don't want to be a rollie shoe anymore!

568
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,181
Hmm.

569
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,587
Here goes nothing.

570
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,025
Whoa.

571
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:45,104
Karen, is that you?

572
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:47,139
Duh!

573
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:49,208
It didn't work!

574
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:52,211
You're still that pink pinhead.

575
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:54,880
Gotcha!

576
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,649
Why did I give you a sense of humor?

577
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,151
Whoa.
- Come on.

578
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:01,987
Let's go home.
- Whee!

579
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:04,890
All's well that ends well.
Right, Patrick?

580
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:08,960
Ice cream!
Gimme, gimme, gimme!

581
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,831
That's peculiar.

582
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:30,116
Leedle, leedle, leedle, lee.

583
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:33,719
Hey, I'm me again.

584
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,786
Guys?

585
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:38,257
Leedle, leedle, leedle, lee.

586
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:42,561
Leedle, leedle, leedle,
leedle, leedle, leedle.

587
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:47,966
Leedle, leedle, leedle,
leedle, leedle, leedle.

588
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,436
Hey, new Patricks!
Wait for me!

589
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:52,871
Leedle, leedle, leedle,
leedle, leedle, lee!

590
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,540
Ah, summer camp,

591
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:58,477
where each child is unique
in their own individual way.

592
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,447
Except for this one time

593
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:05,384
in Kamp Koral and this one place.

594
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:08,654
Hey, what is this?
"The Tidal Zone"?

595
00:33:16,262 --> 00:33:22,301
* *

596
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,572
Bonjour, art lovers.

597
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:29,908
Tonight, for your viewing enjoyment,

598
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:34,280
we present a portrait
painted in shades of greed.

599
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,350
Ahh!
Another day,

600
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,419
another whole bunch of dollars!

601
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,589
Hmm?

602
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:46,592
Ooh, a quarter!

603
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,795
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

604
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,397
Whew, come back here, you!

605
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:52,892
Hey, hey, where are you going?

606
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,503
Whew.

607
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,374
Eh?

608
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:04,910
Yah!

609
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:14,920
Huh?

610
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:19,225
Ooh, this quarter is
really making me work.

611
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:27,031
Huh?
Hey, get back here!

612
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,968
Ugh!

613
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:35,172
- Greetings, stranger.
- Ahh!

614
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:38,710
Welcome to my Emporium of Wonders.

615
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:40,679
Can I interest you in a traditional

616
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,549
Klopnodian Spladunker?

617
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:46,285
Or perhaps a lightly used Flooner?

618
00:34:46,352 --> 00:34:47,685
No thanks, old timer.

619
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,355
I just want me quarter.

620
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,089
It seems to have hopped
into your pay phone here.

621
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,692
Oh, I see.

622
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,027
Well I have no power
to retrieve your coin,

623
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,364
but I can let you have the payphone

624
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,433
for the low, low price of...

625
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,634
free.

626
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:04,470
Free?
I'll take it!

627
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:08,006
But be warned, that
payphone comes with a curse.

628
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:12,143
Really?
How much does the curse cost?

629
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,580
What?
No, the curse is free.

630
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:15,846
It comes with the phone.

631
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:17,215
Well then!

632
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:18,784
I'll take the curse, too!

633
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,487
Heed my Kapritzka!

634
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:24,456
Beware the call of the porch!

635
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:26,325
Beware!

636
00:35:26,392 --> 00:35:27,759
Ah, forget it.

637
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,699
Listen up, happy Krustomers!

638
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:36,535
For the low price of
a quarter, now you, too,

639
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:38,103
can make that important call

640
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,572
while you're eating a Krabby Patty!

641
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,076
Ahoy, there. Krusty Krab.

642
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,379
Eugene Krabs, proprietor, speaking.

643
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,483
Give away your Krabby Patties!

644
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,985
Give them all away!

645
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:57,356
What kind of obscene phone call is this?

646
00:35:57,423 --> 00:36:00,158
When I find out who you are, I'm gonna...

647
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:01,192
Oh!

648
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,794
Hey!

649
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:08,967
Must give patties away.

650
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:12,137
No money.

651
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,373
Patties free!

652
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,907
Free patties?

653
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,709
Oh, Mr. Krabs!

654
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:20,446
You finally found your inner generosity.

655
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,880
Hooray!

656
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:26,117
Krabby Patties for everyone!

657
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,786
Wha! Yow!

658
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:30,055
The Krab is picking up the tab!

659
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,526
All free.

660
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:47,172
Huh? What just happened?

661
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,009
Oh, boy! A quarter!

662
00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:52,678
I knew this thing would pay off!

663
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:53,945
Patties here!

664
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,146
Free patties!

665
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,882
Get your patties while they're hot!

666
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,717
Get 'em while they're free!

667
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:00,786
Free?

668
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:06,458
SpongeBob! There's no free
lunches at the Krusty Krab!

669
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:09,127
Have you gone insane?

670
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:10,862
Get back in the kitchen and stitch

671
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,498
these patty halves back together

672
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,232
so we can sell 'em again.

673
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:18,336
It was too good to last.

674
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,574
Krusty Krab, Eugene...

675
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:26,445
Now give away your money!

676
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:28,647
Every last cent!

677
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:31,249
Must give away money.

678
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:43,995
Give away all money, Boy-O!

679
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,131
But you just said that...

680
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:49,234
Oh, I knew you were
only kidding, Mr. Krabs!

681
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,704
You really are generous!

682
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:00,879
Another quarter!

683
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,748
I love this phone!

684
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:05,951
Whoo!

685
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:09,588
Whee!

686
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:11,089
SpongeBob!

687
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:13,525
What are you doing with me money?

688
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:15,661
Well, I thought you
told me to, Mr. Krabs.

689
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,763
I... oh, I don't understand.

690
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,200
- Uh! Ooh!
- And now, Krabs,

691
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:24,936
give away the Krusty Krab!

692
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:31,910
Yes!
With this laser cannon,

693
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:34,846
I can finally blast Krabs!

694
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:35,847
Huh?

695
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,282
Homina-wha?

696
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:40,351
Here his deed to Krusty Krab.

697
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,187
She's all yours.

698
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,157
Something doesn't seem right here.

699
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:48,860
But like Granny Plankton always says,

700
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:51,429
never look a gift snail under the shell!

701
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:53,765
I win!

702
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,934
I'm the greatest!

703
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,268
Huh?

704
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,535
Uh-oh.

705
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,479
Ooh!

706
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:09,314
Huh?

707
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,117
Ohh, what the... where's me quarter?

708
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:17,222
Perhaps generosity is its own reward?

709
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,857
Never!

710
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,293
Huh? Ooh.

711
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,561
Uh...

712
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,538
Huh?

713
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:38,476
Hey, what's the big idea?

714
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:40,912
And where is that quarter you owe...

715
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:43,715
I'm free!
Ha-ha!

716
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,483
Um...

717
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:48,153
Hey kid, lend me a quarter for the bus?

718
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,822
Sure thing, Mr. Demon!

719
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,924
I'm finally free!

720
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,264
Well, this ain't so bad.

721
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,133
Steady work, and plenty of quarters!

722
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,870
A crab could get used to this!

723
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:06,171
Whoa!

724
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,807
Hey! What's going on?

725
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,281
Hey, Squidward,

726
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,029
get that hunk of junk
out of here, would you?

727
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:18,984
Come on.

728
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,251
Gladly.

729
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:27,292
Hello, anyone wanna make a call?

730
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,494
Only costs a quarter.

731
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:30,929
Ooh, barnacles!

732
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:34,800
Sometimes a free phone

733
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,235
comes at a very high price,

734
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:39,537
and sometimes the cheapskates

735
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:41,907
are the ones who get stuck with the bill

736
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,942
here in "The Tidal Zone."

737
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:48,045
Hello?

738
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:56,321
Must give away one more story.

739
00:40:56,387 --> 00:41:00,592
The story of a grandpa
adrift in space and time.

740
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:05,230
The story of a sea star who
is lost in "The Tidal Zone."

741
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:16,074
Outta my way, you psychedelic space junk!

742
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:18,576
Sweet Neptune!

743
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:22,213
Have I found the
beginning of the universe?

744
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,915
* Ohh... *

745
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,550
Ooh!

746
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:33,271
* Who lives a
pineapple under the sea? *

747
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,960
Grandpat Sea Star!

748
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,395
* Absorbent and yellow and porous is he *

749
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:39,497
Grandpat Sea Star!

750
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:41,346
* If nautical nonsense
be something you wish *

751
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:43,501
Grandpat Sea Star!

752
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:45,583
* Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish *

753
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,372
- Grandpat Sea Star!
- Ready?

754
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:51,309
Grandpat Sea Star!
Grandpat Sea Star!

755
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:53,544
Grandpat Sea Star!

756
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:54,980
Grandpat

757
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,716
Sea Star!
- Oh! Ow!

758
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:02,721
Ow!

759
00:42:02,788 --> 00:42:04,990
I gotta get out of this nightmare!

760
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:06,324
Ohh!

761
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,668
* *

762
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:18,936
* *

763
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:26,712
This town ain't big enough
for the both of us.

764
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:35,353
- Whoa!
- Ahh!

765
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:40,357
Ohh!

766
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:49,200
Um... this town ain't big
enough for the both of us.

767
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:04,382
Now that's a good looking baby!

768
00:43:09,054 --> 00:43:11,056
Well, this is my stop.

769
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:13,058
See y'all later!

770
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:14,993
Hyep!
Giddy-up, now!

771
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,930
Yahoo!

772
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:20,531
Happy trails!

773
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,868
Ahh!

774
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,801
Ohh!

775
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,407
Uh! Yah!

776
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:36,846
Bonjour.

777
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:41,019
It's good to be back home
where it's normal.

778
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,387
- Hi, Grandpat...
- Huh?

779
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,189
What you watching?

780
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:48,827
Ehh, close enough.

781
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:53,198
And so we leave things
a little bit weird,

782
00:43:53,264 --> 00:43:57,235
but that's how we like it
here in "The Tidal Zone."

783
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:58,636
Au revoir.

784
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:01,272
Hey, I was watching that!
