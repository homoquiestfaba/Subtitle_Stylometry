1
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:23,644
I can't believe it. I'm married
six years and I'm still happy.

2
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,313
You're lucky. I think
Louise is cheating on me.

3
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,317
We're not cheating.
We're just good friends.

4
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,029
- Look, he's worried.
- He's joking!

5
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,948
Wait a minute.
Pull the cab over.

6
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,242
- This ain't the address.
- Be quiet!

7
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,036
D[Singing]

8
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:45,207
Sammy! Tony!
Who's that singing?

9
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:49,545
D[Singing]

10
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,673
- Sounds like Vicki.
- That is Vicki.

11
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,509
We'll get off here, cabbie.
George, pay the man.

12
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,053
- What!
- $1.80.

13
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,556
$ 1.80?
Your meter broken?

14
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,725
Fellas.

15
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,230
- It's her.
- Would you look at that?

16
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,898
It's her.

17
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,362
DHere in your arms
I'm wealthy tonight

18
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:20,409
d When youth has its fling d

19
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:27,749
d Love is the thing d

20
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:33,422
d While lovers fight for power d

21
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,466
d We can...

22
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:41,471
d Walk among the flowers d

23
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:45,976
They were the unhappiest
couple I ever knew.

24
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,478
And the happiest.

25
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,523
I thought the third time
they would have made it.

26
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:56,778
D Love for you and me d

27
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,990
[Phil] Vicki and Charley.
Now there's a story.

28
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,493
I never told you this?
I'm sure I told you.

29
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,705
I'm gonna tell you the story,
and you're gonna think I'm making it up.

30
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,666
But I swear this is
exactly how it happened.

31
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,921
It all started on a warm
June night, 1948.

32
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:18,133
My friend, Charley Pearl, had
just announced his engagement...

33
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:21,011
to the daughter of the most
important producer in Hollywood.

34
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,680
Now, for a struggling
comic like myself...

35
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,059
this was a rare chance to get into
a big-time Hollywood mansion...

36
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,811
for which I otherwise
would've had no chance at all.

37
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,857
For Charley it was the beginning
of the biggest roller coaster ride...

38
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,360
in the history
of modern romance.

39
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,279
Dd [Swing Music]

40
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,536
Adele Horner was
a new type dame for Charley.

41
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,830
She had class, education.
Nice girl.

42
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:52,125
You're the only woman
in the world for me, Adele.

43
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,461
In the whole world?

44
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:58,382
In as many
worlds as they got.

45
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:02,052
But me and the guys couldn't get
over Charley getting married.

46
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,346
Here he is,
a good-looking guy...

47
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,890
with millions coming in from
the family toothpaste business.

48
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,518
To small-time
bachelors like us...

49
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,564
Charley Pearl was a god.

50
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,233
Five feet from
where we're sitting...

51
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,652
there are three directors
I would sell my mother to meet.

52
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,572
- You sold your mother last year.
- They returned her.

53
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,994
Don't ever be funnier
than me, sweetheart.

54
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,914
He's not in love with her.
I'll tell you that.

55
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,958
How do you know?

56
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,586
Well, he might love her.
But he's not hot for her.

57
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,130
So the hors d'oeuvres are hot.
Isn't that enough?

58
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,591
Why's he marrying her?
It's not as ifhe needs money.

59
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,676
She doesn't need his,
so I trust her.

60
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,887
For Charley that's
a hard thing to find.

61
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,580
Charley, let's not get
married unless it's forever.

62
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,707
I'm spoiled rotten.

63
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,168
And I wouldn't know how
to handle disappointment.

64
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,629
Every woman
I have ever been with...

65
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,798
has made her living
from disappointments.

66
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:25,552
I need somebody good and
solid to keep me in check.

67
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:28,555
I'll hold you to that,
Charley.

68
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,684
I'll never let you out
of my sight.

69
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,646
Bite my mouth.

70
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,649
Go on.
Bite it hard.

71
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,238
No, Charley.
I don't want to hurt you.

72
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:48,534
You don't get it, Adele.
I like it when it hurts.

73
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,706
Ahem.

74
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,167
I'm sorry to intrude.
But your father...

75
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,336
would like a few moments
with Mr. Pearl.

76
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,172
Don't look so worried.
He already said yes.

77
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,508
He's been known
to change his mind.

78
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,594
It's too late.
I already made up mine.

79
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,322
Sit down, Charley.

80
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,366
Thank you, sir.

81
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,373
- Cigar?
- No, thank you.

82
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,293
- Brandy?
- Not for me.

83
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,504
Is it true you don't
smoke or drink?

84
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,549
Stains the teeth.
That's what my father taught me.

85
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:51,096
Makes you look impressive.
That's what my father taught me.

86
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,185
No vices at all,
Charley?

87
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,605
Oh sure. All the ones
that don't stain the teeth.

88
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:03,317
Well, you got
nice teeth.

89
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,490
How would you
characterize yourself?

90
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,659
As a playboy?

91
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:16,079
I prefer the word
"sportsman."

92
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,749
You don't give a damn
about impressing me...

93
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:22,920
- do you, Charley?
- I'm trying like hell to make
a good impression on you.

94
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,088
But you know
everything about me.

95
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,257
I spotted those two
private detectives...

96
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,343
you've had tailing me
for the last month.

97
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,929
Sure I play the horses,
bet on football, baseball...

98
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,931
anything that
moves or rolls.

99
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,433
I've been out with every starlet
from Paramount to Warner Brothers...

100
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,936
and I've had
a dandy time doing it.

101
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,022
But, that was
before I met Adele.

102
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:46,360
Is it having 30 million dollars
that makes you so cocky?

103
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:50,906
No, I don't think I'm cocky.
A little stupid, sometimes.

104
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:55,452
No, I don't think
you are.

105
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:59,581
Fact is, I don't know
what the hell you are.

106
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,917
Why did you
pick Adele?

107
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,587
There's a thousand better
looking women you could have
by just snapping your finger.

108
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:11,134
I don't think you appreciate
your own daughter's qualities.

109
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,887
She's got style.
She's got class.

110
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,598
Adele is a thoroughbred.
That's something I know about.

111
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:19,142
We're not trading
horses here, Charley.

112
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:23,146
We're talking about my one
and only daughter, Adele.

113
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,774
Now what is it you really want?
To produce movies?

114
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,734
Produce movies?

115
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,112
No, I'd miss too
many ball games.

116
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:37,286
We've talked about
everything except hard work.

117
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:40,289
Exactly how much schooling
have you had?

118
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,458
I went to a few Harvard
and Yale football games.

119
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,128
Look, let's face it.

120
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,506
I'm not ambitious.
I don't have to be.

121
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,093
You know, my mother walked
out on us when I was three.

122
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:55,512
Never saw her again.

123
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,098
So my old man
gave me everything...

124
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:01,643
except the mother
I didn't have.

125
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,980
I love that old guy.
I'm gonna pay him back...

126
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:08,150
by settling down.
My father made me rich.

127
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,444
Now I want
to make him happy.

128
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,783
You're good,
Charley.

129
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,828
You use charm...

130
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,372
like a dealer uses
a fresh deck.

131
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,295
There isn't an
ambitious writer...

132
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,673
actor or director
out there...

133
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,635
who wouldn't sell
his soul to marry Adele.

134
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,970
But you present
a problem to me...

135
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,973
because you're lazy
and you're independent.

136
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,309
How am I going to
control you, Charley?

137
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,394
You can't.

138
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:48,357
But Adele, she can
make me do handstands.

139
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,655
There are two things in this
world that matter to me.

140
00:10:56,406 --> 00:11:00,035
My daughter
and my studio.

141
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,579
You hurt my studio
and I kill you.

142
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:06,083
You hurt my daughter...

143
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,335
and you'll pray
for me to kill you.

144
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:16,885
Don't give it a thought, sir.
I'm not a praying man.

145
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,015
[Phil] Okay, two days later
we were headed for what was then...

146
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,768
just a little dusty town
called Las Vegas.

147
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,104
We were throwing Charley
a bachelor party.

148
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,274
A three-day orgy at the
Pick-A-Daisy Ranch...

149
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,442
where all the Daisys
wore D-cups.

150
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:35,112
"She loves me, she loves me not"
was the house game.

151
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,239
By the time Charley
went on his honeymoon...

152
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,533
we'd have Adele carrying
him across the threshold.

153
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,703
Did I tell you clowns Esther
Williams likes one of my songs?

154
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,705
Hey, that's terrific!

155
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:49,042
- MGM wants her to sing it
in her next picture.
- Where, underwater?

156
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,253
Shut up, you.
What song?

157
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:55,257
D Haven't we met before
Haven't we met before dd

158
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:59,428
Wait a minute. That's my song.
You promised that to me.

159
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,305
So now I promised MGM.

160
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,307
Since when does friendship
come before career?

161
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,102
You little shit. In two years
I'll be MGM's hottest star.

162
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:10,731
Esther Williams will do a
backstroke in my bathtub to
get me in one ofher pictures.

163
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,817
And you will kiss my ass
before I do one of your songs.

164
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,612
I'll kiss it now.
I'm not proud. Bend over.

165
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,114
You can't do no Esther Williams
picture. You can't swim.

166
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:22,409
- How do you know?
- You never go near the water
because you wear the toupee.

167
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,620
I wear a toupee,
you fuckhead?

168
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,955
You know,
I love this guy.

169
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,125
- He manages the worst
baseball team in the minors.
- I'm sorry?

170
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,503
Finishes last
three years in a row.

171
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,505
- Four!
- Four years in a row!

172
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,590
Now he knows everything
about show business.

173
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,967
I know umpires making
20 bucks a month...

174
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,929
- better rugs on their heads.
- Mr. Pineapple Head.

175
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,306
- Pineapple head?
- Can I say something, George?

176
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,308
You're very boring.

177
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,810
You want to hang out with us,
get snappier dialogue.

178
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,021
I don't hear Charley coming
up with any snappier dialogue.

179
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,607
- That's different. Charley's rich.
- Hey, hey!

180
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,985
I don't mind if Charley bores us.
Is this fun?

181
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:00,113
Is this the best time
you ever had in your life?

182
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:03,700
Going to Vegas with three-and-a-half
funny guys who treat you like an equal.

183
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,827
We pretend that we
enjoy your company.

184
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,871
Why do we treat you...

185
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,957
like an equal?

186
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,168
- Because I pay for everything.
- Exactly.!

187
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,838
[Tire Pops]

188
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,340
You see. The first thing
he grabs is his hair.

189
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,509
I always do this.

190
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,345
Hey, buddy.

191
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:28,016
- How long's it going to take?
- You want it fast or
do you want it to last?

192
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,312
I'll write the lyrics.
Just fix the tire.

193
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:35,816
Adele, we have a bad connection.
I miss you too, honey.

194
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,820
I still say
he's not hot for her.

195
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:44,324
About 40 miles outside of Vegas.
I'm going to drop these guys
off and head back tonight.

196
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:48,036
I just miss you
too much.

197
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,206
What did he say? Birds were chirping.
I couldn't hear that.

198
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,919
I love you.
Bye, honey.

199
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:59,006
He's joking, that's what it is.
He's joking. Charley.

200
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,593
Don't tell jokes. You're not funny.
We're funny, not you.

201
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,179
It's no joke.
I'm going back.

202
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,680
Aw, Charley!

203
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,266
I'll take you there.
I'll pay for the weekend.

204
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,935
- I'm going back to L.A. Tonight.
- Charley.

205
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:16,106
- I miss her, guys.
- Tell him what he's missing.

206
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,776
On my mother's life,
these are not women, they're goddesses.

207
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,404
- Am I lying, Sammy?
- Goddesses, Charley.

208
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:25,782
Any of them could marry a prince
or a duke if they could get to Europe.

209
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:29,244
Big women, six-two, six-three.
There were 12 of them.

210
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,788
It's like
a mountain of tits.

211
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,791
Hey, the tire,
the tire!

212
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,794
You guys don't get it.
I'm getting married in six days.

213
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,924
I'm tired of screwing around. That's
all I've been doing my whole life.

214
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,968
Can I ask you a question?
Are you hot for Adele?

215
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,971
I just got finished telling you,
I'm nuts for her.

216
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:51,391
We're not talking about nuts.
Nuts is a different topic.

217
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,769
We are now
talking about hot.

218
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:57,481
- Hot!
- Different than nuts.

219
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,650
I've had hot before.

220
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,944
Hot always
got me into trouble.

221
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:05,489
Hot always cost me a bundle
of dough and a kick in the ass.

222
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:08,825
- I want a woman I can depend on.
- Why can't you have both?

223
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:13,247
Because you can't.
You ever hear of crimes of passion?

224
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,582
A hot woman
screws up your mind.

225
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,793
Guy sees the woman
he's in love with...

226
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,337
in bed with another guy,
he writes her off.

227
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:23,799
- He catches some guy screwing
the woman he's hot for...
- [Crash]

228
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,426
She's done!

229
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,976
[Phil] We did talk Charley
into stopping for a few drinks...

230
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:38,146
figuring we could persuade him
tojoin us at the Pick-A-Daisy.

231
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,149
You can lead
a man in love to water...

232
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:45,320
but you gotta drag him
to horse around.

233
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:48,282
Dd [Swing Music]

234
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:51,326
Feeling lucky.!
Feeling lucky.!

235
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,214
Watch your hands.!
Keep your hands back.!

236
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:19,188
He's on the phone again.

237
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,732
We should have killed
this romance when it started.

238
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,318
A man in love is a man
who dumps his friends.

239
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,320
I'm going
to miss Charley.

240
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,160
Fellas, I have found
the one girl in a million.

241
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,871
You ask me if I'm hot for her,
I'm better than hot.

242
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:40,042
I am crazy, nuts,
absolutely insane for her.

243
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:44,004
That's great. Maybe one day
you'll be hot for her, too.

244
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:49,218
And now here's a young lady
I know you're going to enjoy.

245
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,553
Dd [Blues]

246
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,722
Adele wants to put
my picture on the ceiling...

247
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,767
so it's the first thing
she sees in the morning.

248
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,187
I wish we didn't have
to wait six day...

249
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:13,450
d Birds do it d

250
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:16,119
d Bees do it d

251
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:20,624

d Let's fall in love d

254
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:31,760
Sometimes it's
good to wait.

255
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:38,976
- Who is that?
- For example.

256
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,980
D Let's do it
Let's do it d

257
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:46,066
Who is she,
Sammy?

258
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,777
Must be a new kid.
Never saw her before.

259
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:56,326
D The Dutch in
old Amsterdam do it d

260
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,914
d Not to mention the Finns d

261
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:06,503
d Folks in Siam do it d

262

d Think of Siamese twins d

264
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:16,430
Nice body.
Right, Charley?

265
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,515
She's um...

266
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,642
She's got, um...

267
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,686
Good phrasing.

268
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:26,356
- Her phrasing, it's good.
- First thing I noticed
when she came out.

269
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,859
Let's hear her phrase
a little more.

270
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,777
One more song?

271
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:35,365
One song, one encore,
one reprise. That's it.

272
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:40,370
D Electric eels

[M.C.] Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Vicki Anderson.

294
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,794
I gotta
get going.

295
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:12,796
Charley,
where's your manners?

296
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,466
Tell the lady how much
you appreciate her phrasing.

297
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,762
D Murder, he says d

298
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:24,725
Sammy, ask if the lady will join
some admirers for a drink.

299
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,978
- Phil...
- She'd get a kick out of meeting you.

300
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,814
- Okay, Sam?
- Can do.

301
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:34,610
If the man says
"can do," can do!

302
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:37,654
D Is that the
language of love d

303
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,992

dls that

307
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:59,009
No good. Bad idea.
No can do.

308
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:02,304
What do you mean?
She won't have a drink with us?

309
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:05,933
- She's seeing a guy. She's spoke for.
- Let me talk to her.

310
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,976
- Leave it to me.
- Forget it!

311
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:15,609
She's Bugsy Siegel's girl.

312
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:23,033
- That name was not mentioned.
- Let's go.

313
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,160
What's wrong with asking her
to have one drink?

314
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:28,205
Nothin'. So they'll bury
us all in the same box.

315
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,041
Pay the check.
Leave a very big tip.

316
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:35,879
- I just want to say hello.
- Without a tongue?

317
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,632
They don't call Bugsy "Bugsy"
'cause he's friendly.

318
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,468
- Grab his arms.
- Come on.

319
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:44,221
Don't look back.
They got cameras in the ceiling.

320
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,306
You don't think that girl
has something special?

321
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,643
You're just nervous. Suddenly,
any gorgeous girl looks good.

322
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:52,813
You don't think
that girl is beautiful?

323
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,732
I thought she was
a little common.

324
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:58,694
Adele is pretty.
This girl...

325
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:05,158
d... Will bring on
nobody's murder but his own d

326
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:07,327
Hard to say.

327
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,538
Charley, you gotta
come with us.

328
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,040
- We need you for the group discount.
- Get in the car.

329
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,251
It's too late to
make it back to L.A.

330
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,670
Give the girls
at the ranch a break.

331
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:19,089
- I want to get back to Adele.
- Charley!

332
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:21,425
- Bust a couple of broncos for me.
- See ya at the altar.

333
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,427
Can you spot me
a twenty?

334
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,430
You're a lucky man to have
a real lady waiting for you.

335
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,182
Poor slobs like us...

336
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:31,059
we've got to kill three days
humping 12 crazy amazons!

337
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:33,103
See ya later, Charley.

338
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:36,440
- It's only a dime to change your mind.
- Knock 'em dead.

339
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:40,235
- We miss you already. Come on.
- We'll mail you the bill.

340
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:44,072
DHe said get in the groove

341
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:47,618
dHe said keep on the move

342
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,579
- d He says murder d
- Murder!

343
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:52,539
- Murder!
- Murder!

344
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:59,463
D Murder, murder, murder
that's what he said d

345
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:08,222
[Applause]

346
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:21,318
Is that clock right?
1:30?

347
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,946
Guess so.

348
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,115
You're the first one in Vegas
who ever asked me the time.

349
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:29,409
Another
two-cents-plain?

350
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:32,120
Sure.
Why not?

351
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,505
How ya doin',
Charley?

352
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:50,806
Well, I'm doin'
just fine, thanks.

353
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,977
Lady's talkin'
to me, chief.

354
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,813
Oh, oh!

355
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:01,149
My name is Charley, too.

356
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,487
Honest.

357
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,825
I saw your show.

358
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:12,286
All three shows,
as a matter of fact.

359
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:16,206
- You're very good.
- The lady likes to drink alone.

360
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,210
Why don't you show her
a little professional courtesy, Charley?

361
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:24,840
I'm not trying to pick you up.
I'm getting married in six days.

362
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:28,177
I couldn't be happier for you.
Do we have any peanuts?

363
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:30,137
Yeah.

364
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:35,225
- Thanks.
- Yes, sir...

365
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:37,561
finally gonna
tie the old knot.

366
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,813
Never thought it
would happen to me.

367
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:41,815
I'm up here on
a bachelor party.

368
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,736
Quiet party.

369
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:49,656
I left early. Me and the guys,
we really went wild.

370
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,534
I was going to drive back
to L.A., but I decided...

371
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:55,871
to stay and see
your last show.

372
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:59,208
Is there an album of yours
that I could buy?

373
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:03,879
Because if there isn't, then
somebody better open their eyes...

374
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:06,924
because I think you have
one hell of a future.

375
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:10,219
- You in show business?
- No, toothpaste.

376
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:13,889
No wonder you
smile so much.

377
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:16,683
My name's Pearl...
Charley Pearl.

378
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,769
Gus, got a
talker down here.

379
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:21,104
I'm in the columns
now and then.

380
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:24,274
Really?
Selling toothpaste?

381
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:27,569
I race cars, speedboats...

382
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:29,613
play a little polo.

383
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:32,366
You like polo?

384
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:35,035
I would have thought a guy
getting married in six days...

385
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:37,037
would behave himself.

386
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,040
- Am I out of line?
- Your foot's on the edge, pal.

387
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:43,919
Excuse me.
This section just closed.

388
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:47,881
Move to the other end of the bar,
we'd be glad to pick up your tab.

389
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:52,219
- Have I offended someone?
- I don't own this hotel.

390
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:55,055
See, no one's
complaining.

391
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:58,267
Look, I asked you nice once.
Second time gets ugly.

392
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,310
He's harmless, Gus.

393
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:02,312
He's getting married
in six days.

394
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:05,315
I just want to make sure
the guy shows up.

395
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:08,151
You got two minutes
to finish your drink.

396
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:10,612
Then you run
out of'em.

397
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:19,496
Those guys must think
you're pretty important.

398
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,749
- My fan club.
- Listen...

399
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:26,295
I know some influential
people in your business.

400
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:28,630
Is there any way
they could sort of...

401
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:31,675
- get in contact with you?
- Nope.

402
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:33,844
Don't go yet.

403
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:35,762
Don't touch, Charley.

404
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:38,348
Those guys know how
to turn wives into widows.

405
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,851
I mean it when
I say you're good.

406
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:43,478
You should be making records,
playing big clubs.

407
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,814
You should be
in the movies.

408
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:49,651
Charley, I'm gonna save your life.

409
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:51,695
Do you know who I am?

410
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:54,031
Yeah, Bugsy Siegel's
girlfriend.

411
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:57,492
If they hear you call him Bugsy,
they'll turn you...

412
00:26:57,576 --> 00:26:59,828
into a roulette wheel.

413
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,122
I'm not brave
and I'm not stupid.

414
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,333
I've got 30 seconds
to finish my drink...

415
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:07,002
before they
show me the door.

416
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:10,839
Is there any way I could
see you later on tonight?

417
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,845
Sure, if you don't mind
looking up from a grave.

418
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,973
Just tell me
where to go.

419
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:23,727
Charley Pearl!

420
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,021
The toothpaste king!

421
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:31,360
Why do you want to die if
you're worth 40 million bucks?

422
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:34,696
30 million,
and I don't want to die.

423
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,865
I just want to
see you later on.

424
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:38,408
Why?

425
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:44,039
Some things are worth
risking your life for.

426
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,336
You have five seconds
to make up your mind.

427
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:54,925
No. What is
wrong with me?

428
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,055
They'll kill us both
ifhe catches us.

429
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:04,726
Makes life interesting,
doesn't it?

430
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,772
Five Yucca Ridge Road.

431
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:11,024
Don't come if
the porch light is on.

432
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:14,570
I'll leave the side window open.
I must be crazy.!

433
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,783
I've had enough.
I loved the show.

434
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:22,077
Next time, I'll bring
the wife and kids.

435
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,538
I know the way out.

436
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:32,546
Jesus, the creeps
they let in this joint!

437
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:49,605
[Phil] Now, Charley's brain
knew that what he was doin'...

438
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:52,774
was dumb
and dangerous.

439
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:57,738
The problem was, his brain
was no longer drivin'the bus.

440
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:03,327
Charley was about to break
the two golden rules:

441
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,788
One, never fool around
with a gangster's girl.

442
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:11,335
And two, never fool around
with a gangster's girl.

443
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:18,091
[Whispers]
Where are you?

444
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:20,344
Pulling down the shade
would be a smart move.

445
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:23,847
Right.

446
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,359
Hi.

447
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:38,987
Okay, so you're here.
What do you want?

448
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:41,823
I thought maybe
we'd talk.

449
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:43,867
About what?

450
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:46,870
I mean... what do
you mean, about what?

451
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:50,999
I'm risking a bullet in my head
to come see you.

452
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:54,378
I got the impression that
you want to see me, too.

453
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,630
So, what do you
want to do?

454
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:59,842
Well, a drink
would be nice.

455
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:02,386
Soft music maybe.

456
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,471
About my career.

457
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:09,685
Oh.

458
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:12,521
Well, uh,
I meant what I said.

459
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:15,023
I could introduce you
to some influential people.

460
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:18,402
More important
than Benny Siegel?

461
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:21,488
Well...

462
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:24,074
without those two gorillas,
Benny Siegel...

463
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:27,494
isn't anymore important than...
the doorman.

464
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:29,705
Doormen open doors,
Charley.

465
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:33,333
Judging from your looks
and this bungalow...

466
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:36,336
I think he had something
else in mind, don't you?

467
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,672
And I suppose
you don't.

468
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:42,050
He gave you this job.
But I don't think...

469
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:45,053
he's really going to
push your career.

470
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:47,764
Whereas I am prepared
to pick up this phone...

471
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:51,226
and get you an appointment
with Decca Records.

472
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,687
Why would you
do that for me?

473
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,064
Why did you
leave the window open?

474
00:30:59,318 --> 00:31:03,197
I don't know.
I don't know.

475
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,075
Besides, Benny's gettin'
ready to dump me.

476
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:12,247
That's what he went
to pick up in Chicago.

477
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,589
Look, I gotta
tell you this.

478
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:24,635
I couldn't take my eyes
off you in that club.

479
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:26,720
When I was sitting
next to you...

480
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:29,806
I had to fight to keep
my hands off you.

481
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:42,402
You know, sometimes
something strange...

482
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:45,447
something special happens
between a man and woman.

483
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:48,992
She may not be right for him,
or he for her, but...

484
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:51,119
it happens anyway.

485
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:54,289
And there's not a damn thing
either one can do about it.

486
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:58,085
- [Chuckling]
- Are you laughing at me?

487
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:00,921
Yeah.

488
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:03,340
But don't go away.

489
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,761
On the other hand, Adele...

490
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:10,848
the woman I'm suppose
to be married to...

491
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:13,684
she is the absolute
right woman for me.

492
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:17,187
Lucky Adele.

493
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:20,107
D[Big Band Music]

494
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,317
Except I don't wanna...

495
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:25,863
devour every inch
of her flesh...

496
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:28,699
the way I want
to do right now.

497
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:36,164
- Know what I'm talking about?
- Shut up, Charley.

498
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:05,152
Oh, you smell so good.

499
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,740
[Phone Ringing]

500
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:11,909
It's Benny.
I've got to answer it.

501
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:13,911
Forget about him.

502
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:17,164
You gotta let me up.

503
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:19,416
He'll kill us both
if I don't answer.

504
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:25,547
Hello.

505
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:28,926
Hello?
Benny, hi!

506
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:32,888
No, I was just working
out on the floor.

507
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,556
I just...

508
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,767
I know you'll be home
in a few days, and I...

509
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,061
just wanted to
get in shape for you.

510
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:42,940
Me, too, babe.
Oh, with my heart.

511
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:47,110
Okay, sure.
Bye.

512
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:55,702
- He has somebody new, all right.
- Forget about him.

513
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,792
She was workin' out
on the floor.

514
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:05,379
What did this guy
look like?

515
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:08,549
Pretty,
flashy smile.

516
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:11,593
A country club
shithead.

517
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:15,097
This is very
disappointin' to me.

518
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:19,893
You know
what I mean?

519
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:26,066
Ooo. You're an animal.

520
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:29,236
You leave some pretty good
teeth marks, yourself.

521
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:36,577
That girl you're marrying?
What's her name?

522
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:41,665
Um...

523
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,667
Adele!

524
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:48,964
Tell her she's going to have a short,
but happy, life.

525
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:54,761
I once swung at a golf ball
and thought I missed it...

526
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:59,183
until I look up and I see
it climbing in the sky...

527
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:02,352
two hundred yards away,
still climbing.

528
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:05,189
And then it drops...

529
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:08,483
on the green
two inches from the pin.

530
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:12,154
That is the only time
I've ever felt...

531
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:15,699
anything perfect
in my whole life...

532
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:19,203
until right now.

533
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:22,789
[Giggling]

534
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:26,043
That's the first time
I ever felt like a golf ball.

535
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:30,672
I've gotta see you again.
We've gotta work it out.

536
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:35,886
That's not my problem,
Charley.

537
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,888
Ah!

538
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:41,350
You'll have to take
that up with Bugsy.

539
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:45,395
[Bugsy] That's the first time
you've ever called me Bugsy.

540
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:51,401
- Oh, my God.
- Um...

541
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:54,696
- Well...
- This is bad. This is so bad.

542
00:35:57,616 --> 00:36:01,370
I couldn't see much,
but it didn't sound good.

543
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:04,081
- Benny, listen to me.
- Call me Bugsy.

544
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:06,750
Benny'd be an insult
to me now.

545
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:10,045
Mr. Siegel,
this is all my fault.

546
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:12,214
She turned me down
at the bar.

547
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:15,843
I followed her car out here
and broke into this room.

548
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:18,929
I forced her,
I swear to God.

549
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:22,599
You know, I believe
this to be true...

550
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:25,894
'cause Vicki would never
do such a thing, not to me.

551
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:30,440
And so you won, huh?

552
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:33,443
Gee...

553
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:36,905
you must've ripped
her clothes right off.

554
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:38,907
You dragged her
into this bed, right?

555
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:41,034
- Right.
- I bet she kicked and screamed.

556
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:44,746
She must have begged you!
And you said what?

557
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:48,542
You said, "Shut up, baby,
'cause I'm takin' what I want."

558
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,961
Right. That's exactly what I said.

559
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:54,423
Is that right, sweetheart?
Is that the way he did it?

560
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:57,426
Uh, yeah, I guess.
I mean...

561
00:36:57,467 --> 00:37:00,762
No, I'm... I'm so scared
I don't know what to say.

562
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:05,309
Gee, this is
some ordeal.

563
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:09,396
You know what
I don't get?

564
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:11,940
- What's your name?
- Charley.

565
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:14,276
What I don't get
is why?

566
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,778
You knew she
was my girl.

567
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:21,575
You knew what would happen
if you got caught.

568
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:24,995
And you were
that hot to trot?

569
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:27,998
You were that hot
to get into her pants?

570
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:30,918
That what?
Charley!

571
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:34,922
Well, I, uh...
I, uh...

572
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:38,342
I must've been drunk...
too much celebrating.

573
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,802
I was out here on
my bachelor party.

574
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:43,514
Right. I heard that.

575
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:46,642
Gettin' married, huh?
That's nice.

576
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:51,480
- Congratulations, Charley.
- Thank you.

577
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:56,860
[Sighs]

578
00:37:56,944 --> 00:38:00,197
You must be as embarrassed
about this as I am, right?

579
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,826
Yes, this...
this is embarrassing.

580
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,955
All right.

581
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:10,207
I'll tell you what.

582
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,376
Why don't you
both get dressed...

583
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:14,837
'cause I think
we have to talk.

584
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,340
Let's get an ice cream soda
somewhere, shall we?

585
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,971
Hmm.

586
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:27,057
What'd you say your old man
would pay for you, Charley?

587
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,059
Pay for me?

588
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:31,687
- You mean, as in ransom?
- Naw.

589
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,898
This ain't no kidnap.
This is a probable cement job.

590
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:37,067
Couple of million,
you think?

591
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,069
[Gasps]

592
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:41,905
I would like to avoid
involving my father.

593
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:44,575
- He's very old, very sick.
- I see.

594
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:47,035
But I'll give you
whatever I have.

595
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,997
Then you're gonna pay
for Vicki, too?

596
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,749
You two going Dutch?

597
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:55,711
- Come on.
- Benny, I'm sorry.

598
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:58,380
- I really am sorry.
- Oh, ho-ho.

599
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:01,425
Hey, baby,
level with me.

600
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:04,845
Is he really an animal
like you said?

601
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:09,016
Well, uh, that was
just something to say.

602
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:13,353
- I mean...
- Ha, ha, ha!

603
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:19,234
What's so funny, Charley?

604
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:22,362
- Oh, no.
- I'm so scared!

605
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:26,241
I mean, I'm really...

606
00:39:26,283 --> 00:39:28,285
I'm really scared.

607
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:30,913
I don't think I've ever
been this scared...

608
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:33,957
in my whole life.

609
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:37,127
That's good.
You just relax, buddy.

610
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:39,880
'Cause you'll stop
laughing real quick.

611
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:50,265
Wake up.

612
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:52,643
Mr. Siegel has
a job for you.

613
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:56,104
- Where are we?
- My problem is this.

614
00:39:56,188 --> 00:40:01,109
Vicki was on
her way out anyway.

615
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:03,487
She was
a good kid.

616
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,906
And I always figured
I'd set her up...

617
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:09,243
a little business somewhere,
a few bucks in her account.

618
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:12,454
Two years with Benny,
huh, baby?

619
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:17,417
Entitles you to a little
security, don't you think?

620
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:20,671
I'll make out,
I swear.

621
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:23,257
On the other hand,
if a guy screws my girl...

622
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,843
he's gotta
pay for her.

623
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:30,138
So why not pay both
bills at the same time?

624
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:34,643
Come here.

625
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:38,939
You marry her, Charley.

626
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:41,316
That takes care
ofher security.

627
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,443
And she marries you.

628
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:46,530
Then I fucked up your life,
'cause she's no damn good.

629
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:49,491
Everybody gets something this way, see?

630
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:53,662
That's how I've run the biggest
hotel in Las Vegas, Charley.

631
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:56,039
Bobby, you want to hit it?

632
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:58,292
You gotta be kidding me.

633
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:01,003
I can't marry her.
I'm marrying somebody else.

634
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:03,630
I know, the Hollywood
big shot's daughter.

635
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:06,300
After he reads
the morning papers...

636
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:09,052
he's gonna cancel
the caterers.

637
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:11,221
Vicki, come on.

638
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:13,307
Take the arm
of your animal.

639
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,184
Come on.

640
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:18,145
- Step up to the altar.
- This is crazy!

641
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:20,063
This is what?

642
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:23,859
- It's not that.
We don't have a wedding license.
- No.

643
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:26,862
It's okay.
I own the chapel.

644
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:29,406
- We don't have a ring.
- No, we don't.

645
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,575
[Clanking]

646
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:33,160
Ah!

647
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,211
Uh, uh...

648
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:44,546
- What?
- Can I see your hand?

649
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:46,548
Anything here
with your size?

650
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:49,551
- Try this one.
- That doesn't fit. I can tell by...

651
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:53,555
- Give me that one back.
- That's not the one.

652
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:55,557
- I've got it on my finger.
- That's mine.

653
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:57,851
- That's the one I give you.
- This one isn't right.

654
00:41:57,935 --> 00:41:59,853
We're just workin' out
the ring thing.

655
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:02,356
Got it.

656
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:09,947
Do you,
Victoria Rosemary Anderson...

657
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:14,034
take Charles for your
lawful wedded husband?

658
00:42:17,621 --> 00:42:19,873
I'm sorry,
we can't hear in the back.

659
00:42:19,957 --> 00:42:23,085
Speak up, dear.

660
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,588
Uh, she did.

661
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:28,632
And do you,
Charles Raymond Pearl...

662
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:30,926
take Victoria to be your
lawfully wedded wife...

663
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:34,429
for as long as you
both shall live?

664
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:40,102
It... It's not
that you're, uh...

665
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:42,604
I really think
that you're, uh...

666
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:45,148
The thing is, that...

667
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,820
Yeah, I do.

668
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:52,239
- Did you hear that?
- Perfectly.

669
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:54,616
With the power
vested in me...

670
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,829
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

671
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,293
[Bugsy]
Hey, no kiss?

672
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:06,336
Where's the kiss?

673
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:10,841
We've seen the other stuff.
We want to see a little kiss.

674
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:23,812
D["The Wedding March"]

675
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:35,115
Rush it. I want to make
that early edition.

676
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:37,326
No problem.

677
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:40,037
You know what, Charley?

678
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,623
I got a feeling one day
you're gonna wish...

679
00:43:42,706 --> 00:43:44,958
we gave you
that cement job.

680
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,545
I just said to the guys yesterday...

681
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:50,672
"Hot always gets you
into trouble."

682
00:43:50,756 --> 00:43:53,884
When you're hot, you can bet
it's gonna screw up your life.

683
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:55,969
I didn't rape you.

684
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:59,014
I just left
the window open a little.

685
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:02,351
It's too bad you don't have
the balls you had last night.

686
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:05,646
Did I blame you?
It's my mistake.

687
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:09,149
- I'm the one that made the first move.
- Gee, thanks.

688
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:11,568
Are you always
gonna be...

689
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:14,071
this cheerful
in the morning?

690
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:17,241
What mornings? This is
the first morning and the last.

691
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:19,535
What I said last night
was the truth.

692
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:22,037
It was the greatest
experience of my life.

693
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,207
I want you. I just don't
want to be married to you.

694
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,668
I cannot believe
that I'm driving around...

695
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:30,003
in a brand-new
Packard convertible...

696
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:33,507
married to a man worth millions,
and I want to throw up!

697
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,926
I was the only one having
a good time last night?

698
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:38,929
- Maybe.
- Do you always moan, scream...

699
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:41,890
and drive your fingernails into
somebody you're bored with?

700
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:45,727
No, I really had
a terrific time last night.

701
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:48,730
It's just that I haven't
been happy since we got married.

702
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:51,608
We'll get it annulled as
soon as we get back to L.A.

703
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:54,069
Fast enough for you,
lover boy?

704
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:57,447
No, we can
do it quicker.

705
00:44:57,531 --> 00:45:00,701
I have a lawyer in Palm Springs.
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

706
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:05,080
Fine. Does breakfast
go with that?

707
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:07,207
Look, I'll make good.

708
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,418
I'll come up
with a settlement.

709
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:12,296
10, 20 thousand...
whatever you want.

710
00:45:15,132 --> 00:45:18,719
Don't treat me like
a bimbo, Charley.

711
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:22,222
It's my wedding day.

712
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:24,266
I'm sorry.

713
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:28,896
I didn't mean to...
I'm really sorry.

714
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:41,617
Oh, shit!

715
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,661
Wow!

716
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:47,456
I've never been on
the front page before.

717
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:50,959
Could I have a few
to send to my family?

718
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:55,422
"Heir forsakes studio princess
for lounge singer."

719
00:45:55,506 --> 00:45:57,508
Those'll do.

720
00:45:58,884 --> 00:46:02,262
I wonder what it would cost
to buy every copy in L.A.?

721
00:46:02,346 --> 00:46:07,017
If she loves you,
she'll wait for you.

722
00:46:09,394 --> 00:46:13,106
Her father's probably
waiting for me, too.

723
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,108
I wish I was dead.

724
00:46:15,192 --> 00:46:16,693
Thanks.

725
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,282
Hey.!

726
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:26,870
- You coming?
- I don't think so.

727
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,794
Where are you
gonna go?

728
00:46:33,877 --> 00:46:38,006
You don't have any money,
a car, any clothes.

729
00:46:38,048 --> 00:46:41,009
Come on.
I'll set you up in L.A.

730
00:46:41,093 --> 00:46:44,137
You know,
you guys are all alike.

731
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:49,184
There are two things
I'm gonna do from now on...

732
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:52,062
I'm gonna
earn my own living...

733
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:54,857
and I'm gonna
keep my window shut.

734
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,734
So long, Charley.

735
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:07,703
Three months!

736
00:47:07,786 --> 00:47:11,081
You want Adele Horner
to wait three months...

737
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:14,543
until you get annulled from
some cheap, blonde bombshell...

738
00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:16,920
bimbo cocktail waitress?

739
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:19,673
She's not a cocktail waitress.
She sings with a band.

740
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:22,176
I've been trying
to tell you...

741
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:24,720
we did not get married
of our own free will!

742
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:27,848
We were kidnapped and forced
to get married at gunpoint.

743
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:30,017
At gunpoint?

744
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,394
What is that,
a new crime wave?

745
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:35,105
They grab people on the street
and make them get married?

746
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:37,524
I warned you about him,
didn't I?

747
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:41,278
Nobody gets forced to get married
at gunpoint except hillbillies.

748
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:45,949
And you're no hillbilly, you pervert
polo-playing goddamn playboy!

749
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:50,245
- Do I look stupid?
Do I look like a schmuck?
- No, sir.

750
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:53,540
Bugsy Siegel may be crazy.
But stupid, he's not.

751
00:47:53,624 --> 00:47:56,752
Those people out there
kill for power, money!

752
00:47:56,835 --> 00:47:59,087
But this thing
he did for revenge.

753
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:02,216
For talking to his ex-girlfriend
he might break your legs.

754
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:05,052
- You got broken legs, Charley?
- No, sir.

755
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:11,058
What else did you do
besides talk to her?

756
00:48:12,976 --> 00:48:16,230
The rest of the story
contains certain...

757
00:48:16,313 --> 00:48:19,274
indelicacies which are
best discussed among men.

758
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:22,110
Indelicacies?

759
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:25,781
We sent out 400
wedding invitations!

760
00:48:25,822 --> 00:48:30,744
The governor and both senators
are flying in from Washington!

761
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:34,122
On this morning's front page
of the Los Angeles Globe...

762
00:48:34,206 --> 00:48:36,166
is a picture of you...

763
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:39,127
Bugsy Siegel,
and the bimbo getting married...

764
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:42,005
in some Las Vegas
quickie wedding chapel.

765
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:45,968
On page 12 is the announcement
of the engagement...

766
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:48,470
of my daughter
to the same man...

767
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:50,514
whose fucking picture
is on page one.

768
00:48:50,556 --> 00:48:52,808
And you want to talk
about indelicacies!

769
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:56,144
I can see you don't want
to hear my side of the story.

770
00:48:56,228 --> 00:49:00,440
They're laughing at me
at every studio in town.

771
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:05,279
I make family pictures!
Families bring their kids.

772
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:08,532
Children sing songs,
and buy toy bunny rabbits...

773
00:49:08,615 --> 00:49:12,119
and ducks that go
"quack" in my pictures.

774
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:14,329
I'll break your ass,
you fucking little shithead.

775
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:16,957
Get out of my house
before I kick you out.

776
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,293
- I'm sorry, Adele.
- Don't talk to him.

777
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:22,337
- You'll never forgive me.
- She doesn't forgive you.!

778
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:24,798
- I'd like to explain it.
- Get the fuck out of here!

779
00:49:24,882 --> 00:49:27,676
I'm not going to give up,
because I'm in love with you!

780
00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:31,180
Mr. Horner,
we'll talk.

781
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:33,473
You'd better start
eating at home...

782
00:49:33,557 --> 00:49:36,143
'cause you won't get into
a restaurant in this city.

783
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:39,062
You won't get a table,
a chair, a plate...

784
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:42,191
a piece of lettuce
that dropped off the tray!

785
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:45,235
You're through in this town.
You're a dead man.

786
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:48,989
In tomorrow's obituaries,
I'm puttin' in...

787
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:51,200
"Died today,
Charles Raymond Pearl.

788
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:53,202
"Cause of death...

789
00:49:53,243 --> 00:49:57,581
a fucking flaw
in his fucking character."

790
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:05,422
Dl just want
to swing with you

791
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:07,424
- d Swing with you d
- Take that down.

792
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:10,928
Charley.

793
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:14,598
This thing...
it'll pass.

794
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:19,603
Maybe not in our lifetime,
but it'll pass.

795
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,068
The guy's not eating.

796
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:29,905
- You gotta eat, Charley.
- I'm not hungry.

797
00:50:29,947 --> 00:50:31,949
[Sighs]

798
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,909
He's not hungry.

799
00:50:36,328 --> 00:50:38,956
You gotta get
out more, Charley.

800
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:41,750
You can't stay cooped up
on the patio...

801
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:44,253
Iooking out at the same
panoramic view every night.

802
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:47,756
Forget it.
No woman is worth starving for.

803
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:51,593
- Just another broad.
- Adele Horner is no broad.

804
00:50:51,677 --> 00:50:54,054
Thought you were
thinking of Vicki.

805
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:56,932
Have you heard
from her?

806
00:50:57,015 --> 00:50:59,601
- Vicki?
- No, Adele.

807
00:50:59,685 --> 00:51:02,104
They won't put
my calls through.

808
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:04,314
I hear she's
in San Diego.

809
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:08,569
- Adele?
- No, Vicki.

810
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:11,446
She's singing
in some joint.

811
00:51:20,163 --> 00:51:22,958
I just can't get that woman
out of my mind.

812
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:30,507
Which one?

813
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:32,843
Excuse me,
Mr. Charley.

814
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:36,805
There's a lady here
to see you.

815
00:51:41,185 --> 00:51:43,312
Even money,
it's Adele.

816
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:45,939
I'll take a C-note
on the songbird.

817
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:50,360
You got my letter?

818
00:51:50,444 --> 00:51:54,114
I hate you so much...

819
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:57,034
because I'm still
in love with you...

820
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:59,453
partly because
you're so bad...

821
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:01,830
and partly because
you're so honest.

822
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:05,167
I don't know another man who'd
admit to his future wife...

823
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,169
that he'd slept
with another woman...

824
00:52:07,252 --> 00:52:10,214
six days before
their wedding.

825
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:13,675
I think Mr. Siegel
let you off easy.

826
00:52:13,717 --> 00:52:16,303
If I had walked into that room
and saw you in bed...

827
00:52:16,386 --> 00:52:19,515
I would have shot you
and her on the spot.

828
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:23,060
Especially her!

829
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:27,648
You go and write these loving
things to me on "last page,"

830
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:30,526
and I don't know
what to think.

831
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:32,528
Do you still want
to marry me?

832
00:52:32,611 --> 00:52:34,530
- Yes, Adele.
- Why?

833
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:37,157
- I'm still in love with you.
- Why did you sleep with her?

834
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:40,869
- You won't like my answer.
- Say it anyway.

835
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:45,207
I just had
to have her.

836
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,920
You're right,
I hate it.

837
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:52,339
- Do you still see her?
- No.

838
00:52:52,422 --> 00:52:55,217
- Do you still want her? Don't lie.
- No.!

839
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:57,719
A little,
but it'll go away.

840
00:52:57,761 --> 00:53:00,389
- Oh, Charley.
- Marry me, Adele.

841
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:03,016
I'll never see her again.
I'll stop wanting her.

842
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,769
- I swear.
- You're still lying.

843
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:08,730
Not to me,
but to yourself.

844
00:53:13,193 --> 00:53:18,115
I'm going to Europe with
my father for three months.

845
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:23,078
You should be free from
that... person by then.

846
00:53:23,161 --> 00:53:25,372
I'll be home
on September 9th.

847
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:28,959
You can call me
on September 10th.

848
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,797
Good-bye, Charley.

849
00:53:35,507 --> 00:53:38,427
[Phil] And so,
Adele went to Europe to think...

850
00:53:38,468 --> 00:53:40,596
and Charley buried himself
in his work...

851
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:45,392
Well, playboy work.
But his heartjust wasn't in it.

852
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:00,908
Heyyy!

853
00:54:03,493 --> 00:54:05,078
Ah, shit!

854
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:15,297
If Adele didn't
come home soon...

855
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:20,177
there wouldn't be much
of Charley to come home to.

856
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:23,138
Then, finally it came...
September 10th.

857
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:27,476
The morning line on Adele
saying "yes"was eight to five.

858
00:54:27,518 --> 00:54:30,771
I took the odds
and bet on cupid.

859
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:34,691
So...

860
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:40,989
- did you miss Adele, Charley?
- Yes, sir.

861
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:45,160
- Have you been behaving yourself?
- Yes, sir.

862
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:48,664
You haven't been seeing
anyone you shouldn't be?

863
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:52,543
Yes, sir.
Sorry... no, sir.

864
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:59,341
I was young once myself,
Charley.

865
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:03,136
And I also made some
big mistakes in my time.

866
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:06,014
But I did everything I could
to rectify those mistakes.

867
00:55:06,098 --> 00:55:08,016
I understand.

868
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:12,688
It would take you
1200 years to rectify yours.

869
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:15,732
That's a long time to wait
to start a family.

870
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:18,986
Yes, sir.

871
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:21,989
So here's the deal.

872
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:24,700
You get married
one week from tonight...

873
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:27,661
a simple ceremony,
no guests, quiet as a grave.

874
00:55:27,744 --> 00:55:30,664
A retired judge will
do it in my study.

875
00:55:30,747 --> 00:55:32,916
The servants will be
given the night off.

876
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,836
I'm takin' no chances on
another scandal, understand?

877
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:37,504
Perfectly, sir.

878
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:40,757
One other item.

879
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:43,218
I want you to put up
a half-a-million-dollar bond...

880
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:45,220
to be held in escrow.

881
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:48,223
At the end of the ceremony,
it'll be returned to you.

882
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:52,352
If you don't show up, you'll be the
generous benefactor of an orphanage.

883
00:55:52,436 --> 00:55:55,606
- Is that acceptable?
- It's not to me!

884
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:58,567
I don't think I should have to
buy someone to marry me.

885
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:01,069
He's not being bought
to marry you...

886
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:03,530
but he's paying up
if he doesn't.

887
00:56:03,614 --> 00:56:06,241
That's acceptable
to me, sir.

888
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:10,120
A final item...

889
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:12,915
Not a word of
this wedding to anyone.

890
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:17,294
- If there's a leak or rumor, it's off.
- You have my word.

891
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:20,380
Put the check on
the desk in my library.

892
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:24,927
Make it out to the
Culver City Boys' Orphanage.

893
00:56:29,806 --> 00:56:32,726
I regret using such foul
language at our last meeting.

894
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:34,937
It was uncharacteristic of me.

895
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:38,065
I deserved it, sir.

896
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:40,734
I'll see you here
one week from tonight.

897
00:56:40,817 --> 00:56:43,070
If not, the next time you
go on a honeymoon...

898
00:56:43,153 --> 00:56:45,739
you'll go as a eunuch.

899
00:56:50,035 --> 00:56:52,079
[Phil]
Okay, two nights later...

900
00:56:52,162 --> 00:56:54,122
Tony was opening at
the St. Tropez Club...

901
00:56:54,206 --> 00:56:58,919
with a couple of new songs
Sammy had written just for him.

902
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:01,755
It's a big night for everybody,
very big.

903
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,634
- What happened with Adele?
- Nothing much. She's fine.

904
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:07,845
I can't get a word
outta this guy.

905
00:57:07,928 --> 00:57:10,806
Charley, something's cooking.
I can tell.

906
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:13,350
Nothing.
I swear.

907
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:18,021
It's not my night.
Everything's going wrong.

908
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:22,317
Tony's nervous 'cause the
MGM people didn't show yet.

909
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:24,653
Then, the opening act cancels.
Laryngitis.

910
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:27,614
- Honey, what a shame.
- No opening act?

911
00:57:27,698 --> 00:57:30,325
What's he need?
20, 30 minutes?

912
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:32,828
I would do this for Tony,
nobody else.

913
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:36,832
Relax. They got somebody else.
Just sit down.

914
00:57:36,874 --> 00:57:39,168
Ladies and gentlemen,
the management regrets...

915
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:42,504
Miss Amber Wayne
will be unable to appear...

916
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:47,009
but delights presenting in her
first Los Angeles appearance...

917
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:50,512
Miss Vicki Anderson.

918
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:55,809
Jesus.

919
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:58,478
You know what the odds are
on this happening?

920
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,480
Impossible to one.

921
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:03,984
D Every honey bee d

922
00:58:04,067 --> 00:58:07,654
d Fills with jealousy d

923
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:11,158
d When they see you out

00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:16,580
d I don't blame them

926
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:25,589
dDon't cry

927
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:29,051
d Sugar d

928
00:58:29,092 --> 00:58:32,846
d You just have
to touch my cup d

929
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:37,226
d You're my sugar

930
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:39,520
She looks familiar.

931
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:43,357
Charley, isn't that...
Ow!

932
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:46,735
Charley, I didn't know
it was gonna be her.

933
00:58:46,777 --> 00:58:50,113
- I gotta get outta here.
- And miss Tony's opening?

934
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:54,368
- He'll never forgive you.
- If Lew Horner finds out that
she and I are in the same club...

935
00:58:54,409 --> 00:58:56,036
he's gonna call
the whole thing off.

936
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:58,413
- Call what off?
- That's it! I knew it.

937
00:58:58,455 --> 00:59:01,792
- You and Adele are getting married.
- Not unless I beat it now!

938
00:59:03,961 --> 00:59:05,838
Tell Tony I got sick.

939
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:10,968
- What's wrong with him?
- Slight heart attack.

940
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:14,388
D You just have to

941
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:16,974

Mmm-yeah.

951
01:00:00,893 --> 01:00:03,729
Good. She's very good.

952
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:22,372
There wasn't a window,
so I decided to use the door.

953
01:00:27,252 --> 01:00:29,755
So how are you?

954
01:00:32,424 --> 01:00:35,093
I'm okay.

955
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:39,681
I see you didn't
have any trouble...

956
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:42,351
getting back
on your feet.

957
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:51,360
I really shouldn't be here
talking to you.

958
01:00:51,401 --> 01:00:55,614
It usually gets us
in trouble.

959
01:00:55,697 --> 01:00:59,117
Oh, God.!
I'm so clumsy.!

960
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:01,870
Let me help you
with that.

961
01:01:03,789 --> 01:01:06,542
I guess I shouldn't
tell you this either...

962
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:09,878
but I'm supposed to be...
getting married...

963
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,090
on Tuesday.

964
01:01:13,173 --> 01:01:15,217
Well!

965
01:01:15,259 --> 01:01:18,804
Good for Adele.

966
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:21,056
She hung in there.

967
01:01:21,098 --> 01:01:22,724
Yeah.

968
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:24,476
So how 'bout you?

969
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,814
- Charley...
- I mean, are you seeing anybody?

970
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:31,567
I've only been
annulled two weeks.

971
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:33,944
What's the rush?

972
01:01:34,027 --> 01:01:35,988
Yeah.

973
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:40,075
Tony's gonna kill me
if I don't see the show.

974
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:42,619
Your life is always
being threatened...

975
01:01:42,703 --> 01:01:45,956
isn't it, Charley?

976
01:01:45,998 --> 01:01:48,333
I really gotta go.

977
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:51,837
I just wanted to drop by
and say hello.

978
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,257
The real reason
I came by was to see...

979
01:01:55,299 --> 01:01:58,760
if I could be around you
and still want to get married.

980
01:01:58,844 --> 01:02:02,431
I guess I'm reasonably safe.

981
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:09,313
Well, you know how I like
to see you happy, Charley.

982
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:15,319
Well...

983
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:19,323
bye.

984
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,127
- I was just thinking...
- I was just thinking...

985
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:34,129
Me, too. What?

986
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:37,674
If you weren't going
to be too long...

987
01:02:37,758 --> 01:02:41,303
maybe I could...
give you a ride home.

988
01:02:42,554 --> 01:02:44,473
I have a car.

989
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:50,521
Mine's bigger.

Oh, Jesus.

1016
01:04:50,933 --> 01:04:53,936
That just cost me
a half-a-million bucks.

1017
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:56,813
No, mister.

1018
01:04:56,897 --> 01:05:00,692
That... was just
for old-time's sake.

1019
01:05:04,154 --> 01:05:06,323
I don't think so.

1020
01:05:06,406 --> 01:05:09,535
You know it
and I know it.

1021
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:14,706
It's gonna be like this
for the rest of our lives.

1022
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:17,626
When you walked away
from me that day...

1023
01:05:17,668 --> 01:05:20,629
flat as a penny,
without a red cent...

1024
01:05:20,671 --> 01:05:22,714
I couldn't believe it.

1025
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:26,301
I said to myself...

1026
01:05:26,343 --> 01:05:30,472
"If I had a woman
like that...

1027
01:05:30,514 --> 01:05:33,809
I would want to spend
the rest of my life with her."

1028
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:35,936
Charley...

1029
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:39,439
do you really love me?

1030
01:05:39,523 --> 01:05:41,984
I mean,
really love me?

1031
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:44,361
'Cause when you walked out
of my dressing room...

1032
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:46,780
and I thought you were
never coming back...

1033
01:05:46,864 --> 01:05:50,033
I wanted to die.

1034
01:06:01,378 --> 01:06:04,047
I do love you,
baby.

1035
01:06:05,883 --> 01:06:09,052
I have never been
this happy...

1036
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:13,390
in my entire,
spoiled, rotten life.

1037
01:06:21,023 --> 01:06:24,276
[Phil] It was a beautiful wedding,
even better than the first.

1038
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:27,029
Better entertainment.
I was the best man.

1039
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:29,573
I did 40 minutes
ofboffo material.

1040
01:06:29,656 --> 01:06:32,409
It was beautiful,
not to brag.

1041
01:06:32,492 --> 01:06:35,245
Tony sang a song that Sammy
wrote for the occasion called...

1042
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:38,916
"The girl that I marry,
then married. "

1043
01:06:38,999 --> 01:06:42,169
The other girls, being single,
naturally cried at the wedding.

1044
01:06:42,252 --> 01:06:44,671
Somewhere else
in Hollywood...

1045
01:06:44,755 --> 01:06:47,257
someone was crying
more than anybody.

1046
01:06:52,721 --> 01:06:55,891
He's dead!
The man is dead.

1047
01:06:55,974 --> 01:06:58,268
I'll get pictures
of him dead.

1048
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:02,272
You can pin 'em on your wall
and throw darts at them.

1049
01:07:02,314 --> 01:07:05,776
Last time, he tells us,
he got married at gunpoint.

1050
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:09,112
What did they have this time?
A cannon?

1051
01:07:12,157 --> 01:07:14,034
Mr. Pearl?

1052
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:20,123
We're almost done packing.
I'll call you to pick up the bags.

1053
01:07:20,207 --> 01:07:23,210
We got a going-away
gift for you...

1054
01:07:23,293 --> 01:07:25,963
from a friend.

1055
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:32,678
Wait a minute,
fellas.

1056
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:35,681
If he can pay you,
I'll pay you double.

1057
01:07:35,764 --> 01:07:38,642
He already paid us
double.

1058
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:40,811
Charley?

1059
01:07:44,356 --> 01:07:45,983
Aaah!

1060
01:07:47,985 --> 01:07:49,319
Aaah!

1061
01:07:58,453 --> 01:08:01,707
Daddy,
don't kill him.

1062
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:06,170
Maybe he'll change
his mind again.

1063
01:08:06,253 --> 01:08:09,923
What the hell did he see
in you in the first place?

1064
01:08:12,009 --> 01:08:14,469
Where are we goin',
fellas?

1065
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:38,035
Charley, Charley!

1066
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:42,915
Charley?
Charley?

1067
01:08:45,918 --> 01:08:49,630
I'm sorry about
the honeymoon, Vicki.

1068
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:53,383
Huh?

1069
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:58,138
I said, "I'm sorry
about the honeymoon."

1070
01:08:58,222 --> 01:09:00,682
Oh, that's okay,
honey.

1071
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:04,144
This is the second time
you haven't had one.

1072
01:09:04,228 --> 01:09:06,897
What did you say?
I can't hear you.

1073
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:11,652
- Excuse me.
- Oh! Oh, they're beautiful.

1074
01:09:13,403 --> 01:09:15,364
What is this?

1075
01:09:15,447 --> 01:09:18,825
Flowers from the
Culver City Boys' Orphanage.

1076
01:09:18,909 --> 01:09:21,453
Oh, Jesus.

1077
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:28,585
Tomorrow morning
at 8:00...

1078
01:09:28,627 --> 01:09:30,712
I start to take
swimming lessons.

1079
01:09:30,796 --> 01:09:34,258
I lose Esther Williams at the end
of the picture, but what the hell?

1080
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:36,343
Original score
by Frank Loesser...

1081
01:09:36,426 --> 01:09:39,888
- additional songs by Sammy Fine.
- That's great, Sam.

1082
01:09:39,972 --> 01:09:42,099
- It gets greater.
- Me...

1083
01:09:42,182 --> 01:09:44,977
Fred Astaire
and Rita Hayworth in one picture.

1084
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:48,230
- Co-Starring?
- Better, I play a funny taxi driver.

1085
01:09:48,313 --> 01:09:50,274
I got one dynamite scene...

1086
01:09:50,315 --> 01:09:53,110
and let Fred and Rita
carry the heavy plot. I'm no dope.

1087
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:55,320
- Terrific, fellas.
- Let's not forget George.

1088
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:57,906
Cincinnati's won
four games in a row!

1089
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:00,951
And Charley's got Vicki.
Everyone finishes in the money!

1090
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:03,871
I gotta call Vicki.
She had an audition at Paramount.

1091
01:10:03,954 --> 01:10:05,956
I wanna see
how she made out.

1092
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:10,377
I could tell him.
Nobody's hiring wives of Charley Pearl.

1093
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:13,422
The irony is,
if he'd married Adele...

1094
01:10:13,505 --> 01:10:16,633
- Vicki would be working today.
- Tell him.

1095
01:10:16,717 --> 01:10:19,219
He loves stories
about irony.

1096
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:33,150
[Vicki]
Charley?

1097
01:10:33,192 --> 01:10:37,196
Charley,
guess what?

1098
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:42,242
They want to test me
at Monogram Pictures.

1099
01:10:42,326 --> 01:10:44,494
It's not a
werewolf picture.

1100
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:47,623
It's a really big
musical!

1101
01:10:47,706 --> 01:10:49,791
Oh, oh!

1102
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:51,960
I've got to learn
two songs by Wednesday.

1103
01:10:52,044 --> 01:10:54,505
I've got to take some
really fast dancing lessons.

1104
01:10:54,546 --> 01:10:58,175
Charley, if I could just
show them what I can do.

1105
01:10:59,009 --> 01:11:02,054
What's wrong?

1106
01:11:02,137 --> 01:11:05,599
I'm leaving for Boston
in two hours.

1107
01:11:05,682 --> 01:11:08,101
My father
had a stroke.

1108
01:11:08,185 --> 01:11:11,355
They don't think he's
gonna last out the week.

1109
01:11:13,023 --> 01:11:15,400
Charley.

1110
01:11:15,484 --> 01:11:18,403
Oh, honey,
I'm sorry.

1111
01:11:18,487 --> 01:11:22,115
I never thought
about him dying.

1112
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:25,869
He didn't seem the type,
you know what I mean?

1113
01:11:27,496 --> 01:11:29,998
Did you talk to him?

1114
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:32,793
No, not really.
He's on oxygen.

1115
01:11:32,876 --> 01:11:35,128
Just a couple
of words.

1116
01:11:35,212 --> 01:11:38,257
What did he say?

1117
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:41,260
He said he wants
to meet you!

1118
01:11:41,343 --> 01:11:46,265
He said he's not going anywhere
'til he meets his daughter.

1119
01:11:46,348 --> 01:11:50,811
Even after everything
he's read about me?

1120
01:11:50,894 --> 01:11:53,397
Especially.

1121
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:57,150
I'll tell him
that you wanted to go.

1122
01:11:57,234 --> 01:11:59,695
I'm going with you.

1123
01:11:59,778 --> 01:12:02,072
I'll start packing.

1124
01:12:02,114 --> 01:12:05,450
I'll call Monogram.
They'll postpone the test.

1125
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:07,452
No, it doesn't matter.

1126
01:12:07,536 --> 01:12:10,664
There were ten other girls.
It was a long shot anyway.

1127
01:12:10,747 --> 01:12:13,166
I'll make it up to you.
I swear.

1128
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:17,296
Hey, I'm just glad
he wants to meet me.

1129
01:12:17,379 --> 01:12:20,424
[Phil]
When they got to Boston...

1130
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:22,759
Charley's father
was in a coma.

1131
01:12:22,843 --> 01:12:26,346
Well, they watched and waited...

1132
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,932
and waited and watched
for five solid days...

1133
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:31,977
just for the old man
to meet Vicki.

1134
01:12:33,437 --> 01:12:37,399
Honey, is it okay
if I go to the bathroom?

1135
01:12:37,482 --> 01:12:39,443
Yeah, sure.

1136
01:12:43,155 --> 01:12:45,324
I'll be right back.

1137
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:10,974
Where... is she?

1138
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:14,353
- Where is she!
- Vicki!

1139
01:13:14,436 --> 01:13:17,648
- Where is she?
- Vicki, hurry up!

1140
01:13:19,274 --> 01:13:21,485
[Vicki]
What?

1141
01:13:23,737 --> 01:13:25,656
What?

1142
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:29,993
You missed him.

1143
01:13:30,035 --> 01:13:32,412
[Phil]
So Charley lost his father...

1144
01:13:32,496 --> 01:13:34,831
and Vicki lost the part
at Monogram.

1145
01:13:34,873 --> 01:13:37,960
The girl who got it?
Bugsy Siegel's new girl...

1146
01:13:38,043 --> 01:13:40,087
the one he dumped
Vicki for.

1147
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:44,424
You know the odds on that?
You couldn't place the bet.!

1148
01:13:44,508 --> 01:13:49,137
- I'm real sorry he
never got to meet you.
- Yeah.

1149
01:13:49,179 --> 01:13:51,515
He had a
real nice face...

1150
01:13:51,557 --> 01:13:55,477
so... gentle.

1151
01:13:57,187 --> 01:14:00,315
Well, he
was in a coma.

1152
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:04,444
When are
we going home?

1153
01:14:04,528 --> 01:14:07,990
I've got some business
to take care of.

1154
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:10,868
I am the president
of the company now.

1155
01:14:10,951 --> 01:14:13,203
When can we leave?

1156
01:14:13,245 --> 01:14:17,666
I don't know.
I'd say in about two years.

1157
01:14:24,214 --> 01:14:28,343
After that, we'd only have to spend
seven or eight months a year here.

1158
01:14:31,555 --> 01:14:34,016
Two years?

1159
01:14:34,099 --> 01:14:36,560
Honey, the company
isn't doing well.

1160
01:14:36,643 --> 01:14:40,063
If I don't go to work,
we could lose everything.

1161
01:14:42,065 --> 01:14:43,984
Two years!

1162
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:47,029
You've got to give me
at least a year and a half.

1163
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:51,033
If a picture comes up,
you go to L.A. And do it.

1164
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:53,076
Pictures don't
come up in Boston.

1165
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,913
You don't get to do
screen tests in Massachusetts...

1166
01:14:55,996 --> 01:14:58,332
or meet directors or producers
on Plymouth Rock!

1167
01:14:58,415 --> 01:15:02,753
I had a hard enough time getting into
the studios when I was there every day.

1168
01:15:02,794 --> 01:15:05,714
- Why was that, Charley?
- It's a tough business.

1169
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:10,260
Especially when you're married
to the guy who dumped Adele Horner.

1170
01:15:10,344 --> 01:15:13,096
Right.
And who did I dump her for?

1171
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:15,891
Isn't that worth
two years of your life?

1172
01:15:15,933 --> 01:15:19,061
Is it a torture to live
in a place like this?

1173
01:15:19,102 --> 01:15:22,231
This is high society.
It doesn't get any higher.

1174
01:15:22,272 --> 01:15:25,400
I just want a chance
to do it on my own.

1175
01:15:25,442 --> 01:15:27,444
I can understand that.

1176
01:15:27,486 --> 01:15:30,280
All I want is
what's coming to me.

1177
01:15:30,322 --> 01:15:32,741
- Don't touch me.
- You're good at singing.

1178
01:15:32,783 --> 01:15:36,411
I'm very good at
inheriting money.

1179
01:15:36,495 --> 01:15:39,456
I may be the best
in my field.

1180
01:15:39,498 --> 01:15:44,127
I just don't want
to be without you.

1181
01:15:46,213 --> 01:15:50,259
I'll leave it up to you.
Whatever you decide is fine.

1182
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:56,431
You know I can't be
without you two years.

1183
01:15:56,515 --> 01:15:59,268
Oh, God!

1184
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:01,937
[Phil]
So they stayed...

1185
01:16:01,979 --> 01:16:05,774
and Vicki began the pleasant
process of fitting into Boston.

1186
01:16:05,816 --> 01:16:09,069
A lot of parties, new clothes,
a lot ofhats.

1187
01:16:09,152 --> 01:16:11,405
I recall she mentioned hats.

1188
01:16:11,488 --> 01:16:16,243
Meanwhile, Charley became obsessed
with saving the family business.

1189
01:16:16,326 --> 01:16:19,246
He was determined
to make the old man proud.

1190
01:16:19,329 --> 01:16:22,082
Vicki spent her nights alone
waiting for Charley.

1191
01:16:22,165 --> 01:16:24,084
He was very busy.

1192
01:16:24,168 --> 01:16:27,754
He was making major
important business decisions.

1193
01:16:27,838 --> 01:16:31,592
It needs a little more mint, guys.

1194
01:16:34,887 --> 01:16:38,473
Vicki, darling,
how long have you been here?

1195
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:42,978
Vicki, darling?

1196
01:16:45,189 --> 01:16:49,193
Oh, ah, two years.
We've been here two years.

1197
01:16:49,276 --> 01:16:51,945
Carl and I were
married two years...

1198
01:16:52,029 --> 01:16:53,947
when our
sex life died.

1199
01:16:54,031 --> 01:16:56,700
We had a small funeral.
It was lovely.

1200
01:16:56,783 --> 01:17:01,288
- Charles is having an affair
with his secretary.
- What?

1201
01:17:01,371 --> 01:17:02,998
Oh, no, no,
darling.

1202
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,502
My Charles,
not your Charles.

1203
01:17:06,543 --> 01:17:10,380
Oh!
I didn't think...

1204
01:17:10,422 --> 01:17:14,009
Everything is all right
with you two, isn't it?

1205
01:17:14,051 --> 01:17:17,471
Oh, absolutely.
We're fine.

1206
01:17:17,554 --> 01:17:20,557
He's just
a little busy.

1207
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:24,853
- Busy?
- "Just have to finish
these reports, dear."

1208
01:17:31,735 --> 01:17:34,154
- Hi.
- Hi.

1209
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:36,698
Whatcha doing?

1210
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:39,493
I gotta get through
these reports.

1211
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:42,204
How much longer?

1212
01:17:42,246 --> 01:17:44,248
Couple of hours.

1213
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:46,416
Oh, Charley!

1214
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,920
I miss you so much.

1215
01:17:50,003 --> 01:17:52,339
I miss you, too, baby.

1216
01:17:54,925 --> 01:17:56,927
How does that feel?

1217
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:00,764
That feels great, baby.

1218
01:18:02,599 --> 01:18:05,227
Do you know
where my hand is?

1219
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:07,354
Not now, okay.
Maybe later.

1220
01:18:07,437 --> 01:18:11,066
Not later, Charley.
Now!

1221
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:13,443
Ow!

1222
01:18:13,527 --> 01:18:16,738
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

1223
01:18:18,282 --> 01:18:20,784
What's the matter
with us?

1224
01:18:20,868 --> 01:18:23,245
What's happening
to us?

1225
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:25,455
Nothing's happening.

1226
01:18:25,539 --> 01:18:28,458
- Exactly. Nothing.
- What are you talking about?

1227
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:31,461
Where's that crazy feeling
you used to have about me?

1228
01:18:31,503 --> 01:18:33,463
Where is it,
Charley?

1229
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:37,092
Oh, come on,
baby.

1230
01:18:43,849 --> 01:18:46,435
- It's gone.
- No, it's not.

1231
01:18:46,476 --> 01:18:48,896
Don't lie.

1232
01:18:48,979 --> 01:18:51,899
Well, a little,
but it'll come back.

1233
01:18:51,982 --> 01:18:54,610
This happens
to everybody.

1234
01:18:54,651 --> 01:18:57,404
Charley, we don't even
touch each other anymore.

1235
01:18:57,487 --> 01:19:00,782
Remember how you used
to love to touch me?

1236
01:19:00,824 --> 01:19:02,826
I still do.

1237
01:19:05,204 --> 01:19:07,581
No, you don't,
Charley.

1238
01:19:07,664 --> 01:19:11,126
We've been here
two years.

1239
01:19:11,168 --> 01:19:15,255
Get us out of here
before it kills us. Please!

1240
01:19:15,339 --> 01:19:19,968
You can't expect me to walk away
from such an important part of my life.

1241
01:19:20,052 --> 01:19:21,970
I did.

1242
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:25,933
The board of directors
is trying to squeeze me out.

1243
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:29,520
I've put everything we own
into the stock options.

1244
01:19:29,603 --> 01:19:32,272
If I leave now,
we'll lose everything.

1245
01:19:32,356 --> 01:19:35,317
If you stay,
you'll lose me.

1246
01:19:36,443 --> 01:19:39,488
I kept my side
of the bargain.

1247
01:19:45,744 --> 01:19:48,372
What's it gonna be,
Charley?

1248
01:20:21,238 --> 01:20:25,367
[Phil] Christmas, 1950,
was not a happy time for Charley Pearl.

1249
01:20:25,409 --> 01:20:27,870
They were divorced
for the second time.

1250
01:20:27,911 --> 01:20:30,038
Somewhere
fate was laughing.

1251
01:20:30,247 --> 01:20:34,334
Then spring arrived
and tragedy struck one of our own.

1252
01:20:34,418 --> 01:20:36,545
Sammy announced
he was getting married.

1253
01:20:36,587 --> 01:20:39,381
So we drove back
to the Pick-A-Daisy Ranch.

1254
01:20:39,423 --> 01:20:41,550
Bugsy Siegel
had been bumped off.

1255
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:45,721
We figured Nevada was now safe.
Even Charley made the trip west.

1256
01:20:45,804 --> 01:20:48,265
- Boy, was he a load oflaughs.
- Somebody cheer Charley up.

1257
01:20:48,348 --> 01:20:51,435
- He's givin' me the creeps.
- Leave the man alone. He's grieving.

1258
01:20:51,518 --> 01:20:54,771
I can't believe
I'm getting married.

1259
01:20:54,855 --> 01:20:57,524
- Why'd you say "yes"?
- I don't know.

1260
01:20:57,608 --> 01:21:00,235
I think she had a hypnotist
over while I was sleeping.

1261
01:21:00,277 --> 01:21:02,571
- What do you think about Adele?
- What?

1262
01:21:02,613 --> 01:21:05,199
She eloped to Mexico
with her chauffeur.

1263
01:21:05,282 --> 01:21:07,409
Lew Horner cut her off
without a cent.

1264
01:21:07,492 --> 01:21:10,078
You are kidding me!

1265
01:21:10,162 --> 01:21:12,915
They say two out of four
marriages ends in divorce.

1266
01:21:12,956 --> 01:21:16,418
The other two are suicides!
But l... Hey!

1267
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:18,712
- I wonder where she is now.
- Adele?

1268
01:21:18,795 --> 01:21:21,423
- In Mexico with the chauffeur.
- No, Vicki!

1269
01:21:21,465 --> 01:21:24,593
- Haven't played that in years!
- I was crazy about that woman.

1270
01:21:24,635 --> 01:21:26,261
- Vicki.
- Right.

1271
01:21:26,303 --> 01:21:29,723
Then one day it stopped.
Just like that. Why?

1272
01:21:29,806 --> 01:21:32,768
Why? Because you're a man, Charley.

1273
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:35,771
And men are crazy,
fucked up sons-of-bitches.

1274
01:21:35,812 --> 01:21:39,983
We want what we can't have, and when
we have it we don't want it anymore.

1275
01:21:40,067 --> 01:21:43,278
- Look at him.
- Look at me, going to a whorehouse...

1276
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,822
so I can get hot for
my wife on our honeymoon...

1277
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:48,825
who I already shtupped
twelve hundred times.

1278
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:50,911
We're all nuts!

1279
01:21:50,994 --> 01:21:52,913
- You're not the first.
- What?

1280
01:21:52,996 --> 01:21:55,791
- Lots of guys shtupped your wife
twelve hundred times.
- I did.

1281
01:21:55,832 --> 01:21:58,085
See? The first person we asked.

1282
01:21:58,168 --> 01:22:00,462
- That is not funny.
- What is not?

1283
01:22:00,504 --> 01:22:03,340
- Hey, slow up. Just slow up.
- What for?

1284
01:22:06,343 --> 01:22:08,804
- Aw, no.
- I don't believe it.

1285
01:22:08,846 --> 01:22:11,640
- Are you serious?
- Do you know...

1286
01:22:11,682 --> 01:22:14,268
what the odds are on this happening?
Predictable.

1287
01:22:14,351 --> 01:22:16,311
- Just one drink.
- No, no.

1288
01:22:16,353 --> 01:22:18,939
Every time we stop for a drink,
you gotta get married.

1289
01:22:19,022 --> 01:22:21,316
I just want to wish her
good luck.

1290
01:22:21,358 --> 01:22:23,527
Tie it on a rock
and throw it through the window.

1291
01:22:27,865 --> 01:22:32,202
D I'm so glad that
I ain't no fool no more d

1292
01:22:35,622 --> 01:22:40,502
d I'm so glad that
I ain't no fool no more d

1293
01:22:40,544 --> 01:22:43,380
God, she still
looks great, huh?

1294
01:22:43,422 --> 01:22:46,216
Oh, well,
I don't mean that great.

1295
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:50,345
She looks good. Nice. Regular.

1296
01:22:50,387 --> 01:22:54,141
D My ma wants me to marry
a multimillionaire d

1297
01:22:54,224 --> 01:22:57,311
dBut I just want somebody
who can handle me with care

1298
01:22:57,394 --> 01:22:59,980
So now you seen her,
don't look anymore.

1299
01:23:00,063 --> 01:23:01,982
Remember that story
in the Bible?

1300
01:23:02,065 --> 01:23:04,193
You're gonna turn
into a box of salt.

1301
01:23:04,234 --> 01:23:06,987
It's a Biblical story.
You can check.

1302
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:09,489
It's over, finito, kaput, huh?

1303
01:23:09,573 --> 01:23:13,327
- Fellas, let's go.
- We didn't order no champagne.

1304
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:17,497
- Compliments of Mr. Denaro.
- Who's Mr. Denaro?

1305
01:23:17,581 --> 01:23:21,001
Number-one man
at the hotel.

1306
01:23:21,084 --> 01:23:24,046
Look at this.
It went from Bugsy to crazy.

1307
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:28,383
Pal, tell Miss Anderson
to join us for a glass of champagne...

1308
01:23:28,425 --> 01:23:30,427
Shh!
After this set is over.

1309
01:23:30,511 --> 01:23:34,181
Miss Anderson doesn't drink
with guests.

1310
01:23:34,264 --> 01:23:37,559
Hey, hey, pal,
this is not a guest.

1311
01:23:37,601 --> 01:23:40,938
This is Charley Pearl.
He was both her husbands.

1312
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:44,608
I'm sorry.
Mr. Denaro's orders.

1313
01:23:44,691 --> 01:23:48,237
She's taken up with Gus!
I should've known...

1314
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:52,741
that these cheap Vegas punks
were always her style.

1315
01:23:52,783 --> 01:23:55,911
Charley, this girl had
a shot at the big leagues...

1316
01:23:55,953 --> 01:23:58,956
- but could not hit the fastball.
- He's not wrong.

1317
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:03,377
D I don't care if you're young
of if you're old d

1318
01:24:05,379 --> 01:24:08,423
- Let's get outta here.
- Smart.

1319
01:24:08,507 --> 01:24:11,468
Her face is gettin'
a little puffy, you notice?

1320
01:24:11,552 --> 01:24:15,597
On my mother's life, I was gonna
say that, but I was afraid to.

1321
01:24:15,639 --> 01:24:20,269
She put on a few pounds in the hips.
You notice the hips?

1322
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:23,272
In two years you couldn't fit
her into a freight elevator.

1323
01:24:23,313 --> 01:24:25,566
I thought she had
sandwiches in her mouth.

1324
01:24:25,649 --> 01:24:28,777
You got rid of her
just in time, Charley.

1325
01:24:28,861 --> 01:24:32,114
- Hey, where's Charley?
- He stopped at the john.

1326
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:34,283
Alone?

1327
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:37,327
- Why didn't you go with him?
- I don't go unless
I gotta do something.

1328
01:24:37,411 --> 01:24:40,664
- What's the matter with you?
- Hey, be careful!

1329
01:24:40,747 --> 01:24:42,749
Bye.

1330
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:49,298
So this is what you
left Boston for?

1331
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:54,178
- I thought you gave me up
for something better than this.
- I like it here, Charley.

1332
01:24:55,512 --> 01:24:58,974
So, how's the
toothpaste business?

1333
01:24:59,016 --> 01:25:02,144
You having fun thinking
up next year's flavors?

1334
01:25:02,227 --> 01:25:04,771
At least that's next year's.
You went back to last year's.

1335
01:25:04,855 --> 01:25:07,691
You like working with Gus
as much as Bugsy?

1336
01:25:07,774 --> 01:25:10,277
Excuse me while I get
my divorce papers to see...

1337
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:13,697
where it says you have the right
to ask me personal questions.

1338
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:16,325
I don't have to be married
to you to be worried.

1339
01:25:18,702 --> 01:25:23,290
- Ten seconds and then I call the boys.
- The boys?

1340
01:25:23,373 --> 01:25:28,170
Oh, that's cute.
What's happening to you?

1341
01:25:28,212 --> 01:25:30,631
Is Gus the one slipping
in your side window...

1342
01:25:30,714 --> 01:25:34,551
or does he still have
a key to the front door?

1343
01:25:35,928 --> 01:25:38,472
Nobody's laid
their hands on me...

1344
01:25:38,555 --> 01:25:42,309
since the day you stopped
laying your hands on me.

1345
01:25:43,268 --> 01:25:46,522
Now get your hands
off me.

1346
01:25:49,066 --> 01:25:52,027
I don't know
how that happened...

1347
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:54,238
but you changed on me.

1348
01:25:55,906 --> 01:25:58,575
And who changed me,
Charley?

1349
01:25:58,659 --> 01:26:00,577
If you wanted Adele...

1350
01:26:00,661 --> 01:26:04,498
why didn't you marry her
in the first place...

1351
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:08,168
- or the second?
- I made a mistake.

1352
01:26:08,252 --> 01:26:10,879
But I gave you enough money
not to have to play...

1353
01:26:10,963 --> 01:26:13,841
a crummy place
like this!

1354
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:23,392
All right, maybe it
is over between you and me.

1355
01:26:23,433 --> 01:26:25,394
Maybe?

1356
01:26:25,435 --> 01:26:27,938
You can go to the casino
and bet on it!

1357
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:31,233
I just don't want you to throw
your life away, understand?

1358
01:26:31,275 --> 01:26:34,403
I've already thrown
away two years...

1359
01:26:34,444 --> 01:26:38,407
giving dinner parties
for 22 dead people.

1360
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:42,411
- You really are a tramp.
- You loved the tramp in me!

1361
01:26:42,452 --> 01:26:47,082
You kissed it good-bye when you made me
raise my pinky holding a teacup.

1362
01:26:47,165 --> 01:26:49,960
You won't make me
ashamed of myself!

1363
01:26:50,043 --> 01:26:52,379
I can't be bought
by you or anybody.!

1364
01:26:57,384 --> 01:26:59,636
I can't believe you did...

1365
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:04,224
What the hell are you doing?
Jesus Christ.! Wait.!

1366
01:27:04,308 --> 01:27:07,769
You wouldn't dare?
Okay, come on.

1367
01:27:07,811 --> 01:27:10,647
Come on.
I dare you.!

1368
01:27:10,731 --> 01:27:12,816
Come on.!

1369
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:16,069
I can't believe
you did that!

1370
01:27:17,321 --> 01:27:19,281
All right, wait.!

1371
01:27:19,364 --> 01:27:22,951
I'm going,
but I'm taking you with me!

1372
01:27:22,993 --> 01:27:26,330
Aaah!
Stop!

1373
01:27:26,413 --> 01:27:28,582
Oh!

1374
01:27:28,665 --> 01:27:31,502
You ripped my dress!

1375
01:27:35,881 --> 01:27:37,466
Owww!

1376
01:27:41,261 --> 01:27:43,972
This is cute,
really cute.

1377
01:27:44,056 --> 01:27:46,141
Ah, ah...

1378
01:27:47,684 --> 01:27:50,437
Why is it you don't
ever seem to listen, huh?

1379
01:27:50,521 --> 01:27:52,648
Didn't you hear
the waiter?

1380
01:27:52,731 --> 01:27:55,359
You need my permission
to see the star.

1381
01:27:55,442 --> 01:27:58,820
Gus, why don't you
go out to the bar...

1382
01:27:58,862 --> 01:28:01,949
and try to
look like Bugsy.

1383
01:28:02,032 --> 01:28:05,536
Once I was nice enough to give you
a warning. I'm not that nice anymore.

1384
01:28:05,619 --> 01:28:07,829
Who's your tailor, Gus?

1385
01:28:07,913 --> 01:28:11,500
This suit looks like the lining
to a better suit.

1386
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:14,044
You're a funny guy.

1387
01:28:15,629 --> 01:28:17,673
Don't, don't!
He's leaving.

1388
01:28:17,714 --> 01:28:19,716
Come on.

1389
01:28:22,261 --> 01:28:26,223
Hey, count to three
before I go, Gus.

1390
01:28:26,306 --> 01:28:29,226
Can you count
that high, Gus?

1391
01:28:32,104 --> 01:28:35,065
- Charley, just shut up.
- You know what I hear, Gus?

1392
01:28:35,107 --> 01:28:38,652
- Keep talkin', playboy.
- I hear you go to the cemetrey...

1393
01:28:38,735 --> 01:28:42,239
and kiss where Bugsy's ass
used to be.

1394
01:28:42,322 --> 01:28:46,159
That's what Vicki told me, Gus.
Ain't that right, honey?

1395
01:28:48,453 --> 01:28:51,999
No, Gus, stop it.!
You're killing him.

1396
01:28:52,082 --> 01:28:55,210
I'm gonna ask one question.
The answer better be "yes."

1397
01:28:55,252 --> 01:28:58,088
You ain't never gonna come
around and bother Vicki.

1398
01:28:58,130 --> 01:29:00,507
- Is that right?
- Yes, yes, he promises.

1399
01:29:00,591 --> 01:29:03,427
Is that right?

1400
01:29:03,468 --> 01:29:06,221
[Vicki]
Yes, yes, yes.

1401
01:29:06,263 --> 01:29:08,348
Oh, I hated doing that.

1402
01:29:14,855 --> 01:29:17,524
You idiot!
You want to get us killed?

1403
01:29:17,608 --> 01:29:20,277
No, I was trying
to get you fired!

1404
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,279
Oh, whoa.!

1405
01:29:23,822 --> 01:29:26,283
Don't you guys ever grab
anywhere else?

1406
01:29:26,325 --> 01:29:29,244
I'll bet he's already
proposed to her.

1407
01:29:29,286 --> 01:29:31,288
Ooo.

1408
01:29:31,371 --> 01:29:33,916
Jesus,
it's a massacre.

1409
01:29:33,999 --> 01:29:37,753
All right, somebody
get Vicki out of here.

1410
01:29:37,836 --> 01:29:39,796
I'll do that.
That'll be my job.

1411
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:44,301
There are four of us
and only one of you.

1412
01:29:46,303 --> 01:29:49,306
I think he likes
the odds, George.

1413
01:29:49,389 --> 01:29:52,809
- They might need you.
- They're much better off without me.

1414
01:29:52,893 --> 01:29:56,605
Believe me when I say that.
This is, uh...

1415
01:29:56,688 --> 01:29:59,650
- [Yelling, Crashing]
- Not my forte.

1416
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:02,152
Oh, my God!

1417
01:30:02,194 --> 01:30:04,154
That's not George.
That's a good sound.

1418
01:30:04,238 --> 01:30:06,615
They're working it out,
is what they are.

1419
01:30:06,657 --> 01:30:09,785
- Sweetheart, come with me.
- Let's get outta here.

1420
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:21,004
Watch the hair!

1421
01:30:21,088 --> 01:30:24,007
You should see what I did
to that big palooka.

1422
01:30:24,049 --> 01:30:26,260
Let's go!

1423
01:30:37,563 --> 01:30:40,148
Thank you.
We had a great ti...

1424
01:30:46,113 --> 01:30:49,783
It's God's curse on me for
wanting to get shtupped again.

1425
01:30:54,371 --> 01:30:57,708
- Can't you pull down a side street?
- It's all desert!

1426
01:30:58,792 --> 01:31:01,503
- Make a right.
- There's no road there!

1427
01:31:01,545 --> 01:31:04,006
Just do it.!

1428
01:31:04,047 --> 01:31:07,676
Vicki, I can't see
a damn thing.!

1429
01:31:07,759 --> 01:31:09,845
This is like
looking for...

1430
01:31:09,887 --> 01:31:12,514
a ballpark in
the minor leagues.

1431
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:17,686
If there's a bus stop,
I'd like to be let out.

1432
01:31:19,396 --> 01:31:21,315
- Make another right.
- Where?

1433
01:31:21,398 --> 01:31:24,651
- Anywhere.
- You can't make a right anywhere.
It has to be somewhere.

1434
01:31:24,735 --> 01:31:26,653
Oh, God.

1435
01:31:28,906 --> 01:31:31,658
What are you doing?

1436
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:36,371
- We got 'em, Gus.
- Shut up.

1437
01:31:36,455 --> 01:31:38,207
[Shouting]

1438
01:31:39,249 --> 01:31:42,336
- Hey, do we got 'em Gus?
- Shut up.

1439
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:05,901
Who got killed?
Them or us?

1440
01:32:05,984 --> 01:32:08,070
Seriously.

1441
01:32:14,952 --> 01:32:19,540
The station doesn't open 'til 7:00.
I got some rooms.

1442
01:32:19,623 --> 01:32:22,042
I'm surprised they took us
without reservations.

1443
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:25,212
This is where werewolves
stop on camping trips.

1444
01:32:25,295 --> 01:32:28,048
They only had two.
Good night.

1445
01:32:28,131 --> 01:32:30,968
- Give me that.
- Five guys in one room?

1446
01:32:31,051 --> 01:32:34,471
In the minor leagues,
the whole team sleeps in one room.

1447
01:32:34,555 --> 01:32:36,765
I get a bed.

1448
01:33:03,667 --> 01:33:05,627
Where were you?

1449
01:33:07,004 --> 01:33:09,756
I'm freezing.
Close the window.

1450
01:33:15,387 --> 01:33:17,472
Oh, Vicki, baby.

1451
01:33:17,556 --> 01:33:20,809
- I missed you so much.
- Stop right there.

1452
01:33:23,729 --> 01:33:28,317
Is it back?
That old feeling...

1453
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:32,446
that you'd go nuts
if you don't get to touch me?

1454
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:35,490
Yeah, it's back.

1455
01:33:35,532 --> 01:33:37,701
We have to talk first.

1456
01:33:37,784 --> 01:33:40,204
Stand over there.

1457
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:47,294
What's changed, Charley?
I still want to be a singer.

1458
01:33:47,377 --> 01:33:50,172
You still want to be
chairman of the board.

1459
01:33:50,214 --> 01:33:52,508
Somebody's got
to give up something.

1460
01:33:53,717 --> 01:33:56,303
I gave up
my stock options.

1461
01:33:56,386 --> 01:33:58,889
I sold my house.

1462
01:33:58,972 --> 01:34:02,518
I left all that
behind.

1463
01:34:04,811 --> 01:34:07,231
I went crazy
without you, baby.

1464
01:34:10,567 --> 01:34:13,987
I took that job
in Vegas...

1465
01:34:14,071 --> 01:34:18,867
'cause I knew it was
the one place that you'd find me.

1466
01:34:18,909 --> 01:34:21,036
I never would've
stopped looking.

1467
01:34:21,078 --> 01:34:24,248
Charley, this is a curse.

1468
01:34:24,331 --> 01:34:27,584
It's okay to love somebody...

1469
01:34:27,668 --> 01:34:32,840
but it's neurotic to think
you can't live without them.

1470
01:34:32,923 --> 01:34:34,883
I read that
in "Reader's Digest."

1471
01:34:34,925 --> 01:34:36,844
I want you back.

1472
01:34:36,927 --> 01:34:39,596
We'll live in L.A.
You can sing, dance, act...

1473
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:42,516
Whatever the hell you want,
so long as we're together.

1474
01:34:42,599 --> 01:34:44,518
Please?

1475
01:34:44,601 --> 01:34:47,187
You won't regret it.

1476
01:34:47,271 --> 01:34:49,523
I promise, Charley.

1477
01:34:49,606 --> 01:34:51,733
Look at you.

1478
01:34:51,817 --> 01:34:54,069
Let's get married
in the morning, baby.

1479
01:34:54,111 --> 01:34:56,196
Ah, shit, Charley!

1480
01:34:56,280 --> 01:35:00,200
- I don't want to get married again.
- We've rehearsed twice.

1481
01:35:00,284 --> 01:35:03,203
We're practically professionals.
What's the problem?

1482
01:35:03,287 --> 01:35:05,789
- Do you, Charles Raymond Pearl...
- I do.

1483
01:35:05,873 --> 01:35:09,459
- Take Victoria to be your
lawfully wedded wife?
- I do.

1484
01:35:09,543 --> 01:35:12,963
Not yet.
For as long as you both shall live?

1485
01:35:13,005 --> 01:35:15,215
- Now.
- I do.

1486
01:35:15,299 --> 01:35:18,385
If the man says, "Can do,"
can do.

1487
01:35:18,468 --> 01:35:20,888
Do you,
Victoria Rosemary Anderson...

1488
01:35:20,971 --> 01:35:22,639
take Charles
to be your husband?

1489
01:35:22,723 --> 01:35:25,309
In sickness and in health?
For better or worse?

1490
01:35:25,392 --> 01:35:29,438
Richer or poorer,
so long as you both shall live?

1491
01:35:35,068 --> 01:35:38,488
I don't think
she's comin' outta the gate.

1492
01:35:38,572 --> 01:35:41,658
The filly's nervous.
Never a winner on this track.

1493
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:46,496
Take your pitch
and swing, baby.

1494
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:48,165
I do.

1495
01:35:48,248 --> 01:35:52,669
With the power vested in me,
I pronounce you man and wife.

1496
01:35:52,753 --> 01:35:55,631
You may kiss
the bride.

1497
01:35:56,590 --> 01:35:59,343
This is the
happiest day of my life.

1498
01:36:01,053 --> 01:36:03,764
I always love these days,
too, Charley.

1499
01:36:03,847 --> 01:36:05,766
I really do.

1500
01:36:05,849 --> 01:36:09,102
Hey, atta boy,
Charley.

1501
01:36:13,857 --> 01:36:16,485
The greatest comeback
in marital history.

1502
01:36:16,568 --> 01:36:18,654
- Good luck, babe.
- Thank you.

1503
01:36:18,737 --> 01:36:21,323
After Sherry and I get married,
we're gonna get divorced.

1504
01:36:21,406 --> 01:36:23,367
- This is so romantic.
- No.

1505
01:36:29,915 --> 01:36:33,168
[Phil] And so the happy newly,
newly, newlyweds...

1506
01:36:33,252 --> 01:36:35,212
drove off into the sunset...

1507
01:36:35,254 --> 01:36:38,674
where, you would imagine,
they lived happily-ever-after.

1508
01:36:38,715 --> 01:36:43,178
Truth? They drove straight to a walnut
grove in Culver City, California.

1509
01:36:43,262 --> 01:36:46,807
See, for the first time in his life,
Charley had plans.

1510
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:49,226
This is it.

1511
01:36:50,644 --> 01:36:53,564
This is what?

1512
01:36:53,605 --> 01:36:56,400
This is ours.
26 acres.

1513
01:36:56,483 --> 01:37:00,195
I bought it. It'll be
finished in nine months.

1514
01:37:00,279 --> 01:37:05,576
- Charley, not another big house.
- Not a house.

1515
01:37:05,659 --> 01:37:09,913
A movie studio.
Pearl Productions.

1516
01:37:09,997 --> 01:37:13,500
I'm gonna make movies
just for you, baby!

1517
01:37:13,584 --> 01:37:15,711
Oh, Charley...

1518
01:37:15,794 --> 01:37:18,881
- what do you know about making movies?
- What's to know?

1519
01:37:18,922 --> 01:37:21,717
You buy a movie camera.
I point the camera at you...

1520
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:24,553
and America falls
in love with you...

1521
01:37:24,595 --> 01:37:27,598
just the way I did.

1522
01:37:27,639 --> 01:37:30,601
[Phil]
Pearl Studios cost 15 million bucks.

1523
01:37:30,684 --> 01:37:33,395
Lucky coincidence.
That's all the money Charley had left.

1524
01:37:33,437 --> 01:37:37,191
Nine months later,
a star was about to be born.

1525
01:37:37,274 --> 01:37:40,277
Except...
it came out a baby.

1526
01:37:42,654 --> 01:37:44,615
Unbelievable.

1527
01:37:47,618 --> 01:37:50,370
But it didn't stop production,
no siree.

1528
01:37:50,454 --> 01:37:53,540
Because with hard work
and perseverance...

1529
01:37:53,624 --> 01:37:56,543
11 months later
they had another baby.

1530
01:37:56,627 --> 01:37:59,129
Finally, Charley found
the right property for Vicki:

1531
01:37:59,213 --> 01:38:01,715
A big-budget
musical extravaganza.

1532
01:38:01,798 --> 01:38:03,759
When Vicki heard the news,
she was so excited...

1533
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,385
she had twins.

1534
01:38:05,469 --> 01:38:08,222
Charley was never happier
in his life.

1535
01:38:08,305 --> 01:38:11,391
He had Vicki,
a family, a home.

1536
01:38:11,475 --> 01:38:14,603
Only he didn't have the studio,
which went bankrupt.

1537
01:38:14,645 --> 01:38:16,772
There's an old saying
in Hollywood...

1538
01:38:16,855 --> 01:38:19,066
"You can't make hits
unless you make pictures. "

1539
01:38:19,149 --> 01:38:22,486
Vicki got back
to her singing...

1540
01:38:22,569 --> 01:38:25,405
this time to support
the family.

1541
01:38:25,489 --> 01:38:28,825
Charley was finding out there were
not a lot ofjob opportunities...

1542
01:38:28,867 --> 01:38:31,954
for ex-millionaire,
playboy, toothpaste kings.

1543
01:38:32,037 --> 01:38:34,289
All the influential people
he had known...

1544
01:38:34,373 --> 01:38:37,501
guys he had picked up
countless tabs for...

1545
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:41,129
now wouldn't give Charley
the time of day.

1546
01:38:41,213 --> 01:38:44,007
[Vicki]
DAfter all the things you told me

1547
01:38:44,091 --> 01:38:49,680
dAnd the promises
that you gave

1548
01:38:49,763 --> 01:38:54,142
As Vicki's star climbed
higher and higher...

1549
01:38:54,184 --> 01:38:57,771
Charley's crashed
and burned.

1550
01:39:00,023 --> 01:39:04,486
1954 found the rest of us
riding the tail of a comet.

1551
01:39:04,570 --> 01:39:07,656
Tony and me were starring
with "La Hayworth."

1552
01:39:07,739 --> 01:39:09,992
Sammy had a hit musical
on Broadway.

1553
01:39:10,075 --> 01:39:13,287
And George had Cincinnati
in second place.

1554
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:16,999
About a year passed,
and another of our brave comrades fell.

1555
01:39:17,082 --> 01:39:20,043
Tony Madden,
now MGM's biggest star...

1556
01:39:20,085 --> 01:39:24,673
was finally caught in that evil spider's
web that traps us all...marriage.

1557
01:39:24,756 --> 01:39:28,135
He not only got the girl,
he bought Lew Horner's house.

1558
01:39:28,218 --> 01:39:31,346
I'm telling ya, irony,
irony everywhere.

1559
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:35,392
I wonder if she knows
it's a toupee.

1560
01:39:35,434 --> 01:39:39,396
- That's not his real hair?
- It is, but when it fell out...

1561
01:39:39,438 --> 01:39:41,690
he had it made
into a toupee.

1562
01:39:41,773 --> 01:39:45,819
- Look at these fool guys.
- That's us seven years ago.

1563
01:39:45,903 --> 01:39:48,363
Do you think they'll
make it as big as we did?

1564
01:39:48,405 --> 01:39:50,407
Nah, we're the last
of our breed.

1565
01:39:50,449 --> 01:39:53,202
Isn't one of your friends
missing, darling?

1566
01:39:53,243 --> 01:39:55,412
Charley Pearl and Vicki.

1567
01:39:55,495 --> 01:39:58,540
- They'll be here. Don't worry.
- I hope nothing's wrong.

1568
01:39:58,624 --> 01:40:01,376
Nah! Probably just stopped
off to have another kid.

1569
01:40:01,418 --> 01:40:06,882
Sorry I couldn't buy you
a new dress for the party.

1570
01:40:06,924 --> 01:40:12,054
Charley, I've only had this
a year and I've worn it twice.

1571
01:40:12,095 --> 01:40:15,224
I never thought a wife of mine
would wear costume jewelery.

1572
01:40:15,307 --> 01:40:18,393
It's not even good
costume jewelery.

1573
01:40:18,435 --> 01:40:22,189
You don't like this bracelet?
I love it!

1574
01:40:22,272 --> 01:40:25,442
Who cares? It looks better
than the real stuff anyway.

1575
01:40:28,278 --> 01:40:30,405
Let's not go.

1576
01:40:30,447 --> 01:40:34,034
It's gonna be boring,
the same jokes, songs...

1577
01:40:34,117 --> 01:40:37,621
the same faces.
I'm sick of these people.

1578
01:40:37,704 --> 01:40:41,625
These guys were more laughs
when they were bums.

1579
01:40:43,335 --> 01:40:46,880
We've missed the
last three parties.

1580
01:40:46,964 --> 01:40:49,883
You've gotta stop hiding
from your friends, Charley.

1581
01:40:49,967 --> 01:40:54,555
- They're your friends.
- I'm not hiding from my friends.

1582
01:40:57,641 --> 01:41:00,227
Okay. Never mind.
Let's go.

1583
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:04,773
Wait, what did you mean,
"hiding from my friends"?

1584
01:41:04,857 --> 01:41:08,735
- Never mind!
- Hey, I want an answer to my question.

1585
01:41:08,819 --> 01:41:11,321
- Just let go of it.
- What did you mean?

1586
01:41:11,405 --> 01:41:15,117
- What did you mean by that?
- It doesn't matter, Charley!

1587
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:22,457
You just...

1588
01:41:22,541 --> 01:41:25,627
you just had a little
run of bad luck.

1589
01:41:25,711 --> 01:41:27,963
"A run of bad luck"?

1590
01:41:28,005 --> 01:41:31,258
I've had a fucking marathon!

1591
01:41:31,341 --> 01:41:34,845
- Why don't you go to
the party by yourself?
- No.

1592
01:41:34,928 --> 01:41:37,514
There'll be a lot
of successful people like you.

1593
01:41:37,598 --> 01:41:40,309
You can compare your reviews
in "Variety,"

1594
01:41:40,350 --> 01:41:44,605
how many times your names
have been in the columns.

1595
01:41:44,688 --> 01:41:46,690
Okay?

1596
01:41:46,773 --> 01:41:49,860
I didn't ask you to build
the studio, Charley.

1597
01:41:49,943 --> 01:41:52,029
I didn't say
"Make me a movie star."

1598
01:41:52,112 --> 01:41:54,531
I just wanted to sing,
that's all!

1599
01:41:54,615 --> 01:41:57,659
- Why didn't you stop me
from making an ass of myself?
- What?

1600
01:41:57,743 --> 01:42:00,495
What the hell did I know
about making movies?

1601
01:42:00,537 --> 01:42:02,831
- Huh?
- I don't believe this.

1602
01:42:02,873 --> 01:42:06,335
- A husband and wife are supposed
to look out for each other, right?
- Yes.

1603
01:42:06,376 --> 01:42:09,505
Why didn't you stop me
from writing all those checks...

1604
01:42:09,588 --> 01:42:13,509
to every creep looking
for a lovesick sucker...

1605
01:42:13,550 --> 01:42:16,720
- which is what I am. Am I right?
- You're not.

1606
01:42:18,138 --> 01:42:21,683
I pulled you out of that place
in Vegas, didn't I?

1607
01:42:21,767 --> 01:42:24,728
You're never gonna let me
forget, are you?

1608
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:28,857
How you pulled me out of Vegas
and made me respectable.

1609
01:42:28,899 --> 01:42:32,361
Then I work my ass off,
gain a little self-respect
while bringing up your kids.

1610
01:42:32,402 --> 01:42:35,239
But you can't take that,
can you, Charley?

1611
01:42:36,573 --> 01:42:40,244
What do you want?
Me to stay at home?

1612
01:42:40,327 --> 01:42:42,663
I can be a wife!
I can be a bimbo!

1613
01:42:42,746 --> 01:42:45,082
It's your choice.
What do you want?

1614
01:42:45,123 --> 01:42:48,877
No, no, no.
I'm the bimbo here.

1615
01:42:48,961 --> 01:42:51,922
I mean,
I'm a kept man.

1616
01:42:51,964 --> 01:42:54,007
- No, Charley.
- Do you know where this party is?

1617
01:42:54,091 --> 01:42:58,095
This is in the house
that Adele Horner lived in...

1618
01:42:58,178 --> 01:43:01,557
- a place where I was treated
like a king once.
- It doesn't matter.

1619
01:43:01,598 --> 01:43:05,060
There are waiters making
more money at this party...

1620
01:43:05,102 --> 01:43:07,521
than I made all
of last year.

1621
01:43:07,604 --> 01:43:10,566
I had my life going exactly
the way I wanted.

1622
01:43:10,649 --> 01:43:13,068
- Shh.
- That's what I gave up for you.

1623
01:43:15,529 --> 01:43:18,031
What did you say,
Charley?

1624
01:43:18,115 --> 01:43:20,284
What you gave up
for me?

1625
01:43:20,367 --> 01:43:23,245
Yeah,
that's right.

1626
01:43:34,506 --> 01:43:37,259
Hey, where you going?

1627
01:43:40,095 --> 01:43:43,140
What you gave up for me,
Charley?

1628
01:43:43,223 --> 01:43:46,101
I don't need you.

1629
01:43:47,644 --> 01:43:50,105
And I never want
to see you again.

1630
01:43:50,147 --> 01:43:52,608
Ever!

1631
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:58,947
You come back here.

1632
01:43:59,031 --> 01:44:02,117
Where do you think
you're going?

1633
01:44:02,201 --> 01:44:05,537
Come back and get in this car.
Do you hear me?

1634
01:44:05,621 --> 01:44:09,791
Come back, goddamn it.
You owe me the rest of your life!

1635
01:44:09,833 --> 01:44:11,877
What about my kids?

1636
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:14,505
I'm not giving up
my kids!

1637
01:44:14,588 --> 01:44:17,799
I don't want my kids to have
a revolving door as a father.

1638
01:44:17,883 --> 01:44:21,678
We have more anniversaries
than we do birthdays!

1639
01:44:21,762 --> 01:44:24,848
I'm a great father.
I love being a father.

1640
01:44:24,932 --> 01:44:28,393
Too bad you don't love
being a husband!

1641
01:44:28,477 --> 01:44:30,729
Look at me, Charley.
Look at me!

1642
01:44:30,812 --> 01:44:34,399
'Cause it's the last chance
you're ever gonna get.

1643
01:44:56,505 --> 01:44:59,424
Goddamn you,
Bugsy Siegel.

1644
01:45:00,801 --> 01:45:03,345
I hope you burn
in hell.

1645
01:45:05,889 --> 01:45:09,017
[Phil]
And they got divorced a third time.

1646
01:45:09,059 --> 01:45:11,854
And Bugsy Siegel
burnt in hell.

1647
01:45:11,937 --> 01:45:14,189
Charley knew
he'd blown it.

1648
01:45:14,231 --> 01:45:16,400
He never made it
to the party.

1649
01:45:16,483 --> 01:45:20,696
In fact, as 1955 became 1956...

1650
01:45:20,779 --> 01:45:24,449
none of us heard from or even about...
Charley Pearl.

1651
01:45:24,533 --> 01:45:27,911
Vicki packed the kids in her van
and moved up to San Francisco.

1652
01:45:27,953 --> 01:45:32,249
I never told you?
That's where me and the guys found her.

1653
01:45:32,332 --> 01:45:36,879
D What good is money if
your heart isn't light d

1654
01:45:39,006 --> 01:45:42,551
She's singing with more...
heart.

1655
01:45:42,634 --> 01:45:44,720
Know what I mean?

1656
01:45:44,803 --> 01:45:47,389
Yeah. It's called loneliness.

1657
01:45:47,431 --> 01:45:50,559
D When youth
has its fling d

1658
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:56,231
- Jesus, I don't believe it.
- What?

1659
01:45:56,273 --> 01:46:00,819
- Charley. It's Charley.
- Holy Moses!

1660
01:46:02,529 --> 01:46:06,909
- You know what the odds
are on this happening?
- Even money.

1661
01:46:10,037 --> 01:46:16,960
D We have the right
to laugh at them all

1662
01:46:17,002 --> 01:46:19,546
Come on.
Let's go.

1663
01:46:19,630 --> 01:46:22,132
DLove is still king

1664
01:46:22,216 --> 01:46:28,263
dLove is the thing

1665
01:46:28,347 --> 01:46:30,807
Charley.

1666
01:46:32,976 --> 01:46:35,395
- Charley, it's us.
- It's Tony.

1667
01:46:39,816 --> 01:46:41,818
Hey, fellas.

1668
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:44,988
It's nice
to see you.

1669
01:46:48,909 --> 01:46:50,953
Where you been,
Charley?

1670
01:46:50,994 --> 01:46:52,621
I've been around.

1671
01:46:52,704 --> 01:46:54,665
- Around where?
- What've you been doing?

1672
01:46:54,706 --> 01:46:58,293
I got into this new business
they got up here.

1673
01:46:58,335 --> 01:47:00,462
What business?

1674
01:47:00,504 --> 01:47:03,465
- They're called computers.
- Schmuck.

1675
01:47:03,507 --> 01:47:06,301
Shh.

1676
01:47:06,385 --> 01:47:08,846
Hey, does Vicki
know you're here?

1677
01:47:08,929 --> 01:47:12,641
Yeah, I come in three,
four times a week.

1678
01:47:12,683 --> 01:47:15,686
You two...
you're not... together?

1679
01:47:15,727 --> 01:47:18,313
No, no.

1680
01:47:18,355 --> 01:47:22,317
She's a tough nut to crack,
you know.

1681
01:47:22,401 --> 01:47:25,863
Dlf we're rich
or we're poor

1682
01:47:27,531 --> 01:47:29,658
Are you okay,
Charley?

1683
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:32,452

1684
01:47:32,536 --> 01:47:35,372

1685
01:47:35,414 --> 01:47:37,666
Me?

1686
01:47:37,749 --> 01:47:41,170
Drinkin'?
You know I don't drink.

1687
01:47:41,211 --> 01:47:42,713
Hey, fellas.

1688
01:47:42,796 --> 01:47:45,674
I wanna show you
something.

1689
01:47:45,716 --> 01:47:48,135
Look at that.

1690
01:47:48,218 --> 01:47:50,012
Beauties, huh?

1691
01:47:50,095 --> 01:47:53,182
They all look
like their mom.

1692
01:47:53,265 --> 01:47:59,855
D And here in your arms d

1693
01:47:59,897 --> 01:48:03,317
Let me ask you fellas
a question.

1694
01:48:07,571 --> 01:48:10,199
You think
she'll like this?

1695
01:48:13,911 --> 01:48:16,371
It's a dazzler,
Charley.

1696
01:48:16,413 --> 01:48:19,708
What's the occasion?

1697
01:48:19,791 --> 01:48:23,879
I'm gonna pop the question.
What do you think?

1698
01:48:23,921 --> 01:48:27,216
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

1699
01:48:27,257 --> 01:48:30,177
Charley,
answer me something.

1700
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:34,431
Why do you want to marry
the same woman four times?

1701
01:48:40,604 --> 01:48:43,232
It fits.

[Phil] And they never
got divorced again.

1730
01:51:58,468 --> 01:52:01,305
Vicki kept on singing
her heart out.

1731
01:52:01,388 --> 01:52:04,474
And curiously enough, Charley's
hunch about that computer thing...

1732
01:52:04,558 --> 01:52:07,102
actually paid off.
Yeah.

1733
01:52:07,186 --> 01:52:09,938
He now owns a small county
in northern California.

1734
01:52:10,022 --> 01:52:13,817
Well, they needed a big yard
for all those kids.

1735
01:52:13,901 --> 01:52:16,653
Like Charley says,
there are couples in love...

1736
01:52:16,737 --> 01:52:18,572
and there are couples
who are hot.

1737
01:52:18,655 --> 01:52:20,574
And then
there's him and Vicki.

1738
01:52:20,657 --> 01:52:22,659
They got both.

1739
01:52:22,743 --> 01:52:24,828
You know what
the odds are on that?

1740
01:52:24,912 --> 01:52:27,456
Big... very big...

1741
01:52:27,539 --> 01:52:29,917
extremely very big.
