have a good time,

are you studying this?

36
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,670

happened at the house.

-I really don't know.

was a lot of blood.

-No, I'm an art historian.

be down in a few moments.

-Thank you.

-If I could take your bag, sir.

72
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,146

-Margaret.

00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,592
-What happened?

78
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,593
-He's upstairs.

79
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:41,594
-How is he?

80
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,495
-Terrible.

81
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,730
He's unconscious.

82
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,332
-Have you call the doctor?

83
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,267
-He's with him now.

84
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,602
Father was alone in his study.

85
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,438
I heard a scream.

86
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:52,372
I walked in to the room.

87
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,607
His arm was all torn up.

88
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,775
There was blood everywhere.

89
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:02,982
-Ah, Margaret, I
just about finished.

90
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,318
Seems to have lost a
great deal of blood.

91
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,254
I think he could do
with a couple of units.

92
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,558
And I do have some
of his own plasma.

93
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,760
-Why don't you take
him to a hospital?

94
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,862
-No, my father hates hospitals.

95
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,032
-I don't think I've ever
seen a coma quite like this.

-How do you know no one
came from the balcony?

102
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:39,486
-Or I should say no one forced
their way through those doors.

103
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:44,257
I've seen enough forced doors
in my time at the Yard to know.

104
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,191
Came in through this door.

105
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,198
Unless he did it to himself.

106
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,267
-I think we can rule that out.

107
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,036
He has too much
respect for life.

108
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,038
-Well, there it is.

109
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,608
And where were you again
when this happened?

110
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,109
-I was in my dark room.

111

I hadn't seen my father all day.

112
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:05,912
-No?

113
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,814
The housekeeper
Mrs. Grant said she

114
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,350
heard Mr.Trelawny
talking to you.

115
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,118
Called you by name.

116
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,920
-She must be mistaken.

117
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,955
-Maybe he was dictating.

118
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:20,026
-Uh, Mr. Wyatt, if
you please, could

119
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,928
you give us a moment alone?

120
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,597
-I want him to stay.

121
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,698
I've asked him to be here.

122
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,174

you must follow

my directions to the letter.

127

If I'm not already in my
study, I am to be taken there.

128

Once there, you I
must never be left

00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,469

Day and night, at
least two persons

131
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,907
must remain in the room.

132
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,744
And none of the Egyptian
artifacts can be moved.

133
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:16,015
There's a special purpose in
the placing of each piece.

134
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:21,688
Also, the small key
must remain on my wrist.

what this key opens?

has his reasons

I hear there are a
lot of clubs there.

-Yeah, a lot of clubs.

162
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:32,352
-Do you think you could--
I mean, if there were

163
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:35,622
some clubs where
you could get me in.

-Little lonely for
you in this house?

-Gives me the jitters.

166
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:43,796
Sounds a bit odd, but the
house has its own personality.

167
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:48,434
It makes strange noises,
especially that study.

168

Late one night, the
door was open a crack,

169

the lights began
to dim, and I heard

170
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,175
a banging coming
from behind the door.

171
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,579
I knew Mr. Trelawny was
already asleep in his bedroom,

172

close your window

181
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:27,707
-Horses.

182
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,676
-There are no horses anymore.

183
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,745
Mr. Trelawny gave them
away a few months back.

184
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,048
-Hmm

185
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,950
-Oh, um, can we get the
heat turned up a bit?

186
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,852
I'll get you a space heater
from the basement, sir.

187
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:40,653
-Thanks.

188
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,328
[angry cat meow]

189
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,657
-Can you believe this rot?

190
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:18,791
Can't be moved.

191
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,992
Two people watching him.

192
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,694
I mean, why is
this being treated

193
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,198
like some sort of
a mystic thing?

194
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,866
-I don't know.

195
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:31,771
-You and Margaret
seem quite familiar.

196
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,474
Wonder why I've never
heard your name before.

197
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:38,444
-(SIGHING) We, uh, barely
got to know each other

198
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:42,348
before we had a
little falling out.

199
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,650
You know hot it is.

200
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,786
Listen, have you talked
to the driver yet?

201
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,020
-Jimmy?

202
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,956
-Yeah, I saw him
with a silver flask.

203
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,191
I think it belonged
to Mr. Trelawny.

204
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,526
-Hmm.

205
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,361
I spoke with him briefly.

206
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,229
But he's still on my list.

207
00:14:58,531 --> 00:14:59,799
-Robert?

208
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,035
Would you mind taking the
late shift with my father?

209
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,638
We're tired, and I
remember you get up late.

210
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,439
-Yeah.

211
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,041
Fuck.

212
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,984
-(FROM UPSTAIRS) Lily,
where did you go off to?

213
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,452
-Mum, I'm just down
in the basement

214
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,455
getting a space
heater for Mr. Wyatt.

215
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:37,997
What's that?

216
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,233
I'm not cleaning that mess up.

217
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,877
-[laughing]

218
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,347
[phone ringing]

219
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,886
-What?

220
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,422
Robert, do you have any
idea what time it is?

221
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,357
-Yeah, it's after midnight.

222
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,226
I knew you wouldn't be
doing anything important.

223
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,329
-Yeah, and I was having a
damn good time doing it.

224
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,064
ROBERT (ON THE PHONE):
Listen, I got something here.

225
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,533
It's a small hand
rake, except it's

226
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,169
shaped like a snake with fangs.

227
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:50,970
-Uh.

228
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,939
How many?

229
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,640
-Uh, seven.

230
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,943
-RICHARD: Oh, boy.

231
00:17:56,943 --> 00:18:02,381
Yeah, you know, that sounds
like a mouth-opening staff

232
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,349
used during mummification.

233
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,217
One hundred grand, easy.

234
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,886
-That explains why it's
bashed in the head,

235
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,388
but not why someone's
digging in the dirt with it.

236
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,389
-No, don't go yet.

237
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,724
-I should be going anyway.

238
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,260
-Robert, can we talk
about this in the morning?

239
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,797
-Yeah, one more thing,
stone tablet in two pieces,

240
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:21,334
one big symbol, a man
with a dog's head.

241
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:25,204
-Nibba, whoa, master
of the mysteries.

242
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:29,442
It's very important for
mummification and resurrection.

243
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,477
Boy, I just hope none of that
stuff is stolen, you know,

244
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,511
the curse.

245
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,879
-Don't give me that
King Tut bullshit.

246
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,247
-No.

247
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:39,885
Although, I'll tell you, years
ago workers on the Aswan Dam

248
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,888
stumbled upon an undiscovered
tomb full of treasure.

249
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:46,892
Two diggers took sapphire eyes
out of a Pharaoh's statue.

250
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,228
The next day, they were
found burnt to a crisp.

251
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,097
-C'mon, you don't believe that.

252
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,933
-Well, I don't, but my old
professor does, though.

253
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,003
And get this, he lost
an eye that same night

254
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,537
in a freak accident.

255
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,805
Yeah.

256
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,474
Girls love that story, yeah.

257
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,743
It scares the hell out of them.

258
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:07,680
I'm, I'm, I'm almost-- Oh, man.

259
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,848
ROBERT (ON PHONE):
Gotta go, Brice.

260
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,291
-Changing of the guard.

261
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,761
-It's about time.

262
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:25,564
It's a ridiculous exercise,
two people when one will do.

263
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,699
-Hi, I am Robert.

264
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,566
-Hello.

265
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,567
-Oh, yes.

266
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,169
Mrs. Grant was out
when you arrived.

267
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,404
You were at church, wasn't it?

268
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:32,838
Confessing you said?

269
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,908
-I said I was praying
for Mr. Trelawny.

270
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:39,378
-Yes, well, I'm off to the city.

271
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,246
I'll be back tomorrow.

272
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,484
-He's right.

273
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,786
I can take care of him myself.

274
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,387
-Oh, that's OK.

275
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,891
I promised Margaret I'd do it.

276
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:52,992
What is that smell?

277
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:56,796
I keep getting a strong
whiff of a pungent--

278
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,899
-Oh, the rich aroma
of ancient Egypt.

279
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,834
It's these artifacts.

280
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,335
They reek of it.

281
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,838
I can't imagine it's
good for Mr. Trelawny.

282
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:29,522
-No!

283
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:32,158
Margaret!

284
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:32,992
-What have you got there?

285
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,847
-So, have you worked for
Mr. Trelawny very long?

286
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,282
-Going on 30 years.

287
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,121
Do you believe what that
pompous ass implied?

288
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:04,323
Doesn't know the difference
between confession

289
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,793
and saying the rosary.

290
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,163
This man means the
world to me, and he

291
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,200
should be in hospital right now.

292
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,301
-Is there something I should do?

293
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:19,171
Should I go get the doctor?

294
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:23,108
-He seems all right now.

295
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:26,979
But that's the third time he's
done that since I've been here.

296
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:30,983
I'm going to insist very
strenuously that he be moved.

297
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,084
-I'm gonna go get
some fresh air.

298
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,231
-Hutchins?

299
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,032
-Yes, Miss.

300
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,668
-Where are you going?

301
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,770
-We're leaving, Miss.

302
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,507
I told Gwen, after what's just
happned to her, I think she

303
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:36,875
and Lily should leave, too.

304
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,612
Strange things have happened
here over the last few years.

305
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:43,449
This was just too much.

306
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:48,320
-Mrs. Grant told me that you're
a very superstitious man.

307
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,922
But my father needs you now.

308
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:53,892
Please, don't go.

309
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,334
-Keeping the police
from getting involved

310
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,571
is becoming
increasingly difficult.

311
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:10,009
Someone is obviously
trying to kill your father.

312
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:14,446
-And Mrs. Grant obviously
gone in their way.

313
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,715
-Have there been any
strange by, unusual

314
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,884
phone calls, so on and so forth?

315
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,652
-Not that I remember.

316
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,454
-What about the
prints from the study?

317
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,722
-Keene is processing them.

318
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,758
-There was someone
he was expecting,

319
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,226
but he never showed up.

320
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,527
-Someone?

321
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,830
-He was very upset, and
then a package came,

322
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,898
and he was calm again.

323
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,000
-A name?

324
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,868
-What was his name?

325
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:40,105
It was Cor-- Corbin--

326
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:40,939
-Corbeck?

327
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:41,740
-That's it.

328
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,242
John Corbeck.

329
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:47,146
-A dreadful man, a liar,
a thief, a grave robber.

330
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:49,348
-C'mon, tell us what
you really think.

331
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,517
-You listen to me.

332
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:54,286
I know about him from
my days at the Yard.

333
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,188
Let's just say we're
fortunate this man

334
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,756
has not set foot in this house.

335
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:07,366
-Seems like you hit a nerve.

336
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,034
-I need a break.

337
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:09,835
And a kiss.

338
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,755
[snoring]

339
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,056
-J. Corbeck.

340
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,931
-That tape was fantastic.

341
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,200
Do you really think any
of that stuff was stolen?

342
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,101
-Man, I hope not.

343
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,739
-OK.

344
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:25,477
OK, from 1967, it seems
everything in Trelawny's study

345
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:30,349
is from this tomb, the tomb
of Queen Tera, very powerful

346
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,951
5,000 years ago.

347
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,020
OK, it's a;; been
recorded in the expedition

348
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,390
logs, but none of it
has been seen since.

349
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,759
I was actually at this
tomb myself 10 years ago.

350
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,761
Some of the items haven't
even been touched.

351
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,096
-Why not?

352
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:48,000
-Well, you know, Queen Tera
was killed by her priests,

353
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,269
because of her popularity
with the masses.

354
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:52,938
Her dying breath was a
curse for touching anything.

355
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:55,007
I mean, you're cursed even
if you talk about what you've

356
00:27:55,007 --> 00:28:00,946
seen, which I never
have, until now.

357
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,715
-Brice, you really believe
these curses, don't you?

358
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,851
-Nah, when you get down to it,
curses aren't that interesting.

359
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,355
-Wyatt.

360
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,958
-I'll print off hard
copies of this stuff.

361
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:15,727
-Yeah.

362
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,663
OK, look, you gotta
move faster for me.

363
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,872
-Hold on a sec.

364
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:27,673
Please.

365
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:34,246
OK, what are you saying?

366
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:36,148
You don't have a number for him?

367
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,516
All right, look, I gotta go.

368
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:43,355
Brice!

369
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:46,391
OK, this is a hell of a curse.

370
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,628
-Girls get a big
kick when I do that.

371
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:50,395
OK.

372
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:14,553
-Yes?

373
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:17,222
-Hello, I'm looking
for John Corbeck.

374
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,557
Does he live here?

375
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,825
-No.

376
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:22,294
-But he did live
here, didn't he?

377
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,095
-No.

378
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:27,966
-Can I see that?

379
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,874
His favorite cigars.

380
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,378
-I'm Robert Wyatt, I'm a
friend of Abel Trelawny's.

381
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:40,512
-Trelawny.

382
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,381
John hasn't been
here in a while.

383
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:43,882
-Well, do you know
where he is now?

384
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,717
It's important.

385
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:51,223
-John did live here on and
off, um, for a few years.

386
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:53,258
But he left suddenly.

387
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,661
-Why?

388
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,129
-I don't know.

389
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,599
-Do you know what his business
was with Mr. Trelawny?

390
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,400
-No.

391
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:09,074
He sent me-- he
sent me an old lamp,

392
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:12,377
and he said it was important I
take it to Trelawny personally,

393
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:16,114
that it competed a set.

394
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,818
And when John got back
from his last trip,

395
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,221
he was consumed with
finishing an assignment.

396
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:26,925
He sat outside a
lot, after dark.

397
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,929
He said he was
studying the night sky.

398
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:36,168
And with every day that went
past, he grew more distant.

399
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:39,604
Look, if you are a friend,
maybe you can help him.

400
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,047
-What's this?

401
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,348
-He's been there about a month.

402
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:57,456
If you do see him, be careful.

403
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,624
He's strong, and
he can be violent.

404
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:09,701
-Ah.

405
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:14,539
Here's-- the journals
of Abel Trelawny.

406
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:19,845
Yeah, should pay
for my retirement.

407
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:21,313
-[bumping]

408
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,518
-Playground down here.

409
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:35,193
"Today is the saddest
day of my life.

410
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,263
I had to send Margaret away.

411
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:40,966
I will not have her involved.

412
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:45,170
I cried when I saw her go.

413
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,638
I will cry every day.

414
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,011
Yep, that's the start of it.

415
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,579
And that's the end.

416
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:00,685
-[growling]

417
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,888
-Silvia?

418
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:03,655
Is that you?

419
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,061
Come back to say
goodbye, did you?

420
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:55,640
-John Corbeck?

421
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,209
My name is Robert Wyatt.

422
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,778
-I'm not interested, son.

423
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:00,712
-I'm here for Abel Trelawny.

424
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:10,355
-And I'm here because
of Abel Trelawny.

425
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,924
-What do you mean?

426
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,759
-Enough.

427
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:18,096
-Look, Margaret said you were
supposed to come to the house.

428
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,998
-Margaret is at the house?

429
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,735
-Yeah, for about six weeks now.

430
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:24,536
-Done.

431
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:25,503
I'm done.

432
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,838
Enough.

433
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,907
-Look, you sent a package he
was waiting for, didn't you?

434
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:32,043
-I sent many packages to Abel
Trelawny through the years.

435
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,813
-Look, something's
happened at the house.

436
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,414
-Something has happened to me.

437
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:37,616
-Yeah, what did
happen to you anyway?

438
00:33:48,093 --> 00:34:02,807
-All right, I had just returned
from one of my many expeditions

439
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:06,244
finding artifacts
for Abel Trelawny.

440
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:10,715
And I had to arrange the
artifacts around the floor

441
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:16,321
to examine them,
when suddenly I got

442
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:17,789
the acute sense
of being watched.

443
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:24,462
I grew hot and weak.

444
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:25,864
My vision was blurred.

445
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:30,368
It's not the normal situation
when I drink, I assure you.

446
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,772
The lights went out.

447
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:37,809
And all of a sudden
in the air a sort of

448
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:44,382
must of ancient
tombs and a colors.

449
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:50,922
The senses-- sacred
the hell out of me.

450
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,528
I haven't been that
scared since I was a boy.

451
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:05,770
I found myself standing up on
a ledge to a window stark naked

452
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:10,508
with nothing but a headdress,
screaming, "My God help me.

453
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,776
God help me."

454
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,844
And I don't even believe in God.

455
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,352
Someone called the
police, as if it

456
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:21,953
was unusual behavior
for San Francisco.

457
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:30,762
Well, you go back
and tell him that.

458
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:31,796
-Abel's in a coma.

459
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,065
-What?

460
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:35,967
-He was attacked, and we
don't know who did it.

461
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,169
-Is there any marks on him,
on his wrists, on his neck,

462
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,839
like seven scratches
side-by-side?

463
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,574
-How did you know that?

464
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:44,409
-You must take me to the house.

465
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:47,512
Everyone in the house is in
danger, especially Margaret.

466
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:48,913
-Well, I can't.

467
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,950
-Look I know how to stop it.

468
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,586
We must complete the
task that it asks for us,

469
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,788
but I must be there.

470
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,857
-There's the little
matter of this door.

471
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,859
Someone feels that
you should stay here.

472
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:04,062
-It is not that they
think that I'm crazy.

473
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:07,265
It is that I think
that I'm crazy.

474
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:09,934
Now, will you take me there?

475
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,102
-I want you to find
out all you can

476
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,905
about the latest
whereabouts of John Corbeck.

477
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,940
There's a file in my
office, start with that.

478
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,010
And don't come here
anymore, don't call me.

479
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,311
I'll contact you.

480
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,047
The reason I put you on this
case in the first place--

481
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,549
-(JAMAICAN ACCENT): Is
because I am the best.

482
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,551
And where will you be staying?

483
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,454
-Here, for the time
being at least.

484
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,389
-You can have this house.

485
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,458
It has the same feeling
as the woods back home.

486
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,559
It gives me them creeps.

487
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,731
Well, I'm out of here.

488
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:46,204
-It really does have some
extraordinary pieces here,

489
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,605
doesn't he?

490
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:48,740
-I suppose so.

491
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,909
I prefer the Impressionists.

492
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,478
-Really?

493
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:56,548
You've been estranged from your
father for quite some time,

494
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:57,916
haven't you?

495
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:02,287
Sent away to school at seven,
lived in Switzerland, France,

496
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:04,956
and here in the United States.

497
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,958
-That's right.

498
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:10,595
-Really haven't had much of a
relationship for, what is it,

499
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,263
two decades?

500
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:15,133
And suddenly you develop this
keen interest to visit him.

501
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:17,469
-I've been trying to
come here for years.

502
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,370
My father has always
turned me down.

503
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,339
-Really?

504
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,707
Yet, here you are.

505
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,309
-One day I showed up
at the front gate,

506
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:26,277
uninvited and unannounced.

507
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:29,347
I was drawn here
for some reason.

508
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,582
I knew it was time to be home.

509
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,320
Have you found anything new?

510
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,388
-We're still checking
a few things.

511
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,857
-Such as?

512
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:41,926
-What exactly was your
location during the attack

513
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,695
on Mrs. Grant?

514
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,163
-I was in my room.

515
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:46,765
-Mr. Wyatt says you
were the first person

516
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,666
to enter the study.

517
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,168
-And?

518
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:52,036
-He said he could only see
shadows through the curtains.

519
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,672
He couldn't make
out the attacker.

520
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,308
It's odd that both your
father and Mrs. Grant

521
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,409
seem to have had
their worst luck

522
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,078
when you were nearest to them.

523
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,580
-Where was I when Mrs.
Grant was attacked?

524
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,982
Your father seem
to have his worse

525
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:05,717
luck when you're nearest to him?

526
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:08,486
-I'm conducting an
investigation, no more.

527
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:09,888
It's my job.

528
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:11,289
-Not anymore

529
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,423
-I work for your
father, not you.

530
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,693
If that's a problem for
you, well, there it is.

531
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,495
I should've have thought
you'd want me to be thorough.

532
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:26,437
-Find whoever did
this to him, Mr. Daw.

533
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,339
-I certainly will
do just that, Miss.

534
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,129
ABEL TRELAWNY
(VOICEOVER): School

535
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:54,866
in Paris will be
best for you now.

536
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,634
It's only a few hours away.

537
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,303
-Daddy, don't send me away.

538
00:38:58,303 --> 00:39:00,138
I need you.

539
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:04,108
-ABEL TRELAWNY: Oh, my
darling, it'll be best for you.

540
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:12,617
-Margaret, I think
you should see this.

541
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:15,987
There's snaps of your mother.

542
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:17,622
-I don't understand.

543
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:18,790
Father said all
the pictures of her

544
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,525
were burned during the fire.

545
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,326
-Not these.

546
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:28,866
-She was so pretty.

547
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,938
-I'll let you look
at them by yourself.

548
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:06,404
-All right now, let's see what
you've been up to, Mr. Corbeck.

549
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:10,308
I can do astrology,
alignment of the stars,

550
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:15,847
um-- That's tomorrow night.

551
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:18,549
Daw's gonna love this.

552
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:21,686
Gonna throw me a party
at the Trelawny estate.

553
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:29,827
Dancing girls, beautiful
women, in Jamaican--

554
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:58,423
Just paid the bill--
What do you want!

555
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:07,332
It's true.

556
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:24,649
-Margaret.

557
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,721
-John Corbeck?

558
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:32,824
-I've often wondered
how you'd look.

559
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,192
And how you would speak.

560
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,893
-You had business
with my father?

561
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,229
-Much more personal than that.

562
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,331
Is he in the study?

563
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,433
-What exactly was it?

564
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,235
-I must see him now.

565
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,337
-Mr. Corbeck, my father
is seriously ill,

566
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,940
and I know nothing about you.

567
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,274
-That could be a blessing.

568
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:57,181
I, however, know a
great deal about you.

569
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,284
Your father and I, we
go back a long way.

570
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:03,354
This bracelet he
found at a previously

571
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:08,493
undisturbed grave
site near Tiba, 1961.

572
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:15,466
This sculpture here,
Giza, 1966, I believe.

573
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:18,703
We had a deuce of a
time trying to convince

574
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:22,273
the locals to let
us near that site.

575
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,143
Your father was so excited
he fell off a steep hill.

576
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:28,946
Damn near broke his neck.

577
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:36,220
But it was on the next
expedition that matters most.

578
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,991
You were born on that
dig, as far as I remember.

579
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:43,261
I know what's wrong
with your father.

580
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:44,362
-The doctor thinks--

581
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,764
-Uh-uh, doctors cannot help him.

582
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:49,734
I must see him alone.

583
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,769
-He said there are to be two
people in the room with him

584
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,004
at all times.

585
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:54,872
-Oh, there will be.

586
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,941
Your father still
counts, doesn't he?

587
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:09,087
You old fool, translated
it, didn't you?

588
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:30,374
(GROANING)

589
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,677
-These are the
instructions to the dead.

590
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:35,847
We've got to find
the other half.

591
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:43,054
-(EGYPTIAN SPEAKING)

592
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:45,523
-He says it won't be here.

593
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:48,025
This tablet was broken
for a good reason.

594
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,495
And the other half was sent
to the end of the Earth.

595
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:55,466
Look!

596
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:03,875
The gods will not
come at any summons.

597
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:10,815
The nameless one has insulted
them, and is forever alone.

598
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:11,816
Do not enter or--

599
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,287
-Or what?

600
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:21,492
-Their vengeance
will wither you away.

601
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:41,946
--Don't worry.

602
00:44:41,946 --> 00:44:42,747
Don't worry.

603
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:03,901
-I've been here before, but I
thought it was just a dream.

604
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:07,738
Or a nightmare.

605
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,511
A nightmare still have.

606
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:18,950
-Hey, come here.

607
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,654
-Queen of the Egypts.

608
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,657
Daughter of Antiff.

609
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:30,361
Monarch of the North and South.

610
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:32,897
Daughter of the sun.

611
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:33,731
Tera.

612
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:34,532
-John, over here.

613
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:41,839
This is it.

614
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:42,640
C'mon.

615
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:54,252
The jewel, it is Queen Tera.

616
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,219
Pack it up.

617
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:58,122
Pack everything.

618
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:00,057
-Look at her hand.

619
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:03,060
Do you really think we
can get out of here alive,

620
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,897
or without being thrown
in chains for eternity?

621
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:09,900
-I think we are one
step closer to finding

622
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,435
out what eternity really is.

623
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:15,139
Pack it up.

624
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:29,086
-We both agreed
that we wouldn't try

625
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:30,154
it unless we were here together.

626
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:41,299
Well, I'm here now.

627
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:52,777
On that last
expedition with Abel,

628
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:55,946
we traveled to the Valley of
the Sorcerer, which is where we

629
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:58,182
discovered the tomb for the
most powerful woman in all

630
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:03,587
of Egypt, Queen Tera herself.

631
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:04,655
-She was too powerful.

632
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,923
The priests were going
to have her killed

633
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,792
because she was usurping
their authority.

634
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:08,926
-Well, that is the
official story.

635
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,328
The truth is somewhat different.

636
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:13,564
She heard of the plot, and she
came up with an intricate plan.

637
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:17,001
She would have
herself mummified.

638
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,669
-Weren't all royalty
mummified back then?

639
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:22,406
-Yes, but she had her own
doctors and her own tomb.

640
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:24,041
That, and along with
other incantations

641
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,911
and other white magic,
she said that she

642
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:29,513
would one day soon return.

643
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,115
And she always
kept her promises.

644
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,687
-Wonderful, Corbeck.

645
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,557
A simply wonderful
performance from a very

646
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:42,927
accomplished conman.

647
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:43,728
Sargent

648
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:45,329
-Still smuggling, are you?

649
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,598
Or have you moved up to
out-and-out theft of private--

650
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:50,201
Sargent John is a
guest in this house.

651
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,436
-That's all right, Margaret.

652
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,205
Sargent Daw and I
go back a few years.

653
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,574
We have a every
equitable relationship.

654
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:58,909
He hates me.

655
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,011
And I have other things
to do rather than think

656
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:04,081
of him, like saving Abel's life.

657
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:23,734
I knew her very well.

658
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,937
Your father loved her very much.

659
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:28,939
-Then why did he leave her
alone when she was pregnant?

660
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:31,876
-He didn't want to
go, but she insisted.

661
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:33,544
-What was so important
about this expedition

662
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:36,447
that it couldn't wait?

663
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:39,316
-We had found Queen Tera's tomb.

664
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:47,725
As far as we could tell, when we
opened the tomb, you were born.

665
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:51,462
Two days later, we heard
of your mother's death.

666
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:53,564
Abel was never the same.

667
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:56,367
Never spoke to
anyone for a year.

668
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,869
Couldn't work.

669
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:01,705
He hated it, but he
had to send you away.

670
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,874
-I thought just wasn't
important to him.

671
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,876
-Oh, far from it.

672
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:07,244
We talked for many hours.

673
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,246
He kept tabs on you.

674
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:10,681
He was very, very proud.

675
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:15,085
You have your mother's heart.

676
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:24,128
The sarcophagus in the study,
she's inside, Queen Tera.

677
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:51,622
-Margaret, hey, I saw
Corbeck reading this.

678
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:52,823
It's amazing.

679
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,191
It's all here.

680
00:49:54,191 --> 00:50:00,464
There's, um, Queen
Tera, Valium Sorcerer.

681
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:03,200
-Where's the special jewel?

682
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,468
I don't think he's
telling the truth.

683
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,731
MARGARET: Make love to me.

684
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:53,183
[thunder]

685
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:54,084
BRICE (WHISPERING): Robert.

686
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:56,654
-Brice?

687
00:50:56,654 --> 00:51:00,257
What the hell you doing here?

688
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:02,159
-You're not going
to believe this.

689
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:02,960
Whoa.

690
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,994
A sudden Egyptian interest?

691
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:05,229
Not bad.

692
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,197
-Hey, hey, hey, Brice, what
the hell you doing here?

693
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:08,632
-I came to warn you.

694
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:09,433
Boy, you aren't kidding.

695
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,335
This place is great.

696
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:13,003
-Hey, c'mon, warn me about what?

697
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:16,006
-Ok, I talked to a colleague of
mine about this tomb business,

698
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,274
then I mentioned Corbeck.

699
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:20,110
Swear to God, Robert, the
man went white as a ghost.

700
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,713
-So, is Corbeck some
kind of a conman?

701
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:24,415
-No, no, no, he
used to be some kind

702
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,817
of like respected
expedition leader,

703
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:30,220
until he found the tomb of Queen
Tera, then he went like nuts.

704
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,655
I mean, he started
mummifying people.

705
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:32,756
-What are you,
high or something?

706
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:33,691
-I'm honest.

707
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:35,859
He's trying to
mummify real people.

708
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:36,894
I'm not joking.

709
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:39,863
[scraping]

710
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:41,365
-What is that?

711
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:20,704
Brice!

712
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:27,678
-Robert!

713
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:33,350
No!

714
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,151
-Brice!

715
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:10,521
When he was at Scotland Yard he
had a protege, Terry Branigan,

716
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,623
23 years old, six
months in the force.

717
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:14,858
So I assigned him
to follow Corbeck.

718
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,561
Seems Corbeck does have
a history of smuggling.

719
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,330
Anyway, late one night
Branigan was following him,

720
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:24,168
and during the course
of a high speed chase,

721
00:53:24,168 --> 00:53:26,937
Corbeck beat a
train at a crossing.

722
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:29,406
Branigan didn't.

723
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:30,240
-Dangerous business.

724
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:39,917
Being up here reminds me of
the first time you and I met.

725
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:42,453
-You know, I loved your
pictures at that show of yours.

726
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:48,192
Hey, I wanna propose a
toast to your next show.

727
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:50,994
-Robert, you know I
can't stand champagne.

728
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,596
I'm just going to us some water.

729
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:53,397
-OK.

730
00:53:57,768 --> 00:54:00,104
-Whoa.

731
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:03,073
The sudden Egyptian
interest, not bad.

732
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,374
-What the hell you doing here?

733
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,543
-You're not going
to believe this.

734
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:07,778
Oh, great.

735
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:09,113
I am starved.

736
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:13,650
All right, now, I found out
because Trelawny has found

737
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,286
so many treasures, and
he gave so much money,

738
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:18,655
he has this special arrangement
with the Egyptian Minisitry

739
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:22,192
of Antiquities to study
the artifacts here.

740
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:27,531
And well, of course
like when he dies,

741
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:30,767
all the research and all the
antiquities go back to Egypt.

742
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,969
-So he's got permission.

743
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:34,304
Man, that's the best news
you could've told me.

744
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:35,873
-This is great.

745
00:54:35,873 --> 00:54:38,609
Oh, I was taking a look at
that videotape you sent over.

746
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:41,044
I'm telling you, there
are some things on there

747
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:43,213
that have never
even been cataloged.

748
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,249
-Look, you gotta go, man.

749
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:46,884
MARGARET: Hi.

750
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:47,684
-Hi.

751
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,524
Brice Renard.

752
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:54,324
-This is Margaret.

753
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:57,494
Brice is a, uh, colleague.

754
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:59,296
-Colleague?

755
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,864
I believe I taught him
everything he knows.

756
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,399
-Yeah, Brice is the janitor--

757
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,634
-Curator.

758
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:06,303
-Curator of Egyptian exhibit
at the De Young Museum.

759
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:10,140
-I, uh-- You know, I heard
that Robert was staying over

760
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:14,011
at your place, and I
would give my first born

761
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:16,446
to be able to come over and
take a look at all that.

762
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:18,382
-Any time

763
00:55:18,382 --> 00:55:23,854
-Great, you know, actually,
take a look at this.

764
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:27,691
Look at the mill work on that.

765
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:30,394
-Wow, it looks
like Third Dynasty.

766
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:32,396
Isn't that a little pricey to
carry around in your pocket?

767
00:55:32,396 --> 00:55:34,298
-Nah, I do it all the time.

768
00:55:34,298 --> 00:55:36,667
-It's beautiful.

769
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:37,701
How old is it?

770
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:42,039
-Well, technically
speaking, very old.

771
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:44,208
But we won't know for sure
until we get the test back.

772
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:58,488
-ROBERT: Brice?

773
00:56:03,894 --> 00:56:05,862
Hey, Brice, man you OK?

774
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:06,830
Brice?

775
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,631
Brice!

776
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:16,873
-I just, I-- need to
get some fresh air.

777
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:39,329
-Ow!

778
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,330
-What happened?

779
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,465
-I cut me on this bloody knife.

780
00:56:41,465 --> 00:56:42,266
-Oh!

781
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,739
Doctor better take
a look at that.

782
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,941
-Maybe you could
bring him up here.

783
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:51,775
-You sit tight.

784
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:52,843
I'll be right back.

785
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:02,019
-Well, Abel, you didn't know I
knew about your secret place,

786
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:02,819
did you?

787
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:09,860
Oh, what's this?

788
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:10,727
A copy of you special key.

789
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:16,600
Now, let's see what
you got in here.

790
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:27,010
Beautiful.

791
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:31,381
Beautiful, gov, my compliments.

792
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,556
-Last night, I
was reading a book

793
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:42,859
by a Dutch explorer,
named Van Huene.

794
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:45,329
He mentioned a seven-sided ruby.

795
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:47,230
-Strange reading for bedtime.

796
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,465
-There's also a
drawing of the jewel,

797
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,767
reflecting the light
of seven stars.

798
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:53,970
-Ah, is that so?

799
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,440
-Perhaps the jewel is the
reason you're here now.

800
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,675
-I heard Abel talk of
the jewel quite recently.

801
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:00,110
-I'm here to help my friend.

802
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:00,911
-Is that right?

803
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:02,379
-That's right.

804
00:58:02,379 --> 00:58:05,215
-You know. it's extraordinary,
but I can find you

805
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:08,118
in my hair every time someone
close to me gets hurt.

806
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:12,356
Tell you something, the
next one hurt will be you.

807
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:14,558
-Is that a threat?

808
00:58:14,558 --> 00:58:15,759
-Game of darts anyone?

809
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:29,239
OPERATOR (ON PHONE):
May I help you?

810
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:33,944
-I need to talk to someone
at Abel Trelawny estate.

811
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:35,946
Uh, my friend Robert is there.

812
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:37,948
I need to warn him.

813
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:39,383
OPERATOR: Sir, would
you like me to connect

814
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:40,417
you to directory assistance?

815
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:42,986
-Uh, Abel Trelawny's estate.

816
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:43,754
It's the curse.

817
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:45,088
They're all going to die.

818
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,124
-OPERATOR: I'll connect you
to the Sheriff's Department.

819
00:58:47,124 --> 00:58:48,592
-This scarab--

820
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:50,460
-SHERIFF (ON PHONE): Marin
County Sheriff's Department--

821
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,362
-I was looking at her
face, she was looking--

822
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,330
SHERIFF: Just calm down, sir.

823
00:58:58,869 --> 00:58:59,703
Are you still there, sir?

824
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:11,014
-Excuse me, Jimmy's
injured himself.

825
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:11,815
-Oh, dear.

826
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:17,220
-Wonder where Margaret is.

827
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:22,559
I think I'll have a
little check outside.

828
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:27,697
-Ah!

829
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:38,475
Lily!

830
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:39,276
-Ah!

831
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:48,652
-What's above this room?

832
00:59:48,652 --> 00:59:50,787
-Who's watching Abel?

833
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:51,788
-My god, he's alone.

834
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:00,197
-What the hell?

835
01:00:04,568 --> 01:00:05,368
-No!

836
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:10,340
-He's in here.

837
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:18,815
-Hold on to something.

838
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:23,753
-What's happening, John?

839
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:24,554
-Father!

840
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:31,228
Something's happening in there.

841
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:39,169
-Lily, stay there.

842
01:00:42,172 --> 01:00:43,640
All right, everyone
just hold on.

843
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,054
-MARGARET: Please, do something.

844
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,025
-All right, get out of the way.

845
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,041
Step back.

846
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:25,415
-Wait!

847
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:26,216
Let me go first.

848
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,165
MARGARET: Father?

849
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:43,166
CORBECK: Good god.

850
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:46,836
MARGARET: He needs me.

851
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:47,904
ROBERT: No, no, let
the doctor help him.

852
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:50,974
-Gwen, he my bag.

853
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:06,022
-Why did you love
the bloody doors?

854
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:08,224
Jesus Christ.

855
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,693
-It's all right to be afraid.

856
01:02:09,693 --> 01:02:11,027
Tera will not
release your father.

857
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:12,162
She'll hold him for ransom
until she gets what she wants.

858
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:16,533
-What does she want?

859
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:18,468
-For her spirit to breath again.

860
01:02:22,272 --> 01:02:25,609
-I don't care if you believe
in this bollocks you talk.

861
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:26,476
But it's over.

862
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:27,944
It's finished!

863
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:30,814
If your queen is inside
here, she's dust.

864
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:33,216
She's no more alive that
the dust my housekeeper

865
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,719
sweeps off the bloody floor.

866
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:37,220
CORBECK: You're more
the fool than I thought.

867
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:40,657
Tera, he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

868
01:02:40,657 --> 01:02:42,258
He's got no soul.

869
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,394
-Please, this is
very delicate work.

870
01:02:44,394 --> 01:02:47,097
-All right, let's
just take it easy.

871
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:48,665
Margaret, we should get
out of here, all of us.

872
01:02:48,665 --> 01:02:50,533
Your father needs
to be hospitalized.

873
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,002
-Tera will not let him leave.

874
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:53,803
-You didn't tell me.

875
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:55,472
What does she want?

876
01:02:55,472 --> 01:02:56,706
-We'll have to ask her.

877
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:58,708
-He wants a bloody
seance now, is it?

878
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,443
-Not a seance, you idiot!

879
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,013
-Or channeling or whatever
the hell you call it.

880
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:03,813
-No, no.

881
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,248
Not in this house.

882
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:08,451
Please, miss, I'll leave.

883
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:11,054
I don't want to leave him.

884
01:03:11,054 --> 01:03:13,623
And I will.

885
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,926
I'm a God fearing woman, and I
believe it when the church says

886
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:22,198
that it's a sin to
contact the dead.

887
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:24,067
-You know what you are?

888
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:25,035
Pathetic.

889
01:03:25,035 --> 01:03:27,504
Pathetic!

head up with rubbish.

Leading her on while
her father lies there--

892
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:35,311
ROBERT: Knock it off!

893
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,413
Knock it off!

894
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:37,213
MARGARET: Stop!

895
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:41,251
ROBERT: Philip!

896
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:42,318
-That's quite enough.

897
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,953
-Don't do anything
you're going to regret.

898
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:47,857
-My only regret is I didn't do
this a bloody long time ago.

899
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:49,259
-Stop!

900
01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:53,096
You two fighting your private
battle will not help my father.

901
01:03:53,096 --> 01:03:57,133
John, I really don't
believe in any of that.

902
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,944
-In this house, guns
will not help you.

903
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:58,121
-Wait, Silvio, wait.

904
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,390
[meow]

905
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:01,191
So

906
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:03,893
-Wait, wait, wait.

907
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:05,962
I don't think you have enough
lives to go down there, baby.

[door opening]

909
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,454
-God help me.

01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:15,832
ROBERT: Margaret!

912
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:16,633
Margaret!

[speaking in egyptian]

914
01:07:26,943 --> 01:07:29,345
ROBERT: Margaret!

915
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:30,813
Margaret, what are you doing?

916
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:38,254
DOCTOR: Come, pull yourself
together, Margaret.

917
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:41,724
-Is that still she?

918
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:46,195
DOCTOR: We need to take
her back to the house.

919
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:48,598
ROBERT: We need to wait
for the storm to pass.

920
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:57,573
-We've been at this a
long time, my friend.

921
01:07:57,573 --> 01:08:02,111
Now, let's see if
it's all been nothing.

922
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:04,514
[speaking in egyptian]

923
01:08:04,514 --> 01:08:06,849
-What sort of language
is that, then?

924
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:07,650
-It's ancient Egyptian.

925
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,956
-Ah, listen to this, Abel.

926
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:18,628
She's telling us that she's
Tera, Queen of the Egypts,

927
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:20,330
Daughter of Ateff,
Monarch of the North

928
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:25,568
and the South,
Daughter of the Sun.

929
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:29,539
She's introducing herself in
the most customary manner.

930
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:32,508
-I've seen some cons,
but this takes the cake.

931
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:34,744
Queen Tera, my girl?

932
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:36,679
You're no more a
bloody queen than I am.

933
01:08:40,984 --> 01:08:41,784
ROBERT: Margaret!

934
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:53,696
-I know where the jewel is.

935
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:54,597
I know where the lamps are.

936
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:55,732
I know about Abel's plan.

937
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:57,500
And I know what you want, Tera.

938
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:01,504
And I promise you,
you shall have it.

939
01:09:13,216 --> 01:09:15,518
-Christ!

940
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:17,954
-Trust John.

941
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:18,755
Do what he says.

942
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:25,528
-Abel's been planning
this for years.

943
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:26,963
The great experiment
he called it.

944
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:28,698
Bringing Tera what
she wanted to see

945
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:31,234
if the legacy
could be fulfilled.

946
01:09:31,234 --> 01:09:33,903
So, for years, we
collected everything.

947
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:36,439
Amulets, canopic jars, lamps--

948
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:37,340
-And the mummy.

949
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,475
-Yes, even Tera herself.

950
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:42,445
We dismantled her, her
tomb, piece-by-piece

951
01:09:42,445 --> 01:09:44,147
and brought it
here to the house.

952
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:44,947
-What?

953
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:46,249
-Yes.

954
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:49,419
We will capture the changes
in stars over 5,000 years,

955
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:53,656
and pick this as the perfect
location for this experiment.

956
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:57,293
What we're looking for is the
key to the tomb, the obelisk.

957
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:59,395
It was accidentally returned
to the museum in Egypt.

958
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:01,831
I had to retrieve it, and
then I had to hide it.

959
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:03,232
I was about to deliver
it to Abel, when

960
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:04,600
I spotted Daw
entering the house.

961
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,269
Not wanting to renew our
acquaintance at the time,

962
01:10:06,269 --> 01:10:08,705
and not wanting to
keep it to myself--

963
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:09,906
-Why is that?

964
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:11,207
-Well, I didn't quite
have all the right permits

965
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,742
when I left Cairo.

966
01:10:12,742 --> 01:10:15,812
Didn't know it was the bloody
key to the bloody door.

967
01:10:15,812 --> 01:10:16,713
Ah, shine the light.

968
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:24,554
-Ah, John.

969
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:25,354
What are you doing, man?

970
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:26,155
-It's here.

971
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:27,123
I know, I put it here.

972
01:10:35,098 --> 01:10:35,898
It's got to be here.

973
01:10:38,835 --> 01:10:40,570
I put it here.

974
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,537
-John, let's stop.

975
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:42,338
Let's go back.

976
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:44,273
-Hey, don't fuck with me, man!

977
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:45,074
It is here.

978
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,812
-John, there's nothing in here.

979
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:51,714
OK!

980
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:52,715
Ah, it's a head.

981
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:53,516
-Oh, god!

982
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,423
-Tera was not the
only mummy Abel

983
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:02,558
and I brought back
through the years.

984
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:04,994
Abel hid the mummies
for many years,

985
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:06,896
preparing for his experiment.

986
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:08,498
He learned that Tera
planned to come back alone,

987
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:11,968
she's being back
a court as well.

988
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:13,769
Abel gathered the other
mummies from her court,

989
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:17,273
and destroyed them, then buried
them in unsanctified ground.

990
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,479
-OK, look, I'm getting
Margaret out of here tonight.

991
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:26,916
-No, we must find this
key, and complete the--

992
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:28,384
-No, no, John we should
all get out of here.

993
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:29,051
We'll get Abel--

994
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:29,852
-No!

995
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:31,254
We must find the key.

996
01:11:31,254 --> 01:11:32,355
-It's not here!

997
01:11:32,355 --> 01:11:34,724
Look there's nothing
here but dead things.

998
01:11:34,724 --> 01:11:36,125
Look!

999
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,827
Man, what am I doing here?

1000
01:11:37,827 --> 01:11:38,628
This is crazy.

1001
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,396
Look, nothing.

1002
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:43,366
It's empty, just like
Abel's fantasies.

1003
01:11:43,366 --> 01:11:46,135
Ow!

1004
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,204
John, John, give me a hand here.

1005
01:11:48,204 --> 01:11:49,505
Ah!

1006
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:52,775
-You think you're going to
take Margaret away, do you?

1007
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:53,910
There are forces
here far greater

1008
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:54,944
than you could ever understand.

1009
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:03,319
-It's ripping my
fucking arm off.

1010
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:06,322
Get back here, you bastard.

1011
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,890
You shoulda stayed in
that damn institution,

1012
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:16,933
you crazy old-- No!

1013
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:22,271
-There it is.

1014
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:25,775
The key to the
tomb, the obelisk.

1015
01:12:25,775 --> 01:12:29,345
-Oh, John, I don't know what
the hell's going on here.

1016
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,279
Whatever it is--

1017
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:31,647
-She's not going
to go to let us go

1018
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:33,716
until she gets what she wants.

1019
01:12:39,589 --> 01:12:41,357
-There's not much
hope left here.

1020
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,825
-We can't give up.

1021
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:43,893
-The key's not there.

1022
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:45,127
It hasn't been since
his last attack.

1023
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:45,928
-Do you have the key?

1024
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:48,030
-No, I don't have the key.

1025
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,699
-We need it.

1026
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:51,534
We need to get the jewel,
and the jewel is in the safe.

1027
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:52,902
Without the jewel, he will die.

1028
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:53,803
We've got to find that key!

1029
01:12:57,473 --> 01:13:02,311
-When I was at the Yard, I met
a very interesting gentleman,

1030
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:05,448
a very talented
burglar And he could

1031
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:07,817
make short work of any lock.

1032
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:11,387
He was also very willing to
share his talents with me.

1033
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:12,588
-We're gonna have
to move everything

1034
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:14,991
down to the tomb, including
the queen herself.

1035
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:19,595
-That's it.

1036
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:21,964
-Good.

1037
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:24,100
There's a secret
compartment in the back.

1038
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:24,901
Yes.

1039
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:28,504
There it is.

1040
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,743
Look at it.

1041
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:36,412
Look at the life
in it, look at--

1042
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,315
-Incredible.

1043
01:13:39,315 --> 01:13:41,984
That is why Abel was attacked,
because of this jewel.

1044
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:42,952
Thank you very much, Phillip.

1045
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,229
Abel.

1046
01:13:53,229 --> 01:13:55,431
Abel, we're moving
everything down to the tomb.

1047
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:20,656
[tribal drums]

1048
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:47,249
CORBECK: We're here.

1049
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:01,497
You really did it.

1050
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:11,240
Let's bring in the artifacts.

1051
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:34,730
-No.

1052
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,499
Turn her around.

1053
01:15:36,499 --> 01:15:37,566
Have her facing home.

1054
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:18,340
CORBECK: Now, when the
seven stars on the plough

1055
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:24,013
are finally aligned tonight,
the precisely set prism

1056
01:16:24,013 --> 01:16:25,514
will split the light
in to each lamp.

1057
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:36,092
Then, we'll see
if Abel was right.

1058
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:41,997
But first, we must wait.

1059
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:49,872
Since you're the most trained,
and have a steady hand,

1060
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:52,475
Doctor I'll let
you do the honors,

1061
01:16:52,475 --> 01:16:59,615
sir, at the right moment.

1062
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:02,618
-Well, you do only live once.

1063
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:03,419
-Maybe.

1064
01:17:25,441 --> 01:17:26,242
-Margaret?

1065
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:35,651
-She was my secret.

1066
01:17:38,754 --> 01:17:40,322
I would talk to her for hours.

1067
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:47,463
And one day, father saw me
trying to pry the lid open.

1068
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:51,267
That's why he sent me away.

1069
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:58,507
Wyatt, I need for him to live.

1070
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,543
DAW (OFF SCREEN): Robert, it's
very important I speak to you,

1071
01:18:00,543 --> 01:18:01,343
please.

1072
01:18:05,114 --> 01:18:05,915
-Go on.

1073
01:18:05,915 --> 01:18:07,216
We have time.

1074
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:38,647
DOCTOR: -My god, seven fingers.

1075
01:18:45,621 --> 01:18:47,856
-Doctor, you look tired.

1076
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:49,792
You should go home
and get some sleep.

1077
01:18:49,792 --> 01:18:50,793
-Home?

1078
01:18:50,793 --> 01:18:53,796
This is too fantastic
to leave now.

1079
01:18:53,796 --> 01:19:04,373
-Doctor, (SPEAKING IN EGYPTIAN)

1080
01:19:04,373 --> 01:19:05,174
-Quite right.

1081
01:19:05,174 --> 01:19:06,141
I should go.

1082
01:19:25,828 --> 01:19:28,631
-I don't know what I'm doing.

1083
01:19:28,631 --> 01:19:30,032
Carrying around mummies.

1084
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:33,802
Setting up artifacts as some
sort of a cult ceremony.

1085
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:36,405
I'm a man of reason.

1086
01:19:36,405 --> 01:19:38,173
I believe in God,
but I sure as hell

1087
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:40,309
don't believe in
that Queen Tera.

1088
01:19:40,309 --> 01:19:41,577
I'm leaving.

1089
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:44,280
-So, why have you been helping
us the last three hours?

1090
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,447
-Because I had to.

1091
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:50,519
See, when Margaret
was choking me,

1092
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:55,190
I had a sensation, not just
the choking, more hypnotic

1093
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:59,528
than that, more
like a loss of will.

1094
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:00,329
-I don't understand.

1095
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:05,367
Oh my god.

1096
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:12,174
-I can't explain it.

1097
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:13,208
I can't think straight anymore.

1098
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:17,579
I simply don't want to
think anymore at all.

1099
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:25,020
I, um, I need to get some sleep.

1100
01:20:32,428 --> 01:20:36,098
Please tell Margaret that I'll
contact her in a few days.

1101
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:42,338
-Hey, Phillip, take
care of yourself, man.

1102
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:44,206
-Where are you going, Sargent?

1103
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:47,309
John says it's almost time.

1104
01:20:47,309 --> 01:20:50,879
-Um, I have some work to do.

1105
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:51,880
I shall be back in a few days.

1106
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,652
-Well, if we don't
see each other soon,

1107
01:20:56,652 --> 01:20:59,488
the best of luck to you.

1108
01:20:59,488 --> 01:21:00,289
-Goodbye, Robert.

1109
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:07,663

1110
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:15,971
-Daw.

1111
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:16,872
KEENE: Where have you been?

1112
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,607
I've been trying to reach you.

1113
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:20,275
Listen, the Marin sheriff
found our man fried

1114
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:23,445
like an egg in a phone
booth down the hill

1115
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:25,013
from you, poor bastard.

1116
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:26,181
-Relevance Keene?

1117
01:21:26,181 --> 01:21:28,150
KEENE: He has Trelawny's
address in his pocket.

1118
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:30,352
And the butler, Hutchins,
his friends called the police

1119
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:33,021
and said he was missing, said
he went back to the house

1120
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:34,223
to collect his things.

1121
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,424
And what happened to me?

1122
01:21:35,424 --> 01:21:37,826
Man, you ain't paying me
to go through that again.

1123
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:39,294
That house is cursed!

1124
01:21:39,294 --> 01:21:40,396
Get them out of there.

1125
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:41,196
-Those bastards!

1126
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:18,200
Mr. Trelawny?

1127
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:45,661
Oh, Jimmy.

1128
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:00,509
Damn!

1129
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,982
Mr. Trelawny, sir?

1130
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:07,783
Good, it's you.

1131
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:12,888
I could do with a hand.

1132
01:23:12,888 --> 01:23:15,324
I seem to be stuck,
sinking, you know.

1133
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:20,896
Damn you!

1134
01:23:20,896 --> 01:23:23,131
I need some help!

1135
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:24,633
Help!

1136
01:23:24,633 --> 01:23:26,368
Something's pulling me down.

1137
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:46,488
What the hell?

1138
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:57,933
I gotta get out of here!

1139
01:23:57,933 --> 01:23:58,734
Oh, no!

1140
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:39,041
-That's it.

1141
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:40,575
It's started.

1142
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:41,376
Set the lamps, quickly.

1143
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:43,078
Quickly, man.

1144
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:45,881
Stars don't stand still,
Not even for the queen.

1145
01:25:02,531 --> 01:25:03,332
Now, we'll see.

1146
01:25:08,637 --> 01:25:09,438
Look.

1147
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:11,306
Tera did it.

1148
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:12,274
-It's unbelievable.

1149
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:18,280
-Look at her skin,
untouched by time.

1150
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:23,885
-The blood is fresh.

1151
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:24,686
-Uh.

1152
01:25:32,828 --> 01:25:34,262
-She needs her jewel.

1153
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:38,033
Stand back.

1154
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:10,966
-John, what's going on here?

1155
01:26:27,082 --> 01:26:28,550
-She's moving.

1156
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:31,019

ROBERT: Margaret, get back.

1159
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:50,305
-All my father every wanted
to do was to help you.

1160
01:26:50,305 --> 01:26:54,142
Would you please,
please release him.

1161
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:54,943
ROBERT: Margaret!

1162
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:05,187
-Corbeck, we gotta
stop this now.

1163
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:11,693
Knock that lamp over.

1164
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:12,494
Corbeck!

1165
01:27:20,936 --> 01:27:21,770
-No.

1166
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:22,604
-Get the hell out of--

1167
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:24,039
-It's too late to stop it now.

1168
01:27:24,039 --> 01:27:24,840
-Are you crazy?

1169
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,674
What's wrong with you?

1170
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:31,113
-You never did understand.

1171
01:27:31,113 --> 01:27:34,716
This is the way it was
always supposed to be.

1172
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:35,550
This was Abel's desire.

1173
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:36,618
The resurrection of Queen Tera.

1174
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,390
The only thing he
did not know when

1175
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,926
he put the two pieces of
tablet together was that she

1176
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:45,994
was going to come back through--

1177
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,201
--Through me.

1178
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:11,653
-Will not stop it.

1179
01:28:16,658 --> 01:28:20,128
You can't stop this.

1180
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:35,777
But tonight, you are
to witness a miracle,

1181
01:28:35,777 --> 01:28:37,145
something that has
never happened before.

1182
01:28:51,593 --> 01:28:55,363
Resurrection of Queen Tera!

1183
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:01,403
And you know where she
would be without me?

1184
01:29:01,403 --> 01:29:02,337
Huh?

1185
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:03,738
Answer me!

1186
01:29:03,738 --> 01:29:07,042
-Dust

1187
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:08,376
-That's right.

1188
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:14,249
She would be dust.

1189
01:29:17,652 --> 01:29:19,154
Tonight, I hold power.

1190
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:30,498
Tonight, it will be my destiny
to bring her back to life.

1191
01:29:30,498 --> 01:29:34,502
-So, she's be
nothing without you.

1192
01:29:34,502 --> 01:29:35,971
-That's right.

01:29:35,971 --> 01:29:39,474
ROBERT: Yeah,
John, that's right.

1194
01:29:39,474 --> 01:29:41,643
It's all about you, you
stupid son of a bitch.

1195
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:47,515
-You need me, don't you?

1196
01:29:47,515 --> 01:29:50,485
Huh?

1197
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:52,320
Tonight, I own the power.
