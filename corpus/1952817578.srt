00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,814
Hey! Excuse me. You there.

1
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:52,875
Looking for work? Trabajo? Trabajo?

2
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:08,609
Hey, my father is looking for somebody
to clean the pool.

3
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:16,678
"Hard-Pressed in the Heartland - Peter Rachleff"

4
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,748
"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea - Marcus Rediker"
Going boating?

4
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,748
Where the fuck have you been fratboy?

5
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:32,850
You trying to get an education on the sly?

6
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:35,420
Yeah. He steals books for the donut lady.

7
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:37,306
Ew. Not Marta. She's way too old.
- Yeah it's sad.

8
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:42,085
Fuck you trailer trash.
When did you last have a date that wasn't your hand?

9
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:47,273
Damn I miss you boys.
Come on, let's get some juice.

10
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:04,191
No man, it's all sugar. It should be illegal.

11
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:15,833
- Work, uh need work.
- No work. Go away.

12
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:21,203
- Please. I good worker.
- Hey, what are you deaf son?

13
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:24,176
I said no work! Nada. Adios.

14
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:27,850
Please give me work.
- Hey buddy, did you hear the man?

15
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:29,951
He said there's no work.

16
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:35,456
Oh shit. Call the cops.
I'll take care of it.

17
00:04:35,457 --> 00:04:39,948
Listen chico. You leave or were calling the cops.
Policia. Policia.

18
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:46,653
Boten a este chico a taco bell

19
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:06,787
Let's hit the border.
Before the border hits you!

20
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:47,050
There! He's heading back to the fence.
Put the brights. Now now now!

21
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,427
Fucking beaner.
Look at him run

22
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,427
David! Shit!

23
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:56,968
Come back!

24
00:05:57,003 --> 00:06:00,678
Come back to the Marlboro Land!

25
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:02,789
Come on in!

26
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:06,958
Disneyland is just a half away!

27
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:10,050
You can have it all!

28
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:16,380
Eat all you can!
A Walmart for every family!

29
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:20,166
USA all the way! USA all the way!

30
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:26,118
Call it in!

31
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:29,830
Calling Officer Sherrot. Calling Officer Sherrot.
This is the warboys.

31
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:33,830
We got a whole herd stateside just at
the Deadman's Canyon. Get them while they're hot!

32
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:37,843
Let's go track 'em!
- What? No no way!

33
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:40,971
- David stop fucking around
- That's asking for trouble man. No.

33
00:06:42,877 --> 00:06:44,971
Pussies

33
00:06:45,877 --> 00:06:47,971
Come on! Come on!

34
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:26,086
USA all the way! USA all the way!

36
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:06,196
Storm Lake, Iowa

37
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,773
Wakey wakey

37
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,773
Get out of my face

38
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:24,233
You still got a pool?
- Sure. Its in the top right drawer.

38
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:27,233
Nature calls

39
00:12:03,436 --> 00:12:06,951
Don't shoot. I'm a US citizen.
Honest!

40
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:11,045
Scared me half to death.

41
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:14,360
I'll take her home

42
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:19,937
She says the bike's her own but it can't be.
It's a thousand dollar bike.

43
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:23,208
Look. I borrowed the bike.

44
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:26,647
You're in trouble miss.

45
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,802
- I am trouble mister

45
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,802
OK. Lets say 3 o' clock.

46
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:35,823
And look I'm gonna have to postpone
that trip to Houston.

47
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:41,500
My son's in town. I know. I know
But it'll wait

48
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,970
They need me

49
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:51,148
Well, its good to see you boys again.

50
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:56,729
Still working weekends on the
garage, Gregorio?

51
00:12:56,789 --> 00:13:01,374
Ahh. That's me. Actually I'm thinking
of helping my dad out with his business.

52
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:06,703
María I'll have those eggs now por favor.
And you Greg?

53
00:13:06,732 --> 00:13:09,553
Still at the library Mr. Welch.

54
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:13,379
- But I'm thinking of taking some night classes.
- Good for you.

55
00:13:14,474 --> 00:13:16,920
We still miss your father

56
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:19,343
He was one of our finest at the border patrol.

57
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,645
Boys, sorry to say..

58
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:35,876
but i've got to steal David for a couple of hours
this afternoon. Father and son, you know

58
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:37,876
Heart to heart

59
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,015
We miss him didn't we George?

60
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:47,379
He begged to fly home weekend after weekend.
I said no, wait till spring break

61
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:51,672
and show 'em what your made of.
And they will show you the...

62
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:55,667
The ladder to the top

62
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:57,667
Dad

63
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:05,099
My son needs his studies and the sports.
And what with his looks

64
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:08,651
God knows how much sex

65
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:13,437
Dad they're not interested.
- But they are! Aren't you boys?

66
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:20,237
Maria some more syrup for George here
and Greg here, have another donut.

67
00:14:21,842 --> 00:14:28,030
My son. Straight A's. 
Sports trophies up the yin yang.


68
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,427
Landed at the 5th best school in the nation.

69
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:37,024
- And now..
- You're boring them Dad.

70
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:40,560
Well then entertain us my son.
Tell us what's new.

71
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:43,949
- Quit!
- I got a call from the dean last night.
What do you suppose he had to tell me?

72
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:45,318
Christ!

73
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,157
We must bring our entertainment to a close

74
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,179
David. Noon at my office.

75
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:03,900
Its good to see you boys.

76
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:11,972
What's your Dad so pissed about?
- You and me Greg, he thinks we're trash.

77
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:15,842
Nothing to do with you

78
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:20,025
I'm not on break from school.
I was suspended

79
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:22,523
What?
- You cut classes?

80
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:24,866
I went to all my classes

81
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:28,180
And got naked
- Bullshit!

82
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:32,746
Sitting in class one day I just felt
constricted so I took my clothes off

83
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:35,032
Piece by piece
I left my socks on though

84
00:15:35,082 --> 00:15:38,676
Sat the entire way through 
my first class bare-assed

85
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:40,551
And the second class someone objected.
It was a political science class.

86
00:15:40,587 --> 00:15:43,579
That is fucked up man.
- What are you gonna do?

87
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:47,149
What gets me is how long it took anyone to object. 
Nobody asked me what the hell I was doing.

88
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:50,594
They just pretended I was dressed.

89
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:59,230
Ok, why'd you do it?

90
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:02,639
They were asleep. Fuckin' zombies.

91
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:07,042
They needed a wake up call
- Jesus. You put your nuts on display 
for the whole world to see. No way!

92
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,322
I was tired of waking up every morning
and thinking what the fuck am I doing here?

93
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,740
So I shed my skin and headed home.
Adios duke! This is where I wanna be.

94
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:17,096
We love you too buddy

95
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:41,136
How you doin' David?
You back from spring break?

96
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:46,015
I thought I should check in with my boys
- Well, give your father my regards

96
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,015
Return of the conquering hero eh?

97
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:56,072
We missed you, George says he can at least
write a postcard and I say you got hands, write him yourself

98
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:59,246
But no...

99
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:04,298
Hey Cactus, you look good on that bike

100
00:17:05,104 --> 00:17:10,189
George, George sweetheart I need your help a minute.

101
00:17:10,242 --> 00:17:12,177
Cortex Taxi Service. Always running.

102
00:17:12,212 --> 00:17:15,567
Saw it on a film

103
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:20,785
Got to go

104
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,370
Take this and get rid of it.


104
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:31,370
Thanks boys.
I don't know where she keeps finding them.

106
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:52,900
Brought you another book

107
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:02,630
- Griffiths - These Are The Times
- Yeah, these are the times

108
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:08,250
- How about tonight?
- What exactly is your criteria for choosing my books?

108
00:18:08,563 --> 00:18:11,250
When I was on the return pile

109
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:18,469
You know I'm risking jail 
stealing these books for you

110
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:23,337
- You owe me a date
- Not tonight

111
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:27,099
Tomorrow night?

112
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:41,712
I know that happened

113
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:45,476
Yeah, everyone knows what happened

114
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:49,301
You know her?

115
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:56,687
So we got a date tomorrow or what?

116
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:04,454
Well, it's a start I guess

117
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:08,884
You got a sweetheart up at Duke?

117
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:11,884
Someone special?

118
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:14,582
I haven't met any of them too special

119
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:19,116
- Things ok? You seem kinda...
- Jumpy?

120
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:23,687
Here have my sandwich. I'm not hungry.

121
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:27,963
- You lost weight.
- Dad, what's the problem?

122
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,653
- Tell it to me straight
- Debts, David

123
00:19:30,716 --> 00:19:32,741
Lean and mean times

124
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:34,912
It's always something. So...

125
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:39,788
you got to take risks and when you do
everybody gets a little jumpy

126
00:19:40,326 --> 00:19:45,855
But you stick with it. 
Competition strangles the best of us

127
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:52,110
It's knowing how far you can bend
the rules of the game

128
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:55,356
Tell me Dad, you know you can trust me

129
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:02,887
My trucks carry all sorts these days

130
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:06,043
And so you have to make arrangements
with the border patrol

131
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:08,417
Jesus Dad

132
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:12,435
- Drugs?
- Televisions

133
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,905
Designer Jeans
- Black market?

134
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:18,464
- I knew it
- It's called the free market

135
00:20:18,497 --> 00:20:19,954
But my concern is your future not mine

136
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,369
Listen Dad, I got this all figured out
I quit school, I stay here with you

137
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:28,066
It'll be like you used to say
after mom died

138
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:30,507
"It's just you and me now we've got to stick together"

139
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:32,159
And we can do that here working side by side


139
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:33,159
Go on

140
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:37,441
I'm natural when it comes to business
I don't need a degree in law

141
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:40,815
I've got everything I need right here
We'll take over, you and me

142
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:44,118
Are you finished?
- No, Dad remember?

143
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,059
It's the wild west out there
and we can tame it

144
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:51,768
You're going back to school
- No, Dad, listen

145
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:57,144
How did you think I've felt when that dean called me?
And why did you pull such a pathetic stunt?

146
00:20:57,202 --> 00:21:01,798
For attention? We're you feeling lonesome?
Did you need a hug?

147
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,628
You have no idea. You think I didn't try to fit in?
Huh? That I didn't try to make it work?

148
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:09,648
The only place that I'm happy is here with you.

149
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:10,933
I'm not going back

150
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:17,301
I love you, but you are going back to school
and you're gonna be the best damn lawyer in the state

151
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:21,178
Things are gonna work out just like we planned
- Fuck him! Fuck! Fuck!

152
00:21:31,437 --> 00:21:35,259
Would you two like to make some serious money?
- How?

153
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:40,131
TVs, truckload. Easy steal, risk free

154
00:21:41,246 --> 00:21:43,430
From my Dad

155
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,652
That's low
That's scraping the bottom of the barrel

156
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,851
I'm in

157
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,499
No. I'm..
To a parent like that? It's like Original Sin

158
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:03,001
So? He won't miss 'em.
They're black market from Mexico

159
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:06,527
Whose gonna complain? And no one will suspect us

160
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:08,426
I'm in

161
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:14,137
You already said that. Give me back my hat

162
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:18,866
I'm getting out of here. I'm not wasting myself

163
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:24,944
Shit

164
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:29,685
How much are we talkin'?

165
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:32,572
Thousands

166
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:47,670
Hey, put the books back on the shelves

167
00:22:57,156 --> 00:23:00,899
Why are you doing this to your Dad?
- Coz it's a thrill

168
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:06,746
And we need a thrill. Fuck it
- Fuck it?

169
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:10,358
Cmon David don't bullshit me

170
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:13,792
What the hell's with you?

171
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:17,024
Talk to me or I'll hit you

172
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:23,178
I don't know

173
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,139
I don't fuckin' know

174
00:23:28,153 --> 00:23:33,090
It's ok, I guess

175
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:39,750
I missed you

176
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:45,337
Yeah

177
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:54,621
It used to be a frontier out here
Kill or be killed. Be a slave or be free

178
00:23:55,614 --> 00:23:59,675
And now what are the choices that matter?
Paper, plastic, Lubricated rib?

179
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:05,200
Regular, decaf, eat in, take out
- Pay to go or contract - To rent or to buy

180
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,937
Let's do it!

181
00:24:09,995 --> 00:24:12,509
Fuck it!

182
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:28,091
Want to get us shot?

183
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:33,145
10:30. She's due

184
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:38,462
Where is everybody?
- They'll hit the canteen before it closes at 10:30

185
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,857
It's cool. Done my homework

186
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:46,365
Does anyone else have a sense of doom?

187
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,473
Greg, bolt cutters are yours
- Right boss

188
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,157
Log in, change in drivers. 
Tell a few jokes. Take a leak

188
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:12,157
Ok. you've got about 3 minutes.
Ready?

189
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:16,245
Let's go

190
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:05,139
Shit!

191
00:27:57,089 --> 00:28:01,276
Are you sure its gonna be ok here?
- Scrapyard will think its the army. Army will think its the scrapyard

192
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:05,571
Need to find someone to sell them to
- Your Dad won't report it, right?

193
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,827
No way
- Oh man. He's gonna be pissed

194
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:11,813
So when do we sell them?

195
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:15,636
We need to get down low in a few days.
We need to make an increase, right George?

196
00:28:15,674 --> 00:28:18,848
How much time do you need?
- Two, three days at the most

197
00:28:18,877 --> 00:28:21,323
I know just the guy

198
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:09,697
Fuck it

199
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:16,783
Thank you

200
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,675
Always old fashioned.

201
00:30:27,372 --> 00:30:29,806
One sugar donut

202
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:33,426
And six donut holes.

203
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:36,380
Make it quick

204
00:30:37,015 --> 00:30:41,122
Got a long day ahead of you partner?
- Long enough

205
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:44,202
You heading for the border?

206
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:47,987
You with the law?
- Whose law?

207
00:30:51,696 --> 00:30:55,132
Roger, Slater, morning

208
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:58,796
Roger listen, bad news. We had a theft last night

209
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:04,018
Yeah. Fully loaded

210
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:07,602
Of course I do. That's not it
I didn't want to wake you

211
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:11,139
Trust me I'm taking care of this

212
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:15,846
Yeah, I'm gonna send them out to
find the usual suspects

213
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:19,415
Exacly. Relax

214
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:21,345
Relax, we'll find it

215
00:31:21,393 --> 00:31:23,543
I'll call you back

216
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,436
I didn't get much sleep last night
- It looks that way

217
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,268
Hey David you up for a swim?
- I don't think so

217
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,268
Well, I'll leave you alone then..

218
00:31:51,523 --> 00:31:53,741
What the hell?

219
00:31:55,961 --> 00:32:00,910
Zero out of ten for that dive.

220
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:38,137
What's up Dad?

221
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:43,173
One of our trucks was stolen last night
- Shit

222
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:46,566
Can we get it back?
- Unlikely

223
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:49,250
Our concern now is to find out who took it
and keep a lid on this

224
00:32:50,782 --> 00:32:54,001
This is a well planned operation

225
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:56,589
Professionals?
- Yeah

226
00:32:56,655 --> 00:32:59,328
But we've got our own professionals 
who will find them.

227
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:03,077
In the meantime, you just get your head ready
to get back to your educaton

228
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:12,512
I'm gonna fuck who ever did this

229
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:31,410
None of your fuckin' business

230
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,411
Don't move

231
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:17,197
Did they hurt you?

232
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:21,717
I got a hard knee
I don't look like an illegal, do I?

233
00:34:23,174 --> 00:34:28,146
I just got mugged. I think I'm owed
to something nice. Nourishing.

233
00:34:29,174 --> 00:34:31,146
Nourishing?

234
00:34:31,282 --> 00:34:35,912
You need to teach me how to make donuts

235
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:40,337
- Howdy
- Hi honey

235
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:42,337
Where's Kat?

236
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:45,932
She went to get you donuts
- Hey hey, on the nail please

237
00:34:45,964 --> 00:34:49,639
Old tuber Tyler says he saw you the other night
- Oh yeah?

238
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:52,192
Still out with the border patrol?

239
00:34:52,237 --> 00:34:57,061
I would rather not you doing your partying on the border
- We're not partying out there mom

240
00:34:57,709 --> 00:35:02,976
Patrol's worth shit without us

241
00:35:03,014 --> 00:35:07,360
Hey, I will not have that kind of
trash talk in this family

242
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:09,262
Sorry mom

243
00:35:44,022 --> 00:35:48,834
When I was five, I used to sit on
his shoulders and play drums on his head

244
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:53,593
We used to be friends, but now
I'm just a beaner to him

245
00:35:56,034 --> 00:36:00,630
The ones that are here I love
but the others I don't know about

246
00:36:03,074 --> 00:36:06,555
Have you given up a daughter?

247
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:10,670
Maybe you forgot

248
00:36:19,924 --> 00:36:24,213
Me too, I have to get this
donuts to my brother

249
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:38,947
Not so thick. Just half an inch

250
00:36:46,451 --> 00:36:49,557
How come you don't have a boyfriend?

251
00:36:58,463 --> 00:37:03,480
Now, If I make the perfect donut...

252
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:07,146
Will you go out with me?

253
00:37:16,548 --> 00:37:19,119
I like older women

254
00:37:21,052 --> 00:37:25,102
Older women. The way you say it
sounds like you starters

255
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:45,705
Show me

256
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:15,702
Now those are perfect donuts

257
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:21,535
What time should I pick you up?

258
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:25,303
Mom, I want to be a vision to the devil himself

259
00:40:27,772 --> 00:40:30,639
My devil is out back

260
00:40:41,652 --> 00:40:46,225
Great, did you chew them up especially for me?

261
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:49,530
I got them for you
- Have you seen your pillow?

262
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,018
Who cares about my pillow?

262
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,018
Who cares?

263
00:40:57,268 --> 00:41:01,602
Shit. You know what when you came to us as a baby I used to spit on your head everytime I walk by your cradle cause I knew how you'd turn out

264
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,778
You liar

265
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,852
Speak English, Jesus!

266
00:41:08,913 --> 00:41:12,326
I'm just waiting for the day you disappear to 
one of your detours so I can have some peace

267
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,716
Why don't you move out like a real adult

268
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:18,608
and give me some air to breath?
It's an embarrassment to be your sister.

269
00:41:21,192 --> 00:41:23,865
Look at your skin

270
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:26,602
Your not my sister

271
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,198
Yeah, I am

272
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:46,593
Where to sir?

272
00:41:47,283 --> 00:41:49,593
Anywhere but here

273
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:55,684
Didn't ever bother you and mom when you adopted her?

274
00:41:55,727 --> 00:41:57,126
Never

275
00:41:57,196 --> 00:41:59,336
She's not one of us

276
00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:03,777
What bothers me is whats what I knew

277
00:42:05,703 --> 00:42:09,434
I'm just a regular shit

278
00:42:11,075 --> 00:42:13,566
Hey give me a smoke will you?

279
00:42:19,116 --> 00:42:21,778
Me and David

280
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:24,003
We're gonna make some money

281
00:42:24,055 --> 00:42:26,922
And were gonna travel

282
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:39,115
Sorry I got no cash

283
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:45,346
Walch, your name is Walch?
- Yup, that's me

284
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:48,550
Slater Walch?
- My father

285
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,699
I don't want your money.
You're not welcome here, please leave.

286
00:42:54,652 --> 00:42:57,371
Wait a minute...
- Tell your father his business stinks

287
00:42:57,421 --> 00:43:01,585
I'll have no part of it. Go

288
00:43:12,536 --> 00:43:16,188
I have to meet George and David later
on at the Old train depot

289
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,720
You ever been there?

290
00:43:21,479 --> 00:43:25,006
Well, we used to hang there when
we were kids, you should come.

291
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:28,746
Ok, but I've got to stop by
at the garage first and check a leak

292
00:43:29,387 --> 00:43:31,446
So it's a date right?

293
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:33,548
Don't count on it

294
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:12,053
You used to wear that T-shirt back on tenth grade.
Look cool on you then

295
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:14,917
- Thanks
- Looks cool on you now

296
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:29,033
Shit. Have to fix that

297
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:59,282
He's pretty pissed about the truck

298
00:45:00,411 --> 00:45:05,098
I thought he'd just ride it off
- I said he'd be pissed

299
00:45:07,018 --> 00:45:09,202
He's pissed

300
00:45:11,122 --> 00:45:15,138
Well I'm a thief, you're a thief

301
00:45:17,028 --> 00:45:19,030
Right?

302
00:45:20,664 --> 00:45:22,689
Right

303
00:45:30,408 --> 00:45:33,980
So you got a girl up at dock?

304
00:45:37,314 --> 00:45:40,636
Girl up in dock to fuck me

305
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,405
No time

306
00:45:48,192 --> 00:45:52,572
Well I'm gonna introduce you to some of my ladies. 
Show you the spell of relief

307
00:46:17,621 --> 00:46:19,782
Keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn't steal anything

308
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:31,499
You know of anyone who could use some TV's?

309
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,374
My little girl wants one in her room

310
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:42,004
How many you got?
- A truck load

311
00:46:47,151 --> 00:46:50,666
Do I look like someone who could use a truckload?

312
00:46:50,688 --> 00:46:54,920
I'm dirty because I'm a mechanic
not a criminal

313
00:46:59,763 --> 00:47:04,279
Besides nothing good on TV in it, right

314
00:47:12,009 --> 00:47:16,207
What about a legit ID? You have driver's license

315
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:21,588
I'll give you forty dollars
- No, thank you

316
00:47:21,619 --> 00:47:24,986
Why not? You can get another one

317
00:47:25,022 --> 00:47:29,504
I thought you weren't a criminal?
- Helping poor folks get a job, criminal?

318
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,563
I'm not giving my ID to some illegal

319
00:47:32,596 --> 00:47:35,633
Why?
- Coz you're legal?

320
00:47:37,201 --> 00:47:40,170
I was born this side of the border

321
00:47:40,204 --> 00:47:42,354
Really?

322
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:51,146
Which border?

322
00:47:53,279 --> 00:47:55,146
That one?

323
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,936
What if I just stepped across your
border like it wasn't even there?

324
00:48:18,642 --> 00:48:21,850
I'll give you a dollar for a smile

325
00:48:22,947 --> 00:48:26,257
No, maybe a quarter

326
00:48:29,253 --> 00:48:32,393
Can I kiss you?
- No

327
00:48:40,664 --> 00:48:43,462
Do you wanna hear something funny?

328
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:49,380
I'm still a virgin
- What?

329
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,601
Do I have to say it again?

330
00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:56,182
I'm a virgin. Ok?
- Wow

331
00:48:56,247 --> 00:48:59,796
But hey I mean, I don't need a map

332
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:05,712
I just never did the.. you know..
all the way

333
00:49:09,827 --> 00:49:12,637
But I'm a fast learner

334
00:49:25,175 --> 00:49:27,791
Give me your best shot trailer trash

335
00:49:27,811 --> 00:49:32,384
Oh I'm so jealous my Daddy 
can't buy me a new truck

336
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:38,579
Nope

337
00:49:38,622 --> 00:49:42,968
We just got this old taxi and
drive in circles forever

338
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:50,399
You know? I didn't miss you, fratboy!

339
00:49:53,537 --> 00:49:57,724
Old high school game. See who flinches first

340
00:49:57,775 --> 00:50:00,710
Greg always lost

341
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,456
Want to get something to eat?
How about some dogs?

342
00:50:14,825 --> 00:50:17,544
All this time

343
00:50:17,594 --> 00:50:20,700
You've been the donut lady
Now here you are

344
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,487
What do you mean? That I'm an ancient
and I'm mark from the neighborhood with

344
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,487
surprise, suprise, little life still left in her?

345
00:50:28,605 --> 00:50:33,827
Or that I'm an aztec statue?
That miraculously comes a lot than all her fierce beauty.

346
00:50:34,978 --> 00:50:39,108
Any other choices?
- Have some respect fratboy

347
00:50:39,149 --> 00:50:43,108
I can take care of myself.
- Hey Gregorio

348
00:50:43,153 --> 00:50:44,919
Did you hear about those uh...

349
00:50:45,957 --> 00:50:50,518
six greasers who fell asleep on the railroad tracks
there are strips of bacon by the morning.

350
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:53,337
George you're ruining my appetite

351
00:50:53,397 --> 00:50:57,572
The six less of Greg's compadres 
over here to steal my job
 

352
00:50:57,601 --> 00:50:59,671
What job? You don't do beaner jobs

353
00:51:07,211 --> 00:51:10,829
Oh wow, what a date. Grade school fighting
and trashing beaners at the same time

354
00:51:10,848 --> 00:51:13,624
How do you boys do it?
- We ain't pleased baby

355
00:51:14,718 --> 00:51:18,859
Didn't Greg told you?
We're the war boys

356
00:51:18,889 --> 00:51:21,983
Back in high school, we used to have
chicks like you running scared.

357
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:25,381
How frightening. This little wetback
is just shivering in her slippers

358
00:51:32,503 --> 00:51:36,223
She's... an aztec beauty

359
00:51:39,576 --> 00:51:44,582
and she's shivering in her slippers

360
00:51:49,386 --> 00:51:54,608
She's an aztec beauty...

361
00:52:20,184 --> 00:52:22,323
I'm getting dizzy

362
00:52:24,955 --> 00:52:26,934
Stop it!

363
00:52:34,667 --> 00:52:36,623
Stupid gringos!

363
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:38,623
All of you

364
00:52:41,672 --> 00:52:43,879
Shit

365
00:53:11,268 --> 00:53:16,820
I was always alone in high school

366
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:24,060
Most of the kids in my class were white

367
00:53:27,282 --> 00:53:31,107
Then one of them asked me to join the war boys.

368
00:53:31,154 --> 00:53:35,158
You know, it was on of those chase the 
beaners high school club

369
00:53:37,327 --> 00:53:41,798
Sometimes we'd spot an illegal and
call the border patrol

370
00:53:41,832 --> 00:53:44,676
Sometimes we chase them in our cars

371
00:53:48,171 --> 00:53:51,925
Mostly we drove around and made noise

372
00:53:53,544 --> 00:53:57,753
We never hurt anybody

373
00:53:59,316 --> 00:54:02,672
Not everyone just drove around.
People got hurt

374
00:54:02,686 --> 00:54:06,361
Some people get killed.

375
00:54:06,423 --> 00:54:08,436
Not by us

376
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:17,009
When they asked you to join the 
war boys, did you think you were white too?

377
00:54:17,034 --> 00:54:20,492
I was ready to be anything they 
wanted me to be

378
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:26,494
And now?

379
00:54:26,543 --> 00:54:29,000
What do you wanna be?

380
00:54:29,046 --> 00:54:33,358
With you
- And what would you do to be with me?

381
00:54:36,253 --> 00:54:38,369
Anything

382
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:42,256
I don't believe you
- Try me

383
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:43,998
Ok

384
00:54:46,063 --> 00:54:50,194
Show me that you want me
- How?

385
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:52,112
Come

385
00:54:52,234 --> 00:54:54,112
Come where?

386
00:54:54,137 --> 00:54:57,413
Just come. Right here. Now

387
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:03,290
Your kidding?
- It's payback for your little stunt back there

388
00:55:03,782 --> 00:55:05,660
No way

388
00:55:05,782 --> 00:55:08,660
All right well, I'm going home

389
00:55:08,685 --> 00:55:11,654
Wait, sit down, sit down

390
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:41,231
Talk to me

391
00:55:42,285 --> 00:55:45,493
How?
- Just talk, just talk

392
00:56:01,872 --> 00:56:04,670
Tell me something nice

393
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:06,767
Talk to me

394
00:56:26,963 --> 00:56:28,544
Breathe

395
00:57:15,645 --> 00:57:20,127
What else do you want me to do?

396
00:57:46,743 --> 00:57:49,849
We're sorry
- Yeah

397
00:57:49,913 --> 00:57:53,155
I was really obnoxious, ok?

398
00:57:55,886 --> 00:57:58,810
Well look, we'll make it up to you Marta

399
00:57:58,855 --> 00:58:02,564
So look, we're going boating

400
00:58:03,593 --> 00:58:05,584
I don't think so

401
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:11,366
What do you mean boating?

402
00:59:11,528 --> 00:59:15,157
Well here's our lady - Marta de Asis
- We'd like to talk to you alone

403
00:59:15,165 --> 00:59:18,043
Who were you?
- You used to work for Welch Trucking?

404
00:59:18,034 --> 00:59:22,391
I was a temp driver for a lot of different
companies but that was a long time ago

405
00:59:22,439 --> 00:59:24,384
What do you want with her?
- Stay out of this

406
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:27,296
They've got a truck stolen. They're very upset
- That's too bad for them

407
00:59:27,344 --> 00:59:29,642
That's not my line of business

408
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:34,115
We found out that you and your wetback friends
have anything to do with this, it's gonna hurt. Comprende?

409
00:59:42,425 --> 00:59:45,792
I gotta go. I should go home

410
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:47,818
Wait a minute, stay with me

411
00:59:47,864 --> 00:59:50,822
I'm sorry

412
00:59:57,741 --> 01:00:00,517
Damn

413
01:00:01,044 --> 01:00:04,559
This here is a pretty thorny mess

414
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:43,814
Goddamnit! You're pulling askew with those things

415
01:00:52,729 --> 01:00:56,893
Last one's in deep

416
01:01:09,312 --> 01:01:13,703
I think I can feel your breath on my ass

417
01:01:19,189 --> 01:01:23,683
Is that your breath on my ass?
- I'm trying to get the thorns out, will you shut up?

418
01:01:23,727 --> 01:01:27,094
Are you getting the thorns out of my ass
or you know...

419
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:30,270
touching... my ass

420
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:35,272
I'm touching your ass to get the thorns out

421
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:38,547
I just want to make sure the
lines don't get crossed here

422
01:01:41,277 --> 01:01:44,428
They got crossed some years ago

423
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:50,206
Once

424
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:54,640
And I hardly remember it

425
01:01:55,191 --> 01:01:58,183
I remember everything

426
01:01:58,228 --> 01:02:03,120
The only thing that felt better
than you putting your hand on me...

427
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:06,567
is when I put my hand on you

428
01:02:09,072 --> 01:02:12,041
Shut the fuck up.
We we're just kids

429
01:02:15,545 --> 01:02:17,172
Sure

430
01:02:18,581 --> 01:02:22,151
And you know where that line is now don't you?
- You damn right I do

430
01:02:22,481 --> 01:02:24,151
So just to be certain...

431
01:02:25,955 --> 01:02:28,867
Why don't you tell me where it is?

432
01:02:34,764 --> 01:02:37,995
Is it here?

433
01:02:38,568 --> 01:02:43,335
Most definitely. Yup 

434
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:49,649
So that means... I could touch you here?
Right?

435
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:57,793
All american ok. Check

436
01:02:59,389 --> 01:03:01,687
And...

437
01:03:01,724 --> 01:03:03,840
Here?

438
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:09,070
David, I know who I am

439
01:03:11,034 --> 01:03:13,867
What if I crossed it?

440
01:03:16,106 --> 01:03:19,325
And touch you here

441
01:03:23,613 --> 01:03:26,810
Say you want me

442
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:31,023
Get the hell away from me

443
01:03:34,257 --> 01:03:36,612
All right

444
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,444
All right

445
01:03:43,233 --> 01:03:48,182
What would it mean if I said that
I wanted you?

446
01:03:48,204 --> 01:03:50,764
Anything you want?

447
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:54,518
No, no, go to the garage

448
01:04:55,071 --> 01:04:58,290
Our plan is fucked
- What?

449
01:04:58,308 --> 01:05:01,755
Your Dad has sent goons
to find out who took the truck

450
01:05:02,312 --> 01:05:06,362
They found Marta
- What's Marta got to do with any of this?

451
01:05:06,416 --> 01:05:09,442
Hell if I know. They were at her place
- You didn't tell Martha, did you?

452
01:05:09,485 --> 01:05:11,851
Hell no. Shit man this is serious

453
01:05:12,855 --> 01:05:17,053
Drugs, drugs, it's gotta be drugs
- George is right

454
01:05:17,093 --> 01:05:19,709
There's something else
- This isn't about TV's

455
01:05:19,762 --> 01:05:23,766
There is now way that they would get this 
hired for some TV's, there's drugs in that truck

456
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:29,214
They were TV's, my Dad wouldn't lie to me
- Wake up idiots. We need to make an anonymous call 
and tell them where the truck is

457
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,232
Get out
- No, no fuckin' way. We didn't do all this for nothing

458
01:05:36,746 --> 01:05:38,964
We wait till tomorrow

459
01:05:39,015 --> 01:05:43,805
When it's light, less conspicuous.
We search the truck, take what we can carry

460
01:05:43,853 --> 01:05:46,538
leave the rest then
we make the call

461
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:49,228
If they get 90 percent of
their shit back, they're gonna be happy

462
01:05:49,259 --> 01:05:52,069
George is right, we can't walk 
out of this empty handed

463
01:05:52,662 --> 01:05:57,156
It's gonna be alright. So will Marta

463
01:06:00,662 --> 01:06:02,156
Hey Greg wait up

464
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:06,622
You're going home?

465
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:41,423
You've been sitting there all night
Not moving

466
01:07:41,437 --> 01:07:43,632
Are you dead or something?

467
01:07:45,675 --> 01:07:48,303
Come here a minute

468
01:07:54,817 --> 01:07:56,523
Sit

469
01:08:08,865 --> 01:08:13,393
Look Kat, I've got to ask you something
- If you've got something to ask, ask your sister

470
01:08:18,741 --> 01:08:22,097
She's sitting right next to me

471
01:08:23,346 --> 01:08:27,191
Yeah I guess she is.
Fire away

472
01:08:34,123 --> 01:08:37,832
Something happened to me last night

473
01:08:45,001 --> 01:08:48,732
It's like I was walking down this street

473
01:08:49,001 --> 01:08:52,732
That I knew really well and..

474
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:57,375
I didn't even have to look to where I was going

475
01:08:59,282 --> 01:09:02,649
And all of a sudden I've 
found myself somewhere I hadn't...

476
01:09:02,718 --> 01:09:06,108
I've never been before

477
01:09:07,156 --> 01:09:10,762
I feel like I've been there my
whole life

478
01:09:18,234 --> 01:09:21,271
And I wasn't afraid anymore

479
01:09:21,871 --> 01:09:24,624
What happened when you got there?

480
01:09:30,213 --> 01:09:32,283
Well...

481
01:09:34,984 --> 01:09:38,294
I kissed my best friend

482
01:09:38,921 --> 01:09:41,333
David

483
01:09:43,726 --> 01:09:46,240
On the mouth

484
01:09:49,065 --> 01:09:53,081
You know, the way mom and dad
do sometimes

485
01:10:03,412 --> 01:10:07,200
How come you don't like me?

486
01:10:09,519 --> 01:10:14,081
Not that I don't like you Cat, 
it's just you're a..

487
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:20,549
different..
from me, that's all

488
01:10:20,596 --> 01:10:23,372
Is that a bad thing?

489
01:10:25,501 --> 01:10:27,549
No

490
01:10:29,171 --> 01:10:31,822
I guess it's not

491
01:10:36,379 --> 01:10:39,405
Are you gonna kiss David again?

492
01:10:42,985 --> 01:10:45,783
I don't know

493
01:10:47,557 --> 01:10:49,946
Maybe

494
01:10:53,296 --> 01:10:57,221
What would you think about
having a brother like that?

495
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:49,834
You alright?

496
01:11:50,987 --> 01:11:56,243
- Look, if this is about last night
- It has nothing to do with you

497
01:11:56,292 --> 01:12:00,808
This is all shit
- The truck those guys are looking for

498
01:12:00,863 --> 01:12:04,026
We stole it.
- What?

499
01:12:04,967 --> 01:12:09,119
Welch Trucking Company, it's Davids' dad
- Jesus Christ

500
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:12,219
But I want you to know we're going to return it
We're gonna bring it back

501
01:12:15,177 --> 01:12:16,906
It'll be alright. We're gonna take care of it

502
01:12:16,946 --> 01:12:20,530
What's in the truck?
- Black market stuff

503
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:24,508
Televisons, I don't know
- You don't know anything

504
01:12:24,553 --> 01:12:26,202
We wanted to make some cash
I'm sorry you got involved

505
01:12:36,265 --> 01:12:38,381
Trust me

506
01:12:38,434 --> 01:12:40,834
We'll fix it

507
01:12:43,205 --> 01:12:45,548
We're gonna take care of it today

508
01:12:45,608 --> 01:12:49,009
High school punk

509
01:12:50,012 --> 01:12:52,469
Stop worrying

510
01:12:57,853 --> 01:12:59,730
I'm sorry

511
01:13:12,802 --> 01:13:16,624
I'm really sorry

512
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:02,715
Turn over

513
01:16:03,372 --> 01:16:06,091
Fratboy

514
01:17:01,196 --> 01:17:04,245
Wait

515
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:10,709
It hurts

516
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:53,146
I'm not going in that pool

517
01:18:29,084 --> 01:18:32,042
You're spending a little too much time
with that kid you can do better than that


517
01:18:32,084 --> 01:18:34,042
You're David Welch

518
01:18:34,289 --> 01:18:38,373
Yeah, I'm David Welch

519
01:18:39,361 --> 01:18:43,957
But Welch is a dirty word to 
some around here

520
01:18:43,999 --> 01:18:46,695
I got my credit card thrown
at my face, why is that?

521
01:18:46,735 --> 01:18:48,737
We all make enemies in this business

522
01:18:48,804 --> 01:18:52,228
What have you done?
- What have I done?

523
01:18:52,274 --> 01:18:56,802
Well, I paid the mortgage.
Sent you to an expensive university

524
01:18:56,845 --> 01:18:59,643
Brought you a new truck

525
01:19:02,351 --> 01:19:05,127
We used to tell each other everything

526
01:19:05,654 --> 01:19:07,372
Yeah

527
01:19:08,924 --> 01:19:11,222
There was a time when we did

528
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:14,252
No secrets

529
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:21,712
What change between us...

530
01:19:28,277 --> 01:19:32,179
Why don't you go on and give
George a ride home now

531
01:19:32,848 --> 01:19:36,329
Dad, there's something I need to tell you
- Please, don't

532
01:19:36,385 --> 01:19:40,674
Its this that conversation where the son
says to the father, "Guess what Dad, I'm a fag"

533
01:19:43,358 --> 01:19:46,748
Well, if that's what you want

534
01:19:48,063 --> 01:19:50,770
It's not a problem for me

535
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:55,088
But you could at least fuck somebody
whose got some class

536
01:19:55,137 --> 01:19:58,755
George is dead end.
What could he ever do for you?

537
01:20:00,943 --> 01:20:04,811
George knows who I am

538
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:07,793
Do you know what that feels like?

539
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:12,287
To have somebody to look at you
and know who you are and what you want

540
01:20:12,321 --> 01:20:16,485
It's like waking up over and over again

541
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:20,167
And ever sine mom died you pushed me aside

542
01:20:20,195 --> 01:20:23,119
I've never pushed you aside

543
01:20:23,165 --> 01:20:25,599
I've pushed you to the top

544
01:20:26,168 --> 01:20:30,172
I don't want you to be like me David
- That would've been enough, to be like you

545
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:34,403
I want you to be better than me!
- See that's the difference

546
01:20:34,443 --> 01:20:37,162
I've always loved you
just as you are

547
01:20:37,179 --> 01:20:40,433
And you've only fuckin' loved me
for how you want me to be

548
01:21:08,844 --> 01:21:12,336
Cool, it looks like George

549
01:21:14,483 --> 01:21:17,190
No, I understand perfectly Roger

550
01:21:18,187 --> 01:21:21,679
No, of course

551
01:21:21,723 --> 01:21:24,009
Of course!

552
01:21:26,828 --> 01:21:31,253
You've got papers on all the goods in the truck?
- Yeah, I've got paperwork there on the desk

553
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:34,849
For 500 bucks is a children's toys

554
01:21:34,903 --> 01:21:37,201
Very cute. It's too cheap in Mexico

555
01:21:37,239 --> 01:21:40,811
These are routine questions for a theft Mr. Welch,
I'm just doing my job

556
01:21:40,842 --> 01:21:44,084
Well do your job Lane and watch my back

557
01:21:44,146 --> 01:21:49,220
Maybe if you've done a little better watching
my back, we wouldn't have this God awful fuck up right now!

558
01:21:56,625 --> 01:22:00,265
Shit, I thought you said he was coming alone?

559
01:22:03,699 --> 01:22:06,418
What the hell did you bring her for?
- Cause I know what assholes you are

560
01:22:07,002 --> 01:22:08,845
Fuck you

561
01:22:08,904 --> 01:22:10,883
Go home, we can take care of this

562
01:22:12,641 --> 01:22:15,236
Have you ever seen how white
a knee cap is when it breaks the skin?

563
01:22:15,278 --> 01:22:18,280
I have! And that's just for starters
These people will hurt you

564
01:22:18,347 --> 01:22:21,989
Do you even know what's in there?
- Yeah, drugs and TV's

565
01:22:22,018 --> 01:22:23,792
We're taking some of both and
then we're gonna split

566
01:22:23,853 --> 01:22:28,471
I had a friend who helped himself when no one was 
looking and after they crippled him, they put a knife in his gut

567
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:32,756
Shut your mouth, my father is no killer
- You don't know what he is

568
01:22:34,596 --> 01:22:37,178
I am not leaving empty handed

569
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,429
George don't!

570
01:23:02,424 --> 01:23:06,281
Oh my god
- What the fuck?

571
01:24:31,546 --> 01:24:33,616
You gotta leave

572
01:24:33,648 --> 01:24:36,173
You gotta go now.
Come on Greg

573
01:24:39,888 --> 01:24:42,436
No, I'm staying

574
01:24:55,036 --> 01:24:56,981
I know, I know

575
01:24:57,038 --> 01:25:00,826
We'll get the stuff and drive the container out
into the dessert and dump it

576
01:25:00,842 --> 01:25:04,209
Yeah, burn everything

577
01:25:04,246 --> 01:25:07,738
No, I'll talk to the boys.
I'll see they understand

578
01:25:07,783 --> 01:25:11,241
Listen to me Roger
I'm the one whose gonna deal with this

579
01:25:11,286 --> 01:25:14,756
Roger I got enough on you, I warn you

580
01:25:17,259 --> 01:25:20,092
You're gonna burn those?

581
01:25:20,128 --> 01:25:23,382
Well I don't give a fuck about them right now.
I'm gonna get my son out there

582
01:25:23,432 --> 01:25:28,222
And no one else counts? What about those people?
It's all just business to you?

583
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:30,249
Stop your moral bullshit please

584
01:25:30,772 --> 01:25:35,072
I'm the one who gets them the shitty jobs and 
the packhouse in Iowa and sometimes things go wrong

585
01:25:35,977 --> 01:25:40,528
But you risk nothing!
- I risk everything that was important to me a long time ago

586
01:25:41,783 --> 01:25:44,957
So you really think you can get away with this?

587
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:58,363
Don't burn them!

588
01:26:00,202 --> 01:26:03,706
What are we gonna do?
- Shut up I'll figure something out

589
01:26:03,738 --> 01:26:05,753
It was your father's cargo.
Why didn't you know what was in there?

590
01:26:05,808 --> 01:26:08,560
How could I know?

591
01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:11,067
Over and over again I asked him, he wouldn't tell me...

592
01:26:11,079 --> 01:26:13,776
We killed them!
- I told you to shut up

592
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:16,776
Jesus we killed them

593
01:26:17,085 --> 01:26:18,928
They must have been shouting!

594
01:26:21,428 --> 01:26:25,316
To die like that? In the dark...

594
01:26:26,128 --> 01:26:28,316
No one knew

595
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:31,332
We gotta bury them

596
01:26:31,366 --> 01:26:34,620
They had families.
They had names

597
01:27:08,704 --> 01:27:10,319
Where's George?

598
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:28,086
David get in the car.
Shut up I know what happened

599
01:27:28,123 --> 01:27:30,921
George, you two take his truck and follow me

600
01:27:30,959 --> 01:27:33,371
What about the semi?
- They're gonna burn the semi. We're gonna clean up this mess

601
01:27:33,395 --> 01:27:36,171
David you've got to get in the car
Boys get in the truck we don't have much time

602
01:27:36,231 --> 01:27:38,324
David...

603
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,552
Who the fuck is that?
- Dad?

604
01:27:40,571 --> 01:27:44,482
You think I ran this game on my own?
Get in the car.

605
01:27:44,539 --> 01:27:46,734
David, what's going on?

606
01:27:46,775 --> 01:27:49,380
No, you can't burn them
- Cmon. Get in the goddamn car

607
01:27:49,444 --> 01:27:51,446
You can't just burn them!

608
01:27:51,479 --> 01:27:56,678
- I planned it Dad. It was me, 
I was the one who planned the whole thing
- I don't care just move it

609
01:27:57,519 --> 01:28:00,738
We need to tell the cops.
If he won't, I will

610
01:28:00,789 --> 01:28:03,087
You're not getting away with this
- Don't you dare threaten me you son of a bitch!

611
01:28:03,124 --> 01:28:05,945
I will put you in the truck with 
the rest of them. One less wetback to deal with.

612
01:28:13,301 --> 01:28:15,747
Get in the car!

613
01:28:17,839 --> 01:28:20,694
Give me the gun
- No secrets right Dad?

614
01:28:20,742 --> 01:28:22,801
No secrets between us

615
01:28:22,811 --> 01:28:24,722
You son of a bitch!

616
01:28:24,779 --> 01:28:28,966
If you trusted me. If you've told me the truth

617
01:28:29,017 --> 01:28:32,737
Stop! Stay where you are goddamnit!

618
01:28:32,787 --> 01:28:37,850
We killed them! We fuckin' killed them

619
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,121
Please

620
01:28:43,365 --> 01:28:45,833
David! Fuck

621
01:28:47,469 --> 01:28:49,608
Oh god

622
01:28:51,172 --> 01:28:54,050
Get the fuck away from me.
Don't touch me

623
01:28:57,979 --> 01:29:00,368
I'm so sorry

624
01:29:01,349 --> 01:29:03,442
Sorry?

625
01:29:03,485 --> 01:29:06,841
You're sorry? Is that what you're going to say
to those dead fucks?

626
01:29:06,888 --> 01:29:08,901
Well you know what I am?
I'm one of them

627
01:29:08,957 --> 01:29:12,427
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down or I'll shoot

628
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:15,258
I'm one of them now!
Cmon!

629
01:29:15,296 --> 01:29:17,150
Fuck you!

630
01:29:20,068 --> 01:29:22,787
You put the gun down or I'll shoot

631
01:29:48,563 --> 01:29:50,167
Fuck you!

632
01:30:26,468 --> 01:30:28,186
We need help!

633
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:32,945
We need help down here!
