364
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,710
Hot, though.

365
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,170
You fuck her?

366
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,140
No.

367
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,610

00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,390
Mm hm.

369
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:50,810
Not hard enough
though, obviously.

370
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:51,790
She had a boyfriend.

371
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,430
So?

372
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,640
Did she want you?

00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,970
Yeah, you did.

374
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,730
Yeah, she did.

375
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:03,950
Does she have a boyfriend now?

376

Ben, serious, I'll tell
you what you should do.

All right, go over there,
with your uh, sexy mustache

And cigarette a-dangling.

Go over there, in the
direction of Summer Day.

384
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,470
And just put your
arm around her.

385

You don't even have
to introduce yourself.

386
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,510
Just... just do it.

387
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,860
She knows who you are.

388
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,800
Pretty soon, uh, we got a
couple of cuddle bunnies

389
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,130
In the corner of the party.

390
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,890
Step two, take her
out in the woods.

391
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,590
Mm.

392
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,560
Find a nice little path.

393
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,810
Let her lead, though.

394
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:01,600
It's kind of creepy...
Which is better.

395
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,270
Because then when you don't
murder her, it'll build trust.

396
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,590
All right, so find a nice
spot out in the woods.

397
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:18,100
And start kissing on her.

398
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,430
You which part to kiss?

399
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,490
The base of her neck.

400
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,190
You know why?

401
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,090
That's where they
got the peach fuzz.

402
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,040
And at this moment,
you should run

403
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:44,690
Your hand real
slowly up her thigh.

404
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:50,300
Underneath her dress.

405
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:56,200
Just take your
hands, and just kind

406
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,550
Of shove it up into her asshole.

407

in and out like that.

poo like a pigeon.

I guarantee you.

Yeah, I'm gonna go...

417
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,240
Get her.
