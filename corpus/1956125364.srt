Good. I haven't seen you

I want-- I want to see you.

To be totally clear, just 'cause
I don't wanna... do this.

in having a threesome,

also interested in this.

complete respect.

interested in

are different.

about that, if that's okay.

We-- No, we...

We're having dinner, and
maybe you could be there,

each other better.

to dinner,

I, uh...

1031
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:37,023
- Are you...
- I'm being weird, yeah.

1032
00:52:37,066 --> 00:52:39,591
I'm telling you that I'm being
weird right now.

1033
00:52:39,634 --> 00:52:41,419
I'm trying to, like,
get...

1034
00:52:41,462 --> 00:52:43,160
gear myself up to
tell you something

1035
00:52:43,203 --> 00:52:44,639
that's kind of uncomfortable.

1036
00:52:44,683 --> 00:52:49,166
So I'm just... kind of
in my head about it.

1037
00:52:49,209 --> 00:52:52,691
That's all.

1038
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:56,695
Are you good or...

1039
00:52:56,738 --> 00:52:58,305
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1040
00:52:58,349 --> 00:53:02,135
Yeah. Um... Can we, like--
Can we get up from here?

1041
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,225
I feel kind of stiff right now
at this table,

1042
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:06,879
and I would love to, like...

1043
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:08,620
- Yeah.
- Can we go in there?

1044
00:53:08,663 --> 00:53:10,012
Yeah.

1045
00:53:10,056 --> 00:53:12,014
I kinda just wanna, like,
get up, move...

1046
00:53:12,058 --> 00:53:13,277
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

1047
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,496
My blood...

1048
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,064
Do you want, like,
a drink or something or...

1049
00:53:18,107 --> 00:53:19,892
Yeah, do you have any more
of those water bottles?

1050
00:53:19,935 --> 00:53:21,241
Can I get a water bottle?

1051
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:22,938
Thanks.

1052
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:28,901
Sorry. Sorry that I'm
being like this.

1053
00:53:28,944 --> 00:53:30,511
No, are you okay?

1054
00:53:30,555 --> 00:53:33,340
Yeah. Yes. No, I'm okay.
You don't have to freak out.

1055
00:53:33,384 --> 00:53:36,300
I'm not gonna tell you that
I have, like, an STD.

1056
00:53:36,343 --> 00:53:37,910
Okay, good, 'cause I...
yeah.

1057
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:39,781
- Whatever. Um...
- Okay.

1058
00:53:45,396 --> 00:53:49,791
I got, uh, I got really
turned on the other night

1059
00:53:49,835 --> 00:53:52,054
when were in the threesome.

1060
00:53:52,098 --> 00:53:53,360
- The threesome?
- Yeah.

1061
00:53:53,404 --> 00:53:55,754
I got really turned on...

1062
00:53:55,797 --> 00:53:58,670
um, by you crying.

1063
00:53:58,713 --> 00:54:02,021
And I feel like
I have to say that.

1064
00:54:02,064 --> 00:54:05,067
Because it's all that
I've been thinking about.

1065
00:54:05,111 --> 00:54:06,939
And I, like--
I can't.

1066
00:54:06,982 --> 00:54:09,376
I literally can't get it
out of my head.

1067
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,032
And I don't really know
what to do about that.

1068
00:54:13,075 --> 00:54:14,990
So I just have
to tell you that.

1069
00:54:15,034 --> 00:54:17,254
- Oh, uh...
- That's all.

1070
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:19,473
- Huh. That's so weird.
- Yeah.

1071
00:54:19,517 --> 00:54:21,301
I mean, it's not weird,

1072
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:23,869
but I would never have thought
that would have been a turn-on.

1073
00:54:23,912 --> 00:54:27,786
It's kind of...
a little creepy.

1074
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:32,051
Yeah, it is.
[chuckles]

1075
00:54:32,094 --> 00:54:34,923
- Because it is creepy.
- It is creepy, right?

1076
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:36,360
- Oh, the crying?
- Yeah.

1077
00:54:36,403 --> 00:54:38,187
No, no, no, the crying
wasn't creepy.

1078
00:54:38,231 --> 00:54:40,277
I feel creepy.
I feel creepy.

1079
00:54:41,843 --> 00:54:45,194
- Why?
- 'Cause I, um...

1080
00:54:45,238 --> 00:54:48,372
I got really turned on,
sexually,

1081
00:54:48,415 --> 00:54:52,419
and I was also really moved
emotionally,

1082
00:54:52,463 --> 00:54:56,380
and I had never felt those
two things together before.

1083
00:54:56,423 --> 00:54:59,252
And I felt those two things
together for the first time,

1084
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,472
and it kinda blew
my fucking mind,

1085
00:55:01,515 --> 00:55:03,648
and that's kinda all...

1086
00:55:03,691 --> 00:55:06,738
I have this image that I can't
get out of my head right now.

1087
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:11,743
Um, and it's me and you,
and, um...

1088
00:55:11,786 --> 00:55:14,006
And I'm, uh, I'm-I'm...

1089
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:16,617
I start by I'm sucking
on your nipples.

1090
00:55:16,661 --> 00:55:19,751
Um, and...

1091
00:55:19,794 --> 00:55:23,450
Um, I-I like, work my way
down to your pussy,

1092
00:55:23,494 --> 00:55:25,974
and, um...

1093
00:55:26,018 --> 00:55:28,586
I, uh, and I call you "Mommy."

1094
00:55:28,629 --> 00:55:30,457
And I'm, like...

1095
00:55:30,501 --> 00:55:33,852
I'm, like, nestled
into your pussy, and, um...

1096
00:55:33,895 --> 00:55:35,941
and I'm, like, crying
and I'm saying,

1097
00:55:35,984 --> 00:55:38,291
"Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,
I'm so sorry."

1098
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,858
It was like I did
something wrong,

1099
00:55:39,901 --> 00:55:43,862
and you're beating my head,
um, to, like, punish me.

1100
00:55:43,905 --> 00:55:45,994
And, um, I'm like...

1101
00:55:46,038 --> 00:55:48,127
And then we fuck.

1102
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,694
And I call you "Mommy"
the whole time,

1103
00:55:49,737 --> 00:55:51,435
and I'm, like, talking
in a baby voice.

1104
00:55:51,478 --> 00:55:52,958
And it... you know...

1105
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:56,178
This is kinda...
This is kinda weird actually.

1106
00:55:56,222 --> 00:56:00,052
Because I have this weird,
uh...

1107
00:56:00,095 --> 00:56:02,315
I have this biz...

1108
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,186
I'm kinda embarrassed
to say this,

1109
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:08,365
but I have this weird
fantasy about, uh...

1110
00:56:08,408 --> 00:56:11,542
having these enormous breasts.

1111
00:56:11,585 --> 00:56:13,457
- Huh.
- And...

1112
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,373
But they're filled with
so much milk.

1113
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:19,985
And... you know...

1114
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:21,813
You're just sucking on them

1115
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:25,382
and drinking all the milk
from them.

1116
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:29,298
You mean me? I? Me?
Or just, like, a person?

1117
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:31,431
Well, I guess it was anybody,

1118
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:34,695
but, you know, it's interesting
that you have this...

1119
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:38,220
Yeah.

1120
00:56:38,264 --> 00:56:41,093
And then you're kind of,
like--

1121
00:56:41,136 --> 00:56:43,138
I guess I have to sort of
take care of you,

1122
00:56:43,182 --> 00:56:45,010
and you're just drinking
my milk,

1123
00:56:45,053 --> 00:56:46,664
but you're, like, my baby,

1124
00:56:46,707 --> 00:56:48,883
and I'm comforting you
and you're crying.

1125
00:56:48,927 --> 00:56:52,278
But simultaneously, we're both
kinda of getting off.

1126
00:56:52,321 --> 00:56:54,976
I don't know if we're
rubbing each other

1127
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,848
or what's happening.

1128
00:56:56,891 --> 00:56:59,459
- Oh, my God.
- [laughing]

1129
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:06,597
Um...
that's fucking awesome.

1130
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,599
That's really cool.
That's like what I said.

1131
00:57:08,642 --> 00:57:09,948
Holy shit.

1132
00:57:09,991 --> 00:57:11,776
- That sounds really...
- This is...

1133
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:14,996
That sounds really fucked up,
but it sounds really hot to me.

1134
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,781
- I know. Why?
- I don't know why.

1135
00:57:16,824 --> 00:57:19,610
I don't know. But I don't
have big breasts.

1136
00:57:19,653 --> 00:57:21,742
- You have great boobs?
- Do I have?

1137
00:57:21,786 --> 00:57:23,222
You haven't seen them, though.

1138
00:57:23,265 --> 00:57:26,181
I saw them through your dress
the other night.

1139
00:57:26,225 --> 00:57:27,574
You saw them through
my dress?

1140
00:57:27,618 --> 00:57:28,880
I don't know. I mean,
I get the picture.

1141
00:57:28,923 --> 00:57:30,403
They're great.
You have good tits.

1142
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,144
I don't have to see them
to know that.

1143
00:57:32,187 --> 00:57:34,233
They're not a terrible...

1144
00:57:34,276 --> 00:57:36,583
They're kinda cute,
I guess.

1145
00:57:36,627 --> 00:57:39,368
But in that fantasy,
they're these kinda like

1146
00:57:39,412 --> 00:57:42,502
big, fat tits,
you know?

1147
00:57:44,243 --> 00:57:45,462
- Can I...
- Will you...

1148
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:47,376
maybe...

1149
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:50,771
like, just...

1150
00:57:50,815 --> 00:57:52,686
I don't know. Do you wanna
touch them, maybe?

1151
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:54,471
Yeah, I do.

1152
00:58:06,918 --> 00:58:09,964
- Can I--
- Can you pretend they're big?

1153
00:58:10,008 --> 00:58:12,358
I don't have to,
they're great.

1154
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:15,579
I know, but I kind of
love big boobs.

1155
00:58:15,622 --> 00:58:17,015
Isn't that weird?

1156
00:58:17,058 --> 00:58:19,191
No, I can pretend
they're big, yeah.

1157
00:58:19,234 --> 00:58:21,193
Can I, um...

1158
00:58:21,236 --> 00:58:24,239
Will you go down...
Will you go down here?

1159
00:58:24,283 --> 00:58:26,024
Yeah, so I'll go...

1160
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:28,113
I'm gonna sit right here.

1161
00:58:28,156 --> 00:58:29,941
I'm gonna come--
I'm gonna go down there.

1162
00:58:29,984 --> 00:58:31,203
You're gonna go
down here.

1163
00:58:31,246 --> 00:58:32,378
Okay.

1164
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:34,772
And...

1165
00:58:34,815 --> 00:58:37,905
I guess you can just start
by...

1166
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:40,125
touching my boobs.

1167
00:58:40,168 --> 00:58:41,518
Okay.

1168
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:43,650
We'll just go slowly.

1169
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:46,740
You can touch my boobs,
and then you can

1170
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:49,961
kind of mush them together
a little bit.

1171
00:58:50,004 --> 00:58:52,224
Yeah, like that.

1172
00:58:52,267 --> 00:58:54,618
Ah, that feels good.

1173
00:58:54,661 --> 00:58:57,925
Will you, maybe,
drink the milk?

1174
00:58:57,969 --> 00:59:03,017
- Can I call you Mommy?
- Yeah, you call me Mommy.

1175
00:59:03,061 --> 00:59:05,280
- Ah!
- Mommy. Mommy.

1176
00:59:05,324 --> 00:59:06,804
Oh.

1177
00:59:06,847 --> 00:59:10,111
Mommy, can I have
more milk, please?

1178
00:59:10,155 --> 00:59:11,809
Ohh, drink the milk.

1179
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:13,332
Drink the milk.
Keep going.

1180
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:16,291
- Mommy?
- Grab this one while you do it.

1181
00:59:16,335 --> 00:59:18,990
- Am I in trouble?
- No, you've been a good boy.

1182
00:59:19,033 --> 00:59:20,818
Say that I'm in trouble.

1183
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:23,560
You're in trouble.
You've been a bad boy.

1184
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:25,866
I'm sorry, Mommy!
I'm sorry!

1185
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:29,043
Will you grab my back while you do it?
And just suck my nipple harder.

1186
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:30,828
Mmm, that's good.

1187
00:59:30,871 --> 00:59:32,786
Mommy?

1188
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:36,747
Keep calling me Mommy.
You've been a bad boy.

01:00:07,778 --> 01:00:10,737
I felt like there was static
in the communication.

1199
01:00:10,781 --> 01:00:14,654
And I wanted to come over here
and clear the air.

1200
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:17,178
You know?
And look, man, I...

1201
01:00:17,222 --> 01:00:20,791
I've been kind of
a jerk lately.

1202
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:23,707
And I wanted to come over
and apologize for that.

1203
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,013
What's... what's that
on your head, man?

1204
01:00:26,057 --> 01:00:27,624
Is that a baby's bonnet?

1205
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:28,973
[laughs]
Yeah!

1206
01:00:29,016 --> 01:00:30,801
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1207
01:00:30,844 --> 01:00:33,281
Oh, yeah, she's got all these
little random things,

1208
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:35,283
like, lying around
the house.

1209
01:00:35,327 --> 01:00:37,372
And, uh, I threw it on
my head as a joke.

1210
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:40,506
I was like, "Whaaa!
I'm a little baby!"

1211
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:42,116
Cool, man.

1212
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,465
Hey!

1213
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:46,033
Hi!

1214
01:00:46,077 --> 01:00:47,426
Come on in!

1215
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:52,910
So I've been spending
kinda the past day

1216
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:54,694
thinking about what this is.

1217
01:00:54,738 --> 01:00:56,914
Like... is it real?

1218
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:59,046
I feel like we jumped into this
thing really fast.

1219
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,918
But I-I-I just...

1220
01:01:00,961 --> 01:01:02,571
I haven't been able to get you
out of my head.

1221
01:01:02,615 --> 01:01:05,966
And whether it's too fast
or not,

1222
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:07,359
that doesn't matter to me.

1223
01:01:07,402 --> 01:01:08,969
I think that this is...

1224
01:01:09,013 --> 01:01:11,711
This is real enough for me.

1225
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:14,975
It's the realist thing
I've ever felt.

1226
01:01:15,019 --> 01:01:17,195
And so, you know,

1227
01:01:17,238 --> 01:01:19,893
before we discuss either
the threesome or whatever,

1228
01:01:19,937 --> 01:01:22,983
I just wanna, like...

1229
01:01:23,027 --> 01:01:26,291
I wrote a song, and I wanna
share it with you, so...

1230
01:01:26,334 --> 01:01:28,728
[clears throat]

1231
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:31,252
This is my grandfather's
guitar,

1232
01:01:31,296 --> 01:01:35,648
and he bought it when
he married my grandmother.

1233
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,389
Um, so...

1234
01:01:37,432 --> 01:01:39,696
he let me borrow it
for this.

1235
01:01:41,959 --> 01:01:44,222
[strumming loudly]

1236
01:01:51,664 --> 01:01:52,665
Hold on.

1237
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,885

1245
01:02:18,865 --> 01:02:20,954
Like, I'm getting--
I feel like I'm getting

1246
01:02:20,998 --> 01:02:23,522

Oh, that's fine.
It's, I mean, wow.

01:02:28,353 --> 01:02:32,183
The way I feel, I feel is
not getting through in the song.

1249
01:02:32,226 --> 01:02:34,141
It's amazing.

I'm right here.

1251
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:41,627

a cappella.

1252
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:43,716
Yeah, okay.

1253
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,457

1261
01:03:18,142 --> 01:03:20,013
one with nature,
and I'm like...

1262
01:03:20,057 --> 01:03:22,537
this is an important time.

1263
01:03:22,581 --> 01:03:24,017
I'm gonna sing a great song.

1264
01:03:24,061 --> 01:03:26,237
And so I came up with it,
and there it was.

1265
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,369
- It's really beautiful.
- Thank you.

1266
01:03:28,413 --> 01:03:31,416
- You're really beautiful.
- Aw, thanks.

1267
01:03:31,459 --> 01:03:35,028
So, uh, I think I found
the perfect spot, guys.

1268
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:37,161
Front and center.

1269
01:03:37,204 --> 01:03:38,684
Let's get you guys
married, huh?

1270
01:03:38,727 --> 01:03:41,165
Oh, my gosh! We're doing this.
This is wild.

1271
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:43,558
Shoot, it's only
15 minute parking.

1272
01:03:43,602 --> 01:03:45,996
Um, why don't we...
why don't we just jump out,

1273
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:48,259
and you can cruise
down the block,

1274
01:03:48,302 --> 01:03:50,957
and we can meet you out,
down at a coffee shop

1275
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:52,306
or something
in a little bit?

1276
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,265
You know what?
I'll go down the block.

1277
01:03:54,308 --> 01:03:55,832
I'll get hour parking
down there,

1278
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:57,355
and then we'll all
go in together.

1279
01:03:57,398 --> 01:03:59,618
Oh, I don't think there's
hour parking here.

1280
01:03:59,661 --> 01:04:01,402
- There's--
- What do you mean?

1281
01:04:01,446 --> 01:04:02,926
I don't know.
My friend just lives here,

1282
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:05,102
and she said there wasn't
any hour parking.

1283
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:07,495
She lives right over there.

1284
01:04:07,539 --> 01:04:10,194
And I know that she doesn't
ever get parking for an hour.

1285
01:04:10,237 --> 01:04:12,109
Maybe there's, like,
a special

1286
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:14,067
"People that are getting
married" parking area?

1287
01:04:14,111 --> 01:04:15,373
That seems weird.

1288
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:16,983
Well, let's just drive
around the block

1289
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:18,898
and get a little parking
and then--

1290
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:20,552
'Cause we wanna
walk in together.

1291
01:04:20,595 --> 01:04:21,901
You've got your best man.

1292
01:04:21,945 --> 01:04:23,772
I think it's probably best
if you just

1293
01:04:23,816 --> 01:04:25,339
drive down the block,

1294
01:04:25,383 --> 01:04:28,603
and you can do some loops
around the block, and...

1295
01:04:28,647 --> 01:04:30,388
It's okay if the car
gets towed.

1296
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:33,260
I will pay for the tow.
I will take care of it.

1297
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:34,522
I'm happy to do it.

1298
01:04:34,566 --> 01:04:35,915
I wanna get out of the car.

1299
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:37,482
I feel really uncomfortable
right now.

1300
01:04:37,525 --> 01:04:39,179
I'm just...
getting burnt.

1301
01:04:39,223 --> 01:04:41,355
[Isaac] You'll just be my best
man from the car, I guess.

1302
01:04:41,399 --> 01:04:43,444
I mean, it's fine.
We'll be in and out, man.

1303
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:51,365
That's a really good idea,
you guys.

1304
01:04:53,019 --> 01:04:56,240
Go ahead. Go in there.
I'll be here.

1305
01:04:56,283 --> 01:05:00,157
- All right. We'll be right out.
- Bye.

1306
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:04,726

And we'll have, like,
the fucking thing--

1312
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:22,396
I feel like the crib should be--
The window, you know?

1313
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,181
If it rains or something?

1314
01:05:24,224 --> 01:05:26,792
No, I mean, just 'cause
it's kind of a pretty view.

1315
01:05:26,835 --> 01:05:28,881
- Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I don't wanna block it.

I just feel, like, this room
has more potential

1317
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,885
than just, like,
a giant closet.

1318
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,932
What do we wanna do with this
pile of clothes over here?

1319
01:05:35,975 --> 01:05:38,151
I think we should
keep that there.

1320
01:05:38,195 --> 01:05:40,110
Um, we should just...

1321
01:05:40,153 --> 01:05:43,504
put all the rest of the clothes
over there?

1322
01:05:43,548 --> 01:05:45,811
- Hey.
- What?

1323
01:05:45,854 --> 01:05:47,900
This can be, like,
a fun thing.

1324

- Okay, yeah.
- All right?

1325

This is, like, a good thing.

No, you're acting, like,
stressed out.

1328
01:05:54,124 --> 01:05:55,821
Stressed out?
Oh, I'm sorry.

1329

We got Charlie coming
over here soon.

1330
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:01,740
We got Charlie coming over.

1331
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:03,220
We're gonna have
some dinner.

1332
01:06:03,263 --> 01:06:04,482
Yeah.

1333
01:06:04,525 --> 01:06:06,049
Hey. This is, like,
a really--

1334
01:06:06,092 --> 01:06:08,138
- This is a cool thing.
- I know.

1335
01:06:08,181 --> 01:06:10,705
We're clearing out,
like, our kid's room.

1336
01:06:10,749 --> 01:06:11,968
Mm.

1337
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:13,708
God.

1338
01:06:13,752 --> 01:06:15,667
It's, like, our baby's room.

1339
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:17,408
[whispering]
Holy shit.

1340
01:06:17,451 --> 01:06:19,714
You just know that you have
certain pets,

1341
01:06:19,758 --> 01:06:21,586
and then you can
train the pets

1342
01:06:21,629 --> 01:06:25,024
to have different abilities.

1343
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:26,721
And you can buy them
weapons and stuff.

1344
01:06:26,765 --> 01:06:28,854
Like, I had this one
neo-pet

1345
01:06:28,897 --> 01:06:31,683
that was like a dragon
that had a sword,

1346
01:06:31,726 --> 01:06:35,078
and it was like the most powerful
sword that you could have.

1347
01:06:35,121 --> 01:06:36,993
I wish I retained
some of it.

1348
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:38,255
It just feels like I spent--

1349
01:06:38,298 --> 01:06:40,474
We spent, like,
$200,000 on school,

1350
01:06:40,518 --> 01:06:42,607
and I don't know fucking
anything about bonobos

1351
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,217
or monkeys or anything.

1352
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:46,306
- [chuckles] Bonobos.
- What?

1353
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:48,787
She was a bonobo specialist.
I don't know shit about them.

1354
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:51,790
She's, like, the queen of
the bonobos

1355
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:53,313
among the humans
in the world.

1356
01:06:53,357 --> 01:06:54,706
She was great, man.

1357
01:06:54,749 --> 01:06:56,142
And the books that
she assigned us to read

1358
01:06:56,186 --> 01:06:57,883
were all books that, like,

1359
01:06:57,926 --> 01:07:00,929
actually made me feel
really good.

1360
01:07:00,973 --> 01:07:02,714
You know, they weren't just
stupid textbooks,

1361
01:07:02,757 --> 01:07:04,846
they were the kind of books
you'd read

1362
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,979
if you were, like,
on mushrooms.

1363
01:07:09,895 --> 01:07:11,505
Did we get that
chocolate cake?

1364
01:07:11,549 --> 01:07:13,594
Mm-hmm. You want me to
