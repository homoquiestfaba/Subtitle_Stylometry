1
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:14,557
(gentle festive music)

2
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,020
- Not all dogs shed.

3
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,813
Most dogs even have
really clean mouths,

4
00:00:20,897 --> 00:00:22,982
even cleaner than ours.

5
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,775
- If we still had
the downtown office,

6
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,110
we could park in
the lot, but no,

7
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,655
Glenn's decided to move the
whole operation to the suburbs.

8
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:30,407
- You can even teach dogs
to bring in the papers

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,033
so you'd never have to
leave your chair, Dad.

10
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:34,452
- There's an empty space,

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,245
here we go, here we go!

12
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,830
Ah, for crying out loud!

13
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:41,083
They oughta ban
foreign compact cars.

14
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:42,543
- Why don't you just
park in the lot.

15
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:45,463
- (sighing) For
$8? Are you crazy?

16
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:48,883
You know, the city says it's
free to go ice skating, okay?

17
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,885
The prices of hot chocolate
are inflated twice

18
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,678
that of market value,
and, and, and ice skating

19
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:55,932
rental fees are outrageous,
and they want $8 for parking?

20
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,350
Not from this buckaroo.

21
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:58,852
- You show 'em, Dave.

22
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:00,520
Now listen, I'm putting
all the boys downstairs

23
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:01,897
together in sleeping bags

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,565
so they can beat each other
senseless for all I care.

25
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:05,858
I swear I've never seen those
boys not punching each other.

26
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:07,318
- Now, who's in charge
of laying out this city?

27
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:08,570
That's what I'd like to know.

28
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:09,987
There's not a single
place to park anywhere.

29
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,572
- I put Matt and Carol
in the blue room.

30
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,407
Oh, and don't mention that
Carol's turning 50 this year.

31
00:01:13,492 --> 00:01:14,992
She's very sensitive to that.

32
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:15,993
Oh, and do you happen to know

33
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,537
what Daryl got Anna
this year for Christmas?

34
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,038
Last year, he got
her tube socks,

35
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:20,623
so I went ahead
and sent an email

36
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:22,375
to make sure that
doesn't happen again.

37
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,002
- Look at this guy!

38
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,378
He's way over the line.
He's taking up two spaces!

39
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,632
- Dave, are, are
you listening to me?

40
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:30,883
- Yeah, that's fine.

41
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:31,927
- Did you know that
houses with dogs

42
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,637
are 11% less likely
to be broken into?

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,930
It's a fact, I read it.

44
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:38,850
- I passed this lady
three times now,

45
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,393
and she's still going
through her purse.

46
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,938
Back out, let
somebody else park!

47
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:46,190
You can go through your
purse when you get home.

48
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:52,113
- I wish you would just park
the car so we can go downtown.

49
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,990
- Well, I'm trying
to park the car.

50
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,700
I've been trying to park the
car for half an hour now.

51
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,077
- Just park it already.

52
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:00,997
- Ah-ha, ah-ha!

53
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:03,958
What's that? You see that?

54
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,042
You see that, Kassandra?

55
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,252
What do you think of that, huh?

56
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,588
- [Kassandra] That's great, Dad.

57
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:09,922
- Well, you might
not think so now,

58
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,883
but one day when you go to
college, you'll say to yourself,

59
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,010
I'm here because Dad
knew how to save a buck.

60
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:18,430
- [Kassandra] Alison
just got a dog.

61
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:20,267
It's all I want for
Christmas, and I was thinking.

62
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,935
- [Sandy] Kassandra,
we've talked about this.

63
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:24,103
- [Kassandra] But I
would take care of it!

64
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:25,647
- Did you see this guy?

65
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,940
- [Sandy] We're not
getting a dog, Kassandra.

66
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:27,773
We've talked about this.

67
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,358
A dog is a big deal.

68
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:31,402
- Are you blind?
I'm parking here.

69
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:33,947
Can you believe this guy?

70
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:37,075
Unbelievable.

71
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:40,077
- Hey dummy, don't you
see I have my blinker on?

72
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,328
- Jerry!

73
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:42,955
- What'd you call me?

74
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,123
- You heard me.

75
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:46,000
- Oh, who cares, just
let him have his spot!

76
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,252
- Let him, let
him have the spot?

77
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,297
What, oh no, look at this,
he's trying to inch up.

78
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,798
Oh no, you don't.

79
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,052
- He's trying to inch back.

80
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:57,928
I don't believe this.

81
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,638
- (gasps) Dave!

82
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:00,890
- He just hit me!

83
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:01,640
- Oh, can we-
- You all saw it!

84
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,975
He just hit me.

85
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,518
- Dave, can we please just
go park in the garage!

86
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,853
- You just caused an
accident, you imbecile!

87
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,982
- Jerry, what are you doing?

88
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,275
- He doesn't wanna move the car?

89
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,735
I'll move it for him.

90
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,987
(cars thudding)
- Dave, oh my gosh!

91
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,655
Oh my gosh, he's pushing on us!

92
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,823
- [Dave] Buckle up, Kassandra!

93
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:18,617
- What are you gonna do?

94
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,033
What are you doing?

95
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,368
- I didn't buy this SUV so
we could be pushed around.

96
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,245
- Oh, what are you-
- I'm taking the bull

97
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,455
by the horns-
- Dave! (grunts)

98
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,123
- And I'm protecting
our territory.

99
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:29,127
(engine revving)

100
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:31,963
Hang on, girls!

101
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:35,675
(frenetic orchestral music)

102
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:52,025
- Oh, yeah.

103
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:54,193
Let's say goodbye to him,
too, when he goes by.

104
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:54,985
- [Jerry] Now, you feel better?

105
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,028
Thank you!

106
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:00,283
- [Dave] Well, there you go.

107
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:01,658
You see what perseverance does?

108
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,172
- How exactly do you
expect me to get out?

109
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:17,008
And don't even try to tell me
to climb over to your side.

110
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,057
I can't believe you
parked this close.

111
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,558
What were you thinking?
- (sighs) Honey.

112
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,102
- Seriously, it's embarrassing,
what are you doing?

113
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,020
What are, Dave, what
are, what are you doing?

114
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,982
Let go of me, Dave! (screaming)

115
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:36,110
(bright lively music)

116
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:39,322
(Sandy gasping)

117
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:42,117
- All right, who's
ready for ice skating?

118
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,950
- I am!

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,787
- [Child] Come on
Amelia, kick the ball!

120
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,748
(children yelling)

121
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,458
- [Child] Hey, look at me!

122
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,418
- [Child] Kick the ball!

123
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,297
- I'm sorry, I got a
little carried away.

124
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,590
- A little?

125
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:58,925
Dave, you were like
a 12-year-old boy

126
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,010
playing bumper cars
at the amusement park.

127
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:03,178
- You're right.

128
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,388
You're absolutely right.

129
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,808
- Look, tomorrow my brother
and his family come,

130
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:11,812
my sister, her husband, your
father, your brother, the kids.

131
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,230
The house is gonna be packed.

132
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,275
I just wanna have a nice
quiet evening with my family.

133
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,527
- Absolutely.

134
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,532
I will be incident-free until
New Year's, scout's honor.

135
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:24,075
- [Sandy] Okay.

136
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:24,908
- Okay.

137
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:29,372
- Mom, can we divide rooms
up by family this year?

138
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:32,667
- [Sandy] Well, I put you and
all your cousins together.

139
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,542
- [Dave] It's okay.

140
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,793
- Hey, you're hot!

141
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:39,298
- But I don't wanna share a room

142
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:40,967
with Dad's side of the family.

143
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,260
- [Dave] Who's that
guy talking to?

144
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,343
- What's wrong with
Dad's side of family?

145
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,303
- [Kassandra] They
snore, all of 'em!

146
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:48,140
- All Madisons have
sinus problems, honey.

147
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,142
We can't help it.

148
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:51,935
- Well, I'm a Madison,
and I don't snore.

149
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,938
- That's because you're a
little angel just like Mommy.

150
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:55,982
- Yeah.
- Drop the zero.

151
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,608
Come hang with a hero.

152
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:59,277
(teens whistling)

153
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,277
- Who's he talking to?

154
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,238
Is he talking to you?

155
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:03,740
- Let it go, Dave.

156
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:06,200
- Hey, trying to spend
Christmas here with my family,

157
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,452
you little hooligan!

158
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:08,702
- [Sandy] Dave, what
did we just talk about?

159
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:10,245
- Perfectly calm.

160
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,457
- You know, maybe we should get

161
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,000
a couple of rooms
at the Holiday Inn.

162
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,000
We could afford it.

163
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:17,878
- What? No, no.

164
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:20,798
I want the whole family
together for the holidays.

165
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:22,967
Nobody is going to,
to the Holiday Inn.

166
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,677
- Yeah, but you know what
little space we have.

167
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,970
- Little space?

168
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,138
We live in a 3,000
square foot home

169
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,765
in one of the
nicest neighborhoods

170
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,600
in one of the richest
countries in the world.

171
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,895
- [Teen] You're good, babe.

172
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,938
- Dave, ignore it.

173
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:37,732
- Ignore what?

174
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:38,900
I didn't hear anything.

175
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,362
- Mom, my ankles hurt.

176
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:43,195
- Here.

177
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,073
Why don't you and your
mom go across the street

178
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:48,492
to Starbucks and
get a hot chocolate.

179
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,912
- What about you, Dad?

180
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:52,705
- No.

181
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:55,542
Gonna go pick up a
couple of quick laps,

182
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,710
just like Dad did in
the old college days.

183
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,837
- Just be careful,
that was 25 years ago.

184
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:02,257
- 24 years ago.

185
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,383
- Just be careful.

186
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:05,217
- Always.

187
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:10,055
(bright lively music)

188
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,683
Okay, hot shot.

189
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:15,018
Let's see how you like
the view from the ice.

190
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:21,817
(teen thuds)
Oh, pardon me.

191
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,818
You little jerk.

192
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,115
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪

193
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,950
♪ Jingle all the way ♪

194
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,245
(bright dramatic music)

195
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,247
Do you wanna play rough?

196
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,248
I can play rough.

197
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:42,422
(teen and Dave grunting)

198
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,382
- [Bystander] Somebody
call the police!

199
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,800
(crowd cheering)

200
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,635
- Dave!

201
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,437
(bright festive music)

202
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,118
(Dave sighing)

203
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,872
(tires spinning)

204
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,295
- Son of a-

205
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,922
- What's the matter?

206
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,175
- We're struck.

207
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,968
- Well, try rocking it.

208
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,432
(tires whirring)

209
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,232
- You're just making
the grooves deeper.

210
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,777
- All right, you
drive, I'll push.

211
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:56,328
Okay, one, two, three.

212
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:59,082
(tires whirring)

213
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,333
(Dave grunting)

214
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:05,503
(bright festive music continues)

215
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,065
Okay, I'm gonna use this board
to wedge it under the wheel,

216
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,608
give it something to grip on to.

217
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,320
When I say hit it, let it rip.

218
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:36,077
(Dave grunting)

219
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,370
- But, Dad, there isn't any
friction under the board.

220
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:39,997
When Mom hits the gas
pedal, it's gonna go flying.

221
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,250
- [Dave] Okay.

222
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,210
- [Kassandra] But.

223
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,002
- Hang on, Kassandra.

224
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:45,962
- [Kassandra] But Mom!

225
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,465
- All right, let her rip.

226
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:50,507
(tires whirring)

227
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,300
(board thuds)

228
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,345
(Dave yelling)

229
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,598
(gentle upbeat music)

230
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:19,328
Ah, be careful.
- Okay.

231
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:21,913
- Well, what happened, then?

232
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,582
- Just a little accident.

233
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,752
- Another accident?

234
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:33,342
Amazing, Darwin is yet to
finish the bloody fool off.

235
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:35,552
- Watch out.
- Oh.

236
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,637
- Ow!
- Sorry.

237
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,682
- I'll tell you, ever
since he was a little boy,

238
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:43,435
that Dave was always quick to
lose his temper. (laughing)

239
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,853
Well, here we are.

240
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:47,272
It's the morning of December
22nd, and the peace and quiet

241
00:10:47,357 --> 00:10:49,942
of the Madison family
home is about to end,

242
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,403
and the Bavarian horde
of relatives are about

243
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:55,447
to swoop in like a
level five tsunami.

244
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,657
This ought to be fun.

245
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:03,247
- [Sandy] Hmm, no,
no, I don't like it.

246
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,708
Let's try moving the
tree by the fireplace.

247
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,960
(Ben snoring)

248
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:12,130
(light upbeat music)

249
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,635
(Ben moaning)

250
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:23,683
- [Sandy] Hmm.

251
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:24,810
- [Dave] Huh, huh?

252
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:28,063
- Mm, yeah, no. No.

253
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:34,153
You know what, let's try it,
um, let's try it over there.

254
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,698
- Okay.
- Thanks.

255
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,412
- You are the slowest
driver I've ever seen.

256
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,497
- Maybe you should
say, thank you, Carol,

257
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,665
for getting to my
sister's safely.

258
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,458
- Look at this guy!

259
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,835
Look at this guy!

260
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,295
Are you seriously just
gonna let him cut you off?

261
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,927
(Dave grunting)

262
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:02,263
- (laughing) No, no.

263
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,182
You know what?

264
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,100
Let's try moving the recliner

265
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,810
and putting the
tree in the corner.

266
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:09,188
I think that'll look great.

267
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:10,730
- Me, too.
- Okay.

268
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,067
(Dave grunting)
Careful. Got it?

269
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,568
- Out of my way, you putz.

270
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:16,028
(horn honking)
Come on!

271
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:19,573
(Dave panting)

272
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:20,407
- Mm, no.

273
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:23,952
- I will stop this car!

274
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,287
I swear to everything holy,

275
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,247
I will stop this car
and come back there

276
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,542
and then you'll be in
a world of trouble!

277
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,628
(children grunting)

278
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:33,462
- Perfect.

279
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,340
Okay, just start the
fire and we're done.

280
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,468
(light gentle music)

281
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,598
(fire crackling)

282
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:58,862
- Dad! Dad!

283
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,865
Dad!

284
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,117
- Oh no! Dave!

285
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:05,285
David! David!

286
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:08,872
- Yeah, What?

287
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,790
- [Sandy] You forgot
to open the flue!

288
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:13,835
- What?

289
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,255
- [Sandy] You forgot
to open the flue!

290
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,257
(fire crackling)

291
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,633
(relatives chattering
indistinctly)

292
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:21,218
- Get in with me.
Go ahead, girls.

293
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:23,553
Okay, go ahead, girls. Okay.

294
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,555
Hello, hello!

295
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,432
(children cheering)

296
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:28,683
- [Sandy] How was your trip?

297
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,310
- Oh awful, seven
hours and 20 minutes.

298
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,103
That's the longest trip ever.

299
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,690
(relatives chattering)

300
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,775
- Are you okay?
- No, we're not hungry!

301
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:37,902
- What do you mean
we're not hungry?

302
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,528
You can't tell me
when I'm not hungry.

303
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:40,905
- I'm hungry!

304
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:41,822
- I don't care, I don't
want you in that kitchen.

305
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:42,990
They have enough to do in there.

306
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,742
- What kind of
toilet paper you got?

307
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,493
- Glad to see you.
- Hi!

308
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:47,410
- So good to see you.

309
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,787
- Now, this is my orange soda.

310
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,580
I brought one for every day.

311
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,665
Look, got at my name on it,

312
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,333
DM, Daryl McCormick.

313
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:55,752
Okay, my name's on it.

314
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,672
- I ain't taking off my
shoes, my feet get cold.

315
00:13:57,755 --> 00:14:00,423
- I brought my footed pajamas.

316
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,468
- I can't work with those
single-ply nonsense.

317
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,388
- What kind of grown man
wears footie pajamas?

318
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:08,515
- I like to be
comfortable, okay, Matt?

319
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:11,560
- [Woman] Okay.

320
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,393
Hi!

321
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:14,813
- We're not handing out
free presents this year.

322
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,857
- Oh no, I'm not-
- Remember?

323
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,818
- Taking my shoes off, not,
this isn't Communist China.

324
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:23,780
Okay, come on, men,
let's storm the kitchen!

325
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:27,033
- Hey, uh, do me a favor.

326
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,410
Keys are in the jacket.

327
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,787
Go get my luggage,
would you? Bad back.

328
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:32,957
- Okay.

329
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,293
- (sighing) Merry
Christmas, Mister Madison.

330
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,087
- Merry Christmas,
Missus Madison.

331
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:46,303
("We Wish You a
Merry Christmas")

332
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,947
- [Matt] So how are
you Mister Madison?

333
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:07,742
- Well, I'm still alive.

334
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:16,542
Oh, enough of this small talk.

335
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,752
Let's turn on the TV.

336
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:21,588
- Hey, Dad.

337
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:22,673
- [Daryl] Yeah.

338
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:24,883
- Isn't it true that
Santa Claus is real?

339
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,760
- Of course he's real.

340
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,887
- See, told you.

341
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,727
- I really don't think
that making a batch

342
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,395
or two of cookies
is gonna hurt us.

343
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,688
- Cookies can be very harmful.

344
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,317
- I'll tell you what.

345
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,735
We'll go to the gym on
December 26th and burn it off.

346
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,027
What do you say?

347
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,903
- It's not just
the calories, Mom.

348
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,197
There's also the
long term effects

349
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,865
of over-exposure to sugar,

350
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,285
which can change your
insulin sensitivity

351
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,787
and you could get diabetes.

352
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,582
- I don't think we're in
any real danger of that.

353
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:57,750
- Well, maybe not.

354
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,918
But it can also cause
tooth decay, anxiety,

355
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,797
and a depressed feeling after
you crash from a sugar high.

356
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,923
No, thank you.

357
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,133
- Kassandra, come
on, he's doing it!

358
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:08,718
- Gotta go, Mom.

359
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,303
Brandon's gonna prove
that Santa Claus is real.

360
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:12,347
- Have fun!

361
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,725
- Here's part one
of my experiments

362
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,770
to prove that Santa
Claus is real.

363
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:18,770
All right, I want you
guys to wait out here

364
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,438
and witness me going
into the house.

365
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,732
Everyone else is already inside.

366
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:25,902
(light playful music)

367
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,403
- [Child In Red Cap]
What's that for?

368
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,738
- In case I get I get
stuck in the chimney,

369
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:29,907
my brothers can pull me out.

370
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,908
- Ah, smart.

371
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:34,870
- Here we go.

372
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:44,838
- What's that for?

373
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,173
- Brandon tied it
around his waist

374
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:48,175
so if he gets stuck
we can pull him down.

375
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,593
- Ah, smart!

376
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:51,928
- Brandon's no dummy.

377
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,433
- Come on Brandon,
you can do it.

378
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,103
- I'm stuck!

379
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,020
Help, help!

380
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,775
Help, I'm stuck, help, help!

381
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,277
Help!
- Guys, pull!

382
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,112
(Brandon yelling)

383
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:19,707
- Cookies!

384
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,045
- Cookies are ready.

385
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,423
- Well, what about Brandon?

386
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:29,633
- [Child Without A Hat] If
we don't get there fast,

387
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:30,883
Dad and Uncle
Ben'll eat them all.

388
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:42,062
- [Daryl] Mm, cookies.
We'll see about that.

389
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:45,148
- Um, where's Brandon?

390
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,318
- [Ben] Ooh!

391
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,155
- Uh, kids, have you
seen your cousin Brandon?

392
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,325
(light gentle music)

393
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,555
(Brandon yelling)

394
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,307
(Matt yelling)

395
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,518
(ornaments tinkling)

396
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:22,352
- Brandon!

397
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,772
(sirens wailing)

398
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:29,025
(gentle upbeat music)

399
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,037
- Well, I hope you
guys are happy.

400
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,998
You could've killed Brandon!

401
00:18:43,082 --> 00:18:44,165
Go inside, all of you.

402
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,710
And no cookies!

403
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,883
- I see your children
are misbehaving again.

404
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,802
- He's just a boy, Wesley.

405
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,557
- A halfwit boy who's gonna
grow up to be a halfwit man.

406
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,100
A lump of coal and
a good spanking,

407
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,937
that's what you'd get
for Christmas were
I were your father.

408
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,438
I'd be doing you
a favor, too, boy.

409
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,072
- Basement, shower, go.

410
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,325
And don't touch anything
on your way down.

411
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:22,328
Dave!

412
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:25,540
Dave!

413
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:30,962
Have you seen Dave?

414
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,213
- [Man] Where? All right.

415
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,757
- Think he's around
here somewhere.

416
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,138
- Oh, oh, Mister
Madison, your shoes.

417
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,723
- Just a little coffee please.

418
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,272
- Dave!

419
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:51,650
Dave?

420
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,193
- Huh, huh?

421
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,570
What's going on?

422
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:55,695
- What are you doing?

423
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:58,532
- I cut a hole on the floor

424
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,492
so I could go ice fishing.

425
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:01,702
What does it look
like I'm doing?

426
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:02,577
I'm taking a nap.

427
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,412
- Why?

428
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,122
- Because I'm tired, Sandy.

429
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,082
- What do you have
to be tired about?

430
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,750
I spent all morning cooking.

431
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,043
I've been following your father

432
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,670
and his melting shoes
around the house with a mop.

433
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,130
And I just helped
the fire department

434
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,923
fish Brandon out of the chimney.

435
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,342
- Chimney?

436
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,093
- Now I need you to
shovel the driveway.

437
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:19,010
- Why?
- Because

438
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,095
there's snow on it, David.

439
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:21,053
- And?

440
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,057
- And everybody's parked
out on the street,

441
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,725
and we have a
perfectly big driveway.

442
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:26,017
And if you just shovel it,

443
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,810
then everybody can put
in to the driveway.

444
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,187
- What do you care
if people are parked

445
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,357
in the street or the driveway?

446
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,773
- Get out of that bed!

447
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,360
- Fine!

448
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,152
Fine!

449
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,455
(gentle light music)

450
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,248
- Hey!

451
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,167
Hey!

452
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,175
Hey, how much for the driveway?

453
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,927
- 50 bucks.

454
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,138
- Ah, come on that's a little...

455
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,682
All right.

456
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,350
- You want the walk done, too?

457
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:10,353
- Well, yeah, the walk,
the porch, the driveway,

458
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,188
the whole thing.

459
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,107
- 60.

460
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,107
- Ah, come on.

461
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,402
- Come on, boys, lets go.

462
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:17,277
- All right, fine.

463
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,445
60 bucks.

464
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,323
- All right, get to
work, come on, go. Here.

465
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,287
- Oh, you know what?

466
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,622
My neighbor's pushing 80.

467
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:30,915
So do his for me, too.

468
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,625
- Okay.

469
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,918
- I mean, hey.

470
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:34,585
It's the big guy's
birthday, right?

471
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,213
- What is it?

472
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:39,007
- Christmas.

473
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,885
- Oh, Merry Christmas.

474
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,847
- This one and the
one next door, okay.

475
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,638
- Okay.

476
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:51,478
- Oh, and, uh, hey, don't ring
the bell when you're done.

477
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:53,438
I'll be watching
and I'll come out.

478
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:55,190
- [Earl] Okay.

479
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:58,152
Hey, come on slackers,
get your back into it.

480
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:02,238
Go ahead and throw a whole
shovelful on your brother.

481
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,535
(bright lively music)

482
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,498
- [Carol] You need to
add 3/4 cup of sugar

483
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:13,500
and a pinch of ginger.

484
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,752
- [Rachel] No, you only need
1/2 a cup of brown sugar

485
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:19,547
and a dash, not a pinch,
a dash of cinnamon.

486
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,173
- Attention!

487
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,592
Attention!

488
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,510
In five minutes, we
will finally be done

489
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,345
baking cookies for the year.

490
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:29,473
- Psst.

491
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,183
Psst!

492
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,103
- Dave, what are
you doing, buddy?

493
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:34,897
- Hey!

494
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,523
- Shut up, shut up!

495
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,067
I need your room.

496
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,068
- My room? What for?

497
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,153
- Stop asking questions.

498
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:45,948
Just keep Carol busy for about
an hour so I can take a nap.

499
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,325
- I don't no.

500
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,452
Sounds like we'll
get in trouble.

501
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,497
- Yeah, What's in it for us?

502
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:55,083
- How about a free
home, free food,

503
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,127
and use of my big screen TV?

504
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,255
- Nah, I already got that.

505
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,840
- Yeah.

506
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,720
- Fine, Christmas dinner,
you can have the turkey legs.

507
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,430
It's my house, but you
can have the drumsticks.

508
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,812
- Deal.

509
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,188
- Oh, we'll cover you.

510
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:18,273
- All right.

511
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,275
- We'll go right now.

512
00:23:23,112 --> 00:23:23,862
- These hot?

513
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,405
- Hey, no touching.

514
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:27,657
- What are you doing?

515
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,617
- I'm starving.

516
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,408
- Daryl, get out.

517
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:30,785
- Matt, not now.

518
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,245
No, no!

519
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,705
- Matt, take it off.

520
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,332
- I'm hungry.

521
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,292
Hey wait, that's for
Christmas dinner.

522
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,793
- I said go!

523
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,378
- I just never seen
you in the kitchen.

524
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:41,295
- Get out of here.

525
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,548
- Go away.

526
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:44,382
- Just go!

527
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,280
- It can't be done,

528
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,032
you'd have to have a
super human stomach.

529
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,325
- Of course it can.

530
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:11,702
What about that
little Chinese guy

531
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:12,952
that eats all the hot dogs?

532
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:13,870
- That's true.

533
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,330
My dad and me saw it on TV.

534
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:18,750
He ate 68 hot dogs
in only ten minutes.

535
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,335
- Yeah see, that's
just in ten minutes.

536
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,422
Santa has all night
to eat cookies.

537
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:25,882
- That's it, that's
the last batch.

538
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,385
We are finally and officially
done baking cookies.

539
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,178
- Yeah.

540
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:32,430
- Well, even if he ate
one cookie at every house,

541
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,308
it would still be like
thousands of cookies.

542
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:37,602
- Okay, I'll prove it to you.

543
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,145
Bring me all the
cookies in the house,

544
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,313
and a big glass of milk.

545
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,340
- Ooh, it must be good.

546
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,468
Driveway's all shoveled.

547
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:53,387
- Thank you, dear.

548
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:03,313
Okay everybody, cars
in the driveway please.

549
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:05,398
Matt, Daryl, come on move it.

550
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,108
Hey Ben, hear me over there.

551
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,027
Let's go, cars in
the driveway please.

552
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:12,988
Mister Madison, would you like
me to move your car for you?

553
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,782
- I'll drive my own darn car.

554
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:21,873
- Hey guys.

555
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:25,293
Okay, that's a $120 I owe you.

556
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,045
- Let's see, it's
$60 for this house.

557
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,173
$60 for your house, that's uh,

558
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,970
you have a pen and
a piece of paper?

559
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,345
- No, I don't.

560
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,430
But it's a 120.

561
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:42,102
- Or you could just
give me $60 twice.

562
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:44,103
- I could, that's true.

563
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,522
But I'd rather not
write two checks.

564
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,232
- Oh no no no checks.

565
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:47,982
- Excuse me?

566
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:48,817
- Cash only.

567
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:52,778
I don't have $120 in cash on me.

568
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:55,115
- You got $60, twice?

569
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,368
- Look, we're not gypsies.

570
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,663
Our house isn't going anywhere.

571
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:03,415
I'm not gonna write
you a bad check.

572
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:04,748
- Cash only.

573
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,168
You gonna have to go
to one of those ATMs.

574
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,550
- Look, my car is in the garage.

575
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:15,052
I'm backed in.

576
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:16,302
- Okay.

577
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,053
- Thank you.

578
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:17,845
- We'll take my car.

579
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,430
Come on boys, let's go.

580
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,265
Move it.

581
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:26,062
All right kids, load it up
we're going to the bank.

582
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:31,693
(doors squeaking)

583
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,078
(van starting)

584
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,875
You go to college?

585
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,460
- University of Michigan.

586
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:50,920
- Waste of time.

587
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,547
They don't teach you
anything but socialism there.

588
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,590
I'm Earl.

589
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:54,673
- Dave.

590
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:57,468
- Hey Dave, you look
like a real smart fellow.

591
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:59,428
- Well, I appreciate that.

592
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:00,680
- I might just
have an opportunity

593
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,890
for you to make some real money.

594
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:07,020
My half brother,
he's also my cousin,

595
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,980
he's into that
multilevel marketing.

596
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:12,025
I'd like to get the two
of you guys together.

597
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:13,485
In a room, together.

598
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,738
(polka music)

599
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:30,585
- How does this thing work?

600
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:31,878
I always go inside.

601
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,547
- You put in your PIN.

602
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,717
- PIN? I don't know my PIN.

603
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,635
- You just type it in.

604
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,052
- I don't know what it is.

605
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:44,848
- Why don't you call your wife?

606
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:48,603
- There's no way I could
possibly explain this.

607
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:53,483
Look, will you
just take a check?

608
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:55,735
- No, no, I can't take a check.

609
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:58,988
I'll tell you what,
me and the boys here,

610
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,573
we need some groceries.

611
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:03,743
Why don't we hop back in
the van, we'll go shopping.

612
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:05,870
You can pay for it.

613
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:10,292
- Fine.

614
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,625
- Okay, come on boys.

615
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,058
- Where are you going?

616
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:28,058
- Grocery store.

617
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,768
- Grocery store's over there.

618
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,562
- Yeah I like the
9th Bridge Market.

619
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,690
- Where is that?

620
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:34,690
- Across town.

621
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,608
Won't take more
than 20-25 minutes.

622
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:38,277
- Oh, good.

623
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:42,490
- Brandon!

624
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:45,702
What happened to him?

625
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,705
Well, somebody knows, speak.

626
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:20,778
- Look at these hot
dogs, they all beef?

627
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,155
- I don't know, I
don't work here.

628
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,157
- How much longer are
we going to be here?

629
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:27,243
- We're gonna be here
till we're done shopping.

630
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:30,872
Now why don't you go run around
get something to eat? Go.

631
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,625
I wonder if these are all beef.

632
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,253
You know, this place used
to be beer and bait shop?

633
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:40,632
Now it's all fancy
shnancy pantsy.

634
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:42,633
Maybe we oughta go back to the
store you were talking about.

635
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:44,677
- We're not going to
another market, Earl.

636
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,137
You wanted to come here.

637
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,472
We're here.

638
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:48,723
- All right, all
right, all right.

639
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:49,557
You mind pushing?

640
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:57,648
What in the world
is a Swedish fish?

641
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:00,360
You have big plans
for Christmas day?

642
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:02,903
Earl, your kids are eating
candy and drinking soda.

643
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,448
- Yeah, I know, I'd suppose
I oughta feel guilty.

644
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:06,782
- Or may be stop them?

645
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,242
- [Earl] But it's Christmas!

646
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,745
They wanna get all hopped
up on sugar one time a year,

647
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,538
it's okay by me, you want
them to bring you a chocolate?

648
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:13,707
- No, thank you.

649
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,498
- Soda?

650
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:15,333
- Am all set, Earl!

651
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,335
I think we're at the 120.

652
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,253
None for me either,

653
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:20,797
I'm on the Atkins diet now.

654
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,798
All protein, baby.

655
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:27,762
- 137 dollars and 28 cents.

656
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:29,347
- You got $17.

657
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,558
- Let's just call it gas money.

658
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,185
- Gas money?

659
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:35,102
- What, I drove.

660
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,772
Hey, do you know if those
hot dogs are all beef?

661
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,065
- Don't answer that question,

662
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,858
just put it in the
bag, we'll take 'em.

663
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:42,902
Thank you.

664
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:44,737
There you go.

665
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,825
Here you go 137 and 28 cents.

666
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:55,038
(siren blaring)

667
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,335
- [Sandy] Where have you been?

668
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,295
- I was just-

669
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:01,878
- Brandon ate all the cookies.

670
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,505
Six batches, every
single one of them.

671
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,798
- Six batches?

672
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,217
- Yeah, they just took
him to the hospital.

673
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,135
Carol went with him.

674
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:09,387
You know I was yelling for you,

675
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,805
Dave? Dave?

676
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:11,722
But of course,

677
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:12,890
you were nowhere to be found.

678
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,017
- Well, I was just-

679
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,183
- Well, you were what?

680
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,938
- I was just shoveling
Mister Nicolas' driveway.

681
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,815
You know, he's almost 80.

682
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:22,900
It's the holidays.

683
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:23,818
- Oh, honey.

684
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:25,027
- So I figured why not help him?

685
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,738
- Sweetie, that
is so nice of you.

686
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:30,240
Oh honey, I'm sorry, sorry.

687
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,912
I'm gonna have to make
some more cookies, now.

688
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:35,830
Oh, you know what?

689
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:37,207
Here's the list of ingredients.

690
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,833
I'm gonna need you to go to
the 9th Bridge Market for me.

691
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:40,918
Thanks.

692
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,847
- Ah, Merry Christmas.

693
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,307
- Merry Christmas.

694
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,933
- Oh, you got me.

695
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,602
Boy, your quiet.

696
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,812
Don't let Missus Claus
find out about this.

697
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,897
Now, where were we?

698
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,648
Oh, yes, yes.

699
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,485
Between them, the
Rockford Fire Department

700
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:07,987
having to rescue Brandon
from the chimney,

701
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,490
and Dave being dragged
all over town by Earl?

702
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:14,743
Well, the Madison
family's had quite a day.

703
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:15,745
Let's see what kind of mischief

704
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,872
they get into on
the 23rd, shall we?

705
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:21,208
- I will now prove to
you that it is possible,

706
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:25,045
given enough speed and reindeer
power, to make a sled fly.

707
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:30,008
(dramatic orchestral music)

708
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,978
- Dave, are you
watching the kids?

709
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,230
- Dave's fixing the toilet.

710
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:49,945
(dramatic orchestral music)

711
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,915
- Hike, come on hike,

712
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,083
go, go, go.

713
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:06,670
(tense orchestral music)

714
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,013
(yelling)

715
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:21,018
(children chattering)

716
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,608
(siren blaring)

717
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,823
- Oh my gosh, Brandon.

718
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:37,618
Thank you.

719
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,293
- Hey, what are you doing?

720
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,380
- Dave.

721
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,048
- Why are you in my kitchen?

722
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:51,840
- Your kitchen?

723
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,008
This is my house.

724
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:53,927
- What do you want, Dave?

725
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,052
No, that food is for dinner.

726
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,637
- Dave, we're busy.

727
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,138
- Which of this
food is for lunch?

728
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,765
(talking over each other)

729
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,017
What is this, Yom Kippur,

730
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,893
am I supposed to
fast until sundown?

731
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:04,812
- Get out of the kitchen.

732
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:05,647
You are making a mess.

733
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,938
- Go!

734
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:10,192
- It's supposed to be
for everyone, Dave.

735
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,405
- Dad, I'm going out for
some lunch, You wanna come?

736
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:16,365
- No, the girls fixed
me a little soup.

737
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:18,910
- What?

738
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,037
You made dad soup?

739
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,080
- [Woman] Stay out
of the kitchen, Dave.

740
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:24,998
- Fine!

741
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:34,092
(lighthearted music)

742
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:48,022
- Hey, Uncle Dave, get him!

743
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,442
- [Child] Give me some.

744
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:53,110
- You better run.

745
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,367
- Grandpa Madison?

746
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,660
- Oh, hi Kassandra.

747
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,497
Grandpa Madison, do
you believe in Santa?

748
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,042
- Of course I do.

749
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,793
- What about for bad children?

750
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:14,048
- Let me tell you a
little secret, Kassandra.

751
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:15,257
There are no bad children.

752
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,013
- What if I mailed this
letter to Santa today?

753
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:22,598
Do you think he'd
get it on time?

754
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,017
- No, I don't think he would.

755
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,938
- Oh, okay, thanks Grandpa.

756
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:33,275
- However, if you
gave me the letter,

757
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,653
I might be able to give
it to him personally.

758
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,992
You see, when you live
as long as I have,

759
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,285
you know am awful lot
of important people.

760
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,078
- Really?

761
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:46,163
- Yeah.

762
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:48,498
- Thanks, Grandpa.

763
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:53,545
- All right.

764
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:05,140
All right, you two,
up, out of here,

765
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,518
get your cars, you
got me parked in.

766
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:09,187
- Where you going
Mister Madison?

767
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,147
- To a place where people
mind their own darn business.

768
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:15,233
- I think we're okay here, dad.

769
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:17,278
I mean we got the TV
on, we got snacks,

770
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:19,030
and we're wearing slippers.

771
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:22,073
- All right, long hair
fat boy, out of here.

772
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:25,202
- Mister Madison, hey my car
is at the end of the driveway.

773
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,537
Why don't you borrow mine?

774
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,622
- I'm not driving any
little foreign pansy car.

775
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,042
I drive a Cadillac
like a real man.

776
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:34,712
All right, this conversation
is over, out of here.

777
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:35,545
- Yeah.

778
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:38,215
- Nope.

779
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,353
"Dear Santa,

780
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:57,360
all I want for Christmas and
my birthday this year is a dog.

781
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,153
Well, I would also
like peace on earth

782
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:02,365
and good health
to all my family,

783
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:06,118
including Grandpa
Madison, who is old,

784
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:09,455
and my Grandma,
who I loved, died.

785
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:11,957
But I also really want a dog.

786
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,252
I don't even care what kind.

787
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:15,670
I would be nice to it,

788
00:38:15,753 --> 00:38:18,130
and take it on lots of walks.

789
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,507
I promise.

790
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,133
I don't even need any
other toys or anything.

791
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,178
Love, Kassandra.

792
00:38:24,262 --> 00:38:28,307
PS, I have been very,
very good this year."

793
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,187
Okay, okay Kassandra.

794
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:38,358
(Asian music)

795
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:42,738
(crowd talking)

796
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,597
- Geez, it's like the
OK Corral in here.

797
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,017
- Yup, been in line 45 minutes.

798
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,100
What you're gonna do?

799
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,893
It's Christmas, it's
the only place open.

800
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,315
(sneezing)

801
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:22,110
(light music)

802
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:34,498
- How many your party?

803
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:35,332
- One.

804
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:36,625
- No, one, sorry.

805
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,252
You come back new year.

806
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:39,545
- Excuse me?

807
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:40,462
- It's too busy,

808
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,172
three or four people table.

809
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,882
- Well, there's a little
piece of information

810
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,550
I could have used
about an hour ago.

811
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,343
- Next please.

812
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:47,135
- No, next please.

813
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,553
I want a table.

814
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:53,183
- We'll sit with you.

815
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:55,770
- Yeah, me and Fred here.

816
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,813
Fred's my man.

817
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,358
We'll all sit
together, it'll be fun.

818
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:02,192
- Come on.

819
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,403
- Okay.

820
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,200
- Oh, little nip?

821
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,453
- No, I don't.

822
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:13,287
Thank you though.

823
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,500
- Fred and I just
met on Tuesday.

824
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:19,710
- [Dave] Okay.

825
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,257
- Yeah, we're living together.

826
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:29,387
- All right.

827
00:40:31,305 --> 00:40:32,807
- So what do you
think about that?

828
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,308
- Well, it's truly none of my,

829
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:42,900
look, you two are adults,
you do what you like.

830
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:45,735
- Come on.

831
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,362
Stop being so shy.

832
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,572
He's so shy.

833
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:50,407
- Well, okay.

834
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:55,037
You say that you're
living together.

835
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,330
What do you mean?

836
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:57,790
You're living together
in the same house?

837
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:00,292
Or do you mean, you're living
together in the same room?

838
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,585
Bed, et cetera.

839
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:03,545
- Hey now, you know what?

840
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,172
Shame on you.

841
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:06,257
- Excuse me?

842
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,340
- Yeah, it's not something

843
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,133
you ask a lady at
the dinner table.

844
00:41:09,218 --> 00:41:11,387
- Well, may we should not
talk about any of this.

845
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,680
- You know what,
maybe we should.

846
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:14,348
Why don't you guys
discuss it all evening.

847
00:41:14,432 --> 00:41:15,892
So I can finish
my plate of food.

848
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:17,183
You know what, my
night's ruined.

849
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:18,018
Thanks.

850
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:26,985
- You know,

851
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,113
just between you and me,

852
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:33,575
I'm really glad you're
here to see that.

853
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,663
'Cause I think he's way more
into me than I'm into him.

854
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,835
He's just threatened by you.

855
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:55,472
- Guys.

856
00:41:57,558 --> 00:42:01,562
I feel like, I owe
you guys an apology.

857
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:05,148
I've had a lot on my mind.

858
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:06,025
- No, Fred, don't.

859
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,275
- No, it's okay, honey.

860
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,573
We're family, and I
want you to know this.

861
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,160
Look man, my buddy
in the war, he,

862
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,207
he got bird flu.

863
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,293
It's messing me up man.

864
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:27,713
It's messing me up.

865
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:41,393
- Oh, separate checks please.

866
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:42,770
- No separate check.

867
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:51,028
- Hey, I'm gonna pay for her.

868
00:42:51,112 --> 00:42:51,820
- Fine, whatever.

869
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:56,783
- You know what hon, it's on us.

870
00:42:56,867 --> 00:42:57,785
It was our pleasure.

871
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,412
- You're so sweet.

872
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,538
Isn't he just the sweetest?

873
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,338
- Okay then, my lunch was 5.99.

874
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:18,805
Here's 20, just give me 10
back and I'll be on my way.

875
00:43:21,017 --> 00:43:22,517
Don't worry about
it man, like I said,

876
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,435
I got her covered.

877
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:26,480
- Yeah, however, the
two of you divided

878
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:27,690
is between the two of you.

879
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:29,400
Just give me 10 back.

880
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:32,527
- Ah, let's see.

881
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,452
You know what, here.

882
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,453
There you go.

883
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,080
- What is this?

884
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,415
This is like two,

885
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,293
three dollars.

886
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,172
- Don't worry about it.

887
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:52,422
I don't need any change.

888
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:53,840
- It's not enough Fred.

889
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,052
- Hey, what are you doing?

890
00:43:56,135 --> 00:43:57,678
No, I ate, put your purse away.

891
00:43:57,762 --> 00:43:59,638
Woman you're embarrassing me.

892
00:43:59,722 --> 00:44:01,223
I told you, we got this.

893
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:15,445
(bell ringing)

894
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:18,532
- Hi, Santa.

895
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:19,450
- Merry Christmas.

896
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:21,535
Oh, thank you.

897
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:26,582
Ho ho ho, Mister Madison,
Merry Christmas sir.

898
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:27,665
- I know you?

899
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:28,958
- I know you.

900
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:30,585
I've known you since
you were a little boy.

901
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,253
- You don't know jack.

902
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:34,548
- I see you while
you're sleeping.

903
00:44:34,632 --> 00:44:36,508
- What are you after, a fat lip?

904
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:39,387
- Aisle seven.

905
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:40,678
- What's that?

906
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:42,932
- What you're looking
for, from the letter.

907
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,600
Don't get one of
those small ones.

908
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,478
The ankle biters, she
doesn't want that.

909
00:44:48,562 --> 00:44:50,647
- How do you know what?

910
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,817
- Aisle seven, huh?

911
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,485
- [Santa] Aisle seven.

912
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:56,695
- Yeah, okay, merry.

913
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:58,488
- Merry Christmas to you, sir.

914
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:00,198
- Yeah, sure.

915
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:06,580
(knocking on door)

916
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:08,040
- Kassandra, get dressed please.

917
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:09,040
- I am dressed.

918
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,458
I'm not naked mom.

919
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:12,418
- Stop reading, and put
on the dress and tights

920
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:13,920
I laid out for you.

921
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,130
- What for?

922
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,340
- Your father's
office holiday party.

923
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:18,258
- No, no, no mom, no!

924
00:45:18,342 --> 00:45:20,260
- Kassandra, don't start.

925
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,470
- But I was gonna go
to the dog park today.

926
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,557
- Well, you can go to the
dog park another time.

927
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,640
I need you

928
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,683
to get ready.
- I hate dad's office parties.

929
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:28,060
- It's not that bad.

930
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:29,478
- Yeah, but that weird old guy

931
00:45:29,562 --> 00:45:31,730
always talks to me
about stock profiles.

932
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:34,107
- Mister Drummers talks to
everybody about his stock.

933

be such an easy target

934
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,693
if you would just get
up out of that chair.

935
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:39,530
Why don't you ever play
with the other kids?

936
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:41,657
- Because Kyle is just gonna
spill food on me again.

937
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:42,950
I just know it.

938
00:45:43,033 --> 00:45:44,325

I'm sorry, do I know you?

1016
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:43,690

00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:45,733
and your neighbor's
driveway yesterday.

1040
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:24,958

a morning type of girl.

1041
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:28,295
But that's okay.

1042

Kassandra and I have some
last minute shopping to do.

1045
00:51:37,053 --> 00:51:39,597
We need you to drive, so you

00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,100
while you circle around
forever for parking spot.

1047
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:43,685
We're gonna need your
help carrying things too.

1048

1057
00:52:15,175 --> 00:52:17,927
My wife, she
volunteered me for this.

1058
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,012
- Oh yeah?

1059
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:20,513
- Missus Claus.

1060
00:52:20,597 --> 00:52:21,765
Big into charities.

1061
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:24,517
- I tell you, I
know how that goes.

1062
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,852
How's business?

1063
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:27,562
- Mostly pretty good.

1064
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:28,980
And it's fun.

1065
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,648
You get the bell,
you get the hat.

1066
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:32,025
The whole nine yards.

1067
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:33,735
- And the kids like you.

1068
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:34,862
That's a plus.

1069
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:37,030
- Your kid doesn't like you?

1070
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:39,698
- She loves me.

1071
00:52:41,535 --> 00:52:43,787
But right now she
doesn't like me.

1072
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,788
She wants a dog.

1073
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:46,623
- Aah.

1074
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:50,043
You and her mother don't?

1075
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:53,087
- So I have to be
the one to say no.

1076
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:55,632
You know how that goes?

1077
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:57,092
- Yes, I do.

1078
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:01,428
- I used to be so fun loving.

1079
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:02,847
I don't feel old.

1080
00:53:04,057 --> 00:53:06,100
When did I become the
guy that has to say no?

1081
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:10,355
- Well. (laughing)

1082
00:53:10,438 --> 00:53:11,898
When you were a boy,

1083
00:53:11,982 --> 00:53:13,692
you wanted toys.

1084
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:15,485
But that came with a
little responsibility.

1085
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:18,112
You know, pick up after
yourself, that sort of thing.

1086
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:20,573
As you got older,

1087
00:53:20,657 --> 00:53:22,283
you wanted a child.

1088
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:25,620
Bigger reward, but a
lot more responsibility.

1089
00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:30,208
- Sounds like you
speak from experience.

1090
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:31,000
You have kids?

1091
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,670
- Yeah, you could
say that. (laughing)

1092
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:35,755
This time of the year pal,

1093
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,840
boy my responsibilities,
I tell you.

1094
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,093
- Yeah, the holidays
can be rough.

1095
00:53:40,177 --> 00:53:41,343
- [Santa] Yes, they can.

1096
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,013
- I'm Dave.

1097
00:53:45,098 --> 00:53:46,140
- Kris.

1098
00:53:48,352 --> 00:53:49,602
- That's your real name?

1099
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,022
- As long as I can remember.

1100
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,567
- Don't tell me your
last name is Kringle.

1101
00:53:56,652 --> 00:53:57,860
- Okay, I won't.

1102
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:01,405
- It's cold.

1103
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:04,158
- Well, I'm a fat guy.

1104
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:07,037
- That's gotta help.

1105
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,040
Hey, you want me to get
you a coffee or something?

1106
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:11,040
I'm not going anywhere.

1107
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:12,542
- Oh, no no, thank you though.

1108
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:15,670
- Well, if you need
anything just let me know.

1109
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,463
- Thank you, I appreciate that.

1110
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:21,927
Actually, I could
use a bathroom.

1111
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,890
(bell ringing)

1112
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,017
- Ho Ho Ho!

1113
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,352
Merry Christmas!

1114
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:31,645
- Is that your father?

1115
00:54:31,728 --> 00:54:33,772
- [Dave] Ho ho ho,
Merry Christmas!

1116
00:54:33,855 --> 00:54:34,897
- Dave?

1117
00:54:34,982 --> 00:54:35,857
- Ho ho ho!

1118
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,860
- What are you doing?

1119
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,030
- Santa had to go
to the bathroom.

1120
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:44,073
- Dad, you're weird.

1121
00:54:44,157 --> 00:54:46,952
- Ho ho ho, Merry
Christmas everyone.

1122
00:54:47,035 --> 00:54:49,870
Ho ho, Merry Christmas everyone.

1123
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:50,705
Ho ho ho.

1124
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:52,290
Ho ho ho.

1125
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,668
Merry Christmas.

1126
00:54:56,878 --> 00:54:57,670
- Dave!

1127
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:00,465
Dave!

1128
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:05,137
Dave!

1129
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:08,222
It's me, Susanna.

1130
00:55:09,057 --> 00:55:11,267
From the Japan restaurant.

1131
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,352
- Oh, hi.

1132
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:14,187
- And you'll never
guess who's here.

1133
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,022
Fred!

1134
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:20,110
Fred, get your behind out
of the car man, it's Dave.

1135
00:55:21,277 --> 00:55:25,115
He's been talking and talking
and talking about you.

1136
00:55:25,198 --> 00:55:27,158
I'm so glad he
made a real friend.

1137
00:55:27,242 --> 00:55:30,287
Those other guys used to
hang out with were losers.

1138
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,372
- Yo, bro, been trying
to call you man.

1139
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:36,417
- I don't remember
giving you my number.

1140
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,168
- You didn't, and honestly

1141
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:39,503
that's made it a
little difficult.

1142
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:41,130
You know how many Daves are
there in the phone book?

1143
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:44,300
I dialed like a hundred of
them but then I passed out.

1144
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,637
- He did, he was just trying
to call you like a 100 times.

1145
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,805
- Can I please?

1146
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:50,682
I literally just said that.

1147
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:52,183
- Okay all right.

1148
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:53,852
I'm gonna let you boys catch up,

1149
00:55:53,935 --> 00:55:54,977
I'm heading inside.

1150
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,148
- She's great isn't she?

1151
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:02,277
I mean, she's always
going on and on,

1152
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,237
but how are you man?

1153
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:08,198
Hey, I've got some friends,
we got a bowling league.

1154
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:09,450
There's a waiting list,

1155
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,203
but I talked to
them and got you in.

1156
00:56:13,455 --> 00:56:14,663
I mean you weren't
on it right away,

1157
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,707
I had to talk to them,
but you're on it.

1158
00:56:16,792 --> 00:56:19,085
- Great, great, thanks.

1159
00:56:20,128 --> 00:56:21,128
- It is great.

1160
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:22,505
Hey, what are you
doing tomorrow?

1161
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,968
- Tomorrow is a
Christmas day, Fred.

1162
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:27,927
I may be busy.

1163
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,220
- You wanna go hunting?

1164
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,555
I got a bunch of guns
in the truck right now.

1165
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:31,347
You wanna see 'em?

1166
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:32,348
- No, not now.

1167
00:56:33,642 --> 00:56:35,268
- I'm serious.

1168
00:56:35,352 --> 00:56:36,978
There's like a petting zoo,
just south of Grand Rapids.

1169
00:56:37,062 --> 00:56:37,895
Nobody's there right now.

1170
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,563
We could bag 'em and tag 'em.

1171
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:41,817
- Well, that sounds great Fred.

1172
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:45,403
But tomorrow is Christmas
day and I think I have plans.

1173
00:56:47,197 --> 00:56:48,238
I'll check with the wife.

1174
00:56:51,952 --> 00:56:56,497
Thank you, Merry
Christmas. (bell ringing)

1175
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,917
- People just come up
and give you money?

1176
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,750
- Yeah.

1177
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:02,837
- Industry.

1178
00:57:04,172 --> 00:57:06,090
Hey, I don't mean
to be too forward,

1179
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:10,010
but I'm a little light on
cash for the holidays and all.

1180
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,430
Think you could help out?

1181
00:57:16,392 --> 00:57:19,770
(light orchestral music)

1182
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,452
- Warm in here, isn't it?

1183
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:37,913
(classical piano music)

1184
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,668
I want fresh air.

1185
00:57:43,712 --> 00:57:47,257
(classical violin music)

1186
00:57:51,845 --> 00:57:54,180
(exhaling)

1187
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:04,023
What the (indistinct) is this?

1188
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:05,317
Hey!

1189
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,193
You bunch of little delinquents!

1190
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:13,658
(bright orchestral music)

1191
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:20,415
- Go have fun.

1192
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:33,970
Hey you kids, do
whatever you wanna do.

1193
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:40,685
Merry Christmas.

1194
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:42,228
- Yeah, you too.

1195
00:58:42,312 --> 00:58:43,437
Merry Christmas.

1196
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,522
- It's so cold.

1197
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:27,648
- Cold it is.

1198
00:59:30,277 --> 00:59:31,485
- So, which one's yours?

1199
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:36,073
- You see the little
white one over there.

1200
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:38,450
It's my girlfriend's and mine.

1201
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,370
Yeah, she wanted a small dog.

1202
00:59:40,453 --> 00:59:41,412
I wanted a big dog.

1203
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:45,040
So we compromised
and got a small dog.

1204
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,083
- Compromise, huh?

1205
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:47,377
- Yeah.

1206
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,712
- Yeah, when you get married,

1207
00:59:48,795 --> 00:59:51,338
there's gonna be a lot
more compromises to come.

1208
00:59:52,632 --> 00:59:54,758
- So anyway, which dog is yours?

1209
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,303
- I don't have a dog.

1210
00:59:57,387 --> 00:59:58,345
But it's all I want though.

1211
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,348
I don't care about
any other gifts.

1212
01:00:00,432 --> 01:00:03,433
I either want it for my
birthday or Christmas.

1213
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:05,395
- You know, a dog
can be a lot of work.

1214
01:00:05,478 --> 01:00:07,522
- You're a lot of work.

1215
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:08,732
- That's what my mom says.

1216
01:00:08,815 --> 01:00:10,358
But I'll do it all by myself.

1217
01:00:10,442 --> 01:00:13,235
I'd walk it, I'd feed
it, I'd let it out,

1218
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,528
I'd take it to the dog park.

1219
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:17,157
And I'll hold it's paw
like that at the vet.

1220
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,283
- I hope you get
your wish this year.

1221
01:00:20,368 --> 01:00:21,118
- Me too.

1222
01:00:22,495 --> 01:00:23,872
- All right guys, I am freezing.

1223
01:00:23,955 --> 01:00:24,705
I'm out of here.

1224
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,917
Lovie, come here.

1225
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:30,127
Lovie.

1226
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,255
My girl friend named
her, obviously.

1227
01:00:33,172 --> 01:00:34,298
- Obviously.

1228
01:00:34,382 --> 01:00:36,258
- Come here, come here girl.

1229
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:41,597
Can I ask you a favor?

1230
01:00:44,267 --> 01:00:46,477
If you get near her.

1231
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,770
She knows her name.

1232
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:48,813
If you just call it.

1233
01:00:48,897 --> 01:00:50,313
- Who me?

1234
01:00:50,398 --> 01:00:52,817
- I can't go with the crutches.

1235
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:56,112
All you gotta do is
just get near her,

1236
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:58,030
just call her name, and
she'll come right to you.

1237
01:00:58,113 --> 01:00:59,782
- Okay, well.

1238
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:01,158
- I'm sorry, but-

1239
01:01:04,537 --> 01:01:06,997
- All right, I'll
give it a shot.

1240
01:01:07,082 --> 01:01:08,415
- Thanks, I appreciate it.

1241
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:14,588
Thanks, just need to get near
her and say her name, Lovie.

1242
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:17,383
- Come on dog.

1243
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:24,015
- Don't chase after her.

1244
01:01:24,098 --> 01:01:25,683
If you chase her,
she's gonna run.

1245
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,563
- That's a boy.

1246
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:34,900
- He's back up.

1247
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:40,030
(comedic orchestral music)

1248
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:40,865
Come here.

1249
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,493
- Bloody dog, come on!

1250
01:01:44,577 --> 01:01:46,120
- Come.

1251
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:47,580
See, you're a real-sized dog.

1252
01:01:54,545 --> 01:01:55,880
No, lady, lady don't.

1253
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,552
Lady if you throw the ball,
she's gonna chase the ball.

1254
01:02:04,472 --> 01:02:06,682
- Uncle Ben, watch out!

1255
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:07,517
- Aah.

1256
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:15,442
(uptempo orchestral music)

1257
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,695
- 20 bucks says Uncle
Ben falls first.

1258
01:02:20,697 --> 01:02:22,240
- Uncle Daryl is going down.

1259
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:31,040
Dave, I just want to thank you

1260
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:33,835
for inviting me and my family
to join you for Christmas.

1261
01:02:33,918 --> 01:02:35,878
- I wouldn't have it
any other way Matt.

1262
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:37,672
- Me too, Dave.

1263
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:41,383
From me and the whole
McCormick family,

1264
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:42,885
Merry Christmas.

1265
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,262
- Here's to my son,

1266
01:02:44,345 --> 01:02:45,722
man of the house.

1267
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:48,723
Takes a lot of work
to have everybody in.

1268
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:50,225
He never complained.

1269
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:52,395
I'm proud of you, son.

1270
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:53,645
- Thank you.

1271
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,815
Everyone, thank you.

1272
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:58,067
Let's eat, dig in.

1273
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:02,988
- Boy oh boy oh boy,
that hit the spot.

1274
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:06,492
- Anybody gave me a
belt for Christmas?

1275
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,537
Who's ready for presents?

1276
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:12,290
- Ah, come on Dave, really?

1277
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:15,125
I think we need a little
nap before we can do that.

1278
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,460
Come on, let's go.

1279
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:34,353
- Santa can't deliver all
those presents in one night.

1280
01:03:34,437 --> 01:03:37,565
Do you know, how many houses
there are all over the world?

1281
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:39,567
- Okay, if I can
deliver presents

1282
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:42,903
to every house in this
block in 60 seconds or less,

1283
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:44,905
that'll prove that
it's possible.

1284
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:47,658
- I don't think that it does.

1285
01:03:47,742 --> 01:03:50,202
- Sure it does.

1286
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,037
- Three, two, one. Go!

1287
01:03:54,707 --> 01:03:56,958
(kids cheering)

1288
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:58,627
Go, go, go.

1289
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,503
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1290
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:21,108
- That's it.

1291
01:04:21,192 --> 01:04:22,192
That is it.

1292
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:24,778
I've had enough.

1293
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:28,950
(high-tension orchestral music)

1294
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,160
- Probably Daryl, he always
takes a (indistinct).

1295
01:04:34,205 --> 01:04:36,707
(muffled speaking)

1296
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:39,293
- Yeah, still putting
their names on things.

1297
01:04:39,377 --> 01:04:40,502
- We're having some drink.

1298
01:04:40,587 --> 01:04:41,337
- Oh, wow.

1299
01:04:44,632 --> 01:04:46,717
- Aah, that hit the spot.

1300
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:49,553
Let's open presents.

1301
01:04:50,805 --> 01:04:51,930
- Honey?

1302
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,848
You ready to open presents?

1303
01:04:53,933 --> 01:04:54,850
- [Woman] Almost.

1304
01:04:56,143 --> 01:04:57,937
- Quit stalling there, let's go.

1305
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:02,275
Kids! Presents!

1306
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:08,655
- [Woman] Yeah, I have a sponge.

1307
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,115
- I just took it.

1308
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:12,868
You know I'm not gonna use.

1309
01:05:12,952 --> 01:05:15,705
(crowd murmuring)

1310
01:05:18,707 --> 01:05:20,583
- [Mister Nicholas] David!

1311
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:23,087
David Madison, get out here.

1312
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:24,755
- I'll be right back.

1313
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:29,635
Wesley?

1314
01:05:29,718 --> 01:05:30,678
Merry Christmas.

1315
01:05:30,762 --> 01:05:34,890
- Put up your dukes,
you Yankee coward.

1316
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:35,725
Aah!

1317
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,730
- You think you Brits would
learn not to mess with America.

1318
01:05:40,813 --> 01:05:41,563
Geez.

1319
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,150
(door closing)

1320
01:05:44,233 --> 01:05:46,985
(crowd murmuring)

1321
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:50,865
- Oh, thanks dear.

1322
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:00,750
Oh, look.

1323
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,043
Oven mitts.

1324
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:05,587
- I didn't know what to get her.

1325
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:07,757
- Thanks dear.

1326
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:09,925
- Ben,

1327
01:06:11,177 --> 01:06:12,470
what is that?

1328
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:15,305
- It's Cabernet, fantastic wine.

1329
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,098
You guys want me
to get you some?

1330
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:18,600
- Ooh, no thank you,

1331
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:21,478
I just don't allow beverages
in the living room.

1332
01:06:21,562 --> 01:06:22,897
- I won't spill, so.

1333
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,232
- Oh well, it's just the rule.

1334
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,860
Just sort of a house rule.

1335
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:29,945
- I assure you, I am very good

1336
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,738
with beverage management, Sandy.

1337
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:38,287
(gasping)

1338
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,915
- Oh, did you sew this yourself?

1339
01:06:40,998 --> 01:06:42,417
- I did.

1340
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,585
- Thank you so much.

1341
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:45,418
- You're welcome.

1342
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:48,505
- I picked out the fabric.

1343
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:50,842
- Thank you.

1344
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,553
So pretty.

1345
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:57,848
- Don't ever do that again.

1346
01:06:57,932 --> 01:07:01,393
(bright instrumental music)

1347
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:06,273
("Deck the Halls")

1348
01:07:32,592 --> 01:07:33,883
- It's for you Aunt Carol.

1349
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:36,887
- Thank you, honey.

1350
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:40,473
It's-

1351
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:43,352
- Because it's Christmas
and your birthday.

1352
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:44,187
- Yeah.

1353
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:45,645
- And you're 50.

1354
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:47,773
- Yeah.

1355
01:07:47,857 --> 01:07:49,483
- It's a sign for the yard.

1356
01:07:49,567 --> 01:07:50,818
I'm gonna go put it out.

1357
01:07:50,902 --> 01:07:53,028
- It's okay sweetie,
we can do it later.

1358
01:07:53,862 --> 01:07:55,990
(sighing)

1359
01:07:56,073 --> 01:07:57,450
- And you're 50.

1360
01:07:58,492 --> 01:08:01,120
(laughing)

1361
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:02,788
- Cut it out, dad.

1362
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:18,803
- Honestly?

1363
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:20,848
Is this really necessary?

1364
01:08:20,932 --> 01:08:21,932
I know it's my birthday.

1365
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:23,183
- And you're 50.

1366
01:08:23,267 --> 01:08:24,977
- [Carol] I've heard.

1367
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:26,020
- Okay, I'm opening.

1368
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:27,437
Whose it from anyway?

1369
01:08:27,522 --> 01:08:28,230
- Me, Uncle Matt.

1370
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:29,982
- Oh, thanks sweetie.

1371
01:08:30,942 --> 01:08:32,943
And it's a tie.

1372
01:08:33,027 --> 01:08:33,777
Thank you.

1373
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:35,905
- Let's see it.

1374
01:08:35,988 --> 01:08:38,573
- Yeah, no, that's all right.

1375
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:39,617
- Let's see.

1376
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:48,083
- Do you like it, dad?

1377
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,003
- Try it on.

1378
01:08:52,713 --> 01:08:53,463
- What?

1379
01:08:53,547 --> 01:08:55,048
- Go on.

1380
01:08:55,132 --> 01:08:56,092
Well, I'm already wearing-

1381
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:57,927
- Try it on, Matt.

1382
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:59,178
- All right.

1383
01:08:59,262 --> 01:09:00,553
All right, birthday girl.

1384
01:09:04,183 --> 01:09:07,603
(uptempo holiday music)

1385
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,125
- Let's give him a suplex.

1386
01:09:31,335 --> 01:09:33,753
Go, go, go.

1387
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:35,088
- And that Ben,

1388
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:37,465
is why we have a no beverages
in the living room policy.

1389
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:38,800
- I'm just standing here.

1390
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,970
- And now there's
wine on my carpet.

1391
01:09:41,053 --> 01:09:43,930
- Maybe you should have a
no full contact wrestling

1392
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:46,683
in the living room
policy, Sandy.

1393
01:09:46,767 --> 01:09:49,228
- Looks like you got little
wine on you there partner.

1394
01:09:49,312 --> 01:09:50,897
- Yeah, little wine.

1395
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:53,690
- That's why it's
good to have two ties.

1396
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:54,650
That's gonna stain.

1397
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:58,445
- All right kids, that's it.

1398
01:09:58,528 --> 01:09:59,613
Let's round up.

1399
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:01,948
Everybody to bed.

1400
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:04,033
Let's go, yeah, yeah!

1401
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,245
Yeah yeah!

1402
01:10:09,248 --> 01:10:11,000
Okay, let's get the drinks.

1403
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:12,208
- Yes, all right.

1404
01:10:15,212 --> 01:10:16,588
- Let's go, cowpoke.

1405
01:10:16,672 --> 01:10:19,550
(laughing)

1406
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:21,343
- "Twas the night
before Christmas,

1407
01:10:21,427 --> 01:10:23,178
and all through the house,

1408
01:10:23,262 --> 01:10:25,097
not a creature was stirring,

1409
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:26,682
not even a mouse.

1410
01:10:26,765 --> 01:10:30,060
The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,

1411
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:33,480
in hopes that Saint Nicholas
soon would be there.

1412
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:36,858
The children were nestled all
snug in their wee little beds,

1413
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:39,027
while visions of sugar plums

1414
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,280
danced in their
wee little heads.

1415
01:10:41,363 --> 01:10:43,657
Mama in her kerchief,
and I in my cap,

1416
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:48,620
Had just settled our brains
for a long winter's nap.

1417
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:51,623
When out on the lawn there
arose such a clatter,

1418
01:10:51,707 --> 01:10:54,585
I sprang from my bed to
see what was the matter.

1419
01:10:54,668 --> 01:10:57,378
Away to the window
I flew like a flash,

1420
01:10:57,462 --> 01:10:59,130
tore open the shutters,

1421
01:11:01,342 --> 01:11:03,385
threw open the sash.

1422
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:06,055
The moon on the breast
of the new-fallen snow

1423
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:11,018
gave a luster of midday
to objects below.

1424
01:11:11,102 --> 01:11:13,437
When what to my wondering
eyes should appear,

1425
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,942
but a miniature sleigh
and eight tiny reindeer.

1426
01:11:18,025 --> 01:11:21,195
With a little old driver
so lively and quick,

1427
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:24,823
I knew in a moment that
it must be Saint Nick,

1428
01:11:26,492 --> 01:11:30,412
and he whistled and shouted
and called them by name.

1429
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:35,458
Happy Christmas to all,
and to all a good night."

1430
01:11:36,293 --> 01:11:37,168
- You skipped some, Grandpa.

1431
01:11:37,252 --> 01:11:39,547
- Well, you got the gist of it.

1432
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:42,257
Well, Grandpa loves you all.

1433
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,092
Good night.

1434
01:11:46,345 --> 01:11:48,138
- Hey, we're going to bed.

1435
01:11:48,222 --> 01:11:48,888
- Good night.

1436
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:50,015
- Good night.

1437
01:11:55,187 --> 01:11:57,732
- I'm going out for little walk.

1438
01:12:10,202 --> 01:12:13,622
(footsteps on the roof)

1439
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,293
- Wake up, wake up!

1440
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:19,210
- What?

1441
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:20,295
- He's here, he's really here.

1442
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:23,173
- I knew it, I knew
Santa Claus is real.

1443
01:12:23,257 --> 01:12:24,298
- It's true, and tomorrow

1444
01:12:24,383 --> 01:12:26,927
I'm gonna get a
puppy for Christmas.

1445
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:29,430
I'm gonna get a
puppy for Christmas.

1446
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,225
- On Dancer, on Prancer,

1447
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,228
dash away Richard Nixon,

1448
01:12:36,312 --> 01:12:39,398
NFL blitzin' and however
the heck it goes.

1449
01:12:39,482 --> 01:12:43,860
All led by a drunk reindeer
with a big red nose.

1450
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:52,160
- You're taking
up all the space.

1451
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:54,370
I need a spot for my
kid too, you know.

1452
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:56,248
- What about in there?

1453
01:12:56,332 --> 01:12:57,290
- Yeah.

1454
01:12:58,292 --> 01:13:00,585
- What? Under the kitchen table?

1455
01:13:01,837 --> 01:13:02,628
- Sure.

1456
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:04,923
- Yeah.

1457
01:13:05,007 --> 01:13:07,300
- You trying to invent
a new holiday, Matt?

1458
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:10,387
Santa is not bringing
presents to Kassandra,

1459
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:11,722
under the table.

1460
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:14,265
- But, we're all set up
and we were here first.

1461
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:16,685
- You're like Columbus
talking to the Indians.

1462
01:13:16,768 --> 01:13:18,103
This is my home.

1463
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,273
Now, I'm gonna go
out to the trunk,

1464
01:13:21,357 --> 01:13:22,273
I'm gonna get Santa's presents,

1465
01:13:22,357 --> 01:13:24,025
And when I come back,

1466
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:27,320
there's gonna be a nice
big space under that tree.

1467
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:29,823
Okay?

1468
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:52,428
(playful music)

1469
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:04,315
- A drunken reindeer
with a big red nose.

1470
01:14:06,735 --> 01:14:08,362
- Pretty nice table.

1471
01:14:08,445 --> 01:14:09,195
- Yeah.

1472
01:14:10,322 --> 01:14:11,615
- Told Carol I'd be right up.

1473
01:14:13,408 --> 01:14:16,035
- We could just
play one quick game.

1474
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:20,582
- All right.
- But I'm first.

1475
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:24,043
(uptempo comedic music)

1476
01:14:26,588 --> 01:14:29,423
(yelling)

1477
01:14:29,508 --> 01:14:31,092
- Another Christmas down,

1478
01:14:31,177 --> 01:14:35,430
another family Christmas
through the hole.

1479
01:14:35,513 --> 01:14:37,515
(yelling)

1480
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:41,228
- She is my sister.

1481
01:14:41,312 --> 01:14:42,312
- What?

1482
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:43,772
- She's also cold.

1483
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:46,733
(yelling)

1484
01:14:46,817 --> 01:14:49,193
(laughing)

1485
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,077
- Be there.

1486
01:14:58,578 --> 01:15:00,163
- No. No.

1487
01:15:00,247 --> 01:15:03,333
- Bring it up, just bring
it at me one more time.

1488
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:05,668
(grunting)

1489
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:11,258
(confused crosstalk)

1490
01:15:11,342 --> 01:15:13,552
- Come on, put it in there bro.

1491
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:18,932
- One more.

1492
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:21,435
One more, I know, one more.

1493
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,607
(cheering)

1494
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:30,110
Okay, one more, Ben.

1495
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:31,237
Double digit.

1496
01:15:32,237 --> 01:15:34,405
(mumbling)

1497
01:15:40,828 --> 01:15:42,330
- Wait for it.

1498
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:43,707
Wait for it.

1499
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:46,042
There it is Ben.

1500
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,963

(light music)

1519
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:42,015
You know,

1520
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:43,517
I spend a lot time asking people

1521
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,435
what they would
like for Christmas.

1522
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:48,313
May be I could tell
you what I would like.

1523
01:16:48,397 --> 01:16:50,565
Spend a little less on presents,

1524
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:52,400
and give a little
more to charity.

1525
01:16:53,527 --> 01:16:55,487
Be kind to one another
because really,

1526
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:58,240
that is what Christmas
is all about.

1527
01:16:58,323 --> 01:17:00,408
Now, here it is folks.

1528
01:17:00,492 --> 01:17:01,410
The main event,

1529
01:17:01,493 --> 01:17:03,578
live from Rockford, Michigan.

1530
01:17:03,662 --> 01:17:05,080
It's Christmas morning.

1531
01:17:07,207 --> 01:17:08,417
Ho ho ho!

1532
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:12,420
(dramatic orchestral music)

1533
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,515
- Guys, wake up, wake up.

1534
01:17:23,598 --> 01:17:26,435
Presents! It's
time for presents!

1535
01:17:26,518 --> 01:17:29,062
(festive music)

1536
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:01,845
- They're up.

1537
01:18:04,555 --> 01:18:06,725
Come on, cowpoke, lets go.

1538
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:09,185
- Couple more hours.

1539
01:18:11,397 --> 01:18:13,732
- You are not missing
Christmas morning.

1540
01:18:13,815 --> 01:18:16,067
- There's a camcorder
in the closet.

1541
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:17,110
Videotape it.

1542
01:18:19,237 --> 01:18:20,030
- David,

1543
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:21,782
up!

1544
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,328
(kids chattering)

1545
01:18:51,645 --> 01:18:52,687
- Coffee.

1546
01:18:57,192 --> 01:18:57,983
Coffee.

1547
01:19:00,237 --> 01:19:03,157
- Matt, can you
make a fire, please?

1548
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:05,825
Matt?

1549
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:08,245
- Jeez, what?

1550
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:09,412
- Make a fire please.

1551
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:12,123
- Okay.

1552
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:14,877
- Now, Matt?

1553
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:17,587
- Okay.

1554
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,673
(kids chattering)

1555
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:26,303
All right, move over.

1556
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,433
You too, get something to eat.

1557
01:19:39,317 --> 01:19:40,860
We'll have a fire mind you.

1558
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:45,115
It's 78 degrees in here.

1559
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:48,535
(Grandpa yelling)

1560
01:19:48,618 --> 01:19:50,662
- Mister Madison?

1561
01:19:50,745 --> 01:19:52,205
- Dad?

1562
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:53,832
- I'm stuck in the chimney.

1563
01:19:53,915 --> 01:19:55,583
- Sandy!
(screaming)

1564
01:19:55,667 --> 01:19:56,835
Call 911!

1565
01:19:56,918 --> 01:19:58,127
- [Grandpa] Freezing
my rear end off.

1566
01:19:58,212 --> 01:20:00,588
- Mister Madison, what
are you doing up there?

1567
01:20:00,672 --> 01:20:02,882
- Get me the hell out of here,

1568
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:07,720
then we can play
twenty questions with
my idiot son-in-law.

1569
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:10,640
(siren winding down)

1570
01:20:12,142 --> 01:20:13,893
- [Santa] That Grandpa is
quite the character, isn't he?

1571
01:20:13,977 --> 01:20:16,730
Ho ho ho, as long
as I can remember,

1572
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:18,565
he's been one of my favorites.

1573
01:20:18,648 --> 01:20:21,108
Oh, he's gone a little
gruff in his old age.

1574
01:20:21,192 --> 01:20:22,985
But he loves his family.

1575
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,487
That's what's important.

1576
01:20:27,157 --> 01:20:28,700
- Just all kinds of stuff.

1577
01:20:28,783 --> 01:20:29,868
Just clutter.

1578
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:31,493
The gifts are too big,

1579
01:20:31,578 --> 01:20:32,912
and nobody really needs them.

1580
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:36,332
- What can I say?

1581
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:39,085
I like the gifts though.

1582
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,795
- Matt?
- Huh?

1583
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,672
Yeah, sure, hon.

1584
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:45,008
- Now look, I've put
everybody's name in the hat.

1585
01:20:45,092 --> 01:20:46,718
We'll each draw out a name,

1586
01:20:46,802 --> 01:20:48,262
and that's the person you're
buying a gift for next year.

1587
01:20:48,345 --> 01:20:50,388
- I's Christmas day, Carol.

1588
01:20:50,472 --> 01:20:52,432
Do we really need to
worry about it now?

1589
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,268
- Yes, when else
will all be together?

1590
01:20:55,352 --> 01:20:56,895
If we don't talk about it now,

1591
01:20:56,978 --> 01:20:58,187
it will never get done.

1592
01:20:58,272 --> 01:21:00,232
Daryl, you get to go first.

1593
01:21:04,152 --> 01:21:05,820
- I got my name,
Daryl McCormick.

1594
01:21:08,782 --> 01:21:10,408
- There you go, you can buy
yourself some orange soda,

1595
01:21:10,492 --> 01:21:11,743
and put your name on it.

1596
01:21:14,162 --> 01:21:14,955
- Or oven mitts.

1597
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:33,848
- You feeling better, Grandpa?

1598
01:21:33,932 --> 01:21:36,517
- Ah, me? Sure, sure.

1599
01:21:36,602 --> 01:21:37,768
Takes a lot more than that

1600
01:21:37,852 --> 01:21:39,687
to knock your old
Grandpa off his game.

1601
01:21:41,982 --> 01:21:43,107
How'd you do this year?

1602
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:44,692
You make out?

1603
01:21:44,775 --> 01:21:46,235
- Okay, I guess.

1604
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:47,737
- Okay, you guess?

1605
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:49,280
- I don't wanna complain.

1606
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:52,825
- You mean you didn't get
everything you wanted?

1607
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:55,912
Well, maybe next year.

1608
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:57,747
- No.

1609
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:58,790
- No!

1610
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:01,250
- I was really good this year.

1611
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:02,502
Really, I was.

1612
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:05,005
And that's all I wanted.

1613
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:08,550
And if Santa Claus didn't
bring me a dog this year,

1614
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:09,800
why would he next year?

1615
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:13,305
- Well, maybe your
parents for your birthday.

1616
01:22:13,388 --> 01:22:14,430
- They never will.

1617
01:22:15,682 --> 01:22:17,850
I just thought, if
I was good enough

1618
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,768
and if I wanted it bad.

1619
01:22:20,728 --> 01:22:21,897
- Well, I'm sorry.

1620
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:24,273
You know, I did as best I could.

1621
01:22:25,192 --> 01:22:26,860
- I still love you, Grandpa.

1622
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:28,528
(Grandpa chuckling)

1623
01:22:28,612 --> 01:22:29,528
- What was that?

1624
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:30,322
- What?

1625
01:22:30,405 --> 01:22:31,155
- That noise.

1626
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:33,867
- I don't hear anything.

1627
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:35,410
- From the basement that

1628
01:22:35,493 --> 01:22:37,787
whining, barking sound.

1629
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:41,917
(building orchestral music)

1630
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,087
(bright orchestral music)

1631
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,797
- [Kassandra] A
puppy! I got a puppy!

1632
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,340
I don't believe this.

1633
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:51,092
- Dad, what's going on?

1634
01:22:52,427 --> 01:22:53,345
- [Kassandra] I
don't believe this.

1635
01:22:53,428 --> 01:22:54,762
- [Grandpa] What's the big deal?

1636
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:57,348
- You can't just buy her a
dog without our permission.

1637
01:22:57,432 --> 01:22:58,683
- Unbelievable.

1638
01:22:58,767 --> 01:23:00,435
- [Grandpa] You had a
dog when you were a kid.

1639
01:23:00,518 --> 01:23:02,062
Every kid should have a dog.

1640
01:23:02,145 --> 01:23:03,855
- Do you even know
what kind it is?

1641
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:05,482
It's a, it's a, well it's,

1642
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:07,233
I don't know.

1643
01:23:07,317 --> 01:23:09,068
I told the guy to get a big dog,

1644
01:23:09,152 --> 01:23:11,112
you don't want those
little rat dogs.

1645
01:23:11,195 --> 01:23:13,823
- This is a major
family decision, Dad.

1646
01:23:13,907 --> 01:23:15,408
A dog is a lot of work.

1647
01:23:15,492 --> 01:23:19,620
- Nonsense, you always
over-dramatize everything.

1648
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:20,872
(dog yelping)

1649
01:23:20,955 --> 01:23:22,832
- [Carol] No, don't let him up

1650
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:23,625
- [Kid] That knee, it's bad.

1651
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:24,917
- [David] Get off there!

1652
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,753
(dog yelping)

1653
01:23:26,837 --> 01:23:28,463
Down, come here.

1654
01:23:28,547 --> 01:23:32,175
(talking over each other)

1655
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:33,885
Get off there!

1656
01:23:33,968 --> 01:23:35,137
- [Sandy] David, do something!

1657
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:37,930
- [David] I got him, I got him.

1658
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:44,520
- [Sandy] Oh, my
china. (sighing)

1659
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:45,855
- So, there you have it.

1660
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:48,608
The Madisons got a
dog for Christmas.

1661
01:23:48,692 --> 01:23:50,652
Dave and Sandy may not
have wanted him at first,

1662
01:23:50,735 --> 01:23:51,903
but, throughout the years,

1663
01:23:51,987 --> 01:23:54,280
that dog brought a lot of love

1664
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:55,740
into the Madison home.

1665
01:23:57,492 --> 01:23:59,035
Dave swore that he would never

1666
01:23:59,118 --> 01:24:02,622
have any of his or Sandy's
family over ever again.

1667
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:03,623
Well, you know Dave,

1668
01:24:03,707 --> 01:24:05,833
next year he was
excited as ever.

1669
01:24:07,002 --> 01:24:08,795
It wasn't always easy.

1670
01:24:08,878 --> 01:24:10,338
One year, Dave got kicked

1671
01:24:10,422 --> 01:24:11,547
while trying to set up

1672
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,758
a live reindeer display
in the front yard.

1673
01:24:13,842 --> 01:24:16,343
Then there was the time
he nearly froze to death,

1674
01:24:16,427 --> 01:24:17,970
while trying to prove to Sandy

1675
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,848
that the ice was thick
enough for skating.

1676
01:24:20,932 --> 01:24:21,933
(chuckling)

1677
01:24:22,017 --> 01:24:24,810
Well, over time,

1678
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:27,897
we gained a few new
Madisons and well,

1679
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,482
we lost an older one.

1680
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:33,152
But the family and their loving
dog always stayed together.

1681
01:24:34,362 --> 01:24:36,613
From all of us here
at Rockford, Michigan,

1682
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:38,115
Merry Christmas,

1683
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:40,160
and to all a good night.

1684
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:45,332
(festive orchestral music)
