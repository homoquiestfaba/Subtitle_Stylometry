367
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,976
(coughing, gasping)

368
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:07,477
- Enough?
- (gasping): Enough.

369
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,877
Huh?

370
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,482
- Come on, fight me! Come on!
- (gasps)

371
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:14,217
(grunts, coughs)

372
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:17,254
You have no idea how much pain
I'm gonna wreak on you.

373
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:19,556
- Do it. Do it!
- DUCHESS: Stop!

374
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:22,092
She needs to be
taught a lesson.

375
00:21:24,427 --> 00:21:26,895
(gasping)

376
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:29,132
I heard her screams
from the hall.

377
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:33,370
Men knew what you were
doing to her, they'd hang you.

378
00:21:33,403 --> 00:21:34,504
(chuckles softly)

379
00:21:34,537 --> 00:21:36,772
I have extra rope
if they're short.

380
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:40,843
Not another word.

381
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:43,313
Sober her up and talk to her.

382
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:45,248
- You understand?
- Yeah.

383
00:21:45,282 --> 00:21:47,550
DUCHESS: Coffee and bread
are on their way up.

384
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:49,185
Make sure she takes it in.

385
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:51,521
I need her ready to work
in two hours.

386
00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:54,291
Not a mark on her.

387
00:21:54,324 --> 00:21:55,958
Not a mark.

388
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:01,197
(sniffles)

389
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:13,809
(knock on door)

390
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,212
ANGEL:
It's open.

391
00:22:25,622 --> 00:22:27,257
(door closes)

392
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,193
What's your pleasure, mister?

393
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:33,063
(clears throat)

394
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:38,068
Doesn't matter in here
if you're married.

395
00:22:38,668 --> 00:22:41,204
Doesn't matter if your...
(chuckles)

396
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:44,074
Christian mama doesn't approve.

397
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:48,311
There's no guilt in here, okay?

398
00:22:49,112 --> 00:22:52,982
Just pleasure. So don't be shy.
Tell me what you want.

399
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:56,919
You.

400
00:22:57,554 --> 00:22:59,322
I'm all yours.

401
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,294
(Angel sighs)

402
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:06,996
Why don't you come over here
and I'll wash you.

403
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:11,368
(chuckles)

404
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:13,336
I'm not gonna hurt you,
I promise.

405
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,504
(Michael stammers)

406
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:16,406
That won't be necessary, ma'am.

407
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:18,441
"Ma'am"?

408
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:20,043
Do I look like your mama?

409
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:21,877
No, ma'am. (chuckles)

410
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:24,114
No.

411
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:27,417
You do not.

412
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:32,322
The truth is, I...

413
00:23:32,355 --> 00:23:34,691
I didn't come here for... that.

414
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:36,326
ANGEL:
Yeah?

415
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:38,894
MICHAEL: I just came here
to talk to you.

416
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:44,167
You want to talk?

417
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:48,471
There's a nice barkeep
named Murphy downstairs.

418
00:23:48,505 --> 00:23:50,673
He'll talk your ear off.

419
00:23:50,707 --> 00:23:52,308
(chuckles)

420
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:05,355
(clears throat)

421
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:11,194
Y-You-you... you live
in this room?

422
00:24:11,227 --> 00:24:12,162
No.

423
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:14,497
My little white house
surrounded by roses

424
00:24:14,531 --> 00:24:17,534
on top of the hill
is where I prefer to stay.

425
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:21,037
I shouldn't have come this way.
(chuckles)

426
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:24,007
(chuckles):
What other way is there?

427
00:24:24,641 --> 00:24:26,976
Uh, I ain't sure.

428
00:24:31,514 --> 00:24:33,049
How old are you?

429
00:24:34,284 --> 00:24:36,486
I'm real old. How old are you?

430
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,254
T-Twenty-six.

431
00:24:39,622 --> 00:24:41,090
Ancient for a gold miner.

432
00:24:41,124 --> 00:24:44,561
Oh, s... no, no, see.
I-I ain't a miner.

433
00:24:44,594 --> 00:24:46,463
I-I work on a farm.

434
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:54,204
Angel your real name?
(chuckles)

435
00:24:54,237 --> 00:24:57,140
You can call me
whatever you want.

436
00:24:58,508 --> 00:25:00,076
Well, my name is...

437
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:02,312
I don't want to know your name.

438
00:25:03,613 --> 00:25:05,315
Michael Hosea.

439
00:25:05,348 --> 00:25:06,282
(sighs)

440
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:08,284
Are you afraid of
what your wife might think

441
00:25:08,318 --> 00:25:10,153
if you have your way with me?

442
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:12,155
Wife. (chuckles)

443
00:25:12,188 --> 00:25:14,023
No, see, 'cause, uh...
(clears throat)

444
00:25:14,057 --> 00:25:16,626
I'm not married.

445
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:18,194
(sighs)

446
00:25:18,228 --> 00:25:19,729
But I will be soon.

447
00:25:19,762 --> 00:25:22,632
Then come over here and get
your last taste of freedom

448
00:25:22,665 --> 00:25:24,501
while you can.

449
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:27,637
Oh, no, I can't, you see,
'cause I'm...

450
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,073
- gonna marry you.
- Mm.

451
00:25:30,106 --> 00:25:32,175
You're gonna marry me?

452
00:25:33,076 --> 00:25:35,745
Take me away from here,
give me the life I deserve?

453
00:25:35,778 --> 00:25:38,014
Mm-hmm.

454
00:25:40,316 --> 00:25:42,652
You're my fifth proposal
this week.

455
00:25:43,353 --> 00:25:47,290
How about we do what's on
your mind and we call it a day?

456
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:51,094
I'm gonna give you a good life.

457
00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:55,431
Come on. Come away with me.

458
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,675
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

459
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:06,809
Time's up.

460
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:08,545
Come on.

461
00:26:08,578 --> 00:26:10,179
(chuckles)

462
00:26:11,514 --> 00:26:12,782
I'm coming back.

463
00:26:12,815 --> 00:26:16,553
All-all I ask for is-is-is
one honest half hour.

464
00:26:16,586 --> 00:26:19,155
Five minutes with me,
you'd run like the devil.

465
00:26:19,188 --> 00:26:20,523
Angel, Angel...

466
00:26:20,557 --> 00:26:22,559
(sighs)

467
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,627
(women giggling)

468
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:26,529
- (crickets chirping)
- (indistinct chatter)

469
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:28,831
Next time I pray to God
for a woman to share my life,

470
00:26:28,865 --> 00:26:33,303
I'm gonna be
a lot more specific.

471
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:34,671
ANGEL:
<i>So you won</i>

472
00:26:34,704 --> 00:26:37,273
- the lottery again?
- (Michael chuckles)

473
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:39,642
I paid double again.

474
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:41,144
(Angel laughs)

475
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:43,112
Lucky me.

476
00:26:44,147 --> 00:26:47,317
I do hate to see you just waste
your time and gold dust

477
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,686
just... just chatting.

478
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:53,323
Do you want to stay here
for the rest of your life?

479
00:26:53,356 --> 00:26:55,558
I don't think that's really
any of your business.

480
00:26:55,592 --> 00:26:58,528
It was my business the minute
I saw you on the street.

481
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:00,463
Yeah, love at first sight,
right?

482
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:02,098
Right.

483
00:27:02,765 --> 00:27:04,601
(yawns)

484
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:06,536
Oh, sorry. What, am I
putting you to sleep now?

485
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:10,173
All this talking is exhausting
to be honest.

486
00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:12,575
So you'd rather
I join you on the bed?

487
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:14,510
At least you would've
left having gotten something

488
00:27:14,544 --> 00:27:17,213
- for your gold dust.
- (chuckles softly)

489
00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:24,654
Let me get you
out of this place.

490
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:28,257
I'm serious.

491
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:34,631
Marry me.

492
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:38,234
(pounding on door)

493
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:39,335
MAGOWAN:
Time's up.

494
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:42,472
Get your boots on. It's...

495
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,708
- (indistinct chatter)
- (piano playing)

496
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,345
It's time for you to go.

497
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,282
Nice talking to you.

498
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,386
(indistinct chatter)

499
00:27:57,286 --> 00:27:58,921
She said no, again.

500
00:27:58,955 --> 00:28:00,423
- JOSEPH: Shocking.
- (chuckles)

501
00:28:00,456 --> 00:28:01,691
MICHAEL:
I don't know.

502
00:28:01,724 --> 00:28:05,194
Got enough gold dust
for one more try.

503
00:28:05,228 --> 00:28:06,629
JOSEPH:
Maybe you need a new plan.

504
00:28:06,663 --> 00:28:08,264
- (Michael laughs)
- Buy some cattle.

505
00:28:08,297 --> 00:28:10,266
It might've been cheaper.

506
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:11,968
Go home, Michael.

507
00:28:12,002 --> 00:28:13,670
Work your farm.

508
00:28:14,437 --> 00:28:17,507
Ain't no woman worth
that amount of gold.

509
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:20,677
Mm.

510
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,713
REBECCA: Angel, who's the man
you were with last night?

511
00:28:23,746 --> 00:28:24,714
Which one?

512
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:26,516
The good-looking one.

513
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:29,452
- All look the same to me.
- (chuckles)

514
00:28:29,485 --> 00:28:33,823
Six feet, dark hair, blue eyes.

515
00:28:33,856 --> 00:28:35,692
- (chuckles softly)
- When he smiled at me,

516
00:28:35,725 --> 00:28:37,660
I could feel it
all the way down to my toes.

517
00:28:37,694 --> 00:28:40,296
LUCKY: A pot-marked midget from
Nantucket could smile at you,

518
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:42,331
and you'd feel it
all the way down to your toes.

519
00:28:42,365 --> 00:28:43,633
Drink your brandy, Lucky.

520
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:45,501
- No one was talking to you.
- (laughs softly)

521
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:47,570
I've had one untried boy
after another.

522
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:49,605
I would like to give
a real man a go.

523
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:51,340
RENEE: Duchess said
one glass per girl.

524
00:28:51,374 --> 00:28:53,609
Milk's expensive.

525
00:28:57,014 --> 00:29:00,483
So, you really don't care
about him, Angel?

526
00:29:04,687 --> 00:29:06,489
You can have him.

527
00:29:06,522 --> 00:29:08,758
You'd be doing me a huge favor.

528
00:29:11,794 --> 00:29:14,363
- (lively chatter, laughter)
- (piano playing)

529
00:29:23,606 --> 00:29:25,308
- Hey.
- (chuckles)

530
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:27,343
(clears throat)

531
00:29:27,376 --> 00:29:29,679
Don't bother with Angel
tonight, sugar.

532
00:29:29,712 --> 00:29:32,582
She wanted me to tell you that
you'd like me a lot better.

533
00:29:32,615 --> 00:29:33,883
(chuckles)

534
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:35,918
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

535
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:37,386
What else did Angel say?

536
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,656
That I'd be doing her
a huge favor

537
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:43,793
to take the farmer boy
off her hands.

538
00:29:44,894 --> 00:29:45,996
She said that?

539
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:47,497
Yes.

540
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,032
Never been with a woman
like me before.

541
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:51,901
And as far as I can tell, I
never been with a man like you.

542
00:29:51,934 --> 00:29:53,336

725
00:42:10,073 --> 00:42:12,709
I was just thinking
about my mother.

726
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:15,144
What was she like?

727
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,548
Beautiful.

728
00:42:21,651 --> 00:42:23,419
Shattered.

729
00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:27,557
You're clammy.

730
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,259
I have a headache.

731
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:30,560
How long's it been aching?

732
00:42:30,593 --> 00:42:32,128
(sighs)

733
00:42:32,161 --> 00:42:34,197
Ever since that...

734
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:37,166
- farmer started badgering me.
- (chuckles)

735
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,536
And you're sorry
you didn't go with him?

736
00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:41,304
(whispers):
No.

737
00:42:41,337 --> 00:42:43,673
No. No man is gonna own me.

738
00:42:43,706 --> 00:42:45,608
(sighs) Yeah.

739
00:42:45,642 --> 00:42:47,443
The Duchess wouldn't have
let you go anyway.

740
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:49,379
(scoffs)
She can't keep me here.

741
00:42:49,412 --> 00:42:51,648
(scoffs) Like hell she can't.

742
00:42:51,681 --> 00:42:53,516
No, we have a deal.

743
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:56,519
She holds my money, and then
when I'm ready, I walk.

744
00:42:56,553 --> 00:42:59,088
The only girls
who leave here are too old,

745
00:42:59,122 --> 00:43:02,258

752
00:43:21,277 --> 00:43:22,545

753
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:24,781
(scoffs) Nonsense.

754
00:43:24,814 --> 00:43:26,482
Sit down, darling.

755
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:29,385
I heard you missed breakfast.
Would you like something?

756
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,525
I want my gold.

757
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:38,261
(chuckles)
And why do you want it?

758
00:43:38,294 --> 00:43:41,664
- Because it belongs to me.
- Mm.

759
00:43:42,665 --> 00:43:44,334
Pour yourself some coffee.

760
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:46,703
I don't want coffee.
I want my gold.

761
00:43:46,736 --> 00:43:47,904

762
00:43:47,937 --> 00:43:50,506
Tell me,
why do you want your gold?

763
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,710
I would like to leave,
get my own place.

764

DUCHESS:
Mm.

765
00:43:55,244 --> 00:43:57,213
Getting ambitious, are you?

766
00:43:57,246 --> 00:43:58,648
Trying to compete against me.

767
00:43:58,681 --> 00:44:00,183
(chuckles):
No.

768
00:44:00,216 --> 00:44:01,451
Be a hundred miles
from this place.

769
00:44:01,484 --> 00:44:02,585
You don't have to worry
about me.

770
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:05,755
I just would like
to be left alone.

771
00:44:05,788 --> 00:44:07,457
I take good care of you,
don't I?

772
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,325
Huh?

773
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,294
You'd be one woman
fighting off a hundred men.

774
00:44:11,327 --> 00:44:13,529
How long would you last?

775
00:44:14,764 --> 00:44:16,933
Maybe I'll get...

776
00:44:16,966 --> 00:44:19,302
- married or something.
- (laughs)

777
00:44:19,335 --> 00:44:22,405
(laughing):
You fancy doing laundry

778
00:44:22,438 --> 00:44:23,940
and cooking for a man

779
00:44:23,973 --> 00:44:27,677
and giving him sex whenever
and however he wants for free?

780
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:30,713
You know how to make a man
happy for 30 minutes.

781
00:44:30,747 --> 00:44:31,814
That's all you're good at.

782
00:44:31,848 --> 00:44:33,416
I want my gold, Duchess.

783
00:44:33,449 --> 00:44:35,418
You are forgetting
what I do for you.

784
00:44:36,252 --> 00:44:38,254
Everything costs money.

785
00:44:38,287 --> 00:44:39,722
You wear silk in a mining town.

786
00:44:39,756 --> 00:44:41,958
I provide protection for you.
I feed you.

787
00:44:41,992 --> 00:44:43,760
You live in a nice building.

788
00:44:43,793 --> 00:44:45,662
Is my name on the deed?

789
00:44:47,664 --> 00:44:49,666
- What did you say?
- You have coffee

790
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:51,334
with cream and sugar,

791
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:55,405
pastry from
that baker down the street

792
00:44:55,438 --> 00:44:58,241
and three eggs
and a steak on your...

793
00:44:58,841 --> 00:44:59,977
...your fine china.

794
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,311
I had oatmeal for breakfast

795
00:45:02,345 --> 00:45:04,580
with two glasses of milk,
rationed.

796
00:45:05,415 --> 00:45:07,483
How many men...

797
00:45:09,485 --> 00:45:12,588
...did I have to have sex with
so you could have this?

798
00:45:14,557 --> 00:45:17,694
You stuff yourself like a pig
and you dress up like royalty!

799
00:45:17,727 --> 00:45:19,228
A duchess?

800
00:45:19,262 --> 00:45:21,597
A duchess of what?!

801
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:23,399
Men don't even pay
to have sex with you anymore.

802
00:45:23,433 --> 00:45:24,934
You have to pay Magowan
to have sex with you.

804
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:28,571

I found you, missy.

805
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:33,276
In an alley, covered with mud,
broke and beaten bloody.

806
00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:35,344
I made you a princess.

807
00:45:35,378 --> 00:45:36,713
I can take it all away.

808
00:45:36,746 --> 00:45:38,614

815
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:49,325
That teacup came around
the Horn from England.

816
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:51,828
I'll add the cost of it
to your debt.

817

My debt?

818
00:45:55,431 --> 00:45:56,833
Magowan will take you
to your room

819
00:45:56,866 --> 00:45:58,868
so you can discuss further
those thoughts you have

820
