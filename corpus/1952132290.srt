1
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,564
"Scratch and win," my ass.

2
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,440
Have better luck
scratchin' my balls.

3
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,569
Man, will you quit doing that?

4
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,705
Man, you know the plan.

5
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,840
Get the big money.
Get out this joint.

6
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,007
Start my
own business.

7
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,947
Right?

8
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,012
- Damn!
- I ain't going back up there.

9
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,119
No, I'm not.

10
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,820
I hate this job.

11
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,423
Damn, Franklin.

12
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,594
You got to warn us
before you walk up like that.

13
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,596
He was scared.

14
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,337
Franklin, what you doing?
You need somethin'?

15
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,513
Looking for a body.

16
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,380
You know they have toe tags, right?
You could just look.

17
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,154
Who you looking for?

18
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:06,317
It's not a who.
I'm checking for freshness.

19
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,452
- What part of dead is fresh?
- You wouldn't understand, boy.

20
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,327
I've been workin' here since you
boys still crappin' in your Underoos.

21
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,389
And I'm gonna tell you something.

22
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,492
There's a lot more to death
than what meet the eye.

23
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,299
I was supposed to run this place.

24
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,363
Yeah. Bummer.

25
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,739
I wonder why that promotion
didn't go through.

26
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,937
Because of what I know.

27
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,674
Because of what they
don't wanna hear about.

28
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,051
- All right, Franklin-
- Yeah, we're gonna get out of here-

29
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,984
Wait. Sit down!

30
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:41,093
I don't expect y'all to have the ambition nor
the skills to understand where I'm coming from.

31
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,961
But I'm gonna tell you something:
my philosophy on life.

32
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,056
Listen up.
It's very important.

33
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,931
Let's see if you can keep up.
Death-

34
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,430
What is it good for?

35
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,569
Absolutely nothing.

36
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:13,153
Crazy. Retard.

37
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,888
Hello, Franklin.
How are you?

38
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,362
Manley, Davis, you slugs.

39
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,797
Why can't you be more like Franklin?

40
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:25,733
<i>Some primates spend years</i>
<i>chasing after the opposite sex.</i>

41
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,796
<i>Take the African bonobo.</i>
<i>Please.</i>

42
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,842
Don't do it, brother.

43
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,399
It's not worth it.

44
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,775
Learning anything?

45
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,837
Nothing I don't already know.

46
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,850
- Where's my brother?
- Doing his toilette.

47
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,317
Really?

48
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,910
You been working out, D?

49
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,478
Your arms are huge.

50
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,421
You know, I do what I can.

51
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,118
It's looking good.

52
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,718
- Hey.
- Hey.

53
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,765
What the hell you doing here?
You got fired from the Big & Tall?

54
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,824
Actually, I got promoted
to assistant manager, thank you.

55
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:01,137
- We can get a discount on shit?
- Yeah. If you were big or tall.

56
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,641
Just pick out your clothes, sweetie.

57
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,008
I worked all night,
if you must know.

58
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,071
Send down some of your homeboys.
I might be able to hook 'em up.

59
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,977
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

60
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,449
You should come down to the court.
I'll spread the word for you.

61
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,353
- For real?
- Uh-huh.

62
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,789
Wait a minute.

63
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,226
Don't tell me y'all entering
that streetball tournament again.

64
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,457
Yeah. It's gonna
be different this year.

65
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,323
You said that last year.

66
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,926
- And the year before.
- And the year before that.

67
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,599
- So what you saying?
- I'm just saying.

68
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,103
Damn.

69
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,978
Twenty-five thousand dollars, man?

70
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,981
We got to win this.
Just got to practice.

71
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,210
Motown, don't you think
for a three-on-three tournament...

72
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,946
there should be more
than just the two of us?

73
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,853
- Yeah. I got it covered.
- I heard that before, man.

74
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,516
Seriously, I got it covered this time.
For real. We gonna win this year.

75
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,959
I feel it.
Besides, I had a dream.

76
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,094
Egads! Whatever are you doing?

77
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,829
I told you to wax her,
not scrape her.

78
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,598
Here. Diapers.

79
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,663
Never rags. Continue.

80
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,607
Motown's Car Service.
It's all about class.

81
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,841
May I share with you my dream?

82
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,247
Ladies, ladies, ladies,
ladies, ladies!

83
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,589
Y'all lookin' so lovely.

84
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,330
Hey, you. Driver.

85
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,100
Eyes ahead, my man.

86
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,102
Now, where were we?

87
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,688
Hey!

88
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,748
Let me guess.
The tittie dream, right?

89
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:00,918
Yes.

90
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,484
No. It's unrealistic.

91
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,895
Man, them titties
was very realistic.

92
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:09,196
- Fake, but very real.
- Hey, there he go.

93
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,702
- George?
- George is our third.

94
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,762
- Trust me.
- Hey.

95
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,205
- Hey.
- What's up?

96
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,434
Nothing.

97
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,837
What's up, George?
It's hot out here, huh?

98
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,903
Why your yellow ass
speaking to me, man?

99
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,972
Why you got to be so hostile, man?

100
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,042
I'm just tryin' to talk
a little basketball business, that's all.

101
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,714
- What you want, man?
- It ain't what I want.

102
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,120
It's what I got.

103
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,283
Check it out.

104
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:40,356
I wanna ask you about that discount.
I wanna get six more of these.

105
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,061
I don't mean to break up the party,
but we got to do this now.

106
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,195
- What?
- I'm gonna do you later.

107
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,463
Yes!

108
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:11,019
Well, if it isn't
last year's last place.

109
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,088
Yeah. That was last year.

110
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,758
And the year before that.

111
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,496
I can't even spell "lose." You?

112
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,061
L-O-hell, no.

113
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,142
George.
You? Them?

114
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,536
Then show me what y'all got.

115
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,604
I ain't had a good laugh all day.

116
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,380
- Check it up. Right here.
- Y'all ready?

117
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,551
- Go, go, go!
- Pick it up!

118
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,153
Yeah! That was sick!

119
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,563
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Call the doctor, baby.

120
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,295
- Y'all got 'em? Y'all ready?
- Come on.

121
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,702
- Big man! I got it!
- Yeah!

122
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,003
- Pay attention, man. Damn.
- Don't worry. I'm ready.

123
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,202
Check the ball, baby.

124
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,145
Who's that?

125
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,949
She works at the club.

126
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,585
She way out
of your league, okay? Check up.

127
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,152
Hey! Hey! Hey!
He holdin'.

128
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,764
You're killing me.

129
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,276
- You're killing me. It's some bullshit.
- He holdin'!

130
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,781
It's some bullshit. I'm not fin to look
like a chump playing with y'all. I quit.

131
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:40,217
You can't quit, man. What about Sabrina,
right? You want Sabrina, right?

132
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,084
Y'all here playin' like Scooby
and Scrappy-fuckin'-doo.

133
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,716
You want Sabrina
to hook you up. What?

134
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,257
That's the best move
that fool had all day.

135
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:56,062
- What you do that for?
- I'm nobody's prize, Motown.

136
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,103
- Are you crazy?
- A little bit.

137
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,199
- What were you thinking?
- We needed a third.

138
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:10,110
As for you,
buy yourself a quesadilla, sucker.

139
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,912
Damn! Pimpin' your own sister.

140
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:17,319
Give me that two dollars.
You don't get nothing. Punk ass.

141
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:35,301
How you doing, bruh? Good?
You look good. You look good.

142
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,972
Not that you look good
like I like you like that.

143
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:42,276
You look good like-
as a strong black man.

144
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,249
If you just let us in,
we'll barely be in anybody's way.

145
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,412
You got us let us in.
Have you ever wanted somethin' so bad?

146
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,615
We have to get in this club.
Just for a little while. Please.

147
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,251
We just need to get in
just for a little bit. Please.

148
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,023
Just move the rope
and let us in.

149
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,927
All right?

150
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,333
Okay, step the fuck back. Now.

151
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,838
Do it.

152
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,101
Hello, ladies.

153
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,700
That's what I'm talking about.

154
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,745
Very good. Very good.

155
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,849
- Back! Are you fucking with me?
- Not even a little bit.

156
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,647
Get the fuck back.

157
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,013
All right, plan "B."

158
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,457
I know a busboy named Miguel.

159
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,994
He told me he'll get us in at 10:00
for 20 bucks.

160
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,859
- Okay.
- You bet.

161
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,569
- You comfortable?
- Actually-

162
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,237
Hey!

163
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,572
- Hey.
- Hi.

164
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,669
Didn't I see you
at the courts today?

165
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,737
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

166
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,578
- Playin' a little basketball.
- Yeah.

167
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,484
- It was you.
- My name is Morris. Morris Davis.

168
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:58,580
- My friends call me Motown.
- I'm Tammy Dexter. My friends call me Tammy.

169
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,320
- Nice to meet you, Tammy.
- Hi.

170
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,661
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

171
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,824
So I haven't seen you
around here before.

172
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,495
- I just moved down here from Oakland.
- Oakland. Oaktown!

173
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,663
My cousin had a spot
in Echo Park, so I'm here.

174
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,572
- I like Echo Park too.
- It's cool.

175
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,004
Wait. Why are you in the alley?

176
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,837
Dropped my keys.

177
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,577
In a previous alley visit.

178
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,777
Uh-huh.

179
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,218
- Yep.
- Right.

180
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,922
- Oh, my gosh! What's that?
- Rat.

181
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:36,189
- A rat that big?
- Yes. L.A. The rats are huge out here.

182
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,231
Rat! Be quiet, rat!
Stop! Stop it! Be quiet!

183
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,425
Please, rat!
Stay quiet, rat!

184
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,525
Down! Rat, calm down!

185
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,229
Rat, down!

186
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,271
- It's cool now.
- It's cool?

187
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,396
- Yeah.
- Okay.

188
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,907
Do you wanna come in?
'Cause I can get you in the back way.

189
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,773
- No. I would never-The back way?
- Save you some money.

190
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,541
I'm cool, really.
I got it covered pretty much.

191
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,378
I'm gonna go back inside.
I just came out for some air.

192
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,042
That's cool.

193
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,642
- Hope you find your keys.
- Huh?

194
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,417
- Your keys.
- Oh, yeah. The keys. Stupid keys.

195
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,788
I'll try my best.

196
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,924
Wait. Tammy.

197
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,293
Hey. Why don't you call me sometime.

198
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:15,162
Yeah? Yeah.
I'll call you.

199
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,997
Okay.

200
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,502
I got to get back to work.

201
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,363
- Okay.
- Okay.

202
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,846
I'm gonna call her.

203
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,643
Yes!

204
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,513
What the fuck?

205
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,452
How are we supposed to get in now?

206
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,251
It don't matter.
Did you hear her? She said call me.

207
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,655
I heard.

208
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,989
What I didn't hear
is you getting her digits.

209
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,962
Damn! Why you ain't say nothing?

210
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,796
- I was too busy being a rat.
- Shut up.

211
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,774
Is that a roll?

212
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,346
Ask me if I want a roll, man.

213
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,789
- You hear that?
- It is kind of dark.

214
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,231
I don't like graveyard shift.

215
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,634
Yeah. Me neither.
Come on.

216
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,602
Hey, Motown.

217
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,369
Wake up.

218
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,909
Hey.

219
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,740
Motown.

220
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,440
What the fuck?
Where the hell we at?

221
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,510
Looks like the creepy and scary
morgue basement.

222
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,013
Let's check.

223
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,126
Franklin's crib.

224
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,597
Shit.

225
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:32,330
Dear Lord, don't take us now
while we're both in our prime.

226
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,330
At least one of us.

227
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,898
Man, I seen this happen
in too many scary movies.

228
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,638
I know. I know.

229
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:45,082
He's gonna tie your hands to the table and
your ankles to the Gremlin and drive away.

230
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,347
Or it's a little girl with long,
skanky hair over her face...

231
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,719
is gonna crawl out the TV
and bite your dick off.

232
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,420
Or there's gonna be a saw on the floor and
you're gonna have to cut through your own feet.

233
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,690
Why is all this happening to me?

234
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:03,599
'Cause while he's distracted with you,
I'm gettin' my black ass the fuck out of here.

235
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,638
You a selfish- I should've kicked
your ass off my couch-

236
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,570
I can hear every word
you fools are sayin'.

237
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,241
Get up.
Got work to do.

238
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,304
Franklin, people
know we down here, man.

239
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,818
Ain't nobody lookin' for you or you.

240
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,786
- What you doing to my Gremlin?
- Power source.

241
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,289
Couldn't get enough juice
from the panel.

242
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,325
I would've asked you, but-

243
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:32,456
Thought about the fact that I only consider
you a mere high-functioning retard.

244
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,868
Decided not to waste my time.

245
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,166
Today's y'all's lucky day.

246
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,896
Get up!

247
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,547
Y'all about to witness
a fuckin' miracle.

248
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,009
Look at him.

249
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,486
No friends.

250
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,216
No family.

251
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:03,661
Just tossed to the side
like yesterday's trash.

252
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,697
- Hold this.
- No, no, no.

253
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,756
Hold this, bitch!

254
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,563
What the fuck?

255
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:22,013
You, get over by the big man.

256
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,709
And you, go get them cables.

257
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:44,501
Franklin, this guy was dead
when you found him, right?

258
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,561
Technically.

259
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:50,267
But then I switched out
his busted heart for a brand-new one.

260
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,866
Franklin, man, that's crazy.

261
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,435
You can't give somebody
a heart transplant after they're dead.

262
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,606
Sure you can.
But that's not the hard part.

263
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,876
The heart.

264
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,114
Brain.

265
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,053
You sync 'em up.

266
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,716
Technically...

267
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,027
you got life.

268
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,687
You done this before.

269
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,595
Somewhat.

270
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,896
I almost had it last year...

271
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:20,200
and the year before that
and the year before that.

272
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,669
This year's gonna be
a little bit different.

273
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,741
Y'all ready to make history?

274
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,145
I'm ready to make number two
if you must know.

275
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,614
Y'all gonna be my witnesses.

276
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,448
Put them cables together.

277
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,894
Franklin, all right, let's just talk about this.
If I put-

278
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,090
Put them cables together!

279
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:55,672
Now, all you got to do, my friend,
is just breathe.

280
00:17:56,475 --> 00:18:00,809
That's all you got to do.
Now it's time for the moment of truth.

281
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,136
Goddamn.

282
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,869
Man, he's lucky to be alive.

283
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,039
- Him? What about me?
- What about you?

284
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,107
If Franklin didn't black out,
he would've killed me.

285
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,477
Stop. Stop. Stop.

286
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,549
You, come here.
You.

287
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,650
I don't know. He want something.

288
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,025
- I want something too.
- You-

289
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,986
- So what did Franklin want?
- Nothing.

290
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:20,750
Nothing? Every time you say "nothing,"
it's about somethin'.

291
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,987
Girls. Money.

292
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,188
Weed.

293
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,925
I know that face.

294
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,194
It's weed.

295
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,758
Let's go.

296
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,569
Man, that graveyard shift's a bitch.

297
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,409
And I hope no one's beat us
to Franklin's weed.

298
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,472
Like who?

299
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,780
Let's just get it
and get the hell out of here.

300
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,843
He said it was behind the TV.

301
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,515
TV? I don't see any TV, man.

302
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,287
All I see is hands in jars
and some old Kool-Aid containers.

303
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,850
I don't see no damn TV.

304
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,726
I think he was fuckin' with us.

305
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,326
Damn.

306
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,069
What the hell are
you doing in the drawers?

307
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:16,137
I thought he may have
one of those little bitty TVs.

308
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,910
Oh, snap!

309
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:24,478
Look. It's like some kind of old-school
computer zapper.

310
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,766
Shazam.

311
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,771
Ain't that a bitch.

312
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,893
- This is crazy.
- Look at this. Damn.

313
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,765
- This is way cool.
- Is that the TV?

314
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,429
Man, that's a nice TV.

315
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,139
And it just got nicer.

316
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,950
Now, that's
some high definition.

317
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,709
We have no choice
but to take care of Franklin's shit.

318
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,483
- 'Cause he did say take care of his shit.
- No choice.

319
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,547
- He did ask very polite.
- Very polite.

320
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,150
It'd be rude to make all this nice,
beautiful crib go to waste.

321
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,823
- Why go to waste?
- And I and you are in no condition to drive.

322
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,195
I'm fine.

323
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,625
Not in five minutes you won't be.

324
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,707
- Wait. Where you going?
- None of your business.

325
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,440
This is sharp, boy.

326
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,326
So what's up with Franklin, Jr?

327
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:19,127
Just leave him alone.
Shit, he ain't bothering nobody.

328
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,466
Damn.

329
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,030
Yeah, but what
if he gets all moldy and shit?

330
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,403
He already smells like a booty.

331
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,143
You think that's gonna help?
What the hell is that supposed to do?

332
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,277
You kiddin'?

333
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:39,017
I could go five days with just one sprinkle.
It's the Garden Fresh scent.

334
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,095
Hey.

335
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,996
Look like Franklin had a little bit more
going on than we thought.

336
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,057
Good idea.

337
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,559
Beer me, pimp.

338
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,599
- To Franklin.
- Yeah.

339
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:13,018
I think we should be called
the Super Hoopers.

340
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,083
You like that? Like-
Super-

341
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,153
Yeah. The Super Hoopers.
That's cool.

342
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,859
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I got some names too.

343
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,958
Oh, yeah? You believe, huh?

344
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,026
I believe, man.

345
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:29,096
<i>No foul. Game on.</i>
<i>Let's go. Come on.</i>

346
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,967
Man, that's just nasty.

347
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,912
- What?
- You just ripped one off.

348
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,577
Nah. No way, man.

349
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,950
Mine's have more of a nutty aroma.

350
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,781
Yeah, your farts
do be kind of nutty.

351
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,325
Yes, they are.

352
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:53,287
It's funny 'cause
you don't even eat nuts and shit.

353
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,162
Yeah, well, natural.

354
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,900
Come on, man.

355
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,909
I just felt the vibrations from that.

356
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,045
Nope. Once again, not me.

357
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,880
Maybe Franklin boy's
gone skanky after all.

358
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,814
Man, he not even there.
Stop blamin' shit on the dead.

359
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,084
- Where you move him to?
- Me?

360
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,217
What do I look like,
a monster magician?

361
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,890
I've been on the damn couch
the whole time.

362
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,454
I ain't move him nowhere.

363
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,899
If you ain't move him and I ain't
move him, where the hell he go?

364
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,164
You're so damn smart.

365
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,530
Unless-

366
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,933
Unless-

367
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,876
Unless-

368
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,379
Oh, shit.

369
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,921
- Oh, Motown.
- What?

370
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,707
Shit. We got to save the Gremlin.

371
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,770
We? That's not my Gremlin
about to get fucked up.

372
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,336
Give me that chicken.

373
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,076
Hey, give me back my delicious, crispy,
golden popcorn chicken.

374
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,981
Not unless you agree to help me save
the Gremlin.

375
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,043
All the rides I gave your ass.

376
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,340
Here's the plan.

377
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,007
We get in there.

378
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,109
We leave a trail of popcorn chicken,
leading away from the car.

379
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:31,155
We get in the Gremlin
and drive out and lock his ass in there.

380
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,527
Let's go.

381
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,447
Oh, shit!

382
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,484
Big as hell.

383
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:29,505
Come on, come on,
come on, come on! Faster!

384
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:39,382
Now, go.
Go, go, go, go.

385
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,671
Damn! What I tell you?
What I tell you?

386
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,003
<i>Listen to Motown</i>

387
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,101
Just what I told you. See?

388
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,081
- Hey, man.
- Yeah?

389
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,142
- There's a big ol' gate around the corner.
- I know.

390
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,416
I'm gonna pull out. You gonna get out,
and you go open the gate.

391
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,083
Why I got to open the gate?

392
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,356
What? Because you
gonna open the gate.

393
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,195
Next time we trapped in a garage
with a damn near seven-foot dead guy...

394
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,257
and we're in your car,
you can drive.

395
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:27,065
But until then,
you the gate-opener motherfucker.

396
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,628
Go ahead.

397
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,065
Be careful.

398
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,240
Thought that's where you put it.

399
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,419
- How's that gonna help us?
- It won't.

400
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:47,151
But at least now it won't go to waste
before we die in a monster stampede.

401
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,783
What?

402
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,092
Let's just say I get out this car
to open that gate, and I don't make it...

403
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,155
are you gonna be able
to live with yourself...

404
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,633
knowing you didn't get
to split this weed with me?

405
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,968
- Yeah, man, I could live with myself, seriously.
- Yeah, me too.

406
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,806
Right after this, you gonna open
that damn gate though.

407
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,583
It's like that?

408
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:18,554
See, I love how we
be thinking alike too.

409
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:20,887
Yeah, man.
That's why we get along.

410
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,927
Franklin crazy, man.

411
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,791
Yeah, I admire his work.

412
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,696
His work. That big
motherfucker's his work.

413
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,470
He dead.
He dead and shit, running around.

414
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,039
- He talkin' about he's gonna kill us and shit.
- He gonna kill us.

415
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:49,009
She thought where the air bag at.

416
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,917
I was like, "Man, you crazy, girl."

417
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,652
This a Gremlin.

418
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,656
We better duck.

419
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,563
You better duck.

420
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,038
Bring your seat belt from home.

421
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:12,372
It'd be, "You better tie your
regular belt around that seat."

422
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,718
Objects through the window
appear bigger than they are.

423
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,279
Yeah.

424
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,848
Jesus.

425
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,137
What you doing?

426
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,377
No, no. It's cool.

427
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:54,941
It's cool.

428
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,782
Good-bye. Get the fuck-

429
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,377
Oddjobz, my man.

430
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,923
Get back. Now.

431
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,687
- Kidding. Just fucking with you.
- I'm about to say. It's your boy.

432
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,162
How you doing over there on the bubbly?

433
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,664
We got a special going on, daddy.

434
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,963
- Yes?
- Yeah.

435
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:28,768
And since you one of my favorite
customers, these fell off the truck.

436
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,240
- Half price, cash.
- That's what I'm talking about.

437
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,937
- Yeah!
- Off the hook.

438
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,003
I knew you'd like that.

439
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,108
- What up, Celly?
- What up?

440
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,584
This is the list off all the cats who signed up
for the three-on-three basketball tournament.

441
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:45,816
Only one that's gonna
be a problem is George.

442
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,881
This fool wanna start his own team.

443
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,417
No. I don't want that.
He can be an extra on my team.

444
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,623
Except he wants his own team.

445
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,724
Is this what I pay to you do?
Make problems for me?

446
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,531
You supposed to fix problems.

447
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,539
I could bring the hurt to George.
I got no problem with that.

448
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,598
I could bring the hurt to George.

449
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,542
Whatever level of hurtness you wanna
bring to George, I can bring it to George.

450
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:10,479
You want low. You want medium.
You want high. I'll just dial it up.

451
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,381
Listen. Let me explain
something to you right here.

452
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,782
Listen. Check it out.

453
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,843
- This is George, right?
- Okay.

454
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,514
So now, George has his own team.

455
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:22,320
Huey and Dewey here.

456
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,156
But here comes Leon.

457
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,491
Time to go.

458
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,760
No more team for George.

459
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,894
Guess he'll have to come play for
Marcellus and the Procession after all.

460
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,631
- You dig?
- I dig.

461
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,935
All right. That's simple.

462
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,905
Yeah.

463
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,612
What's up?

464
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,740
Hell, yeah.
Hell motherfucking yeah.

465
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:49,048
That's what I mean.
You got it, right? Real simple.

466
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,113
Here's the problem that kind of
got me kind of fucked up here.

467
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,250
You took out
two cherries, right?

468
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:58,193
I know
that the olive is George.

469
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,524
Right?

470
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:03,260
But these two cherries,
is that two girls on George's team?

471
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,996
- Nah.
- I-

472
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,765
That's what fucks me up.

473
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,364
When I see two cherries,
I'm thinking that's two chicks.

474
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,874
Two honeys.

475
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,241
I wanna eat these honeys.
You know what I mean?

476
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,303
Like that.
Honeys out of there.

477
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,713
Honeys, to me, represent cherries.
You feel me?

478
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,558
See? We been babysittin'
Franklin, Jr. here.

479
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,618
We ain't even had time
to look for a third for the tournament.

480
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,755
Man, maybe we sit it out this year.

481
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,230
What? Are you crazy?

482
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,598
After the way
Marcellus disrespected us?

483
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,797
We just need somebody, man,
somebody big.

484
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,135
And wide.

485
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,732
- And tall.
- And strong.

486
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,040
What?

487
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,949
Oh, I got you.

488
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:59,319
You don't wanna say
in front of Frankie, Jr.

489
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,489
So who's gonna be our third, man?

490
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,825
- Frankie!
- Damn.

491
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,364
Ain't got to be yellin', man.

492
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,160
Yeah. Frankie. Look at him.

493
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,895
Frankie, stand up.
Frankie, stand up.

494
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,665
Stand up.
Look at that.

495
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,297
See? He's big.

496
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,865
He's wide. He's tall.

497
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:22,008
- He's black.
- He's black!

498
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,004
We win!

499
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:07,113
He just need practice.

500
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,050
A lot of practice.

501
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,495
Okay. Everybody good?

502
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,056
Yeah. Definitely.

503
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:20,297
- Delicious.
- So where did you say you're from, Frankie?

504
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,902
Frankie's from out of town.
Not from around here.

505
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,170
Oh, so what?
He's from a foreign country?

506
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,303
- Yeah.
- Alabama.

507
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,850
Alabama. Okay.
Look what I made for you, Darius.

508
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,011
Peach Cobbler. Your favorite.

509
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,554
Nice.

510
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,283
I know you like that.

511
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,190
- Yes.
- I forgot a knife. I'll be back.

512
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,921
Thanks.

513
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,690
Alabama?

514
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,425
- Alabama, fool?
- They got some big motherfuckers in Alabama.

515
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,228
- I'm just trying to cover up.
- What's that?

516
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,292
- You ever been to Alabama?
- No.

517
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,203
- They got some big motherfuckers-
- Don't you say nothing else.

518
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,010
- Damn!
- I got the-

519
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:08,808
Frankie never had pie
out there in Alabama.

520
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:09,978
Wow. Okay.

521
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:13,387
I guess it's nice
he liked it so much.

522
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,823
I'll get a napkin.

523
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,690
It's okay. It's all right.

524
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,627
Frankie, you can't do that.

525
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,460
No. No. No eat all food.

526
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,457
What you doing?
Please don't talk no more.

527
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,730
I pay $50 a month.
I can say what I want.

528
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:30,001
The rent is $375. You think I'm joking?
Don't drink all that water.

529
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:33,669
Frankie, don't drink- Don't drink
all that water. No. Don't drink it.

530
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,679
- Would you put it down, please?
- What the hell?

531
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,580
Look what you did-
let him drink all the damn water.

532
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,584
Me?

533
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,044
Frankie, calm down.
What's wrong?

534
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:45,884
Shit. He got to go to the bathroom.

535
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:49,084
Come on, Frankie.
Just hold it. Hold it.

536
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,720
- No. No, this way, Frankie.
- Come with me, Frankie.

537
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,264
You're in the zone, baby.

538
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,856
Get in there!

539
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,058
Get him through!

540
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,235
- All right, unzip him.
- Man, I ain't unzipping him.

541
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,605
Yes, you are.
Think of a number between one and 10.

542
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,474
- Seven.
- You are so off. Unzip him.

543
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,680
Man, I wasn't expecting that.

544
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:20,315
Man, I hate to say it, but I think
we gonna have to show him how.

545
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:23,258
- Frankie, turn around this way.
- Aim for the hole now.

546
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,318
Put it in.

547
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,387
You can get it in there.

548
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,456
Do it just like me and Darius
did it, okay?

549
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,301
Quit swingin' that thing, man.

550
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,429
Feel good, don't it?

551
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:37,065
There you go, Frankie.
There you go.

552
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,136
Motown!

553
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,074
Hey, Brin.

554
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:51,610
I don't even wanna think about what
y'all were doing in there, okay?

555
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,317
All I can say is...

556
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,490
I hope it was drugs.

557
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,960
What we gonna do
about Frankie, man?

558
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:04,023
- Depends.
- On what?

559
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,831
No. Depends.
Diapers.

560
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:10,305
He gonna need
some extra, extra large, man.

561
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,841
Nah. He'll be all right.

562
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,399
Frankie a fast learner.

563
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:16,571
You right as always, Motown.

564
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,514
Except the man was dead
just two days ago...

565
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,450
and can't say I blame him for being
a little slow on the court neither.

566
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,957
I know you bring me back to life though,
my motor skills are right there.

567
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:29,288
It's like when I'm alive.
Like-

568
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,958
Uh-huh.
Hey, motor skills.

569
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,998
- Yeah. That's what I thought.
- You play too much.

570
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:36,828
You crazy.

571
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,251
Frankie.

572
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:06,228
Hey, Frankie.
I'm gonna turn this down.

573
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,664
Hi- Frankie, hi.
I cleaned your clothes.

574
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:12,429
Oh, my goodness.
You are really one big fella.

575
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,733
Yeah. It's a good thing
I like 'em skinny.

576
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:34,348
Well, if it isn't Got No Game
and Got No Brain.

577
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,189
- Real funny, Marcellus.
- Yeah. Real funny.

578
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,252
Which one of us is which?

579
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,855
How's the hunt
for the team going, fellas?

580
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:44,867
Wait. I forgot.
No one wants to play with you nobodies.

581
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:48,837
Wait, wait. We are somebodies,
and we do have a team.

582
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:51,534
Planning on kickin' some butt
in the tournament. Now.

583
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:55,340
Who you tryin' to con? You two suck.
No one wants to play with you.

584
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:57,607
Marcellus, you always
think you know some shit.

585
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,616
- But you don't know shit.
- You tell him, Motown.

586
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,583
Frankie.

587
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:11,025
Yo. Who the big dude?

588
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,393
I don't know who that is, man.
I've never seen that dude before.

589
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,830
That's a big-ass dude.
You cannot miss that big-ass dude.

590
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,992
Yes!

591
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,557
What an eyeful.

592
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,041
You sittin' back there
gettin' all worked up...

593
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:33,413
like you ain't never seen a tall, studly,
bald black man before.

594
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,475
What? I'm just sitting here.

595
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,111
I want you sittin' there.

596
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,711
Check the big guy out.

597
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,450
I don't like surprises.

598
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,253
Not a bit.

599
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,920
Luwanda loves surprises.

600
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,054
- You say something again?
- What?

601
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,065
- Did you say anything?
- I don't think so.

602
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,397
Why does your neck keep turning like that?
Something wrong with your neck?

603
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,629
- My neck is fine.
- You need a neck brace?

604
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,968
Hurry up. Get me out of here.

605
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,140
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yes?

606
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,178
Look at me when I'm
talking to you. Look.

607
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,237
- What I'm tryin' to tell you-
- I see you.

608
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:06,783
- You act like you ain't never seen a studly, tall-
- I'm sorry. What?

609
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,910
- Just drive, Leon!
- We about to roll out of here.

610
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,149
Man.

611
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,588
Just tryin' to get respect.

612
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,853
Hey, we out of here.

613
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,937
We out of here, punks.

614
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,806
What the hell?

615
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,640
This gear has checked out.

616
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,772
Everybody put their head down.
I can't see.

617
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:39,440
Put your head down.

618
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,148
- What the-
- Jesus Christ, man.

619
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,985
Put your head down.
Why you still eyeing this dude back there?

620
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:50,720
When I turn around to back the car out,
I see your back.

621
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:54,025
- I'm in the backseat.
- I know you're in the backseat.

622
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,464
When I put the car in reverse
and see what's behind me...

623
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,694
I see your head,
but your head is turned that way.

624
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,361
- What?
- Are you driving the car?

625
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:02,701
- Or am I driving the car?
- I'm in the backseat.

626
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,970
I know you're in the backseat.
I feel that part, but every time I turn around...

627
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:09,410
See, Frankie,
basketball is just like life.

628
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,914
You just got to aim for the top.

629
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:16,919
And coming from a man who works the night
shift at a morgue, you know it's sound advice.

630
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,080
- So what you saying?
- Nothing.

631
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:22,751
- Damn. Where was I?
- Aiming for the top, Phil Jackson.

632
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,124
Anyway, aim for the top.

633
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,992
Like this. Watch.

634
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,055
Like that.

635
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,328
See? Come on.

636
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:36,170
- What the hell was all that?
- It's pizzazz.

637
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,004
I'm tryin' to teach him how to play ball.
You doing-

638
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,534
What the hell is Frankie doing?

639
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:47,583
Look like he movin' to the beat.

640
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,710
Frankie, Jr.'s got some rhythm.

641
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,077
He does.

642
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:54,784
Hey, kid, turn that up.

643
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:00,862
Hey! Frankie, you like that?

644
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:03,024
Like the music?
Yeah?

645
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,591
Well, see, basketball
is just like music.

646
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,694
All right, it's a beat.
Got to bounce. See?

647
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,398
See the beat?
Follow the beat. Bounce.

648
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,236
Yeah! Like that.

649
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,208
Beat, beat, beat.

650
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,472
Yeah! See?

651
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,571
Now, you try.

652
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,775
Yeah? You go.

653
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,410
Come on. Yeah.

654
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:26,179
Yeah, pick it up, Frankie.

655
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:27,746
Okay, put it in.

656
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,984
Frank- Frank- No.

657
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,757
Frankie, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

658
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,959
- You have to put the ball in the hoop, Frankie.
- Yeah, Frankie.

659
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,025
You got to end up with the ball
going through the hoop.

660
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,162
- Yeah.
- Ball through hoop.

661
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,071
- Uh-huh.
- See? Ball through hoop.

662
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:45,403
- Yeah!
- Got it?

663
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,841
You try it.

664
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,344
- Like he did it.
- Shoot it.

665
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,904
No, Frankie.
You put it in hoop.

666
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,472
You want me?

667
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:56,041
Hey. All right.

668
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,111
Okay.

669
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,247
Come here. Come here.
No, no, no, no.

670
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:03,782
You have to put the ball
through the hoop, okay? You.

671
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:06,295
Now, get him down.
Darius down.

672
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:09,525
Good.
Thanks, Frankie.

673
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,435
You put the ball through the hoop.

674
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,441
You, ball through hoop.
Turn it up.

675
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,942
Crank it up. Crank it up.

676
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,171
To the beat. Yeah.

677
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,441
Through the hoop.

678
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:26,483
You try through the hoop.

679
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,519
Come on.
Hear the music. Hear the beat.

680
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:31,747
That's it. Come on.
That's it.

681
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:34,620
Come on.
Through the hoop.

682
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:37,319
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

683
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,225
Like that, Frankie.
Yeah, Frankie!

684
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:42,561
He's got it!
By George Jefferson, I think he's got it.

685
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,965
Wait till I tell Marcellus.

686
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,906
Good job, Frankie.

687
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:01,314
I thought I'd find
you two goofing off.

688
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,744
Wait a second.
Who's this?

689
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,257
Mr. Samuels, it's Frankie.

690
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:11,488
- You- Frankie. You remember Frankie.
- Yeah, yeah.

691
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,154
You look familiar.

692
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,962
Watch him work.
You can learn something from this one.

693
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,300
- Work, right?
- Okay, y'all ready?

694
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:23,862
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

695
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,865
There's one for you.

696
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:29,037
- Yeah.
- One for me.

697
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:31,080
Yep.

698
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:34,640
- And double zero for the big man.
- Man.

699
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:36,777
There you go, Frankie.

700
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:41,348
Darius, how'd you come up with this?

701
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,915
It's my lifestyle.

702
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,052
"Freeballerz"?

703
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:50,789
Come on.

704
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,961
<i>Wake up, wake up, wake up.</i>

705
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,405
<i>The three-on-three</i>
<i>street ball tournament is starting now.</i>

706
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:05,472
Come on, man.
Play ball.

707
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,540
You ready to do this?
Let's go!

708
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:08,778
Let's do it. Come on.

709
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,883
Break it up!
Break it up!

710
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,224
Give it a rest.
Come on.

711
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,662
- Go. Go.
- Don't be doggin' me, baby.

712
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:31,733
You gotta be kidding me, baby!

713
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:35,444
<i>The Procession win.</i>

714
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:38,606
<i>They'll be moving on,</i>
<i>marching toward another championship.</i>

715
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:42,083
<i>Next up on center court,</i>
<i>a surprising entry-Freeballerz.</i>

716
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,176
Hey.

717
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:49,681
Calm down, okay?

718
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,420
Pass it!

719
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:04,438
Yeah!

720
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,233
- Y'all go that way.
- Over here. Come here.

721
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:09,108
All right. Good work.

722
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,170
We just need
to try to go up a couple points.

723
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:13,876
You see me, man?
We was out there like-Wham!

724
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,280
Hit 'em like that.

725
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:21,722
- Frankie had a little something to do with it, right?
- Oh, yeah. Of course.

726
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,851
Definite teamwork.
Good job, F-dude.

727
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:25,690
Frankie.

728
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,136
Hit that.

729
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,611
That's right.
Put it in.

730
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:58,887
<i>Winner: Freeballerz, with a dominating</i>
<i>performance by their new big man, Frankie.</i>

731
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:01,522
- Did he say what I think he just said?
- Yes, he did!

732
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:03,759
Freeballerz win, baby!
We win!

733
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:07,065
Hands up! Yeah! Yeah!

734
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,934
Get the fuck out of here.

735
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,571
I'm a winner!
I'm a winner!

736
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:13,802
What's up?

737
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,277
I'm Darius. Darius Manley.
Today's winner.

738
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,076
- Hey. I'm Darius. You can call me "Dearius."
- Hi!

739
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,673
- Hi.
- Hello, girl. I'm Darius.

740
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:23,843
What you find me on the big man?

741
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,115
- Can't find nothin' on him.
- Then try harder, Leon.

742
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,713
I need to know.

743
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:28,883
- What's up?
- Yeah.

744
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:36,992
Frankie, no. Let me show you again.

745
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,194
Like that. Turn right here.
Wait. Now watch me.

746
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:42,204
- Put your head in first, so you're safe-
- Hey.

747
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:45,298
- Hey. Hey! Tammy!
- Hey yourself.

748
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,502
- Y'all looked really good out there.
- Yeah? Thank you.

749
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,010
- Good.
- Thank you.

750
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,877
Did you get in the club the other night?
'Cause I didn't see you.

751
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:55,315
Yeah, for a second. We went to V.I.P.
It was crowded. Probably didn't see me there.

752
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,444
- Right.
- Had to get out. Emergency call for my job.

753
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,751
And you forgot to call me. Yeah.

754
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:02,383
- About that- I was gonna call you-
- What's with your friend?

755
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:03,790
Frankie, Frankie.

756
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,556
This is Frankie,
new member on our team.

757
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,621
He's a little different,
a little special.

758
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:10,325
Hi. I'm Tammy.

759
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,302
Hi! This is how we say hi.

760
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,395
- Hi.
- You say hi to everybody, not just one person.

761
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,406
Can't be selfish with it.

762
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,408
- Okay.
- We gotta get out of here, actually.

763
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:21,535
- We got more people to say hi to.
- Okay.

764
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:23,579
- Just gettin' here.
- And I gotta go anyway.

765
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,842
- Okay. Good to see you.
- I'll see you later.

766
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,111
- Bye.
- Bye. Nice meeting you.

767
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,653
You too.
Come on, Frankie.

768
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,348
Frankie, you can't be sniffin' the girls.
You can't do that.

769
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,391
I didn't even get
her phone number yet.

770
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:37,984
Okay? No sniff Tammy.

771
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:40,291
No sniff Tammy. Okay?

772
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:43,298
- Tammy.
- Yes. You like that, huh?

773
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,300
Big damn pimp.
Get in there.

774
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,469
A little bit to the side.

775
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,802
I'll tell you.

776
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:56,312
If the tournament was to end tonight,
I'd be a happy man.

777
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:58,973
Not saying I don't
wanna win, 'cause I do.

778
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,017
That would be big, you know.

779
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:04,520
Us and Frankie beatin' Marcellus.

780
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,988
Just think about it.

781
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:12,518
So, how much of a cut
do you think we gotta give Frankie?

782
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:15,724
I mean, technically he is dead.

783
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,824
See there, man, you go
thinkin' bad thoughts.

784
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:21,234
I'm only thinking
good thoughts right now.

785
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:24,068
- About Tammy?
- Yeah.

786
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,200
About Tammy too.

787
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:28,870
Tammy.

788
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,539
When did he start talkin'?

789
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,049
When he met Tammy.

790
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:38,212
Man! We startin' early tonight.

791
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,347
- Oh, man.
- Too slow, Negro.

792
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:42,357
Damn!

793
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,693
- What's she doin'?
- Come on, baby.

794
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:50,733
Take it up a notch.

795
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,428
- You know what daddy likes.
<i>- Sig Alert on the 5 South.</i>

796
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,567
Hey. She gonna
hit herself in the face.

797
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,733
Okay. Three-second rule.
You know that.

798
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:01,276
They get bigger?

799
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,945
Looks good.

800
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,779
Man. Frankie?

801
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,346
You really are fucked up.

802
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,851
Nah. Something's wrong.

803
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,693
Yo, Frankie.

804
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,255
Frank.

805
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,895
Hey. Hey, Frank, man.

806
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,904
Frankie.

807
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:38,811
- See? He's okay.
- Yeah.

808
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:43,784
Yeah. Let him see that.

809
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:46,048
That'll wake him up.

810
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:49,057
Look up there, Frankie. Yeah.

811
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,292
Take a look at those.

812
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:52,851
Yeah.

813
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:08,007
Yes, sir.

814
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,841
Tammy.

815
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,847
No. No. No.

816
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,816
That's-Well, kind of.

817
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,920
Quit playing around!

818
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:40,036
<i>If you're waking up now, the Freeballerz</i>
<i>continue to be this year's big surprise.</i>

819
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,102
<i>- And I mean big surprise!</i>
- What's my name?

820
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,943
Get off my court.
I don't lose.

821
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:48,143
I thought you got rid of
George's number two.

822
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:50,186
I did. I guess
he got himself a new boy.

823
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,112
I can't believe that
motherfucker turned me down.

824
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:57,591
Doin' his thing though.

825
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:00,955
That's exactly
why we need some edge.

826
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,534
And I think I just seen it.

827
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:08,469
- Really good, Frankie. See how strong you are?
- Yeah.

828
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:11,302
Yeah. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

829
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:14,207
- Yeah.
- Man. I was looking like M.J.

830
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:16,006
Who? Michael Jarvis?

831
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,569
Just messing with you, man.

832
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,672
Hey, Motown.

833
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:22,343
Lookin' real nice out there.
I'm feelin' it.

834
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,878
Listen.
Just wanted to wish you luck.

835
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:27,582
Thanks.

836
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,353
Nah, man. Why you being all nice to us?
Come on, Marcellus.

837
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:32,691
If Marcellus wants to be nice,
he'll be nice, okay?

838
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,390
Even if that means being nice
to you two fools. All right?

839
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:36,955
Just take the niceness.

840
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,625
Did I say you had to be in this meeting?

841
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:40,829
I got your back!

842
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,706
The truth is, you guys
have been playing real good.

843
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:52,839
I thought the Cruisers would cut you off
at the knees, but you bounced back.

844
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:55,180
You got game.

845
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:57,116
Great. Great, great.

846
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,621
- What do you want, Marcellus?
- I don't want anything.

847
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,749
A bunch of us will be at the club tonight,
getting our grown man on.

848
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:05,556
- Why don't y'all come by and join us?
- Us?

849
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:08,062
No! The two local crackheads.

850
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,723
Of course you.

851
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:12,359
- And bring your big friend.
- I don't know.

852
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:15,529
Hey, what's the matter with you, Morris?
We're just trying to have some fun.

853
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:19,565
I'll see you there.

854
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:24,736
- Motown.
- Yeah.

855
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:26,748
You trust him?

856
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:28,181
Hell, no!

857
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:30,242
But we're going to the club, right?

858
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:33,880
What?

859
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:35,288
We're on the list.
That's what.

860
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:36,882
Motown Davis.

861
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,450
And Manley.

862
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:40,257
Darius Manley.

863
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,855
And this here's Frankie.
Right there.

864
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:44,456
Cool.

865
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:46,161
Y'all go right on in.

866
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:52,664
Fucking get back.

867
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:04,419
See, Frankie?

868
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:08,856
A place like this, man,
you gonna need some pointers.

869
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,860
I think what he's saying
is, Frankie, is-

870
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,954
may work on a werewolf bitch,
but it ain't gonna be enough in here.

871
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:17,056
Now, I have
some tried-and-true methods.

872
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:19,124
And what are those, Darius?

873
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:24,697
Well, when a girl asks me what I'm all about,
I tell her I'm an astronaut trainee.

874
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:27,334
Man, do you know
there's barely any black astronauts?

875
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,844
Exactly. That's why
I tell her I'm a trainee.

876
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:32,381
I tell her
why ain't no more black astronauts...

877
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,043
and how I'm staking out
new turf for the black man.

878
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,109
Yeah. Gets 'em every time.

879
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:41,749
I hate I'm even asking this in the club,
but why aren't there any black astronauts?

880
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:44,885
You think the government wants us up
there with all their white space women?

881
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:53,325
- Where's he goin'?
- He'll be fine.

882
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:55,564
I'm gettin' a drink.

883
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:16,358
Hey.
Didn't I see you play today?

884
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:20,055
Well, if you didn't,
I have it TiVo'd back in my crib.

885
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:23,530
- I'd like to see that.
- Hey, Darius.

886
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,331
- Sabrina, what you doing here?
- I just came to give you the good news.

887
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:30,497
I went to the doctor,
and you didn't give me herpes.

888
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:35,536
What you do that for?

889
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,102
Do what?

890
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,375
Go sit two stools down.

891
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,517
Hey. Excuse me.

892
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:49,080
Is Tammy Dexter working?
Tammy.

893
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:52,389
- Tammy.
- I don't know. I'll go see.

894
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:54,385
Hello.

895
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:55,795
Is this seat taken?

896
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,936
Good. So, why don't you
buy us a couple of drinks?

897
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:04,030
Okay. Drinks. All right?
We at the club. I could- Drinks. I could-

898
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:07,099
Waitress, could you come here for a-
Waitress. Hey.

899
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:10,612
I was wondering, could I get
a couple 40 ounces, please?

900
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:14,809
Make it a bottle of your best champagne.
Thanks.

901
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,482
Don't worry, baby.
You can handle it. Run a tab.

902
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,353
Sit.

903
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:22,584
Stay.

904
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,183
Good girl.

905
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,054
Again.

906
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,964
So, what do you do?

907
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:36,437
Work at the morgue.

908
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:40,267
No, really.
What do you do?

909
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:42,277
I'm an astronaut trainee.

910
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,070
I didn't think there were
a lot of black astronauts.

911
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:47,139
It's an interesting story.

912
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:02,658
Here we go.

913
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:10,766
Monster of a man like that shows up out
of nowhere and plays for those two losers?

914
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,774
I'm not buyin' it.

915
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:16,471
That's why I got a cop friend
down in Rampart gonna run this for me.

916
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,605
Handle that.

917
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,945
- You got a friend who's a cop?
- Yeah.

918
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,076
- You know a dude who's a cop?
- Yeah.

919
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,143
Wow, man.

920
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:27,849
L could have took care of this.

921
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:30,688
I could have ran it.
You know.

922
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:11,451
And that's why me and Sabrina
don't look alike.

923
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:14,724
If you see my sister, you'll know.
Not the same father.

924
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,958
So then-

925
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:20,730
So that's-That was the end of us
having to all take baths together.

926
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:26,332
They-
They wanted to listen. I could tell.

927
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,344
But they hadn't been trained really.
It's hard to walk pit bulls.

928
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,676
Like, the whole, you know-

929
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,808
I thought that I had a hit record.
It's funny.

930
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:38,150
You're so cute.

931
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:41,122
That's nice of you.
This is delicious. This drink.

932
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:44,091
- I told you it was gonna be delicious.
- It's great.

933
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,491
Good. I like it.

934
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:47,620
You are so cute. You know that?

935
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:49,631
Thank you.

936
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:52,190
I don't know.
Maybe if I had-

937
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:59,606
Oh, that thing
comes off pretty easy.

938
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,807
Be careful.

939
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:08,078
Yeah.

940
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,652
There's people in here.

941
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:14,212
You know that?

942
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:19,484
I've never seen a girl
like you before in my life.

943
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:21,757
- No?
- No.

944
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:25,432
Hey.

945
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,560
Hey, everybody, look at me.

946
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:30,929
What church you go to?

947
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:44,312
- Good.
- Yeah.

948
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,735
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

949
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,317
You doing it big
over here, Motown.

950
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,950
Hey. Marcellus and Leon.
What's up, y'all?

951
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:58,550
This is Vanessa.

952
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,220
- Say hi, Vanessa.
- How you doing?

953
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:02,856
- What's up, Vanessa?
- She would have said hi to y'all earlier, man.

954
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:05,765
- She is saying hi to a lot of people.
- Look. I can dig it.

955
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,996
- It's time to get her in the Jag.
- Oh, yeah.

956
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,436
Vanessa, they gonna
put you in the Jag.

957
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,872
You get the bottom.
You don't mind, right?

958
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:14,341
Top, bottom.

959
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,311
My dude,
you know how to party.

960
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,905
- You the man though.
- I gotta tell ya.

961
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:21,973
- Thank you. Okay.
- Let's do this. Got it?

962
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,519
- It was nice meeting you.
- Yeah. Whatever.

963
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,800
Hey. Hey, Tammy.

964
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:41,860
Hey. I was looking-
I looked for you.

965
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:44,303
You here.

966
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:46,307
You seem to be having a good time.

967
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,536
Yeah. You know. No.

968
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:52,777
Not really.
It's kind of boring in here.

969
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:55,214
Motown, I have eyes, okay?

970
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:56,876
God.

971
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,944
I just really thought
you were different.

972
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:01,350
I am.

973
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:03,051
No. Obviously not.

974
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,202
Wait.

975
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:17,330
Wait.

976
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:30,083
Mister, you are talking my language.

977
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:54,467
I think I just threw up a little
in my mouth.

978
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:57,603
Swallow it back down,
'cause we gotta practice, man.

979
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,945
- Hey. Who you motherfuckers think you are?
- What?

980
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,679
I don't know about him,
but I'm the motherfucker who need a mint.

981
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:07,621
You ran out on your tab last night,
and I had to cover.

982
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,557
- The tab was, like, 750,jackass.
- Nah.

983
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:13,652
- I didn't drink that much champagne.
- Yeah, you did.

984
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:15,720
Girl like Vanessa
got expensive taste.

985
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,130
What, you think she liked you
for your cute little smile?

986
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:22,900
- That's a lot of chips, Cellus.
- Goddamn right it is.

987
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:24,371
And I need 'em today.

988
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:32,779
All right.

989
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:34,611
Maybe I spoke too soon.

990
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:36,776
I'm a reasonable dude.
We friends, right?

991
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:38,945
Yeah, I guess.

992
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:41,285
So friends should always
work shit like this out.

993
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:45,054
Right. So, you spot us the dough,
and then when we get it, we give it to you.

994
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:46,389
We're good for it.

995
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:48,089
Y'all ain't good for shit.

996
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:49,893
But I'll tell you what though.

997
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:51,796
Big man-
I could use him for the tournament.

998
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:54,463
No deal.

999
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:00,973
Either big man plays for me,
or he don't play for anyone ever.

1000
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:02,977
You can't take this out on Frankie.

1001
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:06,481
I can take this out on whoever gonna
keep me from winning.

1002
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:09,143
I'm chasing a record,
and I won't be denied.

1003
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,919
And it's sad to say-

1004
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:16,446
but if I get rid of you two motherfuckers,
who'd notice?

1005
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:17,822
Yeah.

1006
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:23,021
Come on. Let's go talk-

1007
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,465
Excuse me. Excuse me, man.

1008
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:27,661
- Yeah.
- Let's go talk. Come here, Darius.

1009
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:30,364
- Come here, Frankie.
- Go and talk about it, Darius.

1010
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:33,364
Come here.

1011
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:41,975
Frankie, this might be
a good opportunity for you, man.

1012
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:43,382
You know?

1013
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,182
Play with Marcellus
and the Procession.

1014
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,956
They're a good team.

1015
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:55,725
I mean, we're losers,
and they're winners.

1016
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:58,460
- We winners too.
- No, Darius. We're not.

1017
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:01,833
You said it yourself, man.
I do this every year.

1018
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:03,701
Right?

1019
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:05,296
Frankie a winner.

1020
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:11,202
Probably wouldn't have
pulled it off anyway.

1021
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:15,548
Be good for you.
You know?

1022
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:18,314
Later for all this huddle-up shit.
Come on, big man.

1023
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:26,017
Take care of him, Marcellus.

1024
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,321
Damn.

1025
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:35,460
You realize we up
for the next round, right?

1026
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:36,766
Yeah.

1027
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,397
I know.

1028
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:40,408
We'll find somebody, man.

1029
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:43,036
With five minutes notice?
Who's that?

1030
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:46,710
Pass the ball.
Pass the fucking ball.

1031
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:49,580
- Go, go, go.
- Ankles.

1032
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:52,382
- Go, little man. Go.
- We got it. We got it.

1033
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:55,048
- I think he's fouling me.
- Shut up. It's cool.

1034
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:57,058
- Got your fucking glasses on, ref?
- Set it up.

1035
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:59,890
- Go down.
- Pass it again. I'm fucking open.

1036
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:02,430
All right. Come on.

1037
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,301
- Good money. Yeah.
- Yes!

1038
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,963
Freeballerz for life!
That's what I'm talking about!

1039
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:13,475
<i>Freeballerz down by 18</i>
<i>without their big man Frankie.</i>

1040
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:17,308
<i>I'm keeping my money in my pocket.</i>

1041
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:19,404
<i>No. Wait.</i>
<i>We've got 5-0 on the court.</i>

1042
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:23,078
<i>- Great defensive move by the police.</i>
- I'll kill him.

1043
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:25,279
Ain't gettin' him to panic, captain.

1044
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,546
It wasn't me.

1045
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:32,385
Pass the fucking ball already.
I'm wide open.

1046
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:34,088
Looks like it's a forfeit.

1047
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:35,755
- Freeballerz win.
- What? What?

1048
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:39,096
- Yeah! We made it!
<i>- Freeballerz moving on to the next round.</i>

1049
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:41,398
You 13, 14.
Let's do this shit, baby.

1050
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:44,098
That's some bullshit
y'all playing. Come on.

1051
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:46,334
Frankie, come on. Frankie. Go.

1052
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,507
Yeah! That's how, Frankie!

1053
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,671
Bring it to the hole.

1054
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,681
Yeah!

1055
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:56,309
I can't stand this game!
I hate this game!

1056
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:57,909
Take your ass home!

1057
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:02,252
That's what I'm talkin' about!

1058
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:04,588
<i>The Procession delivering a new lesson</i>
<i>with their center Frankie.</i>

1059
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:07,356
<i>No way these guys can be stopped.</i>

1060
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,829
<i>The Procession once again</i>
<i>confident in this tournament.</i>

1061
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:11,832
Frankie. Say, man.

1062
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,663
Nice defense out there.

1063
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:17,831
The Procession don't waste
their time with losers.

1064
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:19,373
You dig?

1065
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,272
- Let's go, Frankie.
- We're just saying hi, Marcellus.

1066
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,818
Yay, Frankie!

1067
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:35,550
Congratulations!

1068
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,558
Okay. So?

1069
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:40,117
How do you want to celebrate?

1070
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:42,755
You want to hang
with your friends, or...

1071
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:46,961
you want to come home
for a tumble in Luwanda's playpen?

1072
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:58,239
Bye-bye.

1073
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,542
What's my name, Frankie?

1074
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:07,244
Tammy.

1075
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,813
Close enough.

1076
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:19,857
What's my name?

1077
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:25,407
You are such a mystery.

1078
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:29,069
Such a big
and wonderful mystery.

1079
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,213
You miss
your friends, don't you?

1080
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:37,980
Marcellus is never gonna let you play
with those two again.

1081
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:39,543
He won't allow it.

1082
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:46,690
Hey. You see Frankie today, man?

1083
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,298
He ain't look like himself.

1084
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,834
Like something's wrong, you know.

1085
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:56,234
What's wrong is we don't have him.

1086
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:57,567
Nah.

1087
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,197
It's something else.

1088
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:01,435
Like he's tired, or worse.

1089
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:05,175
Maybe he's got "monster-nucleosis."

1090
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:09,841
I don't know, D.

1091
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:11,249
Something ain't right.

1092
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:17,254
<i>Raging Dr. Johnson to the E.R.</i>

1093
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:20,523
<i>Dr. Johnson to the E.R.</i>

1094
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:59,356
You got what I asked for?

1095
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:02,370
Your friend the cop ran big man's prints
off that beer bottle.

1096
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,169
Let's see what the-

1097
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:08,266
What the fuck is this, Leon?

1098
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:11,471
I wanted to know who the big guy is.
This is a death certificate.

1099
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:14,448
I know he doesn't look dead,
but he has the certificate.

1100
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:16,381
That's the crazy shit.

1101
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,386
This don't make sense.

1102
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,752
Or maybe it does make sense.

1103
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:24,657
Where better for them losers
to find a third than the county morgue?

1104
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:27,627
Yeah. Frankie's turned
unreliable, Leon.

1105
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:30,221
Make George our third.

1106
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:33,325
What if Motown and Darius
get big man working again?

1107
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:34,664
Can't let that happen.

1108
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:36,135
We take him out.

1109
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:37,536
Kill him?

1110
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:39,836
Can't kill what's already dead.

1111
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:46,341
Hey, hey, Frankie.
What's happening?

1112
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:49,840
Come on.

1113
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:53,946
Yeah. Come on, Frank. Come on, Frankie.
Come on. Here we go.

1114
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:55,512
One, two, three.

1115
01:14:59,094 --> 01:15:00,254
Darius.

1116
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:04,092
Right in the trash.
Right where he belongs.

1117
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:05,656
That's just nasty, man.

1118
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:07,224
Green slime, man.

1119
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:10,135
Come on, fellas.
He won't make it through the night.

1120
01:15:20,616 --> 01:15:22,208
Hello, little girl.

1121
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:24,115
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

1122
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:27,617
That's probably some good advice.

1123
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,123
Right now I can't
really remember much.

1124
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,558
I need some help.

1125
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:34,562
I'm pretty sure I can't help you.

1126
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:37,599
So kindly get the fuck off my lawn
and get your help somewhere else.

1127
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:41,228
Don't make me beat your ass.

1128
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:46,966
All I need is a little information.

1129
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:50,375
In that case,
there's your information.

1130
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:51,935
Satisfied?

1131
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:06,052
And I don't want to see that
pin-striped ass around here again.

1132
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:07,254
Listen, you-

1133
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:13,494
I hope tonight you have to eat soap.

1134
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,102
For dinner!

1135
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:19,436
Soap mixed with toe jam.

1136
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,499
Mouse droppings!

1137
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:25,803
And boogers too!

1138
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,619
Motown.

1139
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:35,248
Tammy, what are you-
I thought after the club, you didn't wanna-

1140
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:37,849
Look, Marcellus kicked
Frankie off his team, all right?

1141
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:39,860
- What?
- Yes. And now he's gone.

1142
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:41,395
Then we gotta find him.

1143
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:43,658
Tammy, the girl at the club-
I didn't like her.

1144
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:46,098
- Marcellus set me up.
- Hey. Hey.

1145
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:48,136
Let's just find your friend, okay?

1146
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:50,899
Let's go.

1147
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:52,133
Damn.

1148
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:57,611
Where could he be?

1149
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,138
He's like a big baby out here.

1150
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:02,877
He don't know anything.

1151
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:04,441
Shit.

1152
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:07,215
Take a look
at this poor sucker here.

1153
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:11,483
That's Franklin.
That's Franklin.

1154
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,289
- It's who?
- Franklin!

1155
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,294
Y'all gave him away?

1156
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:17,423
No.

1157
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:19,490
Well, kind of.

1158
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:21,859
Where's he at?

1159
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:26,640
He's in a very delicate
state right now.

1160
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:29,176
We gotta find him soon,
or he's gonna die.

1161
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,803
- Again.
- Wait. What's he mean?

1162
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:35,076
You should have seen him on the court.
He was doing fine, right?

1163
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,984
- For how long?
- Long enough to get us into the finals.

1164
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:42,080
Y'all worked him too hard, man.

1165
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,557
Maybe you put him together wrong.

1166
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:47,356
Somebody please
tell me what's going on.

1167
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:49,522
Frankie was originally dead.

1168
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:52,032
Not the heart. That was fresh.

1169
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,194
Yeah. That was fresh.
I can't believe he lasted this long...

1170
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:58,337
fuckin' with y'all.

1171
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:02,004
Frankie.

1172
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,614
Frankie. Frankie.

1173
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:10,249
- Frankie.
- Look at him, man!

1174
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:12,650
He's all fucked up now!

1175
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:19,723
- Frank.
- Frankie. Is he gonna make it?

1176
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:23,162
If I could get him to sync back up-

1177
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,495
Music. We need music.

1178
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:27,626
Darius, what are you doing?

1179
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,365
Frankie's in trouble,
and all you can do is think about your music?

1180
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:33,135
- I'm just sayin'.
- Sayin' what? Why?

1181
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:35,506
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1182
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:37,238
Stop doing what you're doing.

1183
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:39,439
You continue doing what you're doing.

1184
01:18:42,317 --> 01:18:44,979
Look. He's syncing up!

1185
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:53,457
Good morning.

1186
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:55,018
Mornin'.

1187
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:58,589
How is he?

1188
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:01,101
Pretty much the same.

1189
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:04,602
You sat with him all night?

1190
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:07,039
For a few hours.

1191
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:09,270
He's actually kind of cute.

1192
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:12,206
Really?

1193
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,510
But not as cute as you.

1194
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:18,980
So, does this mean you forgive me
for being such a dope?

1195
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:21,845
Should I?

1196
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:28,986
Frankie.

1197
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:30,964
Hey, Darius, Frankie.

1198
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:32,522
Hey, big fella.

1199
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,091
You okay?

1200
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:36,501
He's back.

1201
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:39,563
How is he?

1202
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:44,177
He's still not looking so good.

1203
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:46,237
Damn.

1204
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:49,249
And it's 10:15 a.m.
Shit. The finals.

1205
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:52,047
Man, the hell with the finals.
I'm not playing no ball and Frankie layin'-

1206
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:57,281
You wanna play, Frankie?

1207
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:19,202
Good luck.

1208
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:28,152
I'm gonna holler at that monitor, 'cause if
these two fuck-offs can't show up, it's a forfeit.

1209
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:30,157
- We the champs.
- That's what's up.

1210
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:32,386
Sounds like you're scared
to play us, Marcellus.

1211
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,898
- Put me down, you woolly mammoth.
- Frankie.

1212
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:43,267
- Put me down.
- Frankie.

1213
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,907
- Get him off me.
- Frankie.

1214
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:56,039
Let's play ball.

1215
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:58,585
You heard him.

1216
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,322
- Let's go!
- Play ball.

1217
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:09,420
<i>Final round.</i>

1218
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:13,228
<i>The defending champion Procession</i>
<i>against the upstart Freeballerz.</i>

1219
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:17,203
<i>They started out as a joke,</i>
<i>but nobody's laughing now.</i>

1220
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,932
Two. One, two. One, two.

1221
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:27,204
Get up, Darius!

1222
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:29,910
Get in there.
Get in there.

1223
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:52,639
Yeah!

1224
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:54,800
Come on, man.

1225
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:57,504
You're killing me, man.

1226
01:21:57,579 --> 01:22:00,173
- You got a boo-boo, big man?
- Check him out.

1227
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:02,182
- Let's go.
- He got it.

1228
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,184
- He can't make it?
- He got it.

1229
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:06,015
He's fine.

1230
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:15,229
Put it up, D.

1231
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:18,266
Let's go. Let's go.
Up top. Up top. Up top.

1232
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,767
Good follow-up. Good follow-up, D.
Good follow-up.

1233
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:22,962
<i>Freeballerz down by five.</i>
<i>They're wearing down.</i>

1234
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:24,528
They're garbage!

1235
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:27,336
<i>Wake up, Frankie.</i>
<i>Looking tired out there, big man.</i>

1236
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,843
We're doing all right.
We're doing all right.

1237
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:33,244
- Frankie, you cool?
- What's up with you, Frank?

1238
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:35,249
You good?

1239
01:22:35,317 --> 01:22:37,945
- All right, Frankie.
- Cool, man. Darius. Defense, all right?

1240
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:40,010
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1241
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:42,779
You all right?

1242
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:46,520
- Too good over there, but let's just go.
- Let's beat them.

1243
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:48,357
- All right, fellas. Let's go.
- Come on, Frankie.

1244
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:49,692
Let's go. Check it up.

1245
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:51,629
- You can do it, man.
- There you go.

1246
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,691
Let's go!
Come on, man. Play ball.

1247
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:55,963
- Y'all gotta play some D!
- Bullshit test.

1248
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:58,028
Let's go, baby.

1249
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,713
- Come on.
- Y'all killing me right here.

1250
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:13,583
Oh, big man!

1251
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:16,982
Let's go. Let's go.

1252
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:21,855
What do you think, daddy?

1253
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:54,518
Can't win the right way, huh?

1254
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:01,034
Frankie.

1255
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:03,894
Tammy.

1256
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:08,272
Yeah. It's Tammy.

1257
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:10,311
Tammy.

1258
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:14,074
They're here for you, big fella.
They're here for you.

1259
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,154
- Yeah.
- Get up.

1260
01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:46,045
Come on, Frankie.

1261
01:24:46,114 --> 01:24:48,105
Yes.

1262
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:49,241
Yes.

1263
01:24:56,691 --> 01:24:58,659
Frankie.

1264
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:02,386
<i>The heart of a champion.</i>

1265
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:07,026
<i>The big man is back on his feet</i>
<i>with the Freeballerz down by one.</i>

1266
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:09,502
Let's go, guys.
Play ball. Let's go.

1267
01:25:09,571 --> 01:25:11,766
Let's go.
It's Freeballerz's ball.

1268
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,671
- Game point!
- Come on. Game point.

1269
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:17,006
<i>Freeballerz's ball.</i>
<i>Just enough time for one shot.</i>

1270
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:56,981
Yeah!

1271
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:00,716
<i>The Freeballerz have won.</i>

1272
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:02,312
<i>They're the new champs.</i>

1273
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:03,823
Yeah!

1274
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:05,018
Damn.

1275
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,629
We won! We won!

1276
01:26:08,696 --> 01:26:10,687
We won! You hear that, girl?

1277
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:12,255
Yeah!

1278
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:21,372
- Yeah!
- Baby!

1279
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:23,000
Are you okay?

1280
01:26:23,077 --> 01:26:25,307
What's for breakfast?

1281
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:26,779
You all right.

1282
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:28,338
Give me a kiss.

1283
01:26:30,318 --> 01:26:31,876
That was nice.

1284
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:33,352
Come on.

1285
01:26:33,421 --> 01:26:34,820
You're so crazy.

1286
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:36,686
Get up.

1287
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:39,022
Now you're playing against
three somebodies.

1288
01:26:41,629 --> 01:26:42,721
- Yeah!
- Come on.

1289
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:44,264
Yeah! Yeah!

1290
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:10,790
- All right, partner.
- See y'all.

1291
01:27:10,858 --> 01:27:13,156
- Watch it with my sister, man.
- Bye.

1292
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:18,331
Well, it looks like
you got everything you wanted.

1293
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:19,889
Not everything.

1294
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,705
Tammy.

1295
01:27:27,775 --> 01:27:29,402
You are silly.

1296
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:33,941
Hey, man.
Get off my sister.

1297
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:37,611
You know what it means
now that we won the tournament, right?

1298
01:27:37,685 --> 01:27:40,176
Yeah. I can finally
move off your couch.

1299
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,553
Hey, man.
Don't let that $5,000 go to your head.

1300
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:44,114
Five thousand?

1301
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:46,319
Twenty-five divided by three gives me-

1302
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:47,691
Back rent.

1303
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:49,957
Anyway,
it means we gotta defend the title.

1304
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:52,158
Not if we don't get our third back.

1305
01:27:56,971 --> 01:28:00,270
Girl, now you're
talking my language.
