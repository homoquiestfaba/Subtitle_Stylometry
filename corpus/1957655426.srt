No. We were at a party

he doesn't have much
patience with kids.

878
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:22,685

on Elizabeth,
you know what I mean?

879
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,489
I figured she'd be
better off with her dad.

Are you positive
it was your ex-husband
who took her?

881
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:33,529
He had been threatening
to o it again.

882
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:36,465
This time he was clever.
Cut a hole in the glass,
came in through the window.

883

your ex-husband

He moved.

885
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,707
Kurt made me promise
not to report him.

886
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:46,676
Why?

887

ex-husband didn't even know
the kid's missing.

Yeah, we checked it out.
He doesn't have the baby.

the guy who took her daughter

900
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:41,263
may have taken your son, too.

Why haven't there been
any ransom calls?

903
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:48,471
Well, I think this is something
being done for the black market.

904
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,610
What you have to understand is
there's a market for babies.

905
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,546
I mean,
to legally adopt a child
could take years,

906
01:06:57,546 --> 01:07:00,516
with no guarantees
even then,
so there are brokers.

907
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:04,553
You think someone's trying
to sell our son?

908
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:07,623
It's big money.
Six-figure fees
are not uncommon.

909
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:12,028
Some wealthy people don't care,
they just wanna cut through
the red tape and get it done.

910
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,630

to pay there's always someone
willing to do what's needed.

Well, there's,
there's something
I've noticed here.

913
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:29,345
Lucy Becknell's daughter
was being abused
by her boyfriend, she says.

914
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:32,348
According to this,
the Northside kid was
also being abused.

915
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:35,184
Justin wasn't being abused.

916
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:38,687
No, but the kidnappers
probably thought he was.

917
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:42,224
Head injuries, burns,
emergency room visits.

918
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,627
The thing is,
people who abuse their children

919
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:47,696
generally don't wanna
draw attention
to themselves.

920
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:51,667
So they might not be
so quick to report
the child missing.

921
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:54,236
Like I told you,
the longer a child is missing,

922
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:56,405
the harder it is
to get them back.

923
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,374
I think that's what
the kidnappers are counting on.
