1
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,100
- She's been in the water a long time.
- Yeah.

2
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,900
She's only wearing one shoe.

3
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,900
You seen a lot of floaters in L.A.?

4
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,600
It's not a floater. She'd be more bloated.

5
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,700
I think I found something.

6
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,800
- What do you need?
- Body bag.

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,600
- You sure?
- Yes.

8
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,900
Drowned?

9
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,800
I don't know.

10
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,800
This end was tied
to a couple of cinder blocks.

11
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
I always keep my gear in the trunk.

12
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,000
You think maybe
you shouldn't have untied it?

13
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,900
- Well, it kind of slipped off the blocks.
- Was it tied or not?

14
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,000
I've polluted the crime scene,
haven't I, Jesse?

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,200
Doc, I think maybe the forensics on this one
might be a little over our heads.

16
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,000
Thank you.

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,600
You want to see if you can
find the other shoe?

18
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,000
- Okay.
- Good.

19
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,400
It's the kind of cheap rope you buy
at a hardware store.

20
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,300
Not designed for the job at hand.
The end's frayed.

21
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,100
- Means somebody cut it.
- So the body was dumped?

22
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,900
Unless she tied the weight around herself
and jumped in.

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,300
- Wanna make some overtime?
- Sure.

24
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,700
Walk the perimeter.

25
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,600
- Looking for anything special?
- A clue would be good.

26
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,400
- Such as?
- Anything that looks like a clue.

27
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,400
Anything that doesn't belong
or that's out of place.

28
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,800
Belonged to a girl or a murderer.

29
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,400
Or Lillian Gish, for that matter.

30
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,600
- And who's Lillian Gish?
- Never mind.

31
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,900
It's a big lake.

32
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,100
Take your time.
When in doubt, assume it's a clue.

33
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,200
When Officer D'Angelo arrived,

34
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,200
you were punching out your wife
in the parking lot.

35
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
I wasn't punching her out.

36
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,100
- How many times he hit you, ma'am?
- He didn't hit me.

37
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,900
I saw him hit her a couple of times
with the right fist.

38
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,500
Have you looked in the mirror, Mrs. Snyder?

39
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,300
Come on,
you never had a few drinks before?

40
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,800
You never had an argument with anybody?

41
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,600
This is the third time they've been in here,
and she won't file a complaint.

42
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,100
That's three times we know about.

43
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,100
How many times you suppose it happened
that we don't know?

44
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,700
I didn't hit her.

45
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,900
Molly, take Mrs. Snyder
to the Emergency Room.

46
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, no. I'm okay. I'll be fine.

47
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,300
- Have them examine her whole body.
- She ain't going!

48
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,400
Mrs. Snyder, I'm going to put your husband
in a holding cell till he's sober.

49
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,600
I ain't drunk.

50
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,100
And I ain't going in no holding cell
and she ain't going to no hospital.

51
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,200
What's your first name, Mr. Snyder?

52
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,800
- Jerry.
- Jerry.

53
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,000
I think we got you for assault, Jerry.

54
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,900
I didn't assault nobody.

55
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,100
We have the bruised and bloodied victim.

56
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We have the eyewitness testimony
of a police officer.

57
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,500
And I think we can find some bruising
on your knuckles.

58
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,000
- You can't arrest me. I don't got no lawyer.
- I'm not arresting you, Jerry.

59
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,100
I'm detaining you. Pending charges.

60
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,300
Come on, Viv. Let's walk here.

61
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,400
Jerry! Are you okay?

62
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Come on, let's get up.

63
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,200
Officer D'Angelo,
escort Mr. Snyder to the holding cell.

64
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,600
You'll see him in a few hours.

65
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,500
Need help with your homework?

66
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,200
Actually, Michelle is tutoring me.

67
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,800
She says no self-respecting mom would

68
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,000
let her daughter graduate high school
before she does.

69
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,700
You better hurry, Carole.

70
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,500
- She's still not interested in college, though.
- Well, I'll talk to her again.

71
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,200
- You never went to college.
- No.

72
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,100
- But Portia Roberts did.
- Who's Portia Roberts?

73
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,000
- My first girlfriend.
- What's that got to do with college?

74
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,300
Nothing. But I think about her a lot.

75
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,300
You think if you went to college

76
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,300
things would have
turned out different with her?

77
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,700
Probably not,
but I would have gotten an education.

78
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,700
From her or from school?

79
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,700
Both.

80
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,100
Got a hangover?

81
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,200
I'm gonna pull those doors
right off their hinges

82
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,500
- if you don't let me out of here.
- I'll take that as a yes.

83
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm supposed to let some small-town cop
blindside me?

84
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,000
- Why not?
- I don't take that kind of crap.

85
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,700
We all take crap
and we all like to pretend we don't.

86
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,400
What, you think I'm pretending?

87
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,100
Nobody likes to face up
to being a stupid drunk.

88
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,300
- You calling me stupid?
- I think you're stupid when you're drunk.

89
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,800
You wanted me, Skipper?

90
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
Mr. Snyder is leaving.
Could you process him out?

91
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,400
- If you hadn't tripped me up.
- But I did.

92
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,700
- And I might again.
- Cops aren't supposed to do that.

93
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,400
That's correct.

94
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,300
I would think the police department
would have made a more successful attempt

95
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,800
- to bring her to her rightful home.
- We found the owner.

96
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,500
We asked her where she lived,
but she refused to answer.

97
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,500
Oh, sweetheart. Oh, honey.

98
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,400
Officer Crane, would you please explain
the circumstances of the arrest.

99
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,300
The arrest?

100
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,300
She was roaming around the pike
with no license.

101
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,100
- No tags?
- No collar.

102
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,000
- How'd you get her in the car?
- Donut.

103
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,200
- And she spent the night at your house?
- She did.

104
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,500
If someone or something spends
the night here, so does one of our officers.

105
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,400
We only have four people.

106
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,900
- Please tell me your dog is neutered.
- No, ma'am.

107
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, my God.

108
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,300
- The dog was lonely.
- Ain't we all?

109
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,100
Not the way I hear it.

110
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,100
School ring.

111
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,700
I didn't want to handle it more than I had to
so I dropped it right in the bag.

112
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,300
- What about prints?
- Look at the surface. No chance.

113
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,100
Maybe the stone, though.

114
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,300
- I won't touch the stone.
- Initials "H.R." on the inside.

115
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,600
I found it right here.

116
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,800
- What are you looking for?
- Well, she probably weighed 100 pounds.

117
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,700
That's a lot of dead weight to carry,
unless you're in pretty good shape.

118
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,900
- So you figure he dragged her out?
- The rain will have washed everything out.

119
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,500
It was a big rain.

120
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,800
I found the other shoe!

121
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,600
That's good work, Doc.

122
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,200
Kids come in here to smoke dope.

123
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,100
Guy pulls in, it's dark,

124
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,700
probably already dead,
most likely in the trunk,

125
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,900
but he can't pick her up.
People see it in the movies all the time,

126
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,400
but it's too much dead weight
for most guys to handle,

127
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,000
so drags her out,
probably backwards down the hill.

128
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,600
It'll be slow-going.

129
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,100
But there is sort of a path.
Kids probably use it to go down to the lake.

130
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,100
- The leaves are brown.
- So it's been a while.

131
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,900
- You think it might be hers, Jesse?
- Doesn't do us any good to think it's not.

132
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,200
Probably wasn't too calm
when he was dragging her,

133
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,400
so when the chain
around her neck snagged,

134
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,800
he just tugged her loose and kept dragging.

135
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,100
He would have wanted her to sink,
so he would have weighted her.

136
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,600
Yeah, but not on shore.

137
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,500
He wouldn't want to weight her down
until she was deep enough to let her sink.

138
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,800
It would have made dragging her out
that much harder.

139
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,900
She only had on the one shoe
when we found her.

140
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,400
What if he tied one end of the rope
around her ankle,

141
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,600
the other around the weight.

142
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,500
And after it was in the water,
the body began to decompose,

143
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,300
become more buoyant

144
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,600
and, at the same time, less cohesive.

145
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,100
The rope dragged off,
taking the shoe with it,

146
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,200
- and up she came.
- So we're looking at a murder.

147
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,900
It's a working theory.

148
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,700
<i>What I don't understand is,</i>
<i>if you can choose not to drink sometimes,</i>

149
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,000
<i>why can't you choose not to drink</i>
<i>all the time?</i>

150
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,700
<i>You need help with this, Jesse.</i>

151
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,900
<i>Are you drinking right now?</i>

152
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,600
- Yes.
- <i>Alone?</i>

153
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,900
No, with you, Jenn.

154
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,000
<i>You don't have to start big.</i>

155
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,600
- And you know a guy.
- <i>Yes.</i>

156
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,700
- How do you know a guy?
- <i>My psychiatrist recommended him.</i>

157
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,100
- You've been talking about me in therapy?
- <i>Of course.</i>

158
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,200
Seeing a shrink is not something cops
and ballplayers are supposed to do.

159
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,000
<i>I can make you an appointment.</i>

160
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,200
If I go, I'll make the appointment.

161
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
Capt. Healey's in your office, Skipper.

162
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,900
I need you to check out

163
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,700
all the missing persons reports
for Paradise County.

164
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,600
- How do you know the girl came from here?
- I don't.

165
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,200
Skipper, isn't it illegal to domicile
dogs and humans next to each other?

166
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,400
- It is. D'Angelo...
- I know. The Skipper thing.

167
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,600
It's a habit.

168
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,000
The State Homicide Commander personally.

169
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,200
- I told you, I live in the neighborhood.
- Good excuse to come home early.

170
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Absolutely not. I called.
You were out to lunch.

171
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,400
I came home early.

172
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,600
She drowned.

173
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,900
We also found a lot of alcohol
and carisoprodol in her blood.

174
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,800
Muscle relaxant.

175
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,100
Found traces of skin
on the loop at the end of the rope

176
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,500
and abrasions on her ankle.

177
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,700
- DNA?
- If we had someone to match it to.

178
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,900
- Dental charts?
- If we had someone to match it to.

179
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,200
- Fingerprints?
- If she hadn't been in the water so long.

180
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,700
- How long?
- At least three weeks.

181
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,600
She probably didn't go swimming
with a rope tied around her ankle.

182
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,700
Kid was probably about 14.

183
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,000
- Pretty amateurish.
- What's that?

184
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,600
Killer didn't know his knots.

185
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,100
One end came loose, the other
would have done the same sooner or later.

186
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,000
Guy who drugged her had plenty of time
to think about this before he drowned her.

187
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,400
That's cold.

188
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,100
Anyway, I got a guy on all this.

189
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,600
- Only one?
- You know how it works.

190
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,900
Slowly.

191
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,800
She was pregnant.

192
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,900
Excuse me.

193
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,700
Dr. Summers? Jesse Stone.

194
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,400
Oh, Mr. Stone.

195
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,300
Please, sit down.

196
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,200
- You're with the Paradise Police?
- Yes.

197
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,000
- And it's something about a murder?
- Yes.

198
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,200
We found the body of a young woman
in a lake.

199
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,600
- Gosh, how awful.
- Especially for her.

200
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,300
- Do you have anyone who's missing?
- Not that I know of.

201
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Of course,
we're not back for another couple of weeks,

202
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,800
- so I'd have no way of knowing.
- Isn't that a little late?

203
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,900
We're college prep. We're on quarters.

204
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,500
Why do you think that the girl
was a student here?

205
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,100
I wonder if you could help me
find the owner of that ring.

206
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Well, from its size,
I'd say it belongs to a young man.

207
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,800
Most likely.

208
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,600
"H.R."

209
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,000
Would I be sending one of my students
to the electric chair if I answer?

210
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,900
Well, there is no death penalty
in Massachusetts.

211
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,300
And this may be more about identifying
the victim than the perpetrator.

212
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,800
H.R. is William Royce.
His nickname's Hooker.

213
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,300
Hooker Royce is our all-American.
He's honor roll.

214
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,100
Three sports. Captain in all of them.

215
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,500
All-state in baseball, scholarship to Duke.

216
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,000
- And he's handsome and self-effacing.
- How did you know?

217
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,400
Might be sort of circular.

218
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,800
Probably wouldn't be the town hero
if he were ugly.

219
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,500
- Well, that's cynical.
- I prefer observant.

220
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,100
And being observant
would make you cynical, wouldn't it?

221
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,200
- You seem observant.
- I try.

222
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,100
- But you don't seem cynical.
- Well, I'm in the hope business.

223
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,500
- So you think you might be saving them?
- I have to think so. Or hope so.

224
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,200
Otherwise, what have I done with my life?

225
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,800
Bastard's been hitting me for years.

226
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,900
Why do you stay?

227
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,600
I'm Catholic.
I'm not supposed to get divorced.

228
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,600
- Have you talked to your priest?
- No.

229
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,100
I don't want nobody to know.

230
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,600
- But you're talking with me.
- Well, you already know.

231
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,700
He didn't used to hit me.

232
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,100
Is it booze?

233
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,500
Yeah, he don't usually hit me
unless he's drinking.

234
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,300
I don't want a divorce.

235
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,900
I'm 47 years old
and I drunk too much for 20 years,

236
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,300
and I'm fat and stupid and I look like hell.

237
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,400
I got no kids. I got no money.

238
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,000
Got no education.

239
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,900
Last job I had was waitressing
at a pancake house.

240
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
A rock and a hard place.

241
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,300
You married, Chief Stone?

242
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,000
No.

243
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,400
- You ever been married?
- Yes.

244
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,700
Maybe

245
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,400
you could talk to him.

246
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,400
I could do that.

247
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,700
You and your husband
ever been in counseling?

248
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,600
- You mean a shrink?
- Yeah.

249
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,800
No. No, I'm not talking to nobody.

250
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
All shrinks are crazy anyhow.

251
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,800
- So you used to be a cop?
- Until I gave it up to be a drunk.

252
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,100
- What pushed your button?
- My boozer button?

253
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,800
- The precipitating event.
- Booze.

254
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,400
I was a drinker of opportunity.
I got my hands on it, I drank it.

255
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,300
I was all right till my wife left me.

256
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,600
No, you weren't.

257
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,300
Even when you were sober,
you were a drunk waiting to happen.

258
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,800
Just what did my wife tell you about me?

259
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,200
Ex-wife.

260
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,200
She says you have
a hyperactive sense of responsibility.

261
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,900
She says you feel
the divorce was your fault,

262
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,800
even though she was having the affair.

263
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,400
She thinks you also feel responsible
that your friend Abby Taylor was murdered.

264
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,600
I am responsible.

265
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,900
- You working on a murder case now?
- Yes.

266
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,900
That your fault, too?

267
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,800
I sense a parable.

268
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,300
My wife left me because I was a drunk.

269
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,800
- Booze kill the job, too?
- It did.

270
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,600
- So how'd you get sober?
- I stopped drinking.

271
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,600
You're a drunk because you drink.
You don't drink, you're not a drunk.

272
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,900
- You don't believe in addiction?
- Sure I do. I was addicted. I still am.

273
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
But that's just an explanation.

274
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,000
If you want to stop drinking, pal,
you got to do more than explain it.

275
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
You're a cold bastard, aren't you?

276
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,200
Getting sober is cold-bastard work.

277
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,500
- I need a drink.
- Me, too.

278
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,300
Trying to stay in shape?

279
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,400
It'd be dumb not to. Who are you?

280
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,900
I'm Chief Stone, Paradise Police.
This is Officer Simpson.

281
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,100
- What's going on?
- Found your class ring.

282
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,300
I didn't know it was lost.

283
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,500
How's that?

284
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,800
I gave it to somebody.
Why do you wanna know?

285
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,800
'Cause I'm the police chief.

286
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,900
- So I have to tell you?
- Sooner or later.

287
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,700
Who'd you give it to?

288
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,800
Billie Bishop.

289
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,300
You see, I'd broken up
with my regular girlfriend and...

290
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
And Billie was available?

291
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,500
Billie was always available.

292
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,700
- So how come the ring?
- I started to feel kind of sorry for her.

293
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,600
I mean, like, everybody was banging her,

294
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
but nobody cared much about her,
you know?

295
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,900
I do now.

296
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,300
Everyone thought she was stupid,
but she wasn't.

297
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,800
And you fell head over heels in love?

298
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,100
What planet are you from?
No, Paula and I, we patched it up.

299
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
I didn't care about the ring,

300
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,500
so when I broke it off with Billie,
just told her to keep it like a memento.

301
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
I mean, I can always get Paula
something from Duke.

302
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,300
It seems fair to Paula. How did Billie take it?

303
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,200
It was funny.
It was like she expected it to happen.

304
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
Like it was no big deal.

305
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,100
You think you could tell me
what this is all about?

306
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,200
Think you'll make the Duke baseball team?

307
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,000
Sure.

308
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,500
You gotta stay positive, right?

309
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,500
I hope it's not Billie.

310
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,000
Gotta be somebody.
What can you tell me about her?

311
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,100
Billie was the school pump.

312
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,500
- Don't beat around the bush.
- I know.

313
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
It's an awful thing to say, isn't it?

314
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,200
- We used to say it when we were kids.
- We all did.

315
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,700
It says everything and nothing.

316
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm more interested in everything.

317
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,100
Aside from a tendency towards frequent,
indiscriminate sex,

318
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,300
what kind of student was she?

319
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,500
Not a good one.

320
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,200
She failed a number of courses,

321
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,000
which, as you may know,
in today's educational climate, is not easy.

322
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,900
- But she wasn't stupid.
- No.

323
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,100
But extremely passive, apathetic.
Never spoke in class.

324
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Was she always that way?

325
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,100
I don't know.

326
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,500
- Val?
- <i>Yes?</i>

327
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,300
Could you get me Billie Bishop's records
from before she transferred.

328
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,300
<i>Sure.</i>

329
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,600
- When did she transfer?
- Two years ago.

330
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,200
Anything wrong with the parents?

331
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,500
Other than the fact
that their daughter was a mess?

332
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,000
They were upset about her grades.
Very status conscious.

333
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,200
Concerned about what other people think.
Thanks.

334
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,100
So how did the school hero end up
with the town pump?

335
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,400
There's that cynical thing again.

336
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,700
Well, it seems that Billie was an A student
before she came here.

337
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,400
Excellent teacher recommendations.

338
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,500
I just assumed
that I had inherited a problem student.

339
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,600
It's not exactly a ringing endorsement
of someone in the hope business.

340
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,800
So something changed and it changed here.

341
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,900
- Probably will make it.
- What?

342
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,700
The Duke baseball team. Hooker Royce.
Probably he'll make it.

343
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,500
You're two inches low
and one inch to the right.

344
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,200
I think the ring and the chain are connected.

345
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,100
Didn't the girls at your high school do that?

346
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,800
Wear the boyfriend's ring on a chain
around their neck?

347
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,500
I can't remember.

348
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,000
The thing that bothers me is,

349
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,900
wouldn't we have found the ring
near where the chain broke?

350
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,900
Not really. Could've caught in her clothing.

351
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,900
It's not like the killer
was leaving bread crumbs

352
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
so we could find the body.

353
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,200
Guess we got ourselves a suspect.

354
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,300
He didn't do it.

355
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,700
Where did that last one come from?

356
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,100
Try one more click to the left.

357
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,300
Well, he could have done it.

358
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,100
A guy who knows somebody's dead,
doesn't talk that way about them.

359
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,200
- So you don't want me to check him out?
- No. Go ahead, you've got to.

360
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,600
See if he'll give you a DNA sample.

361
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,700
That'll do.

362
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,900
- Mrs. Bishop?
- Yes.

363
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,900
I'm Chief Stone, Paradise Police.
This is Officer Simpson.

364
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,100
Ma'am.

365
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,100
- May we come in?
- Sure.

366
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,400
Hank, there are policemen here.

367
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,700
Please, come in.

368
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,400
What seems to be the problem?

369
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,900
I wonder if you could tell us
where your daughter is.

370
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,300
Emily is at college.

371
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,700
- What about Billie?
- Is this about the girl in the lake?

372
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,800
- Yes, ma'am, it is.
- Oh, my God.

373
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,300
- Is it Billie?
- We don't know that.

374
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,100
Oh, my God.

375
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,900
Our daughter's been gone some time.

376
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,700
There's no record
of a missing person report being filed.

377
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,300
- Why is that?
- Because he threw her out!

378
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,400
- Sandy.
- He didn't want people to know.

379
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,000
- He cares more about what people...
- That's enough!

380
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,500
I keep very high standards in this house,
and up until about a year ago,

381
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,500
our daughter had no trouble meeting them.

382
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,500
But then it was like she went off the rails,
grades in the toilet, drugs, sex.

383
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,400
Her friends kept spotting her in town,
so I assumed that she was all right.

384
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,300
- Obviously, that was...
- A mistake.

385
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,800
When's the last time anyone heard from her?

386
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,000
- About six weeks...
- Three weeks.

387
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
- I promised her I wouldn't tell.
- What did she say, Mrs. Bishop?

388
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,300
She said that she was happy.

389
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,900
She was... Said not to worry.
Things were better this way.

390
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,900
Did she say where she was?

391
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,300
No.

392
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,200
May I see Billie's room?

393
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,200
Do you think the girl in the lake is Billie?

394
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm afraid I think it could be.

395
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,400
The girl in the lake is Elinor Bishop.
Nickname: Billie.

396
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,200
- How do you know?
- I think I know.

397
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,700
I have no such person
on the statewide missing persons list.

398
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,700
Yeah. Well, the father was concerned
what other people would think.

399
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,100
<i>I'll try and get you some dental charts</i>
<i>so you can make a positive.</i>

400
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,200
That'll work.

401
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,000
See if you can speed it up.
The parents are really hurting.

402
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,300
- How pregnant?
- Couple of months.

403
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,300
- You think the fetal DNA will hold up?
- Sure, but DNA takes time.

404
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,800
It'll give us the father.

405
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,500
- If we had someone to match it to.
- Right.

406
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,400
I just saw Mrs. Snyder at Stop & Shop.

407
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,000
- She told me she's getting a divorce.
- She tell him?

408
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,400
- She's trying to build up the nerve.
- She say why?

409
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,900
Well, she didn't quite put it this way,

410
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,700
but it sounded like all those years
he was punching her around,

411
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,300
she used to think
that if he'd only stop they could be happy.

412
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,800
She finally realized that even
if he did stop, she still wouldn't like him.

413
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,900
Paradise Police Department.

414
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,600
Hold, please.

415
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,400
Dr. Summers for you.

416
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,700
I know you're off duty,
but could you get me another cup of coffee?

417
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,000
I think so.

418
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,800
Jesse Stone.

419
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,200
<i>I've been doing a little research.</i>

420
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,700
I had some things sent over
from Billie's previous school.

421
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,700
And I think they might be of interest.
I think we should have dinner.

422
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,600
- Your husband won't mind?
- There is no husband, Chief Stone.

423
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,500
- When?
- <i>Any time but Saturday.</i>

424
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,500
That's Norman Shaw's
annual fundraiser for the school.

425
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,600
- The writer?
- And benefactor.

426
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,500
- How about tonight?
- I'd love to.

427
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,000
<i>36 to 222.</i>

428
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,100
Come on, Bobby.

429
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,600
You know I can't go to lunch
until you get this car out of here.

430
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,800
Yeah.

431
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,000
- <i>Service line 2.</i>
- We need to talk.

432
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,800
I don't want to talk with you, pal.

433
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,800
- Why would you?
- Are you arresting me?

434
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,500
- Hell, no.
- Then I don't have to go.

435
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,400
Sure you do. Or we can talk about
domestic violence right here.

436
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,300
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

437
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,900
You hit your wife again and I'll kill you.

438
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,400
Understand that?

439
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,000
You believe me?

440
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,000
Get out of the car.

441
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,200
Close the door.

442
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,600
- How am I supposed to make it back?
- Walk. Think about it.

443
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,600
Son of a bitch!

444
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,900
- Hi.
- Hi.

445
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,700
- Come in.
- Thank you.

446
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,600
So that's Billie's stuff.

447
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,200
Some from her old school,
some I put together.

448
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,200
You'll see a very different girl.

449
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,000
She'd gotten an award in her English class
just before she transferred.

450
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,700
Anyway, you'll see.

451
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,900
You know, I wish I'd done more.

452
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,800
- I really don't know what else to say.
- How about small talk?

453
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,700
- Okay. Can I get you a drink?
- No.

454
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,000
Thank you.

455
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,700
- Do you mind if I have one?
- No.

456
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,800
So did you attend college?

457
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,800
No, I went from high school
to professional baseball.

458
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,300
- Did you ever play in the majors?
- I was a shortstop. I tore up my shoulder.

459
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,500
Well, that would be a bad injury
for a shortstop.

460
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,700
- Fatal. You follow baseball, Dr. Summers?
- Yes, very closely.

461
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,300
- Do you mind living alone?
- No.

462
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,300
- Do you?
- No, I don't mind living alone.

463
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,000
I mind being alone.

464
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,700
- I feel funny talking to you like this.
- It's okay, I'm the police chief.

465
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,500
- We have reservations at The Gray Gull?
- Yes, we do.

466
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Now, if we eat first,

467
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,500
we're going to be
both thinking about afterwards

468
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,400
and how that's going to go,

469
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,300
- and we won't be able to enjoy our dinner.
- That is a problem.

470
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:50,900
So I think that we should
have the afterwards first.

471
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,500
Then we'd be free to
concentrate on a lovely dinner.

472
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,000
- So this was a first date?
- It wasn't exactly a date.

473
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,300
Sounds like a date to me.

474
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,100
- And you wanted to drink with her.
- Oh, yeah.

475
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,700
- But you didn't.
- No.

476
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,000
- Why?
- I have no idea.

477
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,100
Why did you want to?

478
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,800
Did you want a drink
at 2:35 in the afternoon?

479
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,900
- I'm not that far gone.
- I'll take that to mean no.

480
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,100
Why did you want to drink
at 7:00 in the evening?

481
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,400
What difference does it make?

482
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,300
None, to me.

483
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,600
I don't know. It was the end of the day.

484
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,900
She looked very good.
I mean, it was all ahead of us.

485
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,500
The romance of booze.

486
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,500
- You think that's what makes me drink?
- No. But it helps you want to.

487
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,100
This job in Paradise is my last stop.

488
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
I get off the bus here.

489
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,000
What we're doing here is
a little like when we're working a case.

490
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,500
There are incidents.

491
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,700
We don't know how these incidents connect,
but we register them,

492
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,600
note the sequence
and then we think about them.

493
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,600
- I'm paying you 150 bucks an hour, right?
- 165.

494
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,100
- Whatever. It's my time, right?
- Right.

495
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,500
What makes a kid change?

496
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,500
- How old a kid?
- About 12.

497
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,700
Change how?

498
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,100
Grades go in the tank, drugs, sex.

499
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,600
The long answer will cost you
a lot of money.

500
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,400
What's the short answer?

501
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,000
Most cases,
the common profile involves molestation.

502
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,800
Not always.

503
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,700
More often than people want to admit.

504
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,700
<i>"I was the shadow of the waxwing slain</i>

505
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,600
<i>"By the false azure in the windowpane</i>

506
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,900
<i>"I was the smudge of ashen fluff</i>

507
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,200
<i>"And I lived on, flew on, in the reflected sky</i>

508
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,700
<i>"And from the inside, too, I duplicate</i>

509
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,900
<i>"Myself, my lamp, an apple on a plate</i>

510
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,400
<i>"Uncurtaining the night I'd let dark glass</i>
<i>Hang all the furniture above the grass</i>

511
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,500
<i>"And how delightful when a fall of snow</i>

512
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,600
<i>"Covered my glimpse of lawn..."</i>

513
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,300
- Emily Bishop?
- Who wants to know?

514
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,300
I'm Chief Stone.

515
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,400
- Show me your badge.
- I don't have one.

516
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,500
- You don't have one?
- It's in a drawer. Show her your badge, Suit.

517
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,800
He is the Chief.

518
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,000
So what happened to my sister?

519
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,900
We think we found her floating in a lake.

520
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,700
You think?

521
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,700
The body is hard to identify.

522
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,800
Well, I know it's gonna end up being her.

523
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,900
- Didn't they mess her up.
- Who?

524
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,300
My parents.

525
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,500
Probably messed me up, too,
but I got out in time.

526
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,400
When Billie ran away,
do you know where she went?

527
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,500
- Someplace in Boston.
- You know where?

528
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,800
- Some nun runs it.
- She get along okay with Hooker?

529
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,100
Hooker was nice to her.

530
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,100
Look, half the guys in the school
were bopping her.

531
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,900
- Probably some older guys, too.
- Why do you say that?

532
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,000
Any names?

533
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,800
No.

534
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,900
She thought it made her popular.
I didn't want to hear about it.

535
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,300
Anything else that could help?

536
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,700
I think I have a letter from her
back in my room.

537
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,500
- I think it says the shelter's name in it.
- Can we get that?

538
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,300
He had to be one hard-ass son of a bitch.

539
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,100
Where'd he think she was gonna end up?

540
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,300
- You okay?
- Yeah, sure.

541
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,000
They're not gonna get me. I'm out of there.

542
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,200
I'm never going back.

543
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,800
Your father still pay your tuition?

544
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,900
You think he wants his little girl
to drop out of college?

545
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,000
It's good to be able to count on something.

546
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,900
He owes it to me.

547
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,500
I'm going to take him
for everything he's got if I can.

548
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,500
You got someone to talk to?

549
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,400
A shrink?

550
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,400
Might be good if you talked to him.

551
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,900
Are you sure you're a nun?

552
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,300
Pretty sure.

553
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,100
What about the rest of the staff?

554
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,500
It's pretty much a one-nun show.

555
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,400
- When was Billie here?
- Beginning of the summer.

556
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,700
- But she's not here now?
- No.

557
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,500
Would you tell me if she were?

558
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,300
It would depend on who you were
and why you wanted to know.

559
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,500
You know who I am.

560
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,500
A cop is a cop is a cop.

561
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,300
We think Billie was murdered.

562
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,300
Think?

563
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,200
Know, but can't prove.

564
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,900
Condition of the body makes it hard.

565
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,800
So when was the last time she was here?

566
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,200
About three weeks ago.

567
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,900
Do you know where she went when she left?

568
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:12,300
- Our girls tend to come and go.
- When they got nowhere else to stay.

569
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,000
I like to think that we provide
for their spiritual needs,

570
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,100
as well as a place to sleep.

571
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,900
So she was getting some money,
some of the time in exchange for something.

572
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,300
That'd be my guess.

573
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,000
Did you have any way of contacting her?

574
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,200
She left a phone number.

575
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,700
She said it was only for an emergency.

576
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,700
And I was only to give it to her sister
or somebody named Hooker.

577
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,500
Did you give it to either?

578
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,600
Neither of them asked.

579
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,300
Did you ever call the number?

580
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,100
That would be unethical.

581
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,400
May I have the number?

582
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,700
That would be unethical.

583
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,600
She's dead.

584
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,600
I'll get it for you.

585
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,200
Jesse,

586
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,500
there's something you need to know.

587
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,100
Jesse, are you listening?

588
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,600
Yes.

589
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,300
There's something you need to know.

590
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,600
I called the phone number you gave me.
It's a bit odd.

591
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,300
It's a company, Superior Promotions.

592
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,700
It deals with books. Big books. Bestsellers.

593
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,700
And it's owned by a town luminary,
Norman Shaw.

594
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,500
The writer?

595
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,200
And Vivian Snyder called.

596
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,500
Did she tell him?

597
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,900
She's moved out. Filed for divorce.

598
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,300
Good for her.

599
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,500
She can't win them all,
but she might've won this one.

600
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,600
That's all I know. I'm going home.

601
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,300
That's good police work.
Keep it up and you'll get a promotion.

602
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,700
Yeah, but the sexist bastards
already made you Chief.

603
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,200
You believe Hank Bishop
about why he didn't report her missing?

604
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,000
- I think so.
- I don't. He's a cold bastard.

605
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,600
He threw a 14-year-old out on the street.

606
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,100
Well, he didn't really throw her out. She left.

607
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:35,300
But he made a big mistake,
and I think he knows it.

608
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:39,000
A guy like that draws a line in the sand.
He can't go back.

609
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,700
- So what do your instincts say?
- You mean my coply intuition?

610
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,700
- Yeah.
- Nothing.

611
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,500
Yeah, but you got a hunch.

612
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,900
No, I don't. I don't have a clue.

613
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,500
I'm waiting to get one.

614
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:12,400
- Jesse, what are we doing here?
- We're fighting crime.

615
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,300
I'm Norman Shaw.

616
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,900
Nice to meet you, sir.

617
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,800
Your officer here seems to think
we need to talk.

618
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,000
Well, actually, he's not my officer,
he's yours. He works for the town.

619
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,500
Casuistry aside,

620
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,100
- I need to speak to the man in charge.
- That would be me.

621
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,400
Good. I'm sure you can tell the officer

622
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,500
that party patrol is hardly the best use
of a policeman's time.

623
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,900
- We've had a complaint, sir.
- And that would be?

624
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,000
Noise.

625
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,500
Punishable by death?
It's a party, for God sakes.

626
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,600
The Lieutenant Governor's here,
several state reps and a congressman.

627
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:19,100
My attorney is here.
Do I need to get him down here?

628
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,900
Chills run up and down my spine.

629
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,000
It appears that cars are parked illegally.

630
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,500
- You'll have to move them.
- Cars? You want me to move cars.

631
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,200
- Yes, I do.
- Well, I'm not going to do that.

632
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,200
Officer Simpson,
would you call Frankie's Tow

633
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,400
and have them start hooking up?

634
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,200
You can't tow all these cars.

635
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,600
And when you're finished,
start interviewing the guests.

636
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,800
- For what reason?
- Noise. Obstructing access.

637
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,200
Listen, you don't want to ruin this party.

638
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,500
- This is a charity event.
- I don't wanna ruin your party.

639
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,900
But cars need to be moved.
Behavior needs to be modified.

640
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,500
We'll move the cars. And we'll quiet down.

641
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,400
And I'll have your job.

642
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,300
Probably not.

643
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,200
What's casuistry mean?

644
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,700
I don't know.

645
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:14,600
I think you couldn't stay away from me,
and that's why you had to crash the party.

646
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,700
Exactly.

647
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,100
So why do we think
it had something to do with Norman Shaw?

648
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,500
Or someone on that list.

649
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,300
I don't know. Maybe you're just paranoid.

650
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,700
Pretty impressive.
Lieutenant Governor, state reps...

651
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,100
You know, if I were really paranoid,

652
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,700
I might think
that your disruption cost me money.

653
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,300
And Norman Shaw is a local institution
and a generous benefactor.

654
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,700
You're upset.

655
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,400
I'm a little upset.

656
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,200
It's nothing that can't be overcome.

657
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,100
Why are the Bishops crossed out?

658
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,600
Well, what's a family fundraiser
without a family?

659
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,200
But the Bishop family
always attended in the past.

660
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,700
Since they've been here.

661
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,400
Being a man of limited means,

662
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,700
what can I do to compensate you
for whatever loss the disruption caused?

663
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,400
You could make love to me in a jail cell.

664
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,300
Not one of mine.

665
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,000
- How about your office?
- Can't.

666
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,700
- Because?
- Might embarrass the department.

667
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,900
A headmistress isn't supposed
to do that kind of thing, either.

668
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,300
But the risk is part of the fun.

669
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,300
Lilly, this is what I am,

670
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:32,700
I'm divorced from the only woman
I seem to be able to love.

671
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,300
I'm trying not to drink too much.

672
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,800
I can't play professional baseball
like I'm supposed to.

673
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:42,500
All I can be is a cop in a small town
and this is my last chance at that.

674
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,600
- And you don't wanna jeopardize that.
- I can't. Not for fun.

675
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,300
But if it involves trapezes, bobsleds
or hay balers, I'm your guy.

676
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,500
It's Billie Bishop. Dental charts confirmed it.

677
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,600
We've approximated the time of death

678
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,700
somewhere between the 8th and the 9th.

679
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,400
Killer didn't dump the body
in the middle of the day.

680
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,100
That means the evening of the 8th
or early on the 9th.

681
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,500
Lieutenant Governor. Norman Shaw.

682
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,600
- Impressive list of people.
- You know anybody else on that list?

683
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,600
Representative Kelly.

684
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,500
I know Leo Finn.

685
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,200
Who's Leo Finn?

686
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,800
Solid citizen.

687
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,600
Runs drugs and gambling in the North End.

688
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,900
- Prostitution?
- No way.

689
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,300
Prostitution would
offend Leo's moral sensibilities.

690
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,800
What's your interest in Norman Shaw?

691
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,700
I'm a big fan.

692
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,400
I see.

693
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:49,400
In your travels,
there's something you should know.

694
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,200
Leo Finn has a gunsel.

695
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,900
He's always around.

696
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,100
He's a stone-cold killer.

697
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,600
Neither of them should be taken lightly.

698
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Development Associates.

699
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,100
- I'm Leo Finn.
- Jesse Stone.

700
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,100
The parking czar.

701
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,000
I prefer Chief Stone.

702
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,200
I remember seeing you at the party.

703
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,800
Oh, good for you.

704
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
What brings you to Boston?

705
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,800
And you are?

706
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,300
This is my associate, Lovey Norris.

707
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,700
Nice to meet you, Lovey.

708
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,600
What exactly does
Development Associates do?

709
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,200
- Development.
- Of?

710
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,800
Of our best interests.

711
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,500
How well do you know Norman Shaw?

712
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,900
You tell me.

713
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,800
This isn't going very well, is it?

714
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,500
I'm gonna be honest with you, Jesse.

715
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,200
Since we've known each other...

716
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:08,000
Been close personal friends for, what,
two or three minutes now.

717
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,800
- Norman Shaw is a business associate.
- Development?

718
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,100
- No.
- Books?

719
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,200
- Our relationship is confidential.
- Oh, you can tell me. Just between friends.

720
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,500
Well, if I told you,
it wouldn't be confidential now, would it?

721
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,600
It was very nice meeting you.

722
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,700
Billie was lost to us a long time ago.

723
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,700
And when did you notice a change?

724
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,100
Almost from the time we moved here.

725
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,800
And when was that?

726
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,900
Two years ago. Just before school started.

727
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,700
I should've reported her missing
the day that she left.

728
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,600
Yes, sir, you should have.

729
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,200
What can I do to help?

730
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,400
You could give us a DNA sample.

731
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,200
We think Billie must've been in contact
with someone in Paradise

732
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,800
after she ran away.

733
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:20,900
Who?

734
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,500
We don't know.

735
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,600
Excuse me.

736
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,700
He could have given her just enough money

737
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,300
to make sure she'd come back for more.

738
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,800
For what reason?

739
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,900
I saw a book in Billie's room
by Norman Shaw.

740
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,400
Could I have it?

741
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,500
I'll get it for you.

742
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,600
So you attended Shaw's fundraiser
every year?

743
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,300
You're telling me it was Shaw?

744
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,700
I didn't say that. What's he like?

745
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,100
Jesse...

746
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,700
Very philanthropic.

747
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,100
- Always nice to the kids.
- Good for him.

748
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,600
- Jesse!
- Suit, it's gonna have to wait.

749
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,600
It can't.

750
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,200
Put this on.

751
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,100
Snyder's in there with his wife.

752
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,700
I tried to go in,
but the son of a bitch took a shot at me.

753
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,800
- Carole got out in the chaos.
- I got out...

754
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,100
I got away when he shot Mr. Kim.

755
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,800
- Did he kill him?
- I don't know.

756
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:34,100
He was on the floor and he was bleeding,

757
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,600
but he was still moving.

758
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,000
Molly, you got a piece of paper?

759
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,800
- Four aisles?
- Yeah.

760
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,300
Carole, okay,

761
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,900
now where did the shooting take place?

762
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,600
Here.

763
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,300
- Was Snyder holding his wife?
- Yeah.

764
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,600
Where?

765
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,000
- Here.
- Any other people in the market?

766
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:01,500
- How many?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

767
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,500
It's okay. It's all right.

768
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,000
- Jesse, we gotta go in.
- I called the state police.

769
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,400
We can't wait. We'll go in the back.

770
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,200
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- Stay here with Carole.

771
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,800
- That's all?
- If Snyder comes out alone, kill him.

772
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,600
What do you want me to do?

773
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,100
When the shooting starts,
you'll know what to do.

774
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,400
Two in the chest. One in the head.

775
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,200
Continue to engage
until the threat is eliminated.

776
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,900
You stop right there!

777
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,400
I said stop!

778
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,700
I'm stopped.

779
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,500
- You put your gun down.
- No.

780
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,400
Put your gun down.

781
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,600
- I'm glad you're here, Stone.
- Why? Did you miss me?

782
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,500
I got no life without her.

783
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,800
She ain't gonna leave me.
And I ain't gonna leave her. Not ever.

784
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,500
Jerry, if you love her, let her go.

785
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,200
I'm gonna kill you
and everybody in this place.

786
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,700
No, you're not.

787
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,600
Jerry, stop!

788
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,800
He's down, Suit.

789
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,900
Mr. Simpson is stabilized. He's in recovery.

790
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,100
The next 48 hours are critical.

791
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,600
And Mr. Kim?

792
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,900
Mr. Kim was dead on arrival.

793
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,800
Mr. Simpson will be
in recovery for some time.

794
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,600
Then we'll move him into Intensive Care.

795
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:52,200
- We'll keep you up to date, Chief Stone.
- Thank you, Doctor.

796
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,700
I'm staying.

797
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,500
There's something I gotta do.

798
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,200
Can you handle the station for a while,
Tony?

799
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,400
Sure thing, Skipper.

800
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,500
Page me if anything changes.

801
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,300
Obviously, I was way out of line.

802
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,900
This apology is long overdue.

803
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,300
I may need something in writing.

804
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,500
I'd be happy to do that, sir.

805
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,900
Look, your party was for a very good cause.

806
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,200
I just wish more people
would take an interest in our youngsters.

807
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,500
I do what I can.

808
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,600
And the idea of having the young people
attend with their parents,

809
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,500
I think, creates a great sense of community.

810
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,700
How long have you been doing this?

811
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,200
About 10 years. Since I moved here.

812
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,000
Good for you.

813
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,600
- You know Billie Bishop?
- Excuse me?

814
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,700
Hank and Sandy Bishop's kid?

815
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,900
Well, I take an interest
in all my young people.

816
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,700
Good for you.

817
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,700
Where were you
on the night of September 8th?

818
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,400
- Excuse me?
- Where were you

819
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,500
- the night of September 8th?
- I heard what you said.

820
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,200
I want to know why you're asking me that.

821
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,900
'Cause I'm the police chief.

822
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,900
Well, I don't think
that's any of your business.

823
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,200
On the contrary, I think it is.

824
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,100
Billie Bishop's dead.

825
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:02,900
We found a body floating in the lake.
You probably read about it.

826
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:06,400
Oh, come on, Norman,
she's one of your young people.

827
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,000
- What was the date?
- September 8th.

828
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:18,100
September 8th...

829
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,000
I was with a business associate.

830
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,600
- Who?
- Leo Finn.

831
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,800
Would he remember the meeting?

832
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,700
Yes, I'm sure he would.
It was rather lengthy,

833
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,800
we have creative differences.

834
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,700
He's the subject of my next book.

835
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,200
Between you and me, it's an expos.

836
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:43,300
Chief Stone, I think this meeting's at an end.

837
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,000
When can I expect that apology?

838
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,300
You can't.

839
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,900
Norman Shaw says
you had a long meeting with him

840
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:59,000
the night of the 8th.

841
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,400
What's he need an alibi for?

842
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,600
You tell me.

843
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,900
I did call a meeting, but I canceled it.

844
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:10,000
- Because you're fickle?
- Because he's a scumbag.

845
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,500
This have something to do

846
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,400
with the confidential nature
of your relationship?

847
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,800
I don't want a guy like that
writing my biography.

848
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:20,600
- Why don't you have Lovey kill him?
- Why don't you kiss my ass?

849
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,000
So a guy like what?

850
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,300
All right, I'm not gonna cover
for that son of a bitch.

851
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,500
Because?

852
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,800
Because he molests kids.

853
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,200
He uses his fundraisers to meet them.

854
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:41,100
- How do you know?
- Had Lovey keeping tabs on him.

855
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:45,200
He saw him go into this motel
a couple of times with a kid.

856
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,300
You know her name?

857
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,300
No, he does not know her name.

858
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,000
Was she about 14?

859
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,000
Yes.

860
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,800
Can you talk?

861
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,100
He can talk,

862
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,300
but he's not going to testify.

863
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,800
You do your job. You'll find out.

864
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,300
- What's the name of the motel?
- That's all you're gonna get.

865
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:17,100
"In the morning, at 7:15, sitting in his office,

866
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,900
"he felt a little guilty and a little shaky.

867
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,500
"He tried coffee, but the coffee didn't help.

868
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,500
"At 9:10, a woman walked in.

869
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,700
"She was wearing big gold-hooped earrings
and rings on four fingers.

870
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:32,900
"She had the kind of lips
that made me want to mash them in for her."

871
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,200
He's in a coma.

872
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,100
When?

873
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,200
Doctor came in about an hour ago.

874
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,300
I thought he was asleep.

875
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,600
When my sister got sick,

876
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,800
things got pretty scary
when she got like this.

877
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:57,800
I'd just sit with her at the hospital.

878
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:02,000
Doctor told me to talk to her, read to her.

879
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,700
Said sometimes it would
help people find their way back.

880
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:14,200
I don't know if it helped or not,
but it sure made me feel better.

881
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,100
Did it work?

882
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,200
She died.

883
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:23,200
I'm not gonna let that happen again.

884
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:31,000
Why don't you take a break, Molly?
I'll be here.

885
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,700
Talk to him.

886
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,200
Let him know you're here.

887
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,600
I found this in the wheel well
next to the spare tire.

888
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,800
Good. I'll bet you the cut end matches
the piece we found at the lake.

889
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,400
Think we could match the cinder blocks?

890
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:41,500
I doubt it. See if you can find
the name of the motel that Shaw used.

891
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,300
Maybe the manager can remember him
or Billie Bishop.

892
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:48,100
And interview everyone
at Superior Promotions.

893
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,900
Billie used that number.

894
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,300
I called my attorney. He's on his way here.

895
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,700
Said to stop everything until he arrives.

896
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:57,000
- Did you show Norman the warrant?
- I did.

897
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,600
Anything in there

898
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,800
about stopping everything
till his lawyer gets here?

899
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,900
I should have
had your head on a platter last time.

900
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,600
I will not make the same mistake again.

901
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,800
You're under arrest
for the murder of Billie Bishop.

902
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,700
My attorney will have me out in an hour.

903
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,800
You need to be a little more careful,
Norman. You could start a fire that way.

904
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,100
- You can't do that.
- Oh, sure I can.

905
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:38,500
- Whose cigar is that, Officer D'Angelo?
- Norman Shaw's.

906
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:44,700
Child killers don't do well in prison.
You need to think about that.

907
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,800
Take him to County.

908
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I would never hurt Billie.

909
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,300
You have the right to remain silent.

910
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,100
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

911
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,600
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney...

912
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,300
Jesse, it's not your fault.

913
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:10,600
No, but it's my responsibility.

914
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,000
How is he?

915
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,100
No change.

916
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:17,900
- Do you really think Norman killed her?
- I know it.

917
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,000
Well, you must have had other suspects.

918
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,800
What about Hank Bishop?

919
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,400
Not all fathers are child molesters.

920
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,100
I didn't say that.

921
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,000
I know you didn't.

922
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,200
At a certain point it just became obvious.

923
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,300
Some cases are hard, some are easy.
This one was easy.

924
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,700
Everything started to point toward Shaw.

925
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,000
He was stupid.

926
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,800
He obviously panicked,
didn't cover his tracks.

927
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:43,500
That makes you angry, doesn't it?

928
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,900
I hate child molesters
more than convicts do.

929
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,500
That's the part of you
that doesn't always show.

930
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:55,600
It's the cold part of you,
without sentiment, without mercy.

931
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,600
It's frightening.

932
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:00,400
- People are more than one thing.
- I know.

933
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,100
I know you feel compassion.

934
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,700
I know that you found Billie's killer
partly because you felt

935
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,600
somehow you owed it to her.

936
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,400
I did owe it to her.

937
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,000
I'm also employed to do that.

938
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:15,600
Well, maybe that part of you,
the remorseless part.

939
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,900
The part that looks at the world
with an icy stare.

940
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:22,600
Maybe that's why you can do
what you're employed to do.

941
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,700
I'll be at the hospital.
Anthony's gotta get home.

942
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:34,900
- We still have to work here sometime.
- I know that.

943
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,400
I know you know. I'll be over in a while.

944
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,100
- Stupid.
- What are you doing?

945
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,100
Should've tied a bowline.

946
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,400
I phoned, got an answering machine.

947
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,700
- You short-handed?
- Yes, we are.

948
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:57,800
- We have to talk about Norman Shaw.
- Norman Shaw.

949
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,200
He's home.
His attorney had him out in an hour.

950
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,600
That figures.

951
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,400
When the DNA comes back,
it's not gonna be Hank Bishop.

952
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,200
It's not gonna be Hooker Royce.

953
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,600
It's not gonna be some kid in school.

954
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,300
It's gonna be Shaw.

955
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,500
- How do you know?
- I just know.

956
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,800
Then we'll have him.

957
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,200
Well, not for murder, you won't.

958
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,300
The D.A.'s office is not going into court

959
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:26,400
with two cinder blocks, a piece of rope
and a bottle of pills.

960
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,600
- He doesn't have an alibi.
- Neither does half of Paradise.

961
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,400
He had a motive and he had the opportunity.

962
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:37,300
- He's a sick son of a bitch.
- Boy, he's a sick son of a bitch.

963
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,100
- Says he was in love with the girl.
- And you believe him?

964
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,400
I didn't say that.

965
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,300
He knows she was pregnant.
He knows he's the father.

966
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,300
- That's a motive.
- Or not.

967
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,100
Look, he knows we'll have him
when the DNA comes back.

968
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,300
He'll plead to the molestation.

969
01:13:55,900 --> 01:14:00,000
A guy willing to do time like that
has a certain credibility.

970
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,400
He killed Billie.

971
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,500
How do you know?

972
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,900
If you can't come up with anything else,

973
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,800
at least we'll have him for the molestation.

974
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,900
I'll get more.

975
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,100
Molly.

976
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,600
Go home and get some sleep.

977
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,200
I'm okay.

978
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,500
You can only do what you can do.

979
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,100
I went over to Lilly Summers' house

980
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,000
to take her to dinner.

981
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,000
I'm not going to tell you.
I'll tell you if you wake up.

982
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:50,000
D.A.'s behaving like a horse's ass again.

983
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,400
Won't prosecute the murder.

984
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:59,300
Oh, that's right, you don't know.

985
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,500
We got him. We got Shaw.

986
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:07,500
We found cinder blocks, pills and rope.

987
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,700
Of course, we couldn't have done
any of this without the ring.

988
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,400
That's good police work, Suit.

989
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,600
Well...

990
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,100
Listen to this.

991
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,000
What an ego.

992
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,900
"An avid yachtsman,

993
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,600
<i>"Sargasso Sea</i> is
Norman Shaw's 28th book."

994
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,900
"Avid yachtsman."

995
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:40,700
Square knot turns into a slip knot
when you pull the long end.

996
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:44,200
Up comes the body
and we're off to the races. Just stupid.

997
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,100
Made it so easy.

998
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,000
You called me?

999
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,900
I appreciate you coming. You too, Lovey.

1000
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,700
Look, I know I owe you, Leo.

1001
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:38,700
You gave me Shaw,
but I need a little help here.

1002
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:42,500
I'm just a small-town cop.
Mostly, I give out parking tickets.

1003
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,600
I don't have enough
to put this guy away for murder.

1004
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,200
- That's your problem.
- Oh, I thought it was our problem,

1005
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,800
knowing how we hate child molesters.

1006
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,400
So I don't get it, Leo.

1007
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,300
You tell me the guy doesn't have an alibi,

1008
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:58,700
but you won't let Lovey
give me the name of the motel.

1009
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,100
I got an officer in the hospital.
I only got two other people.

1010
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,900
Why won't you tell me
the name of the motel?

1011
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,600
The Paradise Motel.

1012
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,300
Okay. Thank you.

1013
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,100
I know it well, used to live there.

1014
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,400
So why all the mystery, Leo?

1015
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,400
Because I don't like you.

1016
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,900
I'm hurt. A couple of more things?

1017
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,500
- Fire away.
- Nice phrasing.

1018
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:25,200
See, I got some problems.

1019
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,900
I mean, the only way an amateur like Shaw
would drug and drown a kid

1020
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:33,500
would be if she threatened to expose him,
but I got no proof of that.

1021
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,200
In fact, she called her mom.
Said she was happy.

1022
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,600
- Oh, good for her.
- She was pregnant, by the way.

1023
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,600
Boy, this guy couldn't even tie a knot.

1024
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,800
A pro like Lovey here
would know how to dispose of a body.

1025
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:56,000
You'd tie a bowline, wouldn't you, Lovey?

1026
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:03,100
Hey, you know how
Shaw refers to his book?

1027
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,400
He calls it an expos.

1028
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:09,200
Does that sound like a biography to you?

1029
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,500
Sounds like a betrayal to me.

1030
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:15,700
Well, to me
it sounds like this meeting is over.

1031
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,500
Come on, hear me out.

1032
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,400
See, all this stuff started me thinking.

1033
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,900
I mean, what if the killer wasn't stupid?

1034
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,000
What if he was really smart?

1035
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:31,300
What if the killer wanted
the body discovered?

1036
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:35,200
- Why would Shaw do that?
- I'm not talking about Shaw.

1037
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:41,600
See, just between you and me,
I think the mute over there whacks people.

1038
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,900
But if you whack Norman Shaw,
that's big news.

1039
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:47,600
And his expos gets published big-time.

1040
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:51,700
But if a child molester gets
convicted of murdering a kid,

1041
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,500
no publisher in the world
would touch that book.

1042
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:58,500
See, I think you did
have that meeting with Shaw.

1043
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,600
I think you set him up, then you set me up.

1044
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:04,800
Dropped bread crumbs,
led me around by the nose.

1045
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:09,700
I think you're a sick son of a bitch
and you killed a kid to solve your problem.

1046
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,000
Kiss my ass.

1047
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,800
I got him, Billie.

1048
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,500
