1
00:00:01,962 --> 00:00:03,381
‐ Swish, swish, bish.

2
00:00:03,381 --> 00:00:05,093
It's me, Sarah.

3
00:00:05,093 --> 00:00:06,722
And I am so fucking sick
of thinking

4
00:00:06,722 --> 00:00:08,308
about stupid Brett Kavanaugh.

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,437
Honestly, if I think
of his frowny pink face

6
00:00:10,437 --> 00:00:13,694
and his Pert Plus hair
one more time, I'm gonna puke.

7
00:00:13,694 --> 00:00:16,199
Trump even held a ceremony
for Kavanaugh

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,205
where he apologized
on behalf of the nation,

9
00:00:19,205 --> 00:00:22,336
declared victory, as always,
and added:

10
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:26,804
‐ You, sir,
under historic scrutiny,

11
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:28,599
were proven innocent.

12
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:32,064
‐ And you, sir,
under historic scrutiny,

13
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:35,362
will be poopin' in a cell.

14
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:37,283
I'm very proud of that.

15
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:40,915
So now Kavanaugh's on the court
and ready to decide the case

16
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,253
of "tastes great"
versus "less filling."

17
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:45,633
What's even more upsetting
is the GOP is seeing

18
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:48,681
an actual bump
from this Kavanaugh shit.

19
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,475
‐ The Kavanaugh bump is real.

20
00:00:50,475 --> 00:00:51,770
‐ Shut up, dummy.

21
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,524
God, I wish I could get through

22
00:00:53,524 --> 00:00:55,360
to the 52% of white women

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,323
who put Trump in office,
but they are‐‐

24
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:58,826
they're too far gone.

25
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:01,623
So, instead, I am looking
to young people.

26
00:01:01,623 --> 00:01:03,001
Young Thug.

27
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:04,546
Young Dolph.

28
00:01:04,546 --> 00:01:05,632
Lil Pump.

29
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,301
Lil Uzi Vert.

30
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,723
But also young people
who aren't rappers.

31
00:01:09,723 --> 00:01:13,104
Because only 23%
of young people voted at all

32
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:15,233
in the 2014 midterms.

33
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:17,279
And I know you don't want
to hear this from me,

34
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:20,243
your Auntie Sarah‐‐
who happens to have

35
00:01:20,243 --> 00:01:23,124
a cherry bomb of a caboose,
by the way‐‐

36
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,505
so take it from your buddy
Taylor Swift.

37
00:01:25,505 --> 00:01:28,259
T‐Swift has never
been political before,

38
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,138
but this week,
she went on Instagram

39
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:32,894
and said she would vote
for two Democrats in Tennessee,

40
00:01:32,894 --> 00:01:35,107
and it is a very big deal,

41
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:37,862
because Taylor has
a massive amount of reach.

42
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:41,160
She has 112 million
Instagram followers.

43
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,580
She's not just a pop star,

44
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,210
she has the following
of two Italys.

45
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,799
And Republicans'
knee‐jerk reaction, of course,

46
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,845
is to tell her
to stay out of politics.

47
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:53,351
Hey. You can't give Kanye a
free ticket to the White House

48
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:55,815
and then tell Taylor
to stay in her lane.

49
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,403
They are both
taxpaying citizens.

50
00:01:58,403 --> 00:02:00,575
They can talk about
whatever they want.

51
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:03,496
You know who should shut up?
Tax dodgers.

52
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:05,250
Which would be great,
because then we wouldn't

53
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,131
have to hear from big fat
President Dumbshit.

54
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:10,385
And yes, Taylor's a little late
to the game

55
00:02:10,385 --> 00:02:13,099
and waited until the American
leg of her tour was over

56
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,105
to speak up, but hey,
better late than never,

57
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:18,276
ever getting back together.

58
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:20,280
Fuck, her songs are so catchy.

59
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,242
Look what you made me do.

Wow.

What an attractive audience.

73
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,157
I'm gonna have to take a cold
shower before the monologues.

74
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:04,786
Oh, there's no time?
That's okay.

75
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:05,913
I'll do it horny.

76
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:07,584
[laughter]

77
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:09,921
I want to talk to you guys
about climate change.

78
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:12,677
Wait, don't switch over
to "Bosch"!

79
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:14,556
Hurricane Michael
just happened.

80
00:03:14,556 --> 00:03:16,560
It's the third
most powerful storm

81
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,564
ever on record to hit the U. S.

82
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:20,902
It was big.
It was on every channel.

83
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:23,197
But you know what is not
on every channel?

84
00:03:23,197 --> 00:03:25,786
The reason these storms
are getting more powerful

85
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:27,205
and more frequent.

86
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:29,251
God punishing gays.

87
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,755
[laughter]

88
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:33,594
No, it's climate change.
It's climate change.

89
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:36,390
And I know climate change
is not the most exciting issue,

90
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,102
and the media knows it too,

91
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:41,192
which is part of why
it's covered so infrequently.

92
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:43,656
Here is MSNBC anchor
Chris Hayes

93
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,826
responding to the question
of why he's not airing

94
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,622
more segments
on climate change.

95
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:56,430
You know what's
a great incentive?

96
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,476
We're all gonna fucking die.

97
00:03:58,476 --> 00:04:00,063
How about that
for an incentive?

98
00:04:00,063 --> 00:04:01,525
[laughter]

99
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:03,236
Look, my show would get
better ratings

100
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:07,620
if I just described the dongs
of dudes I've dated.

101
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,083
But climate change
is an emergency,

102
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,007
and one you definitely will not
get a presidential alert for.

103
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:17,055
So maybe this gets shared
a little less than normal,

104
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:21,480
but I feel compelled to use
my platform to speak out.

105
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,986
Granted, my platform is on
the third‐largest

106
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:25,321
streaming network of three.

107
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:26,950
[laughter]

108
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,331
So it's not so much
shouting from the rooftops

109
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:33,630
as, like, complaining
at an open mic at Panera Bread.

110
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,513
[laughter]

111
00:04:37,513 --> 00:04:39,684
Still, this is happening,
so put down

112
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:43,024
your broccoli cheddar soup
and buckle up.

113
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:45,905
This past week, the UN's
intergovernmental panel

114
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:49,328
on climate change‐‐
let's call it IPCC‐‐

115
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:52,375
released a report showing
that, on our current path,

116
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,131
we will face apocalyptic levels
of flooding,

117
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:58,806
wildfires, and famine by 2040.

118
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:01,102
Which is not just
in our lifetime,

119
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:03,022
but really fucking soon.

120
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:04,901
It's 2040!

121
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:09,201
Cardi B will be, like‐‐
ew, my age, gross.

122
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:10,704
[laughter]

123
00:05:10,704 --> 00:05:12,959
I know there are
so many problems right now‐‐

124
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,004
you know, people can't
afford rent

125
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:18,637
and face crushing student loan
debt and medical bankruptcy.

126
00:05:18,637 --> 00:05:20,975
White supremacy is being
further entrenched

127
00:05:20,975 --> 00:05:22,770
by a far right‐wing government.

128
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,526
Taco Bell still hasn't made
the Naked Chicken Chalupa

129
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,905
a permanent menu item.

130
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:31,162
But we cannot ignore the meteor
hurtling towards Earth

131
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:33,584
just because our house
is on fire.

132
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,506
2018 is on track
to be the fourth hottest year

133
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:38,259
in recorded history.

134
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:39,846
You want to guess
what the first, second,

135
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:41,223
and third hottest years are?

136
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:44,021
Too late, it was
the last three years.

137
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:45,983
This is fucking happening,

138
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:49,072
despite what
Fox News grandpas think.

139
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:53,331
Unfortunately, a Fox News
grandpa is our president.

140
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:55,836
‐ So Obama's talking
about all of this

141
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:57,840
with the global warming
and the‐‐

142
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,384
a lot of it's a hoax,
it's a hoax.

143
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:01,472
I mean, it's
a money‐making industry, okay?

144
00:06:01,472 --> 00:06:03,392
‐ Yeah, it's a hoax,
like Sandy Hook

145
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:06,190
or the Holocaust
or you making women cum.

146
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,860
[laughter]

147
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,156
You know, one of those hoaxes
that 97%

148
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:13,246
of the world's scientists
are in cahoots on.

149
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:15,876
I don't think I've ever said
the word "cahoots" before.

150
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,838
Cahoots, it sounds Yiddish.

151
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:19,968
I think it's a Yiddish word
for having diarrhea

152
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:21,345
in a public square.

153
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:24,852
[laughter]

154
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,982
Look, the Paris Agreement
was meant to keep

155
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:29,612
global warming
to under 2.6 degrees.

156
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:32,535
Even in the unlikely event
we hit that target,

157
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:34,789
there is a good chance
we are totally fucked

158
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:37,043
and we cannot get un‐fucked.

159
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:39,423
‐ Excuse me, Sarah?

160
00:06:39,423 --> 00:06:42,137
Hi, I'm a dumb guy,

161
00:06:42,137 --> 00:06:44,474
and I'm having trouble
following all these stats

162
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:47,355
on account of
my oatmeal‐like brain.

163
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:48,567
‐ Oh, right, okay.

164
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:49,736
Two point six degrees

165
00:06:49,736 --> 00:06:51,071
does not sound like a big deal.

166
00:06:51,071 --> 00:06:52,700
You need something
more visceral.

167
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,954
‐ Visceral? Sorry.

168
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:58,879
My vocabulary is very not big.

169
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,799
Again, I'm an idiot.

170
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:05,601
‐ Got it. You need to hear what
bad things are gonna happen.

171
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,353
You know how Miami is a city?

172
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:09,024
‐ Yeah.

173
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:11,654
‐ It's going to instead
be the ocean.

174
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:13,533
‐ Awesome.

175
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,415
Like my favorite movie,
"Waterworld."

176
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:19,336
‐ Oh, you have bad taste,
'cause you're dumb.

177
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:21,591
‐ Bingo. Bingo, bingo.
SARAH: Okay.

178
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:23,177
How about this?

179
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:24,972
New York City will be as hot
as the tropics,

180
00:07:24,972 --> 00:07:26,810
and the tropics
will grow so hot,

181
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,647
they will be uninhabitable.

182
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:30,984
Hurricanes and typhoons
and wildfires

183
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,030
will just become the weather.

184
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,451
Tens of millions
of climate refugees

185
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:36,913
will have to flee their homes

186
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:39,627
because of rising sea levels
or famine.

187
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,046
And for those of you
with no empathy,

188
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:42,967
that's not just in
other places.

189
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:44,177
It's here.

190
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:45,639
As all of Earth gets as hot

191
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,058
as sub‐Saharan Africa,

192
00:07:47,058 --> 00:07:49,187
mosquitoes will spread
across the globe,

193
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:52,945
infecting as many as 5 billion
people with malaria.

194
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:55,449
‐ I just shit my pants.

195
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:56,953
‐ Yeah,
it's fucking scary stuff.

196
00:07:56,953 --> 00:08:00,209
‐ I'm gonna go check
on my pants.

197
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:01,963
‐ Sounds like a plan.

198
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:03,800
You know, the last time
there was this much

199
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,469
climate change
in a short period,

200
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:09,060
it led to mass extinction
that killed 97%

201
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,939
of all life on Earth.

202
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:12,526
Meanwhile,
the Trump administration's

203
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:15,532
official response to all of it
is, "Fuck it."

204
00:08:15,532 --> 00:08:16,993
They're actually pushing
for more

205
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:18,705
environmental deregulation.

206
00:08:18,705 --> 00:08:21,376
Why? Because they're protecting
the interests

207
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,757
of a very small group
of absurdly rich

208
00:08:23,757 --> 00:08:24,842
and powerful people.

209
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:26,345
According to "The Guardian,"

210
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:29,017
71% of global carbon emissions

211
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:32,148
stem from just 100
corporations.

212
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:35,739
That's it, just 100
giant billionaire businesses

213
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:39,037
that filled the right pockets
to get the devil's job done.

214
00:08:39,037 --> 00:08:42,126
Our only chance for survival
is an about‐face,

215
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:43,922
investing in renewable energy,

216
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:45,801
which would not only
save the planet

217
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:48,430
but create an incredible boom
in jobs.

218
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,811
You know, California
incentivized clean energy

219
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:54,442
and, as a result, now has
eight and a half green jobs

220
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:56,990
for every one job
in fossil fuels.

221
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,583
Yet, the Trump administration
is actually suing to stop them.

222
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,296
Please follow the money
on that one.

223
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:05,591
So should we all just assume

224
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:07,595
we're truly and properly
fucked?

225
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:09,306
I mean, yes.

226
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:10,601
Sorry.

227
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:12,186
It's just,
it would be disingenuous

228
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:13,607
to sugarcoat it.

229
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:15,902
At the same time,
we cannot give up,

230
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:18,992
because fighting their nihilism
with more nihilism

231
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,704
is what they're banking on.

232
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:23,459
If we don't fight
these 100 corporations,

233
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:26,633
they get their money,
and we get to die.

234
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:30,807
And the fucking disgusting
irony of it, of all of it,

235
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:32,645
is that the billionaires
who have created

236
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:35,399
this global atrocity are gonna
be the ones to survive it.

237
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,153
They're gonna be fine.

238
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:40,326
While we all cook to death
in a planet‐sized hot car,

239
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:42,998
they will be safe
in their Martian bio‐dome,

240
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:46,756
stuffing robot sex slaves
in their penthouse fuck suite.

241
00:09:46,756 --> 00:09:49,260
[laughter]

242
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,102
So the only option is we react
to this massive

243
00:09:53,102 --> 00:09:55,899
state of emergency
with massive action.

244
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,653
We should be doing the opposite

245
00:09:57,653 --> 00:10:00,116
of every single thing
this administration is doing.

246
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:02,663
The world has to come together
to fight

247
00:10:02,663 --> 00:10:05,752
this man‐made apocalypse,
or we are fucked.

248
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:07,004
‐ We can't be consumed

249
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:09,426
by our petty differences
anymore.

250
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:12,432
We will be united
in our common interests.

251
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:16,566
‐ Wow, that was so,
like, not dumb.

252
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:20,657
‐ We will, once again,
be fighting for our freedom.

253
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,326
Not from tyranny, oppression,

254
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:26,251
or persecution,
but from annihilation.

255
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,299
And should we win the day,
the fourth of July

256
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:32,013
will no longer be known
as an American holiday.

257
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:35,562
‐ Wait. This is the speech from
the end of "Independence Day."

258
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:37,398
‐ Yeah, but it's
really good, and...

259
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:40,237
‐ I mean, swap aliens
for climate change

260
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:43,285
and it's pretty much the same‐‐
it's the same movie.

261
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:45,206
Wait, just finish it.
Finish your speech.

262
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:46,709
‐ Really?
SARAH: Yeah.

263
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,630
We're all gonna die anyway.

264
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,761
‐ We will not go quietly
into the night.

265
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:54,642
We will not vanish
without a fight.

266
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:56,604
We're going to live on.

267
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:59,025
We're going to survive.

268
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:04,829
Today, we celebrate
our Independence Day!

269
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,291
[cheers and applause]

270
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,005
‐ We'll be right back...
or will we?

271
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:20,401
‐ I was recently a guest

272
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:22,154
on "The Last Word
with Lawrence O'Donnell."

273
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:23,407
Oh, you don't believe me?

274
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:24,743
Well, you're gonna look
so dumb,

275
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:26,037
'cause I got video proof.

276
00:11:26,037 --> 00:11:27,290
Watch this.

277

<i>[percussive music]</i>

278
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:30,421
‐ Welcome back.
These days, so much

279
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:31,716
of our political conversation

280
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:32,926
happens on Twitter,

281
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,387
but what does this intersection

282
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:36,016
of politics and social media

283
00:11:36,016 --> 00:11:37,978
mean for our culture?

284
00:11:37,978 --> 00:11:40,441
We're joined by our panelists
in Los Angeles,

285
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:43,196
actor, comedian, and
politically active Twitter user

286
00:11:43,196 --> 00:11:44,909
Sarah Silverman.

287
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:46,996
And the right‐wing
Twitterverse's

288
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:49,042
newest superstar

289
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,503
Brambi Streeter.

290
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:52,256
Brambi, let's start with you.

291
00:11:52,256 --> 00:11:54,595
Earlier this week,
this tweet of yours

292
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:56,682
went viral, reading, quote,

293
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,603
"Why don't I need feminism?

294
00:11:58,603 --> 00:12:01,817
I have AR‐15 reasons."

295
00:12:01,817 --> 00:12:03,445
What were you trying to say?

296
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:04,698
‐ Well, Lawrence, there are

297
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:06,409
a lot of coastal elites

298
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,915
who want to make it illegal
to love America,

299
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:11,211
but real Americans know
defending liberty

300
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:13,883
is the most pro‐woman thing
of all.

301
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:15,595
‐ You know, no offense, Brambi,

302
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:19,561
but, honestly, it seems like
every conservative pundit

303
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:23,485
on TV reads from the same,
like, ten‐phrase glossary.

304
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:26,241
‐ Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you triggered?

305
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:28,161
Because the only
trigger warning I need

306
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:30,542
is "the safety is off."

307
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,169
‐ Eh.
[laughs]

308
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,548
That was a good one.
‐ I know.

309
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:35,217
‐ You know, I think
this exchange

310
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:36,428
leads me to my next question.

311
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:38,098
Is social media

312
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:39,685
making us more divided?

313
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:41,479
‐ You know, Lawrence,
I think in many ways,

314
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,816
it brings us together,

315
00:12:42,816 --> 00:12:43,818
and in many ways,

316
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:45,237
it does divide us.

317
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:47,283
Certainly, if you're only
getting your news

318
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:49,370
from Trump's
incoherent tweets‐‐

319
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,749
‐ President Trump lives
rent‐free

320
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:52,460
in your head every day.

321
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,842
‐ Brambi, take me through
how you came up with that.

322
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,598
‐ Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you triggered?

323
00:12:58,598 --> 00:13:00,392
Because the only
trigger warning I need

324
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:03,065
is "the safety is off."

325
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:04,902
‐ You said that already.

326
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:07,616
‐ [mockingly] "You said that
already."

327
00:13:07,616 --> 00:13:10,037
‐ Okay, first off,
I do sound like that.

328
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:11,247
Secondly,

329
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:12,374
who are you?

330
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,003
Like, where do you come from?

331
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:16,049

‐ You know, I don't know.

I‐I actually don't even know
where we got her.

340

‐ I did.
SARAH: What took you so long?

420

‐ You know, the straw
that broke the camel's back

421
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:23,251
for me were the baby
internment camps.

422
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,883
We're grabbing kids
from the breasts of mothers,

423

putting them into
detention facilities.

424
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:33,396
It's as cruel a policy
as we've ever seen inflicted

425
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:35,693
by the government
of the United States,

426
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:39,659
and it represents for me
this moment of finality,

427
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,955
the corruption
of the conservative movement,

428
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:45,003
of the Republican Party
as it's fully become

429
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:47,049
the party of Trump.

430
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:49,763
‐ You said the party of Trump
has to be obliterated.

431
00:17:49,763 --> 00:17:51,307
So how do we go about
doing that

432
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:54,606
that isn't a civil war
or an apocalypse?

433
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:58,112
‐ The way that it is repudiated
is through an election.

434
00:17:58,112 --> 00:18:00,325
It needs to be burned
to the ground.

435
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:03,247
The analogy I've used
is a forest fire.

436
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:06,045
A forest fire destroys
the forest,

437
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:09,594
but in its destruction,
it purifies it,

438
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:11,723
and new growth comes
as a result.

439
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,434
It's part of the natural
life cycle.

440
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:17,192

burned down.

446

We need to have two functioning
parties in a two‐party system.

447
00:18:33,517 --> 00:18:36,272
This moment that we have
with Trump,

448
00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:39,612
I think there's a real lack
of imagination in the country

449
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:41,950
for the magnitude
of the tragedy

450
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,165
someone as incompetent,
as ignorant as he

451
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,171
is able to cause from the power
that comes with that office.

452
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:49,841
‐ There are people
who cannot imagine

453
00:18:49,841 --> 00:18:52,680
that this could be true,
that a president can't lie,

454
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,809
and yet everything he says
is a lie.

455
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:57,648
He just has the cadence
of truth.

456
00:18:57,648 --> 00:19:00,069
He sounds like he's shooting
from the hip

457
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:03,284
and telling it like it is,
but he's not, he's lying.

458
00:19:03,284 --> 00:19:04,913
‐ He lies constantly,

459
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:06,165
he lied 3,000 times
in one year,

460
00:19:06,165 --> 00:19:07,502
and his lies are different

461
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:09,296
than typical politician lies.

462
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:12,512
Most politician lies
are self‐interested ones.

463
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:14,516
It's about self‐preservation.

464
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:16,393
You know, we think
about the most famous lie

465
00:19:16,393 --> 00:19:17,730
of the era, Bill Clinton,

466
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,316
"I didn't have sex
with that woman,"

467
00:19:19,316 --> 00:19:21,445
it's a lie of self‐interest.

468
00:19:21,445 --> 00:19:22,990
‐ I would say
weapons of mass destruction

469
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,830
is up there too.
No offense, my friend.

470
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,544
‐ I think mistakes and lies
are different things,

471
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,589
but the point with Trump
is this.

472
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:32,425
They're lies of authority.

473
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:36,810
Because it requires you
to submit to a proposition

474
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:40,275
that what is true is what
the leader believes is true.

475
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:44,826
So what we see is Donald Trump
going to mass rallies,

476
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:47,247
inciting the audience
with constant lying

477
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:51,130
and scapegoating vulnerable
minority populations.

478
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,802
Second thing he does
is he creates a sense

479
00:19:53,802 --> 00:19:56,766
of victimization
and virtue in victimization.

480
00:19:56,766 --> 00:20:00,231
He alleges conspiracies,
and then he asserts himself

481
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:03,154
as the protector, the avenger,

482
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:06,620
of the afflicted, the aggrieved
and victimized populations

483
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,584
to protect them
from the deep state conspiracy

484
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:11,295
and the hordes
of, say, Mexicans

485
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:13,090
running across the border.

486
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,721
It's dangerous, it's illiberal,

487
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:17,683
and it's profoundly
un‐American,

488
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,396
and it's something
that needs to be repudiated

489
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:22,985
by the only people
who can repudiate it,

490
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:24,656
and that's the American people
in an election.

491
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:25,824
SARAH: Yeah.

492
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:26,910

I just, I can't‐‐
I can't like, fathom

495
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:35,176
that he's that smart,
even in an evil way,

496
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:38,015
but there is something
he's got that is‐‐

497
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,476
‐ He has an‐‐
‐ He knows what he's doing.

498
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:42,900
‐ He has an instinct
for incitement.

499
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,444
And what happened
was this inciter,

500
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,908
this performer,
this reality show star,

501
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:52,586
found his way to this ideology,
and he feeds off the crowd,

502
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:55,843
he fuels the anger,
he fuels the resentment,

503
00:20:55,843 --> 00:20:57,680
he picks up on it,
and he's made

504
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,809
a political movement out of it.

505
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:01,353
‐ It's not like
he's an evil genius.

506
00:21:01,353 --> 00:21:04,401
It truly is a gift,
that was, like‐‐

507

that has been given by...
the devil.

[laughter]

509
00:21:10,455 --> 00:21:12,752
You're still
a traditional conservative,

510
00:21:12,752 --> 00:21:15,465
so how do you reconcile
that you are out there

511
00:21:15,465 --> 00:21:18,137
pushing for a blue wave
these midterms?

512
00:21:18,137 --> 00:21:22,813
‐ Well, look, I‐‐ I'm an American
before I'm a Republican.

513
00:21:22,813 --> 00:21:24,901
I'm a small‐L liberal

514
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:27,531
in that I believe
in liberal democracy.

515
00:21:27,531 --> 00:21:29,493
I believe in pluralism.

516
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:33,794
I believe in the dignity
of the human being.

517
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:37,593
One of the institutions
that the Democratic Party

518
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:41,266
may be able to salvage
when it stands up

519
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:45,483
against Trumpism, defeats it,
is the Republican Party itself.

520
00:21:45,483 --> 00:21:49,449
Because the Republican Party
is an institution worth saving,

521
00:21:49,449 --> 00:21:52,330
and it's an institution
that can only be saved

522
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,961
at this moment in time
by the Democratic Party,

523
00:21:54,961 --> 00:22:00,429
who can defeat it and rebuke
Trumpism for all time.

524
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:03,102

of the Kavanaugh confirmation?

525

‐ It's a high price.

526
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:07,152
He may serve on that court
for 40 years.

527
00:22:07,152 --> 00:22:10,283
He could serve on that court
till he's in his 90s.

528
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:12,830
He could be on the court
in 2058,

529
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,376
and what will always be true
is half the country‐‐

530
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,921
‐ Oh, my God,
I'll be in my 30s.

531
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:18,633
‐ You'll be in your 30s.

532
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:22,182
Half the country will always
view him as illegitimate.

533
00:22:22,182 --> 00:22:24,812
They will always view it
as a corrupted process,

534
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:29,237
and so the net effect of this
is that the Supreme Court

535
00:22:29,237 --> 00:22:31,325
has been degraded
through this process,

536
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:34,916
and I don't care where you
come down on this issue,

537
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,669
but if you look at it
through this prism,

538
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:40,092
Chuck Grassley has been there
for 38 years.

539
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,806
Diane Feinstein has been there
for 26,

540
00:22:42,806 --> 00:22:45,353
which means those two
have worked together

541
00:22:45,353 --> 00:22:48,902
in a body of 100 people
for 26 years.

542
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:51,616
They're both pushing
90 years old.

543
00:22:51,616 --> 00:22:53,494
She's running for reelection.

544
00:22:53,494 --> 00:22:56,793
And this is the outcome
of the work product?

545
00:22:56,793 --> 00:23:00,049
This is the outcome we get?
Holy shit.

546
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:02,680
It's astounding‐‐
It's astounding to watch it.

547
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,186
And so the Senate looks like
a kangaroo court.

548
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:08,942
The judiciary committee
looks like

549
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:11,656
a kangaroo court on steroids.

550
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:16,874
The FBI‐‐ the FBI played the patsy here
with the sham investigation

551
00:23:16,874 --> 00:23:19,630
that it was ordered to conduct
by the White House,

552
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,091
and to, really,
a fundamental degree,

553
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:22,553
the only way that Kavanaugh

554
00:23:22,553 --> 00:23:25,474
could have ever demonstrated
worthiness

555
00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:29,107
for the seat for a lifetime
on the Supreme Court

556
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,946
was to withdraw
from the process,

557
00:23:31,946 --> 00:23:36,831
but his ambition
was more important,

558
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:40,171
superseded the integrity
of the institution.

559
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:43,511
‐ Who can beat Trump in 2020?

560
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:46,391
‐ The next president
will always have

561
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:50,232
opposite virtues
of the last president.

562
00:23:50,232 --> 00:23:53,155
Now, Democrats will make
a mistake if they get into

563
00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:55,451
a dishonest contest
with Donald Trump,

564
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:59,250
because it's impossible to beat
him in a dishonesty contest.

565
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,837
‐ He's the best at it.

566
00:24:00,837 --> 00:24:02,674
‐ And if you stand up,
and, you know,

567
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,887
with respect to Robert De Niro,

568
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:06,641
but if the message is,
"Fuck Trump,"

569
00:24:06,641 --> 00:24:09,772
well, Trump wins
the vileness contest too.

570
00:24:09,772 --> 00:24:12,443
And so what Democrats I think
need to understand

571
00:24:12,443 --> 00:24:16,326
is that there's a difference
between toughness and meanness.

572
00:24:16,326 --> 00:24:19,542
Meanness and cruelty
are different than toughness,

573
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,044
and the Democrats are gonna
need to have

574
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,380
a very tough candidate.

575
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,261
You're gonna see
a 20‐person field,

576
00:24:25,261 --> 00:24:26,639
and it's gonna be
no‐holds‐barred.

577
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:28,058
It's gonna be wide open.

578
00:24:28,058 --> 00:24:29,603
And, you know,
through that process,

579
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:31,691
hopefully, you know,
comes forward someone

580
00:24:31,691 --> 00:24:34,989
who can win a general election
and take him on.

581
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:36,450
‐ I hope you work
for one of them.

582
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,456
Thank you so much, Steve.

583
00:24:39,456 --> 00:24:41,878
Steve Schmidt, everybody.
All right.

584
00:24:41,878 --> 00:24:45,009
I'm gonna wrap up the show,
and then I'm gonna

585
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:47,430
turn back to you,
and let's do one of those,

586
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,727
like, '80s freeze‐frames,
and then they'll run

587
00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:52,440
the credits with, like,
royalty‐free music over it.

588
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,484
‐ Let's do it.
‐ Okay, ready?

589
00:24:53,484 --> 00:24:55,196
All right, here we go.

590
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:56,949
My thanks to Steve Schmidt,

591
00:24:56,949 --> 00:24:59,329
Milana Vayntrub,
and Lawrence O'Donnell.

592
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:03,212
Good night, America.
I lurve you.
