00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,760
THE CHOSEN ONE

2
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:38,961
Paul, I'm Christine ...

3
00:01:39,662 --> 00:01:40,862
... Listen ...

4
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:43,362
... I'm sorry I hurt.

5
00:01:43,463 --> 00:01:45,363
I never wanted this to happen.

6
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:49,964
How I feel if I were away for
the last two years ...

7
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:56,365
... I love you Paul, but I want
something more in my life.

8
00:01:58,066 --> 00:01:59,266
Bye.

9
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:30,867
Paul, shit!

10
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:36,168
Paul, go, go!

11
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:46,769
By God! Shit!

12
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,670
Curse!

13
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:55,471
Give me that! Give me that!

14
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:04,072
What the hell?

15
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:06,573
No, no, no!

16
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:09,874
Get out of here,
get out of here!

17
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:13,175
Qu est wrong with you?

18
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:23,476
You hate to see you as old.

19
00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:26,977
Look, I s that of Christine
est killing you ...

20
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:29,578
... But you have to get
over, she's gone, man.

21
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,079
You can not let a bad experience
derail your whole life.

22
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,480
She left me for a
yoga instructor.

23
00:03:42,481 --> 00:03:44,481
ramos partners ...

24
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,482
... Tenamos a life plan ...

25
00:03:46,883 --> 00:03:49,183
... Has thrown down the toilet.

26
00:03:50,684 --> 00:03:51,984
It's my fault.

27
00:03:52,785 --> 00:03:53,785
Look ...

28
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:54,886
... You know, wait!

29
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:56,787
Stop, stop that!

30
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,588
T did not you go,
she did, right?

31
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,750
What you have to do is find
someone more, and move on.

32
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,390
S not how to do that.

33
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:15,091
NISSAN POWER

34
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:39,992
Buenos das, Paul.

35
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:41,893
What did you do last night?

36
00:04:42,294 --> 00:04:44,294
Trying to burn my house.

37
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:46,895
Forgiveness, what did you say?

38
00:04:50,696 --> 00:04:53,196
Congratulations, you just
made a big deal.

39
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:05,297
Paul, I can talk to you?

40
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:22,598
As you know, Paul ...

41
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:25,690
... We are the Nissan dealer
number four in the pas ...

42
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,300
... And number two in the state.

43
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:29,901
Y t helped to llegramos ah.

44
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:33,802
Last year you were the best Nissan
dealer in California ...

45
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:36,403
... But have not made a single
sale in three months.

46
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:42,204
Now, s you have problems, Paul,
we all have problems.

47
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:46,205
Hell, the dog Manuel will pas
a truck of garbage on top.

48
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,206
l was here very early
the following day.

49
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:52,607
I sold a maximum and
a SUV before noon.

50
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:55,808
I'm still motivated, Bob?

51
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,809
Is that what you are
going on right now?

52
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,110
See, s to ESTs having trouble
in your marriage.

53
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,811
I have no problem ...

54
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:04,512
... She is gone.

55
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:09,513
T know, some of the guys have been
talking about a revision ...

56
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:11,814
... Say that last year was
only a coincidence.

57
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:13,015
Really?

58
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:15,716
All I'm saying is that
shit happens.

59
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:20,217
Some give you the windshield,
others give you the bug.

60
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:22,618
And today I'm an insect?

61
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:30,519
Bob, ESTs being totally
wasted here ...

62
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,520
... Because this is simply gold.

63
00:06:33,721 --> 00:06:38,821
Friend, strongly suggest
you know what?

64
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:40,522
You go home ...

65
00:06:40,523 --> 00:06:44,623
... You shower, shave, you
put some clean clothes ...

66
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:48,050
... And you work really hard to
get you the head of the ass ...

67
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:50,851
... Because you're tucked
deep inside ah Paul.

68
00:06:50,852 --> 00:06:53,052
Y est starting to affect
people around you ...

69
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:56,153
... Like me and do not
need this shit!

70
00:06:56,754 --> 00:06:59,054
Is that the new Nissan
Armada V8?

71
00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:01,255
It is a hybrid, right?

72
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,856
As is.

73
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,857
There are only two in
the entire country.

74
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:09,358
They have one in Michigan,
and we have the other.

75
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:13,959
At Nissan of Bill Smith almost shit
when you get it, and they do not.

76
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,560
It's a very nice car.

77
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:19,861
That baby is going to be the star of
the presentation of cars on Friday.

78
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:22,262
Hello!

79
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:25,463
Hello Señoritas at a time
when I'm with you.

80
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:31,864
I have to talk to
these girls ...

81
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:35,665
... Will be working for
us in the presentation.

82
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:44,766
They look spectacular,
this is fabulous ...

83
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,667
... I love those costumes
are very colorful.

84
00:07:46,768 --> 00:07:52,168
May only be turned into a spin
to see how the sarong?

85
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:57,169
And there is nothing wrong with them, as that,
because they do without the sarong?

86
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,570
This is beautiful, and
only turn to BC for m.

87
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:04,971
It's beautiful, I like
the colors, not bad.

88
00:08:06,872 --> 00:08:09,872
Hey Paul, do not touch that car!

89
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,073
Paul!

90
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:12,474
Perdnenme, Señoritas.

91
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:15,875
Paul, Paul, do not you
step on that car!

92
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:18,776
Get out of that car!
Open that door!

93
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:21,577
Damn it, Paul, opened the door!

94
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:25,478
I tell you, I have had enough already
or enough of this shit.

95
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:28,579
Get out of that car!
I have to spell it for you?

96
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,980
Damn!, You can get out of this -

97
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,081
Wipers off these, do not
mess with the radio!

98
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:39,382
And if you look down action,
sir, is 6.9%.

99
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,283
I say this, fired
ESTs, ESTs fired!

100
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:44,284
Do not turn the fly!

101
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:45,885
That devils being
wrong with you?

102
00:08:50,086 --> 00:08:55,686
I tell you, never work on a Nissan
volversa in this city!

103
00:08:57,783 --> 00:09:00,283
By God, you've lost your mind?

104
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:08,684
Damn!

105
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:38,685
Son of a bitch!

106
00:10:49,386 --> 00:10:50,486
Hello.

107
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:55,287
We come from the Sierra
Nevada of Santa Marta.

108
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,888
We are very honored to meet you.

109
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:02,589
Estn you in some sort of
charity or something?

110
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,790
This man is our holy
chamn Arawak.

111
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:11,391
We have traveled many miles, and
crossed many rivers to meet him.

112
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:15,892
Look, I'm in the middle of
something, at this time.

113
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:22,093
Here ...

114
00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:28,994
... This is only here,

115
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:32,195
Tmenlo all ...

00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:35,896
... And good luck with that.

117
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:02,697
Hello.

118
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:06,498
Paul, thank God ah ESTs.
I tried to call you.

119
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:10,050
Paul, I knew your brother
Neal as ESTs happening.

120
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,400
Mam, I'm in the middle of
something right now.

121
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:14,501
Well, we want to see you, Paul.

122
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,402
I can call you later, mom?

123
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,003
But Paul, they never
return my calls.

124
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:21,304
I call.

125
00:12:21,805 --> 00:12:22,805
Paul -

126
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:39,806
Come on, come to BC, I want
you to see for yourself.

127
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:45,207
I love these bums out
of our neighborhood.

128
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:52,808
Is l, Zadzig, is the
man he calls them.

129
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:55,109
First pass on my mailbox,
and then has ...

130
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,710
... Homeless people camping
in their front yard.

131
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:59,611
I'll take charge now, sir Danis.

132
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,612
Get out of here!
How do I sell my home?

133
00:13:02,913 --> 00:13:04,813
It seems that we are the
problem, officer.

134
00:13:05,614 --> 00:13:07,614
Hit the mailbox of this man?

135
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:10,915
I honestly do not remember.

136
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,016
Liar!

137
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:15,417
I saw it all, look at your car.

138
00:13:19,218 --> 00:13:20,518
Is this your car sir?

139
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:24,619
Is the distributor
for that job ...

140
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,020
... Worked.

141
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:30,021
It always happens with your car over your
neighbor's mailbox on the way home?

142
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:32,522
Not always, no.

143
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:34,523
Know these people?

144
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:43,824
S. ..

145
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,525
... Are my friends.

146
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:54,426
That's Jim Jones and Curly, s.

147
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:58,027
Let's go now.

148
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:02,128
Thanks, I take care of that.

149
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:07,229
Go home for a drink, Jim,
bring your friends.

150
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,330
I like your hat.

151
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:11,531
They will not do anything?

152
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:14,332
Estn on private property, there
is nothing we can do.

153
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,133
Come guys ...

154
00:14:20,134 --> 00:14:22,534
... Do not worry about my
neighbor is a real idiot.

155
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:25,135
I can offer something ...

156
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:28,336
... A beer, water, juice?

157
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:30,637
S not if you have any of those.

158
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:32,638
Water to be fine, thanks.

159
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,639
S?

160
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,140
Of where they say
they are, again?

161
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:41,741
In the Sierra Nevada
of Santa Marta.

162
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:46,042
Where is it, exactly?

163
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:48,243
In the mountains of tropical
forests in Colombia.

164
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:49,744
Colombia?

165
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:53,245
Colombia, South America?

166
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:58,446
Well ...

... Brings to ac qu?

168
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:06,248
These are holy men of
the Arawak tribe.

00:15:07,849 --> 00:15:10,649

- Arawak.

170
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,650
He is the spiritual leader ...

171
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:14,451
... The Mama.

172
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:17,252
l is the mom?

173
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:21,853
Have been guided to your door by
the spirit of their ancestors.

174
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:23,954
My door?

175
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:26,455
At 2254 Avenue Roslin?

176
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:31,856
What are making?

177
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:34,157
It is a blessing.

00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:36,258
A ritual of purification.

179
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,059
They believe they are the
keepers of the world.

180
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,760
Have lived in the rainforest, under
the shadow of the great spirit ...

181
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:48,261
... Of the mountain, for
thousands of years.

182
00:15:48,962 --> 00:15:50,362
From the beginning of time ...

183
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:53,063
... There has been snow on
top of that mountain.

184
00:15:53,964 --> 00:15:54,964
But ...

185
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:58,065
... Now the snow has melted.

186
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:01,166
Sorry to hear that.

187
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:04,067
The Arawak believe that if
the mountain dies ...

188
00:16:04,868 --> 00:16:07,268
... The world suffer
the same fate.

189
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,369
I do not understand that
has to do with me.

190
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,670
They believe that you
are saving it.

191
00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:18,871
Qu?

192
00:16:20,872 --> 00:16:22,572
I am a car salesman ...

193
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:25,673
... To be honest, I'm not
even that anymore.

194
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:36,074
He said?

195
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:40,575
He said his former spirits have
great blessing on them.

196
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:45,176
Because you, is really
the choice.

197
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:18,177
Okay, you can stay tonight ...

198
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:22,478
... And tomorrow I take them
to the bus station ...

199
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,779
... And take it to go wherever
I need to go.

200
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,380
Thanks.

201
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:35,681
Must be hungry, right?

202
00:17:37,582 --> 00:17:38,582
No s. ..

203
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,683
... I have.

204
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:42,284
See if I can prepare something.

205
00:18:02,985 --> 00:18:04,285
It's turkey.

206
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:11,086
How long are going to be as?

207
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:14,487
Not s.

208
00:18:18,288 --> 00:18:19,288
Hi man!

209
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:21,089
It was quite a stake
that you got today.

210
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,290
Yes, sorry.

211
00:18:25,991 --> 00:18:28,591
- However much you love me?
- Qu?

212
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,392
I fixed it.

213
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:31,693
What fixed it?

214
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:33,794
Your job, you idiot!

215
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:37,695
Bob wanted to say goodbye and make
arrest, now can not do anything.

216
00:18:38,096 --> 00:18:40,196
All that happened is that the windows
of the room exhibicin broken ...

217
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,797
... WILL BE deducted from your
commissions. That's all.

218
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,998
I need the car keys.

219
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:51,599
Take the car to the workshop, I
fully arranged for Saturday.

220
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Done.

221
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:54,001
I told Bob ...

222
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:57,102
... If Paul goes, we go all.

223
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,103
- Really?
- No.

224
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:01,804
Of course not.
What are you, moron?

225
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:05,005
You're really lucky that
Nakamori want your ass.

226
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:08,606
He told Bob he was very excited to
see your best salesperson working.

227
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:11,807
Bob saw the phone with Nakamori,
seriously ...

228
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:14,308
... I think that really is cag.

229
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:16,209
Knows he can not kick you out.

230
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,610
Do not put me through?

231
00:19:18,711 --> 00:19:21,911
- I have someone here.
- Ah got a girl inside?

232
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,712
Well, you've been hiding me!

233
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:25,513
Hey, respect ...

234
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,314
... Revenge sex is the memory
of you will not get tired.

235
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:29,915
It is ace.

236
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,916
Llmame only if you
need any help.

237
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:34,117
- Be well.
- I meant to her.

238
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:40,518
Okay, see you after.

239
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:26,519
As will be well?

240
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
I can bring a blanket
or something?

241
00:20:35,721 --> 00:20:36,921
Estn well.

242
00:20:44,822 --> 00:20:46,322
You must be tired.

243
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:49,023
Let me show you where the
room or est of guests.

244
00:20:49,024 --> 00:20:51,624
I apologize, I'm not used
to having company.

245
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:05,425
Sorry, not even s your name.

246
00:21:05,826 --> 00:21:08,526
Marisa, Marisa Orcs Daz.

247
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:14,127
I'm Paul, Paul Zadzig.

248
00:21:18,828 --> 00:21:20,828
You're a acucaca too?

249
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:23,629
Arawak.

250
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,930
Arhuaca.

251
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,330
No. No, I'm from Bogota.

252
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:30,931
One working for the government
of Colombia ...

253
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:34,032
... To help people assimilate
into our society Arawak.

254
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:37,633
Wow, that's very
admirable of you.

255
00:21:37,934 --> 00:21:39,200
S, well ...

256
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:43,301
... Instead of assimilating
them, they assimilated me.

257
00:21:59,102 --> 00:22:01,302
Est the bathroom just
across the aisle ...

258
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:03,203
... Leave a light on for you.

259
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:04,950
It was very nice.

260
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:09,751
You know? wait a second.

261
00:22:25,452 --> 00:22:27,052
This should stay.

262
00:22:29,553 --> 00:22:30,653
Thanks.

263
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,854
Well, good night.

264
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:39,855
Good night.

265
00:23:13,856 --> 00:23:16,256
You have a voice.

266
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:18,757
Paul, I'm Christine ...

267
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,250
... Listen ...

268
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:23,159
... I'm sorry I hurt ...

269
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,960
... I never wanted
this to happen.

270
00:23:25,761 --> 00:23:28,961
How I feel if I were away
for the last two years.

271
00:24:19,162 --> 00:24:22,962
I hope you do not mind,
I made some coffee.

272
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:27,363
Not for nothing, knew she had.

273
00:24:30,964 --> 00:24:32,464
These guys are amazing.

274
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:34,265
S.

275
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:41,366
I did something to this plant?

276
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:43,467
No.

277
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,568
- Empty the tequila?
- No.

278
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:14,469
Look, I've been good ...

279
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,670
... But this is not well.

280
00:25:17,071 --> 00:25:21,971
These shots were we.
This tequila bottle
cost me 30 dollars.

281
00:25:22,572 --> 00:25:23,972
Now I have to go out
and get another ...

282
00:25:24,173 --> 00:25:25,773
... You should not
have to do that.

283
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:30,974
Also I need back
my credit cards.

284
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:39,075
The Arawak do not need money.

285
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:45,476
Well, I realize that in this
country is quite useful.

286
00:25:54,377 --> 00:25:56,177
Who are these people?

287
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,078
These people are the last of the
pre-Columbian civilization.

288
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,879
They have never known war ...

289
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,780
... Never been conquered ...

290
00:26:15,581 --> 00:26:17,581
... Never felt threatened.

291
00:26:17,582 --> 00:26:20,782
Up a secret path of
1300 steps ...

292
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:23,183
... To the top of an
inaccessible mountain.

293
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:26,884
His sense of time is
different from ours.

294
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:31,785
They speak of the conquerors
like it was yesterday.

295
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:39,586
They believe they have been secretly watching
the world for thousands of years.

296
00:26:41,787 --> 00:26:43,987
They believe that what
is important ...

297
00:26:45,588 --> 00:26:49,788
... Is not what can be seen, but
what connects all things.

298
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:59,689
Forgiveness is a little early
so you can understand that.

299
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,890
So you're saying I do not judos?

300
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:10,891
God did not see you
ah, das good.

301
00:27:13,392 --> 00:27:16,992
Cared about, guys, tell me
why they threw my alcohol?

302
00:27:22,493 --> 00:27:25,893
The head should be clear to receive
the message from the heart.

303
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:29,494
Well, tell your foot is going to go
in the ass if they do it again.

304
00:27:31,795 --> 00:27:33,895
No, do not translate that.

305
00:27:38,696 --> 00:27:39,896
They are doing?

306
00:27:40,597 --> 00:27:43,797
It is a combination of marine
snails and coca leaves ...

307
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:46,998
... The relaxed, when they
feel anxious or nervous.

308
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,399
Coca leaves?

309
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,600
Recurdame not pass through customs
at the airport with these guys.

310
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:57,601
Tell them you do not
have to be nervous.

311
00:28:06,302 --> 00:28:07,502
What say?

312
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:11,803
He said you do not want to be
the one to save them, sorry.

313
00:28:15,004 --> 00:28:18,604
Marisa, You are an educated
person ...

314
00:28:18,605 --> 00:28:22,205
... You have to explain that
I am not who they believe.

315
00:28:22,406 --> 00:28:24,206
I can not save anyone ...

316
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:26,007
... I can not even save myself.

317
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:29,408
But do not get me wrong,
I'm flattered.

318
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:34,609
The Arawak not have the word
flattery on her tongue.

319
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,410
I wonder if they have the word
delusional in their language.

320
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:41,511
Do not translate that!

321
00:28:46,412 --> 00:28:47,612
Let's get something to eat.

322
00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:50,413
Kids want to eat? Food, food.

323
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:54,614
Put the leaves of coca away ...

324
00:28:54,615 --> 00:28:55,915
... And we eat, we go.

325
00:28:57,316 --> 00:28:59,516
How is that came up
here from Colombia?

326
00:28:59,717 --> 00:29:00,717
Walk.

327
00:29:01,118 --> 00:29:02,118
Walked?

328
00:29:02,219 --> 00:29:04,419
Sometimes we cross rivers
by swimming.

329
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,220
What about the office, how is
that crossed the border?

330
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:10,921
That is why some times we
crossed rivers to swim.

331
00:29:12,622 --> 00:29:15,022
As who are in the country
illegally?

332
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:19,823
Well, welcome to Los Angeles, half the
people in this town are illegal.

333
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:22,824
Encajarn perfectly.

334
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:26,925
Except for hats.

335
00:29:50,126 --> 00:29:51,326
What say?

336
00:29:51,827 --> 00:29:55,327
We are very fortunate to be here
the day of the great harvest.

337
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:59,028
It's like da harvest every
day, in this place.

338
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,829
Sorry, you will pay for it?

339
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,530
Sorry, l think the pear

340
00:30:45,631 --> 00:30:49,931
Great, is a very nice seed,
but prefer an bank money.

341
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:51,532
You have to pay for it.

342
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:56,133
Sorry, estn me, I will make
it over to the exit.

343
00:30:56,334 --> 00:30:58,534
Well, thanks.

344
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:04,435
Please Djelid, l think that
bought it honestly.

345
00:31:08,736 --> 00:31:09,736
Okay.

346
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:17,737
He wants to make a trade
for the apple.

347
00:31:18,338 --> 00:31:20,938
There is a trade,
only can get it.

348
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:26,039
They like making deals.

349
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
Okay ...

350
00:31:30,201 --> 00:31:32,801
... But it will cost
three seeds.

351
00:31:35,802 --> 00:31:36,802
A?

352
00:31:38,303 --> 00:31:41,403
Tell him that I was the number
one in sales last year.

353
00:31:43,704 --> 00:31:45,104
Three seeds.

354
00:31:51,905 --> 00:31:53,105
Two?

355
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:58,106
Well, two seed ...

356
00:31:58,107 --> 00:32:00,507

s fucking est.

357
00:32:02,008 --> 00:32:03,808
Do not translate that.

358
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:07,400
Very good, congratulations, you
just get a great deal ...

359
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,310
... And a new block of luxury.

360
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:17,711
And I get them.

361
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:31,012
There are fruits, vegetables and
other things for you guys.

362
00:32:31,213 --> 00:32:34,513
There are also cans of tuna, a
can opener, and some water.

363
00:32:34,714 --> 00:32:37,914
Thanks, has been more
than generous.

364
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,315
Well, I feel bad that you have
come this far for nothing ...

365
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:45,216
... Wanted to be the guy
they want, but I'm not.

366
00:32:58,417 --> 00:33:00,717
Do not judge so harshly ...

367
00:33:01,318 --> 00:33:05,318
... No forgiveness for us,
we love nothing more.

368
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,719
Try to remember that.

369
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,920
He says it's a very good apple.

370
00:33:22,021 --> 00:33:24,421
Hope you have snow on
the mountain soon.

371
00:34:23,922 --> 00:34:26,522
Vamos! Do not do that.

372
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:40,123
Hello!

373
00:34:40,524 --> 00:34:44,324
Hi Paulie, it is impossible
to have you on hold.

374
00:34:45,025 --> 00:34:47,125
Hi mam, hi Neal.

375
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:50,426
Narandamundi cool is that you
could come from Colorado?

376
00:34:50,427 --> 00:34:51,427
S.

377
00:34:51,727 --> 00:34:52,827
It was fate.

378
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,128
Vavanasalomi decided to make his trip
to India just when mom calls.

379
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:00,529
Pens that will be the ideal time
to visit my another family.

380
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,030
Good to see you again, Neal.

381
00:35:03,431 --> 00:35:05,631
How are things at the monastery?

382
00:35:05,832 --> 00:35:06,832
Quiet.

383
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:10,233
My God! What it happened here?

384
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:16,134
I bought one of those sparkling logs, I think
that sparkle more than you estimated.

385
00:35:16,735 --> 00:35:20,035
Paul, you can be dead!

386
00:35:22,736 --> 00:35:24,936
I hope not drinking again ESTs.

387
00:35:25,137 --> 00:35:27,837
Mother talked about
this in the way ...

388
00:35:27,938 --> 00:35:30,538
... We were not to confront
Paul about his alcoholism.

389
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,339
Thanks for not mentioning it.

390
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,240
Who has been caring
for your plants?

391
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:43,041
Wish that more would do this.

392
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:45,142
What you give?

393
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,143
Ms sun, I think.

394
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,444
Mam, you can give your plants more sun
burning your curtains only as Paul.

395
00:35:55,145 --> 00:35:56,945
I can offer you a t?

396
00:35:57,746 --> 00:35:58,946
Orgnic ...

397
00:35:59,047 --> 00:36:00,347
... If you have it.

398
00:36:40,148 --> 00:36:42,248
What do you think the
new apartment, Mom?

399
00:36:43,749 --> 00:36:47,749
Is small, but nice, I do
not need much space.

400
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,850
You miss home?

401
00:37:03,951 --> 00:37:06,351
Remember that the
shoulder injury -

402
00:37:14,152 --> 00:37:16,752
Remember that the shoulder injury
I have from my school?

403
00:37:17,953 --> 00:37:19,553
It does not hurt.

404
00:37:20,354 --> 00:37:22,154
Wow, that's good news.

405
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:24,555
For the first time
in twenty years.

406
00:37:29,256 --> 00:37:32,756
Not if decrtelo must, but
call me Christine.

407
00:37:34,957 --> 00:37:36,357
What say?

408
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:40,758
I wanted to know how I
was in my new home.

409
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,559
Keep an instructor
of yoga with that?

410
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,960
Qu?

411
00:37:50,961 --> 00:37:52,461
She did not mention.

412
00:37:55,162 --> 00:37:56,362
Neal!

413
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:10,563
Thanks for the soup, mam.

414
00:38:11,064 --> 00:38:12,864
I'm glad you liked it.

415
00:38:16,065 --> 00:38:17,865
Do not you want some, Neal?

416
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:22,266
Hello mam!
T know I'm vegetarian.

417
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,367
But you always liked
my chicken soup.

418
00:38:26,068 --> 00:38:28,468
I've been a vegan
for eight years.

419
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:32,669
Bean I forgot how much we enjoy
eating vegetables ...

420
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,070
Isolate with men ...
and strangers for weeks
without end.

421
00:38:37,371 --> 00:38:38,971
Here we go.

422
00:38:38,972 --> 00:38:41,872
Look at your watch mam, as time passed
before the first comment homofbico?

423
00:38:41,973 --> 00:38:43,373
Guys, please.

424
00:38:44,974 --> 00:38:49,374
L I am a Buddhist, you're
a car dealer.

425
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:53,875
The Buddhist, Buddhist
quin did you?

426
00:38:54,176 --> 00:38:57,476
I spend my days looking
for lighting ...

427
00:38:57,977 --> 00:39:01,177
... Trying to create more
compassion in the world.

428
00:39:01,978 --> 00:39:06,178
Not like t, you spend your das
trying to fool the people.

429
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:09,479
Okay, first let's make
something clear ...

430
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,180
... I do not engaoa people ...

431
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:14,181
... And second, I have nothing
against gay people in s. ..

432
00:39:14,182 --> 00:39:17,582
... Only the bitter, who use their
supposed spirituality ...

433
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:22,083
... Like a hammer to hit people who
believe spiritual inferiors.

434
00:39:22,184 --> 00:39:24,684
I'm over your little ones
and petty jealousy.

435
00:39:24,685 --> 00:39:28,585
Detnganse!
I will not tolerate this more
than they did his father.

436
00:39:28,786 --> 00:39:31,786
How many times did he say?
The family first.

437
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,087
That's why he committed suicide?

438
00:39:38,888 --> 00:39:40,688
They do not want to
talk about it?

439
00:39:41,689 --> 00:39:43,689
Of course not, sorry.

440
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,190
I go.

441
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:08,791
If you touch the bell again, I'm going
to get very deep in the ass.

442
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:12,592
Well, how much anger.

443
00:40:12,893 --> 00:40:13,993
Do it!

444
00:40:15,094 --> 00:40:17,294
There are strange people
in the door.

445
00:40:22,195 --> 00:40:24,695
Hey!
Children, lost their autobs?

446
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:27,696
Spend, spend, spend!

447
00:40:29,397 --> 00:40:30,797
Meet my family.

448
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:35,898
Know these people?

449
00:40:36,499 --> 00:40:40,999
S, she is Marisa, and they
are the avocados.

450
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,500
- Arawaks.
- Arcuacos, forgiveness.

451
00:40:44,701 --> 00:40:46,101
They are from South America.

452
00:40:46,702 --> 00:40:48,202
l is the mom.

453
00:40:51,403 --> 00:40:52,803
Is mam?

454
00:40:53,304 --> 00:40:54,904
Nice to meet you.

455
00:40:55,605 --> 00:40:57,505
They are shamans, Colombia.

456
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,806
This is incredible!

457
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:04,607
This is my brother Neal ...

458
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,708
... And that's my mom.

459
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:13,909
My spiritual name is Narandamundi,
my brother can not pronounce it.

460
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:26,010
It's a great honor to meet the mother
and brother of the Chosen.

461
00:41:28,711 --> 00:41:30,111
Chosen?

462
00:41:32,912 --> 00:41:35,412
Come guys, we have soup.

463
00:41:35,413 --> 00:41:37,013
Come, come.

464
00:41:48,313 --> 00:41:51,913
- Qu shamans are tribe?
- Arawak.

465
00:41:52,714 --> 00:41:56,914
I do not know.
Estn yanimanis connected to?

466
00:42:02,515 --> 00:42:04,715
Do not know the people
you speak of ...

467
00:42:04,716 --> 00:42:07,716
... But the Arawak estn connected
to all living things.

468
00:42:08,717 --> 00:42:13,117
Well, I studied with the great
chamn yanimani Aranangaragi.

469
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:14,818
You know him?

470
00:42:22,419 --> 00:42:26,619
Really?
Everyone in South America
Aranangaragi know.

471
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,320
Interesting.

472
00:42:29,221 --> 00:42:31,921
By the way, they realize that
there is meat in the soup?

473
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:33,922
S.

474
00:42:34,723 --> 00:42:38,023
For all the shamans
I know are vegans.

475
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:43,224
The supreme being knows that eating
meat blocks their spiritual path.

476
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:46,925
They can eat whatever they want,
not everyone has to be like t.

477
00:42:47,126 --> 00:42:50,526
Well, they are vegetarian ...

478
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:53,627
... But believe to be more
Daino for their bodies ...

479
00:42:53,628 --> 00:42:55,028
... Insulting his anfitrin ...

480
00:42:55,029 --> 00:42:57,229
... To eat what was prepared.

481
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:02,530
That is a lovely custom, most
people should be like you.

482
00:43:02,731 --> 00:43:05,231
Okay, we went back a bit? ...

483
00:43:05,532 --> 00:43:10,432
... I'm an confused about how my brother
is one of the chosen people?

484
00:43:11,233 --> 00:43:17,133
No chosen people, chosen.
I am the chosen, not t,
not Marindemongi, yo.

485
00:43:17,934 --> 00:43:21,134
Really?
And how is that selected
the chosen?

486
00:43:21,135 --> 00:43:23,935
How it works, use a
alcoholmetro test?

487
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:26,236
Come on, Paul, these people
are a deception.

488
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,237
You are in a very vulnerable state,
and estn taking advantage of it.

489
00:43:29,238 --> 00:43:32,238
Hey Neal Maringimingi tell
you shut your mouth!

490
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:34,739
Where to estn quedndose
friends ...

491
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:38,340
... Have family near here?

492
00:43:38,341 --> 00:43:39,741
They stay with me.

493
00:43:41,042 --> 00:43:43,442
How much money you
have taken so far?

494
00:43:44,843 --> 00:43:47,243
See mom?
I tena reason, we estn
removing their money.

495
00:43:47,244 --> 00:43:50,244
We do not want to cause problems with your family.
Bye.

496
00:43:50,745 --> 00:43:52,940
You stay. Sintense!

497
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:56,046
Paul, you never know what
you do, this is crazy.

498
00:43:56,047 --> 00:43:59,047
- These are my huspedes.
- But we are your family.

499
00:43:59,048 --> 00:44:00,348
Neal, carried home mom.

500
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:02,649
Give me that thing -

501
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:10,050
We mam, we are not welcome here.

502
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:17,851
There is a difference between
chamn and thief.

503
00:46:13,052 --> 00:46:14,252
Marisa?

504
00:46:28,053 --> 00:46:29,053
What is going on?

505
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,554
Estn facing the mountain
in the Sierra Nevada.

506
00:46:35,955 --> 00:46:37,755
Why do that?

507
00:46:38,656 --> 00:46:40,656
Estn praying for her.

508
00:46:45,157 --> 00:46:48,357
Well, I'm back on
planet Earth now?

509
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:53,158
I have to go to work,
but there ...

510
00:46:54,259 --> 00:46:57,859
... No food in the refrigerator.

511
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,260
What say?

512
00:47:21,261 --> 00:47:23,461
Each morning we are
born again ...

513
00:47:24,462 --> 00:47:27,262
... But what we do today
is what matters most.

514
00:47:30,863 --> 00:47:33,063
If you want to watch TV ...

515
00:47:33,764 --> 00:47:35,564
... This is the remote control.

516
00:47:36,365 --> 00:47:39,965
Only press the red button,
and voila ...

517
00:47:40,266 --> 00:47:42,066
... The TV lights.

518
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:48,267
Here, right?

519
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,468

You may think to ATRS ...

620
00:55:06,175 --> 00:55:09,551
... When they really wanted to
do something with your life?

621
00:55:11,852 --> 00:55:13,352
To be honest ...

622
00:55:14,053 --> 00:55:16,453
... I do not think I ever
had that moment.

623
00:55:18,954 --> 00:55:22,754
If you see deep in your heart, you
can see who is having the time ...

624
00:55:22,955 --> 00:55:24,355
... Right now.

625
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:29,956

00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,200
And he finds it satisfactory?

629
00:55:39,201 --> 00:55:41,970
S, my wife left me ...

630
00:55:42,071 --> 00:55:45,200
... My boss wants to say goodbye, and
two days ago, almost melt my house.

631
00:55:45,272 --> 00:55:47,472
Est seems working pretty well.

632
00:55:49,173 --> 00:55:50,750
This is the Cuban salsa ...

633
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:54,151
... Is to have the flat stomach,
and abdominal laundry.

634
00:55:54,252 --> 00:55:56,752
But do not be deceived
by all this fun ...

635
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:59,753
... The buzz is so effective that
tried to burn calories est ...

636
00:55:59,754 --> 00:56:01,154
... A cup over a thousand -

637
00:56:23,555 --> 00:56:26,255
I did not order that
channel, I swear.

638
00:56:26,956 --> 00:56:28,856
It's like a trial period ...

639
00:56:28,857 --> 00:56:31,200
... They'll take it for
a couple of months.

640
00:56:31,701 --> 00:56:32,901
Really.

641
00:56:34,302 --> 00:56:36,902
Porn, not me.

642
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,760
Why not listen to some music?

643
00:56:52,861 --> 00:56:54,861
Is Fairport Convention.

644
00:56:55,962 --> 00:56:57,962
It is one of my favorites.

645
00:57:03,863 --> 00:57:05,263
It's nice.

646
00:57:07,864 --> 00:57:11,064
In fact you only listen
to while dancing.

647
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,300
- One of the rules.
- Is as?

648
00:57:43,301 --> 00:57:48,301
Will offer you a drink, but they
found my last dotacin arrack.

649
00:57:49,502 --> 00:57:53,502
Was on the roof.
It seemed like a good hiding.

650
00:57:54,303 --> 00:57:55,903
They are very good.

651
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:04,300
No need to talk with you or
what your heart has to say.

652
00:58:06,601 --> 00:58:10,001
Estn saying that
the Arawaks, ot?

653
00:58:19,802 --> 00:58:22,202

00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:40,099
Dganme qu is going on.

00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,700
I know what happens,
and I know now!

656
00:59:42,701 --> 00:59:43,701
What happens?

00:59:45,602 --> 00:59:48,102
- Wait.
- Dganme now!

659
00:59:50,603 --> 00:59:52,903
It is time for the
selected wake up.

660
00:59:53,004 --> 00:59:56,704
I'm not chosen, I am nothing!

661
00:59:56,705 --> 00:59:58,905
I believe in nothing!

662
01:00:04,806 --> 01:00:09,006
It is more important to
have faith to believe.

663
01:00:09,007 --> 01:00:11,007
But I have not much faith.

664
01:00:17,008 --> 01:00:18,608
That's why we pray.

665
01:00:22,809 --> 01:00:27,409
I'm not God, I can not make
snow on your mountain.

666
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:28,810
Hey, hey!

667
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,511
I hope you do not mind,
guest myself.

668
01:00:32,112 --> 01:00:33,312
What is going on?

669
01:00:33,413 --> 01:00:36,113
The Umpa Lumpa estn
having a party.

670
01:00:37,214 --> 01:00:38,814
What are you doing up so early?

671
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:41,015
On my way to the airport
to pick up Nakamori ...

672
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:43,116
... Comes today, no one
else knows. Remember?

673
01:00:43,217 --> 01:00:46,117
Want to go out and have some fun
before his wife comes to town.

674
01:00:46,118 --> 01:00:48,118
And call in sick to both.

675
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:49,819
Not if I keep this up.

676
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,820
What do you mean you
do not want to go?

677
01:00:53,021 --> 01:00:54,821
We worked six years
for this day ...

678
01:00:54,822 --> 01:00:58,522
... This is not going to let you spoil
it by sleeping with Pocahontas.

679
01:00:58,523 --> 01:01:01,023
- I'm not sleeping with anyone.
- Hey, that's an even worse!

680
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:02,624
I do not understand ...

681
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:03,825
... Quin these people?

682
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,026
How can you let come
into our lives ...

683
01:01:05,027 --> 01:01:06,700
... And ruin everything
we've worked?

684
01:01:06,728 --> 01:01:09,928
- Do not try to sell now.
- Well, Christine is
an about, right?

685
01:01:10,729 --> 01:01:12,529
You have to keep working ...

686
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:13,830
... Is what we are.

687
01:01:14,731 --> 01:01:16,931
Now, tonight we will show
Nakamori some fun ...

688
01:01:16,932 --> 01:01:18,032
... And some women easy.

689

01:01:21,534 --> 01:01:23,134
... And we are inside.

691

694
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:32,438
Help a brother out!

695
01:01:40,439 --> 01:01:45,139
There can be only a coincidence, there
must be some kind of explanation.

696
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,840
Afraid?

697
01:01:49,441 --> 01:01:50,641
Fear of what?

698
01:01:50,842 --> 01:01:54,042
In this world there are mysteries
that can not understand.

699
01:01:55,043 --> 01:01:57,343
That's not the same person
I was yesterday.

700
01:01:58,144 --> 01:02:00,744
Do not want to be the same
person I was yesterday.

701
01:02:06,545 --> 01:02:07,545
Hello.

702
01:02:17,446 --> 01:02:18,646
What happens?

703
01:02:18,847 --> 01:02:21,847
I came to pick up some of my stuff,
and mam ah est inside.

704
01:02:38,248 --> 01:02:39,848
How about in here, Mom?

705
01:02:40,649 --> 01:02:41,849
Hi Paul.

706
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:44,050
I see that you're sitting
in the old seat of pap.

707
01:02:44,851 --> 01:02:47,251
It's too big to fit
in my apartment.

708
01:02:47,752 --> 01:02:50,552
As that Neal says you've
been here for a while.

709
01:02:50,853 --> 01:02:52,853
No, not so long.

710
01:02:53,754 --> 01:02:55,554
Need something?

711
01:02:55,955 --> 01:02:59,555
S, have a coffee latte, maybe a blackberry muffin, y.
..

712
01:02:59,556 --> 01:03:02,856
... If you do not have that, maybe
my third grade books ...

713
01:03:02,857 --> 01:03:05,557
... Or my electric train
from there up.

714
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:14,858
The security guard says she has
three or four times a week ...

715
01:03:14,859 --> 01:03:17,559
... And not leave until close.

716
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:21,660
Hey, Mom!

717
01:03:22,161 --> 01:03:26,761
Perhaps you should consider getting
rid of some of this.

718
01:03:27,962 --> 01:03:30,162
Why? is our life.

719
01:03:30,863 --> 01:03:33,963
The s, but we are not usndolo,
maybe someone more able.

720
01:03:33,964 --> 01:03:39,164
No! This is ours, we
need it, is ours.

721
01:03:39,365 --> 01:03:41,365
Possessions degrade us.

722
01:03:42,366 --> 01:03:44,266
They are an impediment ...

723
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:47,467
... For our transformation to
achieve a high posicinms.

724
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:51,168
Okay mam, Let 's go from here.

725
01:03:51,169 --> 01:03:53,580
- Do not you guys go, I'm fine.
- Mom, come on!

726
01:03:53,581 --> 01:03:55,581
Everything is fine.

727
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:57,382
All is not well!

728
01:03:57,383 --> 01:04:00,783
T ESTs not good, I'm not well,
and he definitely is not well.

729
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:03,784
Wait, do not interpret my life!

730
01:04:03,885 --> 01:04:07,285
Let's stop pretending that everything
is fine, because I do not est.

731
01:04:07,686 --> 01:04:10,986
Only because your father is not
here does not mean that -

732
01:04:10,987 --> 01:04:15,087
Here?
Is not here, you say it like
I was in the room next door.

733
01:04:15,588 --> 01:04:17,388
We can only say?

734
01:04:23,389 --> 01:04:25,089
Only because we can not say it?

735
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:26,790
Knew not what he was doing.

736
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:31,391
Why not tell us what
happened that day?

737
01:04:31,392 --> 01:04:32,692
I do not remember.

738
01:04:32,893 --> 01:04:34,993
Why not share it with me?

739
01:04:35,494 --> 01:04:37,094
It was my dad too.

740
01:04:38,395 --> 01:04:42,695
S sentacmodo not with quin
am, but avoid pruning.

741
01:04:42,696 --> 01:04:44,896
You can not say that
about your father.

742
01:04:45,097 --> 01:04:48,297
We do not talk the last couple
of years he was alive.

743
01:04:48,398 --> 01:04:50,598
I was always trying
to come to l.

744
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:55,299
Wait for that phone call, to come and chat.
Never came.

745
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,400
He was always so easy for you.

746
01:04:59,901 --> 01:05:03,601
Pruning only because hitting a baseball ball, or
going fishing without getting motion sickness.

747
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:06,402
I hated you for it.

748
01:05:09,003 --> 01:05:11,903
T had everything an death.

749
01:05:12,604 --> 01:05:14,104
Even that had.

750
01:05:15,805 --> 01:05:20,205
Why do not I, why could not
commit suicide in my home?

751
01:05:20,606 --> 01:05:22,606
Why could not at least
give me that?

752
01:05:26,607 --> 01:05:28,107
he called me that day ...

753
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:31,508
... I was in the middle
of a business, y. ..

754
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:35,409
... He was upset,
wanted to see me.

755
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:38,510
I sent him home. "

756
01:05:42,411 --> 01:05:47,611
There was this friend who
had for thirty years ...

757
01:05:47,612 --> 01:05:49,612
... And she offered us a ...

758
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:55,413
... Society in the piercing
of oil wells at sea.

759
01:05:56,714 --> 01:06:00,314
We were told it was safe, that there
were no way perdiramos ...

760
01:06:00,315 --> 01:06:03,215
... Made a geological reconnaissance,
and everything.

761
01:06:03,216 --> 01:06:06,516
As we put all our money
for jubilacin ...

762
01:06:07,817 --> 01:06:09,417
... Everything habamos saved.

763
01:06:12,118 --> 01:06:14,318
This is how we lost everything.

764
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:19,019
l I did not want to come to you.

765
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:22,920
I obligu to go, was too proud
to ask for your money.

766
01:06:23,421 --> 01:06:26,421
I did not know that
more pruning to do.

767
01:06:38,522 --> 01:06:39,922
I was drunk ...

768
01:06:43,523 --> 01:06:45,423
... That's why I
do not remember.

769
01:06:45,924 --> 01:06:48,524
He was stinking drunk.

770
01:06:50,825 --> 01:06:52,825
Were forty cars.

771
01:06:53,726 --> 01:06:56,326
It was this small company to hire
that was had been working ...

772
01:06:56,727 --> 01:07:00,127
... And needed a replacement
fleet, a whole fleet ...

773
01:07:00,128 --> 01:07:03,328
... I mean, that's like two years'
wages for many types ...

774
01:07:03,429 --> 01:07:04,929
... But not me.

775
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:10,230
And I tena such ah, and I was about
to close the deal, just ah.

776
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:12,431
Then call pap.

777
01:07:13,132 --> 01:07:15,032
I told him that anger
at a time ...

778
01:07:15,733 --> 01:07:17,333
... And then the type
hesitation ...

779
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:21,134
... See?
that's the thing, you can not give
even a second of respite ...

780
01:07:21,135 --> 01:07:22,735
... Or you lose.

781
01:07:22,736 --> 01:07:26,036
And I was not going to lose this
guy, not going to lose.

782
01:07:26,037 --> 01:07:29,137
As that Friday night, took
him for a drink ...

783
01:07:29,938 --> 01:07:31,738
... And drank.

784
01:07:33,539 --> 01:07:34,939
We drank!

785
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:39,140
And closed the deal.

786
01:07:44,941 --> 01:07:47,341
S not how I arrived home.

787
01:07:57,442 --> 01:07:59,642
I could not see.

788
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:05,500
Saba that something
is wrong, but ...

789
01:08:05,801 --> 01:08:07,601
... I could not see it.

790
01:08:10,302 --> 01:08:12,002
Only me away ...

791
01:08:14,503 --> 01:08:16,703
... And keep walking.

792
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:22,104
Were forty cars.

793
01:08:40,405 --> 01:08:41,605
Hello.

794
01:08:43,006 --> 01:08:44,206
Hello mam.

795
01:08:48,507 --> 01:08:50,707
- What are you?
- S.

796
01:08:55,008 --> 01:08:58,308
- Okay.
- I have it, I repent.

797
01:08:58,908 --> 01:09:02,508
Bring my stuff is very
sweet of you.

798
01:09:02,509 --> 01:09:04,809
We had to hire a removal.

799
01:09:08,709 --> 01:09:12,009
- Well, we have a problem.
- What, what now?

800
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:13,610
Only wait.

801
01:09:14,011 --> 01:09:15,411
- Come on, this heavy est.
- Slo expected.

802
01:09:15,512 --> 01:09:18,312
Neal, your dress is falling est!

803
01:09:18,713 --> 01:09:21,213
Well, you chose to wear
skirts this morning.

804
01:09:22,314 --> 01:09:25,014
Care dear, est edge
under your foot.

805
01:09:25,214 --> 01:09:27,614
Mam, we can not take travs you!
You know?

806
01:09:31,815 --> 01:09:33,015
It's all right.

807
01:09:33,516 --> 01:09:36,316
- It is too narrow to pass.
- Is right.

808
01:09:37,117 --> 01:09:38,917
Going straight, straight behind.

809
01:09:42,318 --> 01:09:44,718
I have no eyes behind your
head, your going.

810
01:09:44,919 --> 01:09:46,919
- Stay to the left.
- Cul left, yours or ma?

811
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,920
Okay, your right, your right.

812
01:09:49,521 --> 01:09:51,221
Think we should go all out?

813
01:09:51,622 --> 01:09:52,922
I take it inside ...

814
01:09:52,923 --> 01:09:54,523
... Or should I eat?

815
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:58,124
As all deliveries at the door,
it's all yours, man.

816
01:09:58,924 --> 01:10:00,524
I can ask you something?

817
01:10:01,125 --> 01:10:02,325
S, of course.

818
01:10:03,126 --> 01:10:05,526
This morning you said that
I was not the same person.

819
01:10:05,527 --> 01:10:07,127
What made you say that?

820
01:10:07,928 --> 01:10:09,728
I see something new.

821
01:10:13,629 --> 01:10:17,529
What we have seen, is one of the
pair of red-tailed hawks ...

822
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:20,230
... Who have been evicted from their
eaves to 12 stories high ...

823
01:10:20,231 --> 01:10:22,731
... In this luxury apartment building,
on Fifth Avenue ...

824
01:10:22,732 --> 01:10:24,232
... Here in New York City.

825
01:10:24,233 --> 01:10:26,933
The hawks have nested on this
site for seven years ...

826
01:10:26,934 --> 01:10:28,134
That is the bird.

827
01:10:28,135 --> 01:10:29,735
Cras ...
and they have every year.

828
01:10:30,436 --> 01:10:32,636
The nest, however,
was withdrawn.

829
01:10:32,637 --> 01:10:37,037
The Administration argues that the
birds were renters dirty ...

830
01:10:37,038 --> 01:10:40,938
... And that their nest had great danger
to the inhabitants of the building ...

831
01:10:40,939 --> 01:10:42,239
... And for pedestrians.

832
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:46,240
Since then there has been a growing
din of protesters ...

833
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:48,541
... Claiming that the nest is
returned to the building.

834
01:10:48,542 --> 01:10:51,542
Was going on when the workers
were destroying the nest ...

835
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:54,743
... And fortunately I was able
to rescue the nest away.

836
01:10:55,344 --> 01:10:57,244
With the breeding season
about to end ...

837
01:10:57,245 --> 01:11:01,245
... The protesters fear that unless the
nest is returned to the building ...

838
01:11:01,646 --> 01:11:04,746
... The Falcons lost the opportunity
to mate this season.

839
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:07,043
That's the same bird
in my dream.

840
01:11:11,044 --> 01:11:12,044
Qu?

841
01:11:13,845 --> 01:11:15,545
Because they are watching me?

842
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:26,546
Want to save this bird?

843
01:11:28,547 --> 01:11:31,847
Is that it?
That's what they want to do?

844
01:11:32,248 --> 01:11:34,448
But how will make it snow
on your mountain?

845
01:11:39,749 --> 01:11:43,049
In the web of life, all
things connected estn.

846
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:46,450
That is until New York.

847
01:11:46,651 --> 01:11:48,651
It is not anything close.

848
01:11:49,152 --> 01:11:51,752
No algnpjaro around
here who can help?

849
01:11:51,953 --> 01:11:54,753
Ms a bird close to this area.

850
01:11:55,254 --> 01:11:57,454
In truth, there are a lot of
bird in the neighborhood ...

851
01:11:57,455 --> 01:11:59,655
... As good as all ...

852
01:11:59,756 --> 01:12:01,156
... Maybe even better.

853
01:12:05,957 --> 01:12:07,957
It has to be that bird, right?

854
01:12:10,758 --> 01:12:15,258
Well then, djenme think for a minute,
and imagine something.

855
01:12:19,259 --> 01:12:21,859
We are grateful to the elected.

856
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:28,260
I did not say it will, only
let me think about it!

857
01:12:30,561 --> 01:12:33,961
Tell them to stop with
that, I think!

858
01:12:36,262 --> 01:12:38,662
This is like the second
time I see you smile.

859
01:12:39,863 --> 01:12:41,263
Disclpenme for a second.

860
01:12:44,164 --> 01:12:45,364
Hello?

861
01:12:45,565 --> 01:12:49,565
Paul, I'm Christine,
we need to talk.

862
01:12:49,566 --> 01:12:51,866
Look, I'm in the coffee
Ahmed in Arvin.

863
01:13:06,867 --> 01:13:08,467
Good to see you.

864
01:13:08,868 --> 01:13:10,268
I bring something to drink?

865
01:13:10,669 --> 01:13:12,169
I drink more coffee.

866
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:13,870
I drink coffee too.

867
01:13:13,871 --> 01:13:16,571
No, wait, are three shots
of tequila, thanks.

868
01:13:16,772 --> 01:13:18,272
Now, because ESTs here?

869
01:13:18,673 --> 01:13:20,873
Paul, s that it has been
difficult for you.

870
01:13:21,774 --> 01:13:23,574
It has been difficult for both.

871
01:13:23,675 --> 01:13:27,175
S? What happens, you do
not like to do yoga?

872
01:13:27,676 --> 01:13:30,976
Well, I deserve that.

873
01:13:31,477 --> 01:13:33,077

Comet error.

876
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,880
Well, I guess everything is to forgive,
take your bags in the car ...

877
01:13:40,881 --> 01:13:42,481
... And move back home.

878
01:13:44,082 --> 01:13:45,282
Paul -

879
01:13:45,283 --> 01:13:48,483
Christine, it was good to see you again,
really, you look very nice ...

880
01:13:48,484 --> 01:13:50,084
... I have to go.

881
01:13:50,485 --> 01:13:52,685
How can you be so cruel?

882
01:13:53,886 --> 01:13:55,286
Forgiveness?

883
01:13:55,287 --> 01:13:56,287
Not understanding that ...

884
01:13:56,588 --> 01:13:58,688
... How I can I be so cruel?

885
01:14:04,889 --> 01:14:06,489
Do yoga with a guy ...

886
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:10,190
... Strips the toilet four years
of marriage, and I'm cruel?

887
01:14:10,791 --> 01:14:12,191
I do not understand that.

888
01:14:14,592 --> 01:14:17,192
Paul, s who hurt you,
and sorry ...

889
01:14:17,193 --> 01:14:19,193
... But I'm coming to you.

890
01:14:19,194 --> 01:14:22,294
All I want to know is if you
give us another chance.

891
01:14:23,095 --> 01:14:24,895
Should not be so hasty.

892
01:14:25,396 --> 01:14:29,996
As you said the yoga instructor seems
like a very interesting person.

893
01:14:34,997 --> 01:14:37,997
I will make this charge
is the least I can do.

01:25:34,516 --> 01:25:35,816
I'm not with them.

981
01:25:37,117 --> 01:25:38,917
Is this the nest in the bag?

982
01:25:39,018 --> 01:25:43,218
Almost all envious of rich people do
not care about anything except them.

got to do with the situation ...
