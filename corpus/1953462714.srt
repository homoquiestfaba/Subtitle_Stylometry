He was admitted 45 minutes ago,
and he's still post-stictal.

00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:08,474
Lori, Dave,
this is Dr. Neaves...

200
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:10,277
-the ped's neurological consultant here.
-Hi.

201
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,285
- Hi.
- He knows a lot about epilepsy.

202
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:15,787
Epilepsy?

203
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:18,221
Uh, yes. One seizure
is just a seizure...

204
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,418
...but two, by definition,
is epilepsy.

205
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:22,427
But he's only had one.

206
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,487
The fall you called me about
this morning was probably
another kind of seizure.

207
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:28,796
So we're going to admit him and
watch him for a couple of days.

208
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:31,803
But this is a kid who
hardly catches a cold.

209
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:33,862
How could he
have epilepsy?

210
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,602
Well, there's a lot of different
triggers for seizure disorders.

211
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:40,806
We're gonna run some tests
and see what we can find out.

212
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,405
[Dr. Neaves] I think the best way
to understand what a seizure is...

213
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:46,975
...is to think of it as
a short-circuit in Robbie's brain.

214
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:49,613
Something interferes
with the normal electrical flow...

215
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:52,180
...and everything goes
temporarily haywire.

216
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:55,159
Oh, oh, oh. It's okay. It's okay.
Look at you so brave.

217
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,891
[Dr. Neaves] Now,
Robbie's going to need a CATscan...

218
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:05,563
...so we can see if his seizures have
a cause that we can treat surgically.

219
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,904
We'll inject a dye
while his head is being X-rayed...

220
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:12,001
...and then a computer
takes a picture...

221
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,672
...just as if we'd cut
a slice of the brain.

[Tapping Computer Keys]

223
00:12:20,853 --> 00:12:25,790
The EEG is used for comparison if
Robbie's seizures change in character.

224
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:29,624
It's helpful in diagnosing
some special forms of epilepsy.

225
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:34,098
We do these tests to find out
if your son has a tumor
or lesion in his brain.

226
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:42,297
- A spinal tap is used to rule out
bacterial meningitis.
- Hold him just like that.

227
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,003
If we catch it early, it can easily
be treated with antibiotics.

228
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:48,013
- [Screaming]
- Usually we don't find anything.

229
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:51,050
[Screaming Continues]

230
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,985
We don't necessarily
need to find a cause.

231
00:12:57,056 --> 00:13:01,049
Most of the time we don't.
But we do have effective drugs.

232
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:03,891
As a matter of fact, 70 percent
of kids with epilepsy...

233
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:07,558
...have their seizures reasonably
controlled with the first medicine.

234
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,965
We'll start Robbie
with phenobarbital.

235
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:12,596
It's been around the longest,
so we know the most about it.

236
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:16,039
Although it can cause
behavioral problems...

237
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:19,670
...and is associated with withdrawal
symptoms and lowered I.Q....

238
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:23,806

do just fine.

00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:39,728
- [Rooster Crows]
- You have me to make you look good.

[Schwartz Whinnying]

328
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:48,097
I hate grammar! It's boring!

329
00:18:48,174 --> 00:18:50,472
Well, no argument there.

330
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:53,774
Um, what would make it
less boring?

331
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:57,111
- If Miss Kirchwall taught naked.
- [Laughing]

332
00:18:57,183 --> 00:18:59,777
- Gross!
- [Laughing Continues]

[Dave Sighs]

334
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:06,753
For a year I've been putting money away
to buy your mom a good horse.

335
00:19:06,826 --> 00:19:09,260
Now we've got Schwartz.

336
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:13,162
- I want to ride him.
- Mm-hmm.

337
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:17,362
How boring would it be
if I added that money to the trip jar...

338
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:20,530
...and booked us
to Hawaii next month?

339
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:23,837
And there was even enough
money left over for, um...

340
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:27,174
...scuba diving lessons
when we got there?

341
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:29,339
[Laughs]

342
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:33,784
Bring your grades up
to a mere... "B", and it's a deal.

343
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:37,949
- I'll help you.
- Whoa. Grammar rules!

344
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:40,457
[Laughs]

345
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:43,222

346
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:45,923

00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:59,742
Sorry, we're cl--
[Frustrated Grunt]

350
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:05,049
- Sorry, we're closed.
- Lori?

351
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:07,449
- Yeah.
- Bob Purdue. High school.

352
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,784
I was a couple years
ahead of you.

353
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,347
- Oh, yeah.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

354
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:15,359
Sure.

355
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:18,663
- So how you been?
- Good.

356
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:20,665
How's your boy, Robbie?

357
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:23,258
[Stammers]
Uh, h-how do you know Robbie?

358
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:26,270
I was in here a couple of months ago.
He was being your little helper.

359
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:29,273
- He took me right over
to the garden tools.
- [Laughs]

360
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:31,434
I'm sorry I didn't
recognize you then.

361
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,705
Oh, that's all right.
You were busy.

362
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:37,271
Such an ugly disease for such a sweet
little guy to have, isn't it?

363
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:39,613
Epilepsy.

364
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:43,883
Who told you
Robbie had epilepsy?

365
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:46,220
I saw his prescription
at the pharmacy.

366
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:49,728
I've taken the same drugs.
I've had epilepsy since I was four.

367
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,757
So you hide it?

368
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:57,598
No. Actually, they're not
even sure Robbie has epilepsy.

369
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,798
- [Scoffs]
- He's only had a few episodes.

370
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:04,434
Doctors are talking about
taking him off medication.

371
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,978
You sound a little
like my parents.

372
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:09,412
They still won't say
the word "epilepsy."

373
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:13,178
They call it "Bob's spells"
or "Bob's condition".

374
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:15,413
I don't remember 'em
using the word "episodes",

375
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:17,614
but I'm sure they threw
that one in there too.

376
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,624
What did you want
to talk to me about?

377
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:22,525
Lori, I know this seems
like none of my business...

378
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:25,428
...but Robbie's gonna need
a strong ally.

379
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:29,991
Robbie's got plenty of allies.
He's got his family, and he's
got some really good doctors.

380
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:33,436
But no doctor knows
what makes a seizure start or stop.

381
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:38,169
No doctor knows why the drugs work on
some people and not on others.

382
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:42,145
So your child becomes something of a
laboratory. They type-treat the drugs.

383
00:21:42,214 --> 00:21:45,308
- [Phone Ringing]
- That means they start
with a low dosage.

384
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:49,320
Then they crank it up until
either the seizures go away
or your boy becomes toxic.

385
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:53,552
- I think you better go now.
- If you place Robbie's health
entirely in their hands--

386
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:55,560
Robbie is gonna be
just fine.

Mom, if you're there,
pick up, please! Mom!

- Lynn?
- Mom, Robbie's had a horrible seizure!

389
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:06,236
- What?
- He stopped breathing.

390
00:22:06,305 --> 00:22:09,206
They took him to the hospital.
Dad went with them.

391
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:11,538
Well, take Mark
and go to Margeen.

392
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,272
Mom, is he gonna die?

393
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:17,713
No, he's not going to die.

[Woman] You're positive that
your company's kept up...

401
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:44,605
...on the contributions
to your health plan?

402
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:48,613
It's a major contractor.
It's not some fly-by-night operation.

How are you doing?

Oooh, doesn't look like
we're havin' fun yet.

Let's see if we can't
do somethin' about that.

408
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:08,827
All right, I want you to follow my
finger, okay? With your eyes.

409
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:13,201
So, Robbie was admitted
with idiopathic epilepsy?

410
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:15,502
"Idiopathic"?

411
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:17,735
Of uncertain origin.

412
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:21,576
Oh. He had a grand mal seizure
with a respiratory arrest.

413
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:25,014
And since then he's had
three more grand mals...

414
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:27,746
...plus some other kinds too.

415
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,755
Hmm, hey, the good news:

416
00:23:30,823 --> 00:23:33,758
You'll never have to worry about
Robbie being in the military.

417
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:35,760
They won't take him.

418
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:38,626
[Sighs] He was transferred here
to see a specialist.

419
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:40,961
Dr. Stanfield.
He's the best.

420
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:44,196
- [Groans]
- Okay.

421
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:49,934
Did we talk to you about
compassionate use programs?

422
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:52,408
"Compassionate use"?

423
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:54,605
During the testing period
for a new drug...

424
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,444
if it shows promise, the government will
approve its use for select people...

425
00:23:57,516 --> 00:23:59,780
...who aren't part
of the official study.

426
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:02,821
That's something Dr. Stanfield
may recommend you look into.

427
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:05,413
Mm-hmm.

428
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:07,982
See, times have changed
in medicine.

429
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,587
It's not just up to the doctor.
We look to the parents
to help chart the course.

430
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:13,824
It's called
"joint decision making".

431
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:17,130
Great. So do we have to wait
for Dr. Stanfield?

432
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:20,228
Only until tomorrow morning.

433
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,741

- Have you seen Dave?
- Not today. Isn't he working?

00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,715
I thought he was gonna take off to
come here. How are the kids?

- You're not.

I think so.

No.

Well, that's
what it says here.

483
00:26:55,827 --> 00:26:59,058
No, he was transferred here
to be evaluated by Dr. Stanfield.

Yeah, when I changed locals, there was a
six-month "no benefits" period.

492
00:27:25,657 --> 00:27:27,591
It's not up for a month.

493
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:31,151
And after that they won't
cover him because he'll have
a pre-existing condition.

494
00:27:31,229 --> 00:27:35,996
No. Nobody-- Nobody ever said anything
about a "no benefits" period!

495
00:27:39,972 --> 00:27:42,099
Supposedly, we were notified.

496
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:46,804
I read the fine print, Dave, and I do
keep records. We were not notified.

497
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:49,369
That's their policy.

498
00:27:49,448 --> 00:27:53,748
That's why. That's why
Robbie's transferred out of I.C.U.!

499
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:56,583
I'll bet you that's why Stanfield
never showed up too!

500
00:27:56,655 --> 00:27:59,920
And I'll bet you that's why they're
gonna kick us outta here!

501
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:03,155
Oh. So what are we
supposed to do now?

502
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:06,493
Well, what people
that don't have insurance do.
We take him to County Hospital.

503
00:28:06,565 --> 00:28:08,999
And you're just
gonna accept that?

504
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:12,696
- Do you have a better idea?
- Yeah, I do!

505
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:18,000
Hey, wanna see my truck?

Yeah. I put in
to drive nights.

510

No way. No way!
You promised!

511
00:28:31,957 --> 00:28:35,552
- We agreed you would never--
- You know how many thousands
of dollars we are in the hole?

512
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:38,960
Well, I'll take a telephone sales job
where I could work at home.

513
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:42,899
We could go on welfare!
But you are not gonna drive
a flammables carrier!

- My family is not going on welfare!
- [Robbie Crying]

515

There's no way you could make a dent
in our debt with hazard pay!

00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:51,408
- Do you know why they call it
hazard pay in the first place?
- [Crying Continues]

517
00:28:51,476 --> 00:28:55,412
Why don't you just take a rider on your
life insurance and live off of that?

518
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,711
- Stop yelling!
- What am I supposed to do,

Robbie's failed to respond
to most of the usual

642
00:38:43,468 --> 00:38:46,562

that he has multiple seizure types.

...there's only a 15 percent chance
the drugs will ever work.

655
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:25,902
After that,
there's only surgery.

656
00:39:25,977 --> 00:39:28,969
You shouldn't expect this
to be easy.

657
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:33,108
[Sighs] Why not? So far
it's been a piece of cake.

658
00:39:34,786 --> 00:39:37,220
Robbie's what I consider
a high-stakes case.

659
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:42,055
If I can stop his seizures,
he still has a very good chance
for a normal, healthy life.

660
00:39:42,126 --> 00:39:46,187
But a young brain can't tolerate
seizures of his intensity
and frequency indefinitely.

661
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:49,597
Well, what if you
can't stop them?

662
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,601
There are no
hard and fast rules...

663
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:54,729
...but it's not unusual to find
neurological compromises:

664
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:57,934
diminished capacity,
developmental delays...

665
00:39:58,009 --> 00:39:59,943
progressive retardation.

She's a beautiful little girl.

676
00:40:49,694 --> 00:40:52,788
And I checked with several colleagues
from across the country...

677
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:55,298
...all of them very accomplished
neurologists.

678
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:58,802
A few of them run pediatric
neurology departments at major
med schools and hospitals.

you're not ready for that yet.

683

- Oh, no, we are not.
- Oh, Lori, one other thing
they did agree on:

684
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,983
Treating seizures in kids
is much more art than science.

- Okay, Doc, thanks. Bye.

686
00:41:22,727 --> 00:41:27,596
I'll put a request in
to Dr. Abbasac for a stool softener.

Why does he have hemorrhoids?

689
00:41:32,203 --> 00:41:34,364
The medication causes
the constipation...

690
00:41:34,438 --> 00:41:37,305
...and the pushing
causes the hemorrhoids.

00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:18,618
I try to hide it at work. I don't wanna
lose my medical insurance...

819
00:50:18,689 --> 00:50:20,623
...or worse, my job.

820
00:50:20,691 --> 00:50:22,556
Can't drive.

821
00:50:25,195 --> 00:50:30,531
My marriage broke up because
the drugs keep me from being
a normal lover.

822
00:50:30,601 --> 00:50:35,595
And I seize in my sleep,
I cuss, I make animal noises.

823
00:50:38,342 --> 00:50:42,005
There is anger and loneliness.

824
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,947
But when the self-pity comes,
I try to say to myself...

825
00:50:46,016 --> 00:50:48,951
,,,instead of,
"What life do I have?"...

826
00:50:50,554 --> 00:50:53,022
..."What life can I build?"

827
00:50:58,729 --> 00:51:00,663
Then who did take it down?

828
00:51:00,731 --> 00:51:02,665
I don't know.
What are you blaming me for?

829
00:51:02,733 --> 00:51:05,827
Because it's a criminal offense
to remove a foreclosure notice.
You can go to jail.

830
00:51:05,903 --> 00:51:08,633
So you better tell me you didn't trash
it and you're gonna put it back.

831
00:51:08,706 --> 00:51:11,140
Fine. You want me to say
I took it down? I took it down.

832
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:14,541
Then put it back.

833
00:51:14,611 --> 00:51:17,409
- How come you're always
pickin' on me lately?
- I'm not pickin' on you.

834
00:51:17,481 --> 00:51:19,915
Yeah, you are. You and Mom
think everything's my fault.

835
00:51:19,983 --> 00:51:22,850
I suppose if Robbie dies
it'll be my fault too.

836
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,854
What?

837
00:51:24,922 --> 00:51:26,856
It's not like I meant what
I said. I was just mad.

00:51:26,924 --> 00:51:29,290
What are you talkin' about?

839
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,954
Oh, right. Like Mom
didn't tell you.

840
00:51:32,029 --> 00:51:34,623
Tell me what?

841
00:51:36,734 --> 00:51:40,534
I'm sorry! I didn't mean it.
I don't want Robbie to die.

842

00:53:38,522 --> 00:53:42,049
To tell you the truth, there are times
when I look at Robbie and...

871
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:45,390
and at my family, and I think if this is
the life he's destined to lead...

872
00:53:45,462 --> 00:53:49,558
...if all he has to look forward to
is more drugs, more seizures...

...come across a treatment
for epilepsy...

964
01:00:22,192 --> 01:00:25,992
...called the keto--
ketogenic diet.

965
01:00:26,062 --> 01:00:28,826
It's by a doctor
from Johns Hopkins.

966
01:00:28,899 --> 01:00:31,891
And the diet,
the best I understand it...

967
01:00:31,968 --> 01:00:35,529
...makes the body go into a fasting
state, and something about that
fasting state...

968
01:00:35,605 --> 01:00:38,005
...stops the seizures.

owns a copy.

With the exception
of the material on the ketogenic diet...

973
01:00:51,821 --> 01:00:54,449
...it's an invaluable piece
of medical literature.

974
01:00:54,524 --> 01:00:57,049
The diet is not
an approved treatment.

975
01:00:57,127 --> 01:01:00,221
- But there have been a lot of studies.
- Those studies are anecdotal...

976
01:01:00,297 --> 01:01:04,495
...not the kind of studies we base
sound medical judgement on,
not double-blind studies.

977
01:01:04,567 --> 01:01:06,728
The ketogenic diet
is highly suspect.

978
01:01:06,803 --> 01:01:10,967
You have to starve the child
to begin with, and what you
feed him consists mainly of fat...

979
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:15,068
...which is not only unpalatable
but nutritionally inadequate and
extremely difficult to maintain.

980
01:01:15,145 --> 01:01:18,410

and my experience is that
it simply doesn't work.

01:01:21,351 --> 01:01:25,720
It's the number of an outstanding
pediatric neurosurgeon on our staff.

983
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:27,984
It's time to see
if we can find a focus...

984
01:01:28,058 --> 01:01:30,652
...a starting point in the brain
for Robbie's seizures.

985
01:01:30,727 --> 01:01:34,754
If we can, there's
a good possibility we can remove it.

986
01:01:34,831 --> 01:01:36,856
Not brain surgery.
We don't want brain surgery.

987
01:01:36,933 --> 01:01:40,369
I'm not proposing surgery.
Not yet.

988
01:01:40,437 --> 01:01:42,462
I'm talking about
a diagnostic procedure.

989
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:46,066
We remove the top of the skull
and place electrodes
on the brain for a few days...

990
01:01:46,142 --> 01:01:49,373
...to see if we can map it
and try and locate the problem.

991
01:01:49,446 --> 01:01:54,748
It's the next logical step, and
I'd like to schedule it immediately.

992
01:01:54,818 --> 01:01:59,152
We can't because
we're goin' to Baltimore.

993
01:01:59,222 --> 01:02:04,353
Robbie has an appointment with
Dr. Forman at Johns Hopkins tomorrow.

994
01:02:04,427 --> 01:02:06,019
And how are you planning
to get Robbie to this appointment?

995
01:02:06,096 --> 01:02:08,894
I booked us on a flight.

996
01:02:08,965 --> 01:02:13,299
There is a danger of
a life-threatening seizure
if you stop the drugs abruptly.

997
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:15,895
Well, who's talking about
stopping drugs?

998
01:02:15,972 --> 01:02:21,410
I, uh, have administered enough
drugs to Robbie in nine months
to get a pharmacy degree.

999
01:02:29,686 --> 01:02:33,679
You'll need an ambulance
to transfer him from the hospital...

1000
01:02:33,757 --> 01:02:37,693
...a plane that will accommodate
a medical transfer, his meds...

1001
01:02:37,761 --> 01:02:43,666
...a drip, emergency oxygen
and a doctor to accompany him.

1002
01:02:43,733 --> 01:02:46,759
There is no way
that we can afford all that.

1003
01:02:49,873 --> 01:02:54,401
When you have met these conditions
for his safe transport...

1004
01:02:54,477 --> 01:02:57,412
...I'll be glad to sign
for his release.

- Yeah, I did.

1008
01:04:24,701 --> 01:04:26,635
Oh!

1009
01:04:26,703 --> 01:04:31,697
-Can I help you?
-Radiology, um-- My son needs an X ray.

1010
01:04:31,774 --> 01:04:34,868
- Let me see your lab slip.
I'll tell you where to go.
- Oh, huh--

1011
01:04:34,944 --> 01:04:39,176
I must've left that
down in emergency.

1012
01:04:39,249 --> 01:04:41,547
Take the elevator
to the first floor, follow the signs.

1013
01:04:41,618 --> 01:04:44,553
Okay, thanks.

You'll have to come with me.

[Machine Beeping,
People Chattering]

1021
01:06:19,415 --> 01:06:22,646
Do you know what would have happened
if he hadn't stopped you?

1022
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:25,916
Yeah, I'd be on a plane
to Baltimore.

1023
01:06:27,857 --> 01:06:31,486
When he was discovered missing, an all
points bulletin would have gone out.

1024
01:06:31,561 --> 01:06:34,553
- What? My arrest?
- Yes.

1025
01:06:34,631 --> 01:06:36,690
- I was the mother.
- It doesn't matter.

1026
01:06:36,766 --> 01:06:39,098
You could have been charged with
kidnapping and child endangerment.

1027
01:06:39,168 --> 01:06:42,399
- You could've lost custody.
- What?

1028
01:06:42,472 --> 01:06:45,236
The institution can petition
for legal guardianship of any child...

1029
01:06:45,308 --> 01:06:49,404
...whose interest and well-being they feel
aren't being served by his parents.

1030
01:06:49,479 --> 01:06:51,811
And the courts
usually grant it.

1031
01:06:51,881 --> 01:06:56,011
Well, what if I feel that
his interests are not being
served by the institution?

1032
01:06:56,085 --> 01:07:00,613
What if I feel that he's,
he's actually being harmed
by the whole, you know, system?

1033
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:06,026
What if-- What if I just can't sit here
and watch him... fade away?

1034
01:07:06,095 --> 01:07:08,893
Don't I have a right?
Don't I?

1035
01:07:08,965 --> 01:07:12,128
- To try to protect my own child?
- Lis-- I--

1036
01:07:12,201 --> 01:07:17,935
I shouldn't be telling you this.
I could get in a lot of trouble.

1037
01:07:18,007 --> 01:07:20,373
We had a staff meeting
this afternoon.

1038
01:07:20,443 --> 01:07:24,038
Dr. Abbasac discussed your plans
to take Robbie to Baltimore.

1039
01:07:24,113 --> 01:07:27,844
She believes you're losing it,
that your judgement's impaired.

1040
01:07:27,917 --> 01:07:30,613
- And after tonight they have
all the evidence they need--
- Oh, they're not--

1041
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:33,121
they're not talkin' about
takin' Robbie away from me.

1042
01:07:33,189 --> 01:07:38,126
She's on her way down here now.
It might be best if you were
gone when she gets here.

1043
01:07:43,399 --> 01:07:45,333
All right.

1044
01:07:47,203 --> 01:07:51,003
I don't agree with the doctor.
I think you know your child
better than any of us...

1045
01:07:51,074 --> 01:07:55,443
...and you're just trying to do
what's right for him.

1046
01:07:55,511 --> 01:07:59,311
A lot of kids get well here...

1047
01:07:59,382 --> 01:08:02,146
...but Robbie's not.

[Screams]

1051
01:09:00,643 --> 01:09:05,046
So even though we missed
the appointment, I went back
and looked it up again.

1052
01:09:05,114 --> 01:09:07,742
And all these doctors
had the same results.

1053
01:09:07,817 --> 01:09:13,050
About a third of the kids
that stick with the diet
have their seizures go away.

1054
01:09:13,122 --> 01:09:17,183
And another third are
significantly improved. Look.

1055
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:21,458
1927. Dr. Hemholtz
from the Mayo Clinic.

01:09:21,531 --> 01:09:23,897
Uh, 1937.

01:09:23,966 --> 01:09:28,369
That's Dr. Wilkins
from Johns Hopkins.

01:09:28,438 --> 01:09:31,896
And-- And--
And 1954, 1973.

1059
01:09:31,974 --> 01:09:34,841
Dr. Livingston
from Hopkins.

Published 1992.
Johns Hopkins.

1064
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:56,326
They took 58 of the sickest kids,
put them on the ketogenic diet...

1065
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:00,426
...and almost a third of'em
had their seizures go away.

1066
01:10:00,503 --> 01:10:05,736
The 1920s? How many kids like Robbie
have there been since then?

1067
01:10:05,808 --> 01:10:08,902
I mean, how many children
have been given drugs and operated on...

1068
01:10:08,978 --> 01:10:11,378
...and not one of them
was told of this diet?

1069
01:10:11,447 --> 01:10:13,381
Something doesn't make sense.

1070
01:10:13,449 --> 01:10:17,078
I mean, if all the doctors
we've talked to know
about this "kenogenic" diet--

1071
01:10:17,153 --> 01:10:19,986
- Ketogenic.
- Ketogenic diet.

1072
01:10:20,056 --> 01:10:23,753
Even if they don't like it
for some reason, don't they
have to tell us about it?

1073
01:10:23,826 --> 01:10:26,624
Can they really censor
information like this?

1074
01:10:26,696 --> 01:10:31,258
How can there be joint decision
making if they don't give us
information, tell us options?

1075
01:10:31,334 --> 01:10:33,268
Didn't you say Doc Peterson...

1076
01:10:33,336 --> 01:10:36,237
talked with
his neurologist friends about Robbie...

1077
01:10:36,305 --> 01:10:39,103
...and not one of them
mentioned a diet?

1078
01:10:39,175 --> 01:10:41,439
That's right.

1079
01:10:41,511 --> 01:10:43,979
Just drugs... and surgery.

1080
01:10:44,046 --> 01:10:47,948
If this stands any chance
of working, let alone...

1081
01:10:48,017 --> 01:10:52,420
...a one in three chance
of stopping his seizures altogether...

1082
01:10:54,524 --> 01:10:58,119
...why would they rob us
of that hope?

be of some help to you.

Come in.

1097
01:12:11,033 --> 01:12:13,729
- There's no need to have
an attorney present.
- I'm not a lawyer.

1098
01:12:13,803 --> 01:12:17,261
- I'm a friend of the family.
- This is Jim Peterson. Dr. Abbasac.

1099
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:20,571
This is Dr. Alison,
the pediatric neurosurgeon
I mentioned to Lori.

1100
01:12:20,643 --> 01:12:23,806
- How do you do?
- Hi.

1101
01:12:23,879 --> 01:12:26,677
Please sit down.

1102
01:12:26,749 --> 01:12:31,345
I examined Robbie this morning
and, uh, reviewed his record.

1103
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:34,651
We have his procedure
scheduled for tomorrow morning.

1104
01:12:34,724 --> 01:12:38,353
I'll just need the signed
consent form I gave you
so we can process the paperwork.

1105
01:12:40,997 --> 01:12:43,431
The Reimullers have decided
to go in another direction.

1106
01:12:43,499 --> 01:12:47,959
They're gonna enroll their child
in the ketogenic diet program
at Johns Hopkins.

1107
01:12:49,905 --> 01:12:53,204
I told Lori what conditions
for safe transfer must be met...

1108
01:12:53,275 --> 01:12:56,335
...including a medical doctor
to accompany Robbie.

1109
01:12:56,412 --> 01:12:58,471
Now, I don't know
of a single M.D. who would endorse...

1110
01:12:58,547 --> 01:13:01,778
...the kind of foolishness she's
proposing to subject her son to.

1111
01:13:01,851 --> 01:13:04,718
Of course you don't.
Since so many in our profession...

1112
01:13:04,787 --> 01:13:07,449
...choose not to look beyond
the limits of drugs and surgery.

1113
01:13:07,523 --> 01:13:11,323
It's what made me change careers, but
I've kept my medical license current.

1114
01:13:11,394 --> 01:13:15,592
- You're a physician?
- We'll meet your conditions
for Robbie's safe transfer.

1115
01:13:15,665 --> 01:13:18,133
I'll accompany him
to Baltimore.

1116
01:13:20,803 --> 01:13:25,035
I assume you've spoken to Johns Hopkins
about these arrangements?

1117
01:13:26,409 --> 01:13:29,970
I have, and the arrangements
have been made.

1118
01:13:30,046 --> 01:13:32,310
They're expecting us.

1119
01:13:32,381 --> 01:13:35,373
Dr. Peterson?

1120
01:13:35,451 --> 01:13:39,717
I assume you know
all the evidence in favor of
the ketogenic diet is anecdotal.

1121
01:13:39,789 --> 01:13:42,883
There is absolutely
no scientific evidence this diet works.

1122
01:13:42,958 --> 01:13:47,657
When you say scientific evidence,
if you mean double-blind studies...

1123
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:50,198
...then I have to ask you,
where are the double-blind
studies on the effects...

1124
01:13:50,266 --> 01:13:53,758
...of the interactions between all
the drugs you've had Robbie on?

1125
01:13:53,836 --> 01:13:55,997
Where are the studies
on the surgery you'll propose...

1126
01:13:56,072 --> 01:13:58,632
...as a result
of the electrocorticogram?

1127
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:04,578
Dr. Abbasac, to arbitrarily
pretend that your treatments
for epilepsy are science...

1128
01:14:04,647 --> 01:14:06,638
...and then argue against
a ketogenic diet...

1129
01:14:06,716 --> 01:14:10,345
...seems to me to be the cruelest
of double standards.

1130
01:14:10,419 --> 01:14:14,822
When you and I became doctors,
we swore an oath that said,
"First do no harm. "

1131
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:17,723
Now, if these folks wanna try
to control their son's seizures...

1132
01:14:17,793 --> 01:14:20,694
...by changing what he eats
instead of drugs and surgery...

1133
01:14:20,763 --> 01:14:23,664
...well, I think
they deserve that chance.

1134
01:14:31,674 --> 01:14:36,270
Dr. Abbasac gave the order
to pull him off the paraldehyde...

1135
01:14:36,345 --> 01:14:39,280
...to prevent respiratory problems
while he's traveling.

1136
01:14:39,348 --> 01:14:43,785
Hopefully there'll still
be enough left in his blood
to keep him from seizing.

1137
01:14:45,688 --> 01:14:50,057
I put in for a couple
of vacation days, and my supervisor's...

1138
01:14:50,126 --> 01:14:52,560
...pulling together the meds
he'll need for the trip.

1139
01:14:52,628 --> 01:14:56,826
You're goin' with us, then?

1140
01:14:56,899 --> 01:15:02,303
Things don't fall into place
the way this has-- Dr. Peterson
offering to go with you...

1141
01:15:02,371 --> 01:15:05,670
...another space opening up
for Robbie at Hopkins--

1142
01:15:05,741 --> 01:15:09,040
unless they're meant to be.

1143
01:15:09,111 --> 01:15:14,549
Besides, I think Dr. Peterson
is volunteering his degree,
not his expertise.

1144
01:15:14,617 --> 01:15:16,847
If something should go wrong,
he'd need me.

1145
01:15:16,919 --> 01:15:20,446
I haven't seen a doctor
insert an IV in 15 years.

1146
01:15:20,523 --> 01:15:22,991
[Laughs]

1147
01:15:28,197 --> 01:15:30,188
- Heads up.
- Hey.

1148
01:15:30,266 --> 01:15:33,133
Found a place for you
to stay... free!

1149
01:15:33,202 --> 01:15:35,966
Wh-- Holy Sisters
of Saint Francis?

1150
01:15:36,038 --> 01:15:38,336
Mmm! My sister
was a novice there.

1151
01:15:38,407 --> 01:15:42,503
She says the nuns are very nice,
even though they don't talk.

1152
01:15:42,578 --> 01:15:45,672
- Uh! Mom in a silent convent?
- [Laughs]

1153
01:15:45,748 --> 01:15:49,149
Well, it could happen.

1154
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:54,986
Come on, buddy.
Whoa!

1155
01:15:55,057 --> 01:15:58,026
We're goin' on an airplane,
you know that?

1156
01:15:58,093 --> 01:16:01,790
Big, big, big one.

1157
01:16:05,434 --> 01:16:08,597
I'm excited, Mommy.

1158
01:16:12,107 --> 01:16:16,737
You know that I believe in my bones
what you're doing is wrong.

1159
01:16:16,812 --> 01:16:19,246
I know you do.

1160
01:16:21,317 --> 01:16:26,311
I've been told over the years that I'm
not the easiest person to deal with.

1161
01:16:28,257 --> 01:16:33,320
I hope you're not sacrificing
this beautiful child to
a personality conflict with me.

1162
01:16:36,332 --> 01:16:40,666
He's my boy, and I'm his mom.
I'm just doing what I think is right.

1163
01:16:42,371 --> 01:16:47,274
If it were your child, can you honestly
say you'd do anything different?

1164
01:16:52,915 --> 01:16:54,849
I'll be sending you
little bird kisses.

1165
01:16:54,917 --> 01:16:56,976
Hope you get to ride
in a jumbo jet.

1166
01:16:57,052 --> 01:16:58,986
Bye, buddy.

1167
01:16:59,054 --> 01:17:01,147
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Mom.

1168
01:17:01,223 --> 01:17:03,157
- I'll take care of him.
- Okay.

1169
01:17:03,225 --> 01:17:06,126
- Thanks.
- Be nice to the nuns.

1170
01:17:08,163 --> 01:17:10,097
Be careful.

1171
01:17:16,472 --> 01:17:18,565
- Bye, Robbie.
- Have a good flight!

1172
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:23,944
Good luck, squirt.

1173
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:36,549
[Robbie Whimpering]

1174
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:39,560
- Put this underneath.
- We've arranged for an ambulance.

1175
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:44,031
- It's okay.
- It's already been 15 minutes.

1176
01:17:44,099 --> 01:17:48,729
- Should we give him
some Valium intramuscularly?
- That's it.

1177
01:17:48,804 --> 01:17:51,568
- He's okay.
- Good. I'll tell the pilot.

1178
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:54,768
- That's it, sweetie.
- [Sighs]

1179
01:17:54,843 --> 01:17:56,777
[Sighs]

1180
01:17:58,847 --> 01:18:01,407
[Tires Screeching]

1181
01:18:08,257 --> 01:18:10,191
[People Chattering]

1182
01:18:12,294 --> 01:18:14,728
- Hi.
- May I help you?

1183
01:18:14,797 --> 01:18:16,924
I'm-- I'm Lori Reimuller.

1184
01:18:18,567 --> 01:18:23,334
Oh, yes, Mrs. Reimuller.
Your son's appointment was two days ago.

1185
01:18:23,405 --> 01:18:27,671
I know, I know, I know. But, uh, this
was the soonest that we could get here.

1186
01:18:27,743 --> 01:18:31,645
I'm sorry. Don't you remember
I told you very clearly on the phone...

1187
01:18:31,714 --> 01:18:37,448
...we have no appointment openings
with Dr. Forman or available
beds in our hospital program.

1188
01:18:37,519 --> 01:18:42,718
He has to be in the hospital.
He transferred out of pediatric
intensive care to come here.

1189
01:18:43,759 --> 01:18:45,693
Wait here.

1190
01:18:52,968 --> 01:18:55,436
What do we got here?

1191
01:18:55,504 --> 01:18:58,598
Oh! This is Robbie Reimuller.
I'm his mom.

1192
01:18:58,674 --> 01:19:01,666
- Uh, I have his medical records.
- I've seen them.

1193
01:19:01,744 --> 01:19:06,113
As my receptionist told you,
there are no more beds in the clinic.

1194
01:19:06,181 --> 01:19:08,775
Please, you're not gonna tell me
after we've come all this way...

1195
01:19:08,851 --> 01:19:12,844
- ...that we have to turn around
and go... back.
- [Moans]

1196
01:19:17,559 --> 01:19:20,653
It's of the utmost importance
that the ketogenic diet be started...

1197
01:19:20,729 --> 01:19:22,993
...under strict
medical supervision.

1198
01:19:23,065 --> 01:19:26,193
There are risks.
Do you have a place nearby to stay?

1199
01:19:26,268 --> 01:19:28,702
Yes, yes.
Five minutes away.

1200
01:19:28,771 --> 01:19:31,399
No needles. Follow.

1201
01:19:31,473 --> 01:19:33,771
When was his last meal?

1202
01:19:33,842 --> 01:19:35,901
Uh, breakfast, this morning.

1203
01:19:35,978 --> 01:19:38,446
Push.

1204
01:19:38,514 --> 01:19:41,005
All right.
No more food for two days.

1205
01:19:41,083 --> 01:19:43,677
- And then we'll start the diet.
- [Sighs]

1206
01:19:43,752 --> 01:19:47,483
You know, they took him off
paraldehyde to make the trip out here.

1207
01:19:47,556 --> 01:19:51,754
And the place where we're staying isn't
really set up for a sick child.

1208
01:19:51,827 --> 01:19:54,728
He wants to be treated
like a normal healthy boy.

1209
01:19:54,797 --> 01:19:57,857
Do that, starting now.

1210
01:20:00,035 --> 01:20:03,266
I've been on an airplane.

1211
01:20:03,338 --> 01:20:05,670
And how'd you like that?

1212
01:20:05,741 --> 01:20:07,675
Fun.

1213
01:20:07,743 --> 01:20:10,439
[Chuckles]

1214
01:20:10,512 --> 01:20:13,743
[Sighs]

1215
01:20:13,816 --> 01:20:17,946
I'm sorry. I thought he would be
staying in the hospital.

1216
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:23,117
I wouldn't ask you except that
we don't have anyplace else to go.

1217
01:20:23,192 --> 01:20:27,891
No male has ever
slept on these premises.

1218
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:36,103
[Sighs] If you can manage
with the simple essentials...

1219
01:20:36,171 --> 01:20:41,131
...you're both welcome to stay
with us as long as you need to.

1220
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:44,941
- Thank you.
- Sister Josephine
will show you to your room.

1221
01:20:45,013 --> 01:20:47,379
Can I have a minute?

1222
01:20:54,022 --> 01:20:56,855
If, uh, he gets bad,
you be sure and call 911.

1223
01:20:56,925 --> 01:21:01,988
The hospital can always find
a bed on an emergency basis.

1224
01:21:02,064 --> 01:21:06,967
I know "sorry" doesn't
begin to cover it, but--

1225
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:11,096
You understand
if anything had happened...

1226
01:21:11,173 --> 01:21:15,576
,,,Marissa could've lost
her license and her livelihood.

1227
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:19,873
[Sighs]

1228
01:21:26,188 --> 01:21:28,679
- Thank you.
- Oh.

1229
01:21:28,757 --> 01:21:33,694
I wonder if you'll ever know
how lucky you are to have
this lady for a mother.

1230
01:21:39,268 --> 01:21:42,032
- There you go, buddy.
- Hey.

1231
01:21:42,104 --> 01:21:44,766
- [Laughs]
- Thanks.

1232
01:21:50,846 --> 01:21:52,780
Okay.

1233
01:22:10,165 --> 01:22:13,464
- Hi.
- Good morning. How's
everything going so far?

1234
01:22:13,535 --> 01:22:17,027
Good! I, um,
I dreaded the fast.

1235
01:22:17,105 --> 01:22:21,166
I thought he'd be beggin'me
for food, but so far he's not.

1236
01:22:21,243 --> 01:22:24,076
He has had... seizures
the last two days...

1237
01:22:24,146 --> 01:22:26,580
...but only small ones.

1238
01:22:26,648 --> 01:22:32,280
I don't know if it's
my imagination or not, but his
whole body seems more relaxed.

1239
01:22:32,354 --> 01:22:36,757
Many parents notice positive changes
during the fasting period.

1240
01:22:36,825 --> 01:22:39,259
Fasting rests the body.

1241
01:22:39,328 --> 01:22:43,162
Now, you'll know within
a month whether the diet
is gonna work for Robbie.

1242
01:22:43,232 --> 01:22:45,962
And if it does, you'll
keep him on it for two to three years...

1243
01:22:46,034 --> 01:22:48,525
...before returning him
to a normal diet.

1244
01:22:48,604 --> 01:22:52,700
- Okay.
- To be effective, the ketogenic diet...

1245
01:22:52,774 --> 01:22:55,607
...must be rigidly controlled.

1246
01:22:55,677 --> 01:22:59,204
Each meal is precalculated, and all
foods are weighed on a gram scale.

1247
01:22:59,281 --> 01:23:02,717
- Right.
- It's difficult.

1248
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:07,983
Well, is it more difficult
than watchin' your kid have
a hundred seizures a day?

1249
01:23:08,056 --> 01:23:10,650
I've been teaching
and administering the ketogenic diet...

1250
01:23:10,726 --> 01:23:13,718
...here at Hopkins
since 1949...

1251
01:23:13,795 --> 01:23:16,286
...to well over 500 patients.

1252
01:23:16,365 --> 01:23:21,632
I've never seen a parent,
win, lose or draw, that regrets
having given it a try.

1253
01:23:24,806 --> 01:23:27,468
Dear Dave, Lynn and Mark:

1254
01:23:27,542 --> 01:23:31,979
This is day five.
I'm holding my breath.

1255
01:23:32,047 --> 01:23:36,381
No seizures
for three whole days.

1256
01:23:36,451 --> 01:23:38,385
Not one.

1257
01:23:38,453 --> 01:23:42,082
I guess it could be the drugs, but we
already started to take them away.

1258
01:23:42,157 --> 01:23:47,117
The plate is already weighed
and now I'm gonna weigh out 17 grams--

1259
01:23:47,195 --> 01:23:52,724
Mrs. Kelly, the dietician here--
she's been so enthusiastic and helpful.

1260
01:23:52,801 --> 01:23:56,202
She treats us like we were her first
patients. It's hard to believe...

1261
01:23:56,271 --> 01:23:59,331
...she's been doin'this
for over 40 years.

1262
01:23:59,408 --> 01:24:04,004
See how close
to 17 that is? Yeah.

1263
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:08,072
- I wanna know how good it tastes.
- [Laughs] He loves bacon.

1264
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:12,416
Robbie's meals are actually
much better looking
than I thought they'd be.

1265
01:24:12,487 --> 01:24:14,421
And he wolfs 'em down.

1266
01:24:14,489 --> 01:24:16,889
[Priest]
Our scripture today is from Matthew 17.

1267
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:18,926
"A man came to Him
saying, 'Lord..."

1268
01:24:18,994 --> 01:24:22,987
"...have mercy on my son,
for he has epilepsy
and suffers severely'.

1269
01:24:23,065 --> 01:24:25,966
"And Jesus rebuked the demon,
and he came out of him..."

1270
01:24:26,034 --> 01:24:29,026
"...and the child was cured
from that very hour.

1271
01:24:29,104 --> 01:24:31,538
"Then the disciples came
to Jesus privately and said..."

1272
01:24:31,606 --> 01:24:34,006
"...'Why could not
we cast him out?'"

1273
01:24:34,076 --> 01:24:39,844
"And Jesus said, 'This kind does not
go out except by prayer and fasting'."

1274
01:24:39,915 --> 01:24:42,213
Let us pray. Father...

1275
01:24:42,284 --> 01:24:45,378
...we ask Your blessing
on this child, Robbie...

1276
01:24:45,454 --> 01:24:50,016
...that he may come forth from
sickness into health, to live
as Your servant in wholeness--

1277
01:24:50,092 --> 01:24:53,926
[Lori] The nuns are
so good to us. They really
made us feel welcome.

1278
01:24:53,995 --> 01:24:58,932
And we're trying not to disrupt
their lives too much.

1279
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:05,166
- Roast beef.
- I'm almost afraid to say this,
but I think this is working.

1280
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:08,767
- Tonight we have a choice of--
- I know it is.

1281
01:25:11,012 --> 01:25:14,243
Dave, I keep remembering
the questions you asked...

1282
01:25:14,316 --> 01:25:16,910
...about the doctors
censoring information...

1283
01:25:16,985 --> 01:25:20,682
...and robbing us
even of hope.

1284
01:25:20,756 --> 01:25:23,691
And I keep wondering, what could
have gone so horribly wrong...

1285
01:25:23,759 --> 01:25:26,193
...with this whole
medical system?

1286
01:25:29,664 --> 01:25:31,598
Hey, I'll race ya!

1287
01:25:31,666 --> 01:25:35,659
We gave them our son.
We gave them our trust.

1288
01:25:35,737 --> 01:25:38,570
We damn near had
to give 'em our home.

1289
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:42,701
But instead of giving us
the simplest information...

1290
01:25:42,778 --> 01:25:46,544
...they abused Robbie, and
they almost destroyed us all.

1291
01:25:46,615 --> 01:25:52,451
- Yea, I won! I won!
- Not that any of'em will ever ask...

1292
01:25:52,521 --> 01:25:57,424
...but I wonder if they have
any idea of the pain they caused.

1293
01:25:57,492 --> 01:25:59,653
And I wonder if someday
I'm gonna be able to find...

1294
01:25:59,728 --> 01:26:03,220
...in my heart a way
to get past the anger...

1295
01:26:03,298 --> 01:26:05,357
...and feel forgiveness.

1296
01:26:07,302 --> 01:26:11,739
I don't know, Dave.
I don't know.

- Yeah, we're fine.

1299
01:26:24,753 --> 01:26:28,052
- How's Robbie doing?
- Well...

1300
01:26:30,826 --> 01:26:34,853
...he's almost
our old kid again.

1301
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:37,626
I think he's comin' back
to us, Dave.

1302
01:26:37,699 --> 01:26:39,997
Ohh.

1303
01:26:40,068 --> 01:26:42,536
- Thank God.
- [Laughs]

1304
01:26:42,604 --> 01:26:45,402
I miss you so much.

I miss you too.

1306
01:26:48,243 --> 01:26:50,211
I miss us.

1307
01:26:52,214 --> 01:26:54,512
Do you miss us?

1308
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:57,984
Oh, boy, do I miss us.

1310
01:27:02,357 --> 01:27:05,019
Tell me.

1311

- Dave, we're in a convent here.

1312
01:27:09,498 --> 01:27:12,433

01:27:56,711 --> 01:27:59,271
- Do you see him anywhere?
- I don't see him.

1318

See him?

1319
01:28:08,623 --> 01:28:10,648
Hey, squirt!

1320
01:28:10,725 --> 01:28:13,125
Good goin',
but you need to hang on.

1321
01:28:13,194 --> 01:28:15,958
I don't need to. I'm big!

1322
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:20,268
Gotcha!
