It's like 10.

13
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:26,673
- Wine, it's called Malbec.

14
00:01:26,723 --> 00:01:30,491
It's from Argentina and it's
really expensive, for you.

15
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,243
I'm happy for you two.

16
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,073
- You could try to sound sincere.

17
00:01:34,123 --> 00:01:36,706
- I was, it's really expensive.

18
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:43,089
- Thanks, bro.
- I promised one hour.

19
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:45,118
- Could you try just a little?

20
00:01:45,168 --> 00:01:46,798
- I mean, I'm here, is Mom here?

21
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:49,777
- Look, she's making the effort.

22
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:52,227
Can I please have one person on my side,

23
00:01:52,277 --> 00:01:54,110
without having to beg?

24
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,824
- Like tonight or for life?
- Look, just try, okay?

25
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,577
- Amy, listen, I'm sorry
for being rude earlier.

26
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,417
I really just wanna say
I am happy for you, okay?

27
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:11,876
So, if you'd just please refrain
from kissing other guys...

28
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:13,267
- Alex!
- What, they don't know?

29
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:15,286
- Can we not do this tonight?
- Okay.

30
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:17,137
What I was trying to say is,

31
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:19,796
welcome to our incredibly
dysfunctional family.

32
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:22,267
You're gonna fit right in.

33
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:24,457
- That is seriously the sweetest thing

34
00:02:24,507 --> 00:02:26,424
you've ever said to me.

35
00:02:28,936 --> 00:02:30,177
- Okay.

36
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:31,406
Love you, bro.

37
00:02:31,456 --> 00:02:32,917
- You too.
- Mm-hm.

38
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:34,550
- And you, I guess.

39
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,310
- He's sweet.

40
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:43,187
- What?

41
00:02:43,237 --> 00:02:46,237
(lively rock music)

42
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:03,107
- (sighs) Are you guys serious?

43
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:04,455
Our older brother died of lung cancer,

44
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,757
and you think it's a
good idea to smoke here?

45
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:09,668
(man chuckles)

46
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:10,885
- Sorry, dude.

47
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:17,898
- Thank you.

48
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:37,029
One hour.

49
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,309
(woman clears her throat)

50
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:43,609
Hey.
- You're...

51
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,269
- You first.

52
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,821
- Your brother died of lung cancer?

53
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:50,121
- Oh, uh, yeah.

54
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,261
This is how I remember him,
it makes me feel closer.

55
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:56,890
- What was his name?

56
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,940
- Aron.

57
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,269
- My brother's name was
Carter, also in the past tense.

58
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,200
I only bring that up 'cause
he died of lung cancer too.

59
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,341
Do you mind?

60
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:11,141
- Uh, yeah, not at all, go ahead.

61
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,389
- How old was Aron when he passed?

62
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,589
- 20, and Carter?

63
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,639
- Also 20.

64
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:26,650
- Sadly, it seems like we
already have so much in common.

65
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,069
- Yeah, dead family members
and having brown hair.

66
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,119
I'm weak.

67
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,250
- How'd you know?

68
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,607
- One of the guys you kicked out of here

69
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:41,160
went to apologize to
your brother for smoking.

70
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,210
- Narc.

71
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,170
All right, so I'm guessing,

72
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,779
you don't have a dead brother either?

73
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:47,246
- You'd be right.

74
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:50,259
- So, what're you doing out here?

75
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:53,730
- Well, I was outside, talking
to a guy named Gary about

76
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,661
his job as a corporate accountant
for Kaiser Permanentic.

77
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:58,895
Yeah, I thought accountants were aware

78
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,019
that nobody wants to hear about their job.

79
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,400
Then your brother made a quick
announcement, apologizing

80
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,400
for the lowlife on the
patio who's gonna die alone.

81
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,367
I thought, you know, that
sounds like more fun.

82
00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:16,088
So, why don't you wanna be here?

83
00:05:16,138 --> 00:05:20,080
- Well, we've all gathered
here to celebrate two people

84
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,248
who made a plan to celebrate
this same shit in the future.

85
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:25,400
So, it's a little
redundant, in my opinion.

86
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,233
- Cynical.

87
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:27,488
- Inside every cynical person,

88
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:29,210
there's a disappointed idealist.

89
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,197
- Hemingway?
- Close.

90
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,747
George Carlin. (chuckles)

91
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:39,687
So, what are you doing at this party?

92
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:41,589
- I live across the street.

93
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,517
Yeah, they invited me to be polite.

94
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,103
I'm guessing they probably
wanted to avoid that

95
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:48,327
awkward conversation with the
weird girl who's always home.

96
00:05:48,377 --> 00:05:50,549
- You're always home?
- I work from home.

97
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:54,786
- So is there a live-in boyfriend
or a boyfriend in general?

98
00:05:54,836 --> 00:05:56,593
- Skipping the whole "I
work from home" thing?

99
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:57,723
- Well, I'm positive that it has

100
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:58,975
something to do with the internet.

101
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:01,657
You're probably like a food
blogger or a YouTube celebrity.

102
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:04,698
I mean, either way, I'd
be disappointed, so.

103
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:07,317
- Wow, okay, first, no boyfriend.

104
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,079
Second, not a celebrity, I'm a translator.

105
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:11,484
- Okay, so what was your last job?

106
00:06:11,508 --> 00:06:14,729
- The United Nations.
- Oh, shit.

107
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,196
That's something.

108
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:22,186
Are you CIA, KGB?

109
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:25,640
Be honest, are you a spy?

110
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,448
- (chuckles) Okay, your turn.

111
00:06:28,498 --> 00:06:30,160
Impress me.

112
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,877
- I am a line cook at
a restaurant downtown,

113
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:37,170
that is famous for steak sandwiches.

114
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,581
- That's the moment
you chose to be honest?

115
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:42,631
Sexy.

116
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:45,354
- I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu.

117
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,461
- To make sandwiches.

118
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:49,844
- Everyone likes sandwiches.

119
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:56,360
You wanna get outta here?

120
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,450
- (chuckles) What part
of this conversation

121
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,667
made you think I wanna leave with you?

122
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,179
Just kidding.

123
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:05,396

141

No, sir, we're just out for a walk.

142
00:07:54,484 --> 00:07:57,253
- This is how it starts.

143
00:07:57,303 --> 00:08:00,325

149

00:11:06,997 --> 00:11:10,627
- Tonight ended better than I thought.

192
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:13,177
- Eh, it was okay.
- Excuse me?

193
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:20,036
- I'm just trying to stall.
- What are you stalling?

194
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,168
- I don't wanna leave yet.

195
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:26,385
- Did you plan on leaving?

196
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:30,928
- No, I'm just trying to get
myself emotionally prepared

197
00:11:30,978 --> 00:11:33,728
for when you kick me out of here.

198
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:40,785
- You can stay.

199
00:11:41,906 --> 00:11:42,906
- Yeah?

200
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,477
I don't think I've ever done that before.

201
00:11:57,527 --> 00:11:59,448
- [Woman] What, have sex?

202
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:02,168
- No.
(woman chuckles)

203
00:12:02,218 --> 00:12:06,027
No, like, push a girl's
hair behind their ear.

204
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:07,696
- Mm, never?

205
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:08,746
- [Man] No.

206
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:11,377
- Girls like that.

207
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:13,858
- [Man] Why?

208
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:18,000
- I don't know, I can't explain it.

209
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,883
It makes me feel safe.

210
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:24,469
And beautiful at the same time.

211
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,789
- Don't think I ever wanna leave.

212
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:28,589
- [Woman] Then don't.

213
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,308
- That's movin' a little
fast, don't you think?

214
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:38,775
- [Woman] Do you?

215
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,610
- Nah.

216
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,307
- [Woman] Me neither.

217
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:51,509
- So, it's settled, then.

218
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:56,392
I'm never leaving.

227
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,448
- Today, you get toast,
as you were too lazy

228

to cook for yourself.
- You just do it better now.

- Oh, says the chef who relies
on Chef Boyardee at home.

(phone clicks)

237
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:17,408
How was work?

238
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:21,907
- Uh, it was fine, just
one job, took 20 minutes.

240
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,208
- What was it?

241
00:14:31,258 --> 00:14:34,406
- Uh, it was correspondence
stuff, textiles or somethin'.

242
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,039
(phone clicks)

243
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:40,826

244
00:14:41,577 --> 00:14:42,488
I'm here.

245
00:14:42,538 --> 00:14:44,058
- I hope so.

246
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:46,819
I need your utilities before next week.

247
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:48,950
- Well, I'm glad you still need me.

248
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,159
- [Man] Look, don't be dramatic, Alex.

250
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,427
- Jaime, stop!

251
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:01,858
Can we go somewhere?

252
00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:03,153
- Why, are you gonna get out of bed?

253
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:04,567
- I will.

254
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:06,077
- You wanna go to Disneyland?

255
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:07,647
- Anything.

256
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:09,407
Seriously, we can go anywhere.

257
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:12,887
I'll run your errands with
you, I just wanna be with you.

258
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:15,106
- I know, but you live with me.

259
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:17,818
- Okay, so surprise me, then.

260
00:15:17,868 --> 00:15:19,898
I want mystery.

261
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:21,466
- Wait, is this because I took a piss

262
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:24,317
with the door open yesterday?

263
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:26,495
(chuckles)

264
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:27,466
- [Alex] Okay.

265
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:29,095
- Alexandra.

266
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:30,455
Hey.

267
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:34,338
Look, I'm just finishin'
up work emails, okay?

268
00:15:35,305 --> 00:15:37,142
Give me a few minutes and we
can walk down to the corner

269
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,357
store and I'll get you
that dirty sexy chai.

270
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:41,014
- It's raining outside.

271
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:43,092
I don't wanna walk out there,
I fucking hate the rain.

272
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:46,306
- Well, it's about to
stop and I love the rain.

273
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:49,856
(distant thunder rumbles)

274
00:16:06,305 --> 00:16:08,222
- Did we move too fast?

275
00:16:10,163 --> 00:16:13,663
(distant thunder rumbles)

276
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,668
On Fridays, all the
foreign exchange kids would

277
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:32,218
skip class and this one time,
we go back to the dorms,

278
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:34,713
and we were so drunk, I
couldn't believe we made it,

279
00:16:34,737 --> 00:16:38,658
and everybody passed out, even
though it was like seven PM.

280
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:43,291
But I stayed up, talking to
this German guy, Christian,

281
00:16:44,718 --> 00:16:47,359
who's actually the
reason I started smoking.

282
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:48,869
- Mm-hm!

283
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:52,419
- And, uh, I don't know, it just happened.

284
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:55,117
- And you were 19?
- Mm-hm.

285
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,037
I had dated before that, but,

286
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,068
I was so awkward, I never
really went very far.

287
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:01,757
- Wow, really?

288
00:17:01,807 --> 00:17:03,618
- (chuckles) Yeah.

289
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:06,501
So, when did you lose your V card?

290
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:10,090
- I thought we weren't
supposed to discuss numbers?

291
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,164
- I didn't ask you for a number,

292
00:17:11,188 --> 00:17:12,588
I just asked you for the first one.

293
00:17:12,628 --> 00:17:14,194
- Yeah, I know, but
you always get so weird

294
00:17:14,218 --> 00:17:15,218
about this kind of stuff.

295
00:17:15,258 --> 00:17:18,679
- Come on, you asked me, now go.

296
00:17:18,729 --> 00:17:19,989
How old?

297
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,658
- 15, like a normal person.
- Mm-hm, and to who?

298
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:28,279
- This girl, Becky, a
little neighborhood slut.

299
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:30,890
(both laugh)

300
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,940
And Jeff.

301
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,610
- Wait, (chuckles) what?

302
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,660
- Yeah.

303
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,743
- [Waiter] Table's ready.

304
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:46,709
- You care to fill me in on the details

305
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:49,109
of that little number?
(Jaime chuckles)

306
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:50,756
You can't just drop
something like that, like,

307
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,658
"oh, I lost, my first
time was a threesome."

308
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:53,791
- Okay, okay.

309
00:17:55,449 --> 00:18:00,351
Yeah, so Becky was her name,
and she convinced me to have

310
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:04,140
a threesome with her and her
goth-ass saxophone teacher.

311
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,117
And he would come over every
Thursday and supposedly

312
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:10,270
teach her lessons, but her
parents wondered why she

313
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,717
wasn't getting any better and
what they were paying him for.

314
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:16,340
Anyway, we got really high,

315
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,631
and hooked up in her dad's jacuzzi.

316
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,999
- All three of you?
- All three of us.

317
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:24,909
Yeah.
- (chuckles) What a creep!

318
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:27,876
- Yeah, yeah, I guess he kinda was.

319
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:29,690
But you know, I think he hooked up

320
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,580
with a lot of his high school students.

321
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,189
I wonder if he's still teachin'.

322
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:35,900
- In prison.
- In prison, probably, yeah.

323
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,850
(chuckles)

324
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,170
- It's so weird to look
back at it like that.

325
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,239
You know, like it makes me feel so old.

326
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:42,399
- [Jaime] Right?

327
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:43,916
I mean, I think about middle school kids

328
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,377
doin' half the shit that I used to do.

329
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:47,959
- Oh, they are children.
- They're children, thank you.

330
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:48,911
- Thanks.

331
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,460
Children acting like idiots.
- Yeah, well...

332
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,311
- God, but it's so funny,
'cause at the time,

333
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:56,439
you think you're so adult, you know?

334
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:58,257
And looking back, it's
like, no, I was a baby.

335
00:18:58,281 --> 00:18:59,479
I was actually a kid.
- Right.

336
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:02,149
I mean, I think about older
people thinking of what

337
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:05,709
I was doin' back then, just
fuckin' and smoking weed.

338
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,857
- For sure, your parents never
caught you doing that shit?

339
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:10,300
Like, at least your mom did, right?

340
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,500
- But one time, my step
dad caught me in his truck

341
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,068
with this girl and he
beat the shit out of me.

342
00:19:17,118 --> 00:19:19,138
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah, yeah.

343
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:20,425
I mean, they knew I was messin' around,

344
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:23,380
but that was the first time
anybody acknowledged it.

345
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,430
- I'm sorry.

346
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:28,089
- Well, I was used to it by then.

347
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,289
- And you never knew your real dad?

348
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,537
- As well as an
eight-year-old knows anybody.

349
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:39,587
- Is that how old he was
when they got divorced?

350
00:19:40,758 --> 00:19:42,508
- No, they never did.

351
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:46,052
He was hit by a train.

352
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:52,858
- How does that even happen?

353
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:55,948
- By standing in front of it?

354
00:19:55,998 --> 00:19:57,447
- [Alex] Oh.

355
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:58,988
- Yeah.

356
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,319
Well, my mom said it was
a blessing in disguise.

357
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,116
'Cause he wasn't a very happy person,

358
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:07,166
but then again, neither was she, so.

359
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,357
- I'm so sorry.

360
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:12,498
- Don't be.

361
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:15,628
I mean, I turned out all right.

362
00:20:15,678 --> 00:20:16,678
- Oh, god.
- Right, Alex?

363
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:17,788
- Yeah!
- Right?

364
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:20,306
- Yeah, very well adjusted.
- I turned out all right.

365
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:22,205
- (chuckles) Idiot.

366
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:25,005
(Jaime chuckles)

367
00:20:29,884 --> 00:20:30,884
Hey.

368
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:37,793
They're gonna love you.

369
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:49,066
- [Jaime] Your parents are
nothing like you made them seem.

370
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:50,964
- [Alex] I didn't wanna freak you out.

371
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:53,616
- That was some nice light conversation

372
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,749
we had goin' on in there.

373
00:20:56,903 --> 00:21:00,621
I never thought about building a wall

374
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:03,151
at the border of Mexico.
(Alex laughs)

375
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:04,516
I'm sure that'll solve
all of our problems.

376
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,540
- Oh, fuck.

377
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:09,480
I've never spoken to him that way before.

378
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,391
- Yeah, well maybe nobody's
spoken to him like that before.

379
00:21:12,441 --> 00:21:14,024
That's the problem.

380
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:16,911
- That's the problem.

381
00:21:17,938 --> 00:21:19,308
That is definitely their problem.

382
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:21,448
- That's definitely the problem.

383
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:22,498
- Wow.

384
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,210
- What?

385
00:21:26,628 --> 00:21:28,711
So, what do you wanna do?

386
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,638
You wanna go home?

387
00:21:31,688 --> 00:21:32,688
Hm?

388
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,559
- No.

389
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:37,439
Fuck that.

390
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:39,808
I feel too good to go home.

391
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:41,069
- Oh!

392
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,810
You feel too good to go home, hm?

393
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,909
- Mm-hm.

394
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,538
(Jaime chuckles)

395
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:46,588
- Well...

396
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,150
What should we do?

397
00:21:51,866 --> 00:21:52,787
Hm?

398
00:21:52,837 --> 00:21:57,347
(Alex chuckles)
What should we do?

399
00:21:57,397 --> 00:21:58,397

(Jaime chuckles)
Thank you.

418
00:23:14,745 --> 00:23:16,794
- Well, I stretched, ate a banana.

419
00:23:16,844 --> 00:23:18,786
- No, the sex was average.

420
00:23:18,836 --> 00:23:21,407
May have been the most
awkward dinner of my life,

421
00:23:21,457 --> 00:23:23,457
but I'm so proud of you.

422
00:23:26,857 --> 00:23:28,157
- Happy birthday, Alex.

423
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:29,207
- Thank you.

424
00:23:31,668 --> 00:23:34,168
What're we gonna do with that?

425
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:36,917
- Mm, compress it?

426
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:39,954
- Oh, could we make a marinara?

427
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:42,166
- With that?
(Alex chuckles)

428
00:23:42,216 --> 00:23:45,894
- We grew that, bae!
(Jaime chuckles)

429
00:23:45,944 --> 00:23:47,934
- (sighs) You know, it's time to roll.

430
00:23:47,984 --> 00:23:49,835
(Alex moans)
Come on!

431
00:23:49,885 --> 00:23:53,103
I'll make you a special
breakfast for your birthday,

432
00:23:53,153 --> 00:23:55,663
and then take you on a little adventure.

433
00:23:55,713 --> 00:23:57,985
- Where?
- It's a secret adventure.

434
00:23:58,035 --> 00:24:00,646
- I don't like secrets.
- Everyone likes secrets.

435
00:24:00,696 --> 00:24:02,555
- No, no!
- I gotta go.

436
00:24:02,605 --> 00:24:03,388
- Come on!

437
00:24:03,438 --> 00:24:04,811
- [Jaime] I'm goin' to make you breakfast.

438
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:07,465
- It's my birthday! (groans)

439
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:09,825
Is this one of your hangover shakes?

440
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,176
- Well, it's not my daddy issues

441
00:24:11,226 --> 00:24:12,615
we were drinking away last night.

442
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:13,448
- (chuckles) Oh.

443
00:24:13,498 --> 00:24:15,032
- And this will keep you looking young,

444
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:17,446
long after you should be.

445
00:24:17,496 --> 00:24:18,846
- Do I want that?

446
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:20,474
- [Jaime] Everyone wants that.

447
00:24:20,524 --> 00:24:22,806
- [Alex] Oh, wait, can
we not do the raw egg?

448
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:23,639
- Why?

449
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:24,689
It's good for you.

450
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:26,355
Plus, Arnold told me to do it.

451
00:24:26,405 --> 00:24:28,403
- Well, I'm not trying
to be a bodybuilder.

452
00:24:28,453 --> 00:24:29,413
- Do you realize how long it would take

453
00:24:29,463 --> 00:24:32,241
for you to actually look like that?

454
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,744
- Okay, what about salmonella?
- What about it?

455
00:24:34,794 --> 00:24:35,722
- It's in raw eggs!

456
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:39,162
- No, it's in every
20,000 organic raw eggs.

457
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:40,710
- Well...

458
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,139
First, why do you know that?

459
00:24:43,189 --> 00:24:45,249
And second, I don't
wanna take that chance.

460
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:46,837
- Life is the chance.

461
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:48,415
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

462
00:24:48,465 --> 00:24:50,717
Life is the chance of dying.

463
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:53,247
If you wanna be a fucking statician,

464
00:24:53,297 --> 00:24:57,087
your chances of getting
shot to death, one in 325.

465
00:24:57,137 --> 00:25:00,527
Your chances of getting electrocuted,

466
00:25:00,577 --> 00:25:01,660
one in 5,000.

467
00:25:02,865 --> 00:25:05,767
Your chances of getting
killed in a plane crash,

468
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:07,400
also one in 20,000.

469
00:25:09,235 --> 00:25:10,905
So, no going back to Italy for you.

470
00:25:10,955 --> 00:25:14,026
- Okay, okay, we get it, we get it.

471
00:25:14,076 --> 00:25:15,125
(Jaime chuckles)

472
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:17,175
I just like to keep my options open,

473
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:19,975
if that's okay with you.
- It's not okay with me.

474
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:21,081
'Cause that's your problem.

475
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:22,514
You're so busy with the what-ifs,

476
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:23,801
that you're not lookin' at the what-ares.

477
00:25:23,825 --> 00:25:25,895
- Oh, is that my problem?
- That is your problem.

478
00:25:25,945 --> 00:25:28,106
- (chuckles) Oh, thank you for telling me.

479
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:30,255
- Can I put this in the...

480
00:25:30,305 --> 00:25:33,575
- (sighs) Do it.

481
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:37,466
Mm-hm, okay, well, I'm
gonna hop in the shower.

482
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:38,323
Will you please let me know when

483
00:25:38,373 --> 00:25:41,456
my food poisoning shake is available?

484
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,376
- Ah!

Jaime!

My fucking hair dryer.

00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:03,049
- Still have the key?

520
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:05,348

00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:07,905
Balances out my keyring.

522
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:10,759
- All your stuff is in this box.

523
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:12,586
I kept the juicer, because let's face it,

524
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:14,439
you don't really use it.

525
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:16,679
- You know, I uh...

526
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:19,628
I looked up what you yelled
at me out the window.

527
00:29:19,678 --> 00:29:21,337
It's colorful.

528
00:29:21,387 --> 00:29:22,817
- Yeah?
- Bravo, yeah.

529
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:24,665
- Did you have to look
that up in the dictionary,

530
00:29:24,689 --> 00:29:28,546
or did you have to find like
an actual French prostitute?

531
00:29:28,596 --> 00:29:30,857
- You know what, Jaime,
just stop it, okay?

532
00:29:30,907 --> 00:29:33,106
I didn't come here to fight you.

533
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:34,156
God.

534
00:29:36,495 --> 00:29:38,745
(chuckles)

535
00:29:40,334 --> 00:29:42,226
Remember that, huh?

536
00:29:42,276 --> 00:29:43,517
- Yeah.

537
00:29:43,567 --> 00:29:45,146
- I thought you were gonna burn these

538
00:29:45,196 --> 00:29:47,415
in a witch circle or something.

539
00:29:47,465 --> 00:29:51,054
- Look, Alex, I'm not erasing you.

540
00:29:51,104 --> 00:29:55,535
Like I am not pretending
like this never happened.

541
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,146
- But you weren't perfect, either.

542
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:58,797
- Well, no one's perfect, okay?

543
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:00,245
So, you can get over yourself.

544
00:30:00,295 --> 00:30:02,455
- You're just coming at me from ego.

545
00:30:02,505 --> 00:30:05,223
Because you were blind-sighted,
and I get it, it's fine.

546
00:30:05,273 --> 00:30:06,911
But just know that
that's what you're doing.

547
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:09,935
- You could just cut the shit, Alex.

548
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,775
- I love you.

549
00:30:17,825 --> 00:30:18,825
Jaime.

550
00:30:20,455 --> 00:30:21,455
- Really?

551
00:30:21,493 --> 00:30:22,660
- [Alex] Yeah.

552
00:30:26,453 --> 00:30:28,925
- Why do you love me?
- Why do I love you?

553
00:30:28,975 --> 00:30:30,583
- You see, you see? (chuckles)

554
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:32,285
You do that.

555
00:30:32,335 --> 00:30:34,362
You repeat the questions
just so you can like

556
00:30:34,412 --> 00:30:37,426
have more time to think and I hate that.

557
00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:39,241
Why don't you just say
whatever is on your mind?

558
00:30:39,265 --> 00:30:40,583
Just like it's the first
thing that comes out.

559
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:45,607
- Yeah, because your shorts,
they're cute and they're tight.

560
00:30:47,385 --> 00:30:48,734
- That's really romantic, Alex.

561
00:30:48,784 --> 00:30:50,386
- Yeah, okay, sorry.

562
00:30:50,436 --> 00:30:52,895
Just give me a second!
- Okay, just ask me.

563
00:30:52,945 --> 00:30:54,195
- Ask you?
- Mm.

564
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:58,787
- (chuckles) Right, okay.

565
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:03,494
So, why do you love me?

566
00:31:03,544 --> 00:31:05,377
- You're my nightmare.

567
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:11,263
After I met you, my fears of
snakes and spiders and heights,

568
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:15,082
they just seemed so childish
compared to my fear of you with

569
00:31:15,132 --> 00:31:16,215
someone else.

570
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:19,023
And then...

571
00:31:20,652 --> 00:31:22,100
I saw what you did.

572
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,392
And I realized that we
don't share the same fear.

573
00:31:25,442 --> 00:31:27,629
- That is not fair.
- Okay.

574
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,988
- What, do you think you're so smart,

575
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,922
interpreting what I was doing?

576
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,380
Analyzing that somehow
my definition of love

577
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,068
is inferior to yours?
- I didn't say that.

578
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:37,629
- Yeah, but you think it, Jaime!

579
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,519
You think, "oh, I wouldn't
have done anything like that,"

580
00:31:39,543 --> 00:31:42,082
because your feelings are
so much more pure and noble.

581
00:31:42,132 --> 00:31:43,437
- Oh, fuck yeah!

582
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:44,783
- You didn't think that
you were gonna have to put

583
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:46,165
any more work into this relationship?

584
00:31:46,189 --> 00:31:48,608
- Holy shit, oh, right.
- Yeah, you say, no, look.

585
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:50,789
You say that you love me.

586
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:53,629
You say that you're afraid of losing me.

587
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,229
And now what?

588
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,819
You're done?
- Look, I put in work, okay?

589
00:31:57,869 --> 00:32:00,717
I changed my fucking work
schedule to fit yours.

590
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:02,757
I cook for you, I clean for you.

591
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:04,669
I chose to spend time with you.

592
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:08,456
- Okay, you know what? God
damn, spending time is not work.

593
00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:09,557
That is the good part.

594
00:32:09,607 --> 00:32:12,236
The real work in a relationship
is the exhausting practice

595
00:32:12,286 --> 00:32:13,725
of working through the
little shit that you hate

596
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:17,189
about each other and trust me,
Jaime, I have done the work.

597
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:18,606
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.

598
00:32:18,656 --> 00:32:19,823
- Okay.
- Yeah.

599
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:25,447
What I did shouldn't be
a no-going-back mistake.

600
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:27,863
- I think it's a matter of opinion.

601
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:29,669
- It's completely irrational.

602
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:30,840
The way that you were
treating me and the way...

603
00:32:30,864 --> 00:32:32,081
- [Jaime] Oh, this is
your fucking phone now.

604
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:35,772
- My phone, what...
- Yes, your fucking phone!

605
00:32:41,384 --> 00:32:44,015
You know, on that one thing,

606
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:49,065
there are 1,000 different
ways for you to cheat on me.

607
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:51,068
And I hate that thing.

608
00:32:52,082 --> 00:32:54,204
Every time you are on it, I am wondering,

609
00:32:54,254 --> 00:32:57,175
who the fuck are you talking to?

610
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,993
Who are you setting up
your next fuck date with?

611
00:33:00,043 --> 00:33:01,465
- That's not what I was doing!

612
00:33:01,515 --> 00:33:03,273
- [Jaime] Okay, if only
I could believe you.

613
00:33:03,323 --> 00:33:04,106
- Oh.

614
00:33:04,156 --> 00:33:06,281
- If the only thing I
had to worry about was

615
00:33:06,331 --> 00:33:07,828
what you were doing when I wasn't around,

616
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,692
I mean, that is one thing.

617
00:33:10,742 --> 00:33:12,325
But what you did...

618
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:17,000
You were five feet away from me.

619
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,463
- I was just talking.

620
00:33:19,513 --> 00:33:22,073
Okay? I was just talking.

621
00:33:22,123 --> 00:33:23,240
I wasn't...

622
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:28,040
- I am sorry that I am, I want
more in my life, Alex, I do.

623
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,400
I am not obligated to stay
in this rent-controlled

624
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,069
rat box forever, just
because I lowered myself

625
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:37,050
to your fucking standards!
- That is so fucked up.

626
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,120
My standards are me.
- No.

627
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,069
- Jaime, no, my standards are me.

628
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,587
- [Jaime] Do not get this twisted.

629
00:33:44,637 --> 00:33:46,240
- Hey, you know, why don't you go fuck

630
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,818
one of your little rich buddies?

631
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:50,978
You know, and see if they'll
give the life that you wanted.

632
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,028
Hm, Jaime?

633
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,501
You know, I'm sorry that I am not sorry,

634
00:33:56,551 --> 00:33:59,946
but that shit doesn't matter to me.

635
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:04,496
This whole little tough girl
act, I know it's not you.

636
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:11,811
And that you're just acting
tough so that this hurts less.

637
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:17,938
So let's just stop, okay?

638
00:34:17,988 --> 00:34:21,655
- You know, the only
comfort I have in this,

639
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:27,080
is knowing that you're
gonna hurt a lot worse.

640
00:34:29,727 --> 00:34:30,727
- I'm sorry.

641
00:34:34,036 --> 00:34:36,036
All right? I was scared.

642
00:34:38,204 --> 00:34:42,037
I was scared, baby, I
didn't, come on, please.

643
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,313
What if our flag...

644
00:34:54,221 --> 00:34:55,221
- Hey.

645
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:59,454
Leave my key on the table, all right?

646
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:19,954
(Alex chuckles)

647
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:33,028

- Me, I'm a-Mark, Mark, my name's Mark.

720
00:42:43,617 --> 00:42:46,390
I'm the wine rep from West
Wines, are you the owner?

721
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,440
- Not yet.

722
00:42:48,286 --> 00:42:50,340
- Is she here or...

723
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,390
- Nope.

724
00:42:55,269 --> 00:42:57,158
- What do you do?

725
00:42:57,208 --> 00:43:01,009
- The chef de cuisine.
- Ah, very nice, very nice.

726
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:04,726
Well, what do you say
there, chef du cosine?

727
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,543
Can I buy you a drink?

728
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,903
- You, uh, you smell real good.

729
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,573
You like a flower, you know?

730
00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:22,758
Like a really nice-smelling flower?

731
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,837
- Hm.
- You heard that before?

732
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:28,089
- Oh, I'm sorry, that was my partner.

733
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:32,110
My figure skating
partner, he's gay, though.

734
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,150
I'm a figure skater. (chuckles)

735
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,340
- Really?
- Yeah!

736
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,500
I mean, I'm not a professional, but,

737
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,979
I've been doing it since I
was nine, so I'm pretty good.

738
00:43:40,029 --> 00:43:41,619
But you know, the glory days of skating

739
00:43:41,669 --> 00:43:43,757
were really in the 90s.

740
00:43:43,807 --> 00:43:46,310
We didn't have a TV, but my
mom's friend recorded like

741
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,558
every single Winter Olympics from 1980s.

742
00:43:49,608 --> 00:43:52,929
So I would just watch them like
over and over and over again

743
00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:55,678
and my favorite was Nancy Kerrigan.

744
00:43:55,728 --> 00:43:59,668
- Oh, she was the best.
- She was the best!

745
00:43:59,718 --> 00:44:03,100
Aww, yeah, oh my god, I
just do it now because

746
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:07,689
I wanna stay in shape, plus
the outfits, they're amazing.

747
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:09,009
- Totally amazing.
- Yeah!

748
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:11,198
- The most amazing.

749
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,068
Tonya Harding was my favorite, though.

750
00:44:13,118 --> 00:44:17,701
She really brought the
competition down to their knees.

751
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:21,444
- Wait, that's not funny.

752
00:44:21,494 --> 00:44:24,494
She was amazing, but she had demons.

753
00:44:26,966 --> 00:44:30,126
Wait, are you saying
that because you think

754
00:44:30,176 --> 00:44:32,625
that you're funny or are you saying it

755
00:44:32,675 --> 00:44:36,515
to try to feign interest so
that I'll sleep with you?

756
00:44:36,565 --> 00:44:41,398
- Would you be mad if I was
just trying to sleep with you?

757
00:44:42,256 --> 00:44:44,839
- Probably not, but, oh my god.

758
00:44:45,744 --> 00:44:47,905
Let me tell you about the French judges.

759
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:49,596
Don't even get me started.

760
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:52,854
They are just so much, I just hate them.

761
00:44:52,904 --> 00:44:54,544
Oh my god, there's this one named Pierre.

762
00:44:54,584 --> 00:44:56,025
He is just, I just, oh my god.

763
00:44:56,075 --> 00:44:59,992
- What was Pierre like?
- Don't even get me, oh.

764
00:45:02,443 --> 00:45:05,423
- Sorry, I'm just getting
a Snapchat from my sensei.

765
00:45:05,473 --> 00:45:08,815
(chuckles) I was training hard last night.

766
00:45:08,865 --> 00:45:09,865
- Oh.

767
00:45:10,985 --> 00:45:12,485
What belt are you?

768
00:45:13,465 --> 00:45:15,723
- There are no belts
in Muay Thai, actually.

769
00:45:15,773 --> 00:45:17,833
That is a common misconception.

770
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:20,215
Muay Thai is more of a dance.

771
00:45:20,265 --> 00:45:23,762
It's beautiful, but it's also very deadly.

772
00:45:23,812 --> 00:45:27,061
It's violent, but I'm not
training in it so I can kick

773
00:45:27,111 --> 00:45:29,482
some random guy's ass on the
street, even though I could.

774
00:45:29,532 --> 00:45:31,141
I could.
- Sure, yeah.

775
00:45:31,191 --> 00:45:33,010
Great, that's good.

776
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,458
- But it's an art form and
the Thai history is very rich.

777
00:45:37,508 --> 00:45:40,749
Have you ever seen the movie Ong-Bak?

778
00:45:40,799 --> 00:45:43,186
- What was that?
- Ong-Bak.

779
00:45:43,236 --> 00:45:44,359
Ong-Bak.

780
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,050
Thai movie, Tony Jaa?

781
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,309
- No.
- Man.

782
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,775
- No, I don't think so.
- Yeah, am I boring you?

783
00:45:49,825 --> 00:45:52,178
- No, no, not at all.
- Okay.

784
00:45:52,228 --> 00:45:56,258
He's this Thai actor,
super sick martial artist.

785
00:45:56,308 --> 00:46:01,308
And this whole thing is like,
here, watch, I'll show you.

786
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:02,978
So. (clears throat)

787
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:04,919
- Oh, (chuckles) okay.

788
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:06,052
- Come at me.

789
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:08,356
- I'm sorry, you want me to come at...

790
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,199
- Come at me.

791
00:46:10,249 --> 00:46:12,439
- (chuckles) I don't think...
- Just stand up.

792
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:15,239
- Oh, no, no thanks.
- Come at me.

793
00:46:16,081 --> 00:46:18,650
Just come at me.
- That's okay.

794
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,119
- Come at me, bro.
- I don't think so, not today.

795
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:23,890
It's more a second date type thing.

796
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,199
- Oh, you're saying you
wanna go on a second date?

797
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:28,469
(Alex chuckles)
Yes?

798
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:29,519
It worked!

799
00:46:30,266 --> 00:46:31,509
It worked.

800
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:34,210
- Those Muay Thai moves.
- Welcome to my world.

801
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,218
(Alex chuckles)

802
00:46:36,268 --> 00:46:38,601
Well, cheers to that.
- Yeah.

803
00:46:46,364 --> 00:46:47,364
- Hey, Alex.

804
00:46:48,826 --> 00:46:51,342
I'm not calling to beg for
you back, or to say that I was

805
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,512
wrong or that you were wrong
or anything crazy like that.

806
00:46:53,536 --> 00:46:56,619
I just, I took a little trip, and um,

807
00:46:58,136 --> 00:47:01,075
I just, I see things clearer now.

808
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:05,646
If you wanna give me a ring,
you know, to talk things out,

809
00:47:05,696 --> 00:47:09,475
or to get anything off your
chest or whatever, I'm here.

810
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:12,583
And, um, yeah, so give me
a ring, give me a ring,

811
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:15,216
and then we'll, uh, we'll chat.

812
00:47:16,565 --> 00:47:17,785
Okay.

813
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:22,085

837
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:40,907
Yeah, mine's into Muay Thai boxing.

838
00:48:40,957 --> 00:48:44,124
It's very bad ass, very intense and...

839
00:48:45,664 --> 00:48:46,718
You know.

840
00:48:46,768 --> 00:48:48,088
- That's very dangerous of you.

841
00:48:48,138 --> 00:48:49,305
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

842
00:48:50,538 --> 00:48:54,017
- Mine's a figure skater.
- Oh, wow.

843
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:56,177
- She's very flexible.
- Okay. (chuckles)

844
00:48:56,227 --> 00:48:57,310
Where is she?

845
00:48:58,747 --> 00:49:00,002
- She's, uh, she's grabbing some dinner.

846
00:49:00,026 --> 00:49:01,838
- She right there? Yeah.

847
00:49:01,888 --> 00:49:04,638
- [Jaime] She's a hell of a cook.

848
00:49:05,499 --> 00:49:06,625
- What do you want, Jaime?

849
00:49:06,675 --> 00:49:08,258
- I just want, I...

850
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:11,257
I wanted to tell you that I forgive you

851
00:49:11,307 --> 00:49:14,065
for everything that happened, okay?

852
00:49:14,115 --> 00:49:16,705
And that it's okay that
we're apart right now.

853
00:49:16,755 --> 00:49:18,723
(clears throat) Awesome.
- Yeah, excellent.

854
00:49:18,773 --> 00:49:20,856
- Wonderful, fuck.
- Fuck.

855
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:29,673
- [Mark] Sorry about that,
my mom's goin' nutty today.

856
00:49:34,692 --> 00:49:35,995
What's up?

857
00:49:36,045 --> 00:49:37,295
- This is Mark.

858
00:49:38,285 --> 00:49:39,368
- Jaime.
- Hi.

859
00:49:40,285 --> 00:49:41,363
Hi, Jaime.
- Pleasure.

860
00:49:41,413 --> 00:49:43,665
- How are you?
- I'm well.

861
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:44,715
- Well.
- Hi!

862
00:49:46,555 --> 00:49:49,585
- And this is Missy, Missy, this is Alex.

863
00:49:49,635 --> 00:49:51,523
Alex, Missy.
- Hi, Missy.

864
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:53,894
- Missy, Mark.
- Hi, Missy.

865
00:49:53,944 --> 00:49:56,275
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

866
00:49:56,325 --> 00:49:58,843
- My god, you're so pretty.
- Oh, thanks!

867
00:49:58,893 --> 00:49:59,893
- Yeah.

868
00:50:01,224 --> 00:50:02,705
It was crazy running into you,

869
00:50:02,755 --> 00:50:03,603
but I actually think
that we have to leave.

870
00:50:03,653 --> 00:50:06,903
- Wait, how do you two know each other?

871
00:50:09,133 --> 00:50:11,300
- We stole a tomato plant.

872
00:50:12,173 --> 00:50:13,833
- Mm-hm and an American flag.

873
00:50:13,883 --> 00:50:16,534
- And an American flag.
- Gangsters.

874
00:50:16,584 --> 00:50:18,593
You guys remind me of my punk rock days.

875
00:50:18,643 --> 00:50:20,683
- You were not punk rock.
- I am so punk.

876
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:22,380
I used to have blue hair, I swear to god.

877
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:24,214
- Wait, you guys were like crazy?

878
00:50:24,264 --> 00:50:25,820
Were you like crazy teenagers?

879
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:28,245
- No, we weren't crazy teenagers.

880
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:30,074
- It was last year.
- Yeah.

881
00:50:30,124 --> 00:50:32,354
- Yeah, nope, totally
used to be punk rock.

882
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,331
I was all into NOFX until they sold out.

883
00:50:35,381 --> 00:50:37,773
But I still steal stuff from Walmart.

884
00:50:37,823 --> 00:50:40,423
- That's hard, that's
super hardcore, dude.

885
00:50:40,473 --> 00:50:43,474
(Alex chuckles)

886
00:50:43,524 --> 00:50:45,245
- We should go though, right?

887
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:47,502
- Yeah, we're making spaghetti squash.

888
00:50:47,552 --> 00:50:49,262
He's trying to cut back on carbs.

889
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,015
- Aww, dieting?

890
00:50:51,065 --> 00:50:51,954
- No.

891
00:50:52,004 --> 00:50:53,285
- It sounds like you're dieting.

892
00:50:53,335 --> 00:50:54,460
- I'm not dieting.
- That's good.

893
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:55,591
- I'm not dieting.
- It's good for you.

894
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:58,381
- It's a sweet squash, bro.
- Yeah, sweet squash, bro.

895
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,462
- Thanks, bro.
- I do Muay Thai.

896
00:51:00,512 --> 00:51:02,895
- Oh, I'm an athlete too, I figure skate!

897
00:51:02,945 --> 00:51:04,095
- Really?
- Yeah!

898
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:05,583
- Solid, solid.
- I can tell.

899
00:51:05,633 --> 00:51:09,152

I take this ring as a sign of my love.

909
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,440
- I take this ring as a sign of my love.

910
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:01,792
- And as a symbol that we all share.

911
00:52:01,842 --> 00:52:04,440
- And a symbol that we all share.

912
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:06,278

00:52:08,848 --> 00:52:11,410
- Of my constant faith and abiding love.

915
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:15,101
- Of my constant faith and abiding love.

916
00:52:15,151 --> 00:52:16,951
- Exchange your vows.

917
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:19,751
- Oh. (chuckles)

918
00:52:21,448 --> 00:52:22,640
(clears throat)

919
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,773
Jaime, I must confess, I,

920
00:52:25,831 --> 00:52:28,278
kind of wrote these vows this morning.

921
00:52:28,328 --> 00:52:30,240
(clears throat)

922
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,218
You always say that the
first time I try something,

923
00:52:32,242 --> 00:52:36,159
I usually screw it up
and you're usually right.

924
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:40,239
But I got this one thing right.

925
00:52:40,289 --> 00:52:42,320
I usually try to play the cynic and find

926
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:46,520
whatever's wrong with
the situation, but now,

927
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:50,120
this one time, I can't
find anything wrong,

928
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,087
because you're perfect.

929
00:52:55,168 --> 00:52:58,751
And I vow to always
wave our flag together.

930
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:02,311
To rob racists together.

931
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,513
To plant our seeds together.

932
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:08,530
And with my whole heart,

933
00:53:10,121 --> 00:53:12,238
I vow to always be
grateful that I get to be

934
00:53:12,288 --> 00:53:16,205
the one that brushes your
hair behind your ear.

935
00:53:17,089 --> 00:53:18,089
I love you.

936
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,090
- I vow to support your dreams,

937
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,890
however outlandish they may seem.

938
00:53:30,551 --> 00:53:34,941
I vow to make you smoothies
when you are tired from cooking,

939
00:53:34,991 --> 00:53:37,751
and keep the statistics on the hold.

940
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:40,911
I vow to be your rock
when the tides are high,

941
00:53:40,961 --> 00:53:43,711
and your oak when the sun is hot.

942
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:48,703
And your willow when the storms roll in.

943
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,010
- Hey!

944
00:53:51,889 --> 00:53:53,261
What the hell?

945
00:53:53,311 --> 00:53:55,227
- Run, run!
- Run!

946
00:53:55,277 --> 00:53:56,781
- I told y'all twice already!

947
00:53:56,831 --> 00:54:01,021
(elevator dings)
(elevator music)

948
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,821
(group chuckles)

949
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,020
- Whoa!

950
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:11,021
- I vow to not get you arrested.

951
00:54:11,071 --> 00:54:13,821
(group chuckles)

952
00:54:25,734 --> 00:54:27,415
Okay, okay, okay.

953
00:54:27,465 --> 00:54:29,632
(giggles)

954
00:54:31,577 --> 00:54:36,327
- I need to make it official,
I need to make it official.

955
00:54:37,356 --> 00:54:40,287
Okay, the acceptance of the
offering of their families

956
00:54:40,337 --> 00:54:41,758
that you have each other and the blessings

957
00:54:41,782 --> 00:54:44,946
of all these good people
here with us today.

958
00:54:44,996 --> 00:54:48,146
(group chuckles)

959
00:54:48,196 --> 00:54:50,815
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

960
00:54:50,865 --> 00:54:51,865
Kiss.

961
00:54:54,356 --> 00:54:55,527
Good.

962
00:54:55,577 --> 00:54:59,327
(peaceful atmospheric music)

963
00:55:01,556 --> 00:55:05,207
- Oh, it's time to go.

(Alex chuckles)

984
00:56:55,266 --> 00:56:57,598
- [Jaime] Ah. (chuckles)

985
00:56:57,648 --> 00:56:58,996
Yeah.

986
00:56:59,046 --> 00:57:01,056
The muscovado was a mistake.

987
00:57:01,106 --> 00:57:05,068
- I think the third cotton
candy was actually the mistake.

988
00:57:05,118 --> 00:57:07,358
- Cheaper than a
four-tier German chocolate

989
00:57:07,408 --> 00:57:10,491
from Decadent Designs for 120 people.

990
00:57:11,766 --> 00:57:16,046
- (groans) Yeah, my
mom's gonna be so pissed.

991
00:57:16,096 --> 00:57:17,196
- Totally.

992
00:57:17,246 --> 00:57:19,537
She just inherited a
completely ungrateful,

993
00:57:19,587 --> 00:57:22,188
disrespectful, pain-in-the-ass daughter.

994
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:24,837
And she doesn't even know it.

995
00:57:24,887 --> 00:57:26,878
- Such a good pain in
the ass to have, though.

996
00:57:26,928 --> 00:57:27,788
- Aww.

997
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:31,786
It only took you three-fourths
of a decade to figure it out!

998
00:57:31,836 --> 00:57:35,977
- Yeah. (chuckles)
(Jaime chuckles)

999
00:57:36,027 --> 00:57:37,486
Thank you.

1000
00:57:37,536 --> 00:57:38,953
- You're welcome.

1001
00:57:39,867 --> 00:57:40,867
For what?

1002
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:47,147
- For being cool with this whole thing.

1003
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,548
- Well, there was nobody
to pay a dowry to,

1004
00:57:49,598 --> 00:57:51,726
so your family can keep the goats.

1005
00:57:51,776 --> 00:57:54,443
(Alex chuckles)

1006
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,720
- I mean for everything.

1007
00:58:00,656 --> 00:58:01,656
- I know.

1008
00:58:05,098 --> 00:58:06,925
- And I swear to you,
one day I'm gonna get you

1009
00:58:06,949 --> 00:58:09,659
that four-tier Decadent Design cake.

1010
00:58:09,709 --> 00:58:12,307
I'm gonna get you the
four-course sea bass.

1011
00:58:12,357 --> 00:58:13,528
I'm gonna get you the DJ

1012
00:58:13,578 --> 00:58:15,368
who plays way too much Village People.

1013
00:58:15,418 --> 00:58:16,835
- It was perfect.

1014
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:20,598
- It was fun.

1015
00:58:20,648 --> 00:58:21,967
- Mm-hm.

1016
00:58:22,017 --> 00:58:25,936
- It was perfect, it was
just, it was novel, all right?

1017
00:58:25,986 --> 00:58:28,947
Someday I just wanna get you the...

1018
00:58:28,997 --> 00:58:29,997
- Stop.

1019
00:58:31,185 --> 00:58:36,185
You're not my fairy godmother,
this is the 21st century.

1020
00:58:36,386 --> 00:58:37,386
- Yeah.

1021
00:58:41,328 --> 00:58:43,707
(sighs)

1022
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:47,296
You know, I used to have
to cater these, like,

1023
00:58:47,346 --> 00:58:48,846
$100,000 weddings.

1024
00:58:49,886 --> 00:58:51,719
Cooking for everybody.

1025
00:58:52,727 --> 00:58:54,827
And I used to think what a ridiculous,

1026
00:58:54,877 --> 00:58:58,794
extravagant waste of
money they were, but also,

1027
00:59:00,418 --> 00:59:01,714
I always thought that I was gonna waste

1028
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:04,356
that money on somebody, someday.

1029
00:59:04,406 --> 00:59:07,157
- You also thought that
marriage was an outdated

1030
00:59:07,207 --> 00:59:10,638
and idiotic institution
designed to make women property.

1031
00:59:10,688 --> 00:59:11,796
- Well, they are.

1032
00:59:11,846 --> 00:59:13,307
(Jaime chuckles)
So, you're mine now.

1033
00:59:13,357 --> 00:59:15,940
(both chuckle)

1034
00:59:16,997 --> 00:59:19,566
(sighs)

1035
00:59:19,616 --> 00:59:22,187
I have no idea what we're gonna do.

1036
00:59:22,237 --> 00:59:26,358
- Well, we are at least
bound legally now, so,

1037
00:59:26,408 --> 00:59:29,576
no matter what happens,
if one of us succeeds,

1038
00:59:29,626 --> 00:59:31,779
the other will get something.

1039
00:59:31,829 --> 00:59:33,528
- I like the way your mind works.

1040
00:59:33,578 --> 00:59:34,578
- Yeah.

1041
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:37,830
(Alex chuckles)

1042
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,390
- Oh.

1043
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,219
I know we weren't supposed
to do presents or anything,

1044
00:59:42,269 --> 00:59:43,758
but I got you a little something.

1045
00:59:43,808 --> 00:59:44,950
- You're breaking the rules.

1046
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,737
- It's really small, just take it.

1047
00:59:47,787 --> 00:59:50,077
- [Jaime] Oh, it's beautiful.

1048
00:59:50,127 --> 00:59:52,986
- It was my grandmother's.

1049
00:59:53,036 --> 00:59:55,729
It was her St. Matthew's pendant.

1050
00:59:55,779 --> 00:59:58,689
We weren't religious or anything, but,

1051
00:59:58,739 --> 01:00:01,748
she always thought it had magical
powers that kept her safe,

1052
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:02,798
and I...

1053
01:00:04,078 --> 01:00:07,911
I liked the idea of you
always being safe, so.

1054
01:00:09,369 --> 01:00:12,197
- So, what is he, like, the patron saint

1055
01:00:12,247 --> 01:00:14,809
of protection, or love or...

1056
01:00:14,859 --> 01:00:15,942
- Accounting.

1057
01:00:16,918 --> 01:00:20,108
(both laugh)

1058
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:24,348
Apparently, he was the
Jewish tax collector

1059
01:00:24,398 --> 01:00:26,497
who worked for the Romans.

1060
01:00:26,547 --> 01:00:31,417
Grams never knew that, I just
let her live in ignorance.

1061
01:00:31,467 --> 01:00:34,767
- Got a St. Matthew, the
Internal Revenue Saint.

1062
01:00:34,817 --> 01:00:37,297
(both chuckle)

1063
01:00:37,347 --> 01:00:39,977
- Don't go convertin' on me.

1064
01:00:40,027 --> 01:00:41,647
- I love it, thank you.

1065
01:00:41,697 --> 01:00:44,457
- [Alex] I'm glad you like it.

1066
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:48,756
- So, as long as we are
already on that subject,

1067
01:00:48,806 --> 01:00:51,145
I got you something too.

1068
01:00:51,195 --> 01:00:53,876
- (gasps) You're breaking the rules too?

1069
01:00:53,926 --> 01:00:55,596
- Birds of a feather.

1070
01:00:55,646 --> 01:00:56,646
- Hm.
- Here.

1071
01:00:58,945 --> 01:00:59,945
- Aww.

1072
01:01:01,595 --> 01:01:03,505
Thought I already had
the key to your heart?

1073
01:01:03,555 --> 01:01:05,113
- I will drown you in the ocean right now,

1074
01:01:05,137 --> 01:01:07,165
you cheesy bastard.

1075
01:01:07,215 --> 01:01:08,245
- Sorry.

1076
01:01:08,295 --> 01:01:09,807
Key to the dog house, got it.

1077
01:01:09,857 --> 01:01:13,524
- No, it's to a run-down
shack on Mar Vista.

1078
01:01:15,326 --> 01:01:17,245
- You're gonna keep me that far away now?

1079
01:01:17,295 --> 01:01:18,295
- No.

1080
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,884
It's the old Husure.

1081
01:01:25,587 --> 01:01:27,766
- The one that we were looking at?

1082
01:01:27,816 --> 01:01:28,816
- Yeah.

1083
01:01:31,886 --> 01:01:33,196
- Oh, my god.

1084
01:01:33,246 --> 01:01:36,996
- It's gonna need some
work, but, it's yours.

1085
01:01:41,987 --> 01:01:43,820
- My restaurant?
- Yes.

1086
01:01:48,347 --> 01:01:51,914
- No, but we looked at
it, we can't afford it.

1087
01:01:51,964 --> 01:01:54,881
- I might have pulled some strings.

1088
01:01:56,775 --> 01:01:57,775
- What strings?

1089
01:01:57,806 --> 01:01:59,377
It was gonna be like four years

1090
01:01:59,427 --> 01:02:00,993
before we had a down payment, we can't...

1091
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,756
- Maybe I took out a couple of loans,

1092
01:02:03,806 --> 01:02:07,056
and we may have to move into the attic,

1093
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:11,656
and I may have told your dad
it was for a real wedding.

1094
01:02:11,706 --> 01:02:13,806
(Alex chuckles)

1095
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:15,523
- You lied to Roger?

1096
01:02:18,307 --> 01:02:19,635
He's gonna be furious.

1097
01:02:19,685 --> 01:02:20,937
- He deserves it.

1098
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,320
- He so deserves it.
- Mm-hm.

1099
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:27,392
(Alex sighs)

1100
01:02:29,035 --> 01:02:30,452
I believe in you.

1101
01:02:34,275 --> 01:02:35,275
- Thank you.

1102
01:02:36,897 --> 01:02:37,897
Thank you.

1103
01:02:40,366 --> 01:02:41,977
- Alex.

1104
01:02:42,027 --> 01:02:43,255
- [Alex] Yeah.

1105
01:02:43,305 --> 01:02:47,087
- We still have to have
our first official dance.

1106
01:02:47,137 --> 01:02:49,207
- But we had it with Mr. Dance-A-Thon.

1107
01:02:49,257 --> 01:02:53,545
- [Jaime] No, like the slow
kind, silly. (chuckles)

1108
01:02:53,595 --> 01:02:55,845
- Okay, are you gonna sing?

1109
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:58,944
- Get your phone, come on.

- Just a minute, please.

1125
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,861
- Jaime, they're ready for you now.

1126
01:04:18,911 --> 01:04:20,244
- Just a minute.

1127
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:33,455
- It's five minutes.

1128
01:04:33,505 --> 01:04:37,422
It'll be over and you
can leave, I'll clean up.

1129

(Jaime sighs)

1130
01:04:45,657 --> 01:04:49,657
- If there's fucking sub
sandwiches out there...

1131
01:04:51,017 --> 01:04:52,934
Alex would be appalled.

1132
01:04:57,224 --> 01:04:59,473
- "Plebeian food."

1133
01:04:59,523 --> 01:05:03,690
Maybe you have been spoiled
for the last 20 years.

1134
01:05:05,323 --> 01:05:07,615
This is how we do it, Jaime.

1135
01:05:07,665 --> 01:05:10,325
We get up, we put on our faces,

1136
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:13,625
and we go and do what needs to be done.

1137
01:05:15,425 --> 01:05:17,626
- I don't know half
those people out there.

1138
01:05:17,676 --> 01:05:20,259
- [Woman] Well, they knew Alex.

1139
01:05:24,444 --> 01:05:25,694
- I don't care.

1140
01:05:28,415 --> 01:05:30,245
(sighs)

1141
01:05:30,295 --> 01:05:31,962
- Alex was my child.

1142
01:05:34,053 --> 01:05:36,470
Long before you were married.

1143
01:05:37,575 --> 01:05:41,408
You don't have exclusive
rights to this grief.

1144
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:45,232
And neither do I.

1145
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:47,734
We share this.

1146
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:50,737
And so do they.

1147
01:05:54,577 --> 01:05:55,577
Now.

1148
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:58,911
If my memory's correct...

1149
01:06:00,468 --> 01:06:02,718
You have a promise to keep.

1150
01:06:06,977 --> 01:06:08,469
- It's gonna be so bad.

- Alex, my love.

1156
01:06:47,245 --> 01:06:50,078
The award-winning culinary artist,

1157
01:06:51,367 --> 01:06:53,284
was a fiery sex puppet.

1158
01:06:54,999 --> 01:06:58,195
Because of his natural athleticism,

1159
01:06:58,245 --> 01:07:00,788
he was simply out of my control.

1160
01:07:00,838 --> 01:07:02,921
(laughs)

1161
01:07:07,287 --> 01:07:10,686
Alex's sex life was lived
outside of the bedroom.

1162
01:07:10,736 --> 01:07:13,378
In the living room as
well, and the garden,

1163
01:07:13,428 --> 01:07:16,178
where you are all gathered today.

1164
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:21,877
Everything he did when it came to work,

1165
01:07:21,927 --> 01:07:24,755
or that one half of a half-marathon,

1166
01:07:24,805 --> 01:07:27,669
beginner's swing dancing,
not paying bills on time,

1167
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:31,357
knowing what offsides means in football,

1168
01:07:31,407 --> 01:07:35,824
and not being a cheating
asshole like his dad, Roger.

1169
01:07:39,068 --> 01:07:42,677
He did what he wanted
without fear of failure,

1170
01:07:42,727 --> 01:07:45,877
and did it well, a true bad ass.

1171
01:07:45,927 --> 01:07:47,355
(chuckles)

1172
01:07:47,405 --> 01:07:48,988
I loved Alex madly.

1173
01:07:52,367 --> 01:07:53,867
I worshiped the...

1174
01:08:04,137 --> 01:08:05,720
I loved Alex madly.

1175
01:08:09,657 --> 01:08:13,324
I worshiped the ground
my husband walked on.

1176
01:08:15,047 --> 01:08:17,630
He truly just wanted one thing.

1177
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:21,426
He wanted to make sure I, Jaime,

1178
01:08:23,678 --> 01:08:26,511
knew how much love he felt for me,

1179
01:08:27,959 --> 01:08:32,459
and the infinite amount of
love he tried to give back.

1180
01:08:35,724 --> 01:08:38,237
He wanted me to know how
beautiful the world became

1181
01:08:38,287 --> 01:08:40,870
when he saw it through my eyes.

1182
01:08:42,937 --> 01:08:46,687
And how he will be
forever grateful for that.

1183
01:08:50,028 --> 01:08:51,389
So, there you have it.

1184
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:54,439
Alex, one boss, hot-as-hell bad ass,

1185
01:08:56,468 --> 01:09:00,718
brilliant bombshell minx,
who should've been a spy.

1186
01:09:04,525 --> 01:09:09,525
Also, global warming is real,
Roger, stop being a dick.

1187
01:09:09,857 --> 01:09:12,717
Hashtag best eulogy ever.

01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:15,238

I am gonna regret this decision.

1201
01:10:01,158 --> 01:10:03,198
- No, you can't look.

1202

That's the whole deal, not

1205
01:10:10,798 --> 01:10:12,457
- Yes, it is.

1206
01:10:12,507 --> 01:10:15,077
You're afraid of me in real
life, just wait till I'm a tree

1207
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:17,844
or a supernatural being or something.

- [Jaime] Fine.

1211
01:10:26,534 --> 01:10:29,404
- Hey, Barb, how do you spell ejaculate?

1212
01:10:29,454 --> 01:10:30,454
- What?

1213
01:10:31,128 --> 01:10:32,478
- I'm kidding.

1214
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:33,528
Calm down!

1215
01:10:35,008 --> 01:10:36,175
Maybe kidding.

1216
01:10:37,056 --> 01:10:39,558
(Jaime chuckles)

1217
01:10:39,608 --> 01:10:42,037
- I'm gonna take off for the night.

1218
01:10:42,087 --> 01:10:43,765
You guys okay?

1219
01:10:43,815 --> 01:10:45,148
- I have cancer.

1220
01:10:46,616 --> 01:10:48,118
- Hey, Alex.

1221
01:10:48,168 --> 01:10:49,238
Thanks, Barb.

1222
01:10:49,288 --> 01:10:51,788
Sorry about...

1224
01:10:56,467 --> 01:10:58,445
- Alex?
- Mm, yeah.

1225
01:10:58,495 --> 01:11:00,798
- E-J-A-C-U-L-A-T-E.

1226
01:11:00,848 --> 01:11:03,918
- [Jaime] Not funny,
Barb, not funny at all.

1227
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:06,198
- I actually don't like that word.

1228
01:11:06,248 --> 01:11:08,604
Think I'll avoid it.

1229
01:11:08,654 --> 01:11:09,654
Lucky.

1230
01:11:15,715 --> 01:11:16,946
(Jaime sighs)

1231
01:11:16,996 --> 01:11:19,579
- So, you've been goin' for a while now.

1232
01:11:19,629 --> 01:11:21,668
How long am I gonna be up there for?

1233
01:11:21,718 --> 01:11:24,885
- I don't know, this is a first draft.

1234
01:11:27,305 --> 01:11:29,057
- Do you wanna invite your dad?

1235
01:11:29,107 --> 01:11:32,777
- Oh, yeah, make sure
he's there. (chuckles)

1236
01:11:32,827 --> 01:11:34,994
- Okay, it's your funeral.

1237
01:11:36,747 --> 01:11:38,664
- Good one.
- Thank you.

1238
01:11:42,747 --> 01:11:46,164
How are you feeling?
- I'm a little tired.

1239
01:11:47,145 --> 01:11:49,817
- Maybe you should, uh...

1240
01:11:49,867 --> 01:11:53,867
- No, not yet, I'm almost
done, I'm almost done.

1241
01:11:58,909 --> 01:12:00,826
Okay, I think I'm done.

1242
01:12:01,696 --> 01:12:03,534
- Great.
- No, no, wait, wait.

1243
01:12:03,584 --> 01:12:07,528
Oh, wait. (chuckles)
(Jaime sighs)

1244
01:12:07,578 --> 01:12:08,578
"Suck that."

1245
01:12:12,877 --> 01:12:14,051
Okay, I am done.

1246
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:15,147
- Are you sure?

1247
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:16,197
- Yeah.

1248
01:12:22,717 --> 01:12:25,884
Jaime, you are a very talented writer.

1249
01:12:27,397 --> 01:12:29,647
- Scary talented, I'm sure.

1250
01:12:31,719 --> 01:12:34,386
(Alex chuckles)

1251
01:12:37,882 --> 01:12:42,002
- You know what, can
we just take this off?

1252
01:12:42,052 --> 01:12:43,302
- [Jaime] Yeah.

1253
01:12:53,656 --> 01:12:55,502
So, one more?

1254
01:12:55,552 --> 01:12:58,552
- You're finally catching on.
- Yeah.

1255
01:13:07,518 --> 01:13:10,101
(Alex retches)

1256
01:13:17,673 --> 01:13:20,173
(Alex groans)

1257
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:31,281
All of the thin ones were in
the wash, I found this big guy.

1258
01:13:32,447 --> 01:13:35,864
You know, just holler if you get too hot.

1259
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:39,033
Just let me know, all right?
- Thank you, thank you.

1260
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:40,666
- Yeah, no problem.

1261
01:13:43,216 --> 01:13:46,326
Alex.
- Look, I'm fine, I promise.

1262
01:13:46,376 --> 01:13:48,155
- No, I'm gonna go see
if I can't find Barb.

1263
01:13:48,205 --> 01:13:49,724
- No, don't.

1264
01:13:49,774 --> 01:13:50,977
- Look, why not?

1265
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:52,715
- Will you just sit here with me, please?

1266
01:13:52,765 --> 01:13:56,598
- She's probably still here.
- Jaime, sit down.

1267
01:14:02,776 --> 01:14:03,859
Take my hand.

1268
01:14:12,869 --> 01:14:13,952
- Oh, my god.

1269
01:14:17,309 --> 01:14:19,976
(Alex chuckles)

1270
01:14:23,798 --> 01:14:27,548
- I'm fine, nothing's wrong,
I just, if you call her,

1271
01:14:27,598 --> 01:14:29,416
the moment she comes in here,
she'll give me something

1272
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,819
that puts me out and I
don't want that right now.

1273
01:14:31,869 --> 01:14:34,286
I'm having too good of a day.

1274
01:14:35,718 --> 01:14:38,371
- You consider this a good day?

1275
01:14:38,421 --> 01:14:41,601
- Yeah, I haven't laughed
this long in a while.

1276
01:14:41,651 --> 01:14:42,818
I'm exhausted.

1277
01:14:46,981 --> 01:14:50,041
- Why don't you go to sleep?
- Mm, no, not yet.

1278
01:14:50,091 --> 01:14:51,508
I like right now.

1279
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,133
Tell me a story.

1280
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:57,680
- A story?

1281
01:14:59,229 --> 01:15:00,609
You know all my stories.

1282
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:02,969
- It doesn't have to be about you.

1283
01:15:03,019 --> 01:15:04,899
- You know all my stupid stories.

1284
01:15:04,949 --> 01:15:07,979
- Okay, tell me a funny one.

1285
01:15:08,029 --> 01:15:09,361
- A funny one?
- A true one.

1286
01:15:09,411 --> 01:15:11,218
- A true one, a funny true story?

1287
01:15:11,268 --> 01:15:14,807
- Something I've never been told before.

1288
01:15:14,857 --> 01:15:15,857
- All right.

1289
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,567
Okay, hold on.

1290
01:15:22,429 --> 01:15:25,961
In 1989, Mexico City,
(peaceful atmospheric music)

1291
01:15:26,011 --> 01:15:29,990
was dealing with their biggest pollution

1292
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:34,182
and traffic problems
ever, it was unbearable.

1293
01:15:34,232 --> 01:15:36,237
So the government decided they
had to do something about it.

1294
01:15:36,261 --> 01:15:38,051
They had to come up with a solution

1295
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:40,990
to solve this traffic crisis.

1296
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,709
So, they came up with a plan that depended

1297
01:15:44,759 --> 01:15:48,470
on the last digit of
your license plate, okay?

1298
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,448
If it was odd, then you
could drive on these days.

1299
01:15:50,472 --> 01:15:55,472
If it was even, then you can
drive on these days, right?

1300
01:15:55,608 --> 01:15:57,891
They predicated that
this would ease traffic,

1301
01:15:57,941 --> 01:16:00,041
that it would solve
the problem of exhaust,

1302
01:16:00,091 --> 01:16:03,481
that it would cause cars to
be exported out of the city,

1303
01:16:03,531 --> 01:16:05,750
'cause people wouldn't be drivin' as much.

1304
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,189
Seems like a pretty wise plan, doesn't it?

1305
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:09,119
- [Alex] Yeah.

1306
01:16:09,169 --> 01:16:10,067
- So what do you think happened?

1307
01:16:10,117 --> 01:16:11,832
- Did they enforce it?

1308
01:16:11,882 --> 01:16:13,712
- Yeah, they did.

1309
01:16:13,762 --> 01:16:16,372
- Then it worked?
- Nope.

1310
01:16:16,422 --> 01:16:17,272
- Why?

1311
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:21,072
- Because people, they
just bought more cars,

1312
01:16:24,171 --> 01:16:25,760
so that they could drive on the day

1313
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:28,421
that they couldn't drive before.

1314
01:16:28,471 --> 01:16:29,981
Exacerbating the pollution problem,

1315
01:16:30,031 --> 01:16:32,401
because they were just
buying crappy old cars.

1316
01:16:32,451 --> 01:16:35,562
In turn, it made Mexico City
the biggest polluting city

1317
01:16:35,612 --> 01:16:37,029
in North America.

1318
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:40,820
Sorry, that didn't make any sense, did it?

1319
01:16:40,852 --> 01:16:44,002
- No, but it was funny. (chuckles)

1320
01:16:44,052 --> 01:16:46,052
It was funny, thank you.

1321
01:16:48,914 --> 01:16:52,562
- [Jaime] Look, you should
really get some rest, okay?

1322
01:16:52,612 --> 01:16:53,612
- Jaime.

1323
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:58,361
- [Jaime] What's goin' on?

1324
01:17:01,531 --> 01:17:04,744
- I've always been so sure about
every decision I ever made.

1325
01:17:04,794 --> 01:17:08,290
Even if it became a mistake,
I've just been sure.

1326
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:09,507
You know that.

1327
01:17:11,087 --> 01:17:13,087
- I love that about you.

1328
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:18,047
- Choosing you was the most unsure,

1329
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:21,140
scariest moment of my life,

1330
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,850
and I only just now realized why.

1331
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,300
- And why is that?

1332
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:33,053
- It's because it wasn't
my choice to begin with.

1333
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:39,072
It just happened without me
knowing, so it felt different.

1334
01:17:40,828 --> 01:17:43,389
Somewhere along the way,

1335
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:46,810
it could've been when I first met you,

1336
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:48,193
but it happened.

1337
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:54,557
And we laughed and screamed
and we fought to protect it.

1338
01:17:57,439 --> 01:17:59,469
(chuckles)

1339
01:17:59,519 --> 01:18:02,320
The same butterflies I felt
the first time I saw you,

1340
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:03,953
I still have today.

1341
01:18:05,507 --> 01:18:08,544
I don't think we can take
credit for the first ones, but,

1342
01:18:08,594 --> 01:18:13,594
the way I felt when I heard
your footsteps come in the door?

1343
01:18:15,658 --> 01:18:17,426
We earned that.

1344
01:18:17,476 --> 01:18:18,809
That was earned.

1345
01:18:27,287 --> 01:18:28,287
Hey, Jaime.

1346
01:18:31,188 --> 01:18:35,437
Just because I'm gone, doesn't
mean it can't happen again.

1347
01:18:35,487 --> 01:18:36,654
- No, I can't.

1348
01:18:41,154 --> 01:18:42,154
- Hey.

1349
01:18:43,137 --> 01:18:47,387
Life could always be worse.
- Oh, yeah, how is that?

1350
01:18:48,487 --> 01:18:51,654
- Driving in rush hour in Mexico City.

1351
01:18:56,185 --> 01:18:58,602
(Jaime sobs)

1352
01:19:03,835 --> 01:19:04,835
It's okay.

1353
01:19:08,445 --> 01:19:09,445
It's okay.

1354
01:19:15,627 --> 01:19:17,057
(Jaime sobs)

1355
01:19:17,107 --> 01:19:18,190
Come up here.

1356
01:19:20,635 --> 01:19:21,635
Come on.

1357
01:19:33,818 --> 01:19:37,568
(peaceful atmospheric music)

1358
01:22:55,963 --> 01:22:58,546
(food sizzles)

1359
01:23:19,493 --> 01:23:21,521
- Good morning, Jaime.

1360
01:23:21,571 --> 01:23:23,080
(Jaime speaks foreign language)

1361
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:25,513
Good morning, you want the usual, sweetie?

1362
01:23:25,563 --> 01:23:26,646
- Yes.
- Okay.

1363
01:23:31,643 --> 01:23:33,726
- Now, what have we here?

1364
01:23:34,621 --> 01:23:37,121
Three-letter word, a cool can.

1365
01:23:39,752 --> 01:23:40,971
Ice.

1366
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:42,021
Perfect.

1367
01:23:45,272 --> 01:23:48,388
How are you doing?
- Oh, you know, the usual.

1368
01:23:48,438 --> 01:23:49,905
Your bagel should be out in just a second.

1369
01:23:49,929 --> 01:23:51,512
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1370
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:55,490
How's it goin'?
- Good.

1371
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:56,865
- [Waitress] Good, what can I get for ya?

1372
01:23:56,889 --> 01:23:58,763
- I'd like to have a
peppermint herbal tea, please.

1373
01:23:58,787 --> 01:24:01,537
- All right, you got it.
- Thanks.

1374
01:24:03,009 --> 01:24:04,479
- Are you stuck?

1375
01:24:04,529 --> 01:24:05,479
- [Jaime] Yes.

1376
01:24:05,529 --> 01:24:07,130
- Well, maybe I can help.

1377
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:09,229
- Six-letter word.

1378
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:10,279
Solanaceae.

1379
01:24:11,597 --> 01:24:13,909
Fruit from Mexico, good for the heart.

1380
01:24:13,959 --> 01:24:14,959
- Orange?

1381
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:18,592
- Orange I tried, it
contradicts four-down.

1382
01:24:23,169 --> 01:24:25,069
- [Waitress] Oh, I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

1383
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:26,119
- I'm sure.

1384
01:24:29,369 --> 01:24:30,452
- Nightshade.

1385
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:34,719
- Too long.

1386
01:24:35,849 --> 01:24:36,666
- Nope.

1387
01:24:36,716 --> 01:24:40,189
Solanaceae is a nightshade,
it's a plant from Mexico

1388
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:42,319
and it spread through colonization.

1389
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:45,498
Debatably, it's a vegetable too,

1390
01:24:45,548 --> 01:24:49,381
but there are over 10,000
varieties worldwide.

1391
01:24:51,209 --> 01:24:52,697
- Tomato.
- Tomato.

1392
01:24:52,747 --> 01:24:53,747
- Tomato.

1393
01:24:54,609 --> 01:24:57,138
- Tomato is a plant that was originally

1394
01:24:57,188 --> 01:24:58,999
harvested by the Mayans.

1395
01:24:59,049 --> 01:25:03,966
It has a lot of lycopene in it
which is good for the heart.

1396
01:25:24,904 --> 01:25:28,487
(bright atmospheric music)

1397
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:13,783
♪ I know you want it, you got it ♪

1398
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:18,833
