1
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,317
Bombay, 2006

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,447
Jamal Malik is one question away
from winning 20 million rupees.

3
00:01:07,482 --> 00:01:09,119
How did he do it?

4
00:01:09,154 --> 00:01:11,008
A: He cheated

5
00:01:11,043 --> 00:01:12,616
B: He's lucky

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,668
C: He's a genius

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,178
D: It is written

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,965
Good evening! (speaks Hindi)

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,275
Welcome to "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"!

10
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:35,000
Are you ready?

11
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:37,765
Yes.

12
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,000
Please give a big round of applause
to a very first contestant of the night

13
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:47,557
Jamal Malik from our very
own... (speaks Hindi) Mumbay!

14
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:51,213
Hello, let's play.

15
00:02:00,071 --> 00:02:01,730
Smile, you'll be fine.

16
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:05,965
Name.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,388
Motherchud, name!

18
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:13,165
Jamal Malik.

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,393
You have a name. Good. Stop crying.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.

21
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:26,965
So, Jamal...

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,608
tell me something about yourself.

23
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:36,000
I work in a call-center

24
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:38,517
in Juhu. - Good.

25
00:02:38,552 --> 00:02:40,965
A phone basher..

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And what type of call-center should that be?

27
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:45,824
XL5 mobile phones.

28
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:47,732
So you are the one who calls me up

29
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:50,211
every single day of my life
with special offers, huh?

30
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:54,000
No, actually I am an assistant.

31
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:58,965
An assistant phone basher?

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And what does an assistant
phone basher do exactly?

33
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:07,517
I get tea for people and...

34
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:11,276
Chaiwalla. A chaiwalla.

35
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:14,965
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,126
Jamal Malik... (speaks Hindi)
chaiwalla from Mumbay,

37
00:03:18,127 --> 00:03:21,123
let's play "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"!

38
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:32,965
So, has he confessed yet?

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,965
Except his name I could not get
anything of him.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You have been here the whole bloody
night, Srinivas. What have you been doing?

41
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:41,965
He's a tough guy.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
A little electricity will
loosen his tongue, give him.

43
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:46,206
Yes sir.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So, were you wired up?

45
00:03:58,035 --> 00:04:00,965
Mobile phone or a pager?

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Or coughing accomplice in the audience?

47
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:09,274
Or microchip under your skin, huh?

48
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:16,565
The chip is not here.

49
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:19,591
Not here? Ok, leave it.

50
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:23,696
It's hot, and my wife is giving me hell.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,340
I've got a desk full of murderers, rapists,

52
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:32,609
extortionists, bomb bandits, and you.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,628
So why don't you save us both a lot of time

54
00:04:39,777 --> 00:04:43,116
and tell me how you cheated.

55
00:04:58,035 --> 00:05:04,017
I'm done sir.

56
00:05:04,052 --> 00:05:07,217
Now listen.

57
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:11,748
Hello!

58
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:16,048
He's is unconscious,
chutiya. What good is that?

59
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,726
How many times have I told
you, you should once...

60
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,051
I'm sorry sir.

61
00:05:21,052 --> 00:05:21,965
(Speaks Hindi)

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Now we'll have Amnesty International here

63
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:27,000
peeing in their pants about human rights.

64
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:27,965
Sir I was thinking...

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Get him down, tidy him up please.
For God's sake!

66
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:37,965
Sir, what if he did know whe answers?

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Professors, doctors, lawyers,
general knowledge-wallas

68
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:43,000
never get beyond 60000 rupees.

69
00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:44,965
He's on 10 million.

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What can a slumdog possibly know?

71
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:58,035
The answers.

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,500
I knew the answers.

73
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:09,767
Slumdog Millionaire.

74
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:13,451
Jamal, catch it!

75
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,591
Jamal, it's yours!

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,146
How did you manage to drop
a sitter like that, damn it?

77
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:29,757
Private ka-land!

78
00:06:32,035 --> 00:06:33,769
Catch him!

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,527
The dogs are coming! Run!

80
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,559
If the planes won't kill you, we will!

81
00:06:48,035 --> 00:06:50,224
Hey brother!

82
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:21,330
Sorry!

83
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,577
I'm very sorry.

84
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:38,059
Oh shit, it's Mum.

85
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:39,504
You want me to wallop you to death, huh?

86
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:43,948
Brother, leave these two to me.

87
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,488
Come on.

88
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:52,001
Athos.

89
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,236
The Three Musketeers.

90
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:03,040
Repeat it!
"You have sent for me, Sir?" said Athos.

91
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:08,509
Ah, here come our very own musketeers.

92
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,115
Thank you for gracing us all
with your presence.

93
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:14,170
Porthos!

94
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:15,835
Well, open it, Salim.

95
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,331
Stop doing that and open the book, Jamal.

96
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:23,249
Athos?

97
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:45,226
So... Mr. Malik

98
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,548
the man who knows all the answers.

99
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:51,966
Talk.

100
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:55,150
(Speaks Hindi) Talk!

101
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:04,231
So Jamal, are you ready for the
first question, for 1000 rupees?

102
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:06,965
Yes.

103
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Not bad money to sit on a chair

104
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:09,965
and answer a question.

105
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Better than making tea, no?

106
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:14,965
No. Yes. No.

107
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,500
No? Yes? No? Is that your final answer?

108
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:24,000
So remember. You have three lifelines.

109
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:28,000
Ask the audience, fifty-fifty

110
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:29,965
and call a friend.

111
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,859
So the first question, for 1000 rupees,
here we go.

112
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:40,857
Who was the star in the 1973
hit-film "Zanjeer"?

113
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:52,692
I'm in trouble, here...

114
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,999
Here... Money. Take the money...

115
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Get out of there, Jamal.
Prakash wants a big one.

116
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:09,999
Not finished.

117
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,132
Stop your time-pass boys. This is urgent...

118
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:14,326
It's a shy one...

119
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:17,119
and since when there is
a time limit on a crap?

120
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,965
This is borderline kid. Get a move on...

121
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Since there was a customer waiting,
that's when Jamal!

122
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:27,000
Give me the money back!
Give! I'll go elsewhere.

123
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:29,965
Bloody idiot.

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You just lost me a bloody customer.

125
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:36,965
Amitabh's helicopter!

126
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,235
That's Amitabh's helicopter!

127
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,705
Amitabh!

128
00:11:41,922 --> 00:11:44,420
Amitabh Bachchan!

129
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:01,280
Salim, open it!

130
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:44,654
Amitabh Bachchan!

131
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,877
My Amitabh sir!

132
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:05,237
Move, move! Out of the way!

133
00:13:05,272 --> 00:13:07,783
Please wait, I am coming for you!

134
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,846
Amitabh sir, please give me your autograph

135
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,940
You've got it now have you?
Amitabh's autograph?

136
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:19,661
That was my autograph!

137
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:21,710
Amitabh gave it to me!

138
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,519
I'll never get another!

139
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,034
He offered a good price, so I sold it.

140
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:29,330
But it was mine...

141
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:33,965
A, Amitabh Bachchan.

142
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,986
Guess what, you're right.
You just won 1,000 rupees.

143
00:14:41,035 --> 00:14:42,481
You don't have to be a genius.

144
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:45,075
I knew it was Amitabh Bachchan.

145
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,503
Like I said, you do not have to be a genius.

146
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:54,906
He's the most famous man in India.

147
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,067
A picture of three lions, as seen
on the national emblem of India.

148
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,438
What is written underneath?

149
00:15:05,052 --> 00:15:08,043
A: The truth alone triumphs

150
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,262
B: Lies alone triumph

151
00:15:11,552 --> 00:15:14,122
C: Fashion alone triumphs

152
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:18,531
D: Money alone triumphs

153
00:15:23,664 --> 00:15:25,465
What do you think, Jamal?

154
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,910
The most famous phrase of our country.

155
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:32,450
Do you like to call a friend?

156
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:34,965
Ask the audience.

157
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,965
Who'd put him out of his
misery, ladies and gentlemen?

158
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
My five-year old daughter
can answer that question,

159
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:42,387
but you couldn't.

160
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,221
That's strange for a millionaire genius.

161
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:47,486
What happened?

162
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Your accomplice sneaked out for a piss?

163
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:53,965
The inspector is asking something.

164
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,132
How much is panipuri at
Dharisha store on Chowpatty?

165
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,339
What?

166
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:02,830
Panipuri. One plate. How much?

167
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:05,034
- 10 rupees.
- Wrong.

168
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:06,021
15 since Diwali.

169
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,634
Who stole Constable Varmy's bicycle

170
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:13,347
outside Santa Cruz station last Thursday?

171
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:16,406
You know who that was?

172
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Everyone in Juhu knows that.

173
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:21,855
Even five year olds.

174
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,953
Congratulations, Jamal.
You just won 4,000 rupees.

175
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,285
A 16 thousand rupees.

176
00:16:38,552 --> 00:16:41,978
Religion. Interesting.

177
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,716
In depictions of God Rama he is

178
00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:49,369
famously holding what in his right hand?

179
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:38,012
Run!

180
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:44,557
Salim, Jamal! Run!

181
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,086
They're Muslims, get them!

182
00:18:46,284 --> 00:18:48,711
Get a move on! Come with us!

183
00:18:59,215 --> 00:19:00,850
Hey, get lost!

184
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:04,322
Are you deaf? I said piss off!

185
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:10,866
Come with us.

186
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,540
I wake up every morning wishing I did
not know the answer to that question.

187
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:35,000
If it wasn't for Rama and Allah...

188
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:38,524
I would still have a mother.

189
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:49,649
A bow and arrow.

190
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:51,326
Final answer?

191
00:19:53,863 --> 00:19:55,055
Final answer.

192
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,168
Computer, (speaks Hindi) D (speaks Hindi)?

193
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,250
You just won 16000 rupees.

194
00:20:10,138 --> 00:20:12,357
Well done, my friend.

195
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,123
Time for commercial break.
Don't go away now.

196
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:20,965
You got lucky, huh?

197
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,261
If I were you I'd take the money and run.

198
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:26,065
You're not going to the next one.

199
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:01,499
Piss off!

200
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,690
She'll have the security guard on us!

201
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:05,099
Let her in.

202
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,462
She could be the third musketeer.

203
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,891
I'm the elder in this family now,
and I say, she's not coming in, okay?

204
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:16,999
In any case...

205
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,039
We don't even know the name
of the third bloody musketeer.

206
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:42,538
Salim?

207
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:00,707
Come over here.

208
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,911
Where's your mother?

209
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:19,930
Your father?

210
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:25,150
I'm Jamal.

211
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:27,480
This is my brother Salim.

212
00:22:29,035 --> 00:22:30,892
I'm Latika.

213
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,909
You can sleep here if you want.

214
00:22:41,035 --> 00:22:42,987
Thank you Jamal.

215
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,144
Welcome back to "Who
Wants To Be A Milionaire?"

216
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:05,000
Our contestant, Jamal Malik,
call-center assistant from Mumbay,

217
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:06,577
is on 16 thousand rupees,

218
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:10,322
and has already used only one
lifeline, ask the audience.

219
00:23:12,035 --> 00:23:15,638
So my friend, you're into serious money.

220
00:23:17,035 --> 00:23:18,794
Shall we play?

221
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:20,515
Yes.

222
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The song "Darshan Do Ghanshyam" was
written by which famous Indian poet?

223
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,517
A: Surdas

224
00:23:33,552 --> 00:23:35,776
B: Tulsidas

225
00:23:35,811 --> 00:23:37,608

D: Kabir

227
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,948
It's hot, huh?

228
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,252
The way he's taking care of
us, he must be a good man.

229
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:39,999
Must be a bloody saint

230
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,275
We're not allowed to talk to the others.

231
00:25:42,276 --> 00:25:43,999
Why?

232
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,417
If we get seconds, then
he really must be a saint.

233
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:10,902
Very good, Arvind. Very good.

234
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:26,634
Laughing at me. I'll kill you.

235
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:29,051
Hey, get off her.

236
00:26:29,452 --> 00:26:31,460
Don't touch me!

237
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:33,030
You fat bastard!

238
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:36,967
You big tree!

239
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,430
Punnoose, I think you've found your dog.

240
00:26:53,035 --> 00:26:56,556
Okay, time to go. Get to work.

241
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,607
Think you're here for a picnic?

242
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,868
What do you think this is, a holiday?

243
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:15,791
And what are you laughing at?

244
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:21,165
Give me that.

245
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:26,803
Shut up!

246
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:28,263
Brother Salim.

247
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:30,676
What's up little brother, you got a problem?

248
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:32,675
Hey take her. She's yours today.

249
00:27:32,676 --> 00:27:34,063
I don't want her.

250
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:37,207
Take her. It's for your own
good. Babies earn double.

251
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:39,535
She said she doesn't want her.

252
00:27:39,536 --> 00:27:40,512
Shut it Jamal!

253
00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:44,339
Take her now or i'll drop her.

254
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:52,310
Keep her crying, and you'll earn triple.

255
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,638
Come on! Get to work!

256
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:25,783
We'll use the hottest ones.

257
00:29:19,645 --> 00:29:24,657
Chillies on his willy!

258
00:29:30,932 --> 00:29:32,532
I'll get you back!

259
00:29:34,276 --> 00:29:36,150
Go back to sleep all of you!

260
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:04,419
Very good. I am happy.

261
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:08,541
He's ready. - I'm ready as well.

262
00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:25,846
Come on, move the lamp.

263
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,815
Okay.

264
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,714
Bring Jamal over.

265
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,517
Listen, kid. It's decision time.

266
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,193
You want the life of a slumdog
or the life of a man, huh?

267
00:31:45,228 --> 00:31:48,999
A real man. A gunfighter.

268
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,164
Your destiny is in your hands, brother.

269
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:56,939
You can be like me or...

270
00:31:59,035 --> 00:32:00,390
Understand?

271
00:32:04,394 --> 00:32:05,611
I understand.

272
00:32:07,574 --> 00:32:09,934
Go. Get Jamal.

273
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,249
I just need Maman to like my
singing, and we're in the money.

274
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,999
Big money, Latika.

275
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,497
And then what? Can we stop begging?

276
00:32:28,498 --> 00:32:30,913
Begging? Are you kidding?

277
00:32:30,914 --> 00:32:33,337
We'll live in a big house on Harbour Road.

278
00:32:33,338 --> 00:32:36,385
You, me and Salim. The Three Musketeers.

279
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:38,230
Harbour Road. Really?

280
00:32:38,231 --> 00:32:39,524
Yes.

281
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
In the moonlight...

282
00:32:44,035 --> 00:32:44,965
You and me.

283
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,972
You'll dance with me won't you?

284
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,683
I hope you sing better than you dance.

285
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:02,706
It's my turn. - Sing well.

286
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,257
So this is it huh, brother?

287
00:33:14,986 --> 00:33:17,389
The good life here we come.

288
00:33:19,035 --> 00:33:20,943
Athos.

289
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,960
Porthos?

290
00:33:25,872 --> 00:33:27,714
When I say

291
00:33:44,404 --> 00:33:46,000
It's time to get professional.

292
00:33:46,035 --> 00:33:47,965
What? Really?

293
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,860
First, let me hear that song...

294
00:33:52,035 --> 00:33:54,888
Darshan to Ghanshyam.

295
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,323
That's my favourite.

296
00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:05,335
Fifty rupees.

297
00:34:08,753 --> 00:34:10,730
Now I'm a professional, what can I do?

298
00:34:11,322 --> 00:34:12,513
Cheeky little bugger.

299
00:34:15,164 --> 00:34:16,974
Here you go.

300
00:34:37,861 --> 00:34:40,559
Jamal, go. Run!

301
00:34:40,594 --> 00:34:42,689
Hold on! Catch them!

302
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,833
Get the torches! Get them!

303
00:35:13,035 --> 00:35:15,071
Latika, run!

304
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,811
Come on, Latika! Grab his hand!

305
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:09,314
What happened, what happened?

306
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:11,829
She let go!

307
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,034
We've got to go back,
brother. We've got to go.

308
00:36:22,035 --> 00:36:24,034
Go back and we're dead.

309
00:36:24,035 --> 00:36:25,999
Have you gone mad?

310
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,789
He was going to take your eyes out!

311
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,571
With a spoon.

312
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,384
Don't worry about her. She'll be fine.

313
00:36:45,035 --> 00:36:48,861
She always is.

314
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:07,583
Surdas.

315
00:37:13,776 --> 00:37:16,426
Surdas?

316
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,915
Surdas (speaks Hindi) final answer?

317
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:26,189
Yes.

318
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,277
Guess what, you're right!

319
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,240
Blind singers earn double you know that?

320
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,356
What happened to a girl?
They blinded her too?

321
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:54,812
They had other plans.

322
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,345
Well it took me a long time to find out.

323
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:20,965
Got to let it go.

324
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:25,035
Come on.

325
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,894
Where? - I'm starving.

326
00:39:45,535 --> 00:39:47,035
Get up!

327
00:39:48,535 --> 00:39:51,535
So is it your Dad's train then?

328
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:16,768
Is this heaven?

329
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,255
You are not dead, Jamal.

330
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:25,051
What is it?

331
00:41:25,052 --> 00:41:27,236
Some hotel huh?

332
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,938
The Taj Mahal is considered the
finest example of modern architecture.

333
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:42,734
...was completed around 1648 using
the labour force of 20'000 workers.

334
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:48,644
In 1980 it became a UNESCO
World Heritage Site and was cited...

335
00:42:00,035 --> 00:42:03,070
Official tour guide.

336
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:05,272
Please take off your shoes

337
00:42:23,035 --> 00:42:25,775
Please, please.

338
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,299
What time is the next tour?

339
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,825
We are on tight schedule.

340
00:42:29,826 --> 00:42:31,437
We have to see the Red
Fort this afternoon.

341
00:42:31,438 --> 00:42:32,999
VISITORS ARE REQUESTED TO COLLECT RECEIPT

342
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,899
No, I... - Please, would it be possibló
to show us up round now?

343
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:42,882
Obviously we understand that it
costs more for just the two of us.

344
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:45,459
But of course madam!

345
00:42:46,089 --> 00:42:47,473
Please follow me.

346
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,965
The Taj Mahal was built by Emperor Khurrama

347
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,500
for his wife Mumtaz, who was the
maximum beautiful woman in the world.

348
00:42:57,535 --> 00:43:03,000
Then when she died, the emperor
decided to build this five-star hotel,

349
00:43:03,035 --> 00:43:05,965
for everyone who would
like to visit her tomb.

350
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
But he died in 1587 before any of the
rooms were built, or any of the lifts.

351
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
But this swimming pool as you can see was
completed on schedule in top class fashion.

352
00:43:20,035 --> 00:43:22,965
Is says nothing of this in the guide book.

353
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,000
The guide book was written by a bunch
of lazy good-for-nothing Indian beggars.

354
00:43:31,035 --> 00:43:36,000
And this lady and gentlemen
is the burial place of Mumtaz.

355
00:43:36,035 --> 00:43:38,965
How did she die?

356
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,500
A road traffic accident. - Really?

357
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,965
Maximum pile-up.

358
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,965
I thought she died in childbirth.

359
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Exactly sir. She was on the way
to hospital when it happened.

360
00:43:59,035 --> 00:44:01,847
Ready?

361
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:04,343
Smile.

362
00:44:11,477 --> 00:44:14,568
Shoes! American brands!

363
00:44:36,035 --> 00:44:39,593
Smile.

364
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
This, Mr David, is the biggest
Dhobi Ghat in the whole of India.

365
00:44:57,035 --> 00:44:58,965
That's amazing.

366
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Come on, take a real good look at this.

367
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:04,965
They say that every man in Uttar Pradesh

368
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
is wearing a kurta that has been
at least washed once out here.

369
00:45:17,371 --> 00:45:22,242
Move it around! Pit-stop's god
speed! Schumacher got style!

370
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,508
There are the cows or are those
buffalos... What are those over there?

371
00:45:36,035 --> 00:45:37,965
Oh, shit.

372
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,965
What the hell happened here?

373
00:45:48,035 --> 00:45:49,965
Ok. Hold it!

374
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You've got the insurance don't you?

375
00:45:52,395 --> 00:45:53,155
Are you ok?

376
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:56,196
You wanted to see a bit
of real India? Here it is!

377
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,975
Well, here is a bit of
the real America, son.

378
00:46:01,548 --> 00:46:03,000
("Money")

379
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:04,635
Oh, yes, yes! Jesus...

380
00:46:08,011 --> 00:46:08,932
Here.

381
00:47:52,848 --> 00:47:56,000
On an american 100 dollar bill

382
00:47:56,001 --> 00:48:00,125
there's a portrait of
which american statesman?

383
00:48:01,035 --> 00:48:04,051
A: George Washington

384
00:48:04,052 --> 00:48:07,560
B: Franklin Roosevelt

385
00:48:07,561 --> 00:48:11,083
C: Benjamin Franklin

386
00:48:11,084 --> 00:48:14,480
D: Abraham Lincoln

387
00:48:17,942 --> 00:48:22,465
Pay or play, Jamal?

388
00:48:23,035 --> 00:48:25,835
You decide.

389
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Oh god he's looking at the
camera. He hasn't got a clue.

390
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:33,017
This is gonna be a walk away. Stand by.

391
00:48:33,052 --> 00:48:36,000
No, he's gonna play with him first.

392
00:48:36,035 --> 00:48:37,965
Jamal?

393
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,150
Get a lot of 100 dollar bills
in your in your line of work?

394
00:48:43,185 --> 00:48:46,965
A minimum tip for my services.

395
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Oh, now I know why my
cellphone bills are so high.

396
00:48:50,035 --> 00:48:54,000
They tip the chaiwalla
with 100 dollar bills.

397
00:48:54,035 --> 00:48:56,517
It's C. Benjamin Franklin.

398
00:48:56,552 --> 00:48:58,965
You're gonna play, huh?

399
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I think I've just had, hadn't I?

400
00:49:01,035 --> 00:49:03,017
So you exactly have C, right?

401
00:49:03,052 --> 00:49:05,000
Who's on 1,000 rupee note?

402
00:49:05,035 --> 00:49:07,495
I don't know.

403
00:49:08,052 --> 00:49:09,604
You don't know?

404
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:12,725
Ghandi is he.

405
00:49:13,692 --> 00:49:15,821
Oh, I have heard of him.

406
00:49:19,035 --> 00:49:19,965
Don't get clever

407
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
or I'll get the electricity out again.

408
00:49:23,035 --> 00:49:24,965
Look.

409
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
They didn't ask me that
question. I don't know why.

410
00:49:29,035 --> 00:49:30,965
Ask them.

411
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It's funny, you don't seem
like you're interested in money.

412
00:49:37,035 --> 00:49:40,107
By the fact you have...

413
00:49:40,337 --> 00:49:44,518
one million rupees!

414
00:49:47,947 --> 00:49:51,203
Explain the 100 dollar bill.

415
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,346
Bombay had turned name to Mumbay.

416
00:49:59,035 --> 00:50:00,854
Why don't you understand?

417
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,965
A girl lived here. As tall as me perhaps.

418
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,019
Her name was Latika.
Don't know anyone of that name.

419
00:51:08,464 --> 00:51:12,590
Two chicken burgers, two
fries, one diet cola, one coke!

420
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:14,351
One mineral water!

421
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:18,978
Shimla.

422
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,500
I'm going to Chowpatty, ok? Wanna come?

423
00:51:24,535 --> 00:51:29,000
For god's sake, you've got some disease?

424
00:51:29,035 --> 00:51:31,517
You're forcing back to this shithole.

425
00:51:31,552 --> 00:51:34,000
We leave our friends, a good life,

426
00:51:34,035 --> 00:51:36,017
lots of money. For this?!

427
00:51:36,052 --> 00:51:37,965
We came back to find her.

428
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,500
You did. I don't give a shit about her.

429
00:51:41,535 --> 00:51:45,000
Plenty of pussy in Bombay for Salim.

430
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:45,965
Oh yes!

431
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
You should come back to
the Cages on Saturday night,

432
00:51:49,035 --> 00:51:53,000
instead of ghost searching
for your lost love.

433
00:51:53,035 --> 00:51:55,517
I'm going to Chowpatty.

434
00:51:55,552 --> 00:51:57,965
I'm going to Chowpatty!

435
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
There are 19 million
people in this city, Jamal.

436
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:05,000
Forget about her.

437
00:52:05,035 --> 00:52:08,489
She's a "stree"(? = young
indian female dancer).

438
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:29,040
Greetings, Sir.

439
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:32,988
Blessings be unto those
who do good for others.

440
00:52:42,035 --> 00:52:44,517
Dollars. How much?

441
00:52:44,518 --> 00:52:47,534
100. - So you take me for a fool.

442
00:52:47,535 --> 00:52:50,940
Honestly. I swear on my mothers soul.

443
00:52:50,941 --> 00:52:57,440
What's on this note? Whose picture is it?

444
00:52:57,441 --> 00:52:59,965
There's an old man...

445
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
He's bald on top with long
hair on the sides, like a girl.

446
00:53:04,035 --> 00:53:06,229
Benjamin Franklin.

447
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,034
So you're a big guy now, Jamal.

448
00:53:16,035 --> 00:53:18,517
I'm happy for you.

449
00:53:18,552 --> 00:53:20,965
I'm sorry...

450
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
You got saved my friend. I wasn't so lucky.

451
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:26,517
That's the only difference.

452
00:53:26,552 --> 00:53:28,776
Arvind, I'm trying to find...

453
00:53:28,811 --> 00:53:31,000
You owe Maman. Stay away.

454
00:53:31,035 --> 00:53:33,460
He never forgets.

455
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:35,983
I owe Latika.

456
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,965
She's alive isn't she?

457
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,809
More than alive. She's on Pila
street. They call her Cherry.

458
00:53:47,035 --> 00:53:48,880
Thanks.

459
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,198
I'll be singing at your funeral.

460
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,786
So, is it her or not?
