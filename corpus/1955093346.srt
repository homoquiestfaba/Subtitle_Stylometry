about legendary
Texas football players,

7
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,642
and you're a legend yourself.

8
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,563
Was I a player?

9
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,690
Why,yes.

10
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,358
You were a great
football player

in the late 1940s.

But you coached UT

15
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,705
and won three
national championships.

16
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:03,832
Yes.

17
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,710
Texas had 30
All-American players

18
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,545
while you were coaching.

19
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,007
Which one had the
greatest impact on you

20
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,425

I'm sorry, Coach,

24
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:28,732

wasn't an All-American.

played here over the years.

I'd see this place.

to do with it,

367
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,897
you'll be playing here.

368
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:59,485

You ready to go meet him?

369

again this morning.

You run like you got a school
of minnows in your pants.

you attack.

378
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,166
to drive through
the ball carrier.

379
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,585
Notjust lay him
on the ground.

380
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,378
Looks like that just
comes natural to you.

381
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,553
I'm thinking about you
playing some safety

382
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,347
and maybe returning punts.

383
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,183
How's that sound to you?

384
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,900
Maybe you need
some time to decide.

388
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:31,911
Well, every other
coach just thought

389
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,996
I was too small to play.

390
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,122

391
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,251
Well, I'm 5'10".

392
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,545

giving me the chance, sir.

for Texas football.

to be a little different.

No, a lot different than anything
we've ever done here before.

<i>He's at the 30, the 20, 10.</i>

1233
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:12,607
<i>Touchdown, James Street.
What a run!</i>

1234
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:15,443
<i>PHIL: You can't hold
a <i>good man down, Joe.</i>

1235
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:17,445
<i>We've been seeing
that scrambling artistry</i>

1236
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,781
<i>from James Street
for the last two years.</i>

1237
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:22,033
<i>And now we can pull
within seven.</i>

1238
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,243
<i>JOE: Wait a minute, Phil.</i>

1239
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,246
<i>Look there. Texas is going
for the two-point conversion.</i>

1240
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,331
PHIL: <i>That's</i> a <i>big risk.</i>

1241
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:29,457
<i>If they fail, that makes it</i>

1242
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,334
a <i>two-possession game
instead of one.</i>

1243
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,128
<i>JOE: Coach Royal rolling
the dice on this one.</i>

1244
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:36,381
<i>It's Street, he fakes left.</i>

1245
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,675
<i>Spins, goes right.
And he's in there!</i>

1246
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:40,301
<i>Two points, Texas.</i>

1247
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:42,845
<i>Arkansas 14, Texas 8.</i>

1248
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:45,556
<i>PHIL: Darrell Royal,
the riverboat gambler,</i>

1249
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,808
<i>wins that bet.</i>

1250
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,851
<i>The number one team in
the land is back in the game.</i>

1251
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:50,603
Let's go, come on.

1252
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:53,523
<i>JOE: Montgomery goes back
and hits Dicus again!</i>

1253
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,650
<i>A 21-yard gain.</i>

1254
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,237
(GROANING SOFTLY)

1255
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:13,334
Down.

1256
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:18,047
Set! Hut!

1257
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,890
<i>JOE: There's the throw.
And it's too long.</i>

1258
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,600
<i>But we have a flag.</i>

1259
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:30,935
PHIL: <i>There was</i> a <i>hold.</i>

1260
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:32,270
<i>Steinmark was
going to get beat,</i>

1261
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,480
<i>and he grabbed his jersey
to save a touchdown.</i>

1262
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,232
I've got holding, number 28.

1263
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:37,525
<i>PHIL: So, with that penalty,</i>

1264
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:38,901
<i>that's going to
be a 15-yarder.</i>

1265
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:41,195
<i>That's going to move it
all the way from the 24</i>

1266
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:43,865
<i>down inside the 10-yard
line to the 9, Joe.</i>

1267
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:46,075
<i>JOE: I've never seen
him do that before.</i>

1268
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,620
He's finished.
Take him out.

1269
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:51,706
Get in there.

1270
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,254
Freddie!

1271
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,383
FREDDIE: You can do it, Rick.

1272
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:04,886
<i>JOE: Rick Nabors,
the backup safety is in.</i>

1273
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:07,054
PHIL: <i>Joe, I believe that's
the first time I can remember</i>

1274
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:09,515
<i>he's being pulled from the
game for not doing his job.</i>

1275
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:12,143
At least he
saved a touchdown.

1276
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,731
I'm sorry, son.
I hated to do it.

1277
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:19,567
The right call.

1278
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:28,576
Bring your kinnies!

1279
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:30,369
Come on, now.
Stiff it up!

1280
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:32,121
JAMES: Set! Hut!

1281
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:35,750
<i>JOE: Montgomery, looking
for Dicus. He throws it.</i>

1282
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:36,834
<i>Interception!</i>

1283
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,544
<i>Danny Lester.</i>

1284
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:41,047
<i>He breaks the tackle
and returns it back</i>

1285
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,882
<i>all the way to the 25.</i>

1286
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,383
<i>PHIL: That's a <i>big break
for the Longhorns.</i>

1287
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:45,510
<i>They dodged a bullet.</i>

1288
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,178
<i>Montgomery and Dicus
were on a roll.</i>

1289
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,596
Offense, on the field.

1290
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:50,014
<i>JOE: And here we go.
With six minutes to go,</i>

1291
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:51,933
<i>Texas needs to make
something happen.</i>

1292
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:53,601
<i>Time's running out.</i>

1293
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,522
<i>And it's Street to Speyrer
on the end-around.</i>

1294
01:11:57,605 --> 01:12:00,149
<i>He breaks it up field
to the 40, 45,</i>

1295
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,193
<i>into Arkansas territory.</i>

1296
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:06,405
Set! Hut!

1297
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,992
<i>JOE: Koy, with a quick
hit to the inside.</i>

1298
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:11,577
<i>A gain of a couple.</i>

1299
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:14,997
<i>Worster again, off tackle.
Maybe three yards at the most.</i>

1300
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:18,417
<i>Third and five. Worster again.
They didn't make it.</i>

1301
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,585
<i>PHIL: Now it's fourth down</i>

1302
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:20,670
<i>and the clock is
still running, Joe.</i>

1303
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,004
Damn it.

1304
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,256
Ref!

1305
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,509
<i>JOE: Time out, Texas. Fourth
at about two and a half.</i>

1306
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:29,011
<i>PHIL: Oh, this is going
to be Coach Royal's</i>

1307
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:31,138
<i>biggest call of the game,
if not the season.</i>

1308
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:32,473
<i>JOE: No doubt.</i>

1309
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,183
That veer should be there.

1310
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:35,351
Fourth and two and a half.

1311
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:36,435
Fourth and two and a half.

1312
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:38,104
But with this field
position, if we go for this

1313
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,522
and don't make it,
and give it back to them,

1314
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:40,773
that's it, game's over.

1315
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,650
We got four
minutes left.

1316
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,576
Right 53 veer pass.

1317
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:57,373
Hey, Coach! Right 53
veer pass. You sure?

1318
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:59,625
Hell yes, I'm sure.
Run the play.

1319
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:01,878
Yes, sir.

1320
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:08,843
Yeah, I might be wrong,
but I'm not confused.

1321
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:12,889
Defense, get ready.

1322
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,933
All right. Get in tight.

1323
01:13:16,017 --> 01:13:17,685
Randy, this one's
coming to you.

1324
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:20,855
Right 53 veer pass. On one.

1325
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,273
You better be open.

1326
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:23,608
I'm always open.

1327
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:24,942
All right.

1328
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:26,777
On one, on one! Ready?
PLAYERS: Break!

1329
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:28,613
Carry out your fate!

1330
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:32,408
JOE: Here we go. James
Street, over center.

1331

<i>Everybody on their feet here

up with the ball.</i>

Yeah, baby! (LAUGHS)

1337
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:15,201

<i>JOE: James Street and Randy
Peschel coming through.</i>

JAMES: Huddle up! Huddle up!

1346
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:36,138
All right, Darrell,
you're a genius.

1347
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,848
JAMES: Set! Hut!

<i>JOE: Hand off to Ted Koy,</i>

1349

<i>and he pounds his way
to the two-yard line.</i>

1350
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,314
<i>An 11-yard gain.</i>

<i>Touchdown, Texas!</i>

1354
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:54,782
<i>A 14-14 tie!</i>

1355
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:57,451
<i>PHIL: And that's why
Coach Royal went for two.</i>

1356
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:58,953
<i>To set up kick and a simple</i>

1357
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:00,788
<i>extra point
in taking the lead.</i>

1358

Keep Dicus on the inside.

1367
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:18,055
Don't bite on
his post move.

1368
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:19,140
Got you.

1369
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:21,434
You're doing great.
One more stop.

All right.

We got three minutes

Saddle up!

I love you.

1573
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:39,045
How are you, Linda?

1574
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:44,217
Coach.

1575
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:45,635
I thought you were
in New York.

1576
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:48,221
Ah, hell, I never liked
those big cities.

1577
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:51,516
If Coach is here,
it must be serious.

1578
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:54,770
DR. MARTIN: Well, Freddie, I'm
going to lay it out to you,

1579
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:56,480
as simple as possible.

1580
01:27:56,813 --> 01:27:59,149
We're going to
biopsy your tumor.

1581
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:02,152
Best scenario is that it's
benign, we can drain it,

1582
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:04,321
and you'll be out
of here in no time.

1583
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:06,239
But the chance
of that happening,

1584
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:09,493
based on my reading of the
X-ray, is quite small.

1585
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:14,790
It's most likely an
osteogenic sarcoma.

1586
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:17,334
Bone cancer.

1587
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:22,881
If that's the case,

1588
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:26,384
I'm going to have to
amputate your leg.

1589
01:28:28,595 --> 01:28:30,555
We have no other choice.

1590
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:34,184
Okay.

and we've come back.
We've never given up.

You can't give up now.

I want you all to
know the outcome

before you heard it
from somewhere else.

1626
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,667
They found a cancerous tumor,

1627
01:31:05,085 --> 01:31:07,504
the size of a baseball,
on his femur.

1628
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:10,882
Doctors told me
they didn't know

1629
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:12,467
how he could
walk on that leg,

1630

much less play football.

1631
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:17,389
Of course, I'm sure

1632
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:19,599
that wouldn't surprise
anybody here.

1633
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:26,064
They amputated his leg...

Men, your teammate is in
the fight of his life.

01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:46,167
or have ever known,
who's up to it,

1638
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:49,629
it's Freddie Joe Steinmark.

1639
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:53,717
That boy has never backed down
against nothing or nobody,

1640
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,010

Are they gonna let him
out of the hospital

know where I stand.

1758

on how bone cancer

I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

1769

to tell me the truth.
