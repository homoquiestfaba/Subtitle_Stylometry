- An unidentified female
Caucasian has been found

15
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,491
dead on a beach in Micronesia.

16
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,535
Experts are puzzled
by the bite imprint,

17
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,995
which appears to be from
a great white shark,

18
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,664
previously never known to swim

19
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,251
within 1,000 miles
of these islands.

20
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,109
Your call has been forwarded

21
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,987
to an automatic

22
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,324
At the tone, please
record your message.

23
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,576
- Hi, Mom.

24
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,829
Can you call me, please?

25
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,915
I just had really bad dream.

26
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,168
I love you.

27
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,737
- A government bill to-
- Babies.

28
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,363
- Crack
down on laboratory
experiments on animals

29
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,449
is expected to become law today.

30
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,784
Animal activists have
been pushing for the bill

31
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,621
for nine years and have taken
part in mass demonstrations

32
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,122
throughout the nation.

33
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,333
It's expected the bill will
outline just what animals

34
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,460
will be allowed to
be used in the labs,

35
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,588
along with penalties
for the offenders.

36
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,299
36 hours of steady rainfall
have left many homes

37
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,218
in the Metro area

38
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,801
knee deep in flood waters.

39
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,303
Power was over three
hours in eastern metro-

40
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,555
- Mom?
- Because of downed hydro-

41
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,015
- Hi, Guru.
- Police report at least

42
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,310
200 accidents were reported.
- No, I can't reach her.

43
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,229
Is she okay?
- Clean up is expected

44
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,812
to take at least two days.

45
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,397
Damage to homes and property

46
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,900
is pegged at $3 million.
- Okay.

47
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,818
I will be on the
first flight tonight.

48
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,111
Fighting broke out overnight-
- Bye.

49
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,446
Between rival factions along

50
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,448
the Israeli-Syrian border.

51
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,659
Initial reports claim
there's been jet fighters

52
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,119
bombing for days now.

53
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,125
- Auntie Lucy will take care
of you for a while, okay?

54
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,126
Okay?

55
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,764
Attention passengers who are

56
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,686
connecting through flight
697 going to Chicago,

57
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,772
please proceed to gate 51.

58
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,192
This flight has been delayed.

59
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,280
- Hey, Guru.

60
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,531
Please tell me you
heard from her.

61
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,366
- Hey.
- Hey, hi.

62
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,201
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

63
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,494
- You remember to
remove the battery

64
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,745
out of your phone
during the flight?

65
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,206
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, let's go.

66
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,418
Your mother was
been acting strange.

67
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,670
Past tense, why?

68
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,714
- I have not seen
her in three days,

69
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,508
making it present tense.

70
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:06,806
- My mother is a dreamer and
most dreamers are strange.

71
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,934
- Where would the world
be without dreamers?

72
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,437
Stone Age.

73
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,355
- Probably, but your
mother was acting

74
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,566
really strange for herself.

75
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,818
- Guru, when you say
someone is acting strange,

76
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,739
they're either normal or
they grew a third eye.

77
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,700
- I mean a third
eye kind of strange.

78
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,453
- Meaning?
- Hm.

79
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,289
Your mom hooked up
with this scientist guy

80
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,624
and he's also missing.

81
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,917
- Define hooked up.

82
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,878
- He thought they
had a thing going on.

83
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,879
- A thing?

84
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,882
- The day your mom vanished,

85
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,968
she came to me and told
me she had a breakthrough,

86
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,929
but she was afraid
of the repercussions.

87
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,890
- Could you be more confusion?

88
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,310
- All right, the last
time anyone saw your mom,

89
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,188
she went to go visit
this scientist guy.

90
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,607
He wasn't really her type,

91
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,818
but I don't think
he got that message.

92
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,947
- Okay, this doctor, does
he have a name, address?

93
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,116
- Yes and no.

94
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,704
His name's Dr.
Mitchell Linenrose.

95
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,457
He has no address.

96
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,042
Your mom didn't
want people to know

97
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,753
where she was when
she wasn't with us.

98
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,799
Your mother had a secret lab
that wasn't really a secret

99
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,803
because she made a video in
front of the lab she dreamed of,

100
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,306
but she had a real one
in a secret location.

101
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:35,310
I think the team's
gonna be a little better

102
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,354
at answers than I am.

103
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,983
- Wow, a random word
generator would be better.

104
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,363
- Hello, everyone.

105
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,656
This is Pom here.

106
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:51,159
We are finally here at
this beautiful island.

107
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,661
Look behind me.

108
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,037
Amazing.

109
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,375
But take a look at the trash.

110
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,753
Make sure that you are sharing
the knowledge with everybody.

111
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,839
We do not want this
world to be polluted.

112
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,881
We love the dolphins.

113
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,216
We love the ocean.

114
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,509
Yes!

115
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,969
We are here with my
lovely friend, Dean.

116
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,681
Dean, tell us, what is the
biggest issue with pollution?

117
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,475
- Plastic is found
everywhere, the world over.

118
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,019
It's found in food packaging,
it's found in household goods,

119
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,105
it's found in electronics.

120
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,441
A piece of plastic like
this can break down

121
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,110
and kill over 1,000 fish.

122
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,028
We have to fix this.

123
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,072
It's not just about
reducing the use of plastic,

124
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,741
it's about coming up with
something to replace plastic,

125
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,410
and that's where
science comes in.

126
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,995
And that's where we need you.

127
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,122
We need young minds to
help work on the problem,

128
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,707
to come up with something
that's gonna work

129
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,834
for the future and
solve this issue.

130
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,253
And you can be a hero, join us.

131
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,629
And instead of just
waiting for you,

132
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,840
I'm gonna get started now.

133
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,175
It starts with me.

134
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,386

136
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,099
Let's encourage the world

137
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,853
to save the planet one
trash pickup at a time.

138
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,229
Please share and
subscribe for me.

139
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,230
Thank you.

140
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,157
- What up, Sheils?
- Hey, Luca.

141
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,745
- Smile!
- Okay.

142
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,622
- Okay, second
pose, second pose.

143
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,623
Okay.

144
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,001
And another one just in case.

145
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,087
Same Pom, same Pom.

146
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,758
- Hey, Sheila.
- Hey.

147
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,762
- I'm sure your mom's fine.

148
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,305
She's just working on something

149
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,933
keeping her busy for a few days.

150
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,143
I'm glad you found an excuse
to come and see us though.

151
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,686
- Yeah.

152
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,647
- Hey, Dean, why don't you
help Sheila with her bags?

153
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,982
Let's get on the ferry.

154
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,901
- Ready?

155
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,035
All is good.

156
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,480
- She's just worried
about her mom.

157
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,816
- Aren't we all?

158
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,985
- Completely.

159
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,530
She's like a mom to all of us,
but she's Sheila's real mom.

160
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,531
- Duh.

161
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,870
- One more duh out of you and
your phone is going swimming.

162
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,455
- You monster.

163
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,834
You touch this phone,
I'm throwing you over.

164
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,005
- Would you like a coconut?

165
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,217
- I could really
use some coffee.

166
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,763
- There's no Starbucks
where we're going.

167
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,475
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
about my mind and my mouth.

168
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,353
Somethings they're
not always in sync.

169
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,979
- Okay.

170
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,524
Are you as sure as Dean
is that my mother is okay?

171
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,403
- I'm not really sure.

172
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:59,075
I kinda have this sixth
sense, uh, I don't know.

173
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,827
- Has anyone
notified the police?

174
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,373
- You know I only trust
you and your mother.

175
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,336
- Oh, Guru, seriously, we
need all help we can get.

176
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,712
- I know, I know.

177
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,132
I just, I just
don't trust anybody.

178
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,593
I've been hurt too many times.

179
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:23,223
- Yes, but maybe they know
Linenrose or can locate him.

180
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,432
- If that's even his name.

181
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,018
It sounds like fake
alias, some crazy name.

182
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,019
I don't know.

183
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,199
- Okay?

184
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,807
Welcome.

185
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,602
I think you're gonna find
this room very comfortable.

186
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,188
This is where your mother stays.

187
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,691
You can stay here
until she shows up.

188
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,825
I looked around for some clues.

189
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,368
I couldn't really find anything.

190
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,788
Maybe you'll find something.

191
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,505
Your mother found
inspiration in that.

192
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,465
She believed the oceans
held many secrets

193
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,717
for us to discover.

194
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,262
- The secrets beneath.

195
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,933
That's my mom.

196
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,644
A stubborn dreamer.
- Indeed.

197
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,896
And so was Gandhi
and everybody else

198
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,732
who made this world
a better place.

199
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,485
Unpack your things.

200
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,030
We're gonna meet out here at
the beach side bar for drinks.

201
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,366
See you in a few minutes.

202
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:59,421
- Mom, where are you?

203
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,969
- There you are, bud.
- Cheers, mate, next one.

204
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,679
- So, what are you
doing in town anyway?

205
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,138
- Just a little snorkeling.

206
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,431
- Snorkeling?
- Mm hm.

207
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,641
- Did you hear about
the lady got taken

208
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,310
by a great white
shark yesterday?

209
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,522
- Yesterday?
- Yeah.

210
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,523
- Cheers.

211
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,279
Guys, guys, come over.

212
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,740
So...

213
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,581
So, the barman just told
me there's been a body

214
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,625
of an unidentified woman
found not far from here.

215
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,877
- What?

216
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,129
- Said it was a great
white shark attack.

217
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,964
- Great whites don't
come near this region.

218
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:43,965
- It's been confirmed.

219
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,550
It's a great white.

220
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,302
- What does it say, Pom?

221
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,971
- White woman, 40s.

222
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,514
- Oh, my God.

223
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,724
- It's gotta be a tourist.

224
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,393
- Let's not jump
to any conclusions.

225
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,312
- Yeah, let's just into the car.

226
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,813
Let's go to police station.

227
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,231
- The polices are
on the mainland.

228
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,734
We have to wait for the
ferry in the morning.

229
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,028
- Then I'm going at daybreak.

230
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,323
- The body hasn't been
retrieved or confirmed.

231
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,866
- Can you send them a message

232
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,868
or call them to see
where the body is?

233
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,869
- Of course.

234
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,580
- We can go with you.

235
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,331
- No, no, you stay here.

236
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,498
Hopefully it's not her

237
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,251
and we will just
keep looking for her.

238
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,628
Guru will take me.

239
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,004
Right, Guru?

240
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,506
- I'm always with you, Sheila.

241
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,156
Hi.
- May I help you?

242
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,991
- Yeah, the police
sent us to look at

243
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,160
the shark attack victim.

244
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,913
It might be this girl's
mother and unfortunately

245
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,540
I kinda have a bad
feeling about this.

246
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,292
- The police just called.

247
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,961
We can show you.

248
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,128
May I see your passport please?

249
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,129
- Yeah, of course.

250
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,637
- Thank you.

251
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,560
Okay.

252
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,854
We've had the body moved
to a private room for you.

253
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:22,855
- Why?

254
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,234
- Our cadaver storage has
several other shark victims

255
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,737
that you'd rather not
have in your mind's eye.

256
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,574
- Do you know where these
shark attacks are happening?

257
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,576
- We only know where the
bodies have been found.

258
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,828
The tides and currents can move

259
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,664
a body many miles
along the coast.

260
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,500
Please, this way.
- Okay, yeah.

261
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,593
- The news said it's
a great white shark?

262
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,054
- The bite pattern
and the size match.

263
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,347
We've also recovered a tooth

264
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,766
that's indisputably
a great white.

265
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,310
- Water temperatures screwing
with the migration pattern

266
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,772
of fish, polluted waters.

267
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,942
This world is just going crazy.

268
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
- Here we are.

269
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,956
Are you sure you wanna see this?

270
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,233
- It's the plastic people.

271
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,652
- I don't understand.

272
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,904
- Nothing.

273
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,492
- I'm sorry, I need
official identification

274
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,577
from a family member.

275
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,872
- It is my mother,
Amanda Williams.

276
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,841
Her wish is to be
cremated and for her ashes

277
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,012
to be spread in the
sea at the sunset.

278
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,015
- I'll have that
arranged immediately.

279
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,018
Let's complete the paperwork.

280
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,105
- Can I just have
a moment with her?

281
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,752
- Yes, of course, of course.
- Please.

282
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,756
I don't understand
what is going on.

283
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,050
I don't know what you were up to

284
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,888
or where this lab of
yours is, but.

285
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,893
You know I'm stubborn.

286
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,108
I got it from you.

287
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,493
I will, I will find
out what is going on.

288
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,916
I'll just, I'll hunt
that shark down.

289
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,424
And get justice for you.

290
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:42,264
I love you.

291
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,498
Mom, I love you.

292
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:59,257
I'm releasing your
earthly remains

293
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,676
into the sea as you wished.

294
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,597
May you find
happiness in eternity.

295
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:11,227
Where one day it will be...

296
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,439
One day it will be you
and me again, together.

297
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,219
- Yeah, she always
knew what to say.

298
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,514
No matter what the
situation was, she was just,

299
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:52,310
she had wisdom beyond her years.

300
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,646
But your mother had a way
of just comforting me.

301
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,149
And again, she was like a
sister and she just knew

302
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,276
how to say the
right things to me.

303
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,945
And that's I think where your
mother and I became really,

304
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,906
really close and became
really, really good friends.

305
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,074
'Cause we knew each other then,

306
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,410
but we didn't know
each other that great.

307
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,788
But she just kinda
held me and just said

308
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,749
all the right things, you know?

309
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,916
And it was a beautiful moment.

310
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:19,462
And we spent a lotta
time that night

311
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,756
walking around the
woods just her and I.

312
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,257
And some of the
friends had thought

313
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,968
we had gotten together or
something, which we didn't.

314
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:26,928
We were just friends.

315
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,095
We just became very close.

316
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,764
And so, I always
was very comfortable

317
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,932
with your mother, as you know.

318
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,728
But yeah, we had some really
good times when we were younger

319
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,023
and I just, she always
knew what to say.

320
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,650
- Do you know how
I met your mom?

321
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,487
No, she never told me.

322
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:48,617
- Christmas Eve, years
ago, I was at a bar.

323
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,914
Oh, I was an idiot,
such an idiot back then.

324
00:22:55,123 --> 00:23:00,128
And I was with some
so-called friends.

325
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,880
Didn't know your mom then.

326
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:07,886
And there, the so-called
friends had tricked me into

327
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,681
thinking that I was having
a drinking competition.

328
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:17,061
And they weren't drinking
alcohol, just me.

329
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,648
And they kept pouring shot
after shot after shot,

330
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,401
and your mom was watching this.

331
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:28,323
And I was a state, a complete
state, really in a bad way,

332
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,700
and they left me.

333
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,914
And I walked outside
and I passed out.

334
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:42,170
And your mom called an
ambulance Christmas Eve,

335
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:47,426
and I went to the hospital
and I had my stomach pumped,

336
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:52,013
and I woke up Christmas day
with your mom next to me.

337
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:58,018
And she gave me the whole
speil like your mom does

338
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,231
about how do you anything
is how you do everything.

339
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:06,361
And the people who you surround
yourself, you become them.

340
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,532
And then, I never looked back.

341
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,327
Sounds like her.

342
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,815
You want company?

343
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,360
- I don't know what
I want anymore.

344
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,446
- We're all feeling
like that right now.

345
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,073
Your mom was truly
inspirational.

346
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,745
- I'm sorry, Dean.

347
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,746
- For what?

348
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,751
- For how I left
things between us.

349
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,213
- You know that phrase
about if you love someone,

350
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,214
then set them free?

351
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,841
Don't feel bad about it.

352
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,594
- Yeah, but, you know,
I have a life in LA

353
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,180
and I had a boyfriend
at the time.

354
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,598
I shouldn't have
crossed the line.

355
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,267
- So, what, it was
a vacation fling?

356
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,020
- Dean, you know
better than that.

357
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,108
- Sheila, you are amazing,
but life doesn't always

358
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,194
lead us down the roads we want.

359
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,112
I want you to know that I
will always be there for you

360
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:35,200
in whatever capacity,
except as a stranger.

361
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,285
- Thank you, Dean.

362
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,496
- Are you going right back?

363
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,917
- Are you asking about us or me?

364
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,460
- You.

365
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,963
- I'm not going anywhere.

366
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,758
I made a commitment to my
mom and I have to fulfill it.

367
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,468
What about you?

368
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,472
- I'm gonna change the planet,

369
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,558
the way your mom inspired us to.

370
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,893
- Good, so let's start
by sorting out Guru's

371
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,688
conspiracy theories
and find my mom's work.

372
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:09,359
And finding this shark is a
priority number one on my list.

373
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,946
- But it's just a shark
doing what sharks do,

374
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,990
like any animal does to survive.

375
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,284
- Dean, you know
I'm an animal lover,

376
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,912
but if I got a chance, I would
skewer it through the heart

377
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,165
and roast it over the fire.

378
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:47,689
Each of you were here to help
my mother and the planet.

379
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,819
I'm going to stay and pick
up from where she left off.

380
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,201
If you want to
continue, please do.

381
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,871
But if you want to
move on, I understand.

382
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,541
First of all, tonight, tomorrow,

383
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,210
we start looking
for the answers.

384
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,590
- Yep.
- Cheers to that.

385
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,800
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers to that.

386
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,886
The problem lies
in two main areas.

387
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:22,223
We've got plastic use
and plastic waste.

388
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,808
- What is the difference?

389
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,602
- The plastic use is
essentially when we have these

390
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,730
uncontrolled landfills and
all the plastic is blown out

391
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,732
into the ecosystem from there.

392
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,485
The plastic waste is when
we have all these uneducated

393
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,362
people coming out of the
markets and they have all these

394
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,906
plastic bags that they're just
tossing out into the streets,

395
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,824
which gets into the environment.

396
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,410
- 13 million metric
tons of plastic

397
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:46,163
end up in the ocean each year.

398
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,834
Plastic waste kills up to
a million seabirds a year.

399
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,295
Humans are not immune
to this threat.

400
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,090
While plastics are estimated
to take up to hundreds of years

401
00:27:56,091 --> 00:28:00,970
to decompose, some of them
can break down much quicker,

402
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,517
but you know, it all ends up
in the sea, all the particles.

403
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,144
- We've trained and launched
several local cleanup

404
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,980
and recycling efforts
over the past six months.

405
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,733
But the problem lies with
litter and the use of plastic

406
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:19,530
in general, from drinking
straws to shopping bags.

407
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,324
Eliminating these plastics
will certainly put a foot

408
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:25,661
in the right direction to
rectifying the situation.

409
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,455
- Yeah, everything up
until now has been focused

410
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,957
on management of the problem.

411
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,459
The company your mother
started, Plant Plastics,

412
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,462
is focused on elimination
of the problem by replacing

413
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,965
plastic with plant-based
organic matter,

414
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,676
that was a biodegradable
lifespan of less than 30 days.

415
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:44,806
- Hm, and there lies within
the danger to us all.

416
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:51,145
Plastics is a $1.2
trillion industry.

417
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,980
To put that into perspective,

418
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,691
the tobacco industry
is 1/3 of that.

419
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,986
And we all know the tobacco
industry is pretty evil,

420
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,321
and they're responsible
for killing people

421
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,990
all around the world.

422
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,992
- This is a good
time to show you

423
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,246
a little video that
I made just before...

424
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,123
Here, take a look.

425
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,793
- Plant Plastic is dedicated
to finding a sea-plant

426
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:18,547
based material to replace
or at least reduce

427
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,217
the use of plastic
in a short term.

428
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:27,139
Our target short biodegradable
lifespan with organic remains

429
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,685
that are rich in nutrients
rather than plastic that kills.

430
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,437
The technology is within reach.

431
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:37,691
We're seeking donations and
equity funding to perfect

432
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:41,028
the process and to farm
genetically modified seaweed

433
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,698
in the planet's largest
farmland, the sea.

434
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,659
Let's plant it for the planet.

435
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,745
- I just finished
editing it last night.

436
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:53,124
It's not going anywhere, it's
just for you, for us to see.

437
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,668
But where is that lab?

438
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,129
- I don't know.

439
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,673
Amanda gave me the footage.

440
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,218
- Okay, seems like it
would be easy to find

441
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,720
a building with that logo on it.

442
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,181
- Your mother wanted
to keep that a secret.

443
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,559
Secret location.
- But why?

444
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,438
- Apparently this seaweed,
it's kinda like this special

445
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,565
endangered species
or something that you

446
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,859
can't find anywhere,
but she found it.

447
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,821
And it's her secret location
and she didn't want anybody

448
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,281
to know, especially
the plastic people.

449
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:29,159
Okay, so, anyone
have a chart of the coastline?

450
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,120
- I think I can get one
from the local dive shop.

451
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,706
Cool, let's do that.

452
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,004
- Good day.
- Hey.

453
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,590
- Hey, we're looking
for information

454
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,093
on offshore currents
around these waters.

455
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,427
We found some stuff
on the internet,

456
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,471
but local knowledge
is always best.

457
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,765
- What are you looking for?

458
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,935
- If a small boat drifted
from one to three days

459
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,437
could it have ended
up in Kimsha bay?

460
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,231
- Hm, it's a big area.

461
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,441
Many islands, lost of coastline.

462
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:05,320
- So, we will need a chart
that will cover the whole area.

463
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,697
- What are you looking for?

464
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,033
- Just the charts.
- Oh and the information

465
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,203
about the currents,
tides and waves

466
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,705
that we can't find
online please.

467
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,456
- Hm, smart girl.

468
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,333
The internet doesn't
have all the information.

469
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,960
- Yeah, neither do we.

470
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,212
- What's your business here?

471
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:26,300
- Um, we're organizing
a small eco-race,

472
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,094
boat race instead
of gas and oil.

473
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,513
- Sailboats?
- Rowboats.

474
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,514
- Uh huh.

475
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:43,525
So, the current runs this
way about three knots.

476
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,068
And if you're lucky
with a full moon,

477
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,696
it can go as fast as six knots.

478
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,324
And here, the shallow
water at high tide

479
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,659
is passable for an hour or so,

480
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,996
but the current runs.
- Mm hm.

481
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:01,085
Okay, we will take all
these and also this.

482
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,256
Okay.

483
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,654
Thank you.

484
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,863
- Well, let me know if
there's anything else

485
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,406
you would like to
know about the sea.

486
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,533
- Do you know anything
about the great white shark

487
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,286
everyone is talking about?

488
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,956
- Huh?
- Um, it's...

489
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,792
Those are small boats
and you wanna steer clear

490
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,045
from any stray shark
if you can imagine.

491
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,589
- Then you gotta steer clear
of the entire southwest area

492
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,384
in the mainland and
all the islands in it.

493
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,636
- Do these charts
cover those areas?

494
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,973
I mean, we wanna make sure
we don't go anywhere near.

495
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,182
- Yes, they do.

496
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,684
And the shark was
suspected of taking one

497
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,687
of our local fisherman
woman just the other day.

498
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:05,191
And another woman that might've
ended up in Kimsha bay.

499
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,567
- Is anyone hunting it?

500
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,735
- Well, every other game fisher

501
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,153
and local poachers are trying.

502
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:14,157
- Oh, well, hope
they will succeed.

503
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,742
Thank you.

504
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,994
Yeah.

505
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,495
- Ah, before you guys leave.

506
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,455
We would like to remind you
that we're a certified diving

507
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,874
shop since you guys will
be spending a lot of time

508
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:26,086
in the ocean and it's also
a fun skillset to have.

509
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,047
- Uh, well, we are
here for work not fun,

510
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,590
but we will consider it.

511
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,175
Thank you.
- Yeah, okay.

512
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,176
Bye.

513
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,490
- Yeah, there was an
American girl here

514
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,785
with some of her
buddy or boyfriend.

515
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,705
She was asking about
the great white shark

516
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,333
and she bought all the charts
for the western waters.

517
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,543
Mm hm.

518
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,548
Yes, I told her about getting
a diving certification.

519
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,177
Yeah, but I'll keep
an eye on her for you.

520
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,511
Yeah, sure.

521
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,060
- I could use more
processing power.

522
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,565
Would my phone help?

523
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,692
- First simulation is done.

524
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:31,693
- Okay.

525
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,948
- It's everything on 107.
- Uh huh.

526
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,786
- 109 and the
southern part of 100.

527
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,996
- How many drift days?

528
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:43,997
- One.

529
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:49,879
And the second simulation
indicates do, do, do...

530
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,381
The same three charts
as the day drift,

531
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:57,594
but actually all of 100, so.

532
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,012
- Okay.

533
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:03,141
- If your mother's body
drifted from the northern part

534
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,352
from this region right here.

535
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,853
- Uh huh.
- It could mean that she

536
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,773
might've ended right here.

537
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,110
Anywhere on chart 92, really.

538
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,821
- But we don't have a chart 92.

539
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,325
- It's only international waters

540
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,578
and a couple of
uninhabited islands.

541
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,579
- Mm hm.

542
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:30,253
Okay, uh, let's leave it
and assemble the troops.

543
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,381
- I'm famished.

544
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,509
You know what consumes more
calories than sleeping?

545
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,720
- No.
- Boom chicka wow wow.

546
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,438
- Okay, so, what we're
gonna be doing today

547
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,940
will be some classroom.

548
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,360
So, we are gonna be learning
all the theory behind diving.

549
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,736
You excited?

550
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,697
So, what we'll do
when we jump in,

551
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,199
we'll practice some skills
when we're down there, okay?

552
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,786
We'll practice how to
remove the regulator

553
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,998
and put it back in and
clear it so we're breathing.

554
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,666
Take it out, pretend
like we've dropped it,

555
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,253
put it back in and
push that button.

556
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,807
- If we are going
to find this lab,

557
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,643
the best clue so far
is my mother's body.

558
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:32,564
Where it was found is
not where she was killed.

559
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,608
Pom already ran few simulations

560
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,611
and we have two
quadrants to search.

561
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:41,448
So, Luca and Pom, you
will search this area.

562
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,701
Dean and I, we'll
search this area.

563
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,412
Guru, you will track
down Dr. Linenrose.

564
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,955
- All right, no problem.

565
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,916
But you guys, we have to
be really, really careful

566
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,959
and we can't anybody
what we're doing.

567
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,086
- Yeah, please memorize these

568
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,380
as we cannot walk
around with them.

569
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,216
Yeah?
- Let me have a look

570
00:36:58,217 --> 00:36:59,466
at this real quick.

571
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,135
I might have an id
on the search area.

572
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,931
- Don't anyone what
we are really doing.

573
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:10,310
And stick to the cover story
of organizing a boat race.

574
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,854
- Um, this looks okay.

575
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,149
- Let's see it.
- Okay, you guys go ahead,

576
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,819
as Dean and I, we have to do
final certification test today.

577
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,071
Okay?

578
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,322
Good luck.

579
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,907
- Yeah, good luck, guys.

580
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,325
I don't even swim.

581
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:29,497
And be careful of those
underwater sea aliens out there.

582
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:31,535
Sheila!

583
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,589
Why are you not helping?

584
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,383
- Well, the best to
practice is to be

585
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,135
in real life situations anyway.

586
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:49,970
You see?

587
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:50,970
No problem.

588
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,306
- Think so.

589
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,328
- What happened back there?

590
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,705
- I panicked.

591
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,791
- If this sorta
thing's gonna happen,

592
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,085
you shouldn't be in the water.

593
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,587
- Dean, you know I'm good diver.

594
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,131
I know it's been a while,

595
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:30,970
but I just have too
much on my mind now.

596
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,515
But we have to keep
looking anywhere we can.

597
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,350
- Let's just make sure
there's not another

598
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,894
search team out
looking for us, okay?

599
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:40,895
- Yeah.

600
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:05,879
- Can you remember the
last time you were here?

601
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,048
- My mom was here with us.

602
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,885
- Seems like yesterday.

603
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,642
- I hope you guys have
better luck at this.

604
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,571
- Hey, dude.
- Hey.

605
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,531
- Thank you, you're
cleaning up the beach.

606
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,032
- Well, somebody has to do it.

607
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,493
Plastic grows quicker
than mushrooms in forest.

608
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,495
- It's really tragic, but
I'm really glad you're here.

609
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,830
I wish more people
around the world

610
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,707
would think and act like you.

611
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,835
- We have to use social
media to spread the word

612
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,295
and bring awareness to this.

613
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,672
- Absolutely, it's
all about education.

614
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,840
Totally.

615
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,133
- All right, dude,
have a good great day.

616
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,426
- Yeah, you too, take care.
- Thank you.

617
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,511
Yeah.

618
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,746
- Ah, no luck?

619
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,456
- Nope, no luck.

620
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,749
- You?

621
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:34,755
- I saw some kinda sea
alien, space alien,

622
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:41,387
shark attack victim, a
dead body on the beach.

623
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,181
But you know what?

624
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:49,644
Whatever it is, it's not gonna
get me 'cause I know better.

625
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,437
- So, it was the
plastic people after us?

626
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:54,733
- No, no, no, they don't
do their own dirty laundry.

627
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,277
- What you wanna drink?

628
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,362
- A strong one.

629
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,531
Make it a double.
- Yeah.

630
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:04,243
- Lovebirds approaching.

631
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,212
- You know young people
can fall in love too.

632
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,666
- Oh, in lust also.

633
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,251
- That too.

634
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,461
You think they found him?

635
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,714
- No, I don't think so.

636
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,216
What makes you so sure?

637
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,594
- Oh, I know, I know, I know,
they, they didn't find him.

638
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,097
Nope, nope, mm mm.

639
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,182
Nope, mm mm.

640
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,478
- How do you know?
- Know what?

641
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,856
- Did you find the lab?

642
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,483
- No, not even close.

643
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,694
We didn't either.

644
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,988
- Dr. Linenrose?

645
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,574
- Guru, mate, what
have you been drinking?

646
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,160
You smell like disinfectant.

647
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:53,667
- Two, I guess two days of
drinking and not a lotta food

648
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,462
probably does
something stinky, huh?

649
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,422
- So, two days of drinking

650
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,508
and how long have you
been looking for him?

651
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,429
- Hm, um...

652
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,515
He found a
dead body on the beach.

653
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:14,145
- Well, it was a dead
body, but I don't,

654
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:18,608
maybe it was the sea aliens
or maybe it was a shark.

655
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,111
I don't know, it's yeah,
it was a dead body.

656
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,488
- Uh huh.

657
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,865
And you stopped looking
for the last person

658
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,743
that saw my mother?

659
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,332
- I know things.

660
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,334
- You know what?

661
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,419
I'm sick of you and your
conspiracy theories.

662
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,255
Sea aliens and plastic people.

663
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,382
You are no wise man.

664
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:47,428
You're a child believing
in goblins and fairies.

665
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,723
We are better off without
you and your wisdom.

666
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,602
- You all better get outta here.

667
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:59,399
- We're not going anywhere,
but you did a long time ago.

668
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,401
- I know things.

669
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,571
What do you know?

670
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,951
- I know where the lab is.

671
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,799
I need a drink.

672
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,094
Water is all
you're getting, old man.

673
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,137
- Mm.

674
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,308
You hit me.

675
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,770
- And there's no apology coming.

676
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,147
- I'm sorry.

677
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,275
I know I kinda babble
on when I'm drunk

678
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:45,070
about all the aliens and stuff.

679
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,071
I don't mean it.

680
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,159
You know I love all you guys
like you're my own children.

681
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,453
- You mean grandchildren?

682
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,163
- Well, yeah.

683
00:47:56,164 --> 00:48:00,084
And your mother, you know
I've loved her so much.

684
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:03,963
You know, not in a romantic
way, just you know,

685
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,632
her spirit, her energy.

686
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:09,218
She's just so beautiful.

687
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,929
- Where is the lab?

688
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:15,058
- Emerald Lagoon, it's
in international waters.

689
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,022
- Yeah, that's chart 92.

690
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:26,360
- Listen, that's in
super remote waters.

691
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:30,324
It's beyond jurisdiction,
little to no law enforcement.

692
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:34,660
If we go out there we're
totally on our own.

693
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:38,039
- Pom, any recent aerial images?

694
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,040
- No.

695
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,254
- I'm going.

696
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,008
Luca?

697
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,846
Dean?
- Let's do it.

698
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,100
- You're gonna need
me and my paranoia.

699
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,854
It's not just paranoia as
long as it's justified.

700
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,231
- Give us the facts.

701
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,193
No more stories.

702
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,570
- The facts are Dean,

703
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,948
we're gonna need
supplies for over a week.

704
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,408
This is really remote.

705
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,040
- We're going first
thing in the morning.

706
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:03,309
- Look at these cute
little mushrooms you guys!

707
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,186
Look, let's take a photo!

708
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,771
- Pom, stay away from this!

709
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,773
These are really poisonous.

710
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,316
They'll kill an elephant.

711
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,318
Those really
dangerous, I'm sorry.

712
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,986
I'm just trying
to save your life.

713
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,613
You guys, stay away
from those mushrooms.

714
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,114
They're really,
really poisonous.

715
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,075
All right?

716
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:21,118
You okay?

717
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,996
Don't worry about, huh?

718
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,171
Welcome to Plant Plastics.

719
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,840
- Guru, you sure?

720
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:37,009
- Yeah, this is it.

721
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,010
- Explain.

722
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,679
- All right.

723
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,139
Everything was Photoshopped.

724
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,850
The logo, everything you
saw, it was done to impress.

725
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,686
You know, to help investors,
all that kinda thing.

726
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,649
But this is where she spent
a lotta time with him.

727
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:55,487
- There is literally
no signal here.

728
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,658
Huh, I think I can extend
an antenna up there.

729
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,034
- I'm sure she can.

730
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,627
- Not what I was expecting.

731
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,171
- Yeah, it surprises
a lot of people,

732
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,591
but the real work takes
place in the lagoon here.

733
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,677
I hope so.

734
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,245
- Land shark rumble.

735
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:56,965
- Damn, Linenrose did this.

736
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,092
What?

737
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:02,928
This isn't my conspiracy theory.

738
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:06,348
He had a master plan where
he and your mother were gonna

739
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,602
buy all this and just
live happily ever after.

740
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:10,937
- Sounds a bit jealous.

741
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,608
- Hey, here's something.

742
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,194
Pom, what do you think?

743
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,239
- Let's see what
we can find on it.

744
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,328
- Hm, 50/50, platter's
not shattered.

745
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,416
- Hey.

746
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:34,168
- Those are Linenrose'.

747
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,087
- Yeah and so is the bungalow.

748
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,217
You're all trespassing.

749
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,345
Guru, you should know better.

750
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,640
I can't believe
you're still alive.

751
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,601
- I can't believe what
happened to Amanda.

752
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:51,602
It was them.

753
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,481
You're Sheila.

754
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:56,608
She spoke about you.

755
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:00,236
- Well, she never mentioned you.

756
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,197
And who's them?
- The plastic people.

757
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,823
We were on the verge
of a breakthrough

758
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:08,328
and she used to
swim every evening.

759
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,165
There hasn't been sharks
in these oceans for years.

760
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,751
They put that great
white in the water.

761
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,920
They're trying to kill us!

762
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,506
- Enough about plastic people.

763
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,343
Just tell me about the
current state of research.

764
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,345
- Amanda was working
and strengthening

765
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:29,390
the seaweed-based material
for practical use.

766
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:33,143
And to give it a biodegradable
life of less than a year.

767
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:36,355
Amanda wanted to take
the project global,

768
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,399
and now she's dead.

769
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,401
We all gotta get outta here.

770
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,861
We're gonna die if we don't.

771
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:54,999
- Shark!

772
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,091
It's definitely a
great white shark.

773
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:06,760
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

774
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:10,556
You can tell by the blue-gray
dorsal fin on the top.

775
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,765
- I don't know, I can't see.

776
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,406
How can you tell it's
a great white shark?

777
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,978
- They blend in with
that blue and gray,

778
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,439
you can't see from above.

779
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,026
- It shouldn't be within
1,000 miles of here.

780
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,070
They're sniffing
us out organically.

781
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,698
- My mother was right.

782
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,035
Going global is the
only way to stay safe.

783
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,496
Pom, try your idea with antenna,

784
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,749
and let's launch a global
campaign with GPS coordinates

785
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,085
of this lagoon and
a shark warning.

786
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,587
And let the hunters sort it out.

787
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,589
- No, don't do that!

788
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,750
You're gonna regret it!
- Hey!

789
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,179
You're all gonna die!

790
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,222
- No, no, let him go.

791
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,476
- Don't worry, I got
everything on camera.

792
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,104
- No one wanders
alone into the jungle.

793
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:03,275
Pom, tell Dean and Luca
what you need for antenna,

794
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,736
and let's see what we can
find on the hard drive.

795
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,906
Guru, help me clean
up the bungalow.

796
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:11,950
What?

797
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:17,122
- Linenrose kept
calling this his lagoon.

798
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,708
He's crazier than I am.

799
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,086
- Well, it doesn't
make you sane.

800
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:25,214
- What do you know about your
mother's financial records?

801
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,757
- Nothing.

802
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:29,218
- Pom, while you're
hacking, why don't you check

803
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,222
and see what you can find on
her mother's financial records.

804
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,307
- What are you thinking?

805
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,268
- He doesn't want us
to be here at all.

806
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,146
- I wonder where
that seaweed farm is.

807
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:44,316
- No, no one is
getting into the water

808
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:47,027
until the shark is
someone's trophy.

809
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:50,072
Protecting Gelidium
longipes is our priority,

810
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:54,243
but we can save the planet
only if we can stay alive.

811
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,244
Are we good?

812
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,290
Good, let's go.

813
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,640
- You all right?
- Yeah.

814
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,811
Um, antenna is ready.

815
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:23,605
Just make sure you put
it at the highest point.

816
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,023
- Yes, I know.
- Mm hm, go.

817
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,024
Hey, guys.

818
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,861
You ready to go?
- Yeah.

819
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,905
So, it's ready?
- Yeah, it's ready.

820
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:32,906
- Yeah.

821
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,870
Let's set it up over there.

822
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,414
- Yeah, that's a good spot.

823
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:49,591
You got the tape?
- Yep, cheers.

824
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,220
- Do you reckon the
AM broadcast range

825
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,055
is gonna be okay on this?

826
00:57:57,056 --> 00:58:00,058
- Yeah, we've got it as
broad as we can get it.

827
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,312
This might be our only
link to the outside world.

828
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:07,107
- What are we looking at
for the line of sight?

829
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,067
- I think we'll be good.

830
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:09,276
Between here and the mainland,

831
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,527
we should get very
little interference.

832
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:11,528
- Yeah?

833
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,701
All right, right that's on.

834
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,750
This just looks like farce.

835
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,128
What you thinking?

836
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,758
- Tape.
- Cheers.

837
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:37,764
Thanks.

838
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:06,626
- Do you know what?

839
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:08,877
I think I'm gonna catch you up.

840
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,629
Don't tell Sheila, I'm gonna
have a little swim to see

841
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,965
if I can locate
the gel, you know,

842
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,300
the gel-whatever
long stuff, okay?

843
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,302
- Okay, but don't take too long.

844
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,470
- No, I won't.

845
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,305
And keep it, don't tell her.

846
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,349
- All right, be careful.

847
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,601
- Yeah, I will.

848
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,444
- The antenna's
up and connected.

849
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,657
- I got the link.

850
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,200
- While you guys are
taking care of this,

851
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:41,368
Luca and I will be on the beach

852
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,662
collecting trash and firewood.

853
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,663
Okay.

854
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:13,483
- What was that?

855
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,028
- I saw something.

856
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,948
There's someone out there.

857
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,452
- Linenrose.
- Hm, hopefully.

858
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:29,708
Uh, Sheila?

859
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,549
I need a drink.

860
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,096
- Sheila, come here
and take a look.

861
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,514
I think we got some videos here.

862
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,309
I've got some footage.
- Mm hm.

863
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,978
That looks good.
- Yeah.

864
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:50,979
This one.

865
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,152
- What's happening?

866
01:00:58,613 --> 01:00:59,613
Where did it go?

867
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,408
Why it says it's not available?

868
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:04,243
Where is it going?

869
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:05,244
Why is it disappearing?

870
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:11,501
It's all gone?
- What's happening?

871
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:17,382
Just tell them to go to hell!

872
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,676
- They can't trace
our current location,

873
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,303
but they can get
to the homeland.

874
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,305
I swear this only happens
in B-rated movies.

875
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,767
CIA and NSA level stuff, so.

876
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:31,436
- Okay, um, just drop our link

877
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:34,315
and let's stay dark for a while.

878
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,152
- I didn't check this
bungalow for bugs.

879
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:07,014
Help, help!

880
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:13,229
- Dean, get out of water!
- Dean, get out!

881
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,315
Dean, get out!

882
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:29,036
Dean, get out!
- Dean, Dean!

883
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:37,295
Get out!

884
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:44,092
I couldn't hold him.

885
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,093
I saw it.

886
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,522
- And now I'm gonna
kill that shark.

887
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:59,024
- I know it's horrible,

888
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,360
but we're here to protect
nature, not kill it.

889
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,948
- Pom, are you still connected?

890
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,868
- I'll double check
when we get back in.

891
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:13,747
- We need to radio the mainland
just to report his death,

892
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,208
just so we don't look guilty.

893
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,044
- Linenrose didn't
report it either.

894
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,380
- That's exactly why
he looked guilty.

895
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,718
Let's get outta here.

896
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:33,841
Sheila!

897
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,097
You're the smartest girl I know,

898
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:41,849
but that's as stupid as it gets.

899
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,368
Your obsession with the shark

900
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:04,579
is losing focus of
the main objective,

901
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,499
which is to recover
your mother's formula.

902
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:08,958
- I know.

903
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:13,172
- And I don't wanna lose you.

904
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:18,761
- And I don't wanna
lose you either.

905
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:56,381
- Abracadabra, open Sesame.

906
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,924
We're in the hard drive.

907
01:08:57,925 --> 01:08:59,801
- Hopefully formula is there.

908
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,719
- Land deed for Emerald Lagoon.

909
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,013
- Whose name is on that?

910
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,975
- Amanda Williams.
- Who else?

911
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,226
- No one else.

912
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:09,978
This isn't his lagoon.

913
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,521
It's yours.

914
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:14,190
Her will passed ownership
of Plant Plastics

915
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:16,526
and the Emerald Lagoon to you.

916
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:19,195
- I'm starting to
appreciate good news.

917
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:20,905
- That's not good news.

918
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:23,408
That makes Linenrose
more dangerous.

919
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,410
More dangerous than
the plastic people.

920
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,287
He already thinks
this is his lagoon.

921
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:30,748
- But it's not his.
- No, it's not his lagoon.

922
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:33,459
And Sheila, what
happens if you die?

923
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,879
- Huh?
- If you die, like your will,

924
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,256
who gets all your
stuff, your inheritance?

925
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:40,425
- I don't know, I
don't have a will.

926
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,928
- I suggest you
make one right now.

927
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:46,764
- Okay, I will put a
will on my to-do list.

928
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:47,932
- To-do list?

929
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,684
Just make sure you do it now.

930
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:52,771
- Why, so I can leave
the lagoon to you?

931
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:57,358
- No, but I suggest
like a large corporation

932
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:59,777
would be a great
benefactor, like Greenway.

933
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:02,280
They specialize in
plastic alternatives.

934
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:03,781
Plus with all their
power and muscle,

935
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:05,783
they can go after
the plastic people.

936
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:07,076
I'm gonna go for a walk along

937
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:09,078
the beach and think about this.

938
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:10,997
- In about an hour,
we'll be packed and ready

939
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:12,707
to head to the mainland.

940
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,126
- All right, I'll be back
to help you guys out.

941
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:16,586
I just need to get this clear,

942
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:19,297
all this craziness
cleared outta my head.

943
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:20,591
- Don't go in.

944
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,593
- Are you guys crazy?

945
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:26,596
I don't swim!

946
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:28,682
Let alone with some
great white shark.

947
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,935
You guys are just crazy.

948
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:32,936
Man.

949
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:12,017
- Maybe check this file.

950
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,689
- I don't see Guru anywhere.

951
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:27,282
- My mom spent every
penny on this research.

952
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,992
We have to find the formula.

953
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:31,744
The Conservational Institute
of Europe wants to send a team

954
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:34,039
to check out the
Gelidium longipes.

955
01:11:35,582 --> 01:11:36,582
Huh.

956
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,544
Yeah, we need a team like that.

957
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,380
None of us are
marine biologists.

958
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:48,553
And unless we want
Linenrose to help us.

959
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:49,555
- Thumbs down.

960
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:53,891
- I'm going to look for Guru.

961
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:54,935
- Okay, yeah.

962
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:57,729
Check this one.

963
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,231
I don't know is it good idea.

964
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,733
- You own the place.

965
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:04,485
It's like owning the
land that has oil.

966
01:12:04,486 --> 01:12:06,112
- Okay, then, send
them a private message

967
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,406
with our coordinates and
ask them when they can come,

968
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:12,453
but don't sound too eager,
and not too chill either.

969
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:16,331
- Like ticking clock emoji?

970
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,459
- Let's stay emoji
free on this one.

971
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,253
Okay, okay, good.

972
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:23,254
Send that.

973
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,261
Now, let's wait.

974
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:33,807
Huh, they respond fast.

975
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:37,852
Day after tomorrow.

976
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:38,853
That's great.

977
01:12:39,563 --> 01:12:40,856
- Fireworks emoji.

978
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:45,902
I found Guru.

979
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:46,903
- That's great.

980
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:48,905
Tell them maybe if they can-

981
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:49,906
- Guys!

982
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:53,702
His body is too far
out to retrieve.

983
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:58,289
It wasn't a shark,
but someone wanted

984
01:12:58,290 --> 01:12:59,957
to make it look that way.

985
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:01,250
I found his sandal on the beach

986
01:13:01,251 --> 01:13:03,252
with a trail of blood
leading to the water.

987
01:13:03,253 --> 01:13:04,880
- Must be Linenrose.

988
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:06,798
- That's my bet.

989
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:11,135
- We have to get Guru's body.

990
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:12,470
- I agree, but it's not possible

991
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:14,430
without putting our
own lives at risk.

992
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:16,308
- We need to get outta here.

993
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:18,643
- Call a water taxi.

994
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:20,061
They won't come out at night,

995
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,605
but first light's just as good.

996
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:25,609
Sheila, we have to
report the deaths.

997
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,613
- Yes, Pom, please report it.

998
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:33,189
- I need to get outta here
before something bad happens.

999
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:37,662
- Okay, please ask water taxi

1000
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:39,580
if he can come tonight
we'll triple the rate.

1001
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:40,581
- Okay.

1002
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:52,886
- My mom, Luca, Guru, I don't
know who to blame anymore.

1003
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,306
- We're not giving up.

1004
01:13:57,307 --> 01:13:58,558
We're surviving.

1005
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:00,017
We'll come back with
the research team

1006
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:02,521
and whatever police are willing
to hunt down Dr. Linenrose.

1007
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:06,524
- Please make sure you get
Guru's body on the way back.

1008
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:08,277
- You're not staying here alone.

1009
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:13,824
- Without formula or
seaweed, we have nothing.

1010
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:19,454
- Now's not the
time to be stubborn.

1011
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:22,832
- Maybe, but if Linenrose
thinks that we left,

1012
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:26,335
he will come back and I will
be waiting for him with this.

1013
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:27,712
- Oh, so, now you're
gonna kill him

1014
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,380
like you were gonna
kill the shark?

1015
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:31,716
Murder is murder and
there's a penalty to pay.

1016
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,260
- It's gonna be self defense.

1017
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:35,470
Anyway, I'm just
gonna cripple him

1018
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,096
and let the shark do the rest.

1019
01:14:37,097 --> 01:14:39,891
Organic elimination, isn't
it how Guru would call it?

1020
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:42,477
- Sheila, you're not
thinking straight.

1021
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,187
- Dean, it's a good plan.

1022
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:46,772
What if Linenrose comes
back and kills what's left

1023
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:49,150
from the seaweed and
grow it somewhere else?

1024
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,985
- You heard Pom,
you own all this.

1025
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:53,905
- Okay, so, I will put "No
Trespassing" sign here.

1026
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,531
That will do the work.

1027
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:57,617
The problem with all the
save the planet people

1028
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:59,202
is that all the kill
the planet people thinks

1029
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:00,704
they can do whatever they want.

1030
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:03,581
- You can't meet
violence with violence.

1031
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:05,416
- Yes, I can.
- Then I'm staying with you.

1032
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:07,126
- No, you have to
be decoy with Pom.

1033
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:09,420
- Sheila, I'm staying with you.

1034
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,589
- Dean, he isn't gonna hurt me.

1035
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,090
He loved my mom.

1036
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:14,300
- How do you know
he didn't kill her

1037
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,093
and let the shark
take the blame?

1038
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:17,094
- You're an idiot.

1039
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:21,099
- Maybe, but I'm an
idiot who loves you.

1040
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:23,935
- You know what?

1041
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,521
You were just a vacation fling.

1042
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:35,488
- Are you sure
there's nothing else?

1043
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:37,574
Anything before, just
anything before it?

1044
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:39,784
Okay.

1045
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:41,495
Okay, thank you, bye.

1046
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:46,666
Any luck with taxi?

1047
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,085
No water taxi until 7:00 a.m..

1048
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:52,672
No water taxi until 7:00 a.m..

1049
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:53,840
No water taxi.

1050
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:59,554
Okay, can you check the
disk again for the formula?

1051
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,266
Did, done, none.

1052
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:10,648
- All right, the next
thing that comes through

1053
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:12,650
this door is getting skewered.

1054
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:15,111
- Are you sure there
are no hidden files?

1055
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:16,862
I'll take a look again.

1056
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:19,448
- There's so many
secrets in the sea.

1057
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:21,034
- Secrets in the sea?

1058
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,748
Secrets beneath.

1059
01:16:58,822 --> 01:16:59,906
It's the formula.

1060
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:04,702
In the most secured
old fashioned way,

1061
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:06,121
handwritten on the paper.

1062
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:10,542
- So, you'll come
in the morning?

1063
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:15,338
Sheila?
- What's going on?

1064
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:16,714
- Sheila was
thinking of staying.

1065
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:18,549
Thumbs down emoji, no.

1066
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,260
- We need to protect
that formula.

1067
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,014
- My mother made a mistake
of protecting this formula.

1068
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:28,935
Let's post it for the
whole world to see and use.

1069
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,357
- It's worth millions if
not billions if it works.

1070
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:36,025
That's not greed,
that's reality.

1071
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:37,777
Giving it away-
- It's the best way

1072
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:38,987
of protecting it.

1073
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,615
When it's out, we are all safe.

1074
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:43,616
- No link.

1075
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:46,452
7:00 a.m.?

1076
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:50,414
- I can check the antenna.

1077
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:51,957
- And leave us here alone?

1078
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:54,460
There's only one
speargun thingie.

1079
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:55,754
- Okay, we all go.

1080
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,256
- I'm not gonna shoot anyone.

1081
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:00,591
I'm gonna go hide
in the closet, okay?

1082
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:02,176
You guys just get back
as soon as you can.

1083
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:04,470
- We can do it
from the mainland.

1084
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:06,515
- No, sooner is safer.

1085
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:09,601
Until then we're all targets.

1086
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,025
- Yeah, this is where we put it.

1087
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,794
Maybe Pom can repair it.
- Mm hm.

1088
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:44,052
He's out there.

1089
01:18:45,178 --> 01:18:46,178
- Let's go.

1090
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,067
Pom!

1091
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,487
She's still breathing.

1092
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,325
- A speargun?

1093
01:19:08,326 --> 01:19:09,536
Are you serious?

1094
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:11,913
Put it over there.

1095
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:15,541
Now!

1096
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:19,546
Both of you, get out.

1097
01:19:21,339 --> 01:19:24,217
I said, out!

1098
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:32,309
Keep moving, come on.

1099
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:37,188
Let's go.

1100
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:47,491
You are as stubborn
as your mother.

1101
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:49,993
You idealist.

1102
01:19:53,538 --> 01:19:56,624
Neither you or her
have what it takes

1103
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,876
to make this world
a better place.

1104
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:03,547
And so, you're gonna
sign the company

1105
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:06,509
and the lagoon over to me.

1106
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:09,721
And then, I will let you live.

1107
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:17,187
- As simple as that?

1108
01:20:18,438 --> 01:20:20,482
Our lives for everything
my mother built?

1109
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:26,530
- Oh, by the way, I have
the paperwork ready for you.

1110
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:28,239
Just need the signature.

1111
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:33,370
- How did you know my
mother left it to me?

1112
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:37,289
- She told me.

1113
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:42,754
Then I killed her!

1114
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:48,260
- I will need a pen.

1115
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:23,795
- What happened?

1116
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:26,882
It's over.

1117
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,313
Save the world?

1118
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:45,942
- Save the world.
