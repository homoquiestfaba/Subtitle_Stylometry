1
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:55,689
- Upstairs!
- What's going on?

2
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:56,810
Who are you?

3
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:00,777
Dade! Dade!

4
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:02,736
Knock it down.

5
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:06,851
The defendant, Dade Murphy,

6
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:10,651
who calls himself 'Zero Cool',

7
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:15,457
has repeatedly committed criminal acts
of a malicious nature.

8
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:19,813
This defendant possesses
a superior intelligence,

9
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:24,219
which he uses to a destructive
and antisocial end.

10
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:33,380
His computer virus crashed 1 507 systems,
including Wall Street trading systems,

11
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:38,370
single-handedly causing a seven-point
drop in the New York stock market.

12
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:43,612
Dade Murphy, I hereby fine
your family $45,000.

13
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:48,773
I sentence you to probation.
You are forbidden to use a computer

14
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:52,894
or a touchtone telephone until
the day of your 18th birthday.

15
00:04:18,227 --> 00:04:20,741
- Dade?
- Yeah, Mom?

16
00:04:20,947 --> 00:04:22,426
What are you doing?

17
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,781
Taking over a TV network.

18
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:31,300
Finish up, honey. Go to sleep.
And happy birthday.

19
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:39,780
Security, Norm...

20
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:40,817
Norman speaking.

21
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,984
Norman. This is Mr Eddie Vedder
from Accounting.

22
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:47,941
I had a power surge here at home
that wiped out a file I was working on.

23
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:51,665
I'm in big trouble.
You know anything about computers?

24
00:04:53,147 --> 00:04:54,262
Gee...

25
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:58,858
My BLT drive on my computer
just went AWOL,

26
00:04:58,987 --> 00:05:03,139
and I have this big project
due tomorrow for Mr Kawasaki.

27
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:05,383
If I screw up, he'll make me
commit hari-kari.

28
00:05:07,547 --> 00:05:10,380
You know these Japanese
management techniques.

29
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:13,736
Could you read me
the number on the modem?

30
00:05:15,587 --> 00:05:17,976
It's a little boxy thing
with switches on it.

31
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:19,984
It lets my computer
talk to the one there.

32
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:20,937
212...

33
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:25,424
555 4240.

34
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:52,619
So-called American lndians, Latinos,
and blacks are genetically mediocre.

35
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:54,465
Yak, yak, yak.

36
00:05:55,507 --> 00:05:56,542
Get a job.

37
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:31,579
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery

38
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:33,140
which reaches from
the inner mind

39
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,464
to... The Outer Limits.

40
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:48,665
Zero...

41
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:50,897
No, wait.

42
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:03,658
Unbelievable.

43
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:05,300
A hacker.

44
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:14,943
Yeah, okay, Acid Burn. That's enough.

45
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:01,263
Shit on me!

46
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:09,853
Good morning.
Did you unpack your stuff yet?

47
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:13,574
Up all night again?

48
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:16,661
Can this wait until both
of my eyes are open?

49
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:23,251
Can I cut the electricity to his room
so he'll get some sleep?

50
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:26,897
He's been playing with his computer
all night for a week.

51
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:29,573
Yes, he could be playing with himself.

52
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:33,457
Yes, I'll ask. Dade,

53
00:08:34,262 --> 00:08:35,900
you like girls, don't you?

54
00:08:36,022 --> 00:08:38,934
Yeah. I just haven't found one
as charming as you.

55
00:08:40,862 --> 00:08:42,614
You haven't done anything stupid, right?

56
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:45,141
Right, Dade?

57
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:46,371
Right, Mom.

58
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:48,334
And I'm still a virgin.

59
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:05,816
You hooked it up to the phone,
didn't you?

60
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:09,140
Dade, turn the shower off!

61
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:14,499
You screw up again
and you won't get into college.

62
00:09:26,822 --> 00:09:29,177
I'm sorry we had to move
in your senior year.

63
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,931
I didn't want to sell the house
but I had to take this job. You know that.

64
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:36,850
You'll love New York.
It's the city that never sleeps.

65
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:16,540
I miss you, too, baby.
Claro que si.

66
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:19,138
Excuse me.

67
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,456
Chill, man. I'm talking to Venezuela.

68
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:23,860
I'm sorry. Where's the principal's office?

69
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:25,338
I can't help you, kid.

70
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,658
Do you have your transfer forms?

71
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:45,499
It's a straightforward question.

72
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:52,544
Do you speak English?

73
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,015
Sorry, you wanted...

74
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:56,578
Transfer forms.

75
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:07,178
Are you coming?

76
00:11:19,105 --> 00:11:22,859
The gym is through there
and the cafeteria is through there.

77
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:25,341
Great. Cool.

78
00:11:28,745 --> 00:11:30,144
What's your name?

79
00:11:30,345 --> 00:11:32,461
Kate. Kate Libby.

80
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,624
Here's your class.

81
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,584
My class.
I'm not in your class?

82
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:40,142
No, you're not in my class.

83
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:44,738
Give me time.

84
00:11:44,865 --> 00:11:46,378
- You new?
- Yeah.

85
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:48,584
Tell him about the pool, Kate.

86
00:11:49,785 --> 00:11:50,661
Pool?

87
00:11:50,785 --> 00:11:54,255
There's an Olympic-size
swimming pool on the roof.

88
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:56,743
Take the stairs over there.

89
00:11:57,745 --> 00:12:00,020
Yeah. Sure.

90
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:03,304
Thanks.

91
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:09,097
Hey! Hold the door!

92
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:15,100
No pool.

93
00:12:47,945 --> 00:12:50,095
Oh, my God. He found the pool.

94
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:55,747
I'm Mr Simpson.

95
00:12:55,868 --> 00:12:59,747
I'm subbing for Ms Bayless,
who was arrested at the anti-fur rally.

96
00:13:02,388 --> 00:13:07,906
I know some ofyou kids got computers
at home, but these are school property.

97
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:17,503
Chapter One.
'Designing Graphical lnterface'.

98
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:26,017
What's your interest in Kate Libby?

99
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:27,979
Academic, purely sexual?

100
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:29,746
Homicidal.

101
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:33,186
What's up, man? I'm the Phreak.

102
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:36,741
The Fantom Phreak?
The King of Nynex?

103
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:40,580
I know you play the game.

104
00:13:40,908 --> 00:13:43,263
Phreak, Phreak, Phreak.
Dude, dude, dude.

105
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:46,904
Joey! One more 'dude'
and I'll slap the shit out of you.

106
00:13:47,548 --> 00:13:51,507
You gotta stop letting your mama
dress you, man. You're hopeless!

107
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:55,383
- Check it.
- I need a handle.

108
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:59,303
I don't have an identity
until I have a handle.

109
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:02,545
You're right about that.
Check it. Friday.

110
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:09,339
Wait. How about The Master of Disaster?

111
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:11,584
You're utterly hopeless, man.

112
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,017
Ultra Laser... Doctor Doom!

113
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:32,680
Tell me what you need. Records?
Tapes? Any kind offormat or disk.

114
00:14:32,807 --> 00:14:36,277
Check this out, each of you.
Compilation tapes of my own making.

115
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:38,318
I call this 'The Greatest Zukes Album',

116
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:43,646
featuring Hendrix, Joplin,
Mama Cass, Belushi,

117
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:47,840
all great artists who asphyxiated
on their own vomit!

118
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,439
You can't get this in stores!

119
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:03,566
Please deposit $5
for the first minute.

120
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:06,643
Thank you.

121
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:08,120
No, thank you.

122
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:39,716
That's a nice score for a girl.

123
00:15:42,247 --> 00:15:43,965
Think you can do better?

124
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:47,005
I'll give it a shot.

125
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,283
Is this kid bothering you, Kate?

126
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:06,044
Could I get some room here?

127
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:08,559
Why don't you come up here?

128
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:46,562
He's good!

129
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:59,202
Well, it looks like I'm on top.

130
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:06,363
Congratulations.
No-one's ever beat her before.

131
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,404
You just made an enemy for life.

132
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:13,157
Boy meets world. Let's go.

133
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,521
- Who's that?
- Curtis.

134
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,125
What's he do?

135
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,003
You're looking at it.
He looks slick all day.

136
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,446
Joey!

137
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,124
What's up?

138
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,042
Oh, my God! You...?

139
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,008
Way cool!

140
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,963
You saw that?

141
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,689
What the hell is going on?

142
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,921
Pool on the roof must be leaking.

143
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,566
Oh, man. This is going to be good.

144
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,564
'God gave men brains larger than dogs

145
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,523
so they wouldn't hump women's legs
at cocktail parties'.

146
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,040
Ruth Libby.

147
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,279
I'm not sure your mother qualifies
as a significant 20th century author.

148
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,970
Her last book sold 2 million copies.

149
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:33,681
'Angelheaded hipsters burning for
the ancient heavenly connection

150
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,485
'to the starry dynamo
in the machinery of the night'.

151
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,679
Ginsberg.

152
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,088
Nice. Very nice.

153
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,846
He's not in this class.

154
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,439
I said give me time.

155
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,449
He's not enrolled in this class.

156
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,607
Well, he's on my list.

157
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,202
'Of all the things I've lost,
I miss my mind the most'.

158
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,963
Ozzy Osbourne.

159
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,604
You. What is your name?

160
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,168
Emmanuel Goldstein, sir.

161
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,927
You, however, are not on my list.

162
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,320
This isn't wood shop class?

163
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,610
Class crashing. Come on.

164
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,083
Now get out.

165
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,448
Thank you, sir.

166
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,409
How was school?

167
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,680
- What did we learn in school today?
- Revenge.

168
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,370
Ahh. Did we meet someone special?

169
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,283
No. No-one special.

170
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,003
I have to get back to work.
Would you please try to fill these out?

171
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:01,920
Don't worry,

172
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,927
it's only the rest of your life.

173
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,965
Anything else?
Want me to mow the lawn?

174
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,524
Oops, I forgot. New York, no grass.

175
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,519
And unpack.

176
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:40,051
You can sit at home
and do absolutely nothing

177
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:43,130
and your name goes through
17 computers a day.

178
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:46,378
'1984'? Yeah, right. That's a typo.

179
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:51,450
Orwell's here and living large.
We have no names, man. No names!

180
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:53,650
Can I score a fry?

181
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:56,453
Meet Cereal Killer.

182
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,014
As in Fruit Loops.

183
00:21:58,141 --> 00:21:59,893
But he does know things.

184
00:22:00,061 --> 00:22:01,813
Anyway, guys, listen.

185
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,577
I'm in this computer, right?
I'm looking around...

186
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:06,612
You got those Crayola books?

187
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:08,538
Yeah, technicolour rainbow.

188
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:10,851
Green one.

189
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:12,972
What is that? Let me see?

190
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:16,218
- What are these?
- International UNIX environments.

191
00:22:16,341 --> 00:22:17,933
Luscious orange.

192
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:21,417
Computer security criteria...
DOD standards.

193
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:25,215
The pink-shirt book... guide to IBM PCs.

194
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:28,538
So-called due to the nasty pink shirt
the guy wears on the cover.

195
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:30,379
Devil book, the UNIX bible.

196
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:32,969
- What's that?
- Dragon book, compiler design.

197
00:22:34,861 --> 00:22:36,658
- What's that?
- The Red book.

198
00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:39,056
NSA-trusted networks.

199
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:43,055
Otherwise known as 'The Ugly Red Book
That Won't Fit On A Shelf'.

200
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:47,333
Anyway, guys. Come on.
I'm in this computer, right.

201
00:22:47,941 --> 00:22:52,651
I'm looking around, throwing commands.
I don't know what it does or anything.

202
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:53,896
It's choice.

203
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:57,775
It's beautiful. Four hours
just messing around in there.

204
00:22:57,901 --> 00:23:00,654
Finally, I figure out...

205
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:02,379
that it's a bank.

206
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:06,814
Okay, wait. It's a bank. So, this morning,
I check the paper,

207
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:12,299
some cash machine in, like, Bumsville,
ldaho, spits out $700 into the street.

208
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:14,059
- That's kinda cool.
- That was me.

209
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:17,059
- I did that.
- You did this from your house?

210
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,054
Are you stoned or stupid?

211
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:24,015
You don't hack a bank from your house!
You get nailed by the FBl.

212
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:25,460
Are your brains in your ass?

213
00:23:25,581 --> 00:23:27,014
Don't you know anything?

214
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:29,655
It's universally stupid, man.

215
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:33,137
I don't know things because you guys
won't tell me anything. Right?

216
00:23:33,261 --> 00:23:35,092
What are the three most used passwords?

217
00:23:35,221 --> 00:23:38,770
'Love', 'Secret' and 'Sex'.

218
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:41,540
But not in that order, necessarily. Right?

219
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:46,371
Don't forget 'God'. System operators
love to use 'God'. Male ego.

220
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:51,337
To be elite, you have to do a righteous
hack, not this accidental shit.

221
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:56,010
Which means you score
one of those Gibsons, man.

222
00:23:56,141 --> 00:24:00,054
Those supercomputers they use
to do physics and look for oil.

223
00:24:00,181 --> 00:24:02,615
No way, man. Security is too tight.

224
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:05,577
Maybe. But if I wanted to hack
some heavy metal,

225
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:09,137
I'd work my way in
through some back door.

226
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:14,375
Oh, man. Wouldn't you just love
to get one of those Gibsons?

227
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:17,013
Who ate all of my fries?

228
00:24:18,581 --> 00:24:21,300
- Joey!
- No, I didn't touch your fries.

229
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:24,899
- Cereal, man. You owe me a pack.
- It was him.

230
00:24:25,901 --> 00:24:27,619
- Lay off that shit, man.
- I'm gonna hit you!

231
00:25:25,536 --> 00:25:29,609
Yes! Home run, home run. Okay, okay.

232
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:32,808
You and me, Lucy.

233
00:25:33,576 --> 00:25:35,294
We're gonna show them, baby.

234
00:25:35,776 --> 00:25:36,652
Ow!

235
00:26:07,056 --> 00:26:07,613
Mr Belford?

236
00:26:07,856 --> 00:26:11,007
My name is The Plague.

237
00:26:11,176 --> 00:26:14,486
Mr The Plague, something weird
is happening on the net.

238
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:17,130
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?

239
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:20,487
One of the Gibsons is working really hard.

240
00:26:20,616 --> 00:26:24,006
We got one person on-line
but with the workload of 10 users.

241
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:25,489
I think we got a hacker.

242
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:33,129
Okay, we need proof that we were here.

243
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,646
Yeah. Garbage. Give me Garbage.

244
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,408
Shit.

245
00:27:17,176 --> 00:27:18,370
Never fear,

246
00:27:19,336 --> 00:27:20,815
I is here.

247
00:27:21,896 --> 00:27:26,765
- I located the activity to terminal 23.
- Let's echo 23, see what's up.

248
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,527
God wouldn't be up this late.

249
00:27:57,896 --> 00:27:58,806
Shit!

250
00:27:58,936 --> 00:28:03,168
Get me the switching control centre.
I need to trace this call.

251
00:28:09,736 --> 00:28:12,330
Hold on, Mom. Hold on one second.

252
00:28:13,216 --> 00:28:16,208
- Open the door, Joseph.
- Yeah, okay.

253
00:28:18,016 --> 00:28:19,051
There you go.

254
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:21,373
Bed. Sleep.

255
00:28:22,976 --> 00:28:23,931
Now!

256
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:27,049
Sweet dreams, Joseph.

257
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:31,886
He's gone.

258
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:33,449
Did you get a trace?

259
00:28:33,616 --> 00:28:35,015
Yeah, we got him.

260
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:36,491
Good.

261
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:51,978
Nice place, huh?

262
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:58,207
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn?

263
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:01,775
- You know who he is?
- No. Don't know who he is.

264
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:02,854
Do you?

265
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:07,898
Nikon! Lord Nikon, this is...

266
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:09,338
Crash Override.

267
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:11,734
Never heard of you.
You done anything?

268
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:12,575
No.

269
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:15,933
Come on!

270
00:29:18,379 --> 00:29:21,212
What? Your Mom buy you
a 'puter for Christmas?

271
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:26,137
- Does he know anything?
- Sure. He's elite.

272
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:28,649
Come in.

273
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:37,974
- Nikon, can I crash at your place tonight?
- Again?

274
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:40,455
Yeah, sure.

275
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:47,055
Hackers penetrate and ravage

276
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:50,615
public and private computer systems,
infecting them with viruses...

277
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:52,297
Who are these guys?

278
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:56,968
Richard Gill.
Hacker enemy number one. Real boner.

279
00:29:57,939 --> 00:30:00,169
Showtime. Showtime!

280
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:05,857
- What's going on?
- Four,

281
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:09,016
three, two, one...

282
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:12,372
Welcome to our show!

283
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:13,409
Hack the Planet!

284
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:15,655
Hack the Planet!

285
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:19,695
For late night hacks, Jolt Cola,
soft drink ofthe elite hacker.

286
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,094
- Who are these guys?
- That's Razor and Blade.

287
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:24,014
Razor and Blade?

288
00:30:24,139 --> 00:30:26,494
That's right. This is a pay-phone.

289
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:28,294
Don't ask.

290
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:31,970
As you can see, this isjust a simple
micro-cassette recorder.

291
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:35,569
Hook it up to the phone,
and drop in five bucks in quarters.

292
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:38,975
Record the tone the coins make,
hang up, get your money back.

293
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:42,375
Never again pay for a service
that would be cheap,

294
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:44,729
if it weren't run
by profiteering gluttons.

295
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:48,295
Remember, hacking is more than
just a crime. It's a survival trait.

296
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:52,614
I'm a real wild child,
I'm a wild one

297
00:30:54,382 --> 00:30:55,417
I'm a wild one

298
00:30:57,262 --> 00:31:00,777
Thank you! Thank you very much!

299
00:31:03,622 --> 00:31:05,772
Joey! Joey! Thank you!

300
00:31:06,302 --> 00:31:07,132
Freeze!

301
00:31:07,262 --> 00:31:08,490
- What?
- Get out of there!

302
00:31:08,622 --> 00:31:09,418
Out!

303
00:31:09,822 --> 00:31:12,382
- Joey!
- Get in there!

304
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:14,297
Sit down!

305
00:31:14,942 --> 00:31:15,818
Lucy!

306
00:31:16,782 --> 00:31:18,056
Where are you taking her?

307
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,491
Joey!

308
00:31:29,182 --> 00:31:31,218
- How's it going, Ray?
- Looks good, sir.

309
00:31:31,342 --> 00:31:33,094
We got an uncorrupted hard drive.

310
00:31:33,422 --> 00:31:35,094
In English, please.

311
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:37,094
I didn't protect the President
for ten years

312
00:31:37,222 --> 00:31:39,053
to finish my career
feeling like an idiot.

313
00:31:39,182 --> 00:31:43,016
I'm sorry, sir. He didn't have time
to erase his computer files.

314
00:31:43,142 --> 00:31:46,851
Good. Let's finish up here.
Take him in for interrogation.

315
00:31:47,222 --> 00:31:49,099
Agent Gill, can you spare a moment?

316
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,261
Why, of course, Jennifer.

317
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:55,177
- Joey!
- How dangerous are hackers?

318
00:31:56,902 --> 00:32:01,054
Hackers penetrate and ravage public
and private computer systems,

319
00:32:01,182 --> 00:32:04,731
infecting them with viruses
and stealing sensitive materials.

320
00:32:04,862 --> 00:32:06,500
These people are terrorists.

321
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:24,501
Morning, gentlemen.

322
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:25,986
Please, be seated.

323
00:32:26,713 --> 00:32:29,591
I see we're still dressing
in the dark, Eugene.

324
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:33,383
Once again, don't call me Eugene.

325
00:32:33,513 --> 00:32:34,946
Our recent intruder

326
00:32:35,073 --> 00:32:40,227
penetrated using a superuser account,
giving him access to our whole system.

327
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,702
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.

328
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:48,505
Someone didn't bother reading my memo
on commonly used passwords.

329
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:52,421
As I meticulously pointed out,
the foremost used passwords are...

330
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:57,308
'Love', 'Sex', 'Secret' and 'God'.

331
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:01,108
So would Your Holiness
care to change her password?

332
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:04,986
A hacker planted the virus.

333
00:33:05,673 --> 00:33:07,072
Virus?

334
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:14,583
Yesterday, the ballast program
for a supertanker training model

335
00:33:14,713 --> 00:33:18,592
mistakenly thought the vessel was empty
and flooded its tanks.

336
00:33:18,753 --> 00:33:20,345
Excuse me?

337
00:33:21,073 --> 00:33:23,826
The little boat flipped over.

338
00:33:23,953 --> 00:33:28,629
A virus planted within the Gibson system
claimed responsibility.

339
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:29,822
It left a note?

340
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:39,467
Unless $5 million is transferred
to the following account in 7 days,

341
00:33:39,593 --> 00:33:42,426
I will capsize five tankers
in the Ellingson fleet.

342
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,828
- Is that...?
- That is the virus.

343
00:33:44,953 --> 00:33:46,830
Leonardo da Vinci.

344
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:51,391
We have 26 ships at sea
and don't know which ones are infected.

345
00:33:51,673 --> 00:33:55,348
Well, put the ship's ballast
under manual control.

346
00:33:55,473 --> 00:33:56,872
There's no such thing any more.

347
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,302
These ships are totally computerised.

348
00:33:59,433 --> 00:34:01,822
They rely on satellite navigation

349
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:06,549
which links them to our network,
and the virus, wherever they are.

350
00:34:06,913 --> 00:34:08,631
What are we supposed to do?

351
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:12,865
Luckily, you have a gifted
and talented security officer.

352
00:34:12,993 --> 00:34:16,622
I traced the hacker's call.
The Secret Service picked him up.

353
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:21,190
I'll search his files for the original
virus code and eliminate it.

354
00:34:21,313 --> 00:34:24,464
We expect you
to get on this right away.

355
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:29,305
- How soon?
- As fast as I can.

356
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:33,745
This is common in corporations
as large as ours. Don't worry about it.

357
00:34:34,793 --> 00:34:37,307
The Secret Service
is helping us out, 100 percent.

358
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:40,227
We'll be in touch.

359
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:42,465
What the hell was that all about?

360
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:45,790
I had to move fast.
The hacker copied my garbage file.

361
00:34:45,913 --> 00:34:46,868
What?

362
00:34:47,113 --> 00:34:50,503
I created da Vinci so we could
get the Secret Service

363
00:34:50,633 --> 00:34:53,943
to arrest the hacker and seize
the equipment, which we can't do alone.

364
00:34:54,073 --> 00:35:00,308
- I don't want to go to jail for this.
- Relax. Think about the $25 million.

365
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:06,542
But you created a virus that's going to
cause a worldwide ecological disaster.

366
00:35:06,673 --> 00:35:09,506
Just to arrest some hacker kid?

367
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:11,351
Basically, yes.

368
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:14,752
Jesus! You're sick, Eugene.

369
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,222
I'll take care of this.

370
00:35:17,353 --> 00:35:21,346
I can cancel it any time.
I don't need the code.

371
00:35:21,673 --> 00:35:23,789
What better way to confiscate the disk

372
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,825
and find out how much of
the garbage file was copied.

373
00:35:27,953 --> 00:35:28,908
Get it!

374
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:32,953
Why did I ever trust you?

375
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:38,546
Get the file, otherwise
you'll lose all your toys.

376
00:35:45,913 --> 00:35:49,701
Did you find the virus program
on the disks we confiscated?

377
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:54,146
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.

378
00:35:57,033 --> 00:36:00,548
Then he stashed it somewhere,
or he has an accomplice.

379
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:07,789
We'll release him. Keep tight surveillance
and see if he leads us to your disk.

380
00:36:13,073 --> 00:36:17,032
Unit 3, outside suspect
Joey Pardella's apartment.

381
00:36:17,153 --> 00:36:20,111
Suspect still grounded... by his mother.

382
00:36:20,753 --> 00:36:21,947
Listen to this bullshit.

383
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:26,824
'This is our world now. The world
of the electron and the switch,

384
00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:28,909
'the beauty ofthe baud.

385
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:33,629
'We exist without nationality,
skin colour or religious bias.

386
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:36,825
'You wage wars, murder,
cheat, lie to us,

387
00:36:36,953 --> 00:36:40,502
'and try to make us believe it's for
our own good, yet we're the criminals.

388
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:44,945
'Yes, I am a criminal.
My crime is that of curiosity.

389
00:36:45,073 --> 00:36:49,510
'l am a hacker
and this is my manifesto.'

390
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,425
Right? Manifesto?

391
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:53,548
'You may stop me,

392
00:36:53,673 --> 00:36:56,346
'but you can't stop us all.'

393
00:36:57,433 --> 00:36:58,548
That's cool.

394
00:36:58,673 --> 00:37:00,664
- Cool?
- Yeah, cool.

395
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:01,908
You think it's cool?

396
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:06,823
- It's cool.
- It's not cool. It's commie bullshit.

397
00:37:14,593 --> 00:37:16,584
Can I crash at your place tonight?

398
00:37:17,553 --> 00:37:18,781
What's with him?

399
00:37:18,913 --> 00:37:21,950
His parents missed Woodstock
and he's been making up for it since.

400
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,825
You hear about Joey's bust?

401
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:28,272
Probably had something to do
with that bank in ldaho.

402
00:37:28,473 --> 00:37:30,225
You think he could hack a Gibson?

403
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:34,664
- Did you talk to him?
- No. His mom says he's grounded

404
00:37:34,793 --> 00:37:38,627
for his next three lifetimes. And no
'consorting with computer friends'.

405
00:37:38,993 --> 00:37:41,029
The Secret Service is out to get him.

406
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:43,867
Want to go to a big party tonight?

407
00:37:44,433 --> 00:37:45,627
It's at Kate's.

408
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:47,828
I thought so.

409
00:37:49,273 --> 00:37:50,547
A little pelvis.

410
00:37:51,513 --> 00:37:52,582
A little pelvis.

411
00:38:10,028 --> 00:38:11,905
What the hell are you doing?

412
00:38:12,308 --> 00:38:13,457
Plague!

413
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:14,942
Plague!

414
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:16,944
Gill.

415
00:38:17,868 --> 00:38:19,381
I think we got something.

416
00:38:19,748 --> 00:38:22,660
Yuk!... Hard copy!

417
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:25,861
Dade Murphy.

418
00:38:27,668 --> 00:38:29,704
- Secret Service!
- Don't move!

419
00:38:29,828 --> 00:38:30,499
What are you...?

420
00:38:30,628 --> 00:38:31,902
Shut up!

421
00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:35,977
What are you doing? Get off me!

422
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:38,898
God!

423
00:38:39,508 --> 00:38:42,147
Sit on the bed and keep your hands
where we can see them.

424
00:38:44,028 --> 00:38:46,223
The year was 1988.

425
00:38:46,348 --> 00:38:50,944
A nasty virus crashed
1 ,500 systems in one day.

426
00:38:53,908 --> 00:38:55,387
1 ,507.

427
00:38:55,508 --> 00:38:57,226
It got you 7 years' probation.

428
00:38:58,108 --> 00:39:00,668
No computer. No touchtone phones.

429
00:39:02,188 --> 00:39:04,656
Must have been hell, huh, Zero Cool?

430
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:10,580
A virus has been planted in
the Ellingson Mineral computer system.

431
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:13,017
You were our prime suspect.

432
00:39:13,148 --> 00:39:16,458
Till we trashed your stuff
and found no trace of it.

433
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:21,139
We believe that Joey Pardella
is involved in this Ellingson virus.

434
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:26,422
He or his accomplice has a disk that
Mr Belford needs to disable that virus.

435
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:29,504
We want you to help us find it.

436
00:39:29,628 --> 00:39:30,185
Gill.

437
00:39:42,348 --> 00:39:43,417
Loser.

438
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:48,628
I can't believe you were only 1 1
when you wrote this.

439
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:53,704
It's quite an impressive virus.

440
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:57,143
Dade.

441
00:39:58,868 --> 00:40:03,578
I know how you might feel about narking
on your friends, but... we're hackers.

442
00:40:03,748 --> 00:40:08,185
For us, there's no such thing
as family and friends.

443
00:40:08,388 --> 00:40:12,984
We're each our own country,
with temporary allies and enemies.

444
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:17,580
Let's make a treaty.

445
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:21,697
I'm sorry. Who are you?

446
00:40:26,348 --> 00:40:28,418
I'm the one who understands you.

447
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:31,828
Now, can we be allies?

448
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:37,538
Nah. I don't play well with others.

449
00:40:52,588 --> 00:40:54,977
Shit! Come on!

450
00:40:55,468 --> 00:40:58,221
Watch which friends you do play with.

451
00:40:58,348 --> 00:41:03,980
With your record, you could land in jail
or get expelled. No college. No future.

452
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:08,537
Exiled from everyone
and everything you love.

453
00:41:11,908 --> 00:41:13,500
I'll be in touch.

454
00:41:14,948 --> 00:41:17,018
He's fine.
Oh, and Dade,

455
00:41:18,548 --> 00:41:21,381
- try to stay out of trouble, okay?
- Blow me.

456
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:23,863
Thank you.

457
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:31,234
Her Mom makes big bucks
writing books for women.

458
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:34,829
Stuff like 'Women Who Love Men
Who Are Emotional Amoebae'.

459
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:36,707
That explains a lot.

460
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:56,190
Big man, stepping in.
Coming through.

461
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:59,836
Big man, big boots.
You look good, girl.

462
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:07,598
- Yo, what's up, Nikon?
- In the house, man. Thanks.

463
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,518
Dade, man. You made it.

464
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,631
Houston, we have lift-off.

465
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:15,637
Three o'clock. Check it.
Don't look right away!

466
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,238
Look at her, man.

467
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:25,794
Lisa Blair.
26 East 7th Street, apartment 16.

468
00:43:25,919 --> 00:43:27,147
555 4817.

469
00:43:27,279 --> 00:43:28,075
Boom!

470
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:31,589
- How'd you know that?
- I got a photographic memory.

471
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,468
It's a curse.

472
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:34,833
Lisa!

473
00:43:40,439 --> 00:43:45,513
Oh! Look at that pooper, man.
Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right.

474
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,473
Hi, my name's Vicki and I'm an addict.

475
00:43:55,919 --> 00:43:58,387
Hi. My name's Hank and I'm an addict.

476
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:02,038
My name's Joey, but...

477
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:04,194
I'm not an addict.

478
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:06,513
No, really. Listen.

479
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:08,311
I got in trouble with my computer.

480
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:12,318
My lawyer told the judge I'm an addict,
but I'm not addicted to my computer.

481
00:44:12,759 --> 00:44:13,635
No, really.

482
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:15,428
I'm not an addict.

483
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:16,635
I'm not.

484
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:19,513
Can I get some more coffee?

485
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,314
Yo! Check this out.
This is insanely great.

486
00:44:33,439 --> 00:44:35,509
It's got a 28.8 bps modem.

487
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:38,437
- Yeah? Display?
- Active matrix.

488
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:40,595
A million psychedelic colours.

489
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,232
This baby is sweet.

490
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,792
- I want it.
- I want it to have my children.

491
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,876
- Bet it looks crispy in the dark.
- Hit the light.

492
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:06,468
Shit!

493
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:09,670
Come on. Get out.

494
00:45:09,799 --> 00:45:12,074
- Was that her top?
- One-handed.

495
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:13,753
Difficulty rating?

496
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,834
Seven.

497
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:22,632
Wow!... Burn's wetware
matches her software.

498
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:25,558
Burn?

499
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:28,512
What are you doing here?

500
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:31,358
We're sorry! Just looking
at your fly laptop.

501
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:32,878
It's hype, you know.

502
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:34,398
You're in the butter zone now, baby.

503
00:45:37,439 --> 00:45:38,713
Yeah, it is.

504
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:41,672
I want to triple the RAM.

505
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:46,354
Leopard boy and the deceptor cons.

506
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,194
Kate! You're not going into that
computer shit now, right?

507
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:54,273
Later, babe.

508
00:45:55,799 --> 00:45:58,597
- Yeah, right.
- The sensitive type.

509
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,078
What's he doing here?

510
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:03,757
He's my guest, Burn.

511
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:05,268
You're Acid Burn?!

512
00:46:05,399 --> 00:46:07,196
You booted me out of OTV.

513
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:10,553
- What?
- I'm Crash Override.

514
00:46:11,279 --> 00:46:13,998
You're the moron
who's been invading my turf?

515
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:16,793
Whoa, whoa! Crash...

516
00:46:16,919 --> 00:46:17,908
and Burn!

517
00:46:30,194 --> 00:46:32,344
Murphy kid turn you down?

518
00:46:32,474 --> 00:46:38,629
I disguised myself as an Alabama State
Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.

519
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,982
Pervert.

520
00:46:40,674 --> 00:46:42,551
What are you talking about?

521
00:46:44,914 --> 00:46:48,589
The FBI computer holds files
on 20 million Americans.

522
00:46:49,314 --> 00:46:51,111
I just hacked into it.

523
00:46:51,594 --> 00:46:53,107
Congratulations.

524
00:46:53,754 --> 00:46:57,588
I have access to every piece of data
stored on Dade Murphy's parents.

525
00:46:58,594 --> 00:47:03,793
His parents separated five years ago,
reconciled, then divorced last year.

526
00:47:03,914 --> 00:47:05,029
Custody battle.

527
00:47:05,154 --> 00:47:07,270
Boy chose to go with his mother.

528
00:47:07,634 --> 00:47:08,589
So?

529
00:47:09,874 --> 00:47:14,902
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.

530
00:47:59,933 --> 00:48:01,491
What the hell are you doing?

531
00:48:02,373 --> 00:48:04,125
It's cool, I'm just looking.

532
00:48:05,613 --> 00:48:08,173
- It's too much machine for you.
- Yeah?

533
00:48:18,853 --> 00:48:21,048
I hope you don't screw like you type.

534
00:48:27,693 --> 00:48:29,365
It has a killer refresh rate.

535
00:48:30,693 --> 00:48:34,242
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.

536
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:37,524
It's not just the chip. It has a PCI bus.

537
00:48:37,653 --> 00:48:39,689
But... you knew that.

538
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:41,885
Indeed.

539
00:48:42,293 --> 00:48:44,409
RISC architecture is going
to change everything.

540
00:48:44,533 --> 00:48:46,888
Yeah. RISC is good.

541
00:48:51,693 --> 00:48:54,730
Sure this sweet machine's
not going to waste?

542
00:48:56,973 --> 00:48:59,282
Crash Override. What was it?

543
00:48:59,573 --> 00:49:03,566
'Mess with the best, die like the rest'?

544
00:49:04,213 --> 00:49:05,168
Yeah.

545
00:49:09,733 --> 00:49:11,052
Are you challenging me?

546
00:49:11,173 --> 00:49:12,208
Name your stakes.

547
00:49:13,253 --> 00:49:16,404
If I win, you become my slave.

548
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,368
Your slave?

549
00:49:19,893 --> 00:49:21,042
You wish.

550
00:49:21,973 --> 00:49:24,851
You'll do shit work.
Scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.

551
00:49:24,973 --> 00:49:26,804
Deal. And if I win?

552
00:49:26,933 --> 00:49:29,163
Make it my first born.

553
00:49:29,293 --> 00:49:31,602
- Make it our first date.
- You won't win.

554
00:49:32,773 --> 00:49:33,922
And you have to smile.

555
00:49:34,053 --> 00:49:36,613
I don't do dates.

556
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:40,405
But I don't lose, either. So you're on.

557
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:49,252
Here's the deal, the chosen contest:

558
00:49:49,373 --> 00:49:53,002
To hassle Secret Service Agent
Richard Gill and get one back for Joey.

559
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:02,372
Our decisions are final
by a vote oftwo to one. No appeals.

560
00:50:05,093 --> 00:50:08,324
The duel will last
until we declare a winner.

561
00:50:11,733 --> 00:50:16,284
Use only the access codes
and passwords in your collection.

562
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:17,766
No help from us.

563
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,206
Talkin' to me?

564
00:50:26,173 --> 00:50:27,526
Any questions?

565
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:31,202
Yeah. Who's going to notify
his next of kin?

566
00:51:22,293 --> 00:51:24,363
He's in the personal ads.

567
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:31,684
'Disappointed white male, cross-dresser,
looking for discreet friend

568
00:51:31,813 --> 00:51:34,043
'to bring dreams to reality.

569
00:51:34,173 --> 00:51:39,566
'Leather, lace and water sports.
Transvestites welcome.'

570
00:51:39,693 --> 00:51:42,765
I know where you can stick it.

571
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,445
Ijust want to lick
your earlobes and your lips.

572
00:51:47,053 --> 00:51:49,203
You want to lick something? Lick this!

573
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:52,051
That's why they call me Stallion.

574
00:51:52,173 --> 00:51:53,526
That's disgusting!

575
00:51:53,853 --> 00:51:55,491
My heart is steaming for you...

576
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:58,930
- ..spank you with...
- I'll spank your ass!

577
00:51:59,093 --> 00:52:01,288
- ..turn you over and...
- Agghh!

578
00:52:01,813 --> 00:52:02,484
Animal!

579
00:52:45,256 --> 00:52:48,407
Hey!... Hey! Do you know who I am?

580
00:52:48,536 --> 00:52:50,333
Do you know who I am?

581
00:53:12,536 --> 00:53:16,688
This is Accounting, sir. You inquired
about Agent Richard Gill?

582
00:53:16,816 --> 00:53:17,646
Yes.

583
00:53:17,776 --> 00:53:21,451
- Our records indicate he's deceased.
- I'm what?

584
00:53:21,576 --> 00:53:22,850
- Dead.
- Dead?

585
00:53:22,976 --> 00:53:26,013
Yeah. Like rigor mortis, habeas corpus.

586
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:29,253
- Very impressive.
- Superhero-like, even.

587
00:53:30,256 --> 00:53:31,325
Yeah, whatever.

588
00:53:32,336 --> 00:53:33,564
What's the score?

589
00:53:36,576 --> 00:53:37,531
Tie.

590
00:53:39,576 --> 00:53:42,010
Come on. Due to Mr Gill's
untimely demise,

591
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:45,287
- you'll have to improvise the next round.
- Right.

592
00:53:46,296 --> 00:53:47,649
I win,

593
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,455
you wear a dress on our date.

594
00:53:51,536 --> 00:53:52,491
And if I win,

595
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,415
so do you.

596
00:53:59,216 --> 00:54:00,092
Deal.

597
00:54:36,896 --> 00:54:37,726
Dade.

598
00:54:39,136 --> 00:54:41,889
I didn't know your size,
so... I guessed.

599
00:54:43,896 --> 00:54:45,454
You will stick with the deal?

600
00:54:56,045 --> 00:54:57,000
Thanks.

601
00:55:09,965 --> 00:55:14,277
You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool?
Let me explain...

602
00:55:14,405 --> 00:55:16,316
the new world order.

603
00:55:16,445 --> 00:55:19,642
Governments and corporations
need people like you...

604
00:55:19,765 --> 00:55:21,357
and me.

605
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:25,842
We are the samurai,
the keyboard cowboys.

606
00:55:25,965 --> 00:55:27,796
And those otherpeople out there,

607
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:31,884
who have no idea what's going on,
are the cattle.

608
00:55:32,005 --> 00:55:34,041
Moo.

609
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:38,078
I need your help. You need my help.

610
00:55:38,205 --> 00:55:41,083
Let me help you earn your spurs.

611
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:43,394
Think about it.

612
00:55:44,805 --> 00:55:47,763
Enjoy the laptop... Cool.

613
00:55:48,965 --> 00:55:50,921
Tell me where the disk is.

614
00:55:57,808 --> 00:55:59,605
You look pitiful.

615
00:56:01,368 --> 00:56:05,725
Okay, you're not grounded any more.

616
00:56:31,008 --> 00:56:33,806
- Yo, what's up?
- I gotta talk to you, man. Listen.

617
00:56:33,928 --> 00:56:37,523
- I copied a garbage file.
- So? A garbage file has shit in it.

618
00:56:37,648 --> 00:56:39,718
It's hot or something.

619
00:56:39,848 --> 00:56:44,364
Joey, a garbage file holds odd data.
Stuff that's been erased.

620
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:46,399
I copied it from Ellingson, okay?

621
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:49,247
They're asking me about it.
Will you take a look for me?

622
00:56:52,328 --> 00:56:53,761
Shit, Joey. You got a tail.

623
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:56,123
Shit!

624
00:57:39,608 --> 00:57:42,361
I am watching you.

625
00:57:45,448 --> 00:57:46,597
Wake up.

626
00:57:48,408 --> 00:57:49,443
Ramon?

627
00:57:49,768 --> 00:57:52,885
Wake up. Ramon, it's time for school.

628
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:54,883
Come on.

629
00:57:57,408 --> 00:57:59,444
Stick your hands up! Don't move!

630
00:57:59,568 --> 00:58:00,683
Deja vu!

631
00:58:00,808 --> 00:58:04,357
You're under arrest under the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

632
00:58:05,008 --> 00:58:06,123
!La computadora de mierda!

633
00:58:06,248 --> 00:58:08,045
!Que te dije de no estar
jugando con esa

634
00:58:08,168 --> 00:58:10,443
- computadora!
- What are you waiting for? Arrest me!

635
00:58:21,368 --> 00:58:23,518
You get one call.

636
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:26,042
Uno.

637
00:58:26,808 --> 00:58:28,366
Understand?

638
00:58:42,848 --> 00:58:44,679
Operator Services?

639
00:58:44,808 --> 00:58:46,764
- I'm having trouble with a number.
- What number, please?

640
00:58:46,888 --> 00:58:48,765
555 4202.

641
00:58:48,888 --> 00:58:50,401
- Just one moment.
- Thank you.

642
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,998
- Hello?
- It's me. I'm freaking.

643
00:58:54,128 --> 00:58:58,246
Joey really hacked into Ellingson.
He gave me the disk he copied

644
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,087
and now I'm injail
for some serious shit!

645
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:04,723
Stuff I didn't even do, like inserting
a virus called 'da Vinci'?

646
00:59:04,848 --> 00:59:06,759
And they keep asking about you guys.

647
00:59:06,888 --> 00:59:08,401
- Think they're gonna bust us?
- Yeah.

648
00:59:08,528 --> 00:59:11,440
You better figure out what's on that disk
'cause we're being framed.

649
00:59:11,568 --> 00:59:13,604
It's in the place where
I put that thing once.

650
00:59:48,139 --> 00:59:48,696
Hi.

651
00:59:50,859 --> 00:59:52,133
Now I see what all the fuss is about.

652
00:59:58,899 --> 01:00:00,378
You have company.

653
01:00:03,819 --> 01:00:05,889
- Nice room.
- We need your help.

654
01:00:07,819 --> 01:00:09,935
Do my ears deceive me?

655
01:00:12,379 --> 01:00:15,496
No, no. Truce, you guys.
We got a higher purpose here.

656
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:17,775
A wake-up call for
the Nintendo generation.

657
01:00:17,899 --> 01:00:19,537
We demand free access to data.

658
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:22,219
Well, it comes with some responsibility.

659
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:26,498
'When I was a child, I spake as a child,
I thought as a child.

660
01:00:26,619 --> 01:00:29,531
'But when I became a man,
I put away childish things'.

661
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:33,051
What? It's Corinthians One,

662
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:36,728
Chapter 1 3, verse 1 1 , you know?
Come on.

663
01:00:40,979 --> 01:00:43,254
Phreak and Joey are being framed.

664
01:00:43,379 --> 01:00:45,654
Can you help us find out
what's on this disk?

665
01:00:45,859 --> 01:00:46,848
I can't.

666
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:50,456
Everybody who touches that disk
gets arrested. I can't risk arrest.

667
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:51,728
I'm sorry.

668
01:00:55,859 --> 01:00:58,009
Maybe I should go to the bathroom.

669
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:06,932
What is it with you?

670
01:01:07,899 --> 01:01:12,256
We're supposed to be on the same side
and we really need your help.

671
01:01:13,819 --> 01:01:15,571
I really need your help.

672
01:01:17,779 --> 01:01:20,088
I'm sorry. I can't.

673
01:01:24,379 --> 01:01:25,858
Could you copy the disk?

674
01:01:25,979 --> 01:01:29,767
And just hide it in case we get busted
so we have a copy for our lawyers.

675
01:01:29,899 --> 01:01:31,776
Something that hasn't been
tampered with.

676
01:01:36,219 --> 01:01:38,175
You guys help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

677
01:01:38,299 --> 01:01:39,732
Cereal has.

678
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:48,008
Okay. I'll copy it.

679
01:01:48,219 --> 01:01:49,129
Thank you.

680
01:01:56,126 --> 01:01:57,923
The girl. The girl has the disk I need.

681
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:01,521
I told you.
I don't play well with others.

682
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:04,117
Turn on your laptop.

683
01:02:04,926 --> 01:02:06,996
Set it to receive a file.

684
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:18,565
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon
in the state of Washington.

685
01:02:19,926 --> 01:02:23,123
Forgery, embezzlement,
two drug convictions

686
01:02:23,246 --> 01:02:27,319
plus jumping parole. Once arrested,
she will have no trial,

687
01:02:27,446 --> 01:02:31,485
she will notpass 'Go',
she will go directly tojail.

688
01:02:31,606 --> 01:02:37,238
Then I change this file back to the original
and your mom disappears.

689
01:02:37,366 --> 01:02:38,515
That's bullshit.

690
01:02:39,126 --> 01:02:42,880
What can I tell you?
Computers never lie, kid.

691
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:49,398
Your mom will be arrested,
handcuffed and later strip-searched.

692
01:02:49,526 --> 01:02:52,086
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.

693
01:02:52,926 --> 01:02:55,121
Kid, don't threaten me.

694
01:02:55,566 --> 01:03:00,003
There are worse things than death...
and I can do all of them.

695
01:03:37,806 --> 01:03:38,921
Talk to me.

696
01:03:39,046 --> 01:03:42,436
I got it. But Kate didn't know
what's on it,

697
01:03:42,566 --> 01:03:44,477
she came to me to figure it out.

698
01:03:45,326 --> 01:03:48,045
She didn't plant the virus.
You leave her alone.

699
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:51,841
Don't worry, kid. Ifshe's innocent,

700
01:03:51,966 --> 01:03:53,399
she'll be fine.

701
01:03:55,006 --> 01:03:57,645
Your mommy's safe now, okay?

702
01:05:16,993 --> 01:05:17,948
Kate, Listen.

703
01:05:18,633 --> 01:05:19,748
Hold on.

704
01:05:19,873 --> 01:05:22,512
- I have to tell you something.
- Hold on!

705
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:25,910
- It's so lean and clean.
- Looks like a hacker wrote it.

706
01:05:26,553 --> 01:05:28,225
Come here. Look at this.

707
01:05:28,793 --> 01:05:30,545
This thing is tense.

708
01:05:31,513 --> 01:05:33,105
That's ill, man.

709
01:05:33,553 --> 01:05:34,986
It's incomplete.

710
01:05:36,273 --> 01:05:39,709
This'll take forever to figure out.
I'll make some coffee.

711
01:05:42,913 --> 01:05:44,346
Tag, you're in.

712
01:07:01,353 --> 01:07:05,062
- It's not a virus. It's a worm.
- What's it eat?

713
01:07:05,193 --> 01:07:06,911
It nibbles. You see all of this?

714
01:07:07,033 --> 01:07:10,184
This is all of Ellingson's
financial transactions.

715
01:07:10,313 --> 01:07:13,703
From million dollar deals
to $10 some guy pays for gas.

716
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:15,744
The worm eats a few cents
from each transaction.

717
01:07:15,873 --> 01:07:18,262
No-one's caught it because
the money isn't really gone.

718
01:07:18,393 --> 01:07:20,145
It's just data being shifted around.

719
01:07:20,273 --> 01:07:24,312
And when the worm's ready, it zips out
with the money and erases its tracks.

720
01:07:24,433 --> 01:07:26,788
Joey got cut off before he got to that part.
Check it out.

721
01:07:26,913 --> 01:07:30,826
Here it's already running
at twice the speed as when it started.

722
01:07:30,953 --> 01:07:33,547
- At this rate, the run ends in...
- ..two days.

723
01:07:33,673 --> 01:07:38,110
- It's already eaten about...
- ..21 .8 million bucks.

724
01:07:39,353 --> 01:07:42,231
Whoever wrote this
needs someone to take the fall.

725
01:07:42,353 --> 01:07:45,026
That's Phreak and Joey and us.

726
01:07:45,153 --> 01:07:49,226
We have to find out where the money's
going before the worm disappears,

727
01:07:49,353 --> 01:07:51,583
so we can find out who created it.

728
01:07:51,713 --> 01:07:52,907
I know who wrote it!

729
01:07:53,353 --> 01:07:54,229
What?

730
01:07:54,353 --> 01:07:55,945
This Ellingson security creep.

731
01:07:56,513 --> 01:07:59,505
I gave him a copy of the disk
you gave me.

732
01:07:59,633 --> 01:08:00,509
You what?

733
01:08:00,633 --> 01:08:02,271
I didn't know what was on it.

734
01:08:02,393 --> 01:08:05,703
Oh, man! That's universally stupid, man.

735
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:07,346
Yo, man. You're an amateur.

736
01:08:08,913 --> 01:08:09,982
Why did he come to you?

737
01:08:10,113 --> 01:08:11,831
I've got a record.

738
01:08:12,233 --> 01:08:13,791
I was Zero Cool.

739
01:08:13,913 --> 01:08:19,863
Zero Cool crashed 1 ,507 systems
in one day. Biggest crash in history.

740
01:08:19,993 --> 01:08:22,905
Front page New York Times,
August 10, 1988.

741
01:08:24,153 --> 01:08:25,825
I thought you was black, man.

742
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:28,668
Yo, man, this is Zero Cool!

743
01:08:29,513 --> 01:08:30,582
That's far out!

744
01:08:30,713 --> 01:08:32,032
This is Zero Cool, man!

745
01:08:33,393 --> 01:08:34,906
Yeah, that's great.

746
01:08:35,313 --> 01:08:36,223
There goes MIT.

747
01:08:36,353 --> 01:08:38,389
- I'll make it up!
- How?

748
01:08:39,593 --> 01:08:40,787
I'll hack the Gibson.

749
01:08:40,913 --> 01:08:42,869
They'll trace you like that, man.

750
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,711
The cops will find you
with a smoking gun.

751
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,061
Fucked if I care, man.

752
01:08:46,193 --> 01:08:49,265
Even with the password,
it'd take you ten minutes to get in,

753
01:08:49,393 --> 01:08:50,951
then you'd have to find the files.

754
01:08:51,073 --> 01:08:53,268
The cops would have you in five minutes.

755
01:08:53,393 --> 01:08:55,953
Oh, wow! We are fried!

756
01:08:56,073 --> 01:08:58,507
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.

757
01:08:58,633 --> 01:09:00,669
With me, we can do it in seven.

758
01:09:00,873 --> 01:09:03,341
I help, we do it in six.

759
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:07,546
I gotta save all your asses!
I help, we do it in five minutes.

760
01:09:07,673 --> 01:09:10,062
Okay. Let's go shopping.

761
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,335
You know,

762
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:43,775
if I didn't live by a strict code of honour,
I might take advantage of this situation.

763
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,856
Erotically, as it were.

764
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,331
All right. Hold it right there.

765
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:17,654
Shit!

766
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,736
My subway defence system.

767
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,739
He's way down there.

768
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:29,415
Ta-da!

769
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:33,296
- Yo, brain-dead... the manual!
- Oops!

770
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:40,055
Hey!

771
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:41,575
Truck!

772
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:46,575
Find it?

773
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:51,017
The phone's all right. The problem
must be somewhere else.

774
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:33,373
They had a large chunk
of the garbage file?

775
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:39,496
- How much do they know?
- Enough to implicate us.

776
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:42,180
You said the worm was untraceable.

777
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:45,133
Yeah... to civilians.
But they're hackers.

778
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:48,775
Don't worry.
We just launch the da Vinci virus.

779
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:52,218
- Then they'll all be put away.
- Launch the da Vinci virus?

780
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:55,935
- You can't do that.
- No-one believes the guilty.

781
01:11:56,060 --> 01:12:01,692
By the time they realise the truth,
we'll be long gone with all our money.

782
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:05,412
Look, there is no right and wrong.

783
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:08,373
There is only fun... and boring.

784
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:12,776
A 30-year prison sentence
sounds pretty dull to me.

785
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,499
Who do you prefer serves it?

786
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:17,088
Us... or them?

787
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:39,379
Unless $5 million is transferred
to the following account in seven days,

788
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,412
I will capsize five Ellingson tankers.

789
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,815
The virus goes off
tomorrow at 10.30AM,

790
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:47,534
and those hackers tried
to get into our system again.

791
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:50,538
I insist you take more strenuous action

792
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:54,448
or Ellingson Mineral will hold
the Secret Service responsible.

793
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:01,256
Get me arrest warrants
on Kate Libby, alias Acid Burn,

794
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,689
Emmanuel Goldstein,
alias Cereal Killer,

795
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:06,653
Dade Murphy,
alias Crash Override, also known as

796
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:11,490
Zero Cool, and Paul Cook,
alias Lord Nikon.

797
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,175
Pick them up tomorrow at 9.00AM.

798
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:16,929
Snoop on to them

799
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:19,016
as they snoop on to us.

800
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:28,411
- Yeah, it's Kate.
- Hey, Burn. We got a little problem.

801
01:13:45,735 --> 01:13:46,770
So, what've we got?

802
01:13:46,895 --> 01:13:51,252
Well, 50 passwords, plus whatever
Polaroid-head got inside Ellingson.

803
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:52,933
I got a lot, right?

804
01:13:53,255 --> 01:13:55,007
I don't know how many, but...

805
01:13:55,935 --> 01:13:57,004
my head hurts.

806
01:13:57,135 --> 01:13:58,568
Yo, check this out.

807
01:13:59,415 --> 01:14:00,973
- What's a da Vinci virus?
- What?

808
01:14:01,095 --> 01:14:05,691
It's a memo about how they'll deal with
the oil spills that happened on the 14th.

809
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:08,049
What oil spills?

810
01:14:10,015 --> 01:14:13,644
- Brain-dead. Today's the 1 3th.
- Well, this hasn't happened yet.

811
01:14:13,855 --> 01:14:16,415
The 14th is the day the worm ends it run.

812
01:14:19,055 --> 01:14:22,491
Isn't the da Vinci virus
what Phreak's being charged with?

813
01:14:22,615 --> 01:14:26,449
Look. 'lnfecting ballast programs
of Ellingson tankers'.

814
01:14:26,735 --> 01:14:27,804
They blame hackers!

815
01:14:27,935 --> 01:14:28,890
Damn!

816
01:14:29,175 --> 01:14:31,052
A worm and a virus?

817
01:14:31,215 --> 01:14:32,694
The plot thickens.

818
01:14:38,495 --> 01:14:40,292
Whoa, whoa! Where are you going?

819
01:14:40,415 --> 01:14:41,370
I got an idea.

820
01:14:41,975 --> 01:14:44,205
We got a few hours until we're arrested.

821
01:14:44,335 --> 01:14:47,133
Stay low. I'm going to get help.

822
01:14:47,255 --> 01:14:48,813
I'll beep you.

823
01:14:51,215 --> 01:14:52,170
Are you coming?

824
01:14:56,495 --> 01:14:58,451
May the Force be with you, man.

825
01:15:25,714 --> 01:15:27,113
There they are!

826
01:15:27,634 --> 01:15:30,910
Razor and Blade?! They're flakes!

827
01:15:31,034 --> 01:15:34,390
They're elite! Let's get 'em.

828
01:16:24,114 --> 01:16:27,186
Get off the stage, man! Get off!

829
01:16:49,834 --> 01:16:51,267
I lost them!

830
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:54,148
Where were you?

831
01:17:08,674 --> 01:17:10,392
I don't like this.

832
01:17:15,194 --> 01:17:17,389
I definitely don't like this.

833
01:17:17,634 --> 01:17:19,670
What do you want?

834
01:17:23,434 --> 01:17:25,425
We come in peace.

835
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:30,028
We need your help, if you're up to it.

836
01:17:31,234 --> 01:17:33,384
She's buff. Ballsy.

837
01:17:34,354 --> 01:17:35,389
Let's keep her.

838
01:17:35,514 --> 01:17:36,629
Waste the dude.

839
01:17:43,314 --> 01:17:47,944
A virus called da Vinci will cause
oil spills tomorrow at 10.30AM.

840
01:17:48,274 --> 01:17:50,663
It's somehow connected to that worm.

841
01:17:50,794 --> 01:17:55,470
We need you to overload the Gibson so
we can kill da Vinci and copy the worm.

842
01:17:55,994 --> 01:17:58,747
She's rabid... but cute.

843
01:17:59,194 --> 01:18:01,788
See, we're very busy.

844
01:18:01,914 --> 01:18:07,784
A TV network that wishes to remain
nameless is interested in our show.

845
01:18:08,634 --> 01:18:09,987
Let's go, Kate.

846
01:18:12,714 --> 01:18:14,033
Wait.

847
01:18:14,874 --> 01:18:16,830
Nobody said no.

848
01:18:17,354 --> 01:18:21,427
But you will need more than
just two media icons like us.

849
01:18:21,914 --> 01:18:22,869
You need an army.

850
01:18:22,994 --> 01:18:27,988
That's it. An electronic army.
If I were us,

851
01:18:28,114 --> 01:18:31,868
I'd get on the lnternet,
send out a major distress signal.

852
01:18:32,394 --> 01:18:33,827
Hackers of the world, unite!

853
01:18:34,074 --> 01:18:35,632
How will you take care of the cops?

854
01:18:55,461 --> 01:18:56,894
I'm blowing up!

855
01:18:57,021 --> 01:18:59,489
It's Kate. Grand Central.
Let's hit it!

856
01:20:05,341 --> 01:20:06,376
You're the man!

857
01:20:07,341 --> 01:20:08,251
You're the man!

858
01:20:28,181 --> 01:20:30,012
Joey, you made it!

859
01:20:34,341 --> 01:20:36,935
Okay. Use your best viruses
to buy us some time.

860
01:20:37,061 --> 01:20:38,813
We must get in and copy the worm.

861
01:20:41,261 --> 01:20:43,217
I had to do that to break the tension.

862
01:20:44,061 --> 01:20:46,655
- Cereal. Go fix the phones.
- Roger.

863
01:20:48,821 --> 01:20:50,539
Joey, take his place.

864
01:20:51,701 --> 01:20:53,532
- Me?
- Take his place. Do it.

865
01:20:53,741 --> 01:20:55,094
You can do it.

866
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:57,056
Ready?

867
01:20:58,701 --> 01:21:00,259
Let's boot up.

868
01:21:53,821 --> 01:21:57,211
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Nothing. Just a minor glitch.

869
01:21:57,341 --> 01:22:00,413
A minor glitch with you seems
to turn into a major catastrophe.

870
01:22:06,344 --> 01:22:08,255
There's a new virus in the database.

871
01:22:08,384 --> 01:22:09,578
What's happening?

872
01:22:09,704 --> 01:22:11,740
It's eating memory. What do I do?

873
01:22:11,864 --> 01:22:12,979
Type 'cookie', you idiot.

874
01:22:13,104 --> 01:22:14,935
I'll head them off at the pass.

875
01:22:19,024 --> 01:22:21,458
We have a bug attacking all log-in files.

876
01:22:21,584 --> 01:22:23,859
Run anti-virus.
Give me a systems display.

877
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,383
Die, dickweeds!

878
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:37,417
A rabbit's in the system.

879
01:22:37,544 --> 01:22:38,374
Send a flu shot.

880
01:22:38,504 --> 01:22:41,143
Rabbit? Flu shot? Someone talk to me.

881
01:22:41,264 --> 01:22:45,223
A rabbit replicates till it overloads
a file then spreads like cancer.

882
01:22:45,344 --> 01:22:46,379
Cancer?

883
01:22:47,184 --> 01:22:51,143
Row, row, row your boat

884
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,539
Gently down the stream.

885
01:22:53,664 --> 01:22:56,462
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,

886
01:22:56,584 --> 01:22:58,893
Life is but a dream.

887
01:23:00,464 --> 01:23:02,022
Whoa! Falling off!

888
01:23:02,864 --> 01:23:04,536
It's a Gibson, it's finding us too fast.

889
01:23:19,584 --> 01:23:22,303
There's too many garbage files.
I need more time.

890
01:23:28,744 --> 01:23:33,295
They're at Grand Central station,
lower level. Don't screw up.

891
01:23:33,424 --> 01:23:34,823
Get out of here!

892
01:23:34,944 --> 01:23:37,936
Everyone, let's move! Move it!

893
01:23:38,344 --> 01:23:40,096
Get the hell out of the way! Come on!

894
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:41,816
Grand Central!

895
01:23:45,944 --> 01:23:49,619
Game's over. Last chance to get out
of this without a prison sentence.

896
01:23:49,744 --> 01:23:51,018
You're not good enough to beat me.

897
01:23:51,144 --> 01:23:54,659
Maybe I'm not. But we are,

898
01:23:54,784 --> 01:23:57,139
- you asshole!
- Give it up!

899
01:23:58,184 --> 01:24:00,778
Just give it up.

900
01:24:04,424 --> 01:24:05,823
Are we fashionably late?

901
01:24:11,504 --> 01:24:12,778
Okay, let's go!

902
01:25:17,024 --> 01:25:20,300
We have massive infection.
Multiple GPI viruses...

903
01:25:20,424 --> 01:25:21,618
..from remote nodes.

904
01:25:21,744 --> 01:25:24,133
- They're going for the kernel.
- Colonel who?

905
01:25:24,264 --> 01:25:26,220
The command processor. The brain!

906
01:25:26,344 --> 01:25:28,335
Cancer, brain. Brain cancer!

907
01:25:28,984 --> 01:25:30,053
What's going on?

908
01:25:30,184 --> 01:25:32,459
In short, Duke, a shitstorm.

909
01:25:34,424 --> 01:25:36,221
Move! Go!

910
01:26:15,704 --> 01:26:17,217
I found it!

911
01:26:17,904 --> 01:26:19,132
I found it!

912
01:26:42,704 --> 01:26:45,059
This is the end, my friend.

913
01:26:46,664 --> 01:26:47,892
Thank you for calling.

914
01:26:51,344 --> 01:26:52,333
Shit!

915
01:26:52,504 --> 01:26:53,732
He got me!

916
01:26:54,384 --> 01:26:55,578
Joey's gettin' stupid busy.

917
01:26:57,024 --> 01:27:00,380
Joey, go after the worm.
You're the closest.

918
01:27:01,824 --> 01:27:05,180
It's root, slash, period, 'workspace',

919
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:07,943
slash, period, 'garbage', period.

920
01:27:11,064 --> 01:27:12,577
Out of the way!

921
01:27:15,864 --> 01:27:18,059
Out of the way! Freeze!

922
01:27:21,904 --> 01:27:22,461
Come on!

923
01:27:47,507 --> 01:27:48,178
All right! Wow!

924
01:27:49,987 --> 01:27:51,022
Kill the Gibson!

925
01:27:51,147 --> 01:27:52,102
Roger that.

926
01:27:57,827 --> 01:28:00,660
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Is that all you got?

927
01:28:01,227 --> 01:28:03,536
Come on! Let's see what else you can do.

928
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:08,377
You talking to me, huh?
Are you nuts? Come at me!

929
01:28:11,947 --> 01:28:13,665
They're in the kernel.

930
01:28:13,787 --> 01:28:14,936
Help me!

931
01:28:17,507 --> 01:28:20,305
The tankers have stopped capsizing.

932
01:28:20,427 --> 01:28:22,099
Ballast tanks emptying.

933
01:28:22,227 --> 01:28:23,626
Should be okay.

934
01:28:36,267 --> 01:28:37,985
Little pissant!

935
01:28:49,838 --> 01:28:50,793
Yes!

936
01:28:52,998 --> 01:28:54,477
Let's get outta here!

937
01:28:54,598 --> 01:28:55,314
Freeze!

938
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:16,708
They're trashing our rights, man.

939
01:29:16,838 --> 01:29:19,750
They're trashing the flow of data.

940
01:29:19,878 --> 01:29:21,027
Trashing!

941
01:29:21,278 --> 01:29:22,313
Trashing!

942
01:29:22,598 --> 01:29:23,553
Trashing!

943
01:29:24,438 --> 01:29:26,110
Hack the planet!

944
01:29:26,358 --> 01:29:28,189
- Hack the planet!
- Shut up and get in!

945
01:29:28,318 --> 01:29:30,036
Hack the planet!

946
01:29:30,278 --> 01:29:31,552
Hack the planet!

947
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:41,108
- Hello.
- We caught them.

948
01:29:41,238 --> 01:29:43,035
- Good.
- Red-handed.

949
01:29:43,958 --> 01:29:46,074
You won't be having
any more trouble from them.

950
01:29:58,918 --> 01:30:03,389
Me, all right? I did it.
She knows shit about computers.

951
01:30:04,998 --> 01:30:06,636
She's just my girlfriend.

952
01:30:09,358 --> 01:30:11,713
I suggest you modify your attitude,

953
01:30:11,838 --> 01:30:13,476
because you are floating

954
01:30:13,598 --> 01:30:15,350
and I am about to flush your ass.

955
01:30:16,918 --> 01:30:19,955
Mrs Murphy is here to see you, sir.

956
01:30:26,958 --> 01:30:29,791
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- Trying to help you.

957
01:30:36,038 --> 01:30:37,676
- Dade.
- What?

958
01:30:38,998 --> 01:30:40,033
Thanks for your help.

959
01:30:46,278 --> 01:30:48,348
Your son is in big trouble.

960
01:30:48,638 --> 01:30:52,836
He violated his probation and
has engaged in criminal activities.

961
01:30:53,678 --> 01:30:55,794
My son happens to be a genius.

962
01:30:55,918 --> 01:30:59,877
He understands things that you won't
comprehend if you live to be 100.

963
01:30:59,998 --> 01:31:02,512
He would never use his knowledge
to harm others.

964
01:31:02,638 --> 01:31:04,594
The news crew you requested is here.

965
01:31:04,718 --> 01:31:06,754
Good. I have some things to tell them.

966
01:31:06,998 --> 01:31:10,707
Your son is facing 30 felony counts
in an ongoing investigation.

967
01:31:10,838 --> 01:31:13,113
You face arrest if you do that.

968
01:31:13,238 --> 01:31:14,956
I don't care if I face certain death.

969
01:31:15,078 --> 01:31:17,672
Mrs Murphy stays right here.

970
01:31:19,638 --> 01:31:21,469
Wow. She's great.

971
01:31:22,878 --> 01:31:23,549
Yeah.

972
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:27,230
..and attacked the Ellingson network.

973
01:31:27,361 --> 01:31:30,319
Is this the last we've seen
of this kind ofespionage?

974
01:31:31,441 --> 01:31:34,399
No. Hackers are a grave threat
to the national security.

975
01:31:34,521 --> 01:31:37,354
This incident just proves
that we need

976
01:31:37,481 --> 01:31:39,949
- increased funding to stop...
- We're getting interference.

977
01:31:40,081 --> 01:31:42,276
Hola, boys and girls.
It is l, Cereal Killer,

978
01:31:42,401 --> 01:31:47,350
making my first worldwide
global television appearance.

979
01:31:47,921 --> 01:31:50,071
Yes, that's right.

980
01:31:50,201 --> 01:31:53,591
I'm here to tell you about this heinous
scheme hatched within Ellingson Mineral.

981
01:31:54,601 --> 01:31:55,431
But for what?

982
01:31:55,561 --> 01:31:58,029
World domination? Nay.

983
01:31:58,161 --> 01:32:01,312
Something far more tacky.

984
01:32:01,761 --> 01:32:07,279
A virus called da Vinci, that would cause
Ellingson tankers to capsize,

985
01:32:07,401 --> 01:32:11,917
was to be blamed on innocent hackers.
This virus was really a smokescreen.

986
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:18,594
What could be so important to protect
that someone would create such a nasty,

987
01:32:18,721 --> 01:32:21,440
anti-social, uncool virus program?

988
01:32:21,561 --> 01:32:22,630
But why?

989
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:25,555
Could it be to cover the tracks
of this worm program?

990
01:32:25,681 --> 01:32:28,639
A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks.

991
01:32:28,881 --> 01:32:31,679
The password for this worm
belongs to Margo Wallace,

992
01:32:31,801 --> 01:32:34,713
- head ofPublic Relations at Ellingson.
- Oh, my God!

993
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:36,672
And Eugene Belford,

994
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:40,157
- computer security officer.
- Son of a bitch!

995
01:32:40,801 --> 01:32:45,477
What's this? The account in the Bahamas
where the money was to be stashed?

996
01:32:45,601 --> 01:32:46,636
I think so.

997
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:48,433
Unlucky!

998
01:32:50,241 --> 01:32:51,356
Yo.

999
01:32:51,481 --> 01:32:53,278
I kinda feel like God.

1000
01:32:58,281 --> 01:32:59,555
Plague?

1001
01:33:01,961 --> 01:33:02,950
Eugene?

1002
01:33:12,921 --> 01:33:18,393
I don't even know how to work the VCR
let alone a computer. Get off!

1003
01:33:18,521 --> 01:33:24,118
Listen, I'll make a deal. Eugene Belford.
I know where his mother is.

1004
01:33:24,241 --> 01:33:26,596
Get off me! I need a lawyer!

1005
01:33:36,761 --> 01:33:38,638
Here you are, Mr Babbage.

1006
01:33:38,761 --> 01:33:42,674
Flight time to Tokyo is 14 hours.
Can I get you anything else?

1007
01:33:42,801 --> 01:33:45,110
Just a pillow, please.

1008
01:33:51,161 --> 01:33:52,230
Thank you.

1009
01:33:54,561 --> 01:33:56,313
You're welcome.

1010
01:33:56,441 --> 01:33:59,035
What's going on? Let go of me!
Stewardess!

1011
01:33:59,161 --> 01:34:01,755
I'll never fly this airline again!

1012
01:34:11,876 --> 01:34:13,946
You look good in a dress.

1013
01:34:14,956 --> 01:34:16,787
You would have looked better.

1014
01:34:23,236 --> 01:34:25,033
Wanna go for a swim?

1015
01:34:35,316 --> 01:34:38,194
I can't believe they decided you won.

1016
01:34:39,156 --> 01:34:43,388
They didn't. The guys felt it was
the only way I'd get a date.

1017
01:34:46,436 --> 01:34:47,585
Anyway,

1018
01:34:49,276 --> 01:34:50,914
you're pretty good.

1019
01:34:51,276 --> 01:34:52,675
You're elite.

1020
01:34:54,356 --> 01:34:55,505
Yeah?

1021
01:34:55,996 --> 01:35:00,512
If you'd said that at the start,
you would have avoided a lot of trouble.

1022
01:35:12,116 --> 01:35:13,549
Beat that!

1023
01:35:26,556 --> 01:35:27,750
You know,

1024
01:35:29,596 --> 01:35:33,384
- I've been having these weird...
- ..dreams.
