00:00:23,326 --> 00:00:27,185
The following is inspired
by real events.

4
00:00:33,113 --> 00:00:35,230
Every movement starts with a spark.

5
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:38,433
A flame, something
to ignite the status quo.

6
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:40,183
incite the troops.

7
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:44,853
Lenny Bruce, and Abby Hoffman,
right?

8
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:57,607
But we're getting ahead of ourselves.
Two weeks ago,

9
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,349
We were more concerned
about the talent show, than making bail.

10
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:09,268
Freedom.

11
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:11,482
Aint free.
And... clap clap clap.

12
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:13,506
Thank you very much Rolanda.
Emily,

13
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,529
who is next?
Let me go find out.

14
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,148
No!

15
00:01:20,172 --> 00:01:20,980
You are not!

16
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:22,880
You are not the director.

17
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,360
My little sister is coming. She doesn't need to see your little Hebrew national bouncing across the stage.

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,120
Art, is not meant to be safe.

19
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,420
So you want to censor me now?
Huh?! Where does it stop?

20
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,020
Who don't you censor?

21
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,160
The guy not wearing a thong.

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,300
Mr. Ritzer,

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,940
I'm sure that wearing boxer shorts, won't do
too much damage to your artistic piece.

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,000
Wake me up before you go go.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
A musical tribute to the rise and fall of WAM.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,860
I very much look foward to it.

27
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,240
In a different costume.

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,240
Emily, who is next?

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,120
You, I actually don't think
it all together suck.

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,120
But then again, it is a talent show
trying to find talent at Booker High School.

31
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,580
It's like trying to find weapons of
mass destruction in my anus.

32
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,780
We're on our way to the top,
we can't be stopped.

33
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,000
This cheer, sucks.

34
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,000
We need to do something edgier.

35
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,000
So we like, freak out
the other team.

36
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,100
OK, um...
Like what?

37
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,760
No problem,
I did this last night.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,240
A two, a three, a four.

39
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,020
Punch him in his nuts!

40
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,600
Kick him in his hole!

41
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,400
Shove him up a ten foot pole.

42
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,760
Goooo,
defense!

43
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,860
In the history of cheerleading,

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,840
That was so hot.

45
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,980
Officer Weller won't expel us for that one.

46
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,060
Hi.

47
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,480
Good morning everybody, hey!
I just thought I'd drop in, say hello.

48
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,300
Hi ladies, how are ya?

49
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,500
Wow! Uogh.

50
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,320
Event committee, you know.

51
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,180
I'll tell you a little secret. Once uh,

52
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,640
I used to be on an event committee myself.
And I know,

53
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,300
The grunt work that you guys do,
it's really

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,180
But I tell you,
it's the grunt work, that is gonna make this the best

55
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,180
Holiday hoopla ever!

56
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,180
Alright, holiday hoopla!

57
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,580
For those of you, who have been doing grunt work,
on my campaign for state school superintendent.

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,320
Thank you so much!

59
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,080
And for those of you
who haven't, there's still time.

60
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,420
Great,
great.

61
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,800
Hoopla.

62
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,360
It's great.
Ben, get your tits moving, let's go.

63
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,380
Ready? OK!
For firing up, we're sisters.

64
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,560
We're turning up the heat!

65
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,320
When it comes to football,
we can't be beat!

66
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,320
How did I get down here?

67
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,840
Mrs. Rose.

68
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,340
What are you wearing?
Well, it's ferret week.

69
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,920
The big football game, there's lots of parties.
And we can't be blind to how

70
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,580
teenagers sometimes behave at parties...

71
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,920
Are you retarded?

72
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,420
Really, are you a retard?

73
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,920
You're not gonna walk around my
high school, promoting sex!

74
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,720
Oh, well principal Weller,
I don't believe in premarital sex.

75
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,720
But I do think that,

76
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,540
We should be realistic about teenagers today---

77
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,180
We're not gonna give them a free pass
by walking around and handing out

78
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,340
condoms! It is offensive, disgusting, and obscene!

79
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,440
But, I think we're on the same side---
Canon!

80
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,920
You're suspended,
10 days. Get out!

81
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,100
I said get out!
Jesus.

82
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,140
Oh, god.
What do these, latex.

83
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,320
Natural! Sweets,
keeper.

84
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,560
So, directors.

85
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,560
How was your first assignment?

86
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,840
Uhhh, let me guess.

87
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,680
They didn't quite turn out as well as
they were in your imagination, did they?

88
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,560
Well, then.
You were her success!

89
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,480
Shall we watch some film?

90
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,060
Lawrence?

91
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,480
Wake me up before you go go,

92
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,960
Is the true story,
behind the rise and fall of WANG.

93
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,720
It's a little bit dream girls, and a little bit
of chorus line, but most importantly, it's a little bit

94
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,460
you and me.

95
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,460
Yeah Lawrence, we have rules.

96
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,500
Martin Luther King Boulevard.

97
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,380
Malcolm X, Boulevard.

98
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,060
Jessie Jackson, Boulevard.

99
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,700
What about Clatonia Joaquin Dorticus boulevard?

100
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,580
Inventor of a device, for applying color

101
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,740
to the side of your shoes.

102
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,340
Where is her boulevard?

103
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,020
Where are all, the unsung African
American boulevards?

104
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,420
Well I, Walanda Jenkins,

105
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,900
Say no black person left behind.

106
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,020
You tell her sister.

107
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,120
Ooh, Walanda,
let me borrow that afro for Halloween.

108
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,080
Hello, everybody today.

109
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,040
I glad you watch my video today.

110
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,740
I like to be America.

111
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,720
And happy happy, me.

112
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,740
Please!

113
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,780
That's how I'm still viewed by much of this country,
but I am this country.

114
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,620
My parents, are
third generation Americans.

115
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,440
Never mind, Walanda.
I wanna borrow that kimono for Halloween---
Mm hmm, that's right girl!

116
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,840
Where were you,
May 2nd 1985?

117
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,220
Well,

118
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,040
I wasn't alive yet,

119
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,220
But Bradley Betts was.

120
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,760
That night, he blew chow all over Patty Ivin's
silk taffeta dress.

121
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,760
Complete and utter facial diarrhea.

122
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,380
And, how do I know this?

123
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,620
The making, of the prom video.

124
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,640
I propose, we stay with
tradition, and make another.

125
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,540
Making of the prom video,
as the AV Club has done for nearly two decades.

126
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,720
That's why I'm here.

127
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,720
The carry the torch.

128
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,880
Drats! These outfits.

129
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,880
Why does Halloween only come once a year?

130
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,360
My movie, is called "Paint".

131
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,800
Which will be an hour and a half
of me watching paint.

132
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,800
Dry.

133
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,820
OK, just kidding.

134
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,700
Truth is, I haven't found a subject
that I found was important enough, yet. But,

135
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,900
I will.

136
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,460
Did you ever play paintball?

137
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,920
My film is an in-depth look
at clitoral mutilation.

138
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,200
That's draws parallels,
to the Bush-era policies towards women.

139
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,420
Chick flick! Shut up Chuck.

140
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,360
Yeah, give me an 'A', give me an 'S',
give me another 'S'.

141
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,140
Oh, yeah baby.
Look at them blue undies.

142
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
There you are,
shake that hiney for me.

143
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,560
Oh, yeah.
Shake that hiney.

144
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,300
There you are, Oh!

145
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,780
Excellent, excellent, excellent work!

146
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,780
Really, really.

147
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,380
Even Chucky here his statement about
the voyeuristic aspects of our society.

148
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,380
That's exactly what I was trying to accomplish.

149
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,920
You and me meet again after school...

150
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,940
OK, guys. Listen, listen.
Film making is a collaborative medium.

151
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,480
That means, collectively you're gonna have to
find something that speaks to all of you equally.

152
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh, can we... collectively
chose one of our own projects?

153
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,440
I thought that Charles' idea was pretty groundbreaking.

154
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,440
I agree.

155
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,840
And it also takes place
in another country.

156
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,560
It's a dissection of a people,
in a culture that is

157
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,400
both literally and figuratively,
millions

158
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
of miles away from us.

159
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,680
But right here, in your school, in this school
this morning, I young woman was suspended for wearing a dress,

160
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,080
that's covered in condoms
to promote safe sex. Monica Rose.

161
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,080
I hate her, she's a size 1.

162
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,800
Another woman, was suspended today,

163
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,100
Because your principal,

164
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,620
Confiscated her diary,

165
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,280
because it contains,
some violent poetry.

166
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,000
That's a violation of privacy.

167
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,100
I agree,
so the question remains.

168
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,560
What story do you want
to tell, as a group?

169
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,700
So, what's the next assignment?

170
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,700
That's simple.

171
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,060
Most revolutions start innocently enough.

172
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,840
Taking a seat on a bus,
throwing a tea party.

173
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,180
I class assignment.

174
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,180
Where are you going?

175
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,380
To change the world.
Really?

176
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,700
Do you want help? Because I changed the world last Tuesday.
I might be able to give you some tips or something?

177
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,100
OK, uh, how about a ride home?
I just parked over there.

178
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,720
You like my film idea?

179
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,720
Yeah. I mean, it was heavy stuff, but---

180
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,520
Clitoral Mutilation.

181
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
Right! Yeah, it's hard to believe that
we live in the same world that

182
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,000
stuff like that, actually happens.

183
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,460
Hey!

184
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,160
Is it true you had a threesome with Christina Stephenson
and Kim Paige?

185
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,240
Well, who started that rumor?

186
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,620
'Cause I don't want you taking me home
and then tomorrow find out that I had like

187
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,660
An orgy with a bunch of midgets or something.
Well, if you do hear that, it won't be from me.

188
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
It's little people.

189
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,220
You can take me home.

190
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,280
I--- I've never been on a bike before!

191
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,080
Is it new?

192
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,080
Yeah! Looks like it.

193
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,740
Why don't you drop me off a block away.

194
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,740
My Mom would kill
me if she saw me on a bike.

195
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,180
Well, then.
It's a good thing I don't own a bike.

196
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,140
OK, I'm a dork.
Yeah, you are. Yeah.

197
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,080
Just thought you wouldn't find out so soon.

198
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,740
We are so there.

199
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,280
Well, traditionally, the minority student's union
has been

200
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,920
predominantly African American. Hey!

201
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,220
Mr. D encouraged us to make a change,
you know? Maybe we could all work together or something.

202
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,020
Well, traditionally, the club---
Tradition can kiss my fat Chinese ass.

203
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,280
Well, what about Chuck?
He's just a weird looking white boy.

204
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,400
Um, excuse me Walanda. I don't know
if you noticed, but I'm a bit on the heavy side.

205
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,740
Although more and more
Americans are struggling with their weight,

206
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,960
We're still, a very frowned upon minority.

207
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,960
And he dresses like he's blind.

208
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
He's a double WAMY.

209
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,500
Oh, aren't you gonna
ask why I'm eligible?

210
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,260
Boy, please. You're so gay,
Shear dresses up like you.

211
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,700
Alright, you guys are in.

212
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,660
Cool!
We are the cougars.

213
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,900
The blue, and the gold. Nice work ladies, good.
We're on our way,

214
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,180
to the top, we can't be stopped.

215
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,980
Come on down, shush up,
help me!

216
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,820
H, S, one more:
B. H, S

217
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,220
The best!

218
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,480
Yeah, alright!
I think we're ready for our big game.

219
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,960
Now we know what we
want to wear to cheer camp, and it wasn't

220
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,280
dressed like a Kelly deflowered.

221
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,420
Hey, isn't this your house?

222
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,520
Mm hmm.
Are you... gonna get out?

223
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,260
I was just waiting to see something.

224
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,480
Wait, to see what?

225
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,780
If your reputation is deserved.

226
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,740
See ya in class.

227
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,580
Are you sure you want to wear
your hair like this to the talent show, baby?

228
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,880
Why not? Well, you kind of look
like Burney from room 222.

229
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,540
A fine black man.

230
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,920
Hear that? Wohh, wore his hair natural just like this.
In my day, we all wore our hair like this.

231
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,380
That's how it should me, natural.

232
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,540
Not like all those fake weebs,
trying to look like we're on friends, or something.

233
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,940
Oh, my god! Monica
your hair is looking so good!

234
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,820
Thanks Phoebs, yours too.
It's so straight and blonde.

235
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,600
Please.

236
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,420
Well, you know something? Sister Maya would be proud. right on.
I know she would.

237
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,920
Oh,

238
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,740
Guess what I went shopping for today?

239
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,320
What?

240
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,800
You're supposed to guess,
that's why I said: "Guess".

241
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,480
So guess.

242
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,480
Katie, you can play this game too.

243
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,880
I don't know.
What?

244
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,980
New pair of: "Who Haz".

245
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,300
Sergeant, please
don't do that at the table.

246
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,760
It's improper.

247
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,420
Lawn jockeys.

248
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,660
What this house needs,
is a really good lawn jockeys.

249
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,400
Come on kid,
let's go!

250
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,013
Enough exploding zombies.
It's family game night, and you know what that means.

251
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,600
Yahtzee?

252
00:14:29,093 --> 00:14:30,360
Come on, sweetie.

253
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:31,760
You better get amped up.

254
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:33,253
You gotta put some heart into it.

255
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,813
Yahtzee, Yahtzee!

256
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, yeah, Yahtzee!!

257
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,253
Come on, let's go.

258
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,250
Alright, just uh.
Wait 'till I'm done this game.

259
00:14:42,386 --> 00:14:43,480
No, I

260
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,466
What happened to that little boy?

261
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:51,053
That little boy used to love his Daddy.

262
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,493
He used to love to play games with his Daddy.

263
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:56,986
Alright. Where should she going---
Dad.

264
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,546
Alright, I'd still do it,
but just the save game.

265
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:06,346
Computers are good for two things kid.

266
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:08,666
Internet porn,

267
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,093
And um,

268
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:13,090
Well, internet porn.
Phh.

269
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,626
So, come on.

270
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,880
Don't make me kiss you again.
Alright.

271
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
Yahtzee.

272
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,160
OK, what do you mean, your stupid
AV club isn't doing a making of the prom video?

273
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,573
I have zero tolerance for that.

274
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:33,466
Well, what am Ii supposed to do?
They do it every year, but---

275
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,346
Mr. D. wants something more, I, I don't know:
Like, socially concious or something.

276
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,040
Ah, no no no no no no no.

277
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
I have zero tolerance for that.

278
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,813
You promised us all, right Ashley?

279
00:15:42,813 --> 00:15:44,346
Yeah, you did Katy,
you did.

280
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,386
And I'm with Katy,
I have zero tolerance for that. Ladies?

281
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:52,720
Uniforms! If the shirts
would get any shorter they would be headbands.

282
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,653
So, unless you want me changing your
uniforms to HazMat suits, I would suggest,

283
00:15:57,786 --> 00:15:59,960
covering the thighs, hm?

284
00:16:02,946 --> 00:16:05,040
Ashley, my office.
Now.

285
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:08,626
Cheerleading probation.
Hmm, big deal...

286
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,546
Yeah, Ashley.
Screw officer Weller.

287
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,493
I once got fired from my job
as a CIT at summer camp,

288
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,026
For getting caught while
my boyfriend was sliding-in the third.

289
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,293
Spot on, Kelly.

290
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:20,693
Big deal, Ashley.
I mean, consider yourself lucky.

291
00:16:21,493 --> 00:16:22,280
Hey

292
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:23,880
Isn't that Monica's locker?

293
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:25,880
It was her locker.

294
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:28,640
She was suspended for
pinning condoms to her dress.

295
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:30,960
Monica is coming back
though, isn't she?

296
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,520
Principal Weller won't allow
her to attend classes without an apology.

297
00:16:34,586 --> 00:16:36,733
What, is she not
gonna apologize?

298
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,573
Monica is the founder of this school's
celibacy society.

299
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,453
She didn't pass out condoms to incite
a school-wide orgy. She cares about people!

300
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:46,450
She shouldn't have to apologize for that.

301
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,773
Would you adopt me?

302
00:16:47,933 --> 00:16:51,253
Uh, Mam, Could I interview you for
the school newspaper? Um.

303
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,480
And did you say you were
Monica's... Mother?

304
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,560
Really? Her, her her... Mother?

305
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,973
I, I mean: sister I could
understand, but Mother?

306
00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:02,853
Very good, young man.

307
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,026
Sure.

308
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:06,160
I'll do your interview.

309
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Look, if you want to get published,

310
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:10,160
Find another story.

311
00:17:10,506 --> 00:17:13,186
How about the
history of the Pom-pom?

312
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,180
That was my idea.

313
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:18,600
Mr. Mumsford.
3 girls in our senior class are pregnant.

314
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,960
Yet, our school doesn't pass
out condoms.

315
00:17:21,386 --> 00:17:23,320
Charlett, I want

316
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,866
the paper, to be
supportive of principal Weller!

317
00:17:27,306 --> 00:17:28,840
Besides, Matt is already...

318
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,320
working on a story about
the talent show, and---

319
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,013
Holiday hoopla.

320
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:36,010
Are you kidding me?

321
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:40,693
You stood up
for what you believe in.

322
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,690
And that's what counts.
Thanks, Mom.

323
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:44,200
Tofu.

324
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:48,386
He is...
suck a jerk.

325
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,560
And the newspaper is just a joke.
And the sucky thing is, we can't do anything about it.

326
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,666
Well, I wouldn't say that.
You just have to be... More creative.

327
00:17:56,786 --> 00:17:58,866
Like how?
Well...

328
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,733
I protest against fur by staging
a naked demonstration in central park.

329
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:06,240
Like I said,
there's nothing we can do about it.

330
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:07,320
Look,

331
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:09,880
If you need me to drop trial
for the cause, just let me know.

332
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:18,306
Tim spears? Two words.
"Dance", "Belt".

333
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:19,986
Thank you.
Ahh

334
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:21,980
Hold in, my boy.
One word.

335
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:23,453
Accent.

336
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,026
When performing Shakespeare,

337
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:28,706
Once must always use,
the Queen's English.

338
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:31,706
"To be, or not to be."

339
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,173
Riddle be that,

340
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,293
You can hear me so much more
the merrier, when I used an accent.

341
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:38,506
Yes?

342
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,370
Elo ho ho my lord.

343
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:43,040
Smashing, good show.

344
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:46,813
I'm so sick of this school.

345
00:18:46,986 --> 00:18:49,133
I hear you,
no one listens to us.

346
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,720
Well, what are you
gonna do about it?

347
00:18:50,906 --> 00:18:53,493
This administration is
one long skidmark.

348
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,680
Lovely, Emily.

349
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:57,013
What?

350
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,960
I'm not the one wearing
a home-made banana hammock.

351
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,413
You asked what we're gonna do about it?

352
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,573
Get creative.

353
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:10,733
What are you thinking?

354
00:19:11,226 --> 00:19:13,666
I think she's writing
an editorial for tonight's performance.

355
00:19:13,973 --> 00:19:15,093
Ladies and gentlemen,

356
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:18,213
Welcome to Holiday Hoopla,
Booker High!

357
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:20,210
Take it away!

358
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:28,293
4 minutes, 8.5 seconds.
A new breath holding record.

359
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:28,306
Stella!
4 minutes, 8.5 seconds.
A new breath holding record.

360
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:29,880
Stella!

361
00:19:30,146 --> 00:19:32,493
Stella!!

362
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:37,400
It's just a game between two lost souls.

363
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,800
Still I love him to fill my soul.

364
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:44,280
That's why he's here,
I don't know his name.

365
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,933
But we play,

366
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,786
The singing.

367
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:57,800
Thus began the dance, of cock sure love!

368
00:19:58,026 --> 00:20:05,840
Love!

369
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,000
Good luck.

370
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:17,000
You're gonna need it to beat that number.

371
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,706
Our performer is:

372
00:20:19,706 --> 00:20:21,493
The performance will be
a little piece from "Hamlet".

373
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,746
By master William Shakespeare.

374
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,040
To be,

375
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,706
Or not to be.

376
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:32,906
That is the question.

377
00:20:40,693 --> 00:20:41,533
No,

378
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:44,306
No, no.
That isn't the question.

379
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:45,760
The question,

380
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Is rather two questions,

381
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,626
Whether to pick up arms,

382
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:52,360
against a sea of adults,
who urge you to close your eyes,

383
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,066
and trust us.

384
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,426
Last year,

385
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:00,186
The government sent out

386
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,920
117 million

387
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,280
dollars, to schools who promised
not to teach safe sex, and promote

388
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,146
abstinence only.

389
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:10,040
I hope you like the new
football field,

390
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,706
Would you like to know what it cost?
It cost the sexual education of your children, it caused

391
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,666
2 student abortions. Because
this school would rather buy a new jumbotron,

392
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,660
Than hand out a condom.

393
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,453
To die.

394
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:25,450
To sleep.

395
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:26,920
To sleep.

396
00:21:27,026 --> 00:21:29,120
While a girl, is suspended from school,

397
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,400
for writing down her thoughts.

398
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,666
Creativity, cut off at the neck.
To sleep!

399
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,960
While our very own,
Principal Weller,

400
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,573
Wins an election, and
becomes state superintendent.

401
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:40,346
So she can force her medieval policies,

402
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,693
On the rest of this state's students.
That's enough.

403
00:21:42,786 --> 00:21:44,840
That, is, enough.
Mr.--- wake up!

404
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,360
Stop, right now.

405
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,560
Emily, lights! lights!
Don't vote Weller.

406
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:50,933
Stop this now!

407
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,386
I chose not to be.

408
00:21:59,413 --> 00:22:02,546
Oh my God! Call 911!
Oh, my God.

409
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:05,960
Do something!

410
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,093
Oh, oh jeez.

411
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:13,906
Awesome.

412
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:15,266
Hold it!

413
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,320
Yeah, hold it.

414
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:20,733
Totally awesome.

415
00:22:23,026 --> 00:22:25,586
Oh, he's so dark.
He's so mysterious.

416
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:27,293
Who cares?

417
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,290
Walanda didn't even get to perform.

418
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:31,290
Was there a lot of blood?

419
00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:33,290
Seriously, a lot?

420
00:22:33,706 --> 00:22:35,290
Like, a Pint?

421
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:37,653
So terrible.

422
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:39,920
Mother.

423
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,920
Holden was trying
to make a point.

424
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,640
He was trying to incite an otherwise
apathetic student body.

425
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,640
Why bother?

426
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,506
I could have walked away
with that trophy.

427
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,706
You still can.

428
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:55,640
That was not comedy.

429
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:59,146
I know comedy, and that was not comedy.
I wasn't trying to be funny.

430
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,413
I was trying to say something.

431
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,640
You spoke to me Holden.
Me too.

432
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,680
I man, I liked when you slit your wrist,
and whoosh!

433
00:23:04,773 --> 00:23:07,786
Blowing over the stage, and crap like that.
It rock! Thank you.

434
00:23:08,426 --> 00:23:10,546
So much Mr. Stratton, but I'll be taking it

435
00:23:10,546 --> 00:23:12,540
from here. And I must say,

436
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:15,466
that with the exception of a surprise
visit from Mr. Andy

437
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,786
Couffman,

438
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,386
it was your best effort to date.

439
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,480
Well, thank you, Principal Weller.
I felt so good about--- thank you so much.

440
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,506
Mr. Stratton.

441
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:28,133
As for you, Holden Donovan.

442
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,400
I'll see you in my office
tomorrow morning first thing.

443
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:34,400
Oh,

444
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:37,973
Good news.
You don't have to waste your time doing homework.

445
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:47,600
Nor will this institution ever allow
such actions on school grounds.

446
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:52,133
Be it on the athletic field, in a classroom,
or during any creative performance.

447
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,066
Immediate, and disciplinary action will be taken by
the school authority.

448
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,800
As a result of any infraction to this rule.

449
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,266
OK. I think it's all pretty clear.

450
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:03,613
No fake killing yourself in the big game.

451
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,546
Ever if it's under 2 minutes, we're down 3
and we got no time outs?

452
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,080
Garcia, if we're down 3 with no time outs,
you better really kill yourself, hombre.

453
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,040
In a classroom or during any
creative performance.

454
00:24:17,173 --> 00:24:23,973
Immediate and strict disciplinary action will be taken by the school authority as a result of any infraction to this rule.

455
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,600
Mrs. Jordan, I just wanted to say
that if it looks like I fall down dead,

456
00:24:27,853 --> 00:24:30,040
It's probably just low blood sugar.

457
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,813
We're on a low-carb diet.
It could happen.

458
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:36,120
So guys, immediate and strict

459
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:38,920
disciplinary action will be
taken by the school authority

460
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:41,893
as a result of any infraction to this rule.

461
00:24:42,853 --> 00:24:43,890
What do you all think about that?

462
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,120
I don't know, it's the rule?

463
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,120
Yes, it's "the rule".

464
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:51,133
But so is 'i' before 'e' except after 'c'.

465
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:55,266
That's the rule too, but that doesn't stop
you clowns from ignoring it half the time.

466
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:58,226
What do you think about the rule?

467
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,613
Um,

468
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,613
It goes against our first amendment rights?
Oh, what?

469
00:25:03,906 --> 00:25:04,906
What?

470
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:07,600
You speak heresy, young lady?

471
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:11,840
Yes, sure. There are gross,

472
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,506
transgressions against the constitution here.

473
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,240
But, this is English class, so.

474
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:20,426
We'll focal purely
on the grammatical dissection

475
00:25:21,226 --> 00:25:22,420
of the piece.

476
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,320
Anybody?

477
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:28,560
Uh, you can't modify a noun with a noun.

478
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:29,960
That's very good, Charles.

479
00:25:30,146 --> 00:25:32,946
Good catch, but that is
the least of this thing's problems.

480
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,940
Anyone else?

481
00:25:35,546 --> 00:25:39,013
A lot of people worked very hard
on this show and it was ruined.

482
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:43,480
Demolished, like a wrecking ball,
in the side of The Belasco Theater.

483
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:47,160
A lot of you, say you want
to be professional actors and actresses.

484
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,960
Well, I've been around, hmm?

485
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:50,960
I know a thing or two about that!

486
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:53,733
I have Harvey Fierstein's autograph.

487
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:58,213
Would Harvey Fierstein have slit
his gay wrist?

488
00:25:58,826 --> 00:26:00,426
No! He wouldn't.

489
00:26:02,106 --> 00:26:02,866
I know

490
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:04,860
I have his autograph.

491
00:26:11,173 --> 00:26:12,560
I get it.

492
00:26:12,973 --> 00:26:14,466
I do.

493
00:26:15,013 --> 00:26:16,506
You're the dark boy.

494
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:18,426
You were the one,

495
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:21,880
that all the impressionable, young girls
fall for.

496
00:26:23,746 --> 00:26:26,973
And, to be perfectly honest, in my impressionable
young girl days,

497
00:26:26,973 --> 00:26:28,970
I might have fallen for you too.

498
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,080
But we grow up.

499
00:26:33,986 --> 00:26:36,000
We learn about real life.

500
00:26:36,693 --> 00:26:37,880
Holden,

501
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,053
I love,

502
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:41,480
and value education. I do.

503
00:26:41,986 --> 00:26:47,253
And what you did last night was a horrific display
of egotistical self-indulgence that had an extremely

504
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,080
Negative effect on the student body.

505
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,880
Actually, the students seemed to like it.

506
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:53,893
The only people put off,
were the adults.

507
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,240
I respectfully agree to disagree.

508
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,386
And seeing, as you broke several

509
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,293
codes of conduct,

510
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:04,040
It's within my authority to suspend you
for such a reckless act.

511
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,640
What I did wasn't reckless.

512
00:27:05,813 --> 00:27:06,533
Hmm.

513
00:27:06,613 --> 00:27:09,053
If you really love, and care about education,

514
00:27:09,173 --> 00:27:10,746
take a look around this school.

515
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:13,213
In room 218, we have an anatomy teacher

516
00:27:13,293 --> 00:27:16,186
who lives with his Mom,
has never seen a naked body, including his own.

517
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,346
In room 324, we have a European history teacher
with sweaty armpit stains.

518
00:27:20,493 --> 00:27:22,560
Who has never stepped foot
outside of this city.

519
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:23,666
What's your point.

520
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,053
My point, is that the side effect of
education should not be death,

521
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,050
by boredom and mediocrity.

522
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:30,733
You're nothing but a politician.

523
00:27:31,426 --> 00:27:33,053
Holden---

524
00:27:33,973 --> 00:27:34,666
Yes?

525
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,853
Forget the suspension.

526
00:27:41,053 --> 00:27:42,850
You're expelled.

527
00:27:43,786 --> 00:27:46,040
Oh, Holden. One more thing.

528
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,666
Don't think I don't know where these ideas came
from. Children don't just act like this in a vacuum.

529
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,893
Good luck with this.

530
00:28:02,493 --> 00:28:03,400
Socks!

531
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:07,866
I can't believe she expelled somebody,
for the best acting performance, since
the original "Dawn Of The Dead".

532
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,860
Holden, I feel like it's my fault.

533
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,860
Are you kidding me,
I performed it.

534
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:13,986
It's as much my fault
as it is anybody else's.

535
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,626
Wait wait, this was definitely
better than the original Friday the 13th.

536
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:19,013
I mean, Kevin Baker was acting on a whole other level.

537
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,386
Alright, I'm gonna get going.

538
00:28:20,613 --> 00:28:21,826
I'm coming with you.
No, no no.

539
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,653
You have class.
Besides, you can do more here on campus than with me.

540
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:26,960
OK?

541
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
I have to say,
I though it was fantastic.

542
00:28:30,546 --> 00:28:32,826
Yeah. No, I though the blood was
way off. It looked too fake.

543
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:36,946
Please, Sheila. I was backstage
with you, you almost wet your pants in fear.

544
00:28:37,493 --> 00:28:38,586
He definitely shouldn't have got expelled.

545
00:28:39,306 --> 00:28:42,026
No, it was honestly like
a really good performance.

546
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,600
OK, OK, OK. Guys, guys, guys.
I know you're upset.

547
00:28:46,693 --> 00:28:47,933
I hear you.

548
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:52,720
And there are a lot of other students in the shcool
that feel the same way, but the question is,

549
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,720
What can you do about it.

550
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,866
Exactly, what can we do about it.

551
00:28:57,453 --> 00:28:58,360
Lawrence.

552
00:28:58,613 --> 00:28:59,946
What is your film about?

553
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,733
WAM. Right, what else?

554
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,346
Well, it's a musical retrospective.

555
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,340
That's the subject.

556
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,946
What is it about?

557
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,826
George Michael's

558
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:12,173
fall from grace?

559
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,053
Politically.

560
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,050
Why did you make it?

561
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:18,693
I like WAM.

562
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,346
The thing I love about your film,

563
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,986
is it's political slam.

564
00:29:22,186 --> 00:29:25,493
Now, clearly, it's a statement
about your feelings being gay?

565
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:30,146
And being targeted by the police, and by
the public, and by society at large, right?

566
00:29:30,346 --> 00:29:31,760
Lawrence is gay?

567
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:34,666
Charlotte, you're video, talked to me.

568
00:29:36,493 --> 00:29:37,320
Razor Blades.

569
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,653
All instruments used in the barbaric
procedure of clitoral mutilation.

570
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,506
Usually, these items are unsanitized
before being used to rip out the young girl's genitalia.

571
00:29:49,586 --> 00:29:53,760
This fowl mouth, little hippy girl is turning
this in as a school project?

572
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,093
This is not art.

573
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,090
I don't know who Mr. Drucker thinks he is.

574
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,333
You intelligently make a statement.

575
00:29:59,653 --> 00:30:02,320
To stir people up, to make some change. Right?

576
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:04,906
But let me ask you this:

577
00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:07,440
How many women do you
personally know,

578
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:09,440
who have had their clitorises mutilated?

579
00:30:10,346 --> 00:30:11,440
Um...

580
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,840
None.

581
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,573
And how many women do you know,
that know women who have had their
clitorises mutilated?

582
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,106
None. Now,

583
00:30:21,493 --> 00:30:23,373
that's a cause worth fighting for,

584
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:27,266
But it might be better to fight for a
cause that's closer to home.

585
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,053
Not better, different.

586
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,853
Now, I hear you guys screaming up and down
about what happened to Holden,

587
00:30:33,026 --> 00:30:35,946
but I'm saying to you:
do something about it!

588
00:30:36,426 --> 00:30:37,466
Mr. D?

589
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,460
I think the word is: "clitori".

590
00:30:39,826 --> 00:30:40,666
Oh, stop it.

591
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,253
Thank you very much Mr.---
It's disgraceful.

592
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,253
Donna, I once performed in a staged
reading of Oliver Stone's "Platoon",

593
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,466
Where we deleted all the
expletives, it worked!

594
00:30:48,946 --> 00:30:50,546
I was, Willem Dafoe.

595
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,540
I can play weird-looking people too.

596
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,973
Yes,

597
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:55,333
thank you.

598
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,053
How long are we
gonna wait for him?

599
00:31:04,093 --> 00:31:06,253
No, he'll be here.
He said 20:00

600
00:31:06,946 --> 00:31:08,250
Can I get you guys anything?

601
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,250
Herbal tea? Cookies?

602
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,250
Bullhorn? Handcuffs?

603
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,250
You told your Mom we're protesting?

604
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,250
No... my Mom is cool.
She's---

605
00:31:16,426 --> 00:31:19,626
demonstrated against like three wars,
and against like, other junk.

606
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:21,853
Thanks, Honey.
I'm glad I made such an impact.

607
00:31:22,026 --> 00:31:23,653
What did you use handcuffs for?

608
00:31:23,746 --> 00:31:25,650
Well, in 82 a bunch of us

609
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,600
used handcuffs, to chain ourselves
around animal testing centers.

610
00:31:30,506 --> 00:31:32,600
Ah, and they're not
bad to use in the sack, either.

611
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,586
Mom, Gross!

612
00:31:35,413 --> 00:31:38,146
I'm sorry honey, I forgot.
You still think I'm a virgin.

613
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,746
Hey Holden, my Mom was just leaving.
No...

614
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,880
You should stay.
Totally, she's way cool.

615
00:31:45,106 --> 00:31:46,573
Way? Way.

616
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,813
I'd bet she's even fine with
Holden trying to stoop her Daughter.

617
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,560
Shut up Veronica, yeah, shut up Mary.
Uh, Mrs. Pratt,

618
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:52,693
Holden.

619
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:54,520
Please ignore my friends, I'm not

620
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,373
I mean, it's not really, I

621
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,853
Right, yeah.
If you're the

622
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:00,360
first teenage boy I ever met,
and I completely believe you.

623
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:05,453
OK uh, why don't we just all stop this,
and talk about why we're all here.

624
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:08,280
We need to stop what is being done to us.

625
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,066
Being done to us, don't you mean: "being done to you"?
You don't see us expelled.

626
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,346
Your right.

627
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,400
If anybody here is worried about
getting expelled, you should probably leave now.

628
00:32:18,346 --> 00:32:19,240
Anybody?

629
00:32:23,106 --> 00:32:23,826
Talk to us!

630
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:27,026
This administration claims
they want to challenge our way of thinking. Yet,

631
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:32,280
any time we rise to that challenge, if it doesn't support
Weller's bid to become grand pooba of all schools, then---

632
00:32:32,906 --> 00:32:34,093
She wants us gone.

633
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:37,480
Do as I say, not as I do.
Eat shit, smile about it!

634
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,493
Excuse me.

635
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,560
Fuck it.

636
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,346
We all in?

637
00:32:44,426 --> 00:32:46,093
Alright, let's do it.
I'm in.

638
00:32:46,626 --> 00:32:47,346
Yeah.

639
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,333
What's the plan?

640
00:32:49,493 --> 00:32:52,373
Ah, that's where we run into a slight hiccup.

641
00:32:54,546 --> 00:32:55,653
No plan!

642
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,240
What kind of plan is that?

643
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,746
Alright, it's not exactly a plan.
It's more like a work in progress.

644
00:33:00,906 --> 00:33:05,040
God, I'm so with you. I'm like Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
and you're Winston Churchill.

645
00:33:05,546 --> 00:33:08,613
Remember, it was Victor Hugo who said,
freedom in art, freedom in society.

646
00:33:08,893 --> 00:33:10,720
And it's a double good which
all consistent

647
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:12,200
and logical minds must strive.

648
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,386
Was that really Chuck Meagan?

649
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,733
Nah, Chuck just got into Yale.
Really action.

650
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:23,226
You can't judge a book by it's cover.

651
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,306
What does my book cover look like?

652
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,613
Sweet.

653
00:33:29,613 --> 00:33:31,610
And... innocent.

654
00:33:31,866 --> 00:33:33,610
You've picked up the wrong book.

655
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,586
So,

656
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:40,680
what do you want to do?

657
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,280
Do you want to see a movie?

658
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:50,133
Michael row the boat ashore,

659
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:54,146
Halleluya.

660
00:33:54,386 --> 00:33:56,226
Michael row---

661
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,080
1954

662
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,280
Guatemala. The United States army,

663
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,533
overthrew a democratically elected president,

664
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:05,000
Then what?

665
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:07,626
200,000 civilians are killed.

666
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,546
1963-1975

667
00:34:10,733 --> 00:34:12,920
4 million dead in South-East Asia.

668
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,773
1982

669
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,826
Billions given to Saddam Hussein

670
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,080
to kill Iranians.

671
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,666
1983,

672
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,333
Iran, is secretly given weapons
by the white house, to kill

673
00:34:23,586 --> 00:34:24,920
Iraqis.

674
00:34:24,986 --> 00:34:27,466
Look it up, it's in your history book.

675
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,826
Oh, yeah. My mistake.

676
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:31,820
It's not!

677
00:34:33,426 --> 00:34:34,773
He was amazing, huh?

678
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,786
What the hell is he doing teaching high-school English?

679
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:41,533
I don't know, but he obviously has made pretty
powerful enemies with his documentary.

680
00:34:41,906 --> 00:34:43,173
How did you find this one?

681
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,306
I worked in a video store last summer,

682
00:34:45,413 --> 00:34:46,786
stumbled onto it one day.

683
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,720
Do you take your salary movies?

684
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:53,186
Pretty much, yeah.

685
00:34:55,546 --> 00:34:56,480
What's your favorite?

686
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:57,893
Uh,

687
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,306
impossible question.

688
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,986
I means, it is "The Godfather",

689
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,386
Better than "American Beauty" is uh, is

690
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,746
"Pulp Fiction" any better than "All About Eve"?
Besides,

691
00:35:06,973 --> 00:35:08,740
If I chose one then,

692
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:10,740
the others might get jealous.

693
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,533
Say anything.

694
00:35:16,653 --> 00:35:18,120
I've never seen this one.

695
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,186
Are you kidding me?

696
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:21,946
It's brilliant.

697
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,466
One of my

698
00:35:24,013 --> 00:35:26,093
favorite on-screen kisses of all time.

699
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:30,066
What makes it so great?

700
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,240
It's, buried in the movie.

701
00:35:34,346 --> 00:35:36,106
The last like 5 seconds it's

702
00:35:36,626 --> 00:35:39,040
partially blurred by something in the foreground.

703
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,600
It's so simple it just,

704
00:35:42,093 --> 00:35:43,813
Ione Skye and John Cusack.

705
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:46,226
Kissing in the rain.
You know, all bunned up.

706
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,600
Her hair is,

707
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,400
Tied back in a ponytail.

708
00:35:50,466 --> 00:35:53,506
It's all grey and dark, but there's something,

709
00:35:54,146 --> 00:35:56,853
magical about it, it's like their first kiss.

710
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:58,850
And their last kiss, all

711
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:00,400
wrapped in one.

712
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:03,973
I, I, I don't like them.

713
00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:05,160
You gotta see it.

714
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,600
Show me.

715
00:36:28,026 --> 00:36:30,213
I want you.

716
00:36:30,826 --> 00:36:32,400
I want you.

717
00:36:33,466 --> 00:36:35,120
I want you.

718
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,053
So bad.

719
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,946
Honey, I want you.

720
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:46,720
She is good to me.

721
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,546
There's nothing that she doesn't see.

722
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,280
She knows where I would like to be.

723
00:36:53,373 --> 00:36:55,226
It doesn't matter if I was---

724
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,106
I want you.

725
00:36:58,093 --> 00:36:59,853
I want you.

726
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:02,360
I want you.

727
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,813
So bad.

728
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,040
When I want you.

729
00:37:08,453 --> 00:37:11,346
I want you. I like that movie.
Me too.

730
00:37:12,973 --> 00:37:14,373
What other movies do you like?

731
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,013
I got it.

732
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,026
I got, I got a plan!

733
00:38:34,093 --> 00:38:36,680
Ugh, you couldn't have waited
a little longer to come up with the plan?

734
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,680
I, uh. I mean, I guess.

735
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,946
I could use a little more time to formulate my plan.

736
00:38:48,253 --> 00:38:50,760
Oh, my God. Who wrote this?

737
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:56,346
This is so... I don't know, what's the word?
Oh yeah. Stupid!

738
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,613
Supporting that nut-job Holden Donovan
who faked suicide?

739
00:38:59,746 --> 00:39:02,626
I wish that weirdo would've
just done it. He's creepy.

740
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,866
Like Mansen.

741
00:39:03,946 --> 00:39:06,573
Charles or Marilyn,
take or pick a creepo.

742
00:39:06,693 --> 00:39:08,226
Spot on, Kelly.

743
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:09,960
Now, this is what I'm talking about.

744
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,346
This is what Brother Martin, and Brother Malcolm and Sister Maya were talking about.

745
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,520
Who's sister Maya?

746
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,200
Oh, well, she was in Mulan Ruje.

747
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:22,533
This be a definite call to action against---

748
00:39:25,106 --> 00:39:26,866
The powers.

749
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,333
There.

750
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:32,840
Hope, success,

751
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,146
I don't know you guys,

752
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:37,400
I think Holden is...
kind of moving.

753
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,493
I think he's sexy.

754
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:41,960
Ewwwwwww

755
00:39:42,026 --> 00:39:42,813
Well,

756
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:46,440
whoever wrote this
manifesto should be expelled.

757
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:49,093
You're right, Ed.
I say we stamp out freedom of speech,

758
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:52,320
Wherever, and whenever possible---
Oh, please Jane.

759
00:39:52,613 --> 00:39:54,853
Freedom of speech was brought
about to make people think.

760
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,746
That suicide attempt on Holiday Hoopla
only made people want to vomit.

761
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,933
Nah, I don't know Kemp. I'd say people are thinking.
Look, we're still arguing about it 4 days later.

762
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,080
Does anybody know
what this "12|15" means?

763
00:40:11,853 --> 00:40:14,266
We, the silence screamers
of Booker High,

764
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:18,160
draw from the words of our forefathers
to unite our fellow students.

765
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:22,960
We call on you, to through down your textbooks,
your slide rules, your latest computer games.

766
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:27,373
For now is the time to come out behind your
clicks and classmates and stand up to be recognized

767
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:30,280
Uhgh, these cheeky kids are 'F'ing me.

768
00:40:34,946 --> 00:40:36,080
Get in here!

769
00:40:37,653 --> 00:40:39,520
What is it,
do you know who's responsible for this?

770
00:40:39,786 --> 00:40:42,920
What "No"? Why are you standing there?
Go bring me his head now!

771
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,240
What?! What is it?
What is it boy?

772
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
Did Timmy fall down a well?
Go!

773
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,213
God, you're useless.

774
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,933
Useless!

775
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,586
Jesus.

776
00:40:53,626 --> 00:40:54,946
The first

777
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,480
paragraph of any article we're ever writing,
must always

778
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,000
The 5 'W's:
Who, what

779
00:41:02,266 --> 00:41:04,213
Where, why,

780
00:41:04,946 --> 00:41:06,210
and uhhh...

781
00:41:06,973 --> 00:41:08,210
and when.

782
00:41:08,826 --> 00:41:10,346
Why? Because---

783
00:41:10,746 --> 00:41:12,340
Hustle up!

784
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:16,466
Come on, get up there!

785
00:41:20,026 --> 00:41:21,986
Reitzer, climb the rope!

786
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,146
Use your legs!

787
00:41:25,426 --> 00:41:28,626
Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

788
00:41:28,973 --> 00:41:30,626
Thou art more lovely,

789
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,106
and more temperate.

790
00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:35,666
Rough winds, do shake the---

791
00:41:35,733 --> 00:41:37,660
Darling, buds of May.

792
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,213
And summer's leafs.
Excuse me?

793
00:41:40,573 --> 00:41:41,813
This is not the interval

794
00:41:42,093 --> 00:41:43,810
All the way up, come on.

795
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:45,810
It's time.

796
00:41:47,293 --> 00:41:48,693
Where are you going?

797
00:41:50,293 --> 00:41:52,640
You can't just leave class,
get back here.

798
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,600
It's a fascinating predicament. I mean, put yourself
in his shoes. You're a journalist,

799
00:41:58,973 --> 00:42:01,053
You're approached by people you don't know.

800
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,173
They, they call you Kennith...

801
00:42:03,386 --> 00:42:04,600
Not your name.

802
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,600
And--- hey guys?

803
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:25,693
And that is why we all have
to fight for a change at this school.

804
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,640
Suspension!

805
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,640
For promoting safe sex.

806
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,866
Suspension, for writing poetry
in a personal journal.

807
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,560
Suspension, for the performance
of an art peace?

808
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,573
What's next?

809
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,720
Suspension for bad fashion sense?

810
00:42:48,346 --> 00:42:49,813
Weller is on her way.

811
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,760
Come on.

812
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:55,186
She's mad.
Since when was the bill of rights,

813
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,520
rewritten to exclude the students
at Booker High School?

814
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:02,560
And Weller in 7,

815
00:43:02,866 --> 00:43:04,693
Six,--- Now!
Five.

816
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:05,626
4,

817
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,626
3

818
00:43:06,893 --> 00:43:07,800
2

819
00:43:07,946 --> 00:43:08,826
1

820
00:43:31,546 --> 00:43:34,666
You will fail yourselves,
you'll fail your fellow journalists.

821
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,720
You'll fail your editor,
and you will

822
00:43:38,826 --> 00:43:41,613
What, what is going on?
I have to go number 2.

823
00:43:41,773 --> 00:43:42,493
Ew.

824
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:45,293
What, you needed a possy?

825
00:43:45,413 --> 00:43:48,413
OK, OK. So... who can tell me
which date,

826
00:43:48,613 --> 00:43:51,000
the bill of rights was added to your constitution?

827
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,453
December 15th 1791

828
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,853
Very good, Very good.
December.

829
00:43:58,533 --> 00:43:59,850
15th

830
00:44:03,826 --> 00:44:06,026
17, 90

831
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,020
1

832
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:10,666
On the wall, the crapper.

833
00:44:12,013 --> 00:44:14,880
He, somebody wrote there little
manifesto on the wall of the crapper.

834
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,160
Damn, Son. I like you kids today.

835
00:44:18,986 --> 00:44:20,560
And then Charlotte Pratt, who's

836
00:44:20,693 --> 00:44:24,413
really cool. Not the weird fish groupy
tied eyed hippie chick I though she was.

837
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,306
Said, what's next?
Suspension for bad fashion sense?

838
00:44:28,106 --> 00:44:32,840
Of course, you know, Kelly and Ashley didn't participate. They
said that they were cheer leaders, and not cheer followers.

839
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,146
But you know what?
I think it's really cool.

840
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,653
Mom, did... did you ever protest anything?

841
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,933
Sergeant, refresh my memory.

842
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:49,706
Did the soy sauce come out
of my flowered print dress?

843
00:44:52,013 --> 00:44:54,000
I dropped it off at the Chinese laundry.

844
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,773
I figured, they'd know
how to get out their own sauce.

845
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,770
Sergeant, the drink.

846
00:45:00,386 --> 00:45:01,973
What is it, by the way?
Um.

847
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,293
I asked if you ever protested anything?

848
00:45:04,653 --> 00:45:05,666
haha

849
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,453
I remember she burned her bra.
Well,---

850
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:12,146
But, that lasted only about a week
and a day,

851
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,813
since she complained, of a chafed nipple.

852
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,160
I'm really happy
things went well today.

853
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,680
But I have to warn you, if your principal
calls me, I may have to tell her to kiss my ass.

854
00:45:27,746 --> 00:45:29,133
OK.

855
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,586
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

856
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,580
I love you.
love you.

857
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,346
Oh, and by the way,

858
00:45:38,466 --> 00:45:40,586
I want Holden heading home in about 10 minutes.

859
00:45:40,866 --> 00:45:41,906
What?

860
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,900
Do I really have to open the closet door?

861
00:45:44,053 --> 00:45:45,900
Good night, Mrs. Pratt.

862
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,900
Good night, Holden.

863
00:45:53,266 --> 00:45:54,000
Sorry.

864
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,093
It was worth a shot.

865
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,240
You were amazing today.

866
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,680
I should get going.

867
00:46:08,826 --> 00:46:09,773
Did I mention that,

868
00:46:10,613 --> 00:46:11,770
I should get going?

869
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,770
Yes, you did metion that.

870
00:46:18,453 --> 00:46:19,480
Hi!

871
00:46:20,866 --> 00:46:21,866
Let me show you the way.

872
00:46:22,573 --> 00:46:25,400
Well, you're being paranoid.
Who has it out for you?

873
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,400
Weller is serious this time.

874
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:29,400
I can get fired.

875
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,853
I don't know, Will.
Maybe you should ease up for a while.

876
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,653
And... if I do, what
does that say to these kids?

877
00:46:39,226 --> 00:46:41,200
Look, Will. I'm here for you.

878
00:46:41,826 --> 00:46:45,586
But keep in mind, it's hard to fight
the good fight, when you're not playing in the game.

879
00:46:46,853 --> 00:46:47,580
Hey,

880
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:54,133
You do want to play in the game, don't you?

881
00:46:55,373 --> 00:46:58,720
Only if you're gonna put on that cheerleading outfit again.
Again?

882
00:46:59,306 --> 00:47:00,840
Let me rip it off of you,

883
00:47:06,626 --> 00:47:10,000
Why, if it isn't Nelson Mandela.
Hey, Mr. D.

884
00:47:10,413 --> 00:47:12,000
Where have you been?
Hiding.

885
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,546
The school board meeting was tonight,
and I was the first order of business.

886
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,706
You, I hear you negotiated yourself
out of a suspension into an expulsion?

887
00:47:21,053 --> 00:47:23,186
Yeah, you can't win
a war without some casualties, right?

888
00:47:23,826 --> 00:47:25,360
How did your parents take the expulsion?

889
00:47:25,453 --> 00:47:27,600
I'll let you know when they
stop fighting long enough to hear about it.

890
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,333
You just hang tight.

891
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,880
I'm gonna see Weller tomorrow
about getting you back in school.

892
00:47:34,453 --> 00:47:37,280
We're getting things back to normal.
I don't want things to get back to normal.

893
00:47:38,226 --> 00:47:40,586
If they do, what was the point
of getting kicked out in the first place?

894
00:47:40,933 --> 00:47:42,580
The point wasn't to get kicked out.

895
00:47:43,253 --> 00:47:44,580
The point was to be heard.

896
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:46,580
And you were.

897
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:48,580
What about you. Were you heard?

898
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,680
I saw your films, they were amazing.
And now you're in the middle of nowhere,
teaching a bunch of high school kids?

899
00:47:54,213 --> 00:47:55,120
Why bother?

900
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,800
I came here to ask you,
to give a kid some slack.

901
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:11,053
And you suggest, a leave of absence?

902
00:48:11,946 --> 00:48:13,506
Well, it might do you some good.

903
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:18,000
Look, I can't have you inciting these
children anymore, it's getting dangerous.

904
00:48:18,586 --> 00:48:23,493
Donna, Donna. Why can't you listen to
these kids? They are not dangerous, they are smart!

905
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,490
They are passionate.

906
00:48:25,586 --> 00:48:27,490
They're They are idealistic.

907
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,440
Are you telling me that
I don't listen to my students?

908
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,720
I'm trying to create an environment here,

909
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,853
where the students who want to learn, can!

910
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,733
There's no room--- For, for what? Thought?

911
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,506
For being heard?
That is all these kids want!

912
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:50,400
They are seeking answers to what they
see as inherent hypocrisy in the system!

913
00:48:50,746 --> 00:48:53,440
High school is not a democracy,
OK?

914
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:58,213
These kids, need mentors, who are going to push them
to improve their reading and writing skills.

915
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,786
Who are going to encourage them
to achieve higher test scores--- I, I agree.

916
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,746
I agree, and that is
exactly what I'm doing.

917
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,106
No, no no no no. What you were doing
was encouraging them to revolt.

918
00:49:07,106 --> 00:49:09,100
And you're giving them a reason to.

919
00:49:11,453 --> 00:49:13,200
I have no choice, but to let you go.

920
00:49:16,973 --> 00:49:20,173
Well then, we're just gonna
have to see what the union says about that.

921
00:49:23,266 --> 00:49:25,093
Well, I'm happy,

922
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,090
to reconsider your suspension.

923
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:30,426
If you'll reconsider your teaching style.

924
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,186
I'd rather be fired.

925
00:49:40,693 --> 00:49:42,053
Mary Poppins.

926
00:49:43,293 --> 00:49:44,573
Greece one.

927
00:49:44,893 --> 00:49:45,826
Greece two.

928
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,773
Sergeant Pepper's lonely hearts club banned.

929
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,320
The movie.

930
00:49:51,866 --> 00:49:55,080
What do all these films
have in common, hm?

931
00:49:58,666 --> 00:50:02,920
OK. Comedy, fun, entertainment.

932
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,266
OK, Mr. Drucker might be gone,

933
00:50:05,693 --> 00:50:08,133
but that doesn't mean that this AV class,

934
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:10,130
isn't going to kick butt.

935
00:50:10,306 --> 00:50:12,520
And make the best, darn

936
00:50:12,626 --> 00:50:16,306
making of the prom video, ever!

937
00:50:16,826 --> 00:50:17,986
I don't think so.

938
00:50:18,213 --> 00:50:20,533
Ohhh, looks like she told you,
Red beard.

939
00:50:20,866 --> 00:50:22,530
Come on you guys.

940
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:25,866
Lucky that man didn't mention the---
We're outta here.

941
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:29,333
Is anyone up for a corn dog?
The Greek philosopher Heraclitus once wrote

942
00:50:29,546 --> 00:50:32,280
there is nothing permanent except change.

943
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,346
And as you walk through life as students,
and later on as adults,

944
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:42,546
Hopefully, this idea, will help you to deal the with many
twists and turns that life delivers you.

945
00:50:43,786 --> 00:50:49,560
On one other note, today's special is Shepard's Pie
Not Salisbury Steak as featured on the lunchroom menu.

946
00:50:50,626 --> 00:50:52,066
So, students.

947
00:50:52,506 --> 00:50:57,920
Let's go out there and have a calm,
wonderful day.

948
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,813
Ben!

949
00:51:01,453 --> 00:51:02,810
Ben!

950
00:51:03,946 --> 00:51:06,226
Can we wed the GD
mircophone fixed?

951
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:10,186
I feel like officiating a piding
contest with the state fare.

952
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,333
Hi, Ben!
Hmm?

953
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,506
Get the kids in here.
Oh, well. Mm hmm.

954
00:51:15,653 --> 00:51:17,093
OK kids, she'll see you now.

955
00:51:18,586 --> 00:51:19,226
Hi.

956
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,080
Come on in,
come in, come in.

957
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,080
What can I do for you?

958
00:51:24,466 --> 00:51:27,960
Well, Principal Weller,
we're all umm,

959
00:51:28,106 --> 00:51:28,880
Curious---

960
00:51:28,973 --> 00:51:32,120
At to why Mr. Drucker is no longer working here!

961
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,253
Well, Mrs. Pratt.

962
00:51:34,653 --> 00:51:37,373
It's not the custom of the
Principal, to elucidate

963
00:51:37,466 --> 00:51:40,746
the students, as to his or her
professional decisions, but,

964
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,973
since I do care,

965
00:51:42,973 --> 00:51:44,970
for each and every one of you

966
00:51:45,933 --> 00:51:47,440
I will share this with you.

967
00:51:47,906 --> 00:51:49,413
After reviewing

968
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,746
Mr. Drucker's many years of meritorious
service to this educational institution,

969
00:51:54,213 --> 00:51:55,960
I am of the opinion, that he and I,

970
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,760
no longer share,

971
00:51:57,893 --> 00:51:59,466
the same philosophies.

972
00:51:59,586 --> 00:52:02,000
As to the best way to nurture, and in inspirit

973
00:52:02,293 --> 00:52:03,293
young minds.

974
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,706
Um,

975
00:52:04,786 --> 00:52:07,600
did you just come from an SAT study course,
or do you really talk like that?

976
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:10,013
So you just, threw him out?

977
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,720
Mr. D. was the best teacher here!

978
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,880
Yeah, I think I've had just about enough
of this conversation, and look at that?

979
00:52:15,973 --> 00:52:18,066
You're all tardy for last period.

980
00:52:18,413 --> 00:52:20,946
You can pick up your "Tardy"
slips with my assistant on the way out.

981
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:23,720
Umm, Principal Weller?

982
00:52:23,826 --> 00:52:25,720
As the resident theater techy,

983
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,253
I think I might be able
to fix your intercom system.

984
00:52:28,506 --> 00:52:29,706
Really, Emily?

985
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,700
Well, that would be very
helpful. Thank you.

986
00:52:32,013 --> 00:52:33,226
Super.

987
00:52:35,306 --> 00:52:36,466
Kissass.

988
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,560
Brown knows her.

989
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,533
Little Betty do good.

990
00:52:47,933 --> 00:52:49,400
So, did it work?

991
00:52:49,453 --> 00:52:50,720
Like a charm.

992
00:52:51,693 --> 00:52:54,680
"Little Betty do good"?!
What? I like to improvise.

993
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,973
Oh, really? Thank God.
'Cause I thought that was really mean.

994
00:52:57,373 --> 00:52:59,826
Are you joking, or
do you just look like a moron?

995
00:53:00,253 --> 00:53:01,346
Do I really look like a moron?

996
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,453
No, Donatela, you're on Mr. Blackwell's
list of 10 best dressed.

997
00:53:05,773 --> 00:53:07,450
Please, you make

998
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,120
Elton John, Circuit 1974 look like

999
00:53:10,466 --> 00:53:11,186
Hugo Boss.

1000
00:53:13,933 --> 00:53:17,146
You know, sometimes your lips move,
and I have no idea what your saying.

1001
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,266
Great so,
we're all on for tomorrow?

1002
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,066
Bring it on!
Yeah, let's do it, let's do it.

1003
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,640
Alright, I'm gonna get going.

1004
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,240
Oh, what? You can't give us a ride?

1005
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,960
Yeah Hold, I'm an outlaw.

1006
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,960
Outlaws don't take the bus.

1007
00:53:28,786 --> 00:53:29,960
Alright.

1008
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,840
Who's first?
Me. Me. Me.

1009
00:53:32,773 --> 00:53:33,840
Mm Hmm.

1010
00:53:34,106 --> 00:53:35,666
And look what in Rose, her head.

1011
00:53:35,906 --> 00:53:39,360
Ohhh, yeah!
I mean I'm just saying.

1012
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,506
Yaho!

1013
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:43,810
She'd had died in the Gulf War.

1014
00:53:43,933 --> 00:53:45,600
Yeah, he was a medic.

1015
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:49,013
But I mean, his death
made me want to do something with my life.

1016
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,680
You know?

1017
00:53:50,786 --> 00:53:53,146
Inspire people with words,
instead of guns.

1018
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:56,840
Well, you've inspired me.

1019
00:54:00,773 --> 00:54:02,040
How about you're parents?

1020
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,906
Uhhh, not

1021
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,480
very much like yours.
I mean there's uh

1022
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,413
No "Make love not war" bumper
stickers if you know what I mean.

1023
00:54:14,946 --> 00:54:16,160
I mean,

1024
00:54:18,093 --> 00:54:19,106
would you like to?

1025
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,360
Well,

1026
00:54:22,746 --> 00:54:24,066
Make love.

1027
00:54:25,706 --> 00:54:26,440
What do you mean?

1028
00:54:26,573 --> 00:54:27,746
You're serious?

1029
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,226
I was just wondering why
you hadn't asked me yet.

1030
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,893
I don't know, I was just,
I wanted to be,

1031
00:54:33,973 --> 00:54:35,306
respectful.

1032
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:35,800
And,

1033
00:54:36,586 --> 00:54:38,386
I'm tired of being respected.

1034
00:54:50,893 --> 00:54:52,040
What are you looking for?

1035
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,080
Uhh, Holden?

1036
00:55:11,866 --> 00:55:14,986
I know you're 17, and that's a guy's
sexual prime, but---

1037
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,466
Come on!

1038
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:19,160
It's getting a little bit
rediculous, don't you think?

1039
00:55:25,466 --> 00:55:27,626
Little ambition, aren't we?

1040
00:55:27,786 --> 00:55:29,620
They're not for us.

1041
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:31,960
Then, who are they for?

1042
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,440
Well, she can't suspend all of us.

1043
00:55:36,786 --> 00:55:37,480
Can she?

1044
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,440
And my job here is to mold

1045
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,693
Each and every one of you
into upstanding citizens.

1046
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:46,480
I have to say, that I feel
you're losing sight of the reason

1047
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,973
why you are here.
This morning's demonstration

1048
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,480
is disruptive to your education and will not be tolerated.

1049
00:55:53,773 --> 00:55:58,613
Following the tragedy in this country of 9.11
our federal government instituted the patriot act.

1050
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,986
Giving the FBI new powers
of search and seizure.

1051
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,826
In the spirit of this act,
I will be overseeing our school

1052
00:56:05,906 --> 00:56:09,973
in much the same way that our government
has deemed necessary to oversee

1053
00:56:10,253 --> 00:56:11,573
our nation.

1054
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,853
Freedom, is not always an unequivocal

1055
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:16,893
right.

1056
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,893
We must safeguard it

1057
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,560
Good morning, my formal classmates, and

1058
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:24,000
hello you too, Donna.

1059
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:28,333
Sorry to interrupt your morning dribble
fascinating as it sounded, but

1060
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,373
as my good buddy Ben Franklin once said,
those of us who would sacrifice--- Ben? good freedom for

1061
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,533
temporary safety, deserve neither
to be safe, nor free.

1062
00:56:37,893 --> 00:56:40,360
I invite you, the students of Booker High,

1063
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:46,826
to join us in the fight against the virus that is the current
administration. A virus that could spread state-wide, if

1064
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,266
Donna Weller is elected superintendent.

1065
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,986
What could possible be wrong with employing a
faculty member voter "best teacher

1066
00:56:53,066 --> 00:56:55,360
of the year", five years in a row.

1067
00:56:55,466 --> 00:56:56,520
By all of you.

1068
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:58,520
Where is he? Find him, now!

1069
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:00,613
I invite you, to join us.

1070
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,506
Donna, we got him.
Stand up!

1071
00:57:02,626 --> 00:57:05,853
Change the world,
for we have only begun to fight!

1072
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,373
We got him.

1073
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,560
Yeah, this is it.

1074
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:27,213
No no. No no, no no no.
Lawrence Reitzer, stop it!

1075
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,946
That, young man,
that just earned you a suspension.

1076
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,293
This has got "front page of the newspaper"
written all over it.

1077
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,680
Look, I said no, and that is

1078
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:36,680
final!

1079
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,533
Why not?

1080
00:57:37,586 --> 00:57:41,160
'Cause this is a high school?
Ok? will you get real?

1081
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,106
I am trying to be.

1082
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,373
But you won't let me.

1083
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:45,226
Y, you, you push Charlotte.
You push and push some more, and
But you won't let me.

1084
00:57:45,226 --> 00:57:48,720
Y, you, you push Charlotte.
You push and push some more, and

1085
00:57:49,226 --> 00:57:51,733
I have decided to let Erin Robinson

1086
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,773
take over, as

1087
00:57:53,933 --> 00:57:55,533
editor in chief.

1088
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:59,426
She wrote an absolutely beautiful
editorial, urging the

1089
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,420
Administration of the school to

1090
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:05,040
consider adopting school uniforms,
and, well, she just hit it out of the park.

1091
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:07,920
And I think you might wanna
take a page from her book.

1092
00:58:08,506 --> 00:58:11,106
What book is that?
"The idiot's guide to kissing ass"?

1093
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:13,100
Wow,

1094
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,706
You are always "Mrs. Goody Goody".

1095
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,440
And I'm always the bad guy.

1096
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,640
I am sick and tired of you,

1097
00:58:21,693 --> 00:58:23,746
always being so perfect!

1098
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:26,066
Well, why don't you straighten-out your life,

1099
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,333
Tony Scampenino,

1100
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,853
Ever since you've been hanging out
with them stinkpots Freddy and Chicko,

1101
00:58:30,933 --> 00:58:33,213
You've been no good to me,
no how.

1102
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,573
I know those no good bubs do drugs,
I bet you do drugs,

1103
00:58:36,573 --> 00:58:38,570
Too.
Oh, my god...

1104
00:58:39,253 --> 00:58:41,346
I hate, drug awareness week.

1105
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,346
I don't know,

1106
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,746
I've seen better acting in porn.

1107
00:58:45,453 --> 00:58:46,973
Not that, I like porn.

1108
00:58:50,746 --> 00:58:51,853
I like porn.

1109
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:52,973
Really?

1110
00:58:53,466 --> 00:58:54,970
Ah ha, joking.

1111
00:58:55,253 --> 00:58:57,386
OK, wow.
New rule:

1112
00:58:57,493 --> 00:58:59,200
You can't touch me anymore,
OK?

1113
00:59:00,653 --> 00:59:03,146
You hang out with your homies,
you smoke pot.

1114
00:59:03,213 --> 00:59:05,520
You snort cock,
you take ecstasy,

1115
00:59:05,573 --> 00:59:07,520
You mainline heroin.

1116
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:17,560
I don't have much time.

1117
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,706
I'm here to ask you all,
to take a second, and look inside yourselves.

1118
00:59:21,093 --> 00:59:24,240
I do so, in the wake of another,
appalling act by

1119
00:59:24,653 --> 00:59:27,013
You guessed it, our very own Principal Weller.
Yeah!

1120
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,840
It appears yesterday, one of our own
was suspended for kissing his partner in the hallway.

1121
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:32,840
I'll give you a quick hint, too.

1122
00:59:37,813 --> 00:59:39,306
I shot this.

1123
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,173
No, it wasn't any of these people.
It appears that

1124
00:59:50,266 --> 00:59:54,573
our fellow classmate was suspended because he shared
the same genitalia as the person he was kissing.

1125
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,120
Shut him down.
Shut that down!

1126
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,973
Shut the whole building down
if you have to, now!

1127
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:05,120
In a protest against homophobia I challenge each and every
one of you, to find somebody of the same sex,

1128
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:05,760
And kiss them.

1129
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:07,400
That's gay!

1130
01:00:07,573 --> 01:00:08,746
That's the point.

1131
01:00:08,853 --> 01:00:10,293
He's in here somewhere.

1132
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,440
Find him!

1133
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,800
We cannot let Principal Weller's homophobia prevail.
what reason other than homophobia could she possible have for

1134
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,533
suspending just Lawrence Reiter
and Tim Spears for kissing.

1135
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,200
Support your fellow classmates.
She can't suspend all of us.

1136
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:23,466
Kiss away.

1137
01:00:25,213 --> 01:00:26,306
Come on!

1138
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,946
What are you guys waiting for?

1139
01:00:28,106 --> 01:00:29,266
You heard Holden!

1140
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:35,453
Come on, you guys!
Hey

1141
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:36,586
Come on!

1142
01:00:36,626 --> 01:00:38,520
You and me baby ain't

1143
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:43,906
nothing but mammals, so let's
do it like they do in the discovery channel.

1144
01:00:43,933 --> 01:00:47,426
Gonna you and me maybe ain't nothing but Mammals.

1145
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:51,960
So let's do it like they do on the discovery channel.
That's it, shut off the power right now!

1146
01:00:52,853 --> 01:00:55,160
I'm not afraid to suspend you,
or you.

1147
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,160
Or, any of you.
This is ridiculous.

1148
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,160
What are you doing?
You're on the basketball team.

1149
01:00:59,893 --> 01:01:01,160
That's it, that's enough.

1150
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,040
Nice.

1151
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,026
Hold it!

1152
01:01:07,866 --> 01:01:08,760
Ben!

1153
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,226
Where is he?

1154
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,453
Where is he,
find him, now!

1155
01:01:13,173 --> 01:01:14,426
Do not tell my wife.

1156
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,120
Hmm.
Not gonna.

1157
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:22,826
No no no. Baby, you and me are nothing but mammals
so let's do it like they do on the discovery channel.

1158
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:51,480
Thank you, thank you. Thank you my fellow compatriots.
Thank you for making this school, one of free thought.

1159
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,933
And don't forget to check out our

1160
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:56,080
Subtle message at the football game.

1161
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,026
Go team.

1162
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:13,600
Go check the cafeteria.

1163
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:29,400
It has been my great pleasure to have the opportunity
to work with Holden for 4 years.

1164
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:33,866
In that time, he has proven himself, an incredible
asset to the students around him.

1165
01:02:34,053 --> 01:02:37,786
He is a young man with exceptional skills,
and unusual sensitivity.

1166
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,853
I promise that Holden will not disappoint you.

1167
01:03:01,066 --> 01:03:03,546
We all know what to do? Yes.
10 4.

1168
01:03:03,666 --> 01:03:06,080
Over.
Chuck, what the hell are you wearing?

1169
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,080
In case we run into any unforeseen danger.

1170
01:03:08,346 --> 01:03:10,626
Problems can be many,
and multi-hued.

1171
01:03:10,933 --> 01:03:12,906
Alright.
Let's do this!

1172
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,560
Emily, Josh.

1173
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,066
Are you sure, that
this is a good idea? Trust me.

1174
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,626
So tell me now

1175
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,360
What do I have to do?

1176
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,866
To say things that will get through to you.

1177
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:42,760
I'll cross my fingers and I'll pray for you.

1178
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,693
So tell me now

1179
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:57,853
Larry, be careful.
Owe, God! My muscle. Larry? No, I'm OK.

1180
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:04,320
I'll cross my fingers and I'll pray for you
To somehow see this site!

1181
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:09,906
Call me more convinced.
Say there's a way to cure this loneliness.

1182
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,640
With common sense. This has got
"The Towering Inferno" written all over it.

1183
01:04:32,826 --> 01:04:35,853
So tell me now, what do I have to do.

1184
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:38,333
To say things that will get through to you.

1185
01:04:38,330 --> 01:04:40,853
Lorance!
Ahhhhhhh

1186
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,413
Ahhhhhhhh

1187
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:45,120
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

1188
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,746
Oh my God!
Ahhhhhh

1189
01:04:47,066 --> 01:04:49,360
Ahhhhhhhh!
Oh my god

1190
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,373
Ahhhhhhh
Ahhhhhh

1191
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,026
So Lorance is gonna be OK?

1192
01:04:55,853 --> 01:04:57,020
Oh, he's gonna be fine.

1193
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,020
Except that he'll be burned.

1194
01:05:00,893 --> 01:05:03,360
You should be more concerned
about youreslf right now.

1195
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,640
How the hell did this happen?

1196
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,693
I proposed we have a Maluau theme.

1197
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,506
And Lorance um,
had I grass skirt on.

1198
01:05:13,293 --> 01:05:14,893
On the school football field.

1199
01:05:16,186 --> 01:05:18,706
You know, you should really do something about
that fingerprinting machine

1200
01:05:18,813 --> 01:05:21,613
it wreaked absolute havoc on my
new French manicure. Look at this!

1201
01:05:22,133 --> 01:05:23,610
I want my Lawyer.

1202
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,610
This is racism.
Sister,

1203
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,453
I am blacker than you are.

1204
01:05:27,613 --> 01:05:29,450
This is not, racism.

1205
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:32,813
Uncle Tom,

1206
01:05:32,893 --> 01:05:37,346
No justice, no peace. No justice, no peace!
OK OK, hey hey hey. Relax Sweetie, OK?

1207
01:05:37,746 --> 01:05:38,680
Now,

1208
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,680
What the hell happened?

1209
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:45,240
My name is Charlotte, and
I don't appreciate being spoken down to.

1210
01:05:46,626 --> 01:05:47,506
OK.

1211
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,960
Charlotte.

1212
01:05:49,733 --> 01:05:50,960
What the hell happened?

1213
01:05:52,013 --> 01:05:53,906
And I don't appreciate profanity.

1214
01:05:53,986 --> 01:05:55,900
Uh, officers.

1215
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,200
I'll give you an example.

1216
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,293
It's kind of like, when you were a kid,

1217
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:02,173
And your parents said: "Don't play
ball in the house". You know?

1218
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,170
I... never did, but

1219
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:06,640
uh, no one ever said anything about
don't

1220
01:06:06,826 --> 01:06:08,333
burn down the high school football field.

1221
01:06:08,706 --> 01:06:11,106
Ah, I no speak, uh, English.

1222
01:06:11,853 --> 01:06:13,346
You want spring-roll?

1223
01:06:14,293 --> 01:06:15,340
Excuse me,

1224
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,280
you don't speak, any English?

1225
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,280
Yet, you go to school with all these kids?

1226
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,906
I'm not buying that.

1227
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,786
You want a licky licky?

1228
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,266
Ok,

1229
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,733
We are playing trick or dare.
Lawrence, pick dare.

1230
01:06:31,493 --> 01:06:33,813
I asked them to spontaneously combust,
and

1231
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,810
I never thought he'd actually do it.

1232
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,146
Hey, smart ass.

1233
01:06:38,386 --> 01:06:40,466
You know how much prison time
you can get for arson?

1234
01:06:43,573 --> 01:06:44,893
You hurt your friend.

1235
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,890
You could be looking at 20 years.

1236
01:06:47,626 --> 01:06:49,173
Leader of the crew.

1237
01:06:51,146 --> 01:06:52,653
Yo man, that's awful.

1238
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:55,640
You ordered a pizza with your one phone call?

1239
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:58,266
Yeah, pepperoni and sausage.

1240
01:06:59,133 --> 01:07:02,240
Emily, Walanda, and Katie
got outta here so fast, they won't be able to get a slice.

1241
01:07:02,613 --> 01:07:03,920
Uh, that's more for me.

1242
01:07:04,226 --> 01:07:05,586
Why, who did you call?

1243
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,840
Nobody.

1244
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,093
I'm staying in jail out of protest.

1245
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:13,760
Unlike Holden, who is staying here
because he's an ass.

1246
01:07:14,213 --> 01:07:15,666
Just thought I should call Mr. D.

1247
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,160
I kind of screwed things up with Mr. D.

1248
01:07:20,173 --> 01:07:21,933
I kind of screwed
up a lot of things.

1249
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:23,930
Charlotte,

1250
01:07:25,293 --> 01:07:27,226
you think you can get me that girl's number?
She's kind of hot.

1251
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,133
I expect an apology out of you.

1252
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,506
I told already, I'm sorry.

1253
01:07:36,906 --> 01:07:37,986
But not to me.

1254
01:07:49,026 --> 01:07:50,253
Thank you.

1255
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:52,360
Uh, I don't know what to say.

1256
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,360
I about,
"I'm not gonna jump bail"?

1257
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,866
That was my retirement money.
Yeah, no problem.

1258
01:07:59,693 --> 01:08:03,280
So, I here you negotiated yourself
out of a job and into unemployment?

1259
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,280
Just another casualty of war, I guess.

1260
01:08:06,226 --> 01:08:07,933
Look, I want to say something to you.

1261
01:08:08,306 --> 01:08:10,666
And I know your parents
don't care enough to say.

1262
01:08:11,146 --> 01:08:13,026
What you did last night was stupid.

1263
01:08:13,493 --> 01:08:15,020
It was dangerous.

1264
01:08:15,386 --> 01:08:17,813
And it sure as hell isn't
what I've been talking to you about.

1265
01:08:18,453 --> 01:08:19,810
Ha,

1266
01:08:20,693 --> 01:08:22,733
What I said last week,
I, I. I didn't

1267
01:08:22,986 --> 01:08:24,053
Mean.

1268
01:08:25,213 --> 01:08:27,666
I'm sorry, it's just---
Just growing up.

1269
01:08:27,786 --> 01:08:30,293
I know, I know the drill.
I've been doing this a long time.

1270
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,290
Maybe you were right.

1271
01:08:33,386 --> 01:08:34,733
Maybe too long.

1272
01:08:36,586 --> 01:08:39,000
So I've decided that I'm
gonna make a new documentary.

1273
01:08:39,706 --> 01:08:41,226
Yeah?
Mm hmm.

1274
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:42,680
What is the subject?

1275
01:08:45,946 --> 01:08:47,346
I just bailed him out.

1276
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:48,426
Shut up.

1277
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,120
Are you serious.

1278
01:08:53,253 --> 01:08:54,506
It's not how I taught you.

1279
01:08:54,973 --> 01:08:57,386
Like that, you got that?
You got that?

1280
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,706
You guys, I think you're looking at this all wrong.

1281
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,853
We, should be granted early acceptance
into every college in the country.

1282
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,506
I know Howard would welcome
me with open arms.

1283
01:09:06,613 --> 01:09:08,106
We're making a difference.

1284
01:09:08,333 --> 01:09:10,186
Will Howard welcome
me with open arms?

1285
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:11,693
And me?

1286
01:09:11,813 --> 01:09:13,080
Sure, you know?

1287
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,373
You could use a couple tokens.

1288
01:09:15,533 --> 01:09:16,653
May I chime in?

1289
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,533
Lawrence, your awake!

1290
01:09:20,213 --> 01:09:23,106
Baby, you look like a pig,
on a spit, but

1291
01:09:23,666 --> 01:09:25,100
I have never seen a prettier sight.

1292
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:27,100
Well, thanks, Walanda.

1293
01:09:27,733 --> 01:09:29,706
Can one of your doll me up,
like Meryl Streep dolled up

1294
01:09:29,706 --> 01:09:31,700
to Shirley MaClaine in "Postcards From The Edge"?

1295
01:09:31,906 --> 01:09:33,333
That's why I'm here, Darling.

1296
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:41,733
Ohh...
Now.

1297
01:09:42,213 --> 01:09:44,706
Enough of this whaling around like some
pregnant Heffer going into labor,

1298
01:09:44,706 --> 01:09:46,700
it's boring, and no one cares.

1299
01:09:47,306 --> 01:09:48,440
Now, isn't the time

1300
01:09:48,573 --> 01:09:49,533
to give up.

1301
01:09:49,693 --> 01:09:51,826
Now is the time, to fight this thing.

1302
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,853
Yes, we screwed up, big-time.

1303
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,986
Bigger than big time, biggest time.

1304
01:09:55,986 --> 01:09:57,980
Which is exactly why we
have to make it right.

1305
01:09:58,426 --> 01:10:00,933
And the election for State School Superintendent
is only two days way.

1306
01:10:01,106 --> 01:10:04,640
And we have to step up to the plate, inbound the ball,
and get a touchdown!

1307
01:10:05,173 --> 01:10:06,160
Yeah, he's right!

1308
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:08,306
Let's do this thing!
Just one other thing:

1309
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,520
Yeah?

1310
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:11,053
Was... prison hot?

1311
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:17,146
That's great, it starts with an earthquake,

1312
01:10:17,253 --> 01:10:19,250
Birds and snakes, an airplane.

1313
01:10:19,493 --> 01:10:23,013
And Lenny Bruce is not afraid.

1314
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:25,213
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn.

1315
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,720
World serves it's own needs,
don't misserve your own needs.

1316
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,760
Feed it up a knock, speed, grunt, no, strength.

1317
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,386
The ladder starts to clatter with
a fear of height, down, height.

1318
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:34,493
Wire in a fire, represent the seven games.

1319
01:10:34,493 --> 01:10:36,800
And the government for hiring and a combat site

1320
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,120
Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the furies,

1321
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,120
Breathing down your neck.

1322
01:10:41,653 --> 01:10:43,760
Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped.

1323
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,253
Look at that low plane, fine, then.

1324
01:10:46,386 --> 01:10:48,546
Uh-oh, overflow, population, common group.

1325
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,400
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself.

1326
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,120
World serves it's own needs, listen to your heart bleed Tell me--
So that's it.

1327
01:10:53,173 --> 01:10:55,013
with the Rapture and the reverent in the right---
The election is yours.

1328
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:59,426
right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched.
If polling is correct, you're our state's
next superintendent of schools.

1329
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:01,933
It's the end of the world!
Congratulations.

1330
01:11:01,933 --> 01:11:03,930
As we know it.

1331
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:08,360
It's the end of the world as we know it.

1332
01:11:08,546 --> 01:11:12,800
It's the end of the world as we know it.

1333
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,466
And I feel fine.

1334
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,253
Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce, and Lester Bangs.

1335
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:27,493
Birthday party, cheesecake, jellybean, boom
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck, right? Right.

1336
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:30,346
It's the end of the world.
You're sure you can do this?

1337
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:35,933
Watch me work.

1338
01:11:38,133 --> 01:11:41,133
Oh, tell that hot Tamale caption Rick Garcia,

1339
01:11:41,293 --> 01:11:43,826
if he wants some black beans
with his grande chicken burrito,

1340
01:11:44,146 --> 01:11:46,600
Mm, I'm his lady, OK?

1341
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,853
Yeah, you tell him girl.
That's right!

1342
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:51,640
Garcia, are you the caption,
or do you have a vagina?

1343
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:54,453
Yeah! A Vagina!
I'm the captain, Sir!

1344
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:56,840
Well, if your the captain,
you better play like you're the captain.

1345
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,440
And not some tampon-wearing señorita.

1346
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,960
Yeah, a tampon.

1347
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,253
I'm no tampon, Sir!
Than act

1348
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,573
like it, damn it!
Yeah, damn it.

1349
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,613
Um, Rick?

1350
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,746
May I please have a word?

1351
01:12:12,546 --> 01:12:14,160
Do you understand
what you're asking us to do?

1352
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,160
Throw the game?

1353
01:12:17,813 --> 01:12:19,346
Why would I possible agree to that?

1354
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,340
Let me ask you something:

1355
01:12:21,813 --> 01:12:25,240
Do you ever want to see the Olsen Twins,
up close in personal again?

1356
01:12:36,493 --> 01:12:40,613
Well, football van, the big game, at your Booker Boogers,

1357
01:12:40,613 --> 01:12:42,610
take out the Lincoln Lions.

1358
01:12:43,546 --> 01:12:45,213
Ben, too close.

1359
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,746
OK... Thank you

1360
01:12:49,093 --> 01:12:50,933
for coming, blah blah blah.

1361
01:12:51,253 --> 01:12:54,360
Don't forget to vote, unless of course,
you're not planning on voting for me...

1362
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:58,920
Holds for laughter and applause from the croud...
Hum it up, hum it up.

1363
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:23,946
Hi uh, my name is Charlotte Pratt,

1364
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:25,840
I'm a student at Booker High School.

1365
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,760
And we just want to urge you to vote against
Donna Weller at the upcoming election on Tuesday.

1366
01:13:30,893 --> 01:13:32,293
Thank you for your support, um.

1367
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:34,880
Oh, and be sure to turn on channel 64
if you have the chance.

1368
01:13:34,946 --> 01:13:37,066
Hi, my name is Kelly,
I'm a student at Booker High School.

1369
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:39,060
Hola!
My name is Dementia.

1370
01:13:39,173 --> 01:13:42,413
My name is Ashley, and I'm a student at
Booker High School. Seriously.

1371
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:43,453
Ew.

1372
01:13:48,813 --> 01:13:50,053
We're live!

1373
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:53,360
All my new people, we're live!

1374
01:13:54,786 --> 01:13:59,053
For your support in our effort to stop Donna Weller's
bid to become the State's School Superintendent,

1375
01:13:59,053 --> 01:14:01,050
we, the students of Booker High,

1376
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,600
Would like to take this opportunity,
to entertain.

1377
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:05,453
Thank you, Holden.

1378
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:07,586
And next, we have Mo Williams!

1379
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,786
Stella!

1380
01:14:15,853 --> 01:14:17,780
Stella!

1381
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,320
For my first extraordinary illusion,

1382
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:23,520
I will attempt,

1383
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,520
to levitate.

1384
01:14:30,733 --> 01:14:32,533
Next up, we got: Lora,

1385
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:35,053
and Amanda, juggling the fruit.

1386
01:14:38,133 --> 01:14:40,733
Have you ever seen a great toss between twins?

1387
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,730
Here they come, please welcome

1388
01:14:42,826 --> 01:14:44,146
Stephen and Kevin!

1389
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,140
Give them a hand!

1390
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:52,373
Next we have Chuck McGinn,

1391
01:14:52,426 --> 01:14:56,506
Doing a tribute to our dear endured comrade
Lorance Reitzer.

1392
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:01,000
He will be performing: Sunday, in the
public restroom, with

1393
01:15:01,226 --> 01:15:01,880
George.

1394
01:15:07,013 --> 01:15:09,613
It's a Sunday afternoon.

1395
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,040
I am a handsome fellow with nothing to do!

1396
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,800
It hurts, but it's not to take of.
Hey there's

1397
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,000
a public restroom.

1398
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:22,000
Will he like me?

1399
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:23,720
How will I know.

1400
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:26,820
There goes nothing,
it's starting to flow.

1401
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:29,820
It's just a game between two lost souls.

1402
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:33,600
I would love him to fill my soul.

1403
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,400
That's why we're here, I don't know.

1404
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,400
Fuck we play, the same game.

1405
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:44,000
I must be gotten dance of cock shore.

1406
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,520
Love!

1407
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,900
OK. Alright!

1408
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,440
Our final act is Walanda Jenkins.

1409
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,440
Singing: "Freedom Ain't free".

1410
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,640
And she is accompanied by Steve on guitar.

1411
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:08,640
Better be.

1412
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:14,560
Wonderful song.
Thanks.

1413
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:39,700
What the hell is going on here.
Find out about this, now!

1414
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,400
I'm a student at Booker High School.

1415
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,940
My name is Monica Rose.

1416
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:30,980
My name is Elizabeth Goings.

1417
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:34,020
I'm a student at Booker High, and I'm trying to---
Encourage you to vote against

1418
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:38,200
Donna Weller on Tuesday's election
for State Superintendent. She's like the worst

1419
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,920
Principal ever.

1420
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,480
Like totally---
No, seriously.

1421
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:44,500
I'd be happy to outline our specific
issues with Principal Weller if you'd like.

1422
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,660
Oh, I'm a cheerleader.

1423
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:47,560
She's totally against
the entire student union.

1424
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:51,160
This isn't the same, as when it was when you
were in school. We're dealing with some real issues here.

1425
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:55,580
Where do I live?
I'm actually head of the Celibacy Society.

1426
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,980
That's like, really gross.

1427
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:00,760
We're sick of her trying
to ruin our lives.

1428
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:03,280
Thanks for your support.
Great, thanks.

1429
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,880
Thanks for your support.
Thank you very much.

1430
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,760
Great, thanks.
And may the Lord be with you.

1431
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,260
This past week, students at Booker High School,

1432
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:18,500
Organized a massive campaign to challenge their Principal,
Donna Weller's bid for School Superintendent.

1433
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:22,240
As the polling reveals.

1434
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:27,700
Given the startling upset, one can make a case,
that apathy among teens has been greatly exaggerated.

1435
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:33,940
This is only the latest in a string of events.
Of civil disobedience that have caught the attention of the city.

1436
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:39,700
A wake-up call, against the alleged
overbearing policies of this school administration.

1437
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,300
All the kids in America,

1438
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:44,620
Listen up.

1439
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,680
This is a time to stand up and say: "shut up".

1440
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:50,200
To break the rules,
that were first intended for fools.

1441
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,900
What ever happened to:
"Living and letting live"?

1442
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:54,240
Is there nothing better to do
but screw our kids?

1443
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,320
Must be that we walk through our lives like blind sheep.

1444
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:59,600
'Cause I'm almost mama's daddy,
said: "Do it, it must be neat".

1445
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,840
Something smells funny,
whenever it's what's in need, rules change like it's nothing.

1446
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,020
It's bullshit, listen to this hypocrite,
it makes me sick. This is the world

1447
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:08,680
that I have to deal with?
I'm gonna live my life how I

1448
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,460
think I should. Call me bad
'cause I never ever felt so good.

1449
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,500
What people think, I could care less.

1450
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:19,980
'Cause only I know what is best.

1451
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:24,280
is: time to do what you want to.

1452
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:30,080
Don't listen, we'll make all you fools.

1453
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,880
And who was responsible?

1454
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,300
Actually, it was Lawrence
who came through for all of us.

1455
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:37,880
I just needed to get
a little butch, for a sec.

1456
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,880
My inspiration

1457
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,920
I pretended I was Bob Fosse, in all that jazz.

1458
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:46,120
And... try to get all rough and tumble
while wearing it

1459
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:48,520
And your Principal?
Lost the election.

1460
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,520
Quit her job.

1461
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,380
And we're all back at school.

1462
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:54,220
Felons, but luckily back at school.

1463
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:58,080
As well as some nice recommendations,
helped open up the doors to all the right colleges.

1464
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,840
What can we say?

1465
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,840
Couldn't have done it without you.

1466
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,940
My name is Linessa Riube.

1467
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:10,100
I'm 17 years old, I go to
Osceola High School is Kissimmee, Florida.

1468
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:15,360
My name is Nataley Leon,
I'm 16, I go to John Adams High School.

1469
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:20,480
I'm Rachel Guan,
I'm 15 years old, and last October

1470
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,880
I was expelled from school for a story I wrote.

1471
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,540
I wore this t-shirt to school
that said: "Boy was a lesbian".

1472
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:28,420
My math teacher saw my shirt.

1473
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:31,400
And he, he's laughing at it.
And he's like: "Is it appropriate?"

1474
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:38,680
I decided to take a bunch of condoms
and tape them onto my shirt. 5 days suspension.

1475
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,680
Go home!

1476
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,840
This story was about a girl who fell asleep in class.

1477
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,720
And dreamed she shot a math teacher.

1478
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:50,460
And then when she was running from
the building, she was shot by the school resource officer.

1479
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:57,700
We were having spirit weekend.
For one of the spirit days it was Halloween, so I was like: "Ohhh!".

1480
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:00,540
I have a lot of friend,
and we're all teenagers.

1481
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:05,240
We all know what we do. I'm not gonna lie.

1482
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:10,260
Some girl wore a shirt to school with like,
someone ripping a bat's head off,

1483
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:13,460
nobody say anything to her,
but they see the word "lesbian", everybody gets offended.

1484
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:15,460
I got suspended for it.

1485
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:22,480
The though of me getting in trouble
for writing something, never even crossed my mind.

1486
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:30,900
My Mom came to the school but, she wasn't so polite
about it. She came to school with news cameras.

1487
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:34,220
Fox, 5, there was all like, these reporters there.

1488
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:38,940
The next day, I came home from school,
and it was just swamped by media.

1489
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:40,940
It was crazy.

1490
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:47,180
Then everyone went crazy.
I got channel 13, The Orlando Sentinel.

1491
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,640
Sharon Osbourne called me.

1492
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,880
My parents were pretty mad, but not at me.
They were really mad at the school.

1493
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,680
My Mother ironed this shirt for me,
the morning that I wore it.

1494
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,440
So, my Mom's just 110%, she's behind me.

1495
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,560
"Venessa, why'd you do this?"

1496
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,120
Promoting safe sex! Why are you promoting safe sex?
'Cause my Mom has HIV!

1497
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:17,120
Hmm

1498
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,420
What happened to me was really wrong.

1499
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:25,580
And I shouldn't be punished for writing.
America is supposed to be a free country, and people should be

1500
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,960
allowed to express themselves.

1501
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,500
If you gay, you gay. You know?

1502
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,600
If you're straight, you're straight.
You just get on with your day of school.

1503
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,120
You wake up human, you go to sleep human.
We all the same. We, we all

1504
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,920
Same blood, you know?
We all... beat the same heart.

1505
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:43,840
My Mom has--- no, had HIV before she died.

1506
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,860
And, I refuse to let my friends
wield a way, to the same disease.

1507
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:51,820
I'm, sure there were a lot of other
little cases that

1508
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:53,820
popped up that were
similar to that, I know.

1509
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:58,280
Whenever we came home and checked
the answering machine, there were always people
telling us about things that happened to them.

1510
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:15,720
Hey, you, you look pretty big up there
on the big screen. Are you kidding me?

1511
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,040
With that giant zit in the middle of my forehead?
I didn't see your zit.

1512
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:23,220
How could you not see it, it was the size of a house.
I couldn't take my eyes off your smile.

1513
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,760
I've got two words for you,

1514
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,620
Dorky

1515
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:30,420
So, what's it like to kiss a movie star?

1516
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,220
I don't know, you tell me.

1517
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,880
There is actually one screen kiss I didn't tell you about.

1518
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,880
Oh, really? Yeah, watch, puddle.

1519
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:39,440
1941

1520
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:43,840
you're in the army now. Jane Wyman and Regis Toomey
shared the longest screen kiss in filming history.

1521
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:45,200
How long was it?

1522
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,580
I, don't think I should tell you.

1523
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:49,040
I don't think you'd handle it.

1524
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,040
Is that a challenge?

1525
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,060
What, how long was it?

1526
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,880
Three minutes, and five seconds.

1527
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,160
Are you ready?

1528
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:02,520
Ready for what?

1529
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,700
To rewrite a little bit of, film history.

1530
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:10,160
You wanna call it, or should I?
I'll do it.

1531
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:13,040
Action.

1532
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:24,780
Just in-case your not wearing a watch,
that's 3 minutes, and 10 seconds.

1533
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:26,780
A new record.

1534
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:30,220
And provided we don't sneeze,
or pass out from lack of oxygen,

1535
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,740
We'll make it just shy of 6 minutes.

1536
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,920
So did we change the world?

1537
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:37,460
If not,

1538
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,200
It's still early in the week.
