00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,516
(typing)

2
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,188
Still got it.

3
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,792
(* "Shotgun" by Junior Walker
and the Allstars)

4
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,039
* l said shotgun

5
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,070
* Shoot 'em 'fore they run now

6
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,995
* Do the jerk, baby

7
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,915
* Do the dirty now

8
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,836
* Put on your red dress

9
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,398
* And then you go downtown now

10
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,238
* l said buy yourself a shotgun now

11
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,033
* We're gonna break it down, baby, now

12
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,072
* We're gonna load it up, baby, now

13
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,156
* Oh, can you shoot 'em
'fore they run now

14
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,433
* l said shotgun

15
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,629
* Shoot 'em 'fore they run now

16
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,116
* Do the jerk, baby

17
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,910
* Do the dirty now

18
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,196
* Put on your high-heel shoes

19
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,635
* l said we're going down here
listen to 'em play the blues

20
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,558
* We're gonna dig potatoes

21
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,353
* We're gonna pick tomatoes

22
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,953
* l said shotgun

23
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,915
* Shoot 'em 'fore they run now

24
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,590
* Do the jerk, baby

25
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,430
* Do the dirty now

26
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,510
* l said it's twine time...

27
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,313
(revs engine)

28
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,597
(woman) What's that?

29
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,915
An old friend.

30
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,034
l was rummaging through a closet
and it was just sitting there.

31
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,630
lt's nice, Paul. lt's got character.

32
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,149
When l wrote my first book
l carried it in this...

33
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,271
..while l was looking for a publisher.

34
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,312
- l was a writer then.
- You're still a writer.

35
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,114
Haven't been a writer
since l got in the Misery business.

36
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,358
lt's not a bad business.
And it would still be growing, too.

37
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,431
The first printing for Misery's Child
was the most ever. Over a million.

38
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,312
Marcia, please.

39
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,115
Misery Chastain is putting
your daughter through college,...

40
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,515
..bought you two houses
and seats to the Knicks.

41
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,029
What thanks does she get?
You go and kill her!

42
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,478
l never meant for it to become my life.

43
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,559
lf l hadn't gotten rid of her now,
l'd have ended up writing her for ever.

44
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,674
Now l'm leaving for Colorado
to try to finish the new book.

45
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,033
lf l can make this work... l might just
have something l want on my tombstone.

46
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,630
(thud)

47
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,949
(groans)

48
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,873
(distorted woman's voice)
l'm your number one fan.

49
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,673
There's nothing to worry about.

50
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,032
You're gonna bejust fine.
l'll take good care ofyou.

51
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,548
l'm your number one fan.

52
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,994
Where...

53
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,351
We're just outside Silver Creek.

54
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,713
How long?

55
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,389
You've been here two days.
You're gonna be OK.

56
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,389
- My name is Annie Wilkes.
- My number one fan.

57
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,556
Yes. That's right. l'm also a nurse.

58
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,230
Here, take these.

59
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,872
Here.

60
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,629
- What are they?
- They're called Novril. For your pain.

61
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,996
Thank you.

62
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,830
How come l'm not in the hospital?

63
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,350
The blizzard was too strong.
l couldn't risk trying to get you there.

64
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,994
l tried calling,
but the phone lines are down.

65
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,799
l... Agh...

66
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,435
You mustn't tire yourself.
You've gotta rest.

67
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,835
You almost died.

68
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,436
Open wide.

69
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,831
(groans)

70
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,473
Your legs just sing grand opera
when you move, don't they?

71
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,433
lt's not gonna hurt for ever, Paul,
l promise you.

72
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,593
- Will l be able to walk?
- Of course you will.

73
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,075
And your arm will be fine, too.

74
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,236
Your shoulder was badly dislocated.

75
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,477
lt was a little stubborn,
but l finally popped it back in.

76
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,353
What l'm most proud of
is the work l did on those legs.

77
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,157
Considering what l had in the house,
l don't think a doctor could've done better.

78
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,915
lt's not nearly as bad as it looks.

79
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,952
You have a compound fracture
of the tibia in both legs.

80
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,992
The fibula in the right leg
is fractured, too.

81
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,193
l could hear the bones moving, so it's best
for your legs to remain immobile.

82
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,599
And as soon as the roads open,
l'll take you to a hospital.

83
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,518
Meantime, you've got
a lot of recovering to do,...

84
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,553
..and l consider it an honour
that you'll do it in my home.

85
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,320
This is Marcia Sindell,
calling from New York City.

86
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,352
l'd like to speak to the Silver Creek
chief of police or sheriff.

87
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,948
- Which one do you want?
- Whichever one's not busy.

88
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,551
Well, l'm pretty sure they're both not
busy, Miz Sindell, since they're both me.

89
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,117
l also happen to be president of
the Policeman's Benefit Association,...

90
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,629
..chairman of the Patrolman's
Retirement Fund,...

91
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,196
..and if you need a good fishing guide
you could do a lot worse.

92
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,550
Call me Buster. Everybody does.

93
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,398
What can l do for ya?

94
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,990
l'm a literary agent and l...
l feel like a fool calling you,...

95
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,513
..but l think one of my clients, Paul
Sheldon, may be in some kind of trouble.

96
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,794
- You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
- Uh-huh.

97
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,195
- He's your client, huh?
- Yes, he is.

98
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,959
Well, everybody sure likes
those Misery books.

99
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,355
Yeah.

100
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,110
Paul's been coming to the Silver Creek
Lodge for years to finish his books.

101
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,913
l understand he's been up here
the last six weeks.

102
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,350
Well, not quite. l just called there.

103
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,600
They said he checked out last Tuesday.
lsn't that a little strange?

104
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,679
l don't know. Does he usually phone you
before he checks out of a hotel?

105
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,473
No. No, of course not. lt's just
that his daughter hasn't heard from him...

106
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,229
..and when he has a new book
coming out he usually keeps in touch.

107
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,035
So when there wasn't
any word from him...

108
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,151
You think he might be missing, huh?

109
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,957
(sighs) l hate that l made this call.
Tell me l'm being silly.

110
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,434
Oh, a little overprotective maybe, but...
Tell you what l'll do.

111
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,669
Nothing's been reported out here,
but l'll put his name through our system.

112
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,313
lf anything turns up,
l'll call you right back.

113
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,670
l appreciate that. Thanks a lot.

114
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,950
Goodbye, Miz Sindell.

115
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,554
We got a phone call? Busy morning.

116
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,035
Yeah. Work, work, work.

117
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,830
Virginia, when was that blizzard?

118
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,200
Last Tuesday. Why?

119
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,036
No reason.

120
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,994
l guess it was kind of a miracle
you finding me.

121
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,519
(chuckles)

122
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,995
No, it wasn't a miracle at all.

123
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,076
- ln a way, l was following you.
- You were following me?

124
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,237
Well, it was no secret to me
you were staying at the Silver Creek,...

125
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,636
..seeing as how
l'm your number one fan an' all.

126
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,638
Some nights l'd just tool on
down there and sit outside...

127
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,797
..and look up at the light in your cabin.

128
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,799
l'd try to imagine what was going on
in the room of the world's greatest writer.

129
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,957
- Say that again, l didn't hear you.
- Don't move now.

130
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,514
l wouldn't wanna hurt this neck.

131
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,638
Well, the other afternoon
l was on my way home...

132
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,399
..and there you were, leaving the lodge.

133
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,071
l wondered why a literary genius would
go for a drive with a big storm coming.

134
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,760
l didn't know there
was a big storm coming.

135
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,634
Well, lucky for you l did.
Lucky for me, too,...

136
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,116
..cos now you're alive
and you can write more books.

137
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,389
Oh, Paul, l've read everything of yours.

138
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,080
The Misery novels -
l know 'em all by heart.

139
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,476
All eight of 'em. l love them so.

140
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,434
- Well, you're very kind.
- And you're very brilliant.

141
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,994
Like a baby. All done.

142
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,238
Thank you.

143
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,716
When do you think the phone lines'll
be up? l have to call my daughter,...

144
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,116
..and l'd like to call my agent
and let her know l'm still breathing.

145
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,037
lt shouldn't be much longer.

146
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,197
Once the roads are open,
the phone lines'll be up in no time.

147
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,550
lf you give me their numbers
l'll keep trying.

148
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,636
Thank you.

149
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,030
Could l ask you a favour?

150
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,352
l noticed in your case
there's a new Paul Sheldon book.

151
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,436
l wondered if maybe...

152
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,514
- You want to read it?
- Well, if you wouldn't mind.

153
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,352
l do have a hard-and-fast rule as to
who reads my stuff at this early stage.

154
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,156
Only my editor, my agent,...

155
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,716
..and anybody that saves me
from freezing to death in a car wreck.

156
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,629
You'll never realise
what a rare treat you've given me.

157
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,478
(groans)

158
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,589
Boy, it's like clockwork
the way your pain comes.

159
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,635
l'll get the Novril. Forgive me for prattling
away and making you feel all oogy.

160
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,389
What's your new book called?

161
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,670
l don't have a title yet.

162
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,791
What's it about?

163
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,117
l don't know.

164
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,109
l know it sounds crazy, but l haven't
written anything but Misery for so long...

165
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,711
Why don't you read it? You can
tell me what you think it's about.

166
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,798
Maybe you can come up with a title.

167
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,036
Like l could do that!

168
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,956
(man) There's nothing unusual
about Mr Sheldon's leaving, Buster.

169
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,152
- You can tell by the champagne.
- Maybe you can, Libby.

170
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,989
See, he always orders a bottle
of Dom Pérignon when he's ready to go.

171
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,076
Then he pays up and he's out the door.

172
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,432
No long-distance phone calls
or Federal Express packages?

173
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,755
Anything out of the ordinary?

174
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,159
l don't think Mr Sheldon likes
for things to be out of the ordinary.

175
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:53,196
Considering who he is, famous an' all,
he doesn't put on airs.

176
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,348
Drives up from New York
in the same car each time, '65 Mustang.

177
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,835
He says it helps him to think.

178
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,917
He's always been a good guest. Never
makes a noise, never bothers a soul.

179
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,871
- l sure hope nothing's happened to him.
- So do l.

180
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,558
l bet that old Mustang's
pulling into New York right now.

181
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,989
l'm sure you're right. Thanks, Libby.

182
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,997
My pleasure.

183
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,229
l know l'm only 40 pages
into your book, but...

184
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,036
But what?

185
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,470
- Nothing.
- No, no... What is it?

186
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,037
Well, it's ridiculous. Who am l
to make a criticism to someone like you?

187
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,310
lt's all right, l can take it.

188
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,073
Well, it's brilliantly written...
But then everything you write is brilliant.

189
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,111
Pretty rough so far.

190
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,757
The swearing, Paul.

191
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,472
There, l said it.

192
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,879
The, uh... the profanity bothers you?

193
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,435
lt has no nobility.

194
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:19,192
These are slum kids. l was a slum kid.
Everybody talks like that.

195
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,632
They do not! What do you think l say
when l go to the feed store in town?

196
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,790
"Wally, give me a bag of that effing pig
feed and 10lb of that bitchly cow corn!"

197
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,232
And in the bank do l tell Mrs Bollinger
"Here's one big bastard of a cheque,...

198
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,351
..give me some Christing money!"

199
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,916
There! Look there!
See what you made me do?

200
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,435
Oh, Paul, l'm sorry.

201
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,036
l'm so sorry.

202
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,992
Oh...

203
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,236
Sometimes l get so worked up.
Can you ever forgive me?

204
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,396
lt's... fine.

205
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,756
l love you, Paul.

206
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,750
Your mind. Your creativity.
That's all l meant.

207
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,555
Well, this sure is fun.

208
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,794
Virginia, when you're in this car
you're not my wife, you're my deputy.

209
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,597
Well, this deputy'd rather be home
under the covers with the sheriff.

210
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,393
- Stop. Stop!
- What?

211
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,951
- See that broken limb?
- Could've been the weight of the snow.

212
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,915
Yeah. Could've been a rotten branch,
the wind, could've been a lot of things.

213
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,511
Oh...

214
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,119
Damn!

215
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,711
Need some help?

216
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,710
No, l'm enjoying myself! Thank you.

217
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,274
- You really think Sheldon's out there?
- l hope not. lf he is, he's dead.

218
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,668
Let's go to the newspaper office.

219
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,229
Oh, l hope l didn't wake you.

220
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,151
No, that's fine.

221
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,914
Look what l got. They had it at the store,
Paul. There was a whole batch of 'em.

222
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,079
As soon as l saw it l slammed
my money down - l got the first copy.

223
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,829
- Then the roads are open.
- The one to town is, but that's about it.

224
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,589
l called the hospital and talked
to the head orthopaedic surgeon...

225
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,712
..and l told him who you were
and what had happened.

226
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,391
He said as long as there's no infection
you're not in any danger.

227
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,957
As soon as the road to the hospital is
open they'll send an ambulance for you.

228
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,389
The phones are working?

229
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,358
Well, mine's still out, but the ones in town
were working fine. l called your agent.

230
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,315
Oh, Paul, l peeked at the very beginning.
What a wonderful first page.

231
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,512
- Just to read the name Misery Chastain...
- My daughter will be going nuts.

232
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,589
- lt's like a visit from my dearest friend.
- l should be home for her birthday today.

233
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,196
The agent said she'd tell her you're OK,...

234
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,757
..but you'll have to wait till tomorrow
to talk to her yourself.

235
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,914
Oh, Paul... What a poet you are.

236
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,833
l made you my specialty,
scrambled eggs à la Wilkes.

237
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,470
And l'm on page 75.

238
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,634
l guess that means it's OK.

239
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,308
No.

240
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,355
No, it isn't, it's...

241
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,554
Oh, pooh, l can't think of any words.
Would "great" be insulting?

242
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,916
l can live with great.

243
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,079
No... lt's not just great, it's...

244
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,109
..perfect.

245
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,515
A perfect, perfect thing.

246
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,716
(grunting)

247
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,518
l thought it was time
you two should meet.

248
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,120
Paul, say hello to my favourite beast
in the whole world - my sow Misery.

249
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,595
Misery?

250
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,280
Yes. l told you l was your number one fan.

251
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,479
Yeah, l'm, uh... starting to believe you.

252
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,435
This farm was kind of dreary, what with
just a few cows and chickens and me.

253
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,998
But when l got Misery here everything
changed. She just makes me smile so.

254
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,795
She's a fine, uh... pig, is what she is.

255
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,988
l'm on page 300 now, Paul,...

256
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,430
..and it's better than perfect. lt's divine.

257
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,755
What's the ceiling that dago painted?

258
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,111
- The Sistine Chapel.
- Yeah! That and Misery's Child,...

259
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,153
..those are the only two divine
things ever in this world!

260
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,840
(snorts)

261
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,790
When my husband left me,
l wasn't prepared.

262
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,670
lt wasn't an easy time.

263
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,078
For a while l thought l might go crazy.

264
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,230
Yeah, l know how that can be.

265
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,195
l don't know about you, but what l did
to get through it was l dove into work.

266
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,069
Days, nights...

267
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,235
Night shifts can be lonely
at a hospital. l did a lot of reading.

268
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,713
That was when l first discovered Misery.

269
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,229
She made me so happy.
She made me forget all my problems.

270
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,270
Course, l suppose you had
a little something to do with that, too.

271
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,356
Yeah, well...

272
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,759
l just kept reading them over and over.

273
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,191
l've got two chapters to go on this one...

274
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,758
..and when l finish l'll turn right to the first
page and start reading it all over again.

275
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,316
l'm, uh...

276
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,798
- Done?
- Yeah.

277
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,876
No problem.

278
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,599
Thanks.

279
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,917
Don't get me wrong.
l'm not against marriage per se,...

280
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,716
..but it'd take a pretty special guy to make
me wanna walk down that aisle again.

281
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,510
Yeah, it's, uh, not something
you should enter into lightly.

282
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,790
lt boils down to respect.

283
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,071
People just don't respect
the institution of marriage any more.

284
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,431
They have no sense of real commitment.

285
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,435
Well, l'd love to stay here and chat,...

286
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,269
..but l'm right at the end
and l gotta find out what happens.

287
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,150
(door opens and closes)

288
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,516
You...

289
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,557
You dirty bird... How could you?

290
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,238
She can't be dead!
Misery Chastain cannot be dead!

291
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,189
Annie, in 1871
women often died in childbirth.

292
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,990
Her spirit is the important thing.
Misery's spirit is still alive.

293
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,590
l don't want her spirit! l want her!

294
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,756
And you murdered her!

295
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,235
No... l didn't.

296
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,873
Who did?

297
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,675
No one. She... she died,
she just slipped away.

298
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,873
Slipped away? Slipped away?

299
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,639
She didn't just slip away! You did it!

300
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,710
You did it! You did it!

301
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,628
You did it! You did it!
You murdered my Misery!

302
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,954
Annie...

303
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,148
l thought you were good, Paul.

304
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:18,035
But you're not good.
You're just another lying old dirty birdie.

305
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,948
And l don't think l better
be around you for a while.

306
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,718
And don't even think
about anybody coming for you.

307
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:39,678
Not the doctors, not your agent, not
your family, because l never called them.

308
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,030
Nobody knows you're here.

309
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,993
And you better hope
nothing happens to me.

310
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,032
Because if l die... you die.

311
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,116
(door closes)

312
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,795
(another door closes)

313
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,035
(engine starts)

314
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,038
Agh!

315
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,273
No, Miz Sindell, there's no point
in coming up here now.

316
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,868
Everything that can be done is.

317
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,550
Yes, we're working close with the state
police and the FBl's been informed.

318
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,310
Right. Right. As soon as we know
anything, we'll let you know.

319
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,918
No bother at all. Call any time.
Bye, Miz Sindell.

320
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,316
All right. Well, l sure
appreciate it. Thank you.

321
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,554
According to Sheldon's credit charges,
there's nothing after the Silver Creek.

322
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,274
And no calls about the article, either.

323
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,274
You poor, dear thing.
What are you doing on the floor?

324
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,836
lt's all my fault.

325
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,509
lf l'd had a proper hospital bed
this never would've happened.

326
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,358
Here, let me help you back in.

327
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,436
(Paul groans)

328
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,793
l know this hurts,
but it'll only take a few seconds.

329
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,755
Upsy-daisy!

330
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,196
Oh... Ow...

331
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,629
- Oh, please, wait, wait...
- Oh, you're such a crybaby.

332
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,234
Agh...

333
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,840
There you go. Comfy?

334
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,432
- Perfect.
- You're such a kidder.

335
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,236
l have a big surprise for you.
But first there's something you must do.

336
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,436
You don't suppose l could have a little
snack while l'm waiting for the surprise?

337
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,519
l'll get you everything you want,
but you must listen first.

338
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,110
Sometimes my thinking
is a little muddy, l accept that.

339
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,679
lt's why l couldn't remember all they
asked me on the witness stand in Denver.

340
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,870
But this time l thought clearly.

341
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,558
l asked God about you,...

342
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,753
..and God said "l delivered him unto you
so that you may show him the way."

343
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,432
- Show me the way?
- Yes.

344
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,598
When l mentioned a snack, l was thinking
more on the lines of cheese and crackers.

345
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,792
Paul, this is no time for jokes.

346
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,388
You must rid the world of this filth.

347
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,791
You want me to burn my book?

348
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,999
l know this may be difficult for you,
but it's for the best.

349
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,275
lt's really not difficult at all.

350
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,349
My agent made dozens of copies.
There's gonna be an auction in New York.

351
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,994
Every publishing house in New York
is reading it now.

352
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:19,558
So if you want me to burn my book, fine.
You're not ridding the world of anything.

353
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,836
Then light the match, Paul.

354
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,231
lt's no big deal.

355
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,796
So you've indicated. Do it.

356
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,839
l know it's the only copy. When you wrote
your first book you didn't make a copy...

357
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,997
..because you didn't think anybody
would take it seriously.

358
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,953
Now you never make copies
because you're superstitious.

359
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,275
lt's why you always
come back to Silver Creek.

360
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,393
You told that story to Merv Griffin
1 1 years ago.

361
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,310
Merv Griffin...

362
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,391
l'll tell you what. lt doesn't ever have to be
published. No one ever has to read it.

363
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,513
l'll just keep it for myself.
No one will even know it exists.

364
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,353
As long as it does exist,
your mind won't ever be free.

365
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,834
l think you should light the match, Paul.

366
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,789
Can't you see it's what God wants?

367
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,359
You're so brilliant l would think
you'd certainly be able to see that.

368
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,591
We're put on this earth
to help people, Paul.

369
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,393
Like l'm trying to help you.

370
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,274
Please... help me help you.

371
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,990
You're doing the right thing.

372
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,752
Oh, my goodness!
Goodness gracious! Oh, my...

373
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,429
Oh, goodness! Heavens to Betsy!

374
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,918
Oh, goodness! Oh, my goodness!

375
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,631
Heavens to Betsy! Oh, goodness!

376
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,520
Well, isn't that an oogy mess?

377
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,957
(helicopter)

378
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,788
That's the Steadman place down there.

379
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,159
And that's the Wilkes farm straight ahead.

380
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,309
That's no '65 Mustang.

381
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,470
There's nothing else out this way.
Let's circle back.

382
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,435
l do believe the winters are getting
shorter and shorter every year.

383
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:54,429
People say it has something to do
with the ozone layer. What do you think?

384
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,512
l don't know.

385
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,435
Yeah, well, it's a theory.

386
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,316
Here's your Novril.

387
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,957
We're back. Now, you'll have
to remind us who the audience chose.

388
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,911
They chose Kevin.

389
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,156
Congratulations, Kevin Andrews!

390
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,271
- Hi, Kevin.
- How you doing, Chuck?

391
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,279
Make yourselfat home back there,
and Sheree will tell us about the date.

392
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,075
OK, first ofall l picked out
a very classy restaurant.

393
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,318
lt was so classy,
and he shows up without no tie...

394
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,597
See, isn't this nice?

395
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,076
Great. l always wanted to visit
the other side of the room.

396
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,668
Ooh, and look what l got for you.

397
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,795
An electric razor,
so you can shave yourself now.

398
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,276
(razor buzzes)

399
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,518
lf l knew this was the surprise
l'd have burned all my books.

400
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,154
Now, don't poke fun!

401
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:33,195
This is a very big day for you, Paul. You
just sit tight and l'll set everything up.

402
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,152
- Set what up?
- That's the big surprise.

403
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,637
Your new studio.

404
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,797
After all, writers do need a place to work.

405
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,434
Work? You mean write?

406
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,470
What in the world do you think l'd write?

407
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,990
Oh, but, Paul, l don't think. l know.

408
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,949
Now you've gotten rid
of that manuscript,...

409
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,833
..you can go back
to doing what you're great at.

410
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,509
You're gonna write a new novel,
your greatest achievement ever.

411
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,949
Misery's Return.

412
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,396
Misery's Return?

413
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,196
l know you didn't mean it when you killed
her, and now you'll make it right.

414
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,754
lt'll be a book in my honour, for saving
your life and nursing you back to health.

415
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,518
Oh, Paul, you're gonna make me
the envy of the whole world!

416
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,599
You just expect me to whip
something off, is that it?

417
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,037
l expect nothing less
than your masterpiece.

418
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,795
You do understand that this is not the
ordinary way in which books get written.

419
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,515
l mean, some people might actually
consider this an oddball situation.

420
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,839
l have total confidence in your brilliance.
Besides, the view will inspire you.

421
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,679
You just inhale that. l'll be right back.

422
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,590
l guess you don't get bothered
by neighbours much.

423
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,874
Don't worry, you'll have total solitude
so you can concentrate on your work.

424
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,877
Great.

425
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,638
l got you this expensive
paper to type on,...

426
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,912
..and l got a great deal on this 50lb
clunker on account of it's missing an N.

427
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,033
l told the saleslady N was one of the
letters in my favourite writer's name.

428
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,829
lt's two of the letters
in my favourite nurse's name, A-nn-ie.

429
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,748
You fooler! Did l do good?

430
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,996
You did great.

431
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,359
There is just one little thing. Uh...

432
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,351
l can't work on this paper. See,
it's Corrasable Bond. lt smudges.

433
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,430
So l thought maybe,
if you went back into town,...

434
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,075
..you could bring me
some white long-grain mimeo.

435
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,239
But mine cost the most,
so l don't see how it can smudge.

436
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,475
Come here, l'll show you.

437
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:27,637
Oh... lt does smudge after all.
lsn't that fascinating.

438
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,955
l thought you'd be interested.

439
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,514
l'd like for you to be
in on everything, Annie,...

440
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,269
..not just the finished book,
but how it's written.

441
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,310
Thank you for thinking of me.

442
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,749
Anything else l can get while l'm in town?

443
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,278
Any other crucial requirements
that need satisfying?

444
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,436
Would you like a tiny tape recorder?

445
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,553
Or how about a handmade set
of writing slippers?

446
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,319
No, just the paper will be fine.

447
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,989
Are you sure? Cos if you want
l'll bring back the whole store for you.

448
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,992
Annie, uh, what's the matter?

449
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,429
l'll tell you what's the matter!

450
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,870
l go out of my way for you! l do
everything to try and make you happy!

451
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,629
l feed you, l clean you, l dress you,
and what thanks do l get?

452
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,150
"Oh, you bought the wrong paper, Annie.
l can't write on this, Annie!"

453
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,840
Well, l'll get your stupid paper,
but you better show me...

454
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,428
..a little more appreciation, Mister Man!

455
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,911
Agh!

456
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,876
(locks door)

457
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,792
Shit.

458
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,592
Come on...

459
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,233
Come on, you've written
about this, now do it.

460
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,157
(click)

461
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,038
What do you know? lt actually works.

462
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,316
What a surprise.

463
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,795
You crazy bitch.

464
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,798
Agh!

465
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,510
(car approaches)

466
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,959
(click)

467
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,029
Paul, l've got your paper.

468
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,439
l hope it's enough.
lt's three reams of long-grain mimeo.

469
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,915
Just the kind you asked for.

470
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,469
Paul! You're dripping with perspiration.

471
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,398
Your colour is very hectic.
What have you been doing?

472
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:12,317
You know damn well what l've been
doing. l've been sitting here suffering.

473
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,635
l need my pills.

474
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,389
Poor dear. Let's get you back in bed
and l'll get them for you.

475
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,033
l want my pills now!

476
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,720
- lt'll only take a second.
- No!

477
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,478
l want my pain to go away, Annie.

478
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,313
Please, make it go away.

479
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,675
Please, Annie.

480
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,872
Please.

481
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,473
lt just breaks my heart to see you like this.

482
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,909
l've done a lot of thinking
on the drive... Here you go.

483
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,473
And l'm absolutely certain the main
reason l've never been more popular...

484
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,636
..is because of my temper.

485
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,389
You must be so mad at me.
The truth now.

486
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,152
Well... Who doesn't let off
a little steam every once in a while?

487
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,553
My genius needs his rest before he writes.

488
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,476
(hums)

489
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,796
Footsies up.

490
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,590
There you go.

491
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,519
Here. ln case you think of any ideas.

492
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,830
Well, l wouldn't expect too much.

493
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,799
Don't be silly! You'll be brilliant.
Think of me as your inspiration.

494
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,749
l have faith in you, my darling.

495
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,799
Catch this...

496
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,316
My darling.

497
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,358
The presumption must now be
that Paul Sheldon is dead.

498
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,438
We know he somehow managed
to crawl outside his vehicle,...

499
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,633
..but we have been unable to find his body
in the vicinity of the accident.

500
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,912
We also know if anyone had found him
they'd have taken him to an area hospital.

501
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,476
Undoubtedly he is buried
somewhere out there in the snow.

502
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,556
We'll find him after the first thaw.

503
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,390
That is, unless the animals got to him
first, which is a distinct possibility.

504
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,594
That was a statement from Colorado
Police Chief Sherman Douglas.

505
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,150
You don't think he's dead, do you?

506
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,636
Well, he might well be,
but not the way they say.

507
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,320
He never crawled out
of that car by himself.

508
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,829
You can see the dents on the door there.

509
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,837
Someone pulled him out.

510
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,915
l'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong.

511
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,589
- What?
- You'll have to do it over again.

512
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,270
lt's not worthy of you. Throw it all out.

513
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,871
Except for naming the gravedigger
after me - you can leave that in.

514
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,477
l really value your criticism,
but maybe we're being a little hasty here.

515
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,875
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.

516
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,196
- Not fair?
- That's right.

517
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,198
When l was growing up in Bakersfield
my favourite thing...

518
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,198
..was to go to the movies on Saturdays
for the chapter plays.

519
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,153
- Cliffhangers.
- l know that, Mister Man!

520
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,795
They also call them serials.
l'm not stupid, you know!

521
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,719
Anyway, my favourite was Rocket Man,
and once it was a no-brakes chapter.

522
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:09,355
The bad guys stuck him in a car
on a mountain road, knocked him out,...

523
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,710
..tore out the brakes
and started him to his death.

524
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,400
And he woke up and tried to get out,...

525
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:17,956
..but the car went off a cliff before he
could escape, and crashed and burned,...

526
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,959
..and l was so upset and excited!
And the next week l was first in line.

527
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,150
They start with the end of the last week,...

528
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:28,034
..and there was Rocket Man trying
to get out, and here comes the cliff,...

529
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:33,234
..and just before the car went off the cliff
he jumped free, and all the kids cheered!

530
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,230
But l didn't cheer.
l stood right up and started shouting...

531
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:41,035
.."This isn't what happened last week!
Have you all got amnesia?"

532
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:48,316
"They just cheated us! This isn't fair!
He didn't get out of the cockadoodie car!"

533
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,438
They always cheated like that
in cl... chapter plays.

534
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:01,633
But not you. Not with my Misery.

535
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,117
lan did ride for Dr Cleary at the end
of the last book, but his horse fell...

536
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,676
..and lan broke his shoulder and ribs
and never reached the doctor,...

537
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:14,078
..so there couldn't be any experimental
blood transfusion that saved her life.

538
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:19,228
Misery was buried in the ground at the
end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.

539
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,198
ls it fair? Should l continue?

540
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,952
You better!

541
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:07,517
Oh, Paul! When lan realised that
the reason they'd buried Misery alive...

542
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,234
..was because the bee sting
had put her in that coma!

543
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,318
And Gravedigger Wilkes
remembered how 30 years earlier...

544
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,829
..the same had happened
to Lady Evelyn-Hyde!

545
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:20,397
And then Dr Cleary deduced that Misery
must be her long-lost daughter...

546
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:24,035
..because of the rarity of deadly
bee stings, my heart just leapt!

547
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,311
l knew from the very first book
that Misery had to be nobility...

548
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,749
- ..and l was right!
- Yeah.

549
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,635
Oh, Paul, can l read each chapter when
you're finished? l can fill in the N's.

550
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,639
Will she be her old self now lan has
dug her out, or will she have amnesia?

551
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,875
Have to wait.

552
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,833
Will she still love him
with that special, perfect love?

553
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,679
- You'll have to wait.
- Not even a hint?

554
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,710
Mm-mm.

555
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,034
Ohhh!

556
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,551
Misery's alive, Misery's alive!
Oh, it's so romantic!

557
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,672
Oh, this whole house
is gonna be filled with romance!

558
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,030
l'm gonna put on my Liberace records!

559
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,628
You do like Liberace, don't you?

560
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,715
Whenever he played Radio City,
who do you think was in the front row?

561
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:13,550
l'm gonna play my records all day long,
to inspire you. He's my all-time favourite.

562
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,272
Annie?

563
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,311
Would you have dinner with me tonight?
To celebrate Misery's Return.

564
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,634
l couldn't have done it without you.

565
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,476
Oh, Paul...

566
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,069
lt would be an honour.

567
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,311
No, he's not here.

568
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,512
l don't know where he is.
He never tells me anything any more.

569
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,677
He's probably out
having an affair somewhere.

570
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,030
Wait a minute. He's coming in now.

571
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,553
lt's Jim Taylor. He wants to know
who you're having an affair with.

572
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,510
Hello, Jim. What's doing?

573
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,154
Jim, we've been through this before.

574
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,669
lf you have benches
in front of your store,...

575
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,473
..people are gonna want to sit on 'em.

576
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:15,229
Well, l don't like him either, but l'm not
gonna come over and tell him to move.

577
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,954
Give my best to Denise. Bye.

578
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,430
Well, whoever she is,
she sure likes to read a lot.

579
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:27,950
Virginia, l'm flattered that
you think l've got that much energy.

580
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,789
l figured that if l can't find Paul Sheldon,...

581
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,832
..at least l can find out
what he wrote about.

582
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:40,717
What d'you expect to find? A story about
a guy who drove off a cliff in a storm?

583
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:47,353
You see, it's just that kind of sarcasm
that's given our marriage real spice.

584
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,475
(Liberace) * l'll be seeing you

585
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:58,513
* ln all the old familiar places...

586
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:04,159
- l hope you like it.
- lt looks wonderful.

587
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,236
So do you.

588
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,589
Mm...

589
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,518
l've never had meatloaf this good.
What do you do to it?

590
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,837
My secret is l only use
fresh tomatoes, never canned.

591
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,635
And to give it that extra zip l mix in
some Spam with the ground beef.

592
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,239
Ah...

593
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,158
Can't get this in a restaurant in New York.

594
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,435
- Let's have a toast.
- A toast?

595
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:03,109
Yes. To, um... to Misery.
Let me pour you some wine.

596
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,593
Oh...

597
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,035
Whoa...

598
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,718
No...

599
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,676
To Misery.

600
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:29,599
Wait. Let's do this right.
Do you have any candles?

601
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,078
Oh, um...

602
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,237
l don't know. l... l think so.

603
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,636
l'll go look.

604
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,352
Did you study decorating
or do you just have a flair?

605
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:52,793
Oh, you!
l just picked things up over the years.

606
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,390
Well, it certainly says you.

607
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:59,274
- You really think so?
- Oh, absolutely.

608
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,755
Listen, if you can't find any, it's OK.
l just thought it'd be nice.

609
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,473
Are you kidding? lf anyone
had ever told me that one day...

610
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,309
..l'd be having a candlelit dinner
with Paul Sheldon in my own house,...

611
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,752
..l woulda checked both legs
to see which one was being pulled!

612
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,958
Will this do?

613
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,196
lt's perfect.

614
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:30,960
To Misery... and to Annie Wilkes,
who brought her back to life.

615
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:34,675
Oh, Paul! l get goose bumps
every time l think about it!

616
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,952
Oh...

617
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,149
Oh, my God, what have l done?
Oh, l'm so sorry, Paul!

618
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,192
l ruined your beautiful toast!

619
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:48,351
Will you ever forgive me?

620
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,229
Here, let me pour another one.

621
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,793
Can we pretend this never happened?

622
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,032
To Misery.

623
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,556
To Misery.

624
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,270

Here's your pills.

Annie?

631
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,913
Annie, what is it?

632
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,036
The rain.

633
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:16,198
Sometimes it gives me the blues.

634
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:24,352
When you first came here... l only loved
the writer part of Paul Sheldon.

635
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:29,513
But now l know l love the rest of him, too.

636
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,990
l know you don't love me.

637
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,036
Don't say you do.

638
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:46,432
You're a beautiful, brilliant,
famous man of the world...

639
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,475
..and l'm... not a movie-star type.

640
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,912
You'll never know the fear
of losing someone like you...

641
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,429
..if you're someone like me.

642
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,469
Why would you lose me?

643
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,955
The book's almost finished.

644
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,474
Your legs are getting better.

645
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,959
Soon you'll be wanting to leave.

646
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:23,716
Why would l leave? l like it here.

647
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:29,912
That's very kind of you,
but l'll bet it's not altogether true.

648
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,156
l have this gun.

649
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,468
Sometimes l think about using it.

650
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,790
l better go now.

651
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,435
l might put bullets in it.

652
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:58,559
"There is a justice higher than
that of man. l will be judged by him."

653
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,749
What?

654
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,314
They're hauling Misery into court.

655
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,316
That's nice.

656
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:16,832
There is a justice...
higher than that of man.

657
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:22,677
l will be judged... by him.

01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,636
(rain)

665
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,431
(audience applause)

666
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:31,633
(Liberace) l'm supposed to lead
into the finale ofmy show right now,...

667
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,399
..but l'm having such a wonderful time...

668
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,476
Paul.

669
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,308
Hm?

670
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,037
l know you've been out.

671
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,675
What?

672
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,473
You've been out of your room.

673
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,917
No, l haven't.

674
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:00,831
Paul, my little ceramic penguin
in the study always faces due south.

675
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,517
l don't... l don't know
what you're talking about.

676
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,071
Ceramic penguin?

677
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,514
ls this what you're looking for?

678
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,750
l know you've been out twice, Paul.

679
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:21,591
At first l couldn't figure out how you did it,
but last night... l found your key.

680
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,432
l know l left my scrapbook out.

681
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,869
l can imagine what
you might be thinking of me.

682
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,514
But you see, Paul, it's all OK.

683
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:37,077
Last night it came so clear.
l realise you just need more time.

684
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:40,237
Eventually you'll come to accept
the idea of being here.

685
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:45,239
Paul, do you know about the early days
at the Kimberley diamond mines?

686
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,909
Do you know what they did to
the native workers who stole diamonds?

687
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,190
Don't worry. They didn't kill them.

688
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:54,915
That would be like junking a Mercedes
just because it had a broken spring.

689
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:58,157
No, they had to make sure
they could go on working,...

690
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,192
..but they also had to make sure
they could never run away.

691
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,959
The operation was called "hobbling".

692
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:19,036
Annie... Whatever you're thinking
about doing, please don't do it.

693
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:27,558
- Annie, for God's...
- Shh, darling. Trust me.

694
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:28,755
God's sake!

695
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,235
- lt's for the best.
- Annie, please!

696
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,476
Agh!

697
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:37,118
Almost done. Just one more.

698
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:41,996
Agh!

699
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,310
God, l love you.

700
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,318
(tyres screech)

701
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,237
(horn)

702
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,109
You cockadoodie!

703
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,270
- (man) Turn on this!
- (Annie) You poop!

704
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:53,319
- Just leave it, all right?
- Oh, l like that tone!

705
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:58,036
How many times must l tell you? l have a
system here! Where the hell is that thing?

706
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,799
- What thing?
- The thing!

707
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:05,110
- Here it is, where it's supposed to be.
- What is it?

708
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,955
l'm not sure. Maybe nothing.

709
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:12,358
- Well, l'm glad you found it.
- There's that spice again.

710
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,995
(Annie) Come on, Misie. Come on.

711
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,549
Hi, punkin.

712
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:36,116
Such a kidder! Come on, Misery.

713
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,598
Come on, Misie.

714
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:48,717
- Hey, Pete.
- Buster.

715
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:52,355
- Answer me a couple of things.
- lf l can.

716
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,755
Do you have any new
Paul Sheldon books?

717
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,350
Well, we had a batch.
Sold 'em all out in three days.

718
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:02,439
You wouldn't happen to know
if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?

719
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,075
Are you kidding? Every time
that fella writes a new book,...

720
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,760
..she has me set aside the first copy.

721
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,758
Has she been buying anything odd lately?

722
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,236
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.

723
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,000
Lest you call paper odd.

724
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:24,113
- Newspaper?
- No. The typing kind.

725
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,118
Oh, that kind. Nothing odd about that.

726
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:30,952
- Miz Wilkes done something?
- Not a thing.

727
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,676
(car approaches)

728
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:05,789
(footsteps)

729
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,313
Agh!

730
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,680
l don't think l'll ever understand you.
l cook your meals,...

731
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,633
..l tend to you
practically 24 hours a day,...

732
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:39,276
..and you continue to fight me. When
are we going to develop a sense of trust?

733
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,679
Oh, my!

734
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:12,713
Sorry, l didn't mean to startle you,
but you didn't give me a chance to knock.

735
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:18,153
l guess you can tell l'm not all that used
to visitors. What can l do for you?

736
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:22,114
Well, l was wondering, do you happen
to know anything about Paul Sheldon?

737
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,910
What do you want to know?

738
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,429
Well, anything you could
tell me might help.

739
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:31,319
Well, he was born in Worcester,
Massachusetts, 45 years ago,...

740
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,716
..the only child of Franklin and
Helene Sheldon, mediocre student...

741
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:37,673
That isn't exactly the kinda
information l'm after.

742
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,314
See, he's been missing
for some time now, and...

743
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:43,273
l know. lt's so upsetting.
l'm his number one fan.

744
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,834
l've got all his books.
Every sentence he ever put down.

745
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,872
l'm so proud
of my Paul Sheldon collection.

746
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,634
Well, here l am prattling on
and my manners have just flown away.

747
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,796
l haven't invited you in. Please.

748
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,876
Thank you.

749
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,158
Of course, you must know
about that horrible accident.

750
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,751
- Mind if l take a look around?
- Of course not.

751
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:10,992
That accident almost killed me, too.
l prayed when l heard the news.

752
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:14,396
l got down on my knees
and l begged for it not to be true.

753
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:19,196
You're gonna laugh at what l'm about
to say, but go ahead, l don't care.

754
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:23,233
When l was praying,
God told me to get ready.

755
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,670
- Get ready for what?
- To be his replacement.

756
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,314
He gave so much pleasure
to so many people...

757
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:32,238
..and there's a shortage of pleasure
on the planet these days,...

758
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,351
..in case you hadn't noticed.

759
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,994
God told me,
since l was his number one fan,...

760
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,510
..that l should make up new stories
as if l was Paul Sheldon.

761
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,599
So l went to town, and l bought
a typewriter, and paper to type on,...

762
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:47,075
..the same kind Paul Sheldon used.

763
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:51,398
And l turned the guest bedroom into
a writing studio. Would you like to see it?

764
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,034
- Sure.
- lt's right this way.

765
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:08,360
l know how he wrote. The kinds of words
he used, the wonderful stories he told...

766
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,790
l've spent the last four weeks
trying to write like Paul Sheldon,...

767
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,638
..but l can't do it right.

768
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,470
l try and l try, and l know all the words,
but it's just not the same.

769
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:22,115
Well, maybe it takes a while
to get the hang of it.

770
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:25,915
l could give you a coupla hundred pages
and you could tell me what you think.

771
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,871
l'm not much of a critic.

772
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,956
Well, l just thought...

773
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:34,712
Oh, you'd think l'd never had a guest
before! Would you like a cup of cocoa?

774
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:37,115
- No, really, l don't...
- lt's no trouble.

775
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,549
There's some already made.

776
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:49,070
Must get lonely,
living out here all by yourself.

777
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:53,234
Well, if you can't enjoy
your own company,...

778
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,430
..you're not fit company for anyone else.

779
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,790
Well, you've got a point there.

780
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,876
(both chuckle)

781
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,035
Here you are.

782
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:07,870
Well, thanks, Miz Wilkes, but l don't
wanna take up any more of your time.

783
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,757
l best be going.

784
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,872
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.

785
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,039
l'm sure it's wonderful,
but l really should be getting back.

786
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:26,555
lf you wouldn't mind, perhaps l could
pay you another visit sometime.

787
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:29,672
l'd be delighted.
Now that you know the way.

788
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,072
(clanking)

789
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,116
Miz Wilkes?

790
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,189
Miz Wilkes, are you all right?

791
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,678
(Paul) Here!

792
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,518
Here! l'm down here!

793
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,396
l'm down here!

794
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,478
Mr Sheldon?

795
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,636
Don't feel bad, Paul.

796
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:20,990
lt was bound to happen
sooner or later. lt's a sign.

797
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:27,430
You see, l've known for some time
why l was chosen to save you.

798
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:30,552
You and l were meant
to be together for ever.

799
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,114
But now our time in this world must end.

800
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:38,392
But don't worry, Paul.
l've prepared for what must be done.

801
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:44,469
l put two bullets in my gun,
one for you and one for me.

802
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:48,394
Oh, darling, it'll be so beautiful.

803
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,475
(footsteps)

804
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,236
Now don't be afraid.

805
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,316
l love you.

806
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,832
l love you, too.

807
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,832
And you're right.
We are meant to be together.

808
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,835
And l know we must die.

809
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:32,279
But it must be... so that Misery can live.

810
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:38,751
We have the power
to give Misery eternal life.

811
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,630
We must finish the book.

812
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:49,229
But the time is now.
Soon others will come.

813
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,195
lt's almost finished.

814
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,914
By dawn...

815
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:01,636
..we'll be able to give Misery...
back to the world.

816
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,749
l'll fix you something to eat.

817
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:46,355
Oh, Paul, l'm dying! Does she
wind up with lan or Windthorne?

818
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:50,639
You'll know very soon.
l've just started the last chapter.

819
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:56,673
You know... when l finish...
l'd like everything to be perfect.

820
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:59,557
l'll need three things.

821
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:01,636
What things?

822
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,436
You mean you don't know?

823
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,755
l was fooling, silly.

824
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:10,917
You need a cigarette, because
you used to smoke but quit,...

825
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:14,237
..except when you finish a book,
and you have just one.

826
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:21,072
And the match is to light it, and you need
one glass of champagne, Dom Perig-non.

827
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:24,029
Dom Perig-non it is.

828
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,552
Annie?

829
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:46,469
Annie!

830
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:48,754
Yes, Paul?

831
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,676
l'm almost done.

832
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:55,314
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic!

833
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:58,637
lan and Windthorne duelling
for the right to Misery's hand.

834
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:02,958
Does lan win? Oh, don't tell me...
lt's Windthorne, right?

835
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:07,312
You'll know everything in a minute.
Get the champagne.

836
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,755
Oh... Oh...

837
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:44,715
Did l do good?

838
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,755
You did perfect.

839
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,555
Except for one thing.

840
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:55,038
This time we'll need... two glasses.

841
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,396
Oh, Paul!

842
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,799
Remember how, all those years, nobody
knew who Misery's real father was?

843
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:39,674
Or if they'd ever be reunited?
lt's all right here.

844
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:43,429
Does she finally marry lan,
or will it be Windthorne?

845
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,030
lt's all right here.

846
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,791
Paul, you can't!

847
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,275
Why not? l learned it from you.

848
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:58,233
No, no, no! Not Misery! Not my Misery!

849
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,074
No! Not my Misery!

850
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:15,433
l'm gonna kill you, you lying cocksucker!

851
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:20,878
Agh!

852
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,629
Agh!

853
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,872
Here, you want it? You want it?! Eat it!

854
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,437
Eat it till you choke,
you sick, twisted fuck!

855
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,156
(Annie screams)

856
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:51,992
This is it. The very first copy.

857
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:55,192
The word l'm getting
is the Times review will be a love letter.

858
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,673
That'll be a first.

859
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:59,712
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek
say they're both raves.

860
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:03,389
And don't laugh, but l think
you've got a shot at some prizes.

861
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,279
Great.

862
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:09,075
l thought you'd be thrilled.
You're being taken seriously.

863
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:13,591
l'm delighted the critics are liking it
and l hope the people like it, too.

864
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:16,075
But... l wrote it for me.

865
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,793
Now, don't think
l'm completely nuts, but...

866
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:24,356
..in some way... Annie Wilkes...

867
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,795
..that whole experience, uh...

868
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:30,751
..helped me.

869
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,871
Paul, since you brought her up,...

870
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,276
..l have to ask this or l'll be
drummed out of the agents' union.

871
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:39,915
How would you feel about
a non-fiction book about what went on?

872
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:42,600
Gee, if l didn't know better
l'd think you were suggesting...

873
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:46,156
..l dredge up the worst horror
of my life just to make a few bucks.

874
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:49,312
l thought you were over it.

875
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:52,591
l don't know if anyone could totally
get over something like that.

876
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:54,676
lt's weird.

877
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,594
Even though l know she's dead,...

878
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:02,118
..l still think about her once in a while.

879
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:05,835
Excuse me. l don't mean to bother you,
but are you Paul Sheldon?

880
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:07,508
Yes.

881
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:10,359
l just wanna tell you
l'm your number one fan.

882
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,669
That's very sweet of you.

883
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:19,396

* ln that small café

888
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:51,113
* The park across the way

889
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,476
* The children's carousel

890
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:01,034
* The chestnut trees

891
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,672

892
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:10,515

* l'll find you in the morning sun

897
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:41,911
* And when the night is new

* l'll be looking at the moon

899
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:53,077
