Yeah. Why? Are you trying to clown?

488

No, I'm not trying to clown.
No, not at all. I think they're awesome.

491
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:13,416
Yeah. I mean, we're two adults,

in getting to know the other one,

at a designated time,

"Siri, what is a date?"

00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:28,166
- …Arnold wouldn't go for it.
- [imitates gunshot]

653
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,666
Yeah, it's a shame you missed out on
that first wave of early gentrification.

654
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,291
You could've screwed a lot
of people out of their property value.

655
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:38,208
[chuckles] Okay, so this is our lovely
and very opinionated daughter Liza.

656
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:40,750
Come and meet
your brother's new girlfriend.

657
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:41,666
Hi.

658
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:43,750
Hi. [chuckles]

659
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:45,250
I mean,

660
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,583
hey.

661
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:48,583
Okay.

662
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:49,708
[scoffs] Pull over.

663
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:51,541
[laughing]

664
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:53,875
- She's spoken for. [chuckles]
- [Amira chuckles]

665
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:56,500
Um, Liza's gay.
She's queer. She's lesbian.

666
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:59,958
- L-G-B-T-Q.
- [Shelley] You got it all.

667
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:02,458
- Which we love and accept.
- [Arnold] Yes.

668
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,291
"Because that is our vibe."

669
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:06,708
"That's how we roll." [laughs]

670
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:10,250
I think she understands.
Is she doing the air quote thing again?

671
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,833
Yeah, she's just warming up.

672
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:12,833
[laughs]

673
00:29:12,916 --> 00:29:15,625
Oh, I… I really like your glasses.
Those are cool.

674
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:19,500
Oh, thanks. I actually made them out
of recycled cans of Mountain Dew.

675
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:20,416
Oh, really?

676
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,833
I could easily make you a pair.
You could have... they're prescription...

677
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:28,666
Okay, so I wanna put this out
to the group and see how it lands.

678
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,583
Oh, shit.

679
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:32,583

- Okay!

…are and always have been, by the way,

681
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,833
fucked up towards Black people.

682
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:40,833
And I, for one, hate it.

683
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:43,041
- To be fair, it's an impossible job.
- Dad.

684
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,875
Okay, Mom,
I'm gonna help you in the kitchen.

685
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:46,041
- [Shelley] What?
- [Ezra] Now.

686
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:48,583
You've never offered
to help with anything in your life.

687
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:49,875
We're gonna do it now.

688
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,208
- Know what else too?
- Come on.

689
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,500

I think everybody should kneel.

690
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,708
- [Ezra] Enough. Thank you.
- [Shelley] No, I do. Really.

691
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:58,708

- [Ezra] We're gonna go check this out now.

- [Ezra] Thank you.

[chuckles]

694
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,291
I'm sorry about my mom.

695
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:07,875
- She's literally a moron.
- I like your braids.

696
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:09,541
Thank you. [sighs]

697
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,166
Xzibit had braids.

698
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,125
Uh, yeah.

699
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:16,833
Remember that show <i>Pimp My Ride?</i>
That was a blast. I loved that show.

700
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,666
He seemed like such a cool dude.
Such a gentleman.

701
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,833
You ever bump into him
at any of your showbiz things?

702

- [Arnold] No?

- [groans] Is he still in the rap game?
- Dad, stop.

704

Okay, can you just cool it

708
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:43,166
on everything you are doing and saying
in, like, complete totality?

709
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,708
You are so rude and annoying.

710
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:48,875
- All right? Yes, you are.
- [scoffs]

711

I am being me, and I am thriving.

712
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:54,083
And I have gotten through
my entire life being me,

713
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:57,708
and I certainly don't need
my son to tell me how to behave.

714
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:58,791
My God.

715
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:01,750
It's just with the police stuff
and, like, Magic Johnson.

716
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:05,375
Like, you're talking to her
like she's a Black person

717
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:07,750
and not my girlfriend who is a person.

718
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,875
- That's absurd. I said...
- Is it?

719
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:12,208
Yes, of course!
I said, "to the group," okay?

720
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:16,333
I literally said, "I'm throwing this out
to the whole group."

721
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,000
You weren't throwing it out to the group.

722
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:20,208
'Cause you weren't trying
to hear Dad's perspective.

talk about police brutality?

Can't get enough of it.

732

- Can't get enough of that conversation.
- I don't buy that.

733
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:43,458
It's a hot topic right now.

734
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,958
All right, look.
Can we not do this right now?

with that? [sniffles]

817
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:23,958
Talk to me.

818
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,333
Work… Work is fine.

819
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,708
Grinding. I know.

820
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:32,541
I know. I'm in the grind myself.

821
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,166
[mother chuckles]

822
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,208
So do you hang out
in the hood all the time,

823
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:43,541
or do you just come up here
for our food and women?

824
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,958
It's a valid question.

825
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,583
- It is.
- [mother] Mm-hmm.

826
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:55,166
I guess I'm one of those guys
who kind of goes wherever.

827
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,541
You go wherever?

828
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:59,375
Yeah, I'm kind of like a chameleon
in that way, I guess.

829
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:03,291
You know, I'll pop into Marathon
and grab a hoodie and some socks,

830
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:07,333
or, you know,
go play ball at Langston Hughes Park

831
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:08,541
if there's a good run going,

832
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:10,666
and Roscoe's is obviously one
of my go-to's.

833
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,291
I mean, the Carol C. Special. Come on!
Where's our waiter?

834
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:16,375
I'm gonna go see if the waitperson's here

835
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,875
because I feel like we should get it,

836
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:21,833
'cause I think you guys
deserve more than this.

837
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,625
This is your white granddaddy
coming back to haunt me.

838
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:30,750
- What?
- That nigga never liked me.

839
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:34,041
And it started off by him putting
them strong ass genes in you

840
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,333
that lighten up the coffee in my babies.

841
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:38,041
- Akbar, you sound ridiculous.
- Yeah.

842
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:40,500
And then he planted
a poison pill in my little baby girl

843
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:44,500
and it has grown into this white boy
that has invited us to lunch at Roscoe's.

844
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:48,041
Those children got
beautiful cultural experiences

845
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,541
from those moments
with my granddaddy, so please stop.

846
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,833
- What they got was confused, clearly.
- They are not confused.

847
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:56,291
They are confused.
You don't think this is confusion?

848
00:36:56,375 --> 00:37:00,250
All I'mma tell you is we don't need to be
arguing in front of the white boy, okay?

849
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,708
I'm not gonna change
how I feel about this…

850
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:04,708
I'm saying what I wanna say,

851
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:06,833
and I don't give a fuck
about this white boy.

852
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:08,375
I'm not asking you to do that.

853
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:09,875
Hey, gang.

854
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:12,375
[clears throat] I'm back.
I spoke to the waitress,

855
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:17,250
and she was upset
that I interrupted her smoke break.

856
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:19,916
Um, so,

857
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,541
you guys are probably
wondering why I asked you to… to lunch.

858
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,333
It crossed my mind.

859
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:30,791
- Yeah, what the hell is this about?
- [Ezra] Um…

860
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,666
I wanna… I wanna…
I wanna go way back for a second.

861
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,416
I wanna go back to…

862
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,833
Well, let's go with Jesus,

863
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:40,625
'cause Jesus Christ
was half Black, half Jewish, right?

864
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,958
Let's start with Jesus. Legend, right? So…

865
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:48,416
Jesus Christ, technically,
I imagine, had mixed-race children,

866
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,083
which I think is… is great because
mixed-race people are really awesome.

867
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,458
You know, you have,
like, Mariah and Derek Jeter,

868
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:58,291
and then, of course,
you have the GOAT. He was mixed race.

869
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:00,291
The GOAT?

870
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,083
The Greatest of All Time.

871
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:04,791
Yeah, I know what it means,
but who are you referring to?

872
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:08,083
Our guy, the legend. Malcolm X.

873
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:10,250
<i>- Our </i>guy?
- [Akbar laughs]

874
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:13,791
- Not... the GOAT. Not… Not my guy. Mr. X.
- [mother laughs]

875
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,708
And I'm saying that, like, he's mixed race

876
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:20,583
and then if Amira and I had a kid,
that kid would be mixed race,

877
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,708
and it would be a very nice baby.

878
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:26,875
Maybe not as important
as Malcolm X, but maybe. Maybe!

879
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:29,583
Maybe my son would be
as important as Malcolm X.

880
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:31,083
I don't know 'cause I haven't...

881
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:34,708
And she's not pregnant.
She's not pregnant.

882
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:38,625
Because we don't even do that much stuff

883
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:40,333
and when we do,

884
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:43,125
I… I am careful.

885
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,541
And she's not a prude.

886
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:47,791
She's gr... really,
she knows her way around it.

887
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,416
- Okay.
- What I'm saying is I love your daughter!

888
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:54,875
I… I love her,
and I would make a good husband.

889
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:59,583
What in the mother of...

890
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:01,166
I know I quoted <i>Forrest Gump.</i>

891
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,041
Yeah, you know what?
I did quote <i>Forrest Gump.</i>

892
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:06,416
Because you know who
Forrest's best friend was in the world?

893
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:07,833
Bubba.

894
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:11,291
- What?
- And was Bubba Black and Forrest white?

895
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:14,458
You bet your fucking ass they were.

896
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:17,333
And… And you know what?
It wasn't about race.

897
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:21,416
It was about shrimp and partnership,
and they made it work.

898
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,208
And Amira and I have done
a lot of the similar stuff

899
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:27,458
that Bubba and Forrest did together,
and now we're here,

900
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:30,375
and I just wanna marry your daughter,
if that's okay.

901
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:38,875
We never seen no fucking <i>Forrest Gump.</i>

902
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:40,833
[inhales]

903
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,416
- Ain't this about a bitch?
- [exhales]

904
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:48,833
So it's not bad enough
that y'all make me have to get a vaccine

905
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:50,458
so I can go into the casino.

906
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:53,416
- Now y'all coming after my kids?
- [mother groans]

907
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:56,333
So you wanna marry my daughter?

908
00:39:58,791 --> 00:40:00,208
Yes. Yes, I do.

909
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:04,541
Well, Ezra…

910
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:09,708
you can try.

911
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:15,208
- [knock on door]
- No, that's him right now, Mama.

912
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,625
- Oh, okay, I'll call you back.
- [phone beeps]

913
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,208
Hey, what's up?

914
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:26,208
I just got off the phone with my mom.

915
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:31,291
Oh, you… you did?
Yeah, what… what did she have to say?

916
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:32,375
About…

917
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:36,708
Well, she just told me
that you took her and my dad out to lunch.

918
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:39,666
It was a nightmare, okay?
I totally blacked out. I fucked up.

919
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,375
I have no idea. I don't remember anything.

920
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:44,583
Well, lucky for you,
my parents remember everything.

921
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:47,791
Why would you take my parents
to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles

922
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:49,208
and without asking me?

923
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:54,416
I was taking a shot at something, okay?
Just forget it.

924
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
Forget it?
Oh, no, please, Ezra, keep going,

925
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:59,500
'cause I would love to know
about this little brilliant plan of yours.

926
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:03,458
[exhales] You wouldn't understand, okay?

927
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:05,958
[sighs]

928
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:06,916
Oh, my God.

929
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,500
- [Ezra] I was gonna take your parents out…
- Wait, oh, my God.

930
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:11,708
-We were gonna have a great time,
-Oh, my God.

931
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:13,833
And then I was gonna ask their blessing,

932
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:16,041
and I had this
whole cute proposal planned,

933
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:18,916
where I was gonna reenact our first
few dates, but then it got messed up.

934
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,458
- No, it's not messed up. It's not.
- No, it is, 'cause your dad...

935
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:23,458
- No, it's not. Ezra! Ezra!
- Like, it's ruined.

936
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:25,791
- What?
- You can still go through with it.

937
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,333
When?

938
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:30,791
- Now! Right now!
- Like now?

939
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,541
Yes, right now.

940
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:36,041
- Right...
- Hurry up!

941
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:39,083
Okay, I'm gonna
take off my shoe so I don't crease it.

942
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,875
Amira… [exhales]

943
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:48,625
- I love you so much.
- Hmm.

944
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:53,583
I have never felt so understood
by somebody in my entire life.

945
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,958
I am blown away by your beauty

946
00:41:57,666 --> 00:41:59,625
and your intelligence and your grace.

947
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:00,916
[Amira sighs]

948
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,125
And now you just do whatever you wanna do.

949
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:06,000
And if you let me,

950
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:10,208
I will do everything in my power
to give you the most beautiful life,

951
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:14,000
filled with love and laughter and joy.

952
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,833
Amira, will you marry me?

953
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:21,708
Of course.

954
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:22,791
You will?

955
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,291
- [Amira chuckles] Yes!
- Oh, my God.

956
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:30,166
[exhales]

957
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,458
Oh! Oh, my God!

958
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:35,166
It's from the Holocaust,
so that's why it's small.

959
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:37,583
- [Amira] Oh, I love you.
- I love you.

960
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:39,958
[Amira] I need some color, look.

961
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,583
Sorry it's so small.

962
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:44,333
No, it's beautiful.

963
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:48,541
So what's the story again?
It's your grandmother's?

964
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:51,166
Yeah, it's my grandmother's. It was her...

965
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,250
She got it in the Holocaust or whatever.

966
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:58,083
But like, how old is she
if it's from the Holocaust?

967
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,083
It's been a minute. I don't know.

968
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:03,041
I think she got engaged when
she was, like, three or four years old.

969
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,875
[laughing]

970
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:07,583
- It was a different time, you know.
- So stupid.

971
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:11,083
- It was a different…
- What is wrong with you? [laughing]

972
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:13,583
[chattering]

973
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,833
[Amira laughing]

974
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:22,333
[Ezra] Don, known you my whole life.

975
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:24,208
You've been an incredible boss.

976
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:25,291
I grew up with your kids.

977
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:28,083
Been on family vacations together.
You've always looked out for me.

978
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,166
- Mm-hmm.
- Been like a father to me.

979
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,125
And working for you these past ten years
has been life-changing.

980
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,125
But it's time for a new adventure.

981
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:39,750
That's it? That was great!

982
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:42,833
- That was really good.
- An adventure in podcasting.

983
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:47,083
Uh, maybe leave the podcast part out.

984
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,125
I'm gonna throw up.

985
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,250
No, wait, no, no, no.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen.

986
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:54,125
- Dude, I'm… [sighs]
- Listen. Listen to me though. Relax.

987
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:56,666
You're doing the right thing.
You just gotta do it.

988
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,208
You understand? You got the juice!

989
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,250
Repeat that. "I got the juice."

990
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,166
I got the juice.

991
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,041
- I got the juice.
- I got the juice.

992
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,666
Say it with some nuts. I got the juice.

993
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,375
- I got the juice!
- Believe in yourself!

994
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:10,750
- I got the juice!
- I'm not a buster. I got the juice.

995
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:13,416
I'm not a mark-ass buster like Don.
I got the juice, bitch!

996
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,875
- Period.
- Period!

997
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:17,541
Okay. Now, when you get home,
we're gonna watch <i>Juice,</i>

998
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:20,083
because I'm sure Shelley
didn't let you watch <i>Juice</i> growing up.

999
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:21,791
That is so disrespectful.

1000
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:23,708
- Is it?
- I've seen <i>Juice </i>more than you.

1001
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:25,875
- Ooh! [laughs]
- I love you.

1002
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:28,458
- I love you. You got this, okay?
- Thank you. All right.

1003
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:32,000
Come on, Don! You little bitch-ass Don!

1004
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,541
I'm coming for you, Don!

1005
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:34,958
- Okay.
- [Ezra] Come on!

1006
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:37,291
- [hip-hop music playing]
<i>- ♪ Insane… ♪</i>

1007
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,833
[Don] I do not care, Javier.

1008
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:43,375
- [exhales]
- [Don] Just get it!

1009
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:45,125
<i>♪ I'm just in pain… ♪</i>

1010
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:47,791
I don't give a rat's ass, okay?
How about that?

1011
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:51,958
My Maserati sounds like
it got gangbanged by the Toronto Raptors,

1012
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,125
so fix it!

1013
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:54,916
Jesus!

1014
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:56,583
What's up?

1015
00:44:58,541 --> 00:45:00,208
- Cars, huh?
- [Don sighs]

1016
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:02,708
Yeah.

1017
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:04,375
[Ezra] Mm-hmm.

1018
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:06,958
On… On that.

1019
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:09,333
Um… [sighs]

1020
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:11,125
I, uh, I don't…

1021
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:13,500
I don't think I'm gonna...

1022
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:16,333
I think I'm gonna
not come to work at this address…

1023
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:17,416
- What?
- …anymore.

1024
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,750
What are you talking about?

1025
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:22,583
[splutters] At a different address,
I'm gonna work...

1026
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:26,333
I'm not gonna work here at this address,
so I'm gonna, like, do a different place

1027
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:29,041
that I'm gonna do the work from
that's different work.

1028
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:31,833
Are you trying to quit on me?

1029
00:45:31,916 --> 00:45:33,333
Yeah. Goodbye.

1030
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:38,458
Pathetic. Who resigns in Helvetica?

1031
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:40,500
Wait, so you said, "Fuck you, Don"?

1032
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:42,333
Pretty much.

1033
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:43,375
What did he say?

1034
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:47,083
He was like, "You're a great guy.
And like, I'm sorry that..."

1035
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:49,916
"Like, I wish I did better
in a weird way too."

1036
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,833
And I was like, "It's all good,
but also like, don't…"

1037
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:55,000
- Period.
- You know, period.

1038
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:56,083
Oh, I love that.

1039
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:58,625
- To the juice.
- To the juice!

1040
00:45:58,708 --> 00:46:01,416
[Ezra] Mm. Mm. Mmm!

1041
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,333
All right.

1042
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:05,958
Let's talk wedding before I think
too hard about what I actually just did.

1043
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:09,291
[inhales] Um, sure.

1044
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:13,375
Huh. That's a super reassuring response.

1045
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:14,875
No, babe, I'm sorry.

1046
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:17,833
Look, you know
I love you to death. I really do.

1047
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:19,333
Uh-oh.

1048
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,458
I'm just a little worried.

1049
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:26,625
You know, since we got engaged
and got the house, my family,

1050
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:29,458
they've just been on my head
and not in a good way.

1051
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:30,375
So they hate me.

1052
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,333
- No! No, no, they don't.
- Your family hates me.

1053
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:35,458
They just don't know you yet, you know.
And I think…

1054
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:38,541
Look, this is gonna take
some getting used to for them.

1055
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:41,708
I mean, and can you honestly say
that your family's excited

1056
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:43,625
to have my Black ass in the picture?

1057
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:46,875
I think a good portion of them are.

1058
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:47,833
For sure.

1059
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:50,833
[sighs] All right.

1060
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,041
Let me think about this.

1061
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:56,791
[Amira sighs]

1062
00:46:56,875 --> 00:47:00,541
From where I'm sitting,
I think there's only one thing left to do.

1063
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:06,708
[Shelley] I mean, there are just
so many primary colors in this space.

1064
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:10,125
- Which is very uplifting.
- [Arnold] Alive.

1065
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:11,791
It really is.

1066
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:15,291
- And we are so thrilled about this.
- [mother] Mm.

1067
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:18,291
- Mm!
- [Shelley] I mean, they're just precious.

1068
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:19,333
[laughing]

1069
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:23,500
So have you cuties
made any, uh, wedding plans yet?

1070
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,041
You know, we've thrown some ideas around.

1071
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:29,041
Yeah, we're thinking something
really small and intimate

1072
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:30,833
that really just represents us.

1073
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:31,833
[Shelley] Uh-huh.

1074
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:34,875
But we should probably talk about
who's gonna officiate the wedding.

1075
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:37,125
Oh, Arnold already talked to Rabbi Singer.

1076
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:38,083
Singer is in!

1077
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:40,083
[Shelley] Yeah, he'd be honored.

1078
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:41,750
Rabbi Singer.

1079
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:44,958
- [mother] Hmm.
- So you're not gonna go with an imam?

1080
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:47,250
- [Amira hesitates] Um…
- Who's Auntie Mom?

1081
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,333
- There's no Auntie Mom. It's an "imam."
- Imam.

1082
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,833
Mm. I'm so sorry.
Can you spell that for me?

1083
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:55,458
I'll spell it for you later.
It's like a rabbi for Muslim people.

1084
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:56,708
- Thank you, Ezra.
- [Arnold] Oh.

1085
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,958
- [mother chuckles]
- Oh, so you're all Muslim?

1086
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:00,916
- Yes.
- Oh, yes, very much so.

1087
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,500
I love it.

1088
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:03,916
That's why I wear this crown.

1089
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,708
I love your crown. It's gorgeous.

1090
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:10,500
Babe, you wanna, um,
tell them the story behind that crown?

1091
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:13,041
Well, this kufi that I'm wearing right now

1092
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:15,875
was actually a gift
from the honorable Louis Farrakhan.

1093
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:19,750
Mmm! Love Farrakhan.

1094
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,166
You… You love Farrakhan?

1095
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:26,250
Love him. Can't get enough.

1096
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:29,416
He's… He's one of the GOATs.
He's another one of the GOATs.

1097
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,125
- Really? What do you love about Farrakhan?
- Yeah, what do you love about Farrakhan?

1098
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,208
Probably the same stuff that you do,
just more stuff.

1099
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:39,000
[Shelley, mother] Hmm.

1100
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,958
Can you be a bit more specific?

1101
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:43,083
Yeah, um,

1102
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:47,958
I think what I love about him
is his general vibe.

1103
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:51,666
- [Akbar] Ah.
- He's got kind of a no-frills attitude.

1104
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:56,708
And I just think he tells it
like it's gotta be told sometimes.

1105
00:48:56,791 --> 00:48:58,166
- Just stop, babe.
- For sure, yeah.

1106
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,208
[mother] Ooh! Oh, babe,
maybe you should finish telling them

1107
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:03,500
about our private dinner
with the minister.

1108
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:07,583
Oh, well, we were blessed
to be in Brother Minister's company,

1109
00:49:07,666 --> 00:49:10,916
and, uh, I got to speak with him
for maybe, like, an hour or so.

1110
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,958
- Oh.
- [Akbar] We talked about everything.

1111
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:15,750
How far we've come
and how far we have to go as a people.

1112
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:16,666
No kidding.

1113
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:19,500
And at the end of the conversation,
he actually took this kufi off

1114
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:21,041
and put it on my head.

1115
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,750
So this is one of my most treasured gifts.

1116
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:25,083
- Isn't that incredible?
- Yes.

1117
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:27,291
Are you familiar with,
um, the minister's work?

1118
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:31,416
Well, I'm familiar
with what he said about the Jews.

1119
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,375
Let's have dinner.

1120
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:34,666
- Yeah.
- I am fucking... so fucking hungry.

1121
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:36,916
Let's get up and do it. Whoo!

1122
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,666
I found this great
new Sirius station on the radio.

1123
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,208
- It's '90s West Coast bangers.
- Hey!

1124
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:45,208
It has all the stuff.

1125
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:48,083
Yeah, Dad, I see you
driving down Xzibit highway,

1126
00:49:48,166 --> 00:49:51,500
and let's refocus it
to this dinner that Amira made,

1127
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:52,875
because she's a genius.

1128
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:56,166
- [chuckles] Okay, well, let's dig in.
- All right.

1129
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,666
So wait, wait, wait, wait.
We're not gonna say grace first?

1130
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:01,041
- [Ezra] No, I mean, yeah.
- Yeah.

1131
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,250
Oh, I was gonna say grace.

1132
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,500
- I mean, we say grace all the time, so…
- All the time.

1133
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:07,375
[Ezra] Muslim style,
so because you're here,

1134
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:10,083
maybe out of respect,
you would wanna lead.

1135
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:12,458
- [mother] Mm-hmm.
- Well, I will do the honors.

1136
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:15,666
- [exhales]
- [silverware clatters]

1137
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,958
[Shelley] Oh.

1138
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:22,125
[Akbar] All praises be to Allah,
who fed us and provided us with drink…

1139
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:23,291
[whispers] Close your eyes.

1140
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:25,166
[Akbar] …and made us
from among the Muslims.

1141
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,833
All praises be to Allah,

1142
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:29,208
who fed me this and provided it for me

1143
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:31,250
without any power or might from myself.

1144
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:34,625
- Correct.
- [Akbar speaking Arabic]

1145
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,750
- <i>Amin.</i>
- [Ezra] Definitely.

1146
00:50:37,833 --> 00:50:39,250
<i>- Amin.</i>
- Amen.

1147
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:41,625
- [all] <i>Amin.</i>
- [Shelley splutters]

1148
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,333
I couldn't have said it better myself.

1149
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:47,333
So, Ezra tells me that you guys
used to have a boat growing up.

1150
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:48,416
[Shelley] Yeah.

1151
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,791
I was thinking that maybe one day

1152
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:52,291
we can rent a boat and go out.

1153
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:53,416
- Hang out.
- [Arnold] Oh.

1154
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,958
- All of us.
- That would be really fun.

1155
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:56,916
- I can make that happen.
- We'll think about it.

1156
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,833
Because Black folks don't really
have a good relationship with boats.

1157
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:02,333
[laughing] That's very true. Or water.

1158
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:05,541
[chuckling] Kind of like Jews
with trains, right?

1159
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:07,208
- [Arnold] Wow. Bingo.
- [Shelley] Hmm.

1160
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:08,791
[laughing]

1161
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:12,291
[scoffs] Are you trying
to compare the Holocaust to slavery?

1162
00:51:13,958 --> 00:51:17,083
Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm not doing...
I mean, I wouldn't do that.

1163
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:23,500
Al… Although,
you know, if you think about it,

1164
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:27,625
I think the Blacks and the Jews
have a similar struggle.

1165
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:28,916
- [Arnold] Hmm.
- [Shelley] Yeah.

1166
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,916
No. So you are kind of sort of
comparing the two.

1167
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,041
- Just a little bit.
- Can you pass the potatoes this way, hmm?

1168
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:38,791
Well, the Jews were technically
the original slaves.

1169
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:41,666
- Right? OG slaves.
- [Shelley] Oh, that's interesting.

1170
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,666
Oh, you going all the way back to Egypt.

1171
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:47,041
Okay, well, you do know that
that was 3,500 years ago.

1172
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:50,250
Slavery is one
great-grandparent away for us.

1173
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:52,625
- That is correct.
- You know. My grandmother picked cotton.

1174
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,708
Well, Daddy,
I don't think that they were trying...

1175
00:51:54,791 --> 00:51:56,958
- No, it's true, honey.
- My grandmother picked cotton.

1176
00:51:57,041 --> 00:52:00,208
I don't have to go back to Egypt.
I just go back 75 years.

1177
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:03,583
You know, Jews make up one-half of 1%
of the world's population,

1178
00:52:03,666 --> 00:52:05,708
because we were
systematically annihilated.

1179
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:06,666
Exactly.

1180
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,750
The one and one-half percent
of the population that you make up

1181
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:12,291
seems to be doing pretty good right now.

1182
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:17,916
Uh, yeah, okay, but… [chuckles]

1183
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,583
Here's the thing.
It's not like we don't work hard for it.

1184
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:27,166
You know? I mean Arnold,
he works super-duper hard in his practice.

1185
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:30,625
- He's a podiatrist. You do, honey.
- And… And what did his father do?

1186
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:32,166
He was a podiatrist.

1187
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,541
And what about his father?

1188
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:36,333
He was a… a podiatrist.

1189
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:37,875
- Yeah, so…
- [Arnold] Well.

1190
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:40,791
- And a bookie.
- Yes, he did that on the side.

1191
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:42,041
He went straight.

1192
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,083
[Shelley] All I'm saying
is that our people

1193
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:46,833
came here with nothing
like everybody else.

1194
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:50,083
Actually, you kind of sort of came here

1195
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:53,083
with the money that you made
from the slave trade.

1196
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:54,541
- What? Oh!
- [Akbar] Preach.

1197
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:56,708
- Preach, Mother. Preach, Mother.
- [Arnold] Holy moly.

1198
00:52:56,791 --> 00:52:58,333
- Come on.
- It's true. It's very tr...

1199
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:01,208
- I would like to see your sources on that.
- Baby, go get my purse.

1200
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:03,125
I've got my slave receipts in my purse.

1201
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:05,916
- Go get my purse.
- [Akbar] Take that off the table.

1202
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,250
I don't turn on the news every day
and see people in yarmulkes getting shot

1203
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:12,458
by police because they was out
minding their business.

1204
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:15,833
Okay, first of all, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

1205
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:17,875
- A very uncomfortable conversation.
- [chattering]

1206
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:20,583
Ever figure out what happened
with the potatoes? An ETA on those?

1207
00:53:20,666 --> 00:53:21,500
I'm trying.

1208
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:22,416
[mother sneezes]

1209
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,583
Are you okay?

1210
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:26,541
I think we need to blow the candles out.
I'm getting an allergic reaction.

1211
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:28,208
Babe, can you move the candles?

1212
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:30,000
- Yes.
- Can you get these candles out of here?

1213
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:31,708
- [Shelley] Yes.
- Candles smell like shit.

1214
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,833
- [chattering]
- No, it's okay. I got it.

1215
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:37,416
When my grandmother was picking cotton,
your grandfather's picking feet.

1216
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,583
Yes, I agree.

1217
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:40,666
[Ezra] I just want you to sit down.
I am hosting.

1218
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:43,250
- [chattering]
- No, no. There they go!

1219
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:44,833
I am supposed...

1220
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:47,666
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- [screaming]

1221
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,750
- Oh, shit!
- [Ezra] Oh, shit!

1222
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:52,458
- Grab some water or something!
- [Akbar] Oh, shit! What the fuck!

1223
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:54,416
What are you doing? Hey! No!

1224
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,125
- [shouting]
- No! No!

1225
00:53:57,208 --> 00:54:00,541
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry! Oh, my God.

1226
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:01,750
[gasps]

1227
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:03,000
[mother] Oh, Lord.

1228
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:04,208
Oh, shit.

1229
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:06,625
[Amira sighs]

1230
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:10,666
What are we gonna do?

1231
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:14,708
- About the kufi? It's gone, baby.
- No, our parents.

1232
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:16,541
Who cares?

1233
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:19,375
Like, we don't even have to
worry about that.

1234
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:22,041
I mean, your dad's intense, yeah,
but we knew that going in.

1235
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:24,500
What is that supposed to mean?

1236
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:28,208
Guess it's supposed to mean that
he didn't smile or make one joke...

1237
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:31,125
Oh, wow. Are you trying to say
that my dad's an angry Black man?

1238
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:32,791
I never said he was angry, no.

1239
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:35,708
Yeah, but you're saying
a Black man is intense,

1240
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:37,625
which is insinuating that he is.

1241
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:40,333
He is Black, and he's intense.

1242
00:54:40,416 --> 00:54:43,833
Yeah, but you don't say that
as a white person about a Black person,

1243
00:54:43,916 --> 00:54:45,791
calling them "aggressive" or "intense."

1244
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:48,833
That's being passive-aggressive
saying that he's an angry Black man.

1245
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:51,500
- Should I say he's not intense?
- Say nothing about my dad.

1246
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:53,708
If anyone should have any beef,
it's with your mom.

1247
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,541
She set my dad's kufi on fire.

1248
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,500
What's wrong with my mom?
I mean, yeah, she's, like, an idiot,

1249
00:54:58,583 --> 00:54:59,916
but she still, like, means well.

1250
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,708
It's not like she did it on purpose.

1251
00:55:01,791 --> 00:55:03,875
Mm. Yeah, I don't know about that.

1252
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:08,750
All right, I'm not gonna argue
about something so ridiculous, okay?

1253
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:11,000
[sighs] All right,
let's talk about the rabbi.

1254
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:14,458
I don't think we need that.
Let's just have a friend of ours do it.

1255
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:16,958
[inhales] Um,
I would like to use our imam.

1256
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:19,208
Your imam?

1257
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:20,666
[Amira] Mm-hmm.

1258
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:24,333
Okay, Miss Shakur.
When did you get so Muslim?

1259
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:25,958
I've been Muslim. I was born Muslim.

1260
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:28,708
And it's important to my dad,
so I think we should go with it.

1261
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:30,541
Was that Muslim bacon you ate yesterday?

1262
00:55:30,625 --> 00:55:32,583
It actually was. It was Jewish bacon.

1263
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:33,583
- Jewish bacon?
- Yeah.

1264
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:35,208
- I don't claim to be super Jewish.
- Okay.

1265
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:37,875
- I eat bacon all day. I don't care.
- Okay. Well, so what? And?

1266
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:39,500
- Yeah, you want an imam to marry us.
- So?

1267
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:41,166
Want me to face the bed towards Mecca?

1268
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,208
- I can do that.
- Actually, I do. Very much so.

1269
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:46,125
Okay, cool, I love that four hours ago
you became a devout Muslim.

1270
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:48,500
- For sure.
- Your dad's not even that Muslim!

1271
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:51,416
He heard "Fight the Power" once
and changed his name from Woody to Akbar.

1272
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,041
Okay, now you're
going all out of line. Relax.

1273
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:56,125
- You told me that. We joke about it.
- Yeah.

1274
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:58,583
But I didn't tell you that
for you to turn around and tell me.

1275
00:55:58,666 --> 00:56:01,625
You're being... Really, low-key,
you're being an asshole.

1276
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:05,041
- I'm being an asshole?
- Yes.

1277
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:08,208
- [Ezra] Okay.
- [exhales]

1278
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:14,166
You know what?
I really... I don't wanna fight. I can't.

1279
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,666
I don't wanna fight about it, okay?

1280
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:19,666
We just had too much
going on tonight. I just… I can't.

1281
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:22,708
Me either.
I don't wanna fight about it either.

1282
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:24,708
[exhales]

1283
00:56:25,291 --> 00:56:28,500
[inhales] Look,
I think our time would be best used

1284
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:31,166
if we just think about how
to move forward.

1285
00:56:31,916 --> 00:56:32,916
I agree.

1286
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:37,208
I'm gonna pitch that we just never speak
to these people ever again

1287
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:39,250
and just a full, clean break.

1288
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:42,166
We cannot do that.

1289
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:48,041
You know, I'm thinking that maybe
if we spend more time with them together,

1290
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:51,375
maybe you and my dad can kind of hang out,
just you and him.

1291
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:54,166
Sounds rad.

1292
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:56,416
Then I think he can get comfortable
with you, you know.

1293
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,791
And then maybe he'll see
what we have going on.

1294
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:03,250
Just might make him feel, you know…
and you too.

1295
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:06,958
- Okay.
- Okay.

1296
00:57:08,083 --> 00:57:09,541
- [sighs]
- Okay.

1297
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:12,666
I gotta go to sleep. I started my period,
and it's just been hell.

1298
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,041
Yeah, I'm worried too,

1299
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:16,833
'cause I haven't gotten
my period in, like, 35 years.

1300
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:22,125
- I should see a doctor or something.

Do you have, like, some dream Bitcoin

or a dream 401(k) or some shit?

1319

meeting your parents the other night,

1333
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:06,083
but I felt so horrible
about your father's kufi.

I have a little piece of it left,

1336
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,916
and I was thinking
maybe I could frame it or something.

1337

- Oh, no. It's okay.
- Yeah.

1338

- Yes.

No, it's not a closet.

I want a red... I want a red one.

1620
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:06,833
You want the red one?
We got that. So the red is gone.

1621
01:12:06,916 --> 01:12:08,416

1622
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,708
Oh, I'll bring the suits, yeah.

1623
01:12:09,791 --> 01:12:12,458
I'll bring the suits.
I got 40 hood <i>Tron</i> suits,

1624
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:14,208
and, uh, they light up.

1625
01:12:14,291 --> 01:12:16,458
- All of 'em work. It's gonna be great.
- [Akbar] Mm.

1626
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:18,875
- And you have 40 of them?
- Forty of 'em.

1627
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:21,666
Anybody outside of y'all wedding,
more than 40 people,

1628
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,083
then that's on y'all.

1629
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:26,083
I wouldn't bring them
'cause they couldn't fit in the suit.

1630
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:28,833
They gonna look weird
without being in a suit.

1631
01:12:28,916 --> 01:12:31,333
- It'll be cool, brother. There you go.
- That sounds different.

1632
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:34,583
- Ain't nobody did the Tron wedding.
- [Demetrius] Ain't nobody did that.

1633

Yo, our parents are killing us.

1634
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:37,750
I know.

1635
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:41,416
The good news is
we are almost done with it.

1636
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,583
And they've been so busy,
they're basically out of our lives.

1637
01:12:44,666 --> 01:12:46,708
You're right.
I haven't heard from my mom in days.

1638
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:47,958
It's been amazing.

1639
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:50,750
Yeah, I haven't heard
from my dad either, which is rare,

1640
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:54,833
because he hasn't even sent one
of his "form follows function" texts.

1641
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:57,708
Do you think
something terrible happened to him?

1642
01:12:57,791 --> 01:13:00,166
Oh, my God, no. Why would you say that?

1643
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:01,875
No, I... that would be horrible.

1644
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:07,416
That would be the worst.
I'm just making sure he's okay.

1645
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,500
Anyway, babe, I gotta go.

1646
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:11,708
- I don't wanna be late. Kiss.
- You look beautiful.

1647
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:13,416
Thank you.

1648
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,416
You're gonna kill it.
Remember, you got the juice.

1649
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,291
You really
haven't seen that movie, have you?

1650
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:20,708
If you fucking say
I haven't seen <i>Juice</i> one more time,

1651
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:22,083

1652

[Amira laughs]

1653
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:28,041
That's why with the Victorian dress,
I went with the blues and the greens.

1654
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:30,291
A very rich color for this time.

1655
01:13:30,375 --> 01:13:33,333
And just so you guys know, I have
really great relationships downtown,

1656
01:13:33,416 --> 01:13:36,625
and I can get high-quality fabrics
for, like, a fraction of the cost.

1657
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:38,250
- This is great.
- Yeah.

1658
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:40,458
I would love to leave you guys
with some of my sketches.

1659
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:41,625
[man] That would be amazing.

1660
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:44,041
Man. And can you remind me
when you graduated Harvard?

1661
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:46,000
It's just maybe we know the same people.

1662
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:48,041
Oh, um,

1663
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:51,166
I… I didn't go to, um, Harvard.
I went to Howard.

1664
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:54,000

1665
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:55,625

What's up?

1678
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:27,416
Yeah, man.
Hope it's not a problem me being here.

01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,791

I brought Omar too.

Hey, Omar.

1682
01:14:33,916 --> 01:14:36,875
Yeah, when I found out that Amira

1683
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:39,958
was gonna take your mother and sister
to Palm Springs with the girls,

1684
01:14:40,041 --> 01:14:43,583
I figured it'd be cool for me
to come hang out with the fellas.

1685
01:14:44,291 --> 01:14:47,166
- Yeah, that's such a good and normal idea.
- Yeah.

1686
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,500
Listen, when we're in Vegas,

1687
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:50,958
I don't want you thinking
I'm your future father-in-law.

1688
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:52,208
I'm not that guy.

1689

hanging out having a good time.

Hey, what's your boy's name again?

1691
01:14:58,291 --> 01:15:00,625
Uh, my name's Mo, and I have titties.

1692
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:03,750
- Oh, I'm sorry, bro... um, sister... Mo.
- [Mo] Mm-hmm.

1693
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,958
- Yeah.
- Yeah. [sighs]

1694
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:08,708

- I'm sorry about that, yeah.

1695

- Bro, I don't know.

1698

But his casual nature
is terrifying, all right?

1699

I've done that.

Hey, did you know that Mo had titties?

1704
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:34,500
Yeah, they're on her chest.

1705

Dude, uh, so what's your plan?

1706
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:40,333
We catch this kid with the beard
doing weird stupid shit,

1707
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:42,083
and you just snitch on him
to your daughter?

1708
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:46,125
No, we gonna just go down there
and make sure he don't have no fun.

1709
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:51,250
That is very low class of you.

[man snorting] Ah!

1778
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:55,166
[chuckles, clears throat]

1779
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:57,083
Hey, let me get this straight.

1780
01:18:57,166 --> 01:19:00,250
Every single person that you know
does coke, but you don't?

1781
01:19:02,083 --> 01:19:04,166
Yeah, it's crazy and upsetting.

1782
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:07,625
It's… It's driving us apart, honestly.

1783
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:11,708
I miss them the way they were, you know.

1784
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:15,875
Yo! Ezra!
Ezra, buddy, buddy. We're almost out.

1785
01:19:15,958 --> 01:19:19,541
So we need your guy's number.
So we need to call the coke guy.

1786
01:19:19,625 --> 01:19:22,750
Your guy, your coke guy.
Can we call him? Thank you.

1787
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:25,583
What guy? I don't have a guy!

1788
01:19:25,666 --> 01:19:27,625
Ez, what? You definitely have a guy.

1789
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:30,250
- You got a guy.
- The coke guy from Vegas from last time.

1790
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:31,750
Just call him. Quit holding out.

1791
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:34,875
I think you're so high on cocaine,
you don't know what you're saying.

1792
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:38,791
I don't have a coke guy.

1793
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:40,166
- [laughing]
- No. You have a guy.

1794
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,708
We bought cocaine from him.

1795
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:43,875
- He is a cocaine dealer.
- [man 2] Yeah.

1796
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:45,375
And we bought coke,

1797
01:19:45,458 --> 01:19:48,958
and you got so high that
you ended up passing out on the Strip.

1798
01:19:49,041 --> 01:19:50,750
You had cocaine all over your face.

1799
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:52,916
Wait, I think I remember you.

1800
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,333
You… You shit your pants last time.

1801
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:58,458
- Yes, you did! You shit your pants!
- [all laughing]

1802
01:19:58,541 --> 01:20:01,041
- From cocaine use! You did that.
- [mouths] Shut the fuck up.

1803
01:20:01,125 --> 01:20:03,875
Sniff, sniff, motherfuckers,
guess who I found.

1804
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:07,083
- [all] Coke guy!
- [Mo] Exactly! Ho-ho!

1805
01:20:07,166 --> 01:20:11,041
Ezra! Ezra,
that's the guy I was talking about.

1806
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:12,250
The coke guy!

1807
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:14,458
Look. Look, look at his knuckles.

1808
01:20:14,541 --> 01:20:16,875
Yeah, it says "Coke Guy"
right there on his knuckles.

1809
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:20,416
Ezra! Thank you for
the Edible Arrangement on my birthday.

1810
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,291
Such a mensch. For you, Papi.

1811
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:29,416
God damn. That's a lot
of cocaine you got there, Ezra.

1812
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:31,583
Yeah.

1813
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:35,625
Hey, you shit on yourself
last time you was here?

1814
01:20:36,958 --> 01:20:38,833
You shat your slacks?

1815
01:20:38,916 --> 01:20:41,041
Yes, but not from cocaine.

1816
01:20:41,125 --> 01:20:44,333
It was from… It was from Chipotle.

1817
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:47,250
- [chattering]
- [laughing]

1818
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:50,333
- I'm ready. I am ready!
- Oh!

1819
01:20:50,416 --> 01:20:53,375
- Seven letters. Plural.
- Yeah, right.

1820
01:20:53,458 --> 01:20:56,625
A group of people who move beautifully.

1821
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:59,458
Okay, you said plural, so there's an "s."

1822
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:00,541
- [mother] "S."
- Good.

1823
01:21:00,625 --> 01:21:02,833
- Oh, strippers! Strippers!
- [woman] Too many letters.

1824
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:03,958
[imitates buzzer]

1825
01:21:04,041 --> 01:21:06,916
Oh, wait. Oh, no, no, no, I've got it.

1826
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,666
Is it an "n" word?

1827
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:10,166
[mother exhales]

1828
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:13,875
[Shelley] No.

1829
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:17,125
No, no. I meant N-Navajos.

1830
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:19,583
- [woman] Oh, jeez.
- [Shelley] No, that's where I was going.

1831
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:21,541
Was Navajos, because, um…

1832
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:24,416
- You know, when they move, the Navajo...
- [Liza] Mom.

1833
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,000
Mom, please.

1834
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:26,916
[Shelley] What?

1835
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:31,541
- Oh. Dancers!
- [screaming]

1836
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:33,250
Oh, my God!

1837
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:34,291
What the hell!

1838
01:21:34,375 --> 01:21:35,958
What the hell is wrong with you?

1839
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:37,375
- [woman 1 shouts]
- [gasps]

1840
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:39,208
- [woman 2] Oh, my God!
- [shouts]

1841
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:40,750
[shouting]

1842
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:41,958
No, no!

1843
01:21:42,041 --> 01:21:43,708
[woman 2] It's okay.
Your braids look good.

1844
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:45,375
It's hooked onto my…

1845
01:21:45,458 --> 01:21:48,291
- It's okay. Somebody get her a wig.
- [chattering]

1846
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:50,916
- Did you know this was a wig?
- No, I… I didn't know that.

1847
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,750
I mean, this… this is kind of amazing
craftsmanship, don't you think? Because...

1848
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:57,500
- Gimme the girl's wig back. Gimme the wig.
- What...

1849
01:21:57,583 --> 01:21:59,458
- Now it's all tangled up.
- [woman 3] You're okay.

1850
01:21:59,541 --> 01:22:01,541
- [woman 1] Let's go!
- [woman 2] Okay.

1851
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,000
[woman 1] We out.

1852
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:04,291
What ha...

1853
01:22:05,458 --> 01:22:08,500
- [Ezra] Was your trip as bad as mine?
- [Amira] I guess you could say that.

1854
01:22:08,583 --> 01:22:10,208
[exhales] Yeah, mine was rough.

1855
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:13,125
Did your dad say anything?

1856
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:15,625
No. Why? Should he?

1857
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:18,916
No, just that, uh, everything went okay,

1858
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,750
and it was totally normal, so, yeah.

1859
01:22:23,375 --> 01:22:25,958
- Okay.
- Why was yours rough? 'Cause my mom?

1860
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:28,375
[Amira sighs] I don't wanna talk about it.

1861
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:29,916
[scoffs] What'd she do this time?

1862
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,750
Ezra, I don't...
I really don't wanna talk about it.

1863
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:34,291
Just tell me what she did.

1864
01:22:35,208 --> 01:22:39,625
[sighs] Okay, she pulled the same
tone-deaf shit she does all the time.

1865
01:22:39,708 --> 01:22:41,708
But that's what y'all do, so…

1866
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,416
What type of shit is that to say?

1867
01:22:46,583 --> 01:22:48,583
I'm sorry. I just got a lot on my mind.

1868
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:50,125
I'm sorry.

1869
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:54,375
[Ezra sighs] Okay.

1870
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:58,666
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

1871
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:01,541
- Throwing this shit away.
- Why?

1872
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:04,166
Because I didn't get the job, Ezra.
That's why.

1873
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:05,875
What?

1874
01:23:05,958 --> 01:23:09,583
The producer called me and told me
that he went with someone else.

1875
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:12,750
Someone who has more
period piece experience. I don't know.

1876
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:15,250
[Ezra] Baby, I'm sorry.

1877
01:23:15,333 --> 01:23:19,500
If it's any consolation,
I can hold you down for a while.

1878
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:22,916
[scoffs] No, Ezra,
I don't wanna be some kept woman.

1879
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:28,166
I'm just trying to think
of ways to help you, all right?

1880
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:30,666
Like… [sighs]

1881
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:31,750
- Let me...
- [Amira sighs]

1882
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:34,000
Let me call
my family friend Rick Greenwald.

1883
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:35,125
He's got connections,

1884
01:23:35,208 --> 01:23:37,083
and he'll look out
for you on your next job.

1885
01:23:37,166 --> 01:23:38,708
Oh, the fucking luxury.

1886
01:23:39,291 --> 01:23:42,041
Are you not listening to what I'm saying?
Are you not hearing me?

1887
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:43,875
Everything I have, I've gotten on my own.

1888
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:45,708
I've worked really hard for it

1889
01:23:45,791 --> 01:23:48,000
and worked through
all this racist bullshit,

1890
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:49,416
all for you to be able to come in

1891
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:52,041
and call your family friend
to give me a job

1892
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:54,291
I probably should have got five years ago?

1893
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:56,041
How do you think that makes me feel?

1894
01:23:56,916 --> 01:24:00,083
Well, I'm not trying to make you feel bad.
I'm just trying to, like, help.

1895
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:02,750
And it's okay to accept help
from someone who loves you.

1896
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:07,541
That's really easy for you to say because
that's how life has worked for you.

1897
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:09,083
That's not how it works for me.

1898
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:12,125
Whatever. We have to get ready
for this rehearsal dinner.

1899
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:14,208
I'm going to the bathroom. Alone.

1900
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:15,291
Please.

1901
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:19,583
Yeah, I don't wanna go
to the bathroom with you.

1902
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:21,083
[Amira] Since when?

1903
01:24:21,708 --> 01:24:23,291
My charger's in there though.

1904
01:24:24,416 --> 01:24:27,041
Let me just grab my charger
before you're in there for a while.

1905
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:28,083

Oh, man. Mama named you Woody.
I'm calling you Woody.

Anyway, I ain't no criminal, okay?

1921
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:22,166
It was a peeping Tom charge, okay?

1922
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:25,791
I was looking in there, peeping to see
if my baby mama was cheating,

1923
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:29,000
so I could get lower prices
on my child support.

1924
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:30,375
Why peep through the window?

1925
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:34,458
Because I wanted to see somebody
have her broke down over, like a shotgun.

1926
01:25:34,541 --> 01:25:36,250
That ain't gonna lower your child support.

1927
01:25:36,333 --> 01:25:39,208
The judge seen her being a ho,
my child support will go low.

1928
01:25:39,291 --> 01:25:41,875
Can't go up in the judge,
"I seen her bent over, Your Honor."

1929
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:42,916
"I should get less."

1930
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,458
[chuckles] The judge ain't gonna
give you less money.

1931
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:46,958
I've done it before.

1932
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:49,083

- [EJ] Hey, baby!

1933

Hey!

1934
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,791

- Ezra.

- This is my uncle.

1937

[EJ] Okay.

1938
01:26:00,791 --> 01:26:03,125
Yeah, this is Ezra. This is the man.

01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:08,208
Okay, I'm gonna go say what's up to Renee.

1941
01:26:08,291 --> 01:26:09,458
- [EJ] Yeah.
- Y'all be nice.

1942
01:26:09,541 --> 01:26:10,625
We'll be nice to Ezra.

1943
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:13,416
You gonna let this credit card sit here,
we gonna swipe him.

1944

[Amira laughs]

1945
01:26:14,416 --> 01:26:17,375
He look like an AmEx,
standing here with his hair slicked back.

1946
01:26:17,458 --> 01:26:19,333
- Oh. He lying.
- [chuckling]

1947
01:26:19,416 --> 01:26:20,958
- [laughs] All right.
- All right. Okay.

1948
01:26:21,041 --> 01:26:22,708
Come back soon if you want.

1949
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:26,625
- Ezra does a podcast on Black culture.
- Oh!

1950
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:28,958
Tell him, Ezra.

1951
01:26:29,041 --> 01:26:30,458
Yeah, I do podcasts.

1952
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:32,250
About what?

1953
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:33,875
The culture.

1954
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:36,708
Oh, you're gonna just say "culture"
and leave "Black" out?

1955
01:26:37,291 --> 01:26:40,458
[EJ laughs] You gotta get that money
some kind of way, baby, huh?

1956
01:26:40,541 --> 01:26:43,916
Give me $150 real quick.
Don't tell her I asked for the money.

1957
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,791
- I won't. I'll Venmo...
- Give me a Cîroc.

1958
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:49,583
And, uh, the white Barry White
something to drink.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
I got something to say.

1966
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,375
- I got something to say. Uh…
- [man] Okay, say it!

1967
01:27:08,458 --> 01:27:11,166
This is nice, y'all. This is real nice.

1968
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:14,583
I ain't never had
no, uh, wedding like this,

1969
01:27:14,666 --> 01:27:17,125
but I mean, I've been married three times.
That's right.

1970
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:19,125
Two times at the courthouse

1971
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:21,916
and then one time
at the Benihana's. [chuckles]

1972
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,083
We ain't had no reservations,
nothing like that.

1973
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:28,125
Amira, my cousin, I just wanna say
how happy I am for you and Ezra...

1974
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:31,833
Girl, we just wanna say congrats.
You marrying this white man.

1975
01:27:31,916 --> 01:27:34,166
- Girl, all these white people are here.
- [scoffs]

1976
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,375
If you like it, we love it,
right? [chuckles]

1977
01:27:37,458 --> 01:27:40,000
- I stormed the Capitol.
- [crowd gasps]

1978
01:27:40,083 --> 01:27:42,416
I did. I was there.

1979
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:45,208
Ezra tried to stop me.

1980
01:27:47,166 --> 01:27:49,375
He's a liberal cuck, but he's a good man.

1981
01:27:49,458 --> 01:27:52,791
To my best friend Ezra,
who's kind and thoughtful,

1982
01:27:53,375 --> 01:27:56,666
but for whatever reason didn't think
to sit me on the Black side of the table,

1983
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:59,791
which just aesthetically
makes sense, you know.

1984
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:04,208
Cheers to inclusion
and our newly found generational wealth.

1985
01:28:04,291 --> 01:28:06,916
"He left the family early, um,

1986
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,958
leaving his mother responsible
for everybody, including the house."

1988

1989
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:20,000

I wanna say it was Albuquerque.

- Okay. I think we can wrap it up. Yeah.
- I think.

That vaccine…

1993
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:32,666
makes you gay.

1994
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,541
So the moral of the story is

1995
01:28:34,625 --> 01:28:37,458
never date a woman
who don't respect your wife.

1999
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:54,416
Can I have everybody's attention, please?

2000
01:28:55,166 --> 01:28:56,375
Attention, everyone.

2001
01:28:57,125 --> 01:28:58,625
Yeah, I know it's, uh,

2002
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:01,791
it's customary for the father
to give a speech on the wedding day.

2003
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:06,458
But I thought there was some things
that I needed to, uh, address tonight.

2004
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,583
Um,

2005
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:10,833
when a man's daughter gets married,

2006
01:29:11,916 --> 01:29:14,500
they say that the man is giving her away.

2007
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:18,375
Now, that's a really hard pill to swallow.

2008
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,000
Because you don't usually know

2009
01:29:21,083 --> 01:29:23,958
who the man is
that you're giving your daughter away to.

2010
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:25,916
Usually.

2011
01:29:27,708 --> 01:29:29,291
But I consider myself fortunate,

2012
01:29:29,375 --> 01:29:32,500
because I think
I kind of do know who Ezra is.

2013

[mother chuckles]

2014
01:29:34,083 --> 01:29:39,916
And he's not a drunken, drugged-out,
dream-chasing whore monger

2015
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:44,375
who surrounds himself
with a bunch of, uh, racist degenerates.

2017

Hey.

Oh, Ezra.

2028
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:34,916
Thank you for,
uh, what you did back there.

2029
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,583
What did I do back there?

2030
01:30:38,416 --> 01:30:39,333
Your speech.

2031
01:30:39,416 --> 01:30:42,416
You could've, uh,
could've blown up my spot.

2032
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:43,958
You didn't, so thanks.

2033
01:30:44,041 --> 01:30:47,166
Well, save your thank you,
'cause I didn't do it for you.

2034
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:48,958
I did that for my daughter.

2035
01:30:49,041 --> 01:30:51,791
You think I'm gonna embarrass her
in front of her whole family?

2036
01:30:52,458 --> 01:30:53,375
No.

2037
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:56,708
You don't know me too well.

2038
01:30:58,291 --> 01:31:00,791
But here's the thing. I know you.

2039
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:03,750
I've known you from the very start.

2040
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:05,750
I had your number from day one.

2041
01:31:06,875 --> 01:31:07,875
And for the life of me,

2042
01:31:07,958 --> 01:31:11,458
I do not know why my daughter
continues to go down this path with you.

2043
01:31:12,041 --> 01:31:14,208
There's one thing
that I'm crystal clear on,

2044
01:31:14,291 --> 01:31:20,666
is that you are absolutely,
positively, unequivocally

2045
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,958
not the right the guy for my daughter.

2046
01:31:24,583 --> 01:31:25,583
Period.

2047
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:27,750
- Why?
- Excuse me.

2048
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:29,958
Why am I not
the right guy for your daughter?

2049
01:31:30,041 --> 01:31:31,791
Well, shit, where do I begin?

2050
01:31:31,875 --> 01:31:32,708
Anywhere.

2051
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:36,708
Well, what… what about
we start at your bachelor party?

2052
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:39,250
When I saw you in the room
with the strippers and the cocaine,

2053
01:31:39,333 --> 01:31:40,750
how about we start there?

2054
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:41,916
Why don't we start with

2055
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,250
why you were at my bachelor party
in the first place?

2056
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:46,166
You had no right to be there.

2057
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,958
Bachelor parties are
for people to be weird.

2058
01:31:48,041 --> 01:31:49,500
That's not who I am.

2059
01:31:49,583 --> 01:31:51,416
Okay? It's my dumb fucking friends.

2060
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:54,375
But you deeboed your way in,
and you got what you wanted.

2061
01:31:54,458 --> 01:31:55,916
I had a shitty time.

2062
01:31:56,708 --> 01:32:00,500
As a matter of fact, I have a shitty time
whenever you're around.

2063
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:03,500
You're like the cooler to my life,
and I don't know why.

2064
01:32:04,083 --> 01:32:07,125
Because the truth is all I've ever done

2065
01:32:08,541 --> 01:32:10,041
is love your daughter,

2066
01:32:10,583 --> 01:32:12,708
wholly and completely.

2067
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,083
And she loves me,

2068
01:32:15,166 --> 01:32:17,083
and we wanna marry each other.

2069
01:32:17,166 --> 01:32:20,208
And you just decided
before you even met me

2070
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:21,791
that you hated me.

2071
01:32:22,416 --> 01:32:24,625
[scoffs] And then once you met me,
you put all your energy

2072
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:26,958
just towards, like, smoking me out

2073
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:29,500
or trying to prove
I don't belong around Black people,

2074
01:32:29,583 --> 01:32:32,041
or that I'm a researcher
and not a witness.

2075
01:32:32,666 --> 01:32:35,583
That's why you brought me
to play ball at that park.

2076
01:32:35,666 --> 01:32:37,291
Why you brought me to that Crip barbershop

2077
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:39,208
while I'm wearing a red hoodie
like an idiot.

2078
01:32:39,291 --> 01:32:43,125
It's why you fuck with me about my podcast
and my music taste and how I talk

2079
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:44,916
and how I think and who my friends are

2080
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,125
and basically
everything that I'm a part of.

2081
01:32:48,166 --> 01:32:50,333
And I just take it. I take it!

2082
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:52,833
I take your shit. I take it all day.

2083
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:56,541
And it did teach me one thing
that you were right about.

2084
01:32:56,625 --> 01:32:57,583
[Akbar] And what's that?

2085
01:32:58,166 --> 01:33:02,166
I will never, ever, ever

2086
01:33:03,291 --> 01:33:06,125
know what it's like
to be a Black person in this country.

2087
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:09,500
But I do know what an asshole is.

2088
01:33:17,875 --> 01:33:19,291
Yeah, yeah, I know.

2089
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:22,666
I'm really pleased with the way...
And they're such a nice group of...

2090
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:26,083
Oh, Amira! Amira. Hi!

2091
01:33:26,166 --> 01:33:28,083
Would you excuse me for just a second?

2092
01:33:28,166 --> 01:33:30,083
- Oh, my gosh!
- [Amira] Hi.

2093
01:33:30,166 --> 01:33:32,500
Hi! I just wanted to stop you

2094
01:33:32,583 --> 01:33:34,583
and tell you
that I think you look so pretty.

2095
01:33:34,666 --> 01:33:35,750
Thank you.

2096
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:37,625
Is that a roller set?

2097
01:33:37,708 --> 01:33:40,666
- Hmm?
- Your hair. Is it a roller set?

2098
01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:43,666
Um, no, it's not.

2099
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:48,708
Oh. Shoot. Okay.
It's not individuals, right?

2100
01:33:48,791 --> 01:33:49,750
[Amira] No.

2101
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:52,291
No? Okay. Shit.

2102
01:33:52,375 --> 01:33:55,416
All right, well, I guess I'm gonna
have to go back to the drawing board.

2103
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:58,000
I, uh... Ever since the bachelorette party…

2104
01:33:58,083 --> 01:33:58,916
[Amira] Mm-hmm.

2105
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,708
…I just did this really deep dive
on Black women's hair.

2106
01:34:02,791 --> 01:34:06,583
And, um, oh, for example,
I watched the Chris Rock documentary.

2107
01:34:06,666 --> 01:34:10,041
I don't know if you've had a chance
to see it. It's absolutely fantastic.

2108
01:34:10,125 --> 01:34:11,458
And he's so funny.

2109
01:34:11,541 --> 01:34:13,916
There's something about his voice
that always makes me laugh.

2110
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,916
But anyway, there's nothing funny
about Black women's hair, you know.

2111
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,833
I mean, my God, I just had no idea.

2112
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:22,875
I mean, it really blew my mind.

2113
01:34:22,958 --> 01:34:25,458
You know, the energy and the time

2114
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:29,750
and the… the pain and the suffering
that Black women go through.

2115
01:34:29,833 --> 01:34:33,000
And so, anyway,
I just wanted to be well-versed

2116
01:34:33,083 --> 01:34:36,125
for when I saw you next,
and I'll let you get back to it.

2117
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:39,333
Yeah, and... but before you go,
can you just tell me…

2118
01:34:39,958 --> 01:34:42,666
[exhales] What is this style?
Just so I know for next time.

2119
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:44,833
- Shelley, I'm not a toy.
- [Shelley] Because I...

2120
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:46,500
Hmm?

2121
01:34:46,583 --> 01:34:49,500
I really don't appreciate you treating me

2122
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:53,083
like some shiny little object
you can show off to your friends.

2123
01:34:53,166 --> 01:34:54,916
Oh, no,
I would never do anything like that.

2124
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,083
- [Amira] No, you are.
- No...

2125
01:34:56,166 --> 01:34:58,750
- [Amira] Just let me finish. Yes, you do.
- Oh, no, I...

2126
01:34:58,833 --> 01:35:02,458
Since I met you,
I've been nothing but kind and respectful.

2127
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:03,791
And it's starting to feel like

2128
01:35:03,875 --> 01:35:06,416
you're all happy
that you have this Black daughter-in-law

2129
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,041
now that it's cool
to care about Black people.

2130
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,083
I bet every time we hang out,
you tell one of your friends,

2131
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:15,666
and I can guarantee you
that what you don't tell them

2132
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:17,250
is that every time we hang out,

2133
01:35:17,333 --> 01:35:21,875
you are wildly offensive
and incredibly inappropriate.

2134
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,583
- Well, I'm not...
- [Amira] Oh, and now you're gonna cry.

2135
01:35:25,666 --> 01:35:27,708
You're gonna clutch your pearls
and play the victim

2136
01:35:27,791 --> 01:35:30,083
as if everything I just said,
none of that was valid.

2137
01:35:30,166 --> 01:35:31,875
My feelings are not valid.

2138
01:35:31,958 --> 01:35:33,291
Your feelings are hurt.

2139
01:35:33,375 --> 01:35:35,250
- Am I being too aggressive with you?
- [splutters]

2140
01:35:35,333 --> 01:35:37,000
[Amira] Am I giving you "angry"?

2141
01:35:38,083 --> 01:35:41,708
The crazy thing is that I really
genuinely wanted to get to know you,

2142
01:35:41,791 --> 01:35:42,750
woman to woman.

2143
01:35:42,833 --> 01:35:44,250
I thought you would see me.

2144
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:46,833
- That's what I...
- [Amira] No, it's not.

2145
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:49,625
Because you can't just see me for me.

2146
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:51,708
It doesn't matter how many books you read

2147
01:35:51,791 --> 01:35:54,333
or how many documentaries that you watch,

2148
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:57,750
because at the end of the day,
I won't just be Amira to you.

2149
01:35:57,833 --> 01:36:01,041
I'll always be Amira,
the Black token daughter-in-law,

2150
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:02,541
and that's ignorant.

2151
01:36:03,375 --> 01:36:05,125
Amira, are you okay?

2152
01:36:05,208 --> 01:36:06,041
Not really.

2153
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,500
- Miss Shelley, are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

2154
01:36:10,125 --> 01:36:13,250
All right. Uh, Amira, honey.

2155
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:17,666
[sniffles]

2156
01:36:21,833 --> 01:36:23,583
[both] Can I talk to you for a second?

2157
01:36:23,666 --> 01:36:24,583
Yes.

2158
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:30,375
[gasps] You wanna go first?

2159
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:34,958
- I do, but it sounds like you do too.
- I do. [exhales]

2160
01:36:38,625 --> 01:36:39,625
Ezra…

2161
01:36:44,166 --> 01:36:46,916
I don't know how this is gonna work.

2162
01:36:49,541 --> 01:36:50,375
Okay.

2163
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:52,375
[Amira] It's just…

2164
01:36:53,583 --> 01:36:56,208
You know, your family,

2165
01:36:56,291 --> 01:36:59,166
my family, the whole thing,

2166
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:02,958
I don't know
if it's supposed to be this hard,

2167
01:37:03,041 --> 01:37:05,291
and if I'm being honest, I just…

2168
01:37:06,208 --> 01:37:08,416
Oh, God, I don't have it in me.

2169
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,416
I'm so sorry.

2170
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:19,125
[Ezra sighs]

2171
01:37:21,875 --> 01:37:23,500
Uh, I don't disagree.

2172
01:37:26,083 --> 01:37:28,458
The stuff with our families, like…

2173
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:32,083
my mom, your dad.

2174
01:37:33,833 --> 01:37:36,375
Yeah, I guess I don't see it changing, so…

2175
01:37:40,083 --> 01:37:43,250
I do, uh, I do want you to know that,

2176
01:37:44,375 --> 01:37:48,500
uh, this time with you has been,
like, the happiest time of my life, so…

2177
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:57,583
I feel the same way. [sobs]

2178
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:08,375
Okay.

2179

[Mo] Anyways, what did I say

2188
01:38:46,166 --> 01:38:49,250
that's been profoundly
rattling around in your consciousness?

2189
01:38:49,333 --> 01:38:52,125
You said that Black people
and white people could never be cool,

2190
01:38:52,208 --> 01:38:53,708
and I think you're right.

2191
01:38:53,791 --> 01:38:56,416
[scoffs] Yeah, bro, of course I was right.

2192

Him and his friends, the degenerates,
was doing so much cocaine in Vegas,

they was doing a reboot of <i>Scarface.</i>

Yes, that's one of the main reasons.
Yes, cocaine.

- No, I ain't see him shit on hisself.

2258

that you accept my apology,
