--[sighs] Well, unfortunately,
without any known relatives,

we can't keep you together.

50
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:39,079
So after we pick up your things,
I'll be dropping Brock off

51
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,551
at, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Fliegal's.

52
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:44,818
And Kerra, I'm
afraid you're going

00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,420
to have to spend the
night at the Center.

I can take care of Brock.
I've been taking care of him.

-The law is clear, Kerra.

57
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:52,926
You're not old enough
to be his guardian.

58
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:56,364
And considering the
matter your mother died--

59
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:58,131
-I don't do drugs, Mr. Paulson.

60
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,400
That was my mother, not me.

61
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,034
-It's the environment.

62
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,704
And where Brock already
has a juvenile record--

63
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,806
-Then we'll move.
I'll get a job.

64

-I'm not sure you're
ready for any of that.

have, eh, no idea

68
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,749
how to contact your father.
-Father left when I was five.

69
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,618
Brock doesn't even remember it.
-Well, I'm sorry, Kerra.

70
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:20,521
Maybe-- maybe in the
future we can arrange

71
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,223
for a-- a permanent
household together.

72
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:29,963

-We'll probably
be a little while,

78
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:52,920
so just meet us back here later.

79
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,890
-All right, I will
give you, uh, one hour.

80

00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:11,572
-Does it matter?

85
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:12,973
-I don't want to go.

00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:13,874
-You're going.

87
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,108

-Don't you get it?

89
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,579
You're going to a foster home.

90
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,714
You're not going to see
them any way, or me.

91
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,684
Is that what you want,
for them to separate us?

92
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:26,654
Cause that's what'll
happen, maybe forever.

93
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:30,257

I--

108
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:00,888
-OK, because I need you to
take care of something for me.

00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:01,855
-Oh-- OK, well, what's in it?

-Never mind.

111
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,758
And no peaking, got it?
-Sure, Spree.

112
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,261
But, I mean, we're--
we're leaving tonight.

get to wherever you're going.

didn't think you
had it in you, sis.

So proud.

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,662
-You get your hands off my car.

182
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:55,829
[laughs]

183
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,597
-Always tripping, mami.

184
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,499
That's no way to be
talking to your guardian

185
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:02,235
angel, such a pretty thing.

186
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,571
Sometime you may be needing
a little protection.

187
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,406
-Don't!
-Hey!

188
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,607
I touch what I want when I want.

189
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,276
You're in my
neighborhood now, mami.

190
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,912
OK?
Ah!

191
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,380
GANG MEMBER (COCKING
GUN): Lemme cap em!

192
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,316
-Oy!
Hey!

193
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,351
BROCK (LAUGHING): I can't
believe you did that.

194
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,520
[music playing]

195
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,429
Are you gonna tell me
where we're going now?

196
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,064
-Utah.
-Utah?

197
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,266
What's in Utah?
-Relatives.

198
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,273
-I thought you said we
didn't have any relatives.

199
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,475
-Yeah, well, these are
from-- from our dad's side

200
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,311
of the family.
-Our dad's side?

201
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,947
-I haven't seen em since
I was like five or six.

202
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,581
-You've got to be kidding.
Why in the--

203
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,050
-Don't use that
kind of language.

204
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,484
[sigh] It's just a visit.

205
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,753
It's not permanent.

206
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,454
Besides, they
might even help us.

207
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,856
-Help us how?

208
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,624
And besides, you use that
language all the time.

209
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:58,591
-Not anymore.

210
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,760
-Since when?

211
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,094
-Since I started
taking care of you.

212
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,934
-Don't say it.

213
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,702
-I wasn't.
-Don't say it!

214
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:15,809
-I wasn't!

215
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,010
-How can these people help us?

216
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,746
I've never even heard of them.

217
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,180
How come we've never met them?

218
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,514
-That's cause mom
didn't like them.

219
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,550
They're Mormons.

220
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,252
-Weird.

221
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,020
-Look, they're the only
relatives we've got,

222
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,623
and our only hope until I figure
out what we're going to do.

223
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,025
I don't want you
making fun of them.

224
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,226
-Me?

225
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,862
How could you think
I'd do such a thing?

226
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,144

229
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,975
-Yep, this is it.

230
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:27,114
-I've never seen a
town this small before.

231
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,087
You've got to be kidding me.

232
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,364
Are you sure you're not lost?
-I'm not lost.

233
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,949
BROCK: They grow on trees?

234
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:05,418
[car noises] What--
what was that?

235
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,820

[brakes screeching]

237
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,923
BROCK: What's wrong?

238
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,525
-I thought I saw something.

239
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,626
BROCK: Saw what?

240
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,428
KERRA: I don't know.

241
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,696
-Bigfoot?

242
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,098
No, Sasquatch?

243
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:54,134
Oh, wait, I forgot,
Sasquatch is in California.

244
00:13:54,134 --> 00:14:00,974
KID (SHOUTING): Someone's here!

245
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:03,576
Someone's here!

246
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,945
Someone's here!

247
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:05,946
Someone's here!

248
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,547
Someone's here!

00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,029
-Gracious.

252
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,864
Are you kids lost?

253
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,066
-Hello, Aunt Corrine.

254
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,771
I'm Kerra.

255
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,907
I'm your niece.

256
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,910
-Kerra?

257
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,111
Oh my word.

258
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:45,986
Oh my word, Kerra.

259
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:48,621
-Did she just say that
she was my cousin?

260
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:52,025
-Yeah, too bad for you.

261
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,393
[cat meowing]

262
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,497
-Um, our mom got a
new job in Florida,

263
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:00,267
so Brock and I are on our
way there to join her.

264
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,569
-You're traveling by yourselves?

265
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,603
-Sure, yeah.

266
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,038
I mean, we do it all the time.

267
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,007
-All the time.

268
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,076
-Well, that's just fine.

269
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,978
Looks like you'll
be a few days late.

270
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:12,379
I'll have Sklyar
look at your car.

271
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,214
If he can't fix it, we
may have to go into town.

272
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:18,118
-If I can't fix it,
nobody can fix it.

273
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,253
-When is your mother
expecting you?

274
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,689
-A few weeks.
-Weeks.

275
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:23,623
-A few weeks?

276
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:24,958
-Uh, days.

277
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,526
I meant days.

278
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,496
-Days.

279
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,198
-I see.

280
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:33,633
Well, tonight
you're staying here.

281
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,835
Skyler, why don't you help
bring in their luggage?

282
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,541
-Remember me, Natasha?

283
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,542
[laughs]

284
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,077
-I do remember you.

285
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,413
-How about me, Cherylynn?

286
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,647
-Cherylynn?

287
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,282
I think last time I saw
you, you were a baby.

288
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,285
-Why don't you girls show
Kerra where she'll be sleeping.

289
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,354
I'll go get your uncle
from the orchard.

290
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,389
Tessa, you watch
the banana bread.

291
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,558
Kolter, Soriah, get
the cats off the table.

292
00:15:58,558 --> 00:15:59,926
Come on, baby girl.

293
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,428
Let's go get daddy.

[baby mumbling]

295
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,864
Yes, we get the cats
off the table, huh?

296
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,000
[meows]

297
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,001
-Where do you want it?

298
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,137
-Oh, here, she can have my bed.

299
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,304
-Oh, no, that's all right.

300
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,639
I'm fine over here.
[giggling] Sure

301
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,807
got bigger since I
saw you last, Skyler.

302
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,276
-Yeah, so have you.

303
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:19,179
Hey, I got a friend that
would really like to meet you.

304
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,547
In fact, I've got
a lot of friends

305
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:21,981
that would probably like to--
-Oh, not now.

306
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,683
--meet you.
But--

307
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,885
[laughing]

308
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,320
Oh, Kerra.

309
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,655
Mmm.

310
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,523
I can't believe you're here.
You're so beautiful.

311
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,992
-Oh, that is not true.
-Oh, don't even,

312
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,294
-Do you have a
lot of boyfriends?

313
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,728
-No, no boyfriends.

314
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,530
-Oh, you have to tell us
everything about California.

315
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,068
-Do you know any movie stars?
-Hey, I'm asking the questions.

316
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,035
Do you know any movie stars?

317
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,336
-Afraid not, heh.

318
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,305
-Hey, do you still talk
to that Donnie kid?

319
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:48,275
-Who?

320
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,410
-Kid Donnie, your
imaginary friend.

321
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,312
Oh, that's what I
remember most about you.

322
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:54,414
You used to spend
hours talking to him.

323
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,549
-No, I made all that up.
-Well, duh.

324
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,586
It's not like I thought
you believed he was real.

325
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:00,953
-Like Donnie the kid?

326
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,355
Was he a cowboy?

327
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,192
-Uh, no, he was a boy, a
magical boy, right Kerra?

328
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:08,861
Oh, I'm sorry.

329
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,331
Did I make you uncomfortable?
-No, it's fine.

330
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,466
It's just-- it's just
been such a long time

331
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,403
since I thought
about any of that.

332
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,037
It used to make people upset.

333
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,239
-(LAUGHING) No way.

334
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,840
I thought it was wonderful.

335
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,776
It made me want my own imaginary
friend, someone to play with me

336
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,945
and protect me like yours did.

337
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,614
Meh, didn't really matter.

338
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:30,250
I got frightened anyway.
-Frightened?

339
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,152
What frightened you?
The usual.

340
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,287
Dark closets,
bumps in the night.

341
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,788
-The whistlers.
-Whistlers?

342
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,590
-Cherylynn, you don't know
what you're talking about.

343
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,126
You haven't heard a
whistler in your life.

344
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:40,793
-I have so.
-She's lying.

345
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,463
No one's heard them in
practically forever.

346
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:44,297
-No, no.

347
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,733
I remember, the whistlers.

348
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,937
It's been so long.

349
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,672
You really don't
hear them anymore?

350
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:56,176
--[sighs] No, not since
I was really little.

351
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,577
Mom doesn't like us
to talk about it.

352
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,446
-She says it scares
the little kids.

353
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,181
-She says it's the wind
blowing through the hollow

354
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,383
just right, like
holes in a flute.

355
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,285
-Yeah, but why did it stop?

356
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,919
-No one knows.
-So you heard them?

357
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,156
What did they sound like?
-You just said you'd heard them.

358
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,490
-Well, I did.

359
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,426
I was just-- OK, so I
never heard them, heh.

360
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,228
-Yeah, that's what I thought.

361
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:18,198
-Sometimes at night or--
or in the early morning,

362
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:23,370
I'd hear, like,
whispers or a humming.

363
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,572
-Grandpa Lee says the
hollow is full of ghosts.

364
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:28,808
-Cherylynn-- great, five minutes
in this house and she already

365
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,109
thinks we're a bunch of wackos.

366
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,211
-I used to play
in those woods all

367
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,480
the time when I
was a little girl.

368
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,747
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

369
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,816
-Heh, that's amazing,
because none of us

370
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,319
will play in there for anything.

371
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,721
Are you sure you've never
seen any movie stars?

372
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,997
-You have a Slifer
the Sky Dragon?

373
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,865
-It came in the original pack.

374
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,634
My mom only bought me one.

375
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,768
-One pack?

376
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,103
And it had this?

377
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,671
-Is it a good one?

378
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,107
-Oh, well, uh, n--
not-- not really.

379
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,142
I mean-- I have better ones.

380
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,878
Maybe later we could,
uh-- make a trade?

381
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,113
SORIAH: Daddy!
Daddy!

382
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,047
Daddy!

383
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,350
-Well, hello--

384
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,851
-I am Soriah.

385
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,853
-Oh, yes.

386
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,121
Soriah, my little one.

387
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,423
Oh, I love you.

388
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:18,791
-I love you, I love
you, I love you, too.

389
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,127
-Oh-- [laughs]

390
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,929
-I'm Tessa.
-Tessa!

391
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,731
Hello!

392
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,766
-Honey, this is Brock.

393
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:27,900
-Brock, my boy!

394
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,369
How are ya?

395
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,371
-No, honey, Brock's your nephew.

396
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,740
He's, uh, Chris's boy.

397
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,807
Chris and Delia.

398
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,176
You remember Delia,
from California?

399
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,146
-Delia, of course.

400
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:43,483
[bell rings] Is that
banana bread I smell?

401
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,953
TESSA: I left the other loaf
in because this one came out

402
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:48,054
doughy.

403
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,223
-Kerra's here, dad!

404
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,992
-Oh, well, hello, Kerra.

405
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,327
-Hello, Uncle Drew.

406
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:56,128
-Kerra is Brock's sister.

407
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,230
She's your niece.

408
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,565
-Well, that's wonderful!

409
00:19:58,565 --> 00:19:59,432
Welcome!

410
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,067
Are you staying for dinner?

411
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,369
-They're both
staying for dinner.

412
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,803
They're both staying
for a couple of days.

413
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,137
-Oh, fantastic.

414
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,173
Mi casa es su casa.
That's Spanish.

415
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,775
Do you know what that means?
-Yeah, actually.

416
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:12,111
-It means that my
house is your house.

417
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,413
Although, I'd
appreciate it if you--

418
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:14,881
-(DAUGHTER AND DAD)
left the family china.

419
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,183
[dad chuckles]

420
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,751
-(WHISPERING) What's
wrong with him?

421
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,787
-(WHISPERING) Later.

422
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,322
-(WHISPERING) It's
your turn, Soriah.

423
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:25,458
-Dear heavenly father,
thank you for this day,

424
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,495
for making my horsies
and my Barbies--

425
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:29,596
TESSA: Bless the food.

426
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:32,432
-Not yet.

427
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,402
And for Brock and--
what was her name?

428
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,404
TESSA (WHISPERING): Kerra.
-and for Kerra.

429
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,606
Hope they visit us again.

430
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:43,009
Hope that we can set a good
example like mommy says.

431
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,345
Hope their car gets better.

432
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,046
Hope that we don't
find out they're

433
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,548
in trouble with the law.

434
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:53,353
And bless the food by the
name of Jesus Christ, amen.

435
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:58,658
-(ALL) Amen.

436
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,393
-Pass the cucumbers, please.

437
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,098
Thank you.

438
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,199
-I can't take it, Kerra.

439
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,401
What's wrong with these people?

440
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,969
What's wrong with the Dad?

441
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,772
-Uncle Drew was injured, same
summer our parents split up.

442
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,174
It was an accident
in a machine shop.

443
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,076
A metal rod hit him, something--

444
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,244
-So is he like a zombie?

445
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,912
-(LAUGHING) Of course not.

446
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,414
He still runs a big farm.

447
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:25,318
Peaches, almonds, watermelon--
it just affected his memory.

448
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:27,654
-I think it's weird,
wigged-out, schizoid.

449
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,456
This whole family is schizoid.

450
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:30,823
-Don't sweat it.

451
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,392
We won't stay long.
-They know something's up.

452
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:33,426
They'll turn us in.

453
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:34,727
-I don't think so.

454
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:35,995
And besides, we've got
nowhere else to go.

455
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:36,829
-I'll steal another car.

456
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:37,597
-No.

457
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:38,698
No more of that, ever.

458
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:40,533
-I want to go home.
-To what, Brock?

459
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,836
There's nothing for us there.

460
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:47,674
-Ah, I guess we should
call their mother.

461
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:48,441
-Who?

462
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:51,110
Call whose mother?

463
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,980
-Kerra and Brock's.

464
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,516
They say she doesn't
have a phone yet.

465
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:58,518
Even if I could call her--

466
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,019
-What do you mean?

467
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,655
Why couldn't you?

468
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:06,359
-I don't know, I-- I don't
want to muddy the waters.

469
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,697
I want to enjoy my niece
and nephew while I can.

470
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:12,599
-You still blame her, don't you?

471
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,437
-I guess I do.

472
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:20,573
I do blame Delia.

473
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:22,475
My brother didn't
abandon his family.

474
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:24,544
You know that.

475
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:27,179
-Well, Corrine, we
never had any proof.

476
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,516
-She did it, Drew.

477
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,117
Or if not, she knows who did.

478
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:38,525
She got away with murder.
All these years--

479
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,564
[music playing]

480
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:47,166
[birds chirping]

481
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,713
[chimes]

482
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:07,647
[laughter]

483
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,943
-A lot has changed.

484
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:40,112
10 years ago a flash
flood washed through here.

485
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,748
That's when it stopped.

486
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:43,049
-You're Grandpa Lee.

487
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,250
-Yep.

488
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,986
And you must be, Sakura,
the little girl who

489
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,422
used to live in these woods
like a woodland fairy princess.

490
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,524
-You frightened me.

491
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:53,860
-(LAUGHIN) Oh, I do that a lot.

492
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,996
Your grandmother told me I did
that to her all of the time.

493
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:57,930
God rest her.

494
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,365
I was coming down the driveway.

495
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,601
I saw you enter the woods.

496
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,903
I figured this was
where you were headed.

497
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:06,205
-No one's called me
Sakura in forever.

498
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,807
-Ah, your father named you that.

499
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:11,177
Little cherry blossom,
Japanese, I think.

500
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,079
-So how did you know this
is where I'd be headed?

501
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,914
-'Cause I was
usually the one that

502
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:16,883
was sent out to search for you.

503
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:18,885
And I found you
here more than once.

504
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:20,953
-What did you mean,
that's when it stopped?

505
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,388
What stopped?

506
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:28,360
-Oh, the sound of the whistlers,
the shadows that flicked,

507
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:35,602
scurried through the woods,
voices and spirits of the dead.

508
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:37,737
Floods a few years
back must have

509
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:41,173
thrown things out
of kilter some how.

510
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:42,642
-I don't understand.

511
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:47,446
-That's cause I'm trying to make
it sound as spooky as I can.

512
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:50,216
How am I doing?

513
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,251
[shrieks]

514
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:55,788
[laughing]

515
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:03,696
-I remember sitting here for
hours when I was a little girl,

516
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:07,967
watching you carve your
violins or mixing up your,

517
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:11,771
uh, secret recipes
for amber varnish.

518
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:14,373
-I've got something to show you.

519
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:26,018
My master creation.

520
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,486
I did it!

521
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:32,024
The great ones would be so
proud, Veneri, Amati, even old

522
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:33,359
Stradivarius.

523
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:39,598
That's his varnish, lost
to the world for 300 years!

524
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,001
Want to know the secret?

525
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:43,169
-What?

526
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:45,905
-(WHISPERING) Look
right-- right here.

527
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:47,874
-"Holiness To The Lord."

528
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:51,243
-Heh, just giving credit
where credit is due.

529
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:04,090
[violin music]

530
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,179
-That's beautiful.

531
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,480
-Think so?

532
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,783
-One of the most beautiful
sounds I've ever heard.

533
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:35,021
-Most folks would say
it's just another violin.

534
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:38,858
But you, Kerra,
you have the gift.

535
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:41,360
You always did, even
when you were little.

536
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,264
You could hear things, feel
things few others could.

537
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:50,036
And it's that gift that
draws you into those woods.

538
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:52,805
-You think I'm drawn
there because of a gift?

539
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:57,977
-These woods are a very special
place, an ancient place.

540
00:27:57,977 --> 00:27:59,478
The Indians knew it.

541
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:01,480
They were still coming here
to pray when I was a kid.

542
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,314
[sighs]

543
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,783
I can't explain it.

544
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:06,753
Maybe it's the fault line
that runs through here,

545
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:09,155
or a combination of things.

546
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:13,125
But it's all pulled
together right there,

547
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,862
everything that's ever
happened on this continent--

548
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:18,664
history, voices--

549
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:24,070
Prophets have said this land
was once home to a noble people.

[scoffs]

551
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:27,473
But you can feel it, too, right?

552
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:32,779
You can feel their presence
like echoes in time.

553
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,983
Ooh, sometimes I
can feel it, too.

554
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:40,352
-I'd better be going.

555
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:42,688
Thanks for the cocoa.

556
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:46,025
[door opens]
It is beautiful.

557
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:54,266
-Sometimes I can feel it, too.

558
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,906

00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:11,784
-He's not in here.

561
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:12,819
Where you going, Spree!?

562
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:13,786
-(STRUGGLING) Come here!

563
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:14,787
-Where you going?

564
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:17,356
-Come on.
Stand up.

565
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:18,324
Hitch is here.

566
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:20,326
[chuckling]

567
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:21,360
-Hey.

568
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,594
-Where is it, holmes?

569
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,230
-Where's what?
What are you talking about?

570
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,332
-You must think I'm
pretty stupid, huh?

571
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:27,433
Hm?
Huh?

572
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,400
You think I'm stupid?

573
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,902
Huh?
Huh!?

574
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:31,337
Well, you disappoint me.

575
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:32,271
You disappoint me.

576
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,172

577
00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:34,807
[cackles]
-Hey, wait.

578
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:36,142
Wait, wait, Hitch, wait.

579
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:37,343
-You like that, vato?
-I gave it to the kid.

580
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:38,945
The kid's got it.
The kid's got it.

581
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:39,846
-Where's the kid?
-I don't know where the kid is!

582
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:40,612
-The kid is gone, huh!?

583
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,747
-He left town.

584
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:42,915
He's supposed to
call me any time.

585
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:44,050
I swear, he's
supposed to call me.

586
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:44,884
-When is he supposed
to call you?

587
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:45,918
-Any time, Hitch.

588
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:49,221
Hitch, Hitch, any time, Hitch.

589
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:50,990
-OK, you're going to
need a new alternator

590
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,859
and a new carburetor.

591
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:54,861
-Heh, maybe a respirator?

592
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:55,928
[laughs]

593
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:58,630
-What, is it expensive?

594
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,598
-(LAUGHING) Yeah.

595
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:04,303
[phone ringing]
-Hello?

596
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,638
PAULSON (ON PHONE):
Mrs. Whitman?

597
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,040
-Speaking.

598
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,475
PAULSON (ON PHONE): Uh,
my name is Carson Paulson.

599
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:12,011
I'm with the California
Welfare and Family Services.

600
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:13,779
We're looking for
your niece and nephew,

601
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,314
Kerra and Brock McConnell.

602
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,516
Your name wasn't
listed in their files,

603
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,118
but we did some digging and--

604
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:20,586
-Are they in trouble?

605
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:22,521
PAULSON (ON PHONE): Uh, yes.

606
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,056
I-- I'm afraid so.

607
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:27,126
They stole a car, Mrs.
Whitman, and, uh-- uh,

608
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,294
escaped our custody.

609
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:29,628
There's a-- there's
a warrant out.

610
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,263
Now, I know the
children are upset

611
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,298
since their mother's death.

612
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:34,500
But these are serious charges.

613
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,902
-Delia's dead?

614
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:37,403
PAULSON (ON PHONE): Y-- yes.

615
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:40,006
I-- oh, I'm sorry.

616
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:41,874
I thought sure you'd--

617
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:43,142
[sighs]

618
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:44,576
The children were in
the state's custody.

619
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:47,213
And I just hoped maybe you'd
seen or heard from them.

620
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:48,380
It-- it's possible that--

621
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,715
-I have to go.

622
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:51,417
PAULSON (ON PHONE):
Mrs. Whitman?

623
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:55,621
Mrs.--

624
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:59,158
[kids playing]

625
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:12,804
CORRINE: Hey.

626
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,374
-Thought he'd forgotten
how to be a kid.

627
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,743
-You probably haven't
had much of a chance

628
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:19,878
to be a kid yourself,
have you, Kerra?

629
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:26,818
-Just lucky, I guess, way things
work out, the way things are.

630
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,420
-But, you know,
with the way things

631
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,856
finally turnout-- we
all have a say in that.

632
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:33,559
We-- we do, God willing.

633
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,295
-I'm not very religious.

634
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:38,998
-Perhaps you just need
something worth believing in.

635
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:40,499
-My dad was a Mormon, right?

636
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,204
-Now, Kerra, you may have
been told a lot of things.

637
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:46,472
But your dad loved you.

638
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:47,706
He loved you so much.

639
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,075
-Aunt Corrine, I was
wondering if you, uh,

640
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:52,778
if you knew of any jobs,
for the summer I mean.

641
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,613
-Perhaps.

642
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,848
What about Florida?

643
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,217
-My mom's not quite settled in.

644
00:31:58,217 --> 00:31:59,551
I'm sure it would be fine.

645
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:06,258
-Look, Kerra, I will help you.

646
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:12,864
Any-- any way I can, I'll be
there for you, I-- I will.

647
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,401
-Thanks.

00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:21,640

650
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,674
-Upstairs.

651
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:23,942
-I thought you two were playing?

652
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,077
-We were.

653
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:27,980
He won all my cards.

654
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,381
-He what?

655
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:32,584
-All my Yu-Gi-Oh!, all my
Pokemon, he won em all.

657
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,756
[snickering]
-Give them back.

658
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,058
-Give what back?

659
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:40,459
-You know very well
what I'm talking about.

660
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,960
I can't believe you took
advantage of your cousin.

661
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,162
-Oh, I was going to
give em back any way.

-Is this all?

00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:48,800
-Yeah, practically.
-Don't lie to me.

00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,136
Is this all or not?

665
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:52,071
-I'll-- I'll even throw
in one or two of mine.

666
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:53,872
-Is this all or isn't it?

667
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,275
-Hey, I won his cards,
fair and square.

668
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:59,878
I deserve to keep at least one.

of yours to replace

it, whichever one he chooses.

Not a ghost.

716
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:53,879
Kerra, get a hold of yourself.

717
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,922
Just a jerk, trespasser.

[scrambled voice]

719
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:21,873
-What are you doing here?
It's dangerous.

720
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,075
-You don't belong here.
This is private property.

721
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,110
-It's no one's property.

722
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,077
Who are you!?

723
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:26,978
-Corrine and Drew's niece.

724
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,380
-Who!?

725
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,548
-The McConnells, they
live right through there.

726
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:30,582
And if they knew
you were here, you'd

727
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:31,517
get a rear end full of buckshot.

728
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:32,718
-Right through where?

729
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,252
-(PANICKED) Look,
I won't ask again.

730
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,688
I'll just go back and
have them call the cops.

731
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,256
Come any closer and
I'll take your head off.

732
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,425
I'm warning you!

733
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:40,759

so strangely?

734
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,394
-(SCOFFING) Have
you seen a mirror?

735
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:43,429
-What is your name?

736
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:44,796
What is your tribe?

737
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:51,102
-Look, look, I'm just
gonna go home now, OK?

738
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,440
I'll leave you here to
play your Aztec-- Apache--

739
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,308
-You're one of them, aren't you?

740
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:57,876
-One of them?
-A Gadianton!

741
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:59,811
Just like them to
send a woman spy.

742
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,913
-Look, I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.

743
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,382
-Then what is your tribe?

744
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:04,249
What is your name!?

745
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,083
-Sakura!

746
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:10,055
-Sakura?

747
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,964
It's me.

748
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:21,333
It's Kiddoni.

-Never mind, Dad.

756
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:52,163
She just showed up.
Kerra?

757
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,546
Kerra, are you all right?

758
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:09,448
-(SNIFFLING) Yes, Aunt Corrine.

759
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:11,950
I'll be out in a minute.

760
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:12,784
-All right.

761
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,286
Breakfast is ready, eggs.

NEWSCASTER (ON RADIO):

768
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,585
was in Silver Reef,
where one home

769
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:48,587
reported a new crack
in the driveway.

770
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:50,321
There are also reports of
broken glass shattered--

771
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,389
-I heard them when I woke up.

772
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,425
Why am I always the only one?

773
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:54,693
Did you hear them, Kerra?

774
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:55,827
Did you hear the whistlers?

775
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,328
-That's enough.

everybody's frightened enough

up that nonsense.

00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:02,200
-Where were you?

781
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,602
-I went for a walk.

782
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:05,036
-You weren't here when
Uncle Drew left for work.

783
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:05,937
I was worried.

784
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:07,005
-Sorry.

785
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,907
-Did you see any
cracks in the driveway?

786
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,408
-I didn't notice.

787
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,610
-But in the woods
there was this sort

788
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,712
of long crevice in the ground--

789
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:14,946

my little Soriah?

793

Oh.

794
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:25,256
Just wanted to make sure
everyone is all right.

795
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,257
-We're fine.

796
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,493
Have you had breakfast, Dad?

-Hey Grandpa, some geology
guys are coming today.

799
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:33,298
They think the epicenter
was right in the middle

of our hollow.

coming to survey the area.

00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:40,005
-They called 30 minutes ago.

804
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:41,206
-I have to go.

805
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:42,541
-W-- you haven't eaten.

-I'm sorry.
I'm-- I'm not hungry.

-You're back.

812
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:35,627
It is you, isn't it, Sakura?

813
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:39,364
You've grown up.

814
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,235
I visited here 1,000 times
after you stopped coming.

815
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:47,973
Why?

816
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:54,279
Why did you stop coming?

817
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:55,513
-I moved away.

818
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,416
I-- I couldn't come.

819
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:02,954
-I chose this as my post,
this place in the wilderness,

820
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:07,058
hoping that someday you might--
that I might see you again.

821
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:07,959
-You're real.

822
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,261
(LAUGHING) I can't believe it.

823
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:15,667
I had decided that you didn't--
I stopped believing in you.

824
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:18,503
-My father used to say
that you were a demon.

825
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:23,141
But I told him only an angel
could be so kind and beautiful.

826
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:24,542
-Don't call me that.

827
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,945
I'm not an angel.

828
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:32,618
And you-- I still can't
believe you're here.

829
00:42:32,618 --> 00:42:35,220
You meant everything
to me once, my friend,

830
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:41,860
my-- my secret friend in
the woods, my only friend.

831
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,328
I missed you so much.

832
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:51,569
When we were kids, I
never asked or even cared,

833
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,206
but now-- what are you, Kiddoni?

834
00:42:55,206 --> 00:43:00,646
-I'm a Nephite, a warrior in
the army of Captain Gidgiddoni.

835
00:43:00,646 --> 00:43:01,546
This is my outpost.

836
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:03,381
I watch for enemy spies.

837
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:04,415
-Enemy spies?

838
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,917
-Robbers of Gadianton.

839
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,688
They infest these mountains
and forests like vermin.

840
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:12,157
They are vermin.

841
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:13,759
My people have gathered
all their possessions

842
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:15,126
to Zarahemla in self-defence--

843
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:16,728
-To Zarahem--?

844
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:18,163
-Our capital.

845
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:21,633
You cannot mean you do not
know the great city of Z--

846
00:43:21,633 --> 00:43:23,534
if not an angel, what are you?

847
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,070
-A girl.

848
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,872
Just a girl.

849
00:43:26,872 --> 00:43:29,741
This is America, Utah.

850
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:31,777
Over there is a little
town called Leeds.

851
00:43:31,777 --> 00:43:33,511
-There are no cities
that way, just

852
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:35,280
jungles and
mountains to the sea.

853
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,381
-There's no jungles here.

854
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:38,817
-Here?
-Here, where I am.

855
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:39,951
I don't understand.

856
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,953
I mean, we occupy
the same place.

857
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,790
But right here, this
spot of ground, it's

858
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,124
not the same for you and me.

859
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,827
It's like we're in two
different-- it's like--

860
00:43:48,827 --> 00:43:52,230
-This is the wilderness of
Zarahemla, named for Zarahemla,

861
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:55,166
a descendant of Mulek, son of
Kind Zedekiah of Old Jerusalem,

862
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,835
who crossed the great
waters like Father Lehi,

863
00:43:56,835 --> 00:44:00,772
to escape the great--
-Wait, what did you say?

864
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:02,207
-Which part?

865
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:06,411
-Old Jerusalem, your people
came here from Israel?

866
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:08,780
-Yes.

867
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,581
-You're from the past.

868
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,183
-From what?

869
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:13,985
-From the past, from a time and
place that hasn't existed for--

870
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,821
I don't know,
thousands of years.

871
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:17,388
-This is nonsense.

872
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:18,456
Why am I from the past?

873
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:19,691
Maybe you're from the past.

874
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:21,459
-No, sorry.

875
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:22,861
Why are you so sure?

876
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:27,332
-The things you said,
Old Jerusalem, Zarahemla.

877
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,167
How long ago did your
people cross the ocean?

878
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,501
-600 years.

879
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,569
-Wow.

880
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:33,204
Then that would make it--

881
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:36,041
-The six month of the
19th year since the sign

882
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:38,977
was given of the
birth of the messiah.

883
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:40,645
-What?

884
00:44:40,645 --> 00:44:41,847
-You've never heard
of the messiah?

885
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:43,314
-No, I've heard of it.

886
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:44,449
It's just that I never
thought that it was actually--

887
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:45,784
-Kerra!
-It's all right!

888
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:48,553
It's my brother.

889
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:50,756
-He must keep his voice
down, or these entire woods

890
00:44:50,756 --> 00:44:52,157
will be swarming
with Gadiantons.

891
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:53,992
-I'll go to him.

892
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:55,393
Actually, I just
came here to warn

893
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:56,661
you there's people coming here.

894
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:57,595
-Gadiantons?

895
00:44:57,595 --> 00:44:59,364
-Heh, geologists.

896
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:00,331
People from my world.

897
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:01,833
They're-- Never mind.

898
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,935
Just stay away from here for
a little while, a day or two.

899
00:45:03,935 --> 00:45:05,570
-I can't desert my post.

900
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,538
I will be reprimanded
or flogged.

901
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,240
-Then hide, please.

902
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,176
If they found you here,
there's no telling--

903
00:45:11,176 --> 00:45:12,043
BROCK: Kerra!

904
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,979
-I have to go.
-Wait.

905
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:29,194
-You can't get through that way.

906
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:30,361
Go back.

907
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:31,863
-I'm stuck And who
were you talking to?

908
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:33,598
-No one.
Stay there.

909
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:35,733
I'm coming around.

910
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:36,902
-I know what I heard.

911
00:45:36,902 --> 00:45:38,269
-No, you don't.

912
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:39,704
-Did you really
see someone, Kerra?

913
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:41,572
One of Grandpa's ghosts?

914
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,707
-No, th-- there's nobody.

915
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:43,674
All right?

916
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:44,876
Everybody just chill out.

917
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:51,316
-Grandpa, what's a Nephite?

918
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:54,119
-A descendant of Nephi.

919
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,888
Their tribe once lived
in ancient America.

920
00:45:56,888 --> 00:45:59,825
Where did you hear that word?

921
00:45:59,825 --> 00:46:05,063
-I don't remember exactly,
on TV or something.

922
00:46:05,063 --> 00:46:07,933
-Well, Nephites were
a powerful nation.

923
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:10,768
They built cities
and ships, temples.

924
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,704
Their civilization
lasted 1,000 years.

925
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:15,740
-What happened to them?

926
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,242
-They were destroyed.

927
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:18,609
KERRA: By who?

928
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,912
-Lamanites,
descendants of Laman.

929
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:22,814
Nephi and Laman were brothers.

930
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:26,017
But they became bitter enemies.

931
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,953
The feud was carried
on by their children

932
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:30,588
and their children's children.
-But they lived.

933
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:32,057
-We're not sure.

934
00:46:32,057 --> 00:46:34,860
Somewhere in this
hemisphere, but most

935
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,494
think Central or South America.

936
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:37,695
-But not here.

937
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:40,131
-You mean Utah?

938
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,499
Maybe some of them did.

939
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:42,533
We don't know for sure.

940
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,702
-Were there ever jungles here?

941
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:46,804
-(LAUGHING) Maybe 65
million years ago.

942
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:56,181
-Why haven't I ever
heard of these tribes?

into chapters and verses.

945
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:07,025

you're welcome to read it.

946

[music playing]

947
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:07,818
-I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have frightened you.

948
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,820
-I can feel you.

949
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,990
I don't understand.

950
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,824
-It's like before.

951
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:17,963
Sometimes I could touch you,
and sometimes I-- I couldn't.

952
00:48:17,963 --> 00:48:19,597
-The rift must be widening.

953
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:20,932
It's getting stronger.

954
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:24,502
-So it appears, for now.

955
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:27,438
But if the earth rumbles
again, it may not remain.

956
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:30,942
What is that?

957
00:48:30,942 --> 00:48:33,778
-A book about you, I think.

958
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:35,646
-Me?
-Your people.

959
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:42,420
-I can't read this.

960
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,922
What language is this?
-The same one you're speaking.

961
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,457
-I speak the same
language of my fathers.

962
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:48,326
-You speak English.

963
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:52,197
Or at least that's what I hear.

964
00:48:52,197 --> 00:48:53,264
(LAUGHING) This is intense.

965
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:54,832
I have no i--
-Shh.

966
00:48:54,832 --> 00:49:01,339
Come with me.

967
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:03,474
Now, tell me, what
is that place?

968
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:05,276
-(WHISPERING) Get down.
They might see you.

969
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:06,877
-It wasn't there yesterday.

970
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,513
-It's my aunt and
uncle's farmhouse.

971
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:10,181
Like I said, the rift
must be widening.

972
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:12,150
-I've been debating
whether I should attack it.

973
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,485
-Please don't.

974
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:17,455
-But it's right in the
path of the invasion.

975
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,456
-Excuse me?

976
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,924
-Oh, never mind.

977
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:21,459
No one believes me, anyway.

978
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:25,330
-Wait, is that all you see?

979
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,532
Don't you see any other houses?

980
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:29,167
My uncle's orchards?

981
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:32,637
-I see the hills of Gideon,
the wilderness of Hermounts.

982
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:34,139
-And over there?

983
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:35,606
-Forests and jungles.

984
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:37,742
Beyond is the great
city of Zarahemla.

985
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:39,077
-Stop!

986
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:40,811
You're there.

987
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,580
You're at the edge of the rift.

988
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:48,386
Ah!

989
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:52,157
It must take in most
of the valley now.

990
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:53,324
Let's go back.

991
00:49:59,364 --> 00:50:03,368
-Before, when you were little,
you were always so sad.

992
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:05,836
Why?

993
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,738
-It was a sad time.

994
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:08,773
My parents divorced.

995
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:11,008
And then my father went away.

996
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,143
-Went away?

997
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:13,978
-It's not important.

998
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:15,880
-I understand.

999
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,484
My own parents were killed,
murdered by the same demons

1000
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:21,886
that seek to destroy my people.

1001
00:50:21,886 --> 00:50:24,755
But I will fight
them, I will do all

1002
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,858
I can to drive them from
the face of this earth.

1003
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,026
-Wow.

1004
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,929
That sounds heavy.

1005
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:33,664
-You don't approve?

1006
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:35,733
-I just don't think it
could be good for anyone

1007
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:36,701
to feel so much hate.

1008
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:37,902
-Hate?

1009
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:40,138
No, this is a
struggle for survival.

1010
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:41,706
-You know, no matter how
many of them you kill,

1011
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:44,109
it won't bring them back.
It won't change anything.

1012
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:46,177
-To do nothing is weakness.

1013
00:50:46,177 --> 00:50:47,612
I will change things.

1014
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:48,513
I will defend my people.

1015
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:50,281
-Look, that's not what I meant.

1016
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:52,550
I'm-- wow, I'm sorry.

1017
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:58,589
It's just-- nothing lasts,
especially things you love.

1018
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:00,858
You can count on it.

1019
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:03,027
-That sounds so lonely.

1020
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:04,229
Do you believe in nothing?

1021
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:06,197
-Not really.

1022
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:07,998
Not much.

1023
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,967
(LAUGHING) This is all so crazy.

1024

It's not real.

1025

00:52:55,105 --> 00:53:06,317
And great and terrible shall
that day be unto the wicked."

1064
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:08,919
HITCH (ON PHONE): Hello?
-Uh, I need to talk to Spree.

1065
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,288
HITCH (ON PHONE): He's not here.

1066
00:53:10,288 --> 00:53:12,857
He asked me to
take his messages.

1067
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:15,226
[ratchet cranking]

1068
00:53:15,226 --> 00:53:24,935
-It's Brock.

1069
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,704
He'll know who I am.

1070
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:31,976
Just tell him to come
get me, right away.

1071
00:53:31,976 --> 00:53:33,411
HITCH (ON PHONE): Where are you?

1072
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:34,745
-I'll give you directions.

1073
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:36,180
Ready?

1074
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,016
-"Behold I prophesy unto you
concerning the last days."

1075
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:41,018
[stick breaks]

1076
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:49,560
[low voice]

1077
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:56,734
-Hello?

1078
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:03,874
[door opens]

1079
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:05,242
CORRINE: Skyler?

1080
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,245
Do you have my good
dish towels out there?

1081
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,615
-The rooster ones?
CORRINE: Yes.

1082
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:15,219
-These are your good ones?

1083
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:17,355
CORRINE: I want
them in here now.

1084
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:20,090
In the wash, with bleach.

1085
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,059
(UNDER HER BREATH)
Dangit, Skyler.

1086
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:23,060
[sighs]

1087
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,029
[door closes]

1088
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:33,371
[corrine talking inside]

1089
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:35,740
CORRINE: --his car in the mud.

1090
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:38,242
-"And there are also
secret combinations,

1091
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:41,579
even as in times
of old, according

1092
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:44,549
to the combinations
of the devil.

1093
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:48,152
For he is the foundation
of all these things."

1094
00:54:48,152 --> 00:54:49,854
-(LAUGHING) What a day.

1095
00:54:49,854 --> 00:54:52,457
KERRA: "Yea, the foundation of
murder and works of darkness."

1096
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:54,024
CORRINE (INSIDE):
--and into next week

1097
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:57,562
until I've decided that maybe
you will remember not to do

1098
00:54:57,562 --> 00:54:59,129
this to every dish
towel that I own.

1099
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,966
KERRA: "And he leadeth them by
the neck with a flaxen cord."

1100
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:03,534
SKYLER (INSIDE): I left
the one in the car.

1101
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:05,870
CORRINE (INSIDE): You finish.

1102
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:08,806
And then let's watch the movie
like the rest of the family

1103
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:11,742
and take my shoes off
and enjoy myself--

1104
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:25,289
-"Until he bindeth them with
these strong cords forever."

1105
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:29,026
[screaming]
-Mom!

1106
00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:31,295
Mom!
Oh my god!

1107
00:55:31,295 --> 00:55:33,431
[screaming] Oh my god!

1108
00:55:33,431 --> 00:55:34,832
-Go see what is going on!

1109
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,367
Honey, tell me
what's the matter.

1110
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:38,135
What did you see?
[whimpering]

1111
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:40,170
Honey, what happened?

1112
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,873
-Don't see nothing there.
-They're gonna check it out.

1113
00:55:42,873 --> 00:55:43,741
Everything's OK.

1114
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:45,876
[whimpering]

1115
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:47,845
-She said his face was
painted red, like blood.

1116
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:50,615
And he wore a helmet in
the shape of a skull.

1117
00:55:50,615 --> 00:55:51,882
-A Gadianton spy.

1118
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:53,017
-Gadians?

1119
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:53,951
I thought your
enemies were Lamanites

1120
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:55,319
-Not in my lifetime.

1121
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:57,287
Although, many
Gadiantons are Lamanites.

1122
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:58,889
Nephites, too.

1123
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:03,661
They're a secret society,
sorcerer's and murderers.

1124
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:05,596
They swear bloody oaths,
hide their crimes,

1125
00:56:05,596 --> 00:56:07,998
and destroy anything
that threatens them.

1126
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:09,667
Your people may not
understand such things.

1127
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:12,803
-No, we understand,
unfortunately.

1128
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:14,204
-Their numbers
increased in our lands

1129
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,407
until they became too numerous.

1130
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:17,542
Those who would
not join them were

1131
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:19,677
forced to gather into one body.

1132
00:56:19,677 --> 00:56:21,145
Now, the armies
of the Gadiantons

1133
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:22,279
are prepared to attack.

1134
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:23,213
-The invasion?

1135
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,782
-Yes.

1136
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:26,316
Our generals say the attack
will come from the mountains,

1137
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:27,985
just as Lamanite
armies of long ago.

1138
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:31,288
But if you've seen a
spy, it's further proof

1139
00:56:31,288 --> 00:56:32,757
that I've been right all along.

1140
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:34,158
They have to believe me now.

1141
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:36,060
-And you're the only one
guarding this entire area?

1142
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,428
-Of course not.

1143
00:56:37,428 --> 00:56:40,197
There are others I can
signal them with this.

1144
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:44,234
But I'm the only one stationed
in this particular valley.

1145
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,770
No one thinks it's
important, too

1146
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:48,506
congested, and full of briers.

1147
00:56:48,506 --> 00:56:50,708
But that's exactly
it, it's an advantage.

1148
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,877
If I were old
Giddianhi, I'd send my--

1149
00:56:52,877 --> 00:56:53,544
-Who?

1150
00:56:53,544 --> 00:56:54,712
-Their leader.

1151
00:56:54,712 --> 00:56:56,280
If I were Giddianhi,
I'd send my army

1152
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,116
creeping right through here
under the cover of these trees.

1153
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:00,317
-When would this happen?

1154
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:02,052
-Some say next Spring.

1155
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:03,353
I say sooner.

1156
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,490
We burned our crops before
gathering to Zarahemla.

1157
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,625
The Gadiantons are too
lazy to do honest work,

1158
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,659
so they're starving.

1159
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:09,694
They could attack at any moment.

1160
00:57:09,694 --> 00:57:12,830
I must tell my captain.

1161
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,765
Sakura, you must
warn your family.

1162
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:20,137
If there's trouble,
blow this with all

1163
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:21,772
your wind and strength.

1164
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,273
The lookout on the
next ridge will

1165
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,775
hear it and sound
another warning.

1166
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:27,478
Then another will sound
until the entire Nephite

1167
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:29,980
army is alerted.
I won't be long.

1168
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:37,254
-Grandpa Lee.

1169
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:51,201
[mysterious music]

1170
00:58:57,434 --> 00:59:00,404
[animal sounds]

1171
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:04,341
-Cool.

1172
00:59:18,689 --> 00:59:20,891
[crow cawing]

1173
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:36,240
-Not a sound.

1174
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,107
Not one.

1175
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:47,251
-What is he?

1176
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:57,094
-What is he?

1177
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,763
-Unknown.
TRIBESMAN: A Nephite?

1178
00:59:58,763 --> 00:59:59,930
-Does he look like a Nephite?

1179
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,799
-One of the children
of the fortress,

1180
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:03,300
the one with the
lights and the music.

1181
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,501
-Hold your tongue.

1182
01:00:04,501 --> 01:00:06,336
-What are you?
-What am I?

1183
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:07,805
-Are you a spectre?

1184
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:09,039
A devil child?

1185
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:10,440
-Not the last time I looked.

1186
01:00:17,581 --> 01:00:19,016
-What are you
doing in the woods?

1187
01:00:19,016 --> 01:00:20,384
-Walking.

1188
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:22,319
Who is-- Who's that?

1189
01:00:31,696 --> 01:00:34,699
-He's not important, a
slave awaiting death.

1190
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:35,800
-What have you done to him?

1191
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,767
-Same as we'll do to you.

1192
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:38,168
-We're wasting time here.

1193
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:39,770
Giddianhi will be coming
through here in the next--

1194
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,305
-Silence, Makan!

1195
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,472
Are you a complete idiot?

1196
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,275
Speak in the tongue
of the Nehors!

1197
01:00:45,275 --> 01:00:47,745
-Forgive me, Lord Kush.

1198
01:00:47,745 --> 01:00:49,980
I will use the secret tongue.

1199
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,582
Our army will pass through
here in a few hours.

1200
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:53,918
The escaped slave
has been recaptured.

1201
01:00:53,918 --> 01:00:55,319
But the Nephite watchman lives.

1202
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:57,521
We have to kill anyone
who might sound a warning.

1203
01:00:57,521 --> 01:00:59,056
-But the Nephite
is not at his post!

1204
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:00,357
-This warrior has seen us!

1205
01:01:00,357 --> 01:01:01,325
Execute him!

1206
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:02,760
And the slave, right now!

1207
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,528
-I won't tell anybody
about the-- about the army.

1208
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:05,529
I swear.
I--

1209
01:01:05,529 --> 01:01:06,663
I--
-You understood us?

1210
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,198
-How did he understand?
-A demon!

1211
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:10,434
-Where did you learn the
tongue of the Nehors?

1212
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:12,069
-I-- I can't say, really, I--

1213
01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:13,738
-Slay him.
Cut his throat.

1214
01:01:13,738 --> 01:01:14,905
-Can't kill a phantom.

1215
01:01:14,905 --> 01:01:17,674
-Watch me.
-Don't be a fool.

1216
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,509
His body will be found here.

1217
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,711
The Nephites will investigate.

1218
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:22,479
The invasion will be revealed.

1219
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:23,814
-He knows the secret language!

1220
01:01:23,814 --> 01:01:25,315
He's like the bearded slave!

1221
01:01:25,315 --> 01:01:26,183
A sorcerer of tongues.

1222
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:27,451
-He's a child of the underworld.

1223
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:29,053
-Giddianhi will decide.

1224
01:01:32,957 --> 01:01:34,992
-It's his, isn't it?

1225
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:36,060
It belonged to my father.

1226
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:41,065
Grandpa says you were with
him the day he disappeared.

1227
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:44,134
-That's right.
[laughing] He shot a bull

1228
01:01:44,134 --> 01:01:45,736
elk without the proper license.

1229
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:49,940
[sighs] I knew his life was a
mess, I-- like everybody else,

1230
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,676
I just figured he'd had
enough of it all and took off.

1231
01:01:52,676 --> 01:01:53,878
-Didn't anybody search?

1232
01:01:53,878 --> 01:01:55,913
-We all searched, Kerra.

1233
01:01:55,913 --> 01:01:58,983
There was no sign
of him or the elk.

1234
01:01:58,983 --> 01:02:00,217
-But, Grandpa, you
