1
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:26,023
Honey, It's time to go. We'll go
home and we'll open our
presents.

2
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:27,892
No we have to wait.

3
01:00:27,925 --> 01:00:30,995
The son of Santa so daddy will
come home for Christmas.

4
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:33,964
Please don't promise her things
she can't have.

5
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:39,837
Honey I told you. Daddy's on a
business trip and he won't be
home.

6
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:42,106
Actually I think he will.

7
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:42,707
[Gasp]

8
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:43,841
Daddy!

9
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:45,943
But what about your business
trip?

10
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,311
I told them they could wait.

11
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:50,414
Christmas is for family.

12
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:52,883
Cut!

13
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:54,885
Ok everybody that's a cut!

14
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,388
You're doing it again.

15
01:00:58,823 --> 01:00:59,323
What?

16
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:00,390
Bond Villain.

17
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:03,260
How many times have I fired you
today?

18
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:05,796
Mmm I stopped counting when I
ran out of fingers.

19
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:09,099
Are we good?

20
01:01:09,133 --> 01:01:10,434
Yeah it was alright.

21
01:01:10,835 --> 01:01:12,302
It was alright. Thank you.

22
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:13,137
That's lunch.

23
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,773
Ok people we got it! That's
lunch!

24
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:17,775
Eric.

25
01:01:17,942 --> 01:01:19,309
How long have you been here?

26
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:22,046
I waved. You were kinda in the
zone.

27
01:01:22,246 --> 01:01:26,450
* Tis the season to be jolly.
Fa la la la la la la la la *

28
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:28,753
Penny who? What? Why?...

29
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:30,855
You said the crew could have a
gift exchange.

30
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:31,655
I gotta go.

31
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,023
No no no you gotta wait a
minute.

32
01:01:33,057 --> 01:01:36,360
A said anonymous. Fast.
Discrete.

33
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:37,227
Old man Barnes lives for this.

34
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:39,429
- He's a distraction.
- Look at that face!

35
01:01:41,265 --> 01:01:44,334
Mr. Barnes I'm sorry but we're
gonna have to cut this short.

36
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:46,303
What is that noise?

37
01:01:46,804 --> 01:01:48,372
Where's it coming from? Hello?

38
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:51,241
Am I the only one that could
hear that?

39
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:55,780
Look you asked me to come down
to see you. So I came down. I
see you...

40
01:01:55,813 --> 01:01:58,248
Meg. It's Frank again.

41
01:01:58,282 --> 01:01:59,249
Goodbye.

42
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:05,790
Hi. Umm Sal.

43
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:07,892
Hi! Meg.

44
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:09,393
How did you know my name?

45
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:12,396
That bohunk over there called
you Meg.

46
01:02:12,797 --> 01:02:13,831
You need to go.

47
01:02:14,498 --> 01:02:15,265
Ok.

48
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:19,003
I'm sorry?

49
01:02:19,036 --> 01:02:20,237
Can I help you?

50
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,338
My bell.

51
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:23,373
Oh yes. Right.

52
01:02:23,908 --> 01:02:25,009
Wait.

53
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:26,844
Merry Christmas.

54
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:28,979
You too Mr. Barnes.

55
01:02:29,013 --> 01:02:30,380
You too.

56
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,384
How did she know your name?

57
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,387
[Clears throat]

58
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:39,256
- Hey.
- I'm gonna go.

59
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:40,791
Wait! No I thought you were
gonna stay for dinner?

60
01:02:40,825 --> 01:02:44,228
Your craft service guys have not
even heard for paleo and you're
not exactly-

61
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:45,963
We'll find you something to eat
I'm -

62
01:02:45,996 --> 01:02:47,664
Yes. Yes.
How is this?
[Gasp]

63
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:55,339
Yes! That is truly repulsive. It
looks like grandmas old yarn.
Where did you find it?

64
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:57,041
You've seen me knit.

65
01:02:57,074 --> 01:02:59,910
Well done! Yes! Taking one for
the team.

66
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:02,546
Hey everyone! This right here is
what I'm talking about.

67
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:05,449
Christmas is not for the elves.

68
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:07,317
Hurra!

69
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:09,253
Yeah. Ok.

70
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,320
Eric.

71
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:12,823
Honey.

72
01:03:12,857 --> 01:03:13,958
Hold on.

73
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:18,128
Pooch got the hi-roller suite.

74
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:19,796
It's gonna be epic.

75
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:24,101
Sweetheart it's gonna be
Christmas. You sure you want to
go to Vegas for a bro-liday?

76
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:27,337
Says the head elf. Huh? Hurra!

77
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:28,705
Well?

78
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:32,442
Come on, I'll be home by Monday
just in time for therapy.

79
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:33,410
Ok.

80
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:34,478
Meg?

81
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:35,512
Ummm Not now.

82
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:37,281
Now! Meg.

83
01:03:38,082 --> 01:03:40,284
Hi Frank! Hello.

84
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,852
You're not answering your phone.

85
01:03:41,886 --> 01:03:43,253
Ok. Frank listen to me.

86
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:47,024
The scene with the snow angels I
can make it better. I promise I
can.

87
01:03:47,057 --> 01:03:49,593
You tell me every year you watch
these films with your family.

88
01:03:49,626 --> 01:03:52,562
You say they are the only
thing you make that you actually
do watch with them.

89
01:03:52,596 --> 01:03:54,231
You are making me older by the
minute.

90
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:57,201
No. That's just life doing that.

91
01:03:57,234 --> 01:03:58,435
It's a figure of speech Meg.

92
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:01,238
Let me do this my way.

93
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:02,806
Ok please?

94
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,576
I might be a dysfunctional
shipwreck of a human being but
I know Christmas.

95
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:12,416
I can-No I will deliver the
perfect Christmas movie.

96
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:13,450
[Sigh]

97
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:14,518
Keep shooting.

98
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:15,519
Yes.

99
01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:16,320
No!

100
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,255
I'm sorry?

101
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:21,191
No. Meg this is not ok.

102
01:04:21,225 --> 01:04:22,326
Oh here we go.

103
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,328
Meg these people have families!

104
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:25,762
I have a family.

105
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:29,266
Well no one is making you stay
Bob Cratchit. Would you like to
leave?

106
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:35,005
That's what I thought. It is now
2:57, we are gonna come back in
15 minutes and keep shooting.

107
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:04,168
You shouldn't wear your hair
like that.

108
01:05:05,069 --> 01:05:06,170
Makes you look old.

109
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:08,505
I though I told you to leave.

110
01:05:08,538 --> 01:05:10,174
I like it here.

111
01:05:10,207 --> 01:05:11,575
Plus it reminds me of that.

112
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:14,378
That's what you're going for
right?

113
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,446
You want people to feel like
they are really right up in
there?

114
01:05:17,014 --> 01:05:18,615
Nose pressed up against the
glass.

115
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:23,520
Life's like a snow globe. You
gotta shake it up to see the
snow.

116
01:05:24,288 --> 01:05:25,189
Yoo hoo!

117
01:05:29,293 --> 01:05:31,195
How did you get there?

118
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:32,396
Let me see it.

119
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:34,999
Come on. Give it a shake.

120
01:05:37,701 --> 01:05:40,670
Look at that! It's so shiny.

121
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:42,072
It's glitter.

122
01:05:42,106 --> 01:05:45,542
Hmm. That's not what you see.

123
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:49,613
Snow is falling down slowly.

124
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:55,285
Tiny perfect little town with
tiny perfect little people.

125
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:57,621
It's everything you'll never
have.

126
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,126
I don't need this.

127
01:06:02,226 --> 01:06:03,727
Are you sure about that?

128
01:06:11,035 --> 01:06:12,602
You gotta want it.

129
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:17,541
Really want it.

130
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:24,614
Ok.

131
01:06:27,284 --> 01:06:28,285
[Grunt]

132
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:35,659
Meg! Meg!

133
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:40,530
[Distorted Voice]
Meg? Meg?

134
01:06:41,765 --> 01:06:44,334
Meg? Meg!

135
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:46,770
Meg!

136
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:49,806
Sweetie?

137
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:50,474
Honey?

138
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:54,678
Ah she's awake. Thank goodness.

139
01:06:54,711 --> 01:06:55,479
What?

140
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,514
We were all so worried about
you.

141
01:06:57,547 --> 01:06:58,782
Where am I?

142
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:04,020
Now.

143
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:07,023
You young lady took quite a
spill.

144
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:12,829
You need your rest. I want you
to run along home now and have
yourself a nice cup of hot coco.

145
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:16,300
And if you do that you will be
right as rain in no time.

146
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:18,268
What is this?

147
01:07:18,468 --> 01:07:20,770
Teddy must have dinged you
pretty bad.

148
01:07:20,804 --> 01:07:22,406
Wait? Ted?

149
01:07:22,439 --> 01:07:24,108
From college?

150
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:24,808
We use to date.

151
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:32,216
Yeah babe and then we got
married. I'm your husband.

152
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:37,121
I - no stop it. Stop doing that.

153
01:07:37,687 --> 01:07:41,458
Uh what is this? Are we filming
here?

154
01:07:41,491 --> 01:07:43,560
Where's the crew?

155
01:07:45,129 --> 01:07:49,233
Ok. Uh this is obviously an
exterior scene.

156
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:52,236
How did we get here?

157
01:07:52,469 --> 01:07:54,138
Last thing I remember...

158
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:56,072
Oh?

159
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,408
I think I tried to cancel
Christmas.

160
01:07:59,876 --> 01:08:03,247
Honey you may be a control freak
but not even you can cancel
Christmas.

161
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,217
Please stop calling me honey.
I'm not your honey.

162
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:10,187
I'm sorry did you say married?

163
01:08:14,258 --> 01:08:15,525
[Laughs]
What?

164
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:17,627
To a lumberjack?

165
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:23,767
You're starting to scare the
kids.

166
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,402
Kids?

167
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:32,609
Mom. Sorry. Dad told me not to
pack it too tight.

168
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:33,743
Mom?

169
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:34,678
Yeah.

170
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:36,846
Ok. This is hilarious.

171
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,382
Crew prank right?

172
01:08:39,216 --> 01:08:43,320
Trying to punish me by giving me
"It's a wonderful life".

173
01:08:43,353 --> 01:08:49,193
Complete with that corny modern
really really photogenic family.

174
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:54,164
You guys are good! Let me see
you. Wow! You even look like a
real brother and sister.

175
01:08:54,198 --> 01:08:55,665
Who's your agent?

176
01:08:58,468 --> 01:08:59,068
Ok?

177
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:01,571
This is obviously all fake.

178
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:10,780
Um, this is actual snow. We
don't have the money for actual
snow.

179
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:13,483
Christmas is not for the elves!

180
01:09:17,221 --> 01:09:18,154
Hoora?

181
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:22,259
It's an episode.

182
01:09:22,292 --> 01:09:23,960
Penny! Where is Penny?

183
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,529
Is mom gonna be ok?

184
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:28,365
Yeah Teddy. She's gonna be fine.

185
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:30,200
Mia why don't you take your
brother home?

186
01:09:30,234 --> 01:09:31,401
I'll be there in a second.

187
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:33,603
Meg!

188
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,206
Thanks Doc!

189
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,510
Officer!

190
01:09:40,544 --> 01:09:43,380
Office thank goodness you're
here. I need to report a
potential kidnapping.

191
01:09:43,413 --> 01:09:46,250
This gentlemen right here is
trying to take me against my
will and I'm pretty sure-

192
01:09:46,283 --> 01:09:47,717
What?

193
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:48,685
He drugged me because I have no
idea where I am or who I am
right now.

194
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:49,819
Baby no!

195
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:51,455
Yeah! He keeps calling baby and
he thinks I'm his wife.

196
01:09:51,488 --> 01:09:52,422
- And we are not married.
- You are my wife!

197
01:09:52,456 --> 01:09:53,257
I am not your wife.

198
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:54,824
Problem Sir?

199
01:09:56,893 --> 01:09:59,229
Oh you?

200
01:09:59,263 --> 01:10:00,664
I should have known.

201
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,633
Officer there is absolutely no
problem ok?

202
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:06,670
We were having a snowball
fight. My son dinged her in the
head.

203
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:09,005
She has a mid case of amnesia.
That's what the doctor said.

204
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:09,873
I got hit in the head.

205
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:12,376
Exactly! Yes! You got hit in the
head.

206
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:16,613
You're at home in your tiny
perfect town.

207
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,551
I'm in my movie.

208
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:22,952
Oh no.

209
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:27,691
I'm in my F-.
Standard and practices don't
swear. Freaken' movie!

210
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,393
You know what?

211
01:10:29,426 --> 01:10:30,527
Meg.

212
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,362
You're absolutely right.

213
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:34,631
You are in a movie.

214
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:38,502
And this right here. This is a
set!

215
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:40,003
Guess what?

216
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:41,405
The camera is in the truck.

217
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:44,708
So baby why don't we head
towards the truck where the
camera is.

218
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:46,576
This is amazing.

219
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:47,844
Roll sound!

220
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:49,846
Wow! I even got the clock tower
right.

221
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:50,514
Uh huh.

222
01:10:50,547 --> 01:10:51,815
This is like my snow globe.

223
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:52,816
Yeah.

224
01:10:52,849 --> 01:10:55,452
Just brought on by stress and
energy drinks.

225
01:10:55,485 --> 01:10:57,387
This just feels so real.

226
01:10:57,421 --> 01:10:59,589
Yeah. Get in the truck.

227
01:10:59,623 --> 01:11:01,691
[Laughs]
Ok. Yeah.

228
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,395
Oh god she lost her mind.

229
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:23,880
I'm going to fix you a drink.

230
01:11:23,913 --> 01:11:25,482
Ok.

231
01:11:26,082 --> 01:11:27,784
Whoa.

232
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:38,595
What? Eggnog? Are you keeping
me? That stuff has a squintilian
calories per sip.

233
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,497
Just the way you like it.

234
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:44,468
Full cream. Extra nutmeg.

235
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:45,835
To you.

236
01:11:46,836 --> 01:11:52,876
Oh. I just have to keep asking
myself. WWMOD.

237
01:11:52,909 --> 01:11:54,344
What's that?

238
01:11:54,378 --> 01:11:55,712
What Would Marie Osmond Do.

239
01:11:55,745 --> 01:11:57,046
Oh. Gotcha.

240
01:11:57,714 --> 01:11:58,682
To us!

241
01:12:02,386 --> 01:12:04,120
Mmmm.

242
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,089
Dream food has no calories!

243
01:12:06,122 --> 01:12:08,124
[Laughs]

244
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:08,825
Show me more.

245
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:10,026
Absolutely. Follow me this way.

246
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:13,930
A little bit of paradise. My mom
use to call it "Landover".

247
01:12:13,963 --> 01:12:17,467
Whoa! It's beautiful.

248
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:20,036
- [Laughs]
- Mom. Dad. You're home.

249
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:23,106
Oh! It's our beautiful kids.

250
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:25,742
Hey! Come over here.

[Laughing]
Oh my goodness.

252
01:12:28,645 --> 01:12:29,913
Let me look at you.

253
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:31,681
Wow!

254
01:12:31,715 --> 01:12:33,883
You're perfect.

255
01:12:34,551 --> 01:12:36,553
[Laughing]

256
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:39,723
This is the best concussion
ever.
[Laughing]

257
01:12:39,756 --> 01:12:40,624
Snow ball fight!

258
01:12:40,657 --> 01:12:41,157
Yay!

259
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,892
No! No no no no!

260
01:12:42,926 --> 01:12:44,027
No no!

261
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:47,731
Baby 20 minutes ago you didn't
remember their names.

262
01:12:47,764 --> 01:12:49,098
Well...

263
01:12:49,132 --> 01:12:52,068
So maybe we should start easy.

264
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:54,404
Snowman.

265
01:12:54,438 --> 01:12:54,871
Yeah!

266
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:56,440
Snowman!

267
01:12:56,473 --> 01:12:57,574
- Ok.
- Alright.

268
01:12:57,607 --> 01:12:58,842
Snowman.

269
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:13,923
Wow this a really nice dream.

270
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,827
I don't want to wake up.

271
01:13:18,161 --> 01:13:19,663
So afraid this will end.

272
01:13:20,697 --> 01:13:24,768
You say that every night honey
and, it never does.

273
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:30,073
Get under these... arms right
there.

274
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:31,741
[Laughing]

275
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:36,946
Hey I remember what I use to
call you.

276
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:38,014
What?

277
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,784
Show tune Ted.

278
01:13:40,817 --> 01:13:42,619
Cause you loved musical theater.

279
01:13:42,652 --> 01:13:44,554
I still love musical theater.

280
01:13:45,489 --> 01:13:46,856
I still love you.

281
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,697
So this is what it would have
been like.

282
01:13:54,063 --> 01:13:56,566
If I would have joined you on
the train that day.

283
01:13:58,234 --> 01:13:59,235
Remember?

284
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:00,804
Uh-hm.

285
01:14:01,571 --> 01:14:04,073
You invited me to join you for
Christmas.

286
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:08,745
I was suppose to take the 3
o'clock train.

287
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:13,783
But instead I backed out at the
last minute.

288
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:18,888
I had work so, I just didn't
show.

289
01:14:18,988 --> 01:14:22,859
But then you turned around and
you came with me here.

290
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:28,164
Wow.

291
01:14:29,032 --> 01:14:30,800
Can you imagine?

292
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:32,569
I don't have to.

293
01:14:33,637 --> 01:14:34,137
Why?

294
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,972
Because you're here.

295
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:41,477
You chose to be here. You chose
to be with me.

296
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:44,914
You're gonna remember that.

297
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:46,616
[Chuckle]

298
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:48,151
What if I don't?

299
01:14:48,952 --> 01:14:53,690
They I will use every tool in my
formatable arcinal to make sure

300
01:14:53,723 --> 01:14:56,626
That you fall in love with
me all over again.

301
01:14:59,763 --> 01:15:01,865
It sure is a lovely dream.

302
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:06,135
[Inhale/Exhale]

303
01:15:07,737 --> 01:15:11,107

sometime, right?

305
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:30,126

Ugh!

Reality.

309
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:45,041
Where's my phone? I gotta call
Penny.

310
01:15:45,141 --> 01:15:45,942

Yes I do. But I also do not want
you to tell my Ted. I mean, my

If you follow this path. Cut

01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:30,313
Sounds good.

Well this. This is what
everybody wants.

The dream of wonderland.

527
01:27:45,894 --> 01:27:51,033
You have any idea how hard I
work every year to capture this
exact feeling?

528
01:27:51,066 --> 01:27:53,302
At the pageant?

529
01:27:53,336 --> 01:27:55,571

The forest is the heart of the
town.

535
01:28:09,718 --> 01:28:14,357
As long as there's a pulse in my
chest that will never happen.

These miniatures are exquisite.
They're all hand painted.

01:28:59,735 --> 01:29:03,105
Just like your grandpa use to
make right?

That's right.

545
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:08,577
Don't look at me like that.

546
01:29:08,611 --> 01:29:09,612
Like what?

547
01:29:09,645 --> 01:29:11,346
Like I don't know you. Alright.

548
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:16,018
You may not know me but believe
you missy, I've been to the
circus and seen the show.

549
01:29:16,051 --> 01:29:17,052
The whole show?

550
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:18,654
All three rings.

551
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:22,391
Alright. What street does my mom
live on?

552
01:29:22,425 --> 01:29:23,792
I'm not playing this game.

553
01:29:23,826 --> 01:29:24,493
What game?

554
01:29:24,527 --> 01:29:26,395
I'm not playing quiz kid Ted.

555
01:29:26,429 --> 01:29:28,731
Why now? If you did you could
prove to me that you're real.

556
01:29:28,764 --> 01:29:33,068
Except if I'm a figment of your
imagination, wouldn't I know
everything you know?

557
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:36,138
So me telling you wouldn't prove
anything.

558
01:29:36,171 --> 01:29:37,506
It's a fallacy.

559
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:39,442
An Argument from innocence.

560
01:29:39,475 --> 01:29:40,676
What does that mean?

561
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:43,145
- Oh you don't know what that
means?
- No.

562
01:29:43,178 --> 01:29:46,849
That's because in college I took
debate and you didn't.

563
01:29:46,882 --> 01:29:49,618
Which means I know something you
don't.

564
01:29:49,652 --> 01:29:54,757
Which is impossible. Unless...
I'm real.

565
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:59,094
[Gasp]
Woooo!
[Laughing]

566
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:00,963
See that right there? That's my
real dance.

567
01:30:00,996 --> 01:30:02,330
That's nice.

568
01:30:02,364 --> 01:30:05,468
Let me do. Let me do let me
finish it off. Let me finish it
off.

569
01:30:05,501 --> 01:30:06,802
Work it out. Alright I'm good.

570
01:30:06,835 --> 01:30:08,704
Ok point Ted.

571
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:09,505
Alright.

572
01:30:09,538 --> 01:30:10,105
Yes.

573
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:11,607
Looser buys lunch.

574
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,641
I don't have any money.

575
01:30:12,675 --> 01:30:14,443
Check your back pocket.

576
01:30:14,477 --> 01:30:16,779
- Go on.
- What?

577
01:30:16,812 --> 01:30:20,516
Oh what the? What the? That's
because we share a wallet.

578
01:30:20,549 --> 01:30:24,219
Yeah. My wife hates purses.

579
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:27,456
[Makes Explosion Sound]

580
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:28,924
That was your brain. Brain
blowing.

581
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:29,892
I got it.

582
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:31,460
I blew your mind you get it?

583
01:30:31,494 --> 01:30:35,931
- I get it. Yeah mind blown.
-[Explosion Sound] Ok. Just
saying. You got amnesia.

584
01:30:35,964 --> 01:30:39,001
And here's your extra large rice
pudding.

585
01:30:39,034 --> 01:30:39,902
Yay!

586
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:40,903
And your pancakes.

587
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:42,838
Oh.

588
01:30:42,871 --> 01:30:44,473
This is all so amazing.

589
01:30:44,507 --> 01:30:47,610
I'll be back with your griddled
cheese and your BLT.

590
01:30:47,643 --> 01:30:50,513
- Mmm extra B.
- Extra B. I remember.

591
01:30:50,546 --> 01:30:52,581
Thank you.

592
01:30:52,848 --> 01:30:54,850
You do realize I'm humoring you
right now?

593
01:30:54,883 --> 01:30:59,087
Hey buddy you opened Pandora's
box with that eggnog.

594
01:30:59,622 --> 01:31:02,558
What's the deal with that clock
over there?

595
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:06,862
Every time I look at it it says
2:59.

596
01:31:06,895 --> 01:31:08,230
It's right twice a day.

597
01:31:08,263 --> 01:31:12,668
The weird thing is that that's
the exact time I had my
accident.

598
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:16,204
I'm just waiting for you to try
the rice pudding.

599
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:20,208
Mmm. It's really really good.

600
01:31:20,242 --> 01:31:25,748
You know that very rice pudding
was your favorite food when you
were pregnant with Teddy Jr.

601
01:31:26,281 --> 01:31:28,717
You couldn't get enough of it.
You use to send me at all

602
01:31:28,751 --> 01:31:31,954
Hours of the night
to get that for you.

603
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:34,156
You remember?

604
01:31:34,189 --> 01:31:36,258
Sorry I don't remember.

605
01:31:36,291 --> 01:31:38,694
Nope I do not.

606
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:42,665
[Inhale/Sigh]

607
01:31:42,698 --> 01:31:44,266
So...

608
01:31:46,101 --> 01:31:51,740
I just want to be super clear
ok? I don't remember anything
about our married life together.

609
01:31:51,774 --> 01:31:55,578
And I will never remember
anything about our married life
together because

610
01:31:55,611 --> 01:32:00,015
We don't have, in fact we never
had a married life together.

611
01:32:00,048 --> 01:32:06,555
So all these adorable little
reminds and...

612
01:32:06,589 --> 01:32:10,926
Perfect may I add reminds. It's
just not working.

613
01:32:10,959 --> 01:32:14,930
OK. I too want to be perfectly
clear.

614
01:32:14,963 --> 01:32:17,866
Umm...
[Clears Throat]

615
01:32:19,602 --> 01:32:22,270
You are my wife.

616
01:32:22,304 --> 01:32:24,740
And you're the mother of our
children.

617
01:32:24,773 --> 01:32:28,276
And every time you say you're
not it's like a dagger through
my heart.

618
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:30,846
So whatever it is you got going
on you gotta figure it out

619
01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:33,348
Because I'm almost
out of perfect.

620
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:38,186
And I'm serious. If you have to
pretend but...

621
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:42,791
Don't do more damage then what
you already have.

622
01:32:45,327 --> 01:32:47,162
Oh shoot.

623
01:32:47,195 --> 01:32:49,064
That man is looking for his car.

624
01:32:49,097 --> 01:32:53,769
Which is all the way out in
bumplefudge.

625
01:32:55,337 --> 01:32:57,906
That's my Eric!

626
01:32:58,641 --> 01:33:00,042
Your Eric.

627
01:33:00,943 --> 01:33:02,745
Eric!

628
01:33:02,778 --> 01:33:03,612
Aah!

629
01:33:03,646 --> 01:33:05,347
Megan!

630
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:07,382
You didn't go to Vegas.

631
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:09,652
No?

632
01:33:09,685 --> 01:33:12,187
Eric if you are in on all of
this I have taken it in, and

633
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:18,661
I've found my ability to forgive
but mostly I am so happy to see
you.

634
01:33:18,694 --> 01:33:21,797
Well I would be happy to see my
car. I think someone stole it.

635
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:24,667
Oh that was your car? No no I
took it.

636
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:26,268
You stole my car?

637
01:33:26,301 --> 01:33:28,637
Well I borrowed it.

638
01:33:28,671 --> 01:33:32,875
But Eric listen to me I, I
respect your intentions but

639
01:33:32,908 --> 01:33:36,912
I am filled with gratitude that
we are both stuck here together

640
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:38,847
In this crazy town.

641
01:33:38,881 --> 01:33:43,919
[Laughs]
Well I'm stuck here cause you
stole my car.

642
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:46,188
It must have been a heck of a
concussion.

643
01:33:46,221 --> 01:33:50,025
Eric please tell me you remember
our life together?

644
01:33:51,226 --> 01:33:51,660
Honey?

645
01:33:51,694 --> 01:33:52,627
- Ted.
- Hey.

646
01:33:52,661 --> 01:33:55,197
I expect you to make this car
thing right.

647
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:57,065
Absolutely. All the free
firewood you want.

648
01:33:57,099 --> 01:33:58,834
You two know each other?

649
01:33:58,867 --> 01:34:02,237
You know I rather have your
house. My offer still stands.

650
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:04,773
Like I said, It's not for sale
Mayor.

651
01:34:04,807 --> 01:34:05,874
Mayor?

652
01:34:05,908 --> 01:34:07,710
Eric the Mayor?

653
01:34:07,743 --> 01:34:10,913
Yes and unfortunately I have a
city counsel meeting to get to.

654
01:34:10,946 --> 01:34:12,881
I guess I have to walk.

655
01:34:12,915 --> 01:34:14,950
Sorry about that.

656
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:17,953
See you two at the festival
committee meeting huh.

657
01:34:19,221 --> 01:34:21,123
Really sorry about that.

658
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:23,692
We'll get your car back to you.

659
01:34:25,928 --> 01:34:27,295
He didn't even wave.

660
01:34:27,329 --> 01:34:28,330
Huh? What?

661
01:34:28,363 --> 01:34:31,066
He didn't wave goodbye.

662
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:33,101
Ok I'll be right there!

663
01:34:33,135 --> 01:34:36,038
Honey I gotta pay the tab that
we ran out on. Please don't-

664
01:34:36,071 --> 01:34:39,474
Oh no! You've gone crazy again.
Don't go crazy.

665
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:42,110
Don't cry first of all. Don't
cry.

666
01:34:42,144 --> 01:34:44,346
Second don't steal anything.

667
01:34:44,379 --> 01:34:47,215
Third, try not to act crazy.

668
01:34:48,216 --> 01:34:52,120
Well, I guess I might as well
just give up.

669
01:34:57,492 --> 01:34:59,127
[Sigh]

670
01:34:59,161 --> 01:35:00,562
Unless.

671
01:35:00,595 --> 01:35:04,733
Wait she said everything I need
is right here. That's what she
meant.

672
01:35:04,767 --> 01:35:05,968
Hmm?

673
01:35:06,001 --> 01:35:09,404
Ted, what did Eric just say
about doing a festival meeting?

674
01:35:09,437 --> 01:35:11,840
Yeah, we do the pageant every
year.

675
01:35:11,874 --> 01:35:18,046
Oh! That is the perfect
opportunity to work on our
relationship.

676
01:35:19,014 --> 01:35:21,884
Absolutely baby. It will be just
like College.

677
01:35:21,917 --> 01:35:23,819
Red and Ginger all over again.

678
01:35:23,852 --> 01:35:28,023
Yeah that's - that's right.
Show tune Ted.

679
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:30,392
More like
[Smooth Voice]
Show tune Ted.

680
01:35:30,425 --> 01:35:32,060
* He's got shows tunes he's
go... *

681
01:35:32,094 --> 01:35:32,861
I get the point.

682
01:35:32,895 --> 01:35:34,830
- Alright.
- Thank You.

683
01:35:43,205 --> 01:35:44,172
Meg.

684
01:35:44,206 --> 01:35:46,408
Honey we are gonna run the show
from the top ok?

685
01:35:46,441 --> 01:35:50,545
Ok I'll be right there, I'm just
gonna grab an eggnog.

686
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:52,815
Nog it up like I do.

687
01:35:52,848 --> 01:35:54,416
Ok.

688
01:35:55,117 --> 01:35:57,519
Hello. Mayor Eric.

689
01:35:57,552 --> 01:35:59,454
Megan.

690
01:36:01,156 --> 01:36:02,791
There we go. Alright so gonna
draw straws and that's how we'll
hand out parts alright?

691
01:36:02,825 --> 01:36:04,359
So everybody grab a straw.

692
01:36:06,194 --> 01:36:11,834
I just stopped by to tell you
that we just don't have wiggle
room for the costumes this year.

693
01:36:11,867 --> 01:36:13,235
But you can sow right?

694
01:36:13,268 --> 01:36:15,370
Uh yeah you bet.

695
01:36:15,403 --> 01:36:17,472
Christmas is not for the elves.

696
01:36:17,505 --> 01:36:19,541
[Laughs]

697
01:36:19,574 --> 01:36:21,276
What does that even mean?

698
01:36:21,309 --> 01:36:28,083
Oh, You know just that it's the
elves job to make Christmas
special for everyone else.

699
01:36:28,116 --> 01:36:30,518
[Sigh] There's just not enough
money in the budget.

700
01:36:30,552 --> 01:36:33,288
There is never enough money.

701
01:36:34,056 --> 01:36:35,723
Um Eric?

702
01:36:35,757 --> 01:36:41,463
Um you know I've been thinking
about some ideas of how the town
could make some money.

703
01:36:41,496 --> 01:36:43,265
- Oh yeah?
- Uh huh.

704
01:36:43,298 --> 01:36:44,933
Go on.

705
01:36:44,967 --> 01:36:48,503
I mean if this were the city
you could put up all these
contradicting conflicting

706
01:36:48,536 --> 01:36:52,975
Street signs and then give out a
whole bunch of parking tickets.

707
01:36:53,008 --> 01:36:55,110
You know what, that is actually
a good Idea.

708
01:36:55,143 --> 01:37:01,116
Yeah? Well I'm full of good
ideas for how the town can raise
funds.

709
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:02,317
Oh yeah? Like what?

710
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:03,385
How about the woods?

711
01:37:03,418 --> 01:37:06,889
I mean they're beautiful but
they're just so big.

712
01:37:06,922 --> 01:37:10,325
You can certainly develop part
of them.

713
01:37:10,558 --> 01:37:13,028
Like a country club.

714
01:37:13,061 --> 01:37:14,362
Yeah exactly!

715
01:37:14,396 --> 01:37:19,301
Maybe some ski lifts.
Parking lots. Power. Water.

716
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:22,938
You'd have to bulldoze about
half. Maybe 3/4 of it.

717
01:37:22,971 --> 01:37:27,009
Well that might be a little
ambitious.

718
01:37:27,042 --> 01:37:33,015
You know, I have to admit. I am
seeing you through completely
new eyes right now.

719
01:37:33,048 --> 01:37:35,383
Oh yeah?

720
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:42,124
We should talk over lunch about
your ideas.

721
01:37:43,025 --> 01:37:44,459
Action.

722
01:37:45,493 --> 01:37:48,230
[Knocking]

723
01:37:48,663 --> 01:37:51,433
There is no room in this inn.

724
01:37:52,434 --> 01:37:54,569
[Laughs]
Very good.

725
01:37:55,303 --> 01:37:56,204
What?

726
01:37:56,238 --> 01:37:57,739
Huh? Nothing.

727
01:38:00,408 --> 01:38:03,278
If you have something to say you
should go up there and say it.
Go for yours.

728
01:38:03,311 --> 01:38:03,878
Really?

729
01:38:03,912 --> 01:38:05,981
- Go for yours.
- Alright.

730
01:38:06,614 --> 01:38:09,584
[Clap] Talent! Listen up.

731
01:38:09,617 --> 01:38:13,555
Let me ask you guys a question.
Do you believe in this story?

732
01:38:13,588 --> 01:38:16,959
I'm not asking if you if you
believe that this story
happened.

733
01:38:16,992 --> 01:38:20,462
I'm asking do you believe in the
way in which it happened?

734
01:38:20,495 --> 01:38:25,333
Mary, You've ever gotten
really sick in class?

735
01:38:25,367 --> 01:38:26,801
It's embarrassing, right?

736
01:38:26,834 --> 01:38:29,204
And you have to talk to the
teacher. You gotta get some help
from him.

737
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:34,242
But all you're concentrated on
is not hurling all over his hush
puppies, right?

738
01:38:34,276 --> 01:38:36,478
Ok, keep that.

739
01:38:36,511 --> 01:38:40,415
Joseph, Your parents drink?

740
01:38:40,448 --> 01:38:44,519
Not even a little bit? On the
holidays? New Years Eve?

741
01:38:44,552 --> 01:38:49,457
Yeah! Ok good. I want you to
imagine your dad drunk.

742
01:38:49,624 --> 01:38:51,426
Like drunk as a skunk.

743
01:38:51,459 --> 01:38:53,161
Oh my god!

744
01:38:53,195 --> 01:38:58,000
And it's not your fault. You
didn't do anything to cause this
and you love him so much.

745
01:38:58,033 --> 01:39:01,003
All you have to do is get him
home, safely in bed.

746
01:39:01,036 --> 01:39:05,440
But you don't want people to
judge him because that would
just kill you.

747
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:08,176
Right? You got it?

748
01:39:08,210 --> 01:39:09,744
Innkeeper?

749
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:11,579
Yo.

750
01:39:11,613 --> 01:39:16,518
Imagine everyone's been given
candy for a special treat, and
they want some of yours too...

751
01:39:16,551 --> 01:39:18,553
[Interrupts]
Honey!

752
01:39:18,753 --> 01:39:22,457
Alright, let's take it from the
top.

753
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:23,758
Ready?

754
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:24,859
Places.

755
01:39:24,892 --> 01:39:27,529
What does this have to do with
the nativity story?

756
01:39:27,562 --> 01:39:30,132
And...

757
01:39:30,165 --> 01:39:31,966
Action!

758
01:39:33,435 --> 01:39:35,770
[Knocking]

759
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:39,107
There's no more room at this
inn.

760
01:39:39,641 --> 01:39:41,443
[Clapping]

761
01:39:41,476 --> 01:39:44,112
That was OK.

762
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:48,550
Meg: That was better then OK.

763
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:49,817
I have an idea.

764
01:39:49,851 --> 01:39:53,188
Starting tomorrow we're gonna
change things up a little bit.

765
01:39:53,221 --> 01:39:58,326
No more picking actors by drawn
straws. We are gonna do actual
auditions.

766
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:00,662
I would like all of you to come
in tomorrow morning having

767
01:40:00,695 --> 01:40:04,432
Prepared 2 paged dramatic
monologues.

768
01:40:04,466 --> 01:40:06,234
Um, what is a monologue?

769
01:40:06,268 --> 01:40:08,536
Google it.

770
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:11,239
No Google?

771
01:40:11,273 --> 01:40:11,806
No.

772
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:13,608
Library?

773
01:40:13,641 --> 01:40:16,144
Alright library it.

774
01:40:16,178 --> 01:40:18,780
And come dressed to move.

775
01:40:21,416 --> 01:40:23,451
That means dance.

776
01:40:24,586 --> 01:40:26,088
- Not bad.
- Thank you.

777
01:40:26,121 --> 01:40:28,523
- Not bad at all.
- Thank you.

778
01:40:28,556 --> 01:40:30,525
I like that you are changing
things up a little bit.

779
01:40:30,558 --> 01:40:31,759
- Thank you.
- You know what I really like?

780
01:40:31,793 --> 01:40:32,327
What's that?

781
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,628
The dance. Give me some.

782
01:40:33,661 --> 01:40:35,530
Oh oh! Hello!

783
01:40:35,563 --> 01:40:37,199
Oh!
[Laughing]

784
01:40:37,232 --> 01:40:38,800
Somebody's got her mojo back.

785
01:40:38,833 --> 01:40:39,834
I yes.

786
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:41,469
- Yeah!
- I do.

787
01:40:41,503 --> 01:40:43,605
Back in college we use to shake
it on the dance floor.

788
01:40:43,638 --> 01:40:44,606
Don't there's kids around.

789
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:45,607
Shake it from behind.

790
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:47,542
Ok kids here.

791
01:40:47,575 --> 01:40:48,443
That's right.

792
01:40:48,476 --> 01:40:50,512
Let's get some work done.

793
01:40:50,545 --> 01:40:52,480
They know how they go here don't
they?

794
01:40:52,514 --> 01:40:54,482
I don't know.

795
01:40:54,782 --> 01:40:56,551
So when are we gonna get a tree?

796
01:40:56,584 --> 01:40:58,553
Not today. We have a show to
rewrite.

797
01:40:58,586 --> 01:41:00,088
But it's almost Christmas.

798
01:41:00,122 --> 01:41:00,622
Well.

799
01:41:00,655 --> 01:41:02,624
Meg. Ted.

800
01:41:02,657 --> 01:41:04,392
Hey.

801
01:41:04,426 --> 01:41:05,427
Mr. Blevin.

802
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:07,729
Have you seen our new trees?
Just got them in.

803
01:41:07,762 --> 01:41:10,298
You know our tradition. We cut
one. We plant one.

804
01:41:10,332 --> 01:41:11,833
That's right.

805
01:41:11,866 --> 01:41:13,601
Do you have trees like this?

806
01:41:13,635 --> 01:41:15,203
Oh I love this.
[Laughs]

807
01:41:15,237 --> 01:41:17,705
That is kitchy.

808
01:41:18,873 --> 01:41:20,342
Consider my gift to you.

809
01:41:20,375 --> 01:41:21,576
Oh wow.

810
01:41:21,609 --> 01:41:24,712
Are you serious? Thank you so
much.

811
01:41:24,746 --> 01:41:26,448
Just remember my son Lyn.

812
01:41:26,481 --> 01:41:28,850
He's auditioning tomorrow. He's
very talented.

813
01:41:28,883 --> 01:41:30,785
I will be sure to keep out my
eye out for him.

814
01:41:30,818 --> 01:41:34,656
And I will let you know as soon
as AD space goes on sale
for our program.

815
01:41:34,689 --> 01:41:40,195
I'm picturing a colorful, full
page spread for your shop.

816
01:41:40,495 --> 01:41:43,465
- Baby we don't have programs.
- We will.

817
01:41:43,498 --> 01:41:47,669
Leave it to me and we're gonna
have programs, flyers, tweets,
blogs, social network.

818
01:41:47,702 --> 01:41:49,137
Tweet and blogs?

819
01:41:49,171 --> 01:41:50,838
Or just flyers.

820
01:41:50,872 --> 01:41:54,376
See Teddy it's perfect. We got a
tree out of the deal too.

821
01:41:54,409 --> 01:41:55,543
Win Win.

822
01:41:55,577 --> 01:41:58,146
But it's not the same.

823
01:41:59,514 --> 01:42:01,283
Meg.

824
01:42:01,749 --> 01:42:03,851
This is pretty.

825
01:42:03,885 --> 01:42:05,287
If you like purple.

826
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,821
And I do.

827
01:42:15,397 --> 01:42:16,898
- Hey.
- You got a second?

828
01:42:16,931 --> 01:42:18,766
- Sure.
- I want to show you something.

829
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,902
- Ok.
- Yeah.

830
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:26,140
[Gasp]

831
01:42:28,243 --> 01:42:30,678
This is beautiful. You did this?

832
01:42:30,712 --> 01:42:33,147
Yeah. Just like our honeymoon.

833
01:42:34,516 --> 01:42:36,718
[Laughs]

834
01:42:36,751 --> 01:42:43,658
[Humming]

835
01:42:43,691 --> 01:42:45,560
What's that?

836
01:42:45,593 --> 01:42:47,862
It's our song.

837
01:42:47,895 --> 01:42:54,936
[Humming Song]

838
01:42:54,969 --> 01:42:58,673
- I can't.
- Meg.

839
01:42:58,706 --> 01:43:00,708
I can't I'm sorry.

840
01:43:00,742 --> 01:43:02,377
Come on.

841
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:06,648
I'm not, I'm not your wife.

842
01:43:06,881 --> 01:43:09,817
And I'm not your Meg.

843
01:43:10,652 --> 01:43:13,955
I know you think I am.

844
01:43:13,988 --> 01:43:18,393
Touching me would be cheating on
her.

845
01:43:18,426 --> 01:43:21,429
If you're not my wife where is
my wife?

846
01:43:21,463 --> 01:43:23,665
I don't know.

847
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:26,868
But I do know I'm not her.

848
01:43:27,001 --> 01:43:28,736
Ok?

849
01:43:30,004 --> 01:43:32,340
I'm sorry. I'll go sleep on the
couch.

850
01:43:32,374 --> 01:43:34,208
No.

851
01:43:35,843 --> 01:43:38,313
I know you're in there.

852
01:43:39,947 --> 01:43:43,818
Ok guys. Let's get started.

853
01:43:44,386 --> 01:43:49,591
Hello everyone and welcome to
the auditions for a Christmas
pageant a musical.

854
01:43:49,624 --> 01:43:56,498
[Clapping]

855
01:43:56,531 --> 01:43:59,734
I'm just gonna grab a bucket of
nog.

856
01:44:01,303 --> 01:44:03,004
Don't hurt yourself.

857
01:44:06,508 --> 01:44:07,709
Hey.

858
01:44:07,742 --> 01:44:10,778
I need to talk to you about
something really quick alright?

859
01:44:10,812 --> 01:44:13,781
I think it would make your mom
really happy if you auditioned
for the show.

860
01:44:13,815 --> 01:44:15,717
[Groan]

861
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:19,421
Oh. Well here it is. All
set. It's actually just a rough
draft.

862
01:44:19,454 --> 01:44:24,659
I was thinking maybe you and I
could get together and... hammer
it out.

863
01:44:24,692 --> 01:44:26,461
Maybe we can discuss it at the
party.

864
01:44:26,494 --> 01:44:29,831
You and Ted are going to be
there, right?

865
01:44:29,864 --> 01:44:35,437
Yeah... The party! That's right.
I... yes of course we wouldn't
miss it.

866
01:44:35,470 --> 01:44:38,806
Also, I cannot stop thinking...

867
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:41,476
About that land development idea
of yours.

868
01:44:41,509 --> 01:44:42,977
Oh.

869
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:44,679
I'm intrigued.

01:44:54,822 --> 01:44:56,724
[Sigh]

872
01:44:57,825 --> 01:44:59,126
What did Eric want?

873
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:04,065
Oh just wanted to remind us
about the Christmas party
tonight.

874
01:45:04,098 --> 01:45:06,033
So is Teddy gonna audition or
what?

875
01:45:06,067 --> 01:45:10,638
I know I tried to convince him
but uh, nope.

876
01:45:10,672 --> 01:45:11,339
Hmm.

877
01:45:11,373 --> 01:45:14,642
Ok Rose show us what you got.

878
01:45:14,676 --> 01:45:20,448
[Singing Off Key]
* Silent night. Holy...

879
01:45:20,482 --> 01:45:23,618

[Singing Off Key}
* Sleep in heavenly peace

883
01:45:39,401 --> 01:45:41,869
Look at them they are just
spinning on their toes.

884
01:45:41,903 --> 01:45:43,971
They are spinning on something.

885
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:56,784
* Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King, Peace
on earth... *

886
01:45:56,818 --> 01:45:58,520
Mom?

887
01:45:58,553 --> 01:45:59,387
Yeah?

888
01:45:59,421 --> 01:46:01,823
Do I have to sing?

889
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,558
Do you want a part?

890
01:46:03,591 --> 01:46:05,893
But...

891
01:46:05,927 --> 01:46:13,968
*...Join the triumph of the
skies; With th' angelic host
proclaim Christ is born...*

892
01:46:14,001 --> 01:46:16,938
I can't just give you a part.

893
01:46:16,971 --> 01:46:18,873
It doesn't work like that.

894
01:46:18,906 --> 01:46:21,776
You're just gonna have to try
mama Mia.

895
01:46:21,809 --> 01:46:24,579

Way way to hustle.

905
01:47:09,991 --> 01:47:11,125

- We're gonna look at cast list
first.
- Well we should let Mr. Barnes
go.

908
01:47:17,499 --> 01:47:20,201
And how many years have you
played Santa now?

909
01:47:20,234 --> 01:47:21,969
Everyone auditions.

910
01:47:22,003 --> 01:47:23,538
No gimmies. Thank you.

911
01:47:23,571 --> 01:47:25,139
Everyone auditions so...

912
01:47:25,172 --> 01:47:27,074
Can't wait to see.

913
01:47:27,108 --> 01:47:33,781

Stirring. Not e-

916
01:47:44,559 --> 01:47:45,760
Sorry. My throat-
[Clears Throat]
gets a little scratchy.

917
01:47:45,793 --> 01:47:49,731
You know, actually, Mr. Barnes I
think we have heard enough.

918
01:47:49,764 --> 01:47:52,199
Thank you very much for coming
in.

919
01:47:52,233 --> 01:47:54,969

921
01:48:01,976 --> 01:48:06,981

* Singing Toyland

927

What did you say to him?

928
01:48:25,867 --> 01:48:29,637
It's just a little trick I
learned in College.

929
01:48:29,671 --> 01:48:32,073
[Chuckles]
What's that?

930
01:48:32,173 --> 01:48:35,777
If you ever want to land a woman
like your mother some day best
way to her heart is

931
01:48:35,810 --> 01:48:39,213
A snappy tune and some fancy
foot work.

932
01:48:39,246 --> 01:48:41,716

936
01:49:06,774 --> 01:49:08,309
Ok everyone!

937
01:49:08,342 --> 01:49:10,845
Now you know what parts you're
playing. Now get up on stage and

01:49:10,878 --> 01:49:13,915
Try blocking before Ted and I
have to go home.

939
01:49:13,948 --> 01:49:16,250

940
01:49:17,919 --> 01:49:20,254
Come on. Places please.

941
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:28,029
The ones they picked weren't
that good?

942
01:49:28,062 --> 01:49:30,164
I mean, some people just don't
know talent when it bites them
in the-

943
01:49:30,197 --> 01:49:34,702
Tell me about it. Picking your
own kid to play Joseph.

944
01:49:34,869 --> 01:49:36,738
Merry Christmas gentlemen.

945
01:49:38,372 --> 01:49:41,208
See dad they have a real tree.

Yeah I know buddy. We'll get one
soon.

947
01:49:44,979 --> 01:49:46,748
Ok.

948
01:49:46,881 --> 01:49:48,816
- Hi.
- Hey.

949
01:49:48,850 --> 01:49:52,119
So then I said, I'm not pitchy.
You're pitchy.

950
01:49:52,153 --> 01:49:54,388
You looked really pretty up
there as Mary.

951
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:56,758
Thanks Jakie.

952
01:49:57,358 --> 01:49:59,326
You were amazing.

953
01:49:59,894 --> 01:50:04,832
Thanks. Now would you be a lamb
and get me some more punch?

954
01:50:09,003 --> 01:50:10,237
So then what happened?

955
01:50:10,271 --> 01:50:11,839
So then...

956
01:50:18,312 --> 01:50:19,947
Meg.

957
01:50:20,314 --> 01:50:21,716
Merry Christmas.

958
01:50:21,749 --> 01:50:23,751
Merry Christmas.

959
01:50:23,885 --> 01:50:26,620
I am really really glad you're
here.

960
01:50:26,821 --> 01:50:28,222
I was thinking about what you
said.

961
01:50:28,255 --> 01:50:30,357
You know about find a way?

962
01:50:30,391 --> 01:50:33,661
There's something about you
that-

963
01:50:33,695 --> 01:50:34,896
Hey honey.

964
01:50:34,929 --> 01:50:38,232
- Yeah?
- Have you seen Mimi? Teddy Jr.
said she ran off crying.

965
01:50:38,265 --> 01:50:41,368
Mia locked herself in the den
and won't come out.

966
01:50:42,403 --> 01:50:44,038
Baby open up.

967
01:50:44,071 --> 01:50:46,273
Go away. Leave me alone.

968
01:50:46,307 --> 01:50:49,043
Mia open the door.
[Knocking]

969
01:50:51,145 --> 01:50:53,647
She doesn't want to.

970
01:51:08,495 --> 01:51:09,964
Ok.

971
01:51:09,997 --> 01:51:12,099
What's wrong sweetie?

972
01:51:12,133 --> 01:51:14,201
I wanna die.

973
01:51:14,235 --> 01:51:17,338
People are treating me like I'm
a total dork.

974
01:51:17,371 --> 01:51:20,007
Oh no.

975
01:51:20,407 --> 01:51:24,345
That's not true.
You're not a dork.

976
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:29,116
Did you want to go out there and
audition like that?

977
01:51:29,150 --> 01:51:33,420
- [Shouts] No!
- See! You did it anyway, right?

978
01:51:33,454 --> 01:51:36,323
You got out there. You looked
it in the eye.

979
01:51:36,357 --> 01:51:38,192
You gave it all you had.

980
01:51:38,225 --> 01:51:46,768
This time it didn't go your way.
Next time... who knows, right?

981
01:51:46,801 --> 01:51:48,903
Come here.

982
01:51:49,436 --> 01:51:50,938
Come here.
[Claps]

983
01:51:50,972 --> 01:51:52,940
Ok.

984
01:51:53,274 --> 01:51:54,809
Alright.

985
01:51:58,545 --> 01:52:00,081
Hey guess what?

986
01:52:00,114 --> 01:52:03,184
When I was your age, same exact
thing happened to me.

987
01:52:03,217 --> 01:52:09,757
I auditioned for a play and they
told me, and I quote "You have
the worst singing voice"

988
01:52:09,791 --> 01:52:12,293
I've ever heard in my whole
life".

[Laughs]

990
01:52:13,828 --> 01:52:14,862
Where they wrong?

991
01:52:14,896 --> 01:52:18,099
No they were not wrong. I sound
like a dying cow.

992
01:52:18,132 --> 01:52:20,935
I was like * Woooo woooo

[Meg Mooing]

994
01:52:25,506 --> 01:52:28,409
I'm not even exaggerating...

995
01:52:28,442 --> 01:52:31,979
So what did you do?

996
01:52:32,013 --> 01:52:34,816
Well...

997
01:52:34,849 --> 01:52:37,051
I became the storyteller.

998
01:52:37,084 --> 01:52:39,320
I started making all the
decisions.

999
01:52:39,353 --> 01:52:43,357
So, did being in charge make you
feel better?

1000
01:52:44,959 --> 01:52:47,795
Yeah, I think it kinda did.

1001
01:52:50,331 --> 01:52:52,900
Do you want to find out?

1002
01:52:55,502 --> 01:52:59,340
Allow me to introduce you to our
new assistant producer.

1003
01:52:59,373 --> 01:53:00,942

Thanks!

1005
01:53:02,343 --> 01:53:04,311
I'm not gonna even let my kid
audition next year.

1006
01:53:04,345 --> 01:53:05,246
It's demoralizing.

1007
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:07,348
Why are you always trying to
upstage me?

1008
01:53:07,381 --> 01:53:10,151
Would you stop flirting with
victoria.

1009
01:53:10,184 --> 01:53:12,086
You think you're better then
everyone else.

1010
01:53:12,119 --> 01:53:14,588
I can't help it if you can't
sing.

1011
01:53:14,621 --> 01:53:15,589
- Bribery.
- I'm sick of you.

Oh yeah? And just where are we?

Just a little bit.

1044

You did that for me?

1045
01:55:56,083 --> 01:56:00,021
Just to make me feel more
comfortable?

1046
01:56:00,054 --> 01:56:04,125
Dad! Teddy's trying to climb the
Christmas tree.

1047
01:56:04,358 --> 01:56:06,460
I should probably get that.

1048
01:56:06,493 --> 01:56:07,328
I guess.

1049
01:56:07,361 --> 01:56:10,231
I'll bring us back some special
eggnog.

1050
01:56:10,264 --> 01:56:13,500
Oh um, about the eggnog I'm not
sure.

01:56:13,534 --> 01:56:18,105
I tried to button my mom jeans
this morning and they were a
little...

I mean you are smart and
worldly.

1069

Like that thing you suggested
about developing the land. I
mean...

1070
01:57:27,141 --> 01:57:32,779
Eric, that was a bad idea. A
mistake. Promise me you won't do
anything...

1071
01:57:32,813 --> 01:57:37,184
Look Meg. You and I belong
together.

1072
01:57:37,218 --> 01:57:41,355
Ok? Just not all the time.

1073
01:57:41,388 --> 01:57:43,257
Wait what?

1074

No Eric...

1075

No Ted.

Ah crappers, my wife.

1078
01:57:56,470 --> 01:57:59,106
Yeah.
Oh. Ted.

1079

01:58:07,514 --> 01:58:09,450
Hold on. Let me explain ok?

1083
01:58:09,483 --> 01:58:12,486
I thought he was the one I was
supposed to fix things with.

1084
01:58:12,519 --> 01:58:14,821
I thought he was the one I was
supposed to go back to.

1085
01:58:14,855 --> 01:58:17,224
Meg, I want you to ask yourself
a question.

1086
01:58:17,258 --> 01:58:19,526
I want you to be completely
honest, ok?

1087
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:21,462
What do you think is more
likely?

1088
01:58:21,495 --> 01:58:24,865
That you're a mom. Married to a
boring husband...

1089
01:58:24,898 --> 01:58:26,433
No you're not boring. You are
the furthest-

1090
01:58:26,467 --> 01:58:33,407
Living in a town where the only
excitement that happens is for a
few days during

1091
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:38,679
Christmas were you direct a
pageant that is actually more
fun the worst it is?

1092
01:58:38,712 --> 01:58:45,386
Or some self fulfilled fantasy
where you actually produce
Christmas movies instead

1093
01:58:45,419 --> 01:58:49,656
Of watching them in front of a
fire, drinking eggnog.

1094
01:58:51,925 --> 01:58:54,361
I get it. I get what you were
trying to tell me.

1095
01:58:54,395 --> 01:58:58,432
And I didn't want to hear it
but...

1096
01:58:58,565 --> 01:59:00,534
You know what you were right.

1097
01:59:01,235 --> 01:59:04,605
You were right Meg. You are not
the woman I married.

1098
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:08,609

out, you found it.

Yeah. That's the thing about a
snow globe.

1106
01:59:35,402 --> 01:59:38,505
The snow doesn't just fall, it
also swirls.

1107
01:59:38,539 --> 01:59:41,542

it's gonna land.

Would you please stop that for a
second. I can't even hear myself
think.

1116
02:00:05,499 --> 02:00:08,302
You asked for this. Literally.

Oh! I promised the gingerbread

I can't act this way.

me.

know. Relatable to just have a

yourselves.

do to change your mind?

I'm sorry.

02:06:34,154 --> 02:06:37,357
It might have been a moment of
weakness.

But there's simply no going

Eric this was you, wasn't it?

02:06:50,303 --> 02:06:52,238
I put the investors together.

1242
02:06:52,272 --> 02:06:56,109
But this is your town. How could
you do this?

1243
02:06:56,142 --> 02:06:59,079
Well it was your idea. It was a
great one at that.

Ted he misunderstood the...

1250
02:07:07,988 --> 02:07:11,892
Tell me destroying our home and
everything we love wasn't your
idea. Tell me this right now.

I just want you to know I didn't
decide any of this.

I'm just waiting up for the

do it one way you get angel

care if I walk with you?

need.

Eric has agreed to give us back
the land if we could match his

the forest.
