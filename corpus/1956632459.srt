DR. STEVE: <i>SLAP stands for</i>

354
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:37,076
<i>Superior Labrum
Anterior and Posterior.</i>

355
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:39,745
This top area here
is where the biceps tendon

356
00:18:39,812 --> 00:18:41,514
attaches to the labrum.

357
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,183
That's why
you are also feeling pain

358
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,384
running up your arm.

359
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,018
Now, in your case,

360
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:48,521
if you don't remember
a specific event,

361
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:50,424
then you could have
aggravated your shoulder

362
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:51,691
and then over time,

363
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,294
with repetition,
made it worse and worse.

364
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:55,928
Since it's the labrum,

365
00:18:55,995 --> 00:18:57,797
it's not just
overhead activities.

366
00:18:57,863 --> 00:19:00,400
Any strenuous activity
on the biceps tendon

367
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:02,101
will enhance it, as well.

369

What does that mean?

370
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:11,911
Well, you've done
extreme damage.

371
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:14,314
You have a level five
out of five SLAP tear.

372
00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:18,251
I've never actually seen
this level tear in person.

373
00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:19,518
Well, I mean,
it's not that bad.

374
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:21,288
I could easily
push through it.

375
00:19:21,355 --> 00:19:23,823
I'm afraid you need surgery
or you're running the risk of

376
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:26,926
permanent, irreversible,
damage.

377
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:28,594
But I'm...
But I'm in season right now, so...

378
00:19:28,661 --> 00:19:32,432
I understand. But Tyler,
this is very serious.

379
00:19:32,498 --> 00:19:33,799
I highly recommend you stop

380
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:35,534
all physical activity
immediately

381
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:36,969
and we get you surgery
as soon as possible.

382
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:39,972
Wait, what if...
What if we did it, um...

383
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,408
What if we did it
at the end of season

384
00:19:41,475 --> 00:19:42,541
and I could, you know,

385
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:43,943
I could recover
over the summer?

386
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,678
And I could be ready
for next year for college?

387
00:19:45,745 --> 00:19:47,780
I can't see you
making another match,

388
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:50,417
let alone
an entire season.

389
00:19:50,484 --> 00:19:53,152
Then, to be honest,
recovery would take much longer

390
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,820
than just the summer.

391
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:57,690
You're likely never to fully
recover to the way you were,

392
00:19:57,757 --> 00:20:00,026
