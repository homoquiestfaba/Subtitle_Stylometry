1
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,558
<i>Settle down, everybody.</i>

2
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,119
<i>Quiet, please.</i>

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,033
<i>Mobile phones off.
Thank you very much.</i>

4
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,559
OK.

5
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,028
<i>So, what is it that makes us what we are?</i>

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,077
<i>What is it that defines us?</i>

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,157
<i>Is it where we live?</i>

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,197
<i>Is it our schooling?</i>

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,077
<i>Or is it our family?</i>

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,956
<i>Alex Rider. Family?</i>

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,597
<i>Alex?</i>

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,870
- Yes, sir?
- Have you prepared something for us?

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,674
- Yes.
- Come on, then.

14
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,511
There's not much I can say about my family.

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,273
I didn't know my parents.
They died when I was small.

16
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,318
I live with my uncle.

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,318
<i>He's never around,
so I can't tell you much about him either.</i>

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,960
I have a housekeeper
because he's always away on business.

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,996
<i>She's an American. Her name is Jack.</i>

20
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,039
<i>She's always there for me,
which is great, because... he isn't.</i>

21
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,234
My uncle...

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,912
He's never gonna set the world on fire
because he's got a real boring job.

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,508
<i>Intruder alert! Intruder alert!</i>

24
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,477
His work means a lot to him, but...

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,311
...he never talks about it.

26
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,878
<i>Where's your uncle now?</i>

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,916
<i>He mentioned a conference in Cornwall.</i>

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,433
Life in the slow lane.

29
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,069
Whoops-a-daisy!
That's the way to do it.

30
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,193
Oh, what a pity!

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,718
<i>I wish I knew more about my uncle,
but he's not easy to pin down.</i>

32
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,391
And that's about it.

33
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,152
The end.

34
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,959
<i>Thank you, Alex.</i>

35
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,358
Hey, Sabina.

36
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,589
Alex.

37
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,717
I was wondering - do you wanna
do something this weekend?

38
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,157
I can't. I have riding lessons,
and... I'm going out with my parents.

39
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,117
It doesn't matter.

40
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,349
Maybe...

41
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,829
- Next weekend?
- Whatever.

42
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,509
<i>- Hey, Alex?
- Hey. Are you coming home?</i>

43
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,397
Yeah, I'm on my way now.

44
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,471
<i>How was the conference?</i>

45
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,913
Uh... It was fine.

46
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,398
<i>- You know how they are.
- No, I don't. You never tell me.</i>

47
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,838
There isn't much to tell. Wait a minute.

48
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,035
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

49
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,633
<i>Hello?</i>

50
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,999
<i>- What was that?
- Nothing.</i>

51
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,752
I'm really sorry about last week.

52
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,718
I know I said I'd be there,
but this trip just came out of nowhere.

53
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,279
As always.

54
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,793
Yeah.

55
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,559
I'll be back in time for dinner,
whatever Jack's cooked.

56
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,074
<i>- Then we've got the whole weekend.
- Really?</i>

57
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,799
- When did I ever let you down?
- Really want me to answer that?

58
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,599
Yeah, I know. Look, I'll see you soon, OK?

59
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,999
I'm glad you called.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,558
Yeah, me too.

61
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,352
I'll see you later, Alex.

62
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,953
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

63
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,632
On The Road

64
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,229
# And then I see you again

65
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,512
# And that look is in your eyes

66
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,036
# You blew my mind but it wasn't real

67
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,271
Blame

68
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,237
# You and I

69
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,155
# We're floating in a kaleidoscope of lies

70
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,670
# And tell me why

71
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,918
# You dress the truth in a velvet disguise

72
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,955
# I wanna break free

73
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,991
# You can never shake what I believe

74
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,719
# And the sunrise

75
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,190
# Paints the skies red with shame

76
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,350
# And you wake up
to find the whole world's gone insane

77
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,908
# But if you hide yourself away

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,877
# Well, I say

79
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,997
# Hey, you've only got yourself to blame

80
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,958
# Blame, blame, blame...

81
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,236
# Got to decide

82
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,430
# Whether or not you believe all those lies

83
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,594
# But take it from me

84
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,477
# They got a stranglehold

85
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,994
# On the air we breathe

86
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,998
# And the sunrise burns the sky red with shame

87
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,556
# And we wake up
to find the whole world's gone insane

88
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,756
# But if you hide yourself away

89
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,719
# Well, I say

90
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,192
# You've only got yourself to blame

91
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,793
Jack?

92
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,039
<i>Jack?</i>

93
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,957
Jack?

94
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,152
<i>Jack, are you here?</i>

95
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,149
Hah!

96
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,309
Jack.

97
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,919
Arigato.

98
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,513
Let's begin.

99
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,389
I met the most amazing guy
at the fishmonger's today.

100
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,357
Know what the problem with this country is?

101
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,193
Every good-looking guy
is either gay or married.

102
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,396
Except for you, but you're too young.

103
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,112
Will you please eat something?

104
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,159
- He's coming. He's just stuck in traffic.
- He'd have rung.

105
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,315
He's probably gone to the office
to put in a report,

106
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,550
and next thing we know
he's on his way to Hong Kong.

107
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,198
Let me down again.

108
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,397
- Well, his work means a lot to him.
- Yeah, it means a lot.

109
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,317
All the more for us.

110
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,311
What did I tell you?

111
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,992
Who's a genius?

112
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,835
Come on.

113
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,630
<i>We are gathered here today</i>

114
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,315
<i>to bid farewell to a man
called before his time.</i>

115
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,589
<i>A reminder that even in the midst of life
we are all of us walking together...</i>

116
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,477
...in the shadow of death.

117
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,596
Lan Rider was a good man.

118
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,639
Everyone who worked with him
will remember him for his courage,

119
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,075
and his loyalty.

120
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,152
He was, above all, a true patriot.

121
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,275
A patriot?

122
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,796
We have entrusted our brother to God's mercy.

123
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,155
We now commit his body to the grave.

124
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,038
<i>...Ian Rider, a true patriot.</i>

125
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,553
<i>...patriot, patriot...</i>

126
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,510
<i>...patriot...</i>

127
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,914
<i>To him be glory forever.</i>

128
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,877
Amen.

129
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,229
I'm John Crawford
from the Royal and General Bank.

130
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,993
I just want you to know
you have our condolences.

131
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,153
It's a tragedy, a car crash.
If only he'd been wearing a seat belt.

132
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,435
Thank you.

133
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,796
This is Alan Blunt.
He's the Chairman of the bank.

134
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,995
<i>Alex...</i>

135
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,150
Sorry about your uncle.

136
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,949
Um... we're going to miss him.
He talked a lot about you.

137
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,155
<i>That's strange.</i>

138
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,037
Cos he never mentioned you.

139
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,237
This is my deputy.

140
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,992
Mrs Jones.

141
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,389
I'll be in contact very soon, Alex.

142
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,356
Why?

143
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,670
Well... after what's happened,

144
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,274
there's the question
of who's going to look after you.

145
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,715
- I'll look after him.
- We're just trying to help.

146
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,588
I'm sure we'll meet again, Alex,
hopefully somewhere a little less...

147
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,750
...gloomy.

148
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,996
My uncle always wore a seat belt, Mr Blunt.

149
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,437
He was a very careful man.

150
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,876
Not careful enough.

151
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,550
Did you mean what you said
about looking after me?

152
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,074
Of course I did, idiot.

153
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,232
You know I'd never leave you.
Besides, who else is there?

154
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,391
I mean, will you be allowed to?
We're not even related.

155
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,357
I've been living with you for nine years.

156
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,556
How much more related do you wanna be?

157
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,517
Is it just me, or are those bankers weird?

158
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,748
Jack!

159
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,356
Hey! That's Ian's stuff!

160
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,078
Harry!

161
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,479
What the heck are you doing?

162
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,390
Alex?

163
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,719
Alex?

164
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,198
Alex!

165
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,712
Get out of it!

166
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,315
I Predict A Riot

167
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,708
If you see that Nigel,
you tell him I want him, right?

168
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,435
<i>Oi!</i>

169
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,749
<i>What's going on?</i>

170
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,556
The Rider car should've been done
two days ago, so do it now, all right?

171
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,871
- I didn't get the paperwork.
- Just do it, Harry.

172
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,837
I'm going to Liverpool Street.

173
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,194
<i>Liverpool Street?</i>

174
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,157
What, the station?

175
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,549
Yes, you berk. Where else?

176
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,551
I'm going to take them the stuff.

177
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,591
Bryce! Bryce!

178
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,594
<i>Tyson, get out!</i>

179
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,715
Oi!

180
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,510
Harry!

181
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,235
Oi!

182
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,829
Come here!

183
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,915
Urgh!

184
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,678
Rargh!

185
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,349
Rargh!

186
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,477
- How did he get in?
- Get out of the way!

187
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,790
<i>Please wait on the main concourse...</i>

188
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,758
Sure they said they were coming here?
They could've gone anywhere.

189
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,751
No, they didn't say they were taking a train.

190
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,671
They were bringing stuff to the station.

191
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,637
- Where?
- I dunno.

192
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,318
<i>- Jack?
- What?</i>

193
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,998
Over there.

194
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,991
<i>It's that guy from the funeral.</i>

195
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,559
<i>It's um...</i>

196
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,676
What's his name? Uh...

197
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,273
Alex?

198
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,754
- Hey!
- Mind!

199
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,074
<i>The Stormbreaker,</i>

200
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,390
<i>coming soon from Sayle Enterprises.</i>

201
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,677
- Look out!
- Sorry.

202
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,877
<i>The Stormbreaker,
coming soon from Sayle Enterprises.</i>

203
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,190
Whoa!

204
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,510
<i>Welcome to Arrivals.</i>

205
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,876
<i>Please remain seated,
and await docking procedure.</i>

206
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,157
Good morning.

207
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,397
Good morning, Alex.

208
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,311
Shouldn't you be at school?

209
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,157
I was at Liverpool Street Station.

210
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,991
And now I'm here.

211
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,957
That's right.

212
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,437
Morning.

213
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,478
<i>So, what is this place?</i>

214
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,232
Hogwarts?

215
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,517
I think you've probably realised
your uncle didn't work for a bank.

216
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,478
The Royal and General doesn't exist.
He worked for us.

217
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,836
- Who are you?
- My name is Mrs Jones.

218
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,912
I run the Special Operation division of Ml6.

219
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,877
Wait a minute - are you saying he lied to me?

220
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,791
He lied to everyone. Sorry.

221
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,711
Part of his job.

222
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,117
Lan Rider was one of our best agents.

223
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,351
- Until you got him killed.
- He got himself killed.

224
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,069
- It's an occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
- Not if you're a banker.

225
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,833
Mr Blunt wants to talk to you.

226
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,434
We have a proposition we'd like to make.

227
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,430
We want you to work for us.

228
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,639
You're not being serious?

229
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,109
Actually, it's not my habit to make jokes.

230
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,878
You're making one now.

231
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,072
I don't wanna be a spy.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm still at school.

232
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,071
I'll take that as a no, then.

233
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,276
What a great shame.

234
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,194
Your uncle would be very disappointed.

235
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,998
<i>- What?
- Letting him down like that.</i>

236
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,595
But then, I suppose... Young people.

237
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,399
How can you say that?
He wouldn't want me here.

238
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,040
He spent his life making sure
I never knew anything about it.

239
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,712
Really?

240
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,553
Then how do you explain...

241
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,392
...this?

242
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,598
First-rate martial arts moves.
Perfectly executed.

243
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,795
Who trained you?

244
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,110
- Nobody trained me.
- You're a first-grade dan.

245
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,474
A black belt at karate.

246
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,078
Who paid for the lessons?

247
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,718
- It was my choice.
- No.

248
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,996
All your life Ian Rider was preparing you.

249
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,878
<i>You speak French, German and Japanese.</i>

250
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,954
He took me on holiday.

251
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,998
You've been scuba-diving, mountain climbing,

252
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,911
- abseiling...
- They were my hobbies.

253
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,390
...white-water rafting,
rifle shooting, martial arts.

254
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,759
He was training you.

255
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,709
That's not how it was.

256
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,234
<i>You're trying to spoil everything.</i>

257
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,198
Please put me back in the photo booth
and show me the way out.

258
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,797
I'm surprised, really.

259
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,634
I'd have thought you'd want to get back
at the people who killed your uncle.

260
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,388
How's that erm...
housekeeper of yours, by the way?

261
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,869
What's her name? Jack Starbright.

262
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,997
I suppose she'll have started packing by now.

263
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,911
Why? What do you mean?

264
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,037
Didn't she tell you?
Her visa ran out seven years ago.

265
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,076
She'll be deported any day now.

266
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,520
Actually, we might prosecute her first.

267
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,635
<i>- Concourse level. Departures.
- Make an example.</i>

268
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,473
Working here illegally
may mean a prison sentence.

269
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,152
What are you?

270
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,277
What kind of people are you?

271
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,072
Ones that normally get their way.

272
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,436
<i>Liverpool Street concourse
now ready for departure.</i>

273
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,632
<i>Get up there!</i>

274
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,992
<i>Get up there!</i>

275
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,957
<i>Come on, now, lad. Look lively.</i>

276
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,871
<i>On your feet!</i>

277
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,997
Gentlemen, this is our latest recruit.

278
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,435
He's here for two weeks' training.

279
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,351
- Sarge?
- Don't ask me about it

280
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,158
because I don't know a thing.

281
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,117
I just do as I'm told.

282
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,958
We have no names here. We have no ranks.

283
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,473
<i>This is K Unit.</i>

284
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,473
Fox, Bear, Eagle and Wolf.

285
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,711
You'll be Cub. Get him a bed.

286
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,118
What the heck is this?

287
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,077
Jeez. It's a kid.

288
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,032
Who the heck do you think you are?

289
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,109
- A schoolboy?
- They've gotta be joking.

290
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,468
What's your name?

291
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,957
Who sent you here?

292
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,758
I can't tell you.

293
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,193
He can't tell me.

294
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,633
Course you can tell me.

295
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,631
Must be with Special Operations -

296
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,915
the only ones stupid enough
to come up with this.

297
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,115
I said...

298
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,198
I can't tell you.

299
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,993
That's very good.
Someone been teaching you self-defence?

300
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,949
Won't help you here.

301
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,951
You ain't gonna last two days.

302
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,159
<i>Get a move on, schoolboy!</i>

303
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,549
<i>Keep moving!</i>

304
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,880
Get up, you! Get up!

305
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,473
Stay with it.

306
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,437
Feel Good Inc.

307
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,992
# City's breaking down on a camel's back

308
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,554
# They just have to go cos they don't know when

309
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,119
<i>Get up! Get up!</i>

310
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,395
#... fill the streets it's appealing to see

311
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,597
# You won't get out the county
cos you're bad and free

312
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,233
<i>- Come on!
# You got a new horizon...</i>

313
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,436
- Go!
- Come on, go! Go, go!

314
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,914
That's it, Cub. Go on.

315
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,275
# And all I wanna hear is the message beep

316
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,992
# My dreams, they've got to kiss me,
because I don't get sleep

317
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,511
<i>- Ugh!
Oh, look at him!</i>

318
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,350
<i>Come on, Cub!</i>

319
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,590
<i>You're not in the playground now, Cub.</i>

320
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,715
Move it!

321
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,473
# Take it all in on your stride

322
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,189
# It is sinking, falling down
- Idiot!

323
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,874
# Love forever, love is free

324
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,629
# Let's turn forever you and me

325
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,553
# Windmill, windmill, for the land

326
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,952
# Is everybody in?

327
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,956
<i>K Unit. Stand fast.</i>

328
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,759
<i>You have failed the exercise.</i>

329
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,510
Idiot.

330
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,239
<i>- Well, well. What have we got here?
- Your mission is over.</i>

331
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,191
We're finished.

332
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,635
We've blown the whole exercise.
We'll get kicked out.

333
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,829
This is your fault. You had the map.

334
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,071
<i>Never listens to a word. Always gotta be right.</i>

335
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,549
<i>Who puts a light on
in the middle of an exercise?</i>

336
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,755
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

337
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,190
- There's a fireplace.
How did you know?

338
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,032
I saw the chimney on the way in.

339
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,792
The kid's right.

340
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,108
It's clear.

341
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,351
Sure. You think they'd leave it open
if they thought we could all climb up?

342
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,112
You can't. You're too big.

343
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,029
But I can.

344
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,233
Go on, then, Cub. Up you go.

345
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,519
<i>- All right, mate?
- Wotcha.</i>

346
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,556
- Cup of tea?
- Oh, yeah. Ta.

347
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,471
We should take that lot back to base.

348
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,437
Nah, later will be fine.

349
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,997
See ya.

350
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,355
<i>- Fancy a nice cup of tea, boys?
- Wait till I get out!</i>

351
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,714
Shut up! Sit down.

352
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,519
<i>What's that lot playing at,
having a kid with them?</i>

353
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,398
<i>I don't know. He looks like a schoolboy.
He's only about 14.</i>

354
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,710
14? Bit young for Special Forces, isn't it?

355
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,678
<i>I know. We'd better get him back to his mummy.</i>

356
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,716
<i>Probably needs a nappy change by now.</i>

357
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,718
<i>Boss? Are we moving?</i>

358
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,039
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

359
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,269
Hold on, lad!

360
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,278
Oh... Hey!

361
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,356
<i>Hold on, fellas!</i>

362
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,719
Cuts, bruises, fractured limbs.

363
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,953
It's a miracle no-one was killed.

364
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,917
Well, I'm very sorry, Major.

365
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,230
We will be talking to our man - boy.

366
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,311
He's no child, Mr Blunt.

367
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,316
He's a lethal weapon.

368
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,719
He's ready.

369
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,439
Oi!

370
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,271
Heard you were leaving.

371
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,548
Yeah, that's right.

372
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,153
What you did earlier...

373
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,957
If it weren't for you...

374
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,236
Here.

375
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,713
<i>And finally, an amazing gift
made to the British nation.</i>

376
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,998
<i>The Stormbreaker has been called</i>

377
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,595
<i>the most sophisticated personal
computer of the 21st century.</i>

378
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,990
<i>And one month ago
its multi-billionaire inventor Darrius Sayle</i>

379
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,355
<i>made his astonishing announcement.</i>

380
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,395
<i>That's right.</i>

381
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,353
<i>I'm gonna give a Stormbreaker
to every school in the country.</i>

382
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,270
<i>And while I'm at it,
I wouldn't mind giving you one too.</i>

383
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,349
<i>Really, Mr Sayle!</i>

384
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,637
- We don't trust him.
- Why not?

385
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,517
Well, we don't trust anyone.

386
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,795
It's sort of what we do.

387
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,552
We thought Sayle was too good to be true.

388
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,110
So, six months ago we put in an agent
to keep an eye on him.

389
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,872
- Are you talking about my uncle?
- Yes.

390
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,157
Sayle has a manufacturing plant in Cornwall.

391
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,516
It's built on top of what used to be a tin mine.

392
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,956
<i>Lan Rider went there as a security guard.</i>

393
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,073
<i>He sent us these images of the old mine
entrancejust outside Sayles'complex.</i>

394
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,354
In his last message to us, he mentioned a virus.

395
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,919
A computer virus?

396
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,514
He was on his way to tell us.
But he never arrived.

397
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,079
Something's going on.

398
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,948
We need to get someone to take a look around,
and this may be our last chance.

399
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,871
Why me?

400
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,075
I'll show you.

401
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,071
This is Kevin Blake.

402
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,196
He's a computer nerd.

403
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,750
Six weeks ago he won a competition
in a computer magazine.

404
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,035
Disc Drive World. Do you ever read it?

405
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,351
- No.
- The first prize was a visit to Cornwall,

406
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,271
and a chance to try out the Stormbreaker.

407
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,238
- He's due to arrive tomorrow.
- It's a PR stunt.

408
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,118
Mr Sayle is trying to show the world
what a nice man he is.

409
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,953
Get a kiddie in to look at the works.

410
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,237
Now you will take his place.

411
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,793
Yeah, but I look nothing like him.

412
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,356
<i>We've spoken to the editor.</i>

413
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,509
Huh.

414
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,593
There's just one problem.

415
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,959
I know nothing about computers
and I'm not a computer nerd.

416
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,758
But you soon will be.

417
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,119
There's only two days left.

418
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,589
There's a launch
at the Science Museum this Friday.

419
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,116
70,000 Stormbreaker computers going live.

420
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,590
Just take a look around,
but... be careful of Sayle.

421
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,391
- He may seem charming...
... but he's about as charming...

422
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,279
...as a snake.

423
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,557
<i>Just keep your eyes open and report back.</i>

424
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,119
How am I meant to do that?

425
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,636
We will give you a telecommunications device.

426
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,678
That and other... gadgets.

427
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,398
I get gadgets?

428
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,230
<i>I want one! I want one!
- Yes, thank you, sir.</i>

429
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,355
<i>Thank you.</i>

430
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,589
- I want it!
- Thank you!

431
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,715
Come on, let's go.

432
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,917
<i>Oh, you're so mean.
Unfair. I want one!</i>

433
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,195
And I suppose you want one as well, do you?

434
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,033
No. I'm looking for something
to take to Cornwall.

435
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,355
To Cornwall?

436
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,393
Follow me.

437
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,794
<i>Andrea Chicken to floor three, please.</i>

438
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,472
<i>Andrea Chicken, thank you.</i>

439
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,437
I keep my special toys down here...

440
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,075
...where children aren't allowed,
it rather pleases me to say.

441
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,276
Right. We'll start with this.

442
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,077
A yo-yo? Bit of a grandpa's toy, don't you think?

443
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,196
Oh, really? And your grandpa's yo-yo

444
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,840
had a miniaturised engine
with traction of up to 90Ibs,

445
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,311
all in a magnetised housing
with a specially-developed cord of super-nylon?

446
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,276
No.

447
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,713
- Batteries included?
- No.

448
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,074
No. I think not.

449
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,469
Now, here's something for you to keep it in.

450
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,676
- Right. What about this?
- Don't... pull that.

451
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,716
- It will deploy the parachute.
- A parachute?

452
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,308
- A parachute.
- Wow.

453
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,833
This is rather appropriate for you.

454
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,516
Oh. Zit cream?

455
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,672
Put some on your finger,
perfectly harmless, pleasantly fragranced.

456
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,955
Woody musk with top notes of citrus. But...

457
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,589
...apply it to anything metallic and...

458
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,629
...it will work its way through
up to six inches of carbonised steel.

459
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,113
Yes, now, this...

460
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,792
is called a fountain pen.

461
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,871
Not something you have much use for, I'm sure.

462
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,475
However, the nib can be fired
from a range of up to eight metres.

463
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,437
The ink is Sodium Pentathol.

464
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,911
Whomever you hit will do exactly
what you want for up to six hours.

465
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,877
- Six hours?
- Six hours.

466
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,030
I've saved the best till last.

467
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,997
It's over here. Hm.

468
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,511
- Don't do that!
- Why, is it dangerous?

469
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,749
No, it's very annoying.

470
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,870
A Nintendo DS game system,
but it's been specially modified.

471
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,430
What it does...
depends on the cartridges you insert.

472
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,308
Put in this one here and it's a PDA,
a scanner and transmitter.

473
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,595
It's how you keep in touch
if you can be bothered.

474
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,993
This one here... turns it into
a bug-finder and sonic intensifier.

475
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,550
You can hear conversations
through solid walls for up to 250 yards.

476
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,870
This one turns the whole device
into a smoke bomb.

477
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,712
There's a five-second delay.

478
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,950
That's really cool.
And what about Mariokart?

479
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,155
Mariokart...

480
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,032
...is a game.
I thought you might like it for the flight.

481
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,836
<i>May we remind you
to keep your baggage with you at all times.</i>

482
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,957
<i>Unattended baggage will be removed
and may be destroyed.</i>

483
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,758
Miss Vole? I'm the editor of Disc Drive World.

484
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,273
Then this must be Kevin.

485
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,590
- That's me.
- You should say goodbye now.

486
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,237
Well, goodbye, Kevin.

487
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,554
I hope you find your stay most informative.

488
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,312
I'm sure it will be.

489
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,872
I am Nadia Vole.

490
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,077
I work for Mr Sayle. Press and public relations.

491
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,156
A PR?

492
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,797
It is a very important job.

493
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,394
This is Port Tallon. It is a fishing village.

494
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,674
Nice place.

495
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,950
Not if you're a fish.

496
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,353
Hey. How are you?

497
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,117
- That's pretty cool, don't you think?
- Not sure I'd want one as a pet.

498
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,712
Physalia physalia.

499
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,233
That's the Portuguese man-of-war.

500
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,550
I got that beauty in the South China Sea.

501
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,030
You know, I'm happy killing exotic animals.

502
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,350
But not this one. This one I had to keep.

503
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,590
She sort of reminds me of myself.

504
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,830
99% water, no brains and no anus.

505
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,630
You know, I think I'm gonna get to like you.

506
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,116
You know why I love her?

507
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,394
I love her because...

508
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,948
...she's an outsider.

509
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,193
<i>She's silent and she's deadly.</i>

510
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,350
<i>And if you came into contact with that,</i>

511
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,350
you'd die a very memorable death.

512
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,953
I'm too young to die.

513
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,917
You're never too young to die.

514
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,797
Excuse me. Mr Sayle, you have
the American Ambassador on the line.

515
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,394
Mr Ambassador.

516
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,959
<i>How are you doing?</i>

517
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,917
<i>The answer is still no.</i>

518
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,629
<i>I'll tell him myself and I'll do it right now.</i>

519
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,713
I'm sorry. I'm not going to be able
to join you for lunch.

520
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,439
But I'm looking forward
to seeing you at dinner time.

521
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,749
It's been quite a while since I've been
face-to-face with a British schoolboy.

522
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,638
I can't wait to hear what you think
about the Stormbreaker.

523
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,553
- I'm looking forward to it, Mr Sayle.
- Oh.

524
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,838
<i>This is Mr Grin.</i>

525
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,831
It seems he's cut himself shaving.

526
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,834
Mr Grin used to be a novelty act in the circus.

527
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,037
Huh? Used to catch a spinning knife in his teeth.

528
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,556
And?

529
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,871
He lost his concentration
when his mother waved to him in the audience.

530
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,638
You take care of my boy. See you later.

531
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,431
Are you settled in, Kevin?

532
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,355
Yes, thank you.

533
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,436
It is time for you to see the Stormbreaker.

534
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,956
You are the first child to experience the power -

535
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,315
the world domination of the Stormbreaker.

536
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,870
This model has been already loaded
with highly-developed programs

537
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,309
for all aspects of the school curricula.

538
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,833
Please.

539
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,273
Does it have pinball?

540
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,713
There is no pinballs!

541
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,757
Please be still while it scans you.

542
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,916
<i>Scanning commencing.</i>

543
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,512
<i>Please stand still.</i>

544
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,558
I see you're using
a slice matrix virtual reality software.

545
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,755
Ja.

546
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,718
- Who taught you about computers?
- My uncle.

547
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,950
- He is a computer whiz-king?
- No.

548
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,112
He was a security guard. But he died.

549
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,399
How did that happen?

550
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,152
I'm not sure.

551
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,878
But I'll find out.

552
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,478
Maybe... but not today.

553
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,279
<i>Scanning complete.</i>

554
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,712
Please put on the glasses.

555
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,155
Choose a subject and press "enter" to begin.

556
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,599
<i>I will return later. Enjoy!</i>

557
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,718
<i>Place your hands on the pads.</i>

558
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,675
<i>Use your fingers to navigate.</i>

559
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,316
<i>Select category.</i>

560
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,391
<i>You have selected Space.</i>

561
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,596
<i>Press thumb key to begin.</i>

562
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,509
<i>There is no gravity in outer-space.</i>

563
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,949
<i>The Large Magellanic Cloud
is an irregular galaxy</i>

564
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,508
<i>measuring 30,000 light years across...</i>

565
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,034
<i>- Illegal interface.
... 160,000 light years away</i>

566
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,678
<i>- from Earth.
- Illegal interface.</i>

567
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,039
<i>Where is he now?</i>

568
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,758
Can't tell you. Sorry.

569
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,274
You're sorry?
What are you sorry about, sweetie?

570
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,876
Taking him out of school
or trying to turn him into some kind of spy?

571
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,236
Alex isn't a spy. He's a 14-year-old kid, lady.

572
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,390
Well, that's what makes him useful to us.

573
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,277
What happens if he gets hurt?

574
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,909
What if he's killed?
Could you live with that, Mrs Jones?

575
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,117
I worked for Ian Rider nine years.
I didn't know about any of this.

576
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,316
But I warn you, if anything happens to Alex...

577
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,833
It won't.

578
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,797
We'll take care of him. I promise.

579
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,353
By the way, he...

580
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,639
...wanted me to give you this.

581
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,359
It's your visa. It's permanent.

582
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,193
<i>Dinosaur. The name means "terrible lizard".</i>

583
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,040
<i>- 160 million years ago, these huge...
- Wow!</i>

584
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,957
<i>...creatures first roamed the Earth.</i>

585
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,875
<i>The largest carnivorous dinosaur
was the Tyrannosaurus Rex.</i>

586
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,070
<i>Each one of its teeth
was 15 centimetres long.</i>

587
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,032
<i>Good afternoon, Mr Sayle.
We've been expecting you.</i>

588
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,079
In fact, we've prepared a demonstration
for your approval.

589
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,549
Is it ready for me?

590
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,471
Yes, sir. This way, please.

591
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,469
<i>Kevin?</i>

592
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,035
Kevin?

593
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,715
I hope this satisfies your requirements.

594
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,990
This is a scale model
of the rooftop at your London HQ.

595
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,115
<i>I've incorporated a powerful
nationwide transmitter</i>

596
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,555
<i>that will give you manual override.</i>

597
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,915
In other words, a backup system.

598
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,632
This backup system...

599
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,555
it will send out a signal that will instantly activate
all 70,000 computers.

600
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,517
<i>Of course, it shouldn't be needed.</i>

601
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,431
<i>Is it all right, sir?</i>

602
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,714
It's excellent.

603
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,357
It's very good.

604
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,759
<i>Warning. R-5 injection now in progress.</i>

605
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,877
What are you doing down here, Kevin?

606
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,713
I was just... wondering
where this went, Miss Vole.

607
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,079
- What is that place?
- This area is restricted.

608
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,037
This way, please.

609
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,079
OK.

610
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,673
I was brought up on...

611
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,428
...the wrong side of the tracks,
in a very dark place.

612
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,117
It was terrible. It was very nasty.

613
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,589
I still have the nightmares.

614
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,830
<i>- What happened?
- I was lucky. I got out.</i>

615
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,515
My mother won a million dollars
on the state lottery.

616
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,478
She had me educated
in the best schooling system in the world -

617
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,993
right here in your country.

618
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,355
You were at school with the Prime Minister.

619
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,959
<i>That's right.</i>

620
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,715
And he treated me with the same kindness
as all the others in my class.

621
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,752
<i>This is the number, Miss Vole.</i>

622
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,832
And this phone is registered
to an address in Chelsea.

623
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,358
<i>Tell me,</i>

624
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,317
did you like the Stormbreaker?

625
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,473
Yeah, it was cool.

626
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,993
Cool?

627
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,389
Come on, man. Is that all you can say?

628
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,189
It strikes me that you don't talk very much.

629
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,794
I mean, I know you're the strong, silent type.

630
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,155
You don't even seem
like a computer enthusiast.

631
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,832
You don't look like one either.

632
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,232
<i>That's funny, Mr Sayle,</i>

633
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,956
cos I think I'd say the same about you.

634
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,032
Well, hey... you got a point, son.

635
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,714
Listen, I very much enjoyed meeting you.

636
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,075
And I'm sure you'll have a lot to talk about
when you get back to school.

637
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,435
<i>And when we launch
the Stormbreakers tomorrow,</i>

638
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,593
I'll be thinking particularly of you.

639
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,312
Enjoy the grub.

640
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,555
<i>Do not let the spines puncture your skin.</i>

641
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,677
<i>It can result in vomiting,
fever or even death.</i>

642
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,399
<i>Though a great delicacy
in Japanese restaurants,</i>

643
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,074
<i>the Fugu fish is one of the...</i>

644
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,519
Excuse me.

645
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,830
I am looking for a person called Jack.

646
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,829
- Is this about Alex?
- You are a friend of Alex?

647
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,797
Sort of. I look after him.

648
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,233
This is Alex.

649
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,957
- So?
- And this man with him?

650
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,713
- His father?
- What is going on?

651
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,792
Tell me, who is this boy? What is he doing?

652
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,314
- Who are you?
- Who is he working for?

653
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,628
Wait!

654
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,115
Alright Alright

655
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,872
Yah! Yah!

656
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,112
# Now I feel like breaking laws

657
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,795
# Go start a civil war...

658
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,437
# Now I feel like dropping bombs

659
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,510
# Black out your house
if you're at home...

660
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,397
<i>Good night.</i>

661
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,793
Ah, Mr Gregorovich. I'm glad you can join us.

662
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,071
I didn't know you were gonna come in person.

663
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,071
<i>This is the last batch.</i>

664
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,312
My people wanted to be assured
that the operation had gone according to plan.

665
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,120
Oh, your people.
It's my plan. It's my operation.

666
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,668
Why would your people think
anything could go wrong?

667
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,389
Stand back
- You stupid idiot!

668
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,713
It's OK.

669
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,316
The container is not compromised.

670
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,549
Sorry. I won't do that again.

671
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,077
No. You won't.

672
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,315
My people don't like mistakes.

673
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,437
Well, I ain't got all night.
Let's go to work, boys.

674
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,588
<i>Back to work! All of you!</i>

675
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,436
This just came from Alex Rider.

676
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,953
Yassen Gregorovich.

677
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,439
It has to be.

678
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,351
I thought he was still in North Korea.

679
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,668
Obviously not.

680
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,557
This is the proof we need.

681
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,870
The Stormbreaker launch
is in less than 24 hours.

682
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,916
- Cancel it.
- Yes, you're right.

683
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,194
For once.

684
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,157
I'll put a call in to Downing Street.

685
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,832
- Get Alex out.
- There's no need.

686
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,592
He'll be on a plane at 12:00 tomorrow.

687
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,319
You can meet him if you like -
take him for an ice cream.

688
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,476
Well, he's done very well. He deserves a treat.

689
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,879
Ah, Alex Rider.

690
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,835
I suspected him from the moment he arrived.

691
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,708
And his uncle was Ian Rider,
the security guard that was actually a spy.

692
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,157
<i>I want you to go to his room.</i>

693
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,832
<i>I want you to wake him up...</i>

694
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,114
<i>gently.</i>

695
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,518
Then I want you to kill him.

696
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,756
You've got to be kidding.

697
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,877
<i>Warning: R-5 injection now in progress.</i>

698
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,078
<i>Warning: R-5 injection now in progress.</i>

699
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,951
<i>Warning: R-5 injection now in progress.</i>

700
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,317
What are you doing here?

701
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,519
Who are you?

702
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,636
I'm Kevin Blake. I was invited here.

703
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,712
It's a good act. You do it very well.

704
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,238
But you should not have come here.

705
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,518
We can talk.

706
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,556
I don't think so.

707
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,116
Yes, we can.

708
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,791
Don't drop that.

709
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,673
R-5. What is it?

710
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,719
Put... it... back.

711
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,312
The way out.

712
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,234
Now.

713
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,876
<i>Intruder alert. Intruder alert.</i>

714
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,752
<i>Alert. Intruder, level 8.</i>

715
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,397
<i>Security to level 8.</i>

716
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,995
Going somewhere?

717
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,798
<i>Kevin?</i>

718
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,837
If this is how you treat the winner,
I'd hate to be the runner-up.

719
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,832
You're not Kevin Blake. You're Alex Rider.

720
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,718
Your uncle was pretending to be a security man.

721
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,870
Yassen Gregorovich dealt with him.

722
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,432
<i>That's right.</i>

723
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,670
And Ml6 sent you to take his place?

724
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,117
Shame on those people,
sending a 14-year-old boy to do their dirty work.

725
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,239
Not very British, I'd have said.
Not very cricket, no.

726
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,710
What are you doing here? Why are you
putting a virus into the Stormbreaker?

727
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,395
It's not a computer virus.

728
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,428
It's the real thing.

729
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,157
It's called R-5.

730
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,071
It's been genetically modified.

731
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,677
Why are you doing this?

732
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,116
Do you know what it's like
to be a foreigner in this country?

733
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,634
For me, son, that was slow death.

734
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,788
It wasn't pretty. I was mocked,
I was derided from the day I arrived here.

735
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,711
Especially at school.

736
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,473
<i>The kids weren't very nice. Kids can be cruel.</i>

737
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,594
Man, they called me "trailer boy".

738
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,957
Do I look like a trailer boy to you?

739
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:43,950
Huh?

740
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,917
Darrius Smell.

741
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,275
That's what they called me.
Do you know why?

742
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,999
- Because you didn't wash?
- It's OK.

743
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,632
<i>It's because they were snobs.</i>

744
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,597
I hated all of them.

745
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,557
They made my life miserable.

746
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,029
And there was one kid, one kid in particular.

747
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,997
Do you know who this kid grew up to be?

748
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,993
The Prime Minister. That's who.

749
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,558
Hey, look, I'm used to it.
My whole life I've been treated that way.

750
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,197
So this is what it's all about?

751
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,550
<i>- Revenge?
- Revenge can be good.</i>

752
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,397
Because in a few hours,
at the Science Museum,

753
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:26,118
my old friend the Prime Minister,
he's gonna press a button

754
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,758
and you know what's gonna happen?

755
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:34,309
That button's gonna connect
all the Stormbreakers on my wireless network.

756
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,591
And at the same moment,
it's gonna release a virus

757
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,468
straight into the classes
packed with British schoolchildren.

758
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,313
You're going to kill
thousands of innocent people.

759
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,277
Oh, no. Of course not.

760
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,555
I'm gonna kill millions.

761
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,592
You're not being serious.

762
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,318
So you were bullied.

763
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,036
<i>Lots of people are bullied,</i>

764
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,680
but it doesn't change them
into raging psychopaths.

765
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,436
You should be careful how you talk to me.

766
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,519
That was a good shot.

767
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,113
Actually, it was a near-miss.

768
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:18,309
Listen, Alex, I'd love to hang out here
and shoot the breeze with you,

769
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,678
but I've got a rather important appointment,
so I'm gonna leave you to Nadia.

770
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,990
I'll see you guys when it's over.

771
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,119
Cheerio, old boy.

772
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,513
They won't listen to us.

773
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:40,670
You know the Government view on Intelligence.

774
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,637
They'd sooner trust a Ouija board.

775
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,995
They're going ahead with the ceremony.

776
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,833
- What about security?
- A net around the Museum,

777
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,672
but it may be beside the point.

778
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,479
What about Alex?
He wasn't on the 12 o'clock plane.

779
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,550
Let's hope he can look after himself.

780
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,957
Let me out.

781
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,554
The jellyfish cannot attack you, Alex.

782
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,995
It has, as you said, no brains.

783
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,399
But you will tire soon.

784
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,392
You will drift into its embrace, and then...

785
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,277
A souvenir for Mr Sayle.

786
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,513
Say cheese.

787
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,839
What are you doing?

788
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,479
Verdammtes Kind!

789
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,916
<i>Mr Grin, you have received clearance
from French Air Control.</i>

790
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,234
Sabina, remember to keep your heels down.

791
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,315
Mr Grin?

792
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,229
Mr Grin?

793
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,069
All right, Mr Grin, I want you to fly me
to London as fast as you can.

794
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,152
<i>It's red button day.</i>

795
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,834
<i>In a few minutes,
the Prime Minister will press the button</i>

796
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,799
<i>to activate the Stormbreaker computers
in schools nationwide.</i>

797
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:25,158
<i>Darrius Sayle has insisted that the Prime
Minister be the one to press the button.</i>

798
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:28,038
<i>In fact, he's made it
button fingerprint-sensitive,</i>

799
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,997
<i>so nobody else can take his place.</i>

800
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,958
<i>Let's cross live now to the Science Museum.</i>

801
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,432
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

802
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,677
<i>the Stormbreaker will be launched
in five minutes.</i>

803
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,953
- Where's Alex?
- We don't know.

804
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,996
You promised to look after him.

805
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,755
- We don't have time for this now.
- What do you mean? Where's Alex?

806
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,073
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Darrius Sayle.</i>

807
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,517
The message is clear.

808
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,437
Education, education,

809
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:35,873
and...

810
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,634
...education,

811
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:42,750
which is why I am delighted to accept
the most generous offer

812
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,876
from one of our foremost entrepreneurs

813
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,430
and, indeed, an old school... colleague of mine,

814
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,794
Darrius Smell.

815
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,757
Sayle.

816
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,717
Darrius Sayle.

817
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:13,191
Oh, I'm just so glad to be here,

818
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,077
<i>with my...</i>

819
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,196
my dear friend, the Prime Minister.

820
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:23,196
I'm gonna tell you, the Prime Minister
is the one who must take credit

821
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,430
<i>for what's about to happen here.</i>

822
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,440
<i>My Stormbreakers
are about to transform the lives</i>

823
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,351
<i>of every child in this country.</i>

824
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,757
<i>And let me tell you,</i>

825
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,479
<i>this is a day that none of you...</i>

826
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,232
...will ever forget.

827
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,199
<i>And now I shall ask my old friend
to press this button that'll send a signal</i>

828
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,636
<i>that'll activate the Stormbreakers
across this entire nation.</i>

829
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,231
<i>20 seconds to Stormbreaker launch.</i>

830
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,112
<i>Stand by, all schools.</i>

831
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,349
Here we go.

832
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,229
Ten!

833
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,150
Nine!

834
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:01,670
Eight!

835
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,749
Seven!

836
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,795
Six!

837
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,310
Five!

838
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,550
Four!

839
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,070
Three!

840
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,196
Two!

841
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:16,277
One!

842
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:25,868
Give me that.

843
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,951
- Red alert. Secure the area.
- No! Wait!

844
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,198
Hold your fire. He's with us.

845
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:43,598
Keep calm. He's unarmed.

846
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,037
<i>- Cub?
- Wolf?</i>

847
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,189
He's with us.

848
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,909
Come on. Press it.

849
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,797
- Give me the gun.
- Press the button.

850
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:52,790
Now!

851
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,518
Get down. Now!

852
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,352
Don't panic. Everything's under control.

853
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,913
- Darrius...
- You twerp.

854
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,239
Prime Minister!

855
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:12,833
Get out of my way.

856
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:24,992
How could you let him slip away?

857
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:28,516
You do realise, Alex,
you nearly shot the Prime Minister?

858
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,318
Congratulations are in order.

859
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,755
Yes, he's done very well, but it's time to go.

860
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,035
- What about Sayle?
- You can leave him to us.

861
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,439
Right.

862
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,633
I can't believe
I let you get mixed up in all this.

863
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,472
But it's over. I'm taking you home.

864
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,118
Where's he going?

865
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:52,273
To some remote and far away land
where no-one will ever find him -

866
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,634
like Paraguay.

867
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,597
Or Iowa.

868
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,194
Have you got the phone number
of that hunky soldier?

869
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,679
- Jack.
- Do they have numbers?

870
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,591
- Jack! That's it!
- What?

871
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:04,433
That's Sayle Tower.
I saw a model of the rooftop in Cornwall.

872
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:07,318
He was talking about a backup.
Something to do with a...

873
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,231
a manual override.

874
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,550
He's gonna set off the virus himself.

875
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,593
Come on, come on, come on!
The traffic in this city!

876
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,352
- We're not gonna make it.
- Come on.

877
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,028
Come on.

878
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,468
Sabina?

879
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,315
Alex?

880
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:29,717
Sabina.

881
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,392
Alex.

882
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,397
Can you put me through to Mrs Jones?

883
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,913
I don't know her first name.

884
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,798
I'm not sending her a birthday card.
It's an emergency.

885
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,275
Hello?

886
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,237
Ready Steady Go

887
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,835
Third company, left wheel!

888
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,958
Keep going.

889
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,912
# Ready steady go

890
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,712
- Come back here!
- After them!

891
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,756
- Come on!
- Shoulder to shoulder!

892
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,796
- Hold it steady!
- Charge!

893
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,394
- Don't look back.
- Why not?

894
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,674
Trust me.

895
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,349
# Ready... go

896
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:28,870
Whoa!

897
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,076
# Yo, ready

898
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,355
# Ready, ready

899
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,917
# Yo, ready steady go

900
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,271
# Ready steady go

901
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,588
If anyone comes in, kill 'em.

902
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,277
# Ready steady go

903
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,349
# Ready... go

904
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:47,595
Hyah!

905
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,079
Yass.

906
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,871
Schoolboy trick.

907
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,914
Stop!

908
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,353
<i>Sorry.</i>

909
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,477
Move yourselves! Over here! Move!

910
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,790
- They're in there.
He's on the roof.

911
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,598
Don't you dare hurt them!

912
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,312
Take up positions.

913
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,753
Get up there! Go!

914
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,998
<i>Loading complete.</i>

915
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,072
<i>- Power failure.
- Mmm.</i>

916
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,876
<i>Satellite link interrupted.</i>

917
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,877
<i>Put it down, boy.</i>

918
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,198
I said put it down.

919
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,871
Come on, come on!

920
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,639
Stay away!

921
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,230
Do you have um... eyeball?

922
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:42,597
Target acquired.
We can take them... now.

923
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,910
- Fire at my command.
- No, don't hurt Alex!

924
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,070
This isn't only about Alex.
Prepare to fire.

925
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,309
No, wait.

926
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,550
This is not the time for an argument.

927
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,949
<i>Alan! There is no argument.</i>

928
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,557
<i>Stand down.
- Stand down.</i>

929
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,114
Back off!

930
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,550
Whooaahh...

931
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,319
No!

932
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,317
- Hang on!
- You know what got me?

933
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,277
What really got me?

934
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,759
They send a boy.

935
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,513
I don't wanna rock your boat, sonny,
but the party's over.

936
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,236
Adios.

937
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,548
<i>Prepare to fire.</i>

938
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,550
Sabina, I'm gonna swing you onto the balcony.

939
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:32,589
Alex, don't! The cable will break.

940
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:33,999
I can do it.

941
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,275
No!

942
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,119
Need a hand?

943
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,396
Ohh!

944
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,113
Why?

945
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,590
Sayle had become an embarrassment
to the people I work for.

946
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,318
What about me?

947
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,073
I had no instructions concerning you.

948
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,753
This doesn't change anything.

949
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,673
You killed my uncle.
You're still my enemy.

950
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,149
I have a lot of enemies.

951
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:53,669
- This isn't over.
- Yes, Alex... it is.

952
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,638
Go back to school.

953
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,433
You don't belong to the same world as me.

954
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,157
You should forget about me.

955
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,557
I'll never forget you.

956
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,076
Ah, it's your choice.

957
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,873
<i>You know they made me sign
the Official Secrets Act?</i>

958
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,030
I'm not allowed to tell anyone
what happened.

959
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,997
Me, too.

960
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,957
- Are you really a spy?
- No.

961
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,079
That's not what they told me.

962
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,549
No, I'm not a spy.
And it won't happen again.

963
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,358
- No?
- No.

964
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,237
I'm just me.

965
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,911
Glad To Be Here

966
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,075
# You're waiting for the night to come

967
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:00,275
# Your eyes start shining
as the sun begins to fall

968
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,874
# The feeling something's going on

969
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:08,710
# An unseen gravity starts pulling you along

970
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:12,311
# Someone's by your side

971

# Can you feel it take a look around?

973
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,070
# Can't you hear it?

974
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,116
# Sure is good to be here

975
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,236
# There's no reason

976
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,639
# We can't get off the ground

977
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,473
# So come on, throw your hands up

978
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,994
# Sure is good to be here with you

979
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,194
# Sure is good to be here with you

980
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,437
# Your feet are lifting off the ground

981
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:51,550
# Floating weightless
as you're held up by the crowd

982
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,713
# Reaction speeds up then slows down

983
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,269
# You feel like screaming
but you cannot hear a sound

984
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:04,633
# Senses come alive
take you on a ride

985
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:08,474
# Delivers you to something
that has been away too long

986
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:12,437
