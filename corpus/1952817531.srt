125
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:48,727
        I COULD'VE PULLED
        OUT MONTHS AGO.

126
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,729
        YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
        GOTTEN THE BIG HOUSE

127
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:52,097
        OR THE EXTRA ALLOWANCE
        FOR THE SPOUSE.

128
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:53,599
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

129
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,234

130
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:56,735
            YOU'LL BE EATING
            WHITE BREAD.

131
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:58,237
            YOU'LL PROBABLY
            EVEN LIKE IT.

132
00:05:58,305 --> 00:06:00,272

            WITH EGG SALAD.

133
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,107
IT'S BETTER
THAN THE SLAMMER.

134
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:04,042
        KEEP TELLING YOURSELF
        THAT, SWEETHEART.

135
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,878
        YOU MIGHT BELIEVE IT
        AFTER A WHILE.

136
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:09,248
        AND STAY OUT OF MY PURSE
        WHILE I'M ON THE PHONE.

137
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:12,284
I WASN'T IN YOUR PURSE.

138
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:13,285
                YES, YOU WERE!

139
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:14,820
YOU'RE ALWAYS
ACCUSING ME.

00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:18,156
        PUT THE VISA CARD BACK
        IN MY PURSE, VINNIE.

        YOU KNOW WHAT

145
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:44,149
NO IDEA. I HAVEN'T MET
A CRIMINAL IN YEARS.

146
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:46,885
        HE TRIED TO TIP ME.

                    100 BUCKS?

150
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:52,391
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

151
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:53,892
THE POINT IS THE MAN
PROFFERED A GRATUITY.

152
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,294
IT'S AGAINST PROTOCOL.
I CAN'T ACCEPT THAT.

153
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:56,795
        NO, I KNOW YOU CAN'T.

154
00:06:56,862 --> 00:06:58,330
NOT TO MENTION
IT WAS INSULTING.

155
00:06:58,398 --> 00:06:59,798
    TASK COMPLETED,
    COOPERSMITH?

156
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:01,300
            YES, SIR.

157
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,302
        THIS ISN'T GOING TO TAKE
        A LOT OF MY TIME.

158
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:05,304
        THIS GUY'S LIVING IN
        THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

159
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:07,339
        IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
        I COULD TAKE ON

160
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:09,141
        IN ADDITION TO
        MY REGULAR DUTIES, SIR.

161
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:10,309
COOPERSMITH,

162
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:11,977
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT GOVERNMENT WITNESS.

163
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:14,813
WHEN YOU'VE DELIVERED HIM
TO HIS 2 COURT APPEARANCES,

164
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,315
THEN WE'LL TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

165
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:17,949
NOT BEFORE.

166
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:20,986
                VERY GOOD, SIR.

167
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:23,822
                [SIGHS]

168
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:25,324
            BACK TO
            THE DANGEROUS WORLD

169
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:26,825
            OF FHA FRAUD.

170
00:07:26,892 --> 00:07:30,329
            I DON'T WANT TO FILL
            OUT ANY MORE FORMS.

171
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:32,331
            I WANT
            TO GO UNDERCOVER.

172
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:34,333
            I WANT TO STAKE OUT
            SOME SON OF A BITCH

173
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,335
        IN A FARMHOUSE IN
        THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE

174
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:38,170
            AND EAT A LOT
            OF TAKEOUT FOOD.

175
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:39,671
            I WANT TO WEAR
            A WINDBREAKER.

176
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:41,340
ONCE, WHEN
I WAS UNDERCOVER,

177
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:43,842
I GOT TO DRIVE A BMW.

178
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:46,345
                I KNOW.

179
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:47,846
I CAN'T HELP IT.

180
00:07:47,913 --> 00:07:49,848
        IT WAS THE HIGH POINT
        OF MY LIFE.

181
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:55,987
        I'M GETTING BACK
        INTO UNDERCOVER WORK.

182
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:58,490
FORGET IT, KIRBY.
IT'S AGAINST REGULATIONS.

183
00:07:58,558 --> 00:07:59,491
THERE'S OVERTIME INVOLVED.

184
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:02,494
YOU CAN'T CATCH CRIMINALS
IN THE FBI

185
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:03,862
IF THERE'S OVERTIME
INVOLVED.

186
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:05,364
                SOMETHING
                COULD CHANGE.

187
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:06,365
                THINGS CHANGE.

188
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:07,533
YEAH. RIGHT.

189
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:12,638

    ALL SPORTS RADIO.

190
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:14,373
        WE'RE TALKING
    ABOUT LAST NIGHT'S GAME.

191
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,642
    ANOTHER HEARTBREAKING LOSS
        BY THE HOME TEAM.

192
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,977
    THE PADS, WAY AHEAD,
    LOST IN THE NINTH

193
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:21,980
    WHEN WALLY BUNTING WALKED
    IN THE WINNING RUN.

194
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:24,749
    FANS, WHAT ARE WE GOING
    TO DO ABOUT WALLY BUNTING?

                    BARNEY.

196

WALLY. TOO BAD.

197
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:44,386
COULD'VE HAPPENED
TO ANYBODY, RIGHT?

198
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:46,504
            YEAH. I GUESS SO.

199
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:47,806
RELIEF PITCHING.

200
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:49,241
IT'S A HIGH-RISK
OCCUPATION.

201
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:51,409
ANYBODY COULD BLOW
A 7-RUN LEAD.

202

207
00:08:58,484 --> 00:08:59,918
I'M SORRY, WALLY.

208
00:08:59,985 --> 00:09:01,420
 I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

209
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:03,555
MARGARET WILL MISS YOU,
TOO. I'M SURE.

210
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:05,424
I MEAN, THERAPISTS
AREN'T SUPPOSED TO SAY

211
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:07,259
THAT THEY'LL MISS
THEIR PATIENTS,

212
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,560
SO HOW DO I KNOW?

213
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:10,429

214
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:12,397

217
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:20,038
                    TO WICHITA.

218
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:22,173
WHY ON EARTH
WOULD YOU GO TO WICHITA?

219
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,514
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

220
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:30,749

            BARNEY,

00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,554

            NO FUN HERE.

 YOU GET THE CAR WASHED

YOU GET YOUR HAIR CUT

228
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:47,466
YOU NEVER EVER
GET A DIFFERENT CUT.

229
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:48,967
                LOOK AT HOW YOU
                EAT PANCAKES.

230
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:50,969
    WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE WAY
    I EAT PANCAKES?

HOW DOES
HE EAT PANCAKES?

232
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,473
            HE HAS A SYSTEM
            FOR EATING PANCAKES.

233
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,974
    SO THE BOTTOM PANCAKE

00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,181
            HERE'S A FORM FOR
            OUR SUGGESTION BOX.

302
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:24,683
            IF THERE'S ANYTHING
            YOU WANT

303
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:26,184
            THAT WE DON'T HAVE,

304
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:27,819
            YOU JUST
            LET US KNOW.

305
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:30,188
ARUGULA.

306
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:32,658
I HAVEN'T HAD ARUGULA
IN 6 WEEKS.

307
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:33,659
                    WHAT'S THAT?

308
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:36,628
IT'S A VEGETABLE.

309
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:42,500
            [SIREN]

310
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:44,202
        Police radio:
    CAR 274 TO HEADQUARTERS.

311
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,204
     CAR 274 TO HEADQUARTERS.

312
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:50,942
    MALE SUBJECT APPREHENDED
DRIVING STOLEN GREEN CHRYSLER.

313
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:53,711
            HEY, HANNAH,

314
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:55,546
        GOT A GRAND THEFT AUTO
        JUST WAITING FOR YOU.

315
00:13:55,614 --> 00:13:57,048
LET ME AT HIM.

316
00:13:57,116 --> 00:13:58,716
        AND LET ME KNOW WHEN
        YOU'RE DONE WITH HIM,

317
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:00,218
        BECAUSE I COULD USE HIM.

318
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:02,220
    HE MAKES THE HAIRS ON
    THE BACK MY NECK STAND UP.

319
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:03,921
THE HAIRS ON THE BACK
OF YOUR NECK?

320
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,922
                        YES.

321
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:07,425
THAT HAS NEVER
HAPPENED TO ME.

322
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:09,927
I'VE NEVER BEEN INTERESTED
IN ANYONE ON ANY LEVEL

323
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:11,429
UNLESS I KNOW...

324
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:13,064
            IF HE'S A COLLEGE
            GRADUATE.

325
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:14,199
    YES.

326
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:17,202
OK, THAT PROBABLY SEEMS
QUITE COMICAL TO YOU.

327
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:18,970
                IT'S YOUR LIFE.
                SUIT YOURSELF.

328
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:20,472
    I DID...

329
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:22,440
AND LOOK
WHERE IT GOT ME.

330
00:14:35,187 --> 00:14:38,990
            TOD WILKINSON,
            I'M HANNAH STUBBS.

331
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:41,159
            I'M THE ASSISTANT
            DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

332
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:43,228
HOW YOU
TWO GIRLS DOING?

333
00:14:43,295 --> 00:14:44,262
                WHAT ROBBERY?

334
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,031
                I BORROWED
                A GUY'S CAR.

335
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:49,534
HE GAVE YOU THE KEYS.
IS THAT CORRECT?

336
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:52,370
        HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
        LEAVE THEM IN THE CAR.

337
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:53,371
BUT HE DIDN'T.

338
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,273
            RIGHT.
            IF HE'D LEFT THEM,

339
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:57,642
            I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD
            TO JUMP START IT.

340
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:00,578
HOW DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
HOW TO JUMP START A CAR?

341
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:02,680
        I LEARNED IT
        IN THE ARMY.

342
00:15:02,748 --> 00:15:05,316
        I WAS IN THE MOTOR POOL,

343
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:07,419
        AND EVERYONE WAS ALWAYS
        LOSING THEIR KEYS.

344
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:10,221
        THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES
        ARMY WOULDN'T HAVE MOVED

345
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:12,190
        HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR ME
        JUMP STARTING IT.

346
00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:15,493
        AND IT CAME IN HANDY
        ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS--

347
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:20,365
        JUMP STARTING AMBULANCES
        IN ORDER TO GET INVALIDS

348
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:23,034
        TO THE DIALYSIS
        MACHINES.

349
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:33,211
WHAT WAS
THE NAME OF, UM...

350
00:15:34,713 --> 00:15:36,013
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

351
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:37,715
                EDDIE.

352
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:38,783
EDDIE WHAT?

353
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,419
        THAT'S ALL I KNOW.
        HE DRIVES A BLUE NOVA.

354
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:43,654
YOU WEREN'T PICKED UP
IN A BLUE NOVA.

355
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:45,022
IT WAS A GREEN CHRYSLER.

356
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:48,326
            OH. WELL,
            THAT EXPLAINS IT.

357
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:51,129
            I JUMP STARTED
            THE WRONG CAR.

358
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:53,398
            I WAS IN A HURRY.

359
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:55,666
            I WAS ON MY WAY
            TO CHURCH

360
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:58,035
            TO SAY SOME NOVENAS
            FOR THANKSGIVING.

361
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:00,238
THANKSGIVING IS NOT
A CATHOLIC HOLIDAY.

362
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:03,174
        THANKSGIVING IS VERY BIG
        WITH THE ITALIANS.

363
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:06,677
        TURKEY CACCIATORE,
        SWEET POTATO PARMIGIAN--

364
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:10,014
THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS THANKSGIVING IN ITALY!

365
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,516
IT'S AN AMERICAN HOLIDAY.

366
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,284
AND I'VE BEEN TO ITALY--

367
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:14,519
            TO FLORENCE, RIGHT?

368
00:16:14,587 --> 00:16:15,553
    YES.

369
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,955
            EVER BEEN TO SICILY,
            BY ANY CHANCE?

370
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:19,224
    NO.

371
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:23,328
        THANKSGIVING
        IS VERY BIG IN SICILY

372
00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:26,297
        ON ACCOUNT OF THE LARGE
        NUMBER OF SICILIANS

373
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:27,798
        WHO WENT TO AMERICA

374
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:30,468
        AND THEN GOT THROWN
        BACK OUT.

375
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,904
THERE WERE 2 CASES
OF LIQUOR

376
00:16:33,972 --> 00:16:35,607
IN THE BACK SEAT
OF THAT CAR.

377
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:36,974
        PEOPLE DRINK TOO MUCH.

378
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:38,843
THOSE 2 CASES OF LIQUOR

379
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,878
WERE REPORTED STOLEN
FROM KELLY'S LIQUOR

380
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:42,813
ON FIFTH STREET
EARLIER TODAY.

381
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:44,315
        YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

382
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:47,218
        I ACCIDENTALLY BORROWED
        THE WRONG CAR

383
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:50,755
        OF A GUY WHO STOLE SOME
        LIQUOR EARLIER TODAY?

384
00:16:50,822 --> 00:16:52,257
THE CAR YOU STOLE

385
00:16:52,324 --> 00:16:55,826
BELONGS TO THE REVEREND
MALCOLM DICKENSON.

386
00:16:55,894 --> 00:16:59,664
HE IS THE MINISTER
OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH

387
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:01,366
HERE IN FRYBURG!

388
00:17:07,072 --> 00:17:09,940
        ARE YOU SURE
        HE'S A MINISTER?

389
00:17:10,008 --> 00:17:12,843
        ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS
        MAKES HIS LIVING

390
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:14,745
        AS A COMPLETELY
        PHONY MINISTER.

391
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:16,247
        FOR 2 BUCKS,

392
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:18,049
         I CAN MAKE <i>YOU</i>
         A MINISTER.

393
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:20,051
        SOME GUYS
        STEAL YOUR MONEY,

394
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:23,188
        BUT THESE GUYS,
        THEY STEAL YOUR HEART.

395
00:17:36,752 --> 00:17:38,486
NOW? CAN YOU SEE HIM?

396
00:17:38,554 --> 00:17:39,821
WHAT'S THE LICENSE NUMBER?

397
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:41,656
                    MA'AM?
    E-N-4--

398
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:43,157
OH, UH,
DOWN THE HALL,

399
00:17:43,225 --> 00:17:44,459
ONE FLIGHT UP
TO YOUR LEFT.

400
00:17:44,526 --> 00:17:46,394
                    THANK YOU.
    E-N-4.

401
00:17:46,462 --> 00:17:47,829
                CALL ME VINNIE.

402
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:49,848
IT SAYS HERE
YOUR NAME'S TOD.

403
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:52,217
    BARNEY COOPERSMITH, FBI.

404
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:56,020
HANNAH STUBBS OF THE
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.

405
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:57,322
        WHAT'S GOING ON, VINNIE?

406
00:17:57,389 --> 00:18:00,124
    YOU'VE GOT A RING OF PHONY
    MINISTERS STEALING LIQUOR.

407
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:01,425
    MAKE ME A MINISTER.

408
00:18:01,493 --> 00:18:03,427
    I'LL GO UNDERCOVER,
    INFILTRATE THEM.

409
00:18:03,495 --> 00:18:04,996
    WE'LL NAIL ALL THESE--

410
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:06,364
            OK, KNOCK IT OFF.
            WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

411
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:09,000
GRAND THEFT AUTO.
FELONY THEFT.

412
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:11,169
                WHERE'S THE CAR
                WE GAVE YOU?

413
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:14,038
    IF I KNEW, I WOULDN'T HAVE
    BORROWED THE OTHER ONE.

414
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:15,406
WE'RE ARRAIGNING HIM
IN THE MORNING.

415
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:16,407
                NO, YOU'RE NOT.

416
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:17,909
WE MOST
CERTAINLY ARE.

417
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:18,977
                THIS MAN

418
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:20,811
            IS IN THE FEDERAL
            WITNESS PROGRAM.

419
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,146
            HE'S UNDER
            THE PROTECTION

420
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:23,547
                OF THE FBI.

421
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,983
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY PURSE?

422
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,050
        JUST LOOKING.
        CUTE KIDS.

423
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:27,051
THANK YOU.

424
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,786
        BASEBALL FANS?
YES.

425
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:30,889
    THAT'S YOUR HUSBAND?

426
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:33,157
NOT ANYMORE.

427
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,227
            COME ON, VINNIE.
            LET'S GO.

428
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:40,698
            YOU'RE
            A GOOD-LOOKING GIRL,

429
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:42,533
            EXCEPT FOR
            THOSE ARMY SHOES.

430
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:44,035
            NO WONDER HE SPLIT.

431
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:45,103
                        COME ON.

432
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:48,439
        YOU OUGHT TO GET A PAIR
        OF NICE HIGH HEELS.

433
00:18:48,507 --> 00:18:50,909
        SPECTATOR PUMPS,
        I THINK THEY'RE CALLED.

434
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:52,443
    WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

435
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:54,578
THIS MAN IS A MEMBER

436
00:18:54,646 --> 00:18:56,014
                OF AN ORGANIZED
                CRIME FAMILY.

437
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:57,681
THEY PUT THAT STAMP
ON EVERYBODY.

438
00:18:57,749 --> 00:18:59,350
IT'S A STEREOTYPE,
AND I RESENT IT.

439
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:01,752
        HE HAS TO TESTIFY
        AT 2 MAJOR MOB TRIALS

440
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,521
        IN NEW YORK IN
        THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE,

441
00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:07,058
        SO THEREFORE YOU ARE NOT
        GOING TO ARRAIGN HIM

442
00:19:07,126 --> 00:19:08,526
        FOR ANYTHING TOMORROW.

443
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:11,662
            NOW WAIT
            JUST A MINUTE.

444
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,898
            THIS IS NOT
            A DUMP SITE

445
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:16,734
            FOR THE TOXIC WASTE
            OF CRIMINAL AMERICA.

446
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:18,369
                THAT'S
                MY LAST MINT.

447
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:19,870
        SPIT THAT OUT!

448
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:23,207
        SPIT THAT OUT AND
        RETURN IT TO THIS WOMAN!

449
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:42,226
BRING HIM BACK HERE!

450
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:44,562
            LADY, THIS MAN IS
            MUCH MORE IMPORTANT

451
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:47,065
            THAN A COUPLE
            OF PETTY LARCENIES.

452
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:49,067
THAT'S YOUR OPINION.
YOU DON'T LIVE HERE.

453
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:51,569
        BUT IF I DID, IT WOULD
        BE COMFORTING TO KNOW

454
00:19:51,636 --> 00:19:53,071
        A NARROW-MINDED FANATIC

455
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:54,772
        IS LOOKING OUT
        FOR THIS COMMUNITY.

456
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,007
                OH, REALLY?

457
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:57,508
                 OH, REALLY?

458
00:19:57,576 --> 00:19:59,210
        OH, REALLY?

459
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:00,511
    YOU GOTTA DO BETTER
        THAN THAT.

460
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,046
        YOU'RE GOING
    TO LOSE THE ARGUMENT.

461
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:03,581
STAY OUT OF THIS.

462
00:20:03,648 --> 00:20:05,916
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN IN THIS JOB,

463
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:07,085
    2 WEEKS?

464
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:08,519
                GO TO HELL!

465
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:10,388
                JUST GO TO HELL!

466
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:11,889
        WAY TO GO!

467
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:14,258
WHAT IF HE PROMISES
NOT TO DO IT AGAIN?

468
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:16,394
DO ME A FAVOR. TELL HER
YOU WON'T DO IT AGAIN.

469
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:19,397
    I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
    IN THE FIRST PLACE,

470
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:21,366
        WHICH IS WHAT
    I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN.

471
00:20:26,104 --> 00:20:28,539
                I AM NOT HAPPY
                ABOUT THIS!

472
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:31,859
        LADY, THIS IS JUSTICE
        DEPARTMENT POLICY.

473
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:33,361
                WELL,
                THEY'RE WRONG.

474
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:35,130
                THEY'RE WRONG,
                AND I'M RIGHT!

475
00:20:35,197 --> 00:20:36,631
    LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

476
00:20:36,698 --> 00:20:38,566
    HAVE YOU EVER BEEN WRONG
        ABOUT ANYTHING?

477
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:39,967
                    YES.

478
00:20:40,035 --> 00:20:41,302
                    ONCE.

479
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,070
THE SHOES, RIGHT?

480
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:45,406
THE SHOES
ARE TRAGIC.

481
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:54,249
                CREEP.

            REVOLTING, CREEP!

483
00:20:55,817 --> 00:20:57,318
I THOUGHT
HE WAS CUTE.

484
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:58,953
        NOT THAT ONE.
        THE OTHER ONE.

485
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:07,878
        LISTEN CAREFULLY,
        FLUFFY,

486
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:09,880
        'CAUSE I'M ONLY
        SAYING THIS ONCE.

487
00:21:09,948 --> 00:21:12,583
        TOMMY AND I ARE GOING
        DOWN TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE

488
00:21:12,651 --> 00:21:14,084
        FOR THANKSGIVING
        WITH DAD.

489
00:21:14,152 --> 00:21:15,085
        DO YOU REMEMBER DAD?

490
00:21:15,153 --> 00:21:17,321
        YEAH, HE USED
        TO LIVE HERE.

491
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:20,824
        WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK
        ON SUNDAY NIGHT, THOUGH.

492
00:21:20,892 --> 00:21:23,160
        PROMISE YOU WON'T FLUSH
        HIM DOWN THE TOILET?

493
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:24,662
    I CAN'T PROMISE
    ANYTHING.

494

498
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:36,073
SO WHAT'S UP?

499
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:38,509
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TODAY, MOM?

    YOU'RE GOING.

    I WOULDN'T BE HERE
    ANYWAY.

503
00:21:42,914 --> 00:21:45,349
DO YOU STILL LOVE
OUR DAD?

504
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,752
    NO, BUT I STILL
    LOVE YOU.

505
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:49,219
"AND YOUR DAD LOVES YOU.

506
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:50,788
THAT'S ALL
THAT REALLY MATTERS."

00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,702
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS
WHEN YOU GET BACK SUNDAY.

            YOU SHOULDN'T JUST
            WALK IN HERE

520
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,384
            LIKE YOU STILL
            LIVE HERE.

TO RING THE DOORBELL

522
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:23,120
IN MY OWN HOUSE?

523
00:22:23,188 --> 00:22:25,423
        THIS IS NOT YOUR HOUSE
        ANYMORE.

524
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:27,925
I MAY NOT LIVE HERE,
BUT IT'S STILL MY HOUSE.

        I-I'M CLEANING
        IN SOLITARY.

00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,560
    OF COURSE, YOU ALWAYS
    CLEAN IN SOLITARY.

530
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:04,562
        THERE'S NOTHING
        NEW IN THAT,

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,364
    BUT STILL, DRINKING,
    MUTTERING TO MYSELF,

            I DON'T LIKE THIS,
            KIRBY. REALLY.

536
00:23:39,664 --> 00:23:41,599
THE GUY'S HANGING
AROUND A BAR.

537
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,467
HE'S LOOKING TO BUY
STOLEN CREDIT CARDS.

538
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:45,803
COULD BE A MAJOR
CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY.

539
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:47,605
                I DON'T KNOW.

            OUT OF THE WATER.

542
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:53,310
WHO MADE YOU UNDERCOVER?

543
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:54,311
                    I DID.

THAT WAY.

THEY DON'T ALL
HAVE LIMITS.

            BE VALID.

THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE.

                THAN ME AND HER.

752
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:20,601
NO, NOT MY TYPE.

753
00:32:20,668 --> 00:32:23,103
I LIKE THEM
A LITTLE, UH...

754
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:24,605
I DON'T KNOW.

755
00:32:24,672 --> 00:32:26,106
KIND OF DIRTY
OR SOMETHING.

756
00:32:26,174 --> 00:32:28,609
YOU OUGHT
TO TAKE HER OUT.

757
00:32:28,676 --> 00:32:30,110
YOU OUGHT TO MARRY HER.

758
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:31,612
            I'M STILL MARRIED.

759
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,847
A GUY IN RENO WILL MARRY YOU
EVEN IF YOU'RE STILL MARRIED.

760
00:32:33,914 --> 00:32:34,848
I'LL ARRANGE
THE WHOLE THING.

761
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:36,850
        DO ME A FAVOR.
        DON'T ARRANGE ANYTHING.

762
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:38,352
         DON'T DO ANYTHING.

763
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:40,854
        JUST LAY LOW UNTIL
        WE GET THROUGH NEW YORK.

764
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:42,489
        STAY OUT OF TROUBLE.

765
00:32:43,758 --> 00:32:46,126
I'M WITH YOU.

766
00:32:46,194 --> 00:32:47,628
WHAT'S THIS?

767
00:32:47,695 --> 00:32:48,928
    OH.

768
00:33:03,194 --> 00:33:04,295
SURPRISE!

769
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:05,829
            SURPRISE!

770
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,667
                ROCCO BAMONTE!

771
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:12,369
        PETER BAKER.

772
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:15,172
            PETER BAKER?
            THAT'S FANTASTIC.

773
00:33:16,107 --> 00:33:17,541
                RICHIE PAOLUCCI.

774
00:33:17,608 --> 00:33:19,543
    NO, NO, NO.
    MICHAEL PETERSON.

775
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,045
                I WAS
                YOUR PALLBEARER.

776
00:33:21,112 --> 00:33:22,947
    I APPRECIATE IT,
    VINNIE.

777
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:25,215
VINNIE!

778
00:33:25,283 --> 00:33:26,716
        NICKY THE FISH!

779
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,718
        WHAT ARE YOU
        DOING HERE?

780
00:33:28,786 --> 00:33:30,720
                IT'S GREAT
                TO SEE YOU, VIN.

781
00:33:30,788 --> 00:33:31,822
    HEY!

782
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:33,824
            DINO!
        HOW ARE YOU, DINO?

783
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:35,326
                BOY, VINNIE,
                YOU LOOK GOOD.

784
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:36,726
    I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

785
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:48,923
        WHAT THE FRIG IS THIS?

786
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,557
                A POPOVER.

787
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:52,293
            THERE'S NOTHING
            IN IT.

788
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,829
        LAST WEEK I DROVE
        43 MILES TO A RESTAURANT

789
00:33:55,897 --> 00:33:58,332
        I HEARD HAD GOOD
        MARINARA SAUCE.

790
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,833
HOW WAS IT?

791
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:01,535
                    PLEASE.

792
00:34:01,602 --> 00:34:02,937
    THEY WAY I LOOK AT IT,

793
00:34:03,004 --> 00:34:04,305
    THIS IS WHERE YOU GO
        WHEN YOU DIE.

794
00:34:04,372 --> 00:34:06,307
EVERYTHING'S SO CLEAN.

795
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:07,607
            EVERYBODY'S SO NICE.

796
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:10,210
    GOOD WE'RE NOT BROKE,
    OR WE'D REALLY BE MISERABLE.

797
00:34:10,278 --> 00:34:11,578
                    I'M BROKE.

798
00:34:11,646 --> 00:34:13,680
    BUT YOU GET YOUR CHECK
        EVERY WEEK

799
00:34:13,748 --> 00:34:15,182
    FROM THE GOVERNMENT,
        RIGHT?

800
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:19,886
HOW LONG YOU THINK
YOU GET YOUR CHECK?

801
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:22,089
            FOREVER.

802
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:23,257
    YEAH?

803
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:24,891
HERE'S TO FOREVER.

804
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:30,431
    WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

805
00:34:30,498 --> 00:34:31,948
            READ THE FINE PRINT.

806
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:34,184
            THEY ONLY SEND YOU
            THE CHECK

807
00:34:34,251 --> 00:34:35,686
            TILL YOU TESTIFY.

808
00:34:35,753 --> 00:34:36,953
                THEN...

809
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:39,489
            THEY ACTUALLY EXPECT
            YOU TO GO TO WORK.

810
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:42,225
        BASTARDS.

811
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:43,360
            CREEPS.

812
00:34:44,595 --> 00:34:46,029
        WHAT THE HELL?

813
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:47,531
            WE SHOULD
        GO INTO BUSINESS.

814
00:34:47,598 --> 00:34:50,367
    THERE'S ENOUGH OF US HERE
    TO START A CRIME WAVE.

815
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:10,654
            HOLD IT.

816
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:21,064
            COME ON, COME ON.
            BRING IT IN.

817
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:22,699
            YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

818
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:32,709
                    HIJACKING.

819
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,584
            SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

820
00:35:40,652 --> 00:35:42,085
GOOD NIGHT, VINNIE.

821
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:43,587
    TAKE CARE, VIN.

822
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:45,589
                HAVE A GOOD ONE,
                VINNIE.

823
00:35:45,657 --> 00:35:47,591
            NOW, VIN, REMEMBER,
            NO SPEEDING!

824
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:48,759
            WATCH YOURSELF.

825
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:51,361
            OK, BOYS,
            BACK TO WORK.

826
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:06,142
        [SIREN]

827
00:36:11,282 --> 00:36:14,217
        WE ARE NOT ACCUSING YOU
        OF ANYTHING BUT SPEEDING

828
00:36:14,285 --> 00:36:16,219
        AT THE MOMENT,
        MR. WILKINSON,

829
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:18,054
        BUT I'D LIKE VERY MUCH

830
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:20,724
        TO KNOW ABOUT THE ITEMS
        IN YOUR TRUNK.

831
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:21,892
WHICH ITEMS?

832
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,895
        WELL, LET'S START WITH
        THE CASSETTE PLAYERS.

833
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:27,397
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT CASSETTE PLAYERS.

834
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:29,733
        THERE WERE 40 OF THEM
        IN YOUR TRUNK.

835
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:31,067
    OH.

836
00:36:31,135 --> 00:36:33,570
A GUY I KNOW WON THOSE
IN A CONTEST.

837
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:35,071
            THEY WERE PART
            OF A SHIPMENT

838
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:36,573
            THAT WAS HIJACKED
            4 DAYS AGO

839
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:38,141
            ON THE WAY
            TO RADIO SHACK.

840
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:39,643
OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE.

841
00:36:39,711 --> 00:36:41,144
            AND THE SWORDFISH?

842
00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:42,646
I KNOW THIS GUY.

843
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:45,649
HIS WHOLE LIFE
IS FISHING,

844
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:48,151
BUT HE CAUGHT
TOO MANY FISH,

845
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:49,887
SO HE ASKED ME,

846
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:52,990
WOULD I KEEP SOME FISH
IN MY FREEZER,

847
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:55,993
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY ROOM
IN MY FREEZER

848
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,495
ON ACCOUNT OF
ANOTHER GUY I KNOW

849
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:00,130
GIVING ME
A SIDE OF BEEF.

850
00:37:00,197 --> 00:37:03,600
SO HE PUT THE FISH
IN MY TRUNK

851
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:07,804
WHILE THE WEATHER'S COLD,
UNBEKNOWNST TO ME.

852
00:37:14,512 --> 00:37:15,846
            MR. WILKINSON...

853
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:20,450
            PUT THE BALL AWAY
            AND SIT DOWN!

854
00:37:29,493 --> 00:37:30,794
                THE BOOKS.

855
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:32,529
YOU GOT SOMETHING
AGAINST BOOKS?

856
00:37:32,597 --> 00:37:35,032
                I HAVE NOTHING
                AGAINST BOOKS.

857
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:36,466
                I'M CURIOUS

858
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:38,936
                ABOUT THE BOOKS
                IN YOUR TRUNK.

859
00:37:39,003 --> 00:37:42,039
YOU SEE, I WAS THINKING
OF WRITING MY STORY,

860
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:45,742
SO I BOUGHT THIS BOOK
ON HOW TO DO IT.

861
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,744
                WHY DO YOU NEED
                25 COPIES OF IT?

862
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:57,754
IN CASE I WANT TO READ IT
MORE THAN ONCE.

863
00:37:57,822 --> 00:38:01,257
        I'M SURE IT WILL COME
        AS NO SURPRISE TO YOU

864
00:38:01,325 --> 00:38:03,159
        TO LEARN THESE BOOKS
        WERE PART OF A SHIPMENT

865
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:04,561
        THAT WAS
        HIJACKED YESTERDAY

866
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:06,129
        ON THE WAY
        TO B. DALTON'S.

867
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:07,330
    NO!

868
00:38:07,398 --> 00:38:09,265
                YES!
                MR. WILKINSON--

869
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,602
HOW'S THE TURTLE,
MRS. STUBBS?

870
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:13,937
                FINE, THANK YOU.

871
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:15,672
DID YOUR KIDS
EVER FIGURE OUT

872
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,173
YOU SWITCHED TURTLES
ON THEM?

873
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:19,442
BECAUSE I KNOW IT WOULD BE
A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT

874
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,444
FOR THEM TO FIND OUT.

875
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:24,514
        DID YOU HAVE A WARRANT?

876
00:38:24,582 --> 00:38:26,549
BARNEY, YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS LADY DID?

877
00:38:26,618 --> 00:38:28,051
SHE WHACKED
A TURTLE--

878
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,553
        THIS MAN APPEARS
        TO HAVE BEEN

879
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:33,056
        IN AT LEAST
        3 MAJOR HIJACKINGS,

880
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:35,558
        JUST BASED ON WHAT
        WE FOUND IN HIS TRUNK.

881
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:39,062
    DID YOU HAVE A WARRANT
    TO SEARCH HIS TRUNK?

882
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,230
                        NO.

883
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:41,732
    SEE, SHE DIDN'T EVEN
    HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE.

884
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:43,734
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO SEARCH.

885
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:44,901
        PROBABLE CAUSE.

886
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:46,903
    JEFFERSON PUT THAT
    IN THE CONSTITUTION.

887
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:48,404
                    NOT FOR YOU.

888
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:50,907
    I'M EXACTLY THE GUY
    HE PUT IT IN FOR.

889
00:38:50,975 --> 00:38:52,408
MRS. STUBBS,
I ADMIRE YOUR ZEAL.

890
00:38:52,476 --> 00:38:53,576
            DON'T PATRONIZE ME.

891
00:38:53,645 --> 00:38:56,579
    I'M THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO
    OF JEFFERSON'S DREAMS.

892
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:57,748
THIS WAY.

893
00:38:57,815 --> 00:38:59,750
    PRESUMABLY, THE STATUTE
        OF LIMITATIONS

894
00:38:59,817 --> 00:39:01,752
    WILL NOT HAVE RUN OUT--

895
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:04,254
            I'VE BEEN THINKING
            OF ADVISING THIS MAN

896
00:39:04,321 --> 00:39:05,756
            TO GET INVOLVED
            WITH YOU,

897
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:07,257
            BUT NOW I'M AFRAID
            I CAN'T,

898
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:08,258
            BECAUSE
            YOU ARE DEFINITELY

899
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:09,760
            LOSING YOUR SENSE
            OF HUMOR.

900
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:11,261
YOU CAN'T
TOUCH HIM.

901
00:39:11,328 --> 00:39:12,763
        I CAN, TOO!

902
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,230
            IF YOU EVER HAD
            A SENSE OF HUMOR.

903
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:15,732
Hannah: WHEN YOU
FINISH TESTIFYING,

904
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,233
ALL BETS ARE OFF.

905
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:18,568
            EVERYBODY THINKS
            THEY HUMOROUS,

906
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:20,037
            BUT THEY'RE NOT.

907
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:22,472
YOU COMMIT SO MUCH
AS A MISDEMEANOR,

908
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,474
I'LL THROW
THE BOOK AT YOU.

909
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:26,476
        OK, HERE'S A TEST.

910
00:39:26,544 --> 00:39:28,912
        WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
        BETWEEN A LIGHT BULB

911
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,613
        AND A PREGNANT WOMAN?

912
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:33,817
    WHAT?

913
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:36,853
            YOU CAN UNSCREW
            A LIGHT BULB.

914
00:39:41,225 --> 00:39:44,728
            SEE? NO SENSE
            OF HUMOR WHATSOEVER.

915
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:02,011
CARE FOR SOMETHING
TO DRINK, MA'AM?

916
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,179
        NO, THANKS.

917
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:04,681
SOMETHING
TO DRINK, SIR?

918
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:06,850
    LET ME BORROW
    THAT PEN AGAIN.

919
00:40:09,086 --> 00:40:11,788
WHAT CAN I GET YOU TWO
TO DRINK TODAY?

920
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:13,523
                    GINGER ALE
                    FOR ME.

921
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:15,792
    2 DOUBLE SCOTCHES, PLEASE.

922
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,027
WE'RE ONLY ALLOWED
TO SELL YOU 2 DRINKS.

923
00:40:18,095 --> 00:40:21,030
2 DOUBLE SCOTCHES
WOULD BE 4 DRINKS.

924
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:22,198
            I SEE.

925
00:40:22,266 --> 00:40:24,200
    ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT THIS?

926
00:40:24,268 --> 00:40:26,202
    YOU SELL ME MY DOUBLE SCOTCH

927
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,304
    AND YOU SELL MY FRIEND
    HIS DOUBLE SCOTCH,

928
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:30,306
    BUT INSTEAD OF PUTTING HIS
        ON HIS TRAY,

929
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:33,309
    YOU PUT IT ON MINE,
    AND I'LL PAY FOR YOU BOTH.

930
00:40:33,377 --> 00:40:36,479
    YOU LOOK FANTASTIC
    IN RED AND BLUE...PAM.

931
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:38,548
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

932
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:40,049
THAT'LL BE $12.

933
00:40:40,117 --> 00:40:41,551
            OK, AND, UH...

934
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,052
            KEEP THE CHANGE,
            PLEASE.

935
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,555
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO ACCEPT TIPS.

936
00:40:45,623 --> 00:40:47,557
            NOT ALLOWED
            TO ACCEPT TIPS.

937
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:49,559
SO YOUR CHANGE
IS $8.00.

938
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:50,727
THANK YOU.

939
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:51,895
        THANK YOU.

940
00:40:51,962 --> 00:40:54,397
CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING, MA'AM?

941
00:40:54,465 --> 00:40:56,900
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

942
00:40:56,967 --> 00:40:58,067
        BYE.

943
00:40:58,135 --> 00:41:00,069
            YOU TIP
            A FLIGHT ATTENDANT?

944
00:41:00,137 --> 00:41:01,571
I TIP EVERYBODY.

945
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,072
THAT'S MY PHILOSOPHY.

946
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,340
SEE, ACTUALLY,

947
00:41:04,408 --> 00:41:06,075
IT'S NOT TIPPING
I BELIEVE IN.

948
00:41:06,143 --> 00:41:08,010
IT'S OVERTIPPING.

949
00:41:08,078 --> 00:41:10,513
I THINK THIS IS
THE KIND OF THING

950
00:41:10,581 --> 00:41:12,014
PEOPLE WOULD
LIKE TO KNOW.

951
00:41:12,082 --> 00:41:14,183
GIVE ME THAT PEN AGAIN.

952
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,724
    P.A.: AMERICAN AIRLINES

00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:36,372
            AFTER WHICH
            WE'LL GO BACK.

962
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,875
            DON'T LET ANYONE
            KNOW WHO YOU ARE

963
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:40,376
            OR THAT
            YOU'RE IN TOWN.

964
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:41,878
            YOU'LL TELEPHONE
            NO ONE.

965
00:41:41,946 --> 00:41:44,313
            IF ANYONE LOOKS LIKE

        I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!
        ARE YOU CRAZY?

971
00:41:51,455 --> 00:41:53,790
NOBODY KNOWS
I'M HERE BUT THEM.

972
00:41:53,858 --> 00:41:54,891

UNDO MY CUFFS SO I CAN
HUG MY OWN MOTHER.

978
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,664
                I CAN'T DO THAT,
                VINNIE.

979
00:42:34,732 --> 00:42:37,667
DON'T MAKE ME
LOOK LIKE A CRIMINAL

980
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:39,502
IN FRONT OF MY MOTHER.

981
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,837
    MAMA.

982
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:45,474
            MAMA.

983
00:42:49,547 --> 00:42:51,147
        OH, MAMA.

995
00:44:28,178 --> 00:44:32,548
¶ THESE LITTLE TOWN BLUES ¶

996
00:44:32,616 --> 00:44:35,652
¶ ARE MELTING AWAY ¶

997
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:36,919
        VINNIE, WE'RE LATE.

998
00:44:36,987 --> 00:44:38,788
        WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
        DOWNTOWN.

999
00:44:38,856 --> 00:44:41,257
YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

1000
00:44:41,324 --> 00:44:42,458
                    TRAGIC.

1001
00:44:42,526 --> 00:44:45,928
        BARNEY, TAKE A LOOK
        AT THE 2 OF US.

1002
00:44:45,996 --> 00:44:47,964
        TAKE A LOOK.

1003
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,135
    YOU SEE,
    WE DON'T MATCH.

1004
00:44:52,202 --> 00:44:53,736
    YOU DRESS LIKE THIS,

1005
00:44:53,804 --> 00:44:55,604
YOU ATTRACT
ATTENTION TO ME.

1006
00:44:55,673 --> 00:44:56,939
THAT'S DANGEROUS.

1007
00:44:57,007 --> 00:44:59,108
WAIT TILL
YOU SEE THIS.

1008
00:45:01,812 --> 00:45:04,914
        WOW. THE WORST.

1009
00:45:05,883 --> 00:45:07,249
                    IT'S A PAIR
                    OF SOCKS.

1010
00:45:07,317 --> 00:45:09,118
JUST TRY SOMETHING
DIFFERENT.

1011
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:11,453
    VINNIE, I'M NOT
    INTERESTED IN THIS.

1012
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:14,057
        OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT.
        WE KNOW THIS.

1013
00:45:14,124 --> 00:45:15,524
        IF YOU WERE INTERESTED,

1014
00:45:15,592 --> 00:45:17,093
        WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING
        THIS CONVERSATION.

1015
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:18,094
        THANK YOU, TOMMY.

1016
00:45:18,162 --> 00:45:20,196
        NO WONDER
        YOUR WIFE LEFT YOU.

1017
00:45:20,263 --> 00:45:23,032
            SHE DIDN'T LEAVE ME
            BECAUSE OF MY SOCKS.

1018
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,535
        THE WARDROBE IS A SYMBOL
        OF HOW YOU ARE.

1019
00:45:26,603 --> 00:45:28,805
        NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1020
00:45:28,872 --> 00:45:31,540
        BARNEY, LISTEN TO ME.

1021
00:45:31,608 --> 00:45:33,042
        IT'S VERY HARD

1022
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:35,377
        FOR A HUMAN BEING
        TO CHANGE.

1023
00:45:35,445 --> 00:45:38,147
        I KNOW THIS.
        I AM AN EXPERT ON THIS.

1024
00:45:38,215 --> 00:45:39,782
        SO, SOMETIMES...

1025
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:41,884
        IN ORDER FOR
        A HUMAN BEING TO CHANGE,

1026
00:45:41,952 --> 00:45:45,387
        YOU HAVE TO CHANGE
        FROM THE OUTSIDE IN.

1027
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,225
                        WOW!

1028
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:51,060
                    YOU LOOK

        IN THAT PICTURE. JEEZ.

            FROM ROOM SERVICE?

1039
00:46:13,334 --> 00:46:14,434
NOTHING.

1040
00:46:14,501 --> 00:46:16,269
                YOU GOT TO EAT
                SOMETHING.

1041
00:46:16,337 --> 00:46:19,105
WHAT I WANT
IS LINGUINI AT BRUNO'S.

1042
00:46:19,173 --> 00:46:21,607
A LITTLE LINGUINI,
A LITTLE SCUNGILLI.

00:46:21,675 --> 00:46:24,110
            I'LL GET YOU
            SOME ITALIAN FOOD.

1044
00:46:24,178 --> 00:46:26,612
            YOU THINK
            I LIKE HOTEL ROOMS?

1045
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,948
            I'D LIKE TO ORDER
            ROOM SERVICE FOR 2.

1046
00:46:29,016 --> 00:46:30,116
                ROOM 606.

1047
00:46:30,184 --> 00:46:32,485
            DO YOU HAVE
            ANY ITALIAN FOOD?

1048
00:46:32,552 --> 00:46:34,587
        WHAT DOES THAT ITALIAN
        DRESSING COME ON, SALAD?

1049
00:46:34,654 --> 00:46:37,123
        OK, I'LL TAKE ONE
        OF THOSE.

1050
00:46:37,191 --> 00:46:38,891
        AND WHAT KIND OF PASTA
        DO YOU HAVE?

1051
00:46:38,959 --> 00:46:40,493
        MACARONI AND CHEESE.

1052
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,029
        OK, I'LL TAKE
        ONE OF THOSE.

1053
00:46:43,097 --> 00:46:45,164
        WHAT'S THIS
        CHICKEN VOLAVENT?

1054
00:46:45,232 --> 00:46:46,665
        CAN YOU MAKE THAT

1055
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:48,667
        WITHOUT
        THE SILKY CREAM SAUCE?

1056
00:46:48,735 --> 00:46:52,838
        I JUST WANT IT
        IN A FLAKY PASTRY.

1057
00:46:52,906 --> 00:46:54,374
        OK, FINE. THEN--

1058
00:46:55,642 --> 00:46:56,709
            WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

1059
00:46:56,776 --> 00:46:58,077
I'M WRINKLING
UP YOUR JACKET

1060
00:46:58,145 --> 00:46:59,912
LIKE YOU'RE
WRINKLING YOUR PANTS.

1061
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,981
        WHAT ARE YOU
        TALKING ABOUT? WHY?!

1062
00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:03,716
YOU BOUGHT
A $1,200 SUIT.

1063
00:47:03,783 --> 00:47:07,586
YOU HANG UP THE JACKET,
BUT LAY AROUND IN YOUR PANTS.

1064
00:47:07,654 --> 00:47:08,888
YOU'RE WRINKLING THE PANTS.

1065
00:47:08,955 --> 00:47:10,423
GIVE ME YOUR PANTS.

1066
00:47:10,491 --> 00:47:11,991
I'LL HANG THEM UP.

1067
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:13,726
WHAT HAPPENS--
GIVE ME YOUR PANTS--

1068
00:47:13,793 --> 00:47:15,561
THE PANTS GO
TO THE DRY CLEANERS

1069
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:16,929
MORE THAN THE JACKET,

1070
00:47:16,997 --> 00:47:19,932
AND YOU END UP WITH A SUIT
THAT DOESN'T MATCH.

1071
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,934
I'LL TAKE THIS DOWN
TO THAT PRESSING MACHINE.

1072
00:47:22,002 --> 00:47:23,436
SINCE WE'RE STAYING IN,

1073
00:47:23,504 --> 00:47:25,371
ORDER ME
THE MACARONI AND CHEESE,

1074
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,407
AND GET ONE OF THOSE
LITTLE BOTTLES OF WINE

1075
00:47:27,474 --> 00:47:29,808
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO DRINK TOO MUCH.

1076
00:47:29,876 --> 00:47:32,345
WILL I NEED CHANGE?
NO. NO.

1077
00:47:32,413 --> 00:47:33,612
THEY'LL HAVE CHANGE
DOWN THERE.

1078
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,516
I'LL BE BACK
IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES, OK?

1079
00:47:44,824 --> 00:47:45,891
                AARRGH!

1080
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:50,629
                    VINNIE!

1081
00:47:50,697 --> 00:47:52,098
                     VINNIE!

1082
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:54,733
                VINNIE!

1083
00:47:55,986 --> 00:47:57,587
    SO WE OPEN UP THE TRUCK,

1084
00:47:57,654 --> 00:47:59,922
    AND WHAT IS THERE
    BUT 6,000 WATCHES?

1085
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:01,757
        I THINK,
    GREAT, 6,000 WATCHES.

1086
00:48:01,825 --> 00:48:03,392
    HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

1087
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,760
    BUT WHAT I DON'T REALIZE

1088
00:48:04,828 --> 00:48:06,762
    IS THAT EACH WATCH
    IS WORTH 10 GRAND.

1089
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,264
        NOW IF YOU DO
    YOUR MULTIPLICATION...

1090
00:48:08,332 --> 00:48:10,099
                MAY I HELP YOU,
                SIR?

1091
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:11,734
        I'M MEETING SOMEBODY.

1092
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:15,904
                VINNIE!

1093
00:48:15,972 --> 00:48:18,040
            $60 MILLION
            WOULD BUY THE BAR.

1094
00:48:18,108 --> 00:48:20,075
    SO EDDIE,
    MAKE ME THE DRINK

1095
00:48:20,144 --> 00:48:22,578
    YOU MADE THE NIGHT
    MARY WAS SHOT.

1096
00:48:22,646 --> 00:48:24,614
    I THINK IT WAS
    A BLOODY MARY.

1097
00:48:24,681 --> 00:48:26,882
                PSST! VINNIE.

1098
00:48:28,152 --> 00:48:29,318
                WHO'S THAT?

00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,521
        COME HERE.

00:48:33,657 --> 00:48:34,757
        IT'S LOUIE!

1101
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:37,092
        LOUIE VINCHENZI
        FROM SAN FRANCISCO.

1102
00:48:37,161 --> 00:48:39,295
        WHAT ARE YOU
        DOING HERE?

1103
00:48:42,732 --> 00:48:45,268
        THIS MAN'S SO FAST,
        HE DOESN'T WEAR PANTS.

1104
00:48:45,335 --> 00:48:47,936
        IT SLOWS HIM DOWN.
        HOW WAS SHE?

1105
00:48:48,004 --> 00:48:49,438

1108
00:48:52,876 --> 00:48:54,943
YOU WANNA HAVE A GOOD TIME

ANNETTE, GIVE ME
THAT GRAY SUIT I GAVE YOU.

00:48:58,882 --> 00:49:01,116
        I'LL BE PAYING IT OFF
        THE REST OF MY LIFE.

1112
00:49:01,185 --> 00:49:02,652
            CHAMPAGNE
            FOR EVERYBODY?

1113
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,153
            WHAT
            A FANTASTIC GUY.

1114
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:06,121
I COULD'VE BOUGHT A VCR.
COULD'VE BOUGHT A NEW CAR!

1115
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,957
            DON'T GET HIM MAD.

1116
00:49:09,025 --> 00:49:11,327
    I CAN'T BELIEVE
    YOU DID THIS TO ME.

1117
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:12,861
    ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.
    RIGHT NOW.

1118
00:49:12,929 --> 00:49:14,363
        RELAX.
        THIS IS MY TERRITORY.

1119
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:15,864
BACK TO THE MOTEL.

1120
00:49:15,932 --> 00:49:18,367
            I WANT TO SHOW YOU
            SOMETHING.

1121
00:49:18,435 --> 00:49:19,868
            YOU SEE THOSE GUYS?

1122
00:49:19,936 --> 00:49:21,637
YES, I DO.

1123
00:49:21,705 --> 00:49:24,139
            IF THEY FIND OUT
            YOU'RE FBI,

1124
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:26,141
            WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

1125
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,643
            SO, WHAT'LL IT BE,

1126
00:49:27,711 --> 00:49:29,645
            THE MOTEL AND TV

1127
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:31,714
            OR DRINKING
            AND GIRLS?

1128
00:49:41,225 --> 00:49:43,359
            KNOW WHAT
            I NOTICED ABOUT YOU?

1129
00:49:43,427 --> 00:49:44,360
    WHAT?

1130
00:49:44,428 --> 00:49:46,329
            YOU NEVER LOOK THEM
            IN THE EYE.

1131
00:49:46,397 --> 00:49:47,497
    WHO?

1132
00:49:47,564 --> 00:49:49,665
        GIRLS. YOU'RE
        A GOOD-LOOKING GUY.

1133
00:49:49,733 --> 00:49:52,502
        YOU'RE A BETTER-LOOKING
        GUY THAN I AM,

1134
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:55,171
        BUT I ALWAYS LOOK THEM
        IN THE EYE.

1135
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:58,174
        THEREFORE, I'LL ALWAYS
        GET LAID MORE THAN YOU,

1136
00:49:58,242 --> 00:50:00,843
        WHICH IS FUNDAMENTALLY
        UNJUST, AM I RIGHT?

1137
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:02,345
        YOU'RE INTO JUSTICE.

1138
00:50:02,413 --> 00:50:04,680
        THIS ARGUMENT
        SHOULD APPEAL TO YOU.

1139
00:50:04,748 --> 00:50:05,848
            COME HERE.

1140
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:07,016
    WHAT?

1141
00:50:07,084 --> 00:50:08,651
            LEAVE YOUR CELERY.

1142

        HIYA, GIRLS.

00:50:19,096 --> 00:50:20,229
                        MARIE.

1148
00:50:20,297 --> 00:50:22,365
    I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
    MY BROTHER-IN-LAW BARNEY.

    DON'T ASK ME
    TO EXPLAIN IT.

00:50:28,105 --> 00:50:29,872
                BARNEY. WHAT
                A GREAT NAME.

1153
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,374
    THEY ALWAYS SAY THAT,
    EVEN IF YOUR NAME IS MORTY.

1154
00:50:31,442 --> 00:50:33,709
    NOW LOOK HER
    RIGHT IN THE EYE.

            IN THE BUREAU.

1190
00:54:08,675 --> 00:54:10,576
    REALLY?

1191
00:54:11,678 --> 00:54:12,911
                YEP.

1192
00:54:14,548 --> 00:54:16,716
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

1193
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,621
            YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

1194
00:54:21,688 --> 00:54:24,123
WE'RE IN EACH
OTHER'S DEBT FOREVER.

1195
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:26,325
THAT'S SO GREAT.

1196
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,064
                    GOOD NIGHT,
                    VINNIE.

1197
00:54:32,132 --> 00:54:33,999
GOOD NIGHT, BARNEY.

1198
00:54:36,136 --> 00:54:38,554
    AND WHAT HAPPENED THEN,
    MR. ANTONELLI?

1199
00:54:38,622 --> 00:54:40,822
                MR. CAPELLI
                LEFT THE ROOM.

1200
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:47,563
DID MR. GAZZO SAY ANYTHING
AT THIS POINT?

1201
00:54:47,631 --> 00:54:50,366
                MR. GAZZO SAID,
                "KILL THE FART."

1202
00:54:50,433 --> 00:54:52,067
                I APOLOGIZE,
                YOUR HONOR,

1203
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:53,902
                BUT THAT'S
                WHAT HE SAID.

1204
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:56,071
TO WHOM WAS HE SPEAKING?

1205
00:54:56,139 --> 00:54:58,073
            SONNY, FRANKIE,
            RICHIE, AL--

1206
00:54:58,141 --> 00:54:59,975
            THE GUYS
            WHO WERE THERE.

1207
00:55:00,043 --> 00:55:02,478
            AND THEN THEY HAD
            A LITTLE EGGPLANT

1208
00:55:02,546 --> 00:55:03,979
            BENNY'S MOTHER MADE.

1209
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:05,514
            SHE PUTS CAPERS IN,

1210
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:07,349
            WHICH I THINK
            IS A MISTAKE.

1211
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:09,918
            THEN THEY KILLED
            NICKY CAPELLI.

1212
00:55:09,986 --> 00:55:12,521
            ONE BEHIND THE EAR
            WITH A .22.

1213
00:55:12,589 --> 00:55:14,323
            RICHIE LOVED
            TO USE .22s.

1214
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:15,857
            'CAUSE THE BULLETS
            ARE SMALL

1215
00:55:15,925 --> 00:55:17,226
            AND DON'T COME OUT
            THE OTHER END

1216
00:55:17,294 --> 00:55:19,528
            LIKE A .45.

1217
00:55:19,596 --> 00:55:22,198
            A .45 WILL BLOW
            A BARN DOOR

1218
00:55:22,265 --> 00:55:23,532
            OUT THE BACK
            OF YOUR HEAD.

1219
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,033
            LOTS OF DRY-CLEANING
            INVOLVED.

1220
00:55:25,101 --> 00:55:27,536
            A .22 WILL JUST
            RATTLE AROUND

1221
00:55:27,604 --> 00:55:29,538
            LIKE Pac-Man
            UNTIL YOU DIE.

1222
00:55:29,606 --> 00:55:31,373
THANK YOU,
MR. ANTONELLI.

1223
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:33,475
                YOU'RE WELCOME.

1224
00:55:33,543 --> 00:55:35,043
        YOUR WITNESS.

1225
00:55:35,111 --> 00:55:36,212
MR. ANTONELLI,

1226
00:55:36,279 --> 00:55:38,046
WHERE EXACTLY
DO YOU LIVE?

1227
00:55:38,114 --> 00:55:39,215
                        NOWHERE.

1228
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:40,382
OBJECTION.

1229
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,384
MR. LEVINE KNOWS
PERFECTLY WELL

1230
00:55:42,452 --> 00:55:45,053
THE WITNESS IS UNABLE
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

1231
00:55:45,121 --> 00:55:46,555
        I WITHDRAW
        THE QUESTION.

1232
00:55:46,623 --> 00:55:48,056
    AREN'T YOU CURRENTLY

1233
00:55:48,124 --> 00:55:50,392
    IN THE FEDERAL WITNESS
    PROTECTION PROGRAM?

1234
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,560
                        YES.

1235
00:55:51,628 --> 00:55:53,562
YOU'RE LIVING
SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA

1236
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,364
UNDER THE PROTECTION
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

1237
00:55:55,432 --> 00:55:58,234
YOU AGREED TO TESTIFY
AGAINST MR. GAZZO.

1238
00:55:58,301 --> 00:56:00,102
AND IN EXCHANGE
FOR THIS TESTIMONY,

1239
00:56:00,169 --> 00:56:01,570
YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN IMMUNITY,

1240
00:56:01,638 --> 00:56:03,905
A NICE HOUSE,
AND A WEEKLY PAYCHECK.

1241
00:56:03,973 --> 00:56:05,107
THAT CORRECT?

1242
00:56:05,174 --> 00:56:08,444
        THAT'S NOT ALL I GET.

1243
00:56:08,511 --> 00:56:10,779
PERHAPS YOU COULD
ENLIGHTEN THE JURY

1244
00:56:10,847 --> 00:56:12,080
AS TO WHAT ELSE

1245
00:56:12,148 --> 00:56:13,582
THE GOVERNMENT'S
GIVING YOU

1246
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:14,916
IN EXCHANGE
FOR THIS TESTIMONY.

1247
00:56:14,984 --> 00:56:16,218
                    SURE.

1248
00:56:18,187 --> 00:56:21,123
            I GET TO NEVER SEE
            MY PARENTS AGAIN

1249
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:22,924
            OR MY LOVED ONES.

1250
00:56:22,992 --> 00:56:26,395
            I GET TO LIVE
            IN A PLACE...

1251
00:56:26,463 --> 00:56:28,897
            IT'S OK.
            DON'T GET ME WRONG.

1252
00:56:28,965 --> 00:56:30,532
             THE AIR IS CLEAN.

1253
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,033
            THE PEOPLE ARE NICE.

1254
00:56:32,101 --> 00:56:34,870
            BUT
            FOR A GUY LIKE ME,

1255
00:56:34,937 --> 00:56:37,373
            WHO WAS RAISED
            ON THE SIDEWALKS

1256
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,608
            OF A CITY
            THAT NEVER SLEEPS,

1257
00:56:39,676 --> 00:56:41,477
            IT'S A LIVING HELL.

1258
00:56:41,544 --> 00:56:42,978
            THERE WERE TIMES

1259
00:56:43,045 --> 00:56:44,880
            WHEN I THOUGHT
            OF GIVING IT UP,

1260
00:56:44,947 --> 00:56:47,283
            PARTICULARLY WHEN
            MY WIFE LEFT ME.

1261
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:49,785
            THEY GAVE US
            A NICE HOUSE

1262
00:56:49,852 --> 00:56:51,287
            WITH FLOWERS
            IN FRONT.

1263
00:56:51,354 --> 00:56:52,788
            IT MADE HER SICK.

1264
00:56:52,855 --> 00:56:55,791
            BUT I MADE A DEAL
            WITH THE GOVERNMENT,

1265
00:56:55,858 --> 00:56:57,493
            SO I'M HERE TO TELL
            THE TRUTH.

1266
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,495
        IF YOU THINK I'M SAYING
        WHAT I'M SAYING

1267
00:56:59,562 --> 00:57:02,498
        ABOUT MR. GAZZO
        KILLING NICKY CAPELLI

1268
00:57:02,565 --> 00:57:04,500
            ONLY BECAUSE
            OF THE DEAL,

1269
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:06,302
            YOU GOT A POINT,

1270
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:08,470
            BUT IT'S STILL
            THE TRUTH.

1271
00:57:18,515 --> 00:57:20,816
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A LIGHT BULB

1272
00:57:20,884 --> 00:57:22,317
AND A PREGNANT WOMAN?

1273
00:57:22,385 --> 00:57:23,819
                I DON'T KNOW.

1274
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:26,655
YOU CAN UNSCREW
A LIGHT BULB.

1275
00:57:26,723 --> 00:57:28,824
        MICHELLE, A DRINK HERE
        FOR MY FRIEND.

1276
00:57:28,892 --> 00:57:31,159
OH, I COULDN'T POSSIBLY.

1277
00:57:31,227 --> 00:57:32,661
            OH, COME ON,
            HAVE A BRANDY.

1278
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:34,329
            MONKS MAKE IT.

1279
00:57:34,397 --> 00:57:37,332
            VINNIE, WE'LL HAVE
            TO WORK SO HARD

1280
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,502
            NEXT TIME
            WE COME TO NEW YORK

1281
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:42,004
            SO IT WON'T BE
            A LETDOWN

1282
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:43,338
            AFTER THIS TRIP.

1283
00:57:43,406 --> 00:57:45,173
            WHAT A FABULOUS TIME
            I HAD.

1284
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:47,175
ALTHOUGH
I GOT TO ADMIT,

1285
00:57:47,243 --> 00:57:50,178
IT WILL BE GOOD
TO GET BACK HOME.

1286
00:57:50,246 --> 00:57:52,347
BARNEY,
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

1287
00:57:52,415 --> 00:57:54,850
IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE

1288
00:57:54,918 --> 00:57:56,986
FOR YOU TO HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT D.A.

1289
00:57:57,053 --> 00:57:59,588
                GET OFF MY BACK
                ABOUT THE D.A.

1290
00:57:59,656 --> 00:58:01,423
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT ROMANCE.

1291
00:58:01,491 --> 00:58:02,925
 I'M JUST TALKING
 IN GENERAL.

1292
00:58:02,993 --> 00:58:05,093
WHY MAKE WAR
WITH THE D.A.?

1293
00:58:05,161 --> 00:58:07,095
YOU GOTTA BE
OUT OF YOUR MIND,

1294
00:58:07,163 --> 00:58:08,864
ESPECIALLY
IN YOUR LINE OF WORK.

1295
00:58:08,932 --> 00:58:10,365
SO WHEN YOU GET BACK

1296
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:12,367
TRY AND MAKE PEACE
WITH HER,

1297
00:58:12,435 --> 00:58:14,603
A LITTLE GESTURE
TO SHOW YOU'RE FRIENDLY.

1298
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:16,104
WHY MAKE WAR?

1299
00:58:16,172 --> 00:58:19,608
I MEAN, THAT'S
MY PHILOSOPHY ANYWAY.

1300
00:58:19,676 --> 00:58:22,244
THAT'S MY PHILOSOPHY.

1301
00:58:30,353 --> 00:58:31,787
            HI, MR. WILKINSON.

1302
00:58:31,855 --> 00:58:33,288
HI, MR. WILKINSON.

1303
00:58:33,356 --> 00:58:35,290
                HI, KIDS.
                HOW YA DOING?

1304
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:36,458
HI, TOD.

1305
00:58:36,526 --> 00:58:37,960
                HI, DEBBIE.
                HI, BRODIE.

1306
00:58:38,028 --> 00:58:40,829
                WHAT A DAY
                FOR A MOW, HUH?

1307
00:58:40,897 --> 00:58:41,830
        HEY, TIGER.

1308
00:58:41,898 --> 00:58:43,632
                WHERE'D YOU GET
                THAT JACKET?

1309
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,634
                YOU LOOK SHARP.

1310
00:58:45,702 --> 00:58:47,469
    HEY, BABY.

1311
00:58:49,205 --> 00:58:51,006
                    WAY TO GO,
                    COOPERSMITH.

1312
00:58:52,709 --> 00:58:53,809
        COOPERSMITH.

1313
00:58:53,877 --> 00:58:55,310
GOOD MORNING, SIR.

1314
00:58:55,378 --> 00:58:59,214
YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE HELP YOURSELF.

1315
00:59:12,729 --> 00:59:14,697
            WHO GAVE ME THIS?

1316
00:59:31,081 --> 00:59:33,348
                HI, KIDS.
                MY NAME IS TOD.

1317
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:34,950
                I'M A FRIEND
                OF YOUR MOM'S

1318
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:36,685
                FROM THE OFFICE.

1319
00:59:36,753 --> 00:59:37,853
        HI, I'M JAMIE.

1320
00:59:37,921 --> 00:59:38,854
I'M TOMMY.

1321
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:40,689
                    WHAT ARE YOU
                    DOING HERE?

1322
00:59:40,757 --> 00:59:43,191
        WE HAVE TO LEAVE
        RIGHT AWAY.

1323
00:59:43,259 --> 00:59:45,193
        OTHERWISE WE'RE GONNA
        MISS BATTING PRACTICE.

1324
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:46,194
LET'S GO.

1325
00:59:46,262 --> 00:59:47,696
    HEY, WE CAN'T GO.

1326
00:59:47,764 --> 00:59:49,231
    WE CAN'T GO.

1327
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:50,365
WHY NOT?

1362

        DO WE WANT, 2 EACH?

1366

1763
01:21:58,527 --> 01:21:59,961
THAT IT'S
SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROBLEM?

1764
01:22:00,028 --> 01:22:01,462
YOU STEAL
A LITTLE SWORDFISH,

1765
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:02,964
AND HANNAH
SHOULD LIGHTEN UP?

1766
01:22:03,031 --> 01:22:05,967
YOU PRETEND TO RAISE MONEY
FOR THE LITTLE LEAGUE,

1767
01:22:06,034 --> 01:22:07,969
AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY
SHOULD LIGHTEN UP?

1768
01:22:08,036 --> 01:22:09,470
HANNAH TURNS
AGAINST ME,

1769
01:22:09,538 --> 01:22:10,972
 AND <i>I</i> SHOULD
 LIGHTEN UP?

1770
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:12,974
            BARNEY,
            I'VE UPSET YOU.

1771
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:14,308
            I'M SORRY.

1772
01:22:14,376 --> 01:22:15,810
WHAT KIND OF JAIL
IS THIS?

1773
01:22:15,878 --> 01:22:17,478
        OH, I DON'T LIKE
        TO USE THIS BATHROOM,

1774
01:22:17,546 --> 01:22:19,981
        SO THEY LET ME USE
        THE OFFICE BATHROOM.

1775
01:22:20,048 --> 01:22:21,482
ISN'T THERE
A GUARD?

1776
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:22,984
        EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
        VINNIE?

1777
01:22:23,051 --> 01:22:25,486
    OH, JIMMY, YEAH.
    NO PROBLEM. THANKS.

1778
01:22:25,554 --> 01:22:28,155
    COME ON IN.
    COME ON IN.

1779
01:22:29,424 --> 01:22:30,691
SIT DOWN.

1780
01:22:34,863 --> 01:22:36,296
YOU HAVE A PILLOW

1781
01:22:36,364 --> 01:22:38,432
WITH YOUR NAME
EMBROIDERED ON IT?

1782
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,001
            YEAH, CRYSTAL
            MADE THAT FOR ME.

1783
01:22:40,068 --> 01:22:41,602
            IT'S NICE, ISN'T IT?

1784
01:22:48,076 --> 01:22:49,243
                HEY...

1785
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:51,746
        AT LEAST YOU NEVER
        GOT INVOLVED WITH HER.

1786
01:22:51,813 --> 01:22:54,248
        I CAN'T BELIEVE
        I EVEN SUGGESTED IT!

1787
01:22:54,315 --> 01:22:55,750
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND,
VINNIE?

1788
01:22:55,817 --> 01:22:57,251
I'M IN LOVE WITH HANNAH.

1789
01:22:57,318 --> 01:23:00,354
AND NOW SHE HATES ME,
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

1790
01:23:00,422 --> 01:23:01,856
I'M SO PISSED AT YOU!

1791
01:23:01,924 --> 01:23:03,758
I'M REALLY PISSED, OK?

1792
01:23:03,825 --> 01:23:04,892
                        OK.

1793
01:23:06,795 --> 01:23:08,729
            WHY IS IT MY FAULT?

1794
01:23:08,797 --> 01:23:11,231
BECAUSE YOU ARE A BLIGHT
ON THIS COMMUNITY,

1795
01:23:11,299 --> 01:23:14,902
AND I PUT YOU HERE,
SO SHE BLAMES ME.

1796
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:19,907
            BARNEY, I AM SORRY.

1797
01:23:19,975 --> 01:23:20,942
YEAH, RIGHT.

1798
01:23:21,009 --> 01:23:23,444
            I AM. REALLY, I AM.
            I OWE YOU.

1799
01:23:23,511 --> 01:23:24,946
            YOU SAVED MY LIFE

1800
01:23:25,013 --> 01:23:26,881
            THAT NIGHT
            IN NEW YORK.

1801
01:23:26,949 --> 01:23:28,883
            I COULD NEVER SHOOT
            AT ANYONE.

1802
01:23:28,951 --> 01:23:30,885
            I NEVER TOUCHED
            A GUN IN MY LIFE.

1803
01:23:30,953 --> 01:23:33,020
        IT DOOMED ME FOREVER
        TO MIDDLE MANAGEMENT,

1804
01:23:33,088 --> 01:23:35,923
        AND THAT'S THE TRUTH.

1805
01:23:35,991 --> 01:23:38,926
        I SHOULD DO SOMETHING.
        WHAT COULD I DO?

1806
01:23:38,994 --> 01:23:40,427
VINNIE,
DON'T DO ANYTHING.

1807
01:23:40,495 --> 01:23:42,697
PLEASE,
STOP DOING THINGS.

1808
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:46,500
                I HAVE TO MAKE
                A PHONE CALL.

1809
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:47,635
AW, VINNIE,
NOW WHAT?

1810
01:23:47,703 --> 01:23:49,904
            I AM ENTITLED TO
            MAKE A PHONE CALL,

1811
01:23:49,972 --> 01:23:51,138
            AM I NOT?

1812
01:23:51,206 --> 01:23:52,539
            OH, JAILER.

1813
01:23:53,942 --> 01:23:56,376
            SHOULD I USE
            THE OFFICE LINE

1814
01:23:56,444 --> 01:23:57,878
            OR THE ONE
            IN THE COFFEE ROOM.

1815
01:23:57,946 --> 01:23:59,447
OUR POSITION,
YOUR HONOR,

1816
01:23:59,514 --> 01:24:00,948
IS THAT
WE BE PERMITTED

1817
01:24:01,015 --> 01:24:03,784
TO HOLD MR. ANTONELLI
WITHOUT BAIL.

1818
01:24:03,852 --> 01:24:06,286
EVERY DAY
HE IS ON THE STREETS,

1819
01:24:06,354 --> 01:24:07,788
 HE COMMITS A CRIME.

1820
01:24:07,856 --> 01:24:10,290
AND WHILE
THAT MAY BE ALL RIGHT

1821
01:24:10,358 --> 01:24:11,792
IN PLACES LIKE NEW YORK

1822
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,794
WHERE PEOPLE
ARE USED TO IT,

1823
01:24:13,862 --> 01:24:16,296
HERE IN FRYBURG,
EVERY CITIZEN IS A VICTIM.

1824
01:24:16,364 --> 01:24:17,297
            HEAR, HEAR!

1825
01:24:17,365 --> 01:24:18,298
                THAT'S RIGHT.

1826
01:24:18,366 --> 01:24:21,034
        [APPLAUSE]

1827
01:24:21,102 --> 01:24:22,470
            MR. COOPERSMITH.

1828
01:24:22,537 --> 01:24:23,771
YOUR HONOR,

1829
01:24:23,839 --> 01:24:25,673
SPEAKING FOR THE FEDERAL
BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION,

1830
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:28,108
OUR POSITION
IS THAT MR. ANTONELLI

1831
01:24:28,176 --> 01:24:29,944
MUST NOT SPEND
ANOTHER NIGHT IN JAIL.

1832
01:24:30,011 --> 01:24:31,612
HIS LIFE IS IN DANGER.

1833
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,914
HE MUST BE PROTECTED
SO THAT HE CAN TESTIFY

1834
01:24:33,982 --> 01:24:35,916
AND THEREFORE,
WE ASK THAT YOU GRANT BAIL

1835
01:24:35,984 --> 01:24:37,952
                AND RELEASE HIM
                IN OUR CUSTODY.

1836
01:24:38,019 --> 01:24:38,953
YOUR HONOR,

1837
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:41,689
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT THE FBI DOES.

1838
01:24:41,756 --> 01:24:44,257
IT PRETENDS THIS MAN
IS IN DANGER

1839
01:24:44,325 --> 01:24:46,760
WHEN NO ONE CARES
ABOUT HIM ONE BIT.

1840
01:24:46,828 --> 01:24:48,261
THERE'S
ALL THIS MELODRAMA,

1841
01:24:48,329 --> 01:24:51,765
AS IF CARTOON HIT MEN
IN WHITE-ON-WHITE TIES

1842
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:55,435
ARE GOING TO WALK IN
AND TRY TO KILL HIM.

1843
01:24:55,504 --> 01:24:57,437
OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS
PREPOSTEROUS SCENARIO,

1844
01:24:57,506 --> 01:24:59,439
THE SORT OF
PARANOID FANTASY THAT--

1845
01:24:59,508 --> 01:25:00,975
                    DUCK!

1846
01:25:01,042 --> 01:25:02,843
                     DUCK!

1847
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,279
                HANNAH!

1848
01:25:06,347 --> 01:25:08,348
            GET DOWN, GET DOWN!

1849
01:25:10,919 --> 01:25:12,386
YOU OK?

1850
01:25:14,422 --> 01:25:16,323
        MOVE! COVER THE STAND!

1851
01:25:18,593 --> 01:25:21,629
I GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

1852
01:25:24,232 --> 01:25:25,432
                FOLLOW ME.

1853
01:25:31,339 --> 01:25:32,773
GET GOING,
COOPERSMITH!

1854
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:35,475
        VINNIE!
    AH, WHERE IS HE? VINNIE!

1855
01:25:35,544 --> 01:25:36,977
            IT'S ALL RIGHT,
            EVERYBODY!

1856
01:25:37,045 --> 01:25:38,311
            THEY'RE GONE!
            IT'S ALL RIGHT!

1857
01:25:38,379 --> 01:25:39,830
    USE MY CAR.

1858
01:25:39,898 --> 01:25:40,781
                    GREAT.

1859
01:25:40,849 --> 01:25:42,282
    OH, TAKE MY KEYS.

1860
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:43,283
                    THANKS.

1861
01:25:43,351 --> 01:25:44,784
    TAKE MY GUN.

1862
01:25:44,852 --> 01:25:46,186
                    WOW.

1863
01:25:46,254 --> 01:25:47,687
            YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

1864
01:25:47,755 --> 01:25:49,189
            I'M IN YOUR DEBT
            FOREVER.

1865
01:25:49,257 --> 01:25:50,824
            THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

1866
01:26:01,302 --> 01:26:02,469
    TAKE ME!

1867
01:26:03,638 --> 01:26:04,704
                GET IN.

1868
01:26:07,708 --> 01:26:10,110
            JUST PRETEND
            I'M YOUR HOSTAGE.

1869
01:26:33,968 --> 01:26:35,402
            I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

1870
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:38,071
            YOU'RE ACTUALLY
            BUILDING THIS.

1871
01:26:39,374 --> 01:26:41,908
        YO, VINNIE!
        YO, LOOK AT THIS!

1872
01:26:41,976 --> 01:26:44,712
            HEY, DINO,
            NICKY, BENNY!

1873
01:26:44,779 --> 01:26:47,748
            LOOKING GOOD!
            LOOKING GOOD!

1874
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:59,042
            [SIRENS]

1875
01:27:03,748 --> 01:27:06,183
    OH, MOM!
    GUESS WHAT HE BUILT.

1876
01:27:06,251 --> 01:27:08,686
            I KNOW.
            OK, HOLD ON A SEC.

1877
01:27:08,753 --> 01:27:10,187
IT'S SO AWESOME.

1878
01:27:10,255 --> 01:27:12,189
            HANNAH, HANNAH!
            ISN'T HE WONDERFUL?

1879
01:27:12,257 --> 01:27:13,691
WHY DIDN'T
YOU SAY ANYTHING

1880
01:27:13,758 --> 01:27:16,193
ABOUT THIS BALL PARK
WHEN I ARRESTED YOU?

1881
01:27:16,261 --> 01:27:18,195
                WHAT, AND RUIN
                THE SURPRISE?

1882
01:27:18,263 --> 01:27:20,698
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS BALL PARK

1883
01:27:20,765 --> 01:27:22,933
BECAUSE THERE
WAS NOTHING TO SAY.

1884
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,337
YOU ARRANGED
ALL THIS FROM JAIL

1885
01:27:26,404 --> 01:27:29,106
TO AVOID PROSECUTION
FOR EMBEZZLEMENT.

1886
01:27:29,173 --> 01:27:31,208
            NOW THAT HURTS.

1887
01:27:31,276 --> 01:27:33,143
            BECAUSE THIS
            WAS MY INTENTION

1888
01:27:33,211 --> 01:27:34,712
            FROM
            THE VERY BEGINNING.

1889
01:27:34,779 --> 01:27:36,813
            THE CHILDREN NEEDED
            A BALL PARK,

1890
01:27:36,881 --> 01:27:38,649
            AND I RESPONDED.

1891
01:27:39,551 --> 01:27:40,718
            SEE...

1892
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:45,789
    I KNOW HOW IT FEELS
    TO BE DISAPPOINTED.

1893
01:27:45,857 --> 01:27:48,792
    WHEN I WAS 7 YEARS OLD--
            NO, 8--

1894
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:50,794
    ALL I WANTED FOR CHRISTMAS

1895
01:27:50,862 --> 01:27:53,096
    WAS A NEW RED BICYCLE.

1896
01:27:53,164 --> 01:27:56,634
    MY FAVORITE UNCLE,
    UNCLE ALFRESCO,

1897
01:27:56,701 --> 01:28:01,505
    SWORE TO ME THAT HE WOULD
    BUY ME THAT BICYCLE.

1898
01:28:01,573 --> 01:28:05,542
    I COUNTED THE DAYS
    UNTIL CHRISTMAS.

1899
01:28:05,610 --> 01:28:07,344
    5:00, CHRISTMAS MORNING,

1900
01:28:07,412 --> 01:28:08,845
        I RUN DOWN--

1901
01:28:08,913 --> 01:28:11,014
                ALL RIGHT.
                NOBODY MOVE.

1902
01:28:11,983 --> 01:28:15,185
    THIS IS JUST BETWEEN
    VINNIE AND US.

1903
01:28:15,253 --> 01:28:18,122
        GUYS, I'M IN THE MIDDLE
        OF AN ANECDOTE.

1904
01:28:18,189 --> 01:28:20,523
            COME OVER HERE AND
            NOBODY GETS HURT.

1905
01:28:20,591 --> 01:28:21,658
                OK, OK.

1906
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:23,643
                COME ON, KIDS,
                MOVE BACK.

1907
01:28:23,712 --> 01:28:26,346
            AND EVERYBODY JUST
