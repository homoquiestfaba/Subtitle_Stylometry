1
00:00:55,633 --> 00:01:01,871
Remember, in times of trouble,
let your conscience be your guide.

2
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:16,354
Here goes.

3
00:02:26,953 --> 00:02:31,441
I never knew you were one
to jump to conclusions.

4
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:40,801
You can't get rid of me that easily.
I'll be back. You'll see!

5
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,356
Okay, kids. This is it.

6
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:27,867
- Well, that wasn't too bad.
- Oh, speak for yourself.

7
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:31,301
I personally was never cut out
to be a contortionist.

8
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:33,229
- A contortionist, what's that?
- It's a political party.

9
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:35,810
But don't worry, the Republicans
are still way ahead.

10
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,118
Well, actually, it means
a person's ability

11
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:41,287
to twist their body into
strange and unusual positions.

12
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:44,738
Well, that certainly sounds
like Roxanne to me.

13
00:06:45,426 --> 00:06:48,068
- Really?
- Oh, dream on.

14
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:49,790
Hey, let's get this stuff out.

15
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,199
I feel like I'm on display here
in the middle of the street.

16
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:53,675
Let's do it.

17
00:07:10,354 --> 00:07:13,228
Now, you girls understand the deal, right?
I drop you off,

18
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:14,975
you clean up the house
real good for the new owners,

19
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:17,705
I pick you up Monday morning,
and you each get 100 bucks.

20
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:20,241
My mouth's watering
just thinking about it.

21
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:24,262
A lousy 100 bucks.

22
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:27,679
You'd think there'd be an easier way
to earn some spending cash.

23
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:30,634
There is, but you'd have to
beat around the bush to get it.

24
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:32,150
And how!

25
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,122
- What did she mean by that?
- Just keep pulling out the stuff, Megan.

26
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,333
Hey, just sign this, saying you
understand the game.

27
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:39,189
And I can get
the hell outta here.

28
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:42,452
I hope someone has
the keys to this palace.

29
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:44,066
Don't worry.
As your team leader,

30
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,669
I've got everything we need
to get through the weekend.

31
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:48,465
Did you bring any men?

32
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:51,909
Oh, I see you're hiding them
under your shirt.

33
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:54,101
- Sign up, Roxanne.
- Oh.

34
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:56,334
Too bad, it's a couple of midgets.

35
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,916
Yeah, well, listen... In case
you didn't hear it down at the office,

36
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:00,890
there's no hanky panky
going on here.

37
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,593
You leave your boyfriends
down at the football field

38
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:03,795
or wherever the hell
you found them.

39
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:06,133
- Power even turned on?
- Well, the electricity is.

40
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:07,752
The phone's out until
the new owners move in.

41
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:09,892
Well, what if there's
an emergency or something?

42
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:14,265
Oh, I think we're suppose to go
running down the street screaming, right?

43
00:08:14,365 --> 00:08:16,790
No. There's a neigbor,
Mr. Hinchlow.

44
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,137
He's got a phone.
I spoke to him earlier in the day.

45
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:21,194
He's gonna drop by later
and introduce himself.

46
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:25,783
- Great, we can call out for pizza.
- Yeah, but remember, no monkey business.

47
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:29,616
- I got a reputation to think of.
- He's got his reputation to live down.

48
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:33,839
- Sleaze ball.
- Aw, I think he's kind of cute.

49
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:37,848
Well, in a weird, sort of
twisted way, of course.

50
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:39,754
Very twisted.

51
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:44,194
Let's get going, guys.

52
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:53,826
Guys. Hold on.

53
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,702
Oh, look. Hell House.

54
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:03,283
Looks like our
sorority house to me.

55
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:07,142
It displays a certain charm.
Not altogether unpleasant.

56
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:10,798
Maybe you can assume the mortgage
after the new owners disappear.

57
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:20,524
- Put this down.
- All right.

58
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:31,566
What was that stuff you were saying
about the new owners disappearing?

59
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:36,380
Well, this house has a long history
of mayhem and madness.

60
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,943
Pretty strange and unusual
and weird things have happened here.

61
00:09:40,043 --> 00:09:42,535
- Such as?
- Well...

62
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:45,906
It was the Mortimer family,
the last ones to live here

63
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:49,341
They simply vanished one night
after about a month of moving in.

64
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:52,514
- What happened to them?
- Nobody really knows.

65
00:09:52,614 --> 00:09:54,636
But it's assumed they took off
in the middle of the night,

66
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:58,064
so freaked out,
they left everything behind.

67
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,252
- Everything?
- Even their CD player.

68
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:02,820
No shit?

69
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,204
Let's get this junk in the kitchen
and see if the fridge is in working order.

70
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:08,567
Meg, go get the bags
from the street.

71
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:19,575
Okay.

72
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:42,988
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

73
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:45,012
Saw the van.
Figured it was you.

74
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,468
Thoght I'd stop by,
let you know I was here.

75
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:49,761
- Are you Mr...
- Hinchlow.

76
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:51,908
Yes, I have the house
down the block here.

77
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:54,190
I'm Megan.
I'm just here for the weekend.

78
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,534
Ah, short stay, huh?

79
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,363
Good thing.

80
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:03,575
Um, would you like
to meet the other girls?

81
00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:05,768
Oh, I'd be delighted.

82
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:10,105
You know, I remember this house
when it was only about that tall.

83
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:12,419
Oh, heh. No kidding?

84
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:17,262
I don't know about you guys,
but this place doesn't look so messy.

85
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:21,029
You know, it should be a cinch
if we all pitch in and get to it.

86
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:25,552
- Fridge is in working order.
- Great. Here, put this stuff in there.

87
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,592
- Ham.
- Yeah.

88
00:11:27,692 --> 00:11:29,658
- Cheese, cool.
- Mm.

89
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:31,725
Beers.

90
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,355
- And butter?
- Don't ask.

91
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:44,247
- Look who I found outside.
- Mr. Hinchlow?

92
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:46,396
Yeah.

93
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:48,212
You the guy with the phone?

94
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:53,643
- That's right.
- Well, I'm Terry. Hi.

95
00:11:53,743 --> 00:11:55,621
I represent
the Wheatley Cleaning Company.

96
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:58,540
And this is Roxanne
and Jan, and...

97
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,669
- I guess you already know Megan.
- I had the pleasure, yeah.

98
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:04,600
There something we can do
for you, Mr. Hinchlow?

99
00:12:06,312 --> 00:12:10,978
No. No, no, I just, uh...
Came in to have a look at your faces.

100
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:13,298
In case I have to
identify you later on.

101
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:16,836
- Identify us?
- Your bodies, I mean, for the cops.

102
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:21,745
- Um, if there's a need, you know?
- I'm afraid we don't know.

103
00:12:22,222 --> 00:12:25,278
Well, there's been several murders
in this neighborhood.

104
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:29,292
I... I wouldn't want anything
to happen to you girls, of course.

105
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:30,704
Of course.

106
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:33,450
Well, we really appreciate
your concern, Mr. Hinchlow.

107
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,578
And now, if you're done memorizing us,
we've got a lot of work to do.

108
00:12:36,678 --> 00:12:40,077
Of course. Uh, yes. Uh, well, if you
need anything I'm just down the block.

109
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:43,702
It's the brown house
that's slightly green with mold.

110
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:47,626
Just holler if you need anything.

111
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:50,187
Thanks.
We'll remember that.

112
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,866
- So now what?
- Well, I say we start in the basement.

113
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:58,601
- Why the basement?
- 'Cause it's dark and creepy.

114
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:00,716
And probably the last place
you wanna be after sundown.

115
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:02,010
You got it.

116
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,789
- Come on.
- Let's do it.

117
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,781
Why do these things
always have to start

118
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:11,708
with young, beautiful coeds
going into the basement?

119
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:22,340
This must be where
all the missing bodies are buried.

120
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,639
Don't worry.
We're not doing any digging.

121
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:29,229
- It's not in our job description.
- Come on.

122
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:36,173
Come on, scaredy-cat.
Get in there.

123
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,736
I just wanna be
the last one to get it.

124
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:42,322
Oh, come on.

125
00:13:56,738 --> 00:14:01,488
Well, what are you chickens waiting for?
Let's get the light turned on.

126
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:04,142
You do it. We're not budging.
It's dark in here.

127
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:07,396
Geez, it's just a basement.

128
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:16,971
Maybe to you, but I say
it's the guts of Hell House.

129
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:20,171
Is this the part where we
find the secret Ouija board

130
00:14:20,271 --> 00:14:22,477
and all become
possessed by demons?

131
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:26,262
No, I think this is the part
where we get just plain bored,

132
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:30,198
and get possessed by
the spirit of Mr. Clean.

133
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:35,163
Look, guys...
No bodies, no monsters.

134
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:39,286
Just an old storage space
that smells like a locker room.

135
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:42,829
- It's even too ugly to mop.
- So, what do we do with it?

136
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:45,775
Well, I say we just straighten up.
Now why don't you guys

137
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,187
stack up some of the boxes,
and we'll move things around.

138
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,772
It'll start looking better,
and we can call it a day.

139
00:14:50,872 --> 00:14:53,060
Terry's right.
Let's do it.

140
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:20,155
- Hey, check this out.
- What?

141
00:15:20,255 --> 00:15:22,998
What's the big deal?
There's a lot of trunks down here.

142
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:26,839
Yeah, but dig this tag.

143
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,733
I've seen a lot of odd languages,
but never one like this before.

144
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:44,157
I wonder what it says.

145
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:48,282
Probably some kind of travel tag
from an exotic location.

146
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:51,115
Yeah, in hell.

147
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:56,918
Come on, cut the ghost stories
and help me get it open.

148
00:15:57,653 --> 00:16:00,503
Oh, stink-o!

149
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,090
Smells like something died.

150
00:16:04,475 --> 00:16:05,878
Look here.

151
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:13,608
- Great. Where's the rest of him?
- There's more.

152
00:16:14,229 --> 00:16:15,470
- Well, that--
- Fuck!

153
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,965
That just about completes our tour
of Dr. Satan's neighborhood.

154
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:22,140
Tune in next week,
when we hear Roxanne say:

155
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,424
Let's get the hell out of here.

156
00:16:24,712 --> 00:16:28,126
- Yeah, we can finish tomorrow.
- I need some air.

157
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:30,686
Well, I'm gonna take
some of these things with me.

158
00:16:30,786 --> 00:16:34,161
- Why?
- They may be important.

159
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,086
Well, you remember
what that Hinchlow said.

160
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:42,386
- About bodies?
- Yeah. There may be clues.

161
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:46,166
What you're really trying to say,
is they may be antiques.

162
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:51,181
Valuable ones, that nobody but us
knows about or will miss.

163
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:54,230
Well, maybe.
But listen...

164
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,708
If they are valuables,
we'll split whatever we have, okay?

165
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,375
- Deal?
- Deal.

166
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:02,920
- Come on, let's get.
- Let's do it.

167
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:28,666
This place doesn't induce
much of an appetite in me.

168
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:31,140
Well, it isn't exactly Mama San's
brand of bologna

169
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,481
but it'll do if you're
as hungry as I am.

170
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:38,396
Great. A thunder storm.

171
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:40,498
How come every time
we stay at an old, spooky house

172
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:42,083
it has lightning and thunder?

173
00:17:42,183 --> 00:17:44,621
Well, I think it's standard issue.

174
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:47,196
- Let's go join the others.
- Okay.

175
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:33,691
How can you read that stuff
on a night like this?

176
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,457
In a house like this?

177
00:18:35,557 --> 00:18:37,987
"And then Reginald,
with an insane look,

178
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:40,976
grabbed the long, twisted
blade of the Demon Sword,

179
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:45,953
and plunged it deep into the exposed
breast of young, nubile Catherine."

180
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:48,476
Are you okay?

181
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:51,199
Just some sandwich
stuck in my throat.

182
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,381
Have you guys seen Rox?

183
00:19:01,386 --> 00:19:05,649
Wanna see how I got my hooks
in to Biff Bullock, the football captain?

184
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:07,827
Again?

185
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:09,347
I do!

186
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:12,907
Okay! Here's how it starts.
Ready?

187
00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:05,803
- Wow, that was interesting.
- Gets them every time.

188
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,394
Here. Come on.
I'll show you how.

189
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:13,314
- No, I couldn't. I--
- Come on.

190
00:20:13,414 --> 00:20:15,856
Come on, it's easy.

191
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,508
Come on.

192
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,840
- Stop!
- Come on!

193
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:23,903
Come on.

194
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:26,280
Hey, girl. Hold on.

195
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:31,470
Stop it.

196
00:20:33,324 --> 00:20:36,619
- Check her out.
- Oh, not too bad.

197
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:42,254
My, my. Where have you
been hinding that?

198
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:46,418
We've got some
stiff competition here, girls.

199
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:56,153
Remind me to show you
how to use it sometime.

200
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,407
Who could that be?

201
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:09,950
It's probably Hinchlow
looking for a good time.

202
00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:15,618
- We shouldn't answer it.
- Please, it's just a doorbell.

203
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,204
Can I help you?

204
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,833
Is there anything
we can do for you?

205
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,360
Delivery.

206
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:41,865
We don't live here.

207
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:44,247
And the new owners
won't be around until Monday.

208
00:21:44,347 --> 00:21:46,606
Maybe you should
come back then.

209
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:51,018
Delivery.

210
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,838
Uh, sure.

211
00:21:54,471 --> 00:21:56,814
Do I need to sign anything?

212
00:21:58,645 --> 00:22:03,755
Um, let's close the door.

213
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,393
- I wonder what it is.
- A box of candy?

214
00:22:26,493 --> 00:22:31,336
Look, it says: "Open immediately."
Let's see what's inside.

215
00:22:31,436 --> 00:22:34,449
No. It doesn't belong to us.

216
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:37,804
Well...
Maybe it's perishable.

217
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:40,677
And if we don't,
we might get in more trouble.

218
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:43,426
- There's a point.
- Well...

219
00:22:43,526 --> 00:22:45,801
Okay, but if it's not,
we wrap it right back.

220
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:47,827
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's open it.

221
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:02,290
Ooh, yuck.
What a hideous thing.

222
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,139
What is it?
A book or something?

223
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:10,052
It's the Transylvania
yellow pages, ooh.

224
00:23:10,152 --> 00:23:13,183
- Should we look inside?
- We've gone this far.

225
00:23:15,536 --> 00:23:21,650
- Ew! I don't really like touching this.
- It looks like somebody's face.

226
00:23:22,005 --> 00:23:26,627
- Probably human skin.
- Probably worth a fortune.

227
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:33,786
Hey, do any of you guys
read foreign languages?

228
00:23:33,886 --> 00:23:36,770
Jan, you do, don't you?

229
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,924
I know how to say
"how much?" in Spanish.

230
00:23:39,024 --> 00:23:45,265
I can answer that in five languages.
But that's all.

231
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:48,273
I'll bet little miss egghead upstairs
knows how to read this.

232
00:23:48,373 --> 00:23:50,832
Roxanne, why don't you
go up and find out?

233
00:23:51,258 --> 00:23:52,820
Okay.

234
00:24:11,005 --> 00:24:12,949
That is gross.

235
00:24:14,598 --> 00:24:16,372
It is.

236
00:24:17,213 --> 00:24:19,119
Now that's gross.

237
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:23,354
It's only a picture, but it looks like
some ancient sorcerer's wet dream.

238
00:24:23,454 --> 00:24:24,967
Yuck.

239
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:54,045
- Ready to rejoin the troops?
- I guess so.

240
00:25:54,145 --> 00:25:56,826
- A little embarrassed?
- No, I...

241
00:25:56,926 --> 00:25:59,419
- A little.
- Well, don't be.

242
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,691
I mean, you've got a great body.
You just need to get some use out of it.

243
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,309
What a night.

244
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:07,912
Yeah, but right now,
Terry wants you downstairs.

245
00:26:08,012 --> 00:26:12,537
Some creepy old man delivered
a book with a face on it.

246
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:15,053
And she thought maybe
you could read some of it

247
00:26:15,153 --> 00:26:16,976
and tell us what it's all about.

248
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,987
- Really?
- Yeah, so...

249
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:20,814
I could try.

250
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:24,444
Get a load of that drawing.

251
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:26,679
- Ew, it looks like they're--
- Doing it!

252
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:28,115
Gross!

253
00:26:28,215 --> 00:26:30,441
Look where that thing's
tongue is going.

254
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:32,951
Makes me squirm in my seat
just thinking about it.

255
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:36,853
Well, don't show it to Roxanne,
or she might wanna try it.

256
00:26:40,152 --> 00:26:43,576
- Where's that strange book?
- It's right here.

257
00:26:57,622 --> 00:27:01,803
- That guy's tongue is--
- Yeah, yeah, we saw it. So can you read it?

258
00:27:04,772 --> 00:27:08,027
Well, it looks like ancient Latin.

259
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:12,143
Great, the one class
I skipped regularly.

260
00:27:13,337 --> 00:27:15,370
Ooh, a handsome fellow.

261
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,616
Yeah, we know, but
can you make out anything?

262
00:27:18,716 --> 00:27:22,111
Well, it's kinda rough,
but I'll give it a try.

263
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:26,678
"Demons of the mind,
hear this summons."

264
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,998
"Give of our energy
to that of the unliving."

265
00:27:31,098 --> 00:27:34,786
"For that which lives not,
may never die."

266
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:37,747
Does it get any better?

267
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:42,046
"We, your devotet slaves,
give of our bodies,

268
00:27:42,146 --> 00:27:45,509
that thou may live
but a life unto death."

269
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:48,772
"We beg of you,
answer our pleas."

270
00:27:48,872 --> 00:27:52,889
- Okay, so are there any jokes in there?
- It gets pretty rocky after that.

271
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:54,558
What do you mean, rocky?

272
00:27:54,658 --> 00:27:57,854
Are you the Latin wiz
of this katonic ewe or what?

273
00:27:57,954 --> 00:28:02,977
Well, ancient demon incantations
aren't covered until next semester.

274
00:28:03,077 --> 00:28:04,035
Rats!

275
00:28:04,135 --> 00:28:07,620
Oh, wait a minute, here's a footnote.
I think I can read this.

276
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,117
"In the name of God,
if you value your immortal Soul,

277
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:17,786
never ever, ever, ever
read the above incantation aloud."

278
00:28:17,886 --> 00:28:20,819
"And I mean, don't. Never."

279
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:23,503
Well, that was fun.

280
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:28,398
- Any dirty pictures in here?
- Tons. But I'm turnin' in, not turnin' on.

281
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:32,191
Yeah, me too. And if you guys
had any sense, you would, too.

282
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:34,624
- I'm ready.
- Not me.

283
00:28:34,724 --> 00:28:38,480
- I'm expecting some company.
- Company?

284
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,937
Yeah. Biff Bullock said that he
might drop by around midnight.

285
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:47,062
You remember what Burt Wentworth
said about no monkey business?

286
00:28:47,162 --> 00:28:51,730
Sure, but Biff's not a monkey, and
he'll only be here for, like, an hour or so.

287
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,026
Who's gonna know?

288
00:28:53,126 --> 00:28:56,527
If it's Biff, it'll only be five minutes,
and the whole school's gonna know.

289
00:28:57,749 --> 00:28:59,999
- And Rox?
- Yeah?

290
00:29:00,622 --> 00:29:04,242
- He does look like a monkey.
- Oh, you're just jealous.

291
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:09,076
Listen, don't screw up this gig, okay?
Or we might get in some big trouble.

292
00:29:09,176 --> 00:29:11,273
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

293
00:29:13,455 --> 00:29:14,920
- Night.
- See ya.

294
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,749
- Later, kid.
- Night.

295
00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:23,466
Wow... how does he
get his tongue in there?

296
00:29:40,903 --> 00:29:42,667
This place sure spooks me.

297
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:45,100
Well, if you hear a scream
in the middle of the night,

298
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,369
it'll probably be Roxanne
losing her virginity for the fifth time.

299
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,554
I wish I had her
sense of adventure.

300
00:29:52,654 --> 00:29:55,515
Just be glad you don't have
her sense of propriety.

301
00:29:55,615 --> 00:30:00,835
But it must be so exciting to trice
for so many strong, muscular men.

302
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:04,099
"Trice?" Listen, Meg, the next time
you wanna know what it's like,

303
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:06,447
just do that little dance
Roxanne showed you.

304
00:30:06,547 --> 00:30:08,724
I'm sure that'll at least
cover the foreplay.

305
00:30:08,824 --> 00:30:11,610
- Was I good?
- Oh, honey, you were great.

306
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,082
Why, you just reeked of sex.

307
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:20,178
Okay, everyone, let's get some sleep
before the carnal olympics start downstairs.

308
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:12,104
Okay.

309
00:31:28,998 --> 00:31:30,763
Okay.

310
00:31:36,805 --> 00:31:38,708
Got you now, Biff.

311
00:32:32,635 --> 00:32:34,851
Oh, God.

312
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,908
Cool.

313
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:50,194
Okay.

314
00:34:14,414 --> 00:34:17,194
My, my, my.

315
00:34:35,843 --> 00:34:40,039
- Nice ass.
- Biff, is that you?

316
00:34:41,048 --> 00:34:44,199
Come on out.
I recognize your voice.

317
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:24,114
Yoo-hoo!

318
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,675
Time for din din.

319
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:38,701
Hello, baby.

320
00:35:42,617 --> 00:35:44,435
Nice tits!

321
00:35:51,058 --> 00:35:52,544
Listen.

322
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:55,878
Yup, that's number five.

323
00:35:56,474 --> 00:36:00,295
- You mean...?
- Well, they're not playing Twister.

324
00:36:02,468 --> 00:36:04,081
Maybe they are.

325
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:10,466
Oh, boy.

326
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:17,884
- It stopped.
- What did I tell you. That Biff?

327
00:36:17,984 --> 00:36:20,571
I didn't even hear the whistle
for the two minute warning.

328
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:24,531
Good boy. Well, they always said
he was the fastest guy on the team.

329
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:27,115
Now maybe we can
get some shut-eye.

330
00:36:27,215 --> 00:36:32,180
That did not sound like the extatic
coupling of young lovers to me.

331
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,313
Maybe she's in trouble.

332
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:37,947
Why don't you check in on them?
I'm sure they'd appreciate it.

333
00:36:38,047 --> 00:36:40,601
Well, maybe just a peek.

334
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:43,124
- To be sure?
- Help yourself.

335
00:36:43,224 --> 00:36:45,252
- And Meg?
- Yeah?

336
00:36:45,352 --> 00:36:48,841
Be sure to tell us where his tongue is.
I'm dying to know.

337
00:36:50,736 --> 00:36:52,586
She's such a drag.

338
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:09,496
Roxanne? Biff?

339
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:34,244
Hello?

340
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:40,512
Rox, you scared me to death!

341
00:37:40,612 --> 00:37:42,272
Hello, Meg.

342
00:37:42,372 --> 00:37:45,788
- Can I help you?
- What are you doing?

343
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:49,014
We heard screams, and now you're here,
naked and covered in blood.

344
00:37:49,114 --> 00:37:50,549
Are you okay?

345
00:37:54,547 --> 00:37:59,067
I cut myself opening a bottle of wine.
It ruined my nightgown.

346
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:03,367
- I was just changing.
- What about the screams?

347
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:07,990
So I got a little carried away.
Why don't you go back to bed?

348
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,722
I'm all right, and
Biff will be here soon.

349
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:13,642
We wouldn't want to
spoil the moment now, would we?

350
00:38:13,742 --> 00:38:17,222
No, of course not.
I was just worried about you.

351
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:23,837
- Megan, you're so sweet.
- Uh... well, goodnight.

352
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:26,485
Later.

353
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:45,963
What's gotten into you?

354
00:38:46,063 --> 00:38:49,329
Yeah, did you penalize him
five yards for illegal use of hands,

355
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:51,886
or was it backfield in motion?

356
00:38:51,986 --> 00:38:54,067
Biff's not here yet.

357
00:38:54,763 --> 00:38:56,063
Well...!

358
00:38:56,163 --> 00:38:59,739
I know what it is. Roxanne was
practicing for the big moment.

359
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,066
She was standing there like
some kind of robot or something.

360
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:06,283
- Naked and covered with blood.
- Are you kidding?

361
00:39:06,383 --> 00:39:09,459
She said she cut herself
and ruined her nightie, but...

362
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:11,539
I didn't see any cuts.

363
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:15,138
- Well, is she all right?
- She said she was, but...

364
00:39:15,238 --> 00:39:17,684
- But what?
- Well, I don't know.

365
00:39:17,784 --> 00:39:23,680
She was just really strange, weird.
It was really creepy.

366
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,991
Forget it, babe.
This whole place is creepy.

367
00:39:26,091 --> 00:39:28,396
Just try to get some sleep
if you can.

368
00:40:07,334 --> 00:40:09,555
Alive.

369
00:40:11,397 --> 00:40:13,857
Alive again!

370
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:32,666
Hiya, baby.

371
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,866
- You miss me?
- Like the plague.

372
00:40:38,973 --> 00:40:40,759
Neat place.

373
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:45,457
- You got your own room?
- The other girls are upstairs, so...

374
00:40:45,557 --> 00:40:49,124
I thought we'd camp out
down here for a while.

375
00:40:49,224 --> 00:40:51,139
Sounds swell, huh.

376
00:40:51,263 --> 00:40:55,273
Hey, what's--what's with the sticky stuff?
Uh... some kind of new lotion?

377
00:40:55,562 --> 00:40:59,260
Close.
Let's get comfortable.

378
00:40:59,601 --> 00:41:01,320
Sound great.

379
00:41:09,305 --> 00:41:13,758
Wine too, huh? You sure know
how to make a guy feel welcome.

380
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:17,213
I've been waiting
for you to come.

381
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:20,850
Oh, yeah.
Me too, baby.

382
00:41:21,819 --> 00:41:24,813
Here's where it gets fun.

383
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,457
Oh, yeah.

384
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:18,075
- Huh?
- What?

385
00:42:18,477 --> 00:42:20,736
I think Biff just screamed.

386
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:25,857
So lots of guys do.
Especially those who are with Roxanne.

387
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:28,876
It wasn't that kind of scream.

388
00:42:29,753 --> 00:42:32,596
Are you on that kick again?

389
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:35,634
I think somebody
should just check into it.

390
00:42:35,734 --> 00:42:39,329
- Well, I nominate you.
- And I second it.

391
00:42:39,429 --> 00:42:40,876
Why me?

392
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:43,465
Face it, Meg, all you wanna do is
see Roxanne in action

393
00:42:43,565 --> 00:42:45,133
and pick up a few pointers.

394
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:48,497
- I do not!
- Either way, it's a dark, stormy night.

395
00:42:48,597 --> 00:42:52,523
We're four young, attractive girls
in a big, spooky house, all alone.

396
00:42:52,623 --> 00:42:54,210
If we don't go downstairs
one at a time,

397
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:57,126
how will we ever get bumped off
without the others knowing about it?

398
00:42:57,226 --> 00:42:59,718
That's a terrible thing to say!

399
00:43:00,383 --> 00:43:01,968
Well, maybe.

400
00:43:02,196 --> 00:43:04,838
But I think you've got
the "you're it" syndrome.

401
00:43:04,938 --> 00:43:06,682
 You're gonna be
the first to get it,

402
00:43:06,782 --> 00:43:10,046
so you have to go downstairs and
check out the situation before we do.

403
00:43:10,146 --> 00:43:11,934
It's not our time to go yet.

404
00:43:12,034 --> 00:43:17,037
I think Jan's right; I think you've
got "you're it" written all over you.

405
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:19,367
You guys are just
trying to scare me!

406
00:43:19,467 --> 00:43:21,458
You're right, so why don't you
just go back to sleep

407
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:24,148
before Terry and I decide
to murder you ourselves?

408
00:43:26,514 --> 00:43:30,752
- Going anyway?
- I'm just going to the bathroom.

409
00:43:30,852 --> 00:43:33,546
Honest!
I'll be right back.

410
00:43:33,646 --> 00:43:37,091
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

411
00:43:39,104 --> 00:43:43,801
- That kid is weird.
- Yeah, she is.

412
00:43:48,718 --> 00:43:52,026
<i>A canvas is a canvas
or a painting.</i>

413
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,357
<i>A rock is a rock or a statue.</i>

414
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:59,807
<i>A sound is a sound
or it's music.</i>

415
00:44:14,464 --> 00:44:17,585
<i>Come on. Be a nose.</i>

416
00:44:20,581 --> 00:44:22,153
<i>Be a nose.</i>

417
00:44:48,301 --> 00:44:50,087
<i>Frankie, shut up!</i>

418
00:44:51,929 --> 00:44:55,357
<i>Oh, what's the matter, Frankie?
How'd you get yourself stuck in the wall?</i>

419
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:58,925
<i>Wait a minute.
I'll get you out.</i>

420
00:45:08,565 --> 00:45:09,767
Hello.

421
00:45:10,851 --> 00:45:12,695
Yes, it's Burt. Who's this?

422
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:17,720
Hinchlow? What the hell do you want?
You know what time it is?

423
00:45:20,914 --> 00:45:24,264
No, I'm watching TV.
What the hell are you doing right now?

424
00:45:26,482 --> 00:45:27,745
Yeah, well, I didn't
give you this number

425
00:45:27,845 --> 00:45:30,220
so you could call me up
in the middle of the night and bug me!

426
00:45:34,978 --> 00:45:36,371
They did what?

427
00:45:37,482 --> 00:45:39,938
Screaming at the top
of their lungs?

428
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:44,328
Were they screaming in pleasure,
or something like that?

429
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,098
You know, one of those girls
is a contortionist.

430
00:45:49,123 --> 00:45:51,258
Yeah, it's a political party.

431
00:45:53,092 --> 00:45:56,618
Oh, in terror?
Real blood-curdling stuff?

432
00:45:58,743 --> 00:46:02,140
What? And a guy
parked his car out in front?

433
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,003
What the hell are you doing,
watching them with a telescope?

434
00:46:05,826 --> 00:46:08,248
Oh yeah?
What kinda lense you got?

435
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:11,449
Now, listen...
Okay, okay.

436
00:46:11,549 --> 00:46:14,608
Yeah, I'll be over there.
This better be serious.

437
00:46:20,014 --> 00:46:22,655
<i>A nice, fresh piece
of halibut for ya.</i>

438
00:46:27,323 --> 00:46:29,538
<i>I'll give you to her
in the morning.</i>

439
00:46:31,847 --> 00:46:34,707
How come this guy
never won an academy award?

440
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:43,929
- Burt, honey?
- Yeah?

441
00:46:44,029 --> 00:46:46,364
- Where ya goin'?
- Out.

442
00:46:46,464 --> 00:46:48,626
I gotta go check on those broads
I left at the old house.

443
00:46:48,726 --> 00:46:53,602
- Something funny's going on there.
- But Burt, it's Friday.

444
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,261
So what? I gotta go.

445
00:46:56,801 --> 00:47:01,072
Burt, Friday night.

446
00:47:02,388 --> 00:47:05,412
Why does every week have to
have a Friday night in it?

447
00:47:18,549 --> 00:47:21,210
You're gonna hurt yourself
like that some day.

448
00:47:54,231 --> 00:47:57,472
- That's Meg.
- Maybe she really was it.

449
00:47:57,572 --> 00:48:01,500
Now we gotta go down there.
Things may be getting a little rough.

450
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,512
We should get something heavy in case
we have to conk that Biff on the noggin.

451
00:48:04,612 --> 00:48:06,973
Yeah.
Don't spare the weight.

452
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,103
- How's this?
- It's a killer.

453
00:48:11,203 --> 00:48:14,068
Let's go. But quietly.
- Okay.

454
00:48:37,588 --> 00:48:40,431
Meg!
Are you all right?

455
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:43,119
Biff's dead.

456
00:48:43,641 --> 00:48:45,279
Oh, shit.

457
00:48:46,212 --> 00:48:48,542
Why is he covered
with this tapestry?

458
00:48:48,642 --> 00:48:51,062
Someone's trying to hide the body.

459
00:48:51,484 --> 00:48:53,943
That's like sweeping him
under the rug.

460
00:48:54,228 --> 00:48:57,323
- It's a soul shroud.
- A what?

461
00:48:57,423 --> 00:49:01,112
A soul shroud.
When souls are offered up to Satan,

462
00:49:01,212 --> 00:49:04,816
they go by means
of a soul shroud, to Hell.

463
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:07,784
Sort of like gift wrapping.

464
00:49:07,884 --> 00:49:12,001
Gift wrapping?
Happy fucking birthday.

465
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:16,919
- How'd you know that?
- It says so, right there on the corner.

466
00:49:23,737 --> 00:49:25,382
Who's that?

467
00:49:35,886 --> 00:49:38,613
Come on, girls, open up.
It's me, Burt.

468
00:49:44,918 --> 00:49:47,787
<i>- What do you want?</i>
- What do I want?

469
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,270
I want what any man wants.

470
00:49:50,633 --> 00:49:53,849
I wanna be called up in the middle
of the night and gotten out of bed.

471
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:57,061
I wanna go for a ride in my car
in the middle of a thunder storm.

472
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:01,171
Find out if there's any trouible down here.
What the hell do you think I want?

473
00:50:02,447 --> 00:50:05,369
- What do you mean?
- I mean, Hinchlow called me.

474
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:08,108
Said someone was screaming down here
loud enough to wake the dead,

475
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:10,120
he thought there
might be some trouble.

476
00:50:10,524 --> 00:50:13,748
He also said he thought he saw
a guy coming here a little while ago.

477
00:50:13,848 --> 00:50:15,817
You know anything about that?

478
00:50:16,408 --> 00:50:17,737
- No.
- Nope.

479
00:50:19,618 --> 00:50:22,406
Well, let me in. I wanna see
if everything's okay.

480
00:50:22,506 --> 00:50:24,993
We can't.
We're not dressed.

481
00:50:25,093 --> 00:50:27,538
Well, toss somethin' on.
I haven't got all night.

482
00:50:35,761 --> 00:50:38,780
- We've got to hide this body.
- You mean touch that guy?

483
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,818
Look, he's already dead,
we can't help that.

484
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:44,239
But if Burt finds out he was here,
we're gonna get fired.

485
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:48,992
But is it worth a mere 100 bucks
to become implicated in a murder?

486
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:50,692
- Yep.
- Yes.

487
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:52,446
Let's do it.
Come on.

488
00:50:55,284 --> 00:50:57,019
Were do we put him?
He weighs a ton.

489
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,715
Uh, the kitchen.
It'll be easier to clean up later.

490
00:50:59,815 --> 00:51:02,627
- How do you think this happened?
- Who knows?

491
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:06,242
Looks like Roxanne gave him
an eternal hickey.

492
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,045
Okay.

493
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,268
Oh, man!

494
00:51:25,421 --> 00:51:27,381
Where is Roxanne?

495
00:51:27,744 --> 00:51:29,489
I never saw her.

496
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:32,532
I think she ran away
after killing Biff.

497
00:51:39,807 --> 00:51:43,134
Hey, chickies, come on.
I'm catching my death out here.

498
00:51:43,902 --> 00:51:46,459
You'll have to
come around back.

499
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,331
- This door's locked.
- Oh, it's you.

500
00:51:49,431 --> 00:51:51,995
What the hell's going on here?
Everybody's acting so screwy.

501
00:51:52,095 --> 00:51:56,433
Well, if you'll come with me,
I can explain everything.

502
00:51:56,533 --> 00:52:02,361
- This better be good.
- Oh, it will be.

503
00:52:08,207 --> 00:52:10,697
Okay, everybody.
Cool and calm.

504
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:13,102
- Yeah, right, cool and calm. Cool...
- Okay.

505
00:52:13,449 --> 00:52:15,525
- Calm...
- Okay.

506
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:16,812
- Okay, ready?
- Okay.

507
00:52:16,912 --> 00:52:18,922
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

508
00:52:27,206 --> 00:52:28,426
Where is he?

509
00:52:28,526 --> 00:52:30,186
Maybe he split.
He looked kinda loaded.

510
00:52:30,286 --> 00:52:32,210
I guess he got tired of waiting.

511
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:35,682
Lucky for us, but we still
have to deal with the Biff situation.

512
00:52:35,782 --> 00:52:38,769
Don't worry.
I'll think of something.

513
00:52:50,605 --> 00:52:54,323
Now here is where
it all started.

514
00:52:54,423 --> 00:52:57,946
- I'm still with ya.
- Now, stay close.

515
00:52:58,111 --> 00:53:00,263
It's dark in here.

516
00:53:12,158 --> 00:53:14,347
Ah, some dump.

517
00:53:14,447 --> 00:53:17,204
We just started cleaning
this afternoon.

518
00:53:18,263 --> 00:53:20,975
It ain't terrible, but
it's got a ways to go yet.

519
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:28,087
Here is where we found
the sacred shroud and dagger.

520
00:53:28,386 --> 00:53:34,134
This is where
all the trouble began.

521
00:53:38,998 --> 00:53:41,169
Trouble? What trouble?

522
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:49,712
You lookin' for trouble?

523
00:53:52,844 --> 00:53:56,013
I'm trouble.

524
00:53:56,389 --> 00:53:57,846
Oh, boy.

525
00:53:58,949 --> 00:54:00,560
Oh, boy.

526
00:54:07,212 --> 00:54:08,844
Oh, boy.

527
00:54:11,077 --> 00:54:13,702
Oh, boy. Oh, boy!

528
00:54:13,802 --> 00:54:17,512
Oh, boy!
Oh! Oh, boy!

529
00:54:18,396 --> 00:54:21,308
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

530
00:54:23,237 --> 00:54:25,192
Oh my God!

531
00:54:32,661 --> 00:54:34,672
Look at this.

532
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,696
- What is it?
- Roxanne's nightie.

533
00:54:36,796 --> 00:54:38,883
Or what's left of it.

534
00:54:38,983 --> 00:54:41,408
- Do you think...
- Biff attacked her?

535
00:54:41,508 --> 00:54:44,120
She had to grease him
in self-defense?

536
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,307
Sure looks like it.

537
00:54:47,677 --> 00:54:49,680
Oh, check this out.

538
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:52,137
- What?
- Remember the drawing of the beast?

539
00:54:52,237 --> 00:54:54,550
- It's gone.
- Maybe somebody ripped it out.

540
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:57,526
I don't think so.
Everything else is the same.

541
00:54:57,626 --> 00:54:59,743
- But the drawing is vanished.
- Hey, look, guys.

542
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:01,646
I think we have
more important things to do

543
00:55:01,746 --> 00:55:04,409
than to worry about
some old witch's coloring book.

544
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:07,707
Look, it says something
about the beast on this page.

545
00:55:08,854 --> 00:55:11,834
And there's the darwing of the dagger
that we found in the cellar earlier.

546
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:13,534
Well, can you read it?

547
00:55:14,058 --> 00:55:15,587
I'll try.

548
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:19,321
It says that, in reading
the incantation out loud...

549
00:55:19,421 --> 00:55:22,346
- The one you read out loud earlier?
- Right.

550
00:55:22,446 --> 00:55:25,072
That, in reading the spell,
the spirit of the beast

551
00:55:25,172 --> 00:55:27,631
will be released into
the world of the living,

552
00:55:27,731 --> 00:55:30,719
to corrupt, kill,
and collect souls.

553
00:55:30,819 --> 00:55:33,128
It even mentions the soul shroud.

554
00:55:33,228 --> 00:55:35,322
What about this?

555
00:55:36,263 --> 00:55:39,491
It says that
it'll kill the beast, if...

556
00:55:39,591 --> 00:55:41,161
I can't understand the rest.

557
00:55:41,261 --> 00:55:43,384
Well, I'm not ready to believe
that the drawing in that book

558
00:55:43,484 --> 00:55:45,470
is alive and running
around the house somewhere.

559
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:50,022
Look, everybody, somebody cooled Biff,
and it wasn't one of us.

560
00:55:50,122 --> 00:55:51,891
If it'll make you feel any better,
we'll find Rox.

561
00:55:51,991 --> 00:55:56,091
- I'm sure she can explain everything.
- Okay, gals. Let's go. Come on.

562
00:56:12,532 --> 00:56:15,751
Why are we starting in the basement?
I hate the basement.

563
00:56:15,851 --> 00:56:18,725
I think it's better if we start at the bottom
and work our way up.

564
00:56:18,825 --> 00:56:21,520
I wouldn't want this to be
the last place we ended up in.

565
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:24,586
Hey, look. The light's on.
Maybe somebody's down there.

566
00:56:24,686 --> 00:56:26,867
- Oh, great.
- Come on.

567
00:56:37,381 --> 00:56:40,990
- Nobody's here. Let's go.
- Not so fast.

568
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:43,089
It's obvious someone's been here.

569
00:56:43,189 --> 00:56:47,172
- And recently.
- Well, it's obvious they're not here now.

570
00:56:55,105 --> 00:56:58,394
Boy, are my feet killing me.

571
00:57:04,892 --> 00:57:07,211
What the hell's with you two?

572
00:57:52,875 --> 00:57:53,909
What are we gonna do?

573
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:55,907
We don't have a car,
we don't have a phone.

574
00:57:56,007 --> 00:57:59,108
- We don't got shit.
- Okay, everybody calm down.

575
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:02,839
Now, we know Roxanne is dead.
That means there's somebody else around.

576
00:58:02,939 --> 00:58:05,433
- Maybe even in this house.
- The beast in the book!

577
00:58:05,533 --> 00:58:08,987
Will you stop with the frickin' beast?
This is reality!

578
00:58:09,087 --> 00:58:10,803
Now, let's get to the kitchen
and get a big knife.

579
00:58:10,903 --> 00:58:11,990
Then what?

580
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:13,618
Then we get our asses
over to Mr. Hinchlow's,

581
00:58:13,718 --> 00:58:15,145
use his telephone
and call the cops.

582
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:16,706
There goes our paychecks.

583
00:58:16,806 --> 00:58:19,570
Hey, Burt's dead, so
who is gonna pay us anyway?

584
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:20,550
You're right.

585
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:23,834
Well, at least we don't have
to clean up the place. Come on.

586
00:58:30,179 --> 00:58:31,734
Biff's gone!

587
00:58:31,834 --> 00:58:33,975
That means the killer
is probably still here!

588
00:58:34,075 --> 00:58:37,119
Well, I guess those owners
didn't exactly leave everything behind.

589
00:58:37,219 --> 00:58:38,540
So now what?

590
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:40,987
Well, there's a dagger
out on the coffee table.

591
00:58:41,087 --> 00:58:42,884
Right, let's get it!

592
00:58:46,747 --> 00:58:50,965
- Oh, geez, don't do that!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

593
00:58:51,065 --> 00:58:54,180
I just saw your boss pull up in front,
and I thought I'd check on you myself.

594
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,250
- Everything all right?
- No, everything's not okay.

595
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:59,633
- Someone's killed three of our friends.
- I was afraid of that.

596
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:03,637
- There's something very odd about this place.
- We're figuring that out.

597
00:59:03,737 --> 00:59:05,156
Can we use your phone?

598
00:59:05,256 --> 00:59:06,816
Oh, certainly.
I live down the block.

599
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:08,224
F-follow me.

600
00:59:16,737 --> 00:59:20,077
Very strange weather we're having.
They say it might rain.

601
00:59:20,177 --> 00:59:23,747
You sure you wanna go out
in that weather dressed like this?

602
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:26,976
Buddy, we'd go out
naked if we had to.

603
00:59:27,076 --> 00:59:30,132
- Well, let's get the dagger for protection.
- Yeah, let's do it.

604
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:35,093
Y-y-you don't need that.
You're perfectly safe with me.

605
00:59:35,757 --> 00:59:39,174
Just a little insurance,
Mr. Hinchlow.

606
00:59:39,794 --> 00:59:41,732
You ever seen this before?

607
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:43,758
Well...

608
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:47,094
It's a wild guess...

609
00:59:47,526 --> 00:59:50,841
...but I'd say that this...

610
00:59:50,941 --> 00:59:54,832
...is an ancient Cantarian warlock's
demon spell book

611
00:59:54,932 --> 00:59:57,960
from late
17th century England,

612
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:02,455
brought here by Gideon Fisk
in the early 1930s.

613
01:00:02,555 --> 01:00:06,630
And the source of
all the problems in this house.

614
01:00:12,548 --> 01:00:14,743
Sounds like you know it
pretty well, Mr. Hinchlow.

615
01:00:14,843 --> 01:00:17,390
You might say I've
gotten something out of it.

616
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:18,953
Roxanne!

617
01:00:19,053 --> 01:00:21,493
- You're alive.
- Where's Hinchlow? He was just there.

618
01:00:21,593 --> 01:00:23,385
Mr. Hinchlow's gone.

619
01:00:23,485 --> 01:00:25,957
That still doesn't explain
how you happen to be alive.

620
01:00:26,057 --> 01:00:28,028
We thought you were dead.

621
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:30,509
Yeah, was it some kind of
joke or something?

622
01:00:30,609 --> 01:00:34,914
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist
playing a trick on you.

623
01:00:35,014 --> 01:00:38,508
I mean, this place
is so spooky.

624
01:00:38,608 --> 01:00:40,687
You mean Biff and Burt
are in on this, too?

625
01:00:40,787 --> 01:00:44,904
- Ooh, I could just kill you guys.
- Please, not yet.

626
01:00:45,004 --> 01:00:46,424
What's with the book?

627
01:00:46,524 --> 01:00:50,278
Meg thought some drawing came to life
and was trying to kill all of us.

628
01:00:50,378 --> 01:00:54,208
That's pretty far out.
Can I see?

629
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,494
Remember that horrible drawing?

630
01:00:57,594 --> 01:01:02,002
The one of that ugly, disgusting,
repuslive, inhuman slime beast?

631
01:01:02,102 --> 01:01:06,645
- Yes. I remember.
- Well, the drawing is gone.

632
01:01:06,745 --> 01:01:11,329
Meg, I think your eyes
must be playing tricks on you.

633
01:01:11,429 --> 01:01:15,632
- I don't think so.
- Such an imagination.

634
01:01:15,732 --> 01:01:19,906
- So where's Biff and that Burt jerk?
- In the cellar.

635
01:01:20,006 --> 01:01:23,967
Probably laughing
their heads off right now.

636
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:28,800
- Come on, girls. Let's go kick some butt.
- Let's do it.

637
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,526
All right, macho man, the game's over!
Get up on your feet!

638
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:55,914
You slimeballs are really
in for it now, come on!

639
01:02:00,124 --> 01:02:03,383
That was really cruel, you guys!
Not funny at all!

640
01:02:06,619 --> 01:02:08,749
Playing possum, huh?

641
01:02:08,849 --> 01:02:11,866
Let's see if I can kick
a field goal this time!

642
01:02:19,189 --> 01:02:20,887
Roxanne...

643
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:25,086
- I don't think this guy's kidding us.
- He's not.

644
01:02:26,183 --> 01:02:27,878
Oh, shit!

645
01:02:29,051 --> 01:02:30,879
Meg was right.

646
01:02:31,276 --> 01:02:35,350
The book is one picture short.

647
01:02:35,955 --> 01:02:37,710
And it's me.

648
01:02:38,908 --> 01:02:40,877
You let me out.

649
01:02:41,314 --> 01:02:43,869
I suppose I should
thank you for that.

650
01:02:45,036 --> 01:02:48,320
But I haven't
got the time right now.

651
01:02:50,022 --> 01:02:53,567
- Where's Roxanne?
- Why, dead, of course.

652
01:02:53,667 --> 01:02:59,176
After my release, I needed
only a taste of human blood

653
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:04,254
to be come real again,
but I can only truly be free

654
01:03:04,354 --> 01:03:09,705
if I send the master
some fresh souls for his collection.

655
01:03:09,805 --> 01:03:13,469
- Us?
- Yes, he'll like you.

656
01:03:13,569 --> 01:03:15,257
Nice tits.

657
01:03:15,357 --> 01:03:19,172
Of course, getting there
is the unpleasant part.

658
01:03:19,872 --> 01:03:22,682
I think the book said
that the beast could be destroyed

659
01:03:22,782 --> 01:03:25,460
by plunging that old dagger
into its heart.

660
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,425
Great, I left it upstairs.

661
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:32,197
I think Terry and Jan
should go first.

662
01:03:32,591 --> 01:03:36,393
You and I can play for
a little while if you want to, Meg.

663
01:03:36,668 --> 01:03:41,249
- K-know any good games?
- I think we should make a break for it.

664
01:03:41,616 --> 01:03:44,453
- Ooh, when?
- Now!

665
01:04:00,791 --> 01:04:03,091
Oh, Meg, let's get going!
Come on!

666
01:04:53,245 --> 01:04:55,084
Meg, get the knife!

667
01:04:58,423 --> 01:05:00,811
It's gone!
The knife is gone!

668
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:06,089
- She's upstairs!
- What are we gonna do?

669
01:05:07,138 --> 01:05:08,708
Why don't you
check out the book?

670
01:05:08,808 --> 01:05:11,050
There must be some other way
to kill her.

671
01:05:14,364 --> 01:05:18,119
- Well?
- I'm too scared! My brain won't work.

672
01:05:18,219 --> 01:05:19,386
Shit!

673
01:05:22,987 --> 01:05:26,777
- Maybe this'll do the trick.
- The book only mentions a dagger.

674
01:05:26,877 --> 01:05:29,974
Well, fuck the dagger!
This is all we've got! Come on!

675
01:05:30,074 --> 01:05:31,474
Come on!

676
01:05:33,874 --> 01:05:35,608
Where are we going?

677
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:39,099
- Straight to Hell, if you don't watch it.
- We've got to get her.

678
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:41,391
If we wait for her,
we're gonna be sitting ducks.

679
01:05:41,491 --> 01:05:43,489
Well, we can make a run for it.
We don't have to fight it.

680
01:05:43,589 --> 01:05:47,673
Look, kid, if we don't get it right now,
it might be loose forever, and then what?

681
01:05:47,773 --> 01:05:50,926
I mean, we've got some kind of
supernatural monster running around!

682
01:05:51,026 --> 01:05:54,152
It's not gonna just leave us alone
because we ran away from it!

683
01:05:54,252 --> 01:05:55,871
- But--
- No buts!

684
01:05:55,971 --> 01:05:58,057
Now, we've gotta do this
while we have a chance!

685
01:05:58,157 --> 01:06:01,745
Okay, this thing has killed our friends!
Now we've gotta do something!

686
01:06:01,845 --> 01:06:04,544
We can go to Hinchlow's and call the cops.
Let them handle it.

687
01:06:04,644 --> 01:06:07,002
How do we really know
that Hinchlow is Hinchlow?

688
01:06:07,102 --> 01:06:09,906
Now come on!
Let's kick some monster butt!

689
01:06:47,555 --> 01:06:50,674
- Don't do that!
- Sorry.

690
01:07:05,476 --> 01:07:07,176
I don't see her.

691
01:07:10,446 --> 01:07:12,963
Get away from me,
you monster!

692
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,676
Run, Meg! Run!

693
01:07:44,851 --> 01:07:48,893
It's just you and me now, Meg.

694
01:08:16,472 --> 01:08:19,497
I'm coming for you, Meg.

695
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:26,107
We have some unfinished business
to take care of.

696
01:08:26,207 --> 01:08:29,109
I hope you're not too tired.

697
01:09:11,766 --> 01:09:16,003
Tangy, but not too tart.

698
01:09:28,737 --> 01:09:32,874
This is a very old
piece of material.

699
01:09:33,249 --> 01:09:38,753
All I have to do, is place this
over your body when you're dead,

700
01:09:38,853 --> 01:09:44,547
and your soul will fly
to Hell... like that.

701
01:09:50,201 --> 01:09:53,642
But you have to be
careful how you use it.

702
01:09:53,927 --> 01:09:57,658
- It can be very indiscriminate.
- Why are you doing this?

703
01:09:57,758 --> 01:10:00,254
You're free!
What more do you want?

704
01:10:00,354 --> 01:10:02,456
Can't you guess?

705
01:10:03,849 --> 01:10:05,407
No?

706
01:10:05,507 --> 01:10:08,408
I want all the others
set free, too.

707
01:10:08,508 --> 01:10:10,989
All the pictures in the book.

708
01:10:11,089 --> 01:10:14,843
They want to live again, too.
Just like me.

709
01:10:14,943 --> 01:10:17,583
I want you to read
that incantation out loud.

710
01:10:17,683 --> 01:10:21,622
Again and again,
until they've all been released.

711
01:10:21,722 --> 01:10:27,840
And then I want to eat your soul.

712
01:10:41,586 --> 01:10:44,195
So, it's you.

713
01:10:44,842 --> 01:10:46,451
Yes.

714
01:10:49,785 --> 01:10:55,135
- Get lost on your way to Hell?
- I've come to destroy you.

715
01:10:56,834 --> 01:11:00,119
And you think that
will save your soul

716
01:11:00,219 --> 01:11:03,708
from the eternal damnation
you brought upon yourself?

717
01:11:03,808 --> 01:11:05,996
It's a good place to start.

718
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:08,558
You'll never be free.

719
01:11:08,658 --> 01:11:13,309
As long as there's a dark side,
we'll always be here.

720
01:11:13,409 --> 01:11:16,140
Waiting. Ready.

721
01:11:16,534 --> 01:11:20,919
You can't kill us.
We're too strong for you.

722
01:11:21,019 --> 01:11:24,168
- For anyone.
- I can try.

723
01:11:24,268 --> 01:11:27,743
After all, you're
nothing but a doodle.

724
01:11:27,843 --> 01:11:31,226
- How dare you!
- I may have failed in the past.

725
01:11:31,326 --> 01:11:35,165
But this time I'm going to
erase you once and for all.

726
01:11:35,265 --> 01:11:39,709
And how do you plan to
accomplish that, Gideon Fisk?

727
01:11:39,809 --> 01:11:42,502
With this.

728
01:13:03,174 --> 01:13:05,797
Man, that really hurts.

729
01:13:06,814 --> 01:13:09,500
Better get back in that book.

730
01:13:10,314 --> 01:13:12,868
The book!
It's trying to get back into the book.

731
01:13:12,968 --> 01:13:15,733
If that happens,
it can never be destroyed.

732
01:13:17,076 --> 01:13:19,555
The fireplace!
We can burn it.

733
01:13:25,371 --> 01:13:28,185
If I can just make it
another step or two.

734
01:13:28,285 --> 01:13:32,416
Oh, boy, this really
cracks me up.

735
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:39,696
Hey, where ya going, baby?
Don't be so hasty.

736
01:13:39,796 --> 01:13:43,035
Not the fire! No!
Anything but the fire!

737
01:13:43,135 --> 01:13:46,050
- Throw it in the fire!
- Oh, I was hoping he wouldn't say that.

738
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:47,490
Now!

739
01:13:50,838 --> 01:13:53,721
Oh, man, why'd you
have to do that?

740
01:14:00,705 --> 01:14:04,866
You little bitch!
I'll get you in the sequel for this!

741
01:14:13,025 --> 01:14:19,203
What a world!
I'm melting!

742
01:14:54,898 --> 01:14:58,579
I suppose you're wondering
what this is all about.

743
01:14:59,474 --> 01:15:01,448
I know I must seem
a little late to you,

744
01:15:01,548 --> 01:15:04,428
but I had to wait
for the right time to act.

745
01:15:04,528 --> 01:15:06,171
What happened?

746
01:15:07,317 --> 01:15:11,822
I'm the one who brought the book
to America years ago.

747
01:15:11,922 --> 01:15:15,590
I thought it held knowledge.
How wrong I was.

748
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:21,463
I released a terror that has cursed me
for an eternity, until now.

749
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:24,346
I don't understand.
Who are you?

750
01:15:25,495 --> 01:15:28,492
I am the cause of all the misery.

751
01:15:28,592 --> 01:15:31,854
For years after my death,
I waited in limbo,

752
01:15:31,954 --> 01:15:34,730
hoping to find someone
who could transform the book

753
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:37,768
into a living thing,
so I could destroy it.

754
01:15:37,868 --> 01:15:41,990
Now you've done that for me,
and it's over.

755
01:15:42,513 --> 01:15:44,531
So now what happens?

756
01:15:45,252 --> 01:15:52,090
The curse which hangs over me
because of my evil mischief has lifted,

757
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:55,518
and the demon
is vanquished to Hell.

758
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:58,472
Your world is safe now.

759
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:00,186
Yes...

760
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:06,264
...but all my friends are dead,
because of your mischief.

761
01:16:07,075 --> 01:16:08,833
Oh, I don't think so.

762
01:16:08,933 --> 01:16:11,641
I think you'll find them
very much alive.

763
01:16:11,741 --> 01:16:15,778
You see, the beast
never truly existed.

764
01:16:15,991 --> 01:16:19,620
And now, neither do I.

765
01:16:21,668 --> 01:16:25,169
Goodbye, little one.
Good luck.

766
01:16:54,832 --> 01:16:57,886
Hey, Meg.
What are you doing up so early?

767
01:16:58,813 --> 01:17:02,067
Oh, God, it's you!
It's really you!

768
01:17:02,398 --> 01:17:04,778
Well, of course it's me.

769
01:17:06,408 --> 01:17:08,747
Hey, where are the others?

770
01:17:09,349 --> 01:17:11,580
In the cellar, I think.

771
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:17,076
Did you guys have a party last night
after I crashed out, or what?

772
01:17:17,176 --> 01:17:21,052
Yeah, sort of.
But I think it's over now.

773
01:17:22,349 --> 01:17:23,947
Morning, kids!

774
01:17:27,753 --> 01:17:30,946
Thought I'd stop by
to see how your night was.

775
01:17:31,624 --> 01:17:35,665
It was rough, Mr. Hinchlow.
I think I sprained my knee or something.

776
01:17:35,765 --> 01:17:40,577
- They were partying all night.
- Oh, is that so?

777
01:17:40,677 --> 01:17:45,570
Well, I think I have an Ace bandage
down at my place if you'd like to use it.

778
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:49,160
But first, how about
some hot coffee?

779
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:53,075
- I brung it on my thermos!
- I think I could use it.

780
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:59,144
- My God, what a hangover.
- You're telling me.

781
01:17:59,332 --> 01:18:00,567
What happened?

782
01:18:00,667 --> 01:18:03,076
I don't know, but you guys
have some explaining to do.

783
01:18:03,176 --> 01:18:06,571
I don't even remember
who I did it with.

784
01:18:07,031 --> 01:18:09,346
At least you're alive.

785
01:18:09,446 --> 01:18:12,967
I brought along my portable TV set
in case you'd like to use it.

786
01:18:13,067 --> 01:18:15,516
That's nice, but why?

787
01:18:15,671 --> 01:18:18,410
Hell, it's Saturday morning.

788
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:22,540
Don't tell me you kids
don't enjoy a good cartoon?
