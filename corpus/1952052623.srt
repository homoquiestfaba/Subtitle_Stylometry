1
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:51,500
I know that.

2
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:55,823
And for every 9 stocks that fell,
8 advanced. It's not Black Friday.

3
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,804
Then, go back with that asshole
that talked into going on Enron.

4
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:07,638
You know what?
Fuck you, too.

5
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,333
Della?

6
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,229
Della, honey?

7
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,133
What?

8
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,239
What's the matter?

9
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,167
What's the matter?

10
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,297
Honey, you want to tell me
what it is you do all day?

11
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:46,419
- What do you mean?
- Well...

12
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:50,736
Honey, look at the goddamn place.

13
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:55,667
There's kid-shit all over
the place, wall to wall.

14
00:04:57,112 --> 00:04:59,567
We do the best we can.

15
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:04,208
The best you can? Why don't you
just do what I tell you to do?

16
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,431
- Stop.
- Tell me. What happened to you?

17
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:10,262
- Stop.
- You should put yourself together.

18
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:15,222
What do you want me
to say? We've got kids.

19
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:18,736
I don't want you to say anything.
Just to keep the house clean!

20
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,907
God.

21
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,685
- Terry got an "A" in math.
- Goddamn it, Della!

22
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:32,184
- Don't what?
- That's her favorite doll.

23
00:05:32,217 --> 00:05:34,200
- What?
- You'll have to fix her.

24
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,127
I'll have to what?

25
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,967
- You'll have to fix her.
- I'll have to what?

26
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,763
You'll have...

27
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:43,118
That's all you worry about.
The kids.

28
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:48,788
I'll have to what? Would you look
at me when I'm talking to you?

29
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:50,421
Stop it!

30
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:55,503
Why don't you stop it?
Don't tell me what to do!

31
00:05:56,184 --> 00:05:58,071
- Stop it.
- You understand me?

32
00:05:58,647 --> 00:06:00,208
You understand what I'm saying?

33
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,437
Don't break my arm.

34
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:06,222
Don't tell me what to do!

35
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:18,158
Why do you make me
do this every fucking time?

36
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:27,916
What are we supposed to do now?

37
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:31,377
I'm out...

38
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:34,796
of wrapping paper.

39
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:43,469
It's okay.

40
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:46,156
Come on, it's okay.

41
00:06:55,383 --> 00:06:57,871
It's okay.
How are you doing?

42
00:06:58,103 --> 00:07:00,721
I want a Nintendo Wii
for Christmas, mom.

43
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:03,790
It's only a few hours
till Christmas.

44
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:07,063
- Can I get an American Girl doll?
- Guys.

45
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:08,973
You wrote your letters to Santa.

46
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:11,825
I don't think another letter
will make it to the North Pole.

47
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:17,079
- We're going to be okay?
- We're always okay.

48
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:19,573
We're always okay.

49
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:22,290
- No matter what happens.
- No matter what happens.

50
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:34,350
- I'll be back in a while, okay?
- Okay.

51
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:38,702
Now, promise me one thing.
Listen. You, you.

52
00:07:38,935 --> 00:07:40,534
You have to brush your teeth.

53
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:43,186
And I want you in the bed
after your treat, all right?

54
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,329
I'll see you later.

55
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,421
Mom!

56
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:53,136
I made a secret drawing for you.

57
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,626
- I love your drawings.
- Don't look at it yet!

58
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:01,649
Okay. I'll save it for later.
How about that?

59
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:04,021
Bye, sweetie.

60
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:44,917
And you can kiss my ass, Kenneth.

61
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:01,294
<i>Cellular 411 connect.
How may I direct your call?</i>

62
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:05,713

63
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:08,083

Meghan speaking.</i>

65
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,268
Hi, Meghan.
It's Della Myers.

66
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:18,707
<i>Hi.</i>

67
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,782
<i>Are you calling about Spanish?
It's been cancelled.</i>

68
00:11:21,816 --> 00:11:23,893
I knew about that.

69
00:11:23,927 --> 00:11:26,965
It's about next week's
mechanics class.

70
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:31,254
Would you pass on to Mike
that I won't be there this time?

71
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:33,040
<i>No problem.</i>

72
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:35,376
<i>- I'll make sure he gets that.
- Great.</i>

73
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,438
<i>- Hi. Della?
- What's up, Cassie?</i>

74
00:12:04,471 --> 00:12:08,375
<i>I'm over at the mall. What is
it we need to get for Pilates?</i>

75
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:12,263
One of those rubber bands.
I'm headed over there myself.

76
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:16,119
<i>Do yourself a favor. Turn around.
It's hell over here.</i>

77
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,646
My cell's dying.

78
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:19,475
You know... damn!

79
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:22,709
I left the charger
in the other car.

80
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:26,391
<i>Silly you. Let me pick you up
something. Save you the trip.</i>

81
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:28,147
<i>- I mean...
- Are you sure?</i>

82
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:30,157
No, it's okay.

83
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:34,646
Cassie, can we meet for a drink?

84
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,134
<i>You still there?
Your phone is breaking up.</i>

85
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:39,892
Damn.

86
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:51,540
You're kidding me.
My God!

87
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:11,893
Damn it!

88
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:13,428
Damn!

89
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:19,571
Come on.

90
00:13:20,118 --> 00:13:22,643
You think you're going
to take my spot, think again!

91
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,167
<i>I've been waiting
for 3o minutes! It's Christmas!</i>

92
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:31,479
Excuse me. Where can I find a
parking space? This is ridiculous!

93
00:13:31,513 --> 00:13:34,999
Ma'am, there is absolutely
nothing close by.

94
00:13:35,032 --> 00:13:36,854
Even the valet's backed up.

95
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:40,021
- You should try further out.
- Where? Over there?

96
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:42,319
Now, please keep moving.

97
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:44,974
Let's go.

98
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:46,804
Go!

99
00:13:58,711 --> 00:13:59,605
Come on!

100
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:02,509
Jerk!

101
00:14:03,287 --> 00:14:04,181
What a jerk!

102
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:18,836
Over there.

103
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:29,235
Smile.

104
00:16:29,846 --> 00:16:30,774
Good girl.

105
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:32,020
Merry Christmas!

106
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,846
- Would you like Chanel No. 5?
- No, thank you.

107
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:22,512
Can I help you with that?

108
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:27,029
I was just looking.
Thank you.

109
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:32,660
Hi.

110
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:34,957
Could I have a hot tea, please?

111
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,313
And one chocolate biscotti.

112
00:17:39,863 --> 00:17:41,772
Milk or dark chocolate?

113
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,078
No, just the tea.

114
00:17:45,112 --> 00:17:45,972
Name?

115
00:17:47,158 --> 00:17:48,371
Della.

116
00:17:48,404 --> 00:17:49,584
Two "L"s.

117
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,841
US$2.65.

118
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:04,820
Thank you.

119
00:18:18,294 --> 00:18:19,277
Della?

120
00:18:19,671 --> 00:18:20,565
Is that you?

121
00:18:21,718 --> 00:18:23,791
Lynn? Lynn Monroe.

122
00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:27,281
- Hi.
- I haven't seen you since college!

123
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:28,973
Right.

124
00:18:29,302 --> 00:18:32,564
You married that handsome jock
and we never heard from you again.

125
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,526
You live around here?

126
00:18:36,855 --> 00:18:39,927
We just bought this divine house
in Pleasant Valley. You know it?

127
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,493
Yes, I do.

128
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:44,308
It's perfect for the kids.
They practically walk to school.

129
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,293
We've got a great backyard.

130
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,733
We're thinking
of putting a pool in it.

131
00:18:48,758 --> 00:18:49,806
They'll love that!

132
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:52,626
Enough of me.
How are you?

133
00:18:53,942 --> 00:18:54,836
Fine.

134
00:18:55,158 --> 00:18:58,671
I have two children,
Terry and Tammi. Twins.

135
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,310
We're celebrating tonight.
David's been promoted.

136
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,863
I had to buy this gorgeous
black teddy.

137
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,212
It is. It's gorgeous.

138
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:14,893
- It's been nice talking to you.
- You too.

139
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:16,719
I've got to get my hair done.

140
00:19:18,262 --> 00:19:19,190
See you later.

141
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,693
See you.

142
00:19:24,374 --> 00:19:24,974
Mitch!

143
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:26,580
How are you?

144
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:14,924
- Which one would you like?
- That one.

145
00:20:15,542 --> 00:20:16,436
That one?

146
00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:18,356
This one?

147
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:21,997
That's the one?

148
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:25,046
- Thanks.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

149
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,126
Merry Christmas!

150
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:32,082
Hello.

151
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:42,101
US$21.69, please.

152
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:45,104
- There you go.
- Thank you.

153
00:20:50,391 --> 00:20:52,245
I'm sorry.
It's been declined.

154
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:54,036
Do you have another card?

155
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,918
No, I don't.

156
00:21:01,942 --> 00:21:02,738
Seventeen...

157
00:21:04,278 --> 00:21:05,456
twenty-one...

158
00:21:08,662 --> 00:21:09,294
There.

159
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:13,398
<i>It's Christmas Eve,
and the mall is now closed.</i>

160
00:21:13,432 --> 00:21:14,805
<i>Happy Holidays, everyone.</i>

161
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:27,250
<i>This day is borne a Savior
Of a pure, virgin bride</i>

162
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:33,072
<i>To free all who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might</i>

163
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:38,293
<i>Oh, tidings of comfort and joy</i>

164
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:43,284
<i>Oh, tidings</i>

165
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:48,686
<i>Of comfort and joy</i>

166
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,481
Shit.

167
00:22:20,246 --> 00:22:22,385
Shit. What now?

168
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:27,188
Excuse me?

169
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,197
I've got a gun.

170
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:32,526
How's about I aim it
at your pussy?

171
00:22:38,582 --> 00:22:40,404
Why don't you back your car up?

172
00:22:40,822 --> 00:22:42,196
That's not going to happen.

173
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:46,321
What are you doing?
I don't know this game.

174
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:48,085
Trust me, it's not a game.

175
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:51,573
How about you shut up,
and eat a dick?

176
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:54,710
When you get done, we're going
to staple your mouth shut.

177
00:22:54,744 --> 00:22:55,637
Right, Chuckie?

178
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:01,715
"Chuckie"? Is that for real?

179
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:04,590
At least your parents
have a sense of humor.

180
00:23:05,046 --> 00:23:06,678
I don't have any parents.

181
00:23:06,711 --> 00:23:07,823
I named myself.

182
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:10,549
Do you have a beef
with us, honey?

183
00:23:10,582 --> 00:23:13,537
Because slipping a note
underneath my wipers...

184
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,493
is an invitation to war
to me and my soldiers.

185
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:19,190
If you hadn't have parked
like an asshole...

186
00:23:19,224 --> 00:23:20,852
we wouldn't be standing here.

187
00:23:20,886 --> 00:23:22,708
- Watch your mouth!
- Get away from me!

188
00:23:23,094 --> 00:23:25,199
You're just digging
your grave deeper.

189
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:29,010
- Where you going?
- Fuck you!

190
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:31,502
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you!

191
00:23:31,831 --> 00:23:33,205
Any trouble here, ma'am?

192
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,671
Not if these punks
move their car!

193
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:37,197
What's the deal, Barney Fife?

194
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:41,104
Okay, boys. Back your car up
and let the lady out.

195
00:23:41,783 --> 00:23:42,960
How does that sound, squirt?

196
00:23:44,054 --> 00:23:46,738
We're not in the mood.
In fact...

197
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:51,214
mind your fucking business,
and go direct some traffic.

198
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:53,650
I'm going to make
this my business.

199
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:57,974
Now, why don't you pile back
into your piece-of-shit car...

200
00:23:58,008 --> 00:23:59,763
and get the fuck out of my mall?

201
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:02,418
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear me?

202
00:24:04,054 --> 00:24:05,894
Did you hear me, daddy?
Get out of here!

203
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:07,701
- Put the gun down.
- Get out of here!

204
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:10,257
- Put the gun down!
- I said, get out of here!

205
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,782
- Put the gun down!
- You want me to put it down?

206
00:24:13,526 --> 00:24:15,020
Make me, bitch!
I said...

207
00:24:22,934 --> 00:24:24,494
- Shit.
- Motherfucker.

208
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,458
She's getting away!

209
00:24:40,086 --> 00:24:43,733
<i>Fuck, man! She's probably
on the phone with 5-o already!</i>

210
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:48,470
- We're going to go down for this!
- Don't worry about it, nigga.

211
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:52,267
Don't call me "nigga".
You ain't the right. None of you.

212
00:24:53,046 --> 00:24:54,420
Take it easy, Huey.

213
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:56,309
Take it easy.
We got this.

214
00:24:56,534 --> 00:24:58,678
The world is our bitch.
Get in the car.

215
00:24:58,712 --> 00:24:59,540
Now.

216
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,710
Move over, Tomas!
Come on!

217
00:25:01,974 --> 00:25:04,756
- The cop went down hard.
- Goddamn it, Tomas. Shut up!

218
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:50,676
My God.

219
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,564
Oh, God.

220
00:28:16,406 --> 00:28:17,420
Hell, no.

221
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:21,428
- Damn!
- What?

222
00:28:21,462 --> 00:28:23,469
My new Keds are all dirty!

223
00:28:33,142 --> 00:28:34,516
Get there and push!

224
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,135
The car's got nowhere to go.
The road ends there.

225
00:28:38,006 --> 00:28:40,177
There's nothing
but houses and trees.

226
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,866
Ditch the car, man.

227
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,531
We've got a witness on the loose.

228
00:28:46,326 --> 00:28:47,444
Trust me.

229
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:51,853
You won't hear a peep from her.
She's going down, execution style.

230
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,587
What if she's gone already?

231
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,026
She's not gone.

232
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,204
There's no place for her to go.

233
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,179
<i>Damn. She took out that barrier.</i>

234
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:15,307
<i>It's going to be impossible to
find her, even if she is around.</i>

235
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:17,932
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

236
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,524
Maybe we can hotwire the truck.

237
00:29:50,646 --> 00:29:52,500
I'll find you now, cunt!

238
00:29:59,286 --> 00:30:02,035
We caught up in this
like it's a soap opera.

239
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:06,122
We need to blast out of town,
act like we were never around.

240
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,302
- Vingh, get over here.
- How much "Kill" you been smoking?

241
00:30:09,335 --> 00:30:12,038
Come on, man. No one cares
about a fucking Rent-A-Pig!

242
00:30:12,072 --> 00:30:14,741
He's just collateral damage
to the people at the mall.

243
00:30:14,775 --> 00:30:16,340
She's the only witness!

244
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:18,388
If we hit the road right now...

245
00:30:18,421 --> 00:30:20,820
w could be miles away
before they find out.

246
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:24,149
We could be swimming in the
Atlantic, like you promised me.

247
00:30:26,294 --> 00:30:27,221
Huey, come here.

248
00:30:28,854 --> 00:30:29,748
Come here.

249
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,734
Remember how I broke
you out of that home?

250
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,741
I was there for you, right?

251
00:30:39,189 --> 00:30:40,618
You trust me, right?

252
00:30:41,461 --> 00:30:42,443
Right?

253
00:30:44,982 --> 00:30:48,430
All we got to do is find her,
and we're out of here. I promise.

254
00:30:48,662 --> 00:30:49,556
That's it.

255
00:30:49,942 --> 00:30:50,989
There's her Ford!

256
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:06,646
Somebody tell her mom
to lay out her black dress.

257
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:08,116
Why? Is she dead?

258
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:09,813
No, she went through her trunk.

259
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:10,544
She's here.

260
00:31:11,318 --> 00:31:12,528
She's hiding somewhere.

261
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:16,877
She left her purse.
It's all in here. Her cell phone.

262
00:31:17,654 --> 00:31:18,864
<i>Where are you?</i>

263
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:21,843
<i>- Her battery gave out.
- We're going to find you!</i>

264
00:31:23,701 --> 00:31:24,367
There she is!

265
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,346
Go that way! That way!

266
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:49,107
Fuck!

267
00:31:51,158 --> 00:31:52,980
- You see her down there?
- No, man.

268
00:31:54,358 --> 00:31:56,846
- She must have gone around.
- She vanished.

269
00:31:57,813 --> 00:31:59,308
Check each one of these houses.

270
00:32:01,078 --> 00:32:03,053
Split up. Spread out!

271
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:20,714
Della!

272
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:29,427
We know who you are!

273
00:32:30,645 --> 00:32:32,139
You can't hide, honey.

274
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,387
We're not going to give up
till we find you.

275
00:32:58,805 --> 00:33:00,180
You're trapped, Della.

276
00:33:03,926 --> 00:33:05,387
We're going to find you!

277
00:33:18,965 --> 00:33:20,875
Where's Little Red Riding Hood?

278
00:33:32,438 --> 00:33:34,740
Where was that?
Check the house next door!

279
00:33:35,254 --> 00:33:36,148
Move it!

280
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:34,740
There she is!

281
00:34:35,382 --> 00:34:37,803
- We got you.
- You're dead, bitch.

282
00:34:38,614 --> 00:34:39,442
Time to say goodbye.

283
00:34:43,158 --> 00:34:45,230
You hear that?
Do you hear that?

284
00:34:46,038 --> 00:34:48,972
It's the sound of the waves!
Sounds good, right?

285
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:52,081
Yeah, Chuckie.
It sounds great.

286
00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:58,067
Don't worry.

287
00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:01,810
When we're done with you,
we'll send you back to mister...

288
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:06,550
You want play nice?
You want to play?

289
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,306
Back off! Hold back!

290
00:35:09,045 --> 00:35:10,092
Give me a minute.

291
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:16,179
I'm sorry about that.

292
00:35:17,813 --> 00:35:18,893
I'm sorry.

293
00:35:20,502 --> 00:35:21,450
You okay?

294
00:35:23,445 --> 00:35:24,339
Chill out.

295
00:35:24,725 --> 00:35:25,870
You all right?

296
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:27,693
Settle down!

297
00:35:28,373 --> 00:35:29,356
Settle down!

298
00:35:30,645 --> 00:35:32,555
You all right? Settle down.

299
00:35:33,494 --> 00:35:35,501
You know how we know your name?

300
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:40,395
You messed up, Della.
You left your purse in the car.

301
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:42,160
Give me that.

302
00:35:48,758 --> 00:35:50,700
Your photo
doesn't do you justice.

303
00:35:51,509 --> 00:35:52,437
He is right.

304
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:55,661
- You look better in person.
- You do.

305
00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:57,802
You look good.

306
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:02,861
You're not going
to need it anymore.

307
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:17,679
What's in that box, Della?

308
00:36:20,982 --> 00:36:22,323
What's in the box?

309
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,236
What's in the box, girl?

310
00:36:25,782 --> 00:36:28,596
What's up? You think
she's carrying some cash?

311
00:36:29,301 --> 00:36:30,730
Some jewelry or something?

312
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:32,532
I don't know.

313
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,507
I don't know.

314
00:36:36,117 --> 00:36:38,157
Maybe she cashed in
her life savings.

315
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:40,559
Plan on running away?

316
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:42,866
Start a new life?

317
00:36:43,189 --> 00:36:44,399
That is it, Della?

318
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,801
You got enough scratch
to buy us off?

319
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:49,005
Open the box.

320
00:36:49,557 --> 00:36:50,637
Open the box!

321
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:53,076
- Open it!
- Okay.

322
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:55,603
Take the box. We're going
to kill her anyway.

323
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:58,894
I'll open the box.

324
00:37:06,229 --> 00:37:07,439
You know what?

325
00:37:08,565 --> 00:37:09,940
She ain't got nothing.

326
00:37:10,997 --> 00:37:12,753
Let's take that pussy
and get going.

327
00:37:16,597 --> 00:37:17,491
I got her!

328
00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:19,692
Down there!

329
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:20,947
Look out, Huey!

330
00:37:26,197 --> 00:37:28,101
- What the fuck, niggas?
- Shut up!

331
00:37:28,135 --> 00:37:30,005
- Are you hurt?
- I said, shut up!

332
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,434
And don't use the N-word.

333
00:37:33,238 --> 00:37:34,764
You ain't representing.

334
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,235
Huey?

335
00:37:42,773 --> 00:37:44,628
- What did you do?
- What do you mean?

336
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,480
<i>Stop fucking around.</i>

337
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:51,339
Huey?

338
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:56,208
- What's up, little brother?
- Spare me, God.

339
00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:57,875
Quit fucking around.

340
00:37:58,773 --> 00:37:59,667
Huey?

341
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:11,818
What's up?

342
00:38:15,221 --> 00:38:16,115
Fuck!

343
00:38:17,685 --> 00:38:18,449
Fuck!

344
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:25,843
Come on, man.

345
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:28,373
What the fuck did you do?
Get off him!

346
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,267
I didn't kill him.

347
00:38:29,749 --> 00:38:33,098
- You stepped on his face!
- Don't touch me!

348
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:36,235
- I didn't kill him! She did.
- Get the fuck off!

349
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:40,560
God! Huey!

350
00:38:41,781 --> 00:38:44,465
- I'm going to get that bitch!
- You let her go!

351
00:38:45,238 --> 00:38:46,994
You piece of shit!
Where the fuck is she?

352
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:02,867
Fuck.

353
00:39:57,365 --> 00:39:58,739
<i>Della!</i>

354
00:40:01,653 --> 00:40:03,147
<i>Della!</i>

355
00:40:13,718 --> 00:40:14,928
<i>Della!</i>

356
00:42:56,597 --> 00:43:00,771
<i>I guess you are right
When we talked in the heat</i>

357
00:43:00,804 --> 00:43:04,946
<i>There's no room for the weak
No room for the weak</i>

358
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:09,455
<i>Where will it end?</i>

359
00:43:10,325 --> 00:43:12,016
<i>Where will it end?</i>

360
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:16,306
<i>Where will it end?</i>

361
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,534
<i>Where will it end?</i>

362
00:43:36,597 --> 00:43:39,466
<i>This is the room
The start of it all</i>

363
00:43:40,053 --> 00:43:43,731
<i>They're talking to you
I remember it all</i>

364
00:43:43,765 --> 00:43:47,184
<i>I've seen the night
Filled with blood and pain</i>

365
00:43:47,217 --> 00:43:50,604
<i>And the bodies obtained
And the bodies obtained</i>

366
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:52,624
<i>And the bodies obtained</i>

367
00:43:55,732 --> 00:43:56,780
What are you doing?

368
00:44:01,653 --> 00:44:02,546
It's a tribute.

369
00:44:03,221 --> 00:44:04,235
A gesture.

370
00:44:06,421 --> 00:44:08,592
<i>Where will it end?</i>

371
00:44:09,301 --> 00:44:11,952
That'll wake up every
cop in Podunk county!

372
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:15,955
It's for him.

373
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,671
It's for Huey.

374
00:44:46,612 --> 00:44:48,107
I didn't mean it, Huey.

375
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:51,691
What did you say?

376
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:54,963
What?

377
00:44:55,669 --> 00:44:57,392
I didn't mean to kill him.

378
00:44:58,069 --> 00:45:00,819
Get away from him.
Get the fuck away from him!

379
00:45:03,188 --> 00:45:04,617
Get the fuck away from him!

380
00:45:05,909 --> 00:45:09,357
Get away from him!
Get away! Get away!

381
00:45:10,197 --> 00:45:12,052
- Get away!
- Fuck you!

382
00:45:15,957 --> 00:45:17,331
<i>I'm going to get you!</i>

383
00:45:18,196 --> 00:45:19,342
Do you hear me, Della?

384
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:21,230
I'm going to get you!

385
00:45:52,725 --> 00:45:53,553
God.

386
00:46:09,365 --> 00:46:11,536
MOMMY WE LOVE YOU

387
00:46:37,653 --> 00:46:38,547
<i>Della!</i>

388
00:46:53,301 --> 00:46:54,511
<i>Della?</i>

389
00:47:14,485 --> 00:47:15,379
Wait.

390
00:47:16,949 --> 00:47:17,842
It's "Bulgari".

391
00:47:18,548 --> 00:47:21,265
- What's "Bulgari"?
- It's a perfume, dude.

392
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:24,010
It smells more
like that No. 5 shit.

393
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,442
- "Chanel".
- No, it's "Bulgari".

394
00:47:27,796 --> 00:47:29,323
My dad's bitch bathes in it.

395
00:47:49,972 --> 00:47:50,866
It's blood.

396
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:56,971
It's her blood.

397
00:47:57,493 --> 00:47:58,606
Maybe she's hurt.

398
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:09,866
This way.

399
00:48:15,253 --> 00:48:17,009
Go, go, go!

400
00:48:24,532 --> 00:48:25,645
<i>Watch out, dude.</i>

401
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:29,203
<i>Look out!</i>

402
00:48:33,141 --> 00:48:34,034
Damn!

403
00:48:47,861 --> 00:48:49,807
- Shit!
- What happened?

404
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,754
I stepped in the stream!

405
00:48:58,069 --> 00:49:00,938
- That was raw.
- Who cares, man?

406
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:03,441
Nobody gives a shit
if we live or die.

407
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:07,605
Quit playing with the flashlight.
We are stumbling in the dark!

408
00:49:07,638 --> 00:49:09,776
He who finds it, shines it.

409
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:12,589
- Let's go!
- Where the hell is she?

410
00:49:13,077 --> 00:49:15,052
- Shut up and move it!
- Damn!

411
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:17,745
Let's go, guys.

412
00:49:18,517 --> 00:49:19,499
There she is!

413
00:49:32,404 --> 00:49:33,648
Don't let her get away!

414
00:49:38,293 --> 00:49:39,122
Huey?

415
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:40,907
Is that you, Huey?

416
00:49:41,621 --> 00:49:43,312
I saw him there in those trees!

417
00:49:51,637 --> 00:49:52,531
Sure you did.

418
00:50:03,476 --> 00:50:05,037
Son of a bitch!

419
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:10,164
I'm going to get you, bitch!

420
00:50:24,436 --> 00:50:25,516
You will see!

421
00:50:26,741 --> 00:50:27,985
You fucking bitch!

422
00:50:31,476 --> 00:50:32,753
Son of a bitch!

423
00:50:59,508 --> 00:51:01,002
Time's up, you bitch.

424
00:51:14,485 --> 00:51:15,378
God!

425
00:51:55,573 --> 00:51:56,467
Tomas!

426
00:51:58,293 --> 00:51:59,186
Quiet.

427
00:52:05,717 --> 00:52:07,310
Tomas is gone.

428
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,162
I can feel it.

429
00:52:11,572 --> 00:52:13,744
He's probably got her
strung up by now.

430
00:52:15,637 --> 00:52:17,066
There's something over here.

431
00:52:18,484 --> 00:52:19,466
Looks like a body.

432
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,394
It's a tree stump,
you dumb wonton.

433
00:52:57,428 --> 00:52:58,322
Tomas...

434
00:53:10,676 --> 00:53:12,400
She's going to kill us too.

435
00:53:12,948 --> 00:53:14,377
We're all going to die here.

436
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:20,563
No gun can kill
a spirit gone bad.

437
00:53:21,236 --> 00:53:23,691
She's gone bad.
She's gone bad.

438
00:53:25,557 --> 00:53:26,450
Gone bad.

439
00:53:29,653 --> 00:53:31,179
I'm going to get this girl.

440
00:53:40,276 --> 00:53:41,486
I'm sorry.

441
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:45,297
I'm so sorry.

442
00:53:56,437 --> 00:54:00,299
Where are you, God?
Where are you?

443
00:54:01,524 --> 00:54:04,524
All I want to do
is see my babies!

444
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:11,309
Where are you?
Where are you?

445
00:54:21,972 --> 00:54:22,900
Fuck.

446
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:25,803
Fuck, fuck!

447
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,049
Over there, Chuckie!

448
00:55:16,084 --> 00:55:17,066
You're going down!

449
00:55:24,628 --> 00:55:25,610
Slow down, bitch.

450
00:55:27,956 --> 00:55:30,476
- Fuck.
- Get of my way, Vingh!

451
00:55:32,468 --> 00:55:33,483
Get up!

452
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:37,709
Get up! She's taking off!

453
00:56:06,228 --> 00:56:09,294
I don't feel good, Chuckie.
I got hypothermia.

454
00:56:09,844 --> 00:56:10,924
You'll be fine.

455
00:56:11,797 --> 00:56:13,902
It ain't natural how
she gets away every time.

456
00:56:15,764 --> 00:56:17,008
Let's get this over with.

457
00:56:17,716 --> 00:56:19,985
You go up there.
I'll cover you.

458
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:23,181
I ain't going there without
the gun. End of story.

459
00:56:24,596 --> 00:56:26,287
I never pegged you for a pussy.

460
00:56:27,476 --> 00:56:30,964
Even when Tomas called it,
I always defended you.

461
00:56:30,998 --> 00:56:32,491
<i>No one ever called me a pussy.</i>

462
00:56:32,884 --> 00:56:36,628
<i>She couldn't weight more than 12o.
You could break her in half</i>

463
00:56:36,662 --> 00:56:39,563
- Tomas never called me a pussy!
- Fine.

464
00:56:40,404 --> 00:56:42,194
You don't want to go? Don't go.

465
00:56:42,228 --> 00:56:45,774
I'm going to get this bitch
for Tomas. For Huey.

466
00:57:02,644 --> 00:57:03,538
You go up.

467
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:05,617
I'm going to go around the side.

468
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,346
No limits on power.

469
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,595
No limits on power!

470
00:58:38,164 --> 00:58:39,212
<i>Vingh?</i>

471
01:00:13,748 --> 01:00:14,730
Della?

472
01:00:25,843 --> 01:00:27,218
Della?

473
01:00:47,508 --> 01:00:49,363
<i>It's just you and me left now.</i>

474
01:00:53,268 --> 01:00:55,602
I saw a trail
of your blood back there.

475
01:00:58,356 --> 01:00:59,763
You must be hurt.

476
01:01:08,148 --> 01:01:09,358
I'm hurting, too.

477
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,227
<i>You busted my collarbone.</i>

478
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,154
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

479
01:01:20,308 --> 01:01:21,869
I can smell your sweat.

480
01:01:29,236 --> 01:01:30,414
I can smell your blood.

481
01:01:35,732 --> 01:01:37,106
I know you're close.

482
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,984
After what went down tonight,
we got a special bond.

483
01:01:54,804 --> 01:01:56,659
You may come out now.

484
01:02:02,164 --> 01:02:03,309
<i>Want a cigarette?</i>

485
01:02:05,876 --> 01:02:08,494
<i>I'll save one for you,
for when you decide to come out.</i>

486
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:15,218
<i>You are one tough bitch!</i>

487
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,064
And that is hot.

488
01:02:31,892 --> 01:02:35,820
They are really cute.
Twins, huh?

489
01:02:37,523 --> 01:02:40,174
<i>A woman's purse can
tell her whole life story.</i>

490
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:47,598
Are you sure you don't want
a cigarette now? Della?

491
01:02:49,428 --> 01:02:50,322
Honey?

492
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:55,914
Now I know where they live.
Maybe I'll stop by and say hi.

493
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,107
I figured that'd help
to find your voice.

494
01:03:06,452 --> 01:03:07,630
Don't worry.

495
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,616
I wouldn't hurt them.

496
01:03:11,508 --> 01:03:13,483
It's wrong to hurt kids, right?

497
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:16,754
The game's over, Della.

498
01:03:19,251 --> 01:03:20,145
You won.

499
01:03:44,148 --> 01:03:45,522
You took him from me, Della.

500
01:03:47,988 --> 01:03:49,515
He was like my little brother.

501
01:03:57,396 --> 01:03:59,600
All he wanted to do
was see the ocean.

502
01:04:02,036 --> 01:04:03,596
But he never got to see it.

503
01:04:07,796 --> 01:04:09,225
No, he never got to go.

504
01:04:14,004 --> 01:04:15,433
They're all gone now.

505
01:04:29,843 --> 01:04:31,054
Let's see here.

506
01:04:32,788 --> 01:04:34,217
Monday, Pilates.

507
01:04:35,796 --> 01:04:37,454
Tuesday, Spanish.

508
01:04:39,028 --> 01:04:41,330
Wednesday, Mechanics?

509
01:04:45,972 --> 01:04:48,492
Thursday, Friday...

510
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:52,816
Face it, Della.

511
01:04:54,484 --> 01:04:56,623
You're no suburban housewife.

512
01:05:01,492 --> 01:05:03,280
You bought into the big lie.

513
01:05:05,684 --> 01:05:06,861
You even tried to live it.

514
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:10,801
Husband...

515
01:05:11,827 --> 01:05:12,721
house...

516
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:14,514
security...

517
01:05:15,956 --> 01:05:17,298
every woman's dream.

518
01:05:21,331 --> 01:05:22,542
But not yours.

519
01:05:25,011 --> 01:05:27,116
You know there's no
such thing as security.

520
01:05:37,716 --> 01:05:40,236
I reckon I know what
you've been dreaming about.

521
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,471
What you've been aching for...

522
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:45,839
all these lonely years.

523
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:49,553
The wind in your hair.

524
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:52,594
The dirt of life
between your fingers.

525
01:05:54,516 --> 01:05:56,371
Taking what you want from life.

526
01:05:58,675 --> 01:05:59,624
Right, Della?

527
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:04,074
Don't tell me you
haven't thought about it.

528
01:06:06,388 --> 01:06:07,598
It's in your blood.

529
01:06:10,068 --> 01:06:12,370
I bet your husband
doesn't treat you right.

530
01:06:14,643 --> 01:06:15,953
Takes you for granted.

531
01:06:20,308 --> 01:06:21,966
You can't go back to that.

532
01:06:24,499 --> 01:06:25,994
You don't want
to go back to that.

533
01:06:29,939 --> 01:06:31,630
Let's go pick up your kids.

534
01:06:33,204 --> 01:06:34,098
Right now.

535
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,153
And we'll get rid of him.

536
01:06:39,156 --> 01:06:40,562
You can do it.

537
01:06:42,196 --> 01:06:43,472
I can do it.

538
01:06:54,996 --> 01:06:55,890
It's okay.

539
01:07:17,331 --> 01:07:18,225
Come here.

540
01:07:34,867 --> 01:07:36,012
Hell of a night, huh?

541
01:07:56,243 --> 01:07:57,258
Close your eyes.

542
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:00,747
Close your eyes.

543
01:08:07,284 --> 01:08:08,593
You're amazing, Della.

544
01:08:13,075 --> 01:08:14,057
So beautiful.

545
01:09:09,332 --> 01:09:10,957
You've been a bad girl.

546
01:09:22,739 --> 01:09:23,884
You're a bad girl.

547
01:09:28,436 --> 01:09:29,330
Fuck me.

548
01:09:31,635 --> 01:09:32,529
Fuck me.

549
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:56,175
<i>You can count on me</i>

550
01:15:01,235 --> 01:15:06,156
<i>Please have snow and mistletoe</i>

551
01:15:06,451 --> 01:15:11,470
<i>And presents under the tree</i>

552
01:15:17,395 --> 01:15:22,763
<i>Christmas Eve will find me</i>

553
01:15:26,131 --> 01:15:30,670
<i>Where the love light gleams</i>

554
01:15:32,307 --> 01:15:40,075
<i>I'll be home for Christmas</i>

555
01:15:41,651 --> 01:15:47,499
<i>If only in my</i>

556
01:15:49,043 --> 01:15:50,734
<i>Dreams</i>

557
01:15:56,851 --> 01:15:59,534
<i>You want to tell me where
you've been all night, honey?</i>

558
01:16:00,499 --> 01:16:02,059
Don't ever call me that again.

559
01:16:02,643 --> 01:16:03,505
What?

560
01:16:06,131 --> 01:16:09,066
<i>You can't even take
your shoes off at the door?</i>

561
01:16:09,811 --> 01:16:11,120
<i>The Japanese do it!</i>

562
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:13,073
<i>I do it.</i>

563
01:16:50,931 --> 01:16:53,003
I see you got the paper.
What'd you get me?

564
01:17:01,331 --> 01:17:03,022
What did you get me at the mall?

565
01:17:06,707 --> 01:17:07,754
Nothing.

566
01:17:08,915 --> 01:17:12,744
<i>In every dream home
A heartache</i>

567
01:17:14,227 --> 01:17:16,561
<i>And every step I take</i>

568
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:21,168
<i>Takes me further from heaven</i>

569
01:17:25,203 --> 01:17:27,113
<i>Is there a heaven?</i>

570
01:17:29,715 --> 01:17:32,049
<i>I'd like to think so</i>

571
01:17:36,339 --> 01:17:38,575
<i>Standards of living</i>

572
01:17:40,755 --> 01:17:42,926
<i>They're rising daily</i>

573
01:17:44,915 --> 01:17:47,730
<i>But home, oh, sweet home</i>

574
01:17:49,555 --> 01:17:51,694
<i>It's only a saying</i>

575
01:17:53,843 --> 01:17:56,942
<i>From bell-push to faucet</i>

576
01:17:58,419 --> 01:18:01,582
<i>In smart-town apartments</i>

577
01:18:02,995 --> 01:18:05,297
<i>The cottage is pretty</i>

578
01:18:07,411 --> 01:18:10,258
<i>The main house a palace</i>

579
01:18:12,275 --> 01:18:17,171
<i>Penthouse perfection
But what goes on?</i>

580
01:18:17,204 --> 01:18:19,178
<i>What to do there?</i>

581
01:18:19,411 --> 01:18:21,713
<i>Better pray there</i>

582
01:18:30,483 --> 01:18:32,752
<i>Open-plan living</i>

583
01:18:34,963 --> 01:18:37,680
<i>Bungalow ranch-style</i>

584
01:18:39,251 --> 01:18:42,065
<i>All of its comforts</i>

585
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:46,251
<i>Seem so essential</i>

586
01:18:48,051 --> 01:18:50,669
<i>I bought you mail order</i>

587
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:55,370
<i>My plain-wrapper baby</i>

588
01:18:56,883 --> 01:18:59,272
<i>Your skin is like vinyl</i>

589
01:19:01,139 --> 01:19:03,506
<i>The perfect companion</i>

590
01:19:05,619 --> 01:19:08,433
<i>You float in my new pool</i>

591
01:19:10,355 --> 01:19:12,941
<i>Deluxe and delightful</i>

592
01:19:14,579 --> 01:19:17,296
<i>Inflatable doll</i>

593
01:19:19,219 --> 01:19:21,772
<i>My role is to serve you</i>

594
01:19:23,379 --> 01:19:26,194
<i>Disposable darling</i>

595
01:19:28,051 --> 01:19:30,603
<i>Can't throw you away now</i>

596
01:19:32,338 --> 01:19:35,437
<i>Immortal and life-size</i>

597
01:19:36,723 --> 01:19:39,505
<i>My breath is inside you</i>

598
01:19:41,299 --> 01:19:43,754
<i>I'll dress you up daily</i>

599
01:19:45,907 --> 01:19:48,874
<i>And keep you till death sighs</i>

600
01:19:50,226 --> 01:19:52,714
<i>Inflatable doll</i>

601
01:19:54,995 --> 01:19:57,166
<i>Lover ungrateful</i>

602
01:19:59,283 --> 01:20:01,966
<i>I blew up your body</i>

603
01:20:05,555 --> 01:20:07,410
<i>But you blew my mind</i>

604
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:27,723
<i>Oh, honey</i>

605
01:20:31,635 --> 01:20:34,734
<i>Dream home heartaches</i>

606
01:20:38,482 --> 01:20:40,970
<i>Oh, honey</i>

607
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:47,693
<i>Dream home heartaches</i>

608
01:20:51,987 --> 01:20:54,092
<i>Oh, honey</i>

609
01:20:58,323 --> 01:21:00,974
<i>Dream home heartaches</i>
