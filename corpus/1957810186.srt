0
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,073
And you're sure you
wanna tell me your story?

1
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:33,991
Yeah.

2
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:36,618
Okay.

3
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,245
State your name.

4
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,540
Tristan Harris.

5
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,429
Where do you want me to start?

6
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,181
I couldn't say.

7
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,183
It's not my story.

8
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,027
Ahhhh.

9
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,738
Oh, god, the quality.

10
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,701
Vinyl, it's so much
better, don't you think?

11
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,162
You know, they should put
record players in machines,

12
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:46,833
uh, cars, nowadays it's all
about the digital.

13
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:51,462
With their iPods, the
cellphones with the Bluetooth.

14
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,547
Just listen.

15
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,841
Listen.

16
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,634
Open up your heart,
chappy, and listen.

17
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,637
There's just so much more
authenticity to vinyl.

18
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:04,142
Not to mention the joy that
you get from going to the store

19
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,811
and purchasing a
physical vinyl record

20
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,480
to take home and play.

21
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,941
There's nothing
compares to that.

22
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,359
I much more prefer that.

23
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:17,530
I don't understand why more
people don't prefer that.

24
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:21,284
What else I don't
understand is all these

25
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,995
different interrogation
techniques.

26
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,374
You've got good cop, bad cop.

27
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,211
Dismemberment, torture.

28
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:35,715
Too much work, it's like the
expression you Americans say.

29
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:39,761
To go around your zoopa to
get your elbow.

30
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,178
I could torture you in more ways

31
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,180
than you can pray
against, chappy.

32
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,016
But I don't want to get
blood on this shirt.

33
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,729
My mother gave it to me,
she would kill me.

34
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,190
But you know what
I find, chappy?

35
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,108
I have alternative method.

36
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,860
The key, chappy, is family.

37
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:01,241
If I get your father,
your daughter, your son,

38
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,119
your mother, or your wife,

39
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,873
then, chappy, then you'd
tell me what I want to know.

40
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,292
Would you like to test
this theory, chappy?

41
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,088
You don't believe
me, let's find out.

42
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,251
Time to spill your guts, chappy.

43
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,296
All right, I'll give
you what you want!

44
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,798
See, chappy?

45
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,842
I rest my case.

46
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,371
I have the information.

47
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,666
The chaplain.

48
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,129
Dah, he is naive.

49
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,257
Dah, dah.

50
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,634
Get them out of
Witness Protection,

51
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,137
and Tristan will come to you.

52
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,471
Tristan.

53
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,307
The man who defied his god in
order to save his daughter.

54
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,685
Look out for him, man.

55
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,355
This is a true gangster.

56
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,941
An outlaw.

57
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,869
Where's my wife and daughter?

58
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,815
Where's my wife and daughter?

59
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,403
My apologies.

60
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,837
Where's my wife and daughter?

61
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,132
Straight to business.

62
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,759
I can respect that.

63
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,096
Your respect isn't worth
the bullet to kill it.

64
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,150
You are an example man.

65
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,321
You learn by
example, do you not?

66
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,615
Depends on what I'm
trying to learn exactly.

67
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,623
Exactly who you
are dealing with.

68
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,076
We were missing you today.

69
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,661
We made a poster.

70
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,413
I love it.

71
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,501
We all really miss you, so we

72
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,378
really want you to come back.

73
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,797
Tell
everybody I miss them, too.

74
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,798
We will.

75
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,468
Bye.

76
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,327
Did you sleep okay last night?

77
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,163
Good, how's your headache?

78
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,375
It feels better
than it did yesterday.

79
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,379
Good, can you open your
eyes and follow my finger?

80
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,674
Does the light hurt
your eyes today?

81
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,551
- Yeah.
- Okay.

82
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,678
Let's take a listen.

83
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,684
Okay, deep breath.

84
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,687
Good, does that hurt?

85
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,440
- Mm-mm.
- Good.

86
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,525
Okay, can you sit up for me?

87
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,527
All right.

88
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,195
Good deep breaths.

89
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,031
Good.

90
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,121
Covered back up here.

91
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,542
Hi.
Hey.

92
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,877
Have y'all heard
any results yet?

93
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,878
We have, why don't
we talk in the hall?

94
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,214
She's kinda tired, you
get some sleep, okay?

95
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,633
I'll be right back.

96
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,224
You know we've done
a variety of tests

97
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,435
over the last few days and
the last test that we did

98
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,437
was a CAT scan of her
brain and it shows that

99
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,732
she has a brain tumor
called a glioblastoma.

100
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,276
It's rare in children,

101
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,737
but it is a fairly
aggressive form of cancer.

102
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,620
So we're gonna have to do
surgery or how do you fix this?

103
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,370
She'll need surgery
as soon as possible.

104
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,207
That's her best
chance for survival.

105
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,221
You know...

106
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,433
I never thought any
of this was possible.

107
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,606
That this could happen
to us, to Maggie.

108
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,443
She's 10 years old.

109
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,446
10.

110
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,826
She's got her whole
life left to live.

111
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,957
I just don't
understand any of it.

112
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:00,964
Any of it, and I know that
we're not the only parents

113
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,467
that this will happen to,
but it's so different.

114
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,554
When it's your kid.

115
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,518
And I wanna have faith.

116
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,187
I really do.

117
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,863
And I'm tryin' to be
so strong for you.

118
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,951
And for Maggie, and
I feel so guilty.

119
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,166
That I'm failin' you as a
husband and her as a father.

120
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,670
You are the strongest man
I know, any mother would be

121
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,340
lucky to have you as a
father for her children.

122
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,176
This is not easy.

123
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,180
It's hard on me, too.

124
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,809
But we cannot lose our faith.

125
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,065
Honey, without faith,
we don't have hope.

126
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:03,736
- Yeah.
- We have to remain faithful.

127
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,863
Without Maggie, though.

128
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,368
I don't have any faith.

129
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,748
Tristan, if you
lose your faith,

130
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,375
and Maggie sees her
daddy giving up,

131
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,545
how is she supposed
to respond to that?

132
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,717
Maggie's dying.

133
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,765
She's going to die.

134
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,393
You heard that doctor.

135
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:41,732
That doctor does not decide
her fate, any more than we do.

136
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,902
God does.

137
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,699
I know that you're scared.

138
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,455
And I know that you're
angry, I get it.

139
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:10,094
Maggie is in the hands
of the great physician.

140
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,848
She is in the best
place she can be.

141
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:24,565
There's no one more equipped
to make her better than God,

142
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:29,655
and you have to believe
that, you can't let that go.

143
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,291
You're the man of
this house, honey.

144
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,336
You're gonna be
accountable one day.

145
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,173
I can't fight death!

146
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,602
Our daughter is going to die.

147
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,147
Daddy, why are you
yelling at Momma?

148
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,909
Hey, hey, listen.

149
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,119
It's okay, all right?

150
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,704
Let's go back upstairs.

151
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,039
Hold on, Momma.

152
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,792
Dad, we're going
to be all right.

153
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,128
I'm going to be all right.

154
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,131
You and Momma are
going to be all right.

155
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,091
How do you know that, sweetie?

156
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,510
Because I have faith, Daddy.

157
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,765
Come on,
sweetie, let's go to bed.

158
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,153
Bankers.

159
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,672
I don't understand, I mean,
this is why we have insurance.

160
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,590
I mean, you can't do this.

161
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,594
Well, what if...

162
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,765
Well, what if we get
a second opinion?

163
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,162
What do you mean that there's
nothin' that you can do?

164
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,188
I mean, this is why
we pay you guys.

165
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,648
So when somethin'
like this happens,

166
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,942
that you guys are
there to pay for it.

167
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,698
I'll call you back.

168
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,663
Is everything okay?

169
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,457
It's just an angry
customer, how was school?

170
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:28,958
Bad.

171
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,587
Why was it bad?

172
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,173
Well, I don't wanna
go to school anymore.

173
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,011
Why don't you wanna
go to school, Maggie?

174
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,052
Just...

175
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,309
I want to spend more
time with you and Momma.

176
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,646
Maggie, I wanna
spend as much time

177
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,482
as I possibly can with you.

178
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,820
I understand, but you
have to go to school.

179
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,323
Just like I have to work.

180
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,035
You gotta make good grades so
that you can get into college,

181
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:06,038
get a good job, raise a family.

182
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,999
Okay, everything gonna be fine.

183
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,002
We both know that
I'm not gonna make it

184
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,338
into the next grade.

185
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,216
Why do you say that, Maggie?

186
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,092
I'm dying, Dad.

187
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,264
Maggie, don't say that.

188
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,016
We both know that.

189
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,018
I can't do anything about it.

190
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,103
Momma can't do
anything about it.

191
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,647
Maggie.

192
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,190
- I don't wanna die.
- Maggie!

193
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,030
Maggie, you are not gonna die.

194
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,243
You're gonna be fine.

195
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,872
I'm gonna do whatever I have
to do, whatever it takes.

196
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,917
Nothin' is gonna happen to you.

197
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,295
I promise.

198
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,213
Okay?

199
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,258
We are gonna figure this out

200
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,261
and we are gonna get
through this as a family.

201
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,471
Are you sure you're okay?

202
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,932
Yeah, I'm sure.

203
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,979
You're gonna be
fine, I promise, okay?

204
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,355
Okay.

205
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,734
Are you Mr. Johnson?

206
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,821
Yeah, give me one second here.

207
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,781
Go ahead and have a seat.

208
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,872
All right, Mr. Harris, thank
you for coming in today.

209
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,418
I wanted to talk to you
about your insurance.

210
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:40,423
It appears that you've
already capped out

211
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,467
your insurance policy.

212
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,137
What does that mean?

213
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:49,016
It looks like when you
originally bought this policy,

214
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,854
you bought it with a tier
one catastrophic event,

215
00:21:55,272 --> 00:22:01,777
which means that we'll
pay up to $25,000 for, um,

216
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,780
medical expenses.
Wait, wait, wait.

217
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,116
A tier one?

218
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,867
Yes, sir.

219
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,038
Yeah, there's
actually three tiers.

220
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,378
Can we just elevate
it to another tier?

221
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:23,425
Unfortunately it's not the
way the insurance policy works.

222
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,262
Now, this would be considered
a pre-existing condition,

223
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:31,308
and we're not able to change
your policy at this time to...

224
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,368
Well, rewrite the policy.

225
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,477
Well, unfortunately,

226
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,896
I can't just
rewrite this policy.

227
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,272
Why not?

228
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,191
That's just the way
that these policies

229
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,901
were originally written.

230
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,321
Well, she needs
the operation right now.

231
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,907
I understand, sir.

232
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,824
You keep sayin'
that but I don't feel

233
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,410
like you understand,
do you have kids?

234
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,161
I do have kids.

235
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,705
What would you
do in a situation like this?

236
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,084
Well, unfortunately,
knowing the way the insurance

237
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,837
programs work, I don't
see that there's really

238
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,423
anything you're going to
be able to do right now.

239
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:07,928
I'm afraid I've done all I
can to help you with this.

240
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,764
Well, I don't
see how you've done that.

241
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,225
Would you like the paperwork

242
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,851
to file a grievance?

243
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,357
Well, sir, that's
really the only option

244
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,026
that we have right now.

245
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,497
You're sure you wanna do this?

246
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,920
What are we gonna do?

247
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,384
I don't like this, either!

248
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,094
This isn't easy for me.

249
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,847
I don't like seein' her sick.

250
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,891
And I certainly don't
like seeing her afraid.

251
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,767
I don't wanna lose my daughter!

252
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,313
I will do whatever I have
to do to take care of her.

253
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,857
There's nothin' to worry about.

254
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,402
I promise you, okay?

255
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,654
I promise you.

256
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,031
You do whatever it takes.

257
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,576
Because she deserves
a fighting chance.

258
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,871
You're sure you wanna do this?

259
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
Yes.

260
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,083
It's the only way.

261
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,254
You know there's no goin'
back from this, right?

262
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,339
Yes.

263
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,092
Look.

264
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,264
I don't think you do.

265
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,660
Tristan, this decision
isn't just something

266
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,895
you can walk away
from when you want to.

267
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:44,357
You go through with this, and
this'll be with you for life.

268
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:49,362
The only way
you walk away from this,

269
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,615
is to be dead or in jail.

270
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,285
And jail would
just buy you time.

271
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,079
Tristan, these people
don't care about you.

272
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,290
If you're in jail,
they will find you.

273
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,920
Goin' through with this is not
only puttin' yourself at risk

274
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,606
but it's puttin' your
entire family at risk.

275
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,632
My family's already at risk.

276
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:10,966
Look.

277
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,304
I know why you're doing this.

278
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,472
I understand, but
there has to be a...

279
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,017
You don't
understand anything, kid.

280
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,977
I have no choice.

281
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,232
Every man has to be
his own man, I guess.

282
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,609
Bein' a man
has nothing to do with it.

283
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,984
Then what's it about, then?

284
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,154
This is
about a father's promise

285
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,364
to his daughter.

286
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,617
Is Val coming or not?

287
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,744
Any minute now.

288
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,329
He's bringing
the money, right?

289
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,790
Yeah, he'll have the money.

290
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,434
Last chance, Tristan.

291
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,797
Hand sanitizer.

292
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,718
We can't get this at home.

293
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,222
Russia.

294
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,735
You like to fix things, I hear.

295
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,112
It's how I make a living.

296
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,657
So, why do you need my money?

297
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,327
My daughter, Maggie.

298
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,040
How old is
your daughter, Tristan?

299
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:08,543
She's 11 and I need the money,

300
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,796
for her operation,

301
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:15,258
and I'll do whatever
it takes to pay for it.

302
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,094
I'm glad to hear this.

303
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,722
Are you?

304
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,349
Yes, I am.

305
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,068
Mr. Harris.

306
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,113
You know what this is?

307
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,282
That's my daughter's
second chance.

308
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,284
Wrong.

309
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:47,916
Mr. Harris, this is slavery.

310
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,588
We're all slaves to
something, I guess.

311
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,635
Interesting.

312
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,554
But wrong again.

313
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,645
Mr. Harris.

314
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,649
If you take this money,

315
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,569
I own you.

316
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:23,243
You belong to me.

317
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,915
You will do everything
that I tell you to do,

318
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:34,337
when I tell you to do
it, and how to do it.

319
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:45,180
Mr. Harris, this is not a
one-and-done type of situation

320
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:49,561
that we have here, this is not
your average part-time job.

321
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,692
If you come to me later and
you say that your daughter

322
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:01,030
is all better and you no
longer need to work for me,

323
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,203
do you know what I will
do to you, Mr. Harris?

324
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:13,376
Kill your daughter,
right in front of you.

325
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,755
And then I will kill
your pretty wife.

326
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,133
And then I will kill you.

327
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:26,097
I'll even kill the family
dog for the cherry on top.

328
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,768
I'm sure the kid came here today

329
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,353
to try to talk you out of this.

330
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:38,109
Because he knows everything
that I'm telling you

331
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,445
is the truth.

332
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:49,788
Sometimes, family decisions,

333
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:56,336
tend to cloud a man's
judgment from right and wrong.

334
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:08,264
I tell you what I will
do for you, Mr. Harris.

335
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,101
I will give you one hour

336
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,939
to decide whether you
want to take this money.

337
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:21,443
It does not bother me,
one way or the other.

338
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,613
This is strictly business.

339
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,951
One hour, Mr. Harris.

340
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,789
Kid, you come with me.

341
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,928
One hour, kid.

342
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,014
If he does not take
the money, kill him.

343
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,516
Yes, sir.

344
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,980
Dead.

345
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,873
All right, so let
me get this straight.

346
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,041
Your daughter had
a glioblastoma?

347
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,336
Yeah, but it wasn't
the deadliest of forms.

348
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,004
Is she okay?

349
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,381
We'll get to that.

350
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,174
Okay.

351
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,470
Tell me again, why couldn't
the insurance pay for this?

352
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:36,352
Because of the type of surgery
that it was, the cost, it

353
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:40,398
put us outside of our tier or
category, whatever we were in.

354
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,859
Got ya.

355
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,946
So, you and your wife
couldn't afford the surgery.

356
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,824
So, you gotta work for some
gangster and he paid for it?

357
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,866
Yes.

358
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,914
What, you didn't
have any other avenue?

359
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:59,207
Friends, family, a bank,
I don't know, your church?

360
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,962
Look, we didn't have time
to come up with the money.

361
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,257
As soon as we found out about
the surgery, we had to do it.

362
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,761
Got ya.

363
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,388
So, what happened next?

364
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,901
What you watchin'?

365
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,489
Nothing, I
was trying to research

366
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,282
some new insurance policies.

367
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,076
- Did you find any?
- Seems they'd cover Maggie.

368
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,411
- Did you find any?
- No.

369
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,412
No, not yet.

370
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,998
Where have you been?

371
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,419
Did, uh, did
Maggie go to school today?

372
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,257
No, she didn't feel up to it.

373
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,886
We just stayed at home and
watched movies all day.

374
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,430
I fixed her some supper.

375
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,517
Did she hold it down?

376
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,811
No, she threw it up.

377
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:05,400
But I managed to get
her to go to sleep.

378
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:09,444
Yeah, I saw that,
I just tucked her in.

379
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,572
Turned the light off.

380
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,115
I think half the
problem was the fact

381
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,867
that we didn't know
where you were.

382
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,955
Where were you?

383
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,174
What is that?

384
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,971
Where did you get that?

385
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,223
Is that to us?

386
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,576
Tristan, where did
this come from?

387
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,477
The pastor called
me and told me to come to his

388
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:45,940
office, so I went to his office
and he gave me that check.

389
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,567
I cannot believe this.

390
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,528
Yeah.

391
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,072
Somebody from the church, I
guess, found out about Maggie

392
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,616
and, uh, they wrote the check.

393
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,493
Who was it?

394
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,121
I don't know, he
didn't say, I guess they just,

395
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,663
they wanted to be
held anonymous.

396
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,917
Tristan, our
prayers are answered.

397
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,587
- Yeah.
- You don't seem so happy.

398
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,465
What's goin' on with you?
No, no, I'm happy.

399
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,508
I'm just havin' a little trouble

400
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,594
wrappin' my head
around it, I guess.

401
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,095
I know.

402
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,264
Oh, my gosh, this just
came out of nowhere.

403
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,184
- Yeah, it did.
- I love you.

404
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,019
I love you, too.

405
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,731
That was convincing,
I love you.

406
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,441
I love you, too.

407
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,359
It's good to see you smile.

408
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,613
Can I call the doctor now?
Yeah.

409
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,491
All right, I'm gonna
go take a shower.

410
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,034
Okay.

411
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,077
All right.

412
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,043
Hi, yes, this
is Alexis Harris.

413
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,671
I'd like to make an appointment
for my daughter, Maggie.

414
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,716
Yes, thank you.

415
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,105
Yes, we can do tomorrow.

416
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,773
Nine o'clock?

417
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,526
Thank you.

418
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,777
Bye bye.

Take him over
there and plant him down there.

465
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,045
All right.

466
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,382
How long are you gonna
let this man slow us down?

467
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,882
- How do you mean that?
- Like it sounds!

468
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,010
You know they're on our
trail from the river by now.

469
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,095
That's right.

470
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,721
Look, you're
risking the whole bunch.

471
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,907
Why don't you use your
head and leave him here?

472
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,266
He's dying anyway.

473
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,603
You can
leave anytime you want.

474
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,072
I find it rather difficult
with no one to talk to.

475
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,909
Since you also are in the
midst of a personal problem,

476
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,036
well, it seems that, in fact,

477
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,080
it appears at least we
have that in common.

478
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,708
I think we've
enough for a first offense.

479
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,084
You're a saint, I'm a sinner.
Hardly that.

480
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,962
Well, I'm right, you know.

481
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,089
It's an ironical
situation, isn't it?

482
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,426
A mutinous young inspector
leading us all to safety,

483
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:14,847
if possible, and himself to
execution at the same time.

484
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,097
In that case, I think it's he

485
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,600
and I who have the
most in common.

486
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,737
How do you feel?

487
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,074
Did you eat?

488
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,702
I've no
taste in my mouth for food.

489
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,621
You should've,
you'll feel stronger.

490
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,416
- Leave him alone.
- He needs help.

491
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,584
The more he gets,

492
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,585
the more he's
gonna slow us down.

493
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,462
What're you doin'?

494
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,131
I'm reading a book.

495
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,550
Is that okay?

496
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,554
Why don't you go
read it in the bedroom?

497
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,475
Why would you
say that, Tristan?

498
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,103
I wanna sit here and read it,
I haven't seen you all day.

499
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,502
You're readin' a book
and I'm watchin' TV.

500
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,985
How is that seein'?

501
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,572
Can I just sit in
the same room with you?

502
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,157
I'm not bothering you.

503
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:19,035
You are, I was enjoying
my space until you came in.

504
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,746
I'm not in your space.

505
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,873
You've got half the couch.

506
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,479
Will you please
turn that down?

507
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,023
If you don't like it,
go read in the bedroom.

508
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,823
It's okay, I like
to read right here.

509
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,075
Can you turn that down, please?

510
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,079
I told you, you
can go read in the bedroom.

511
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,206
Why are you actin' like this?

512
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,880
I told you, I wanted
to be by myself.

513
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,549
You've been
by yourself all day.

514
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,885
And I'd like to continue it.

515
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,219
What's wrong with you?

516
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,557
What's wrong with me
is I wanna be by myself.

517
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,058
Why do you always
wanna be around?

518
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,103
Why, tell me why.

519
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:29,063
Why don't you
tell me why drinking

520
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,941
has taken over your life?

521
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,068
What is so bad here
that you have to drink...

522
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,614
Because it makes
things tolerable.

523
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,617
And I'm intolerable?

524
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,748
I have done nothing to you.

525
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:49,960
You have no reason
to treat me this way.

526
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,422
Maybe I don't want you around.

527
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,261
You ever thought about that?

528
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,608
Look at me like that,
cry, I don't care.

529
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,277
I just wanna be left alone.

530
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,199
I was
wondering about something.

531
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,326
You're always
wondering about something.

532
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,785
Okay.

533
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,579
So, go read your
book somewhere else.

534
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,041
You've said
enough, I'm leavin'.

535
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,293
Thomas, not very important.

536
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,295
Thomas.

537
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,630
Thomas.

538
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,134
- Anything else?
- Yes.

539
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:42,970
When I woke up before, the
first thing I thought was

540
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,866
I don't want you to go on
thinking that I killed somebody.

541
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:45,890
I didn't.

542
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:47,935
The marshal said you did.

543
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,479
I know,
it's my word against his.

544
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,273
Army sends a patrol.

545
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:56,150
Go on search every couple
of days for Apaches.

546
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:59,279
They get as close to here as
four or five miles sometimes.

547
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,825
There's a busted mirror
over by that bar.

548
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,829
Get a hold of it.

549
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,165
Hold it up to the window,
let the sun hit it.

550
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:12,875
What?

551
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:19,717
What?

552
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,177
What?

553
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,304
Who is Luke?

554
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,639
Luke?

555
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:28,225
He's the youth
pastor at our church.

556
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:31,353
You'd know that, if you came
to church with me and Maggie.

557
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:34,856
Bull.

558
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:39,653
What are you implying,
Tristan, that I'm lying to you?

559
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,072
Who's Luke?

560
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,660
Tristan, what're you
doin', I'm not lyin' to you.

561
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,205
Tristan, you're drunk, okay?

562
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,975
We're not gonna have this
conversation right now.

563
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,207
- Yes, we are.
- No, we're not.

564
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:56,628
Yes, we're having
this conversation now!

565
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,171
Now, answer me!

566
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,218
Now, answer me!

567
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,223
Answer me!

568
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:16,231
So help me god, you
better answer me.

569
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,318
Snap out of it!

570
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,028
I have had it with you!

571
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,071
I have had it!

572
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,741
What has happened to you?

573
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,871
I am so tired of having to
deal with your drinking,

574
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,706
and your sarcasm.

575
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,833
I prayed for you
to come back to me,

576
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,294
and I feel like all
I do is pray for you.

577
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,254
What's wrong with you, Tristan?

578
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,422
What's happened to you?

579
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,425
So what do you wanna do,
you just wanna give up?

580
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,927
Oh, no, no, no.

581
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,388
You're telling me
that I'm giving up?

582
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,016
It sounds like it.

583
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,267
I miss you!

584
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:55,645
I miss the man that I married.

585
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,314
Well, I don't know
how to come back!

586
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:02,027
I am mentally
exhausted, I'm done.

587
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,445
But Tristan, I will
not stay in this house,

588
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:08,449
while you think that you have
the liberty to push me around.

589
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,118
While you have your
little binge drinking,

590
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,347
because you don't know
how to deal with life,

591
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,872
and you won't let
me be a part of it.

592
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,879
A divorce? No.

593
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,799
Sometimes, yes, I would love it,

594
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,968
but no, 'cause I'm not
gonna walk away from you,

595
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,469
but I will tell you this,
Maggie will not see this.

596
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,430
She will not be a part of this.

597
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:34,017
You will not treat me this way
because I do not deserve it!

598
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:38,480
She will not learn that
it is okay for a man

599
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,440
to treat a woman like this.

600
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,733
And more importantly,

601
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:45,737
she is not gonna see her
father acting like this.

602
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,825
Right now, I don't
trust you anymore.

603
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,661
It's gone.

604
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,206
And I think it's time for
you to wake up and realize

605
00:47:56,248 --> 00:48:00,419
that if you don't start changing
something now, we are gone.

606
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,963
Because I will not put
my daughter in danger.

607
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,799
Yeah, that's how far
you've let this come.

608
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,087
Parts will be
here On Wednesday, yeah.

609
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,632
Yep.

610
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:51,970
He will talk to you later.

611
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,433
You have something for me?

612
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,693
You're short, Mr. Harris.

613
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,071
It's all there.

614
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:13,575
You usually do good work,
the best that I've had.

615
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,662
Don't let it happen again.

616
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,289
Wait a minute.

617
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,376
This wasn't our agreement.

618
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,252
You coming into my
place of business.

619
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,462
I don't want people knowing

620
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,130
that I do business
with people like you.

621
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,551
And who's going to
be looking, Mr. Harris?

622
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:35,262
You run a mechanic shop.

623
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:38,016
I drive an old car.

624
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,268
It doesn't matter,
it's the principle.

625
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:45,565
You got something
to say, Mr. Harris?

626
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,359
I wouldn't.

627
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:52,279
I've got a very
important job coming up,

628
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,949
that you just volunteered for.

629
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,284
You be here tonight
at eight o'clock.

630
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,663
The kid will be
here to pick you up.

631
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,460
Oh, by the way.

632
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:10,549
You tell your little
daughter, she's welcome.

633
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,531
So, how are you?

634
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,328
I'm really worried
about Tristan.

635
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,331
Is he still drinking?

636
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:46,251
Sometimes, I feel like
all he does is stare

637
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:49,629
at that whisky bottle,
though, with that empty glass.

638
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,149
Well, have you talked
to him about that?

639
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,173
No.

640
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:57,304
You can't talk to Tristan
about anything right now.

641
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,515
Think he's just
really overwhelmed

642
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,350
with everything
going on with Maggie.

643
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,685
Well, she's doing
better, though, right?

644
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,605
I mean, the treatments
are workin'.

645
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,648
Yeah, yeah.

646
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,108
Gosh, there's not
a day that goes by

647
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,194
that I'm not grateful
for that, I just...

648
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,574
I don't know, it's weird,
it's like he blames himself.

649
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:20,118
Like he feels guilty about it.

650
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,661
The only thing I know to do,

651
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,206
you just have to pray about it.

652
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,332
Well, I am.

653
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:30,544
I don't know, I just, I feel
like it's one of those things

654
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:31,963
that's gonna take time.

655
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,652
Sometimes I feel
like it's too late.

656
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,595
Too late for what?

657
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,681
I don't think any
parent's prepared

658
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,725
to have to deal
with this, you know?

659
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,061
Yeah, I'm sure.

660
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,563
I just have one of
those gut feelings.

661
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:52,609
I don't know, like somethin'
bad's getting ready to happen?

662
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,779
You can't do that, I mean,
worry and stress is like

663
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,573
the worst thing you can do,
it's not gonna help anything.

664
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,908
I know.

665
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,497
You know, every
morning, I wake up,

666
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,415
and I give Tristan over to God.

667
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,254
And then I try to
go about my day,

668
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,673
and I try not to
worry about him.

669
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,277
And then I end up feeling
like an awful wife later,

670
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,720
because I don't know how
to get him to talk to me.

671
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,143
And then Maggie got sick.

672
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,688
And then ever since then,
I've just been walking

673
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:32,649
on egg shells, just
waiting for him...

674
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,444
I don't know.

675
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,784
I don't know what
it is, but he acts

676
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:46,496
like he's just gotta fight
this thing on his own.

677
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,708
Like it's him against the world
and he doesn't even see me.

678
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,227
It's like he looks
straight through me.

679
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,044
He doesn't know
that I'm right here.

680
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,632
But I don't even know if
I'm a right fit for him.

681
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:01,678
You're a great wife and
I know that God put you

682
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,763
and Tristan together
for a reason.

683
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,893
And whatever that reason
is, I know it's a good one.

684
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,477
I mean, the important thing is

685
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,522
that Maggie's
gonna be just fine.

686
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:17,652
And Tristan's gonna
come around, I mean,

687
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,280
maybe it's a man thing
or somethin' that he,

688
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,742
he feels like he can't
protect his family

689
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:29,539
or somethin' like that, but
everything's gonna be just fine.

690
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,376
I promise.

691
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,338
I hope so.

692
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,756
It will be.

693
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,008
I hope you're right.

694
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:02,614
I don't understand why
you think you have a choice.

695
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,699
We always have
a choice, Jacob.

696
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,203
Somebody in your shoes?

697
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,705
They don't have a choice.

698
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,336
Look.

699
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,212
Your daughter's
recoverin', right?

700
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,422
Yes.

701
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,841
Okay, then do you want
everything you've done

702
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,343
up to this point
to be for nothing?

703
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,719
If you're tryin' to
tell me somethin', Jacob,

704
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,887
then just say it.

705
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:29,975
Imagine Val puttin'
her down permanently.

706
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,977
Alongside your wife,
I mean, I don't know

707
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:36,230
if you just don't believe what
Val is capable of, or not.

708
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:39,818
I know who Val is and I know
exactly what he's capable of.

709
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,696
Roughin' people up and
collecting money is one thing,

710
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:45,448
but robbin' a church is
something completely different,

711
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,367
and I will not be a part of it.

712
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,993
I can't be a part of it.

713
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:52,455
Man, I know you did not wanna
get caught up in all this,

714
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,708
and I admire what you're
tryin' to do, Tristan.

715
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:01,798
Look, you do this one job,

716
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,257
and I'm gonna get
you out all this.

717
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,718
How can you say that?

718
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:07,512
We both know that's not a
capability that you have.

719
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,514
Things aren't
always as they seem.

720
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,931
You're gonna trust
me on this one.

721
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,766
And why should I trust you?

722
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,270
I'm gonna pick you up
here, Sunday mornin'.

723
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:23,361
Tristan, just remember this.

724
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:27,991
When the hand reaches out
to pull you back, grab it.

00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:47,886

755

You know, I'm
supposed to trust you.

756
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,130
That was the deal.

757
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,716
But then you go and kidnap
an innocent little girl.

758
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,510
How am I supposed to
trust you after that?

759
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,888
If nobody's cooperating,
what else am I supposed to do?

760
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,139
I don't know,
yell, or somethin'.

761
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,726
But you don't kidnap an
innocent little girl.

762
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,144
That was not a part of the plan.

763
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:44,938
I'm in charge here!

764
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,814
You're not in
charge of anything,

765
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,167
and you need to get that
through your thick skull.

766
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,817
Because when Val gets here,

767
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,837
you know exactly what he's
gonna do to that little girl.

768
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,363
Exactly.

769
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,824
But I'm supposed to
trust you, right?

770
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,701
Right?

771
00:58:58,743 --> 00:58:59,827
Listen!

772
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,705
No, you listen to me.

773
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:06,209
I am tired of people
gettin' hurt on my watch.

774
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:10,338
It's time we play by my rules,
now give me your pistol.

775
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,715
Turn around.

776
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,185
You did this to yourself.

777
00:59:25,186 --> 00:59:26,437
Let's go.

778
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:34,821
Listen to me.

779
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,616
I'm not gonna hurt you.

780
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,368
Do you understand?

781
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,038
Do you understand?
Just get me outta here.

782
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:48,084
You gotta do
exactly what I say, understand?

783
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,587
- Yes.
- Let's go.

784
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,087
Stop.

785
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,172
Turn around.

786
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:41,137
You know why you're here, right?

787
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,740
I guess we have
business to talk about,

788
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,325
that you didn't want
anybody else hearing?

789
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,516
- Something like that.
- Really?

790
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,811
- I think you know, Jacob.
- Know what?

791
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,164
That you should probably
give up being a mechanic?

792
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:52,231
I know that you're
an informant, Jacob.

793
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,985
- I see.
- I have no choice.

794
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,820
You might wanna rethink that.

795
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,698
We both know you're
not a killer.

796
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:05,870
And we both know that you're
not gonna pull that trigger.

797
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:11,209
Think about Maggie.

798
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,710
This isn't you, Tristan.

799
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,006
Tristan, I'm a cop.

800
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,597
See?

801
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,057
You're not a killer.

802
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,686
You're just a father tryin'
to save his daughter.

803
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:35,316
If I untie
you, can you show a badge?

804
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,070
Turn around.

805
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:57,922
I've been undercover
for four years now.

806
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,800
- But you're just a kid.
- I'm 23, Tristan.

807
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,760
But that's exactly
how I got this job.

808
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:06,222
See, no one suspects a
kid to be undercover.

809
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,348
Where does this leave me now?

810
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:10,977
The thing
you don't understand,

811
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:13,020
is Val is connected all
the way up the ladder.

812
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,939
I need enough to
through life at him,

813
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,733
so he will give up
these other people.

814
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:21,320
Five, even 10 years, doesn't
matter to these guys.

815
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:25,283
My family cannot find
out what I've done.

816
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,326
You're not hearin' me.

817
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:31,205
If you help me, I can get
those charges dropped.

818
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,708
And you and your family
will walk away from this.

819
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,754
How will they be protected?

820
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:41,257
We will put all of y'all
in Witness Protection.

821
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,884
And that's a promise.

822
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,469
So, what's the plan?

823
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,071
You are late.

824
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:08,117
No, do not makes
excuses with me.

825
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:14,791
It is your responsibility to
make sure that he goes nowhere.

826
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:20,087
You know the location, I
will see you there tomorrow.

827
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,210
Jesus, dude.

828
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:02,964
Did you kill anybody?

829
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,884
I didn't kill anybody.

830
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,014
Just tune people up and
collected, that's it.

831
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:19,814
All right, so your daughter's
surgery was a success.

832
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:23,317
But you couldn't get out from
under this Val Drexel guy?

833
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:26,403
And he has you goin' around
town doin' all these odd jobs,

834
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:29,198
and in the midst of all
this, you kidnap some kid?

835
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,325
And this set you off, so
you're gonna go kill Jacob,

836
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:33,286
but you didn't...

837
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:36,080
Look, I didn't know
what I was gonna do.

838
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:39,125
I didn't, I didn't know if I
was gonna kill Jacob or not,

839
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,878
I just knew that I could not
be a part of this anymore.

840
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:43,504
Couldn't do it anymore.

841
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:48,986
But the only way that
I could get out of it

842
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,761
was to help Jacob take Val out.

843
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,556
Wow.

844
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,476
So, what happened next?

845
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:19,373
Val, everything's
under control.

846
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,502
Everything is not
all right for you, kid.

847
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:45,746
Where am I?

848
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:53,712
Alexis?

849
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:56,674
Maggie?

850
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:02,512
Maggie!

851
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:08,936
Tristan.

852
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:13,149
My son.

853
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,394
Daddy?

854
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,730
All of us must die eventually.

855
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:58,194
Our lives are like water,
spilled out on the ground.

856
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:01,322
It can't be gathered
back up again.

857
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:18,671
I don't understand.

858
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:19,840
Where am I?

859
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,677
Where you're supposed to be.

860
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:39,526
I don't
understand what's going on.

861
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:42,238
You don't need to.

862
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:46,116
But God just
does not sweep life away.

863
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:57,920
Instead, he provides us
ways to bring us back.

864
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,881
Until you've been
separated from him.

865
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:35,666
Tristan, my son.

866
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,752
My work cannot be
destroyed as I cannot be.

867
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,132
Everyone will come to know
me in this life or after.

868
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,759
Just as you're being judged,

869
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:49,430
everyone will be judged when
this day comes for them.

870
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:52,308
I knew you before you were.

871
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:54,727
It's finished, Dad.

872
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,770
It's time to come back.

873
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:58,271
It's time.

874
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,815
Don't be afraid.

875
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:02,443
Be strong and courageous.

876
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:04,444
Don't be terrified of this.

877
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:07,781
For the Lord, your God
walks by your side.

878
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:09,782
And I've always
had faith in you,

879
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:11,785
even when you didn't in me.

880
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:12,786
He will never leave you.

881
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:15,956
I created you
with a purpose, Tristan.

882
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,624
He will never forsake you.

883
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:19,501
Now...

884
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:21,294
Come back, Daddy.

885
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:23,255
Go and fulfill your purpose.

886
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:25,591
Come back, Daddy.

887
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:27,885
And do it with faith and love.

888
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:30,387
As I created you to do.

889
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:31,972
Because you are forgiven.

890
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,861
Wait a minute.

891
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:48,697
So, you're telling me
you were clinically dead?

892
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:49,990
Yes, I was.

893
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:54,286
And during this time is
when you claim you saw God

894
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:55,788
during all this?

895
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:00,167
I'm not claiming anything.

896
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:04,671
But I know what I saw.

897
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,424
And what I felt.

898
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,260
Okay.

899
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:14,014
All right, I'll bite.

900
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,849
So, what did God tell you?

901
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:19,353
That I wasn't
fulfilling my purpose.

902
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,355
- What's your purpose?
- I don't know.

903
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:23,523
Hm.

904
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,025
What about this
church you robbed?

905
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:28,862
I think I remember reading
something about that.

906
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:33,116
"For if you forgive
men their trespasses,

907
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:36,035
"your heavenly father
will also forgive you.

908
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:38,789
"But if you do not forgive
men their trespasses,

909
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,791
"neither will your
father forget your"...

910
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:41,874
Dad?

911
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:44,043
Yes, sweetheart?

912
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:46,588
I overheard your
conversation with Mom today.

913
01:13:48,006 --> 01:13:49,842
What've I told you
about eavesdropping?

914
01:13:49,883 --> 01:13:52,885
I know, Dad, it's just that...

915
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:54,054
Nevermind.

916
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:56,389
No, come on, what is it?

917
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:00,393
Well, I was just
curious about Mr. Harris.

918
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:01,913
What about him, what're
you curious about?

919
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,064
What's gonna happen to him?

920
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,317
What do you mean?

921
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:09,903
Did he go to heaven?

922
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:12,406
Or hell?

923
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:15,742
Well, I hope he went
to heaven, sweetheart.

924
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,995
What do you think will
happen with him and God?

925
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:25,669
That's between
God and Mr. Harris.

926
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,420
God knows his heart
better than anybody,

927
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:31,008
and it's up to him to judge
his fate, it's not up to us.

928
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:33,677
But won't God forgive him?

929
01:14:34,928 --> 01:14:36,722
Why do you ask that?

930
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:39,850
Because God forgives
all his children.

931
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:41,977
Right?

932
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:43,562
Of he does.

933
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:47,733
So, everybody at the
church will, too, right?

934
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:50,777
I don't know about
that, sweetheart.

935
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:58,076
So, what do you
think I should do?

936
01:14:58,118 --> 01:14:59,661
About what, Dad?

937
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:00,829
About Mr. Harris.

938
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:03,707
Do you think we should
all forgive him?

939
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:08,128
If God's forgiven Mr.
Harris, why can't you?

940
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:12,883
But do you think
he deserves to be forgiven

941
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,593
after everything that he's done?

942
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:18,055
He done nothing to us,
but everything to God.

943
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:21,308
That's why God is
the judge and not us.

944
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:38,450
I can't believe we're
still discussing this.

945
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,660
A man robs a church and now

946
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:43,664
we're thinking
about forgiving him?

947
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:44,915
I understand that,

948
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,918
but I still feel we
need to pray about it!

949
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,002
What do we even
need to pray about?

950
01:15:50,003 --> 01:15:52,881
What did Jesus do when the
traitors were in his house?

951
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:54,716
He kicked them out.
I agree.

952
01:15:54,758 --> 01:15:55,926
That's not the way it went.

953
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:59,179
They were not his children,
they were lost and of the world!

954
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,515
And I think we still
need to remember here

955
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,392
that Tristan is a child of God.

956
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,269
Amen.

957
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:07,521
I think he's just a
man who's lost his way.

958
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,022
How do we even know that?

959
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:10,107
We don't!

960
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:11,775
He's probably in hell.

961
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:18,865
I mean...

962
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:23,495
How can a child of
God rob a church?

963
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:26,164
I don't understand why we're
still having this discussion!

964
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:28,226
That's what we've been
trying to get across to you.

965
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:31,837
No, what I meant was, what
are we really afraid of?

966
01:16:31,878 --> 01:16:33,589
To forgive him?

967
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:36,550
Of what comes next!

968
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:39,219
I don't follow you, Burgess.

969
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:43,015
All right, let me
paint you a picture.

970
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:46,727
A man robs a church,
the church forgives him.

971
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,854
Every criminal around
the country would be

972
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:51,148
kicking in the
doors of churches,

973
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:53,733
and what would that
have for public opinion?

974
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:58,280
That we condone the
criminals and their actions?

975
01:16:58,322 --> 01:16:59,740
Can't you see?

976
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:01,908
We don't argue.

977
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,161
We never argue.

978
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:06,163
All the years that I've
been on this council,

979
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:08,165
we don't argue.

980
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:12,668
Lucifer is trying to allow
himself into this church

981
01:17:12,669 --> 01:17:16,381
because of the crimes
of Mr. Harris's.

982
01:17:18,675 --> 01:17:22,929
Now, I am sorry, Pastor,
but there's just no way

983
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:25,891
that we could forgive Tristan.

984
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:29,727
I admire that you've got
this council together

985
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:33,398
to make sure that we do it
right, but there's no way.

986
01:17:37,277 --> 01:17:39,779
Does it matter
what they think?

987
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,240
You should only care
what God thinks.

988
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:45,952
Pray to him and he
will answer you.

989
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,120
This could be an
opportunity for the church

990
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:51,667
to show the world God's
compassion for his children.

991
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:55,462
And maybe help bring
the lost to light.

992
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,654
Sir?

993
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:22,823
You okay?

994
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,282
Pastor.

995
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:26,493
Yes, I'm fine.

996
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,187
So, what'd you
guys think about the movie?

997
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:55,354
- It was great.
- It was scary.

998
01:18:55,355 --> 01:18:56,189
It was?

999
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:58,065
What about when that guy popped
out from behind the rock,

1000
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,026
was it a little scary?
Enough.

1001
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,654
That was so much fun, wasn't it?

1002
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:03,696
Yep.

1003
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:05,417
Can we get some money
to play video games?

1004
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:07,993
Yeah, I think
that's all right.

1005
01:19:08,952 --> 01:19:10,704
Here you go.

1006
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,539
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1007
01:19:13,373 --> 01:19:14,374
How're you doin'?

1008
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:18,003
Let's take a seat for a moment.

1009
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:24,049
Ever since we talked yesterday,

1010
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:25,260
you've been on my heart.

1011
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:31,266
And what you shared,
that was an amazing tale.

1012
01:19:32,058 --> 01:19:35,645
But I don't really know
what you need from me.

1013
01:19:36,646 --> 01:19:38,814
I just need advice 'cause
I don't know what to do.

1014
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:40,567
I don't have the
answers this time.

1015
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,405
Are you sure that God
hasn't already revealed it?

1016
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:48,784
If he has, I don't
know what it is.

1017
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:52,287
Are you listening,
truly listening?

1018
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:53,746
Always.

1019
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:56,500
Because I think he
has spoken to you.

1020
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:02,422
It's like your daughter said.

1021
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:06,301
This is an amazing opportunity.

1022
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:10,597
But when I think of the
word one, unity comes to mind.

1023
01:20:12,432 --> 01:20:16,228
I believe, with all my heart,
that if a group of people

1024
01:20:16,269 --> 01:20:17,771
could stand together as one,

1025
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:20,398
we can change the world for
the betterment of it all.

1026
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:23,377
And we tell ourselves we
just need to pray about it,

1027
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:25,778
but sometimes before we do
that, we have to ask ourselves,

1028
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:28,949
what exactly do we
do when we pray?

1029
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:32,327
And right now,
we're just talking.

1030
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:33,411
Just talking.

1031
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:36,373
But are we listening?

1032
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:39,793
'Cause if we're not
listening, we're not watching,

1033
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,295
and if we're not watching,
how in the world can we see

1034
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:44,797
the opportunity
that lies before us?

1035
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:48,634
Excuse me, Pastor, I
think I speak for all of us

1036
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:51,470
when I say, what are
you talking about?

1037
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:53,264
I'm talking about the
opportunity that lies at hand,

1038
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:54,431
Mr. Burgess, I
don't think you see

1039
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:55,641
the magnitude of the situation.

1040
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:58,602
And I don't think you see
the gravity of this situation.

1041
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:00,437
If you don't get this
right, there's gonna be

1042
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:03,023
a lot of people that
walk out the front door.

1043
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:07,195
And Pastor, you have to
look for a new church home.

1044
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,443
What's wrong, sweetheart?

1045
01:21:46,484 --> 01:21:49,195
It's just, the more I think
about it, I just wonder,

1046
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:52,824
what if they tell us to leave?
Then we find a new home.

1047
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:55,452
- It's not that simple, Ruth.
- Isn't it?

1048
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:57,454
No, it's not.

1049
01:21:58,413 --> 01:21:59,414
Why not?

1050
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,503
See? It is that simple.

1051
01:22:05,545 --> 01:22:07,881
What does your heart tell you?

1052
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,516
That we forgive this man.

1053
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:21,895
Well, maybe I'm just
playing devil's advocate here,

1054
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,396
but they're not gonna understand

1055
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:25,315
why the church
should forgive him.

1056
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:28,276
I don't care how smooth
you lay it over to them.

1057
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:30,903
You have to remember, they're
not meant to understand.

1058
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,238
They're meant to be led.

1059
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,658
So, lead them, show
them the endgame.

1060
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:38,203
And it doesn't matter
if they ask you

1061
01:22:38,244 --> 01:22:40,205
to leave the church or not.

1062
01:22:40,246 --> 01:22:42,499
Your home isn't the church.

1063
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:45,627
Your home is in the constant
presence of God Almighty.

1064
01:22:46,586 --> 01:22:50,757
And whatever God asks you
to do, you do, period.

1065
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:53,885
And it sounds to me like
God is asking you to lead

1066
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:57,097
these people and show the
world what it's forgotten.

1067
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:07,107
I understand the hard
road's never the easiest,

1068
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:10,026
or the most popular,
and I understand that.

1069
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:13,445
But by the same token I am your
pastor and I am your leader,

1070
01:23:13,446 --> 01:23:15,115
and we will forgive this man,

1071
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:17,200
as God has forgiven
the rest of us.

1072
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:20,429
And maybe in the meantime
we'll even teach the world what

1073
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:23,622
it's forgotten, whether that
be forgiveness or compassion.

1074
01:23:23,623 --> 01:23:26,959
But until then, we
will forgive this man,

1075
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:31,047
for every single child of
God deserves to be forgiven.

1076
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:40,640
All right, well, time out.

1077
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:43,435
You're telling me the
church just forgave you?

1078
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:47,355
The pastor did, but I
went and talked to him,

1079
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:50,734
and I explained everything and
we understand each other now.

1080
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:53,402
And the church is just
okay with this stuff?

1081
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:54,695
You show up, you sing a song,

1082
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:56,736
you put money in the offering
plate, or you take it.

1083
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:01,619
The pastor and I had
a good conversation and

1084
01:24:01,661 --> 01:24:03,329
that's all you need to know.

1085
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,333
All right, is
that the end of it?

1086
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:09,419
Not quite.

1087
01:24:10,503 --> 01:24:11,713
Elaborate.

1088
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:14,299
After the shootout,
Val Drexel escaped,

1089
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:18,178
and no one
could seem to find him.

1090
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,514
How did he do that?

1091
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:24,642
It's Val Drexel, I don't know.

1092
01:24:24,684 --> 01:24:26,352
Hm, conspiracy.

1093
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:27,562
I see.

1094
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:29,022
What happened then?

1095
01:24:34,694 --> 01:24:35,694
Lord.

1096
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,907
I'm not much of a prayer guy.

1097
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:41,910
I know I need to be.

1098
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:44,913
I'm gonna try my best.

1099
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:51,544
And Lord, you know my history
and where I come from.

1100
01:24:52,128 --> 01:24:57,383
And I didn't grow up with you,
but I'm glad I've found you.

1101
01:24:58,676 --> 01:25:03,139
Even though you've been there
along the way, waiting for me.

1102
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:06,642
But Lord...

1103
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:10,605
I'm strugglin'.

1104
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:13,316
I'm tryin' so hard
to follow you.

1105
01:25:14,692 --> 01:25:19,572
But this man, this man has
my family and I'm afraid.

1106
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:25,120
I'm afraid to lose them, knowin'
I could've done somethin'.

1107
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:29,666
As much as I don't wanna
sacrifice my faith,

1108
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:34,087
I don't wanna sacrifice
my family for it.

1109
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:37,257
So, I need your help.

1110
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:39,843
I need your help.

1111
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:43,638
I don't wanna be
violent anymore.

1112
01:25:45,181 --> 01:25:47,433
I just need my family back.

1113
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:48,935
Please, God.

1114
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,813
Please, please.

1115
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:53,272
Please.

1116
01:25:53,773 --> 01:25:55,984
I need my family back.

1117
01:25:58,361 --> 01:25:59,611
With Val Drexel in the wind,

1118
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:02,198
Jacob did uphold his
end of the bargain,

1119
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,242
and he put my family
into Witness Protection.

1120
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:05,785
And you didn't join them?

1121
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:07,578
No.

1122
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:09,747
I couldn't, it...

1123
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:14,586
It was just more dangerous
for my family if I was there,

1124
01:26:14,627 --> 01:26:16,670
so I stayed somewhere separate,

1125
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,089
I thought that it would be safe.

1126
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:21,968
But I was wrong.

1127
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:27,472
This, this guy, Sergei,
he came outta nowhere.

1128
01:26:27,473 --> 01:26:30,976
He somehow figured out
where my family was hiding

1129
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:33,103
in Witness Protection
and he kidnapped 'em,

1130
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:35,606
in order to get
me to come to him,

1131
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:38,484
and do whatever he
needed me to do.

1132
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:43,323
So, what did he
want with your family?

1133
01:26:44,782 --> 01:26:46,326
Where's my wife and daughter?

1134
01:26:48,661 --> 01:26:49,996
My apologies.

1135
01:26:59,255 --> 01:27:01,549
Then tell me
where they're at or not.

1136
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:04,010
Straight to business.

1137
01:27:05,178 --> 01:27:06,763
I can respect that.

1138
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:09,599
Your respect isn't worth
the bullet to kill it.

1139
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:19,692
You are an example man.

1140
01:27:21,694 --> 01:27:24,113
You learn by
example, do you not?

1141
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:27,700
Depends on what I'm
trying to learn exactly.

1142
01:27:32,538 --> 01:27:34,707
Exactly who you
are dealing with.

1143
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:36,876
Wade.

1144
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:38,920
Come here.

1145
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:43,966
Tell me.

1146
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:48,221
How long have you
worked with me?

1147
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,806
Seven years.

1148
01:27:49,847 --> 01:27:51,891
Hm, seven years.

1149
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:54,310
That is a long time.

1150
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,153
Take Wade, for example.

1151
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:10,910
He worked for me for seven
years, and in the end,

1152
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:13,454
was only worth
making example of.

1153
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:21,129
What're you trying to tell me?

1154
01:28:21,879 --> 01:28:25,842
That I want Val
Drexel brought here,

1155
01:28:25,883 --> 01:28:30,596
or else your wife and daughter
will be my next examples.

1156
01:28:35,935 --> 01:28:38,603
And how am I
supposed to do that?

1157
01:28:38,604 --> 01:28:39,939
Find a way.

1158
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:45,320
If you weren't my only
option, you wouldn't be here.

1159
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:53,118
So, this guy, Sergei, he's
holding your family hostage

1160
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:54,536
until you deliver Val to him?

1161
01:28:54,537 --> 01:28:55,537
Yes.

1162
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:58,123
But I thought you just
said no one could find him?

1163
01:28:58,124 --> 01:29:00,543
He found me.

1164
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:03,796
Did you go see him?

1165
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:07,443
It's been very
long time, Tristan.

1166
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:12,031
Yeah, it has.

1167
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:21,207
You are probably
asking yourself,

1168
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:24,043
why this place?

1169
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:29,965
Isn't this where
one comes to deal

1170
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:32,135
with their issues from the past?

1171
01:30:39,016 --> 01:30:40,977
Why now, Tristan?

1172
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:49,485
Why you find me now?

1173
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:55,116
I need your help.

1174
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:00,955
Interesting.

1175
01:31:05,751 --> 01:31:11,298
What in the world could you
possibly need with this old,

1176
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:13,134
broken down Russian?

1177
01:31:21,934 --> 01:31:24,312
So, did you take
Val to Sergei?

1178
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:26,605
No.

1179
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:28,566
But what about your family?

1180
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:30,943
Look, the thing you
need to understand about Val

1181
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:32,862
is why he does what he does.

1182
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:37,992
Okay.

1183
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:39,285
Tell me.

1184
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:44,415
It was about 10 years
ago in Minsk, Belarus.

1185
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:47,209
Val Drexel was actually
an undercover cop, okay?

1186
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:50,629
And he was investigating
Sergei's crime family.

1187
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:53,716
Sergei didn't know
this, but one day,

1188
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:55,467
Val Drexel's little
daughter gets killed,

1189
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:58,470
and it was Sergei that
did it, but he didn't know

1190
01:31:58,471 --> 01:32:00,805
that this little girl was
Val Drexel's daughter,

1191
01:32:00,806 --> 01:32:02,057
but even still, he
was in enough trouble,

1192
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:04,060
so he had to flee the country.

1193
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:08,231
When he fled the country Val
Drexel followed him, came here.

1194
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:13,151
But his undercover stuff was
still intact and he had to do

1195
01:32:13,152 --> 01:32:15,905
whatever he had to do
to get closer to Sergei.

1196
01:32:17,156 --> 01:32:20,201
So, that's why Val had
to keep this mobster cover.

1197
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:23,996
But yet, he somehow wound
up on Jacob's radar anyway.

1198
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:25,331
Exactly.

1199
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:28,833
So, Val used you.

1200
01:32:28,834 --> 01:32:30,211
No.

1201
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:31,629
We used each other.

1202
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:36,841
I don't know.

1203
01:32:36,842 --> 01:32:39,011
This all seems so
incriminating if I publish it.

1204
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:42,180
Look, look, look, don't
worry about my immunity.

1205
01:32:42,181 --> 01:32:44,015
I've got that taken care of.

1206
01:32:44,016 --> 01:32:46,644
What do you want me
to do with this story?

1207
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:48,187
I don't know,
I'm not the writer.

1208
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:51,649
I just wanna know why
I'm being told about this.

1209
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:54,735
Look, the thing is,

1210
01:32:56,195 --> 01:32:58,072
I've made a lot of
mistakes in my life.

1211
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:04,495
But fighting for my family
will never be one of them.

1212
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:07,498
And I've hurt a lot of
people along the way,

1213
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:11,377
just to make sure that my
daughter had a shot at life.

1214
01:33:14,213 --> 01:33:17,133
And the things that I've done,
I will have to pay for 'em.

1215
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:20,136
And I'll have to live with them.

1216
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:26,892
And I don't know God's plan.

1217
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:29,145
And I don't pretend to.

1218
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:35,443
I just need you to
write this story...

1219
01:33:37,236 --> 01:33:40,948
And let God do his work.

1220
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:48,289
That's all I got,
thanks for the coffee.

1221
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:54,420
Wait!

1222
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,924
You never even told me what
happened to your family.

1223
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:00,301
Did Val help?

1224
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:02,136
I mean, what happened to Sergei?

1225
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:05,598
Did you at least get
your family back?

1226

1227
