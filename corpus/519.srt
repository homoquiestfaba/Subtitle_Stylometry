00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,009
- Heinrich!
- Turn off the airintake!

2
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:43,010
- Stubborn bastards, those americans.
- All ahead, 15 degrees starboard.

3
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,615
- They're leaving.
- They're leaving.

4
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:06,896
Periscopedepth. We'll teach them
who the stubborn ones are.

- 286 degrees, 15 knots.
- Distance: 2700 meters.

6
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,210
Ready tubes 3 and 4.

7
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,969
Ready.

8
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,014
- 112 degrees.
- Torpedo ready?

9
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,290
3 and 4 ready.

10
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,015
Ready.

11
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,338
Fire.

12
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,419
Yes! We got her!

13
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,249
We got her!

14
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,854
- A good yankee is a good yankee.
- We dive.

15
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:06,530
- How is Heinrich?
- Concussion. He'll be okay.

16
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,698
Good, I'll check in on him later.

17
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,659
- Good move.
- You always win anyway.

18
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,693
- Do you know what your problem is?
- My queen is in a bad position.

19
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,460
You always underestimate yourself.

20
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,336
You should have been a commander yourself,
instead of hanging around me.

21
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,448
I thought that you would be more cheerful,
after we sunk that cruiser.

22
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:46,217
We sink one, they sink 30.
We're lucky, that the torpedo exploded.

23
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,288
- The Americans joined the war.
- It didn't go so well last night.

24
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,654
It'll all be better soon.
With a little luck...

25
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,819
With a little luck,
we'll make it home in one piece.

26
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,458
- What is it, Bauer?
- Look at this.

27
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,337
Allways when you least expect it.

28
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,579
- How many moves do I have left?
- Two.

29
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,214
Chess...

30
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,008
...mate.

31
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,658
Good, I hate chess.
I get worse for every move.

32
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,691
- Sorry to disturb you, Captain.
- We're finished.

33
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,813
We got a message...
from home.

34
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,338
Give it to me.

35
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,414
Jonas, what does it say?

36
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,098
I need a moment alone.

37
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,014
They bombed Hamburg.
His daughters school is completely destroyed.

38
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,257
No survivors.

39
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,613
- Torpedoes... Fire.

40
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,458
We have to surface.

41
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,569
Jonas, It's night.
We have to surface.

42
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,648
- Yes, prepare for surfacing.
- Ready for surfacing.

43
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,171
We couldn't stop the bleeding
in the brain.

44
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,772
How old was he? 18?

45
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,417
Heinrich wanted to show
what he could.

46
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,895
From the first day.

47
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,049
You couldn't do anything.
You couldn't stop it.

48
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,619
No...

49
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,290
That's the problem.

50
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,976
Captain...

51
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,134
Glenn Miller?

52
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,655
Good.

53
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,096
- Torpedoes!
- Damn!

54
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,610
All Ahead full. Dive!

55
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,180
Where the hell is he?

56
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,613
Två subs.
One of ours and an american.

57
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,779
- Distance?
- 4000 meter.

58
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:32,896
- She's right in front of us.
- Distance 400 meters. Fire!

59
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,459
Follow me. Now!

60
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,128
Come.

61
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,450
Move!

62
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,688
Move it!

63
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,328
You're not scared of a few americans?

64
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,532
I'm worried about supplies.

65
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,858
We'll be at the supply wessel in a week. We have enough supplies.

66
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,449
There's nothing to worry about.

67
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,495
When we get there, we'll turn
over the americans for interrogation.

68
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,620
Klaus, could you give us a moment.

69
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,934
As you wish.

70
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,329
What is it?

71
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:11,411
You said it yourself - the war is ending.
Why risk everything now?

72
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:19,172
Make sure my orders are followed, Ludwig.

73
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,810
Yes, captain.

74
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:48,813
- Why the hell did he bring them onboard?
- There are rules in war.

75
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:55,128
Not when they just sunk one of ours.
The entire crew were killed.

76
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:00,368
- Our Comrades!
- Are you questioning him?

77
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:08,611
I don't doubt the captains
orders. Neither should you.

78
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,018
He puts us in danger.

79
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,690
That's what war is.

80
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,816
Eat.

81
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,453
They don't understand a word.

82
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,931
Here you go.
I hope you like it.

83
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,098
Leave it.

84
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,696
Chain them, and give him medicine.

85
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,098
- Let him die.
- Do as I say!

86
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,293
Take his handcuffs off

87
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,420
For him.

88
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,572
What are you looking at, Rat?

89
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:08,011
Not only are you eating our food,
I also have to look at you.

90
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,260
Thats enough.

91
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:34,254
I hurt everywhere
and it's difficult to breathe.

92
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,931
I'll give to something for the pain. Get some rest.

93
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,938
You'll be well soon.

94
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:09,733
- How many?
- Eight sick. Others have the symptoms.

95
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,613
Captain, come here, please.

96
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,899
We're almost there,
but the supply vessel isn't here.

97
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,651
- What do you mean?
- They aren't answering to our radiosignals.

98
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,170
- Are we in the right position?
- Yes.

99
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,133
Damn! Up periscope.

100
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:45,055
An american destroyer. Damn!

101
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,537
- Distance?
- 2500 meter2.

102
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,219
2500.

103
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,257
Captain?

104
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,533
What's your command?
We must act.

105
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,454
- How many torpedoes do we have?
- Two front, one stern.

106
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:42,450
Ready one and two.
Set torpedo depth at 5 meters.

107
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,928
1800 meters.

108
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,974
Otto, Come here.

109
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,849
- Torpedoes ready.
- Ready.

110
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,569
Now!

111
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,368
Torpedoes ready.

112
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:27,535
- The americans escaped!
- I told you it would happen!

113
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,371
- Cooper!
- Nej!

114
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,892
Stop!

115
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,731
Dive!
Deapth: stern minus 20, bow minus 30.

116
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:55,489
- Quick!
- Everybody to the front!

117
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,612
Hurry! Quick!

118
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,737
50 meters.

119
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,451
Back!

120
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:00,736
- We have to get rid of the americans.
- Here? A mass execution?

121
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:06,856
I want to get rid of them as well. But we
can't get rid of the bodies.

122
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,335
I can live with the smell.

123
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:15,578
- What is it, Bauer?
- There's something you have to see.

124
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:19,614
Wilhelm was the first to
get the symtoms. Here.

125
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:33,453
The americans are like the plague.
And we have them here on board.

126
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,859
- The crew must not know.
- What? But the americans...

127
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,815
That is an order!
And you will obey.

128
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,459
Everybody must wear the breathing apparatus,
until we can surface.

129
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:59,973
- The americans can't have any.
- Everybody must wear the breathing apparatus.

130
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:09,175
Ja, Captain.
How long are we staying down here?

131
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,338
As long as we can.

132
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:46,815
- Is she still there?
- Perhaps.

133
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:50,695
"Perhaps" is not good enough.

134
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:00,691
- Ready to surface.
- We'll be an easy target.

135
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:05,291
What would you prefer?
Dying here or up there?

136
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,890
At least we have a chance up there.

137
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,889
Surface.

138
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:50,692
We're clear!

139
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,532
Transmit emergency signal.

140
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:17,938
- Family?

141
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:43,175
- Yes, my son.

142
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:55,099
Never forget this is the enemy.

143
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,531
Take care of your own men.
Out.

144
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:03,895
Eat!

145
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,859
And?

146
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:12,969
Every second is precious.

147
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:19,213
We must do something about the americans.

148
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,138
Take off his handcuffs.

149
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,419
That is all.

150
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:33,455
That he's speaking to them - that alone
is treason.

151
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:37,778
You've seen how he behaves.
He's insane.

152
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:43,009
This is insane.

153
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:47,372
- What do we do?
- I refuse to obey him.

154
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,538
I hope
that you won't either.

155
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,419
Jonas!

156
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:42,733
- You can't just surrender.
- It's my duty to save the men.

157
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,296
Don't surrender us to them!

158
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:51,533
- We can manage without them.
- If only we could.

159
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,613
Ludwig!

160
01:00:54,740 --> 01:01:01,373
- Your name is Hans, right?

161
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:13,136
Go to hell.

162
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:32,218
- Have we surrendered captain?
- Shut up! This is my boat!

163
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:35,492
I make the decicions.

164
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:41,410
We won't make it home, not in this boat.

165
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:45,215
If you want to die, we all die.

166
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:51,328
But if you want to make it back home alive
this is our only chance.

167
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,294
Come on!

168
01:02:55,420 --> 01:03:01,211
Ahead, half speed.

169
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,934
Confirm course.

170
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:26,891
- 285.

171
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:36,575
All ahead, full.

172
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:05,416
We must do something.

173
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:31,976
Stop at once!

174
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:49,612
You will get what you deserve!

175
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:02,811
- Whats happening?
- We're being attacked. Hurry!

176
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:18,610
No, leave it.
Put down the phone.

177
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:24,736
- The torpedo will explode! Are you mad?
- You can ask the captain about that.

178
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:30,409
Go up there. Go!

179
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,939
Put down the gun!

180
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:37,334
Hands up!

181
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:41,328
Traitor! I will not let
you surrender the boat.

182
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:46,136
- Are you going to kill us all?
- I'd rather die with my honor intact!

183
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:49,650
- No more talk now. The war is over.
- Exactly.

184
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:05,693
Go to...!

185
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:45,933
Jonas!

186
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:59,569
It's your boat now

01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,577
Get the crew home.

188
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,898
Damn.

189
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:51,653
- If we surface, they can attack.

190
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:07,609
Prepare to surface.

191
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:21,129
Ready one and two.
Sink the traitor!

192
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:41,815
Fire!

193
01:17:54,740 --> 01:18:01,259
All ahead, full. 110 starboard.
Torpedo three and four reload. Ready one for fire.

194
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:09,695
Fire!

195
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:41,532
Cease fire! Cease fire! There's germans on board
and we're in control.

196
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:47,258
- Cease fire!
- Prepare for combat.

197
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:53,577
- Next time we're dead.
- It's our countrymen.

198
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:59,059
- They're going to kill us!

199
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:29,131
Ready three and four.

200
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:49,540
On my command, all ahead, full.
