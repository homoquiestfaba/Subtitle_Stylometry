1
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:37,623
<i>And tonight we embark on the</i>
<i>last and most ambitious</i>

2
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,993
<i>phase of our campaign to end</i>
<i>tyranny across the globe.</i>

3
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,228
<i>Mr. President,</i>
<i>given the severity</i>

4
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,763
<i>of the current crisis</i>

5
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,899
<i>what is the risk</i>
<i>to the American population?</i>

6
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:49,168
<i>Our level of preparedness</i>
<i>couldn't be higher.</i>

7
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,437
<i>I am confident that we will</i>
<i>prevail, whatever may come.</i>

8
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,373
<i>But, Mr. President...</i>

9
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,776
<i>Rest assured, my administration</i>
<i>is taking steps</i>

10
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:01,580
<i>to ensure our way</i>
<i>of life will continue.</i>

11
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,953
<i>Mr. President, is</i>
<i>that last statement</i>

12
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,454
<i>connected to the rumors</i>

13
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,423
<i>of these so-called</i>
<i>"Noah's Ark" facilities?</i>

14
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,959
<i>We're hearing reports</i>
<i>of scientists,</i>

15
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,762
<i>engineers, doctors being</i>
<i>whisked away in the night.</i>

16
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:20,532
<i>Is the government hiding these</i>
<i>people in underground shelters?</i>

17
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,968
<i>We have a number</i>
<i>of contingency plans</i>

18
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,571
<i>in place, mainly to provide</i>
<i>peace of mind.</i>

19
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,906
<i>But let me be very clear.</i>

20
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:32,211
<i>Our priority is the safety</i>
<i>of all the American people.</i>

21
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,813
<i>Sir, are we facing</i>
<i>an impending catastrophe?</i>

22
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:38,450
<i>Is the government deciding</i>
<i>who lives and who dies?</i>

23
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:42,120
<i>Plenty of words from this</i>
<i>president but very few details.</i>

24
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,923
<i>And as more time passes</i>
<i>with no clear answers</i>

25
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,559
<i>the situation</i>
<i>becomes more dire.</i>

26
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,896
<i>This is Natalie reporting,</i>
<i>Channel Nine News.</i>

27
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,125
You having a nightmare, buddy?

28
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:38,063
Just let me out. Let me out.

29
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,732
Please.

30
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,271
Goddamn it, Bauer!

31
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,540
Gotta loosen the arm.

32
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,275
Please quit playing around.
Let me up.

33
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:54,079
Can't do that.

34
00:06:54,081 --> 00:07:00,252
Gradual transition to a normal
air mixture prevents what?

35
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,521
Oxygen toxicity.

36
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,723
Which can harm which organs?

37
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,693
Eyes, brain and...

38
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,631
and lungs!

39
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:30,048
You'd think that somebody
that just slept six months

40
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,950
would be in a better mood.

41
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:35,220
Why does my tank's cycle take
twice as long as yours?

42
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,056
Well, give it enough time,

43
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,659
everything in this dump's
gonna break.

44
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,134
- Did you clock in?
- No.

45
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,016
Oh, come on.

46
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,042
I just don't want the other
facilities to think we're...

47
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:01,112
What, dead? Come on. You can say
it. It's not gonna kill you.

48
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,551
How's the weather up there?

49
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,521
Nice day for a picnic?

50
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:12,991
Outside air toxicity's
still in the red.

51
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,461
Just like last cycle
and the cycle before that.

52
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:19,297
I don't know why
you check anymore.

53
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:22,033
All the other
facilities have checked in.

54
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,637
Everyone's okay.

55
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,205
Thank my lucky stars.

56
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,914
Oh, not this again, buddy.

57
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,749
No, just a minute.
I have an idea.

58
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,885
How many times
are you gonna do this?

59
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,657
This piece of crap
network wasn't set up...

60
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,494
For direct communication.
Yeah, I get it.

61
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:52,264
Yeah, I wish
I had the Internet.

62
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,769
Maybe they'll be better prepared
for the next Apocalypse.

63
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:04,242
Better use the bathroom first,
buddy, if you know what I mean.

64
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,895
Hey, this is not funny.

65
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,864
You don't think it's true?

66
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,800
What isn't true?
They're all dead.

67
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,538
You don't need to remind me.

68
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,920
Today's shopping list.

69
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,294
Look at this.

70
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:59,631
Man, I've seen that a million
times. I got it memorized.

71
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:03,635
No, no, no, it says there was
some kind of seismic activity.

72
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:06,071
What? Yeah, an earthquake.

73
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:09,074
I know what seismic means.
What does it say?

74
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,777
Oh, this is not good.

75
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,914
Look, if there's any sort of
leak down here at all,

76
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,249
this place would be full of
poison air from outside.

77
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,852
We'd be dead. What else?

78
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,557
Electrical systems,
core structural inspection.

79
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,159
Core structural inspection?

80
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:32,464
That's a joke. This is
an abandoned missile silo.

81
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:36,901
What about the tanks?
Individual unit diagnostics.

82
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,237
No way. Unbelievable.

83
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,173
You know what? I'll do
everything else if you do that.

84
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,542
Those sleepers, yuck,
you know they creep me out.

85
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,778
No. Come on.

86
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,080
It's your turn this time.

87
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,682
On three?

88
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,588
One, two, three.

89
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,891
Clock's ticking. Chop, chop.

90
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,187
Doesn't he drive you nuts?

91
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,158
I've gotten used to him.

92
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,300
I've been dreaming of you.

93
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,471
<i>How's the diagnostics, buddy?</i>

94
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,638
<i>Filter checks are good</i>
<i>on all nine levels.</i>

95
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,675
<i>No damage at all</i>
<i>from that seismic activity.</i>

96
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:08,446
<i>What about the tanks?</i>
Still working on them.

97
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,253
Did you tell him about us?

98
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,365
I'm waiting for the right time.

99
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,637
You made a promise.

100
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,574
I'll tell him.

101
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,576
<i>Tell me what?</i>

102
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,983
<i>Who are you talking to?</i> Nobody.

103
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:53,291
I hate it when you do that.
Yeah.

104
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:57,128
I hate when you talk to
the sleepers. I find it creepy.

105
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,696
They're just people.

106
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:02,300
Yeah, you standing over them,
staring at them.

107
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:06,004
What does that make you?
Sort of a weird pervert?

108
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:09,607
Look who's talking.
The chronic masturbator.

109
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:13,177
Well, at least I ain't diddling
some dead girl, huh?

110
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,314
She's not dead.
She's waiting, like we are.

111
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:21,386
Hey, don't you compare her to
me. I work for a living.

112
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,855
What do they do?

113
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:27,058
Come on, you know they're
important.

114
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,994
Important, huh?

115
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:33,932
What, this guy right here?
"Herpetology."

116
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,935
What's that? Some herpes
specialist?

117
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,070
Reptiles and amphibians.

118
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,638
Heh. You're a genius.

119
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,775
These people are seeds, Bauer.

120
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,243
The last in the world.

121
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,111
Knowledge and experience
that's unique...

122
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,381
Unique and irreplaceable.
Blah, blah, blah...

123
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,823
You sound like
a broken record, man.

124
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,287
They're the future.
Have some respect.

125
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,757
Come on, buddy.
Don't give me that crap.

126
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,229
We waste our whole lives down
here, in this hole.

127
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,000
So they can survive?

128
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:42,133
- I understand how you feel.
- Doesn't it mean anything to you?

129
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,334
Working down here? Saving...

130
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,303
Saving the future of humanity?

131
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,438
Come on. Wake up,
push a button,

132
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,141
change a light bulb,
go back to sleep.

133
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,310
Rinse and repeat, buddy.

134
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:53,945
Doesn't it bug you
just a little bit?

135
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:56,581
No.

136
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,816
Pfft.

137
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:02,020
You know we got the short end
of the stick down here, right?

138
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:06,557
What are you going to do about
it? Complain to management?

139
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,394
Yeah, I might.

140
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,916
I think I'll write a letter.

141
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,900
You do that.

142
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,737
<i>A gorgeous afternoon</i>
<i>for baseball.</i>

143
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,272
<i>And we do wanna</i>
<i>remind everybody</i>

144
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:23,441
<i>who's out here</i>
<i>enjoying the game</i>

145
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,443
<i>that these teams are</i>
<i>donating all the proceeds</i>

146
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:27,145
<i>of tonight's ticket sales</i>

147
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:31,182
<i>to the relief effort after</i>
<i>last week's bombing in Europe.</i>

148
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,718
<i>So we thank everybody</i>
<i>for their support</i>

149
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,353
<i>at this terrible time.</i>

150
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:38,990
"Probabilistic calculation of
Air Pollutant Dispersion."

151
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,358
Bingo.

152
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,627
What's that? Little light
reading for the crapper?

153
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:46,964
Hmm. "This equation can be used
to calculate time remaining"

154
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,966
until viable surface
re-habitation."

155
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,334
Ball two. Listen to this.

156
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,970
Pitcher's a little bit shaky.
Listen, listen.

157
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:56,541
"Parameters are,
cross wind dispersion

158
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,911
"concentration of pollutant,
horizontal deviation." Right?

159
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,346
Right? Listen to this.
You can almost see the homerun

160
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,781
in this guy's eyes right here.

161
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:07,351
"Optimal scenario for
re-habitation is 30 years.

162
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:11,222
But this figure may deviate
upwards of 150 years."

163
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:14,459
Did you hear that? Hmm?

164
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,394
You've watched
the game 100 times.

165
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:19,530
Here it comes, here it comes.

166
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:22,733
<i>And there it goes!</i>

167
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:27,638
I'm saying we might not be stuck
down here for much longer.

168
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,778
Yeah, just another hundred
years, right? Blink of an eye.

169
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,281
Says here it could be as little
as 20 more shifts.

170
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,750
Buddy, that's for
a weather forecast.

171
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:43,254
Which is 50 percent right
10 percent of the time.

172
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,791
But you just keep
on reading, all right?

173
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,794
<i>We interrupt your regularly</i>
<i>scheduled programming</i>

174
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,129
<i>to bring you this...</i>

175
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,764
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Heard it all before.

176
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,500
<i>We've just receive confirmation</i>

177
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,335
<i>of a series of explosions</i>
<i>around the world.</i>

178
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,003
Buddy, it's your move.

179
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,838
<i>Major cities such</i>
<i>as Munich, Tokyo,</i>

180
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,307
<i>London and Brisbane</i>
<i>were targeted.</i>

181
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,476
What's it gonna be,
Mr. Kasparov?

182
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,912
<i>Reports are coming from</i>
<i>reliable sources</i>

183
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,413
<i>from inside the government.</i>

184
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,315
May not be official, but...

185
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,884
<i>Now this isn't official,</i>

186
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,186
<i>but we're hearing</i>
<i>that these attacks could be</i>

187
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,521
<i>similar to the hybrid nuclear</i>

188
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,489
<i>and chemical weapon</i>
<i>that devastated.</i>

189
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,425
<i>Tel Aviv earlier this year.</i>

190
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:22,860
<i>The President has now raised.</i>

191
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,663
<i>U.S. military</i>
<i>readiness to DEFCON One.</i>

192
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,899
<i>Which is the highest</i>
<i>threat level</i>

193
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,767
<i>this country has ever been in.</i>

194
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,374
There you go.

195
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,577
You got six more months
to regret that move.

196
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,748
Wait. I thought
we had more time.

197
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,718
Nope. Like sand through
the hourglass.

198
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,755
You check these diagnostics?
Yeah, yeah.

199
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:54,725
Just about to make
our sleep cocktails.

200
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:59,497
Good. I got a date
with Miss 1979.

201
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,916
Back to sleep?

202
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,353
That's the routine.

203
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,793
We'll be together soon.

204
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,652
There's nothing to be afraid of.

205
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,790
I tell myself that every time.

206
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,463
My brain knows it.

207
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:13,798
But my body tells me

208
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,468
that I'm about to climb
into a high-tech coffin.

209
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,472
Have you forgotten already?

210
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:24,508
Please, Abby,
I've got work to do.

211
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:31,382
Think of how good it
would feel to touch me.

212
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,401
Oh, no, no, no...!

213
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:54,171
Bauer! Bauer! Open the door!

214
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:55,406
What the fuck?

215
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,208
I need the fire
extinguisher, please!

216
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,442
Not a good time, buddy!

217
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,144
Open the door! Come on!

218
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:03,681
I need the fire extinguisher!
There's a fire!

219
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,954
You didn't have
to rip it apart.

220
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:21,165
Yeah, well, I thought
it would help.

221
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,767
That's not right.

222
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:25,836
Hey, you were responsible
for checking the diagnostics!

223
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,973
Hey, you hurt?

224
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,278
Let me see it. No.

225
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,720
Oh, come on. Stop being a baby.

226
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,617
How'd you get that?

227
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,185
From your stupid tank.

228
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:46,690
How am I supposed to
take care of myself now?

229
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:50,895
Use the other hand.
What if I need two hands?

230
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:57,902
Shit, we're out of air.

231
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,243
I don't know what
we're breathing.

232
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:08,646
There's not much left of it.

233
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:11,048
Come on, what does
that thing say?

234
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,050
One second, one second.

235
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:19,256
Bingo. "Emergency release
via Safety Reserve Cylinders."

236
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,826
Here, let me see.

237
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:25,062
Aah. You're gonna love this.

238
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:28,299
Looks like we gotta go up
the Airway Routing Chamber.

239
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,442
Come on, it's not any harder
than getting in your tank.

240
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,144
Exactly.

241
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:02,166
Did the book say where it is?

242
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,735
Somewhere in
this jury-rigged operation.

243
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:06,937
Why don't you check over there?

244
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:28,692
Wait, did you say red valve?

245
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:32,196
No, don't touch that one.

246
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,164
Red's the air outside.

247
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,369
Hey.

248
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,938
Found it, over here.

249
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,376
Emergency air and power supply.

250
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,087
Yeah, here.

251
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,397
Is it working?

252
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:09,333
Shh. Shut up, man.

253
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,202
Save your air.

254
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,250
It's not working.

255
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,853
Still nothing.

256
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,676
I had a wife. What?

257
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,144
Mm-hm.

258
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,415
Three little girls.

259
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:03,253
I thought "unmarried" was
one of the job requirements.

260
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,989
I lied.

261
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,193
To get the job, you know.

262
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,733
Who knew all this end-of-the
world shit was real?

263
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,238
Before they locked the doors.

264
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:32,116
Can you imagine what it was
like for them up there?

265
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,286
I'm sorry.

266
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,125
I had about a minute.

267
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:44,061
I could've gone up,
been with them.

268
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:48,766
And they sealed us in.

269
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,937
There's nothing
you could have done.

270
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,445
You don't understand.
You don't have a family.

271
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,418
I can imagine.

272
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,221
No, you can't.

273
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,429
It's just you and me now.

274
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,333
We're a family.

275
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,951
Reserved air just kicked in.

276
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,893
Time to make our next move.

277
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,131
Let's go, clock's ticking.

278
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,337
Where the hell are they?

279
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,242
It doesn't say.

280
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:08,812
Maybe you're looking in the
wrong section or something.

281
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:10,247
"Deep Sleep Vessel,

282
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,016
"Service and Replacement
Instruction," right here.

283
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:15,853
Man, I told you this
is a half-ass operation.

284
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:19,356
They don't even
have spare parts for us.

285
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:22,126
No, the parts are down here
somewhere. They have to be.

286
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:23,827
You see, this is
what happens when

287
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:26,309
you slap things together
at the last minute!

288
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,404
This is not
the only storage room.

289
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,048
Man, I know every
inch of this place.

290
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,284
This blueprint isn't
gonna help you.

291
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,357
Long-term storage.

292
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,126
It's just a load of crap
for when the sleepers wake up.

293
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,929
We're not maintaining that area.

294
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,864
What are those numbers for?

295
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:02,966
I don't know.

296
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,403
It should be safe, right?

297
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:09,940
It should be,
it's within the main seal.

298
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:13,043
The only reason it's blocked
off is to save oxygen.

299
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,813
I bet the spare parts
are in there.

300
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:27,891
All right.

301
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,167
No second chances.

302
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,293
All right.

303
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,943
This place is creepy.

304
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,578
It's like a cave or something.

305
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,213
Stop.

306
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,318
Scared, buddy?

307
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,588
Just feeling a little
claustrophobic, that's all.

308
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,530
Cut it out. Cut it out!

309
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,304
What was that?

310
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:48,906
Maybe it's an animal
or something.

311
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,240
How?

312
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,909
There hasn't been
any oxygen in here.

313
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:54,945
Oh, yeah, you're right.

314
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,218
Come on, let's try
this door right here.

315
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,593
Come on.

316
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,627
Hey, Bauer, what's this?

317
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:46,530
That's a Jacuzzi.
What's it look like?

318
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:49,166
What are these cameras for?

319
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:51,435
They don't show up
on our monitors.

320
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:57,407
That's the old security system.
Watch out for Commies.

321
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,377
Do you think any
of these still work?

322
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:07,250
No. There's nothing here.
Let's motor.

323
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:24,067
I'll start over here.
All right.

324
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:49,026
All right, bingo.
Someone's record collection.

325
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,241
Abby, Abby, Abby.

326
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:25,062
Bauer! I found it!

327
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,732
I found it.

328
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,634
Oh, yeah.

329
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,652
All right, I think it's ready.

330
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:51,721
What do you mean, think?
I'm ready for bed.

331
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:54,791
I should go in first,
just in case something happens.

332
00:34:56,327 --> 00:35:00,197
Nothing's gonna happen.
We did it.

333
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,632
Did we? Yeah.

334
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:07,938
Jump in. Gotta get
back on the horse.

335
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,475
Let me just check
something. Just a minute.

336
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,613
Fine.

337
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:20,016
I'll pinch hit. You run
the diagnostics.

338
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:23,086
No, I should do it. It's my
tank. I should go in first.

339
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:26,756
The sooner we do this,
the sooner we get some sleep.

340
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:29,860
Sure about this? Yep.

341
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,167
If anything seems off,
just give a sign.

342
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:40,036
Zip me up. Okay.

343
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:42,506
Ready? Yeah.

344
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,866
Hey!

345
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:17,774
Yeah, what? You hear that?

346
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:24,114
I don't hear anything.
Sounds like a leak.

347
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:26,950
Really? Yeah.

348
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,691
And the air is definitely
getting thinner in here.

349
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:44,167
You sure? Yeah.

350
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:48,271
Check the air pump.
Okay, let me check.

351
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,383
Cartwright?

352
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,154
Hey, let me out of here.
I'll check it.

353
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:06,289
I'll check it myself.

354
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,830
Cartwright!

355
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,368
Cartwright!

356
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,240
Cartwright!

357
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:19,529
Bauer!

358
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,375
I'm so sorry.

359
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:42,752
My God, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay? You okay?

360
00:38:57,234 --> 00:39:00,070
Where were you?
I was calling your name!

361
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:02,672
I was right here!

362
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,275
What happened?
I couldn't get the tank open!

363
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:07,110
So I was looking
for something to cut it.

364
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:08,745
What took you so long?

365
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:09,813
I just told you.

366
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:12,056
The box cutter,
I couldn't find it!

367
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:20,290
What happened to the tank?
I don't know.

368
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:22,459
Maybe I missed something.

369
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:28,732
You missed something.
It was an accident.

370
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,867
It would've been
so convenient for you, huh?

371
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:35,238
One tank between the two of us.

372
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,641
All your problems solved.
That's crazy! It's my tank!

373
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:42,679
I was supposed to be in there!
But you insisted.

374
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:46,416
Did I? Yes, you did, remember?

375
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,086
Remember?

376
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,527
I did. You're right.

377
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:10,974
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

378
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:20,984
This might be a stupid question,
do we have parts for that?

379
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:22,752
I don't know.

380
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,956
And that's all
the reserve air we got.

381
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,797
All right, change of plans.

382
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,137
All right.

383
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,241
Which one looks good?

384
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,976
Good for what?

385
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,114
All right, maybe not that one.

386
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:55,452
What about this guy right here?
"Ichthyology."

387
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:58,621
I don't even know
what that means.

388
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,858
We can't just open one of the
tanks and put me inside.

389
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,960
Yeah, why not?

390
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,496
What about the person
who's already in the tank?

391
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:09,032
What happens to him
when we pull him out?

392
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:12,435
Well, I guess we kill him.
What?

393
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:16,172
The only reason why we're here
is to keep these people alive.

394
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:19,609
They're the last remnants
of human civilization.

395
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:21,211
Fuck them.

396
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,850
We can't just decide
who lives and who dies!

397
00:41:26,852 --> 00:41:30,453
You know what we can do?
Take care of ourselves.

398
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:33,723
No, you know what?
Take care of each other.

399
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:35,558
That's what families do.

400
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:40,597
Now, you need to
pick one right now.

401
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,208
All right.

402
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,211
All right.

403
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:07,790
Morphine, good idea.
Ticket to paradise.

404
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:10,660
Give him a heavy dose
while he's still inside.

405
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,801
Don't do this.

406
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,972
What choice do I have?

407
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:27,377
There's another way.
We don't have time.

408
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:31,748
It's as simple as ABC.

409
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:40,723
Hey, what's the matter
with you?

410
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:50,366
I can't do this. Yes, you can.

411
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:53,636
No, I'm not doing this.

412
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:55,872
Fine. Give me the needle,
I'll do it myself.

413
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:59,275
Listen, listen, listen,
there's another way.

414
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:02,679
Look, I know this breaks
your soft little heart...

415
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:04,614
but sometimes
you've gotta sacrifice a pawn

416
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:06,149
to stay in the game.

417
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:09,686
Don't let him.
I said, I'm not doing this.

418
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:12,155
Don't you wanna live?
It's murder.

419
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:13,990
We're techs, Bauer,
not murderers!

420
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:15,458
Come on.

421
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,761
What happens if they find out
through the next facilities?

422
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:22,131
Take a look around, man.
We're the only ones here!

423
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:28,237
It's not murder, it's survival.

424
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,977
Listen, we have an obligation
to keep these people alive.

425
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:39,949
You're a piece of work,
man, you know that?

426
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,021
Did you feel that?

427
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,623
That's what
it's going to feel like

428
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:48,057
when the air runs
out down here.

429
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:51,127
Your lungs starving for oxygen
and there isn't any.

430
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,764
Look, someone's gonna die,
I'm sorry.

431
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:58,101
But you are not
leaving me here alone.

432
00:43:58,103 --> 00:44:01,270
Please, don't do it.

433
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,040
You'll thank me later.

434
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,765
That's enough.
What are you gonna do with that?

435
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:34,937
You gonna stab me with it?
Go ahead, cut my throat.

436
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:36,706
Solve all your problems.
Listen.

437
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:39,876
Try to save a guy's life and
he kicks you right in the nuts.

438
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:42,278
You don't understand. Listen.
No, you don't understand.

439
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,914
These people, they got
their ticket to the future

440
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:47,750
by stepping on people
like you and me!

441
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:50,386
You wanna trade your life
for one of theirs?

442
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,057
I told you, I have an idea.

443
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:56,759
Now are you with me or what?

444
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:01,898
Yeah. Yeah, I'm with you.

445
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:09,372
What are friends for, right?

446
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:17,180
Man, I don't know.

447
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:19,482
But the codes match.

448
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:22,018
ABC 108 here.

449
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:25,321
And ABC 108.

450
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:27,457
I'm telling you,
there's another facility,

451
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:30,660
right here, next to us.

452
00:45:30,662 --> 00:45:32,595
Maybe. Come on.

453
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:33,963
It's too dangerous, man.

454
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:36,299
We don't even know
what's out there.

455
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:39,469
They checked in.
Look at the monitor.

456
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:43,172
There are people in that
facility with spare parts.

457
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,876
You're gonna have to break
the red seal.

458
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:50,012
Okay. It's a risk.
It's a huge risk.

459
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:52,281
This facility's
a fragile bubble.

460
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:53,916
One wrong thing and
this whole place

461
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,285
fills up full
of contaminated air.

462
00:45:56,287 --> 00:46:00,456
Then instead of just killing
one of them, we all die.

463
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:03,259
We'll just have to make
sure nothing happens.

464
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,491
Can you hear me?

465
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:42,865
All right.

466
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,242
Bauer...

467
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:55,511
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hugs and kisses.

468
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:58,414
Good luck, all that.

469
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:19,168
Oh, shit!

470
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,671
<i>What? What is it?</i>

471
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:24,473
A dead body. A soldier.

472
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,276
<i>Ours or theirs?</i>

473
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,279
I can't tell.

474
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:33,115
Lucky he didn't shoot out
the airlock door.

475
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,154
Better luck in the next life.

476
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:41,224
<i>Come on, buddy,</i>
<i>you're wasting air.</i>

477
00:47:41,226 --> 00:47:43,893
I'm waiting on the air filters.

478
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:46,963
Okay.

479
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:53,936
Wish me luck.

480
00:47:53,938 --> 00:47:56,305
<i>Good luck.</i>

481
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:58,040
Okay.

482
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:46,989
<i>Find anything good out there?</i>

483
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:51,761
Just dust. Blue dust.
It's everywhere.

484
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:54,563
<i>Yeah, that's</i>
<i>the airborne contaminant.</i>

485
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:02,271
<i>You got 31 minutes left, buddy.</i>

486
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,408
<i>If you're not back soon,</i>
<i>I'll see you in six months.</i>

487
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,484
<i>Trying to move people</i>
<i>as quickly as possible,</i>

488
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:19,055
<i>but there are rumors that these</i>
<i>public shelters are not safe</i>

489
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:20,723
<i>against these chemical weapons.</i>

490
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:54,123
<i>Oh, hey. I got you.</i>

491
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,727
<i>Yeah, I see you</i>
<i>on one of the monitors.</i>

492
00:49:57,729 --> 00:49:59,862
You're right,
those old cameras still work.

493
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:01,297
Give me a thumbs-up.

494
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:07,570
All right, cool, keep moving.

495
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:09,372
All right,
I'm just trying to figure out

496
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:11,774
where the hell you're going.

497
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,383
I think I've found it.

498
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:31,454
Oh, you were right.

499
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,338
It's stuck.

500
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,311
<i>Come on, you big sissy.</i>
<i>Give it a push.</i>

501
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:05,588
I'm in.

502
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:09,458
All right, say hi
to the ABC people for me.

503
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:16,499
<i>Bauer?</i> Yeah.

504
00:52:16,501 --> 00:52:19,368
<i>I think we got a problem.</i>

505
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,905
It's not working.

506
00:52:22,907 --> 00:52:25,307
<i>Did the green light come on?</i>

507
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:29,678
No, nothing's working.

508
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,681
<i>Looks like you're locked out,</i>
<i>buddy.</i>

509
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:36,886
Hello! Hey!

510
00:52:36,888 --> 00:52:39,488
<i>Hey, stop, stop.</i>
<i>You're wasting air.</i>

511
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,358
Well, I was hoping
somebody could hear me.

512
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:47,396
Oh shit. What do we do now?

513
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:50,399
<i>Sit tight, buddy.</i>
<i>I'm working on it.</i>

514
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,383
Don't give up.

515
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:13,589
What if he's right?
What if there's no future?

516
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:16,225
You've always
found a way for us.

517
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:21,330
I'd lose my mind without you.

518
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:26,602
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

519
00:53:26,604 --> 00:53:29,872
<i>I think I found a way around it</i>
<i>but you're not gonna like it.</i>

520
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:31,473
Just tell me.

521
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:34,476
Back the way you came,
about ten yards.

522
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:36,545
<i>What am I looking for?</i>

523
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,881
You'll know it when you see it.

524
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,047
You're joking.

525
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:14,016
<i>Nope.</i>

526
00:54:14,018 --> 00:54:15,551
There's no room up there.

527
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:17,052
<i>Come on, buddy,</i>
<i>I've crawled through</i>

528
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:19,255
<i>the exact same air ducts</i>
<i>in our place.</i>

529
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:22,324
If I can do it, you can do it.

530
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,931
Is there any other way?

531
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:33,269
<i>Well, if you want those guys to</i>
<i>help you, that's your way in.</i>

532
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:41,410
<i>Come on, it's a good way</i>
<i>to cure your claustrophobia.</i>

533
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:45,981
All right. I'm going in.

534
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:34,997
I'm coming to an intersection.
Which way?

535
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:36,899
<i>Left takes you back here,</i>
<i>so go right,</i>

536
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:40,102
<i>right into their main</i>
<i>ventilation system.</i>

537
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:07,796
<i>You okay, buddy?</i>

538
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:09,598
Yeah.

539
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:15,738
This place
is full of dead people.

540
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,272
<i>Which way are they headed?</i>

541
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:20,008
<i>Are they facing the same</i>
<i>direction you're going?</i>

542
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,378
I can't tell.

543
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,113
The good news is,
they didn't break in.

544
00:56:24,115 --> 00:56:26,982
<i>What?</i>

545
00:56:26,984 --> 00:56:28,117
If they died out there,

546
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:30,753
then the main ventilation system
is still sealed.

547
00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:44,967
<i>Hey, you do not want</i>
<i>to throw up in your mask.</i>

548
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,140
Thanks for the advice.

549
00:56:51,142 --> 00:56:55,144
<i>I got another idea.</i>
<i>You can take your helmet off,</i>

550
00:56:55,146 --> 00:56:58,447
<i>join that little yard sale</i>
<i>they got going on down there.</i>

551
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:00,783
Go to hell, Bauer.

552
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:05,387
<i>Bauer...</i>

553
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:08,157
<i>the main filter?</i>

554
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:11,160
What? You're breaking up.

555
00:57:11,162 --> 00:57:15,230
<i>I said, can I bypass</i>
<i>the main filter unit?</i>

556
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:16,532
Yes.

557
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:18,300
<i>Answer me.</i>

558
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:20,803
Yes!

559
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:23,972
Look, I'm gonna try to boost
our radio signal.

560
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:29,878
Don't worry about it.
I'll be right here.

561
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,146
<i>Bauer.</i>

562
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,190
Answer me.

563
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:49,758
Hey, Bauer, are you there?

564
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,900
<i>Bauer, are you there?</i>

565
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:01,837
Yeah, I'm here.

566
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,307
<i>I'm at the filter bypass.</i>

567
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:14,650
<i>Hey, Bauer...</i>

568
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:18,353
<i>Do you hear me?</i>
<i>I'm almost through.</i>

569
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:20,689
Good for you, buddy.

570
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:32,267
<i>Wait, something's not right.</i>

571
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,803
You're telling me.

572
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:32,681
This must have happened
a long time ago.

573
01:02:32,683 --> 01:02:34,983
<i>You're breaking up.</i>

574
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,831
They're all...

575
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:09,651
They're all...

576
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:11,520
dead.

577
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:45,220
Unique and irreplaceable.

578
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:04,039
They were checked in today,
ABC 108.

579
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:08,443
They checked in today
and every other time.

580
01:04:08,445 --> 01:04:11,646
We saw it on the system.

581
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:17,252
<i>Do you hear me, Bauer?</i>
<i>I saw it with my own eyes.</i>

582
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:19,688
It's a lie.

583
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,957
<i>The whole system?</i>

584
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,429
All of it.

585
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:29,331
It's a lie.

586
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:38,306
Can't trust anyone anymore.

587
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:31,559
My God, Bauer.

588
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:35,931
There's no network.

589
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:38,600
No connection
to other facilities.

590
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:46,541
Just us and some computer
telling us that we're not alone.

591
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,445
You're not alone, my love.

592
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:55,684
It's designed to keep us
from losing our minds.

593
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:02,090
<i>Bauer, are you there?</i>

594
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,026
Where else would I be?

595
01:06:05,028 --> 01:06:07,629
<i>If the system is a lie,</i>
<i>automated,</i>

596
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:10,498
how do we know if there's
anyone else out there?

597
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,700
We don't.

598
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:20,508
We don't know anything.

599
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:55,510
We might be
the only ones left alive.

600
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:00,148
My God.

601
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:26,641
I'm running low on air.

602
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:29,577
I'm on my way back.

603
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:31,546
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

604
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:15,990
As you always say,

605
01:08:15,992 --> 01:08:20,095
"Give it enough time,
everything's gonna break."

606
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,846
Guess where I found this?

607
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:44,619
I don't know, where?

608
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:47,856
<i>In the toolbox, where I put it.</i>

609
01:08:47,858 --> 01:08:50,191
<i>And I remember</i>
<i>putting the toolbox,</i>

610
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:55,130
right next to your sleep tank,
within easy reach.

611
01:08:55,998 --> 01:08:57,465
<i>Okay, so what is your point?</i>

612
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,987
Yeah, I couldn't
believe it either,

613
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:03,505
<i>so I checked</i>
<i>the video recording.</i>

614
01:09:03,507 --> 01:09:06,040
<i>Just a minute,</i>
<i>let's talk about this.</i>

615
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:07,475
Don't bother.

616
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:14,549
<i>You should see</i>
<i>the look on your face.</i>

617
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:17,318
You going nuts, buddy?

618
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,654
Or did you really
try to kill me?

619
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:22,824
Just let me in.
We can talk about it.

620
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:27,529
Let you in? You have gone nuts.
No, you're a danger to me.

621
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:29,497
You're a danger
to the sleepers.

622
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:31,699
You're a danger
to this whole facility.

623
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:33,234
<i>Bauer, please.</i>

624
01:09:33,236 --> 01:09:36,137
It's not like I'm mad at you.

625
01:09:36,139 --> 01:09:38,439
No, I take it back.
I'm pretty mad at you.

626
01:09:38,441 --> 01:09:41,543
Give me a chance
to explain what happened.

627
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:45,547
No second chances.

628
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:49,751
Think of it as a mercy killing,

629
01:09:49,753 --> 01:09:52,453
like I should have done
with my family.

630
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,693
Nice chatting with you, buddy.

631
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:07,735
Where you gonna go?
You've got no air!

632
01:10:31,861 --> 01:10:33,695
I'm here.

633
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,269
Where am I going, Abby?
Breathe.

634
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,976
Just look.

635
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,700
<i>You know what hurts the most?</i>

636
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:19,307
<i>The betrayal and the lies.</i>

637
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:27,048
<i>I trusted you.</i>
<i>And you turned your back on me?</i>

638
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:39,360
<i>Look, there's nothing out</i>
<i>there.</i>

639
01:11:39,362 --> 01:11:40,795
<i>There's nowhere to go.</i>

640
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,565
<i>Why don't you come back here?</i>

641
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,779
<i>How does it feel,</i>

642
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:59,861
<i>knowing you're gonna die</i>
<i>out there, huh?</i>

643
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:20,068
Answer me!

644
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:33,948
Ugh!

645
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:17,759
I made it, Abby.
Everything's gonna be okay.

646
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:20,795
Everything's gonna be okay.

647
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,620
Cartwright?

648
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:53,027
Did I get you?

649
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:23,758
Vincent Bauer,
you don't have to do this.

650
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,993
We might be
the only ones left alive.

651
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:28,162
Yeah?

652
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:31,666
Is that what you were thinking
when I was laying there dying?

653
01:14:31,668 --> 01:14:34,702
When you were looking
at your little photo?

654
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:38,039
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

655
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:42,043
Yeah, we both did.

656
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:51,953
All right, enough of this
cat and mouse crap.

657
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:05,933
You know I can't
let this go, right?

658
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:14,041
Go lay back down in my tank,

659
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:17,545
see if my best friend's gonna
kill me in my sleep?

660
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:58,019
Cartwright! Don't make me hunt
you like a goddamn animal!

661
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:24,345
If you don't do this,
he'll kill you.

662
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:30,618
It'll be quick.
It'll be painless.

663
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,655
You have to do this for us.

664
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:11,752
You know how much
this hurts me? Huh?

665
01:18:11,754 --> 01:18:14,155
We're supposed to be family!

666
01:18:14,157 --> 01:18:16,490
Family! Yes, she needs me!

667
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:18,626
Look, look! Goddamn it!

668
01:18:18,628 --> 01:18:20,828
She does. I promised her.

669
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:22,963
Look, look, listen,
I can explain everything.

670
01:18:22,965 --> 01:18:24,165
Look, please understand.

671
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:26,734
Please, she needs me.
I promised!

672
01:18:26,736 --> 01:18:29,270
Abby, honey,
I promise I'll never leave you.

673
01:18:29,272 --> 01:18:31,539
I promised I'd never leave you.
Who are you talking to?

674
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:33,908
I'll never leave you, Abby.
Who are you talking to?

675
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,476
I'm sorry, Abby!
There's nobody here!

676
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:39,213
I'll never leave you, I'm sorry!
Nobody here!

677
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,467
Son of a bitch.

678
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:39,273
Cartwright?

679
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:44,211
I know you're in here, buddy.

680
01:19:56,658 --> 01:19:58,926
You think I'm stupid?

681
01:20:00,662 --> 01:20:03,063
Think I wouldn't figure it out?

682
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:13,541
At least now I know
why this stupid job

683
01:20:13,543 --> 01:20:15,476
is so important to you.

684
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:26,453
She was here all along, huh?

685
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:33,294
Your lovely wife?

686
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:43,437
You didn't want to decide
who lives and who dies?

687
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:49,476
Well, that's what it's come to.

688
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:13,567
Cartwright.

689
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:19,306
Come out here right now,
we'll end this.

690
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:27,081
I'll kill her.

691
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:30,551
You don't think I'll do it?

692
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:36,156
I'll punch a hole
right between her eyes.

693
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:39,393
Ugh!

694
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:17,031
You should see the look
on your face right now.

695
01:22:22,904 --> 01:22:26,006
My ticket to paradise, huh?

696
01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:50,664
Come on, man. No, no, no.

697
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:55,069
Take care of your girl.

698
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:59,440
Go on, man.
The clock's ticking.

699
01:23:57,432 --> 01:23:59,800
<i>I'm alive, Abby.</i>

700
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:05,773
<i>But it's just me now.</i>

701
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:11,712
<i>Keeping this place functional.</i>

702
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:17,618
<i>Talking to myself.</i>

703
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:26,126
<i>Sleeping in the bed</i>
<i>of the man I killed.</i>

704
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:56,223
<i>Just me now.</i>

705
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,095
<i>And time.</i>

706
01:28:28,036 --> 01:28:29,803
Abby.
