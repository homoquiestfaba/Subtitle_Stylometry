1
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,865
Why don't you go inside, Jonathan?
I'll park the car and meet you there.

2
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:29,643
Can I help you?

3
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:33,745
I think I need to register?
I just transferred here.

4
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,881
I'm curious, Jonathan.

5
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,457
Did you dress like this
when your father was alive?

6
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,591
Like what?

7
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,363
No, he didn't dress like this back then.

8
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,695
That was three years ago, Mom.

9
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:50,246
I'm not going to dress the same
way I did when I was thirteen.

10
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,902
I was just answering the question.

11
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,428
You bought me this shirt.

12
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,066
Well, it is a cool shirt.

13
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,202
And the earrings.

14
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:03,249
Jonathan, all your tests indicate
you're a very smart young man

15
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,617
but I've been looking over
your transcripts from Portsmouth,

16
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,987
and your grades have been declining
since your father passed on.

17
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,454
- Ms. Blackhead.
- Whitehead.

18
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:15,223
We were both in pretty rough shape
after Bill died.

19
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:16,559
She was a wreck.

20
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:17,927
Thank you. Frankly,

21
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,195
I would have been more surprised
if Jonathan's grades hadn't suffered.

22
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,565
I understand.

23
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:28,200
My concern is that Jonathan's appearance
seems to indicate that he might be...

24
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,806
Suicidal?

25
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,209
Depressed.

26
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,845
No. I'm fine.

27
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,608
We're both fine.

28
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,878
We just needed something
a little different.

29
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,750
And this sure is different.

30
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,621
That's the bell for second period.

31
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,255
Jonathan, why don't you head to class
while I talk to your Mom.

32
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:54,632
Here's your schedule
You've got American History right now.

33
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:59,605
That's just down the hall. Room 27.
Mr. Allen knows to expect you.

34
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,008
Have a great day, honey.
See you at home, okay?

35
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:02,672
Okay.

36
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,444
I understand you're the new
assistant librarian.

37
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,503
That's right.

38
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,708
You'll like working with Mrs. Henniker.

39
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:13,846
She's been running that place
since I was in high school.

40
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,338
What the fuck? Is it Halloween already?

41
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:42,982
At that time,

42
00:04:43,006 --> 00:04:47,006
New England was as heavily involved
in the slave trade as the Southern states.

43
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:52,458
Some of the more prosperous families
in Dunkirk, in fact, gained their wealth

44
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,826
from the transport of slaves up and down
the Eastern coast.

45
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,956
But we mustn't judge them too harshly.

46
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:03,027
This was considered to be
a respectable enterprise, in those days.

47
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,935
"Set's Lament."

48
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,872
May I?

49
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,471
"How beautiful you were, Osiris,
My brother, My king."

50
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:19,474
"How I adored you,
My lover, My king."

51
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,819
"Had I not killed you,
You could never have tasted Death."

52
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:26,156
"Had I not rended you,
You could never have been reborn."

53
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:30,562
- "Had I not," - what's this?
- "sacrificed you."

54
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,894
"You could never have become
what you are."

55
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:37,234
""Can you not see how much I loved you?"

56
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,865
An interesting re-interpretation
of mythology, Mr. Kelly.

57
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,545
But I'm not sure if the ancient
Egyptians would have approved

58
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,979
of Set calling Osiris his "lover."

59
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,378
Fag.

60
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,443
I liked it.

61
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,856
Now, where were we?

62
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:04,126
Slaves were of course not the only
commodity traded along the seacoast.

63
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,997
Sugar, salt and other cooking spices

64
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:12,904
were difficult for the colonists
to come by and fetched a fair price.

65
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,609
Jonathan!

66
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,379
Did I get your name right?

67
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,415
Yes.

68
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,353
Allen likes to bully anyone
who isn't hanging on his every word.

69
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,048
But it was a nice poem.

70
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,524
Thanks. It wasn't finished yet.

71
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,650
My name's David.

72
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,023
Hi.

73
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,834
No, I'm not a Satanist. It's

74
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,031
I know what it is.

75
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:49,804
There's a coffee shop downtown.
Meet me there after school.

76
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,334
Hey! Go get us a table in the back.

77
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,135
I'll get us some coffee.
You like cream and sugar?

78
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,642
No. Thanks. Just black.

79
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,792
Hope you like dark roast.

80
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,923
That's fine. Thanks.

81
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,563
So, you're a witch, right?

82
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,478
Or are you just wearing that pentacle
because you think it's cool?

83
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:04,472
I don't do anything just to be cool.

84
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,021
Know what that is?

85
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,588
'The Grimoire of Armadel.'
It says so right on the cover.

86
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,657
No shit.
I mean, do you know anything about it?

87
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,793
I know it's crap.

88
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,314
There were a ton of fake grimoires
popping up all over Europe

89
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,567
during the witch craze.

90
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:30,372
Most of this is ripped off
from older works.

91
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,435
You knew that.

92
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,441
Sure. But until today, I was the only
one in this fuckin' town who knew it.

93
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,817
This is a first printing
of the Mathers translation.

94
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,583
It must be worth a fortune!

95
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,488
A couple hundred bucks, at least.

96
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,960
There's an antiques dealer in town
who has a few of these kicking around.

97
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,894
He lets me borrow one now and again.

98
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,226
Why?

99
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,029
He knows me.
He knows ['ll take care of them.

100
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:57,162
No, I mean,
"Why are you reading them?"

101
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,069
Why are you?

102
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,075
You aren't trying to summon a demon?

103
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,577
Well, I did try.

104
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:08,903
The incense gave me a
fuckin' headache, that was about it.

105
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,541
What about you?

106
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,814
I wasn't trying to summon demons...

107
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,683
You can do magic, though, can't you?

108
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,818
Some. Nothing much.

109
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,955
Like what?

110
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:26,990
I cast some spells - to pass a test,
or find something I've lost.

111
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,091
Stuff like that.

112
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,068
- And they work?
- I guess so.

113
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,934
How can you tell?

114
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:37,205
Even if you get what you want,
how do you know it's not coincidence?

115
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,337
<i>Well.. There's something else.</i>

116
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:43,211
Sometimes, I can sort of put thoughts
into people's minds.

117
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,741
Make them do something,
right at that moment,

118
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,776
they wouldn't have done normally.

119
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,755
That doesn't seem like coincidence.

120
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:53,419
Can you put a thought into my mind?

121
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,019
Yeah, whatever.

122
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:59,760
It doesn't work if
you're expecting me to do it.

123
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:21,676
You expect me to believe
you made her do that?

124
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,954
All right, you pick one.

125
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,294
That guy, make him drop his coffee.

126
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,633
What did he do to you?

127
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,503
Trust me, he's a dick.

128
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,491
I want you to teach me.

129
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,402
"Come and see what the mirror of fate
will show you."

130
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,401
'Vampire Circus' 1972.

131
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,928
Fuckin' Al.

132
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,533
All right. I've got one for you.

133
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:22,140
"Good and evil are so close, they
are chained together in the soul."

134
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,672
Come on.

135
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:24,916
I don't know that one.

136
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,149
That's because you watch
too many vampire movies.

137
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,621
I watch mummy movies, too.

138
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,020
You gotta broaden your horizons.

139
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,490
Well, what the fuck is the movie?

140
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,721
'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' 1941.

141
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,294
Hi, Jonathan. Who's your friend?

142
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,806
His name's David, uh...

143
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Ross.

144
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,440
Hi, David!

145
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,567
Hi, Mrs. Kelly.

146
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,170
Would you like to come inside?
I think we have some cake left.

147
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:57,446
No, thanks. I have to get going.
I'll see you tomorrow at school.

148
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,848
Sure.

149
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:05,423
See”? The first day,
and you're already making friends!

150
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,960
Aaron! I'm not gonna warn you again
about elbowing people!

151
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,272
The runt was in my way, Coach!!

152
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,296
That's enough!

153
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,130
You okay, Johnny? Good boy!

154
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,631
Foul on Aaron, free throw for Johnny.
Give me the ball?

155
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,503
Hey! Jonathan!

156
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,011
Where's the nearest bathroom?

157
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,044
Isn't there one in there?

158
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,604
I mean, one with doors on the stalls.

159
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:28,815
They don't have doors?

160
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,592
How long have you been going
to this school?

161
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:31,745
I've never been in there.

162
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,049
Haven't you ever been to gym?

163
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,086
Nope. Never.

164
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,320
How'd you wrangle that?

165
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,652
I've got a bad heart.

166
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,583
Really?

167
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:38,788
So my doctor says.

168
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:43,626
I've had it since birth
No sports or heavy exertion allowed.

169
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:46,860
Wish I had a bad heart.

170
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:52,497
In 1784, a ship called the Mariposa
arrived in Dunkirk Harbor.

171
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:58,267
It was transporting goods from Africa,
which included about 75 African slaves.

172
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:03,907
Unfortunately, one of the sailors on
board had - it's been surmised

173
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,510
contracted smallpox in their last port.

174
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,749
It spread rapidly throughout the crew.

175
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:14,352
Nearly four months later,
on a chill, foggy September morning,

176
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:17,364
the Mariposa drifted into Dunkirk Harbor,

177
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:21,425
where, like the Demeter
in Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula,

178
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,563
it crashed into the dock
with no one at the helm.

179
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,972
Some of the local men went aboard

180
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:32,069
and found a few of the crew still
alive, too weak to move.

181
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,978
No one had been below decks for weeks.

182
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,847
Were all the slaves dead?

183
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,080
Most were.

184
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,720
Some were still alive - barely

185
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:48,015
still manacled to the corpses
of their companions.

186
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:52,356
They had kept themselves alive
by resorting to cannibalism.

187
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,194
But the story doesn't end there.

188
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,828
The men who climbed aboard the Mariposa
had now been exposed to the disease.

189
00:13:57,868 --> 00:14:00,663
It spread through the town like wildfire.

190
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:05,003
By the end of the winter, between
smallpox and other diseases,

191
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,376
over fifty of the town-folk were dead,

192
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,747
their bodies literally piled
in the unheated meeting house,

193
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,150
the ground was too frozen to bury them.

194
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,120
The building was kept locked, of course.

195
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,215
Some of our founding fathers were
among the dead,

196
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,852
August Pierce, Josiah Corwin
and Nathan Sawyer.

197
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:28,333
In Spring, the North end
of the cemetery was dug up

198
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,063
and all of the bodies were interred

199
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:33,164
in a single mass grave
with one stone marker.

200
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,873
I've been through that cemetery
a thousand times.

201
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,844
Everyone knows there's
supposed to be a mass grave,

202
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,204
but it's not there.

203
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,409
Within a few years, the bodies
had rotted away underground,

204
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,440
as could be expected.

205
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:49,319
The grave dropped by several
feet and was covered over again.

206
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:54,316
The stone is still there, Mr. Sherman,
but covered by several feet of earth.

207
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,919
Nobody ever put up a hew one.

208
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,753
- Mr. Allen?
- Yes, Miss Russell?

209
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:01,825
What happened to the slaves?
The ones who were still alive?

210
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,963
In a vain attempt to prevent the disease
from coming ashore,

211
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:09,601
the cargo hold was locked,
and the ship was taken out to sea.

212
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,475
There, it was set aflame.

213
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,505
With them still alive?

214
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,618
With them still alive.

215
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,880
So, how are you with ghosts?

216
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,823
What do you mean, "how am I?"

217
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:30,420
You know. Can you talk to them,
or see them, or anything?

218
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,897
I tried. I didn't have much luck.

219
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,231
You're thinking of going to that
cemetery, aren't you.

220
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,269
Sure. Why not?

221
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,715
For one thing, half the kids in class
are probably up there

222
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,132
looking for sunken gravestones.

223
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,573
We don't have to go right now.

224
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,599
We can go tonight, after dark.

225
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,510
I dunno. I'm pretty beat.

226
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,357
I had this really wacked
nightmare last night.

227
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,381
Ah, it's the weekend.

228
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:50,692
You can sleep tomorrow morning.

229
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,208
Mr. Allen didn't say anything about
there being ghosts there.

230
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,452
Come on! It's the greatest disaster
in Dunkirk's history!

231
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,300
There's got to be a
couple of ghosts in there.

232
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,122
You've lived here your whole life?

233
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,159
More or less.

234
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,686
Has anyone seen a ghost
in that cemetery?

235
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:07,829
I don't know. But look, we won't
just wander in and hope one appears.

236
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:12,828
We'll do a spell or something, to try to
contact one.

237
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:16,406
Well, I still have a Ouija board...

238
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,911
Perfect! We'll use that.

239
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,571
The cemetery's just up the
road from here.

240
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,447
You're practically living
right next to it.

241
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:28,282
Midnight tonight, go up this hill, about
a quarter of a mile.

242
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,755
I'll be waiting at the gate.

243
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,053
To jump out and scare the shit out of me.

244
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,321
Come on! Don't be a wimp.

245
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,829
This will be great!

246
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,264
Jonathan? How was school?

247
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,139
Fine.

248
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,009
I'm planning dinner for five o'clock.

249
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,410
Okay.

250
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,746
Spirits of those who lie buried
beneath us, can you hear us?

251
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,293
Is there anybody who wishes
to speak to us?

252
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:19,093
They're old. Maybe they're
hard of hearing.

253
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,624
Shh! We're trying to reach those
who died of smallpox in the year 1784.

254
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:27,367
Is there anyone who would like
to talk to us?

255
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,203
"Yes!"

256
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,538
You pushed it there!

257
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,135
No, I didn't! I swear.

258
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,703
You're jerking me around.

259
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,976
I'm not! Ask it something else.

260
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:39,974
Are one of those
who died of smallpox?

261
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,420
"No!"

262
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,924
How did you die?

263
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,118
What's your name?

264
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,623
I...

265
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,498
<i>know</i>

266
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,697
<i>you</i>

267
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:02,641
"I know you?"
What's that supposed to mean?

268
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:03,775
Quiet! Someone's coming!

269
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:22,794
(Gangling keys)

270
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,450
Salve, magne domine Lucifer,
te salutamus!

271
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,121
Nos adiuvare atque nostros
Investigationem succurrere

272
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,430
et finem subvenire te rogamus.

273
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,379
(snores)

274
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:34,493
(crunch of wood)

275
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,691
Careful! I don't want it damaged!

276
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,176
Beautiful...

277
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:59,441
Salve, antiquissime, te salutamus!

278
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,194
Fill it back in.

279
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:59,007
Christ! They took so long, I thought I
was going to fucking wet myself!

280
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,306
I am so fucking cold.

281
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,839
Have you heard of Tobias Corwin?

282
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,972
No. But Corwin's a big name around town.

283
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,675
The family's been here forever.

284
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,184
What about these symbols?

285
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,649
Isn't that the Masons?

286
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:43,917
No. I mean, yes, those are,
but not this one.

287
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:47,751
I've never seen anything
like that before.

288
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,559
I couldn't catch much of what
that guy was saying.

289
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,835
I'm not that good with Latin, anyway.

290
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,547
But I'm sure I heard him say
something about Lucifer at some point.

291
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,869
<i>"Lucifer? You mean 'Satan?"</i>

292
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,397
More or less.

293
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,534
You're kidding me!

294
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:05,668
No.

295
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,737
'Satan?' As in a Satanic cult?
In Dunkirk?

296
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,010
Maybe.

297
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,744
I don't even believe in Satan.

298
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,013
Neither do I, really.

299
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:16,052
The medieval Christian church 
took a minor demon from the Old Testament

300
00:24:16,076 --> 00:24:18,076
and fabricated an arch-nemesis out of him.

301
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:19,821
But I know how magic works.

302
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:23,055
Satan has been the focus of black magic
for almost two thousand years.

303
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:24,324
That makes him powerful.

304
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:25,990
Are you saying he's real?

305
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:29,934
As a focus, at least.
As something that can be tapped into.

306
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:30,969
So what?

307
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:34,962
Do you really care if some whackos are
running around at night digging up old graves?

308
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,534
Not really.

309
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,871
But I do wonder what they're up to.

310
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:41,471
Probably trying to bring about
the earthly manifestation of Satan

311
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:42,981
in the body of a young child,

312
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:46,952
so he can hasten Armageddon
and unleash all the minions of Hell.

313
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,717
It's what Satanic cults do.

314
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,580
I need to get a look
at old town records.

315
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:52,582
Why?

316
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:56,725
There's got to be some reason why
they chose to dig up Tobias Corwin.

317
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:59,322
The town library has a records room,

318
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:04,394
But you have to get special permission
to get in there.

319
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:26,220
Where the hell have you been?

320
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,785
Just down the road.

321
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:36,198
I thought you got rid of that thing.

322
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:40,194
No. I put it away for a while.

323
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:44,370
Were you trying to contact
your father again, Jonathan?

324
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,879
No, Mom. I wasn't.

325
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,182
Well, what were you doing, then?

326
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:54,345
Mr. Allen was talking yesterday
in American History class

327
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:58,721
about these early settlers
that died in an epidemic.

328
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:02,992
They're buried in an unmarked
mass grave, in a cemetery down the road.

329
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,829
So, you thought you'd try
to contact them.

330
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:06,797
Yeah.

331
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,991
And did you?

332
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,261
Was David with you?

333
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,272
Yes.

334
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,206
Was this your idea or his?

335
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,609
He didn't make me do it.
It was both our idea.

336
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,579
Its a good thing it's not
a school night.

337
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:25,811
Why don't you go on up to bed.
I have to get ready for work.

338
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,717
Can I go with you?

339
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:28,948
What for?

340
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,354
I want to look up some stuff
in the town records.

341
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,825
David says there's a room
at the library.

342
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,920
I don't how Mrs. Henniker
would feel about that.

343
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,430
And aren't you tired?

344
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,694
I'm fine. I can sleep later.

345
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:44,532
Can't you at least ask
Mrs. Henniker? Please?

346
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:45,765
Al right.

347
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:49,399
Why don't you go upstairs and take
a shower and put on some clean clothes,

348
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,102
while I finish my coffee.

349
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:57,378
I can't have you meeting my boss
looking like you slept in a gutter.

350
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,226
I thought I'd find you here.

351
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,463
I went by your house
but you weren't there.

352
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:19,801
So I thought you might have
come back this way.

353
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,306
I was at the library
most of the day,

354
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,536
Looking up information
on Tobias Corwin.

355
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,474
And?

356
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,105
Not much. He was pretty boring.
He was a trader.

357
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,147
A traitor?

358
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:33,408
A trader. You know, someone who deals
with imports and exports.

359
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:34,920
Mostly sugar and coffee.

360
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:39,356
Slaves weren't a popular commodity
in that time, in the 1800s.

361
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:44,124
He was born in 1743
and died from influenza in 1849.

362
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:47,155
He was a hundred and six years old?

363
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:51,261
His father, Jefferson, lived to be
almost a hundred and twenty.

364
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,772
Maybe they were vampires.

365
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,106
Maybe. I can't find any other reason
why anyone would want to dig them up.

366
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,908
They only dug up one.

367
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,784
Holy shit!

368
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:18,558
Jefferson Corwin. Died 1819.
Dug up like the other one.

369
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,195
We should check to see if
there are any more like this.

370
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,827
I already have. There's one more.

371
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,497
Another Corwin. Tobias's son, Zachariah.

372
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,997
He died in 1882,
at a hundred and twelve years old.

373
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:33,535
Three Corwins. All men.
All very long-lived.

374
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:36,241
And all with this weird
symbol on their headstones.

375
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,113
Maybe it's a family crest.

376
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,780
Not all the Corwins have it.
Not even all the men.

377
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,549
Only the ones who were dug up,

378
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,489
And two more that have yet
to be disturbed.

379
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:47,492
So you think they're coming back
for those two?

380
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:50,757
Probably, starting
with Zachariah's son, Samuel.

381
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,390
Are we doing another
midnight stakeout, then?

382
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:57,130
I haven't slept in twenty-four hours.
I'm not up for another all-nighter.

383
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:00,764
Come on! You know they're gonna be back
for this Samuel guy.

384
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:03,036
Just go to bed now,
then you can get up later.

385
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:06,807
I can't. My mom wants me to meet her
downtown when she gets off work.

386
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,314
She's taking me shopping.

387
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:16,747
This might look good on you.
What do you think?

388
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,256
It's kind of bright.

389
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,451
It's not black, you mean.

390
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:23,121
You know, it wouldn't kill you to try
something different for a change.

391
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:24,959
I like black.

392
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:28,092
You can at least try it on.

393
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,602
There's a dressing room.

394
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:41,413
So did you find what you were looking
for in the Corwin Room this morning?

395
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,540
The Corwin Room?

396
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:47,142
The room you were doing your research
in. Didn't you see the plaque?

397
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,017
No I didn't notice it.

398
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:51,614
Is it named after Josiah Corwin?

399
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,147
Who's that?

400
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,319
He's one of the founding fathers
of this town

401
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,954
I guess you have been learning something.

402
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:03,025
It's named after some old man in town
who donated money to the library.

403
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,263
What's his name?

404
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,634
Corwin.

405
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,303
His first name, Mom.

406
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,810
Um, Eli, I think.

407
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,375
Is he still alive?

408
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:20,511
Oh, yeah. Mrs. Henniker says he runs
an antique store downtown.

409
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,419
Where?

410
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:28,517
Oh, God. That shirt
looks terrible on you.

411
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:45,672
Good Afternoon!

412
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:46,906
Good Afternoon.

413
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,414
Is there anything I can help you with?

414
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,473
Oh, I'm afraid we're just looking.

415
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:56,852
No harm in that. You Look all you want.
My name's Eli, if you have any questions.

416
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,083
Thank you.

417
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:01,149
I'm Laura Kelly.
This is my son, Jonathan.

418
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,388
Kelly?

419
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,829
Oh, yes! I've heard about you!
You're the new assistant librarian.

420
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,888
That's me!

421
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:08,491
Pleased to meet you.

422
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:13,767
I hear you're renting Ned Donelly's
place, down on Rabbit Hollow Road.

423
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,604
Would you be interested in something
to fix the place up?

424
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:20,441
I've got a very good end table
that just came in.

425
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:23,141
Clara Bowdin's mother
passed away last year,

426
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:27,118
and Clara's just got around
to selling off some of the furniture.

427
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,620
Oh, no, thank you.

428
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,384
We're on a bit of
a tight budget for a while.

429
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:34,552
Just till things settle down
from the move.

430
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:37,563
If you're interested
in old books, young man,

431
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,758
I've got a whole bunch of them
in the shelves upstairs.

432
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,794
Feel free to poke around, if you like.

433
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:42,795
Thanks.

434
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:46,634
Some of them are rather delicate,
but I'm sure you'll be very careful.

435
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,400
I will.

436
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:52,501
Now, young lady, you come with me
and take a look.

437
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:53,978
Don't worry about the cost.

438
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:57,243
Eli Corwin isn't one to put
anyone in the poorhouse.

439
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,683
Now, it needs
a little bit of touching up.

440
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:05,521
But I could have it ready for you
in just a few days.

441
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:13,718
I thought you'd find
these things interesting.

442
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,954
Personally, they give me the creeps.

443
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,325
Then why do you have them?

444
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,194
Oh, they sell well enough.

445
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:22,997
That Davis you're looking at goes
for over four hundred dollars.

446
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,435
There are people in this town
who collect occult books?

447
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,461
In this town?

448
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,806
I suppose some of the younger kids
might be interested,

449
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,904
But, no offense, they couldn't afford
the more expensive ones.

450
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:38,780
No, believe it or not I
actually own a computer.

451
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:41,809
I do a pretty good business online, too.

452
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,050
There's handful of collectors
around the world who think

453
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:50,153
these nasty things are
worth paying a lot of money for.

454
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:53,559
To each his own, I guess.

455
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,203
I can't believe how
sweet that old man was!

456
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,800
Do you know how little he asked
for that end table?

457
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:08,177
It's probably cursed
and kills anyone who owns it.

458
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,181
No! That table is not evil.

459
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:14,118
I'm sure he's just being nice
because we're new in town.

460
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:18,111
So, did you satisfy
your curiosity about Eli?

461
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:25,687
I guess I just wanted to see what
a Corwin who was still breathing looked like.

462
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:34,765
Hey! You up?

463
00:34:57,696 --> 00:35:00,131
What time is it?

464
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,495
It's about ten.

465
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:02,932
In the morning?

466
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,697
Of course, "in the morning."

467
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:09,003
I went to bed about six last night.
I felt like I'd sleep for days.

468
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,874
Sorry. Your mom betrayed you
and let me in when I knocked.

469
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,606
The bitch.

470
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,738
I stopped by the cemetery
on the way over.

471
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,750
Samuel's grave has been dug up.

472
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,878
I thought it might be.

473
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,753
That means Christoph's is next.

474
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,354
So, what do we do now?

475
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:30,555
Back to the library. I want to find out
more about that family.

476
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:34,623
Fuckin' research!
Just what I wanted to do on my weekend.

477
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:37,135
Is that a tattoo?

478
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,100
I'm sorry.

479
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:50,808
Get your ass out of bed.
I just can't wait to go hit those books!

480
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:04,589
It looks as if Eli is the
only living Corwin in town.

481
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:09,590
So we should strike now,
while we have him at a disadvantage!

482
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:12,126
He had a daughter, Elspeth.

483
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,504
But she died in Louisiana,
almost twelve years ago.

484
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,373
I think he mentioned that once.

485
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,778
Eli's the guy who loaned you
those grimoires, isn't he?

486
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:22,678
Yeah.

487
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:24,944
Why didn't you tell me before?

488
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:26,678
Why? Why does it matter?

489
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,584
He's a Corwin, isn't he?

490
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,248
He's a nice old man
who sells used furniture.

491
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,314
You've watched
more horror films than I have.

492
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,486
Antiques dealers are always evil.

493
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:40,624
Just like clowns and friendly neighbors
who bring you health drinks.

494
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,297
He is only 73, though.

495
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,885
It's too early to tell if he'll live

496
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:54,004
to be as old as the ones
with that symbol on their headstones.

497
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,878
I'm telling you, they were vampires.

498
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:59,850
The townspeople put magic symbols
on their headstones,

499
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,184
so that they wouldn't crawl
out of their graves.

500
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,280
Hi, Mrs. Henniker.

501
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:25,238
I think they forgot a headstone.

502
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:29,304
If the town of Dunkirk was living in
constant fear of undead Corwins,

503
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,076
nobody thought it worth writing about.

504
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:32,777
Everyone seemed to like them.

505
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,615
They named streets and
buildings after them.

506
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,953
I can't find a single bad thing
anybody had to say about them.

507
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,857
Take a look at this.

508
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,619
'Tales of Ghosts and Witchcraft
in Old New England'?

509
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:49,258
It's better than the shit you're reading.

510
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:54,132
"In the year 1784, a young woman
by the name of Mary Legget,"

511
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:57,267
"who had been working as a maidservant
in the Corwin household,"

512
00:37:57,308 --> 00:38:00,107
"began spreading a rumor
around town that Josiah Corwin"

513
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:01,476
"had repeatedly raped her,"

514
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:03,538
"and had performed
acts of witchcraft upon her."

515
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,050
"She had recently been dismissed from
the Corwin household,"

516
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:09,315
"purportedly for theft,
so few believed her story."

517
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:11,755
"A few months later,
she took her own life."

518
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,725
"It was rumored that she had
given birth to a child, in secret."

519
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:19,128
"But no trace of a baby was ever found."

520
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:23,295
That was the same year Josiah Corwin
died of smallpox.

521
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,063
What if she was telling the truth?

522
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:32,066
What if he really did rape her,
and do some kind of magic spell on her?

523
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:37,103
Who knows? We're just speculating,
at this point.

524
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,810
Here's something else to speculate about:

525
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,751
What if she didn't really kill herself?

526
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:44,312
You think Josiah killed her
just to shut her up?

527
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,084
It's possible.

528
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,755
If she died just before
the smallpox epidemic,

529
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:51,956
there might not have been time
to bury her before Winter set in.

530
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,557
By Spring, there would have been
too many other bodies to deal with.

531
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:01,004
She may have been thrown
in the mass grave with the rest.

532
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:05,366
Died during the epidemic,
but not from smallpox.

533
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,001
Speak to us, spirit!

534
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:11,744
We are trying to reach the spirit
who contacted us two nights ago.

535
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:16,516
Are you there? Are you
the spirit of Mary Legget?

536
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:20,991
Jonathan, it's been almost an hour.
I don't think it's going to work tonight.

537
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,494
Just a little longer.

538
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:28,556
Mary Legget! Can you hear us? Mary

539
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,628
Jonathan! What's happening?

540
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:35,997
I'm all right. I just...
I saw something.

541
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,512
There's definitely a bunch
of bodies buried underneath us.

542
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,018
And they're not happy.

543
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,620
Did you see Mary? Or Josiah?

544
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:54,319
There were too many of them.
I couldn't tell one from the other.

545
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,828
Well, we should probably
stop now, anyway.

546
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,023
It's dark, and we don't know

547
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:04,126
when our friendly neighborhood
Satanic cult is going to stop by.

548
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,404
Are you okay?

549
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:14,775
Yeah.

550
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:18,907
I've never had anything
like that happen before.

551
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:27,317
After my father died, I tried
to contact him, every night.

552
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,889
I was obsessed with it.

553
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,794
Nothing ever happened.

554
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,924
Except that my mother took me
to a therapist,

555
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:39,164
He told her to take away my Ouija board.

556
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:42,798
How come you still have it, then?

557
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,435
She knew if she took it away,
I'd just get another one.

558
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,775
So we talked about it instead.

559
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:53,273
She asked me to stop using it,
and I promised I would.

560
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:54,547
Did you stop?

561
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,644
Yes. Until now.

562
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,022
Salve, antiquissime, te salutamus!

563
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:02,472
<i>That's Mrs. Henniker! My mom's boss!</i>

564
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:07,212
<i>Wow! She's smiling, and her face isn't
even falling off.</i>

565
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:09,616
Come on!

566
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,399
Prudence Whitehead?

567
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:29,802
That's Mr. Allen!

568
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:33,175
I should have known he'd be part
of an evil cult.

569
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:37,444
Coach Warren, too And - Fuckl!
Police Chief Lewis!

570
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:40,144
That woman over there
is Dr. Marshfield.

571
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:42,812
Why is she wearing that red stole?

572
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:46,188
I don't know. But a few of them are.

573
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:49,057
Do you know their names?

574
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,090
Jake Dunlap.

575
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:54,261
Tom Westcott.

576
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:55,799
Bradley Somerset.

577
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,301
And John Lowry?

578
00:43:57,335 --> 00:43:59,429
I don't see him.

579
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,737
Wait. Over in the far corner,
there he is.

580
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:06,472
How did you know he would be here?

581
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:09,879
Wait! There's the guy
with Cristoph's head.

582
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:13,509
Come! Let us welcome our esteemed guest.

583
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:17,719
Eli Corwin. He's their leader.

584
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:22,290
You still haven't told me how you knew
John Lowry would be there.

585
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,794
Because he's one of the six.

586
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:24,828
Six what?

587
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,289
Don't you know anything
about local politics?

588
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,800
I know they're boring.

589
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:34,237
Look. John Lowry, Dr. Marshfield,
Mrs. Henniker, Jake Dunlap,

590
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:38,874
Bradley Somerset and Tom Westcott
are your town Selectmen.

591
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,773
So then this cult is running the town?

592
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:42,904
There's something else.

593
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:47,783
In the town records for 1784, those same
six names are listed as Selectmen.

594
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:53,313
Over two hundred years,
and all six names are still the same!

595
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:56,992
What are you saying?
That they really are vampires?

596
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,189
Vampires?

597
00:44:58,229 --> 00:44:59,924
The immortal undead.

598
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:04,868
No! Will you get off this vampire thing?
What I'm saying is...

599
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:07,803
Do you remember the last time
there was a local election here?

600
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,306
You mean, for Mayor?

601
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,398
For anything!

602
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,000
Not really.

603
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,171
I'm not sure there ever has been.

604
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:18,445
What if every position of power
in this town has been passed down

605
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:22,817
from one generation to the next,
keeping the same families in control?

606
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,686
With the Corwins running everything.

607
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,956
I need to get another look
at those town records...

608
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:31,689
Oh, yay.

609
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,527
Who does that house belong to?

610
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,895
It's the old Corwin house.

611
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:38,391
Eli owns it now, but nobody's
lived in it since World War II.

612
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,564
Christoph died when Eli was just a kid,

613
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:44,835
And his mother didn't like living out
there by herself, so they moved into town.

614
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:47,845
Did Christoph die in the war?

615
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:49,539
I don't think so.

616
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,982
I remember hearing somewhere
that he committed suicide.

617
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:56,282
Anyway, I read something in the paper
a few years ago,

618
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,051
about the historical society
wanting to restore it,

619
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,785
but Eli wouldn't let them near it.

620
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:01,825
No shit!

621
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:05,426
I'll bet anything he's got
a temple or something set up there.

622
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:06,555
Let me guess.

623
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,532
You want to go back during the day
and poke around.

624
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:10,977
Do you think it would be dangerous?

625
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,001
I don't know.

626
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:14,848
They don't really have much reason
to stake a guard around the place.

627
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:17,041
As far as they're concerned,
nobody knows about them.

628
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:22,403
Christoph was the last Corwin left in the
cemetery who had the seal on his headstone.

629
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,278
That means they're nearly ready to do

630
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:25,908
whatever it is they're planning.

631
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,247
If he was the last,

632
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,915
How do we know they aren't doing this
ritual, or whatever it is right now?

633
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:33,515
He was the last with the seal
on his headstone,

634
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,891
But he isn't the last Corwin
high priest in the cemetery.

635
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:38,292
Josiah?

636
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:41,025
He was the first Corwin to live here,

637
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:44,763
And if Mary Legget wasn't crazy,
he was practicing magic.

638
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:48,170
If anyone established
the cult here, it was him.

639
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,299
But they can't have any idea where he is.

640
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:54,608
I mean, that grave must be maybe
ten feet deep and twice that across.

641
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,239
There are over fifty bodies in it!

642
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:58,476
That'll slow them down.

643
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,416
But if they really know
how to use magic,

644
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:03,785
they should be able
to divine where he is.

645
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,017
Then I guess we don't have any choice.

646
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:08,502
If we want to find out
what they're doing before they do it,

647
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:12,121
we'll have to break into that house.

648
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,749
Mr. Kelly!

649
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:39,083
Am I boring you, Mr. Kelly?

650
00:47:39,123 --> 00:47:43,185
Or perhaps you'd like
to see the school nurse?

651
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,922
He's fine.

652
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:51,126
Please try to pay attention, Mr. Kelly.

653
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,100
How do you do that thing with Mr. Allen?

654
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,140
What thing?

655
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,475
Intimidate him like that.

656
00:47:58,509 --> 00:47:59,899
Allen's a prissy little snot.

657
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:01,921
He probably got picked on
when he was in school,

658
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,604
So how he's taking it out
on his students.

659
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,206
Just stand up to him.

660
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:08,446
I can make him back down, because
he knows I'm not afraid to kick his ass.

661
00:48:08,486 --> 00:48:11,114
I never pictured you as someone who goes
around kicking ass.

662
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:13,419
I used to do a lot of it
when I was younger.

663
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:15,516
These days, I don't get
into fights very often,

664
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:21,760
<i>But of course I've got a rep now
So people avoid pissing me off.</i>

665
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,260
Where are we?

666
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:29,238
We're almost there.

667
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,503
We didn't pass this last night.

668
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:33,510
I took us down a different path.

669
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:36,172
This is the south side of the property.

670
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,682
Something doesn't feel right.

671
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:42,447
What? It's just an old barn.

672
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:44,385
Want to go check it out?

673
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:45,787
No!

674
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,690
David!

675
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:07,242
I think you were right.

676
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,485
We should have kept on walking.

677
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,663
What the fuck is that?

678
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:32,658
Someone has been doing a ritual out here.

679
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:37,836
Why would they do that?

680
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:42,972
Killing things, sacrificing them,
can lend more power to the ritual.

681
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,238
Do you do that?

682
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:47,614
No!

683
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:57,019
Let's get the fuck out of here.

684
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,635
What if somebody's in there?

685
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,640
We kick their asses.

686
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,540
Did you bring a weapon?

687
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:15,443
I'm not afraid of a bunch of old people.

688
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:18,881
Those two guys in the cemetery
didn't exactly look infirm.

689
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,441
They could be Renfields.

690
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,617
Renfields? People who eat bugs?

691
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:25,353
Henchmen.

692
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:29,555
Come on. Don't be a wuss.

693
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:51,073
I thought we might run into
one or two of these.

694
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:53,914
Wait! They'll know someone was here.

695
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:58,684
They'll know someone was here.
But they won't know who.

696
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,458
This is where they gathered last night.

697
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:08,329
Has Eli sold off all the furniture?

698
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:10,834
I don't know. Maybe.

699
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:12,992
You wanna check upstairs?

700
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:16,996
They didn't go upstairs.
They went back towards where we came in.

701
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:18,341
You're the one who keeps saying.

702
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,603
Evil Satanic zombies are going to jump out
and kill us at any moment.

703
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,272
The least we can do is check upstairs,

704
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:27,012
Make sure nobody's here first
before we do anything else.

705
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:28,780
You first.

706
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:34,915
Fine. It's always the guy in the rear
who gets it, anyway.

707
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,055
I don't know, Jonathan...

708
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,530
It has to be in here.

709
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:44,125
We've looked everywhere else,
and we know they didn't go outside.

710
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:47,604
There's no way all those people
could fit in this tiny space.

711
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:51,597
Maybe they stayed out in the mud room.

712
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:58,674
Please tell me you're not looking
for a secret door.

713
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:01,117
Give me the flashlight.

714
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:12,923
These boards slide back into the wall.

715
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:18,663
You want me to go first?

716
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:33,516
Well, isn't this medieval.

717
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:36,284
Not medieval.
Not even eighteenth century.

718
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,915
This wasn't built in Josiah Corwin's day.

719
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,624
How do you know?

720
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,322
I don't think they used cement
in the seventeen-hundreds.

721
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:49,094
Looks to me like somebody rebuilt this
in the last fifty years or so.

722
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:50,726
They probably had to redo the walls

723
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:55,467
the last time a demon got loose
and drenched them in human blood.

724
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,201
After you.

725
00:53:21,465 --> 00:53:24,332
I think we found it.

726
00:53:38,282 --> 00:53:41,912
I was right.
There's still one missing.

727
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:17,176
These pages are vellum.

728
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:18,221
Vellum?

729
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:22,214
Cured lambskin.
At least, I hope it's lambskin.

730
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:30,091
This stuff is really twisted,
even for me.

731
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:31,795
What do you mean?

732
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:35,794
It's all blood sacrifice.
Dogs, cats, goats, chickens...

733
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:42,974
It's not here.

734
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:44,503
What's not there?

735
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:47,984
The ritual. There's nothing in here
that involves collecting heads.

736
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:50,487
No, there wouldn't be.

737
00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:54,847
What are you doing?

738
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:58,851
You've gone as far as you can, on your
own. It's time I told you the truth.

739
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:00,557
What truth?

740
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,329
What happened to you?

741
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:07,838
They happened to me.

742
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:11,270
You already knew about Eli
and his coven.

743
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,140
Jonathan.

744
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:13,807
You knew exactly where this chamber was.

745
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:15,009
I needed you to see this

746
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:16,256
I don't want to see anything!

747
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,611
Jonathan!

748
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,569
Oh, shit.

749
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,903
This isn't happening.

750
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:13,930
Anubis, guide of the Underworld,
show me the path to safety.

751
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:16,872
Anubis, guide of the Underworld,
show me the path to safety.

752
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:22,004
Anubis, guide of the Underworld,
show me the path to safety.

753
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,808
Ani! Ani, come!

754
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,713
Hey, are you okay?

755
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,320
I'm fine.

756
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:50,704
Hello?

757
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,202
Oh, hi, David!

758
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:57,269
No, I'm sorry.
He actually went to bed early tonight.

759
00:56:57,314 --> 00:57:00,079
He wasn't feeling very well.

760
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:02,711
Sure, I'll tell him.

761
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:05,984
You too. Have a good night.

762
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,959
<i>(tap on window)</i>

763
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:29,608
What the fuck do you want?

764
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:31,273
I want to talk to you.

765
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:33,826
Get the fuck away from here!
You're going to wake up my mother.

766
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,411
I'm not leaving till you come down.

767
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,362
Over here.

768
00:57:59,376 --> 00:58:00,810
All right. What do you want?

769
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:02,642
I want you to understand.

770
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:03,679
I understand.

771
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:06,648
You're part of the coven, and you
were grooming me for the next sacrifice.

772
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,715
No! I'm not part of the coven.

773
00:58:08,752 --> 00:58:11,244
I would never do anything
to hurt you, Jonathan.

774
00:58:11,288 --> 00:58:14,485
It's just... I needed your help.

775
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,393
So you lied to me,

776
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:20,556
And put me through a lot of trouble
to dig up information you already knew.

777
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:24,864
If I had told you flat out that
this nice, sweet, old antique shop owner

778
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:26,596
was the leader of a Satanic coven,

779
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:30,129
that they were doing this to me,

780
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,938
You would have thought I was crazy.

781
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,671
Admit it.

782
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:37,379
You would've thought
I was cutting myself up.

783
00:58:37,414 --> 00:58:41,942
And just making up all these
paranoid fantasies to justify it.

784
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:44,613
It's time you told me
exactly what's going on.

785
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,588
My mother was Eli's daughter.

786
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:50,423
Maybe she could have even taken his place
as grandmaster of the coven one day

787
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,486
I think he was preparing her for it.

788
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,726
But he's a sick fuck.

789
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:59,862
Some of her 'training' involved
being tied down during the rituals,

790
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,531
So he could rape her.

791
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,631
He's you're father.

792
00:59:05,442 --> 00:59:08,503
She ran away, down to Louisiana.

793
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,014
Maybe she thought
she could hide from him.

794
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:15,144
After I was born,
she legally changed our name to Ross.

795
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:20,282
We lived there maybe about five years,
before he killed her.

796
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:21,822
How?

797
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,128
A car accident.

798
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:28,257
But you don't think it was an accident.

799
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,289
She left me standing there,

800
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:35,328
In a supermarket parking lot
next to a cart of groceries.

801
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:37,568
Then she got in the car,

802
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:41,066
And then she drove off across
three lanes of traffic...

803
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:44,046
And head first into a semi.

804
00:59:44,381 --> 00:59:47,142
He can make you see things, Jonathan.

805
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:49,516
Things that aren't really there.

806
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:52,386
How'd you get back then?

807
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:56,416
He showed up the day of the funeral.

808
00:59:56,493 --> 01:00:00,225
I don't know how; I mean, my name
was different from his, and everything.

809
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,857
But somehow he got custody of me.

810
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:06,494
He brought me back here and then...

811
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:10,233
What did he do to you, David?

812
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:15,602
The same things he did to my mother.

813
01:00:16,146 --> 01:00:17,910
And worse.

814
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:21,246
Why would he cut you like that?

815
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,752
You said it yourself,

816
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:25,016
Killing things can give you power.

817
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:27,888
Well, so can torturing them.

818
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:30,990
And you've been keeping
your scars hidden.

819
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:32,995
That's why you don't go to gym.

820
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,508
So you won't have to take
your clothes off in front of anyone.

821
01:00:35,532 --> 01:00:37,630
That was arranged by Dr. Marshfield.

822
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:40,932
You think Eli will kill you,
if you try to leave?

823
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:43,440
I know he will.

824
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:46,975
There's something I haven't
told you about yet.

825
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,010
What?

826
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:50,445
I knew you wouldn't find the ritual
you were looking for

827
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,847
in the coven's Book of Shadows.

828
01:00:52,883 --> 01:00:56,376
There's a special book, passed down
through the generations.

829
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:59,719
Only a grandmaster is ever allowed
to read from it.

830
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,781
But you have.

831
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:05,155
I suspected weeks ago
that he was planning something.

832
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:06,195
Something big.

833
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:11,160
So I broke into his study.
I found the ritual and copied it.

834
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:13,067
He intends to kill you.

835
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:16,471
The first human sacrifice in Dunkirk
in over a century.

836
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,050
There's something that doesn't add up.

837
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,844
This isn't some ancient ritual,
passed down through generations.

838
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:23,847
None of the past grandmasters went
around digging up their predecessors,

839
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,679
Or else they wouldn't be there
for Eli to dig up now.

840
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:31,051
He wrote it himself. He's trying
to tap into their power; absorb it.

841
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:32,282
And extend his life.

842
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:34,416
By taking mine.

843
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:37,256
What are you going to do?

844
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:41,754
You saw for yourself. He's only got
five heads. He needs six.

845
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:43,630
Why? He made it up.

846
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:46,830
There's no reason he can't rewrite it
for five heads if he wants to.

847
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,838
You know how magic works, Jonathan.

848
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:51,671
In order for this ritual to work,
everything has to line up perfectly.

849
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,006
All the symbols have to click into place.

850
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:58,504
If he changes the symbolism around
everything will start to unravel.

851
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,744
Everything is centered
around this symbol.

852
01:02:00,784 --> 01:02:02,582
The Corwin family seal.

853
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:04,451
It has seven points.

854
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:07,684
There has to be a head
at each of these points.

855
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,954
Then Eli has to stand here.

856
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:12,223
It won't work with only five heads.

857
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:14,321
So you need to stop him
from digging up Josiah.

858
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:16,093
He's already being stopped.

859
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:19,102
Even if he digs up the entire mass grave,

860
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,467
he won't be able to tell
which body is Josiah's.

861
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:22,504
Do you know why?

862
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:23,839
Mary Legget.

863
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:27,969
She's blocking all the Corwins
from finding that body. Even me.

864
01:02:28,011 --> 01:02:30,241
Because Josiah murdered her.

865
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,477
No. Because he sacrificed her child.

866
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:41,013
Then why doesn't Eli get one of the
other coven members to find the body?

867
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:45,392
They're just parasites.
They don't have any real power.

868
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:05,071
But you do, Jonathan.

869
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:13,522
So you decided to recruit me?
80 I could help you find Josiah?

870
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:17,285
It doesn't mean I don't like you
for other reasons.

871
01:03:17,327 --> 01:03:19,022
But the only way to stop the ritual

872
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:23,397
is to find that head
first, and destroy it.

873
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:30,000
Why can't we just leave it where it is,
where Eli can't get to it?

874
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,338
How long do you think
Mary can hold him off?

875
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:35,868
She had some natural magic ability,
but no real training.

876
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:38,904
Her hatred of the Corwins
has made her strong,

877
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:41,007
But he'll find a way to get past her.

878
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:44,282
It's just a matter of time.

879
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:46,950
I need you, Jonathan.

880
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,652
I have to get Josiah's body
before Eli does,

881
01:03:49,693 --> 01:03:52,287
And you're the only one who can find it.

882
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:55,560
I already know where it is.

883
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,527
It was by a little pine tree...

884
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,999
There! That's it.

885
01:04:05,642 --> 01:04:07,770
Are you sure?

886
01:04:08,078 --> 01:04:09,443
Positive.

887
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:12,548
Wait!

888
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:15,341
Maybe it's not such a good idea for you
to help me with the digging.

889
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:17,754
What, afraid Mary might strike me dead?

890
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:24,750
She's kept me from finding the body,
but she won't keep me from digging it up.

891
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:36,837
Will your mom freak
if she doesn't find you in your bed?

892
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,705
She leaves for work before I get up.

893
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:43,111
I'm hoping she's not going
to notice I'm gone.

894
01:04:44,481 --> 01:04:48,577
I wonder if we'll run into
that missing grave marker.

895
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:49,949
No.

896
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:54,922
I think it's somewhere over in that area.

897
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,058
What?

898
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,652
You're so weird.

899
01:04:57,827 --> 01:05:02,162
I'm not the one whose family
does human sacrifice.

900
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:08,701
All right. Break time's over.

901
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,935
The prospect of letting Eli kill you
is starting to look more appealing.

902
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:13,067
Fuck you.

903
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:15,942
I don't have the energy.

904
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:20,008
Get off your ass and help me!

905
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,048
Jonathan! Come here!

906
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,061
That's not him.

907
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:39,797
We have to get past
a few other bodies first.

908
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:55,479
So you're the great Josiah Corwin.

909
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:01,284
I always thought you'd be taller.

910
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:05,685
What are you going to do with it?

911
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:18,602
Should we fill it back in?

912
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,406
I don't have the strength.
We can finish it tomorrow.

913
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:24,470
Don't you think we should
at least cover up the bodies?

914
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:27,145
Okay. But just enough
to cover them for now.

915
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,962
And then I can figure out how the hell
I'm going to explain to my Mom

916
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:33,281
where the fuck I've been all day.

917
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,502
Can I ride in with you tomorrow?

918
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:55,773
To the library? What about school?

919
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:57,109
I can walk to school from there.

920
01:06:57,146 --> 01:07:00,673
I just need to check a few things
in the Corwin room first.

921
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:02,981
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

922
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,681
Mrs. Henniker doesn't want you
in there for a little while.

923
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:07,247
Why not?

924
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:09,759
It's not you, particularly.

925
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:12,184
She doesn't trust David.

926
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:16,688
I guess he has a reputation
around town for getting into trouble.

927
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:18,633
That old bitch!

928
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:21,865
Hey! Did I raise you to talk like that?

929
01:07:21,905 --> 01:07:25,170
I know Mrs. Henniker
isn't exactly warm and fuzzy,

930
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:28,075
But she's been going through
a real rough time lately.

931
01:07:28,111 --> 01:07:31,274
The four-year-old who disappeared?
Did you hear about that?

932
01:07:31,314 --> 01:07:32,145
Yeah.

933
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:34,240
Well, he was her grandson.

934
01:07:34,284 --> 01:07:38,585
He was just playing
in his mother's back yard and vanished.

935
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:42,182
His mother's back yard?
Not his parent's back yard?

936
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,989
What do you mean?

937
01:07:44,027 --> 01:07:46,462
Was Bobby Henniker's mother married?

938
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:51,991
Well, now that you mention it, I've never
heard anything about Bobby's father.

939
01:07:52,035 --> 01:07:55,403
People always talk as if
it were just Bobby and his mother.

940
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:58,772
I don't really know. Mrs. Henniker
doesn't talk about it herself.

941
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:02,301
I'm just hearing gossip from the locals.

942
01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:04,144
Jonathan...

943
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:09,175
Has David been asking you to do anything
that you don't feel comfortable with?

944
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:12,085
Like give him a blow-job?

945
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:19,694
I assume you can make up
your own mind about sex.

946
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:22,926
I meant, has he been
asking you to do anything

947
01:08:22,966 --> 01:08:25,094
that can get you into
trouble with the law?

948
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:26,101
No.

949
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,763
David already told me
he was in trouble when he was younger.

950
01:08:28,805 --> 01:08:32,400
That doesn't mean he's a troublemaker now.

951
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:36,877
Well, I'm not going to tell you
to stay away from him.

952
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:39,382
But please be careful.

953
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:44,585
Without any return, and without
having made any acquisition...

954
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:56,160
Oh, hello, Elil How are you doing?

955
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:58,429
I'm doing well. How are you?

956
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:01,233
I'm good! Please, come inside.

957
01:09:04,674 --> 01:09:08,406
Your table is finished,
so I thought I'd stop by.

958
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:12,176
And deliver it in person.
I hope you don't mind.

959
01:09:12,215 --> 01:09:15,412
Oh, no! Not at all!
That was really nice of you.

960
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,613
It was no trouble.

961
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,679
Good afternoon, Jonathan.

962
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:25,183
Jonathan, would you mind coming down
and taking this table from Eli?

963
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:29,658
Could I get you some coffee? Or tea?

964
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:31,098
Tea would be nice.

965
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:32,431
I'll be right back.

966
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:37,201
Jonathan, why don't you show Eli
into the living room.

967
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:41,236
This way. Please.

968
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:55,687
Thank you.

969
01:09:56,459 --> 01:09:59,895
I noticed David wasn't in school today.

970
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:03,524
No. He wasn't feeling well this morning.

971
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:08,731
It isn't really healthy
for young boys to be out at all hours,

972
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:10,739
getting into mischief.

973
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:14,835
But maybe you think
I'm a stuffy old man, eh?

974
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:19,337
I suppose at your age,
everything seems like an adventure.

975
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:23,444
Speaking of which -
on David's latest little adventure,

976
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:25,716
he seems to have misplaced something.

977
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:29,555
Something that, well,
really doesn't belong to him.

978
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:32,425
A family heirloom, of sorts.

979
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:36,561
You wouldn't happen
to have seen it, would you?

980
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:39,432
No, I don't think so.

981
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:47,273
Well, perhaps you could
keep an eye out for it.

982
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:52,578
I might even be willing to offer
a small reward for its safe return,

983
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,583
Say a hundred dollars?

984
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:57,177
I'll keep an eye out for it.

985
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,585
Please do.

986
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:02,057
I'm may be getting superstitious
in my old age,

987
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:05,550
But things like this
always strike me as bad omens.

988
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:11,090
As if something awful might happen,
if it doesn't show up soon.

989
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:12,899
Jonathan!

990
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:22,572
Hello, Jonathan.

991
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:27,314
You're okay. You just fainted.

992
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:35,817
Here you go.

993
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,423
Where's Eli?

994
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:39,656
He's gone home.

995
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:42,289
He shouted to me, when you passed out.

996
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,595
Luckily, he had Dr. Marshfield's number.

997
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,899
And she was able
to come out on short notice.

998
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:53,398
How are you feeling, Jonathan?
Are you dizzy? Any headache or nausea?

999
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:56,943
I'm just a little tired.

1000
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:02,316
There does seem to be
a mild flu going around.

1001
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:05,582
Eli's grandson David
hasn't been feeling well, either.

1002
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:09,956
David? I had no idea
he was Eli's grandson.

1003
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:13,154
Jonathan's been hanging out
with him a lot, lately.

1004
01:12:13,196 --> 01:12:16,063
That might explain it, then.

1005
01:12:18,134 --> 01:12:21,695
You should probably stay in bed
for the rest of the day.

1006
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:27,608
I know it's a cliché, but drink
a lot of fluids. It'll help.

1007
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:32,304
I don't think I need that.

1008
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,612
There's nothing
to be afraid of, Jonathan.

1009
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:37,745
This will just
help you sleep for a while.

1010
01:12:37,787 --> 01:12:40,813
He hasn't been sleeping very well
the past few days.

1011
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:44,418
That might be what brought this on...

1012
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:54,136
I'm fine.

1013
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:58,164
Jonathan! You've never had
a problem with shots before.

1014
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:02,838
There. It's all over now.
Just lie back and relax.

1015
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,083
I'm sure he'll be fine.

1016
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:14,556
But don't hesitate to call if he starts
showing any other signs of illness.

1017
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,684
Thanks, Dr. Marshfield.

1018
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,323
Here's my card in case
you need to contact me.

1019
01:13:22,365 --> 01:13:24,663
Great. How much do I owe you?

1020
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,499
Don't worry about it.
The first one's on the house.

1021
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:29,368
That's very nice of you.

1022
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,864
You have a great night.

1023
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:31,871
Likewise.

1024
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,376
Thanks for stopping by.

1025
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:40,013
How are you feeling now?

1026
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:41,778
I'm fine.

1027
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:45,984
Do you think you'll be all right
on your own for a few hours tonight?

1028
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:49,117
I promised Mrs. Henniker
I'd help her with inventory.

1029
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:51,354
I hate leaving you here like this.

1030
01:13:51,394 --> 01:13:52,486
Okay...

1031
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:56,863
I'll probably be back
before you even wake up.

1032
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:17,850
Mom?

1033
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,001
- Jonathan Kelly?
- Yes.

1034
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:43,239
I'm sorry, son.
Your mother's been in an accident.

1035
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:44,168
What?

1036
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:46,057
We're to take you
to the hospital in Everett.

1037
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:48,082
- She's not dead.
- No, but she's hurt pretty bad.

1038
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:51,814
Why don't you get your coat
and come with me.

1039
01:14:56,926 --> 01:14:58,690
(Gangling keys)

1040
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,899
I think I forgot to lock the door.

1041
01:15:12,942 --> 01:15:14,671
It's fine.

1042
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,438
Good evening, Jonathan.

1043
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:23,186
It was a lie.
My mother hasn't been in an accident.

1044
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:24,914
Hasn't she?

1045
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:27,787
I don't play games, Jonathan.

1046
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:31,851
Your mother is in the intensive care
unit at Everett Memorial.

1047
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:34,556
They're not certain
she'll last the night.

1048
01:15:34,597 --> 01:15:35,894
You did it.

1049
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:38,662
As I'm sure my grandson has told you.

1050
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:40,669
He's your son.

1051
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:45,869
He is the son of my daughter;
that makes him my grandson.

1052
01:15:45,908 --> 01:15:51,210
Don't go head to head with me, Jonathan.
You don't know what you're up against.

1053
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:55,946
Now. You're a very smart boy,
and I respect that.

1054
01:15:56,886 --> 01:16:00,447
I'm also certain that David
has put you up to this.

1055
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:05,222
So I am prepared
to give you one final chance.

1056
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:11,399
You have one hour to bring
that skull to me at Corwin House.

1057
01:16:11,434 --> 01:16:15,837
Don't tell me you don't know where it is;
I know you've been there.

1058
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:20,308
If you do exactly as I say
your mother may recover.

1059
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:23,937
If you do not, she will die.

1060
01:16:24,013 --> 01:16:26,141
What about David?

1061
01:16:26,549 --> 01:16:30,918
I will deal with David as I see fit.

1062
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:39,454
You may go.

1063
01:17:05,154 --> 01:17:08,049
Everett Memorial Hospital.
How may I direct your call?

1064
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,702
I need to know if someone was taken
to the emergency room tonight.

1065
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,455
Hold, please.

1066
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,393
<i>ER. How may I help you?</i>

1067
01:17:15,431 --> 01:17:16,431
My name's Jonathan Kelly.

1068
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,743
I'm trying to find out
if my mother was taken there tonight.

1069
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:22,263
I'm really not supposed to give out 
information without proof of your identity.

1070
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,401
She's my mother! You have to tell me!

1071
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,372
Well, what's her first name?

1072
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:27,408
Laura.

1073
01:17:27,443 --> 01:17:28,911
Just a moment.

1074
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:31,845
She's been taken to surgery, Jonathan.

1075
01:17:31,881 --> 01:17:34,350
Is she... how is she?

1076
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:27,028
There is a way out, Jonathan.
For the both of us.

1077
01:19:00,636 --> 01:19:03,537
He's waiting for you downstairs.

1078
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:09,943
Jonathan! So good of you to come.

1079
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:13,176
I assume you've met my apprentice.

1080
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:16,512
Hello, Jonathan.

1081
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:23,785
I believe you have something for me?

1082
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:43,109
Damn! She's blocking me again!

1083
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:48,242
You're the one who dug this up.
Can you identify it?

1084
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:51,753
This is it.

1085
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,846
And you're sure?

1086
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:55,254
Yes.

1087
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:06,625
Salve, antiquissime, te salutamus!

1088
01:20:09,405 --> 01:20:11,897
Salve, antiquissime, te salutamus!

1089
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,830
Ah, yes, our guest of honor.

1090
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:36,228
David?

1091
01:20:38,534 --> 01:20:39,899
Wait!

1092
01:21:03,392 --> 01:21:06,760
I thought you'd like it
if I undressed you, Jonathan.

1093
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:10,754
David, can we get on with this, please?

1094
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:19,970
I've never understood why
he enjoys toying with his kills.

1095
01:21:20,843 --> 01:21:26,338
You should see his little
gallery of the macabre in the forest.

1096
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:22,636
You were never
going to be sacrificed, were you?

1097
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:25,366
No, I was.

1098
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:28,703
Yes, I intended it to be David.

1099
01:22:28,744 --> 01:22:32,078
The ritual needs the blood
of someone with power.

1100
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:34,412
And David is very powerful.

1101
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,919
He's also becoming uncontrollable.

1102
01:22:41,023 --> 01:22:45,392
<i>And when he found out
about it, he became.. Difficult.</i>

1103
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:48,162
Finally, I agreed to spare him,

1104
01:22:48,197 --> 01:22:52,532
On the condition that
he find a suitable replacement.

1105
01:22:56,772 --> 01:22:59,104
Then you came along, Jonathan.

1106
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:03,169
I knew it the moment I saw you.
So much power.

1107
01:23:03,212 --> 01:23:06,045
Someday you could be incredible.

1108
01:23:06,682 --> 01:23:09,344
If you were still alive, that is.

1109
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:13,446
You've already got my blood!
You don't need to kill me!

1110
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:19,360
Oh no, we'll need much more than
those few drops before we're finished.

1111
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:28,832
Salve, magne domine Lucifer,
te salutamus!

1112
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:34,537
Nos adiuvare atque nostros
Investigationem succurrere

1113
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:40,213
et finem subvenire te rogamus.

1114
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:44,609
David, don't do this.

1115
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:48,215
Don't be afraid, Jonathan.

1116
01:23:48,257 --> 01:23:51,090
Pain focuses power, strengthens it.

1117
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,552
Believe me, I know.

1118
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:10,576
Salve amplissime Satan!

1119
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,600
Accipere hoc sacrificium,
consecrare hoc templum, te quaesemus.

1120
01:24:19,288 --> 01:24:22,883
Take this pain and blood in sacrifice!

1121
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:36,102
Expergiscere, nobifis auctor,
te excitamus!

1122
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:41,771
Te salvere jubeo imperator huius mundi!

1123
01:24:43,612 --> 01:24:49,107
<i>Nomini Satan qui eum servimus te petimus
nobiscum vim tuae iterum partior!</i>

1124
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:54,746
Hold stilll If I cut too deep
the skin won't stay together.

1125
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:04,563
Yes!

1126
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:42,235
Salve amplissime Satan!

1127
01:25:43,290 --> 01:25:46,290
Accipere hoc sacrificium,
consecrare hoc templum, te quaesemus.

1128
01:25:50,379 --> 01:25:54,009
Take this pain and blood in sacrifice!

1129
01:25:58,286 --> 01:26:01,119
Expergiscere, nobifis auctor,
te excitamus!

1130
01:26:04,059 --> 01:26:07,290
Te salvere jubeo imperator huius mundi!

1131
01:26:09,931 --> 01:26:15,426
<i>Nomini Satan qui eum servimus te petimus
nobiscum vim tuae iterum partior!</i>

1132
01:26:25,814 --> 01:26:27,179
You!

1133
01:26:29,885 --> 01:26:31,250
Jonathan!

1134
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:40,256
You knew that wasn't Josiah's skull!

1135
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:41,988
Of course.

1136
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,431
What happened to the real one, David?

1137
01:26:44,466 --> 01:26:45,865
I smashed it.

1138
01:26:45,901 --> 01:26:47,869
No! You wouldn't have!

1139
01:26:47,903 --> 01:26:52,136
You're fucked, old man. The pattern's
broken, and you're out of time.

1140
01:26:52,174 --> 01:26:54,142
Put down the knife, David.

1141
01:26:54,176 --> 01:26:58,306
You don't have any power over me
anymore. You're finished!

1142
01:26:58,346 --> 01:26:59,346
Stop him!

1143
01:26:59,381 --> 01:27:01,816
Stay where you are!

1144
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:08,646
You little maggot! I should have killed
you along with your mother!

1145
01:27:43,325 --> 01:27:47,319
Aren't you going to welcome
our illustrious ancestor?

1146
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:52,530
Do it!

1147
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:55,126
Salve, antiquissime, te salutamus.

1148
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:11,815
What now, David? Is it over?

1149
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,685
Almost.

1150
01:28:23,732 --> 01:28:27,726
I'm sorry, Jonathan.
I really do like you.

1151
01:28:27,936 --> 01:28:30,098
More than like you.

1152
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:33,301
But there's only one way
to complete the ritual.

1153
01:28:33,341 --> 01:28:37,209
The ritual is over, David!
Eli's dead now.

1154
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:38,974
Whoever completes the ritual

1155
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:42,382
will have more power
than any single Corwin has ever had.

1156
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:44,010
How can I just throw that away?

1157
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:46,521
David, this is insane.

1158
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:52,922
Lie down on the altar, Jonathan.

1159
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:03,103
I said, lie down!

1160
01:29:03,138 --> 01:29:04,469
No!

1161
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:33,262
It's over, David. Let it go.

1162
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:39,803
Put down the knife, Jonathan.

1163
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,605
Not this time.

1164
01:29:41,643 --> 01:29:43,941
I said, put it down!

1165
01:29:43,979 --> 01:29:46,812
Don't make me do this.

1166
01:30:01,463 --> 01:30:05,457
I guess you're more powerful
than I thought.

1167
01:30:05,767 --> 01:30:08,759
You killed Bobby Henniker, didn't you?

1168
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:11,135
Eli knew he couldn't control you
for much longer,

1169
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:15,131
So he was grooming Bobby to replace you.

1170
01:30:18,647 --> 01:30:23,016
You're so beautiful
when you're about to kill someone.

1171
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:35,593
(car sputtering)

1172
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:44,137
I don't know, Jonathan. Maybe I should
take this back to the dealership.

1173
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:46,869
Maybe it's just a loose heat shield
or something.

1174
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:49,934
I can't believe my insurance company
expects me to be able to replace my car

1175
01:30:49,978 --> 01:30:53,004
for less than two thousand dollars.

1176
01:30:53,048 --> 01:30:54,641
I've got to go, Mom.

1177
01:30:54,683 --> 01:30:56,048
Okay.

1178
01:30:56,718 --> 01:30:59,983
Hey. I wouldn't worry about David.
I'm sure he's fine.

1179
01:31:00,021 --> 01:31:05,118
Maybe he went to visit relatives
and just forgot to tell people in town.

1180
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:06,650
I'll see you after school, Mom.

1181
01:31:06,695 --> 01:31:09,528
Have a good day, hon.

1182
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:37,791
Your Mom's got a real nice car, gay boy.
Know where I can get one like it?

1183
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:39,555
Hey, Webber!

1184
01:31:39,794 --> 01:31:42,855
Get the hell out of here.

1185
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:45,464
Don't worry. He'll be taken care of.
