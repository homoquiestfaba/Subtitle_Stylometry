1
00:00:02,019 --> 00:00:04,487
(arrows whooshing)

2
00:00:12,196 --> 00:00:14,931
(waves crashing)

3
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:26,177
(thudding)

4
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,980
(man laughing)

5
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:32,916
(ominous music)

6
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:39,991
(soft music)
(birds chirping)

7
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:17,786
Hi.

8
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:19,190
Hey.

9
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:22,293
It's colder than you'd think.

10
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,728
Yeah?

11
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:26,997
Yeah. I believe so.

12
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,268
So you can read my mind then?

13
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,872
It's colder than it
looks I should say.

14
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,208
Right. Yeah, I know.

15
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,275
I was kidding.

16
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:43,613
Mm. My tongue is sometimes
faster than my mind, so.

17
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:46,683
Yeah.

18
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:49,987
There's probably a joke in
there somewhere, but not me.

19
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:56,327
Well, I speak a few
languages, so sometimes...

20
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,995
Yeah. You know, it's funny.

21
00:02:58,028 --> 00:03:00,364
I thought I could detect a
little, little accent in there.

22
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:01,865
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:02,898
What is it?

24
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:07,737
French, Italian, little German.

25
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,640
That would've been
my guess, a mix.

26
00:03:11,475 --> 00:03:13,344
Then you should've taken it.

27
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:15,412
Fortune favors the bold.

28
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:16,946
Right.

29
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:17,981
Yeah.

30
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:22,019
That's... It's Latin, isn't it.

31
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,956
Very good. Good for you.

32
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,258
I am a librarian, so...

33
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,294
That's gotta be good
for something, right.

34
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:31,327
Really?

35
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:34,298
You don't look like a librarian.

36
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:39,003
I'll take that as a
compliment, even if it wasn't.

37
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:43,840
You should.

38
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,344
I will.

39
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,279
I will.

40
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:55,252
So you come around
here often, or?

41
00:03:57,388 --> 00:03:58,888
Really?

42
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:01,724
I know that sounds super
corny, but you know, I,

43
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:03,427
I really don't mean
anything by it.

44
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,029
Well, actually I do.

45
00:04:05,062 --> 00:04:07,364
This is kind of my secret spot.

46
00:04:07,398 --> 00:04:08,398
Well, not exactly.

47
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:10,433
I know about it.

48
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,870
I mean, from my
husband, my family.

49
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,773
I come out here to read, relax.

50
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:18,375
Like that makes sense.

51
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:20,044
Sure. No, no, I get it.

52
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,782
Well I'm, I'm finished.

53
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:27,384
I'm gonna go.

54
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:29,086
Enjoy.

55
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,321
That's...

56
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,489
You don't have to, you know,

57
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,358
if you're not in a
hurry or anything.

58
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:37,894
Thank you.

59
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:39,762
But, I gotta go.

60
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:43,133
It's a lovely beach.
Enjoy your day.

61
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:47,904
I'm Marilyn, by the way.

62
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:50,006
Connor.

63
00:04:50,975 --> 00:04:51,975
Good name.

64
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,875
Thanks.

65
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:55,346
You too.

66
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,215
(unsettling music)

67
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,056
Can you help me?

68
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,391
Sure.

69
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:41,458
What can I do?

70
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,094
You again.

71
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,097
Yes, it's me.

72
00:05:48,198 --> 00:05:49,500
You gotta stop following me.

73
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:51,068
(both chuckling)

74
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,101
I'm kidding.

75
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:54,237
How are you?

76
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:57,107
Going all right I suppose.

77
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:00,910
Now that I'm not so
sure I can believe.

78
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:04,481
(scoffs) You're very perceptive.

79
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:10,154
It's kind of obvious,
the way that you said that.

80
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,458
Plus with those on.

81
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:15,526
Oh.

82
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:22,099
If you're gonna say

83
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,301
you ran into a door
frame, please don't.

84
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,304
I won't believe you.

85
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:31,175
I was gonna say cabinet,
but I guess you're right.

86
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,343
I'm not so okay.

87
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,179
I'm really sorry.

88
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:36,513
No, it's not your fault.

89
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:38,915
Well, that's good.

90
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:43,886
Maybe I can be the solution.

91
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:46,589
Maybe.

92
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:53,230
Anyway, I suppose
in a way it was you.

93
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:56,100
Um?

94
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:57,133
At the beach.

95
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,371
I just took too much
time talking to you

96
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:02,872
and I was late
getting home, so...

97
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:06,510
Oh my god. I'm so...

98
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:08,212
What?
- Connor?

99
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:09,622
When you're done in there,
could you come here, please?

100
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:11,115
Take over at the desk?

101
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:12,583
Absolutely.

102
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:14,952
Just a minute, I'm
helping somebody here.

103
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
She's your boss?

104
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:20,257
No, just some old lady.

105
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,492
I've been fucking.

106
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:22,925
(both laughing)

107
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,596
Exactly what I
was imagining, yes.

108
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:26,997
Yeah.
- I'm really glad

109
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,041
that that's what
went into your mind.

110
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:29,065
That's good.

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,368
Yeah, she's one of several.

112
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,303
That you're fucking?

113
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:38,375
No. Bosses.

114
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:39,309
Oh, right.

115
00:07:39,343 --> 00:07:40,677
Well, she sure sounds like it.

116
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,212
That she does.

117
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:48,252
Anyways, you're
here, where I work.

118
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:49,285
How can I help you?

119
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:52,122
You looking for
anything particular?

120
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,058
Something about murder.

121
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:56,092
Are you serious?

122
00:07:57,194 --> 00:07:59,563
To read. I mean, a
story about murder.

123
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:00,431
Right? Yeah.

124
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:01,665
Yeah.
- Not the act.

125
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:02,733
Not the actual.
- No.

126
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:03,933
That's yeah.

127
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,470
Yeah. That one.

128
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:11,542
[Boss] Connor?

129
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:15,646
I'm getting the... Cat
call from my fuck buddy.

130
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:16,580
So-
- No, I know.

131
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:17,981
I'm so sorry. That's my fault.

132
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:19,259
No, please. Don't
worry about it.

133
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:21,385
I'd sit here all day and
talk to you if I could.

134
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:25,622
- I understand.
- Yeah.

135
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:28,625
Anyways, I'll go
ahead and take you

136
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:31,295
to the crime section
and you can go ahead

137
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:32,262
and take it from there.

138
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:33,430
- Thank you.
- Cool.

139
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:41,572
I'm sure you'll find what
you're looking for up here.

140
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,540
Mysteries, thrillers,
that kinda thing.

141
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,643
It's kind of our
bread and butter.

142
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:48,612
What with the name of
our town and everything.

143
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:49,613
[Marilyn] What's that?

144
00:08:49,646 --> 00:08:50,681
[Connor] Twin Oaks.

145
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:53,283
It's the name of the cafe

146
00:08:53,317 --> 00:08:55,018
in <i>The Postman</i>
<i>Always Rings Twice</i>.

147
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:56,220
[Marilyn] Oh.

148
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,555
[Connor] Trust
me. It's a good one.

149
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:01,757
Here we are.

150
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:04,328
Alright. Thank you.

151
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:05,361
No problem.

152
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,600
You looking for
anything in particular?

153
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,402
Not really, something
for the beach.

154
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,770
The beach.

155
00:09:16,573 --> 00:09:17,817
Preferably one where
the husband dies.

156
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:19,676
Ah, yeah.

157
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,112
One of those, of course.

158
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,790
Yeah, don't wanna ruin
your reading experience,

159
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,617
but just about every other
one ends that way, so...

160
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,684
- Good.
- Yeah.

161
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:29,253
I'll have my pick then.

162
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:30,286
Yes, you will.

163
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:35,526
Um, I should really
get back down.

164
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,693
Oh, yes.

165
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:38,262
Thank you again.

166
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:39,730
No problem.

167
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:40,763
Take care.

168
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,734
It's good to see you again.

169
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:44,767
You too.

170
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:50,741
I feel the same.

171
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,343
What's that?

172
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:59,082
I'd like to talk to you
too all day if I could.

173
00:09:59,116 --> 00:10:02,452
(gentle music)

174
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:03,486
Okay.

175
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:25,776
- Hey.
- Hey.

176
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:31,147
Two by Kane.

177
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,483
Good choice.
- Yes.

178
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:36,520
Hmm. I got a tip from a friend.

179
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:43,327
They seem to have good
taste, this friend of yours.

180
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,228
I'd trust him from
now on if I were you.

181
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:46,262
Hmm.

182
00:10:47,464 --> 00:10:49,399
That one looks pretty good too.

183
00:10:49,433 --> 00:10:51,635
Yeah. You know, not too bad.

184
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:02,746
Thanks. But we're really not
supposed to take any tips.

185
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:05,382
Go ahead. Take it.

186
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,584
You sure?

187
00:11:07,618 --> 00:11:09,519
I mean, I don't wanna
take your last dollar.

188
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:11,788
I insist.

189
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:16,727
Use it.

190
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Don't spend it.

191
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:19,795
You understand?

192
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:25,435
(thoughtful music)

193
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:30,641
(door chimes clattering)

194
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,233
Oh hey man.
Thank you for coming.

195
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,266
Really.

196
00:11:57,969 --> 00:11:59,236
I'm really sorry.

197
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:00,804
Oh no, please.

198
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:01,805
You cool. You good?

199
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:05,809
Yeah. It's just, you know...
(phone vibrates)

200
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:07,244
Shit. I'm sorry.

201
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:12,984
I just had to stay a little
later than I thought.

202
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:14,451
No, please.

203
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,653
I mean, my time is
your time, right?

204
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:17,797
That's not what I'm saying.

205
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,866
I'm just saying, you know,
we had a little extra work

206
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,692
Well, I, I kind
of think you are.

207
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:23,860
I mean you waltz in here

208
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:26,296
anytime you feel
like it all casual.

209
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,899
I mean kind of makes a
pretty big statement.

210
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:31,701
Sorry.

211
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,371
What I meant to say is honestly,

212
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:37,374
I'm late because of my job,

213
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:39,676
which I'm supposed
to have, so...

214
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:44,848
(laughs) Um, are you trying
to piss me off right now?

215
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:46,316
- No.
- I mean is that

216
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,484
what you're doing?
- No.

217
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,652
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Stop.

218
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,253
Ow!
- Kinda seems like you are.

219
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:51,898
No, no, 'cause if you
want me to sit here all day

220
00:12:51,922 --> 00:12:54,591
with my dick down your throat,
I can definitely do that.

221
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:55,492
- No, that-
- No, all you gotta do

222
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,460
is say, so.

223
00:12:56,493 --> 00:12:58,862
That is not necessary, sir.

224
00:12:58,895 --> 00:13:00,064
Oh, I, I like that.

225
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:02,632
The sir thing you just did
there, that's not even required,

226
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,534
but that shows respect.

227
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:05,769
That's real good.

228
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:07,537
- Thanks.
- Well, you're very welcome.

229
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:10,041
But seriously, just let me know

230
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:11,751
if you need me to come
out here more often,

231
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:13,810
so you can suck on my cock

232
00:13:13,844 --> 00:13:15,455
to help you recall the
reason that we need

233
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,547
to keep having these
little meet ups.

234
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:18,682
What do you think?

235
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:22,419
A fucking asshole.

236
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:23,854
- Yep.
- Jesus.

237
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:27,457
Talking like that
in a family place.

238
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:28,491
Yep. I know.

239
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:32,896
Hey boys. Hey.

240
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:34,841
Yeah, you were great in
<i>Deliverance,</i> by the way.

241
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:36,867
What the fuck's that mean?

242
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,935
- Um, it means show me.
- What?

243
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,904
Show me one family in
here, I'll walk over,

244
00:13:40,937 --> 00:13:42,606
I'll apologize to 'em.

245
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,009
I'll say I am very sorry
for using such bad words.

246
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,710
Come on, show me.

247
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:51,915
Yeah, that's what I thought.

248
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:53,493
So why don't you go back to
eating your $3 breakfast.

249
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:55,418
Stay outta my god
damn business. Okay?

250
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,421
Yeah. Maybe we don't
feel like it, bitch.

251
00:13:59,523 --> 00:14:00,891
Oh, is that right?

252
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:01,924
Oh boy.

253
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,427
That's really
interesting. Okay.

254
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:06,296
See if you can guess
what this means.

255
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:08,899
Whoops.

256
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,401
You know what that means,
what I just did there?

257
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,937
That means I'm a state
appointed law officer.

258
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:16,007
And I don't like the
way you're looking at me

259
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,341
or listening in on my
conversation over there.

260
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,411
Conversation that I'm
having with a known felon.

261
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,880
Sorry. That's my bad.

262
00:14:23,914 --> 00:14:25,549
So take down my badge number.

263
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:26,917
You can write up a complaint,

264
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,585
send it off to Providence
if you want to.

265
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,554
But while I'm here in your...

266
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:33,590
god this is a shitty little
candy corn eating town,

267
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,992
you'll shut the fuck up

268
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:36,994
and you'll mind your
own god damn business.

269
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:41,966
Is that clear enough
for you, blubber boy?

270
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:46,469
Yeah.

271
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:47,470
Yeah. I get it.

272
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:48,772
That's great.

273
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,107
How are you there, Dumb Shit?

274
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:52,876
[Man In Cap]
Yeah. I, I hear ya.

275
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:55,412
That's great. You guys both
get gold stars for the day.

276
00:14:56,147 --> 00:14:58,582
Pay the bill, meet me outside.

277
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:01,384
(plate clatters)

278
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,933
Gee, I hope I wasn't too rude
to your cousins in there.

279
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:18,088
No, that was totally fine.

280
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:21,771
You have a real natural
charm about yourself.

281
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:23,740
I think you really
got through to 'em.

282
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:24,908
Yeah, I felt like we had

283
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:26,541
a real connection
going at the end there.

284
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:28,712
Anyway. You okay?

285
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:31,115
You need anything? You
got any questions for me?

286
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:32,149
No.

287
00:15:32,183 --> 00:15:33,650
Are you sure?

288
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,827
You're not fucking up are you?

289
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:37,955
Doing anything stupid, 'cause
you know I'll find out.

290
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:38,989
I'm sure.

291
00:15:40,091 --> 00:15:43,194
It's the hardest time, first
six months of being free.

292
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:44,628
But we got your good job, right?

293
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:46,030
I mean you're not
digging ditches.

294
00:15:46,063 --> 00:15:47,098
Yeah.

295
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:49,733
I like you Bates. I really do.

296
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:52,136
But don't you ever
force my hand.

297
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:53,803
'Cause I will come down on you

298
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:57,008
like the fucking staff of
Moses right across your skull.

299
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,775
I swear to god I will.

300
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:00,144
Just so you know.

301
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:04,081
I understand, Sir.

302
00:16:04,115 --> 00:16:07,018
See, I really,
I really do like that.

303
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:09,686
Keep that up. We're gonna
do just fine, you and me.

304
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,719
Thank you.

305
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:13,490
See you next week, yeah?

306
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:14,724
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

307
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:16,927
I really don't give
a shit about excuses.

308
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:18,162
So you be on time.

309
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:20,164
Or you'll be driving
out to see me instead.

310
00:16:20,197 --> 00:16:21,665
And I don't believe
there's anybody

311
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:23,200
in that whole god damn county

312
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:26,937
who's very eager to see
your stupid ass face again.

313
00:16:26,971 --> 00:16:28,705
You hear, you hear me?
- I do.

314
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,241
No, no.

315
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:31,274
Don't touch the car.

316
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:34,045
- Sorry.
- Later.

317
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:35,545
Later Jock. Thank you.

318
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,850
(engine cranks)

319
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:55,498
(phone rings)

320
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:08,179
Hello?

321
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:10,147
Hello.

322
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,221
Hey, it's me, Connor.

323
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:23,227
I did what you asked.

324
00:17:25,662 --> 00:17:27,530
I didn't ask you.

325
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:28,564
I told you.

326
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:32,901
Good point.

327
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,072
So yeah.

328
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:38,109
Hello.

329
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:39,142
[Connor] <i>Hi there.</i>

330
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:42,579
Where are you right
now, at work or at home?

331
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:47,985
Not at work but
not at home either.

332
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:53,157
Hm don't tell me you're
with her right now.

333
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,093
<i>Your boss.</i>

334
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:57,861
Oh yeah. Right.

335
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,032
No, I just left her
place a while ago.

336
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:02,066
<i>She's exhausting.</i>

337
00:18:06,203 --> 00:18:08,205
I can only imagine.

338
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:09,240
God please don't.

339
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:15,212
Now what?

340
00:18:15,246 --> 00:18:16,913
<i>I'd like to see you...</i>

341
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:19,681
again.

342
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:24,754
Yes, I figured that much.

343
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:25,822
Yeah. Right.

344
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,958
Okay. (laughs)

345
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:30,827
Yeah, so that, yeah.

346
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:37,934
Well I can't right now.
I'm with my daughter.

347
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:41,305
Oh.

348
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:46,277
That's, I didn't know
you had a daughter.

349
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:48,878
[Marilyn] I don't.

350
00:18:48,912 --> 00:18:50,680
[Connor] <i>Okay.</i>
<i>Now I'm confused.</i>

351
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:53,284
<i>She's my stepdaughter,</i>

352
00:18:53,317 --> 00:18:55,019
but she's here with me.

353
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:58,155
Got it. Okay.

354
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,727
And so there's no way you can...

355
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:06,930
None.

356
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:08,865
We're waiting for
her father to arrive

357
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,034
and I need to be here.

358
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:15,805
And this is the
guy, who's been...

359
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,410
<i>The bruise.</i>

360
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:23,380
I can't discuss it right now.

361
00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:27,118
Understood.

362
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:28,151
Alright.

363
00:19:34,191 --> 00:19:36,926
I would like to
see you again though,

364
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:38,162
even though I shouldn't.

365
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:41,631
That would be great.

366
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:44,401
Really, really great.

367
00:19:47,004 --> 00:19:50,307
Okay, well thank you for
calling and I'll let you know.

368
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:52,510
Alright. Yeah.

369
00:19:52,543 --> 00:19:54,979
Let me know if you want to
set up a time or whatever.

370
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:56,413
(phone clicks)

371
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:10,461
(siren wails)

372
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:11,996
What are you doing here?

373
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,400
Sitting.

374
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,768
No loitering in the premises.

375
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:19,801
I'm not.

376
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:22,373
Sitting is loitering, son.

377
00:20:24,341 --> 00:20:27,111
I was just on a
phone call. That's all.

378
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:29,079
Then I'm going for a jog.

379
00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:30,181
Is that right?

380
00:20:30,214 --> 00:20:32,815
- Yeah.
- Park closes at 6:00.

381
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:34,418
I'll be long gone by then.

382
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:37,054
Says you and I don't
give a shit what you say.

383
00:20:39,923 --> 00:20:40,923
Okay.

384
00:20:45,762 --> 00:20:46,762
Shit.

385
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,306
I know who you are by the way.

386
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:56,473
Yeah?

387
00:20:56,507 --> 00:20:57,907
You hear what I said?

388
00:20:57,941 --> 00:20:58,875
Yeah.

389
00:20:58,908 --> 00:20:59,510
Don't get smart with me.

390
00:20:59,543 --> 00:21:01,445
I'm not. I said, yeah.

391
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:02,478
All right then.

392
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,449
And you know who my
fucking nephew is, right?

393
00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:08,418
Yes I do.

394
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:14,124
So you're a tough guy, huh?

395
00:21:14,158 --> 00:21:15,359
No.

396
00:21:15,392 --> 00:21:16,893
Yeah. You sure you
wanna feel tough?

397
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:17,860
Why don't you try
getting tough with me?

398
00:21:17,894 --> 00:21:18,996
See what happens.

399
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,464
I'm not a tough guy, sir.

400
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,343
They got you good, didn't they?

401
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,269
Oh yes they did.

402
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:26,370
Yes. They did.

403
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:28,272
Six o'clock be gone.

404
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:30,241
I'll be swinging
back by here soon.

405
00:21:32,142 --> 00:21:33,444
They lock the gates out front.

406
00:21:35,412 --> 00:21:36,412
I know they do.

407
00:21:37,448 --> 00:21:38,525
Yeah, you think you know a lot,

408
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:41,452
but you don't know
shit, asshole.

409
00:21:41,485 --> 00:21:43,820
(sad music)

410
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,440
(Connor groans)

411
00:22:21,492 --> 00:22:23,826
- Hey Kim.
- Yep.

412
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,095
I can finish up up here

413
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:26,964
if you want to go do
the poetry section.

414
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:28,432
Are you sure?

415
00:22:28,465 --> 00:22:31,402
Yeah. It's the other one
they want redone today, so...

416
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:32,569
Okay.

417
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,505
But that's a lot
smaller than up here.

418
00:22:34,538 --> 00:22:36,073
That doesn't seem fair.

419
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,475
Hey, I'm not always
so magnanimous.

420
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:40,277
So grab it while you can.

421
00:22:40,311 --> 00:22:41,211
Fine.

422
00:22:41,245 --> 00:22:42,812
I'm just gonna go put these.

423
00:23:10,574 --> 00:23:12,576
Hey, what are you
doing after work?

424
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:13,977
Um...

425
00:23:16,013 --> 00:23:18,082
Let me guess, going for a run.

426
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:20,651
Probably.

427
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:22,252
Yep.

428
00:23:22,286 --> 00:23:23,187
Geez.

429
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,555
You really love it. Don't you?

430
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:26,657
I guess so.

431
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,592
It's kind of a
habit at this point.

432
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,960
You sure you're not out there

433
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:32,996
training for the next Olympics?

434
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,498
Yeah.

435
00:23:34,531 --> 00:23:37,968
I gave up on that idea in
about the eighth grade.

436
00:23:39,603 --> 00:23:41,038
I just do it for fun now.

437
00:23:42,106 --> 00:23:43,106
I run too.

438
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:47,211
- Do you?
- Yeah.

439
00:23:47,244 --> 00:23:49,046
Well I, I jog anyway.

440
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,883
Oh, that's um, cool.

441
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:55,619
Yeah.

442
00:23:55,652 --> 00:23:57,621
We should go together sometime.

443
00:23:57,654 --> 00:23:58,689
Yeah.

444
00:23:58,722 --> 00:24:02,359
Yeah. That'd be,
um, it'd be cool.

445
00:24:02,393 --> 00:24:03,627
Yeah. Only if you want to.

446
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,629
I know it's nice to
run alone sometimes,

447
00:24:05,662 --> 00:24:08,432
but I would be up for it.

448
00:24:08,465 --> 00:24:10,534
Yeah, no, no, no, no.

449
00:24:11,568 --> 00:24:13,036
Yeah. Let's.

450
00:24:14,071 --> 00:24:15,071
Cool.

451
00:24:17,508 --> 00:24:20,244
(romantic music)

452
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:38,095
Oh, that's uh, what's her name?

453
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,697
[Connor] Who?

454
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,267
Astrid, I think or
something like that.

455
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,305
She's in the Pilates class I
take and she's kind of a bitch.

456
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:52,643
She's pretty and all that,
but she's not very nice.

457
00:24:52,676 --> 00:24:53,943
Not to me anyway.

458
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:56,647
That's 'cause you're pretty.

459
00:24:59,316 --> 00:25:00,551
Thanks.

460
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,553
Yeah, you know, I mean
that's like what happens

461
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,721
when two pretty girls meet.

462
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:08,392
You know, it's like two
tigers in the wild there.

463
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,129
Like animals chasing after.

464
00:25:14,064 --> 00:25:15,632
Not that I think you're a...

465
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:16,700
An animal.

466
00:25:18,235 --> 00:25:19,235
I'm done.

467
00:25:21,138 --> 00:25:23,540
You go ahead and
take care of poetry

468
00:25:23,574 --> 00:25:26,743
and I'll take care
of those ladies.

469
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:28,178
That sounds good.

470
00:25:28,212 --> 00:25:30,781
And thank you for
the compliment.

471
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:31,814
I think.

472
00:25:32,683 --> 00:25:33,717
Yeah.

473
00:25:44,728 --> 00:25:45,496
Hi.

474
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:46,396
[Connor] Hi.

475
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,365
I'm looking for a
book about Chanel.

476
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:50,234
Do you have anything
like that here?

477
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:54,505
Do you mean the company
or the woman herself?

478
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,074
Um...

479
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:59,243
Maybe a little bit of
both, like a biography?

480
00:25:59,276 --> 00:26:00,477
Yeah.

481
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:02,646
I'm doing a paper on
her. It's for school.

482
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:03,580
Yeah.

483
00:26:03,614 --> 00:26:04,757
We should have something for you

484
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:06,683
in the fashion
section downstairs.

485
00:26:06,717 --> 00:26:07,727
Would you like me to show you?

486
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:09,186
Great.

487
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:12,256
Um, could you actually
go for me please?

488
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:14,124
I just wanna send some emails.

489
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,301
[Marilyn] Shouldn't
you be doing the work

490
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:17,227
since it's for your class?

491
00:26:17,261 --> 00:26:18,261
Please?

492
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,198
- Sure.
- Thank you.

493
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:22,475
Hey, we need to hurry.
Alright?

494
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:25,435
We're meeting your father in
an hour at the club for dinner.

495
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:26,637
Gross.

496
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,238
I thought you
liked eating there.

497
00:26:28,272 --> 00:26:30,274
Yeah, I wasn't
talking about the club.

498
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:38,347
Hello again.

499
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:40,416
Hi there.

500
00:26:41,818 --> 00:26:43,787
I sure am glad we're the
only library in town.

501
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,423
(laughs) Me too.

502
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:50,627
Your eye looks much better.

503
00:26:54,431 --> 00:26:56,733
[Marilyn] You wanna show me
where I could find the book?

504
00:26:58,735 --> 00:26:59,735
Happy to.

505
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:02,773
Come on down.

506
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:09,746
Hey Kim, I'm gonna show
this lady the downstairs.

507
00:27:10,514 --> 00:27:12,416
Would you keep an eye
on the front for me?

508
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:13,850
Sure. No problem.

509
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:14,884
Great.

510
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,458
So this is the lower level.

511
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:26,597
Got our plays, entertainment
stuff, all that crap.

512
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,632
There's some good
stuff too though.

513
00:27:28,665 --> 00:27:30,334
Rare books are over there.

514
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:31,268
Mm.

515
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:32,536
I love the smell of old books.

516
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,204
Ah, so do I.

517
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:35,448
Believe it or not a
million years ago

518
00:27:35,472 --> 00:27:38,609
I was an English
major, but yeah.

519
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,513
Anyways, I'm gonna go
take a look for your book.

520
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:53,624
(romantic music)

521
00:27:53,657 --> 00:27:54,658
Here you go.

522
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:57,694
Thank you.

523
00:27:57,728 --> 00:27:58,728
No problem.

524
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,830
It's my job.

525
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,505
I didn't mean for the book.

526
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:39,236
(music intensifies)

527
00:28:56,853 --> 00:28:58,755
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

528
00:29:06,763 --> 00:29:09,366
(Connor sighs)

529
00:29:15,973 --> 00:29:18,842
(table squeaks)

530
00:29:24,915 --> 00:29:27,517
(Connor sighs)

531
00:29:56,747 --> 00:29:58,749
I hope to see you again.

532
00:29:58,782 --> 00:30:00,450
Oh my god, me too.

533
00:30:03,988 --> 00:30:06,023
[Woman] Marilyn.

534
00:30:06,057 --> 00:30:07,324
I'm coming.

535
00:30:31,115 --> 00:30:33,383
[Kim] So how was your day off?

536
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:34,818
- Yeah, pretty good.
- Hmm.

537
00:30:34,851 --> 00:30:37,554
[Connor] You know,
caught up on some laundry,

538
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:40,390
read some Vonnegut
ran, you know.

539
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:41,691
[Kim] Wait, you ran?

540
00:30:42,793 --> 00:30:43,860
Shocking.
- Yeah, stop.

541
00:30:45,629 --> 00:30:47,831
[Kim] Oh hey, guess who
I saw yesterday after work?

542
00:30:47,864 --> 00:30:49,399
- Who?
- Jared Clifton.

543
00:30:51,668 --> 00:30:53,004
[Connor] Really?

544
00:30:53,037 --> 00:30:55,472
Yeah. I haven't heard that
name in a long, long time.

545
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:57,008
Oh I know.

546
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:59,876
And you will never believe
who he's going out with.

547
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,744
Who?

548
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:02,217
Girl from my
Pilates class, Astrid.

549
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,092
You know the one you
helped her and her mom

550
00:31:05,116 --> 00:31:07,851
find the book, they're together.

551
00:31:07,884 --> 00:31:08,884
Jared and Astrid.

552
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:10,787
- Really?
- Yeah.

553
00:31:13,657 --> 00:31:15,026
- Wow.
- I know.

554
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:17,995
That's what I've been hearing.

555
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:21,464
And people have seen them
around together for a while.

556
00:31:21,498 --> 00:31:25,569
And then I saw him pick her
up yesterday after class

557
00:31:25,602 --> 00:31:27,871
in a really nice car.

558
00:31:27,904 --> 00:31:29,339
Wasn't his, I'm sure of it.

559
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,475
She's been living
here for a while.

560
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:33,978
Apparently her
dad is really rich

561
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:35,980
and he had a bunch
of houses everywhere.

562
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:38,815
La-di-da, but yeah.

563
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:42,086
That's who she's
dating: Jared Clifton.

564
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,589
(scoffs) Can you even imagine?

565
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:47,992
I mean he's older than us.

566
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:50,760
Shit.

567
00:31:50,794 --> 00:31:51,794
Yep.

568
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,598
That's...

569
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,102
- What?
- Nothing.

570
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,570
I mean, who am I
to judge? Right?

571
00:32:00,604 --> 00:32:02,073
Oh please.

572
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:04,741
Seriously.

573
00:32:04,774 --> 00:32:06,077
You're nothing like him.

574
00:32:08,012 --> 00:32:09,046
Connor.

575
00:32:11,048 --> 00:32:14,818
Okay. You did something and
you got punished for it.

576
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:15,996
You're not a complete low life,

577
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,721
piece of shit,
dick face like him.

578
00:32:18,889 --> 00:32:21,092
I mean it, there's a difference.

579
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,135
Well, I'm glad you
don't have an opinion

580
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,393
about the subject.

581
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:26,097
But he is though.

582
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,032
And you know that.

583
00:32:28,065 --> 00:32:30,567
Do I? Mm hmm.

584
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:33,769
Connor?

585
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:39,010
(suspenseful music)

586
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,761
[Marilyn] I was wondering
if you'd come or not.

587
00:33:31,795 --> 00:33:32,795
Are you joking?

588
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:35,899
You called. So I came.

589
00:33:39,569 --> 00:33:42,273
You do like older
women, don't you?

590
00:33:42,306 --> 00:33:45,142
I can't think about another
person since I met you.

591
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,877
Yeah?

592
00:33:47,911 --> 00:33:50,181
Not even the pretty
girl you work with?

593
00:33:50,214 --> 00:33:51,648
Kim?

594
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:54,018
That's... No way.

595
00:33:56,087 --> 00:33:57,088
You sure?

596
00:33:58,155 --> 00:33:59,823
She sure looked
interested in you.

597
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:02,791
I'm sure.

598
00:34:05,062 --> 00:34:06,596
Not about her liking me.

599
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:10,001
I mean about me liking you.

600
00:34:11,268 --> 00:34:12,236
Good.

601
00:34:12,269 --> 00:34:14,271
I was jealous.

602
00:34:14,305 --> 00:34:16,240
Seriously? That's insane.

603
00:34:17,874 --> 00:34:20,044
It's nothing of the kind.

604
00:34:20,077 --> 00:34:21,077
Trust me.

605
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,981
If you only knew my thoughts.

606
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:28,085
I want you to
whisper them to me.

607
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,887
(romantic music)

608
00:35:03,954 --> 00:35:06,556
(both moaning)

609
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,299
(Connor moans)

610
00:35:51,868 --> 00:35:53,304
I never want this to end.

611
00:35:54,972 --> 00:35:55,972
Me neither.

612
00:36:01,278 --> 00:36:02,879
Too bad it's impossible.

613
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:05,381
Is it?

614
00:36:07,684 --> 00:36:09,386
Hmm. You know that.

615
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:13,656
You know that.

616
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,126
No, I don't.

617
00:36:16,427 --> 00:36:17,760
I don't know anything about you.

618
00:36:17,794 --> 00:36:19,263
So how could I
possibly know that?

619
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:24,969
I'm the same with you.

620
00:36:31,342 --> 00:36:36,347
But I love the way you
look, the way you are.

621
00:36:37,114 --> 00:36:38,114
Thanks.

622
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:40,782
That's...

623
00:36:42,086 --> 00:36:43,086
What?

624
00:36:45,256 --> 00:36:46,656
Just...

625
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:51,428
Words I haven't heard
in a long, long time.

626
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:59,270
Well, I would tell
them to you every day,

627
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:01,105
if you were mine.

628
00:37:01,905 --> 00:37:04,908
Well I like the sound of that.

629
00:37:04,941 --> 00:37:05,941
Of what?

630
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,510
Being yours.

631
00:37:13,017 --> 00:37:14,017
If only.

632
00:37:18,956 --> 00:37:20,457
Because of your husband?

633
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:24,061
Is that really it?

634
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,865
'Cause of that and so much more.

635
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:32,269
It's not just about me.

636
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,270
Astrid.

637
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:37,807
I'd be afraid for her.

638
00:37:40,444 --> 00:37:42,279
I don't understand.

639
00:37:50,887 --> 00:37:52,423
The times that he's hit me,

640
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:55,392
the bruises you've seen,

641
00:37:59,063 --> 00:38:04,801
most of them I got
trying to protect her.

642
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:08,105
(ominous tones)

643
00:38:08,138 --> 00:38:09,139
Oh my god.

644
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:17,046
Fuck that.

645
00:38:17,947 --> 00:38:18,947
Fuck that.

646
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:20,882
Turn him in.

647
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:23,454
I mean do it today. I'm serious.

648
00:38:23,487 --> 00:38:24,887
It's not that simple.

649
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:26,490
Yes it is.

650
00:38:26,523 --> 00:38:27,523
It is that simple.

651
00:38:29,493 --> 00:38:30,903
Call the police when
you've done something wrong

652
00:38:30,927 --> 00:38:32,895
and trust me, things
happen really fast.

653
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:33,929
I would know.

654
00:38:35,566 --> 00:38:37,301
What do you mean you would know?

655
00:38:37,334 --> 00:38:39,436
This isn't about
me right now, so.

656
00:38:40,504 --> 00:38:41,904
I don't care.

657
00:38:41,938 --> 00:38:44,308
You say something
like this, tell me.

658
00:38:44,341 --> 00:38:46,010
I don't want to let us go.

659
00:38:46,043 --> 00:38:50,314
Oh, you won't.
Just tell me the truth.

660
00:39:00,457 --> 00:39:03,961
Couple years ago,
almost four now,

661
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:07,463
I was going to college upstate

662
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:13,903
and I got invited to
this family gathering,

663
00:39:15,339 --> 00:39:16,507
4th of July celebration.

664
00:39:19,543 --> 00:39:22,613
Yeah, so this is my great
uncle who invited me, you know,

665
00:39:22,646 --> 00:39:24,548
he lived up by where
I went to school.

666
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,360
Even though I don't really
know these relatives,

667
00:39:27,384 --> 00:39:31,288
I figure worst case
I get some free food,

668
00:39:31,322 --> 00:39:34,291
some booze, you know,
fireworks, all that.

669
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:37,394
So. Yeah.

670
00:39:38,895 --> 00:39:40,564
I'm up for it. I go.

671
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:46,470
And then, this one guy shows up.

672
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:50,074
Friend of a friend.

673
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:54,144
Kevin Edmunds.

674
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:58,948
Kevin starts picking
on this girl.

675
00:40:00,517 --> 00:40:03,153
Friend of one of the kids there.

676
00:40:03,187 --> 00:40:06,357
And went up to him
and I said, "Stop it."

677
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,426
You know, stop.

678
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:18,001
And he laughed and
he said, "Make me."

679
00:40:19,536 --> 00:40:20,971
Just like that.

680
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:25,342
And that was it.

681
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:28,945
I just...

682
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:32,549
I pushed him.

683
00:40:34,585 --> 00:40:36,620
Kevin fell back and hit
his head on the corner

684
00:40:36,653 --> 00:40:39,590
of a concrete drinking
fountain on the golf course.

685
00:40:44,061 --> 00:40:45,061
He never got up.

686
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:50,601
He didn't die or anything
like that, you know.

687
00:40:52,102 --> 00:40:58,308
He's had very serious
mental, physical.

688
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:08,085
They threw me in
jail for three years,

689
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,688
three years for
pushing somebody.

690
00:41:17,694 --> 00:41:20,397
And, you know, obviously

691
00:41:21,365 --> 00:41:24,001
by then I had
dropped outta school.

692
00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:27,738
So I moved back in with my mom,

693
00:41:27,771 --> 00:41:29,473
started living in her basement.

694
00:41:29,506 --> 00:41:31,484
I got a job at the library
because that's just about

695
00:41:31,508 --> 00:41:33,744
the only place
that would hire me.

696
00:41:33,777 --> 00:41:35,712
Yeah. (laughs)

697
00:41:37,714 --> 00:41:39,216
Cue the fucking violins.

698
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:40,150
No.

699
00:41:40,184 --> 00:41:43,654
(romantic music)

700
00:41:43,687 --> 00:41:44,687
Well, you failed.

701
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,090
How's that?

702
00:41:48,692 --> 00:41:50,461
You failed to scare me away.

703
00:42:08,645 --> 00:42:10,347
So when can I see you again?

704
00:42:13,684 --> 00:42:14,985
Can I see you again?

705
00:42:17,154 --> 00:42:18,154
I hope so.

706
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,527
I don't take anything
for granted anymore.

707
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,729
So, I hope so too.

708
00:42:27,331 --> 00:42:28,331
I understand.

709
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:32,535
So?

710
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:38,575
I'll call you, soon, I promise.

711
00:42:43,714 --> 00:42:45,649
That's all I can say right now.

712
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:48,418
Well, I guess that's something.

713
00:42:52,356 --> 00:42:53,624
Oh shit.

714
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:54,791
You all right?

715
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:56,059
Yeah. No.

716
00:42:57,561 --> 00:43:00,631
It's just, my keys.

717
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,477
My dad gave me this
little key chain

718
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:06,436
when I graduated high school.

719
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,804
It's an Indian head nickel.

720
00:43:09,306 --> 00:43:10,807
Anyways, the tip
of it is broken.

721
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:13,210
So the keys always slip off.

722
00:43:13,243 --> 00:43:15,812
And I think they
did when we were...

723
00:43:15,846 --> 00:43:17,180
I'm sorry.

724
00:43:17,214 --> 00:43:18,214
Yeah, it's okay.

725
00:43:19,283 --> 00:43:21,285
I mean, I, I would try
and help you find it.

726
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:22,553
I just gotta.
- Yeah no.

727
00:43:22,586 --> 00:43:24,721
Don't worry about, I got it.

00:43:53,684 --> 00:43:55,552
<i>Billy's not a criminal.</i>

730
00:43:55,586 --> 00:43:57,721
<i>He's the best friend
we have on this boat.</i>

731
00:43:57,754 --> 00:43:59,365
[Man] <i>We're not in</i>
<i>need of such friends.</i>

732
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:00,357
<i>You need any
friends you can get.</i>

733
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:01,758
<i>The only thing
standing between you</i>

734
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:04,695
<i>and a watery grave is your wits.</i>

735
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:07,197
<i>That's not my idea of
adequate protection.</i>

736
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,433
<i>Purser, how much longer
before this ship reaches port?</i>

737
00:44:09,466 --> 00:44:10,510
[Man] <i>If we ever do get to port</i>

738
00:44:10,534 --> 00:44:13,337
<i>it should be within
14 or 15 hours.</i>

739
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,238
[Man] <i>That's a long time.</i>

740
00:44:15,272 --> 00:44:16,482
<i>Sit down, make
yourself comfortable.</i>

741
00:44:16,506 --> 00:44:17,674
<i>Have a drink.</i>

742
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:19,643
<i>Enjoy the Major's piano recital.</i>

743
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:21,578
<i>Come on, Peterson.</i>

744
00:44:21,612 --> 00:44:22,779
<i>Buy us a drink.</i>

745
00:44:22,813 --> 00:44:24,024
[Peterson] <i>I'm afraid I</i>
<i>can't accept hospitality</i>

746
00:44:24,048 --> 00:44:26,316
<i>from persons who I intend

747
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:27,317
<i>to denounce.</i>

748
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:29,486
(pensive music)

749
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:40,397
(phone vibrates)

750
00:44:57,814 --> 00:44:58,814
Hello?

751
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:01,617
Hi.

752
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,221
How are you?

753
00:45:25,308 --> 00:45:27,844
(rain pattering)

754
00:45:34,885 --> 00:45:35,885
- Hi.
- Hi.

755
00:45:39,957 --> 00:45:41,191
Hi.

756
00:45:41,993 --> 00:45:43,727
What's wrong?

757
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,629
- Nothing.
- Of course it's something.

758
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:46,662
You're upset.

759
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:49,199
Oh no, it's nothing.

760
00:45:51,468 --> 00:45:53,937
My husband called me
on the way over here,

761
00:45:53,971 --> 00:45:56,640
caught me off guard and
started yelling at me.

762
00:45:56,673 --> 00:45:59,209
And we started to arguing about
nothing like we always do.

763
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:01,678
I fucking hate this guy.

764
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:03,679
I'm sorry.

765
00:46:05,515 --> 00:46:06,515
Don't worry.

766
00:46:08,986 --> 00:46:10,854
I'm so happy you're here.

767
00:46:12,823 --> 00:46:13,823
Me too.

768
00:46:14,891 --> 00:46:16,994
(romantic music)

769
00:46:17,028 --> 00:46:17,894
We should go.

770
00:46:17,928 --> 00:46:19,629
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

771
00:46:27,938 --> 00:46:30,774
(Marilyn moaning)

772
00:47:19,456 --> 00:47:22,026
(both moaning)

773
00:48:21,785 --> 00:48:22,785
Hmm.

774
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:27,058
At least this can be ours.

775
00:48:28,725 --> 00:48:29,725
Yeah. How's that?

776
00:48:31,561 --> 00:48:33,998
My husband rarely
comes here these days.

777
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:41,471
Once he owns something,
cars, women, houses,

778
00:48:41,504 --> 00:48:43,506
he tends to lose interest.

779
00:48:45,675 --> 00:48:48,012
He leaves this to me
as my little getaway.

780
00:48:52,116 --> 00:48:53,116
You don't like it?

781
00:48:54,484 --> 00:48:55,785
I don't like this.

782
00:49:03,194 --> 00:49:05,795
I think about us, you,

783
00:49:07,164 --> 00:49:11,035
your body, inside of me
every second of the day.

784
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:15,939
And I think how's
this even possible.

785
00:49:18,109 --> 00:49:20,410
How can I want him so much?

786
00:49:23,114 --> 00:49:24,114
I feel the same.

787
00:49:29,186 --> 00:49:30,186
And yet...

788
00:49:31,155 --> 00:49:32,189
Exactly.

789
00:49:34,058 --> 00:49:35,425
Maybe he'll leave me.

790
00:49:37,928 --> 00:49:40,164
And until then, he'll
just keep hitting people,

791
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:43,200
abusing them?

792
00:49:49,906 --> 00:49:50,906
Maybe he'll die.

793
00:49:52,943 --> 00:49:53,943
Doubt it.

794
00:49:55,246 --> 00:49:57,914
Everyone in that man's
family lives past 90.

795
00:49:57,948 --> 00:49:59,250
Trust me, I checked.

796
00:49:59,283 --> 00:50:00,784
People die all the time.

797
00:50:02,019 --> 00:50:03,019
That's true.

798
00:50:04,921 --> 00:50:08,591
Car accidents,
falling down the stairs.

799
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:11,228
All kinds of shit.

800
00:50:15,665 --> 00:50:17,534
I'm just saying it happens.

801
00:50:21,771 --> 00:50:24,175
Do you think it's fate
that we met, you and I?

802
00:50:25,242 --> 00:50:26,978
I do.

803
00:50:27,011 --> 00:50:28,545
I really do think so.

804
00:50:30,214 --> 00:50:31,214
I do too.

805
00:50:32,649 --> 00:50:34,986
I've been waiting for
this my whole life.

806
00:50:38,788 --> 00:50:43,593
My god, you have
such a beautiful face.

807
00:50:46,796 --> 00:50:48,598
I'm glad you like it.

808
00:50:49,899 --> 00:50:52,236
(gentle music)

809
00:51:02,712 --> 00:51:03,847
I don't mean to rush you.

810
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,282
Yeah, I get it.

811
00:51:11,688 --> 00:51:13,157
- We got everything?
- Yeah.

812
00:51:19,596 --> 00:51:21,165
I really gotta get
that thing fixed.

813
00:51:21,198 --> 00:51:23,300
You sure you had
it when we got here?

814
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:26,270
I think so, but then again,

815
00:51:26,303 --> 00:51:28,973
I did take off all my clothes
and go in the shower with you.

816
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:31,175
So, I don't really know.

817
00:51:33,077 --> 00:51:35,312
It's probably at my house,
I think so.

818
00:51:35,945 --> 00:51:38,149
And if it's here,
you'll just let me know.

819
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:41,185
Okay. Thank you for
your understanding.

820
00:51:41,218 --> 00:51:42,319
Didn't say I understood.

821
00:51:47,224 --> 00:51:48,825
See you soon?

822
00:51:48,858 --> 00:51:49,858
Maybe.

823
00:51:53,364 --> 00:51:55,266
Why does that
sound like goodbye?

824
00:52:00,271 --> 00:52:01,271
What?

825
00:52:02,672 --> 00:52:03,740
Tell me.

826
00:52:04,341 --> 00:52:05,976
Because it could be, Connor.

827
00:52:07,844 --> 00:52:09,313
Are you joking?

828
00:52:09,346 --> 00:52:10,580
Are you joking?

829
00:52:12,183 --> 00:52:13,184
Marilyn?

830
00:52:13,217 --> 00:52:15,752
That's crazy. I mean,
after what we just did,

831
00:52:15,785 --> 00:52:17,754
that's not normal.
- But that's just it.

832
00:52:17,787 --> 00:52:21,258
It was incredible
and you're incredible.

833
00:52:23,394 --> 00:52:25,229
But people don't
just die or go away.

834
00:52:26,696 --> 00:52:28,265
So I can't promise.

835
00:52:28,299 --> 00:52:30,334
Marilyn. No!

836
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:34,038
No, that just, it like,
it can't, I don't,

837
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:37,807
I don't understand,
like please, Marilyn.

838
00:52:37,841 --> 00:52:39,276
Fuck! No.
- I hope

839
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:41,778
this is not the end for us.

840
00:52:41,811 --> 00:52:42,811
I really do.

841
00:52:45,748 --> 00:52:46,748
But it could be.

842
00:52:52,123 --> 00:52:54,158
(ship's horn blasts)

843
00:52:54,191 --> 00:52:55,191
You should go.

844
00:53:26,357 --> 00:53:28,058
While you were
inside getting lunch,

845
00:53:28,092 --> 00:53:31,262
my buddy, Walt, he's the best
guy, he sent me this meme.

846
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:33,430
Look at it. It's hilarious.

847
00:53:33,464 --> 00:53:35,032
Yeah. It's pretty funny.

848
00:53:35,065 --> 00:53:36,065
Hi there.

849
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:39,136
[Connor] Hello again.

850
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:40,170
Hi.

851
00:53:46,876 --> 00:53:48,445
So how did your paper go?

852
00:53:48,479 --> 00:53:50,447
Oh, it was fine.

853
00:53:50,481 --> 00:53:52,183
I gotta B+.

854
00:53:52,216 --> 00:53:53,417
So that was pretty okay.

855
00:53:54,351 --> 00:53:55,718
Good.

856
00:53:55,752 --> 00:53:58,422
Well, glad we had
something useful for you.

857
00:54:01,492 --> 00:54:02,492
Hey, Kim.

858
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,160
Hi.

859
00:54:06,363 --> 00:54:08,332
Connor, I think we
should probably go.

860
00:54:08,365 --> 00:54:10,034
Yeah. Probably.

861
00:54:10,067 --> 00:54:11,168
Actually, I'm sorry,

862
00:54:12,436 --> 00:54:15,005
I did have a question
for you, book question.

863
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,441
Okay.

864
00:54:17,474 --> 00:54:18,475
I mean I can go and...

865
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:20,444
No, no, that's totally fine.

866
00:54:20,477 --> 00:54:21,378
It's totally fine.
- Oh.

867
00:54:21,412 --> 00:54:23,480
Um yeah.

868
00:54:23,514 --> 00:54:25,382
You know, why don't
you cover for me now

869
00:54:25,416 --> 00:54:28,385
and I'll take the
second shift and yeah,

870
00:54:28,419 --> 00:54:30,187
I'll figure it out
the rest of my break.

871
00:54:30,221 --> 00:54:32,957
So would that be okay?
- Oh.

872
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:34,757
Sure.

873
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:35,960
- Great.
- Sounds good.

874
00:54:37,394 --> 00:54:38,761
Have a nice day.

875
00:54:38,795 --> 00:54:39,896
- You too.
- Bye Kim.

876
00:54:42,466 --> 00:54:43,766
[Connor] Thanks Kim.

877
00:54:46,003 --> 00:54:48,771
- What's up man?
- Nothing.

878
00:54:48,805 --> 00:54:49,806
What's up with you?

879
00:54:50,975 --> 00:54:52,509
Doing pretty good.
Don't you think?

880
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:53,786
Hanging out with these
beautiful ladies.

881
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:56,113
So life doesn't completely suck.

882
00:54:56,146 --> 00:54:58,115
Wait, do you guys
know each other?

883
00:54:58,148 --> 00:54:59,350
Oh yeah.

884
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:02,386
Everybody from Twin Oaks
knows Connor. (laughs)

885
00:55:02,419 --> 00:55:04,431
Well, you're pretty famous
around here yourself, Jared.

886
00:55:04,455 --> 00:55:06,457
Ah, not like you.

887
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:09,059
This guy made a real
name for himself.

888
00:55:09,093 --> 00:55:11,028
Huh? Interesting.

889
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:12,061
Not really.

890
00:55:13,163 --> 00:55:15,399
Anyways, you had a
question about a book.

891
00:55:15,432 --> 00:55:17,234
That's the guy I told you about.

892
00:55:17,268 --> 00:55:18,969
Yes, the one that
you recommended,

893
00:55:19,003 --> 00:55:20,803
about the two lovers.

894
00:55:23,474 --> 00:55:24,941
Both of the books
that you borrowed

895
00:55:24,975 --> 00:55:25,975
have two lovers in them.

896
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:30,047
Yeah, well the one that
you said was so good,

897
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,283
<i>The Postman Always Rings Twice.</i>

898
00:55:32,316 --> 00:55:33,350
Okay.

899
00:55:33,384 --> 00:55:34,394
I haven't had a
chance to read it.

900
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:36,919
I was just wondering,
do they get away with it?

901
00:55:38,122 --> 00:55:40,790
Do you mean at the
end or the crime itself?

902
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:42,859
The crime.

903
00:55:42,892 --> 00:55:43,892
Yeah they do.

904
00:55:45,596 --> 00:55:46,563
Oh.

905
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:48,198
So it's a happy ending then?

906
00:55:50,401 --> 00:55:51,402
Not necessarily.

907
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:54,937
But the husband, he...

908
00:55:54,972 --> 00:55:56,440
Yeah, he dies.

909
00:56:28,138 --> 00:56:30,907
(phone vibrates)

910
00:56:44,555 --> 00:56:45,589
Hello?

911
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:48,425
That was torture today.

912
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:51,894
Yeah. I agree.

913
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,035
Did you ever find your keys?

914
00:57:00,537 --> 00:57:01,638
No, it's not my keys.

915
00:57:01,672 --> 00:57:05,908
It's the little part that
connects to the end, but no,

916
00:57:05,942 --> 00:57:08,178
it'll turn up, it always does.

917
00:57:08,212 --> 00:57:09,613
Mm. I hope so.

918
00:57:11,281 --> 00:57:12,649
You said it was a keepsake.

919
00:57:14,218 --> 00:57:17,454
(ship's horn blasts)

920
00:57:17,488 --> 00:57:20,624
Are you, are you okay?

921
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:28,098
Has something else happened?

922
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:33,703
That means yes.

923
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,608
Fucking piece of shit.

924
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:47,351
It could have been
a happy ending.

925
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:49,620
I'm sorry. You mean us?

926
00:57:52,122 --> 00:57:55,159
What you asked me
about today in the book?

927
00:57:56,994 --> 00:57:59,530
Would a turned out just fine
if they stuck together,

928
00:58:00,597 --> 00:58:01,597
but they didn't.

929
00:58:02,533 --> 00:58:04,568
They turned on each other
and fucked everything up.

930
00:58:05,669 --> 00:58:08,038
<i>Everything would've been fine
if they just saw it through.</i>

931
00:58:12,743 --> 00:58:14,478
What are you saying to me?

932
00:58:14,511 --> 00:58:16,447
You know what I'm saying to you.

933
00:58:17,347 --> 00:58:19,149
Tell me, say it.

934
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:23,320
That...

935
00:58:25,656 --> 00:58:27,024
if we do this,

936
00:58:29,326 --> 00:58:30,394
then it's forever.

937
00:58:32,296 --> 00:58:34,665
And I mean for all times,
does that make sense?

938
00:58:35,466 --> 00:58:36,466
Yes.

939
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:39,268
And?

940
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:42,639
I agree.

941
00:58:45,209 --> 00:58:46,310
<i>It's forever.</i>

942
00:58:48,812 --> 00:58:49,980
Okay.

943
00:58:51,615 --> 00:58:52,616
Alright, good.

944
00:58:57,054 --> 00:58:58,689
I'd do anything to be with you.

945
00:59:02,359 --> 00:59:03,360
So will I.

946
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:08,298
I'll be at the cottage tomorrow.

947
00:59:11,268 --> 00:59:13,670
(phone clicks)

948
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:28,785
I'm taking Astrid to Boston
next week for two days,

949
00:59:29,653 --> 00:59:32,523
shopping trip he
promised us months ago.

950
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:35,325
[Connor] Interesting.

951
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:38,462
Well, if he keeps his word,

952
00:59:39,763 --> 00:59:42,399
which is not always
his strong suit.

953
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,768
That happens often?

954
00:59:46,203 --> 00:59:48,238
More often than I'd like.

955
00:59:48,272 --> 00:59:49,273
Which means a lot.

956
00:59:54,444 --> 00:59:57,414
If this does happen,
where will he be?

957
00:59:58,715 --> 01:00:00,384
At the house.

958
01:00:00,417 --> 01:00:01,685
Which one?

959
01:00:01,718 --> 01:00:04,254
(scoffs) True.

960
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:06,423
Out on the point.

961
01:00:08,659 --> 01:00:09,659
Any alarms?

962
01:00:10,627 --> 01:00:13,397
Nuh uh, no alarms.
He doesn't believe in them.

963
01:00:14,831 --> 01:00:17,734
He sleeps with a gun under
his pillow, wherever he goes.

964
01:00:17,768 --> 01:00:19,269
Makes him feel like a big man.

965
01:00:20,671 --> 01:00:21,671
Got it.

966
01:00:33,884 --> 01:00:35,419
Is this really happening?

967
01:00:37,621 --> 01:00:42,593
Unless you told me to stop
it this instant, then yes,

968
01:00:42,626 --> 01:00:43,794
it's going to happen.

969
01:00:50,801 --> 01:00:52,336
Tell me it isn't for the money.

970
01:00:55,372 --> 01:00:56,372
His money.

971
01:00:58,809 --> 01:01:01,244
If it is, even partially for it,

972
01:01:03,547 --> 01:01:04,881
lie to me and tell me it isn't.

973
01:01:04,915 --> 01:01:06,450
Of course it isn't.

974
01:01:06,483 --> 01:01:08,785
You don't even have
to think about it?

975
01:01:08,819 --> 01:01:11,188
- No!
- Not even for a second?

976
01:01:11,221 --> 01:01:13,190
It seems like he's
got a lot of it.

977
01:01:13,223 --> 01:01:15,626
He does millions and
millions, but not for me.

978
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:20,230
I, I don't understand.

979
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:23,500
Well, I mean, some
of it will come to me

980
01:01:23,533 --> 01:01:26,503
as a monthly stipend,
but you know,

981
01:01:26,536 --> 01:01:28,305
the bulk of his
estate goes to Astrid.

982
01:01:28,338 --> 01:01:31,308
I'm just the executor
until she turns 25 and,

983
01:01:31,341 --> 01:01:32,341
then it's all hers.

984
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:40,350
Did I say something wrong?

985
01:01:42,886 --> 01:01:44,221
Are you having second thoughts?

986
01:01:44,254 --> 01:01:46,923
About you? Never.

987
01:01:51,495 --> 01:01:52,863
I'm doing this for us

988
01:01:52,896 --> 01:01:54,207
and I'm not gonna
think twice about it.

989
01:01:54,231 --> 01:01:55,799
(ominous tones)

990
01:01:55,832 --> 01:01:58,635
I don't want to know
anymore about him ever.

991
01:01:58,669 --> 01:01:59,669
Never again.

992
01:02:00,737 --> 01:02:03,273
What I know is the way
he treats you and her.

993
01:02:05,442 --> 01:02:06,677
And that's enough for me.

994
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:10,847
Yes. It's gonna happen
while you're in Boston.

995
01:02:12,916 --> 01:02:16,319
And when it does, we'll be free.

996
01:02:25,295 --> 01:02:27,831
(romantic music)

997
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,896
(rain pattering)

998
01:03:05,036 --> 01:03:06,236
I should go.

999
01:03:08,672 --> 01:03:09,974
I don't want you to.

1000
01:03:10,807 --> 01:03:12,743
Soon I won't have to.

1001
01:03:24,921 --> 01:03:26,656
We shouldn't talk for a while.

1002
01:03:29,326 --> 01:03:32,964
I don't know for how long, but
until we both know it's safe.

1003
01:03:34,331 --> 01:03:35,331
I understand.

1004
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,568
If anybody ever asks you,

1005
01:03:38,602 --> 01:03:41,905
any phone call we ever
had is about work.

1006
01:03:44,441 --> 01:03:46,786
I gave you my numbers so that
you could ask me about authors

1007
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:49,379
or I could provide
you with information.

1008
01:03:49,412 --> 01:03:51,015
Yes, I'll do that.

1009
01:03:54,085 --> 01:03:55,085
Good.

1010
01:04:01,758 --> 01:04:04,761
There's a sun room of
the side of the house,

1011
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:07,330
the door doesn't lock.

1012
01:04:12,103 --> 01:04:14,071
We're supposed to
leave on Tuesday.

1013
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,642
Then have a nice trip.

1014
01:04:22,046 --> 01:04:24,115
There's one more thing
I need you to do.

1015
01:04:24,148 --> 01:04:25,983
I need you to go
to a drug store.

1016
01:04:26,017 --> 01:04:28,752
And I need you to buy one
of those burner phones.

1017
01:04:28,785 --> 01:04:31,488
If anything happens while
I'm gone, you can text me.

1018
01:04:32,556 --> 01:04:33,991
That way I'll know
you're in trouble

1019
01:04:34,025 --> 01:04:35,325
or you need something.

1020
01:04:36,493 --> 01:04:38,762
When you use it,
text me one word,

1021
01:04:38,795 --> 01:04:41,731
text me the word
books and I'll know.

1022
01:04:41,765 --> 01:04:44,534
And I'll get to you
somehow, I promise you.

1023
01:04:44,568 --> 01:04:47,470
But do not call me, text me.

1024
01:04:47,504 --> 01:04:48,815
And I will meet you
at the parking lot

1025
01:04:48,839 --> 01:04:50,874
of the woods where we met, okay?

1026
01:04:50,907 --> 01:04:52,310
[Marilyn] Okay.

1027
01:04:53,877 --> 01:04:56,513
You do that and I promise you,

1028
01:04:57,848 --> 01:05:01,518
I will get to you no
matter what it takes, okay?

1029
01:05:02,519 --> 01:05:03,887
At least we'll be together.

1030
01:05:05,089 --> 01:05:06,089
Do you understand?

1031
01:05:07,124 --> 01:05:07,992
Nothing's gonna happen, alright?

1032
01:05:08,025 --> 01:05:09,093
Don't say it.

1033
01:05:10,493 --> 01:05:11,493
You'll jinx it.

1034
01:05:13,998 --> 01:05:16,067
Will you promise
we'll be together?

1035
01:05:17,001 --> 01:05:18,002
I promise.

1036
01:05:19,669 --> 01:05:22,606
(unsettling music)

1037
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:27,871
Hello there.

1038
01:06:27,904 --> 01:06:28,904
What's up?

1039
01:06:32,176 --> 01:06:33,843
That'd be my next question.

1040
01:06:34,811 --> 01:06:35,811
Isn't that weird.

1041
01:06:37,248 --> 01:06:38,481
Where you been all day?

1042
01:06:41,718 --> 01:06:44,021
Good to see you too, Deputy.

1043
01:06:44,055 --> 01:06:45,689
You don't wanna
get smart right now.

1044
01:06:45,722 --> 01:06:47,224
Smart asses get
read their rights

1045
01:06:47,258 --> 01:06:49,226
while I hold their
stupid fucking faces down

1046
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:50,593
against the hood of my car.

1047
01:06:52,629 --> 01:06:54,564
Do you see the way
this guy talks to me?

1048
01:06:54,597 --> 01:06:55,677
Just answer the question.

1049
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,136
I was out. It's my day off.

1050
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:00,770
Out? Where?

1051
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,240
Running.

1052
01:07:05,076 --> 01:07:07,811
Running? All day long?

1053
01:07:07,844 --> 01:07:11,514
Yeah. And whatever.

1054
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:14,151
What is this?

1055
01:07:14,185 --> 01:07:16,220
Eh, maybe something,
maybe nothing.

1056
01:07:16,253 --> 01:07:19,190
We've had a series of
break-ins the last few weeks.

1057
01:07:19,223 --> 01:07:21,225
Last night we had three.

1058
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:25,196
And you're asking me because?

1059
01:07:25,229 --> 01:07:28,565
Because you're a
convict and you live here.

1060
01:07:28,598 --> 01:07:31,202
We're talking to anybody
with a record, so...

1061
01:07:31,235 --> 01:07:32,136
I see.

1062
01:07:32,169 --> 01:07:34,205
[Deputy] I bet you do.

1063
01:07:34,238 --> 01:07:36,207
Take it easy, please.

1064
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,817
He's got no priors when
it comes to stealing

1065
01:07:37,841 --> 01:07:38,641
or breaking and entering.

1066
01:07:38,675 --> 01:07:40,111
He's been to prison.

1067
01:07:40,144 --> 01:07:41,254
Yeah. So has Martha Stewart.

1068
01:07:41,278 --> 01:07:42,579
You check on her
whereabouts yet?

1069
01:07:42,612 --> 01:07:43,713
You piece of shit!

1070
01:07:44,581 --> 01:07:46,217
Come on. Relax.

1071
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:49,020
Okay. You got nothing, right?

1072
01:07:49,053 --> 01:07:51,288
Because you have an
alibi for last night.

1073
01:07:51,322 --> 01:07:52,322
Don't you?

1074
01:07:54,758 --> 01:07:55,758
Yeah.

1075
01:07:56,593 --> 01:07:57,593
What is it?

1076
01:08:00,264 --> 01:08:04,201
Dinner, with my mom,

1077
01:08:07,238 --> 01:08:08,238
until late.

1078
01:08:09,073 --> 01:08:10,241
What is going on?

1079
01:08:10,274 --> 01:08:11,274
How late?

1080
01:08:12,276 --> 01:08:14,111
One or two.

1081
01:08:14,145 --> 01:08:18,581
We watched some movie on TCM.
<i>The Lady From Shanghai</i>.

1082
01:08:18,615 --> 01:08:19,916
Where is she?

1083
01:08:19,949 --> 01:08:21,918
In Shanghai I presume.

1084
01:08:21,951 --> 01:08:23,187
Fuck you. Your mom.

1085
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:24,220
Oh, my mother.

1086
01:08:25,289 --> 01:08:28,059
At work, at the hospital.

1087
01:08:29,126 --> 01:08:30,126
Call her.

1088
01:08:31,062 --> 01:08:32,896
Why didn't you
answer my calls today?

1089
01:08:34,265 --> 01:08:35,199
When?

1090
01:08:35,232 --> 01:08:36,300
Oh, check your phone.

1091
01:08:37,234 --> 01:08:38,269
Check your phone.

1092
01:08:42,373 --> 01:08:43,373
Six.

1093
01:08:44,308 --> 01:08:45,142
It's off.

1094
01:08:45,176 --> 01:08:47,278
Oh, keep that
shit on from now on.

1095
01:08:47,311 --> 01:08:48,979
Do you hear me?

1096
01:08:49,013 --> 01:08:51,015
I don't like driving here
anymore than I have to.

1097
01:08:51,048 --> 01:08:53,284
Whether it's bullshit or not.

1098
01:08:53,317 --> 01:08:54,251
God, I keep giving you chances.

1099
01:08:54,285 --> 01:08:55,685
You keep dicking 'em up.

1100
01:08:57,088 --> 01:08:58,088
I'm sorry.

1101
01:08:59,789 --> 01:09:01,292
Okay. We should go.

1102
01:09:01,325 --> 01:09:02,325
Can we go?

1103
01:09:03,726 --> 01:09:05,795
I'll see you soon for
breakfast. Don't be late.

1104
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:15,239
(engine cranks)

1105
01:09:23,214 --> 01:09:25,116
Anyway, blah, blah, blah.

1106
01:09:25,149 --> 01:09:26,016
Enough about me.

1107
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:27,151
No, I'm interested.

1108
01:09:29,253 --> 01:09:32,957
(laughs) No, you're not.

1109
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:34,992
I wish you were, but you're not.

1110
01:09:35,025 --> 01:09:38,028
You keep looking around,
checking your phone.

1111
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:41,432
It's like your
mind's not even here.

1112
01:09:41,465 --> 01:09:43,200
That's not true.

1113
01:09:43,234 --> 01:09:44,234
Isn't it though?

1114
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:47,338
I mean, yeah.

1115
01:09:47,371 --> 01:09:51,175
I'm a little distracted,
but I'm interested.

1116
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:54,777
But not actually like I am.

1117
01:09:56,447 --> 01:09:57,847
What do you mean, Kim?

1118
01:09:59,316 --> 01:10:02,019
Like I am in you.

1119
01:10:05,456 --> 01:10:06,456
Oh.

1120
01:10:08,225 --> 01:10:10,660
Right. Oh.

1121
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:14,931
Anyway. Change of subject.

1122
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:17,300
Why tonight?

1123
01:10:18,302 --> 01:10:19,069
I've asked you out
a couple of times,

1124
01:10:19,103 --> 01:10:22,006
well, not out out,
but for a run.

1125
01:10:22,039 --> 01:10:23,039
Whatever.

1126
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:25,376
Why now?

1127
01:10:25,409 --> 01:10:26,409
Why dinner?

1128
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:28,810
No reason.

1129
01:10:29,879 --> 01:10:34,084
Just, and we don't have
to do that, by the way.

1130
01:10:34,118 --> 01:10:36,153
You know, change the subject.

1131
01:10:37,388 --> 01:10:41,925
I just, I didn't know that
you felt that way about me.

1132
01:10:43,394 --> 01:10:46,030
You know, I thought we were
just friends or something.

1133
01:10:47,231 --> 01:10:50,167
We are, but Connor, come on.

1134
01:10:52,469 --> 01:10:54,804
You know what I'm talking
about, I know you do.

1135
01:10:59,243 --> 01:11:00,243
Kim.

1136
01:11:06,317 --> 01:11:08,219
Look, I love being
friends with you.

1137
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:10,787
I need friends.

1138
01:11:11,888 --> 01:11:13,324
Seriously.

1139
01:11:13,357 --> 01:11:16,293
I think you're amazing, but-

1140
01:11:16,327 --> 01:11:17,428
- No.
- I just.

1141
01:11:18,529 --> 01:11:19,529
I get it.

1142
01:11:21,565 --> 01:11:22,565
Yeah.

1143
01:11:28,805 --> 01:11:31,908
Would you excuse
me for one minute?

1144
01:12:01,472 --> 01:12:04,408
(suspenseful music)

1145
01:12:59,196 --> 01:13:01,498
(floor creaks)

1146
01:13:07,404 --> 01:13:09,973
(floor creaks)

1147
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:28,891
(stair creaks)

1148
01:13:45,342 --> 01:13:46,643
[Intruder] Whoa.

1149
01:13:51,582 --> 01:13:52,582
Oh my god.

1150
01:14:08,632 --> 01:14:09,632
Dammit.

1151
01:15:17,234 --> 01:15:19,736
(door closes)

1152
01:15:25,809 --> 01:15:30,414
(laughs) You look
such a little...

1153
01:15:32,449 --> 01:15:35,352
No, I couldn't sleep.

1154
01:15:35,385 --> 01:15:37,721
So I walked down to the marina.

1155
01:15:40,057 --> 01:15:42,259
(sighs) Okay, yes.

1156
01:15:42,626 --> 01:15:45,262
The bar down by the marina.

1157
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:50,667
What?

1158
01:15:51,668 --> 01:15:54,104
No, I keep ours on the Cape.

1159
01:15:54,137 --> 01:15:56,139
Come on. You know that.

1160
01:15:56,173 --> 01:15:57,574
No, I just...

1161
01:16:01,378 --> 01:16:03,614
Yes. A couple of drinks.

1162
01:16:04,781 --> 01:16:06,283
And now I'm back.

1163
01:16:06,316 --> 01:16:09,686
So tell Daddy goodnight
and go to sleep.

1164
01:16:13,557 --> 01:16:14,557
Yes.

1165
01:16:16,727 --> 01:16:17,727
I said yes.

1166
01:16:19,596 --> 01:16:20,596
It's true.

1167
01:16:22,199 --> 01:16:23,534
I'll see you soon.

1168
01:16:25,736 --> 01:16:29,306
Yes. (laughs)

1169
01:16:29,339 --> 01:16:30,507
Good night.

1170
01:16:32,609 --> 01:16:35,178
(floor creaks)

1171
01:16:47,858 --> 01:16:50,561
(tense music)

1172
01:16:58,435 --> 01:17:00,804
(men grunting)

1173
01:17:13,617 --> 01:17:15,319
(gun clicks)

1174
01:17:15,352 --> 01:17:17,821
(Connor grunts)

1175
01:17:22,693 --> 01:17:25,762
You are dead, mother fucker.

1176
01:17:25,796 --> 01:17:27,130
(gun clicks)

1177
01:17:27,164 --> 01:17:30,534
So I hope to God
that it was worth it.

1178
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:35,572
(thudding)
(husband grunts)

1179
01:17:36,607 --> 01:17:39,610
(suspenseful music)

1180
01:17:45,382 --> 01:17:46,783
[Connor] Sit the fuck down.

1181
01:17:46,817 --> 01:17:47,718
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Sit the fuck down.

1182
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:48,652
Wait, wait, dude, it's me.

1183
01:17:48,685 --> 01:17:50,253
It's me, it's me, it's Jared.

1184
01:17:50,287 --> 01:17:51,722
Jared!

1185
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:53,724
What the fuck are
you doing here?

1186
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:54,658
Same thing as you, man.

1187
01:17:54,691 --> 01:17:55,759
What do you think?

1188
01:17:55,792 --> 01:17:56,860
Tell me.

1189
01:17:56,893 --> 01:17:58,771
Dude, I'm fucking breaking
in and stealing shit.

1190
01:17:58,795 --> 01:18:00,397
Bro, don't point
that thing at me.

1191
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:02,466
Who told you to do that?

1192
01:18:02,499 --> 01:18:04,167
Your little fucking girlfriend?

1193
01:18:04,201 --> 01:18:05,268
No, no dude.

1194
01:18:05,302 --> 01:18:06,269
I mean, she hates her old man

1195
01:18:06,303 --> 01:18:07,480
and she showed me all
the shit that he owns.

1196
01:18:07,504 --> 01:18:09,873
But dude, I've been doing this
all over the fucking town.

1197
01:18:09,906 --> 01:18:11,575
I can't help it. It's what I do.

1198
01:18:11,608 --> 01:18:14,911
That's not what I
fucking asked you.

1199
01:18:14,945 --> 01:18:16,413
That is not what I asked you.

1200
01:18:17,581 --> 01:18:18,791
Okay, I was, I
was, I was up here

1201
01:18:18,815 --> 01:18:21,718
and I heard someone come
in, so I fucking hid.

1202
01:18:21,752 --> 01:18:22,686
And then I heard
you two fighting.

1203
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,588
So I came in here and he was...

1204
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:26,289
Bro, he was about to
shoot, I saved you.

1205
01:18:26,323 --> 01:18:28,925
Can you not point that
thing at me please?

1206
01:18:34,564 --> 01:18:36,400
(gunfire pops)

1207
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:45,375
(gunfire pops)
(Connor pants)

1208
01:18:48,545 --> 01:18:49,545
Fuck.

1209
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:01,490
Oh fuck.

1210
01:19:04,861 --> 01:19:05,861
Okay, okay.

1211
01:19:07,798 --> 01:19:08,832
Take this shit.

1212
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:11,868
Where the fuck is my mask?

1213
01:19:11,902 --> 01:19:12,902
I'm okay.

1214
01:19:17,941 --> 01:19:18,941
Okay.

1215
01:19:23,814 --> 01:19:24,915
Oh fuck.

1216
01:19:24,948 --> 01:19:25,983
Where's my fucking mask.

1217
01:19:26,017 --> 01:19:26,883
Shit.

1218
01:19:26,917 --> 01:19:28,385
Where the fuck?

1219
01:19:35,926 --> 01:19:37,627
Oh fuck.

1220
01:19:43,734 --> 01:19:44,734
Shit.

1221
01:19:47,938 --> 01:19:50,340
(glass shatters)

1222
01:19:50,373 --> 01:19:51,373
Fuck!

1223
01:19:58,648 --> 01:19:59,984
Fuck!

1224
01:20:00,017 --> 01:20:00,817
(glass shatters)

1225
01:20:00,851 --> 01:20:01,851
Fuck!

1226
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:16,266
(glass shatters)

1227
01:20:20,037 --> 01:20:21,738
(door slams)

1228
01:20:23,673 --> 01:20:25,575
(unsettling music)

1229
01:20:25,609 --> 01:20:27,310
<i>Yes, the roadblocks are up.</i>

1230
01:20:29,046 --> 01:20:30,014
<i>We're watching
the railroad station</i>

1231
01:20:30,047 --> 01:20:32,582
<i>and he isn't hiding
in the woods.</i>

1232
01:20:42,559 --> 01:20:45,062
(phone vibrates)

1233
01:20:59,476 --> 01:21:00,476
[Marilyn] <i>Hello?</i>

1234
01:21:02,013 --> 01:21:03,047
<i>Connor?</i>

1235
01:21:05,415 --> 01:21:06,950
Connor. You there?

1236
01:21:07,851 --> 01:21:09,553
(ominous tones)

1237
01:21:09,586 --> 01:21:11,088
What did I say about calling me?

1238
01:21:13,024 --> 01:21:14,524
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1239
01:21:15,126 --> 01:21:19,863
You don't have to
apologize, but what did I say?

1240
01:21:20,998 --> 01:21:21,966
Not to.

1241
01:21:21,999 --> 01:21:23,034
<i>That's right.</i>

1242
01:21:24,701 --> 01:21:26,037
And now you did.

1243
01:21:28,139 --> 01:21:30,640
<i>I'm on the phone
that you made me get.</i>

1244
01:21:30,674 --> 01:21:31,842
It's not what I said.

1245
01:21:33,643 --> 01:21:34,778
It's not what I said.

1246
01:21:34,811 --> 01:21:37,581
<i>I said, don't call me
on this phone period.</i>

1247
01:21:38,515 --> 01:21:39,850
And now you did.

1248
01:21:41,484 --> 01:21:42,819
<i>You know why I said that.</i>

1249
01:21:42,853 --> 01:21:44,021
Because it's dangerous.

1250
01:21:44,055 --> 01:21:45,957
<i>More than that because
it's the type of thing</i>

1251
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:47,557
<i>that you can get you caught.</i>

1252
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,461
Well, you've done it now anyway.

1253
01:21:51,494 --> 01:21:52,494
So go ahead.

1254
01:21:56,167 --> 01:21:58,535
He's dead by the way, if
that's what you're wondering.

1255
01:22:01,105 --> 01:22:02,539
Is it?

1256
01:22:02,572 --> 01:22:03,874
- No.
<i>- Really?</i>

1257
01:22:05,442 --> 01:22:08,745
I, I just wanted to,

1258
01:22:08,778 --> 01:22:10,513
I needed to know
that you're okay,

1259
01:22:10,547 --> 01:22:11,648
that you're alive.

1260
01:22:15,019 --> 01:22:16,053
Okay.

1261
01:22:16,087 --> 01:22:17,487
Well, why wouldn't I be?

1262
01:22:19,156 --> 01:22:20,857
I don't know.

1263
01:22:20,891 --> 01:22:25,695
I just, you're just really
horrible to me right now.

1264
01:22:26,496 --> 01:22:27,631
Maybe that's because

1265
01:22:27,664 --> 01:22:29,166
I just killed somebody
four hours ago.

1266
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,002
Maybe that's why, I don't know.

1267
01:22:37,108 --> 01:22:40,077
<i>He'll be found soon if
he hasn't been already.</i>

1268
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:44,547
Nobody's contacted you yet?

1269
01:22:46,083 --> 01:22:47,118
No.

1270
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:50,920
All right.

1271
01:22:52,089 --> 01:22:53,090
Then there's still time.

1272
01:22:54,491 --> 01:22:55,993
Before what?

1273
01:22:56,027 --> 01:22:57,870
Before the world comes
busting down on our heads

1274
01:22:57,894 --> 01:22:59,562
at 10,000 miles
per hour, Marilyn.

1275
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:14,810
Why was he there?

1276
01:23:16,213 --> 01:23:18,949
Because I told you
that he'd be there.

1277
01:23:18,983 --> 01:23:20,084
It's his house.

1278
01:23:21,851 --> 01:23:23,887
Not talking about your husband.

1279
01:23:25,289 --> 01:23:28,658
I'm sorry. I, I don't
follow what you're saying.

1280
01:23:29,693 --> 01:23:31,095
I was there and he wasn't.

1281
01:23:32,729 --> 01:23:34,198
Then he saw me.

1282
01:23:34,231 --> 01:23:37,101
We ran upstairs, we
struggled for the gun.

1283
01:23:37,134 --> 01:23:38,668
He won it.

1284
01:23:38,702 --> 01:23:40,104
He was gonna shoot me dead.

1285
01:23:41,038 --> 01:23:42,038
But he didn't.

1286
01:23:43,907 --> 01:23:45,475
Do you know why, Marilyn?

1287
01:23:47,244 --> 01:23:48,478
No.

1288
01:23:49,612 --> 01:23:51,115
Because someone else was there.

1289
01:23:53,817 --> 01:23:56,720
<i>Jared Clifton, your
stepdaughter's boyfriend.</i>

1290
01:23:57,921 --> 01:23:59,589
Are you joking?

1291
01:23:59,622 --> 01:24:02,193
Why would I joke about
something like that?

1292
01:24:02,226 --> 01:24:04,128
Well, I don't know.

1293
01:24:05,595 --> 01:24:08,798
He said he was just breaking
in and stealing some shit,

1294
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,567
that it was all
just a coincidence,

1295
01:24:12,203 --> 01:24:14,238
But that's a pretty huge
fucking coincidence,

1296
01:24:14,271 --> 01:24:15,271
don't you think?

1297
01:24:18,908 --> 01:24:20,510
So tell me it was just that.

1298
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:25,815
Coincidence. Nothing more.

1299
01:24:25,849 --> 01:24:27,817
It was, Connor.

1300
01:24:29,253 --> 01:24:32,056
Are you actually saying
that I could possibly...

1301
01:24:32,089 --> 01:24:33,089
I don't know,

1302
01:24:34,058 --> 01:24:35,925
but her boyfriend
and your boyfriend

1303
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:38,229
both broke into the same
house on the same night

1304
01:24:38,262 --> 01:24:40,930
and one of us
killed your husband,

1305
01:24:40,965 --> 01:24:43,067
which is awfully
fucking convenient.

1306
01:24:45,869 --> 01:24:48,538
I really don't like
what you're saying.

1307
01:24:49,939 --> 01:24:52,309
Well all I know is that
Jared Clifton was there

1308
01:24:52,343 --> 01:24:53,843
and he saved my life.

1309
01:24:55,379 --> 01:24:56,579
And then I shot him.

1310
01:24:57,381 --> 01:24:59,116
What?

1311
01:24:59,150 --> 01:25:00,717
Yeah. Why not?

1312
01:25:01,851 --> 01:25:03,087
It's the perfect alibi.

1313
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:06,756
I mean, your husband's gone.

1314

1315
01:25:07,992 --> 01:25:09,994
was just sitting
there on his knees.

1316
01:25:11,996 --> 01:25:15,032
So I did it and I made it look
like they killed each other.

1317
01:25:19,303 --> 01:25:20,303
That was my night.

1318
01:25:21,272 --> 01:25:22,273

1319
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:25,342
Shopping was good?

1320

I don't know what to
say to you right now.

Tell me that you need me.

1322

Tell me that it was worth it.

1323

It was.

1324
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:48,032
Okay. Fine.

1325
01:25:51,734 --> 01:25:55,239

do not call me again.

01:33:49,146 --> 01:33:51,648
(siren wails)

1443
01:34:19,509 --> 01:34:21,445
(no dialogue)

1444
01:34:33,890 --> 01:34:35,659
(tires squealing)

1445
01:35:07,357 --> 01:35:09,860
(sirens wail)

1446
01:35:27,511 --> 01:35:30,180
(Connor winces)

1447
01:36:00,911 --> 01:36:03,613
(Connor sobs)

1448
01:36:03,647 --> 01:36:08,685
Bates, these
people will kill you.

1449
01:36:09,319 --> 01:36:10,821
They are itching to do it.

1450
01:36:10,854 --> 01:36:12,856
I am begging you now.
- Oh no.

1451
01:36:12,889 --> 01:36:15,492
Get down on the ground
and stop this shit.

1452
01:36:16,426 --> 01:36:18,729
Now god dammit, do it son.

1453
01:36:20,731 --> 01:36:21,865
Just listen to me. Alright?

1454
01:36:24,668 --> 01:36:25,668
Just listen.

1455
01:36:28,538 --> 01:36:30,741
What have you done?

1456
01:36:30,774 --> 01:36:31,575
Well I don't. I don't.

1457
01:36:31,608 --> 01:36:32,608
What do you mean?

1458
01:36:35,412 --> 01:36:37,948
How did you know that
I was gonna come here?

1459
01:36:37,982 --> 01:36:39,016
If you didn't...

1460
01:36:41,052 --> 01:36:43,253
How could you possibly know?

1461
01:36:44,088 --> 01:36:47,959
How?
- We got a tip, okay?

1462
01:36:47,992 --> 01:36:48,992
Anonymous caller.

1463
01:36:50,427 --> 01:36:51,427
Some lady.

1464
01:36:52,462 --> 01:36:53,697
Don't lie to me.

1465
01:36:54,898 --> 01:36:57,434
I don't understand
what you're saying.

1466
01:36:57,467 --> 01:36:58,935
She told us right
where you'd be.

1467
01:37:01,738 --> 01:37:02,939
I, I don't believe you.

1468
01:37:03,607 --> 01:37:05,475
Get down on the
fucking ground now.

1469
01:37:05,509 --> 01:37:06,476
Gimme a second.

1470
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:08,879
Please. One second.

1471
01:37:08,912 --> 01:37:10,914
Very fidgety. Okay?

1472
01:37:10,947 --> 01:37:13,884
Just do what they say, please.

1473
01:37:13,917 --> 01:37:15,519
Nothing you're gonna regret.

1474
01:37:17,054 --> 01:37:18,588
I can't.

1475
01:37:19,556 --> 01:37:20,724
Alright, listen to me.

1476
01:37:20,757 --> 01:37:22,002
They have your
key ring. Alright?

1477
01:37:22,026 --> 01:37:25,829
Or a piece of it.
The little Indian coin.

1478
01:37:25,862 --> 01:37:26,862
They have it.

1479
01:37:29,666 --> 01:37:33,004
My, my key chain?

1480
01:37:33,037 --> 01:37:34,471
Must have dropped
it at the scene

1481
01:37:34,504 --> 01:37:36,373
or it broke or something.

1482
01:37:36,406 --> 01:37:37,574
I don't know.

1483
01:37:37,607 --> 01:37:38,607
They have it.

1484
01:37:39,476 --> 01:37:41,678
They found it in the house.

1485
01:37:41,711 --> 01:37:43,380
Oh no, no, no, no.

1486
01:37:47,084 --> 01:37:48,652
- Bates.
- That's not,

1487
01:37:48,685 --> 01:37:52,489
that's, that's,
that's not possible.

1488
01:37:52,522 --> 01:37:54,658
No. I'm telling
you that they do.

1489
01:37:54,691 --> 01:37:55,691
That's...

1490
01:37:57,894 --> 01:37:58,829
They have it.

1491
01:37:58,862 --> 01:38:00,965
Let's not make this
any worse than it is.

1492
01:38:03,034 --> 01:38:06,137
Hey, just get down.

1493
01:38:06,170 --> 01:38:07,404
Get down.

1494
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:17,880
Okay.

1495
01:38:18,915 --> 01:38:19,915
Okay.

1496
01:38:20,985 --> 01:38:22,019
Bates.

1497
01:38:24,021 --> 01:38:25,021
Get down.

1498
01:38:27,024 --> 01:38:27,959
(phone vibrates)

1499
01:38:27,992 --> 01:38:28,993
(tense music)

1500
01:38:29,026 --> 01:38:30,393
No, just get down.

1501
01:38:32,596 --> 01:38:34,031
Don't answer that.

1502
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:37,101
[Connor] I have to.

1503
01:38:37,134 --> 01:38:38,134
Hey!

1504
01:38:41,105 --> 01:38:42,139
Bates, no!

1505
01:38:42,173 --> 01:38:43,607
Bates, no!
(gunfire pops)

1506
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:45,742
No! Bates!

1507
01:38:46,476 --> 01:38:47,577
Bates, don't!

1508
01:38:48,578 --> 01:38:50,081
(gunfire pops)

1509
01:38:50,847 --> 01:38:51,815
Bates!

1510
01:38:51,848 --> 01:38:53,150
Put your gun down.

1511
01:38:57,021 --> 01:39:00,057
(birds squawking)

1512
01:39:33,991 --> 01:39:35,625
Bates? Bates?

1513
01:39:35,659 --> 01:39:38,996
(police radio garbling)

1514
01:39:49,706 --> 01:39:50,706
He's gone.

1515
01:40:19,303 --> 01:40:22,472
(water crashing)

1516
01:41:01,911 --> 01:41:02,911
Hello.

1517
01:41:04,048 --> 01:41:05,048
Hi.

1518
01:41:05,782 --> 01:41:07,284
How was the water?

1519
01:41:07,318 --> 01:41:08,752
It's colder than you think.

1520
01:41:13,157 --> 01:41:14,225
Did you steal this?

1521
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:17,294
I didn't return it.
It's different.

1522
01:41:18,229 --> 01:41:22,299
Ah, what happens at the end?

1523
01:41:24,768 --> 01:41:26,003
I don't know.

1524
01:41:26,037 --> 01:41:27,037
I didn't finish it.

1525
01:41:39,949 --> 01:41:42,719
(romantic music)

1526
01:41:49,893 --> 01:41:52,296
That's what I've
always wanted for us.

1527
01:41:53,197 --> 01:41:54,198
The minute we met.

1528
01:41:55,799 --> 01:41:57,034
You and me together.

1529
01:41:58,035 --> 01:41:59,035
Me too.

1530
01:42:00,037 --> 01:42:01,305
It's like a dream.

1531
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:04,140
Now it's real.

1532
01:42:05,409 --> 01:42:08,345
No one will ever come
between us ever again.

1533
01:42:13,084 --> 01:42:14,185
I love you.

1534
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:16,586
I love you too.

1535
01:42:17,321 --> 01:42:19,256
You promise?

1536
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:20,690
I promise.

1537
01:42:52,755 --> 01:42:55,292
(dramatic music)
