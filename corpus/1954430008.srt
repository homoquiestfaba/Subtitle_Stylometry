1
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:06,227
MARIANNE: Come on Zack!

2
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,110
Here. Now maybe you'll
stop bugging me.

3
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,000
Sierra Drivers!

4
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,830
Yes! Mom.
Thank you.

5
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,820
I wanted these so bad.
You are the coolest mom in the world.

6
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,370
- Don't wear them when you're playing.
- Duh.

7
00:02:51,448 --> 00:02:54,830
Look, I can't, I promised Emily
I'd go to the movies with her.

8
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,120
God, you're so pussy-whipped!

9
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,080
Fuck you, Chris.
I'm not whipped!

10
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,930
- That's so ridiculous.
- Right,

11
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:03,660
like you're not the most pussy-whipped
guy on the planet fucking Earth.

12
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,470
Just 'cause
I'm not a Neanderthal like you.

13
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,530
I can actually be friends with a girl.

14
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,250
Whipped!
Like everyone doesn't know.

15
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Give me a break.

16
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,940
Man, lately every time
I ask you something,

17
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,130
- it's always Emily this, Emily that...
- Come on, grow up.

18
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,900
You just hate girls.
You probably still run up...

19
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:23,050
- ...to them with dead frogs.
- Hate girls?

20
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,880
No! I don't hate girls. I love girls!

21
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,480
I just don't like them when
they're standing up.

22
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,800
Now I know why I hang out with you.

23
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,550
- 'Cause I got such a great line of shit?
- No,

24
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,290
'cause you make me feel so superior.

25
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,550
Face each other.

26
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,240
Chris says
I'm totally pussy-whipped.

27
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,390
That's a disgusting expression, Zack.

28
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,240
Well, you know what I mean.
People say I let Emily push me around.

29
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,408
Bullshit! Emily is such a sweet thing.
She adores you.

30
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:39,231
What are you talking about?

31
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,100
Well, people say I'm not the boss
in the relationship.

32
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,370
Like I'm not manly enough.
I don't know.

33
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,990
Chris Briggs is a total chauvinist.

34
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,360
I know, but you know I'm not like that.

35
00:04:51,997 --> 00:04:53,032
Everyone says I'm too...

36
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:55,678
...politically correct.
Whatever that actually means.

37
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,970
That means you're a sensitive kid and you
treat women with respect and as equals.

38
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,071
And to me that's a real man.

39
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,780
Thanks, Cindy.

40
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,070
Let's go blue! Go! Come on Zack!

41
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,040
Yes!

42
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,410
You know, that's a terrible habit.
Smoking gives you...

43
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,340
Gary! Don't be
King of the Nerds for a change.

44
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,324
Jerking off is a terrible habit too
but that doesn't seem to stop you.

45
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,842
Emily, I don't understand why you
hang around here while we're playing.

46
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,335
Well it's more peaceful.

47
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,980
And I get stuff done;
so I have more time later.

48
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,590
Study, study, study...

49
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,400
College, college, college...

50
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,780
College ain't all that
it's cracked up to be, ya know.

51
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,100
Oh really?

52
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,963
Look I know you think I'm stupid,

53
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,290
but lots of people become successful
without a college diploma.

54
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,950
Just look at that computer guy...

55
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,170
- What computer guy?
- That computer guy...

56
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,020
The Microsoft guy.
Dropped out of Harvard.

57
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,480
Made billions.
Think about it.

58
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,440
Bill Gates.

59
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,914
You know college doesn't hurt.

60
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:57,779
Yeah Em's right.
It gives you more options.

61
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:58,595
And...

62
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,510
I don't want to
hear a word from you!

63
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,010
Maybe for brainiacs like you guys.
Travis and me...

64
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,770
...we'll make it big our own way.

65
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,370
Yeah, speak for yourself, Dude.

66
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,880
Two kings, two twos.
Beat that, suckers!

67
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,610
Sorry, Charlie, three eights.

68
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:18,827
Fucking shit!

69
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,390
I think you better plan on
going to college, Chris;

70
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,160
'cause you're not going to make it
as a gambler.

71
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,810
You've got a kickback scheme
going on with your parents, don't you?

72
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,160
They leave town, and you
take all our money.

73
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,410
He's got enough now to buy you that
little bracelet with the diamonds in it.

74
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,620
Really!

75
00:07:37,842 --> 00:07:39,612
Oh shit!

76
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:45,170
Well, you know I would have no problem
with that whatsoever...

77
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,400
Yeah, I bet. When is the last time
you bought me something shiny?

78
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,840
That's not part of the deal, silly.

79
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,000
Men buy the nice things for ladies.
That's the deal.

80
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,250
Oh, that's the deal?
I'd like to see that in writing some day.

81
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,880
Men. Ha! I guess that
leaves you out, Zack.

82
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,630
Unless Emily knows
something we don't.

83
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:06,956
Alright, I'm gonna head out.

84
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:09,030
I think I've lost
enough money for one night.

85
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:10,293
Change your mind?

86
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:11,895
Nah, I've got to be
up early tomorrow.

87
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:12,932
More training?

88
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,077
I run in the morning.

89
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:15,894
Fuckin' Rocky Balboa over here!

90
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,910
Training for
the state fuckin' championship!

91
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,114
Too bad, it's gonna be some bash.

92
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:24,250
- Who's going over Chet's?
- Nah, I'm hanging here.

93
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,130
No you're not.
You're coming with me, dirtbag.

94
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,230
- Why?
- Zack is here with his squeeze, schmuck!

95
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,010
We're trying to give them a little room.
You brain-dead squirrel.

96
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,400
I'll see you guys.
Maybe we'll hook up tomorrow.

97
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,651
Bye.

98
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,700
So, you've thought about it?

99
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,990
Of course, I've thought about it!

100
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,060
Zack, I've dreamed about it.

101
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,200
So what are we waiting for?

102
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,540
Look stop! Stop!

103
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,010
Come on, we talked about this.

104
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,300
You said you'd never play
that game with me.

105
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,110
I'm not playing with you.

106
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,840
I'm not ready.

107
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,750
I told you, Zack.
I'm just...

108
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,440
I'm not ready,

109
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,190
that's all.

110
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,300
But hey,

111
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,416
come on.

112
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,370
When I am...

113
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,510
...there'll be no one but you.

114
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,890
You know that.

115
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,060
Get in the car!

116
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,600
Listen lady you have me mistaken
with someone else.

117
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:36,061
Lady this is some kind of mistake.

118
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,600
You must have me mixed up
with somebody else.

119
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,250
Not if your name is
Zachary Alan Butterfield.

120
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,650
And don't call me lady.
My name is April.

121
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,120
I don't get it!
Did I do something wrong?

122
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,489
Just shut up,
I'm not going to hurt you.

123
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,552
You already did.

124
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:53,242
Didn't I just tell you to shut up!

125
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,210
I'm just worried.

126
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,380
Maybe he's just hanging
with his friends.

127
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,030
Let's give it until one.

128
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,510
Please tell me what this is about?

129
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:41,469
If it's money,
my dad is just a professor at a college.

130
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:42,719
He's not rich or anything.

131
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:46,238
I don't want your dad's money.

132
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:47,870
Tell me what you want
maybe I can help.

133
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,312
Just keep walking.

134
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,040
This here's the kitchen.

135
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,370
I cook a lot.
I'm very good at it.

136
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,120
This is the office.

137
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,694
This is the library.

138
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,700
This is the guest room.

139
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,450
My bathroom.

140
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,720
My bedroom.
And this is your room.

141
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,370
For now, you'll have to stay in bed.

142
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,670
Be good and you'll be free to roam
around the house.

143
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,900
Wouldn't want you
wandering off by yourself.

144
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,850
These woods are kinda of isolated;

145
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,740
people die in them all the time.

146
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,430
I have a present for you.

147
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,950
This is a very special necklace.

148
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,991
Hold still.

149
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,600
Whose room was this?

150
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,600
No one's. I made it for you.

151
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,250
Looks great!

152
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,510
I might get one for myself.

153
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,282
Hey, I want to show you something.

154
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,790
So, you're free to walk around.

155
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,080
Well sort of...
There's an electronic perimeter fence.

156
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,680
Little transmitters in the ground
send off low frequency pulses...

157
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,100
...on the same frequency
as your necklace.

158
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,200
Oh, if you get to the perimeters edge,
it'll detonate your necklace.

159
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,850
Check out his necklace.

160
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,130
It's C-4.
Plastic explosive.

161
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,418
You can shape it into anything.
It's soft, like clay.

162
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,392
Each one of your beads
is stuffed with it.

163
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,347
This is the manual override.

164
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,199
Oh, yeah I forgot.

165
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,150
It's dead-switched.
Try and take it off...

166
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,250
...it'll break the circuit
and it'll explode by itself.

167
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,110
So, you're free to walk around.

168
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,010
Well sort of...

169
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,420
There's an electronic perimeter fence.

170
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,510
Oh, if you get to the perimeters
edge, it'll detonate your necklace.

171
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,850
Morning Sheriff.
Any news?

172
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,150
Morning.
No, sorry to say.

173
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,696
Can I come in for a minute?

174
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:04,656
Come on inside.

175
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,060
Thank you.

176
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:13,646
Thank you.

177
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,970
Sheriff are you still investigating us?

178
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,689
Look, I'm sorry about that polygraph
stuff this morning,

179
00:18:25,806 --> 00:18:28,176
- that's just standard procedure.
- Well it was horrible!

180
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,740
It was horrible to think,
you could think that...

181
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,350
- ...anyone could think that we...
- Honey.

182
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,400
Parents are always the first suspects.
We can't take any of this too personal.

183
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,730
Your husband is right.
We always look at the parents first.

184
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,120
We just wanted to eliminate you folks
as suspects so we could get on with it.

185
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,000
Our only interest is finding your son.

186
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,551
Now we're going to have to
take a look at his computer...

187
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:54,853
...that might hold the key
to this whole thing.

188
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:56,142
We've got guys,

189
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:59,500
- we call them computer forensic...
- No. Zack doesn't have a computer.

190
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,210
No, he doesn't.
We do, but...

191
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,450
Zack, he didn't have time for
any of that stuff, he was an athlete.

192
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,140
Doesn't he talk to his friends
on your computer?

193
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,350
No, listen, you take the computer.
Look at it. Look all you want.

194
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,480
But he didn't talk to
anybody on that thing.

195
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,360
No, he never did.
He said he didn't like to...

196
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,104
...he said he didn't type very well.

197
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:21,235
He didn't type "too good"
is what he said.

198
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:24,544
We encouraged him to use it -
and he would say that -

199
00:19:24,678 --> 00:19:25,820
and I would correct him,

200
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,820
"Not very well," I would say.
Zack, you don't type very well.

201
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,600
I'll send a deputy around
for it this afternoon.

202
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,570
Any way we can help, Sheriff.

203
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,470
Yeah well, I'll keep you posted.

204
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,480
One thing:

205
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,720
we talked to his teachers,
his friends, his coaches.

206
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,790
Was there anybody?
Was there a new man in his life?

207
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,540
- Somebody we didn't know about?
- A man?

208
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,110
Well yeah like...

209
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,460
...a casual acquaintance,
a truck driver,

210
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,490
- a karate buddy, something like that?
- No, he's a star athlete.

211
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,980
He's always training or playing.
He's busy, popular.

212
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:07,807
There a lot of girls buzzing around.
He has a lot of friends.

213
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:11,782
Yeah, Zack didn't know anybody that
we wouldn't have known about.

214
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,760
Well, I gotta ask about
drugs and alcohol.

215
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,280
I'm sure Zack has had a beer,
just like any guys his age,

216
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,480
maybe even took a hit off a joint...

217
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:23,352
- ...or something...
- No, Peter!

218
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,630
Listen, honey, this is no time...

219
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,050
...to start worrying about maintaining
some sort of social image.

220
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,730
No, Zack wouldn't pollute
his body with that garbage.

221
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,330
You know he's a fitness freak!

222
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,100
- I don't want him to think that...
- I know, all I'm saying...

223
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,940
...is that there's no way that
we could know what he did once...

224
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,015
...much less what he did
every second of his life...

225
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:45,203
Folks, folks. Take it easy.
Alright, I only meant...

226
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:48,285
...did he have a problem with that stuff?
Seems like he didn't.

227
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:51,856
I'm just covering all the bases here.
We...

228
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,745
We actually don't have
a clue of what's going on here.

229
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:03,990
The last time you saw him, he was out
running on Reynolds Road, you said.

230
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,770
Well, we've been up and down that road.

231
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,211
We've covered every inch of it.
There were no signs of violence.

232
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:18,209
Master Kwan, his Karate instructor,
told me he was a ferocious competitor.

233
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,928
Top of his class.

234
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,050
Right.

235
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:26,772
It's not likely anyone could take him
without a fight on their hands, right?

236
00:21:26,881 --> 00:21:28,480
- That's right.
- Well,

237
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,284
there's no evidence of that.

238
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,344
I think we have a walk-away here.

239
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,190
Mom? Dad?

240
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:26,950
Fuck!

241
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:36,391
If you're awake in there
that was the sound of...

242
00:22:36,517 --> 00:22:39,730
...your loud and obnoxious cell phone
being blown to pieces.

243
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:47,360
It's C-4.
Plastic explosive.

244
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,980
You can shape it into anything.
It's soft, like clay.

245
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,140
Each one of your beads
is stuffed with it.

246
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,044
It's dead-switched.
Try and take it off...

247
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:59,200
...it'll break the circuit
and it'll explode all by itself.

248
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,615
How did you know all my sizes?

249
00:23:23,942 --> 00:23:25,442
I know a lot about you Zack.

250
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,457
I've had my eye on you
for some time now.

251
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,000
I was watching you back when you
were kicking ass as a freshman forward.

252
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,940
Open it.

253
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,350
It's part of an Indian costume
for when we play Cowboys and Indians.

254
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,100
Do you like it?

255
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,760
This...

256
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,410
You're gonna love this.
This is something special.

257
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,730
You sit tight.

258
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,970
And I...

259
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,240
Forgive me Father
for I have sinned.

260
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,200
I haven't been to confession
in two weeks.

261
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,090
And my soul is black with sin.

262
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,960
And I have been a naughty girl.

263
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:34,684
Hey!

264
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,348
I'm going to do that
with someone else,

265
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,059
not with you.

266
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,080
It's time to earn your keep.

267
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,860
There's your uniform.
Go put it on.

268
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,780
Go put it on!

269
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,530
Pretty funny outfit?

270
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,010
It's to prevent you
from concealing anything from me.

271
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,810
I wouldn't want you transporting
any contraband into your room.

272
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,880
Come on.

273
00:25:29,714 --> 00:25:32,034
You're going to scrub the bathroom
until it shines.

274
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,758
It's done.

275
00:26:31,118 --> 00:26:32,305
Gleaming?

276
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,730
Like a beacon to passing aircraft.

277
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:38,909
What the hell?

278
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,290
It's a drink.

279
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,090
You ever had one?

280
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,000
No,

281
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,860
but I've thought about it.

282
00:26:51,725 --> 00:26:54,270
So smart.
So witty.

283
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,520
Such a cute little thing!

284
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,560
Come here.

285
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,539
Little son of a bitch.
I get the picture. What, I disgust you!

286
00:27:10,726 --> 00:27:14,040
Is that it? Get the fuck out of here!
Go to your room!

287
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,010
You want to play this game?

288
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,230
You know we
should really talk about how...

289
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,720
Zack?

290
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,740
What's wrong?
Are you sick?

291
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,580
Did something break?

292
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,940
I didn't beat you up that badly.

293
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,460
What am I going to do?

294
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,560
Got it.

295
00:29:00,194 --> 00:29:01,694
Let's see.

296
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,328
Shock. Fast but weak pulse?

297
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:11,234
Nope.

298
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,607
Feeling weak or nauseous?

299
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:15,902
Maybe you're depressed.

300
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,600
You better listen
and you better listen good.

301
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,740
I am the boss around here.

302
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,343
You better damn well answer me
when I'm talking to you!

303
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,440
I'll let it slide this time.

304
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,506
Don't expect me to be so lenient
in the future if you don't shape up.

305
00:29:40,105 --> 00:29:44,884
<i>Glory glory</i>

306
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,850
<i>hallelujah,</i>

307
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:58,020
<i>when I lay my</i>

308
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:03,420
<i>burden down.</i>

309
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,995
<i>Glory glory</i>

310
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,100
<i>hallelujah,</i>

311
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,876
<i>when I lay my</i>

312
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,937
<i>burden down.</i>

313
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,403
Thank you.

314
00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:30,304
- Professor.
- Sheriff.

315
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:39,413
This is Agent Quincannon,
Agent Harnett with the FBI.

316
00:30:39,681 --> 00:30:42,629
- The Bureau is helping us out.
- Thank God.

317
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,450
We don't have any leads
as to Zack's whereabouts.

318
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,381
There's no evidence of any kind.
There were no witnesses.

319
00:30:56,234 --> 00:30:58,434
The State Police have canceled
the search,

320
00:30:58,505 --> 00:31:01,530
and the Town Police have decided
to close the case.

321
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,885
I on the other hand have decided to
hold it open as "unresolved."

322
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:09,620
That way if anything new comes in,

323
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:14,200
I can reinstitute the search
for Zack right away.

324
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,740
Folks, I have to be honest with you,

325
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,990
the chances of us finding him
at this point are pretty slim.

326
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:22,430
I'm not sure I understand
what you're saying.

327
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:27,500
Stranger abductions don't usually occur
with kids this old.

328
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,260
You guys are good people,

329
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,440
I wouldn't want
this to hijack your life.

330
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,470
This can be
very destructive to families.

331
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:38,947
My best advice to you...

332
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,653
...is to move on.
He'll get it touch eventually.

333
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,804
Agent Quincannon, do you have kids?

334
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:47,625
No.

335
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:49,251
No, I didn't think so.

336
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,990
Let me tell you something.

337
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,057
Your child is not just a responsibility,
like a pet.

338
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,982
Loving your child with all your heart...

339
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,650
...is not a choice.
It's not a decision.

340
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:06,696
It's a truck that hits you
the day they're born...

341
00:32:06,817 --> 00:32:09,401
...and stays parked on your heart
for the rest of your life!

342
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,202
Honey...

343
00:32:10,338 --> 00:32:12,785
No! If you think for one minute...

344
00:32:12,826 --> 00:32:16,221
...that I'm going to just let this go,

345
00:32:16,408 --> 00:32:18,550
than you've got another think coming.

346
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,500
You're really beautiful.

347
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,170
You're drop-dead gorgeous,
you know that?

348
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,220
I'm flattered.
That's flattering.

349
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,873
You know, you can be really nice.

350
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,070
I think you're growing on me.

351
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,740
This is fabulous.

352
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,540
Well, I make it from scratch.

353
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,800
I bet you could make money
selling this stuff.

354
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,742
Well, I could show
you how to make it.

355
00:32:51,008 --> 00:32:52,143
Would you?

356
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,919
Well, no time like the present.

357
00:32:58,471 --> 00:33:00,081
It's never easy with kids.

358
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:05,682
No, but personally I think
some pedophile has got him.

359
00:33:05,878 --> 00:33:08,993
And if he does, those guys are really...

360
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,485
Maybe you shouldn't assume it's a guy.

361
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,150
What?

362
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,610
Could be a woman.

363
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,648
I hate you fuckin' FBI guys.
You think you know everything.

364
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,640
But...

365
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,320
...we do.

366
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:37,679
Remember, 6 tablespoons of salt
in every gallon of boiling water.

367
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:39,462
Then you let the water cool.

368
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:42,124
Then you add
the warm water to the cheese curds.

369
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,690
And then you mash the cheese curds up.

370
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,632
And then you can add
a little bit more water...

371
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:51,030
...until you have a well-formed ball.

372
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,250
Where did you learn all this?

373
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,804
My mother was a great cook
that evil bitch.

374
00:33:57,308 --> 00:33:59,166
At least she took
the time to teach you all...

375
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,538
She never taught me shit!

376
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,370
I learned from watching.

377
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:09,107
I watched her prepare meals
for my dad and for Smiling Jack.

378
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,303
She never taught me shit.

379
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,050
This was Dad's favorite room.

380
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,850
He used to come in here and escape.
Mom was this tyrannical bitch.

381
00:35:05,094 --> 00:35:09,076
She used to spew her venomous crap
at anyone around her.

382
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,378
One day he just upped and left.

383
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,650
No note, no goodbye,

384
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,430
no fight.

385
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,010
I was nine, and...

386
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,360
...'poof' no more dad.

387
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:30,240
But soon mom had a new boyfriend,
Smiling Jack.

388
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,660
- Was he a good guy?
- Yes.

389
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,981
He was a career Army guy,
a Captain.

390
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:45,187
He was the one who taught me
how to hunt and shoot, ride and fish.

391
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,513
He was the one that got me
started in martial arts.

392
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,602
He loved my mom, though...

393
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,069
...he used to put on
that old record "Irene, Goodnight"...

394
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:02,638
...when he was drunk
and sing along to it.

395
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:07,324
He was like a real dad to me.
A good dad.

396
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,460
- She wasn't mean to him?
- No,

397
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,000
she watched her step around Jack.

398
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,927
She knew she had a good thing.

399
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:16,628
What she like about him?

400
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,208
She liked his disability checks.

401
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:23,677
He got wounded in the first Iraq war.

402
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,950
He was much older than her.

403
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:33,026
I want to show you someting.

404
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:39,860
You're the first person
to be in this room since he died.

405
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,680
One day,
my mom had had enough of both of us.

406
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,500
She just took off.

407
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,300
Said she was going to buy cigarettes...

408
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,143
...never came back.

409
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,590
Gone just like my dad.

410
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,510
But Jack, though...

411
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,840
...he never stopped loving her,
even after she left us.

412
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,570
As he got older and sicker,
I...

413
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,990
...spent most of my time
taking care of him.

414
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,250
Letting my...

415
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,059
...entire girlhood years...

416
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,200
...pass me by.

417
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,920
No proms, no boyfriends...

418
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,920
...no girlfriends, no sleepovers...

419
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,520
...nobody.

420
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,760
My God.

421
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,810
Maybe that is not entirely true.

422
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,780
Smiling Jack loved me...

423
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,860
...in his own way.

424
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,700
I'm flattered you
shared that with me.

425
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,870
Right.

426
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,820
Where was I?

427
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,660
It took some time to get over him.

428
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,490
What happened to him?

429
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,600
He died.

430
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,850
Alcohol I think.

431
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,793
Liver. Kidneys.
It was bad.

432
00:38:37,957 --> 00:38:40,097
By the end, he wasn't too coherent.

433
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,880
Want to know the kicker?

434
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,875
I took care of him for ten years,
day in and day out.

435
00:38:47,054 --> 00:38:48,539
I was devoted.

436
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,620
His last words were "Irene."

437
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,444
Irene.

438
00:38:54,842 --> 00:38:55,725
Irene?

439
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,070
My mom.

440
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,910
Damn!

441
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,960
One day I just I said,
"Fuck it! I'm out of here."

442
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:13,080
I took off.
Next thing I know I enlist in the Army,

443
00:39:13,238 --> 00:39:15,887
and I am on my way to Afghanistan.

444
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,670
It was totally cool.

445
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,270
I loved it.

446
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,970
I had a lot of fun.

447
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,150
They kept giving me
more training.

448
00:39:27,344 --> 00:39:30,917
I got along with the guys.
Before I knew it I was in Iraq.

449
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,047
You did the war over there?

450
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,670
Yeah, I did the war.

451
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,821
The war did me.

452
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,280
They recruited me. I signed on and...

453
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,744
...I was in Iraq having more
fun and games with the Arabs.

454
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,500
Holy shit. Dangerous.

455
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,190
Yeah, it was pretty wild.

456
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,912
So you were with mostly guys?

457
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:57,914
Mostly.

458
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,950
Did any of them become,
like your boyfriend?

459
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,484
What do you mean?

460
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,996
They must have noticed
how beautiful you were.

461
00:40:05,247 --> 00:40:06,633
I mean they're guys.

462
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,308
You said when you were growing up you
had no boyfriend.

463
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:11,505
I'm just wondering,
if that changed in the Army.

464
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,720
You're a very smart boy, Zack.

465
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,720
How am I smart?

466
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,960
You're trying to get into my head.

467
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,130
You've been paying attention.

468
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,570
Aren't you something.

469
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,650
My first time was
on the hood of a Humvee,

470
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,220
in an olive grove outside of Kabul.

471
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,190
He was an 18 year old corporal
from Oklahoma.

472
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,810
I woke up in the morning alone,

473
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,600
hungover, blood dripping down my leg.

474
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,710
What would you wish for if a genie
offered you three wishes?

475
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,240
I'd wish for all those years back...

476
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,110
...all my teenage years.

477
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,650
All of them.

478
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,935
I'd wish for a mom and a dad and a...

479
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,171
...high school prom.

480
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,890
What's with the bald walls?

481
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,180
No pictures or paintings?

482
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,540
Acoustics, it's the music room.

483
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,660
Oh.

484
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,400
Why are we here?

485
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,520
Just a hunch.

486
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:40,040
Good morning! Thought I let
you sleep in for a change.

487
00:42:40,188 --> 00:42:40,962
Thanks.

488
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:42,867
Food is on the stove.

489
00:42:43,076 --> 00:42:44,576
It might be warm.

490
00:42:48,368 --> 00:42:53,150
<i>Well you wake up in the morning,</i>

491
00:42:53,819 --> 00:42:57,480
<i>hear the work bell ring;</i>

492
00:42:58,107 --> 00:43:02,410
<i>you go marching to the table,</i>

493
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:06,370
<i>you see the same damn thing.</i>

494
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:10,583
<i>All on one table,</i>

495
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:14,511
<i>a fork, knife and a pan.</i>

496
00:43:15,054 --> 00:43:19,130
<i>And if you say a word about it,</i>

497
00:43:19,545 --> 00:43:23,300
<i>you're in trouble with the Man.</i>

498
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:27,857
<i>Let the midnight special</i>

499
00:43:28,497 --> 00:43:31,650
<i>shine it's light on me,</i>

500
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:36,270
<i>let the midnight special</i>

501
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:39,950
<i>shine it's light on me.</i>

502
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:44,370
<i>Now if you ever go to Houston,</i>

503
00:43:44,902 --> 00:43:48,120
<i>boy you better do right.</i>

504
00:43:49,271 --> 00:43:52,540
<i>You better not stagger,</i>

505
00:43:52,822 --> 00:43:56,000
<i>and you better not fight.</i>

506
00:43:56,674 --> 00:44:00,300
<i>Sheriff, he'll arrest you.</i>

507
00:44:00,786 --> 00:44:04,010
<i>He'll carry you down,</i>

508
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:08,800
<i>and if the jury finds you guilty,</i>

509
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:12,310
<i>you're penitentiary bound.</i>

510
00:44:12,894 --> 00:44:17,042
<i>Let the midnight special</i>

511
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:21,110
<i>shine it's light on me.</i>

512
00:44:21,394 --> 00:44:25,092
<i>Let the midnight special</i>

513
00:44:25,344 --> 00:44:29,200
<i>shine it's light on me.</i>

514
00:44:29,494 --> 00:44:33,410
<i>Let the midnight special</i>

515
00:44:33,512 --> 00:44:37,290
<i>shine it's light on me.</i>

516
00:44:37,557 --> 00:44:41,577
<i>Let the midnight special</i>

517
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,310
<i>shine it's ever loving light on me.</i>

518
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,400
You're so good!

519
00:45:03,831 --> 00:45:06,684
Full of surprises this morning.

520
00:45:06,824 --> 00:45:08,504
You ain't seen nothing.

521
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,490
Since you've been such a good boy.

522
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,740
I have enough of this
to keep us well-fed forever.

523
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,210
Can I ask you a personal question?

524
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,910
I think we're
on sufficiently intimate terms.

525
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,320
What?

526
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:52,260
Yes, you may.
Ask away.

527
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,510
You're a beautiful woman.
You know that, right?

528
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,950
Don't try to play me, sonny boy,
it ain't gonna work.

529
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,600
I've been played by the best.

530
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,220
You think I'm playing you?

531
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,780
You should try trusting
somebody sometime.

532
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,700
Do you think I was
playing you last night?

533
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,760
You played me like a fiddle.

534
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,100
Only you didn't know it.

535
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,890
OK, point taken.
What's your question?

536
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,300
You do know, you're
drop-dead gorgeous, right?

537
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:28,590
- This is your personal question?
- No,

538
00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:30,590
what I mean is...

539
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,850
...you could have
any man you want.

540
00:47:33,752 --> 00:47:35,592
Why would you pick a kid like me?

541
00:47:35,931 --> 00:47:38,956
- Men suck.
- Than why don't you go lesbian?

542
00:47:39,088 --> 00:47:42,385
- Because, I like men.
- But you just said they suck.

543
00:47:42,558 --> 00:47:45,846
That's the problem.
I like men, but they suck.

544
00:47:46,306 --> 00:47:47,701
Hence you.

545
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,990
You lost me again.

546
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,960
I figured teachers you see on the news.

547
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:54,800
They're on to something.

548
00:47:55,085 --> 00:47:58,135
You know find themselves a boy
before they become a man...

549
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,370
...and your make your own man.

550
00:48:01,085 --> 00:48:02,585
And here you are,

551
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,540
you're a man,

552
00:48:06,026 --> 00:48:07,784
and you don't suck.

553
00:48:08,003 --> 00:48:10,855
- I'm a man now?
- Yeah. How does it feel?

554
00:48:11,113 --> 00:48:12,837
I don't feel any different.

555
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,520
Actually, I guess I do.

556
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,980
More mature, more grown up,
maybe more confident.

557
00:48:22,517 --> 00:48:25,217
But I think I was
happier when I was a boy.

558
00:49:21,803 --> 00:49:24,313
So no matter how much gas I
put in it;

559
00:49:24,492 --> 00:49:26,218
the fuel gauge reads empty.

560
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,298
Well Richard taking a look at it now,

561
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:30,972
but it's probably the sending unit
that's no good on it.

562
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:39,270
- Could you to do me a big favor.
- What's that?

563
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:43,150
Can you move all the furniture
out of here and wax the floors?

564
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,880
OK.

565
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:49,360
Thank you.

566
00:50:00,829 --> 00:50:03,700
- Do you mind if I put a poster up?
- Sure.

567
00:50:03,932 --> 00:50:05,432
Thanks.

568
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,490
Jimmy on that Honda,
it's a sending unit.

569
00:50:11,936 --> 00:50:15,010
Mike on your car
the sending unit is no good...

570
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:17,519
...and it's probably going
to take a day or so...

571
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:20,261
...before we could get the part in.

572
00:50:21,548 --> 00:50:24,810
That does me no good.
I've got to be in Boston tonight.

573
00:50:26,342 --> 00:50:28,546
I've got to drive straight through.

574
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:32,122
Alright, what I suggest is keep
the gas tank full...

575
00:50:32,459 --> 00:50:35,854
...and just watch the odometer
and have a safe trip.

576
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,151
- What do I owe you?
- Forget about it.

577
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:41,780
Thank you.
Have a good day.

578
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:32,600
Morning Professor Butterfield.

579
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:34,313
Peter, please.

580
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,742
Peter, I see that the heat
doesn't slow you down.

581
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,761
It might be time to stop now.

582
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:41,752
How is your wife holding up?

583
00:51:42,193 --> 00:51:45,712
As well as could be expected, I guess.
She is out putting up those posters.

584
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,400
Come on inside.

585
00:51:49,288 --> 00:51:51,900
This sure is
a scorcher out there.

586
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:57,430
I got to tell you, Peter.

587
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:02,570
I've been doing this for 30 years,
this one really got me stumped.

588
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:06,450
I've never been
as clueless as I am now.

589
00:52:08,727 --> 00:52:13,210
The other day, you guys said that you
didn't believe there was any foul play.

590
00:52:13,694 --> 00:52:15,960
Impossible. I know my son...

591
00:52:17,898 --> 00:52:19,898
...not with rose-colored glasses
or anything.

592
00:52:20,155 --> 00:52:21,340
We were guys together.

593
00:52:21,563 --> 00:52:22,863
We talked about everything.

594
00:52:23,115 --> 00:52:25,108
I know him as well
as you know an old friend.

595
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,100
You're saying he had no secrets?

596
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:29,669
Not from me. I'll bet on that.

597
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:31,469
All parents think
they know their kid,

598
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:32,630
it's practically a cliché.

599
00:52:32,728 --> 00:52:33,479
No offense.

600
00:52:33,581 --> 00:52:35,951
We talked about intimate stuff. Sex,

601
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:38,478
masturbation, STDs, drugs, booze.

602
00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:41,075
We talked about that
stuff anywhere, anytime.

603
00:52:41,587 --> 00:52:43,100
We were friends.

604
00:52:46,411 --> 00:52:49,107
That's great that you and your wife
have this candid...

605
00:52:49,357 --> 00:52:52,064
My wife was not involved in any...

606
00:52:52,322 --> 00:52:55,080
- ...of those conversations.
- It was a guy thing.

607
00:52:55,275 --> 00:53:00,200
Yeah, and Marianne
respected that.

608
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:02,510
Do you have any suspicions?

609
00:53:05,725 --> 00:53:07,590
- Could there be a problem with the girl?
- No.

610
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:10,581
A previous boyfriend?
A jealous ex...

611
00:53:10,838 --> 00:53:14,850
No. We interviewed the hell out of her
and Chris Briggs.

612
00:53:17,381 --> 00:53:22,280
Let me ask you, you said that you
talked about to Zack drugs and booze.

613
00:53:22,871 --> 00:53:26,700
Why would you talk to Zack about
drugs and booze, if he didn't do them?

614
00:53:27,026 --> 00:53:29,360
He didn't, so he had lots of questions.

615
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:35,330
Me being a child of the eighties
I had lots of answers.

616
00:53:38,606 --> 00:53:41,223
I know he tried to smoke my cigars
once in a while.

617
00:53:41,941 --> 00:53:43,674
Had a beer. He is a
real boy, after all.

618
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:45,645
That's harmless shit.

619
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,441
You're right about one thing though.

620
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,356
It wouldn't have been easy to take him.

621
00:53:53,614 --> 00:53:55,242
What all that karate stuff?

622
00:53:55,505 --> 00:53:56,225
Yeah.

623
00:53:56,982 --> 00:54:00,139
Whoever took him had a real fight
on their hands.

624
00:54:03,152 --> 00:54:05,240
You did a wonderful job, Zack!

625
00:54:06,313 --> 00:54:09,188
- I'm impressed.
- I surprise myself sometimes.

626
00:54:10,717 --> 00:54:15,031
Well let's get you cleaned up,
tonight is a very special night.

627
00:54:41,835 --> 00:54:48,057
You look so handsome
like a leading man in a classic film.

628
00:54:48,192 --> 00:54:51,412
I never had one of these on before.

629
00:54:51,662 --> 00:54:53,700
Follow my lead my Prince.

630
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,710
Good you're awake.

631
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,440
I brought you some yum yums.

632
00:56:35,044 --> 00:56:39,017
- This looks really good.
- You know everything I've said to you...

633
00:56:39,107 --> 00:56:42,129
...these past couple of days
has come from the bottom of my heart.

634
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:44,030
Same here.

635
00:56:45,074 --> 00:56:47,560
Good, I just wanted to get that out.

636
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:53,990
Well I'll let you eat.
I have some things I need to attend to.

637
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:23,155
I have breaking news from,
I da' ho'. You da' ho'?

638
00:57:23,366 --> 00:57:27,480
I don't know where the fuck I am!
I have an exclusive interview with Zack,

639
00:57:27,597 --> 00:57:30,585
an extraordinary boy who escaped
from the clutches of a kidnapper.

640
00:57:30,757 --> 00:57:32,702
Zack, how did you escape?

641
00:57:33,561 --> 00:57:37,900
I pimped my way into her good favor.
Then, I sprang my escape plan on her ass.

642
00:57:38,403 --> 00:57:40,841
I can see that, can you describe her?

643
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:44,093
Yeah, tall, crazy...

644
00:57:44,351 --> 00:57:45,851
...psycho bitch lady.

645
00:57:47,404 --> 00:57:50,760
- Why'd she do it?
- She wanted my ample package.

646
00:57:52,228 --> 00:57:55,635
- Where did she keep you?
- She kept me locked up in a bedroom...

647
00:57:55,746 --> 00:57:58,766
...with a chain long enough
to clean the bathrooms.

648
00:57:58,907 --> 00:58:00,550
Did you know this lady from anywhere?

649
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,297
No, she came out of nowhere
and did a drive-by kidnapping.

650
00:58:04,531 --> 00:58:07,671
What become of
this crazy psycho killer bitch?

651
00:58:07,929 --> 00:58:10,300
She is over there
being put in chains by the police.

652
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:12,714
She's going to the big house.

653
00:58:12,972 --> 00:58:15,890
- Can I say something?
- Go right ahead.

654
00:58:16,148 --> 00:58:17,976
I want to say hi to my mom and dad,

655
00:58:18,067 --> 00:58:20,994
and whut-up to my shorty, Emily. Yo, Em!

656
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:31,262
Shit, I'm never going to
get out of here alive.

657
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:35,170
Dinner is ready.

658
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:38,670
Good. I am famished.

659
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:41,300
Zack, dinner is ready!

660
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,020
Honey.

661
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:55,392
Do you think we were too lenient?
Gave him too much space?

662
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:58,080
No way.

663
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:01,919
If Zack ran away,
it had nothing to do with us.

664
01:00:04,277 --> 01:00:06,024
There has got to be somebody.

665
01:00:15,718 --> 01:00:17,369
Lady this is some kind of mistake.

666
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,702
You must have me mixed up
with somebody else.

667
01:00:19,968 --> 01:00:22,700
Not if your name is
Zachary Alan Butterfield.

668
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:26,030
You're going to scrub the bathroom
until it shines.

669
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:33,540
<i>when I lay my</i>

670
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,630
<i>burden down.</i>

671
01:00:38,078 --> 01:00:41,430
Little son of a bitch!
I get the picture! What, I disgust you!

672
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:44,922
Is that it? Get the fuck out of here!
Go to your room!

673
01:00:54,099 --> 01:00:56,940
Right. Where was I?

674
01:00:58,083 --> 01:00:59,845
This is the manual override.

675
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:54,369
When you get a chance,
my sink is leaking.

676
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:55,593
Really?

677
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:59,601
- It is going to rot everything below it.
- How bad is it?

678
01:01:59,874 --> 01:02:02,304
It only happens when I use the faucet.

679
01:02:02,547 --> 01:02:05,470
Then it can wait.
Where were we?

680
01:02:16,292 --> 01:02:19,580
- Thank you, I really appreciate it.
- It's the least I can do.

681
01:02:19,753 --> 01:02:21,859
- I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
- Bye

682
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,420
- Hello
- Hi

683
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:26,531
Well, hello.

684
01:02:26,789 --> 01:02:28,078
Hey Mrs. Butterfield.

685
01:02:28,314 --> 01:02:31,000
- What is this?
- It's quiche lorraine.

686
01:02:31,763 --> 01:02:33,620
- Want to come in?
- Yeah, thanks.

687
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,360
Great.

688
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:42,840
We love quiche. That was so thoughful!
And you made it yourself?

689
01:02:43,673 --> 01:02:46,304
Yeah, it's only the scond time
I ever did.

690
01:02:46,506 --> 01:02:47,988
So, I hope it's OK.

691
01:02:48,129 --> 01:02:51,720
I'm sure it is. It is beautiful.
Would you like some cookies and milk?

692
01:02:51,909 --> 01:02:53,041
Yeah, sure.

693
01:02:53,189 --> 01:02:54,915
Peter, cookies and milk?

694
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:56,633
Sure.

695
01:02:58,309 --> 01:03:00,276
- Hi Em.
- Hi Mr. Butterfieild.

696
01:03:00,431 --> 01:03:01,807
Now, I can't believe...

697
01:03:01,893 --> 01:03:05,026
...they expelled Chris Briggs
just for talking back to his teacher.

698
01:03:05,158 --> 01:03:10,779
I know. Talk about strict.
He was going to graduate in a few months.

699
01:03:11,872 --> 01:03:16,394
You know Mandy told me about it, 'cause
she was there when it happened.

700
01:03:16,808 --> 01:03:20,952
Ms. Bennett told Chris
in front of the whole class that...

701
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,302
...she wasn't surpriised...

702
01:03:22,421 --> 01:03:24,789
...that he couldn't answer
a question about women's suffrage.

703
01:03:25,031 --> 01:03:29,386
"After all, what do men care
about the toils of women?" she said.

704
01:03:29,644 --> 01:03:32,102
And then he said,

705
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:37,147
"Well, I care deeply for women, just
as long as they're not standing up."

706
01:03:37,412 --> 01:03:38,289
He said that?

707
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:39,085
Yeah.

708
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:44,110
- My God.
- As you can imagine she blew her top.

709
01:03:44,357 --> 01:03:49,902
She told him to get out of her class and
down to the Principal's office.

710
01:03:50,096 --> 01:03:56,214
Then she decides she's gonna leave the
teaching assistant to finish class,

711
01:03:56,414 --> 01:03:59,540
- and escorted him there herself.
- You don't say.

712
01:04:00,326 --> 01:04:02,797
I know.

713
01:04:03,265 --> 01:04:05,210
No one stood up for Chris...

714
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:07,707
...that surprised me, because...

715
01:04:08,354 --> 01:04:13,144
...she was always persecuting the boys.
Everyone knew it.

716
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:16,720
She is like this feminist fanatic.

717
01:04:17,182 --> 01:04:20,110
All the kids are afraid
to stand up to her.

718
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:25,360
The great Lady Hildegarde Bitch-Bennett.

719
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:29,190
- Her name is Hildegarde?
- No, we just call her that.

720
01:04:29,902 --> 01:04:33,120
Lady Hildegarde Bitch-Bennett.
That is really quite imaginative.

721
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,071
Yeah, but...

722
01:04:36,277 --> 01:04:38,910
if Zack had been there, I know he...

723
01:04:44,303 --> 01:04:47,130
You know what, I better get going.

724
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,411
I hope you like the quiche.

725
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:51,728
Stop by any time,

726
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:54,230
I do enjoy catching up with you.

727
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,559
Are you OK to walk home?
I can give you a ride?

728
01:04:57,951 --> 01:05:01,310
No, don't worry about it,
I'll be fine.

729
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,190
See you guys around.

730
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:32,570
As promised, I've come
to save the day.

731
01:06:06,251 --> 01:06:10,800
Did you know plumbers get
200 dollars an hour.

732
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:16,005
You know that amazes me.

733
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:27,430
You're all set.

734
01:06:29,856 --> 01:06:32,690
This is my upper body
strength force-multiplier.

735
01:06:36,404 --> 01:06:38,249
This gave me the leverage to remove...

736
01:06:38,336 --> 01:06:41,156
...and install every kind
of pipe in this house.

737
01:06:43,496 --> 01:06:47,253
Having the right tool is everything.
Whoever said,

738
01:06:47,339 --> 01:06:51,176
"Never send a woman to do
a man's job." Never met me.

739
01:06:56,814 --> 01:07:00,204
You're welcome?
Oh, it was nothing!

740
01:07:00,548 --> 01:07:02,983
You never appreciate anything I
do around here.

741
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,980
God! You fucking little shit.

742
01:07:05,147 --> 01:07:07,580
The next time you want
something done, you do it yourself.

743
01:07:07,744 --> 01:07:09,916
Don't come crying to me about it.

744
01:07:10,057 --> 01:07:11,119
Thank you.

745
01:07:11,451 --> 01:07:13,730
You changed
my whole outlook on plumbing.

746
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:18,230
Fuck plumbing! You need to change
your whole outlook on women.

747
01:07:20,486 --> 01:07:22,791
If you're all that
why didn't you install the fucking...

748
01:07:22,967 --> 01:07:24,697
...pipe right in the first place.

749
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,452
Discipline would be easy,
if he wasn't so talented.

750
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:23,080
Sit down.

751
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:32,730
You've never had a steak
like this in your whole life.

752
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:36,220
And these are my very
special garlic basil mashed potatoes.

753
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:47,040
Well?

754
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,790
What?

755
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:50,560
How is it?

756
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:52,880
Good.

757
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,740
Good.

758
01:08:58,090 --> 01:09:00,431
Good. Yeah. Really. Real, good.

759
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,936
You want to try a new song?

760
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:17,050
What? After lunch?

761
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:18,960
Yes, that's what I meant.

762
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:24,240
Yeah, OK.

763
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:49,150
Who could that be?

764
01:09:58,612 --> 01:10:00,650
- Hello there.
- Can I help you?

765
01:10:03,703 --> 01:10:05,908
I'm sorry to bother you.

766
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:07,221
My car broke down.

767
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:10,420
I mean it ran out of gas
way down the road.

768
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:14,210
My phone won't work.
I got no signal.

769
01:10:15,525 --> 01:10:17,713
Do you have a phone
that I could use?

770
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:22,325
No.

771
01:10:25,964 --> 01:10:27,565
I'm sorry for bothering you.

772
01:10:27,753 --> 01:10:31,095
- I know, I'm some random guy.
- There's a store 5 miles away.

773
01:10:31,173 --> 01:10:32,673
You can hitch.

774
01:10:33,339 --> 01:10:36,872
Let me ask you something,
is that your kid brother?

775
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:39,010
Just now...

776
01:10:43,309 --> 01:10:45,773
You know what, I'll be OK.
Never mind.

777
01:11:18,628 --> 01:11:20,361
You really fucked up on this one.

778
01:11:20,492 --> 01:11:21,311
What did I do?

779
01:11:21,419 --> 01:11:22,677
We'll talk about it later. Now,

780
01:11:22,786 --> 01:11:25,459
I have to go for a ride
and do some heavy lifting.

781
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:34,860
This is so you can think about what you
did, and what happened because of it.

782
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:08,688
Oh yeah.

783
01:13:25,046 --> 01:13:26,766
Oh yeah!

784
01:14:41,152 --> 01:14:44,853
So, the drunken asshole passed out
behind the wheel.

785
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,020
He drove his car straight
into Lake Cornwall.

786
01:14:48,497 --> 01:14:50,700
He wasn't wearing his seat belt so...

787
01:14:50,952 --> 01:14:53,856
...when the air bag deployed,
it broke his neck.

788
01:14:54,027 --> 01:14:56,555
It'll do that if you're not wearing
your seatbelt, you know.

789
01:14:56,731 --> 01:14:58,660
April, I didn't do anything.

790
01:15:00,068 --> 01:15:03,470
He had it on cruise control.
It went in at full speed.

791
01:15:03,579 --> 01:15:06,978
Nobody goes to that lake.
It's very deep. There's no fish.

792
01:15:07,264 --> 01:15:11,550
And if they do go there,
it'll be a very long time from now.

793
01:15:11,791 --> 01:15:13,572
Please let me go?

794
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:18,090
I'm going to let you stay here all night
and contemplate the error of your ways.

795
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:38,202
I suppose I have to feed you.

796
01:15:39,632 --> 01:15:42,433
- You killed that guy.
- It's what I do best.

797
01:15:42,657 --> 01:15:44,157
Killing people?

798
01:15:44,392 --> 01:15:47,568
The Army spent a lot of money teaching
me how to do that.

799
01:15:47,818 --> 01:15:49,488
I got real good.

800
01:15:50,072 --> 01:15:56,130
They reward soldiers for killing.
Medals, promotions, pats on the back.

801
01:15:56,387 --> 01:15:59,389
But this isn't the war,
you're home now.

802
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:02,310
Well, you don't just turn it off.

803
01:16:02,822 --> 01:16:06,890
It becomes easy, efficient.
It becomes second nature.

804
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,880
Is this that
"post-trauma" war thing?

805
01:16:10,493 --> 01:16:15,969
What post-traumatic stress disorder.
Please. I served with a lot of men who...

806
01:16:16,062 --> 01:16:19,576
...loved every second of it.
That is just bullshit shrinks think of...

807
01:16:19,639 --> 01:16:22,283
...so they don't have to deal
with the essential nature of mankind.

808
01:16:22,402 --> 01:16:24,088
What's
"the essential nature of mankind?"

809
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:25,459
They are killers.

810
01:16:26,154 --> 01:16:28,957
They're the most successful predators...

811
01:16:29,179 --> 01:16:31,533
...in the history of life
on this planet.

812
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:37,000
And you can't figure out why I
have trouble sleeping at night.

813
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,000
What?

814
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,180
Nothing.

815
01:16:50,387 --> 01:16:52,169
Get up you little twerp.

816
01:17:00,283 --> 01:17:04,878
We're going to have this discussion now.
That was a lame stunt you pulled today.

817
01:17:05,363 --> 01:17:08,700
Jesus Christ! What now?
What stunt?

818
01:17:08,782 --> 01:17:11,510
You were signalling your presence
to that stranger.

819
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:15,650
I thought we were through with that.

820
01:17:17,076 --> 01:17:19,840
I thought we had bonded -
that we were a team.

821
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:26,948
We laughed. We loved.
We sang together. We were great!

822
01:17:27,214 --> 01:17:29,470
- What went wrong?
- Nothing.

823
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:32,960
Nothing went wrong.
You're just suspecting it. We're good.

824
01:17:33,234 --> 01:17:35,015
We better be fucking good.

825
01:17:35,232 --> 01:17:38,187
April, what can I do
to make you feel better about...

826
01:17:38,366 --> 01:17:40,461
You can sit back down!

827
01:17:46,436 --> 01:17:49,155
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a shotgun.

828
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:51,320
It's a twelve gauge shotgun.

829
01:17:51,955 --> 01:17:54,922
This can blow
a good-sized hole in a man.

830
01:18:00,285 --> 01:18:03,590
It's by far
the best method of home defense.

831
01:18:06,394 --> 01:18:08,255
Best kept by your bed.

832
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:10,140
Loaded.

833
01:18:12,671 --> 01:18:14,520
It is quite primitive.

834
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:18,690
And this...

835
01:18:21,585 --> 01:18:23,530
This is innovation.

836
01:18:26,296 --> 01:18:29,360
You don't even have to be
anywhere near your target.

837
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:33,040
I mean all you have to do is press
this little button and boom!

838
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:43,050
There're a hundred ways
to kill a man.

839
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:47,510
But by remote
just kinda takes all the fun out of it.

840
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,100
Do you want to live?

841
01:18:56,504 --> 01:18:57,290
Yes.

842
01:18:58,017 --> 01:18:58,755
Good.

843
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,720
Just keep me happy.

844
01:19:05,382 --> 01:19:09,190
Well, I've had just about
enough excitement for one night.

845
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,000
Let's go to bed.

846
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:31,973
I hate it when we fight.

847
01:19:32,713 --> 01:19:35,890
- I don't want to fight with you.
- I don't want to fight with you.

848
01:19:36,325 --> 01:19:39,780
Well, will you promise
never to hurt me again?

849
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:42,190
I promise.

850
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:49,630
- Thank you.
- For what?

851
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:54,090
For making me happy for
the first time in my life.

852
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:56,850
For loving me.

853
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:01,310
I have a surprise for you.

854
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:09,080
You know, that's a good idea.

855
01:20:38,907 --> 01:20:42,090
- You almost ready in there?
- Just a sec.

856
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:56,409
Oh! Zack. I think we should...

857
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:12,450
What did you go and do that for?

858
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:49,283
I lied.

859
01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:54,727
I would've never hurt you.

860
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,840
Hello.

861
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:34,370
Yeah, my name is Zack Butterfield.

862
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:37,700
I'm 15. You guys are looking for me.

863
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:40,920
Yeah.

864
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:44,870
