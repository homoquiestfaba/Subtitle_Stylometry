00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,550
[music continues]

3
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,810
[Meg] found some.

4
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,130
- Thanks.
- When's your appointment?

5
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,200
Uh, not until 12 o'clock.

6
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,870
Oh! You've got a few minutes.

7
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,490
You're sure you don't want me
coming with you?

8
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,320
Don't worry about it.

9
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,230
I don't have to meet
my next client until 2:15.

10
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,840
It's okay. Mike said
he would try to make it.

11
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,590
Okay, so where is he?

12
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,650
Have you even told him, bren?

13
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,180
He said he would try
to make it, Meg.

14
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,270
Okay.

15
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,670
I should probably get going.

16
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,520
Are you sure
you don't want me there?

17
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,760
I'm sure.

18
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,780
It's probably just
a follow-up appointment anyway.

19
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,620
Right.

20
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,450
[instrumental music]

21
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,750
[Dr. Boyer] Ms. Lee?

22
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,370
Brenda?

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,950
I know this prognosis can seem
daunting to say the least.

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,550
There are resources here
at the hospital available to you

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,470
Throughout treatment.

26
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,460
Now aside from
the breast cancer diagnosis,

27
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,290
You also carry
the brca1 gene mutation,

28
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,560
Which could be passed down
to any children

29
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,970
Should you have any.

30
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,230
So if you do, let them know

31
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,900
So they can be tested
as soon as possible.

32
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,910
How...

33
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,890
How long?

34
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,670
[Dr. Boyer] this is not
a guarantee,

35
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,580
But based upon cases
I've seen similar to yours,

36
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,900
If you were to do nothing,
the odds of you surviving this

37
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,340
Are slim.

38
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,340
Nine months.

39
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,240
Maybe ten.

40
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,920
This is
an aggressive form of cancer,

41
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,260
And what I recommend
as soon as possible is surgery,

42
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,850
Chemo and radiation.

43
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,870

44
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,170
Oh, shoot.

45
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,630
Are you just now
returning from lunch?

46
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,036
I'm sorry, my appointments took
longer than I thought they wo...

47
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,856
That's the second time this week
you've had an appointment

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,356
Take longer
than you thought it would.

49
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,380
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'll-I'll make up the-the time.

50
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,570
Yes, you will.

Bren, what happened?

66
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,080
[Meg]<i> are you okay?</i>

67
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,670
[sobbing] no.

68
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,590
Is it...

[sobbing]

70
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,820
Yes.

71
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,430
- I'm coming over.
- No. No, no, I'm fine.

72
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,160
No, you're not fine.

73
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,510
[Brenda]<i> I am, I really...</i>
<i>I'm okay.</i>

74
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,230
[sniffles] mike's here.

75
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,400
How'd he take it?

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,100
[sobbing]

77
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,190
Hey. Hey. It'll be all right.

78
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,700
We're gonna get through this,
okay? Okay, bren?

79
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,530
[sobbing]
okay.

80
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,540
And listen,
I-I don't care what time it is,

81
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,470
If you ever need anything,
you let me know, yeah?

82
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,450
[breathing heavily]

83
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,390
Meg, there...

84
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,050
There is something I need

85
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,550
To a... Ask you for.

86
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,710
Of course. What is it?

87
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,150
[Brenda]<i> I need you</i>
<i>to help me find someone.</i>

88
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,230
Who?

89
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,830
[groans]

[groans] these overnight shifts
are killing me.

94
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,350
[sighs] maybe a cushy
office job like yours

95
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,780
Would be better on my back.

96
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,360
Well, sitting all day
isn't good for you, either.

97
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,880
Yeah? Well, neither is standing.

98
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,040
How did your, um, thing
go yesterday?

99
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,720
Uh, the dentist appointment?

100
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,230
It was a doctor's appointment.

101
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,360
- [sighs] right. How'd that go?
- [cell phone chimes]

102
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,390
I have to get ready for work.

[instrumental music]

104

Hey. Hey, guys.

[exhales sharply]

[thuds]

109
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,170
Not gonna get any views
if you don't have

110
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,280
Anything to say, Talia.

111
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,010
Great!
Thanks for the insight, Tobias.

112
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,350
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

113
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,130
[exhales sharply]

114
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,360
Talia, remind me again
why you dated Tobias?

115
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,930
I think most everyone here
would agree

116
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,300
That drywall has
a more interesting personality.

117
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,290
You'll never let me
live that down, will you?

118
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,380
- Sorry, no.
- We had a lot in common.

119
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,370
And then he stole your idea.

120
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,346
I mean, do the editors
really think an in-depth piece

121
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,060
About body positivity
came from that brain?

122
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,380
- Look at him.
- [Tobias laughing]

123
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,026
Did you see how many hits
it's gotten so far?

124
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,710
Mm, don't remind me.

125
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,300
The worst part is
all the big bosses

126
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Have been singing his praises
ever since.

127
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,680
Whatever weird alternate
dimension we're in, I want out.

128
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,810
[sighs] look, I just need to
come up with a concept he can't

129
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,220
Steal, then everyone will see
him for what he really is.

130
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,170
A trust-fund baby
with major daddy issues

131
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,730
And an obsession
with obnoxiously printed shirts?

132
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,010
- A fraud, Morgan.
- Right. That, too.

133
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,056
Look, he's gonna get
what's coming to him, okay?

134
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,970
I'm a big believer in karma.

135

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,050
You know, we should be kind
to ourselves right now.

140
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
[exhales sharply]

141
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,710
Okay.

[laptop chimes]

146
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,420
- Oh, come on!

148
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,510
Hey.

149
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,060
Can I help you?

150
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,520
- Talia Carroll?
- Yeah.

151
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,450
I'm... Brenda lee.

152
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,870
Your birth mother.

153
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,460
Uh, uh...

154
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,290
Can we talk inside?

155
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,520
How did you find me?

156
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,950
My friend, she, she helped me.
She's a social worker.

157
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,090
I-I-I found you months ago,
but I...

158
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,460
I-I-I have something important
to tell you.

159
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,290
Can, can we talk inside?

160
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,460
Why would I let you
inside my home?

161
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,440
I don't even know who you are.

162
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,390
Wait! Talia, please.

163
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,900
[sighs]
what?

164
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
[Talia sighs]

165
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,430
[instrumental music]

166
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,470
Five minutes.

167
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,820
[Talia] triple-negative.
Never even heard of that.

168
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,260
[Brenda] me neither.

169
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,040
Apparently, it's not very good.

170
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,880
Well, I mean,
no cancer is, but...

171
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,670
You know what I mean.

172
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,880
So what's your plan?

173
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,460
- Plan?
- Yeah, like, what now?

174
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,960
Chemo? Radiation? Herbal teas?

175
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,040
Uh, well, uh,

176
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,470
Possibly a-a mastectomy.

177
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,560
Why possibly?

178
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,230
Well, my doctor and I
are discussing all the options.

179
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,810
What other options are there?

180
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,910
Well, that's pretty much
the only one at the moment.

181
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,140
Seems pretty simple then,
either get the surgery or don't.

182
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,070
Well, there are a lot
of moving parts to this.

183
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,740
But you're getting it done,
right?

184
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,980
Yeah.

185
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,430
Definitely. Yeah.

186
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,230
So...

187
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,850
So, um, the reason that I'm here

188
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,760
Is because, uh, the, um,

189
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,170
Gene mutation that I have,
the one that causes the cancer,

190
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,120
It could possibly be...

191
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,770
Hereditary.

192
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,360
And I, I thought
I should let you know,

193
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,940
So that you could get yourself
checked out.

194
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,110
- [sighs]
- I thought it was...

195
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,040
I-I thought it was a good idea
to tell you in person.

196
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,450
Okay, well, thanks for going
through all this trouble

197
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,710
To find me just to tell me
that I could have cancer.

198
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,890
Thanks a lot.

199
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:59,970
I'm sorry.

200
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,640
[sighs]

201
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,230
[sighs] no, I'm sorry.

202
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,230
This is a little much,
I mean, it's not exactly

203
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,220
How I pictured
our first meeting.

204
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,990
Tell me about it.

205
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,830
[cell phone ringing]

206
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,410
I gotta go grab that real quick.

207
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,130
Um, make yourself at home,
I guess.

208
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,810
[line ringing]

209
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,670
- [Talia on phone]<i> hey, mom!</i>
- Tal.

210
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,360
Okay, where are you? Is the
traffic really bad or something?

211
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,180
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.
I totally blanked about dinner.

212
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,920
[Diana on phone]<i> that seems</i>
<i>a little odd, concerning</i>

213
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,180
<i>We texted about it this morning.</i>

214
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,760
[Talia] I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

215
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,180
I got distracted by work.

216
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,040
Um, a new feature I'm writing.

217
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,166
Okay, well, you know what,
I'm gonna wrap you up a plate.

218
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,540
- And I can be there in 30.
- No!

219
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,210
I mean, ha-ha, that deli
where you accidentally

220
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,620
Knocked the waitress over
is just up the street.

221
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,030
I'll go grab something from
there, unless you wanna join me.

222
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,440
[Diana]<i> oh, my god, no, that's</i>
<i>the last thing I wanna do.</i>

223
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,676
<i>I'm never going back there
again,</i>

224
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,550
<i>That was so embarrassing.</i>

225
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,630
<i>- I was absolutely mortified.</i>
- Me, too.

226
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,780
[Diana]<i> knocking over all those</i>
<i>plates, that poor girl.</i>

227
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,640
Uh, yeah, sorry, mom.
I-I gotta go.

228
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,560
- [line disconnects]
- Tal?

229
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,460
Hang on one sec.

230
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,070
- Sorry about that.
- I should really get going.

231
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,320
Uh, thank you so much
for letting me inside.

232
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,080
You have a lovely home.

233
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,730
Can't take all the credit.
Well, my parents helped.

234
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,160
They insisted, there's no way
I could afford this

235
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,090
On my peasant salary.

236
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,590
That's good to know.

237
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,910
Wait. Wait.

238
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,600
So, do you wanna, maybe,
exchange numbers or something?

239
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,430
Oh. Sure. Okay.

240
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,850
Okay. Great.

241
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,940
Um, give me your phone
and I'll-I'll put myself in.

242
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,610
Oh, um...

243
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,450
- There.
- [cell phone keys clacking]

244
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,100
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

245
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,440
I don't really know how to say
this without sounding weird,

246
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,250
But how much time
do you have left?

247
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,700
Oh.

248
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,850
Uh, well...

249
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,300
I, uh, don't really know.

250
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,610
Your doctor couldn't give you
a time frame or anything?

251
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:41,970
[Talia sighs]

252
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,140
I can't imagine
how that must feel.

253
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,290
So what are you gonna do?

254
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,370
What's your plan
outside of treatment?

255
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,150
W-well, the last three months
was just about

256
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,210
Building up the courage
to come knocking on your door

257
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,140
Once I found you.

258
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,400
But now that that's done, I...

259
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,240
I don't know.

260
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,220
What else is there?

261
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,580
Well, why don't we start
with dinner tomorrow?

262
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,230
You wanna go to dinner, with me?

263
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,080
Yeah. I mean,
unless you're busy or something.

264
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,670
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

265
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:25,070
- I-I mean, no, I-I'm not busy.
- Oh, okay, great.

266
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,500
Whe-where do you wanna go?

267
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,520
Uh, I usually grab a-a-a burger

268
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,260
At, at burger hut
or-or-or a sandwich at Gerry's.

269
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,020
- Those are good and fast.
- Okay, those are options.

270
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,360
But what about something
different? Something new?

271
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,990
Like, what?

272
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,850
Chez marcel's? It's a nicer
place, on Johnson street.

273
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,280
Do you know it?
Tomorrow, six-ish?

274
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,190
- Why not?
- Okay.

275
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,960
- See you tomorrow then. Okay.
- Okay.

276
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,050
[sighs]

277
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,710
[Morgan]<i> so what's she like,</i>
<i>this shiny new mom of yours?</i>

278
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,300
She seems... Reserved.

279
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,140
A little uneasy. But I mean,
I was feeling the same way, too.

280
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,140
It's just so weird,
seeing her in the flesh,

281
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,290
Standing in front of me.

282
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,790
And it makes perfect sense.

283
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,310
This is kind of major
for both of you.

284
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,570
Totally. You know, it's funny.

285
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,490
When I asked her what her plan
was for the whole cancer thing,

286
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,320
She didn't seem to have one,
she said she wanted to find me

287
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,140
To tell me about the gene,
and that was it.

288
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,980
So she's got nothing?
No back-up plan?

289
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,480
- No trick plays?
- Nope.

290
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,830
- No hail Marys?
- Nada.

291
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,720
Like, not even a bucket list.

292
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,090
[gasps]

293
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,550
Talia Carroll, there it is.

294
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,670
There what is?

295
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:55,660
The article that's gonna kick
Tobias' idea-stealing ass

296
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,090
Three ways from Sunday.

297
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,920
A breast-cancer bucket list.

298
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,520
I don't know, Morgan. Doesn't
that seem a little exploitative?

299
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,430
- No.
- Okay, maybe not to you.

300
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,430
But to, like,
to a normal person.

301
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,120
[scoffs] uh, Tal, listen,
readers know a heartfelt story

302
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,770
When they read it,
and what I'm seeing

303
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,280
Is a young woman reconnecting
with her dying birth mother,

304
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,690
Helping her live the rest
of her life to the fullest.

305
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,880
Someone give this woman
her Pulitzer, stat!

306
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,710
[sighs]

307
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,290
It just seems in bad taste.

308
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,120
But this is your story, from
your perspective, no one else's.

309
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,700
How-how is that in bad taste?

310
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,310
You are not gonna mess this up.

311
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,320
Tal, this is it.
This is your story.

312
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,580
[indistinct chatter]

313
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,840
Do you have a reservation?

314
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,320
Uh, um, yeah.

315
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,090
I-I think for two,

316
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,160
Under Talia Carroll.

317
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,270
There. Gotcha. Right this way.

318
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,530
[cell phone vibrating]

319
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,380
[exhales sharply]
Brenda! Hey!

320
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,950
- Hi.
- Hey.

321
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,640
- Oh?
- [Talia chuckles]

322
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,720
Sorry I'm late. Work is nuts.

323
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,310
- No, don't worry about it.
- [Talia chuckles]

324
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,740
So excited!

325
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,820
- How's it goin'?
- Good.

326
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,890
I will give you two a few
minutes to look over the menu.

327
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,900
- Um, are you ready?
- Uh, uh, sure.

328
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,640
Okay, um, I will start
with a Caesar salad,

329
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,230
Then I'll have the steak,
medium rare,

330
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,660
With roasted potatoes
on the side.

331
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,500
Excellent choice. How about you?

332
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,920
Uh, uh, the house salad, please.

333
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,556
- All right.
- What? No, no, no, Brenda.

334
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,580
- Order whatever you want.
- Are you sure?

335
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:38,170
Yes! Look, if you want the 32
ounce porterhouse, go for it.

336
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,350
[chuckles] um...

337
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,250
I'll just have
what she's having.

338
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,830
Sounds good. It'll be right out.

339
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,030
Thank you.

340
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,190
Mm...

341
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,430
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

342
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,600
So who do you have
supporting you during all this?

343
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,780
A partner, siblings,
other family?

344
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,200
Well, there's my friend, Meg.

345
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,710
Uh, she and I have
known each other forever.

346
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,300
It's nice to have someone
in your life like that.

347
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,530
- Mm-hmm.
- Where'd you guys meet?

348
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,450
At school.

349
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,960
Uh, she was studying
to be a social worker

350
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,810
And, um, and I was taking
art history.

351
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,810
We met up
in a liberal arts class.

352
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,980
We just hit it off.

353
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,710
Twenty years later,
she's working for the state

354
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:37,120
And I'm, uh, in data entry.

355
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,220
Is Meg all you have?

356
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,980
Well, there's mike, but...

357
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,820
Is mike your husband?

358
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,250
Uh, no. No, no, no. Uh...

359
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,670
We've been together
for a long time, but...

360
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,390
I don't wanna bore you
with the details.

361
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,000
No. No, you're not
boring me at all.

362
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,090
I mean, I wanna hear everything.

363
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,580
I wanna know about you, I wanna
know about my, um, your family.

364
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Like, were you born here? Have
you always lived in the city?

365
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,530
I immigrated with my parents
from Beijing

366
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,270
About 35 years ago,

367
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,370
And I've never really lived
anywhere else.

368
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,200
I've never really traveled
anywhere else either.

369
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,450
Um, are your parents

370
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,330
Still around?

371
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,050
They passed away when I was 11.

372
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,220
[instrumental music]

373
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,470
I'm so sorry. Hav...

374
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,060
Did you have someone
to take care of you after that?

375
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,230
Just myself.

376
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,880
My...

377
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,530
I was in foster care
until I was 18.

378
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,820
Start you two off
with some bread.

379
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,820
Main courses will be right out.

380
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,080
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

381
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,170
Is my dad around?

382
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,910
His family

383
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:21,000
Wouldn't let him get involved.

384
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,510
They said that, uh,
having a child out of wedlock

385
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,940
Would be a stain
on their family's reputation.

386
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:33,730
So he had to choose
either them or me.

387
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,010
I was young and terrified

388
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,450
And... All alone.

389
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,360
I didn't wanna drag you
into all of that,

390
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,790
So I, I did what I thought
was best for both of us.

391
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,880
Was it?

392
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,300
I've been really lucky.

393
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,290
Um, I love my job,
I may even be able to pay off

394
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,030
My student loans
in the next 40 years or so.

395
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,460
- [laughs]
- w-w-what do you do?

396
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,960
Um, I work at repeat media.

397
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,540
It's a website that covers
news and culture.

398
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,540
- I'm a writer.
- Oh, a writer?

399
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,650
- Well, that sounds fun.
- Yeah. It is.

400
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,230
Um, I work
in the lifestyle department,

401
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,640
So I get to tackle articles
on political issues

402
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,810
And city issues
and feminist issues.

403
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,150
I've got a lot of issues,
apparently.

404
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,660
[both chuckling]

405
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:38,250
And, uh, your parents...

406
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,010
Are they good to you?

407
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,470
Yeah.

408
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,420
They're really good people.

409
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:51,410
They adopted me when I was
only a few months old.

410
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,170
I never felt like
I wasn't their daughter.

411
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,270
Let me show you.

412
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,110
Okay.

413
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,010
[both chuckling]

414
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,270
[Talia]
we were being kinda silly.

415
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,430
Yeah.

416
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:16,130
How did they tell you about
the whole adoption thing?

417
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,610
Um...

418
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,460
They were always
pretty open about it.

419
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,366
If I ever asked a question,
they would answer as honestly

420
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,070
As they could,
plus, it was kind of obvious

421
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,370
That I was adopted. I mean,
we don't exactly look alike.

422
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,800
[laughing] so...

423
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:36,120
All right.
Two steaks, medium rare.

424
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,730
Can I get you ladies
anything else?

425
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,730
Um, I think we're good.
Thank you.

426
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,190
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

427
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,220
That's all you get
for all that money?

428
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,390
It's no wonder
I've never eaten here.

429
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,410
[Talia chuckles]

430
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,970
[Talia] so yesterday
you mentioned not having

431
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,490
Much of a plan during all this.

432
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,980
Is there anything that
you've always wanted to try,

433
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,330
But have never been able to do?

434
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,410
Like, like skydiving

435
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,570
Or dog-sledding
or bungee jumping?

436
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,090
Things like that?

437
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,550
Uh, no, I've never really
thought about it.

438
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:18,160
What do you think
about... A bucket list?

439
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,330
Excuse me?

440
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,420
Haven't you always wanted to

441
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,090
Make one, to do all the things

442
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,236
That you've always wanted to do,

443
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,340
But were too afraid to try?

444
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,850
[chuckles] I, I don't know.

445
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,760
Yes! It'll be fun, I promise.

446
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:32,190
I-I could help you.
I mean, we could do it together.

447
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,360
I-I don't want to interfere
more than I already...

448
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,020
No, no, you're not interfering,
you're not interfering.

449
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,020
Um, okay,
what is the one thing in life

450
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,630
That you've always wanted to do,
but have never had the chance?

451
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,690
[Brenda] uh, uh...

452
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,590
I don't know, maybe, um...

453
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,710
Uh, not have to worry
about money.

454
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:56,980
Okay, um, number one,
withdraw my savings account.

455
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,480
- [both laughing]
- I don't know about that.

456
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,630
I mean, go big or go home,
right?

457
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,300
Well, if I spend all my money,
I wouldn't have a home.

458
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,210
- Oh. Sorry.
- [chuckles] that's okay.

459
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,400
Okay. Number two?

460
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,400
Uh, uh, I guess, quit my job?

461
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,160
Yes! Quit my job with a bang.

462
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,560
Number three?

463
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,840
Uh, uh,
eat at a fancy restaurant.

464
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,230
[Talia] just like that,
you already accomplished

465
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,730
One item off your list.

466
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,580
Uh, four?

467
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,240
See every exhibit at the Louvre.

468
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,000
[Talia]<i> oui!</i> Amazing.

469
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,850
Oh, number five,
kick mike to the curb.

470
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,170
[Talia] uh,<i> adios,</i> mike.

471
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,840
[both laughing]

472
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,260
Um, number six?

473
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,110
Get back in the water.

474
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,280
- [Talia] number seven?
- [waves gurgling]

475
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,790
Brenda?

476
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,170
Brenda?

477
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,210
Are you okay?

478
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,220
Yeah.

479
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,890
We can just
pick this up again later.

480
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,570
Here we are.

481
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,460
[Talia] here we are.

482
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,630
Um, where are you parked?

483
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,390
- Oh, that's me right there.
- Oh! Okay.

484
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,650
- [both chuckling]
- and you?

485
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,580
- I'm right there.
- Oh! Okay.

486
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,070
- Okay.
- [both chuckling]

487
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,730
[Brenda] um, could I ask you
a favor?

488
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,750
Sure.

489
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,090
Do you think maybe

490
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,740
You could help me
add to that list?

491
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,260
I don't think
I could do this alone.

492
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,170
I would love that.
Um, I'll text you in a few days.

493
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,420
- And maybe we can meet up then?
- Okay. That'd be great.

494
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,850
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

495
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,830
- Uh, drive safe.
- [Talia] you, too.

496
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,090
- Okay. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

497
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,170
[Brenda] okay.

498
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,610
- Bye!
- Bye!

499
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,530
[instrumental music]

500
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,200
[door opens, shuts]

501
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,880
Hey, Ben,
those financials by 9:00.

502
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,870
- Hey, Brenda.
- Hi.

503
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:48,060
It's getting late, just checking
in, seeing how things are going.

504
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,980
Uh, good. They're,
they're, they're going great.

505
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,440
Thank you.

506
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,400
Is there a reason
why these intake forms

507
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,490
Haven't been processed yet?

508
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,330
Some of these are two weeks old.

509
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,850
I, um...

510
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:22,090
[breathing heavily]

511
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,910
I... Kevin, I have
something to tell you.

512
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:28,480
I, uh,
I wanted to tell you that I...

513
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,360
That, um...

514
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,110
[cell phone chimes]

515
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,370
What is it, Brenda?

516
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,330
I'll get on these right away.

517
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,300
[whispers] I'm sorry.

518
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,550
I'm sorry.

519
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,890

520
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,140
[indistinct chatter on TV]

00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,810
[Marty laughs]

[indistinct chatter on TV]

524
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,240
- Okay. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

Yes.

- Something important?
- Nope, just work.

531

You seem to be really busy
with work lately.

532
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,730
Uh, yeah,
I've had some tight deadlines.

533
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,610
I kinda miss you.

534

I know. I'm sorry.

I will be here all the time.

Okay, are you wearing
those glasses that I got you

538

So that the computer light
thing doesn't...

539
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,630
- The blue-light glasses, yes.
- [Diana] yes.

540

- [Diana] excellent.

- Hm?

Did you know my birth mom?

544

Um, well, I never met her,

If that's what
you're asking, uh...

546
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,330
From what I remember,
she was young

547
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,480
And didn't really have
a support system.

548
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:53,500
Giving you up must've been the
hardest decision of her life.

549
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,670
Right.

550
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,400

Yes. Yeah.

I mean,
I know that it can be tough.

553
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,930
But you can always talk to me
about anything.

554
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,670
I know. Thanks, mom.

[Talia] wait, which one is it?

567
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,590
- It's the one with the big tree.
- Big...

568

569

Then we shall wait.

- [chuckles] oh, sorry.
- You first.

572
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,680
Um, I was just gonna ask
if you've done

Anything else in your list.

with work, so...

Where do you work, again?

Uh, Dunshire capital.

577
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:48,780
They deal with, uh,
risk management and compliance.

578
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,120
Sounds riveting.
No wonder you wanna quit.

we spoke, but...

583
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,190
I mean, have they scheduled
your surgery yet?

584
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,040
You'd think
it'd be high priority.

585
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,790
- You'd think so.
- Did you try calling again?

586
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,550
Or speaking to your doctor?
I mean...

587
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,460
Well, I, I don't really know
how that kind of stuff works.

588
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,370
- Talia.
- Why don't you let me do it?

589
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,130
I-I can figure this out
really quick

590
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,480
Or get in there and I'll just,
like, see what's going...

- I get it.
- You do?

609
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,860
Yeah, I told my ex-boyfriend
about this idea,

610
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,040
And then he stole it from me.

said something, right?

00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,860
If you weren't so selfish,
so stubborn, so bull-headed!

698
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,370
If I would've known
about this earlier,

699
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,200
This would all be different.

700
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,280
You know what? You're right.

701
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,450
This is all your fault. Yeah.

702
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,370
You might've made me
go and get tested

703
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,860
And the doctors
might've found it sooner.

704
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,030
Maybe early enough
to save my life, even.

705
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:49,220
But I still
wouldn't have been happy.

706
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,290
And I haven't been happy, mike.

707
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:55,300
I haven't been happy
for a very long time.

708
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,380
And I would've been stuck
in this one-way relationship,

709
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:01,470
At this dead-end job,
paying for this house,

710
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,490
Because you keep getting fired
from every single job!

711
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:10,070
And I would have continued
living exactly as I always have,

712
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,570
Without purpose!

713
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:14,480
But not anymore.

714
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,650
Not with so little time left.

715
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:21,160
Bren, wait. Wait, just, just,
just, stop, stop, stop!

716
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,420
Be rational for a minute, bren!

717
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,180
No! You stop!

718
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,520
I am being rational.

719
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,020
I have never thought
more clearly

720
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,650
In my entire life.

721
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,420
Oh.

722
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,110
- [sighs]
- [door shuts]

723
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,490
[instrumental music]

724
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,060
[music continues]

725
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,740
[doorbell ringing]

726
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:40,000
[music continues]

727
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,250
- [knocking]
- can I come in?

728
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,890
Yeah. Come on in, Brenda.
Have a seat.

729
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,510
I'm glad you came by, actually.

730
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,500
I've been looking
over your personnel records

731
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,020
For the last several years that
you've been with the company.

732
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:08,340
And during that time, you have
hardly taken any sick days,

733
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,020
Your work's never been late

734
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,360
And you've always been prompt.

735
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:15,410
That was up until
a few months ago.

736
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,130
So tell me, Brenda,
what's changed?

737
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,420
[birds chirping]

738
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:34,470
The world will keep on spinning
long after I'm gone.

739
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,140
Excuse me?

740
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,480
A lot has changed, Kevin.

741
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,230
I realized
in the last couple of months

742
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,780
That I need to be
more proactive in my life...

743
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,230
I need to make changes,

744
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:55,740
And that I have the capacity

745
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:59,060
To make those changes.

746
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:02,500
Life is just
a bunch of little moments

747
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,670
All wrapped up together.

748
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,930
And when I look back at those
moments for the last time...

749
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,520
I don't wanna think about
all the time that I wasted here.

750
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,190
I'm sorry?

751
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,810
Thanks for everything, Kevin.

752
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:26,650
I quit.

753
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:38,690
You know, you're really
not all that bad of a guy.

754
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:39,906
We probably
could've been friends

755
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,870
If you weren't such a jerk.

756
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,170
Oh. And, uh, sorry about the tp.

757
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,450
Wait. The tp?

758
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,540
[Brenda] an-and-and I just
walked right out of there.

759
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,380
I didn't even look back.
It was like

760
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:03,040
This wave of energy
washed over me,

761
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,970
And-and I just felt so, well,

762
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,720
For lack of a better word,
alive!

763
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,290
[laughs]

764
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,300
Are you sure
that was a right decision?

765
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:14,570
Oh, I have enough savings
to last me for a while.

766
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,300
Wow! Ha-ha.

767
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,410
That does not sound like
something you would say.

768
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,400
The Brenda I know
is work, work, work, no play.

769
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,980
Well, maybe this is
the new Brenda.

770
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:31,070
You know, I, ever since
I found Talia, I just,

771
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:33,500
I see things
from a different perspective.

772
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:35,840
- How's that going?
- Oh. Mm!

773
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:40,270
It's going amazing, Meg.

774
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:42,830
Yeah, and we-we started
this bucket list,

775
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,100
And ever since then every day
is getting better and better.

776
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,170
I'm doing things that
I never thought I would before.

777
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,610
And some of the things
I do by myself,

778
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,170
But most of the things
I ask her to come with me.

779
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:57,070
And it just feels so right.

780
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:00,870
Bren, you know I love you.

781
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,610
You know
I'd do anything for you.

782
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:08,850
But this whole thing with Talia,

783
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:11,350
I mean, don't you think
it's too much too soon?

784
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,690
- What do you mean?
- Well, look.

785
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:16,950
You just came into her life,
which is great.

786
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:20,970
You're spending all this time
together, which is also great.

787
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,440
But think about it, bren,
what's going to happen when...

788
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:29,220
If you're gone?

789
00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:31,320
She's lost you once before.

790
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,990
How do you think she'll handle
losing you again?

791
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:43,830
That's why I decided
to get the treatment.

792
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,330
What?

793
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,410
I called Dr. Boyer
and we are planning it

794
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,670
As soon as possible.

795
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,080
And was this all
because of Talia?

796
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:56,420
I realized
I have something to live for.

797
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:59,250
[indistinct singing]

798
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,160
Come here! Come here!

799
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,660

800
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,260
Okay, okay, okay, okay! Okay.

- Oh, jeez, okay.
<i>- Todo.</i>

806
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,200
- Mm!
- Ah!

807
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,566
- [indistinct chatter]
- oh, yeah.

808
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:21,030
- [laughing]
- okay, okay.

809

[cell phone vibrating]

- Hey, dad.
- [Marty on phone]<i> hey, kiddo.</i>

812
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,610
<i>Just calling to see if you can
make supper tonight.</i>

813
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:39,220
Sorry, no. I've got some
major deadlines I need to hit.

814
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,700
[sighs] who knew
writing personal essays

815
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,700
Could be so stressful?

816
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,560
Hey, um, listen.

817
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,120
Is everything good with you
these days?

818
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,686
<i>- Yeah. Why are you asking?</i>
- [Marty]<i> well...</i>

819
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:49,880
<i>Don't tell her I said anything,
but your mom</i>

820
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,710
<i>Is pretty worried about you.</i>

821
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:53,856
Like, normal, you know,
you haven't made a family dinner

822
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,310
In months,
you're working all the time.

823
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,630
<i>You don't even come by
to steal toilet paper anymore.</i>

824
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,150
[Talia] I am running low,
now that you mention it.

825
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,890
[Marty]<i> we got plenty. Just...</i>
[Talia] um, I gotta go.

826
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,320
But I promise I will make this
up to the both of you.

827
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,230
Next week. Pizza. My treat.

828
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,490
Okay, but seriously,
call your mother.

829
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:14,810
All right? And, uh,
looking forward to pizza.

830
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,780
- [Marty]<i> talk soon, sweetie.</i>
- Okay. Goodnight.

831
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,760
[clears throat]

832
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,170
Hey!

833
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,600
I thought we would try

834
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,270
Something special.

835
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,330
Oh, making!

836
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,350
- It's a surprise!
- Okay.

837
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,270
[instrumental music]

838
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,360
The<i> jiaozi</i> fen,
the dumpling flour makes it

839
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:49,790
So that the dough doesn't stick.

840
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,020
Mm.<i> Jiaozi fen.</i>

841
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:55,190
<i>- Jiaozi fen.
- Jiaozi fen.</i>

842
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,630
- [laughs] perfect.
- [Talia chuckles]

843
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,880
- Okay. All right!
- Okay.

844
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:04,360
Teach me how to do this.

845
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,710
- Okay. So you take the dough.
- Okay.

846
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:12,390
And then I press it in my palms,

847
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,210
Make it flat. There we go, okay.

848
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,650
And then I hold it
with my left hand,

849
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:22,060
And with the right hand
I'm gonna roll the pin

850
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,970
Like that, okay?

851
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:26,490
- You got this?
- I got... Yes.

852
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,980
- Okay. You try.
- Okay.

853
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,490
- Okay!
- There we go.

854
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,410
[mumbles]

855
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:34,620
Okay...

856
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:40,560
If I turn it in.
Okay, I got this.

857
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,900
I can... I don't know
how I'm gonna work this.

858
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,250
- Okay. I don't got this.
- [both laughing]

859
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,000
Okay, here,
let me help you salvage this.

860
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:52,680
So just, there we go, put some
pressure on the edges like that.

861
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:54,340
- Okay. Okay.
- Just push a little harder.

862
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:56,930
- Okay. Here we go.
- [cell phone vibrating]

[Talia grunting]

864
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,860
[Brenda] okay,
maybe not so hard.

865
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,680
- [Talia] that's so ugly!
- [Brenda laughing]

866
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,270
- I'm just gonna let you do it.
- [laughing]

867
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,270
- Look, I can salvage this.
- Yes.

868
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:10,610
- Just...
- There we go. Okay.

869
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,336
- [Brenda] I got it. I got this.
- [cell phone vibrating]

870
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,280
There we go.

871
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:15,710
- [chuckling]
- well...

872
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,880
Where'd you learn
how to make these?

873
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:21,460
I used to do this every
Chinese new year with my mother.

874
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,370
Yeah, she always complained
that I stuffed it

875
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:28,110
With too much filling.

876
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,930
Uh, there's no such thing
as too much filling.

877
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,390
- Oh. Exactly.
- [laughs]

878
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:38,640
Gosh, I haven't done this
in forever.

879
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:42,380
But it's like riding a bike,
you know, you never forget.

880
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,650
[Talia] when was the last time?

881
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,530
Not since she died.

882
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:54,000
Then I tried to do it
after the fact, but...

883
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:57,750
It was just too much.
I couldn't do it.

884
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:02,840
That must've been hard,
losing them both.

885
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:11,430
How did it happen?

886
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,100
[instrumental music]

887
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:28,260
We used to go boating

888
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,950
Every summer on sterling lake.

889
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:36,600
[Brenda]<i> and when we'd get</i>
<i>to the point</i>

890
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:40,870
Where we couldn't see land
anymore...

891
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,540
My father would cut the engine

892
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:47,690
And drop the anchor

893
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:50,640
<i>And just let us drift.</i>

894
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,620
I still remember,
on windier days,

895
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,430
The boat would rock...

896
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:01,600
<i>And it was so easy to just...</i>

897
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,070
Fall asleep.

898
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:10,990
On that day...

899
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:17,120
I decided to go into the water
while my parents were resting.

900
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,840
And I got far way
from the boat...

901
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,010
When I heard the engine...

902
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:33,850
From the other boat.

903
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:40,190
And I turned around just
in time to see the impact...

904
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,190
[crashing]

905
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:44,360
[breathing heavily]

906
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:53,820
- [sobbing]
- are you okay?

907
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:57,280
I just...

908
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,160
I lost my breath for a second.

909
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,960
[Brenda sobbing]

910
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,280
[sniffles]

911
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,390
I'm sorry you had
to go through that alone...

912
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:24,120
And that you grew up
without a family.

913
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:25,310
[sniffles]

914
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,400
I used to think about you a lot.

915
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:35,240
Like, who you were,

916
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:38,200
If I had your eyes
or your smile...

917
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,710
Why you gave me away...

918
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,740
You know, when you first
showed up at my door,

919
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,760
I was anxious.

920
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:55,090
I remember thinking,
like, "why here? Why now?

921
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,160
Why, after 23 years, did you
decide to barge into my life

922
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:00,920
Like you belonged there
from the start?"

923
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:03,010
I mean, I had a great childhood.

924
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,590
I have parents who love me.

925
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:08,500
I didn't think I would ever need
to have you around.

926
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:10,020
But now...

927
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,700
I don't remember what life
was like without you in it.

928
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,940
I am so sorry.

929
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,110
[both sobbing]

930
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:30,350
I've never been more sorry
for anything in my entire life.

931
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:33,300
I know. I know. It's okay.

932
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,780
- [door opens]
- [Diana] hey, Tal?

933
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,860
[Marty] hey, honey, we're here!
[Talia] oh, my god!

934
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,380
Oh, my god! Okay. Okay.

935
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,480
Ah...

936
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,700
Mom! Dad! What are you guys
doing here?

937
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,936
- We brought dinner.
- Are you cooking?

938
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,480
'cause it smells delicious.

939
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:53,300
[instrumental music]

940
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,490
- Who's your friend?
- Um...

941
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,160
Um, let's talk in my room
for a quick sec, yeah?

942
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:02,810
Dad, can you put the food
on the table, please?

943
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:04,830
Sure. Yeah.
Plenty for everybody.

944
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,630
Um...

945
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:14,670
Okay.

946
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:17,470
Mom? Wait.

947
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:31,690
What are you doing here?

948
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:37,420
- I should get going.
- No, no, no, no.

949
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,920
You don't have to go anywhere.
Don't have to go anywhere. Okay?

950
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,870
We, we were just
making dumplings.

951
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,850
Like, what does it matter?

952
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:47,450
What does it matter?

953
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,210
[Diana] I mean, you lied to us.

954
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:51,930
And on top of that,
your birth mother

955
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:54,450
Is standing in your house?

956
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:56,880
Uh, when were you going
to tell us that you found her?

957
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:03,110
Well, she found me.
She's, she's sick.

958
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:04,890
She has cancer.

959
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:12,120
Look, I'm sorry
that you're unwell,

960
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,730
But, um, can you just
please tell me

961
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,900
How the hell
you found my daughter?

962
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:20,740
[Brenda] okay...

963
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,560
My friend,
she's a social worker.

964
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:26,230
Are you kidding?

965
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,990
Oh, wow, that is so reassuring!

966
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,830
You know, maybe you can get me
her name so I can go to her home

967
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,990
And thank her.
I'll just show up unannounced.

968
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:36,900
Better yet, why don't I just
call her supervisor? What do...

969
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,480
Look, nobody needs
to get in trouble here.

970
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,570
Yeah, everybody,
let's just take a minute.

971
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,820
- Let's take a breath...
- I'm not gonna take a breath!

972
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,200
Mom, can you please relax? She
had every right to find me...

973
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,430
- Given the circumstances.
- Uh, you lied!

974
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:48,896
Because I knew
you'd react exactly

975
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,680
How you are right now, okay?

976
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:52,920
Yes, but the article you're
writing, is that a lie, too?

977
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:56,330
No. That,
that wasn't a lie, okay?

978
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:59,670
I have been struggling
ever since Tobias stole my idea.

979
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:02,860
And so when Brenda showed up,
I-I had to explore it.

980
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:04,620
And I've been writing about her,

981
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,430
About the bucket list
her and I created,

982
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:08,600
About how I could have the same

983
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,700
Cancer-causing gene mutation
that she has.

984
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,680
Okay, back up. Gene mutation?
What are you talking about?

985
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,940
- [Brenda] Talia...
- Uh...

986
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,440
All this time we spent together

987
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,470
Was just content
for your article?

988
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:23,210
No. No, no, no. That's not,
that's not what I meant.

989
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,300
- That's...
- [groans]

990
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:28,970
[Talia] Brenda?

991
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:31,390
Are you okay?

992
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:38,320
Brenda?

993
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,060
[Talia] oh, my god! Brenda?

994
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:46,380
Oh, my god. Brenda?
Mom, dad, call 911.

995
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,160
[siren wailing]

996
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:54,500
What is taking so long?
Where is the doctor?

997
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:58,320
Honey, I'm sure
Brenda's gonna be fine, okay?

998
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:00,510
These things,
they just take time.

999
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,320
Talia, you mentioned earlier

1000
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:05,250
Something about the cancer
being...

1001
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,330
- Hereditary.
- Yes.

1002
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:10,000
That's why she came to find me,

1003
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:12,910
To tell me that I could have
the same gene mutation,

1004
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,440
That I should get tested.

1005
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:19,860
And have you?

1006
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:23,100
[sighs] no.

1007
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,750
Oh, Tal.

1008
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:26,590
[Diana]
you have to go get tested.

1009
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:28,870
This isn't something
that you can just flake on

1010
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,260
Or sweep under the rug.
You really have to, like, just...

1011
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,710
Mom! What?
What have I done wrong now?

1012
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:36,180
I'm sorry that I haven't got
tested. I'm sorry that I lied.

1013
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:37,930
I'm sorry that
Brenda's fighting for her life

1014
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:40,380
Somewhere in this building
while we sit here arguing.

1015
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,846
You know, this is taking too
long. I'm gonna find a doctor.

1016
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:45,050
Talia, don't... Just... Hm...

1017
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,140
[indistinct chatter]

1018
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:53,560
[elevator bell dings]

1019
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,220
[Dr. Boyer] likely fainted
due to stress, the toll

1020
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:13,140
That the cancer's taking
on your body.

1021
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:15,750
Were you experiencing
lightheadedness all day?

1022
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,310
[Brenda] it's been on and off
for the last

1023
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:21,900
Couple of weeks now,
but nothing like today.

1024
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
[Dr. Boyer] I see.

1025
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:29,240
So... We ran some tests

1026
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,430
To see where your body's at,
and...

1027
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,250
The cancer is progressing,
Brenda.

1028
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:41,440
We need to act now before
we can't do anything at all.

1029
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,350
How soon?

1030
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:48,530
Tomorrow.

1031
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:56,940
I, I know
things are moving fast,

1032
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:00,530
But if we don't have surgery
or start treatment tomorrow,

1033
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:04,800
It's the difference between
life and death at this point.

1034
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:09,470
You have to try.

1035
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,230
- Okay.
- [Dr. Boyer] good.

1036
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:21,060
- Okay.
- Good.

1037
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,800
Now you rest up.

1038
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:26,650
Tomorrow's gonna be a big day.

1039
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,820
[exhales sharply]

1040
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:45,670
[instrumental music]

1041
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:01,930
[sighs]

1042
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:15,530
[music continues]

1043
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,790
[sighs]

1044
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:33,380
[sobbing]

1045
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:41,480
[exhales sharply]

1046
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:45,900
[breathing heavily]

1047
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:02,750
[sobbing]

1048
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:09,420
Tal, it's okay.

1049
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:15,340
I'm really sorry.

1050
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:18,930
- For what?
- [sobbing]

1051
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:22,270
For not telling you about her...

1052
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,940
And for everything.

1053
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:31,610
Yeah, well, I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

1054
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:36,170
I don't know.

1055
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:38,280
Just when I saw her,
it felt like

1056
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:41,120
She was trying to take you away
from us.

1057
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,290
That would never happen.

1058
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:49,880
You're my mom.

1059
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,800
Mm...

1060
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:01,880
- [sobbing]
- what is it?

1061
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:05,530
I just don't want her
to leave me again.

1062
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:08,550
Like, the way that I feel
when I'm with her, yeah,

1063
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:11,390
It's the same way that I feel
when I'm with you

1064
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:13,400
Or with dad.

1065
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:20,140
You know,

1066
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,900
Nothing is ever
going to change between us

1067
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,150
And how we feel for you.

1068
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,910
No. Hey, kiddo.

1069
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,580
You'll always be our daughter.

1070
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:34,460
Listen, I will always be
your mother and Brenda...

1071
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:39,840
Brenda will always be
your birth mother.

1072
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:44,680
We'll just have to set
an extra plate for the holidays.

1073
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:46,580
Yeah.

1074
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:50,860
I love you, guys. Thank you.

1075
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,320
- Have a good day. Yeah.
- Thank you.

1076
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:58,940
- Good morning!
- [man] hi. How can I help you?

1077
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:00,890
Can I get a pass
to Brenda lee's room, please?

1078
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:03,530
Brenda lee?

1079
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:06,280
- L-e-e?
- Yes, that's correct.

1080
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:09,040
Mm, sorry, but it looks like
that patient

1081
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:10,540
Was released
earlier this morning.

1082
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:13,040
Wait, what?
Are you, are you sure?

1083
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:15,360
Dr, Boyer, did you release
Brenda lee this morning?

1084
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,940
- She released herself.
- But isn't her surgery today?

1085
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,380
- She canceled it.
- Wait, what?

1086
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,630
- She canceled it.
- That doesn't make any sense.

1087
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,110
Why would she do that?

1088
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:26,040
In the short time
that I've known Ms. Lee,

1089
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:29,230
She never said anything more
than she needed to say.

1090
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:32,960
I assumed it was her way
of processing the diagnosis.

1091
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,900
I have seen this
with other patients.

1092
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:37,980
They wait
until the last possible moment,

1093
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:40,240
Thinking they'll be the ones
to cheat fate.

1094
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:41,800
Seldom works out that way.

1095
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:43,470
No, no, but she was saying
that, like...

1096
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,490
I tried to get her to commit.
I really did.

1097
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:50,400
I thought today was the day,
and I thought seeing you here

1098
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:52,990
Would help convince her
that surgery was the right way

1099
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:56,660
Forward, but when I went to her
room this morning to prep,

1100
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,810
She was fully dressed.

1101
01:07:58,830 --> 01:08:01,050
She said she didn't wanna
go through with it.

1102
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:04,840
Why?

1103
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:10,080
She said that she had
nothing left to live for.

1104
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:13,350
[woman on pa]<i> paging Dr. Boyer</i>
<i>to emergency. Dr. Boyer.</i>

1105
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,760
[Dr. Boyer] we are out of
options and we're out of time.

1106
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:19,400
When you see your mother again,
please tell her that.

1107
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:23,700
[instrumental music]

1108
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:48,100
[knocking on door]

1109
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,560
- Hey.
- How are you feeling?

1110
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,770
Better.

1111
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:05,660
You don't have to say that.
You're not better.

1112
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,550
And you're not going to get
any better

1113
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:09,400
Unless you get the surgery.

1114
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,740
I mean it, bren.

1115
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:14,570
Look, nobody asks to be put
in a situation like this.

1116
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:19,580
Nobody wants surgery
or months of chemo,

1117
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:23,080
To lose their hair when
the outcome isn't a guarantee.

1118
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:27,490
But if there is a chance,
even the smallest sliver,

1119
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:30,240
That you could come out alive,
wouldn't you wanna try?

1120
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:33,410
I just don't see the point
anymore, Meg.

1121
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,840
[sobbing] I have nothing left.

1122
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:39,190
Maybe if you hear it
from someone else, then.

1123
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:43,990
[instrumental music]

1124
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:47,850
[sighs]

1125
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:50,700
[music continues]

1126
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,280
Why didn't you tell me
that you were the one

1127
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,050
Putting off your surgery?

1128
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:13,120
This whole time I thought
you had exhausted every option,

1129
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,730
But you hadn't bothered
to do anything?

1130
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:19,790
- H-how did you know that?
- I was at the hospital.

1131
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,526
I stood outside your door.
I heard everything.

1132
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,310
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

1133
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:26,070
Look, I am exhausted.
You need to leave.

1134
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:28,460
No. I'm not leaving.
You owe me an explanation.

1135
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,560
- An explanation?
- Yes.

1136
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:32,390
Why did you leave the hospital?

1137
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:34,150
Why did you skip out
on your surgery?

1138
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:35,800
Why do you want to die?

1139
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:37,660
Look, I have better things to do
with my time.

1140
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,546
Better than calling your
daughter and telling her you'r...

1141
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:41,490
More important things
than calling the daughter

1142
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:43,900
Who was just using me
for source material.

1143
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,810
That's not true.

1144
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:47,740
Your story only has
one ending, Talia,

1145
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,260
And now that that's in sight,

1146
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:51,600
You don't have to dig
for content anymore.

1147
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:54,840
- You don't mean that.
- Your story's over, Talia.

1148
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:56,430
You can go.

1149
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,400
All I ever wanted
was to know you.

1150
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:09,950
I'm glad I gave you up.

1151
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:13,010
Why?

1152
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:17,030
Because if I hadn't,

1153
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:20,960
You would never have lived up
to your fullest potential.

1154
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:24,850
I would've ruined you,
just like I ruined myself.

1155
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:28,360
That's not true.
You have a good life.

1156
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:31,120
I mean, you can still have
a good life.

1157
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,470
There's so much more to do.
We could do it together.

1158
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:37,980
I am not gonna let you sit here
and watch me die, Talia.

1159
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:39,960
Do you understand?
You need to go.

1160
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:42,050
- No.
- Now!

1161
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:44,320
Go! Get out of here!

1162
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,210
Go!

1163
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:55,490
[sobbing]

1164
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:00,830
[breathing heavily]

1165
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:07,910
[exhales sharply]

1166
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,360
Mm...

1167
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,030
- Here.
- Thank you.

1168
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:33,200
[exhales sharply]

1169
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:40,620
You know, I've known Brenda
for a, a really long time.

1170
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,190
She's always been this quiet,

1171
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:47,950
Reserved woman,

1172
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:50,550
Capable of so much more
than what she has.

1173
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:55,030
The thing with Brenda
is that she feels like

1174
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:57,110
She doesn't deserve
anything better

1175
01:12:57,210 --> 01:13:00,620
Because she's worked hard
her whole life

1176
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:02,230
And hasn't had a break.

1177
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:04,950
She kind of lets
everyone use her like a doormat,

1178
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:08,470
And accepts that
as how it should be.

1179
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:10,730
She's never seen
how it could be.

1180
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:13,570
I don't understand.

1181
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:21,060
These past few months,
they've been amazing.

1182
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,490
I've only ever seen her happy.

1183
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:26,250
Never once did it seem like
she wanted to die.

1184
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:31,330
Well, look, Brenda is a master
at bottling her emotions.

1185
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:36,240
You know, I think she, she had
to turn them off to survive

1186
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:38,600
After her parents died.

1187
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:40,930
Right. Her parents.

1188
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,250
But ever since
you've been in her life,

1189
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:46,250
Something's changed.

1190
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:50,180
There is a, a spark, a-a flame.

1191
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:54,260
It-it wants to ignite, but
it needs a match to light it.

1192
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:57,020
You are that match, Talia.

1193
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:59,620
You need to keep pushing her.

1194
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:04,120
You need to show her
that life, it's worth living.

1195
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,960
[instrumental music]

1196
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:34,820
Where are we going?

1197
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,710
You'll see.

1198
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:40,490
[music continues]

1199
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,330
- Hey.
- [Brenda] hm?

1200
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:04,600
[Talia] we're here.

1201
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:12,190
Uh...

1202
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:34,690
[Brenda] it's beautiful.

1203
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:37,860
[Talia] yeah, we used
to come here when I was a kid.

1204
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:41,050
Haven't been back in years.
Everyone's always too busy.

1205
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:56,630
Wait, is, is that a...

1206
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,650
No.

1207
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:01,480
Number six,
get back into the water.

1208
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:03,390
- Talia, I can't, I can't.
- Of course you can.

1209
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:06,240
- I can't do this. Please don't...
- you can't or you won't?

1210
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:08,140
I know it's scary.

1211
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,750
I know it feels like
your chest is caving in

1212
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,750
And the air's getting
sucked out of your lungs.

1213
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:17,000
But you are not alone here.
Okay? Not anymore.

1214
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:30,930
Let's do this together, okay?
Just you and me.

1215
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:33,440
[breathing heavily]

1216
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:43,860
Come on.

1217
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:55,790
You okay? Come on.

1218
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:09,470
[instrumental music]

1219
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:42,090
[music continues]

1220
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:15,120
[music continues]

1221
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:46,740
[birds chirping]

1222
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:12,350
So, how long do you really have?

1223
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:17,180
I don't know.

1224
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,440
Maybe months.

1225
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,950
And why do you want to die?

1226
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:37,700
This...

1227
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:43,290
This life just...

1228
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,370
Wasn't what
I pictured for myself.

1229
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,950
I just thought
I would be someone

1230
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:52,720
Of more value...

1231
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:55,970
Someone with a purpose.

1232
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,980
Not just a 40-year-old woman
with a bank account.

1233
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,230
I've just been coasting along,

1234
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:10,570
A ghost in my own story.

1235
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:14,830
What about me?

1236
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,390
You were never supposed to be
part of this.

1237
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:24,740
I just wanted to warn you
about the gene mutation,

1238
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:28,080
So, so that you could do
something about it

1239
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:30,730
Before I could.

1240
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:34,830
But you can do something
about it, and you should.

1241
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:38,240
Look, I heard the doctor say
that there's a chance. Okay?

1242
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:41,020
Even if it's a small one,
you have to take it.

1243
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,930
There's so much
we missed out on.

1244
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,000
Twenty-three years of nothing,

1245
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:47,930
Of me wondering who you were,
why you didn't want me.

1246
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:50,440
And now you're back,
only to say goodbye?

1247
01:20:50,530 --> 01:20:52,066
You can't leave me
with these last few months

1248
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:54,090
And then just disappear forever.

1249
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:57,940
- Talia... Please.
- No. You have to try.

1250
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,200
Okay, mom?

1251
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,460
Please, mom?

1252
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:12,050
[sobbing]

1253
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:18,720
[Brenda sobbing]

1254
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:30,790
Okay.

1255
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:36,240
Okay. I'll try.

1256
01:21:37,970 --> 01:21:38,990
Okay.

1257
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,910
Okay.

1258
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:47,000
And, Talia...

1259
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:52,340
I want you
to publish your article.

1260
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:54,930
You sure?

1261
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:02,270
I am so proud of the woman
that you've become.

1262
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:08,160
Regardless
of what happens to me,

1263
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:12,000
I'm just so glad
that a part of me

1264
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:15,200
Will live on
through your words...

1265
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:17,950
And through you.

1266
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,290
Thank you.

1267
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:24,620
Thank you.

1268
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:28,960
One more thing.

1269
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,390
I don't have the gene mutation.

1270
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:48,650
[laughs]

1271
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:54,650
[laughing]

1272
01:22:56,490 --> 01:22:58,240
Thank god!

1273
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,080
- Ah...
- Love you, mom.

1274
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:08,160
I love you.

1275
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:17,230
Now get us back
so we can celebrate properly.

1276
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:18,510
- [Talia] okay.
- [laughs]

1277
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,180
[instrumental music]

1278
01:23:42,530 --> 01:23:45,370
[chuckles] a hundred
and twenty-six thousand views.

1279
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,260
That's wild!
I'm so proud of you.

1280
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,620
I couldn't have done it
without you. Oh!

1281
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:53,430
They have guaranteed me
the features spot

1282
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:56,710
For three articles,
they loved all the ideas I had.

1283
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:58,360
They said
I showed real potential.

1284
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:00,870
Get it, girl.
Speaking of getting it...

1285
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,630
This is quite the celebration
of life you've pulled off.

1286
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,450
Brenda put up such a fight.

1287
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:08,140
This was the least
that I could do.

1288
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:10,060
It's time.

1289
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:14,560
[Talia exhales sharply]

1290
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:18,570
[indistinct chatter]

1291
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:19,990
[door opens]

1292
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:22,960
- Keep your eyes closed.
- Oh.

1293
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:25,060
You know I trust you, right?

1294
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,060
- Okay.
- You better trust me.

1295
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,800
[Brenda laughing]

1296
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:29,560
Keep going,
I'm not gonna let you...

1297
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:32,080
Oh, my gosh! Oh.

1298
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:34,490
- Okay.
- You can open them now.

1299
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,980
[all] happy remission!

01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,760

1303

What is all of this?
