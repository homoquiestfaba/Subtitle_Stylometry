1
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,917
Imagine that you're watching the end
of one of those old romantic movies.

2
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:56,955
It's the story of a man and a woman
who are destined to be together...

3
00:00:56,995 --> 00:01:00,712
only they're divided by circumstances
beyond their control.

4
00:01:07,907 --> 00:01:12,224
We're now at the part where the leading
lady has decided to marry the wrong guy.

5
00:01:12,344 --> 00:01:15,622
He's nice, but he's wrong for her
and everyone knows it...

6
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:18,140
everyone except for the groom himself.

7
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,698
It's kind of tragic when
you think about it...

8
00:01:21,778 --> 00:01:25,495
spending the rest of your life
with someone you're not in love with.

9
00:01:28,773 --> 00:01:30,532
Please be seated.

10
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:33,890
Good afternoon.

11
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:38,487
We are gathered here today
to bring these two people together...

12
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:39,806
in holy matrimony...

13
00:01:39,886 --> 00:01:42,004
Just as you think she's about to make...

14
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:43,883
the biggest mistake of her life...

15
00:01:43,963 --> 00:01:45,802
these two people being married...

16
00:01:45,842 --> 00:01:49,479
please speak now
or forever hold your peace.

17
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:50,678
Caroline!

18
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:53,317
The leading man barges
through the doors.

19
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:54,716
Bradley.

20
00:01:54,876 --> 00:01:57,834
I got on a plane
and I flew all the way back to Malta.

21
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:00,112
But then I realized something.

22
00:02:00,432 --> 00:02:04,109
But did you ever wonder about the guy
left at the altar? The wrong guy?

23
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:08,027
My grandmother had a word
for those kind of guys: "nice guys."

24
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:11,784
Old-fashioned guys.
The kind of guys who wear sock garters.

25
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:14,782
Guys who get hay fever
and like raking leaves.

26
00:02:14,862 --> 00:02:18,979
The kind of guy you settle for because
you can't be with the one you love.

27
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:23,616
She called them Baxters.
Well, I'm a Baxter.

28
00:02:24,096 --> 00:02:25,815
And this is my story.

29
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:38,326
It all started a year and a half ago
on Monday...

30
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:40,445
my favorite day of the week.

31
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:42,923
That's when I met Caroline Swann.

32
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,961
And she was no ugly
duckling, I might add.

33
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,520
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

34
00:02:52,877 --> 00:02:54,795
So, Miss Swann...

35
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:57,074
you know your father
was my very first client.

36
00:02:57,154 --> 00:02:59,152
He has an eye for talent.

37
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,388
So you work for Manhattan
Style magazine?

38
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:09,266
It's true, although sometimes
it feels like they work for me.

39
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:10,665
I don't doubt that at all.

40
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:12,863
Actually, I was just appointed
editor in chief.

41
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:13,942
Really?

42
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:16,581
You creative types are
so impressive to me.

43
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:18,180
- Thank you.
- Un momento.

44
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,297
That's Cecil Mills, my
temporary secretary.

45
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:24,775
I guess the story really started
earlier that morning, when I met her.

46
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:26,374
I was in my office chatting...

47
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:29,132
with my colleague
and fellow Baxter, Wendall Wimms.

48
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:32,530
Two tickets
to the Brooklyn String Quartet, Ell.

49
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:36,207
I don't know, Wendall.
Thanks for offering though.

50
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:38,206
Suit yourself, Ell.

51
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:42,523
- I'm just trying to help.
- I know.

52
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:46,361
Yes?

53
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,199
Hi, I'm the temp.

54
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:52,796
Hi. I'm Elliot.

55
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:55,355
Hi. Cecil.

56
00:03:56,074 --> 00:03:58,233
This is my colleague, Wendall Wimms.

57
00:03:58,313 --> 00:03:59,712
- Hello.
- Hi.

58
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:01,470
Please come in.

59
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,689
I'm so sorry I'm late.
But I'm new to the city.

60
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,828
I'm just learning the trains...

61
00:04:06,187 --> 00:04:07,426
plus the rain.

62
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:11,784
- Please don't fire me.
- No, not at all.

63
00:04:12,143 --> 00:04:14,622
- Take off your coat. Get warm.
- Okay.

64
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,181
Wendall...

65
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,620
Where are you from?

66
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,178
I'm from Fergus Falls, Minnesota.
Have you heard of it?

67
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:22,336
It's in Otter Tail County?

68
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,495
It's the large kitchen parts capital
of the world.

69
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:25,574
Really?

70
00:04:25,654 --> 00:04:28,652
I'm the first person in my family ever
to go east of the Mississippi.

71
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:30,951
I only just got here two weeks ago.

72
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:33,169
I have an aunt who was
married in Mankato.

73
00:04:37,926 --> 00:04:40,204
I'm going to go into my office.

74
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:46,880
- It was very nice to meet you, Cecil.
- Likewise.

75
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,398
I will see you later, Elliot.

76
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:51,957
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

77
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,995
My full time secretary
Betty has the flu.

78
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:56,234
No, I should be the
one thanking you. You

79
00:04:56,235 --> 00:04:58,432
don't know how badly
I needed this job.

80
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:00,950
Excuse me.

81
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,709
- Thank you.
- Here.

82
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:06,267
Think I've caught a bit of a cold.

83
00:05:10,704 --> 00:05:11,943
Anyway...

84
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:15,900
- it's a pleasure to meet you.
- The pleasure's all mine.

85
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,938
- Here, I'll show you to your office.
- Let me just...

86
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:25,814
This is your desk.

87
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:28,652
Just let me know if you need anything.

88
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:30,771
I hope you don't mind if I just take a

89
00:05:30,772 --> 00:05:32,809
moment here to personalize
my work space.

90
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:38,285
If you don't mind me asking,
what's the dictionary for?

91
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:42,323
You won't believe this but it's actually
what I'm reading at the moment.

92
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:43,642
- I know-
- Wait!

93
00:05:43,722 --> 00:05:45,741
Before you say anything
else I need you to

94
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:47,759
know, that I am also
reading the dictionary.

95
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,198
- Really?
- Yes.

96
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:51,137
What letter are you up to?

97
00:05:51,138 --> 00:05:52,995
Right now I'm working
my way through "G."

98
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:55,114
"G." "G" is a classic.

99
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:58,352
You know, I particularly
liked the word "gromwell."

100
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:01,070
A type of plant bearing
yellowish flowers...

101
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,289
- and white stony outlets.
- And white stony outlets.

102
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:04,788
I love that word.

103
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:08,145
Actually, I've been looking
for a real gromwell all over the city...

104
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:11,783
but I can't seem to find one.
So far it's just a lot of concrete.

105
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:14,781
Though I haven't yet
been to Chinatown.

106
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:16,779
So, we both read the dictionary.

107
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:19,618
It's a truly bizarre coincidence.

108
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:21,696
- Providential.
- Fortuitous!

109
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:22,975
Happenstancial.

110
00:06:23,055 --> 00:06:24,974
- Felicitous.
- Another big word.

111
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:33,168
Miss Mills, I realize
we only just met...

112
00:06:33,288 --> 00:06:35,887
but, after work, if you're not busy...

113
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:37,965
- would you like-
- Excuse me...

114
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,883
- are you Elliot Sherman?
- Yes.

115
00:06:41,243 --> 00:06:44,401
- How can I help you?
- Would I like to what, Mr. Sherman?

116
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:46,519
- You were going to ask me a question.
- I was?

117
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:49,437
I'm Caroline Swann,
your 10:00 appointment.

118
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:51,636
Yes. Miss Swann, of course.

119
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:55,154
- I hope I wasn't interrupting.
- No, no, not at all.

120
00:06:55,673 --> 00:06:59,950
I'll show you to my office. Miss Mills,
would you hold all my calls, please?

121
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,269
Come with me.

122
00:07:03,028 --> 00:07:05,746
And, we'll need some coffee.
Some coffee.

123
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:08,625
You creative types are
so impressive to me.

124
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:12,142
Thank you. Then again,
when it comes to crunching numbers...

125
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:14,940
- I am all thumbs.
- Well, fear not.

126
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,618
Enter Elliot Sherman, CPA!

127
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:24,414
Elliot, Daddy said you were nice.
He didn't say you were funny, too.

128
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:33,448
So Daddy tells me you
were a Harvard boy.

129
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:37,045
Harvard Business. I did my
undergraduate studies at Dartmouth.

130
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,624
- I went to Dartmouth.
- You didn't.

131
00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:40,803
- I did.
- What a coincidence.

132
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:44,081
Next thing I know you'll be telling me
you jog for exercise.

133
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:48,118
- I actually speed walk.
- You speed walk and I jog.

134
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:51,116
- That is a serious coincidence.
- Yes.

135
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:53,674
- Sort of.
- Yeah.

136
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:56,973
Darn it. Elliot, I have
a 10:30 power breakfast

137
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:59,191
with the features
editor at Better Homes.

138
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,229
We haven't even started talking
about my forms.

139
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:02,628
Oh, well that's too bad.

140
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:06,226
Perhaps you would be
willing to continue...

141
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:08,904
the discussion of my forms
later this evening?

142
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:11,862
- Say, over dinner?
- Yes. That sounds good.

143
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:15,819
Perfect. I'll have my assistant's
intern's assistant's intern...

144
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,217
book a reservation
and then e-mail you to confirm.

145
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:23,214
Perfect.

146
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:27,931
It seemed hard to believe
that Caroline Gwendolyn Swann...

147
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:32,248
would actually be interested in me,
Elliot Wilbur Sherman.

148
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:35,926
Elliot Sherman.

149
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:38,804
Who knew?

150
00:08:38,844 --> 00:08:42,801
Then again, we Baxters do move
in mysterious ways.

151
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,679
It was the happiest time of my life.

152
00:08:46,878 --> 00:08:48,078
Work was going gangbusters.

153
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:51,635
I had just landed
the big Gildon's Cough Drop account.

154
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:55,673
I'd found my dream home,
the top floor of a Brooklyn brownstone.

155
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:57,791
And I rose every morning with the sun.

156
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,869
I was in the best physical
and mental shape of my life.

157
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:05,146
I exercised rigorously with my best
friend and next door neighbor, Ed.

158
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:09,983
Elliot, the feeling one gets from the
crisp, cold jet stream of air...

159
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:11,782
rushing across one's face...

160
00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:14,580
as he walks down the street
at speeds in excess...

161
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,938
of two, three, or even
four miles per hour.

162
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:21,255
Caroline and I began
courting exclusively.

163
00:09:21,655 --> 00:09:24,853
Our compatibility rating
was off the chart.

164
00:09:25,253 --> 00:09:28,131
The relationship was spontaneous
and impulsive.

165
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,208
I showed her my beloved Brooklyn.

166
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:34,646
Settled by the Dutch in the 1640s...

167
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:38,324
now home to such modern marvels
as the stoop.

168
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:41,362
We were desperately in love, she and I.

169
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:46,318
Young Turks drawn together by an
undefinable force of animal magnetism.

170
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:48,197
- Good night.
- Good night.

171
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:53,833
The fruit was ripe for the plucking.

172
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:56,791
I asked her to marry me and she agreed.

173
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:59,710
A few of my colleagues
from the office even

174
00:09:59,711 --> 00:10:01,908
got together and threw
me a little shindig.

175
00:10:01,988 --> 00:10:04,127
There's a little rumor
going around the

176
00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:06,265
office that you've
upgraded your Palm Pilot.

177
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:07,584
Is it true?

178
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:10,023
Guilty as charged, Bob.

179
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:11,981
Guilty as charged.

180
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,659
Everything was perfect
until one week ago...

181
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,258
when we visited Caroline's hometown
in Connecticut.

182
00:10:18,377 --> 00:10:21,295
That's when Hurricane Bradley
blew in off the coast.

183
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:24,093
A toast...

184
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:27,851
to Caroline and Elliot
on their pending nuptials.

185
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,647
By this time next week, Elliot, I
will be proud to call you "son."

186
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:36,365
God, I'm getting all choked up here.

187
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:38,284
- Sweetie.
- Daddy.

188
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:42,161
Anyway, cheers to Caroline and Elliot.

189
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:43,640
Cheers.

190
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,557
By the way, this fine crystal
we're drinking the bubbly out of...

191
00:10:47,637 --> 00:10:49,836
was made possible by a refund...

192
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:52,714
Elliot got me last year for Christmas.

193
00:10:52,794 --> 00:10:56,151
He said, "Alan, stop
risking your money...

194
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:58,230
"and start frisking your money."

195
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:00,549
Elliot.

196
00:11:00,628 --> 00:11:03,946
It's a lot less fun for me
but it sure does pay off.

197
00:11:04,026 --> 00:11:06,185
Well, Alan, it's like I always say:

198
00:11:06,225 --> 00:11:08,823
"Compromise is the key to success."

199
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:10,742
Here, here!

200
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,978
So, Elliot, tell us. Where
are you two going on your honeymoon?

201
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:18,377
- Have you decided yet?
- Yes, we have.

202
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:20,735
Yellowstone National Park...

203
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:26,451
for one whole week of camping,
lake fishing, and guided tours.

204
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,629
I wanted to go to Majorca
for the beautiful

205
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,528
beaches, fine dining and nightlife.

206
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:35,085
- Elliot and I have never been dancing.
- Oh, that's too bad.

207
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:36,884
I have two left feet.

208
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:38,843
No, you don't.

209
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:40,961
I have webbed feet.

210
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,680
So it's Yellowstone.

211
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,557
- Watch out for bears, you two.
- Yes, good advice.

212
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:50,755
I hear bears can smell menstrual blood
from a mile away.

213
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:55,791
So, Caroline...

214
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:58,390
what's this thing
you all are doing after dinner?

215
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,849
Some of my high school friends...

216
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:02,267
are throwing us
a little shindig at Andy's Tavern.

217
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,186
Most of them have never
met Elliot before.

218
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,344
- Oh, that should be fun.
- Yeah.

219
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:10,102
Come to think of it, I haven't seen
many of them in years, either.

220
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:12,340
I need to go upstairs and primp.

221
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:15,418
Girls will be girls.

222
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:17,177
I guess that means
we're finished eating.

223
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:22,813
It's like I always say, communication
is the key to a great relationship.

224
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:25,611
And if you've got something to say,
just say it.

225
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:33,046
Caroline! I need to talk to you!

226
00:12:34,206 --> 00:12:36,084
I need to talk to you, Caroline!

227
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:38,802
What has gotten into you, Elliot?

228
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:42,920
Caroline, I saw photographs of you
and your high school sweetheart Bradley.

229
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,318
Potsdamer Platz.

230
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:49,955
Here's another one. My family loves
to have their picture taken...

231
00:12:49,995 --> 00:12:52,034
in front of famous street signs.

232
00:12:52,113 --> 00:12:54,152
- Here we are in front of Fleet Street.
- Right.

233
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,271
Here we are in front
of the Champs Elysees.

234
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:58,350
Now, are these photographs
from that big

235
00:12:58,351 --> 00:13:00,348
trip you all took to
Europe back in 1987?

236
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:02,946
- Exactly.
- It sounded like quite an adventure.

237
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:05,624
Caroline's told me all about
the Russian couple...

238
00:13:05,704 --> 00:13:07,423
you befriended in Moscow.

239
00:13:07,543 --> 00:13:09,542
Olaf and Mirabelle.

240
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:11,900
- She told you about them?
- Oh, yes.

241
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,658
Caroline and I share everything.
We have no secrets.

242
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,855
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Yes.

243
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:24,891
- And this...
- And this must be your grandparents'...

244
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,769
summer home in Virginia Beach.

245
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:30,288
Caroline's told me many a story...

246
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:33,446
about Nana's barn parties.

247
00:13:33,805 --> 00:13:37,203
And Noonoo's all night
ping pong tournaments.

248
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,542
I must say, it sounds
like so much fun.

249
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:41,800
Oh, so, so much fun.

250
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,998
And this must be...

251
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,435
This must be...

252
00:13:51,913 --> 00:13:53,392
Who's this?

253
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:56,310
It's Caroline and Bradley.

254
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,188
Caroline and who?

255
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,625
You don't know about Bradley?

256
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,904
Even I know about Bradley.

257
00:14:05,984 --> 00:14:08,942
They were practically inseparable
all through high school.

258
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,861
He was the love of her life.

259
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,179
I mean, besides you, of course.

260
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:17,376
- That's what this is about?
- I thought we had no secrets, honey.

261
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:21,613
- We don't. That was fifteen years ago.
- Just tell me. I need to know.

262
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:24,931
- Are you still in love with him?
- No!

263
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:27,489
Bradley and I have
completely lost touch.

264
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:30,927
Elliot, I never think of him. Ever.
He lives in Lillehammer.

265
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:32,646
- Really?
- Yes.

266
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:36,084
It would take an act of God
for us to ever cross paths again.

267
00:14:36,363 --> 00:14:38,882
- Caroline?
- Bradley?

268
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,159
- What are you doing...
- What are you doing...

269
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:45,757
- I'm here on business.
- I'm getting married.

270
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:48,475
Hey, hon.

271
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,233
Sonya, this is Caroline.
Caroline, Sonya.

272
00:14:52,234 --> 00:14:53,952
This is my new girlfriend.

273
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:56,989
- Hi.
- Bradley's told me so much about you.

274
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,247
You all right?

275
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:01,886
I must be allergic
to something in here.

276
00:15:10,141 --> 00:15:12,819
Elliot. This is my fiance Bradley.

277
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:14,698
Shoot, I mean...

278
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:18,335
Bradley, this is my fiance Elliot.

279
00:15:19,894 --> 00:15:24,331
Elliot, nice to meet you.
You must be a special, special guy.

280
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,608
- God, it's good to see you.
- You, too.

281
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:33,525
As I commuted to work the next day,
I decided to focus on the positive.

282
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:38,122
I've got a good job, great health,
and a fiancee who likes me.

283
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,917
John, Juan, Jan, Jonah.

284
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:01,106
Mr. Sherman?

285
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:04,384
Cecil. Mills.

286
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:07,942
- The temp.
- Yes. You remembered.

287
00:16:08,062 --> 00:16:09,781
What are you doing here?

288
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,579
I'm temping for a dentist
on the 7th floor.

289
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:15,297
Oh, yeah. Jim Dudley. Good guy.

290
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:18,974
- Here, let me help you up.
- Thank you.

291
00:16:23,611 --> 00:16:26,449
- You're stepping on my toe.
- Sorry.

292
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:39,600
So Miss Mills, how have you been?

293
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,718
- It's been at least a year.
- Good. I've been good.

294
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:43,758
Good.

295
00:16:44,077 --> 00:16:45,876
I finally figured out
how the subways work.

296
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:47,675
I can go uptown, downtown, cross-town.

297
00:16:47,755 --> 00:16:49,234
That's great.

298
00:16:50,273 --> 00:16:53,471
Plus I got my own apartment
in Washington Heights.

299
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,428
Sometimes I miss the sky,
but I love the crazy people.

300
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:01,586
- How about you? How have you been?
- Me?

301
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,903
I'm good. Very good.
Nothing much to report.

302
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:13,857
My fiancee is leaving
me for another man.

303
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,935
Oh, no. What happened?

304
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:21,452
It's a long story, Miss Mills.
I don't want to waste your time.

305
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:23,171
Please, I don't mind.

306
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:27,888
Okay. Well, it all started 15 years ago
at my senior prom.

307
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:29,527
See, there was this girl.

308
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:32,005
It was the last dance of the night.

309
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:35,123
- Kimberly, would you...
- Yes?

310
00:17:36,642 --> 00:17:38,481
Like some more soda?

311
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:41,799
Okay. Sure.

312
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:46,076
So, while I was mixing drinks, Max
Webster, who was incredibly popular...

313
00:17:46,156 --> 00:17:48,714
barges through the doors
and sweeps my date off her feet.

314
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:50,073
Kimberly.

315
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:53,831
- Max, what are you doing here?
- I realized something.

316
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,549
I realized that being cool...

317
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:59,227
isn't about what kind
of a spliff you can roll at a party...

318
00:17:59,307 --> 00:18:02,105
or how good I look tick-tacking
on my skateboard.

319
00:18:02,185 --> 00:18:05,782
Being cool is about who you are.
And I know you broke your leg.

320
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:08,860
But what I really want to know is...

321
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:11,938
will you dance with me?

322
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:15,176
Yes, Max. I would love
to dance with you.

323
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:18,054
Max and Kimberly lived
happily ever after.

324
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:22,411
But then, I went to college
and gave love another shot.

325
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,129
- Are you cold, Serena?
- A little.

326
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:27,208
I'll go to the car and fetch your coat.

327
00:18:27,288 --> 00:18:29,167
But the car is so far away.

328
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:32,365
Well, I'd give you my coat
but it's way too big for you.

329
00:18:32,884 --> 00:18:34,683
I don't mind if it's too big.

330
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:36,642
And I don't mind going to get the coat.

331
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:39,720
Give it up for the captain
of the lacrosse team, Tanner Bates!

332
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,597
I was gonna come up here and talk
about how tough the Big Green are...

333
00:18:44,277 --> 00:18:48,833
but I've realized that I'm not
quite as tough as I think am.

334
00:18:50,273 --> 00:18:52,311
- You see there's this girl.
- No!

335
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:56,189
And on Saturday afternoon she's trying
to win a scholarship to Julliard.

336
00:18:56,268 --> 00:19:00,146
So, I encourage all of you
to skip the lacrosse game with me...

337
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:02,704
and come out to the recital hall
and root her on!

338
00:19:02,784 --> 00:19:05,143
- Oh, Tanner!
- Serena.

339
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,537
Serena, I realized that if winning
a big game means losing you...

340
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:18,534
- then I don't want to play the game.
- God, Tanner, that's beautiful.

341
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:22,051
You look cold. Here, take my sweater.

342
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:24,969
He skipped the lacrosse game
to watch her Julliard tryout?

343
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:28,087
Yeah. They lived happily
ever after, too.

344
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:30,925
So after that, I went
to business school.

345
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:33,004
And fell for Camryn.

346
00:19:33,124 --> 00:19:35,042
She also had an ex-boyfriend...

347
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:37,321
Hunter.

348
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,559
He had a dog with him.

349
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,078
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

350
00:19:42,437 --> 00:19:46,395
Which brings us to this morning
at Caroline's parents' house.

351
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:48,074
Caroline!

352
00:19:50,032 --> 00:19:51,991
Elliot, are you all right?

353
00:19:52,311 --> 00:19:54,789
I had this terrible dream last night...

354
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,028
that Bradley was at the bar.

355
00:19:57,667 --> 00:20:00,146
- He was at the bar, honey.
- He was?

356
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:04,503
My God, it wasn't a dream.

357
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:10,838
Honey, just hear me out, okay?
I've really been thinking about this.

358
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:12,297
We should get married right away.

359
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,696
Tonight, tomorrow at the latest.
You know, we could elope.

360
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:17,614
- I've always wanted to go to Las Vegas.
- No! Elliot, stop it!

361
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:19,173
You're scaring me.

362
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:28,007
Now, Elliot, I'm
bringing the new wedding

363
00:20:28,008 --> 00:20:29,486
planner by the apartment tomorrow.

364
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:31,145
He's really bailing us out last minute.

365
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:34,043
I mean, Jacob was supposed to be
the best wedding planner in the city.

366
00:20:34,123 --> 00:20:37,001
We profiled him in last year's
winter double issue.

367
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:40,239
And then he just disappeared.
How's that for loyalty?

368
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:44,995
Anyway, this new planner
comes highly recommended.

369
00:20:46,035 --> 00:20:48,953
He gave us a questionnaire
we're supposed to fill out.

370
00:20:49,512 --> 00:20:51,391
I'm putting it in your briefcase.

371
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,388
Please fill it out, Elliot.
It's really important to me.

372
00:20:56,907 --> 00:21:00,625
He's coming by at 9:00 tomorrow.
So no sleeping in, silly face.

373
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:03,263
God, he's good.

374
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,818
My gosh, it's Bradley.

375
00:21:11,378 --> 00:21:13,017
Still leaving your key under the mat.

376
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:16,574
The more things change,
the more they stay the same.

377
00:21:17,094 --> 00:21:20,452
So Bradley, what brings you by?

378
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:23,210
Well, I was hoping I could get a lift
into the Big Apple.

379
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,648
I've got some obligations to attend to.

380
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:30,525
Obligations? What sort of obligations?
What's your line of work anyway, Brad?

381
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,283
- Geodes.
- Geodes?

382
00:21:33,443 --> 00:21:34,562
Yeah.

383
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:38,160
It's like a hollow rock
lined with crystals.

384
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,638
And you sell them?

385
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:43,716
No. My job is to
discover how they form.

386
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,395
I'm a scientist.

387
00:21:45,675 --> 00:21:47,553
- That's noble.
- Noble? God, no.

388
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:49,232
Noble nothing. I made millions.

389
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:51,111
Anyway, the reason I
need to get into the

390
00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:52,910
city is when I'm in
town I got a gig...

391
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,708
at an old folks' home
out at Ditmas Park.

392
00:21:54,788 --> 00:21:56,947
I bring my geodes
and let them pass them around.

393
00:21:57,027 --> 00:22:00,065
- That's wonderful, Bradley.
- Yeah, it's nice.

394
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:03,123
You know, old people
aren't really revered

395
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:05,101
in this culture the
way they should be.

396
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:09,738
Since my mom died I've just enjoyed
hanging around with the elderly.

397
00:22:11,577 --> 00:22:13,096
So much wisdom there.

398
00:22:14,575 --> 00:22:15,694
Anyway...

399
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:19,372
What about you, Eli? What do you do?

400
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:23,009
Elliot works for the second best
tax accounting firm in the city.

401
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:25,048
That's where he's headed this morning.

402
00:22:25,128 --> 00:22:27,966
Yes, indeed. I have a
deadline to attend to.

403
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:32,163
An accountant. God, I could use you.
Actually, I could use seven of you.

404
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,199
Anyway, how about that ride?

405
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:41,997
Well, I'm staying another night
with my folks...

406
00:22:42,157 --> 00:22:45,514
but Elliot's going into the city.
He can drive you. Elbow?

407
00:22:45,954 --> 00:22:48,352
Okay. Yes. Sure.

408
00:22:49,112 --> 00:22:52,030
I'll just go out into the hallway...

409
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,788
put my driving cap on
and then we can head off.

410
00:22:54,988 --> 00:22:55,987
Great.

411
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,539
You look great, carrot.

412
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:12,416
- How about this weather, huh?
- Yeah.

413
00:23:13,535 --> 00:23:14,895
You remember that blizzard?

414
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:16,134
- Sophomore year.
- Yeah.

415
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:17,573
We got snowed in.

416
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:20,331
It was so cold.

417
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:24,088
- I remember getting naked to keep warm.
- Yeah.

418
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:27,566
- And I slipped you my big, fat-
- Hey! Let's...

419
00:23:27,646 --> 00:23:30,484
get that load on the
road, shall we, champs?

420
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:33,802
Bradley.

421
00:23:34,801 --> 00:23:36,520
And Caroline, I'll
call you later, honey.

422
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:38,239
All right.

423
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:50,830
Elliot, has this ever happened to you?

424
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,669
What's that, Bradley?

425
00:23:54,108 --> 00:23:57,986
You're living your life, chugging along,
and then suddenly something...

426
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:02,542
unexpected happens.
Heartbeat. Your whole world changes.

427
00:24:02,622 --> 00:24:06,140
Like what would be an example
of one of those unexpected things?

428
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,419
Well, I guess like...

429
00:24:09,618 --> 00:24:13,535
seeing Caroline after so many years
would be a good example.

430
00:24:14,614 --> 00:24:17,492
What's... Give me another example.

431
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:22,449
See, that's kind of the example
that comes to mind right now.

432
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:23,808
Okay.

433
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:25,247
It's, like, sometimes destiny calls...

434
00:24:25,287 --> 00:24:26,906
you either answer the call
or you hang up the phone.

435
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:28,525
You know what I'm saying?

436
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:30,883
- I hope not.
- Unexpected things happen, Elliot.

437
00:24:30,923 --> 00:24:32,183
When they do you need
to make a decision.

438
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:33,242
Do you, though?

439
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:36,240
The question is: are you going to act?
Or are you just gonna sit there...

440
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,118
and let possibly the biggest decision
of your life just pass you by?

441
00:24:39,198 --> 00:24:42,316
- You just sit there. You need the rest.
- No.

442
00:24:42,476 --> 00:24:43,815
You act. Am I right?
You risk everything.

443
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,154
Why?

444
00:24:45,394 --> 00:24:48,072
- Why do you do that?
- Because you're a great guy...

445
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:50,031
and you have nothing to lose.

446
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,579
Thank you.

447
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:16,053
God, it feels so good
to get this stuff...

448
00:25:17,012 --> 00:25:18,931
off my chest, you know.

449
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:25,567
Thank you, Elliot. You really helped me.
I don't have...

450
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:29,364
You know, I don't have
a lot of guy friends

451
00:25:29,365 --> 00:25:31,043
that I can talk to about this stuff.

452
00:25:33,841 --> 00:25:35,160
You're welcome.

453
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:37,399
It's like I'm...

454
00:25:37,878 --> 00:25:40,956
It's like I'm too sensitive, you know?

455
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:44,914
It's like I'm missing a layer of skin
or something. You know?

456
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:50,270
It's like I let too much in.

457
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:03,381
So Bradley got out of my car. He said,
"Thanks for the lift, Ell train"...

458
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,580
and that was that.

459
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,619
And all this makes you think
that you're a Baxter?

460
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,418
Yeah. Silly, right?

461
00:26:09,697 --> 00:26:12,335
Personally, I don't believe in Baxters.

462
00:26:13,854 --> 00:26:16,412
Although did you and your prom date
dance at all that night?

463
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,731
No. She was on crutches.

464
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,449
What?

465
00:26:22,408 --> 00:26:25,286
This is my floor.
Mr. Sherman, I've got to go.

466
00:26:25,326 --> 00:26:28,884
What were you going to say?
Dr. Dudley hates it when we're tardy.

467
00:26:29,124 --> 00:26:32,881
Please, what were you going to say?
I'd really like to know, Miss Mills.

468
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:34,480
Mr. Sherman...

469
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:47,991
I'll be at this address tonight if you
feel like finishing this conversation.

470
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,389
Wait! What is this place?

471
00:26:53,388 --> 00:26:55,626
So, Elliot, let me get this straight.

472
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:59,623
You met some temp in an elevator. She
starts to say something, doesn't say it.

473
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:02,661
And now you want to go out in the
middle of the night to find her...

474
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:04,580
so she can, what?

475
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,139
So she can finish her sentence?

476
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:08,897
Elliot, you've got my knickers
all up in a pinch here.

477
00:27:08,937 --> 00:27:10,336
I don't know, Ed.

478
00:27:10,456 --> 00:27:13,814
I don't know. I feel like maybe
she could help me or cure me.

479
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:17,211
- Will you talk to him, Stella?
- Maybe your Feng Shui is off.

480
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:18,291
Maybe.

481
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:20,369
You know, she's got a friend
who could do your chart.

482
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:21,649
No, it's a wheel.

483
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,967
Ed, it's not a chart. It's a wheel.

484
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:26,365
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

485
00:27:28,444 --> 00:27:30,962
Here, Elliot, have some more wine.

486
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:35,239
This is an Acorn Creek pinot noir 2002.

487
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,278
Go on.

488
00:27:38,397 --> 00:27:42,475
Notice how the rich cherry
and raspberry fruit dominate the nose.

489
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:45,233
It's bold...

490
00:27:45,552 --> 00:27:48,430
with a sweetly edged meaty complexity.

491
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,788
Stella's taking a wine-tasting class
at the YMCA.

492
00:27:51,868 --> 00:27:54,746
"W," Ed. The YWCA.

493
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:57,824
Look, you want help? Go see a doctor.

494
00:27:57,904 --> 00:28:00,582
You want trouble, you go see this girl.
Am I right, Stella?

495
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:02,781
No. I think it sounds interesting.

496
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,738
Go with your gut, Elliot.
That's what you should do.

497
00:28:06,858 --> 00:28:08,177
Excuse me.

498
00:28:14,453 --> 00:28:16,691
Here's what I think you should do...

499
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:18,970
Can you please turn that down?

500
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,169
How's this?

501
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:26,365
God, I love that woman.

502
00:28:27,524 --> 00:28:30,562
Here's what I think you should do.
I think you should take that address...

503
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,360
I think you should rip it up,
I think you should throw it away...

504
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,139
and I think you should
forget this whole

505
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,878
thing ever happened.
That's what I think.

506
00:28:37,597 --> 00:28:39,716
- Maybe you're right.
- I know I'm right.

507
00:28:39,796 --> 00:28:42,394
Elliot, all you need is
a good night's sleep.

508
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:46,072
Yeah. What was I thinking?

509
00:28:47,231 --> 00:28:50,709
That's what friends are for.
Come on, give your Uncle Ed a hug.

510
00:28:51,148 --> 00:28:55,425
Come on, give Uncle Ed a hug.
Let's go. Chop chop.

511
00:28:59,223 --> 00:29:01,781
- You're hurting me, Ed.
- Go get some shuteye.

512
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,820
Good night, Elliot.

513
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,539
- Ed?
- Yeah, baby?

514
00:29:08,537 --> 00:29:11,814
In the dictionary
the word irrational is defined as:

515
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:15,292
"Affected by loss of usual
or normal mental clarity.

516
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:18,130
"Incoherent, as from shock."

517
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,837
This is crazy. This is crazy.

518
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:10,335
I thought she sang
like a beautiful bird.

519
00:30:10,895 --> 00:30:15,212
Like a purple sandpiper,
or a rose-breasted grosbeak.

520
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:30,162
Cecil Mills everybody. Cecil Mills!

521
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:34,039
Guys, I think I hear the turkey phone.

522
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:37,996
That means we only have one more act
and I'm gonna go get her right now...

523
00:30:38,076 --> 00:30:40,355
Mr. Sherman. You made it.

524
00:30:40,435 --> 00:30:43,553
Yes. I was in the neighborhood so I
figured I'd pop my head in the door.

525
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,351
I'm happy you came.

526
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:49,309
- So, you're a singer?
- Yeah.

527
00:30:51,987 --> 00:30:55,265
That was terrible.
I'm really sorry you had to see that.

528
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,901
The sound system here is unbearable.
Really I could hardly hear myself.

529
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:04,459
And I usually have a guitar player
but he's in the hospital.

530
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:05,858
He's very old.

531
00:31:05,978 --> 00:31:08,896
He's fine and everything.
I went to go visit him, but you know...

532
00:31:08,976 --> 00:31:11,195
Normally, I'm just better.
I'm not saying I'm

533
00:31:11,196 --> 00:31:13,413
very good, but I usually
am better than...

534
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:17,530
- You say something.
- I thought you were really great.

535
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:20,528
Really? Thanks.

536
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:24,725
My boyfriend thinks I'm wasting my time.

537
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:29,322
- Oh, you have a boyfriend?
- Yeah. Dan. He's nice.

538
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,520
He couldn't make it.

539
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,919
- Do you wanna sit down?
- Yeah.

540
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:34,958
Okay.

541
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:47,430
So, Miss Mills, I should tell you
that I disagree with your boyfriend.

542
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,868
I don't think you're wasting your time.

543
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,346
I appreciate that.

544
00:31:52,466 --> 00:31:54,985
All right guys,
guess who was on the turkey phone?

545
00:31:55,065 --> 00:31:57,663
I don't know. An interpretative dancer?

546
00:31:57,743 --> 00:31:59,602
That's right, we have
an interpretative

547
00:31:59,603 --> 00:32:01,460
dancer here tonight to
end the show, guys.

548
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,898
Put your hands together.
Put your hands together for Exar.

549
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:08,016
Hi, can I get a beer?
Whatever's on tap and cheap.

550
00:32:08,096 --> 00:32:10,574
Hi. I'll have a Harvey Wallbanger.

551
00:32:11,254 --> 00:32:14,212
No actually,
make that a white wine spritzer. Thanks.

552
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:17,130
It's almost spring.

553
00:32:26,443 --> 00:32:28,962
So, Miss Mills, tell
me about your singing.

554
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,437
It's good. I mean, it's good.
You know it's...

555
00:32:39,515 --> 00:32:40,594
What?

556
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,910
- It's the stage fright.
- Really?

557
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,708
- What, you didn't notice?
- No.

558
00:32:48,788 --> 00:32:49,788
Really?

559
00:32:51,227 --> 00:32:54,225
Ever since I started singing
my own material in front of people...

560
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,343
I feel like I've developed a problem
with stage fright.

561
00:32:58,182 --> 00:33:01,060
I feel like I'm naked...

562
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,818
and shaking and underwater.

563
00:33:05,937 --> 00:33:07,416
What about you?

564
00:33:07,616 --> 00:33:10,734
Did you always know
that you wanted to be an accountant?

565
00:33:10,854 --> 00:33:14,371
Sort of. I always knew
that I wanted steady employment.

566
00:33:15,011 --> 00:33:18,568
It's also got very good benefits.
Plus I get a paid vacation.

567
00:33:19,528 --> 00:33:23,605
Plus I like numbers. So I feel
like I'm helping people. Gracias.

568
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:39,834
Guys, that's the end of the show.

569
00:33:39,914 --> 00:33:42,592
But listen, it only gets started
'cause we have a party!

570
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:45,350
We have a party right here, right now!
So everybody stick around!

571
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,428
- Let's start the music!
- What do you say, Mr. Sherman?

572
00:33:48,828 --> 00:33:50,147
I think I'm okay.

573
00:33:50,707 --> 00:33:52,106
I should probably get going.

574
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:55,544
No. It could be fun. When was the last
time that you were at a real party?

575
00:33:55,623 --> 00:33:59,381
Well, we have backwards jeans day
at my office...

576
00:33:59,461 --> 00:34:02,779
which is fun because we get to wear
our jeans on backwards.

577
00:34:02,939 --> 00:34:04,498
What about if you just
finish this drink...

578
00:34:04,577 --> 00:34:07,615
and if you're not having fun
you can leave, I promise.

579
00:34:08,015 --> 00:34:09,134
Okay.

580
00:34:11,053 --> 00:34:14,891
I'm allergic to peanuts
and lint and cereal...

581
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,609
and paint, magic markers...

582
00:34:18,408 --> 00:34:21,046
sand mats, yogurt...

583
00:34:21,246 --> 00:34:23,005
Because I met this girl...

584
00:34:23,844 --> 00:34:27,522
who got a job whistling a jingle
for a commercial...

585
00:34:27,882 --> 00:34:30,480
and she made tons of money.
She does the...

586
00:34:35,277 --> 00:34:38,435
So I was thinking that I could sign up
for a class at HG Studios...

587
00:34:38,515 --> 00:34:40,833
because it's a real craft, whistling.

588
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,429
Cecil, I have to ask you a question!

589
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:52,585
What were you going to say to me
in the elevator?

590
00:34:54,424 --> 00:34:56,223
It's too loud in here!

591
00:34:58,061 --> 00:34:59,021
Come on.

592
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:05,017
Where are we going?

593
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:14,530
- Better?
- Much.

594
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:19,327
- Elliot?
- Yes.

595
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:23,844
I think this alcohol
is going to my head.

596
00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:26,722
So, I would just like to apologize
in advance...

597
00:35:26,802 --> 00:35:29,920
for anything that I may say
or do from this point forward.

598
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,959
Okay.

599
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:33,917
- I like your tie.
- Thank you.

600
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:37,795
It was a gift from my mother...

601
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:39,913
for Christmas.

602
00:35:41,512 --> 00:35:44,550
It's from the Fricke,
from the Dutch Masters Collection.

603
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,589
- I like it.
- Thank you.

604
00:35:48,508 --> 00:35:50,227
Miss Mills, you were
going to tell me what

605
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:51,945
you were going to say in the elevator.

606
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:52,985
Okay.

607
00:35:56,462 --> 00:35:58,461
Here's what I was going to say.

608
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:04,097
- Elliot, I have a theory.
- Yes?

609
00:36:05,136 --> 00:36:07,415
You were supposed to ask her to dance.

610
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:11,052
- What are you talking about?
- At your prom.

611
00:36:11,452 --> 00:36:12,971
You were supposed to ask her to dance.

612
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:16,049
It was the last song of the night.
All the other kids were dancing.

613
00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:17,888
You should have asked her to dance.

614
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:21,485
- But she was on crutches.
- But it was a slow song, Elliot.

615
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:26,402
- She seemed happy to me.
- She was content, not happy.

616
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:30,559
See, Elliot, ultimately the problem is
that you're not willing to take risks.

617
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,998
You've got to be willing to take risks.

618
00:36:33,437 --> 00:36:34,836
You're right.

619
00:36:36,315 --> 00:36:38,954
I've got to take more risks.

620
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:42,111
It's so obvious but I couldn't see it.

621
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:47,948
My God.

622
00:36:50,106 --> 00:36:51,105
What?

623
00:36:51,865 --> 00:36:53,664
This is the song.

624
00:36:53,824 --> 00:36:56,422
This is the song they were playing
at my prom.

625
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:03,857
Ask her to dance, Elliot.

626
00:37:05,176 --> 00:37:06,175
Cecil...

627
00:37:08,174 --> 00:37:09,533
would you...

628
00:37:10,892 --> 00:37:13,131
Other people need to use the bathroom.

629
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,169
- I should probably go.
- I should go home.

630
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:18,727
Yeah. We should both go.

631
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:21,285
Okay.

632
00:37:23,404 --> 00:37:25,202
I hope I was able to help you
with your problem.

633
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:27,361
Oh yes, definitely. Very much so.

634
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:30,599
Ask her to dance. Very good advice.

635
00:37:31,158 --> 00:37:32,558
Listen...

636
00:37:33,157 --> 00:37:34,636
here's my card.

637
00:37:35,675 --> 00:37:39,273
If ever I can repay the favor just...

638
00:37:40,112 --> 00:37:42,351
call anytime. Really.

639
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:45,429
I'm going to write
my home phone number on it.

640
00:37:46,468 --> 00:37:49,066
Call me anytime if you need anything.

641
00:37:51,265 --> 00:37:53,543
- Okay.
- Good night.

642
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:57,221
I'll be off then.

643
00:38:07,734 --> 00:38:10,972
You've reached Elliot Sherman.
Please leave a message. Thank you.

644
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:14,010
Elliot, it's Cecil.
Can you please pick up the phone?

645
00:38:15,928 --> 00:38:17,128
Cecil?

646
00:38:17,247 --> 00:38:19,646
- You said I could call you anytime?
- What happened?

647
00:38:19,726 --> 00:38:21,844
It's just really hard, you know.

648
00:38:22,924 --> 00:38:26,121
I mean, normally, Dan and I don't fight.
We really don't.

649
00:38:26,201 --> 00:38:29,559
But I just wish that he would
come to hear me sing, you know.

650
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:33,756
It would just be nice to look out into
the audience and see a familiar face...

651
00:38:33,796 --> 00:38:36,994
but he says that my stage fright
makes him uncomfortable.

652
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:41,311
I think I'm very supportive of him.

653
00:38:42,391 --> 00:38:46,068
He wants to analyze systems,
which I think is fantastic.

654
00:38:46,148 --> 00:38:49,985
And you know what he thinks
I'd be good at? Sales.

655
00:38:53,063 --> 00:38:56,661
Doesn't he understand I played Annie
in my high school production of Annie?

656
00:38:56,741 --> 00:38:59,619
Not one, not two, but
three times in a row.

657
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:03,496
Miss Mills, we sort of have to keep
it down 'cause of the neighbors.

658
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:05,135
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

659
00:39:05,215 --> 00:39:07,414
Here let me help you with those.

660
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:12,410
I got it. It's okay. I got it.

661
00:39:22,284 --> 00:39:26,041
Do you have something that I could
sleep in maybe, like a sweatshirt?

662
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,078
Sometimes it sticks. Thank you.

663
00:39:33,076 --> 00:39:36,874
- I have pajamas.
- Yeah. Pajamas would be great.

664
00:39:37,034 --> 00:39:38,033
Pajamas.

665
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,628
Do you play the piano?

666
00:39:51,744 --> 00:39:52,943
I dabble.

667
00:39:53,902 --> 00:39:55,461
Here, take your pick.

668
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:58,360
I'll pick these. They
look like the tape.

669
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:00,218
Yeah. Good choice.

670
00:40:00,258 --> 00:40:01,257
Thanks.

671
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:04,655
Okay.

672
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:19,165
This really is a great apartment.

673
00:40:22,843 --> 00:40:24,842
I like it. It's very practical.

674
00:40:25,201 --> 00:40:26,281
Thank you.

675
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,758
- Can I put these on in there?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

676
00:40:37,073 --> 00:40:40,671
Boy, I haven't been this
tipsy in a long time.

677
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,510
And I...

678
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:48,666
I haven't been up this late since...

679
00:40:48,945 --> 00:40:51,664
business school, final exams, probably.

680
00:41:01,177 --> 00:41:02,576
These are great.

681
00:41:09,811 --> 00:41:12,410
- They suit you perfectly.
- Thank you.

682
00:41:18,086 --> 00:41:21,803
- Okay. See you in the morning, Cecil.
- See you in the morning.

683
00:41:31,597 --> 00:41:33,955
- Good night, Cecil.
- Good night, Elliot.

684
00:41:50,984 --> 00:41:53,382
Okay, we're here. This is it.

685
00:42:03,056 --> 00:42:04,055
Ell?

686
00:42:04,495 --> 00:42:07,692
It's like a rail road apartment.
Choo choo.

687
00:42:09,091 --> 00:42:10,810
- Hi, honey.
- There you are.

688
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:15,527
Elliot, hi.
This is Benson the wedding planner.

689
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,766
Benson Hedges, nice to meet you.

690
00:42:17,806 --> 00:42:20,004
Very nice to meet you, too, Benson...

691
00:42:20,524 --> 00:42:21,523
Hedges.

692
00:42:22,203 --> 00:42:24,241
Come, sit down. Sit down.

693
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,679
What's up with the cushions?

694
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:32,716
This is what my shlong free chart
says I should do.

695
00:42:32,796 --> 00:42:35,074
- What did you say?
- Feng Shui.

696
00:42:35,474 --> 00:42:36,593
Yeah. What he said.

697
00:42:36,673 --> 00:42:39,551
Feng Shui. I didn't know you
were into that, Elliot.

698
00:42:39,831 --> 00:42:43,988
Can I get us all something to drink?
Coffee? Tea? Milk? Apple juice?

699
00:42:44,108 --> 00:42:46,706
- I'll have tea.
- I would love an apple juice.

700
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:48,705
Great.

701
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:57,379
I love the walls. Very mustard. Dijon.

702
00:42:58,858 --> 00:43:02,336
Yeah, I don't think we're gonna
live here after we get married.

703
00:43:03,095 --> 00:43:04,574
Moving into my place.

704
00:43:06,373 --> 00:43:08,611
Three cups of ice cold water.

705
00:43:09,011 --> 00:43:11,490
Caroline. Mr. Hedges.

706
00:43:13,848 --> 00:43:16,886
So, Elliot, this is
Benson's wedding booklet.

707
00:43:16,966 --> 00:43:19,084
It is full of possibilities.

708
00:43:19,124 --> 00:43:23,282
Like I always said, Mr. Sherman,
"variety is the spice of life."

709
00:43:24,161 --> 00:43:25,280
Ching ching.

710
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,518
I am so sorry, Mr. Sherman.

711
00:43:29,797 --> 00:43:31,236
- Oh, my.
- Wait.

712
00:43:31,516 --> 00:43:34,354
The lacy pink women's panties.
I can explain that.

713
00:43:34,394 --> 00:43:37,752
Well, they say Brooklyn, New York,
but I say Brooklyn, Wisconsin.

714
00:43:37,832 --> 00:43:40,190
It's out in the middle of nowhere here.

715
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,149
Elliot! Wake up!

716
00:43:42,229 --> 00:43:45,027
Elliot, wake up. Your fiancee is outside
your apartment with some guy.

717
00:43:45,107 --> 00:43:47,106
No! The wedding planner!

718
00:43:47,186 --> 00:43:48,625
I completely forgot!

719
00:43:48,665 --> 00:43:51,423
Okay, kisses. Goodbye.
You hang up first.

720
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:56,100
No! Cecil.

721
00:43:57,539 --> 00:43:59,657
You have to hide that somewhere.

722
00:44:01,776 --> 00:44:02,775
Where?

723
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,133
I left the keys in the car.

724
00:44:05,213 --> 00:44:06,293
- It should be right-
- Okay...

725
00:44:06,373 --> 00:44:08,451
you know what? Hold this for a second.
Hands free.

726
00:44:08,531 --> 00:44:11,049
I know. Here. Under the pillow.
Right here.

727
00:44:12,009 --> 00:44:13,008
Perfect.

728
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,405
Hello, Brooklyn.

729
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:22,282
Could you go back to my bedroom
and get me a suit and a tie?

730
00:44:22,362 --> 00:44:24,201
I got to go to the bathroom.

731
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,837
- I swear...
- Here she comes.

732
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:31,756
I would lose my head
if it weren't screwed on.

733
00:44:33,235 --> 00:44:35,753
Okay. Three story walkup. I know.

734
00:44:35,913 --> 00:44:37,712
I don't know why anyone lives
without a doorman.

735
00:44:37,751 --> 00:44:38,831
Feel the burn.

736
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,218
- Here!
- Thank you.

737
00:44:57,298 --> 00:44:59,337
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

738
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:00,496
Elliot?

739
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:02,335
You have to hide.
She can't know you're here.

740
00:45:02,415 --> 00:45:03,414
- Where?
- Here!

741
00:45:03,494 --> 00:45:05,893
- No! Where should I hide?
- Under the bed!

742
00:45:06,532 --> 00:45:08,051
Did you hear that?

743
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:15,286
- Elliot?
- Just a sec, hon.

744
00:45:21,162 --> 00:45:23,601
Honey, are you in the bathroom?

745
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,479
- Oh, my.
- What?

746
00:45:28,877 --> 00:45:30,276
My God!

747
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,273
Elliot, did you fill out
your questionnaire?

748
00:45:34,353 --> 00:45:36,792
My questionnaire?

749
00:45:36,832 --> 00:45:40,629
Benson's wedding questionnaire.
I put it in your briefcase yesterday.

750
00:45:44,587 --> 00:45:47,864
That questionnaire. Yes. Of course.

751
00:45:47,984 --> 00:45:51,022
- Where is the questionnaire?
- It's in my briefcase.

752
00:45:51,142 --> 00:45:53,021
I filled it out after work...

753
00:45:53,421 --> 00:45:55,499
and I put it in my briefcase.

754
00:45:57,018 --> 00:46:00,136
See, look here's my questionnaire,
honey, all filled out.

755
00:46:00,816 --> 00:46:02,095
Okay, then.

756
00:46:02,175 --> 00:46:04,213
Now, let's start with the color scheme.

757
00:46:04,293 --> 00:46:07,171
The color scheme is the
foundation of the entire wedding.

758
00:46:07,251 --> 00:46:10,129
You go first, Elliot. I wanna see
if we put down the same thing for this.

759
00:46:10,209 --> 00:46:12,208
I put down...

760
00:46:13,847 --> 00:46:16,125
- yellow and black.
- Like a bumblebee?

761
00:46:16,725 --> 00:46:19,003
Oh! Buzz buzz.

762
00:46:19,683 --> 00:46:20,922
Or not.

763
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:24,720
Those were just options. I was really
curious to know what you put down.

764
00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:27,797
Well, my colors were Tuscan white bean
and steamed asparagus.

765
00:46:27,877 --> 00:46:31,155
But, really, Elliot, I'm shocked.

766
00:46:31,235 --> 00:46:33,034
- Yellow and black?
- Okay.

767
00:46:33,114 --> 00:46:36,871
You know what? Let's talk about what
kind of music you want at the reception.

768
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:38,670
Okay, music.

769
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:42,548
Yes, that's Elliot's forte.
So I defer 100 percent to him on this.

770
00:46:42,987 --> 00:46:45,466
- Funk.
- Are you insane, Elliot?

771
00:46:45,506 --> 00:46:49,943
Or jazz. Or swing. Or rock.
Or, I don't know.

772
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:53,980
It was a toss up for me between
jazz and rock and swing and funk.

773
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:56,938
You know what?
Let's forget about the music.

774
00:46:57,018 --> 00:46:59,376
Who's hungry? I'm hungry.
Let's talk about food?

775
00:46:59,456 --> 00:47:01,295
- That's a great idea.
- Fine.

776
00:47:01,934 --> 00:47:03,094
Food.

777
00:47:03,773 --> 00:47:04,853
Okay.

778
00:47:05,292 --> 00:47:08,610
Well, Elliot, I know we put down
the same thing for this one.

779
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,609
So, here we go.

780
00:47:11,288 --> 00:47:12,288
One...

781
00:47:13,367 --> 00:47:15,086
two, shout it out...

782
00:47:15,325 --> 00:47:16,405
three!

783
00:47:16,485 --> 00:47:18,244
- Baja cuisine!
- French food.

784
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:22,081
- What did you say?
- French food is a great idea, Caroline.

785
00:47:22,161 --> 00:47:25,479
- Did you say Baja cuisine?
- Is that what I said?

786
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:28,037
- What, may I ask, is Baja cuisine?
- Don't answer that.

787
00:47:28,117 --> 00:47:30,715
- It's beer-battered fish.
- Beer-battered fish.

788
00:47:31,155 --> 00:47:33,713
- I hate you!
- Okay.

789
00:47:33,793 --> 00:47:36,191
Let's do this later,
outside of Brooklyn.

790
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:40,668
No, wait. Mr. Hedges.
Mr. Hedges, please.

791
00:47:40,788 --> 00:47:42,387
Baja cuisine?

792
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:45,585
At my wedding?

793
00:47:45,586 --> 00:47:47,504
Benson Hedges, don't
leave me with her.

794
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:51,781
I'm not a marriage
counselor, Mr. Sherman.

795
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:55,259
I am a marriage maker. Good day to you.

796
00:48:05,252 --> 00:48:08,730
The questionnaire was blank, Elliot!
It was blank!

797
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,088
I can explain that.

798
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:14,765
- How could you do this to me?
- Wait!

799
00:48:14,805 --> 00:48:17,763
Sugar? Sweetie, are you there?

800
00:48:17,923 --> 00:48:20,082
Okay, now I have no idea where I am.

801
00:48:20,202 --> 00:48:22,200
Okay, taxi!

802
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,559
Darling.

803
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:27,637
Caroline, not in the bedroom!
Not in the bedroom!

804
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:32,314
- Oh, God!
- Oh, God is right, Elliot!

805
00:48:32,394 --> 00:48:36,111
You just completely lied to me!
I mean...

806
00:48:36,511 --> 00:48:40,148
- I can explain that!
- You can't explain this, Elliot!

807
00:48:40,228 --> 00:48:42,067
You knew how important
that questionnaire was...

808
00:48:42,107 --> 00:48:45,185
and you clearly
didn't even bother to look at it!

809
00:48:47,064 --> 00:48:48,943
Suck it in! Up!

810
00:48:49,102 --> 00:48:50,382
Suck it up?

811
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:54,539
Like this is somehow my fault?
Like I'm being unreasonable here?

812
00:48:56,857 --> 00:48:57,936
Ouch!

813
00:48:58,576 --> 00:49:00,535
I hope this hurts, Elliot!

814
00:49:00,615 --> 00:49:03,773
Because you have no idea
how badly this is hurting me!

815
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,529
I mean, we are getting married
and you don't even seem...

816
00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:11,447
to care about the wedding anymore!

817
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:15,884
Elliot...

818
00:49:19,722 --> 00:49:20,881
Enough!

819
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,839
Elliot...

820
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:26,717
ever since we drove
to my parents' house for dinner...

821
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,515
you have been acting like a maniac!

822
00:49:29,795 --> 00:49:33,193
You're possessive. You're paranoid.
You're forgetful.

823
00:49:33,672 --> 00:49:35,431
What happened to you?

824
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:40,548
Elliot, I am seeing a side of you
that I really don't like.

825
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:43,946
Don't bother walking me out!

826
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,301
What did you say?

827
00:49:53,299 --> 00:49:57,456
- You're not even gonna fight for me?
- Wait, Caroline!

828
00:49:58,056 --> 00:50:00,414
Caroline, wait.

829
00:50:02,213 --> 00:50:04,332
Caroline, please don't go!

830
00:50:04,412 --> 00:50:05,411
Elliot...

831
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:09,528
- I am calling off the wedding.
- You're what?

832
00:50:10,168 --> 00:50:13,685
I hate saying this but I don't think
we're meant to be together.

833
00:50:16,124 --> 00:50:17,243
It's over.

834
00:50:52,779 --> 00:50:54,178
Elliot...

835
00:50:55,577 --> 00:50:58,256
- I'm so sorry that this is happening.
- Cecil...

836
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:01,573
I think I just need to
be alone right now.

837
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:05,171
Okay. I understand.

838
00:51:10,927 --> 00:51:12,286
I'm so sorry.

839
00:51:24,718 --> 00:51:28,875
Darling, please call me
as soon as you get this.

840
00:51:33,512 --> 00:51:35,550
My God! Elliot!

841
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,628
I came as soon as I heard.

842
00:51:41,786 --> 00:51:43,865
And I brought along some cookies.

843
00:51:47,382 --> 00:51:49,901
What happened? Just tell me everything.

844
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,779
She called off the wedding.
That's what happened.

845
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,297
- Who's that girl?
- That's Stella's friend, Nadine.

846
00:51:55,337 --> 00:51:57,975
- Does she have a boyfriend?
- I don't think so.

847
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:03,072
Listen, Elliot, when's
the next time you

848
00:52:03,073 --> 00:52:05,210
and Caroline are supposed
to get together?

849
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:08,608
Tonight. My parents are having dinner
for the two families.

850
00:52:09,248 --> 00:52:10,607
Well, there you go!

851
00:52:10,647 --> 00:52:13,085
That's, like, 10 hours from now.
That gives her time...

852
00:52:13,165 --> 00:52:17,082
to get a little space, a little
perspective, a little dose of reality.

853
00:52:17,162 --> 00:52:18,921
I don't think she's even
gonna be there, Ed.

854
00:52:18,922 --> 00:52:20,680
I mean, she said it was over.

855
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,999
She'll be there. Quote me on that.

856
00:52:25,077 --> 00:52:28,954
Elliot, dear, Caroline was a nice girl.

857
00:52:29,034 --> 00:52:32,552
And we would've loved
for it to work out, but...

858
00:52:34,111 --> 00:52:37,868
Come to think of it,
we've liked all your girlfriends.

859
00:52:39,827 --> 00:52:41,946
But you know what they say?

860
00:52:42,905 --> 00:52:45,144
No, Mom, tell me, what do they say?

861
00:52:45,623 --> 00:52:46,783
Oh, well...

862
00:52:46,822 --> 00:52:48,941
there's other fish in the sea.

863
00:52:49,021 --> 00:52:50,900
That's right, kiddo.

864
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:55,736
I heard that
Jim and Nancy Wasserman's girl, Tina...

865
00:52:57,016 --> 00:52:58,535
is on the slab again.

866
00:52:59,694 --> 00:53:01,613
She's a fresh catch!

867
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:08,088
So, Elliot...

868
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,426
we're really sorry
about what happened.

869
00:53:11,427 --> 00:53:13,604
Yeah, sorry.

870
00:53:14,964 --> 00:53:17,522
Sorry for what? I screwed up.

871
00:53:17,682 --> 00:53:19,760
I got what I deserved.

872
00:53:21,479 --> 00:53:23,878
We just thought you were our savior,
you know.

873
00:53:28,554 --> 00:53:30,673
- But, life goes on?
- It does.

874
00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:33,552
Sometimes I think if
I'd never met Cecil

875
00:53:33,553 --> 00:53:35,830
Mills none of this ever
would have happened.

876
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:39,027
- That's a big if.
- I don't know about that.

877
00:53:39,107 --> 00:53:42,505
Excuse me, did you say Cecil Mills?

878
00:53:43,504 --> 00:53:45,023
That's my girlfriend.

879
00:53:45,583 --> 00:53:47,182
- Really?
- Yeah.

880
00:53:47,741 --> 00:53:50,939
- Who are you?
- I'm Elliot Sherman.

881
00:53:51,899 --> 00:53:53,857
Nothing happened. I swear.

882
00:53:57,455 --> 00:53:59,454
Wait a minute! You're the Baxter!

883
00:53:59,534 --> 00:54:03,171
Cecil told me all about you.
It's nice to meet you!

884
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:07,528
- She did?
- Yeah. Cec and I share everything.

885
00:54:07,608 --> 00:54:08,807
We have no secrets.

886
00:54:08,887 --> 00:54:11,885
Thank you so much for letting her
crash at your place the other night.

887
00:54:11,925 --> 00:54:13,804
We had a bit of a lovers' spat.

888
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:16,882
- You know how that is, right?
- Right.

889
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,279
So what are you doing here?

890
00:54:21,479 --> 00:54:23,557
Well, you know me...

891
00:54:23,637 --> 00:54:27,954
guvnor, come on in for a bit
of the old lagers and...

892
00:54:28,034 --> 00:54:29,953
I'm just meeting
a friend of mine from college.

893
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:31,872
- What about you?
- Dan.

894
00:54:32,591 --> 00:54:34,710
Tallyho. There she is.

895
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:36,669
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's so weird.

896
00:54:36,749 --> 00:54:38,627
I was just talking about you.

897
00:54:39,427 --> 00:54:40,706
How long has it been
since I've seen you?

898
00:54:40,707 --> 00:54:41,585
Ages!

899
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:42,984
Yeah. At least.

900
00:54:43,064 --> 00:54:45,263
- Hey.
- Hey, sweets!

901
00:54:46,342 --> 00:54:49,660
- I'm official valet.
- Bradley, this is Dan.

902
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,058
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you, too.

903
00:54:52,658 --> 00:54:54,617
- College.
- Yeah.

904
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:58,574
Elliot?

905
00:55:00,533 --> 00:55:03,650
Get out of Dodge, Eeyore! What are
you doing here? I know this guy.

906
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:06,169
I'm just meeting up with some friends.

907
00:55:06,608 --> 00:55:10,726
- Elliot is friends with my little lady.
- No way. Where's Caroline?

908
00:55:10,886 --> 00:55:11,965
She...

909
00:55:12,045 --> 00:55:15,203
Why don't we grab some real estate?
Maybe pull up a table?

910
00:55:15,283 --> 00:55:18,401
- No, we couldn't possibly-
- Yeah! Definitely!

911
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,279
Yes, it's on.

912
00:55:21,478 --> 00:55:23,197
Pull up some real estate.

913
00:55:37,708 --> 00:55:40,026
"Very clever, Mr. Bond."

914
00:55:45,582 --> 00:55:46,741
James Bond.

915
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:48,740
Okay, I got one.

916
00:55:54,057 --> 00:55:56,575
I'm an electric man and...

917
00:55:57,974 --> 00:55:59,493
I've got to know this.

918
00:55:59,573 --> 00:56:01,891
All you people are working overtime

919
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:05,449
Wait till they get a load of me.

920
00:56:10,126 --> 00:56:11,285
But...

921
00:56:11,525 --> 00:56:14,483
- But...
- Don't brag yet.

922
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,478
The policy is not like that in China.

923
00:56:26,435 --> 00:56:29,313
- I think it's against the rules.
- I don't think so.

924
00:56:30,992 --> 00:56:33,830
I want to make a toast to my friend.

925
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:36,228
To Elliot and the bride-to-be.

926
00:56:37,347 --> 00:56:39,266
No. She left him.

927
00:56:41,145 --> 00:56:43,623
Just this morning. Walked out the door.

928
00:56:44,702 --> 00:56:46,461
Is that true, Elliot?

929
00:56:51,738 --> 00:56:53,057
Jesus.

930
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,375
Man, I'm sorry about...

931
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,732
- That's awful.
- Can you not be so...

932
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:05,888
Hang in here, bro.

933
00:57:08,566 --> 00:57:13,483
"Sweet dove, sweet dove
Never to return again"

934
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:20,239
Keats.

935
00:57:21,478 --> 00:57:22,477
That is...

936
00:57:23,037 --> 00:57:26,514
so beautiful, Bradley,
the way you said that.

937
00:57:26,754 --> 00:57:30,512
I need to get out of here.
I need some fresh air. I'm sorry.

938
00:57:32,151 --> 00:57:34,029
Elliot, don't.

939
00:57:39,386 --> 00:57:41,224
- It's your go.
- Yeah.

940
00:57:43,623 --> 00:57:45,222
"I get no respect at all."

941
00:57:54,855 --> 00:57:57,014
What's the point, anyway?

942
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:02,370
I hate my life.

943
00:58:08,726 --> 00:58:10,844
I just want to die.

944
00:58:16,081 --> 00:58:17,840
Goodbye, cruel world.

945
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,558
Elliot! Elliot, wait!

946
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:22,117
Elliot!

947
00:58:22,996 --> 00:58:24,675
Man!

948
00:58:29,312 --> 00:58:30,311
Oh, boy.

949
00:58:30,431 --> 00:58:33,229
- What are you doing here, Louis?
- I was looking for you.

950
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:35,028
Caroline sent me. She's worried.

951
00:58:35,068 --> 00:58:36,947
- Caroline worried?
- Yeah.

952
00:58:37,027 --> 00:58:40,265
She's staying with us tonight.
She didn't want to be alone.

953
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,578
You know, you really
scared the crap out of me, man.

954
00:58:51,097 --> 00:58:53,616
So, what'd you do? You get the...
You went for the 40?

955
00:58:55,335 --> 00:58:58,972
Yeah, don't get me started
on my college days.

956
00:59:00,851 --> 00:59:02,770
Put away one of these myself.

957
00:59:03,049 --> 00:59:04,568
Man.

958
00:59:04,648 --> 00:59:06,307
Elliot, I know what
you're going through.

959
00:59:06,308 --> 00:59:07,966
I really do.

960
00:59:08,246 --> 00:59:09,205
I really do.

961
00:59:09,685 --> 00:59:11,724
Being married to a Swann girl
is no easy task.

962
00:59:11,803 --> 00:59:13,922
I'm the one who knows.
I'm the only other one who knows...

963
00:59:14,002 --> 00:59:16,880
'cause I'm married
to the only other Swann girl, Kate.

964
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,959
I mean...

965
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:19,358
let me tell you...

966
00:59:19,438 --> 00:59:22,556
I remember what it was like when Kate
and I were first getting married.

967
00:59:22,636 --> 00:59:25,914
We drove up to this dog breeder
and I don't even like dogs.

968
00:59:25,954 --> 00:59:27,953
And I went anyway. And what happens?

969
00:59:27,993 --> 00:59:31,790
Of course, the dog bites me,
in the leg and the face.

970
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:35,827
It's like, God damn it, girl.
What are you trying to do to me?

971
00:59:36,307 --> 00:59:40,024
I mean, look, Kate and I,
we've been through our ups and downs.

972
00:59:40,104 --> 00:59:41,903
I'm not talking about our trip
to Cedar Point...

973
00:59:41,983 --> 00:59:44,781
when we went on the roller coaster.
But I'm kidding about that.

974
00:59:44,861 --> 00:59:48,139
It's like, Johnny Carson, you know?

975
00:59:48,219 --> 00:59:51,377
But one time we go to
this banana factory.

976
00:59:51,617 --> 00:59:53,096
And I'm, like, sure, I'll go with her.

977
00:59:53,176 --> 00:59:55,654
And then we get there
and, of course, no, no bananas.

978
00:59:55,694 --> 00:59:58,012
- Bananas aren't even manufactured-
- Louis!

979
00:59:58,332 --> 01:00:00,451
What are you talking about?

980
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:03,489
She left me, okay! It's over!

981
01:00:04,888 --> 01:00:06,127
I blew it!

982
01:00:07,606 --> 01:00:09,005
Maybe not.

983
01:00:10,564 --> 01:00:13,162
She's willing to consider
a reconciliation, Elliot.

984
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:15,800
- She is?
- But you can't screw it up.

985
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,539
You've got to take her
out to a nice dinner.

986
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,198
Sweep her off her feet.

987
01:00:19,278 --> 01:00:21,397
Go to the park. Swimming maybe.

988
01:00:21,477 --> 01:00:24,595
Scrabble. Horseback riding.

989
01:00:24,674 --> 01:00:27,592
Or skinny-dipping. A rondelet.

990
01:00:27,672 --> 01:00:29,991
You could take her
to a rondelet or an opera.

991
01:00:30,071 --> 01:00:32,269
Whatever she likes, you got to do it.

992
01:00:32,349 --> 01:00:35,347
You can do it, Elliot. You can do this.

993
01:00:36,227 --> 01:00:38,545
- Okay?
- Okay.

994
01:00:39,345 --> 01:00:40,304
Okay.

995
01:00:41,143 --> 01:00:42,662
I have faith in you, man.

996
01:00:42,742 --> 01:00:45,141
You're my brother,
my brother-in-law, to-be...

997
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:47,939
in a few weeks. Or whenever it is.

998
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,576
You're gonna be fine.

999
01:00:54,974 --> 01:00:57,412
- Hell of a view, huh?
- Yeah.

1000
01:01:05,607 --> 01:01:07,446
So that's exactly what I did.

1001
01:01:07,486 --> 01:01:10,644
I went to Caroline's apartment
to sweep her off her feet.

1002
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,519
Elliot.

1003
01:01:18,838 --> 01:01:22,396
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too, Caroline.

1004
01:01:23,275 --> 01:01:27,112
- These are for you.
- Flowers. Elliot, how sweet.

1005
01:01:27,352 --> 01:01:30,390
- And these.
- And candies.

1006
01:01:32,309 --> 01:01:33,508
Come in.

1007
01:01:40,104 --> 01:01:43,062
Elliot, there's something really
important I need to discuss with you.

1008
01:01:43,102 --> 01:01:45,460
Caroline, I want to apologize
for what happened yesterday.

1009
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,579
- I was totally-
- Bradley's here.

1010
01:01:47,779 --> 01:01:48,818
What?

1011
01:01:51,296 --> 01:01:52,575
Hey, buddy.

1012
01:01:53,095 --> 01:01:54,254
What's he doing here?

1013
01:01:54,334 --> 01:01:56,653
I know this isn't what we had planned,
and I'm really sorry.

1014
01:01:56,733 --> 01:01:57,992
But he just broke up
with his girlfriend.

1015
01:01:57,993 --> 01:01:59,051
Sonya?

1016
01:01:59,131 --> 01:02:00,690
He seemed so stranded.

1017
01:02:00,810 --> 01:02:03,848
I invited him out to dinner.
I didn't know what else to do.

1018
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,747
Bradley, you broke up
with your girlfriend?

1019
01:02:05,748 --> 01:02:07,565
Yeah.

1020
01:02:08,405 --> 01:02:10,763
Just wasn't our destiny to be together.

1021
01:02:11,842 --> 01:02:13,801
- But she seemed so nice.
- Yeah.

1022
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,437
Look, Elliot, I know this isn't the
best time for me to be here right now.

1023
01:02:19,477 --> 01:02:21,436
But I didn't want to be alone.

1024
01:02:21,836 --> 01:02:24,674
What do you say, Ell? Can he tag along?

1025
01:02:26,473 --> 01:02:28,231
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

1026
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:32,588
Glad that's settled.
I'll just put these in some water.

1027
01:02:33,228 --> 01:02:36,306
These flowers are bulky, Elliot.

1028
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:39,544
They're quite muscular, really.

1029
01:02:39,584 --> 01:02:41,422
Did you buy them at the gym?

1030
01:02:43,381 --> 01:02:45,580
No. I got them at...

1031
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:47,378
I must be allergic.

1032
01:02:47,818 --> 01:02:50,576
You know what? I'm just gonna
take them to work with me.

1033
01:02:50,616 --> 01:02:52,815
They'd be perfect for this
dank little storage room...

1034
01:02:52,855 --> 01:02:56,932
we have in the basement where we keep
the paper clips and the toaster oven.

1035
01:02:57,692 --> 01:02:59,890
What's that flower there? Is it new?

1036
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:01,649
Bradley gave it to me.

1037
01:03:01,689 --> 01:03:04,887
- He... You did?
- Yeah, it's a bluebonnet.

1038
01:03:05,766 --> 01:03:10,003
I found it fighting its way
through a little slab of city sidewalk.

1039
01:03:12,162 --> 01:03:14,080
It goes with Caroline's eyes.

1040
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:18,158
- Very thoughtful of you, Bradley.
- Yeah.

1041
01:03:18,518 --> 01:03:20,156
And these candies we
can just take with us.

1042
01:03:20,236 --> 01:03:22,755
I'll give them to a homeless man
since I'm not eating chocolate.

1043
01:03:22,795 --> 01:03:24,434
Since when do you
not eat chocolate, Caroline?

1044
01:03:24,513 --> 01:03:27,152
- I'm watching my weight.
- I'm watching it, too.

1045
01:03:27,951 --> 01:03:28,950
You!

1046
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:36,545
Well, I made us a reservation
for two at Chez Pierre.

1047
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:40,223
I should probably call ahead and see
about them adding another person.

1048
01:03:40,303 --> 01:03:42,022
If you two will excuse me.

1049
01:03:48,138 --> 01:03:51,575
Chez Pierre is a little outdated.

1050
01:03:51,775 --> 01:03:54,573
Elliot. He's not up on the trends.

1051
01:03:56,652 --> 01:04:00,130
- You feeling better?
- Yeah, better now.

1052
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:07,884
So I spoke to the maitre d'
over at Chez Pierre...

1053
01:04:07,964 --> 01:04:11,002
and he informed me, unfortunately,
they could not find any extra chairs.

1054
01:04:11,082 --> 01:04:13,560
They looked everywhere.
Bradley, I'm sorry.

1055
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:19,596
Elliot, I hope you don't think we're
going to allow Bradley to dine alone?

1056
01:04:19,676 --> 01:04:21,155
What do you want me to do, Caroline?

1057
01:04:21,235 --> 01:04:23,194
They looked everywhere
and couldn't find any extra...

1058
01:04:23,274 --> 01:04:26,352
Hey, I have an idea. I
know a place nearby.

1059
01:04:26,432 --> 01:04:30,189
It's a great little burger joint.
Totally off the map, never crowded.

1060
01:04:30,629 --> 01:04:32,188
And it's a real gem if you ask me.

1061
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:34,107
- That sounds perfect.
- Great.

1062
01:04:35,546 --> 01:04:38,584
If that's okay with Elliot?
What say you, Ell?

1063
01:04:38,664 --> 01:04:39,823
What say I?

1064
01:04:40,422 --> 01:04:43,620
If it's the same little burger joint
off the map that I'm thinking of...

1065
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:46,179
that's quite a gem, then I feel
like it's a very good choice.

1066
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:48,137
- Great!
- All right!

1067
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:49,656
I'll lead the way.

1068
01:04:53,174 --> 01:04:55,252
I'll get the door for you, honey.

1069
01:04:57,691 --> 01:04:59,649
Thanks, Bradley. Grab my jacket.

1070
01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:08,963
- There she is.
- Bradley.

1071
01:05:10,162 --> 01:05:12,201
- It's been a long time.
- Yeah.

1072
01:05:12,281 --> 01:05:14,360
Delores, Caroline. Caroline, Delores.

1073
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,558
- Hi.
- Hello. Pleased to meet you.

1074
01:05:16,838 --> 01:05:19,476
- Hi, Delores.
- What are you doing here?

1075
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:22,354
Wow.

1076
01:05:26,352 --> 01:05:29,030
This place is perfect, Bradley.

1077
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:31,468
Magical, cheap.

1078
01:05:33,547 --> 01:05:35,905
Elliot, I can't believe
you never told me about this place.

1079
01:05:35,985 --> 01:05:38,303
I'm sorry, hon. I eat here all the time.

1080
01:05:38,383 --> 01:05:40,102
I just didn't think you'd like it.

1081
01:05:40,142 --> 01:05:43,020
- Know what you'd like to order?
- Yeah, I'm gonna have...

1082
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,578
Actually, Delores, I'd like to
take a look at the menu first.

1083
01:05:46,658 --> 01:05:51,135
If you'll recall from the other times
you've eaten here...

1084
01:05:51,215 --> 01:05:52,734
we've got no menu.

1085
01:05:53,094 --> 01:05:56,331
You've got a choice of hamburger,
cheeseburger, fries or coleslaw...

1086
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,930
or all four if you're really hungry.

1087
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:01,788
Okay, good. I'll just take
a second to think it over.

1088
01:06:01,789 --> 01:06:03,886
Why don't you guys order?

1089
01:06:03,966 --> 01:06:06,165
Cheeseburger, Delores.
Extra, extra rare.

1090
01:06:06,245 --> 01:06:07,964
That a boy, Bradley.

1091
01:06:08,123 --> 01:06:10,442
Oh, what the hell, I'll have the same.

1092
01:06:10,482 --> 01:06:14,439
And bring some office supplies,
because I might as well just tape it on.

1093
01:06:15,279 --> 01:06:17,437
Wait, Caroline,
I thought you were watching your weight.

1094
01:06:17,517 --> 01:06:20,075
Honey, don't be such a
stickler for details.

1095
01:06:20,395 --> 01:06:24,632
So that's two cheeseburgers extra rare.
Do we have enough for a quorum?

1096
01:06:24,712 --> 01:06:27,750
No, actually, Delores,
I'm gonna have just the hamburger.

1097
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:31,068
No cheese because I'm
lactose intolerant.

1098
01:06:31,148 --> 01:06:33,426
And I'll get it cooked well done.

1099
01:06:33,626 --> 01:06:36,225
- Crispy, in fact.
- Okay.

1100
01:06:36,304 --> 01:06:39,023
And can I get you all
something to drink?

1101
01:06:39,222 --> 01:06:43,060
- Yes, I'm gonna have-
- I'll order the drinks.

1102
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,138
- If that's okay with you, Brad?
- Sure.

1103
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:52,214
Delores, we will have a bottle
of your very finest red wine.

1104
01:06:52,374 --> 01:06:56,851
An Acorn Creek pinot noir 2002
would be preferable.

1105
01:06:57,170 --> 01:07:00,928
Caroline, when she brings the wine,
notice the beefy, meat...

1106
01:07:02,167 --> 01:07:04,965
complexion and the fruit.

1107
01:07:05,205 --> 01:07:07,004
So, anyway, we'll have that.

1108
01:07:07,244 --> 01:07:09,082
Or if you don't mind, sir...

1109
01:07:09,162 --> 01:07:13,000
perhaps you'll settle for
our list of beers...

1110
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:17,037
as we are an ale house
and it's all we've got.

1111
01:07:22,114 --> 01:07:25,032
Yes. That sounds good.

1112
01:07:25,711 --> 01:07:29,149
Bradley, perhaps you'd like to choose
one of the beers as I'm not...

1113
01:07:29,229 --> 01:07:32,027
as particularly well-educated
in that type of...

1114
01:07:34,785 --> 01:07:38,942
While you're deciding on what to drink,
I'll just go put in your food order.

1115
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:45,178
You guys, I'm gonna go
use the men's room.

1116
01:07:52,253 --> 01:07:56,011
Maybe he confused this place
with someplace else.

1117
01:08:35,984 --> 01:08:38,502
Hi, it's Cecil Mills.
Leave a message. Bye.

1118
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:42,500
Hi, Cecil, it's me, Elliot Sherman.

1119
01:08:45,138 --> 01:08:47,736
Probably wondering why I'm calling you.

1120
01:08:48,855 --> 01:08:50,934
Well, I'm just calling to say hi.

1121
01:08:51,853 --> 01:08:53,932
Just wanted to check in.

1122
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:58,929
I'm calling you right
now from a restaurant.

1123
01:08:59,808 --> 01:09:01,887
I was supposed
to be out on a big romantic date.

1124
01:09:01,966 --> 01:09:06,563
My fiancee, Caroline,
she decided to bring Bradley with us.

1125
01:09:08,122 --> 01:09:11,280
As you can imagine,
I'm not very happy about that.

1126
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:16,597
I think it's fair to say
my marriage is officially off.

1127
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:20,754
Why am I telling you this?

1128
01:09:22,233 --> 01:09:26,390
You're probably out with Dan.
Anyway, Dan's a great guy.

1129
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:33,026
Yeah, so just calling to say hello.

1130
01:09:33,585 --> 01:09:35,224
See how you were doing.

1131
01:09:36,983 --> 01:09:38,862
Maybe I'll talk to you later.

1132
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,940
Okay, bye.

1133
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:06,803
- Cecil?
- Elliot.

1134
01:10:07,962 --> 01:10:09,401
What are you doing here?

1135
01:10:09,481 --> 01:10:11,999
Betty caught the flu
and I'm your temp again.

1136
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,716
It's funny how things
come full circle, isn't it?

1137
01:10:17,196 --> 01:10:18,755
I got your message.

1138
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:21,593
I'm so sorry, Elliot.
It just sounded awful.

1139
01:10:22,232 --> 01:10:26,150
So, I thought that maybe later after
work you and I could go to a bar...

1140
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:29,068
and make toasts
to how misery loves company.

1141
01:10:31,866 --> 01:10:33,105
It got better.

1142
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:36,343
- It did?
- Yeah.

1143
01:10:37,302 --> 01:10:38,382
My night...

1144
01:10:39,221 --> 01:10:40,460
it got better.

1145
01:10:42,619 --> 01:10:45,417
What a lovely dinner.
Don't you think so, Elliot?

1146
01:10:48,175 --> 01:10:51,213
- What should we do next?
- Let's go dancing.

1147
01:10:51,293 --> 01:10:53,411
There's a great little dance club
right around the corner.

1148
01:10:53,491 --> 01:10:56,250
- Yes! Elly, can we please?
- No!

1149
01:10:57,129 --> 01:10:59,048
Caroline, you and I really have to talk.

1150
01:10:59,128 --> 01:11:01,046
Elliot, you know how badly
I wanna go dancing.

1151
01:11:01,126 --> 01:11:03,605
- You are such a killjoy!
- That's not true!

1152
01:11:03,685 --> 01:11:05,523
Every party needs a pooper.

1153
01:11:05,603 --> 01:11:09,561
I may regret saying this, Elliot,
but you are so unromantic!

1154
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:12,519
- What?
- I said you're unromantic, Elliot!

1155
01:11:12,838 --> 01:11:14,317
I'm unromantic?

1156
01:11:15,077 --> 01:11:16,516
I'm unromantic?

1157
01:11:17,515 --> 01:11:20,313
That is just a very tough pill
for me to swallow right now...

1158
01:11:20,393 --> 01:11:24,790
because I have been trying my absolute
hardest all night long to be romantic!

1159
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:28,828
But nothing, and I mean nothing,
is good enough for you, Caroline!

1160
01:11:28,908 --> 01:11:30,786
I bought you flowers,
they were too bulky!

1161
01:11:30,866 --> 01:11:32,565
I got us a reservation at the best

1162
01:11:32,566 --> 01:11:34,264
restaurant in town,
but it was too fancy!

1163
01:11:34,344 --> 01:11:36,622
I foolishly ordered wine
with the cheeseburgers...

1164
01:11:36,702 --> 01:11:39,980
and now I'm the bad guy
because I don't want to go dancing!

1165
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:43,698
- Elliot, I'm sorry.
- No! No, I'm sorry, Caroline!

1166
01:11:44,257 --> 01:11:47,655
I'm sorry that I'm too unromantic! And
I'm sorry that I always play it safe!

1167
01:11:47,695 --> 01:11:51,093
But the fact of the matter is
I'm not Bradley! I'm Elliot!

1168
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:54,011
I'm Elliot Sherman and I'm proud of it!

1169
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:57,209
And the fact of the matter is
I'm trying very hard to change...

1170
01:11:57,289 --> 01:11:59,047
but, Caroline, I'm not perfect!

1171
01:11:59,127 --> 01:12:01,606
I'm not perfect
and I don't expect you to be, either!

1172
01:12:01,686 --> 01:12:05,043
So all I ask is that you
just give me a break!

1173
01:12:06,602 --> 01:12:08,201
Just give me a break.

1174
01:12:16,596 --> 01:12:17,595
Now...

1175
01:12:18,274 --> 01:12:20,193
if you'll both excuse me...

1176
01:12:20,273 --> 01:12:24,031
I've changed my mind and I've decided
I would now like to go dancing.

1177
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:26,549
- Ell!
- Elliot.

1178
01:12:31,505 --> 01:12:34,743
- You're dancing, Elliot!
- Yeah!

1179
01:12:34,823 --> 01:12:38,940
- The bar mitzvah shuffle! Not bad, huh?
- Not bad at all.

1180
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:41,059
Caroline, look at me!

1181
01:12:45,656 --> 01:12:48,814
- Bradley was a breakdancer.
- Cool!

1182
01:12:49,773 --> 01:12:53,890
I used to have my own crew, Sergeant
Poppers and The Bionic Breakers!

1183
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:56,009
Careful, man.

1184
01:12:56,569 --> 01:12:58,407
Elliot, we should have a battle, man.

1185
01:12:58,487 --> 01:13:01,445
- That'd be so fun! Let's do it!
- No, that's okay.

1186
01:13:01,485 --> 01:13:03,564
Come on, Elliot!

1187
01:13:03,724 --> 01:13:05,523
- I'll start it off!
- All right!

1188
01:13:05,603 --> 01:13:07,641
Oh, yeah.

1189
01:13:11,519 --> 01:13:13,597
- You go.
- It's your turn. Go.

1190
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:15,316
Okay.

1191
01:13:18,074 --> 01:13:19,073
Elliot!

1192
01:13:21,992 --> 01:13:25,389
- You have so many great moves!
- Yeah, I do!

1193
01:13:27,228 --> 01:13:30,866
That was fun. I'm gonna go get
another drink. You guys want something?

1194
01:13:30,946 --> 01:13:32,225
- No, I'm good.
- All right.

1195
01:13:32,265 --> 01:13:35,502
What are you talking about, man?
The battle's not over!

1196
01:13:35,582 --> 01:13:39,460
Come on, I'm gonna do a windmill.
Difficulty level 6.0.

1197
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,898
Clear out, everybody. Clear out.

1198
01:13:42,098 --> 01:13:44,177
Ready? Here goes.

1199
01:13:46,575 --> 01:13:48,374
That's great!

1200
01:13:54,969 --> 01:13:57,648
Elliot!

1201
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:02,604
- My gosh! Are you all right?
- What happened?

1202
01:14:03,524 --> 01:14:06,002
My God, Elliot, that
was so stupid of me.

1203
01:14:08,121 --> 01:14:11,039
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

1204
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:13,077
I was just trying to have fun.

1205
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:15,476
Bradley, let's just talk tomorrow
or something...

1206
01:14:15,555 --> 01:14:17,274
so I can get Elliot cleaned up here.
Okay?

1207
01:14:17,354 --> 01:14:18,434
Yeah.

1208
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:23,710
Except the thing is,
I didn't mention this before but...

1209
01:14:24,589 --> 01:14:26,308
I'm leaving town tomorrow.

1210
01:14:26,548 --> 01:14:28,187
- What?
- Yeah.

1211
01:14:28,267 --> 01:14:33,104
The team I'm working with found this
massive geode in this cave in Malta.

1212
01:14:33,703 --> 01:14:35,502
I kind of need to be there.

1213
01:14:36,142 --> 01:14:39,020
Oh, that's too bad.

1214
01:14:39,579 --> 01:14:41,998
Yeah, it's kind of bad
timing, I know, but

1215
01:14:41,999 --> 01:14:44,416
Mother Nature makes
up her own schedule.

1216
01:14:45,415 --> 01:14:49,173
Besides, there's nothing really
keeping me here anymore, right?

1217
01:14:51,691 --> 01:14:52,770
Right.

1218
01:14:54,449 --> 01:14:57,687
Anyway, it's probably gonna be
my last cave.

1219
01:14:58,247 --> 01:15:01,285
I mean, I wanna try something else,
try something new. I don't know what.

1220
01:15:01,365 --> 01:15:04,123
It may be medicine, it may be soccer.
I don't know.

1221
01:15:04,203 --> 01:15:06,681
I haven't even got my
head around it yet.

1222
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,399
Well, it was good seeing you again.

1223
01:15:11,238 --> 01:15:14,196
Yeah. Good seeing you, too.

1224
01:15:16,674 --> 01:15:17,914
Okay.

1225
01:15:20,032 --> 01:15:21,031
Okay.

1226
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:24,029
Right.

1227
01:15:25,828 --> 01:15:26,788
Right.

1228
01:15:28,626 --> 01:15:29,626
Bye.

1229
01:15:33,103 --> 01:15:34,063
Bye.

1230
01:15:36,021 --> 01:15:40,298
- Take care, elbow macaroni.
- Bye, Bradley.

1231
01:15:51,491 --> 01:15:53,450
I guess you really swept
her off her feet, huh?

1232
01:15:53,451 --> 01:15:55,408
Congratulations, Elliot.

1233
01:15:56,248 --> 01:16:00,045
- I guess you're not a Baxter after all.
- I guess not.

1234
01:16:01,684 --> 01:16:03,483
Well, that makes one of us.

1235
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,039
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

1236
01:16:10,518 --> 01:16:13,356
No? Okay, well...

1237
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,553
I got to go.

1238
01:16:20,112 --> 01:16:23,390
- Where you gonna go?
- I think I'd like to find Dan.

1239
01:16:24,349 --> 01:16:25,308
Why?

1240
01:16:26,068 --> 01:16:28,427
Because Dan got a job
in Cincinnati, Elliot.

1241
01:16:28,428 --> 01:16:30,785
And he's leaving on Saturday.

1242
01:16:31,904 --> 01:16:34,182
I guess that means that I won't be
able to make your wedding.

1243
01:16:34,262 --> 01:16:36,141
But that's okay, you're
registered, right?

1244
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:39,299
I'll get you a something.
I'll get you a waffle maker.

1245
01:16:40,018 --> 01:16:44,975
He wanted me to go with him,
but I was holding out for some reason.

1246
01:16:47,293 --> 01:16:49,012
You don't want Dan.

1247
01:16:49,092 --> 01:16:51,770
Well, something is better
than nothing, Elliot.

1248
01:16:54,089 --> 01:16:56,927
But what about singing, Cecil?
What about that?

1249
01:16:57,966 --> 01:17:00,165
They have singing in Cincinnati, too.

1250
01:17:01,084 --> 01:17:02,803
Good luck with everything.

1251
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:12,516
Which brings us all the way back
to the beginning...

1252
01:17:13,516 --> 01:17:16,194
or the ending,
depending on how you look at it.

1253
01:17:16,354 --> 01:17:20,631
But it's just like Cecil said: "It's
funny how things come full circle."

1254
01:17:21,271 --> 01:17:25,108
- Here you are, buddy. You made it.
- Yeah.

1255
01:17:26,987 --> 01:17:28,066
Yeah.

1256
01:17:31,544 --> 01:17:34,062
- He looks so handsome.
- He does, doesn't he?

1257
01:17:35,341 --> 01:17:38,099
I mean, this is what I've always
wanted my whole entire life.

1258
01:17:38,179 --> 01:17:40,178
This is what I've always wanted.

1259
01:17:41,137 --> 01:17:43,416
Now I'm actually doing it.

1260
01:17:44,775 --> 01:17:46,733
- It's great, buddy.
- So great.

1261
01:17:47,613 --> 01:17:48,612
Yeah.

1262
01:18:19,192 --> 01:18:20,950
Please be seated.

1263
01:18:24,188 --> 01:18:25,747
Good afternoon.

1264
01:18:26,147 --> 01:18:29,465
We are gathered here today
to join these two people...

1265
01:18:29,864 --> 01:18:31,823
in holy matrimony.

1266
01:18:32,263 --> 01:18:35,461
Elliot Sherman and Caroline Swann.

1267
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:40,777
If anyone whosoever should object
to these two people being married...

1268
01:18:41,097 --> 01:18:45,214
please speak now
or forever hold your peace.

1269
01:18:47,413 --> 01:18:49,731
- Caroline.
- Elliot?

1270
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:52,089
Caroline!

1271
01:18:53,768 --> 01:18:54,768
Bradley!

1272
01:18:54,848 --> 01:18:56,806
I'm going to business school.

1273
01:18:57,686 --> 01:18:58,685
Bradley!

1274
01:18:59,724 --> 01:19:01,923
I got on a plane
and I flew all the way back to Malta.

1275
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:03,402
But then I realized something.

1276
01:19:03,482 --> 01:19:06,800
I realized that no matter
how exciting my life is...

1277
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,358
it's dull if you're not a part of it.

1278
01:19:09,718 --> 01:19:12,995
And I realized that it was wrong
for me to ask you to be...

1279
01:19:13,395 --> 01:19:15,394
who I wanted you to be.

1280
01:19:15,953 --> 01:19:19,351
When all along I never
wanted you to be...

1281
01:19:19,431 --> 01:19:23,828
the person that I wanted you to be
but me to be with you.

1282
01:19:25,387 --> 01:19:26,386
Us.

1283
01:19:27,146 --> 01:19:28,105
Me.

1284
01:19:28,505 --> 01:19:29,704
Together.

1285
01:19:30,184 --> 01:19:32,822
Caroline, I'm asking you
for another chance...

1286
01:19:33,821 --> 01:19:35,780
to be the man that I never was before.

1287
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:40,777
One who can provide a safe
and secure environment...

1288
01:19:41,736 --> 01:19:43,455
where we can settle down.

1289
01:19:47,452 --> 01:19:48,931
What do say, Carrie?

1290
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:52,449
Oh, Bradley!

1291
01:20:06,959 --> 01:20:09,637
Bradley and Caroline
lived happily ever after.

1292
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:13,475
But like I said, this
movie isn't about them.

1293
01:20:14,154 --> 01:20:15,234
It's about me.

1294
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:23,388
Cecil! Wait!

1295
01:21:25,107 --> 01:21:26,346
Cecil!

1296
01:21:33,301 --> 01:21:34,300
No.

1297
01:21:45,972 --> 01:21:47,332
You're late.

1298
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:52,168
- Cecil.
- Elliot.

1299
01:21:53,487 --> 01:21:54,886
What are you doing here?

1300
01:21:54,926 --> 01:21:57,964
Remember when I said
that they had singing in Cincinnati?

1301
01:21:58,044 --> 01:21:59,324
I lied.

1302
01:22:02,122 --> 01:22:03,840
What's your excuse?

1303
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,598
Cecil, I realized that Caroline
and I aren't meant to be together.

1304
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:11,196
And I realized that I don't want you
to move to Cincinnati.

1305
01:22:11,675 --> 01:22:12,794
And I...

1306
01:22:12,874 --> 01:22:15,912
know that this might
sound a little bit crazy...

1307
01:22:17,351 --> 01:22:20,789
but I think I fell in love with you
the minute I first saw you.

1308
01:22:27,904 --> 01:22:29,223
Cecil?

1309
01:22:29,543 --> 01:22:30,902
Cecil Mills?

1310
01:22:31,142 --> 01:22:33,860
It's me Jack Mechanic!
Remember from semester at sea?

1311
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:38,537
- You!
- Take it easy!

1312
01:22:43,014 --> 01:22:44,533
Sorry about that. I just...

1313
01:22:52,768 --> 01:22:56,245
- By the way I got you something.
- Is that what I think it is?

1314
01:22:56,885 --> 01:22:59,803
- It's a gromwell.
- Thank you.

1315
01:23:00,762 --> 01:23:02,441
You're welcome.

1316
01:23:14,753 --> 01:23:16,871
So that's the end of my story.

1317
01:23:17,311 --> 01:23:20,349
But for every guy out there
who's been splashed by a taxi...

1318
01:23:20,429 --> 01:23:24,346
dumped by a girl or who's just
a little out of step with the world...

1319
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:25,506
Hi.

1320
01:23:25,585 --> 01:23:26,585
There's hope.

1321
01:23:26,665 --> 01:23:28,504
This is a song that I wrote.

1322
01:26:43,173 --> 01:26:46,330
Imagine you're watching
one of those old romantic movies.

1323
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:49,288
That's Cecil, the leading lady.

1324
01:26:51,007 --> 01:26:53,366
That's Elliot, the leading man.

1325
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:55,324
Cecil!

1326
01:26:55,884 --> 01:26:59,761
And that's me, Dan, the Baxter.

1327
01:30:37,375 --> 01:30:38,774
No.

1328
01:30:39,054 --> 01:30:42,611
He wasn't a medicine man.
He was more like a shaman.

1329
01:30:43,811 --> 01:30:46,489
And he asked me back to his house
which was a very sort of...

1330
01:30:46,569 --> 01:30:48,128
a holy place in the earth.

1331
01:30:48,368 --> 01:30:52,165
We traveled many miles and when
we got back there and he gave me a...

1332
01:30:52,885 --> 01:30:54,963
It was like a paste that you eat.

1333
01:30:55,123 --> 01:30:57,601
And you hallucinate all
through the night...

1334
01:30:57,681 --> 01:31:01,159
and when you awake
you're very sort of...

1335
01:31:02,638 --> 01:31:04,037
freed or cleansed.
