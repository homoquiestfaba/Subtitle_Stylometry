1
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:57,607
There's some things
I never told you about Maria.

2
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:00,830
Save the details till
after the honeymoon, homeboy.

3
00:01:04,712 --> 00:01:06,375
She has some problems.

4
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,486
Daddy, I think there's a snap undone.
Would you take a look?

5
00:01:37,357 --> 00:01:39,506
I don't think so, honey.
Are you sure?

6
00:01:44,427 --> 00:01:46,021
I'm not feeling very well.

7
00:01:46,437 --> 00:01:49,071
Of course you don't. You're getting
married. Get used to it.

8
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:57,249
- Here we go.
- She's a bit compulsive.

9
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:01,512
Maybe I should say
compulsive and neurotic.

10
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:03,938
Yeah, I know. She's Maria.

11
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:06,884
She sleeps with a flyswatter.

12
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,141
Hell, if I looked like Maria,
I'd sleep with a bazooka.

13
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:13,676
So you guys got some issues.

14
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:16,102
It's called modern romance.

15
00:02:31,073 --> 00:02:33,638
If you need it, there's an ice chest
under your mother's seat.

16
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:38,974
I'm okay. I feel better now.

17
00:02:55,505 --> 00:02:57,168
Careful of your dress, dear.

18
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:03,927
She, uh... She cleans the house
twice a day on her day off.

19
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:06,560
Yeah, well, at least she works.

20
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:08,674
We get to go to all those
great magazine parties.

21
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,764
Hey, remember Claudia from
the "Elle" party? Oh, man.

22
00:03:13,596 --> 00:03:15,328
She's always locking
the bathroom door.

23
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:20,734
She gets suicidal
from time to time.

24
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:23,645
All women get suicidal
from time to time.

25
00:03:29,987 --> 00:03:31,547
God, I love her.

26
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,067
So how long have you
known all of this?

27
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:51,231
They just sort of creep up
on you, you know? One by one.

28
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:55,147
- And before you know it...
- I say, don't panic.

29
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,747
It's probably just a phase.

30
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,346
Yeah.

31
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,459
Yeah.

32
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:04,470
Here she is.

33
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,138
- You guys are awfully late.
- We're supposed to be late.

34
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:17,396
- Mom, you got my train?
- I got it, dear.

35
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:22,421
- Come on, Dottie.
- I still think that dress is too tight.

36
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:28,105
I require and charge you both as you
will answer on the Day ofJudgment...

37
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,263
when the secrets of all hearts
will be disclosed...

38
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:35,313
that if either of you know
any impediment...

39
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:39,125
why you may not be lawfully
joined together in matrimony...

40
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:41,516
do now confess it.

41
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:46,194
<i>How much do you love me?</i>

42
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,517
Oh, a thousand.

43
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:51,532
Only a thousand?
That's not very much.

44
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:55,933
I can even count to a thousand.
One, two, three, four...

45
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:58,775
Okay, a hundred thousand
million billion.

46
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:04,354
That's better.
We're gonna be late for Alfred.

47
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:08,235
Yeah, but I love the reason.
Besides, myJuliet...

48
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:11,355
wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

49
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:20,400
How much satisfaction
can'st thou get in 11 minutes?

50
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,143
I'll be nicer in therapy.

51
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,851
How about the issues
we were discussing last time?

52
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:37,416
Things are still the same.

53
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:41,193
He's not nice to my friends
or my parents.

54
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:45,560
He's cheap. He flirts,
and he has a terrible temper.

55
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:49,545
But I'm a loving,
tolerant woman, so...

56
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:53,357
Oh, that feels so good.

57
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:03,996
She keeps bugging me to build
another room on to the house.

58
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:07,740
- We don't have any money, so...
- It would, of course...

59
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:10,546
put his car out in the driveway
for a couple of months.

60
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:12,764
Okay, okay.

61
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:16,507
Yes. Yeah.

62
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:20,354
Oh, right there.
Right there. Yes.

63
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:24,235
Maria, why is this new addition
to the house so important to you?

64
00:06:24,929 --> 00:06:26,904
Because I wanna have a baby.

65
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:33,593
Go deeper.

66
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,855
With all this talk about a baby,
how's the sex?

67
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:42,360
You go first.

68
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,509
- You want me to?
- Sure. Why not?

69
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:49,846
Okay.

70
00:06:55,564 --> 00:06:57,227
I have a confession to make.

71
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:05,960
I fake my orgasms.

72
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,391
Oh! Oh! Oh!

73
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,896
- You what?
- I didn't wanna tell you.

74
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:17,258
I didn't want to hurt you.

75
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:21,590
You're telling me
you've never had an orgasm?

76
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:27,447
Not with you.

77
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:33,165
Joseph, it's important
you appreciate the risk...

78
00:07:33,684 --> 00:07:35,661
Maria's taking in
communicating this to you.

79
00:07:57,597 --> 00:07:59,261
Do you think
I'm a lousy lover?

80
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,345
Hmm?

81
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:17,143
I love you, you know.

82
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:22,271
Whoa!

83
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:24,248
Tell the balcony crew
those doors are in.

84
00:08:24,663 --> 00:08:27,054
Yo, Nick, you must have
fucked up big.

85
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,445
We is humbled by youse
royal presence, Sir Suits.

86
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:30,936
Relax, Carlos.

87
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:34,644
Yo, Nick, I go out on a limb to get
you this job, like I always do...

88
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:38,283
I wouldn't work without you,
Joseph, my white patron saint.

89
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,089
Well, thank you, Nick,
but the problem is...

90
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:43,862
we're about four months behind
after two months on the job.

91
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:46,982
You geniuses made the schedule.
I just took the job.

92
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:48,749
Hey, Nick, what's this?

93
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,106
Oh, yeah, go ahead, Tanner.
Take a look.

94
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,294
- Yeah?
- It's a little discovery of Carlos's.

95
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:59,354
- Every hour on the hour.
- Holy shit! Oh, man!

96
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:01,883
This is unbelievable.
You gotta check this out.

97
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,309
- This is unbelievable.
- Must be the redhead.

98
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,854
Oh, man. Mm-hmm!

99
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,597
Ooh!

100
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:15,711
You guys are perverts.

101
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:19,731
Are you kiddin'? This guy's
a national treasure. One of a kind.

102
00:09:20,563 --> 00:09:22,364
- Holy shit!
- What do you mean?

103
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:25,137
This guy has anywhere from four to
six women a day, one after the other.

104
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:28,221
And word has it he pleases
every one of'em.

105
00:09:28,811 --> 00:09:32,588
- Joseph, take a look.
- No, I can see just fine.

106
00:09:34,944 --> 00:09:36,712
Oh, my God!
Here comes another one.

107
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,297
I don't believe it. They just
passed each other and said hi.

108
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:46,277
They said hi to each other.

109
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:48,599
- Oh, Jesus.
- Tanner.

110
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:50,643
- Yeah?
- Let's check out the site.

111
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,416
All right, Joseph, I am. I am.

112
00:09:55,357 --> 00:09:57,574
- It's gotta be an implant.
- An implant?

113
00:09:58,129 --> 00:09:59,758
Yeah, an implant, you know.
A lot of guys got 'em.

114
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:01,733
It comes with a pump.

115
00:10:02,114 --> 00:10:04,020
You just pump it up,
and it just stays there...

116
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,100
you know,
whenever you need it.

117
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,802
- Sounds like a good idea.
- Yeah, I gotta talk to that guy.

118
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:11,783
That redhead was to die for.
Oh, man, I wanna die.

119
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:15,873
- Tanner?
- Yeah?

120
00:10:16,358 --> 00:10:17,987
Does Vicky have orgasms?

121
00:10:18,403 --> 00:10:20,586
- What?
- You know, does she...

122
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:24,156
Does she come when you're
doin' it, or does she fake it?

123
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:28,106
What? No!
Of course she has orgasms.

124
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,497
I mean, man, she goes crazy.

125
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,032
How do you know?
I mean, she could be fakin' it.

126
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,978
You can tell. I mean,
they quiver all over.

127
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:39,820
Believe me, they quiver all over
even when they're fakin' it.

128
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:45,781
Shut the fuck up, would ya?

129
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,439
Come on, Freddie,
you little bugger.

130
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:56,350
Would you help me
with my tie, sweetheart?

131
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:58,429
Out, baby. Get out.

132
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:01,202
Maria, we're gonna be late.

133
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:04,390
Freddie listened to me.
He just flew out the window.

134
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:06,643
How do you know it's a he?

135
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:08,861
Because it bugs me, darling,
so it must be a he.

136
00:11:13,193 --> 00:11:15,514
How do I look?
Do I have lipstick on my tooth?

137
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:17,663
Honey, every time
we come see your parents...

138
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,985
you obsess
over the way you look.

139
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,896
Is my dress, okay? Do I need
to pull it down or anything?

140
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:25,669
You look fine.
Did you hear me?

141
00:11:27,575 --> 00:11:29,481
Joseph, your tie is a mess.

142
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:36,967
Well, hello.
And how are the newlyweds?

143
00:11:37,486 --> 00:11:39,219
- Hi, Dottie.
- We've been married seven months.

144
00:11:39,635 --> 00:11:42,164
Yes, dear. Come on in.

145
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:45,457
Your father's
in the living room.

146
00:11:50,863 --> 00:11:52,804
- Joseph, what are we...
- Surprise!

147
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:05,800
I'd say she's excited.
What would you say, hmm?

148
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:09,612
On a scale of one to ten,
about a four.

149
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,003
Oh, my God!

150
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,573
- Martini time.
- Yeah.

151
00:12:16,023 --> 00:12:19,247
How are you?
Oh, my gosh! Look at you!

152
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:38,895
Why is it when we go to parties...

153
00:12:39,277 --> 00:12:41,044
I always have to track you down
with a homing device?

154
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:48,288
If you loved me, you'd get in
that British fantasy of yours...

155
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:50,505
and drive me to Vegas.

156
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:58,753
Okay, let's play
"If you love me, " shall we?

157
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:03,778
- Go on. You start.
- Okay.

158
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:08,388
If you loved me, you'd take me
to Paris on our second honeymoon.

159
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,462
If you loved me, you wouldn't miss
your appointments with Alfred.

160
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,374
You'd buy us a house
in Briarwood...

161
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:23,532
with a big pool
and a little froufrou dog.

162
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:30,602
And you would stop
rearranging my closets.

163
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,108
A baby girl...

164
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:37,187
and an air-conditioned garage...

165
00:13:37,637 --> 00:13:40,721
for my 1974 Ferrari
Daytona convertible.

166
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,508
- I love you, Maria.
- Shut up. It's still my turn.

167
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,697
It can always be
your turn, sweetheart.

168
00:13:50,216 --> 00:13:52,609
- Oh, baby, is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

169
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:00,787
It's your turn now.

170
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:03,074
Honey, that's enough.

171
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:05,570
Oh, we'll both know
when it's enough, darling.

172
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:12,743
Joseph, even though
I can't have an orgasm...

173
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,906
I still enjoy
making love to you.

174
00:14:30,313 --> 00:14:32,011
Sometimes I wonder
if he loves me.

175
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:41,056
I feel he always avoids me.
He never returns my calls.

176
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,794
His secretary, Connie,
is always apologizing for him.

177
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,908
That's not true.

178
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:49,166
- You're distorting things again.
- Just let me finish, okay?

179
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:55,577
Connie is embarrassed
every time I call...

180
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,587
because he won't
pick up the phone.

181
00:14:57,969 --> 00:14:59,909
She practically admits
you're avoiding me.

182
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,885
She calls seven
or eight times a day.

183
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,380
- Seven or eight?
- Yes, you do! And you embarrass me...

184
00:15:04,865 --> 00:15:06,944
in front of my secretary
and my associates.

185
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:10,029
Connie doesn't know
how to handle her because...

186
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,108
half the time you call,
you're hysterical.

187
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:14,741
I just need to connect with you
during the day, okay?

188
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:17,341
Just once or twice.
Is that too much to ask?

189
00:15:17,861 --> 00:15:21,014
Just listen to her, Joseph.
Just listen to what she's saying.

190
00:15:22,678 --> 00:15:23,960
You gotta be kidding me.

191
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:25,831
Why are you so afraid
of being close?

192
00:15:26,247 --> 00:15:28,326
Why in the hell are you
always focusing on me?

193
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,722
I'm just tryin' to do
my job, for Christ's sakes...

194
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,292
and all we ever do in here is
talk about her problems with me.

195
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:38,550
What I do, what I don't do,
who I am or who I'm not...

196
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,323
that she has an issue with.

197
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:55,116
I just... I can't handle it
when he gets so angry.

198
00:16:02,324 --> 00:16:04,161
Joseph,
what is it you want?

199
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:08,389
I want a good marriage...

200
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,067
a supportive wife.

201
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,474
And I wanna work
all these things out...

202
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,483
so that we can have the baby
that she wants so much.

203
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:22,874
Joseph, Maria's doing so much
better the past few months.

204
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:25,092
She's standing up for herself.
It's wonderful.

205
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:26,964
I know.

206
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:29,910
But she's still very fragile
with you at this point.

207
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:32,335
This kind of confrontation
can't work.

208
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:40,826
You're right. I know.

209
00:16:42,593 --> 00:16:45,192
It's just that I feel like I have
to stay on top of the situation...

210
00:16:45,816 --> 00:16:47,307
or it'll fall apart.

211
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,187
She'll fall apart.

212
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:05,432
Hello? Tanner!

213
00:17:05,882 --> 00:17:09,036
No. No, I'll meet you
at the site.

214
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:41,901
You got a sick patient here,
Alfred. I suggest we talk in private.

215
00:19:45,193 --> 00:19:47,065
Come here, Alfred.
I have a few questions for you.

216
00:19:47,515 --> 00:19:50,287
Joseph, what's going on here now?
You're scaring me.

217
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:52,540
That's good,
'cause you know what?

218
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:55,209
I'm not totally in control
of myself right now.

219
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,496
Sit down, Alfred.

220
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:10,665
What does the name
"Baltazar" mean to you?

221
00:20:16,557 --> 00:20:18,324
You're gonna tell me everything...

222
00:20:18,774 --> 00:20:20,957
and you're gonna start
with this doctor.

223
00:20:21,477 --> 00:20:23,349
Do you know him?
Did you refer her to him?

224
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,225
No, no.
I don't know him.

225
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,933
All I know is, he's a sex therapist
that practices on the edge of the law.

226
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:34,438
They tried to shut him down,
but nobody will testify against him.

227
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:36,933
Can you tell me
why she does this?

228
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,845
Forget the bullshit psycho-babble.
I need to understand!

229
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:49,063
All I can tell you, Joseph, is that
Maria exhibits most of the symptoms...

230
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,321
of what is called
a borderline personality.

231
00:20:54,158 --> 00:20:56,826
By that I mean
she has no real identity.

232
00:20:57,415 --> 00:21:01,331
She has to look outside of herself
for assurance, comfort, love.

233
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,772
She can find
no sustenance within.

234
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:16,337
- Shouldn't I have been told this?
- Oh, come on, Joseph.

235
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,115
You've witnessed this for years.
I mean, her heightened personality...

236
00:21:20,808 --> 00:21:22,853
her need for control
at any cost...

237
00:21:23,337 --> 00:21:25,486
the fly obsession,
the phone calls.

238
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,511
Joseph, you lived it.

239
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:32,660
You're the expert.

240
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:45,413
<i>Most borderlines
are incurable, Joseph. </i>

241
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,884
<i>They need to be
totally reparented. </i>

242
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:05,548
One of our construction sites
is on Hinton Street.

243
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:16,464
I know about Baltazar.

244
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:21,039
It's not what you think.

245
00:22:21,593 --> 00:22:23,604
Oh, really?
What is it then?

246
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:27,728
Do you come with Baltazar?
Is that why you go?

247
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:29,980
- To learn how to come?
- It's not about that.

248
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:32,094
Then what is it about?

249
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:37,327
You know what? You're a lie!
Our whole marriage is a lie.

250
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:40,515
- Fuck you.
- You wanna tell me why?

251
00:22:42,075 --> 00:22:43,773
I don't feel very close
to you right now.

252
00:22:44,189 --> 00:22:46,580
You don't feel very close
to me right now?

253
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,867
You're paying some guy
to fuck you...

254
00:22:49,283 --> 00:22:51,813
and you don't feel
very close to me right now?

255
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:54,828
- I'm your husband, for Christ's sakes...
- I don't care who you are.

256
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,498
The door is open.

257
00:23:49,342 --> 00:23:51,005
Come in. Sit down.

258
00:24:05,595 --> 00:24:08,194
- Listen...
- Ah, you must beJoseph.

259
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:12,456
I've been expecting you.
Maria's husband.

260
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:14,917
She's a very special woman.

261
00:24:18,451 --> 00:24:21,294
Look, I don't know who you are
or what you think you do...

262
00:24:21,952 --> 00:24:24,724
but I need you to do me a kind favor
and stay away from my wife.

263
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,126
- She's not a well woman.
- I agree.

264
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:31,448
That's why she came to see me.

265
00:24:33,977 --> 00:24:36,854
Someone would have to be very
disturbed to come here seeking health.

266
00:24:40,216 --> 00:24:42,053
You don't understand,
my friend.

267
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:46,696
You understand this, Dr. Fuck!

268
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:51,166
You stay away
from my wife, okay?

269
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:53,627
I know what goes on in here,
'cause I was here.

270
00:24:54,112 --> 00:24:57,197
And it wasn't love or therapy.
It wasn't even sex!

271
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,554
It was sadistic abuse.

272
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:06,726
I hope I've made myself clear.
It's over. Now.

273
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:24,367
Cup of tea?

274
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:33,758
I'm a therapist, Joseph.

275
00:25:34,174 --> 00:25:35,941
There's a reason
for everything I do.

276
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:41,348
Acting out her abuse fantasy
is what enables Maria...

277
00:25:41,868 --> 00:25:44,467
to get past the guilt
and anxiety of being intimate.

278
00:25:47,689 --> 00:25:51,605
If we don't express these fantasies,
they run our lives insidiously.

279
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:56,388
When she stops asking for abuse,
her need for it will be gone.

280
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,572
This is insane.
It's insane.

281
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,310
I'm sitting here having tea with
the doctor who's fucking my wife...

282
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:10,631
and trying to convince me
that it's good for her.

283
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,791
Don't you get it, man?
She needs medical help.

284
00:26:15,553 --> 00:26:19,607
Maria's been in traditional therapy
for seven years. Three therapists.

285
00:26:20,508 --> 00:26:22,761
Which therapy do you think
will work at this point?

286
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:33,504
Do you know what
a borderline personality is?

287
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,692
They told you there was no cure,
and they were right.

288
00:26:37,282 --> 00:26:40,054
There is no
psychoanalytic cure.

289
00:26:40,712 --> 00:26:45,045
The mind...
cannot change the mind.

290
00:26:46,015 --> 00:26:47,922
Real change
is not a mental process.

291
00:26:52,773 --> 00:26:55,926
Let me guess.
You think sex...

292
00:26:56,654 --> 00:26:59,946
your sex, in particular...
will heal Maria, is that it?

293
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,204
Yes and no. I hold
no dominion over my teachings.

294
00:27:03,828 --> 00:27:05,457
I only know they work.

295
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:09,685
But, yes, conscious sex
that achieves bliss...

296
00:27:10,516 --> 00:27:12,596
is the greatest healer there is.

297
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,512
So the way to heal the woman
is to fuck her?

298
00:27:16,963 --> 00:27:21,467
No. Conscious sex, physically
and emotionally integrated...

299
00:27:22,472 --> 00:27:24,621
is one way to heal
a human being.

300
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:26,770
Ecstasy heals the unconscious.

301
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:30,478
A woman can heal
a man as well.

302
00:27:30,928 --> 00:27:32,973
Well, I hope you
don't mind, Doctor...

303
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:35,503
but I'm gonna try some
other approaches at this point.

304
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,617
I know you love Maria, Joseph.

305
00:27:37,964 --> 00:27:40,077
I'm not here
to take that away from you.

306
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:45,172
Just don't make me
take this any further.

307
00:27:49,157 --> 00:27:50,786
I am not the enemy.

308
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:55,569
I don't know what you are.

309
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,525
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
I'm almost done with the kitchen.

310
00:31:11,442 --> 00:31:14,179
- What are you doin'?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

311
00:31:15,842 --> 00:31:19,100
The entire house
is infested with bugs.

312
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:22,878
First I spray with the Raid
to kill any eggs, and then I seal.

313
00:31:24,472 --> 00:31:27,798
Maria, we discussed the fact that
flies do not lay eggs in the house.

314
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:30,745
Ants, Joseph. Ants!

315
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,379
The wastebasket was full
of them this morning.

316
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,414
Maria, we've gotta talk.

317
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:44,087
Okay. Just let me
finish the kitchen first.

318
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:47,656
And if you wanna help, you can
start cleaning the bathroom.

319
00:31:48,142 --> 00:31:49,805
Just go through
your drawers, okay?

320
00:32:09,974 --> 00:32:11,881
Hi.

321
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:14,168
What time is it?

322
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:20,094
It's 5:45 a. m. You busy?

323
00:32:20,753 --> 00:32:23,525
No. No. Of course not.

324
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:27,129
Well, I guess
we'll have some breakfast.

325
00:32:34,857 --> 00:32:36,521
Maria's gettin' worse.

326
00:32:39,155 --> 00:32:40,887
I'm sure she's very frightened.

327
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,363
Therapy isn't working.

328
00:32:52,393 --> 00:32:54,195
I want you to teach me
what you do.

329
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,319
You want to learn from me?

330
00:32:58,735 --> 00:33:00,364
I wanna learn
how to heal my wife.

331
00:33:02,201 --> 00:33:03,864
That's not possible.

332
00:33:09,963 --> 00:33:12,910
You fascinate me.
First you want to destroy me.

333
00:33:13,602 --> 00:33:15,404
Now you want
to become my acolyte.

334
00:33:20,222 --> 00:33:22,473
Do you play
a musical instrument?

335
00:33:24,138 --> 00:33:25,385
No.

336
00:33:31,173 --> 00:33:34,707
Do you think you have the ability
to put aside your rage and listen?

337
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:37,687
Look, the rage is gone, okay?

338
00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:40,737
The only thing that's important
to me now is helping Maria.

339
00:33:43,232 --> 00:33:44,827
If I agree to help you...

340
00:33:45,243 --> 00:33:48,258
you must understand
it means precisely that.

341
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:52,867
I'm helping you.
Maria has her own path.

342
00:33:54,738 --> 00:33:56,436
I understand.

343
00:33:56,852 --> 00:34:00,352
- I'm not sure you do.
- And you have to promise me...

344
00:34:01,149 --> 00:34:03,090
that you'll never see Maria again.

345
00:34:03,506 --> 00:34:06,833
Ah! Is that what you're
really doing here, Joseph?

346
00:34:07,596 --> 00:34:10,472
- Preventing me seeing your wife?
- Do we have a deal or not?

347
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:15,393
I doubt the rage is gone.

348
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:18,998
But we can put it to good use.

349
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,908
And I agree with you.

350
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:24,091
As I teach you
the ways of love...

351
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:28,042
it would not be
my place to see Maria.

352
00:34:32,963 --> 00:34:35,354
I saw you at the symphony
the other night.

353
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:38,092
- I followed you there.
- I'm the substitute.

354
00:34:38,612 --> 00:34:41,766
I'd like to play more, but I don't
have the time to devote myself.

355
00:34:43,637 --> 00:34:45,231
So, we have a deal.

356
00:34:45,647 --> 00:34:49,078
You can choose to leave at any time,
and I may ask you to leave.

357
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:54,415
But the work and our relationship
must remain strictly confidential.

358
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:10,703
Do you really
love Maria that much?

359
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,679
Too bad for you.

360
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:25,328
<i>Okay, describe to me how
you make love to a woman. </i>

361
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,462
And tell me, in detail,
when and how you make love.

362
00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:36,106
Well...

363
00:35:38,531 --> 00:35:41,026
one of us starts
kissing the other one...

364
00:35:41,616 --> 00:35:43,245
usually at night
before we go to bed.

365
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:50,557
- Then I kiss her breasts for a while.
- How?

366
00:35:51,285 --> 00:35:52,532
How?

367
00:35:59,706 --> 00:36:01,092
I kiss.

368
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,142
I suck...

369
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,058
twirl my tongue.

370
00:36:11,592 --> 00:36:13,395
How does it feel?

371
00:36:13,811 --> 00:36:15,232
Aroused.

372
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:20,118
Like I want her.

373
00:36:21,573 --> 00:36:24,485
Then... kiss her tummy
for a while.

374
00:36:28,817 --> 00:36:31,208
Turn her over sometimes
and kiss her bottom.

375
00:36:32,905 --> 00:36:35,574
- I like to do that.
- How does she feel?

376
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:41,605
I don't know.

377
00:36:51,447 --> 00:36:55,675
Then I usually kiss her
down there for a while.

378
00:36:56,645 --> 00:36:57,928
Down there?

379
00:36:58,274 --> 00:36:59,764
You mean, her vagina?

380
00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:02,883
Yeah?

381
00:37:03,229 --> 00:37:06,695
- Go on.
- And...

382
00:37:08,671 --> 00:37:12,344
Sometimes, I use my fingers.

383
00:37:13,176 --> 00:37:15,567
I... So I can hold her while we...

384
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:19,587
You know.

385
00:37:28,597 --> 00:37:31,161
Then I get inside her...

386
00:37:32,998 --> 00:37:34,593
and we make love...

387
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:38,301
like normal, I guess.

388
00:37:39,687 --> 00:37:41,178
Anything else?

389
00:37:44,954 --> 00:37:46,515
Sometimes she cries.

390
00:37:53,411 --> 00:37:56,356
Does Maria
ever have an orgasm?

391
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,510
No, I guess not.

392
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:02,733
- Not with me anyway.
- Not with anyone, Joseph.

393
00:38:03,391 --> 00:38:05,298
Maria is frigid.

394
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,183
- Do you make love to yourself?
- Hmm?

395
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:15,140
- Do you masturbate?
- No. No. Not...

396
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:17,981
Rarely when I'm in a relationship.

397
00:38:18,467 --> 00:38:20,754
Well, we'll have to change that.

398
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,868
How can you make love
to someone else...

399
00:38:23,249 --> 00:38:25,225
if you can't make love
to yourself?

400
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:33,611
So, Joseph, what are you
doing to help Maria?

401
00:38:34,235 --> 00:38:36,695
Well, I do what I can, you know.
I try to make her go to therapy...

402
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:39,190
Only do what I say.

403
00:38:39,606 --> 00:38:42,794
I don't want you to make love
to her until I say otherwise.

404
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:47,058
I want you to hold her
and talk to her in bed...

405
00:38:47,854 --> 00:38:49,899
about intimate things...

406
00:38:50,419 --> 00:38:52,325
the most intimate feelings
you're having.

407
00:38:53,885 --> 00:38:57,385
When you sleep, spoon her.

408
00:38:58,112 --> 00:38:59,776
<i>Right side to the bed. </i>

409
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:04,039
<i>We call this
the nurturing position. </i>

410
00:40:00,007 --> 00:40:02,607
Come on in, Joseph.
Go into the room on your left...

411
00:40:03,231 --> 00:40:05,275
and take off all your clothes
except your shorts.

412
00:41:10,531 --> 00:41:12,160
Naw, forget it.

413
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:21,171
Come and stand over here.

414
00:41:22,556 --> 00:41:25,918
I want you to look in the mirror
and tell me what you see.

415
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,829
Tell me about your body.

416
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:31,082
You're jokin', right?

417
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:35,483
Okay then.
Is this as far as we go?

418
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:46,157
I guess I'm a bit too thin.

419
00:41:49,414 --> 00:41:51,043
My legs are
definitely too skinny.

420
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:57,524
I don't know.
It's fine. Why?

421
00:41:58,044 --> 00:42:00,955
Well, you stand as if
you don't like your body.

422
00:42:01,648 --> 00:42:03,277
I like your body.

423
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:05,356
It's lean...

424
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:07,019
strong.

425
00:42:09,584 --> 00:42:11,733
Capable hands,
well-defined feet.

426
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:14,851
Of course, you could
change it if you wanted...

427
00:42:15,163 --> 00:42:17,243
but it's better to change
how you feel about it.

428
00:42:20,536 --> 00:42:22,407
Anyone that doesn't
totally accept their body...

429
00:42:22,857 --> 00:42:24,520
can never experience ecstasy...

430
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:29,130
can never enable another
to experience it.

431
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:33,288
What do you think
about your penis?

432
00:42:38,209 --> 00:42:39,873
Well, to be honest, I like it.

433
00:42:40,288 --> 00:42:42,507
It's... large and powerful.

434
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,383
Good. I want you
to feel that way.

435
00:42:45,937 --> 00:42:47,810
I'm sure it's true.

436
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,923
Later on, I can
give you some exercises...

437
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:52,384
to further increase its size.

438
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,567
Good for you.
Good for Maria.

439
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:58,968
Now, every night
before you go to sleep...

440
00:43:00,805 --> 00:43:02,815
<i>I want you to practice
what I call... </i>

441
00:43:03,334 --> 00:43:05,275
"the bliss" carezza. "

442
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:10,682
<i>Barely touching Maria... </i>

443
00:43:11,202 --> 00:43:14,494
<i>tenderly stroke her body
from head to toe with your hand. </i>

444
00:43:19,276 --> 00:43:21,009
<i>We are sensitizing her body... </i>

445
00:43:23,747 --> 00:43:25,896
<i>awakening her ecstatic responses. </i>

446
00:43:29,604 --> 00:43:32,133
<i>Then, her hand on you. </i>

447
00:43:37,886 --> 00:43:39,585
<i>Imagine life energy... </i>

448
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:42,010
<i>flowing through her hands. </i>

449
00:43:48,907 --> 00:43:50,536
<i>Feel the electricity. </i>

450
00:44:10,775 --> 00:44:12,507
<i>I promised Joseph
I wouldn't come here. </i>

451
00:44:16,423 --> 00:44:18,052
I don't want to hurt him...

452
00:44:19,335 --> 00:44:20,582
or us.

453
00:44:25,226 --> 00:44:26,439
It's just...

454
00:44:28,276 --> 00:44:29,939
Sometimes, I get scared.

455
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,103
Would you like to dance?

456
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:49,000
I always wanted to be
a ballroom dancer...

457
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:52,638
you know, the kind
that dons a tux every night and...

458
00:44:53,331 --> 00:44:54,995
dances the world.

459
00:45:32,631 --> 00:45:34,260
Did you enjoy the dance?

460
00:45:36,512 --> 00:45:38,141
Yes.

461
00:45:38,557 --> 00:45:40,393
As did I.

462
00:45:40,844 --> 00:45:42,473
Very much.

463
00:45:43,512 --> 00:45:45,453
And if you enjoy the dance, Maria...

464
00:45:48,226 --> 00:45:50,652
Then the dance is enough.

465
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:54,636
I promise.

466
00:45:57,097 --> 00:45:59,177
Have a cigar.
They're very mild.

467
00:45:59,697 --> 00:46:01,360
- Oh, no. No, thank you.
- Have one anyway.

468
00:46:17,786 --> 00:46:19,971
Most men fear
women's power, Joseph.

469
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,446
A sexually conscious woman
is as powerful as any being on the planet.

470
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:29,882
We are entering a new era.

471
00:46:30,402 --> 00:46:32,585
It will be the resurgence
of the divine feminine spirit.

472
00:46:34,387 --> 00:46:36,015
We must honor that spirit...

473
00:46:36,432 --> 00:46:38,407
in ourselves...

474
00:46:38,892 --> 00:46:40,521
and in others.

475
00:46:42,912 --> 00:46:44,818
You have to suck on it
once in a while.

476
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:46,897
Otherwise, it goes out.

477
00:47:01,799 --> 00:47:04,572
The goal of sex
is not orgasm, Joseph...

478
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,859
but ecstasy.

479
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,607
Maria's satisfaction
will give you ecstasy.

480
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:13,478
Nothing else.

481
00:47:15,938 --> 00:47:18,538
There are nine levels...
movements, I call them...

482
00:47:19,162 --> 00:47:20,929
to a woman's orgasm.

483
00:47:21,345 --> 00:47:24,845
Now, most lovers
only achieve level four...

484
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:27,652
the ultimate release...

485
00:47:28,172 --> 00:47:29,905
but it's just the threshold.

486
00:47:30,321 --> 00:47:32,574
Between movements five and nine...

487
00:47:33,128 --> 00:47:34,895
is where true healing occurs.

488
00:47:36,732 --> 00:47:38,777
To reach these movements...

489
00:47:39,296 --> 00:47:41,895
you must practice with diligence
the exercises I give you.

490
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,148
One of their purposes...

491
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:47,614
is to make orgasm
and ejaculation a voluntary act.

492
00:47:48,307 --> 00:47:49,936
I thought
they were the same thing.

493
00:47:50,352 --> 00:47:52,015
Most people do.

494
00:47:52,431 --> 00:47:55,134
In truth, both orgasm and ejaculation
are governed...

495
00:47:55,758 --> 00:47:58,392
by different
neurological mechanisms.

496
00:48:01,061 --> 00:48:03,729
You must learn to separate
and control each at will.

497
00:48:06,328 --> 00:48:07,991
What do you mean?

498
00:48:08,407 --> 00:48:10,590
The only way to really satisfy
a woman and yourself...

499
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:13,225
is to have control...

500
00:48:13,744 --> 00:48:16,274
complete control
over your ejaculation.

501
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:21,923
Then you are no longer
led around by your penis.

502
00:48:24,557 --> 00:48:27,052
This has far-reaching implications
in all areas of life...

503
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:29,270
don't you think?

504
00:48:34,295 --> 00:48:37,588
Well, sir, are you saying that
I'm never supposed to come?

505
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:39,979
When you choose.

506
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:43,271
That way, you don't
dissipate your life force.

507
00:48:43,825 --> 00:48:46,182
Don't you feel tired
after you've made love?

508
00:48:49,196 --> 00:48:51,380
I will teach you
how to "injaculate... "

509
00:48:53,286 --> 00:48:56,267
so you can have many orgasms
without losing your power.

510
00:48:58,034 --> 00:49:00,564
Yes, I will teach you and Maria...

511
00:49:01,152 --> 00:49:03,475
a greater pleasure
than you imagine possible.

512
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:07,529
Go on. Let's see how you do.

513
00:49:28,704 --> 00:49:30,611
I can go a lot further.

514
00:49:31,061 --> 00:49:33,903
I just got
some lungs in my water.

515
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:42,566
Okay, using your left hand,
close your left nostril...

516
00:49:43,363 --> 00:49:46,239
and breathe in through your right nostril
to a count of seven.

517
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:49,809
Then close both nostrils...

518
00:49:50,295 --> 00:49:52,547
and hold for a count of 14.

519
00:49:53,101 --> 00:49:54,730
Open the left nostril...

520
00:49:55,112 --> 00:49:57,399
and breathe out
through a count of seven.

521
00:49:57,919 --> 00:49:59,894
Close the right nostril...

522
00:50:00,379 --> 00:50:02,874
and hold for a count of 14.

523
00:50:03,464 --> 00:50:05,577
Keeping the left nostril open...

524
00:50:06,097 --> 00:50:08,523
breathe in to a count of seven.

525
00:50:09,113 --> 00:50:10,741
Close both nostrils...

526
00:50:11,954 --> 00:50:14,866
Two, three, four, five.

527
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:19,198
Why would anybody
wanna do this?

528
00:50:24,326 --> 00:50:26,198
Okay, Joseph,
I'm ready to come down.

529
00:50:29,836 --> 00:50:31,500
Joseph, come on.

530
00:50:36,663 --> 00:50:38,326
No sex without condoms.

531
00:50:38,742 --> 00:50:40,371
No booze, no drugs.

532
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,451
Now you tell me
I can't even come?

533
00:50:44,773 --> 00:50:46,402
I know.
It's depressing, isn't it?

534
00:50:46,818 --> 00:50:48,065
Boy!

535
00:50:55,065 --> 00:50:56,313
- Hey.
- Hey.

536
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,288
I just have to run an errand.
I'll be right back.

537
00:50:58,704 --> 00:51:00,368
- Okay.
- Done your exercises?

538
00:51:01,824 --> 00:51:04,111
Well, I tried, but...

539
00:51:04,665 --> 00:51:06,294
I don't know.
I just can't do it.

540
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:09,344
I can't just think of myself.
I need to fantasize.

541
00:51:11,145 --> 00:51:14,022
Go to the white room, Joseph.
Try again.

542
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:17,002
Concentrate
on your own sexual power.

543
00:51:17,488 --> 00:51:19,151
Don't throw it away on fantasy.

544
00:51:21,334 --> 00:51:23,795
You don't want me
to take you through them, do you?

545
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,129
<i>Maria remains a mystery. </i>

546
00:52:18,724 --> 00:52:22,085
<i>It's hard for me to determine the roots
ofher sexual dysfunction... </i>

547
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:25,481
<i>or the extent
ofher childhood trauma. </i>

548
00:52:26,071 --> 00:52:28,774
<i>There have, to date,
been no repressed-memory flashes... </i>

549
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:31,096
<i>or nightmares... </i>

550
00:52:31,546 --> 00:52:34,978
<i>yet she lives in a constant state
of suppressed paranoia. </i>

551
00:52:38,478 --> 00:52:40,731
<i>Maria is oddly protective
ofJoseph. </i>

552
00:52:42,636 --> 00:52:44,577
<i>He seems to be a good person... </i>

553
00:52:45,027 --> 00:52:46,934
<i>captured by Maria's
intense passion... </i>

554
00:52:47,419 --> 00:52:50,676
<i>which often springs forth
to surprise me at any moment... </i>

555
00:52:51,439 --> 00:52:54,246
<i>captured by her beauty
and seductive charms... </i>

556
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:57,850
<i>and, most likely, captured
by his own need... </i>

557
00:52:58,544 --> 00:53:01,870
<i>to suck love from those who are
too wounded to give it freely. </i>

558
00:53:06,272 --> 00:53:07,935
<i>I know this man. </i>

559
00:53:23,703 --> 00:53:24,777
Finally.

560
00:53:25,089 --> 00:53:28,277
<i>Hera:
Trials of the Goddess Obscura. </i>

561
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:31,569
First published in 1908.

562
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:34,100
It's been out of print
since 1932.

563
00:53:35,659 --> 00:53:37,704
You have yet
to let me down, Eva.

564
00:53:39,506 --> 00:53:42,209
I find the combination
of charm and intelligence...

565
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:46,229
a rare union these days.

566
00:53:53,472 --> 00:53:55,447
<i>Maria will take time. </i>

567
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:58,983
<i>She is in the darkness
before self-realization. </i>

568
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:01,374
<i>She needs to feel free... </i>

569
00:54:01,789 --> 00:54:04,284
<i>to express herself in ways
she cannot with her husband. </i>

570
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,537
<i>She needs to be released
from the burdens... </i>

571
00:54:06,953 --> 00:54:08,652
<i>ofher shame and self-hatred. </i>

572
00:54:10,211 --> 00:54:11,874
I will try.

573
00:54:20,504 --> 00:54:22,409
How are the exercises going?

574
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:26,776
Fine.

575
00:54:28,128 --> 00:54:29,757
Everything's going fine.

576
00:54:30,173 --> 00:54:31,870
I want you to do them
three times a day.

577
00:54:33,153 --> 00:54:34,782
Draw the energy
up to the heart chakra...

578
00:54:35,198 --> 00:54:37,553
and then progress to the third eye,
as we discussed.

579
00:54:39,426 --> 00:54:41,470
I work all day.

580
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,658
Then I suggest you close your door.

581
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:48,783
Can you explain it to me?

582
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:53,461
Well, Joseph, you know,
the construction supervisor...

583
00:54:54,223 --> 00:54:57,481
is talking about chakras,
reads books about Hinduism.

584
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:00,184
MyJoseph
is talking about chakras.

585
00:55:00,669 --> 00:55:02,436
I think thatJoseph's discovery
that his relationship with you...

586
00:55:02,852 --> 00:55:05,209
is not what he thought it was
has had a profound effect on him.

587
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:08,639
It's like... he has this inner life
that I...

588
00:55:13,111 --> 00:55:14,358
What?

589
00:55:15,883 --> 00:55:17,546
Nothing.

590
00:55:17,996 --> 00:55:19,973
I just had a bizarre thought.

591
00:55:24,685 --> 00:55:26,522
Anyway...

592
00:55:26,973 --> 00:55:28,948
last night, we just...

593
00:55:29,433 --> 00:55:32,345
sat in bed and talked...

594
00:55:33,037 --> 00:55:34,666
sort of.

595
00:55:35,845 --> 00:55:37,266
Tell me.

596
00:55:37,578 --> 00:55:39,345
I can't. I can't.

597
00:55:44,197 --> 00:55:45,410
Okay.

598
00:55:48,875 --> 00:55:50,538
He sat me down
in front of a mirror...

599
00:55:50,955 --> 00:55:52,687
and he asked me
to masturbate for him.

600
00:55:54,767 --> 00:55:57,054
He wanted me to show him
step-by-step...

601
00:55:57,608 --> 00:55:59,237
how I like to be touched.

602
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,737
He wanted to know
how to please me.

603
00:56:05,198 --> 00:56:06,861
How did that feel?

604
00:56:07,277 --> 00:56:09,391
I wouldn't do it at first.
I was too embarrassed.

605
00:56:11,644 --> 00:56:13,307
Then he did it.

606
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,337
I learned so much about him
by watching him...

607
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,050
how he touched himself.

608
00:56:27,308 --> 00:56:28,937
Then I did it.

609
00:56:31,744 --> 00:56:33,823
Do you feel you got closer
to an orgasm?

610
00:56:35,001 --> 00:56:37,913
Oh, God, no!
I was far too self-conscious.

611
00:56:38,605 --> 00:56:40,234
But this is good.

612
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,606
Before we end, though, Maria,
I would like to encourage you...

613
00:56:46,057 --> 00:56:47,720
to return to therapy
with a greater commitment.

614
00:56:48,136 --> 00:56:49,799
I don't know.

615
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:54,582
I worry too much
when I see you.

616
00:56:55,102 --> 00:56:58,290
- I try to control my thoughts.
- We are what we think, Maria.

617
00:56:58,983 --> 00:57:01,755
Life is learning to come to terms
with our thoughts.

618
00:57:02,414 --> 00:57:04,909
The terms of my thoughts
are unreasonable, Alfred.

619
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,519
It's just as well
I leave them alone.

620
00:57:11,702 --> 00:57:11,806
Start by using
your ring finger.

621
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,716
Start by using
your ring finger.

622
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,940
Slip it in gently
and curl it...

623
00:57:18,564 --> 00:57:21,856
so your fingertip is touching
the ceiling of the yoni.

624
00:57:22,584 --> 00:57:24,281
Go as deep as you can.

625
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:26,916
Then slide your finger down
until you feel it.

626
00:57:30,034 --> 00:57:32,807
- How will I know?
- Most likely, she'll tell you.

627
00:57:33,431 --> 00:57:35,094
She'll feel it if you don't.

628
00:57:37,139 --> 00:57:39,149
When you find the sacred spot...

629
00:57:39,669 --> 00:57:41,505
never break eye contact
with Maria.

630
00:57:47,223 --> 00:57:48,887
Does it hurt?

631
00:57:50,204 --> 00:57:52,664
- It's just sensitive.
- Is it too much?

632
00:57:56,338 --> 00:57:57,966
It feels raw...

633
00:57:59,595 --> 00:58:01,259
almost like it's burning.

634
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:08,363
The first few times
the sacred spot is touched...

635
00:58:10,235 --> 00:58:11,898
it can be frightening.

636
00:58:12,314 --> 00:58:14,151
She may experience pain.

637
00:58:14,601 --> 00:58:16,750
I'm scared, Joseph.

638
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,517
It's okay.

639
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:20,770
Just keep stroking.

640
00:58:21,186 --> 00:58:23,543
The sensation will change.

641
00:58:30,959 --> 00:58:33,142
Stay with me, okay?

642
00:58:33,662 --> 00:58:36,053
- I love you.
- I love you too.

643
00:58:46,137 --> 00:58:49,291
Stay with her for only
30 seconds or so...

644
00:58:50,019 --> 00:58:51,856
and then slowly withdraw...

645
00:58:52,306 --> 00:58:54,490
but hold her very closely.

646
00:58:55,842 --> 00:58:59,238
You are assuming the role of healer
in this act, Joseph.

647
00:59:01,143 --> 00:59:03,674
All Maria's abuse
and psychic hurts...

648
00:59:04,262 --> 00:59:06,030
reside in this sacred spot.

649
00:59:07,416 --> 00:59:09,045
It will take time
to release them.

650
01:00:49,165 --> 01:00:50,793
A bit late,
aren't you, Joseph?

651
01:00:52,873 --> 01:00:55,091
I feel it, you know,
what you've been talking about.

652
01:00:55,646 --> 01:00:58,141
I've been doing the exercises,
and I feel it.

653
01:01:00,254 --> 01:01:01,918
Describe this feeling.

654
01:01:04,448 --> 01:01:06,805
It's like this, you know, this sadness
that I've been carrying around...

655
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,092
has just, you know...
It's lifted.

656
01:01:09,543 --> 01:01:11,968
And I feel...
I just feel the love.

657
01:01:12,522 --> 01:01:15,156
I feel in love with myself.

658
01:01:27,632 --> 01:01:30,613
So, what's on for today?

659
01:01:31,306 --> 01:01:33,351
Nothing's on for today, Joseph.

660
01:01:33,836 --> 01:01:35,500
I have a very busy evening...

661
01:01:35,915 --> 01:01:38,099
a performance and a date.

662
01:01:39,346 --> 01:01:40,767
You have a date?

663
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:43,088
Indeed.

664
01:01:43,436 --> 01:01:44,995
And so do you.

665
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:47,698
It's time for you and Maria
to make love.

666
01:01:53,624 --> 01:01:55,392
Now remember...

667
01:01:55,807 --> 01:01:57,575
make love from the heart...

668
01:01:58,026 --> 01:01:59,689
nowhere else.

669
01:02:00,105 --> 01:02:01,317
Keep your eyes open...

670
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:03,882
move extremely slowly...

671
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:06,030
and, most importantly...

672
01:02:07,452 --> 01:02:10,536
with love and adoration.

673
01:02:13,135 --> 01:02:15,319
What about
the nine levels of orgasm?

674
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,472
Later. Don't concern yourself
with orgasm.

675
01:02:19,096 --> 01:02:21,903
For Maria, it will take much time.

676
01:02:22,562 --> 01:02:24,537
For you, it's forbidden.

677
01:02:35,453 --> 01:02:37,116
I feel the love.

678
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,760
I love myself.

679
01:02:42,246 --> 01:02:44,013
- I love myself.
- Congratulations, buddy.

680
01:02:47,409 --> 01:02:49,176
I love myself three times a day.

681
01:02:49,628 --> 01:02:51,257
I feel the love.

682
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:15,688
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

683
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:39,532
- Hello.
- What's so funny?

684
01:03:41,992 --> 01:03:43,690
How did you know
I was laughing?

685
01:03:46,844 --> 01:03:48,889
I just know.

686
01:03:49,339 --> 01:03:51,141
I've been learning more...

687
01:03:51,592 --> 01:03:53,601
and more about you
every day.

688
01:03:56,201 --> 01:03:57,829
So I see.

689
01:03:59,701 --> 01:04:01,988
- When are you coming home?
- Soon.

690
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:04,969
When I do...

691
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:07,014
do you wanna make love?

692
01:04:12,523 --> 01:04:14,256
I thought
you wanted to wait.

693
01:04:17,202 --> 01:04:19,836
I mean,
are you sure you're ready?

694
01:04:27,287 --> 01:04:28,950
Under one condition.

695
01:04:31,931 --> 01:04:33,178
What's that?

696
01:04:34,426 --> 01:04:36,089
We do it my way.

697
01:04:39,728 --> 01:04:42,292
Hon, maybe we should just, you know,
hold each other first.

698
01:04:42,882 --> 01:04:44,095
Shut up.

699
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:02,809
Why are you doing this?

700
01:05:03,329 --> 01:05:04,992
'Cause I love your toes...

701
01:05:06,759 --> 01:05:08,388
and it excites me.

702
01:05:23,463 --> 01:05:24,710
Don't move.

703
01:05:35,142 --> 01:05:36,736
- Hon!
- Huh?

704
01:05:46,786 --> 01:05:48,034
It hurts.

705
01:06:26,778 --> 01:06:28,859
I love you
so deep inside me, Joseph.

706
01:06:32,219 --> 01:06:35,235
Oh, God, I feel you so...
so deep inside.

707
01:06:44,627 --> 01:06:46,290
Not so fast.

708
01:06:48,889 --> 01:06:50,622
- I'm not supposed to come.
- Huh?

709
01:06:51,003 --> 01:06:52,181
- I'm not supposed to...
- What?

710
01:06:52,528 --> 01:06:54,330
- I'm not supposed to...
- I can't hear you.

711
01:06:54,746 --> 01:06:56,409
- Don't make me come.
- Why?

712
01:07:02,474 --> 01:07:04,519
Too bad, motherfucker.

713
01:07:32,866 --> 01:07:34,531
Did you like it?

714
01:07:36,055 --> 01:07:38,169
I guess she surprised us, huh?

715
01:07:38,689 --> 01:07:40,352
Yeah.

716
01:07:40,734 --> 01:07:42,397
I felt...

717
01:07:42,813 --> 01:07:44,060
Scared?

718
01:07:45,863 --> 01:07:48,774
A woman's anger
can be very scary.

719
01:07:49,467 --> 01:07:51,789
Most don't feel they have
the right to express it.

720
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:57,299
Maybe we should encourage Maria
to vent hers more often.

721
01:07:58,096 --> 01:07:59,864
- In bed?
- Why not?

722
01:08:03,156 --> 01:08:05,374
Repressed anger...

723
01:08:05,929 --> 01:08:08,284
chokes us, closes us down.

724
01:08:13,725 --> 01:08:16,394
Are you sure it was
Maria's anger that scared you?

725
01:08:17,018 --> 01:08:18,716
What do you mean?

726
01:08:19,098 --> 01:08:20,761
How did it feel
to be fucked?

727
01:08:22,736 --> 01:08:24,781
Out of control.

728
01:08:25,265 --> 01:08:26,894
How did you feel?

729
01:08:30,811 --> 01:08:32,058
Fear.

730
01:08:43,945 --> 01:08:46,094
I was over on Hinton Street
the other day.

731
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:04,253
Does he make you feel safe?

732
01:09:15,378 --> 01:09:17,041
Does he love you no matter what?

733
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:25,462
So do I.

734
01:09:33,052 --> 01:09:34,300
Follow closely.

735
01:09:36,379 --> 01:09:38,042
Let me into your subconscious.

736
01:10:05,871 --> 01:10:07,500
Touch her like a harmonic...

737
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:09,579
gently, yin...

738
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,426
but sure, definitive.

739
01:10:32,174 --> 01:10:33,837
It's nice, huh?

740
01:11:01,389 --> 01:11:03,052
Look at me.

741
01:11:04,751 --> 01:11:05,964
Look at me.

742
01:13:00,535 --> 01:13:03,134
"Now movements" f"ive to nine. "

743
01:13:04,971 --> 01:13:06,842
<i>Support her neck
with your hand... </i>

744
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:10,030
<i>precisely at the fourth and fifth
"ce"rv"ical vertebrae. "</i>

745
01:13:12,941 --> 01:13:15,506
<i>Begin your toning
and breathe into her neck... </i>

746
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:17,724
<i>through your hand. </i>

747
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:22,056
<i>Energy follows consciousness. </i>

748
01:13:44,617 --> 01:13:46,280
Are you okay?

749
01:13:46,696 --> 01:13:48,741
Hon? Hon!

750
01:13:52,518 --> 01:13:53,766
Honey?

751
01:14:52,022 --> 01:14:53,685
Yes, I'm Joseph.

752
01:14:55,314 --> 01:14:58,398
- Do you mind if my friends...
- Anyone you want.

753
01:15:00,408 --> 01:15:03,666
Okay. When Maria
first arrived...

754
01:15:04,394 --> 01:15:06,542
her throat
was almost swollen shut.

755
01:15:07,062 --> 01:15:09,453
We injected the throat
with a strong anti-inflammatory.

756
01:15:10,007 --> 01:15:12,364
We also administered her a sedative
so she would rest.

757
01:15:15,032 --> 01:15:16,731
Now, to your knowledge...

758
01:15:17,181 --> 01:15:19,815
has anything like this
ever happened before?

759
01:15:20,370 --> 01:15:22,033
Is she allergic to anything?

760
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,805
- Any medication she might have taken?
- Not that I know of.

761
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,271
What were you doing
when this occurred?

762
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,058
We were making love...

763
01:15:35,687 --> 01:15:37,524
and she started crying...

764
01:15:38,876 --> 01:15:40,817
and then she started choking.

765
01:15:41,232 --> 01:15:43,554
She's been under a lot
of abnormal stress lately.

766
01:15:45,356 --> 01:15:47,332
She had a severe breakdown.

767
01:15:47,817 --> 01:15:49,654
She had a body memory.

768
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:53,119
Maria has endured some form
of repeated child abuse.

769
01:15:53,847 --> 01:15:55,718
She shows almost all
the external symptoms...

770
01:15:56,169 --> 01:15:57,832
but it's locked
in her subconscious.

771
01:15:59,495 --> 01:16:01,540
Now she can begin
the road to recovery.

772
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:03,689
That's possible.

773
01:16:04,105 --> 01:16:07,085
Her memory could've triggered
a spontaneous regression to some incident.

774
01:16:07,709 --> 01:16:10,620
Oral sex is one of the most common
forms of infant abuse.

775
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:18,303
It's more about acceptance
than forgiveness for me.

776
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:22,323
I got a letter a year later.

777
01:17:24,055 --> 01:17:26,031
Now she denies
that anything ever happened.

778
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,328
That's all.

779
01:17:41,521 --> 01:17:43,566
My name is Maria...

780
01:17:44,051 --> 01:17:47,967
and I'm a survivor
of child sexual abuse and incest.

781
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,488
- Hey.
- Hi.

782
01:17:55,834 --> 01:17:57,463
It's Maria's mother on the phone.

783
01:18:05,711 --> 01:18:07,374
<i>Hello, Dottie?</i>

784
01:18:12,503 --> 01:18:15,795
I support her, and I am doing
as best as I can...

785
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:18,326
as her husband
in this situation...

786
01:18:18,776 --> 01:18:20,751
but does it really matter
what I think?

787
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:25,568
I realize that you think she's ill.
She is getting help.

788
01:18:34,614 --> 01:18:36,312
Because I've seen her suffer.

789
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:40,159
Well, I'm sorry, too, Dottie.

790
01:18:59,877 --> 01:19:01,818
- Honey, it's the fifth time today you've taken...
- Leave me alone.

791
01:19:03,413 --> 01:19:05,110
We have to talk
about this, Maria.

792
01:19:06,877 --> 01:19:08,542
I just needed a shower.

793
01:19:18,869 --> 01:19:22,231
The other night, when you got up
to go to the bathroom...

794
01:19:22,993 --> 01:19:24,934
I knew it was you...

795
01:19:25,419 --> 01:19:28,503
but what I saw was him
standing there...

796
01:19:31,588 --> 01:19:33,528
naked...

797
01:19:33,943 --> 01:19:35,608
ready to come to my bed.

798
01:19:37,963 --> 01:19:41,360
We need to separate, Joseph.
I know I'm going crazy.

799
01:19:42,123 --> 01:19:44,306
You have to let me inside.

800
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:46,524
You have to let me
try to help you.

801
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:48,638
I don't feel comfortable
around you.

802
01:19:49,053 --> 01:19:51,688
- The things that you do frighten me.
- Just tell me what I can do.

803
01:19:52,277 --> 01:19:54,737
When you touch me,
I feel numb.

804
01:20:01,911 --> 01:20:05,237
I'm gonna sleep in the guest bedroom
until you find another place to stay.

805
01:20:25,615 --> 01:20:28,803
Living room, bar, kitchen...
if you wanna call it that.

806
01:20:29,462 --> 01:20:30,710
Closets.

807
01:20:31,056 --> 01:20:33,932
Clean towels, fresh linens
every other day.

808
01:20:34,591 --> 01:20:35,839
Any questions?

809
01:21:04,395 --> 01:21:06,786
Not your most confident stride,
Joseph.

810
01:21:15,381 --> 01:21:17,078
Maria asked you to leave.

811
01:21:21,098 --> 01:21:23,109
Listen, if you know everything
that's gonna happen in my life...

812
01:21:23,594 --> 01:21:25,118
for the next two years,
why don't you let me know...

813
01:21:25,534 --> 01:21:27,960
so I can plan my vacations and know
when to put my house on the market.

814
01:21:30,595 --> 01:21:32,500
Tell me what happened.

815
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:49,793
It's what Maria's going through.

816
01:21:52,392 --> 01:21:55,026
What has to do with you...

817
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:57,557
has to do with you.

818
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,384
What's that supposed to mean?

819
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:09,235
You married a scarred and
emotionally dysfunctional woman.

820
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:13,429
Has it ever occurred to you
to ask yourself why?

821
01:22:13,949 --> 01:22:17,171
Why you put up with so much
in return for so little?

822
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:20,256
Because I'm in love
with her, okay?

823
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:24,172
And because I believed in you.
I believed that we could help her!

824
01:22:24,899 --> 01:22:28,365
Our relationship has never
been about Maria. Never.

825
01:22:29,163 --> 01:22:32,419
You don't love Maria, Joseph.
You want to mold her.

826
01:22:33,147 --> 01:22:35,123
You want to make her
something forJoseph.

827
01:22:35,574 --> 01:22:37,583
And you've only ever
proven to me...

828
01:22:38,103 --> 01:22:39,732
that you'd do anything
to make that happen.

829
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:42,124
What do you know
about love? Huh?

830
01:22:45,589 --> 01:22:48,015
Love is being there when
they hate your fucking guts!

831
01:22:48,603 --> 01:22:50,128
Love is being there
when they bleed.

832
01:22:52,139 --> 01:22:55,223
Have you ever been with a woman
for more than one hour? Ever?

833
01:23:08,323 --> 01:23:11,719
Wendy takes small steps every day
to make herself attractive.

834
01:23:12,447 --> 01:23:15,497
She eats. Then she eliminates
through the esophagus, mind you.

835
01:23:16,225 --> 01:23:18,442
That's when she's not taking
the latest laxative on the market.

836
01:23:20,591 --> 01:23:22,185
A beautiful woman, Leslie.

837
01:23:22,601 --> 01:23:26,655
God made her 5'5"
and a voluptuous 128 pounds.

838
01:23:27,557 --> 01:23:29,636
But sometime, probably
when she was a teenager...

839
01:23:30,156 --> 01:23:32,200
she got the idea that
she wasn't so beautiful.

840
01:23:32,686 --> 01:23:34,523
Maybe it was because her friends,
Debbie and Connie...

841
01:23:34,973 --> 01:23:36,567
were getting all the boys.

842
01:23:36,982 --> 01:23:39,131
But she started a program
of repetitive surgery...

843
01:23:39,651 --> 01:23:41,592
to suck all the fat
from her body.

844
01:23:42,043 --> 01:23:44,608
She started with her hips,
her thighs, her tummy.

845
01:23:45,162 --> 01:23:47,692
Next month, unless
we do something to help her...

846
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,944
she'll continue with
her arms and her ankles.

847
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,608
They always do.

848
01:23:52,752 --> 01:23:56,736
Candy's had four implants.
She just can't get it quite right.

849
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:02,385
Evelyn injects her face
with cow fat six times a year.

850
01:24:04,048 --> 01:24:06,267
Jane: Two hours
on the StairMaster...

851
01:24:06,787 --> 01:24:08,831
an hour on a treadmill, daily.

852
01:24:11,292 --> 01:24:14,411
They dress to flaunt this,
to hide that.

853
01:24:15,138 --> 01:24:17,114
They cover their faces
with poisons.

854
01:24:17,565 --> 01:24:21,377
You're right. They do bleed, Joseph.
And do you know why?

855
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:26,956
Because they're desperate
to sell what men buy.

856
01:24:27,684 --> 01:24:31,080
Desperate to be what
they're not, to be loved.

857
01:24:31,878 --> 01:24:33,229
Like Maria.

858
01:24:35,274 --> 01:24:39,328
Have you ever thought
that maybe your focus on Maria...

859
01:24:40,195 --> 01:24:43,314
is a distraction from
your own fear of abandonment?

860
01:24:46,086 --> 01:24:49,031
Your own emptiness?
Your own life?

861
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:55,096
You want to be a healer?
Heal yourself.

862
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:20,117
This'll be painless.
I promise.

863
01:25:20,672 --> 01:25:23,757
- You're a deceptive asshole.
- All you gotta do is meet her.

864
01:25:24,415 --> 01:25:26,668
She just got divorced.
She was married for two years.

865
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:28,886
You guys got a lot in common.

866
01:25:30,202 --> 01:25:32,732
Now she's
a little bit flat upstairs...

867
01:25:33,356 --> 01:25:35,401
but Nancy tells me
she has a bodacious ass...

868
01:25:35,886 --> 01:25:37,550
and is not afraid to use it.

869
01:25:39,351 --> 01:25:42,297
Tanner, do me a favor, okay?

870
01:25:42,991 --> 01:25:44,896
Never talk to me about a woman
like that again.

871
01:25:48,293 --> 01:25:49,922
What is wrong with you?

872
01:26:06,591 --> 01:26:08,185
<i>Joseph, are you with me?</i>

873
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,957
Hmm? Yeah. Sorry.

874
01:26:12,482 --> 01:26:14,839
Okay. Arthur wants you to take
a meeting with the Kensor group.

875
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:16,640
Will you do it?

876
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:19,760
No. You know what?

877
01:26:20,176 --> 01:26:22,393
Cancel my 2:30 meeting
with Cruise, too, would you?

878
01:26:23,884 --> 01:26:25,963
- Where you going?
- Goin' out for a while.

879
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,347
Hello?

880
01:27:17,877 --> 01:27:19,506
Yes, Doctor.

881
01:27:21,377 --> 01:27:23,110
No. No, I'll be there.

882
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:26,818
3:00 Tuesday?

883
01:27:28,655 --> 01:27:31,150
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, I understand.

884
01:27:38,809 --> 01:27:41,235
<i>They don't want to be alone
in their healing anymore. </i>

885
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:44,666
<i>They want you to understand,
to be aware... </i>

886
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:48,166
and to hear them.

887
01:27:48,547 --> 01:27:51,701
Beyond that, there are
no expectations.

888
01:27:53,815 --> 01:27:55,409
Are there any questions?

889
01:28:01,162 --> 01:28:03,727
Okay. Who would like
to go first?

890
01:28:05,736 --> 01:28:07,365
I would.

891
01:28:15,232 --> 01:28:16,756
My name is Maria...

892
01:28:18,074 --> 01:28:20,430
and my husband is Joseph.

893
01:28:28,748 --> 01:28:31,381
From the time I was a baby...

894
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:34,293
until I was about
ten years old...

895
01:28:34,847 --> 01:28:37,689
I loved my father
more than anything else.

896
01:28:38,347 --> 01:28:40,842
Nobody could say anything bad
about him to me.

897
01:28:41,431 --> 01:28:43,372
The world loved him too.

898
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:50,685
I have recently remembered
a lot of things.

899
01:28:54,150 --> 01:28:56,715
I remembered that
my father's favorite thing...

900
01:28:57,303 --> 01:28:59,799
was to kiss my vagina
when I was a baby.

901
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:05,863
I remember I'd wake up in the middle
of the night sucking his penis.

902
01:29:08,913 --> 01:29:10,577
I didn't even know
what it was.

903
01:29:14,458 --> 01:29:16,919
My mother went away on a trip
when I was five years old.

904
01:29:19,795 --> 01:29:22,117
This was the first time
he put his penis in me.

905
01:29:24,197 --> 01:29:25,860
I bled for days.

906
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:32,133
He told me that's what
daddies and little girls do...

907
01:29:34,212 --> 01:29:35,841
that it was our secret.

908
01:29:38,162 --> 01:29:41,420
He made me believe that every father
did that with their daughter.

909
01:29:44,782 --> 01:29:46,376
So I believed him...

910
01:29:52,579 --> 01:29:54,242
and I became that.

911
01:29:58,054 --> 01:29:59,719
And I enjoyed it too.

912
01:30:03,739 --> 01:30:05,887
It seemed to stop
when I was about 11 or 12.

913
01:30:06,407 --> 01:30:08,347
I don't know why...

914
01:30:10,011 --> 01:30:11,675
but I still loved him.

915
01:30:13,026 --> 01:30:14,689
I had no choice.

916
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:18,779
I became the woman that
my father wanted me to be.

917
01:30:19,299 --> 01:30:20,892
I dressed how
he told me to dress.

918
01:30:21,274 --> 01:30:24,670
I presented myself
as a happy, bubbly girl.

919
01:30:28,378 --> 01:30:29,799
Still do.

920
01:30:32,606 --> 01:30:34,651
It's the way
that I block the feelings.

921
01:30:37,389 --> 01:30:39,468
It's the way
that I block the pain.

922
01:30:50,038 --> 01:30:51,840
I know I've been away
a long time.

923
01:30:55,722 --> 01:30:58,147
I had to confront my self-hatred...

924
01:30:58,737 --> 01:31:00,782
and I am terrified of you...

925
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:06,742
but it's because
you make me feel so good...

926
01:31:09,099 --> 01:31:10,727
like my father did.

927
01:31:12,218 --> 01:31:16,307
My father, who was supposed to
keep me safe from harm, was the harm.

928
01:31:20,188 --> 01:31:21,783
Can you understand?

929
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:29,615
Do you?

930
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:40,947
<i>Look at the courage she has. </i>

931
01:31:41,432 --> 01:31:44,897
So many people go
the other way, live as victims.

932
01:31:46,908 --> 01:31:50,754
They use their abuse as an excuse
to close down, to give in to life.

933
01:31:53,077 --> 01:31:54,636
How do you let it go?

934
01:31:56,091 --> 01:31:58,136
You look it straight
in the eye...

935
01:31:58,622 --> 01:32:00,666
and risk letting someone love you.

936
01:32:02,122 --> 01:32:03,785
Maria did that today.

937
01:32:09,018 --> 01:32:11,201
She's gonna be a different woman
when she gets through this.

938
01:32:14,112 --> 01:32:15,707
Yes.

939
01:32:31,752 --> 01:32:35,703
You know, it's not good for you
to have so many orgasms.

940
01:32:36,569 --> 01:32:38,233
You need to learn
to preserve your yang...

941
01:32:38,683 --> 01:32:40,277
and prolong your sexual activity.

942
01:32:40,658 --> 01:32:43,049
Good for you.
Good for your wife.

943
01:32:43,639 --> 01:32:46,861
- Okay. Thanks.
- Sure.

944
01:33:09,249 --> 01:33:12,056
I know.
I feel the same. Yeah.

945
01:33:14,067 --> 01:33:16,804
That sounds good. Okay.

946
01:33:17,463 --> 01:33:19,472
Right. Yeah.

947
01:33:42,311 --> 01:33:44,182
- Hi.
- Hi.

948
01:33:48,479 --> 01:33:50,351
Do you want
to have a seat?

949
01:33:50,766 --> 01:33:52,014
Sure.

950
01:34:02,446 --> 01:34:04,109
Do you want to play
"If you love me"?

951
01:34:08,753 --> 01:34:09,966
Okay.

952
01:34:13,674 --> 01:34:14,991
Okay.

953
01:34:19,739 --> 01:34:21,402
If you love me...

954
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:24,902
you'll understand
that I needed time...

955
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:28,471
to separate you from my abuse.

956
01:34:33,081 --> 01:34:35,333
I still wake up every morning
with my memories...

957
01:34:38,487 --> 01:34:39,943
my nightmares...

958
01:34:41,502 --> 01:34:43,062
but I'm facing them.

959
01:34:45,904 --> 01:34:48,052
I can't help feeling ugly...

960
01:34:49,785 --> 01:34:51,657
and ashamed.

961
01:34:59,801 --> 01:35:01,430
If you love me...

962
01:35:03,821 --> 01:35:05,484
let me come home.

963
01:35:43,328 --> 01:35:44,852
- Hi.
- Hi.

964
01:35:45,233 --> 01:35:46,655
I'm Eva.

965
01:35:47,936 --> 01:35:49,323
Are you here
for a violin lesson?

966
01:35:50,675 --> 01:35:52,304
No... Yes. Yes, yes, I am.

967
01:35:55,769 --> 01:35:59,200
I think I've got the wrong time,
so I'd probably better just...

968
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:04,086
Eva, this is Joseph.

969
01:36:06,374 --> 01:36:07,586
We met.

970
01:36:08,869 --> 01:36:09,943
Bye, lover.

971
01:36:17,394 --> 01:36:19,126
I'll see you Friday...

972
01:36:19,542 --> 01:36:21,691
unless you want
to drop by the library.

973
01:36:27,236 --> 01:36:28,795
Good night, Joseph.

974
01:36:37,286 --> 01:36:38,984
- Client?
- No.

975
01:36:40,891 --> 01:36:43,316
That's the healing room.
This is my bedroom.

976
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,900
A violin lesson, huh?

977
01:36:50,248 --> 01:36:51,877
Yes... No.

978
01:36:54,233 --> 01:36:57,248
I haven't exactly told her
what I do. I...

979
01:36:59,085 --> 01:37:00,713
I need a bit more time.

980
01:37:06,501 --> 01:37:08,442
Isn't she glorious?

981
01:37:08,926 --> 01:37:11,110
And you don't have to heal her?

982
01:37:14,749 --> 01:37:16,066
Do you...

983
01:37:16,447 --> 01:37:18,943
Do you ever smell her fragrance
when she's nowhere around?

984
01:37:20,848 --> 01:37:22,235
And do you...

985
01:37:23,621 --> 01:37:26,531
Do you know what she's thinking
before she even begins to tell you?

986
01:37:28,611 --> 01:37:30,309
Do you dread all the moments
in between?

987
01:37:39,493 --> 01:37:40,672
Too bad for you.
