[foreboding music]

2
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:07,860
- [Doctor] Tell me what
you're seeing right now.

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,587
[sinister music]

[man groans]

6
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:18,078
Alice?

7
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:24,014
What are you seeing now, Alice?

8
00:01:24,014 --> 00:01:25,499
- Tracy!
[girl giggles]

9
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:26,327
Tracy!

10
00:01:27,432 --> 00:01:28,916
Don't you ever run
away from me like that!

11
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,952
Where did you think
you were going?

12
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:32,264
- We're going up, huh?

13
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:33,507
- Yeah!

14
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:36,165
[ominous music]

15
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,137
- I know. Can I push it?

16
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:44,759
Can I do it?
- Sure!

17
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,692
- [Man] Hit the
top button, honey.

18
00:01:46,692 --> 00:01:49,350
- I can't reach it.
- Oh, here we go. Ready?

19
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,524
Up!

20
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:55,494
Ooh, good work.

21
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:02,846
- And then what?

22
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:07,196
What are you seeing?

23
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,372
You have to try and tell me.

24
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:17,413

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,761
[girl screams]

26
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:22,280
- Please! Please
don't hurt my baby!

27
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,145
Please, do what ever you want
to me, but don't hurt my baby.

28
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,733

[girl squeals]

30
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,025
- Please try.

31
00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:46,131
Try and tell me.

32
00:02:49,893 --> 00:02:51,205
- Up!

33
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:52,586
Ooh, good work.

34
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:53,759
Oopsie daisy. Oh!

35
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,658
- Do you live on the 13th floor?

36
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:56,624
I didn't think they used 13.

37
00:02:56,624 --> 00:02:58,454
- Oh, that was in the old days.

38
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:01,595
We're not superstitious
anymore, are we, pumpkin?

39
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:04,149
- No, not me. I'm
not superstitious.

40
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:05,185
- You're not?

41
00:03:06,531 --> 00:03:09,154
[Alice laughs]

42
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:11,639
- What else do you see, Alice?

43
00:03:14,884 --> 00:03:15,712
Tell me.

44
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:23,962

46
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:43,844
- Oh, god.

47
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:46,433
Oh, god!

48
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:47,261
Tracy?

49
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,299
Tracy?

50
00:03:52,577 --> 00:03:54,164
Tracy!

51
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:55,580
Tracy?

52
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,167
Oh, Jesus!

53
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:58,548
Oh my god! Tracy!

54
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:02,932
Tracy! [screams]

55
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:04,278
Oh, Tracy!

56
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,141
Oh, Tracy.

57
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,143
Tracy.

58
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:12,148
[machinery whirring]

59
00:04:15,393 --> 00:04:16,256
Tracy?

60
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:28,302
Oh my god. [gasps]

61
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,237
[Alice screams]

62
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:33,065
Oh god!

63
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:37,277
[Alice screams]

64
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:45,837
- [Doctor] Try and tell me.

65
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:48,736
- [sighs] Nothing.

66
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:52,084
- Well.

67
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,776
[pen scribbles]

68
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:54,604
Fine.

69
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:58,539
That was good. It was very good.

70
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:00,300
You did very well.

71
00:05:03,544 --> 00:05:04,373
Mint.

72
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,962
And just suck on it, don't chew.

73
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:12,657
Yes, we're proceeding very well.

74
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,971
We'll have you out
of here in no time.

75
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:25,325
[pensive music]

76
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:03,146
- How much longer do you
think she'll be here?

77
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:04,769
- It's really difficult to tell.

78
00:07:05,873 --> 00:07:07,323
Maybe a matter of weeks,

79
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:10,464
or it may be a considerably
longer period of time.

80
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:13,467
- Maybe somebody else can do
a lot more for her, Doctor.

81
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:14,882
She's been here four months.

82
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,437
- I understand your frustration.

83
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:23,235
- [Victor] Jesus
Christ, look at her.

84
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:27,826
Isn't there something we
can do? Give her something?

85
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:29,725
- [Doctor] I have her
on a mild sedative.

86
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:34,212
- I want my wife back.

87
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:37,664
Understand me? I...

88
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:39,251
I want my wife back.

89
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,977
- Dr. Meltzner?

90
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:43,014
There's a police
officer to see you.

91
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:44,394
He's waiting in your office.

92
00:07:44,394 --> 00:07:47,639
He's asking about Mrs. Lundgren.

93
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,261
- The police? What the
hell are they doing here?

94
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,470
- Tell them I'll be
right there, okay?

95
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,886
- Now, I told you
nobody, nobody,

96
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,646
was to come near
my wife but you.

97
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:56,096
Her health's the only
thing that matters to me,

98
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:57,477
not the goddamn police.
- Mr. Lundgren. Mr. Lundgren!

99
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,788
- What?
- I agree with you.

100
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:00,307
Now, I will handle this.

101
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:01,722
- Well, then you go handle it.

102
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:04,311
- I will. Please
wait for me here.

103
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:05,623
I'll be right back. Please?

104
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:22,122
[pensive music]

105
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:28,853
- God.

106
00:08:31,372 --> 00:08:33,858
[Victor sobs]

107
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:40,381
- What do you
think you're doing?

108
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:43,108
- I'm Detective Kurt Williams,
Ravenwood County Homicide.

109
00:08:44,662 --> 00:08:47,285
- You don't look much
like a policeman.

110
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:49,494
- Yeah, well, I do a
lot of undercover work.

111
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:55,258
Well, what I need from you

112
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:57,675
is an introduction to
one of your patients.

113
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:00,332
Alice Lundgren.

114
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:03,025
- Out of the question.

115
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:04,267
- You're not gonna make me
get a court order on this,

116
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:05,890
are you, Doctor?

117
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,132
- I've already been through this

118
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:09,479
with several members of
the police department.

119
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:12,310
Her condition is unstable.
I won't allow it.

120
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,175
Good afternoon,
Officer Williams.

121
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,177
- I'll be back.

122
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:26,082
[pensive music]

123
00:09:55,802 --> 00:09:58,218
[soft music]

124
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:01,980
- Tracy?

125
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:06,916
Tracy?

126
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,403
[suspenseful music]

127
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:19,515
Don't go.

128
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,622
Don't leave me, Tra...

129
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:26,695
[Alice whimpers]

130
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:37,913
[sobs] Oh, Tracy.

131
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:51,305
[suspenseful music]

132
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,805
- Could you leave us?

133
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:12,292
[pensive music]

134
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:58,372
[haunting music]

135
00:12:46,593 --> 00:12:48,043
- So then the cop says,

136
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:53,462
"Lady, do you know how
fast you were going?"

137
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:54,325
And I said,

138
00:12:55,775 --> 00:13:00,503
"No, the speedometer only
goes to 120." [laughs]

139
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,236
So what do you do
in here at night?

140
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:10,651
Are there any cute patients?

141
00:13:13,447 --> 00:13:15,277
Remember Brad?

142
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:18,211
He started for SC?
I'm seeing him again.

143
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:19,626
He asked how you were doing.

144
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,594
We're going to Palm
Springs this weekend.

145
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:29,774
[wistful music]

146
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:36,263
Alice, do I have to have this
conversation all by myself?

147
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,062
- I gotta get out
of here, Kathy.

148
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:42,891
- What?

149
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,066
- They're driving me crazy.

150
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:49,311
- Oh, Alice.

151
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,452
I'm sure they're gonna
let you go home soon.

152
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:54,972
I'm just so glad you've
finally realized that-

153
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:57,181
- I want out, Kathy.
I want out now.

154
00:13:59,114 --> 00:14:01,185
- But Alice, that's
not how it works.

155
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:02,565
- I'm a prisoner in here.

156
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:05,879
- You're not a prisoner.

157
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:08,813
You're a patient.

158
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:14,025
Alice, please tell me the truth.

159
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:17,511
Are you still seeing Tracy?

160
00:14:23,932 --> 00:14:26,693
- I saw her again
two nights ago.

161
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,697
- Alice.

162
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,943
Tracy is dead.

163
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:39,809
They're not gonna
let you go home

164
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:42,122
until you come to
terms with reality.

165
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,889
I'm sorry, but that's
just the way it is.

166
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,479
You're not going
to be here forever.

167
00:14:57,103 --> 00:15:00,175
As soon as you get better
they'll let you go home.

168
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:00,934
I promise.

169
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:05,145
[suspenseful music]

170
00:15:30,757 --> 00:15:33,311
As soon as you get better,
they'll let you go home.

171
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:35,624
Alice.

172
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:38,765
Alice!

173
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:41,492
[haunting music]

174
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:51,433
Now, this will make
you feel much better.

175
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:55,920
- Kathy?

176
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,821
- Now, this will make
you feel much better.

177
00:16:15,043 --> 00:16:15,905
Tracy?

178
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:26,709
No.

179
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:30,403
[ominous music]

180
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,204
No!

181
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:43,830
Damn! Damn!

182
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,211
No!

183
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:46,729
No, it's not real.

184
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:50,112
No.

185
00:16:55,842 --> 00:16:56,670
Tracy.

186
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:00,398
Tracy.

187
00:17:08,613 --> 00:17:09,442
No.

188
00:17:10,753 --> 00:17:12,169
No.

189
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:13,032
No.

190
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:14,930
No.

191
00:17:17,484 --> 00:17:19,935
- Alice, I can't
let you go home yet.

192
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:22,627
You're not well. You're
still delusionary.

193
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,596
- Not anymore. I'm fine.

194
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:28,081
I haven't seen Tracy
for two weeks now.

195
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:32,430
- When a loved one dies, it is
perfectly natural to grieve.

196
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,294
Now, you're denying your grief.

197
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:36,400
This is why you keep
having these visions.

198
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,816
- The visions are over.

199
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:41,957
I know Tracy is dead. I
know I won't see her again.

200
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:46,203
- Well.

201
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,588
I'm very glad to hear you
say that. It's a good sign.

202
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:56,834
But I still think it would
be in your best interest

203
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:58,249
for you to stay here with us

204
00:17:58,249 --> 00:18:01,010
until we're sure that
you've completely recovered.

205
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,460
- I am recovered.

206
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:05,084
If you want to keep me
here against my will,

207
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,775
you need a court order.

208
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:08,432
So either put me
in front of a judge

209
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:10,296
or let me go because I want out.

210
00:18:10,296 --> 00:18:11,366
- I'll tell you what.

211
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,438
I'll be happy to
initiate the paperwork

212
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:17,026
as soon as I've consulted
with your husband.

213
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:20,168
- It's not his
decision, it's mine!

214
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:23,032
I want to see release forms
here tomorrow afternoon.

215
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:24,172
- Alice, you don't understand.

216
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:25,449
It's more complicated than that.

217
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:28,176
The forms will take at
least a week to process.

218
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,318
- Then you have a week, no more.

219
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,397
- Charlie, I know we
bought the building.

220
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:44,364
Now I want to buy
the company. Right.

221
00:18:46,297 --> 00:18:47,402
All right, I gotta go.

222
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:49,749
Yeah, Victor here.

223
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:53,684
No, that's good, 90.
Sell at 90, right.

224
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:55,824
And don't forget to
earmark 50% of the profits

225
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:57,895
for the children's
hospital, all right?

226
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:00,069
Great.

227
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:03,832
Yeah, Bev?

228
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,352
No, no, put him through.

229
00:19:07,249 --> 00:19:09,286
Hello?
- Mr. Lundgren?

230
00:19:09,286 --> 00:19:11,495
Your wife would
like to leave us.

231
00:19:11,495 --> 00:19:15,326
She's aware of her rights
and is quite insistent.

232
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:17,535
- But I thought she was
still having hallucinations.

233
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:21,160
- [Meltzner] Well, she
maintains that she no longer is.

234
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,713
- [Victor] Really?

235
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:24,991
Well, that's wonderful.

236
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:29,237
- We could keep her here for
further observation if you'd-

237
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:30,721
- Oh, no, I don't
think that's necessary.

238
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:34,173
If she says she wants to
come, then let her come home.

239
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,899
That's great. Oh, Doctor?

240
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:39,799
Do me a favor. Give her my love.

241
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,318
- [Meltzner] Fine. Thank you.

242
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:42,940
- Right. Thank you.

243
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,494
Yeah.

244
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,086
- Alice, these are beautiful.

245
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:56,022
"Love, Victor." How nice!

246
00:19:58,058 --> 00:19:59,991
So what's with
the fitness craze?

247
00:20:02,028 --> 00:20:03,926
- I want my body to be in
as good shape as my mind

248
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:05,065
when I get out of here.

249
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,828
- Oh, you look great.
And you sound terrific.

250
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:10,692
So what the hell happened?

251
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:12,728
- What do you mean,
"What the hell happened?"

252
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:14,213
- It's just that the
last time I was here

253
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,180
you were still kind of...

254
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,940
You know.
- Crazy?

255
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,976
Is that what you want to say?

256
00:20:18,976 --> 00:20:19,804
- No!

257
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,014
- Were you beginning
to like the idea

258
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,120
of having a crazy sister?

259
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,743
- No! Of course not.

260
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:30,746
- Good. Because I'm not crazy.

261
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:31,575
Not anymore.

262
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:33,715
If I ever was.

263
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:35,682
- Good.

264
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:38,306
So, uh...

265
00:20:39,307 --> 00:20:40,860
Oh, a cop has come by my place

266
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,138
several times asking questions.

267
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:45,727
- [Alice] Really?
What'd he want to know?

268
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:47,315
- Well...

269
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:49,386
Of course, anything about the...

270
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:54,736
- It's okay, Kathy. "Murder"
is the word you're looking for.

271
00:20:57,911 --> 00:21:00,466
- Well, he also wanted to
know everything about you,

272
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:02,571
especially about you and Victor.

273
00:21:02,571 --> 00:21:04,297
I told him everything
is a lot better

274
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:05,919
now that the divorce is on hold.

275
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:09,026
- Why'd you tell him that?

276
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:10,234
- Well, it is, isn't it?

277
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,275
Well, just remember, if
Kurt comes by to see you,

278
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,863
technically speaking, you're
still a married woman.

279
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:21,210
- Kurt?

280
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,143
- The cop. Kurt Williams.

281
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:25,698
- Cop Kurt, huh?

282
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,114
[Alice laughs]

283
00:21:28,114 --> 00:21:29,184
- No, that shouldn't
be a problem.

284
00:21:29,184 --> 00:21:30,289
[knock at door]

285
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,151
Come in.

286
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:37,365
Uh, can I call you
back? Thank you.

287
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:38,227
Alice.

288
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:40,989
- I'm ready.

289
00:21:40,989 --> 00:21:43,716
- I can see. You look great.

290
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:44,510
Sit down.

291
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,546
- I prefer to stand.

292
00:21:47,478 --> 00:21:48,307
- Well.

293
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:50,550
In that case...

294
00:21:53,622 --> 00:21:55,797
Before I sign this,

295
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:57,488
I have to make
sure you understand

296
00:21:57,488 --> 00:21:59,594
the conditions of the release.

297
00:21:59,594 --> 00:22:01,285
- Oh, I know, I know.

298
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:02,700
In two weeks my case
will be reviewed

299
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,115
by the psychiatric review board,

300
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,358
at which time it
will be determined

301
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,464
whether my release
will be permanent

302
00:22:07,464 --> 00:22:10,501
or if I have to return for
further inpatient therapy.

303
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:12,572
Don't worry, I'm not
planning on coming back, Doc.

304
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:13,401
- Good.

305
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:16,956
Well, I guess that's
just about it then.

306
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,377
I do have a little
something for you though.

307
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:28,174
Kind of a going away present.

308
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:30,279
- You're so
sentimental. What is it?

309
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:32,903
- Just a mild sedative.

310
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:39,219
In case you start
getting to feel edgy.

311
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:44,673
- Peace of mind in
a bottle, eh, Doc?

312
00:22:44,673 --> 00:22:47,331
- Well, let's call it
a little insurance.

313
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:50,783
As much as I've loved
having you around here,

314
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:53,268
I really don't want
to see you come back.

315
00:22:53,268 --> 00:22:54,062
- Agreed.

316
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:55,891
- Well.

317
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,003
That's it.

318
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:05,107
- Okay.
- We're done.

319
00:23:08,007 --> 00:23:09,595
Take care, Alice. Be well.

320
00:23:09,595 --> 00:23:12,391
- I will. Can't say
it's been a pleasure.

321
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:18,327
[soft music]

322
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:27,233
Tracy? Mommy's coming home.

323
00:23:41,178 --> 00:23:44,181
[suspenseful music]

324
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:02,406
- I gotta know
everything you know.

325
00:24:07,342 --> 00:24:10,000
[wistful music]

326
00:25:28,837 --> 00:25:31,288
[soft music]

327
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,442
[neon crackles]

328
00:26:06,772 --> 00:26:08,118
Hello, Mr. Bear.

329
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:27,309
[Alice sobs]

330
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:33,868
God.

331
00:26:41,323 --> 00:26:43,809
[Alice sighs]

332
00:26:46,052 --> 00:26:46,881
Oh, Tracy.

333
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:56,304
- "Kabuki killer takes a break."

334
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:04,484
Fat chance, huh, guys?

335
00:27:06,176 --> 00:27:08,212
Yeah. Okay, just a little bit.

336
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,699
You gotta be up early.

337
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:22,364
[suspenseful music]

338
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,960
- [Man] Mrs. Lundgren?

339
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,789
- What?

340
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,275
Who is that?

341
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:39,381
- Uh, my name's Kurt Williams.

342
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:40,520
Um, detective.

343
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,695
Ravenswood County Homicide.

344
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:43,558
- You're a cop?

345
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:46,423
- Some people seem
to think so, ma'am.

346
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:50,013
- Do you usually break
into people's homes?

347
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,535
- Well, no ma'am, but I knocked
and the door swing open.

348
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:58,677
I identified myself and called
out, but nobody responded,

349
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,471
so I figured I'd
better take a look.

350
00:28:02,991 --> 00:28:04,890
- Okay, you're here.
What do you want?

351
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:09,101
- Uh, you want me to
turn on the lights?

352
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:10,205
- When I'm ready.

353
00:28:15,314 --> 00:28:18,731
- Okay. You mind if I
ask you a few questions?

354
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:25,669
Can you tell me anything about
the man who attacked you?

355
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:29,086
- Wait a minute. You're the
cop who talked to my sister?

356
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:30,191
- Yes ma'am, guilty.

357
00:28:31,606 --> 00:28:34,609
- What can I tell you about the
bastard? He killed my child.

358
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,232
- But he didn't kill you.

359
00:28:39,027 --> 00:28:40,926
And that makes you
very, very special.

360
00:28:41,996 --> 00:28:44,239
- That makes me special?

361
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:47,035
- You're the only person who
survived the elevator attacks.

362
00:28:47,035 --> 00:28:50,280
It's curious, isn't it? Kind
of makes you stop and think.

363
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,764
- Just catch the guy, okay?

364
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:54,871
- Listen, do you mind if I
turn on the lights in here?

365
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:56,769
- What's the matter,
Detective? Afraid of the dark?

366
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:58,737
- Depends on who's
in the dark with me.

367
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:05,157
At the time of the attack,

368
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,608
your husband and
you were separated.

369
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:12,198
And you'd filed for
divorce, is that correct?

370
00:29:12,198 --> 00:29:13,752
How'd he feel about that?

371
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,961
- I don't know, you'll
have to ask him.

372
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:18,101
- I've tried asking him.
He wouldn't talk to me.

373
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:20,413
Would you consider your
husband a jealous man?

374
00:29:22,864 --> 00:29:24,141
- Are you suggesting my husband

375
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:25,418
had something to do
with these murders?

376
00:29:25,418 --> 00:29:26,868
- No, no-

377
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:28,490
- You think my husband
could murder our daughter?

378
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,837
- I didn't say that, ma'am.

379
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,772
- Look at that.
Can you see that?

380
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:38,259
That's a picture of a
man and his daughter.

381
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:40,917
A daughter he loved more
than anything in this world.

382
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,784
Tracy was burned
alive, for God's sakes.

383
00:29:50,443 --> 00:29:51,444
- It's okay.

384
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,726
I know you must be
in a lot of pain.

385
00:29:57,726 --> 00:29:59,487
- Get out of here. I
want you out of my house.

386
00:29:59,487 --> 00:30:02,110
- If you can just let
me explain what I need.

387
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,629
- Leave, now!

388
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:05,527
- Okay, I'm leaving.

389
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:09,048
I'm terribly sorry if I upset
you in any way, Mrs. Lundgren.

390
00:30:09,048 --> 00:30:10,153
Good evening.

391
00:30:19,196 --> 00:30:20,715
- Alice?

392
00:30:20,715 --> 00:30:23,822
Hey, what are you doing in
the dark, farming mushrooms?

393
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,031
- Talking to your cop.
Didn't you see him?

394
00:30:26,031 --> 00:30:27,549
He was just here.

395
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:29,758
- I guess I just missed him.

396
00:30:29,758 --> 00:30:32,416
My cop, in the dark?
Now, that's a bit kinky.

397
00:30:33,935 --> 00:30:35,454
So what did he want from you?

398
00:30:35,454 --> 00:30:39,078
- Oh, it was just all these
dumb personal questions.

399
00:30:39,078 --> 00:30:41,840
I've been through this all
before. I'd hoped it was over.

400
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,394
I don't know. It's okay.

401
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:46,845
- Well, good!

402
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,606
Now I want you to put on some
makeup and get ready to go.

403
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:52,505
- Go? Where?

404
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:54,335
- Out to dinner, you nut.

405
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:56,889
We are going to
celebrate your new job.

406
00:30:58,063 --> 00:31:00,168
Well, actually,
your job interview,

407
00:31:00,168 --> 00:31:02,032
but with your resume,
you're sure to get it.

408
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:03,896
- What are you talking
about? What job interview?

409
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:06,726
- At Wexler Burns. The PR firm?

410
00:31:06,726 --> 00:31:09,971
I set up an interview for
you tomorrow at eight.

411
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:11,490
- Wait a minute, tomorrow?

412
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,630
- Yeah. Can we
have some wine now?

413
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,323
[both laugh]

414
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,853
[foreboding music]

415
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:01,816
- What are you...

416
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:03,887
[woman squeals]

417
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:05,716
Let go of me! Help me!

418
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:09,444
[woman screaming]

419
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,832
[ominous music]

420
00:32:33,227 --> 00:32:36,333
- Whatever, let's just have
some dinner, all right?

421
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:38,128
- [Alice] All right,
you convinced me.

422
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:41,856
- Great.

423
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:43,513
Now, I know a nice little
place right by Victor's condo.

424
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:45,964
Let's see if he'll join us.
- No, Kathy.

425
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,000
- Alice, he's dying to see you.

426
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,243
- No. I mean it.

427
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:52,108
- You're not still
planning to go through

428
00:32:52,108 --> 00:32:53,212
with this divorce, are you?

429
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:54,144
Not now?

430
00:32:55,283 --> 00:32:57,492
- Yes, I am.

431
00:32:57,492 --> 00:32:59,908
- But after everything that's
happened, how could you?

432
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:01,738
- Nothing has happened
to make me change my mind

433
00:33:01,738 --> 00:33:03,222
about being married to Victor.

434
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:06,915
- Alice.

435
00:33:08,952 --> 00:33:10,712
I don't think you know
how lucky you are.

436
00:33:10,712 --> 00:33:12,128
Victor really loves you.

437
00:33:12,128 --> 00:33:13,853
- I know, but that's
not a good enough reason

438
00:33:13,853 --> 00:33:15,200
to stay married.

439
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,684
I don't love him.

440
00:33:17,892 --> 00:33:19,204
Not anymore.

441
00:33:19,204 --> 00:33:20,032
- But...

442
00:33:20,895 --> 00:33:23,415
He misses Tracy so much.

443
00:33:25,244 --> 00:33:27,039
Victor's never lost
anything before.

444
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,628
If he loses you too
it'll just kill him.

445
00:33:29,628 --> 00:33:32,734
- Being married to Victor
won't bring Tracy back.

446
00:33:32,734 --> 00:33:34,288
- It's just that...

447
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:38,119
[soft music]

448
00:33:39,224 --> 00:33:40,225
I miss her too.

449
00:33:41,778 --> 00:33:42,848
That's why I...

450
00:33:44,332 --> 00:33:46,714
I couldn't put away
the things in her room.

451
00:33:48,543 --> 00:33:51,339
I don't know, I...

452
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:52,340
I tried.

453
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:54,791
But it was...

454
00:33:56,896 --> 00:33:58,346
It was worse than the funeral.

455
00:33:58,346 --> 00:34:00,762
It was like killing
her all over again.

456
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:04,180
I'm sorry.

457
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,285
- Shh, shh.

458
00:34:06,285 --> 00:34:07,114
It's okay.

459
00:34:09,702 --> 00:34:12,533
That's something for me to
do. You've been wonderful.

460
00:34:13,672 --> 00:34:15,743
Took care of the house.
You took care of me.

461
00:34:17,124 --> 00:34:17,986
Really.

462
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:22,819
- Alice.

463
00:34:26,443 --> 00:34:29,205
Victor has been more
help than you know.

464
00:34:30,723 --> 00:34:33,692
- I know, Kathy, I know.
He means well, but...

465
00:34:36,453 --> 00:34:38,524
Look, let's not talk about
it anymore, all right?

466
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:44,944
Come on.

467
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,982
Let's go out to dinner.

468
00:34:47,982 --> 00:34:52,987
- Okay.

469
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,750
- [Kurt] They'll never
learn. Stupid people.

470
00:35:06,276 --> 00:35:09,279
[suspenseful music]

471
00:35:43,762 --> 00:35:45,350
- You coming, lady?

472
00:35:47,006 --> 00:35:49,319
[Tracy giggles]

473
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:51,873
[man groans]

474
00:35:51,873 --> 00:35:54,290
[Alice gasps]

475
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:56,982
[Tracy squeals]

476
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:18,797
- Excuse me.

477
00:36:18,797 --> 00:36:21,144
I have this interview this
morning in the penthouse,

478
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:24,699
but I can't take the elevator
because I have a phobia.

479
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:25,631
- A what?

480
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:27,081
- A phobia.
- Phobia? Okay.

481
00:36:27,081 --> 00:36:29,290
- Yes, and I was wondering
if I could walk up.

482
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:33,605
- Walk up to the penthouse?
Lady, that's 13 flights.

483
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:34,744
- Well, I know, but I was...

484
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:36,228
Well, won't you help me, please?

485
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:38,886
- Okay, okay, all right. I'll
walk up the stairs with you.

486
00:36:38,886 --> 00:36:39,714
- Thank you.

487
00:36:41,337 --> 00:36:43,856
[guard sighs]

488
00:36:46,307 --> 00:36:49,793
- Here you go, lady.
Last stop, penthouse.

489
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:54,073
Ladies' foundations,
lingerie, and hosiery.

490
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:55,937
And heart attacks.

491
00:36:55,937 --> 00:36:57,076
- Here, thanks.

492
00:36:57,076 --> 00:36:58,561
- Oh, thank you.

493
00:36:58,561 --> 00:37:00,459
You know, I never climbed
all the way up here before,

494
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:04,222
and I'll tell you, ain't never
gonna do it again either.

495
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,982
- Well, I appreciate
it. Thank you.

496
00:37:07,777 --> 00:37:09,330
- I'm taking the elevator down.

497
00:37:13,507 --> 00:37:16,682
- Hi, I'm Alice Lundgren.
I'm here for my interview.

498
00:37:16,682 --> 00:37:18,512
- [Receptionist]
Please, have a seat.

499
00:37:20,168 --> 00:37:23,102
[workers chatting]

500
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,140
Would you like some coffee?

501
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,831
- Um, sure. Thank you.

502
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,851
Kathy? Good news.

503
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:50,751
I start tomorrow.
Yeah, I got it.

504
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:52,200
[doorbell rings]

505
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,443
Could you hold on a second?
Someone's at the door.

506
00:37:53,443 --> 00:37:54,272
Actually, I'll call
you back, all right?

507
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,790
Great, thanks. Bye.

508
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,619
Coming!

509
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:03,108
Victor.

510
00:38:03,108 --> 00:38:04,661
- Alice.

511
00:38:04,661 --> 00:38:06,284
- You're not
supposed to be here.

512
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,252
- I know, I know, it's
just, uh... [sighs]

513
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:10,771
Christ, Alice, I miss you.

514
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,983
- Well, that's
nice of you to say,

515
00:38:15,983 --> 00:38:18,019
but I'm not ready
to see you yet.

516
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:23,542
- You sure? I mean, don't
you want to invite me in?

517
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:25,164
[laughs] Come on.

518
00:38:25,164 --> 00:38:27,822
- Look, I'm sorry. I'm
really busy right now.

519
00:38:27,822 --> 00:38:29,203
I start a new job tomorrow.

520
00:38:30,135 --> 00:38:30,963
- I know.

521
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,828
- Oh.

522
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:35,243
Damn you.

523
00:38:35,243 --> 00:38:37,349
Damn you, Victor! I
don't need your help!

524
00:38:38,764 --> 00:38:40,870
- Alice, the first thing
the psychiatric review board

525
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,631
is gonna look at is whether or
not you can hold down a job.

526
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:45,806
- And you don't
think I know that?

527
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:47,808
I planned on getting a job,

528
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,190
but I could've gotten one on
my own, without your help.

529
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:56,230
That's what I need right
now, to be on my own.

530
00:38:58,646 --> 00:38:59,716
- Well, uh...

531
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,374
You're still my wife,
you understand that?

532
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:04,100
You're still my goddamn
wife and I'm your husband.

533
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,183
[suspenseful music]

534
00:39:43,484 --> 00:39:46,280
[haunting music]

535
00:39:57,153 --> 00:39:59,224
- Excuse me.

536
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:01,364
Excuse me, please.

537
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:03,918
Excuse me! I need to get off.

538
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:04,747
Pardon me!

539
00:40:07,025 --> 00:40:07,853
Excuse me!

540
00:40:09,614 --> 00:40:10,960
Tracy!

541
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,788
Tracy!

542
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,549
Tracy!

543
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:16,897
Come here! Tracy, come here!

544
00:40:16,897 --> 00:40:18,277
Tracy!

545
00:40:18,277 --> 00:40:19,900
Tracy!

546
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,730
[Alice screaming]

547
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:09,881
Oh, uh...

548
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:19,304
[guard panting]

549
00:41:19,304 --> 00:41:20,512
Thanks again.

550
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:21,996
- Yeah.

551
00:41:21,996 --> 00:41:24,102
But listen, just don't make
a habit out of it, okay?

552
00:41:24,102 --> 00:41:25,517
I got more important
things to do.

553
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:27,001
- I'm sure you do.

554
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:29,694
I'll see if I can't get my boss
to make me up a key. Thanks.

555
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,355
[suspenseful music]

556
00:41:36,355 --> 00:41:38,668
Tracy?

557
00:41:38,668 --> 00:41:39,773
Hello? Tracy?

558
00:41:43,362 --> 00:41:44,156
Tracy?

559
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,298
Tracy!

560
00:41:50,162 --> 00:41:50,956
Tracy!

561
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:55,892
- Jill. You okay, honey?

562
00:41:55,892 --> 00:41:58,067
Do you enjoy frightening
little girls?

563
00:42:00,483 --> 00:42:02,071
- No, I'm sorry.
I thought she...

564
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:06,006
She looked like my little girl.
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

565
00:42:15,084 --> 00:42:16,706
- I suppose there's
no harm done.

566
00:42:17,604 --> 00:42:20,123
[bell chimes]

567
00:42:21,469 --> 00:42:22,678
Come on, honey.

568
00:42:44,492 --> 00:42:46,943
- Okay, I know we
promised you tomorrow.

569
00:42:46,943 --> 00:42:49,877
Don't worry. We'll
have it by tomorrow.

570
00:42:51,189 --> 00:42:53,225
Go over it again line by line

571
00:42:53,225 --> 00:42:54,779
and see what you
can come up with.

572
00:42:54,779 --> 00:42:56,125
- Reporting for
duty, Ms. Wilkes.

573
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,679
- Oh, please. Call me
Midge, everybody does.

574
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,198
- Okay, Midge.

575
00:43:00,198 --> 00:43:02,027
- Welcome to Wexler Burns,
Alice. Glad you could join us.

576
00:43:02,027 --> 00:43:03,408
- Thanks. It's nice to be here.

577
00:43:03,408 --> 00:43:06,135
- Well, come on. I'll
give you the tour.

578
00:43:06,135 --> 00:43:09,241
This is the reception area.
- Mm-hmm.

579
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:10,380
- This will be your office.

580
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,692
- Mm, that's nice.
- Mm.

581
00:43:13,142 --> 00:43:16,248
Excuse my portable phone,
but I feel naked without it.

582
00:43:16,248 --> 00:43:18,423
The restrooms are
way down at the end.

583
00:43:18,423 --> 00:43:20,045
We're doing some
construction down there

584
00:43:20,045 --> 00:43:23,186
to make way for a
new executive row.

585
00:43:23,186 --> 00:43:25,188
Come on, let me show
you the media room.

586
00:43:26,707 --> 00:43:30,193
Here we are. It's
state-of-the-art,
completely soundproof.

587
00:43:30,193 --> 00:43:32,264
We use it for
viewing videotapes,

588
00:43:32,264 --> 00:43:33,783
client meetings,
that kind of thing.

589
00:43:33,783 --> 00:43:35,302
- Oh, it's great.
I love the artwork.

590
00:43:35,302 --> 00:43:36,544
[phone rings]
- Excuse me a moment.

591
00:43:36,544 --> 00:43:38,063
Sure.

592
00:43:38,063 --> 00:43:39,651
- Yes?

593
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:40,618
Hi, Jim.

594
00:43:41,964 --> 00:43:44,069
Of course I know how
important this is to you.

595
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:47,348
In fact, we've hired a new
writer to handle the overflow.

596
00:43:48,556 --> 00:43:51,767
Right. Well, I'll have
to find that for you.

597
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:53,044
Can you hold on a second?

598
00:43:57,393 --> 00:43:58,187
Come on.

599
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,639
We're working on a publicity
kit for a new horror movie

600
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,469
and I told the client we'd
have it finished by tomorrow.

601
00:44:04,469 --> 00:44:05,919
- Is there anything I can do?

602
00:44:05,919 --> 00:44:07,575
- Only about a million things.

603
00:44:07,575 --> 00:44:09,612
Listen, take a
look at these bios.

604
00:44:09,612 --> 00:44:12,201
See if you can condense
them to a paragraph each.

605
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:13,754
I'll join you in a
bit in your office.

606
00:44:13,754 --> 00:44:14,617
- Okay, great.

607
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:18,621
- Jim? Yes, I've got
the file right here.

608
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:25,214
- Ah, the joys of employment.

609
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:32,704
[suspenseful music]

610
00:44:51,343 --> 00:44:54,450
[workers catcalling]

611
00:44:55,313 --> 00:44:57,418
[Alice laughs]

612
00:44:57,418 --> 00:44:58,799
Cute, guys. Cute.

613
00:45:04,218 --> 00:45:07,221
[suspenseful music]

614
00:45:08,395 --> 00:45:12,813
- [Tracy] Mommy, Mommy?
Where are you, Mommy?

615
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:13,676
Mommy?

616
00:45:15,402 --> 00:45:18,992
- Get ahold of yourself,
Alice. She's dead.

617
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:22,581
- [Tracy] Come to me, Mommy.

618
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:27,690
- Tracy?

619
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:31,418
Tracy, are you in there?

620
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:35,594
[yelps] Oh god, you scared me.

621
00:45:35,594 --> 00:45:37,735
- I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to frighten you.

622
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:39,633
Are you, uh...

623
00:45:42,636 --> 00:45:44,707
You must be the new girl.

624
00:45:44,707 --> 00:45:46,157
- Huh? Oh!

625
00:45:46,157 --> 00:45:48,849
Yes, I am. I was just looking
for the ladies room and...

626
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:50,264
- Oh. Well, this is it here.

627
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:53,543
We've been having so much
construction going here lately

628
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:55,097
that we've all been using this.

629
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,791
But don't go in here. That's
the construction area.

630
00:46:01,068 --> 00:46:04,589
Someone keeps changing
the signs. As a joke.

631
00:46:06,211 --> 00:46:09,732
I think it's one of the
secretaries, or the workmen.

632
00:46:09,732 --> 00:46:10,733
- Yeah, probably.

633
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:15,773
- But don't worry, this
door locks from the inside.

634
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,636
- It's okay. I didn't need
it now anyway, actually.

635
00:46:17,636 --> 00:46:20,467
I just wanted to know where
it was. You know, for later.

636
00:46:20,467 --> 00:46:21,606
- I...

637
00:46:21,606 --> 00:46:22,503
Sure.
- Yeah.

638
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:31,961
- Mrs. Lundgren?

639
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,484
I still gotta ask
you a few questions.

640
00:46:37,484 --> 00:46:39,382
- Look, this is my
first day at a new job.

641
00:46:39,382 --> 00:46:41,419
Can't you just leave
me alone, please?

642
00:46:41,419 --> 00:46:44,491
- I'm very sorry to
disturb you. I really am.

643
00:46:44,491 --> 00:46:46,113
I got no choice though.

644
00:46:46,113 --> 00:46:47,805
I mean, couldn't
we talk over lunch?

645
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,289
- I don't think
so. I'm very busy.

646
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:50,324
- You gotta eat!

647
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:53,811
I mean, you know, we could
eat and we could talk

648
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,019
and I could cross my heart

649
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:57,573
that I'm not gonna ask
any cop questions and...

650
00:46:57,573 --> 00:46:59,092
You know, nothing fancy.

651
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:03,061
[soft music]

652
00:47:06,582 --> 00:47:08,687
- [Alice] So. You eat
on roofs very often?

653
00:47:10,172 --> 00:47:11,829
- Well, as often as I can, yeah.

654
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,658
It's a nice way to
get away from people,

655
00:47:13,658 --> 00:47:14,866
get some peace and quiet.

656
00:47:16,695 --> 00:47:18,870
You got a lot of peace and
quiet in the hospital, I'll bet.

657
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,872
- If you can call being shot up

658
00:47:20,872 --> 00:47:23,323
with Thorazine peace
and quiet, then yeah,

659
00:47:23,323 --> 00:47:26,050
I had peace and
quiet, a lot of it.

660
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,017
- Why'd you come back
to work so quick?

661
00:47:28,017 --> 00:47:30,123
I mean, you don't need the
money, that's for sure.

662
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:32,988
- I like to write.

663
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,130
You sound like my husband.

664
00:47:38,786 --> 00:47:40,271
He never wanted me to work.

665
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:42,860
Wanted me to stay home and
be his good little girl.

666
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,551
- Uh, that maybe
have something to do

667
00:47:44,551 --> 00:47:45,966
with your filing for divorce?

668
00:47:47,795 --> 00:47:48,624
- Partly.

669
00:47:49,487 --> 00:47:50,315
- Yeah.

670
00:47:51,627 --> 00:47:52,731
What was his response?

671
00:47:54,595 --> 00:47:57,875
- I thought you weren't
gonna ask any cop questions.

672
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,221
- I slipped. I
can't help myself.

673
00:47:59,221 --> 00:48:00,912
I'm just a naturally
nosy person, you know?

674
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:03,190
But, I mean, I care about what
you've been going through.

675
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:05,261
I care about you. I
care a lot about you.

676
00:48:06,814 --> 00:48:07,643
- Thanks.

677
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:13,545
- Well, so now that I've
slipped once already

678
00:48:13,545 --> 00:48:15,168
and that we're
such close friends,

679
00:48:15,168 --> 00:48:17,584
could I please just ask
one little cop question?

680
00:48:21,105 --> 00:48:22,623
- All right, but get
it out of your system

681
00:48:22,623 --> 00:48:24,177
because the next time
I answer questions

682
00:48:24,177 --> 00:48:25,350
it's gonna take a lot more

683
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,904
than a deli sandwich
and a pickle.

684
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,803
- In the last year there
have been eight killings.

685
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,392
Did you know any of these people

686
00:48:32,392 --> 00:48:34,773
or was there any connection
with the victims at all?

687
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:38,536
- None.

688
00:48:43,265 --> 00:48:45,163
- [Kurt] You gonna finish
that pickle or what?

689
00:48:45,163 --> 00:48:47,890
- Let's see, when does
he get in? Okay, good.

690
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:51,204
[Alice and Kurt laughing]

691
00:48:51,204 --> 00:48:52,515
- I really gotta
get back to work.

692
00:48:52,515 --> 00:48:54,690
- Okay. Thank you
very much for lunch.

693
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,174
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Goodbye.

694
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:02,008
- An interesting
man. Close friend?

695
00:49:02,008 --> 00:49:03,699
- Not really.

696
00:49:03,699 --> 00:49:05,908
- Listen, the cassette
on that film came in.

697
00:49:05,908 --> 00:49:07,841
Take a look and give
me a two-page synopsis,

698
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:09,774
say, by five today?

699
00:49:09,774 --> 00:49:10,948
- You got it.
- Okay.

700
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:15,469
[employees chatting]

701
00:49:26,687 --> 00:49:28,172
- Anyone in there?

[Alice moans]

704
00:50:15,978 --> 00:50:16,979
- Hi, Mommy.

[Alice gasps]

706
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:25,643
[sighs] What's...

[door opens]

708
00:50:32,753 --> 00:50:35,135
- Alice? Is everything okay?

709
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,656
I mean, are you all right?

710
00:50:38,656 --> 00:50:40,002
- No. No, I'm fine.

711
00:50:41,003 --> 00:50:42,556
- Hey!
- Don't touch that!

712
00:50:42,556 --> 00:50:44,179
- Why not? It's mine.

713
00:50:45,421 --> 00:50:46,940
- It's yours?
- Yes!

714
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,287
It was given to me at last
year's office Christmas party.

715
00:50:49,287 --> 00:50:50,564
I lost it about a week ago,

716
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:52,601
but I didn't think
it was in here.

717
00:50:53,878 --> 00:50:56,191
I know it's childish to
wear a charm bracelet,

718
00:50:56,191 --> 00:50:59,090
but honey, I can all use
all the luck I can get.

719
00:51:03,819 --> 00:51:06,718
You know, you really
should lock this door.

720
00:51:06,718 --> 00:51:09,411
This is the only restroom
in the office right now.

721
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:11,344
Are you sure you're all right?

722
00:51:11,344 --> 00:51:13,656
I mean, you look
awfully pale to me.

723
00:51:13,656 --> 00:51:16,280
- I think it's just a case
of the first-day jitters.

724
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,558
I'll be fine as soon as I
get started, I'm sure of it.

725
00:51:18,558 --> 00:51:21,078
In fact, I'm gonna look
at that tape right now.

726
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:21,940
- Okay.

727
00:51:24,736 --> 00:51:27,291
[pills rattle]

728
00:51:42,444 --> 00:51:47,449
[baby crying]
[suspenseful music]

729
00:51:58,701 --> 00:52:00,738
[girl screams]

730
00:52:00,738 --> 00:52:03,120
[baby cries]

731
00:52:18,514 --> 00:52:21,448
[baby cries]

732
00:52:21,448 --> 00:52:22,760
[killer growls]

733
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,487
[girl screaming]

734
00:52:31,009 --> 00:52:33,598
[killer roars]

735
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,912
[girl moaning]

736
00:52:36,912 --> 00:52:38,500
- Oh, that bastard!

737
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,192
That bastard!

738
00:52:50,097 --> 00:52:53,239
Police department. Get
me the police department.

739
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:54,999
Yes, it's an emergency!

740
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,419
Hello, I'd like to speak to
Detective Williams, please.

741
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,768
Kurt? It's Alice Lundgren.

742
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:08,495
Alice Lundgren.
What do you mean?

743
00:53:09,703 --> 00:53:11,049
What are you talking about?

744
00:53:13,293 --> 00:53:15,192
Oh, I see. I'm sorry.

745
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,710
I must have the wrong
Detective Williams.

746
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:19,817
I was trying to get ahold
of Detective Kurt Williams.

747
00:53:19,817 --> 00:53:20,645
Homicide.

748
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:25,202
What do you mean? There isn't?

749
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:27,376
Are you sure?

750
00:53:29,413 --> 00:53:31,173
No, no, I'm fine.

751
00:53:31,173 --> 00:53:33,796
I just must've gotten the
name wrong, that's all.

752
00:53:33,796 --> 00:53:35,350
No, I'm sorry. Nevermind.

753
00:53:44,704 --> 00:53:45,532
- Alice?

754
00:53:48,915 --> 00:53:51,642
[haunting music]

755
00:54:00,306 --> 00:54:01,134
Oh! Jesus.

756
00:54:11,006 --> 00:54:13,422
God, what is happening to me?

757
00:54:16,908 --> 00:54:19,532
- [Tracy] Don't cry, Mommy.

758
00:54:19,532 --> 00:54:20,981
- No!

759
00:54:20,981 --> 00:54:24,744
No, this isn't happening!
It's not happening!

760
00:54:24,744 --> 00:54:29,093
- [Tracy] Please don't
cry. I'll take care of you.

761
00:54:29,093 --> 00:54:31,509
[soft music]

762
00:54:38,136 --> 00:54:39,759
[Alice laughs]

763
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:41,278
- Oh, honey.

764
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,106
Oh, Tracy.

765
00:54:46,352 --> 00:54:48,699
Oh, Mommy loves you so much.

766
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:54,912
Don't leave me again.
Don't leave me ever.

767
00:54:54,912 --> 00:54:57,294
- I didn't want to
leave you, Mommy.

768
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,848
The angel took me away.

769
00:54:59,848 --> 00:55:02,816
I wanted to stay with you.

770
00:55:03,886 --> 00:55:04,887
- Oh, honey!

771
00:55:06,026 --> 00:55:07,442
Oh, honey!

772
00:55:07,442 --> 00:55:08,443
Oh, my baby.

773
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,758
- Alice! Open the door!

774
00:55:13,758 --> 00:55:15,173
Let us in! Alice!

775
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:20,627
- Come on, honey.

776
00:55:20,627 --> 00:55:22,905
- What's the matter,
Mommy? Are you sick?

777
00:55:22,905 --> 00:55:24,976
- Mrs. Lundgren, let us in!
- No, honey, I'm okay.

778
00:55:24,976 --> 00:55:26,771
- [Man] Mrs. Lundgren!
Are you okay?

779
00:55:27,945 --> 00:55:30,706
[pounding at door]
[doorknob rattling]

780
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:34,745
- [Midge] Alice, honey, we'll
help you. Open the door.

781
00:55:34,745 --> 00:55:36,540
- It's locked!

782
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,231
Door's locked!

783
00:55:38,231 --> 00:55:39,059
Oh!

784
00:55:42,477 --> 00:55:43,340
Tracy?

785
00:55:44,513 --> 00:55:45,342
Tracy!

786
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,793
Tracy!

787
00:55:48,793 --> 00:55:50,208
Oh god!

788
00:55:50,208 --> 00:55:51,037
No! Tracy!

789
00:55:52,279 --> 00:55:53,108
Tracy!

790
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,766
Oh god!

791
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:57,354
Tracy!

792
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,217
Oh god, how could you?

793
00:56:00,253 --> 00:56:02,600
How could you lose her again?

794
00:56:03,601 --> 00:56:05,292
- I'll call an ambulance.

795
00:56:05,292 --> 00:56:08,882
- [Midge] Good. It's
okay, Alice, it's okay.

796
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:10,988
- No it's not okay!

797
00:56:10,988 --> 00:56:14,371
He took my baby! He
took my baby again!

798
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,889
- [Midge] Alice, did
you take anything?

799
00:56:15,889 --> 00:56:17,788
Are you on something, honey?

800
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:20,411
- It's not my fault.

801
00:56:24,726 --> 00:56:25,554
Yes it is.

802
00:56:27,073 --> 00:56:28,557
It's all my fault.

803
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:32,181
- Paramedics are on their way.

804
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:34,391
- [Alice] It's all my fault.

805
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,358
It's all my fault.

806
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:39,637
- I wonder what happened to her?

807
00:56:39,637 --> 00:56:42,744
- Another 25 milligrams
of Thorazine.

808
00:56:48,335 --> 00:56:49,647
Hit her with it.

809
00:56:52,132 --> 00:56:54,825
[Alice screams]

810
00:57:03,143 --> 00:57:03,972
Alice?

811
00:57:07,044 --> 00:57:07,872
Alice?

812
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:11,635
Alice?

813
00:57:14,672 --> 00:57:16,018
Can you hear me?

814
00:57:20,022 --> 00:57:21,265
Alice?
- Uh-huh?

815
00:57:22,577 --> 00:57:23,509
Where am I?

816
00:57:24,544 --> 00:57:27,754
- Everything's gonna be okay.

817
00:57:27,754 --> 00:57:30,032
- Where's my baby?
- Alice! Alice!

818
00:57:30,032 --> 00:57:32,587
Listen. Listen, listen, listen.

819
00:57:33,726 --> 00:57:34,899
Alice, listen.

820
00:57:39,317 --> 00:57:40,284
- Oh, it's you.

821
00:57:41,216 --> 00:57:43,977
- That's right. That's right.

822
00:57:43,977 --> 00:57:44,806
Leave us.

823
00:57:52,089 --> 00:57:54,332
You gave us quite a
scare, young lady.

824
00:57:54,332 --> 00:57:55,472
- I bet I did.

825
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,096
- Want to tell me what happened?

826
00:58:02,824 --> 00:58:05,930
- [laughs] Hasn't
anyone told you yet?

827
00:58:07,173 --> 00:58:08,657
- I'd rather have you tell me.

828
00:58:11,108 --> 00:58:12,558
Alice?

829
00:58:12,558 --> 00:58:13,455
- I'd rather not.

830
00:58:16,389 --> 00:58:18,495
- The paramedics said
you were incoherent.

831
00:58:19,979 --> 00:58:21,567
Something about your daughter.

832
00:58:23,465 --> 00:58:25,571
Alice, have you been
seeing Tracy again?

833
00:58:27,952 --> 00:58:28,781
Alice?

834
00:58:30,748 --> 00:58:31,577
Alice?

835
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,889
I'm just trying to help you.

836
00:58:36,098 --> 00:58:36,927
Have you?

837
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:43,450
Oh, I'm just so tired.
I can hardly think.

838
00:58:48,007 --> 00:58:50,906
- All right. I understand.

839
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:55,842
Just rest. I'll come
look in on you later.

840
00:59:07,889 --> 00:59:08,855
Mr. Lundgren.

841
00:59:10,477 --> 00:59:12,790
- Ah, Doctor.
- Please sit down.

842
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:13,619
- How is she?

843
00:59:16,207 --> 00:59:18,865
- Well, physically
she'll be fine.

844
00:59:21,212 --> 00:59:22,559
But as you know,

845
00:59:23,732 --> 00:59:25,562
healthy people don't hear voices

846
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,011
and see their dead children.

847
00:59:28,979 --> 00:59:31,257
- So she admitted to
seeing Tracy again?

848
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:34,225
- She absolutely
insisted she had.

849
00:59:36,296 --> 00:59:38,264
- Well, what's this
come down to, Doctor?

850
00:59:38,264 --> 00:59:40,991
I mean, is she gonna get better
or is she gonna get worse?

851
00:59:40,991 --> 00:59:43,683
- It's extremely
difficult to say.

852
00:59:43,683 --> 00:59:46,341
But based on this
most recent episode,

853
00:59:46,341 --> 00:59:48,308
I'm afraid the
psychological review board

854
00:59:48,308 --> 00:59:49,896
will insist that
we keep her here

855
00:59:49,896 --> 00:59:52,140
for further evaluation
and treatment.

856
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,417
- I understand.

857
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:55,764
- I want to assure
you that once again

858
00:59:55,764 --> 00:59:58,595
I will personally supervise and
make sure she gets the best-

859
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,149
- Okay, Doctor, what
room's Alice in?

860
01:00:01,149 --> 01:00:02,599
- Excuse me? Who are you?

861
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:06,568
- Mr. Lundgren,
Detective Williams.

862
01:00:08,121 --> 01:00:09,536
- Detective?

863
01:00:09,536 --> 01:00:11,815
- He's investigating
the elevator killings.

864
01:00:11,815 --> 01:00:14,611
- Right. Look, let
me make myself clear.

865
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,923
Nobody wants the son of a
bitch caught more than I do,

866
01:00:16,923 --> 01:00:19,650
but I don't think it's a
good time to disturb my wife.

867
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:22,032
She's in a very
sensitive condition.

868
01:00:22,032 --> 01:00:22,860
- Yeah.

869
01:00:24,241 --> 01:00:25,311
I'll bet she is.

870
01:00:26,484 --> 01:00:28,555
It's awful about her
relapse, isn't it?

871
01:00:28,555 --> 01:00:29,349
- Yes, it is.

872
01:00:30,765 --> 01:00:34,251
- Yes, it is. I just dropped
in to see how she's doing.

873
01:00:34,251 --> 01:00:35,735
- I've already told you that's-

874
01:00:35,735 --> 01:00:37,564
- You want me to get a court
order? I'll get a court order.

875
01:00:37,564 --> 01:00:39,152
- Court order?

876
01:00:39,152 --> 01:00:40,498
You think you've got just cause,

877
01:00:40,498 --> 01:00:41,638
then you get the hell outta here

878
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,087
and you find your court order.

879
01:00:45,538 --> 01:00:46,988
- Real nice to finally
meet you, Mr. Lundgren.

880
01:00:46,988 --> 01:00:48,127
- Yeah, you bet.

881
01:00:50,163 --> 01:00:52,200
- Good afternoon,
Detective Williams.

882
01:00:57,067 --> 01:00:58,275
- Jesus Christ.

883
01:00:59,517 --> 01:01:00,691
Son of a bitch.

884
01:01:02,141 --> 01:01:04,799
[pensive music]

885
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:13,739
[Alice panting]

886
01:01:15,223 --> 01:01:17,328
[Alice gasps]

887
01:01:17,328 --> 01:01:18,916
- Oh god.

888
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:19,745
Oh god!

889
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,783
It's okay, Alice.

890
01:01:25,095 --> 01:01:27,649
Everyone has nightmares.
You're not crazy.

891
01:01:31,273 --> 01:01:33,172
- [Kurt] No, you're
definitely not crazy.

892
01:01:33,172 --> 01:01:34,035
- Who is that?

893
01:01:37,832 --> 01:01:40,593
- Sanity is just a state of
mind and a point of view.

894
01:01:40,593 --> 01:01:42,422
- What the hell
are you doing here?

895
01:01:42,422 --> 01:01:43,665
- Alice, uh...

896
01:01:43,665 --> 01:01:46,047
Listen, trust me. Just
for a minute, okay?

897
01:01:46,047 --> 01:01:47,186
I think I can help you.

898
01:01:48,912 --> 01:01:50,465
And I hope you can help me.

899
01:01:50,465 --> 01:01:51,604
- Stay right where you are
or I'll push this button

900
01:01:51,604 --> 01:01:53,330
and scream rape.

901
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:55,159
I want to know who
you really are.

902
01:01:55,159 --> 01:01:57,644
- I told you before. My
name's Kurt Williams.

903
01:01:57,644 --> 01:02:00,440
I'm a police detective and
I specialize in homicide.

904
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,581
- I called police headquarters.
They never heard of you.

905
01:02:03,581 --> 01:02:05,169
- Normally I work undercover.

906
01:02:05,169 --> 01:02:07,689
I mean, crack scams,
bunco chicken markets,
stuff like that,

907
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:09,277
and it's pretty nasty stuff.

908
01:02:09,277 --> 01:02:11,141
Think you're gonna call division
and ask 'em if I'm a cop

909
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:12,487
and they're gonna tell you?

910
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:17,664
- No, I guess not.

911
01:02:17,664 --> 01:02:20,426
- Listen, if you want to
reach me, day or night,

912
01:02:21,668 --> 01:02:22,531
call this number.

913
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:24,879
Okay?

914
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:30,125
I'm kind of obsessed
with your case.

915
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,751
Let me explain that.

916
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:38,133
When you were
attacked, you know,

917
01:02:39,825 --> 01:02:43,345
and you get an instinct for
this kind of thing, it's...

918
01:02:43,345 --> 01:02:46,659
It's hard to explain, but
something wasn't right.

919
01:02:46,659 --> 01:02:48,178
Something just wasn't right.

920
01:02:48,178 --> 01:02:49,558
I mean, I wasn't assigned
to your case or anything,

921
01:02:49,558 --> 01:02:50,905
but I made you my business.

922
01:02:52,838 --> 01:02:55,116
And I gotta be real
honest with you right now.

923
01:02:56,427 --> 01:02:57,739
After six months,

924
01:02:58,947 --> 01:03:00,777
you're nothing but a
file folder downtown

925
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,813
in an overstuffed cabinet.

926
01:03:02,813 --> 01:03:04,228
I think I'm your only shot.

927
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:09,440
- What's different about my
case? It was a random attack.

928
01:03:12,098 --> 01:03:15,067
- You're alive. That's
what makes you special.

929
01:03:17,517 --> 01:03:19,002
And I'm convinced

930
01:03:19,002 --> 01:03:21,521
that it wasn't the elevator
killer that attacked you.

931
01:03:21,521 --> 01:03:22,350
- What?

932
01:03:23,627 --> 01:03:24,870
- It doesn't fit
the profile at all.

933
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,112
He never would've
murdered your kid.

934
01:03:26,112 --> 01:03:28,563
He never would've
left you alive.

935
01:03:28,563 --> 01:03:31,290
Listen to me. I need
information from you.

936
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:32,705
You're the only person left.

937
01:03:35,328 --> 01:03:36,295
- You've come to
the wrong person.

938
01:03:36,295 --> 01:03:37,779
I can't tell you anything.

939
01:03:38,918 --> 01:03:40,540
I don't even know
what's real anymore.

940
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:42,957
Maybe I am crazy.

941
01:03:46,098 --> 01:03:50,033
- Excuse me for asking, okay?
Were you taking anything?

942
01:03:50,033 --> 01:03:51,379
- Nothing like that, no.

943
01:03:52,483 --> 01:03:53,933
- But you were taking something?

944
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,350
- The doctor here
gave me some Valium

945
01:03:57,350 --> 01:03:58,835
that I've been carrying
around and, you know,

946
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,629
today was the first time I
felt like I really needed one.

947
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:01,838
That's all.

948
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,011
- How many did you take?

949
01:04:03,874 --> 01:04:05,082
- Just two, I think.

950
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:08,637
No, I'm sure. I only took two.

951
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:10,260
- Anything else?
Anything at all?

952
01:04:11,157 --> 01:04:12,400
- Nope. Nothing.

953
01:04:15,921 --> 01:04:18,406
[soft music]

954
01:04:18,406 --> 01:04:21,788
Tell me the truth. Do
you think I'm crazy?

955
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,206
- I wouldn't say
you're crazy at all.

956
01:04:25,206 --> 01:04:26,586
- You know what I'm asking.

957
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,728
I saw my daughter
today. I know I did.

958
01:04:31,798 --> 01:04:33,870
And I also know she's dead.

959
01:04:38,322 --> 01:04:40,290
- Well, it is possible.

960
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:42,948
I mean, that you actually
did see her in your mind.

961
01:04:42,948 --> 01:04:44,018
It can be very real.

962
01:04:44,018 --> 01:04:46,606
- Not in my mind. I saw her.

963
01:04:48,263 --> 01:04:49,092
I saw her.

964
01:04:52,612 --> 01:04:54,235
- Well, I don't
know what to say.

965
01:04:55,615 --> 01:04:58,032
Unless you believe in ghosts.

966
01:04:58,032 --> 01:04:59,205
- It's wasn't...

967
01:04:59,205 --> 01:05:01,828
[knock at door]

968
01:05:05,453 --> 01:05:07,938
- Knock, knock. Can I come in?
- Kathy?

969
01:05:07,938 --> 01:05:11,873
- Alice! You told me you were
over this and I believed you.

970
01:05:11,873 --> 01:05:14,462
I help you get a job
and you flip out.

971
01:05:14,462 --> 01:05:16,878
The review board will have no
choice but to commit you again

972
01:05:16,878 --> 01:05:18,328
and this time for keeps.

973
01:05:20,123 --> 01:05:22,642
- Why is everybody so
convinced I'm insane?

974
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,507
- Because.

975
01:05:25,507 --> 01:05:30,029
Sane people don't go around
seeing ghosts. That's why.

976
01:05:30,029 --> 01:05:31,928
- I didn't see a ghost!

977
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,722
I saw Tracy.

978
01:05:33,722 --> 01:05:35,138
Alive.

979
01:05:35,138 --> 01:05:36,829
- Alice-
- I touched her.

980
01:05:38,244 --> 01:05:39,694
I held her in my arms, Kat.

981
01:05:43,077 --> 01:05:44,975
I felt her heart
beating inside her.

982
01:05:46,011 --> 01:05:47,564
- No, you didn't.

983
01:05:47,564 --> 01:05:49,393
Goddamn it, she's dead!

984
01:05:52,155 --> 01:05:53,121
- No, she isn't.

985
01:05:54,157 --> 01:05:56,780
[somber music]

986
01:06:01,198 --> 01:06:02,027
- Alice.

987
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:06,963
They will put you away.

988
01:06:08,481 --> 01:06:09,966
For a long time.

989
01:06:12,175 --> 01:06:13,866
Dr. Meltzner won't
be able to help you

990
01:06:13,866 --> 01:06:15,626
if you won't even help yourself.

991
01:06:19,285 --> 01:06:21,080
I don't want to lose you again.

992
01:06:23,807 --> 01:06:25,429
- And I don't want
to lose Tracy.

993
01:06:27,224 --> 01:06:28,225
I saw her.

994
01:06:33,541 --> 01:06:34,369
- Then...

995
01:06:36,544 --> 01:06:39,029
I don't know what else to say.

996
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,860
- [Alice] You don't
have to say anything.

997
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:51,973
- Alice.

998
01:06:53,285 --> 01:06:54,217
I love you.

999
01:06:59,843 --> 01:07:00,671
- I know you do.

1000
01:07:07,575 --> 01:07:08,679
Take care of yourself.

1001
01:07:10,923 --> 01:07:11,751
- I will.

1002
01:07:12,959 --> 01:07:15,514
And I know as long
as you're here,

1003
01:07:17,102 --> 01:07:18,586
Victor will take care of you.

1004
01:07:31,737 --> 01:07:34,395
[pensive music]

1005
01:07:50,756 --> 01:07:53,103
[Victor whistles]

1006
01:07:53,103 --> 01:07:53,966
- You're late.

1007
01:07:58,212 --> 01:07:59,730
- That for me?

1008
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:00,524
- That's for you.

1009
01:08:01,974 --> 01:08:04,459
So I guess this means you're
gonna get out of Dodge, right?

1010
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:07,083
- I ain't hanging around
here, that's for sure.

1011
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,775
- I was thinking maybe
you'd get a little greedy,

1012
01:08:09,775 --> 01:08:12,536
come back for a little more
and maybe bring the police.

1013
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:17,576
- Mr. Lundgren, we had a deal.

1014
01:08:17,576 --> 01:08:19,923
- Mr. Norton, you had a deal.

1015
01:08:23,685 --> 01:08:24,652
I got a plan.

1016
01:08:26,067 --> 01:08:28,656
- Now wait a minute. You don't
have to do this, you know.

1017
01:08:28,656 --> 01:08:30,278
I mean, I wouldn't talk.

1018
01:08:30,278 --> 01:08:33,178
I mean, you can keep
the money. I won't talk.

1019
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:36,250
- What are you gonna
do, dance for me?

1020
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,941
- Mr. Lundgren, please, no.
- You gonna dance?

1021
01:08:37,941 --> 01:08:39,805
- Mr. Lundgren-
- Why don't you just dance?

1022
01:08:39,805 --> 01:08:42,739
[Norton screaming]

1023
01:08:51,782 --> 01:08:56,787

- [Tracy] Mommy? Are
you coming to get me?

1027
01:09:15,944 --> 01:09:18,464
- Tracy? Where are you, baby?

1028
01:09:18,464 --> 01:09:20,880
- [Tracy] I'm here.
I'm waiting for you.

1029
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,365
- Yes, but where? Where are you?

1030
01:09:22,365 --> 01:09:24,470
- [Tracy] At your office.

[suspenseful music]

1033
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:29,604
- She's on her way.

1034
01:10:32,297 --> 01:10:33,608
Just as we discussed.

1035
01:10:37,992 --> 01:10:41,237
Don't make pointless threats.
We both have too much to lose.

I've been seeing things.
But some of it's true.

down, take a deep breath.

sweetie, it's all right.

Mommy's just still a
little sick, that's all.

- Tracy, come to Mommy.

1168

- Well, it's up
to you, isn't it?

1172
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:35,311
Either we live
together on my terms

1173
01:24:35,311 --> 01:24:36,864

whatever you want.

- And none of this happened,
did it? Do you understand?

1178
01:24:45,735 --> 01:24:47,841
None of it. It's
all in your mind.

Say it.

Now.

1185
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,893
There's not gonna
be a divorce? No!

1186

go the hospital, yes. Say it.

Tracy's gonna remain with me

1191
01:25:19,597 --> 01:25:22,289
and then in time,
Alice, in time,

1192
01:25:24,671 --> 01:25:26,535
then you're going
to come back to me.

1193
01:25:28,364 --> 01:25:31,367
And then you'll be mine forever.

- My choice.

1197
01:25:39,341 --> 01:25:41,412
It's my choice.

1198
01:25:41,412 --> 01:25:43,690
You've already got Tracy.

1199
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:46,934
You've taken everything
from me, Victor!

1200
01:25:46,934 --> 01:25:48,004
My child, my...

1201
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:50,524
And my mind.

1202

She was...

Oh my god.

You burned a child in that oven.

- [grunts] This stupid bitch!

1208
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:15,446
I got a body, a little
body, from the morgue.

1209
01:26:15,446 --> 01:26:16,999
She was already dead.

1210
01:26:16,999 --> 01:26:19,726
- All those other women, dead
because of you? Because of me?

1211
01:26:19,726 --> 01:26:20,934
- I had nothing to do
with the other killings.

1212
01:26:20,934 --> 01:26:23,074
You understand? I didn't
kill anybody else.

1213
01:26:23,074 --> 01:26:23,902
All right?

1214
01:26:27,043 --> 01:26:29,080

Please. Please don't do this.

Please. Come on, baby, I...

I love you.

1226
01:27:04,495 --> 01:27:07,636
I did it because I
love you. I love us!

1227
01:27:10,363 --> 01:27:11,226
I love you.

1228
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:15,402
- Love? Don't say that,
you son of a bitch!

1229
01:27:15,402 --> 01:27:17,715
You don't have the
right to use the word.

1230
01:27:17,715 --> 01:27:21,236
Not after what you did
to me and my child.

1231
01:27:23,997 --> 01:27:28,381
- Alice. I did this
all because I love you!

Oh, darling.

1248
01:28:17,153 --> 01:28:19,535
[gasps] Oh! God, you scared me.

1249
01:28:21,606 --> 01:28:22,849
- Mommy?

1250
01:28:22,849 --> 01:28:25,092
- It's okay, honey.
He's a policeman.

1251
01:28:25,092 --> 01:28:27,578
- Yeah, it's okay
now. It's okay.

1252
01:28:27,578 --> 01:28:28,441
Where's Lundgren?

1253
01:28:29,752 --> 01:28:31,375
- He's dead.

1254
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:33,411
- It was him, wasn't it?

1255
01:28:33,411 --> 01:28:36,241
And he was just using the
other killings to get to you.

1256
01:28:36,241 --> 01:28:38,243
- Yeah. How did you know?

1257
01:28:38,243 --> 01:28:39,175
- I just knew.

1258
01:28:39,175 --> 01:28:41,419
I just knew. It had to be him.

1259
01:28:42,558 --> 01:28:43,456
Come on, let's go.

1260
01:28:44,698 --> 01:28:47,701
[suspenseful music]

1261
01:28:56,020 --> 01:28:58,919
[sighs] I knew it. That bastard.

1262
01:28:58,919 --> 01:29:00,369
I mean, how the
hell he ever thought

1263
01:29:00,369 --> 01:29:01,646
I'd let him get away with
something like that, I mean...

1264
01:29:01,646 --> 01:29:03,924
Well, he's stupid.
He's a stupid man.

1265
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:10,690
There's so much stupidity
in this world, you know?

1266
01:29:10,690 --> 01:29:12,139
God, I hate stupidity.

1267
01:29:12,139 --> 01:29:13,555
I mean, anybody who'd
attack you and your daughter

1268
01:29:13,555 --> 01:29:15,833
has gotta be brainless.

1269
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:17,075
You're good people.

1270
01:29:17,075 --> 01:29:18,180
I mean, the other people
deserve what they got,

1271
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:19,215
but you guys, no.

1272
01:29:20,285 --> 01:29:21,735
No, no, no, no, no.

1273
01:29:21,735 --> 01:29:23,979
And I mean, it was his fault
you went through all this pain.

1274
01:29:23,979 --> 01:29:26,257
At least you're not my
fault. I mean, you know that.

1275
01:29:27,672 --> 01:29:30,779
But it's a difficult situation
because, you know, I mean...

1276
01:29:32,021 --> 01:29:33,678
The cops are gonna
start asking questions

1277
01:29:33,678 --> 01:29:35,231
and inevitably they're gonna...

1278
01:29:36,543 --> 01:29:37,820
Be led to me, and I mean,

1279
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:39,753
you're not gonna be able
to answer the questions.

1280
01:29:39,753 --> 01:29:40,582
There's no way.

1281
01:29:42,066 --> 01:29:42,894
You know?

1282
01:29:44,102 --> 01:29:46,484
A copycat killer,
like your husband,

1283
01:29:46,484 --> 01:29:48,141
is never as good
as the original.

1284
01:29:51,834 --> 01:29:54,147
I mean, this is not something
I want to do. Believe me.

1285
01:29:54,147 --> 01:29:56,805
It's the last thing in
the world I want to do.

1286
01:29:56,805 --> 01:29:59,048
[elevator clanks]

1287
01:29:59,048 --> 01:30:00,878
You know? But I gotta.

1288
01:30:03,605 --> 01:30:05,192
And, uh...

1289
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:07,367
I'll make it as quick as I can.

1290
01:30:07,367 --> 01:30:08,403
[Alice yelps]

1291
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:11,060
[Tracy screams]

1292
01:30:12,614 --> 01:30:15,202
- Stop! [screams]

1293
01:30:15,202 --> 01:30:17,688
[tense music]

1294
01:30:19,586 --> 01:30:20,760
- Aw, come on.

1295
01:30:24,073 --> 01:30:26,628
Don't make it hard on yourself.

1296
01:30:33,842 --> 01:30:35,671
[elevator clanks]

1297
01:30:35,671 --> 01:30:38,260
[Kurt screams]

1298
01:30:46,302 --> 01:30:48,753
[Kurt groans]

1299
01:31:00,903 --> 01:31:02,767
- Tracy, come here!
Come here, baby!

1300
01:31:02,767 --> 01:31:04,562
- Are you okay, Mommy?

1301
01:31:04,562 --> 01:31:07,151
[Kurt screams]

1302
01:31:11,707 --> 01:31:14,227
[Kurt groans]

1303
01:31:18,058 --> 01:31:20,613
Oh, Tracy, come here, baby. Oh!

1304
01:31:27,171 --> 01:31:29,967
It's okay, darling.
Come on, it's okay.

1305
01:31:29,967 --> 01:31:30,899
Come on.

1306
01:31:30,899 --> 01:31:33,557
- Mommy, can we go home now?

1307
01:31:33,557 --> 01:31:34,799
- Yes, darling.

1308
01:31:51,575 --> 01:31:54,232
[ominous music]
