00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
THE EAGLE (2011)

2
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,500
Marcus Flavius Aquila.

3
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,700
Fourth cohort of Gauls,
second legion.

4
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,100
Come to relieve the command.

5
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,800
Lutorius Drusillus Salinator,
acting senior officer.

6
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,500
- Where's the garrison commander?
- He left this morning, sir.

7
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Couldn't wait to get away.

8
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,600
The duty-roster,
and the keys to the pay-chest.

9
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,600
- No paymaster?
- We're too small a garrison.

10
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,100
Unfortunately,
that job falls to you.

11
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,000
As you probably noticed,

12
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
we've had a little trouble
with the latrines,

13
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,000
but we have someone
working on it.

14
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,600
- Unsuccessfully.
- So far.

15
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,100
- This you're first command, sir?
- It is.

16
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,700
What made you choose Britain?

17
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,800
You have family connections,
I believe.

18
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,600
No.

19
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,400
I've noticed the fort,
it's in a poor state of repair.

20
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
We'll need to do something
about that.

21
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,700
Yes, sir. Sure.

22
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,200
Move, move, move.

23
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,600
Get in line, soldier!
Now! Fall in!

24
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,600
Our new commander,
Marcus Flavius Aquila.

25
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,500
Where's our
newly minted commander?

26
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,800
Probably unpacking
his rule book.

27
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,600
You mark my words.
Marcus Aquila is tainted.

28
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,000
Well, you know
who is father was.

29
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,800
The man who lost
the Eagle of the Ninth.

30
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,000
Not to mention, 5000 men.

31
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,000
That was a little absent minded.

32
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,000
I heard,
he asked to be sent here.

33
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,200
- To this shit hole?
- Yeah.

34
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,500
I'm telling you. I've marched
with the Eagles 23 years.

35
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,700
I know a bad omen,
when I see one.

36
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,100
The boy's a bad omen.

37
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,400
Mithras, lord of light.

38
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,200
Please, help me.
Father of our fathers.

39
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
Help me lead my men well.

40
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,600
Do not let me
dishonour my legion.

41
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Please, help me regain
my family's honour.

42
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,600
Dig in deep, boys.

43
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,100
Your lives depend
on these defences.

44
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,200
You must be answerable
to your instructions!

45
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,600
It's been told,
the grain delivery hasn't arrived.

46
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,000
I want you to send out a patrol
to investigate.

47
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,400
I wouldn't worry, sir. One day late,
is nothing here.

48
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,600
Well, it is to me.
Send out the patrol.

49
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Believe me sir,
too dangerous.

50
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,100
We've had reports of a Druid
roaming the villages.

51
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,800
Right now,
I would not send out a patrol.

52
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,000
The men,
they need to eat too.

53
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,000
Patrol!
Forward! March!

54
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,200
Left, right, march.

55
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,200
- Wake Lutorius.
- Yes, sir.

56
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,600
- Did you hear that?
- Sir?

57
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,000
I hope the patrol's all right.

58
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,600
It seems I may have got you up
for nothing.

59
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,900
What did you hear?

60
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,700
It's a cattle, most likely.

61
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,700
There. That.
Did you hear it?

62
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,500
Damn the dark.

63
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,400
Should I call the men to arms?

64
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,200
If it's only cattle,
they won't thank you.

65
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,100
Better angry than dead.

66
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,700
Call them out.

67
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,700
- But in silence.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,300
Soldier, wake up!

69
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,900
Bloody helmets!

70
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,200
Come on, come on!
Move, move, move!

71
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,100
Bring me a torch!

72
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,200
Hold! Steady!

73
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,900
Hold your lines!

74
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,100
- Sir.
- Well done, sir.

75
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,300
- Well done.
- Sir.

76
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,700
The light of the sun be with you,
brother.

77
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,500
Many more of us
would be lyng there, sir.

78
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,500
Is there any sign of the patrol?

79
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,200
Sir!

80
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,100
I'm not leaving them to die.

81
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,400
Muster fifty of the reserves
and hold them at the gate.

82
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,200
Sir...
Let me lead them.

83
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,500
It was my decision
to send out the patrol.

84
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,000
It's my responsibility
to bring them back.

85
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,700
Muster the men.

86
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,200
Mithras, lord of light,
father of our fathers,

87
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,900
let me not bring misfortune
to my Legion.

88
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,600
Mithras, lord of light,
father of our fathers,

89
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,700
accept whatever sacrifice,

90
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,800
that I may not
bring misfortune to my Legion.

91
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,700
On my command!

92
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,200
We form Testudo!

93
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,800
Ready!

94
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,400
Open the gate!

95
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,800
Legion!
Dopuble time, March!

96
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,300
Testudo!

97
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Form!

98
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,500
- Move forward!
- Move forward!

99
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,500
Move forward!

100
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,400
Locking Testudo!
Move!

101
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,400
Locking Testudo!
Move!

102
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Hold the circle!

103
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,800
Hold the circle!

104
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,000
- Hold the circle!
- Hold the circle!

105
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,600
Here!
Cut that's free!

106
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,700
Hold the circle!

107
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,600
Hold the circle!
Hold!

108
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,600
Hold the circle!

109
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,400
Fall back!

110
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,100
Run!

111
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,800
Run!

112
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,700
Father, where are you?

113
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Father.

114
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,800
Rest now.
Lie still, still.

115
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,200
where am I?

116
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,900
You still in Britain.
Calleva.

117
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,100
Calleva?

118
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,600
Your fort surgeon
had you transferred here.

119
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,400
Two hundred leagues
in a mule cart.

120
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,400
A few are wounded,
so I wonder you didn't die.

121
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,700
I'm your uncle,
in your father's side. Aquila.

122
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,300
These are not
the best circumstances,

123
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,500
under which to meet,
but...

124
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,300
assuming you gonna live,

125
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,100
so you'll have a plenty of time
to make your acquaintance.

126
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,800
Don't. Please, lie still.
The patient must rest.

127
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,700
I hope the medicine, he's gonna
give you does you some good.

128
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,100
It smells repellent,
like one of his farts.

129
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,300
My men?

130
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,200
What happened to my men?

131
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,300
Your men were saved.

132
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,200
Thanks to your effort.

133
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,800
Rest now.

134
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,100
{Transcribed By SALMAN}

135
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,000
Marcus.

136
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Marcus.

137
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,200
You have a visitor.

138
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,300
- Lutorius.
- Sir.

139
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,500
The men have been asking
after you.

140
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,000
And how are they?

141
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,800
Anxious to know
how their Commander fares.

142
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,600
You have some news
for my nephew?

143
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,500
Yes, sorry.

144
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,100
We have received
word from Rome.

145
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,000
For holding the fort
under extreme duress,

146
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,600
the Fourth Cohort of Gauls,

147
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,500
has been awarded
the gilded laurel.

148
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,200
From today, their standard
will carry its first wreath.

149
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Tell the men
I could not be more proud.

150
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,300
And that's not all, sir.

151
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,900
They've awarded you,
a military armilla.

152
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,200
for conspicuous gallantry.

153
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,200
And an honourable discharge,

154
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
because of your wounds.

155
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,600
The citation reads
"honour and faithfulness".

156
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,600
Honour and faithfulness.

157
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,400
May I be the first to offer
my congratulations.

158
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,700
It was good of you
to come so far.

159
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,600
Sir.

160
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,000
Thank you, Lutorius.

161
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,900
Stephanos. Leave him.

162
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,500
There's no medicine for that.

163
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Ease him down.

164
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,600
careful.

165
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,800
Gently.

166
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
Fun.

167
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,000
What was my father like?

168
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,400
Your father?

169
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,600
Your father was
the perfect Roman,

170
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,900
with everything that that implies.

171
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,600
The man who lost the Eagle
was the perfect Roman?

172
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,400
How the Eagle was lost,
no one knows.

173
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,100
But if your father died
defending it,

174
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,400
he died honourably.

175
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,000
That's what we tell ourselves.
But what if he didn't?

176
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
What?

177
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,200
What if he was a coward
and ran?

178
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,700
And now...
a fight to the death!

179
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,100
It's a slay.

180
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,100
A gladiator and a slave's
never a fair contest. Never.

181
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,800
Come on. Come on.

182
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,000
- Come on!
- Come on!

183
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,200
There's bravery.
He's gonna give himself his death.

184
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,100
Come on, fight!

185
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,100
Look at that,
look at that!

186
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,500
Fight!

187
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,100
Fight!

188
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,600
- Get up, son!
- Fight him! -- Fight!

189
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,800
- Fight steady!
- Get up!

190
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,000
- Get up and fight!
- Get up!...

191
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,900
Get up!
Fight!

192
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,000
- Come on!
- Fight!

193
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,600
Come on! Get up!

194
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,600
Kill! Kill! Kill!

195
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,300
Kill! Kill! Kill!

196
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,700
Kill! Kill! Kill!

197
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,100
Kill him!

198
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,600
Life! Life!

199
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,000
Life!
Come on, what is this?

200
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Come on,
get your thumbs up!

201
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,200
Come on, you fools! Life!
All of you, life!

202
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,000
- Kill, kill!
- Better be, it's life!

203
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,800
Get your thumbs up!
Get your thumbs up!

204
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,700
- Life!
- Come on you fools!

205
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,900
Get your thumbs up!

206
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,900
Life!

207
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,700
Life!

208
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,900
- Life!
- Life!

209
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,100
Come on!

210
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,100
No doubt
that was not expecting.

211
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,900
Why did you save him?

212
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,100
Stephanos!

213
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,600
Stephanos!

214
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I've decided Stephanos
is too old to serve two masters.

215
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
I've bought you
your own body slave.

216
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,600
I don't need my own slave.

217
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Marcus.

218
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,400
I should have been consulted.

219
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,600
Yeah, well...
you weren't.

220
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,600
Slave!

221
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,200
His name's Esca.

222
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,400
- I have no use for you.
- I had no wish to be bought.

223
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,100
You should've run.

224
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,600
My uncle wouldn't stop you.

225
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,500
You saved my life.

226
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,700
I have a debt of honour
to you.

227
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,600
Against your wish.

228
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,600
No man should have to beg
for his life.

229
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,200
You didn't. I did,
on your behalf, and...

230
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
I meant nothing by.

231
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,800
I'm the son of the Brigantes,

232
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,000
who never broke his word.

233
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,400
My father's dagger
is my bond.

234
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,800
I hate everything
you stand for.

235
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,600
Everything you are.

236
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,600
But you saved me.

237
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,500
And for that
I must serve you.

238
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,900
Who searched this wound?

239
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
The surgeon at the fort.

240
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,200
Was he drunk?
Never seen such a mess.

241
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,900
You must have been
in constant pain.

242
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,700
Sent him two hundred leagues
in a mule cart, nearly killed him.

243
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,200
I'm going to have
to re-open it.

244
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,400
There's still metal in there.

245
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Well...
I guess, it's gonna be time.

246
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,200
You're gonna do it, right?

247
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,900
- Yeah.
- It'll be over before you know it.

248
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,400
I've the best knives
in the business.

249
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,700
Some wine.

250
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,500
- Ready?
- Ready.

251
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,800
You can go.

252
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,300
No. I'm gonna need the slave
to hold you down.

253
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,900
- Can't my uncle do it?
- Me? No...

254
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,600
I've grown to hate
the sight of blood,

255
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,100
especially, the blood of someone
I'm quite fond of.

256
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,700
Be strong.

257
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,700
Quickly now.
Hold him down.

258
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,100
Put your weight on him, slave!

259
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,000
Harder!

260
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,000
Take a deep breath.

261
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,600
When I say "now",
let it out.

262
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,500
Now!

263
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,800
Did I shame myself?

264
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,100
Thank you.

265
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,400
There he is.

266
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,100
Spear! Now!

267
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,200
Cut him off!
Turn around!

268
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,400
As I remember it,
they seem to be fond of you.

269
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,400
Marcus.
May I present my nephew,

270
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,800
Marcus Flavius Aquila.

271
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,500
Claudius Marcellus
is my old friend,

272
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,200
and the esteemed Legate
of the Sixth Legion.

273
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,900
Your uncle is an old
sparring partner.

274
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Tribune Servius Placidus,
and...

275
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,000
indispensable member
of my staff.

276
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,000
pleasure.

277
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,700
Ah... Supper's ready.

278
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,700
Boiled eggs and fish.

279
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,300
Don't all rush at once.

280
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,500
If it was my choice,
I'd be a soldier all my life.

281
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,200
However, my father will insist
I go into politics.

282
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,500
Have we met before?
Your name sounds familiar.

283
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,900
Oh, I doubt it.

284
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,200
The Tribune's Club,
in Rome?

285
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,600
No, I was only
a cohort centurion.

286
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,900
Ah. Right.
I remember now.

287
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,100
Flavius Aquila...

288
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,600
Your father marched
with the Eagles, too, did he not?

289
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,600
He commanded
the First Cohort of the Ninth.

290
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,000
Of course. The Ninth.

291
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,600
Every Roman
remembers the Ninth.

292
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,400
Talking of the Ninth,

293
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,200
there's been a rumour recently
along the Wall.

294
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,900
Rumours, rumours.

295
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,800
Britain's full of nothing
but rumours.

296
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,100
They say
the Eagle's been seen,

297
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,000
receiving divine honours in some
tribal temple in the far north.

298
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,200
An Eagle in the hands of the
Painted People, a potent weapon.

299
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,900
One has to wonder
how any Roman could let it go.

300
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,100
If this were to be true,

301
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,600
surly, we should act.
What would Rome say?

302
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,800
Eagle lost, honour lost.
Honour lost, all lost.

303
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,500
Rome would love to get
the Eagle back,

304
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,800
but politics being politics,

305
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,700
no Senator's going to risk
thousands of lives,

306
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,600
on a tainted Legion.

307
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,900
My hands are tied.

308
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,500
Not if you sent one man.

309
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,500
North of the wall?

310
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,100
No Roman could survive
up there.

311
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,000
- Has anyone ever tried?
- No...

312
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,400
but that's the point, militarily.
To try, would be to fail.

313
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,000
How do you know?

314
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,600
One man can hide
where an army can't.

315
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,600
No one would even know
he was there.

316
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,800
- It's too risky.
- Quite right.

317
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
The loss of the Ninth
was humiliating enough,

318
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,300
without adding
another pointless death.

319
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,700
Marcus.

320
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,700
Marcus.

321
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,400
You can't let the likes of him
do this to you.

322
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,200
He has no notion
how you and I, lived our lives.

323
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,200
Ever since I can remember,

324
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,100
all I've ever worked to be
was a soldier. like my father.

325
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,300
I know.

326
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,400
I can still see him now,
riding away for the last time.

327
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,700
I can still feel
how proud I was.

328
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,300
My father...

329
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,500
Centurion of the First Cohort
of the Ninth Legion!

330
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,800
Can you imagine anything
more magnificent,

331
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,600
than to be a soldier?

332
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,300
And to serve Rome,
with courage and faithfulness.

333
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,100
- But you did, son.
- For what? For what?!

334
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,100
- An honourable discharge?
- That's fate.

335
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,200
That's in the hands of the Gods.

336
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,800
When I made Centurion,

337
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,200
they asked me,
where I wanted to be posted.

338
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,300
I knew the answer
before they'd even asked.

339
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,800
Britain.

340
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,800
This is where my father
lost the Eagle.

341
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,700
This is where I was going
to win so much glory,

342
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,400
that no Roman would ever dare
bring up his name again.

343
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,500
And what all I do now?

344
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,200
What all I do? I sit, and I listen to
some silk-arsed politician's son,

345
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,200
pisses on our family's name!

346
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,200
I will not sit in some villa,
for the rest of my days,

347
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,100
rotting and remembering.

348
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,900
If I can't win back
my family's honour,

349
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
by being a soldier,

350
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,000
then I'll do it by finding
the lost Eagle.

351
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,800
You can't.

352
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,200
No Roman can survive
north of the wall alone.

353
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,600
You can't.

354
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,700
Then I'll take Esca.

355
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,700
I can use his knowledge,
he speaks their language.

356
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,100
- Esca?
- Why not?

357
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,700
Because he's a Britain.

358
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,900
He may not be
from north of the wall,

359
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,300
but he's a Britain.

360
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,400
And he will slit your throat
the minute you're alone.

361
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,100
- He wouldn't do that.
- How do you know?

362
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,000
- He gave me his word.
- His word?

363
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,400
He's a slave.

364
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,700
He says what he says,
and he does what he does,

365
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,400
because he has to.

366
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,800
Once you be on their territories.

367
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,200
If I'm wrong...

368
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,600
then I'll die.

369
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,800
And that's how it should be.

370
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,900
Where are you heading?

371
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,600
North.

372
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,400
Didn't they tell you,
this is the end of the world?

373
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,500
Just open the gates, soldier.

374
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,600
See you in the afterlife, Roman.

375
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:24,600
{Transcribed By SALMAN}

376
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,600
Who did this?

377
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,600
Rogue warriors.

378
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,200
You know, sometimes, I...

379
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,500
I dream that I'll
find my father alive up here.

380
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,300
And that he survived
in some hidden place?

381
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,700
Is that why you're here?

382
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
To find your father?

383
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,100
No.

384
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,100
We're here to find the Eagle.

385
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,800
How can a piece of metal
mean so much to you?

386
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,800
The Eagle is not
a piece of metal.

387
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,600
The Eagle is Rome.

388
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,900
It's a symbol of our honour.

389
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,400
Every victory,
every achievement.

390
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,600
Wherever the Eagle is,
we can say that...

391
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,600
Rome did that.

392
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,000
You wouldn't understand.
How could you?

393
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,800
My father was Cunoval,

394
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,600
bearer of the Blue War Shield's
the Brigantes.

395
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,000
Lord of five hundred spears.

396
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,600
Seven years ago,
you took our lands.

397
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,500
And we rose against you.

398
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,200
My father
and two brothers died.

399
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,900
My mother also.

400
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,700
My father killed her before
the Legionaries broke through.

401
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,200
He knew
what they would do to her.

402
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,600
She knelt in front of him
and he slit her throat.

403
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,700
Rome also did that.

404
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,400
The Highlands.

405
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,500
- Which way?
- It's up to you.

406
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,900
Five thousand men could
disappear in a single glen.

407
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,900
There are thousands of glens.

408
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,100
You could search for months
and still find nothing.

409
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,800
North.

410
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,400
Whoever we meet,
let me do the talking.

411
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,200
If they find out
you're a Roman,

412
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,900
they'll kill you.

413
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,900
And me.

414
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,300
Don't look.

415
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,100
There's three Rogue warriors
behind you, across the river.

416
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,200
How many behind me?

417
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,000
I don't see anyone.

418
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,000
They're there.

419
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,200
Are you ready?

420
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,700
Next time,
don't hesitate.

421
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,800
Stay back.

422
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,100
He remembers seeing
the Legion march north.

423
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,900
but they never came back
this way.

424
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,500
He must know
more than that.

425
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,600
He says not.

426
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,900
- Ask him again.
- No.

427
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,800
What're you doing?

428
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Enough!
Enough!

429
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,600
No more games,
no more lies!

430
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,700
Ask him
where the legion went.

431
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,600
Ask him!

432
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,600
Kill him!

433
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,900
Kill him.

434
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,600
Do it, now!

435
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,300
Chin-strap scar.

436
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,400
Only a Roman helmet
does that.

437
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,400
He's a Legionary.

438
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,600
What do you want from me?

439
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,000
What's your name?

440
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,900
What's your name?

441
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,600
I'm called Guern.

442
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,800
My name...

443
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,700
is Lucius Caius Metellus.

444
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,400
First Cohort
of the Ninth Legion.

445
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,300
How did you survived
up here for so long?

446
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,100
My tribe is called
the Selgovae.

447
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,600
They took me in,
made me one of their own.

448
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,400
I have a woman,
two sons.

449
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,800
My life is here now.

450
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,800
I don't trust him.

451
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,600
- He's a deserter.
- We don't know that.

452
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,000
He's still a Roman.

453
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,300
He was a Roman
when he ran.

454
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:41,900
I don't know what your
father's orders were, but...

455
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,600
All I know...

456
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,700
is that we had it coming.

457
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,100
Why did they have
to come north?

458
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,900
There's nothing here
worth taking.

459
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,300
Couldn't they be satisfied
with what they had?

460
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,800
They always have to punish
and push on,

461
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:12,400
looking for more conquests,
more territories, more wars.

462
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,700
Just tell me
what happened.

463
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,700
When the order came
for the Ninth to march north,

464
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,200
it was autumn.

465
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,000
Worst weather
they had in years.

466
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:34,600
For weeks we marched,
no sign of them.

467
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,800
Suddenly, they just appeared
out of the mist.

468
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,800
We can hear them,
picking the men off at the back,

469
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,100
one by one.

470
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,600
Finally, we just stopped
trying to find open ground,

471
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,800
and we turned
and faced them.

472
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,000
Those last few days
in the Legion,

473
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,500
I've never been so frightened.

474
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,500
We fought back to back.

475
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,100
No sleep,

476
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,100
pissing where we stood.

477
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,500
They came as if like animals.

478
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,900
This is the killing ground.

479
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,600
All the northern tribes
were here.

480
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,300
But their worst,

481
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,500
were the painted warriors
of the Seal People.

482
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,600
They hacked the feet
off the dead.

483
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,000
so their souls couldn't walk
into the afterlife.

484
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:06,600
They used those stones
as Altars, to kill the officers.

485
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,700
They ripped their hearts off
while they were still alive.

486
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,900
We could hear them
being sacrificed.

487
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,200
And my father?

488
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,100
What happened to him?

489
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,200
The last time,
I saw your father,

490
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,700
he was surrounded by
the warriors of the Seal People.

491
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,900
Did he die fighting?

492
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,300
- Did he die fighting?
- I don't know.

493
00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:00,400
I ran before the end.
A lot of us did.

494
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,500
- You coward.
- No.

495
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,500
You weren't here.

496
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,400
You don't what it was like.

497
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,900
Who has the Eagle?

498
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,700
They say the Seal People
have it.

499
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,500
How do I find them?

500
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,000
He knows.

501
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,900
He's Brigantes.

502
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,700
They fought here.

503
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,400
You always knew
that place existed, didn't you?

504
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,800
We've wasted weeks
searching for it.

505
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,500
And all this time
you could have told me.

506
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,000
Your tribe was there.

507
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,100
And they butchered
my father's men like dogs.

508
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,400
Your father came to kill!

509
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,500
He came to punish us,

510
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,000
cause we were not bowed
to the name of Rome.

511
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,600
Yes, I've heard of this place.

512
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,800
To me and to all my people,

513
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,800
- it is the place of heroes.
- How dare you?

514
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,900
You're still my slave!

515
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And you'd be dead in a ditch
without me!

516
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,000
I saved your miserable life!

517
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,900
Who are you?

518
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,000
I am Esca.

519
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,400
Son of Cunoval.

520
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,200
Slain Chief of the Brigantes.

521
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,500
Who is he that you talk to
in the Roman tongue?

522
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,400
My slave.

523
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,300
My slave.

524
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,400
It's true.

525
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:35,000
Their god marks them all
with the same scar.

526
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,400
My father would like to see
such a slave.

527
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,400
You will be my guest.

528
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:51,800
You must teach your slave
not to talk to you as he does.

529
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,700
We will help you.

530
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,900
No! What's happening?

531
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,100
No!
Esca?

532
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,000
Esca?

533
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,200
Esca? Esca!

534
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:02,300
{Transcribed By SALMAN}

535
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,100
The hunting was good?

536
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,900
It was good, father.

537
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,700
You wish me to eat
these people, too?

538
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:36,700
I bring a guest, Esca.

539
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,100
Eldest son to Cunoval,

540
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,700
the slain Chief
of the Brigantes.

541
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,100
And his slave.

542
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,600
A Roman.

543
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,700
Does the slave have a name?

544
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:04,100
- Marcus Flavius Aquila.
- Marcus Flavius Aquila.

545
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,300
I have brought many Romans
back to my village,

546
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,300
Marcus Flavius Aquila.

547
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:16,000
but never with their head
attached to their body.

548
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,700
You're welcome Esca,
son of Cunoval.

549
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,000
Come. Eat with us.

550
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,100
Esca.
Esca, what's happening?

551
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,300
You're my slave.

552
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,400
Show him where to go.

553
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,200
How do you know
he’s not a spy?

554
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,600
He swore allegiance to me.

555
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:10,100
He would not dare
to disobey me.

556
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:14,900
And never to abandon me.

557
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,400
I've seen many Romans,

558
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,400
he's not savage as them.

559
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,100
You!

560
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,500
Take your eyes off her, slave!

561
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,800
What is it?

562
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:53,900
He was looking at my sister.

563
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,600
All Romans are savages.

564
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,300
I have seen what they do
to their prisoners.

565
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,200
Such people
are not to be trusted.

566
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,700
Kneel.

567
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,800
Kneel!

568
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,900
Get on your knees!

569
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,500
Do it!

570
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,500
If it pleases you...

571
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,700
kill him.

572
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,400
No.

573
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:52,100
You are my honoured guest,
and he is your property.

574
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,000
As long as you trust him,

575
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,200
he lives.

576
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,600
When I get the chance,

577
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,100
I will kill you.

578
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:26,000
Now is the time to strike.

579
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,700
Bring the great bird south,

580
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:34,300
and complete the victory of our
clan brothers fifteen years ago.

581
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,000
At the ceremony of the New Spears,
we will ask The Horned One.

582
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:41,100
If he blesses your request,
we will march south.

583
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,900
{Transcribed By SALMAN}

584
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,800
Behold, the great Eagle!

585
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,500
Marcus.

586
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,700
Marcus!
Marcus!

587
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,800
It’s time.

588
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,600
We have to do this now.

589
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,500
It’s our only chance.
while they sleep.

590
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:39,000
I thought I’d lost you.

591
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,000
Quickly.

592
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:30,100
There’s no time now.
Let’s go.

593
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:36,800
We have to go now!

594
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,800
Where did you get
my father’s ring?

595
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:35,700
Just another dead Roman.

596
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:42,400
The coward knelt before me
and begged for his life.

597
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:51,600
What did he say?

598
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,200
We have to go.

599
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,400
Esca?

600
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,800
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

601
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,200
Can I go with you?

602
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,700
Go back to your family.

603
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,600
My father will be angry.

604
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,200
You tell him,

605
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:40,300
when he wakes,

606
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:44,700
Esca’s sorry
but he has to go now.

607
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,800
Not until he wakes.
You understand?

608
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,600
Esca?

609
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,300
If he wakes them, we’re dead.
And you know it.

610
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,600
He has no reason
to protect us.

611
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,500
Do you trust me?

612
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,000
He won’t betray us.

613
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,900
They’ve gone?

614
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,800
They’ve gone!

615
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:01,700
Hya!

616
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,600
Come on, come on!

617
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:28,800
- How many days to the wall?
- If we ride hard, four, maybe five.

618
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,000
They’ll never catch us on foot.

619
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,400
- Have you seen them run?
- Come on, come on.

620
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:02,200
You’re wounded.
Why didn’t you say?

621
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,500
- It's nothing.
- It's your bad leg. Sit down.

622
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,300
- We don't have time.
- Just sit down.

623
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:22,300
In the cave... the chief.
What did he say?

624
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,900
Come on,
there's no time right now.

625
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,900
They’re coming.

626
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,500
Half a day behind.
The wind always lies.

627
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:04,600
{Transcribed By SALMAN}

628
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:42,300
No fires.
It's too risky.

629
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:54,400
I’m not eating that.
I’m not a savage.

630
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,400
Then die a Roman.

631
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,800
You've lost a lot of blood.

632
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,400
You need to keep
your strength up.

633
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:09,900
Eat.

634
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,400
It's time to go.

635
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,600
They can take shortcuts
that the horses can't.

636
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:08,800
Come on, keep going.
Come on!

637
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,000
Come on!

638
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:15,600
No!

639
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,600
We need to stick to the river.
They'll double back soon enough.

640
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:12,300
{Transcribed By SALMAN}

641
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,100
- Rest.
- We can't.

642
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,400
You need to rest!

643
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:18,800
Marcus!

644
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,900
You need to rest.

645
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,100
Come on.

646
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,900
Come on.

647
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,200
I can’t go on.

648
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:51,000
Yes, you can.
You just need to rest.

649
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:57,200
Take the Eagle.
If you find horses come back.

650
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,700
If not,
just keep south!

651
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,800
Make sure,
this gets back to Rome.

652
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:07,100
I’m not leaving you here.

653
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:10,200
Do not dishonour me.
Take it.

654
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,700
I came this far with you,

655
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,700
I won't leave you now.

656
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:20,300
Esca, I order you.

657
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,800
Take it.

658
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:26,200
I swore an oath of honour,

659
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,000
never to abandon you!

660
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:33,700
If you want me to leave,

661
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,100
set me free.

662
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,400
Give me my freedom.

663
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,200
You’re free.

664
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,400
You’re free my friend.

665
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,100
- Take it.
- No.

666
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:21,500
I will return.

01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,300
Your father’s Legionaries.

670
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,600
You were wrong.

The dead can live.

672
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:16,600
My shame would not allow me
to tell you this before,

673
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:19,100
but I watched your father die.

674
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:24,700
Whatever anyone tells you,
he was not a coward.

675
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:29,200
He stood his ground,
to the very end.

676
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,300
I saw it.

677
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:36,800
The last Roman to hold the Eagle
was your father.

678
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:41,900
The order, sir.

679
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:47,000
You’ve honoured
my father’s memory enough.

680
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:49,700
- You don’t have to do this.
- No.

681
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,900
When I ran from your father,

682
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,200
I ran from myself.

683
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:05,400
Give the order, sir.

684
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,900
Prepare to defend the Eagle!

To those who would betray
their own kind,

I'll show you
how to deal with them.

Out swords!

who fought and die,

in the name of honour.

691
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:16,600
Romans and Britains.

692
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,200
My father and yours.

693
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:35,600

May peace and honour
follow you.

697

May you know no more strife.

May your souls
take flight and soar.

699

700
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,900

My dear boy!

I congratulate you,
Rome congratulate you.

Your family's
good name is restored.

704
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:52,700
The senate will want
to reform the Ninth,

705
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,400
perhaps they can reward you
with its command.

706
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:01,400
I don't know
how did you do it.

707
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:05,000
- With only a slave to help you.
- He's not a slave.

708
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:10,100
And he knows more about honour
and freedom, than you ever will.

709
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,400
So, what now?
