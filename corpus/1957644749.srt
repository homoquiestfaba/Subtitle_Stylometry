00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:01,034
(silence)

00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,266
THEME SONG: Hi dum deedle dee hi dum dee dum.

3
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,435
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum dee dum.

4
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,437
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum.

5
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,773
Hi deedlee deedlee dee.

6
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,409
As the first bright glimmers of sunshine bravely peek from

7
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:46,012
the horizon, there's an orchestration of creatures

8
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,381
that I always find surprising.

9
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:52,385
With the animals in unison, each cow and duck and bird,

10
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,889
there is music unlike anything you've heard.

11
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,390
[animal noises]

12
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,460
It's another typical morning in the meadow we abide in.

13
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:04,597
And the bees are busy a buzzing off to where the

14
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,799
honey's hiding.

15
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,568
And the birdies all are chirping with the crickets

16
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:09,669
every place.

17
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:12,906
And the soggy froggy chorus sings the bass.

18
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,307
[frog noises]

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,342
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum dee dum.

20
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,812
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum dee dum.

21
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,480
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum.

22
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,415
Hi deedlee deedlee dee.

23
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,318
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum dee dum.

24
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,253
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum dee dum.

25
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,822
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum.

26
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,157
Hi deedlee deedlee dee.

27
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,860
There is nothing nice as our field mice.

28
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,328
They practice many hours.

29
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,231
And they fill the air with a big fanfare on

30
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,833
fiddles made of flowers.

31
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:44,404
And the magic of the meadow is the music in the air.

32
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,607
Why, you never heard a symphony so rare.

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,008
[clucking]

34
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,110
Every day begins with an overture,

35
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,079
a serenade of pleasure.

36
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:56,583
In the big tree trunks are a few chipmunks that warble

37
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,851
every measure.

38
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:01,654
Every billy goat and nanny croon a tune as sweet as pies

39
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,190
while 100 humming birdies harmonize.

40
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,125
Hum, hum, hum, hum.

41
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,161
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum dee dum.

42
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,263
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum dee dum.

43
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,031
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum.

44
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,400
Hi deedlee deedlee dee.

45
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:17,003
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum dee dum.

46
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,339
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum dee dum.

47
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,707
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum.

48
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,277
Hi deedlee deedlee deedlee deedlee deedlee deedlee

49
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,245
deedlee dee.

50
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:29,182
Hi deedlee deedlee dee.

51
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,050
OAKLEY (VOICEOVER): A long, long time

52
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,619
ago, there was a meadow.

53
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,922
Now, this great meadow and the flower fairies and creatures

54
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:39,692
living in it were rules over by the tiny little princess,

55
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,027
Thumbelina.

56
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,663
There was supposed to be a meadow prince too, but he had

57
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:47,600
been kidnapped as a tiny baby, and his fate remained a

58
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,635
mystery.

59
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,904
-The meadow meeting is now in session.

60
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:51,604
[laughter]

61
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,473
Excuse me.

62
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,241
Hello.

63
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,643
(YELLING) Quiet!

64
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,313
That's better.

65
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,282
All yours, Princess Thumbelina.

66
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,188
-The first order of business will be issuing new work

67
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,589
assignments.

68
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,494
Snapdragon, you've got to spruce up your flowers.

69
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,195
They look like they've been through a flood.

70
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,130
-I'll snap to it, Princess Thumbelina.

71
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,264
Right away.

72
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,032
OAKLEY (VOICEOVER): Where was I?

73
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,500
Oh, oh, right.

74
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,369
Although much loved by her loyal subjects, Thumbelina had

75
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,539
her hands full trying to keep things running smoothly.

76
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,676
After all, it was really a two person job.

77
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,612
-Now I'd like to open the meeting to new business.

78
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:36,482
[buzzing]

79
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:40,486
-The buzz around the hive is that a certain food addicted

80
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,356
frog's been eating my drones again.

81
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,558
-Now, just hold your hornets, Queenie.

82
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,660
I'm not interested in your stinging drones.

83
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,630
Do I look like I want my tongue pierced?

84
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,232
[burps]

85
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,969
-I told you, you should stick to flies, Bud.

86
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,171
-I couldn't help it, Slocum.

87
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,573
Ah, how sweet it is.

88
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,477
Uh oh.

89
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,913
Here comes trouble.

90
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,916
-Oh, like, wow, that trip really blew my mind.

91
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,551
-We're going already.

92
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,821
Hey, Thumbelina, call off your bird, would ya?

93
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:18,725
-Daffodil, Bluebell, Impatiens, you fairies are in

94
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,692
big trouble.

95
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,494
Bluebell, you forgot to deposit your

96
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,862
dewdrops this morning.

97
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,931
Daffodil, you didn't feed the hummingbirds.

98
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:28,234
And Impatiens, you forgot to turn the fireflies on for the

99
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,636
third night in a row.

100
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,005
Now, what have you got to say for yourselves?

101
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,439
-Oops.

102
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,042
-My nuts, my nuts, oh, where are my nuts?

103
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,443
All my nuts, somebody stole my nuts.

104
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,345
They're gone, all my winter acorns.

105
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,314
-Hey, don't be a mental case, Nutley.

106
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,916
You probably just forgot where you buried them.

107
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,318
-Nope, don't think so.

108
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,853
I got records.

109
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,322
Oh, records, records, oh, oh, where'd I put my records?

110
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:49,922
Here they are.

111
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,324
See?

112
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,659
It's those three.

113
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:53,593
I saw them.

114
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,327
I saw them digging around my tree.

115
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,228
Where's my nuts?

116
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,629
Where are they?

117
00:04:56,663 --> 00:05:00,900
-Uh, but you said we were digging for treasure.

118
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,301
-That's nothing.

119
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,570
Someone's been painting graffiti on Slocum's shell.

120
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,004
-Where?

121
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,005
Where?

122
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,473
I hate it when that happens.

123
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,375
-What makes you so sure it was fairies?

124
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,313
-Jeez, blue paint.

125
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,749
I wonder who did that, Bluebell.

126
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:17,950
-You got no proof.

127
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,189
-Oh, how'd that get there?

128
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,657
[nervous laugh]

129
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,758
-You gotta do something about these three, Thumbelina.

130
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,126
They're out of control.

131
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,430
-Well, at least we don't bury our food in the dirt or eat

132
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:34,600
drones like some other low life middle creatures I know.

133
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,268
-Low life?

134
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,036
Why I oughta--

135
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,372
to the moon, fairies, to the moon.

136
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,240
-Ah, we're scared.

137
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,609
Look, my wings are shaking.

138
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:44,677
Not.

139
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,813
-Hey, guys, we're trying for harmony here.

140
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,216
[arguing]

141
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,684
-Oh, I hate Mondays.

142
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,055
[sigh]

143
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,557
I'd better go see Oakley.

144
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,258
Maybe he can give me some pointers on how

145
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,660
to handle this crowd.

146
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:14,907
-Hey, Thumbelina.

147
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,142
-Nice of you to drop by.

148
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,477
-You know, you could visit more often.

149
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,748
-I've got a nice sapling I'd like you to meet.

150
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,349
-Hello, princess.

151
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,752
He was up all night playing cards.

152
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:26,753
-Oakley?

153
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,954
Oakley?

154
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,059
-Wh-- what are you waking me--

155
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:37,096
oh, it's my little friend, Thumbelina.

156
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,166
Thumbelina, why the face?

157
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,567
-[sigh]

158
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,237
Oh, Oakley, I don't know.

159
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,340
I guess I'm feeling a little overwhelmed.

160
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,875
-Well, that's only natural.

161
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,645
I remember when you were just a baby and the queen fairy

162
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,714
first brought you to the meadow.

163
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,984
-Here he goes again with the story.

164
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,953
-Don't needle me, you big sap.

165
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:01,721
Where was I?

166
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,922
Oh, yeah.

167
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,761
-Wow.

168
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,096
-What?

169
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,799
You've never seen a magic reflecting tree stump before?

170
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,067
-Each of these children is from the very

171
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,669
best of royal families.

172
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,872
Together, they will rule as prince and princess of the

173
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,407
great meadow.

174
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,709
When they are of age, we hope they may fall in love and

175
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,647
marry, bringing happiness to us and them.

176
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,449
see This is a symbol of your royal birth.

177
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:34,287
Only together will your kingdom be complete.

178
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,923
-But then came that terrible, terrible day.

179
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,095
[cawing]

180
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,865
-You've got a big job, princess, and a

181
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,166
very important one.

182
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,634
But don't despair.

183
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,404
Someday, you'll find your prince, and the two of you

184
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,573
will rule happily ever after.

185
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,209
I'd stake my acorns on it.

186
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,243
-I know.

187
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,845
I will find him someday.

188
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,853
-[yelling]

189
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:07,854
[laughing]

190
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,255
You'll never catch me, Duke.

191
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:13,226
[barking]

192
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,627
Yeehaw!

193
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,216
-[laughs]

194
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,619
Bravo, Tom.

195
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,286
Bravo.

196
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,821
-Nice entrance, Tom.

197
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,222
-I've taken the liberty of drawing up some plans for the

198
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,358
castle expansion project.

199
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,894
-Medwin, you know my feelings about

200
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,061
building a bigger castle.

201
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,364
This one suits me fine.

202
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,667
Besides, these plans call for leveling the great meadow.

203
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,803
That meadow is as valuable to me as a dozen castles.

204
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:01,073
When will you learn to have some regard for nature?

205
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,442
-Oh, Forget nature, father.

206
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,044
Bigger is better.

207
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,812
This place is outdated.

208
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,849
We need to get with the times, install an indoor swimming

209
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,418
hole, a 12 carriage garage.

210
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:16,622
-I refuse to use my subjects' taxes on such frivolities.

211
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,058
-Then we'll use their muscle.

212
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,960
Look what a fine job the slaves in

213
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,696
Egypt did on the pyramids.

214
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,931
-Maybe we can--

215
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,000
-I will not enslave my loyal subjects to build a-- a

216
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,569
joust-o-rama.

217
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,870
-Fine.

218
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,838
Greenville will stay in the dark while everybody else

219
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,607
moves into the middle ages.

220
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,841
[sigh]

221
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,376
We might as well just stick our head in the sand.

222
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,978
-I-- if you'd--

223
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,614
-That meadow and the creatures in it are just as important as

224
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,717
the peasants, knights, king, or king's son.

225
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,086
We will not forsake them for a--

226
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,121
uh, IHOG?

227
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,223
-International House of Gruel.

228
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,159
Oh, very well, Father.

229
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,861
After all, you're the king--

230
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,229
(MUTTERS) for now.

231
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,533
But I think you'll regret your decision soon.

232
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,033
-[caws]

233
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,201
Regret it.

234
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,035
-I--

235
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,036
I've got an idea.

236
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,905
-That boy is so headstrong.

237
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,206
-Good idea, Tom.

238
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,041
I think you may have something there, Tom.

239
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,009
[sigh]

240
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:10,810
It's not easy being small.

241
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,859
-Mm, I smell chocolate pudding.

242
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:30,029
-But I was just getting a few crumbs for the little ones.

243
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,130
I wasn't doing no harm.

244
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,598
Have pity, sir.

245
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,833
-[caws]

246
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,201
Oh, all right.

247
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,202
I'll be merciful.

248
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,670
[cackles]

249
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,606
I'll eat you in one bite rather than tearing you into

250
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,807
little pieces.

251
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,716
Why, if it isn't a pudding pop version of Tom Thumb.

252
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,386
I should have eaten you when I had the chance.

253
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,888
Too bad the king got to you first.

254
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,891
This mouse won't be so lucky.

255
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,159
-Leave her alone, Edgar.

256
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,961
-Pest, get that away from me.

257
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,698
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's not polite to point?

258
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,867
[caws]

259
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,104
Nevermore, Tom Thumb, nevermore will you be safe in

260
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,439
this palace.

261
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,374
-Thank you, Master Tom.

262
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,910
Once again, you've saved my life.

263
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,979
-Any time, Fiona.

264
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,313
Tell that to King Richard.

265
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,982
Thinks it's too dangerous.

266
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,053
-Well, the king loves you very much, ever since he rescued

267
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,788
you when you was just a wee lad.

268
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,056
-I know he means well.

269
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,591
I just wish I could defend his honor against his Saxon

270
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,093
enemies like the rest of the knights.

271
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,863
-Well now, King Richard just hasn't seen how good you are

272
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,465
with a fork.

273
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,902
-I may be small, Fiona, but I know I'm meant for big things.

274
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,336
-Ah, get out of here.

275
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,673
You dirty bird, get out of my kitchen.

276
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:52,044
[cawing]

277
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,081
-La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la--

278
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,482
what is that?

279
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:02,254
Ah, Tom Thumb, what are you doing in there?

280
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,389
-Oh, hi, Cookie.

281
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,324
Just testing the batter.

282
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:08,060
Mm, delicious as usual.

283
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:08,894
-[laughs]

284
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,563
You sweet talker.

285
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,263
-[laughs]

286
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,698
Come on, Fiona.

287
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,667
We'd better make tracks before Edgar makes a return

288
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,968
engagement.

289
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,369
Yeehaw!

290
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,278
-You're looking especially fiendish today.

291
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,981
Hello, Blackthorn.

292
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,483
-Why, thank you.

293
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,953
Coming from the lad who put the evil in medieval, I'll

294
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,788
take that as a compliment.

295
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,023
[laughs]

296
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,259
-I wish you'd take a bath instead.

297
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,161
-Do you have the money?

298
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,429
-Right here.

299
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,231
Half now and half when we deliver King

300
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,699
Richard to the Saxons.

301
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,968
They've had it out for him since he beat the pants off

302
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,469
them in the War of the Roses.

303
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,972
-Dear, dear, dear, just like my father to fight over a

304
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,307
bunch of flowers.

305
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,676
Let me have it.

306
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,647
-Give me the information first.

307
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,948
-Oh, all right.

308
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,618
The king will be taking his annual spring ride to Fern

309
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,921
Glen tomorrow morning at 10 with no guard.

310
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,458
It's when he communes with his precious nature, blah, blah,

311
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,826
blah, what a snore.

312
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,395
You'll be able to grab him on the glen path.

313
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:20,933
He'll be helpless, trapped, and put out of commission.

314
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,470
[laughter]

315
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:28,407
-Oh, you are truly rotten, selling your own father to his

316
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,510
enemies so that you can become the king.

317
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,013
You're like the son I never had.

318
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:34,947
-Oh, stop.

319
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,482
Soon, I'll be the king.

320
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,585
And you will be the captain of my army of black knights.

321
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:42,621
Money, power, and the kingdom--

322
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,456
oh, soon, I'll--

323
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,859
-We'll have it all.

324
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:50,596
[laughter]

325
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,232
-And that's a Winter Aspen.

326
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,967
What do you think, Tom?

327
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,535
Isn't it beautiful?

328
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,470
-Oh, it's wonderful, your highness.

329
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,105
Thank you for bringing me along.

330
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,208
-Who is that?

331
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,777
-Oh, and there's a Bare-breasted Nuthatch.

332
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,379
Oh, unusual to spot one around these parts.

333
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,955
-H--

334
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,957
hello.

335
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,725
-Hello.

336
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:20,426
-Who are you?

337
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,794
Do you live up there?

338
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,362
[rumbling]

339
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,534
King Richard!

340
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:32,738
-Wait.

341
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,073
Go back.

342
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,608
-I don't think we'd better, princess.

343
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,576
You mustn't be put in any danger.

344
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,312
Remember your duty to your subjects.

345
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,313
-Giddyup, Stormy.

346
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:42,882
Back to the castle.

347
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,283
Come on, Duke.

348
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,123
Sound the alarm!

349
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,491
Sound the alarm!

350
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,059
The king's been kidnapped!

351
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,032
-Oh, I would really like to join you, but someone's got to

352
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,934
stay here and look after the castle.

353
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:06,071
Besides, I'm wearing white, and it soils so easily.

354
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,041
-Oh, yeah, you're so pure.

355
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,242
Just noticing.

356
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,176
-Giddyup, Stormy.

357
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,711
Let's go!

358
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,979
-Whoa, girl.

359
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,381
-I've got to come with you.

360
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,049
I want to help find King Richard.

361
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,517
-Sorry, Tom.

362
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,719
I'm afraid this trip would be too dangerous for you.

363
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,589
Besides, the king would want someone he could trust to stay

364
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:26,058
here and keep and eye on Medwin.

365
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,626
-[sigh]

366
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,827
Very well.

367
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,899
-Good luck.

368
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,100
Godspeed.

369
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,769
Now we can finally get things done the

370
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,671
right way around here.

371
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,039
-You mean our way.

372
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:44,343
[laughter]

373
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,912
-Medwin doesn't seem too broken up about his father

374
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,314
being kidnapped.

375
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:55,120
-Oh, this place is so 12th century.

376
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,089
It's time we got with the times.

377
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,357
Drab, drab, drab.

378
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,894
Everything must go.

379
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,397
-But King Richard never made us pay taxes like this.

380
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,434
-I have big plans for this kingdom, so

381
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,669
work with me people--

382
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,339
at least until I can make you my slaves.

383
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,447
-Hey, Bud, maybe you should try for something slower, like

384
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,915
snails or ants or something.

385
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,049
-Are you kidding me?

386
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,384
That's for old frogs.

387
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,287
I just need to get my tongue adjusted.

388
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,956
Hey, watch where you're putting those clodhoppers.

389
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:32,291
-Here.

390
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:36,528
Marvin, I want the new throne room right here.

391
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,496
-Uh oh.

392
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,198
Timber!

393
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:39,832
-Wha--

394
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,867
oh!

395
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,069
What's the idea tripping me?

396
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:44,970
-It--

397
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:46,105
it was just an accident.

398
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,307
-Oh, of course it was.

399
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,711
Hm, I'll bet you'd make some tasty turtle soup.

400
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:56,048
-Hey, what's the idea picking on a defenseless turtle?

401
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,349
-How would you like to be my next

402
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,351
science experiment, froggy?

403
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,287
-Oh, uh, uh, no offense, good sir.

404
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,722
We're just not used to strangers

405
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,457
in our little meadow.

406
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,259
-Well, you'd better get used to it.

407
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,695
This is where my new castle's going up.

408
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,865
Oh, it will be glorious, a tribute to my

409
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,400
power and good taste.

410
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,436
And there will be floor to ceiling tapestries woven with

411
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:21,106
my likeness, a sculpture garden with statues of, well,

412
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,042
me, and a special art gallery with--

413
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,278
-Let me guess, paintings of you?

414
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,880
-Fabulous idea.

415
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,182
-Hey, Bud, we gotta get away from this guy.

416
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,183
Gulp.

417
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,651
-I hear you, Slocum.

418
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:36,922
-Ahem, that's very nice, sire, and such a lovely view.

419
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,324
Why don't you tell us a little more about it?

420
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,893
-Oh, yes, yes, yes.

421
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:44,696
Over there will be the main castle, my castle, surrounded

422
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,400
by a 20-foot wide, alligator filled moat.

423
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,035
Or should I use crocodiles?

424
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,503
Oh, well, whatever.

425
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,106
Over here, we'll have a reflecting pool that I will be

426
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,108
able to gaze into.

427
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,076
-Yikes.

428
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,044
-What's happening?

429
00:17:59,078 --> 00:17:59,978
Is it an earthquake?

430
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:00,846
-Cave in!

431
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:01,780
Run for your lives!

432
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,419
-We'd better report this to Thumbelina right away.

433
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,455
-I'm very concerned about you three.

434
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,224
You've got to start taking your work seriously, or I

435
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,627
won't have any choice but to take your wings.

436
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:19,064
-Uh, but the work is so-- so boring.

437
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,701
Polish the leaves, clean the cobwebs, open the flowers,

438
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,671
close the flowers, carry the dew over here, carry the dew

439
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,005
over there.

440
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,008
Oh, I feel like a-- an ant.

441
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,410
-We want some fun.

442
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,178
-Yeah, we want some excitement.

443
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,047
-We want some action.

444
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,082
-Princess Thumbelina, quick!

445
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,051
You gotta come!

446
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,321
-Hey, watch where you're going, bug eyes.

447
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,288
-What is it?

448
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,256
Bud, slow down.

449
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,225
Slocum, what's going on?

450
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,759
-I-- invaders.

451
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,128
Humans in the meadow.

452
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,596
They're tearing it apart.

453
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,165
-We've lost half our tunnels to cave ins.

454
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,333
-Our stream's been dammed.

455
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,968
The pond looks like it's a goner.

456
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,237
-And I was almost [gulp]

457
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,238
dissected.

458
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,573
-Who could these people be?

459
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,742
The humans have never bothered us before.

460
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,011
-Sounds like another case of big people

461
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,546
picking on little people.

462
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,748
-Why can't we all just get along?

463
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,584
-Well, I'm moving to another meadow.

464
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,521
-There's only one way to find out what's going on.

465
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,156
I'll have to go to the castle and take

466
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,724
this up with the king.

467
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:22,427
[sounds of dissent]

468
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,097
It's the only way to nip this crisis in the bud.

469
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,398
-Huh?

470
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,467
-Take me to the Castle Greenville, Flicker.

471
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,305
-Well, it was nice knowing her.

472
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,879
-Uh, excuse me, sirs.

473
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:41,747
Hello.

474
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,514
-Well, look at you.

475
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,283
Hey, Mo, get a load of this.

476
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,151
-What have we got here, a shrinky dink?

477
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,953
-I'm here on business.

478
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,521
I need to see the king.

479
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,756
-[laughs]

480
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:51,423
Who doesn't?

481
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,158
-It's an emergency.

482
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:54,159
-Yeah right.

483
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,561
That's what they all say.

484
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,297
-But the great meadow is being destroyed.

485
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,065
I have to tell the king what's happening.

486
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,000
Only he can stop it.

487
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:02,868
-Meadow shmeadow.

488
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:03,835
Orders from the top.

489
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,603
No one gets in.

490
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,138
So scream.

491
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,406
-Hm.

492
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:11,043
Who says we have to go in the front door?

493
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,412
Down there, Flicker.

494
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,981
-These flies are really bugging me.

495
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,482
Why don't they just stay put?

496
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,184
[caws]

497
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:21,053
-All right, where's the king?

498
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,021
-You're looking at him.

499
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,389
-You're not King Richard.

500
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,425
-Oh, very perceptive.

501
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,861
Unfortunately, King Richard's been [sigh]

502
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,029
kidnapped.

503
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,198
I'm his son Medwin, the new king.

504
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,134
You may call me your majesty.

505
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,103
-King Richard's been kidnapped?

506
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,638
Oh, no.

507
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,975
Well, someone is tearing up the great meadow, and you must

508
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,344
put a stop to it.

509
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,144
-What are you?

510
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,679
Some kind of bug?

511
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:51,116
-I'm Princess Thumbelina, and I rule the great meadow.

512
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,485
-Oh, I don't think so, princess.

513
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:57,589
I rule everything around here, including the great meadow,

514
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,858
which is soon to be the home of my new,

515
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,560
improved castle complex.

516
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,763
In fact, you're standing on the plans.

517
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,331
-But this is huge.

518
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,966
What about all the creatures that need

519
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,534
the meadow to survive?

520
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,838
And if you destroy the meadow, the forest could be next and

521
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,006
then the river and--

522
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,307
-Oh, cry me a river.

523
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,843
Do I look like I care?

524
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,544
-Apparently, you don't.

525
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:22,314
-Look, I'm not completely heartless.

526
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,416
Construction doesn't begin for a week.

527
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:28,153
We'll be happy to relocate you.

528
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:31,123
How do you feel about the swamp?

529
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,191
-You have to stop the destruction.

530
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,259
-La, la, la, la, la, la.

531
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,827
I'm not hearing you.

532
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,864
You'd better get out there before I set Edgar on you.

533
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,232
Blah, la, la, la, la.

534
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,567
-Let me at them, boss.

535
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,736
-You won't get away with this, Medwin.

536
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,704
-King Medwin.

537
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:46,872
[laughs]

538
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,907
-I have to find out what Medwin's up to and

539
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,008
put a stop to it.

540
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,410
[shout]

541
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,048
-Hey, where'd you learn to fly?

542
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,349
I beg your pardon?

543
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,951
I think you're the one who needs lessons.

544
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,320
[sigh]

545
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,356
It seems that everyone in this castle is rude.

546
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,925
-It's you, from the forest.

547
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:07,826
Hey, wait a minute.

548
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,394
Rude?

549
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,929
I'm rude because you weren't watching where you were going?

550
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:12,264
-Come on, Flicker.

551
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,765
I've had enough of this place.

552
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,733
-No, wait, wait.

553
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:15,934
I'm sorry.

554
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,135
I didn't mean to be rude.

555
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:17,736
I just--

556
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,170
I--

557
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,137
I mean--

558
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,172
who are you?

559
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,773
-I'm Thumbelina.

560
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,141
Who are you?

561
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,576
You're not a fairy.

562
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,877
-Uh, no.

563
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:26,511
I--

564
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,479
I'm not.

565
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,247
At-- at least I don't think I am.

566
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,549
I'm Tom Thumb.

567
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,250
I live here at the castle.

568
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,618
Do you live in the forest?

569
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:34,419
-No.

570
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:35,887
I live in the great meadow.

571
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,123
And if we don't get back there soon, there won't be any

572
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,759
meadow left.

573
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:41,793
-What do you Mean

574
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,395
-As if you didn't know.

575
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,498
I'd think castle was plenty big enough for you people and

576
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,467
that you wouldn't have to come barging in and

577
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,802
destroying our meadow.

578
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:51,803
-Wait!

579
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,538
I don't know what you're talking about.

580
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:54,873
Great.

581
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,441
I meet the most beautiful girl in the world, and she's my

582
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,677
size, and she thinks I'm a creep.

583
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,284
-I won't wait any longer, Marvin.

584
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,020
We start construction tomorrow morning.

585
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,822
Oh, just look at it--

586
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,224
Medwinville.

587
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:16,728
From now on, time will be recorded as BM or AM--

588
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:21,600
before Medwinville and after Medwinville.

589
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,069
-Quite a piece of real estate, your landlordliness.

590
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,611
-(SINGING) Construction, it starts with destruction.

591
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:36,548
You do demolition with no intermission.

592
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:42,320
It may be a bummer, but not for a plumber, a building

593
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:46,691
technician, or an electrician.

594
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:51,363
-(SINGING) I want a castle that's good enough for me I

595
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:55,433
want to live like the king I'm gonna be.

596
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:59,838
What is all the meadow should be gone without a trace.

597
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:04,476
It's not important, 'cause I've got to have my space.

598
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,914
Bring on the shovels, the dozers, and the light.

599
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,816
I need construction.

600
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,251
I need it day and night.

601
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,422
I don't even care if any people think I'm mean.

602
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:22,060
Build me a palace like nobody's ever seen.

603
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,028
-(SINGING) Build it.

604
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:23,995
Build it.

605
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,331
Dig it all up and filled it.

606
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:30,602
After I chilled it, we're gonna build it.

607
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,469
Take it.

608
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,671
Take it.

609
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:35,240
Knock it all down and break it.

610
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:39,177
After I quake and shake it, I'm gonna take it.

611
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,746
-(SINGING) Got to have my castle.

612
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,149
I've got to have it bad.

613
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,552
No one better spoil my super royal pad.

614
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:52,324
If I can't have my castle, I'll be sad and unfulfilled.

615
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,593
Recess is over, boys.

616
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:57,229
We've got a monument to build.

617
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,164
Tear down the meadow.

618
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,433
It's only in my way.

619
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,702
It's not my problem.

620
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,871
Just let it go away.

621
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:10,508
I need my expansion, and I want it very much.

622
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:14,746
Forget the meadow and ecology and such.

623
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,014
I'll get respect.

624
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:23,688
I'll get gold because my palace is stunning to behold.

625
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:28,727
When they see my castle, ever mister and madame knows from

626
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,297
my castle just how great a king I am.

627
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,865
-(SINGING) Build it.

628
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:34,866
Build it.

629
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,635
Dig it all up and filled it.

630
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:41,239
After I chilled it, I'm gonna build it.

631
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,140
Take it.

632
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,275
Take it.

633
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,477
Knock it all down and break it.

634
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,814
After I quake it, I'm gonna take it.

635
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:53,451
Construction, it starts with destruction.

636
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:57,856
You do demolition with no intermission.

637
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:03,061
It may be a bummer, but not for a plumber, a building

638
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:06,564
technician, or an electrician.

639
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:11,937
It may be a bummer, but not for a plumber, a building

640
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,740
technician, or an electrician.

641
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,209
-(SINGING) I've got to have my castle.

642
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,478
-(SINGING) He's got to have his castle.

643
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:25,750
He's got to have his castle now.

644
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:33,491
-Oakley?

645
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:34,459
Oakley?

646
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,928
-[yawns]

647
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:42,067
Thumbelina, twice in one week, you come to visit me.

648
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,035
-Oakley, there's trouble in the meadow.

649
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,070
-Trouble?

650
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,338
Let me tell you about trouble.

651
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,173
My roots are aching, I got birds pecking

652
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,708
at me, and the squirrels.

653
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:53,578
Don't even get me started on the squirrels.

654
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,279
What?

655
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,914
What is it?

656
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:56,915
Tell me the trouble.

657
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,316
-The meadow is in danger.

658
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,919
I'm afraid it's going to be destroyed by the humans.

659
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:04,823
-Oh, I'm afraid that's always a danger, Thumbelina.

660
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:08,793
You just have to do your best to keep everyone safe.

661
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,829
-But I feel so helpless.

662
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,531
Flicker, post all the birds as sentries.

663
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,800
I'll send the flower fairies out to guard the perimeters.

664
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,703
I want plenty of warning before they come.

665
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,338
Maybe that'll give us enough time to think of

666
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,173
a way to stop them.

667
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,142
-Hey, just hold on there.

668
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,678
Where do you think you're going.

669
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:27,645
-Wow.

670
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,446
What are you?

671
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,348
Are those wings on your back?

672
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,418
-Oh, we got a real rocket scientist here.

673
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,754
-You must be fairies.

674
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,690
I've never seen one up close and personal.

675
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:39,224
-All right.

676
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,558
That's cool.

677
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,228
-Are you always this suspicious of strangers?

678
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,163
-So you admit you're a stranger.

679
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,399
-Enough talk, intruders.

680
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,434
Let's take him to Princess Thumbelina.

681
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,636
She'll know what to do with him.

682
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,004
-Thumbelina.

683
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,305
Y-- yeah.

684
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,309
Yeah, you better take us to this Thumbelina.

685
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,345
-I see you're spying on us now.

686
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,113
-Ha, I knew it.

687
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,448
-I'm not a spy.

688
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:04,749
-Then what are you doing here?

689
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,684
-I've come to warn you about Medwin.

690
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,453
He's starting his castle tomorrow.

691
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,755
He's going to pave the meadow and-- and put up a carriage

692
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,491
house and an-- an IHOG, whatever that is.

693
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,060
-So why do you want to help?

694
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,095
Aren't you putting yourself in danger?

695
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,330
-I serve King Richard, not Medwin.

696
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,733
King Richard isn't here to stop the destruction, so I'm

697
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:24,102
taking matters into my own hands.

698
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,537
-Do you know how to stop Medwin?

699
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,906
-I know where Medwin's equipment is being kept.

700
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,375
All I need are a few good fairies that will throw a

701
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:33,311
wrench into the works until King Richard returns.

702
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:34,212
-All right.

703
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,780
You heard him.

704
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:39,951
We need to able-bodied fairies to, uh, throw some wrenches.

705
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,453
-Well, something like that.

706
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,188
-Bu the humans are so big.

707
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,656
We wouldn't stand a chance.

708
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,025
-Uh, if vandalism is involved, we'd like to volunteer.

709
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,060
-We're perfect for the job.

710
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:49,894
-Choose us.

711
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,496
Choose us.

712
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,131
-OK, but I'm going too.

713
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,900
This is a dangerous mission, and I don't want you three to

714
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,702
get carried away.

715
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:58,903
-We won't.

716
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,306
We promise.

717
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,675
-Hey, what about me?

718
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,043
-Oh.

719
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,010
Come on.

720
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,412
You can ride with me.

721
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,815
-Uh, well, I've never actually--

722
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,016
(YELLS) flown before!

723
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,023
Hey, this is kind of fun.

724
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,825
-This is the last party I plan.

725
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,994
They're paying me peanuts-- peanuts I tell ya.

726
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,629
And they know I prefer walnuts.

727
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,798
-I think somebody spiked the nectar.

728
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,771
-Why do you care so much about our meadow?

729
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:37,375
It's our home, but I think it wouldn't matter much to you,

730
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,511
living up there in your big castle.

731
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,180
-Well, it matters to the king, so it matters to me.

732
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,382
He cares for every creature in his kingdom.

733
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:48,319
But there's more to it than that.

734
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,088
It might sound kinda weird, but I--

735
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,656
I feel kind alike I belong here.

736
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:54,125
-This may sound even weirder, but I sort of feel the same

737
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,460
way.

738
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,794
-I have some strange attachment to this meadow.

739
00:29:56,828 --> 00:30:00,331
-Like, you know, like, like you belong here.

740
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:17,382
-(SINGING) Come take my hand as we try to understand it.

741
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:22,821
How far our love goes, oh, no one could have planned it.

742
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:27,458
-(SINGING) Beyond tomorrow and past the furthest rainbows is

743
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:33,398
only half the distance to where our love goes.

744
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:38,903
-(SINGING) Although the world seems oh so vast around us,

745
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:44,209
it's just enormous that love so great has found us.

746
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:47,779
-(SINGING) Beyond the highest mountain.

747
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:54,252
-(SINGING) Farther than the deep river flows.

748
00:30:54,285 --> 00:31:00,191
-(SINGING) Beyond the moonlight, beyond forever,

749
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:05,129
that's how far it goes.

750
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:08,299
That's how far it goes.

751
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:16,841
-(SINGING) Our love.

752
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,042
-(SINGING) That's how far.

753
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:27,652
It's so astounding it's past our whole dimension, how far

754
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:32,056
our loves goes beyond our comprehension.

755
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:37,095
-(SINGING) Beyond the planets, and past the edge of evening,

756
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,998
and farther than the moon glows, that's

757
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,700
where our love goes.

758
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:48,606
-(SINGING) Beyond the ocean that's shimmering below us, as

759
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,077
far as winds of imagination blow us.

760
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:57,382
-(SINGING) I know I truly love you.

761
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:01,352
-(SINGING) Farther than the end of the snows.

762
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:09,360
-(SINGING) Always ascending, it's never ending.

763
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:14,932
That's how far it goes.

764
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,902
That's how far it goes.

765
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:36,387
-Oh, isn't it romantic?

766
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,222
-Bleh, gross me out.

767
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,992
-Ew, cooties.

768
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:44,829
-What do you mean construction has been delayed?

769
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,065
-I told you, it's fairies.

770
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,800
They sabotaged the equipment.

771
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,269
If they keep gumming up the works, putting me behind

772
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,805
schedule, I'll have to drop the whole job.

773
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,774
I got a big castle to work on down in Guntherberg.

774
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,776
-Oh, I don't believe it.

775
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,078
Those pesky little gnats.

776
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,113
How do you get rid of them?

777
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,482
-Look, I'm a contractor, not an exterminator.

778
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,158
-Father used to tell me you could catch more flies with

779
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,160
honey than with vinegar.

780
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:19,230
-I'm not so sure, boss.

781
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,431
-Don't worry.

782
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,433
I'll take care of those little flies--

783
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:27,205
I mean fairies, and you can get right back on schedule.

784
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,073
-I need to get back to the castle.

785
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,008
I've got to stop Medwin.

786
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,844
It's the only way to save the meadow.

787
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:33,845
-I know.

788
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:35,079
Please be careful.

789
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,315
I would like to see you again.

790
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,416
-You would?

791
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,651
I was hoping you'd say that.

792
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,753
Fiona.

793
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:42,954
Fiona.

794
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:43,888
-Right here, Master Tom.

795
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,089
-Wait.

796
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,524
I know a way to speed your journey.

797
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:49,427
[whistles]

798
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,997
The sooner you get there, the sooner you can return.

799
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,399
-Uh, but I've--

800
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,068
I've never piloted a bird before.

801
00:33:57,101 --> 00:34:00,204
-I've flown dangling from the beak of an owl once, but it

802
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,907
was not a flight I'd care to remember.

803
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,842
-Oh, there's nothing to it.

804
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,177
Goodbye.

805
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,311
-For now.

806
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,648
Just hold on, and don't look down.

807
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:11,849
[yelling]

808
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,358
-So, uh, what's your favorite dinner?

809
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,094
-I'd have to say house flies.

810
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,362
-Uh, what about fruit flies?

811
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,930
They're less filling.

812
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,832
-No, they taste great.

813
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:28,599
-Less filling.

814
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:29,434
-Taste great.

815
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,868
Oh.

816
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,771
OK, OK, less filling.

817
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,973
Oh, it's you again.

818
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,508
-I need a decoy.

819
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,877
And you, froggy, are going to be it.

820
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,847
-Uh, if you're interested in a decoy, might

821
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,749
I suggest the duck.

822
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,083
-Quiet.

823
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:50,121
And for you, my slow footed friend, it's time to fly the

824
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:53,524
not so friendly skies of Medwin Air.

825
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,927
-Help!

826
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,328
-[laughs]

827
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,331
When those fairies come to save you, I'll be ready.

828
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,567
They won't know what hit them.

829
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:11,876
[gulps]

830
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,044
-[laughs]

831
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:15,780
That was some mondo happening, man.

832
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,648
Let's party again tonight.

833
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:18,883
-No.

834
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,752
We have to be ready in case Medwin strikes again.

835
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,020
-What the--

836
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:26,657
u-- u-- unidentified flying turtle.

837
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,025
Everybody duck!

838
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,431
-Slocum, what's going on?

839
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,466
-Uh, uh, Medwin's got Bud.

840
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,901
We have to save him.

841
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:39,370
-That pond scum has gone too far this time, attacking

842
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:40,938
innocent creatures.

843
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,008
-You know, it might be kind of nice without that loud mouth

844
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:44,775
frog around.

845
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,210
-Bluebell!

846
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,813
-OK, OK, let's go save him.

847
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,214
-Take us to Medwin, Slocum.

848
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:51,382
-Hurry up.

849
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:54,852
I think I smell frog legs cooking.

850
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,954
Had you going.

851
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,122
-Give us a lift.

852
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,690
There's no time to lose.

853
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,699
-Oh, geez.

854
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,868
Your shell weighs a ton, Slocum.

855
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,437
I think my arms are about a foot longer.

856
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,873
-I-- it was around here somewhere.

857
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:18,109
[muffled shouting]

858
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:19,343
-There he is.

859
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,912
-Hey, what did they do to you, buddy?

860
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:24,148
-Ew, it looks like they tried to make a macrame hanger out

861
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,116
of his tongue.

862
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,651
[muffled shouting]

863
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,351
-What?

864
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,986
We can't understand you.

865
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,021
Let's untie him.

866
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:33,224
[muffled shouting]

867
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:36,394
-What are you trying to say?

868
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:41,132
-I said, it's a trap, and you're standing on fly paper.

869
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,134
-Uh oh!

870
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:44,769
-Gotcha, fairies.

871
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:48,205
-You won't get away with this, you-- you bully!

872
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,140
-[gasp]

873
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:50,541
Won't I?

874
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,647
This will teach you amateurs to mess with me.

875
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,382
Let's get back to the castle, Edgar.

876
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,418
We can fatten these little bugs up.

877
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:03,821
They'll make a tasty snack for you.

878
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,890
-Can I have one now, boss?

879
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,058
I'm so hungry.

880
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,726
I haven't caught any food since Tom

881
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,329
Thumb broke my glasses.

882
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,930
-Oh, that reminds me.

883
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:16,500
We have unfinished business with Master Thumb.

884
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:20,004
I would say it's about time we took care of him for good.

885
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,313
-I've never been to Medwin's room.

886
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,048
This whole wing's off limits.

887
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,950
I think that's it.

888
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,385
Thanks for the ride, Flicker.

889
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,221
-It was an honor, Master Tom.

890
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:38,756
-Oh, my.

891
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:42,293
From here on out, this tail is staying put on the ground.

892
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:43,427
-Come on.

893
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,230
Let's see what we can find out.

894
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:48,366
No wonder Medwin wants a new castle.

895
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,768
He needs a whole wing just to hold his ego.

896
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:03,748
-Now I can start building Medwinville without your

897
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,249
annoying interruptions.

898
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,684
There, Edgar.

899
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:10,054
Any time you need a snack, just help yourself.

900
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:14,325
Oh, you bird brain, I guess you'll just have to starve.

901
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,494
-You'll never get away with this, Medwin.

902
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,996
-And who's going to stop me?

903
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,064
The fairies?

904
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,366
I don't think so.

905
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,436
Oh, it's soon to be a reality, Edgar.

906
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:29,573
Those stupid knights will never find their king.

907
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,710
They've spread out to the four corners of the earth, not

908
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:38,349
realizing the king was (SING SONGS) right under their nose.

909
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:41,152
Oh, and when Blackthorn and his soldiers come tomorrow,

910
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:45,222
they'll take the king to the Saxons, leaving me with my own

911
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,857
army of black knights.

912
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:50,861
Then the kingdom will be mine once and for all.

913
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:54,632
[laughs]

914
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,299
-Thumbelina.

915
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:56,500
Thumbelina.

916
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,034
-Tom.

917
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,135
You're here.

918
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,370
-Don't worry, I'll get you out.

919
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:00,671
-He doesn't have wings.

920
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:05,076
What's he going to do, pole vault up here?

921
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,844
-Whoa, thanks, Tom.

922
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:10,514
Those bars were totally freaking out my free spirit.

923
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:11,015
-Pst.

924
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,717
Down here.

925
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,484
-Come on.

926
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,852
We'll have to climb down.

927
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,157
-That was close.

928
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,759
We were in real trouble there for a minute.

929
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,095
-We're still in trouble unless we find King Richard.

930
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,197
Medwin said he was right under our noses.

931
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,798
That means he must be held prisoner

932
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,166
somewhere in the castle.

933
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,670
-Well, these mouse tunnels go all this wing of the castle.

934
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,772
-I think you're onto something, Fiona.

935
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:36,006
We'll split up.

936
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,008
That way we'll have a better chance of finding him

937
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,443
-Let's go already.

938
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,845
-You and the fairies go that way.

939
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,480
Thumbelina and I will take this tunnel.

940
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:46,050
We'll meet back in my room.

941
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:46,817
-Look.

942
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,386
[snoring]

943
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,058
-King Richard!

944
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:54,725
Duke!

945
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:58,496
[barking]

946
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,965
-Oh, what is it, Duke?

947
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:01,932
Tom!

948
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,467
How did you get in here?

949
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,102
-We crawled through the mouse tunnels.

950
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,237
-We?

951
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,006
Ah, who is your enchanting friend?

952
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,708
-This is Princess Thumbelina.

953
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,443
She rules over the great meadow.

954
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,779
Thumbelina, meet King Richard.

955
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:17,381
-It's a pleasure to meet you, your majesty.

956
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:20,684
-Oh, the pleasure is all mine, princess.

957
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,187
-Tom, you've got to tell my knights where I am.

958
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,556
Only they can overcome Medwin and free me.

959
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,057
-But your knights are gone.

960
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,592
They're scattered throughout the land looking for you.

961
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,394
Medwin's ransoming you to the Saxons.

962
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,229
Blackthorn and his soldiers are coming in the

963
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,497
morning to get you.

964
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,999
Medwin's going to take over the kingdom.

965
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,868
-And his first plan is to destroy our meadow to build

966
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,370
his new castle.

967
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:42,606
-Oh, just this once, I wish I was as small as you, Tom.

968
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,276
Then I could leave the same way you got in.

969
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,078
Oh, but I'm afraid it looks hopeless.

970
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,547
-It's not hopeless, sire.

971
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,049
I'll fight the Saxons with my bare hands if I have to.

972
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,584
-Me too.

973
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,320
-I know your intentions are good, but Blackthorn and his

974
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:57,888
soldiers are a fierce lot.

975
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,858
And even if you could defeat them, you'll still have to get

976
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,059
past Medwin.

977
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,961
And he has the only key to this chamber.

978
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,396
-I know.

979
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,598
We'll get help from the animals and flower fairies.

980
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,233
-Don't worry, your majesty.

981
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,634
We'll get you out.

982
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:13,804
-What's so important about saving this king person?

983
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:14,972
-Yeah, yeah.

984
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,640
As far as I know, he's never given me any nuts.

985
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,409
-If We don't save the king from Medwin and the Saxons,

986
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,845
your meadow will be destroyed.

987
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,047
-Ah, this is a fairy problem.

988
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,582
I'm going back to my hive.

989
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:27,184
Any humans come near us, and they'll be

990
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,119
wearing a few new stingers.

991
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,387
-Let's just go to a new meadow.

992
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:34,024
-Look, everyone, if Medwin becomes king, no

993
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,326
place will be safe.

994
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,694
You know Medwin won't stop at the meadow.

995
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,430
Nutley, your forest will be next.

996
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:40,831
Where are you going to get nuts if your

997
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,166
trees are all gone?

998
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,969
And Bud, Slocum, your pond will be filled in.

999
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:48,506
There won't be any place for you to swim or get food.

1000
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,774
And it's not just a fairy problem.

1001
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:53,777
If there's no flowers, you can't father nectar for honey.

1002
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:57,781
And most of all, we can't move to a new meadow.

1003
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,149
This is our home.

1004
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,751
It's where we belong.

1005
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:05,222
If it's ruined, it will affect all your lives.

1006
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,791
Now, are you gonna help us or not?

1007
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,461
-You can count us in, Princess Thumbelina.

1008
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,463
-Hey, let's quit twiddling our thumbs.

1009
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:13,998
-I guess it's time we stood our ground.

1010
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:14,999
-Great.

1011
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,500
We have a lot of work to do.

1012
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:18,836
Bluebell, Impatiens, Daffodil, we could

1013
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,037
use your help planning.

1014
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,817
-I see them.

1015
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,019
They're coming.

1016
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:43,294
-Oh, finally, the end of Greenville, the beginning of

1017
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,495
Medwinville.

1018
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:45,195
-[caws]

1019
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,831
Greenville, nevermore.

1020
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,199
-Not yet.

1021
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,968
Not yet.

1022
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,169
All right.

1023
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:53,571
Charge!

1024
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,677
-What's going on?

1025
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,444
[gasp]

1026
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:01,912
Tom Thumb and Thumbelina.

1027
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:05,149
I should have gotten rid of them when I had the chance.

1028
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:06,884
-Major foul up, boss.

1029
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:10,354
-I haven't forgotten that you let them get away.

1030
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,856
You'd better hope they don't get past the guards.

1031
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:13,791
-[gulp]

1032
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:16,660
I'm hoping, I'm hoping.

1033
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:17,394
-Follow him.

1034
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,029
We've got to get that key.

1035
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:21,031
[sounds of confusion]

1036
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,333
-What are you doing?

1037
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:23,734
Get back in your ranks.

1038
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:27,171
-Whoa.

1039
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:28,238
Neat trick, Slocum.

1040
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,239
Thanks.

1041
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,141
-Hey, any time.

1042
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,109
-Come on, Daffodil.

1043
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,477
We need you.

1044
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,613
-Make peace, not war.

1045
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,382
Oh!

1046
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,317
OK, I changed me mind.

1047
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,454
Get ready to see some real flower power.

1048
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:03,607
-Hang on.

1049
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:11,248
-I'm not gonna let a bunch of fairies stop me.

1050
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:14,785
-I think it's time to bring out the secret weapon.

1051
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,694
-Oh, what are you going to do?

1052
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:24,328
Tongue me to death?

1053
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,996
Give me warts?

1054
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,298
-Uh, no, I can't do anything to you.

1055
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,868
That's why I brought my friend.

1056
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:34,204
Teddy here is very affectionate and likes to give

1057
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:35,773
great big hugs.

1058
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,778
-Mud suits you, Daffodil.

1059
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,046
-Thanks.

1060
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,381
It's 100% natural, you know, and good for the complexion.

1061
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,884
-I wonder what happened to Tom and Thumbelina.

1062
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,319
-Maybe we'd better go see if they need help.

1063
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,289
Come on, everyone.

1064
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:55,192
-Y-- you're not going to leave me alone with--

1065
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:57,261
with him, are you?

1066
00:44:57,294 --> 00:45:01,131
[growling]

1067
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:04,802
-Fie on you, Tom Thumb.

1068
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,170
-Fie?

1069
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:09,106
-Edgar, take care of those pests.

1070
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:12,009
[cawing]

1071
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,410
-Tom!

1072
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:24,288
Hole in one, Flicker.

1073
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:25,189
Go back inside.

1074
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,657
We have to find Tom.

1075
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,925
-Hey, ouch!

1076
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,760
Ooh, ah, stop it, please!

1077
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:31,595
Ah, ooh, ah!

1078
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:32,329
Hey, ouch!

1079
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:33,931
Ooh, ah, stop it!

1080
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,306
[screams]

1081
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,942
Drop the key, thumb boy, or I'll put the squeeze on your

1082
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:47,044
little princess and her bird.

1083
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,612
-Don't do it, Tom.

1084
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:49,446
Save the king.

1085
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,614
-Push it down here.

1086
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,749
Well, what are you waiting for?

1087
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,585
[muffled screaming]

1088
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,295
-King Richard.

1089
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,430
Down here.

1090
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,831
I told you we'd get you out.

1091
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:10,467
Now let's see if we can do the hardest part of all.

1092
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,035
This key weighs a ton.

1093
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:13,370
-Can we help?

1094
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,572
-Hey, this teamwork thing works pretty good.

1095
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,306
-Choose us.

1096
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,674
Choose us.

1097
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,676
-Let's quit twiddling our thumbs and get moving.

1098
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,744
-Come on.

1099
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,479
This guy's gotta be itching to get out.

1100
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:32,222
-Oh, you don't know how good it feels to

1101
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:33,824
be out of that prison.

1102
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:35,058
[barking]

1103
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,229
I don't believe it.

1104
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:41,598
How did you get by Medwin?

1105
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,935
-Uh, we got by with a little help from our friends.

1106
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:51,642
-Thanks to you all, this kingdom has been saved.

1107
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:53,043
-And the meadow.

1108
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,179
-Yes, and the meadow.

1109
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,514
-Tom, please step forward.

1110
00:46:57,548 --> 00:47:00,217
You have been a brave and loyal soldier, and

1111
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,785
I owe you my life.

1112
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:04,988
You have proven it's not the size of the man that matters,

1113
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,624
but the bravery of his deeds.

1114
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,727
I dub thee Sir Thomas Thumb, knight of the realm.

1115
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:12,863
-It is an honor to serve you, your majesty.

1116
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:16,466
-Thanks to you and your flower fairies and the animals of the

1117
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,703
great meadow, our kingdom will remain a beautiful place to

1118
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:20,637
live.

1119
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,139
-I must return to the meadow soon.

1120
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,273
-I know.

1121
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,175
But I wish you didn't have to go.

1122
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,944
-You could come with me.

1123
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,445
-I'd give anything to say yes.

1124
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:31,949
But all my life, I've known I had a purpose, that I was

1125
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,918
meant for big things even though I was small.

1126
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,687
Now finally, I'm a knight.

1127
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,655
But along with that comes duty.

1128
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,258
And I can't desert the king, not when I've waited this long

1129
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:44,061
to prove myself.

1130
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:45,128
-I understand.

1131
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:46,230
I have my duties too.

1132
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:47,764
-Oh, man.

1133
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:49,800
What a bummer.

1134
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,469
-I'd like to give you something before you go,

1135
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:56,173
something for you to remember me by.

1136
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,741
-Where did you get this?

1137
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:58,742
-I don't know.

1138
00:47:58,775 --> 00:47:59,409
I--

1139
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:00,677
I've always had it.

1140
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,645
I don't think it's valuable or anything.

1141
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,460
-At last, we have found you.

1142
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:17,027
-Me?

1143
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,262
-Yes, Tom Thumb.

1144
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:20,864
You are the lost prince of the meadow.

1145
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,466
-I am?

1146
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:23,467
-He is?

1147
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,868
-He is?

1148
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:26,270
-Of course.

1149
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:28,272
It all makes sense now.

1150
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,741
-Princess Thumbelina, you have served me well.

1151
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:33,710
It is time you were made queen of the meadow.

1152
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,947
And with King Richard's permission, Tom Thumb will be

1153
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:37,781
your king.

1154
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:38,949
-Of course.

1155
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:40,150
Of course.

1156
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:42,519
I always knew that boy had it in him.

1157
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:46,923
-Tom, Thumbelina, together you will rule the meadow side by

1158
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:49,860
side, that is if it's all right with you both.

1159
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:51,895
-I guess it's all right.

1160
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,263
-Far out.

1161
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:54,598
[whistles]

1162
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:58,735
-As for you three, I'm taking your wings--

1163
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:02,272
and giving you new ones in honor of your bravery in the

1164
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,007
face of danger.

1165
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:05,442
-Wow.

1166
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:08,512
These are awesome, you know, if a little pretentious.

1167
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:09,713
-Cool.

1168
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:12,049
We'll really be able to make the scene in these.

1169
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,818
-I can't wait to give them a spin.

1170
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:18,855
-But with these wings comes more responsibility.

1171
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:22,626
You'll need to work extra hard to keep them, so I don't want

1172
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,294
to hear any more bad reports.

1173
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,397
-Your majesty, what is to be done with the prisoner?

1174
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:31,902
Medwin, you deserve severe punishment for your actions.

1175
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,938
But you are still my son.

1176
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,807
-May I make a suggestion.

1177
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,941
-Of course.

1178
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:40,143
-He wanted to live in Medwinville.

1179
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,379
I say we let him.

1180
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,381
-I think that's a splendid idea.

1181
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:47,317
-What do you think you're doing?

1182
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:50,287
Hey, hey, I don't like this.

1183
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,489
I don't like this one bit.

1184
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:54,458
[cawing]

1185
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,660
-Nevermore, Master Edgar.

1186
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,729
Nevermore.

1187
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:02,632
-Mm, I've tasted deer flies and horse flies, but never

1188
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,701
bird flies.

1189
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:09,139
-I pronounce you husband and wife, and king and queen.

1190
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,674
[cheering]

1191
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:12,109
OAKLEY (VOICEOVER): From then on, the people of the castle

1192
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:13,477
and the creatures of the meadow

1193
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,078
lived in perfect harmony.

1194
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:19,516
And the two kingdoms became one.

1195
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,985
FIONA (VOICEOVER): Oh, my, that was beautiful.

1196
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,920
A regular fairy tale wedding.

1197
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,123
DAFFODIL (VOICEOVER): Why do they call them fairy tales?

1198
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:27,290
We don't have tails.

1199
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:28,191
BLUEBELL AND IMPATIENS (VOICEOVER):

1200
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:29,526
Say goodbye, Daffodil.

1201
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:30,927
DAFFODIL (VOICEOVER): Goodbye, Daffodil.

1202

THEME SONG: Hi dum deedle dee hi dum dee dum.

Hi dum deedle dee hi dum.

Hi deedlee deedlee dee.

1206
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:54,584
As the first bright glimmers of sunshine bravely peek from

1207
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:58,355
the horizon, there's an orchestration of creatures

1208
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,524
that I always find surprising.

1209
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:04,494
With the animals in unison, each cow and duck and bird,

1210
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:07,998
there is music unlike anything you've heard.

1211
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,499
[animal sounds]

1212
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,903
It's another typical morning in the meadow we abide in.

1213
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:16,640
And the bees are busy a buzzing off to where the

1214
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:17,841
honey's hiding.

1215
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:20,977
And the birdies all are chirping with the crickets

1216
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,279
every place.

1217
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:24,948
And the soggy froggy chorus sings the bass.

1218
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,416
[frog sounds]

1219
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,618
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum dee dum.

Hi deedlee deedlee dee.

1227
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,836
There is nothing nice as our field mice.

1228
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,871
They practice many hours.

1229
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:50,941
And they fill the air with a big fanfare on

1230
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:52,375
fiddles made of flowers.

1231
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:56,513
And the magic of the meadow is the music in the air.

1232
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:59,683
Why, you never heard a symphony so rare.

1233
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:00,684
[clucking]

1234
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,819
Every day begins with an overture,

1235
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,088
a serenade of pleasure.

1236
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,758
In the big tree trunks are a few chipmunks that warble

1237
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,026
every measure.

1238
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:14,030
Every billy goat and nanny croon a tune as sweet as pies

1239
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,366
while 100 humming birdies harmonize.

1240
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:20,403
Hum, hum, hum, hum, Hi dum deedle dee hi dum dee dum.

1241
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,472
Hi dum deedle dee hi dum dee dum.
