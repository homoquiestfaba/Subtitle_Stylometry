I love you, Dad!

174
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,165
True love is hard to find.

175
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,332
Sometimes you think you have true love,

176
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:52,775
and then you catch the early flight
home from San Diego,

177
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,076
and a couple of nude people
jump out of your bathroom blindfolded

178
00:11:56,148 --> 00:12:00,244
like a goddamn magic show,
ready to double-team your girlfriend...

179
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:04,085
It stops right there
and it continues right here,

180
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,523
because I think what Mitch is trying to say
is that true love is blind.

181
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,794
Let's raise our glasses,
whatever we got in front of us.

182
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,855
Salute. Health and happiness.

183
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:15,797
Cheers, everybody.

184
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,336
I love you so much, Frankie.
I love you.

185
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,270
I'm not a talker.

186
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,638
I love you.
Congratulations.

187
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,057
I thought you said near campus.
This is practically on-campus. It's sick.

188
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,329
- This is great.
- How did you land this place?

189
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,303
I don't know, it was pretty easy, actually.

190
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:56,001
A professor lived here for, like,
30 years, and then he died.

191
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,440
That's awesome!

192
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,904
That's awesome.

193
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,244
A little housewarming.

194
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,250
To new beginnings.

195
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:07,778
Thanks.

196
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,259
Actually, I gave this to you
for your wedding.

197
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,591
This model?

198
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,995
No, this exact one.

199
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:21,798
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,802
I'm embarrassed.
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,098
It's okay.

202
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,900
I hope you like it.

203
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,974
I love it.
Thank you.

204
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,034
This place is unbelievable.

205
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,170
- You like it?
- How could you still be depressed?

206
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:37,648
This is the probably the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

207
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,309
- Us?
- Yeah, us.

208
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,252
Do not get selfish on me here, okay?
Now stay with me.

209
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,256
You put a bar in over there, right?

210
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,522
Couple La-Z-Boys to fill it out, a smarter
couch. You could put a hot tub anywhere.

211
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,323
Max, can you earmuff it for me?

212
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,395
We're gonna get so much ass here,
it's gonna be sick.

213
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,526
I'm talking crazy, boy-band ass.

214
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,900
That sounds like a lot of fun, but

215
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,963
I need a little time to get
my life back together.

216
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,908
We need to throw a big
kick-ass party to start things off.

217
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,242
Absolutely.
Break it in a little, meet the neighbors.

218
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,248
Come on, Mitch.
You know what I'm talking about.

219
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,578
Break it in.

220
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:15,109
The real estate guy was really
adamant about not having...

221
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,089
I don't think you realize what
a huge opportunity this is for you.

222
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,853
Girls love a guy who's in your
particular situation.

223
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,087
What situation?

224
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,220
Mitch, you're on the rebound.

225
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,663
You're like an injured fawn
nursed back to health,

226
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,566
who's finally gonna be rereleased
into the wilderness.

227
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,193
[Glass breaking]
Sorry.

228
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,862
[Baby crying]
Please be careful.

229
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,601
- I'm sorry. You okay?
- Don't say sorry to me, say it to the baby.

230
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,267
- You upset him.
- Sorry, baby.

231
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,243
It's okay. It happens.

232
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,610
We should go tropical with this thing.

233
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,946
Like sand from wall to wall. I know a great
sand guy, we'll get it at price.

234
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,075
Sand in here?

235
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,746
Or foam, whatever.
Something in here.

236
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,449
- You understand what I'm talking about?
- Absolutely.

237
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:54,118
I'm good either way.
Just need to run it by Marissa.

238
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,720
I'm messing with you guys!
It's a joke!

239
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,197
[Baby cries]

240
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,166
It's not funny.
And now the baby is upset.

Hey!

246
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,412
Hey, honey!

247
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,514
I brought you an iced tea!

248
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,818
No, thanks. I got a fresh beer.

249
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,085
Can you turn that off for a second?

250
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,819

Wow. That's really loud.

252
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,464
Yeah. Thanks.

253
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:38,663
I took the restrictor plate off,
give the Red Dragon a little more juice.

254
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:42,970
But let's keep that on the down low.
She's not exactly street legal.

255
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,202
Hey, Mike!

256
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,403
Right.

257
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,538
- So, what's up?
- Nothing much.

258
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,447
I was hoping we might get to those
thank you notes tomorrow night.

259
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,042
Honey, I got Mitch's thing tomorrow night.

260
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,452
Oh, that's right.
I totally forgot.

261
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,285
But I can skip it.

262
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,382
Oh! No.

263
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,956
Don't be silly.

264
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:06,897
I mean, I wouldn't want you changing
your whole life just for me.

265
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,633
I'll give Lara a call
and we'll plan a girls' night.

266
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,001
- It'll be fun.
- Thanks.

267
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,801
You're the best.

268
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,701
Just as long as you promise to take it easy,
you know.

269
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:21,042
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

270
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,148
You've come a long way since Frank the
Tank, and we don't want him coming back.

271
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,812
Honey, Frank the Tank
is not coming back, okay?

272
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:32,016
That part of me is over.
It's water under the bridge.

273
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,659
I promise.

274
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:46,130
[Crowd cheering]

275
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,600
Nice, right?

276
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,608
This is incredible.
How did you do this?

277
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,270
With all the people here,
and the speakers.

278
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,813
I thought we were having
a small get-together.

279
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,543
It's one of many
small get-togethers.

280
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,517
That's why you got the house, brother.

281
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:02,109
You're having fun?

282
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,712
- I'm having a great time.
- Good.

283
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,783
What else have you got planned?
A student band or something?

284
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,191
Yeah, that's it.

285
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,698
I got a student alt rock band
coming on stage next.

286
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:15,392
I own six Speaker Cities.

287
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,300
I'm worth $3.5 million,
that the government knows about.

288
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,305
I got more electronics up there
than a damn KISS concert.

289
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:25,742
You think I'd roll out that kind of red carpet
for a fuckin' marching band?

290
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,301
Just make sure you can see the stage.

291
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,780
Excuse me. Pardon me.

292
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:33,045
I just want to get through this door,
if you don't mind.

293
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,278
Thank you.

294
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:37,082
This is the guy I was talking about.
This is his house.

295
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:40,591
- What's up, man?
- No, that's my friend, Mitch.

296
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,127
My friend Mitch, he owns the house.

297
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,892
Anyway, come hit this right here.
You need to hit this.

298
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:50,594
No, I appreciate it, but I told my wife
I wouldn't drink tonight.

299
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:54,434
Besides, I've got a big day tomorrow.
But you guys have a great time.

300
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,997
A big day? Doing what?

301
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:59,976
Well, actually,
pretty nice little Saturday.

302
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,637
We're going to Home Depot.

303
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,176
Buy some wallpaper,
maybe get some flooring.

304
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,209
Stuff like that. Maybe Bed, Bath
and Beyond, I don't know.

305
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:10,777
I don't know if we'll have enough time.

306
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,250
You know what? Give me that thing.
I'll do one.

307
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:19,559
He gonna do one!
He gonna do one!

308
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,364
That's a talented man right there.

309
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,576
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Fill it up again!

310
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,875
God, that's good.
It's so good!

311
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:38,541
Once it hits your lips,
it's so good.

312
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:42,175
Thank you very much, guys. This will be
happening at this house all year.

313
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,313
So just get ready,
don't burn yourselves out tonight.

314
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:48,257
I wanna thank you very much for coming to
the official Mitch Martin Freedom Festival.

315
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,630
For those who don't know
who Mitch Martin is,

316
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:56,826
he's the very successful,

342
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,787
Yeah, that's me.

343
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,289
This party is great.
Nice work.

344
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,724
My friends put it on for me.

345
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:32,320
They're kind of rereleasing me
out into the wild.

346
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,661
What are you talking about?

347
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,291
Nothing. Sorry.

I'm sorry.

360

We're going streaking through the quad
and into the gymnasium.

361
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:16,904
Come on, everybody!

362
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,533
Come on, Snoop!

363
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,333
Snoop-a-loop!

Snoop!

365
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,873
No, it's cool. I'm cool.

366
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,883
Bring your green hat. Let's go.

367
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,351
Come on, everybody, we're going!

368

369
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,752
Man, man.
Man, put the music back on.

370
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,384
Let's get
the party back cracking up in here.

371
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,222
[Crowd cheers]

372
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:38,956
Whoo! Come on!

373
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,294
We're streaking.
Come on!

374
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,096
Come on, every...
We're... come on!

375
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,899
Whoo! Whoo!

376
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,339
We're streaking.
We're streaking!

377
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:52,433
Whooo!

378
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,171
Come on!

379
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:56,639
Oh, tell her!

380
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,582
Marissa, I totally forgot.

381
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,950
I know it's a little belated, but we got you
the perfect wedding present!

382
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:06,115
Come on, you guys, I told you,
you don't have to get me anything.

383
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:10,127
Our friend Ashley had this guy come over
and teach a blow job class.

384
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:12,862
- It was incredible.
- A class?

385
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,729
And he's really good,
so we had to book him way in advance.

386
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,427
Why should I go to a class?

387
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,336
Bernard should be the one going to class.
I swear, the man is orally challenged.

388
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:25,704
- Wait a second, is that guy...

Oh, my God.

390
00:22:28,813 --> 00:22:31,179
That's disgusting!

391
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,948
Why am I looking at that?

392
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,580
Why are you slowing down?

393
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:39,418
Just drive. Go.
[Horns honking]

394
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:41,180
Frank?

395
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,622
No way.

396
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,786
Frank!

397
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,089
Hey, honey.

398
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,260
What the hell are you doing?

399
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:56,433
We're streaking. We're going up
through the quad to the gymnasium.

400
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,173
Who's streaking?

401
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,075
There's more coming.

402
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,713
Frank, get in the car.

403
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,682
- Everybody's doing it.
- Now!

404
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,739
Okay.

405
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,617
Whoa! Scooch over.

406
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:21,525
Hey, ladies.

407
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,258
Hey, Frank.
Looks like it's a little cold out there, huh?

408

409
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,896

415

Good morning.

416
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,061
Now, that was a party.

417
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,008
Since when are you so shy?

418
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,841
No, I'm not.
I just...

419
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:11,405
Did I snore last night?
Sometimes I snore when I'm drunk.

420
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,845
I don't remember.

421
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,979
I don't think so.

422
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,722
Listen, about last night.

423
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:26,962
I just got out of a very serious
and traumatic relationship.

424
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,964
I'm kind of in a weird place right now.

425
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,268
What?

426
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:35,637
Relax, Rich, it's not a big deal.

Mitch, with an "M."

428
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,606
Right. Look.

429
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:47,919
Whatever. We were just having a little fun.
You have nothing to worry about.

430
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,284
No.

431
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:51,823
Yeah, you're right.
I'm okay with it.

432
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:54,155
It's casual. I was just...

433
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,956
I got to go to class, so...

434
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:00,294
So, how do we do this? Shall I...

435
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,459
You want to leave me your number?

436
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:05,197
You don't even have to worry about it.

437
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,941
See you around.

438
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:14,671

458
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,396
- About three fire hazards over here.

Hello, Mitch, Bernard.
I see you guys haven't changed much.

Who is this?

462
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:25,045
Remember Cheese,
Rodney's kid brother?

463
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:29,019
Actually, my name isn't Cheese anymore.
It's Gordon Pritchard.

464
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,316
Oh, yeah!

465
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,323
Cheese!

466
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,916
Didn't we lock you in a dumpster one time?

467
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:36,552
I got out.

468
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:39,655
Cool, man.
I'm glad you did.

469

- You had a good time last night?
- Yeah.

470
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,771
There might be some whippits
lying around if you want them.

471
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,365
- No, thanks. I'm working.
- Working what?

472
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,602
Campus patrol?

473
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,912
- Try again.
- You a Jehovah's Witness?

474
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,777
- [Beanie and Gordon laugh]
- I'm the dean.

475
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,874
Dean Pritchard. Yeah.

476
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:02,079
And as of this morning,
this house has been rezoned.

477
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:06,214
It is now exclusively
for campus use only.

478
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,816
What are you talking about?

479
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:11,454
You can't just do that. I've already paid
the first and last month's rent!

480
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,792
Take a look at that.

481
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:17,632
You have a week to vacate the premises,
and I thank you for your cooperation.

482
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:19,000
Great.

483
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,272
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely not.

484
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,832
It's been good seeing you guys.
It looks like you're doing great.

485
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,818
Frank, this is a safe place.

486
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,826
It's a place where we can feel free
sharing our feelings.

487
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:47,331
Think of my office as a nest
in a tree of trust and understanding.

488
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,923
We can say anything here.

489
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:50,926
Anything?

490
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,499
It's okay, honey.
That's why we came.

491
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:04,472
Well, I guess I...
Deep down I'm feeling a little confused.

492
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,608
I mean, suddenly you get married

493
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,247
and you're supposed
to be this entirely different guy.

494
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,153
I don't feel different.

495
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:16,016
Take yesterday, for example.

496
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:20,155
We were out at the Olive Garden
for dinner, which was lovely.

497
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,926
And...

498
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,960
I happened to look over during the meal
and see a waitress taking an order,

499
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:32,237
and I found myself wondering
what color her underpants might be.

500
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,634
Her panties.

501
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:42,046
Odds are they're probably
basic white, cotton underpants.

502
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,750
But I started thinking,
"Well, maybe they're silk panties."

503
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,554
"Maybe it's a thong."

504
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:54,030
"Maybe it's something really cool
that I don't even know about."

505
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,591
You know? And I started feeling...

506
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:58,991
What?

507
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,730
I thought we were in the trust tree,
in the nest. Are we not?

508
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:05,503
- We are. It's okay.
- Okay?

509
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,741
It's okay. Please continue.

510
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,775
I don't know
where I was going with that.

511
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,385
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that now that I'm married,

512
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:22,256
I'm definitely feeling
a little freaked out about the fact

513

with only one person

514

your San Diego trip was a blast!

516
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,068
Yeah.

517
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,574
How was Hooters?

518
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,701
I actually didn't go to Hooters.

519
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,370
Yeah, right.

520
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,913

521
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,346
No, thanks.

522
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,906
Listen. I got a call from Manetti.

523
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:51,081
He tells me that your Sunshine Square
proposal is totally fucked.

524
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,680
What's wrong with it?

525
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:56,215
Well, for one thing, it violates
the zoning restrictions set forth

526
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,923
in the National Historical
Preservation Act of 1966.

527
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,728
Most notably, clause four.

528
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,063
Shall I continue?

529
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,660
- Actually, I'm familiar with that item...
- Honey.

530

- Hi, Dad, am I interrupting?
- No, come in.

531

Darcie, this is Mitch Martin.

- Great. You know,

536
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,354
She's an angel.

537
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,659
It makes me sound an old man, but I can't
believe how fast she's growing up.

538
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,526
- Dad, stop.
- I'm sorry honey, but it's true.

539
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:38,092
To think that in just seven months
you'll be graduating from high school!

Not too bad.

I thought maybe I could crash here
tonight, if that's all right.

551

some personal stuff.

the neighborhood drunk and naked?

553
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:30,412
That and some other stuff.

Gentlemen, we're discussing
a brand-new way to look at a fraternity.

Gentlemen, we're discussing
a brand-new way to look at a fraternity.

558
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:45,227
In other words, forget all the normal rules
that apply to both college and society,

559
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,067
because this is a very big idea,
my friends.

560
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,304
We are talking about a non-exclusive,
egalitarian brotherhood

561
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,346
where community status
and more importantly, age,

562
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,644
have no bearing whatsoever.

563
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:00,912
Yeah? From the guy who probably
won't get in.

564
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,682
- I go to school here.
- Okay.

565
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,714
I was curious, what association
will you have with the actual university?

566
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:09,920
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.

567
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:13,328
Legally speaking,
there will be a loose affiliation,

568
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:16,765
but we will give nothing back
to the academic community.

569
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:20,794
As well as provide no public service
of any kind. This much I promise.

570
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,102
What the hell is going on here?

enough to grace us with his presence.

- The Godfather!
- [Applause]

574

He lives here, he sleeps 20 feet away.

to Uncle Mitch for a second.

There you go, buddy.

579
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,595
- How long have these people been here?
- All day.

580
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,262
That party we had last night
has given us all kinds of street cred.

You've got to be kidding me.

You heard Pritchard, all right?
We're obligated to do this.

586
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:07,711
This house, he says, is zoned specifically
for social services and student housing.

587
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:09,617
Fraternity solves both of those.

588

But this is my house.
I live here, Beanie.

I'm 30 years old.
None of us are enrolled in the college.

590

I understand that. You're focused
on all the wrong sort of details.

591
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:22,567
Did you or did you not
have a good time at the party?

you had an awesome time.

I'm trying to ask Mitch whether
he had an awesome time.

596
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,838
- I had a good time.
- Okay, that's good.

597
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,937
Wouldn't you want those good times
to keep going?

598
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,346
- More good...
- God. I mean...

599
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:42,182
I don't understand. I don't know why it's
so hard for you to admit you want this.

600
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:45,621
We got 40 guys that want this.
There must be a reason for it.

Look, I appreciate your enthusiasm.

602
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,928

I've had a hell of a day,
an even worse month.

604

And the fact is,
I've got 40 strangers out in my living room

605
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,768
and all I want to do is
get some fuckin' sleep.

606
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:07,107
So, I'm sorry, but we're not
starting a fraternity.

607

I don't know why you got to do it
in front of the kid, with the "F'ing."

608

say "earmuffs" to him.

you let down Max, most importantly.

850
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,317
- Yes, I'm hurt.
- [Groaning]

851
00:47:06,189 --> 00:47:08,487
Bob's not here. They're on the rocks.

852
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:14,320
You've outdone yourself once again.

853
00:47:14,397 --> 00:47:17,332
It's nice, right?
Spanish, what the hell are you doing?

854
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,096
Man, I'm just getting some water, yo.
This suit is crazy hot.

855
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,970
Put your head on. Are you nuts?
That can be very traumatic for these kids.

856
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,406
- You're right, I'm sorry, sir.
- Don't "sorry" me.

857
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,944
Shake the tail when you walk, man.
You're better than that.

858
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,172
Take it easy.

859
00:47:30,246 --> 00:47:31,838
You don't see me breaking
the fourth wall.

860
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:33,913
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

861
00:47:33,983 --> 00:47:35,848
- Nice costume.
- Thanks a lot.

862
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:38,183
- This is a great party.
- When'd you get here?

863
00:47:38,254 --> 00:47:41,189
Just a few minutes ago.
This is my boyfriend, Mark.

864
00:47:41,257 --> 00:47:44,693
Flew over from Colorado yesterday.
This is Mitch and Beanie.

865
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,319
How's it hanging, boys?

866
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,454
Pleasure to meet you.

867
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:50,090
So, listen, somebody told me

868
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:52,600
you guys are in a fraternity,
is that right?

869
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:55,103
- No.
- A fraternity. Is that true?

870
00:47:55,171 --> 00:47:59,801
Not really. I mean, no.
It's more kind of like a social club.

871
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:02,344
We just kinda watch football
and hang out.

872
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,972
Hang out and spank each other, I bet.

873
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,175
It's not like that.
We don't take it too seriously...

874
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:10,344
Blue! How come there's no ice
in my lemonade?

875
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,887
Sorry, sir!

876
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:14,389
You drop down
and you give me ten!

877
00:48:14,457 --> 00:48:15,822
- Now!
- Yes, sir.

878
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:17,617
Let's go!

879
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:18,854
That's Frank.

880
00:48:20,096 --> 00:48:22,929
I'm gonna go ahead and give you these.
It's my work phone. Call me.

881
00:48:22,999 --> 00:48:24,591
Speaker City. I own all six locations.

882
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:28,866
Max wants to open up his gifts,
but I thought maybe one would be all right?

883
00:48:28,938 --> 00:48:31,839
Come on in here, Maxy.
You guys mind giving me a minute?

884
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:34,638
We'll talk surround sound
and everything else later. I'll cut you a deal.

885
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,736
I'm not gonna hold you over
the coals for it.

886
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:38,474
How you doing, bud?
What a day!

887
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:41,312
We can open Uncle Frank's,
but we got to wait for the others.

888
00:48:41,384 --> 00:48:44,046
I don't know who's more excited,
Frank or Max.

889
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,816
Rip it up! Go at there. What is it?

890
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,121
Could it be a space ship?
Let's see what we got!

891
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,320
Yay!

892
00:48:53,229 --> 00:48:55,823
What do you think, Max, huh?
It's got three speeds.

Excuse me.
I'll have one of those.

896
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:15,080
I'm Mark. What's your name?

897
00:49:15,151 --> 00:49:16,243
Tracy.

898
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,350
Nice meeting you, Tracy.

899
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,459
- Right on there.
- There we go.

900
00:49:23,526 --> 00:49:26,017
Okay, you can go back out
and play now.

901
00:49:26,095 --> 00:49:27,357
Come on.

902
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:30,991
There. Take your doll. Okay.

903
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,798
I think she likes you.
She ignores most people.

904
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,362
I feel honored.

905
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:43,706
So, Mark, he seems like
an interesting guy.

906
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,304
He's harmless.

907
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,982
- How long have you two been together?
- Two years now.

908
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:52,582
I told him I had a crush on you
in high school and I think I got him jealous.

909
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:54,555
You had a crush on me?

910
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:57,821
You got to be kidding me.
I was obsessed with you.

911
00:49:57,894 --> 00:50:02,456
Not in a dangerous way, you know.
I just watched you a lot, from a distance.

912
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:04,727
How come you never
asked me out then?

913
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,395
You were pretty intimidating back then.

914
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:11,930
You were always with older guys.
You had that Whitesnake jean jacket.

915
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:15,136
You smoked Marlboro Reds.
You were way out of my league.

916
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,942
I still have the Whitesnake
jean jacket.

917
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:23,916
I'm still pretty intimidated by you.

918
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:31,416
You're bad.

919
00:50:31,594 --> 00:50:34,290
You're right. I am bad.

920
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,028
I'm sorry...

921
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,400
- I guess we're not knocking?
- Excuse me.

922
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:43,769
Excuse me, I've got to get
back to work.

You know you can't, buddy.
It's guy code. Okay?

926
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:56,977

I'll see you out there.

- She's a beauty, ain't she?
- Yeah.

938
00:51:42,498 --> 00:51:44,693
What kind of gun is this?

939
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,667
That's a tranquilizer gun.

940
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:50,001
If any of these little fuckers decide to freak
out on the kids,

941
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:51,506
I get to take them down.

942

Ain't that right, mother?
What?

943
00:51:55,144 --> 00:51:57,237
That's what I thought. Shut up.

Hey, be careful with that.

945
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:02,646
That's the most powerful
tranq gun on the market.

Got her in Mexico.

947
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,719
- Cool.
- Yeah, it is cool.

948
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:09,724
They say it could puncture
the skin of a rhino from a hundred...

has become quite an inconvenience
for us, okay?

1005
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:53,943
And as student body president,
you approved their temporary status.

1006
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:58,010
Unfortunately, you alone
have the ability to revoke it.

So, we're gonna need you to
go ahead and do that.

Everybody loves those guys.

1190
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,184
That's very kind,
but I insist, I'll pay.

1191
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:32,186
Your money, it's not good here.

1192
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:34,620
- Okay.
- I look forward to pledging next semester.

1193
01:06:36,091 --> 01:06:39,857
Okay, now don't you think
this is going a little far?

1194
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:43,057
I heard one of your pledges died.
Is that true?

1195
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:46,735
Well, yes.
But he was really old.

1196
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:49,635
And I feel pretty confident that
when we get the autopsy back,

1197
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:51,935
it'll show that it was probably
of natural causes.

1198
01:06:52,007 --> 01:06:56,273
Look, to be honest, you're really not
the person I thought you were.

1199
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:58,779
But it's okay. It's not a big deal.

1200
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,146
I think that I am that person.

1201
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:04,846
And I feel more like myself now
than I have in a really long time.

1202
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,048
So, that's why you go around
harassing young women?

1203
01:07:08,123 --> 01:07:09,852
- Doing what?
- The caterer.

1204
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:12,951
At the birthday party.
Mark told me about her.

1205
01:07:13,028 --> 01:07:16,395
Wait a second.
I didn't want to say anything,

1206
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:19,696
but Mark is the one
who was acting inappropriate.

1207
01:07:19,768 --> 01:07:21,963
- You are unbelievable.
- It's true.

1208
01:07:22,037 --> 01:07:23,834
Hey, look who it is.

1209
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,567
Hey, Mitch.

1210
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:27,006
Darcie, hey.

1211
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:30,045
Hi. I've been meaning to call you.

1212
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:32,410
I just didn't want you
to worry about my dad.

1213
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:35,314
He doesn't know anything,
so it's totally cool.

1214
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:36,578
Her dad?

1215
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:38,414
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1216
01:07:39,154 --> 01:07:43,989
You know, it's nothing, really.
I mean, they actually work together.

1217
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:49,993
We gotta run, 'cause we got this prom
committee thing, so I'll see you around.

1218
01:07:50,065 --> 01:07:50,997
Sorry.

1219
01:07:51,066 --> 01:07:52,590
Bye.

1220
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:55,428
Prom committee thing?

1221
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:57,995
That I actually can explain.

1222
01:07:58,073 --> 01:08:00,132
Right, I'm sure you can.

1223
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:02,769
- I have to go.
- Please wait a second.

1224
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:05,746
No, really. I have to go.

1225
01:08:10,185 --> 01:08:12,653
Hey. Chicks.

1226
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:14,655
Don't worry for her.

1227
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:17,886
Love, it's a motherfucker.

1228
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:53,655
<i>Dear Mitch, if you're holding this letter,</i>
<i>you already know.</i>

1229
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:58,029
<i>The house has been boarded up.</i>
<i>The windows, the doors, everything.</i>

1230
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,933
<i>We're at the Comfort Inn,</i>
<i>room 112.</i>

1231
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:03,028
<i>I love you. Frank.</i>

1232
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:07,737
<i>Due to these infractions,</i>
<i>not only will your house be repossessed,</i>

1233
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:11,302
<i>but those of you who are students</i>
<i>will be expelled from the university</i>

1234
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:14,543
<i>for your participation in</i>

1235
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:18,314

1236
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:20,252
<i>[Sirens wailing]</i>

1237
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:25,821
<i>Good. Believe me,</i>

1238
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:30,958
<i>the actions taken by the student council</i>

1240
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:38,105

1241
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:43,044
<i>[Static]</i>

1242
01:09:43,713 --> 01:09:45,408
He can't do that.

1243
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:47,540
This guy's playing hardball.

1244
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:51,648
I got to say,
I'm kind of impressed by him.

1245
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:53,086
Well, we're expelled.

1246
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:55,623
My life is over and I'm gonna wind up
working at Red Lobster.

1247
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:59,457
- You already work in Red Lobster.
- Yeah, but it's part time, dick.

1248
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:02,122
- Guys.
- Hey, listen.

1249
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:06,658
This is a serious situation.
I mean, I'm kicked out of school.

1250
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:10,571
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
My mom's gonna kill me.

1251
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,869
Come on, she's not gonna kill you.

1252
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:16,275
Yes, she is. I'm the first one
to go to college in my family.

1253
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:21,544
When I left, she said,
"Weensie, if you screw this up, I'll kill you."

1254
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,942
She showed me the knife.

1255
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:27,485
- [Weensie sobbing]
- [Beanie:] Shhh.

1256
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:32,157
Mitch is a lawyer, buddy.
He's gonna take care of this thing, okay?

1257
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,889
It's gonna be all right.

1258
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:39,193
He was supposed to be Luke Skywalker.

1259
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:41,896
Guys, still want to be in the fraternity?

1260
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,966
We've been waiting all semester
for you to ask us that.

1261
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:49,272
Good. I need your help with something.

1262
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:51,973
Off the record.
You do this, you're in.

1263
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:53,480
Sir, yes, sir.

1264
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:57,417
Okay. Walsh, I need you to track down
a copy of University Code 7-A,

1265
01:10:57,486 --> 01:10:59,545
- then fax it to this number immediately.
- Got it.

1266
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:01,954
- I need to talk to you.
- Give me five minutes.

1267
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:04,891
Booker, make two copies of this petition,
have it notarized,

1268
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,520
and then messenger it over
to 34 Langley, and then I need...

1269
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:10,997
Listen, Donald tells me you got these guys
working prep for the arbitration.

1270
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:14,263
I told you five times, I want them working
the Sunshine Square deal.

1271
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:16,930
Well, I locked
the Sunshine Square deal yesterday,

1272
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:19,270
so now I have them helping
with the arbitration,

1273
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:21,969
and I'd appreciate it if you let me
handle my own team,

1274
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:25,138
and don't get on my ass
every time I'm trying to do something.

1275
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,105
All right.

1276
01:11:28,184 --> 01:11:30,175
Wanna make sure
you're on top of it.

1277
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:31,685
Well, I am.

1278
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:33,949
Well, good. Carry on.

1279
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:37,083
See? That's why they call him
the Godfather.

1280
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:37,989
Hey.

1281
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:41,322
Just take care of it.

1282
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:48,265
Gentlemen, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

1283
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:50,202
Did a little research.

1284
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:53,639
What Pritchard did, technically,
is illegal.

1285
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:55,700
We have the right to a formal evaluation

1286
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:58,440
before they can deny
our official application.

1287
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:02,450
However, we're now subject to
a charter certification review

1288
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:03,985
given by the board of trustees.

1289
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,418
Damn it.

1290
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:09,120
Wait. Wait, what does
that mean exactly?

1291
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:13,093
According to university bylaws,
it's a thorough inspection of the fraternity,

1292
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,153
and our contribution to the community.

1293
01:12:15,231 --> 01:12:17,495
Focus is on five categories:

1294
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:20,899
Academics, athletics, community service,

1295
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:23,598
debate, and school spirit.

1296
01:12:23,973 --> 01:12:26,840
Good luck to everybody.
It was nice to know you all.

1297
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:28,809
And I'll see you around campus.

1298
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:31,813
Actually, all of us are
being tested. Yeah.

1299
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:34,873
What are you talking about?
I'm not even in school.

1300
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:38,545
It's in the bylaws. Every member
of the fraternity is subject to review

1301
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:41,089
in every category,
including academics.

1302
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:44,057
Mitch, can you come here a second?
I don't mind popping for breakfast.

1303
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:46,754
I do speakers. I don't do tests.

1304
01:12:47,263 --> 01:12:48,992
This is unbelievable.

1305
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:52,864
What happened to, "needing brotherhood
now more than ever?" They need us.

1306
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:54,994
Come on, college is
overrated anyway.

1307
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:58,301
I built Speaker City from the ground up.
I can barely read. Truth.

1308
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:02,401
This damn thing was your idea,
and you convinced me to do it,

1309
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:04,469
and now people's lives are ruined.

1310
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:06,981
Ruined? Like, whose life is ruined?

1311
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,108
Well, let's see.

1312
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:10,909
Blue's dead.

1313
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:12,954
Frank's divorced.

1314
01:13:13,022 --> 01:13:16,856
I've lost my house.
Nicole thinks I'm a total jackass.

1315
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:21,226
And now we got nine kids who are gonna
get expelled from school,

1316
01:13:21,297 --> 01:13:23,492
and you're not even gonna
help 'em out.

1317
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:41,444
Is this thing gonna go down smooth or
what? I'm missing 18 holes of golf here.

1318
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:44,350
One hundred percent.
I got creative with some of their tests.

1319
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,944
It should make for
a very entertaining day.

1320
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,615
I'm going to enjoy kicking
these assholes off campus.

1321
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:49,555
Ditto.

1322
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:54,986
Welcome, everyone, to the official
debate section of the charter review.

1323
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,565
Unfortunately,

1324
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:02,866
the captain of the university debate
team had a scheduling conflict. Yeah.

1325
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:06,635
So, we had to bring someone else in
to fill in for this event.

1326
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:11,909
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the co-host of CNN's <i>Crossfire,</i>

1327
01:14:11,981 --> 01:14:15,473
famed political consultant,
the Raging Cajun,

1328
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:17,280
Mr. James Carville.

1329
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:19,445
[Applause]

1330
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:23,820
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- Don't clap.

1331
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:27,089
Thank you, Dean Pritchard.
It's an honor and pleasure to be here, sir.

1332
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,289
Topic number one.

1333
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,094
What is your position
on the role of government

1334
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:38,037
in supporting innovation
in the field of biotechnology?

1335
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:41,275
Well, Dean, I'm glad you
asked that question...

1336
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:44,471
I'd like to jump in and take that one,
Jimmy, if you don't mind.

1337
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:47,973
Have at it, hoss.

1338
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:49,984
Why doesn't he wait for an easy one?

1339
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,855
Recent research has shown
the empirical evidence

1340
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:02,556
for globalization of
corporate innovation is very limited.

1341
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:05,794
And as a corollary, the market
for technologies is shrinking.

1342
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:08,359
As a world leader,
it is important for America to provide

1343
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:10,598
systematic research grants
for our scientists.

1344
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:14,609
I believe there will always be a need for us
to have a well-articulated innovation policy

1345
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:17,976
with emphasis on
human resource development. Thank you.

1346
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,009
[Applause]

1347
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:23,713
Where'd that come from?

1348
01:15:23,786 --> 01:15:25,447
What happened? I blacked out.

1349
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,045
It was awesome.

1350
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:29,920
That was interesting.
Thank you very much.

1351
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:33,291
And your rebuttal,

1524
01:26:50,537 --> 01:26:53,768

1525

1526
01:26:57,945 --> 01:27:00,436
Little right. Little more.

1527
01:27:00,981 --> 01:27:03,108
Yeah, that's good enough.
That's good enough.

1528
01:27:03,717 --> 01:27:05,844
- Welcome aboard, Booker.
- Thank you, sir.

1529
01:27:05,919 --> 01:27:08,353
- Walsh. Well done.
- Frank the Tank.

1530
01:27:08,422 --> 01:27:10,287
Why don't you get me
a fresh beer?

1531
01:27:10,357 --> 01:27:11,551
You serious?

1532
01:27:11,625 --> 01:27:12,751
Now!

1533
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:16,426
Now! Hurry, you sorry son-of-a-bitch!

Stay in the goal.

1548
01:28:33,273 --> 01:28:35,707
We gotta stay in the goal.
You can't be walking around.

1549
01:28:35,776 --> 01:28:38,040
You're killing me.
Can we stay between the posts?

1550
01:28:38,111 --> 01:28:41,638
I want focus, I want intensity,
and I want "1,2,3"!

Woofers!

1552
01:28:42,916 --> 01:28:46,818
Go, go, go, eat 'em up!
Hungry! Eat 'em up!

1553
01:28:46,887 --> 01:28:50,983
Caleb, you know what to do in the box.
We talked about it, in the box!

1554
01:28:51,058 --> 01:28:53,026
Chill out, we're up by six.

1555
01:28:53,093 --> 01:28:57,826
That ref's a real prick out there.
That's right, you heard me, my man!

1556
01:28:57,898 --> 01:29:01,698
Number four's been throwing elbows,
and someone's kid's gonna get hurt.

1557
01:29:01,768 --> 01:29:03,167
What?

1558
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:05,068
Let's make it official then, jackass!

1559
01:29:05,138 --> 01:29:06,901
Let's make it official!

1560
01:29:07,774 --> 01:29:10,800
Get the clipboard.
I'll be in the car, all right?

1561
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:12,937
- Have some respect for yourself.
- Thank you.

1562
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,649
Is that Frank the Tank?

1563
01:29:16,717 --> 01:29:18,810
Hey. Heidi.

1564
01:29:19,686 --> 01:29:22,621
- How you doing?
- I'm doing really good.

1565
01:29:22,689 --> 01:29:25,522
I got into body painting.

1566
01:29:25,592 --> 01:29:27,423
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

1567
01:29:27,494 --> 01:29:28,586
That's great.

1568
01:29:28,662 --> 01:29:31,324
Well, you're looking
very healthy.

1569
01:29:31,398 --> 01:29:34,697
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, so are you.

1570
01:29:34,768 --> 01:29:36,702
Oh, thank you.

1571
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:40,137
So, I heard you and Marissa
split up. Is that true?

1572
01:29:40,207 --> 01:29:42,072
Yeah, we did.

1573
01:29:42,809 --> 01:29:44,743
You poor baby.

1574
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:47,104
You know, I'm having
this get-together

1575
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:48,772
at my place
tomorrow night.

Like a few Internet friends.
You should swing by.

1577
01:29:52,753 --> 01:29:54,744
- Really?
- Totally.

1578
01:29:55,589 --> 01:29:57,022
- Okay.
- All right.

1579
01:29:57,090 --> 01:30:00,253
- That sounds awesome.
- See you tomorrow night.

1580
01:30:03,096 --> 01:30:04,427
Awesome.

1581
01:30:04,498 --> 01:30:05,931
Yes!
