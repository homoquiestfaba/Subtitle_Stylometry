1
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:20,912
Hello, lads.

2
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:22,461
Fuck off, old man...

3
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:24,164
Yeah, you old git.

4
00:01:24,302 --> 00:01:25,918
... or I'll smash your head in.

5
00:01:26,013 --> 00:01:27,801
Yeah, give us your
fucking wallet, you cunt.

6
00:01:32,317 --> 00:01:34,310
This lads...

7
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:37,992
is a hurley, used in the
Irish game of hurling...

8
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,572
a cross between
hockey and murder.

9
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:41,577
You fuck-

10
00:01:43,464 --> 00:01:46,300
Why don't l carve my
name in your fucking face!

11
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:48,003
Hold on, hold on.

12
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:49,806
Fucking kill him!

13
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:51,510
Is that
a carpet knife?

14
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:12,017
Jesus wept. I've been looking
for one of these for weeks...

15
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:15,565
but this carpet
just keeps turning up.

16
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,874
A word of advice, girls.

17
00:02:27,885 --> 00:02:30,219
If you're picking
the wrong fight...

18
00:02:30,347 --> 00:02:32,556
at least pick
the right weapon.

19
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:32,337
Now, Sergeant, I'd like
you to tell me once again...

20
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:35,179
about your violent urges.

21
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:39,355
Uh, I must insist
that you extinguish that.

22
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:45,158
And you'll do what, exactly,
if I don't? Arrest me?

23
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:49,036
I'm not sure you realize
the gravity of your situation.

24
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:53,591
Nice pen.

25
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:54,884
Sergeant?

26
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:56,713
Nice pen, I said.

27
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:58,846
Says a lot about you.

28
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:01,602
Oh, is that so?
Pray tell.

29
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:06,236
You like a solid phallic
symbol between your fingers.

30
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:09,915
Sergeant Brant,
in the last year...

31
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:13,538
you've been charged with bugging
the Superintendent's office...

32
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:16,252
beating a felon unconscious
in a billiards hall...

33
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:20,185
and just last week you assaulted
three innocent youths...

34
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:23,516
with a hockey stick.
Shall I go on?

35
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:28,109
My report will be a major factor
in whether you remain in the force.

36
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:35,460
Ser- Sergeant Brant,
sit down.

37
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:43,890
The thing is, Doc...

38
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:49,735
this is the only work l
can do, and if I get bounced...

39
00:04:49,787 --> 00:04:53,329
I'm sure I'll do
something truly reckless.

40
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:05,766
Hi.

41
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:17,710
You got a
minute for me?

42
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:21,012
Yeah. What is it?

43
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:23,301
I don't know.

44
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:27,810
I thought two years undercover on the
Drug Squad would help me out, but...

45
00:05:27,904 --> 00:05:30,397
I don't know.

46
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:33,780
I thought maybe my past
went against me or...

47
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,078
I failed the
Sergeant’s exam.

48
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:38,834
Everyone fails
the first time.

49
00:05:38,926 --> 00:05:41,465
Did you?

50
00:05:41,597 --> 00:05:46,392
Now you've only been out of
rehab a few months. Give it time.

51
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:50,236
Falls, go grab some piss
poor tea in the canteen, okay?

52
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,756
You don't wanna believe what
you read in the papers, sir.

53
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:05,091
It's not what this station needs right now.

54
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:08,646
You know we can't afford
any more bad publicity.

55
00:06:12,157 --> 00:06:15,197
Imagine you walk
down the street...

56
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:18,659
and you bump into three blokes
carrying carpeting knives.

57
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:22,876
Nah, they're not carpet fitters.
They're after your wallet.

58
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,883
Maybe even that gold watch...

59
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:28,094
that you got for the highest
arrest rate in the Southeast.

60
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:32,568
One of the rats there even very kindly
offered to carve their name in your face.

61
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:36,444
Now, would you be more worried about
whether you're gonna have a fight...

62
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,121
than how it looks in the papers?

63
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:45,713
Well, just keep a low profile until
this little shit storm blows over.

64
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:03,086
Business is brisk.

65
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:10,009
Have that, Daniel.

66
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:13,942
I don't think I can
go through with this.

67
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:17,490
You'll be okay. It'll be over in no time.

68
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:19,326
You think I should've
gone for a burial?

69
00:07:19,414 --> 00:07:21,281
No.

70
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:26,174
You'll be glad.

71
00:07:26,261 --> 00:07:29,472
We're ready for you,
Inspector Roberts.

72
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:32,052
Go on.

73
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:38,740
Who got
the flowers?

74
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:41,036
Owner of a stall in
Streatham owed me a favor.

75
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:43,366
Does a clean line
in fruit and veg.

76
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:46,126
It's time.

77
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:54,138
Got some last words, Gov?

78
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:20,865
We'll miss you, love.

79
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,828
Coats and Hammond,
as quick as you can.

80
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:33,173
Let's get you legless.

81
00:08:43,037 --> 00:08:45,200
Where's Fiona?

82
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,532
What?

83
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,961
The urn, Brant.

84
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:51,417
Where the fuck's the urn?

85
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:57,888
Someone must've
nicked that.

86
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,789
One of these guys.

87
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,012
Up, up and away.

88
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,178
We need a detective.

89
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,802
All right.

90
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:52,669
Fuck you, pig.

91
00:10:09,498 --> 00:10:11,786
Brant, are you there?

92
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:12,913
Brant!

93
00:10:13,004 --> 00:10:15,042
What?

94
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:17,501
We need you down at
Smithfield yesterday, Brant.

95
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:19,509
An officer is down.
All hands to the pump...

96
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,719
and don 't go talking
to any fucking journalists.

97
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,346
Sir?

98
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:26,311
I'm throwing you
a bone, Brant!

99
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:29,825
The officer
is Sandra Bates-

100
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:31,996
O h, no. It can't be.

101
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:36,122
The assailant
is armed and dangerous-

102
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,644
That is some dress.

103
00:10:45,735 --> 00:10:47,522
Yeah, well you
look shitty.

104
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:50,533
I've been consoling the
Inspector. His wife passed.

105
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:52,657
Yeah. I heard.

106
00:10:52,748 --> 00:10:57,543
I knew Sandra. We were at
Police College together.

107
00:10:57,633 --> 00:10:59,842
Brant.

108
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:01,512
Was there something?

109
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,091
Sir? There's a witness.

110
00:11:03,186 --> 00:11:06,147
What? Why
wasn't I told?

111
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:09,148
I've been trying to tell you
for the past half an hour.

112
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:11,733
Take his statement.

113
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,715
The dead policewoman
has been identified as...

114
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:27,393
as 26-year-old
Sandra Bates of Camberwell.

115
00:11:27,484 --> 00:11:29,898
Described as a credit
to her force...

116
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:32,276
she was shot
at point blank range...

117
00:11:32,368 --> 00:11:34,156
and died instantly.

118
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:36,582
And now from our
Washington correspondent-

119
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:41,674
It's Tony, right?

120
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:43,469
Anthony.
You're Brant, right?

121
00:11:43,557 --> 00:11:45,299
You know me?

122
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:48,104
Who doesn’t? Last year
at Camberwell billiards...

123
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:51,482
when that nutter come in with a
crowbar, attacked a couple of mates?

124
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:53,281
You rocked up,
beat matey to a pulp.

125
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:54,779
That makes me think
you're a legend.

126
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:57,702
I'm flattered.
They got names?

127
00:11:57,793 --> 00:12:00,127
That's Posh.
That's Becks.

128
00:12:00,214 --> 00:12:01,455
Posh and fucking Becks?

129
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:03,794
You're fucking right.

130
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,970
So run the description
by me again.

131
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,475
Ain't you gonna
take any notes?

132
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:13,154
Do I look
like I carry a pencil?

133
00:12:31,777 --> 00:12:34,111
Morning. I'm
Porter Nash.

134
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:38,993
Superintendent Brown said to talk
to you about getting a locker.

135
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:09,339
Due to the recent
death of his wife...

136
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:12,224
Chief Inspector Roberts
is on extended leave.

137
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:15,233
I'm therefore promoting
Sergeant Porter Nash...

138
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,404
to Acting Inspector...

139
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:18,652
and temporary head
of the inquiry.

140
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:20,076
Sir?

141
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:21,905
Yes?

142
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,459
Shouldn't we promote
one of our own?

143
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:27,461
Now, now gents. I don
't need to remind you...

144
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:30,092
that we're already
the focus of a media circus.

145
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:34,312
Sergeant Nash comes to us from the
prestigious West London branch...

146
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,396
and it is my opinion that he will
instill a level of professionalism...

147
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:41,861
hitherto lacking in our
primitive Southeast Division.

148
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:09,544
I'm coming in.

149
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:13,598
You look like shit.

150
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:15,769
Take that hood
off your head.

151
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,438
I'm in trouble.

152
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,688
You got any beers or anything?

153
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,442
You know I haven't.

154
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:23,491
Sit down.

155
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,367
Talk.

156
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:27,871
Well, me, Macky and Bowes were

157
00:14:27,962 --> 00:14:32,882
What? Looking for a madness?

158
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,306
I think we killed someone.

159
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:37,139
Some camel jockey.

160
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,849
Sorry, I mean
an Indian guy.

161
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:42,939
He weren't moving.

162
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,533
Okay.

163
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:50,541
Okay, I'll look into it.

164
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:52,124
Thank you-

165
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:54,927
Shut up.
I ain't finished yet.

166
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:57,722
If he's dead,
you're on your own.

167
00:14:57,812 --> 00:15:01,775
Yeah? In fact, I’ll come round
your yard and nick you myself.

168
00:15:01,862 --> 00:15:05,905
Now you go home and you
wait till you hear from me.

169
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:10,827
It's choice time, John.
If he lives...

170
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:14,588
you either quit that gang or you quit
coming round here, you understand?

171
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,635
Yeah.

172
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:16,964
Yeah, what?

173
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:21,895
Yes, ma'am.

174
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:27,534
Brant, can l
have a word?

175
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:31,412
I just need to
have a quick chat.

176
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:38,554
So what can l
do for you?

177
00:15:38,642 --> 00:15:41,979
I need a favor.

178
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:47,198
A friend of mine is in trouble.
I need to get him off the hook.

179
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:48,742
Someone you're riding?

180
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:52,542
What?
No, nothing like that.

181
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:54,705
He's a kid.

182
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:57,292
There's a DI. I used to
know him from way back.

183
00:15:57,387 --> 00:15:59,802
We shared a snitch in Brixton.
He'll be able to help.

184
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:00,974
Name?

185
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:03,932
Stokes. Craig Stokes.

186
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:05,358
Thank you.

187
00:16:05,445 --> 00:16:07,608
Now you owe me one.

188
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,843
Harold Dunlop.

189
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,298
I read your stuff
in the papers.

190
00:16:21,392 --> 00:16:23,886
I've got some information
on the police killings.

191
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:26,315
All rig ht.
Hang on.

192
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,958
All right. Fire away.

193
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:36,957
Aw, have some
fucking manners.

194
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:40,294
I'm offering you information.
You don't even say hello.

195
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:42,632
It's a pleasure to make your
acquaintance. Is that better?

196
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:44,844
I detest sarcasm.

197
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:49,855
Maybe I'll start on journalists
when I've finished my cop quota.

198
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,908
Oh, uh, heh...

199
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:55,706
Listen fellow.

200
00:16:55,794 --> 00:16:58,162
You and me got off to
the wrong start, didn't we?

201
00:16:58,257 --> 00:16:59,873
So let's try again now.

202
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:01,756
What's your name?

203
00:17:01,847 --> 00:17:04,091
Oh, Christ. I'm not sure
you're even up to the task.

204
00:17:04,227 --> 00:17:05,809
What task?

205
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:10,068
Reporting from inside
the police killings?

206
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:16,490
Where are you on the food
chain? You got any clout?

207
00:17:16,627 --> 00:17:20,088
Well, I'm a staff writer
in the crime department, yeah.

208
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:24,464
I can make you famous.

209
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:27,348
Yo there, copper!
Remember me?

210
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:28,353
Do you want something?

211
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:29,310
Thing.

212
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,942
What?

213
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:32,817
It's 'something'
not some think. '

214
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:35,402
You should at least
be able to speak properly.

215
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:37,204
Look, get lost mate, yeah?

216
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,910
I've got a question, yeah?
What would you do...

217
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:42,841
if I was
to call you a cunt?

218
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,843
Which do you prefer?
Seven or eight?

219
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:47,391
Eight.

220
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:49,345
Eight it is.

221
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,228
Hang on. What?
Eight what?

222
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:55,775
Eight more coppers
to kill. Bye.

223
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:57,827
What-

224
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,354
Cup of tea
and a biscuit.

225
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:42,541
Are you as black
as you're painted?

226
00:18:42,628 --> 00:18:44,997
Are you as Nancy
as they say?

227
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:48,128
Thing is, Brant, if there's a problem,
I'm gonna need to know about it.

228
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:50,136
There's a problem, all right.

229
00:18:50,227 --> 00:18:52,936
Some sick fuck
is killing policemen...

230
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:55,483
and he's only just started.

231
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,277
I meant between us.

232
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:59,984
I know what you meant.

233
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:05,291
Problem? Not unless you
follow me into public toilets.

234
00:19:05,381 --> 00:19:09,173
So I don't get to be
head boy. Big fucking deal.

235
00:19:09,305 --> 00:19:11,298
Less paperwork for me.

236
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,064
There's nothing, sir.

237
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:16,558
See if you can get me a
possible match of the bullet.

238
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:18,110
Yes, sir.

239
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,204
Just keep it open
for me, for now.

240
00:19:23,332 --> 00:19:28,001
Move your right and take your
fucking left hand up and over.

241
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:32,510
Aw, fuck me.
Not you again, mate.

242
00:19:32,642 --> 00:19:34,350
I'll keep coming back
until you get me a knife.

243
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:36,021
Keep your right hand up. I keep telling ya.

244
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,724
You're getting caught with your left up.

245
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:40,234
No, that's not him.

246
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:46,158
Yeah, please.
That's quite important.

247
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:48,249
Want me to widen
the area for questioning?

248
00:19:48,382 --> 00:19:50,466
Great, yeah.
Great idea.

249
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:52,169
The gun was a
9mm semi-automatic.

250
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:54,006
A SIG or a Glock?

251
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:55,764
I'll go on
to forensics now.

252
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:57,062
No?

253
00:19:57,149 --> 00:19:58,515
I don't fucking know.

254
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,943
I don't know!

255
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,818
I wanna know
the name

256
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,821
of every punk
that you sold

257
00:20:03,913 --> 00:20:06,201
a 9 mil semi-automatic pistol
to in the last few months.

258
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:08,376
He's got his back
turned every time.

259
00:20:08,463 --> 00:20:10,831
He knows where
the cameras are.

260
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:12,042
Don't make me
come back

261
00:20:12,136 --> 00:20:13,548
and give me
the same

262
00:20:13,598 --> 00:20:15,180
fucking silly
answers, all right?

263
00:20:15,268 --> 00:20:17,478
I'll ring you when I've got something.

264
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:19,774
I want the name, address
and fucking postal code.

265
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,353
Sarge, come have
a look at this?

266
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:26,661
We've got no footage of the
killing of the second officer.

267
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:28,615
There must be more.
Keep looking.

268
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:29,919
Sir.

269
00:20:40,776 --> 00:20:42,734
You know what I want...

270
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:44,815
so spill.

271
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,738
Well, I need paying first.

272
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:54,341
What do you have in mind?

273
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,428
Serious.

274
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:58,553
Serious money.

275
00:20:58,645 --> 00:20:59,977
Serious money?

276
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:01,556
Mmm-hmm.

277
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:04,236
What, like the time
of benefit?

278
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:05,208
Yeah.

279
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:10,448
Bony fucker, aren't ya?

280
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:14,756
You don't have the brains
of a chicken, do you?

281
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:21,470
I doubt you have any real
Irish blood in you, Radnor.

282
00:21:21,564 --> 00:21:25,857
Me, I'm a wild streak and a
Celt. Makes me unpredictable.

283
00:21:25,906 --> 00:21:28,821
Them Irish. Did you know
they invented kneecap?

284
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,247
It's a nasty business.

285
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:33,702
They fix you up
as best they can...

286
00:21:33,797 --> 00:21:37,544
but you'll always have a
limp. How does that sound?

287
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:42,261
Radnor the gimp. How does that go
down in your retirement package?

288
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,775
A brandy here, Paul.
And a large scotch.

289
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,707
Here's what we'll do.

290
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:01,549
We'll have a nice stiff drink.
Ought to fire us off.

291
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:07,894
Well, go on, Rad.
Pay the man.

292
00:22:07,947 --> 00:22:10,691
Well, l- I don't
drink brandy.

293
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:18,415
Yeah, keep
the change.

294
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,969
Okay, tell me.

295
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:29,394
There's this bloke
at the Peacock Gym.

296
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,108
He set fire
to a police dog.

297
00:22:32,203 --> 00:22:35,369
YouTubed it. Somebody asked
him why he did it. He said...

298
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:39,339
"Practice."

299
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,917
Well, that's it?

300
00:22:41,012 --> 00:22:42,924
Seriously, he's a nutter.

301
00:22:43,016 --> 00:22:44,928
Fuck, if we pulled in
every wanker who said that...

302
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:46,602
we'd be up to our
arse in suspects.

303
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,147
What's his name?

304
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:50,101
Well, I don't-
I don't- I don't know.

305
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:52,861
But I'm meeting a guy later
who's gonna get it for me.

306
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:56,243
Don't bother. I'll go to
the gym. Ask the manager.

307
00:22:56,333 --> 00:23:00,455
But you see, l-
Don't I get something?

308
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:04,555
I left you the rest of my
crisps, you greedy bugger.

309
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,015
What more do you want?

310
00:23:07,105 --> 00:23:09,223
For fuck's sake.

311
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:11,527
Are you fucking me?

312
00:23:11,614 --> 00:23:15,281
Can I have
my change back, please?

313
00:23:15,371 --> 00:23:18,285
Fuck, I can't walk.

314
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:15,941
Are you as black
as you're painted?

315
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:39,278
Disturbing you,
am l?

316
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:41,987
No, I was just in the middle of eating.

317
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:45,750
Go ahead.
That's your Tex Mex, isn't it?

318
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:52,174
Christ, what is that?

319
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:55,184
Hare Krishna food?

320
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:56,982
Better put some
meat in you, boy.

321
00:24:57,028 --> 00:25:00,194
A big juicy steak.
Get the blood flowing.

322
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:03,199
You know,
the chaps had a word...

323
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:06,251
for this type of
bare look, didn't they?

324
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,707
Minimalist.

325
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,755
Shy is the word
I had in mind.

326
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,763
Can I get a drink, then?

327
00:25:13,854 --> 00:25:16,974
Over there.
Help yourself.

328
00:25:18,654 --> 00:25:22,367
Jesus, no wonder you
stay at home.

329
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:24,696
So what are you having?

330
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:27,877
I've got some
water, thanks.

331
00:25:27,964 --> 00:25:32,554
Can I ask you
why you're here?

332
00:25:32,682 --> 00:25:36,177
I need your advice.

333
00:25:36,272 --> 00:25:40,736
Look, I don't give a fuck
about you being a pillow biter.

334
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:42,986
I don't give a fuck
what people do...

335
00:25:43,077 --> 00:25:45,912
as long as they
keep it to themselves.

336
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:51,716
I respect you
and there's not many I do.

337
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:54,506
What's the problem?

338
00:25:58,608 --> 00:26:00,566
I'm losing it.

339
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:02,779
In what way?

340
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:09,542
I'm blacking out.

341
00:26:09,629 --> 00:26:14,253
Not often, but enough
to be worried.

342
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:19,350
Don't wanna talk, eat.

343
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,152
It's actually a huge effort
to drag myself outta bed.

344
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:29,829
I just stare at the wall.

345
00:26:29,877 --> 00:26:33,122
Just do nothing, you know?

346
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,301
Absolutely nothing.

347
00:26:35,388 --> 00:26:37,255
It's burnout.

348
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,557
What?

349
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:40,762
Your brain's on meltdown.

350
00:26:40,857 --> 00:26:42,440
A couple of days
doing nothing...

351
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:44,109
and you’ll
start to come back.

352
00:26:44,197 --> 00:26:46,189
You sound pretty sure.

353
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:48,448
Yeah, I am sure.
I've been there myself.

354
00:26:48,497 --> 00:26:50,615
You?

355
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,120
Yeah. I could barely
work the microwave.

356
00:26:53,214 --> 00:26:55,298
I was fucked.

357
00:26:55,385 --> 00:26:58,471
We got this pedophile
on the loose in Holland Park.

358
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:01,303
He was luring
children into his car.

359
00:27:01,397 --> 00:27:04,642
We knew who he was but we just
couldn't catch him in the act.

360
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:08,776
These kids were too
traumatized to identify him.

361
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,033
He was this big
showbiz agent, you know.

362
00:27:11,124 --> 00:27:13,539
Major connections.

363
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,337
The guys back
at the nick...

364
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,212
they just about put me
on a par with him...

365
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,170
because I was
a queer, yeah?

366
00:27:19,265 --> 00:27:21,600
Wanked off into condoms and
leave them in my locker...

367
00:27:21,687 --> 00:27:24,932
scratched the car,
sugar in the petrol tank.

368
00:27:25,027 --> 00:27:26,643
All the usual shit.

369
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,866
It put me
under tremendous pressure.

370
00:27:29,954 --> 00:27:32,823
I was knocking back
Valium, shots at breakfast...

371
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,500
two packs a day.

372
00:27:34,587 --> 00:27:37,171
So I thought, fuck it.

373
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,380
I thought I'd take matters
into my own hands.

374
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:43,180
And I broke into the paedophile's
house at 4:00 in the morning...

375
00:27:43,271 --> 00:27:46,016
and I smashed his bollocks
in with a baseball bat...

376
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,105
until they fucking popped.

377
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:51,066
I took a leave
of absence after that.

378
00:27:51,162 --> 00:27:52,870
I was burnt out.

379
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:55,325
Came back here,
I shut the curtains.

380
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:00,510
Pulled the phone out.
Just hid away.

381
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:04,184
I went back to work
expecting the axe...

382
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:07,892
but they ended up
transferring me.

383
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:17,289
Wanker.

384
00:28:36,501 --> 00:28:39,210
Morning.
Want some breakfast?

385
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:42,337
A coffee,
two sugars.

386
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:51,192
You had an affair
with me?

387
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,443
I held back.

388
00:28:53,534 --> 00:28:56,574
So any idea who
we're looking for?

389
00:28:56,665 --> 00:29:00,457
A psycho.
Whistles while he works.

390
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:02,380
Showed up
at Peacock Gym yesterday.

391
00:29:02,426 --> 00:29:04,966
I got the name
of a bloke in Nunhead.

392
00:29:05,056 --> 00:29:06,297
Worth a visit?

393
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,013
You want me along?

394
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:10,142
Sure. See you there
in half an hour.

395
00:29:15,493 --> 00:29:20,208
Oh, yeah. The other thing, about
you being a good cop. I meant that.

396
00:29:20,295 --> 00:29:22,458
Thank you.

397
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:25,885
For a poofter.

398
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:03,617
You replaced me.

399
00:30:03,713 --> 00:30:04,830
You're on compassionate leave.

400
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:06,878
I 'm back.

401
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,012
Inspector Roberts,
losing a wife is not easy.

402
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:12,514
You lost your wife?

403
00:30:12,605 --> 00:30:14,268
Well, no-

404
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:16,443
How would you feel
about early retirement?

405
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,194
We'd miss you, sir.

406
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,243
You know who
else would miss you?

407
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:26,375
Olga, the 250-pound call
girl you see every Wednesday.

408
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:28,835
Your wife thinks
you're playing squash.

409
00:30:28,971 --> 00:30:32,558
Well, you are, in a way.

410
00:30:32,644 --> 00:30:36,607
I don't need a fanfare.
I don't need an office.

411
00:30:36,694 --> 00:30:38,277
I just wanna work.

412
00:30:38,364 --> 00:30:40,026
Well, what are
you waiting for?

413
00:30:40,117 --> 00:30:41,700
Fuck off, Roberts.

414
00:30:41,788 --> 00:30:44,453
Go solve some crimes.

415
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:03,361
Fuck.

416
00:31:05,251 --> 00:31:08,165
Police! Open up!

417
00:31:16,857 --> 00:31:19,727
Oh!

418
00:31:31,343 --> 00:31:33,836
Barry Weiss?

419
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,553
That is me.

420
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,931
Can we come in?

421
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,022
Got a warrant?

422
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:43,446
It's in the post.

423
00:32:04,575 --> 00:32:06,568
Can I get you anything?

424
00:32:06,663 --> 00:32:10,910
How about a cuppa, coppers?

425
00:32:11,004 --> 00:32:12,962
I know you.

426
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,543
If we'd met,
I'm sure I'd remember.

427
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:28,489
You know what that is?

428
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,996
Michael Jackson's shit.

429
00:32:32,129 --> 00:32:34,338
It's priceless.

430
00:32:34,425 --> 00:32:36,463
I got it off eBay.

431
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,515
So what was it you were looking
for? Maybe I could help you.

432
00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:41,514
What do you do, Mr. Weiss?

433
00:32:41,605 --> 00:32:44,691
I'm between jobs.

434
00:32:44,778 --> 00:32:49,322
You like torching
dogs, do ya?

435
00:32:49,413 --> 00:32:51,406
I saw your
home movie.

436
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,663
On YouTube, right?

437
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:56,500
It got over 9,000 hits
before they took it down.

438
00:32:56,594 --> 00:32:59,429
I post
- I posted it, yeah, but I wasn't involved.

439
00:32:59,516 --> 00:33:01,884
Nah, I'm joking.
I love animals, me.

440
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:04,849
What about police, Barry?
You like them?

441
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:07,527
"Thank God," I say.

442
00:33:07,615 --> 00:33:11,783
I say "Thank God
for the men in blue."

443
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:16,338
I remember you now, Barry.

444
00:33:16,424 --> 00:33:19,715
Yeah, you're the piece of
shit from the billiards hall.

445
00:33:23,772 --> 00:33:27,689
Back on your feet,
I see.

446
00:33:29,449 --> 00:33:33,617
Come on, Nash.
Let's get out of here.

447
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,018
What was
all that about?

448
00:33:45,147 --> 00:33:47,687
I had a run in with
him about a year ago.

449
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:49,690
I might have put
him in the hospital.

450
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:51,899
Welcome to the liberal
Southeast.

451
00:33:51,994 --> 00:33:54,203
It gets results.

452
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,499
Let's just keep
an eye on him.

453
00:33:56,586 --> 00:33:59,205
You just wait and see.

454
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,418
Yeah?

455
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:07,099
You wait and see.

456
00:34:09,445 --> 00:34:13,191
What are you fucking
looking at, you fucking perv?

457
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:23,624
Fuck. Ow!

458
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:31,017
Weiss. Nice.

459
00:35:38,327 --> 00:35:41,117
B. Weiss, P-23...

460
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:45,626
Weymouth Parking.
You little bastard.

461
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,033
Who is it?

462
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,739
Satellite TV.

463
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:29,997
I've come for your box.

464
00:37:36,142 --> 00:37:38,476
What's the problem?
I just paid the bill.

465
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:41,687
That's funny...

466
00:37:41,777 --> 00:37:43,440
because you
are the bill.

467
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:45,147
You're not
the usual bloke-

468
00:37:47,371 --> 00:37:48,533
Ugh.

469
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,663
Question two. Which Scottish
music hall comedian-

470
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,288
B! B! B.

471
00:38:54,378 --> 00:38:56,085
A. Jack Milroy

472
00:38:56,174 --> 00:38:59,088
B. Andy Stewart
or C. Sir Harry Lauder?

473
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:02,015
B.

474
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:06,520
Come on, you fucking idiot, B.

475
00:39:30,825 --> 00:39:32,692
Yes.

476
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,156
Sweet.

477
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:03,844
There 's a fire
at Cerinem Point.

478
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:08,053
In a flat on the 16th floor,
you'll find cop number three.

479
00:40:08,148 --> 00:40:10,687
Oh, I used a new system.

480
00:40:10,777 --> 00:40:12,144
A new system?

481
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:14,607
Can you be
a bit clearer?

482
00:40:14,702 --> 00:40:16,695
I pulverized
the fucker with a hammer.

483
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:20,080
Is that clear
enough for you?

484
00:40:22,551 --> 00:40:24,885
I pulverized
the fucker with a hammer.

485
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:26,258
Oh, yeah.

486
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,719
Oh, shit.

487
00:40:28,813 --> 00:40:30,554
Yeah, I forgot.
I got a name.

488
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,768
A name?

489
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,981
Is there an echo? Stop
repeating everything I say.

490
00:40:35,076 --> 00:40:36,317
It's getting
on my fucking tits.

491
00:40:36,411 --> 00:40:37,777
I'm sorry.

492
00:40:37,872 --> 00:40:41,710
It's "Blitz"
as in "Blitzkrieg."

493
00:40:41,797 --> 00:40:43,380
You got that?

494
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:46,337
Yeah. That's good. Yeah.

495
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:49,972
Oh, fuck.

496
00:41:33,022 --> 00:41:34,434
Sarge, you need
to see this.

497
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,893
It's the evening edition.

498
00:41:41,163 --> 00:41:42,404
Bastards!

499
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:49,042
Where the hell
have you been?

500
00:41:49,137 --> 00:41:50,503
Can't say.

501
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,724
What do you mean
you can't say?

502
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:54,519
Can't account
for my movements?

503
00:41:54,648 --> 00:41:56,231
Is that
the correct lingo?

504
00:41:56,318 --> 00:41:58,686
You do know another
policeman’s been killed?

505
00:41:58,781 --> 00:42:00,193
Chief Inspector Roberts.

506
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,322
What?

507
00:42:02,413 --> 00:42:04,952
The killer's targets
are in this station.

508
00:42:05,043 --> 00:42:07,833
He used a hammer to kill
Roberts and he torched his flat.

509
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:10,042
He contacted some hack
journalist at The Post...

510
00:42:10,137 --> 00:42:13,098
called Dunlop. Gave him all the details.

511
00:42:13,184 --> 00:42:15,051
Dunlop you say?

512
00:42:15,147 --> 00:42:17,185
Yeah. Harold Dunlop.
I sent a team over there...

513
00:42:17,276 --> 00:42:19,485
to tap his phone and make
sure his calls are traced.

514
00:42:19,572 --> 00:42:20,733
Do you know him?

515
00:42:20,824 --> 00:42:22,407
I do.

516
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,033
I'm Harold Dunlop
from The Post.

517
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,995
Hey! Get off!

518
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:32,256
All right! All right!
Bloody hell!

519
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:33,554
What was
all that about?

520
00:42:33,683 --> 00:42:35,550
I told you,
I know him.

521
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:38,226
Bastard put my
picture in the paper.

522
00:43:19,856 --> 00:43:21,519
Click.

523
00:43:31,129 --> 00:43:32,837
Hello. Hello. Hello.

524
00:43:38,727 --> 00:43:40,344
Bang. Bang.

525
00:43:45,449 --> 00:43:47,908
Yippity-doo-dah-day.

526
00:43:55,509 --> 00:43:57,297
Hello? Dunlop.

527
00:43:57,388 --> 00:44:00,098
Is this Harold Dunlop?

528
00:44:00,186 --> 00:44:01,849
Yeah. Yeah.

529
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,897
The Harold Dunlop?
The crime reporter?

530
00:44:03,985 --> 00:44:04,975
Can you get me a lattè?

531
00:44:05,071 --> 00:44:06,984
Yeah. Who's this?

532
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:10,662
Mr. Dunlop, how would
you like to nail The Blitz?

533
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:13,033
Yeah, I 'd like
that very much.

534
00:44:13,169 --> 00:44:17,793
Oh-ho! Is that it? Perhaps I didn't
make myself clear, Mr. Dunlop.

535
00:44:17,887 --> 00:44:20,005
I know the name
of the cop killer.

536
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,596
I think you're gonna have to work
a little bit harder than that.

537
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:26,058
It'll be an honor to bring
that maniac to justice.

538
00:44:26,153 --> 00:44:27,519
Yeah. Yeah.

539
00:44:27,614 --> 00:44:29,527
Well, you'll have
a little think...

540
00:44:29,618 --> 00:44:31,953
about how much
you'd be willing to pay.

541
00:44:31,998 --> 00:44:34,286
Come now, Mr. Dunlop.

542
00:44:34,378 --> 00:44:37,919
You didn't think this was a
citizen doing his bit now, did you?

543
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,170
How much do you want?

544
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:41,301
50k. In cash.

545
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:44,512
For that, you get
the name of The Blitz...

546
00:44:44,606 --> 00:44:46,438
plus extras.

547
00:44:46,527 --> 00:44:48,314
Extras?
What do you mean extras?

548
00:44:48,405 --> 00:44:50,865
Various assorted
items, Mr. Dunlop.

549
00:44:50,952 --> 00:44:54,368
You'll find out
when I get my 50k.

550
00:44:59,135 --> 00:45:02,255
I'm the master
of the fucking universe.

551
00:45:08,862 --> 00:45:10,273
Hello.

552
00:45:10,364 --> 00:45:12,653
Hey.

553
00:45:12,745 --> 00:45:18,040
The fire pretty much destroyed
anything around the body.

554
00:45:18,172 --> 00:45:21,667
We found that in the bathroom.
The fire wasn't so bad in there.

555
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:25,012
But did the heat or water
damage any DNA or fingerprints?

556
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:26,889
I'm afraid so.

557
00:45:31,657 --> 00:45:33,615
Peacock Gym.

558
00:45:33,702 --> 00:45:36,412
Yeah, looks like it.

559
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:40,880
It's B rant. Check if DI Roberts
was ever a member of the Peacock Gym.

560
00:45:47,396 --> 00:45:49,354
What are you doing?

561
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:51,479
I told you to wait until you heard from me.

562
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:53,359
Yeah, well,
I didn't hear from you.

563
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:55,112
Yeah.
Well, I'm sorting it.

564
00:45:55,161 --> 00:45:57,745
Yeah? I'm trying to.

565
00:45:57,874 --> 00:46:00,083
Look, just go home.

566
00:46:21,087 --> 00:46:23,205
DI Stokes?

567
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,711
You must be Falls.

568
00:46:24,802 --> 00:46:26,168
Yeah. Yeah.

569
00:46:26,264 --> 00:46:27,675
What'll you have?

570
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:30,978
Tea, please, sir.
Just tea.

571
00:46:31,065 --> 00:46:33,775
Forget the "sir" stuff.
Craig'll do.

572
00:46:33,904 --> 00:46:35,236
Tea and toast
for two!

573
00:46:35,323 --> 00:46:37,111
Coming up, love!

574
00:46:37,202 --> 00:46:39,741
Okay. Well, we've got
two of the kids...

575
00:46:39,832 --> 00:46:41,744
involved in the assault
of Mr. Aziz.

576
00:46:41,835 --> 00:46:42,997
I thought- He's not-?

577
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:45,924
Dead? Incredibly, no.

578
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,595
Let me see.

579
00:46:48,683 --> 00:46:51,553
John Wells,
known as Metal.

580
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,981
This the one
you wanted to discuss?

581
00:46:54,068 --> 00:46:55,149
Yes.

582
00:46:55,237 --> 00:46:57,321
What is he? A snitch?

583
00:46:57,408 --> 00:46:59,366
Yeah, well, you know...

584
00:46:59,453 --> 00:47:03,041
and I try to look out
for him.

585
00:47:03,128 --> 00:47:06,214
Thank you.

586
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,170
He's a piece of shit.

587
00:47:09,265 --> 00:47:10,255
A thug.

588
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,092
Oh, he's a boy.

589
00:47:12,187 --> 00:47:16,058
Underneath all that,
he's just a scared boy.

590
00:47:19,785 --> 00:47:22,073
So is there
anything you can do?

591
00:47:22,165 --> 00:47:24,659
Anything can be buried.

592
00:47:24,754 --> 00:47:27,749
Will you?

593
00:47:27,843 --> 00:47:30,758
Meet me for a drink tonight.

594
00:47:32,268 --> 00:47:33,976
That's all?

595
00:47:43,415 --> 00:47:47,206
Hey, Roberts and the
Peacock Gym. Never a member.

596
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,507
No, of course not.

597
00:47:49,594 --> 00:47:51,210
Have you got a minute?

598
00:47:51,305 --> 00:47:52,512
Yeah.

599
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,512
Can you work that thing?

600
00:47:54,603 --> 00:47:56,641
Brant, you're
such a dinosaur.

601
00:47:56,733 --> 00:48:00,445
I'm surprised you can even
work your own microwave.

602
00:48:00,532 --> 00:48:03,447
This is women's work. Just like typing.

603
00:48:03,538 --> 00:48:05,280
Right.

604
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,037
So what are
you looking for?

605
00:48:07,086 --> 00:48:10,047
Barry Weiss.
It's the Belfront Towers.

606
00:48:10,133 --> 00:48:15,600
Kicked out of Peacock Gym.

607
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:19,353
Oh, wow. This guy's
always in trouble.

608
00:48:19,443 --> 00:48:24,112
He's been arrested more times
than you've had WPC's.

609
00:48:24,203 --> 00:48:25,660
You know I'm
not like that.

610
00:48:25,747 --> 00:48:27,580
Right.

611
00:48:27,668 --> 00:48:31,415
It's petty stuff, though.
What do you think?

612
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:34,048
No, nothing major.

613
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,381
None of that yet.

614
00:48:40,777 --> 00:48:42,519
Have you got my money?

615
00:48:42,615 --> 00:48:44,858
Yeah. I just had to
pull a few strings.

616
00:48:45,036 --> 00:48:48,953
Pick me up outside
Weymouth Street car park.

617
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:04,061
Stand there.

618
00:49:04,156 --> 00:49:05,237
All right.

619
00:49:05,325 --> 00:49:07,785
There. Steady. There.

620
00:49:07,872 --> 00:49:10,240
Oh, Jesus.

621
00:49:21,273 --> 00:49:24,234
Click.

622
00:49:32,963 --> 00:49:35,708
These are the extras
I was talking about.

623
00:49:35,802 --> 00:49:38,968
Trophies, I believe
is the correct term.

624
00:49:39,058 --> 00:49:41,301
And you know
who these belong to, eh?

625
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:43,856
Correct.

626
00:49:47,616 --> 00:49:49,449
Right, I showed
you mine.

627
00:49:49,537 --> 00:49:52,327
Perhaps we could have a
little look at yours now.

628
00:50:18,594 --> 00:50:21,339
All right.

629
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:23,220
Aw.

630
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:24,519
What?

631
00:50:24,606 --> 00:50:25,847
That's not
fifty grand.

632
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,391
Of course
it's fifty grand.

633
00:50:27,487 --> 00:50:28,853
There's no way
that's fifty grand.

634
00:50:28,948 --> 00:50:30,439
When did you
last see fifty grand?

635
00:50:30,534 --> 00:50:32,197
Don't you trust me?
Go and count it.

636
00:50:32,287 --> 00:50:33,368
It's about
500 quid.

637
00:50:33,456 --> 00:50:34,789
Oh. Go on, then.

638
00:50:34,876 --> 00:50:37,540
I'm gonna count
every bit of it.

639
00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:40,129
Good. Buy yourself
a new suit.

640
00:50:45,564 --> 00:50:48,309
Fifty, fifty,
fifty, fifty, fifty.

641
00:50:48,361 --> 00:50:53,359
You are a fucking genius.

642
00:51:04,142 --> 00:51:05,929
I haven't told him
your name yet.

643
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:09,018
Relax. I'm not
gonna hurt you.

644
00:51:09,152 --> 00:51:13,570
I only do police. Remember?

645
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,778
How'd you get on to me?

646
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:21,168
I got your address
from the Peacock Gym...

647
00:51:21,258 --> 00:51:25,301
and I went
through your rubbish.

648
00:51:25,391 --> 00:51:28,636
I found the receipt
for the parking garage.

649
00:51:28,731 --> 00:51:30,519
That's very impressive.

650
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:33,730
I haven't told him
your name yet.

651
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:38,952
I haven't
told him your name.

652
00:51:39,043 --> 00:51:41,662
But you're gonna have to help me out, see?

653
00:51:41,757 --> 00:51:43,294
Ah.

654
00:51:43,386 --> 00:51:46,300
I haven't told him
your name yet.

655
00:51:46,391 --> 00:51:48,601
This is a bit
of a tight squeeze.

656
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:53,898
I haven't told him
your name yet.

657
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:55,481
No, no, no.

658
00:52:37,157 --> 00:52:39,150
A double Irish.

659
00:52:39,286 --> 00:52:41,951
Can't do, buddy.
I'm closed.

660
00:52:46,384 --> 00:52:49,504
Listen up. I'm only gonna say
this once. I ain't your 'buddy.'

661
00:52:49,556 --> 00:52:52,767
When I ask for a drink, you
say, "Ice with that, sir?"

662
00:52:52,854 --> 00:52:55,394
Now let's begin again.
A double Irish.

663
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,073
You want ice
with that, sir?

664
00:53:02,164 --> 00:53:05,250
Don't be ridiculous.
Who needs ice?

665
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:11,596
That’ll be five quid, sir.

666
00:53:11,683 --> 00:53:13,550
Like you said...

667
00:53:13,645 --> 00:53:16,264
you're closed.

668
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:19,862
He went to the toilet.
When he hadn't come back...

669
00:53:19,907 --> 00:53:20,863
I got concerned.
I thought he fell in.

670
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:22,151
He did.

671
00:53:22,288 --> 00:53:23,904
Then what happened?

672
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:26,493
Well, I went in there,
didn't l? I found him.

673
00:53:26,629 --> 00:53:29,874
Well, you didn't exactly come rushing
out though, did you, Mr. Dunlop?

674
00:53:29,969 --> 00:53:32,588
The man at the bar says you
was with him for ten minutes.

675
00:53:32,683 --> 00:53:35,392
Had you down as a couple
of George Michael fans.

676
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,347
Hey, I was looking
for the money.

677
00:53:37,442 --> 00:53:38,854
Money?

678
00:53:38,945 --> 00:53:40,482
The paper's money.

679
00:53:40,573 --> 00:53:41,780
We were paying him
for an exclusive.

680
00:53:41,867 --> 00:53:43,905
Oh, for fuck's sake.

681
00:53:43,997 --> 00:53:45,408
Can I remind you
that people...

682
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,365
are being killed
here, Mr. Dunlop?

683
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,293
Ah, yeah?

684
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,839
Yeah. Human beings,
with families and children.

685
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:53,637
There's a car. Yeah.
Oh, God, I forgot.

686
00:53:53,724 --> 00:53:56,935
Yeah. A car. You're not
gonna believe what's inside.

687
00:53:57,022 --> 00:53:58,889
Where is this car?

688
00:53:58,984 --> 00:54:01,398
Weymouth Street car park.
It's a black Jaguar.

689
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:02,650
Bay 23!

690
00:54:05,873 --> 00:54:08,833
Oi! Am I gonna get
police protection?

691
00:54:08,921 --> 00:54:10,458
Oh, yeah.

692
00:54:10,549 --> 00:54:13,544
We'll be all over you.

693
00:54:13,638 --> 00:54:16,177
Should've been the
other guy had him killed.

694
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:27,411
What now?

695
00:54:35,556 --> 00:54:37,890
Murder inquiry. I want the
disc for the last month.

696
00:54:37,977 --> 00:54:39,264
Discs are full.

697
00:54:39,397 --> 00:54:41,138
What do you mean
they’re full?

698
00:54:41,234 --> 00:54:43,773
They haven't recorded
anything for six weeks.

699
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,982
It ran out of memory.
They'll fix it Monday.

700
00:54:46,076 --> 00:54:48,160
I don't believe this.

701
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:51,618
The cameras are really
turned on. It's psychological.

702
00:54:51,713 --> 00:54:53,876
You don't give
a shit, do ya?

703
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:57,462
It's disgraceful.

704
00:54:57,557 --> 00:55:02,397
So is you eating it.

705
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,617
Hey.

706
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:33,792
You look nice.

707
00:55:33,878 --> 00:55:35,039
Thanks.

708
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,293
Can I take
your coat?

709
00:55:36,426 --> 00:55:38,042
Yeah.

710
00:55:42,437 --> 00:55:44,270
Thank you.

711
00:55:44,357 --> 00:55:46,065
Have a seat.

712
00:56:12,454 --> 00:56:13,992
You've gone quiet.

713
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:16,952
I like
listening to you.

714
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:42,551
Everything all right?

715
00:56:42,638 --> 00:56:44,505
There's got to be
an easier way to do this.

716
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,308
Fuck, Brant.

717
00:56:46,396 --> 00:56:48,514
So how does it feel to
actually need us girls...

718
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:52,988
for more than just cooking
and cleaning and shagging?

719
00:56:53,075 --> 00:56:57,790
I was sorting a way of listing
all Weiss' arresting officers.

720
00:56:57,877 --> 00:57:01,088
I've seemed to pull up the
first one. It's WPC Sandra Bates.

721
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:04,762
You're kidding.

722
00:57:09,649 --> 00:57:11,812
I've had
a really nice time.

723
00:57:11,905 --> 00:57:13,237
Yeah.

724
00:57:17,957 --> 00:57:20,326
I'll call you.

725
00:57:24,094 --> 00:57:27,055
When?

726
00:57:27,142 --> 00:57:30,638
When are you
gonna call me?

727
00:57:30,733 --> 00:57:32,520
Tomorrow.

728
00:57:32,611 --> 00:57:34,444
I'll tell you what.
How about this summer...

729
00:57:34,573 --> 00:57:37,238
we'll do a picnic?

730
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:41,372
Don't you think
I know how this goes?

731
00:57:41,462 --> 00:57:43,455
Man says,
"I'll call you"...

732
00:57:43,591 --> 00:57:45,754
and a woman's waiting
and hoping.

733
00:57:45,845 --> 00:57:47,929
She's a slave
to her mobile...

734
00:57:48,016 --> 00:57:50,681
while he's thinking,
"Well, I'll call her...

735
00:57:50,772 --> 00:57:55,692
tomorrow, some day, Monday. Doesn't
matter. Well, here's a hint, yeah?

736
00:57:55,782 --> 00:57:58,743
It matters.
It matters a lot.

737
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:00,868
Tomorrow. I'll
call you tomorrow.

738
00:58:00,959 --> 00:58:02,416
No, fuck off.

739
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:03,410
Hey!

740
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,893
Jesus. Look who else.

741
00:58:29,181 --> 00:58:31,595
Fuck. That's Roberts.

742
00:58:31,685 --> 00:58:32,971
And Falls.

743
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,565
Shit. How could l
be that stupid?

744
00:58:37,655 --> 00:58:41,743
Send an armed response unit
round to her flat straight away.

745
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:43,196
It's a 19.

746
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:45,660
Come on, Falls.
We're coming.

747
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,214
Oh.

748
00:58:48,301 --> 00:58:50,009
Oh, shit.

749
00:58:50,097 --> 00:58:54,310
I'm stupid.
I'm stupid.

750
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:06,158
What the fuck?

751
00:59:06,253 --> 00:59:07,335
What the fuck?

752
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:18,937
Not-

753
01:00:00,526 --> 01:00:03,817
Doctors have given her a sedative.
She should be out for a while.

754
01:00:03,908 --> 01:00:05,741
Did she get a look
at the attacker?

755
01:00:05,828 --> 01:00:08,367
All she could say for sure
is that he's big and white.

756
01:00:08,458 --> 01:00:10,291
Big and white.

757
01:00:10,379 --> 01:00:13,499
So it's not the black kid
from Different Strokes.

758
01:00:13,593 --> 01:00:16,759
It's Barry Weiss.
I know him.

759
01:00:16,849 --> 01:00:19,309
Should you be
taking her booze?

760
01:00:19,397 --> 01:00:21,481
Well, she
won't notice.

761
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:22,808
Want one?

762
01:00:22,903 --> 01:00:24,770
Yeah.

763
01:00:27,078 --> 01:00:30,039
Is she all right?

764
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,084
Who are you?

765
01:00:32,171 --> 01:00:33,834
DI Craig Stokes.

766
01:00:33,883 --> 01:00:35,465
I heard someone
got killed.

767
01:00:35,553 --> 01:00:37,091
It's not Falls.

768
01:00:37,181 --> 01:00:38,763
Cop killer
took a run at her.

769
01:00:38,852 --> 01:00:40,514
Some kid jumped in,
a hoodie.

770
01:00:40,604 --> 01:00:43,440
He got his ticket punched.

771
01:00:43,527 --> 01:00:45,736
Were you
with Falls this evening?

772
01:00:45,823 --> 01:00:49,570
Yes. We went for a drink
and I dropped her off.

773
01:00:49,706 --> 01:00:51,494
You dropped her
in it, you mean.

774
01:00:51,543 --> 01:00:55,881
Did it not occur to you
to walk her to the door?

775
01:00:55,968 --> 01:00:58,804
What agent.

776
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,151
Taxi!

777
01:01:06,238 --> 01:01:10,781
Can you take me
to Bayswater?

778
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:13,578
It's gonna
cost you, mate.

779
01:01:13,669 --> 01:01:15,126
Hey, Bronski Beat.

780
01:01:15,215 --> 01:01:16,956
Do I look like
the kind of cunt...

781
01:01:17,051 --> 01:01:19,545
who thinks Bayswater is
just around the corner?

782
01:01:27,613 --> 01:01:30,028
Hey, stop here.
Stop here, mate.

783
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,828
There. Dean Court.

784
01:01:36,381 --> 01:01:37,963
All right.

785
01:01:38,051 --> 01:01:39,212
Yeah, all right.

786
01:01:39,303 --> 01:01:40,794
There you go.
Keep it.

787
01:01:45,858 --> 01:01:49,650
1,000 pounds.

788
01:01:49,824 --> 01:01:54,869
And question two. We wanted to
know the post code for Blair Castle.

789
01:01:54,959 --> 01:01:57,418
Don't know how many of you
ever visited Blair Castle.

790
01:02:11,492 --> 01:02:13,610
Is he dead?

791
01:02:13,704 --> 01:02:17,074
What, the little skinhead?

792
01:02:17,169 --> 01:02:20,585
It was a doornail.

793
01:02:32,741 --> 01:02:35,451
What's the story
with you and him?

794
01:02:35,539 --> 01:02:39,661
Him risking
his life for ya.

795
01:02:39,755 --> 01:02:43,593
Oh, I've known him
since he was twelve.

796
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:48,178
He used to live
next door.

797
01:02:48,313 --> 01:02:52,903
When I came out of rehab, he was the
only one around here I wanted to know.

798
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:57,408
He made me tea.

799
01:02:57,498 --> 01:02:59,661
I don't know.
I thought...

800
01:02:59,752 --> 01:03:01,995
I could help him.

801
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:06,555
Oh, my God.

802
01:03:09,313 --> 01:03:12,103
Brant.

803
01:03:44,048 --> 01:03:46,132
He definitely
did a bunk.

804
01:03:46,219 --> 01:03:47,756
Find anything?

805
01:03:47,888 --> 01:03:50,598
Nothing incriminating, no.

806
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:54,724
Used to be a good looking
boy. He let himself go a bit.

807
01:03:57,198 --> 01:03:58,815
Let's go public
with Weiss.

808
01:03:58,952 --> 01:04:00,443
Your call.

809
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:03,248
At least we'll flush
the fucker out.

810
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,135
Police today released
a picture of the suspect...

811
01:04:09,222 --> 01:04:11,761
they would like to question
regarding The Blitz.

812
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:14,312
Yeah! I know him!

813
01:04:14,399 --> 01:04:17,735
I dropped the guy off.
He was fucking psycho.

814
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:30,256
Long time, no see.

815
01:04:30,346 --> 01:04:31,632
Hey.

816
01:04:31,725 --> 01:04:34,560
Jack, this is
Detective Brant.

817
01:04:34,646 --> 01:04:35,762
Hello, mate.

818
01:04:35,858 --> 01:04:37,019
Where's our boy?

819
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:38,692
Room 7.

820
01:04:47,798 --> 01:04:49,084
Go, go, go.

821
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:58,978
Fuck!

822
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:01,438
He's on the move.

823
01:05:01,533 --> 01:05:03,150
Let's go.

824
01:05:43,114 --> 01:05:45,699
Ugh.

825
01:05:45,745 --> 01:05:49,457
We have him on the Great
Western Road.

826
01:05:49,585 --> 01:05:53,002
Head down to Harrow Road. We
'Il put him off at the underpass.

827
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,238
Now running west
on the Westway.

828
01:06:38,431 --> 01:06:41,221
Heading towards Paddington.

829
01:06:47,824 --> 01:06:49,612
Suspect entering
train depot...

830
01:06:49,703 --> 01:06:51,787
north of Paddington.
Brant still in pursuit.

831
01:06:53,794 --> 01:06:54,955
All units
head for train depot...

832
01:06:55,088 --> 01:06:57,001
north of Paddington.

833
01:06:57,092 --> 01:07:00,714
Do not let B rant engage.
Repeat. Do not let Brant engage.

834
01:08:00,425 --> 01:08:02,133
What the fuck-
[thump}

835
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:04,008
Leave it, Brant.

836
01:08:04,141 --> 01:08:06,475
Brant, calm down.
We've got him.

837
01:08:06,562 --> 01:08:07,848
Get the fuck-

838
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:09,806
Fuck!

839
01:08:09,902 --> 01:08:11,986
Get this piece
of shit out of here.

840
01:08:12,072 --> 01:08:13,439
Just calm down.
Calm down.

841
01:08:13,534 --> 01:08:15,527
Move! Now!

842
01:08:15,622 --> 01:08:17,204
We've got him.

843
01:08:17,249 --> 01:08:19,709
We've got him, okay? We've got him.

844
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:33,024
The Metropolitan Police
have just confirmed...

845
01:08:33,156 --> 01:08:36,242
the arrest of Barry Weiss, the prime
suspect in The Blitz killings...

846
01:08:36,371 --> 01:08:39,787
in which three London Police officers
were murdered in cold blood...

847
01:08:39,877 --> 01:08:42,747
after a dramatic chase
through West London-

848
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:46,758
A t the Paddington
train depot.

849
01:08:46,849 --> 01:08:49,719
Police are refusing
to comment any further-

850
01:08:58,622 --> 01:09:00,957
Just selling
records, yeah?

851
01:09:43,795 --> 01:09:46,288
We're going to record this. Okay, Barry?

852
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:58,027
I want a lawyer
and a sandwich.

853
01:09:58,114 --> 01:10:02,579
Oh, and I want to update
my Facebook status.

854
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:04,623
You have exactly
forty-eight hours.

855
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:08,582
In that time, you either
charge my client or release him.

856
01:10:15,064 --> 01:10:21,066
And he'd like a different sandwich.
He says the bread is stale.

857
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,995
Weiss might be crazy
but he's not stupid.

858
01:10:24,081 --> 01:10:26,119
He's covered
his tracks.

859
01:10:26,211 --> 01:10:29,171
The fire at Roberts' flat
destroyed any forensic evidence...

860
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:32,128
we might have had. Even the
Peacock Gym link is tenuous.

861
01:10:32,181 --> 01:10:34,721
Well, he's admitted
the Jag belongs to him.

862
01:10:34,811 --> 01:10:37,054
It's been sitting in a car
park for at least six months.

863
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:39,939
Anyone could've had access
to it. There's no CCTT.

864
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:44,653
I got a hold of the guy with the dogs,
the one that saw the first murder.

865
01:10:44,747 --> 01:10:47,662
Now he's saying he can't
make a positive I D.

866
01:10:47,794 --> 01:10:51,165
All right, de 's too scared. Same
goes for the barman at the Wellesley.

867
01:10:51,302 --> 01:10:52,964
You didn't find
anything at the hotel?

868
01:10:53,055 --> 01:10:54,136
Nothing.

869
01:10:54,224 --> 01:10:55,591
What about Forensics?

870
01:10:55,644 --> 01:10:58,012
Team stripped
it down, but no.

871
01:10:58,106 --> 01:11:00,566
With what we've got, he'll be out
tomorrow laughing his head off.

872
01:11:00,654 --> 01:11:02,191
We need something solid.

873
01:11:02,323 --> 01:11:04,407
We'd better come up
with something quick.

874
01:11:04,452 --> 01:11:07,743
Otherwise, the killer is gonna
hop, skip and jump out of here.

875
01:11:07,834 --> 01:11:10,543
The only thing he's getting
so far is a caution.

876
01:11:33,759 --> 01:11:35,717
All right, Babe?

877
01:11:35,805 --> 01:11:40,179
Yeah. Yeah, no. I've been
away, but...

878
01:11:40,273 --> 01:11:42,561
I'm back now.

879
01:11:42,652 --> 01:11:45,145
Do you want to come
to my party?

880
01:11:45,241 --> 01:11:49,534
Yeah, like old times.

881
01:11:49,625 --> 01:11:52,586
Can you take care
of me?

882
01:11:52,672 --> 01:11:54,585
Sweet.

883
01:11:58,976 --> 01:12:00,262
What's this?

884
01:12:00,395 --> 01:12:03,105
Moonshine.
Irish moonshine.

885
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:04,604
Isn't this
stuff illegal?

886
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,904
I fucking hope so.

887
01:12:06,949 --> 01:12:09,443
You drink this poison and then
you wonder why you get blackouts.

888
01:12:09,538 --> 01:12:12,202
I drink this poison
because I get blackouts.

889
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:13,501
Sláinte.

890
01:12:13,588 --> 01:12:14,954
Cheers.

891
01:12:20,727 --> 01:12:24,314
Say we can't prove anything.
Say Barry Weiss walks.

892
01:12:24,442 --> 01:12:26,400
Where are you
going with this?

893
01:12:26,488 --> 01:12:29,324
Well, you told me once
before about some pedophile.

894
01:12:29,452 --> 01:12:33,574
You couldn't get the bastard
through the regular channels, so...

895
01:12:33,669 --> 01:12:36,288
you took him out yourself.

896
01:12:36,383 --> 01:12:40,049
I thought you were asleep
when I told you that.

897
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:43,135
I'm not gonna continue
this line of talk.

898
01:12:43,187 --> 01:12:45,897
I don't like
where it's going.

899
01:13:01,432 --> 01:13:04,302
Been a busy couple
of days for you, Barry.

900
01:13:04,438 --> 01:13:08,150
Took a ride in a police car.
Got your picture in the paper.

901
01:13:08,236 --> 01:13:12,028
Highlight of your career.

902
01:13:12,119 --> 01:13:15,786
You know, Barry,
if you were smart...

903
01:13:15,877 --> 01:13:18,461
which I know you're not...

904
01:13:18,548 --> 01:13:21,338
you'd admit to what you did...

905
01:13:21,513 --> 01:13:25,726
because I'm gonna tell you now, you'll
be a lot safer in here than out there.

906
01:13:25,813 --> 01:13:28,478
Were they
friends of yours...

907
01:13:28,568 --> 01:13:31,313
those cops
that got killed?

908
01:13:36,876 --> 01:13:40,668
You see...

909
01:13:40,759 --> 01:13:44,095
I know what this
is about, Barry.

910
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:52,274
What did those lads
ever do to you, Barry?

911
01:13:52,365 --> 01:13:56,282
Of course, you knew.
How did you react?

912
01:13:56,373 --> 01:13:58,866
Fuck you, pig.

913
01:13:58,961 --> 01:14:02,001
They call that
resisting arrest.

914
01:14:02,092 --> 01:14:04,962
I call it stupid.

915
01:14:11,068 --> 01:14:13,652
I know I embarrassed you.

916
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,571
Since then you've stewed...

917
01:14:18,666 --> 01:14:22,379
and cooked
and simmered over it.

918
01:14:25,095 --> 01:14:29,719
You should've just let it go.

919
01:14:37,495 --> 01:14:40,080
Personally...

920
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:45,292
I didn't remember until I saw you.
Didn't give it a second thought.

921
01:14:45,386 --> 01:14:49,429
It was so insignificant,
I forgot all about it.

922
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:54,274
We sure all laughed when I played
the surveillance tapes at the station.

923
01:14:54,361 --> 01:14:59,235
We all did.
But that stuff's silly.

924
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,083
Sergeant Brant
to you.

925
01:15:10,643 --> 01:15:13,136
The point is, Barry...

926
01:15:13,232 --> 01:15:15,976
you're nothing.

927
01:15:21,874 --> 01:15:24,413
No one cares.

928
01:15:24,545 --> 01:15:28,007
No one gives a fuck.

929
01:15:31,017 --> 01:15:33,601
Oh, and another thing.

930
01:15:33,688 --> 01:15:37,981
You, The Blitz.

931
01:15:38,072 --> 01:15:40,407
What the fuck is that?

932
01:16:40,027 --> 01:16:41,644
Don't mean to bomb
you out, bro...

933
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:43,234
but there's some major
shit going down.

934
01:16:43,325 --> 01:16:44,783
I'm listening.

935
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:46,407
A cop's ripped off
a dealer.

936
01:16:46,497 --> 01:16:48,160
What?

937
01:16:48,251 --> 01:16:50,335
They're getting
into the products, man.

938
01:16:50,422 --> 01:16:52,380
This dealer is like
serious folks.

939
01:16:52,468 --> 01:16:56,806
You fuck with him and he gets
difficult, even with a woman.

940
01:16:56,893 --> 01:17:00,104
Whoa. Whoa.
Back up a second.

941
01:17:00,191 --> 01:17:02,685
A female cop is ripping off drug dealers?

942
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:06,150
She a sister, too.

943
01:17:06,245 --> 01:17:07,908
This cop
have a name?

944
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:09,911
Yeah. Falls.

945
01:17:13,384 --> 01:17:16,845
Brant. It's Stokes.
Listen, I need your help.

946
01:17:24,197 --> 01:17:25,529
I think she's inside.

947
01:17:30,584 --> 01:17:33,829
You crashed
a party, man.

948
01:17:33,924 --> 01:17:37,215
"You crashed a party?" You fucking
- Get him out!

949
01:17:37,306 --> 01:17:38,764
Come here.

950
01:17:48,578 --> 01:17:51,162
Do you like me?
If you like me-

951
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:57,087
Look at this shit.

952
01:17:57,178 --> 01:18:02,348
If you like me,
you can throw me a party.

953
01:18:03,983 --> 01:18:06,476
What are you doing?
I don't wanna go!

954
01:18:06,571 --> 01:18:09,236
Go back.
He's gonna kill me!

955
01:18:09,327 --> 01:18:12,572
He's gonna kill me!
No! He's gonna kill me!

956
01:18:12,708 --> 01:18:16,078
No!

957
01:18:16,174 --> 01:18:18,086
He's gonna kill me!

958
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,857
What are these?

959
01:18:47,944 --> 01:18:50,734
Thanks. They’ll
bring you down.

960
01:18:50,825 --> 01:18:53,991
The shower did that.

961
01:18:54,081 --> 01:18:57,247
Just take 'em, Falls.

962
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:11,942
I'm messed up,
aren't l?

963
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:17,575
Even when I was
working undercover...

964
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:19,662
I was a cop
pretending to be a junkie.

965
01:19:19,798 --> 01:19:23,385
But really, I'm just a junkie
playing at being a cop.

966
01:19:26,645 --> 01:19:30,233
He's gonna get away
with it, isn't he?

967
01:19:32,573 --> 01:19:35,443
If we can't protect our own,
what good are we, Brant?

968
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:41,249
What good are we?

969
01:20:07,851 --> 01:20:09,935
A lot
of press waiting?

970
01:20:10,063 --> 01:20:13,524
Yes, I'm afraid so. There's quiet
a crowd gathered outside the front.

971
01:20:13,613 --> 01:20:16,698
But we can leave through a
different exit, if you prefer.

972
01:20:16,744 --> 01:20:18,360
Fuck no!

973
01:20:18,455 --> 01:20:21,165
I hope it's all there.

974
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:37,071
Is something
on your mind, Barry?

975
01:20:37,158 --> 01:20:41,405
Well, I guess I'll
see you another day.

976
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,584
I can't wait.

977
01:21:16,736 --> 01:21:20,232
Don't worry. We're having
him tailed around the clock.

978
01:21:20,285 --> 01:21:22,151
Keep him
out of trouble.

979
01:21:43,246 --> 01:21:46,491
We're in position now.
He's going into his flat.

980
01:22:10,758 --> 01:22:12,591
Is Brant still here?

981
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:14,512
No. No, he left.

982
01:22:14,599 --> 01:22:16,683
It's Roberts' funeral
this afternoon.

983
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:19,309
Every cop in the Southeast
is gonna be there.

984
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,233
Except you.

985
01:22:50,044 --> 01:22:53,289
In company with Christ
who died and now lives...

986
01:22:53,383 --> 01:22:55,216
may the rejoicing
in Your Kingdom...

987
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:58,049
where all our tears
are wiped away...

988
01:22:58,143 --> 01:23:01,638
unite us together again
in one family...

989
01:23:01,733 --> 01:23:04,273
to sing Your praise
forever and ever.

990
01:23:04,364 --> 01:23:06,402
Amen.

991
01:23:11,293 --> 01:23:14,333
Eternal rest grant
unto him, Oh, Lord...

992
01:23:14,424 --> 01:23:18,421
and let perpetual light
shine upon him.

993
01:23:22,107 --> 01:23:25,147
into Your hand,
Father of Mercy...

994
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:29,235
we commend our brother
in sure and certain hope...

995
01:23:29,287 --> 01:23:31,826
that together, all who
have died in Christ...

996
01:23:31,917 --> 01:23:35,037
will live with Him one day.

997
01:23:35,132 --> 01:23:38,754
In nomine Patris, Filii
et Spiritu Sancti. Amen.

998
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:52,413
Beloved Bruce Roberts, we
give your body to the earth.

999
01:23:52,499 --> 01:23:55,084
Earth Mother,
Root Mother...

1000
01:23:55,172 --> 01:23:57,210
Father of soil.

1001
01:23:57,301 --> 01:24:01,799
We give You this body
of our beloved Bruce Roberts.

1002
01:24:01,893 --> 01:24:04,683
His eyes will never
greet us again.

1003
01:24:04,774 --> 01:24:06,892
Return to earth.

1004
01:24:06,986 --> 01:24:09,696
We will not kiss these lops.

1005
01:24:09,784 --> 01:24:11,777
Return to earth.

1006
01:24:22,517 --> 01:24:25,181
What he has been is gone.

1007
01:24:25,272 --> 01:24:27,981
What he is now
has passed the gate...

1008
01:24:28,152 --> 01:24:31,648
leaving his body
to become soil.

1009
01:24:31,743 --> 01:24:34,236
This flesh
to nurture flowers...

1010
01:24:34,331 --> 01:24:38,248
these bones
to be roots of trees.

1011
01:25:30,901 --> 01:25:32,859
Come on.

1012
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:06,884
Yeah, what's the latest?

1013
01:26:06,971 --> 01:26:09,386
Weiss hasn't left
his flat all day.

1014
01:26:16,657 --> 01:26:17,989
Fuck.

1015
01:28:20,775 --> 01:28:23,986
Brant! Turn around,
you fucker!

1016
01:28:24,073 --> 01:28:26,692
I wanna see your face
as your head explodes.

1017
01:28:34,218 --> 01:28:36,461
Ugh. Agh.

1018
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:44,443
What? You think
you fooled me?

1019
01:28:44,530 --> 01:28:49,198
No chance. I was
just playing along.

1020
01:28:49,332 --> 01:28:50,493
Ugh!

1021
01:28:55,509 --> 01:28:57,628
Ugh!

1022
01:29:04,194 --> 01:29:06,187
Come on, Barry.

1023
01:29:06,281 --> 01:29:07,818
What are you
gonna do?

1024
01:29:10,915 --> 01:29:13,455
Huh? Call
the cops?

1025
01:29:25,986 --> 01:29:29,858
You stupid fucking pig.

1026
01:29:29,953 --> 01:29:33,619
Wait till the papers
get a load of this, hey.

1027
01:29:33,710 --> 01:29:35,703
I'm gonna sue you.

1028
01:29:35,797 --> 01:29:37,164
And you.

1029
01:29:37,259 --> 01:29:40,754
And all of you
fucking pig cunts.

1030
01:29:40,849 --> 01:29:44,219
I'm gonna make
fucking millions.

1031
01:29:46,986 --> 01:29:48,728
You fucking-

1032
01:29:48,823 --> 01:29:50,485
Brant?

1033
01:29:54,793 --> 01:29:56,877
You fuck.

1034
01:29:56,964 --> 01:29:59,298
You can't kill me.

1035
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:02,217
I'm The Blitz.

1036
01:30:02,266 --> 01:30:04,930
Are you talking
about that cop killer?

1037
01:30:05,021 --> 01:30:07,936
That can't be you, Barry.

1038
01:30:08,027 --> 01:30:11,444
We tried to convict you
but you were innocent.

1039
01:30:11,576 --> 01:30:15,744
The only thing we do know is he
was partial to people in uniform...

1040
01:30:15,834 --> 01:30:18,578
just like the one
you're wearing.

1041
01:30:18,672 --> 01:30:22,544
And he used a weapon
just like this one.

1042
01:30:49,692 --> 01:30:52,732
Fucking lucky he didn't
shoot me in the head.

1043
01:31:06,726 --> 01:31:10,267
Something tells me this
one's gonna remain unsolved.

1044
01:31:15,284 --> 01:31:17,777
You're not supposed
to smoke in here.

1045
01:31:17,872 --> 01:31:19,990
What you gonna do?

1046
01:31:20,085 --> 01:31:21,792
Shoot me?

1047
01:31:24,344 --> 01:31:27,965
I'm just leaving
the office now, darling.

1048
01:31:28,059 --> 01:31:30,804
Yeah, I'll be back at 7:00.
I love you too, Amanda. Yeah.

1049
01:31:32,568 --> 01:31:35,186
There he is.
There's Brecky.

1050
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:36,317
Fuck.

1051
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:38,025
Bon appétit.

1052
01:31:40,918 --> 01:31:42,830
Get out! Get away!
