1
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,194
<i>Today is my birthday.</i>

2
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,996
<i>And for the first time in 20 years,</i>
<i>I am not alone.</i>

3
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,836
<i>You see, I met someone.</i>

4
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,356
<i>A man.</i>

5
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,196
<i>A killer.</i>

6
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,833
<i>And soon he will kill</i> me.

7
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,600
<i>It was supposed to be a holiday.</i>

8
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,679
<i>A trip to San Francisco to paint.</i>

9
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,556
<i>To rest.</i>

10
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,355
<i>I had to return to Vancouver</i>
<i>that very morning but I changed my mind.</i>

11
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,112
<i>That simple decision has sealed my fate.</i>

12
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,075
(gunshot)

13
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,475
(gunshot)

14
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,513
(gasps)

15
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,276
Don't, please!

16
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,316
Please. Whatever they paid you...

17
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,550
...I can give you more.

18
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,070
Everything I have! Please!

19
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,915
For the love of God! Have mercy!

20
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,156
(explosion)

21
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,710
My name... is Yo.

22
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,760
<i>Twenty years since my parents died.</i>

23
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,075
<i>Twenty years I've been alone.</i>

24
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,591
<i>I suppose I paint</i>
<i>what I'm afraid to wish for.</i>

25
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,076
<i>He is called the Freeman.</i>

26
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,354
<i>And now... he will free</i> me.

27
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,274
- Thank you.
- Go right through.

28
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,560
- Hello.
- Hello. Open your case, please.

29
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,879
Of course.

30
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,916
(Tannoy announcement)

31
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,032
Here you go, sir.

32
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,993
- What is this?
- Clay.

33
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,353
Clay? You're bringing clay
into the country?

34
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,953
I'm a potter.

35
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,239
Good pots are made from good clay
and a good potter makes his own.

36
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,515
The trick is to find the right mud.

37
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,273
I dry it, lump it into small pieces...

38
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,555
...and carefully sift it.

39
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,837
The object, <i>obviously,</i>
is to increase the claytal quality...

40
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,310
...so you end up with good plasticity
and a high refraction.

41
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,597
I've heard some people store their clay
for up to 20 years.

42
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,637
Miss, will I be breaking that record
at this counter?

43
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,632
- Is there a problem here?
- No.

44
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,551
Not at all.

45
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,596
Thank you.

46
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,356
(cocks gun)

47
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,677
Still using a different gun for each job?

48
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,997
Such a waste.

49
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,358
I'm going back.

50
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,235
Back where?

51
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,959
Go ahead. Pull the trigger.

52
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,150
I'm going home.

53
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,677
You <i>have</i> no home.

54
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,077
Pull it.

55
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,636
(gun clicks)

56
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,717
The Dragons were very happy
with the San Francisco killing.

57
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,352
The son is dead.

58
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,116
<i>But the father is an old lion</i>
<i>and he still dreams of conquest.</i>

59
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,189
<i>Shimazaki can still bite.</i>

60
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,910
<i>Now he is here, in Vancouver.</i>

61
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,798
<i>Exactly where we want him to be.</i>

62
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,239
- Looking for me, chief?
- Yeah. Detective Netah, Detective Forge.

63
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,834
Detective Netah's with Interpol.
He's your new boss.

64
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,275
You'll find out the rest
along with everyone else.

65
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,078
See you in there.

66
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,553
Gentlemen. Gentlemen! Thank you.

67
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,553
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr Shimazaki of the Hakushin Society.

68
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,277
Now, Mr Shimazaki is here
as a Japanese citizen...

69
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,558
...who, as he puts it, wishes to avoid
any unnecessary bloodshed.

70
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,632
I'd also like to introduce you
to Detective Netah from Tokyo.

71
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,349
He's here as a kind of,
let's say, cultural liaison.

72
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,230
It's thanks to him that we can discuss
this situation with Mr Shimazaki today.

73
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,916
I am Shimazaki...

74
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,074
...Lord of 26,000 subjects
and leader of the Hakushin Society.

75
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,670
On August 4th, in San Francisco...

76
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,916
...my son died.

77
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,074
Unworthy death
at the hand of an assassin.

78
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,713
A woman who lives in your city
witnessed the murder.

79
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,758
Her name is Emu O'Hara.

80
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,878
The assassin will come to kill her.
You will not interfere.

81
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,793
We give him the woman
or else he calls out his gangs.

82
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,711
It's gonna be a goddam bloodbath.

83
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,236
(cop 1) He wants us to leave the broad
wide open. It's a fucking setup!

84
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,673
(cop 2) That's out of line!

85
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,112
(cop 3) Come on, we're cops.
Do you wanna get involved?

86
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,714
- (cop 3) We're here to serve <i>and</i> attack.
- (whispers) Now.

87
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,358
(cop 3) What kind of bullshit <i>is</i> this?

88
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,035
(cop 2) Look, we're obviously
in a very tricky political situation here.

89
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,917
(cop 2) We gotta keep our cool.

90
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,515
The man who murdered my son
is here in your city.

91
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,750
He is here to kill the witness...

92
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,628
...simply because she saw his face.

93
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,476
This is his code.

94
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,154
Code? What kind of killer is he?

95
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,755
He belongs to
an ancient Chinese warrior cult...

96
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,593
...called The Sons of the Dragons.

97
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,671
He is their executioner.

98
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,309
<i>(Shimazaki) A single man, very powerful.</i>

99
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,834
<i>They need no other.</i>

100
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,993
Christ! Sounds like a fucking video game!

101
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,072
Next thing, we'll be playing
<i>Dungeons and Dragons.</i>

102
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,311
Uh-uh.
<i>Attack of the Yakuza Killers from Mars.</i>

103
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,631
- It's a bestseller. My kid's got it.
- OK, come on, come on!

104
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,790
Mr Shimazaki doesn't joke, gentlemen.

105
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,078
The roots of The Sons of the Dragons
are very old and run very deep.

106
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,393
Fourteen centuries ago, the Manchus
overthrew the Chinese emperor...

107
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,153
...and instituted the reign of terror.

108
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,630
108 militant Buddhist monks
mounted a revolt.

109
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,315
The Manchus destroyed
all but five of the monks.

110
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,598
These five founded
the society of The Sons of the Dragons.

111
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,989
They became the guardian
of the Chinese people...

112
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,311
...struggling against
injustice and oppression.

113
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,710
<i>(Netah)</i>
<i>They have one killer... the Freeman.</i>

114
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,950
<i>Legend has it that the Dragon</i>
<i>breathes within this man...</i>

115
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,996
<i>... that he cannot die.</i>

116
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,036
<i>His bodies change.</i>

117
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,352
<i>He could be Chinese, American,</i>
<i>Japanese. Any colour, any race.</i>

118
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,319
<i>But he is always the Dragon,</i>
<i>always the same man. A superkiller.</i>

119
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,919
<i>Part fact...</i>

120
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,791
...part wishful thinking?

121
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,233
Who knows?

122
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,349
The Sons of the Dragons exist!

123
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,396
So does the Freeman.

124
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,755
They are fanatics, criminals!

125
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,680
You have 48 hours to find him.

126
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,399
After that, well...

127
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,916
You have been warned.

128
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,316
(cocks gun)

129
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,919
(cocks gun)

130
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,276
(all gasp)

131
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,949
(echoing shouts)

132
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,991
(shouts order)

133
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,394
(gunshots)

134
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,708
(scream)

135
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,631
Aagghh!

136
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,196
(distant gunfire)

137
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,236
(shouts)

138
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,509
(explosion)

139
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,794
Stay here.

140
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,270
(distant shouting)

141
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,636
Shit! Move out of the way!

142
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,759
(screams in pain)

143
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,356
(men groan)

144
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,200
- (brakes squeal)
- (horn blares)

145
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,236
(shouting)

146
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,113
- (echoing shouts)
- (brakes screech)

147
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,591
- Watch out!
- (brakes squeal)

148
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,151
Yo.

149
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,957
(sirens)

150
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,112
The Yakuza will think twice
before they return to China.

151
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,839
The murderers are dead. Both of them.

152
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,990
We have our revenge.

153
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,675
It is as it should be.

154
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,670
Do it quickly. Without thought.

155
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,316
(door closes)

156
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,595
Look, I really don't know anything.
I can't help you.

157
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,636
- It all happened...
- So fast. Yes, I know.

158
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,917
She doesn't seem
to know much of <i>anything.</i>

159
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,834
How about we got over her deposition
to the San Francisco police once more?

160
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,435
But nothing in this deposition
indicates that she ever <i>mentioned</i> Yo!

161
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,115
But that's what she said
when she saw him today.

162
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,718
Do you think she withheld critical
information from the police, Forge?

163
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,075
If she has, it's a serious charge, Detective.

164
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,032
Yo.

165
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,356
Is this a Japanese name?

166
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,031
Is he Japanese?

167
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,630
Fine. You're free to go.

168
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,517
(softly) But you see...

169
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,870
...you should understand, Miss O'Hara...

170
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,112
...that this Mr Yo is going to be a lot
less gentle with you than I have been.

171
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,359
You'd better talk to me, Miss O'Hara.

172
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,076
Or you'll end up dead.

173
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,752
Miss O'Hara, wait. One moment, please.

174
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,229
Shimazaki gave us an ultimatum.

175
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,278
The Yakuza want revenge.
They want this killer.

176
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,751
And unless we deliver him in 40 hours,
there's gonna be a gang war.

177
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,274
The city's gonna become a battlefield.

178
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,035
Lot of people are gonna die.

179
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,036
I'm sorry, Detective...

180
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,111
...I wanna go home.

181
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,431
(sighs) Yeah.

182
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,431
Did you know, Miss O'Hara...

183
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,071
...that in China,
when a murderer introduces himself...

184
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,230
...it means he will kill you?

185
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,634
Miss O'Hara, wait. We'll drive you home.

186
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,756
(Netah) Miss O'Hara.

187
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,355
You better have an official warrant
if you intend to come into my house.

188
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,319
Some people don't need a warrant,
<i>do</i> they, Miss O'Hara?

189
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,356
They get an invitation.

190
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,196
Miss O'Hara,
we don't wanna disturb you...

191
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,078
...but if you would like, we can check out
the house to make sure it's safe.

192
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,596
- No.
- Then please wait. Please take this.

193
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,038
It's an alarm. If anything should go wrong,
you just press the button...

194
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,350
...and we'll be in the house in 20 seconds.

195
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,635
Take it. Just in case.

196
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,236
<i>Detective Forge assured me that</i>
<i>the police would be outside all night.</i>

197
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,915
<i>I didn't want them in the house.</i>

198
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,230
<i>My parents had died there.</i>

199
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,958
<i>The police had been outside</i>
that <i>night, too.</i>

200
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,510
- (Forge) But I'm sure he...
- I'm sorry, Detective Forge...

201
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
...you can't help me.

202
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,556
And I can't help <i>you.</i>

203
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,392
Good night.

204
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,951
<i>Forge knew all about my father, the judge.</i>

205
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,235
<i>About his crusade against the Mafia.</i>

206
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,274
<i>But did she know</i>
<i>the guilt I carry for his death?</i>

207
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,236
Mr Yo.

208
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,956
Out kind of late...

209
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,598
...aren't you?

210
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,636
I work nights.

211
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,269
There are two kinds of people
who work nights.

212
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,839
Really? I never would have taken you
for that kind.

213
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,673
It's time for you to go home.

214
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,718
It's a very dangerous part of town tonight.

215
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,236
I wouldn't like you to get hurt.

216
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,354
Thanks for the advice.

217
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,396
I could use some.

218
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,277
Forge, come in, Forge.

219
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,996
Forge. Come in.

220
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,552
Forge?

221
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,477
<i>(Emu O'Hara) I always thought that...</i>

222
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,632
...death would be cold.

223
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,517
And awful.

224
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,757
Not like you.

225
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,237
(whispers) Please, I...

226
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,235
I wanted you to come back.

227
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,233
Wake up.

228
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,276
Wake up, wake up, sleepy.

229
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,394
- Quite a long time.
- Ryuji.

230
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,711
You lucky it's me, Netah.

231
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,558
Anyone else...

232
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,953
You didn't kill my man, did you, Ryuji?
I wouldn't like to have to arrest you.

233
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,676
We don't kill cops.

234
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,956
Unless they belong to us.

235
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,919
- Like you, my friend.
- Cut to the chase, please.

236
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,037
I don't like chasing. Or waiting.

237
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,315
We want the woman.

238
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,232
No way in hell. We had a deal.
You're out of it for 48 hours.

239
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,392
You back off, Ryuji. Now.
You don't make Shimazaki a liar.

240
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,119
You think I give a shit about your deal?

241
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,159
Why would you? Clan door's wide open
for a power play, huh, Ryuji?

242
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,439
That's right, Netah. I will be the boss
in exchange for the Freeman's head.

243
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,872
And Shimazaki's son in San Francisco,
did you hand him that, too, Blade?

244
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,796
- How did the Dragons find him?
- Netah, we put you where you are.

245
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,476
Don't forget it!

246
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,390
Hey, all you have to do
is look the other way.

247
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,439
We give her some truth serum.
She sings an <i>opera.</i>

248
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,036
You forget one thing, Blade,
you're not in Japan here!

249
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,317
- (thud)
- (groans) Dirty bastard.

250
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,356
(loud thud)

251
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,276
(Emu sighs)

252
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,553
(moans)

253
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,358
Li onna ja ne, ka?

254
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,039
Hoshii, na.

255
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,633
(groans)

256
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,312
(shouts)

257
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,876
You are the Freeman.

258
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,712
(shouts)

259
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,993
(shouts)

260
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,317
(screams)

261
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,994
The weapon you're holding
was meant for <i>her.</i>

262
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,471
(whispers command in Cantonese)

263
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,029
(repeats command)

264
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,159
<i>Kill. You will kill on command.</i>

265
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,756
<i>Kill. You will kill on command.</i>

266
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,074
(whimpers)

267
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,476
(whispers) No.

268
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,636
(coughs lightly)

269
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,316
(strains)

270
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,436

271
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,112

272
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,236

273
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,276

274
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,029
(speaks Cantonese)

275
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,953
She's not a criminal!
She has not offended us.

276
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,316
She knows who you are
and you are <i>forgetting</i> who you are!

277
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,709
Kill her. Throw her out.

278
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,150
I won't report this to the family.

279
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,160
The hospital, Koh. Now!

280
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,558
If you look for me,
if you ever want to find me...

281
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,634
...remember the name Hinomura.

282
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,314
- To hell with this, Freeman!
- Please, Koh!

283
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,992
Don't.

284
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,956
Hinomura.

285
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,994
(Emu) I'm so cold.

286
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,358
<i>Three days later, I awoke in the hospital.</i>

287
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,791
<i>My father died here.</i>

288
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,634
<i>Before I had a chance</i>
<i>to ask his forgiveness.</i>

289
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,239
<i>I had left the house that night,</i>
<i>sneaking out on a dare.</i>

290
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,234
<i>I turned off the alarm</i>
<i>and left the door open.</i>

291
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,752
<i>That was how my father's killer got in.</i>

292
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,715
<i>It was Mery</i>
<i>who brought me here to see him.</i>

293
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,995
<i>And now Mery has come to see</i> me.

294
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,275
<i>The circle has closed.</i>

295
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,875
- (whispers) Mery.
- Goodness, Emu, you... He...

296
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,679
Sshh. (whispers) Speak softly.

297
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,356
I don't want them to hear.

298
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,510
Mery... I need your help.

299
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,955
- (door opens)
- Sshh.

300
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,830
Yeah, chief, I'll call you later.

301
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,957
I thought Miss O'Hara
wasn't up to having visitors.

302
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,679
Visitors, yes. Interrogations, no.

303
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,309
Ease up on her, Netah.
She almost bled to death.

304
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,110
Miss, these need water. Could you tell me
where the washroom is, please?

305
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,509
- It's around the corner.
- Thank you.

306
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,716
She wanted him to kill her.

307
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,475
You didn't catch that, did you?

308
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,711
(sighs) Kill her. Mm. Sure(!)

309
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,595
Inspector Netah.

310
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,632
Thanks.

311
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,675
Hello. Netah here.

312
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,430
Hello. Hello?

313
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,478
Who is it?

314
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,228
- Anything to report?
- No.

315
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,999
Jesus!

316
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,390
- Where d'you think she's going?
- How the fuck do I know?

317
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,316

<i>(man speaks Cantonese over speaker)</i>

319
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,434
How long have you been connected
to the Shimazaki clan?

320
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,717
You're way out of your league, Forge.
Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

321
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,758
No, <i>you</i> enjoy the ride,
cos it's gonna be your last one.

Forge!

326
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,391
Forge.

327
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,232
Take my hand.

Look at me!

00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,919
I have a message for your protectors.

347
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,516
The <i>Dragon!</i>

348
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,991
Listen... I am... Hanada Ryuji...

349
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,237
...boss of the Hanada clan.

350
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,752
I declare war on the Dragons.

00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,236
I want the Freeman.

352
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,349
Or... I will return to China.

353
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,758
(screams)

354
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,996
(old man wails)

355
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,510
<i>I had travelled three days among people</i>
<i>whose language I could not understand.</i>

356
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,160
- (bird's wings flap)
<i>- I had spoken to no-one.</i>

357
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,633
<i>Yet for all this time, I felt eyes on me.</i>

358
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,431
<i>Someone watching.</i>

359
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,318
<i>Some kind of danger lurking close by.</i>

360
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,996
(cackles)

361
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,913
My father was a famous Japanese potter.

362
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,636
He taught you, didn't he?

363
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,351
Yes.

364
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,236
Then he taught me to see.

365
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,632
Look.

366
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,037
On this spot here.

367
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,116
That gives it its shape.

368
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,676
And there...

369
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,716
...the shadow places.

370
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,479
The darkness...

371
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,199
Is as necessary as the light.

372
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,759
Yes.

373
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,070
I am no more an artist.

374
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,712
My name, my profession...

375
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,076
...everything is just a cover.

376
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,556
Who would ever guess...

377
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,633
...that the executioner
for the Sons of the Dragon...

378
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,075
...was just a simple potter?

379
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,434
<i>Seven years ago was my first exhibition.</i>

380
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,277
<i>The reviews of my work</i>
<i>were almost entirely raves.</i>

381
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,113
<i>This work was my 15 minutes of fame...</i>

382
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,397
<i>... and I was going to enjoy</i>
<i>every second of it.</i>

383
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,916
(chatter)

384
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,434
(groans)

385
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,668
<i>Things can change</i>
<i>so quickly in one's life.</i>

386
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,394
<i>So quickly</i>
<i>that the past slips away like a dream.</i>

387
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,870
<i>I went back.</i>

388
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,713
<i>Part of me wanted to look the other way.</i>

389
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,834
<i>But another part wanted to look further.</i>

390
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,470
<i>There was no connection between me and</i>
<i>this man, but he looked straight at me.</i>

391
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,715
<i>A dead man's eyes are a curse</i>
<i>to those who behold them.</i>

392
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,513
<i>I wanted to see into that darkness.</i>

393
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,310
<i>I wanted to know it.</i>

394
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,951
<i>What had I stumbled into?</i>

395
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,395
<i>The picture showed</i>
<i>the two killers I'd seen in the gallery.</i>

396
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,357
<i>They were torturing someone...</i>

397
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,830
<i>... a man whose body</i>
<i>was covered with a magnificent tattoo.</i>

398
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,510
<i>I couldn't have known then</i>
<i>what that tattoo would mean to me.</i>

399
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,912
<i>I decided to go home immediately.</i>

400
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,754
<i>I would mail the film to the police</i>
<i>from the airport.</i>

401
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,236
(gasps)

402
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,953
(grunts)

403
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,032
(gasps)

404
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,076

405
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,156
(metallic creaking)

406
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,236
(inhales sharply)

407
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,315
(gasps)

408
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,628
(whimpers)

409
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,912
(shouts)

410
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,150
(screams)

411
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,871
(whispers command in Cantonese)

412
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:52,990
(repeats command)

413
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,877
Kill. Kill!

414
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,072
You will kill on command.

415
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,191
(slow, strong heartbeat)

416
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,039
(Yo screams)

417
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,312
(gasps)

418
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,356
(breathes heavily)

419
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,636
(thunder)

420
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,637
<i>I was back in my hotel room.</i>

421
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,916
<i>My neck hurt like hell.</i>

422
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,151
<i>But what had happened?</i>

423
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,596
<i>Why had I been kidnapped?</i>

424
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,671
<i>Had</i> I been kidnapped?

425
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,755
<i>All I knew was that I wanted</i>
<i>to get back home as fast as possible.</i>

426
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,836
(phone rings)

427
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,514
- Hello?
<i>- (old woman whispers command)</i>

428
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:00,076
<i>(repeats command)</i>

429
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,993
<i>Open your suitcase.</i>

430
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,592
<i>Now!</i>

431
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,150
<i>His name is Antonio Rossi.</i>

432
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,675
<i>Antonio Rossi</i>
<i>can smell the gun on a man.</i>

433
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,638
<i>So you must</i> kill <i>him with the knife.</i>

434
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,598
(echoes) <i>You must</i> kill <i>him with the knife.</i>

435
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,198
D <i>Verdi's "Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves"</i>

436
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,955
Hold on, cowboy.
Where do you think <i>you're</i> going?

437
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,076
These flowers are for the lady.

438
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,030
(Rossi) You do what you have to do...

439
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:01,318
...but don't come back to me unless you
have that cocksucker's finger in a bag.

440
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,828
Mr Rossi.

441
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,837
Flowers. For Kari.

442
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,477
Carlo, let me get back to you.

443
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,037
(Rossi) Who the fuck
you got sending you flowers?

444
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,350
Be nice if <i>you</i> sent me flowers sometime.

445
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,795
The rock on your finger ain't nice enough?

446
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:28,749
You two-time me, bitch, I'll have those
fake titties shipped back to the surgeon.

447
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,036
Who sent these flowers?

448
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,836
The Dragons.

449
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,478
(screams)

450
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,397

(whimpers)

452
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,840
(voices chant command in Cantonese)

453
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,756
(thunder)

454
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,796
(chanting continues)

455
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,112
(gasps)

456
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:49,469
We did not expect you to survive.

457
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,590
And it seems you walk with the Dragon!

458
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,636
You have the gift...

459
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,633
...the dark gift of the death walker.

460
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:03,679
(chanting echoes)

461
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,318
The killer who cries.

462
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,638
Your tears... are your honour, Dragon.

463
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,072
You have become your faith.

464
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,070
(chanting fades away)

465
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,116
(Yo pants)

466
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,349
(shouts) No!

467
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,949
<i>The witch had visited me in the night.</i>

468
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,190
<i>She'd put a mark on my body.</i>

469
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,319
<i>There was nothing I could do to erase it.</i>

470
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,356
<i>The Dragon tattoo.</i>

471
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,556
<i>I would be so marked forever.</i>

472
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,915
(screams)

473
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,397
(man) The Dragon's taken you.

474
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,518
Your mind. Your body.

475
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,000
His image marks you, Freeman.

476
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,996
It is the image of your soul.

477
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,516
The longing for freedom.

478
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,430
There is no freedom on earth.

479
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,674
True freedom is in the spirit...

480
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,877
...in the skies, where the Dragon soars.

481
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:04,112
Let the dream of soaring to the skies
sustain you.

482
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,236
I am Koh.

483
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,637
Your guide.

484
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,999
You serve the Sons of the Dragons...

485
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,469
...the guardians of the Chinese people.

486
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:23,678
Those who trespass against our race...
must die.

487
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,116
You will obey us...

488
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,272
...our laws, our rules, our demands.

489
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,516
For we own you now.

490
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,956
You were born a killer.

491
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,750
It is a power that belongs to you.

492
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,873
I will shape it, I will make you stronger...

493
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,077
...I will make you faster,
I will make you deadly.

494
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:48,598
Our enemies will feel the Dragon's claws
pierce... their dead hearts.

495
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,911
Come now.

496
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,956
You are reborn.

497
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,676
You are...

498
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,991
(whispers)... the Freeman!

499
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,716
And your tears?

500
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,472
I don't know.

501
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,238
They say all Freemen
carry a special curse.

502
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,277
Perhaps they are mine.

503
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,911
But don't you understand?

504
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,476
Koh told you to kill me.

505
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,871
You didn't.

506
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,231
(whispers) You fought them.

507
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,117
And you won.

508
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,834
It's so peaceful here.

509
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,876
(birds twitter)

510
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,392
Yes, Koh?

511
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,431
We have been attacked.

512
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,356
The Dragon is angry.

513
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,392
In here.

514
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,272
Ryuji Hanada has sent us a challenge.

515
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,918
Look.

516
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,391
- They're setting you up.
- (Koh) They want you dead.

517
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,029
Whoever kills the Freeman
becomes the Yakuza leader.

518
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,270
Get ready. We must leave.

519
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:11,076
- Now.
- No! You don't have to go.

520
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,992
He <i>is</i> the Freeman.
He serves the Sons of the Dragons.

521
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:20,232
- He is obliged to come with me.
- Emu...

522
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,356
16 people died, Emu.

523
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,670
They had families, children.

524
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,709
Ryuji killed them and will continue to kill
unless I go to him.

525
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,711
(Koh) Ryuji can identify the Freeman.

526
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:35,430
<i>Anyone</i> who can identify the Freeman
must be eliminated.

527
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,153
That is the law
of the Sons of the Dragons.

528
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,957
We must go to Tokyo.

529
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,395
Ryuji will be at Shimazaki's funeral.

530
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,190
(man chants, drum beats)

531
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,799
Thank you.

532
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,075
- (woman screams)
- (gurgles)

533
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,356
Leave her.

534
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,360
She knows the laws of the underworld.

535
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,510
You are getting <i>soft,</i> Freeman.

536
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,116
(chanting, drum beats)

537
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,635
Shimazaki to wa tomodachi wa.

538
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,234
- (door bursts open)
- (shouting)

539
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,589
Hey, you should knock on the door.

540
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,513
If I could, Ryuji,
I would knock your head off.

541
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,472
You've gone too far.

542
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:40,793
Someone has to pay for the massacre
of those 16 Chinese in the soya factory.

543
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,431
So, you will find <i>someone.</i>
That's your job.

544
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,512
But... you are my number one suspect.

545
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,959
And in order to do my job,
I've gotta be gum on your shoe.

546
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:56,510
So... Chairman Blade...

547
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,870
...what are we having for dinner tonight?

548
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,160
A little insincere, that. Hm?

549
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:10,439
After all, it was you who sent
Shimazaki's son to San Francisco.

550
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:16,558
And there are... a lot of people who
would be very interested in knowing that.

551
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,758
Come here.

552
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,353
My lady.

553
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,192
Anata no tomodachi wo shokai shite
kudasaru no desho.

554
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:34,751
Netah... let me introduce you to my wife.

555
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,156
This is... Netah.

556
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,797
The cop.

557
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,236
Have we met, madam?

558
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,795
Why are you here, Mr Netah?

559
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,836
Is there any problem?

560
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,870
Police business
and, er... some personal business.

561
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:57,839
Netah thinks he's going to steal
the Freeman from me.

562
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,432
But why you wait for him to come to <i>us?</i>

563
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:06,313
An animal on the hunt
is that much more deadly.

564
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,956
- At home, he just dozes in his lair.
- Meaning?

565
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:16,238
We obtained a list of passengers
departing Vancouver...

566
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,039
...the day Emu O'Hara left the hospital.

567
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,759
No, she wasn't on any of those flights.

568
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,910
Miss O'Hara was <i>not...</i>

569
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:29,034
...but a young woman
<i>was</i> on the flight for Tokyo.

570
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,991
Alone, no luggage.

571
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,991
Fake passport.

572
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,676
Miss O'Hara...

573
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,236
...is in Japan, Netah.

574
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,108
We have her photograph
all over the country.

575
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,395
Everyone is looking for her.

576
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,915
She is with the Freeman.

577
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,956
She is his mate.

578
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,435
You remember what I said, Ryuji.

579
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,632
Madam, I, er...

580
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,870
I wish I... I'll see you again.

581
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,994
Of <i>course</i> we shall, Mr Netah.

582
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:12,715
Japan is a small country.

583
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,914
And our family is... very large.

584
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:31,238
(bell chimes,
chanting and drumming continue)

585
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,750
(woman whispers) Netah-san.

586
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,952
It seems you are the kind of man
who follows a woman.

587
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,315
Only when she wishes to be followed.

588
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,358
And you did want me
to follow you, didn't you?

589
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:13,274
I don't want the society members
to see me talking to you.

590
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:17,872
Come here. I have some
important information to give you.

591
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,269
And I don't want to talk too loud.

592
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,392
You bitch!

593
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:44,520
To rape the wife of a Yakuza Boss
is a very serious crime.

594
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,716
They would kill you for it.

595
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:54,159
You see, Mr Netah, your fumbling attempt
at blackmail has come to nothing.

596
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,839
If I'm to be lost, I shall take my prize.

597
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,476
(she pants)

598
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,996
You know, Mr Netah...

599
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:05,914
...you could be a great asset to us,
if you wanted to be. (gasps)

600
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,992
(Netah) How could you? How could you?

601
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:12,959
- How <i>could</i> you?
- You take what you want, Mr Netah.

602
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:20,917
And... I take what I want... all the time.

603
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,436
(breathlessly)
But it's not Ryuji at <i>all,</i> it's <i>you.</i>

604
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,876
It's <i>you.</i> You planned it <i>all.</i>

605
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:32,875
You wanna be the Chairman,
a woman chairman.

606
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:37,238
- (laughs)
- Did you know, Mr Netah...

607
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,880
...an American lives on Hokkaido?

608
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,676
Perhaps...

609
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,477
Perhaps we shall pay her a visit.

610
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,716
(her breathing intensifies)

611
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,756
(she cries out)

612
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,597
Ohh.

613
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,396
(coughs)

614
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,196
(groans)

615
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,877
(she gasps)

616
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:12,870
(shouts)

617
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,918
(shouts)

618
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,079
(gasps)

619
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,311
(screams)

620
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,078
(screams)

621
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,316
You are the Freeman!

622
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,478
(screams)

623
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,117
(all yell)

624
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,432
(groans)

625
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,791
The man is a devil.

626
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,556
- Let's move.
- Go ahead. I'll take care of Ryuji.

627
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,956
(gunfire, shouting)

628
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,952
- (groans)
- (yell)

629
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,670
Tell Satan I said hello.

630
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,234
(yell)

631
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,391
Now you die, Freeman.

632
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,072
(yells)

633
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,316
(screams)

634
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:41,950
(yell)

635
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:54,672
It was my job...
to serve and watch over you.

636
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,554
It was my job... to kill you.

637
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:04,358
You broke the law, my friend.

638
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,436
You should have killed her.

639
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,790
She turned you from us.

640
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,396
(gasps)

641
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,760
<i>Yo returned in the middle of the night.</i>

642
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,116
<i>He kept himself hidden,</i>
<i>but I knew he was there.</i>

643
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,156
<i>I could feel his eyes.</i>

644
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,588
<i>Our enemies were coming for us.</i>

645
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,316
<i>He said I had nothing to fear...</i>

646
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,356
<i>... I was not alone.</i>

647
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,797
May I help you?

648
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:36,997
- You are Emu O'Hara?
- I am.

649
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:40,789
You know what's good for you,
you cooperate with us.

650
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,871
We just might let you live.

651
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,232
(man laughs)

652
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:24,595
(groans)

653
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,678
(screams)

654
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,397
(yells)

655
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,196
(groans)

656
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,036
(timer beeps)

657
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:50,836
(yell)

658
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,472
(yell)

659
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,879
(gunfire)

660
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,956
(screams)

661
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,316
(beeps)

662
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:23,271
(gasps)

663
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,916
I've <i>got</i> you, Freeman!

664
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,234
(grunts)

665
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,956
(groans)

666
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,836
Lke!

667
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,716
(all yell)

668
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:52,478
(screams)

669
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,038
(gasps)

670
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,472
(yells)

671
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,996
(shouts)

672
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,799
(screams)

673
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,829
(groans)

674
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,991
Ha!

675
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,312
(shouts)

676
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,150
(gasps)

677
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:35,995
If you remove the knife,
you will bleed to death.

678
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,552
You will report...

679
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,152
...that it was Yo the potter...

680
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,150
...who killed Shuru Shimazaki...

681
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,951
...President of the Hakushin Society.

682
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,556
The motive...

683
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:54,953
...was some past dispute.

684
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,320
Today, he fought against the men...

685
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,356
...of the Hakushin Society.

686
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,791
And after fighting bravely...

687
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,631
...he died.

688
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:13,029
You want me to...

689
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,950
...help you in your deception?

690
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:18,952
We will vanish and you will forget us.

691
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,195
The Freeman... is dead.

692
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,713
Emu O'Hara... is dead.

693
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:30,192
You...

694
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:34,510
...are my... enemy!

695
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,036
(gasps)

696
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,188
(struggles to breathe)

697
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:52,830
Live honourably... or die miserably.

698
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,077
Decide now.

699
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,796
On my...

700
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,997
...honour!

701
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,595
- No!
- I didn't give <i>my</i> word.

702
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:58,076
(whispers) But I did.

703
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,076
(beeps)

704
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,918
(explosion)

705
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:34,116
<i>(Emu) Our enemies are many.</i>

706
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:38,198
<i>Even if we destroy</i>
<i>all trace of ourselves...</i>

707
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,950
<i>... even then,</i>
<i>they wil keep searching for us.</i>

708
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,955
<i>The code of honour demands it.</i>

709
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,760
<i>The fires will not burn</i> that <i>away.</i>

01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,395
<i>I have never been afraid of death.</i>

711
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:00,429
<i>And whether we live, or die...</i>

712
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,036
<i>... we</i> will <i>be free.</i>
