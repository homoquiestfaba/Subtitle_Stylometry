1
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:19,561
We would like to remind you
that the taking of photographs...

2
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,980
is prohibited and is hazardous
to the performers.

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:28,070
Please turn off all cell phones
and pagers. Enjoy the performance.

4
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:16,589
The soap opera is when I asked him
onstage if he's been dating her...

5
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,050
and he's like,
Shut up.

6
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,009
- Get out of here.
- No, I'm serious.

7
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,427
It's too much drama.

8
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,971
- More than what it's worth.
- I know. He was pissed.

9
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,514
- Yeah I know, it's true.
- We'll see you in class.

10
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,310
I heard she said, 'So how long
you been fucking her? '

11
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,608
- We need to talk.
- Ry? Don't be ridiculous.

12
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,947
Good morning.

13
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,331
Who's teaching today?

14
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,834
- Mark.
- Mark!

15
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,634
- Mind if I share this with you?
- Yeah. Sure.

16
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:26,302
I wanted to talk to you about Ry.
I'm having some issues with her...

17
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,514
Could you just pair her up
with somebody else?

18
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,307
- Who are we talking about?
- Loretta Ryan, Ry.

19
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,767
- Oh, Ry.
- Yes.

20
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:37,523
- Things aren't going smooth and...
- I thought you two...

21
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:41,944
Leave that part out of it
and stick with the dancing.

22
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:45,572
You'd like to sit in this chair?
You could run the company.

23
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,115
I'll stick with the dancing.

24
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:51,245
- Who's next, Cammie?
- We have...

25
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,334
There's no announcements,
so let's start with plies.

26
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,545
Left hand on the barre,
second position.

27
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,507
Ready, Paul? And...

28
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,848
Good.
A one...

29
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,310
Good.

30
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,064
Drop the chin.
Take the head...

31
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,238
1, 2, 3,
grand plie.

32
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,451
That's my spot.
Sorry.

33
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,329
Stretching to the bar...

34
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,747
Would you mind standing
over there. Thank you.

35
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,252
Forward, one...

36
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,225
Up to go back...

37
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,355
And demi...

38
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:07,069
Tondue, close arms and
legs together.

39
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,490
Good. A one, two...

40
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,831
Drop the chin...

41
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:25,630
And drop your tailbone.
Good.

42
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,346
And stretch to the bar.
Good.

43
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,518
Do you know how long we have waited
for a Lar Lubovitch ballet?

44
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:38,851
I'm glad to hear that.
Thank you.

45
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:44,482
- Mr. A is very grateful to you.
- I'm grateful to be here.

46
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:48,736
Please say hello for me.
I'll see him later.

47
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:53,533
Good morning. Is Alec here?
Alec have you warmed up?

48
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,744
You're warm enough
for lifting?

49
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,995
Absolutely.

50
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,039
Then let's start from the first
lift after the solo, Maia.

51
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,668
We'll get back to it
after Alec is gone.

52
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:08,423
Let's see what you've got and
then we'll just work on...

53
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:13,928
A little further over from center.
Paul if you'll play the two little...

54
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,889
I believe that's marked in
the score. Ready?

55
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:29,735
- And let's stop.
- I didn't let you get very far.

56
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:35,116
You're overworking that position.
More subtle, not so high in the knees.

57
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:39,955
A little bit more hung.
Mostly along the shoulders.

58
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:43,708
Not so much in the face. It's
beautifully expressive in the face.

59
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:48,589
But let's make it work in
the body first, okay?

60
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:49,923
Once more.

61
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,144
Good.

62
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:16,365
And up.

63
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,917
And stop please.
Are you working injured?

64
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,836
I have a neck spasm.

65
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,674
You shouldn't work injured.
Why don't you mark in the back.

66
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:38,013
Rest a little bit. We'll
pick this up tomorrow.

67
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:42,768
- It should be fine.
- I have to ask you your name.

68
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,311
- Ry.
- Ry.

69
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,937
- Domingo.
- Domingo.

70
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,524
- Is Ry short for something?
- Ryan.

71
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,318
Nice name.
Have you been watching this?

72
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,153
- So you kind of know it?
- Yeah.

73
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,907
Well, let's see what you've got.
Domingo and Ryan.

74
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:02,453
Same process, with music just
before the lift. Let's see.

75
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,505
And up. Up one piece.
Good, Domingo.

76
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,924
Melt. Music.

77
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,273
Lift, contretemps...

78
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:33,360
Swing, up and down...

79
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,950
Let's stop there. Good.
You have been watching.

80
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,788
How much we respect you as an
artist and senior dancer...

81
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,957
but we wanted to talk with
you today about class.

82
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,211
We'd like you to be an example
the new dancers.

83
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,546
And usually you are.

84
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,381
But if you change combinations
they think they can change too.

85
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,466
But I only change the
combinations at the barre.

86
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:02,471
- They look everything you do...
- But I'm 43 years old...

87
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:06,726
and when it comes to rehearsal
I do what I'm told to do.

88
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,147
- You could come in early...
- Let her do what she has to do.

89
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:13,317
Remember we had that girl that
used to come in an hour beforehand?

90
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:17,904
- She's not doing the roles that I...
- But look at Margot Fonteyn...

91
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:22,408
Margot Fonteyn.
Robert knew her very well.

92
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,580
I knew her too but not as well
as Robert. We hear you.

93
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,541
You know, she was a dame.

94
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:34,212
Do you have anything else you want
to talk about before we finish?

95
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,883
Actually I'd like to talk about
the ballet Light Rain.

96
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:42,513
It's a great ballet, but I feel some
of the footwork is too fast.

97
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:47,225
- Like the jete, jete, step...
- So you don't want to be in?

98
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:50,102
Well, it's just that I look
like I'm working in it.

99
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,273
- Deborah, we hear you doll.
- We just wanted you to be first.

100
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,985
Thank you.
And I feel honored.

101
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:02,740
Where'd you get this salad?
It's terrible.

102
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,244
Who can do it?

103
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,138
Watch on walking lady lift,
the position of his arms...

104
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:16,559
She's not horizontal to the floor.
They may not be doing it perfectly...

105
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:22,481
This is the danger point for you.
Don't let that leg bobble.

106
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,653
Why don't we try that.
Okay?

107
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:31,825
Try without music. Let's just do a
little ronde de jambe preparation.

108
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:39,332
And attitude...
And ronde de jambe...

109
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:43,836
And up... more fragile in
the legs. Whoops.

110
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,134
Alec, can you give us a hand?
Have you been watching this lift?

111
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:54,597
The objective is to get her a bit
removed from your body...

112
00:16:54,597 --> 00:17:00,062
And at a bit of a diagonal rather
than parallel to the floor.

113
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:03,273
Let me see how you would hold
her to accomplish that.

114
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:07,568
- Lf you stayed to the side...
- Fairly lower on her hip.

115
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,949
Good.

116
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:18,163
You know what the difference is?
He's locking his elbow in here.

117
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:21,625
Try it with music
and we'll see what we've got.

118
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,711
Mark, you're going to work with
Amanda and Willy.

119
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,548
And I would like to have
the four ladies over here.

120
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,676
Alright, Mark.

121
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,971
We're getting ready to start
from the fourth movement...

122
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,098
Take your places lease.

123
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:48,734
Company, just move all this crap!
You're going to trip over it.

124
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,573
Don't leave your stuff
by the side of the stage.

125
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,241
Mark, you know we can't start
with all this clutter.

126
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,244
I know. We told them right
before this rehearsal...

127
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:02,624
Well you know...
If somebody falls over...

128
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,794
Ok, Cammie we're ready.
Everyone, places please.

129
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:09,131
Michael, when you're ready.
Two men, you're ready?

130
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,673
Here we go.

131
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,768
Sharp jump...

132
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,770
Good, you guys.

133
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,401
Ell him to stretch his foot. - All the way in the wings. Go

134
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,028
Stretch the knees.

135
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,616
Exit all the way.
Good.

136
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,760
Right on the music.
Good, Suzanne.

137
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:03,309
- Suzanne's gotten very strong.
- Excellent.

138
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,859
Good, Calvin.

139
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,617
He's come along
beautifully.

140
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,787
We have to work on that
double knee saut de basque.

141
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:34,549
Tell Noel to burst from
the wings on her sauté.

142
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,846
Good ladies!

143
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:44,643
Hold it a minute.
Hold it a minute.

144
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:48,605
What happened? I mean,
you're all so pretty.

145
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,898
You know how
I hate pretty!

146
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:56,363
Now come on. Lift, thighs.
Lift up, not so loady.

147
00:19:56,363 --> 00:20:02,286
And when you make those exits
hit the wall.

148
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:05,622
You're not doing that. You look
like you've got a load in your pants.

149
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:11,002
But I love you all. You're great.
Come on.

150
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,865
- Oh my God, a storm.
- I think it's just the wind.

151
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:09,246
Have a good time.
Most importantly enjoy it. Ok?

152
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:10,454
Merde.

153
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,207
And main curtain...

154
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,294
Go!

155
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:24,510
Follow spot one on the girl.
Nice and easy, follow spot.

156
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,054
Sound.

157
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:12,304
Can you watch this
leg for me?

158
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:14,388
Careful. Keep that from
flopping down.

159
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,759
Char, you better go back and
see what's happening.

160
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,097
If there's any water on the stage
cancel the performance right now.

161
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:02,980
Hurry up.

162
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:45,771
What did they say?

163
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,400
The floor is dry.
Michael's got it under control.

164
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,278
- It's a little chilly.
- Good. She's doing brilliantly.

165
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,528
- That was so good.
- Thank you.

166
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:16,529
That was so good,
Domingo.

167
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:22,286
Are you coming back?

168
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:28,500
Domingo.
The hero of the moment.

169
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:33,630
What a courageous performance.
Scenery by Mother Nature.

170
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:36,633
I don't believe you.

171
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:39,720
- I'm Ryan's mother, Marilyn.
- You should be so proud.

172
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,847
Thank you for that beautiful
ballet. My daughter was the dancer.

173
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,057
- Lar.
- Alberto!

174
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:50,897
You were magnificent.
Did you organize that storm?

175
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:54,776
Domingo.
Fantastic.

176
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:56,444
Hi, Dad.
How you doing?

177
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,160
- You were beautiful.
- Thank you.

178
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,243
Hi, mom.

179
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,788
I want to invite you to come and
do a piece next season.

180
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:10,917
- I have to speak to Mr. A.
- Now where is she?

181
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:15,547
Oh baby. Give me a hug.

182
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:20,801
I'm watching you saying,
Who is that up there?

183
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:24,515
I've always believed in you even
when others weren't so sure.

184
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:26,474
- But always.
- But tonight...

185
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:30,604
You went to another dimension.
And the storm, the storm!

186
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:34,942
- Wasn't that crazy?
- It was so theatrical.

187
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,652
- Was it slippery?
- A little slippery.

188
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:38,694
- You would never have known.
- You had such poise.

189
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,905
- Is this your sister?
- No, this is my mother.

190
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:45,243
- I can't believe this.
- Thank you for your genius.

191
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:47,954
Well, you look so beautiful.
I can see the resemblance.

192
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:49,539
- This is your father too.
- This is my stepfather.

193
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:52,960
- I see the resemblance.
- I'm the father.

194
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,131
- Of course. And you are?
- Ginger.

195
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:02,094
As in Ginger Rogers.
She wasn't so bad, was she?

196
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:04,304
- Enjoy yourselves at the party.
- Thank you. We will.

197
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:07,598
- Very nice to see you.
- Thank you. Mr. A.

198
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,234
To Justin.

199
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:24,782
Mr. A wants to do the ballet.
But I talked to Harriet.

200
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,785
She said if I take it to
Tucker he'd say no.

201
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:30,079
- Eldridge Wright.
- Oh, my god. How are you?

202
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,500
- Can I get a glass of champagne?
- How you doing?

203
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,422
- I'm fine. How you doing?
- You did good tonight.

204
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:41,133
- Thanks.
- So how'd you feel about it?

205
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:45,929
- I felt good about it.
- Yeah? Good.

206
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,055
Did Noel like it?

207
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:50,976
- Do you know Lar, the choreographer.
- Yes.

208
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:55,396
I didn't appreciate being the last
one to find out about you.

209
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:59,233
- That wasn't cool.
- You and I know what it was.

210
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:03,113
Apparently you did. I didn't.
Any way have a good night.

211
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,535
- I'll call you. Alright, good.
- Yes.

212
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:09,827
Mr. A?

213
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:13,539
Can I talk to you about Justin
for a second?

214
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,460
- Wait a minute.
- There is a problem with...

215
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:21,464
The protocol is this, you call
the company, you talk to Edouard...

216
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:23,217
- and you make an appointment.
- I understand.

217
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:28,055
Thank you.
All the best to you.

218
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:32,768
Honestly people are so rude.
It's just too much really.

219
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:09,632
Just to confirm: Maia and Suzanne
are in every single ballet...

220
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:12,219
- Do they have covers?
- Yeah we've taken care of that.

221
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,929
Can we have a drop-dead date
so I can tell wardrobe?

222
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:17,891
The dancers must know the cast
one week in advance.

223
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,268
And they always do.

224
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:22,396
- Are you guys finished up?
- You've almost done.

225
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:25,023
- Not really.
- You've finished your meeting.

226
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:26,525
Yes sir.

227
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:34,157
Mark? Would you mind staying.
Char would you mind, darling?

228
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:38,244
And Harriet you stay too.
Robert, is this going to be ok?

229
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:41,914
My sketches are pretty big.
We might need a bit more room.

230
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:47,378
We could use the conference table.
Get rid of those bagels.

231
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:50,340
Good, good.

232
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:57,556
- So we start with a giant snake.
- What are you doing here? Out!

233
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:00,726
That's beautiful.

234
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:06,273
So we start with a giant snake
on stage. It's just floating...

235
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:09,233
- glowing blue in a void of black.
- How many dancers?

236
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:13,197
There's about twenty dancers.
But to make it really smooth...

237
00:35:13,197 --> 00:35:15,740
- Can you do it with ten?
- No, we couldn't do it.

238
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,119
- Could we cut the tail off?
- Maybe. Yeah.

239
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,039
Then from the snake flowing like
that the black curtain goes up...

240
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:28,670
it reveals the blue snake
and it has the Shiva characters.

241
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,755
Of the cosmic dancer,
the storyteller.

242
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:34,635
- What's the ballet called?
- Blue snake.

243
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:38,847
The snake representing the spine.
The blue is the energy in the spine.

244
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:43,184
I don't think you understand our
financial situation here.

245
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:46,146
I'm working with mirrors
as it is.

246
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:50,442
This piece will be fantastic
on this company.

247
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:53,445
I believe you.
That's why you're here.

248
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:58,699
Someone has to underwrite this.
It's going to be so expensive.

249
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:03,038
I'm going to have to sell it to
the board. Excuse me? What.

250
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:09,043
Would you excuse me?
I've got an important thing.

251
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:12,172
- I can continue with the staff.
- Let me just tell you...

252
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:16,300
You are a genius. I'm never wrong
about these things, am I?

253
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,971
- He never appears to be.
- Ok. Thank you.

254
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:20,514
Thank you very much.

255
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:22,974
- Oh, Robert?
- Yes?

256
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:26,644
Three things to remember:
Budget, budget, budget.

257
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:28,813
I will do my best.

258
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:34,527
- When we'll get the music?
- The music is being written now.

259
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:38,030
- Well then for rehearsals?
- There is no music.

260
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,199
Counts?

261
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,869
No counts. I like the dancers
to feel their own rhythm.

262
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:48,666
- And then the music can come in.
- Well, it'll be a new experience.

263
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,170
That's not good,
out of a straw.

264
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:56,675
Oh well, moving
right along.

265
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:03,431
We can pass it around.

266
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,576
Who threw this penis at me?

267
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:34,545
I think this is more you,
Missy.

268
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:37,798
I think that's more
your style.

269
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:46,682
We got a salmon position 1,
beef position 3, table 22.

270
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:49,393
Sorry.

271
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:51,188
Are you a dancer?

272
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:53,940
Thank you.

273
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:58,903
Got it.

274
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:06,786
Oh, John.

275
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:08,789
What are doing here?

276
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:13,543
I could stay here just for a
little bit, a couple of days.

277
00:38:13,543 --> 00:38:16,672
God, I am like booked.

278
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:19,967
You could put me on the floor.
I've got my sleeping bag.

279
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:23,135
- Just for a couple of days.
- Alright, come on in.

280
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:29,059
What's going on? I thought
you were staying with your family.

281
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:31,311
I was staying with my
aunt and...

282
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:40,612
I think she committed suicide.
So I can't stay there anymore.

283
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:43,699
Can I use your pen?

284
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:46,367
- God. I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

285
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,579
$8.50 a day, just for
a couple of days.

286
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:51,039
Just for a couple of days.
Definitely.

287
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:58,045
God, I'm so sorry. What's happened?
Did she shoot herself?

288
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:03,342
No, it wasn't that dramatic.
She took some pills.

289
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:07,097
I don't know, she was a little
crazy. She was very eccentric.

290
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:11,851
- So yeah, just a couple of days?
- Yeah, just a couple of days.

291
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:14,313
- You're last for the bathroom.
- Right.

292
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:41,507
And cross the fifths.
And...

293
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:58,398
That's it, long arms.
Shoulders down, ladies.

294
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:03,653
Lots of bourres.
Shoulders down.

295
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:09,742
Big arch.
Hold, 2, 3.

296
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:13,079
I got to say something here.
Mark, turn off the music.

297
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,333
Why do you always do this,
babies?

298
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:21,213
You always get phony on me.
I don't know why you do that.

299
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:25,800
This is supposed to the 60's.
This is what the '60s were all about.

300
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,556
Kids protesting against the war
trying to change the world...

301
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:36,228
so they bent the rules, turned to
drugs, took off their clothes.

302
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:41,440
They made a noise. Peace marches,
singing their songs in the streets...

303
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,112
carrying flowers when they were
being beaten and pushed around.

304
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:48,614
All that went
into this ballet.

305
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:56,581
You see, it's not the steps.
It's what's inside that counts.

306
00:40:56,581 --> 00:41:00,751
That's when you really
begin to soar.

307
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:05,215
Thinking the movement is not
becoming the movement.

308
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:43,480
Listen up company.
Hello? Is this on?

309
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,233
Have a great lay-off. It was a
wonderful show tonight.

310
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:53,072
And don't forget, practice
safe sex. Safe sex, babies.

311
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:59,161
And remember, fish, broccoli,
salad. No more chili con carne.

312
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:00,914
Have a great break.

313
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,961
Your grandmother got this when
she was 10 years old.

314
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:09,672
She wanted so much to be
a ballerina.

315
00:43:11,132 --> 00:43:17,556
It breaks my heart she's not here,
she'd be so proud of you.

316
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:23,269
I want you to talk to Mr. A.
To make good his promise.

317
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:27,983
And say, Hey Mr. A let's make
good on your word...

318
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:31,820
about the ballet you'll create for me.
I know you wouldn't do it that way.

319
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:35,865
You know, totally vulgar.
But still...

320
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:41,621
Remember that evening at that
wonderful party? He dazzled us...

321
00:43:41,621 --> 00:43:45,791
with his promise of building
a ballet for you...

322
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:51,380
- Where is he? Do you have any wine?
- In the fridge.

323
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,177
The fridge? I don't really feel
like white wine.

324
00:43:56,469 --> 00:44:00,891
I love it that you have red wine
in the fridge just like your mother.

325
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:05,394
Now look, let's get down here
to brass tacks. Loretta?

326
00:44:05,394 --> 00:44:08,606
- Mom?
- Darling, it's time.

327
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,985
I went to see Aunt Vynette today
in the hospital.

328
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:15,030
- How is she?
- She's sad, diminished.

329
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:19,409
I'm here to tell you...
I love your wig.

330
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:21,286
Life is short.

331
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:27,000
And it's time for you now.
You've been featured...

332
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,503
you've been acknowledged.
Your colleagues are wonderful...

333
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:34,340
- Mom, I'm going to be late.
- Those shoes are dangerous.

334
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,510
- No they're not. They're fine.
- You could break your neck.

335
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:42,099
- They're fine, Mom.
- Honestly. You have to go.

336
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:47,186
- This is yummy.
- Good. Coat.

337
00:44:47,186 --> 00:44:49,898
I'm going back to the hospital.
This suit cheered her up.

338
00:44:49,898 --> 00:44:54,235
- Give her my love.
- I'll give it, and I love you.

339
00:44:54,235 --> 00:44:57,322
- You don't need this.
- I push you because you're modest.

340
00:44:57,322 --> 00:45:02,452
- Your demur quality is enchanting.
- Let's get going.

341
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:04,996
You look very sexy right now.
I'm worried about you.

342
00:45:04,996 --> 00:45:09,835
- It's fine.
- Talk to Mr. A.

343
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:12,003
Bring out his appeal to his
Svengali instincts.

344
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:17,675
Hey Dwayne.
I'm in trouble huh?

345
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,943
Can I get a Jack and Coke
and a screwdriver?

346
00:45:37,737 --> 00:45:40,740
- I thought I'd pluck up the guts.
- So you did it?

347
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,409
- Yeah.
- I'll be back.

348
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:44,952
I did it. I got the balls up
and I did it.

349
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:13,106
- Do you have a condom?
- No.

350
00:46:25,409 --> 00:46:29,706
Sorry to wake you. Do you have
an extra condom?

351
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:32,960
- What?
- Do you have an extra rubber?

352
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,585
Yeah.

353
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,012
Just one is fine. Thanks.
Don't worry about leaving.

354
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:47,224
- Just stay as long as you want.
- Yeah. Thanks.

355
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:55,606
Now I'm not going to stand here
and go on about our next recipient.

356
00:46:55,606 --> 00:46:57,568
There simply aren't
enough words.

357
00:46:57,568 --> 00:47:01,947
But suffice it to say,
that his work stands for itself...

358
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:07,327
and has been a source of
inspiration to Italian Americans.

359
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:10,664
So please join me in
welcoming...

360
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:14,168
the Artistic Director of the
Joffrey Ballet of Chicago...

361
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:16,920
Mr. Alberto Antonelli.

362
00:47:29,432 --> 00:47:31,809
Thank you.
Please sit down.

363
00:47:35,688 --> 00:47:37,900
You know, I really deserve
this thing.

364
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:44,907
Because you Italian guys made it
hard for me to be a dancer.

365
00:47:44,907 --> 00:47:47,951
You know, you didn't help
one iota.

366
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:52,539
I had to hide my
ballet shoes.

367
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:57,418
And my Italian family,
they gave me such a hard time.

368
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:02,340
Listen, if your boys want
to be dancers...

369
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:07,221
please don't give them
a hard time.

370
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:10,474
That would really be
a special award to me.

371
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:53,237
- You better let me do that.
- Really?

372
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:58,284
- Yeah.
- It's probably a good idea.

373
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:01,329
Do you have a pan?

374
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:12,548
- I can make toast too.
- Toast is good.

375
00:52:25,561 --> 00:52:30,483
- What do you like in your eggs?
- I don't know. Anything.

376
00:52:30,483 --> 00:52:34,112
- What do you got?
- Not much. Let me see...

377
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:40,494
- Two tomatoes.
- Tomatoes are good.

378
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:43,704
- I have pepper. You want pepper?
- Peppers...

379
00:52:47,376 --> 00:52:51,880
- Do you have onions?
- No, but I have onion salt.

380
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:54,967
No, that's ok.

381
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:30,418
- Can you close the door.
- Sure.

382
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:36,300
So, great we're finally starting
Blue Snake rehearsals.

383
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,592
I love it.

384
00:53:38,885 --> 00:53:43,222
I just wanted to tell you a
little bit more about the piece.

385
00:53:43,222 --> 00:53:47,268
We haven't had a chance to
talk about it so much...

386
00:53:47,268 --> 00:53:50,021
so, here we are at
the beginning...

387
00:53:51,981 --> 00:53:57,528
- What's happening?
- That's Mr. A's chair.

388
00:53:57,528 --> 00:54:03,534
Oh, la chaise du maitre.
Je m'excuse. This one will do fine.

389
00:54:03,534 --> 00:54:07,873
At the beginning of the piece
we've got the storyteller...

390
00:54:07,873 --> 00:54:11,751
and the whole piece is like
stepping into a children's book.

391
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:18,090
So instead of opening the book
once he's done his opening solo...

392
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:21,135
the mouth of the snake opens
and the piece starts.

393
00:54:21,135 --> 00:54:25,681
We have the zebra characters,
they are in black and white...

394
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:29,644
sort of representing the dualism
of the world that we live in.

395
00:54:29,644 --> 00:54:35,567
And they come out like holding
hands and do a circle dance.

396
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:40,947
We enter into section two,
the mouth of the snake reopens...

397
00:54:40,947 --> 00:54:45,284
we're into the red section,
the monkeys are coming out.

398
00:54:45,284 --> 00:54:49,414
The whole piece is done sort
of in primal colors.

399
00:54:49,414 --> 00:54:53,418
It's all very kind of fun
and very colorful.

400
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:56,547
And we go through a solo for
a female balloon head...

401
00:54:56,547 --> 00:54:59,967
expressing sort of again
the joy of the child...

402
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:04,972
and eventually we come to this
finale which has the giant.

403
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:07,181
You still have a way to go
with your line.

404
00:55:07,181 --> 00:55:11,603
And you also need to work on your
allegro, especially Mr. A's allegro.

405
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:16,567
I love allegro. If you can dance
allegro, you can dance anything.

406
00:55:16,567 --> 00:55:19,652
If you're an allegro dancer,
there's nothing you can't do.

407
00:55:19,652 --> 00:55:26,284
They're in love with the
lyricism and all that.

408
00:55:26,284 --> 00:55:30,246
But you know what I call them?
Phony ballet. I hate it.

409
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:36,503
I fight with these guys
all the time.

410
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:39,630
I wanted you. I wanted Ry for
Snow pas, right?

411
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:40,673
Yes you did.

412
00:55:40,673 --> 00:55:45,012
- You went out and she aced it.
- Yes she did.

413
00:55:45,012 --> 00:55:47,472
Mark didn't want her for
Nellie Ely.

414
00:55:47,472 --> 00:55:51,143
Then he saw her in rehearsals.
She was fantastic.

415
00:55:51,143 --> 00:55:55,188
I know whereof I speak.
Edouard, yes?

416
00:55:55,188 --> 00:56:00,652
- Mayor's office in 20 minutes.
- I'll be right there.

417
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:03,030
No, I can't right now.
I'm late for the mayor.

418
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,530
He's always late.

419
00:56:28,387 --> 00:56:31,849
- You scared me. Hi.
- Hi.

420
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:37,105
- How'd you get in here?
- Oh, you gave me a key.

421
00:56:37,105 --> 00:56:42,235
- Oh, right. How are you?
- I'm good...

422
00:56:42,235 --> 00:56:45,239
- I think I need a bath though.
- No!

423
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:46,907
- I'm really dirty.
- No, I don't think so. No!

424
00:56:46,907 --> 00:56:50,117
Get out! Go. I'll be out
in a minute.

425
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:28,282
- What are you watching?
- I found it up there.

426
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:32,286
- No. You can't watch this.
- What is this?

427
00:57:32,286 --> 00:57:36,873
- Me, when I was little.
- Want a beer?

428
00:57:36,873 --> 00:57:40,710
That's okay. I got some.
This is fascinating.

429
00:57:43,422 --> 00:57:45,298
So work was good?

430
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:48,802
Yeah. You know...

431
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:58,978
- I missed you today.
- Well, I missed you.

432
00:57:58,978 --> 00:58:01,898
- Can't believe you're watching this.
- It's great.

433
00:58:01,898 --> 00:58:05,235
- It's humiliating.
- Which one is you. Right?

434
00:58:05,235 --> 00:58:07,445
On the left there.

435
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:11,949
The far too enthusiastic one.
Horrible.

436
00:58:13,242 --> 00:58:15,329
- Cute.
- Yeah.

437
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:23,836
I think if I really tried
I could do some of these moves.

438
00:58:23,836 --> 00:58:25,797
- You think?
- I think so.

439
00:58:25,797 --> 00:58:27,465
I bet you could.

440
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,260
Very good.
