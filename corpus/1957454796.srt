00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:03,387
It's like one o'clock
first thing he does,
he makes a sandwich.

462
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:05,627
That's what you always do
when you break into a place.
What was the sandwich?

463
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:09,611
Ham and three cheese.
With tomato sauce.
Right, three cheeses.

Anyways, he starts eating,
he's halfway through.

467

Now he's gotta take a shit.
So he goes downstairs,
he's sittin' on the throne...

468
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:23,146
Readin' some magazine.
What was it?
Time or> Newsweek?

- Current events?
- A good magazine.

470

Anyways, he gets done,
he goes upstairs, he

471
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:28,693
finds a water bed, which
he's never seen before.

472

He's only seen 'em on TV,
or he's heard about it.

473
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:34,636
So here he is, gettin' ready
to get in the waterbed,
and he finds...

474
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,354
What has he always wanted
to find his whole life
and can never find?

475

- [ All together ]

- Worth a lotta fuckin' money.

full of fuckin' old
baseball cards, right?

So he's jumpin' up and down,
creamin' in his pants,
flippin' through the cards.

He's so goddamn happy.
He feels he's gonna be rich,
he's got it made.

480
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,222
- He falls asleep.
- I was out of it
before I broke in.

Yeah, that's what I do
before a job: Downers.

Four hours later
he wakes up to the sound
of the key in the door.

and I'm like,
"who the fuck are you?"

00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:13,632
He's lookin' at me,
he picks up the phone,
he starts to call the cops.

00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:15,634
I'm like, shit, I realize
where I am, so I bolt.

into my apartment."

You were in the bathroom.

about this neighborhood.

00:57:50,075 --> 00:57:52,381
I mean, Jesus,

941
00:57:54,122 --> 00:57:56,777
I don't get it.
I don't get you.

942
00:57:56,821 --> 00:57:59,563
What?
You’ve turned me

It's not funny.
No, it's not funny.

946
00:58:08,223 --> 00:58:12,184
You fuckin' called me. You
asked me if you come over here,
if I could set you up.

947
00:58:12,227 --> 00:58:14,447
I fuckin' set you up.
I wanted to work!

I got you a fuckin' job.
You’re not workin'.

949
00:58:17,145 --> 00:58:18,797
You’re along for the

Learnin' shit.
I'm supposed to be
learning shit.

Hey, fuck you, man.

[ Katy ]
I'm sick and tired

00:58:53,051 --> 00:58:55,009
It's a good bar.

Hey, bros, let me

Hey, shang, he don't remember.
That figures.

978
00:59:49,107 --> 00:59:52,676
Double or nothin'
on the hockey bet.
You took b.C.

979
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:55,896
You’re down four grand.
You’re back in the hole.

980
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,464
Never bet with your heart, pal.

981
00:59:58,507 --> 01:00:01,598
All you guys.
Who gives a shit
about b.C., huh?

982

Anybody here

Hey, Jackie.

983
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:07,168
What?
If you wanna spend so much
time with these guys,

984
01:00:07,212 --> 01:00:11,129
why don't you just
fuck them, '’cause you
sure ain't fuckin' me.

985

Jesus, Jackie...
You mind your fuckin'
business, O'Grady!

986
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:15,916
Calm down.
I can't fuckin'
take it anymore!

987
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,962
You got your own
fuckin' problems
to think about.

I'm floatin' you
for four fuckin' grand,

Durin' blackouts?

Just lay off the fuckin' sauce.

991
01:00:27,101 --> 01:00:29,190
And another thing:

992
01:00:29,234 --> 01:00:32,237
You’re doing that
dealership job Monday night.
Don't forget.

993
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,199
I cut you off,
you’re back workin'
down in the wire factory...

Quicker than
you can wipe your ass.

995
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,291
End up just like
your dad. Got me?

996
01:00:45,598 --> 01:00:47,644
Buy yourself a fuckin' drink.

997

Come on, gimme a break.
Get in the car.

Let me see.
Yeah, I'm fine.

Does he
hit you a lot?
No.

1014
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:07,245
It's just... he's pissed off
about the dealership
and a bunch of other bullshit.

get away for a couple of days,

- Get the fuck out
while you still can.
- What do you mean?

1029

Nothing’s gonna change, okay?
Jackie'd go nuts
if he found out about us.

1030
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:25,976
Might as well face the facts
and get it over with.

1031
01:03:26,019 --> 01:03:31,198
I mean...
Just standin' still here.

1032

What are you gonna do?

1033
01:03:34,158 --> 01:03:38,075
Steal cars
and keep secrets from Jackie
for the rest of your life?

I just told him...
I laid it out for him.

Jesus, I hope
he didn't go back
to Dublin.

1052

Back to Dublin?
With what? His looks?

1053
01:05:22,353 --> 01:05:26,270
He couldn’t get across
the fuckin' bridge with those.
Wanna put the blow away?

1054
01:05:26,313 --> 01:05:31,188
What, you on the wagon?
Just keep your eyes
on the road, digger.

1055
01:05:31,231 --> 01:05:33,842
Okay, they're gonna lock
the shop up tonight at 9:00.

1056
01:05:33,886 --> 01:05:36,976
The alarm’s gonna be on,
so that's gonna guarantee
the insurance coverage.

1057
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:41,154
The Ferrari's gonna be parked
at the top of the ramp
at the third floor.

1058
01:05:41,198 --> 01:05:43,166
The place is gonna be
deserted, so get in there

1059
01:05:43,178 --> 01:05:45,158
quick and don't draw
attention to yourselves.

1060
01:05:45,202 --> 01:05:47,204
All right.

1061
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:57,823
Take the goggles off.
Take the fuckin'
goggles off.

1062
01:06:00,086 --> 01:06:03,568
What I want you guys to do
is break the window
on the ground-level floor,

1063
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:05,700
reach in there
and hit that button.

1064
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:11,315
Hurry up. Come on.
Go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go.

1065
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:16,189
Once the glass is broken,
you activate the alarm.

1066
01:06:16,233 --> 01:06:21,020
This gives you two minutes...
I repeat, exactly two minutes...
Before the cops show up,

1067
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:23,327
so don't be dickin' around.

1068
01:06:39,647 --> 01:06:43,608
Get to the third floor.
The Ferrari's gonna be parked
in the far corner.

1069
01:06:43,651 --> 01:06:47,177
You gotta hot-wire the car
to make it look real.
Why not let air out the tires?

1070
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:50,180
Mouse, we’re talkin' about
a fuckin' Ferrari here.

1071
01:06:50,223 --> 01:06:53,922
If the alarm isn't on,
there's no insurance money,
and none of us get a dime.

1072
01:06:53,966 --> 01:06:57,926
Quit breakin' my balls
and cut the bullshit!
Skunk, skunk.

1073
01:06:57,970 --> 01:06:59,928
You guys bring the car
back here.

1074
01:06:59,972 --> 01:07:02,412
As soon as skunk
hears from the buyer,
you guys get your money.

1075
01:07:02,453 --> 01:07:05,151
Twenty-fuckin'-grand.
Buy a lot of blow
for that.

1076
01:07:05,195 --> 01:07:08,328
Yeah, a lot of stepped-on blow
from you, Jackie.
You watch yourself.

1077
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,430
Shit.
Stay down.

1078
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:43,929
What-what happened next?
I pulled a Sweeney.

1079
01:07:43,972 --> 01:07:46,018
A Sweeney?
What the hell’s a Sweeney?
Yep.

1080
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,368
Remember that time
when Sweeney and I
stole a bus?
Yeah.

1081
01:07:48,412 --> 01:07:50,390
We were bein' chased
by the cops,
and we jumped on the "t"?

1082
01:07:50,414 --> 01:07:51,893
Yeah.
We pulled a Sweeney.

1083
01:07:51,937 --> 01:07:53,591
Hi, how are ya?
How the fuck ya been?

1084
01:07:53,634 --> 01:07:56,159
Pulled a Sweeney
in the middle of a job?
Yeah, it was classic.

1085
01:07:56,202 --> 01:07:59,075
That's great.
Let's go have some blow, huh?

1086
01:07:59,118 --> 01:08:01,773
Yeah, right. No.
Come on, Bobby,
open up here.

1087
01:08:01,816 --> 01:08:04,167
What the fuck?
What the fuck's
goin' on over here?
