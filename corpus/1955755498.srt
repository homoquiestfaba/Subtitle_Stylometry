If the great God above is of
such a vindictive nature,

181

until the day I die.

the damn Murphy story
by Monday.

Okay.

353
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:24,604

Uh, First Commandment?

"Thou shall have
no other gods."

I have a job to do here,

like that in here.

Hey.

366
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,718
What are you doing?

367
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,955
I'm carving an idol
of the goddess Kali.

368
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:18,925
Who's Kali?

369
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:21,260
She symbolizes

370
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,030
death, terror,
destruction,
on the outside,

371
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:28,167
but love, compassion
and rebirth on the inside.

372
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,269
Well, you can't
really tell, but this,
see this necklace.

373
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,470
It's gonna be
a necklace
of human skulls

374
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,574
and in each hand
she's gonna be holding
a severed head.

Hmm.

376
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:41,013
Harry, do you know
that Seth is carving
a naked woman

377
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:43,082
with skulls
and severed heads?

378
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,652
Mm-hmm. It's the
Second Commandment.

379
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:48,788
No false idols
or graven images.

380
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:50,923
And you don't think
that's a problem?

381
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:53,259
No, I think
it's cathartic.

382
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:56,696
He'll be fine.
He'll be fine. He's gonna see
his father this weekend.

383
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:57,864
Is that good?

384
00:24:57,864 --> 00:25:01,000
Remember there is good
in all the woes
that come upon us,

385
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,771
because evil cannot
proceed from God.

386

387
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,742
...will you come up
and sing the Shema?

Please, Go, Seth.

Please.

390
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:37,570
Um, I have a question
to put to the congregation
if you don't mind, Rabbi.

391
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:43,109
Is God willing
to prevent evil,
but just not able?

392
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:47,179
Then he can't be
omnipotent, right?

393
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:52,251
Or is he able,
but not willing?

394
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:57,023
Then he must be
malevolent.

395
00:25:57,023 --> 00:26:01,260
Or is he neither able
nor willing?

396
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,163
In which case,
why do we call him God?

397
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:09,068
Why indeed? Why?

398
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,803
In fact, you know what?

399
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:12,905

526
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:18,250
l think that
I can convince my client,
the bank,

527
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,520
not to press charges
as long as
you return the money.

528
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,156
And I'll even try
to get them to
waive the interest.

529
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,591
All in all, I think
that's a very good deal.

530
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:27,526
Look, I'm afraid
that's not possible.

531
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:29,261
They no longer
have the money.

532
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:31,497
You spent $250,000?

533
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:34,733
No, of course not.
Though, uh,

534
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:37,336
I did get
a nifty set of
power tools.

535
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:38,837
Okay. Where is it?

536
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:40,939
In the garage.

537
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:44,243
No, no, no. The money.
I'm talking about the money.

538
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:46,212
We gave it away.

539
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:47,613
To charity.

540
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,448
The Cetacean Society.

541
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:54,253
You know,
save the whales.

542
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:55,654
MAN: Uh, is, uh,
Rachel Luce in?

543
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,890
WOMAN: I'm sorry,
but she's in a meeting
right now.

544
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,792
Would you like
to wait?

545
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,896
All right,
let's take a break.

546
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,438
You know, every time
I look at them, l...
It makes me want to cry.

547
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:15,441
Not because
they're old and crazy,
which they are.

548
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:20,846
But because they're,
they're so strong.

549
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,382
They're so sure
of their place
in the world.

550
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,652
I don't know
how they do it.

551
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:30,822
I feel so adrift
right now.

552
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:36,928
Well, with good reason.
I mean, come on,
what with Harry and all that.

553
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:41,600
You know,
Harry cares more
about his stupid guitars

554
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,768
than he does for me.

555
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,305
You know what
you ought to do?

556
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:49,241
Is gather his guitars
together and just throw them
out in the street.

557
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:50,842
Throw 'em out.

558
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:53,011
Give him a chance to focus
on what he should be
focusing on...

559
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:55,581
Which is you.

560
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:58,750
I'd sure like to.
I'd like to smash them
to bits.

561
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,821
I mean,
he's gotta just wake up.

562
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:06,392
Yeah, but you know,
it's not really...
It's not all Harry's fault.

563
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:09,895
I haven't really...

564
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:12,931
Well, I've been...
I've been running
from everything

565
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,733
ever since Karen.

566
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,602
It's really hard.

567
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:17,436
I know.

568
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,741
Hey...

569
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,845
Do you remember this?

570
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,581
Yes, this is Karen's.

571
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,354
She said that was her window
into an unseen world.

572
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:36,422
Yeah.

573
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,730
I can see the sea.

574
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:53,439
It was your blue eyes.

575
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:05,817
(RINGS DOORBELL)

576
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,592
Hello, you...

577
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:14,826
Hey.

578
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,365
Watch it.

579
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:21,600
Let's go inside, huh?
Let's go in.

580
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:50,996
So, uh, how many times a week
would you see the Chief?

581
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:54,933
Three, sometimes four.

582
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,935
He was
very thoughtful.

583
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,770
We talked
on the phone a lot.

584
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,539
How often on the phone?

585
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:01,740
Every day.

586
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,711
Sometimes
twice a day.

587
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:10,982
Did, uh...

588
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:13,519
Did he tell you that this,
this, this house was owned
by the government?

589
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:20,926
We called it
our little safe house,
where all is permitted.

590
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:23,895
Hmm.

591
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:28,834
I'm getting
a certain vibe here.

592
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:31,136
Look, uh,
things are getting
a little complicated.

593
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:32,971
Can we, uh, just get on
with the interview?

594
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:35,574
Do we have to?

595
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:40,145
Yes. Did the, uh,
the Chief give you any,
uh, any gifts?

596
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:42,013
Sure.
What?

597
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:57,696
It's engraved,
to Buttercup.

598
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,064
Could you point that
in the other direction?

599
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:01,767
This little thing?
Yes.

600
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,973
Take off your clothes.

601
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:09,941
Look, Melissa,
if you think
that this triggers

602
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:12,511
some kinky
sexual fantasy of mine...

603
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:15,481
Not your fantasy, sweetie.
Mine.

604
00:40:15,481 --> 00:40:16,782
(CLICKS)

605
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:17,816
Uh-huh.

606
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,664
Next.

607
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:36,201
Can I help you?
Yeah.

608
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:39,037
I can't live with
the guilt any longer.

609
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,171
I'm here
to confess a crime.

610
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:50,181
Rachel.

611
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,619
Rachel, honey.

612
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:58,657
Seth.

613
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:02,193
(WHISTLING)

614
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,707
My guitars.

615
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,792
Hi, Harry.

616
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:34,926
I'm in here.

617
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,695
We've been burgled.

618
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,163
What?

619
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,267
What'd they take?

620
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:43,769
They took my guitars.

621
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:45,937
Oh, my God.

622
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:48,006
Is that it?

623
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,776
Yeah, that's it.

624
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:52,110
Broke in through
the bathroom window.

625
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:56,081
Oh, that's so weird.

626
00:41:57,616 --> 00:41:59,150
Oh, I'm so sorry.

627
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,586
They only took the guitars?

628
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:03,288
Yes.

629
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:05,056
They obviously knew
what they were doing.

630
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:09,628
Expensive,
easy to fence.

631
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:11,062
You know, I called
the insurance company
and made a claim.

632
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:14,900
It just makes me sick.

633
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,002
Wow, gosh,
I'm really sorry.

634
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,671
Let me get you a drink.

635
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:22,107
Thanks, honey.

636
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:23,742
Okay. All right.

637
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:30,115
(SOFTLY) Yes!

638
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:34,152
You know, you'd think
they'd take the goddamn
computer or something.

639
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:43,729
Rachel,

640
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,298
do you know
where Seth is?

641
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,635
All right,
here's the story.

642
00:42:49,635 --> 00:42:50,836
Harry Luce,

643
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,272
that's my brother-in-law.

644
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:56,842
Melissa Murphy,
that's his mistress,

645
00:42:56,842 --> 00:42:59,911
and myself conspired
to commit this crime.

646
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:04,282
What happened was
I took Harry's
guitar collection,

647
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:07,719
very rare,
very, very expensive,

648
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,689
made it look
like a robbery

649
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:14,359
and I stashed 'em
in Melissa Murphy's
basement, see?

650
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:19,865
And the idea
was we were all gonna split
the insurance money

651
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:21,066
three ways.

652
00:43:22,868 --> 00:43:25,737
Look, I got all that,
but, uh,

653
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:30,141
why you confessing?

654
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:33,645
Because stealing is wrong.
Did you ever hear
of the Eighth Commandment,

655
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:35,246
"Thou shall not steal?"

656
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:42,721
All right.
Do you mind, uh,
putting that down in writing?

657
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:45,156
No, not at all.
No problem.

658
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:48,259
Is he telling the truth?

659
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,928
MALHONEY:
Why would he lie?

660
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:51,262
Does it check?

661
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,934
So far so good.
We're working on it.

662
00:43:55,934 --> 00:43:57,135
We're gonna need
a warrant.

663
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:59,204
Well, get the warrant.

664
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:02,440
Get him on video.
Get him immunity.

665
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,309
Get him any fucking thing
he wants.

666
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,645
And get busy!

667
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,981
Yes, sir.

668
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:32,303
(SIGHS)
Thank you, Lord.

669
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:34,940
Thank you.

670
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,444
Melissa Murphy?
Yeah.

671
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:41,279
There's a warrant
to search the premises.

672
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:47,152
You can tell that
limp dick, fat, pinky haired
boss of yours

673
00:44:47,152 --> 00:44:49,487
that if this is his way
of expressing
his feelings for me

674
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:51,056
then he is
fucking pathetic!

675
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:58,329
Hello, Lucille.

676
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:12,811
Hey, what? What, did I
forget to give a donation
to the police benefit?

677
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:14,145
Let's go.
Hey!

678
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:15,380

call it in.

Warren!

680
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,792
You are demented, Warren.
Did you know that?

681
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:29,928
You ever heard
of the First Amendment?
Freedom of the press?

682
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:31,963
When the Tribune
gets done with you,

683
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:34,165
you are gonna be
cleaning toilets
in Bed-Stuy!

684
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:36,902
You're gonna be sweeping
the streets of East New York!

685
00:45:36,902 --> 00:45:38,269
Am I getting through to you,
you demented Mick?

686
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,075
Demented, huh?

687
00:45:45,844 --> 00:45:47,979
Let me show you
something, Luce.

688
00:45:48,814 --> 00:45:49,747
What?

689
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:58,223
(VOCALIZING)

690
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:19,510
Are you ready?

691
00:46:20,178 --> 00:46:21,947
For what?

692
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:25,316
You deserve
a day on the town.

693
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:28,153
Where did you
get those clothes?

694
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:29,888
What do you think?

695
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:32,590
I think you look
unbelievably great.

696
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,925
That too much?

697
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:34,792
No.

698
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:39,230
So you're going to
come out with me?

699
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:44,469
Um, yeah,
I'd love to.

700
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:47,172
False witness.

701
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:49,207
You never heard
of false witness?

702
00:46:49,207 --> 00:46:52,210
That wacko is throwing
the damn Commandments at me!

703
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,045
Calm down.
We should have you
out on bail by tonight.

704
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:56,181
Do you want me to call Rachel?
No, no, no, no.

705
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:58,516
She'll cast me
and Melissa
as Bonnie and Clyde.

706
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,986
She already thinks
I'm having an affair
with her.

707
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:02,020
Are you?

708
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:06,124
What has that
got to do with anything?

709
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:08,393
You listen to me.

710
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:12,163
There is a wacko,
fucking, crazy bastard
out there on the loose,

711
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,599
unhindered, coveting!

712
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:16,301
The fiend.
I'm serious.

713
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:20,906
Thou shall not kill.
What about that?

714
00:47:20,906 --> 00:47:23,208
You're right.
Oh, I know I'm right.

715
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:25,576
For the record,
if you were to be murdered,
how would that make you feel?

716
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,512
You get me outta here!
Just a short quote.

717
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:28,479
Get me outta here!

718
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,471
Thank you.
You're welcome.

719
00:47:56,274 --> 00:47:57,575
Oh, yeah.

720
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,511
It's a mango something.

721
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,612
Oh, yeah.

722
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:08,119
My, the... The water
looks so strange today,
doesn't it?

723
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:12,123
Oh, you know
what's that from?

724
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:13,558
Hmm?

725
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:16,127
That's from
that hurricane
down South.

726
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:18,429
Really?
Uh-huh.

727
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:19,697
See what happens
in a storm like that

728
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:21,632
is it pushes
the clouds so high

729
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:25,103
they become ice crystals,
and then they act
like prisms

730
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:28,106
and they
refract the light
in a strange way.

731
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,612
Think it's gonna hit
New York?

732
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:38,916
I don't know.
If it wants to.

733
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:43,321
Does it want to?

734
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:48,626
It's not really
proper to ask
a hurricane its desires.

735
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:56,267
Well, we don't
want to be improper.
Do we?

736
00:49:04,209 --> 00:49:05,510
Bullshit.

737
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:09,580
Where the hell
you been?

738
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,748
Is this gonna
take all night?

739
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:12,250
Could.

740
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,085
Oh, that's just great.

741
00:49:14,085 --> 00:49:16,021
And I have to tell you
there's this other problem.

742
00:49:16,021 --> 00:49:17,322
(SIGHS) What?

743
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:20,591
You're fired.

What?

746
00:49:23,228 --> 00:49:25,163
Mr. Jones thinks
you lost us the Murphy story,

747
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:27,032
cause you couldn't keep
your dick in your pants.

748
00:49:27,032 --> 00:49:29,000
I tried to tell him
it was more complicated
than that, but he...

749
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,501
Let's go, pal.
Now, come on.
Don't you...

750
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:31,469
Hey, get, get...
Watch the coat,
will you?

751
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:32,570
Shut your mouth.
Let's go.

752
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,039
Tell that bastard
I quit.

753
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:35,040
Sorry.

754
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:44,615
(SETH LAUGHS)

755
00:49:49,254 --> 00:49:51,122
It doesn't work
for me.

756
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:52,390
There's a little logic to it.

757
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:55,026
There's a little bone there,
and then...

758
00:49:59,397 --> 00:50:01,132
There you got it.

759
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:03,768
I got it.
You got it.

760
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:06,104
It's amazing.
How did you do that?

761
00:50:06,104 --> 00:50:08,439
I have no...
But see how far
I can...

762
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:10,007
No, don't touch me.

763
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,579
Hey,
where you going?

764
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:15,713
Where's the door?

765
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:17,082
Oh, my God.

766
00:50:17,082 --> 00:50:18,783
Bravo.

767
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:20,017
How did you do that?

768
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:25,656
You have great balance.

769
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:28,159
What about grace?

770
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,067
What about temptation?

771
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:42,340
What?
I'm sorry.

772
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,697
What if what I'm feeling

773
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:10,368
is all because you,
you loved my sister,
you know,

774
00:51:10,368 --> 00:51:14,239
and I'm attracted to you
because some sort of
perverse connection

775
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:16,741
between you,
me and her?

776
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:20,278
An ex-girlfriend
is bad enough,
but, uh, a deceased sister.

777
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:22,447
I mean, how can
I measure up to that?

778
00:51:23,648 --> 00:51:25,483
Come here.
Come here.

779
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:29,520
So is the real reason
that we're

780
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,624
holding each other like this
just one big mix-up
of transferred feelings?

781
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,129
Absolutely not.

782
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:39,297
Good.

783
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:46,604
Okay, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

784
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:48,339
What?
I have another question.

What?

786
00:51:54,879 --> 00:51:56,714
Am I a Commandment
to be broken?

Yes.

788
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,728
Is that all I am?

789
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:13,698
No.

it scares me.

too innocent that's all.

to you later.

shit yes.

1049
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:38,882
But it doesn't take
a genius to figure out

1050
01:13:38,882 --> 01:13:41,551
with just a dust ball
in the corner of the house

1051
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:42,952
that he doesn't give a shit
about house cleaning.

1052
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:47,791
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1053
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,061
What do you believe in?

1054
01:13:55,832 --> 01:13:57,133
I don't know.

1055
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:10,614
(GUN CLATTERS)

1056
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:23,092
(SIGHING)

1057
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:42,779
Seth! Seth!

1058
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:46,816
Seth!

1059
01:14:49,853 --> 01:14:52,188
(SCREAMING)

1060
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,201
Yes?

1061
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:40,169
Who are you?

1062
01:15:40,169 --> 01:15:41,705
Who are you?

1063
01:15:41,705 --> 01:15:43,206
I live here.

1064
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:44,708
Then why
were you ringing?

1065
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:46,676
Is Rachel in?

1066
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:47,877
She's sick.

1067
01:15:48,912 --> 01:15:50,079
What's wrong with her?

1068
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:51,715
A touch nauseous.

1069
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,619
Would you tell her
that her husband
is at the door?

1070
01:16:07,363 --> 01:16:08,898
She wants to know
what you want.

1071
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:10,033
What the hell
is going on in there?

1072
01:16:10,867 --> 01:16:11,868
Pinochle.

1073
01:16:14,771 --> 01:16:15,805
Tell her
I want to talk.

1074
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,842
I'll pass it on.

1075
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:23,279
Oh, my God.

1076
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,126
Hi.

1077
01:16:37,126 --> 01:16:38,361
Hi.

1078
01:16:39,896 --> 01:16:41,197
You can come in.

1079
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:55,144
Who are they?

1080
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,715
Friends.

1081
01:16:58,715 --> 01:17:00,884
I had sort of
a little breakdown.

1082
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:03,953
They've been very kind.

1083
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:15,098
Seth's dead.

1084
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:23,740
How?

1085
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:25,241
He murdered himself.

1086
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:27,243
Jumped into the sea
off Montauk Point.

1087
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:37,220
Look, Rachel,
I don't want to be alone.

1088
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:38,788
I want to come home.

1089
01:17:41,057 --> 01:17:42,992
No, it's not
going to work.

1090
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,193
I can change.

1091
01:17:47,964 --> 01:17:49,966
You don't understand.

1092
01:17:49,966 --> 01:17:51,768
I'm a changed man.

1093
01:17:53,236 --> 01:17:54,337
Why?

1094
01:17:55,438 --> 01:17:57,841
I don't want you back.

1095
01:17:57,841 --> 01:18:00,777
You gotta
give me a reason.
That's not a reason.

1096
01:18:00,777 --> 01:18:02,411
I deserve a reason.
Because I'm pregnant.

1097
01:18:04,948 --> 01:18:06,282
What?

1098
01:18:06,282 --> 01:18:07,884
It's not yours,
and I'm gonna have it.

1099
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:12,388
But how could
you know?

1100
01:18:12,388 --> 01:18:13,689
I know.

1101
01:18:15,158 --> 01:18:16,392
I just know.

1102
01:18:59,368 --> 01:19:01,437
(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

1103
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:30,166
Oh, my God!
What is that?

1104
01:19:45,581 --> 01:19:46,515
Oh, my God!

1105

1106

(GASPS)

1107
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:19,315
Okay. All right.
Let's give me your arm.

1108
01:20:50,313 --> 01:20:52,215
Why don't,
why don't we get
back down, all right?

1109
01:20:52,215 --> 01:20:53,482
I feel okay.

1110
01:20:53,482 --> 01:20:56,552
What?
Okay let's head on out.

1111
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:17,826
HARRY:
How do you explain a miracle

1112
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,596
in a world that can explain
most everything?

1113
01:23:22,798 --> 01:23:28,171
Maybe it's an emotion
so pure, it can freeze time.

1114
01:23:28,171 --> 01:23:32,007
Maybe, it's a man
stripped bare of all he was
seeing the world new again.

1115
01:23:34,177 --> 01:23:36,379
Yeah, sure
but what about me?

1116
01:23:36,379 --> 01:23:37,513
I'm alone.

1117
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:38,714
(SPARKY WHINES)

1118
01:23:38,714 --> 01:23:41,684
Oh, yeah, I get the dog,
but basically I'm alone.

1119
01:23:44,253 --> 01:23:45,621
Do I hate Seth?

1120
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:47,690
Well, yeah.

1121
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,761
But then again,
I'm not sure
it was all his fault.

1122
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:57,333
What if it was fate?

1123
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:59,468
I mean, how do you
fight that?

1124
01:23:59,468 --> 01:24:01,670
What do you fight it with?

1125
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:03,639
Heart, faith, soul?

1126
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:07,243
Ah, then how the hell
would I know?

1127
01:24:07,243 --> 01:24:09,312
I don't believe
in fairy tales.

1128
01:24:13,816 --> 01:24:16,585
But I do know
that what I don't know

1129
01:24:16,585 --> 01:24:19,255
might be a whole lot bigger
than I thought.

1130
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:24,660
(SHOUTING) Well?
