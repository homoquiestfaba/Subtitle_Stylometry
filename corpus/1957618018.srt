SHERIFF: Well sure.

192
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,136
But what's it all about?

193
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:39,072
Sir, you understand we have
to have your full support.

194
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,974

How many men
are on duty today?

00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,483
Actually just me.

200
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,553
But I don't understand
what you want me to do.

201
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:57,124
Ah, sheriff, are there
usually more men on duty?

202
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:58,625
Well, there's Emmett.

no one, and I repeat, no one

206
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:06,833
find out about this.

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,095
I'm tired of this shit.

00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,730
Well, that's just
too bad, isn't it?

There's a town about
20 miles ahead.

00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,603
We'll get something there.

Hey, come here, I want
to show you my new baby.

just figured the scenery would

365
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:56,769
be a little nicer out here.

366
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:57,504
Hm.

367
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:59,539
Well, you figured right.

368
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:00,973
Well, we'll be seeing ya.

369
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,809
Y'all have a good day.

370
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:03,543
You too.

371
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:04,944
Thanks for stopping by.

372
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,713
Hey, no problem.

373
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:07,480
See ya.

[birds chirping]

375
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,622
Stupid fucking hicks.

376
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:17,289
I hate this fucking town.

377
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,357
Come on, let's get on with it.

378
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,392
[birds chirping]

379
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:22,662
How long will this take you?

380
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:27,934
Oh, two or three
minutes a line.

381
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:29,235
Good.

382
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,003
But just do it so we can get
out of the fucking place.

383
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,139
[birds chirping]

384
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,980
You know, that was strange.

385
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,115
What?

386
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,817
Well, they just didn't
seem like the type to go

387
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,820
out of their way for a view.

388
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,656
Well, you never know, man.

389
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:50,790
Poor bastards are
probably from New

390
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,759
York, never seen a tree before.

391
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:55,327
They're used to seeing
faggots and pimps.

392
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,296
Yeah, but that's my point.

393
00:24:57,396 --> 00:25:00,066
You know, guys like that
don't do anything that doesn't

394
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,368
put money in their pockets.

395
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:06,606
And besides, how the hell would
they know where this road is?

396
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:07,840
Yeah, don't you
think you're getting

397
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,408
a little out of hand, Alex?

398
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,011
You want to turn around and
make a citizen's arrest or what?

399
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:17,584
ALEX: All right, all right.

400
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:20,019
So I've got an
active imagination.

401
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,354
It's all those damn detective
magazines you've been reading

402
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,390
and those guns and shit.

403
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,159
Oh.

404
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,662
I don't know.

405
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:32,064
You know, something
is strange about guys

406
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:34,266
dressed in suits sitting
in the middle of nowhere.

407

00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,611
Jeez.

409
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:48,581
What the hell now?

[birds chirping]

411
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:08,735
Shit, man, I don't believe it.

412
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:10,402
That was a brand new tire.

413
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,805
Well, now it's
old and fucked up.

414
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:13,740
Great, what should we do?

415
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,074
We can't go hunting now.

416
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,009
We can either leave the
car here and go hunting.

417
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,111
Or we can go back and try to
catch a ride with those guys.

418
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,047
Shit, man we can't
go hunting out here.

419
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:22,715
We're not far
enough out of town.

420
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,250
And the only thing
we're going to get here

421
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,551
is rabbits and squirrels.

422
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:26,953
And I can't hunt them
in my own backyard.

423
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:29,421
Look, dude, then let's
leave the car here and go

424
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,091
catch a ride with those guys.

425
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:34,593
Oh, great.

426
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:35,527
Come on.

427
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:36,763
We'll lock the car up.

428
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:38,530
Nobody's going to
bother our stuff.

429
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:39,732
And we'll go back down there.

430
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:40,900
Ain't nobody going
to bother it here.

431
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,335
No, in a town this
small, we'd know

432
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,603
who did it in five minutes.

433
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:45,537
Come on.

434
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:46,505
Damn it.

[birds chirping]

436
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,329
Five more miles and
you get your second meal.

437
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,732
What do mean, second meal?

438
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:16,602
That candy bar,
that was your first.

439
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:19,939
You're a real
asshole, you know that?

440
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,207
Yeah, that's
what they tell me.

441
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,846
Why do you treat me
like a piece of shit, hm?

442
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:28,347
Probably cause you
are a piece of shit.

443
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:33,219
You know, I make
my money in one hour

444
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,486
than you make in a year?

445
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:35,822
Not anymore.

446
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:41,060
I could set you up, Phil.

447
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,795
Let me go, and you'll
never have to work

448
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,296
another day in your life.

449
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:49,736
Yeah.

450
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,303
You know the way
I got it figured,

451
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:58,010
in, prison you oughta make
about, oh, $0.18 cents a day.

452
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,647
Are you as stupid as you look?

453
00:28:01,748 --> 00:28:03,716
Don't you get it?

454
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,484
You're nothing.

455
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:08,420
You're more expendable than me.

456
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,621
And how do you figure that?

457
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:11,023
Simple.

458
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:14,293
The FBI and DEA want
me alive at all costs.

459
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:17,663
And if that cost just
happens to be you,

460
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:21,934
well, another cop dies
in the line of duty.

the way it's gotta be,

that's the way it's gotta be.

My offer still stands.

00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:31,543
I don't take blood money.

00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:32,979
I never killed any
skunk that didn't

damn well deserve to die.

467
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:37,817
I just helped a
skunk kill the skunk.

468

Did the stupid hicks get
lost in their own back yard?

did you do that for?

00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,057
I hear it's hunting season.

I hear it's hunting
season, boys.

484
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,362
I hope you don't mind if
I didn't bring my license.

Ain't exactly what you'd
call a thriving metropolis.

486
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,513
Who cares as long
as they've got food.

487
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:15,447
Well, what do you want?

488
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:19,318
Come on.

489
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,287
Let's go in and eat.

490
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:23,355
I'm going to ask you one
more time, what do you want?

491
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,861
I have to take a
shit, for Christ's sake.

492
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:32,764
God, you're a pain in the ass.

493
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,333
Put up your hands.

Damn, that feels good.

495
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:49,048
I'm glad I could
make you happy.

496
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:51,550
You got an attitude problem.

497
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,584
Tell my therapist about it.

Do you have to stay in here?

511
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:58,350
It's a little hard to take
a shit with an audience.

512

It's was a real
thrill for me too.

There's no goddamned
toilet paper in here.

to come in there

and wipe your ass for you?

There's none in here either.

I think you're right.

1097
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:07,897

He's not calling them.

to have to bluff.

Now you send Montel out first.

No, you let the girl go
and come up the hill alone.
