What stuff? Some trains?

00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:41,320
Yeah,
I dreamt about trains.

37
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:43,322
What can we eat, dad?

00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:46,692
- Hmm?
- What can we eat?

39
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:50,262
How about some cereal?

40
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:52,698
- Oatmeal.
- I want oatmeal.

41
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,899
Oatmeal?

42
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:57,436
Well, I'll take some
of that cereal.

00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,671
You want oatmeal?

- You're hungry?

- Well, we should eat
as soon as it's over.

you little piece of shit?

- Who is aubrey?
- ( babbling )

I'm sorry.
Isaac, shh, please?

65
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,945
Wait a second, so you're--

66
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,213
You're going
through my phone now?

67
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,081
This is fucking crazy.

68
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,084
You have 10 seconds before I rip
your fucking face off.

00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:30,822
( mumbling )

70
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,991
I met her at the grocery store.

71
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,026
- ( babbling )
- isaac.

72
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,362
She came on to me and asked me
if I went to penn state

73
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,164
Because I was wearing
your sweatshirt.

74
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,200
So I said, "no,
it's--it's my friends."

75
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,835
You said it was a friend's?

76
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,972
Well, yes, I mean, bernadette,
it wasn't like that.

77
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:48,273
It was super quick.

78
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,842
Okay, will I see you later?
Yes.

79
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:54,179
- A monster, dada.
- I see the monster.

80
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,981
I'm almost done.

81
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,315
This is so embarrassing.

82
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,184
Woman: Oh, no,
don't worry about it.

83
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,318
- Let's get back on track.
- I'm so sorry, you guys.

84
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,920
Big teeth, dada!

85
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,257
Yeah, look at his big teeth
and I'm almost done.

86
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,460
I'm going to explain
that obviously,

87
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,396
But you keep cutting me off.

88
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,272
Don't look at me like that.

89
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,107
I don't want to talk to you
about this

90
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,142
If you keep looking at me
like that.

91
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,178
Leave.

92
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,080
Baby!

93
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,151
- Okay, pause scene.
- Thank you.

94
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,153
- Great, thank you
so much, mark.
- Mark.

95
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,888
- So second scene?
- No, no, no.

96
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,256
I think we're good.
We got everything we need.

97
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,158
- Okay. Great.
- Yeah.

98
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,927
- Um, really good
to see you, ma'am.
- Of course.

99
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:44,029
-Tamika[ph], great meeting you.
- Hey, nice.

100
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,264
- Amanda, you are unbelievable.
- Thanks.

101
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,033
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

102
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:51,169
I think that you're absolutely
fucking amazing in chloe.

103
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,572
- Okay, thanks.
- And I love this movie,

104
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:56,675
And you're amazing
and this would be amazing.

105
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,009
Anyway, I'm sorry.

106
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,544
Isaac, we should go.
Can you say bye?

107
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:02,013
Can you say bye to amanda?

108
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,748
Can you say, "bye, amanda"?

109
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,385
- Can you say bye to amanda?
- It's okay.

110
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,306
Isaac. Isaac, you're ripping
the whole book.

111
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,774
Yeah.

112
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:35,013
( indistinct chattering )

113
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,363
Isaac: Come to the warship!
Come to the warship!

114
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:55,634
Mark: There's a big wind coming!
( imitates wind gusting )

115
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:59,137
I can fix the sails, buddy.

116
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,373
Oh, the storm's coming.
Fix the sails.

117
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,241
( imitates wind gusting )

118
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,277
Can you put some more gasoline
in there, please?

119
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,779
( imitates wind gusting )

120
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,021
( woman screams )

121
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:19,691
Daddy, there are balloons
floating away.

122
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,293
Whoa!

123
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,698
- The balloons float.
- The balloon is floating.

124
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,400
- Uh, lady.
- Thanks.

125
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,101
She lost the balloon.

126
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:34,105
I'm gonna sing stone the ship.

127
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:38,209
- You wanna help me make dinner?
- Uh, no! No?

128
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,511
No?

129
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:41,513
Nothing.

130
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,348
Nothing.

131
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,333
I'm gonna sit down
and eat with you.

132
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:02,701
Do you want anything to drink?

133
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,703
Yeah, I want a drink.

134
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,237
What color of cup?

135
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:09,441
- Blue, pink, yellow or orange?
- Green.

136
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,176
Green!

137
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,114
Pick a choice.

138
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,584
Yellow!

139
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,322
I'm really thirsty.
Oh.

140
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,393
Okay.

141
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,339
Remember to chew them well,
okay?

142
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,841
Why?

143
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:46,344
'cause if you take two big bites
and just swallow it,

144
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,246
It could get stuck
in your throat.

145
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:52,550
So you chew up with your teeth.
( teeth grinding )

146
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:53,652
Yes.

147
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,420
That's it.

148
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,358
Daddy, I'm done.

149
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,460
You're done?

150
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:07,165
Hey, isaac, can you eat a little
bit more, please?

151
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,601
- No.
- Isaac, you're not finished.

152
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:12,137
Isaac,
you still have more to eat.

153
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,439
But I'm through!
( crying )

154
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:17,108
Isaac, isaac, isaac, isaac,

155
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,743
But I need you
to eat your dinner.

156
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,779
No.

157
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:25,583
Okay, fine.
( sighs )

158
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,622
- I'm gonna eat it then.
- Chew it, dad,

159
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:36,194
And, uh, 'cause if you swallow,
it could stuck in your throat.

160
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,529
So don't do it.

161
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:42,467
Don't swallow it!
( teeth grinding )

162
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,675
Okay, a couple more minutes
and it's time for bed.

163
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:51,776
Ah!

164
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:55,313
( crying )

165
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,817
Okay, it's lights out.

( crying )

168
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,865
Oh, no.
Isaac, come on now.

169
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,433
I'm not playing games right now.

170
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:18,737
Oh, no!
( crying )

171
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,506
Once upon a time,

172
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:25,844
There was a little boy
named isaac,

173
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,713
And he had a spaceship.

174
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:31,883
And isaac started flying up

175
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,786
To the sad broken star.

176
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:40,625
It's time for bed.

177
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,464

What's your favorite food?

190
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:03,908
Is ice cream your favorite food

191
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,311
Or is peanut butter
your favorite food?

192
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:10,348
Peanut butter and crackers
and ice cream.

193
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,482
Yeah.

194
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,920
( giggles )

195
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,122
( sighs )

196
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,565
Is it this park
with the flowers?

197
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,068
Yeah, this park
has a lot of flowers.

198
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,872
Why did you go?
Can we stay at this park?

199
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:37,342
Yeah, we'll stay at this park
for a little bit.

200
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,577
Everywhere.

201
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:40,945
Yeah.

202
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,600
( humming )

203
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,813
Mark: Hey, baby.

204
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,152
( humming continues )

205
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,822
So he's doing pretty good.

206
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:28,660
I'm sure you can see that,
though.

207
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,730
He's talking a lot.

208
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:40,004
It was like overnight,
he just--

209
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,206
He's talking so much now and...

210
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,579
He's such a little man.

211
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,588
Well, if he can...

212
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,636
It's kind of the hardest part
of all these 'cause he doesn't--

213
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,404
He don't know why we're here.

214
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,741
He just knows
it's our special park and, um...

215
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,182
You know, that's what's fucking
killing me about that.

216
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:27,485
( sobbing )

217
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,095
Just one of the few,

218
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:42,166
He gave me a little bit
of...Strength 'cause...

219
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,007
I'm just starting
to feel like...

220
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:52,543
Pretty alone.

221
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,880
- Come on, daddy.
- It's like I don't really
got the energy, you know.

222
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,715
- ( sobs )
- daddy.

223
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:01,786
- Yeah, bud? ( sniffles )
- come on.

224
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:09,827
Thanks.

225
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,934
Are you okay?

226
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,676
Are you okay?

227
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,248
What's wrong?

228
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,619
What's wrong?

229
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,087
Tell daddy what's wrong.

230
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,255
( sobbing )

231
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,623
Are you upset?

232
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,692
( crying )

233
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,242
Okay? What?

234
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,252
45 bucks, that was really good.
Get it?

235
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,522
Hello? Hi. Great.

236
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:12,924
- How are you?
- Thank you.

237
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,525
- What will we buy here?
- Thank you.

238
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,893
Oh, we're not buying anything.

239
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,728
See, all that coins
that we put in there,

240
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,197
- Now we get actual money.
- Oh, right.

241
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,099
Here you go.

242
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,800
Yeah, not bad.
How about yourself?

243
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,202
- Cool.
- Good.

244
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:26,537
Just emptying out
his piggy bank.

245
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:27,839
- Right.
- Yeah.

246
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,674
- There you go.
- Thank you.

247
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:33,978
Look at it, isaac, you got $45.
Cool, thank you.

248
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,314
- Thank you.
- We'll get some ice cream?

249
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,949
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

250
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,017
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

251
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,961
Strawberry

252
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,563
- What?
- All right.

253
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,065
Shit, I'm sorry.

254
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,333
- Hi!
- Woman: How are you?

255
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:58,169
Um, I need a lot of ice cream.

256
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,872
- Okay.
Do you want these on pints?
- Yeah.

257
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,341
- Uh, yeah,
let me just look here.
- Okay.

258
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:07,011
- Honey, strawberry.
- Oh, no.
Oh, it's all in your shoe, bud.

259
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,614
( babbling )

260
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:13,017
- It's kind of like...
- ( screaming )

261
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:17,155
No, no, don't hit--
don't hit daddy.

262
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,590
Don't hit daddy.

263
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:23,694
- Isaac, don't hit...
- Oh, good.

264
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,663
- Okay.
- We need more napkins.

265
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,864
- Are the cones inside?
- Woman: Yes.

266
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:30,635
- Wonderful. Okay.
- ( babbling )

267
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:31,802
( imitates monkey gibbering )

268
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:37,074
- Sorry, just took the last.
- Oh, it's monkey.

269
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,143
- Hmm.
- ( imitates monkey gibbering )

270
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,678
- Oh, monkey.
- ( laughs )

271
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,827
Mark: Hey.

272
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,095
- Mark.
- What's up?

273
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,934
- Having dinner.
- Cool.

274
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,639
- This is juice?
- Yeah.

275
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,741
- Can I get some?
- Sure.

276
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,076
Thanks.

277
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,183
Tim home yet?

278
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,885
Yeah, he's up in his room.

279
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,728
( sighs )

280
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,868
- Hey, tim.
- Tim: Yeah?

281
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,905
- You got a minute, man?
- Yeah.

282
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,742
All right, cool.
I'm in the kitchen with ray.

283
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,044
All right.

284
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,779
I want to talk to you guys
for a second.

285
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,921
- Hey.
- Sit down.

286
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,222
What's up, man?

287
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:04,795
( sighs )
I thought I got some good news.

288
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:08,799
I had an amazing audition
the other day.

289
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,234
Amazing.

290
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,803
There's a huge movie,
shoots in two weeks,

291
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,805
And I feel like I'm definitely
gonna get callbacks

292
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:18,242
So I got something good
on the horizon.

293
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:22,346
And I'm also doing a couple
of other things

294
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:25,216
And I'm probably
gonna have some money

295
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:28,853
To give to you
by the end of this week.

296
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:44,168
Yeah, like hell.

297
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,214
Jason?

298
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:58,816
Hey!

299
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,351
- I'm sorry, man.
- No, no. No problem.

300
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,420
- Hi, mark.
- He is about to pass out.

301
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,989
- Hello?
- Hey, remember jason?

302
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,258
Isaac, remember me?

303
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,461
- He really wants a nap.
- ( laughs )
I know how you feel.

304
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,129
Hey, isaac,
I need a nap too, man.

305
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,197
Jason needs a nap, too.

306
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:15,166
( laughs )

307
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:19,270
- Uh, here's, uh, here's this.
- You're a godsend.

308
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:21,372
- You're saving my life
literally.
- No problem. And I--

309
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:22,807
That was the only one
I could come up with,

310
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,108
Uh, today...

311
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,976
No, no, that's gonna be more
than enough.

312
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,912
- Isaac.
- It's just buy me
a little bit of time

313
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,413
- And then I'm gonna
get this right back.
- Dude...

314
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,315
Who's that handsome guy
in that mirror, huh?

315
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,184
Who's that?

316
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,453
( laughs )

317
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:40,458
- Man, he is a lot bigger.
- You grow an inch every night,
don't you?

318
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,793
- Man.
- How's the show?

319
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,295
It's great, it's great.

320
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:47,131
We have, uh, like we have a lot
of--a lot of stuff today.

321
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:50,134
- I think we're doing
eight-paged.
- You just look great.

322
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:51,869
Thanks!

323
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,505
- Yeah, always get to dress.
- Nice.

324
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,182
Ouch!

325
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,253
Ouchies.

326
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:11,522
Ouchie? Ouchie what?

327
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:15,126
My finger got bited
from my mouth

328
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:17,328
With my teeth.

329
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,164
Your finger got bited
from your mouth with your teeth?

330
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,332
Uh-huh.

331
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,341
( laughter )

332
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,848
Whoa!

333
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,984
- Hey, hello.
- Woman: Hello,

334
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:42,086
- Good, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

335
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:46,590
- Just, uh, this guy.
- All right,

336
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,260
( children laughing )

337
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,995
- They're cool.
- All right, buddy.

338
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:54,899
- ( babbling )

339
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,368
- Take my jacket off.
- Lydia: Hi!

00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,205
Hey.

341
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,209
Ah, the ice cream shop.

342
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:07,077
Hi.

343
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,646

It's nice to meet you.

346
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:13,150
This is crazy.

347
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,686
You have to take off your shoes.

348
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,322
Sorry.

349
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:19,957
This is, uh, for us.

350
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,563
- ( babbling )
- is that your daughter?

351
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:27,131
No, she's at school.

352
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,900
So you just hang out
and keep a look at kids?

353
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:33,237
No, um, it's my place.

354
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,506
- What? This is your place?
- Yeah. Yeah.

355
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:38,309
- Wow, excuse me!
- ( chuckles )

356
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,311
- Stop!
- It's incredible.

357
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:42,580
It's an amazing place.
I really like coming here.

358
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:45,449
It's good to just sit down
and, uh--

359
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:48,319
- And relax
and let them play and...
- Relax, yeah.

360
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,988
- Yeah, we love there.
- Yeah.

361
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,122
I, uh...

362
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,693
Yeah.

363
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,194
Um...

364
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,932
- Okay, you have fun.
- All right.

365
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,667
- Okay.
- It was nice to meet you, mark.

366
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,245
Isaac: What are you doing?

367
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:15,579
Lydia: I'm just looking
at all these pictures

368
00:25:15,581 --> 00:25:17,481
And deciding which ones
to hang up.

369
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:19,483
- You wanna help me?
- I'm driving.

370
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:22,319
Okay, you're driving right now.
You have to focus on the road.

371
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:24,421
I'm trying to focus
on the road.

372
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:27,424
- Yeah.
- You can't tell anybody.

373
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:29,293
I still want to run it back.

374
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,228
- That's a twist.
- Oh, a fruit twist?

375
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,330
- I pick those, too.
- Oh.

376
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,699
- Those are my favorite.
- Really?

377
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,168
See they're sweet, daddy?

378
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,747
I don't know if we can do that
with the real thing.

379
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:52,082
I mean, just maybe a couple
of cooking there.

380
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,450
Lydia: Coffee over there.

381
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:55,252
- Really?
- Yeah.

382
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:58,222
- That'd be great. Thank you.
- How do you take it?

383
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,992
Ah, just like that.

384
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,361
Maybe I'll put some
of this agave in there.

385
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:06,063
- This is great. Thank you.
- Cheers.

386
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,232
All right. Cheers.

387
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,335
How old are you?

388
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:17,207
- ( babbling )
- it will be fun have one
of these in your house.

389
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,342
Mm-hmm, I do.

390
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:20,678
Coming here after hours.
( laughs )

391
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,213
- Bounce around.
- Really party it up.

392
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:25,282
Maybe I'll invite you
to one of my after hours,

393
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:28,085
- Adults-only-bouncy-ball party.
- That'd be amazing.

394
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:34,224
I'm just kidding.
I don't do that.

395
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,127
It'd be fun. Thank you.

396
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,263
I wanna try green.
You can try blue!

397
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,165
You can try blue.

398
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,400
- Well, you want green?
- Mm-hmm.

399
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,169
It's a pretty green, huh?

400
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:46,604
Well, this looks like
a cool color.

401
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:50,240
I think for the color.

402
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:51,575
Okay.

403
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,745
This looks like a cool color.

404
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:56,513
That's my favorite color.

405
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,048
- Red?
- Mm-hmm.

406
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,450
Can I borrow that orange
for a second?

407
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,151
- No.
- No?

408
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:03,053
Can I borrow that black
for a second?

409
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,788
Yeah.

410
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,091
Can I borrow that orange?

411
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:08,325
Yeah.

412
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:11,462
And you borrow my red.
( chuckles )

413
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:15,466
- So do you draw all the dads
and their kids?
- ( chuckles )

414
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,401
No.

415
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,871
It's a no.

416
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:27,177
Sorry, that was stupid.
( chuckles )

417
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,779
No, it wasn't.

418
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,317
This is how they're drawing
the likeness with anybody

419
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,785
In a really long time.

420
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,355
( laughter )

421
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:41,425
( train bell ringing )

422
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,113
Oh, my...

423
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:06,316
It disappeared.

424
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:09,286
Oh, my god!

425
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:11,855
What?

426
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,757
What, daddy?

427
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,592
What, daddy?

428
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,861
They towed our car, isaac.

429
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,266
- ( sneezes )
- bless you.

430
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,605
- Hi.
- Did you forget something?

431
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,407
Um...

432
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,778
- What's wrong?
- Our car got towed.

433
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,749
Oh, sh--
I'm sorry.

434
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:44,421
- Thank you so much.
( sighs )
- mm-hmm.

435
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,890
I feel like such an idiot.

436
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,859
Why?

437
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:50,794
- Oh, it's just like...
- I'm still hot, daddy.

438
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,630
- A lot to put on somebody,
you know?
- Cool.

439
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:57,735
- I'm still hot!
- You're still hot? Okay.

440
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:00,504
Well, we got the air
on full blast.

441
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:03,674
It just takes a second
to get cold, I know.

442
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:06,343
This is an old car.

443
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,611
What kind of car
do you guys have?

444
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,413
Do you know what kind of car
we have, isaac?

445
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,448
- Prius!
- Yeah, prius.

446
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,549
Well, that's nice.
That's--

447
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:15,285
It's, uh, I sold my stuff out.

448
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:18,188
Besides I'm scratched up and...

449
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,624
Sorry if it got towed.

450
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:23,427
Well, it's not your fault.

451
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,696
- ( laughs )
- daddy?

452
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:29,333
- What, bud?
- Are you afraid of snakes?

453
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:30,768
Am I afraid of snakes?

454
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,371
I'm not that afraid
of snakes.

455
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:39,209
- Are you afraid of snakes?
- Mm-mm.

456
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:41,645
- Are you afraid of snakes?
- A little bit, yeah.

457
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:42,846
- You do?
- Yeah.

458
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,314
What did you ask up, buddy?

459
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:45,916
'cause snakes are scary.

460
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:48,719
Oh, you're just thinking
about that?

461
00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:52,689
Some snakes are scary,
but not some.

462
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:55,759
- Sure.
- What are snake noises, daddy?

463
00:29:55,761 --> 00:30:00,364
They go...
( hisses )

464
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,800
- Will you do it again?
- ( chuckles )

465
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:05,302
- ( hisses )
- ( laughs )

466
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,242
How long have you lived here?

467
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:16,680
Um, it's been about, uh...

468
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:18,282
2 1/2 years now.

469
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:21,618
Um, I drove cross country.

470
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,420
- With isaac?
- Mm-hmm.

471
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:26,523
Well, isaac was, uh,
in his mom's tummy then.

472
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:27,691
Oh, okay.

473
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:29,426
- Yeah.
- You guys drove...

474
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,895
She's about eight months
pregnant and, uh...

475
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:35,833
Are you and his mom--
are you still...

476
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,801
We're not together. No.

477
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:39,736
You're not together.
Yeah, yeah.

478
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,007
Um, just to make it

479
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,677
Figuring out a way
to make it work and...

480
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,622
You're doing good.

481
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,536
I'm all right.

482
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:29,019
Dad, why is this car so old?

483
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:30,320
( chuckles )

484
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:33,090
Why is there old--what?

485
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:34,958
Why is there old what?

486
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,327
- Why?
- It is old.

487
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,363
I've had it for a long time.

488
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,698
It's my friend, though.
Oh, here we are.

489
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,335
- Oh.
- Are we here at the mechanic?

490
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,504
- The tow place?
- Yeah. Great.

491
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:49,339
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

492
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,441
- Sure.
- I really, really,
really appreciate it.

493
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:52,876
- Here we are, buddy.
We are here.
- No, please, don't--

494
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:54,411
I didn't mind at all.

495
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,614
It's a break for me
from the chaos.

496
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,952
- Oh, he's so precious.
- Thank you.

497
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:09,793
Well, are your--
all your friends here?

498
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:12,963
Well, the tall guy
is not really a friend.

499
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,800
Do you have a phone?

500
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:19,903
Yeah, I do.
I, you know, I do.

501
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:23,774
Can--I was gonna ask you
if I could give it to you?

502
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:27,044
- Oh, that's good.
- No!

503
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:30,747
Yeah. Uh, let me--
let me give it to you.

504
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,585
Let's see where...

505
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,490
- Hello?
- Man: What can I do for you?

506
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,626
Uh, a friend
just drop me off here.

507
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,061
I'm pretty sure my car
was towed here.

508
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:47,164
- What kind of car?
- It's a black prius.

509
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,865
Yeah, we got it.

510
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:51,001
Okay.

511
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:53,070
It's $480.

512
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:54,805
Jesus fucking christ.

513
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,107
- $480?
- Yes, sir.

514
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:59,743
Is there any way I can pay
a little less than that?

515
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:01,511
- There's no-
- no way.

516
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,480
( mumbling )

517
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,186
( buzzer )

518
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:11,555
Why did they tow it?

519
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,724
They towed it because--

520
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:15,692
I have no fucking idea
why they towed it.

521
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:18,695
We parked in a place that no one
is supposed to park in.

522
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:21,098
Maybe they towed it.

523
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,567
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

524
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:25,035
Oh, no.

525
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:28,805
Thanks, man.

526
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:30,574
Go fuck yourself.

527
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,717
They're pretty here.

528
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,986
We push, push,

529
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:47,524
Push, push, push, push.

530
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:58,268
No!

531
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,572
( imitates train chugging )

532
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:05,242
( grunting )

533
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:07,778
- Ooh.
- ( chuckles )

534
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:15,052
No, don't! Not this one.

535
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,789
Two tattoos.

536
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:21,024
I won't give you two tattoos.

537
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:23,627
There, that one's finished.

538
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:24,895
Do you like that one?

539
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:28,732
- Yeah.
- Okay. What would you like?

540
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,635
A garbage truck and trash can
and garbage can.

541
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:34,938
Whoa, that's a lot.

542
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,874
Garbage truck, a trash pan
and a garbage can?

543
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:41,078
I don't think I can draw
that on your arm.

544
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,181
- Yes.
- Can you think
of something else?

545
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:45,882
No!

546
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,123
Okay.

547
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,028
Here is a garbage truck.

548
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,963
I make the wheels.

549
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:06,002
I make the front part.

550
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:10,040
That's not a garbage truck.
That's a pick-up truck.

551
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:13,176
Now, I'm gonna give you
a tattoo.

552
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:15,212
You're gonna give me a tattoo?

553
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,283
Well, I'm gonna do it
on your forehead.

554
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,119
On my forehead?

555
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,589
I don't want a tattoo
on my forehead.

556
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:27,958
How about my wrist?

557
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,094
Hmm.

558
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,801
- There's a airplane on you.
- You drew an airplane on me?

559
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,269
- Yeah.
- Wow.

560
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:42,172
( humming )

561
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,989
That's okay.

562
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:24,347
( chuckles )
I'm pregnant.

563
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,124
( knocks on door )

564
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,396
-Oh, hi.
- Hi.

565
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:42,866
- Hey. Hi. Hi, what's your name?
- Isabel: Hi.

566
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,868
- Welcome.
- My name is isabel.

567
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,237
- Isabel, I'm mark.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

568
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,772
Nice to meet you.

569
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:52,976
- Oh, my gosh.
- Their flowers are dead.

570
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,746
- ( mumbles )
- lydia: Hmm.

571
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,815
- Perfect.
- Mushy broccoli.

572
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,750
- Melts in your mouth.
- Mm-hmm.

573
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,852
Let me draw
on this paper right here

574
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:04,120
And you draw right here.

575
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:07,657
You know the table is good.

576
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:11,361
We should write right here
because you can draw right here.

577
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,063
I set up.

578
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,265
You wanna put some of these
down here

579
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:17,434
So you can move around here.

580
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:19,369
- Here.
- Mark: Are you gonna have one?

581
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,338
- Lydia: Maybe.
- Okay.

582
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,341
I'll have one
if you'll have one later.

583
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:26,209
- So I'll have orange juice now.
- Follower.

584
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:27,377
- Can I have some more?
- Yeah.

585
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:28,945
Isabel,
you look very lovely tonight.

586
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,381
You do, you look amazing,
isabel.

587
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:33,917
- You did good, girl.
- Thank you, mommy?

588
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,453
If I would have known, I would
have come more coordinated.

589
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,255
- Huh?
- ( chuckles ) yes.

590
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:41,157
Because the guys wearing like
this would have him in sweater.

591
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,795
- ( isaac crying )
- it's cranky time.

592
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,430
Do you want macaroni and cheese?
Do you like macaroni and cheese?

593
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,966
Isabel: It's the only thing
we have, too.

594
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:52,836
No, we have this other stuff
that you're not gonna like.

595
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,804
So that's why I made macaroni
and cheese.

596
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,873
- Oh, macaroni and cheese.
- Same old story.

597
00:37:56,875 --> 00:38:00,310
- Is that what you want?
- Oops.

598
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:02,479
- Mama.
- Lydia.

599
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:04,214
- Mama.
- Lydia.

600
00:38:04,216 --> 00:38:06,182
- Mama.
- Lydia.

601
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,417
Thank you.

602
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:08,785
On a scale of 1 to 10,

603
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,121
How much do you love
being a parent?

604
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:13,123
- Um...
- Right now.

605
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,325
- Right now?
- ( chuckles )

606
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:19,162
- I'm just gonna keep
that to myself. Yeah.
- Okay.

607
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:21,231
This is like the best thing I've
ever eaten in my entire life.

608
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:24,000
- It makes it yummy.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

609
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:27,404
- It's very yummy, isn't it?
- Do you feel better now
that you're eating?

610
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,274
- Mm-hmm.
- I feel bad.

611
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:33,276
What?

612
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:37,280
I said to mama
I don't feel good.

613
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:38,815
Hmm.

614
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,388
Looks cute.

615
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:56,066
- ( laughs )
- hey, what's so funny?

616
00:38:56,068 --> 00:38:58,468
I don't know.
What's so funny, babel[ph], huh?

617
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,203
Thank you. Huh?

618
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:04,541
I'm just thinking
of he said mama. ( chuckles )

619
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:08,912
- Oh.
- It happens all the time.

620
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,046
Hey, I'm a mama.

621
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:12,515
Daddy is looking for a worm.

622
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,317
If daddy gets some worm,
I'm gonna win.

623
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,919
- Lydia: Duck!
- I knew you were
gonna get that?

624
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:19,222
- How?
- I do just tell in my mind.

625
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:20,857
- Do you want to play again?
- Sure, let's do it.

626
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,126
Do you want to play again?

627
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:24,394
Oh, yeah,
unless more a wine?

628
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:27,197
- Yeah.
- That's it.

629
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,166
Isabel: That's fun.
Did you guys have fun?

630
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,435
- It's a lot of fun. Thank you.
- Sure.

631
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,304
I want the worm.

632
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:37,440
- One more to go, chicken.
- I have the worm.

633
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:40,510
Hey! Hey, you? Yes, mark?

634
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,846
- Yeah.
- Mark, I was the one
who had the worm.

635
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,013
Thank you.

636
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:46,950
- Welcome.
- Now, you get to...

637
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:49,586
- An apple.
- Yummy apple.

638
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:52,155
- You need to get it
from the same.
- Yummy apple.

639
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:56,092
- ( mumbles )
- they're really gonna go along?

640
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:59,329
She's an angel.

641
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:04,868
I think--I was worried
of the age difference.

642
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,070
- House and ball?
- Ball. Ball.

643
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,172
- Oh!
- A house.

644
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:12,942
"you do just what the list
says," said mrs. Rogers.

645
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:15,578
And mrs. Rogers got into the car
with mr. Rogers

646
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,113
And they drove away.

647
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,182
Who's gonna have that pie?

648
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:21,251
I don't know.
I wanna eat it.

649
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:23,253
I think I'm gonna have it.

650
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,954
These are drawings.

651
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:27,390
( laughter )

652
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:31,227
- This is drawing.
- It is just a drawing.

653
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:34,230
- We're not drawing.
- He's so cute.

654
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:36,399
We're not drawings.

655
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:38,067
We're not drawings.

656
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,471
We're not drawings?

657
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:43,206
We're not?

658
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,241
- Mm.
- I thought we were.

659
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:47,143
- No.
- No?

660
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:48,411
No.

661
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:51,147
Oh, you taught me
something today.

662
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:54,417
Mark: Once upon a time, there
was a little boy named isaac

663
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:58,988
- And he was isaac the dreamer.
- ( yawns )

664
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:03,927
He made everybody's dreams
come true.

665
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:08,932
So one night,
he saw lydia sleeping

666
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:12,001
And lydia was dreaming about...

667
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,572
( chuckles )

668
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:19,576
Oh!

669
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:24,013
( laughs ) I hope isaac
is a deep sleeper.

670
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:27,584
( laughs )

671
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:31,054
I just don't like her
a hurricane.

672
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:32,522
( chuckles )

673
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:35,592
( music playing over player )

674
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,403
- Hi.
- Hi.

675
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,341
How are you doing?

676
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,377
I'm okay.

677
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,780
Where are you from?

678
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,651
I'm from sacramento.

679
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,288
Where are you from?

680
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,323
- Philadelphia.
- Oh.

681
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,960
Thanks for having me over.

682
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:13,029
Sure.

683
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,065
( sighs )

684
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,669
Sure.

685
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:26,643
- Did you just put that on
'cause you're nervous?
- Oh, not really.

686
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,182
Yeah.

687
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:36,252
( music playing over player )

688
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,582
I love you.

689
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,319
I love you so much.

690
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,156
I wanna marry you.

691
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:15,758
Will you marry me?

692
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,828
Mm. Oh, I feel better.

693
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,769
All right. Okay. Okay. O
kay.

694
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,106
What?

695
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,310
Nothing, just--I just hold on.

696
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:37,680
Oh.

697
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:40,583
Oh.

698
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,821
- No.
- Oh, god, I'm sorry.

699
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,491
Fuck!

700
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,264
- Thanks.
- Sure.

701
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:10,713
- Oh.
- Are you drunk?

702
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:12,749
Did you get--
did you drink too much?

703
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:15,618
I just want you to feel not bad.

704
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,753
I don't--

705
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:22,191
I feel...Bad.

706
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:24,761
I feel bad.

707
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:27,163
I don't feel sorry.

708
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,665
I should go.

709
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:31,234
I should probably get him home.

710
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:33,469
What just happened?

711
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:39,442
I should get him home

712
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:40,643
Well, okay.

714
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:46,616
Um, are you sure?

715

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

717

Okay.

718
00:44:52,257 --> 00:44:54,490

You wanna get out of it.

723
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:11,708
All right. All right.

724
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,449

Whoa. Whoa.

729
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:33,930
Whoa, look at that fish.

730
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:35,932
Goldfish!

731
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:37,400
- Whoa!
- A goldfish.

732
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:39,402
That's a big goldfish.

733
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:41,671
That's a little too big for us.

734
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,175
Oh, there we go.

735
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:47,410
Look at that.

736
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:50,947
Well, that's a lot of them.
Whoa.

737
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:53,850
Touch it and they move.

738
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:58,254
Think you can pick one of them
out of there and be your pet?

739
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:02,191
Which one?

740
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:04,260
Yeah, very first goldfish.

741
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,469
Any one in particular or...

742
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:14,871
- ( laughs )
- anything is fine.

743
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:18,808
Whoa, look at that.

744
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,649
Wow!

745
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:28,217
That's perfect.

746
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:31,354
- What should we name her?
- Isaac: Daddy.

747
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:33,856
You want to name her daddy?

748
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:39,295
- Okay. That's a good name.
- No.

749
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:43,266
Yes, we can build a house
for her at home.

750
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:45,635
Yeah, we're gonna build you
a house at home,

751
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:48,638
And your name is now--
what is it?

752
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,474
- Daddy!
- Daddy, your name is daddy.

753
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,242
We love you, daddy.

754
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:57,446
So we got to remember,
we got to feed daddy every day.

755
00:46:57,448 --> 00:47:00,249
- The fish, not you.
- Yeah, the fish.

756
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:02,018
- Not you.
- Not me.

757
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,253
We have to talk to her.

758
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:06,923
Why is she--
we have to talk to her?

759
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:09,525
So that--so she stays happy.

760
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:10,827
We've got to keep...

761
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:13,963
Keep daddy happy.

762
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,834
She's sad right now.

763
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:19,602
She's sad right now?

764
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:21,704
Yeah, 'cause she's
in this plastic bag, huh?

765
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:23,673
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

766
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:25,608
Are you talking to me?
You're talking to the fish?

767
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:31,380
You talking to daddy the fish
or daddy your dad?

768
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:34,750
- Daddy the dad.
- Okay, yes?

769
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:39,522
What's the fish's name again?

770
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:40,656
You named it.

771
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:42,859
- Daddy.
- ( chuckles ) yeah.

772
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:46,562
That's right.

773
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:49,966
I'm gonna name her mama now.

774
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,769
I'm gonna name her mommy.

775
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:55,605
You'll name her mommy.

776
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:07,516
I will name her mommy!

777
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:10,553
I named her mommy, daddy.

778
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:12,722
- You did?
- Yeah.

779
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:15,391
- Mommy.
- I like the name daddy.

780
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,595
Let's keep it daddy, okay?

781
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:20,963
What?

782
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:22,632
Let's keep
the fish's name daddy.

783
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:23,933
Why?

784
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:25,468
'cause that was
the original name.

785
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,336
We should stick
with the original name.

786
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:29,605
No, mama!

787
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,547
Hold the fishbowl.

788
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:39,682
Hold it.

789
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:41,751
Okay, that's good.

790
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,160
- There she went!
- Look at her.

791
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:54,964
Give some give food.

792
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:56,899
Yeah, are you gonna feed her?

793
00:48:56,901 --> 00:48:59,402
Yeah, I'm gonna feed her.

794
00:48:59,404 --> 00:49:01,704
I like feeding stuff.

795
00:49:01,706 --> 00:49:03,539
For sure.

796
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:06,042
- I can do it, daddy.
- Okay, just a little.

797
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:08,411
Just take just a little bit,
a little pinch. Pinch.

798
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:11,514
That's--
are those chips?

799
00:49:11,516 --> 00:49:12,982
Those are fish chips.

800
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:15,751
Yeah, she's gonna love that.

801
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,055
See, she's eating it already.

802
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:21,857
Look, can you see?

803
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,963

804
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:28,898
- Yeah.
- ( chuckles )

805
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,401
- ( squeaking )
- I think you're
gonna eat me, daddy.

806
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:34,503
- I'm gonna eat you.
- No!

807
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:35,838
Don't eat me!

808
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,840

- He's very smart.
- Did you got, like,
baby einstein show with him?

875
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,880
No, I made him lots
of flat seats.

876
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:40,783
- I got a little dressed up.
- Yeah, you're making me feel
like crashing as well.

877
00:53:40,785 --> 00:53:42,818
- Cheers, man.
- Yeah.

878
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,154
- Like I haven't seen you
so long.
- I know, dude.

879
00:53:45,156 --> 00:53:47,856
I think I'm gonna be doing
Paul Thomas Anderson's movie.

880
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:50,125
Uh, ryan gosling
and james franco.

881
00:53:50,127 --> 00:53:53,062
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No, man.

882
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:54,663
PT Anderson's movie.

883
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:57,132
- Man: That is incredible.
- Yeah.

884
00:53:57,134 --> 00:54:01,337
- Yeah, and james franco.
With ryan gosling.
- This guy is here.

885
00:54:01,339 --> 00:54:03,138
- Yeah.
- You're having red?

886
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,406
- You're sticking
around tonight?
- Yeah.

887
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,075
- Right.
- Boy, your teeth got...

888
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:08,010
- Bruised.
- ( chuckles )

889
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:10,045
That's great 'cause if you spill
on your shirt, you'll...

890
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:13,115
( piano playing )
( sighs )

891
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:28,063
Think it was like...
( piano plays )

892
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,735
Right?

893
00:54:32,737 --> 00:54:37,072
( piano plays )

894
00:54:37,074 --> 00:54:39,041
Michael, I'm gonna get next.

895
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:41,043
- What?
- I'm gonna get next.

896
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:42,945
- Both?
- ( chuckles )

897
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:45,281
Okay, who wants to go
in the balcony?

898
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:46,982
Who wants to go take a look
at the city?

899
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:49,051
- I wanted to go to the city.
- Breathe some air.

900
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:52,388
- They only make it in melanie.
- It looked like a cheese wheel.

901
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,823
- Hmm.
- Ramos.

902
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:56,191
Just--
oh, so we have to split one.

903
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:59,395
- No, please.
- No.

904
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:01,397
- Don't, uh...
- I'm not going over there.

905
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:03,832
You know, crazy things
can happen here tonight

906
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:05,501
'cause there's no railing,
if you'll notice.

907
00:55:05,503 --> 00:55:08,037
- Michael, stop it!
- ( chuckles )

908
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:10,806
- Man: We have a bar or, uh...
- 'cause crazy things
happen here every night.

909
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:13,475
- Woman: Absolutely.
- Everybody,
form a circle around mark.

910
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:16,545
( indistinct chattering )

911
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,382
- Go, go, go.
- Give her a tail.

912
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:21,984
- Give her a tail.
- ( woman laughs )

913
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:24,186
- Give her a tail.
- Whoo!

914
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:30,926
Okay. $2,000.

915
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:32,328
Oh, my god!

916
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:35,164
For $2,000, anyone who put--
puts this here

917
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,166
- And pulls the trigger.
- ( laughs )

918
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:38,901
I dare you. No, no, no.

919
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:40,269
Really think about it.

920
00:55:40,271 --> 00:55:41,837
There's $2,000.

921
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,305
I'll give you 2,000--

922
00:55:43,307 --> 00:55:45,140
There.

923
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:46,775
In fact, here's the clip.

924
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:48,177
There's the clip.
$2,000.

925
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:50,012
- No, don't do it.
- Give me 4,000.

926
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:52,414
But you have to promise me
that you'll take 10 seconds

927
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:53,982
- To think about it.
- Okay.

928
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:55,951
And we have--
no, slower, slower, slower.

929
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:57,519
Really think about it.
Really think about it.

930
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,021
Let me say the password.

931
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:02,624
( laughter )

932
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,464
( laughter )

933
00:56:08,466 --> 00:56:10,132
♪ I love my life

934
00:56:10,134 --> 00:56:15,070
( laughter )
woman: We love it!

935
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:16,905
- ♪ I love my...
- Michael, no!

936
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:25,214
( indistinct chattering )

937
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:27,816
Mike, you should really spend
for a railing around here.

938
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:31,854
Yeah, $80,000.
Maybe you could spend for it.

939
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:34,456
- Really?
- And that's for
the cheapest grade of aluminum.

940
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:36,825
( laughter )
so I can't fucking do it.

941
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:39,094
And if I got one,
it couldn't not be marble.

942
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,234
( thuds )

943
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:47,202
That is the best way to blow
your imaginary balls out.

944
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:49,238
Does that make you
more comfortable?

945
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,340
- Man: There could be one
in the chamber.
- Is--is mark okay?

946
00:56:51,342 --> 00:56:54,943
- Yeah, he's, uh,
getting it another.
- Why is he being sick?

947
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:57,479
- Yeah, he's...
- Not too well.

948
00:56:57,481 --> 00:56:59,348
Talking about the strange one,
you know.

949
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:03,118
- Where is he? You okay, buddy?
- So yeah, I'm gonna sit down.

950
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,253
Hey, where are you going?

951
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,387
Hey, where are you going?

952
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:08,891
( laughs )
hey, where are you going?

953
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:11,126
- Where are you going, man?
- I was gonna sit--
I'm gonna sit down.

954
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:13,929
- I'm not gonna lay down.
I'm gonna sit down.
- You need anything?

955
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,098
- You want any medicine?
- I'm fucking great.

956
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,167
- Water?
- No.

957
00:57:18,169 --> 00:57:20,536
Just some water, dude.

958
00:57:20,538 --> 00:57:23,372
- Damn. Fucking over!
- ( man hums )

959
00:57:23,374 --> 00:57:25,974
- Brian.
- All night.

960
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:27,876
- Asshole.
- All night.

961
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:30,345
- Unlucky charm man.
- Let me watch--
this is how you--

962
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:32,448
- You're my unlucky charm man.
- How I'm gonna get it in there?

963
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:35,284
Okay, well,
it doesn't really matter now.

964
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:36,485
No,
we haven't started boulder dash.

965
00:57:36,487 --> 00:57:38,320
We're gonna play
in a few minutes.

966
00:57:38,322 --> 00:57:41,156
- Do you know these people?
- No, I don't think I do.

967
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:42,558
Okay, I'll introduce you
to people.

968
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,427
- Hey, everyone,
this is Jocelin.
- Hi!

969
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:47,529
People are ready, yeah.
That's jo--

970
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:50,032
- You guys know Jocelin?
- Nice to meet you, guys.

971
00:57:50,034 --> 00:57:53,135
- Oh, my god.
- Mark?

972
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:55,637
- Hi.
- Oh, my god!

973
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:58,240
What are you doing?
What are you doing here?

974
00:57:58,242 --> 00:58:00,375
- You're really close
to this guy?
- How do you know each other?

975
00:58:00,377 --> 00:58:02,344
- We...
- We know each other
from new york.

976
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:03,445
- Yeah.
- No way.

977
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:04,680
- Yeah, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

978
00:58:04,682 --> 00:58:06,315
It's been a hot minute.

979
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:09,318
Gurning,
a german wheelbarrow.

980
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,520
( laughter )

981
00:58:11,522 --> 00:58:15,057
Gurning. Okay,
we got a lot more. A lot more.

982
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:18,460
Yearning for a gur noise.

983
00:58:18,462 --> 00:58:23,332
Gurning, a ride to the hospital
on a gurney.

984
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:24,500
( laughter )

985
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:27,102
( indistinct chatter )

986
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:29,438
It could be.

987
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,641
Gurning, a french camera doll...

988
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,601
( sighs )

989
00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:35,771
- Good to see you.
- It was good to see you.

990
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:40,142
It's like...

991
00:59:40,144 --> 00:59:44,012
What happened with us?

992
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:45,681
I don't know. We were good.

993
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:47,749
You were so good.

994
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:52,421
You were so good.

995
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:54,089
I feel like I messed it up.

996
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:57,593
No, you just kind of moved.

997
00:59:57,595 --> 01:00:00,462
Yeah. Yeah.

998
01:00:00,464 --> 01:00:01,797
I mean, it's the right thing,
you know.

999
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:04,266
You're--you're making moves.

1000
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:06,568
- Now you're here.
- Mm-hmm. ( chuckles )

1001
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,704
Now.

1002
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:10,238
I just...

1003
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:25,354
Do you have a boyfriend?

1004
01:00:25,356 --> 01:00:27,389
I don't.

1005
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:29,558
- Well, neither do I.
- You don't?

1006
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,660
- No.
- Oh. ( laughs )

1007
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:35,697
You should move out here.

1008
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:39,234
Mm, well...

1009
01:00:39,236 --> 01:00:42,771
I know it's cliche, but I don't
know about the driving.

1010
01:00:42,773 --> 01:00:45,140
Hmm, you know,
that's what everybody says,

1011
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:49,611
But it really is kind of nice
to see your own little bubble

1012
01:00:49,613 --> 01:00:52,147
And it's just kind of good to
be--have your own little bubble

1013
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:53,482
And just getting your bubble

1014
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:56,451
And the bubble takes you
to the next little thing

1015
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:58,754
And then you--

1016
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:00,656
- I like the bubble.
- Yeah?

1017
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:02,591
Hmm. Hmm.

1018
01:01:02,593 --> 01:01:07,462
I mean, the train
is so...Stupid.

1019
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:09,865
- No, it's not.
- The train is so stupid.

1020
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:13,301
- Public transportation
is not stupid.
- Do you like the train?

1021
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:14,636
I like the train.

1022
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:16,438
- You still like the train.
- Mm-hmm.

1023
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:20,509
Oh, I have something to say.

1024
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:23,645
- ( laughs )
- I would say...

1025
01:01:23,647 --> 01:01:25,447
I love you.

1026
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:30,886
How much do you love me?

1027
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:34,856
Up to the room in the back.

1028
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:37,492
- I love you.
- How much do you love me?

1029
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:38,794
To infinity and back.

1030
01:01:38,796 --> 01:01:41,730
My god, I am still in love you.

1031
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:45,267
- No, you're not.
- I am. I love you so much.

1032
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,871
Where did you hear?
This is I love you.

1033
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:53,375
( giggles )
oh, you don't.

1034
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:57,145
Can I just kiss you one time,
please?

1035
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:58,480
One time.

1036
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:04,619
That didn't count.

1037
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,647
I love you.

1038
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:38,320
I love you.

1039
01:02:38,322 --> 01:02:40,589
I've missed you.

1040
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:42,824
I wish we get married.

1041
01:02:42,826 --> 01:02:46,361
( giggles )

1042
01:02:46,363 --> 01:02:48,697
Do you wanna have kids?

1043
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:50,599
Whoa. ( giggles )

1044
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:53,435
Not right now.

1045
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:55,437
I have a kid. I have a kid.

1046
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:57,606
- Hmm?
- I have a kid.

1047
01:02:57,608 --> 01:02:59,307
You have a kid?

1048
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,578
- Mark, you have a kid?
- Yeah.

1049
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:07,315
Since when?

1050
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:12,254
Since--what?

1051
01:03:12,256 --> 01:03:14,623
Since...

1052
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:16,658
He's 2 years.

1053
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:17,826
Whoa!

1054
01:03:17,828 --> 01:03:19,961
I thought we we're catching up.

1055
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,264
Yeah. What?

1056
01:03:22,266 --> 01:03:23,932
Oh.

1057
01:03:23,934 --> 01:03:25,901
I remember it, mark.

1058
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:31,239
It's...Not that big a deal.

1059
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:33,975
Um, it's a big deal.

1060
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:39,514
- Why?
- ( sighs )

1061
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:42,584
- Listen, I came out...
- Mark, it was--

1062
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:44,019
No, that came out wrong.

1063
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:46,621
- No, Jocelin, listen to me, I--
- no, it's just--

1064
01:03:46,623 --> 01:03:48,857
( sighs )

1065
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:50,826
Look, it was great
to see you again, okay?

1066
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:52,327
I just--

1067
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,796
We need to talk
and actually catch up,

1068
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:58,600
But...I feel weird about this.

1069
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:02,737
Call me, okay?

1070
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:12,480
Fuck!

1071
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,019
Woman: Hello.

1072
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:58,526
Hello.

1073
01:04:58,528 --> 01:04:59,861
- Hi, maria.
- ( sighs )

1074
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:02,931
I am so sorry.
Hi, buddy! I've got cookies!

1075
01:05:02,933 --> 01:05:05,834
- I just went to the store
for the cookies.
- ( speaks spanish )

1076
01:05:05,836 --> 01:05:07,068
Oh.

1077
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:11,873
Please, there's extra, extra.

1078
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:13,775
I am so sorry.

1079
01:05:13,777 --> 01:05:15,777
- ( whines )
- thank you.

1080
01:05:15,779 --> 01:05:18,013
- Huh?
- I'm peeing my pants.

1081
01:05:18,015 --> 01:05:19,948
Oh, you got to pee?
Well, let's go pee.

1082
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:21,483
- Thank you.
- No, I just peed.

1083
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:23,752
- You just peed a little? Okay.
- ( mumbles )

1084
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:24,853
All right, thank you.

1085
01:05:24,855 --> 01:05:27,622
- Adios.
- Adios.

1086
01:05:27,624 --> 01:05:28,757
I peed here.

1087
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:30,959
You peed there?

1088
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:34,396
I named her mommy.

1089
01:05:34,398 --> 01:05:36,131
I named her mommy.

1090
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:37,766
I thought you named her daddy.

1091
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:41,136
- Mommy!
- Where is the fish food?

1092
01:05:41,138 --> 01:05:43,571
Okay, that is too much.
That's too much.

1093
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:45,140
That's...

1094
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:46,808
That's a lot.

1095
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:51,880
Is she eating it?

1096
01:05:51,882 --> 01:05:54,950
Yeah! Yeah, daddy!

1097
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:56,518
She eats, daddy!

1098
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,686
- Oh.
- She eats!

1099
01:05:57,688 --> 01:05:59,621
Look.

1100
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:02,557
- She doesn't make noise.
- We can't really hear them.

1101
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,092
I mean, they make noise,
but they're under water

1102
01:06:04,094 --> 01:06:06,528
So it's hard to hear them.

1103
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:09,597
If we're underwater,
you can hear them?

1104
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,967
- Hmm.
- We're not underwater.

1105
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:14,069
Yeah.

1106
01:06:14,071 --> 01:06:16,137
But when they're underwater.

1107
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:21,443
Hey, hey!
I'm so glad we could talk.

1108
01:06:21,445 --> 01:06:23,511
Do you have a minute
right now?

1109
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:26,681
Okay.

1110
01:06:26,683 --> 01:06:29,484
Well, I just--I wanted to...

1111
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:35,190
I wanted to apologize
for the other night

1112
01:06:35,192 --> 01:06:39,694
And I was wondering
if I can have an opportunity

1113
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:44,766
To see you again today
and--and just talk.

1114
01:06:56,712 --> 01:07:00,048
I need you!
I need you, daddy.

1115
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:03,151
I need you.

1116
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:06,187
But I didn't sleep yet.

1117
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:07,989
Can I sleep for five minutes?

1118
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:10,158
- No!
- Please?

1119
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,193
No!

1120
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:13,595
( children frolicking )

1121
01:07:13,597 --> 01:07:15,630
( baby crying )

1122
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:18,700
That baby's crying.

1123
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:21,469
She's--her dad--
I wonder if she's okay.

1124
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,838
Why is she crying?

1125
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,641
I don't know.
She's upset about something.

1126
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:31,846
Hey, daddy's friends are here.

1127
01:07:31,848 --> 01:07:33,748
- Hey, babel[ph].
- Isabel: Hi!

1128
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,050
- How are you?
- Good.

1129
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:36,684
Good. Good to see you.

1130
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:38,620
- Hi. Hi, these are for you.
- Hi.

1131
01:07:38,622 --> 01:07:40,488
Oh, thank you. This is...

1132
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,557
Isaac's over there.

1133
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:46,694
Um, can we sit down
and talk for a second?

1134
01:07:46,696 --> 01:07:48,296
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1135
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:52,867
Hey, isaac, lydia is here.

1136
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:56,271
Hi, isaac.

1137
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:00,975
You're gonna keep digging?

1138
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:03,812
( laughter )

1139
01:08:03,814 --> 01:08:08,049
Careful. Wow!
Wow.

1140
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:09,918
How's your day going?

1141
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,253
Good. Tired.

1142
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:13,555
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1143
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:14,823
- Consumed.
- Yeah.

1144
01:08:14,825 --> 01:08:16,791
( sighs )

1145
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:19,594
You're just not have the energy.

1146
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,197
- ( laughs )
- ( chuckles ) it's like--

1147
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:23,832
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah.

1148
01:08:23,834 --> 01:08:25,066
It's really good to see you.

1149
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:29,737
I...Wanna apologize
for the other night.

1150
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:32,140
I was...

1151
01:08:32,142 --> 01:08:34,242
I was a bit much.

1152
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,679
Oh, it was a lot.

1153
01:08:37,681 --> 01:08:39,914
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

1154
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,285
Okay.

1155
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:50,825
I haven't been,
uh, entirely honest

1156
01:08:50,827 --> 01:08:53,995
With you, and, uh...

1157
01:08:57,099 --> 01:09:01,703
( isaac screaming )

1158
01:09:01,705 --> 01:09:03,138
Uh...

1159
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,074
Hey.

1160
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:11,246
Uh, when isaac was a year old,

1161
01:09:11,248 --> 01:09:12,914
I was, uh--

1162
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,618
So, when he was just
about a year old,

1163
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,920
I was sitting with him
on a the bouncing ball,

1164
01:09:18,922 --> 01:09:23,258
Like one of those exercise balls
in our apartment in beachwood.

1165
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,792
Okay.

1166
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:26,161
And it was really early
in the morning

1167
01:09:26,163 --> 01:09:29,164
And I was really upset

1168
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:31,299
Because he'd been up
the whole night before.

1169
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:33,334
He didn't sleep.

1170
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:38,940
And his mom had to go.

1171
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:43,144
Then she went to kiss me

1172
01:09:43,146 --> 01:09:47,682
And I didn't kiss her back
'cause I...

1173
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:53,121
And she got in a car accident.

1174
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:03,164
Car in the carpool lane,

1175
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:06,034
Clipped the motorcycle

1176
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:07,368
And the motorcycle...

1177
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:11,406
Went to her lane
and her car flipped...

1178
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:16,377
And then snapped her neck
and she died on impact.

1179
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:23,318
Daddy,
I'm digging for treasure.

1180
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,853
I'm digging for treasure!

1181
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:28,990
( sighs )

1182
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:59,754
So, I'm a mess
and, uh...

1183
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:02,957
I shouldn't touch you
with 10-foot pole.

1184
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:05,193
- ( chuckles )
- yeah.

1185
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:15,903
( snoring )

1186
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:28,916
( gasps )

1187
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:33,021
- Hey.
- Sorry.

1188
01:11:33,023 --> 01:11:35,723
- Sorry to wake you.
- Sorry, are you gonna watch tv?

1189
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:38,559
- No, no, no.
- Oh.

1190
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:41,396
Okay, what's up, man?

1191
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:42,497
Shit.

1192
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:44,565
Oh, what time is it?

1193
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:51,906
Okay.

1194
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:57,945
- Some news, I just needed
to tell you right away.
- What's going on?

1195
01:11:57,947 --> 01:12:02,083
Um, I found someone else
to--to take your room,

1196
01:12:02,085 --> 01:12:07,088
So I have to have you out
by the end of the month.

1197
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:09,490
I'm really sorry, mark.

1198
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:12,794
It's just, everything,
it's too much.

1199
01:12:12,796 --> 01:12:16,931
Why, I--I told you I was getting
everything sort a bit.

1200
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:21,235
I know, man,
but I just can't afford it.

1201
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:25,239
We'll help you,
whatever you need.

1202
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:29,143
Okay, well,
this isn't...Helping me.

1203
01:12:29,145 --> 01:12:30,945
This isn't helpful.

1204
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:36,517
I -I told you
that I'm getting money together.

1205
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:39,854
You owe me so much money, man.
It's not happening.

1206
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:46,394
I have to, you know,
so I could come pay the rent.

1207
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:50,965
You're gonna kick me
and isaac out in the street?

1208
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:53,000
Come on, man.
I feel fucked up already.

1209
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:55,937
- If there's anything--
- this is fucking ridiculous,
man!

1210
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:57,939
You can't just
fucking kick me out.

1211
01:12:57,941 --> 01:12:59,807
We don't--we don't wanna do this
but...

1212
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:01,442
Yeah,
but you're fucking doing it.

1213
01:13:01,444 --> 01:13:03,978
I mean, you guys, you got
to give me a fucking chance

1214
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:06,080
- To give you the money that
I said I was gonna give you.
- It's been months.

1215
01:13:06,082 --> 01:13:07,515
Months, mark.

1216
01:13:07,517 --> 01:13:09,917
I've paid your rent
out of my own pocket.

1217
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:11,185
You have the rest
of the month, man.

1218
01:13:11,187 --> 01:13:14,922
You got, like,
I don't know, two weeks.

1219
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:16,991
I can't believe
you guys are doing this.

1220
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:19,927
Maybe we could find
some place more--

1221
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:22,130
You know, maybe some place
more affordable for you,

1222
01:13:22,132 --> 01:13:24,031
Even better for--for isaac.

1223
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,840
You're a fucking piece of shit.

1224
01:13:32,842 --> 01:13:35,009
And you're fucking piece
of shit!

1225
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,313

1226
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:52,593

1228
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:03,004

It's okay. ( shushes )

1234
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:30,398
It's okay.

1235
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,999
You don't have to go.

1236
01:14:32,001 --> 01:14:33,634
Shut the fuck up!

1237
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:36,704

- ( crying )

1238
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:51,452

1239
01:14:51,454 --> 01:14:55,156
- We're going out.
- ( crying continues )

1240
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:58,025
( shushes )

1241
01:14:58,027 --> 01:15:01,329
- It's okay.
- Stop it!

1242
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:06,033
- ( shushes )
- no!

1243
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:10,671
No! ( crying )

1244
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:55,216
We'll go, uh, night picnic,
okay?

1245
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:06,727
( breathing heavily )

1246
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:16,737
Big crack.

1247
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:21,008
What?

1248
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:22,677
Yeah.

1249
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:24,645
What's a big crack?

1250
01:16:24,647 --> 01:16:27,248
- There was a big crack there.
- Where?

1251
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,550
When we stepped over.

1252
01:16:29,552 --> 01:16:31,419
Where?

1253
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:35,156
Right back over there.

1254
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:37,024
You see?

1255
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:38,593
Look at the moon.

1256
01:16:38,595 --> 01:16:40,494
You see the moon out there?

1257
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:46,567
We're gonna go camping tonight.

1258
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:49,070
- This is my tent.
- Yeah.

1259
01:16:49,072 --> 01:16:53,274
This is really cool right here,
huh?

1260
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:55,443
- ( mumbles )
- yeah.

1261
01:16:55,445 --> 01:16:58,279
I think we could sleep out here,
huh?

1262
01:16:58,281 --> 01:16:59,747
What do you think?

1263
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,652
Let's try it.

1264
01:17:04,654 --> 01:17:07,355
Yeah, get on the pillow.

1265
01:17:07,357 --> 01:17:09,824
Yeah.
Here you go, bud.

1266
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:29,243
( babbling )

1267
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:44,291
I don't know if this is
such a good idea, isaac.

1280
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:22,569
Because--I took them out
so you can put them back in.

1281
01:22:22,571 --> 01:22:26,740

I need to turn on the water.

doesn't feel good anymore.

Mark:
Something happened to her.

1286
01:22:52,935 --> 01:22:54,802
What?

1287
01:22:54,804 --> 01:22:56,770
It's called dying.

1288
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:01,642
What's dying?

1289
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:06,080
Dying are when things
stop living.

1290
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,616
You see, she's not moving.

1291
01:23:09,618 --> 01:23:11,018
Why?

1292
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:14,088
Why, dada?

1293
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:20,127
There's something called life

1294
01:23:20,129 --> 01:23:23,163
And something called death.

1295
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:24,698
Do you know
what those things are?

1296
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:27,034
- Mm-hmm.
- You do?

1297
01:23:27,036 --> 01:23:30,137
Can you tell me
what you think those things are?

1298
01:23:30,139 --> 01:23:33,440
It's when you don't feel good.

1299
01:23:33,442 --> 01:23:36,043
Mm-hmm, that's close.
Me and you are alive.

1300
01:23:36,045 --> 01:23:39,680
All the trees
and plants outside

1301
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:43,183
And the animals
are alive, too.

1302
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:47,588
- The tree is alive?
- Yeah, the trees outside
are alive.

1303
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:51,725
- Houses are alive?
- No, houses aren't alive.

1304
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:54,795
- Why?
- Well, houses are just things.

1305
01:23:54,797 --> 01:23:58,799
And when you stop living,
it's called dying.

1306
01:23:58,801 --> 01:24:04,038
Animals die and people die
and plants die.

1307
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,740
Why people die?

1308
01:24:06,742 --> 01:24:08,709
Sometimes they get sick.

1309
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:11,045
Sometimes they have an accident.

1310
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:16,650
And the fish had an accident.

1311
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:24,258
And when things die,
they go some place else.

1312
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:26,093
Where?

1313
01:24:26,095 --> 01:24:29,129
Some in there
and your finger here.

1314
01:24:29,131 --> 01:24:30,264
There we go.

1315
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:35,636
There, you did it.

1316
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:38,338
Oh.

1317
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:53,187
She's sad.

1318
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:54,822
There you go, dada.

1319
01:24:54,824 --> 01:24:56,290
Thank you.

1320
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:00,694
What is that for?

1321
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:03,764
And what this little thing is,
is called a coffin.

1322
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:07,634
And sometimes,
what people do when things die

1323
01:25:07,636 --> 01:25:09,837
Is they bury them in the ground.

1324
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:14,274
Where we gonna bury.

1325
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:16,877
Are we going to bury something?

1326
01:25:16,879 --> 01:25:19,780
- Mm-hmm.
- Are we gonna bury our fish?

1327
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:21,815
Yeah, we're gonna bury the fish.

1328
01:25:21,817 --> 01:25:24,918
- In what?
- In the dirt.

1329
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,988
- But there's no dirt in here.
- I know.

1330
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:31,625
We have to go some place
to do that.

01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:55,149
