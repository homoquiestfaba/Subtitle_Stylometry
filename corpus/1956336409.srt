Richard.</i>

<i>In fact, to be quite frank,
it looks pretty bad.</i>

Rather than beat
around the bush,

10
00:02:09,052 --> 00:02:10,822
I'm just gonna come right out
and say it.

11
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:13,390
Richard, you have stage four
lung cancer.

12
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:17,459
The pain you've been
experiencing in your upper back

13
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:19,627
is actually the result
of malignant tumors

14
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:20,629
within your lungs,

15
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:24,502
which it sadly appears
you have for some time.

16
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:27,639
As we're catching this late
in the game,

17
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:30,975
your cancer has also had
the opportunity to spread

18
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:33,975
specifically to your spine,
and adrenals.

[emotive music playing]

20
00:02:36,913 --> 00:02:39,316
You wanna put in notice
with the college.

21
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,017
You should notify Veronica
and your daughter

22
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:46,424
as soon as possible as treatment
will begin immediately.

23
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:48,790
How long are we talking?

24
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:51,062
[doctor] With treatment, a year,

25
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:53,765
a year and a half,
if you're lucky.

26
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:56,933
And without?

27
00:02:58,634 --> 00:03:00,504
[doctor] Probably six months.

28
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:04,308
I am so sorry, Richard.

[Peter] So let's make this

00:03:48,752 --> 00:03:51,585
We get that extra
little bit of funding

34
00:03:51,587 --> 00:03:53,623
that we so desperately need.

35
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:57,762
Uh, any questions?

36
00:04:05,468 --> 00:04:06,737
Fuck.

37
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:11,641
What...? Uhm... Okay.

00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:55,019
Fuck! Jesus!

00:04:55,786 --> 00:04:57,422
Fuck it, huh?

46
00:04:57,653 --> 00:04:59,490
Fucking God!

47
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:00,957
Fuck you!

48
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:09,199

Shall the atheist
say grace then?

53
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:37,161
Shut up, Richard.

54
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:39,997
Of course, my dear.

55
00:05:40,831 --> 00:05:43,033
I actually have something
I wanna say.

56
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:47,237
Go ahead, kid. What do you got?

57
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,676
I wanted you to know
that I'm gay.

58
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:56,711
[laughs] What on Earth?

59
00:05:56,713 --> 00:05:58,779
[Richard] Jesus Christ.

60
00:05:58,781 --> 00:06:01,248
Olivia, I thought
it was something bad.

61
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,987
[laughs] No, you're not, Olive.

62
00:06:07,124 --> 00:06:08,123
What do you mean I'm not?

63
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,228
You're not gay. I mean,
you're not a lesbian.

64
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:11,929
- [scoffs]
- Yeah, I am.

65
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:15,764
Yeah. No, I think I'd know
my own sexual preference.

66
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,865
Uh, it's just a phase.

67
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:20,034
I, for one,
think it's fantastic.

68
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:21,269
Don't placate her.

69
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:22,870
I'm not placating my daughter.

70
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:24,906
How dare you deny me
like this.

71
00:06:24,908 --> 00:06:26,707
I'm not denying you, sweetheart.

72
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:29,176
I'm just denying your call
for attention

73
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:31,279
or whatever else this is.
That's all.

74
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:35,082
I know you, Olive,
better than you know yourself.

75
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:38,021
No, mother.
You know no shit about me.

76
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,091
Olivia, please come back,
sweetheart. Olivia.

77
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:45,997
[Veronica sighs] Let her go.

78
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:52,802
Your finesse of parenting...

79
00:06:54,838 --> 00:06:56,974
has always amazed me.

80
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,651
[Veronica] I also have something
I'd like to say.

81
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:09,853
I can't wait.

82
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:14,724
I'm having an affair.

83
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:19,829
I'm having an affair
and I thought you should know.

84
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:25,836
And why did you think
I should know?

85
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:29,606
Because it's with Henry.

86
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:31,676
Henry who?

87
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:34,812
Henry Wright.

88
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:36,877
- Henry Wright?
- Uh-hmm.

89
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,882
My boss?

90
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:42,118
[laughing]

91
00:07:46,223 --> 00:07:50,024
No, no, no, no. Veronica.
That's real revolting.

92
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:53,027
Are you out of your mind?
Come on.

93
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:56,299
At least have a little bit
of taste in your infidelity.

94
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:01,939
It's up to you, but I'd fucked
a pool boy myself or a plumber.

95
00:08:02,238 --> 00:08:05,807
Then had some fucking
nutless sack.

96
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:07,712
[Veronica] I assure you
it's not empty.

97
00:08:08,377 --> 00:08:09,312
What?

98
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:12,949
Henry has been blessed
with a spare testicle.

99
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:18,990
Henry was blessed
with a spare testicle?

100
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:24,327
Are you sure it's not a cyst
or a cancerous growth?

101
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:26,230
Do you even care?

102
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,331
About his third nut?

103
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:32,669
No. No, I don't.

104
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,838
As far as I'm concerned,
that real estate's

105
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,810
lost its value long ago.

106
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:44,215
You're such an ass.

107
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:46,850
Self-admitted.

108
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,353
So let us drink
to our holy matrimony.

109
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:54,888
Drink by yourself.

110
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,159
Much better idea.

111
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,830
Ugh. What was it you wanted
to tell us?

112
00:09:02,331 --> 00:09:04,067
[sighs] [clears throat]

113
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:08,105
I was, uh,
afraid I overcooked the steaks.

114
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,108
[Veronica sighs]
Such an asshole.

115
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,113
[clock chiming]

116
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,150
[girl] <i>No, but that's not
what she's saying at all.</i>

117
00:09:22,152 --> 00:09:25,322
She's laying the groundwork
for the whole feminist movement.

118
00:09:26,355 --> 00:09:27,424
Go on.

119
00:09:30,124 --> 00:09:31,225

in advance and...

122
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:37,467
Oh.

123
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:40,837
Aren't you gonna do anything?

124
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:42,972
Like what?

125
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:45,775
I don't know. Call someone.

126
00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:48,276
Were you friends with it?

127
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:50,210
Did you know it personally,
by, like, by name?

128
00:09:50,212 --> 00:09:51,347
It's a fucking bird.

129
00:09:52,115 --> 00:09:53,317
I don't know who to call.

130
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,184
- Can I continue?
- No, you may not.

131
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:58,055
[phone ringing]

132
00:09:58,388 --> 00:10:01,222
Oh, whose phone is it?
Is that your phone?

133
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:02,225
[student] Shit.

134
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:03,958
There we go. Here she is.

135
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,062
Sorry.

136
00:10:05,427 --> 00:10:06,931
Mine. Sorry.

137
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:09,966
Um, I thought
it was on vibrate but it's...

138
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,498
No, no, no, please,

139
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,504
take your call.
Stand up and take your call.

140
00:10:14,837 --> 00:10:17,107
Please. Don't be shy.

141
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:19,206
Stand up and take your call.

142
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,411
[phone continues ringing]

143
00:10:26,383 --> 00:10:27,384
Hello.

144
00:10:28,518 --> 00:10:30,421
I'm gonna call you back actually
because I'm in class.

145
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:33,224
No, as in I'm in class.

146
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,227
Right now. I'm standing up.

147
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:40,063
- [students laugh]
- I know it's weird. Okay.

148
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,963
Goodbye. Bye. Bye.

149
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:43,399
[boy laughs]

150
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,001
[Richard] Fascinating.

151
00:10:45,335 --> 00:10:46,269
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:48,139
Oh, don't be.

153
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:51,274
Okay.

154
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:54,408
From here on out,

155
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,780
we're gonna do things
very, very differently.

156
00:10:57,413 --> 00:11:00,415
So for those of you who are not
even remotely interested

157
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:01,985
in being here, please leave.

158
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:03,853
Just simply walk out the door

159
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:06,456
and you'll receive
an automatic C.

160
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:10,126
I no longer have time
to be wasted

161
00:11:10,393 --> 00:11:12,529
nor do I intend
on wasting yours.

162
00:11:12,995 --> 00:11:17,165
So for those of you
who receive grades of,

163
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:21,038
say, a C or worse,
let's just be proactive.

164
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:23,841
Pack up your shit.
And <i>vamos</i> now.

165
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,406
Hmm?

166
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:26,943
[soft cheerful music]

167
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,913
Good. Here we go.

168
00:11:31,947 --> 00:11:34,916
If any of you
have any intentions

169
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:38,252
of studying business,
get the fuck out now.

170
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:40,057
I'm not gonna say it again.

171
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:44,592
If you look down and you happen
to find yourself in sweatpants

172
00:11:44,594 --> 00:11:48,299
or rather pants with
the drawstring or something,

173
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:51,098
- just please leave.
- [girl] What?

174
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,636
Most important of all,
if you've never read a book

175
00:11:54,638 --> 00:11:57,141
for our own internal pleasure...

176
00:11:58,341 --> 00:12:00,144
you don't belong here.
Get out.

177
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:03,277
If any of you find yourself

178
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,615
falling into
any of these categories.

179
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:09,052
I assure you,
you will not do better than a C.

180
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:13,389
[laughs] Here we go.

181
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:18,528
The government workers
and the politicians included.

182
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,967
The, uh, sweatpants comment
is not a joke.

183
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:27,538
I'm sick. I have a cold.

184
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,444
Right. Now, for those of you
who are interested

185
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:38,382
in learning from greater minds,

186
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:41,317
and there are today,

187
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:44,551
you're in charge of reading
one book

188
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:46,387
and one book only
to this quarter.

189
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:49,223
After doing so,
you will then stand up here

190
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:51,095
and you will run a class
of your own.

191
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:57,401
Excellent. There go the kings
and queens of the water cooler,

192
00:12:58,268 --> 00:13:00,204
corporate whores of tomorrow.

193
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:05,909
C. Maybe not.

194
00:13:07,277 --> 00:13:11,282
And then you will stand up here
and you'll persuade your peers

195
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:14,418
of the work's importance.

196
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:17,153
For that, you'll receive a B.

197
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,991
If you teach us something new,
you receive an A.

198
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:24,995
Any questions?

199
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:27,430
Um...

200
00:13:29,032 --> 00:13:31,602
Ah-ha. Yes. One more thing.

201
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:35,369
No feminist or queer propaganda.

202
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:39,206
The plight of unkempt women
is truly the last thing

203
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,210
I would like to think about
right now.

204
00:13:41,778 --> 00:13:43,480
[girl] I don't think
you can do that.

205
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:45,448
- [Richard] I just did.
- [scoffs]

206
00:13:45,749 --> 00:13:48,686
And now, I shall embark
on an emotional...

207
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:51,455
bender for 72 hours.

208
00:13:52,154 --> 00:13:54,324
Most likely,
I'll be drinking alone

209
00:13:54,591 --> 00:13:56,223
and I'm all right with that.

210
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:59,196
So as a result,
class is cancelled.

211
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:02,665
That's it.

212
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:05,034
Class dismissed.

213
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:08,536
Oh, yeah, by the way,
if any of you sell marijuana

214
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:11,138
or you know anyone who does,
would you please visit me

215
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,442
during office hours?

216
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:14,110
Thanks. Bye.

217
00:14:19,682 --> 00:14:20,750
What the fuck?

218
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,087
I need to go on sabbatical
next quarter.

219
00:14:24,486 --> 00:14:28,089
I would... No, I can't give you
a sabbatical, it takes a year.

220
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:29,656
A year to get
that kind of thing done.

221
00:14:29,658 --> 00:14:31,626
You're gonna have to do
something to speed it up.

222
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:33,364
[laughs] No, I can't.

223
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:35,399
What do you want
to go on a sabbatical for?

224
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:39,767
I would like to write
the next great American novel.

225
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:41,469
- Oh, yeah?
- Or <i>novela,</i>

226
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:44,140
- depending on the length.
- What's it about?

227
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:46,509
It's gonna be about an orphan

228
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,609
who raises rabbits or bunnies
around there.

229
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:50,780
And what's it called?

230
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:54,584
Right now, the tentative title
is Bunny Fun Found

231
00:14:55,118 --> 00:14:57,084
because her name is Bunny
and oddly enough,

232
00:14:57,086 --> 00:14:58,652
- she was having fun...
- You're full of shit.

233
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:00,323
You're full of shit.
You're having me on.

234
00:15:01,157 --> 00:15:03,257
- I have cancer, Peter.
- What?

235
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:06,296
I have cancer
and it doesn't get look good.

236
00:15:08,163 --> 00:15:09,500
Jesus Christ, Richard.

237
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:11,467
[ambient music playing]

238
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:13,667
I don't want to die here.

239
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:15,236
I don't wanna die here
like this.

240
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:18,672
Please get me out.
Just let me die alone.

241
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:20,144
Let me die in peace.

242
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:23,276
Oh, Richard.

243
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:25,546
No hands above the table.

244
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:26,549
Okay.

245
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:29,753
What kind of cancer is it?

246
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:31,853
It's, uh, it's lung cancer.

247
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:33,157
You don't smoke.

248
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:36,192
No. I can now. [laughs]

249
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:38,825
Listen, this is what happens
to everybody.

250
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:40,163
It's what happens to all of us.

251
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:42,430
I mean, you could be ridden
with the same damn thing.

252
00:15:42,432 --> 00:15:43,665
Why would you say something
like that to me, huh?

253
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:46,800
No, no. I'm making a point.
I'm sorry. It came out wrong.

254
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:48,705
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- That's allright.

255
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:50,339
[waitress] There you go.

256
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:54,311
I really hate
these effeminate glasses.

257
00:16:01,183 --> 00:16:02,452
What are we gonna do?

258
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:07,323
I'm gonna fill
my medicine cabinet.

259
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,625
And...

260
00:16:10,393 --> 00:16:11,791
I'm gonna ride this thing out.

261
00:16:11,793 --> 00:16:13,261
Wait, you're not gonna
get treatments?

262
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,264
No.

263
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:19,535
Oh.

264
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:22,203
- You owe me, Peter.
- Uh, yes.

265
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:24,204
Yes. Yes, of course.

266
00:16:24,206 --> 00:16:25,208
Thank you.

267
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:28,876
You can let go of my hands now

268
00:16:28,878 --> 00:16:30,810
and then we can have a drink
maybe.

269
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:32,482
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

270
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:37,453
So to the months end.

271
00:16:38,488 --> 00:16:39,719
To your health.

272
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:41,488
There's no need to be facetious.

273
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,259
I didn't mean to be facetious.

274
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:45,493
And don't go blabbering

275
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:46,761
your little wet mouth
about this.

276
00:16:46,763 --> 00:16:48,963
- No, no.
- This is no one's business.

277
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:50,367
- but my own
- Of course.

278
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:52,368
- [Henry] I think your art is
- [siren wailing outside]

279
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:54,770
brilliant, stunning,

280
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:56,874
and a wonderful investment.

281
00:16:57,573 --> 00:16:59,543
In fact... [sighs]

282
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:01,511
[siren continues wailing]

283
00:17:02,644 --> 00:17:04,381
could you do the whole campus?

284
00:17:05,515 --> 00:17:07,818
- Certainly with your talent...
- To the College of Florida?

285
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:11,251
That's my responsibility.

286
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:12,722
You don't need to worry
about that.

287
00:17:16,392 --> 00:17:17,827
To your latest infidelity.

288
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:21,261
And your honorable cuckolding.

289
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:22,498
[ambient music playing]

290
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:24,734
Hmm-hmm.

291
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:28,271
Ooh, what's that?

292
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,671
It's a white oblong pill.

293
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:31,674
Where did you get it?

294
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:36,443
We're well-to-do
middle-aged wasps.

295
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:38,948
We can get prescriptions
for anything we want, darling.

296
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:42,251
Okay.

297
00:17:46,388 --> 00:17:47,757
If you behave yourself...

298
00:17:48,758 --> 00:17:50,826
I'll give you
a blue triangular one next.

299
00:17:51,426 --> 00:17:53,296
I heard you're quite fond
of them.

300
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:00,937
Onto serious matters.

301
00:18:01,403 --> 00:18:03,707
- Go for it.
- And you know at heart,

302
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:06,610
I don't give a damn
about you and Henry.

303
00:18:07,277 --> 00:18:10,044
You do whatever you please.
But you have to realize

304
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:13,584
that from here on out,
I'll be living just as freely.

305
00:18:15,718 --> 00:18:17,852
I've played a rather quiet role

306
00:18:17,854 --> 00:18:19,819
in the tragedy
that is our marriage.

307
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:20,856
and...

308
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:24,860
quite frankly, I'm done.

309
00:18:25,795 --> 00:18:29,266
It's time that we lived a bit
closer to the...

310
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:30,766
primal truth of it all.

311
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:36,006
So from this point on,
let us fuck who we wanna fuck.

312
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:39,343
Let us ingest
what we wanna ingest.

313
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:44,312
And all in all, just do whatever
the hell we damn well please.

314
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:45,716
Here, here.

315
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:48,251
One request,

316
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:51,755
that we do so discretely.

317
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:55,655
Let us at least attempt to keep
the parental damage

318
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:58,828
to our sweet lesbian love child
to a minimum.

319
00:18:59,362 --> 00:19:00,897
I wholeheartedly agree.

320
00:19:01,596 --> 00:19:05,501
Wonderful.
And the matter is settled.

321
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:10,539
Richard?

322
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:11,774
Yes, dear?

323
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:15,778
Dare I ask
if your equipment still works?

324
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:17,848
[Richard] I don't know.

325
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:20,884
I mean, sadly, it's laid dormant
for years.

326
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:26,523
But if it doesn't, it's just
one more prescription to fill.

327
00:19:28,124 --> 00:19:31,361
Here's to, uh, our new lives.

328
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,562
And your new freedoms.

329
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:36,766
Now, hand over a blue one
I've behaved myself admirably.

330
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:39,436
[Olivia] He was like this, um...

331
00:19:39,801 --> 00:19:43,603
17th century poet who fell
in love with his cousin and...

332
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:44,572
- [glass breaking]
- [Veronica laughs]

333
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:46,806
- ...fell in love with his cousin?
- Oh, shit.

334
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:48,808
[Veronica] You're such
an asshole.

335
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,443
- [Taylor] What?
- My parents are home.

336
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:51,612
[Taylor] Hey. It's okay.

337
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:53,549
[Olivia] Can you promise
not to judge me?

338
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,049
[Taylor]
Don't worry, seriously.

339
00:19:56,051 --> 00:19:57,651
[cheerful ambient music playing]

340
00:19:57,653 --> 00:19:59,687
- [Richard] It's broken.
- Hmm.

341
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:01,921
[Richard] I mean,
the whole thing is broken.

342
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:03,490
[chuckles]

343
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:06,696
- [Richard] That's [mumbles].
- [Veronica laughs]

344
00:20:07,596 --> 00:20:10,433
Oh, Olivia. Look, dear.

345
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,036
- It's Olivia and company.
- What's going on?

346
00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:15,902
[Richard] Uh, your mom
broke the lamp.

347
00:20:15,904 --> 00:20:17,708
[laughs]

348
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,739
Are you all right?

349
00:20:19,741 --> 00:20:21,941
Yes, darling.
Of course, why wouldn't we be?

350
00:20:21,943 --> 00:20:23,811
Because you seem like
you're drunk or on drugs.

351
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:26,546
[Richard] Admittedly,
we are on a bit of both.

352
00:20:26,548 --> 00:20:27,847
[music continues]

353
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:29,984
But don't let that influence
your decisions.

354
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:31,219
[Veronica] Oh,
don't listen to him.

355
00:20:31,221 --> 00:20:35,088
They're just prescriptions.
I'm Veronica, Olivia's mother.

356
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,423
Hi, I'm Taylor.

357
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:37,760
Oh, nice to meet you...

358
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:39,860
[burps] Excuse me.

359
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:42,566
Careful, dear.
Let's not exert yourself.

360
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:46,199
So is this... is she...

361
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:47,867
[Olivia] Taylor is Taylor,
mother.

362
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:49,737
Yes, yes, of course, you are.

363
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:50,807
[Taylor giggles]

364
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:52,942
And by the way, I'm Richard.

365
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:57,010
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, please, come.

366
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:58,746
- Join us for a drink.
- No, hang on. No.

367
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:00,948
You're being very creepy.
We're going.

368
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,583
- Creepy?
- [Olivia] Yes.

369
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:04,121
[Veronica] We're just
having fun.

370
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:05,452
Come on.

371
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:07,086
Hey, well, it was very nice
meeting you.

372
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:08,625
- [Veronica] Bye.
- Nice to meet you.

373
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:12,695
That was pleasant.

374
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,967
So how do you think that went?

375
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:19,632
[Veronica] On a scale
of one to ten,

376
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:21,037
I'd say a four.

377
00:21:22,904 --> 00:21:24,007
Agreed.

378
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,476
I'm only mildly disappointed
in myself.

379
00:21:28,144 --> 00:21:31,580
I feel ashamed. Yeah.

380
00:21:31,847 --> 00:21:33,149
[music continues]

381
00:21:33,982 --> 00:21:35,851
[Veronica] What happened
to us, Richard?

382
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:38,087
What happened to us?

383
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:41,057
Life.

384
00:21:42,124 --> 00:21:43,190
[Veronica] You know,
if I could go back in time,

385
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:46,430
I don't even know what it is
I'm supposed to fix.

386
00:21:47,696 --> 00:21:50,500
[Richard] Oh, I could readily
think of many things.

387
00:21:50,932 --> 00:21:52,435
I didn't ask you.

388
00:21:52,934 --> 00:21:53,903
True.

389
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,007
[Veronica] You're gonna break
all our wedding presents.

390
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,608
Did you ever notice
that they're all hollow?

391
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:01,444
Ah, what does that mean?

392
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:03,779
It doesn't matter.

393
00:22:04,913 --> 00:22:06,148
[laughing]

394
00:22:06,682 --> 00:22:08,518
[Richard laughing]

395
00:22:09,684 --> 00:22:10,921
Richard?

396
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,056
Yes, dear?

397
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,559
Thank you for helping me.

398
00:22:19,662 --> 00:22:20,861
Of course.

399
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:22,132
[soft dramatic music playing]

400
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:24,965
Holding your hair back
has always been

401
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:26,866
one of my life's great honors.

402
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:28,571
I'm serious.

403
00:22:29,571 --> 00:22:31,006
In ways, so am I.

404
00:22:36,846 --> 00:22:38,981
Do you think Olivia hates me?

405
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,251
Yes.

406
00:22:43,818 --> 00:22:45,221
But she's supposed to.

407
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,595
I'm not a bad person.

408
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:55,999
I know you're not, Veronica.

409
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:00,737
No one ever said you were.

410
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:09,879
[indistinct chatter]

411
00:23:10,846 --> 00:23:12,816
[Richard] <i>Well, you are a...</i>

412
00:23:13,182 --> 00:23:15,852
relatively attractive
group of kids.

413
00:23:16,117 --> 00:23:19,286
I mean, I see a few
weak chins here and there.

414
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:22,221
But, uh, I think that's probably
just due to some

415
00:23:22,223 --> 00:23:25,191
fine New England breeding. Hmm?

416
00:23:25,193 --> 00:23:28,128
Beautiful mother, rich father,

417
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,700
cold winter, that kind of thing.

418
00:23:32,602 --> 00:23:33,836
Do you smoke?

419
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:35,605
No.

420
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:37,171
You look like you do.

421
00:23:37,173 --> 00:23:38,805
I do, Mr. Brown.

422
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:40,609
Would you mind if I have one?

423
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,112
No, not at all.

424
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,716
So, um...

425
00:23:47,215 --> 00:23:50,286
let's go through
and introduce ourselves.

426
00:23:51,753 --> 00:23:53,022
Any volunteers?

427
00:23:54,323 --> 00:23:57,290
I'll go first.
My name is Richard.

428
00:23:57,292 --> 00:23:59,562
I'm your professor. Go ahead.

429
00:24:06,368 --> 00:24:07,803
[groans]

430
00:24:09,672 --> 00:24:10,839
[gasps]

431
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:13,309
Wow.

432
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:15,645
That was fucking wretched.

433
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:19,115
Jesus.

434
00:24:19,682 --> 00:24:20,916
Okay.

435
00:24:21,817 --> 00:24:22,885
Who's next?

436
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:27,623
How about you?

437
00:24:28,223 --> 00:24:30,693
- Me?
- Yeah, you,

438
00:24:30,893 --> 00:24:32,028
girl with the phone.

439
00:24:33,095 --> 00:24:34,297
Who are you,

440
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:36,229
why should we know you,

441
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:38,801
what do you want to do
with your life?

442
00:24:40,702 --> 00:24:41,704
Okay.

443
00:24:43,372 --> 00:24:44,608
I'm Claire.

444
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,844
I'm from Upstate New York.

445
00:24:50,112 --> 00:24:51,348
Why you should know me?

446
00:24:54,215 --> 00:24:55,784
I don't know. [chuckles]

447
00:24:56,352 --> 00:24:57,621
Yeah. I don't know.

448
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,994
I guess because my uncle
is the president of the school.

449
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:06,997
Ew. Henry Wright is your uncle?

450
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,930
- Yes.
- I can't stand the fuck.

451
00:25:09,932 --> 00:25:11,101
[laughs]

452
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:13,403
I don't really like him either.

453
00:25:13,868 --> 00:25:15,371
That's very good to hear.

454
00:25:15,938 --> 00:25:18,305
I mean, he's so peach melba.

455
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:20,410
Just slimy and...

456
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,211
I've got an idea.

457
00:25:24,012 --> 00:25:26,015
How about we put
a little pause to this shit

458
00:25:27,016 --> 00:25:29,048
and we go down to the bar,

459
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,184
and we can run over it there.

460
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:33,187
My biological father
actually met my mothers

461
00:25:33,189 --> 00:25:35,956
at a monthly compost meeting
in Boston.

462
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:38,324
He's this social anthropologist
over at a...

463
00:25:38,326 --> 00:25:40,896
[Richard] Okay. Rose,

464
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:44,033
go and grab two more pitchers
for everybody, would you?

465
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,767
Why don't you just put them
in your tab?

466
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:48,168
No, that's not the point.

467
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,504
See, I want you to go
and get them.

468
00:25:50,506 --> 00:25:52,776
And I want you go
and get them now, please?

469
00:25:53,776 --> 00:25:54,911
Can I get some hummus?

470
00:25:55,211 --> 00:25:56,880
Yeah, get some hummus.

471
00:25:57,078 --> 00:25:58,714
[soft ambient music]

472
00:25:59,347 --> 00:26:00,750
Thank you.

473
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:04,019
Let me give you all
a piece of advice.

474
00:26:04,987 --> 00:26:09,155
Steer very clear of anyone
who has even the faintest,

475
00:26:09,157 --> 00:26:13,459
slightest whip
of intentional conception.

476
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:15,328
I was conceived intentionally.

477
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,000
Well, I need to know your name.

478
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:21,203
By the way,
I hope your parents all told you

479
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:24,340
that you fucking die at the end.

480
00:26:25,508 --> 00:26:27,440
You're gonna die.
You're gonna die.

481
00:26:27,442 --> 00:26:29,942
You're gonna die. One day,

482
00:26:29,944 --> 00:26:33,348
even our blessed
little Rose will die.

483
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:36,318
So, what I'm wondering is,
why the fuck

484
00:26:36,852 --> 00:26:40,953
do we sort of float
through this weird thing

485
00:26:40,955 --> 00:26:43,959
called life without living?

486
00:26:44,492 --> 00:26:46,162
You know, live.

487
00:26:47,496 --> 00:26:49,395
Don't exist. Don't simply exist.

488
00:26:49,397 --> 00:26:51,832
That's boring as fuck. Live.

489
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:54,535
You know. Stir some shit up.
Fuck some shit up.

490
00:26:54,537 --> 00:27:00,977
Fuck it right. What I wanna
focus on is enriching our lives.

491
00:27:01,477 --> 00:27:04,111
And try to extract
some sort of wisdom

492
00:27:04,113 --> 00:27:05,845
that we can carry with us.

493
00:27:05,847 --> 00:27:08,382
You know, something other than
mommy and daddy's baggage.

494
00:27:08,384 --> 00:27:10,153
Ah, bless you, dear.

495
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:14,490
You know, I'd wink at you
but I never learned how.

496
00:27:16,192 --> 00:27:18,525
So I just thought
you should know it.

497
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:21,394
- Anybody want anything else?
- Yeah, could I get a whiskey?

498
00:27:21,396 --> 00:27:22,464
Oh, that's fine.

499
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:26,099
She winked at me.

500
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:27,601
I got the hummus, so...

501
00:27:27,603 --> 00:27:28,901
Christmas is saved.

00:27:28,903 --> 00:27:30,203

503
00:27:30,205 --> 00:27:31,406
[Richard] My God.

504
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:33,777
Here we go.

505
00:27:34,143 --> 00:27:36,476
May we forever remember

506
00:27:36,478 --> 00:27:38,578
that in each and every moment,

507
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,350
we are composing the stories
of our lives.

508
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:45,821
Let's aim to make it
a meaningful read

509
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:49,159
or at least,
an interesting one, yeah?

510
00:27:49,892 --> 00:27:51,290
All right. Cheers.

511
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:53,362
[students] Cheers.

512
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:56,965
Now, if you will excuse me,

513
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:01,004
I intend to explore
a smidgen of infidelity.

514
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:03,903
[Veronica] What the fuck?

515
00:28:03,905 --> 00:28:05,441

Um, mom says I'm not allowed
to go to state schools.

709
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:47,887
Your mom is not allowed
to say you're not allowed.

710
00:37:47,889 --> 00:37:50,657
It's probably best if you don't.
[clears throat]

711
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:51,990
Don't listen to him.
Listen to me.

712
00:37:51,992 --> 00:37:53,827
Splendid work, truly.

713
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:55,628
- Thank you, Peter.
- [Peter] Yeah.

714
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,898
What do you think, Olive?

715
00:37:57,766 --> 00:37:59,769
The... uh, it was... yeah,
it was good.

716
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:01,537
It's all right, yeah.

717
00:38:03,038 --> 00:38:06,139
So, shall we have
a celebratory drink?

718
00:38:06,141 --> 00:38:09,041
I'd love to, but Henry has me
going out to dinner

719
00:38:09,043 --> 00:38:11,778
with the benefactors.
It's an old money from Connecticut.

720
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,646
- Oh.
- I'll see you two at home.

721
00:38:13,648 --> 00:38:15,818
Bye, sweetie. Thanks, Peter.

722
00:38:18,052 --> 00:38:19,251
Are you sure you don't want

723
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:20,789
a little splash of vodka
or brownie?

724
00:38:21,188 --> 00:38:23,655
Why are you and mom
still together?

725
00:38:23,657 --> 00:38:26,494
[laughs] Yeah.

726
00:38:27,496 --> 00:38:29,465
That's a rather odd question.

727
00:38:29,764 --> 00:38:30,932
No, it's not.

728
00:38:31,932 --> 00:38:34,570
And I guess you're right,
we... um...

729
00:38:35,202 --> 00:38:36,806
I think as you get older,

730
00:38:38,606 --> 00:38:42,941
you, um, find yourself
needing someone

731
00:38:42,943 --> 00:38:45,815
to hold accountable for life

732
00:38:46,547 --> 00:38:49,717
not turning out exactly
as you'd imagined it.

733
00:38:51,052 --> 00:38:52,588
Jesus, dad.

734
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,955
I know.

735
00:38:55,789 --> 00:38:59,695
But listen to me, not every
relationship has to be that.

736
00:39:01,596 --> 00:39:03,565
I mean, having said that,
most are.

737
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,301
Okay.

738
00:39:07,668 --> 00:39:11,574
On that happy note.
How's it going with Taylor?

739
00:39:12,673 --> 00:39:13,976
It's going really well.

740
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,713
Yeah? Good, that's good.

741
00:39:20,715 --> 00:39:21,851
That's very good.

742
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:25,721
Are you in love?

743
00:39:31,992 --> 00:39:33,996
Yeah. I am.

744
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:37,867
Wow. No shit.

745
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,772
Yeah, well, I'm happy for you,
sweetheart.

746
00:39:44,606 --> 00:39:46,976
I'm so happy.
I'm so happy for you.

747
00:39:48,842 --> 00:39:49,844
Thanks.

748
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,786
You make sure
she understands your worth.

749
00:39:59,286 --> 00:40:01,990
- [Olivia] I know. She does.
- She better.

750
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:04,593
She damn well better.

751
00:40:15,637 --> 00:40:16,972
Your daughter is in love.

752
00:40:18,974 --> 00:40:20,576
Did you tell her to be careful?

753
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:21,810
No.

754
00:40:24,646 --> 00:40:26,081
Told her to enjoy herself.

755
00:40:29,884 --> 00:40:32,818
[girl] <i>To realize one's destiny
is a person's only obligation.</i>

756
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,954
Uh, and so, uh, he begins
listening to the desert,

757
00:40:34,956 --> 00:40:37,293
and, uh discovering
the soul of the world,

758
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,626
which then inevitably,
uh, leads us to...

759
00:40:39,628 --> 00:40:40,796
[Richard] All right, stop.

760
00:40:41,795 --> 00:40:42,931
You get a B.

761
00:40:43,164 --> 00:40:45,200
- But I'm not finished.
- Take a seat.

762
00:40:48,168 --> 00:40:49,668
[boy] I thought it was great.

763
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:50,806
[Richard]
Let me ask you a question.

764
00:40:51,873 --> 00:40:53,809
Are you guys getting anything
out of this shit?

765
00:40:54,074 --> 00:40:55,041
[students] Yeah.

766
00:40:55,043 --> 00:40:58,079
Good. Because I have to say,
I am as well.

767
00:40:58,313 --> 00:41:02,014
I mean, you're all rather
a solid group of young adults,

768
00:41:02,016 --> 00:41:03,416
and I enjoy your company.

769
00:41:03,418 --> 00:41:07,189
[Rose] Yeah. Yeah, uh, I'd say
we're all pretty mature.

770
00:41:08,023 --> 00:41:11,827
Well, maturity is really just
another word for...

771
00:41:12,226 --> 00:41:13,295
how much misery you'd swallow.

772
00:41:13,862 --> 00:41:15,030
Yeah, totally.

773
00:41:16,297 --> 00:41:17,362
[Richard] I'm talking about the
piss and shit of others, Rose,

774
00:41:17,364 --> 00:41:18,733
not your own.

775
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:20,833
Do you mind if I smoke a joint?

776
00:41:20,835 --> 00:41:22,170
Mm-mm.

777
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:23,838
Um...

778
00:41:24,706 --> 00:41:25,708
Thanks.

779
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:28,907
I'm more than happy to help,
uh, pick up his classes,

780
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:30,846
if that helps at all.
[clears throat]

781
00:41:31,045 --> 00:41:32,380
- [coughing]
- [laughing]

782
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:34,950
[man] You got to be
kidding me.

783
00:41:35,717 --> 00:41:38,050
Is he smoking
a marijuana cigarette?

784
00:41:38,052 --> 00:41:41,688
[Peter] Uh, look, um,
maybe he's just trying to be...

785
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,224
[man] Fucking unbelievable.

786
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:45,691
Oh, Richard.

787
00:41:45,693 --> 00:41:48,297
- [soft ambient music playing]
- [people chattering]

788
00:41:49,797 --> 00:41:51,332
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

789
00:41:53,034 --> 00:41:55,735
I have cancer,
I'm supposed to wear sunglasses

790
00:41:55,737 --> 00:41:57,269
in unusual places.

791
00:41:57,271 --> 00:41:58,273
Yeah.

792
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:05,146
Excuse me,
can we have two more please?

793
00:42:06,715 --> 00:42:08,917
Uh, no, uh, the check please.

794
00:42:11,018 --> 00:42:12,184
Why?

795
00:42:12,186 --> 00:42:15,921
Look, you're coming with me.

796
00:42:15,923 --> 00:42:17,291
I don't wanna go with you.

797
00:42:18,393 --> 00:42:19,992
[Richard] Peter,
where are we going?

798
00:42:19,994 --> 00:42:21,793
[Peter] I'm taking you
to support group.

799
00:42:21,795 --> 00:42:23,429
[Richard] A support group
for what?

800
00:42:23,431 --> 00:42:24,766
- Cancer.
- Oh, Jesus.

801
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,867
[Richard] Want me to help you
with your sabbatical,

802
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:28,867
then do this for me.
This is not easy for me,

803
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:29,969
it's actually, it's quite hard.

804
00:42:29,971 --> 00:42:33,342
Uh, I understand that, but,
you know, it's my death.

805
00:42:33,807 --> 00:42:34,909
Yeah.

806
00:42:35,976 --> 00:42:37,142
What the fuck is this?

807
00:42:37,144 --> 00:42:39,014
Well, it's, uh, it's Barbara's.

808
00:42:39,246 --> 00:42:41,880
Eww. Um, I'm not getting in.

809
00:42:41,882 --> 00:42:44,118
Shut up,
and get in the damn car.

810
00:42:45,753 --> 00:42:47,021
It actually drives quite nice.

811
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:48,791
Door.

812
00:42:49,757 --> 00:42:51,192
- [Peter] Here you go.
- Well done.

813
00:42:52,793 --> 00:42:54,228
[engine starts]

814
00:42:55,864 --> 00:43:00,335
After 20 years of marriage,
I thought she'd, you know,

815
00:43:00,934 --> 00:43:03,072
stick around until I died.

816
00:43:04,438 --> 00:43:06,974
At least, I hoped she would.

817
00:43:08,376 --> 00:43:11,180
But, I guess,
it was really no point,

818
00:43:11,445 --> 00:43:14,514
you know, I guess it makes
more sense for her

819
00:43:14,516 --> 00:43:16,218
to move on now.

820
00:43:19,052 --> 00:43:21,355
But despite all that, I'm-I'm...

821
00:43:22,356 --> 00:43:23,992
I'm feeling pretty good.

822
00:43:24,224 --> 00:43:26,894
[stammers] I'm doing okay.

823
00:43:27,094 --> 00:43:28,096
Uh-hmm.

824
00:43:28,896 --> 00:43:29,898
Thank you.

825
00:43:31,032 --> 00:43:33,365
Thank you for sharing
the journey of your battle, Ed.

826
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:34,802
[man] Uh-hmm.

827
00:43:35,235 --> 00:43:37,405
All right.
Whenever you're ready.

828
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,211
Uh, my name is Peter,
I'm healthy,

829
00:43:44,144 --> 00:43:45,748
I don't have cancer,

830
00:43:47,114 --> 00:43:48,914
at least I don't think I do.

831
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:49,951
Um...

832
00:43:51,052 --> 00:43:52,187
my friend,

833
00:43:53,153 --> 00:43:54,220
Richard does.

834
00:43:54,222 --> 00:43:57,226
And I thought that he could here
and talk about it.

835
00:44:00,527 --> 00:44:01,763
I'm...

836
00:44:03,297 --> 00:44:04,265
scared,

837
00:44:05,532 --> 00:44:06,868
I'm worried,

838
00:44:08,135 --> 00:44:11,273
I don't wanna lose
my best friend. [cries]

839
00:44:11,472 --> 00:44:12,405
Oh.

840
00:44:12,407 --> 00:44:14,943
That is really very lovely
of you, Peter.

841
00:44:15,342 --> 00:44:18,279
Thank you for sharing
the journey of your...

842
00:44:20,148 --> 00:44:21,283
battle.

843
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:23,950
All right, Richard.

844
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,988
- [woman coughs]
- Whenever you're ready.

845
00:44:26,487 --> 00:44:29,358
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not doing this. No, no.

846
00:44:30,224 --> 00:44:32,027
- Come on.
- I have nothing to say.

847
00:44:32,293 --> 00:44:34,159
- [Peter] It's good for you.
- Uh, well, um,

848
00:44:34,161 --> 00:44:35,628
why don't you start
with your diagnosis?

849
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:38,567
- Uh-hmm.
- [Richard] Uh, I'd rather not,

850
00:44:39,032 --> 00:44:41,300
I'd actually prefer
to leave this place

851
00:44:41,302 --> 00:44:43,168
because the lighting
is poor down here,

852
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,503
and it smells like urinal cakes
and sugar cookies.

853
00:44:45,505 --> 00:44:47,139
Uh, well, you find that if you...

854
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:48,240
if you start
with your diagnosis...

855
00:44:48,242 --> 00:44:50,409
I think that you're gonna find
that I already know

856
00:44:50,411 --> 00:44:53,148
that I disagree with whatever
you're about to say.

857
00:44:53,447 --> 00:44:56,184
Peter, let's go.
We'll give it another shot.

858
00:44:57,385 --> 00:45:01,220
Would anyone else like to go
and grab a drink,

859
00:45:01,222 --> 00:45:03,826
and escape
this emotional circle jerk?

860
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:06,157
What about you?

861
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:07,596
You might need a drink or two.

862
00:45:09,597 --> 00:45:11,432
Richard, I... I've got cancer.

863
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,202
[Richard] So do I.

864
00:45:13,534 --> 00:45:16,501
Well, best of luck
with your impending deaths.

865
00:45:16,503 --> 00:45:18,873
- Yeah, you, too.
- Thank you.

866
00:45:20,173 --> 00:45:23,376
Oh, Richard, you gotta stay.
Uh, I wanna help you.

867
00:45:23,378 --> 00:45:25,013
Peter, no.

868
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,914
I'd die here, and my corpse

869
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:30,483
is nothing more than
a breeding ground for ticks.

870
00:45:30,485 --> 00:45:31,617
[soft ambient music]

871
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:33,155
Plus, this way,

872
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:36,088
I get to collect my salary
until the bitter end.

873
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:37,292
Uh-huh.

874
00:45:38,092 --> 00:45:40,092
Maybe even after,
depending on

875
00:45:40,094 --> 00:45:44,233
how quickly it takes me
to find, my, uh, body.

876
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:47,068
Oh.

877
00:45:52,974 --> 00:45:55,344
I have to leave for, uh...

878
00:45:56,543 --> 00:45:58,110
for Olivia's sake.

879
00:45:58,112 --> 00:45:59,177
No.

880
00:45:59,179 --> 00:46:01,179
Oh, no, no, come on. Listen.

881
00:46:01,181 --> 00:46:03,451
- Uh, yeah.
- All right. I'm gonna...

00:56:05,152 --> 00:56:06,717
You're simply saying that
for effect.

1060
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:08,889
You want me to repeat myself,
I won't.

1061
00:56:09,757 --> 00:56:11,889
I am chancellor
of this university.

1062
00:56:11,891 --> 00:56:14,495
I couldn't give
a fucking rat's balls

1063
00:56:14,862 --> 00:56:17,865
who the fuck you are.
I have tenure,

1064
00:56:18,298 --> 00:56:19,501
and furthermore,

1065
00:56:20,768 --> 00:56:22,836
you're in no position of power
when it comes to the two of us.

1066
00:56:23,836 --> 00:56:25,670
You're cheating on your wife,
Henry.

1067
00:56:25,672 --> 00:56:29,141
You're having an affair,
and not just any affair,

1068
00:56:29,143 --> 00:56:32,713
but one with a wife
of a devoted faculty member,

1069
00:56:33,614 --> 00:56:34,749
specifically

1070
00:56:35,782 --> 00:56:36,616
mine.

1071
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:41,052
Not only that.
But you've allocated funds

1072
00:56:41,054 --> 00:56:44,322
from a dwindling budget
for granite erections

1073
00:56:44,324 --> 00:56:47,628
that you just littered
throughout this entire campus.

1074
00:56:48,228 --> 00:56:51,862
And oddly enough,
they come from the woman

1075
00:56:51,864 --> 00:56:53,767
that you're bird dogging
on the side.

1076
00:56:54,802 --> 00:56:55,834
Can you remind me

1077
00:56:55,836 --> 00:56:58,907
how much does one
of Veronica's works go for?

1078
00:57:00,773 --> 00:57:04,909
Chancellor, I have mounted you
like a running stag,

1079
00:57:04,911 --> 00:57:07,214
and I am pumping away at you,

1080
00:57:07,648 --> 00:57:09,182
like a savage,

1081
00:57:09,782 --> 00:57:12,119
and you know it.

1082
00:57:12,385 --> 00:57:14,686
[church bell ringing]

1083
00:57:14,688 --> 00:57:15,789
Now,

1084
00:57:16,856 --> 00:57:18,956
I'm gonna take it
that my request for sabbatical

1085
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:20,761
has been accepted.

1086
00:57:22,028 --> 00:57:23,630
[church bell ringing]

1087
00:57:29,369 --> 00:57:31,005
[coughing]

1088
00:57:56,096 --> 00:57:58,032
Don't look so enthusiastic.

1089
00:57:58,699 --> 00:57:59,800
Why would I?

1090
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,603
Well, for one,
it's gonna be catered.

1091
00:58:03,302 --> 00:58:06,737
All Barbara ever talks about
is how well traveled she is.

1092
00:58:06,739 --> 00:58:08,108
Well, what else
would she talk about?

1093
00:58:08,742 --> 00:58:09,777
Thank you, dear.

1094
00:58:12,112 --> 00:58:14,949
The air in Ibiza,

1095
00:58:15,248 --> 00:58:16,914
[soft music playing]

1096
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:18,619
there's really nothing like it.

1097
00:58:19,952 --> 00:58:21,952
I'm getting misty,
just thinking about it.

1098
00:58:21,954 --> 00:58:23,889
Peter, put our agent in touch
with them, all right?

1099
00:58:23,891 --> 00:58:26,858
Yes, of course, yes,
I'd be happy to.

1100
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,958
[coughs]

1101
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,962
Richard?

1102
00:58:30,097 --> 00:58:31,265
Richard, what's the matter?

1103
00:58:31,465 --> 00:58:34,068
Uh, darling, let him be.

1104
00:58:34,967 --> 00:58:37,802
[Barbara] Anyway,
as I was saying, Ibiza...

1105
00:58:37,804 --> 00:58:38,839
Are you all right?

1106
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:40,738
- [Barbara] You won't regret it.
- I'm more than all right.

1107
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,309
- You can't.
- I'm perfect.

1108
00:58:42,742 --> 00:58:44,746
I mean, unless you're mad.

1109
00:58:45,045 --> 00:58:47,144
Am I right or what, Peter?

1110
00:58:47,146 --> 00:58:49,213
Oh, you're right, darling,
you're right.

1111
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,217
[Barbara giggles]

1112
00:58:51,318 --> 00:58:53,284
[Barbara] Does anybody else
have bones in the fish?

1113
00:58:53,286 --> 00:58:54,885
[Peter] We have something
to celebrate.

1114
00:58:54,887 --> 00:58:57,289
What's that?
You got cancer, too?

1115
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:59,758
No. I do not.
Why do you keep saying that?

1116
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,825
Uh, my...

1117
00:59:00,827 --> 00:59:03,095
Uh, I... my cyst is rather sore.

1118
00:59:03,097 --> 00:59:04,396
Uh-oh, something in your throat?

1119
00:59:04,398 --> 00:59:05,930
I think I should
get it screened.

1120
00:59:05,932 --> 00:59:06,733
- Maybe.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1121
00:59:07,134 --> 00:59:08,902
- [Barbara sings] <i>Morocco.</i>
- Yeah.

1122
00:59:09,168 --> 00:59:12,170
Uh, Richard, uh,
no, no, no,

1123
00:59:12,172 --> 00:59:13,972
that'll only encourage her.

1124
00:59:13,974 --> 00:59:15,974
...we've noticed
that it's allowed us

1125
00:59:15,976 --> 00:59:19,144
every time we've been
to discover something new

1126
00:59:19,146 --> 00:59:20,147
about ourselves.

1127
00:59:22,315 --> 00:59:25,952
You, my friend, have been
awarded a sabbatical.

1128
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:27,454
Thank you.

1129
00:59:28,556 --> 00:59:30,354
Henry Wright signed
the paperwork, only last week.

1130
00:59:30,356 --> 00:59:32,427
- [Barbara] Excuse me.
- [Peter] See, I told you.

1131
00:59:32,992 --> 00:59:34,327
What are you two doing?

1132
00:59:35,061 --> 00:59:36,827
Uh we're discussing work.
That's all.

1133
00:59:36,829 --> 00:59:39,166
Peter, it's my birthday,

1134
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:42,803
save it for another time,
and come mingle.

1135
00:59:43,202 --> 00:59:45,907
- All right.
- And don't close these doors.

1136
00:59:46,106 --> 00:59:47,308
[Peter] No, darling.

1137
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:51,108
[Barbara] Anyway,
Peter was petrified...

1138
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:53,211
Why the hell
did we ever get married?

1139
00:59:53,213 --> 00:59:54,215
[groans]

1140
01:00:00,853 --> 01:00:02,322
[mellow music]

1141
01:00:04,557 --> 01:00:05,760
You okay?

1142
01:00:07,094 --> 01:00:09,831
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, babe.

1143
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:13,367
[groans]

1144
01:00:15,235 --> 01:00:16,403
Are you sure?

1145
01:00:17,871 --> 01:00:18,873
Yeah.

1146
01:00:22,576 --> 01:00:24,512
Yeah. I'm gonna be fine.

1147
01:00:26,112 --> 01:00:27,813
[Claire] <i>The person
one loves at first</i>

1148
01:00:27,815 --> 01:00:29,751
<i>is not the person
one loves at last.</i>

1149
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:31,753
<i>Love is not an end,</i>

1150
01:00:32,351 --> 01:00:34,452
it's a process through,
which one person attempts

1151
01:00:34,454 --> 01:00:35,757
to know another.

1152
01:00:38,324 --> 01:00:39,326
That's it.

1153
01:00:39,893 --> 01:00:41,963
[Richard] And in a word?

1154
01:00:42,295 --> 01:00:45,930
In two words,
deceptively simple.

1155
01:00:45,932 --> 01:00:48,400
[Richard] Beautifully,
beautifully executed.

1156
01:00:48,402 --> 01:00:54,342
And it's a really nice way to
end the class with a little,

1157
01:00:54,875 --> 01:00:55,876
[whistle]

1158
01:00:56,143 --> 01:00:57,278
kick in the ass.

1159
01:00:58,077 --> 01:00:59,413
So, you get an A.

1160
01:00:59,913 --> 01:01:01,882
- Thank you.
- [Richard] You're welcome.

1161
01:01:02,382 --> 01:01:04,485
And I suppose the rest of you
are waiting

1162
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:09,220
for me to vomit out
some profound words of wisdom.

1163
01:01:09,222 --> 01:01:10,454
Yeah, kind of.

1164
01:01:10,456 --> 01:01:13,094
Oh, thought you'd never ask.

1165
01:01:15,161 --> 01:01:16,930
Come here, give me a hand.

1166
01:01:17,597 --> 01:01:18,863
Thanks.

1167
01:01:18,865 --> 01:01:20,568
- [groans]
- Hey, hey, okay.

1168
01:01:21,568 --> 01:01:22,570
Listen...

1169
01:01:23,402 --> 01:01:26,873
the world needs people
like you.

1170
01:01:28,074 --> 01:01:31,978
The world is literally dying
for your kind.

1171
01:01:33,512 --> 01:01:36,550
Embrace that responsibility,
and you run with it.

1172
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:41,021
Get out there, earn your keep.
Give back.

1173
01:01:41,922 --> 01:01:45,023
It's not gonna be easy.
Never gonna be easy.

1174
01:01:45,025 --> 01:01:46,490
For much of it,
you'll stand alone

1175
01:01:46,492 --> 01:01:49,329
but you've got to stand strong.

1176
01:01:50,329 --> 01:01:51,865
You know, I beg you

1177
01:01:52,532 --> 01:01:55,336
to not give into mediocrity,

1178
01:01:55,601 --> 01:01:58,105
like the other 98 percent
of the world.

1179
01:01:59,072 --> 01:02:02,076
Because you would be doing
yourselves,

1180
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:05,545
and the world,
a greatest disservice.

1181
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,015
You're all too smart.

1182
01:02:08,648 --> 01:02:10,917
You're too smart
to let it go to waste.

1183
01:02:11,485 --> 01:02:15,086
And you've got one shot at this.

1184
01:02:15,088 --> 01:02:16,390
One fucking shot.

1185
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:20,060
Don't let a moment of it
slip by.

1186
01:02:21,394 --> 01:02:23,998
Grab it, snatch it up,
make it yours.

1187
01:02:25,431 --> 01:02:27,067
Celebrate every moment.

1188
01:02:27,701 --> 01:02:29,903
Celebrate every fucking breath.

1189
01:02:33,472 --> 01:02:35,141
I'm telling you, life,

1190
01:02:35,509 --> 01:02:37,010
it's a birdsong.

1191
01:02:43,717 --> 01:02:45,286
[music fades]

1192
01:02:46,286 --> 01:02:47,655
Was that it?

1193
01:02:49,356 --> 01:02:52,260
Yeah, I think... I think so, yeah.

1194
01:02:53,293 --> 01:02:54,595
Yeah, that's it.

1195
01:02:56,396 --> 01:02:58,099
[choir singing]

1196
01:03:10,443 --> 01:03:13,014
[groaning]

1197
01:03:13,413 --> 01:03:15,650
[choir singing]

1198
01:03:21,588 --> 01:03:22,686
[knocks on door]

1199
01:03:22,688 --> 01:03:24,457
[Peter] Richard? Richard.

1200
01:03:26,293 --> 01:03:27,592
Oh, oh, Richard.

1201
01:03:27,594 --> 01:03:29,697
Oh, no, no, no.
Richard, are you all right?

1202
01:03:30,463 --> 01:03:31,465
Christ.

1203
01:03:32,498 --> 01:03:34,199
- Angels.
- What?

1204
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:37,405
I hear the angels, Peter,
they're singing.

1205
01:03:37,603 --> 01:03:40,340
No, that's the... that's
the acapella group, Richard.

1206
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:42,209
Here.

1207
01:03:43,108 --> 01:03:45,545
Why? Why do we have
an acapella group?

1208
01:03:46,179 --> 01:03:48,182
We've always had
an acapella group.

1209
01:03:49,715 --> 01:03:52,684
Well, fuck them.
Can you take me to the bells?

1210
01:03:52,686 --> 01:03:54,989
- What?
- I wanna see the bells.

1211
01:03:55,222 --> 01:03:56,624
- The bells?
- Yeah.

1212
01:03:57,356 --> 01:04:00,391
All right. All right. Come.

1213
01:04:00,393 --> 01:04:02,429
[Peter] I'll get you
some water first.

1214
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:20,580
[wood creaking]

1215
01:04:28,755 --> 01:04:30,057
Peter,

1216
01:04:31,157 --> 01:04:35,395
there are a lot of other
good places to sit in here.

1217
01:04:36,195 --> 01:04:37,498
Hmm, yes.

1218
01:04:38,364 --> 01:04:39,466
Of course.

1219
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:41,201
Yeah.

1220
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:47,440
[wood creaking]

1221
01:04:56,615 --> 01:04:57,617
[exhales]

1222
01:05:02,422 --> 01:05:03,791
Can you feel anything?

1223
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,793
No.

1224
01:05:08,628 --> 01:05:10,097
But I enjoy the lighting.

1225
01:05:11,197 --> 01:05:13,266
- You?
- No.

1226
01:05:14,601 --> 01:05:16,070
But that's all right.

1227
01:05:20,806 --> 01:05:23,309
Please mother of God,
help my friend...

1228
01:05:23,677 --> 01:05:25,346
Afraid it's starting to kick in.

1229
01:05:27,813 --> 01:05:29,115
Does it hurt?

1230
01:05:30,516 --> 01:05:31,684
Oh, fuck yeah.

1231
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:33,521
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1232
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,556
I'll manage.

1233
01:05:35,822 --> 01:05:37,525
[emotive music]

1234
01:05:39,326 --> 01:05:41,695
It's fine, Peter.
We knew this was coming.

1235
01:05:43,362 --> 01:05:44,364
Yeah.

1236
01:05:46,666 --> 01:05:48,365
I mean, uh,
I look back on everything,

1237
01:05:48,367 --> 01:05:50,703
and it all somehow
makes so much sense.

1238
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:54,774
It's as though, uh,
it couldn't be any other way.

1239
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:03,384
Why's our soul broken?

1240
01:06:04,617 --> 01:06:06,253
Absurd.

1241
01:06:07,586 --> 01:06:08,722
Yet...

1242
01:06:09,922 --> 01:06:11,357
It's perfect.

1243
01:06:13,626 --> 01:06:16,528
And it's also perfect
when you look at it.

1244
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:18,432
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1245
01:06:32,711 --> 01:06:34,648
It's gonna be hard
to leave this place.

1246
01:06:39,452 --> 01:06:41,489
It's gonna be hard
to say goodbye.

1247
01:06:42,856 --> 01:06:45,659
Richard, I'm gonna miss you.

1248
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:50,164
I'm gonna miss you too, Peter.
If I'm able.

1249
01:06:52,632 --> 01:06:54,831
Fuck, I'm going to cry.

1250
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:56,402
- No.
- Dear God.

1251
01:06:56,603 --> 01:06:58,302
- Please.
- [groans]

1252
01:06:58,304 --> 01:06:59,804
Please don't do this.
No, no, shh.

1253
01:06:59,806 --> 01:07:01,842
- Dammit.
- No, no, no. Listen.

1254
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:04,309
I really prefer
if you didn't cry.

1255
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:06,844
- [sniffles]
- Listen to me. We tried.

1256
01:07:06,846 --> 01:07:10,351
- Yes. Yes.
- Now let's go. Come on.

1257
01:07:10,717 --> 01:07:12,483
- [sniffles]
- Come on.

1258
01:07:12,485 --> 01:07:13,487
Okay.

1259
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,787
- I'm sorry.
- Come on.

1260
01:07:15,789 --> 01:07:17,224
It's all right.

1261
01:07:18,525 --> 01:07:19,626
Come on, Peter.

1262
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:23,364
- [Peter sighs]
- Oh.

1263
01:07:30,336 --> 01:07:31,938
You're a good man, Richard.

1264
01:07:32,806 --> 01:07:34,407
So are you, my friend.

1265
01:07:35,809 --> 01:07:37,675
[Richard] Thank you for being
so good to me.

1266
01:07:37,677 --> 01:07:40,948
I'm trying, Richard.
I'm trying.

1267
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:46,316
[Richard] Isn't it strange
how natural this feels?

1268
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:48,286
- [Peter] Yeah.
- [Richard] Two men,

1269
01:07:48,288 --> 01:07:50,925
holding one another,
passionately, in a church.

1270
01:07:51,625 --> 01:07:54,195
Groping one another freely.

1271
01:07:54,594 --> 01:07:56,730
[both laughing]

1272
01:07:57,297 --> 01:07:58,331
[Peter] Yeah.

1273
01:07:59,432 --> 01:08:00,501
- Oh, you're stupid.
- [Richard] Come on you, pervert.

1274
01:08:02,402 --> 01:08:03,737
[footsteps]

1275
01:08:18,818 --> 01:08:20,421
[wood creaking]

1276
01:08:23,856 --> 01:08:24,858
Hey.

1277
01:08:26,626 --> 01:08:27,628
Bye.

1278
01:08:30,329 --> 01:08:31,696
You're going out tonight?

1279
01:08:31,698 --> 01:08:32,700
Yeah.

1280
01:08:33,733 --> 01:08:34,735
Okay.

1281
01:08:35,734 --> 01:08:37,337
You have fun, okay?

1282
01:08:38,872 --> 01:08:39,940
Yeah, you, too.

1283
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:45,576
I'm not sure that's possible,
but I'm promising you

1284
01:08:45,578 --> 01:08:47,014
that we will try.

1285
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:51,784
Go get 'em, kid.

1286
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:58,292
Bye, dad.

1287
01:09:02,362 --> 01:09:04,864
[door opens, closes]

1288
01:09:05,564 --> 01:09:06,966
[piano playing]

1289
01:09:12,505 --> 01:09:15,639
[Henry] Thank you so much
for coming, really.

1290
01:09:15,641 --> 01:09:18,545
Oh, oh, you get just lovelier
every year.

1291
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:22,383
Veronica, Richard.
Our guest of honor.

1292
01:09:22,849 --> 01:09:24,048
So nice you could make it.

1293
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:25,782
Oh, we wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1294
01:09:25,784 --> 01:09:27,020
How do you do?
Hi, I'm Richard.

1295
01:09:28,087 --> 01:09:30,021
Oh, okay.

1296
01:09:30,023 --> 01:09:31,792
That's a hell of a greeting.

1297
01:09:34,527 --> 01:09:36,663
[Richard] I'm going to the bar.

1298
01:09:39,798 --> 01:09:40,801
Hi.

1299
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,403
Hi.

1300
01:09:43,404 --> 01:09:44,869
Peter and I have decided
to stay in this year,

1301
01:09:44,871 --> 01:09:46,937
and spend Christmas in Miami.

1302
01:09:46,939 --> 01:09:49,741
- [Richard] Hello.
- Oh, how fashionable.

1303
01:09:49,743 --> 01:09:52,610
Donna, you weren't
at my birthday party. Why?

1304
01:09:52,612 --> 01:09:53,780
[gulps loudly]

1305
01:09:54,847 --> 01:09:57,048
I've been so wanting to tell you

1306
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:59,416
- that I mixed up the date.
- Oh.

1307
01:09:59,418 --> 01:10:01,686
Excuse me everyone,
if I could have your attention.

1308
01:10:01,688 --> 01:10:04,755
Dinner is to be served shortly,
so, if you would be so kind

1309
01:10:04,757 --> 01:10:06,723
as to begin migrating
to the dining room,

1310
01:10:06,725 --> 01:10:08,461
that would be much appreciated.

1311
01:10:09,595 --> 01:10:11,764
[piano playing]

1312
01:10:12,966 --> 01:10:15,566
Veronica.
You'll be right here next to me.

1313
01:10:15,568 --> 01:10:17,067
- Richard.
- [Richard coughs]

1314
01:10:17,069 --> 01:10:18,969
Uh, no, no, no.
Tight Quarters, I'm afraid.

1315
01:10:18,971 --> 01:10:20,440
He'll be somewhere in the back.

1316
01:10:20,907 --> 01:10:22,909
[indistinct chatter]

1317
01:10:26,613 --> 01:10:27,648
Hello, everyone.

1318
01:10:28,614 --> 01:10:32,583
Um, sorry, why isn't Richard
sitting at this table?

1319
01:10:32,585 --> 01:10:34,050
I can assure you
that there has been

1320
01:10:34,052 --> 01:10:35,553
a great deal of thought

1321
01:10:35,555 --> 01:10:37,591
that's going
into the seating arrangements.

1322
01:10:42,962 --> 01:10:43,964
What?

1323
01:10:44,163 --> 01:10:45,729
Dead, gone.

1324
01:10:45,731 --> 01:10:48,569
Oh, that's horrible.
What was it?

1325
01:10:48,835 --> 01:10:51,102
Oh, melanoma, I'm afraid.

1326
01:10:51,104 --> 01:10:54,608
[woman] Oh. Oh, welcome,
young man.

1327
01:10:55,908 --> 01:10:57,474
And the families?

1328
01:10:57,476 --> 01:10:58,679
Honestly,

1329
01:10:58,877 --> 01:11:00,945
- you don't wanna know.
- Oh, really?

1330
01:11:00,947 --> 01:11:02,612
[glass clinking]

1331
01:11:02,614 --> 01:11:04,615
- [indistinct chatter]
- [music stops]

1332
01:11:04,617 --> 01:11:06,483
While everyone's being served,

1333
01:11:06,485 --> 01:11:08,622
I just wanted to say
a couple words.

1334
01:11:08,854 --> 01:11:13,023
On behalf of both myself
and my lovely wife, welcome.

1335
01:11:13,025 --> 01:11:14,592
It's an honor to have each

1336
01:11:14,594 --> 01:11:16,561
and every one of you
here tonight.

1337
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:20,033
Now, I know I'm not alone
when I say that this quarter

1338
01:11:20,233 --> 01:11:22,536
may have been our very best.

1339
01:11:22,902 --> 01:11:25,135
And the opportunity to serve,

1340
01:11:25,137 --> 01:11:27,507
as your president
and chancellor,

1341
01:11:27,707 --> 01:11:31,412
has been nothing short
of humbling.

1342
01:11:31,743 --> 01:11:33,110
[indistinct chatter]

1343
01:11:33,112 --> 01:11:34,644
So thank you.

1344
01:11:34,646 --> 01:11:36,182
I can only hope

1345
01:11:36,649 --> 01:11:39,616
to live up to the high standards
that you have set.

1346
01:11:39,618 --> 01:11:41,184
- [woman] We will.
- [All] Cheers.

1347
01:11:41,186 --> 01:11:45,055
Now, let us eat
for the night is young.

1348
01:11:45,057 --> 01:11:46,656
[indistinct chatter]

1349
01:11:46,658 --> 01:11:47,959
[applause]

1350
01:11:47,961 --> 01:11:50,928
Oh, that was a lovely speech.

1351
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:51,795
Beautiful.

1352
01:11:51,797 --> 01:11:53,599
Did you actually
buy that shit, really?

1353
01:11:54,501 --> 01:11:55,502
Excuse me?

1354
01:11:56,435 --> 01:11:58,905
Are you in the
communications department?

1355
01:11:59,104 --> 01:12:00,706
[piano playing in background]

1356
01:12:01,274 --> 01:12:03,577
[indistinct chatter]

1357
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:05,846
[laughter]

1358
01:12:19,559 --> 01:12:20,961
[glass clinking]

1359
01:12:27,966 --> 01:12:30,170
I have something
that I would like to say.

1360
01:12:32,604 --> 01:12:34,037
Could you stop playing that

1361
01:12:34,039 --> 01:12:36,240
before I heave this knife
in your direction?

1362
01:12:36,242 --> 01:12:37,875
- [woman gasps]
- [Richard] Thank you.

1363
01:12:37,877 --> 01:12:39,710
Uh, young lady with the wine,
would you mind

1364
01:12:39,712 --> 01:12:42,616
just standing right by my side,
and never leave?

1365
01:12:42,981 --> 01:12:44,851
Because I have much to say

1366
01:12:45,784 --> 01:12:47,985
- and many to toast.
- Oh, my God.

1367
01:12:47,987 --> 01:12:51,123
Those of you who do not know,
my name is Richard Brown.

1368
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:53,527
Professor of English.

1369
01:12:53,859 --> 01:12:56,229
Oh, uh, cheers to me.

1370
01:12:57,063 --> 01:12:58,295
[All] Cheers.

1371
01:12:58,297 --> 01:13:00,000
- Cheers.
- [Peter] To Richard.

1372
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,303
Henry Wright, on behalf
of every one of us here,

1373
01:13:05,305 --> 01:13:08,775
let me, please, express
our gratitude,

1374
01:13:09,876 --> 01:13:12,943
- for this finely forced evening.
- I'm sorry.

1375
01:13:12,945 --> 01:13:14,911
[Richard] The commitment
that you have shown

1376
01:13:14,913 --> 01:13:19,584
to the students, faculty,
even the wives of the faculty...

1377
01:13:19,586 --> 01:13:21,251
[gasps, laughter]

1378
01:13:21,253 --> 01:13:22,956
...is very, very impressive.

1379
01:13:23,256 --> 01:13:24,825
You've outdone yourself.

1380
01:13:26,259 --> 01:13:27,293
And it shows.

1381
01:13:28,595 --> 01:13:32,099
As far as I'm concerned,
three balls...

1382
01:13:32,966 --> 01:13:34,968
- deserves three cheers.
- [Veronica] No.

1383
01:13:35,801 --> 01:13:37,668
All right, Richard,
I think that's enough.

1384
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:41,004
Henry, do not
interrupt me while I'm talking.

1385
01:13:41,006 --> 01:13:43,040
Particularly in front
of so many people.

1386
01:13:43,042 --> 01:13:45,041
- Do you understand?
- No, I don't understand.

1387
01:13:45,043 --> 01:13:46,143
Yeah.

1388
01:13:46,145 --> 01:13:47,644
[woman] Nobody has
three testicles.

1389
01:13:47,646 --> 01:13:48,845
[Richard] To Peter Matthew.

1390
01:13:48,847 --> 01:13:50,080
- Oh.
- [woman] Oh.

1391
01:13:50,082 --> 01:13:51,182
Gotta shut up.

1392
01:13:51,184 --> 01:13:52,282
[laughs]

1393
01:13:52,284 --> 01:13:54,285
Your heart is truly
one of gold.

1394
01:13:54,287 --> 01:13:56,890
- [Barbara] It is.
- And this college is...

1395
01:13:57,122 --> 01:13:59,190
- very lucky to have you.
- [Barbara] Hmm, that's true.

1396
01:13:59,192 --> 01:14:01,659
Of course, thank you
for your hard work.

1397
01:14:01,661 --> 01:14:04,597
But most important, thank you

1398
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:06,696
for being a true friend.

1399
01:14:06,698 --> 01:14:08,398
- [Barbara] Oh, to Peter, cheers.
- [All] Cheers.

1400
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,834
[man] To Peter.

1401
01:14:09,836 --> 01:14:12,637
Also there are some
parting words

1402
01:14:12,639 --> 01:14:14,908
that I feel like I owe.

1403
01:14:15,707 --> 01:14:17,808
Because this will be
the last time

1404
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:19,910
that I ever see any of you.

1405

a sabbatical, um...

1407
01:14:26,918 --> 01:14:28,788
[Barbara] This is strange,
Peter.

1408
01:14:31,724 --> 01:14:33,260
...I'm gonna die.

1409
01:14:34,793 --> 01:14:36,630
Yeah... [laughs]

1410
01:14:37,063 --> 01:14:39,129
- I'm gonna die,
- [indistinct chatter]

1411
01:14:39,131 --> 01:14:43,200
and I'm gonna die much sooner
than I had imagined.

1413
01:14:45,671 --> 01:14:47,006
Oh, my goodness.

1414
01:14:49,074 --> 01:14:50,307
I know, dear.

1415
01:14:50,309 --> 01:14:53,076
- What is he talking about?
- Shh.

1416
01:14:53,078 --> 01:14:55,715
So in preparing
for what lies ahead,

1417
01:14:56,215 --> 01:14:59,619
I've come to realize
that for much of my life,

1418
01:15:00,987 --> 01:15:02,355
I've been mistaken,

1419
01:15:03,989 --> 01:15:05,990
and I failed.

1420
01:15:05,992 --> 01:15:10,963
I failed, not only
to comprehend my mortality,

1421
01:15:11,963 --> 01:15:13,699
but I've failed
to appreciate it.

1422
01:15:14,734 --> 01:15:16,103
And as a result,

1423
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:21,707
I've failed to make
the most of my life.

1424
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:26,410
Veronica,
you're one hell of a sport.

1425
01:15:26,412 --> 01:15:29,716
You are a very worthy adversary.

1426
01:15:30,416 --> 01:15:31,685
Proud...

1427
01:15:32,952 --> 01:15:34,887
to have been able
to call you my wife.

1428
01:15:36,088 --> 01:15:38,955
Because life without you
would've been, uh,

1429
01:15:38,957 --> 01:15:40,126
far less rich.

1430
01:15:40,393 --> 01:15:42,095
And for that, I thank you.

1431
01:15:44,296 --> 01:15:45,865
For whatever it's worth...

1432
01:15:52,037 --> 01:15:53,205
I love you...

1433
01:15:54,039 --> 01:15:55,042
deeply.

1434
01:15:55,774 --> 01:15:57,009
I know.

1435
01:16:00,947 --> 01:16:05,081
We've turned our backs
on the most important duty

1436
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:06,720
that we possess,

1437
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:10,323
to live a life
that is rich in experience

1438
01:16:13,091 --> 01:16:15,327
that's of our own
independent choosing.

1439
01:16:16,496 --> 01:16:19,065
Seize your fucking existence,
folks.

1440
01:16:19,297 --> 01:16:22,301
Why don't we make death
our closest fucking companion,

1441
01:16:22,801 --> 01:16:26,803
so that we can finally
have a second,

1442
01:16:26,805 --> 01:16:29,009
a millisecond to appreciate

1443
01:16:29,542 --> 01:16:31,778
that little bit of time
that we have left.

1444
01:16:32,145 --> 01:16:34,147
And most important of all,

1445
01:16:34,514 --> 01:16:36,048
let us live well,

1446
01:16:37,149 --> 01:16:39,085
so that
we may fucking die well,

1447
01:16:40,051 --> 01:16:42,788
because we've never been
so close to death

1448
01:16:43,288 --> 01:16:44,925
than this very moment.

1449
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:46,792
[All] Cheers.

[Henry] Dammit, Richard.
Those are crystal.

1453
01:17:20,592 --> 01:17:21,991
I'm so sorry

1454
01:17:21,993 --> 01:17:23,960
that you had
to find out like that,

1455
01:17:23,962 --> 01:17:25,331
and I just didn't...

1456
01:17:26,164 --> 01:17:28,098
I mean, I honestly didn't know
how to tell you.

1457
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,302
I was scared.

1458
01:17:32,371 --> 01:17:33,974
What are you gonna do?

1459
01:17:35,474 --> 01:17:37,310
I'm gonna leave, sweetheart.

1460
01:17:38,511 --> 01:17:40,380
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

1461
01:17:48,554 --> 01:17:52,057
Please, try and find
some happiness.

1462
01:17:53,525 --> 01:17:54,961
I'm working on it.

1463
01:17:55,862 --> 01:17:56,962
I know you will.

1464
01:18:01,466 --> 01:18:03,170
Goodbye, Richard.

1465
01:18:25,291 --> 01:18:26,560
Goodbye, Veronica.

1466
01:18:29,161 --> 01:18:30,262
Bye.

1467

[door opens, closes]

1468
01:19:07,466 --> 01:19:11,338
Olivia?
What are you doing home, baby?

1469
01:19:12,371 --> 01:19:13,940
Taylor broke up with me.

1470
01:19:15,073 --> 01:19:17,074
- What?
- She cheated on me

1471
01:19:17,076 --> 01:19:18,612
with Nathan Runnings.

1472
01:19:20,512 --> 01:19:22,215
[Richard]
Professor Runnings' kid?

1473
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:25,385
Mm-hmm.

1474
01:19:28,988 --> 01:19:30,923
Listen. Hey.

1475
01:19:34,493 --> 01:19:36,229
Come on, babe. Come here.

1476
01:19:36,462 --> 01:19:37,464
Come here.

1477
01:19:40,332 --> 01:19:42,469
Don't worry, sweetheart.
You're gonna be fine.

1478
01:19:43,703 --> 01:19:45,405
The world's full of women

1479
01:19:46,271 --> 01:19:48,007
looking for someone to love.

1480
01:19:48,207 --> 01:19:50,677
There's gotta be somebody
who deserves you.

1481
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:56,516
- What'll you have?
- I don't care.

1482
01:19:57,582 --> 01:20:00,651
[Richard] Well, when a man
loses a woman,

1483
01:20:00,653 --> 01:20:03,490
it's, uh, typically whiskey
he drinks.

1484
01:20:06,591 --> 01:20:07,626
So,

1485
01:20:08,694 --> 01:20:11,398
I'm kind of
assuming that, um,

1486
01:20:13,131 --> 01:20:15,000
a lesbian would do the same.

1487
01:20:21,006 --> 01:20:22,138

To Taylor rotting in hell.

1492
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:42,963
And yes,
to Taylor rotting in hell.

Cheers.

1494

[Richard] I'm so proud of you.

1495
01:21:02,614 --> 01:21:03,615
Why?

1496
01:21:07,586 --> 01:21:10,523
[Richard] Because you possess
everything

1497
01:21:10,823 --> 01:21:13,727
that a father could ever want

1498
01:21:14,426 --> 01:21:16,429
in a daughter, and more.

1499
01:21:17,328 --> 01:21:18,597
So much more.

Are you okay?
