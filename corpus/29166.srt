1
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:53,509
Riggs, Homicide.

2
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:55,028
-Nobody's dead.
-The night's young.

3
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,867
This is Sergeant Murtaugh.

4
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:58,354
-Threat or scare?
-Real thing.

5
00:01:58,435 --> 00:01:59,914
He saw the device.

6
00:02:00,075 --> 00:02:03,147
It's on Level 1, by the gas pumps.
I wrote the license plate number.

7
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:04,907
That's okay, sir. Thanks a lot.

8
00:02:04,995 --> 00:02:07,111
-You evacuated the building?
-It's clean.

9
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:08,628
-Where's the bomb squad?
-Coming.

10
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:10,865
Good. It's under control. Let's go.

11
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:13,150
I think we ought to check this out.

12
00:02:14,195 --> 00:02:15,264
What?

13
00:02:15,675 --> 00:02:17,745
-Bomb squad's coming.
-There's no bomb!

14
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:20,269
-How do you know?
-Because it's a full moon.

15
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:22,550
Moon, lunar, lunatics. They're everywhere.

16
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:24,353
-Is that Greek?
-No, Latin.

17
00:02:24,675 --> 00:02:26,506
You surprise the shit out of me.

18
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:28,870
There's no bomb.
It's probably a false alarm.

19
00:02:28,955 --> 00:02:31,469
It happens. He probably saw a radio
on the back seat.

20
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:33,989
Let's not mess with it.
Wait for the bomb squad.

21
00:02:34,075 --> 00:02:36,828
You're right. You sit tight,
I'll be right back.

22
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:38,913
What's the matter with you?

23
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:41,225
-There's a bomb in there!
-No, there's not.

24
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:42,953
-There's a bomb in there!
-There is not!

25
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:44,184
There's a bomb in there!

26
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:45,867
-You know how I know?
-How?

27
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:49,072
I've got eight days till retirement
and I won't make a stupid mistake.

28
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:52,147
There is no bomb!
I'll bet vital parts of my anatomy!

29
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:53,270
Look.

30
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:55,789
Trust me. Okay?

31
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:02,305
That's usually my first mistake.

32
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:06,032
Hey, wait. I'm coming.

33
00:03:06,315 --> 00:03:07,384
Rog?

34
00:03:07,595 --> 00:03:10,155
-Is your insurance paid up?
-Of course. Why?

35
00:03:10,475 --> 00:03:13,114
-There could be a bomb in here.
-Oh, God!

36
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:19,225
-I hate it when I'm right.
-Learn to trust your instincts more.

37
00:03:19,315 --> 00:03:20,384
Oh, God.

38
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:23,914
The first impression
can often be the right one.

39
00:03:26,635 --> 00:03:28,546
Drive shaft...I wonder if there's a bomb.

40
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:30,387
Just don't touch it.

41
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:33,028
Just looking.

42
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:41,272
What are you doing?
Don't open the door! Don't!

43
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:47,666
Son of a bitch, just look at it.

44
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:49,666
That's all I'll do, just look.

45
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:54,785
There's more plastic than Cher.

46
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:57,231
I love this job. This is amateur night.

47
00:03:57,315 --> 00:03:58,794
Open the door. I can't hear you.

48
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,354
Open the door.

49
00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:02,068
Don't do nothing.

50
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:04,708
Not that one!

51
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:06,308
You son of a bitch.

52
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:09,273
This is a pretty shonky job.
I can dismantle it.

53
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:11,784
It looks like Beirut to me. Let's go!

54
00:04:15,275 --> 00:04:18,711
Everybody's outside. Just me, you
and the cat are dumb enough to be here.

55
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:20,945
Nearly a cat-tastrophe, huh?

56
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:23,906
-Relax, Rog. Relax.
-Right.

57
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:24,791
Don't do nothing.

58
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:28,345
We've got 9 minutes and 7 seconds left.
You know what we can do?

59
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,829
We could drive it out.

60
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:31,428
Fine, it's your turn to drive.

61
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:33,392
No keys. I could hot-wire it.

62
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:36,544
Don't even say "hot-wire"
around this stuff!

63
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:37,590
You're right.

64
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:39,506
Why am I doing this? Why?

65
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:42,514
I'm going to have to do it
the old-fashioned way.

66
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:44,233
What are you thinking?

67
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:46,147
What are you thinking?

68
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:49,470
-I'm thinking we should cut the blue wire.
-Wait!

69
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,432
-That's not what I think.
-You think maybe the red?

70
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:52,743
No! No!

71
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:55,509
I'm thinking it's 8 minutes and 42 seconds.

72
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:58,911
We can go upstairs, wait for
the bomb squad, and have a cappuccino.

73
00:04:58,995 --> 00:05:02,590
The bomb squad never gets here on time.
And it's 8 minutes, 31 seconds.

74
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:03,869
Rog, please.

75
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:04,985
Forget the cappuccino.

76
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:08,272
-You know what they'll say?
-"Get the fuck out of here!"

77
00:05:08,515 --> 00:05:12,508
But then they'll say: "Let's cut
the blue wire", which I'll do right now.

78
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:14,467
-Wait, wait!
-What?

79
00:05:14,835 --> 00:05:15,984
How can you be so sure?

80
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:17,110
It's just a hunch.

81
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:18,230
A hunch?

82
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:19,714
Remember the bomb under your toilet?

83
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:22,593
-How could I forget?
-Red wire, blue wire, same thing.

84
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:25,667
This is more simplified,
but a bit more powerful.

85
00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:27,666
From where I sat, I couldn't see.

86
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:29,154
Forget it. Come on, trust me.

87
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:30,463
Trust you?

88
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:33,149
Guess not. I'm cutting the red wire, okay?

89
00:05:35,755 --> 00:05:36,870
What? What?

90
00:05:36,955 --> 00:05:38,991
A minute ago you said blue!

91
00:05:39,915 --> 00:05:40,791
I did?

92
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,024
You said blue!

93
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:44,074
-I meant red.
-Sure?

94
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:45,908
We can do it your way.

95
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:48,065
-My way? I don't have...
-Quiet!

96
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:49,270
I'm sure, okay?

97
00:05:49,355 --> 00:05:50,629
Ah, shit!

98
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,350
Ready?

99
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:56,031
Rog?

100
00:05:56,115 --> 00:05:57,025
What?

101
00:05:57,515 --> 00:06:00,393
Won't you miss all this good stuff
when you retire?

102
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:02,631
Won't you miss it a little bit?

103
00:06:05,395 --> 00:06:06,953
I'm cutting the wire.

104
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:08,907
Snip. All done.

105
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:15,030
Grab the cat!

106
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:16,389
Grab the cat?

107
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:18,466
Get out of there! Take cover!

108
00:07:16,915 --> 00:07:18,189
Where are they?

109
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:24,310
Bravo.

110
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:30,350
Whoops.

111
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:33,748
Right. Whoops.

112
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:37,424
Right.

113
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,907
Seven days till retirement,
I'm busted down to patrolman.

114
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:47,872
I should've cut the red wire.

115
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:50,585
-You did.
-No, I cut the blue wire.

116
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:52,267
That's what I meant.

117
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:55,472
-We should've waited for the bomb squad.
-Must I hear this every day?

118
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:58,592
-Every day until I retire!
-That'll be a week too long.

119
00:07:59,635 --> 00:08:01,785
-My feet are killing me.
-They're killing me, too.

120
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:04,264
-How?
-I have to listen to you bitch about them!

121
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:07,870
-Because you should've cut the red wire!
-I did cut the red wire!

122
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:10,070
What's this?

123
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:12,032
It's kind of soft...not a bulletproof vest.

124
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:13,389
It won't keep anything out.

125
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:15,227
It'll keep my stomach in.

126
00:08:15,315 --> 00:08:17,146
What've you got under there?

127
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:18,989
It's a girdle.

128
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:20,190
What?

129
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:22,624
It's a girdle!

130
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:24,430
Does Trish know?

131
00:08:24,515 --> 00:08:26,631
It's not a woman's girdle.
It's a man's girdle!

132
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,831
-They make girdles for men?
-Yeah!

133
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:30,268
-They do?
-Yeah, they do!

134
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:32,027
I haven't worn this uniform in 15 years!

135
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:35,312
-Cleaners must have shrunk it.
-You should take it to Chin.

136
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:38,910
I did take it to Chin. Look at it.
It shrunk all up in here.

137
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:40,827
I have to hold my breath.

138
00:08:40,915 --> 00:08:42,030
Did you see that?

139
00:08:42,115 --> 00:08:43,787
-See what?
-Jaywalker.

140
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,030
Jaywalking?

141
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:48,745
Hold it right there, pal.
Step up here, please.

142
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:50,109
-Me?
-Yes, you.

143
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:51,754
-What'd I do?
-Stand there.

144
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:54,668
Jaywalking. I saw you.
I'll have to cite you.

145
00:08:54,755 --> 00:08:57,064
Jaywalking? Oh, Jesus, come on!

146
00:08:57,355 --> 00:09:00,791
-Should I radio for backup?
-Smart-ass. Can you get the ticket book?

147
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,831
You're hassling me for...

148
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:04,503
Shut up!

149
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:11,311
-Do you know how to fill one of these out?
-A long time ago.

150
00:09:11,715 --> 00:09:15,025
I can't read it. The print is too small
without my glasses.

151
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:18,666
Can we speed this up?
You may have nothing to do, but I do.

152
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:21,144
No, we can't, so will you shut up?

153
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,866
-Jaywalking.
-Ask for his license.

154
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:25,707
-License, for jaywalking?
-Yeah.

155
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:28,593
I don't have it on me. I wasn't driving.

156
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:31,269
I was walking.
Do I need a walking license now?

157
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:33,226
-Let's just shoot him!
-Is he crazy?

158
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:36,148
I'm going to drill him!
We'll make it look like suicide!

159
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:38,988
-Get out of the way!
-No, the video cameras!

160
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:40,827
I don't care! I'll drill him!

161
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,473
Get out of here, before he kills you!

162
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:45,388
-Go that way! Not that way!
-This way! Over here!

163
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:46,464
-Run!
-Now!

164
00:09:46,555 --> 00:09:47,624
Run!

165
00:09:58,275 --> 00:09:59,628
Wait a minute!

166
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:01,673
You forgot to sign!

167
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:05,189
What was that?

168
00:10:05,715 --> 00:10:08,183
Wait a minute.
You forgot to sign the form.

169
00:10:08,635 --> 00:10:09,624
Who're you?

170
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:11,114
You're not the regular guy?

171
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:13,470
-He's on vacation.
-On vacation?

172
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:15,467
Well, who the hell is that?

173
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,514
Get in the truck!

174
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,348
You fucking prick!

175
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,194
Are you a cop?

176
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,427
Fourteen-sixty. Into pursuit.
Will continue transmission.

177
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:39,550
Call 911.

178
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:42,433
Okay, honey. Let me drive.
We're in pursuit.

179
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:44,586
I'm driving! Don't worry.

180
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:54,272
This fool picked the wrong time
to mess with the wrong lady.

181
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:55,788
Just stay close!

182
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,633
Right behind you, baby!

183
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:05,349
Take a good look!

184
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:08,393
Delores the Road Warrior
is dead on your raggedy ass!

185
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:17,983
Ram him!

186
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:26,107
-Watch out, Riggs!
-Come on!

187
00:11:34,675 --> 00:11:35,710
Are you married, sugar?

188
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,104
What? Yes, 24 years! 24 years!

189
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:39,947
Yeah, but is it working?

190
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:47,873
-You can't get closer?
-I am! I'm getting closer.

191
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:51,225
Hold on, Riggs!

192
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:52,270
Hold on!

193
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:03,152
Hold on! Hold on! We got you!

194
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:04,429
Hold on!

195
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:07,471
-I told you I could!
-Closer!

196
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:09,352
-Get me up there!
-Go!

197
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:10,630
I am! I am!

198
00:12:15,755 --> 00:12:16,744
Back off!

199
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:30,069
If he falls, don't hit him!

200
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:32,544
Don't worry, I've got something for you!

201
00:13:09,515 --> 00:13:12,587
Thanks for the interest, sugar,
but one thing at a time!

202
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:27,953
-Catch him!
-All right!

203
00:13:30,515 --> 00:13:32,551
Keep singing! Just stay close!

204
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:41,194
Relax, baby. Relax.

205
00:13:41,435 --> 00:13:43,346
Keep your hands off my thighs!

206
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:45,944
-He's in trouble. Watch out!
-I got him!

207
00:13:58,435 --> 00:13:59,993
I'm getting too old for this.

208
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:01,986
Not for me, you're not, sugar.

209
00:14:05,315 --> 00:14:07,704
You have the right to remain unconscious.

210
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:10,584
Anything you say ain't gonna be much.

211
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:16,313
Hey, Riggs. Are you all right?

212
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:20,434
I'm okay. I guess we'll have to book
this guy for not wearing his seat belt.

213
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:22,392
That was dynamite driving.

214
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:25,626
-She's a dynamite driver!
-I'll show you dynamite!

215
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:27,914
Sho 'nuff!

216
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:31,226
What have you two been up to?

217
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:32,834
What do you mean? We were in pursuit!

218
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,304
-I saw you kiss her.
-She kissed me!

219
00:14:35,395 --> 00:14:38,387
It looked mutual to me.
Wipe that lipstick off.

220
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:40,227
Hey, go spit, Riggs!

221
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:43,469
Are you okay?

222
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:44,954
Are you all right?

223
00:14:45,235 --> 00:14:46,429
Back to bed. Back to bed.

224
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:49,505
Good morning, guys. Daddy.

225
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,708
How about treating your dad
to breakfast today?

226
00:14:53,755 --> 00:14:56,633
-You've got six more days to go.
-Laundry service.

227
00:14:58,275 --> 00:14:59,708
Hold this. Hangers?

228
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:03,071
I'm springing for the soap.
Nothing too fancy. Cute dog.

229
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,463
It's a Westie.

230
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:06,229
'Morning, Trish.

231
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:07,989
'Morning, Rog.

232
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:10,309
-Good morning, Nick.
-Spare me.

233
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:13,193
-What, you didn't brush your teeth?
-Hold it, mister!

234
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:15,027
Just looking for some orange juice.

235
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:18,471
Don't get any fingerprints on the door
and put the glass in the dishwasher.

236
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:20,147
Did somebody commit a murder?

237
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:22,271
Someone's coming to see the house.

238
00:15:22,395 --> 00:15:24,784
I think a little mess adds to the charm.

239
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,828
How's this?

240
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,511
Isn't this great? Okay? Okay?

241
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:40,788
Kelly's Pool Hall.

242
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,548
Right, Kelly, hi. Let me speak to Dad.

243
00:15:43,835 --> 00:15:47,464
Hi, honey. How are you?
I thought I asked you not to call me here.

244
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:49,427
-It's for you.
-Me?

245
00:15:52,155 --> 00:15:53,827
Who is it? Hello?

246
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:57,584
Hi. It's my first day at work. Are you
going to come by and wish me luck?

247
00:15:57,675 --> 00:16:00,792
-Beautiful, huh? Come on, check it out.
-Beautiful lawn.

248
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:01,990
It's great.

249
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:04,385
See how quiet it is here? Listen.

250
00:16:04,635 --> 00:16:05,988
Isn't that great? Come on.

251
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:08,145
-It's quiet.
-The inside's even better.

252
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:11,272
-It's the people to look at the house.
-And our broker.

253
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:16,193
Just want to make sure.

254
00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:19,034
I'll show you this room first.
It's my favorite.

255
00:16:20,715 --> 00:16:23,024
-Is that it? Does that say it all?
-It's very nice.

256
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,026
I love that picture window.

257
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:28,989
-It's just been completely replaced.
-Why?

258
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:31,873
A drug dealer came through with his car
and crashed right in.

259
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:33,673
Shot up the whole place.

260
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,867
Son of a bitch!
I'm going to cut him off at the knees!

261
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:41,465
It's true. It's true. True.
Okay, okay, anyway, look.

262
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:43,989
Do you like the drapes?
Maybe she'll leave them.

263
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:45,827
-I thought you quit.
-I did.

264
00:16:46,035 --> 00:16:49,232
-You'll stink up the house. Don't smoke.
-I'm itching to.

265
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:50,870
Here.

266
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:52,949
Chew on these.

267
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:57,063
I have to tell you this. It's the law.
It's called "full disclosure".

268
00:16:57,235 --> 00:17:00,113
Anything else you want to disclose
before we go on?

269
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:04,185
Now that you mention it, the bathroom
has been completely remodeled...

270
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:06,027
...due to unexpected bomb damage.

271
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:07,594
Hey, come on. It's okay.

272
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:09,108
Son of a bitch!

273
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,755
Don't, don't. You'll never sell the house.

274
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:18,910
Okay, okay. We saw enough of the kitchen.

275
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:23,466
I'll show you the upstairs. Wait till
you see it. It's beautiful. You'll love it.

276
00:17:27,835 --> 00:17:30,508
They're gone. Leo Getz,
I'm going to kill him!

277
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:32,950
Son of a bitch! I'm going to kill him!

278
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:34,946
You have to let me, Riggs!

279
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:38,753
They weren't going to buy it anyway!

280
00:17:38,835 --> 00:17:41,872
-You scared them away!
-They couldn't afford to buy it!

281
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:43,911
-Oh, I see.
-Okay, relax.

282
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:47,831
I had to tell them everything.
It's the law. "Full disclosure".

283
00:17:47,915 --> 00:17:50,907
-You must have heard of it?
-I'm a cop! I'm the law!

284
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:53,953
-Get off me! What is it with you?
-Hold it!

285
00:17:54,955 --> 00:17:56,024
Okay, okay.

286
00:17:56,115 --> 00:17:59,266
At least he didn't tell them
about the nail-gun incident.

287
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:03,353
I forgot. Did you have a permit
when you built over the garage?

288
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:04,550
Permit?

289
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:07,069
Hold it! Leo's here. I'll take care of it.

290
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:10,147
I'll make some calls.
We'll get some back-dated permits.

291
00:18:10,235 --> 00:18:12,544
-Which phone can I use?
-Sunroom.

292
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,834
-It must be easier than this.
-Count on Leo Getz.

293
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:21,032
You need less aggravation.
Come to work with me.

294
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:23,471
Thank you, Leo! Son of a bitch!

295
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:27,463
Stop fronting yourself. You know?
Swing with me and my crew.

296
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:34,034
Forget school.

297
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,672
Here comes your pops.

298
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:41,347
-Later.
-All right, gotcha.

299
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:43,954
Next time.

300
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:49,345
-'Morning, Rog.
-How're you doing?

301
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:52,503
Hey, Nick.

302
00:18:53,475 --> 00:18:55,147
-Wasn't that Darryl?
-Yeah.

303
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:57,825
I haven't seen him around in a while.

304
00:18:58,355 --> 00:18:59,504
He dropped out of high school.

305
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:01,825
Those are pretty gang colors he's wearing.

306
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:03,189
Yeah, I know.

307
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:05,704
Hey, Nick?

308
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:07,670
Yeah, Dad?

309
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:09,029
Be good.

310
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:10,551
Word.

311
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,389
"Word", Nick.

312
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:15,950
Word.

313
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:20,150
"Word", Riggs.

314
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:21,509
"Word", Rog.

315
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,994
-What are we talking about?
-"Word".

316
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:26,543
Four letters. Starts with a "W",
"O" in the middle, "D" at the end.

317
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:28,387
Oh, yeah, that word.

318
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:30,425
"Word".

319
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:46,433
-Tyrone, my man, how are you?
-Jack, how's it going?

320
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:48,631
-Let's take a walk.
-Wait here for me.

321
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:51,388
Look around. This is my dream
and it's all coming true.

322
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:55,593
You sank your money into this,
out here in the middle of the desert?

323
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:58,430
-Know why it'll be a gold mine?
-Do tell.

324
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:02,184
Because no one wants to live
next door to a menace like you.

325
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:05,347
I came to do business,
not to be insulted by you.

326
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:06,994
Relax, Tyrone.

327
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:09,391
Like houses, friendships need
strong foundations.

328
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,705
Smitty, come here. Come here.

329
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,866
What's wrong with you?
Don't I pay you good and take care of you?

330
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:21,106
-Sure you do.
-What about the stunt you and Billy pulled?

331
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:22,704
It was a good plan. It worked.

332
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:24,865
It worked? It didn't work.

333
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:26,667
You got nailed, first time out.

334
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:29,064
Nobody who works for me
goes into business for themselves.

335
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:30,508
Do you understand me?

336
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:32,904
See how that can jeopardize everything?
Right?

337
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:34,189
Whatever.

338
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:37,064
Especially trying to pop an armored car.

339
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:40,865
Okay, Billy got caught.
There's nothing I can do about that now.

340
00:20:40,995 --> 00:20:43,555
He'll have to face the music on his own.

341
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,233
But you and me...

342
00:20:45,515 --> 00:20:46,868
...we're gonna start over.

343
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,434
You know what I mean?

344
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,392
-Whatever you say.
-Good.

345
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:53,949
Glad you understand
what I'm talking about.

346
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:02,395
Now we've got a relationship
we can build on.

347
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:07,312
-Employee problems. You know how it is?
-Yeah, right.

348
00:21:07,635 --> 00:21:10,149
You invest time and energy
into training somebody.

349
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:13,625
Then, they get greedy and do something
stupid that jeopardizes everything.

350
00:21:13,715 --> 00:21:14,989
It's a bitch!

351
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:17,390
Stick around. This is the good part.

352
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:19,864
We can put our initials in there.

353
00:21:20,795 --> 00:21:22,148
Jesus Christ!

354
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:28,155
Lankershim and Vineland.
Where are we going?

355
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:31,745
Right here. Rianne's got a new job.
I promised her I'd stop by.

356
00:21:31,995 --> 00:21:33,587
That's a good reason.

357
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:36,351
All right. Here we are.

358
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,429
-You got any silver, any change?
-We're cops.

359
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:49,385
That's right, we're cops. Not crooks.
I'll get change.

360
00:21:58,715 --> 00:22:00,546
Get down! All of you!

361
00:22:04,435 --> 00:22:05,709
Get down!

362
00:22:21,955 --> 00:22:22,990
How do you like that?

363
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,430
What are you doing with a rubber gun?

364
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:26,823
This is a film!

365
00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:29,907
Cut, cut, cut! Who the fuck is this lunatic?

366
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,026
-Get him off my set.
-This isn't part of the story.

367
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:33,753
Can we get a cop?

368
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:39,306
Rianne, I'm so sorry.
I feel like a microbe right now.

369
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:42,194
-You really thought I was in trouble?
-I did.

370
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:45,028
A real cop! Go sit in your fucking trailer!

371
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:47,424
-Are you a fucking idiot?
-I apologize.

372
00:22:47,835 --> 00:22:50,668
He's a friend of mine, a policeman.
He thought I was in trouble.

373
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:51,631
We're both...

374
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:53,068
He's a friend of yours?

375
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:56,431
Let me tell you something: You're fired.
Have a nice day.

376
00:22:56,715 --> 00:22:58,706
Fired? Riggs, what'd you do?

377
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:00,549
You're not fired.

378
00:23:00,635 --> 00:23:02,910
No, you're not. Just take it easy.

379
00:23:02,995 --> 00:23:05,145
You can't fire her for something I did.

380
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:07,385
I don't care whose mistake it was!
She's fired!

381
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:08,908
I apologize to everyone.

382
00:23:08,995 --> 00:23:10,144
Don't push him!

383
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:11,463
All of you, go!

384
00:23:11,595 --> 00:23:13,426
Just take it easy. Don't push him.

385
00:23:13,515 --> 00:23:16,154
Get off my set, all right?
What are you, deaf?

386
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,114
Get off my set!

387
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:20,186
On any normal day,
I'd smack you in the mouth.

388
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,230
Is that so?

389
00:23:21,315 --> 00:23:22,111
Don't!

390
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:23,867
It's a normal day.

391
00:23:24,115 --> 00:23:26,868
I'm sorry. Listen, are you okay? I'm sorry.

392
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:29,992
I'm all thumbs! He fell down!
Let me help you.

393
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,947
I said, don't hit him!

394
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,627
-Is she fired?
-Yes, she's fired!

395
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:35,387
-Is she fired?
-No, no.

396
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:36,669
-It's okay.
-Does she get a raise?

397
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:38,473
-Yes! I said, "yes"!
-Good.

398
00:23:39,315 --> 00:23:41,829
Rianne, I think you have a new friend here.

399
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:44,912
We'd like you to come back.

400
00:23:49,435 --> 00:23:51,471
You can't settle every problem
with your fists.

401
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,672
-I couldn't use my gun with that crowd.
-Six more days.

402
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:56,473
Look, I don't want to hear that.

403
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:59,274
Did Rianne get her job back?
Did she get a raise?

404
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,107
I don't hear a "thank you".

405
00:24:01,395 --> 00:24:04,705
Maybe I should become a Hollywood agent.
What do you think?

406
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:07,267
-It won't work.
-Why?

407
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:09,431
You don't have that killer instinct.

408
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:11,028
Son of a bitch!

409
00:24:11,595 --> 00:24:15,634
-We should've put a bag on the meter.
-I'll put it in the glove compartment.

410
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:17,074
I don't do that anymore.

411
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,713
Oh, yeah? Good man.

412
00:24:18,795 --> 00:24:20,945
It's full. Put it in the back seat.

413
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:27,832
-You really like those things?
-These? They're good.

414
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:33,671
You can eat a box of them
and still be dying for a cigarette.

415
00:24:36,795 --> 00:24:39,070
-Did you cut yourself shaving?
-Yeah.

416
00:24:39,835 --> 00:24:41,109
Old razor?

417
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:42,864
Old face.

418
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:47,833
You're letting this retirement thing
get you down.

419
00:24:48,675 --> 00:24:51,508
Spend a few more years
to get used to the idea. Why quit?

420
00:24:51,595 --> 00:24:54,393
-I've got plans for my retirement.
-Oh, yeah, plans.

421
00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:55,988
-I do. Big plans.
-Big plans?

422
00:24:56,075 --> 00:24:58,031
-I've had them for a long time.
-Like what?

423
00:24:58,115 --> 00:24:59,343
Like....

424
00:25:01,075 --> 00:25:02,872
-Things, man!
-Things!

425
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:04,470
Things!

426
00:25:04,555 --> 00:25:06,034
Things that I've put off.

427
00:25:06,115 --> 00:25:08,709
Oh, those things. I've got those, too.

428
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:11,709
I see you've given this a lot of thought.

429
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:15,430
Yeah.

430
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:18,151
I've given it a lot of thought.

431
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:37,909
Goddamn it!

432
00:25:38,315 --> 00:25:41,387
-What's going on?
-I'm pissed off. You need a reason?

433
00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:45,263
-I thought I heard gunfire.
-Get your hearing checked! Put that away!

434
00:25:45,435 --> 00:25:46,663
What're you looking at?

435
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:48,313
Hey, man. Peace.

436
00:26:09,675 --> 00:26:11,745
Why'd you call us down here?

437
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,389
How're you doing, son?

438
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:17,705
Does your mother know you're here?

439
00:26:21,035 --> 00:26:23,071
-Did you do this?
-Nice shooting.

440
00:26:23,235 --> 00:26:25,112
Better than Billy the Kid.

441
00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:27,272
Diaper rash makes you cranky.

442
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:30,546
Give it to your mom.
Maybe she'll stick it on the refrigerator.

443
00:26:30,635 --> 00:26:32,705
-Can I borrow your glasses?
-Yeah.

444
00:26:32,915 --> 00:26:34,109
Who's wearing?

445
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:35,714
Roger, you are.

446
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:37,672
Why me? You guys should be wearing.

447
00:26:37,755 --> 00:26:39,791
Mr. Murtaugh, let me assist you.

448
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:42,150
I don't need help.
I've been dressing myself since I was 30.

449
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:44,510
-Okay, man, just trying to help.
-Get back.

450
00:26:44,595 --> 00:26:46,187
All you perverts, turn your heads.

451
00:26:46,275 --> 00:26:48,470
-Take it off, baby!
-Hold this shirt.

452
00:26:49,995 --> 00:26:51,633
You're wearing a girdle!

453
00:26:51,915 --> 00:26:54,065
-He's got a girdle!
-This is not a girdle.

454
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,986
This is not a girdle. It's my back!

455
00:26:56,075 --> 00:26:57,747
My back went out on me.

456
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:02,754
I hurt my back this morning lifting weights.
What're you talking about?

457
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,228
I saw him do it.

458
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:05,350
Everybody, listen up.

459
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:08,472
I want you all to look at
these...lovely bullets.

460
00:27:08,635 --> 00:27:09,351
Cute.

461
00:27:09,435 --> 00:27:12,825
Notice the smooth jacket.
Pay particular attention to the tip.

462
00:27:17,355 --> 00:27:20,552
Now you've all seen these vests
stop a .357 magnum bullet.

463
00:27:20,795 --> 00:27:22,194
-Yeah.
-Okay.

464
00:27:24,995 --> 00:27:26,223
Observe.

465
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:41,829
Son of a bitch!

466
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,634
-Armor-piercing bullets?
-Yeah, cop killers.

467
00:27:47,995 --> 00:27:51,465
Those bullets came from the gun
of a suspect we arrested yesterday.

468
00:27:51,555 --> 00:27:53,671
They're out there on the streets.

469
00:27:53,795 --> 00:27:56,867
Vests are optional, boys and girls.
Especially boys.

470
00:27:57,235 --> 00:27:58,509
See you, Riggs.

471
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:02,309
Cop killers.

472
00:28:04,395 --> 00:28:05,828
Son of a bitch.

473
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:12,952
I think we should talk to Billy Phelps.
I'll have him brought in for interrogation.

474
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:23,424
I'm here to talk to Billy Phelps.

475
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,830
-Can I see your ID, please?
-Sure.

476
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:29,831
William Phelps, armored car suspect.
He's been moved to lnterrogation.

477
00:28:29,915 --> 00:28:33,112
-Do you know where that is?
-Sure. I've been there a lot.

478
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:43,228
Same floor.

479
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:49,950
I guess now you're retiring, that Swiss
bank account will come in pretty handy.

480
00:28:50,315 --> 00:28:52,954
How much you got in there, a million?
Million and a half?

481
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:54,184
-Five.
-Five?

482
00:28:55,155 --> 00:28:56,907
Well, you deserve it.

483
00:28:57,075 --> 00:29:00,226
It's better than those
miserable drug dealers getting it.

484
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:05,553
What're you talking about?

485
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:09,504
Don't sweat it. You laundered it,
didn't you? They can't trace it.

486
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:11,587
-They can't trace it.
-What?

487
00:29:11,715 --> 00:29:14,912
So long as I get an invite
to Casa de Murtaugh, I'm happy.

488
00:29:14,995 --> 00:29:16,189
Casa what?

489
00:29:16,315 --> 00:29:18,271
-I've never been to Portugal.
-Stop joking.

490
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:19,470
She's a cop!

491
00:29:19,555 --> 00:29:22,592
I know she's a cop.
She's probably on the take, too.

492
00:29:23,715 --> 00:29:25,353
The whole Force is bent.

493
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:28,064
She may be wearing a skirt,
but we're all brothers.

494
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:31,147
You know I have nothing.
I ain't been to Portugal.

495
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:33,268
Listen to me.

496
00:29:36,715 --> 00:29:38,228
Son of a bitch.

497
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,066
-How're you doing?
-Fine.

498
00:29:41,235 --> 00:29:43,146
-Who is it today?
-Billy Phelps.

499
00:29:44,675 --> 00:29:45,710
Who're you?

500
00:29:45,795 --> 00:29:48,434
Fly me. I'm your friendly
Portuguese airline.

501
00:29:49,115 --> 00:29:50,514
She's lnfernal Affairs.

502
00:29:50,595 --> 00:29:51,550
How'd you know?

503
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:54,433
I took the liberty
of looking at your file folder.

504
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:56,424
Lorna Cole.

505
00:29:57,315 --> 00:30:00,068
-And you're Sergeant Murtaugh.
-I used to be.

506
00:30:00,235 --> 00:30:02,988
What's lnfernal Repairs
want with our collar?

507
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:04,947
We're taking over, thanks.

508
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:06,753
Nobody told us they were taking over.

509
00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:08,712
Nobody has to tell you anything,
Patrolman.

510
00:30:08,795 --> 00:30:10,148
I want to go and see the captain.

511
00:30:10,235 --> 00:30:12,954
You want to see the captain?
Let's go see the captain.

512
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:15,993
-And put on a vest.
-Oh, are you wearing one?

513
00:30:16,155 --> 00:30:18,066
Just take it easy, man.

514
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:33,067
Hey, guys. Phelps, William.
Actually, his name's Billy.

515
00:30:33,315 --> 00:30:34,509
You, too?

516
00:30:34,675 --> 00:30:36,666
-Popular guy today.
-Somebody with him?

517
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:39,633
No, not really.
He's down the hall to the right.

518
00:30:39,795 --> 00:30:41,706
Want to sign in here, Sarge?

519
00:30:42,315 --> 00:30:43,430
Miss.

520
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:47,830
-What's lnternal Affairs doing here?
-Don't start. I just found out myself.

521
00:30:47,915 --> 00:30:49,951
This is Herman Walters,
Chief of lntelligence.

522
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:52,026
You haven't met his daughter,
Lorna Doone.

523
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:53,628
Pleased to meet you.

524
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:56,428
The Phelps case has been transferred
to lnternal Affairs.

525
00:30:56,515 --> 00:30:57,345
Why?

526
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:59,391
-I can't tell you.
-That's classified.

527
00:30:59,475 --> 00:31:01,989
We busted our buns busting this guy.
We busted him.

528
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:04,191
Busted is right.
He spent the night in the hospital.

529
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:06,311
-He didn't buckle up.
-We even cited him.

530
00:31:06,395 --> 00:31:08,226
I know, I read your report.

531
00:31:08,795 --> 00:31:11,229
Our cases have, unfortunately,
crossed paths here.

532
00:31:11,315 --> 00:31:13,670
That's all I can say.
We'll take over from here.

533
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:15,985
Captain, what is she talking about here?

534
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:18,669
-That's classified.
-No, I'm talking to him.

535
00:31:18,755 --> 00:31:20,154
I'm telling you...

536
00:31:20,235 --> 00:31:22,590
No, I said, "Captain".
I'm talking to the captain.

537
00:31:22,675 --> 00:31:25,348
-That's classified!
-I'm talking to him!

538
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:27,034
That's bullshit!

539
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:31,795
Maybe these guys can contribute
something to this case?

540
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:35,072
From their records,
they only contribute mayhem and chaos.

541
00:31:35,235 --> 00:31:37,465
No, I'm Chaos, he's Mayhem.
We're a double act.

542
00:31:37,555 --> 00:31:39,386
What are we,
required reading or something?

543
00:31:39,475 --> 00:31:40,874
As a matter of fact, you are.

544
00:31:40,955 --> 00:31:43,947
It's a cross between Police Gazette
and Mad magazine.

545
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,868
-What's wrong with Mad?
-Nothing, I used to read it...

546
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:48,468
You've got some taste.

547
00:31:48,555 --> 00:31:49,874
...when I was 12.

548
00:31:50,995 --> 00:31:52,508
Riggs, let's go.

549
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:54,506
We busted him, we can talk to him.

550
00:31:54,595 --> 00:31:56,665
-Captain.
-Riggs. Murtaugh.

551
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,906
Get your asses back here.

552
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:03,627
You'll be needing these.

553
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,266
I'm reinstating both of you.

554
00:32:06,755 --> 00:32:08,746
-Don't you just love him?
-Yeah.

555
00:32:09,315 --> 00:32:10,350
God!

556
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:13,868
You really are a beautiful man.

557
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:15,547
Just get rid of the blues.

558
00:32:15,635 --> 00:32:18,513
-They don't go with your ponytail.
-Absolutely not.

559
00:32:19,995 --> 00:32:21,144
Yeah, right.

560
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:22,310
Get a haircut!

561
00:32:22,395 --> 00:32:23,794
Of course, I won't.

562
00:32:23,995 --> 00:32:25,633
You've exceeded your authority, Captain.

563
00:32:25,715 --> 00:32:28,309
-That's not how I see it.
-That's how the chief will see it.

564
00:32:28,395 --> 00:32:30,272
-Take it up with him.
-I think I will.

565
00:32:30,355 --> 00:32:33,950
Catch up with them. We don't want this
screwed up with cowboy tactics.

566
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,229
Son of a bitch.

567
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,590
Hi, Billy.

568
00:32:41,555 --> 00:32:42,510
Jack!

569
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:43,710
Bye, Billy.

570
00:32:50,995 --> 00:32:52,508
See you, Billy.

571
00:32:58,995 --> 00:33:00,872
Sergeant, did you get what you need?

572
00:33:00,955 --> 00:33:03,469
Not really. It's a dead issue, I'm afraid.

573
00:33:05,035 --> 00:33:07,071
How long has Phelps been doing this?

574
00:33:07,155 --> 00:33:09,669
-Doing what?
-This armored-car thing.

575
00:33:10,035 --> 00:33:12,947
I wouldn't know.
I'm not interested in armored cars.

576
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:28,030
I don't think she's telling us everything.

577
00:33:28,115 --> 00:33:29,343
I think you're right.

578
00:33:29,435 --> 00:33:31,995
Boy, these six days are going to be rough.

579
00:33:32,075 --> 00:33:33,793
God, be good to me.

580
00:33:36,035 --> 00:33:39,550
Shit, son of a bitch knew there was
a camera in the wall.

581
00:33:40,315 --> 00:33:40,952
Damn it!

582
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:43,595
He didn't know there was one
in the interrogation room.

583
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:45,074
There isn't.

584
00:33:46,035 --> 00:33:47,354
We installed them six months ago.

585
00:33:47,435 --> 00:33:49,107
-Every station.
-That's great.

586
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:51,755
Six months and we don't know about it?

587
00:33:51,835 --> 00:33:53,427
This is the "police police", Captain.

588
00:33:53,515 --> 00:33:56,871
"Police police". Very good. Can you say
that three times in a row, real fast?

589
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:59,264
-Why? Am I getting to you?
-Are you trying to bait me?

590
00:33:59,355 --> 00:34:00,708
I'm a master at it.

591
00:34:00,795 --> 00:34:01,989
That figures.

592
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:04,669
Baiting master. Great, man,
try all the tricks.

593
00:34:04,755 --> 00:34:06,393
Freeze that. Stop it.

594
00:34:06,515 --> 00:34:07,868
Jack Travis.

595
00:34:08,075 --> 00:34:08,951
Who?

596
00:34:09,075 --> 00:34:11,305
Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.

597
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:13,634
He was one of us.

598
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:16,434
Hell of a brutal cop.
He could beat a confession out of anyone.

599
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:17,789
A dirty cop.

600
00:34:17,915 --> 00:34:21,544
I've never seen so many suspensions
and reprimands and charges of misconduct.

601
00:34:21,635 --> 00:34:23,865
He's also as tough as they come.

602
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,623
What happened to him?

603
00:34:25,715 --> 00:34:26,830
I don't know.

604
00:34:26,915 --> 00:34:30,510
His partner and him were on a stakeout.
He went for coffee, never came back.

605
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:33,063
Looks like he's had
one cappuccino too many.

606
00:34:33,235 --> 00:34:34,953
We'd better brief Walters.

607
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:37,146
Excuse me, cute stuff.

608
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:40,115
-That's harassment.
-Cute stuff. That's you.

609
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:43,548
-Captain.
-Boys, boys. Just the captain.

610
00:34:44,275 --> 00:34:47,631
Your involvement in this case ended
when Phelps hit the floor.

611
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:50,514
Why don't you just go back
and beat your street?

612
00:34:50,995 --> 00:34:53,304
-Now's the time to buy.
-Not now.

613
00:34:53,955 --> 00:34:55,946
-Hey, Roger, Roger!
-Not now, Leo!

614
00:34:56,035 --> 00:34:58,595
-Not now!
-We got to talk, babe, okay?

615
00:34:58,675 --> 00:35:00,506
You're in trouble. You've got termites.

616
00:35:00,595 --> 00:35:01,789
Termites?

617
00:35:02,115 --> 00:35:04,151
-Oh, God!
-You're infested!

618
00:35:04,915 --> 00:35:06,553
The only thing holding up your house
is the paint.

619
00:35:06,635 --> 00:35:07,704
We should go.

620
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:09,945
Leo, could you get the place fumigated?

621
00:35:10,035 --> 00:35:12,344
We should pull every file on this guy.

622
00:35:12,435 --> 00:35:14,744
I know this guy.
Are you watching Geraldo?

623
00:35:14,835 --> 00:35:15,984
-What?
-I know the guy.

624
00:35:16,075 --> 00:35:18,714
-How do you know him?
-I've seen the guy before.

625
00:35:18,795 --> 00:35:20,990
-Where?
-I don't know. I recognize him...

626
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:23,669
His name is Jack Travis.
Does that ring a bell?

627
00:35:24,595 --> 00:35:26,472
Hands off the clothes. Okay?

628
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:28,666
I'm thinking. Let me think.

629
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:30,908
It was a big party.

630
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:34,112
Someone brought a monkey
that knocked over the salad bar.

631
00:35:34,275 --> 00:35:37,392
And this guy comes in
and introduces me to another guy...

632
00:35:37,555 --> 00:35:39,307
...who wants a favor.

633
00:35:39,795 --> 00:35:41,467
-I got it! I got it!
-What?

634
00:35:41,675 --> 00:35:42,710
He's got it!

635
00:35:42,835 --> 00:35:44,553
-I remember!
-You remember!

636
00:35:44,915 --> 00:35:47,509
Don't do it. Don't let the earring fool you.

637
00:35:48,035 --> 00:35:50,230
-We're back. We're back!
-Yeah. Yeah.

638
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,350
Listen, listen.

639
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:52,993
Can I have a gun this time?

640
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:54,110
No!

641
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:07,507
Okay, this is it! These guys always
wanted me to do favors for them!

642
00:36:08,155 --> 00:36:11,750
Like, some guys wanted broads,
another guy wanted Cuban cigars.

643
00:36:11,915 --> 00:36:13,553
Your guy, hockey!

644
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,552
The best seats in the house!

645
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,906
-Where're the seats?
-Yeah?

646
00:36:20,995 --> 00:36:22,826
Probably by the glass.

647
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:25,984
Does "needle in a haystack"
mean anything to you?

648
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:27,508
Why don't we spread out?

649
00:36:27,595 --> 00:36:31,349
If we all take a different direction,
it'd be like old times.

650
00:36:32,115 --> 00:36:34,913
Don't push, lady!
I'm on police business here!

651
00:36:34,995 --> 00:36:36,667
Just take it easy!

652
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,785
Los Angeles penalty. Number 15.

653
00:37:06,795 --> 00:37:08,626
Two minutes for high-sticking.

654
00:37:08,715 --> 00:37:10,068
Time, 5:15.

655
00:37:28,755 --> 00:37:30,347
Mr. Jack Travis?

656
00:37:31,635 --> 00:37:34,069
Mr. Jack Travis, this is the LAPD.

657
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:39,106
We know you're in here. We know
where you are. Just stay in your seat.

658
00:37:39,195 --> 00:37:40,674
Don't be stupid.

659
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:43,470
I'll be there to escort you out in a minute.

660
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:46,706
There's a policeman at every exit,
so it's no use trying to run.

661
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:48,911
-Smart son of a bitch.
-Just stay where you are.

662
00:37:48,995 --> 00:37:51,463
Thanks for your cooperation.
Play on, boys.

663
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:07,147
Come on, let's go!

664
00:38:16,675 --> 00:38:18,472
Get out of my fucking way!

665
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:31,390
Excuse me.

666
00:38:43,715 --> 00:38:45,353
You can't be on the ice!

667
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:53,428
I got him! I got him!

668
00:38:55,795 --> 00:38:58,628
You have the right.... You're under arrest!

669
00:39:07,035 --> 00:39:08,104
Fucking weasel!

670
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:10,026
What the hell's going on here?

671
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:11,628
I'm LAPD! LAPD!

672
00:39:11,835 --> 00:39:14,110
I don't care! You can't be on the ice!

673
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:21,270
I got him!

674
00:39:21,555 --> 00:39:23,625
You're all right, pal. Stay calm.

675
00:39:26,275 --> 00:39:27,628
Make sure you tell my mother!

676
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:28,989
Where'd he go?

677
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,224
Down there!

678
00:39:40,235 --> 00:39:41,873
Son of a...bitch!

679
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,509
He thinks I don't know I'm dying.
I know it.

680
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:50,385
-You'll be okay.
-I'm dying, Roger.

681
00:39:51,395 --> 00:39:52,874
I'm choking, see?

682
00:39:53,195 --> 00:39:55,186
This is what they do when they die.

683
00:39:55,275 --> 00:39:57,106
Leo, it's going to be okay.

684
00:39:58,635 --> 00:40:00,751
My body's numb! I can't feel it!

685
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:03,503
I'm going to die, I know it! What?

686
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:05,587
You're lying on the ice.

687
00:40:07,435 --> 00:40:09,903
-That's why I'm cold?
-That's why you're cold.

688
00:40:09,995 --> 00:40:12,304
-That's why I'm numb?
-That's why you're numb.

689
00:40:12,395 --> 00:40:14,113
But he shot me. Look at all the blood.

690
00:40:14,195 --> 00:40:16,755
-It's just a flesh wound.
-So it's okay.

691
00:40:21,835 --> 00:40:25,271
He's okay, he's okay!
He's going to make it! He's alive!

692
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:33,308
-Bring him this way.
-I can't believe this.

693
00:40:34,995 --> 00:40:37,031
-I can't believe I got shot.
-Calm down.

694
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:38,309
Riggs, are you here?

695
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:41,034
We're all the same now. We all got shot.

696
00:40:41,195 --> 00:40:42,514
You'll be fine.

697
00:40:43,035 --> 00:40:43,945
Relax.

698
00:40:44,115 --> 00:40:47,312
I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me.
I can take this.

699
00:40:47,475 --> 00:40:48,954
Just calm down. We'll take care of it.

700
00:40:49,035 --> 00:40:51,071
You'll be out of here tonight.
It's no big deal.

701
00:40:51,155 --> 00:40:53,589
This isn't a good idea.
You shouldn't rush this, Doc.

702
00:40:53,675 --> 00:40:55,028
You should rest up.

703
00:40:55,115 --> 00:40:57,026
A dum-dum wound can be serious.

704
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,827
What's a "dum-dum wound"?

705
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:02,989
You don't know? A guy on the Force
got his thumb shot off by a dum-dum.

706
00:41:03,075 --> 00:41:05,270
From the shock,
he was dead two days later.

707
00:41:05,355 --> 00:41:06,788
Dead two days later?

708
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:08,354
He died from dum-dums?

709
00:41:08,435 --> 00:41:10,790
-We'll keep you overnight.
-Make it two.

710
00:41:10,955 --> 00:41:11,910
Two days?

711
00:41:11,995 --> 00:41:13,826
Okay, we'll keep him two days.

712
00:41:13,915 --> 00:41:15,507
Is that Leo's chart?

713
00:41:15,635 --> 00:41:18,786
-Two days, then you'll be as good as new.
-I should be with them.

714
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,274
I should be with...

715
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,987
How do you spell, "proctological"?

716
00:41:23,075 --> 00:41:24,474
Rectal exam?

717
00:41:25,035 --> 00:41:27,833
-No, you can't do that to Leo.
-Sure, we can.

718
00:41:27,915 --> 00:41:28,711
Why's she...

719
00:41:28,795 --> 00:41:30,148
Please, Mr. Getz.

720
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:33,787
You've been shot in the arm?
Let her take it. You'll get it back.

721
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,786
There's a clock in your room.

722
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:39,546
Does this look like a "dum-dum wound"?

723
00:41:39,635 --> 00:41:42,069
-It sounded like one when it happened.
-Shit.

724
00:41:42,155 --> 00:41:45,784
-Take it easy. Two days.
-Two days and you'll be out. No problem.

725
00:41:46,115 --> 00:41:49,187
-I'll see you guys.
-We won't make a move without you.

726
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:50,867
I thought that bullet sounded different.

727
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:53,788
-Relax. They'll be there when you get out.
-I'm fine.

728
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:55,831
-You own your house, Doc?
-What?

729
00:41:55,915 --> 00:41:57,746
-You don't recognize my face?
-No, sir.

730
00:41:57,835 --> 00:41:58,711
Watch.

731
00:41:59,555 --> 00:42:03,150
It's about time. These doggy treats
are okay, but I need some human food.

732
00:42:03,235 --> 00:42:06,705
Don't worry. I'll make you the best thing
you've ever had.

733
00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:08,150
Good.

734
00:42:09,555 --> 00:42:12,865
-You ever eat one of my hamburgers?
-I've been lucky so far.

735
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:15,154
Fast Eddie!

736
00:42:15,595 --> 00:42:17,347
-How's business?
-Booming. Can't you tell?

737
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:19,824
Yeah, I'm looking at it.
Did you meet my partner?

738
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:22,588
I want to cook one
of those monster burgers for him.

739
00:42:22,675 --> 00:42:24,028
-Go for it.
-All right.

740
00:42:24,115 --> 00:42:26,106
-You'll let him cook?
-Do I have a choice?

741
00:42:26,195 --> 00:42:28,265
No, because it's Wednesday.

742
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:30,068
He's too big to argue with.

743
00:42:30,155 --> 00:42:32,066
In that case, give me a MacRog.

744
00:42:32,195 --> 00:42:33,514
Hold the hair.

745
00:42:34,195 --> 00:42:35,344
Did you wash your hands?

746
00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:38,825
Keep joking. But I guarantee
you're gonna like this burger...

747
00:42:39,035 --> 00:42:42,152
...and you're gonna come back
with your friends.

748
00:42:42,955 --> 00:42:46,106
I haven't got any friends,
you know that, except you.

749
00:42:46,475 --> 00:42:48,750
He's a comedian in his spare time.

750
00:42:49,195 --> 00:42:51,265
When is he gonna say something funny?

751
00:42:51,355 --> 00:42:52,993
Are you gonna put that out?

752
00:42:53,075 --> 00:42:54,554
You're finished with it, yeah?

753
00:42:54,635 --> 00:42:56,273
Do you mind? Thanks.

754
00:42:58,315 --> 00:43:00,465
Sorry. I was just looking at it.

755
00:43:00,555 --> 00:43:02,193
Chew on this onion.

756
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:05,192
He's quitting, so help him.

757
00:43:05,995 --> 00:43:07,633
I was only looking at it.

758
00:43:10,475 --> 00:43:12,113
The first thing is the fat.

759
00:43:12,195 --> 00:43:14,186
Everyone says, "Cut the fat".

760
00:43:14,755 --> 00:43:17,827
My uncle said, "You cut the fat,
you kill the burger". Right?

761
00:43:17,915 --> 00:43:18,552
Yeah.

762
00:43:18,635 --> 00:43:21,945
There's an art to it.
You just can't plop this on the grill.

763
00:43:24,195 --> 00:43:26,345
Gently coax the flavors out.

764
00:43:28,675 --> 00:43:30,506
Yo, hey, what's the problem?

765
00:43:37,035 --> 00:43:40,186
A little pepper,
then you massage it a little bit.

766
00:43:40,595 --> 00:43:41,823
Just a little bit.

767
00:43:41,915 --> 00:43:43,633
"Sweet, sweet meat"

768
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:48,553
Shit, man, feel it.

769
00:43:52,115 --> 00:43:53,230
Okay, guys!

770
00:43:53,555 --> 00:43:55,307
LAPD. Let me see your hands.

771
00:43:55,395 --> 00:43:57,670
Let me see your hands! Get them up!

772
00:43:57,755 --> 00:44:01,304
In the car! Get them up there!
Let me see both of them! Come on!

773
00:44:05,115 --> 00:44:06,184
Hey, Riggs!

774
00:44:14,555 --> 00:44:15,431
Riggs!

775
00:44:16,795 --> 00:44:19,070
Don't you love me? For five days!

776
00:44:26,755 --> 00:44:28,188
Don't do that to me!

777
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:30,106
-Riggs, are you okay?
-Yeah.

778
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:31,463
Who did it?

779
00:44:33,795 --> 00:44:35,148
All right, asshole!

780
00:44:35,235 --> 00:44:37,385
I want to see your hands, right now!

781
00:45:02,595 --> 00:45:03,948
Back me up, Riggs!

782
00:45:28,595 --> 00:45:29,789
Darryl?

783
00:45:35,715 --> 00:45:36,989
Fuck, no!

784
00:45:37,355 --> 00:45:38,390
Fuck, no!

785
00:45:41,595 --> 00:45:44,632
Call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance! Breathe!

786
00:45:45,235 --> 00:45:46,668
Please, breathe!

787
00:45:47,155 --> 00:45:48,349
Breathe!

788
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:50,187
Call an ambulance!

789
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,385
Come on! Breathe! Oh, God!

790
00:45:53,595 --> 00:45:55,108
Fuck, it's Darryl!

791
00:45:57,395 --> 00:45:58,987
Oh, God, don't do this to me! Breathe!

792
00:45:59,075 --> 00:46:01,305
-He's dead.
-Breathe! Breathe!

793
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:03,785
-God, don't do this!
-He's dead.

794
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:06,106
He's dead! Rog, he's dead!

795
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,023
He's dead, Rog!
Don't mess with the corpse.

796
00:46:09,315 --> 00:46:12,273
He's dead. Come on, man,
it was a clean shoot.

797
00:46:12,515 --> 00:46:14,506
It's okay, it was a clean shoot.

798
00:46:14,595 --> 00:46:16,745
He was gonna do you
and he was gonna do me.

799
00:46:16,835 --> 00:46:18,507
It's okay. Are you okay?

800
00:46:19,115 --> 00:46:20,548
It's not okay.

801
00:46:21,795 --> 00:46:23,228
I know that kid.

802
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:27,149
I know that kid.

803
00:46:28,475 --> 00:46:30,113
He's Nick's friend.

804
00:46:46,995 --> 00:46:48,826
-I got it, Mom.
-I'll get it.

805
00:46:49,435 --> 00:46:50,504
Hello?

806
00:46:50,835 --> 00:46:52,109
Hi, Martin.

807
00:46:52,755 --> 00:46:54,029
He's not here.

808
00:47:01,315 --> 00:47:02,668
Oh, my God!

809
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:07,069
Thanks.

810
00:47:35,715 --> 00:47:36,750
Fuck!

811
00:47:42,475 --> 00:47:44,591
How're you doing? Taking your vitamins?

812
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:47,428
-Riggs, how's Murtaugh?
-He's good. He's fine.

813
00:47:48,195 --> 00:47:51,073
-I'm sure he's anything but fine.
-Really, he's okay.

814
00:47:51,155 --> 00:47:54,545
-I'd really like to talk to him.
-That's not such a good idea.

815
00:47:55,115 --> 00:47:56,992
The best thing to do is to leave him alone.

816
00:47:57,075 --> 00:48:00,704
-Let's get something for your cold.
-I know what I'm talking about.

817
00:48:01,635 --> 00:48:04,547
-We have to talk.
-Talking to you is bad for my image.

818
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:06,671
-I'm afraid I insist.
-Oh, you insist?

819
00:48:06,755 --> 00:48:10,464
In that case, let's find someplace private.
Step into my orifice.

820
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:19,108
-Hey, Becker, how's it hanging?
-Hey, Riggs.

821
00:48:19,235 --> 00:48:22,989
-Clip any wrong wires lately?
-I haven't done that for a couple days.

822
00:48:23,395 --> 00:48:25,431
Next time, wait for the bomb squad.

823
00:48:25,515 --> 00:48:26,664
Yeah, it's our job.

824
00:48:26,755 --> 00:48:29,189
I'll remember that.
We saved a cat, though.

825
00:48:29,315 --> 00:48:30,987
Great. I love cats.

826
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,548
Go ahead, talk. I'm listening.

827
00:48:34,635 --> 00:48:38,787
You purposefully withheld information
concerning a case under my investigation.

828
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,274
Damn right, I did.

829
00:48:40,355 --> 00:48:41,788
Careful, she's lnternal Affairs.

830
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:44,628
You had a tip on Travis.
You should have shared it with me.

831
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:46,228
No, I take that back.

832
00:48:46,315 --> 00:48:48,704
You were required to share it with me.

833
00:48:49,075 --> 00:48:51,543
I was "required" to share it with you?

834
00:48:51,635 --> 00:48:53,466
I don't have to share shit with you.

835
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:56,627
School yard rules: lf you don't scratch
my back, I don't throw you...

836
00:48:56,715 --> 00:49:00,071
-Oh, come on, Riggs. I can't do that!
-Yes, you can!

837
00:49:00,195 --> 00:49:02,425
Why don't you cut out
this classified bullshit!

838
00:49:02,515 --> 00:49:04,790
Right now! It's giving me the shits!

839
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,947
We're cops. You're a cop, I'm a cop.
We're both on the same side, right?

840
00:49:08,035 --> 00:49:09,184
-Right?
-Right!

841
00:49:09,275 --> 00:49:11,914
Good! Why don't we start to act like it.

842
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:15,988
There are kids out there. Babies. No
brains, but they got automatic weapons.

843
00:49:16,075 --> 00:49:19,545
-Yesterday, my partner nailed this kid...
-I know about Murtaugh.

844
00:49:21,675 --> 00:49:23,666
Yeah. And I'm sorry, Riggs.

845
00:49:24,755 --> 00:49:25,665
Yeah.

846
00:49:30,795 --> 00:49:33,229
Why don't you let me in on this?
I can help you.

847
00:49:33,315 --> 00:49:36,273
I really want to help you,
if you'll let me. Let me.

848
00:49:36,555 --> 00:49:38,785
What do you say? Have we got a deal?

849
00:49:42,435 --> 00:49:43,834
Wash your hands...

850
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,391
...and meet me in my office.

851
00:49:49,235 --> 00:49:50,350
Yeah.

852
00:49:50,915 --> 00:49:52,348
I'll be right there.

853
00:49:53,995 --> 00:49:55,474
I'll be right there.

854
00:49:56,075 --> 00:49:57,986
MAC-10, 9 mm, semi-automatic...

855
00:49:58,075 --> 00:50:01,112
...converted to automatic
with 36 rounds in the magazine.

856
00:50:01,195 --> 00:50:02,913
"On a sesame seed bun".

857
00:50:03,115 --> 00:50:04,514
Very illegal.

858
00:50:04,715 --> 00:50:06,512
The gun has a history.
Wanna know about it?

859
00:50:06,595 --> 00:50:07,584
Tell me.

860
00:50:10,595 --> 00:50:13,712
"Killed a convenience store clerk
in LA County, July 1990.

861
00:50:13,795 --> 00:50:17,504
"Used in a drive-by shooting
in San Bernardino County, August 1990.

862
00:50:18,155 --> 00:50:22,433
"Confiscated by a truant officer
of the LA School Board, October 1990".

863
00:50:23,075 --> 00:50:25,543
Scheduled for destruction by LAPD
six weeks ago.

864
00:50:25,635 --> 00:50:27,546
"Scheduled for destruction?"

865
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:29,833
But it never got there.

866
00:50:32,075 --> 00:50:34,987
Instead, it found its way
into the hands of a 15-year-old boy...

867
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:37,384
...who fired it on a police officer,
your partner.

868
00:50:37,475 --> 00:50:38,624
I thought it looked familiar.

869
00:50:38,715 --> 00:50:40,671
That gun and 15,000 others like it...

870
00:50:40,755 --> 00:50:44,304
...were stolen from a police storage facility
before they could be destroyed.

871
00:50:44,395 --> 00:50:46,989
They should be paper clips right now,
or license plates.

872
00:50:47,075 --> 00:50:50,988
Anything but a gun. Here we are
busting our asses on the streets...

873
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:55,154
...getting these weapons out of circulation
and now they're headed back out.

874
00:50:55,235 --> 00:50:59,751
By busting Phelps, you stumbled onto
something the LAPD's tried to keep quiet.

875
00:50:59,995 --> 00:51:03,351
That's why lnternal Affairs is onto this.
They think this is an inside job.

876
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,949
That's right. They knew police procedures.

877
00:51:06,115 --> 00:51:08,310
They knew where the guns were stored
and how to get in.

878
00:51:08,395 --> 00:51:10,784
They even knew the sorting codes
on the containers...

879
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:13,514
...because they took the automatics
and left the junk behind.

880
00:51:13,595 --> 00:51:16,063
-It all pointed to a cop.
-Or an ex-cop.

881
00:51:16,355 --> 00:51:17,185
Right.

882
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:18,390
Travis.

883
00:51:20,955 --> 00:51:23,423
And you let him slip through your fingers.

884
00:51:24,155 --> 00:51:25,986
That's closer than you ever got.

885
00:51:26,075 --> 00:51:27,508
Close, Riggs?

886
00:51:27,675 --> 00:51:30,473
Close is a lingerie shop
without a front window.

887
00:51:33,115 --> 00:51:34,628
Do you want to go for a ride?

888
00:51:34,715 --> 00:51:36,387
Sure, where are we going?

889
00:51:36,795 --> 00:51:38,069
It's a surprise.

890
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:43,944
Oh, I love surprises.

891
00:51:44,955 --> 00:51:46,354
What is this place?

892
00:51:46,475 --> 00:51:48,750
I accessed Billy Phelps' phone records
on my computer.

893
00:51:48,835 --> 00:51:50,951
He made a dozen calls to this address.

894
00:51:51,035 --> 00:51:53,151
That was nice of you
to steal that information.

895
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,146
-Semantics, Riggs.
-"Semantics"?

896
00:51:55,235 --> 00:51:57,146
I'm always up for some antics.

897
00:51:57,835 --> 00:51:59,507
Let's go on three.

898
00:51:59,835 --> 00:52:00,790
One.

899
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:03,025
-On three, or three and then go?
-What?

900
00:52:03,115 --> 00:52:05,106
Never mind. One, two, three.

901
00:52:07,675 --> 00:52:08,869
I've got you.

902
00:52:22,115 --> 00:52:24,470
It looks like Billy's grandmother
owns a big dog.

903
00:52:24,555 --> 00:52:26,432
It's not a dog. It's a horse.

904
00:52:26,515 --> 00:52:28,187
I hate dogs, Riggs.

905
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:30,069
I don't get it.

906
00:52:30,195 --> 00:52:33,505
You don't get what?
It's a dog. It's a fucking dog.

907
00:52:33,755 --> 00:52:38,226
I don't get, "Close, is a lingerie shop
without a front window". I don't get it.

908
00:52:38,315 --> 00:52:39,350
Later.

909
00:52:44,275 --> 00:52:45,628
What're you doing?

910
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:48,594
I can't shoot a dog.
People, okay, but not dogs.

911
00:52:49,035 --> 00:52:51,265
I should try to make friends with him.

912
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:52,709
Make friends?

913
00:52:53,755 --> 00:52:57,191
Now don't run, because he'll only
chase you down and kill you.

914
00:52:59,515 --> 00:53:00,550
Here, boy.

915
00:53:00,955 --> 00:53:01,990
Here, boy.

916
00:53:09,555 --> 00:53:10,146
Shit!

917
00:53:10,235 --> 00:53:11,429
Good boy!

918
00:53:19,315 --> 00:53:20,384
Riggs?

919
00:53:25,355 --> 00:53:26,708
You're crazy.

920
00:53:45,995 --> 00:53:47,314
Want some?

921
00:53:47,595 --> 00:53:48,823
Are you hungry?

922
00:53:50,315 --> 00:53:51,907
You're a hungry boy.

923
00:53:52,035 --> 00:53:54,265
Doesn't anybody feed you? Come on.

924
00:53:57,115 --> 00:53:59,106
Here's more. Leave some for me.

925
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:02,711
Very slowly, as if you're not here,
just walk away.

926
00:54:03,275 --> 00:54:04,310
You want me to go?

927
00:54:04,395 --> 00:54:06,147
Yeah. This is a guy sort of thing.

928
00:54:06,235 --> 00:54:07,748
"Guy sort of thing?"

929
00:54:07,835 --> 00:54:09,109
Are you alone?

930
00:54:17,915 --> 00:54:18,984
Stay, stay.

931
00:54:21,035 --> 00:54:22,627
Come on, let's go.

932
00:54:42,955 --> 00:54:44,229
How many is that?

933
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:47,990
-Fifty-five.
-Fifty-five. All right, we've got eight more.

934
00:54:48,235 --> 00:54:50,305
We'll get these later. Let's go.

935
00:54:53,835 --> 00:54:55,154
Hi, fellas.

936
00:54:55,915 --> 00:54:57,587
What's in all these boxes?

937
00:55:07,515 --> 00:55:11,588
Easy, let's not kill him, yet.
Let's see who he is first, all right?

938
00:55:13,595 --> 00:55:15,392
You have the right to remain silent.

939
00:55:15,475 --> 00:55:16,874
Shut him up!

940
00:55:17,475 --> 00:55:19,386
"Sergeant Martin Riggs".

941
00:55:21,715 --> 00:55:23,433
-Get the truck ready.
-Right.

942
00:55:23,515 --> 00:55:25,073
So, Sergeant Riggs...

943
00:55:25,315 --> 00:55:26,828
...how did you find us?

944
00:55:26,915 --> 00:55:28,507
Freeze! Police!

945
00:55:29,475 --> 00:55:30,874
Another one?

946
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:32,867
We need a new fucking dog.

947
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:34,673
Get your hands up, asshole.

948
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,189
Get them up!

949
00:55:39,675 --> 00:55:40,744
A little bit higher.

950
00:55:40,835 --> 00:55:42,029
That's better.

951
00:55:43,355 --> 00:55:44,629
Very good.

952
00:55:48,475 --> 00:55:49,624
Drop it, miss.

953
00:55:51,835 --> 00:55:52,904
Now, look!

954
00:56:39,675 --> 00:56:41,427
Okay, I'm on! No, I'm not!

955
00:56:41,715 --> 00:56:42,545
Wait!

956
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,228
Wait, wait!

957
00:56:47,555 --> 00:56:48,988
Sergeant Cole!

958
00:56:49,075 --> 00:56:50,713
Get down! Get down!

959
00:56:54,395 --> 00:56:56,465
Get those cases and kill that dog!

960
00:57:07,475 --> 00:57:08,464
Stop!

961
00:57:09,115 --> 00:57:12,869
-The dog. Where'd you learn to fight?
-Catholic school. Forget the dog!

962
00:57:12,955 --> 00:57:14,832
Here, boy! We're waiting for the dog!

963
00:57:14,915 --> 00:57:16,746
Hold it, hold it. Hurry up!

964
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,545
Good dog. Good puppy. Go!

965
00:57:22,115 --> 00:57:23,184
Stop!

966
00:57:23,795 --> 00:57:25,114
-What?
-Guns.

967
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:26,184
-It's full of guns.
-Grab one!

968
00:57:26,275 --> 00:57:28,027
-You grab one!
-Chicken.

969
00:57:28,115 --> 00:57:29,264
Step on it.

970
00:57:33,035 --> 00:57:35,026
Get that crate! Come on!

971
00:57:40,635 --> 00:57:44,913
Hatchett, you said not to worry about
the police, but the cops are all over you!

972
00:57:45,075 --> 00:57:47,589
They got my guns.
They'll come after me, next!

973
00:57:47,675 --> 00:57:49,631
As far as I'm concerned, the deal's off!

974
00:57:49,715 --> 00:57:52,707
Get a grip on yourself, Tyrone.
We have a deal.

975
00:57:52,955 --> 00:57:54,308
Nobody backs out.

976
00:57:54,435 --> 00:57:56,426
You said you had the cops under control.

977
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,506
I see that isn't so. Give me one reason...

978
00:57:58,595 --> 00:58:00,074
...why I should do business with you.

979
00:58:00,155 --> 00:58:01,713
I'll give you a good reason.

980
00:58:01,795 --> 00:58:03,706
Tyrone, this is Travis.

981
00:58:04,035 --> 00:58:08,187
You back out now, and I'll make sure
only your dentist can identify the body.

982
00:58:08,275 --> 00:58:10,664
Is that a good enough reason for you?

983
00:58:12,835 --> 00:58:14,393
But I need ammo!

984
00:58:14,515 --> 00:58:16,551
I'm out of business without ammo!

985
00:58:16,635 --> 00:58:17,863
I need the good stuff.

986
00:58:17,955 --> 00:58:20,185
You'll get the ammo. The good stuff.

987
00:58:21,635 --> 00:58:23,227
"The good stuff". Jesus.

988
00:58:23,315 --> 00:58:24,828
Time to pay another visit to the LAPD.

989
00:58:27,475 --> 00:58:29,272
You look like I feel.

990
00:58:42,195 --> 00:58:44,345
Have you got anything
I can put on my head?

991
00:58:44,435 --> 00:58:45,834
The hat in the closet.

992
00:58:45,915 --> 00:58:49,749
You're all heart. Here I thought
you'd get all tender and maternal.

993
00:58:50,555 --> 00:58:52,625
I was raised with four brothers.

994
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:57,266
We got hurt often, but if no bones were
broken or blood gushed, nobody cared.

995
00:58:57,355 --> 00:58:58,754
Look, blood. See? Blood.

996
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:00,268
It's not gushing.

997
00:59:00,435 --> 00:59:02,266
It was free falling earlier.

998
00:59:02,995 --> 00:59:07,466
Could you bring me a needle and thread?
Some peroxide. I'll patch it up myself.

999
00:59:10,235 --> 00:59:11,748
Don't touch anything.

1000
00:59:11,835 --> 00:59:13,109
I wasn't.

1001
00:59:14,795 --> 00:59:16,387
What's with you?

1002
00:59:32,475 --> 00:59:33,988
What are you doing?

1003
00:59:34,395 --> 00:59:36,625
-I said not to touch anything.
-It came on by itself.

1004
00:59:36,715 --> 00:59:38,865
All by itself. What are you, a wise guy?

1005
00:59:38,955 --> 00:59:40,946
You don't like to share your toys?

1006
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,866
-This isn't a toy.
-What is it?

1007
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:44,786
-This is a weapon.
-A weapon?

1008
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:47,105
Used properly, a very effective weapon.

1009
00:59:47,195 --> 00:59:49,106
What, do you throw it at people?

1010
00:59:49,195 --> 00:59:51,914
You'll give yourself a hernia.
Come here. Sit down.

1011
00:59:51,995 --> 00:59:53,110
Right here.

1012
00:59:53,195 --> 00:59:55,834
-Take a little off the top.
-Right here.

1013
01:00:01,115 --> 01:00:03,424
Do you bring all your interrogations home?

1014
01:00:03,515 --> 01:00:05,745
-What are we talking about?
-It's back here.

1015
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:07,473
-Careful, careful.
-Turn your head.

1016
01:00:07,555 --> 01:00:08,988
-Careful.
-This?

1017
01:00:09,075 --> 01:00:11,589
-This scratch?
-It feels like the Grand Canyon.

1018
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:12,869
Oh, God.

1019
01:00:13,515 --> 01:00:14,709
Hold still.

1020
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:18,150
Oh, God. We haven't even started.

1021
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,628
Be gentle with me.

1022
01:00:21,035 --> 01:00:24,391
I see this isn't virgin territory.
What is this? A knife?

1023
01:00:24,555 --> 01:00:27,433
That's an ax.
Some guy mistook my head for a log.

1024
01:00:27,675 --> 01:00:30,143
-That's a natural mistake.
-What, I have a wooden head?

1025
01:00:30,235 --> 01:00:31,554
-Look at that.
-A knife.

1026
01:00:31,635 --> 01:00:33,353
Knife? That's very nice.

1027
01:00:34,035 --> 01:00:34,990
This is all right.

1028
01:00:35,075 --> 01:00:37,464
That's pavement,
dragged down Crenshaw.

1029
01:00:37,595 --> 01:00:40,393
That's great. Look at that texture.
Look at this.

1030
01:00:40,635 --> 01:00:42,626
Same thing. Third and Highland.

1031
01:00:42,755 --> 01:00:45,474
-Dragged for about half a block.
-That's a good one.

1032
01:00:45,555 --> 01:00:47,750
Feel that texture. Cheese-grater time.

1033
01:00:47,835 --> 01:00:49,666
-Moving truck.
-Moving truck?

1034
01:00:49,955 --> 01:00:50,831
Moving bullet.

1035
01:00:50,915 --> 01:00:53,304
-Moving bullet?
-Here. This is the best.

1036
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:56,789
-It goes all the way through to the back.
-Right through?

1037
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:58,547
You're lucky. Was it a .22?

1038
01:00:58,635 --> 01:00:59,909
It's a .38.

1039
01:01:00,235 --> 01:01:02,988
That's a .38? That's wimpy. This is a .38.

1040
01:01:03,075 --> 01:01:05,589
Yours is bigger than mine?
I don't think so.

1041
01:01:06,035 --> 01:01:07,354
Maybe not, but look.

1042
01:01:07,435 --> 01:01:09,903
A whole family of .44s on the back.

1043
01:01:10,635 --> 01:01:11,750
There they are.

1044
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:12,631
That's impressive.

1045
01:01:12,715 --> 01:01:16,071
One hit my lung. I was breathing
blood bubbles. It was disgusting.

1046
01:01:16,155 --> 01:01:17,383
Blood bubbles. Okay.

1047
01:01:17,475 --> 01:01:18,624
You got one?

1048
01:01:19,515 --> 01:01:21,187
Pump-action. 12-gauge.

1049
01:01:23,275 --> 01:01:25,470
Right down here. Went through.

1050
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:27,234
-That must have hurt.
-Right.

1051
01:01:27,315 --> 01:01:28,270
Not too close.

1052
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:30,346
Riggs, if he were that close, I'd be dead.

1053
01:01:30,435 --> 01:01:32,391
I can beat it. I can beat it.

1054
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:35,471
-I'll take your word for it.
-You gotta see this.

1055
01:01:35,555 --> 01:01:37,068
-I believe you.
-This guy had a knife.

1056
01:01:37,155 --> 01:01:40,943
You'll love it. He stuck it in my leg
and ran it around eight times.

1057
01:01:41,835 --> 01:01:43,905
-I'll take your word for it.
-Look!

1058
01:01:44,035 --> 01:01:45,150
No, I said forget it.

1059
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:46,793
This is a blue-ribbon event.

1060
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:48,069
Forget it.

1061
01:01:49,115 --> 01:01:50,150
You started this.

1062
01:01:50,235 --> 01:01:52,703
-Yeah, I can end it.
-You know what?

1063
01:01:53,275 --> 01:01:54,947
You're a very poor loser.

1064
01:01:55,995 --> 01:01:57,189
I didn't lose.

1065
01:01:57,435 --> 01:01:59,027
-Yes, you did.
-No, I didn't lose.

1066
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:00,707
-You lost.
-I conceded.

1067
01:02:00,795 --> 01:02:03,104
No, I conceded. There's a difference
between losing and conceding.

1068
01:02:03,195 --> 01:02:05,151
You conceded or you're conceited?

1069
01:02:05,235 --> 01:02:07,191
-You think I'm conceited?
-Yeah.

1070
01:02:07,275 --> 01:02:09,345
Tell me you lost. Admit to it.

1071
01:02:09,435 --> 01:02:10,550
I'll get you a Band-Aid.

1072
01:02:10,635 --> 01:02:13,513
-Tell me you lost.
-I said, "don't touch anything".

1073
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:27,594
You're going to smack the shit
out of me, right?

1074
01:02:28,155 --> 01:02:29,986
I can do better than that.

1075
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:49,034
This could be a serious ethical breach here.

1076
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,745
I never made it
with another sergeant before.

1077
01:02:51,835 --> 01:02:53,063
Shut up, Riggs.

1078
01:03:49,675 --> 01:03:51,267
Oh, damn, Riggs.

1079
01:03:53,915 --> 01:03:54,791
What do you want?

1080
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:57,264
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

1081
01:03:57,355 --> 01:03:59,107
Who sent you? Trish?

1082
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:01,512
You're doing pretty well.
Trish didn't send me.

1083
01:04:01,595 --> 01:04:03,870
Rianne came to see me.
She asked me to find you.

1084
01:04:03,955 --> 01:04:05,274
To your place?

1085
01:04:05,355 --> 01:04:06,583
Well, that's where I am.

1086
01:04:06,675 --> 01:04:09,428
-My daughter came to your trailer?
-Yeah.

1087
01:04:10,795 --> 01:04:14,583
-My daughter came to your trailer?
-Come on, she was worried.

1088
01:04:15,115 --> 01:04:16,912
Get off of my boat, Riggs!

1089
01:04:16,995 --> 01:04:18,826
-Come on.
-Get off my boat!

1090
01:04:18,915 --> 01:04:20,348
You're drunk.

1091
01:04:20,475 --> 01:04:22,591
That's something you should know about.

1092
01:04:22,675 --> 01:04:25,314
-This isn't going to do you any good.
-Give me that.

1093
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:26,430
Give me that.

1094
01:04:26,515 --> 01:04:28,392
Roger, please don't do this.

1095
01:04:28,715 --> 01:04:31,548
You got three days until you retire.
This won't do you any good.

1096
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:33,990
You self-righteous bastard! Give it....

1097
01:04:34,395 --> 01:04:36,192
Don't do this, okay? Please?

1098
01:04:36,275 --> 01:04:38,072
Give it to me, damn it.

1099
01:04:38,675 --> 01:04:41,064
What are you going to do now, shoot me?

1100
01:04:42,315 --> 01:04:43,350
There.

1101
01:04:43,435 --> 01:04:45,630
Take your finger out of my bottle.
Give me that gun.

1102
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,433
The bottle's going sailing.

1103
01:04:48,395 --> 01:04:49,874
Son of a bitch!

1104
01:04:54,355 --> 01:04:55,834
Not bad for an old man.

1105
01:04:55,915 --> 01:04:56,825
Are you finished?

1106
01:04:56,915 --> 01:04:59,554
No, I got another bottle in the galley
and I'm gonna get it.

1107
01:04:59,635 --> 01:05:00,863
No, you're not.

1108
01:05:00,955 --> 01:05:02,991
Don't do this to yourself!

1109
01:05:03,075 --> 01:05:04,667
You gotta cut this out.

1110
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:07,945
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1111
01:05:08,435 --> 01:05:10,073
Come on. Sit down.

1112
01:05:11,955 --> 01:05:13,593
-You hit me.
-Cool it, will you?

1113
01:05:13,675 --> 01:05:15,506
Cut it out. Give it up, okay?

1114
01:05:15,595 --> 01:05:16,710
Go ahead.

1115
01:05:16,795 --> 01:05:18,626
Go ahead. Hit me again.

1116
01:05:18,795 --> 01:05:20,911
I don't want to hit you!
You think I like this shit?

1117
01:05:20,995 --> 01:05:23,714
Hit me again. You think I'm afraid of you?

1118
01:05:23,955 --> 01:05:26,344
-I know you're not.
-Of that kung-fu shit?

1119
01:05:26,515 --> 01:05:27,914
Please, Rog.

1120
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:30,831
That kid was a killer, all right.

1121
01:05:30,915 --> 01:05:32,189
That wasn't a toy in his hand.

1122
01:05:32,275 --> 01:05:35,665
That was a machine pistol
with twin carbines and all the trimmings.

1123
01:05:35,755 --> 01:05:36,790
He would have drilled you...

1124
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:39,150
...me, anybody that came along.

1125
01:05:39,315 --> 01:05:40,794
You had no choice.

1126
01:05:41,115 --> 01:05:43,345
It didn't happen to you. It happened to me.

1127
01:05:43,435 --> 01:05:44,834
It happened to me!

1128
01:05:44,915 --> 01:05:46,951
My God, I killed that kid!

1129
01:05:47,155 --> 01:05:48,508
I killed that boy.

1130
01:05:48,595 --> 01:05:50,472
You've killed a lot of people.

1131
01:05:50,635 --> 01:05:53,945
You've killed a fucking lot of people!
You don't kill a baby!

1132
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:57,226
You've got ice in your veins.
You don't kill a boy like Nick.

1133
01:05:57,315 --> 01:05:58,873
You selfish bastard!

1134
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,434
You selfish bastard!

1135
01:06:00,755 --> 01:06:03,030
You're just thinking about yourself.

1136
01:06:03,155 --> 01:06:04,429
What about me?

1137
01:06:05,075 --> 01:06:07,305
We're partners! We are partners.

1138
01:06:08,235 --> 01:06:09,907
What happens to you, happens to me.

1139
01:06:09,995 --> 01:06:13,146
After all the shit we've been through,
don't you get it?

1140
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:14,588
Don't you get it?

1141
01:06:15,435 --> 01:06:18,871
When you retire, you're not just
retiring you, you're retiring us.

1142
01:06:18,955 --> 01:06:20,752
-You're retiring us.
-That's not my problem.

1143
01:06:20,835 --> 01:06:21,824
Yes, it is.

1144
01:06:21,915 --> 01:06:24,668
-It's not my problem!
-You're the only family I've got!

1145
01:06:24,755 --> 01:06:27,349
I've got three beautiful kids.
I love them and they're yours!

1146
01:06:27,435 --> 01:06:30,552
Trish does my laundry.
I live in your icebox. I live in your life!

1147
01:06:30,635 --> 01:06:32,466
What am I going to do?

1148
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:34,154
-I don't care.
-Yes, you do!

1149
01:06:34,235 --> 01:06:35,554
-I don't care.
-Yes, you do!

1150
01:06:35,635 --> 01:06:37,068
I don't care!

1151
01:06:37,155 --> 01:06:38,224
Yes, you do!

1152
01:06:38,315 --> 01:06:40,192
-I don't care!
-You do so!

1153
01:06:40,275 --> 01:06:41,708
I don't care!

1154
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:43,985
I don't care! I don't care!

1155
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:50,344
I don't know what I'm saying anymore.
I don't know what I'm thinking.

1156
01:06:51,115 --> 01:06:53,265
I had three days, and now this.

1157
01:06:54,835 --> 01:06:55,870
I'm sorry.

1158
01:06:56,155 --> 01:06:58,544
-That's all right.
-No, I'm really sorry.

1159
01:07:00,195 --> 01:07:01,548
I didn't realize...

1160
01:07:01,635 --> 01:07:03,626
...that my retirement
was gonna screw you up.

1161
01:07:03,715 --> 01:07:07,708
Forget it. I haven't got any problems.
I was out of line saying that shit.

1162
01:07:08,115 --> 01:07:09,309
Look, man....

1163
01:07:10,675 --> 01:07:11,949
Riggs, look....

1164
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:14,588
You know I love you.

1165
01:07:15,635 --> 01:07:19,469
You know I love you, Riggs.
And your problems are my problems.

1166
01:07:20,915 --> 01:07:23,304
Like you said, what happens to you...

1167
01:07:23,795 --> 01:07:25,786
...happens to me. So try me.

1168
01:07:26,115 --> 01:07:27,468
I'm here for you.

1169
01:07:28,075 --> 01:07:30,145
I haven't got any problems.

1170
01:07:30,795 --> 01:07:33,992
Yes, you do. We all have problems.
You help me...

1171
01:07:34,915 --> 01:07:36,633
...and I'm gonna help you.

1172
01:07:39,315 --> 01:07:41,306
I do have a little problem.

1173
01:07:42,755 --> 01:07:45,349
You don't want to hear it.
This is piddly shit.

1174
01:07:45,475 --> 01:07:47,306
Yes, I do. I want to hear it.

1175
01:07:47,395 --> 01:07:49,306
-Tell me.
-This is ridiculous.

1176
01:07:49,475 --> 01:07:52,194
-You don't want to hear it.
-I'm here. I'm here.

1177
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:53,550
Well....

1178
01:07:54,435 --> 01:07:58,269
I think maybe I slept with someone
that I probably shouldn't have.

1179
01:08:00,115 --> 01:08:01,548
You son of a bitch!

1180
01:08:08,475 --> 01:08:09,510
Help me.

1181
01:08:09,635 --> 01:08:11,865
I ought to let you drown, you traitor.

1182
01:08:11,955 --> 01:08:12,910
Help me.

1183
01:08:13,195 --> 01:08:14,548
Come on in.

1184
01:08:18,635 --> 01:08:19,988
What did you hit me for?

1185
01:08:20,075 --> 01:08:21,952
'Cause you slept with Rianne.

1186
01:08:23,355 --> 01:08:24,390
I did not.

1187
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:27,433
-Who did you sleep with?
-I slept with Sergeant Cole.

1188
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:29,513
Sergeant Cole from Traffic?

1189
01:08:29,595 --> 01:08:31,711
No, not Sergeant Cole from Traffic.

1190
01:08:32,795 --> 01:08:34,626
Lorna. Sergeant Cole from Traffic
is her uncle.

1191
01:08:34,715 --> 01:08:37,354
-Okay. That's okay.
-Oh, I don't know.

1192
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:41,149
Sheriff's Department.

1193
01:08:41,235 --> 01:08:42,190
Sheriff....

1194
01:08:42,275 --> 01:08:43,628
We're LAPD.

1195
01:08:44,835 --> 01:08:46,985
What are you boys doing down there?

1196
01:08:47,515 --> 01:08:49,870
-We're in the middle of a case.
-Yeah.

1197
01:08:50,035 --> 01:08:51,150
Of Scotch.

1198
01:08:53,275 --> 01:08:54,913
Let's get out of here.

1199
01:09:09,435 --> 01:09:11,107
Go with the grain.

1200
01:09:14,395 --> 01:09:16,033
I'll show you. Here.

1201
01:09:18,355 --> 01:09:20,266
You're going against the grain.

1202
01:09:24,755 --> 01:09:26,108
-Like that.
-Okay.

1203
01:09:32,915 --> 01:09:34,109
Are you okay?

1204
01:09:37,155 --> 01:09:39,146
Darryl was my friend, Dad.

1205
01:09:40,795 --> 01:09:42,751
I know. I'm sorry, Son.

1206
01:09:44,075 --> 01:09:45,952
I hope you don't blame me.

1207
01:09:47,315 --> 01:09:48,907
I don't blame you, Dad.

1208
01:09:49,915 --> 01:09:51,314
I blame Darryl.

1209
01:09:55,395 --> 01:09:57,033
What's this right here?

1210
01:10:02,915 --> 01:10:04,428
I love you, Dad.

1211
01:10:07,315 --> 01:10:08,907
I love you, Son.

1212
01:10:28,755 --> 01:10:32,191
May he find the peace in Heaven
that eluded him on earth.

1213
01:10:32,355 --> 01:10:34,107
And may the scourge of violence...

1214
01:10:34,195 --> 01:10:37,665
...claiming the lives of our children
be lifted by Your grace...

1215
01:10:37,755 --> 01:10:39,347
...and infinite wisdom.

1216
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:41,310
Amen.

1217
01:11:08,275 --> 01:11:09,390
Wait here.

1218
01:11:15,155 --> 01:11:16,554
Mrs. Smithers....

1219
01:11:16,635 --> 01:11:17,704
Ma'am?

1220
01:11:21,035 --> 01:11:22,593
I just don't know...

1221
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:31,309
You want to do something,
Sergeant Murtaugh?

1222
01:11:31,395 --> 01:11:32,794
You find the man...

1223
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:35,070
...that put the gun in my son's hand.

1224
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,393
Take your mama to the car.

1225
01:11:59,115 --> 01:12:00,309
Are you okay?

1226
01:12:00,955 --> 01:12:01,910
Yeah.

1227
01:12:02,715 --> 01:12:04,068
Who's got the gun?

1228
01:12:05,835 --> 01:12:07,029
-You got it.
-Yeah.

1229
01:12:14,475 --> 01:12:17,228
-Where did this gun come from?
-Fuck you!

1230
01:12:18,795 --> 01:12:22,310
Ever heard of the word "genocide"?
Have you, stupid motherfucker?

1231
01:12:22,395 --> 01:12:23,987
Have you ever heard of genocide?

1232
01:12:24,075 --> 01:12:25,952
You fools are killing yourselves!
You're killing us!

1233
01:12:26,035 --> 01:12:28,026
I'm tired of it! I'm tired of it!
Motherfucker!

1234
01:12:28,115 --> 01:12:31,551
You'd better tell me where this come from
or I'll blow your head off!

1235
01:12:31,635 --> 01:12:34,149
I want to know, now!
Where did it come from?

1236
01:12:40,315 --> 01:12:43,751
Do you see this gun? I want to know
where it came from! Now!

1237
01:12:46,355 --> 01:12:48,425
We're looking for your friend, Travis.

1238
01:12:48,515 --> 01:12:50,107
I've never heard of him.

1239
01:12:50,595 --> 01:12:51,948
Wrong answer.

1240
01:12:52,115 --> 01:12:54,071
You're pulling on the wrong string.

1241
01:12:54,155 --> 01:12:55,986
That's not a very professional attitude.

1242
01:12:56,075 --> 01:12:57,224
Who the fuck are you guys?

1243
01:12:57,315 --> 01:13:00,307
Sorry! LAPD. We're just doing
a few routine inquiries.

1244
01:13:00,395 --> 01:13:02,829
Have you been checked for lumps recently?

1245
01:13:03,155 --> 01:13:04,270
Give me my fucking wallet!

1246
01:13:04,355 --> 01:13:05,993
Keep your hands down!

1247
01:13:06,075 --> 01:13:07,110
My fucking wallet!

1248
01:13:07,195 --> 01:13:09,186
Get up. We don't need this!

1249
01:13:10,755 --> 01:13:14,953
We have a license that belongs to
Hubert Bartholomew Smith. Nice picture.

1250
01:13:15,075 --> 01:13:15,825
Fuck you.

1251
01:13:15,915 --> 01:13:17,553
Hey, there's a lady here.

1252
01:13:19,755 --> 01:13:21,632
What the hell's going on here?

1253
01:13:22,595 --> 01:13:24,586
-Maybe they know something.
-I'll go find out.

1254
01:13:24,675 --> 01:13:27,394
-Want me to come with you?
-No, I got it.

1255
01:13:29,595 --> 01:13:30,710
Maybe I should go with her.

1256
01:13:30,795 --> 01:13:34,151
No, I want you to see something.
She has a gift. Watch this.

1257
01:13:34,595 --> 01:13:35,994
Good morning, gentlemen.

1258
01:13:36,075 --> 01:13:38,145
LAPD. Got a few questions.

1259
01:13:38,275 --> 01:13:39,344
Are you on parole?

1260
01:13:39,435 --> 01:13:41,585
-I got a job!
-Who asked you?

1261
01:13:42,275 --> 01:13:44,072
Do any of you know a Mr. Travis?

1262
01:13:44,155 --> 01:13:45,508
You got a warrant?

1263
01:13:45,675 --> 01:13:47,233
No, but I can get one.

1264
01:13:47,315 --> 01:13:48,304
Until you do...

1265
01:13:48,395 --> 01:13:49,544
...fuck off.

1266
01:13:50,115 --> 01:13:52,310
That's not a nice thing to say to a lady.

1267
01:13:52,395 --> 01:13:53,669
Fuck you.

1268
01:13:53,955 --> 01:13:55,274
I don't think so.

1269
01:13:58,595 --> 01:13:59,789
Backspin kick.

1270
01:14:09,075 --> 01:14:10,349
Are you okay, honey?

1271
01:14:10,435 --> 01:14:11,550
Just great.

1272
01:14:17,835 --> 01:14:19,587
-"Honey?"
-How are you doing?

1273
01:14:19,675 --> 01:14:21,188
This guy's on parole.

1274
01:14:21,435 --> 01:14:23,107
This guy's an asshole!

1275
01:14:23,315 --> 01:14:25,545
-Riggs, there's five of them!
-I know.

1276
01:14:27,795 --> 01:14:28,944
Look at that.

1277
01:14:36,955 --> 01:14:38,468
Grabbed his clusters!

1278
01:14:40,475 --> 01:14:41,749
Let me help her.

1279
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:43,464
Stay still.

1280
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:57,190
My girl.

1281
01:14:59,275 --> 01:15:01,072
This PMS...is murder.

1282
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:04,308
I know what you mean.

1283
01:15:04,395 --> 01:15:06,386
I've been married 25 years.

1284
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:08,707
So, tell me about Travis.

1285
01:15:09,115 --> 01:15:11,948
I told you before, moron,
I don't know Jack Travis.

1286
01:15:12,035 --> 01:15:13,514
I didn't say his name was Jack.

1287
01:15:13,595 --> 01:15:15,233
You better start telling me
more than jackshit.

1288
01:15:15,915 --> 01:15:16,950
Come on.

1289
01:15:19,275 --> 01:15:22,711
-Men cross the street when they see me.
-I didn't have enough time.

1290
01:15:22,795 --> 01:15:26,071
I'm not your enemy, Captain.
I'm just trying to do my job.

1291
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:29,513
-Have you eaten?
-I already ate. I've gotta go downtown.

1292
01:15:29,595 --> 01:15:31,586
-What, do you eat alone?
-I'm used to it.

1293
01:15:31,675 --> 01:15:32,869
It's bad for the digestion.

1294
01:15:32,955 --> 01:15:36,027
Tomorrow, you'll have lunch with me,
but I'm not paying.

1295
01:15:42,475 --> 01:15:43,908
Are you all right?

1296
01:15:44,715 --> 01:15:46,387
Two fingers, Murph.

1297
01:15:47,595 --> 01:15:51,110
-Jack, what the fuck?
-Get in the car. I'll tell you on the way.

1298
01:15:57,355 --> 01:15:59,915
After watching Lorna
handle herself so well...

1299
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:02,430
...I'm changing my mind about kung fu.

1300
01:16:02,515 --> 01:16:04,153
Want to try it sometime?

1301
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:05,868
-No.
-Come on.

1302
01:16:06,235 --> 01:16:08,544
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.

1303
01:16:08,755 --> 01:16:10,108
Old dog, my ass.

1304
01:16:10,955 --> 01:16:14,470
Let me try something. Watch this.
It's called a backspin kick.

1305
01:16:14,835 --> 01:16:16,507
Pivot on the right, kick with your left...

1306
01:16:16,595 --> 01:16:19,667
...and you whip that head around
to catch the target over there.

1307
01:16:19,755 --> 01:16:21,950
Like this. Get that head around
and follow through.

1308
01:16:22,035 --> 01:16:22,990
Like so.

1309
01:16:23,075 --> 01:16:24,633
So, you whip the head.

1310
01:16:25,995 --> 01:16:27,030
All right?

1311
01:16:27,595 --> 01:16:29,665
Thank you. Now you try it.

1312
01:16:30,555 --> 01:16:32,466
Here's your target. All right?

1313
01:16:32,555 --> 01:16:36,548
Remember, pivot right, kick left,
get that head around, spot that target.

1314
01:16:36,715 --> 01:16:39,183
-Like that.
-Yeah. Follow the head around.

1315
01:16:39,315 --> 01:16:41,829
Back up a bit. We don't want you
to bump into the pole.

1316
01:16:41,915 --> 01:16:44,554
Just back up a little bit.
A little bit more. Okay, good.

1317
01:16:44,635 --> 01:16:46,705
Mind and body strong, now, grasshopper.

1318
01:16:46,795 --> 01:16:47,864
Okay.

1319
01:16:48,635 --> 01:16:49,590
Go.

1320
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:58,394
He can't hold his water.

1321
01:16:58,475 --> 01:16:59,954
Get back to work!

1322
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:02,226
Okay, back to work everybody.

1323
01:17:02,395 --> 01:17:04,113
Oh, Rog, I'm sorry.

1324
01:17:08,155 --> 01:17:12,592
You could be experiencing some
transitional anger caused by the shooting.

1325
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:15,272
Do you want to talk about it?

1326
01:17:15,995 --> 01:17:18,350
-He's okay for a change.
-Are you sure?

1327
01:17:18,795 --> 01:17:21,593
You look good in red. That's your color.

1328
01:17:22,315 --> 01:17:25,273
-I've got a little extra time now.
-I'm fine.

1329
01:17:30,955 --> 01:17:31,990
Oh, shit!

1330
01:17:32,235 --> 01:17:33,987
Where's Sergeant Murtaugh?

1331
01:17:34,235 --> 01:17:35,350
What?

1332
01:17:35,435 --> 01:17:36,424
It's her!

1333
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:40,550
Can you tell me where I can find
the good-looking Sergeant Murtaugh?

1334
01:17:41,035 --> 01:17:42,388
Hi, skinny!

1335
01:17:42,715 --> 01:17:44,910
-Delores. Remember me?
-I remember you.

1336
01:17:44,995 --> 01:17:47,987
Can you tell me where I can find
the lovely Sergeant Murtaugh?

1337
01:17:48,075 --> 01:17:51,750
Actually, he's cowering down
on all fours right behind this counter.

1338
01:17:54,235 --> 01:17:56,988
-Where is the sergeant?
-He's not here right now.

1339
01:17:57,355 --> 01:17:59,823
But he's talked of nothing but you all week.

1340
01:17:59,915 --> 01:18:01,985
-Shut my mouth.
-The man's on fire.

1341
01:18:02,075 --> 01:18:04,635
-What's the matter, baby?
-A little sciatica.

1342
01:18:04,715 --> 01:18:06,945
You tell him Delores was here.

1343
01:18:07,355 --> 01:18:09,027
You tell that man...

1344
01:18:09,155 --> 01:18:11,464
...that he's the jam in my jellyroll.

1345
01:18:12,275 --> 01:18:14,470
I'll see you, baby, okay. Bye-bye.

1346
01:18:15,355 --> 01:18:16,310
See you.

1347
01:18:17,955 --> 01:18:20,549
Delores says you're
"the jam in her jellyroll".

1348
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:22,103
I heard!

1349
01:18:22,715 --> 01:18:24,387
That's a lot of woman.

1350
01:18:24,715 --> 01:18:28,390
She calls me all the time. She leaves me
notes. What am I going to do?

1351
01:18:28,475 --> 01:18:30,033
You shouldn't have led her on.

1352
01:18:30,115 --> 01:18:32,470
Led her on? I didn't do anything.

1353
01:18:36,115 --> 01:18:38,345
Sergeant, we have got to talk.

1354
01:18:38,755 --> 01:18:40,711
You've got to come see me.

1355
01:18:41,515 --> 01:18:43,790
We've got to work. Come on. Let's go.

1356
01:18:44,075 --> 01:18:46,794
-Thanks anyway, for your concern.
-Thanks, Doc.

1357
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:48,069
-You're a beauty.
-Coming?

1358
01:18:48,155 --> 01:18:49,907
A real beauty. I'm coming.

1359
01:18:57,195 --> 01:18:58,787
Good afternoon, Captain.

1360
01:19:00,755 --> 01:19:03,144
That's good. See how easy that was?

1361
01:19:07,395 --> 01:19:09,226
I love it down here. Don't you?

1362
01:19:09,315 --> 01:19:12,785
This place is better than the swap meet.
Best bargains in town.

1363
01:19:17,075 --> 01:19:18,144
Give me the lock-up keys.

1364
01:19:19,355 --> 01:19:21,994
Those guys from the garage,
they're all ex-cons.

1365
01:19:22,075 --> 01:19:26,148
They were all busted by the same
police officer, Jack Edward Travis.

1366
01:19:26,315 --> 01:19:28,624
Early paroles on
the work-furlough program.

1367
01:19:28,715 --> 01:19:31,627
Employed by a company called
Mesa Verde Construction.

1368
01:19:31,995 --> 01:19:34,555
You can't go in there.
You don't have a pass.

1369
01:19:34,715 --> 01:19:36,467
-May I see your pass?
-My pass?

1370
01:19:36,555 --> 01:19:37,624
Here's my pass.

1371
01:19:37,715 --> 01:19:40,309
-I got shot in the line of duty.
-He's with us.

1372
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:42,067
-He's with us?
-I said that?

1373
01:19:42,155 --> 01:19:43,827
Where'd you get her from?

1374
01:19:43,995 --> 01:19:45,269
Why aren't you in the hospital?

1375
01:19:45,355 --> 01:19:46,629
Don't mention the hospital.

1376
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:48,831
I told you not to leave me there.
They tried to take my appendix out.

1377
01:19:48,915 --> 01:19:50,428
They gave me a lapotomy.

1378
01:19:50,515 --> 01:19:52,506
-Brain surgery?
-A lapotomy.

1379
01:19:52,635 --> 01:19:54,910
Not a lobotomy.
Cut your hair so you can hear.

1380
01:19:54,995 --> 01:19:56,064
What's the difference?

1381
01:19:56,155 --> 01:19:59,909
The difference is, for a lapotomy,
they shave your nether regions.

1382
01:20:00,075 --> 01:20:01,190
Nether what?

1383
01:20:01,635 --> 01:20:03,512
Nether.... I can't say it in front of her.

1384
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:04,789
Point to it.

1385
01:20:05,995 --> 01:20:07,314
-Here.
-It must be itchy.

1386
01:20:07,395 --> 01:20:09,909
It is itchy. These doctors are savages.

1387
01:20:09,995 --> 01:20:13,431
Where does it say that a gunshot wound
requires a rectal exam?

1388
01:20:15,675 --> 01:20:18,314
Yeah. With a telescope big enough
to see Venus.

1389
01:20:18,395 --> 01:20:19,953
I guess all they saw was Uranus.

1390
01:20:20,035 --> 01:20:22,026
That's great. Thank you.

1391
01:20:22,475 --> 01:20:23,908
You know what I say?

1392
01:20:23,995 --> 01:20:27,544
They fuck you in the hospital.
First they drug you, then they fuck you!

1393
01:20:27,635 --> 01:20:28,988
When they're done...

1394
01:20:29,075 --> 01:20:32,067
...the insurance company comes
and fucks you some more!

1395
01:20:32,195 --> 01:20:35,346
$10 for a fucking aspirin
and it isn't even covered!

1396
01:20:35,475 --> 01:20:36,544
That's enough!

1397
01:20:36,635 --> 01:20:38,227
We're trying to work here.

1398
01:20:38,315 --> 01:20:41,034
So, what's new on our case?
Anything new? You got Travis yet?

1399
01:20:41,115 --> 01:20:42,628
Did you guys advertise?

1400
01:20:42,715 --> 01:20:44,671
-He's family.
-Who's she?

1401
01:20:45,395 --> 01:20:47,704
-Sergeant Cole.
-How are you? Leo Getz.

1402
01:20:47,795 --> 01:20:49,387
Anything you need, Leo gets. Get it?

1403
01:20:49,475 --> 01:20:51,352
-I get it.
-It's real estate, now....

1404
01:20:51,435 --> 01:20:53,824
Listen, come on, you guys,
give me a break.

1405
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:56,065
I owe this guy one.
Give me something to do.

1406
01:20:56,155 --> 01:20:57,793
You can get us a cup of coffee.

1407
01:20:57,875 --> 01:21:01,265
That's great. I take one for you
and that's what you tell me?

1408
01:21:01,555 --> 01:21:04,388
-He could check this out.
-That's all I'm good for?

1409
01:21:05,755 --> 01:21:07,108
We've got something for you to do.

1410
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:11,029
Check out Mesa Verde Construction.
Find out all the information you can.

1411
01:21:11,635 --> 01:21:13,671
-Sure, I can do this.
-Can you remember that name?

1412
01:21:13,755 --> 01:21:15,268
Mesa Verde, I got it.

1413
01:21:15,435 --> 01:21:17,505
Wait, wait. What are you doing?

1414
01:21:17,595 --> 01:21:19,426
If there's any shit there, he'll find it.

1415
01:21:19,515 --> 01:21:20,709
-Who is that guy?
-It's a long story.

1416
01:21:27,635 --> 01:21:29,466
Here are your keys, Captain.

1417
01:21:30,035 --> 01:21:31,024
You motherfucker!

1418
01:21:31,115 --> 01:21:32,628
-Don't be stupid.
-What the fuck?

1419
01:21:32,715 --> 01:21:36,708
Take the elevator, get the other guys.
Keys. Give me those fucking hands.

1420
01:21:37,435 --> 01:21:39,505
Goddamn you, Travis. Fuck.

1421
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:42,754
Stand there.

1422
01:21:46,955 --> 01:21:49,515
I can get faster results than
that real estate broker.

1423
01:21:49,595 --> 01:21:51,984
Leo's not just a real estate broker.

1424
01:21:52,115 --> 01:21:54,834
He's a pain in the ass
with a lot of connections.

1425
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:59,311
This is what we came for.
Load everything on the elevator.

1426
01:21:59,395 --> 01:22:01,386
-How'd you know where to find them?
-We got it all.

1427
01:22:01,475 --> 01:22:03,386
The world of computers.

1428
01:22:03,755 --> 01:22:06,633
You used to be one of us, for Christ's sake.

1429
01:22:06,795 --> 01:22:09,434
You know what future a cop has? None.

1430
01:22:10,035 --> 01:22:12,788
Punch a clock for 30 years. Retirement.

1431
01:22:13,115 --> 01:22:14,343
Pension.

1432
01:22:14,835 --> 01:22:15,870
Nothing to do.

1433
01:22:15,955 --> 01:22:19,311
Drunk at noon, bullet in the brain
by evening. Not for this kid.

1434
01:22:19,395 --> 01:22:21,511
Police Department's got it all:

1435
01:22:21,595 --> 01:22:23,426
Guns, ammo, drugs, cash.

1436
01:22:23,515 --> 01:22:26,393
It's a one-stop shopping center
if you got the balls and the brains.

1437
01:22:26,475 --> 01:22:28,147
Not a thing anybody can do about it.

1438
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:30,590
You're already fucking history
and you know it.

1439
01:22:30,675 --> 01:22:33,064
Sorry. I'm just getting started.

1440
01:22:33,675 --> 01:22:35,586
Something's wrong here.

1441
01:22:35,675 --> 01:22:38,109
The program's been accessed
by somebody from the outside.

1442
01:22:38,195 --> 01:22:39,787
What's been accessed?

1443
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:43,231
After the guns were stolen, lnternal Affairs
moved the confiscated ammunition.

1444
01:22:43,315 --> 01:22:44,225
Armor-piercing bullets?

1445
01:22:44,315 --> 01:22:46,954
Thousands of rounds
to a more secure location.

1446
01:22:48,395 --> 01:22:50,272
-That's what's been accessed.
-Someone else knows.

1447
01:22:50,355 --> 01:22:53,074
Where's this store? Where'd they move it?

1448
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:54,789
Let's go.

1449
01:22:55,355 --> 01:22:58,552
-I'm not cut out for lnternal Affairs.
-That's a switch.

1450
01:22:58,715 --> 01:23:00,307
-Right here in the building.
-Where?

1451
01:23:00,395 --> 01:23:01,589
-I'm showing you.
-Something going down?

1452
01:23:01,675 --> 01:23:03,870
-Nothing's going down.
-I'm going with you.

1453
01:23:03,955 --> 01:23:06,423
-How old are you?
-Twenty-two today.

1454
01:23:06,675 --> 01:23:07,630
Come on.

1455
01:23:07,795 --> 01:23:09,274
Have you got protection?

1456
01:23:09,355 --> 01:23:12,028
-Right here in my wallet.
-No, your vest, you dummy!

1457
01:23:12,115 --> 01:23:13,230
Should we take him?

1458
01:23:13,315 --> 01:23:16,432
-Okay, but keep your head down.
-Stay behind me.

1459
01:23:16,635 --> 01:23:18,432
Come on, let's go. Quiet!

1460
01:23:30,555 --> 01:23:32,273
You were my ticket in.

1461
01:23:32,595 --> 01:23:34,984
It's too bad you won't be coming with me.

1462
01:23:40,155 --> 01:23:41,554
They got it all.

1463
01:23:42,875 --> 01:23:45,230
-He's dead.
-How'd they get it out of here?

1464
01:23:45,315 --> 01:23:47,271
-I don't know.
-Not upstairs.

1465
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:48,829
Elevator!

1466
01:23:51,795 --> 01:23:53,228
Shit. It's down.

1467
01:23:53,355 --> 01:23:54,708
The subway's down there.

1468
01:23:54,795 --> 01:23:56,387
-Let's take the stairs.
-LA has subways?

1469
01:23:56,475 --> 01:23:58,705
-Where've you been?
-Read something besides the comics.

1470
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:02,505
All right. Come on, let's hustle!

1471
01:24:05,035 --> 01:24:06,468
Hurry up, guys.

1472
01:24:19,035 --> 01:24:20,468
LAPD! Come here!

1473
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:22,466
Come here! Step on it!

1474
01:24:23,035 --> 01:24:24,548
Son of a bitch.

1475
01:24:24,675 --> 01:24:26,313
Did you see anybody or anything strange?

1476
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:30,149
-Lots of cops and a bunch of boxes.
-Split now. Just get out of here.

1477
01:24:31,435 --> 01:24:33,266
-I'm going across.
-I got it.

1478
01:24:39,635 --> 01:24:41,546
Get rid of Murphy, now!

1479
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:49,793
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Let's go.

1480
01:25:00,915 --> 01:25:02,428
Let's get out of here!

1481
01:25:03,955 --> 01:25:04,990
Cover me!

1482
01:25:24,715 --> 01:25:25,784
Let's go!

1483
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:37,108
Stay still.

1484
01:25:46,755 --> 01:25:48,268
Happy birthday, kid.

1485
01:26:13,435 --> 01:26:14,754
Another baby.

1486
01:26:27,155 --> 01:26:28,634
Is he dead? Check the body.

1487
01:26:28,715 --> 01:26:29,625
Get me out of here!

1488
01:26:31,715 --> 01:26:33,512
Hey, Riggs! Hey, Riggs!

1489
01:26:33,595 --> 01:26:34,584
Riggs!

1490
01:26:34,675 --> 01:26:36,188
Stupid son of a bitch!

1491
01:26:47,675 --> 01:26:48,664
Stop that!

1492
01:26:48,755 --> 01:26:49,710
Cut it out!

1493
01:26:49,795 --> 01:26:51,353
-Don't shoot!
-LAPD!

1494
01:26:51,755 --> 01:26:52,744
Where does this lead?

1495
01:26:52,835 --> 01:26:54,427
-Pico Station.
-Thanks.

1496
01:26:54,555 --> 01:26:55,624
Not that way.

1497
01:26:55,715 --> 01:26:57,910
Take the stairs, it's faster.

1498
01:27:10,995 --> 01:27:12,223
Gangway!

1499
01:27:19,635 --> 01:27:21,353
Get out of the way!

1500
01:27:24,195 --> 01:27:25,264
Holy shit!

1501
01:27:25,795 --> 01:27:27,023
Son of a bitch!

1502
01:27:27,555 --> 01:27:28,749
Police!

1503
01:27:35,395 --> 01:27:37,226
Step on it! There he is!

1504
01:27:38,995 --> 01:27:40,110
Goddamn!

1505
01:27:44,995 --> 01:27:46,713
Put your foot down!

1506
01:28:12,515 --> 01:28:13,550
Police!

1507
01:28:14,275 --> 01:28:15,230
I need your bike.

1508
01:28:15,315 --> 01:28:16,748
This is bullshit!

1509
01:28:16,955 --> 01:28:20,231
Sergeant Riggs, call it in.
I need a couple of clips, too.

1510
01:28:35,115 --> 01:28:36,673
Okay, we lost him.

1511
01:28:43,635 --> 01:28:45,114
Where's Riggs?

1512
01:28:46,115 --> 01:28:48,709
Keep me in touch
with the motorcycle pursuit.

1513
01:28:55,315 --> 01:28:56,953
-Shit!
-Take a right, now!

1514
01:28:57,115 --> 01:28:58,514
Take a right! Go!

1515
01:28:59,155 --> 01:29:00,383
Go! Go! Go!

1516
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:03,706
Take a right! No, left!

1517
01:29:43,235 --> 01:29:45,430
This is 6-William-6, this is 6-William-6.

1518
01:29:45,515 --> 01:29:47,187
I'm at the freeway construction site.

1519
01:29:47,275 --> 01:29:49,266
Where's Riggs? I'm here. Where's Riggs?

1520
01:29:49,355 --> 01:29:50,993
Come back to me, Central.

1521
01:29:51,875 --> 01:29:53,547
Where the hell is Riggs?

1522
01:29:54,955 --> 01:29:56,308
Take a left here! Get off!

1523
01:29:56,395 --> 01:29:57,828
Get off the freeway!

1524
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:10,423
Stop! Hold it!

1525
01:30:12,675 --> 01:30:13,744
Shit!

1526
01:30:13,835 --> 01:30:14,824
Hang on!

1527
01:30:29,555 --> 01:30:31,113
Where is the pursuit?

1528
01:30:34,915 --> 01:30:35,870
Shit!

1529
01:30:48,435 --> 01:30:49,345
Riggs!

1530
01:30:49,955 --> 01:30:50,990
Relax, Riggs.

1531
01:30:51,075 --> 01:30:52,030
Relax?

1532
01:30:56,675 --> 01:30:57,790
Shit!

1533
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:09,665
Riggs.

1534
01:31:11,995 --> 01:31:13,986
Just get back! Get back!

1535
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:16,193
Riggs, talk to me.

1536
01:31:17,195 --> 01:31:18,753
Riggs, you're alive.

1537
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:21,433
Don't move. Don't move!

1538
01:31:21,515 --> 01:31:22,948
Just get back!

1539
01:31:23,595 --> 01:31:24,994
Are you all right?

1540
01:31:31,715 --> 01:31:32,943
Don't touch me!

1541
01:31:33,035 --> 01:31:35,469
Okay, okay! I'm not touching you!

1542
01:31:36,515 --> 01:31:38,267
Don't touch me! Don't!

1543
01:31:43,235 --> 01:31:45,624
-Don't touch me!
-I won't touch you!

1544
01:31:49,835 --> 01:31:52,907
-Are you okay now?
-I'm pissed now. Now I'm pissed.

1545
01:31:52,995 --> 01:31:54,348
-Now what?
-That bastard!

1546
01:31:54,435 --> 01:31:56,505
He's done it twice now. Damn!

1547
01:31:56,675 --> 01:31:59,587
Son of a gun, I'll suck his eyes down
through his nose.

1548
01:31:59,675 --> 01:32:02,553
Twice he got away.
Nobody gets away from me.

1549
01:32:03,075 --> 01:32:04,428
Just relax.

1550
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:06,706
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

1551
01:32:06,795 --> 01:32:08,706
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

1552
01:32:13,595 --> 01:32:15,187
-I'm having that!
-You quit!

1553
01:32:15,275 --> 01:32:17,994
I ran out of biscuits, okay?
Give me a break.

1554
01:32:18,995 --> 01:32:20,269
Oh, shit!

1555
01:32:21,515 --> 01:32:22,550
Oh, shit!

1556
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:27,830
Perfect.

1557
01:32:29,275 --> 01:32:31,186
What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

1558
01:32:31,675 --> 01:32:33,825
-What are you doing here?
-Great car chase.

1559
01:32:33,915 --> 01:32:35,746
-Great chase!
-What are you doing here?

1560
01:32:35,835 --> 01:32:37,666
-How'd you find us?
-Police scanner.

1561
01:32:37,755 --> 01:32:40,144
What are you doing with a police scanner?

1562
01:32:40,795 --> 01:32:44,231
Hello, Car 54, where are you?
I cracked this case for you guys.

1563
01:32:44,395 --> 01:32:46,386
Listen! Mesa Verde's legit.

1564
01:32:46,555 --> 01:32:48,989
They got a housing project,
called Rancho Arroyo.

1565
01:32:49,075 --> 01:32:51,430
-I know where that is!
-Why don't we check it out?

1566
01:32:51,515 --> 01:32:53,153
-That's a good idea.
-Yeah, okay.

1567
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:54,304
I'll come with you.

1568
01:32:54,395 --> 01:32:56,989
-You're not coming with us.
-Yes, I am. I'll take my car.

1569
01:32:57,075 --> 01:32:58,827
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

1570
01:33:00,475 --> 01:33:03,114
I can't believe you did that! I got a spare!

1571
01:33:06,315 --> 01:33:07,828
-You're driving!
-No, I'm driving!

1572
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:10,383
How could you do that?
I can't believe you did that!

1573
01:33:10,475 --> 01:33:11,749
I can't believe you did that!

1574
01:33:11,835 --> 01:33:13,154
Where's Lorna?

1575
01:33:13,435 --> 01:33:15,346
I can't believe you did that!

1576
01:33:19,075 --> 01:33:20,952
How could you do that to me?

1577
01:33:22,315 --> 01:33:23,270
Did you see that?

1578
01:33:23,355 --> 01:33:26,233
They're my partners.
I can't believe they did that!

1579
01:33:26,675 --> 01:33:27,824
Do you own your home?

1580
01:34:00,715 --> 01:34:03,275
-Looks like we came to the right place.
-Yeah.

1581
01:34:03,435 --> 01:34:05,346
Move on out to Travis Town.

1582
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:07,506
Great place to raise a family.

1583
01:34:07,995 --> 01:34:10,065
Built on guns and bloodshed.

1584
01:34:10,235 --> 01:34:12,669
One hell of a retirement plan
this asshole's got.

1585
01:34:12,755 --> 01:34:15,269
Let's foreclose on this son of a bitch.

1586
01:34:15,835 --> 01:34:18,030
-Say, is that...
-Darryl's gun.

1587
01:34:18,515 --> 01:34:21,109
-I was saving it for the right occasion.
-This is it.

1588
01:34:21,195 --> 01:34:23,231
-How many men do you think he has?
-Who knows?

1589
01:34:23,315 --> 01:34:25,431
Maybe I should run over there
and ask him?

1590
01:34:25,515 --> 01:34:26,994
That'd be too easy.

1591
01:34:27,075 --> 01:34:29,430
Wish I had some grenades
or a rocket launcher.

1592
01:34:29,515 --> 01:34:31,426
Maybe a ground-to-air missile.

1593
01:34:31,915 --> 01:34:34,304
I wonder what Murphy's got in his trunk.

1594
01:34:36,235 --> 01:34:38,669
It's obvious, Murphy was never
a Boy Scout.

1595
01:34:39,035 --> 01:34:40,866
Not even a good spare.

1596
01:34:44,475 --> 01:34:46,864
Put your hands down. It's embarrassing.

1597
01:34:49,315 --> 01:34:50,543
How're you doing?

1598
01:34:50,635 --> 01:34:51,545
Kissing.

1599
01:34:51,635 --> 01:34:52,784
Fresh ones?

1600
01:34:53,075 --> 01:34:54,872
Oh, yeah. Shaving cuts.

1601
01:34:54,955 --> 01:34:56,388
No points for those.

1602
01:34:56,475 --> 01:34:58,306
-How'd you get here?
-Drove.

1603
01:34:59,315 --> 01:35:02,591
I ran into Leo at the police station.
He talked to me first.

1604
01:35:02,675 --> 01:35:05,109
-Any ideas?
-Lucky thing we've got a plan.

1605
01:35:05,275 --> 01:35:06,469
Lucky thing. What is it?

1606
01:35:06,555 --> 01:35:08,307
I want it to be a surprise.

1607
01:35:09,035 --> 01:35:10,548
I like surprises.

1608
01:35:15,835 --> 01:35:17,063
Move it!

1609
01:35:19,355 --> 01:35:21,186
-Check it out.
-Let's go.

1610
01:35:37,795 --> 01:35:40,468
-Look what they did to Murph's car.
-It could've been worse.

1611
01:35:40,555 --> 01:35:43,945
-It could've been yours.
-Worse, it could've been Trish's car.

1612
01:35:44,635 --> 01:35:45,670
-On three.
-Three.

1613
01:35:45,755 --> 01:35:46,904
Three?

1614
01:35:48,315 --> 01:35:49,430
One...

1615
01:35:50,515 --> 01:35:51,664
-...two....
-Three!

1616
01:35:51,755 --> 01:35:53,029
Police! Freeze!

1617
01:35:54,635 --> 01:35:55,670
Oh, shit!

1618
01:36:05,595 --> 01:36:07,347
-Go! Let's go!
-Right now!

1619
01:36:14,755 --> 01:36:17,508
What's wrong with you?
I said go on three, not two!

1620
01:36:17,595 --> 01:36:18,630
On three!

1621
01:36:18,955 --> 01:36:20,274
It's always three!

1622
01:36:20,355 --> 01:36:21,310
Boys!

1623
01:36:22,155 --> 01:36:25,113
What are we doing here?
Losing our heads in a crisis?

1624
01:36:28,035 --> 01:36:29,514
Cover me! Cover me!

1625
01:36:48,195 --> 01:36:49,310
Exxon.

1626
01:36:51,235 --> 01:36:52,634
Hey, Rog....

1627
01:36:53,755 --> 01:36:55,188
-What?
-Count to 20!

1628
01:36:55,875 --> 01:36:56,466
What?

1629
01:36:56,555 --> 01:36:58,546
Count to 20 and then light me!

1630
01:37:02,955 --> 01:37:03,865
Shit!

1631
01:37:06,275 --> 01:37:08,152
Riggs, it's loaded with ammo!

1632
01:37:21,395 --> 01:37:22,987
-Cover me.
-Cover you?

1633
01:37:24,835 --> 01:37:26,188
Cover you, cover Riggs.

1634
01:37:26,275 --> 01:37:28,743
When's someone gonna cover me
for a change?

1635
01:37:33,475 --> 01:37:35,943
What's that, 13, 14? To hell with it!

1636
01:37:51,595 --> 01:37:54,109
It's the cops. They're burning everything!

1637
01:38:05,235 --> 01:38:06,111
Son of a bitch!

1638
01:38:06,195 --> 01:38:07,913
Crazy motherfucker!

1639
01:38:11,955 --> 01:38:12,831
Damn!

1640
01:38:12,915 --> 01:38:15,031
Riggs, the ammo! Get out of there!

1641
01:38:30,715 --> 01:38:32,387
You crazy son of a bitch!

1642
01:38:32,955 --> 01:38:33,990
Yeah!

1643
01:38:49,275 --> 01:38:51,505
Son of a bitch. You're full of shit.

1644
01:38:55,435 --> 01:38:56,550
Stay there.

1645
01:38:56,955 --> 01:38:58,388
Shit, where's Riggs?

1646
01:39:11,955 --> 01:39:13,593
Son of a bitch! No clip!

1647
01:39:15,835 --> 01:39:17,234
Lorna, no, don't!

1648
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:25,228
Come on in, bitch.

1649
01:39:25,795 --> 01:39:27,114
The door's open!

1650
01:39:50,035 --> 01:39:52,105
I'm gonna eat your fucking heart!

1651
01:40:18,195 --> 01:40:19,674
Son of a bitch.

1652
01:40:21,795 --> 01:40:22,989
Travis!

1653
01:40:24,755 --> 01:40:25,631
Shit!

1654
01:40:39,195 --> 01:40:41,072
Armor-piercing bullets, yeah.

1655
01:40:41,235 --> 01:40:42,509
Cop killers.

1656
01:40:43,755 --> 01:40:45,393
You're coming with me!

1657
01:40:53,555 --> 01:40:54,954
Fuck you, asshole!

1658
01:41:07,275 --> 01:41:09,345
Riggs. Hey, Riggs. Riggs!

1659
01:41:12,715 --> 01:41:13,830
Get up!

1660
01:41:14,915 --> 01:41:15,904
Get up!

1661
01:41:16,515 --> 01:41:18,585
Killed in the line of duty!

1662
01:41:22,235 --> 01:41:25,193
You'll get a great funeral
from the Department.

1663
01:41:30,955 --> 01:41:32,354
Cop killers!

1664
01:41:43,995 --> 01:41:45,508
Ex-cop killers.

1665
01:41:55,515 --> 01:41:57,187
Go to hell, Riggs.

1666
01:41:58,435 --> 01:41:59,584
You first.

1667
01:42:09,835 --> 01:42:11,348
Crazy son of a bitch!

1668
01:42:16,875 --> 01:42:19,389
Sorry, honey, I gotta do it. I gotta look.

1669
01:42:21,515 --> 01:42:23,426
Just hold still. Hold still.

1670
01:42:23,515 --> 01:42:25,585
Get a chopper, man! Get a chopper.

1671
01:42:25,835 --> 01:42:28,030
She had two vests on.
She's gonna be okay.

1672
01:42:28,115 --> 01:42:30,390
A couple of bad ones.
We need to get a chopper.

1673
01:42:30,475 --> 01:42:32,989
You're all right, partner. Hang on.

1674
01:42:34,555 --> 01:42:37,513
It's okay, it's okay. Just lie still.
Just lie still.

1675
01:42:37,595 --> 01:42:40,632
Just a romantic evening by the fire,
just the two of us.

1676
01:42:40,875 --> 01:42:42,149
Just be still.

1677
01:42:51,675 --> 01:42:54,235
Honey, open your eyes. Open your eyes.

1678
01:42:54,715 --> 01:42:55,989
Open your eyes.

1679
01:42:59,715 --> 01:43:01,831
What are you trying to prove out there?

1680
01:43:01,915 --> 01:43:03,348
Why do you do that?

1681
01:43:03,835 --> 01:43:05,587
-Can I take this off?
-Yeah.

1682
01:43:07,515 --> 01:43:11,349
You're supposed to grow old
with someone, not because of them.

1683
01:43:16,955 --> 01:43:18,513
I'm gonna be with you.

1684
01:43:19,035 --> 01:43:20,991
I'm with you now. Look, I'm right here.

1685
01:43:21,075 --> 01:43:23,066
We're both here, right? Right.

1686
01:43:24,875 --> 01:43:26,831
Come on, I want to be with you.

1687
01:43:26,915 --> 01:43:28,712
What have you got to lose?

1688
01:43:29,675 --> 01:43:30,630
You.

1689
01:43:32,635 --> 01:43:33,909
Not likely.

1690
01:43:39,155 --> 01:43:40,634
-Hey, Lorna.
-Yeah?

1691
01:43:43,435 --> 01:43:45,346
Let's live to regret this.

1692
01:43:49,835 --> 01:43:51,587
-We've got to go, Sarge.
-Okay.

1693
01:43:51,675 --> 01:43:53,108
She's gonna be fine.

1694
01:43:56,875 --> 01:43:58,228
Can you hear me?

1695
01:43:59,675 --> 01:44:00,790
I love you.

1696
01:44:17,555 --> 01:44:19,511
"Happy retirement, Daddy

1697
01:44:22,275 --> 01:44:24,266
"Happy retirement, Daddy"

1698
01:44:26,395 --> 01:44:28,465
This is it. This is the day.

1699
01:44:29,355 --> 01:44:30,708
Everybody? Daddy?

1700
01:44:30,795 --> 01:44:33,355
I want you to know there's a candle
for every year in the Force.

1701
01:44:33,435 --> 01:44:35,232
Yes! A lot of years.

1702
01:44:35,835 --> 01:44:38,065
-You have to blow it out.
-Come on!

1703
01:44:40,315 --> 01:44:41,145
I can't.

1704
01:44:41,235 --> 01:44:43,908
-Come on, blow it out.
-That's not what I mean.

1705
01:44:44,155 --> 01:44:45,270
What?

1706
01:44:45,915 --> 01:44:47,428
I can't retire.

1707
01:44:48,715 --> 01:44:50,785
I thought I could. I wanted to.

1708
01:44:52,155 --> 01:44:53,270
But I can't.

1709
01:44:57,475 --> 01:44:59,591
That means you're gonna
stay with the Force?

1710
01:44:59,675 --> 01:45:02,189
That means I'm staying
with the Force, baby.

1711
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:08,469
This cake's about to explode,
so you'd better blow out these candles.

1712
01:45:09,555 --> 01:45:12,547
I want you to know that
I'm behind you all the way.

1713
01:45:13,035 --> 01:45:14,866
-Me, too.
-So am l, Dad.

1714
01:45:14,955 --> 01:45:16,070
It's okay.

1715
01:45:16,155 --> 01:45:19,511
Well, the streets will be safer
for another couple of years.

1716
01:45:21,075 --> 01:45:22,508
"Word", Nick?

1717
01:45:22,635 --> 01:45:23,829
"Word", Dad.

1718
01:45:26,635 --> 01:45:28,114
Blow them out!

1719
01:45:29,075 --> 01:45:30,224
Hello?

1720
01:45:30,355 --> 01:45:31,947
Hello! ln here!

1721
01:45:32,715 --> 01:45:34,626
Hello. I gotta talk to Roger.

1722
01:45:36,235 --> 01:45:37,463
Oprah should see this.

1723
01:45:37,555 --> 01:45:39,830
I can't believe this! Okay, this is great!

1724
01:45:39,915 --> 01:45:41,234
What is it?

1725
01:45:41,395 --> 01:45:44,865
Where's Riggs? I didn't know
he could hold his breath that long.

1726
01:45:45,355 --> 01:45:46,583
I'm taking a bath, Leo.

1727
01:45:46,675 --> 01:45:50,190
I can see that. And it's cold water, too.
There goes your image.

1728
01:45:51,275 --> 01:45:52,947
Listen, I got great news.

1729
01:45:53,035 --> 01:45:55,503
Once again, Leo Getz has delivered.

1730
01:45:55,915 --> 01:45:57,985
Okay, I have sold this turkey.

1731
01:45:58,635 --> 01:46:01,593
This termite-infested dump is now gone.
Okay?

1732
01:46:03,195 --> 01:46:06,551
All you have to do is sign the contract
before the suckers change their mind.

1733
01:46:06,635 --> 01:46:08,705
Okay? I did it! I did it!

1734
01:46:09,355 --> 01:46:10,788
The house is off the market.

1735
01:46:10,875 --> 01:46:14,629
We're gonna stay in this "termite-infested
turkey" for another ten years!

1736
01:46:14,715 --> 01:46:17,104
-At least!
-I'll get married here!

1737
01:46:17,715 --> 01:46:19,626
-Come on, out.
-You can't do this.

1738
01:46:19,715 --> 01:46:21,945
-Out, out.
-No, you can't do that.

1739
01:46:22,515 --> 01:46:25,234
You can't do that. I have contracts signed.

1740
01:46:25,395 --> 01:46:27,750
Because we're partners,
no commission. Okay?

1741
01:46:27,835 --> 01:46:28,665
Partners?

1742
01:46:28,755 --> 01:46:30,871
You and Riggs owe me two new tires.

1743
01:46:30,955 --> 01:46:31,865
Why?

1744
01:46:31,955 --> 01:46:35,186
Because bullets aren't covered
in normal road hazard. That's why!

1745
01:46:35,275 --> 01:46:37,266
I want those tires! No conditions!

1746
01:46:37,355 --> 01:46:38,868
Leo, get out of here!

1747
01:46:38,955 --> 01:46:41,071
-Don't tell me to get out!
-Out! Out!

1748
01:46:41,155 --> 01:46:43,908
Okay, I'm going.
You're lucky your wife's here!

1749
01:46:47,595 --> 01:46:49,153
Don't come crying to me if the...

1750
01:46:49,235 --> 01:46:49,951
Get out!

1751
01:46:50,035 --> 01:46:51,991
-Termites get...
-No more!

1752
01:46:55,115 --> 01:46:56,389
Your friends.

1753
01:46:58,195 --> 01:47:00,550
Ten more years till Force retirement.

1754
01:47:02,155 --> 01:47:03,827
That's 3,650 days.

1755
01:47:06,435 --> 01:47:08,266
-Forty-nine.
-Oh, yeah.

1756
01:47:19,315 --> 01:47:20,907
I gotta improve my image.

1757
01:47:32,075 --> 01:47:33,428
Bye, Daddy!

1758
01:47:36,075 --> 01:47:37,349
Bye, baby.

1759
01:47:46,275 --> 01:47:47,947
What are you smiling at?

1760
01:47:48,915 --> 01:47:50,394
Why weren't you at my party?

1761
01:47:50,475 --> 01:47:52,033
I knew you weren't going to retire.

1762
01:47:52,115 --> 01:47:55,664
I've been wrong about a couple of things
in my life, but I knew you wouldn't retire.

1763
01:47:55,755 --> 01:47:57,905
Well, I knew you couldn't stop smoking.

1764
01:47:57,995 --> 01:48:00,634
I'm smoking to forget
my dog-biscuit problem.

1765
01:48:00,715 --> 01:48:02,034
What "dog-biscuit problem"?

1766
01:48:02,115 --> 01:48:04,231
I've been chasing more cars lately...

1767
01:48:04,315 --> 01:48:07,068
...and when I try to lick my balls,
I keep falling off the couch.

1768
01:48:07,155 --> 01:48:08,474
Jesus Christ.

1769
01:48:09,275 --> 01:48:10,947
I'm driving. Other side.

1770
01:48:11,115 --> 01:48:13,913
I've got no dispute. I just came over
to open the door for you.

1771
01:48:13,995 --> 01:48:15,474
Thank you for opening it.

1772
01:48:15,555 --> 01:48:17,830
Do you need some help?
An old fella like you needs....

1773
01:48:17,915 --> 01:48:19,189
I'll show you how a fella my age is.

1774
01:48:19,275 --> 01:48:21,914
-Who's a grumpy bastard?
-I'm a grumpy bastard.

1775
01:48:22,315 --> 01:48:23,953
-You know something?
-What?

1776
01:48:24,035 --> 01:48:27,550
When I do retire, I hope
your next partner is just like you.

1777
01:48:27,955 --> 01:48:31,664
There's winners and there's losers,
and God wouldn't do that to me.

1778
01:48:31,835 --> 01:48:33,234
He did it to me.

1779
01:48:33,835 --> 01:48:34,790
I know.

1780
01:48:36,155 --> 01:48:37,474
See what I mean?

1781
01:48:39,395 --> 01:48:40,748
My point, exactly.

1782
01:48:40,835 --> 01:48:42,234
Son of a bitch!

1783
01:48:45,635 --> 01:48:47,148
Stay away from my daughter!

1784
01:48:47,235 --> 01:48:49,624
You can't be serious?
What are you talking about?

1785
01:48:49,715 --> 01:48:51,194
I saw you kiss Rianne.

1786
01:48:51,275 --> 01:48:53,231
She kissed me. She finds me irresistible.

1787
01:48:53,315 --> 01:48:56,273
-That's not the point!
-It was a platonic peck on the cheek.

1788
01:48:56,355 --> 01:48:58,994
If it'sjust friendship,
try shaking hands next time.

1789
01:48:59,075 --> 01:49:02,033
-Are you getting enough fiber in your diet?
-I'm getting enough fiber!

1790
01:49:02,115 --> 01:49:03,867
I'm spoken for, okay?

1791
01:49:04,035 --> 01:49:06,754
I'm gonna pick Lorna up
from the hospital this afternoon.

1792
01:49:06,835 --> 01:49:08,154
We're practically....

1793
01:49:08,235 --> 01:49:10,669
-You're serious?
-We've got a dog and everything.

1794
01:49:10,755 --> 01:49:12,985
I figure I can make ends meet.

1795
01:49:21,795 --> 01:49:24,389
All units! All units! Code 2, High.

1796
01:49:24,835 --> 01:49:27,349
Don't even think about it. Don't even try.

1797
01:49:27,435 --> 01:49:30,507
This is us, rolling to Code 2, High,
at Verrina Place.

1798
01:49:30,595 --> 01:49:33,393
Shit. This time we wait
for the bomb squad.

1799
01:49:33,475 --> 01:49:36,114
Do you think I want to end up
in uniform again?

1800

Subtitles conformed by SOFTITLER

1801
01:52:31,075 --> 01:52:34,670
20-William-12, the REA Bomb Squad's
en route. All units.

1802
01:52:35,235 --> 01:52:37,510
Those guys gonna get in the way again?

1803
01:52:37,755 --> 01:52:39,791
There it is. Happy? Let's go.

1804
01:52:39,955 --> 01:52:41,946
We ain't seen nothing yet, Rog.

1805
01:52:42,035 --> 01:52:44,310
-Get me closer.
-It's roped off!

1806
01:52:44,435 --> 01:52:47,745
-Can't see the bomb squad anywhere.
-They're coming!

1807
01:52:47,955 --> 01:52:50,150
Stop here and I'lljust get out.

1808
01:52:50,395 --> 01:52:52,545
No, don't get out of the car, Riggs!

1809
01:52:52,875 --> 01:52:55,150
Tell me, was it the red wire or blue...

1810
01:52:55,275 --> 01:52:57,425
-Let's get out of here.
-Step on the gas!

1811
01:52:57,515 --> 01:52:58,868
They'll never believe this!

1812
01:52:58,955 --> 01:53:01,310
-I hope nobody saw us.
-They'll blame us.

1813
01:53:01,715 --> 01:53:04,946
Let's keep cool. You'd better
get your girdle out of mothballs.

1814
01:53:05,035 --> 01:53:07,344
They'll say, "Back in uniform again".

1815
01:53:07,435 --> 01:53:09,232
Ten more years of this!

1816
01:53:09,795 --> 01:53:12,832
-I'm too old for this shit.
-I'm too old for this shit.
