my father keeps his cigars.

And call me silly,
but I'm worried...

65
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,930
that you're gonna end up
in the hospital or somethin'
like last year.

66

- Or in jail like you did
the year before.

Yeah, this is gonna be good.
- Come on. Everything' s okay.

68
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:44,613
But here's the thing.
you've gone fishin' every year
since before we knew you,

69
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:48,016
and so far everything
has never been okay and fine.

70
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,612
And you've never been
as far away as Florida.

71
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,626
But that's why this trip is so nice.
that's why it's so important.

we're goin' to the Everglades.

00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,065
- Catch this.
- I know you'll love that.

76
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,695
If you two are not back
by Thanksgiving,

77
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,173
we have agreed to kill you.

78
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,800

00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,812
- Yeah.
- If a great football player
got a bad football...

165
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,823
- he's still a great football player.
- Exactly.

166
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,325
Hey, how about this clean,
fresh Florida air?

167
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,659
[Inhales] Hey, a real Florida
palm tree in the flesh.

168
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,359
Holy smoke! Gus,
I never thought I' d see a palm tree.

169
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:38,130
- I feel like a million dollars, Joe.
- I feel like two million.

170
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,831
[Laughing]
let's go eat.

171
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,841
- And then fish.
- Yeah.

172
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:47,437
No, no. You got the last one.
it's on me. Forget about it.

173
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,071
Hey, Joe, check out
them ugly sticks.

174
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,150
Hey, don't say that.

175
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:55,676
- They gonna break.
- [Woman] You got number nine ready?

176
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,054
- [Man] Here you go.
- let's sit over here.
Hey, don't say that.

177
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,889
Hey, Gus, I can't
believe you. You tell me,
"Look at these ugly chicks."

178
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,588
I was gonna laugh right
in their faces over there.

179
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,825
I said, "Ugly sticks."
For fishin'.

180
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,232
Oh, I thought you said
"ugly chicks"' cause this
girl' s sittin' there.

181
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:14,102
You gotta have ugly sticks
here because they feed
a lot of fishermen.

182
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,901
- Hiya.
- Hi.

183
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,408
Y' all know
what you want?

184
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,501
Uh...

185
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,206
Hey, Gus. What do you
think, Gus? Should I get
this Southern Plate?

186
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,612
Then you can have
my toast and my bacon.

187
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,912
Yeah, then I'll get the
Fisherman' s Feast, and you can
have my sausage and pancakes.

188
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,953
If you're gonna do that,

189
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,114
why don't I get
the Mariner and you can have
the whole side of ham?

190
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,124
Oh, never mind us.
This happens all the time.

191
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:37,059
Must be enjoyable for ya.

192
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:41,623
May I suggest
the Panama Platter?
It really hit the spot.

193
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,635
Oh, yeah? Thanks.

194
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,729
Um... what do you think?
Shall we get a couple of those?

195
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,831
- Yeah, a couple of those.
- [Waitress] Two of those?

196
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,638
- A couple of those, yeah.
- Yeah. Thanks.

197
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,279
- Gus, check this out.
- Yeah.

198
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:59,044
- Pure Billy "Catch" Pooler.
Watch this.
- Okay.

199
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,178
Back, drop.

200
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,586
- Back, drop.
- Y-you're flickin' too much.

201
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:07,285
- I can't get the flick.
- Okay, wait. Let me show you.

202
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,294
Which is the flick?
Which is the dip?

203
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,297
Think of flick
instead of flip.

204
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,128
- Flick.
- Flick, dip.

205
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,601
See, I can't...
I get the flick and the dip
mix ed all the time.

206
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,898
- Uh, pardon me.
- Oh, sorry.

207
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:23,497
- I couldn't help noticing you have a
fishing lure on your key ring.
- Yeah.

208
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,442
- That wouldn't be
a deadly invader, would it?
- It is!

209
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,707
- You fish?
- Not professionally.

210
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,748
You could call me
a frustrated amateur.

211
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:34,115
you're a frustrated amateur.
[Laughing]

212
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,316
- that's good.
- I was just kiddin'.
Just makin' a joke.

213
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,449
- It was a joke.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

214
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,824
What about you two?
you're professionals, right?

215
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,456
Well, I guess you could
say that, in a way.

216
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,365
we're semipro.
We won a lot of fishin' medals
and things like that.

217
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,835
- Not lately, though.
- Well, scout camp...

218
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,031
That counts, doesn't it?
Stuff like that.

219
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,440
- The reason I ask is... Sorry. Sorry.
- Oh.

220
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,513
- Do you mind if I join you?
- No, come on.

221
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,378
Thanks.

222
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,509
You see, my father was
a professional fisherman.

223
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,884
- [Joe] Really?
- He was telling me...

224
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,823
that he was working
on the deadly invader.

225
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,419
You know, I think
this might have been one
of his last original designs.

226
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,191
- By the way, I'm Joe.
- Oh, uh, Martin.

227
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,823
- How ya doin'?
- Martin Jeffries.

228
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,925
Gus. Yeah.

229
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,938
- Anyway, are you two married?
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

230
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,804
- Children?
- No, they're our age.

231
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,400
- No, I don't think
that's what he meant.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

232
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,945
- Do you have children?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

233
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,413
- They all get together.
- they're great kids, though.

234
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,713
- See, Fiona and I,
we never had children.
- Oh, geez.

235
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,847
When Fiona died,
I suddenly realized...

236
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,255
I' d wasted so much
of my life, you know?

237
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,419
- I' d spent 20 years behind a desk.
- that's a long time to sit.

238
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,827
- you're 100% right.
- Right, Joe?

239
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:57,062
- I was always jealous of men like you.
- Really?

240
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,469
Of course, I'm changing all that now,
you know. My life' s different.

241
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,567
Listen, I won' t hold you up.
Anyway, look, it was
a real honor meeting you.

242
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,202
- Hey, the pleasure' s ours.
- Yeah, thanks.

243
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,679
Thanks so much.
And good luck with the fishing.

244
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,183
- Yeah.
- Hey, try fishing.
You'll see.

245
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,685
- I'll give it a try.
- All right. he's a nice guy, huh?

246
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,713
Hey, what kind of accent
is that? Polish or somethin'?

247
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,089
- I think it's Irish.
- Yeah, Irish, Scottish.

248
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:25,495
Here. I'm glad y' all didn't buy
a bridge from that gentleman.

249
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,795
Why? He seemed
like a nice guy. He didn't
try to sell us anything.

250
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:32,827
- Seemed like a nice guy
havin' a tough time.
- Oh, really?

251
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,840
- Poor guy just recently
lost his wife, you know?
- Yeah.

252
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:39,035
Did you know you just recently
lost your car?

253
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,704
- there's a car just like mine!
- Joe, that's your car!

254
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,614
- It is! With my keys!
- [Tires Screeching]

255
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,916
- [Screaming]
- Hey, Joe!

256
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,998
Holy smokes!

257
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,667
[Woman]
it's simple.

258
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,602
When we find that guy
who stole my mom' s money
and broke her heart,

259
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,606
I'm gonna kill him.

260
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,373
- Food.
- What... What?

261
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,974
- Food.
- Oh, no. Come on.
We already lost two hours.

262
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,888
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

263
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,126
Okay.
What happened?

264
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,793
Oh, we just had ourselves
a little boatin' accident.

265
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,633
Some fella stole a car.

266
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,807
- Big mess.
- Oh, yeah?

267
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:47,504
He didn't happen to look
like this guy, did he?

268
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,247
Well, that was him.

269
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,151
- He was here!
- Well, when did he leave?

270
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,849
- A couple hours ago.
- Was he alone?

271
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,755
When he got here.

272
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,058
Then he sat over at that table
with a couple of fellas and...

273
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,691
they chit-chatted for a while
and... and he took their car.

274
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,567
Those guys whose car was stolen,
what about them?

275
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:17,665
Oh, you shouldn't have
any trouble findin' them. [Laughs]

276
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,506
[Laughs]

277
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,013
[Joe And Gus Panting]

278
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,990
My poor car, Gus.
My poor car.

279
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,688
My poor feet. Hey.

280
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:41,095
[Car Horn Honking]

281
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,397
[Boy In Car]
Hey, you dorks!

282
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,836
[Bird Squawking]

283
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,111
[Bird Squawking]

284
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,605
This trip ain't even a one.
it's a friggin' zero.

285
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,483
- It could be worse, Joe.
- How could it be worse?

286
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,147
You can't get any lower
than zero, right, Gus?

287
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,852
Hey, at least we're alive.
We almost got killed by our own boat.

288
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:11,659
My life stinks, Gus. But it stunk
a lot less when my car was in it.

289
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,665
- Yeah.
- That car meant a lot to me, Gus.

290
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,895
I got memories of that car
I can't even remember.

291
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,665
Yeah, but at least
we're goin' fishing.

292
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,798
Yeah.

293
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,308
- Hey, Joe?
- Yeah?

294
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,972
L-I was just thinkin;
Say, 100 years ago
we were goin' fishin;

295
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,676
- This is what we' d be doin'.
- What do you mean?

296
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,777
Yeah, think about it.
[Chuckles]

297
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,584
This is how we' d get
our boat to the water.

298
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:41,022
So we can't let that guy ruin
our Florida vacation, eh?

299
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,186
Hey, maybe you're right.

300
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:47,698
Yeah, and 1, 000 years ago,
we wouldn't even have paved roads.

301
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,896
Hey, that's right, Gus. It would be
filled with rocks and everything, right?

302
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,404
Y-Y-Yeah. And the boats
would be heavier.

303
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:58,909
that's right. We got
the latest technology wood.
This boat's light, right, Gus?

304
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,775
Yeah, and guess what, Joe?
A million years ago,

305
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:05,248
we wouldn't even have
wheels for our trailer. [Laughing]

306
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,444
We wouldn't even have
a friggin' trailer, right, Gus?

307
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,945
A-A-And Gus, if it was that long ago,
our brains would be smaller.

308
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,460
- We wouldn't even think
about anything like that.
- Oh, man, yeah.

309
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:19,453
- So, it may not be a ten yet,
- Yeah.

310
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,467
- But it definitely ain't a zero.
- [Horn Honking]

311
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,765
[Laughing]
Hey, hey!

312
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,771
- Hey, Gus, they're pulling over.
- Yeah.

313
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,275
- Hey.
- Hey, Gus.

314
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,280
- Yeah?
- Babes.

315
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,112
You guys need a ride?

316
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,516
Gus, what kind of knot
did you tie?

317
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,682
A double shambo
figure eight.

318
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:50,194
You went over, under, over.
Uh, the shambo goes over, under, under.

319
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:54,391
- Hey, Joe, trust me. it's over, under.
- it's under, under.

320
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,195
- Hi.

323
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,773

- We feel bad too, yeah.
- Yeah. Hmm.

325
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,041

' Cause the sheriff was out fishin'.

327
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,152
Y-You know the... You know your license

328
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,954

thatJoe does remember. [Laughs]

329
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,757

- Wait. Could you do that again?

331
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,801
- Maybe I'll bump into

- "5." I was five years old
the first time I tasted beer.
- Yeah.

336
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:44,975
And "42" was
Gus' s old football jersey before
he dislocated both his knees.

337
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,475
Yeah, but that's not
how I hurt my knees, you know.
I sleepwalk when I eat red meat.

338
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,819
- Sleepwalk?
- that's right. Hey, listen to this.

339
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,984
One time at a July 4th
barbecue we had...

340
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:59,530
After it was over,
Gus sleepwalked all the way over
to the 7-11 on the interstate.

341
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:03,090
Got wiped out by a motorcycle.
Almost killed him. Hey,
true story, I swear to God.

342
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,103
- it's a true story.
- Right, Gus?

343
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,104
- Yeah, right.

unpredictable, man.

Hey, you know somethin' else?
I think they find us attractive.

354
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,431
We have the license plate
number. We know that
it's a blue Barracuda.

355
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,130
And if we see this guy,
we're going to call the police.

356
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,230
- Of course, we're gonna call the police.
- Okay.

357

Oh, Joe! Your memory' s so bad.

- Oh, yeah! Killer looks!
- Yeah.

363
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,620
What we gotta do is figure out
what to do with these guys.

364
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:06,095

I was thinkin' of that low-down dir...

Uh, it was... It looked
more like a purse to me.

372
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,345
Yeah, yeah, he was a man
with a purse, yeah.

373
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,016
Oh, yeah, well, this guy
with the purse, did he maybe...

374
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,650

or something like that?

00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,308
so I can pull it out of the rod holder
when the fish is pulling hard.

429
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,316
Do you anchor
or do you drift?

along the break, if we can find one.

00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,665
Hey, Gus, check in there.
See if this guy touched anything.

477
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,759
- I'll kill him.
- Better not have touched our tapes.

478
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,804
Yeah, the tapes are in there too.
what's that?

479
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,602
- A knife.
- Holy smokes!

480
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,678
- Yeah.
- Hey, Gus, it looks like
it's got blood on it.

481
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,681
Sure does.
there's blood on it, Joe.

482
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,480
Hey, we could use it
to scale our fish.

483
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:43,281
Yeah, that's a good idea.
We'll use it to scale our fish.

484
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,721
[Joe] It feels good to get the car
back, Gus. I'll tell you that.

485
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,725
[Gus]
Smells good too.

486
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:51,193
Yeah.

487
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,493
Holy smokes!
Look at this place, Gus!

488
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,033
- Yeah, this must be it, Joe.
- Yeah.

489
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,593
But the sign says
"Rod & Gun Club,"Gus.

490
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,571
Oh. Glory Glades
must be a few miles away.

491
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,733
- Yeah, this ain't it, huh?
- Yeah.

492
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,869
- it's probably just as nice.
- I bet it's even nicer.

493
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:11,039
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

494
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:15,449
So far, Gus, l-I don't
like the landscaping, I'll tell ya that.

495
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,082
Yeah, somebody
ain't doin' their job, that's for sure.

496
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:22,024
This must be where the workers stay.
let's ask somebody.

497
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,220
Yeah, let's go ask.

498
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,250
Yeah, let's go ask.

499
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,758
Sure doesn't look
like a paradise, Joe.

500
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,264
[Belches]

501
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,102
Howdy there, folks.
Can I help y' all?

502
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,972
[Joe] Yeah, we're lookin'
for Glory Glades Lodge.

503
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,977
This here's it.

504
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,014
- This is it? [Muttering]
- No, no. Like here.

505
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,310
- Show him the coupon.
- See? Glory Glades.

506
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:49,683
- [Joe] That Glory Glades.
- Ah, the lodge!

507
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,985
We got two coupons
we won.

508
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:55,925
It was a beautiful lodge,
but she's gone now.

509
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,987
- Gone?
- Hurricane Andrew flattened it
flatter than flat.

510
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,590
Took us ten months
to clean this place up.

511
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,397
[Spittoon Dings,
Cat Screeches]

512
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,736
But not to worry. We got plenty of room.
Let me see that coupon again.

513
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,800
Oh, yeah, here.

514
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:16,803
Hmm. Well, y' all can stay
in one of them campers.

515
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,914
[Flies Buzzing]

516
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,318
We gotta stay in there?
Both of us?

517
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:28,121
Why, that's a big camper.
there's room for four or five,
and it's just the two of you.

518
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,821
- You ain't got no pets, have you?
- ain't you got nothin' else?

519
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:34,057
Oh, that's the top of the line.
I don't think you want what else we got.

520
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,930
- I guess we'll go check it out.
- Yeah.

521
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:40,131
that's the top of the line.
I just cleaned her out.

522
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,834
- [Bird Squawking]
- Hey, hey, give me that!

523
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,274
Friggin' slob.

524
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,744
I'll tell you what, Gus.
It doesn't look anything
like the picture.

525
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,750
Yeah, they should' ve sent us
a new brochure if they're gonna
change the picture like that.

526
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,447
- Yeah.
- Yeah, they got a lotta nerve
callin' this first prize.

527
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:00,490
- [Thunder Rumbling]
- I wonder what the losers got.
Six months in Sing Sing?

528
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,688
- Yeah, maybe.
- Careful. Why don't you go first?

529
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,491
There might be rats.
Go ahead, you're bigger.

530
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,125
- Me?
- Go ahead.

531
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,502
[Joe Shudders]

532
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,004
[Gus]
it's okay. Come on in, Joe.

533
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,100
[Alex Trebek Reading Clue]

534
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,735
- Richard?
- [Richard] Who was Dionysus?

535
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:24,314
- Correct.
- Holidays and Observances for 100.

536
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:29,011
In 1915, President Wilson
proclaimed this holiday
as the second Sunday in May.

537
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,111
Richard.

538
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,210
- What is Mother' s Day?
- Right.

539
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,224
Yeah, change it.

540
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,123
- it's a stupid show anyway.
- Yeah, I know.

541
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,353
[Joe] Hey, Country' s Criminals.
This is a good show.

542
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,022
- Yeah, I like this one.
- Yeah, you see some action stuffhere.

543
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:42,964
[Man On TV]
I love you so much, Gladys.
I could not live without you.

544
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,662
- Honestly.
- [Woman] Sure he could.

545
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,865
Gladys Sussner
is one of 43 women...

546
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,535
who this ruthless con artist
married and then stole from.

547
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,578
Wow, 43 ladies.

548
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,945
And it was Gladys
who was found dead with stab wounds.

549
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,576
This man
is the prime suspect.

550
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:02,813
- Hey, Gus, look who it is!
- Dekker Massey.

551
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,582
- it's the guy who stole my car!
- Yeah!

552
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:08,183
Dekker' s partner, his
educationally challenged
brother Quentin...

553
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,490
- This guy' s a killer,
and we didn't even know it.
- Was arrested...

554
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,791
but the police and
the federal authorities...

555
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:16,696
are still searching for Dekker Massey
and the murder weapon.

556
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,793
Hey, we got the evidence.

557
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,894
We don't have
any evidence, Joe.

558
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,405
- A $100, 000 reward...
- A $100, 000 reward!

559
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,534
For evidence linking

00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:28,305
- The knife in the car!
- The knife!
Yeah, with the blood on it.

561
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,904
- Yeah, with the blood on it.
- Maybe he used that
to stab that poor old lady.

562
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,917
- Yeah.
- Holy smokes, Gus!

563
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,647
And $5 million
in cash and jewelry,

564
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,622
believed to have been
hidden away by Dekker' s brother,
is still missing.

565
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,557
- Joe... we're gonna be rich, Joe!
- we're gonna be rich!

566
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:46,757
- If you can help us, please call today.

567
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:50,062
- Write the number down!

568
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:54,070
I don't believe it, Gus.
A hundred thousand dollars.
we're gonna be rich, Gus.

569
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,766
All we have to do is turn the knife in,
and we get the reward!

570
00:32:56,841 --> 00:33:00,709
Gus, you know what we'll do.
Tomorrow we buy a fishing boat
first and go fishin'!

571
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,804
- Yeah, we'll get a boat
just like our old one, Joe!
- Better! Better, Gus!

572
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:07,282
- Joe, this is easy.
- Oh, man, I can't believe it.

573
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:11,378
- No more worries, Gus.
- No more worries, Joe!

what's blank "shrugged."
Five letters, ending in an "S."

587
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,815
That' d be "Atlas,"
as in Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand,

a Russian-born
American writer.

589
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,478
Oh, yeah.

00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,490
Is the manager in?

591
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,492

Wonderful. Listen.

594
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,427
I was wondering if you're
still honoring these?

595
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:34,130
What the hell is it with these...
[Spits] damn coupons?

596
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,834
- Why, has somebody else
been in with one?
- Two fellas come in last night.

597
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,843
- They still here?
- No, they gone this mornin'.

598
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,312
Do you know where
They've gone?

599
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,747
They asked me where
they could buy a boat.

600
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,752
And did you
suggest a place?

601
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,687
- [Spittoon Dings]
- Yep.

602
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,358
Which place?

604
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:02,357
Oh, it's nice, Joe.
It has a kitchen.

605
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,868
You know, hey, Joe,

- See?
- Oh, that's nice, Joe.

610
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:18,280

We don't need that.
- Yeah, we don't need that.

611
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:21,283
The guys who can't fish get these.
they're show-offs.

612
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:24,479

- Why is it so expensive, Gus?

615
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,527
- Because we bought ours used
20 years ago.
- Yeah.

616
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:35,293
Yeah. Hey, Joe, maybe we
oughta just fish off the dock,

617
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,630
like we used to do
in the old days, yeah?

618
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:42,139
Look, I don't care.
You wanna just rent one?
We'll rent one.

619

Yeah, we can rent one.
Then we'll buy a real nice
used one when we get back home.

00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,290
- I wanna show you guys
somethin' different.
- All right.

635
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,087
- Something special.
- Yeah.

636
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,923
- Most of my customers
just shop the showroom.
- Yeah.

637
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,589
But I can see you guys
are professional fishermen.

638
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,791
I'm sure you can judge
this boat in the water.

639
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,597
- we're semipro, not professional.
- you've probably won some awards.

640
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,933
- Yeah, we won a few.
- Yeah. Oh, We've won a lot of' em.

641
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,507
Yeah, well, that's good.
Right here, guys.

642
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,510
- Hey, Gus, it's the Ranger 250C.
- Wow!

643
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,809
Yeah, the 250C. Let me tell you what's
sad about this boat.

644
00:36:56,914 --> 00:37:00,680
A lot of people look at this
and believe it's only a dream.

645
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,946
You fellas know
anyone like that?

646
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:05,683
- Yeah, us.
- But there's nothin'
wrong with lookin'.

647
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,849
Good point.

648
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:11,793
I cite this nudie photo
as a prime example.

649
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,558
- You men married?
- [Both] Yeah.

650
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,090
Then you'll understand me when
I say you're allowed to look.

651
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,363
- Yeah.
- That is the American way.

652
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,372
you're allowed all the eyeballing
your eyeballs can eyeball.

653
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:27,867
you'rejust not allowed to touch.
you're not allowed to play.

654
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:31,415
Well, I got good news
for you guys.

655
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:36,419
Go right ahead.
Touch. Play.

656
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,081
- Ex cuse me.
- Thanks a lot, Phil.

657
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,784
- Yeah.
- We might as well, Gus.
It can't hurt none, right?

658
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,987
Yeah, sure.
Oh, man!

659
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,792
- Wow, look at this. This is something.
- Man!

660
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:50,426
How about this guy? Tryin' to give us
the old salesman pitch.

661
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:54,597
With his nudie girl photo.
He never saw a girl
like that in his life.

662
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,299
- Yeah, yeah. He tried
to pull one on us.
- Yeah.

663
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,933
- Guys?
- [Both] Yeah?

664
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,241
Someone I want you to meet.
This is my assistant.

665
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:06,077
Julie, this is Gus and Joe.

666
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,550
- Hello, guys.
- [Both] Hi.

667
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,054
I'll sign those papers now.

668
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,648
Nice boat.
You guys look great in it.

669
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:17,354
- Thanks.
- I'm tellin' you, that baby' s cryin;

670
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,556
- Screamin'.
- Yeah.

671
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:22,464
- No, the boat.
- Yeah, that's what I was talkin' about.

672
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,367
Let me tell you something, guys.

673
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,404
[Clears Throat]

674
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:32,067
If I'm not honest with you,
I'm not lyin' to anyone.

675
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:35,577
I started this business
because I'm a fisherman
and a boatman,

676
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:39,174
not because my time equals sales
plus commission minus overhead.

677
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,684
To me, it's
the people that matter.

678
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:44,084
- Yeah, people.
- Yeah. People, yeah.

679
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,181
I wouldn't want you
to fall in love with...
just for example...

680
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,885
A boat like mine.
that's the Waveliner II.

681
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,622
She' d be overkill
for you fellas.

682
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,393
- Yeah, overkill. Too much.
- Yeah, overkill.

683
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,798
The truth is, this boat you're
standin' in, the Ranger 250C...

684
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:02,033
Gentlemen, this boat...

685
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,233
Well... can you
just see the neighbors?

686
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,538
- Yeah, the neighbors.
- The neighbors.

687
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,739
- Wazinski. [Laughing]
- Yeah.

688
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,045
Can you just see them?
I'm tellin' you, that's
the best part of my job.

689
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:16,850
Not keepin' boats afloat,
but keepin' a man' s self-image
above the water.

690
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,252
- Yeah, self-image.
- Self-image, yeah.

691
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:23,555
Y-You see, Phil, we were thinkin' about
buyin' the, uh, Little Guy?

692
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,687
- Yeah. it's too, um...
- But it's too, uh...

693
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:29,062
- Cheap?
- [Both] Yeah, cheap.

694
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,194
- Where do you fellas fish?
- Glory Glades.

695
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,362
Fellas, are you familiar
with the phrase...

696
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,770
"No one fishes Glory Glades"?

697
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,774
- No.
- I never heard that.

698
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,276
Guys, if you learn
anything from me today,

699
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,372
remember the two words...
Tigertail Lagoon.

700
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,077
- Hey, that's where Bubba and J. P...
- J. P., yeah.

701
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,618
- We got a couple of friends
of ours fish over there.
- Yeah, yeah.

702
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,918
it's where I fish.
Here, have a pen.

703
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,390
- Hey.
- Hey.

704
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,222
Yeah.

705
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:01,890
- Phil, would you sign this for me?
- Oh, yeah. Gladly.

706
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,102
Are you guys okay?

707
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,104
- Fine, thanks.
- Yeah, fine.

708
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:10,298
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you, Julie.

709
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:16,005
Thank you, Julie. Uh, Phil, you know,
there's no way we can afford...

710
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:20,709
Gus, prices are relative to your outlook
and how you approach a matter.

711
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:24,517
- For example, I say ten dollars.
- Yeah.

712
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:28,023
You say two. that's eight dollars
worth of play, my friends.

713
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:30,026
- Yeah, it's eight dollars.
- Yeah.

714
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,324
Can we not disagree
on somethin'?

715
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,423
- We can't... We can't disagree.
- No.

716
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:38,867
I think we reached that
place already, minutes ago.
Now here's my point.

717
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,234
- And you can take this to the bank.
- Yeah.

718
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:44,739
Think for a moment
of the words "easy payments."

719
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,140
- Easy payments.
- Easy payments.

720
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:52,673
I'm talkin' 810 easy payments...
they're easy now... of $39.95.

721
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,150
- $39.95. that's not bad.
- No.

722
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:59,748
Each. that's $39.95.
This boat, your boat.

723
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,291
Think about it.

724
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:05,988
All we need is a signature,
and you've already got a pen.

725
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:09,497
- Yeah.
- Ex cuse me.

726
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:15,305
What do you think?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

727
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,637
- Yeah. It depends
on what you're thinkin'.
- Yeah, well...

728
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:22,702
P.S. there's a 30-day
money-back guarantee.

729
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:26,146
So it's a test-drive.
You don't like it...
which you will...

730
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,617
you call, we come,
we pick it up.

731
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,017
End of story,
see you next time, no questions asked.

732
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,114
- that's like free rent, Gus.
- Yeah.

733
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:36,557
You guys, if you need anything...
I mean anything...

734
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,721
just say out loud
the word "Phil"!

735
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:42,732
- [Chuckles]
- Ex cuse me.

736
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,671
- Hey, Phil!
- Hey, Phil!

737
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,731
Hey, Gus, did you ever think
we' d own a boat like this?

738
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,369
Oh, man, no.
Look at the navigation, Joe.

739
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,538
- Yeah. what's this?
- that's the three-dimensional sonar.

740
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,913
- Hey, Gus, I know we gotta
bring back the knife.
- Yeah.

741
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,920
But do you think we could
get a little O. F. H. In first?

742
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,389
Yeah, we do a little O. F. H.,
and then we take the knife back.

743
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,722
- [Sonar Beeping]
- Hey, Gus, look at this!

744
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:13,786
- A hundred yards north of here.
Look at all that fish activity!
- Wow!

745
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:17,299
Hey, Joe,
they all around us, man! [Laughs]

746
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:21,303
- Hey, we're surrounded by fish.
- Hey, we made it, Joe!

747
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:26,138
Hey, you know what, Gus?
This is the first time on
this trip that life is good.

748
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,508
- Hey, a ten.
- A ten plus.

749
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,209
[Together]
Borderline 11!

750
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:35,012
[Both Laughing]

751
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,644
I can't wait to try out
the new "flick dip," you know?

752
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,814
- Flick, dip.
- [Gus Grunting]

753
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,453
[Screaming]

754
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:49,324
[Screaming]

755
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:52,927
- What happened, Gus?
- You knocked me over with the flick.

756
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,971
- Gus!
- Oh, no!

757
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,774
- [Sonar Beeping]
- Joe, look at the fish
activity here! Whoo!

758
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:09,676
- [Screaming]
- Hey, what-what-what?

759
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,588
- Look! Gus!
- [Screaming Continues]

760
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:16,182
- Let go of the pole!
- Hey, it broke!

761
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,990
Get off! Get off!

762
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,792
[Gus]
what's it say, Joe? what's it say?

763
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:24,130
- I can't find it. Ignition. Ignition.
- Huh?

764
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,897
[Man In Small Boat]
Shut it down!

765
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:30,200
- [Screaming]
- [Both] Sorry.

766
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,834
Slow down!
Shut it off!

767
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,107
- Let me have it.
- it's broke! it's broke!

768
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,512
Try shuttin' the key off, Gus.

769
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,813
- Shut the what off again?
- Shut the key off!

770
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,149
- You broke it.
- Yeah, it broke. [Screams]

771
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:48,716
Sorry!
Oh, I feel bad, Gus.

772
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,556
Move out of the way!
Move out of the way!

773
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,325
- Sorry.
- Hey, Joe, where are we goin'?

774
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:57,161
- Hey, J... J. P!
- Hey, it's J. P! Bubba!

775
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,967
- Oh, Joe!
- Oh, Gus!

776
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:05,203
- Joe, get in! Get in!
- Gus! Gus!

777
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,883
Joe, the knife! Get the knife!
Get it, Joe. Get it!

778
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,319
- Gus! Oh!
- Get it!

779
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:23,087
- I can't get it.
- Come on, Joe. You get it?

780
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:26,492
- Did you get it, Joe?
- No, I can't get it, Gus.

781
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,693
You couldn't get it, Joe?
Ohhh!

782
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,293
Gus, what are we gonna do?
We don't...

783
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,533
- I don't know, Joe.
- I can't believe it. I can't
believe we lost that knife.

784
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:38,302
- Me either. I can't believe it.
- That was everything to us.

785
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,708
- Everything.
- I know. Oh, we in big trouble, Joe.

786
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,712
[Man]
Hey, there they are!

787
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,714
- Gus!
- let's move!

788
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,716
Slow down!
Where are you goin'?

789
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,549
- Why are they chasin' us?
- I don't know why.

790
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,815
Look like they're
gainin' on us, Joe!

791
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:56,916
Get outta here! it's not our fault!
It broke! The thing broke!

792
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:00,360
Leave us alone!
We got enough problems!

793
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:03,366
- Watch those bushes, Gus!
- [Screaming]

794
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,959
[Screaming Continues]

795
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,268
Watch out!

796
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,366
[Screaming Continues]

797
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,705
that's my boat!

798
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,781
[Both Panting]

799
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,426
- Hey, Phil!
- Hey, Phil!

800
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,594
Hey, Phil, we decided
to bring the boat back
before the 30 days was up.

801
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:43,195
- Right, Joe?
- Yeah. Look, Phil,
this stuff all broke.

802
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,209
You better get it all fix ed.
Thanks, anyway.

803
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,905
Yeah, thanks, man.
You know, you need better material.

804
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,310
Yeah. Sorry.

805
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,714
[Screaming]

806
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,651
These guys are
a two-man disaster area.

807
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:02,851
They just bought a boat and destroyed it
in less than an hour.

808
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:07,953
Look, these idiots
won' t get very far.

809
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:10,364
Now They've got my map.

810
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,061
It might take me
another day to find them.

811
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,867
But I will find them.
don't worry.

812
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:19,704
And when I'm finished with them,
I'll know where the money is.

813
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:24,306
we're gonna be working
every weekend for the rest
of our lives, Gus.

814
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,372
How come?

815
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:29,577
Because that boat cost
more than our house.

816
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,624
At least we'll
be home on time.

817
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,695
Wrong.
we're gonna be home a day earlier,

818
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,424
and that's worse than
gettin' there on time.

819
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:46,094
Besides, that friggin' knife
is somewhere at the bottom
ofTigertail Lagoon.

820
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:50,405
- In any case, we're goin' home.
- [Tire Blows Out]

821
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,505
- Flat.
- Flat.

822
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:57,742
I got it, Gus.

823
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:01,148
[Dog Barking]

824
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:04,245
- Hey, Gus.
- What?

825
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:07,653
- what's this?
- what's what, Joe?

826
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:11,387
Look, look. It looks like
a map of somethin'.

827
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:17,500
Joe, it's a map
to the money andjewels.

828
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:20,366
What jewels and money?

829
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,064
Joe, your memory' s so bad.

830
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,301
Remember the $2-1/2 million
in stolen jewels and money...

831
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,401
the guy on TV
said was hidden away?

832
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:31,072
- This is it?
- Yeah. Who cares about the knife?

833
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:35,813
We get the reward anyway.
Hey, w-we got a map
to $2-1/2 million dollars!

834
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:39,082
- Hey, we're gonna
get the reward anyway!
- we're gonna be rich!

835
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:43,091
- we're gonna be rich...
- [Muttering] Wait, wait, wait, wait!

836
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:46,789
- Gus, Gus, Gus, listen!
Gus, Gus! Listen.
- Huh? Yeah.

837
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,697
Listen. Who cares
about the reward is right.

838
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:53,225
Forget about the reward. let's
just take the 2-1/2 million
in money and jewels.

839
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:56,204
we're millionaires!
Millionaires, Gus! we're rich!

840
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:59,537
Joe, that guy stole that
from 43 women.

841
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,443
that's a whole lot
of broken hearts.

842
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:08,651
Yeah, i-i-it's not nice.
We wouldn't like it if it
was somebody in our families.

843
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,845
- We can't take it.
- But think, Joe.

844
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:15,550
Not only is it a lot of women...
That means a lot of rewards.

845
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:17,854
it's a lot of rewards!

846
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:21,397
- it's more than one reward.
we're rich! we're rich!
- we're gonna be rich.

847
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,865
- we're gonna be rich.
- we're rich. that's right.

848
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:26,868
Instead of one reward,
we get a bunch of rewards.

849
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:30,667
- we're really rich now.
And we're picking up...

about this, you know?

1101
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:05,333
What do you mean, intelligent?
you're being silly, man.
Nothing' s gonna happen!

1102
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:08,366
What do you mean, intelligent?
you're being silly, man.
Nothing' s gonna happen!

1103
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,903
Hey, Gus, it hurts
to get hit by lightning. You
don't know what it feels like.

1104
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:14,074
Hey, Joe, watch. Uh, look.

1105
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:18,779
Hey... hit me!
See?

1106
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:23,291
Hit me! You see?
[Laughing]

1107
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:26,225
Right here. See?

1108
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:28,889
See what I mean?
Hey, here I am!

1109
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:32,991
You got a free shot!
Take it! Right here! Hit me!

1110
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:35,900
See wha...
See what I mean, Joe?

1111
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:38,202
Yeah, it's a little silly.

1112
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:40,798
Here, here, here.
let's go fix the car.

1113
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,708
There. See?

1114
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:46,544
[Laughing]

1115
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:50,251
Here.

1116
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:52,753
Whoo. Whoo!

1117
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:56,258
Uh-huh.
[Laughing]

1118
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:03,563
[Thunderclap]

1119
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,396
- [Screams]
- Hey, Joe!

1120
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:14,209
Joe! Joe?
Joe, talk to me. Joe, talk to me.

1121
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:18,270
Joe, l-I didn't mean
to talk you into doin' it, Joe.

1122
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:22,182
I should' ve listened to you!
I said nothing' s gonna happen,
and it happened.

1123
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:27,689
[Crying] A-A-All the little guy
wanted to do was go fishin'.

1124
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:31,920
Is that askin' too much?

1125
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:34,326
Oh, he's a...
he's a good guy.

1126
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:37,389
I mean, he's a good guy.
The best.

1127
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,095
Joe, we all love ya.

1128
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,406
[Muttering, Whimpering]

1129
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:53,815
Joe, Joe, Joe.

1130
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:57,410
Hey, Gus,
I remember the map.

1131
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,454
[Joe]
Snickerson's Airboat Rentals.

1132
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:02,251
Left, right, right,
left, left, right, right.

1133
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:06,590
Channel number 27,
11 paces to the big tree
underneath the water nest.

1134
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:09,654
that's where the treasure lies,
where Mad Maggie rests.

1135
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:12,700
- Hey, we're gonna be rich!
- we're gonna be rich!

1136
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:15,896
[Both Continue]
we're gonna be rich.
we're gonna be rich.

1137
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:26,075
He was not there, and
they don't want to talk to me.

1138
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:29,380
- What happened here?
- A fire.

1139
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,976
I can see it was a fire.
How did it start?

1140
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:36,184
- Two guys from up north
blew up their room.
- You don't say?

1141
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:40,194
One tall, one short,
in a blue car?

1142
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:44,790
Yes. Yeah. I, uh...

1143
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:50,431
I wait on the tables
for the tall and the small one.

1144
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:53,339
They say
where they were going?

1145
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:58,039
The tall one,
he come to me and he said...

1146
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:00,878
He showed me a map,

1147
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:04,044
and he want to know
where was Snickerson's.

1148
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:06,383
- Airboats. Gotcha.
- So l... So l...

1149
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,588
If you see them,
you tell them...

1150
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,788
that I love them very much
and I want to see them again...

1151
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:18,800
- and that they're very nice,
very attractive boys.
- [Shutter Clicks]

1152
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,967
[Gus]
You sure we're going the right way?

1153
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:26,964
Yeah, there's the arch, Gus.
We gotta go under that arch
and turn right, Gus.

1154
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:30,570
- We should be able to see the
island once we get past this.
- Oh, yeah?

1155
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:34,379
- what's the next landmark?
- We gotta go right,
and then there's twin trees.

1156
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,075
I can't wait
to get there.

1157
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:37,880
- Sure scary in here, Gus.
- Yeah.

1158
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:41,081
- what's that?
that's a log over there?
- that's only a log.

1159
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:45,388
- Oh, okay. Here.
- it's only a log.

1160
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,520
- We goin' through the arch?
- Go through this arch, then go right.

1161
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:51,532
Straight through there, Gus.
that's it!

1162
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,330
- Straight, Gus.
- we're on our way, Joe.

1163
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:57,236
it's a lot of work,
but it's gonna be worth it, Gus.

1164
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,536
I-it's the palm tree
with nothin' on it.

1165
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:03,135
We make a left here
and then there's a tree
with a flower on it, Gus.

1166
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:07,181
that's it. Hey, look!
there's a tree with a flower
on it. that's it.

1167
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,274
- that's a pretty flower.
- that's it.

1168
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:13,344
And there's the cave, Gus.
It just said watch out for Mad Maggie.

1169
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,357
Who's Mad Maggie?

1170
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:19,054
It was just something
on the map, probably
to keep people away.

1171
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:23,464
Mad Maggie.
Keep them away, yeah.

1172
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:26,832
- Come on, Gus.
- All right.

1173
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,600
we're gonna be rich.

1174
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:36,773
that's the cave, huh?

1175
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:38,609
- that's it, Gus.
- Yeah.

1176
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:41,980
- I remembered everything.
I can't believe it.
- Well, this is the cave.

1177
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:45,475
- The cave is inside.
This is the hole, though.
- This is the hole, that's right.

1178
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:49,082
- Yeah. it's kind of dark
in there, Joe.
- I got a light for you, Gus.

1179
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:52,490
- For me?
- Well, I figured you
should go in first, Gus.

1180
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:55,587
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Because I know I can fit in this hole,

1181
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:58,531
- but we want to make sure
you get in here.
- Yeah, that's right.

1182
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:01,434
- Right?
- you're not scared, are you, Joe?

1183
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:04,734
- No. Hey, Gus, I'll go.
- Oh, no, that's all right.
I know you're not.

1184
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:06,741
-' Cause I'm not scared, Gus.
- Okay. You just watch out.

1185
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:08,538
- I just want to get the money.
- Yeah, okay.

1186
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,839
- All right?
- The jewels are right in there.

1187
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:13,437
- I wonder what this
Mad Maggie stuff is about.
- What?

1188
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,450
Nothing, nothing. Okay.

1189
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:18,544
- Easy now.
- Here it... How' s that, Gus?

1190
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,554
Yeah.

1191
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,493
[Gus] it's hard to see.
Joe, over here in front of me.

1192
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:31,897
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, my eyesight gets bad
when I get in close places.

1193
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:37,603
- What you see?
- I don't see nothing, Gus.

1194
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:40,665
- It stinks in here, doesn't it?
- It ain't me.

1195
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:43,176
It smells
like rotten meat.

1196
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,274
Hey, Gus. there's
something back there, Gus.

1197
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,579
- Look at this. See that?
- Yeah, I see it.

1198
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,915
- L-it's a case.
- Yeah.

1199
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:54,581
This is it.
Hold this, Gus.

1200
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,181
[Muttering]
You got it?

1201
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:59,694
- Oh, be careful.
- I got it.

1202
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:02,526
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1203
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:13,201
- Holy smokes!
- that's it, Joe!

1204
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:16,506
- Holy smokes!
Hey, we're gonna be rich, Gus.
- Yeah.

1205
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:19,139
- We get 100, 000, right?
- We get $100, 000,Joe.

1206
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,241
let's get it outta here.

1207
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:25,616
- We did it, Gus. We did it.
- [Hissing]

1208
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:29,157
- What are you shushing me for?
- I didn't shush you, Joe.
Come on. let's go.

1209
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,726
- You didn't shush me?
- No, I didn't shush you.

1210
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:34,352

01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:51,137
Watch it, Gus! Gus!
What the heck are you doin'?

1215
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:53,478
I can get it, Joe.
I can get it.

1216
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:56,643
- Gus, what are you doing?
Are you crazy?
- H-Hey, pull!

1217
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,913
Get it out!
Pull harder, Joe!

1218
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:01,488

[Screams, Grunts]
I got it, Joe!

1220
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:08,029
[Grunting]
What do I do now, Joe?

1221
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,588
Hey, Gus, be careful!
Let it go.

1222
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,726
Spin him around, Gus.
I'll kick him in the nuts.

1223
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:16,100
he's a she, Joe.
She ain't got no nuts.

1224
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:20,700
Get her, Joe, get her!
Harder, harder, Joe, harder!

1225
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:23,735

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1229
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:35,948
You know, Gus, there's a lot
of family heirlooms here.

1230
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,959
Those poor people.
that's not nice.

1231

- Yeah, a lot of"hairlooms"

- Yeah.

1232
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:42,129
W-we're gonna get

1233
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:43,858
- we're gonna be rich.
- Yeah, and famous.

1234
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,957

- Move!
- Okay, I'm movin'. I'm movin'.

1237
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:54,169
[Gus]
I'm moving.

1238
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:56,438
- what's he doing, Joe?
- I don't know, Gus.

1239
01:11:56,545 --> 01:12:01,073
Rugby-playing jerk.
I' d like to get him on a football team.

1240
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:05,278
- Now push.
- What? What?

1241
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:09,290
- Just push the car!
- Hey!

1242
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:14,092
I've wasted a lot of time
looking for you two.
Now, you do what I say.

1243
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:17,792
Gus, it's all right, Gus.
it's all right. don't...
don't get in trouble, Gus.

1244
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:20,300
- Bet he can't play no football.
- Push the car!

1245
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,327
- I just can't.
- Push the car!

1246
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:26,033
- He said he's gonna push!
- Do you want me to put
a bullet through his head?

1247
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:28,099
- No, he's gonna push.
- Do it now.

1248
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,905
- Push, Joe.
- Gus, I can't.

1249
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,502
- I know.
- He scared me.

1250
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:34,707
I know, Joe.
it's tough, man. it's tough.

1251
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:37,149
- Oh, Gus.

You two wouldn't understand.
I really deserve that money.

01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:18,182
I made those women feel
like somebody really
loved them, you know?

1256

Believe me, it wasn't easy.
I deserve every penny.

1257

So you just sit there...

1258
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:32,403
and think about me
going off to a life
of wealth and luxury...

while you've only got your
dreary little poverty-stricken
lives to go back to.

But I'm sure you'll enjoy
spending Thanksgiving
here together.

You want to fight everybody.

1269
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:10,177
Why don't you join the army
if you want to fight?

Gojoin the Marines,
fiight with them.
See how tough you are.

- You know, for an insignificant,
ignorant little man...

1281
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:49,617
you've got
a really big mouth.

1282
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:51,811
Now shut it.

1283
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,013
You all right, Joe?

really grow up. you've got
children of your own, you know?

1288

Now that is
a really scary thought.

1289
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:26,486
I could kill you now,
