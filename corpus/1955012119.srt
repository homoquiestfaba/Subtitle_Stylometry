00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,159
Being a grandfather, or a father, now
that's harder than being the Grand Canyon.

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,760
It's just a hole, sitting
there, doing nothing.

TOBY: <i>Okay, but are you even okay without
havin' a Grand Canyon?</i>

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,280
Or should we just kick some sand up all
over it, and fill it up like a cat box?

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Shit.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,879
All I'm sayin' is the Grand Canyon is

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,794
where Joe was left that very day.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,793
Yo, Ebony, Ivory? You
talkin' about Joe Dirt?

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,190
- Yeah.
- I know a little something about Joe Dirt.

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,158
Stopped into an old radio station I worked
a few years back.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,039
Stayed for, it must have been a week.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,353
Wove some bat-shit crazy tale.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,349
So bat-shit, he should have hung upside down
from the ceiling when he was telling it.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,911
I remember a big kid, bigger heart.

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,597
Sure, you know, I'm not saying the IQ
wasn't subterranean.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,191
I mean, that intellect was barely
skimming the treetops.

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,675
Now, I ain't saying that I ain't
in "agree-ence" with you.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,517
But somewhere in there,
the speechifying you making,

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,080
it just ain't sounded right.

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,356
Hey, John C-minus Reilly.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,720
It's not "agree-ence", it's "agreematude".

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,679
And by the way, what's with the mouth
for God's sakes?

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,550
The teeth look like a half-completed
Lego project.

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,831
What are you gargling with, M-80s?

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,516
Are those deciduous teeth? I'm waiting
for them to change color, fall out

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,560
and float down to the Grand. Who's your
orthodontist, Moe Howard with

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,074
a ball-peen hammer?

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,279
I mean, for God's sakes, man. It looks like
Willie Stargell took a bat to your mouth.

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,793
Now listen, JD has got himself in
another bind here.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,193
But, why not let the boy tell ya
his own tale, in his own way?

over, over there, yeah. I tidy up after.

60
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,276
- Tidy up?
- Dirty, yeah. I'm sort of, you know, a roadie.

61
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,793
Oh, you travel with the bands, and you
pack up their equipment after concerts

62
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,318
- and their amplifiers and stuff?
- Oh, yeah, exactly. But, no, not per se.

63
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,235
I don't travel with them.
Uh, mostly I mop up after they're done.

64
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,391
Like, I clean up the poop and the barf
and things. And your occasional fart items.

And peepee, you know, whatnot.

66
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,317
So, you don't actually travel with them,
and such. Not a roadie.

67

No, exactly. I don't know where
that started, yeah.

- Now we're on the same page.
- Why aren't you in there,

69

- watching them perform?
- Oh, uh, well,

70
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,434
I ain't exactly allowed in the building
during the concerto, if you will.

71
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,072
But, if there is a diarrhea emergency or
something, I get to go in and clean it up.

So there are some perks.

picking up their garbage and bodily fluids,

- No, that's a good one. You got me.

don't sound like one.

Not quite, termite.

486
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,999
- Give us those boots.
- I'm running away. Good luck catching me.

487
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,395
Which way am I going?

488
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Get back here!

489
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,960
You ain't man enough to wear those boots.
You know that, Joe Dirt.

490
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,515
You ain't nothing.
You know that in your heart.

491
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,196
We will track you to the gates of hell.

492
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,956
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

493
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,240
Stupid Foggle.

494
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,274
What a dumb name. He needs a cool name,
like Joe Dirtay.

495
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,158
Hey, Foggle.

496
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,360
Why don't you go play Boggle?

497
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,633
God dang, that's so funny,
why didn't I say it?

498
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,515
I think of all the good ones too late.

499
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,752
Well, I got my tennis shoes,
and his stupid boots! Whoo-hoo!

500
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,434
Well, I don't need these sneakers no more.

501
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,998
Whoo-pee! Ha-ha!

502
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,510
Fetch that, Boggle!

503
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,634
Man, it usually takes me 27 times. Nice.

504
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,836
Hey, how come ya threw your sneakers up
over that power line?

505
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,114
- Why? You've never seen that before?
- No, silly head!

506
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,240
Silly head, 1965.

507
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,877
I must've traveled through some sort of
vortex and tumbled through time,

508
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
like a time traveler.

509
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,036
I don't know what's happening.

510
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,790
But I'll tell ya, that
happens in the future.

511
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,954
We find out carbs are bad for ya,
just a heads up.

512
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,874
Hey. You really from the future?

513
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
Yeah, man.

514
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,672
Maybe you should move down to Louisiana,
help me start my fishing business!

515
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,430
You and I together, man,
we could catch a lot of shrimp!

516
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,557
I mean, there's rock shrimp, Atlantic shrimp,
salt shrimp, boo-boo shrimp, tater shrimp,

517
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,350
shrimp on a stick, shrimp remoulade, shrimp
in your pasta, you know what, fuck shrimp!

518
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,320
Okay, so, no on the shrimp biz?

519
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,471
What's the situation with your hair?

520
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,869
Did I call your number?

521
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,550
Are we in a deli?

522
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,076
We are not. And I did not. Goodbye.

523
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,952
Did you call number three yet?

524
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,591
Did I call number... No, that was a
metaphor, this ain't really a bakery, man.

525
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,435
Yeah, I know.
I was just patiently waiting my turn.

526
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,075
You see that?
He's patiently waiting his turn, all right?

527
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,596
That's nice, instead of
yelling out nonsense.

528
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,076
Yeah, one day I'm gonna dig a hole.

529
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,150
Well, that's great, man.

530
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,990
See, there you go.
You're gonna have a great, big hole.

531
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,470
It's gonna be the biggest one,
and I'm glad you're setting goals.

532
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,433
It's gonna be in my living room.

533
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,876
Yeah, well, you had me,
then you lost me there.

534
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,551
- Are you married?
- I am married. Now, that's a normal question.

535
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,360
- I'm married to Brandy. She's sweet.
- Wait a minute.

536
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,877
Is she like a great big fat person?

537
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,480
A great big fat person? She is not.
She's about 115, I'm guessing.

538
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,515
I really wish those numbers
were turned around.

539
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,440
Like 511?

540
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,394
Well, then she'd be a great big fat person.

541
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:15,557
Uh, yeah, no, I like her 115. Anything over,
like, 400 I'm not super attracted to.

542
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,279
I'd like to cut her skin off,

543
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,749
and then sew it together, so that
I could wear it as a human tracksuit.

544
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,629
Mmm.

545
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,319
Maybe I'm hearing you wrong, it sounds a
little, um, not normal, what you're saying?

546
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
My name's Bob.

547
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,635
Uh, if I had any friends,
they'd call me Buffalo Bob.

548
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,270
Why don't you give me a call if your wife
ever becomes a great big fat person?

549
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,234
Buffalo Bob, that sounds... (GASPS)

550
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,634
You have no idea what kind of hell
I can bring you!

551
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,392
Oh, all right, enough, you broken record!

552
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,834
Does what it's told!

553
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,674
Say it, don't spray it, brother! Dang.

554
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Buffalo Bob!

555
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
Oh, man!

556
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,678
Was that all in my living room?

557
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,120
'Cause that's step one.

558
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,559
Uh, gotta run. There's a huge crazy party
behind that shed.

559
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,672
You can go, there's three tickets left.

560
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,080
What are you up to?

561
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,000
JOE: "Genghis Khan."

562
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,670
Genghis Khan what?

563
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,879
It's a comic book store?

564
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,198
Oh, if I'm back in time,
I could maybe buy...

565
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,789
<i>Looking fine as she could be</i>

566
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
Is that Brandy?

567
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Brandy!

568
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,512
<i>Well, she was a-walkin down the street</i>

569
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,991
<i>Looking fine as she could be</i>

570
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,194
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

571
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,234
<i>If you have love and conversation</i>

572
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,160
<i>Whoa, yeah, what I say!</i>

573
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,880
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

574
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,234
Like a beaut.

575
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,030
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

576
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,200
MAN: You got that $5 you owe me?

577
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,917
See, I was thinking, you know,
since we're both seniors now,

578
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,277
maybe it's time we, uh, you know...

579
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,552
Um, wait a second. I think I see Jill.

580
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,392
I've gotta go talk to her.
She needs help with her homework.

581
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
All right.

582
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,039
Homework is important.
I'll be here, waiting.

583
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,280
Like always.

584
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,318
Wow. That was a total red light.

585
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,116
She gave you nothing but brake fluid.
You're smothered in it.

586
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,590
So funny I forgot to laugh.

587
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,320
Guess it's time to try the old
"Popcorn Surprise."

588
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
What's a "Popcorn Surprise"?

589
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,836
JIMMY: Listen up, here's the skinny.

590
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,594
See, I put a hole through the bottom of
a large tub of popcorn.

591
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,960
Does the popcorn fall out?

592
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,399
I don't know, it doesn't matter, all right?

593
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,670
After I cut the hole through,
I put my thingy up through the hole.

594
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,429
Wait, hold on now, fella, you lost me.
What's a thingy?

595
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,034
Get smart and get smart fast!

596
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,153
That thing you use to go number one?

597
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,593
Oh, so that's what keeps the popcorn
from falling out.

598
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,680
Makes sense.

599
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,194
I guess so, but that's not the point.

600
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,633
All right? Anyways, after I get my thingy
stuck up through the hole,

601
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,159
she reaches to grab the popcorn,
presto! Handful of thingy!

602
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,599
- Oh, that's cool.
- Spread the word around.

603
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,277
- It's gonna be classic.
- Yeah, all right, all right!

604
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
Go, go, go!

605
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,917
So, he finally made his move on you?

606
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:45,236
Yeah, he's sweet, but I don't have
those kind of feelings for him.

607
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,831
Oh, you need to check
your temperature, girl,

608
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,310
because he's the most
dreamiest boy in school.

609
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,878
Brandy, hey, whoo, sorry.
I just ran five miles chasing you!

610
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,560
What are you doing here?

611
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,552
What are you wearing? That looks funny.

612
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,515
I'm sorry, do I know you?

613
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,835
- Brandy!
- And my name isn't Brandy.

614
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
I'm Ashleen.

615
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,754
Well, if it's 1965 and you're Ashleen...

616
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,550
Yeah, it's 1965, strange-o.
What about it, you freaky guy?

617
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,670
Oh, my God, are you Brandy's mom?

618
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,120
(CHUCKLES)

619
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,555
I don't know what you're sayin',
but I have always liked the name Brandy.

620
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,952
I could see me namin' a daughter that.

621
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,351
Yeah, you can, 'cause you...

622
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,517
Why are you talkin' to our girls, and
what's the deal with your hair, you weirdo?

623
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,159
Yeah, show him your muscles, fellas.

624
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,112
Maybe he'll scram. And scram fast.

625
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,040
Check this out.

626
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,640
Do you even lift?

627
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,040
(SIGHS)

628
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
(YAWNS)

629
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,356
Listen, I better go, because these guys are
getting a little cranky.

630
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,350
All right? So listen, Ashleen,
I think I came here to the past

631
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,234
to fix something about myself, you know?

632
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,472
So, I deserve the daughter
that you're gonna have one day.

633
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,552
- I don't know what you mean.
- I don't know either.

634
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,919
And by the way, do not eat
Jimmy's popcorn, okay?

635
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,195
"Jimmy"? Oh, no, his name is Rory.

636
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Rory Yauch.

637
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,109
Oh, Fudge! That's Jimmy's dad! Oh, man,
this shit just got officially weird.

638
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,079
Hey, you watch your language,
buddy boy fella!

639
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,829
You want a big bar of soap in your mouth?

640
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
JOE: Hey, are you a vet?

641
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,439
'Cause these puppies are sick, huh.

642
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,436
Yeah, you like that one? Talk to the fist,
'cause the hand is pissed.

643
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,439
Oh, those are from the future!
You just got futurized.

644
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,115
You got a burn, and it came down from
the future and got you.

645
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,950
You're a little dazed right now, it'll go
away. But don't fight it, just... Shh.

646
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,318
Hey, he's gonna give you
the "Popcorn Surprise."

647
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,394
What's a "Popcorn Surprise"?

648
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,036
I'll give you a hint, it's more surprise
than popcorn, okay?

649
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,271
Just promise me you don't put your hand

all right?

Hey, Foggle.

693
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,833
Now see, when I ride with a man like this
guy, I got a nice thick phonebook between us.

694
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,752
Like this thing right here.

695
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,116
That way we're not really
touching each other.

696
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,120
Right.

697
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,671
Now, Joe here, if he were to
ride behind a man,

698
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,911
he probably wouldn't have a phonebook
dividing him from the other man.

699
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,952
No, no, no. He would say, "No,
I don't need no phonebook in between us,

700
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,952
"because I'd rather be nice and cozy."

Or if he puts something in between him
and the other man,

703
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,631
he would want it to be a little
bit thinner, like a magazine.

704
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,631
Or like a menu.

705
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,512
- A really thin menu.
- Like a Kleenex.

706
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,960
You wish you'd thought of Kleenex.

to wear those boots.

- You give 'em to me, boy.
- No.

and rubbed 'em on my private parts?

rocks over there instead of using this trail?

- What year is it?
- It's 1977, bigfoot.

drunk. It was like 28, but I brag and say 30.

just want to tell you, it sounds crazy, I know,

the things you need to know from me,

important that bothers me.

Oh.

1288
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,834
That's so true. That's so smart.
I didn't think of that.

1289
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:13,560
Clem, I need to make it back to where
I first met Brandy.

1290
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,355
To make everything happen.

That's when her dog's balls
got stuck on her porch.

and it was 40 below zero outside.

- Yeah.

But drunk is an understatement.

1310
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,432
They found you running naked with
a Roman candle sticking out of your ass.

1311
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,474
You tried to eat a bunch of pigeons,

1312
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,916
then you climbed onstage at
a Donnie Osmond concert,

1313
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,509
screaming, "What did y'all
do with Van Halen?"

1314
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:31,476
And then this huge guy punched you
incredibly hard directly in your testicles.

1315
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,834
(GROANING) Check this out.

1316
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:35,956
Oh, you're gonna love this.

1317
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,600
(GROANS)

1318
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,034
Ah! That's me!

1319
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:44,074
Your balls are basically like, "Hey, man, let's
go see what his throat is talking about!"

1320
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,160
Oh!

1321
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,669
There was a tour bus that was driving by.
There was a bunch of Japanese,

1322
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,355
and you know how those people
are with their cameras.

1323
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,589
My wife is Asian!

1324
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,878
What's up with the jokes? Like, what are
you, some grand wizard or something?

1325
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,795
- No, man, I didn't say nothing.
- You nodded.

1326
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,071
You nodded like a motherfucker.

1327
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:06,792
Anyway, the punch was so masterful
that your testicles are up way inside you

1328
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,834
and they would have gone a lot higher
had they not bounced off your heart.

1329
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,640
Oh, wait, my ball sack's where?

1330
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:13,949
Your balls are in your stomach

1331
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,391
and your sacks are literally
being digested as we speak.

1332
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:22,000
And that's not fantastic, so what we're
gonna have to do is yank them out.

1333
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:25,152
- You mean, gently extract?
- Yes.

1334
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,352
By extract we mean yank.

1335
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:32,834
And so, we have these things that look like
salad tongs. Actually they are salad tongs

1336
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,559
from the Sizzler salad bar.

1337
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,679
You know, there's always some good pussy
at Sizzler.

1338
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:42,239
Sizzler, yeah. I'm usually buried in
cornbread. I don't look up.

1339
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:46,593
I usually say this may hurt a bit,
but this is definitely gonna hurt.

Damn, man, why are you yelling?
Why did you yell in my ear?

1345
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,632
Well it hurt, like a mofo!

1346
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,400
Yeah, but what about my ear?

1347
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,314
You could've turned your face that way.
You could've screamed at that wall.

1348
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,075
But you wanted to yell in my... Ew! Whoa!

1349
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,360
- Whoa, what?
- Whoa.

1350
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:10,720
Whoa, good news?

1351
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:15,634
Uh, you can say that I definitely
extracted your balls.

1352
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,800
A lot of credit goes to
the workout regimen I've been on.

1353
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,391
They're hanging a little low, man.

1354
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,914
They do hang, but how low?

1355
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,120
Remember Clackers?

1356
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,591
Oh, Clackers, that's my balls.
Oh, that's too far.

1357
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,831
Don't worry, balls have a great
healing mechanism.

1358
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:31,920
You'll be back May, June.

1359
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:36,793
Wait, May or June?
I've got to go to Silvertown by tomorrow!

1360
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,549
Uh, you shouldn't do that.
You shouldn't travel.

1361
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,519
See, your balls look like tube socks
with lemons in them.

1362
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,231
And that's usually the side effect from
the yankotomy I performed.

1363
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,832
Oh, but if I don't go to Silvertown,
I don't meet Brandy,

1364
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:53,078
and my whole future is thrown off.
Do you understand? I gotta go!

01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:11,840
FOGGLE: Who are you?

1470
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:16,558
I've come to check on my boy, Joe Dirt.
He's my goose that lays the golden eggs.

1471
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,752
You don't mess with my goose,
unless you're a gander.

1472
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,837
- Tell me, are you a gander?
- No!

1473
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:24,640
No, I'm not a gander!

1474
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,271
Clem, I'm so glad to see you, man.
But I gotta get out of here.

1475
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,919
I've got to get to
Brandy's house right now!

1476
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,958
I want those boots, pissant!

1477
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,952
Joe, go meet your woman.

1478
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,591
I will take care of these dunskies.

1479
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,996
You know, we're kind of running
the show here.

1480
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,790
We've got our chains and knives.

1481
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,519
Don't bring a knife to a gunfight.

1482
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,039
Especially if I've got the guns.

1483
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,480
Not now, darling.

1484
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,232
Hey, Clem,
you don't have to do this for me, buddy.

1485
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,158
Joe Dirt, we may meet again someday.

1486
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,240
I don't know.

1487
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:58,199
But for that to happen,
you must meet your destiny.

1488
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:02,073
You've learned how hot it is
when you lose your shade tree.

1489
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,479
Go get your shade tree back.

1490
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,910
Thanks, man.

1491
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:09,159
Hey, by the way, why doesn't it sound
fruity when you say that?

1492
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,472
You don't have time for the explanation.

1493
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,751
I don't. Bye, Foggle. I gotta go.

1494
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,320
- Whoo-hoo-hoo.
- Joe Dirt.

1495
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,520
Joe Dirt!

1496
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:18,920
Ah.

1497
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,200
And you.

1498
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:25,158
You're done with Joe Dirt.
You must never haunt his dreams again.

1499
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,876
You must never be that voice of doubt
that makes him think he's not good.

1500
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,717
Your dance with Joe Dirt is done.

1501
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,229
I'll let you know when it's over.

1502
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:40,678
Hey, does your mother sew?

1503
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,394
Ka-boom-baf!

1504
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,551
- Get her to stitch that!

1506
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,517
(GASPS) Charlie!

1507
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,198
We've got to get you unstuck.

1508
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,037
Is there anybody out
there that will help me?

1509
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,400
Oh, it's you!

1510
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,560
Yeah.

1511
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,871
Thank goodness. We've gotta help Charlie.

1512
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,236
I was born to help Charlie.
What's going on?

1513
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,319
I was thinking maybe
warm water and a spatula?

1514
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,800
- That's a great idea.
- Okay.

1515
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,318
Man, keep your mouth shut, mutt.

1516
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:39,920
- (GRUNTS)
- (YELPS)

1517
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,595
All right. I'm looking at you, too.
He's all good. Come on back.

1518
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:43,800
Oh!

1519
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,238
Charlie! (LAUGHS)

1520
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,758
- Jimmy, thank you!
- You're welcome.

1521
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,032
- It ain't nothing.
- How did you do that?

1522
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,919
Don't worry about it.
That's a guy thing, right there.

1523
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:55,916
(PANTING)

1524
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,833
Brandy, hey.

1525
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,796
I'm sorry, do I know you?

1526
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:03,440
It's me, Brandy, Joe Dirt.

1527
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:04,920
JIMMY: Joe Dirt?

1528
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,270
What kind of name is that?

1529
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:11,033
It's me. We're supposed to meet here,
right now. Right exactly now, with Charlie.

1530
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:15,077
We become friends,
and eventually we get married.

1531
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,953
JIMMY: Boy, what are you talking about?

1532
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,600
Is you wasted or something?

1533
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,555
Um, Mr. Dirt, I can't talk right now.

1534
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,232
- Jimmy and I need to tend to my dog.
- Brandy, I'm rich now.

1535
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,189
I'm super rich.

1536
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,474
I'm somebody that's worth loving.

1537
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:34,310
Mr. Dirt, money doesn't interest me
all that much.

1538
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,994
I'm more interested in a man that is kind.

1539
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:41,990
Like somebody that would
help a dog in distress.

1540
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:47,077
Well, hell, just yesterday, I saved 15
raccoons by giving them mouth-to-mouth

1541
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,197
'cause they was choking
on garbage and stuff.

1542
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,834
Heck, I'll save anybody.

1543
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,360
Especially you, Brandy.

1544
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,956
You know, 'cause I am armed!

1545
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,232
A-R-M-D right there.

1546
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:00,320
BRANDY: Well,

1547
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,080
it was nice meeting you, Mr. Dirt.

1548
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:03,640
JIMMY: Yeah, later, Dirt.

1549
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:11,677
- Jimmy, would you like some ice cream?
- Why, hells to the yes. Get on in there!

And that was it.

1555
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:35,040
I missed my destiny.

1556
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,110
Just like that it was all gone.

1557
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,873
I'm sorry, Joe. I really am.

1558
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,952
Thanks for listening. I appreciate it.

1559
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,600
Right now you're probably
the only friend I have.

01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,840

He got kicked to the curb!

1564
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,510
Joe Dirt fucked up a couple things.

1565
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:11,311
TOBY: Damn, she just left him.

1566
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:14,832
That boy was left with nothing.

1567
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:19,560
But, you know, last time
all he had was his freedom.

1568
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:20,840
And you know what freedom is.

1569
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,040
BOTH: Yeah.

1570
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:26,239
Just another word for nothing left to lose.

1571

Look at you all growed up
and being Starsky and Putz!

1572
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,433
I had a cousin named Randy.

1573
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:41,600
Yeah.

1574
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:46,880
But much like Ned Beatty braced against
the shale wall in <i>Deliverance,</i>

1575
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,000
this time he's got shit tons to lose.

1576
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:55,676
But, come on, it's Joe Dirt. There's always
one more ace up his wife-beater.

1577
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,075
Let's pick this story back up.

Hey, dude. Where'd you come from?
You scared the crap out of me.

1583
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,269
Looks like you've just
completely given up, huh, Joe?

1584
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,518
Look out... Oh, man,
that car just drove through you!

1585
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:23,714

Are you some sort of ghost or something?

Put your hand right here. Just touch it.

Oh, no, that's your private parts, man.

1588
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,631
Private, but you're invited.
Go ahead. Put it right there.

1589

It'll go right through me. I won't even
feel it. I won't even feel it. Go ahead.

- No man, don't say that. That's wrong.

you can get me off again.

No, I didn't get you off, man,
I ain't no party boy.

Come on, Joe. I'm just messing with you.
I was trying to lighten the mood.

01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,751
I never figured you for a quitter.

1603
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:14,553
Yeah, I also said, "Say it, don't
spray it." But that Joe's gone, man.

1604
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,395
"Life's a garden, dig it,"
ain't nothing but a bumper sticker.

1605
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:21,031
Well, don't you think that sometimes bumper
stickers have a little bit of truth in them?

1606
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:26,076
Yeah, you know the one that says, "Wrap it
in latex, or she'll get your paychecks."

1607
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:28,352
- That one's got lots of truth. Yeah.
- (CHUCKLES) Sure.

1608
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,190
Sure, and then I remember
that one that said "Coexist."

1609
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,480
(CHUCKLES)

1610
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,040
Yeah, that's not as funny.

1611
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:39,309
And then they took the coexist
and they changed it to "Joe-exist"

1612
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,513
to put his hands on dick.

1613
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,956
Come on, Joe. I want you to come with me.
I want to show you something.

1614
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,190
I wanna take you to Silvertown.

1,000 miles away. Literally and finger...

just going for some

is just a second away.

1622
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,280
All right.

Wait a second, is this Silvertown?

01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,991
Oh, man, it's all gone to hell.
What happened?

1626
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:19,353
You didn't happen, Joe.
It all went to hell.

1627
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:25,074
Although, my guess is you would have
rather had it go to the Thunder Down Under.

1628
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,719
The Thunder Down Under show?
That's a bunch of dudes dancing around.

Why do you keep saying crap like that?

to get your hand on my dick.

we all want what we can't have.

1632
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,796
You want to touch what's on
the other side of the light,

1633
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:41,037
and the closest thing to you was my dick.

1634
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,157
But you wanted to wear it
like a fucking wristwatch,

1635
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,357
which would be great, right?
Then you could say,

1636

"Oh, what time is it?
It's 15 minutes to dick."

Right?

1647

don't mean you can't have sex with it.

Well, he got rich, Joe.
He got rich as hell.

1663

But all he does anymore is sit around
and pop Molly cut with ketamine and shit.

01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,237
Lookey here, lookey here!

1794
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:12,070
Hey, Jimmy, ain't you just say
you married to Brandy now?

1795
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:18,591
She does her thing, I do my thing.
That's the way that thing goes.

1796
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,358
How you doing? Where are your friends at?

1797
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,234
Have you seen the Jacuzzi yet?
Whoo! You're going to love it.

1798
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,000
Come on now. You got a twin sister?

1799
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,196
Not cool.

1800
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:29,073
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- (WOMEN LAUGHING)

1801
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:32,880
Hey!

1802
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:34,876
Brandy!

1803
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,072
- How do I light this?
- This way, babe.

1804
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:40,910
You do it.

1805
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,320
KATRINA: This way, silly.

1806
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:45,440
Brandy?

1807
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:47,590
Hey!

1808
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,879
Hey! I remember you.

1809
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,279
You're that rich guy.

1810
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,716
You were going to help me with Charlie
when he was stuck.

1811
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,917
- Yeah.
- Until Jimmy beat you to it,

1812
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,480
and helped me instead.

1813
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,600
(SCOFFS)

1814
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:04,434
Might have been the last time
Jimmy helped me with anything.

1815
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:08,478
Look, it's the moron with
the Tennessee top hat.

1816
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:09,880
(LAUGHING)

1817
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,394
Tennessee top hat.

1818
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,960
That's actually a good one, fellas.
I had not heard that one before.

1819
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:16,960
- They've got some new stuff.
- CAL: Oh, yeah?

1820
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:19,879
I bet you never heard
that you're a winner, either!

1821
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,520
Jimmy would have liked that one!

1822
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:24,070
I love Jimmy!

1823
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:25,595
Where is Jimmy?

1824
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,638
Forget about Jimmy, baby.

1825
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:30,954
- You're with me now.
- Katrina, you're so sweet.

1826
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:33,800
- You're such a good friend to me.
- KATRINA: Oh, yeah.

1827
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:36,520
You look so hot tonight, Brandy.

1828
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,835
- Doesn't she look hot, boys?
- Yeah!

1829
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,150
CAL: Yes!

1830
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,237
I don't think she looks that hot.

1831
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,639
I mean, no, I mean she's gorgeous,

1832
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:49,674
but that's not the Brandy I'm used to.
You don't look like that.

1833
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,991
I mean, you look slutty
hot, and that's good.

1834
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,914
Slutty hot is good,
it's just not the regular hot.

1835
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,510
But believe me, there's a place
for slutty hot, guys like that.

1836
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,872
But Brandy isn't that kind of hot,
you're innocent, sweet hot.

1837
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:04,636
I mean, sluts are great. You know what?
I'm digging a hole. I can get out of it.

1838
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:07,400
Uh, Brandy, what's been happening
in Silvertown?

1839
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:10,236
(MOANING)

1840
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,397
Brandy's been happening.

1841
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:20,591
Oh, boy, I didn't think those
M's was ever going to stop.

1842
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,997
This girl's got more M's than M&M's.

1843
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:25,830
'Cause M&M's...

1844
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,674
No laughs. Absolutely zero.

1845
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,359
When Jimmy's here you
laugh at everything...

1846
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,039
He cuts a fart,
everyone cracks up for two hours.

1847
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:34,033
This town is called Jimmy Town now.

1848
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:38,510
My husband renamed it.
I kind of miss the old name.

1849
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,234
And all that came with it.

1850
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:43,679
Mmm. Brandy?

1851
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:47,396
I'd like to be all that
came with it to you.

1852
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,353
Katrina, that tickles.

1853
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:53,838
Jimmy will get mad. He always gets mad.

1854
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:57,791
No, he'll just grab a camera and pop a rod.

1855
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,391
You're just a lost little girl, Brandy.

1856
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:02,433
I didn't used to be.

1857
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:06,152
I used to be a strong, independent woman.

1858
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:08,592
I don't know what happened to me.

1859
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,356
- It could be the heroin.
- Heroin, man?

1860
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:14,230
What's going on in this town?
It's all mixed up.

1861
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:17,400
I don't know what is and isn't
mixed up anymore.

1862
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,119
You're so deep, Brandy.

1863
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:21,590
You like when I do this to you, don't you?

1864
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:25,756
I bet you're wearing those silk little
panties I bought for you, ain't you?

1865
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:29,120
Don't say ain't or your mother will faint.

1866
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:32,989
- Your father will fall into a bucket of paint.
- Your father will fall into a bucket of paint.

1867
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:37,159
Wow. You and me.

1868
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:40,031
We have a connection, Joe Dirt.

1869
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,270
We used to always say that.

1870
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:45,275
I say it all the time to our kids...
To, uh... To my kids.

1871
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:49,512
Kiss me, Brandy. Like you mean it, girl.

1872
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:53,232
Don't be halfway with me no more, Brandy.

1873
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:56,956
Okay, that's it. Show's over, everybody.
Stop it right there, that's enough.

1874
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,639
- What are you doing?
- What the hell?

1875
01:37:58,720 --> 01:37:59,790
What are you, queer?

1876
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,356
Hey,

1877
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:04,116
Brandy, in another life we get married,
we fall in love.

1878
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:07,392
We have three beautiful kids,
Cheyenne, Abilene and Dakota.

1879
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,272
Those are such sweet names.

1880
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:11,760
Well, that's because you picked them.

1881
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,832
- I picked dumb names.
- Stay on topic, Joe.

1882
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:16,879
Oh, man, you scare me because you
come out of nowhere sometimes.

1883
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,555
Tell her. Tell her what you've learned.

1884
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:21,472
- Tell her how you feel now.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

1885
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:22,750
I think I got it.

1886
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,314
- Who's he talking to?
- I don't know.

1887
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,995
All right, Brandy. Me and you was together.

1888
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:29,391
And everything was going great,
and we was really happy.

1889
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:32,552
And then something terrible happened,
and I got taken away from you and the kids,

1890
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:36,554
and then now,
I think I'm sent back to learn a lesson

1891
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,680
- that if I have money...
- Oh, what the hell!

1892
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:43,840
Come on! Damn it, Joe,
you still don't get it?

1893
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:47,992
Look, they told me you were dumb,
but it's almost like you're an

1894
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,549
"I'm joking" kind of dumb.
Look, I give up here.

1895
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,439
I guess I'm not going to get my wings

1896
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:55,035
and I'm never going to hear
that beautiful sound.

1897
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,870
What sound?

1898
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:00,431
Well, you hear a certain kind of clang
when an angel gets its wings. Whatever.

1899
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:02,557
- I, look...
- Oh, wait.

1900
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:06,156
When an angel gets its wings? That's from
a movie or something, like a TV show?

1901
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:07,794
KATRINA: Shut up, dude!

1902
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:10,636
You're seriously bumming out the vibe
in this room.

1903
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:14,078
Brandy here had a monsoon in her panties,
thinking about me.

1904
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:17,319
And then you walk in here not remembering
lines from <i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i>

1905
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:18,436
That's it.

1906
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:21,399
I'm trying to get down,
and you're getting me down.

1907
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:27,000
Look, this is just too confusing.

1908
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:28,356
I've had too much to drink.

1909
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:30,389
I got to go.

1910
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,194
- I got to go.
- Let me... Can I talk...

1911
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:35,430
What did you do?

1912
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:42,149
Brandy, I think I know what I'm supposed
to know now.

1913
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:43,390
I'm going to be different!

1914
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,392
I don't know what you're saying,
just please stop.

1915
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,554
I'm married to Jimmy.

1916
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:50,555
But he doesn't feel like
he's married to me.

1917
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:54,518
My life feels like it is
spinning out of control.

1918
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:56,516
(SNIFFLING)

1919
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:58,240
Goodbye, Joe Dirt.

1920
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,440
Well, that went great.

1921
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:09,078
I don't know what's going on anymore, man.
I don't know what I'm supposed to learn.

1922
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:10,755
Well, you're not very bright.

1923
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:13,231
Come on, I ain't no toaster scientist.

1924
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,591
What am I supposed to learn?
I bench 150 on a good day.

1925
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:18,919
The fact that I'm supposed to memorize
a spark-plug gap

1926
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:20,959
on a Plymouth 383?

1927
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,639
I don't know. I just want my old life back.

1928
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:24,910
150's not that great.

1929
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,880
Hey, Clair.

1930
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:30,509
Hey, wait, you're that woman that yelled
at me on the bus bench.

1931
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,592
That's right. You fart-eater.

1932
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:37,238
I'm the good witch. I'm the one
that sent this hunky angel to you.

1933
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:40,000
- No offence, Clair.
- No offence? Really? Okay.

1934
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:44,154
He's like that angel that saved that
cracker-ass Jimmy Stewart.

1935
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:46,590
And helped that white, racist-ass town.

1936
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:50,800
Tell me something, how come they don't
ever have any angels to save a black town?

1937
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,515
You don't think black towns could
use some help once in a while?

1938
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:57,316
You ever seen Detroit?
That town is sucking some misery dick.

1939
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:01,355
How come them bitches in Hollywood don't
throw us a bone every once in a while?

1940
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,314
Wait a second, you're the good witch?

1941
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:07,550
Well, maybe you should
work on your, like, presentation,

1942
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:09,597
because it comes off a little
rough around the edges.

1943
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:11,634
But I have to say, ma'am,
with all due respect,

1944
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:13,992
this is who I am. I'm Joe Dirt.

1945
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:15,960
Okay? And I'm fine with it.

1946
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:18,112
I'm not mean to other people like you are.

1947
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:21,000
In fact, I made some money
with this guy, Clem,

1948
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:23,152
and if you need it for that city, Detroit,

1949
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:25,950
then you could have it all to help them.
I don't care.

1950
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:30,072
Because I thought it was about being rich,
and showing my family I had a lot of money,

1951
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:32,152
and being famous like Lynyrd Skynyrd,

1952
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,036
but that don't matter.

1953
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:39,151
