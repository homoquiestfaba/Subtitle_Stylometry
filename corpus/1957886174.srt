1
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,301
So, what do we have?

2
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:21,679
He is.

3
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,830
And what about all your equipment?

4
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:28,199
Then, we will. Dino, radio.

5
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:32,582
I head Bravo to Attack Command!

6
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,353
White confirmed.

7
00:01:34,354 --> 00:01:36,912
We're going to attack. I repeat, we 
are going to attack.

8
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:38,447
<-O->Man: Copied. <-O->Roger out.

9
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:41,006
<-O->Dino, fast, leave. <-O->
Dino: we're on it.

10
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:42,920
Cubrenos.

11
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:03,440
<-O -> what happens? <-O->Has 
hostages... children.

12
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:05,015
Life sucks sometimes. We will.

13
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:08,662
<-O->Wait. <-O->We have two 
minutes.

14
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:13,322
Agree, go get the children. We will 
make some noise.

15
00:02:13,323 --> 00:02:15,485
Are you a son of a bitch, do you know?

16
00:02:15,486 --> 00:02:17,164
We will.

17
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:34,732
Go, go, I will Not hurt you.

18
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,529
We Will, We Will.

00:02:52,997 --> 00:02:55,855
Come on, rapido. You'll be fine.

20
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:02,625
Come on, quickly. Move on now!

21
00:03:07,678 --> 00:03:10,039
We will. Bring them out of here. Come 
on, rapido.

22
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,859
<-O -> Hey! Hey!

23
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,243
I Sueltala! I Sueltala!

24
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:19,446
I Sueltala!

25
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:21,321
It is already very late. It is too 
late.

26
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:26,255
<-O->Get in the truck. <-O -> Oh, 
Let Me!

27
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:27,751
It is the end. We will.

28
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:29,981
It demons, let me go back!

29
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,126
Sometimes you can't save them all.

30
00:04:31,713 --> 00:04:33,758
<-O->I. Fuck.

31
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,254
Hello!

32
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:36,499

33
00:04:43,954 --> 00:04:47,953
Hey guys! Guys, this is a ramp for 
wheelchairs.

34
00:04:49,976 --> 00:04:51,903

little twist...

00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:02,846

<-O->Hey, hey, we Already talk

47
00:05:21,603 --> 00:05:23,865
<-O->Ahi va, continuous. <-O->

48
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,084
Oh, a punishment?

49
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:26,383
<-O -> what makes You feel better? 
<-O->That's good.

<-O->Well. <-O->fucking Asshole.

00:05:37,956 --> 00:05:40,199
<-O->Whoa, Mick. <-O->Shit.

56
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,604
We will. What you said about skating 
in the corridors?

57
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:47,639
In truth, it is a fucking skate, but 
I'm not going to follow your rules.

58
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,156
Well, I if. You have punishment.

59
00:05:50,157 --> 00:05:55,063
<-O->Here you go, Mick. <-O->Hey 
great thing, man.

60
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,589
Leon, cumpa.

61
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:04,483
Uh, is Decker.

62
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:05,743
<-O->Shit. Decker. <-O -> What?

63
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:08,721
Is my teacher, man. Hold on just a 
little. Shit.

64
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:15,845
How Jay Tee, don't you have classes?

65
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:19,323
Come on guys, is a school zone.

66
00:06:19,324 --> 00:06:22,156
Move. It is not a parking lot.

67
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:24,478
Yeah.

68
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,748
Do you have a problem, bitch?

69
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:31,170
No.

70
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:32,573
No, you have a problem.

71
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:38,019
I.

72
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,829
Do you listen to, you?

73
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,836
Wow, pretty daring for a teacher.

74
00:06:41,837 --> 00:06:44,867
What do you teach? Teach... what 
about poetry?

75
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,717
Do you make love, not war, right?

76
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:48,842
Very good, Leon. Ah, yes.

77
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:50,600
No, it is...

78
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,851
Is physical education and history.

79
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:57,842
See, this is physical education...

80
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:00,414
Oh Whoa!

81
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:03,156
<-O->That is my teacher.
And you are history.

82
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:08,116
What I don't want to see them again 
here, I understand?

83
00:07:09,272 --> 00:07:10,516
We will.

84
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:17,222
Oh, if you.

85
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:21,459
<-O->Hey, Sam. <-O -> Hey, like 
these?

86
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,862
What Leon and the guys giving you 
other problems?

87
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,268
Oh, I have a little present for you.

88
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:31,338
Here you go.

89
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:34,698
Hey, I have a gift for you.

90
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:36,784
Is what I pulled out of one of your 
students, of the block.

91
00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:40,037
I can not have it in the car so, here 
you go.

92
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:45,915
I don't know, Sam.

93
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:49,759
Sometimes I feel like in Bosnia, 
again.

94
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:56,424
Hello, Mr. Decker.

95
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:59,953
Oh, this so good!

96
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:09,885
Excuse me, please.

97
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:12,287
Hey, Willy, more slowly.

98
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:13,612
Hey, calmese, Mr. D.

99
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:17,876
<-O -> what, Nick? <-O->Barbaro.

100
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:20,828
<-O->Whoa. <-O -> why don't you 
go more slowly?

101
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:23,426
Why don't you watch where you're 
going, huh?

102
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:25,457
Agree, agree. What Willy, listen, stay

103
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:27,244
under the lights of the hallways, 
right?

104
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:29,015
<-O->Well, Mr. D
Let.

105
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:32,124
<-O->Muerete. <-O->Well, look, 
Alice,

106
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,880
the composition test will not be 
written alone.

107
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,596
How well, and how it is supposed to 
find the time to do it, Mr. Decker?

108
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:40,731
Do I have other things more important 
to worry about now, ok?

109
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:09,320
What do you think about this, kitten?

110
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:11,603
Very cute. What do you think?

111
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:13,453
Ah, nice.

112
00:09:13,454 --> 00:09:16,273
Disgusting.

113
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:19,908
For a secondary school.

114
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:22,743
Who would suspect of a secondary 
school?

115
00:09:22,744 --> 00:09:24,553
It is perfect.

116
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:26,979
Just get the photos.

117
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:31,309
Do you have them?

118
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:37,070
2,000 a week, medical assistance, and 
participation of the profits.

119
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:38,210
Starts Monday.

120
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,519
Perfect.

121
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,395
I already have enough with students 
having sex like rabbits.

122
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:47,461
I don't need the teachers to get 
worse.

123
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,995
If.

124
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:52,066
Well, in truth, I think that you have 
something of reason, Lyle.

125
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:54,924
I don't see another alternative so I 
have to resign.

126
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:59,018
This is my letter of resignation, 
effective as of today.

127
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:02,443
I'm sorry, I'm late for my history 
class.

128
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,628
Are you joking, not?

129
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:09,842
No. Not, it is.

130
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:15,957
Then, the bombing campaign aeros of 
the united States,

131
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,649
failure to defeat the north.

132
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,066
Does anyone know why?

133
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:21,469
<-O -> do Man: who cares? <-O->
Hey. What about Charlee?

134
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,104
<-O->Oh <-O -> why was it so 
important?

135
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:26,584
<-O->Excuse me, Mr. Decker, not 
what is. <-O->neither do I, lord.

136
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:29,655
Of that we are talking about... 
<-O->Well, guys, silence. Do you 
Mick?

137
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:33,473
What is the goal? Who fucking cares 
the story to the end?

138
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:35,953
<-O -> what There is, See? <-O->
The reason is this.

139
00:10:35,954 --> 00:10:39,062
Not interested in who has more bombs 
or soldiers.

140
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:43,260
The one that has a greater commitment 
to their cause, it will expire.

141
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,130
<-O -> Thanks! <-O->Well, guys.

142
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:48,862
<-O->Many Thanks. <-O->Very well, 
Mick.

143
00:10:48,863 --> 00:10:51,638
Very well, get out of here. I will 
see you in the gym.

144
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,349
<-O -> I'm open! <-O->Defence.

145
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,120
Let's go, lightly run! I Whoo-hoo!

146
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,036
<-O->I have it. <-O -> What?

147
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:00,316
Come on, find your zone.

148
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:01,694
What are you looking at?

149
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,898
<-O->A HMT <-S -> What is an HMT?

150
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,679
H-M-T, Man mature tradable.

151
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:09,762
What if? Only not to become pregnant.

152
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:11,809
You're a good teacher, Sam.

153
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,659
The kind of teacher that we can't 
afford to lose.

154
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,784
Come on, Lyle, we're not teaching you 
anything.

155
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:18,068
This is not a school, it is a prison.

156
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:19,592
Just stop these guys until they are

157
00:11:19,593 --> 00:11:20,981
old enough to graduate

158
00:11:20,982 --> 00:11:23,696
with diplomas that can't read.

159
00:11:23,697 --> 00:11:25,979
It is my last day.

160
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,671
Agree.

161
00:11:27,672 --> 00:11:30,151
The breast of Macer is in the 
hospital.

162
00:11:30,152 --> 00:11:33,104
I need someone to take care of the 
kind of penance.

163
00:11:33,105 --> 00:11:35,426
What?

164
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:37,749
What are you going to do to become 
after time?

165
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,739
Well, don't think of this as a 
punishment.

166
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,425
Veil more as a... a gesture of 
farewell.

167
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:55,328
You son of a bitch!

168
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,436
<-O -> it Ends with that! <-O->
Leave It, Jay Tee.

169
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:02,860
Well. Come on, enough is enough. Hey.

170
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:04,158
Is enough.

171
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,244
The idiot threatened to kill me. You 
can expel them by that.

172
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:07,662
<-O -> What? <-O->Let.

173
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:09,748
<-O->The punishment should be 
enough. <-O -> For what?

174
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:12,306
You can't fix it. Oi out there that 
you are criticizing Alicia.

175
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:13,959
What happened? Does the alcohol was 
very good and fell?

176
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,849
<-O -> What? <-O->enough is 
enough. I said enough is enough.

177
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,574
Go to the showers. Hey! We will, to 
the showers.

178
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,101
Federal Agent Glen Prokow, Secret 
Service.

179
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:39,171
As of now, this precinct and its 
units are under my control

180
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:40,960
during the visit of the 
vice-president.

181
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:41,984
What?

182
00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:43,519
This crazy. Does not have the 
authority.

183
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,526
The federal law allows me.

184
00:12:45,527 --> 00:12:47,061
What since when?

185
00:12:47,062 --> 00:12:50,603
April 15, 1865. The day he shot 
Lincoln.

186
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,345
I this fucking.

187
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:21,581
Lyle has fucked up.

188
00:13:21,582 --> 00:13:22,683
Yes, I know.

189
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:24,572
Put Me in punishment.

190
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:25,935
Oh.

191
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:30,318
As you know, I think she really likes 
you,

192
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:31,853
God knows why.

193
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,742
It is not him. It is...

194
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:36,012
it is this site.

195
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:38,426
I don't know why you want to stay.

196
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:40,630
You already know me.

197
00:13:40,631 --> 00:13:43,215
And besides, this place reminds me 
of...

198
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:46,206
some good times.

199
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:52,425
Mr. Decker, I need to see in your 
living room for a moment.

200
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:58,068
Vamoes, I will arrive late to the 
punishment.

201
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:59,563
It doesn't matter.

202
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:02,541
I want to be for the last time with 
the professor.

203
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:30,894
Oh, girl, what happens? Are you ok?

204
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:33,517
Nothing. Get out of my sight.

205
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:38,569
Do you listen, why don't you come 
with me?

206
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,799
Perhaps in another life.

207
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,293
Let's go, babe I know a good place

208
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:45,050
where we can have fun.

209
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:51,505
Excellent, kitten.

210
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:05,137
What are you doing?

211
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:08,877
You would not want to cut the 
upholstery

212
00:15:08,878 --> 00:15:11,081
because it must be perfect.

213
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:15,161
Gloria, tell him to be careful, in 
Hungarian.

214
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:19,371
To shit.

215
00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:23,465
We speak English, imbecil.

216
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:29,108
If you ruin this,

217
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:31,785
they metere this gun up your ass,

218
00:15:31,786 --> 00:15:33,896

will like it.

219
00:15:36,941 --> 00:15:38,225
Back to work.

220
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:55,715
Well...

221
00:15:55,716 --> 00:15:58,130
I see that they are all happy to be 
here, as much as I do.

222
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,681
<-O -> Alice? <-O->The 
replacement of Math I punishment.

224
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,696
Let it be an excuse for being late to 
class.

225
00:16:11,697 --> 00:16:14,319
What is this, a maternity?

226

00:25:06,093 --> 00:25:07,652
Well.

342
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,216
Wait.

343
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:14,934
Well, you're in luck.

344
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,916
Where are they?

345
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:36,517
Are you ready for the night, Sam?

346
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:39,666
Yes, it would. We have two fugitives.

347
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:41,948
Ashton and Barrow escaped by the roof.

348
00:25:41,949 --> 00:25:43,917
Could not get out.

349
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:45,910
The school is closed. I will meet you.

350
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:51,224
Yes, of course.

351
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:08,148
Very well, guys. Out.

352
00:26:08,912 --> 00:26:12,281
It is not a night to urinate the big 
man.

353
00:26:14,343 --> 00:26:15,588
Surprise!

354
00:26:28,985 --> 00:26:31,647
Shhh.

355
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:38,628
Well, it confirms the time. Don 
Hogarth!

356
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:40,478
Make sure that she climb into the 
van, ok.

357
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:42,668
Hello, is Hogie.

358
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,210
And I'm not a goddamn nurse.

359
00:26:47,957 --> 00:26:49,255
What is your problem, Hogarth?

360
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:52,429
Are you too hard to help a 
mother-to-be?

361
00:26:58,781 --> 00:27:01,601
Shit.

362
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:04,710
We will. See if you are going to come.

363
00:27:23,381 --> 00:27:25,098
Uh-oh.

364
00:27:30,978 --> 00:27:34,283
Glory, kitten, you see.

365
00:27:34,284 --> 00:27:37,196
<-O->Here I am. <-O->The guard is 
"toasted".

366
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,951
However, we have three other white...

367
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:41,984
Two students and...

368
00:27:43,258 --> 00:27:45,172
the teacher.

369
00:27:45,738 --> 00:27:48,571
Looks to Alek and Victor

370
00:27:48,572 --> 00:27:50,539
and send them to the doors of the 
front.

371
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,572
The teacher is coming towards here.

372
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:55,577
Is mine.

373
00:27:55,578 --> 00:27:58,909
The main corridor, now.

374
00:28:05,064 --> 00:28:07,332
We will.

375
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,523
Do you see it?

376
00:28:23,524 --> 00:28:26,357
Nop, it's gone. Oh shit, Mr. D.... 
fuck.

377
00:28:26,358 --> 00:28:28,640
What Mick, Jay Tee?

378
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:29,938
Let's go, let's go!

379
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:32,326
The punishment ended, geniuses.

380
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,898
Ah, ah, ah... Hold, hold.

381
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:37,260
The teacher goes to the cafeteria.

382
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:40,277
Alek to the cafeteria. We will.

383
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:43,898
Come on, guys.

384
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:52,478
We will. Let's get out of here. Fast.

385
00:28:52,927 --> 00:28:54,800
We are going home.

386
00:29:00,995 --> 00:29:04,458
Punishment, give me responsibility... 
oh, whoa!

387
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:06,977
Does god, who was that?

388
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:09,378
Oh shit! Guns... automatic.

389
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:10,952
I know that sound anywhere! Come on!

390
00:29:10,953 --> 00:29:13,458
What are you doing? Do you want to 
live? Runs.

391
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:25,187
<-O -> Who would be in a school? 
<-O -> how in the hell do you want 
to know?

392
00:29:38,624 --> 00:29:40,183
What where these?!

393
00:29:57,674 --> 00:29:59,090
We don't have time! We're going for 
here!

394
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:02,698
<-O->Wait... no! <-O -> oh, 
Forget that portfolio of crap! Come 
on!

395
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:07,224
<-O -> Now What? <-O->Ve, hide it.

396
00:30:32,075 --> 00:30:34,501
<-O -> Where are you guys? <-O -> 
I'm gonna get!

397
00:30:43,686 --> 00:30:46,073
<-O->¡Escondete! <-S -> Maybe is 
open!

398
00:30:51,755 --> 00:30:53,827
There is No sign of the two boys.

399
00:30:54,668 --> 00:30:56,910
Okay, everybody, listen.

400
00:30:56,911 --> 00:30:59,272
Let's see if we can

401
00:30:59,273 --> 00:31:01,555
to finish with this and find them.

402
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:04,453
Make sure the room fits the purpose.

403
00:31:07,342 --> 00:31:08,404
Did you hear that?

404
00:31:08,405 --> 00:31:09,649
If.

405
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:12,641
Oh, shit!

406
00:31:13,325 --> 00:31:14,805
It destroyed everything!

407
00:31:16,513 --> 00:31:18,598
I was thinking...

408
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,749
We're going to bust these guys.

409
00:31:24,346 --> 00:31:26,076
We may need this.

410
00:31:26,077 --> 00:31:27,558
<-O->Despáchalos. <-O->If.

411
00:32:18,013 --> 00:32:19,665
Testing. One, two, testing.

412
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,751
To those who are in the school, 
listen.

413
00:32:21,752 --> 00:32:23,050
That is Mr. Decker.

414
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:24,742
There are people in the school with 
guns.

415
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:27,322
I repeat, there are people in the 
school with guns.

416
00:32:27,323 --> 00:32:29,977
Have killed Milt. This isn't a joke, 
ok?

417
00:32:29,978 --> 00:32:32,654
Kitten. Service "Soon".

418
00:32:32,655 --> 00:32:35,789
<-O->they Have killed the security 
guard. <-O->Shit are going to ruin 
my day.

419
00:32:37,181 --> 00:32:38,977
There are two.

420
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:45,196
That are four.

421
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,335
Now exit the school if you can.

422
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:48,556
If you can't get out, escondanse.

423
00:32:48,557 --> 00:32:51,863
Guys, don't try to be heroes. This is 
not a video game.

424
00:32:51,864 --> 00:32:53,358
These are murderers.

425
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,971
If nothing boludeces, CNN.

426
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:57,043
Oh fuck!

427
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,483
How is it that he could pass this up?

428
00:33:05,836 --> 00:33:07,631
Guys, this is not a trick.

429
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:40,733
I professor!

430
00:33:56,085 --> 00:33:57,186
Do you Baby, are you okay?

431
00:33:57,187 --> 00:33:58,761
Well, now I'm really angry.

432
00:33:58,762 --> 00:34:01,305
That's my girl. We find that teacher.

433
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:46,727
I have you now.

434
00:36:17,078 --> 00:36:18,834
Sweet imagination, Jesus.

435
00:36:19,164 --> 00:36:20,645
Do you Viktor?

436
00:36:20,975 --> 00:36:22,548
What the hell happened to you, mate?

437
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:25,068
Two guys tried to cut my damn leg.

438
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:26,405
You have my weapon.

439
00:36:26,406 --> 00:36:27,390
Jesus.

440
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:30,446
It is as an agency for criminal minds 
small.

441
00:36:30,736 --> 00:36:32,624
The white will be here in 50 minutes.

442
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:33,924
Load the car with Alek.

443
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,523
And what about the professor?

444
00:36:36,168 --> 00:36:38,646
Collision course. Death 101.

445
00:36:38,647 --> 00:36:40,772
I love you. See.

446
00:36:40,773 --> 00:36:42,583
I've ordered all of these motorized 
units

447
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:44,039
they are in the airport for the 
parade.

448
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,534
I have more than a ton of heroin

449
00:36:45,535 --> 00:36:46,991
in this truck, that goes to the 
incinerator,

450
00:36:46,992 --> 00:36:49,549
and will do so without an escort. 
<-O->we Leave in 45 minutes.

451
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,186
You can't suggest that a shipment of 
heroin is more important

452
00:36:52,187 --> 00:36:53,997
the visit of the vice-president of 
the united States.

453
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:57,185
<-O->I Just have personal. <-O->
That is his apartment, Sergeant.

454
00:36:57,186 --> 00:36:59,783
My job is to protect the second most 
powerful man in the world.

455
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,564
I have no doubt as to which has 
priority.

456
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:05,294
Why not find something to do?

457
00:37:05,295 --> 00:37:06,736
Linda tie.

458
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,820
Testing.

459
00:37:09,821 --> 00:37:13,087
One, two, three.

460
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,593
Can you hear me?

461
00:37:20,724 --> 00:37:23,819
Professor, professor...

462
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:30,405
Lamb, inside.

463
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:36,756
Excellent, Kitten. Go to the 
auditorium.

464
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:39,156
Carries another weapon for Viktor.

465
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:42,763
Make sure that you use it.

466
00:37:44,077 --> 00:37:45,493
Oh my God.

467
00:37:45,494 --> 00:37:48,116
We will turn around and take the 
stairs.

468
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:51,476
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

469
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,783
Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

470
00:37:54,784 --> 00:37:56,750
Do this well, how to we go from here?

471
00:37:56,751 --> 00:37:58,704
The stage door, over there.

472
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:02,321
Shit, the door is closed. Is there 
another door?

473
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,820
<-O->I don't think. <-O->Best, 
there is another door.

474
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:06,813
<-O -> oh, No! <-O -> Oh, Demons!

475
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:10,487
<-O -> do These well? <-O->I'm 
really tired.

476
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,441
<-O->Shit. <-O -> What Hogie?

477
00:38:13,046 --> 00:38:16,338
<-O->Thank You. <-O->No, Thanks.

478
00:38:17,888 --> 00:38:20,742
<-O -> Hey, fuck! You do... <-O -> 
Let that gun!

479
00:38:20,743 --> 00:38:23,260
What do you think? I'm just trying 
not to kill me.

480
00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:26,173
<-O -> do You have followed the 
idiots, man? <-O -> what If, I 
don't know, okay?

481
00:38:26,174 --> 00:38:28,121
<-O -> do These well? <-O->will 
Arrive at any time.

482
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:29,419
<-O -> do You feel good? <-O->
does Not matter.

483
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,469
What do you mean with "does not 
matter" '?

484
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,623
I would like to know if Mr. Decker is 
well.

485
00:38:31,624 --> 00:38:33,585
<-O -> let you fuck with Mr. 
Decker! <-O->Oh, well.

486
00:38:40,245 --> 00:38:43,418
Sam... Decker.

487
00:38:43,984 --> 00:38:47,210
Go. I feel like I know you.

488
00:38:47,211 --> 00:38:49,833
Do you mind if I call you Sam?

489
00:38:53,194 --> 00:38:55,319
Now, Sam,

490
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,090
I'm going to explain everything to 
you.

491
00:38:57,091 --> 00:38:58,428
And what about those guys?

492
00:38:58,429 --> 00:39:00,593
We have them in the auditorium.

493
00:39:00,594 --> 00:39:03,427
Don't worry,

494
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:05,539
won't be going anywhere.

495
00:39:06,655 --> 00:39:07,796
The said two boys.

496
00:39:07,797 --> 00:39:09,489
Don't know of us.

497
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,561
So, do you have any place where to go?

498
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,015
I have an idea.

499
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:16,678
Do not go on.

500
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,225
We finished our work.

501
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:25,232
All the world is happy.

502
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:27,318
No one ever dies.

503
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:30,887
It is a safe play, Sam. What do you 
say?

504
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,908
Look, it is an important decision,

505
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,561
I will tell you that we are going to 
do.

506
00:39:40,562 --> 00:39:44,143
I just had sex, for which I am very 
relaxed.

507
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:46,215
You have three minutes.

508
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:53,157
<-O -> Oh, my God! <-O -> Are you 
okay?

509
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:54,810
No. Ow, ow... I don't know.

510
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:57,172
We are trapped in this auditorium, 
and they plan to kill us.

511
00:39:57,173 --> 00:39:58,981
<-O -> Hey, hey, hey! <-O->That's 
your first mistake.

512
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:02,130
<-O -> Oh shit, that hurts! <-O -> 
-, We'll be fine.

513
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:04,375
Yes, if you believe that we are as 
shit floating, ok!

514
00:40:04,376 --> 00:40:07,916
<-O -> do you Know how to shoot 
that? <-O -> Who do not know?

515
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:10,145
Because what I saw in the movies. How 
difficult can it be?

516
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:24,630
Two minutes, Sam.

517
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:42,435
90 seconds, Sam.

518
00:40:42,436 --> 00:40:46,450
How hectic the leak, huh?

519
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:49,087
Hey, give me a hand! Mierd...

520
00:40:49,088 --> 00:40:51,685
Oh, well. A fence. A damn...

521
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:53,181
Yes, that will hold you back!

522
00:40:53,182 --> 00:40:55,070
Hey, shut up, man. Why don't you give 
me a rope?

523
00:40:55,071 --> 00:40:56,409
What genius, do you have any idea?

524
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,554
I have a. Why don't you go and help?

525
00:40:58,555 --> 00:41:01,132
Unless you know how to help me birth 
this baby.

526
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:04,595
<-O->Rope. Rope. Do we need rope? 
<-O->Well.

527
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:06,943
<-O->Very well. <-O -> oh, faster!

528
00:41:10,461 --> 00:41:12,664

00:41:21,285 --> 00:41:23,396
Shut up!

531
00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:28,094
Look, it's in the engine room.

532
00:41:28,095 --> 00:41:30,599
I repeat, the engine room. We will.

533
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:52,340
Don't move, little one.

534
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:55,055
Oh, hi officer, ah...

535
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:56,000
Go down the stairs, now.

536
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:59,503
Yeah, sure, we're in a small party.

537
00:41:59,504 --> 00:42:00,959
Shut up, and recuestate along the 
handrail.

538
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,061
Well, sure.

539
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:04,698

00:42:04,699 --> 00:42:07,086
<-O->do Not do another move. <-O->
I will Not do it.

541
00:42:07,927 --> 00:42:11,547
If you move, I will kill you.

542
00:42:11,548 --> 00:42:14,643
<-O -> Do You Understand? <-O->
If, to be understood.

543
00:42:15,209 --> 00:42:17,175
<-O -> Bang!

544
00:42:17,176 --> 00:42:19,996
Did I get you fooled, huh?

545
00:42:21,428 --> 00:42:23,316
You said calm and quiet.

546
00:42:23,317 --> 00:42:27,331
And you said only one security guard.

547
00:42:27,332 --> 00:42:30,500
Is the trap Mr. Rogers neighborhood 
is here,

548
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:32,236

549
00:43:40,148 --> 00:43:41,825

00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:56,472
<-O -> what's this flames quiet? 
<-O->Oops.

551
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:20,457
Hello, candy. Oh who was that?!

552
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,188
What are you doing? Jesus Christ!

553
00:44:22,189 --> 00:44:24,039
Alek is dead.

554
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,662
And What About Decker?

555
00:44:27,267 --> 00:44:28,840
Guess.

556
00:44:28,841 --> 00:44:31,242
Very well, it brings to Viktor,

¡Twine, Mr. Rogers!

559
00:44:42,184 --> 00:44:43,508
Isn't he there?

560
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:47,483
Oh fuck!

561
00:44:48,325 --> 00:44:52,142

00:44:52,143 --> 00:44:54,621
Damn son of a bitch, die!

00:44:54,622 --> 00:44:57,259
Jesus! I teacher fucking!

564
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,879
What is your problem? Are you afraid 
of the triggers?

565
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,524
Listen to me, your, idiot, shooting 
my gun, and I get to file my papers.

566
00:45:05,525 --> 00:45:07,486
Do you want to shoot an innocent 
passerby?

567
00:45:12,088 --> 00:45:15,182
Do it with something that does not 
leave tracks.

568
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:20,024
Back-to-school, junior. I'll take 
care of the adults.

569
00:45:20,668 --> 00:45:24,472
Don't go wrong, Earl, just go away.

570
00:46:10,813 --> 00:46:12,373
Hello??? Hello???

571
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:16,756

00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:40,398
It's official, help!

575
00:46:49,033 --> 00:46:51,024
I'm here.

576
00:46:56,865 --> 00:46:59,895
Hey, sweetness. It is all good. Don't 
be afraid.

577
00:46:59,896 --> 00:47:02,059
Do down from there, ok?

578
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,778
Do not be afraid.

579
00:47:04,462 --> 00:47:06,389
I am a police officer. I'm of the 
good.

580
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,108
Hey, good boy.

581
00:47:09,146 --> 00:47:11,217
What mr. Decker, you are doing?!

582
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:15,703
Charlee, is with the bad guys. Tried 
to kill me.

583
00:47:20,284 --> 00:47:21,346
Never hear you coming.

584
00:47:21,347 --> 00:47:23,905
What I don't think you lost the hand, 
huh?

585
00:47:23,906 --> 00:47:25,701
I believe that your yes.

586
00:47:28,472 --> 00:47:31,344
How Charlee, these well?

587
00:47:31,345 --> 00:47:32,642
If.

588
00:47:32,643 --> 00:47:35,910
Is that the way to school?

589
00:47:35,911 --> 00:47:38,114
If.

590
00:47:38,115 --> 00:47:40,239
Well. Stay here.

591
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,169
<-O -> what I will Come to help 
you, ok? <-O -> Good!

00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,781
Make it.

593
00:47:43,782 --> 00:47:45,224
Guys of the devil.

594
00:47:45,868 --> 00:47:49,331
I want the teacher. He killed my 
brother.

595
00:47:49,332 --> 00:47:52,900
Shh, representation in progress.

596
00:47:55,787 --> 00:47:58,936
To be or not to be.

597
00:47:58,937 --> 00:48:01,047
That is the whore.

598
00:48:10,665 --> 00:48:13,327
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty...

599
00:48:34,006 --> 00:48:36,275
Here, kitty, kitten, kittens.

600
00:48:37,431 --> 00:48:39,856
Where are these little kittens?

601
00:48:45,303 --> 00:48:48,122
Come with Mr. Lamb.

602
00:49:44,855 --> 00:49:46,887
Oh fuck!

603
00:49:49,146 --> 00:49:51,113
Oh kitten! Oh kitten!

604
00:49:51,114 --> 00:49:53,657

606
00:49:57,254 --> 00:49:59,811
Do kitten, these well? Do these well?

607
00:49:59,812 --> 00:50:01,175
Oh fuck!

608
00:50:04,614 --> 00:50:06,423
I never have a damn son.

609
00:50:06,424 --> 00:50:08,156
I Fight Viktor! I fight in the ass!

610
00:50:08,157 --> 00:50:10,385

00:50:21,382 --> 00:50:24,570
Kitten, no, no. We have an 
appointment with a big truck now!

613
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:26,773
Hey, and what about me? You need my 
help.

614
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,622
I am sure that we will be able to 
arreglarnoslas without you.

615
00:50:28,623 --> 00:50:31,103
Who just to save your ass, kitten?

616
00:50:31,104 --> 00:50:33,056
Hey, your.

617
00:50:35,002 --> 00:50:36,850
Get your own kitten.

618
00:50:36,851 --> 00:50:39,330
Stay here. Make sure that the boys 
didn't go and...

619
00:50:39,331 --> 00:50:41,652
be careful with the other leg.

620
00:50:41,653 --> 00:50:43,055
Yes!

621
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,864
I can go all out.

622
00:50:45,865 --> 00:50:47,280
<-O->Shh. <-O->Oh.

623
00:50:47,281 --> 00:50:49,642
Good shot, Rambo. Did you hit 
something?

624
00:50:49,643 --> 00:50:52,161
Shut up, I should have given you 
something, man.

625
00:50:52,162 --> 00:50:54,902
<-O->I'm okay with this here. <-O 
-> Where were they?

626
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:04,757
Very well, go away from here,

627
00:51:04,758 --> 00:51:06,567
found a phone and called the state 
police.

628
00:51:06,568 --> 00:51:08,732
<-O->Well. <-O -> ok?

629
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,564
Very well. I'm going to re-enter.

630
00:51:10,565 --> 00:51:12,787
Wait, you can't. They will kill!

631
00:51:12,788 --> 00:51:15,606
Enters the car. Bump, Come On.

632
00:51:16,408 --> 00:51:20,344
What mr. Decker, why it is going to 
risk his skin for them?

633
00:51:20,345 --> 00:51:22,455
They do not do the same for you.

634
00:51:23,296 --> 00:51:25,092
They are my responsibility.

635
00:51:28,964 --> 00:51:31,193
what is it worth? We will.

636
00:51:58,642 --> 00:52:00,241
Give me the keys.

637
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,587
Now, open the door.

638
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:06,198
Salt.

639
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:08,560
Come on! It here! I move around!

640
00:52:08,561 --> 00:52:10,370
Do you remember what I said I was a 
good boy, huh?

641
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:12,870
Do you know what that means? It means 
that you will not be killed.

642
00:52:12,871 --> 00:52:14,805
It comes on the luggage rack!

643
00:52:21,353 --> 00:52:23,621
<-O->Thank You. <-O->Oh, No why.

644
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,145
<-O->Oh, baby, baby. <-O -> Do 
Huh?

645
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:31,279
What am I, or the money?

646
00:52:31,845 --> 00:52:34,861
What am I, or the money?

647
00:52:52,076 --> 00:52:54,383
Time of the show.

648
00:52:59,043 --> 00:53:02,059
Is it one of those false alarms, 
right?

649
00:53:03,176 --> 00:53:05,222
It seems pretty real to me.

650
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,151
Does could talk under please?

651
00:53:07,152 --> 00:53:09,533
Is pissing a watermelon and tell me 
what you feel.

652
00:53:09,534 --> 00:53:12,307
<-O -> oh, you Have a time control 
of shit! <-O -> Oh, Fuck! God!

653
00:53:12,308 --> 00:53:13,842
<-O -> Oh, Fuck! <-O->¡A Joderse!

654
00:53:13,843 --> 00:53:16,106
<-O->Better have a little fucking 
respect. <-O -> Excuse Me?

655
00:53:16,107 --> 00:53:19,177
<-O->This girl is delivery...
Stop, you guys. Oh stop!! Oh stop!!

656
00:53:19,178 --> 00:53:21,735
<-O -> I'm fine, I'm fine! <-O->
Sit, sit.

657
00:53:21,736 --> 00:53:24,036
<-O -> let you beat the shit out 
of! <-O->I Said... what I said?

658
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:25,689
What is it that I said? What is it 
that I said?

659
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:27,736
<-O->Ooh-hoo-hoo. <-O -> oh, Be 
quiet!

660
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:30,634
<-O -> Hey, babe, Thanks! <-O->
Well, no problem.

661
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,191
Why the fuck was that?

662
00:53:34,192 --> 00:53:36,696
Now, since you two have something in 
common.

663
00:53:37,184 --> 00:53:39,387
I you left the fucking nose, man.

664
00:53:39,388 --> 00:53:40,803
Concentrate, man.

665
00:53:40,804 --> 00:53:42,954
They are probably right outside these 
doors.

666
00:55:11,176 --> 00:55:13,444
Break the egg, kitten.

667
00:55:34,438 --> 00:55:36,155
Bingo.

668
00:55:37,823 --> 00:55:39,894
And Bango.

669
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:03,840
Oh, shit! I Mr. Decker! Oh, my God!

670
00:56:03,841 --> 00:56:06,280
What Willy, what the hell are you 
doing here?

671
00:56:06,281 --> 00:56:09,626
Studying in the library... I Am 
trying to get a scholarship.

672
00:56:09,627 --> 00:56:11,397
I didn't think it was so difficult!

673
00:56:11,398 --> 00:56:14,230
The phones are screwed!

674
00:56:14,231 --> 00:56:16,888
The alarms also... I've tried. What 
shit are we going to do?

675
00:56:16,889 --> 00:56:19,958
Willy, if you can get to the main 
connection of telephones,

676
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:23,190
you could reconnect the lines? Do you 
shoot the alarm?

677
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:27,437
Pruebame.

678
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:41,267
Well, Willy.

679
00:56:41,268 --> 00:56:44,179
I will try to get into the auditorium 
through the balcony top.

680
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,793
The connection of the phones is in 
the boiler room.

681
00:56:45,794 --> 00:56:47,905
Can you do it?

682
00:56:49,887 --> 00:56:52,013
Well, it's as easy as falling off the 
stairs.

683
00:56:52,014 --> 00:56:53,966
10.

684
00:56:55,516 --> 00:56:58,585
Look, is without insurance... Is 
charged.

685
00:56:58,586 --> 00:57:01,970
<-O -> do you have your shots, ok? 
<-O->If.

686
00:57:01,971 --> 00:57:03,977
<-O -> What Is Your? <-O->If.

687

<-O->Hmm, good stuff. <-O->If.

How do you feel about shooting 
some... what innocent passers-by?

00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,169
Know how to entertain a girl.

691
00:58:19,904 --> 00:58:21,478
It Haa!

692
00:58:21,479 --> 00:58:24,417
You almost got it, big man.

00:58:28,643 --> 00:58:31,658

00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:34,291
<-O -> I, lord! <-O -> Alice, you

00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:42,654
<-O->Let. <-O->Walk.

<-O -> Alice, you all right? <-O->

700
00:58:45,135 --> 00:58:48,323
Just sit. Do you take you there, ok?

701
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,250
<-O -> what are we to do? <-O->

702
00:58:50,251 --> 00:58:52,992
<-O -> do you Have ammunition in

accident.

703
00:59:04,421 --> 00:59:05,902

704
00:59:07,373 --> 00:59:09,563

outside from there.

709
00:59:21,779 --> 00:59:23,353
The engine room is always closed!

<-O->I can't believe it. <-O ->

731
01:02:30,197 --> 01:02:32,085

739
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:47,691
Mr. Chester,

740
01:03:47,692 --> 01:03:50,644
I have three boys trapped in the gym.

741
01:03:50,645 --> 01:03:53,438
Good! Whoever is still alive

01:03:53,439 --> 01:03:55,353

01:03:56,076 --> 01:03:58,634

brilliant.

744
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:01,060
Come on, the party is over the pool.

745
01:04:02,334 --> 01:04:04,616
Oh shit! Oh shit!

01:04:04,617 --> 01:04:07,135
<-O -> Oh, Fuck! <-O -> oh, Holy

01:04:07,136 --> 01:04:09,182
<-O->Na, na, na, na. <-O -> Oh, 
Cumpa!

748
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:11,840
<-O -> What are you doing here? 
<-O->It's a fucking gun.

749
01:04:11,841 --> 01:04:13,748
<-O->Has covered me. <-O->What we 
know.

750
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:16,110
There was a fight... A motorbike, but 
I...

751
01:04:16,111 --> 01:04:19,181
<-O->Now is what he felt Custer. 
<-O -> Who is Custer?

752
01:04:19,182 --> 01:04:21,069
We should fuck these guys, man.

753
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:23,431
We don't want this in our school.

754
01:04:23,432 --> 01:04:25,202
<-O -> What are you doing? <-O->
Look. Look.

755
01:04:25,203 --> 01:04:26,619
Look at this. Grab a.

756
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:30,634
Glory, go to the room of mechanics, 
please. Brings things.

757
01:04:30,635 --> 01:04:33,275
We're going to bust these fucking 
guys and let's end with this.

758
01:04:36,381 --> 01:04:39,371
Well, listen, there's something you 
should know.

759
01:04:39,372 --> 01:04:41,693
<-O -> What? Ow. <-O->it is not 
only a teacher.

760
01:04:41,694 --> 01:04:43,701
It is an ex-military.

761
01:04:43,702 --> 01:04:46,005
Was in the same elite team, with me 
in Bosnia.

762
01:04:46,006 --> 01:04:47,913
Why didn't you tell me that in the 
first place?

763
01:04:47,914 --> 01:04:50,811
You Fucking Bosnia! "Give me that, 
babe!

764
01:05:04,563 --> 01:05:08,183
<-O -> Hey, Mick, notes! <-O -> 
Oh, Fuck! It Mr. D!

765
01:05:08,184 --> 01:05:11,255
Alejate there... The motion activated 
detonators.

766
01:05:11,256 --> 01:05:15,608
Through these rayois... ¡Boom!!! You 
can see here.

767
01:05:17,474 --> 01:05:18,954
Thanks for the warning.

768
01:05:19,796 --> 01:05:22,668
<-O -> What happened to the others? 
<-O->I don't know.

769
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:25,719
The last time I saw them they were 
going towards the fitness center.

770
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,273
What, then, how do we get out of here?

771
01:05:27,274 --> 01:05:30,736
What you left behind? Do abanDonutste?

772
01:05:30,737 --> 01:05:33,533
It is not my fault they could not 
keep up the pace!

773
01:05:33,534 --> 01:05:37,979
Well. Am I scared, ok?

774
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:40,682
Just give me a break!

775
01:05:45,931 --> 01:05:47,740
I'm a cowardly fuck!

776
01:05:47,741 --> 01:05:51,086
My old man has reason.

777
01:05:51,087 --> 01:05:52,805
It is not surprising that it has gone.

778
01:05:54,827 --> 01:05:56,361
Hey, Mick, Come On.

779
01:05:56,362 --> 01:05:58,486
It is okay that you are afraid of.

780
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:01,281
It means that you still want to live.

781
01:06:01,282 --> 01:06:03,603
What are you afraid of?

782
01:06:03,604 --> 01:06:05,965
There is No time to think about that 
now.

783
01:06:05,966 --> 01:06:09,492
If you don't help, those guys will be 
killed!

784
01:06:10,138 --> 01:06:12,518
<-O -> let Your friends! <-O -> 
What am I supposed to do?

785
01:06:12,519 --> 01:06:14,506
What the two of us against those 
hijoputas?

786
01:06:14,507 --> 01:06:16,355
Shhh. It is as I told you in the 
class.

787
01:06:16,356 --> 01:06:18,855
The side that creates in your case is 
the one that wins.

788
01:06:18,856 --> 01:06:20,961
Yeah, I think they have more weapons.

789
01:06:20,962 --> 01:06:23,599
And really, I think, that they will 
come and will kick our fucking asses!

790
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,448
Then, we will have to match the bets.

791
01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:27,717
How?

792
01:06:30,762 --> 01:06:32,125
Shield.

793
01:06:51,269 --> 01:06:52,881
Have you seen something?

794
01:06:52,882 --> 01:06:54,600
Is too calm.

795
01:06:56,622 --> 01:06:58,589
Do you know how to shoot one of these?

796
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:03,076
<-O->No, man. Not archery. <-S -> 
And do I do?

797
01:07:03,077 --> 01:07:05,345
Have you ever killed someone?

798
01:07:07,564 --> 01:07:09,951
That is a good question.

799
01:07:32,873 --> 01:07:35,313
<-O -> Oh, Duck! <-O -> Let's Go! 
I walk!

800
01:07:35,314 --> 01:07:37,699
I break up! Let's go, let's go!

801
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,735
Oh Viktor!

802
01:07:43,736 --> 01:07:45,965
Oh Viktor!

803
01:07:46,098 --> 01:07:47,697
O Lamb!

804
01:07:58,339 --> 01:07:59,322

01:08:02,551 --> 01:08:04,872
I Presionalo! I Presionalo!

807
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:06,433
Beware!

808
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:13,373
Yes!

809
01:08:13,374 --> 01:08:15,263
Beware! Beware!

810
01:08:15,264 --> 01:08:17,388
Come on!

811
01:08:17,389 --> 01:08:19,382
Ah!

812
01:08:21,916 --> 01:08:24,827

816
01:08:58,175 --> 01:08:59,984
<-O -> oh, we trap the son of a 
bitch! ¡Whoo! <-O->Let. Walk.

817
01:08:59,985 --> 01:09:01,677
Oh Yeah! ¡Whoo!

818
01:09:01,678 --> 01:09:03,907
I Whoo-hoo!

819
01:09:08,487 --> 01:09:10,061
What the hell is happening?

820
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:12,890
What those guys are starting to adapt 
too quickly, don't you think?

821
01:09:14,981 --> 01:09:16,895
What now?

822
01:09:17,816 --> 01:09:20,280
Give me the intercom.

823
01:09:30,883 --> 01:09:33,558
<-O -> Hello??? <-O -> Hello??? 
What Margo Conroy?

824
01:09:33,559 --> 01:09:35,527

01:09:35,528 --> 01:09:38,912

01:09:38,913 --> 01:09:43,084
Has been an incident... involving 
your boyfriend,

827
01:09:43,085 --> 01:09:44,737
Sam Decker.

828
01:09:44,738 --> 01:09:46,490
If, in High school, the Lincoln 
Memorial.

829
01:09:46,491 --> 01:09:49,559
It is important that you meet with me 
immediately.

830
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,295
<-O -> Is it an emergency? <-O->
Oh, yes, a total emergency.

831
01:09:52,296 --> 01:09:56,191
I'll be in the back. Perfect.

832
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,844

01:10:07,016 --> 01:10:10,401
What are you talking about? Do we

837
01:10:10,402 --> 01:10:12,131
<-O -> We've fucked! <-O->Not...

838
01:10:12,132 --> 01:10:15,463
until each one of you, has come out.

839
01:10:23,272 --> 01:10:24,950
Here.

840
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:29,121
We will.

841
01:10:30,632 --> 01:10:32,743
Cares back.

842
01:10:54,366 --> 01:10:57,475
What, then, is you the detectivo who 
was talking about Sam?

843
01:10:57,476 --> 01:11:00,820
<-O->No, I'm more than a little 
perturbed.

844
01:11:00,821 --> 01:11:03,223
<-O -> But I was the one who 
called! <-O -> Oh God!

845
01:11:03,224 --> 01:11:05,962
I walk! That's it. Turn to the right.

846
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:09,094
Good girl. Watch where you're going.

847
01:11:14,266 --> 01:11:16,691
Hi, like these?

848
01:11:19,343 --> 01:11:21,311
Guys, guys, guys,

849
01:11:21,312 --> 01:11:24,322
this is the most black of the black 
sheep, Chester Lamb.

850
01:11:24,323 --> 01:11:28,200
Coming to you live from Radio Free 
high school Lincoln,

851
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:30,758
and we have a show of rock for you.

852
01:11:30,759 --> 01:11:33,498
But, before that, we have a...

853
01:11:34,575 --> 01:11:38,000
and I want to say a very special 
guest.

854
01:11:38,001 --> 01:11:40,500
Directly from the center of the city 
without comparison.

855
01:11:40,501 --> 01:11:41,895
Baby, sweetness, sweetie,

856
01:11:41,896 --> 01:11:44,598
say something to the guy in the 
trenches.

857
01:11:47,013 --> 01:11:49,848
Very well, Sam. Have your package 
beautiful: Margo.

858
01:11:49,849 --> 01:11:52,208
Your Dalilah, live in the studio.

859
01:11:52,209 --> 01:11:56,917
But by how much? That entirely 
depends on you.

860
01:11:57,681 --> 01:12:00,338
So, what happened, Sammy? Do you want 
to choose door number one?

861
01:12:00,339 --> 01:12:02,698
You go home as a winner, and not as a 
sinner.

862
01:12:02,699 --> 01:12:04,331
Some beautiful present of farewell.

863
01:12:04,332 --> 01:12:07,466
Do you want to or not? Of course, we 
want.

864
01:12:19,053 --> 01:12:21,045
Then...

865
01:12:22,398 --> 01:12:23,696
Here are some incentive.

866
01:12:23,697 --> 01:12:26,530
We will return to the revolver,

867
01:12:26,531 --> 01:12:29,916
a sound... With a bullet, so to speak.

868
01:12:29,917 --> 01:12:31,909
We're going to spin this.

869
01:12:38,851 --> 01:12:41,527
What thou hast heard that Sam?

870
01:12:41,528 --> 01:12:44,150
Beginner luck.

871
01:12:47,156 --> 01:12:48,677
The corridor is free.

872
01:12:51,289 --> 01:12:54,541
Very well, I will verify for myself.

873
01:12:55,816 --> 01:12:57,153
To hell with you, Mr. Decker.

874
01:12:57,154 --> 01:12:58,609
Now look, Sam.

875
01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:02,467
The be hamf-breed is a great job, and 
I love to be.

876
01:13:02,468 --> 01:13:04,907
But you want your little friend to 
pieces,

877
01:13:04,908 --> 01:13:07,210
encuentrame in my cabinet as soon as 
possible.

878
01:13:07,211 --> 01:13:09,538
<-O -> oh, Sam, do not listen! <-O 
-> Shut Up!

879
01:13:15,693 --> 01:13:18,393
Come On, Sam. Do not be an obstacle.

880
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:23,863
Hey, Sam!

881
01:13:36,317 --> 01:13:37,616
Sorry, friend.

882
01:13:37,617 --> 01:13:39,583
All those years we served together

883
01:13:39,584 --> 01:13:41,709
we follow the rules and look what 
that got her, huh?

884
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:43,953
You are a teacher dead.

885
01:13:43,954 --> 01:13:46,536
I'm a damn police in the street.

886
01:14:07,373 --> 01:14:09,602
Now you're a fucking police officer 
dead.

887
01:14:12,962 --> 01:14:14,639
Greetings.

888
01:14:21,031 --> 01:14:23,771
Well, again to the party.

889
01:14:26,187 --> 01:14:28,258
<-O->One for you...

890
01:14:29,493 --> 01:14:31,722
and one for me.

891
01:14:33,114 --> 01:14:35,501
<-O->Two for you.

892
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:42,546
<-O->come on, boys, walk on. <-O -> 
Oh God!

893
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:48,779
Okay, walk!

894
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:51,180
<-O->Listen carefully.

895
01:14:51,181 --> 01:14:55,456
<-O->Listen carefully.

896
01:14:55,983 --> 01:14:58,146
Oh Ooh-ooh-ooh! ¡Ahh!

897
01:14:58,147 --> 01:14:59,839
I will go to the cafeteria.

898
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,453
Go to the room of calders, and you 
will be able to get out.

899
01:15:01,454 --> 01:15:03,067
Mr. Decker, don't let up.

900
01:15:03,068 --> 01:15:06,177
<-O->Mr. Decker, it's ridiculous. 
<-O->We have to do this together.

901
01:15:06,178 --> 01:15:08,248
I just do what I tell you!

902
01:15:10,113 --> 01:15:11,790
Wow!

903
01:15:14,049 --> 01:15:16,947
The boiler room is down the hall 
don't get to get to the bottom.

904
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,872
Oh Ow!

905
01:15:43,688 --> 01:15:46,821
We're going to walk Out of here. 
Let's go, move!

906
01:15:47,899 --> 01:15:49,774
Come on!

907
01:15:51,284 --> 01:15:52,267
Hey, thanks, Mick.

908
01:15:52,268 --> 01:15:54,497
<-O->I owe You one. <-O->Now, 
walk, Go.

909
01:16:02,383 --> 01:16:04,101
That costs you, Sam.

910
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:12,144
Walk. Go, go, go.

911
01:16:12,145 --> 01:16:14,741
<-O->Walk. We will. <-O->Rapido, 
come on.

912
01:16:14,742 --> 01:16:17,103
Let's go, let's go!

913
01:16:17,104 --> 01:16:19,215
Are you ok?

914
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:37,596
Hey, the secret service is?

915
01:16:39,107 --> 01:16:41,231
If, listen, change of plans.

916
01:16:41,232 --> 01:16:43,199
I have the material.

917
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:46,767
Send a helicopter to the roof as fast 
as possible.

918
01:16:47,294 --> 01:16:48,710
How much?

919
01:16:48,711 --> 01:16:51,333
Most of what you need, idiot.

920
01:16:52,568 --> 01:16:54,338
I'm on the way.

921
01:16:54,339 --> 01:16:57,670
No matter what you want nothing is 
worth the price of all this.

922
01:16:59,968 --> 01:17:02,787
What's not worth it?

923
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:05,163
Oh baby, if you can see him with my 
eyes

924
01:17:05,164 --> 01:17:07,327
you'd know that is a blow of dream.

925
01:17:07,328 --> 01:17:09,807
And I had everything planned out, too.

926
01:17:09,808 --> 01:17:11,578
Tick tock, we're in the school.

927
01:17:11,579 --> 01:17:13,940
Tick tock, bring the truck.

928
01:17:13,941 --> 01:17:17,128
Tick tock, it explodes that shit.

929
01:17:17,129 --> 01:17:21,380
And when each individual makes to 
respect the law, in this city, 
mobilize,

930
01:17:21,381 --> 01:17:24,844
partiriamos on our own and custom 
vehicle police.

931
01:17:24,845 --> 01:17:28,228
A fortune in Heroin, and no one, 
neither the wiser to know.

932
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:32,911
But, thanks to your boyfriend, those 
children busybodies

933
01:17:32,912 --> 01:17:35,509
and those idiots from eastern Europe,

934
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:38,186
everything has been food for dogs!

935
01:17:38,187 --> 01:17:40,430
Then, you understand

936
01:17:40,431 --> 01:17:42,895
if I'm a bit angry!

937
01:17:44,602 --> 01:17:47,396
Well, look at that is the case.

938
01:17:47,397 --> 01:17:50,329
The phone line... The alarms are 
going for here.

939
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:52,868
I can deal with this. What fuck is 
that?

940
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:55,071
<-O -> Oh, shit! <-O -> What?

941
01:17:55,072 --> 01:17:58,850
Oh nothing, you know. Just a little 
bit of explosive C-4, nothing more.

942
01:17:58,851 --> 01:18:00,936
Oh God!

943
01:18:00,937 --> 01:18:03,732
<-O->We have three minutes. <-O->
Not, not, not moving.

944
01:18:03,733 --> 01:18:05,896
This activated by remote control, man.

945
01:18:05,897 --> 01:18:08,847
<-O -> Can you take them apart? 
<-O->Acercame, acercame.

946
01:18:08,848 --> 01:18:11,116
You're a guy ready.

947
01:18:15,855 --> 01:18:17,861
What about a remote control like this?

948
01:18:17,862 --> 01:18:19,514
Oh, but don't worry,

949
01:18:19,515 --> 01:18:23,003
not viviras when this explodes.

950
01:18:25,459 --> 01:18:27,386
Are you going to dispararnos and 
volarnos?

951
01:18:27,387 --> 01:18:29,669
You are a fucking cold blooded!

952
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:32,070
The world is cold.

953
01:18:32,071 --> 01:18:33,290
Please, look, I'm pregnant.

954
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:34,943
<-O->Only do not kill my baby. 
<-O->Calmate, relax.

955
01:18:34,944 --> 01:18:38,826
Oh, look on the positive side. You 
won't need social assistance.

956
01:18:41,636 --> 01:18:44,258
<-O -> Let Hogie! It Hogie! <-O -> 
let Hogie, not!

957
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,271
<-O -> oh, No, No! <-O -> Oh, 
Shit!

958
01:18:59,112 --> 01:19:00,882
Friend, friend.

959
01:19:00,883 --> 01:19:04,843
"Give me the alarm! It's Jay Tee, I'm 
going to turn off the alarm!

960
01:19:11,156 --> 01:19:13,045
Attention, Sam.

961
01:19:13,046 --> 01:19:16,272
The next sound you hear will be your 
brains out of your girl

962
01:19:16,273 --> 01:19:19,683
in the soup of the day.

963
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:24,838
What a fuck!

964
01:19:30,206 --> 01:19:33,577
Sam, I'm looking into your eyes.

965
01:19:34,694 --> 01:19:36,464
This is between you and me.

966
01:19:36,465 --> 01:19:39,441
Do you really, want to see it dead, 
too?

967
01:19:41,149 --> 01:19:43,102
Sam...

968
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:51,971
Yes! Yes!

969
01:19:51,972 --> 01:19:54,333
Shut up!

970
01:19:54,334 --> 01:19:57,862
The firefighters and the police are 
already on their way, I promise!

971
01:20:03,742 --> 01:20:05,472
<-O->Hogie, you'll be fine. <-O->
Hogie, hold.

972
01:20:05,473 --> 01:20:07,440
You're going to do it, man.

973
01:20:07,441 --> 01:20:09,211
Oh God!

974
01:20:09,212 --> 01:20:10,629
Oh shit! Beware!

975
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:13,173
Oh shit!

976
01:20:22,162 --> 01:20:23,696
It's countdown!

977
01:20:23,697 --> 01:20:25,847
It is because she has pressed the 
button, man!

978
01:20:27,436 --> 01:20:29,074
It last chance, Sam!

979
01:20:30,074 --> 01:20:32,159
Oh fuck, move!

980
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,876
Oh God!

981
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:55,106
Come On, Willy!

982
01:20:55,107 --> 01:20:58,279
Well, Well. I have to think. I have 
to think.

983
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,190
¡Last chance!

984
01:21:02,228 --> 01:21:05,731
It is really going to expel me this 
time!

985
01:21:05,732 --> 01:21:08,013
I hold, Mr. D, has Already arrived!

986

I'm going to burst at this hamf-breed!

988
01:21:14,037 --> 01:21:15,689
What is the problem?

989
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:18,115
<-O -> what is the problem? <-O -> 
50 seconds, friend!

990
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:23,522

01:21:23,523 --> 01:21:25,962
20, 19...

992
01:21:25,963 --> 01:21:28,088

01:21:35,134 --> 01:21:37,691
Maybe, just... <-O->Press the 
button.

996
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:39,266
What?

997
01:21:39,267 --> 01:21:41,299
I pressed the button!

998
01:21:41,432 --> 01:21:43,084
Does the main cable, correct?

999
01:21:43,085 --> 01:21:44,920
<-O -> Do It! <-O -> Oh, Shit!

1000
01:21:49,225 --> 01:21:52,097
