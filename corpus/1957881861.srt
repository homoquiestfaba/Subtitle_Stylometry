00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,200
[music playing]

2
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,960
 I'm glad you came over.

3
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,280
I wasn't sure where things
stood with us anymore.

4
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,560
 What's that supposed to mean?

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,200
 Well, the things you said
to me last time I saw you.

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,480
It made me feel like you
didn't believe in me anymore.

7
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,960
 Should I believe
in you, Stephen?

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,920
 Yeah, you should.

9
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,680
Otherwise, what's the point?

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,720
You know, don't you?

11
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,560
[gunshots]

12
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,720
 And now take a
good look around.

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,960
Statistics tell us that of
this class of 22, five of you

14
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,360
will become exemplary
police officers.

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,360
Nine more will stick it
out and collect a pension.

16
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:40,640
The remaining eight will find it
too tough and you'll wash out.

17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,400
If you want to become
one of the best,

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,240
it's your humanity which
will set you apart.

19
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,000
Just remember that you are now
members of a police department

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,040
which is 50 years older
than the Constitution

21
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,800
of the United States.

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,920
Serve it with pride.

23
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,280
[cheering]

24
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,840
 Congratulations.

25
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,560
- Congratulations.
- Hey.

26
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,520
 Hey, darling.
Look at this stray I found here.

27
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,400
 Uh-huh.

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,520
 Uh-huh.

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,800
Oh, have you seen
the kids around?

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,720
 Yeah, they're running
around somewhere.

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,400
 Are they embarrassing me?

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,520
 Oh, yeah.

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,680
So where are your
folks, Stephen?

34
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
 Probably playing golf.

35
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,080
 Stephen's parents
aren't too thrilled

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,360
with his career choice.

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,920
 Here, have something to eat.

38
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,560
 She's beautiful
and she can cook.

39
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,200
 Ah, don't try to
charm me, Stephen Smith.

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,600
STEPHEN: No, ma'am.

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,840
 So you boys looked
mighty handsome up there.

42
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,560
 Honey, you are looking at
two of San Antonio's finest.

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,000
 You anxious to get started?

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,600
 So long as I don't have
to patrol the neighborhood

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,560
I grew up in.

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,120
 It wouldn't be so bad.

47
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,160
 In Alamo Heights, a
cop is a public servant.

48
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,000
In the South Side, a
cop can be somebody.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,800
Command respect.

50
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,560
 Come on.

51
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,960
Look, I told you
I don't know, man.

52
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,800
 I already
volunteered, Farrell.

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,560
If we're gonna be on
this job for 30 years,

54
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,520
I want it to mean something.

55
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,880
Don't you?

56
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,720
 Yeah, but I've got a
family to think about.

57
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
 Are you with me on this?

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,640
[soft music]

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,800
 Well, it's official now.

60
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,800
My life is one long
string of cops.

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
 Grandaddy and daddy.

62
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,240
 Uncle, cousin.

63
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,760
 And husband.

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,040
 And probably one day my son.

65
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,240
Little rookie Jimmy Dean.

66
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,520
So congratulations, Officer.

67
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,640
 Well, thank you, ma'am.

68
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,520
 Farrell.

69
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,840
FARRELL: Hmm?

70
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,360
 What did Stephen
talk you into today?

71
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,080
 Well, he didn't
exactly twist my arm.

72
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,840
I don't want to spend my
time patrolling shopping

73
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,040
malls in Alamo Heights.

74
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,080
 Doesn't sound so bad to me.

75
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,440
 I want something a
little more than that.

76
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,880
 You don't have to go
looking for trouble.

77
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,960
 Well, if I'm gonna do
it, I want to do it right.

78
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,080
 Oh, I see.

79
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,120
And Stephen thinks
doing it right

80
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,720
is doing it on the South Side.

81
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,640
 Oh, yeah, sure.

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,240
And he's right.

83
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,480
And we're going to
back each other up,

84
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,240
we're going to keep each
other out of trouble,

85
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,800
and we're always going to
be in each other's corner.

86
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Smith and Tucker.

87
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,760
And I'm wanna tell you what,
that sounds like a bad weapon,

88
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,680
doesn't it?

89
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,520
[laughing]

90
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,480
[sirens blaring]

91
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,320
All right, everybody back.

92
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,960
 [crying]

93
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
They just kept shooting.

94
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,760
 Where?
Show me.

95
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,680
Show me.

96
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,600
Show me.

97
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,360
 [crying]

98
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,920
They just kept shooting.

99
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
Shooting each other to pieces!

100
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,760
They wouldn't stop!

101
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,080
They wouldn't stop!

102
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,040
 Got enough weapons
there, Guerrero?

103
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,160
 Mama raised me nervous.

104
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,560
[country music]

105
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,480
 Ah.

106
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,960
So I'm off on a horse.

107
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,600
The guy who runs the stable
starts yelling at him.

108
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,400
Boom, I'm off after
this perpetrator.

109
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,360
 Lone Ranger

110
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,400
 And I'm getting it too.

111
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,320
I'm getting it.

112
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,520
I drew, aimed, ping!

113
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,120
From a gallop, I shot his
horse right in the ass.

114
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,280
I swear, the perpetrator
got thrown 30 feet.

115
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,600
Broke his neck in two places.

116
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,200
Dead all over.

117
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,720
 Man, that's the way
you have to do it.

118
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,000
Improvise.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,120
Do what you gotta do
and let God decide.

120
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,600
 Were you ever reviewed
for improper use

121
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,560
of your weapon, Captain?

122
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,760
 What, are you kidding?

123
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,960
In case you haven't
noticed, Smith,

124
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,800
you're not in the
academy anymore.

125
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,160
Basic rules, my butt.

126
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,880
We are the line of
demarcation between

127
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,280
what happens or doesn't.

128
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,400
 The man's right, buddy.

129
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,040
We cruise alone out there.

130
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,640
It's every man for himself.

131
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,080
 Ask Joey Miller's wife.

132
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,000
She got his folded
flag last week.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,080
 Joey Miller died because
he didn't stay current.

134
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,760
He hardly ever
went to the range.

135
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,160
 Oh, right.

136
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,360
The range.

137
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,080
Target practice.

138
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,520
What the hell do you know
about bad guys, Smitty?

139
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,360
Huh?

140
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,800
Alamo Heights, the cocktail
capital of San Antonio.

141
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,000
What crimes do you ever
see except your neighbors

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,960
cheating on their taxes?

143
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,920
 Lay off, Frank.

144
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,680
 Aw.

145
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,600
You want to hear
something, Smitty?

146
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,360
[shouting on tape]

147
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,680
That's me doing sound effects.

148
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,760
FRANK (ON TAPE):
Come on, get up!

149
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,240
MAN (ON TAPE): [yelling]

150
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,680
FRANK (ON TAPE): Don't
make me hurt you!

151
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,760
MAN (ON TAPE):
[yelling] Stop, please!

152
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,680
FRANK (ON TAPE): So talk!

153
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,000
Come on!

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,920
 And you call that
doing your job.

155
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,720
You call that being
right with your badge,

156
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,920
beating somebody to death.

157
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,240
 Well, no one killed no one.

158
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,320
Do I look like an amateur?

159
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,720
Let's say I had.

160
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,120
Trash like that, it'd be
considered misdemeanor murder.

161
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,440
And you know
something else, Smith?

162
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,920
It'd stay on the street.

163
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,480
It wouldn't bother
nobody upstairs.

164
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,440
What goes down on the
street stays on the street.

165
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
 [clearing throat]
Come on, Frank.

166
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,920
Your old lady's
waiting up for me.

167
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
 Hell, I know that's a lie.

168
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,760
She don't even wait up for me.

169
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,600
Bye bye, Smitty.

170
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,760
 You know, Shifton
is the kind of cop

171
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,720
that give rednecks a bad name.

172
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,400
 No, he's got a point though.

173
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,240
Now, when it comes down
to it, it's either us

174
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,040
or them out there.

175
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,000
 You cannot be buying
into that garbage, Farrell.

176
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
 No, I just had a bad day.

177
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,560
DISPATCH (ON RADIO): At
5th and Grand, a 4 59.

178
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,720
Please respond.

179
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,800
 2 6, I've got it.

180
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,160
[siren blaring]

181
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,680
 Must have fallen asleep
watching television.

182
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,320
I-- I guess I didn't
lock the door.

183
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,120
 What did he take?

184
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,520
 I don't know.

185
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,000
Nothing.

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,280
 Did you hear him and wake up?

187
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,240
 [sighing]

188
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,240
 Did you get a look at him?

189
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,680
Lucinda, I can't help you
unless you answer my questions.

190
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,040
 [crying]

191
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,520
He raped me.

192
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,120
 I'm sorry, Lucinda.

193
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,880
I'm really sorry.

194
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,680
Can you identify him?

195
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,160
 I know him from work.

196
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,880
 What's his name?

197
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,320
Where's he live?

198
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,760
 Please don't tell my father!

199
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,200
Don't tell my father!

200
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,520
[crying]

201
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,400
[banging]

202
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,200
 I'm looking for
Edward Burkett.

203
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,520
Is he home?

204
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,360
 No, is there some kind
of trouble, Officer?

205
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,320
 Do you know where he's at?

206
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,520
 He's not home.

207
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,800
 Mind if I have a look around?

208
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,280
Are you Burkett?

209
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,920
 You can't barge in here, man.

210
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,640
 You're under arrest
for sexual assault.

211
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,160
You have the right
to remain silent.

212
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,440
If you choose to
give up that right--

213
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,360
 You crazy, man.

214
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,480
You messed up good.

215
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,440
 You're a big man, Eddie.

216
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,680
You're a real big man.

217
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,640
It takes a big man
to do what you did.

218
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,080
 I didn't do nothing.

219
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,840
She begged me to do it.

220
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,200
I was doing her a favor.

221
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,600
You messed up good, man.

222
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,120
I ain't even gonna need
a lawyer on this one.

223
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Well, I got me a witness.

224
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,120
Ain't that right, Ma?

225
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,880
 Let's go.

226
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,760
 You break into his
home without a warrant,

227
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,520
then you conduct an
illegal interrogation,

228
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,920
and then you strike
a handcuffed suspect

229
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,960
while his mother looks on.

230
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,880
My god, Smith.

231
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,960
Do you have a screw loose?

232
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,440
 He baited me, sir.

233
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,840
 That's because he knows
the law better than you do.

234
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,400
 Will he walk, sir?

235
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,680
 Will he walk.

236
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,320
Are you kidding?

237
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,000
He's already back
out on the street!

238
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,840
 I'm very sorry, sir.

239
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,600
 Well-- well, I can
sincerely believe that.

240
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,560
 Thank you, sir.

241
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,560
 But, Smith, I want you to know
that I've got enough cowboys

242
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,280
out on the street as it is.

243
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,880
I don't need another one.

244
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,640
 Yes, sir.

245
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,120
 What did he say?

246
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,520
 I'm on probation.

247
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
 So you're still on patrol.

248
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,160
It could have been worse.

249
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,640
 I'm on probation, and Eddie
Burkett, who is guilty as sin,

250
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,800
is a free man!

251
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
 Well.

252
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,640
Maybe in God's eyes he's guilty.

253
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,120
But a man ain't guilty
till a jury says he is.

254
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,720
3-2, crowded plate.

255
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,840
Go ahead, whiff it
on by her-- oh, god!

256
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,720
Strike three.

257
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,640
She is out, gone, goodbye.

258
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,920
 So, Stephen,
when are you going

259
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,400
to find yourself
some nice gal and get

260
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,800
married and have some
kids of your own?

261
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,240
 Oh, I'll know
her when I see her.

262
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,800
Every day, every other street
corner I say to myself,

263
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
today I'm going to arrest her
and I'm going to know she's

264
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,960
the one.

265
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,120
 Don't you talk that way.

266
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,440
 There's one fact that still
eludes you about women, honcho.

267
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,280
STEPHEN: I'm sure you're
gonna enlighten me, partner.

268
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,560
 Most of 'em like furniture.

269
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,920
 Oh, Stephen.

270
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,160
Do you still only have
a-- a bed and a table?

271
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,600
 Own not, want not.

272
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,480
 You're on a long and
lonely road, buddy.

273
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,400
You better buy some lamps
before it's too late.

274
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,520
 Take this home with you
and call it a starter set.

275
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,920
FARRELL: No, no, no, no,
not my favorite chair.

276
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,360
 Look at him.

277
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,120
 You call it.

278
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,040
 Draw.

279
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,880
[gunshots]

280
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,120
Damn, don't you ever get rusty?

281
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,400
 Wearing a badge is the
best job in the world,

282
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,960
but it don't mean
diddly if you're dead.

283
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,560
Which reminds me, partner.

284
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,200
I've seen you come off your
shift without your vest on.

285
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,280
 I sweat like a
pig in that thing.

286
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,640
 All right.

287
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,120
This time you're gonna
do it with your ticket

288
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,280
book in your hand.

289
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,560
 [chuckling] No,
go ahead, hot shot.

290
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,360
I'll time you.

291
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,720
On the gun.

292
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,440
[gunshots]

293
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,920
1.9 seconds.

294
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
Pretty damn good
shooting, buddy.

295
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,320
[glass shattering]

296
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
 Hurry up!

297
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,480
Hurry up!

298
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,440
 What's going on?

299
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,600
 They're killing each other!

300
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,520
You gotta stop 'em, please!

301
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,800
Hurry!

302
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,120
 Ma'am, I want you
to calm yourself down.

303
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,000
I'll take care of the problem.

304
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,840
[shouting]

305
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,800
WOMAN: Stop it!

306
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,680
 All right, break it up.

307
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
[shouting]

308
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,240
Break it up, I said.

309
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,080
[grunting]

310
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,440
Gentlemen, break it up.

311
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,840
We're gonna settle this
in a civilized fashion.

312
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,600
[shouting]

313
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,840
I said break it up!

314
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,760
[glass shattering]

315
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,240
WOMAN: Stop it!

316
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,160
Stop it!

317
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,200
Stop it!

318
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,480
 Horton, give me
that right now!

319
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,360
Give me that!

320
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,440
 Stop it!

321
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,400
Stop it, no!

322
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
You're killing him!

323
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,360
You wanna kill a cop?

324
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,280
Get away!

325
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,640
Come on, get off.

326
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,520
[doorbell ringing]

327
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,600
BETH: Farrell,
will you get that?

328
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,400
 Yeah.

329
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,640
Hey-- what the hell
happened to you, man?

330
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,400
Were you in a wreck?

331
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,280
 Domestic dispute.

332
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,120
 Come in.

333
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,160
Do you want a
drink or something?

334
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,400
 No, I'm full of painkiller.

335
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,120
I had to come here.

336
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,520
I wanted you to
hear this from me.

337
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,480
 Domestic dispute.

338
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,400
What are you talking about?

339
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,680
 They were animals.

340
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,920
They didn't give a
damn that I was a cop.

341
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,680
Farrell.

342
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,920
The got my gun.

343
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,720
 They took your weapon?

344
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,640
A domestic dispute?

345
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,520
What the hell did
we become cops for?

346
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,600
You take an oath, you put your
life on the line for what?

347
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,760
Marriage counseling!

348
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,800
 Hey, hey.

349
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
 Look at this!

350
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,720
STEPHEN: Take it easy, partner.

351
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,160
 No, the hell I will.

352
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,440
Am I wrong, or shouldn't you
be a little PO about this?

353
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,240
 You're not wrong.

354
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,640
[game beeping]
- Good shot.

355
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,520
Good shot.

356
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,440
Good shot.

357
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,040
Oh.

358
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,560
[laughing]

359
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,920
You missed.

360
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,880
You missed.

361
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,640
 I think he's just Superman!

362
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,360
LEA: Food's ready.

363
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,280
 Good shot.

364
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,400
[laughing]

365
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,880
STEPHEN: All right, all right.

366
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,080
OK.

367
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,200
 Why do you all
come in here at 8:00?

368
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,760
You never been in here before.

369
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,360
 Oh, you know, we
usually eat doughnuts.

370
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,520
But, uh, my partner here, he
saw you through the window.

371
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,120
Once he got a look at you,
well, I couldn't keep him away.

372
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,560
 Well, if he come
in here to see me,

373
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,200
he ain't made much point of it.

374
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,320
 Well, you see, he's very shy.

375
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,200
And he was sort of hoping that
you would, um, break the ice.

376
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,400
LEA: Oh, yeah?

377
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,200
 Oh, yeah.

378
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,160
 Ka-boom!

379
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,800
 Hmm.

380
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,760
 No better kick in
the butt than watching

381
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,560
those little cowboys fall.

382
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,520
 Oh, damn.

383
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,720
[laughing] Let's see, uh,
could you get me some napkins?

384
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,400
I think she's got
some napkins up there.

385
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,160
 You know, if you'd slow down,
that wouldn't happen, Farrell.

386
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,040
Can I get some napkins, please?

387
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,800
 You bet.

388
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,800
Here you go.

389
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,400
I hope these will be enough.

390
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
 For Sloppy Joe over
there, I don't know.

391
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,320
 Is there something
else, Officer?

392
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,480
 Excuse me, I don't
mean to be rude.

393
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,160
Uh, if I'm on the wrong track,
you just set me straight.

394
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,640
But do I remind you of somebody?

395
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,920
 No.

396
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,360
Are you somebody?

397
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,920
 Stephen.

398
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,400
Hey, would you bring me some
napkins over here, please?

399
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,320
 Oh, you're a Stephen.

400
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
Uh-huh.

401
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,680
[laughing]

402
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
MAN: A large soda and an
extra mashed potatoes.

403
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,160
 OK, sir.

404
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,320
That's a two-piece
chicken dinner,

405
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,640
side of slaw, extra
mashed potatoes,

406
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,040
large Coke, and a fried--

407
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,920
[gun cocking]

408
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,080
 Up!

409
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,240
[woman screaming]

410
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,840
Shut up!
- Hey, man.

411
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,120
Take it easy, all right.

412
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,600
You can have whatever
cash we have, OK?

413
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,520
Just take it easy.

414
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,640
 In here, now.

415
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,400
Now!

416
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,320
You too.

417
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,080
 OK.

418
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
[woman crying]

419
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
 OK, OK.

420
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Don't push.

421
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,400
 Take it easy.

422
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,760
 I think he--

423
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,880
I think he went around back.

424
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,160
 Smitty, perp's
coming out the back.

425
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,080
Down!

426
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,440
 You in the coat, stop!

427
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,840
Police officer.
Stop!

428
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,120
 It's not me, man.

429
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,640
 Drop what you're holding.

430
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,280
Clasp your hands
behind your head.

431
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,240
Clasp your hands
behind your head!

432
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,680
[gunshots]

433
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,120
 Right back here.

434
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,240
[police radio chatter]

435
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,000
Close up.

436
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,160
[siren blaring]

437
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,400
 Patrolman Smith.

438
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,320
I'm Detective Sergeant
Nicholas, Homicide.

439
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,040
 Yes, sir.

440
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,360
 How are you doing?

441
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,200
 I'm doing all right, sir.

442
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,920
 Patrolman Castro tells me
that you fired all six shots.

443
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,400
 That's right, sir.

444
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
 Well, you hit him with five.

445
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,680
That's pretty good shooting.

446
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,160
 He didn't seem to
want to go down, sir.

447
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,480
 Now, why don't you go on home?

448
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,000
You can finish your
report in the morning.

449
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,800
I'm gonna need your gun.

450
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,640
 Thank you very much.

451
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,680
 Thank you, sir.

452
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,240
 I talked to the
manager and it definitely

453
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,920
sounds like a right to shoot.

454
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,960
 That's good.

455
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,600
 How's Smith?

456
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,320
 Hanging pretty tough for a
guy who just lost his cherry.

457
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,840
Patrol, this is 10 Henry 4.

458
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,200
 Hey, a blanket out of the car.

459
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,040
Stephen, you all right?

460
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,080
 Yeah, I think so.

461
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,880
I think.

462
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,960
I mean, Farrell, I
can't even remember

463
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,680
too much of what happened.

464
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,840
Castro and a civilian
witness are saying that it

465
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,600
was a justifiable shooting.

466
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,720
 Damn right.

467
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,040
Empty your gun.

468
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,320
Now, you did what you
had to do, Stephen.

469
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,280
 Yeah?

470
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,240
 Yeah.

471
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,120
 Yeah, I did.

472
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,640
 In the, uh, past
year, there were

473
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,040
190 murders in San Antonio.

474
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,920
That's an increase of more
than 25% over last year.

475
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,920
 We keep our own
statistics, Ms. Burroughs.

476
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,440
 Well, in that
same period, there

477
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,560
were at least 40 formal
complaints of police brutality

478
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,600
and 12 confirmed
shootings of civilians

479
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,200
by San Antonio police officers.

480
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,080
 I told your editor that I
would answer some questions.

481
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,800
Do you have any
questions, ma'am?

482
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,200
 Well, I--

483
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,920
I have to question whether
the police force is

484
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,960
making things better or worse.

485
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,480
 Uh, Ms. Burroughs.

486
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,880
Where are you from?

487
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,360
 New York City.

488
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,520
Does it matter?

489
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,920
 Well, New York
is a vertical city.

490
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,440
San Antonio is a
horizontal city.

491
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,120
And it's a huge area
for a relatively

492
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,600
small police force to patrol.

493
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,720
Well, it's very simple.

494
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,560
If the taxpayers are willing to
give us enough money to blanket

495
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,360
the street with patrolmen,
we'll cut down on the violence

496
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,760
substantially.

497
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,520
But I don't think
that's going to happen.

498
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,720
So we do the best
dang job we can

499
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,760
do with the resources we have.

500
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,040
 Well, what about
the police shootings?

501
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,400
Our sources tell us that
patrolmen are carrying caches

502
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,240
of their own weapons around.

503
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,880
 If a police officer is caught
with unauthorized weapons

504
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,520
in a department vehicle,
the first time he--

505
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,560
he or she will be reprimanded.

506
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,320
The next time, he or
she will be suspended.

507
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,720
That is department policy.

508
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,280
I am not going to let San
Antonio become Dodge City.

509
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,320
 Well, there's nothing
like a good love story.

510
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,280
 That's right, a
man and his gun.

511
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,960
 Is that really what
it's like to be a cop?

512
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,600
 Oh, no way.

513
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,520
Mostly we find lost kids and
we feed them ice cream cones.

514
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,200
 Officer, I think these
people were jaywalking.

515
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
 Freeze!

516
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,120
Get in the car.

517
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,680
 See, when you're
old married folks,

518
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,800
you gotta open your own doors.

519
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,480
 What do you mean married?

520
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,520
 Oh, you.

521
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,720
 Take it easy back there.

522
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,080
I'm watching you.

523
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,200
I want to see two pairs
of hands at all times.

524
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,880
 Ooh.

525
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,440
Well, Officer, is that a gun,
or you just enjoy my company?

526
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,960
[laughing]

527
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,880
 Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

528
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,280
 You keep your eyes on
the road there, partner.

529
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,000
 I can't drive with you
all over him like that.

530
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,400
[grunting]

531
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,120
[sirens approaching]

532
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,400
 Keep your mouth shut, old man.

533
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,760
Thanks for the loan.

534
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,360
 All right, everything's
going to be all right.

535
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,480
You're going to be all right.

536
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,960
I want you to just
think now, OK?

537
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,200
And I want you to try to
tell me what he looks like.

538
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,400
2 6.

539
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,160
2 4, go to channel eight.

540
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,080
STEPHEN (ON RADIO):
Nothing here.

541
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,640
 Why don't you do-si-do
up my way, kemosabe?

542
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,720
STEPHEN (ON RADIO): And
where might that be?

543
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,000
 I'm in South Military.

544
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,120
Looks like we got
ourselves a winner, buddy.

545
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,200
Just hold on a second.

546
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,680
I want to talk to you.

547
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,760
 You, uh, got a
warrant or something?

548
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,480
 How about you got
an ID or something?

549
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,840
 Listen, man.

550
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,320
You can't just stop the
citizen in the street.

551
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,760
 That's a nice brown jacket.

552
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,440
Expensive.

553
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,000
Turquoise earring,
very hard to forget.

554
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,560
Now, let's see the ID right now.

555
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,400
Take it out.

556
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,760
 [laughing]

557
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
Spread 'em!

558
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,760
Put your hands behind your back!

559
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,120
I said put them behind
your back, right now!

560
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
Come on, boy, now!

561
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,200
PERP: Show me how tough you are.

562
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
 I ain't fooling with you!

563
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,760
Put 'em back!

564
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,920
You showed that old man how
tough you are, didn't you?

565
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,080
Didn't you!

566
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,080
 What do I know about old men?

567
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,160
[laughing]

568
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,960
 Farrell.

569
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,480
 Let's go.

570
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,680
Don't stink up the upholstery.

571
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,880
 They aren't guilty till a
jury says they are, partner.

572
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,280
[murmuring]

573
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,240
 Hello, Officer Smith.

574
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,880
I'm Janet Burroughs from
"The San Antonio Star."

575
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,240
 Pleased to meet
you, Ms. Burroughs.

576
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
 Oh, my.

577
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,080
Will Ms. ever catch on in Texas?

578
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,120
 I surely hope not, ma'am.

579
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,080
 What's up?

580
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,440
 That officer up
there is my partner.

581
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,920
He nailed that gentleman sitting
over there with his lawyer

582
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,080
after he beat an old man
half to death for 6 bucks.

583
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,960
 And?

584
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,480
 Well, we're all hoping
there's justice in this world.

585
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,280
Aren't we, Ms. Burroughs?

586
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,880
 Your Honor, the
People respectfully

587
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,160
request a 30-day continuance.

588
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,560
 Objection, Your Honor.

589
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,920
We're ready to proceed.

590
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,480
 What is the People's problem?

591
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,800
You've had two
continuances already.

592
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,560
 Well, Judge, our
victim is a 74-year-old

593
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,200
man who's afraid of reprisals.

594
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,800
Now, we haven't been able
to find him and think

595
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,200
he may have fled the state.

596
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,880
 Well, can you
proceed without him?

597
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,720
 No, we need his testimony.

598
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,840
I think the old guy's just
running scared, Your Honor.

599
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,480
 Well, I'm sorry, but if
you can't find your witness

600
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,400
I have no choice.

601
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,800
Case dismissed.

602
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,680
[murmuring]

603
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,520
 You are free.

604
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,400
 You're brilliant, man.

605
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,440
You're brilliant.

606
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,600
Don't threaten me, pig.

607
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,080
I got witnesses.

608
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,960
Well, go on, while
my lawyer's here.

609
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,560
Go ahead and say something.

610
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,920
 We'll be seeing you
again real soon, sonny.

611
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,040
BAILIFF: Next case.

612
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,480
Docket number 4859,
T. R. Brunell.

613
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,360
 Draw.

614
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,120
[gunshots]

615
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,680
 You're getting
better, Farrell.

616
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,760
 Well, beating you is
what keeps me going.

617
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,040
 That's a cute puppy.

618
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,960
Stephen told us
you loved animals.

619
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,840
 Yeah, you bet.

620
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,920
Ever heard of a man
giving his fiancee a puppy

621
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,520
for an engagement present?

622
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,040
Isn't that the cutest
thing you've ever heard of?

623
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,040
 My, you have brought out a
whole new side of that man.

624
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,800
 Yeah.

625
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,960
Beth?
- Mm-hm?

626
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,480
 Honey, can I be
perfectly honest with you?

627
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,600
 Oh, you don't ask me that.

628
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,800
 Well, gotta confess as the
wedding gets a little closer.

629
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,160
I'm a little nervous.

630
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,280
I mean, you know,
I ain't marrying

631
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,720
a schoolteacher or nothing.

632
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,080
 That's for damn sure.

633
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,000
 Yeah.

634
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,920
So?

635
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,160
I mean, what's it like?

636
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,520
 Oh, well.

637
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,640
Uh-- it's not the same
as it was for my mama.

638
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,480
Ferrell has to deal with
a whole different world

639
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,000
that my daddy did.

640
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,880
The violence has gotten worse.

641
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,000
And it used to be a
cop was respected.

642
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,520
Now he's killed.

643
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,600
It's harder.

644
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,360
Now it takes its toll.

645
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,800
Sometimes Stephen will
come home with that,

646
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,480
but I know you can handle it.

647
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
 I hope so.

648
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,720
 You fell in love with a man
who wants to make a difference.

649
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,400
And there'll be
times when you'll

650
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,760
be lying in bed wondering what
he's doing, thinking the worst.

651
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,560
But you just gotta replace those
thoughts with pleasanter ones.

652
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,360
Know what my mama told me?

653
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,640
To try to think of movies
with happy endings.

654
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,560
[suspenseful music]

655
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,880
[gunshots]

656
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
 Oh, god!

657
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,120
Please, please don't kill me!

658
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,120
Please, please, don't kill me!

659
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,120
Please don't kill me!

660
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,600
I'm gonna die!

661
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,680
 Another one of our, uh,
upstanding citizens, a B

662
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,000
and E repeater by the name
of, uh, Bobby Lee Duke

663
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,760
got his house shot
up last night.

664
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,760
 I understand Bobby Lee
suffered some property damage.

665
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,560
 He buy the ranch?

666
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,600
 Nope, but he sure was in
need of some clean underwear.

667
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,200
[laughter]

668
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,520
That's a third vigilante style
shooting this last month.

669
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,960
It doesn't make
us look too good.

670
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,400
 Well, you're right.

671
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,720
Whoever it was should've
wasted the little weasel.

672
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,680
 One last thing, compadres.

673
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,840
Chief's on the warpath
about unauthorized weapons.

674
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,000
You get caught holding,
you're off the street,

675
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,880
you're behind a desk.

676
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,160
Is that clear?

677
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,200
 Sergeant Guerrero,
do you mean to tell

678
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,400
us that officers of the
law are in possession

679
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,640
of illegal weapons?

680
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,840
[laughter]

681
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,880
 That'll be all.

682
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,240
Watch your butts out there.

683
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,120
 Do they make that
wig for men, Guerrero?

684
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,360
[laughter]

685
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,600
 Man, this town's
getting crazier.

686
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,000
 Old Bobby Lee's house got
hit with automatic weapon fire.

687
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,320
You mean even the geeks
got primo weapons?

688
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,680
 Them Dowads always
going to be knocking

689
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,000
each other off out there.

690
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,440
What do I care what
kind of guns they use?

691
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,240
 Well, I care what kind
of guns they use, Farrell.

692
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,720
There's a war
going on out there.

693
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,280
I want to know how
they're packing.

694
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,840
 Man, if they want to
take each other out,

695
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,520
why should we lose
sleep over it?

696
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,520
Works for me.
- Works for me.

697
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,840
[upbeat music and chatter]

698
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,960
 Oh, honey.

699
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,360
When you get your vacation,
we can take our honeymoon!

700
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,880
Can we go to New Orleans?

701
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,800
 OK.

702
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,240
 Oh, baby, yeah!

703
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,280
I've never been there before.
- My god, Farrell.

704
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,440
You'd think at least
his folks would

705
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,080
come to their son's wedding.

706
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,600
 Oh, well, he doesn't
talk about it that much.

707
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,480
I mean, you know, it's bad
enough he became a cop.

708
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,360
Worse that he works
on the South Side.

709
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,840
And now he's gone
and married into it.

710
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,160
 Oh, baby, it's
gonna be so great.

711
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,880
Shoot, I never been
out of Marin County!

712
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,680
[laughing]

713
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,200
 OK, Maggie.

714
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,640
Come on, now.

715
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,160
How many daughters you
got getting married today?

716
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,040
I think you owe us one.

717
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,000
 We near a speech.

718
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,120
Come on.

719
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,160
- Oh, no, shoot.
- Come on, Maggie,

720
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,400
 Come on, Mama.

721
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,840
 Don't be shy.

722
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,280
[laughter]

723
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,720
 I don't have any words.

724
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,640
 Well, that's a first, Mama.

725
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,560
 All right, hush your mouth.

726
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,800
[laughter]

727
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,920
Well, I'm sure I just
feel like every momma does

728
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,240
at a time like this, you know.

729
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,680
I'm just happy and I'm sand.

730
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,560
I'm sad because my
baby's going away.

731
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,960
Oh, god.

732
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,040
 Mama, don't make a scene.

733
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,680
 Well, I'm happy too.

734
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,320
Because she's gone
and found herself

735
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:09,600
someone who's responsible and
strong and with great buns.

736
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,640
[laughter]

737
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,400
 Shoot.

738
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,640
 I'll drink to that.

739
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,240
 Oh, no you wont.

740
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,280
[chatter]

741
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,640
 Mama, wake up.

742
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,120
 Aw, honey.

743
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,120
 My wife works at City
Hall and the word is that

744
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,520
the chief is
starting to take heat

745
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,720
over all them shoot 'em ups.

746
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,000
 You gotta admit,
it's pretty wild.

747
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,600
One sleazebag called in
to report a car bomb.

748
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,200
Of course he forgot
he stole the car.

749
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,640
[laughter]

750
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,720
Got his self arrested.

751
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,840
 Bad guys blast each other
away, the courts get clearer,

752
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,920
the taxpayers save a buck.
Self-containment.

753
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,000
I say let's have more of it.

754
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,280
 Some people just abdicate
their right to suck air.

755
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,160
[laughter]

756
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,160
 There you go.

757
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,400
Welcome to the cop club, boys.

758
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,440
And congratulations.
FARRELL: For what?

759
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,840
 Well it only took
you three years

760
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,960
to get the right attitude.

761
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,400
[laughter]

762
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,880
 Well, hey, we've all been
through a lot of changes

763
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,080
since we first
put on this badge.

764
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,520
And guess what?

765
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,920
There's gonna be a lot
more before we retire.

766
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,200
Um.

767
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:25,920
Here's to my partner and
to the brother I never had.

768
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,720
I want you to have a long
life and a happy marriage.

769
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,640
There you go.

770
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,160
 There you go, Smitty.

771
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,040
 Yeah.

772
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,400
[laughter]

773
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,040
 Ooh!

774
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,640
Honest to goodness,
you don't realize

775
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,960
how much junk you've got until
you've gotta move it all.

776
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,720
Ain't that the truth?

777
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,760
 That's never been
one of my problems.

778
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,360
 Well, I'm gonna give half this
stuff away, no doubt about it.

779
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,040
Maybe keep some of
it in Mama's garage.

780
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,000
Except for that green vase.

781
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,120
 There's no argument here.

782
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,040
[gunshots]

783
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,400
Just a little after 2100 hours.

784
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,560
We were packing things
in my wife's apartment

785
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,600
when I heard the
volley of shots.

786
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,280
I came down here to investigate,
and I found the victim already

787
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,560
laying dead in the parking lot.

788
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,440
 Thanks, Stephen.

789
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,840
 Officer Smith.

790
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,160
Ray Nicholas.

791
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,400
 I remember.

792
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,800
 You were the first
one on the scene?

793
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,680
 That's right.

794
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,920
 Did you see anything?

795
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,560
 Just the alleged
victim already dead.

796
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,440
 Alleged victim?

797
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,240
 I can't get real
worked up over a dead car

798
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,040
thief, Sergeant.

799
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,240
 Look at that shot group.

800
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,240
 We found shell casings from
a .45 up on the bridge there.

801
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:00,320
That's 60 yards away
through a chain link fence.

802
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,280
 You could fit both
those shots in a 10 ring.

803
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,080
[siren blaring]

804
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,640
 Hmm.

805
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,600
Not much to go on.

806
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,880
 That's some shooting.

807
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,320
Officer Tucker?

808
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,400
 Yeah.

809
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,720
 I'm Detective
Sergeant Nicholas.

810
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,320
This is Detective
Sergeant Arquette.

811
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,200
 How you doing?
What's this all about?

812
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,120
You want to come inside?

813
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,560
 No, thanks.

814
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,560
Do you know anything about
the shooting tonight?

815
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,280
- Which one?
- Two-bit burglar.

816
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,840
Some kid stealing a car stereo.

817
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,440
 Your partner Smith
was right there.

818
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,320
 Oh, where was it at?

819
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,760
 19th and San Geronimo.

820
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,040
 Oh, that's his wife's place.

821
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,200
You know, he just got married.

822
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,200
What's the point?

823
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,200
 You and Smith do a
lot of target practice,

824
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,120
don't you, Tucker?

825
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,000
 Yeah.

826
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,680
Yeah, we shoot a little.

827
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,160
What about it?

828
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,320
NICHOLAS; How good
a shot is Smith?

829
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,920
 He's good.

830
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,440
So am I.

831
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,360
 Well, are you good enough
to crank off three rounds

832
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,520
from a distance of
60 yards at night

833
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,000
and hit a man three times
through a chain link fence?

834
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,520
 Yeah, sure, if you give
me a rifle and a scope.

835
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,680
 How about a pistol?

836
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,720
 This is ridiculous.

837
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,720
Stephen's off-duty when
a shooting goes down.

838
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,200
He calls it in,
stays on the scene.

839
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,080
He does what he's supposed
to do, am I right?

840
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,600
You want to know anything
else, you ask him yourself.

841
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,280
Now may I go in to
my family, Sergeants?

842
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,160
NICHOLAS: Yeah, Tucker.

843
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,960
Yeah, thanks.

844
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,800
 I sure rather would be
playing more than just a hunch.

845
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,560
 [sighs] Yeah, but
the question is, do you

846
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,480
want your hunch to be right?

847
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,360
 [clearing throat]

848
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,520
 Farrell, what
are you doing here?

849
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,000
Come over here, check this out.

850
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,080
 I need to talk to you.

851
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,040
 OK.

852
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,880
Thank you.

853
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,240
Is there a problem?

854
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,240
 You're a suspect in the
Terry Folsom shooting.

855
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,280
 Oh, come on.

856
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,760
That's crazy.

857
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,520
Whoever's saying that, I
can't believe that, Farrell.

858
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,280
 I think they're fishing.

859
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,120
I mean, if they had anything,
you know, they'd charge you.

860
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,440
Stephen, did you say anything
that might have set him off?

861
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,360
Anything--

862
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,240
 No.

863
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,800
No way.

864
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,840
No, I gave them the facts,
same as if it was my report.

865
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,800
This is just crazy, Farrell.

866
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,720
 I know.

867
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,880
It's all these shootings.

868
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,760
It's just got everybody going.

869
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,800
It's getting everybody.

870
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,920
 You know, I didn't
have to become a cop.

871
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,880
I chose this job.

872
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,320
My father wanted me to stay in
college and become a lawyer,

873
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,760
but I did not need some
half-baked legal system

874
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,520
to tell me what's
right and what's wrong.

875
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,040
They're messing with
the wrong guy, Farrell.

876
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,960
 Oh.

877
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,520
Come in, Tucker.

878
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,440
Have a seat.

879
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,040
 Chief, I want to
thank you for seeing me.

880
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,520
 Well, what's on your mind?

881
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,120
 Well, I'm sure I'm not telling
you anything that you don't

882
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,360
already know, but Stephen Smith
is a suspect in the shooting

883
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,880
of a burglary the other night.

884
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,120
 And you disagree.

885
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,840
 Yes, Chief, I surely do.

886
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,200
Now, anyone who
knows Stephen knows

887
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,960
that what these detectives
are suggesting is impossible.

888
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,880
HOGAN: Now look--

889
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,400
 No, sir.

890
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,360
Now, if what they told
me is all they've got,

891
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,560
then they are risking
a man's career

892
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,280
because they're under some
kind of political pressure.

893
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,400
 Officer, I hope
you're not suggesting

894
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,400
that this department is looking
for some sort of a scapegoat.

895
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,400
 Sir, all I am asking for
here is a little fairness.

896
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,720
Now, all they've got out
there right now are stories.

897
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,360
And there are stories
about every patrolman

898
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,760
in this department.

899
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,920
There are stories
about me, and I'm

900
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,000
sure there were
stories about you

901
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,120
when you were in uniform too.

902
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,160
 Now, you hold it right there.

903
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,640
That's enough.

904
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,960
I'll be the judge of whether
or not an investigation

905
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,680
is being conducted properly.

906
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,920
Is that clear?

907
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,400
Is that clear?

908
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,400
 Yes, sir.

909
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,400
 Then you're dismissed, Tucker.

910
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,920
 Hey, loose lips.

911
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,800
 You talking to me, Frank?

912
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,600
 Word is you went to the
chief for your buddy buddy.

913
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,600
Is that true?

914
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,440
 That's true enough, not that
it's any of your business.

915
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,840
 Nice move, Tucker.

916
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,280
Guess what list you
just went the top of?

917
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,320
 Listen, Frank, why don't
you get to the point, huh?

918
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,000
 Chances are Internal
Affairs will stay out

919
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,520
of this unless someone like you
is in there stirring things up.

920
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,880
Then we run the
risk of a rogue cop

921
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,520
being put on public display.

922
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,760
 A rogue cop?

923
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,160
How can you complain
about a rogue cop

924
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,840
in this department shift?

925
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,160
And when was the last time you
played by departmental rules,

926
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,720
huh?

927
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,520
You still got that little
tape recorder with you, huh?

928
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,680
 Come on, Farrell.

929
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,560
Nobody thinks Smith
is guilty, OK?

930
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,360
It's a bum rap.

931
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,800
 Well, is that
right or isn't it?

932
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,800
Just say it.

933
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,160
All right then.

934
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,720
You keep your mouth shut
or I'll shut it for you.

935
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,440
 Any heat your sweetheart
takes better not

936
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,160
burn anybody else, bubba.

937
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,120
[glass shattering]

938
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,600
[grunting]

939
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,960
 Come on, guys, break up!

940
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,760
 Grab him!

941
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,760
Grab him!

942
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,240
Come on!

943
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,640
 Why are these guys so jumpy?

944
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,040
 Tucker broke the code
when he came to you.

945
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,560
 Hmm.

946
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,640
What do we got here?

947
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,360
 A trigger-happy cop.

948
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,920
Maybe two.

949
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,320
[shouting]

950
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,240
 Aw, check it out.

951
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,080
Be cool.

952
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:46,000
 Must be lunchtime, otherwise
you'd all be hard at work.

953
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,640
Oh, but you are
working, aren't you?

954
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,840
All right, everybody,
let's come up with some ID.

955
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,840
 Oh man.

956
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,040
 Man, we're just kicking back.

957
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,120
We ain't doing
nothing wrong at all.

958
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,120
 These ladies are
so attractive, I'm

959
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,280
gonna give them a screen test.

960
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,000
 Hey, man, what's
this all about?

961
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,880
 Damn, man.

962
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,960
Are you crazy?

963
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,720
 Say cheese.

964
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,280
 OK, you've got yourself three.

965
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,560
That's it for you, man.

966
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,760
 This is no time to be shy.

967
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,720
 Wait, no!

968
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,000
Look, just no picture.

969
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,520
It ain't right.

970
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,720
 Since when does a punk
like you decide what's right?

971
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,400
Clinton Corey.

972
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,320
 Look, man, if I
ain't under arrest,

973
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,720
you can't take my picture.

974
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,480
No!

975
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,120
 Maybe you got more to hide
than just your face, Clinton.

976
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,600
 Look, man, you got family?

977
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,960
You got kids?

978
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,840
You take my picture, and
maybe someday you won't.

979
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,160
 You just threatened an
officer of the law, Clinton.

980
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,880
 No, man, I didn't
say anything at all.

981
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,080
Did y'all hear me say anything?

982
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,840
WOMEN: Mm-mm.

983
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,040
 I didn't.

984
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,520
 OK, no screen test for you.

985
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,400
But you're never going
to get to be a star

986
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,480
with that attitude, Clinton.

987
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,120
Easy, partner.

988
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,160
It's just me, class of '79.

989
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,440
 Hey.

990
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,480
What are you doing
sneaking around here?

991
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,720
 I want to talk to you.

992
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,040
 All right.

993
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,320
 I know what you've been doing.

994
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,640
Going to the chief.

995
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,240
Laying into Frank Shifton.

996
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,720
But your my best
buddy, and I don't

997
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,280
want you getting fired over me.
- Come on, Stephen.

998
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,440
This is a bunch of bull.

999
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,600
I can't just stand aside.

1000
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,160
 No, that's what
I want you to do.

1001
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,440
That's exactly what
you have to do.

1002
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,600
I'm innocent.

1003
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,800
You're standing
by the right guy.

1004
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,520
But let me ride it out, OK?

1005
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,680
I can handle it.

1006
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,680
It's my beef.

1007
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,920
And I can take care of myself.

1008
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,680
All right?

1009
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,480
All right?

1010
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,560
Farrell, don't make it
harder on me, all right?

1011
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,480
 All right.

1012
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,600
 Come on, I'll buy
you a cup of coffee.

1013
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,440
[suspenseful music]

1014
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,320
[explosions]

1015
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,640
[dogs barking]

1016
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,640
 Oh!

1017
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,920
 You go over to the
Johnsons and call 911.

1018
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,360
Hurry, 911!
Hurry, hurry!

1019
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,560
 How you feel this
morning, honey?

1020
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,480
Couldn't sleep again last night?

1021
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,680
 Hi, sweetie.

1022
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,680
 Hey.

1023
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,080
 Hey, Marjorie, come on, honey.

1024
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,440
[doorbell ringing]

1025
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,120
Come on, Marjorie.

1026
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:35,920
Jimmy.

1027
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,080
 Hey, Lea.
Everything OK?

1028
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,400
What's the matter?

1029
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,880
 Can I come in and talk
to you for a minute?

1030
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,560
 Well, sure, you bet.
Come on in.

1031
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,840
BETH: Come on, kids.

1032
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,160
CHILDREN: Hi, Mrs. Smith.

1033
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,400
- Say bye, Mrs. Smith.
- Bye!

1034
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,680
Bye, Ms. Smith.
- Jimmy Dean.

1035
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,600
I love you.
OK.

1036
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,600
Hurry up.

1037
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,200
You button up your jacket there.

1038
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,360
Hey, you want some coffee?

1039
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,840
 No, thank you, Beth.

1040
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,600
FARRELL: Well,
what's the matter?

1041
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,400
 It's Stephen.

1042
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,040
He don't sleep much, Farrell.

1043
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,280
And sometimes a whole day goes
by and he don't eat nothing.

1044
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,120
 Well, he's under
a lot of stress,

1045
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,840
and that can kill the appetite.

1046
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,960
 It's-- it's like a whole
wall goes up around him.

1047
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,760
He don't even know
that I'm there.

1048
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,080
 This investigation
will be over soon.

1049
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,200
OK?

1050
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,120
He'll be cleared
of all suspicion,

1051
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,160
and it'll just go away.

1052
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,280
 What investigation?

1053
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,080
What are you talking
about, Farrell?

1054
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,960
 Well, he didn't tell you?

1055
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,080
 The shooting in back
of your apartment.

1056
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,800
You don't know
anything about this?

1057
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,120
 You're starting to
scare me, Farrell.

1058
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,400
What are you talking about?

1059
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,760
 Oh, sweetie.

1060
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,040
Sweetie.

1061
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,880
FARRELL: There is
nothing to it, OK?

1062
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,560
Stephen is a suspect
in a shooting.

1063
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,040
It's all political, Lea.
- What?

1064
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,040
FARRELL: He didn't do a thing.

1065
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:00,840
He is innocent.

1066
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,400
 Chief, can I get
some quotes from you

1067
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,880
on the bombing of your house?

1068
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,320
 Number on, no, you may not.

1069
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,120
Number two, how'd
you get in here?

1070
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,800
 I charmed my way
past the duty officer.

1071
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,400
Now, why would anybody want
to firebomb your house, sir?

1072
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,040
 A police chief
has natural enemies.

1073
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,360
 Yes, but this
crosses the line.

1074
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,880
Can you see how this
looks to John Q. Texan?

1075
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,240
 No, little lady,
how did it look?

1076
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,560
 Like the bad guys are winning.

1077
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,720
 Gentlemen, we have
ourselves an image problem.

1078
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,600
But it's one there's not
going to be with us very long.

1079
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,640
This, uh, lady
reporter says that she

1080
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,480
has taking the pulse
of our community

1081
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,440
and that there is
a growing tendency

1082
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:55,120
to view this department
as a bunch of pistoleros.

1083
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:59,120
She further notes that
the Chamber of Commerce

1084
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:02,040
wishes to stress
that San Antonio

1085
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,240
is America's
fastest growing city

1086
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,920
and not part of the Wild West.

1087
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,200
Now, gentlemen, we
are going to pay

1088
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,040
heed to what's being said here.

1089
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:19,000
From now on, we play it
strictly by the book.

1090
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,680
Then our problem is
going to go away.

1091
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,160
I do hope that's clear.

1092
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,800
One more thing.

1093
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,320
As everybody here is aware,
my home recently suffered

1094
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:36,040
an attack by persons unknown.

1095
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,800
I want you to know
that my wife is fine.

1096
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,040
She's mad as hell,
but she's fine.

1097
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,280
I'm here to ask each one of you
to work extra hard and find out

1098
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,120
who did this to me.

1099
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,480
Thank you.

1100
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,600
 All right.

1101
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,640
Any questions?

1102
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,200
 Hey, Sarge.

1103
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,000
What's a pistolero?

1104
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,760
[laughter]

1105
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,040
GUERRERO: Let's hit the streets.

1106
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,240
DISPATCH (ON RADIO): We have
a domestic complaint at 1 2

1107
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,480
1 4 9 Grant, 2 6.

1108
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,680
Sounds like some guy's
wailing on his old lady.

1109
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,440
 2 6, 10-4.

1110
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:38,920
Might need backup.

1111
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,000
 What's the problem?

1112
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,240
 I want that good for
nothing out of the house!

1113
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,360
You get him out!

1114
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,320
 All right, ma'am,
just calm down.

1115
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,600
You tell us your name.

1116
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,120
 Lucy Gorgon.

1117
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:16,520
And that-- that animal in
there is Harold Sanders.

1118
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,800
I'll tell you what he did.

1119
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,880
He rammed his car into mine.

1120
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,680
He beat me up, he threw me
out, and he locked the door!

1121
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,360
Hell, I pay half the rent here.

1122
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,920
 Willing to press
charges, Lucy?

1123
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,240
 I ain't willing
to press nothing.

1124
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,720
You just get him
out of the house!

1125
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,880
 All right, wait here.

1126
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,520
Listen, let's just talk to him.

1127
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,040
I don't think you should rip
your new uniform if she ain't

1128
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,160
gonna follow through in court.

1129
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,000
[banging]

1130
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,280
 You in there, Mr. Sanders?

1131
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,720
MR. SANDERS: You
cops get out of here.

1132
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,400
This ain't none
of your business!

1133
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,280
 Yeah, just open up, sir.

1134
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,920
All we want to do is talk.

1135
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,680
MR. SANDERS: You want to side
with that ho, you go ahead.

1136
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,000
She found out what a
man can do, and so will

1137
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,920
anyone else who tries to get
in, and that means you too!

1138
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,320
 Stephen.

1139
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,080
Stephen.

1140
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,680
Look, he hit a car and took off.

1141
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,000
That's just hit and run.

1142
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,240
We call a tow truck,
we'll impound his car.

1143
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,160
It'd cool his heels for a while.

1144
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:11,920
 All right.

1145
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,040
 Can you hear me?

1146
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,960
 I can hear you.

1147
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,200
Big man when you got
another guy backing you up.

1148
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,320
You get the hell off my
property before I come

1149
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,240
out there and make you leave!

1150
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,400
 Why don't you come out
here, you gutless slug?

1151
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,280
 What you say to me?

1152
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,200
What you say to me?

1153
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,360
You can't say that to me!

1154
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,280
Go on!

1155
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,640
You just keep walking out!

1156
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,800
And you, you get your
ass down the road now!

1157
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,680
Go on!

1158
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,600
Move on!

1159
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,560
Go on, keep walking now!

1160
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,840
I'm tired of looking at you!

1161
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,360
I need help.

1162
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,280
My car's getting ripped up.

1163
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,400
No, don't send a cop!

1164
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,400
It's a cop that's doing it!

1165
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,920
 Stephen.

1166
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,920
Hey, man.

1167
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,880
Hey!

1168
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,920
What the hell are you doing?

1169
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,920
I can't believe you!

1170
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,000
I can't believe you did this!

1171
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:13,920
 Why not, Farrell?

1172
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,200
You heard him.

1173
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,840
Mr. Sanderson there
is a man among men.

1174
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,200
A man of his caliber
is going to have

1175
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,360
this all fixed up in no time.

1176
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,440
You should back off.

1177
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,040
I can handle it, all right?

1178
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,560
 Look, is this
how you handle it?

1179
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,040
 Don't get bent, man.

1180
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,360
 I thought you had more to you.

1181
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,040
 Shut up, Farrell.

1182
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,840
 Oh, you're just going to let
him beat you down, aren't you?

1183
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,040
Until you're as bad as they are.

1184
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,520
This is your car, all right?

1185
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,880
You go ahead and take it.

1186
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,360
It's all yours.

1187
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,680
[tense music]

1188
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,280
[alarm clock buzzing]

1189
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,160
 Farrell?

1190
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,200
 Yeah?

1191
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,840
 Can you listen to this?

1192
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,640
 What?

1193
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,600
Listen to this.

1194
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,560
"San Antonio police officer
was suspended yesterday

1195
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,280
after vandalizing the
automobile of a suspect

1196
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,720
in a routine domestic dispute.

1197
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,480
Police Chief Hogan claiming
that the officer, Stephen Smith,

1198
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,880
lost his cool."

1199
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,520
It says he took strong
action as quote,

1200
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,840
"a demonstration of my intent
as chief of this department

1201
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,560
to see to it that each and
every officer of my force

1202
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,280
performs his duties strictly
according to the book."

1203
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,640
End quote.

1204
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,640
Did you know about this?

1205
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,560
 Yeah.

1206
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,840
Yeah, he blew it.

1207
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,800
I was there.

1208
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,080
I'd better go find him now.

1209
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,840
[chatter]

1210
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,200
Have you seen Stephen around?

1211
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,280
 I don't know where
he is, Farrell.

1212
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,560
I don't know what he
does with his time.

1213
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:39,120
He's lost without his badge.

1214
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,800
[suspenseful music]

1215
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,160
[chatter]

1216
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,720
 Who is it?

1217
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,480
What you want?

1218
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,200
Oh.

1219
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,520
Got your camera, cracker?

1220
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,160
 Not quite.

1221
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,520
Not this time.

1222
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,880
[gunshot]

1223
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,400
 Clinton Corey was a pimp who
dabbled in running numbers.

1224
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,080
He could've had a
million enemies.

1225
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,800
 Is there a possible connection
between the Corey shooting and

1226
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,360
any other vigilante shootings?

1227
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,360
 That'd be a good story, but
no hard evidence to support it.

1228
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,480
Clinton Corey was shot
point blank by someone

1229
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,160
he probably did business with.

1230
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,680
 Sergeant, can I talk to you?

1231
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,240
 Janet, will you
excuse us for a minute?

1232
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,000
 Sure.

1233
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,960
 I believe Smith's suspension
is connected to that shooting

1234
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,440
outside his wife's apartment.

1235
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,120
And you guys are still after
him on that, aren't you?

1236
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,200
 You offering evidence, Tucker?

1237
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,320
 That was a long time ago.

1238
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,840
If you guys had anything,
you'd have charged him by now.

1239
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,600
It's tearing him to
pieces, Sergeant.

1240
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,480
 I'm doing my job, Tucker.

1241
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,360
If it'll make you
feel any better,

1242
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,240
you're no longer a suspect.

1243
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,120
 You guys are
unbelievable, you know that?

1244
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,600
Let me tell you something.

1245
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,120
If you push Stephen
Smith over the edge

1246
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,360
and come to find out
that you're wrong,

1247
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,080
well then you're gonna
have to come deal with me.

1248
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:05,880
All right, Nicholas?

1249
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,120
[country music]

1250
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,360
 9-inch barrel.

1251
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:23,240
Of course it's gonna be more
accurate than a smaller barrel.

1252
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,920
 The thing is, you got this
here, and pointing it down--

1253
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,040
 Oh, right.

1254
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,640
 Give me a double
bourbon, Hank.

1255
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,840
 Oh, Farrell!

1256
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,600
It's not even happy hour yet.

1257
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,200
 Has anybody seen
Stephen around?

1258
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,560
 Uh, he wouldn't come in here.

1259
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,280
He's not exactly this
month's cop centerfold.

1260
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,840
 Hey!

1261
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,800
Now, Stephen is twice the
cop any of us will ever be,

1262
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:42,760
and you know it.

1263
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,200
 Maybe he is, OK.

1264
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,640
But if you care about
your future on this force,

1265
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,120
you might just want to
keep your nose out of it.

1266
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,960
 Is that what you
think too, Castro?

1267
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,120
 Kevin's got a point, Farrell.

1268
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,680
You know, I got a
pension to think about.

1269
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,800
 It's so dangerous
now, they've got

1270
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,640
the attendant in this
bulletproof glass booth

1271
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,000
with no door.

1272
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,400
You've seen these in the
self-service station,

1273
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,920
haven't you?
Yeah?

1274
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,920
There's just a little hole
to stick the money through.

1275
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,600
How does this guy
get into this booth?

1276
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,360
[laughter]

1277
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,160
 Daddy?

1278
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,960
Wanna have a fast wheels race?

1279
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:27,640
 Uh-- uh, no, not
tonight, pal, all right?

1280
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,000
 When?

1281
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,760
 Well, how about
tomorrow night, OK?

1282
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,960
We'll play with
it tomorrow night.

1283
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,480
- OK.
- OK.

1284
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,080
 Well, I'll just go set up
the track anyway, in case

1285
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,520
you change your mind.

1286
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,440
 All right, you go
ahead and do that then.

1287
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,840
 Plus, you might
change your mind.

1288
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,040
 Yeah, I-- I might.

1289
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,200
[phone ringing]

1290
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,280
Hello.

1291
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,400
Yeah.

1292
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,320
Hi, Lea.

1293
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,760
Yeah, wh-- OK, good.

1294
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,080
That's good.

1295
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,520
All right, let me--
let me talk to him, OK?

1296
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,400
Oh.

1297
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,480
Uh-- yeah, well, um--

1298
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,760
well, at least he's home.

1299
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,760
OK.

1300
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,080
I'll see you later, then.

1301
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:07,880
Bye.

1302
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,640
Stephen got home.

1303
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,520
 Oh.

1304
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,040
It's about time.

1305
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,400
 And went straight
to bed, Lea said.

1306
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,760
 Well, maybe you
should too, honey.

1307
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,800
You haven't been
sleeping too well lately.

1308
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:29,040
 You know, they're gonna
hang Stephen out to dry.

1309
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,120
Just to show how hard
they've been working

1310
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,840
to keep this town straight.

1311
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,960
He was in the wrong
place at the wrong time,

1312
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,760
and now he's gotta
take the heat.

1313
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,480
Politics isn't who gets elected.

1314
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,280
Politics also says
who gets eliminated.

1315
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,000
 Politics are also
temporary, Farrell.

1316
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,720
Nobody is on the top or
on the bottom forever.

1317
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,560
 Not if you're a cop
that's going to jail.

1318
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,280
They want him for murder.

1319
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:08,120
And Stephen said he would
rather die than go to jail.

1320
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,440
 Officer Smith, you have been
suspended not for defending

1321
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,440
yourself in any improper way
but because you willfully

1322
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,680
destroyed private property.

1323
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,040
 I'm fully aware that, sir.

1324
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:26,480
What I hope to do is look
hard at the word willfully.

1325
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,440
The reason that I'm
appealing the suspension

1326
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:34,520
is because I feel like I wasn't
reacting to the situation that

1327
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,320
was occurring, but
rather to the one

1328
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,680
that had happened before, the
one that I was almost killed.

1329
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,160
I got it reversed, Farrell.

1330
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,120
 All right.

1331
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,280
OK.

1332
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,840
 And aren't you
ashamed of yourself?

1333
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,960
 Look, I didn't mean to--

1334
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,960
 Punching out your best buddy.

1335
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,720
 All right, I shouldn't have.

1336
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,160
I shouldn't have.

1337
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,040
 You see?

1338
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,960
You lost faith in me.

1339
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,920
I told you I'd handle it.

1340
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,640
I got half a chance when
I'm not dealing with all

1341
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,520
that political garbage.

1342
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,400
 Here's to the Civil
Service Commission, who knows

1343
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,960
a great cop when they see one.

1344
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:22,840
 Cheers.

1345
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,400
 I second that.

1346
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,920
 When y'all going
back to work, Stephen?

1347
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,200
 Tomorrow.

1348
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,920
 And we are gonna
stomp somebody, partner.

1349
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,480
The criminal elements
in San Antonio

1350
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,080
will not sleep well tonight.

1351
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,880
 Bet you're gonna be happy
when he gets out of the house.

1352
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,040
 Whatever makes you say that?

1353
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,080
 You don't have
to worry about Lea.

1354
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,080
She's a good old girl.

1355
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,400
She can take care of herself.

1356
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,000
 Well, here's to
getting back to normal.

1357
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,880
 Hey, hey.

1358
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,720
[chatter]

1359
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,680
 Michael Sturtevant.

1360
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,400
We meet again.

1361
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,120
 They cut me loose, man.

1362
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,120
What do you want?

1363
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,040
 Nothing.

1364
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,840
Just memories.

1365
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,640
 Well, I don't even
know who you are.

1366
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,360
 Michael Sturtevant.

1367
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,760
Your specialty: assault
on defenseless old men.

1368
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,560
MO: nighttime on foot.

1369
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,320
Home address: 13--

1370
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,280
13 something Vista Place.

1371
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,040
 That is a soaring
intellect you got.

1372
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,040
 I'm a poet now.

1373
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:36,800
Did you know that?

1374
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,280
When life has been
lived too long

1375
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,000
and the sun is
low on the sky, we

1376
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,240
must take our
place in the ground

1377
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,640
and cover the grave
with flowers of evil.

1378
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,200
What you think?

1379
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,200
Got a shot at the Pulitzer?

1380
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:01,160
[suspenseful music]

1381
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,800
 Michael Sturtevant.

1382
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,480
Professional punk
and two-time loser.

1383
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,240
 Third time's a charm.

1384
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,440
Judging from the trajectory, I'd
say he was shot from the roof

1385
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,680
of that building over there.

1386
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,880
 Whoever it is, he
likes a challenge.

1387
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,760
- Farrell.
- What?

1388
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,160
 Going shooting out
at the Grove tomorrow.

1389
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,960
You want to come along?

1390
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,880
 Well, I've got a choice.

1391
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:25,160
I can keep buying ammunition,
or I can make my house payments.

1392
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,400
Got a quarter?

1393
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,520
 No.

1394
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,960
Did you hear another one
went down last night?

1395
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,440
 No, what?

1396
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,680
 Remember that punk
that wore the earring

1397
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:38,040
and liked to beat up on old men?

1398
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,240
Someone rid society of
Michael Sturtevant last night.

1399
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,320
 Hi, Janet.
Thanks for coming.

1400
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,280
 Hi.

1401
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:57,080
My curiosity is overwhelmed.

1402
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:05,320
 Janet, what if I were to
tell you that I think there's

1403
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,840
a connection between the
sniper shootings of Terry

1404
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,720
Folsom and Michael Sturtevant
and the point blank shooting

1405
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,520
of Clinton Corey?

1406
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,440
 This is on the record?

1407
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,280
 No.

1408
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,120
I believe strongly that
the person who's committing

1409
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,720
these murders is carefully
selecting his victims

1410
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,000
based on their criminal record.

1411
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,200
Now, if you're writing
an article about this,

1412
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,720
I would also mention what
a good shot this person is.

1413
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,920
How he can spray a house
with automatic weapon fire

1414
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,280
and not hurt anybody.

1415
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,760
But when he wants
to put someone down,

1416
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,440
he can do it from 60
yards with a pistol.

1417
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,680
 Raymond.

1418
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:42,000
We're talking about someone who
has access to criminal records

1419
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,800
and is a sharpshooter.

1420
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:47,440
Ray, are you telling me
this person is a cop?

1421
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,920
 I wouldn't tell you to
walk away from that theory.

1422
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,600
 Forgive my cynicism, but
am I being set up here?

1423
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,880
 Janet, Chief
Hogan has asked me

1424
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,880
to use every means to
apprehend this shooter,

1425
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,280
who is also most
likely the man who

1426
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,760
firebombed the chief's house.

1427
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,040
And I am using every means,
and you are one of them.

1428
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,880
[suspenseful music]

1429
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,600
[dog whimpering]

1430
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,360
 Go on, get.

1431
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,240
Get!

1432
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,600
[dog barking]

1433
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,240
 What did you do
to her, you bastard?

1434
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,440
STEPHEN: I didn't do anything.

1435
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,760
 Would you listen to her!

1436
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,760
 The stupid dog was
sniffing around my guns.

1437
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,240
I didn't want it to get hurt.

1438
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,560
 You are such a liar!

1439
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,280
 Don't you call me a liar!

1440
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,600
 Oh, you're not a liar?

1441
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,960
Did you ever tell me
about all the trouble

1442
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,160
you were in about what
was happening to you?

1443
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,080
No.

1444
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,120
Farrell had to tell me.

1445
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,000
 For one thing, it's none
of your damn business.

1446
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,080
And for another thing, Farrell
should keep his big mouth shut!

1447
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,800
 Would you just listen
to yourself, Stephen?

1448
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,840
Farrell is the only
real friend you've got.

1449
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,960
I don't even know you anymore.

1450
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,640
I can't live like this.

1451
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,080
I cannot live like this!

1452
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,920
I can't take this
anymore, Stephen!

1453
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,640
I'm leaving!

1454
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:16,720
 No.

1455
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,640
No, you're not.

1456
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,080
You are not leaving me, Lea!

1457
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,680
I am not going to be
attacked by everyone!

1458
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,240
You are staying right here!

1459
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,200
You listen up, girl.

1460
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,360
You listen up, girl!

1461
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,520
I am not gonna have
you joining forces

1462
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,600
with everyone against me!

1463
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,120
 What are you talking about?

1464
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,600
I don't know and I don't care!

1465
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,880
You're crazy, Stephen!

1466
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,160
 Do you wanna know
what I'm talking about?

1467
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,520
You wanna know what
I'm talking about?

1468
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,600
I'll tell you what
I'm talking about.

1469
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,080
I'm gonna tell you a
secret now, baby, that's

1470
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,840
gonna join us at the hip.

1471
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:45,640
 Ah!

1472
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,680
What?

1473
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,680
Stephen, stop it!

1474
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,680
Stop!

1475
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,560
No!

1476
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,680
Stephen!

1477
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,760
No!

1478
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:00,520
No!

1479
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,480
[crying]

1480
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,640
 I swear I was
gonna pay for it!

1481
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:14,960
They didn't give me a chance.

1482
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,320
 Next time you'll
be more careful.

1483
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,200
[glass shattering]

1484
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,400
Dammit!

1485
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,360
Stop!

1486
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,240
 Hey, man!

1487
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:42,720
 Hey!

1488
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,680
 Hey!

1489
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:45,520
 Watch it!

1490
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,000
 Oh!

1491
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,320
 Put your hands
behind your back!

1492
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,120
 Ah!

1493
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,920
Ah, it's hurting, man!

1494
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,240
 You all right?

1495
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,880
PERP: You're hurting me!

1496
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,880
 Get up!

1497
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,000
 I was about to pay, I swear!

1498
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,920
 Oh, what, you're
gonna cry for me?

1499
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:09,560
You're gonna cry for
me, a big man like you?

1500
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,200
Break my heart,
you gutless punk.

1501
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,640
 I didn't do anything, I swear!

1502
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,080
- Shut up!
- I didn't do anything!

1503
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,440
- Shut up!
- I didn't!

1504
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,600
Ah!

1505
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,720
 You want something
to cry about?

1506
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,280
- I didn't do nothing!
- Shut up!

1507
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,080
Take that!
Take that!

1508
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:22,320
Take that, take that!
Here!

1509
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,240
Take that!

1510
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,040
Take it like a man, huh!

1511
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,280
 What's the matter, Officer?

1512
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,320
Have you forgotten
how to take orders?

1513
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,200
The gun too.

1514
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,080
Sergeant, see to it
that Officer Smith is

1515
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,200
booked on assault and battery.

1516
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,280
 Man, I've never seen
anything like this.

1517
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,320
Little old lady's
complaint was you

1518
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,400
slapped around some
shoplifter, and you get this?

1519
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,720
It's like the chief's
gonna come down

1520
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,920
on you with both boots, man.

1521
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,960
 Hey, Sarge.

1522
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,160
Chief tells me you're
sending me a bad guy.

1523
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,080
Famous too.

1524
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,960
A real legend.

1525
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,320
 Just book him, Frank.

1526
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,680
Paperwork will be sent down.

1527
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,080
 Brutalizing the
citizenry, huh.

1528
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,160
My, my.

1529
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,640
I thought you'd learn more
than that at the academy.

1530
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,840
Indefinite suspension
same as being fired.

1531
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:59,320
You're out of here.

1532
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,440
 Drop dead, Shifton.

1533
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,440
 What goes down on the
street stays on the street.

1534
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,240
You forgot that rule.

1535
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,120
It's the only one you
should never forget.

1536
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,080
Your buddy never should've
gone to the chief.

1537
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,600
When you made Hogan
eat his suspension,

1538
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,680
he just figured he'd
wait for you to screw up.

1539
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,480
How didn't have to
wait too long, did he?

1540
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,040
Take this guy against the wall.

1541
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:29,800
You know the routine.

1542
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:34,520
Side.

1543
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,960
[door buzzing]

1544
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,880
 Farrell.
Thank god.

1545
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:52,720
I knew I could count on you.

1546
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,560
Not you too.

1547
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,680
 I don't know.

1548
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,480
I thought I was sure,
but I don't know anymore.

1549
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,200
You're too out of control.

1550
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,440
 No.

1551
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,840
That's where you're wrong.

1552
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,840
You gotta listen to me.

1553
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:12,200
They are doing everything
they can to break me because I

1554
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,320
am too much in control.

1555
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,480
It's all political.

1556
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,680
They need somebody
to take the fall.

1557
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,520
 You want me to
believe in you, then

1558
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,560
you answer me this question.

1559
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,600
 You ask me anything.

1560
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,520
I'm your friend.

1561
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,600
I won't lie to you.

1562
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,000
 Why didn't Lea leave you and
why won't she talk about it?

1563
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,360
Or is that political too?

1564
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,720
 No, of course it's not.

1565
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:51,240
She's a victim, just like I am.

1566
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:54,080
And the main reason I gotta get
out of here is to talk to her.

1567
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,600
 Stop dodging the question.

1568
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,520
Why'd she leave you?

1569
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,680
 You want to know
why she left me?

1570
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,120
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you why she left me.

1571
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,680
Because she's weak.

1572
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:05,040
She's a frail, gentle woman.

1573
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,360
That's why I didn't
tell her my troubles.

1574
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,720
Look what happened.

1575
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:12,160
As soon as I told her,
she panicked, she ran.

1576
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,520
The strong have to
protect the weak, Farrell.

1577
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,440
That's the truth.

1578
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,520
That's why I became a cop.

1579
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:37,880
All my life, everything I
worked for, it's all gone.

1580
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,360
She's all I got left.

1581
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:47,960
I gotta get out of here
so that I can talk to her.

1582
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,720
 I spoke to the prosecutor.

1583
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,560
He's going to recommend
that you be released

1584
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,000
on your own recognizance.

1585
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,440
[suspenseful music]

1586
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,360
[knocking]

1587
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,760
 Open the door, Maggie.

1588
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,800
 Stephen, don't you
make me call the cops.

1589
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,680
 I love her, Maggie.

1590
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,320
I'm not gonna hurt or.

1591
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,400
Now open the door.

1592
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,440
Come on.

1593
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:44,240
I won't say long.

1594
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,520
 You're not gonna hit me again?

1595
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,040
 No, I'm not gonna hit you.

1596
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:06,440
Lea.

1597
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,520
We're partners.

1598
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:17,200
And from now on, I'm gonna
let you in on everything I do.

1599
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,640
 You already told me too much.

1600
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,400
 If Stephen takes advantage of
his suspension to get therapy,

1601
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,880
well that's gotta
work in his favor.

1602
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,080
 Stephen would never
go to a therapist.

1603
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,320
He's already whistled
through several

1604
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,800
psychological evaluations.

1605
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,120
Honey, you should have
seen the way he looked

1606
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,960
at me when he was in jail.

1607
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,160
I don't know.

1608
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:52,480
You know, it made me wonder.

1609
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,440
I didn't know him anymore.

1610
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,280
[car approaching]

1611
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:24,400
Tell me what happened.

1612
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,440
 It don't matter what
he might do to me.

1613
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:30,960
I gotta make myself
right with God.

1614
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,960
 Tell me.

1615
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,120
 He did it.

1616
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:34,920
He's guilty.

1617
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:40,120
He killed them all.

1618
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,560
 How do you know?

1619
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,440
Where's the proof?

1620
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,560
 He hunts people like animals.

1621
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,080
He told me it's him who kills
what's wrong with the world.

1622
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,760
It's him, Farrell.

1623
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,200
The killer cop.

1624
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:00,240
 Where is he?

1625
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,800
Where is he right now?

1626
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,040
 I don't know.

1627
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:05,960
But you better find him.

1628
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,880
He's not through,
he's gonna kill again.

1629
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,720
Hogan's next.

1630
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,840
He firebombed his house.

1631
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,520
Now he's gonna kill
the chief of police.

1632
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,280
 Do we have any grounds
at all to doubt her?

1633
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,120
 Why would she lie, sir?

1634
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,600
There's no way to know
what Stephen might do

1635
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,840
if he found out she came to me.

1636
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,280
 Right.

1637
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,480
She doesn't have much of
a motive with any of this,

1638
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,720
does she?

1639
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,000
Can we pull him in now?

1640
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,680
 On what, a
four-year-old shooting?

1641
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,720
 Oh.

1642
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:50,160
A renegade cop.

1643
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,040
The media will lap this up.

1644
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,040
 Every one of these shootings
has been premeditated.

1645
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,160
If Smith has announced
his plans to gun you down,

1646
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,480
then we have to think
he's going to try.

1647
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,160
 Yeah.

1648
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:04,520
But can we subpoena his
wife before a grand jury

1649
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,240
and get her to tell her
story again to them?

1650
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:08,840
 Takes time to
convene a grand jury,

1651
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,720
and we don't know a heck of a
lot about Smith's timetable.

1652
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,080
 Well, look, he's
obviously nuts.

1653
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,520
Why can't we go to county mental
health, get him committed,

1654
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:19,360
and hold him there until you
can make your case against him?

1655
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:24,800
 Because Stephen would make
idiots out of those people.

1656
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,160
You remember the Civil
Service Commission?

1657
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:31,160
He conned me, my wife, his wife.

1658
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,160
Stephen could lie his
way straight out of hell.

1659
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:46,640
 Tucker, are you
willing to help us?

1660
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:52,960
 What do you mean, wear a wire?

1661
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:53,960
 It might work.

1662
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,080
 No, sir.

1663
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,080
I can't do that.

1664
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,800
I could put my
fist into his face.

1665
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,360
I could put him into a hospital.

1666
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,760
But I can't sneak
around on him like that.

1667
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,840
 Well, your friend didn't mind
doing that to you, now did he?

1668
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,720
 If you don't do it,
Tucker, the alternative

1669
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,000
could be pretty ugly.

1670
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,280
 And what is the
alternative, sir?

1671
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,760
 Put a team on him.

1672
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,520
Follow him, wait for
him to make his move.

1673
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:27,400
We have a sharpshooter.

1674
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,040
 So if I don't help
you bring him in then

1675
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,120
I help you execute him?

1676
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,120
Is that it?

1677
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,880
Is that it?

1678
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,720
 Now listen to me, son.

1679
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,120
Son.

1680
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,680
Listen to me.

1681
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,120
Stephen Smith has put
himself beyond the pale.

1682
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,560
You didn't put him there.

1683
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,840
No one else did.

1684
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,640
And a moment ago, you
were pretty angry.

1685
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:49,080
 Yeah, I'm angry, but
not just with Stephen.

1686
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:55,240
You know, in the academy, you
told us what made us special

1687
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,520
was our humanity.

1688
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,080
And from day one, our humanity
has been stripped away.

1689
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:13,760
I'll do it-- but not to
finish him off, to save him.

1690
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:16,560
[phone ringing]

1691
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,200
 Hello.

1692
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,840
Hey, cowboy.

1693
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,480
What's on that tiny
little mind of yours?

1694
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,440
She did?

1695
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,400
What'd she have to talk about?

1696
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:38,640
Yeah.

1697
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:39,960
Sure I would.

1698
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,560
I'd like to hear all about it.

1699
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,240
OK.

1700
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,640
Uh, 7 o'clock.

1701
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:47,440
You pick me up.

1702
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,360
[suspenseful music]

1703
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:29,920
 Honey.

1704
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,000
Might have to eat
a little later.

1705
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,480
 What is it?
Is someone wrong?

1706
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,920
 No, something
just come up and I'm

1707
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,240
going to have to deal with it.

1708
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:36,320
 You promised you'd
help me with history.

1709
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,440
 I'll be back before bedtime.

1710
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,520
Hey.

1711
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,960
 Aren't you staying for dinner?

1712
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:47,720
 Nope.

1713
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,080
But you go ahead, all right?

1714
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,200
 OK.

1715
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,720
 You mind yourself
while I'm gone.

1716
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,040
OK?
- OK.

1717
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:54,800
 OK.

1718
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,720
[suspenseful music]

1719
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:25,120
 You know, I was thinking that
Jimmy Dean's got a birthday

1720
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,400
coming up, doesn't he?

1721
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,120
How old's that boy gonna be?

1722
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,000
10?

1723
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,280
FARRELL: That's right.

1724
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:32,320
 You want to drive?

1725
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,560
 No, I drove over here.

1726
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,200
You can go ahead and drive.

1727
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,200
 Well, I got them
working on the carburetor,

1728
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:40,080
so we'll see how
bad I screwed it up.

1729
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,720
I'm glad you came by.

1730
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,240
I wasn't sure where things
stood with us anymore.

1731
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,480
 What's that supposed to mean?

1732
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:50,040
 The things you
said to me in jail.

1733
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:52,200
Made me feel like you didn't
believe in me anymore.

1734
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,840
 Should I believe
in you, Stephen?

1735
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:54,920
 Yeah, you should.

1736
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:55,720
Otherwise, what's the point?

1737
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,960
So what did old Lea have to say?

1738
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,120
[laughing] Can't live with
'em, can't live without 'em.

1739
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,760
Farrell.

1740
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:23,720
You're the one who knew
what I wanted to do.

1741
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:27,200
You're the only one who really
knew what I wanted to do.

1742
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,560
But it cost me.

1743
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,400
 What do you mean?

1744
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,760
 I mean that if you
lost faith in me--

1745
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,440
you know, don't you?

1746
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,440
Lea.

1747
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:57,360
She told you.

1748
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,600
And who have you talked to?

1749
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,920
What have you got, a .45?

1750
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:06,720
Give it to me.

1751
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,600
 Stephen.

1752
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,040
 Shh, quiet.

1753
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:17,840
Don't talk.

1754
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,360

 Stephen.

Stephen.
