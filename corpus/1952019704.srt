1
00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:32,328
WOMAN: " When he gave us
our air rifles,

2
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:34,594
Atticus wouldn't teach us
to shoot.

3
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:38,007
Uncle Jack instructed us in
the rudiments thereof.

4
00:00:38,023 --> 00:00:40,597
He said Atticus wasn't
interested in guns.

5
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:42,630
And Atticus said to Jem,

6
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:46,201
'I'd rather you shot at tin cans
in the backyard,

7
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:48,145
but I know you'll go
after the birds.

8
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,240
Shoot all the blue jays you want
if you can hit 'em,

9
00:00:51,283 --> 00:00:53,774
but remember it's a sin

10
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:57,812
to kill a mockingbird."'
(laughs)

11
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:19,636
Cody, take them feed sacks
to the barn.

12
00:01:19,678 --> 00:01:22,670
I think you want a ranch hand,
not a son-in-law.

13
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:26,081
You know, with you
I'd settle for either.

14
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:30,283
Where is my granddaughter?

15
00:01:30,322 --> 00:01:32,222
Where is she?
Come here, you.

16
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:33,747
Come here, you.

17
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:36,022
- (girl grunts)
- Yeah, there we go.

18
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:40,020
WOMAN: Easy, Dad.
She's not one of your roustabouts.

19
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:42,795
Well, she's a Banyon,
isn't she?

20
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:44,803
At least partways.

21
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:46,464
Best part, right, Grandpa?

22
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,405
You're not just whistling Dixie.

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,738
It's in your blood, little one.

24
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:54,735
And now listen, since you've
proven so astoundingly proficient

25
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,748
at naming horses,

26
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:59,979
like that little spindly-legged
rockhead of a colt out there...

27
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:03,510
- GIRL: Apache Wind.
- GRANDFATHER: Apache Wind.

28
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:06,023
Since you did that so much better
than I expected,

29
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:08,026
I find myself humbly in need

30
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,086
of your nomenclative
services once again.

31
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:16,167
(panting)

32
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:19,034
Whoa!
Not just so quick.

33
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:22,199
There is a protocol
to be observed.

34
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:26,143
You know the naming of a horse
or a son or daughter

35
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:28,169
or a granddaughter,
you know,

36
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:30,545
it's not just a name.

37
00:02:30,582 --> 00:02:33,016
I mean, a name's got
to mean something to you.

38
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:36,851
It's got to say,
"This is who I am in the world.

39
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:39,858
I am a force
to be reckoned with."

40
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,251
Okay.

41
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,531
Mom, a puppy!

42
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:51,934
A puppy?
That's not a puppy!

43
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,929
Belle, that is 25 generations
of the best breeding and bloodlines

44
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:59,137
and bearing that's ever
gone into four legs.

45
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,373
- That there is...
- Atticus.

46
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:03,313
- Who?
- Atticus.

47
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:05,748
Oh, Mom,
can we keep him, please?

48
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:08,879
Just a second, Belle.

49
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:12,755
I mean, I paid a lot of money
for this dog.

50
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,782
And he's gotta make me
some puppies

51
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:17,852
so that I can make
my money back.

52
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:19,955
Now what we could do

53
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:22,432
is you could visit him
anytime you want

54
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:25,868
and when the time's
a little righter,

55
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:28,338
you could have the pick
of the litter.

56
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:30,102
- Is that a deal?
- Deal.

57
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:31,734
Okay.

58
00:03:31,777 --> 00:03:35,110
Well, somebody's gotta do
some work around here.

59
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:38,472
- Bye, Dad.
- Mm-hmm.

60
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:54,392
"I asked Miss Maudie about it.

61
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:56,264
'Your father's right,' she said.

62
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:58,462
'Mockingbirds don't do one thing

63
00:03:58,503 --> 00:04:00,528
but make music
for us to enjoy.

64
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:03,598
They don't eat up
people's gardens,

65
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:06,167
don't nest in corn cribs.

66
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:09,203
They don't do one thing,
but sing their hearts out for us.

67
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,739
That's why it's a sin

68
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:14,149
to kill a mockingbird."'

69
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:21,190
(thunder crashing)

70
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:28,297
I love you, Cody.

71
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,529
Belle.

72
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:40,006
I love you, baby.
Cover up, honey.

73
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:48,513
- Oh, my God! (screams)
- (brakes screech)

74
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:51,420
(crashes)

75
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,247
- Daddy...
- Shh!

76
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:25,246
REVEREND: " And God shall
wipe away all tears

77
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:27,080
from their eyes,

78
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,917
and there shall be
death no more.

79
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:33,186
Neither sorrow nor crying,

80
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:36,922
neither shall there be
anymore pain.

81
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:40,329
For the former things
have passed away."

82
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:01,162
MAN:
Here you go.

83
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:11,279
Four, eight, a tenth.

84
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:13,546
Shoot, the man don't even
have a stopwatch.

85
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:16,986
He's got a stopwatch.
It's in his head.

86
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:21,648
You ought to taste
his three-minute eggs.

87
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:26,686
You did good today,
Apache Wind, real good.

88
00:09:30,902 --> 00:09:32,927
That's a beautiful horse, Hock.

89
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:35,769
And our consortium
is agreeable to your stud fees,

90
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:37,638
but we are a tad concerned

91
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:41,168
about your proposed
ownership percentages of the colt.

92
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:44,306
Frankly, we'd just as soon own
the two-year old outright.

93
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:46,943
That... that ain't chicken feed.

94
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:56,693
You know,
I can't read this right now.

95
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:58,719
I don't have my specs.

96
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,865
Oh, Mrs. Wimmer,
I am so sorry.

97
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:14,106
Oh, faddle, Lillian. Mr. Magoo
and I have nothing but time.

98
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:16,511
Isn't that right, Magoo?

99
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:18,641
Come on inside. Come on.

100
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:23,044
Mrs. Wimmer, Magoo isn't due
for his parvo booster

101
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:26,524
for another three months yet,
and even though I love seeing you,

102
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:30,426
as I told you yesterday,
he's the perfect picture of health.

103
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:32,987
(sighs)

104
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:35,556
Okay, just a quick look.

105
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,591
Come here, buddy.
How about some kisses?

106
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:39,126
You wanna give me
some kisses?

107
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,161
Oh, you're so cute.
You're so cute.

108
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:44,175
Oh, Magoo!

109
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:46,234
You did it again.

110
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:49,274
It's okay.

111
00:10:57,922 --> 00:11:00,948
I have never seen
such concentration.

112
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:03,620
GYM TEACHER: I wish she'd apply it
to her book work.

113
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:08,762
Hey, Belle,

114
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,394
you know who was asking
for you today?

115
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:13,427
Who?

116
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:15,462
Nobody!

117
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:37,995
You guys called me out here
for another crazy cat lady?

118
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:39,656
We'll just have to...

119
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,165
Why should we have
all the fun?

120
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:44,066
- 17 so far.
- There's one more through to the back.

121
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:46,627
Guys, I don't have time for this.
I've got my daughter's thing...

122
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:48,605
(cats meowing)

123
00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:00,509
- This cat got a name?
- She calls him Mrs. Snuffles.

124
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,543
It's through there.

125
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:06,484
Mrs. Snuffles!

126
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:08,424
Kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty.

127
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,923
(growls, snarls)

128
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:13,954
(laughing)

129
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,434
We got you.

130
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,699
Why don't we go
to my office?

131
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,728
What about my dad?

132
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,241
We can talk to him together.

133
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:26,202
- Went by the school.
- Good for you.

134
00:13:26,237 --> 00:13:28,432
You're supposed to wait for me.
That's the rule.

135
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:30,668
Rules change.

136
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,506
Mrs. Melton's pretty miffed
at you for skipping out on her.

137
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:36,105
She'll get over it.

138
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:40,347
Why don't you hop in?
I got another stop to make.

139
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:43,377
I want you to see what I got
in the back. It's pretty cool stuff.

140
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:46,356
I'd rather eat slugs.

141
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:49,758
I was thinking pizza,
but all right.

142
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:53,396
Belle, I'm sorry.

143
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:56,195
You're always sorry.
You invented sorry.

144
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:08,543
Well, you can't just let
her eat anything.

145
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,844
That's why they call it
cat food, Mr. Wong.

146
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:12,941
It's food for cats.

147
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:15,509
I've prescribed a low ash,
high-protein diet

148
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:18,283
and you keep giving Georgette
free range over the buffet table.

149
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:20,655
No no, no MSG.

150
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:23,217
That's good,
but no MSG hardly matters

151
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:26,492
when she's gorging herself
on dim sum and moo shu pork.

152
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:28,795
BIRD:
Here, kitty-kitty. Meow.

153
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:32,098
Did we ask
for your opinion?

154
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:38,198
Whew, what a day.

155
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:40,177
No kidding, right?

156
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:45,175
Are you sure
you won't change your mind?

157
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:48,845
All work and no play
makes Lillian one dull, single,

158
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:51,412
urban professional female.

159
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:54,289
It's Friday.
We'll hit Martini Corner,

160
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:57,089
a little dinner and a little music,

161
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:59,289
a little dancing.

162
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,061
Sounds great,
but I think I'll pass.

163
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:05,262
Oh, shoot.

164
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:10,332
The folks from
the Free Rural Clinic called.

165
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,936
They lost their venue.
It's been called off.

166
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:17,004
I'm sorry, Lil. I know how you like
to get out there

167
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:19,482
with the livestock,
you know, up to your knees

168
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:22,384
in the muck
and the cow patties.

169
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:26,557
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, thanks for a good day.

170
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:27,922
You too.

171
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,984
- Bye-bye, Vinny.
- Bye-bye.

172
00:15:30,028 --> 00:15:31,461
(sighs)

173
00:15:40,905 --> 00:15:42,736
Come on,
have some juice.

174
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:45,004
- Hello.
- Hey.

175
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:47,637
Well, hello, Vincent,
how's my bird?

176
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:50,876
- Hello.
- Bye-bye.

177
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:53,440
Contrary bird.

178
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:56,044
- What's in the box?
- Pigeon.

179
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:58,920
Oh! There are
eight million pigeons

180
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:01,482
- in the naked city.
- And this is one of them.

181
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:04,654
- The others didn't make it.
- When worlds collide?

182
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:05,822
Yeah, head on.

183
00:16:05,863 --> 00:16:08,525
So this one here seems
to have already fledged.

184
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:11,057
So I was wanting to know

185
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:13,764
if you would keep it
quarantined here

186
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:17,571
until I can take it out to
Wildlife Care, you know, just in case.

187
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:20,304
Little blood work
might be prudent.

188
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:22,779
(both gasp)

189
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:24,941
So what do you think?

190
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,951
Cody, it's not a baby pigeon.

191
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:30,216
It's a full-grown diamond dove.
It's Australian.

192
00:16:30,254 --> 00:16:32,415
Well, that is a long way

193
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:34,789
to come to get gassed,
little fella.

194
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:37,192
See the ring
around his eye?

195
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:39,355
Yeah. Wow.

196
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:42,127
Yeah, wow is good.

197
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:51,039
Well, I would do it myself,

198
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,407
- but I've got...
- Your Belle.

199
00:16:53,444 --> 00:16:54,968
My Belle.

200
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:56,640
I'd like to "wring" her.

201
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:59,878
How are things?

202
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:02,408
Oh, well, I'm pretty sure
I've slipped further down

203
00:17:02,453 --> 00:17:04,751
that formidable scale
of expectation,

204
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:07,280
if that's at all possible.

205
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:10,351
How long's it been now,
two years?

206
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:13,455
Yeah, almost to the day.

207
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:16,023
A girl her age

208
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:19,366
should only have
happy anniversaries.

209
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:21,133
And you?

210
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:23,231
I don't have time
for those kind of things.

211
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:25,265
I have a child to mis-raise.

212
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:29,413
So you have any plans tonight?

213
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,176
What did you have in mind?

214
00:17:31,215 --> 00:17:34,582
Don't panic.

215
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:36,348
My plans include a book
and a bath,

216
00:17:36,387 --> 00:17:39,447
and if I'm really adventurous,
maybe I'll have both at the same time.

217
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,025
Yeah, well,
good luck with that.

218
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:45,154
I'm out.

219
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:48,131
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

220
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:52,892
- Bye-bye, Vincent.
- Hello.

221
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:57,364
(sighs)

222
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:08,841
You know, whenever I get
the whole Belle thing leveled out,

223
00:18:08,886 --> 00:18:11,320
- some night you and I should...
- (beeper chiming)

224
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:12,822
I'm sorry.

225
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:16,726
Hmm.

226
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:18,319
You were saying?

227
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:20,922
I was saying that one
of these nights

228
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:23,832
- that you and I should...
- (cell phone rings)

229
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:25,631
Maybe we should?

230
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,468
Hello.

231
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:30,667
What?

232
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,801
They what?

233
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:34,835
I gotta take this.

234
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:40,073
Uh-huh.

235
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:43,543
Who was that?

236
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:47,782
Don't even ask,
feather britches.

237
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:02,895
Did you

238
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,204
scrub down Apache Wind?

239
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,177
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

240
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:12,913
You want some?

241
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,941
Dogs to be fed.

242
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:20,290
(chuckles)

243
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:23,521
You know,

244
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:25,927
there's not a living, breathing,

245
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,692
feed-swilling critter

246
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:31,293
on these 5,000
God-splashed acres

247
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:34,202
holds a candle
to Apache Wind.

248
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:39,240
And my daughter picked him out

249
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:42,144
when he was a colt,

250
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,014
because that girl
knew her horseflesh.

251
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:50,917
Ain't nothing black
as a Kansas night.

252
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:56,252
Black as a bull's heart.

253
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:59,991
A man ought not
to stand around ruminating

254
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:02,261
in such darkness.

255
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:22,853
(cats meowing)

256
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:25,355
- Who's on duty?
- Who do you think?

257
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,616
Milo.

258
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:32,858
(barking)

259
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:53,213
Hey, what the...

260
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:55,685
Hey, Cody.

261
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,314
- What's up, bro?
- What's up,

262
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:01,917
Milo, is that we have collected
17 cats in your sector

263
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,790
and you've refused delivery.

264
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:06,820
What's up, bro,
is my blood pressure.

265
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:08,798
It can't be helped.
You know what I'm saying?

266
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,358
I've got two guys pulling down
time and a half because of you.

267
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:13,199
You know my department
can't afford it.

268
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:15,364
Get out there and help them
with the cats, man, come on.

269
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:17,374
I don't have the room.
Know what I'm saying?

270
00:21:17,408 --> 00:21:19,569
Make the room, Milo.

271
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,579
I've been making
the room for four months.

272
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:24,478
Ever since they
shut down Number 2,

273
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:27,143
my place has become
the dumping ground

274
00:21:27,184 --> 00:21:29,118
for half the city.

275
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:30,882
If you want to talk budget,

276
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:32,821
I can barely feed
what I've got.

277
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:35,724
I don't have the room.
You know what I'm saying?

278
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,728
Do your job.

279
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:41,095
Do my job, okay.

280
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:42,599
Okay.

281
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:45,625
Oh, you know what?

282
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,764
This is not gonna be enough, but I think
I have some more in the back.

283
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:50,398
What are you doing?

284
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:52,636
Just what you asked me to do.
Know what I'm saying?

285
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:55,840
No, I don't know
what you're saying, Milo,

286
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,246
because you don't know
what you're saying.

287
00:21:58,282 --> 00:22:00,750
I need more Xylazine and Pento

288
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:03,618
because if I'm gonna do my job,

289
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:05,621
I gotta clear out 17 more cages.

290
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:07,624
And the only way
that's gonna happen

291
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:11,219
is if I "make the room."

292
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:13,958
This puts 'em down.

293
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:15,989
This takes 'em out.

294
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,591
Are you gonna come help me,

295
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:21,196
or you gonna stand there
being all righteous and loud?

296
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:46,859
(bell dings)

297
00:22:55,506 --> 00:22:57,633
What can I do to you?

298
00:22:57,675 --> 00:22:59,836
Oh, I just need a room.

299
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:03,574
I hope you got cash.

300
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:06,811
Damn swipey things
haven't worked since '86.

301
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:08,614
Or was it '85?

302
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:12,723
When was the last time
the Royals lost last place?

303
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:14,987
I just need a room.

304
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:18,256
It'd be better if we got one
in the back.

305
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:28,467
Well...

306
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,433
far be it for me to judge.

307
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:42,147
(kisses)

308
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:01,138
(cats meowing)

309
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:07,635
Shh!

310
00:24:53,123 --> 00:24:56,752
Look, kiddo, my day wasn't exactly
candy and nuts either.

311
00:25:05,736 --> 00:25:08,830
Belle, you're not in trouble.

312
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:11,501
Mrs. Melton is just concerned

313
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:13,567
that your grades have slipped
since...

314
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:20,642
that your grades
have slipped

315
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:24,643
and you're punting away
all your extracurricular activities

316
00:25:24,688 --> 00:25:27,919
and this whole
Greta Garbo routine.

317
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,290
Oh, I feel like I'm talking to myself.

318
00:25:35,332 --> 00:25:37,698
You know what, Belle?
Have it your way, okay?

319
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:07,831
MAN ON TV: And in a role reversal
quite rare in the animal...

320
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:18,441
Oh, man, oh.

321
00:26:18,475 --> 00:26:20,773
Really?

322
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:22,608
Oh, great.

323
00:26:25,082 --> 00:26:28,142
Hey. Hey, lonesome.

324
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:31,211
Come here, huh?

325
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:34,588
Did you spot the perps?
Huh?

326
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:38,220
See who did this?

327
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:40,287
(sighs)

328
00:26:42,132 --> 00:26:44,293

329
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:50,702
(ringing)

330
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:52,732
(beeper chiming)

331
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:02,645
Hello.

332
00:27:02,686 --> 00:27:04,586
What?

333
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,988
- You're kidding me. Hold on.
- (cell phone rings)

334
00:27:07,024 --> 00:27:08,855
Yeah, hold on.
Hold on.

335
00:27:10,995 --> 00:27:13,486
Hello. Yeah.
Yeah, I just heard.

336
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,260
Look, don't yell at me.
Yeah.

337
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,758
Okay okay okay, I'm on it.
I'm on it.

338
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:47,328
Look, get dressed.
I'll take you by school.

339
00:27:47,364 --> 00:27:50,891
Okay, except it's Saturday.

340
00:27:55,172 --> 00:27:57,936
Come on.

341
00:27:57,975 --> 00:27:59,533
Lil.

At least 30 dogs were set free...

344
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,978
MAN ON RADIO:
Whoa! Look out, Kansas City.

345
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:08,348

- This is for all you puppies on parole.

346
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:26,966
Walk with me.

347
00:28:27,004 --> 00:28:29,939
You're turning my city
into a flea circus.

348
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:33,909
It's my job to catch 'em,
not to tuck 'em into bed at night.

349
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:37,744
What's the point of catching them
if you can't keep them?

350
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:40,079
Need I remind you that by some

351
00:28:40,117 --> 00:28:42,984
archaic municipal flaw
in our legal system,

352
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,181
yours is an elected position.

353
00:28:45,222 --> 00:28:48,419
- Are you threatening me?
- Absolutely.

354
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:50,859
I want to see every one
of those mutts behind bars

355
00:28:50,894 --> 00:28:52,919
by the end
of business today.

356
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:56,091
And I want you
to make sure it never happens again.

357
00:28:57,701 --> 00:29:00,761
We're on Imus,
for God's sake.

358
00:29:00,804 --> 00:29:03,102
The whole country's
laughing at us.

359
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,507
Mr. Dennison,
are any of the dogs...

360
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,909
LILY: Yeah, no, great.
2:00 is fine. Thank you.

361
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:19,721
So how's school?

362
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:21,554
It's there.

363
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:24,959
I hear you're quite
the little gymnast.

364
00:29:24,995 --> 00:29:27,657
I like gymnastics.
You could do it alone.

365
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:31,834
Can I feed Vinny?

366
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:34,167
Oh, sure.

367
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:42,477
Want a cracker?

368
00:29:42,513 --> 00:29:45,038
It's not a cracker.
It's a...

369
00:29:46,283 --> 00:29:48,274
- French fry?
- (laughing)

370
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,916
Why doesn't he fly away?

371
00:29:53,957 --> 00:29:55,982
Oh, he can't.

372
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:01,164
You clipped his wings?

373
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:03,189
I don't think that's right.

374
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:08,003
(clears throat)

375
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,566
- (clucks) Pretty wings.
- Such a pretty bird.

376
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:16,306
You see, birds,
they have a radius and an ulna

377
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:19,747
just like people do.
And your hand is like his feathers.

378
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:22,251
But right here
where the radius meets the carpus...

379
00:30:22,286 --> 00:30:24,880
it's basically like your wrist...
Vinny's is broken.

380
00:30:24,922 --> 00:30:27,652
- VINNY: Uh-oh.
- You couldn't fix it?

381
00:30:27,691 --> 00:30:30,182
No, by the time
your dad found him

382
00:30:30,227 --> 00:30:32,593
his bones had already knitted
in all the wrong places.

383
00:30:32,629 --> 00:30:35,962
Vinny, poor guy,
he was not in a good place.

384
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:38,991
Were you, pal?
All he did was scream

385
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:41,630
and scratch and claw,

386
00:30:41,672 --> 00:30:43,606
but your dad,

387
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,074
he sat up with him
for three weeks straight,

388
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:48,805
hand-feeding him,
bringing up his weight,

389
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:51,474
teaching him it was okay
to trust people again.

390
00:30:52,716 --> 00:30:56,117
I mean, it's really amazing
that he can be handled at all.

391
00:30:56,153 --> 00:30:58,121
By all rights,
he really should have been...

392
00:30:58,155 --> 00:30:59,986
Put down.

393
00:31:00,023 --> 00:31:02,014
Yeah.

394
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,557
Why should Vinny be any different
from all the other animals he kills?

395
00:31:06,597 --> 00:31:08,155
Honey, euthanasia...

396
00:31:08,198 --> 00:31:10,166
Call it what it is, Lily.

397
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,862
Killing is killing.
And my father...

398
00:31:12,903 --> 00:31:15,064
Your father is...

399
00:31:25,282 --> 00:31:27,079
"There are some men
in this world

400
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:30,018
who are born
to do our unpleasant jobs for us.

401
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:32,248
Your father is one of them."

402
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:34,951
You think you're the only young woman
who's ever read this book?

403
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:40,623
You see this money?
These donations?

404
00:31:40,664 --> 00:31:43,326
This is your dad's project.
You know that, right?

405
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:45,460
He's been promising that
for years.

406
00:31:45,502 --> 00:31:48,494
Like all his promises,
nothing ever comes of it.

407
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:50,335
Sweetie, I think
you don't understand.

408
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:52,899
You don't understand.

409
00:31:52,943 --> 00:31:55,776
You don't kill things
because they're broken.

410
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:59,748
You don't kill things because
they're sick or hurt or dying!

411
00:31:59,783 --> 00:32:02,274
You don't kill things
because it's easier.

412
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,753
You give things a chance.

413
00:32:04,788 --> 00:32:06,813
You don't know
what'll ever happen.

414
00:32:06,857 --> 00:32:09,348
You just don't ever know.

415
00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:11,623
Belle.

416
00:32:14,998 --> 00:32:16,863
Belle.

417
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,130
(crying)

418
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:21,069
Mrs. Wimmer.

419
00:32:21,104 --> 00:32:24,267
You said he was
in perfect health.

420
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:27,675
A perfect picture of health.

421
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:30,441
Oh, Mrs. Wimmer,
I'm so sorry.

422
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,118
Oh, I'm so sorry.

423
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:46,122
I don't know. I lost count.

424
00:32:46,163 --> 00:32:48,791
I'll do a count later. Head count
of the dogs, I'll let you know.

425
00:32:48,832 --> 00:32:50,993
- Just keep your cell on, okay?
- All right.

426
00:32:51,034 --> 00:32:52,831
- Cody, a word.
- Sure.

427
00:32:54,571 --> 00:32:57,335
That warehouse across
the street... don't look.

428
00:32:57,374 --> 00:32:59,740
They've got a roof-mounted
surveillance camera

429
00:32:59,776 --> 00:33:01,903
on a continuous
30-second sweep.

430
00:33:01,945 --> 00:33:04,880
That... that's great.

431
00:33:04,915 --> 00:33:08,112
Isn't it nice to think so?

432
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:10,176
I don't know if I can keep this
from breaking.

433
00:33:14,024 --> 00:33:16,424
Finish your homework?

434
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,122
It doesn't matter.
School's out in a week.

435
00:33:19,162 --> 00:33:22,563
- What do you want to do tonight?
- Whatever.

436
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:25,591
I was thinking we would watch a movie.
What do you think about that?

437
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:29,706
- Whatever.
- I rented this really really great one.

438
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,571
You're gonna love it.
I hear it's a sizzler.

439
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:33,633
It's called "The Great Escape."

440
00:33:44,187 --> 00:33:45,848
CODY: You know,

441
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:48,619
one of those dogs
that you released

442
00:33:48,658 --> 00:33:51,456
bit a crossing guard.

443
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:56,226
And another one got hit
by a city dump truck.

444
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:58,564
He's deader than disco.

445
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:04,172
Yeah, whatever.

446
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:10,179
(telephone rings)

447
00:34:12,582 --> 00:34:14,482
Yeah?

448
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:16,247
Cody.

449
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,081
She what?

450
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:30,324
Well, what do you want me
to do about it?

451
00:34:32,903 --> 00:34:35,701
Oh no, Cody,
I don't think that's a good idea.

452
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,297
Come on, Hock.

453
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,672
When have I ever
asked you for anything?

454
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:41,836
This is important.

455
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:45,712
Well, a couple days maybe.

456
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,785
- I'm not a babysitter.
- (beeps)

457
00:35:32,395 --> 00:35:35,091
BELLE: I still can't believe
you're packing me off to Grandpa's.

458
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:37,965
It's just until
all this nonsense dies down.

459
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:40,231
We've only seen
him once since...

460
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,762
Since the funeral. I know.
That's all about to change.

461
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:46,037
He doesn't want me there.

462
00:35:46,076 --> 00:35:49,944
- Of course he does.
- He doesn't. He's different.

463
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,971
Sweetheart,
we're all different now.

464
00:35:52,015 --> 00:35:55,041
Grandpa handles it his way,
I deal with it my way

465
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:57,451
and, Lord knows,
you deal with it your way.

466
00:35:57,487 --> 00:35:59,114
Here's an idea out of left field.

467
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:01,056
How about we all deal
with it together?

468
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:24,236
HOCK: Cody.

469
00:36:27,817 --> 00:36:31,378
- Hi, Grandpa.
- HOCK: Young lady.

470
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:34,015
- Where should I put her bags?
- Put 'em right inside the door.

471
00:36:34,057 --> 00:36:35,581
Good to see you, Hock.

472
00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:45,495
It's good to see you,
Grandpa.

473
00:36:45,535 --> 00:36:48,470
Young lady,
I won't put up with your tomfoolery.

474
00:36:58,081 --> 00:37:00,208
(sighs)

475
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:08,419
Belle Mae Lawler,

476
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,517
your life is over.

477
00:37:12,562 --> 00:37:15,463
- Atticus!
- (barking)

478
00:37:15,498 --> 00:37:16,692
What is it?

479
00:37:18,802 --> 00:37:20,827
Okay, boy, okay.
Okay.

480
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:27,939
Be good for your grandpa, okay?

481
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:30,708
I'll call and check in
on you every couple days.

482
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,241
I love you.

483
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:39,915
"I love you too, Dad.

484
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:42,356
I'm gonna miss you."

485
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:44,451
Come on, Atticus,
let's go inside the house.

486
00:37:44,494 --> 00:37:47,657
Dogs stay outside.

487
00:37:47,697 --> 00:37:49,722
But it's Atticus.

488
00:37:49,766 --> 00:37:52,030
Dogs stay outside.

489
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:56,902
Hey! Out there.

490
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,810
- Hey, Poovey.
- Shh!

491
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:13,246
Ha!

492
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:17,192
Hey, listen, I am gonna need that room
for a couple more days.

493
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:20,663
Being you're my sole-est
and only-est tenant,

494
00:38:20,697 --> 00:38:22,722
I'm sure we can work
something out.

495
00:38:22,766 --> 00:38:25,200
I got a question.

496
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:28,396
How do you survive out here?

497
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:31,339
It ain't about surviving.

498
00:38:31,374 --> 00:38:33,706
It's about being useful.

499
00:38:33,743 --> 00:38:36,337
This place used
to be useful.

500
00:38:36,379 --> 00:38:39,007
For 40 years, me and the missus
used to give respite

501
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:42,815
to the weary in the night:
long-haul truckers,

502
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:45,548
kids going back and forth
from school;

503
00:38:45,588 --> 00:38:47,453
learning things
I'll never know,

504
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,583
seeing things
I'll never see.

505
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:53,357
But I seen some things.

506
00:38:53,396 --> 00:38:56,593
I seen fireballs

507
00:38:56,633 --> 00:39:00,069
and freight trains barreling
through the night.

508
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:02,901
I seen drummers
selling everything,

509
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:06,136
Fuller Brush, tin houses.

510
00:39:08,311 --> 00:39:10,074
I seen...

511
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:14,408
I seen it raining
not more than 30 feet

512
00:39:14,451 --> 00:39:17,249
from where I'm standing,

513
00:39:17,287 --> 00:39:20,450
pouring down like God
wet his pants.

514
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:24,119
But right there the sun was shining
plain as your dopey face.

515
00:39:25,762 --> 00:39:29,425
Now I know it's got to happen
somewhere every time it rains,

516
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:31,798
but this time it was
happening to me.

517
00:39:34,337 --> 00:39:38,296
Anyways, they put
the new highway in and poof.

518
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,802
It all turns to dust anyway.

519
00:39:43,847 --> 00:39:47,339
It stings not being useful.

520
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:54,287
Well, I'm gonna get going.

521
00:39:54,324 --> 00:39:57,816
Well, I seen a duck
hit by lightning.

522
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:01,920
I'll see you tomorrow.

523
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:04,661
Son, if you've got things
you need to do... and you got the look

524
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:07,033
of a man who has things
he needs to do...

525
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,005
I can check in on that convention
of critters you left

526
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:12,132
in my presidential suite.

527
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:18,472
King me.

528
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:26,014
- Bye, Poovey.
- Cody...

529
00:40:27,924 --> 00:40:30,654
you know that duck
I was talking about?

530
00:40:30,693 --> 00:40:32,320
It was delicious.

531
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,895
Curtis, this dog
should not be dead.

532
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:39,868
She didn't get out,
get into anything?

533
00:40:39,903 --> 00:40:43,464
She's fenced in all day
and comes in at night.

534
00:40:44,774 --> 00:40:46,742
She get along
with the neighbors?

535
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:49,836
They love her.

536
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:52,712
What about her diet?
Anything new or irregular?

537
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:56,048
Same since
she was a puppy.

538
00:40:57,921 --> 00:40:59,889
I'm so sorry, Curtis.

539
00:40:59,923 --> 00:41:02,483
I'm gonna ask your permission
to do something.

540
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:04,493
It won't help your Elize here,

541
00:41:04,527 --> 00:41:07,724
but it might help some others.

542
00:41:07,764 --> 00:41:10,824
If you think it'll help.

543
00:41:10,867 --> 00:41:13,427
Thank you.

544
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,908
Breakfast at 5:30.

545
00:41:22,946 --> 00:41:24,914
Be there if you want any.

546
00:41:26,416 --> 00:41:28,008
This was mom's room.

547
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:31,179
(sighs)

548
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:34,190
It's just a room.

549
00:41:36,726 --> 00:41:38,717
(Atticus barking)

550
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:46,297
Shoo! Get out of here.

551
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:52,036
Okay okay, I'm coming, boy.

552
00:42:11,127 --> 00:42:13,220
You're a daddy!

553
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:18,324
This is Scout

554
00:42:18,368 --> 00:42:20,359
and...

555
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:22,963
you're Calpurnia

556
00:42:23,006 --> 00:42:26,237
and you're Boo

557
00:42:26,276 --> 00:42:29,006
and you're Miss Maudie.

558
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:30,637
(growling)

559
00:42:33,383 --> 00:42:35,613
What is it, boy?

560
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:44,183
They don't name nothing
around here no more.

561
00:42:45,595 --> 00:42:48,291
Come on, Atticus.
Walk me home.

562
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,338
Hey, we gotta get that
grain chute unstuck.

563
00:42:56,372 --> 00:42:58,272
That dust is gonna build up.
Kaboom!

564
00:42:58,308 --> 00:42:59,536
Leonard was supposed
to fix that.

565
00:42:59,576 --> 00:43:01,203
Leonard's as dumb
as a post.

566
00:43:01,244 --> 00:43:03,474
Leonard ain't dumb
as a post.

567
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,543
He's dumb as a post hole.

568
00:43:14,324 --> 00:43:16,554
Don't just stand there
like a clubbed catfish.

569
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:18,857
Get yourself a plate.

570
00:43:18,895 --> 00:43:20,795
Gentlemen,

571
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:23,993
this is
my granddaughter Belle.

572
00:43:24,033 --> 00:43:25,830
Now Belle...

573
00:43:25,868 --> 00:43:28,496
has some unusual ideas
about things.

574
00:43:28,538 --> 00:43:32,133
And she's here to have
an attitude adjustment.

575
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:34,666
And she will earn her keep

576
00:43:34,711 --> 00:43:37,043
and if she doesn't,
I want to hear about it.

577
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,411
Pronto.

578
00:43:38,448 --> 00:43:40,814
Somebody's gotta do
some work around here.

579
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,875
And when you're done
with the dishes,

580
00:43:42,919 --> 00:43:45,854
you can start
on the compost.

581
00:44:21,658 --> 00:44:25,253
Nothing will cripple
a million-dollar horse worse

582
00:44:25,294 --> 00:44:27,524
than a 10¢ gopher hole.

583
00:44:57,427 --> 00:45:00,487
But I can see my face in it.

584
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:03,761
Let me know when you
can see your thoughts.

585
00:45:52,248 --> 00:45:55,012
They're horses, not hamsters.

586
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:57,212
When you're born to run, you run.

587
00:45:57,253 --> 00:46:00,882
How do they keep
such a steady pace?

588
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:02,891
They got incentive.

589
00:46:04,427 --> 00:46:07,794
When they get too close
to the front or back,

590
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:10,492
they get...

591
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:12,296
an electrical reminder.

592
00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:14,565
You shock them?

593
00:46:14,604 --> 00:46:17,072
More scares 'em than hurts.

594
00:46:20,376 --> 00:46:22,037
What is it?

595
00:46:22,078 --> 00:46:24,979
You are just always
in the way.

596
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:30,909
This your cat?

597
00:46:33,156 --> 00:46:36,717
Some say cats
got nine lives.

598
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:39,660
Old Linus here got 12.

599
00:46:39,695 --> 00:46:42,425
Run over him twice myself.

600
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:45,434
There's something in that maybe...

601
00:46:45,468 --> 00:46:47,902
like in not counting
yourself out.

602
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:53,566
Oh, speaking of counting
yourself out.

603
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:56,879
I'm a little short this week.

604
00:46:56,913 --> 00:47:00,007
You got nothing to count.

605
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:09,247
I'd appreciate two coats
on the outside.

606
00:47:10,726 --> 00:47:13,718
- Two?
- Two.

607
00:47:13,763 --> 00:47:16,391
Two.

608
00:47:16,432 --> 00:47:18,400
- Two.
- Two.

609
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:27,441
Oh my gosh.

610
00:47:29,011 --> 00:47:31,605
Oh my gosh,
that is so cool.

611
00:47:53,703 --> 00:47:55,967
(sighs)

612
00:47:59,342 --> 00:48:02,436
The suspensory ligament's torn.

613
00:48:04,313 --> 00:48:06,838
She's dog food.

614
00:48:09,585 --> 00:48:12,145
She's not really dog food.

615
00:48:12,188 --> 00:48:15,282
No, honey, we don't do that.

616
00:48:15,324 --> 00:48:18,384
When they work hard
for the farm, they get

617
00:48:18,427 --> 00:48:21,157
respectful internment.

618
00:48:25,701 --> 00:48:28,033
I'll show you soon enough.

619
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:39,273
The horseshoes are all
upside down.

620
00:48:39,315 --> 00:48:42,546
Hock says it's 'cause
their luck run out.

621
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:45,145
I say it's 'cause
they just heading

622
00:48:45,187 --> 00:48:46,848
in another direction.

623
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:49,619
You bury them there?

624
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:52,219
Not all of 'em.

625
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:55,890
Them there are the 4H Club.

626
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:58,457
We only bury the halter,

627
00:48:58,501 --> 00:49:01,493
hooves, head, heart.

628
00:49:02,805 --> 00:49:04,796
Come on.

629
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,951
(sighs)

630
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,629
You got any ideas, pal?

631
00:49:31,667 --> 00:49:33,965
(squawks)

632
00:49:34,003 --> 00:49:36,870
Yeah.

633
00:49:36,906 --> 00:49:38,965
Me neither.

634
00:49:48,417 --> 00:49:50,408
Open the door.

635
00:49:57,259 --> 00:50:00,558
He used to be so brown
when he was a baby,

636
00:50:00,596 --> 00:50:03,429
like the color
of a shiny new penny.

637
00:50:03,466 --> 00:50:06,492
They all born wet and dark.

638
00:50:06,535 --> 00:50:08,503
Don't show their true color,

639
00:50:08,537 --> 00:50:10,471
the color they keep,

640
00:50:10,506 --> 00:50:12,599
till almost
one year sometime too.

641
00:50:14,877 --> 00:50:17,368
I was born purple and blue.

642
00:50:17,413 --> 00:50:19,472
You was born...

643
00:50:19,515 --> 00:50:22,575
I was born what?

644
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,018
Ornery.

645
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:29,081
But theoretically
free from sin.

646
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,351
Let's go.

647
00:51:00,189 --> 00:51:03,590
Dude, how much more stuff
do I gotta do around this morgue?

648
00:51:03,626 --> 00:51:05,287
A lot more than that.

649
00:51:05,327 --> 00:51:07,591
Yeah, but this is not
in my job description.

650
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,962
Your job description reads
as follows, Milo:

651
00:51:09,999 --> 00:51:13,059
You do what I say to do
until I tell you to stop doing it

652
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:15,127
or else I can your lazy butt.

653
00:51:15,171 --> 00:51:18,436
Ooh-hoo. You know, if we had
a union, I would totally...

654
00:51:18,474 --> 00:51:19,941
What, what?

655
00:51:19,975 --> 00:51:23,103
I'd join it
and then I'd go on strike.

656
00:51:23,145 --> 00:51:25,705
You are a mountain
of dreams, Milo.

657
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:29,377
Okay, hey, guess what?
You're feeding my dog.

658
00:51:29,418 --> 00:51:31,545
You got it.

659
00:51:31,587 --> 00:51:33,077
MILO: Yeah, mm-hmm.

660
00:51:33,122 --> 00:51:35,784
Eggshell white
or autumn frost?

661
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:37,690
For what?

662
00:51:37,726 --> 00:51:40,456
My bathroom.

663
00:51:40,496 --> 00:51:43,693
Go with the eggshell white

664
00:51:43,732 --> 00:51:46,326
and mind the spiders.

665
00:51:46,368 --> 00:51:49,496
I wouldn't write off
the autumn frost just yet.

666
00:51:49,538 --> 00:51:51,870
- I mean, that's a nice...
- Get away from me.

667
00:51:54,743 --> 00:51:56,734
Milo.

668
00:52:04,687 --> 00:52:07,247
Come on.

669
00:52:12,928 --> 00:52:15,829
Working dogs...
attachments ruin 'em.

670
00:52:15,865 --> 00:52:17,833
Make 'em all fuzzle-headed.

671
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:20,165
Coddling gets them
misdirected.

672
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:23,137
Hock don't like
no misdirected dogs.

673
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:25,231
Hock likes his dogs
to stay on task.

674
00:52:42,525 --> 00:52:45,016
(barking)

675
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:48,086
Shoo! Go on!

676
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:49,722
Shoo!

677
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:55,000
Dumb dog.

678
00:52:55,037 --> 00:52:57,028
What's the matter with you?

679
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,111
Whoa!

680
00:53:13,155 --> 00:53:15,123
Never you walk
behind a horse

681
00:53:15,157 --> 00:53:17,125
without you letting him
know you're there.

682
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:19,684
Now you show him
that respect.

683
00:53:19,728 --> 00:53:23,323
Maybe he won't kick your head
clear off your shoulders.

684
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:30,070
Afraid of lions?

685
00:53:30,105 --> 00:53:32,630
Lions?

686
00:53:32,675 --> 00:53:35,803
Had a vet here once

687
00:53:35,844 --> 00:53:38,779
swore he'd rather get chewed on
by a lion than kicked by a horse.

688
00:53:38,814 --> 00:53:41,214
A lion make you bleed.

689
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,275
Maybe you can fix that.

690
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:45,378
But one kick from a horse

691
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:47,412
and you're crossing Jordan
on a jet-ski.

692
00:53:53,028 --> 00:53:55,019
It's Sunday.

693
00:54:15,985 --> 00:54:17,976
(screams)

694
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,487
Mm, man, this is good.

695
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,726
Get up here.

696
00:55:02,064 --> 00:55:05,363
Is there an earthly reason
for this absurdity?

697
00:55:07,069 --> 00:55:09,162
I wanted to know how it felt.

698
00:55:09,204 --> 00:55:12,662
How what felt?

699
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:15,734
How it felt to be...

700
00:55:15,778 --> 00:55:17,541
how it felt to be trapped,

701
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:20,173
trapped and alone
and stuck in circles.

702
00:55:20,215 --> 00:55:23,343
Uh-huh.

703
00:55:23,385 --> 00:55:25,751
Is that how you think
about my horses?

704
00:55:25,788 --> 00:55:27,585
No.

705
00:55:27,623 --> 00:55:29,853
That's how I see me.

706
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:35,223
That's expensive equipment.

707
00:55:35,264 --> 00:55:38,290
Don't toy with it.

708
00:56:00,122 --> 00:56:02,420
(laughing)

709
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:04,449
Hey, bud.

710
00:56:12,634 --> 00:56:16,263
Yeah. (kisses)

711
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:32,917
- Tobias.
- Thanks, boss.

712
00:56:32,955 --> 00:56:35,480
Yeah. Satch.

713
00:56:35,524 --> 00:56:37,321
Thank you, Hock.

714
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,384
- Doc.
- Thank you, sir.

715
00:56:41,029 --> 00:56:43,020
Belle.

716
00:56:50,539 --> 00:56:52,530
Thank you, Grandpa.

717
00:56:56,745 --> 00:56:58,736
I think you've earned that.

718
00:57:06,321 --> 00:57:09,188
Mom loved animals,
didn't she?

719
00:57:09,224 --> 00:57:11,749
No, she did not.

720
00:57:11,794 --> 00:57:14,194
Animals ain't
for loving, honey.

721
00:57:14,229 --> 00:57:17,323
Animals are for eating
and wearing,

722
00:57:17,366 --> 00:57:21,268
for bill paying
and empire building.

723
00:57:21,303 --> 00:57:23,828
Your mother understood animals.

724
00:57:23,872 --> 00:57:26,170
She appreciated animals.

725
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:28,608
She respected animals.

726
00:57:28,644 --> 00:57:31,204
She did not love animals.

727
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,413
Look at her face.
She loved them.

728
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:43,892
Put that back, honey.
I'm not wearing my glasses. I can't...

729
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:56,264
- Grandpa.
- What?

730
00:57:56,305 --> 00:57:59,240
Do animals have souls?

731
00:57:59,274 --> 00:58:03,176
- What in the world?
- Do they?

732
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:05,339
I'll tell you
what animals have.

733
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,315
Animals have increasing
production costs

734
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:10,215
and they've got infuriatingly

735
00:58:10,252 --> 00:58:12,982
fluctuating market value.

736
00:58:13,021 --> 00:58:15,251
As to whether or not
they got souls,

737
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:17,622
I'll leave that to our good

738
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:19,854
and capricious creator
to determine.

739
00:58:19,895 --> 00:58:22,864
Aren't you up past
your bedtime?

740
00:58:22,898 --> 00:58:24,866
I know they have souls.

741
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,868
And how would
you know that?

742
00:58:26,902 --> 00:58:29,427
Well, can you imagine heaven

743
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:31,302
without them?

744
00:58:36,778 --> 00:58:39,144
Your mother liked animals fine.

745
00:58:39,181 --> 00:58:41,979
You're not the big old
ugly bear you think you are.

746
00:58:42,017 --> 00:58:44,417
- Yeah?
- No.

747
00:58:44,453 --> 00:58:46,648
Don't spread it around.

748
00:58:55,697 --> 00:58:58,427
You gave Mom this book.

749
00:58:58,467 --> 00:59:00,662
She said you used
to read it to her every night.

750
00:59:00,702 --> 00:59:03,671
She was mistaken. It was your
grandmother. I never read it.

751
00:59:03,705 --> 00:59:05,605
It was you.

752
00:59:05,641 --> 00:59:08,109
And she gave it to me
and she read it to me.

753
00:59:08,143 --> 00:59:10,111
It's a book about a bird.

754
00:59:10,145 --> 00:59:12,943
No, it's about how it's a sin
to kill a bird. Atticus says...

755
00:59:12,981 --> 00:59:15,950
Do you believe anything
that a lawyer says to you?

756
00:59:15,984 --> 00:59:17,918
And if it's a sin to kill a bird
then it's a sin to kill...

757
00:59:17,953 --> 00:59:21,650
Atticus took Heck Tate's rifle

758
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:23,521
and he shot that rabid dog

759
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:26,187
right in between the eyes.

760
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:28,093
And on that note,

761
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:30,826
I bid thee farewell.

762
00:59:30,866 --> 00:59:33,494
Not bad for someone
who's never read the book.

763
00:59:49,017 --> 00:59:51,485
After mine moved on
to a greener pasture,

764
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,385
I wore my ring too,

765
00:59:53,422 --> 00:59:57,188
till I realized

766
00:59:57,225 --> 01:00:00,683
it's not conducive
to my social situation.

767
01:00:03,065 --> 01:00:05,625
Well, I brought enough
feline leukemia

768
01:00:05,667 --> 01:00:07,658
for your touring show of cats,

769
01:00:07,703 --> 01:00:09,295
but you didn't mention dogs.

770
01:00:09,338 --> 01:00:12,774
This one's got an aural hematoma.
It's probably benign though.

771
01:00:14,176 --> 01:00:17,668
Well, he just
kind of showed up.

772
01:00:17,713 --> 01:00:19,840
A dog knows, don't he?

773
01:00:19,881 --> 01:00:21,371
This one might.

774
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:23,714
I tell you, a dog knows.

775
01:00:23,752 --> 01:00:26,414
The missus had an affliction...

776
01:00:26,455 --> 01:00:29,185
a touch of epilepsy.

777
01:00:29,224 --> 01:00:32,216
When a spell
was gonna come on,

778
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:36,390
my old dachshund would tie her up
so she couldn't move.

779
01:00:36,431 --> 01:00:39,662
A dog knows, don't he?

780
01:00:39,701 --> 01:00:42,101
You know what?
Some dogs have been proven

781
01:00:42,137 --> 01:00:44,105
to detect heart attacks

782
01:00:44,139 --> 01:00:46,767
and seizures, even traces
of bacteria in people.

783
01:00:46,808 --> 01:00:49,504
There have been dozens
of documented cases

784
01:00:49,544 --> 01:00:52,479
of what you might call
canine precognition.

785
01:00:53,882 --> 01:00:56,646
Well, if that means the same
as a dog knows,

786
01:00:56,685 --> 01:00:58,949
why don't you just say it?

787
01:00:58,987 --> 01:01:02,582
LILY: A necropsy revealed nothing,
at least nothing I could discern.

788
01:01:02,624 --> 01:01:04,922
And what's worse,
they keep coming.

789
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,986
I had two more DOA's last week.

790
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:09,759
I talked to some
of my colleagues

791
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:11,823
and they said the incidents
are isolated

792
01:01:11,867 --> 01:01:13,858
to the north side, thank God.

793
01:01:13,902 --> 01:01:17,736
So I shipped a couple
of the carcasses off to K State.

794
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:19,536
Yeah, they're great.

795
01:01:19,574 --> 01:01:21,166
I have got to figure this out.

796
01:01:21,209 --> 01:01:23,234
I mean,
that's what I'm here for, right?

797
01:01:23,278 --> 01:01:25,769
Right?

798
01:01:25,814 --> 01:01:28,715
Hello.
Ground Control to Major Mopey.

799
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:32,987
I miss her so much.

800
01:01:33,021 --> 01:01:36,013
God bless her little
juvenile-delinquent heart.

801
01:01:38,593 --> 01:01:41,994
What's not to miss?

802
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:43,725
She loathes me.

803
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:49,366
Come on,
she's probably dying to see you.

804
01:01:49,404 --> 01:01:51,395
Yeah.

805
01:02:02,684 --> 01:02:04,948
- Daddy!
- Hi, baby.

806
01:02:09,191 --> 01:02:10,852
I shoed a horse.

807
01:02:10,892 --> 01:02:13,053
- You did?
- I had some help.

808
01:02:13,095 --> 01:02:15,256
- Like my hat?
- I love your hat.

809
01:02:15,297 --> 01:02:17,697
Look at you.
You're...

810
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:21,066
you're... well,
you're not pale.

811
01:02:21,103 --> 01:02:23,401
What your father means
to say, sweetie,

812
01:02:23,438 --> 01:02:25,133
is that you look beautiful.

813
01:02:25,173 --> 01:02:28,108
- How's Vinny?
- He's pigeon sitting,

814
01:02:28,143 --> 01:02:31,442
which means I'm gonna have
two crazy birds when I get home.

815
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,311
Are you hungry?

816
01:02:33,348 --> 01:02:34,975
Made salad.
I picked it myself.

817
01:02:35,016 --> 01:02:36,916
Sure, let's go.

818
01:02:40,155 --> 01:02:41,782
Hock, I can't
thank you enough.

819
01:02:41,823 --> 01:02:44,087
There's no need.

820
01:02:44,126 --> 01:02:45,923
How's she doing?

821
01:02:45,961 --> 01:02:48,429
Well, she's passable.

822
01:02:48,463 --> 01:02:50,431
How you doing?

823
01:02:50,465 --> 01:02:52,899
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

824
01:02:52,934 --> 01:02:54,663
(ringing triangle)

825
01:02:54,703 --> 01:02:57,729
Come and get it!

826
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:01,707
Well, don't just stand there
like a clubbed catfish,

827
01:03:01,743 --> 01:03:03,540
slap a feedbag on your face.

828
01:03:03,578 --> 01:03:05,739
- All right.
- Come on.

829
01:03:05,781 --> 01:03:07,840
A feedbag on our face.

830
01:03:13,155 --> 01:03:16,522
Mrs. Melton was very pleased
with your finals.

831
01:03:16,558 --> 01:03:18,617
So am I.

832
01:03:21,363 --> 01:03:23,991
Are you still in trouble
at work?

833
01:03:24,032 --> 01:03:25,932
Nah.

834
01:03:25,967 --> 01:03:29,334
But that does remind me
and actually,

835
01:03:29,371 --> 01:03:31,100
since you're talking about it,

836
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:33,266
I have a little project
that would be

837
01:03:33,308 --> 01:03:36,106
a great summer job for you.

838
01:03:36,144 --> 01:03:38,908
I mean, I can't pay you as much
as your grandfather over here, but...

839
01:03:38,947 --> 01:03:40,574
Dad, I have a job here.

840
01:03:40,615 --> 01:03:42,378
I have lots of jobs.

841
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:44,578
I'm in charge of the dishes

842
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:46,678
and the compost
and the saddles...

843
01:03:46,721 --> 01:03:49,451
Don't you wanna
come home?

844
01:03:56,298 --> 01:03:58,289
Hey, we'll talk
about it tomorrow.

845
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:04,562
Lillian, Cody tells me
you know a lot about horses.

846
01:04:06,141 --> 01:04:09,599
Well, did he?
Well, I might be a little rusty,

847
01:04:09,644 --> 01:04:11,771
but yeah.

848
01:04:11,813 --> 01:04:13,872
What do you know
about thoroughbreds?

849
01:04:13,915 --> 01:04:15,815
What do you need to know?

850
01:04:15,851 --> 01:04:17,819
Why don't you meet me
in the morning and walk out

851
01:04:17,853 --> 01:04:19,548
to the stable with me?

852
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:21,215
Be glad to.

853
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:27,625
You know, since this has
turned into some kind of occasion...

854
01:04:29,064 --> 01:04:32,500
why don't we push
breakfast back till 6:00?

855
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:34,832
You watch the fire, Belle.

856
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:36,303
See you all
in the morning.

857
01:04:36,338 --> 01:04:38,329
Good night.

858
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:57,349
Well, Mr. Banyon,
I've seldom seen finer.

859
01:04:57,392 --> 01:05:00,190
I mean, he's worth
every penny they offered and more,

860
01:05:00,228 --> 01:05:03,664
but I can't for the life of me
understand why you'd want to sell him.

861
01:05:03,698 --> 01:05:06,166
Well, did you read the sign
out there on the drive?

862
01:05:06,201 --> 01:05:08,692
- Yeah.
- Banyon Farms.

863
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:11,672
It didn't say
Banyon Petting Zoo.

864
01:05:11,706 --> 01:05:15,472
Well, then you probably know
that the smart business decision

865
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,444
is breeding this stallion.

866
01:05:17,479 --> 01:05:19,743
Why do you think
they wanna buy him?

867
01:05:19,781 --> 01:05:21,874
Lillian's right, Grandpa.

868
01:05:21,917 --> 01:05:24,909
You can keep Apache Wind
and still get your money back.

869
01:05:24,953 --> 01:05:26,944
Just like Atticus' puppies.

870
01:05:26,988 --> 01:05:29,889
Go turn him out, Doc.

871
01:05:29,925 --> 01:05:31,984
What about them pups, Basham?

872
01:05:33,061 --> 01:05:35,222
These two here
are cut real well.

873
01:05:35,263 --> 01:05:38,061
This one's knuckle here
is all wrong.

874
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:40,158
This one's a hip-popper, for sure.

875
01:05:42,304 --> 01:05:45,330
Well, you know
what you gotta do.

876
01:05:45,373 --> 01:05:47,000
Mm-hmm.

877
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:49,636
You can't predict hip dysplasia
in a puppy.

878
01:05:49,678 --> 01:05:51,145
Old Basham can.

879
01:05:51,179 --> 01:05:53,773
That's absurd. No one can.

880
01:05:53,815 --> 01:05:57,649
My dear, I have a lot of respect
for your knowledge of horses,

881
01:05:57,686 --> 01:06:00,678
but there's no man alive
can cull a litter like Basham.

882
01:06:00,722 --> 01:06:02,417
He was raised by dogs.

883
01:06:02,457 --> 01:06:05,392
I don't presume
to tell you your business.

884
01:06:05,427 --> 01:06:07,418
Please don't presume
to tell me mine.

885
01:06:07,462 --> 01:06:09,521
That's enough, Hock.

886
01:06:09,564 --> 01:06:12,761
If they're bred wrong, Cody,
they are bred wrong.

887
01:06:12,801 --> 01:06:15,827
And they gotta be sacrificed
for the sake of the bloodline.

888
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:18,202
No, Grandpa.

889
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,002
Basham.

890
01:06:21,176 --> 01:06:24,168
I'm blood.
What about me?

891
01:06:24,212 --> 01:06:26,806
Am I bred wrong?
Am I a freak?

892
01:06:26,848 --> 01:06:28,509
Are you gonna destroy me too?

893
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:31,986
- Belle, that's enough.
- (growls)

894
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:34,011
LILY: Belle.

895
01:06:36,057 --> 01:06:38,525
Yeah, what about it, Hock?

896
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,585
What about our bloodline?

897
01:06:43,098 --> 01:06:45,862
I'd say it was severed
long before now.

898
01:06:47,268 --> 01:06:48,929
We'll be leaving.

899
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:50,995
You suit yourself.

900
01:06:53,241 --> 01:06:56,369
- CODY: Lillian!
- I'm over here.

901
01:06:59,714 --> 01:07:01,306
Any sign of her?

902
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:04,443
That little gymnast is fast.

903
01:07:04,486 --> 01:07:07,944
I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.
I never should have challenged him.

904
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:10,253
No, it's about time
somebody stood up to him.

905
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:12,486
He's been like this
ever since Andrea died.

906
01:07:12,527 --> 01:07:15,325
It's all about me. He keeps
taking it out on Belle. It's not right.

907
01:07:15,363 --> 01:07:17,331
He blames you?

908
01:07:17,365 --> 01:07:19,697
What's not to blame?

909
01:08:33,308 --> 01:08:35,367
You could have drowned.

910
01:08:37,112 --> 01:08:39,910
Have you decided for me?

911
01:08:39,948 --> 01:08:41,347
What?

912
01:08:41,382 --> 01:08:44,010
Have you decided
my fate, Daddy?

913
01:08:45,453 --> 01:08:48,320
What are you talking about?

914
01:08:48,356 --> 01:08:50,347
Like Hock and that old mare.

915
01:08:50,391 --> 01:08:53,383
Like Basham
and those puppies.

916
01:08:55,497 --> 01:08:58,523
Like Mom.

917
01:09:03,404 --> 01:09:05,372
Belle,

918
01:09:05,406 --> 01:09:07,397
baby, you don't think that...

919
01:09:07,442 --> 01:09:09,433
I don't have to think.

920
01:09:10,745 --> 01:09:13,236
I saw it with my own eyes.

921
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:18,610
I saw it in that hallway.

922
01:09:18,653 --> 01:09:21,053
I saw you
with that doctor.

923
01:09:24,459 --> 01:09:27,895
But you didn't kill her,
did you, Daddy?

924
01:09:30,665 --> 01:09:33,190
You just had her euthanized.

925
01:09:33,234 --> 01:09:35,668
- Belle.
- Hush!

926
01:09:46,481 --> 01:09:48,472
She thinks I killed her mother...

927
01:09:49,984 --> 01:09:52,145
that I pulled some plug.

928
01:09:54,022 --> 01:09:55,546
You don't think that, do you?

929
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:57,649
No.

930
01:09:58,927 --> 01:10:01,794
No, I don't.

931
01:10:03,264 --> 01:10:05,994
You were driving, but...

932
01:10:11,005 --> 01:10:13,371
What? He was.

933
01:10:13,408 --> 01:10:16,241
Was he?

934
01:10:21,349 --> 01:10:24,750
If Belle would have
drowned in that river,

935
01:10:24,786 --> 01:10:27,812
who would you
have blamed for that?

936
01:11:29,717 --> 01:11:32,584
I just got word that
all my stock's been turned loose.

937
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:34,611
Where is your daughter?

938
01:11:56,511 --> 01:11:58,809
Come on, guys.

939
01:11:58,846 --> 01:12:01,713
I don't know
where we're going.

940
01:12:01,749 --> 01:12:04,115
But anyplace
is better than here.

941
01:12:16,798 --> 01:12:19,961
Tobias, take the ATV
down to the river.

942
01:12:20,001 --> 01:12:22,367
- Satch, you take the truck west.
- You got it.

943
01:12:22,403 --> 01:12:25,998
Little Doc, you stay in the barn
and watch for anybody who comes back.

944
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:33,304
(engine turns over)

945
01:12:37,085 --> 01:12:38,780
Yeah, County, that's confirmed.

946
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:41,755
We got a missing
12-year-old Caucasian female,

947
01:12:41,789 --> 01:12:45,020
approximately 4'11", 65 lbs,

948
01:12:45,059 --> 01:12:47,584
shoulder-length brown hair,
brown eyes.

949
01:12:47,628 --> 01:12:49,687
Do you copy?

950
01:12:53,634 --> 01:12:56,660
OFFICER: 1027,
she's not traveling blacktop.

951
01:12:56,704 --> 01:12:59,002
Maybe it's time
to hit the gravel.

952
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,736
(silent)

953
01:13:04,946 --> 01:13:07,881
"I wanted you to see
what real courage is.

954
01:13:07,915 --> 01:13:10,611
It's when you know you're licked
before you begin,

955
01:13:10,651 --> 01:13:12,312
but you begin anyway

956
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:14,412
and you see it through
no matter what.

957
01:13:14,455 --> 01:13:17,913
You rarely win,
but sometimes you do."

958
01:13:17,959 --> 01:13:20,359
Looks like a storm's coming, guys.

959
01:13:20,395 --> 01:13:22,386
We'd better get going.

960
01:13:41,549 --> 01:13:44,177
(thunder crashing)

961
01:13:46,754 --> 01:13:48,745
Where are you, Belle?

962
01:13:55,329 --> 01:13:57,024
All right, listen up.

963
01:13:57,064 --> 01:13:59,760
I know you've scoured every
square inch of this place.

964
01:13:59,801 --> 01:14:02,099
That means we gotta move
the perimeter out

965
01:14:02,136 --> 01:14:04,001
another three miles.

966
01:14:04,038 --> 01:14:06,939
Do that and don't come back
without her.

967
01:14:14,816 --> 01:14:17,910
(train crossing ringing)

968
01:14:17,952 --> 01:14:19,385
(whinnying)

969
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:21,581
Come on, Apache Wind.
We're almost there.

970
01:14:21,622 --> 01:14:23,180
Come on, you're okay.

971
01:14:23,224 --> 01:14:26,022
Come on, let's go.

972
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:29,052
Atticus, help me out.
Come on.

973
01:14:29,096 --> 01:14:31,189
(puppy whimpering)

974
01:14:31,232 --> 01:14:34,497
- (whistle blaring)
- Come on, Apache Wind, come on!

975
01:14:34,535 --> 01:14:36,230
- Settle down. You're okay.
- (whinnies)

976
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:38,170
(screams)

977
01:14:44,245 --> 01:14:47,772
- (whistle blaring)
- (barking)

978
01:15:38,299 --> 01:15:40,563
I thought she was raised
more sensible.

979
01:15:40,601 --> 01:15:41,966
Ho, boy.

980
01:15:42,003 --> 01:15:45,029
More sensible? She's 12.

981
01:15:46,073 --> 01:15:48,200
There are a lot
of hard lessons in life, Hock,

982
01:15:48,242 --> 01:15:51,507
but there's no reason that a kid
should have to learn them all at once,

983
01:15:51,546 --> 01:15:53,639
especially from her grandfather.

984
01:15:53,681 --> 01:15:55,740
Or her father,
for that matter.

985
01:15:55,783 --> 01:15:59,150
She makes perfect sense to me.

986
01:15:59,186 --> 01:16:02,383
All she sees in all
living things is the potential.

987
01:16:03,491 --> 01:16:05,652
My God,

988
01:16:05,693 --> 01:16:08,184
why would anybody want her
to see it any other way?

989
01:16:11,165 --> 01:16:14,828
Well, if she rode north of the draw,

990
01:16:14,869 --> 01:16:17,804
there's nothing between her
and Nebraska but hope.

991
01:16:22,043 --> 01:16:24,068
You take the River Road, Cody.

992
01:16:42,697 --> 01:16:44,995
You fell and hit your head.

993
01:16:45,032 --> 01:16:48,524
Apache Wind...
where is he?

994
01:16:49,804 --> 01:16:52,602
Went home.

995
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,631
Smart horse.

996
01:17:04,018 --> 01:17:06,680
But I saw you throw them
in the river.

997
01:17:06,721 --> 01:17:08,518
Sometimes eyes lie.

998
01:17:11,626 --> 01:17:15,255
Man, if Hock saw this place,

999
01:17:15,296 --> 01:17:17,764
he'd fire you for sure.

1000
01:17:17,798 --> 01:17:20,358
Possible.

1001
01:17:20,401 --> 01:17:22,096
Those are my friends.

1002
01:17:23,704 --> 01:17:26,172
How do you feed them?
How can you afford...

1003
01:17:26,207 --> 01:17:28,607
Those are my friends.

1004
01:17:28,643 --> 01:17:31,077
They need me
to be strong for them.

1005
01:17:35,216 --> 01:17:37,548
I understand that.

1006
01:17:37,585 --> 01:17:40,076
Grandpa wouldn't.

1007
01:17:40,121 --> 01:17:43,147
She was my friend too...

1008
01:17:45,626 --> 01:17:47,560
your mama.

1009
01:17:53,734 --> 01:17:56,225
Ever since I was no bigger
than you are now,

1010
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:58,170
your mom and me...

1011
01:18:07,882 --> 01:18:09,713
Your Grandpa Hock

1012
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:13,242
see your mama
in everything he set his eye on.

1013
01:18:14,388 --> 01:18:16,447
He see her in Apache Wind.

1014
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:18,481
He see her in that dog.

1015
01:18:18,526 --> 01:18:21,324
He see her in you.

1016
01:18:24,365 --> 01:18:26,128
Eats him up
like battery acid.

1017
01:18:26,167 --> 01:18:28,465
He's broken,
just like my friends.

1018
01:18:28,502 --> 01:18:31,198
But he don't have
nobody to feed him

1019
01:18:31,238 --> 01:18:33,399
and keep him warm
and pat him on the head

1020
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:35,432
and say, "You're okay."

1021
01:18:41,382 --> 01:18:45,318
Sometimes we get so soaked up
in our own misery,

1022
01:18:45,352 --> 01:18:48,116
we can't even fathom
the depth of hurting others.

1023
01:19:00,134 --> 01:19:03,103
We'd better be going now,

1024
01:19:03,137 --> 01:19:05,697
far away,

1025
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,469
and you can't stop us.

1026
01:19:07,508 --> 01:19:09,567
I don't have to.

1027
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:14,604
I lit this place up
like Christmas Eve.

1028
01:19:17,218 --> 01:19:19,880
One if by land,

1029
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,547
two if by you.

1030
01:19:37,872 --> 01:19:39,897
Belle, Belle!

1031
01:19:45,146 --> 01:19:47,273
No no, Grandpa!

1032
01:19:47,314 --> 01:19:49,908
I'm not going back.
I'm not letting you have these animals.

1033
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:53,010
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

1034
01:19:53,053 --> 01:19:54,884
Belle Mae Lawler,

1035
01:19:54,922 --> 01:19:57,618
if you ever... ever

1036
01:19:57,658 --> 01:20:01,492
do that again,

1037
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:03,258
I will die.

1038
01:20:13,707 --> 01:20:17,268
All this time I thought
you had a still out here.

1039
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:20,178
No, sir.

1040
01:20:20,214 --> 01:20:22,614
Well, son,

1041
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:24,709
you're gonna wish you had.

1042
01:20:33,227 --> 01:20:35,058
That hurt?

1043
01:20:35,095 --> 01:20:36,790
A little.

1044
01:20:36,831 --> 01:20:38,856
You know, we don't call
hurt "pain" anymore.

1045
01:20:38,899 --> 01:20:40,992
We call it discomfort.

1046
01:20:41,035 --> 01:20:43,799
Then I'm pretty discomfortable.

1047
01:20:43,838 --> 01:20:45,897
You're gonna have
a nasty bump on your head,

1048
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:49,706
but you're gonna be okay.
You got it?

1049
01:20:51,011 --> 01:20:53,980
How's Dad?

1050
01:20:54,014 --> 01:20:56,141
He'll be in in a sec.

1051
01:20:58,619 --> 01:21:00,484
You like him, don't you?

1052
01:21:00,521 --> 01:21:02,148
Of course I do.

1053
01:21:02,189 --> 01:21:04,487
No, you "like" him.

1054
01:21:04,525 --> 01:21:05,822
Don't you?

1055
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:08,385
Of course I do.

1056
01:21:10,297 --> 01:21:12,390
Okay, that does it.

1057
01:21:12,433 --> 01:21:14,401
And you can forget
about any malpractice, missy,

1058
01:21:14,435 --> 01:21:16,426
because I don't even have
a license for people.

1059
01:21:31,585 --> 01:21:34,019
That night at the hospital...

1060
01:21:36,056 --> 01:21:39,116
I did argue
with the doctor.

1061
01:21:41,896 --> 01:21:44,023
I argued with him
because your mother

1062
01:21:44,064 --> 01:21:47,522
was technically...

1063
01:21:47,568 --> 01:21:49,536
clinically she was...

1064
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:51,800
I understand.

1065
01:21:51,839 --> 01:21:54,808
And the doctor said
that the best thing to do

1066
01:21:54,842 --> 01:21:57,208
would be to remove her
from life support

1067
01:21:57,244 --> 01:21:59,508
and let her slip away peacefully.

1068
01:22:00,881 --> 01:22:03,975
And I said no,

1069
01:22:04,018 --> 01:22:06,452
and I said no and no

1070
01:22:06,487 --> 01:22:08,682
and no.
And I kept saying no.

1071
01:22:11,392 --> 01:22:14,259
She lasted another 39 hours.

1072
01:22:20,034 --> 01:22:22,662
Honey, I didn't do

1073
01:22:22,703 --> 01:22:25,331
what you think I did,

1074
01:22:25,372 --> 01:22:29,103
but I wish to God I had.

1075
01:22:29,143 --> 01:22:32,635
I wished when they asked,
I would have just said, "Yes, do it."

1076
01:22:34,014 --> 01:22:35,641
Because for the next 39 hours,

1077
01:22:35,683 --> 01:22:38,151
I don't know
where your mother was.

1078
01:22:38,185 --> 01:22:41,780
I don't know what kind of hell
she was going through.

1079
01:22:46,794 --> 01:22:50,560
And I am ashamed

1080
01:22:50,597 --> 01:22:52,963
of being so selfish.

1081
01:22:56,337 --> 01:23:00,034
There isn't a day that goes by
that I don't regret prolonging it.

1082
01:23:01,809 --> 01:23:05,210
Those 39 hours could
have been an eternity.

1083
01:23:07,815 --> 01:23:10,215
I knew Mom was going
to someplace good

1084
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:13,742
and someplace special
and she deserved to get there sooner.

1085
01:23:34,408 --> 01:23:36,842
What about that summer job?
You ready?

1086
01:23:36,877 --> 01:23:39,812
- Yeah.
- Because I gotta get back to work.

1087
01:23:39,847 --> 01:23:42,782
And Lillian's gotta get back
because the last thing I heard

1088
01:23:42,816 --> 01:23:45,478
was Vinny bit Natasha
in the butt.

1089
01:23:47,321 --> 01:23:50,119
Tomorrow, my little cowgirl,

1090
01:23:50,157 --> 01:23:52,148
we ride.

1091
01:23:57,031 --> 01:23:58,931
- Behave yourself.
- Okay.

1092
01:24:01,268 --> 01:24:03,498
I gotta have my hat.

1093
01:24:13,447 --> 01:24:15,506
See ya.

1094
01:24:22,222 --> 01:24:24,281
Goodbye, Hock.

1095
01:24:24,324 --> 01:24:27,691
Cody, Belle,

1096
01:24:27,728 --> 01:24:29,787
Lillian.

1097
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:32,663
- Bye.
- Goodbye, guys.

1098
01:24:34,701 --> 01:24:36,862
Hey, hold on just a minute.

1099
01:24:36,904 --> 01:24:39,395
Basham,

1100
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,135
cut that mutt loose.

1101
01:24:43,077 --> 01:24:45,068
(snaps fingers)
Get going.

1102
01:24:48,615 --> 01:24:51,345
Daddy, please please please.

1103
01:24:51,385 --> 01:24:53,717
- Please.
- Why not?

1104
01:24:55,589 --> 01:24:57,147
Thank you, Grandpa.

1105
01:24:57,191 --> 01:25:00,524
Don't thank me.
You spoiled him.

1106
01:25:00,561 --> 01:25:04,019
- I what?
- He's spoiled.

1107
01:25:15,175 --> 01:25:17,507
You know what, Grandpa?

1108
01:25:17,544 --> 01:25:20,172
If you call that spoiled,

1109
01:25:20,214 --> 01:25:22,273
then there's a heck
of a lot more spoiling

1110
01:25:22,316 --> 01:25:24,045
that needs to be done around here.

1111
01:25:24,084 --> 01:25:26,678
And if you're too stubborn

1112
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:28,312
and you're
too fuzzle-headed

1113
01:25:28,355 --> 01:25:32,052
and you're too stupid
to realize that,

1114
01:25:32,092 --> 01:25:34,026
then I'm just gonna have
to do it myself.

1115
01:25:34,061 --> 01:25:36,052
There's gonna be
some changes around here.

1116
01:25:38,732 --> 01:25:42,133
Is that okay
with you, Dad?

1117
01:25:42,169 --> 01:25:43,966
Are you asking me?

1118
01:25:44,004 --> 01:25:47,235
For starters,
I don't trust him with my puppy.

1119
01:25:47,274 --> 01:25:49,367
What?

1120
01:25:49,409 --> 01:25:51,036
And...

1121
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:58,414
Grandpa needs someone
to pat him on the head

1122
01:25:58,452 --> 01:26:00,317
and tell him he's okay.

1123
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:05,481
You got it, kid.

1124
01:26:19,673 --> 01:26:22,073
Hey! Hey, just a minute.

1125
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:24,475
There was no talk
about her being permanent.

1126
01:26:25,646 --> 01:26:27,341
Can it, Grandpa.

1127
01:26:27,381 --> 01:26:29,212
When you're done
standing around,

1128
01:26:29,249 --> 01:26:31,080
you can meet me out
by the compost heap.

1129
01:26:31,118 --> 01:26:33,951
Someone's gotta do
some work around here.

1130
01:26:38,659 --> 01:26:41,890
- Belle, be good. Brush your teeth.
- Bye.

1131
01:26:48,902 --> 01:26:50,961
(cell phone rings)

1132
01:26:51,004 --> 01:26:53,097
LILY: Hey, Nat.

1133
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:55,540
What?

1134
01:26:55,576 --> 01:26:57,840
Oh, no.

1135
01:26:57,878 --> 01:26:59,903
We got another one.

1136
01:26:59,947 --> 01:27:02,472
NATASHA: Checked
and rechecked, nada.

1137
01:27:03,784 --> 01:27:05,479
LILY:
Toxicology from K State?

1138
01:27:05,519 --> 01:27:08,010
NATASHA: Not.

1139
01:27:08,055 --> 01:27:11,752
Blood work, stool,

1140
01:27:11,792 --> 01:27:13,919
pathology report
from KSDVM?

1141
01:27:13,961 --> 01:27:16,589
Nein, nyet and no way, dude.

1142
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:19,155
There's nothing here.

1143
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:20,996
There has got to be a link.

1144
01:27:21,034 --> 01:27:23,332
I just know there has
to be some link.

1145
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:24,667
You...

1146
01:27:24,705 --> 01:27:27,196
Me what?

1147
01:27:28,308 --> 01:27:30,902
You! You're the only link.

1148
01:27:30,944 --> 01:27:32,844
You are
the common denominator.

1149
01:27:32,879 --> 01:27:36,042
Your clients, your dogs,
your care and prescribed treatment.

1150
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:37,641
Your meds, diet and...

1151
01:27:37,684 --> 01:27:40,619
Oh my God.
Do you think that's true?

1152
01:27:40,654 --> 01:27:42,884
You are the kiss of death,

1153
01:27:42,923 --> 01:27:45,289
Dr. Lillian Cole.

1154
01:27:47,527 --> 01:27:49,552
I'm kidding.

1155
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:55,561
Don't do that.

1156
01:27:55,602 --> 01:27:58,435
- Mr. Peepers is getting cranky.
- No, stop.

1157
01:28:01,808 --> 01:28:05,471
Well, when is the food
gonna arrive?

1158
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:09,174
Every now and then
you should eat a little something

1159
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:11,411
that won't turn your heart
into a hockey puck.

1160
01:28:22,863 --> 01:28:24,490
Belle,

1161
01:28:24,531 --> 01:28:27,398
what about these changes?

1162
01:28:27,434 --> 01:28:30,494
There's no such thing
as culling a litter anymore.

1163
01:28:31,705 --> 01:28:34,503
If a pup isn't fit to be sold,
we'll just have to find a home for it.

1164
01:28:34,541 --> 01:28:37,908
That's gonna make a lot
of extra mouths to feed.

1165
01:28:37,944 --> 01:28:39,935
I'll pay for it.

1166
01:28:41,214 --> 01:28:43,580
You will?

1167
01:28:43,617 --> 01:28:46,848
You can deduct it
from my raise.

1168
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,558
We'll need special pens
for Basham's critters

1169
01:28:56,596 --> 01:28:59,030
that have access to the pond
and pasture.

1170
01:28:59,066 --> 01:29:00,897
Who's gonna pay for that?

1171
01:29:00,934 --> 01:29:02,902
Basham will.

1172
01:29:02,936 --> 01:29:06,372
You can deduct it
from his raise.

1173
01:29:18,919 --> 01:29:22,150
You know,

1174
01:29:22,189 --> 01:29:24,817
this is all well
and good for a time, honey.

1175
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:29,158
But I seriously can't sustain
the expense

1176
01:29:29,196 --> 01:29:31,426
of husbanding animals

1177
01:29:31,465 --> 01:29:34,593
that don't return a profit.

1178
01:29:34,634 --> 01:29:36,898
And neither can you.

1179
01:29:36,937 --> 01:29:38,996
And neither can Basham.

1180
01:29:41,007 --> 01:29:42,872
There's a reality out there

1181
01:29:42,909 --> 01:29:46,868
that you just have to accept.

1182
01:29:48,148 --> 01:29:50,708
And it's not about the money.

1183
01:29:50,751 --> 01:29:52,981
I know that, Grandpa.

1184
01:29:53,019 --> 01:29:54,680
But for a time,

1185
01:29:54,721 --> 01:29:57,189
until I think of something else?

1186
01:29:59,092 --> 01:30:01,083
Yeah, for a time.

1187
01:30:10,504 --> 01:30:13,735
Now about Apache Wind.

1188
01:30:13,774 --> 01:30:15,503
What about him?

1189
01:30:15,542 --> 01:30:18,534
He's not for sale.

1190
01:30:18,578 --> 01:30:20,273
What we should do is...

1191
01:30:20,313 --> 01:30:22,338
(silent)

1192
01:30:29,222 --> 01:30:32,555
Did you double his stud fees?

1193
01:30:32,592 --> 01:30:34,059
Nope.

1194
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:39,221
I tripled 'em.

1195
01:30:46,807 --> 01:30:49,674
- And...
- Scout.

1196
01:30:55,515 --> 01:30:57,676
- Calpurnia.
- Calpurnia.

1197
01:30:57,717 --> 01:31:00,015
No, this is Miss Maudie.

1198
01:31:00,053 --> 01:31:03,420
Calpurnia has a little white spot
on her left foot.

1199
01:31:05,358 --> 01:31:07,155
Let's start over.

1200
01:31:07,194 --> 01:31:09,424
That horse's name is...

1201
01:31:09,463 --> 01:31:10,987
Olivia.

1202
01:31:13,033 --> 01:31:16,366
Woman I know.

1203
01:31:16,403 --> 01:31:18,564
You knew a woman?
(laughs)

1204
01:31:18,605 --> 01:31:21,369
My mother!

1205
01:31:21,408 --> 01:31:23,342
Well...

1206
01:31:23,376 --> 01:31:26,607
- Olivia.
- Olivia.

1207
01:31:26,646 --> 01:31:29,945
You know, if we could
change that hedge line

1208
01:31:29,983 --> 01:31:32,747
to the berm, we could cut down
on some of that store-bought feed...

1209
01:31:32,786 --> 01:31:36,153
Your mother loved animals.

1210
01:31:37,891 --> 01:31:40,621
She loved animals

1211
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:42,719
more than life itself.

1212
01:31:56,009 --> 01:31:59,536
And with the price of hedge
going for 140 bucks a cord.

1213
01:32:02,082 --> 01:32:04,209
Hey, Lil, you okay?

1214
01:32:05,886 --> 01:32:09,549
- It's aflatoxin.
- Gesundheit.

1215
01:32:09,589 --> 01:32:11,614
No, it's aflatoxin.

1216
01:32:11,658 --> 01:32:14,092
I know what killed those dogs.

1217
01:32:14,127 --> 01:32:16,152
I figured it out.

1218
01:32:19,733 --> 01:32:21,724
We gotta go.

1219
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:26,899
Come on.

1220
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:29,738
I chose those dogs' diets.

1221
01:32:29,776 --> 01:32:32,438
But there's no way
all my stock was tainted.

1222
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:34,947
It would have to be something
occurring to the food.

1223
01:32:34,981 --> 01:32:37,108
Something that occurs
haphazardly

1224
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:39,584
that affects one batch
and not another.

1225
01:32:39,619 --> 01:32:43,180
Hence, the reason it was
so difficult to trace and isolate.

1226
01:32:43,223 --> 01:32:45,214
- CODY: Aflatoxin?
- Mm-hmm.

1227
01:32:59,739 --> 01:33:02,299
No no, it's not your food, sir.

1228
01:33:02,342 --> 01:33:05,675
Aflatoxin is a mold that's inherent
to all grain-based feeds.

1229
01:33:05,712 --> 01:33:07,077
I know all about aflatoxin,

1230
01:33:07,113 --> 01:33:09,513
but it can't survive the heat
of our extrusion process.

1231
01:33:09,549 --> 01:33:13,417
If that process is less than 10%
moisture in the final product, correct?

1232
01:33:13,453 --> 01:33:16,388
- Well, yes.
- Even 1% above that, and you have...

1233
01:33:16,423 --> 01:33:18,948
- Food poisoning.
- Exactly.

1234
01:33:18,992 --> 01:33:21,586
So what you're saying is if one
of my temperature gauges is off

1235
01:33:21,628 --> 01:33:23,596
- by even just a little bit...
- Yes yes.

1236
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:25,188
But it can't be all that much off.

1237
01:33:25,231 --> 01:33:27,722
The incidents, the deaths
were fairly localized,

1238
01:33:27,767 --> 01:33:30,565
and if you have
even 1% more...

1239
01:33:30,604 --> 01:33:32,834
Get me security.

1240
01:33:32,872 --> 01:33:36,364
Drop the gates.

1241
01:33:36,409 --> 01:33:39,742
Stop the run.
That's right.

1242
01:33:39,779 --> 01:33:42,179
Yeah, the entire run.

1243
01:33:49,756 --> 01:33:52,156
(barking)

1244
01:33:52,192 --> 01:33:53,887
Atticus, shh!

1245
01:33:53,927 --> 01:33:56,191
- Shh, no!
- Easy now, boy.

1246
01:33:56,229 --> 01:34:00,063
Atticus, stop, no!
Atticus, stop!

1247
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:01,761
Easy now.

1248
01:34:01,801 --> 01:34:05,100
Atticus, no!

1249
01:34:05,138 --> 01:34:07,072
- Stop, Atticus!
- I said heel!

1250
01:34:07,107 --> 01:34:09,974
Atticus, no!
(screams)

1251
01:34:10,010 --> 01:34:12,979
My understanding is that the attack
was totally unprovoked.

1252
01:34:14,414 --> 01:34:17,542
Yeah, it was.

1253
01:34:17,584 --> 01:34:20,485
It's her dog?

1254
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:23,546
It's her...

1255
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:25,421
it's our dog.

1256
01:34:25,458 --> 01:34:29,087
Hock, this has gotta go
a certain way.

1257
01:34:30,296 --> 01:34:32,264
Yeah.

1258
01:34:36,569 --> 01:34:38,560
Give me a minute.

1259
01:34:44,344 --> 01:34:46,574
Hey, Belle.

1260
01:34:46,613 --> 01:34:50,413
We got a decision to make.

1261
01:34:50,450 --> 01:34:52,213
I know.

1262
01:34:52,252 --> 01:34:55,050
What's gonna happen now

1263
01:34:55,088 --> 01:34:58,080
is Brent's gonna take
the dog down

1264
01:34:58,124 --> 01:35:01,252
to the pound
and it's gotta stay there

1265
01:35:01,294 --> 01:35:04,161
until the judge
makes a determination.

1266
01:35:06,232 --> 01:35:07,665
But from what he tells me,

1267
01:35:07,701 --> 01:35:10,568
it's pretty much
a foregone conclusion.

1268
01:35:12,439 --> 01:35:15,101
We're gonna have
to put him down.

1269
01:35:17,077 --> 01:35:20,069
BELLE: How long will he
have to stay at the pound?

1270
01:35:20,113 --> 01:35:23,082
Days. Maybe weeks.

1271
01:35:26,252 --> 01:35:29,813
What if no one
presses charges?

1272
01:35:29,856 --> 01:35:32,791
Well, it doesn't work
like that, honey.

1273
01:35:32,826 --> 01:35:36,762
It's out of our hands unless...

1274
01:35:36,796 --> 01:35:40,027
Unless what?

1275
01:35:40,066 --> 01:35:42,626
Unless we take care
of things ourselves

1276
01:35:42,669 --> 01:35:46,127
and we just keep it
in the family.

1277
01:35:47,273 --> 01:35:49,571
Honey, why don't you let me
make this decision?

1278
01:35:49,609 --> 01:35:52,601
No, Grandpa,
this is my decision.

1279
01:35:59,486 --> 01:36:02,250
No pound.

1280
01:36:02,288 --> 01:36:04,779
For Atticus,
that could be an eternity.

1281
01:36:06,926 --> 01:36:08,985
Okay.

1282
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:16,930
So if you leave the dog here,

1283
01:36:16,970 --> 01:36:19,336
we'll put it down.

1284
01:36:19,372 --> 01:36:20,930
That'd be fine.

1285
01:36:20,974 --> 01:36:24,603
Just no later than tomorrow.

1286
01:36:24,644 --> 01:36:27,636
- Okay, appreciate that. Thank you.
- Yeah.

1287
01:36:42,362 --> 01:36:46,321
Natasha tries to get me
out here once a week.

1288
01:36:46,366 --> 01:36:48,334
And do you go?

1289
01:36:48,368 --> 01:36:49,995
Not till now.

1290
01:36:50,036 --> 01:36:52,869
Why not?

1291
01:36:52,906 --> 01:36:54,498
I don't know.

1292
01:36:54,541 --> 01:36:56,031
I guess it just reminds me

1293
01:36:56,075 --> 01:36:58,737
of all the things I'm not,

1294
01:36:58,778 --> 01:37:01,212
all the things I'm missing,

1295
01:37:01,247 --> 01:37:04,307
all those bright, pretty things.

1296
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:11,079
There is not a light in this city
that shines brighter than you.

1297
01:37:14,928 --> 01:37:17,726
Wow, I never pegged you
for a romantic.

1298
01:37:17,764 --> 01:37:20,733
I have my moments.

1299
01:37:20,767 --> 01:37:23,292
They're few and far between,
but I have my moments.

1300
01:37:35,448 --> 01:37:38,212
So...

1301
01:37:38,251 --> 01:37:40,219
we have a good night?

1302
01:37:40,253 --> 01:37:43,484
No, we had a great night.

1303
01:37:44,524 --> 01:37:48,255
A little dinner, a little music,

1304
01:37:48,294 --> 01:37:51,388
a little dancing,

1305
01:37:51,431 --> 01:37:53,228
a little...

1306
01:37:53,266 --> 01:37:55,234
- (cell phone ringing)
- I'm sorry.

1307
01:37:55,268 --> 01:37:57,259
It's okay.

1308
01:37:59,639 --> 01:38:02,836
Hello.

1309
01:38:02,876 --> 01:38:04,844
Hock.

1310
01:38:04,878 --> 01:38:07,278
(knock on door)

1311
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:39,305
"When he was nearly 13,

1312
01:38:39,345 --> 01:38:42,246
my brother Jem got
his arm badly broken

1313
01:38:42,282 --> 01:38:43,874
at the elbow.

1314
01:38:43,917 --> 01:38:46,147
When it healed
and Jem's fears

1315
01:38:46,185 --> 01:38:49,518
of never being able to play
football were assuaged...

1316
01:38:51,824 --> 01:38:53,883
Maycomb was an old town,

1317
01:38:53,927 --> 01:38:55,758
but it was a tired old town

1318
01:38:55,795 --> 01:38:57,558
when I first knew it.

1319
01:38:57,597 --> 01:38:59,724
Somehow, it was hotter then:

1320
01:38:59,766 --> 01:39:03,167
A black dog suffered
on a summer's day.

1321
01:39:03,202 --> 01:39:06,069
Bony mules hitched
to Hoover carts

1322
01:39:06,105 --> 01:39:09,165
flicked flies in the sweltering shade
of the live oaks

1323
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:10,505
on the square...

1324
01:39:10,543 --> 01:39:14,377
There are clearly no defined seasons
in South Alabama.

1325
01:39:14,414 --> 01:39:17,747
Summer drifts into autumn,

1326
01:39:17,784 --> 01:39:21,049
and autumn is sometimes
never followed by winter...

1327
01:39:22,789 --> 01:39:25,485
Reverend Sykes's voice
was as distant

1328
01:39:25,525 --> 01:39:27,891
as Judge Taylor's,

1329
01:39:27,927 --> 01:39:31,363
'Miss Jean Louise, stand up.

1330
01:39:31,397 --> 01:39:33,388
Your father's passing...'

1331
01:39:35,401 --> 01:39:37,869
Jem said he would take me.

1332
01:39:37,904 --> 01:39:41,271
Thus began our
longest journey together...

1333
01:39:45,945 --> 01:39:48,038
He turned out the light

1334
01:39:48,081 --> 01:39:52,040
and went into Jem's room.

1335
01:39:52,085 --> 01:39:54,952
He would be there all night.

1336
01:39:54,988 --> 01:39:56,819
He would be there

1337
01:39:56,856 --> 01:39:59,620
when Jem waked up
in the morning."

1338
01:40:23,349 --> 01:40:26,546
How this works is the first shot

1339
01:40:26,586 --> 01:40:27,883
will put him fast to sleep.

1340
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,751
And the second shot

1341
01:40:29,789 --> 01:40:32,155
will stop his heart.

1342
01:40:32,191 --> 01:40:34,989
And then he'll be gone.

1343
01:40:36,929 --> 01:40:38,760
I understand.

1344
01:40:38,798 --> 01:40:41,767
He won't feel any pain,
not even the shot.

1345
01:40:41,801 --> 01:40:44,599
I understand.

1346
01:40:45,838 --> 01:40:48,864
This might not be
the right time,

1347
01:40:48,908 --> 01:40:51,274
but I could not
be more proud of you.

1348
01:40:59,185 --> 01:41:01,710
Ready?

1349
01:41:01,754 --> 01:41:04,222
Yeah.
After the second shot,

1350
01:41:04,257 --> 01:41:06,418
I'd like to be alone with him.

1351
01:41:08,461 --> 01:41:10,452
I think he'd like that.

1352
01:41:12,698 --> 01:41:14,757
Oh, I don't think
that you should...

1353
01:41:16,469 --> 01:41:18,767
(sobbing)

1354
01:41:30,450 --> 01:41:32,441
Okay.

1355
01:41:44,430 --> 01:41:46,295
I didn't ask for this!

1356
01:41:46,332 --> 01:41:48,994
I don't want this!
This ain't right.

1357
01:41:49,035 --> 01:41:51,697
It ain't up to you, Basham.
Now get out.

1358
01:41:51,737 --> 01:41:53,466
Don't make it worse than it is.

1359
01:41:53,506 --> 01:41:55,974
Ain't but a scratch.

1360
01:41:56,008 --> 01:41:58,238
Stand aside, Belle.

1361
01:41:58,277 --> 01:42:00,575
Basham!

1362
01:42:04,784 --> 01:42:07,150
Clayton...

1363
01:42:09,755 --> 01:42:12,155
I need you to be strong
for me now.

1364
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:24,062
No 4H Club.

1365
01:42:24,103 --> 01:42:26,094
Oh no, Belle.

1366
01:42:27,807 --> 01:42:29,798
No way.

1367
01:42:31,110 --> 01:42:32,600
Well...

1368
01:42:34,113 --> 01:42:35,876
Hold on.

1369
01:42:38,651 --> 01:42:41,381
Was that the feed
that you were

1370
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:44,253
feeding Apache Wind
whenever Atticus attacked you?

1371
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:45,985
BASHAM: It was.

1372
01:42:50,496 --> 01:42:53,226
That's CW feed.

1373
01:42:54,734 --> 01:42:57,225
(sniffs)

1374
01:43:00,606 --> 01:43:03,336
- A dog knows.
- Don't he?

1375
01:43:03,376 --> 01:43:05,776
Belle, honey.

1376
01:43:05,811 --> 01:43:07,540
What in the Sam Hill
is going on?

1377
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:10,105
There's a... it's a grain-based
mold that's coming

1378
01:43:10,149 --> 01:43:11,776
in this brand of feed right now.

1379
01:43:11,817 --> 01:43:14,547
They're looking into it.
But it's called alpha...

1380
01:43:14,587 --> 01:43:18,523
aflatoxin or something like that.

1381
01:43:18,558 --> 01:43:22,255
Look, you ever heard of a little
thing called canine precognition?

1382
01:43:24,163 --> 01:43:26,393
You know, I picked out
that dog myself.

1383
01:43:26,432 --> 01:43:29,526
- Yeah yeah.
- Of course you did.

1384
01:43:29,569 --> 01:43:32,595
BELLE: Lillian, Lillian,
he's waking up!

1385
01:43:32,638 --> 01:43:34,230
Coming.

1386
01:43:36,609 --> 01:43:39,100
That's quite a girl
you got there.

1387
01:43:39,145 --> 01:43:41,136
Which one?

1388
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:43,375
(laughs)

1389
01:43:48,821 --> 01:43:51,119
You were driving
that car, son.

1390
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:55,951
Does it matter?

1391
01:43:57,296 --> 01:44:00,697
It does not.

1392
01:44:00,733 --> 01:44:03,930
But you know, your daughter
has got animals crammed

1393
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:06,564
into every God-splashed
inch of this place.

1394
01:44:06,606 --> 01:44:09,905
I could probably help you out
with that actually.

1395
01:44:09,942 --> 01:44:13,343
- Is that a fact?
- That is a fact.

1396
01:44:13,379 --> 01:44:15,813
For a little price.

1397
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:19,648
I'll talk to you about it.
Come on.

1398
01:44:20,987 --> 01:44:22,716
- Two coats.
- It doesn't need two coats.

1399
01:44:22,755 --> 01:44:24,052
Cody said two coats.

1400
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:25,751
You're not even getting
one coat on that one.

1401
01:44:25,791 --> 01:44:27,918
You start farther up
and I got this.

1402
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:29,450
Okay.

1403
01:44:55,821 --> 01:44:57,914
Cheeseburger...
hold the cheese.

1404
01:44:57,957 --> 01:45:00,425
See ya.

1405
01:45:03,296 --> 01:45:07,255
I've had worse
motel guests than this. Trust me.

1406
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:11,236
39 Shriners came
through here one Halloween night.

1407
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:14,501
Boy, howdy!

1408
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:16,531
Oh! (laughing)

1409
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:24,277
Oh, yeah!
That's gonna buy a lot of kibble.

1410
01:45:24,317 --> 01:45:26,308
Thank you, guys, so much.

1411
01:45:29,255 --> 01:45:31,917
- How old is he?
- He's 5 years old.

1412
01:45:31,957 --> 01:45:34,687
- Any problems with him before?
- No...

1413
01:45:34,727 --> 01:45:36,854
- Hock, good to see you again.
- Jim.

1414
01:45:36,896 --> 01:45:39,330
Rick, my friend Poovey.

1415
01:45:39,365 --> 01:45:42,857
- Mr. Poovey.
- How do you do? Howdy. Howdy.

1416
01:45:42,902 --> 01:45:44,870
- Did you bring that check?
- I sure did.

1417
01:45:44,904 --> 01:45:46,804
I just need to know
who to make it out to.

1418
01:45:46,839 --> 01:45:48,966
You make it out
to those people right there.

1419
01:45:50,409 --> 01:45:53,071
I'm just gonna check
that all the zeroes are in place.

1420
01:45:53,112 --> 01:45:55,842
They're there,
I think you'll find.

1421
01:45:55,881 --> 01:45:57,678
They certainly are.

1422
01:45:57,717 --> 01:46:00,049
- It's a pleasure.
- Pleasure's all mine.

1423
01:46:00,086 --> 01:46:01,576
Rick.

1424
01:46:03,022 --> 01:46:06,082
Belle, that's for you, baby.

1425
01:46:13,466 --> 01:46:15,457
Thank you.

1426
01:46:17,903 --> 01:46:19,803
Yeah!

1427
01:46:39,458 --> 01:46:41,824
Hey, cowgirl.

1428
01:46:41,861 --> 01:46:43,761
- I need another book.
- Why?

1429
01:46:43,796 --> 01:46:46,629
I'm completely out of names.

1430
01:46:46,665 --> 01:46:49,566
Well, it looks like you're
gonna need a lot of books.

1431
01:46:49,602 --> 01:46:51,035
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1432
01:46:51,070 --> 01:46:53,095
Let's go.

1433
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:56,001
Bye, Belle.

1434
01:47:15,594 --> 01:47:18,563
You know, I was thinking...

1435
01:47:18,597 --> 01:47:20,531
maybe after I get my whole,
you know,

1436
01:47:20,566 --> 01:47:23,057
Belle situation sorted out,

1437
01:47:23,102 --> 01:47:25,161
maybe you and I could,

1438
01:47:25,204 --> 01:47:28,139
I don't know,
go to the park

1439
01:47:28,174 --> 01:47:31,268
or get some ice cream,

1440
01:47:31,310 --> 01:47:34,973
I don't know, maybe spend
the rest of our life together.

1441
01:47:35,014 --> 01:47:36,641
Really?

1442
01:47:39,785 --> 01:47:42,720
(Vincent squawks)

1443
01:47:48,994 --> 01:47:51,189
CODY: Oh, wow.

1444
01:47:54,667 --> 01:47:57,295
Yeah, see,
now that's about as contrary

1445
01:47:57,336 --> 01:47:59,327
as a bird can get.

1446
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:03,838
- We're gonna have to change his... her...
- No way.

1447
01:48:03,876 --> 01:48:06,436
her name now.
To what?

1448
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:09,744
- To Valerie.
- Victoria.

1449
01:48:09,782 --> 01:48:11,750
- Vanessa.
- Vivica.

1450
01:48:11,784 --> 01:48:14,184
- No, Vanessa.
- What?

1451
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:16,688
Still be Vinny.

1452
01:48:16,722 --> 01:48:18,952
- That's true.
- It'll still be Vinny.

1453
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,695
(rock music playing)

1454
01:48:47,152 --> 01:48:50,883
# There's gonna be some
changes 'round this place #

1455
01:48:50,923 --> 01:48:52,720
# Starting with these socks #

1456
01:48:52,758 --> 01:48:54,817
# But blue corduroys
don't wrinkle #

1457
01:48:54,860 --> 01:48:57,954
# So why should
they come off? #

1458
01:48:57,997 --> 01:49:00,056
# And I'm turning over leaves #

1459
01:49:00,099 --> 01:49:03,125
# And I am turning
on a dime #

1460
01:49:03,168 --> 01:49:07,070
# Living on small change
and borrowed time #

1461
01:49:07,106 --> 01:49:11,008
# But there's gonna be
some changes 'round this place #

1462
01:49:11,043 --> 01:49:13,068
# I thought I'd like to know #

1463
01:49:13,112 --> 01:49:15,307
# The future's bright as Christmas #

1464
01:49:15,347 --> 01:49:17,975
# But it's just as slow #

1465
01:49:18,017 --> 01:49:20,281
# I keep singing
for my supper #

1466
01:49:20,319 --> 01:49:23,049
# And I bow my head
before I eat #

1467
01:49:23,088 --> 01:49:25,682
# I'm praying for another voice #

1468
01:49:25,724 --> 01:49:29,125
# When I sing myself to sleep #

1469
01:49:32,698 --> 01:49:36,225
# Gonna be some changes #

1470
01:49:45,778 --> 01:49:48,303
# I'm burning up
the sheets #

1471
01:49:48,347 --> 01:49:50,815
# All by my lonesome self #

1472
01:49:50,849 --> 01:49:53,579
# And I'm tossing
and I'm tossing #

1473
01:49:53,619 --> 01:49:55,018
# And I'm tossing #

1474
01:49:55,054 --> 01:49:58,683
# And I guess
I'm sleeping fine, man #

1475
01:49:58,724 --> 01:50:00,851
# I still don't dream #

1476
01:50:00,893 --> 01:50:02,053
# Mostly wake up #

1477
01:50:02,094 --> 01:50:05,257
# To a blue TV screen #

1478
01:50:05,297 --> 01:50:08,789
# There's gonna be
some changes 'round this place #

1479
01:50:08,834 --> 01:50:11,064
# I thought I'd like
to know #

1480
01:50:11,103 --> 01:50:13,230
# The future's bright
as Christmas #

1481
01:50:13,272 --> 01:50:15,536
# But it's just as slow #

1482
01:50:15,574 --> 01:50:18,304
# I keep singing
for my supper #

1483
01:50:18,344 --> 01:50:21,279
# And I bow my head
before I eat #

1484
01:50:21,313 --> 01:50:23,747
# I'm praying
for a woman's voice #

1485
01:50:23,782 --> 01:50:27,115
# When I sing myself
to sleep #

1486
01:50:30,756 --> 01:50:33,350
# I heard rumors
of a fork up #

1487
01:50:33,392 --> 01:50:35,860
# In the road #

1488
01:50:35,894 --> 01:50:39,386
# Always waiting
somewhere near #

1489
01:50:40,966 --> 01:50:44,925
# Like the heat lines
snaking across the highway #

1490
01:50:44,970 --> 01:50:47,461
# Leaves you
wishing they were slower #

1491
01:50:47,506 --> 01:50:50,100
# Or it was just a little colder #

1492
01:50:50,142 --> 01:50:52,542
# If I had a faster motor #

1493
01:50:52,578 --> 01:50:56,571
# Could I catch 'em
before they disappear? #

1494
01:50:59,418 --> 01:51:03,377
# There's gonna be
some changes 'round this place #

1495
01:51:03,422 --> 01:51:05,390
# I thought I'd like
to know #

1496
01:51:05,424 --> 01:51:07,824
# The future's right as rain #

1497
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:10,590
# When it's dry
as a bone #

1498
01:51:10,629 --> 01:51:12,654
# I keep singing
for my supper #

1499
01:51:12,698 --> 01:51:15,531
# And I bow my head
before I eat #

1500
01:51:15,567 --> 01:51:17,558
# I'm praying for a chorus #

1501
01:51:17,603 --> 01:51:21,505
# When I sing myself
to sleep #

1502
01:51:27,312 --> 01:51:30,179

some changes #

1503

be some changing #
