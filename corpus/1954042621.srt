1
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:02,999
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:05,631
The one and only,
The emperor of comedy...

3
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:10,599
Sir Eddie Griffin

4
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:55,393
I want to fuck Michelle Obama.

5
00:00:57,298 --> 00:01:01,698
I need her on my team.
I'm waiting on Obama to fuck up.

6
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:05,899
That nigga slip up,
I'ma slide right in.

7
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,233
What's happening, Michelle?
You like comedy?

8
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:18,397
That's some fine chocolate
motherfucker.

9
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:22,632
You understand me?
I didn't vote for Obama because of him,

10
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:30,996
I voted because of her.

11
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:36,057
This is the first first lady
that is fuckable.

12
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:41,084
'Cause you didn't want
To fuck daddy Bush's wife.

13
00:01:45,597 --> 00:01:49,496
She look like she jumped off
the dollar bill.

14
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:52,799
Look at that!
That's George Washington!

15
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:00,498
And you didn't want
to fuck George Jr. 's wife.

16
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:03,464
She look like the mama
on Damien: Omen.

17
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,396
Every time I see her face,
all I hear is...

18
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:13,894
Look like the bitch head about
to spin around at any moment.

19
00:02:13,973 --> 00:02:17,365
And I don't think you wanted
to fuck hillary either.

20
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,692
I don't think Hillary
like dick.

21
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:25,329
She wear more pantsuits than
a brother at a funeral.

22
00:02:27,396 --> 00:02:32,096
Now here's how I know Obama
got some pimp in him.

23
00:02:32,562 --> 00:02:33,162
All right?

24
00:02:33,197 --> 00:02:37,444
Remember when Hillary was running against
him? She talking all that shit about obama.

25
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:42,509
Obama got the job.
He gave her a job.

26
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:47,364
That's pimpin'.

27
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:50,399
And what was the job
he gave her?

28
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:52,364
Secretary of state.

29
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:54,598
And what was the secretary
of state's job?

30
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,164
Stay out of the country.

31
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,699
He banished that bitch
to foreign lands.

32
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,990
And the happiest motherfucker
about it is Bill Clinton.

33
00:03:18,193 --> 00:03:22,493
You know Bill at home,
"Thank you, Obama.

34
00:03:22,528 --> 00:03:26,794
I can get my dick sucked
every day. "

35
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:36,755
Now I knew Obama...
I knew he had some nigga in him....

36
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,758
You know, 'cause at first,
you couldn't tell.

37
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:43,293
But one day,
it jumped out of him.

38
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,598
Y'all remember that day him and George Bush
was walking outside the White House

39
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:54,829
...and his swag was on 250?

40
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,158
I'm sitting at home.
I said, "that brother's a pimp. "

41
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:07,894
You could damn near hear the conversation.
"Hurry up and get your shit out my house.

42
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:14,894
"Take your punk ass back
to texas. You bitch!"

43
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:25,394
'Cause at first, I thought Obama
was an African-American.

44
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:28,493
And white people, I know y'all think
all black people the same.

45
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:34,057
We just like you white folks.
You got different kind of white folks.

46
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:37,492
You got honkies, you got crackers,
you got rednecks, you got white guys.

47
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:45,927
Black people the same way.
You got black folks.

48
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:48,228
"Just don't want
to be bothered. "

49
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:53,427
You got old negroes.
"I sure wish slavery'd come back.

50
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:58,334
Massa was so good to us. "

51
00:04:58,435 --> 00:05:02,829
And you got african-americans.
"I graduated from college Cum da-lada. "

52
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:14,593
And then you have niggas.
Which I happen to be a member of.

53
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:42,094
BULLSHIT!

54
00:05:51,628 --> 00:05:54,558
Translation: NIGGER!

55
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:04,892
"Pull over... "
NIGGER!

56
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:09,028
And obama, here's how I really
knew he had hood in him.

57
00:06:09,063 --> 00:06:12,329
He threw a barbeque...

58
00:06:12,364 --> 00:06:14,493
at the White House...

59
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:21,028
He invited the NBA, the NFL, every rapper.
I think I was the only nigga that wasn't there.

60
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:25,999
You know white people was sitting
at home, "My god! It's all over!
The niggers are barbecuing!

61
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:29,881
They're licking their fingers!

62
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:33,693
They got collard greens
and black-eyed peas. "

63
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:37,129
Here's how I really knew
He was from the hood.

64
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,794
He put a swing set...

65
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:45,228
I don't think y'all heard me.
He put a swing set

66
00:06:45,263 --> 00:06:49,692
on the white house lawn.
That's some nigga shit!

67
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:57,228
He got enough money and power to send
his daughters to Disneyland every day.

68
00:06:57,263 --> 00:07:00,528
He said, "Fuck that. Put that swing set
outside that window

69
00:07:00,563 --> 00:07:03,794
So I can keep my eye
on they little ass. "

70
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:06,228
'Cause black people,
we watch our kids.

71
00:07:06,263 --> 00:07:09,993
I'm talking to you,
white folks.

72
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:13,829
I'm tired of seeing y'all kids
on my milk carton.

73
00:07:13,864 --> 00:07:16,794
You know, you just trying to pour
some milk on your cereal

74
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:22,428
And there's always that little white
face with he caption underneath it.
"Have you seen me?"

75
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:28,028
No, I ain't seen your little ass!
And how come your parents
don't know where the hell you at?

76
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:31,728
You ain't never seen little brothers
and sisters on a milk carton,

77
00:07:31,763 --> 00:07:34,192
'cause if you did,
they'd be posing.

78
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,827
'Cause I remember when we was coming up-
And black people, back me up on this.

79
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:29,927
When we was coming up,
remember your parents tell you,
"You can play to the end of this block. "

80
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:34,526
Remember? That's as far as your ass go.
Ain't no going out to the woods.

81
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:42,729
And I remember my mama told me,
"If you go any further, I'ma fuck you up. "

82
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:48,594
I remember one day, me and my
partner Don Junior, we kicking it, right?

83
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:51,426
We get up to the corner.
Boom, boom.

84
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:54,627
They like, "Ed, come on.
Let's go on the next block.

85
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:58,759
Let's see what's over there. "

86
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,892
Boy, I was nervous.

87
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:10,927
That's when you look down to see
if your mama on the front porch.

88
00:09:10,962 --> 00:09:13,826
My mama looking me
dead in the eye.

89
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:24,027
I couldn't hear her,
but her mouth said...

90
00:09:27,462 --> 00:09:32,028
My uncle Bucky had his pistol. He's like,
"I can shoot your ass from here. "

91
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:34,590
I'm like "Uh, you know, uh"-...

92
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:39,427
They like, "You ain't going, Ed?" I'm like,
"Nah, man. You know, I caught a charlie horse."

93
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:42,793
You know, 'cause I ain't trying
to look like no punk, man.
"I got a horse, you know?"

94
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:46,426
They like, "Aww, you a bitch-ass nigga. "
I said, "I'll be the bitch today.

95
00:09:47,725 --> 00:09:51,925
I'd rather fight both of y'all than take
one ass-whooping from her.

96
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,992
See ya!"

97
00:09:56,427 --> 00:10:00,428
My mama beat me out of
the penitentiary.

98
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:02,826
As y'all can see,
I's free

99
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:11,128
And obviously, y'all parents whooped y'all
out the penitentiary, 'cause y'all here.

100
00:10:11,163 --> 00:10:14,993
We's free!

101
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:19,527
Them two brothers I'm talking about
locked up right now.

102
00:10:19,562 --> 00:10:23,992
'Cause pain give you a memory
of what not to do.

103
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:26,826
You understand me, your partner be like
"Come on, Ed, let's rob this liquor store. "

104
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:32,027
"I ain't going.
I'm cool right here. "

105
00:10:54,462 --> 00:10:58,992
Now they got this
brother, Eddie Long.

106
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:03,427
Oh, don't "ooh" me. I didn't make
the shit up. Y'all seen the story.

107
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:06,994
And, you know, at first, I had to give
the brother the benefit of the doubt.

108
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:10,428
You know what I mean?
I'm like, "No. Black preachers don't
fuck little boys. "

109
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:13,694
That's the difference between a white
church and a black church.

110
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:15,877
White churches fuck your son.

111
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:18,625
Black church fuck your wife.

112
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:15,527
God gave that motherfucking
preacher the right last name. LONG.

113
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:29,427
And he tried to defend himself.
He spoke for about 35 minutes.

114
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:33,892
Not once did he say,
"I didn't do it."

115
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:39,677
All he said is, "I got five rocks
and I ain't thrown one yet. "

116
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:45,427
I said, "that's the gayest
shit I ever heard in my life. "

117
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:50,090
He didn't say, "I got five bullets.
I'm about to bust a cap. "

118
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:56,528
That guy: "I got five rocks,
and I ain't thrown one yet. "

119
00:12:56,563 --> 00:12:59,628
And did you see how
he threw the mic down?

120
00:13:25,427 --> 00:13:27,392
I don't go to church.

121
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:30,528
God don't live in church.
They say the body is the temple.

122
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:33,692
I'm walking to church right now.

123
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:41,028
Soon as you go to church, there's
somebody trying to stick a dick in you,
and they need some money.

124
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:50,177
Every war in humanity's
History has been over some kind of
motherfucking religion.

125
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,927
You know what I mean?
I don't get caught up in that bullshit

126
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:55,728
'cause I don't think God ever
wrote a Bible or a Qur'an.

127
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:58,477
He didn't have to write
no shit. He ain't no playwright.

128
00:13:58,512 --> 00:14:02,791
It's written in your essence,
'cause the Bible was written by men.

129
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:06,490
The book of Peter. The book of John.
The whole book about Jesus,

130
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:09,728
but that nigga
ain't wrote one book.

131
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:13,791
The motherfucker that it's
about didn't write shit.

132
00:14:13,826 --> 00:14:19,126
All the hang-outs wrote a book.
"Shit, I know the nigga, nigga. "

133
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:23,525
And you notice in each one of 'em
book, they the closest one to Jesus.

134
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,425
Peter like, "Me and Jesus was tight."
In John's book, "Shit, I was damn near
the nigga's daddy. You know. "

135
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:37,278
God didn't write no book.
It's written in your essence.

136
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:41,428
Nobody ever had to tell you
it's wrong to kill your mama.

137
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:44,392
Somehow you born innately
knowing that.

138
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:49,125
Which means you born knowing
right and wrong, so put the book down,
'cause it will fuck you up.

139
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,625
It starts out messed up
in the beginning.

140
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,291
In the book of genesis, "In the beginning,
there was Adam and Eve,

141
00:14:58,326 --> 00:15:00,927
and Adam and Eve had two sons,
Cain and Abel.

142
00:15:00,962 --> 00:15:03,125
And Cain and Abel
got married. "

143
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,090
To who?!

144
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,725
Where did these mystery bitches
come from?!

145
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:16,527
I like messing with Christians,
man.

146
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:20,244
'Cause they easy to get...

147
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:26,927
I don't believe Jesus died
on the cross.

148
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:29,992
Sacrilege!

149
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:34,527
Wait a minute, he could walk on water,
feed 1,000 with a loaf of bread...

150
00:15:34,562 --> 00:15:35,892
raised the dead...

151
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:41,826
But you telling me he couldn't
handle three nails?

152
00:15:41,861 --> 00:15:46,326
I know brothers with nine bullet
wounds still walking around.

153
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:49,992
His name is 50 CENT!

154
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:58,690
I bet you Jesus was
a cool kid....

155
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:03,527
His mama be like, "Now, Jesus,
go on in there and take a bath

156
00:16:03,728 --> 00:16:05,828
and don't be walkin'
on your water. "

157
00:16:06,562 --> 00:16:09,892
He in there...

158
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:14,127
That's probably why
they invented the shower,

159
00:16:14,128 --> 00:16:15,528
just to get the nigga wet.

160
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:34,090
Look at some of the Christian
heads in here. "You going to Hell.

161
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,625
"Don't be talking 'bout Jesus,
Eddie. Don't be talking 'bout him. "

162
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,493
You know how Jesus whistle?

163
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:42,326
You know, with the hole
in the hand.

164
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:50,725
Look, y'all really like, "Nigga, that's it.
The lightning's coming. "

165
00:16:56,326 --> 00:16:58,826
Christians always the first one to
want to send somebody to Hell.

166
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:02,091
"You going to Hell. "
How the fuck you know?

167
00:17:02,425 --> 00:17:06,028
Like God came down. "Uh, let that
nigga know he going to Hell.

168
00:17:06,363 --> 00:17:09,193
I'm kind of busy right now. "
You know what I mean?

169
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,693
I'm made in my heavenly
Father's image.

170
00:17:11,728 --> 00:17:14,993
If I got a sense of humor,
that mean God got one.

171
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:17,775
God probably up there cracking
up right now.

172
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:22,319
"Hey, Jesus, come here!
That crazy nigga I made is on!

173
00:17:22,854 --> 00:17:27,828
"He talking about you, boy.
He said you walk on your bathwater.

174
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:29,993
"He said you whistle
like this.... "

175
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:33,923
"Ah, don't get mad. That shit was funny.
It was funny. "

176
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:08,625
See, I'd be a Muslim, but the Muslim
faith, they too strict.

177
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,090
You know what I mean?
You can't smoke no weed.

178
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,888
You can't get your dick sucked
by a bitch that ain't your wife.

179
00:18:14,923 --> 00:18:18,826
Matter of fact, you can't see your
wife's face until you marry her.

180
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:21,625
They keep 'em veiled up.
All you get to see is the eyes.

181
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,592
You really got to love
that bitch's eyes.

182
00:18:25,827 --> 00:18:30,090
You be like, "Damn.
She got some pretty eyes. "

183
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:33,588
Then you marry her ass,
the veil come off.

184
00:18:37,923 --> 00:18:43,128
No wonder they get 20 wives.
You playing the law of averages.

185
00:18:44,763 --> 00:18:47,828
I'm telling you, I think Christians
are jealous of Muslims,

186
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:53,044
'cause you ain't gonna out-devout a Muslim.
That's the most devout faith you'll ever run into.

187
00:18:53,437 --> 00:18:58,832
A Muslim will strap a bomb on they self
and blow they self up about some Muhammad.

188
00:18:59,228 --> 00:19:05,128
Ask a Christian to put a bomb on
and blow they self up about Jesus.

189
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:08,528
"Naw, He wouldn't want me
to do that. "

190
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:19,674
"He just blessed me with this house.
I'm sure He wants me to live in it. "

191
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:31,291
Everybody fighting over
this religion shit. You understand me?

192
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:35,577
The Christians say Jesus is the messenger.
The Muslims say it's Muhammad.

193
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:40,826
I say, "Who gives a fuck who the messenger is?
Did you get the message?"

194
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,993
They got the same
damn message.

195
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:54,928
Do unto others as you would
have them do unto you.

196
00:19:54,963 --> 00:19:57,628
Science proves that to be a fact.
For every action,

197
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,929
there's an opposite and equal reaction.

198
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:05,028
Don't fuck with me,
and I won't fuck with you.

199
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:13,928
I'll tell you somebody who needs
Jesus right around now.

200
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,893
Tiger Woods.

201
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:17,028
What I like about tiger,
he kept it golf. He had 18 hos.

202
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:21,388
One for every hole of golf.

203
00:21:47,562 --> 00:21:50,291
Now, here's where Tiger
messed up.

204
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:53,827
Now, fellas, I want y'all to look at
the woman sitting next to you

205
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:57,392
that you brought here.
Look at her right now!

206
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,590
Now, you see how fine she is?

207
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:04,423
Don't ever fuck nothing
uglier than her.

208
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:10,326
You don't fuck down.
You fuck up.

209
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:20,291
You fuck a woman uglier than your
woman, she gonna be madder
than a motherfucker.

210
00:22:20,326 --> 00:22:24,727
"Nigga, I know I look better than that bitch!
Nigga, what's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?"

211
00:22:24,862 --> 00:22:28,294
That's when they go crazy.
"What the fuck is wrong with me?

212
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:31,826
I look better than that bitch!
What's wrong with me?"

213
00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:40,527
You fuck a bitch that's finer than your
woman, she gonna act like she mad,

214
00:22:40,562 --> 00:22:42,692
but she can't get mad.

215
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:48,027
She gonna look at him like, "Shit, I didn't
know that nigga could catch that.

216
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:51,125
I'ma have to step
my game up. "

217
00:22:55,727 --> 00:23:00,192
Rich black man and white woman
don't go together.

218
00:23:00,227 --> 00:23:05,325
Ask O. J., Kobe, Tiger woods.
It ain't no good.

219
00:23:12,527 --> 00:23:17,125
'Cause white women will
set your ass up.

220
00:23:19,727 --> 00:23:22,326
See, everybody think a sister
is the strongest motherfucking
woman on earth.

221
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:26,027
To an extent, that is true, but at least
a sister will let you know up front.

222
00:23:26,062 --> 00:23:31,590
"Nigga, I will fuck you up. "

223
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:34,727
You know what you dealing with.

224
00:23:34,762 --> 00:23:36,423
White women... sneaky.

225
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,888
"Really?"

226
00:23:38,923 --> 00:23:42,692
"Is like that, Tom?"

227
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:49,027
She get on the phone.
"Hello? Officer?"

228
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:51,492
"He raped me... "

229
00:23:51,627 --> 00:23:55,891
White women play victim
quick than a motherfucker.

230
00:23:56,326 --> 00:23:58,590
But that white man gotta learn
from you white women.

231
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:02,388
See, when that white man
get mad, he get mad.

232
00:24:02,423 --> 00:24:07,227
You know, brothers, we get mad,
we march "We shall overcome..."

233
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:11,994
You know, we get a good March in,
Misspell signs, we gone.

234
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:16,378
That white man get mad, he snap.

235
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:20,820
You know, white women like,
"I'm taking the kids. I'm taking the house.

236
00:24:20,855 --> 00:24:24,892
We're gone.
We're out of here, you asshole. "

237
00:24:25,027 --> 00:24:31,227
That white man be like this.
"I came from a long line of brookshires.

238
00:24:31,462 --> 00:24:35,791
You're not gonna take my seed
from me, Guinevere. "

239
00:24:35,826 --> 00:24:42,625
Now, here's the one sentence
that white man got for they ass.
"Over my dead body. "

240
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,527
And that motherfucker
mean that shit.

241
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:47,692
"Over my dead body".

242
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:54,625
I'll kill you. Then I'll kill the kids.
I'll burn the fucking house to the ground,
then I'll do myself. "

243
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:04,090
Brother can't even try that shit. Sister
be like, "Nigga, I'm leaving you. "

244
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:08,925
"I'ma kill you". "You killing who?
Let the killing begin, motherfucker!

245
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:16,090
Nigga be like, "I'm just
playing, girl. I'm just playing.

246
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:19,826
You know I'm joking with you, girl.
You know I'm joking with you.

247
00:25:19,861 --> 00:25:23,227
We don't even get to the part
of burning the house down and the kids.

248
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:31,127
They always try to make it like
everybody's after the white woman.

249
00:25:31,128 --> 00:25:34,328
You look at the movies.
King kong after the bitch.

250
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:39,027
You all know damn well this is
a nigga story...

251
00:25:39,062 --> 00:25:41,692
The big old gorilla...

252
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:47,326
He had all them fine African sisters
and one white woman and lose his mind.

253
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:50,291
That's why they call it "Jungle fever".

254
00:25:50,326 --> 00:25:55,527
That motherfucker Kong got that white
bitch. Nigga, he picked her up.
Just blowing on the ho.

255
00:25:56,762 --> 00:25:59,791
"I got my white bitch!
I got my white bitch!"

256
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:05,391
They took his white bitch.
That motherfucker swam to New York.

257
00:26:05,826 --> 00:26:11,125
They took the bitch up on a building.
"Where's my white bitch?

258
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,227
I need my white bitch!"

259
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:42,891
They got some new
kind of white women now.

260
00:27:43,326 --> 00:27:48,227
You know, I'm in my 40s.
You know, I remember when all
white women had straight backs.

261
00:27:48,262 --> 00:27:50,791
You know what I mean?
No ass. Just a long back.

262
00:27:50,826 --> 00:27:54,625
You know, you could lay 'em down,
get a good crease in your pants.

263
00:27:57,027 --> 00:28:02,923
Now they got some ass on 'em.
I don't know what you white
women are eating, but keep it up.

264
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:05,992
'Cause they'd be walking down the street.
¶ ga-gonk ga-gonk ¶

265
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:09,423
"You got competition,
Laqueisha. "

266
00:28:16,423 --> 00:28:20,323
'Cause, you know, every city I go to
on tour, there's always the brother

267
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:22,692
with the white woman.

268
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:28,176
Now, brothers, let me ask y'all something,
'cause I see a couple of y'all
here with your white women.

269
00:28:28,511 --> 00:28:33,625
Why, when y'all get a white woman,
y'all get the ugliest white bitch in town?

270
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:41,625
And be walking proud with 'em.
"Yeah, this is mine. "

271
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,692
Holding hands and shit.
You know what I mean?

272
00:28:44,727 --> 00:28:47,192
Brothers don't even hold hands
with they own sister.
You know what I mean?

273
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:50,027
You watch a brother walking down
a street. Sister be behind 'em.

274
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,028
"I'm with you. "
"Come on. Keep up. "

275
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:56,125
Nigga get a white woman,
act like he hit the jackpot.

276
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,923
"Yes, I got her. "

277
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:09,125
But when you see a white man
with a sister... Oh, they get
the baddest sister they got in town.

278
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:14,326
Oh, white boys don't fuck around.
When they get a sister, they get a sistah.

279
00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:18,227
And they be walking, holding hands.
"Goddamn right I got her. "

280
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:24,527
"I'm gonna teach her
how to Riverdance. "

281
00:29:32,923 --> 00:29:36,624
Nothing against you white people.
Y'all just different.

282
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,791
You know how them motherfuckers say
they don't like black people, right?

283
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:44,223
And the ones that I'm talking about,
I'm talking about you. Not all white people.

284
00:29:44,258 --> 00:29:48,191
There's some cool motherfuckers.
You're here.

285
00:29:49,026 --> 00:29:51,792
Obviously, motherfucker,
you're here.

286
00:29:52,027 --> 00:29:57,592
But you know the ones I'm talking about,
them motherfucking racist sons of bitches.

287
00:29:57,927 --> 00:30:03,976
"I don't like black people. "
Well, why you lay out in the sun
and try to become black?

288
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:11,425
You don't see black people laying out
in the moonlight trying to lighten up.

289
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:17,423
Like, "brother, what you doing?"
"Nigga, I'm trying to get that prince tone.

290
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:21,692
Morris day up in this bitch. "

291
00:30:21,727 --> 00:30:24,492
Be happy to be white,
white folks.

292
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:27,923
Y'all ain't even white,
Really. Y'all colored.

293
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:30,791
Y'all should all join the NAACP.

294
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,826
Nationa Association For Advancement
of Colored People

295
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,291
You understand me?
'Cause y'all colored people.

296
00:30:57,326 --> 00:31:02,125
Only white people can
turn red when they mad. Look at 'em.

297
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,090
They blush.
They're a little pink.

298
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:08,326
When you hit 'em,
they blue and purple.

299
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:46,643
SAN DIEGO. SAN FRANCISCO.
SAN JOSE.

300
00:38:09,562 --> 00:38:12,992
Nigga!

301
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:54,591
You motherfuckers.

302
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:51,492
I don't.

303
01:20:15,861 --> 01:20:21,326
If I'm in that second set, I would have
been like, "Hey, hey, hold the fuck up.

304
01:20:21,361 --> 01:20:23,725
"Them was your black belts."

305
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:28,443
"My shit is orange!"

306
01:20:28,478 --> 01:20:33,091
"You the teacher. Teach!"

307
01:20:33,126 --> 01:20:37,126
"Now, if you whoop his ass,
I'll keep taking your class."

308
01:20:37,161 --> 01:20:40,391
"If not, I'm about to study
with that motherfucker."

309
01:20:41,026 --> 01:20:45,826
I'm Eddie Griffin. Y'all been wonderful.
Good night, Oakland, baby.
