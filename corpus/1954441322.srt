1
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,904
<i>In the
spring of 1946,</i>

2
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:40,339
<i>in the small town
 of Texarkana,</i>

3
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,542
<i>on the
 Texas-Arkansas border,</i>

4
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,244
<i>a series of horrific murders
 were committed</i>

5
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,579
<i>by a masked assailant
 known only as
 "The Phantom Killer."</i>

6
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,249
<i>For three harrowing months,</i>

7
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,354
<i>the Phantom stalked the
back roads of Texarkana,</i>

8
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:59,425
<i>following young couples
looking for privacy to
isolated areas,</i>

9
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:03,262
<i>where their screams
 for help would go
 unanswered.</i>

10
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:07,266
<i>Though several arrests
 were made in connection
 with the brutal slayings,</i>

11
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,568
<i>which ended as suddenly
as they began,</i>

12
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,905
<i>the killer's identity
 was never confirmed.</i>

13
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,342
<i>Indeed, many people
 who lived through
 that nightmare time</i>

14
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:20,179
<i>believed the Phantom spent
 the rest of his days free,</i>

15
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,281
<i>walking the streets
 of Texarkana</i>

16
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:22,949
<i>quietly, anonymously,
until his assumed death.</i>

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,389
<i>In 1976, a film inspired
by the infamous</i>

18
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,192
<i>Moonlight Murders
 was released.</i>

19
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,462
<i>Every year, on Halloween,
</i> The Town That
Dreaded Sundown

20
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:40,199
<i>is screened somewhere
 in Texarkana,</i>

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,267
<i>in tribute to the Phantom's
 legacy of death and blood.</i>

22
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,241
<i>Today, Texarkana is a place
 haunted by its past,</i>

23
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:52,378
<i>defined by a mystery
 that was never solved,</i>

24
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,815
<i>and a tragedy that
 could never be forgotten.</i>

25
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,751
<i>The following happened
in Texarkana last year.</i>

26
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,941
<i>Sammy! Sammy!</i>

27
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,750
You're not enjoying
this, are you?

28
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,518
Oh, I just don't like
these kinds of films
so much.

29
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:35,955
Why didn't you say so?

30
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,125
We can go.

31
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,193
Really? Do you mean it?

32
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,269
<i>Stop it!</i>

33
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,615
I mean, man, the last time
I saw this movie was
when I was, like, 12.

34
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,655
God bless you
and the Texarkana Fellowship
Church invites you

35
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,390
to stop the Devil
with gospel.

36
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,033
- Hello, sister.
- You take a look at this now.

37
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,370
This is a godless film
that you're watching here.

38
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,673
And I want you to listen
to my broadcast on Friday

39
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,909
and come to church
on Sunday.

40
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,577
I'll tell you
all about it.

41
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,919
Welcome back.
 This is KYGL,
 Oldies on the Border.

42
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,021
<i>It's Halloween night,
 so if you're sitting
 at home,</i>

43
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:44,190
<i>waiting for the
 trick-or-treaters
 to come by,</i>

44
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,192
<i>we'll keep you company with
 our usual bag of tricks.</i>

45
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:49,061
Real people died,
you know, young man.

46
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,930
Real people died.

47
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,531
That's right.
That's right.

48
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,401
It's a godless film
and I want to see you
on Sunday.

49
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:55,801
We welcome you.

50
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,705
That's good. You leave.
This is a godless film.

51
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,610
It's good that
you're leavin'.

52
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,209
What?

53
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,979
I'm just having
a good time
with you, Jami.

54
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:12,144
The only reason I play
football is to get a
scholarship and go to SMU.

55
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:15,347
Yeah?

56
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,851
And how about you?
Where'd you apply?

57
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,319
Mmm.
You did apply, right?

58
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,856
You're, like,
super smart.

59
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,659
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.

60
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,495
I applied
to UT Austin,

61
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,096
NYU,

62
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:31,697
and Cal State.

63
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,533
Wow.

64
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,035
That's impressive.

65
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,771
Oh, I probably won't get in,
but, you know, aim high.

66
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,206
You should.

67
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,046
My dad used to write
for the <i>Gazette,</i> actually.

68
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,315
My grandma says
it's in my blood, so...

69
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,382
Even though no one reads it,

70
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,951
I like writing for the paper.

71
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,052
I could do that from here

72
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,954
and stay close to my grandma.

73
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,388
If I don't get in.

74
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,623
Right.

75
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,895
Well, I'm glad
you finally said yes.

76
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:05,898
Me, too.

77
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,824
Wait.

78
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:32,224
What? Did I...
Did I do something wrong?

79
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,361
No.

80
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,601
What the hell
is he doing?

81
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,906
He's just
a Peeping Tom.

82
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,008
He's not gonna
do anything.

83
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,876
Corey,
we don't know that.

84
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:52,878
But look.

85
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,282
See?
He just wanted a show.

86
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:01,954
He's just some asshole
from the drive-in.

87
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,727
Let's just go, though.
Is that okay?

88
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:11,764
Yeah.

89
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,136
Get out of the car.

90
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,737
Don't, Jami.
Stay in the car.

91
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,640
Get out of the fucking car
or I'll shoot her
in the face.

92
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,425
Do your momma and daddy
know where you were
tonight, boy?

93
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:40,626
The movie.

94
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:40,926
Yes.

95
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:42,628
Well, what about yours?

96
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,131
They're dead.

97
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,505
Take your pants off.

98
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,073
What?
Take off your
fucking pants.

99
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,476
Corey, just do it.

100
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:00,079
Okay, all right.

101
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,415
Come on, man.

102
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,585
Get down on the
fuckin' ground.

103
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,619
Okay.
All right, I am.

104
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,091
I'm not gonna
run anywhere.

105
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,195
Now... Now, please,
can you just let her go?

106
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,365
No.

107
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,734
Please don't kill him.

108
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,302
You.

109
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:24,970
Turn around.

110
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,206
Do not look back.

111
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,545
All right,
if you want money,

112
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,482
I can get you money.

113
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,217
I don't want money.
What do you want?

114
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,885
I said don't
look back.

115
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,054
What are you doing?
What are...
What are you...

116
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,791
Shut the fuck up!
What are you doin'?

117
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,626
Shut the fuck up.

118
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,228
Shut the fuck up!
What are you doing?

119
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,629
What the fuck
are you doin'...

120
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,130
Corey!

121
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:54,900
No!
Please, no!
No, please!

122
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,404
Please.

123
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,984
No.

124
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,086
You looked.

125
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,124
This is for Mary.

126
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,559
Make them remember.

127
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,140
<i>What are you doing?
 No, please don't hurt me.</i>

128
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,187
- Who is that?
- What?

129
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,189
<i>Oh, no. Please don't hurt me.</i>

130
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,324
- Is she okay?
- Are you okay?

131
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,326
This is
 Texarkana 911.
 What is your emergency?

132
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,331
We're at the
 Twin Star Drive-In.

133
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,934
We need an ambulance
 and the police.

134
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:13,372
<i>Is someone injured?</i>

135
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:14,506
<i>Yes. Um, a girl and
 maybe her boyfriend,
 I don't know.She is hysterical.</i>

136
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,008
<i>All right.
 All right.</i>

137
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,776
He was
on top of me.

138
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,881
He could have killed me,
but he didn't.

139
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,683
You say the Phantom
told you something?

140
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,717
I don't know why,
but he said he was doin' it
for someone named Mary.

141
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,454
Were you drinkin'?
Doin' any drugs?

142
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,794
No.
Did the doctors find
any drugs in her?

143
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,796
Well, as a precaution,
we're gonna have someone
in front of your house.

144
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,199
I... I can do that.

145
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:43,235
Thank you.

146
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,471
Until we get some
more information,

147
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,540
Jami, we'd like to ask you
not to discuss any of this
with the press.

148
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,813
They've been
all over this story,
as you can imagine.

149
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,988
Once again, for those
 just joining us,

150
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,591
<i>24 hours after
 the shocking</i>

151
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:09,061
<i>Phantom-inspired murder
of a 17-year-old
high school student,</i>

152
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,229
<i>no arrests have been made.</i>

153
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,831
<i>It is unreasonable</i>

154
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,267
<i>to try and find meaning
in this grotesque</i>

155
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,702
<i>and godless crime,</i>

156
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:20,205
<i>but that is exactly what
 we must do as a community.</i>

157
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,506
<i>Like a lost reel</i>

158
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,742
<i>from</i>The Town That
Dreaded Sundown,

159
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,279
<i>the attack on Halloween night
 took place in a secluded,
 wooded cul-de-sac,</i>

160
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,947
<i>just off Highway 6,</i>

161
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,817
<i>an area that used to be
called Lovers' Lane.</i>

162
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,466
Grandma, do you remember
anything about the murders?

163
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,768
Oh, dear girl, barely.

164
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,204
Just what
I heard later.

165
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,640
You know,
your great-grandpa

166
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:58,210
and your great-grandma
lived in this house
when it happened.

167
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,978
I remember my momma
once said

168
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,047
that it was like the town
was being tested

169
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,882
and nobody knew why.

170
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:04,583
Even the grown-ups
were scared.

171
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,720
He was the bogeyman,
they said.

172
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,157
Can't catch
the bogeyman.

173
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:14,493
Can't kill the bogeyman.

174
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,631
His father is the devil
and his mother is a whore.

175
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,504
You know,
before that summer,

176
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:26,204
everybody would leave
their doors unlocked.

177
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,075
And after the summer,
you saw a stranger,

178
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,180
you wouldn't wave hello.

179
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,649
You'd just cross
the street.

180
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,285
And what about when
they made the movie?

181
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,853
What about it?

182
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,922
Were people
still afraid?

183
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,424
The Phantom?
No, that faded.

184
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:48,260
Nobody knew exactly
who he was

185
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,997
or what he did,

186
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,268
just that he'd
lived in this town

187
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,503
and attacked some
teenagers on
Lovers' Lane.

188
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,307
And then the movie
brought it all back.

189
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,591
This is for Mary.

190
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,202
REVEREND CARTWRIGHT
Humility,
 devotion, sacrifice.

191
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,644
Mr. Holland,

192
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,413
I just wanted you
to know that
he was so brave.

193
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,650
You left
my baby boy!

194
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,319
Margaret.
You slut!

195
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,021
Margaret.
You slut! You left him!

196
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,323
It won't bring him back.

197
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,492
You left my
baby boy!
It won't...

198
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,128
I want my baby!

199
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,830
Given what
 you've been through,

200
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,831
I'd like to prescribe
a mild anti-anxiety
medication to help you...

201
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,971
No, ma'am.
Um, no, thank you.

202
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,973
I've spent the
last seven years
on all different kinds

203
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:50,141
of medication after my
parents passed away.

204
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,510
<i>I'm not interested in
 anything like that.</i>

205
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,879
In your file I read that
you applied to colleges.

206
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,215
To study, um...

207
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,719
Creative writing.

208
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,721
I'm not sure it's
something I'm ready for,

209
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,723
or made for that,
and leaving town...

210
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:05,657
I don't want to.
Especially not now.

211
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,494
What about these dreams
you've been having?

212
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,199
What do you think
they're about?

213
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,033
About Corey?

214
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,537
Well,

215
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,507
Corey asked me out
and I was flattered.

216
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,544
I don't get asked out
all that much.

217
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,482
So I just wanted to
show him that...

218
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,386
I...

219
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,359
That I was...

220
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,427
Grateful?

221
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,129
Yeah.

222
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,331
So, when he suggested
that we leave the movie,

223
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,238
I thought we could
go someplace.

224
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,139
And even if we just
kissed for a little while,
he would like me more.

225
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:57,876
You didn't do anything
wrong, Jami.

226
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,319
He was just
a really good person.

227
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:11,556
He was just a really good
person and he didn't
deserve that.

228
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,362
He tried to protect me.

229
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,633
Jami.

230
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,970
Try writing
about this.

231
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,374
It might help you
find a way through it.

232
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,424
Baby!

233
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,304
Glad you made it
home safe, baby!

234
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:05,043
You feel that, baby?
That's for you! Yes!

235
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,316
Oh, baby. I'm sore.
I need a break.

236
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:18,523
We've got four
 in a row for you on KYGL.

237
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,859
There's a machine
by the stairs.

238
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,193
If they got cookies,

239
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,828
get me some cookies.

240
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,864
I need the sugar.

241
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,699
I love you, baby.

242
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,566
I love you, baby.

243
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,882
Hey, knock when
you come back.

244
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,683
So I know it's you.

245
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,428
Help me! Help!

246
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,699
Help!

247
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:11,703
Help!

248
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,386
No!

249
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,615
Hello?

250
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:03,488
I'm going to do it
 again and again until you
 make them remember.

251
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,258
I think I need
to tell someone.

252
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,662
Well, you
just did. Me.

253
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,200
I mean, like a reporter
at the news or something.

254
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:16,701
He said he was
gonna do it again,

255
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,604
and if he has a message
and he's using me
to get it out,

256
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,372
I have to say
something. It's...

257
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:25,543
And...
And he's using you why?
'Cause he likes you?

258
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,713
Um...

259
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,149
I don't know.

260
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,154
Miss Lerner,
I promise you

261
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,157
we will
investigate this.

262
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:41,292
I will personally make sure
that it's investigated.

263
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:44,562
Thank you.

264
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,435
I just don't understand
why he thinks
we deserve this.

265
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,638
Well,

266
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:55,874
I'll tell you what,
I wasn't born in
Texarkana,

267
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:01,546
but I've been around
here long enough
to know one thing.

268
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,982
And that's that
just about everyone
around here

269
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,150
has got some kind of
blood on their hands.

270
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,224
Three weeks
 after the shocking death

271
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,926
<i>of high school senior
 Corey Holland,</i>

272
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:17,562
<i>the town of Texarkana
 has awoken yet again</i>

273
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,664
<i>to another gruesome
 act of violence.</i>

274
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,766
<i>This time, two people
 were found dead.</i>

275
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,035
Corporal Daniel Torrens
 was coming home

276
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:27,171
<i>to spend Thanksgiving
 with his girlfriend,
 Kendra Collins,</i>

277
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,706
<i>when they checked
 into this motel...</i>

278
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,241
<i>At a few minutes
past midnight,</i>

279
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,110
<i>the couple was
 attacked and killed,</i>

280
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,946
<i>their bodies mutilated
 almost beyond recognition.</i>

281
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,115
A heart full of hate,
 that'll do it.

282
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:40,118
A soul consumed
by vengeance. Sin.

283
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:43,388
<i>The Sheriff's
office has been in contact
with the Texas Rangers</i>

284
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:45,123
<i>to help with
 the investigation.</i>

285
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:48,092
<i>But in the meantime,
 a Town Hall meeting
 has been scheduled.</i>

286
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,596
Reverend Cartwright,
will you lead us
in a word of prayer?

287
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:02,407
Our Dear Heavenly Father,

288
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,976
we ask you to deliver us
through this trial,

289
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:05,276
shield us during this
time of fire and blood,

290
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,382
of confusion and despair.

291
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,985
We ask you to lend us
some of your strength

292
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:16,554
and give it to these
fine young men and women

293
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,323
that they may
help guide us

294
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:21,059
through this forest
of fear and darkness...

295
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,628
<i>This town,
where I was born,</i>

296
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:23,995
<i>where I grew up, is the
 only place I've ever known.</i>

297
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,399
Amen.

298
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,238
The Mayor's asked us
to hold this forum

299
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,441
to give you an update
and hear your concerns.

300
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:37,909
Well, an update
would be great!

301
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:42,180
<i>People are saying
the Phantom is back.</i>

302
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,015
<i>That after 60 some years
he's come back and that
we need to be ready.</i> Ma'am, he'd be
100 years old.

303
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:48,019
Every time we show
that GD movie, there's
a GD party out there!

304
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,520
The Phantom
 is our dirty secret.

305
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:53,024
That movie will never be
shown in Texarkana again.

306
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,026
Not on the Texas side.

307
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,995
And not on the
Arkansas side, either.

308
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,963
And while you're at it,
why don't you tear down

309
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,198
that statue of Jim Bowie?

310
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,833
Isn't he holding one
of them GD knives?

311
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,668
Why don't you
rip that down?

312
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,336
<i>Everyone knows
some piece of the story,</i>

313
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,605
<i>but the whole truth
has been all but buried.</i>

314
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,541
Oh, we're all so surprised
that the Phantom's back?

315
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,210
Of course he is.

316
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,277
You can't leave a candle

317
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,812
burning in a window
for someone

318
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,115
and then be surprised
when he finally shows up!

319
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:20,051
Amen. Amen,
sister, Amen.

320
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:23,121
<i>Most of the people
alive back then
are no longer with us.</i>

321
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:24,722
<i>Or they just don't
 want to remember.</i>

322
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:25,990
Then you shutter
the bars.

323
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,159
But everything
 comes back.

324
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,962
<i>The past is alive,
 all around us.</i>

325
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,296
Order!

326
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,800
"Disciples of Evil."
That's what my daddy said.

327
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,417
Hi.

328
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,487
The library's paper
archives only go back
for 10 years.

329
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,389
They said I should
come here if I was
looking for articles

330
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,924
in the <i>Gazette</i>from
the '40s and '50s.

331
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,259
Stuff about the Phantom?

332
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,659
Yes.

333
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,830
Uh, all the best stuff
is upstairs. In the jail.

334
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,444
Listen up!

335
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,446
As of this moment,
the Texas Rangers are in
charge of this investigation.

336
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:30,621
Specifically, I am.

337
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,590
They moved everything
in here when they
decommissioned the prison.Now we just
use if for storage.

338
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:32,857
All of our archives
and files.
It's in here.

339
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,261
Trust me,
I understand how you
feel right now.

340
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:41,899
I once had a Texas Ranger
come into my house,
and it wasn't easy.

341
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,972
Sparkplug,
give us the room.

342
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,712
Now, let's get down
to business.

343
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:58,816
I want open, clear lines
of communication between
Texas and Arkansas.

344
00:26:58,817 --> 00:26:58,983
One person from each side
reporting directly to me.

345
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,323
So are you just
casually interested, or...

346
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:07,492
I don't think we'll
figure out who the
Phantom is now

347
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:10,461
unless we figure out
who he was back then.

348
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,763
Cool.
<i>We have
two jobs, friends.</i>

349
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,065
To capture this bastard

350
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:16,300
and to keep the good
people of Texarkana

351
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,935
from killing each other
out of fear.

352
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,771
We are not
huntin' a ghost.

353
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:21,472
We are after
a flesh and blood,
cold-blooded killer,

354
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,577
who, up to this point,

355
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,113
has not made one mistake.

356
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,115
Due respect, Ranger Morales...

357
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,350
Call me Lone Wolf.

358
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,252
I think very highly
of myself,

359
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:35,019
and I've also earned it.

360
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,958
Uh, due respect,
Lone Wolf,
he was videotaped.

361
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,827
I'd like to
see that footage.

362
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,795
Oh, and the movie.

363
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:45,129
Believe it or not, I've
never had the pleasure
of seeing it.

364
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:53,604
Everything
from 1945 to 1952
is gonna be in here.

365
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,490
You know how that works?
The microfiche?

366
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:14,325
They were gonna throw
it out, and I said,
"Hey, why?

367
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:15,960
"You know, it works.
Bring it here."

368
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,800
Well...

369
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:23,901
Well, thanks.

370
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,807
Yeah. Good luck.

371
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:59,737
Oh, shit, sorry.

372
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,871
You're Jami Lerner,
aren't you?

373
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:04,108
I'm Nick.

374
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:06,344
I went to Evans High
with you.

375
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,916
We were in the same
chem class.

376
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:12,450
We were?

377
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,453
Yeah, you sat
in the front
to the side.

378
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,188
I sat in the back
to the other side.

379
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:19,423
And when
I recognized you,
I thought...

380
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:23,261
"Holy shit, that's her,
and I hope she's okay."

381
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,298
That's all.
I just wanted to
see if you're okay.

382
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:34,538
Yeah, I am.

383
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,143
Oh, and, uh,
give you this.

384
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,979
It's the greatest hits
the <i>Gazette</i> published back
when it was happening.

385
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,948
And then they did
a retrospective.

386
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,650
It's usually $12
for xeroxing, but you can...

387
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:46,651
Don't worry about it.
Just go ahead.

388
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,887
Thanks.

389
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,825
Well, I'll just be
downstairs,
manning the desk,

390
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,394
if you need anything.

391
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,215
From the KYGL
 on the Border family

392
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,784
<i>to your family,
 stay safe out there.</i>

393
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,555
<i>If you do go out,
 go out in a group,
 and don't play hero.</i>

394
00:30:57,556 --> 00:31:00,191
<i>You see someone
 that looks suspicious
 comin' your way,</i>

395
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,426
<i>cross to the other side
of the street, will you?</i>

396
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,371
Oh, my God.

397
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,340
<i>"They couldn't catch me
66 years ago</i>

398
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:50,875
<i>"and they never will.</i>

399
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,777
<i>"I come and go as I please.</i>

400
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,578
<i>"I kill when I please.</i>

401
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:54,845
<i>"You may think I'm
 a horrible, sick murderer,</i>

402
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:58,282
<i>"but I'm not.</i>

403
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,886
<i>"I love my neighbors.</i>

404
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:05,723
<i>"I wish they would stop
and let my soul
rest in peace."</i>

405
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,958
"For you see,
I am the soul of Texarkana.

406
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:08,192
"I am the reckoning
foretold."

407
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,296
Oh, look,
I can understand how
this can be upsetting,

408
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:18,269
but it's also
most likely a fake.

409
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,371
Well, the Zodiac,
he sent a manifesto
to the press and...

410
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:22,406
Yes. And so did
the Son of Sam,

411
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,275
and the Axeman
of New Orleans,

412
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,977
but to reporters,
not teenagers.

413
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,413
We all realize it could
be a hoax, Deputy.

414
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,449
But until it's
100% confirmed,

415
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,552
we will take it
and this young lady
seriously.

416
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:36,921
I want my entire team
to hear what
you have to say.

417
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:37,721
If you think
it's important,
we think it's important.

418
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:40,991
Well, um...

419
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:43,494
I've been researching
the original case,

420
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,498
and going through
the court transcripts.

421
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:49,433
Do you know who
Benjamin Sewell is?

422
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:52,837
He was a car thief,
arrested in 1946
in Texarkana

423
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:54,672
for possession of
a stolen automobile.

424
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:57,174
A lot of people
think that he was
the Phantom because...

425
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:58,742
Well, the killing stopped
once he was arrested.

426
00:32:58,743 --> 00:32:59,443
How long was he in for?

427
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:02,513
- Thirty years.
- Thirty years.

428
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,649
And then
Benjamin Sewell died,
Ms. Lerner.

429
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,585
Yes, sir.
He died last summer.

430
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,153
In a hospital
in Fort Worth.

431
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,856
I spoke to a nurse
that worked at the hospital,

432
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:13,524
um, since before
Benjamin died...

433
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,025
Now, come on,
we don't have
time for this.

434
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,361
Hold on.
She said a young man
used to visit him.

435
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:18,963
His son, they thought.

436
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:20,664
What if it's him?

437
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,433
That the passing of his
father set him off

438
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:23,033
and he came back here
to finish his father's work?

439
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,871
Benjamin Sewell did
have a son, Ms. Lerner,

440
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:30,040
but he died
in a bar fight
two years ago.

441
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:33,277
He did?

442
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:35,045
It's all right, Jami.

443
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,616
We went down that
same rabbit hole.

444
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,554
<i>This is KYGL,</i>

445
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,823
<i>Oldies on the Border,
and if you've got us on,</i>

446
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:48,726
<i>you're probably getting
 ready for the big football
 game this weekend.</i>

447
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:52,363
<i>The Texas High Tigers
 versus the Arkansas
 High Razorbacks.</i>

448
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,732
<i>It's gonna be
 a blood match, folks.</i>

449
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,033
<i>But as always...</i>

450
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,375
He said he'd shoot me
if I got any closer.

451
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,243
Well, that's
his job.

452
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,912
How'd it go
at the station?

453
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:10,180
Uh, not so well.

454
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,517
It's no surprise.

455
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,753
Grandma, this is...
Nick Strain.

456
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,821
I went to the same
high school as Jami.

457
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,423
Hmm. And now?

458
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,559
I work at the archives.
Uh, researcher.

459
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,762
I found you some really
cool stuff from back when
they were making the movie.

460
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,697
You know,
some of those people
are still around. So...

461
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,365
Uh, no college, huh?

462
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,000
Just making
some money first.

463
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:30,768
Family?
Grandma.

464
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:33,103
My parents moved to
Denton last year,

465
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,207
so I'm living with
some buddies.

466
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,842
I'll be in
in a minute, okay?

467
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,244
All right.

468
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,116
Sorry about that.

469
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,118
You want to sit down?

470
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,287
You know, they did
tons of research
for the movie.

471
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,922
The director and his son.

472
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,828
Thanks for
bringing me
this stuff.

473
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:58,596
Yeah.

474
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,098
Can I ask why
you're helping me
with all this?

475
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,803
I always wanted to
talk to you.

476
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,544
Why didn't you?

477
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:16,080
Didn't think I'd get very far.

478
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,416
I never saw you with a...

479
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,622
Boyfriend or friends or...
I asked around and...

480
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,323
I was like,
"What's her story?"

481
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,458
Then someone
told me about...

482
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,128
About my parents?

483
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,096
Or that for the last
seven years I've been
totally out of it and...

484
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,467
Both.

485
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,169
My parents didn't
really move to Denton.

486
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,141
I just said that 'cause

487
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,576
I didn't want your
grandma to think I was
this, you know,

488
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:49,913
basket case.

489
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,685
Which, of course,
now I really seem
like one.

490
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:55,586
Where are they?

491
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,856
Well, my dad killed
himself last year.

492
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,426
He was an, um, an alcoholic,

493
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:08,365
and my mom, uh, kinda...

494
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:12,836
She just got lost after that.

495
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,040
Um, she's at Trans-Allegheny.

496
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:19,109
Well, it's a loony bin.

497
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:23,347
Oh, hey, um,
they're having a vigil
tonight at the school.

498
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,953
For the soldier
and his girlfriend.

499
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:33,290
And for Corey.

500
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,027
You wanna go?

501
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,337
You don't
 mean that fellow they call
 the Lone Wolf

502
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:47,504
<i>- of the Texas Rangers?
- That's right.

503
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,674
Hmm.

504
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,213
Since I'm in charge
 of this investigation, things are gonna have
 to be handled my way.

505
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,348
<i>We got a cold-blooded
 killer here.</i>

506
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,983
<i>A man who nobody sees.</i>

507
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:00,517
<i>A Phantom who</i>

508
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,921
<i>so far hasn't made
 any mistakes.</i>

509
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:12,429
<i>What are you doing?</i>

510
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,997
<i>No, please,
don't hurt me.</i>

511
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:14,431
<i>Please.</i>

512
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:22,005
I guess it was crazy
of me to think I could
help the police,

513
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,674
but I'm gonna
keep researching.

514
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:24,108
Keep writing.

515
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,911
Their stories need
to be told, so...

516
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,362
Arrest me.

517
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:55,866
- Arrest me!
- On the ground!

518
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:58,769
He killed Danny.
But I got him.
I got his ass!

519
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:07,010
- Jami.
- No! No, Nick...

520
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,579
Wait! No! I need to know!

521
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,085
Excuse me.
May I, please?

522
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,825
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
 Sheriff Underwood has
 just informed me</i>

523
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,760
<i>that the man who killed
Corey Holland,</i>

524
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,863
<i>the man who killed,
viciously, that couple,</i>

525
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,431
<i>that man has been shot,
 I'm told.</i>

526
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:02,332
<i>And I don't know
 what his condition is,</i>

527
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:06,570
<i>but I do know that
 no one else was hurt.</i>

528
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:06,770
<i>And that that, finally,
is something that
we can give thanks for.</i>

529
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:11,942
<i>Reverend Cartwright,</i>

530
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:14,845
<i>would you please lead us in
 a brief prayer of gratitude?</i>

531
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,785
Sweet Heavenly Father,
we have been delivered.

532
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:25,222
We praise the men
and women who have led us
through this darkness.

533
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:28,091
Sweet Jesus, thank you
for your mercy.

534
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,060
- Amen.
- Amen.

535
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,362
<i>Now, we've had
 a quiet night here.</i>

536
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,032
<i>But I do believe
that it would be
appropriate</i>

537
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,434
<i>for us to have a little
music that we could
dance to,</i>

538
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,604
<i>so, gentlemen,
I'm gonna lead you off.</i>

539
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,039
<i>One, two...

540
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,407
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

541
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:58,655
What was she doing?

542
00:40:58,656 --> 00:40:59,990
"A one..."

543
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:00,657
The worst dance
moves ever.

544
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:05,595
Straight home now.

545
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,298
Yes, sir.

546
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,177
It's right here.

547
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:35,359
Remember when we
used to come over here

548
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,727
and smoke cigarettes?

549
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:37,527
Thought we were
such hot shit.

550
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,785
So...

551
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,290
So how does this work?

552
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,558
I don't know.

553
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:10,894
I thought maybe
you could...

554
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:13,397
You know.

555
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:15,499
What?

556
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:17,634
You know.

557
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,671
Go down there,

558
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,841
and suck it.

559
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:26,710
Suck it?

560
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:28,745
I don't know.
Maybe a little?

561
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:31,515
What, is it hard?

562
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:35,285
Yeah.
Isn't yours?

563
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,086
Yeah.

564
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:41,358
You first.

565
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:43,393
And then I'll do you.

566
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:45,262
Maybe we could

567
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:47,431
jerk off together.

568
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,700
Dude, drive!

569
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:53,170
Come on!
Hurry up, come on!

570
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:56,833
Run, Johnny! Run!

571
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:02,239
No!

572
00:44:58,729 --> 00:44:59,863
Hi.

573
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,464
Who was that guy
at the vigil?

574
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,068
Name's Paul Mason.

575
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:07,637
A freshman over at
Texarkana College.

576
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:08,672
He's a messed up
kid but...

577
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:12,075
He's not the Phantom?
No.

578
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:15,912
Some stupid teenager
went out looking to
get shot.

579
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:16,246
Left a suicide note
in his dorm room.

580
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:19,883
But just because
he wanted to die

581
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:23,386
doesn't necessarily
mean he's not the
Phantom, right?

582
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,721
Hell, Jami...

583
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,930
I... I did not want
to tell you this

584
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,498
but you're...

585
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:36,766
There was another
murder last night.

586
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:40,270
It was two boys.

587
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:42,272
We're checking security
cameras at the scene,

588
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:45,442
but it does look like
it happened after
Paul Mason was shot.

589
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:56,119
It was Sunday,
 March 3rd, 1946.

590
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,623
<i>The beginning of a reign
of terror for the people
of Texarkana</i>

591
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:03,026
<i>and surrounding areas
 of Arkansas and Texas.</i>

592
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:03,994
Well, that's the most
god-awful thing I've done
in a long while.

593
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:07,864
They asked me if their...

594
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:10,200
Their sons

595
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:12,902
were dead before
he mutilated their bodies.

596
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,306
I lied.

597
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:19,142
I, uh, told 'em
as far as I could tell,

598
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:24,881
they had passed
before the worst of it.

599
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:25,548
Maybe they had.

600
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:27,584
They cried.

601
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:32,789
These two grown men,
I've known 'em
all their lives.

602
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:36,259
Since they were boys.

603
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:40,597
We catch him, we kill him,
that'll make it better.

604
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,334
That'll at least
bring them peace.

605
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:47,637
I agree.

606
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,004
To that end,

607
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:51,141
after our friend kills those
kids with the trombone,

608
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,679
who does he
go after next?

609
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:59,783
In the movie, after
the trombone killin',

610
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:03,119
there's a double homicide
at the farmhouse.

611
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:03,520
Every damn house
out here is a farmhouse.

612
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,457
<i>Texarkana looked normal</i>

613
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,595
<i>in the daylight hours
 but everyone dreaded
 sundown.</i>

614
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:15,031
Maybe I was
 wrong, Nick.

615
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,935
<i>Maybe there is no
connection to the past</i>

616
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:19,135
<i>and the Phantom is
 just the bogeyman.</i>

617
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:22,706
<i>Like my grandma says.</i>

618
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,878
<i>The first time I heard
 about the Phantom,
 I was eight years old.</i>

619
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:29,979
<i>I was at a sleepover at
 my friend Chrissie's house.</i>

620
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:43,960
<i>I called my parents
 to come pick me up.</i>

621
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,632
And that was the night
of the crash.

622
00:47:58,242 --> 00:47:59,442
That night in the woods,
he was on top of me

623
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:03,079
and I thought,
"This is it."

624
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:07,150
You know, it should have
happened when I was
eight years old.

625
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:09,452
It's finally
caught up to me now.

626
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:12,756
<i>Death.</i>

627
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:15,024
It's following me
and it's only
a matter of time.

628
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:20,897
I guess I'm a little
messed up.

629
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,566
I don't think you are.

630
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,134
Well, yeah, that's just
'cause you are, too.
Good.

631
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,776
Nick, what are
you doing?
 It's okay.

632
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:34,177
No, it's not okay!

633
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:34,878
I thought that...

634
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,313
I can't believe
you just did that.

635
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:38,948
Look, I'm sorry,
I just thought that
we had this...

636
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,919
I need you to get out
of the car right now.

637
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,787
Nick, I mean it!
Get out of the car!

638
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,958
Are you serious?

639
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:15,051
Oh, that looks just fine.

640
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,120
Mmm-hmm.
That's very nice.

641
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,588
You got everything now,
the scallops?
Yes.

642
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:20,056
The potatoes
and the ham?

643
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:21,825
Ranger.

644
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:23,493
Hank.

645
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,996
Well, Merry Christmas.

646
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,298
Merry Christmas,
Reverend.
Merry Christmas, Joe.

647
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,000
Well, what can I do
for you gentlemen?

648
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,572
Is there a place
the three of us can
go and talk, Joe?

649
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,075
Mmm-hmm.

650
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,346
I didn't send
this e-mail.

651
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,083
Well, the FBI traced it
back to you, Joe, so...

652
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,321
Why'd you send it
to the girl?

653
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:53,923
To muddy up the waters?

654
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:56,493
I don't know
what to tell you.

655
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:59,496
Here's what I think.
I don't think you
killed anybody.

656
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:00,430
But I do believe
you sent this message.

657
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,200
See, I hear you
at night, preachin'.

658
00:50:07,872 --> 00:50:10,373
Nothin' much for me
to do in my hotel room,

659
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:13,276
so I wonder,
"Are you doing this
for publicity, or..."

660
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:17,046
He chose that girl
to be his herald.

661
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:17,947
His messenger.
He is doing
the Lord's work.

662
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:23,520
He's killin'
our kids, Joe.

663
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:23,753
My church is
more full than it
has been in years.

664
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:28,925
People are coming to me
asking for redemption,
for salvation.

665
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:32,395
They're scared, Hank.

666
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:34,797
They want to walk
on the righteous
path again.

667
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,401
Now, I want to call
the Mayor.

668
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:41,838
And then I want
to call my lawyer.

669
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,147
Merry Christmas, ma'am.

670
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:51,748
Merry Christmas.

671
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,585
I was wondering
if Jami's around?

672
00:50:58,923 --> 00:50:59,088
He's kidding, right?

673
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,165
I'm sorry about
what I did.

674
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,333
No, I'm sorry.
I can't believe
I made you walk home.

675
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:13,703
I took the bus.

676
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,546
Hey, I wanted to tell you.

677
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:26,549
I found out
Charles Pierce, Jr.
is alive.

678
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,384
He's the son of
the director of
<i>The Town...</i>

679
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:29,953
The Town
 That Dreaded Sundown?

680
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:32,755
Look, I know it's
a long shot, but...

681
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,958
I mean, the movie,
uh, defined Texarkana

682
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:37,760
just as much as
the murders did.

683
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,296
Anyway, he lives here,
in Texarkana.

684
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,432
Near here,
out by the dredge.

685
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:42,865
You talked to him?

686
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:46,269
Uh, no, I've been
asking around about him.

687
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,771
He does odd jobs
for the city, doesn't even
have a cell phone.

688
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,140
But worth a try. Right?

689
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:52,809
If I can get
in touch with him?

690
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,510
Yeah, definitely.

691
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:55,778
Thanks.
All right.

692
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:01,551
This is for you.

693
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:04,754
Nick.

694
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:32,715
Thank you.

695
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:35,084
<i>This one's for all
the brave men and women</i>

696
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:40,123
<i>who are out there
each and every night
patrolling the streets,</i>

697
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:41,524
<i>doing everything
they can...</i>

698
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:44,293
<i>We do not, and I repeat,
 we do not believe</i>

699
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,529
<i>that Reverend Cartwright
 is the Phantom.</i>

700
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,365
<i>We have taken
 Reverend Joseph Cartwright
 into custody...</i>

701
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:50,800
Get me started, Elmer.

702
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,439
Every Christmas,
Ardele.

703
00:52:58,409 --> 00:52:59,442
They don't have you
working tonight?

704
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,646
Well, I just arrested

705
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:06,883
one of Texarkana's

706
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,851
most prominent citizens

707
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:09,318
for sending an e-mail, so...

708
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:12,855
That's enough
for tonight.

709
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:17,960
<i>We do not have
the Phantom in custody.</i>

710
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:20,556
Hank.

711
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:22,859
Hank!

712
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:22,979
Mark it.

713
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,515
Action. Bud.

714
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:37,693
My daddy was
 a genius visionary.

715
00:56:39,263 --> 00:56:41,497
Could have been
the next Orson Welles
if he'd gone to Hollywood,

716
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:42,932
but he wanted to stay in Texas
and tell our stories.

717
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:47,670
You know,
Texas stories.

718
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:48,537
Not all that
Hollywood bullshit.

719
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:52,942
Oh, that. Yeah,
that's pretty cool.

720
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:55,945
Yep. That's the original.

721
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,282
Go ahead and touch it
if you want.

722
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,752
No, thank you, sir.
Go ahead.

723
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:03,586
That's okay. I don't...
I don't want to.

724
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:06,656
Okay.

725
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:11,394
Um... Mr. Pierce,
I'm writing something
about the Phantom,

726
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:17,066
about his legacy
in our town and...

727
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:18,935
Well, I can tell you
who the killer is.

728
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,036
Would that be
interesting to you?

729
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,204
Sure, yeah.

730
00:57:23,307 --> 00:57:25,908
Well, all right.

731
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,643
Well, my father, when
he was doing his research,
he talked to everyone.

732
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:35,084
Most people believe
that Benjamin Sewell
was the Phantom.

733
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:37,153
No, he wasn't.
No, no, no, no.

734
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:38,321
Sewell was not
the killer.

735
00:57:38,322 --> 00:57:40,122
No, they railroaded
that poor son of a bitch.

736
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,058
No, the police just
wanted someone
to be the killer.

737
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:42,892
How do you know
that for sure?

738
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:45,995
How do I know?
I don't know.

739
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:46,896
You can't know.

740
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:50,433
Oh.

741
00:57:52,436 --> 00:57:54,136
You know, I'll tell you
a story that my
father told me

742
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,141
about Hank McCreedy.

743
00:57:59,142 --> 00:57:59,508
Hank McCreedy?

744
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:05,147
A few days after
the last murder
at the Stark farm,

745
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,516
the police on
the Arkansas side,

746
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:11,020
they found a body
all in pieces.

747
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:13,522
It'd been run over
by a train.

748
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:17,493
Now, this is
the Arkansas police

749
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,328
who say,
"Oh, it's the Phantom.

750
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,796
"He committed suicide."

751
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:22,431
No more Phantom.

752
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:23,532
Based on what?

753
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:26,369
Nothin'.
It was based on nothin'.

754
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:29,939
But Hank McCreedy's
pregnant wife,

755
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,874
she demands
an autopsy.

756
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:34,176
And then it come out.
He wasn't run over.

757
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,846
He was stabbed
more than two dozen times,

758
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,214
right next to
the tracks.

759
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:39,715
My daddy, he had
a theory about that.

760
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:46,856
He said that the Phantom
killed McCreedy,

761
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:48,391
you know, his last victim,
his final goodbye.

762
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,228
And then he hopped
a train to California.

763
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:58,367
Mr. Pierce, I've read
everything there is
to read on this.

764
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,403
I've never even heard
of this Hank McCreedy.

765
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:01,904
It should have been
front-page news.

766
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:05,708
But while the Arkansas
police were findin' McCreedy,

767
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:09,412
the Texas police,
they were arresting Sewell

768
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:11,247
and so you got
two different camps

769
00:59:11,248 --> 00:59:12,515
each saying
they got the Phantom.

770
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:14,917
And what neither of them
is piecing together is that

771
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:17,887
Sewell was in custody
when McCreedy was killed,

772
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,622
proving that neither
one was the Phantom.

773
00:59:19,623 --> 00:59:20,689
So Sewell was in jail,

774
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:25,661
and then, did anything
ever come from McCreedy?

775
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:27,229
Oh, he's dead.

776
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,531
Yep, and dead men
don't complain much.

777
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,234
But his pregnant
wife, Mary,

778
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,436
she's pissed as shit.

779
00:59:33,437 --> 00:59:34,770
Her name was Mary?

780
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:37,573
My daddy tracked
her down in 1974.

781
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,942
And, oh, she was
still bitter.

782
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:42,111
She said that Texarkana

783
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:44,213
had done worse than
killed her husband.

784
00:59:44,214 --> 00:59:46,082
It had shat
on his memory.

785
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,717
And in the process, it was
shitting on her life.

786
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:50,453
It was shitting on
her son's life.

787
00:59:50,454 --> 00:59:53,255
Who you think
is the Phantom?

788
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:53,422
No! No!

789
00:59:54,858 --> 00:59:56,592
Sorry.

790
00:59:57,661 --> 00:59:58,694
Hank McCreedy's dead.

791
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:03,199
His son is dead.
His grandson

792
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:03,632
is still alive.

793
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:07,369
That's your Phantom,
right there.

794
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,471
You're making
this shit up.

795
01:00:08,472 --> 01:00:10,139
No! Boy, listen to me.

796
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:13,275
I am telling you what
I know to be true.

797
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,645
That Mary McCreedy
did pour poison
about Texarkana

798
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,247
into Hank Jr.'s ear.

799
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:20,116
Hank did the same
thing to his son!

800
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,951
They did, consciously
or unconsciously,

801
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,886
they bred themselves
a killer!

802
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:25,287
Mr. Pierce,
do you have any proof
of this being true,

803
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:31,560
or is this just something
that your father told you?

804
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,040
My daddy asked me to make
a sequel to <i>Town,</i>

805
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:48,644
to finish the story
he started

806
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:52,414
and to set the record straight
about the McCreedys.

807
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:58,420
He was my best friend.

808
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,824
Now he's deceased.

809
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,632
I tracked down
Mary McCreedy in 1986.

810
01:01:09,633 --> 01:01:12,101
I found that
scary old bitch
on her deathbed,

811
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:12,768
and she warned me.

812
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:15,037
She said that her
grandson would do

813
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:20,009
what her son didn't have
the balls to do.

814
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:20,676
Make Texarkana
pay for its sins.

815
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:27,049
Yeah. And no one else
has thought of this?

816
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,054
Not like the police,
or the FBI,

817
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:34,356
or the goddamn fucking
Texas Rangers?

818
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,891
Do you believe
his story?

819
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,393
Are you kidding me?
The man lives on a boat.

820
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:41,497
Wait, do you
believe him?

821
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,034
I don't know.

822
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:48,137
Hey, I'm just saying,

823
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:52,174
if McCreedy did
have a grandson,

824
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:52,408
he'd probably be in
his 20s or his 30s,
at least. Nick.

825
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:57,213
Come on.

826
01:02:12,596 --> 01:02:16,232
As far as we know, fucking
Charles B. Pierce, Jr.
could be the killer.

827
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,933
He doesn't have
a reason to be.

828
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:21,103
His story was told,
his father's story
was told.

829
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:22,538
Yeah, up until the sequel.

830
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:24,206
But they're a part
of the legend.

831
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,041
They're in the movie.
They're there somewhere.

832
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:27,176
All of them except for...

833
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:28,844
McCreedy.

834
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:31,747
Now, his name
wasn't even mentioned
in the papers.

835
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,716
He doesn't have
a plaque anywhere.

836
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:36,552
He's not even in
the movie that they
show every damn year.

837
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:38,787
It's...
It'd be upsetting.

838
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,522
It's an injustice, Nick.

839
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:43,959
Hank McCreedy's grandson would
see it as an injustice.

840
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,635
<i>Now, this is a very sad day</i>

841
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:53,269
<i>for us all.</i>

842
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:58,140
<i>It always is when you lose
 an officer of the law</i>

843
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:00,209
<i>in the line of duty.</i>

844
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:03,812
<i>Now, I did not work with
Deputy Tillman long,</i>

845
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:06,815
<i>but you all know him
 a lot better than...

846
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:09,151
How many of these
have you gotten?

847
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:11,787
This is the second
notice of acceptance.

848
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,455
Grandma, I just
met somebody
and I think I might...

849
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,791
I am not gonna let this mess

850
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,893
be the most important
thing in your life.

851
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:18,794
Grandma, it already is.

852
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,831
I have talked to your
uncle in California

853
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:23,232
and he said that we can stay
with him as long as need be.

854
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:26,468
Pack up.

855
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:28,637
We'll leave
before daybreak.

856
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,946
Tomorrow for sure?

857
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:13,048
I'm already packed.

858
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:15,851
You couldn't
wait a day?

859
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,737
I'm not gonna see you.

860
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:35,170
I hate that.

861
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,741
I could come visit,
though.

862
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,579
Yeah, of course.

863
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,141
Are you okay?

864
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:49,077
Yeah.

865
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:18,527
Grandma.
I'll just be a second.
Okay.

866
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,399
So, I'm not sure
if anyone told you,

867
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,435
but my grandma
and I are gonna take off
for a little while.

868
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:27,135
Yeah, she mentioned that.

869
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:29,805
Can I show
you something?

870
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:34,710
It could be nothing,
but I just think it should be
investigated by someone.

871
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:42,284
Who's he?
His name's
Hank McCreedy.

872
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,486
He was the original
Phantom's last victim

873
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:46,588
but he's sort of
forgotten about.

874
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,256
I heard a story
about him, so I did
some research,

875
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:50,325
and he's got a grandson
somewhere.

876
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:52,160
I've been writing
an article.

877
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:53,395
I'm gonna try
and finish it

878
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:54,930
when I get
to California.

879
01:08:54,931 --> 01:08:57,232
I'll look into it
for you, I promise.

880
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:59,568
Jami. Come on, hon.

881
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,339
Drive safe.

882
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:29,831
Never left Texas
my whole life.

883
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,301
Isn't that somethin'?

884
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:58,360
Do you want
anything else?
Just a coffee?

885
01:09:58,361 --> 01:09:59,828
Mmm... A Danish.

886
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:01,863
And, uh, get some water.

887
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:15,577
Good morning.
 It's New Year's Day
 here at KYGL,

888
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:18,246
<i>and for you early birds,
here's a classic.</i>

889
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,608
Grandma?

890
01:11:21,177 --> 01:11:23,245
Grandma.

891
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,756
Grandma, no!

892
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:37,325
No...  No!

893
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:39,995
Don't...

894
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:43,498
Help me, please,
somebody!

895
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,805
The Phantom, he's...

896
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:06,207
Like a dog with a bone,
ain't ya?

897
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:58,093
What?

898
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:15,276
Oh, my God.

899
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:15,443
Oh, God, oh, God.
Oh, no, no!

900
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,221
The fuck...

901
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,238
Foster.

902
01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:51,646
Go on, show her, boy.

903
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:58,219
No!

904
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,287
Hey, Jami.

905
01:15:59,288 --> 01:15:59,687
No!

906
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:01,923
No!

907
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:04,259
No! I saw him die!

908
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,264
I watched you die!
Shh!

909
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:10,565
I know...
If you remember,

910
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,901
you actually missed
most of it.

911
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:15,770
They found his body.
They found his body.

912
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:17,672
No, I found his body.

913
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:18,773
Was a poor runaway kid.

914
01:16:20,943 --> 01:16:24,279
Cut up his face,
knocked out his teeth,
left two of mine.

915
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:28,249
Are you Hank McCreedy's
grandson?

916
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:29,918
One of you is
Hank McCreedy's grandson.

917
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:30,218
I am.

918
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:32,921
And now, thanks to you,

919
01:16:35,858 --> 01:16:37,692
they're gonna remember
my granddaddy.

920
01:16:39,495 --> 01:16:41,196
Corey.

921
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:46,234
All those people died.
My grandma.
Why did you do it?

922
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:49,637
Born in Texarkana,

923
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:52,273
buried in Texarkana.

924
01:16:57,546 --> 01:16:59,514
Well, not me,
God damn it.

925
01:16:59,515 --> 01:17:00,982
But I knew we were
the same, you and me.

926
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:04,886
Both of us trapped.
No.

927
01:17:04,887 --> 01:17:05,487
We are not the same.

928
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,724
Didn't this town
decide who you were?

929
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:13,128
The crazy girl, with the...
The dead parents?

930
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:15,964
Oh, it was
the same with me.

931
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:19,234
I was the golden boy.
A football star.

932
01:17:19,235 --> 01:17:21,469
I'd go to college
like my dad

933
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,571
and I'd come back
like my dad.

934
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:24,139
Well, fuck that!

935
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:26,174
I wanted to be a part of
something special.

936
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,078
I wanted to be
remembered!

937
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:31,679
Like the Phantom.

938
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,482
When people talk about
what happened in Texarkana,

939
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,951
about how the Phantom
came back,

940
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:38,686
oh, I'll know!

941
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,256
I'll know that I,
I made that...

942
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:45,493
They're gonna keep
looking for you.

943
01:17:47,196 --> 01:17:48,830
They're gonna keep
looking for the...
Jami!

944
01:17:56,105 --> 01:17:57,639
Why would they?

945
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:00,275
No!

946
01:18:00,276 --> 01:18:02,277
When I tell 'em

947
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:04,612
that I caught
the two kids who did it.

948
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:05,280
Who were so obsessed

949
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:07,882
with the Phantom,

950
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:09,851
that one faked
his own death.

951
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:10,552
She killed her
own grandma.

952
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:13,788
No! No, fuck you!
And you know what?

953
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:14,722
They'll believe me.

954
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,226
Only because

955
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:19,994
everybody in this town

956
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:23,932
just wants to believe
this whole thing is over.

957
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:44,219
It is over.

958
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:14,449
This story
 is about Texarkana.

959
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:16,851
<i>A town that is
 really two towns.</i>

960
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:18,920
<i>Two sheriffs. Two mayors.</i>

961
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:21,122
<i>And in the end,
two Phantoms.</i>

962
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:22,624
<i>After I came out of the
 Redwater Bayous that night,</i>

963
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,595
<i>Ranger Morales
 and his men went back in.</i>

964
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,597
<i>They wanted to close
 the most terrible chapter
 in our town's history.</i>

965
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,735
<i>Some people say the swamp
 took Deputy Foster,</i>

966
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:39,607
<i>that the swamp gave him
 the only burial he deserved.</i>

967
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,276
<i>Others believed I hadn't
killed the Phantom</i>

968
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:43,578
<i>'cause he was something
that couldn't be killed.</i>

969
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:45,747
<i>A demon or a spirit.</i>

970
01:19:45,748 --> 01:19:47,882
<i>People believe what
 they need to believe.</i>

971
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:50,818
<i>They make up whatever
 story they need to
 keep living sanely.</i>

972
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:52,253
<i>Well, I did the</i> Bootleggers,

973
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:53,588
<i>and</i> The Legend
of Boggy Creek

974
01:19:53,589 --> 01:19:55,456
<i>and this is my third one,
</i> Winterhawk.

975
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:58,259
The hardest thing
 for my town has been
 the wrestling to understand

976
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,595
<i>how Clayborn Foster
 and Corey found each other</i>

977
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:02,030
<i>and put on those masks</i>

978
01:20:02,031 --> 01:20:02,830
<i>and did those inhuman things.</i>

979
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:09,103
<i>Their lives were
 investigated and there was
 nothing linking them.</i>

980
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:12,940
<i>They had nothing in common
 except the darkness
 in their souls.</i>

981
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:14,075
<i>And I swear, that will
 keep the Phantom alive
 as much as anything else.</i>

982
01:20:16,245 --> 01:20:17,445
<i>As for me,</i>

983
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,215
<i>I did what my grandma
 always wanted.</i>

984
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:22,350
<i>I left Texas.
 I moved away.</i>

985
01:20:25,688 --> 01:20:26,921
<i>To a new life,</i>

986
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:29,290
<i>to a place where no one
knows who I am,
or what I survived.</i>

987
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:33,261
<i>Where I'm the only
 person that knows</i>

988
01:20:34,697 --> 01:20:36,631
<i>that as quickly
 and as senselessly</i>

989
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:39,834
<i>as death came to
 Texarkana in 1946,</i>

990
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,103
<i>and then again
late last year,</i>

991
01:20:42,104 --> 01:20:42,837
<i>it could come back</i>

992
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:46,874
<i>the next time
 the sun goes down.</i>
