00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,226
* (Music playing)

2
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,415
* (Radio playing)

3
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:06,800
(Horn honking)

4
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,569
What the fuck?

5
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:14,275
(Mumbling)

6
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:25,553
- (Insects chirping)
- (Wolf howls)

7
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,658
(Mumbling)

8
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,293
Better than the radio.
(Laughing)

9
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,567
Hey, lady, you need a ride?

10
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:41,502
Come on.

11
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,808
Hey, Jesus, girl.

12
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:50,878
You all right?

13
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:53,514
You're all wet.

14
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,319
Where you going?

15
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:06,594
Er, yeah, okay, me too, me too.

16
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,636
(Baby murmuring)

17
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:16,770
You got a baby there?

18
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,439
Is it a boy or a girl?

19
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:25,145
Nice, I guess you're not
really the talkative type, huh?

20
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:27,315
It's okay, let me put
on some tunes, huh?

21
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:31,952
(Tuning radio)

22
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,687
What's wrong with the radio?

23
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:35,823
(Turns radio off)

24
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,361
Looks like... Whoa, looks like
there's an accident up ahead.

25
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:47,635
Wait here, I gotta see
if everybody's okay.

26
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,906
God, looks like...
This looks bad.

27
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,775
(Squelching)

28
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:09,790
Hey, hello?

29
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,766
Aw, man. Hey, hello?

30
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,403
Hey, you okay?

31
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:23,871
Miss?

32
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:25,406
(Under his breath)
Shit.

33
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:28,609
Hey, miss, you okay? Miss?

34
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,544
Oh, God.

35
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,382
(Baby groaning)

36
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:40,488
(Baby screaming)

37
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,294
(Tires screeching)

38
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,674
(Police radio chattering)

39
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:09,450
What do we got?

40
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,687
Well, we got three dead.

41
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:17,425
Looks like car one
side-swiped car two.

42
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,627
Car two hits the pole,

43
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,862
Sends this woman out the window,

44
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,464
Baby follows.

45
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,699
Baby? Jesus.

46
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:27,968
Yeah and the weird thing is,

47
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,971
Car one guy actually
seems to have gone off

48
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,441
And then come back
a little bit later.

49
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,609
Hope it wasn't to apologize.

50
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:39,313
So he finds her and then
gets hit by a third car.

51
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:41,949
Police Officer:
We got a lead on that?

52
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,775
(Dog barking)

53
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:10,444
- (Keys jingling)
- (Sarah sighs)

54
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,780
Sarah: I can never
remember which one it is.

55
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:16,083
Chad: You must be in
charge of a lot of doors.

56
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:20,754
Sarah: (Laughing)
Yeah. Ah, here we go.

57
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:21,789
Chad: Finally.

58
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,891
(Door unlocking and opening)

59
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,961
(Slamming)

60
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,902
(Sighs)
Okay.

61
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,073
Sarah: Sorry we had
to use the back door.

62
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:43,677
The only one that
hasn't been condemned.

63
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,479
That's okay.

64
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,815
I'm just glad you could
show me the place.

65
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,688
Well, follow me.

66
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,459
Watch your step there, please.

67
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,469
(Rat squeaking)

68
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:09,670
Sarah: We'll just continue
through here.

69
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,771
Chad: Okay.

70
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,709
Okay, so this is it.

71
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,513
The crown-jewel
of Wayville Hill.

72
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:24,051
Erm, built in 1827.

73
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:29,890
Just five years before the
cholera epidemic of 1832.

74
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,760
- (Slamming)
- It's charming.

75
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:37,030
Yeah. So, of course,
the power is off.

76
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,767
So is the heat.

77
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:42,970
The city just can't afford
to keep the boilers running.

78
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,105
But we can turn that
all back on for you,

79
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,107
If you choose to use
this in your movie.

80
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,442
Yeah, no worries.

81
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,511
I like it just the way it is.

82
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,145
Good.

83
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,015
Okay, well we should get going.

84
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,050
If you'll just come with me.

85
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:05,092
Each nurse would be in charge
of one floor to herself.

86
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,660
She'd have one or two people

87
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,562
Below her to help out.

88
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:09,997
But that way, it kept things

89
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,165
Nice and consistent
for everyone.

90
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,102
Chad: This place is huge.

91
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:19,740
Sarah: Yeah, three
wards, 500,000 square feet.

92
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:24,144
And enough equipment to treat
hundreds of sick patients.

93
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,580
Chad: It doesn't
look that old,

94
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,115
For something built
almost 200 years ago.

95
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,984
Sarah: Well, the
building has gradually

96
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,986
Been renovated over the years.

97
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,956
I mean up until the county
closed it, 32 years ago.

98
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,058
We're gonna go in here.

99
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:42,963
And what happened here?

100
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:48,936
Nothing you didn't show in
your movies, Mr. Winchester.

101
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,539
Chad: Oh, so you're
familiar with my work?

102
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,841
Yeah, a little bit.

103
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,944
Got guts.
(Chuckles)

104
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,948
(Slamming)

105
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,121
Sarah: You know,
this institution

106
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,222
Helped a lot of people.

107
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,693
Chad: I heard they weren't
always that helpful here.

108
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,963
Sarah: Yeah, well it's like
my dad used to always say,

109
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,899
"You can't make an omelet
without cracking a few eggs."

110
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,168
Chad: Yeah, I guess.

111
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,121
Oh, yeah!

112
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,291
Welcome to the asylum.

113
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,661
I'm just gonna get some
video footage here, okay?

114
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:48,729
Sarah: Yeah. Yeah.

115
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,866
Chad: Okay, let's do this.

116
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,606
Hello to my future self,

117
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,841
To the producers
watching this with me.

118
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:01,842
Hello.

119
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,711
Oh, hi, Mom.

120
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:04,778
(Chuckles)

121
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,181
I'm standing in one of
the freakiest places

122
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,618
I've seen in a very long time.

123
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,854
Wayville Hill Sanitarium,
West Virginia.

124
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:21,995
Well, fortunately not everything
is so depressing down here.

125
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,631
(Laughing)

126
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,033
Hey, it's Grandma's upholstery.

127
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,137
So according to a friend
of a friend of mine,

128
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,238
Who lives in the county,

129
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,974
Wayville Hill Sanitarium
became infamous

130
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:37,344
For its atrocious experiments
conducted on the patients,

131
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:41,815
Between around 1925 to 1928.

132
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,986
The most popular case is
the one of a Mary Weaver.

133
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,255
It's even said that Mary's ghost

134
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,758
Still roams these corridors
searching for something.

135
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,225
(Laughing)
Classic.

136
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,094
Here she is.

137
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,666
Sarah: Come
on, it's this way.

138
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:05,773
So, according to the
medical archives,

139
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:09,777
Mary was in room 502,

140
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:16,116
Which should be at the
end of this corridor.

141
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,654
Ah, here it is.

142
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,923
Oh, this is great.

143
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,758
(Laughing)
Oh, wow!

144
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,626
Oh, my God.

145
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,261
Even the cheesiest horror flick

146
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,197
Wouldn't have
something this obvious.

147
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:33,867
Oh, this is good stuff.

148
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,303
Did you do this for me?

149
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,105
Sarah: Don't
flatter yourself.

150
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,873
Chad: Here, give
me a hand with this.

151
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:40,941
Sarah: Okay.

152
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:48,749
(Eerie breathing)

153
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,919
(Bumping)

154
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,657
Well, that sucks.

155
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,094
Well, I don't know
what you were hoping for.

156
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,331
I don't know,
something sexier.

157
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,272
Can you introduce
yourself to the camera?

158
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,877
Hi, I'm Sarah Davis.

159
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,113
I work for the county of
Tucker, West Virginia.

160
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,750
Chad: Tell us where we are.

161
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:27,788
We are in room 502 of
Wayville Hill Sanitarium.

162
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,157
Chad: Can you explain
to the people watching this

163
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,726
Why I so very badly
wanted to come here?

164
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,996
Because of the
story of Mary Weaver.

165
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,265
Chad: And what is that?

166
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:44,071
Back in 1927, the body
of nurse Mary Weaver

167
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:47,007
Was found dead in this room,

168
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,342
Laying in a pool
of her own blood.

169
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,012
It's said that she
committed suicide

170
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,814
After a psychotic breakdown,

171
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,283
Following the
murder of her baby.

172
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,152
After she became pregnant,

173
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:02,089
She was admitted to this
hospital for anxiety.

174
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:06,059
The doctor in charge believed
her unborn baby was the devil.

175
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,295
So immediately
upon giving birth,

176
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,299
He slit the baby's throat
as she watched helplessly.

177
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:18,271
He didn't even bother to cut
the umbilical cord first.

178
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,442
She completely lost it,

179
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,146
And was locked in this
room, to rot and die.

180
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,517
It's said that she just
rocked back and forth,

181
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,153
Begging for them to
give her baby back.

182
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:37,424
One night, she managed
to break the window,

183
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,426
And using a shard of glass,

184
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,395
She disemboweled
herself completely.

185
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,498
Chad: Cut.

186
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,168
Damn, you're good.

187
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,403
That was good.

188
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,840
What about the other rooms?

189
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:57,410
Erm, yes, well, the infirmary
is down the hall.

190
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,511
I'm in.

191
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,123
(Eerie breathing)

192
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:13,193
Chad: So, is it true that
if you listen closely,

193
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:16,196
Sometimes you can hear her
hum songs to her dead kid?

194
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,031
(Laughs nervously)

195
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,366
Sarah: Well,
yeah, that's part of

196
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,001
The folklore of this place.

197
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,137
But mainly it's
just scary stories,

198
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,839
Told to frighten little kids.

199
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,908
Chad: Well, that's a shame.

200
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,242
Maybe if we're lucky,

201
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,844
We'll get a chance
to hear something.

202
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,983
(Chad humming)

203
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:38,185
Mary? Mary?

204
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:42,022
Oh, look at that.

205
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,424
That's a creepy shot.

206
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:58,071
(Chad humming)

207
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:05,245
Mary: (Whispering)
Sarah.

208
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,981
Chad: Hey,
I think I found it.

209
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,016
(Gasping)
God!

210
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,350
Chad: (Laughing)
What?

211
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,186
Come on. Follow me.

212
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:15,455
Sarah: Okay.

213
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:26,533
(Wheelchair squeaking)

214
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,972
- (Rats squeaking)
- (Dripping)

215
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,249
Chad: Now this
is more like it.

216
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,031
Do you think this is where
the doctor killed that baby?

217
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,102
Sarah: Maybe.

218
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,104
If I remember correctly,

219
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:05,372
This is the only place
in the sanitarium

220
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,074
Where a woman could give birth.

221
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,178
You know a lot
about this place, huh?

222
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,249
Yeah, my father used to bring
me here a lot, as a child.

223
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,219
You know,
before they closed it down.

224
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,355
Really? He worked here?

225
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,359
Like his father and
grandfather before him.

226
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,696
I am the only one
that didn't go...

227
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,664
(Glass crunching)

228
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,101
Into medicine.

229
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,971
So, would your
great grandfather

230
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,539
Have been here during
the Mary events?

231
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,510
Sarah: Yeah, I guess.

232
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,614
I've never really
given it much thought.

233
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,057
That's my great grandfather.

234
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:03,997
It looks like he's the only
doctor in all these photos.

235
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,167
Yeah, that's because
he was the only doctor.

236
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,369
The county couldn't
afford any more.

237
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,340
Shit.

238
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,709
So the doctor that killed
Mary's baby would have been...

239
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,546
My great grandfather.

240
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:23,683
(Screaming)

241
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:30,590
(Eerie breathing)

242
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,260
That was not a hum.

243
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,428
What the fuck?
That was not a fucking hum!

244
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,197
We need to leave.
We need to leave, now!

245
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,532
(Slamming)

246
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,170
What the fuck was that?

247
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,305
Who's there?

248
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,710
(Eerie whispering)

249
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,345
I said who's there!

250
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,148
Oh, shit.

251
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,788
Mary: (Whispering)
My baby.

252
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,590
Chad: You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

253
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,396
(Screaming)

254
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,499
Fuck, come on.
Why won't this open?

255
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,034
(Growling)

256
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:21,174
Mary: (Whispering)
Sarah.

257
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:22,775
- (Growling)
- (Gasps)

258
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:38,858
(Mary whispering)

259
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,428
No, what do you want from me?

260
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,298
(Crying)
Leave me alone.

261
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:04,151
* (Tinkling music plays)

262
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:25,638
(Mary humming)

263
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,715
(Eerie breathing)

264
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:52,565
(Whispering)
Give me back my baby.

265
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:06,846
(Dripping)

266
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,484
Sarah: Chad? Chad?

267
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,653
(Whimpers)

268
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,489
(Crying)
Oh, my God.

269
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,526
Mary: (Whispering)
Sarah.

270
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:25,498
My baby.

271
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,870
Sarah.

272
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,641
(Sarah screaming)

273
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,520
Mary: (Whispering)
My baby.

274
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,925
My baby.

275
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,194
Sarah.

276
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,764
(Sarah screaming)

277
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:01,234
Give me back my baby.

278
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,538
(Mary humming)

279
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:43,576
I want my baby.

280
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:49,316
(Yelling)
Give me back my baby!

281
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,983
(Slamming)

282
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,688
(Gurgling)

283
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:04,464
(Screaming)

284
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:24,984
Man: I don't
like this, Erin.

285
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,319
I'm coming home.

286
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,054
Erin: I'm fine.

287
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,723
We knew this was gonna
happen sooner or later.

288
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:31,791
It's fine.

289
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:33,693
I mean, even if you
rented a car and drove,

290
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,862
You wouldn't be here
until tomorrow morning.

291
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,799
Man: Let me call
Kelly, she'll at least...

292
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,534
I don't need a babysitter.

293
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:43,503
I'm fine.

294
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:49,909
Look, I haven't heard
from them in a long time.

295
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,011
I'm sure there not
just gonna suddenly

296
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,013
Show up because you're not here.

297
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,484
I'm safe.

298
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:02,689
I'm inside. I'll just lock
the doors and be just fine.

299
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,394
Man: Will you promise
me you'll take at least one?

300
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,332
Yes.

301
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:27,514

TV: Tell me I'm
stupid and pathetic

306
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,577
And just leave me alone.

307
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,517
TV: They've
investigated my mother.

308
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,219
Thank God she's dead.

309
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:52,725
TV: Those are really...

310
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,027

You know they can't help you.

Hello, is anybody there?

Do you miss us?

Why can't you
just leave me alone?

always needed us.

only be described as

A crime of passion and jealousy.

00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:24,850
With information
on his whereabouts

363
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:27,185
To please call
Crime Stoppers at...

364
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:29,621
Hello?

365
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:31,557
(Knocking at door)

366
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,658
No, thank you.

367
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:36,962
(Knocking at door)

368
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:38,897
I said, no, thank you.

369
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:09,695
(Police siren)

370
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:16,302
Cop: Get down on the ground!

371
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:17,436
Now! Get down!

372
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:21,673
(Yelling)

373
00:37:39,325 --> 00:37:40,326
(Knocking)

374
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:41,960
Philip: Shit.

375
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:44,563
Who is it?

376
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,771
I told you I didn't
want room service.

377
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,806
All right? The sign
says do not disturb.

378
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,542
Do you speak English?

379
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,878
I'm trying to get
some sleep in here.

380
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,124
Clerk: Front desk.

381
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,393
Yeah, I wanna
make a complaint.

382
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,628
Clerk: Okay, sir,
what's your concern?

383
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,897
My concern is your housekeeper
keeps knocking on my door.

384
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,632
All right? I told you
not to send anyone.

385
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,333
I am trying to sleep.

386
00:38:56,702 --> 00:38:57,869
Clerk: Sir, all the housekeepers
left a few minutes ago.

387
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,771
It's probably just a kid from

388
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:01,573
One of the rooms next to yours.

389
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,075
There's a policeman on-site,
I could send him over?

390
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,813
No, no. Look, it's fine.

391
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,983
Thanks. Look, I just
wanna get some rest.

392
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,520
Clerk: All right,
good night, sir.

393
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:21,993
(Knocking)

394
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:34,773
Philip: Hello?

395
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,509
Who is it?

396
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,619
Please, please leave me alone.

397
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:50,889
I just wanna be left alone.

398
00:39:58,897 --> 00:39:59,931
No way.

399
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,868
I'm not in the mood for tricks.

400
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:22,247
Who are you?

401
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:37,763
I couldn't control myself,
all right?

402
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,233
There's nothing good
about what I do.

403
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:47,105
I do it because I have to.

404
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:53,945
It was you.

405
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:57,849
You must have killed the others.

406
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,719
The police said there were 12.

407
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,521
I only killed seven.

408
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:08,126
You're just a copycat.

409
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:11,897
Trying to take
credit for my work.

410
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:17,002
I don't take
pleasure in killing.

411
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:22,007
I just let things
get out of hand.

412
00:42:28,013 --> 00:42:29,981
I bet you do it for
enjoyment, don't you?

413
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:37,623
All right, if you must know.

414
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:41,226
I do enjoy it a little.

415
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:45,563
Not as much as you, I bet.

416
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:47,165
Not even close.

417
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,321
Who are you?
How do you know me?

418
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:11,890
Just leave me alone!

419
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:13,825
(Knocking at door)

420
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:15,026
(Gunshots)

421
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,361
(Thudding)

422
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:27,272
Shit.

423
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:55,834
(Phone ringing)

424
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,972
(Phone ringing)

425
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:05,844
(Phone ringing)

426
00:44:08,914 --> 00:44:10,081
Hello?

427
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:13,251
(Eerie whispering)

428
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:14,720
What are you?

429
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:17,723
(Eerie whispering)

430
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:19,925
I understand imitation's the
greatest form of flattery,

431
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:22,460
But why are you helping me?

432
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:27,699
(Eerie whispering)

433
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:30,201
Coming for me?

434
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:31,737
(Police siren)

435
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,006
Where do you come from?

436
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:37,042
(Eerie whispering)

437
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:38,076
What?

438
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:39,911
(Eerie whispering)

439
00:44:39,945 --> 00:44:41,246
Join you? I don't understand.

440
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:42,480
How? Where?

441
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,850
(Eerie whispering)

442
00:44:44,883 --> 00:44:49,888
(Clanking)

443
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,930
Is this where you come from?

444
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,045
Partners.

445
00:45:48,814 --> 00:45:51,016
(Distant yelling)

446
00:46:23,481 --> 00:46:26,117
(Clanking)

447
00:46:57,582 --> 00:46:59,550
* Won't live a lie

448
00:46:59,584 --> 00:47:04,055
* And refuse to accept it

449
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:09,961
* Can't move
can't feel nothing *

450
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:12,330
* But the weight of the world

451
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:15,566
* I'm glued to this scene

452
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:20,038
* Can you take back

453
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:25,076
* All of the time you
didn't know you lost *

454
00:47:25,911 --> 00:47:28,914
* Would you give back

455
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:34,419
* For one more chance
to take a chance *

456
00:47:41,259 --> 00:47:45,897
* Don't worry, don't worry

457
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:51,236
* I'll be just fine

458
00:47:51,937 --> 00:47:53,304
Hey, wait,
turn it down, turn it down

459
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:55,206
It's coming up here.
On the right.

460
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,207
Oh, hey, let me guess.

461
00:47:56,241 --> 00:47:57,275
Is it after a tree?

462
00:47:57,308 --> 00:47:59,344
My god, what are you five?

463
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:00,578
Yeah.

464
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,648
So, Carissa,
pretty cool of your parents

465
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:05,316
To let us use the
camp for the weekend.

466
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:07,252
Yeah.

467
00:48:08,186 --> 00:48:10,555
Jess: Did you come
up here a lot as a kid?

468
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:13,358
No, not really.

469
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:15,626
Not since my parents
got a divorce.

470
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:18,229
I'm sorry.

471
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:22,233
(Giggling)

472
00:48:25,971 --> 00:48:27,605
Who's ready for an
awesome weekend, huh?

473
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,174
(Laughing)
Hell yeah, woo!

474
00:48:29,207 --> 00:48:34,079
(Music blaring)

475
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:48,994
* Don't worry, don't worry

476
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,999
* I'll be just fine

477
00:49:02,007 --> 00:49:03,174
Jess: You ready to go in?

478
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:04,509
Yes.

479
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,111
Yes, yes I am.

480
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:23,361
Derek: Amazing, it's incredible!

481
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:27,098
Tristan: Yeah, don't worry.

482
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:28,233
We'll take your stuff.

483
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:29,467
- Derek: Thank you!
- Tristan: Yep.

484
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:30,968
- (Jess screaming)
- Derek: The orange bag.

485
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:32,503
- Come on!
- (Splashing)

486
00:49:32,537 --> 00:49:33,204
- Jess: Oh, my God!
- (Splashing)

487
00:49:33,238 --> 00:49:34,705
Derek: Feels good, right?

488
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:37,575
Jess: Oh, my God!

489
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:40,278
- Oh my god it's...
- (Screaming and splashing)

490
00:49:53,058 --> 00:49:54,059
Your pill.

491
00:49:59,264 --> 00:50:00,398
There.

492
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:05,336
Does it feel good to be back?

493
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:09,074
Talking about the
cabin or in general?

494
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:11,476
Both, I guess.

495
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:14,312
I guess I'm not sure.

496
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,148
Do you want to talk about it?

497
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:18,649
What's there to talk about?

498
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,354
Look, I'm sorry.

499
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:28,359
I just guess I don't know
how to talk about it yet.

500
00:50:29,294 --> 00:50:30,795
I don't know how
I feel, you know?

501
00:50:32,197 --> 00:50:33,831
I want to have a
good time, really.

502
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,466
That's the point, right?

503
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:42,173
Listen, maybe
we shouldn't have

504
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:43,208
Come up here so soon after...

505
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:45,143
No, it'll be great.

506
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:47,545
I'll adjust, okay?

507
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:51,616
Thank you.

508
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:56,454
For what?

509
00:50:57,322 --> 00:50:58,423
For being you.

510
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,458
For loving me.

511
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:05,130
Now let's have a good time.

512
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:07,665
I'll be fine, I promise.

513
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:19,210
Last one in
the water's a rotten egg.

514
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:25,150
- It's cold, oh, my God.
- It's beautiful.

515
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,751
- (Yelling)
- (Laughing)

516
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,221
- (Splashing)
- (Laughing)

517
00:51:30,255 --> 00:51:32,089
- Don't, don't, don't, don't.
- Come on, come on.

518
00:51:33,158 --> 00:51:34,192
(Screaming)

519
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,303
(Scratching)

520
00:51:47,272 --> 00:51:49,707
(Scratching)

521
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,844
(Scratching)

522
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:22,440
(Vomiting)

523
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:27,378
(Toilet flushing)

524
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:32,917
(Footsteps)

525
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:52,670
(Scratching)

526
00:52:55,005 --> 00:53:00,211
(Scratching)

527
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:08,386
(Scratching)

528
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:17,928
Derek: I'll be
right back, guys.

529
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:29,440
(Scratching)

530
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:42,587
(Banging)

531
00:53:44,422 --> 00:53:46,223
Hey. Scare you?

532
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,259
No. Towel?

533
00:53:48,293 --> 00:53:49,527
Yes, please.

534
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:51,262
Thank you.

535
00:53:57,902 --> 00:53:59,003
You look tired.

536
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:02,239
I didn't get much sleep.

537
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:05,943
A lot on your mind?

538
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:10,681
There was something
in the walls last night.

539
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:12,016
It was scratching.

540
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:14,652
Raccoon?

541
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,021
I'm not sure. Maybe.

542
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:19,957
No one's really been up
here to care for the place.

543
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:22,327
Well, you want
me to take a look?

544
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,961
Sure.

545
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:25,496
Where'd you hear it?

546
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:26,797
Carissa: It's in the bedroom.

547
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:27,832
Okay.

548
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:44,281
(Knocking)

549
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:57,862
Well, I don't see anything.

550
00:54:59,564 --> 00:55:00,731
You didn't hear anything?

551
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:04,835
No. You have a ladder?

552
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:05,970
Maybe it's in the attic.

553
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:07,372
Yeah.

554
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:21,752
Derek: So it's like,
it folds out, right?

555
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:23,921
How does it...?

556
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:25,923
(Laughing)

557
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,057
Well,
there's your problem, Riss.

558
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:28,426
Isn't that a bat house?

559
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,595
How long has that been there?

560
00:55:32,397 --> 00:55:33,398
You okay?

561
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:36,534
What?

562
00:55:37,702 --> 00:55:38,302
Carissa: Don't you
think they're, kind of,

563
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,404
All over each other?

564
00:55:40,405 --> 00:55:42,507
Are you kidding?
It'd be the same if it was us.

565
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:44,975
That doesn't make you worry?

566
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:48,913
Riss, okay...

567
00:55:50,915 --> 00:55:53,518
Look, I know you've been
kind of messed up lately,

568
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:55,119
Dealing with a lot of stuff.

569
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,422
But that...

570
00:55:59,424 --> 00:56:00,958
That guy, there...

571
00:56:02,427 --> 00:56:06,363
That is something you don't
have to worry about, okay?

572
00:56:07,131 --> 00:56:08,766
You're right.
Yeah.

573
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:09,967
You're always right.

574
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:12,903
You always know how to
make me feel better.

575
00:56:12,937 --> 00:56:14,038
Yes, I do.

576
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:16,607
You know what?

577
00:56:17,842 --> 00:56:19,076
I think it's grilling time.

578
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,110
Mm-hmm.

579
00:56:23,448 --> 00:56:26,484
(Strumming guitar)

580
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:34,158
This reminds me
of freshman year.

581
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:35,426
You guys remember that?

582
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,627
How could I forget?

583
00:56:36,661 --> 00:56:39,530
June 22nd, Bobby Mitchell's...

584
00:56:39,564 --> 00:56:41,499
Hey, isn't that the
first time you guys...

585
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:44,134
You told him? Jerk!

586
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:45,970
Yes, of course I told him.

587
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:47,605
It was high school.

588
00:56:47,872 --> 00:56:49,574
And like you didn't tell Riss.

589
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:52,643
Riss?

590
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,482
Sorry, what was that?

591
00:56:58,148 --> 00:56:59,484
It's nothing.

592
00:56:59,517 --> 00:57:01,151
I don't think we
were friends then.

593
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:05,456
I think I'm gonna
go lay down for a bit.

594
00:57:07,558 --> 00:57:08,626
You okay?

595
00:57:08,993 --> 00:57:10,695
I'm tired. It's getting late.

596
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:12,997
I'll go with you.

597
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:16,033
No, stay. Have fun.

598
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:18,603
Are you sure?

599
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:21,639
Yes, now have a good time.

600
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:23,073
I'll be better tomorrow.

601
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:35,886
She's been acting
really strange lately.

602
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,722
Do you guys think she's
gonna try something?

603
00:57:37,755 --> 00:57:39,690
Jess, please!

604
00:57:39,724 --> 00:57:40,891
Give her some more
credit than that.

605
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:42,159
What is your problem?

606
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:43,928
Nothing.

607
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,130
Tristan: Guys, she's fine.

608
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:51,201
She's just going through a
bit of a bad spot right now.

609
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,840
I gotta give her her
meds in like a half hour.

610
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:58,075
So, I'll check on her then.

611
00:57:59,043 --> 00:58:00,210
Man, she's lucky to have you.

612
00:58:00,244 --> 00:58:02,713
Shit, I would be
lucky to have you.

613
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,224
Tristan: More for us.

614
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:21,566
(Scratching)

615
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,868
Stupid fucking bats.

616
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,572
I'll never sleep.

617
00:58:28,573 --> 00:58:29,707
Tristan: Hey.

618
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:33,110
Do you hear that?

619
00:58:34,144 --> 00:58:36,614
Bats in the wall,
they just keep scratching.

620
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,284
- There's...
- Shh! Listen.

621
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,691
There's nothing here.

622
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,860
I swear they were there.

623
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:51,228
You must have scared them off.

624
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:54,264
Why are you back so soon?

625
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,705
I came to give you your meds.

626
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:03,874
I can do it myself, you know.

627
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:06,310
I'm okay now, really.

628
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,113
I appreciate all
you're doing for me,

629
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:11,582
But you can't treat
me like a child.

630
00:59:12,182 --> 00:59:16,086
Yeah, yeah. You're right, I...

631
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:19,189
Sorry.

632
00:59:20,758 --> 00:59:22,159
Okay? I do trust you.

633
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:24,795
Here.

634
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:32,703
Hey, get some sleep.

635
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:35,205
All right? I'll make us
breakfast in the morning.

636
00:59:35,973 --> 00:59:37,642
Okay, I love you.

637
00:59:38,643 --> 00:59:39,777
Tristan: I love you, too.

638
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:22,152
(Scratching)

639
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:26,891
Carissa? What are you doing?

640
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:30,327
(Scratching stops)

641
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,199
Carissa: (Sighs)
Oh, my God.

642
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,739
I had a nightmare.

643
01:00:42,773 --> 01:00:44,141
I must have panicked.

644
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:49,146
Tristan: What are you
doing with your pills?

645
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,683
It was the scratching.

646
01:00:52,717 --> 01:00:54,251
It started again. I panicked.

647
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:26,884
(Scratching)

648
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:38,863
(Screaming)

649
01:01:40,965 --> 01:01:43,267
- (Jess screaming)
- I got you something!

650
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,269
Morning, sunshine.
It's breakfast.

651
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:48,338
He's a trophy is what he is.

652
01:01:49,106 --> 01:01:50,440
I'm gonna smell
like fish all fucking day.

653
01:01:50,474 --> 01:01:51,475
Derek: Morning, Riss.

654
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:53,077
Morning.

655
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:54,178
Derek: How'd you sleep?

656
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:58,949
What do you think?

657
01:01:58,983 --> 01:02:01,718
This is Lance.

658
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:03,988
Lance Bass.

659
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:06,323
(Laughing)

660
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:13,130
(Guys chattering)

661
01:02:13,163 --> 01:02:14,431
Tristan: I think
it's the same thing.

662
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:23,140
Derek: I am taking a piss,
so, be right back.

663
01:02:27,144 --> 01:02:28,779
Babe, you should
probably take your meds.

664
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:31,816
Can you stop doing that?

665
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:33,350
I thought we talked about this.

666
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:38,923
All right, it's just that
you scared me yesterday.

667
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:40,157
I didn't know how many you took.

668
01:02:40,991 --> 01:02:42,292
Why? What happened?

669
01:02:43,327 --> 01:02:44,995
Are you serious, Tristan?

670
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:46,396
I took one, okay?

671
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,465
I'm sorry I didn't ask
your permission first.

672
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,434
Whoa, didn't mean
to piss you off.

673
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:55,272
You've been acting
weird all weekend.

674
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:57,441
Me? You've got to be joking.

675
01:02:57,474 --> 01:02:59,343
After what I just came out of?

676
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:01,145
Yeah, so I overdosed.

677
01:03:01,178 --> 01:03:03,480
And now I feel like all
you've done is babysit me.

678
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,215
Like you've all put
me under a microscope.

679
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:08,085
Well, you have been acting
kind of strange lately.

680
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:10,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

681
01:03:10,554 --> 01:03:12,422
Am I not perky enough for you?

682
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:15,159
You've been looking at me
like I'm some sort of psycho!

683
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:17,327
Oh, do you think she
might try something?

684
01:03:17,361 --> 01:03:19,196
I didn't think
you could hear me.

685
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:20,364
Carissa: Well,
sweetheart, I did.

686
01:03:20,397 --> 01:03:21,932
And I've noticed how you've been

687
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:24,334
All over my boyfriend this
weekend, you fucking whore!

688
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:26,136
Bitch!

689
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:28,205
Are you seriously gonna let
her talk to me like this?

690
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:29,106
Fuck you!

691
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,880
Guys, what the hell's
going on? Where's Riss?

692
01:03:37,447 --> 01:03:39,116
Why would you tell her?

693
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,985
Shut up, Jess.
She doesn't know.

694
01:03:41,886 --> 01:03:42,987
Doesn't know what?

695
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,324
What's going on?

696
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:51,128
What the hell's going on? Jess?

697
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:57,234
You...

698
01:03:58,168 --> 01:03:59,870
You slept with
Tristan, didn't you?

699
01:03:59,904 --> 01:04:01,571
Derek, it was only once, okay?

700
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:03,373
I cannot believe
I didn't see this.

701
01:04:03,407 --> 01:04:05,609
You know what? Carissa saw
it the whole fucking time!

702
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:10,414
How could you do this to me?

703
01:04:12,316 --> 01:04:14,151
How could you do
this to Carissa?

704
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,152
It was a mistake, Derek!

705
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:16,453
Derek: No! You know what?

706
01:04:16,486 --> 01:04:19,356
We are done!
This is fucking done!

707
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:20,490
And you...

708
01:04:21,325 --> 01:04:24,895
Fuck! Fuck!

709
01:04:32,136 --> 01:04:33,603
(Car engine starts)

710
01:04:48,285 --> 01:04:49,519
Tristan: Everything was fine.

711
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:50,921
You had to open your mouth.

712
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,290
Babe, I'm sorry.

713
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:55,225
Don't call me that. Don't, no.

714
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:01,065
(Whispering)
Mistake.

715
01:05:01,098 --> 01:05:02,132
Tristan.

716
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:09,439
(Scratching)

717
01:05:20,317 --> 01:05:21,651
(Slamming)

718
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,122
(Carissa whimpering)

719
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:29,659
(Carissa screaming)

720
01:05:31,495 --> 01:05:32,529
Tristan: Carissa?

721
01:05:49,746 --> 01:05:53,317
Jess, get a towel or a
blanket or something.

722
01:06:03,227 --> 01:06:04,661
Okay. Okay.

723
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:07,564
Go to my room and
get a clean shirt.

724
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:17,074
It's just her period.

725
01:06:20,344 --> 01:06:23,013
Tristan, her pills are
all over the floor up there.

726
01:06:23,047 --> 01:06:24,181
What?

727
01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:27,051
Baby, what did you do?

728
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:29,586
Call Derek.

729
01:06:29,619 --> 01:06:31,155
What if he doesn't answer?

730
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:32,589
Leave a message.

731
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:44,334
* Fuck you, you're dead to me

732
01:06:45,069 --> 01:06:47,671
* Fuck you, you're dead to me

733
01:06:51,575 --> 01:06:56,580
(Phone buzzing)

734
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:16,533
* Stand in my way,
you're like a barricade *

735
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:20,470
* But I, but I,
but I won't stop *

736
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:21,438
What?

737
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:22,772
Jess: Derek, you
need to come back.

738
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,741
What do you want me to say?

739
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:26,210
Jess: No, Derek,
it's Carissa.

740
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:27,611
There's blood everywhere.

741
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:29,513
(Crying)
We need you here.

742
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,249
Derek?

743
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:38,688
Fuck.

744
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:49,233
(Eerie whispering)

745
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:12,422

746
01:08:12,456 --> 01:08:15,825

747
01:08:17,361 --> 01:08:20,230
(Eerie whispering)

748
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:04,674
(Scratching)

749
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:20,624
(Gasping)
(Choking)

750
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:34,204
(Scratching)

751
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:39,709
(Footsteps)

752
01:09:44,748 --> 01:09:46,916
(Eerie whispering)

753
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:48,818

754
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:04,234

756
01:10:10,674 --> 01:10:12,208
(Scratching)

757
01:10:22,018 --> 01:10:23,720
I'm so sorry.

758
01:10:25,422 --> 01:10:26,523
Carissa?

759
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:28,892
Don't you hear it?

760
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:30,760
Carissa, what are
you talking about?

761
01:10:32,696 --> 01:10:35,332
The scratching.
Don't you hear it?

762
01:10:35,365 --> 01:10:37,334
Is that blood?
Where's Tristan?

763
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:40,504
(Jess screaming)

764
01:10:47,844 --> 01:10:52,849
(Dragging)

765
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:01,291
(Thudding)

766
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,337
(Carissa groaning)

767
01:11:19,843 --> 01:11:22,011

(Screaming)

make it stop.

(Groaning)

772
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:14,698
(Screaming)

773
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:15,732
Derek: No!

774
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:16,933
(Slicing)

775
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:19,536
(Eerie screaming)

776
01:12:27,611 --> 01:12:29,746
Police Operator: 911,
state your emergency.

777
01:12:30,547 --> 01:12:32,115
911. Hello?

778
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:33,850
Is someone there?

779
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:35,051
Yes, I'm here.

780
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:38,021
Someone's been on
my lawn for about,

781
01:12:38,722 --> 01:12:40,457
I don't know, like,
30 minutes now.

782
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,626
Operator: Okay,
ma'am. What's your name?

783
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:45,762
My name is Melissa,
Melissa Crow.

784
01:12:45,795 --> 01:12:46,830
Operator: Okay, Melissa.

785
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:49,065
Are you able to identify
the person outside?

786
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:50,700
Can you describe
what they're wearing?

787
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:52,669
It looks like a man.

788
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:57,607
But there's a mask on
his face, if it's a man.

789
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:03,079
He's wearing white
shirt and pants.

790
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:04,714
He looks pretty dirty.

791
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:06,850
Operator: Has this man
threatened you at all?

792
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,818
Is he carrying a weapon?

793
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:11,054
Yeah, he has a knife.

794
01:13:11,621 --> 01:13:12,722
Operator: Okay, Melissa.

795
01:13:12,756 --> 01:13:13,790
We're sending someone over,

796
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:15,559
Based on the location
of your cell phone.

797
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,827
Someone should be there
within a few minutes.

798
01:13:17,861 --> 01:13:18,528
I need you to stay
on the line with me

799
01:13:18,562 --> 01:13:20,597
Until the police arrive.

800
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:23,433
Are all of your doors
locked? Are you safe?

801
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:24,868
Melissa: Yeah,
my doors are locked.

802
01:13:26,703 --> 01:13:29,873
I'm just in my living
room right now so...

803
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:32,776
Oh, my God.

804
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:36,746
I think he can see
me through my window.

805
01:13:38,181 --> 01:13:40,450
Is anyone gonna be here soon?

806
01:13:40,484 --> 01:13:41,851
Just cause he's standing there,

807
01:13:41,885 --> 01:13:44,688
And he's walking closer
and he's right there.

808
01:13:44,721 --> 01:13:46,022
He can see me.

809
01:13:46,055 --> 01:13:47,591
- Operator: Okay, Melissa.
- Melissa: Yeah?

810
01:13:47,624 --> 01:13:49,859
Operator: Please
try to remain calm,

811
01:13:49,893 --> 01:13:51,461
And get to somewhere safe.

812
01:13:51,495 --> 01:13:52,829
Are you alone in the house?

813
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:56,666
Yeah, yeah,
I'm alone, just me.
