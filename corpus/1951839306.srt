1
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,680
Deep in the heart of Africa
is a place no man has ever entered.

2
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,600
A place that belongs to the lion,
the elephant and the ape.

3
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,160
A place known as the Bukuvu.

4
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,920
Travellers flying overhead
can only glimpse at its many marvels:

5
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,240
its sparkling rivers...

6
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,360
its lush veldts,
its billowy cloud formations...

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,280
and its hidden mountains.

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,400
- Never fear, my friends.
- George!
- George!

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,360
- All was not lost.
- George!

10
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,440
Scraped and boo-booed,
they searched high and low...

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,280
but they never recovered
their most precious cargo.

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,880
George, George
George of the Jungle

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,000
Strong as he can be

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,320
Watch out for that tree

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,400
George, George
George of the Jungle

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,800
Lives a life that's free

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,840
Watch out for that tree

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,040
When he gets in a scrape
he makes his escape

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,000
With help from his friend
an ape named Ape

20
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,320
And his elephant Shep
can fetch a log

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,200
He's man's best friend
He's George's dog

22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,920
He's George, George
George of the Jungle

23
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,920
Strong as he can be

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,240
Watch out for that tree

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,200
Hear him holler
swing and sing

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,640
All the animals come
to the jungle king

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,520
George, George
George of the Jungle

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
George, George
George of the Jungle

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,920
So grab a vine
and swing in time

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,640
If you smack a tree
just pay no mind

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,400
Like George, George
George of the Jungle

32
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,480
Strong as he can be

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,680
Watch out for that tree

34
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,080
Watch out for that--
Bang! Ooh! Tree

35
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,680
George, George
George of the Jungle

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,760
Watch out for that tree

37
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,000
Twenty-five years later,
the bouncing baby boy...

38
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,760
has grown into
a swinging jungle king.

39
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,840
He is swift. He is strong.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,160
He is sure. He is smart.

41
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,000
He is unconscious.

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,280
Meanwhile, 43 vines away...

43
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,720
George's kingdom was being threatened
by a terrifying intruder.

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,640
Hi, everybody. Me again.

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,920
Third day in Mbwebwe.
Look at this incredible--

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,920
- Banyan tree.
- Banyan tree. And look what's in it.

47
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,520
Could you die?

48
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,600
And over here...

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,840
is the outhouse, which you
don't want to see, believe me.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,720
By the way, Betsy, thank you so
much for those moist towelettes.

51
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,040
They've been a lifesaver.

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,600
And these are the wonderful porters.
Wave, guys.

53
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,960
And this is our guide, Mr Kwame.

54
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Without him, we would be lost.
Hi.

55
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,760
This is great.

56
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,840
- And this is Lyle.
- Hello, Bujumburans.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,800
- What are you doing here?
- What kind of greeting is that
to give your fiance?

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,040
- Aren't you happy to see me?
- Yeah, of course I am.

59
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
The jungle loves you.
You're beautiful.

60
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,000
- How did you find me?
- Well, I just hired the two
best trackers in the business.

61
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,480
Ah, I'm chafing, Max.
Ah, yeah, I'm chafing big time.

62
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,320
Didn't I tell you not to wear 20 pounds
of black leather in the jungle?

63
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,400
- Didn't I tell ya?
- Ah.

64
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,160
Cotton, I said. Cotton breathes.

65
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,920
Take my things to the lady's tent
and shake a leg.

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,080
Later that night, Lyle Van de Groot
lost no time in making arrangements...

67
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,640
-to whisk his wayward fiancee back home.
-All right, I'll take it, I'll take it.

68
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,079
Nairobi Hilton.
They can airlift us there in two hours.

69
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,040
Pillows, okay?

70
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,160
Wait a second. I'm losing you.
Bad reception here.

71
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,679
Okay, I've got you back.
No, wait! I'm losing you!

72
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,399
My batteries are dead!
No! Doody!

73
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,359
I don't want to go anyway, Lyle.
Tomorrow we're gonna....

74
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,440
climb the mountain where the big apes
are. Don't you wanna see them?

75
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,959
Only if they can shake a good gin
martini without bruising it. Hiyo!

76
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:43,920
Me and Thor here would be happy
to help you and the lady up
the mountain, Mr Van de Groot.

77
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,239
- Yeah.
- With Mr Kwame leading the way,
of course.

78
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,720
If you don't mind me saying so,
the apes...

79
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,279
are supposed to be a fascinating sight,
especially that white ape.

80
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,000
White ape? What's that?

81
00:04:57,119 --> 00:05:01,079
Ask Mr Kwame.
I bet he can tell you.

82
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:05,959
- It is only a native legend.
- Could you please tell us?

83
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,839
The people say he is
over seven feet tall...

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,200
with the strength of a lion.

85
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:14,720
When the moon is full
and the air is sweet...

86
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,920
he wanders alone
through the jungle...

87
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:21,480
piercing the silence of the valley
with his mournful call.

88
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,440
Now, some say he is
thirsty for blood.

89
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,359
Others say he is calling
for the mate that he longs for...

90
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,760
but will never find.

91
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,200
By day, he rules the entire Bukuvu
from the top of the mountain.

92
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:38,279
But by night--

93
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,640
He and Bigfoot run the candy counter
at the Bukuvu Cineplex.

94
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,399
Now playing on all 14 screens:

95
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,600
Planet of the Apes.

96
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,600
Bigfoot? Max, that'd be worth
a lot more than any white--

97
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,160
- Ursula, what are we doing here?
- Lyle, I came all this way--

98
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Okay, okay.
The things I do for you.

99
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,320
Looks like we're on, fellows.

100
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,679
As the sun rose
over Ape Mountain...

101
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,799
its agitated inhabitants sent an urgent
message to George by bongo-gram...

102
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:12,959
warning the jungle king that
intruders were close afoot.

103
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:15,040
Ooh. Lyle, listen.
What was that?

104
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,959
Could be the mating call
of the white ape.

105
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:20,320
Huh. White ape.
Sounds like a drink.

106
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,440
Uh, yes, bartender. I'll have
two Black Russians and a white ape.

107
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,600
A drink the venal Van de Groot
would be begging to imbibe...

108
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,440
if he only knew how near the white ape
was at that very moment...

109
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,559
flying through the foliage,
surveying the scenery, cruising in...

110
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,760
for a closer look and swinging on
through the trees with effortless ease.

111
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,839
Ow!

112
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,679
And so, onward and upward
the tired trekkers trudged...

113
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,519
on feverish footsies
over perilous paths.

114
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:51,679
When they finally beheld the mighty
Ape Mountain, they reacted with awe.

115
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,079
- Aww.
- I said "awe." A-W-E.

116
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:59,600
- Ooh!
- That's better.

117
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,640
Single file on the bridge.
Step very cautiously.

118
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:07,760
It is full of rotten planks.
One false move, you could fall over.

119
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,600
Then you will have
a very long time to wave goodbye.

120
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,320
Don't you worry, peanut.
I was on a bridge like this in Maui.

121
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
It was steady as a rock.
See?

122
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,000
Hey! S-Stop! Stop that!
Stop that! What th--

123
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,519
Yee-haw!

124
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,440
- I got you.
- No!

125
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,480
Don't worry.
Nobody dies in this story.

126
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,279
They just get
really big boo-boos.

127
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,720
What did I tell you?

128
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,040
You know, they shouldn't let
inexperienced guides
like that on these treks.

129
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,880
Did you see the look
that guy just gave me?

130
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,600
Probably saying I'm the biggest jerk
they've ever seen in their lives.

131
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,959
Probably trying to think
of something evil to do to me.

132
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,600
If they turn on us,
we're never gonna get home.

133
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,959
It's up to me to make the peace.
I'm going in.

134
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:13,760
Gentlemen. Cigar, cigarette?

135
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Okay, gifts from America.

136
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,799
- Hey, hey.
- I give you a cigar,
you give me some of your lands.

137
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,600
All right.
A first contact has been made.

138
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,679
Ready, aim--

139
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,400
There you go, my man. Huh?

140
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,640
You like magic fire? Do ya?

141
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,359
Well, get a load of this.

142
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,440
There you go. Magic picture.

143
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,799
Yet another gift from America.
Here you go.

144
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,400
You're welcome.

145
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:54,799
Thirty-five millimetre.

146
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,159
Translation, please.

147
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,280
He says that he likes
your magic pictures...

148
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,960
but he prefers the resolution of
the Leica 35 millimetre transparencies.

149
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:15,280
He also says your lens is dirty, but he
has the equipment to clean it for you.

150
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,239
Well, tell him to clean this
while he's at it.

151
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,119
- Come on, let's go.
- Where?

152
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,080
Find you an ape, so we
can get the heck outta here.

153
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:30,880
Lyle, we can't go into the jungle alone.
We could get lost out here.

154
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,440
It's my job to get you
what you want.

155
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:34,919
You want a double decaf
latte with mocha sprinkles...

156
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,559
you will get a double decaf
latte with mocha sprinkles.

157
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:40,799
You want a white ape,
I'll get you a white ape.

158
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,320
Here, monkey, monkey, monkey.

159
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:46,280
Here, gorilla, gorilla.
Come on.

160
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,799
- Don't move.
- You mean I actually found one?
It worked?

161
00:10:07,359 --> 00:10:10,880
- God, that scared me.
- Scared me, too.

162
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:19,960
I'm gonna go get help.
You wait here.

163
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,880
Oh, no.

164
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,840
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

165
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,479
When lion brush last?

166
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:45,880
Don't tickle.
Don't ti-- No--

167
00:11:58,359 --> 00:12:01,880
Rubber tree always good for clothesline.
Upsy, kitty.

168
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,359
George not even trying hard.

169
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:25,440
Flying pile driver.
Havin' some fun now.

170
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:28,080
Bad kitty!

171
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,760
- That close one, huh?
- Watch out for that tree!

172
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,960
Huh?

173
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,799
Oops.

174
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:02,799
Funny-looking fella.

175
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
White ape.

176
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:17,640
Y-- Y-- U-Ursula!
Ursu-- Wha--

177
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,200
Ursula, I found your scrunchie.

178
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,599
Go away!

179
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,119
It was horrible.

180
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,640
It was-- 400-pound
white ape man.

181
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:10,239
The white ape
has my girlfriend.

182
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,679
I held him off as long as I could.
Blood everywhere.

183
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,440
The white ape-- my girlfriend.

184
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,479
He-- He weighs 400 pounds.

185
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,919
The white ape got my girlfriend!
The white ape got--

186
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,960
Help! Help! Man needs help!

187
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,359
After a night
of feverish fantasies...

188
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,559
the perfectly permed heiress,
Ursula Stanhope...

189
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:50,320
awoke to the melodious music of the
Bukuvu bird life, and found herself...

190
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:53,799
venturing forth in search
of that defender of the innocent...

191
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,400
protector of the weak,
and all-around good guy...

192
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,640
George of the Jungle.

193
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:05,159
But that's not
who she saw first.

194
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,080
What!

195
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:13,080
Get away! Get away!
Get away!

196
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,119
- Hello. Oop!
- Oh, dear.

197
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:35,200
Feeling better, fella?

198
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:37,960
Okay. It's that dream, then.

199
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:40,799
I'm still having that
psycho dream. Hello.

200
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,359
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh, no, no! Don't worry! Ape friend.

201
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,440
- Ape make your breakfast.
- What does it want?
What does it want?

202
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:52,440
"It" wants its Physician's
Desk Reference, if you don't mind.

203
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:55,479
Unless you'd rather die
of dengue fever, of course.

204
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,640
That is very funny!

205
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,799
I thought I heard
the monkey talk.

206
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,919
But that is totally
understandable, right?

207
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,559
I mean, why wouldn't
an ape read textbooks?

208
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:10,080
And why wouldn't I find
myself in a tree house...

209
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:15,359
with room service and a Tarzan wannabe,
wearing a, um, um--

210
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,440
- What do you call that thing?
- Butt flap.

211
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,840
Right.

212
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,919
Ohh--

213
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,840
Ooh!

214
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:32,400
Bit of a shock, I suppose. Yes.

215
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,119
Fever.

216
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,400
Cold compress. Dab her lightly, George.
"Talking monkey."

217
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,960
That's the ticket. Good.

218
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:47,520
Huh? Somethin' funny
about this fella.

219
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,400
She's not a "fella," George. She's
a woman, the female of your species.

220
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,919
You mean Ape and George
not brothers?

221
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:58,119
Well, in a sense,
we are related.

222
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,640
After all, we're both members
of the primate family.

223
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,599
Primate family. Brothers.

224
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,800
I suppose one might claim
that there would--

225
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,719
Mommy, make that monkey
stop talking.

226
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,359
Perhaps I should refrain from speaking
around her, as it seems to upset her.

227
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,239
- What your name?
- Ursula.

228
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,319
Ursula Stanhope.

229
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,920
- Who are you?
- George.

230
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:43,520
George Primate.

231
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,079
And that brother Ape.
Ape Primate.

232
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:50,400
Ah! Oh, um--

233
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,239
Okay, I'm gonna
pass out again now.

234
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,359
Bye.

235
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,760
It's a sissy white ape.
I would've choked the life out of him...

236
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,880
except that he had two of his
lion buddies jump me from behind.

237
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,599
So in this version,
there are two lions with the white ape?

238
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,079
A minute ago,
there was only one.

239
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:15,680
H-Hey, the important thing,
Kwame, is that I was outnumbered.

240
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:20,119
Absolutely.

241
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,400
Ursula!

242
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,079
Hi. When I woke up this morning,
I remembered about that lion...

243
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:50,520
and I know you
saved me yesterday.

244
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,880
- And I just wanted to say thank you.
- Ah!

245
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,160
Ooh!

246
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,839
Now that I'm feeling better,
I realize the others must think
I'm cat food by now.

247
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,479
And I don't want my fian--
this guy that I was with-- to worry.

248
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,680
So, so I should probably go
and look for them...

249
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,560
and I was wondering
if you could help me.

250
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:11,599
Uh-- Ursula want to go already?

251
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,119
Okay, George help.
Get trusty doggy.

252
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,160
Oh, you have a dog.
That's great.

253
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:21,520
Doggy will help find friends.
George call Shep.

254
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,719
Shep! Here, boy!

255
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,160
Come on! Here, boy.

256
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:29,479
Shep!

257
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,239
Here comes Shep.
Come on, Shep! Come on, boy!

258
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,560
That a boy! Want to play?
Come on! Come on! Come on!

259
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,319
Good boy.

260
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:47,319
Come on, boy! Come on!
Good boy, Shep! Come on!

261
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,839
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

262
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Sit. Sit.

263
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,000
Good boy!
Good obedience training.

264
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,520
- George trained from pup.
- That's your dog?

265
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,000
This Shep, George's big,
grey, peanut-lovin' poochie.

266
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,079
Good boy, Shep! Good boy.

267
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,640
Good boy, Shep. Good boy.

268
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,680
- That's a good boy. Wanna shake?
- Huh?

269
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,520
- Good doggy. Be nice.
- Shep.

270
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,719
Shake? George. George.

271
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,719
George!

272
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,160
- See? Shep shake.
- Oh, George.

273
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:35,199
He's a big poochie, all right.

274
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,280
Does he fetch?

275
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,359
Here, boy. Come on, boy.
Want a stick?

276
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,719
Want a stick?
Where's the stick?

277
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,880
Where's the stick, Shep?

278
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,880
Here it is.
Here, boy. Fetch!

279
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,400
Come on, boy!
Run, run! Run, boy!

280
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,160
Atta boy! Good boy.
Go on, boy! Go get it!

281
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:08,640
Where'd he go?

282
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,160
- Wow!
- No, not in the roses!

283
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,280
Ungawa, Shep!

284
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:22,280
And so, with the help
of the jungle king's big, grey...

285
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:25,319
peanut-loving poochie,
George and Ursula set out...

286
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:29,160
on a desperate search to find
her fianc-- uh, that guy she was with--

287
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:31,920
Lyle! Lyle!

288
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,719
- Ursula! Ursula!
- while he desperately
searched for her.

289
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,760
But by the end of the afternoon
her desperation had dimmed...

290
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
That was fantastic!

291
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:45,400
and she had given up
all hope of everything...

292
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:50,040
except enjoying the jungle king's
company from her precarious perch
atop his faithful doggy.

293
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:53,239
- So, where are we going now?
- To find Tookie-Tookie bird
for jungle news.

294
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,359
Tookie-Tookie bird.
I love that.

295
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,079
Later they rested,
while the tired tusker teethed on a--

296
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:03,319
Wait a second.
The dog bone is too much. Lose it.

297
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:05,400
That's better.

298
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,800
Bongo-gram.
What could it mean?

299
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:13,760
Tookie-Tookie!

300
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:21,400
Tookie say
little monkey in trouble.

301
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,400
George investigate.

302
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,199
Tookie-Tookie!

303
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:41,239
What happened?

304
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,079
- Oh!
- Where other monkeys?

305
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,239
Where? There?

306
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,839
How many? That many?

307
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,520
Lots of monkey.
Then what happened?

308
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:56,319
Tell George more.

309
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:58,439
No!

310
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:02,640
Little monkey say other monkeys
call little monkey "runt."

311
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,680
- Not let little monkey play games.
- Poor thing. Hi, monkey.

312
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,040
H-Hi. You okay?

313
00:23:13,199 --> 00:23:15,000
No.

314
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,640
Don't cry.

315
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:23,280
Huh.

316
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:26,479
Little monkey like Ursula.

317
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,040
- What did you tell him?
- Just watch.

318
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:56,359
Uh-oh!

319
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,920
Meanwhile, back at a really
big footprint in the mud--

320
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:48,160
Let me through.
What's happening?

321
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,160
This footprint does not
belong to any of my men.

322
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:54,800
See? There's your proof.
The white ape does exist.

323
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:58,800
Now all we have to do is track down
the girl and the ape's in the bag.

324
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:01,680
N-No, seriously. I don't know
if I want to do this again.

325
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,199
Ursula need to relax when it come
to vine swinging, for George.

326
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,280
Swing, swing, swing.
Come on.

327
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:12,719
Want George of Jungle to tell you
special vine-swinging secret?

328
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,800
Fine. Tell me all your secrets.

329
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:19,439
George's secrets. Hm!
There's the shortest book ever written.

330
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,199
- Oh.
- Wrap it around your sock for
special George of Jungle foot lock.

331
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:27,640
- Now, ready to try again?
- No.

332
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:46,400
- Like this, Ursula!
- He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

333
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,760
Our daring young man
on the flying trapeze

334
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,119
- Look, no hands!
- His movements so graceful
All girls he could please

335
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,520
And with love
he is swinging away

336
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,239
- He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease
- That's pretty good.

337
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,479
- George, watch out for that...
- Our daring young man on the--

338
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,119
tree.

339
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:23,319
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the king of the jungle.

340
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:34,680
Where the devil is my egg timer?

341
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,319
- Tookie-Tookie.
- Tookie!

342
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:41,040
I'm fed up with this felonious fowl
stealing everything in the kitchen.

343
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:45,079
- Miserable creature.
- Tookie-Tookie.

344
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:48,199
George, what on earth
are you doing?

345
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:51,479
George just feel like looking
a little special today, that all.

346
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,959
Possibly there is a stirring
of special feelings within you?

347
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:01,640
Uh-huh.

348
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,400
George having stirring
of special feelings right now.

349
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,199
I see.

350
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,680
- Good thing she same species, huh?
- Yes.

351
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:21,599
Ape?

352
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,280
Tell George how to make
Ursula George's mate.

353
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:28,520
Please? Brother?

354
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,520
First, command her attention by bulging
out your cheeks and pursing your lips.

355
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,359
- Show George.
- All right. Just like this. Watch.

356
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:45,199
Even puffier.

357
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,000
Next, display your interest
by drawing back your upper lip...

358
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,160
jutting your jaw forward
and exposing your teeth.

359
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,560
- Like this? Like this? Right?
- Now, throw a handful
of leaves in the air...

360
00:27:56,719 --> 00:28:00,280
then leap about and hoot
in a dominant fashion.

361
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,760
-Like this, Ape?
-Good. She won't be able to resist that.

362
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,880
Ursula!

363
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,479
Gosh, this trail's really rough.

364
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:23,680
"Ursula! Ursula!"

365
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,920
- Hey, come back here.
- They're not abandoning us, are they?

366
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,079
They are threatening.

367
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,319
If you don't mind, Kwame...

368
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:39,439
I have a knack for getting
the most out of my employees.

369
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,439
- Do you mind if I address the porters?
- They only speak Swahili.

370
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,439
Well, I just happen to have
a Swahili phrase book.

371
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:49,760
Be my guest.

372
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:12,599
I think our troubles are over.

373
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,119
Tell them I'll pay 50 zamoles
a man if they'll help me capture
the white ape and bring him back alive.

374
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,119
Alive? After he, uh--

375
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,160
Well, he pulled Ursula's scrunchie off,
we know that much.

376
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:27,719
- 50 zamoles a man. What do you say?
- They only speak Swahili.

377
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,479
One hundred zamoles a man
and you got a deal.

378
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,479
- Hey, wait a second.
- Done.

379
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:38,040
Meanwhile, at a very big
and expensive waterfall set...

380
00:29:38,199 --> 00:29:41,199
Ursula was amazed that she was lost
in the wilderness with a jungle man.

381
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,920
Here I am, lost in the wilderness
with a jungle man.

382
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:54,000
I should be terrified that no one
will ever find me, but I'm not.

383
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:58,719
- Thank you.
- For what?

384
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,119
For this adventure.

385
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,560
It's what I've always wanted.

386
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,680
King of jungle
only here to help.

387
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:16,280
Mr Boombastic

388
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,000
The awesome, boombastic
romantic, fantastic lover

389
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,079
Sade

390
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,239
Mr Lover-Lover

391
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,199
- Mr Lover-Lover
- George, are you okay?

392
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,680
- Mr Lover-Lover
- Your face is swelling up like--

393
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:33,880
- Ah, Mr Lover-Lover
- Is something in my teeth?

394
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,680
Okay.

395
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:51,599
Listen, um...

396
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,079
I'm gonna step outside
for a little air, okay?

397
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,959
- Are you sure you threw the leaves?
- Yeah, George threw leaves.

398
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:06,880
Well, cheer up, old boy.
I spent all day...

399
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,239
poring through every book
in the library...

400
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,199
and finally I found this.

401
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:17,160
It's positively packed full
of human courtship rituals.

402
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:20,719
Listen.
"What's a nice girl like you...

403
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,800
doing in a plane like this?"

404
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,359
Go for it.

405
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

406
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,680
What-- Oh.

407
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:56,160
- Did you fight a crocodile for this?
- Oh. No, George not fight.

408
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:59,040
Crocodile have toothache.

409
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:03,800
George pull tooth.
Crocodile give to George after. Gift.

410
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:05,199
Good juju.

411
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:09,079
- Juju?
- Good luck. Protection.

412
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,040
I have something like that too.
Want to see?

413
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,400
It's not worth anything.

414
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,319
I found it in a cereal box
when I was ten years old.

415
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:26,760
It's my good luck. My juju.

416
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,079
- Can l--
- Oh.

417
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:47,119
I want you to have that.

418
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,199
For George?

419
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,479
That's the nicest present
George ever get.

420
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,239
Thank you.

421
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,959
- All right, man.
- Yeah.

422
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:13,520
It dancin' time.

423
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,839
- Ursula, wanna dance?
- Oh, no. Thanks.

424
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,880
- I'd be too embarrassed.
- What mean "embarrassed"?

425
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,959
That's when you feel stupid
in front of other people.

426
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,520
You know, like
they're judging you.

427
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,359
- You've never felt that?
- No.

428
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,880
There are no other people.

429
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,199
- Good point.
- George not feel stupid.

430
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:39,079
Sometimes George smash
into tree, and sometime--

431
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,959
Sometimes George fall out of tree house,
but not feel stupid.

432
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,880
Something good
always happen after.

433
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,239
George just lucky, I guess.

434
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,920
One day I looked up
and there you were

435
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,079
No people here to look stupid for.
Just George.

436
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:07,560
Like a simple question
looking for an answer

437
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:12,000
Now I am a whale
Listening to some inner call

438
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,840
Swimming blindly to throw
myself upon your shore

439
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,479
What if I don't find you
when I have landed

440
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,800
Would you leave me here to die
on your shore, stranded

441
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:27,919
Think I know why
the dog howls at the moon

442
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:32,959
I think I know why
the dog howls at the moon

443
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,520
I sing dela, dela

444
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,600
When I'm with you

445
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,879
I burn for you

446
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,399
I've been waiting for you
all my life

447
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,360
Hoping for a miracle

448
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,000
I've been waiting day and night
Day and night

449
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:05,320
I've been waiting for you all my life
Waiting for redemption

450
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:09,919
I've been waiting day and night
I burn for you

451
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:25,840
And so it came to pass
that George of the Jungle...

452
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,399
attended his first co-ed dance.

453
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,159
But his rapturous rendezvous with the
urban heiress was to be short-lived...

454
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,600
as the very next morning, Kwame and
his men were drawing dangerously close.

455
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,120
That is, dangerously close to shoving
a coconut up Lyle's sleeping bag.

456
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,040
That's it! I've had it!

457
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:56,120
I am the richest, smartest, handsomest
guy here, so I get to go first.

458
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,040
There's an elephant around here.

459
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:08,000
Bad guy falls in poop.
Classical element of physical comedy.

460
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:11,560
Now comes the part where we throw
our heads back and laugh. Ready?

461
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,959
Ready.

462
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,320
Those were nowhere near
properly digested.

463
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:24,320
In case anybody's
wondering, I'm okay.

464
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:28,040
Have you cleaned my lighter yet?

465
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:38,479
Come on, come on.

466
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:44,080
That was Ursula.
Did you hear that?

467
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,800
She's alive. Ursula--

468
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:50,199
Why don't you bring on a brass band
while you're at it, you nit?

469
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,199
We gotta be stealthy here, right?

470
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,679
Stealthy. Right.

471
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:03,439
Party time.
We'll take it from here.

472
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,120
Get off!

473
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,919
It's him!

474
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,280
Hey, it's a dude. I told you
there weren't no white ape.

475
00:37:28,439 --> 00:37:31,600
You dragged me all the way
up here to look at some guy
in a leopard-skin bikini.

476
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,120
- If I wanted to see that,
I could've stayed in Miami.
- Wait a second.

477
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,520
The white ape is a man?
Let me at him.

478
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:42,959
Hang on. Could you, uh, see
if he's dangerous?

479
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,000
Here, boy!
Where's my little doggy?

480
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,719
I've got a feeling he's not.

481
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:49,800
Okay. I'll go first.

482
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:52,560
If he gets aggressive,
I'll scare him off with this.

483
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,399
- I thought that was a lighter.
- It is a lighter,
but he doesn't know that.

484
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:04,800
Ursula, it's me.

485
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:09,600
Lyle. Your man.
I've come for you. Are you okay?

486
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,120
Ursula!

487
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,919
- Lyle, what are you doing here?
- Thank God.

488
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,919
Mushy bear, you're safe.
I don't believe it!

489
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,239
Oh, I was so afraid
for your safety.

490
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,560
Lyle! Don't get all smoochy
and disgusting with me, okay?

491
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,879
I remember what you did
when that lion came.

492
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,479
What are you talking about?
I was fighting the lion the whole time.

493
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:42,639
You were just so terrified
you don't remember.

494
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,639
- I remember George,
that's who I remember.
- George?

495
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,879
Look over there.
What do you see?

496
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,399
- An elephant.
- But what has the elephant got?

497
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,320
- Fleas.
- Ivory! White gold.

498
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:04,479
Listen, Ursula, I have no idea what
you're talking about. Can we just go?

499
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:07,479
- George!
- Ursula!

500
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:09,439
Ready...

501
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,679
aim...

502
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:18,760
Run, Shep!
Run for your life!

503
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:20,840
Did that monkey just speak?

504
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,879
That monkey just spoke.

505
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,959
- I knew it.
- He talked.

506
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,959
- Shoot it now.
- Huh?

507
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,959
With the tranquillizer gun, idiot!
That ape's worth a fortune.

508
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,840
No!

509
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,479
Stop, or I'll shoot!

510
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,399
- No!
- No!

511
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,760
George!

512
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:54,800
Whew! Okay, kids, let's settle down
and review the important information.

513
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,000
Lyle is a big doofus.
Poor George was really shot...

514
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:59,639
but can't die because,
let's face it, he's the hero.

515
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,080
So, the naturally concerned
and preternaturally wealthy
Ursula Stanhope...

516
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:06,360
whisked George off on a private jet
bound for the country of his birth...

517
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,360
where he would get the finest
medical treatment available.

518
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,360
I'm gonna get you the finest
medical treatment available.

519
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,479
As for those pesky, pernicious
and putrid poachers, Max and Thor...

520
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:20,800
they awaited their fate
in the Bujumbura jail.

521
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:23,399
You two, out.

522
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,639
- Acquitted?
- No, deported.

523
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,679
Meanwhile, Kwame and his men faced
the next-to-impossible task...

524
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,560
of picking out George's assailant
from a line-up of the usual suspects.

525
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:37,120
Too short. Too sweaty.

526
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,600
Wait a second! That's the guy.
That's the guy who shot him.

527
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,439
- I never forget a face.
- Me?

528
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,760
No, Max. Forget about it. I do not want
to listen to any more of your ideas.

529
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:57,959
You'll like this one. We're gonna steal
Georgie-boy's talking ape.

530
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,560
- You mean, back up the mountain?
- Thor, that ape is our ticket...

531
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:03,199
out of poaching
and into show business.

532
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,239
- No.
- Think about it. We got a talking ape.

533
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:08,239
What do Siegfried and Roy have?

534
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,639
- Sequins?
- Exactly.

535
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,600
Get ready for room service,
mate, and girls.

536
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,959
We're gettin' our ape
and going to Vegas.

537
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,199
By next weekend,
we'll be headlining at the Tropicana.

538
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,600
- Nobody is gonna stop us.
- Right.

539
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,399
George of the Jungle
must be halfway to Frisco by now.

540
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,000
Ah, but the plotting poachers
were only half correct...

541
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:32,439
for at that very moment, our handsome
hero was all the way to San Francisco.

542
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,679
- Yes, Mother, I'm safe.
- You're sure you didn't
catch dengue fever?

543
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,760
No, Mother, I did not
catch dengue fever.

544
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:40,080
- Well, how's your temperature?
- Normal.

545
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:43,280
- Colour of your tongue?
- Pink.

546
00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:45,360
- What about your hmm-hmm?
- Regular.

547
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,439
Now, Lyle.
How is my darling future son-in-law?

548
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,239
Lyle is--

549
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:55,959
He's happy to be home, Mom.
Could you hold on one second?

550
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,959
George, please don't call any animals
into the car, okay? Thanks.

551
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,520
Mom? You there?

552
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:10,719
Mom, hold on. I'm losing you again.
George. George. No.

553
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:13,280
Are you paying any attention?
This is important.

554
00:42:13,439 --> 00:42:18,439
No. I know it's important. Geo-Geo--
George. George. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

555
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:22,360
This faster than riding big,
great, peanut-loving poochie Shep.

556
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,800
Love you, Mom. Gotta go.
Bye. Watch out for that--

557
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:29,320
Ooh!

558
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So, what do you
think of my jungle?

559
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:40,600
This very high tree house.

560
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,879
Good place to call friends from.
Sound carry.

561
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,399
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

562
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,800
The neighbours.

563
00:42:52,399 --> 00:42:54,280
- Give it a rest!
- We're ten storeys up, George.

564
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:57,520
I don't think the animals
can make it up here.

565
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:00,040
Oh, sure.
George know that.

566
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:03,040
George know that.

567
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,520
You must be tired. I'll, um...

568
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:17,919
make the couch up for you
to sleep in the living room.

569
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,000
Oh, no. George sleep here
in tree house.

570
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:24,000
Okay. Good night.

571
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,239
Sleep sweet, Ursula.

572
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,520
Sleep sweet, George.

573
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:36,399
Ooh.

574
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:40,239
Well, Ursula's fiance
is in prison...

575
00:43:40,399 --> 00:43:42,520
and there's a jungle man
sleeping on her balcony.

576
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:44,919
- She could use a best friend right now.
- Hi.

577
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,879
- Hi.
- I got here as fast as I could.

578
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,439
- Where is he?
- He's under the waterf--
He's in the shower.

579
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,360
Not any more.

580
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,280
- George.
- Oh. Bad waterfall.

581
00:43:53,439 --> 00:43:57,520
First water get hot, then George slip
on this strange, yellow rock. Oh!

582
00:43:59,479 --> 00:44:03,320
- Hi. George of Jungle.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

583
00:44:03,479 --> 00:44:07,639
George.
Um, take this big book.

584
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,120
Whoop! Cover the booty,
get into decent clothes.

585
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,760
- Sorry, Betsy.
- Bye.
- No problem.

586
00:44:12,919 --> 00:44:16,280
- Okay.
- I see why they made him
king of the jungle.

587
00:44:16,439 --> 00:44:18,399
Betsy, I am
in trouble here, okay?

588
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,679
How am I gonna tell my parents
that my fiance's in an African jail...

589
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,560
and that I brought home
a jungle man?

590
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:26,159
You are totally stuck
on George, huh?

591
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,959
No, I am not!

592
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,199
-Can I have him then?
-Okay, let's think. Think, think, think.

593
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,239
Think, think, think, think,
think, think, think, think.
What am I gonna do about tomorrow?

594
00:44:36,399 --> 00:44:39,159
Tomorrow is your engagement party,
and unless they give day passes...

595
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,199
out of Bujumbura Jail,
Lyle is not likely to attend.

596
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,840
So tell 'em the truth and don't
worry about it and take George.

597
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,040
- He can back up your story. Right?
- Yeah. All right.

598
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:51,159
So I'll tell my dad
first thing in the morning.

599
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,120
Make it second thing. First thing, l
suggest you buy jungle man some clothes.

600
00:44:59,399 --> 00:45:02,320
Nice butt flap.

601
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,159
Being of a conservative mind
regarding gender roles...

602
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,239
Ursula Stanhope
wasted no time...

603
00:45:12,399 --> 00:45:15,760
in taking George of the Jungle
to a fine haberdasher.

604
00:45:18,399 --> 00:45:23,439
- And this is Neiman Marcus.
- Whoo! They have big, shiny cave.

605
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,679
Hello. Would you like
to sample our new fragrance?

606
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,679
Thank you.

607
00:45:35,439 --> 00:45:39,360
Later, in the men's department, after
discovering his long-lost brothers...

608
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,879
the jungle king was pleased to find
he looked pretty good in Armani.

609
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,520
Pretty darn good.

610
00:45:48,919 --> 00:45:50,679
Watch out, man!

611
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,120
Why everyone run around crazy,
like antelope in mating season?

612
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,360
They're just trying to make a living.
It's-- different kind
of jungle here, George.

613
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,080
It's survival of the fittest.
Dog eat dog.

614
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:03,320
- "Dog eat dog"-- Dog eat dog here?
- No, that's not what I meant.

615
00:46:03,479 --> 00:46:05,360
George never bring Shep here.
Uh-uh. Never.

616
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,959
Every story gets to have a really big
coincidence, and here's ours.

617
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,280
Who should see them walking down
the street but Ursula's meddling mother?

618
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:14,360
Uh, yes, uh, Lyle Van de Groot,
please.

619
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,439
- I'm sorry. He's not back from Africa.
- He's not?

620
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,479
No. I'm sorry.

621
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:21,919
Meanwhile, back on Ape Mountain...

622
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,080
George's friends were going positively
ga-ga from missing the jungle king.

623
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:27,840
No!

624
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,040
Oh, look at this.
It's ruined. Ruined!

625
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:32,760
Shep, come here at once.

626
00:46:32,919 --> 00:46:35,639
Come on!

627
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:41,439
How many times do I have to tell you?
My violin bow is not a chew toy!

628
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,120
Bad dog!

629
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,399
And you! Out of my sight,
you feathered fool.

630
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,399
No! Not on the tree house!
I'll smack you--

631
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,280
Ursula, it's Mother.
Pick up the phone...

632
00:46:57,439 --> 00:47:00,439
and tell me who that man was
I saw you strolling with today.

633
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,439
And where is Lyle?
We must discuss the engagement party.

634
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:09,399
I know you're there, Ursula.
Pick up the phone and tell me
why you have been avoiding me.

635
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,800
Pick up the phone!

636
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:17,439
Well, I think that
was an overreaction.

637
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,959
Just make sure you stay here
while I'm at work...

638
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:25,360
and you can watch TV
and eat and relax.

639
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,719
And I'll be back as soon as I can.
Just stay here.

640
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:32,800
"Stay here"? George is king
of the jungle. No four walls built
by modern man can contain him.

641
00:47:32,959 --> 00:47:36,919
Not true. George have every intention
of doing exactly what Ursula say.

642
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,719
- Really? Is that so?
- For a while.

643
00:47:41,879 --> 00:47:47,479
And at that very moment,
Betsy and Ursula were on their way to
break the news about Lyle to her father.

644
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:50,080
- Good luck, kiddo.
- Surprise!

645
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,719
Ursula, welcome home,
sweetheart...

646
00:47:57,879 --> 00:47:59,840
and happy engagement day.

647
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,120
Chock Full O' Nuts

648
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,719
The heavenly coffee

649
00:48:05,879 --> 00:48:09,719
- The coffee that brings you together.
- When you're in love

650
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:16,280
Now George understand. George get
coffee, then Ursula want George.

651
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,679
Java-java-java-java,
java-java-java-java,
java-java-java-java.

652
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,959
So the low has moved offshore.
High pressure's built a ridge in.

653
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,120
The weather
is absolutely gorgeous.

654
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,679
- If you're not outside, you oughta be!
- Who, me?

655
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,040
- I mean you.
- Oh.

656
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:42,840
Okay!

657
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,320
And so, jazzed on java...

658
00:48:45,479 --> 00:48:48,959
George of the Jungle made his way
into the city by the bay.

659
00:48:51,399 --> 00:48:53,239
Whoo!

660
00:48:53,399 --> 00:48:55,800
Quickly taking to tourism,
the jungle king enjoyed...

661
00:48:55,959 --> 00:48:58,040
the first drive-through
dining of his life...

662
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:01,360
and strolled the city streets until
he found something so scintillating...

663
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,439
- he had to say:
- Ooh!

664
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,679
But nothing excited
the jungle king more...

665
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,639
than the sight of the biggest
rope bridge he had ever seen.

666
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,239
Ooh. Yeah.

667
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:44,000
- Help!
- Ooh.

668
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:46,000
Somebody help!

669
00:49:58,399 --> 00:50:02,199
- To swing or not to swing?
- Help!

670
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,239
Swing.

671
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:20,919
As the king of the jungle
quickly calculated the angle
and velocity of his next big swing...

672
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,800
Ursula felt like jumping
off a bridge herself.

673
00:50:23,959 --> 00:50:27,919
I feel so guilty.
I don't know what I'm going to do.

674
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,080
First thing: I suggest you tell your
father what you came here to tell him.

675
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:34,320
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, honey. Take a look at this.

676
00:50:34,479 --> 00:50:37,719
The most remarkable thing
is happening on the Bay Bridge.

677
00:50:37,879 --> 00:50:40,600
...where strong winds
have carried him to the Bay Bridge.

678
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,679
Our own Valerie Devlin
is live on the scene. Valerie?

679
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,639
Thank you, Terilyn.
We do have a breaking story...

680
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,080
- at the Bay Bridge...
- Help!
- where a parasailor dangles...

681
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:52,000
- helplessly, 500 feet above the water.
- Please! Hurry up! Help!

682
00:50:55,959 --> 00:50:58,199
There's no word on who
this lone daredevil is.

683
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,879
- That's George.
- He appears to have some kind
of rope in his hand.

684
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,080
- He might be preparing to swing on it.
- I gotta go.

685
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,120
Excuse me, sir.
I have to get on this boat.

686
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:38,560
Hey, fella. George of Jungle.
Need a vine?

687
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:42,040
Hey, thanks a lot, man.
G-Get me out of this stuff, huh?

688
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,719
- Thanks, man.
- Oh, don't mention it.

689
00:51:50,879 --> 00:51:54,679
King of jungle only here to help!

690
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,479
- George!
- Ursula! Ow!

691
00:52:23,439 --> 00:52:25,560
Watch out for that--

692
00:52:33,399 --> 00:52:35,679
- George!
- Ursula!
- What are you doing? Are you okay?

693
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,679
- You just saved that man's life!
- George just lucky, I guess.

694
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,239
Ooh. This coffee stuff
really work good.

695
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:49,080
...one of the most daring rescues
ever recorded live on television.

696
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:53,520
This is Valerie Devlin reporting
to you from under the Bay Bridge.
Back to you, Terilyn.

697
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:57,040
You know, they say the city by the bay
is the most romantic in the world...

698
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:00,120
and it looks as though
there might be a little romance
unfolding under the Bay Bridge.

699
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,959
- We'll be back in a moment.
- Ohh.

700
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,600
Meanwhile, back in the jungle--

701
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,360
There's five stinkin' apes out there.
Which one are we takin' to Vegas?

702
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,800
- The one who's playing chess.
- Checkmate.

703
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:19,879
- Yes!
- Sweet dreams, banana breath.
- Grab him!

704
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,879
Tookie. Go find George.

705
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:27,040
Tookie-Tookie.

706
00:53:34,479 --> 00:53:36,000
Thor.

707
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,199
Let's get him in the cage
while he's still under. Come on.

708
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:49,479
As the pesky poachers
grunted and groaned...

709
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:52,199
pushing and pulling
the ponderous primate along...

710
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:56,159
the trusty Tookie-Tookie bird
was already winging to the rescue...

711
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,719
making a bird-line
for San Francisco...

712
00:53:58,879 --> 00:54:02,080
where George of the Jungle was trying
to give the heiress Ursula...

713
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,159
the courage to face her parents...

714
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,040
by helping her discover
the juju within.

715
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:11,439
- Make jungle call.
Then you'll feel brave.
- No. I can't.

716
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,080
- Come on. Big breath.
Here. Support voice.
- N-No. No, no, no.

717
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:16,199
- Ursula, please? Pl-- Please?
- No, no!

718
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,520
- I can't do it.
- Big. Brave. Queen of jungle.
Come on, Ursula.

719
00:54:32,919 --> 00:54:34,840
- Wow.
- Not bad for beginner.

720
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,439
- Hi, Ursula.
- Emboldened with jungle juju...
- Hi.

721
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:42,120
Ursula Stanhope went inside
to break the news to her parents,
who took it extremely well.

722
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,080
Mother, Daddy,
I love you both very much.

723
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:48,199
I have something
very important to tell you...

724
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,560
and I hope you'll understand.

725
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:55,479
- I don't want to marry Lyle any more.
- We understand, dear.

726
00:54:58,439 --> 00:55:00,199
Just kidding.

727
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:07,800
- The young Miss Stanhope
proceeded to spill the beans...
- So, anyway, I went to the jungle--

728
00:55:07,959 --> 00:55:09,719
very quickly...

729
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,959
until she got to
the important part at the end.

730
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:25,639
Then Lyle shot him. So Lyle
is in jail and George is with me...

731
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,639
and I don't want to marry
Lyle any more.

732
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,120
I knew it. It's that swinging man
from the bridge.

733
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,040
I saw you smooching on TV.

734
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:36,120
- Mother, we weren't smooching--
- How could you do this to me?

735
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,000
Don't you realize the calibre of people
who are going to be here?

736
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:42,439
- Calm down, Beatrice, and let her say--
- I thought we would be
introducing them...

737
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,479
to Lyle Van de Groot, not some
wild man you found in the jungle.

738
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:49,120
Beatrice, this is supposed to be
her wedding, not yours.

739
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,000
- So?
- Beatrice, I know you're upset...

740
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:55,199
and so am l, but we can't force her
to marry someone against her will.

741
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,159
- Why not?
- Mom. Dad.

742
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:02,280
I'm ready to go out there
and apologize to everybody
and tell them what really happened.

743
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:04,040
Absolutely not!

744
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:07,959
As far as I'm concerned, you--
you caught one of those viruses.

745
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,479
Yes, one of those dreadful
jungle viruses...

746
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:12,679
that get nice girls all confused.

747
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:17,159
And if Lyle survives that
awful jail, you will simply
have to kiss and make up.

748
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,320
As for this evening, we will hold
our heads high and we will carry on.

749
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:25,600
Now, darling, where is that charming
young friend of yours?

750
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,320
- Well, where is he?
- I don't know.
He's around here someplace.

751
00:56:28,479 --> 00:56:31,439
- Well, find him. We haven't got
all day. Oh, Ursula, look!
- Oh, great!

752
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:36,719
How wonderful!
And look at Richard's exquisite
figurines of you and darling Lyle.

753
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,000
George, watch out for that--

754
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,919
Mom. Dad. This is George.

755
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,000
Hello, Mr and Mrs Ursula.

756
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:55,760
How do you do?

757
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,360
It is always such a pleasure
to see you, Mr Mayor.

758
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,919
And, you know, it's so nice
to get away from City Hall...

759
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,040
and be around some normal people
for a change.

760
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:23,320
Well, we are perfectly normal,
I assure you-- in an exceptional way,
of course.

761
00:57:23,479 --> 00:57:26,639
Of course.
A-And what about this guy, Lyle?

762
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,000
You know, I'd really like to meet
the man you deem good enough
to marry your daughter.

763
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:33,320
Oh, well, unfortunately Lyle
is busy at the moment...

764
00:57:33,479 --> 00:57:35,439
uh, tending to some legal affairs.

765
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:41,040
- Some pate, Mr Mayor?
- You know, I never touch that stuff.
- Oh.

766
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:43,919
- I had a lovely time.
- Would you excuse us, please?
- Excuse me, Dr Goldblum.

767
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,600
It's 7:30. Do you know where
your jungle man is?

768
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:53,199
So this is what you were doing
in the jungle. Clever girl.

769
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,679
Yeah. Um, he swung me on vines
and fed me coconut milk.

770
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,719
- I knew it.
- He's not a real meat loaf, is he?

771
00:58:00,879 --> 00:58:03,439
No. I mean,
he's not brainy...

772
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,439
in that doctor, lawyer,
banker way...

773
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,919
but he has something else.

774
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,639
- He has a--
- Sensual intelligence.

775
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,639
"Sensual intelligence."

776
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,600
- Wow.
- Oh, my God.

777
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,600
What is it with chicks
and horses, huh?

778
00:58:39,919 --> 00:58:42,800
George, how are you this evening?

779
00:58:44,879 --> 00:58:47,560
Pretty sharp threads there,
uh-- George, right?

780
00:58:47,719 --> 00:58:49,919
- Yeah. Where're you based?
- The jungle.

781
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,080
I hear ya.
We cut our teeth in New York also.

782
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:55,280
Eh, you considering a position
with Stanhope? That could be fruitful.

783
00:58:55,439 --> 00:58:58,159
Fruitful? This place not so fruitful.
Nobody here have big coconuts.

784
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,040
George.

785
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:07,760
I wa-- Oh.

786
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,719
Would you mind
stepping outside with me--

787
00:59:10,879 --> 00:59:13,000
Thank you so much--
for just a moment?

788
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:15,399
Sure.

789
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,479
- Hello, Beatrice.
- Hello, Ella.

790
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:22,600
Well, we haven't been friends
for very long, George...

791
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,120
but I already think I know
something about you.

792
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,320
- Oh?
- You are in love with my daughter.

793
00:59:30,479 --> 00:59:34,840
- Oh, Mrs Ursula not so dumb.
- George.

794
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,919
My concern, however, is that Ursula
seems to reciprocate your feelings...

795
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,520
and that does present
a problem to me.

796
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,120
You see,
you and Ursula together...

797
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,600
would be unbefitting
her social stature.

798
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,560
You see? Let me put it in a way
you might understand.

799
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:57,040
Where you come from...

800
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:00,639
zebras marry zebras
and leopards marry leopards.

801
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,439
Stripes with stripes,
spots with spots.

802
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,879
Well, Ursula is a stripe
and you are a spot...

803
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:11,959
one which I intend to have removed
as soon as possible.

804
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,639
So you no want Ursula
to love George.

805
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,159
I would rather have my tongue nailed to
this table every morning at breakfast.

806
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,760
- That hurt.
- Not as much as you will
if you do anything...

807
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:24,520
to screw up my daughter's marriage
to Lyle Van de Groot.

808
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:28,520
When Lyle returns, this wedding
will proceed as planned.

809
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:32,120
If you do anything to upset that...

810
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,840
I will remove your reason
for wearing a loin cloth.

811
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,840
Steak tartare, Mrs Stanhope?

812
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,199
Oh, no, no. Thank you.
I've had quite enough protein for today.

813
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,959
Have a pleasant evening,
Mr Jungle.

814
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:12,080
Tookie? Tookie!

815
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:16,719
Tookie.
George so happy to see Tookie.

816
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,800
Ape kidnapped?
Ape ape-napped?

817
01:01:24,959 --> 01:01:27,199
George save Ape!

818
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:31,159
Ursula.

819
01:02:24,439 --> 01:02:28,360
Well, of course he went back to the
jungle. Where else would go-- the Hague?

820
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,479
But why would he leave
without saying goodbye?

821
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:34,360
Well, personally I think he acted
rather sensibly. Showed good character.

822
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:37,679
He understands that he belongs there,
you belong here.

823
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:41,080
It's really all a question
of stripes and spots.

824
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:44,159
What? Oh, no.

825
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,760
You got to him.
Mother, what did you say?

826
01:02:46,919 --> 01:02:49,719
I simply said that if he
really cared for you...

827
01:02:49,879 --> 01:02:53,959
he'd leave you alone and let you
get on with your life and marry Lyle.

828
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,679
- I am not marrying Lyle, Mother.
- Beatrice, perhaps we should just--

829
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,679
Arthur! Now, Ursula darling,
don't be ridiculous.

830
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:03,360
There's a big difference
between marriageable material
and a fling in the jungle.

831
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,280
"A fling in the jungle"?
"A fling in the jungle."

832
01:03:06,439 --> 01:03:08,320
Who says I had
a fling in the jungle?

833
01:03:08,479 --> 01:03:11,120
You don't think you can
fool your mother, do you?

834
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,560
You've been head over heels for that ape
ever since you brought him here.

835
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:19,600
Now, Ursula, that kind of love
is fleeting. You'll get over it.

836
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:29,560
- Did you just say "love"?
- No.

837
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:31,520
- You did.
- Ursula.
- You're right.

838
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:34,239
- Don't say it.
- I love him. I'm outta here.

839
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:38,080
Ursula, you can't love him.
Arthur, say something.

840
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:40,239
- Be careful out there, honey.
- What?

841
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,600
- Goodbye, Daddy.
- I love you.

842
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,120
- Wha--
- I love you, Mom. Thank you.

843
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,159
- Ursula-- Arthur, do something!
- What would you have me do?

844
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,439
- There's obviously no stopping her.
- Oh, God.

845
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:59,560
- Ursula!
- God, that woman's a pain in the ass.

846
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:04,080
Meanwhile,
halfway across the world...

847
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:06,280
another ass was feeling pain...

848
01:04:06,439 --> 01:04:09,000
as an ape named Ape
was caged in a cage...

849
01:04:09,159 --> 01:04:11,719
hoping to hear
the jungle king's awesome--

850
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:19,159
Hey, I'm pretty good at that--

851
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,199
and wondering
if he would ever come.

852
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,479
But the motion-sick mammal
needn't have moaned...

853
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:26,360
for that defender of the innocent,
protector of the weak...

854
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,760
and all-around good guy
George of the Jungle...

855
01:04:29,919 --> 01:04:32,280
was closer than he knew.

856
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,679
Next time George get bigger box.

857
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,600
Oh! Bad luck.

858
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,560
- Did you hear something?
- What?

859
01:05:45,719 --> 01:05:48,080
- I heard a noise.
- Shut up and push!

860
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,399
Oh, I think I chipped a tooth.

861
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,639
- Oh, Thor, you're disgusting.
- God, that wasn't me.

862
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,439
Not me.

863
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,760
- I'm hungry.
- Oh, shut up.

864
01:06:28,919 --> 01:06:31,360
You've been yakkin' for 2 days straight,
and I'm gettin' mad enough to--

865
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,679
You know, you really should
work on your anger.

866
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:37,439
Have you tried Brankowski's
"Cage the Rage" technique?

867
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,959
Don't let him get to you, Thor.
He's just an ape.

868
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,679
That's a fine way to talk
to your meal ticket.

869
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,360
You keep that up, it's liable
to affect my stage performance.

870
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,000
Give him a banana, Thor.
It won't be long now.

871
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:50,120
That's what you said yesterday.

872
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,199
This trail's taking us
to the middle of nowhere.

873
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,639
The sign at the trail head said
"Short cut to Ape River."

874
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:59,120
Now, why would it say "short cut"
if it wasn't a--

875
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,760
Wait a minute.
Maybe it's a fake, a decoy trail.

876
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:07,040
Very good, Max.
Actually, the trail is a fake.

877
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:12,040
It circles Ape Mountain six times before
heading right back to the tree house.

878
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:16,120
- Ohh! Oh, I knew we was lost.
- Don't listen to him, Thor.

879
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,439
He's just tryin' to trick us,
lead us off the short cut...

880
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,280
so we take twice as long
on the regular trail.

881
01:07:21,439 --> 01:07:23,560
We're already taking twice as long!

882
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:26,520
Are you gonna let a monkey
make a monkey out of ya?

883
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:29,320
- What?
- Duh!

884
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:34,159
Let's go. If he tells us the short cut
leads to the tree house...

885
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,159
then that's exactly
where it doesn't lead.

886
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:48,479
Ape?

887
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,760
- Poor ape-napped brother.
- Careful.

888
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,040
Max, look.
We're back at the tree house.

889
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:21,680
Well, I tried, but you fellas
are just too smart for me.

890
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:25,759
- Oh, no!
- "Oh, no" was right,
for the exhausted ape-nappers had--

891
01:08:25,919 --> 01:08:29,799
Hey! Why don't you say something
constructive for a change,
like what we should do now.

892
01:08:29,959 --> 01:08:33,560
-Because I don't like you.
-Well, I hate you, you snotty son of a--

893
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:38,040
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
Having some fun now, hmm?

894
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,799
- Thor, were you fighting
with the narrator?
- Well, he started it.

895
01:08:40,959 --> 01:08:42,399
- Did not.
- You did too!

896
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,200
- Did not.
- You did too!
- Did not!

897
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:45,919
- You did too!
- Thor, stop it!
- Ohh.

898
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,560
That's it. I'm not draggin'
this thing another inch.

899
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,919
- What are you doing? Get back there
and work. Where are you going?
- You wretched little weasel.

900
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,799
Aren't you the little weasel,
you big brontosaurus?

901
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:02,520
- Let's take care of him.
- Huh? Huh?

902
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:06,359
Whoa!
Why didn't you come sooner?

903
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,959
Why Ape have little stars
around head?

904
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:15,680
George, remember
everything I taught you about
Queensberry rules and fighting fair?

905
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:18,200
- Uh-huh.
- Well, now's a good time to forget it.

906
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:20,399
Let's finish him off.

907
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:28,680
- Oh, I can't breathe, Max.
- Let it out, Thor. Let it out.

908
01:09:34,959 --> 01:09:37,759
Right, jungle boy.

909
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:54,839
- Huh?
- Huh?

910
01:10:25,799 --> 01:10:27,479
Tookie-Tookie!

911
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,279
- Take this!
- Stop it! Ape!

912
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:49,879
Get it off!
Get it off of me, Max!

913
01:11:05,879 --> 01:11:08,720
All right!

914
01:11:08,879 --> 01:11:11,319
Shep, look out!

915
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,640
Ursula?

916
01:11:20,799 --> 01:11:23,600
George good teacher.

917
01:11:26,439 --> 01:11:31,279
George. George.
I came all this way to tell you that--

918
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:34,359
Ursula talk later.
George busy now.

919
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:38,399
- What?
- Fella got toucan on can.

920
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,799
I know.

921
01:12:02,759 --> 01:12:06,040
Good show, George.
And you too, Tookie.

922
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,240
Oh, my hero.

923
01:12:09,399 --> 01:12:11,720
Did I just say that?

924
01:12:11,879 --> 01:12:16,080
- George. Over here, George!
- Ape, sit tight. George be right back.

925
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,839
Oh, I say.

926
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,879
Now George can talk.
What Ursula come back to say?

927
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:35,879
Only that I know in my heart...

928
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:40,000
that I really, truly--

929
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:43,080
- Haven't seen the light yet.
- Lyle.

930
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,160
- Lyle?
- Yes, Lyle.

931
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:48,160
For the venal Van de Groot had escaped
from the Bujumbura jail...

932
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:51,399
and joined an obscure cult
on the shores of Lake Tanganyika...

933
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:54,160
which had empowered him with
a peculiar piece of parchment.

934
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:57,919
- What are you doing here?
- Surprised, my little cupcake?

935
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,000
You see, I'm now
an mail-order minister...

936
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:04,479
ordained the Church of Celestial
Power and Light, Incorporated...

937
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:09,000
capable of performing legally binding
marriage ceremonies anywhere.

938
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,959
- Lyle, I'm not marrying you.
- Actually, you are.

939
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,439
- Come on, let's go.
Come along, my little African queen.
- George.

940
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,040
Now George really mad.
George tear off your--

941
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:23,319
- At ease, jungle boy.
- Everybody freeze now!

942
01:13:23,479 --> 01:13:25,640
Operation completed
as ordered, sir.

943
01:13:25,799 --> 01:13:30,240
Thank you, Gunnar, Gunter,
Hans, Jan and Phil.

944
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,919
No hard feelings, stone belly.

945
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,120
The best man won.
That's all.

946
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:39,919
I should say, the guy who brought
mercenaries won. That's all.

947
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,439
Okay, honey, you ready to go? I got
a boat waitin' to take us to Bujumbura.

948
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,160
- Come on.
- George!
- Ursula.

949
01:13:45,319 --> 01:13:47,200
- Come on.
- No!
- Don't go that way!

950
01:13:47,359 --> 01:13:50,200
- Go that way. No--
- See you later.

951
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:55,040
- George! Stop it! Stop it!
- Ursula!

952
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:59,080
- Lyle, let go of me.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

953
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:29,560
Bongo-gram!
Work every time.

954
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:33,640
Good work, brother apes.
Now listen very carefully to George.

955
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,160
Let 'er rip, Shep.

956
01:14:48,879 --> 01:14:52,560
Stop it! Stop it, Lyle!

957
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:56,080
- Come on.
- Let go. Stop it! You're such a jerk!

958
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:02,479
Come on in there!
Come here!

959
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,600
You know, I forgive you, and I'm
willing to give you yet another chance.

960
01:15:06,759 --> 01:15:10,120
Lyle, you don't where you're go--

961
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,160
Where's George?

962
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,279
You see? I told you
I'd have a boat waiting.

963
01:16:06,959 --> 01:16:10,279
Okay, then. All righty.

964
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:13,240
Reverend Lyle
ready to perform the ceremony.

965
01:16:13,399 --> 01:16:17,200
Do you, Ursula Stanhope,
take me, Lyle Van de Groot...

966
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:20,359
- to be your lawful wedded husband?
- Get a grip, Lyle.

967
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,879
- Lyle.
- Yeah, honey?

968
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,080
- Lyle?
- Oh, my God!

969
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:51,080
Lyle!

970
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,040
Tookie-Tookie!

971
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:00,000
Thanks, Tookie.

972
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:04,319
This biggest swing
in jungle history.

973
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:07,720
Will hurt very much,
but George have to do it.

974
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:45,399
- George!
- What the--

975
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:54,759
- This gonna hurt.
- George, watch out for that tree!

976
01:17:58,879 --> 01:18:02,680
George not feel so good.

977
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:21,319
Oh, thank God we've made it.
Say "l do," Ursula.

978
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:25,319
Ah, that's it. We're married.
Now to look at my bride.

979
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,479
No!

980
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:38,240
No! No!

981
01:18:39,759 --> 01:18:45,399
George, what I came here to say
was that I love you.

982
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:51,000
- Ursula love George?
- So much.

983
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:54,359
George love Ursula too.

984
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:58,959
And so George of the Jungle received
the first kiss of his life...

985
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,520
that came from
neither elephant nor ape.

986
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:05,319
And on the following new moon...

987
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:09,200
Ursula Stanhope finally got
the simple wedding she had hoped for...

988
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:11,959
as the San Francisco heiress
and the king of the jungle...

989
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:15,879
joined their hearts forever
in wedded bliss.

990
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:21,279
- The rings!
- The rings.

991
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:23,359
The rings? Tookie.

992
01:19:26,959 --> 01:19:29,080
Tookie.

993
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:49,000
Arthur, I wish you'd do something
about all these monkeys.

994
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,439
I feel like Jane Goodall.

995
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:56,600
Madam, I knew Jane Goodall,
and you are no Jane Goodall.

996
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,959
Listenin' to some inner call

997
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:16,040
Swimmin' blindly
to throw myself upon your shore

998
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,479
I think I know why
the dog howls at the moon

999
01:20:20,759 --> 01:20:24,240
I think I know why
the dog howls at the moon

1000
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:29,160
And I sing, dela, dela

1001
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,200
When I'm with you

1002
01:20:40,439 --> 01:20:43,479
I burn for you

1003
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,879
I been waiting for you
all my life

1004
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,720
Hoping for a miracle

1005
01:20:47,879 --> 01:20:50,000
I been waiting day and night

1006
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,479
Day and night

1007
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,000
I been waiting for you
all my life

1008
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,799
Waiting for redemption

1009
01:20:56,959 --> 01:20:58,799
I been waiting day and night

1010
01:20:58,959 --> 01:21:01,200
I burn for you

1011
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:07,520
- I love you.
- Good boy.

1012
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:11,040
And so ends our tale
of that defender of the innocent...

1013
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,319
protector of the weak
and all-around good guy...

1014
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:17,040
George of the Jungle.

1015
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,720
A noble king,
his beautiful queen...

1016
01:21:19,879 --> 01:21:22,359
and their nimble young heir
to the jungle throne.

1017
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:25,080
George, watch out for that--

1018
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,879
I know what you're thinking--
How does a baby raised by an ape...

1019
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:32,359
grow up to be king of the jungle,
find his queen...

1020
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,000
and live happily ever after?

1021
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,200
George just lucky, I guess.

1022
01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:41,359
George, George
George of the Jungle

1023
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,520
Strong as he can be

1024
01:21:45,879 --> 01:21:47,839
Watch out for that tree

1025
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,040
George, George
George of the Jungle

1026
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,120
Lives a life that's free

1027
01:21:52,279 --> 01:21:56,600
Wait a moment! Wait, wait, wait! Don't
you want to know what happened to me?

1028
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:13,120
And now the end is near

1029
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:16,720
And so I face the final curtain

1030
01:22:16,879 --> 01:22:20,120
My friends
I'll say it clear

1031
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:23,680
I'll state my case
Of which I'm certain

1032
01:22:23,839 --> 01:22:26,879
I've lived a life that's full

1033
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:30,240
I've travelled
each and every highway

1034
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:34,000
- And more, much more than this
- Whoo

1035
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:37,279
I did it my way
Yes!

1036
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:40,560
There were times
I'm sure you knew

1037
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:44,040
When I bit off
more than I could chew

1038
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,640
But through it all

1039
01:22:45,799 --> 01:22:47,240
- When there was doubt
- Doubt

1040
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:51,279
I ate it up and spit it out

1041
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:54,359
I faced it all
and I stood tall

1042
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:58,560
And did it my way

1043
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,040
Doo, doo, doo

1044
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:06,479
George, George
George of the Jungle

1045
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,640
Strong as he can be

1046
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,959
Watch out for that tree

1047
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,120
George, George
George of the Jungle

1048
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:17,359
Lives a life that's free

1049
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,240
Watch out for that tree

1050
01:23:21,399 --> 01:23:23,439
When he gets in a scrape
he makes his escape

1051
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,720
With help from his friend
an ape named Ape

1052
01:23:26,879 --> 01:23:28,959
And his elephant Shep
can fetch a log

1053
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,680
He's man's best friend
He's George's dog

1054
01:23:31,839 --> 01:23:34,520
He's George, George
George of the Jungle

1055
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,680
Strong as he can be

1056
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,919
Watch out for that tree

1057
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,080
George, George
George of the Jungle

1058
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,240
Friend to you and me

1059
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,479
Watch out for that tree

1060
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,399
Hear him holler
Swing and sing

1061
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:54,720
All the animals come
to the jungle king

1062
01:23:54,879 --> 01:23:56,919
So grab a vine
and swing in time

1063
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,640
If you slam a tree
just pay no mind

1064
01:23:59,799 --> 01:24:02,560
Like George, George
George of the Jungle

1065
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,640
George, George
George of the Jungle

1066
01:24:04,799 --> 01:24:06,839
George, George
George of the Jungle

1067
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,959
George, George
George of the Jungle

1068
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,160
George, George
George of the Jungle

1069
01:24:11,319 --> 01:24:13,279
George, George
George of the Jungle

1070
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:15,439
George, George
George of the Jungle

1071
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,520
George, George
George of the Jungle

1072
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,720
George, George
George of the Jungle

1073
01:24:19,879 --> 01:24:21,879
George, George
George of the Jungle

1074
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,919
George, George
George of the Jungle

1075
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,080
George, George
George of the Jungle

1076
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,200
George, George
George of the Jungle

1077
01:24:28,359 --> 01:24:30,399
Swing from tree to tree

1078
01:24:32,799 --> 01:24:34,759
Watch out for that tree

1079
01:24:34,919 --> 01:24:36,959
George, George
George of the Jungle

1080
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,120
Lives a life that's free

1081
01:24:41,439 --> 01:24:43,359
Watch out for that tree

1082
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,879
Left in the wild was a baby
with a smile named George

1083
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,520
Who stayed for quite a while

1084
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,720
And George grew up
in the trees above

1085
01:24:50,879 --> 01:24:53,839
When Ursula found him
they found love

1086
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,120
She took him to the city
Took him straight downtown

1087
01:24:56,279 --> 01:24:59,240
But the concrete bliss
brought poor George down

1088
01:24:59,399 --> 01:25:01,439
So it's back to the jungle
for a wedding in the green

1089
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,520
For the king and queen
of the animal scene

1090
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,000
George, George
George of the Jungle

1091
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:10,160
Strong as he can be

1092
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,560
Watch out for that tree

1093
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:18,399
Watch out for that--
Bang! Ooh! Tree

1094
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,640
George, George
George of the Jungle

1095
01:25:28,799 --> 01:25:30,439
Watch out for that tree

1096
01:27:48,919 --> 01:27:51,640
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the king of the jungle.
