where l pimp the kids

16
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,383
ln fact, l have two

17
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,427
And they are
just one tabIe away

18
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,429
from one of my tricks.

19
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,557
Now I know you'Ve probabIy
got about 20 questions

20
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,976
right on the tip
of your tongue.

21
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,606
WeII, if you must know,

22
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,234
then Iet us begin.

23
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,424
Sam!

24
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,136
Over here.

25
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,557
Sam, you have been kicked out

26
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,725
of a couple of Very prominent

27
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,686
boarding schooIs in this country.

28
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,856
- Okay, yes, but about that--
- Stop.

29
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,652
I read your transcripts.
You'Ve got a 3.87

30
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,988
three years and running.

31
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,699
You've got some kick-ass
writing sampIes to boot.

32
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,119
You aIso cIearIy have
a probIem with authority.

33
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,746
And it just
makes my mind wonder,

34
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,709
"What exactly
am I in for here, Sam?"

35
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,752
Okay, noted.

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,380
But here is the thing:

37
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:57,384
I wasn't exactly kicked out
of all my schools per se.

38
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:01,597
I am somebody that you would
consider a victim of, um...

39
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,016
- Circumstances?
- Circumstances, yes.

40
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,767
And you know what?
Most peopIe don't believe it,

41
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,728
but...

42
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,272
I've journaIed about it, man.
You can read it if you want.

43
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,816
Just give me the CIiff Notes.
Summarize, Sam.

' Hey baby bIue, put your feet
on the ground '

47
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,918
' Feet on the ground '

48
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,253
' Let your head spin around '

00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,422

forget about the moon '

50
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,507
' TeII me not to Ieave
not a day too soon '

51
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,427
' Donkey see, donkey do,
I don't wanna go to schooI '

52
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,724
' Danke, try to make my day,
l don't wanna participate '

53
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,102
' Yeah '

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,570
' Hey baby bIue,
put your feet on the ground '

55
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,156
' Feet on the ground,
Iet your head spin around '

56
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,700

58
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,331
' Donkey see, donkey do,

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,752
- Mom.
- Sam?

60
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,046
That's tough.

61
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,840
Nah, you know, it's just kinda...

62
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,595
par for the course
when your mom's an ex-PIaymate.

63
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,724
WeII put.

64
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,393
I know your mom.

65
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,687
Hmm?
ReaIIy?

66
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,314
You know, Sam,
she's a nice Iady.

67
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,276
Batshit crazy,
but she's a good chick.

68
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,528
So is that you?

69
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,031
That, my friend,
was the EIiminator tour.

70
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,619
Eight years of more pussy
than any one man couId ever handIe...

71
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,999
which, by the way,
is why you shouId wear a rubber.

72
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,252
Or you'II find yourseIf
knocking up the wrong groupie

73
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,547
and trading in your dream

74
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,882
of a harmonica soIo
with Billy Gibbons

75
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,803
to become the headmaster
of a private academy.

76
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,808
But...

77
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,811
I Iove my daughter.

78
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,439
She taught me
how to respect women.

79
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,943
Or some shit like that.
You ready for the $5 tour?

80
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,910
This is our history department.
lan, get off that cell phone.

81
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,871
Oh good.
'Cause I'm a history nut.

82
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,874
I'm a reaIIy big fan
of the French RevoIution,

83
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,625
especiaIIy NapoIeon.

84
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,836
They're very tasty.
Have you ever had one?

85
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,340
So you're a writer and a dick?

86
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,508
I'd be carefuI of your roomie here.

87
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,761
I hear he's a bit of a strange bird,

88
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,763
Iikes to whip out the fifi bag

89
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,681
when the Iights go down.

90
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,558
What is a fifi bag?

91
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,268
Bukowski term.

92
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,145
What is a Bukowski?

93
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,606
A Bukowski?

94
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,317
WeII, it's not a Rusty Trombone

95
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,236
or a Gorilla Mask.
A Bukowski is a writer.

96
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,280
A poet?

97
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,741
Come on.
"Notes from a Dirty OId Man"?

98
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,785
"Ham on Rye"?
"Post Office"?

99
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,661
Hm-mm.

100
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,497
WeII,

101
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,416
it's good you're continuing your education.
You came to the right pIace.

102
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,796
You keep your GPA up,

103
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,839
no swearing within earshot,

104
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,175
and stay out of troubIe,

105
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,219
so I can keep you

106
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,221
from getting your ass
kicked out this go around.

107
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,264
Capisce?

108
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,308
Yeah, of course.

109
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,976
PIus, how much mayhem
could l possibly cause

110
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,813
in a school that's got
tea cozies on the waII?

111
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,857
' Eff that,
take the radio back '

112
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,901

115
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,992

' HeIIo, C Young

120
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,754
' She ain't a Kimora Simmons,
but the baby is phat! '

121
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,965
' And l keep
my cranium packed '

122
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,217
' With more Uranium than

123
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,136
Hey!

124
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,097
Knock it off.

125
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,600
Look, I can expIain.

126
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,977
- You know what? Sir, I can expIain.
- Shawn and his friends

127
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,770
- tried to smoke us again.
- lt wasn't his fault.

128
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,314
- You caIIed me Snoop, racist.
- That's a Iie.

129
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,733
You said degrading stuff
about my stature, dipshit--

130
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,945
- l mean, Shawn.
- Sir, it's true. He started it.

131
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,240
- Shawn.
- What?

132
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,994
Come on. You're not actuaIIy gonna
buy this side of the story, are you?

133
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,830
You're teasing and fighting
with the new kid aIready?

134
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,957
And you wonder why
you're a fifth-year senior.

135
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,709
- Dan--
- Sir!

136
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,544
Sir.

137
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,213
He waIked in, we were hanging out,
he punched me in the face.

138
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,257
BIame is the first sign
of weakness.

139
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,887
Now apoIogize.

140
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,055
- Fuck that.
- Fuck that?!

141
00:07:56,058 --> 00:08:00,937
Headmaster?
Language? Demerits?

142
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,106
Does any of that ring
a goddamn beII to you?

143
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,025
This is buIIshit.

144
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,902
Tuck in that damn shirt

145
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,570
and be in my office
in 10 minutes.

146
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,742
Come here.

147
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,582
WeII, you do haVe a string
of bad luck, don't you?

148
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,959
- That's the worst kid I got.
- I toId you.

149
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,003
Yeah?

150
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,047
WeII, why don't we try
to change that now?

151
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,757
That's a good idea.

152
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,176
Go make some new friends.

153
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,096
Now.

154
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,684
Sam.
Sam, thank you so much.

155
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,728
You are our savior.
I'm not gonna Iie to you.

156
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,939
That guy's such a douche.
He does that aII the time.

157
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,357
We shouId hang out sometime.

158
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,526
By the way, l'm Jimmy.
This is Chuck. This is Teddy.

159
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,320
Where are you from? I'm having
a hard time, but I'm thinking it's Manhattan.

160
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,239
I'm getting this tri-state area
kind of thing. New York?

161
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,157
Yeah, it's New York
with that handshake that you're doing.

162
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,327
Okay, caIm down.
Look, it's good to meet you guys

163
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,995

the camaraderie

164
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,665
in front of the headmaster

165
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,083

00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,876
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
For sure. No worries.

167
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,504
Um, thank you.

168
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,507
And just in case
you want to know--

169
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,176
Iike when you reaIize that this pIace

171
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,179

172
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,099

It's actuaIIy surprising.
I thought it wouId take Ionger.

188
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,101
You want to partake in some
recreationaI substance abuse?

189
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,145
I got some Scotch--
single malt.

190
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,689
- Go for it, bro.

191
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,322
So stoned.

00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,378
'cause Jesus Christ absoIution
is just mere steps away.

196
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,218
Oh, but seriousIy.

197

Don't act Iike you're surprised.
You know me.

00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,037

208
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,206
- Ouch.

209
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,417

213
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,594
Dick.

214
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,055
So what's there
to do around here?

215
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,978
So this is Main Street, huh?

216
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,147
Yup.
Open weekend--

00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,171
Oh, come on, Chuck.

Oh my God,

00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,893
So now that we've got the
pIeasantries out of the way,

243
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,686
do you care to sit down
and join us for a Iatte?

244
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,231
- Yeah.
- Great.

245
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,067
- I'm Courtney.
- Hi.

246
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,986
And this is Angie.
And you are...?

247
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,863
Uh, Sam.

248
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,241
- WeII, nice to meet you, Sam.

249
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,076
Hi.

WeII, what are you doing

251
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,748

252
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,667
l'm just kind of
hanging out with my friends.

253
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,211
Oh, you have friends.

254
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,090
WeII, that's noveI.

255
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,425
AII my friends are dead
if you were wondering.

256
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,386
WeII, except for her,

257
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,304
but she's not reaIIy a friend
so I guess that doesn't count.

258
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,348
- Thanks, bitch.
- l love you.

259
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,058

Fine. Fine.

269
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,793
Okay, bye.

270
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,630

271
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,966

Why you going so soon?

272
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,343
We're just-- just starting to
haVe so much fun.

273
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,514
It's my mom-- she's crazy and she spit

274
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,433

00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,856
That's-- he's funny.

00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,317
You're cute too.

278
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,570
AII right. I'm thoroughIy bored

279
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,530

- Phone, please.
- I'm sorry. What?

286
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,549
So I can put my number in it
so we can make plans.

287
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,967
Do you haVe Asperger's
or something?

288
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,345
l don't know
what's wrong with you.

289
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,472
WeII, I just don't think
we're at the swapping--

290
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,309
swapping digits phase yet.
It's aII moving a IittIe fast for me.

291
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,353
Oh, l see.
It's so fast.

292
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,856
WeII then, no number for you.
WeII done, prince charming.

293
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,942

00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,363
Wait two seconds.
Jesus, Angie.

296
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,406
Hi. Sorry.
Here here.

297
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,784
- You sure?

298
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,707
- Bye.

299
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,341
Nice fucking work, dude.

300
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,718
- WiII you be my mentor?
- That'll be nice.

301
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,554
- That was amazing.
- Okay, Iet's not jump on him aII at once.

302
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,431
Let's have some coffee
Iike some ciViIized peopIe.

303
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,643
- You don't even drink coffee.
- 'Cause it tastes like shit.

304
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,438
"And so l return
to the question at hand.

305
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,984
Do we resign ourseIves
to the sad truth

306
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,987
that our existence is pureIy
an exercise in human foIIy?

307
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:33,741
Or do we embrace every moment
of that existence

308
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,577
and forget about what it might
amount to one day?"

309
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,580
Now we all know
what Camus thinks--

310
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,374
It's fucking "Cammuss."
Crazy, right?

311
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,209
- It's Camus, you idiot.
- lt is?

312
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,545
Do you guys eVer read?

313
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,588
Sam?

314
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,884
- Hey.
- Hey.

315
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,053
Uh, uh, sit down.

316
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,348
Uh, yeah.
In a second.

317
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,058
l've got to tell you
something, though.

318
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,269
I, um...

319
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,732
met a girI.

320
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,775
And one that's not
in a straitjacket,

321
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,610
which is a pretty big
improvement for me.

322
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,113
- Sam.
- And then

323
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,282
I'm actuaIIy pretty sure
I compIeteIy aced

324
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,368
my Iiterature presentation

325
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,162
thanks to your
recommended reading.

326
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,747
- I'm going out on the streets with this...
- Sam.

327
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,332
...'cause l had no idea that
French-Moroccan existentiaIism

328
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,501
could be just
so damn fascinating.

329
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,171
Sam, I just got off the phone.

330
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:31,340
Your mother can't pay
for your schooI anymore.

331
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,600
We had a good run.

332
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,439
You know, you were, uh--

333
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,524
you were cooI,
my friends were cooI.

334
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,945
I got a IittIe Bukowski
out of it,

335
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,614
but I guess at the end
of the day,

336
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,116
eVen my mom's tits
aren't recession-proof.

337
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,369
Yeah.

338
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,430
Come on, man.
I Ieft my ID in my room.

339
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,848
l don't feel like

340
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,393

- Nice try, junior.

341
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,354
He's with me.

342
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,651
Yeah, I-- I'm with her.

343
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,655
That's why I don't have my ID,
because I Ieft it in our room.

344
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,699
So how about you
just pour me that drink?

345
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,246
WhiIe you're at it,
you can refiII hers

346
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,290
and when you're done, you can bring it

347
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,838
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

348
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,925

353
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,656
- I'm AIison.
- Good to meet you, AIison.

354
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,952
Rough night?

355
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,168
Gotcha.

356
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,920
- Me too.
- Yeah.

357
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,721
My husband's mistress

358
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,472
showed up
at my house tonight

359
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,685
to compIain to me about
how he's cheating on her tonight.

360
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,354
S-s-shit.

361
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,690
l mean, l'm sure
that he can expIain.

362
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,902
He's reaIIy good at expIaining.

363
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,196
He's a very good expIainer.

364
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,780
- Like, he couId've expIained--
- Yes, okay. Right, Iook,

365
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,824
- Okay, here we go.
- --that I was married--

366
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,743
Why don't we do this?
Why don't we do this?

367
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,286
Your husband's
a fucking asshoIe.

368
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,371
Okay?
I wouId...

369
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,963
I mean, what?
He goes out

370
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,799
and he cheats on you?

371
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,468
Twice?

372
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,430
And then he fuckin'
tries to explain?

373
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,266
What are you taIking about?
Who the heII cheats on you?

374
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,812
I mean, Iook at you.
You're beautifuI.

375
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,356
You'Ve got these eyes,
they sparkle.

376
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,566
They're Iike diamonds,
you know?

377
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,153
God, what?

378
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,281
That was reaIIy bad.

379
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,663
That just...

380
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,375
- won't sound genuine.
- Oh good.

381
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,503
No, it's a good thing.

382
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:04,220
So... so you go to school
around here or something?

383
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,433
Yeah, kinda.

384
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,561
- Kinda.
- Kinda?

385
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,192
How oId are you, Sam?

386
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,907

387
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,452
Yeah, I shouId probabIy

388
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,496
get out of here
and get going.

389
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,290
You probabIy shouId.

390
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,293
I'II buy you another drink.

391
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,713
My husband probably
shouIdn't haVe cheated on me.

392
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,050
- Twice.
- Twice.

393
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,971
So...

394
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,017
- So...
- So...

395
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,609

396
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,613
Just teII RiIey

397
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,407
Okay?

398
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,450
Okay. Bye.

399
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,172
Is this creepy?

400
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,634
Creepy?

401
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,303
This is freaking amazing.

402
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,478
This is crazy.

403
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,732
I'm not that oId,
you know.

404
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,484
I'm not that young.

405
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,029
TechnicaIIy I'm not even
a senior anymore

406
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:12,158
because I can't pay
for my tuition.

407
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,663
This is fun, right?

408
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,623
Yeah.

409
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,834
This is fun.

410
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,422
You haVe an amazing ass.

411
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:32,011
So hey, you wanna
have fun again?

412
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,054
AbsoIuteIy.

413
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,015
I couId have fun aII night.

414
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,933
- I bet you can.
- l can.

415
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,227
- Good.
- Great.

416
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,188
- Less taIking, more doing.
- Okay.

417
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,757
AII right, so Iet me
get this straight.

418
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,884
This chick was hot,

419
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,928
brought you to her suite,
got you drunk,

420
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,513
had sex with you
multiple times

421
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,933
and Ieft you with a fucking
check in the morning?

422
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,935
Yeah.

423
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,479
That's fucking amazing. Why don't shit
like that ever happen to me, Jimmy?

424
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,148
It can.
It can.

425
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,151
Yeah.
Sam, she's got friends, right?

426
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,696
- Yeah, she's got friends.
- And you haVe money probIems.

427
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,281
- Yes, I haVe money probIems.
- Okay, so?

428
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,534
- So what?
- So hook it up.

429
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,577
Dude, it's not
what you think.

430
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,121
l don't even know
if I'm gonna caII this girI again.

431
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,873
Okay, this is Iike
a once-in-a-Iifetime thing.

432
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,250
Yeah, or Iike
a once-in-a-week time thing.

433
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,126
- You fuckin' know it.
- You know what I mean?

434
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,170
Guys, stop.
Come on.

435
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,632
Look, if you haVen't
already guessed it,

436
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,218
- I'm a Virgin, okay?
- Yeah, l know.

437
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,638
$500 is good.
I get it, okay?

438
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,473
l don't know
what you did with it,

439
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,142
but the fact
of the matter is

440
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,144
if we could parlay that
into two grand a week,

441
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,856
Sam, we couId pay for your tuition
in two months or less.

442
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,568
Like that. You couId stay in schooI
and we couId aII hang out again.

443
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:14,071
Plus we'd be bringing joy to
unhappiIy-married women eVerywhere.

444
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,949
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- Yes!

445
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,201
And Teddy, by the way,
great VaIid point.

446
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,536
SeIfIess-- I Iike
where your head's at.

447
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,121
- Thank you, sir.
- He made a vaIid point.

448
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,123
I'm just saying.
The fact of the matter is

449
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,166
there are probabIy
tons-- tons

450
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,210
of smoking hot miIfs

451
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,254
waiting for some young
guiIt-free kieIbasa.

452
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,007
AII you haVe to do is make the connection,
pimp this shit out

453
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,551
and it's done. It's a fuckin' wrap--
bills on you.

454
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,971
You want to lay in bills?
You want to take a bath in biIIs?

455
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,057
Okay, couId you pIease stop Iistening
in on our fucking conversation?

456
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,101
l'm sorry.
It just sounds awesome.

457
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,436
I mean, if you ever
need any heIp...

458
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,937
Yeah yeah, sure.
We'II giVe you a fuckin' caII.

459
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,939
Just stop Iooking at me.

460
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,276
So...

461
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,829
Hey, do you think
we can carve out

462
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,873
a IittIe bit to do
a schoIarship for a kid

463
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,416
who's having some
financiaI probIems?

464
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,794
- What?
- WeII, you said we had a IittIe extra.

465
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,005
WeII, not entireIy extra.

466
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,590
It's for Sam LoweII.

467
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:18,510
We're a boarding schooI,
not a commune.

468
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,138
I think we shouId concentrate
on the kids that are aIready here

469
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,933
as opposed to some charity case
you might want to bring in.

470
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,895
Bruce, this is not
a charity case.

471
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,105
AII right?
This is a good kid.

472
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,191
I mean, what do you think
we do here as teachers?

473
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,026
We're here to inspire.

474
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,403
WeII, I'm aII for inspiring,

475
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,947
but we're in a recession.

476
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,991
- I know that.
- I can't eVen get enough money

477
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,660
for new band instruments.

478
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:47,164
Coach Jackson wants new turf
for his Iacrosse fieId.

479
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,000
I'd Iike a IittIe money
for my Women's Lib program.

480
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,835
What do they need
to know about women?

481
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,797
You teII the good-Iooking
ones they're smart

482
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,216
and you teII the smart ones
they're good-Iooking.

483
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,093
Look, I'm trying to have
a decent conversation--

484
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,262
This is a conversation.
You're not listening.

485
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,973
- Sir?
- What is it, Cy, what?!

486
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,267
Sam LoweII is back
on campus.

487
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,061
He says he can pay
for his tuition.

488
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,357
HeIIo?

489
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,401
- She answer it?
- l don't-- hello?

490
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,361
Is that my mom?

491
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,322
AIi, it's Sam.

492
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,534
- Sam?
- No, it's for your mom.

493
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,745
- It's Sam.
- Hey.

494
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:30,374
- Hey, who was that?
- Uh, it's...

495
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,794
- just a friend.
- Your mom's a cougar.

496
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,005
So I'm gIad you caIIed.

497
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,966
Yeah, me too.

498
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:43,137
Look, anyway, I was
just thinking about

499
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,889
how great
Iast weekend was.

500
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,892
And I was wondering if maybe
you weren't busy this weekend,

501
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,811
- we couId...
- Do it again?

502
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,772
- Yeah.
- I thought you had to IeaVe schooI.

503
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,483
No, l do.
WeII, I did.

504
00:28:56,651 --> 00:29:01,029
Anyway, that's kind of
what I wanted to taIk to you about.

505
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,283
I don't know if this
sounds weird or anything,

506
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,326
but l was wondering
if maybe this weekend

507
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,370
you couId bring
some of your friends...

508
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,414
Sit your ass down.

509
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,458
...and I couId bring
some of my friends.

510
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,252
And then some of your friends
couId give some of my friends,

511
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,171
uh, some Ietters too,

512
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,424
you know, to help
for my education fund?

513
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,718
- Oh.
- Or not.

514
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,553
I mean, it's totaIIy fine.

515
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,181
It was just an idea.
Just a stupid--

516
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,807
It's not a stupid idea.

517
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,893
Ask him if he has any friends.

518
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,811
- They told--
- Are you positiVe he's here?

519
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,271
- I'm dead positiVe.
- In here?

520
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,356
Yes-- I mean, 95% positiVe.

521
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,275
- HeIIo?
- Sam?

522
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,485
Sam?

523
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,821
- Sam?
- What?

524
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,785
Hold on.
He asked me.

525
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,370
- AIison?
- TeII him yes.

526
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,081
- l don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

527
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,333
What's your fuckin' probIem?

528
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,418
AIison?

529
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,924
Boys?

530
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,345
- Dan-o.
- Sir.

531
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,263
Um, sir,

532
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,057
if I may,

533
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,100
l think that we might
haVe found a soIution

534
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,354
to Sam's IittIe
economic issue.

535
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,356
A soIution?

536
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,483
Uh, yeah. A job.

537
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,568
A job?

538
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,156
A job that pays
$20,000 a semester?

539
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,243
What is it?
Ponzi scheme?

540
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,204
- Nah, man.
- WeII, sir,

541
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,790
my dad has some work
we can do for his company.

542
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,210
And see, it's a tax
sheIter kind of thing.

543
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,170
- Tax sheIter.
- Tax sheIter.

544
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,214
Yeah, Iike a 501(c), sir.

545
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,466
- Is this a fuckin' joke?
- Sir?

546
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,803
Um... we, uh--

547
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,638
Sam has a down payment.

548
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,934
I can see it.

549
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,435
Okay.

550
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,400
Are you boys seIIing drugs?

551
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,422
AII right.
l'll bite.

552
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,758
WeIcome back, Sam.

553
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,137
WhateVer you're doing,

554
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,930
keep it cIean.

555
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,349
Yeah.

556
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,393
They're young boys,
pick of the litter,

557
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,228
and they're a heII of a Iot cheaper
than a pair of Louis Vuittons.

558
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,314
Which pair? Wait,
what are you taIking about?

559
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,191
Judy, quit it.
We're not doing this.

560
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,401
- WiII you stop?
- Doing what?

561
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,570
Why do you two
aIways excIude me?

562
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,614
lt's 'cause
I'm younger, isn't it?

563
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,407
You just don't think
l understand--

564
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,451
- Enough.
- Whoa.

565
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,537
- What?
- Testy. Shit.

566
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,456
For your information,

567
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,499
AIison here is
acting aII bitchy

568
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,543
because I want to set up
some paid pIaydates

569
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,086
with a few boys
from Moore.

570
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,713
- PIaydates?
- Yes.

571
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,382
- You mean for shagging?
- Mm-hmm, I think it's so cooI.

572
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,177
l think it sounds awful
and compIeteIy iIIegaI.

573
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,637
Yes, it is, Judy.

574
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:14,056
Stop being such
a fucking square, Mary.

575
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:18,101
Mary is not a square.
She's oId fashioned.

576
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,519
I'm sorry,
but marrying an agent

577
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,480
who's gonna heIp our IittIe Ginger here
with her career

578
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,107
and give her a life of arm candy
doesn't make her oId fashioned.

579
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,235
- It makes her a fucking moron.
- Oh my God, excuse me.

580
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,030
Okay, stop.

581
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,575
Mary, don't Iisten to her.

582
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,786
And you,
I'Ve made myseIf cIear.

583
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,371
l don't think
we shouId do this.

584
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:41,458
- What is the big deaI? You aIready did it.
- And look at you.

585
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,335
It wasn't Iike that.

586
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,087
- ReaIIy?
- No.

587
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,589
You gaVe him
a check though.

588
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,716
You gaVe him a check?

589
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,843
Mary, I IoVe you,

590
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,262
but we're much oIder than you
and there are certain things--

591
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,057
She is in just as shitty
a relationship as you.

592
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,684
Stop justifying this.

593
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,979
- We aII know your husband--
- Fine! I fucked him.

594
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,272
I paid him.

595
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,608
But I was just trying
to help him out.

596
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,486
He's a decent kid
who was haVing a hard time.

597
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,613
So why don't you want
to heIp out your kid again?

598
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,115
What is the big deaI?

599
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,700
It was a mistake, Judy.

600
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:17,285
Oh, pIease.
It's a mistake?

601
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,706
Are you kidding me? It's a mistake now that we
want to have some fuckin' fun?

602
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,667
But with you it wasn't
a mistake, right?

603
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,878
Right. No.

604
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,256
- AIison.
- Mary.

605
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,508
I think it sounds
inVigorating.

606
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,428
You know what?
Let's just set it up for us.

607
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,929
And we'll find
some new girIs for Sam.

608
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,806
What?

609
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,184
I need this.
We need this.

610
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,104
- Come on.
- You know, I don't know about this.

611
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,897
Oh shut up, Mary. When was
the Iast time someone fucked you

612
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,692
- so hard you couIdn't waIk?
- Oh my God.

613
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,986
Jesus fucking Christ, Judy.

614
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,030
You know, now that
l think about it,

615
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,532
I think it sounds
really fun!

616
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,576
- Are they fit?
- Fit

617
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,536
and they are wiIIing.

618
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,581
lt's so true.
There is nothing sweeter

619
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,541
than a boy's worship
of the femaIe body.

620
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,627
Excuse me.
Who are you again?

621
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,379
Oh, this is Dominica, darIing.

622
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,132
- She's from South America.
- I met her at the PTA Iast week.

623
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,301
She's our new BFF.

624
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,678
By the way, you haVe
a beautiful home.

625
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:20,390
So what do you say?

626
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,566
Mmn.

627
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,156
Un minuto!

628
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,500
' Let's party tiII we die... '

629
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,627
No, FIeming,
it's not gonna work.

630
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,128
Hey, babe, I'm off out.

631
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,589
TeII 'em to put it on hoId.

632
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,674
What part of "no"
don't you get?

633
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,177
' FeeIin' so eIectric '

634
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,974
' FeeIin' so eIectric,
weIcome to my party '

635
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,018
' Night of the Iiving zombies '

636
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,062
' I'm rubbing on her body '

637
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,606
' We roIIing on a IoIIy '

638
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,235
' RoIIin' on a marIey '

639
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:16,238
' RoIIin', r-roIIin' '

640
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:23,537
' Let's party tiII we die,

641
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,747

00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,624
' Can't stop us,

643
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,711
' Let's party tiII we die,

644
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,013
' Let's party tiII we die '

00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,016
' Everyone is Vibing,

646
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:50,772
' Can't find nowhere in private,
so we do it in public. '

647
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,903
I think they want to meet.

648
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,116
Let's do it.

649
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:06,788
' Are you ready to rock? '

650
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,207
So, Judy, right?

651
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,917
Yeah.

652
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,669
So, Judy, what do you think?

653
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,671
- About what?
- Come on.

654
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,466
Let's cut the bullshit.
Let's get to what we came here for.

655
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,764
- Excuse me?
- Exactly.

656
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,727
- Sorry about my friend.
- It's okay.

657
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,229
Dude, change it!

658
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:34,107
I Iike your suit.

659
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,652
and I'm feeIing these sIippers.

660
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,740
- I'Ve got this too.

661
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,534
- I think you're reaIIy handsome.

662
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,912
Mmn.

663
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,331

Thank you.

Wait, that's perfect!
Don't change it!

667
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,174
That's perfect.
Thank you.

668
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,259
Where is she?
AIi! AIi?

669
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,261
- What?
- AIi!

670
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,513
Wait, do you know
what this reminds me of?

671
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,474
- No.
- ' Reach out and touch-- '

672
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,976
- Come on, AIi. This is so awesome.
- Judy.

673
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,686
- What?
- Nothing.

674
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,104
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

675
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,940
Let me teII him.
It's a funny story.

676
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,859
AIison had a IittIe more
than "nothing"

1014
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,523
I need to taIk to you

1015
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:22,026

1020
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,913
Just jump on

1021
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,888
So what'd you want

1022
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,973

1024
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,481
Look, Dan, before we

00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,909

00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,911

1031
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,788
I'm the boss.

1032
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,790
GiVe this kid a schoIarship.

1033
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,876
He deserves it."
Then they did it!

1034
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,879
So you can quit yourjob,

1035
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,923

1036
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,300
Thank you!

1037
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,052
I thought I was in troubIe!

1038
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,012
Nah nah.

1039
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,680
I was just fuckin' with you.

1040
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,603
Are you in troubIe?

1041
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,651
Uniforms. Put 'em on.

1042
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,987
There's a bathroom.
You can use it if you want to to change,

1043
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:53,617
but remember reaI women
like the fantasy of youth.

1044
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,994
White is Iike heaven.

1045
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,080
ReaI women Iike heaven.

1046
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,124
And boys?

1047
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,543
You're about to be deaIing
with some real women.

1048
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,086
Jimmy, what the fuck?

1049
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,963
Shit. Hey.

1050
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,048
- Sorry I started without you.
- What are you--

1051
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,843
Everyone, say hello
to your founding father Sam.

1052
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,886
CIap.

1053
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:22,896
- We got to talk.
- TaIk amongst yourseIf for a second.

1054
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,649
- We got to shut this down.
- What?

1055
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,693
You fucking ratted on us,
didn't you?

1056
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,278
He doesn't know anything.
Back off.

1057
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,071
Thank God.

1058
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,782
Guys, we got to quit
whiIe we're ahead here.

1059
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,826
- Why?
- Because he took me out

1060
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,494
and he toId me that he was
gonna pay for my tuition, that's why.

1061
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,037
Fucking Dan Fox?

1062
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,039
Dan.
Look, man, he's a cooI guy.

1063
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:44,710
- I don't want to betray his trust anymore.
- Mm-hmm.

1064
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,212
- It's the right fucking thing to do, Jimmy.
- I agree.

1065
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,381
This whoIe thing
is just subVersiVe.

1066
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,884
At first I thought
Mary IoVed me.

1067
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,052
Then I found out
she just wanted me for my body.

1068
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,014
Yeah, and Iast week,
Dominica used a diIdo

1069
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,932
on me, bro.

1070
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,018
So what?!

1071
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,937
Who gives a shit?
Open up your eyes, brothers.

1072
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:06,398
This IittIe thing that we started

1073
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,943
has turned into something bigger
than we could ever imagine.

1074
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:13,071
Sam, this is
a cash cow business here.

1075
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,782
lf we keep this up,
we can start franchising soon.

1076
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,910
- Franchising?
- Patrick's got a guy in Connecticut--

1077
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:19,912
his dad owns
Iike a chain of hoteIs.

1078
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,081
- What are you-- Patrick?
- I thought you hated that guy, Jimmy.

1079
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,041
When opportunity knocks,

1080
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,250
- you got to take it.
- Okay, stop.

1081
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,586
This is our chance to go
big leagues with it.

1082
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,838
James, come on, man.

1083
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,049
It'II be fine.
Let's just put this puppy to sIeep.

1084
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,513
Fine, but guys, for me,
please.

1085
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,098
We can end it.
Just giVe me tonight, okay?

1086
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,142
I mean, Sam,
there's peopIe at the door.

1087
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,436
We can't cancel. The recruits

1088
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,063

You'Ve known me the Iongest.

00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,153
Fuck the girls,

00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,821
PIease.

1093
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,907
Let's ceIebrate, huh?

1094
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,951
- Fine fine.

1095
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,327
Okay, but look,
I'm serious, man.

1096
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,329
- There's no more Iying.
- No more lying.

1097
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,623
After tonight.
One more night of Iying.

1098
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:05,958
Bring it in.

1099
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,964
- Sam?

1100
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:15,133
Oh shit.

1101
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,972
- What are you doing here?
- I was just waIking my dog

1102
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,932
and I thought I saw
my mom come up here.

1103
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,312
Your mom?
No, that's impossibIe.

1104
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,815
Um, do you IiVe around here?

1105
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,234
Uh, yeah.
Like a bIock away.

1106
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,570
No shit.

00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,405
So what are you

1108
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,448

You know, we've been dating

1124
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,904
and I've never
seen your pIace.

1125
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,159
What do you say?

1126
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,593
Oh no.

1131
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,607
Oh, that's right.

1132
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,651

my train wreck of a mother.

1134

Congratulations

1182
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,387

1185
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,480
So...

01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:24,401

- No thank you, sir.

1187
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:26,653

1188
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:30,323
Judy, I'd Iike to pick up

1189
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:32,284
over eggs and bacon.

1190
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:34,286
Fuck you.

1191
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:36,538

01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:47,591
Why don't you two
Iovebirds work it out?

1195
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,274

1196
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:09,446
- Uh...

1197
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,531
I don't know.

1198
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,325
You reaIIy think you can

1199
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:15,493

1200
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:20,707
- WeII?
- What? It's not what you think, okay?

1201
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,083
What do I think, Sam?

1202
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,753
I don't know what you think.

1203
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,551

01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,633
You're such

01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,819
I bet you think

1219
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,615
I don't know.

1220
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:21,327
He's a friend--
someone--

1221
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,496
my subcontractor.

1222
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:25,457
Oh, that's
the subcontractor.

1223
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:28,001
Okay.

1224
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:31,921
So, hey,
where you heading?

1225
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:38,762
Ah...

1226
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:41,222
I don't know.

1227
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:51,232
' Think I'II go Iive
by the beach '

1228
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,027
' Or in the mountains
through the frozen reach '

1229
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:57,697
' Or in the city where nothing's
moving sIow... '

1230
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:11,544
' OnIy time that
I'm feeIing right '

1231
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:14,464
- ' I'm singing through the burning Iight '
- lt's gonna be okay.

1232
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:16,633
Don't-- my hair.

1233
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:19,135
I Iove your hair.

1234
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,972
' Never cared
what anybody thought '

1235
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,016
' I do whatever
l want... '

1236
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:27,060
- I can expIain.
- What's there to expIain?

1237
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:30,522
You broke
my sister's heart.

1238
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:34,442
You stoIe my dad from me!

1239
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,195
You fuck!

1240
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:41,157
' Gonna give 'em
something to say '

1241
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:46,538
' Yeah, gonna
give 'em something '

1242
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:49,582
' You know I'm gonna
give 'em something '

1243
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:53,086
' Damn right, I'm gonna
give 'em something to say. '

1244
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:58,716
- Hey.
- Hey.

1245
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,016
Is that a bIack eye?

1246
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:10,145
Yeah.

1247
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:15,650
Um, look, here's--
here's-- here's the thing:

1248
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:19,070
My friends are gone,

1249
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:23,700
um...

1250
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,618
your daughter
won't taIk to me

1251
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:27,412
and I can bareIy Iook you
in the eyes anymore.

1252
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:33,293
l can't concentrate in class.
I can't concentrate outside of cIass.

1253
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,336
Your son just...

1254
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:36,880
came and kicked
the ever-Iiving shit out of me

1255
01:09:37,047 --> 01:09:38,756
and I can't write anymore.

1256
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:43,511
So I'm just going to taIk
for a minute.

1257
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,805
And you can just shut me up
whenever you feeI Iike, okay?

1258
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:47,807
Go ahead, go ahead.

1259
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:50,643
All right,
so my friends...

1260
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,732
you know, the ones who were
pooIing aII their money together

1261
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,984
to pay for my tuition--

1262
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:01,779
um...

1263
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:04,699
that money that we
puIIed together was dirty.

1264
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:07,368
AII right.

1265
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,287
So what I'm basicaIIy
trying to tell you

1266
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,372
is that we started
an escort service

1267
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:13,750
that catered to your wife
and all of her friends.

1268
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,793
And I swear to God
l had no idea

1269
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:18,004
that it was your--

1270
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:21,966
that it was your wife.
And her friends

1271
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:24,802
were aII just fuckin'--

1272
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,639
once this whoIe thing
started, man,

1273
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:32,644
I couIdn't stop it.
I reaIIy reaIIy--

1274
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:34,270
it was going
just reaIIy weII

1275
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:36,022
and then you came
and you told me

1276
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:38,816
that you got the schooI
to pay for my-- my tuition

1277
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:40,818
and I feIt awfuI.

1278
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,948
I just feIt fuckin' awfuI.

1279
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:46,741
And I wanted to teII you about it,
but l couldn't.

1280
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,785
I didn't teII you about it,

1281
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:53,248
so then I went to the rentaI house
where we wouId,

1282
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,166
you know, do everything
and l tried to stop it.

1283
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,753
But I didn't stop it there because I figured,
"What the fuck?

1284
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,797
One night. One night.
One more time.

1285
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:04,884
Let's have one more time.
We'II go one more time."

1286
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,595
But it's not gonna be
one more time.

1287
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:13,893
Even if you hadn't caught us,
it wasn't gonna be one more time.

1288
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:15,478
And the onIy reason
you didn't catch me

1289
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:17,981
was 'cause I was out
alone with your--

1290
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:20,024
I was at your house--
your house!

1291
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:22,068
--with your
fuckin' daughter.

1292
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,865
Post script: I had no idea
it was your daughter,

1293
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:30,076
but...

1294
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:34,289
I tried to come cIean
with her.

1295
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:36,457
And...

1296
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,921
l don't know, man.
I'm just reaIIy fuckin' Iost.

1297
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:43,965
And l know
that you're probabIy

1298
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,800
just super pissed

1299
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,011
and you don't care,

1300
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:50,054
but...

1301
01:11:58,022 --> 01:12:00,606
Are you roIIing a joint?

1302
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:06,988
I'm Iistening.

1303
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:18,249
You're not even mad?

1304
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,835
Kinda.

1305
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,670
Nah, not reaIIy.

1306
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,839
No.

1307
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:28,968
Come on, man.
I knew what was going on.

1308
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:33,639
- You did?
- Huh?

1309
01:12:33,807 --> 01:12:35,641
- You did?
- WeII, of course I did.

1310
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,977
Find all your buddies
with a bunch of oIder women?

1311
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,355
And magicaI cash?

1312
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,691
l mean, l'm stupid,
but I'm not a fuckin' idiot.

1313
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,861
And you know what?
You said it.

1314
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,280
You didn't fuck my wife.

1315
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:52,200
You didn't know Courtney
was my daughter.

1316
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,579
And you did what you needed
to do to stay here.

1317
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:59,082
- So now what?
- Now what what?

1318
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:00,792
You gonna kick me
out of school?

1319
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:02,835
Nah.
Your friends?

1320
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:06,172
They took the heat for you.

1321
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,051
Anyway, you know what?

1322
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,095
You'Ve been kicked out
of too many schooIs.

1323
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,348
So l told
the new headmaster that--

1324
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,892
Whoa, hang on. What do you mean
new headmaster?

1325
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,936
Oh yeah.

1326
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,397
I resigned this morning.

1327
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:28,569
The new headmaster
is English.

1328
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:33,241
I hear he wears bow ties.

1329
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,328
So,

1330
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:38,996
if you do stay here,

1331
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:40,706
your schoIarship is safe.

1332
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:43,376
Look, man,
thank you, but...

1333
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:49,966
I have absoIuteIy
no interest

1334
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,385
in staying here,

1335
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:56,681
I mean without you
or my friends, so...

1336
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,975
I figured as much.

1337
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:10,862
You know what?
You're gonna be aII right.

1338
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:13,990
- l don't know about that.
- No, you're gonna be aII right.

1339
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:16,033
I know.

1340
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:18,077
ReaIIy.

1341
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:26,043
So what are you gonna do
about your family?

1342
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:29,046
WeII...

1343
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:32,842
that famiIy--
my famiIy's had probIems

1344
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,344
for a long time
way before you came.

1345
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:38,806
And Judy and I, weII,

1346
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,892
we were done years ago.

1347
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:44,729
Shawn.

1348
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:47,023
He's a troubIed kid.

1349
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:51,068
I feeI responsibIe
for aII that troubIe he has.

1350
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:56,157
But that's the gift
a father giVes a son--

1351
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:59,577
resentment and scorn.

1352
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:02,455
He'II be aII right.

1353
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:05,082
He'II come around

01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:09,420
And that IittIe girI of mine?

SeriousIy.

1363
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:43,496
You think l'm too old
to go back on the road?

1364
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:46,040
Nah.
Just wrap it up.

1365
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,334
Oh, I'm gonna

01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:04,809
Okay.

01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:14,235
heroes aren't born,

1375
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,404
they're cornered.

1376
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:20,783

1377
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:24,537

Oh, I pIay so good

1381
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,229
' Everything's gonna be aII right '

1382
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:53,107
' Everything's
gonna be aII right '

1383
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,610
' Everything's gonna
be aII right now '

1384
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:57,028
' Everything's gonna

1385
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:07,038

WeII, if you must know,

in The ViIIage

1393
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:39,528
for the Iast year
and a haIf of high schooI.

1394
01:17:39,696 --> 01:17:42,198
I hear they're eccentric
artists, so that's cooI.

1395
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:44,408
That's cooI.

1396
01:17:46,244 --> 01:17:48,204

01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:02,134
then maybe you shouId
Iet me take one.

1402
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:03,552
We can just say

Okay.
