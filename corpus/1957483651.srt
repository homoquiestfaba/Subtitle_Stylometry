Sinbad : Where u been? (2010)

2
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:12,043
We'd like to thank you
for coming out

3
00:00:12,068 --> 00:00:14,599
to the church of Nokia.

4
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:18,943
A lot of people have been, uh,
wondering where Sinbad's been.

5
00:00:19,068 --> 00:00:21,806
Some of y'all thought
I was dead.

6
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:25,943
And you twittered and you texted
without even asking nobody.

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:29,357
Just passed a lie
around the world.

8
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:30,707
Y'all read in the paper,

9
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:33,128
y'all seen on the news
about the tax problems.

10
00:00:33,148 --> 00:00:34,599
I ain't trying to hide.

11
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:37,081
Sometimes you owe money,

12
00:00:37,206 --> 00:00:40,943
and you got to go undercover
deep, deep, deep, deep.

13
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:42,704
It's not my fault.
It could happen to anybody.

14
00:00:42,724 --> 00:00:44,254
It could happen to you.

15
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:46,254
It could happen to you.

16
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,081
It could happen to you!

17
00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:50,806
But it didn't.
It happened to me.

18
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:53,380
But I'm gonna say this...
I ain't hiding no more.

19
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:55,943
I ain't hiding, man.
I ain't hiding no more.

20
00:00:56,068 --> 00:00:59,771
I went to my
spiritual advisor, prince.

21
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:01,081
Yes.

22
00:01:01,206 --> 00:01:03,771
The church of the royal badness.

23
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:06,012
As I put my tithe in the plate,

24
00:01:06,137 --> 00:01:09,081
I said, "prince,
what should I do?"

25
00:01:09,206 --> 00:01:12,426
"Boy, just play the drums

26
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:15,254
and play them loud!"

27
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:31,344

28
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:17,034

29
00:02:21,862 --> 00:02:24,426

Now, how y'all doing?

Yeah! Yeah!

Yeah!

33

You know what?
You're gonna have to cut it.

34
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:38,138
I ain't got enough money
to pay for the whole song.

35
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,012
Oh, I'm sorry.

36
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:42,081
- It's a very expensive song.
- That's all I had.

37
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:45,047
I want to apologize.
That's all I had in the budget.

I'm sorry.

40
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:51,118
Y'all gonna have to get
off stage for the union rules.

41
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,047
It's my... I apologize.

42
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,877
Times are hard. I'm trying
to get black folks working.

43
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:57,702
I'm sorry. Just unplug, please.

44
00:02:57,827 --> 00:03:00,116
Unplug, then leave, please.
Thank you.

45
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:02,254
Just please leave.

46

Thank you so much.

Yo.

Whoo!

52
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:17,599
Ready here
for a comedy central taping.

53
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:19,426
Comedy central.

54
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:21,184
How y'all doing? What's up, man?

55
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:22,788
How y'all doing in the balcony?

56
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:25,599
Man.

57
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:26,978
Whoo!

58
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:30,943
It's been about what...
10, 10, 15... 10?

59
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:32,771
10 years?

60
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:35,448
You know, and people say,
"Sinbad, where you been?"

61
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:37,971
I'm like, "where y'all been?
I've been working."

62
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:40,943
I'm working.
I'm trying to make money.

63
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:42,943
Pay my bills, man.

64
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:44,531
It's cra... you know, I look...

65
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:47,256
Right now, I mean, I just want
to get some things out.

66
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:49,728
There's things that people
don't know about me.

67
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,047
I'm under stress.

68
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:55,771
They killed me on Wikipedia.
They killed me.

69
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:58,186
And I didn't stay dead
long enough to sell no DVDs.

70
00:03:58,206 --> 00:03:59,992
I didn't even stay dead
long enough.

71
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:02,109
I was too stupid.
I should've stayed low.

72
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:04,219
I should've laid low.

73
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,100
I could've been gone for a year.
I would've made money.

74
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,804
Then I'd have risen
from the dead.

75
00:04:08,844 --> 00:04:10,633
I'd have been in Europe.

76
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:13,288
I'd have been European.

77
00:04:13,413 --> 00:04:15,633
I could've been like vin diesel.

78
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:18,599
They don't know he's black.

79
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:22,081
That's why he gets the work.
They don't know.

80
00:04:22,206 --> 00:04:24,048
'Cause I want to deal
with all that right now.

81
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:26,364
We got a black president.
We got Barack Obama.

82
00:04:26,384 --> 00:04:27,711
We have a black president.

83
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:29,081
We have this...

84
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:31,393
And we need to deal
with the whole situation,

85
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:32,669
but the world's going crazy.

86
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,531
We got people mad
that we got a black president.

87
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:35,572
But he's half white.

88
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,771
We claimed our half.
Y'all get yours.

89
00:04:40,206 --> 00:04:41,584
There's some for everybody.

90
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:43,081
He got some...

91
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:45,116
For everybody.

92
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:46,943
Why y'all mad?
He's for everybody.

93
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:49,875
He's every... he's everybody.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,704
It's never gonna get
better than this.

95
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,765
This is the best black man
we gonna find.

96
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:55,012
There are no more.

97
00:04:55,137 --> 00:04:57,771
There are no black men
raised in Kansas and Hawaii.

98
00:04:57,896 --> 00:04:59,943
That's the last one.

99
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:01,806
Y'all better treat
this one right.

100
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:05,185
The next one gonna be
from Cleveland.

101
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,426
He gonna wear a perm.

102
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:11,771
Then you're gonna see
what it's really like.

103
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:15,012
Health care gonna go through
like this, like this.

104
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:21,461
See, Barack got something
about him.

105
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:22,964
He got something about him.

106
00:05:22,984 --> 00:05:24,564
That's why I can see the mix,

107
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,704
'cause even black people say...
I got to tell white people.

108
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:29,071
When he first was running,
we were like this...

109
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:31,254
"What... what is...?"

110
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:34,254
We didn't know either.
We didn't know.

111
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,012
We were texting...
"You know him?

112
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,770
I ain't never seen
this brother."

113
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:44,064
And then I realized that
he's gonna win 'cause he's calm.

114
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:48,323
See, a black man from Cleveland,
Detroit, Chicago, L.A...

115
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,642
It would've come out
in one of them debates.

116
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:51,951
What you... what you say?

117
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:59,624
It would've come out.
It would've popped out.

118
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:01,771
But they couldn't shake him.

119
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:04,090
He'd be like,
"wait, wait, John, John, John.

120
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:06,875
Wait, hey."

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,737
I'm like, "hit him!
Hit him, Barack!"

122
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:12,599
You got a name
like Barack Obama,

123
00:06:12,724 --> 00:06:13,599
you're supposed to fight.

124
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:15,510
Barack Obama, knee him,
now hit him.

125
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,564
Barack Obama, Barack Obama.

126
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:21,426
In 15 rounds, Barack Obama.

127
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:24,116
It's a throwdown!

128
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:28,254
Whoo!

129
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:30,771
Come on in late, my people.

130
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:32,682
My people, come on in late.
Come on.

131
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:35,665
And you got a front-row seat.
Go in late, front-row seat.

132
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:38,943
See, we got a black president,
but everything didn't change.

133
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:41,047
We keeping it real.
We keeping it real.

134
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:42,254
We keeping it...

135
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:46,262
Ooh, somebody stole your seat.
Look at that.

136
00:06:49,724 --> 00:06:51,150
They stealing seats.

137
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:55,943
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo!

138
00:06:56,068 --> 00:06:58,160
Wait a minute.
How did three people leave?

139
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,288
One person came.

140
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:01,978
Y'all were tripled up
on the seat?

141
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:04,081
Times are tight.

142
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:06,298
We gonna buy one seat.
Walk in real close.

143
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:25,363
So let me help...
I want to help people tonight.

144
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:27,081
I want to reveal truth tonight.

145
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:28,771
That's what I'm trying to do.

146
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:30,359
I'm gonna deal with...
First of all,

147
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:31,842
all my life,
you deal with being...

148
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:32,943
Let's get with it,

149
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:34,359
and being the high-yellow,
high-yellow brother.

150
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,254
High-yellow, high-yellow,
high-yellow... melanin.

151
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:39,114
"You're so yellow.
You're so light.

152
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:41,331
You're so light,
I thought you was white."

153
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:42,351
You did.

154
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,165
I'm right here
in your neighborhood.

155
00:07:44,206 --> 00:07:47,254
My parents are black,
but you thought I was white.

156
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:49,150
"No, I'm... I'm just saying."

157
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:52,081
It's crazy, man.
It's crazy how...

158
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:54,186
And then I didn't get the
advantage of being high-yellow.

159
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:57,081
I didn't get green eyes.
I didn't get the wavy hair.

160
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:59,254
I got Jack.

161
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,318
I was just light black
with nappy hair.

162
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:03,081
I didn't get none
of the texture.

163
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:06,392
I didn't get the texture.

164
00:08:06,517 --> 00:08:09,012
I could've been Cuban.
I could've played Cuban.

165
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:13,426
I can't even fake that.

166
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:17,426
I'm just almost albino.

167
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:19,221
I want to deal with all this
stuff about keeping it real.

168
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:20,876
Everybody talking
about keeping it real.

169
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:22,186
That's the whole new thing.

170
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:24,502
"I'm keeping it real."
What's keeping it real?

171
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:26,186
Most of the time somebody say
they keeping it real,

172
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,599
run from that person. Run.

173
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:28,771
Get away from them,

174
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:30,531
'cause, you know,
keeping it real...

175
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,980
You just do the right thing.

176
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:33,803
Everybody hood.
"I'm from the hood.

177
00:08:33,823 --> 00:08:35,599
"I'm hood.
I'm the hood. I'm hood."

178
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,969
What does that mean?
Everybody from the hood.

179
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:41,102
Everybody... the hood done moved
all the way up to the valley.

180
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:43,254
The valley is the hood now.

181
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:44,943
"I'm from the hood. I'm hood.

182
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:46,357
Calabasas!"

183
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:52,862
"West westside. W-w-w-west."

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,771
Ooh!

185
00:08:56,896 --> 00:08:58,478
I'm gonna tell y'all right now.

186
00:08:58,498 --> 00:08:59,447
Times are tight.

187
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:01,186
See, people are trippin',
talking about recession.

188
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:03,247
I'm 53 years old.
We've been here before.

189
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:05,219
This ain't new to us.
We've been broke.

190
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,426
It's y'all in your 20s like,
"what are we gonna do?

191
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:10,806
"My iPod. My...

192
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:12,668
"My iPod.

193
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:16,081
I can't get the new iPod."

194
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:18,517
Then sing!

195
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:23,254
Learn the song and sing it.

196
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:26,426
That's how you live broke.

197
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:28,599
Don't be ashamed
'cause you broke.

198
00:09:28,724 --> 00:09:30,704
Don't be walking around like
you ashamed 'cause you broke.

199
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:33,071
People that look like
they got money are broke,

200
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:34,495
just as broke as you.

201
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,531
They roll up on you in the car...
"You need a ride,"

202
00:09:36,551 --> 00:09:38,771
'cause they hope
you got gas money.

203
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:41,192
"Why don't you ride with me?
No, no, I insist.

204
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:42,212
No, I insist."

205
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:47,393
See, all of this was not
the government's fault.

206
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:49,393
A lot of it was the government's
fault, but we jacked up.

207
00:09:49,413 --> 00:09:52,016
We asked for way too much stuff,
way too much stuff.

208
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:53,771
You got a job making $100 a year

209
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:56,254
and bought a house
for $3 million.

210
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:59,390
Talking about, "I don't know
what happened with the payment.

211
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,403
"They changed it.
The payment went up.

212
00:10:01,515 --> 00:10:05,254
"It was a dollar a month.
It was a dollar a month.

213
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:08,392
And it changed
after six months."

214
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:09,771
Don't be stupid, man.

215
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:11,359
Don't let people treat you
like you're stupid.

216
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:13,369
If it sounds too good
to be true, it is.

217
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:16,047
Like that man Bernie madoff
took, what, $500 million?

218
00:10:16,172 --> 00:10:18,943
I can't even say it.
Five hu... five...

219
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:21,160
How do you steal $500 million
and be calm?

220
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:22,466
I couldn't even fake it.

221
00:10:22,486 --> 00:10:23,486
Whoo!

222
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:26,943
"How you doing?" "I got..."

223
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:30,530
"I got your money! I got...

224
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:33,943
"I can't believe
y'all gave me your money.

225
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:37,068
It's gone! It's gone!"

226
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,943
How do you take $500 million?

227
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:44,803
I knew there wasn't
no black folks,

228
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:46,943
'cause he's still alive.

229
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:49,426
And I'm not talking
about $500 million.

230
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:52,909
Black people...
"I gave him $1,000.

231
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:56,116
I gave him a...
That's all my money!"

232
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:57,426
I saw people on TV...

233
00:10:57,551 --> 00:10:59,599
"I lost everything.
I lost $20 million."

234
00:10:59,724 --> 00:11:01,255
You... you ain't at his house?

235
00:11:01,275 --> 00:11:03,633
I'd have been outside
the gate... "Bernie!"

236
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:11,876
"I know there's some money.
I'm going over the fence."

237
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:13,254
You see me on the news...

238
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:16,943
"Sinbad went over the fence
at Bernie madoff's house."

239
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:20,081
I'm gonna get my money back.

240
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:23,254
I'm cheap. That's why I don't
even go to strip clubs.

241
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:24,945
"Lap dance?
You better dance over there.

242
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:28,081
"I'm right here. I'm just here
listening to the music.

243
00:11:28,206 --> 00:11:30,349
Make it rain?
I'll hit you with a quarter."

244
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:32,128
Wha-hap!

245
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:39,502
Men... y'all got to quit going
to strip clubs.

246
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:40,599
Men, men, go home.

247
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:42,943
Go home.

248
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,392
Go home. Go home.

249
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:46,771
Go home.

250
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:48,221
Now, I'm gonna help
the ladies out.

251
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,027
Why you think men go
to strip clubs?

252
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:51,527
Why do men go to strip clubs?

253
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:53,704
Why you think men go
to strip clubs?

254
00:11:53,724 --> 00:11:55,876
See, women, y'all don't
understand the mind of a man.

255
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:57,376
I'm gonna help y'all tonight.

256
00:11:57,396 --> 00:11:59,444
Why you think men go
to strip clubs?

257
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:02,806
'Cause a half-naked woman
smile at you and say your name,

258
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,771
which y'all don't do at home.

259
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:05,917
What you do at home?

260
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,633
"Oh, here he is.
Here your daddy.

261
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:09,426
"Your daddy here.

262
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:12,000
Look who's finally here.
Here he come."

263
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:17,081
You used to like him.

264
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:19,599
Ladies, what happens
once we get married?

265
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:21,150
You hate us.

266
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:23,254
I mean, you hate us.

267
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,771
When we date you...
"I love you, I love you.

268
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:27,254
Y-y-y-you."

269
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,876
You say the same thing,
but it means different things.

270
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:31,324
When you date us,
you show your friends.

271
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:32,738
"There he is."
"Oh, my god, that's him?"

272
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:33,881
"Oh, god, that's him."

273
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:36,116
When you're married...
"Here he go.

274
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:39,426
"Yeah, that's him.
That's what god blessed me with.

275
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,482
I guess god was mad at me."

276
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,943
Same words, different meaning.

277
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:49,568
When you first get together,
she's in the kitchen,

278
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:51,943
you walk up behind her...
"You so nasty."

279
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:53,956
When you been married,
you just nasty.

280
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:55,737
"That's just nasty.

281
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:59,482
Back up. Touch me again.
Touch me again."

282
00:13:02,137 --> 00:13:04,288
We say stuff we don't mean.

283
00:13:04,413 --> 00:13:06,047
We all say stuff we don't mean.

284
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:08,366
Men say, "I just want to find
a good woman."

285
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:10,532
"Well, you got one."
"That mean you? Oh."

286
00:13:14,896 --> 00:13:18,081
We all want something else...
Other than what we have

287
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:20,599
and don't realize
what you got works.

288
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:22,081
It works.

289
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:24,081
It does work. You got to work.

290
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:26,943
Marriage is work.

291
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:29,262
Marriage is a career.
It's not an adventure.

292
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:32,771
You do more before 5:00
than most folks do all day.

293
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,633
It's like the military.

294
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:37,738
My wife and I... we were together
about six, seven years.

295
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:40,054
We're married, we divorced
about 10, 11 years.

296
00:13:40,074 --> 00:13:42,357
Now we're back together,
married eight years.

297
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:47,771
'Cause we're both so damaged,
we can't be with nobody else.

298
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:50,495
We had to come back home.

299
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,376
Once you've been married
to each other, you're trained.

300
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:54,185
I'm trained.

301
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,198
I ain't got time
to train nobody else.

302
00:13:56,323 --> 00:13:58,508
She ain't got time
to train nobody else.

303
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:00,323
Everybody's jacked up.

304
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:01,775
Go back to when you had...

305
00:14:01,896 --> 00:14:04,254
"I thought you was crazy.
Everybody crazy.

306
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:08,426
I know you're crazy.
I can deal with your crazy."

307
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:10,461
And all you men out here
55 years old

308
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:12,393
trying to date some girl 20,
like she like you.

309
00:14:12,413 --> 00:14:13,978
Are you out your mind?

310
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,943
She wants your house.

311
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:19,839
I don't see no 20-year-old girls

312
00:14:19,896 --> 00:14:22,186
with a broke-down
55-year-old man with no money.

313
00:14:22,206 --> 00:14:23,737
You don't see no girl at 20...

314
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:26,567
"Oh, he's... look at the homeless
dude, but he's cute.

315
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:28,139
Hey, hey!"

316
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:32,426
She wants you to die.

317
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:37,254
And if you keep messing
with her, you will.

318
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:41,310
You want a woman that
understands the signs of stroke.

319
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:45,564
That's what I'm looking for...

320
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:47,883
A woman that got my medication
in her purse.

321
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:50,875
"Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.

322
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,174
I thought you took it."

323
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:53,310
"I thought I did."

324
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,426
You want a woman
that's your nurse.

325
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:02,771
See, if you go to dinner
with a woman that's 55 years old

326
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:06,012
and your little lip curl up,
she'd know what to do.

327
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:08,771
"Hey, hey, hey,
Jamal, Jamal, look at me.

328
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:11,426
Jamal, look at me."

329
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:14,081
She'll get you to a hospital

330
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:15,806
and save your life.

331
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:19,806
But a girl 20...
"Quit making faces at me.

332
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:21,689
It's not funny anymore."

333
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:26,186
Now you all stroked out
for the rest of your life,

334
00:15:26,206 --> 00:15:27,890
'cause your little cute
girlfriend

335
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,543
didn't know the signs of stroke.

336
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:31,599
She come visit you
in the hospital...

337
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:33,357
"I ain't know
what a stroke was."

338
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:35,771
"I tried to tell..."

339
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:37,599
"I don't understand you."

340
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:40,840
"I had a stroke."

341
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:45,150
"But can I have
your house now...

342
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:48,254
Since you can't live there
no more?"

343
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:53,870
Marriage is
about growing old together.

344
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:57,081
Marriage is about falling apart
at the same time.

345
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,771
That's what makes it special.

346
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:02,907
You live long enough, the two
of you become one good person.

347
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:03,737
You become one.

348
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,530
One can see, one can hear.

349
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:10,012
One can walk,
one can use their hands.

350
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,426
You need each other.

351
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:14,439
You have to go
to the movies together.

352
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,081
One listens, one watches.

353
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:24,137
You become a team.

354
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:30,537
One got a good right hip,
one a good left hip,

355
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,315
and you're balanced.

356
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:35,860
"They're so cute together."

357
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,668
No, they'd fall down.

358
00:16:37,793 --> 00:16:40,655
They need one another.

359
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:50,943
Whoo!

360
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:54,254
'Cause see, once... once you've
been with somebody so long,

361
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,706
you just understand stuff.

362
00:16:55,726 --> 00:16:58,288
You have the same vision.
You share glasses.

363
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:00,148
You got glasses
all over the house.

364
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:01,806
"Wait, girl, let me...

365
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:03,943
I think they're
behind the stove."

366
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:11,956
I always had 20/20 vision
all my life.

367
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:13,599
I can't see now.

368
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:15,000
You know how I found out?

369
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,344
I'm in the movie theater,

370
00:17:16,379 --> 00:17:19,254
and I'm the only one
going like this... "Focus it!"

371
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:21,471
And usually other people
join in with you.

372
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:22,771
They were like...

373
00:17:22,896 --> 00:17:26,771
You might want to move down
toward the front, Sinbad.

374
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:28,704
So now I got
them progressive glasses,

375
00:17:28,724 --> 00:17:31,684
so I can see far at the top,
and I see close at the bottom.

376
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:33,850
But... they told me
you can drive with it.

377
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,495
No, you can't.

378
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,835
You got to learn the sweet spot.
You got to find the sweet spot.

379
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:41,151
You know how many times
I stop at a stop sign?

380
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:43,358
It's way out there somewhere.

381
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:44,254
"What?

382
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:46,081
"Oh, wait a minute.

383
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:48,943
"My bad, my bad.

384
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,655
It's right here.
My bad. I'm sorry."

385
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:58,186
So I want to help you ladies
with questions you have,

386
00:17:58,206 --> 00:17:59,359
anything you might have...

387
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,945
Something about a man
that throws you off,

388
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:02,600
something about your man
that drives you crazy.

389
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,116
I'll fix it in 13 seconds.

390
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:06,219
You don't need
no long counseling.

391
00:18:06,344 --> 00:18:08,221
Any woman... something about a man
that makes you mad.

392
00:18:08,241 --> 00:18:10,048
Anything, something...
Shout it out. Shout it.

393
00:18:10,068 --> 00:18:11,531
- Being romantic.
- Being romantic.

394
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:13,048
What does that mean? You got
to be specific with a man.

395
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:14,359
I don't even know
what you talking about.

396
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:16,420
Be romantic.
What... fix the screen door?

397
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,943
What?

398
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:20,771
What do you want me to do?

399
00:18:20,896 --> 00:18:23,771
"I want romance.
I want ro... I want romance."

400
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,943
What?

401
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:28,116
Hold your hand. What?

402
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,978
Then say it. Look at your man.

403
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:34,288
"Hold my hand."
"Ah! I got it, I got it!"

404
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:38,668
Now you finally got
what you're looking for.

405
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:40,171
"I want romance. I want..."

406
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:41,324
'Cause you read those books.

407
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:42,875
How to make love last forever.

408
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:44,378
How to have romance forever.

409
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:46,081
Too much work.

410
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:48,116
Just say what you want.

411
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:50,333
You got a man always
forget your birthday?

412
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,091
Forget that. Buy yourself a car.

413
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:53,994
"Look what you got me."

414
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:56,689
He'll remember next year.

415
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:03,012
"I'll never forget
your birthday again.

416
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:05,931
That one cost me
a lot of money."

417
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:10,875
Oh. Okay, what confuses you
the most about women?

418
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'll fix it.

419
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,359
What confuses you most
about women?

420
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:14,635
I'm gonna fix it for you.

421
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,497
- I'll help you understand it.
- Their anger!

422
00:19:16,517 --> 00:19:18,048
They act like nothing's wrong.

423
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:19,723
That they act like... you're
not married, are you?

424
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,668
'Cause you're talking.

425
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,737
She ain't here, is she?

426
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,461
Why you talking?
You ain't learned nothing.

427
00:19:26,586 --> 00:19:28,702
You haven't learned
nothing in your life.

428
00:19:28,827 --> 00:19:30,409
That's why you stay in trouble.

429
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:35,517
You know what she did?
She did this.

430
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,462
See, you don't know
what the means.

431
00:19:38,482 --> 00:19:39,564
You're a single man.

432
00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:40,564
That means
this man's in trouble.

433
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:41,965
He don't even understand.

434
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:44,737
She did that.

435
00:19:44,862 --> 00:19:47,668
They're gonna be in the car.
"What?"

436
00:19:47,793 --> 00:19:49,737
"Why you always gotta
say something?"

437
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:53,047
"He asked me something."

438
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:57,254
That's a man that's sleeping
downstairs tonight.

439
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:58,943
Look at all these men.

440
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:02,702
Looking at these
married men sitting here.

441
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,664
They're trying to assume
the position

442
00:20:04,684 --> 00:20:07,840
of getting in no trouble.

443
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:10,806
That's your job as a man...
To get in trouble.

444
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:12,219
That's your job.

445
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,600
Your problem is you're
trying not to be in trouble.

446
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,323
Accept the trouble.
And be sarcastic with it.

447
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,702
Piss them off.

448
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:20,081
That's half the fun
of being married.

449
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:22,047
"You did that on purpose."

450
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:25,185
"Oh, yes, I did!"

451
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,702
That's foreplay.

452
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,817
They need to have
training for husbands.

453
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:33,403
Men training for husbands.
How to be a husband.

454
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:36,185
How to talk.
How to survive a day.

455
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,635
You gotta practice.
You gotta look in the mirror.

456
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:39,012
"What? No."

457
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,771
You gotta learn
to make those faces.

458
00:20:41,896 --> 00:20:43,529
Act like you're trying to speak,

459
00:20:43,603 --> 00:20:45,185
but don't let nothing come out.

460
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:49,254
Don't say nothing,

461
00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:53,978
but act like you're
trying to be involved.

462
00:20:54,103 --> 00:20:55,124
Men are so confused.

463
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:56,839
I got a son that's 20 years old.

464
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:57,808
My daughter's 23.

465
00:20:57,862 --> 00:20:59,083
My daughter says she's
trying to find a good man.

466
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:01,399
I said, "learn to be
by yourself for a second.

467
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:02,668
Don't be crying."

468
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,014
She waving. You got a man.

469
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:05,288
Why you raise your hand?

470
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:06,773
She's like this. You with a man!

471
00:21:06,793 --> 00:21:09,242
She said, "that's right."
Look what you just did.

472
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:10,847
That's right. Be by yourself.

473
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:13,201
As you hold his hand.

474
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:14,296
What was that about?

475
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:15,531
"That's right. Be by yourself.

476
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:17,012
I'm talking about you."

477
00:21:17,137 --> 00:21:19,127
Now if he had done that,
"that's right."

478
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:21,737
"Oh, really?"

479
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:23,189
You be in the parking lot.

480
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:25,288
"What? What I say?

481
00:21:25,413 --> 00:21:27,344
Slow down!"

482
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:43,288
You better love that man.
He got you a front row seat.

483
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:45,943
At least it's good for a show.

484
00:21:46,068 --> 00:21:47,945
You see, young...
How old are you right now?

485
00:21:47,965 --> 00:21:49,139
- How old are you?
- 34.

486
00:21:49,172 --> 00:21:51,047
34. See, you're
still young, man.

487
00:21:51,172 --> 00:21:53,417
You know, see, my mom...
My mom's generation,

488
00:21:53,482 --> 00:21:55,014
they know how... they know
how to work it.

489
00:21:55,034 --> 00:21:56,288
My mom worked my dad.

490
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:58,047
My mom had my dad put patio in.

491
00:21:58,172 --> 00:21:59,495
Build a guest room.

492
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,018
They knew how to work
a brother back in the day.

493
00:22:02,143 --> 00:22:03,466
My dad was like a slave.

494
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:05,840
"You need to put that roof up?"

495
00:22:05,965 --> 00:22:07,598
She look at him.
"There's my man.

496
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:09,323
My man can do everything."

497
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:17,219
All she had to do
was give him some kool-aid.

498
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,965
Working. Working it!
Work, work, work!

499
00:22:24,689 --> 00:22:26,564
'Cause my mom got style.

500
00:22:26,689 --> 00:22:28,730
Young ladies, y'all gotta
get style back.

501
00:22:28,758 --> 00:22:30,150
Y'all angry, y'all angry.

502
00:22:30,275 --> 00:22:32,310
Y'all are angry. Y'all just...

503
00:22:34,862 --> 00:22:36,461
Just mad.

504
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:38,012
Smile sometime.

505
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:40,875
You might have a good man.
You just don't know it.

506
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,081
You just stay so angry. What...

507
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:44,393
Ladies, what are y'all
mad about?

508
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:45,428
Let me help...
What are y'all mad about?

509
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,047
Y'all are no good!

510
00:22:47,172 --> 00:22:49,495
- 'Cause we're no good.
- Every man no good.

511
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,253
Every man.
See, that's one woman.

512
00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:54,633
Every man. You dated everybody?

513
00:22:54,758 --> 00:23:00,288
Or did you miss somebody?

514
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:02,081
Maybe that's the problem.

515
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:05,599
You dating too many people.

516
00:23:05,724 --> 00:23:09,185
Pick one. See what happens.

517
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,359
Okay, I'm gonna go with that.
What makes a man no good?

518
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:13,702
I'm gonna help ladies out.
He lies.

519
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:16,461
That's how you make
a relationship stay alive.

520
00:23:16,586 --> 00:23:18,984
If a man does not lie,
the relationship is done,

521
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:21,303
'cause you ask questions
that make no sense.

522
00:23:21,323 --> 00:23:22,633
So I have to lie.

523
00:23:22,758 --> 00:23:26,150
If you don't want me to lie,
quit asking me questions.

524
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:28,426
You keep asking me questions

525
00:23:28,551 --> 00:23:31,806
that you know I have to lie at.

526
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:35,150
"Do I look fat?" "No, no."

527
00:23:35,275 --> 00:23:37,418
If you wasn't fat,
you wouldn't have asked.

528
00:23:37,438 --> 00:23:39,244
That's why you asked
the question.

529
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:42,116
Skinny people don't say,
"do I look fat?"

530
00:23:42,241 --> 00:23:44,180
Skinny people say,
"do you want to eat?

531
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,047
Would you like
to have a sandwich?"

532
00:23:48,172 --> 00:23:49,704
She just wants to see
how dumb you are

533
00:23:49,724 --> 00:23:51,081
when you tell the truth.

534
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:53,117
And men... all you young men,
don't you fall for this one.

535
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:56,047
"Even if it hurts me...
Even if it hurts me,

536
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:57,392
tell me the truth."

537
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:58,895
They'll say, "how stupid...

538
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:01,219
How stupid is the man I'm with."

539
00:24:01,344 --> 00:24:04,116
You lie, lie, lie.

540
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:05,945
Now I'm not talking about
lying about cheating,

541
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:07,117
lying about other women.

542
00:24:07,137 --> 00:24:08,221
I'm talking about little things

543
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:09,324
that you have to lie about.

544
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:10,635
All those little things
they ask you.

545
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:11,931
All kind of stupid stuff.

546
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,771
Stupid things.

547
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:15,392
"Do you like this movie?"

548
00:24:15,517 --> 00:24:16,793
"No, I hate the notebook.

549
00:24:16,813 --> 00:24:18,599
"I hate it! I hate it!

550
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:21,633
"It's not even real.

551
00:24:21,758 --> 00:24:22,758
It's not real!"

552
00:24:22,793 --> 00:24:24,375
Women love those kind of movies

553
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:26,374
where she has Alzheimer's

554
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:27,497
and she didn't know him anymore,

555
00:24:27,517 --> 00:24:28,875
and he wrote a book.

556
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,221
"Remember when I met you,
we were riding a bike."

557
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:32,486
In real life, he'd have
came to the hospital.

558
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:34,920
"You know me?" "No."

559
00:24:43,172 --> 00:24:45,931
It sounds wrong,
but it's the truth.

560
00:24:48,517 --> 00:24:49,895
See, these books and all...

561
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,572
Remember, it's all these books
and these talk shows

562
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:55,392
that women
who don't have a man...

563
00:24:55,517 --> 00:24:57,099
All these books and talks shows

564
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:58,788
with women who don't have a man

565
00:24:58,862 --> 00:25:00,852
telling you how to lose
the man you got,

566
00:25:00,872 --> 00:25:04,057
'cause they want you to be
just as lonely as they are.

567
00:25:06,586 --> 00:25:08,014
Men are so simple
we freak you out."

568
00:25:08,034 --> 00:25:09,048
We're so simple
you can't get to it.

569
00:25:09,068 --> 00:25:10,219
Men are simple.

570
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:11,926
We're so simple it bothers you.

571
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:15,012
You don't understand
the simple-ness of men.

572
00:25:15,137 --> 00:25:16,770
Okay, this is
how simple a man...

573
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:19,395
This is two men in a car
and he make a wrong turn.

574
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:20,943
"Dude! Man! Ha-ha!"

575
00:25:21,068 --> 00:25:23,116
That's it.

576
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:25,875
We're gonna turn left
and come back.

577
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,806
That's how simple. That's solid.

578
00:25:28,931 --> 00:25:30,309
This is you with your wife.

579
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:34,116
"Oh, god! Aah!

580
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,840
"Why would you turn there? Why?

581
00:25:37,965 --> 00:25:40,414
"Let's just go home.
I don't even want to go now.

582
00:25:40,434 --> 00:25:42,840
I don't even want to go."

583
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:46,461
The whole night is ruined
because I turned left.

584
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:50,172
"I can turn back around."
"No, I have a headache now."

585
00:25:57,068 --> 00:25:58,943
Men sometimes heard...
This is men.

586
00:25:59,068 --> 00:26:00,359
This is what we do.
This freaks you out.

587
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:01,635
This is a man acknowledging you.

588
00:26:01,655 --> 00:26:03,048
"Okay."
that means "I heard you."

589
00:26:03,068 --> 00:26:04,324
But that's not enough
for a woman.

590
00:26:04,344 --> 00:26:05,840
"Okay." "now say it back.

591
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:08,150
Say it back. Say what I said."

592
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:11,206
Oh, now it's an s.A.T. Test.
I have to pass the test.

593
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,357
This is two men
having a conversation.

594
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:18,115
"Man, you gonna go to the club?"

595
00:26:18,135 --> 00:26:21,546
"Yeah."

596
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,771
Done.

597
00:26:22,896 --> 00:26:24,773
"What time... what time
will you be there?

598
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:27,255
What? No, where you gonna go?
Well, how will you get there?

599
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:28,462
"If you don't know
where it's at,

600
00:26:28,482 --> 00:26:29,738
"why would you take me to go?

601
00:26:29,758 --> 00:26:30,911
"You don't even know
where you're going.

602
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:32,047
"You said yes.

603
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:34,162
You ain't even know
where you're going."

604
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:36,219
"I got a GPS."

605
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,668
Don't overcomplicate
the situation.

606
00:26:38,793 --> 00:26:40,047
Make it simple.

607
00:26:40,172 --> 00:26:42,219
What else, ladies?

608
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:43,943
Men don't want?

609
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:45,255
Men don't know how
to find anything.

610
00:26:45,275 --> 00:26:47,061
Like what?
I find everything I need.

611
00:26:47,081 --> 00:26:49,599
I can't find your stuff.

612
00:26:49,724 --> 00:26:52,978
I found everything
that belonged to me.

613
00:26:53,103 --> 00:26:55,603
Except for the one that you
moved to a better spot

614
00:26:55,623 --> 00:26:56,909
that makes more sense.

615
00:26:57,034 --> 00:26:59,024
When you moved my shoes
to a better spot

616
00:26:59,044 --> 00:27:01,526
'cause that's the spot
that you like.

617
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,735
What else, ladies?

618
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,461
Snoring!

619
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,357
Snoring.

620
00:27:11,482 --> 00:27:13,909
- Did he snore when he met you?
- No.

621
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:15,840
Did he snore when he met you?

622
00:27:15,965 --> 00:27:18,840
He didn't? Well, you sucked
the life out of him.

623
00:27:18,965 --> 00:27:20,965
He has no air.

624
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:30,012
He had a lot of air
when you met him.

625
00:27:30,137 --> 00:27:32,909
He used to sleep at night.

626
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:35,875
Now he's...

627
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,241
He's just trying
to survive the night.

628
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:45,288
He ain't snoring. He's dying.

629
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,530
A little bit each night.
A little bit.

630
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:52,047
Y'all call it sleep apnea.
We call it marriage.

631
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:55,000
There's not a man here
that's single with sleep apnea.

632
00:28:01,965 --> 00:28:03,700
Know what you get
sleep apnea from?

633
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,048
Men... see, young dudes,
you know...

634
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:06,806
Women hit you in your sleep.

635
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:08,702
A wife will tag you.

636
00:28:08,827 --> 00:28:11,327
She'll have a flashback
or something, look at you.

637
00:28:11,347 --> 00:28:12,150
Pow!

638
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:14,357
You'll wake up. "What the hell?"

639
00:28:14,482 --> 00:28:16,668
And she'll lie.
"Something bit me too.

640
00:28:16,793 --> 00:28:19,793
Did you get bit?
Something bit me too."

641
00:28:25,344 --> 00:28:28,116
I think it's a spider, a spider.

642
00:28:33,068 --> 00:28:34,428
And I want ladies
to know something.

643
00:28:34,448 --> 00:28:36,116
We do go through things
with you.

644
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:37,290
We do go through things
with you.

645
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,566
You don't even understand it.

646
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:39,635
We go through menopause.

647
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:41,288
Your menopause is our menopause.

648
00:28:41,308 --> 00:28:42,941
Your menopause is our menopause.

649
00:28:42,965 --> 00:28:44,668
You don't know it, but it is.

650
00:28:44,793 --> 00:28:46,528
'Cause your system
is so wacky now.

651
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:49,495
Your temperature system
is so wacky.

652
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,426
By my bed I got a parka
and some gym trunks.

653
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:55,051
'Cause I don't know
what temperature it's gonna be

654
00:28:55,071 --> 00:28:56,071
when I come home.

655
00:28:56,172 --> 00:28:58,599
And you have to go
with whatever she feels.

656
00:28:58,724 --> 00:29:01,323
"Aren't you freezing?
Aren't you freezing?

657
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,185
Snow is coming in the window."

658
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,379
"Oh, yeah, I'm freezing."

659
00:29:11,172 --> 00:29:14,392
Time to put on my gym trunks.

660
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:15,806
And then it changes.

661
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:17,186
Five minutes later.
"I'm burning up.

662
00:29:17,206 --> 00:29:18,599
I'm hot. I'm burning up."

663
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:21,771
Oh! Time to put on
the other suit.

664
00:29:21,896 --> 00:29:23,771
And then you sweat
out of nowhere.

665
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:25,771
Fffwww! Fffwww!

666
00:29:25,896 --> 00:29:27,427
It's not like sweat like this.

667
00:29:27,447 --> 00:29:31,063
It's "I thought she peed on me."

668
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:33,068
Say, "hey!" "I'm sweating."

669
00:29:39,172 --> 00:29:41,366
And the first time
a woman have a hot flash,

670
00:29:41,386 --> 00:29:43,042
it looks like a heart attack.

671
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:48,150
"You okay?"

672
00:29:48,275 --> 00:29:50,172
"Whew! I was burning up
for a second."

673
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:56,089
That's what I'm saying.
They don't need drugs.

674
00:29:56,109 --> 00:29:58,712
They need to bottle menopause
so you can shoot that.

675
00:30:02,241 --> 00:30:04,282
Something else, ladies.
Another question.

676
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,392
Anything about a man... yes.

677
00:30:06,517 --> 00:30:08,323
He's what? He's messy.

678
00:30:08,448 --> 00:30:10,393
Okay, that's a woman's...
What do we mean "messy"?

679
00:30:10,413 --> 00:30:12,862
My shirt's on the floor?
Did the house fall down?

680
00:30:12,882 --> 00:30:14,150
Did the children die?

681
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:15,288
Did the day go on?

682
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,046
Does he work?
Does he have a job?

683
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:20,012
Leave the shirt on the ground.
It ain't your shirt.

684
00:30:20,137 --> 00:30:23,840
Why are you stalking him
around the house following him?

685
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:26,312
That's his clothes.
Those are not your clothes.

686
00:30:26,332 --> 00:30:28,081
Look at this.
It don't bother me.

687
00:30:28,206 --> 00:30:30,553
Look at that, look at that.
It don't bother me.

688
00:30:30,573 --> 00:30:32,978
You can't take it.
You can't take that.

689
00:30:33,103 --> 00:30:35,034
Learn to do this.

690
00:30:40,068 --> 00:30:42,012
See how free I am?

691
00:30:42,137 --> 00:30:45,047
This is you. "Oh, god! Oh, god!

692
00:30:45,172 --> 00:30:48,047
"I am sick...
I am sick and tired

693
00:30:48,172 --> 00:30:50,495
of always picking up
everything!"

694
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:57,012
Well, quit picking it up.

695
00:30:57,137 --> 00:30:59,758
You wearing yourself out.

696
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,599
I left that shirt on the floor

697
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:05,645
'cause I'm gonna
wear it again tomorrow.

698
00:31:05,665 --> 00:31:09,597
It's right...Where I want it
as I go to the door.

699
00:31:12,448 --> 00:31:16,254
There's a method to the madness.

700
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:19,872
What else?
Okay, ladies, what else?

701
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:21,564
What else bothers you about us?

702
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:24,036
- 'Cause this is your night.
- The toilet seat!

703
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:25,056
The toilet seat.

704
00:31:25,103 --> 00:31:27,297
'Cause you couldn't put it
down by yourself.

705
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:29,779
You didn't see it was up.
You found the bathroom.

706
00:31:29,862 --> 00:31:31,546
How'd you miss
the toilet seat up?

707
00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:33,372
Did you take your eye
off the prize?

708
00:31:33,482 --> 00:31:35,599
Is that what you did?

709
00:31:35,724 --> 00:31:38,150
Did you get to the door
and walk in like this?

710
00:31:38,275 --> 00:31:39,909
"Oh, I'm almost there now.

711
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:43,495
"I guess it's down.
I guess it's down.

712
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,457
"I won't look,
'cause if he loves me,

713
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:48,154
I shouldn't have to look.
I shouldn't have to look."

714
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:49,174
It's your butt.

715
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,599
You fell in.
You should've looked.

716
00:31:51,724 --> 00:31:53,943
He left the seat up
because he loves you.

717
00:31:54,068 --> 00:31:55,840
Women don't even
understand that.

718
00:31:55,965 --> 00:31:59,219
If the seat is up, that means
I didn't pee on it.

719
00:31:59,344 --> 00:32:01,426
That's the best gift
I can give you.

720
00:32:01,551 --> 00:32:03,461
If the seat is up,

721
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:06,254
it means it's safe for you
to sit down.

722
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:08,081
If you ever walk in the bathroom

723
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:11,426
and the seat is down,
don't you trust it.

724
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:13,827
You might stick.

725
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:19,943
Yes, huh? Night humping.

726
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:21,495
Night humping.

727
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,978
- Night humping.
- It's called sleeping.

728
00:32:25,103 --> 00:32:26,840
- So he humps you at night.
- Yes.

729
00:32:26,965 --> 00:32:30,943
If you give him some sex,
he'd quit humping you.

730
00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:32,978
Just give him some sex.
A little bit.

731
00:32:33,103 --> 00:32:34,599
He don't want a lot.

732
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:37,122
Matter of fact, if you
get naked, he might freak

733
00:32:37,142 --> 00:32:38,599
he hasn't had some so long.

734
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:41,185
"Wait, what you doing?
Wh... hey!

735
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,360
I'm just humping.
Why you getting naked?"

736
00:32:48,172 --> 00:32:50,826
See, know what you do to make
a man stop doing stuff?

737
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,116
Do what he's asking for.

738
00:32:52,241 --> 00:32:53,823
Men... see, that's how men are.

739
00:32:53,862 --> 00:32:55,323
You want to freak him out,

740
00:32:55,448 --> 00:32:56,911
next time
when you get in the bed,

741
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:58,258
just get in the bed naked.

742
00:32:58,383 --> 00:32:59,608
"Come on, boy! Come on!"

743
00:32:59,628 --> 00:33:01,396
"Hey, hey, hey!

744
00:33:01,517 --> 00:33:04,012
"Wait a minute!

745
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:06,840
Wait a minute!"

746
00:33:06,965 --> 00:33:08,896
You'll scare him.

747
00:33:12,068 --> 00:33:15,943
You forgot how to use
your technique.

748
00:33:16,068 --> 00:33:17,548
Men act like they want stuff.

749
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:22,012
As soon as you do it,
"I wasn't ready for that."

750
00:33:22,137 --> 00:33:24,392
It'll scare him.

751
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:27,426
He'll be in the living room.
"I hope she's asleep."

752
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:29,206
"I'm still here!"

753
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:37,047
Oh, man!

754
00:33:37,172 --> 00:33:39,468
Isn't it funny how
the whole sex thing changes

755
00:33:39,488 --> 00:33:40,599
once you get married?

756
00:33:40,724 --> 00:33:42,255
For the first three
or four years, you have sex.

757
00:33:42,275 --> 00:33:43,738
Then you gotta work,
you gotta earn it.

758
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:45,595
You gotta earn it,
you gotta earn it.

759
00:33:45,615 --> 00:33:47,633
It's a trade. It's a trade.

760
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:48,943
They'll come in naked.

761
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,827
"I'll give you some
if you fix something."

762
00:33:56,724 --> 00:33:58,655
"I fixed the light."

763
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:04,185
You gotta trade out.

764
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,790
You start taking rain checks.

765
00:34:05,896 --> 00:34:08,116
If you date, it's all sexy.

766
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:09,702
You date. "What you doing?

767
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:11,460
You watching... What you doing?"

768
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:13,626
You get married.
"You wanna do something?"

769
00:34:13,646 --> 00:34:14,943
"Well, it's Tuesday.

770
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:16,324
"I wish you had said
something earlier.

771
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:18,589
"I didn't... we usually
do stuff on Thursday.

772
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:20,254
"I didn't know we were going...

773
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:23,482
"I need to set some dvrs.
We gotta tape our shows.

774
00:34:25,206 --> 00:34:27,219
Cant miss our shows."

775
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:33,323
"Get off schedule.
We can't get off schedule."

776
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:36,599
And then once you have a baby,
all the sex stop.

777
00:34:36,724 --> 00:34:38,048
Women freak out...
Something about women,

778
00:34:38,068 --> 00:34:39,117
once they have babies,
like they don't want

779
00:34:39,137 --> 00:34:40,770
the baby to know
they was freaky.

780
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:43,461
"The baby will see."

781
00:34:43,586 --> 00:34:46,185
The baby's a month old.

782
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,810
Man can have sex with a baby
looking right at him.

783
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,943
"Ha ha!

784
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:51,911
"Who's your daddy?
I'm everybody's daddy.

785
00:34:51,931 --> 00:34:53,513
"I'm your daddy. I'm her daddy.

786
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:54,891
I'm everybody's daddy."

787
00:35:00,655 --> 00:35:03,978
Women freak out on that stuff.

788
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:05,738
Some of y'all got kids
at your house, man,

789
00:35:05,758 --> 00:35:07,289
that messed up your love life.

790
00:35:07,413 --> 00:35:08,944
Done messed up your love life.

791
00:35:08,964 --> 00:35:10,753
"Shh! The kids'll come in.

792
00:35:10,827 --> 00:35:12,840
Shh! Shh!"

793
00:35:12,965 --> 00:35:14,751
You learn to have,
like, static sex.

794
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:16,254
"Okay." "you're moving."

795
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:19,840
"No, I swear I'm not moving.
Got asthma. I was breathing."

796
00:35:19,965 --> 00:35:21,116
It's your house.

797
00:35:21,241 --> 00:35:22,909
Those kids don't pay
for nothing.

798
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:25,288
Take your house back.

799
00:35:25,413 --> 00:35:26,668
Don't have quiet sex.

800
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:29,081
Keep the door open.

801
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:30,941
Be loud.
They'll only come in once.

802
00:35:30,961 --> 00:35:32,875
"Aah! Aah!"

803
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,357
And they'll never come back.

804
00:35:35,482 --> 00:35:37,357
Now you got your house back.

805
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:39,943
That's what you do.

806
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,359
Now I want to help y'all.

807
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:46,876
Who got grown folks
at their house?

808
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,359
Who got grown kids,
can't get 'em out the house?

809
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,083
Got grown kids,
can't get 'em out the house?

810
00:35:50,103 --> 00:35:51,842
I'm gonna help you.
Now they're gonna be damaged.

811
00:35:51,862 --> 00:35:53,189
This is gonna Jack 'em up.

812
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:55,426
But they will leave
your house tonight.

813
00:35:55,551 --> 00:35:59,564
You and your husband
walk around naked and have sex.

814
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:02,461
Grown kids can't take
their parents having sex.

815
00:36:02,586 --> 00:36:03,943
It freaks them out.

816
00:36:04,068 --> 00:36:06,048
While they're eating breakfast,
come naked into the kitchen.

817
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:07,738
"How long you gonna be here?
We gonna use that table."

818
00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:10,737
"Oh, god, daddy!

819
00:36:10,862 --> 00:36:12,978
That's nasty, daddy!"

820
00:36:13,103 --> 00:36:16,875
Smack your wife on the butt.
"Your mama's a freak."

821
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,172
They will run out of your house.

822
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:28,633
We are... we are what we are.
We can't help it.

823
00:36:28,758 --> 00:36:30,117
And then we get into
relationships and things change.

824
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:31,428
You get in relationships...

825
00:36:31,448 --> 00:36:33,014
That's why I tell people,
before you have kids

826
00:36:33,034 --> 00:36:34,185
travel, see the world.

827
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,980
When you first get together,
go places.

828
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,359
'Cause once you have children,

829
00:36:37,379 --> 00:36:38,462
you're gonna go
to Chuck E. Cheese,

830
00:36:38,482 --> 00:36:39,978
that's all you're going.

831
00:36:40,103 --> 00:36:41,531
That's your Europe,
that's your France,

832
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:43,286
that's your...
That's your Bermuda,

833
00:36:43,306 --> 00:36:45,564
Chuck E. Cheese.

834
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:48,138
There's people here
who are over 50 with no kids,

835
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:49,262
they don't look old.

836
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:51,420
Look at people with no kids.
No wrinkles.

837
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,073
They just sit there,
"oh, my god,

838
00:36:53,093 --> 00:36:55,323
we're going
to Jamaica next week."

839
00:36:55,448 --> 00:36:56,564
And people with kids:

840
00:36:56,689 --> 00:36:58,373
"You don't know the joy!

841
00:36:58,393 --> 00:37:00,876
You don't...
You don't know the joy!"

842
00:37:03,517 --> 00:37:05,668
Trying to make you have kids.

843
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:09,116
"You need some kids!

844
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:11,896
Look how happy I am. Shut up!"

845
00:37:18,965 --> 00:37:22,702
Man, 'cause kids
change everything.

846
00:37:22,827 --> 00:37:25,185
Everything. Everything.

847
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,806
Where my people in their 20s?

848
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:28,819
Where my people in their 20s?
You 20s?

849
00:37:30,724 --> 00:37:32,012
Leave your house.

850
00:37:32,137 --> 00:37:34,323
Move out!

851
00:37:34,448 --> 00:37:35,943
Move out!

852
00:37:36,068 --> 00:37:37,357
I know times are tight.

853
00:37:37,482 --> 00:37:39,013
Don't move back to save money.

854
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:41,477
That's how we save money...
With you out.

855
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,745
As soon as times get tight,
y'all come back.

856
00:37:45,068 --> 00:37:47,288
"It's tough out here. I gotta...

857
00:37:47,413 --> 00:37:48,633
I gotta regroup."

858
00:37:48,758 --> 00:37:51,702
We're trying to regroup too!

859
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:53,715
Don't let your kids
back in the house.

860
00:37:53,735 --> 00:37:55,426
Crack the door.
"Hey, what's up?"

861
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:58,702
"Mama, it's me."
"I know, I know, I see you.

862
00:37:58,827 --> 00:38:00,014
"I'm gonna tell your dad
you're here.

863
00:38:00,034 --> 00:38:01,323
"Jennifer's here!

864
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:02,254
"Back up, back up.

865
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:04,114
"We gonna come out
and talk to you.

866
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:05,168
Back up."

867
00:38:15,517 --> 00:38:16,806
It's crazy, man.

868
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:19,599
And y'all move back home,
and you pissed off.

869
00:38:19,724 --> 00:38:21,255
Mad you even have to be there.

870
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:22,329
"I hate it here!"

871
00:38:22,363 --> 00:38:24,840
You're supposed to.

872
00:38:24,965 --> 00:38:25,965
I get my parents.

873
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,735
I understand
my mother and dad now.

874
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:29,150
I got... I see why they...

875
00:38:29,275 --> 00:38:31,152
They made our life so hard
when we were young.

876
00:38:31,172 --> 00:38:33,570
They want you to hate it
so much, you say stuff:

877
00:38:33,695 --> 00:38:34,767
"I can't wait to go!"

878
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:37,357
"There you go.

879
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,965
I'm gonna help you."

880
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:44,083
And kids are mad now,
don't even have chores.

881
00:38:44,103 --> 00:38:46,048
Know what's a chore now?
Cleaning your room.

882
00:38:46,068 --> 00:38:48,081
That ain't no chore.
You live there.

883
00:38:48,206 --> 00:38:49,635
You supposed...
Chores is like...

884
00:38:49,655 --> 00:38:52,666
My dad had chores like, "help me
put in a hot water heater."

885
00:38:52,686 --> 00:38:53,840
I'm eight years old.

886
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,292
"Don't you drop it on me."

887
00:38:55,312 --> 00:38:57,633
"I can't lift it!
Daddy, I can't!"

888
00:38:57,758 --> 00:39:00,875
"Don't you drop
that hot water heater on me."

889
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,978
That's how you learn stuff.

890
00:39:05,103 --> 00:39:06,787
Then he... he taught me
about gas.

891
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:08,137
"Light the pilot light."

892
00:39:08,157 --> 00:39:09,586
Whoof! Took the eyebrow off.

893
00:39:09,689 --> 00:39:11,137
"What'd you learn?"

894
00:39:13,724 --> 00:39:14,724
"What'd you learn?"

895
00:39:18,517 --> 00:39:20,875
My father didn't put
no sockets in the plugs.

896
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,842
He didn't have no
little sockets in the wall.

897
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:25,158
He said, "take this knife,
stick it in there."

898
00:39:25,178 --> 00:39:25,978
Unh!

899
00:39:26,103 --> 00:39:28,564
"That's called electricity.

900
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:31,254
"And I bet you won't
do that again.

901
00:39:31,379 --> 00:39:32,910
"Now show your little brother.

902
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,788
Show your little brother."

903
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:37,172
That's how you learn stuff.

904
00:39:42,068 --> 00:39:43,379
Man.

905
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:48,807
It's just... it's just craz...
Being a parent.

906
00:39:48,827 --> 00:39:51,393
I tell young people, "man,
cut your parents some slack."

907
00:39:51,413 --> 00:39:53,083
'Cause you gonna be
just as jacked up.

908
00:39:53,103 --> 00:39:54,566
I know you think you're gonna
be a better parent.

909
00:39:54,586 --> 00:39:56,048
I know all y'all, "I can't
wait till I'm a parent."

910
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:57,395
No, we can't wait, either.

911
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,612
We hope you have kids,
so your life sucks,

912
00:39:59,632 --> 00:40:00,357
just like us.

913
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:03,012
We can't wait for you
to have kids

914
00:40:03,137 --> 00:40:05,076
so that one time
you come to the house,

915
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:06,528
"I don't know what to do."

916
00:40:06,548 --> 00:40:09,254
Ha ha! Don't bring him here.

917
00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:11,012
"I already had one
just like him.

918
00:40:11,068 --> 00:40:12,418
I don't need another one."

919
00:40:15,826 --> 00:40:17,255
How many y'all grandparents?

920
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:18,980
How many y'all
are grandparents in here?

921
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,152
They try to drop the kids...

922
00:40:20,172 --> 00:40:21,428
They try to drop
the grandkids at your house.

923
00:40:21,448 --> 00:40:23,462
Like you want that.
They show up like this.

924
00:40:23,482 --> 00:40:25,738
"We're so worn out, we just want
to go have a dinner.

925
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:26,909
Can you watch 'em?"

926
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:28,566
Oh, next time they do that,
okay, watch them.

927
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:30,729
Give them some red bull,
some cotton candy.

928
00:40:30,854 --> 00:40:32,005
Fire that child up.

929
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,530
Have that child high.

930
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:37,840
"Ma! Ma! Mama, mama!

931
00:40:37,965 --> 00:40:39,911
"Mama! Grandma, grandma,
grandma, grandma, grandma!

932
00:40:39,931 --> 00:40:41,909
Mama, grandma, grandma,
mama, mama!"

933
00:40:42,034 --> 00:40:44,344
I bet you won't
bring 'em here no more.

934
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:52,310
Gonna have a.D.D.H.D.
When they get out of here.

935
00:40:55,862 --> 00:40:57,978
Now, what is it?
Every kid got a.D.D.

936
00:40:58,103 --> 00:41:01,219
Every kid!
Every kid got a.D.D. Now.

937
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:02,219
"Oh, he's got a.D.D."

938
00:41:02,344 --> 00:41:03,737
"All he did was stand up!"

939
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:06,254
"Oh, oh, he's got a.D.D."

940
00:41:06,379 --> 00:41:07,859
"What'd he do? ""He stood up.

941
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:09,534
No kid stands up in this class."

942
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,603
If they played outside,
they wouldn't have no a.D.D.

943
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:16,847
They wouldn't have it.

944
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:18,615
They wouldn't have it!
Go outside!

945
00:41:18,635 --> 00:41:20,461
That gets all that out of you.

946
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:25,116
My father... I had a.D.D.,
but there was no name for it.

947
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:26,568
They had a different name:

948
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:28,495
"Run around this house again.

949
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,806
"Run around
this house one more time

950
00:41:30,931 --> 00:41:32,461
"like you lost your mind.

951
00:41:32,586 --> 00:41:34,034
Now, sit down."

952
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,068
"Quit shakin'!"

953
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:44,172
"Get yourself together, boy!"

954
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:49,737
He cured me of my a.D.D.
With no drugs.

955
00:41:49,862 --> 00:41:52,357
So I could exist in society.

956
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:02,290
Oh, man, I'm telling you,
dude, it's...

957
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,300
It's just we...
We over-coddle our kids,

958
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,633
we give them too much,

959
00:42:05,758 --> 00:42:07,393
and then we wonder
what's wrong with them.

960
00:42:07,413 --> 00:42:09,635
We Jack 'em up, then we say,
"what's wrong with you?"

961
00:42:09,655 --> 00:42:12,053
We Jack 'em up and say,
"what's wrong with you?"

962
00:42:12,073 --> 00:42:14,426
"I'm jacked up! I'm jacked up!"

963
00:42:14,551 --> 00:42:17,460
Kids turn 16 like that means
you're supposed to get a car.

964
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:19,635
Kids turn 16 like... "I'm 16."
"That's good.

965
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:21,704
"If I have a heart attack,
you get me out the way,

966
00:42:21,724 --> 00:42:23,510
"and you drive me
to the hospital...

967
00:42:23,635 --> 00:42:25,013
"'Cause that's the only way

968
00:42:25,118 --> 00:42:27,392
you're gonna drive my car
at 16."

969
00:42:27,517 --> 00:42:29,099
And they don't just want a car.

970
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,960
They want a car that's new.

971
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:32,840
If it's older
than two years old...

972
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:34,802
"Oh, that...
That's three years old!"

973
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,530
Now, I was coming up,
it was in the last 15 years...

974
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,392
That's a new car.

975
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:42,495
If it's in the last century,
that's a good car!

976
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,840
You don't need all the doors.

977
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:49,047
Somebody gotta hang on.

978
00:42:53,965 --> 00:42:55,392
They get an attitude at you

979
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:57,048
like you supposed to be mad
'cause they gonna walk.

980
00:42:57,068 --> 00:42:59,288
"I'll just walk!" "Okay."

981
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:02,495
But you know what y'all do?
"No, no, I'll take you."

982
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,840
I ain't getting up
'cause you made the team.

983
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:08,219
You shouldn't have ran so fast.

984
00:43:08,344 --> 00:43:10,896
How many of y'all dread
when your kids make a team?

985
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:12,323
You made the team? Damn!

986
00:43:12,448 --> 00:43:14,943
That's football andbasketball!

987
00:43:15,068 --> 00:43:17,254
I ain't gonna sleep till June!

988
00:43:17,379 --> 00:43:18,807
How many of y'all got
little kids,

989
00:43:18,827 --> 00:43:20,185
you be in a tournament,

990
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,300
and you're hoping
he miss the last shot?

991
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,150
"Don't make it, don't make it!
Whoo! Aw.

992
00:43:26,275 --> 00:43:28,668
"Oh, we so sad y'all lost.

993
00:43:28,793 --> 00:43:31,530
But we gonna sleep next week."

994
00:43:31,655 --> 00:43:33,150
Now, you a bad parent

995
00:43:33,275 --> 00:43:35,265
'cause you forgot
it was your snack day.

996
00:43:35,285 --> 00:43:37,737
It's your snack day,
and you didn't bring snacks.

997
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:39,342
You supposed to bring snacks.

998
00:43:39,362 --> 00:43:40,737
He ain't bring snacks!

999
00:43:40,862 --> 00:43:43,943
Y'all lost.
You don't need no snacks.

1000
00:43:44,068 --> 00:43:46,081
You need to go home.

1001
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,771
And now every kid gets an award.

1002
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:51,943
Someone got to suck.
That's what makes you stronger.

1003
00:43:52,068 --> 00:43:54,185
Someone got to suck.

1004
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:56,012
They got a trophy for everybody.

1005
00:43:56,137 --> 00:43:58,392
They got a trophy called,
"you try hard.

1006
00:43:58,517 --> 00:44:00,219
You try hard."

1007
00:44:00,344 --> 00:44:03,426
That means you suck!

1008
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:05,541
You try hard.
This "the try hard" award.

1009
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:07,323
We have a special award
for Johnny.

1010
00:44:07,448 --> 00:44:09,438
Johnny can't run or shoot.
He's no good.

1011
00:44:09,551 --> 00:44:12,392
He clumsy.
But I wish I had nine of him.

1012
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:14,737
I wish I had nine johnnies!

1013
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:16,495
No, you don't.

1014
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,253
You want 1 LeBron and 20 of him.

1015
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,530
You don't care.

1016
00:44:20,655 --> 00:44:22,840
There's no "I" in team.
Oh, yeah.

1017
00:44:22,965 --> 00:44:26,116
You hope you got a "I."
There's me.

1018
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:27,426
Think about it.

1019
00:44:27,551 --> 00:44:29,490
All this stuff
is so fake about sports.

1020
00:44:29,615 --> 00:44:31,809
"We just want...
I just want good teamwork."

1021
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:34,392
No, you want somebody 6'9"
to jump out the gym.

1022
00:44:34,517 --> 00:44:36,711
'Cause you want
your team to win, don't you?

1023
00:44:36,827 --> 00:44:39,255
You want your team to win.
There's not one family here...

1024
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:41,290
"Our team is not that good,
but they all graduated.

1025
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,771
They're smart,
and they're good people."

1026
00:44:43,896 --> 00:44:46,909
Well, you need to find
a dumb one that can play...

1027
00:44:47,034 --> 00:44:49,702
So y'all can win some games.

1028
00:44:49,827 --> 00:44:51,255
Lot of you women make a mistake

1029
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:53,083
trying to be a best friend
with your kids.

1030
00:44:53,103 --> 00:44:54,736
Your kids
ain't your best friend.

1031
00:44:54,756 --> 00:44:56,737
Your best friend can't be seven!

1032
00:44:58,655 --> 00:44:59,842
And some of you ladies are like,

1033
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:01,531
"people think me and my
daughter are sisters."

1034
00:45:01,551 --> 00:45:03,184
Oh, that's
every daughter's dream

1035
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:04,993
to look like
her 55-year-old mama.

1036
00:45:05,013 --> 00:45:07,495
She gonna need therapy
all her life.

1037
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,875
Let yourself get old.
Let yourself get old.

1038
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,909
Give your child a chance.

1039
00:45:13,034 --> 00:45:15,323
All this surgery,
losing your mind.

1040
00:45:15,448 --> 00:45:16,875
Even if you look good,

1041
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,296
'cause women at 40, 50, 60,
y'all working out,

1042
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:20,150
y'all look good,

1043
00:45:20,275 --> 00:45:21,566
but you can't wear them pants
that say juicy.

1044
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:23,012
Stop that.

1045
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,599
You 60 years old.

1046
00:45:24,724 --> 00:45:28,047
Take them pants off and give
'em back to your grandchild.

1047
00:45:28,172 --> 00:45:29,219
Juicy. I'm juicy.

1048
00:45:29,344 --> 00:45:31,530
I'm still juicy.

1049
00:45:34,241 --> 00:45:36,048
And some of y'all try and
put your butt in the pants,

1050
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:37,650
you can't even see the letters.

1051
00:45:37,724 --> 00:45:39,530
I saw "u, I."
I thought it was ui.

1052
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:42,909
The "j" was over here.
Oh...Oh...Oh!

1053
00:45:43,034 --> 00:45:44,980
Oh, juicy. I thought ui.
I didn't know what that was,

1054
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,943
I thought it was a university.

1055
00:45:47,068 --> 00:45:49,081
Some of the letters was missing.

1056
00:45:49,206 --> 00:45:51,357
They were on the side.

1057
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:56,150
All this surgery
doesn't fool anybody.

1058
00:45:56,275 --> 00:45:58,469
Ladies, you earned being old.
You earned it.

1059
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,116
You earned it! You've earned it!

1060
00:46:01,241 --> 00:46:02,943
Be sexy.

1061
00:46:03,068 --> 00:46:05,926
I'm-a get my breasts lifted.
I'm-a get my breasts lifted.

1062
00:46:05,946 --> 00:46:09,028
You earned it. Drop 'em.
Put 'em in your pockets!

1063
00:46:12,551 --> 00:46:14,388
Foreplay.
Hide 'em from your husband.

1064
00:46:14,408 --> 00:46:15,909
"Where are they?

1065
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:18,081
"You put 'em
in your back pockets?

1066
00:46:18,206 --> 00:46:21,840
I couldn't even find 'em
this time."

1067
00:46:21,965 --> 00:46:26,172
Fold 'em up.

1068
00:46:30,931 --> 00:46:33,329
You've earned it.
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

1069
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:35,047
That's sexy still.

1070
00:46:35,172 --> 00:46:37,060
Everybody so worried
about being sexy,

1071
00:46:37,185 --> 00:46:39,303
getting their face...
Man, when you get that facelift,

1072
00:46:39,323 --> 00:46:40,495
everybody know!

1073
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,461
You just look old and tight.

1074
00:46:47,655 --> 00:46:51,461
Oh, you look so good.

1075
00:46:51,586 --> 00:46:53,359
Putting all that collagen
in your lips.

1076
00:46:53,379 --> 00:46:55,461
Everybody not supposed
to have big lips.

1077
00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:57,219
If you got little lips, face it.

1078
00:46:57,239 --> 00:46:58,701
You gotta have little lips!

1079
00:46:58,793 --> 00:47:03,840
Look like somebody
punched you in your face.

1080
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:06,564
Who told women that was sexy?

1081
00:47:06,689 --> 00:47:09,461
Men don't want that big lip
coming at 'em like that.

1082
00:47:09,586 --> 00:47:11,393
And then some women
try and save money.

1083
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:12,945
They suck the butt fat
out they butt

1084
00:47:12,965 --> 00:47:14,945
and they put it in their lips
so they get two for one.

1085
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:17,186
They suck the butt fat out,
so now your body all confused.

1086
00:47:17,206 --> 00:47:18,978
You don't know what to do.

1087
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:21,599
Girl, I'm tired.
I gotta sit down.

1088
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:28,323
Your body parts
don't know what to do!

1089
00:47:28,448 --> 00:47:31,633
You're all jacked up!

1090
00:47:31,758 --> 00:47:35,000
You get gas...
"Girl, I got gas."

1091
00:47:38,137 --> 00:47:40,034
Man!

1092
00:47:45,172 --> 00:47:47,117
Fallin' apart, man.
All I do is go to rehab.

1093
00:47:47,137 --> 00:47:49,025
Sometime you just let
something break.

1094
00:47:49,137 --> 00:47:51,433
I'm so tired of rehab,
I just let stuff break.

1095
00:47:51,482 --> 00:47:54,150
I just have a bad hand.
I don't care.

1096
00:47:54,275 --> 00:47:56,875
You don't need
all your body parts.

1097
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,684
As long as you got
one strong one,

1098
00:47:58,724 --> 00:48:00,943
you can drag the other one.

1099
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,875
It becomes your walk.

1100
00:48:10,758 --> 00:48:14,034
That's your old man walk.

1101
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,978
I don't run anywhere.

1102
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,737
I ain't never gonna run
again in my life.

1103
00:48:20,862 --> 00:48:22,152
I got a better chance
a car hittin' me

1104
00:48:22,172 --> 00:48:23,702
than me trying to run.

1105
00:48:23,827 --> 00:48:26,481
I try to run, my body like,
"give him a heart attack.

1106
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:28,185
He trying to run!"

1107
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:31,806
I got that little fake run.
I get one step off...

1108
00:48:34,827 --> 00:48:36,530
I got one move.

1109
00:48:36,655 --> 00:48:40,668
That's why I gotta wait
till the car almost get to me.

1110
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:43,909
I gotta time it just right.

1111
00:48:44,034 --> 00:48:46,392
Stuff start pullin'.
You pull your...

1112
00:48:46,517 --> 00:48:48,530
I pulled a hamstring.
I pulled a groin.

1113
00:48:48,655 --> 00:48:50,669
There's a muscle in the butt
called a piriformis muscle.

1114
00:48:50,689 --> 00:48:52,462
You won't learn about it
till you get old.

1115
00:48:52,482 --> 00:48:54,669
When you get old.
It's only the size of a walnut.

1116
00:48:54,689 --> 00:48:57,117
It's the size of a walnut
and it... you get sciatica.

1117
00:48:57,137 --> 00:48:59,635
It goes from the neck
down to the back of your knee.

1118
00:48:59,655 --> 00:49:01,135
You'll be standing somewhere.

1119
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:02,738
See, young people like this...
"What is that?"

1120
00:49:02,758 --> 00:49:04,150
Keep on living.

1121
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,012
Keep on living. You'll find out.

1122
00:49:06,137 --> 00:49:09,633
And it won't go out when you
doing something strenuous.

1123
00:49:09,758 --> 00:49:11,702
You'll be washin' your face.

1124
00:49:23,862 --> 00:49:28,344
I'm trying to push that button.
The button don't push.

1125
00:49:32,103 --> 00:49:34,116
Gettin' old is a trip.

1126
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:36,435
I want to apologize
to all the older people.

1127
00:49:36,455 --> 00:49:38,461
I used to laugh at y'all.

1128
00:49:38,586 --> 00:49:40,737
Well, it's not your fault.

1129
00:49:40,862 --> 00:49:43,771
I get it now.
I get it...I get it.

1130
00:49:43,896 --> 00:49:45,773
I get it why,
when the light turn green...

1131
00:49:45,793 --> 00:49:47,069
'Cause you gotta warm up.

1132
00:49:47,194 --> 00:49:48,878
You can't just jump
in the street.

1133
00:49:48,898 --> 00:49:51,564
You gotta be like...

1134
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:53,373
'Cause you been standing
too long.

1135
00:49:53,393 --> 00:49:54,737
You tighten up.

1136
00:49:54,862 --> 00:49:56,359
Getting a knee replaced
is no joke.

1137
00:49:56,379 --> 00:49:57,737
Getting a knee replaced.

1138
00:49:57,862 --> 00:50:00,048
Anybody had a knee replaced?
Had a knee replaced?

1139
00:50:00,068 --> 00:50:01,219
Had a knee replaced?

1140
00:50:01,344 --> 00:50:03,079
Dude, I'm gonna tell you
something.

1141
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:05,909
I didn't believe in drugs
till I got my knee replaced.

1142
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:09,012
God put drugs here
for a reason in small amounts.

1143
00:50:09,137 --> 00:50:10,771
You should be able to have some.

1144
00:50:10,896 --> 00:50:12,564
Darvocet. I keep two.

1145
00:50:12,689 --> 00:50:13,806
At all times.

1146
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:16,702
I was so high...
They had me on the intravenous.

1147
00:50:16,827 --> 00:50:17,909
They said it was like

1148
00:50:18,034 --> 00:50:19,290
seven times more powerful
than morphine.

1149
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:21,288
They had it stuck in me, a drip.

1150
00:50:21,413 --> 00:50:25,323
I woke up. I was like...

1151
00:50:25,448 --> 00:50:29,081
I said, "I can leave today.
I feel so good!"

1152
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:30,992
Now I see why people
who are junkies

1153
00:50:31,117 --> 00:50:32,440
move their fingers a lot.

1154
00:50:32,565 --> 00:50:35,806
I was like...

1155
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:40,426
I was so messed up,

1156
00:50:40,551 --> 00:50:42,978
I had a catheter in me...
I didn't know.

1157
00:50:43,103 --> 00:50:47,047
I looked at my wife...
"I ain't peed in five days."

1158
00:50:47,172 --> 00:50:50,047
"Oh, yes, you did."
"Where? Where?"

1159
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,806
I thought it was a tube
that was feeding me.

1160
00:50:52,931 --> 00:50:54,600
I thought they had
wrapped it around my leg.

1161
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,172
I was gonna show my daughter,
"look what they got!"

1162
00:50:57,192 --> 00:51:01,737
My wife jumped on me. "Hey!"

1163
00:51:01,862 --> 00:51:04,495
And then they make you
leave the next day.

1164
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:07,012
They want that hospital bed
the next day.

1165
00:51:07,137 --> 00:51:09,433
I'm laying there.
I just had my knee replaced.

1166
00:51:09,453 --> 00:51:10,743
"So how you feel?
You feel like walking today?"

1167
00:51:10,763 --> 00:51:13,806
I was like...
"I don't know if I can...

1168
00:51:13,931 --> 00:51:17,633
I don't think
I should go home yet!"

1169
00:51:17,758 --> 00:51:19,704
And all you people
who work at a hospital,

1170
00:51:19,724 --> 00:51:21,116
all you nurses and doctors,

1171
00:51:21,241 --> 00:51:24,099
when people are clicking
for medication, I ain't playing!

1172
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:25,357
Bring some!

1173
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:28,599
I ain't playing with you!

1174
00:51:28,724 --> 00:51:30,918
I hear you out there
at the nurse station...

1175
00:51:30,938 --> 00:51:32,426
"There he go again.

1176
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:34,840
Mr. Clicky.
Here come Mr. Clicky."

1177
00:51:41,448 --> 00:51:43,600
That's why you gotta be
with a woman in her 50s.

1178
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,911
She always got medication.

1179
00:51:44,931 --> 00:51:46,773
Women in their 50s
always got some Vicodin.

1180
00:51:46,793 --> 00:51:48,117
They always...
They got some hidden

1181
00:51:48,137 --> 00:51:49,840
in a certs or sucrets box.

1182
00:51:49,965 --> 00:51:51,875
It's not in regular
medication boxes.

1183
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,296
And they always lie to you.
"This my last one.

1184
00:51:54,316 --> 00:51:58,150
"I know you got more."
"No, this my last...

1185
00:51:58,275 --> 00:52:01,461
Just enough for me.
I had just enough for me."

1186
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:08,495
Stingy with the drugs.

1187
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:11,290
Now, in California, everybody
get a medical marijuana...

1188
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:12,807
Everybody got...
Everybody got it...

1189
00:52:12,827 --> 00:52:14,186
Look at 'em, look at 'em.

1190
00:52:14,206 --> 00:52:15,840
Saying yeah! They can't...

1191
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:18,014
They can't legalize...
So just think about marijuana.

1192
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:19,876
People go, "well, marijuana's
not a drug.

1193
00:52:19,896 --> 00:52:21,376
It just makes you feel good."

1194
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:23,440
Have you ever seen somebody
smoke dope?

1195
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,806
You ever been around a room,
everybody high?

1196
00:52:25,931 --> 00:52:27,564
They talk about
what we gonna do.

1197
00:52:27,689 --> 00:52:28,689
It never get done.

1198
00:52:28,758 --> 00:52:30,737
"Man..."

1199
00:52:30,862 --> 00:52:32,150
"Man, we gonna...

1200
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:34,150
"Start a production...

1201
00:52:34,275 --> 00:52:36,288
"We gonna do a production com...

1202
00:52:36,413 --> 00:52:39,943
Ha ha ha!"

1203
00:52:40,068 --> 00:52:41,242
Don't nothing get done,

1204
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:42,943
'cause you couldn't
find the pen.

1205
00:52:42,963 --> 00:52:46,357
"Somebody get a pen,
write this down."

1206
00:52:46,482 --> 00:52:50,702
"They don't have no pens.
Ain't no more pens."

1207
00:52:50,827 --> 00:52:52,715
One thing
that'll never happen to you.

1208
00:52:52,735 --> 00:52:55,633
You'll never get carjacked
by somebody smoking dope.

1209
00:52:55,758 --> 00:52:57,221
A crack addict
will try and carjack you.

1210
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:58,772
A heroin addict will try that.

1211
00:52:58,896 --> 00:53:01,754
See, a crack addict will try
to carjack you with nothin'.

1212
00:53:01,774 --> 00:53:04,633
Hey!

1213
00:53:04,758 --> 00:53:09,426
Dude, you gotta do something.
You gotta bring something.

1214
00:53:09,551 --> 00:53:13,254
They're so messed up,
they'll just try.

1215
00:53:13,379 --> 00:53:15,982
You'll never get carjacked
by somebody smoking dope.

1216
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:20,426
"Dude...wait, man,
where you goin'? Wait!

1217
00:53:20,551 --> 00:53:21,943
"Ha ha ha!

1218
00:53:22,068 --> 00:53:24,495
Wait!
Let me have those cheetos."

1219
00:53:30,758 --> 00:53:32,083
If you drink,
don't go to the zoo,

1220
00:53:32,103 --> 00:53:33,702
'cause you do dumb stuff.

1221
00:53:33,827 --> 00:53:35,945
They need to quit serving
alcohol at the zoo.

1222
00:53:35,965 --> 00:53:38,619
There's always some drunk person
jump in with a lion.

1223
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:39,943
That's beyond alcohol.

1224
00:53:40,068 --> 00:53:42,806
You must have cut that
with something else.

1225
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:43,943
And your friends,

1226
00:53:44,068 --> 00:53:46,047
they not supposed to drink
with you.

1227
00:53:46,172 --> 00:53:49,392
Somebody gotta be sober.
"Hey, John! That's a lion!"

1228
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:52,392
"I know!

1229
00:53:52,517 --> 00:53:53,392
"Here, kitty, kitty.

1230
00:53:53,517 --> 00:53:56,323
Here, kitty."

1231
00:53:56,448 --> 00:53:58,083
You ever see the pictures
when they show people

1232
00:53:58,103 --> 00:53:59,633
jumping in with the animals?

1233
00:53:59,758 --> 00:54:01,531
The animal's like this,
"oh, he must be messed up."

1234
00:54:01,551 --> 00:54:02,911
'Cause they don't attack
right away.

1235
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:04,116
They're like...

1236
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,840
"Did he just jump
over this fence here?

1237
00:54:06,965 --> 00:54:09,495
I'm-a give him
30 seconds to leave."

1238
00:54:12,068 --> 00:54:15,702
"I gotta bite him, I gotta rep.
I got to attack him."

1239
00:54:15,827 --> 00:54:17,001
Other folks be jumping.

1240
00:54:17,068 --> 00:54:21,254
All kind of monkeys
be jumping up in here.

1241
00:54:24,793 --> 00:54:27,737
They have this video,
if you go on YouTube,

1242
00:54:27,862 --> 00:54:29,254
called Christian the lion.

1243
00:54:29,379 --> 00:54:31,216
And they got Whitney Houston
playing,

1244
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,840
sing I always love you.

1245
00:54:32,965 --> 00:54:34,599
It's about a dude,
him and his...

1246
00:54:34,724 --> 00:54:36,150
See, never black folks.

1247
00:54:36,275 --> 00:54:37,704
All these black people
in Africa,

1248
00:54:37,724 --> 00:54:39,306
we never go look for the lions.

1249
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,880
We take you to him,
and we stand outside the cave.

1250
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,461
"He's in there."

1251
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:47,015
We stand outside with a gun.

1252
00:54:47,035 --> 00:54:50,047
If he comes out,
he's a dead lion.

1253
00:54:50,172 --> 00:54:52,264
"Oh, no, don't shoot him.
Don't shoot him.

1254
00:54:52,284 --> 00:54:54,461
It was my fault.
I walked up on him."

1255
00:54:54,586 --> 00:54:57,254
I'm-a shoot both of y'all!

1256
00:54:57,379 --> 00:54:59,806
You brought him out the cave
to me!

1257
00:54:59,931 --> 00:55:01,842
They raised this little lion
called Christian.

1258
00:55:01,862 --> 00:55:03,359
They show him,
he's running in slow motion,

1259
00:55:03,379 --> 00:55:05,083
he's running with the lion,
they're kicking the ball.

1260
00:55:05,103 --> 00:55:07,014
Now the lion, they released
him out to the pride

1261
00:55:07,034 --> 00:55:08,412
and now he's with his wife,

1262
00:55:08,432 --> 00:55:09,688
and his wife has never
met the people.

1263
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:11,495
And he said,
"we want to find him

1264
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,599
and see if he still knows us."

1265
00:55:13,724 --> 00:55:15,867
And they say,
"you wanna look for the lion?

1266
00:55:15,887 --> 00:55:17,943
And his wife
who don't know you?" "Yes!"

1267
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:19,564
They made him sign papers...

1268
00:55:19,689 --> 00:55:21,943
Well, if you die,
it ain't on us.

1269
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:24,109
And we need our money
up front right now.

1270
00:55:24,234 --> 00:55:25,867
So they're walking with a stick,

1271
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:28,063
and Whitney Houston,
she's singing.

1272
00:55:28,137 --> 00:55:31,392
This lion says, "what the hell?"

1273
00:55:31,517 --> 00:55:32,895
And then it freaked me out.

1274
00:55:32,915 --> 00:55:35,116
The lion runs at him
and jumps up on him

1275
00:55:35,241 --> 00:55:36,978
and hugs him in a bear hug.

1276
00:55:37,103 --> 00:55:39,552
Hugs him in a bear hug,
and his wife like this...

1277
00:55:39,572 --> 00:55:41,875
"Oh, we ain't gonna kill
this one?"

1278
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,600
The wife come over.
They're hugging.

1279
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,393
They're rubbing the wife.
They're hugging and playing.

1280
00:55:45,413 --> 00:55:48,220
The lion like this, "man,
I been wondering where you at!

1281
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,978
"Man, I been wondering
where you at!

1282
00:55:51,103 --> 00:55:54,909
I'm out here with these lions.
I can't find you!"

1283
00:55:55,034 --> 00:55:57,432
And I'm like this...
"That's the dumbest thing."

1284
00:55:57,517 --> 00:55:59,252
People were crying.
I ain't crying.

1285
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:01,219
That's a fool!

1286
00:56:01,344 --> 00:56:03,844
'Cause it could have been
a whole different video.

1287
00:56:03,864 --> 00:56:05,049
"Who the hell is that?"

1288
00:56:05,174 --> 00:56:08,392
"I don't know... he keeps
shouting my name, Christian."

1289
00:56:08,517 --> 00:56:09,392
He stood there like this.

1290
00:56:09,517 --> 00:56:12,357
Wha-ack!

1291
00:56:12,482 --> 00:56:17,103
And a head woulda
rolled down the pride.

1292
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,978
I don't go on safaris in Africa.

1293
00:56:21,103 --> 00:56:22,599
I'm not goin' on safari.

1294
00:56:22,724 --> 00:56:25,020
Three's a reason
those animals live out there.

1295
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,702
You don't see animals in a truck

1296
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:30,012
coming through neighborhoods...
"The people live here.

1297
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:34,219
They're dangerous if you
see them coming outside."

1298
00:56:34,344 --> 00:56:35,876
Where I live,
we got enough animals.

1299
00:56:35,896 --> 00:56:37,840
We got mountain lions,
we got bobcats.

1300
00:56:37,965 --> 00:56:40,255
We got black widow spiders.
We got rattlesnakes.

1301
00:56:40,275 --> 00:56:42,359
See, as soon as we leave
the neighborhood, black folks,

1302
00:56:42,379 --> 00:56:44,152
and we wanna move out
to the suburbs,

1303
00:56:44,172 --> 00:56:45,876
there's a whole new kinda
animal we got to deal with.

1304
00:56:45,896 --> 00:56:47,566
I'm gonna get out the hood.
I'm-a live with nature.

1305
00:56:47,586 --> 00:56:49,393
I wanna live with nature,
and you gotta respect nature

1306
00:56:49,413 --> 00:56:50,909
and nature will respect you.

1307
00:56:51,034 --> 00:56:52,116
No, it don't.

1308
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:55,806
Sometime it be hidin'
in the kitchen.

1309
00:57:00,689 --> 00:57:02,426
This fool...

1310
00:57:02,551 --> 00:57:04,875
Thought he was raisin'
a baby cat, a bobcat.

1311
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,909
He thought he found a cat.
It was a bobcat he found.

1312
00:57:08,034 --> 00:57:10,688
And he was feeding the cat,
you know, milk and stuff,

1313
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:13,599
and the cat was like this,
"I need a sandwich."

1314
00:57:13,724 --> 00:57:17,012
So he was giving it cat food.

1315
00:57:17,137 --> 00:57:19,357
I think it was
the Rachael ray...

1316
00:57:19,482 --> 00:57:22,391
The Rachael ray cat food.
It had the Rachael ray cat food.

1317
00:57:22,411 --> 00:57:24,633
And the cat snatched
the hamburger from him.

1318
00:57:24,758 --> 00:57:26,391
So he said, "you don't take it,"

1319
00:57:26,411 --> 00:57:28,305
and he scratched
my man's face up.

1320
00:57:28,379 --> 00:57:31,943
And then the firemen came out.
"It's a bobcat."

1321
00:57:32,068 --> 00:57:35,254
"Oh, my god. Yeah, it's deep!"

1322
00:57:35,379 --> 00:57:37,828
You know when you got
a hamburger and the cat go,

1323
00:57:37,848 --> 00:57:40,668
"raaar..."

1324
00:57:40,793 --> 00:57:44,737
When you got meat
and the cat go, "raaar,"

1325
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:47,806
"you want some of this?"
"Raaar!"

1326
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:51,564
Drop it and run!

1327
00:57:51,689 --> 00:57:54,150
Some stuff
you not supposed to have.

1328
00:57:54,275 --> 00:57:57,668
Like little dogs that fit
in your purse and your pocket.

1329
00:57:57,793 --> 00:58:00,116
That's not a dog.

1330
00:58:00,241 --> 00:58:01,823
We got one. We got a chihuahua.

1331
00:58:01,843 --> 00:58:04,166
My wife found a chihuahua.
We saved it.

1332
00:58:04,241 --> 00:58:07,219
From a parking lot.

1333
00:58:07,344 --> 00:58:09,334
Whenever you see a dog
in a parking lot,

1334
00:58:09,459 --> 00:58:10,991
somebody put that dog there
for a reason.

1335
00:58:11,011 --> 00:58:12,323
There's a reason.

1336
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:14,221
When you go to the dog pound...
I mean, that sounds good

1337
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,027
to save a animal
from a dog pound...

1338
00:58:16,152 --> 00:58:18,199
There's a reason people
let them dogs go.

1339
00:58:18,324 --> 00:58:19,668
'Cause they're crazy.

1340
00:58:19,793 --> 00:58:21,254
There's a reason.

1341
00:58:21,379 --> 00:58:23,048
There's a reason
you let them dogs go.

1342
00:58:23,068 --> 00:58:25,117
And they fake it, 'cause
they know they about to die,

1343
00:58:25,137 --> 00:58:26,531
so when you go to the dog
pound they're like this...

1344
00:58:26,551 --> 00:58:28,392
"Hey, what's... hey! Hey, hey!

1345
00:58:28,517 --> 00:58:30,081
Halloo! Hey!"

1346
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:31,633
Then we get 'em home.

1347
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,875
"Oh, dude, you know
I'm jacked up!

1348
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,081
Dude, I got issues!"

1349
00:58:37,206 --> 00:58:39,599
I got this dog.
We don't know what it is.

1350
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,102
It's mixed with everything.

1351
00:58:41,122 --> 00:58:43,047
It's a chow-German Shepherd-
ch-puppy.

1352
00:58:43,172 --> 00:58:45,081
I don't know what it is.

1353
00:58:45,206 --> 00:58:47,809
I've had it for eight years.
It still don't know me.

1354
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:49,288
It still doesn't know me.

1355
00:58:49,413 --> 00:58:51,199
I come home...
"Err... oh, it's you!

1356
00:58:51,324 --> 00:58:53,061
"My bad! Ooh! Err! Oh, it's you!

1357
00:58:53,186 --> 00:58:55,254
"My bad! Err!

1358
00:58:55,379 --> 00:58:58,840
That's a new shirt, that's a new
shirt, that's a new shirt!"

1359
00:59:03,482 --> 00:59:04,875
I try to take him back.

1360
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,357
Know what they told me?

1361
00:59:06,482 --> 00:59:08,115
"There's a animal psychologist."

1362
00:59:08,137 --> 00:59:09,872
Oh, no. If I ain't seen
the shrink,

1363
00:59:09,892 --> 00:59:11,875
the dog ain't gonna see one.

1364
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,185
The dog can't go first.

1365
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:15,943
Somebody else in the house
gotta go first.

1366
00:59:16,068 --> 00:59:17,426
Not the dog.

1367
00:59:17,551 --> 00:59:19,031
I can't pay that kinda money.

1368
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:22,426
"How's he feelin'?"
"He's very angry.

1369
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:24,599
At you. He's very angry at you."

1370
00:59:24,724 --> 00:59:27,071
"Well, then tell him I'm gonna
take him outside

1371
00:59:27,091 --> 00:59:28,633
and leave him outside."

1372
00:59:28,758 --> 00:59:30,646
And dogs that been put
out of the car,

1373
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:32,564
they don't fall for that twice.

1374
00:59:32,689 --> 00:59:34,475
You try taking a dog
to the woods...

1375
00:59:34,495 --> 00:59:36,323
"Oh, hell, no.

1376
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:39,909
You can get out.
I ain't gettin' out the car."

1377
00:59:41,862 --> 00:59:44,081
Man, we live
in this country now,

1378
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:46,048
everybody going through
all this immigration issue,

1379
00:59:46,068 --> 00:59:47,428
talking about
sending people away.

1380
00:59:47,448 --> 00:59:49,566
How you gonna leave you been
living here 20 years?

1381
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,461
I'm looking at stuff, man,

1382
00:59:50,586 --> 00:59:52,048
people talking about
immigration.

1383
00:59:52,068 --> 00:59:53,393
All these people
from other countries.

1384
00:59:53,413 --> 00:59:54,773
Everybody from another country.

1385
00:59:54,793 --> 00:59:56,528
Did you forget
where you came from?

1386
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,221
We gonna get rid of
all the immigrants.

1387
00:59:58,241 --> 01:00:01,099
There'll be four Indians left.
That's all you gonna have.

1388
01:00:01,137 --> 01:00:03,127
If you gonna do immigration,
then do it.

1389
01:00:03,147 --> 01:00:04,219
Get everybody out.

1390
01:00:04,344 --> 01:00:05,943
Let's start all over again!

1391
01:00:06,068 --> 01:00:07,956
I ain't goin' nowhere.
I don't know...

1392
01:00:07,976 --> 01:00:11,012
If I go to Africa,
look at me in Africa!

1393
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,116
"What tribe you from?"
"High yellow!"

1394
01:00:17,586 --> 01:00:21,426
Me and you,
we'll be our own tribe.

1395
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:25,702
You got green eyes.
You can't be in the tribe.

1396
01:00:28,586 --> 01:00:31,012
And it's... see,
Americans are just mad

1397
01:00:31,137 --> 01:00:33,280
because we can't speak
any other languages.

1398
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:34,911
We supposed to be
an intelligent country.

1399
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:36,461
We can't speak to nobody.

1400
01:00:36,586 --> 01:00:37,876
We just mad that people
come here

1401
01:00:37,896 --> 01:00:39,048
and can speak other languages.

1402
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,255
You go to a third-world country,

1403
01:00:40,275 --> 01:00:42,117
them kids speak
two or three languages.

1404
01:00:42,137 --> 01:00:43,668
Americans can't speak nothing.

1405
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:45,204
We go to other countries mad.

1406
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:47,909
"Can somebody speak English?

1407
01:00:48,034 --> 01:00:51,909
These are some stupid people!"

1408
01:00:52,034 --> 01:00:53,157
No, man. You the fool.

1409
01:00:53,177 --> 01:00:54,811
You in Europe.

1410
01:00:54,896 --> 01:00:59,219
"Hello? Hello? Hello?

1411
01:00:59,344 --> 01:01:01,702
Where's the McDonald's?
McDonald's?"

1412
01:01:05,586 --> 01:01:08,699
You got to be careful you go to
McDonald's in other countries.

1413
01:01:08,824 --> 01:01:10,049
They don't have no cows.

1414
01:01:10,169 --> 01:01:14,323
They got kangaroos and roosters.

1415
01:01:14,448 --> 01:01:15,877
I don't see no possums here.

1416
01:01:15,897 --> 01:01:17,771
"Oh, yes, you did.

1417
01:01:17,896 --> 01:01:20,254
That ten-piece mcnugget
you just had."

1418
01:01:23,034 --> 01:01:24,599
Oh, man. It's crazy.

1419
01:01:24,724 --> 01:01:26,765
And then this is
what American people do.

1420
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,727
When we can't speak
another language,

1421
01:01:28,747 --> 01:01:30,771
we speak a dumber
version of English.

1422
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:33,048
Where my Spanish people at?
I love my Spanish people.

1423
01:01:33,068 --> 01:01:35,221
Don't you love when somebody try
and speak Spanish to you?

1424
01:01:35,241 --> 01:01:36,807
"Uh, you, uh... you,
uh, help, uh, me?

1425
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:39,838
"You, uh... you can... you, uh...
Can you, uh, understand...

1426
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:42,055
"Can you, uh... can you,
uh, help, uh, me?

1427
01:01:42,075 --> 01:01:43,219
Can you, uh..."

1428
01:01:43,344 --> 01:01:45,943
Oh, that's much better.

1429
01:01:46,068 --> 01:01:49,943
Now I'm right down with you.

1430
01:01:50,068 --> 01:01:51,807
You better learn
to speak another language.

1431
01:01:51,827 --> 01:01:53,185
You better learn Spanish.

1432
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,255
You better learn Spanish,
you gonna live in this country.

1433
01:01:55,275 --> 01:01:57,469
Don't fight it no more.
You better learn it.

1434
01:01:57,586 --> 01:02:00,357
The day is coming.
You be standing in line.

1435
01:02:00,482 --> 01:02:03,116
"Can somebody help me please?"

1436
01:02:03,241 --> 01:02:04,669
Tell you, man,
we should be able to.

1437
01:02:04,689 --> 01:02:06,669
Man, our kids should be learning
all kinds of stuff.

1438
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:08,730
This a metropolitan area, man.
I'm sorry.

1439
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,842
I know it started off
and you were slaves.

1440
01:02:10,906 --> 01:02:13,406
I'm sorry we got freed,
but you should have fought

1441
01:02:13,426 --> 01:02:15,737
a little harder during the war.

1442
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:17,668
We got loose. My bad.

1443
01:02:17,793 --> 01:02:19,288
We got loose.

1444
01:02:21,939 --> 01:02:23,980
Some of y'all lost jobs.
Some of y'all...

1445
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,014
See, older people...
See, the American way...

1446
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:27,359
Young people,
y'all don't understand.

1447
01:02:27,379 --> 01:02:28,635
What you went to school for
ain't got nothing

1448
01:02:28,655 --> 01:02:29,806
to do with nothing.

1449
01:02:29,931 --> 01:02:31,255
Forget what
your scholarship was.

1450
01:02:31,275 --> 01:02:32,359
Forget what your degree was in.

1451
01:02:32,379 --> 01:02:34,063
You better learn
the American way.

1452
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,771
Lie on a resume. You lie.

1453
01:02:35,896 --> 01:02:37,392
And you learn on the job.

1454
01:02:37,517 --> 01:02:40,943
You learn when you get there.

1455
01:02:41,068 --> 01:02:42,288
"Can you weld?" "Weld?

1456
01:02:42,413 --> 01:02:43,943
Yeah!"

1457
01:02:47,862 --> 01:02:49,750
That's how I got
my first welding job.

1458
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:51,875
My daddy taught me how to weld.

1459
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,939
I didn't realize
you can't wear shorts.

1460
01:02:56,275 --> 01:02:58,495
My first day there,
"whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

1461
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:00,185
Whoo! Whoa!"

1462
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:02,402
And that old man looked
at me and laughed.

1463
01:03:03,206 --> 01:03:04,278
"Boy, you can't weld.

1464
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:06,300
You should have
said something earlier."

1465
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,806
But I got that job.

1466
01:03:07,931 --> 01:03:09,943
I'll get a job.
I will get a job.

1467
01:03:10,068 --> 01:03:11,840
I will find myself a job.

1468
01:03:11,965 --> 01:03:13,394
And I ain't gon' even apply.

1469
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:15,407
I'm just gon' get
a badge and show up.

1470
01:03:15,427 --> 01:03:16,771
"Can I help you?"

1471
01:03:16,896 --> 01:03:18,631
"What are you doing?"
"I got a job.

1472
01:03:18,651 --> 01:03:20,185
"I work here now.

1473
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,116
"Sir, I work here now!

1474
01:03:22,241 --> 01:03:25,737
You got to let somebody go.
This my job."

1475
01:03:25,862 --> 01:03:27,903
You got to make people
think you so crazy

1476
01:03:27,931 --> 01:03:29,116
they won't fire you.

1477
01:03:29,241 --> 01:03:30,874
That's how you get job security.

1478
01:03:30,894 --> 01:03:32,374
Not by being a good employee.

1479
01:03:32,448 --> 01:03:35,051
You got to be the employee
they think will come back

1480
01:03:35,071 --> 01:03:37,633
at night with a mask
and kill everybody

1481
01:03:37,758 --> 01:03:39,392
in the parking lot.

1482
01:03:39,517 --> 01:03:42,426
That's how you
keep a job in america.

1483
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:44,541
Every once in a while,
just walk around.

1484
01:03:44,561 --> 01:03:46,653
"Man, if they let me go,
I think I'll kill

1485
01:03:46,673 --> 01:03:48,668
everybody up in here!"

1486
01:03:48,793 --> 01:03:49,911
"Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1487
01:03:49,931 --> 01:03:51,600
"Sinbad,
no one's getting laid off.

1488
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,865
Sinbad... Sinbad,
no one's getting laid off."

1489
01:03:53,885 --> 01:03:55,254
"That's what I'm saying."

1490
01:03:58,068 --> 01:03:59,140
The plant will close.

1491
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,564
I'll be still working.

1492
01:04:05,862 --> 01:04:07,903
Man, remember before that...
I look at...

1493
01:04:07,965 --> 01:04:09,751
I ain't gon' lie.
I like technology.

1494
01:04:09,771 --> 01:04:12,185
I like my texting,
but there is a limit.

1495
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:14,147
Young people text
each other standing

1496
01:04:14,272 --> 01:04:15,548
right next to each other.

1497
01:04:17,827 --> 01:04:19,943
Speak!

1498
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:21,943
Speak!

1499
01:04:22,068 --> 01:04:23,564
"Did you get my text?"

1500
01:04:31,689 --> 01:04:33,530
God, man.

1501
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,152
I want to help my young people.

1502
01:04:35,172 --> 01:04:37,264
Any teenagers... no
teenagers here, right?

1503
01:04:37,284 --> 01:04:38,699
Teenagers? Teenagers here?

1504
01:04:38,724 --> 01:04:40,357
- Hold old are you, man?
- 17.

1505
01:04:40,482 --> 01:04:43,034
Okay, 'cause I know you're
with your family, right?

1506
01:04:43,054 --> 01:04:44,483
'Cause you don't have a car.

1507
01:04:44,571 --> 01:04:45,599
I can tell.

1508
01:04:45,724 --> 01:04:48,392
I can see it in your eyes.
You got that look.

1509
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:50,564
I know it sucks. It sucks, man.

1510
01:04:50,689 --> 01:04:52,357
You 17. You don't have no car.

1511
01:04:52,482 --> 01:04:54,669
You got a car, but you didn't
drive it here though, did you?

1512
01:04:54,689 --> 01:04:57,150
'Cause the valet parking here
would have saw you.

1513
01:04:57,275 --> 01:04:58,530
"Who's car is this?"

1514
01:04:58,655 --> 01:05:00,288
"It ain't mine."

1515
01:05:00,413 --> 01:05:02,564
'Cause L.A. put pressure
on you, man.

1516
01:05:02,689 --> 01:05:03,806
I didn't know.

1517
01:05:03,931 --> 01:05:05,669
I had a little hoopty
when I first got here.

1518
01:05:05,689 --> 01:05:07,600
All these Mercedes
was pulling up and bmws.

1519
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:09,048
The man brought mine up. I said,

1520
01:05:09,068 --> 01:05:11,058
"take it over there.
Take it over there.

1521
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:13,068
"Take it over there.
Take it over there!

1522
01:05:15,586 --> 01:05:19,668
I can't get in this car in front
of all of these people."

1523
01:05:19,778 --> 01:05:21,462
Now, at 53, see,
that's different.

1524
01:05:21,482 --> 01:05:22,911
You 17. At 53, I don't care.

1525
01:05:22,965 --> 01:05:24,598
They could bring up
a skateboard.

1526
01:05:24,618 --> 01:05:26,702
"Catch y'all later."

1527
01:05:26,827 --> 01:05:29,276
See, at 53, you ain't trying
to make new friends.

1528
01:05:29,296 --> 01:05:31,495
I'm trying to get rid of people.

1529
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,763
The older you get,
the less people you need

1530
01:05:33,783 --> 01:05:34,978
in your life.

1531
01:05:35,103 --> 01:05:37,048
You don't need...
Ain't nobody got 100 friends.

1532
01:05:37,068 --> 01:05:38,288
MySpace and Facebook.

1533
01:05:38,413 --> 01:05:39,943
Nobody got 100 friends.

1534
01:05:40,068 --> 01:05:41,392
Two!

1535
01:05:41,517 --> 01:05:43,083
You just need two people
to check on you

1536
01:05:43,103 --> 01:05:44,531
if they ain't seen you
to see if you had a stroke.

1537
01:05:44,551 --> 01:05:47,256
They come to your house.
They look through the window.

1538
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,461
That's all you need
is two people

1539
01:05:49,586 --> 01:05:51,426
to call 911.

1540
01:05:51,551 --> 01:05:53,909
That's all you need.

1541
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:55,807
See, when you young
and somebody show up

1542
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:56,911
at your house unexpected,
"man, what's up?

1543
01:05:56,931 --> 01:05:58,207
Oh, man, what you doing?"

1544
01:05:58,227 --> 01:06:00,943
When you 50 years old and
doorbell rings at 6:00...

1545
01:06:01,068 --> 01:06:03,943
"Who the hell?

1546
01:06:04,068 --> 01:06:06,116
"It's 6:30.

1547
01:06:06,241 --> 01:06:08,639
"Who the hell comes
to somebody's house at 6:30?

1548
01:06:10,344 --> 01:06:12,012
What?"

1549
01:06:12,137 --> 01:06:13,186
"Well, we were
in the neighborhood."

1550
01:06:13,206 --> 01:06:15,219
"Well, drive around
and look at it.

1551
01:06:15,344 --> 01:06:17,185
We're about to go to sleep."

1552
01:06:20,413 --> 01:06:22,254
Man.

1553
01:06:22,379 --> 01:06:24,047
Dude, I was just 17 last week.

1554
01:06:24,172 --> 01:06:25,771
It goes fast, man.

1555
01:06:25,896 --> 01:06:28,288
Dude, it goes fast.

1556
01:06:28,413 --> 01:06:29,893
I'm serious, man. Enjoy this.

1557
01:06:29,967 --> 01:06:32,186
It goes quick.
Dude, I could out-hang you.

1558
01:06:32,311 --> 01:06:34,047
I could hang!

1559
01:06:34,172 --> 01:06:36,826
Now I can't sleep 'cause
I got to go to the bathroom,

1560
01:06:36,846 --> 01:06:38,909
but that's different.

1561
01:06:39,034 --> 01:06:40,564
I got to stay up for reasons.

1562
01:06:40,689 --> 01:06:42,875
For personal reasons.

1563
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,945
I don't know when
I started getting tired.

1564
01:06:44,965 --> 01:06:46,773
Everybody here...
Anybody here over 35, 40?

1565
01:06:46,793 --> 01:06:49,014
Remember you sit there,
it's, like, 9:00 at night,

1566
01:06:49,034 --> 01:06:50,361
and you look at your wife.

1567
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,426
"Oh, it's 9:30.

1568
01:06:51,551 --> 01:06:53,737
Where did the day go?
It's 9:30."

1569
01:06:53,862 --> 01:06:55,546
And you talk about
that for hours.

1570
01:06:55,566 --> 01:06:56,909
"It's 9:30.

1571
01:06:57,034 --> 01:07:00,599
We better go to bed
and get out these clothes."

1572
01:07:00,724 --> 01:07:03,480
See, when you're young,
you just jump out your clothes.

1573
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,392
You gotta... it takes time.

1574
01:07:05,517 --> 01:07:07,201
"Could you get
that button for me?

1575
01:07:07,326 --> 01:07:08,959
My hand. My hand's locked up."

1576
01:07:10,724 --> 01:07:12,816
You help each other undress.
"Get my shoe.

1577
01:07:12,836 --> 01:07:14,323
"Can you get my shoe?

1578
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:16,081
"It swole up.
I can't get it off.

1579
01:07:16,103 --> 01:07:17,787
I told you to get it
off earlier."

1580
01:07:21,191 --> 01:07:22,773
You can't go to dinner at 7:00.

1581
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:25,083
You can't... that's crazy,
trying to go to dinner at 7:00.

1582
01:07:25,103 --> 01:07:27,603
"Ooh, it's gonna be 9:00
by the time we get back."

1583
01:07:27,728 --> 01:07:29,463
You already tired
before you leave.

1584
01:07:29,483 --> 01:07:30,912
"Oh, god. It's already 7:00.

1585
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,081
By the time we get there,
it'd be 7:00, 7:30, 7:45."

1586
01:07:34,206 --> 01:07:39,392
You done wore yourself trying
to get to the car.

1587
01:07:39,517 --> 01:07:41,152
How many times have you
dressed up to go out

1588
01:07:41,172 --> 01:07:42,652
and you mess up and sit down?

1589
01:07:42,672 --> 01:07:44,443
"You still want to go?

1590
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,599
I done sat down now.
I don't need to go."

1591
01:07:53,724 --> 01:07:56,429
You the two best-dressed people
looking at the closer.

1592
01:07:58,068 --> 01:08:00,323
"I'm glad we didn't go."
"I'm glad too."

1593
01:08:00,448 --> 01:08:01,928
"I thought you wanted to go."

1594
01:08:01,948 --> 01:08:03,081
"I never want to go."

1595
01:08:09,068 --> 01:08:10,392
Man.

1596
01:08:17,724 --> 01:08:19,426
Oh, man.

1597
01:08:19,551 --> 01:08:21,184
You're 17. You got a girlfriend?

1598
01:08:21,206 --> 01:08:22,393
You ain't ready.
You ain't ready.

1599
01:08:22,413 --> 01:08:23,428
You 17, you ain't ready.

1600
01:08:23,448 --> 01:08:24,669
You ain't ready to have a woman.

1601
01:08:24,689 --> 01:08:26,462
You ain't nowhere near ready
to have a woman.

1602
01:08:26,482 --> 01:08:27,599
You ain't ready.

1603
01:08:27,724 --> 01:08:30,219
You ain't ready
for another 20, 30 years.

1604
01:08:30,344 --> 01:08:31,771
You in training right now.

1605
01:08:31,896 --> 01:08:33,478
You don't know nothing. You 17.

1606
01:08:33,498 --> 01:08:34,994
You don't know Jack.

1607
01:08:35,068 --> 01:08:36,255
I know you think... you look
at your parents.

1608
01:08:36,275 --> 01:08:38,530
"I'm 17, mom! I'm 17!"

1609
01:08:38,655 --> 01:08:41,771
And we laugh at you...
'Cause you can't do nothing.

1610
01:08:41,896 --> 01:08:43,012
Think about it. 17.

1611
01:08:43,137 --> 01:08:44,012
You been driving for a year.

1612
01:08:44,137 --> 01:08:45,158
You still hit stuff.

1613
01:08:47,241 --> 01:08:49,047
You know,
you make dumb decisions.

1614
01:08:49,172 --> 01:08:52,702
"We were racing.
We were racing on the curve."

1615
01:08:52,827 --> 01:08:54,817
"Why were you doing it?"
"I don't know."

1616
01:08:56,931 --> 01:08:59,185
And you want to know
why we think you crazy?

1617
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:00,669
'Cause you got
too much testosterone.

1618
01:09:00,689 --> 01:09:02,117
That's what's wrong with you.

1619
01:09:02,137 --> 01:09:04,152
You like everything.
That's why you can't date yet.

1620
01:09:04,172 --> 01:09:06,060
At 17, you're like,
"oh, look at that!

1621
01:09:06,185 --> 01:09:08,022
"Ooh! Look at that!
Oh, look at that!

1622
01:09:08,042 --> 01:09:10,668
Ooh."

1623
01:09:10,793 --> 01:09:12,357
17, you like everything.

1624
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:14,829
"Your grandmamma cute.
Your grandma look good."

1625
01:09:14,849 --> 01:09:17,081
At 17, if a grandma
got some legs,

1626
01:09:17,206 --> 01:09:18,495
you getting that number.

1627
01:09:22,517 --> 01:09:24,461
I don't know, man.

1628
01:09:24,498 --> 01:09:25,876
It's just that... I mean...

1629
01:09:25,896 --> 01:09:27,393
Look, I think we make life
harder than what it is.

1630
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,531
I think we life our hard.
We make our jobs hard.

1631
01:09:29,551 --> 01:09:31,745
We make life hard.
It don't have to be hard.

1632
01:09:31,765 --> 01:09:33,296
It don't have to be this hard.

1633
01:09:33,386 --> 01:09:35,633
It don't have to be hard.
It doesn't.

1634
01:09:35,758 --> 01:09:38,105
At your job, you ain't got
to lose your temper.

1635
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:39,461
They ain't gon' fire you.

1636
01:09:39,586 --> 01:09:41,495
There's nobody trained.

1637
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,564
There's nobody
that can do your job.

1638
01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:45,322
The customer
is not always right.

1639
01:09:45,413 --> 01:09:48,012
Sometimes he's stupid.
You got to shut him down.

1640
01:09:48,137 --> 01:09:50,633
Shut him down.

1641
01:09:50,758 --> 01:09:52,219
I hate dumb customers.

1642
01:09:52,344 --> 01:09:53,824
"Excuse me, can you help me?"

1643
01:09:53,862 --> 01:09:55,288
"No.

1644
01:09:55,413 --> 01:09:56,668
"It's a quarter to 5:00.

1645
01:09:56,793 --> 01:09:58,599
I've been done for 20 minutes."

1646
01:10:01,068 --> 01:10:02,978
I hate... I hated working
retail.

1647
01:10:03,103 --> 01:10:04,669
I hate... I got fired
from every job I had.

1648
01:10:04,689 --> 01:10:06,564
This the only job I ever kept.

1649
01:10:06,689 --> 01:10:07,978
I'm not good with people.

1650
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:09,430
I'm not good 9:00 to 5:00.

1651
01:10:09,482 --> 01:10:10,842
It's not... I can't...
There's so much pressure

1652
01:10:10,862 --> 01:10:13,516
to be there all day and people
keep coming up to you.

1653
01:10:13,551 --> 01:10:15,643
"Can you help me?"
"No, I can't help you."

1654
01:10:15,758 --> 01:10:17,150
"Do you have this in blue?"

1655
01:10:17,275 --> 01:10:20,357
"Well, let me look. No."

1656
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:21,945
"Well, do you have
it in the back?"

1657
01:10:21,965 --> 01:10:24,150
"Well, if I go in the back,
I'm on break...

1658
01:10:24,275 --> 01:10:26,047
And you'll never know anyway."

1659
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:33,945
Who's got a job that
got to deal with folks?

1660
01:10:33,965 --> 01:10:35,014
Who got to deal with people?

1661
01:10:35,034 --> 01:10:36,152
Got a job got to deal
with people?

1662
01:10:36,172 --> 01:10:37,876
Go to deal with people?
What you do?

1663
01:10:37,896 --> 01:10:39,048
You're a firefighter? Oh, god.

1664
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,186
Y'all had... you know what?

1665
01:10:40,206 --> 01:10:41,497
Y'all had some
fires y'all fought.

1666
01:10:41,517 --> 01:10:43,609
Y'all... god bless y'all.
God bless y'all.

1667
01:10:43,629 --> 01:10:45,495
I don't know how.
I don't know how.

1668
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,069
I don't know how you do it.

1669
01:10:48,089 --> 01:10:48,978
I do not know.

1670
01:10:49,103 --> 01:10:50,497
I was gon' play a fireman
in a movie,

1671
01:10:50,517 --> 01:10:51,600
so they let me ride
on the truck with 'em.

1672
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:53,151
I was burning up a block away.

1673
01:10:53,275 --> 01:10:55,081
Y'all were... my eyebrows
came off.

1674
01:10:55,206 --> 01:10:56,461
I was a block away.

1675
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,669
I said, "y'all got to let me
get off this truck."

1676
01:10:58,689 --> 01:11:00,526
Y'all like this,
"we ain't close yet.

1677
01:11:00,546 --> 01:11:01,909
We're not into the heat."

1678
01:11:02,034 --> 01:11:03,769
I was melting.
My skin was melting.

1679
01:11:05,551 --> 01:11:07,288
I don't know how y'all do it.

1680
01:11:07,413 --> 01:11:09,352
See, I'm not that dedicated.
I know me.

1681
01:11:09,413 --> 01:11:12,323
I'm not a hero,
I'm not built that way.

1682
01:11:12,448 --> 01:11:14,744
If your cat's in the house...
My cat's inside.

1683
01:11:14,764 --> 01:11:15,764
Well, not long.

1684
01:11:19,862 --> 01:11:22,564
Oh, there he goes now.

1685
01:11:22,689 --> 01:11:24,943
I ain't going in to get the cat.

1686
01:11:25,068 --> 01:11:28,357
He should've got out.

1687
01:11:28,482 --> 01:11:30,068
The dog made it.

1688
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:37,600
And people are always talking
about the animal was a hero.

1689
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,794
A dog saved the family.

1690
01:11:38,896 --> 01:11:40,738
That dog tried to get
out and the door was shut.

1691
01:11:40,758 --> 01:11:42,952
That's when it went back
and got the family.

1692
01:11:42,972 --> 01:11:45,013
That dog went to the door...
Oh, shoot...

1693
01:11:45,344 --> 01:11:47,116
Thank you. Just open the door!

1694
01:11:48,413 --> 01:11:51,426
Sparky saved us,
sparky saved us.

1695
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,929
If you left that door open,

1696
01:11:52,949 --> 01:11:55,254
y'all wouldn't have
woke up on this one.

1697
01:11:55,379 --> 01:11:57,828
I'd have just moved
next door with the neighbors,

1698
01:11:57,848 --> 01:11:58,909
I liked them.

1699
01:11:59,034 --> 01:12:00,495
Man...

1700
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:03,668
What'd you say, man?

1701
01:12:03,758 --> 01:12:05,187
- Love you!
- Thank you, man.

1702
01:12:05,207 --> 01:12:06,426
Thank you, brother.

1703
01:12:06,551 --> 01:12:07,674
Love you all too, man.

1704
01:12:11,965 --> 01:12:13,531
I'm not one of
those adventure-seekers,

1705
01:12:13,551 --> 01:12:15,600
I ain't no thrill-seeker... see
that's what happens, see...

1706
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:17,014
Black people start making money

1707
01:12:17,034 --> 01:12:18,911
and we wanna do stuff
we didn't never do.

1708
01:12:18,931 --> 01:12:20,600
Wanna climb mountains...
It's right there,

1709
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:23,012
you ain't gonna climb it,
you got a house.

1710
01:12:23,137 --> 01:12:24,807
Why you gotta go outside
and climb a rock?

1711
01:12:24,827 --> 01:12:27,081
It ain't make no sense.
'Cause it's there.

1712
01:12:27,206 --> 01:12:29,943
See, when black people
die falling off mountains,

1713
01:12:30,068 --> 01:12:32,875
black people go like this,
"what the hell was he doing?

1714
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,771
He was on a mountain?"

1715
01:12:34,896 --> 01:12:36,185
"What was up there?

1716
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:39,576
"Nothing, he climbed up there...
Had a rope and climbed up there.

1717
01:12:39,596 --> 01:12:42,219
"For what?

1718
01:12:42,344 --> 01:12:43,737
You know he bipolar."

1719
01:12:49,206 --> 01:12:51,094
We go to funerals
just to look at you.

1720
01:12:51,114 --> 01:12:52,978
"Look at him, he was so stupid.

1721
01:12:53,103 --> 01:12:56,702
On a mountain?
He was on a mountain?"

1722
01:12:56,827 --> 01:12:58,307
I had these dudes convince me

1723
01:12:58,327 --> 01:13:01,943
to bungee jump
off a hot air balloon.

1724
01:13:02,068 --> 01:13:04,875
I'm in a hot air balloon,
and the moment he jumped over,

1725
01:13:04,895 --> 01:13:06,426
whoo...

1726
01:13:06,551 --> 01:13:07,771
Whoo!

1727
01:13:07,896 --> 01:13:10,192
Then I just thought,
"I'm in a hot air balloon

1728
01:13:10,212 --> 01:13:11,978
"forget the bungee jumping.

1729
01:13:12,103 --> 01:13:14,426
Why am I in a hot air balloon?"

1730
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:15,929
All they have is some fire.

1731
01:13:18,724 --> 01:13:20,102
I have a cigarette lighter,

1732
01:13:20,122 --> 01:13:21,822
"we ain't
gonna let this go down."

1733
01:13:24,965 --> 01:13:26,012
"Sinbad, you jump."

1734
01:13:26,137 --> 01:13:28,034
"No, you aren't
gonna take me down."

1735
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,047
You not supposed
to do everything.

1736
01:13:33,172 --> 01:13:34,958
My daughter
convinced us to jump out

1737
01:13:34,978 --> 01:13:36,702
an airplane for her birthday.

1738
01:13:36,827 --> 01:13:38,911
My daughter said,
"I wanna jump out an airplane."

1739
01:13:38,931 --> 01:13:40,152
And I had just read about a girl

1740
01:13:40,172 --> 01:13:41,945
who jumped out
the airplane the week before.

1741
01:13:41,965 --> 01:13:44,152
And her parachute didn't open...
And she lived.

1742
01:13:44,172 --> 01:13:46,704
See, that's what happens when
you don't learn nothing.

1743
01:13:46,724 --> 01:13:48,255
She lived. She hit the ground.

1744
01:13:48,275 --> 01:13:49,669
You remember,
you read about that?

1745
01:13:49,689 --> 01:13:51,628
She hit the ground,
ph, and she got up.

1746
01:13:51,648 --> 01:13:52,648
"Oh, god."

1747
01:13:54,655 --> 01:13:56,840
And went back again
the next day.

1748
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:59,668
That was god saying,
"why the hell I let you live?

1749
01:14:01,448 --> 01:14:05,978
I kept the chute closed so
you wouldn't do this no more."

1750
01:14:06,103 --> 01:14:08,943
And I'm trying to be cool,
like I wasn't scared.

1751
01:14:10,137 --> 01:14:13,551
Your face is like...

1752
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:19,249
And it's a tandem jump, so this
dude is right on the back of me,

1753
01:14:19,269 --> 01:14:20,489
I'm like...

1754
01:14:21,448 --> 01:14:24,098
And I'm like, this is
what's kind of freaky already.

1755
01:14:33,655 --> 01:14:35,564
Stupid stuff.

1756
01:14:35,689 --> 01:14:37,771
Where my skydiver?
We got skydivers here?

1757
01:14:37,896 --> 01:14:39,392
Skydive?

1758
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:40,909
Y'all skydive? Why?

1759
01:14:41,034 --> 01:14:42,288
Tell me why you skydive.

1760
01:14:42,413 --> 01:14:43,978
- Why not?
- Why not...

1761
01:14:44,103 --> 01:14:45,255
Well, why don't you
just burn yourself?

1762
01:14:45,275 --> 01:14:47,150
See what that feel like?

1763
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:50,323
There's a fireman, she'll
take you on the next ride.

1764
01:14:50,448 --> 01:14:52,744
Run through the house,
see if you can get out.

1765
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:59,599
See, if you say why not,
that applies to everything.

1766
01:14:59,724 --> 01:15:03,599
What if I jump off a mountain
with just a towel?

1767
01:15:03,724 --> 01:15:05,185
And see if I make it.

1768
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:06,357
Why not?

1769
01:15:06,482 --> 01:15:08,288
Phh. That's why not.

1770
01:15:08,413 --> 01:15:10,219
'Cause your towel didn't work.

1771
01:15:12,896 --> 01:15:14,635
Man, you know what I wanna do?
I wanna do something for y'all.

1772
01:15:14,655 --> 01:15:16,359
I wanna do something for y'all
tonight, 'cause you know what?

1773
01:15:16,379 --> 01:15:18,186
We got young people here,
you know, I feel sorry for you.

1774
01:15:18,206 --> 01:15:19,600
I feel sorry
that y'all not gonna

1775
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:21,048
have no music when y'all 50.

1776
01:15:21,068 --> 01:15:23,221
So I wanna do something...
I know... I know...

1777
01:15:23,241 --> 01:15:25,895
See, I'm 53, I still
go to the playboy jazz festival.

1778
01:15:25,915 --> 01:15:28,211
We still got groups.
I mean, they getting old.

1779
01:15:28,231 --> 01:15:29,444
But they still sing.

1780
01:15:29,482 --> 01:15:32,391
I mean, they can't move like
they used to, they be like...

1781
01:15:44,448 --> 01:15:46,897
But I look at young
people... y'all who are 17...

1782
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,990
Who're you gonna look at
when you're 50?

1783
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:50,909
Who will you go see?

1784
01:15:51,034 --> 01:15:52,668
Britney Spears?

1785
01:15:52,793 --> 01:15:55,978
The Jonas brothers...
I hate... I hate...

1786
01:15:58,896 --> 01:16:00,840
That ain't right.

1787
01:16:00,965 --> 01:16:02,668
They're god's children.

1788
01:16:02,793 --> 01:16:04,896
I hate them so much.
I hate them.

1789
01:16:06,448 --> 01:16:08,359
They moved Stevie wonder's
microphone during the grammies.

1790
01:16:08,379 --> 01:16:09,807
Did y'all watch that?

1791
01:16:09,827 --> 01:16:12,771
The Jonas... Stevie was trying
to sing, they took the mic,

1792
01:16:12,896 --> 01:16:14,978
"sing Stevie", Stevie said...

1793
01:16:16,172 --> 01:16:18,012
"Who took my mic?"

1794
01:16:18,137 --> 01:16:19,911
They was running around Stevie,
running around.

1795
01:16:19,931 --> 01:16:21,564
"Stevie, show 'em what you got."

1796
01:16:21,638 --> 01:16:23,934
He got grammies, fool,
that's what Stevie got.

1797
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:24,954
What you got?

1798
01:16:25,068 --> 01:16:26,943
God.

1799
01:16:27,068 --> 01:16:29,875
So I don't know... know

01:16:35,896 --> 01:16:39,150

01:16:39,275 --> 01:16:40,500
- Metallica.

1804
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:41,846
Yeah, they might.
Yeah, they still might,

1805
01:16:41,866 --> 01:16:43,909
'cause they won't die,
they just...

1806
01:16:44,034 --> 01:16:46,600
Metallica... see, metallica's

1807
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:47,807
- Yeah.

1808
01:16:47,827 --> 01:16:49,766

1809
01:16:49,786 --> 01:16:52,047

01:16:52,172 --> 01:16:53,550
- Beyonce.
- Beyonce, uh-uh.

1811
01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:56,426
Beyonce, she gonna make
too much money.

1812
01:16:56,551 --> 01:16:58,184
She's not gonna be
singing at 50.

1813
01:16:58,204 --> 01:16:59,530
No.

1814
01:16:59,655 --> 01:17:02,360
See, my thing is, I don't
know who you're gonna watch.

1815
01:17:02,485 --> 01:17:03,863
You're gonna have one. Who?

1816
01:17:03,898 --> 01:17:06,219
Jay-Z? Yeah...

1817
01:17:07,827 --> 01:17:10,072
Ain't no 75-year-old
rappers doing concert...

1818
01:17:10,137 --> 01:17:11,288
When's the last...

1819
01:17:13,068 --> 01:17:15,926
When's the last time you seen
"how you all doin' tonight?

1820
01:17:17,068 --> 01:17:19,722
"Everybody gonna get low?
Y'all ready to get low low?

1821
01:17:19,742 --> 01:17:22,564
Everybody get low low."

1822
01:17:22,689 --> 01:17:25,189
You already gonna be low,
you ain't gotta get low.

1823
01:17:27,172 --> 01:17:29,315
Drop it like it's hot.
It fell on it's own.

1824
01:17:29,335 --> 01:17:30,486
It fell off.

1825
01:17:32,551 --> 01:17:34,530
It fell down, what it did.

1826
01:17:34,655 --> 01:17:37,155
So I wanna do... what
I wanna do for y'all tonight

1827
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,501
is something special
'cause some of y'all

1828
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:40,599
never seen an instrument.

1829
01:17:40,724 --> 01:17:42,428
I know some of y'all
freaking out, "what is that?

1830
01:17:42,448 --> 01:17:44,116
Is that an 808? Is that an 808?"

1831
01:17:44,241 --> 01:17:46,737
No, it's a drum.

1832
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:49,978
So I wanna do... I've been
blessed... this... this...

1833
01:17:50,103 --> 01:17:52,048
This group here...
They's some of the baddest

1834
01:17:52,068 --> 01:17:54,255
musicians and singers... and
I want y'all to get a chance

1835
01:17:54,275 --> 01:17:55,737
once in your lifetime

1836
01:17:55,862 --> 01:17:58,978
so you say, "I saw music
once when I was 17.

1837
01:17:59,103 --> 01:18:00,219
"It was incredible.

1838
01:18:00,344 --> 01:18:02,283
Not American idol-like,
but real-like."

1839
01:18:02,303 --> 01:18:04,943
And I'm gonna
put myself on the line...

1840
01:18:05,068 --> 01:18:07,152
I've only been playing
guitar for four months.

1841
01:18:07,172 --> 01:18:08,805
I figure since can't nobody sing

1842
01:18:08,879 --> 01:18:10,480
and they trying out for
American idol, I'm gonna sing.

1843
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,185
I can't sing and
they can't sing, so we equal.

1844
01:18:14,517 --> 01:18:16,150
Can't nobody play, I can't play.

1845
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:17,224
So I'm gonna play.

1846
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:18,978
I equal everybody now... Huh?

1847
01:18:20,517 --> 01:18:21,842
- Do it for Ben Harper.
- Do it for Ben Harper.

1848
01:18:21,862 --> 01:18:23,221
So I wanna do something special,

1849
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:25,290
I wanna bring some music out
for you, can see real music

1850
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:27,117
so I can bring out... gonna put
on one of the baddest bands

1851
01:18:27,137 --> 01:18:28,719
led by Greg phillinganes. Greg!

1852
01:18:28,739 --> 01:18:30,131
Bring this band out here.

1853
01:18:31,448 --> 01:18:33,591
We gonna... we gonna
try to do something...

1854
01:18:33,611 --> 01:18:34,840
Something to help y'all.

1855
01:18:34,965 --> 01:18:37,461
Just to help y'all.

1856
01:18:37,586 --> 01:18:39,426
We gotta have a hat.
We got a hat?

1857
01:18:39,551 --> 01:18:40,702
Let me have a hat.

1858
01:18:40,827 --> 01:18:42,877
'Cause if you sing,
you gotta have a hat.

1859
01:18:44,206 --> 01:18:45,380
Hat's right here, fool.

1860
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,081
That's right!

1861
01:18:47,206 --> 01:18:48,876
Thank you very much. I like
you to thank... I like you to...

1862
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:50,121
