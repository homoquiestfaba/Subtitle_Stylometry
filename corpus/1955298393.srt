1
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,369
Let's go!

2
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,971
<i> Please take the ticket.</i>

3
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:54,813
Arthur Brennan.

4
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,049
Um, okay.

5
00:01:57,051 --> 00:02:00,486
Where will you be traveling to,
Mr. Brennan?

6
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:01,520
Tokyo.

7
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,557
Um...

8
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,193
When did you book your ticket?

9
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,930
Last night.

10
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,031
Let me help you.

11
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,366
Mmh.

12
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,735
Here it is.

13
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:19,271
Would you like to book
your return flight now?

14
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,040
No.

15
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,208
All right.

16
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,878
I need your bags
up here, please.

17
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,846
I don't have any.

18
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,949
Just the carry on.
Okay, you're all set.

19
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,485
You'll be leaving
out of gate 43.

20
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,221
Boarding begins
in about an hour.

21
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,558
Have a good flight.

22
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:46,532
Hi.

23
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,905
Step back up, please.

24
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,611
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

25
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,947
Welcome aboard Ana.

26
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:38,850
This is a co-shared flight
with our star lines partners.

27
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,890
Sir, are you sure you don't
want anything to eat?

28
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,460
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

29
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,696
Please let us know
if you change your mind.

30
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,179
Hey.

31
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,215
Hey!

32
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,620
Excuse me.

33
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,529
Hey.

34
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,664
You okay?

35
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,276
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,744
Are you okay?

37
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:03,882
Water?

38
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,623
Easy.
Slow, slow, slow.

39
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,825
Are you lost?

40
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,360
Yeah...

41
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,495
I cannot find the way out.

42
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,798
Please.
Please help me.

43
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,801
Okay, look.
Listen to me.

44
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,669
The trail is right there.

45
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:27,105
Okay?
Go that way.

46
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,606
It will lead you out of here.

47
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,942
Straight ahead.

48
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,460
He didn't find the trail.

49
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,841
Are you with anyone?

50
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,778
Are you with anyone?

51
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,979
No.

52
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,235
Thank you.

53
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,671
I have to find it.

54
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,272
Okay, it must be this way.

55
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,446
I walked that direction.

56
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,648
I could not find any trail.

57
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,727
You don't want to leave.

58
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,062
I do.

59
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,199
You came here alone.

60
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,268
Please...

61
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,370
I want to go home
to my family.

62
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,780
This way.

63
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,118
Now listen, do you...

64
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,053
Do you have a cell phone?

65
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,456
It would not work
even if I did.

66
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,126
Did you drive yourself here?

67
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,227
No.

68
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,430
Well, how will you get
to the hospital?

69
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:40,865
I will.

70
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,467
Okay.

71
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,905
This is it.

72
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,442
The trail.
- Trail?

73
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,977
- It's the trail.
- Is it?

74
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:55,346
Yes, yes.
Okay.

75
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,348
Yes, I see.
I see trail.

76
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,816
Follow it that way.

77
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,551
It'll bring you back
to the parking lot. Okay?

78
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,653
Yes. Yes.

79
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:03,988
Go.

80
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,425
Go.
- Thank you. Thank you.

81
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,794
Thank you.
- Okay, go.

82
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,162
Go.

83
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,214
Hey! Hey!

84
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,684
Wait!

85
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,922
Forgot something
in my jacket.

86
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,226
This is not right trail.

87
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,195
I think you'll love it.
The house is amazing.

88
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,966
Exactly.
It's very private.

89
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,102
Okay.
That sounds great.

90
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,371
We can meet tomorrow
at the seller's residence.

91
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,273
Eight o'clock.
Perfect.

92
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,142
Thanks.
Bye.

93
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,812
What happened?

94
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,514
The tank overflowed.

95
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:37,582
Oh...

96
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,450
I have some of those things.

97
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,751
What things?

98
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,588
Those... hand wipes.

99
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,356
- Good.
- Here.

100
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,731
Thank you.

101
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,441
<i> So I have</i>
<i> another showing tomorrow.</i>

102
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,942
That's great, I heard.

103
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,880
It's right by the college.
I could drop by after.

104
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,749
Tomorrow I'm pretty busy.

105
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,151
Well, how 'bout
a quick lunch then?

106
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,653
I could pick up something
on the way over.

107
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:19,757
Yeah, I really don't
have time tomorrow.

108
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,859
Okay. Never mind.

109
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,271
Can you see if my lipstick's
in the glove compartment?

110
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:35,907
Sure.

111
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,942
Mm-hmm...

112
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,917
Mmh... nope.

113
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,152
No, it's not in there.

114
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:49,720
What are you doin'?

115
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,889
Jesus, Joan.
- Did you look good?

116
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,457
Well? Is that it?

117
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,926
Yeah.

118
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,460
I didn't see it.

119
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,129
'Cause you didn't look.

120
00:19:58,131 --> 00:19:59,897
You watched me.

121
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,365
Forget it.

122
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,269
You did the same thing
with the baking powder.

123
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,571
With the baking powder?

124
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:07,972
Forget it.

125
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,674
No, obviously you're
not forgetting it.

126
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,108
What about the baking powder?

127
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,410
It was right there
in the pantry.

128
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,378
Right in front of your face.
- Jesus Christ, Joan.

129
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,014
Are we really gonna fight
about this, huh?

130
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,849
You don't care.

131
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,418
I don't care about what?

132
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,186
Your mind's always
somewhere else.

133
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,588
Okay, well what
groundbreaking thought

134
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,623
kept me from finding
your fucking lipstick?

135
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,058
Go ahead, mock me.

136
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,895
When you're being this
ridiculous, you deserve it.

137
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,630
You're driving home.

138
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,800
Great.

139
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:37,501
What happened?

140
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,905
Well, it turns out
my student-teacher

141
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:46,978
submitted my fantasy football
results instead of my paper.

142
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,815
And here I was thinking
my calculations were wrong.

143
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:53,951
Well, at least that explains
why you got rejected.

144
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,353
That it does.

145
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,022
Are you planning
on resubmitting?

146
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,458
Hmm, who knows?
Maybe.

147
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,294
What about you, Arthur?

148
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,029
- My article?
- Yeah.

149
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:07,498
Um, I think it might
have a chance

150
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,866
in some smaller journals...

151
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:08,866
- Uh-huh.
- ...Actually.

152
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:12,503
Oh, absolutely.
It's a fantastic article.

153
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,639
Thank you.
We'll see. We'll see.

154
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,908
Have you read it, Joan?

155
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,710
- Hmm?
- Have you read it?

156
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,078
No.

157
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,747
She doesn't read my work.

158
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:24,582
Sorry.

159
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,084
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

160
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,420
I don't... appraise your houses.

161
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:30,855
I just...

162
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,990
...think he should be pursuing
other opportunities

163
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,926
instead of waiting around
trying to get published.

164
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,228
Publication in
the right journal

165
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,996
can do wonders
for an adjunct's career.

166
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,298
Mm-hmm.

167
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,899
So can change of profession.

168
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,634
Oh, stop it, Joan.

169
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,236
- Stop what?
- Please.

170
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:49,006
You think it's right your wife
does all the heavy lifting

171
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,875
so you can pretend
to be an intellectual?

172
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:53,010
Is that right, honey?

173
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,812
See, belittling me...

174
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,847
...does wonders
for Joan's self-esteem.

175
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,350
Now, having an audience
compounds that effect,

176
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:01,786
so consider your presence
tonight medicinal.

177
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:04,588
Right, dear? Hmm?
- Cheers. Cheers to that.

178
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,923
Right, Joan?

179
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,680
Well, that's good.
Ruin my work.

180
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,292
We can't keep doing this.

181
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,097
Hey.

182
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,766
How long have you been here?

183
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:30,267
Two days.

184
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,938
Like this?

185
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,211
Give me your tie.

186
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,118
You'll freeze.

187
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
- Come on.
- Take coat.

188
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,155
- I don't want the coat.
- Please, take coat.

189
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:26,624
I don't want the coat.

190
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,626
I want to find the trail.

191
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:29,894
Come on.

192
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,142
Ah.

193
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,768
Grab the root.

194
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,155
Why are you doing this?

195
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:32,222
Huh?

196
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,991
Why do you wanna die?

197
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,195
I do not want to die.

198
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,365
Then why are you here?

199
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,935
It is... I didn't want to live.

200
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,674
What's the difference?

201
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:52,977
My company sent me
to the document...

202
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:54,878
...research department...

203
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
...after I make a mistake.

204
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:59,116
It was a demotion.

205
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,484
A job?

206
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,754
That's why you're doing this?

207
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:07,191
You do not get real work.

208
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:09,159
Nobody speaks to you.

209
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:12,162
You are there,
but you are not.

210
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:13,897
Without job...

211
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,833
...i cannot take care
of my family.

212
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,537
So you come here instead...

213
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,439
You do not understand
my culture.

214
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,607
No.

215
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,043
No, I don't.

216
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,137
What's wrong?

217
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:54,705
Are you okay?

218
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,146
Just dizzy.

219
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,570
Hello?

220
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,605
Is anybody there?!

221
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:31,975
Hello?!

222
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,212
Hello!

223
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,784
There is no one.

224
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,853
Then what was that?

225
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,723
Tamashii.

226
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,157
What's tamashii?

227
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,894
Tamashii are spirits.

228
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,230
They are souls
wandering these woods

229
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,232
until it is their time.

230
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,201
Things are not
what they seem here.

231
00:28:57,203 --> 00:28:59,203
It was probably just an animal.

232
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:02,106
There are very few animals
in aokigahara.

233
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,041
Well, then it was
one of the few.

234
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:08,879
This place
is what you call purgatory.

235
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:11,115
Now, why would I call it that?

236
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:12,583
Because you are American.

237
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,018
- So?
- You believe in god.

238
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:24,928
I'm a scientist.

239
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,330
There are answers for this
in science?

240
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:28,699
There are answers
for everything in science.

241
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:30,634
But not in god?

242
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:33,203
God is more our creation
than we are his.

243
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:36,073
So... why end your life?

244
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:39,743
Excuse me?

245
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:42,246
If god is not waiting for you
on the other side,

246
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:43,647
who is?

247
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,386
Why do you want to die?

248
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,390
I'm here sightseeing.

249
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,859
For sightseeing?

250
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,195
What?

251
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:00,197
I don't know
who the hell you are...

252
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,200
...but I stopped to help you.

253
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:05,369
- You did.
- Yeah, I did.

254
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:33,063
Hey!

255
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,913
I can't... can't move.

256
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,129
Get away from me.

257
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,497
I don't want your help.

258
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,972
'Cause... 'Cause of a job?

259
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,039
Huh?

260
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,474
You got a wife and kid
to go home to

261
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,009
and that's not enough for you.
- On three!

262
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,844
- No, what are you doing?
- One!

263
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:22,212
Two! Three!
- No! No!

264
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,607
Hi.

265
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,509
You okay?

266
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:06,777
Yeah.

267
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,979
I'm sorry.
I must've dozed off.

268
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,285
Is this the jacket
i bought you?

269
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:17,854
Yeah.

270
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,457
You like it?

271
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,593
It's comfortable.

272
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,331
You okay?

273
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,869
You could've burned
the house down, Joan.

274
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,906
I said I was sorry.

275
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:39,543
I almost stopped off
at the store on the way home.

276
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:41,311
If I had...
- Yeah, yeah.

277
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:42,946
The house would be
in ashes right now.

278
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:43,713
Okay?

279
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,916
Is me telling you
how right you are

280
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,685
enough to keep this from
turning into an argument?

281
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,762
It's not the house
that I was concerned about.

282
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,405
You're home early.

283
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,141
Should I feel about that too?

284
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:13,343
It was just
an observation, Joan.

285
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:15,045
You see it all, don't you?

286
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,582
Yeah. You know what?
I do.

287
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:20,750
I see it all.

288
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:22,185
I see you stopped by the bar.

289
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,490
I did, right after I sold
my second house this week.

290
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,325
Well, I'd say
we should celebrate,

291
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:29,693
but obviously
you already have.

292
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:31,194
I'm a grown woman.

293
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:32,796
You're a cliché.

294
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:35,132
I'm a grown woman.

295
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,766
That's an alcoholic.

296
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:38,502
Funny how
the so-called alcoholic's

297
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:40,570
the one who pays the mortgage.

298
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,472
What's your excuse?
- For what?

299
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,508
Get a job.

300
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,643
- I have a job.
- A real job.

301
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:49,579
Not one that pays
20 grand a year.

302
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,081
I like what I do, Joan.

303
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:54,417
Uh-huh, about as much
as you like that jacket.

304
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:58,388
- Like I said, it's--
- comfortable. Yeah, I know.

305
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,890
What's wrong with that?

306
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:02,259
- You don't care anymore.
- About what?

307
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:03,560
Anything!
It's like you've settled

308
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:06,830
on some lesser version
of yourself.

309
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,498
Why can't you just
be happy for me?

310
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,535
Because I'm too busy
feeling bad for myself.

311
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:13,236
At least you admit it.

312
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:13,236
Admit what?

313
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:16,907
That I have a husband that
continuously puts himself first

314
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:18,842
and I'm such a fool
that I keep letting him do it?

315
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,110
Fine! Yeah, I admit it.

316
00:36:20,112 --> 00:36:22,045
You.
You were the one...

317
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,480
...that said I should
quit northlab.

318
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:24,915
That was you!
- Because you hated it there!

319
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:27,984
No, because you hated me there!
Remember?

320
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,219
You hated me there!

321
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:30,687
Are you really gonna
go down that road?

322
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,822
No, I don't.
But apparently you do.

323
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:33,957
As usual.

324
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,526
You quit three years ago.

325
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,228
I figured you'd
find something else by now.

326
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,763
And I have.

327
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:41,631
Really? Yeah?

328
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,233
Please.

329
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:45,335
Don't give me "please."
I have.

330
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,671
You could be doing a hell
of a lot more and you know it.

331
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,475
Stop pretending this has
anything to do with the job.

332
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,077
It has to do with you

333
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,046
continuing to take advantage
of me.

334
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:57,214
Name one time--

335
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,382
- there's been plenty.
- Yeah?

336
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,885
'Cause god forbid you could
take care of me for once.

337
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,086
What are you talkin' about?

338
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:04,754
- It's what you do.
- What?

339
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:07,691
You... you take advantage
of people.

340
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:09,926
Yet you can't give me
any example of when I have.

341
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:12,095
You can't think of anybody
but yourself.

342
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:14,698
If people need you,
when I need you,

343
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,032
there is always something!

344
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:18,368
There is always something
more important to do!

345
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,636
Or...

346
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,772
...or someone.

347
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,212
I knew it.

348
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,718
I knew you couldn't do it.

349
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,954
I knew you couldn't do it.

350
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,155
Well...

351
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,591
You couldn't keep
from bringing it up.

352
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,693
Could you?
- Well, you...

353
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,428
...make it really hard
not to sometimes.

354
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,364
You couldn't keep
from bringing it up.

355
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,635
You had me in the crosshairs
for three years, baby.

356
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,403
- This is how we are.
- Let's drink on it.

357
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:55,272
You and me, let's have a toast

358
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:58,008
to the reason that you,
miss Joan Brennan,

359
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,209
are a drunk.

360
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,144
Let's have a toast to me,

361
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:04,114
your philandering,
selfish husband.

362
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,515
Mmh.

363
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:11,588
I'm done trying
to make amends with you.

364
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,057
- Well, you shouldn't be!
- Well, I am.

365
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,700
Are you okay?

366
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,538
I'm just tired.

367
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,940
Do you need to rest?

368
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:46,516
You need these?

369
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:04,100
Hey, talk to me.

370
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:05,368
What's your name?

371
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:07,437
Takumi.

372
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,572
That your whole name?

373
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,341
Nakamura takumi.

374
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,944
Tell me about your family.

375
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:16,513
My wife...

376
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,615
...kiiro...

377
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,951
...she's so smart...

378
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,286
...charming.

379
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:27,424
We have one daughter, fuyu.

380
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,561
Sorry I yelled...

381
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:35,765
...at you, earlier.

382
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,567
Maybe I deserved.

383
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:38,902
No.

384
00:40:38,904 --> 00:40:40,303
No, you didn't.

385
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,074
Hey... what?

386
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,710
What is it?

387
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,346
Wh... what now?

388
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:51,681
Water.

389
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,152
Water?

390
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,655
Yes, this way!

391
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,690
Oh!

392
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:15,605
Wait, wait.
How do you know
it's okay to drink?

393
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:20,477
I do not, but would rather
get sick later

394
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:21,978
than die tonight.

395
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,246
Good point.

396
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,549
Oh... oh.

397
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,058
For later.

398
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,559
Ah.

399
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,196
We should follow it downstream.

400
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:42,232
It is best way to find help.

401
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,434
Ah!

402
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,202
What's that?

403
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:49,005
Ancient Japanese
survival technique?

404
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,473
No, no.

405
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:52,609
I learned on discovery channel.

406
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:54,410
<i> Man vs. Wild.</i>

407
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,413
Ah.

408
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:01,251
Oh.

409
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,258
Mount fuji...

410
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,093
...where is it?

411
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,729
We could use it
to get our bearings.

412
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,598
The parking lot was just...

413
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,033
...just west of the mountain.

414
00:42:50,035 --> 00:42:51,701
East.

415
00:42:51,703 --> 00:42:52,969
Are you sure?

416
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,443
Hey, hey!

417
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,145
Where you going?

418
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:13,923
It is said
a flower grows

419
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:17,126
when a should has crossed over
from this place.

420
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:21,197
There's hardly any soil.

421
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,100
Yeah.

422
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,910
We should continue.

423
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,910
What do we do now?

424
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,816
I don't know.
It was your idea.

425
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:27,030
What is that?
- What?

426
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:29,399
Right there.

427
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,405
Someone's there.

428
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,140
Hey.

429
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:39,008
Hello?

430
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,474
He's German.

431
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:13,843
There are many others
like him.

432
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:15,945
They come from many countries.

433
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,581
Some are certain of this.

434
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:20,216
Others change mind.

435
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:26,422
Help me take off his clothes.

436
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,310
The mri detected a small mass.

437
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:22,378
No.

438
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:26,849
Right now it's pressing
against your frontal lobe.

439
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:49,372
If you choose resection,

440
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:51,741
which I highly recommend
you do...

441
00:46:51,743 --> 00:46:53,743
...your recovery
will not be swift.

442
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:02,218
It's okay. It's okay.

443
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,586
We got this.

444
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,155
How risky is the surgery?

445
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,992
It's a highly
invasive procedure.

446
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,761
Could I die doing it?

447
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:18,067
- It's possible.
- - But unlikely, right?

448
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:19,569
But unlikely?

449
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,355
Uh, 24, I got c.

450
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,190
2400 joules.

451
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,228
Uh, I couldn't figure out 25.

452
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,896
I couldn't figure out
any of them.

453
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:48,931
It's b, potential energy.

454
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:51,934
- For 25?
- Yeah?

455
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:53,302
Professor?

456
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:01,811
It's velocity, Trey.

457
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,747
The question is
was the velocity positive

458
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:06,282
or was it negative.

459
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,684
Anyone?

460
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,386
Simon?

461
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,854
We're on 25.

462
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:14,023
We're on 26.
The answer's negative.

463
00:48:14,025 --> 00:48:17,560
It's negative velocity.
Why is it negative velocity?

464
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:19,028
You know why?

465
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:20,930
Anna.
- Yeah?

466
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:23,933
Take over.
Run through the quiz
with the rest of the class.

467
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:26,469
Remember that
there's still a force

468
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:28,437
if the velocity is zero.

469
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:31,707
Okay... anybody got 27?

470
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,310
We didn't even
go over this stuff.

471
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:35,678
I know, he just kinda
walked out.

472
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:42,585
Excuse me.

473
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:45,554
Sorry, I just need
to grab that.

474
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:57,233
Hey, hey, talk to me.

475
00:48:57,235 --> 00:48:58,834
About anything.
Talk to me.

476
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:00,269
I'm so cold.

477
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,004
I know. Me too.

478
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,341
Tell me about that song
you were singing.

479
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:06,776
- Song?
- Yeah, yeah.

480
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:08,244
Down by the water.

481
00:49:08,246 --> 00:49:10,413
I don't know.
Maybe I make up.

482
00:49:10,415 --> 00:49:12,982
Y-y-you kept saying the line...

483
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,321
"Rakue... uno...

484
00:49:18,323 --> 00:49:20,256
...Kai-Kai-kaidan..."

485
00:49:20,258 --> 00:49:21,624
<i> Rakuen eno kaidan.</i>

486
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,059
- Uh-huh?
<i> - Hai.</i>

487
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:25,628
It's old song.
- Okay.

488
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,230
Kaidan means "stairway."

489
00:49:28,232 --> 00:49:30,967
"Stairway to paradise."

490
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:34,937
Like "stair-stairway
to heaven"?

491
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:37,640
No, no. Different.

492
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:39,141
Much shorter.

493
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,476
That's funny.

494
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:43,279
It's... it's from movie.

495
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,082
American movies.

496
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,484
Gene Kelly.
- Uh-huh?

497
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:51,887
Why do you love the song?

498
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:53,255
Why do you love this song?

499
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:56,092
I'm most happy
near the water.

500
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:57,760
It is my paradise.

501
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:02,331
The song make me think
of good memories there.

502
00:50:04,936 --> 00:50:06,869
That's where you should go
when you get out of here.

503
00:50:06,871 --> 00:50:09,005
You hear me? Hey!
That's where you should go.

504
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:10,873
- I like that.
- Okay.

505
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,677
Will you?

506
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,016
I don't know.

507
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,825
Gotta find shelter.

508
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:31,894
We can't... stay here.

509
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,581
Over here!

510
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,417
I'm here!

511
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:09,932
In here!

512
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,112
Look at me.
Listen to me.

513
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:24,847
Listen to me.
We're gonna be okay.

514
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,882
I promise you I'm gonna
get you out of here.

515
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:28,284
You hear me?

516
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:49,705
Takumi!

517
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:55,244
Ah!

518
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,507
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no.

519
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:00,843
No, no, no, no.

520
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:05,648
No!

521
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:11,820
No!

522
00:53:15,126 --> 00:53:17,726
Ah, come here.
It's me. It's me.

523
00:53:17,728 --> 00:53:22,565
Breathe, breathe.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

524
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:23,699
Ah.

525
00:53:25,403 --> 00:53:26,569
Tent.

526
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,405
A tent.

527
00:55:05,303 --> 00:55:07,303
Hel-help.

528
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:09,104
Help. We need help.

529
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:18,013
Say-say-say we need help.
Say we need help.

530
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,277
Hands, hands, hands, hands.

531
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,260
You still have time to eat.

532
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:08,731
Doc said 12 hours
before cutoff.

533
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:15,904
I don't think I'm hungry.

534
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:17,239
It's all right.

535
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:22,945
I guess I'm gonna have to
eat this all by myself, huh?

536
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,088
What are you?

537
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,562
Afraid.

538
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,602
Well you... you should be.

539
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:49,004
Your chair's broken.

540
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:52,174
Yeah, well why not add

541
00:56:52,176 --> 00:56:54,343
falling off a chair
to the list?

542
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,316
I don't wanna die, Arthur.

543
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:05,854
Listen to me.

544
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:07,689
Mm-mmh.

545
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:09,825
You're not gonna die.

546
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:13,195
You're not.

547
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:18,367
It's not-it's not the thought
of dying that scares me.

548
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:21,303
It's the thought of
dying there, at a hospital.

549
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:22,805
In some...

550
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:26,141
...cold, empty room
surrounded by people

551
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:28,811
who are only there
because it's their job to be.

552
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,216
I'll see if I can...

553
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:36,718
...stay in the operating room.

554
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:45,160
I don't think
they let people do that.

555
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:48,063
I don't think they do either,
but I'll try.

556
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,517
Promise me something, Arthur.

557
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:12,454
Promise me that
whenever it's your time...

558
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,192
...promise me it won't be
in a place like that.

559
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,266
Okay.

560
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,735
I'm serious.

561
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:33,609
Just promise me it'll be
the perfect place.

562
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:36,545
You make it sound
like I'm gonna know

563
00:58:36,547 --> 00:58:39,147
when that time is.
- Yeah, I think you will.

564
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:44,887
I think deep down
we all do.

565
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,226
Please?

566
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:59,101
Okay.

567
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,237
I promise.

568
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,341
I promise.

569
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,334
You must know by now

570
01:00:39,336 --> 01:00:42,604
this forest,
it is very powerful.

571
01:00:42,606 --> 01:00:45,807
Uh-huh.
I know it's very cold.

572
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,442
Have you tried his compass?

573
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:57,719
Where are you, compass?

574
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:08,864
Doesn't work.

575
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:11,166
Must be the volcanic rock.

576
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,869
The high iron deposits
are throwing it off.

577
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:15,404
There's more than that.

578
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,379
You make it sound like this
forest is keeping us here.

579
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:26,348
It seems to have a reason.

580
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,884
Just as it did
for bringing us here.

581
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:36,324
Okay, so why do you think
he brought all his things?

582
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:38,093
As I said before...

583
01:01:38,095 --> 01:01:41,063
...some people are sure
when they come,

584
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:42,497
others are not.

585
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:45,400
You think he was unsure?

586
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:47,769
And then I think he got lost.

587
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,639
That happens often, too.

588
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,843
The ribbons.

589
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:56,078
Ribbons?

590
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,682
Yeah, the ribbons.
There was the-the strings...

591
01:02:00,684 --> 01:02:03,952
...tied up between the trees.
I saw them on the way in.

592
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:10,659
They help people
find their way back, like...

593
01:02:10,661 --> 01:02:11,960
...bread crumbs.

594
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:16,131
I wonder if one of
those ribbons were his.

595
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:18,200
I wonder if any are yours.

596
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,840
I used actual bread crumbs.

597
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:27,976
You are handsome.

598
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:30,846
Pardon?

599
01:02:30,848 --> 01:02:32,714
You used bread crumbs.

600
01:02:32,716 --> 01:02:34,649
Handsome and gretel.

601
01:02:37,755 --> 01:02:39,154
What?

602
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:46,328
Hansel and gretel.

603
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:55,070
Had me worried there
for a second.

604
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,176
The sky is darker.

605
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:06,214
I thought just the opposite.

606
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:09,918
Is it morning yet?

607
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,159
It's ten after three.

608
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:25,300
What?

609
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:29,104
Does she know you are here?

610
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:32,707
Who?

611
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,478
Who you talkin' about?

612
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,246
She's why you are here.

613
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:44,953
What is your name?

614
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:50,091
Arthur.

615
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,529
What was her name?

616
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,235
Joan.

617
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:02,637
Joan...

618
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:05,173
When did she--
- two weeks ago.

619
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:10,145
You must have had...
Very nice marriage with her.

620
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:14,916
No.

621
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:18,653
Was it always bad?

622
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:22,924
No.

623
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:27,362
No, we had a lot
of really great years.

624
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:28,797
A lot of 'em.

625
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:31,099
What changed?

626
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:43,745
We did.

627
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:50,719
She was an alcoholic.

628
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:54,890
A functioning alcoholic,
which supposedly made it...

629
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:56,658
...okay, but she was...

630
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:00,996
...she was horrible
to me sometimes.

631
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:05,467
I was even worse to her.

632
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,845
A few years ago
i had an affair...

633
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:20,982
...with a coworker
from a research lab,

634
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:23,385
but i-i didn't tell her.

635
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,490
She found out on her own.

636
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:30,859
Which-which...

637
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,062
Which made it worse,
i think.

638
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:42,304
Things went downhill
from there.

639
01:05:42,306 --> 01:05:46,241
She-she...
She started drinking more.

640
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:55,483
The more she despised me,
the more she...

641
01:05:55,485 --> 01:05:56,985
...hated herself.

642
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,057
I gave her a reason to drink.

643
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,826
I was her excuse to drink.

644
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:10,332
We almost got divorced...
Twice.

645
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:17,272
She never trusted me again.

646
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:26,047
I can't blame her
'cause I didn't let her.

647
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:28,416
Did you love her?

648
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,453
No, it...

649
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:35,957
...it was just
a meaningless fling.

650
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:37,525
I meant your wife.

651
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:43,064
More than anything on earth.

652
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:47,335
So... why do that to her?

653
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:54,242
I... I don't know.
I just did.

654
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:55,844
I mean...

655
01:06:55,846 --> 01:06:57,979
It wasn't something
i thought about.
I just did it.

656
01:06:57,981 --> 01:06:59,881
Sometimes you do things.

657
01:06:59,883 --> 01:07:02,050
As much as you'd wanna
take 'em back...

658
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,753
...you can't.

659
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:12,260
After that...

660
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:17,665
...we pretty much started
keeping our feelings
for each other...

661
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:19,034
...a secret.

662
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:25,440
Like, I would fix things
for her, but...

663
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:28,043
...you know, only in
the middle of the night

664
01:07:28,045 --> 01:07:30,245
when she was asleep,
or when...

665
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:31,613
...she was out.

666
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:35,016
Like, I'd buy her
a box of tea...

667
01:07:35,018 --> 01:07:36,184
...a new one...

668
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:39,320
...and I'd wait until...

669
01:07:39,322 --> 01:07:41,189
...the old package
wasn't too full

670
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:43,858
or too empty
before refilling it.

671
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:46,661
That way she wouldn't know...

672
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:52,934
And that way
she wouldn't have to...

673
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:54,969
...choose whether or not
to thank me.

674
01:07:58,207 --> 01:07:59,607
Hmm.

675
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:02,343
Then she, uh...

676
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:05,980
I found my shirts...

677
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:09,951
...cleaned and pressed
in the back of my closet,

678
01:08:09,953 --> 01:08:12,554
only i-i-i hadn't washed 'em.

679
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:17,459
She purposefully put 'em
way in the back

680
01:08:17,461 --> 01:08:19,627
so, by the time
that I got to 'em...

681
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,465
...I'd forget they were dirty
in the first place

682
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:26,267
and I wouldn't have to choose
whether or not...

683
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,705
...to tell her
i appreciated her.

684
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:36,177
This little game we had.

685
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,416
No consequences.
No "thank yous."

686
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:45,720
It was a game,
but it was all we had.

687
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:57,665
Then she got sick...

688
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,573
...and all the anger,
and the pretending,

689
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:07,742
and the fighting,
it all-it all...

690
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:10,712
...it all got put on hold.

691
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:15,850
It's always that moment.
You know?

692
01:09:15,852 --> 01:09:17,952
Life-changing moment that...

693
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:22,056
...knocks us on the floor

694
01:09:22,058 --> 01:09:24,159
and reminds us
what really matters.

695
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:29,030
The thing about those moments
is they come and they go

696
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:30,832
and sometimes they...

697
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:37,639
...they come too late.

698
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:42,043
Too late.

699
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,783
I didn't come here
because of the loss.

700
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:54,589
I didn't come here
because of the grief.

701
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:01,930
I came here bec-

702
01:10:01,932 --> 01:10:03,932
because of the guilt.

703
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:11,206
I was wrong to treat my wife
the way I treated her

704
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,808
and she was wrong to treat me
how she did.

705
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:21,182
Now neither one of us are ever
gonna get the chance to say...

706
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,587
...I'm sorry.

707
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:30,024
She's listening.

708
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:35,396
No she's not.

709
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,166
It is during our darkest times

710
01:10:38,168 --> 01:10:40,101
that our loved ones
are closest.

711
01:10:40,103 --> 01:10:42,270
Even those who have passed.

712
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:44,906
Her spirit...

713
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,341
No, it's not.

714
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:48,676
She's with you.

715
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:54,983
This forest holds her for you.

716
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,387
It is true.

717
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:04,726
I'm sorry.

718
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:14,569
Please...

719
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:18,906
No, I'm sorry.

720
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:22,477
I'm sor--
I'm sorry.

721
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:27,849
I'm sorry.

722
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:30,885
I'm sorry.

723
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:35,790
I'm sorry.

724
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:38,760
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

725
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:45,600
I don't know if I can live
without her.

726
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,406
You do not have to...

727
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:53,608
...forever.

728
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:26,174
Been on vacation?

729
01:12:28,144 --> 01:12:29,344
No.

730
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:31,346
Well, your box has been full
all week.

731
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:37,952
I haven't emptied it yet.

732
01:12:37,954 --> 01:12:40,288
Right, right.
That's what I'm sayin'.

733
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:42,890
Anyway.

734
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:39,907
Help. Help.
Is anybody there?

735
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:41,142
Please.
We need help.

736
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,187
Takumi.
Get up, takumi.

737
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:54,922
Hey, wake up.
Wake up.

738
01:14:54,924 --> 01:14:57,291
There's no fire.
No more fire.

739
01:14:57,293 --> 01:14:59,293
No more fire.
We have to go.

740
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:00,895
Up. Up.

741
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:03,364
Hey, come on.
Come on.

742
01:15:03,366 --> 01:15:05,967
We have to go.

743
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:14,075
I can't carry you.
Can you walk?

744
01:15:14,077 --> 01:15:15,576
You should go.

745
01:15:17,313 --> 01:15:19,380
Hey, okay, listen.

746
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:21,883
I'm coming back.
Okay?

747
01:15:21,885 --> 01:15:23,584
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna get help.

748
01:15:23,586 --> 01:15:25,520
I swear I'm coming back
to get you.

749
01:15:25,522 --> 01:15:27,421
Okay? Okay?

750
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:31,058
Thank you...

751
01:15:32,895 --> 01:15:34,495
...for taking care of me.

752
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:36,297
Hey, hey.

753
01:15:36,299 --> 01:15:38,099
I'll be back.
I'll be back.

754
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:42,436
Lay down.

755
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,575
I'll be back.
I promise.

756
01:15:47,577 --> 01:15:49,510
Okay?
I promise.

757
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:58,553
I'll be back.
I'll be back.

758
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:06,661
I'll be back.

759
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:31,118
Hello. Hello.

760
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,554
Hello. Are you there?
We need help.

761
01:16:33,556 --> 01:16:35,456
Please, send an ambulance.

762
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,395
Shit.

763
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:45,026
Yeah? Huh.

764
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:29,570
Oh, remember this hat?

765
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,941
- Where is that?
- I have no idea.

766
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:36,544
What was this?
Like '90... '98? '99?

767
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:38,779
Oh.

768
01:18:38,781 --> 01:18:42,750
Yeah, it must've been, 'cause
there's the old north lab logo,

769
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:44,985
and they changed it
at the turn of the millennium.

770
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:49,323
Sorry.

771
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:54,829
It's okay.

772
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:56,163
Stop.

773
01:18:57,699 --> 01:19:01,602
Uh, okay, there we are
at the lake house.

774
01:19:01,604 --> 01:19:03,337
I loved that lake.

775
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:03,337
Yeah, you did.

776
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:06,807
Just being near the water.

777
01:19:06,809 --> 01:19:08,676
It's my paradise.

778
01:19:08,678 --> 01:19:10,878
You know what your favorite
thing to do was?

779
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,480
At least from my eye,
you used to love

780
01:19:12,482 --> 01:19:14,615
to go down there and walk.

781
01:19:14,617 --> 01:19:15,716
Those orchids.

782
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:17,651
You'd be down there for hours,

783
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:20,287
then you'd walk
back up the stairs

784
01:19:20,289 --> 01:19:22,890
and you'd line 'em up
right across that windowsill.

785
01:19:22,892 --> 01:19:24,859
You remember that.

786
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:28,028
Of course I do.

787
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,800
We can go back there
whenever you want to.

788
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:35,002
Okay.

789
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:38,038
Hey...

790
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:44,378
You made it past
the first step, okay?

791
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,314
You already crossed
the first hurled and that's...

792
01:19:47,316 --> 01:19:49,250
...that's a good sign.

793
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:52,153
I'm just nervous.

794
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:57,057
I don't know.
I've been so angry.

795
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:00,828
So many things.

796
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:09,170
Listen.

797
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:13,007
Let's both get
one of those hats.

798
01:20:13,009 --> 01:20:14,742
Both of us.

799
01:20:14,744 --> 01:20:16,043
Okay?

800
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:19,346
What if I want a frilly hat?

801
01:20:19,348 --> 01:20:21,615
Well then, I guess I'm gonna
have to wear a frilly hat.

802
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:23,384
You can't wear a--

803
01:20:23,386 --> 01:20:24,985
I can pull off
a frilly hat.

804
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,487
You don't think
i could pull off a frilly hat?

805
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:29,390
- You'll look like a girl.
- I don't care.

806
01:20:29,392 --> 01:20:32,059
I can handle frilly
and feathers.

807
01:20:32,061 --> 01:20:33,694
Go for it.

808
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:36,497
Hey.
- Hey.

809
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:42,136
We finally received the results
from the tests,

810
01:20:42,138 --> 01:20:43,637
and...

811
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:46,040
...the mass was non-malignant.

812
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:05,659
How are you feeling?

813
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:10,497
Um, after that
i feel pretty great.

814
01:21:10,499 --> 01:21:12,867
You dealing with the pain okay?

815
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:14,702
Yeah, it's...

816
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:16,804
...just a little sore here.

817
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:19,840
It's gonna sting a little.

818
01:21:19,842 --> 01:21:21,008
So...

819
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,610
...the plan is still
to transport you

820
01:21:22,612 --> 01:21:24,979
over to the recovery unit
at St. Mary's.

821
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:32,820
Thank you.

822
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:46,133
Listen, okay?
Listen.

823
01:21:46,135 --> 01:21:47,701
Have this on you.

824
01:21:47,703 --> 01:21:49,036
I'll call you on the way

825
01:21:49,038 --> 01:21:51,839
so you have some company,
okay?

826
01:21:51,841 --> 01:21:53,607
It's okay if she has the phone
in there, right?

827
01:21:53,609 --> 01:21:54,942
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

828
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,443
You got the car?

829
01:21:56,445 --> 01:21:57,978
Right behind you, baby.

830
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,014
Okay.

831
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:01,749
Call me.

832
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:05,486
I hope to even text you
inappropriate photos

833
01:22:05,488 --> 01:22:09,123
while I'm driving
tonight!

834
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:10,524
Tonight!

835
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:12,393
You're crazy.

836
01:22:12,395 --> 01:22:14,728
Cheeseburger, Margarita,
little dancing.

837
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:20,034
<i> Are you there?</i>

838
01:22:20,036 --> 01:22:21,769
Mm-hmm.

839
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:23,804
<i> - Hi.</i>
- Are you cozy?

840
01:22:23,806 --> 01:22:25,806
Are you cozy up there?

841
01:22:25,808 --> 01:22:28,809
<i> - Yeah.</i>
- I am right behind you, baby.

842
01:22:28,811 --> 01:22:32,346
<i> - I can see you.</i>
- You can see me?

843
01:22:32,348 --> 01:22:34,915
<i> Through those dark</i>
<i> tinted windows?</i>

844
01:22:34,917 --> 01:22:36,951
Yeah, I can see a little bit.

845
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:39,019
<i> Oh, wave.</i>
<i> Can you wave?</i>

846
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:42,489
<i> You can't see me,</i>
<i> I'm sure.</i>

847
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:44,992
No, I don't.
I don't see you.

848
01:22:46,995 --> 01:22:49,663
My god, it's weird.

849
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:51,365
It's bumpy in here.

850
01:22:51,367 --> 01:22:54,034
You've never ridden in the back
of an ambulance before?

851
01:22:54,036 --> 01:22:56,737
<i> No, actually.</i>

852
01:22:56,739 --> 01:22:57,972
Not even as a kid?

853
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,375
No, never.

854
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:05,079
Why is that so hard to believe?

855
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:08,148
<i> It's not hard to believe</i>
<i> that you've never</i>

856
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,450
<i> been in the back</i>
<i> of an ambulance before.</i>

857
01:23:09,452 --> 01:23:12,152
<i> It's just hard to believe</i>
<i> that I had no idea...</i>

858
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:14,755
...that you've never been in the
back of an ambulance before.

859
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:19,927
Well, I'm sure there's things
about you I don't know.

860
01:23:21,764 --> 01:23:23,530
<i> You know,</i>
<i> I somehow doubt that.</i>

861
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:27,634
Okay.

862
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:32,139
What's your favorite color?

863
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,408
Oh, now you're messing with me.

864
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:36,643
Like you don't know
my favorite color?

865
01:23:36,645 --> 01:23:37,978
Huh?

866
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,546
What's mine?

867
01:23:39,548 --> 01:23:41,548
<i> Your favorite color is...</i>

868
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:42,883
<i> ...um...</i>

869
01:23:42,885 --> 01:23:45,119
You got me.
Hi, my name is Arthur.

870
01:23:45,121 --> 01:23:47,421
Um, nice to meet you.

871
01:23:47,423 --> 01:23:49,490
Who is this beautiful person--

872
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:54,695
Joan!

873
01:24:00,269 --> 01:24:01,568
Joan!

874
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:06,840
Joan!

875
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:45,446
I hear you.
I hear you.

876
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:53,454
I read you.
I'm here.

877
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:09,069
Stairway, stairway, s...

878
01:25:09,071 --> 01:25:10,671
Stairway...

879
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:17,845
Stairway, stairway...

880
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:20,681
<i> Rakuen kaidan...</i>

881
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:23,350
<i> K-kaidan...</i>

882
01:25:27,223 --> 01:25:28,555
<i> Kaidan.</i>

883
01:28:42,784 --> 01:28:44,418
Hey...

884
01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:47,721
Ha...

885
01:29:01,703 --> 01:29:03,670
Sir? Sir?

886
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:05,272
Are you okay, sir?

887
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:15,849
Yeh... yeh... yeh...

888
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:17,484
You have to get him.

889
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:21,822
He... he... he's still in there.

890
01:29:21,824 --> 01:29:24,124
He... he's still in there.

891
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:33,266
He's still in there.

892
01:29:44,946 --> 01:29:46,246
He...

893
01:29:50,618 --> 01:29:51,918
He's still in there.

894
01:30:28,991 --> 01:30:30,524
Mr. Brennan?

895
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:32,459
Sir?

896
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:35,896
We're locking up
for the evening.

897
01:30:35,898 --> 01:30:37,297
I'm sorry.

898
01:30:41,903 --> 01:30:44,337
Can I get another minute?

899
01:30:44,339 --> 01:30:45,806
Of course.

900
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:52,112
It was very well attended.

901
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:56,383
She obviously was very loved.

902
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:06,159
I didn't know her.

903
01:31:07,161 --> 01:31:08,562
I'm sorry?

904
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:11,698
My wife.

905
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,907
I didn't really know her.

906
01:31:26,047 --> 01:31:28,482
I mean, i-i-i knew...

907
01:31:28,484 --> 01:31:32,886
...you know, the date
her car insurance
needed to be renewed...

908
01:31:32,888 --> 01:31:35,021
...and her
social security number...

909
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:42,062
Thing-things
that seemed important.

910
01:31:45,233 --> 01:31:47,400
I didn't know her favorite...

911
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:50,604
...her favorite color.

912
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:55,642
I don't know
her favorite season.

913
01:31:58,946 --> 01:32:00,814
I don't know her favorite book.

914
01:32:02,884 --> 01:32:04,918
It was a children's story.

915
01:32:06,988 --> 01:32:09,389
I overheard her sisters
talking about it earlier.

916
01:32:09,391 --> 01:32:12,325
Apparently one of them
ordered it for her recently.

917
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:16,563
No mention of a favorite color
or season, though.

918
01:32:16,565 --> 01:32:17,931
I'm sorry.

919
01:32:21,269 --> 01:32:22,736
Take your time, sir.

920
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:50,564
We do play baseball, you know.

921
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:56,236
Yes.
This is more entertaining.

922
01:32:56,238 --> 01:32:57,737
If you say so.

923
01:32:57,739 --> 01:32:59,139
Let me take a look.

924
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:06,012
It's healing nicely.

925
01:33:06,981 --> 01:33:08,448
How are you feeling?

926
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:10,684
Better.

927
01:33:11,152 --> 01:33:12,519
Better is good.

928
01:33:12,521 --> 01:33:13,920
Better is very good.

929
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:14,988
Glasses.

930
01:33:17,658 --> 01:33:19,326
Look at my finger.

931
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:21,428
It's bright.

932
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:23,897
It's a light shining
right in your eyeball.

933
01:33:23,899 --> 01:33:25,732
It should be.

934
01:33:25,734 --> 01:33:26,866
Good.

935
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:29,836
Don't tell me
you're playing along.

936
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,175
No, this is s-
this is something else.

937
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:39,145
Channel five.
It's the seventh inning.

938
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:59,032
Why did you go to aokigahara?

939
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:01,301
It wasn't working.

940
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:02,569
What wasn't?

941
01:34:03,904 --> 01:34:05,071
Moving on.

942
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,174
Do you still want
to end your life?

943
01:34:10,411 --> 01:34:11,478
No.

944
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:15,315
What do you plan to do
after you leave the hospital?

945
01:34:15,317 --> 01:34:16,783
Go back to the forest.

946
01:34:18,786 --> 01:34:22,122
I made a promise to someone
and I'm going to keep it.

947
01:34:22,124 --> 01:34:25,291
You are speaking of the other
person who was with you?

948
01:34:25,293 --> 01:34:26,626
I have to find him.

949
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,928
As I understand it,

950
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:30,930
the park rangers already tried.

951
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:36,469
It's a... it's a big forest.
Trust me.

952
01:34:36,471 --> 01:34:38,405
There's a video camera
in the parking lot.

953
01:34:38,407 --> 01:34:39,639
I know.
I saw it.

954
01:34:39,641 --> 01:34:42,876
And it saw you on the day
you entered the forest.

955
01:34:42,878 --> 01:34:44,377
The rangers
reviewed the footage

956
01:34:44,379 --> 01:34:46,813
from the day
you say he entered.

957
01:34:46,815 --> 01:34:49,482
No one entered aokigahara
that day.

958
01:34:49,484 --> 01:34:50,750
Look.

959
01:34:52,053 --> 01:34:54,120
I was there with someone.

960
01:34:54,122 --> 01:34:55,789
I mean, I don't know...

961
01:34:56,791 --> 01:34:59,893
...which particular way
he entered the forest.

962
01:34:59,895 --> 01:35:02,495
I don't know what particular
day he got there.

963
01:35:02,497 --> 01:35:05,632
I do know that when I left him
he was dying.

964
01:35:05,634 --> 01:35:07,333
The fact remains,

965
01:35:07,335 --> 01:35:09,035
without any visual confirmation

966
01:35:09,037 --> 01:35:10,904
we have no way
of identifying him,

967
01:35:10,906 --> 01:35:13,440
and therefore, no way
of notifying his family.

968
01:35:13,442 --> 01:35:15,709
His name was takumi Nakamura.

969
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:17,410
There are thousands
with that name.

970
01:35:17,412 --> 01:35:19,045
He had a family.

971
01:35:19,047 --> 01:35:22,415
He had a wife named kiiro,

972
01:35:22,417 --> 01:35:24,117
and a...

973
01:35:24,885 --> 01:35:27,787
...and a child named fuyu.

974
01:35:28,522 --> 01:35:30,390
Mr. Brennan, there are not...

975
01:35:30,392 --> 01:35:32,258
I'm telling you,
all right,

976
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:33,793
he's in there somewhere.

977
01:35:33,795 --> 01:35:35,361
I don't doubt that.

978
01:35:35,363 --> 01:35:38,364
You said the rangers
scouted the forest?

979
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,367
Did they find a tent?

980
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:42,869
I left him
by a tent.

981
01:35:42,871 --> 01:35:44,170
It's been two weeks.

982
01:35:44,172 --> 01:35:45,772
- It's been 12 days.
- Still...

983
01:35:45,774 --> 01:35:47,407
Answer my question.

984
01:35:48,075 --> 01:35:49,709
Did they find a tent?

985
01:35:51,545 --> 01:35:54,013
There was no sign
of the person you described.

986
01:39:17,351 --> 01:39:18,751
Takumi!

987
01:39:56,557 --> 01:39:59,058
<i> Things are not</i>
<i> as they seem here.</i>

988
01:40:01,762 --> 01:40:05,098
<i> This forest</i>
<i> is what you call purgatory.</i>

989
01:40:08,803 --> 01:40:11,371
<i> No one entered the forest</i>
<i> that day.</i>

990
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,475
<i> It is during</i>
<i> our darkest times</i>

991
01:40:15,477 --> 01:40:18,044
<i> that our loved ones</i>
<i> are closest.</i>

992
01:40:18,046 --> 01:40:20,446
<i> Even those who have passed.</i>

993
01:40:24,885 --> 01:40:26,452
<i> Promise me.</i>

994
01:40:26,454 --> 01:40:29,188
<i> Promise me you'll find</i>
<i> the perfect place.</i>

995
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:33,893
<i> It is said a flower grows</i>

996
01:40:33,895 --> 01:40:37,230
<i> when a soul has crossed over</i>
<i> from this place.</i>

997
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:41,901
<i> Did you love her?</i>

998
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:45,204
<i> More than anything</i>
<i> on earth.</i>

999
01:40:47,809 --> 01:40:49,675
<i> She is with you.</i>

1000
01:40:49,677 --> 01:40:52,011
<i> This forest holds her</i>
<i> for you.</i>

1001
01:41:07,796 --> 01:41:10,530
<i> Thank you</i>
<i> for taking care of me.</i>

1002
01:41:15,769 --> 01:41:17,870
<i> I don't know how</i>
<i> to live without her.</i>

1003
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:21,507
<i> You will not have to.</i>

1004
01:41:21,509 --> 01:41:23,142
<i> Not forever.</i>

1005
01:41:53,273 --> 01:41:54,340
Good morning, sir.

1006
01:41:55,309 --> 01:41:57,577
- Good morning.
- Would you like breakfast?

1007
01:41:57,579 --> 01:41:58,578
Yes, please.

1008
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:00,413
Cereal or omelette?

1009
01:42:00,415 --> 01:42:02,281
Um... omelette.

1010
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:03,683
Yes, sir.

1011
01:42:06,553 --> 01:42:07,920
<i> Arigato.</i>

1012
01:43:15,155 --> 01:43:16,489
<i> How can I help you?</i>

1013
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:20,760
I just didn't understand
this section on, uh, on...

1014
01:43:20,762 --> 01:43:22,161
...column's law.

1015
01:43:22,163 --> 01:43:24,330
It's coulomb's law.
It's a good one.

1016
01:43:24,332 --> 01:43:26,199
Yeah, I didn't think
any of 'em were good.

1017
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:28,000
No, this one is.
Trust me.

1018
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:32,038
Coulomb's law is based
on electrostatic forces,
all right,

1019
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:32,038
and those are very important,
actually,

1020
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:35,174
some of the most important
thing in all of the universe,

1021
01:43:35,176 --> 01:43:37,577
because...
They keep us together.

1022
01:43:37,579 --> 01:43:39,979
Now the question here is
with electrostatic forces

1023
01:43:39,981 --> 01:43:42,348
of attraction and repulsion.

1024
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:45,751
They are directly proportional
to what?

1025
01:43:45,753 --> 01:43:47,119
Yellow winter.

1026
01:43:47,621 --> 01:43:48,788
Yellow winter?

1027
01:43:49,289 --> 01:43:51,224
Yeah. Right here...

1028
01:43:51,892 --> 01:43:53,759
...on this little slip of paper.

1029
01:43:53,761 --> 01:43:55,261
You wrote that, right?

1030
01:43:56,196 --> 01:43:57,430
- This?
- Yeah.

1031
01:43:57,931 --> 01:43:59,899
Kiiro. Fuyu.

1032
01:43:59,901 --> 01:44:02,134
Yellow and winter.

1033
01:44:03,704 --> 01:44:04,937
You speak Japanese?

1034
01:44:06,641 --> 01:44:08,507
Yeah, I do.

1035
01:44:08,509 --> 01:44:10,209
Me and my dad were stationed
in okinawa.

1036
01:44:10,211 --> 01:44:12,144
I went to elementary
school there.

1037
01:44:13,013 --> 01:44:14,347
These are not names?

1038
01:44:14,815 --> 01:44:16,082
No.

1039
01:44:16,084 --> 01:44:17,650
No, not really, they're...

1040
01:44:17,652 --> 01:44:19,285
...a color and a season.

1041
01:44:34,001 --> 01:44:35,234
Professor?

1042
01:44:43,176 --> 01:44:47,780
It-it's directly proportional
to the electrical charges,
and it's...

1043
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:52,218
...inversely proportional
to the square of the distance.
