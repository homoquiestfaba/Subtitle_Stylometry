1
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,270
Hello?

2
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:14,050
Andou? You're sounding cheery as usual. 
It's coming up on two years now, you know.

3
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,660
Is there a reason you're calling first thing in the morning?

4
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,370
Look... It's Takayama Ryuji. He's dead.

5
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,650
Who?

6
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,430
Takayama Ryuji.  You know, our classmate from medical school. 
Takayama Ryuji!

7
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,800
Cut the crap.  If this is a joke, it's not funny.

8
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,430
Would I joke about something like this? 
They say it might even have been a suicide.

9
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,470
Suicide? Takayama Ryuji, kill himself?

10
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,200
Or it might be something else. It looks like they're 
gonna have to do a little more investigating.  
They've scheduled an administrative autopsy.

11
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,350
What are you saying?

12
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,130
The body that you're slated to autopsy today... it's Takayama Ryuji.

13
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,130
I'll see you at the hospital. Bye.

14
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:24,970
According to one of the pathologists there were 
no external injuries to speak of. The cause of death is 
still unknown, hence this administrative autopsy.

15
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,500
We're waiting on the results of your autopsy, but we have 
sufficient reason to believe that this was a homicide. 
If that's the case the court would order a second autopsy...

16
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,590
They're saying it's Sudden Death Syndrome.

17
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,480
Sudden Death...

18
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,030
They found the body at his place yesterday morning.

19
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,780
There's no mistake. It's Takayama Ryuji.

20
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,710
I've got it! You have to use a rendering of the amino acids in DNA.

21
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,480
You plug the numbers into this chart and then use 
the resulting abbreviation.  Isn't that right?

22
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,900
Ripper.

23
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,050
"He who slices."

24
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,310
And what is that supposed to mean? Takayama?

25
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,770
Still don't get it, huh?

26
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,930
It's you.

27
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,260
Your future.

28
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,020
"Ripper"...

29
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,620
Let's get started.

30
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,740
1,520.

31
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,470
Seeing some necrosis here on the left side of the heart.

32
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,920
There's arterial blockage.

33
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,090
Direct cause of death is heart attack brought on 
by blockage of the left pulmonary artery.

34
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,580
There's a small tumor in his throat.

35
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,050
Let's go ahead and take a sample.

36
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,030
OK.

37
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,670
You can't even slit your own wrist...

38
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,260
But you're pretty good at slicing up other people, huh?

39
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,110
Andou!

40
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,310
Dr. Andou? There was something strange in his stomach.

41
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,070
Takayama Ryuji. Lecturer at the Science and 
Technology Department of Kyouei University.

42
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,240
He would appear to have been something of a... 
trange man, wouldn't you agree?

43
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,980
His ex-wife, Asakawa Reiko.

44
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,530
That boy in the picture is their son.

45
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:15,050
Ryuji and his ex-wife never kept in touch with one another, 
but it looks like recently the two had been in close contact.

46
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,010
Is there some suspicion regarding his cause of death?

47
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,280
Asakawa Reiko entered Ryuji's apartment at about 
the time that the ambulance arrived.

48
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,130
But after that she returned home and retrieved her son.  
The two are now missing.

49
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,780
Missing?

50
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,540
And one of the ambulance crew saw her with a 
videotape taken from Mr. Takayama's aprtment.

51
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,050
A videotape?

52
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,810
Mr. Takayama placed a phone call to Asakawa Reiko just before he died.

53
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,990
But the first person to find his body was Mr. Takayama's girlfriend.

54
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,870
According to her she just happened to stop by his apartment, 
where she found him already dead.  It'd be stranger to think 
that some sort of foul play was NOT involved.

55
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,610
But... he died from a heart attack, you know?

56
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,100
It doesn't make sense, does it?

57
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,030
Why not meet Mr. Takayama's girlfriend for yourself?

58
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,170
She's a gloomy one, though. Our questioning isn't going anywhere...

59
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:44,320
This is Dr. Andou, who was in charge of the autopsy. 
This is Takano Mai, the first person to discover the body.

60
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,250
Please tell us again about when you found the body.  
To the doctor, this time.

61
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,710
There was nothing to make us think it was suicide OR murder.

62
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,070
What I want to ask you about is Mr. Takayama's health.

63
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,090
His health?

64
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,110
His body didn't look like one that'd suddenly died from 
heart failure.

65
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:25,970
Did he ever mention anything to you about chest pains, 
or lack of energy?

66
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,100
...No.

67
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:41,130
Ms. Takano.  Yesterday morning, what made you decide
to suddenly go to Takayama Ryuji's apartment?

68
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,090
Asakawa Reiko took her son and disappeared to... 
where, I wonder?

69
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,990
Tell us what you can recall.

70
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,720
I don't know anything.

71
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,360
Please answer the question.

72
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,180
I don't know anything. I really don't.

73
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,400
Why won't you answer? Tell us what you know.

74
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,770
You knew that Takayama Ryuji was meeting with his ex-wife, 
didn't you?

75
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,260
Why won't you speak? You're not hiding something, are you?!

76
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,690
Tell me everything you know!

77
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,980
Talk!

78
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,720
Just a...  Mr. Maekawa!

79
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,180
I know who you are, Mr. Andou.

80
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:05,530
I heard about you a month or so ago.  From Dr. Takayama.

81
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,550
About me? What did you hear?

82
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:19,320
That when you were students everyone was into code-making.

83
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,670
We'd use our knowledge of various medical terminologies 
to come up with our codes...

84
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,700
But the ones that Takayama made were always the 
hardest to solve.

85
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,250
He was a pretty intelligent guy, wasn't he?

86
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:43,560
"Andou was the only one that ever broke my codes," he said.

87
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:04,140
Before he died... Dr. Takayama was 
investigating something with Reiko.

88
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,430
Investigating what?

89
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,530
A videotape.

90
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,420
A videotape?

91
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,580
Whoever watches it dies.

92
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,630
Whoever watches it dies?

93
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:29,990
Yes.

94
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,170
Four people have already watched it... and died.

95
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,020
That's simply not possible.

96
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,220
Mr. Andou?

97
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,670
Yes?

98
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:03,140
Dr. Takayama was... different from other people.  
You know that, don't you?

99
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:12,200
Yeah.  He'd talk about things that would happen 
in the future, or what other people were thinking, 
and would be right on the mark.  It was amazing.

100
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,930
You mean that?

101
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:29,820
He knew, didn't he?  That you and I would meet like this.

102
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:40,900
Why? Why did he die and leave me alone?

103
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,670
This is stupid.

104
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,590
Professor?

105
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,290
Professor?

106
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,070
Professor?

107
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,800
Professor?

108
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,130
Professor!

109
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,740
Hey! What'd you find out?

110
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,790
Myocardial infarcation caused by a tumor.

111
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,510
A tumor?

112
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,690
Take a look at this.

113
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,700
But... this isn't malignant.

114
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:34,610
There's no WAY something like this could just 
spring up in his blood vessels all of a sudden!

115
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,320
Was there anything that WASN'T strange about the 
guy?! Typical Takayama, eh?

116
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,580
What about the tumor in his throat?

117
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,440
Oh yeah. I couldn't find anything like it.

118
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,480
I did some asking around, and some famous 
professor at Bunka Medical University sent me his own opinion.

119
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,400
He says it looks just like a smallpox tumor.

120
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,130
There's no way.

121
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,380
The smallpox virus was eradicated ages ago.

122
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,230
What about Takayama's girlfriend? Did she say anything 
that'd give us a clue as to the cause of death?

123
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,340
She told me something a lot crazier than a virus.

124
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,730
You best tell me.

125
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,120
Hold on to yourself. She said he died from a videotape.

126
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,400
A videotape?!

127
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,400
Yeah.

128
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,180
What does that mean?

129
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,630
It seems there's a videotape that kills whoever watches it. 
That kind of tape exists, or so she said.

130
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,450
Meaning THAT's the tape that Asakawa Reiko took 
before she went missing?

131
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,880
Yes, he's here.

132
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,850
Me?

133
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,250
It's the police. They found Asakawa Reiko and her son.

134
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,740
They were in an automobile accident.

135
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:11,110
They already towed the other car away. Luckily, the 
driver came away with only minor injuries.

136
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,850
Hey, doctor!

137
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,750
The car was pretty badly damaged. We were just 
now able to remove the bodies.

138
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,690
The child, too?

139
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,200
Yes.

140
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:41,130
It looks like she'd gone back to her parents' house after all. 
Though they'd denied any knowledge of her
 whereabouts when we contacted them...

141
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:50,250
But there's something a little strange. It's possible that 
the child was already dead BEFORE the accident.

142
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,250
What?

143
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,630
Hey! What are you doing! You can't just walk right up there!

144
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,760
Sorry.

145
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,690
I'm from the media. I was Asakawa's senior co-worker.

146
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,620
Her co-oworker?

147
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,110
Officer... isn't that a VCR?

148
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,590
VCR?

149
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,750
Welcome home!

150
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,070
What're you doing just standing over there?

151
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,160
You're late.

152
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,300
Yeah...

153
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,130
Where's Takanori?

154
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,560
He went to sleep already. He said he was 
going to stay up 'til you got home, but...

155
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,860
Oh.

156
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,060
I'm just gonna check on him.

157
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,030
Don't wake him up.

158
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,670
I know.

159
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,650
I'm sorry. I woke you up.

160
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,820
What is it?

161
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,730
The child died, too?

162
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,180
Yes.

163
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,930
Yeah, but he didn't die because of the accident.

164
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:22,700
He was already dead.  Heart attack.

165
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:38,960
The police think that Asakawa Reiko was driving when 
she noticed that her son sitting in the back seat was dead. 
She took her attention from the road and that's 
what caused the accident.

166
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:49,910
Now Takayama, Asakawa Reiko, and even their son are dead.

167
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,580
Their son saw the video too, didn't he?

168
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,260
This has nothing to do with a video.

169
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,250
We know what exactly what caused his death.

170
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,780
And no matter how hard you look, you're not going 
to find any connection between dying because you 
watched some video, and a tumor in a person's arteries.

171
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,380
Isn't that right?

172
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:21,980
Dr. Takayama's talked to me about his son.

173
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,410
What did he say?

174
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:30,570
He said he regretted leaving any trace of his DNA in this world.

175
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:35,640
He regretted... leaving his DNA in this world?

176
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,720
Yes.

177
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,540
There isn't a father in this world that'd wish for the death of his son.

178
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,160
Mr. Andou.

179
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,170
What?

180
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:55,250
Dr. Takayama didn't want his son to die.

181
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,550
He was trying to HELP him.  For Ms. Asakawa's sake.

182
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,780
He was looking for a way to help them.

183
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,370
But something happened when he died.

184
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,030
He... saw something.

185
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:40,430
As for what he saw... I just don't know yet.

186
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,040
Mr. Kou, can you take a look at this?

187
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,810
That mouse is glowing!

188
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:23,170
Yes.  The fertilized egg of a mouse was injected 
with the genetic protein of a luminescent jellyfish.

189
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,030
It's for a classt.

190
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:33,070
You mean that "gene splicing" stuff? So it's already 
progressed this far...  That's amazing.

191
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,790
I bet if you put your minds to it you could even "make" a human, huh?

192
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:47,530
Sorry.

193
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,670
Do you remember me?

194
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:50,450
Yes.

195
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,710
I'm Yoshino from NNB Broadcasting.

196
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,370
Is there something I can help you with?

197
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:02,150
As a matter of fact, there's something I'd very 
much like for you to see.

198
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,760
What's that?

199
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,140
This is a record of what Asakawa Reiko was working on.

200
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,900
Record?

201
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,250
Yes.  She wrote about a videotape.

202
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,040
A videotape that kills you if you watch it.

203
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,920
Four people died of a heart attack at exactly the same time.

204
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:41,650
I now know that one week earlier, the four of them 
had watched a videotape at a lodge in Izu.

205
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,860
Asakawa was curious.  She went to Izu and found 
the videotape for herself.

206
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,760
She watched it, and was sure that she too would 
die one week later.

207
00:31:54,810 --> 00:32:00,960
Thus, aided by Takayama Ryuji, she began her investigations, 
trying to uncover everything she could about the videotape.

208
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:09,820
I don't know why... but even Asakawa's son saw the video.

209
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:18,050
From her information, the videotape was created by a girl 
named Yamamura Sadako, via her powers of psychography.

210
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:24,880
Sadako's mother, Yamamura Shizuko, was reportedly clairvoyant, 
which had the press all up in arms.

211
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,680
She was branded a fraund, a charlatan, and ended up 
committing suicide.

212
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:38,550
But as it turns out, her daughter Sadako was even more powerful. 
She had a miserable life, was treated like some sort of monster.

213
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:46,760
Sadako was killed by her father.  Her own father.

214
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:56,860
Sadako had the power to lay a curse on someone, 
and to kill them with it.  Through the power of her hatred.

215
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,850
Do you really believe that story?

216
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:17,890
Let me tell you about Asakawa. She thought whoever watched 
that video had to copy that tape and show it to someone else 
within seven days.  If they wanted to live.

217
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:27,050
So to save her child, she went to her parent's house 
and showed it to her father.  She even brought a VCR 
so she could copy the tape.

218
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:32,360
But one week later, her son died of a heart attack.

219
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:40,000
One week later... And what happened to her father?

220
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,340
He killed himself.

221
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,780
He'd written will. It said:

222
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:52,260
"Don't worry.  The tape is my responsibility, and I've taken care of it.

223
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,840
This is Yamamura Sadako.

224
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:12,730
She was in a small acting troupe for a while, in Tokyo. 
when she lived in Tokyo. This photograph is from around that time.

225
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,470
There's one more thing.

226
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,120
This was found at the Asakawa house. It's a copy of the tape.

227
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,950
I pass it on to you.

228
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,570
Please, feel free to watch it if you like.

229
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,200
Is something wrong?

230
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,310
Have you watched it?

231
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,540
No.

232
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:30,250
What's weird is weird, even if you don't actually believe in it.

233
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,280
That's the kind of thing this video is. Don't you think?

234
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,660
But you're a doctor. I need some kind of scientific basis 
for what's happened. Please, help me.

235
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:55,100
If you find out anything, please give me a call.  
I'm counting on you.

236
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,780
Present?

237
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,750
Present...

238
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,730
You're saying that this is a present?  From you to me?

239
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,200
Sadako!

240
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,560
Sadako!

241
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,570
Sadako!

242
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,060
Forgive me Sadako.

243
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:43,790
You were were never meant to be born into this world. Sadako!

244
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,930
Sadako!

245
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,210
I didn't come to you for help thinking you'd ask me 
to do something like THIS!

246
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:30,770
I'm a REPORTER. If I told a story like that, there'd be 
no difference between the nightly news and those 
"That's Incredible!" variety shows.

247
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,630
That's WHY I am telling you this. You can't report this 
to the public at all.

248
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:40,350
What ARE you talking about?  Why do you think I've gone 
through all this trouble to research Yamamura Sadako's story?

249
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:46,490
That video... it's the embodiment of Sadako's hatred. 
Make no mistake-- if you watch it, you will die.

250
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,480
You are NOT right in the head. Do you realize what you're saying?

251
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,870
Why don't you watch it for yourself? Then you'll realize 
whether what I'm saying is true or not.

252
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,440
I'm not discussing this any longer. Please leave. If you'll excuse me.

253
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,230
Wait a minute!

254
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,290
What's your problem?

255
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,120
Please give me the videotape.

256
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,040
I gave it to you already.

257
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:08,810
I want YOUR copy so I can get rid ot it. 
I want to get rid of all the videotapes, and then I want to die.

258
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,250
You wanna die...? Video...

259
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,280
Give it to me!

260
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,580
You think I'd just hand it over to you?  Get the fuck away from me!

261
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,970
Now wait just a minute! Give me that tape!

262
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:31,480
We are through talking.  Will you please let go of me?!

263
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,970
You just don't get it, do you?

264
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,480
What are you THINKING about over there?

265
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,000
Say something, dammit.

266
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,440
You look even more depressed than usual.  
Lke you you're about to die or something.

267
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,490
Yeah...

268
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:25,060
You want me to inject you with some of that protein 
from the glowing jellyfish? If I did that, it might "brighten" you up a little, huh?

269
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,410
Laugh, why don't you?

270
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:44,350
The bodies of four students have turned up. 
They all died from the same medical condition.

271
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:54,350
The administrative autopsy was carried out in Yokohama. 
All of them died from heart attack. 
What's more, the cause of the attacks was a tumor in their bloodstream.

272
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,610
Oh...

273
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,480
This may end up being a virus, after all.

274
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,200
A virus.

275
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:12,240
But I don't get it.  If it IS a virus, why didn't Asakawa 
Reiko also die from a heart attack?

276
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,500
Because the cause of death isn't a virus.

277
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,140
What is it, then?

278
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:19,970
A curse.

279
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,460
Gimme a break.

280
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:28,030
I have to apologize to you. The video DOES exist.

281
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,130
And I understand now what Takayama wants.

282
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,320
What Dr. Takayama wants?

283
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:46,030
I know what he wants me to do.

284
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:49,720
What's that?

285
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,660
To wipe that video off the face of this world.

286
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:04,360
Right before he died, he "saw" that things would turn out like this.

287
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:13,390
He thought that he could use me to stop 
Yamamura Sadako from carrying out her plan.

288
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:21,080
He's trying to get me destroy that video in 
exchange for granting my wish.

289
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:28,750
And what is your wish Mr. Andou?

290
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,020
What is it?

291
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:45,780
Takayama gave that video to me.  
As as a present.

292
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:52,800
Did you watch it?

293
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:01,190
Why?

294
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:19,170
You're wrong.

295
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,010
About what?

296
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,030
That's not what Dr. Takayama wanted.

297
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:44,910
It's the video. What else could it be?

298
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,210
He wants me to destroy the video. 
It's the only possible explanation.

299
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,430
Dr. Andou.

300
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,940
You have a  phone call, from a reporter named Mr. Yoshino.

301
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,390
HE got in touch with me.

302
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:44,980
It's open.

303
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,340
There's something I want to ask you.

304
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:57,840
Something you want to ask?

305
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:04,670
Well, what?

306
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:12,730
The well that Sadako fell into... by chance, 
is there a chunk missing out of one side?

307
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,280
You watched the video?

308
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,070
No I didn't watch it.  I have no reason to watch it.

309
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,220
Then how do you know?  
Asakawa Reiko didn't write about that in her notes.

310
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,930
I've had enough. To hell with this, all of it.

311
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:43,830
I'm giving you the video. Here, take this too. 
Now hurry up and get out.

312
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,290
You watched the video, didn't you?

313
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:48,880
No, I said! I haven't watched it.

314
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:01,610
Yamamura Sadako appears in my dreams.

315
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:03,900
I can't sleep.

316
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:06,710
Because I keepthose things on me.

317
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,910
I just want to hurry up and forget all about this. Please leave!

318
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:17,130
Mr. Yoshino? Mr. Yoshino?

319
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,350
Hey! Mr. Yoshino?

320
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,850
Mr. Andou?

321
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,690
Don't look. Let's go.

322
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,060
That's it

323
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,640
It's over now.

324
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:05,470
I'm a pathologist.  
Up 'til now, all I've had to do was slice up bodies.

325
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:12,100
But now I've helped save a few lives.

326
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,220
No, more than that. Tens, maybe hundreds of lives.

327
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:22,680
I've put an end to Yamamura Sadako's hatred.

328
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:36,490
I'm this video's last victim.

329
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,660
I'm so sorry, Mr. Andou.

330
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:27,670
You lost what's most important to you.

331
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,270
You've thought about dying many times over.

332
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:48,640
All this time, you've blamed yourself for letting your son die.

333
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:04,370
But being afraid to die is nothing to be ashamed of.

334
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,750
Nor is regretting that you watched the video.

335
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,060
How do you know that?

336
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,730
That I let my son die?

337
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:33,380
If I touch someone like this, 
I know what that person is thinking. Just a little.

338
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,270
You have a power... like Takayama's?

339
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:58,040
He was the only person that I could be with.

340
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:12,770
Dr. Takayama was the only one that ever understood me.

341
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,500
So I guess I can't lie to you.

342
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,530
I'm an idiot.

343
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,680
It's just like you said.

344
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,090
I just don't get it unless it's staring me in the face:

345
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:03,940
I'm scared of dying.

346
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:08,260
Please help me.

347
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,080
I don't want to die.

348
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,900
Why did I watch that video?

349
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:28,170
Why did Takayama make me do that?

350
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:47,500
Isn't it painful? Knowing how I feel?

351
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,410
There were times when I thought it was just an excuse.

352
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:31,160
When he said he regretted bringing a child in this world.

353
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,750
But he meant it.

354
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:45,320
Takayama had the ability to see the future, 
so why did he die the way he did?

355
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,940
Nobody knows what's going to happen to them.

356
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:55,250
Not Dr. Takayama.  Not me.

357
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:00,800
No one knows.

358
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:16,180
Listen.  I want you do to something for me.

359
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:22,670
Will you be with me until I die?

360
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:43,700
I'm sorry.

361
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:48,810
There's nothing to be sorry about.

362
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:56,470
I finally found it.

363
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:00,870
It's structurally different from the smallpox virus.

364
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,300
Never seen anything like it, have you?

365
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,220
So there WAS a virus?

366
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:09,730
It can't be...

367
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:16,600
That reporter, Mr. Yoshino-- he didn't die of a heart attack.

368
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:19,100
What?

369
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:23,580
He asphyxiated. I'm in the process of getting a sample.

370
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,120
I think he'll turn up symptoms of the virus as well.

371
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:30,440
His cause of death was different...

372
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,010
What does that mean?

373
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:41,230
What is it?

374
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,050
There's something I want to show you.

375
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:59,460
You're saying that watching a videotape can cause 
a virus to just spontaneously occur inside the body?

376
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:13,920
Well, it's interesting! The retinas take in genetic data
that's encoded on the tape, kinda like how computers 
use optical communication to send and receive 
information.  The data is then restructured inside the body, 
creating a virus.

377
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:18,790
Optical communication? That could be it!

378
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:21,180
You're talking the impossible, Andou. Think a moment.

379
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:25,970
If that's the case then why didn't Asakawa Reiko 
have the virus? She saw the video too, didn't she?

380
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,810
You're not making a whole lot of sense.

381
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:38,380
Yamamura Sadako? A girl who could kill people 
with a curse but fell into a well and died?

382
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:46,260
Who could believe a story like that?  
Listen, what killed those people was a virus 
with an unusually low contagion ability. 
Not some curse.

383
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:50,060
I thought so, too.

384
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,040
Until I watched the video for myself.

385
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:59,380
Until you watched the video?

386
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:04,760
You want to try taking a sample from my body?

387
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,770
Shut the fuck up.

388
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:13,550
Listen to me. when I watched the video, 
Sadako's memories entered my body.

389
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:14,470
I'm tellin' you, leave me the hell alone.

390
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:18,570
I saw a hospital in the woods. In Izu.  
That's where Sadako was killed... about 30 years ago.

391
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:27,880
Now you talk a hospital in Izu from around that timeframe, 
what does that make you think of?

392
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:31,690
Tuberculosis?

393
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,040
And something else.

394
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:38,630
And...

395
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:42,680
Smallpox.

396
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,720
Smallpox.

397
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,350
Mai!

398
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:56,420
Mai!

399
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,680
Shit!  Where the hell did she go?

400
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:49,430
So how does it feel knowing you won't be dying anytime soon?

401
01:09:56,580 --> 01:10:00,580
I have some good news. 
Your body turns up no traces of the virus.

402
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:04,930
Which would mean the virus has nothing to do with the video.  
Wouldn't you agree?

403
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:13,250
Take a look. 
It's a picture of the virus they took from Yoshino's neck.

404
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,380
There's a virus with a completely different structure 
mixed in with the others.

405
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,270
It's mutated. That's why his cause of death was different, too.

406
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:29,940
We are lucky that it has such a low chance of contagion. 
I have to study this virus in more detail, find out how it works. 
This might turn out to be a profound discovery.

407
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:43,130
Yeah... did something happen between you and Takano Mai?

408
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:45,860
What?

409
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:55,230
Don't worry. She'll turn up soon enough.

410
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:14,970
They're saying that the family wants to talk to you 
about how to proceed with the death certificate.

411
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:16,150
This is about the insurance, isn't it?

412
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:17,480
Probably.

413
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:21,760
Doctor?

414
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:23,350
I'll catch up with you later.

415
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:02,920
You smell like a dead body.

416
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,030
Mr. Maekawa!

417
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:00,680
We've been cursed.

418
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:04,970
I have never had a case like this before.

419
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:06,510
Wait a minute.

420
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,420
It can't be.

421
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,370
They appear to have found evidence indicating that she gave birth.

422
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:52,610
Gave birth?

423
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,280
Yes.

424
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:02,790
But we can't find the baby's corpse anywhere.

425
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:11,870
The building's air vent... it looked just like a well.

426
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,700
Miyashita?

427
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:51,150
Hey, Andou...

428
01:15:56,550 --> 01:16:02,530
Yamamura Sadako's well... 
does it by chance have a chunk missing out of one side?

429
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:32,960
Miyashita...

430
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:44,150
Yoshino didn't watch that video after all... 
but he still got infected with the virus.

431
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:46,980
Why do you think that is?

432
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:54,010
It's Asakawa Reiko's notebook.

433
01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:58,220
It's the only possible explanation.

434
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:01,010
I can see it.

435
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:07,780
The color of the well, the way it looks. 
I see it in my dreams.  It's like I'm actually there.

436
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:13,240
All I did was read that notebook, 
but I can see the images in my head so clearly.

437
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:19,490
You're saying the virus is generated not just by the video, 
but by WRITING?

438
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:26,500
But that doesn't mean that EVERYONE dies.
There's a way to save yourself.

439
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,540
A way to save yourself?

440
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:34,190
Asakawa left her own record behind.
Just reading it is enough to infect the reader with the virus.

441
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:38,040
In other words, she aided the virus in its proliferation.

442
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,700
The virus'... proliferation?

443
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,230
She became Yamamura Sadako's HELPER.

444
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:52,710
Andou, tell me. What did you do?

445
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:55,750
I...

446
01:17:55,900 --> 01:18:00,890
You're the only survivor. What did you do? Why did you survive!?

447
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,070
I am NOT Yamamura Sadako's helper!

448
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:08,910
Liar!

449
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:17,390
I didn't help spread the virus!

450
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:18,420
Come on, tell me!

451
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,130
I didn't do anything!

452
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,980
Give me back that notebook.

453
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,730
It's mine.

454
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:58,310
Give it back!

455
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:01,510
I understand how I was reborn into this world!

456
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:07,510
I put my own genetic information onto the 
videotape using nensha,or psychography.  
That information went from your body into Mai's. 
cursed the videotape, you saw it.

457
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,670
Into Mai's womb.

458
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:25,350
Because you were so kind to sleep with her, 
I was able to be reborn.

459
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:26,630
Bitch!

460
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:30,830
Why did you have to kill Mai?

461
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:37,630
Mai isn't dead. She's still alive...inside of me.

462
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:42,460
All of Mai's memories are inside of me.

463
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:53,260
You are Sadako.  Not Mai.

464
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:01,780
I'm Mai.

465
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:03,700
Liar!

466
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:20,410
Mr. Andou.  You didn't sleep with me because you loved me.

467
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:29,530
You were just scared of dying.  And lonely.

468
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:35,800
I wanted to help you.

469
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:42,720
But it's not like you loved me or anything.

470
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:48,640
What the hell do you know?

471
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:01,270
You were happy, weren't you?  
Because you felt a sense of superiority over Mr. Takayama?

472
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,610
No!

473
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:15,770
You used Mai AND me to come back to this world. 
You killed Mai!

474
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:24,010
It was all your fault. Because you slept with me.

475
01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:34,670
Mai.  Forgive me, Mai.

476
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:46,380
I forgive you Mr. Andou.

477
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,110
I forgive you.

478
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:00,520
What the hell are you after?

479
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:04,770
Takayama, Asakawa Reiko, Mai... they're all dead.

480
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,250
What do you want? Why did all this happen?

481
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:13,530
Nobody knows what's going to happen to them.

482
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:23,000
But I wanted everyone to know.

483
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:25,020
Know what?

484
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:29,200
To know the fear that I'd felt for so long.

485
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:31,200
Fear?

486
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:36,040
Yes. Fear.

487
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:11,840
I have more that I want you to do. You are my assistant.

488
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,840
Stop it, please!  Sadako!

489
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:17,950
No.  No.  I was only carrying out Takayama's will.  
That's why I smashed the video.

490
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,680
I told you, didn't I?  That's not what he wanted.

491
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:28,050
Meeting him was what allowed me to come back.

492
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:34,150
That's why I was able to be reborn.

493
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,350
That's impossible.

494
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:47,200
Takayama wanted to STOP Sadako!

495
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:50,750
Right?!

496
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:58,230
So this time, I want to help HIM.

497
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,460
His DNA is still at the hospital.

498
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:06,380
We can do it if I use my womb...

499
01:24:06,890 --> 01:24:09,070
Ryjui wouldn't help you, and neither will I!

500
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:10,650
Oh, really?

501
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,670
No.  There's no way.

502
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:24,980
Look!

503
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,890
Do this for me, and I can grant YOUR wish too.

504
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:51,150
Andou!

505
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:20,220
Takayama!

506
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:33,800
Take the fertilized egg out of my body and inject it with the genetic data.

507
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,380
Then, return it to my womb.

508
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:54,020
The memories prior to death remain in the DNA itself. 
If you use one of my fertilized eggs, 
it should mature to the same age as when the person died 
within 2-3 weeks if you use hormones to 
quicken the rate of cellular division.

509
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,430
Once this is put back into Takano Mai's womb, we're all finished.

510
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:07,690
You look terrible.

511
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:11,360
You too.

512
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:14,110
We traitors, aren't we?

513
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:22,060
But who have we betrayed?  This world... or God Himself?

514
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:49,920
Daddy!

515
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:09,710
Takanori?

516
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:40,030
I missed you so much,  Takanori.

517
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,150
Daddy.

518
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:22,880
So?  What'd you think of my present?

519
01:28:24,610 --> 01:28:26,170
It was all thanks to that hair.

520
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:31,590
Take good care of him this time. He is my brother, after all.

521
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:40,770
So Mai's wish... and my wish have been fulfilled.

522
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:54,890
The notebook that Asakawa left behind is going to be published. As a novel.

523
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:56,390
What?

524
01:28:57,910 --> 01:29:05,890
People will read it. And the fear that Sadako 
experienced will spread across this world.

525
01:29:07,610 --> 01:29:10,760
And the people who read it...
the virus will develop inside their bodies.

526
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:18,200
What will the world become because of the virus?

527
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,670
Sadako will born.

528
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:28,190
There will be more and more people like Sadako.

529
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:36,170
Reproduction will not be limited to the viral level-- 
it will spread through bodily contact as well.

530
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:42,450
After that, even I can't see. Perhaps...

531
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:43,690
Perhaps?

532
01:29:45,970 --> 01:29:50,020
This virus will cause a change in humanity itself.

533
01:29:52,540 --> 01:29:57,950
After all, humanity is the result of tiny organisms 
undergoing complicated changes, evolving into what we are now.

534
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:04,950
And now it's time for that evolution to proceed to the next level.

535
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:09,490
The world will change.

536
01:30:10,930 --> 01:30:15,830
We have been dragged inside that vortex of change.  
You, me, and...

537
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:24,700
What can you see? How will the future turn out? Tell me.

538
01:30:27,670 --> 01:30:31,130
Daddy! Come here!

539
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:43,470
Stay away from Takanori.

540
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:48,970
Even though I gave birth to him...

541
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:51,610
Just keep away.

542
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:53,620
Hey, Andou.

543
01:30:55,320 --> 01:31:00,240
You betrayed the world in order to get your kid back.  
Isn't that right?

544
01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:09,290
Let go of me.

545
01:31:24,910 --> 01:31:25,970
Goodbye.

546
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:34,100
I wonder what sort of life awaiting that child.

547
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:47,140
Takayama, don't want your own child back?

548
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:48,490
We still have his cells.

549
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:53,810
You could do it if you wanted. Right?

550
01:31:58,230 --> 01:32:00,370
I couldn't do such a terrible thing.

551
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:09,150
I couldn't bring a child back into this world.

552
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,410
No.

553
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:18,940
You're wrong.

554
01:32:21,490 --> 01:32:31,070
Andou... it will be a long, long time before there is peace again in this world.

555
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:39,760
Take care.
