No, you're wrong.
-I'm not mistaken.

186
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:04,341
... to understand that you should
that everyone follow the rules ...

187
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:12,082
There was plenty of water in the lungs,
if it were unflati as ... a balloon

188
00:15:12,082 --> 00:15:14,617
to form a liquid aqueous foam

189
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:16,853
that could have him drowning.

190
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:21,157
however, suffered
and a massive heart attack.

191
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,892

the cardinal chest
presents numerous ...

193
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:27,497
cardinals?

194
00:15:27,797 --> 00:15:30,199
I had to struggle
to remove water from there.

195
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:34,036
... probably remained under water
under two hours.

196
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:36,305

Accused of Use
abuse of state property.

207
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:41,535
Remember that Hitler intervened
personal favor.

208
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,373
Well ... it's great, right?

209
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,076
A Big Boss of the party died.

210
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,079

Heil Hitler.

224
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:56,348

The other ...! Dismissed!

231
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:33,651
I remember your mother
we went to school together.

232
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,419
You like gym?

233
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,690
It's part of my education.

234
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,959

00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:51,134
All follow our parents.

238
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:56,206
tried to do
all our best.

239
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,410
I read your statement about the incident.

240
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:01,911
You've been very helpful.

241
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:04,781
Relax.

242
00:22:05,014 --> 00:22:10,019
One thing you could not see trupull
tell where you were.

243
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:13,122
I checked.
So I wonder ...

244
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:18,027
What you see ...
Why did you stop?

245
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:25,567
A car ...

246
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,904
and three men.

247
00:22:30,772 --> 00:22:33,308
Nothing?
Nothing.

248
00:22:33,742 --> 00:22:35,510
Then why are you afraid?

249
00:22:36,745 --> 00:22:38,747
Do you recognize anyone?

250
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:40,615
Tell me.

251
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,318
You'll feel better.

252
00:22:46,454 --> 00:22:49,624
At the beginning of the course,
there came a special guest.

253
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:54,128
We spoke to the organization
police forces in the Reich.

254
00:22:54,729 --> 00:22:56,898
I was in the guard of honor.

255
00:22:58,065 --> 00:22:59,567
I was close to him.

256
00:23:00,668 --> 00:23:04,438
It was the lake. Sure.

257
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,643
Tell me ... who was it?

258
00:23:10,377 --> 00:23:12,947
It was a general commander of the Gestapo.

259
00:23:16,517 --> 00:23:18,285
Globus?

260
00:23:22,489 --> 00:23:24,391
Can you keep a secret?

261
00:23:26,126 --> 00:23:27,427
Okay.

Heil Hitler.
-Yes.

266
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:07,757
I want to see him Herr Stuckhart.

267
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:22,071
Are you American?
-Right.

268
00:25:22,872 --> 00:25:24,273
Are you here on business?

269
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:28,111
Herr Stuckhart?

270
00:25:30,713 --> 00:25:32,481

00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:34,917
apartment 7.

272
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:38,354

00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:49,714
Well, do not worry.
-Thank you.

278
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:09,600
Good news.

279
00:28:11,969 --> 00:28:14,938
The meeting between Kennedy and Hitler.

280
00:28:26,116 --> 00:28:27,984
General Nebe,
he wants to see me?.

281
00:28:28,318 --> 00:28:30,987

Xavier ... come.

284
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:43,900
Next year this time
you could be on vacation in Miami Beach ...

285
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,502
Or in California
-With my salary I doubt.

286
00:28:47,336 --> 00:28:48,504
We need Americans.

287
00:28:49,572 --> 00:28:53,242
Without their cooperation, war
Russia could continue for years.

288
00:28:53,676 --> 00:28:55,945
I thought we progress

289
00:28:57,246 --> 00:29:00,916
Like last year, or the previous one?
Close it.

290
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:09,825
This is my oldest grandson.

291
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:18,433
... a very nice boy.

292
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:19,601
How is your son?

293
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:23,204
It's okay.
Thanks.

294
00:29:24,072 --> 00:29:26,474
I wish I had more with me.

295
00:29:28,443 --> 00:29:32,313
-Are you involved in the case Bühler
-Yes, sir.

296
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:38,219
You're not, the case was reviewed
as a matter of state security.

297
00:29:39,887 --> 00:29:43,524
Gestapo handle the investigation.

298
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:48,496
police file should be closed immediately.

299
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:54,034
We have a witness who saw the General Globus
the place where it was found ...

300
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:57,704
... body of Bühler, sir.

00:29:57,938 --> 00:30:00,140
-Globus
-Yes, sir.

302
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,609
Really?
-Chief of the Gestapo.

303
00:30:03,977 --> 00:30:10,817
Stuckhart Walther was found this morning
shot near a prostitute.

304
00:30:10,884 --> 00:30:14,087
Stuckhart

00:30:14,087 --> 00:30:18,491

about the racial issue.

306
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:22,428
He retired 3 years ago
Interior Ministry.

307
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:28,401
I think we should be ...
something good about the Gestapo.

308
00:30:28,835 --> 00:30:32,471
Not if Stuckhart, not yet.

309
00:30:33,272 --> 00:30:37,176
Why do not you dig a little more?

310
00:30:41,247 --> 00:30:44,583
We got about
in case Stuckhart?

311
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:50,656
We have an American,
who discovered the body.

312
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:52,291
One of the journalists who visit us.

313
00:30:52,524 --> 00:30:53,659
He had a meeting with him.

314
00:30:54,693 --> 00:30:56,328
was arrested for talking to her.

315
00:30:58,463 --> 00:31:01,099
Find out who intend
to do Globus.

316
00:31:01,766 --> 00:31:06,104
Just writing
inform me directly.

317
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:08,640
Yes, sir.

318
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,512
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

319
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:16,981
Xavier March, will not last long.

320
00:31:18,716 --> 00:31:22,787
You said the statement from
to take an interview of Mr. Stuckhart.

321
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,324
Yeah, he was a founding member
the party and ...

322
00:31:27,324 --> 00:31:32,296
... my editor wanted his reaction
about Kennedy-Hitler meeting.

323
00:31:34,164 --> 00:31:38,202
The Cold War is over.
Is not it wonderful?

324
00:31:40,404 --> 00:31:44,007
Of course.
And that was at 10:45?

325
00:31:46,543 --> 00:31:47,711
All right.

326
00:31:50,881 --> 00:31:54,117
Can I go now, sir?
-No, not yet.

327
00:31:54,718 --> 00:31:55,819
Follow me please.

328
00:31:59,822 --> 00:32:03,293
Can anyone tell me when
I regain my passport?

329
00:32:04,594 --> 00:32:06,696
But we need him.

330
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:15,571
Have you ever been to Germany?
-Not since I was a girl.

331
00:32:17,706 --> 00:32:19,875
A carefully rebuilt building.

332
00:32:22,378 --> 00:32:23,912
Are you from New York?

333
00:32:25,981 --> 00:32:29,218
Xavier was often in New York
during the war, rightly Xavier?

334
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:31,887
The periscope, hunting convoys of ships.

335
00:32:32,721 --> 00:32:37,092
Yeah, well, the war ended.
Now we are allies.

336
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:43,865
Sure, but we know how they died so?
-Raid vosru killed 100,000 in Dresden.

337
00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:47,202
You were ready to throw
atomic bomb over England.

338
00:32:47,435 --> 00:32:51,239
-You threw it in Japan twice.
-But I struggled to survive.

339
00:32:51,272 --> 00:32:53,041
So are we.

340
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,048
Oh ... Beautiful.

341
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:06,020
It's for my son.
We go on a cruise together.

342
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,189
On Lake Entiegarden.

343
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:20,467
Young cadet, Jost.

344
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:23,236
You give the cusotodie for protection.

345
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:27,140
Discreet. Understood.

346
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:32,545
If you decide to stay there
Xavier, I will cover.

347
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,797
Heil Hitler.

348
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:59,672
We must see
Mr. Stuckhart apartment.

349
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,641
But Gestapo
in sealed, Major.

350
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,677
I know, but you should see it.

351
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:08,580
left precise instructions
that nobody should see it.

352
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:10,249
key, please.

353
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:15,687
Excuse me.

354
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,290
Herr Stuckart live alone?

355
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:24,062
Herr Stuckart was very discreet,
but he was never alone.

356
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:24,996
Right this way.

357
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,235
-workers more here?
-I'm night porter.

358
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,671
For 9 years.
Who is the day?

359
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,241
Nobody.

360
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,577
Heil Hitler.

361
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:48,352
He was a morning in the lobby.
-You did not say anything about it in the declaration.

362
00:34:48,452 --> 00:34:51,188
I gave important.
I thought was goalkeeper.

363
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:04,234
Why did you bring me here?
-I wanted to talk to you.

364
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:08,505
You brought me here just to talk?
-In particular.

365
00:35:21,884 --> 00:35:23,953
You lied to the police station
Why?

366
00:35:25,021 --> 00:35:28,925
I did not lie to the police.
Why should you see this man?

367
00:35:30,526 --> 00:35:32,228
I told you.

368
00:35:33,963 --> 00:35:37,299
I wanted to talk about
Kennedy meeting Hitler.

369
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:39,101
Everything is my statement.

370
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,073
You came at 10:45.

371
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,776
The meeting was announced at
11:30, in a press conference.

372
00:35:49,211 --> 00:35:51,346
You could not know about it.

373
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:02,324
I gotta go.
Come!

374
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:06,227
the stairs quickly.

375
00:36:08,897 --> 00:36:09,797
Wait.

376
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:15,503
Right this way.
Take the second elevator.

377
00:36:17,572 --> 00:36:20,241
Please to behave naturally.

378
00:36:50,837 --> 00:36:54,507
What are you doing here?
I sealed apartment.

379
00:36:55,475 --> 00:37:00,113
SS officer and I do my duty.

380
00:37:05,284 --> 00:37:09,589
Where is American and what is he doing here?

381
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:14,226
It was a long day, I'm sorry.

382
00:37:16,762 --> 00:37:22,501
By the way, double parked,
you could be fined.

383
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:31,677
May swim in deep water.

384
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:37,582
Heil Hitler.

385
00:37:44,823 --> 00:37:46,357
Thank you.

386
00:38:02,473 --> 00:38:07,211
Yeah?
-You can see almost everything here?

387
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:16,453
What do you want, Globus
I want to expand your horizons.

388
00:38:18,822 --> 00:38:20,090
We need to talk.

389
00:38:25,495 --> 00:38:26,463
Heil Hitler.

390
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,896
Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, Xavier.

391
00:39:01,196 --> 00:39:04,967
Gestapo win.
I'll show you what I missed.

392
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,235
That explains everything

393
00:39:41,702 --> 00:39:43,804
Shut the door.

394
00:39:45,706 --> 00:39:55,949
That's Kaiser Ferdinand III, Devois.
Ian Christian Hagenberg, Heydrich ...

395
00:39:55,949 --> 00:40:03,824
Schwarzenberg Otto Hans Felange.
And about 35 known paintings.

396
00:40:05,826 --> 00:40:09,095
I imagine the Bühler
sitting here with the door closed

397
00:40:09,596 --> 00:40:12,265
Like a dirty old man in a brothel.

398
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:17,670
They're all wonderful paintings, sir
-Ca Secretary of State in Poland ...

399
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:22,475
Bühler had access to everything sent
Stuckart Ministry of Interior.

400
00:40:22,408 --> 00:40:26,913
His humanity now looking Globus
Franz Luther from the Foreign Office.

401
00:40:26,913 --> 00:40:29,916
His position gave him the opportunity
to travel abroad

402
00:40:30,016 --> 00:40:33,019
once or twice a year
until last week.

403
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:36,789
smuggle artwork in Switzerland ...

404
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:42,361
except small collection of Bühler.

405
00:40:42,595 --> 00:40:46,865
Last week at a time,
the three and realized that the Gestapo ...

406
00:40:46,865 --> 00:40:50,969
and circled the result,
two suicides, Bühler and Stuckart.

407
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:57,509
No doubt the third, when Luther
realizes that there is no escape.

408
00:40:57,642 --> 00:40:59,811
I understand.

409
00:40:59,811 --> 00:41:02,180
The problem is
in the hands of the Gestapo.

410
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,617
In accordance with their own order
data Reich Minister, Heydrich.

411
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:10,054
Well, there is more to say.
-Yes, indeed.

412
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:14,392
I found prosthetic leg
Bühler's in his closet.

413
00:41:15,093 --> 00:41:20,932
And so I do not understand why it would be hopping
one foot to the lake ...

414
00:41:20,932 --> 00:41:23,000
... like suicide.

415
00:41:28,305 --> 00:41:31,475
This is an issue
state security

416
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:38,615
You have good prospects of promotion Xavier
If you forget this. You can go far.

417
00:41:39,483 --> 00:41:43,053
You can not afford to have it
the enemy on Globus ...

418
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:46,456
... or me.

419
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,628
Yes, sir.

420
00:42:18,854 --> 00:42:21,824
to eat something.

421
00:42:21,824 --> 00:42:23,092
I think it's time to go home.

422
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:31,533
Heil Hitler.
-Heinz Max.

423
00:42:35,237 --> 00:42:42,043
Let's drink warm.
I want a big cake.

424
00:42:42,577 --> 00:42:45,613
What do you think? "
I want a big cake.

425
00:42:45,613 --> 00:42:48,950
A big cake and a hot chocolate ...

426
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:07,501
You're under arrest.
-Please.

427
00:43:20,314 --> 00:43:22,049
You like?

428
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:30,657
Who is JC?.
I do not know.

429
00:43:30,657 --> 00:43:35,628
How did you get it?
-I was given ...

430
00:43:35,628 --> 00:43:39,666
... for loyal service
the homeland after the war.

431
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:48,808
-Who gave you?
-Navy commander, Doenitz ...

432
00:43:52,178 --> 00:44:00,019
You think it could be?
-For a while.

433
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:06,191
Could it be forever?
-Sure can.

434
00:44:17,035 --> 00:44:22,407
It's a cruelty to grow it, huh.
Why?.

435
00:44:24,509 --> 00:44:27,812
This is an incorrect position
and never recover.

436
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:35,853
What would you do?
-Well, I think you should kill him.

437
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:45,963
Who taught you this nonsense?
-Well, my teachers, my friends ...

438
00:44:45,963 --> 00:44:48,766
Even mother.

439
00:44:52,503 --> 00:44:56,607
Let me tell you a story
of a watchmaker.

440
00:44:58,775 --> 00:45:05,282
He was over a hundred years
wrinkles on the face, and snow-white hair.

441
00:45:07,584 --> 00:45:12,856
He spent his life
watch hunched over just like that.

442
00:45:14,157 --> 00:45:18,862
And, therefore, was a hunchback.

443
00:45:20,363 --> 00:45:24,767
People think it's ugly
villagers.

444
00:45:25,368 --> 00:45:32,642
And they said in different ways, so that it
he retired to his mountain among his watches.

445
00:45:32,675 --> 00:45:38,581
where he worked day and night,
and never stopped working ...

446
00:45:38,581 --> 00:45:45,954
not seen as humpback
grows more and more and more.

447
00:45:46,522 --> 00:45:56,164
One day, a walk was to fall
hump nose due.

448
00:45:58,133 --> 00:46:09,177
That same night,
while working in hours ...

449
00:46:09,177 --> 00:46:20,655
in the mirror he saw two birds
coming out her clothes.

450
00:46:20,688 --> 00:46:26,827
were white and grew,
and when he looked again ...

451
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:34,401
There were two large wings,
and all clocks began to sing.

452
00:46:35,335 --> 00:46:42,609
opened the window,
he looked at the stars, and flew into the sky.

453
00:46:43,877 --> 00:46:46,012
And what happened?

454
00:46:47,247 --> 00:46:50,350
It became angel.

455
00:46:52,252 --> 00:46:56,056
What happened?.
-Well ...

456
00:46:57,924 --> 00:47:00,493
We can not kill angels, right?

457
00:47:01,594 --> 00:47:02,829
No

458
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,069
It's time to go home.

459
00:47:22,615 --> 00:47:29,555
cadet issue, the case is closed.
It does not matter, because he's dead

460
00:47:32,257 --> 00:47:36,595
When?
-Last night

461
00:47:40,198 --> 00:47:45,270
-What?
-Do workout at the gym.

462
00:47:45,403 --> 00:47:47,605
He fell and broke his neck

463
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:52,110
I'm witnesses?
-No witnesses.

464
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:55,813
instructor said
that he loved gymnastics.

465
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:05,589
I want an autopsy.

466
00:48:08,325 --> 00:48:13,330
On the left temporal lobe
I found a small sign or bruises.

467
00:48:14,398 --> 00:48:19,069
On the right side of the chest,
in the arm are two broken ribs.

468
00:48:20,304 --> 00:48:24,908
There was a hemorrhage
the bottom of the column.

469
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:32,215
spine fracture and contusions
all consistent with a fall.

470
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:39,289
In my opinion, the cause of death
was inhalation of blood to the lungs.

471
00:48:40,023 --> 00:48:46,629
If you could have intervened in time, who knows,
it was possible to save him.

472
00:48:47,764 --> 00:48:52,234
Before the war, Joe Kennedy
supported peace with Germany.

473
00:48:52,501 --> 00:48:55,871
This initiative is an extension of
the old beliefs?

474
00:48:56,305 --> 00:49:00,910
Joe Kennedy, as private citizen
did not hesitate to express doubts about ...

475
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,446
U.S. involvement
in a European conflict.

476
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:10,285
Of course, when we were attacked we answer
and opinions of Kennedy and lost power.

477
00:49:10,285 --> 00:49:13,455
-This initiative is an effort
to stabilize relations ...

478
00:49:13,655 --> 00:49:16,691
Miss McGuire?
From the Reich tourist office.

479
00:49:16,691 --> 00:49:19,361
Good morning.
-Excuse me?

480
00:49:19,427 --> 00:49:23,698
Reichturism. Preparations ready
for your visit to the city.

481
00:49:24,632 --> 00:49:29,904
No, you must be a mistake.
-Yesterday I talked about the cruise.

482
00:49:34,676 --> 00:49:36,878
And what makes you think
I'm still interested?

483
00:49:39,013 --> 00:49:40,514
I think you are.

484
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:45,419
U.S. can not live in isolation ...

485
00:49:46,687 --> 00:49:51,358
Let's forget the past and build a future
peaceful world for all peoples.

486
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:52,050
-You want that?
-Both.

487
00:50:53,352 --> 00:50:55,387
I hope you enjoyed.
-Yes.

488
00:50:57,656 --> 00:50:58,924
Here.

489
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,529
Honey.
-You're late.

490
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:06,131
I know.
-Expectancy more ...

491
00:51:06,264 --> 00:51:08,666
I'm sorry, go ahead.

492
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:12,937
I could do anything, I had
more work. Thanks

493
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:02,318
Oh, here.
Welcome.

494
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:12,795
Reichturism?
What is this?

495
00:52:13,963 --> 00:52:18,534
I want to propose something,
I give you your passport back ...

496
00:52:18,534 --> 00:52:21,870
If you tell me your little secret.

497
00:52:23,772 --> 00:52:29,711
Why would I do that?
-You entered a delicate situation.

498
00:52:29,945 --> 00:52:33,181
You do not know this country.
-No, but I'm here.

499
00:52:33,849 --> 00:52:36,451
I know that there is material for an article.

500
00:52:36,918 --> 00:52:38,753
-It is a matter
state security.

501
00:52:38,887 --> 00:52:42,390
and Kennedy will meet Hitler,
I'll tell it.

502
00:52:44,092 --> 00:52:48,096
No, I have a proposal
very simple for you.

503
00:52:48,229 --> 00:52:51,566
I'll show you where we started
and we will go together on the line.

504
00:52:54,068 --> 00:52:58,906
Come on, you should not be here.

505
00:52:59,707 --> 00:53:03,611
The last night of the Gestapo were not you?
Disturbed.

506
00:53:04,712 --> 00:53:08,716
I could go to the Gestapo,
I could tell them our meetings

507
00:53:09,717 --> 00:53:10,885
I'm sure you will be interested.

508
00:53:11,018 --> 00:53:13,721
You have no idea what
you might happen, right?

509
00:53:20,727 --> 00:53:23,830
Okay. Behold.

510
00:53:31,805 --> 00:53:35,308
I gave it to a man at the hotel.
There had never seen him before.

511
00:53:37,877 --> 00:53:40,246
These figures do not say anything.

512
00:53:41,147 --> 00:53:43,816
I thought you were a cop.

513
00:53:44,117 --> 00:53:46,119
The building tells me.

514
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:08,307
The photo was more derelict.

515
00:54:10,442 --> 00:54:14,846
Hello, welcome to Wannsee.
Visit someone?

516
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,417
Yes, I'm here to ask some questions.

517
00:54:22,287 --> 00:54:26,658
You're a cop.
What is this place?

518
00:54:27,926 --> 00:54:30,428
Blind House.

519
00:54:38,603 --> 00:54:42,540
Hundreds of thousands died on the Russian front.

520
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,844
The people here are twenty years
their number is at least double.

521
00:54:49,046 --> 00:54:51,582
A hundred thousand, are you sure?
-Sure.

522
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:54,885
If you can not see, you must
be more blind than me.

523
00:54:56,086 --> 00:54:57,788
What unit are you?

524
00:54:57,788 --> 00:55:00,324
Good morning,
Major, miss.

They must ensure that embassy
Remove two people in the country.

01:03:42,762 --> 01:03:45,498
You'll need to prepare this document.

592
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:53,939
Nothing will ever be the same.

593
01:03:56,709 --> 01:03:58,811
Not for you, or anyone else.

594
01:04:10,689 --> 01:04:12,357

01:05:00,604 --> 01:05:01,538
Do not shoot.

601
01:05:26,062 --> 01:05:29,565
What are you doing here? Come with me.

602
01:05:31,367 --> 01:05:35,705
Why are not you on the plane?
-Called Luther, what do you do?

603
01:05:36,272 --> 01:05:39,408
I'll take you to the airport where

01:05:40,176 --> 01:05:41,877

Why was he killed?

01:05:41,877 --> 01:05:45,414
Why everyone is killed?
-Shut up once?

606
01:06:00,996 --> 01:06:02,530
Of course.

607
01:06:06,868 --> 01:06:11,239
See you later, bye.

608
01:06:15,943 --> 01:06:21,916
-Globus.
-I wanted alive.

609
01:06:25,086 --> 01:06:32,826
Luther, you would have to do
my people? To photograph ...

610
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:37,064
.. killing innocent people.
-I need him for questioning.

611
01:06:37,064 --> 01:06:40,767
Why? Was just a common criminal.

612
01:06:42,903 --> 01:06:49,643
Do not you?
A woman sitting next to him on the train.

613
01:06:51,411 --> 01:06:56,116
It was seen as he gave ... envelope

614
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:59,586
He was the one who was with March
Stuckhart's apartment.

615
01:07:00,019 --> 01:07:02,055
I really do not know.

616
01:07:03,523 --> 01:07:08,427
Why issued a March?
-Because there were no evidence against them.

617
01:07:09,629 --> 01:07:11,097
Evidence?

618
01:07:11,497 --> 01:07:17,002
times change, Globus.
It's time for relaxation.

619
01:07:19,171 --> 01:07:22,741
If something
that can help Gestapo ...

620
01:07:23,342 --> 01:07:26,178
Of course, we will announce.

621
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:35,053
Oh, yeah, I'll let you know.

622
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:51,102
What do we do?

623
01:07:51,436 --> 01:07:54,172
I will inform the embassy where you are.

624
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:56,607
What?

625
01:07:56,607 --> 01:08:00,311
I put under arrest.
Why?

626
01:08:00,344 --> 01:08:04,648
When you question
answer short and to the point.

627
01:08:05,516 --> 01:08:09,720
Which object?
-In truth, trying once.

628
01:08:11,121 --> 01:08:15,025
You'll be safe-guarded by the SS.
-Nonsense.

629
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:21,598
You're scared and if I teach you die.
'll Die anyway.

630
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:27,404
Luther killed thousands of people
to protect the biggest secret war.

631
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,811
Look, give me that.

632
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:38,281
He wanted to go to the U.S. embassy, ??
to issue documents for travel.

633
01:08:38,915 --> 01:08:40,550
Who is this woman?

634
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:48,090
Maybe it's his wife.

635
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:27,996
Well, that's it .. wife.

636
01:09:29,797 --> 01:09:34,369
Then who is it?
I do not know.

637
01:09:38,206 --> 01:09:39,073
between.

638
01:09:45,012 --> 01:09:46,180
Sit down.

639
01:09:50,017 --> 01:09:52,152
Thank you for coming.

640
01:09:52,953 --> 01:09:55,856
What did exactly
Major March to find out?

641
01:09:56,490 --> 01:10:03,230
You have to understand, he's a cop,
I tried to help him in the investigation ...

642
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:05,298
Of course, you tried to help him.

643
01:10:05,699 --> 01:10:12,272
So, when he came to my office ...
-Did you know that before you come?

644
01:10:12,806 --> 01:10:18,011
I knew something, not exactly.
-Not exactly.

645
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:28,955
But that wont sleep
with unknown man, you know?

646
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:40,466
Go with mother.

647
01:10:49,908 --> 01:10:51,276
Max Jäger?

648
01:10:53,412 --> 01:10:57,749
Yeah, what do you want?
-'re Looking at Xavier March.

649
01:10:59,618 --> 01:11:01,186
I do not know where it is.

650
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:19,604
Do you mind if we continue elsewhere?
-Of course not.

651
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:36,954
Good evening, Gunther.
-Good evening, Xavier.

652
01:11:38,322 --> 01:11:40,591
I want to remove a file for me.

653
01:11:40,891 --> 01:11:44,494
Now I agree to treat you
as a friend out of the car.

654
01:11:46,063 --> 01:11:49,799
I was thinking the sky
Internal Affairs ...

655
01:11:51,067 --> 01:11:54,070
to examine the records of crimes
from sexual crimes unit.

656
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:59,909
I think you will find that many are missing
photos, magazines, movies ...

657
01:11:59,909 --> 01:12:05,748
... a very interesting material,
including child pornography.

658
01:12:09,886 --> 01:12:12,421
What file do?
-Franz Luther.

659
01:12:12,421 --> 01:12:14,790
Luther? For God Xavier.
-Get him!

660
01:12:17,626 --> 01:12:19,261
I have tomorrow.

661
01:12:31,673 --> 01:12:36,244
happily married for 40 years ...

662
01:12:39,581 --> 01:12:43,752
... a romantic relationship
between '48 and '50.

663
01:12:43,885 --> 01:12:47,021
... that relationship is over
the pressure of von Ribbentrop.

664
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:54,762
See? Same woman.
-E Anna von Hagen, an actress.

665
01:12:55,196 --> 01:12:58,966
She waits for an American.
-Okay.

666
01:13:14,248 --> 01:13:17,885
Yeah?
-Anna von Hagen?

667
01:13:17,918 --> 01:13:21,655
Who is
-I sent Herr Luther.

668
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:25,225
You're from the American Embassy
-Yes.

669
01:13:38,471 --> 01:13:44,877
So gone are all right?
-Yes, they are all fine.

670
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:52,018
Where is Franz,
why not here?

671
01:13:52,952 --> 01:13:54,954
He's still at the embassy, ??
for final details.

672
01:13:57,990 --> 01:14:01,093
They sent me to take hrtiile.

673
01:14:03,095 --> 01:14:07,399
I said that if
someone asks them, to destroy them.

674
01:14:07,699 --> 01:14:13,238
Yes, I know, but embassy wants before
the issuance of travel documents.

675
01:14:21,413 --> 01:14:27,252
Franz said he wanted to send
von Ribbentrop, a postcard from New York ...

676
01:14:28,253 --> 01:14:30,822
One rude.

677
01:14:36,127 --> 01:14:40,198
I love myself just as I have loved

678
01:14:40,198 --> 01:14:45,736
I decided that for the good of the party
and Führer ...

679
01:14:45,736 --> 01:14:52,509
it will continue to remain married
and we will meet in secret.

680
01:14:53,978 --> 01:15:01,718
It was a sacrifice, but he would not make such sacrifices ...

681
01:15:13,163 --> 01:15:17,333
We'll send a car
for you in two hours.

682
01:15:21,738 --> 01:15:23,072
America.

683
01:15:25,575 --> 01:15:30,246
Franz says he still has Hebrew in America.
Did nothing with them?

684
01:15:31,147 --> 01:15:32,982
All may change now ...

685
01:15:32,982 --> 01:15:35,985
... if you have a president
who thinks Führer, huh.

686
01:15:39,855 --> 01:15:44,460
It was a real problem for me
to make a career in Hollywood.

687
01:15:45,761 --> 01:15:47,563
Why?
-Jews.

688
01:15:47,563 --> 01:15:51,800
They controlled all studies,
you keep away from Broadway.

689
01:15:52,634 --> 01:15:58,240
But audiences loved me,
then the war started.

690
01:15:59,841 --> 01:16:07,182
Berlin was beautiful before the war,
the only thing that I wished were Jews.

691
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:17,758
I'm career in front, but I want
to America, to the Hebrew mind.

692
01:16:17,892 --> 01:16:23,531
What do not you do something
with the Jews, as we did?

693
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,669
What did you do?

694
01:16:30,237 --> 01:16:35,843
I put in cattle cars
and I sent in the East ... always in the east.

695
01:16:37,411 --> 01:16:42,316
You mean in Ukraine
in relocation camps?

696
01:16:42,316 --> 01:16:47,921
Yeah, but relocated ... air.

697
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:53,293
-Excuse me?
-Smoke were made.

698
01:16:54,794 --> 01:17:01,334
They burned bodies after they gassed,
had ... but nobody has to know.

699
01:17:02,936 --> 01:17:05,938
In the beginning was spent,
one bullet each.

700
01:17:05,938 --> 01:17:10,209
The children needed a bullet,
as men and women.

701
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:15,114
But I needed to bring war
of these 6 million bullets.

702
01:17:16,148 --> 01:17:19,318
So ...
Yes, 6-7 million Hebrew ...

703
01:17:19,351 --> 01:17:20,553
... and no bullets ...

704
01:17:20,653 --> 01:17:24,189
... for Gypsies
fools and cripples.

705
01:17:25,524 --> 01:17:30,162
So all Evri were killed?
There was no leakage?

706
01:17:30,762 --> 01:17:39,237
Honey, I doubt that after the war have
stayed enough to live on an acre.

707
01:17:41,206 --> 01:17:43,975
Heydrick was a brilliant man.

708
01:17:44,476 --> 01:17:48,780
A genuine genius
after Fuhrer himself.

709
01:17:49,848 --> 01:17:56,220
Oh no, Stuckart was a genius in his own way.

710
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:06,063
He had a ministry to preserve
correspondence with American Jews ...

711
01:18:06,063 --> 01:18:10,267
... demanding to know
what happened to their relatives.

712
01:18:12,903 --> 01:18:18,809
a postcard every year, saying:
"We take good care of us"

713
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:24,781
??The war in Russia
could not control, is not it?

714
01:18:29,152 --> 01:18:33,590
People bother asking questions
you do not get answers.

715
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:36,159
Children will Saxons live life ...

716
01:18:36,359 --> 01:18:39,696
The war is over
Jews no longer ...

717
01:18:39,696 --> 01:18:42,165
passed ...

718
01:18:43,933 --> 01:18:45,735
... in smoke.

719
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:52,708
And after two generations ...
and will remember who to ask?

720
01:18:54,243 --> 01:18:57,012
Well, now I have to go.

721
01:18:58,814 --> 01:19:02,318
You said that the car will come in two hours?

722
01:19:02,318 --> 01:19:07,489
Yes.
I'll be ready, I'll wait.

723
01:19:08,624 --> 01:19:09,625
I'll see.

724
01:19:36,517 --> 01:19:37,518
Charlie.

725
01:19:43,357 --> 01:19:44,859
Charlie, waiting.

726
01:19:54,401 --> 01:19:55,903
What happened?

727
01:20:06,279 --> 01:20:07,247
Charlie.

728
01:20:09,916 --> 01:20:14,287
What did he say?
Killed all the Jews.

729
01:20:14,487 --> 01:20:18,658
That was the secret of Luther.
-I relocated.

730
01:20:19,893 --> 01:20:22,595
I've given each
each a piece of land.

731
01:20:26,466 --> 01:20:28,668
Look at these pictures, Xavier.

732
01:20:39,645 --> 01:20:41,180
They're fakes.

733
01:20:42,147 --> 01:20:44,750
fakes.
-That must be.

734
01:20:47,152 --> 01:20:53,892
So Luther, Stuckart and Bühler
forgery were killed?

735
01:20:53,925 --> 01:20:56,428
You want this to be true?
Thought it was a good story?

736
01:20:57,929 --> 01:20:59,931
But it's true.

737
01:21:03,535 --> 01:21:05,203
Look at them!

738
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,082
You agree to go
before on my way?

739
01:21:21,285 --> 01:21:25,856
I got here
We can not go back.

740
01:21:30,661 --> 01:21:34,231
You know.
-I raised during the war.

741
01:21:34,264 --> 01:21:40,137
What does "need to remove bases
Judaism biological forever"?

742
01:21:40,871 --> 01:21:46,043
What does "final solution"?
I do not know

743
01:21:47,144 --> 01:21:49,546
This is the train.

744
01:21:51,214 --> 01:21:56,019
"A train one day, 60 people
in wagons, 60 wagons per train"

745
01:21:57,554 --> 01:22:00,123
... are 25,000 people a week.

746
01:22:00,657 --> 01:22:04,861
What happened at Auschwitz and Belzen?
-I can not believe it.

747
01:22:06,729 --> 01:22:10,333
What is Zyklon-B
I do not know Charlie.

748
01:22:10,867 --> 01:22:13,903
It was a gas, a lethal gas.

749
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:17,173
A gas?

750
01:22:23,812 --> 01:22:28,584
They took belonged to them
and gave them his troops gift.

751
01:22:29,852 --> 01:22:34,323
jewelry, pens, watches.

752
01:22:41,162 --> 01:22:45,233
After the war, I thought
what everybody believes.

753
01:22:46,334 --> 01:22:48,169
I had no reason to doubt.

754
01:22:49,871 --> 01:22:52,907
I'm a loyal son of my country.

755
01:22:55,276 --> 01:22:57,779
I served killers life.

756
01:23:02,316 --> 01:23:04,352
How can I say this to my son?

757
01:23:04,418 --> 01:23:07,588
They met at Wannsee
to plan the final solution.

758
01:23:11,892 --> 01:23:14,228
Do not kill an entire nation.

759
01:23:16,397 --> 01:23:20,400
Luther and others were killed
because they were the last link in Wannsee.

760
01:23:22,135 --> 01:23:25,172
It was the last obstacle to oblivion.

761
01:23:25,472 --> 01:23:29,009
Hitler wanted dead for
Kennedy meeting.

762
01:23:32,145 --> 01:23:39,552
If the government knew it would be yours,
reuniuneaa Kennedy was held Hitler?

763
01:23:41,154 --> 01:23:42,922
I do not know.

764
01:23:45,358 --> 01:23:49,428
I have to give these documents
your ambassador immediately.

765
01:23:49,529 --> 01:23:56,102
How Kennedy is here, we will do nothing.
Do it quickly, and then leave.

766
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:03,309
How do I tell my son
killers that I served for life?

767
01:24:05,844 --> 01:24:13,285
How do you explain that a nation
glorious way to survive ...

768
01:24:16,888 --> 01:24:18,690
Is Germany?

769
01:24:24,029 --> 01:24:26,030
You must come with me Xavier.

770
01:24:28,399 --> 01:24:35,506
I can not, it is my country.
-No, not anymore.

771
01:24:48,152 --> 01:24:53,524
I can not leave her son.
-Take it and he

772
01:24:58,061 --> 01:25:00,163
I'm not leaving without you.

773
01:25:04,868 --> 01:25:08,872
Seriously, come to the park tonight.

774
01:25:09,306 --> 01:25:13,310
I'll find a way to transmit
Kennedy this promise.

775
01:25:30,927 --> 01:25:34,363
Sons of the country ...

776
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:42,237
It's time to renew your commitment
The Fuhrer and Reich girl ...

777
01:26:38,992 --> 01:26:43,530
With âteva moments before Air Force One
having him on board Kennedy

778
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:47,601
landed at the airport
international Tempelhof.

779
01:26:47,934 --> 01:26:52,339
... the relaxed and distinction
President Kennedy was greeted by ...

780
01:26:52,339 --> 01:26:55,675
Hello?
-Clara, I'm Xavier.

781
01:26:56,076 --> 01:27:00,013
Can we talk alone?
-What?

782
01:27:01,314 --> 01:27:05,284
In my apartment.
Why not live here?

783
01:27:06,152 --> 01:27:10,523
I'd rather not talk
the girl with Pili is urgent.

784
01:27:11,557 --> 01:27:15,294
Well, come.
-Thank you.

785
01:27:44,522 --> 01:27:47,025
Dad.
-Good son.

786
01:27:49,127 --> 01:27:51,496
Shut the door.
What are you doing here?

787
01:27:51,496 --> 01:27:53,431
Mom just left.

788
01:27:53,598 --> 01:27:56,868
I wanted to talk to you alone, without a mother.

789
01:27:59,003 --> 01:28:03,641
Come here son, are you okay?
I'm fine.

790
01:28:04,542 --> 01:28:08,846
Open your mouth.
Show me your tongue, it's good.

791
01:28:10,247 --> 01:28:17,087
You remember we talked about America?
Want to join me there?

792
01:28:17,488 --> 01:28:21,325
When?
-Now, right now.

793
01:28:23,393 --> 01:28:27,531
And what about mom?
-Just me and you Pili.

794
01:28:27,531 --> 01:28:30,267
I'll explain later.

795
01:28:30,934 --> 01:28:37,273
We stay long?
-Yeah, pretty much.

796
01:28:41,611 --> 01:28:43,379
Okay Dad.

797
01:28:44,647 --> 01:28:47,984
Okay?
Yes.

798
01:29:14,309 --> 01:29:16,244
I'm sorry, you have credentials.

799
01:29:16,244 --> 01:29:19,614
I'm from the press.
-You can not enter.

800
01:29:19,614 --> 01:29:22,217
But why?
-Because I do not have accreditation.

801
01:29:22,784 --> 01:29:25,353
Maybe I fell.
-I'm sorry.

802
01:29:25,353 --> 01:29:29,357
I was accredited, you must
be on the list, Charlie McGuire.

803
01:29:29,357 --> 01:29:34,595
Charlie McGuire, the name does not appear on the list.
-Yes, but you know who I am.

804
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,502
Well, belongs to the group.

805
01:29:42,403 --> 01:29:44,705
Okay? Thank you.

806
01:30:42,461 --> 01:30:45,097
... in an hour or so
we expect the Führer ...

807
01:31:13,758 --> 01:31:16,627
Elliot need to talk.
-Hi Charlie, sit down. How are you?

808
01:31:16,627 --> 01:31:19,230
Listen no time.
Look at this.

809
01:31:45,022 --> 01:31:49,125
Help me, you're the only one who can
to convey this president.

810
01:32:50,752 --> 01:32:51,886
Let go.

811
01:32:58,659 --> 01:33:00,761
You changed your mind?

812
01:33:36,963 --> 01:33:42,802
We fly to New York,
we'll find a place to live.

813
01:33:43,403 --> 01:33:47,206
You can even live
in a boat when, will you?

814
01:33:47,406 --> 01:33:48,074
Yes.

815
01:33:49,509 --> 01:33:57,016
Okay, now
tell me that worry you.

816
01:33:57,716 --> 01:34:00,920
You know
You're sick.

817
01:34:02,154 --> 01:34:05,824
I'll, why talk?

818
01:34:07,059 --> 01:34:11,930
Gestapo said.
-Gestapo?

819
01:34:13,532 --> 01:34:17,068
What do you mean?
-They will help you.

820
01:34:18,170 --> 01:34:21,973
Who told you?
-I called.

821
01:34:24,676 --> 01:34:25,977
They lied.

822
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:30,815
I lied.

823
01:34:31,849 --> 01:34:34,485
Listen son, you're a man.

824
01:34:34,519 --> 01:34:37,422
Now, you must learn
to think for yourself.

825
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:42,159
Stay here, do not move.

826
01:35:06,583 --> 01:35:07,984
bastard.

827
01:36:02,604 --> 01:36:05,073
Come on Charlie, you must go.

828
01:36:05,373 --> 01:36:07,208
Forgive us.

829
01:36:15,883 --> 01:36:20,154
Charlie, come too.
-Please leave us.

830
01:36:23,357 --> 01:36:27,762
Mr. President ... Mr. Ambassador,
Mr. Ambassador, what should I do ...

831
01:36:28,062 --> 01:36:30,064
Mr. Ambassador, why must you do this.

832
01:36:32,466 --> 01:36:34,368
Mr. Ambassador, stop the machine.

833
01:36:34,735 --> 01:36:39,006
You have to see these pictures.
You know the president.

834
01:36:39,006 --> 01:36:41,008
Mr. Ambassador, look at these pictures.

835
01:36:43,410 --> 01:36:47,080
Mr. Ambassador.
To tell the president.

836
01:37:54,779 --> 01:37:57,148
Attention, attention.

837
01:37:57,815 --> 01:38:02,219
Because of the Bolshevik threats
bomb festivities were canceled.

838
01:38:02,486 --> 01:38:05,222
President Kennedy returns
right in America ...

839
01:38:05,322 --> 01:38:08,626
And send the best
thoughts German people.

840
01:39:33,508 --> 01:39:37,879
Come on, hurry up, please.

841
01:39:44,352 --> 01:39:48,322
My son, listen.

842
01:39:48,856 --> 01:39:52,059
It was not your fault.

843
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:55,462
Do not believe.

844
01:39:55,262 --> 01:39:58,799
sure you will grow wings ...
-Dad

845
01:40:02,202 --> 01:40:04,771
-Where are you?
-Grow ...

846
01:40:04,805 --> 01:40:10,377
Dad.
Your-own wings ...

847
01:40:18,718 --> 01:40:19,652
Dad ...

848
01:41:04,963 --> 01:41:09,033
I wondered why she did not leave
you have the opportunity.

849
01:41:09,834 --> 01:41:13,838
But she and my father were the first
where did these terrible images.

850
01:41:14,172 --> 01:41:15,840
the first to know ...

851
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:20,878
and in this way the bound
between them and the victims.

852
01:41:21,646 --> 01:41:25,216
So it remains to
the Gestapo came to pick it up.

853
01:41:27,985 --> 01:41:29,453
Everything has changed.

854
01:41:30,221 --> 01:41:33,490
Without the American alliance
Hitler's Reich collapsed.

855
01:41:34,325 --> 01:41:36,960
Of course, some say
that this did not happen.

856
01:41:37,394 --> 01:41:40,764
They are seeking ...
I can not see.

857
01:41:41,899 --> 01:41:43,800
hard years have passed since then.

858
01:41:44,301 --> 01:41:46,970
But my father would be
proud to know ...

859
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:49,940
that not all live in the house blind.

860
01:41:56,413 --> 01:41:58,414
You think I can keep?

861
01:41:58,214 --> 01:42:01,084
For a while.

862
01:42:01,317 --> 01:42:02,986
Could it be forever?

863
01:42:05,955 --> 01:42:07,690
Yes, you can.

864
