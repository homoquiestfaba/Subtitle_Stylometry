1
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:22,021
Lucky life isn't one long
string of horrors.

2
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,790
And there are moments of peace

3
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,394
and pleasure as I lie
in between the blows.

4
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:50,283
I can't believe
they lost the photos.

5
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,218
It was so rude of them.

6
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,358
Maybe it's better.

7
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,428
This way it won't affect
how you remember.

8
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,707
Did you pray this morning?

9
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:18,445
Yes.

10
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,281
What did you pray for?

11
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:25,118
I can't tell you.
It won't come true.

12
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,620
That's not how it works.

13
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,159
Did you pray for me?
-Yes.

14
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,361
What did you pray?

15
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,398
I can't tell you.

16
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,234
Yes, you can.

17
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,807
Why are your feet always
so cold?

18
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:52,178
My lizard, my lively writher,
may your limbs never wither.

19
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,616
Know who wrote that?

20
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,384
No.

21
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,928
I was dreaming
about Jason last night.

22
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:45,832
About when we first went down
to the beach house.

23
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,868
I can see us
talking to each other,

24
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,237
but I can't remember any of
the words we talked about.

25
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,742
You mean in the dream,
or in reality?

26
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,279
Both.

27
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,015
Oh.

28
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:06,286
I really think this thing
with Jason is affecting you.

29
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,922
Mm-hmm.

30
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,399
You're peeling.

31
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,435
Let me put some lotion
on your face.

32
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:42,121
I'll get the, um --

33
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,723
It's sunny for a while.

34
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,459
And there's only
a very few showers

35
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,061
on the last day.

36
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,697
Great.

37
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:54,534
How long does it take us
to get there?

38
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,569
10 hours if I drive.

39
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,638
But if Alex drives, then 8.

40
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,545
I don't want to drive.

41
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,580
What did you say?

42
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,982
I don't want to drive.

43
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,395
Do you want me to pack
your sleeping pills?

44
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,633
No.

45
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,005
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

46
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:59,532
-What you thinking about?
-It's a long trip.

47
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:09,008
Is it okay to wish that we're
the only two people going down?

48
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,521
Jason wants to see you.

49
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,592
He wants to see you, too.

50
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,435
We should call Alex and tell him
not to come pick us up.

51
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,840
Are you joking?

52
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,653
I'm gonna get dressed.

53
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,779
-Hi.
-Hello.

54
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,048
-May I see I.D., please?
-Yes.

55
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,520
I'm 30.

56
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,598
They sell wine.

57
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,868
Yeah? Let me see.

58
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:52,605
-Looks like shit.
-Yep. Fits in with the spirit.

59
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,712
-Ready to go?
-Yeah.

60
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,315
I'm sure they're right.

61
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,118
They're -- They've told him
it's an aggressive tumor.

62
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,054
And they've told him it's
about extending his life,

63
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,123
about -- about quality of life
at this point.

64
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:20,032
-How long of a time
do you think that gives him?

65
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,406
Karen?!

66
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,808
Do you still see it?!

67
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,327
It's -- it's way gone.

68
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,963
Come on back.

69
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,235
We do this all the time.

70
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,154
Yeah, I don't think

71
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:52,558
we should do anything special
or talk about it.

72
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:56,162
If he wants us to talk about
it, we should talk about it.

73
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,997
But if he wants to ignore it
on this trip,

74
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,066
then we should
respect that, too.

75
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,917
You know, it's probably the
last time we'll have together.

76
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,172
Last week he told me
that he thinks

77
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:44,143
he's going to be healed by God.

78
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,745
Really?

79
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,988
But if that's what he needs
to believe to feel better,

80
00:10:55,988 --> 00:11:01,427
then...that's fine.

81
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,362
He's got some hard months ahead.

82
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,446
Let's go.

83
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,168
Actually, I do like it better

84
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,403
in terms
of just kind of being on it

85
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,472
and not seeing traffic
rushing at you.

86
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,040
-That's true.
-And being able to actually see

87
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,308
a bridge while
you're on a bridge.

88
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,776
Ah, so you can see water
on both sides.

89
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,111
That's true.

90
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,345
-Hey, yeah.
-Yeah, water on both sides.

91
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,581
Wait, why
aren't you buckled up?

92
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:59,185
If I'm gonna die by
going off of a bridge...

93
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,553
-I agree.
-...my seatbelt...

94
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,054
I don't want to have it on,

95
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,023
because what if we drowning
and then I can't get out?

96
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,759
-I'd be right there.
-Who will save you all?

97
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,395
Me. I will save you.

98
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,403
-No, 'cause you...
-Are the pyramids concrete?

99
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,972
The pyramids are definitely
not made out of concrete.

100
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,674
Oh, yeah.
Who invented the concrete?

101
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:25,244
-The Romans. No, the Romans.
-Oh, the Chinese got gunpowder.

102
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,913
-Yes.
-The Romans got concrete.

103
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,183
What about the aqueducts?
Those are concrete.

104
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,886
-That's the Romans.
-But I'm saying, I'm --

105
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:37,089
I'm on your side.
-I know.

106
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,091
I used to want to build these.

107
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,327
Uh, giant bridges
across ocean?

108
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,730
Well, large or small,
any of them.

109
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,000
It's -- just before.

110
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,370
That just didn't work out so
you decided to become a writer?

111
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,805
No, I decided...

112
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,373
No, yeah. It didn't work out.

113
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,643
Trigonometry was not --
well, no, calculus was harder.

114
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,445
Trig was okay.

115
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,847
But I just stopped.

116
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,065
Yeah, put on your seatbelt.

117
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,400
But I didn't do the last one!

118
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,069
Why do I have to have
a seatbelt on now?

119
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,938
I was just going along
with Alex.

120
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:29,074
How about if I do this?

121
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,844
That's... Oh.
Oh, so you get decapitated.

122
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,346
Now it's on my back.

123
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,466
I can't find the keys.

124
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,235
You don't need them.
Jason's already in.

125
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,603
You got that stuff?

126
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,172
Yeah, I'll take --
I'll take the groceries.

127
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,544
-Hey, there.
-Hey, you!

128
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,146
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

129
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,048
-You got the keys?
-Hey!

130
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:09,708
You look good.

131
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,445
Thanks. I feel good.

132
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,882
Yeah.
God's doing a whole lot.

133
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:20,119
With that whole thing.

134
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,956
Yeah.
Thanks for your prayers.

135
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,592
Sure.

136
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:36,168
What's your, uh, what's your dad
got you up to lately?

137
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,639
Papayas.

138
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,341
That's one of the better ones.
That's good.

139
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,510
Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.

140
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,979
-What is that until...
-He's growing papaya trees

141
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,447
in the backyard.
Mm-hmm.

142
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,985
-Of course. Of course.
-Yeah. It's good times.

143
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:59,224
I'm glad you're here.

144
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,293
It's good to see the two of you.

145
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,629
You're, uh, together.

146
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,865
It's beautiful.

147
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,600
It really is.

148
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,106
Oh, it's warm.

149
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,576
Is it plugged in?

150
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,645
And this is hot.

151
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,082
Uh, let me turn it on.

152
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:42,534
Is this mine?

153
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,942
I almost hit --
I almost hit...

154
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,477
It's disgusting!

155
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,779
...hit one of those birds
coming over the bridge.

156
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,314
-Oh.
-Yeah.

157
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,582
I was like swerving,
I almost went over the bridge.

158
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,050
That was -- that --
that's nothing.

159
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,919
You got to hear this.
It's almost --

160
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,355
it's almost too gross
to tell at a restaurant, but...

161
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,623
We're done.
We're done. Go on.

162
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:07,659
Two -- two years ago,
I was in, uh,

163
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:11,163
in Nevada with a friend
from medical school, right?

164
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,765
And we were late,

165
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,033
and we were sort of driving
through the desert at, like,

166
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:17,870
must have been around midnight.
Maybe even a bit later.

167
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,073
And, you know,
the desert cools down at night.

168
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,307
So the --
the desert's real cold,

169
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,410
but the road traps the heat.

170
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,345
So the -- the road's
the warm place.

171
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,882
So all the hares come
from the desert and they --

172
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,085
they lie down in the road.

173
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,553
And so you're driving through
and your headlights...

174
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,722
-Uh-oh!
-All you see is, like,

175
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,892
all these bunny rabbits
all across the road.

176
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,393
You know, like...

177
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,663
You know, you can see, like,
50 at any one moment.

178
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,799
Flying through, and --
and you have two choices.

179
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,200
Either -- either you --

180
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,302
you drive at, like,
20 miles an hour

181
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,703
and honk the horn

182
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,472
and put on your bright lights,
or you just...

183
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,708
-Which any...
-...or you just -- just go.

184
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,746
And we -- we were
in a bit of a rush.

185
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,148
Massacre!

186
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,184
You didn't even honk
your horn?

187
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,952
Well, would it have
done any good?

188
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,754
They had places to go!

189
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,888
-Oh.
-Oh.

190
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,893
I ran over
a humongous cat once.

191
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,164
-Thank you.
-That was --

192
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,266
That was definitely...
He was here.

193
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:25,204
-Yeah. You can't...
-It was just as sad.

194
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,339
It was sadder.
Oh, I'm sorry.

195
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,608
What do you guys
want to do tomorrow?

196
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,812
-Hmm.
-Um...

197
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,448
Why don't we go to
the Wright memorial?

198
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,683
-Okay.
-No.

199
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,017
What do you guys
want to do tomorrow?

200
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,786
-No.
-Have you ever done it?

201
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,855
No, and let's
keep it that way.

202
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,024
I've been in an airplane.
Good enough.

203
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,493
You haven't been

204
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,294
in a bronze airplane
that's stuck to the ground.

205
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:53,198
That's true. I --
I've never gone there.

206
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,467
You know something
I've never done,

207
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:59,905
is, uh, see the sun rise
at the beach.

208
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,139
Oh.

209
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,508
You mean, not here on
the Outer Banks.

210
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,676
-No, I mean ever. Anywhere.
-Oh.

211
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,912
-Really?
-We have to do that.

212
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,080
We'll do that.

213
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,815
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

214
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,517
And it gets us until,
when, 8:00.

215
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,151
We're done with that.
We still have the whole day.

216
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,286
Yeah, but you only get one...

217
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,921
Let's watch this
and go with...

218
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,290
No! We want to go to Ocracoke!
We want to go to Ocracoke.

219
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,591
-Okay.
-Yeah, yeah.

220
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,059
-Sounds good.
-All right.

221
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,327
Say it again?

222
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,863
Ocracoke.

223
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,899
That's a plant.

224
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,904
So I'm always
the last one to hear.

225
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,072
The book.
What's going on?

226
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,275
Yeah, um...

227
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,609
Well, I sent --

228
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,846
I sent off the manuscript
to several agents.

229
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:46,285
And, uh, I ended up choosing one
who I'm fairly comfortable with.

230
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,121
Um, and so we signed --
we signed up.

231
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,222
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

232
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,624
-That's great.
-Yeah, uh...

233
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:56,094
-Fantastic.
-It feels a lot better

234
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,629
than it did a couple weeks ago,

235
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,531
when --
when we didn't have it.

236
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,767
Um, we've been kind of feeling

237
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:06,171
the crunch
with the post-wedding bills.

238
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,173
Um...

239
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,677
So it's -- it's nice.
Yeah.

240
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,979
-Congratulations!
-Thanks. Thank you.

241
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,648
-You deserve it.
-Thanks.

242
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:44,676
-It's high tide this year.

243
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,913
There's hardly any beach.

244
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,882
The family in the A-frame
had to move out.

245
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,251
Yeah?

246
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:56,355
They're gonna knock it down.

247
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,391
Are they at least rebuilding?

248
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,649
-So what'd you talk about?
-Not much.

249
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,621
Do you know
where my toothbrush is?

250
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,657
You put it in the bathroom.

251
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:47,466
I heard Jason talking
to himself.

252
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,741
"The one thing in life."

253
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,947
"Wherever I go now, I lie down
on my own bed of straw

254
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,983
and bury my face
in my own pillow."

255
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,088
"I can stop in any city
I want to

256
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:13,725
and pull the stiff blanket up
to my chin."

257
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,632
"It's easy now.

258
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:23,869
Walking up a flight
of carpeted stairs

259
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,139
and down a hall,
past the painted fire doors."

260
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,878
"It's easy bumping my knees
on a rickety table

261
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,680
and bending down
to a tiny sink."

262
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,553
"There is a sweetness
buried in my mind."

263
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:49,427
"There is water
with a small cave behind it.

264
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,730
There is a mouth
speaking Greek."

265
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,203
"It is what I keep to myself.

266
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:01,640
What I return to.

267
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,509
The one thing
that no one else wanted."

268
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,127
I don't think I get it.

269
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,803
You do?

270
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,814
Let's go to sleep.

271
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,452
Hit the light.

272
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,922
Yes. Yes.

273
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:56,394
Yes. Yes, God.

274
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,662
Bless the lord, oh, bless.

275
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,498
Bless the lord.
Bless the lord.

276
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,901
And all that is within you,
bless his holy name.

277
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,036
Yes.

278
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:08,406
Bless the lord, oh, my soul,
forget not all his benefits,

279
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,375
forget not
all his benefits.

280
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:15,080
Who forgives all my sins,
heals all my diseases,

281
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,182
redeems my life
from the pit.

282
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:11,022
Alex has definitely...

283
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,992
changed a lot more this year.

284
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,860
I was thinking that, too.

285
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,062
He seems different
from how it...

286
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,596
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

287
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:24,135
I mean, even his clothing
is slightly less pressed.

288
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,004
It is.

289
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,305
I think that's a good way
to describe him:

290
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,407
-...less pressed.
-Less pressed.

291
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,013
Probably a little bit
to do with,

292
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,548
you know, you and Karen.

293
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:41,019
Just like seeing the two
of you guys get married.

294
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,188
I think it's affected all of us.

295
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,957
Especially at the wedding,
you know?

296
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:48,159
It's just beautiful, and so...

297
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:53,865
I think he's sort of looked
at his life a little bit.

298
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,501
I think we all did.

299
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:08,279
I think it was also maybe you.

300
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:24,162
I don't really talk to, uh,
well, the old crowd, you know?

301
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,602
I just can't really talk
to everybody right now.

302
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,903
Yeah.

303
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:40,278
I'm so sick of,
like, people calling me

304
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,615
because they think it's the last
time they're gonna talk to me.

305
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,017
What is that?

306
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:54,292
It's like they're defeated.

307
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,128
I just don't have time for that.

308
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,901
Yeah.

309
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,110
Earth's crammed with heaven

310
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:16,614
and every common bush
afire with God.

311
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:19,484
But only he who sees,
takes off his shoes.

312
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,889
Where'd you learn that?

313
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,894
You.

314
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:34,899
I learned it from you.

315
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:12,637
Salt is the only thing
that lasts on this island.

316
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:19,911
It gets into the hair,
into the eyes,

317
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,013
into the clothes,

318
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:25,416
into the wood, into the metal.

319
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:33,424
Everything is going
to disappear here but the salt.

320
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,400
I like to think of myself
turned to salt

321
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,971
and all that
I love turned to salt.

322
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,473
I like to think of coating

323
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:53,444
whatever is left
with my own tongue and fingers.

324
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:57,015
I like to think of floating
again in my first home...

325
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,221
...still remembering
the warm rock

326
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,323
and its slow destruction...

327
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,961
...still remembering
the first conversion

328
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:14,866
to blood and the forcing
of the sea

329
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,335
into those cramped vessels.

330
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,029
Man, it's getting windy.

331
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,333
-Beautiful waves, though.
-Mm-hmm.

332
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,970
We should go swim in there.

333
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,606
Oh, I got the key.

334
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,923
This light -- do you think
this light's out?

335
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:46,958
Did that work last night?

336
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,760
It just takes a while.

337
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,029
Here, I'll --
I'll try this one.

338
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,732
Huh. This switch
doesn't work either.

339
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,200
Does that one?

340
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,436
Hmm.

341
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,806
Where's the fusebox
in this house?

342
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:02,940
It's, um...

343
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,509
I bet it's over
by the bedroom.

344
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:08,646
-Yeah. No, it's in the kitchen.
-Let me get a flashlight.

345
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:10,615
Right.

346
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,018
-It's romantic.
-There you go.

347
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:17,288
Because we want to get
the scent out of all of them.

348
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:20,258
Oh, I can't get
a flame on mine.

349
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,427
Got to go to the source.

350
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,862
Come on.

351
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,668
I don't know if this counts
as a ghost story,

352
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:34,272
but, uh...

353
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:38,910
my father actually
told me a story one time.

354
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,113
And he -- he -- he --
and he's not the kind of guy

355
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,881
who makes stuff up,
I mean, ever.

356
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:47,485
He, you know. He never
exaggerates for anything.

357
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:51,556
Um, but he told me once,

358
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:54,292
when they were still
living in Kingston

359
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,260
in this really big apartment
complex,

360
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,362
um, before it got rough,

361
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:01,399
you know, uh,
real communal environment.

362
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,235
And, uh, he and this girl
were really tight.

363
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,636
And I'd heard him mention before

364
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:09,407
that she had
actually been killed,

365
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,108
really bad situation.

366
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:13,678
At that time, that didn't --
didn't really happen very much.

367
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:17,448
Um, his parents went to be
with the family.

368
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:21,886
And I guess they were
making arrangements.

369
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:27,325
And he came back to the, uh,
apartment complex alone.

370
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:31,462
And, uh...

371
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,298
yeah, he swears on this.

372
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,834
The girl that was killed,
his friend,

373
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:43,374
um, he saw her figure
in the courtyard,

374
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:47,011
saw her dancing circles,
just dancing.

375
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,180
And he just stood there,
watching.

376
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,619
And he never says
anything like that.

377
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,554
And, uh...

378
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:09,433
I just can't imagine
he would make that up.

379
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,440
-This feels so good.
-Yeah?

380
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,943
Yeah, get back in shape.

381
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,478
Yeah, if you want to get back
in shape,

382
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,747
then I'm not sure
running's the right thing.

383
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,549
It's a start.
You know what I mean?

384
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,217
Yeah, but, you know,

385
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,519
why don't you choose something
that you're actually gonna do?

386
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,856
You know, just go for a walk.

387
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,259
5 times a week, 30 minutes
a day, that's all you need.

388
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:41,132
-I mean...

389
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,199
I just really feel good.

390
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,601
I'm gonna get serious.

391
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,670
What are you doing?

392
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,306
-I run.

393
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:54,445
Are you really gonna do it?

394
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:58,616
-Yeah.
I'll see how I feel.

395
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:03,921
-I -- I have never seen you
run before my whole life.

396
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,356
Used to make fun of me
when I went out

397
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:06,757
with my running shoes
back in college.

398
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:08,559
And now you're telling me
you want to go for a run.

399
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,162
-That's 'cause
you wore spandex.

400
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,897
I'm not gonna run far.
You know what I mean?

401
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,500
I just want to...
I just want to...

402
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,036
I -- I just want to get moving.

403
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:21,906
I hate sitting inside.
I want to get moving.

404
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:31,349
-Yeah, let's go out.
You want to go running today?

405
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:33,951
-Cool.

406
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:38,189
-Hey, good morning,
sleepy head.

407
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,758
-Good morning.

408
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,294
Would you sirs
like any more coffee?

409
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,462
-No thanks. I'm all set.

410
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:47,632
-I'm good.
-Okay.

411
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,668
-So you still think
that bed's too soft?

412
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,106
-Yeah.

413
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,475
I don't like it that much.

414
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:09,687
Hurts my back a little.

415
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,822
Let's go out there on the deck.

416
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,697
-Don't even!

417
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:57,401
I made you a present.

418
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:00,838
-No, he doesn't trust me.
-No!

419
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,206
-I wasn't gonna
do anything to you.

420
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,842
I was just gonna give it to you.

421
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,785
-Whoa!

422
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,221
-Come on!

423
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,623
-Come on, man!

424
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,179
-Who lives
in this castle, anyway?

425
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,748
-We do.
-We do?

426
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:48,219
-I've brought topiaries.
-Oh, man.

427
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,554
What's this right here, Jason?

428
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:56,961
-Uh...this...
is an amphitheater.

429
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,630
-Oh!
-That's cool, actually.

430
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,898
-Yeah, and I'm gonna put
some tiers in here.

431
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,700
-Uh-huh.
-For the seating.

432
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,102
And I'm trying
to make the stage.

433
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,303
So the actors...

434
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,838
-That's nice.
-And the players will be here.

435
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,373
-I can make the people
for your stage.

436
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,642
Look, look!
Little grass people.

437
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,277
-The people are us.
We live in this city.

438
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,879
-It's us.

439
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,781
-I'm also building
a sports arena.

440
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,115
We can't have two sports
arenas in one castle.

441
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:19,683
-No, that's a theater.
-This is for...

442
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:21,218
-Oh, it's for theater.
-Yeah.

443
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,521
-So we can do all that gladiator
stuff over here.

444
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,022
-Yeah, no gladiator stuff here.
-Okay.

445
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:28,058
-This is only....
-That's good to know.

446
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:33,197
-I would love to live
in this city back then. Nice.

447
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,632
-Yeah. I bet it would b--

448
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:38,135
it would be real nice
until there's a siege.

449
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,970
Half your family
gets killed by war. And then...

450
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,906
-I've got -- I've got walls up.
-Okay.

451
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,741
But then the other half
of your family dies

452
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,410
from plague and pestilence.

453
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,812
I think most people
don't know that.

454
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:51,248
That actually cities,
you know, wasn't that

455
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,984
they were constantly under siege
and that everyone died in war.

456
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:58,022
They actually didn't really
fight that often in the cities.

457
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,557
And, you know, some generations,
it's, like,

458
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:02,293
60% of people died
in the plague.

459
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,762
Or even just dysentery. That was
a common household thing,

460
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:09,099
to lose two
or three kids to dysentery.

461
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:12,303
Now, these are just -- they're
just diseases of progress.

462
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:16,707
Everyone moves to the cities.
Suddenly, they have work.

463
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:19,643
They have enough food.

464
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,847
And then the plague hits.

465
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,782
-I'm gonna take a shower.

466
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:38,022
Hi.

467
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:21,458
-Wait.
-What?

468
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:22,793
-Wait. I think they're back.

469
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,294
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

470
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,817
-It's not them.
-Okay, good.

471
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:38,115
-I think this goes, like...

472
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:40,284
Watch your head.

473
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:41,952
...this.

474
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,955
And this fits in this.

475
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,628
And two planks in between them.

476
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:53,130
Maybe these. Right?

477
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,032
-These go on the bottom?
-Yeah.

478
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,199
-Right.
-Yeah.

479
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:59,369
-I think...

480
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:03,240
See, they go in between here.

481
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,841
Yeah.
Something like that.

482
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:08,378
-Mm-hmm.

483
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:11,581
Just push, uh,
just steady push a little.

484
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:13,483
Thanks.

485
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,085
That's fine.

486
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:17,654
That's -- that's steady enough.

487
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:20,090
-Do you know what this is for?
-Yes, I do.

488
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,760
-It's for --
it's for our little peanut.

489
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,396
-Yes.

490
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:32,569
-And he will sleep there
every night until it's 18.

491
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:42,079
That's okay.
-Just put your side.

492
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,715
And I'll do this side.

493
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,419
-But there's something that
might need to be fixed

494
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:51,021
before we finish the middle.

495
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:54,324
-What?
-I think that corner.

496
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,792
-What about it?
-It's not in.

497
00:49:55,792 --> 00:50:00,564
-Yeah, I know, but...
-It's best to use corners.

498
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:04,501
-You're right.

499
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:10,540
-Whoa!
-Shit.

500
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:20,217
-I don't think
that's the next piece.

501
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:24,154
-It goes right here.
-Yeah, but...

502
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:30,127
-I'm just looking
to see how it works.

503
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,763
-Okay.
-This...

504
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,607
Hmm. Okay.

505
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:46,209
-The manual says
to do these pieces first.

506
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,345
-I know that.

507
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,617
That's fine.

508
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:08,698
-You know,
I can do this myself.

509
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:11,568
I -- I don't mind.
I -- I want to do it.

510
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:15,472
-You want to do this yourself?

511
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,407
-Yeah, I don't want
to do it this --

512
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,677
the style that you're doing it.

513
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:23,413
I want it to go slow
and enjoy it.

514
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:27,784
-You -- you want...
-So it's fine. I'll do it.

515
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,721
-I just... Okay.

516
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:36,927
Um, I don't think you can,
all the way through right now.

517
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,429
-Well, that doesn't show
a lot of faith in me.

518
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,597
-Okay. I'll watch --

519
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,433
I'll watch you do this bit.

520
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:51,308
Would you like me to hold that
for you while you do the thing

521
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,643
that you know
you're supposed to do?

522
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:58,849
-Yeah, now, get the other one.

523
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,383
Oop! Sorry.

524
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:09,459
Okay.
Now get me some of these.

525
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,273
-I could help you,
but I'm holding this

526
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,374
because you told me
to hold this.

527
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,343
-It's not those.

528
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:51,034
Can we please just do this
without fighting?

529
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:54,538
-Yes, I have no problem
doing it without fighting.

530
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:55,906
I just want to do it.

531
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:59,042
-Just be a little gentler.

532
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,244
-Fine.

533
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,387
-That's okay.

534
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,855
-You're gonna
rub your knuckles.

535
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,890
-Go slow. Hold on.

536
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:17,928
Let's go like this.

537
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:56,666
-Our little person will be
a very good swimmer.

538
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,418
You dressed up?

539
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:20,590
-Yeah, I -- I thought
I would look nice tonight.

540
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,093
-What time are they coming?

541
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,396
-Around 7:00.

542
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:31,134
And so I'm feeling guilty about
finding someone else attractive.

543
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:33,303
And then I realize it is Mark.

544
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:34,704
And I'm awful.

545
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:37,073
-Oh, my God.
-But I was really excited.

546
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:40,076
I was like, "Yay,
he's still really hot and sexy!"

547
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:43,847
But this has happened to me
numerous times, actually.

548
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,783
-It was getting so bad
that I --

549
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,952
we go out to dinner,
saying she's --

550
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,588
if she saw a pregnant woman,
she'd start to cry.

551
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,523
And we couldn't --
we couldn't even finish dinner.

552
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,625
-Oh, no.
-And it happens,

553
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,860
you know, several times.

554
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,463
-S-so you just stayed home.
-Yeah.

555
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,666
-Oh, man.
-It was depressing.

556
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,734
-Thank God it worked out.
-It did.

557
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,369
I mean, you know, we -- we...

558
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,405
My friend told me
about a place in --

559
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:09,806
in Iceland.

560
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,474
I, uh, what was it called?

561
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,942
In vitro clinic.

562
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:14,978
-Why Iceland?
-They have, uh,

563
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,746
supposedly,
a wonderful in vitro clinic.

564
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:19,749
I -- I'm not familiar
with the ins and outs of...

565
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:21,251
-So if it hadn't all
worked out,

566
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:24,721
you'd be up in some,
like, snowy fertility clinic?

567
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,389
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

568
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:32,595
Well, so are you ready
for everything to change?

569
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:33,830
-Am I ready?

570
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,098
-Ready to actually
gonna have --

571
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:37,000
actually have to wake up
in the morning.

572
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,668
-Yeah.
-Can't sleep till noon.

573
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,670
-Yeah. I sleep --
I don't sleep till noon.

574
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,539
I sleep till, like, 10:00.
That's my normal. But...

575
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,140
-Yeah?
-I-It will.

576
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,809
It'll be different.

577
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:49,212
I'm -- I like just writing,
thinking about the next story,

578
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:50,847
um, going to this --

579
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,817
this wonderful café nearby.

580
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:57,954
Um, I get a lot done, I think.

581
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:59,589
-Yeah.
-Other writers are there.

582
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:01,391
It's just a really
comfortable place.

583
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:05,261
I spend most of my day there.

584
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:07,330
-I don't remember the last time

585
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,467
when I sat down to drink
a cup of coffee.

586
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:14,037
Just not a doctor's life.
Man.

587
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:19,109
Yeah, I'm jealous.

588
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:24,447
I hope someday I have the chance
to slow down a bit more.

589
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:26,683
-Yeah.

590
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,518
I hope so, too.

591
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:36,826
-I -- I suddenly just wanted all
the things that we talked about,

592
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,928
like, this full life
that we had planned.

593
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,164
And I was worried
that I was gonna leave him.

594
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:42,732
And I -- I don't know.

595
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,567
It was --
it was really weird.

596
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,035
-Yeah, something changes

597
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:47,704
when you have
someone to live for, I think.

598
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,939
-Yeah, I mean, the --
the -- the reason

599
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,975
I don't want to die young
is, uh,

600
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:57,180
because I don't want her
to marry another guy.

601
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:01,317
Um, I -- I -- I know she could
do better than me.

602
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:07,724
And, uh, I just, uh,
don't want her to realize that.

603
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:09,325
-I thought you just didn't want
her to have sex

604
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:10,660
with anyone else.

605
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,129
-That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

606
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:16,266
Even -- even --
even the thought of that, uh,

607
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,635
drives me crazy, you know.

608
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:32,582
-Sam's ready for more wine.

609
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,717
-We've just started.

610
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,085
-He's always ready.

611
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,588
-I can't wait
to have wine again.

612
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:41,758
-I'm sorry.
-Soon, very soon.

613
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,629
All right.

614
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,031
This is from Yo and Kyoko.

615
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,767
-Please.

616
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:53,603
-Oh, what is this?

617
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:56,272
Is that a squid?

618
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:57,540
-Um...
-Uh...

619
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,676
-Looks like a mushroom.
No, no, no.

620
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:04,180
-Is it a blanket or one
of those little snuggly things?

621
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,816
-It's a blanket.
-Oh, it's beautiful!

622
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,752
-I like the color.
-Yeah.

623
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:11,487
Does that mean
we're gonna have a boy?

624
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:12,722
-It doesn't matter.
-Or...

625
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:13,790
-They can have
any color they want.

626
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,125
-An androgynous girl?

627
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,561
-Or androgynous boy is fine.
-Let's see what it is.

628
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:20,129
Oh, it's a flying heart!
-Aw.

629
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:21,831
-That's very sweet.
-That's better than squid.

630
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,967
-Yeah.
-I kind of like squid, too.

631
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:27,337
I'll settle for the heart.
-That's very nice.

632
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,539
Oh, that's great. It reminds me
of a children's book.

633
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:31,474
-Thank you.
-Sure.

634
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:34,477
-Kind of illustration.
Thank you.

635
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:37,080
-It cost us $2,000.

636
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,482
-$2,000?

637
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:41,918
I'll have to give you something.

638
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:47,323
-All righty.
This is from you guys.

639
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:51,361
Do you want to pull
the other side of the bow?

640
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,497
-Yes. I'm folding. But yes.
-Okay. I won't wait for you.

641
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:57,600
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

642
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:01,571
It's one of these.
-It's stuck.

643
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:03,606
-Yeah.

644
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,479
-It's something that's silver.

645
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:10,580
-Who's it from?

646
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,483
-It's from Alex and Lillian.

647
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:15,585
-Oh.

648
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:17,053
Tempting.

649
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:21,057
-Ooh, it -- it makes noises.

650
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,225
-Wow.

651
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:28,765
Oh, wow.
Isn't that beautiful?

652
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:30,833
-This is your selection,
Lillian? I assume?

653
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,568
-I had nothing to do with it.

654
00:59:32,568 --> 00:59:34,237
It was Alex.

655
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,705
-Wow.
-Really?

656
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:40,443
-Way to go, doc.
-Wow, good choice. Pretty.

657
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:43,079
-Mm-hmm.
-Thanks, guys.

658
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,381
-Congratulations, both of you.

659
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:53,756
-Thank you, guys,
very much for coming.

660
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,658
-Sure.
-Of course.

661
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:59,062
-It means a lot.

662
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:35,765
Is the smoke getting to you?

663
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,934
Sorry.

664
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:19,308
I was just thinking
that I, um...

665
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:24,380
...I don't even remember
Jason's face anymore.

666
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:18,027
Hey.

667
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,199
You know what
I was reading today?

668
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:28,905
I saw that there are
numerous cases of malaria

669
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:31,374
outbreaks along
the eastern coast.

670
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:35,778
They found several down
in Hatteras, in Jersey.

671
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:39,315
It's really weird.

672
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:43,019
We'll have to uptake
our gin and tonic.

673
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:45,855
That way, uh...

674
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:50,293
What's up?
How was your day?

675
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:10,446
-What the hell's going on?

676
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,519
What's up?
What's going on?

677
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:24,727
It's all right.
It's okay.

678
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:28,364
-This morning, I --
I found blood in my underwear.

679
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:36,672
-What?
How much blood?

680
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:43,446
-Let me see it.

681
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:18,514
We need to go to the hospital.

682
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:20,983
-I'm sorry.
-We need to go to the hospital.

683
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:21,977
-I just need a minute.

684
01:06:21,977 --> 01:06:26,115
I just need to pull myself
together a little bit.

685
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:28,217
-Mm-hmm.

686
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:33,015
-Should we transfer
to the C at Jay Street?

687
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:35,551
-No, I think we can take a cab.

688
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:07,570
I made it with cardamom.

689
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,341
-Thank you.

690
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:31,527
-"I am sick of the spirit
of Lindbergh over everything."

691
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:35,898
-Can -- can we skip it tonight?

692
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:09,765
-I'd like to go back
to the beach house soon.

693
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:21,610
-Yeah. I'd like that.

694
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:34,823
The last time
we were there was with Jason.

695
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:37,459
Do you remember?

696
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:47,770
He died so soon after that trip.

697
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,886
-Hey.
-Hi.

698
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:06,855
-Welcome to the studio.
-Thank you.

699
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,569
-These are beautiful.
-Thank you.

700
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:23,372
Thanks so much.
It's all made right here.

701
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:25,507
-How much?
-Um, $18.95.

702
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:28,010
And that comes with the scroll
that I think you were reading.

703
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:31,046
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

704
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:33,015
-Do you make a lot of them?
-I do.

705
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:36,852
Uh, they're very popular,
very popular, about 75 a week.

706
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,635
-Hey.
-Hey.

707
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:55,537
-I want to get this one.
-Oh, great. Terrific.

708
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,072
Let me get you the scroll, too.

709
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:59,208
-Okay. Is that the, uh,
one from the wall?

710
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,409
-Yeah, it comes with that.

711
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:01,677
It's kind of fun.

712
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:03,212
Why don't I wrap
that up for you?

713
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,947
-Okay.

714
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:18,360
Hey, I really appreciate
the, uh, the article.

715
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,828
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah.

716
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:23,699
-Yeah. Um, that's what I had
to go through.

717
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:27,669
-I'm, uh, I'm actually
gonna be starting chemo

718
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:30,439
in a couple weeks, 2 1/2 weeks.

719
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:33,408
-I know where you're at.

720
01:13:33,408 --> 01:13:34,643
Got to be strong.

721
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:36,612
And you're not alone, you know.

722
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:38,614
Oh, so you stay strong, okay?

723
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:41,683
I'll be praying for you.
-Thank you.

724
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:50,859
-Are you here relaxing
before you...

725
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:52,261
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, good.

726
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,662
-Well, I'm just hanging out
with my friends.

727
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:55,697
-Good.
-Um, we come --

728
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:58,033
we come here every year, so...
-Great.

what will you do
for me this year?"

749
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:46,642
"Will you drown out my scream?"

750
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,979
"Will you let me rise
through the fog?"

01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:56,351
Will you fill me
with that old salt feeling?"

752
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:18,407
-So how long are you
gonna cook the corn?

753
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,609
-20 minutes, 20 minutes
and a stick of butter.

754
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:21,910
-No, no, no, no.

755
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:23,912
That's disgusting.

756
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,949
It'll be really, really mushy.

757
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:29,618
-I don't want...
I like this place and...

758
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:31,753
-Great. But, yeah, you --
you like it

759
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:33,622
'cause your aunt's put
the money into it.

760
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:36,224
That's why.

761
01:16:36,224 --> 01:16:37,793
-I don't know if I need
to put the kind of money

762
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:39,661
that she's been putting into it.

763
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:41,496
And I just think

764
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:43,198
I have a simpler vision
of what this place is.

765
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:44,967
-A romantic vision
of living in,

766
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:49,438
uh, this artist's paradise then?

767
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:52,307
-Yeah.

768
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:53,875
-Well, I'll come visit...

769
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:57,379
...for a week a year.

770
01:16:57,379 --> 01:17:00,148
But I wouldn't want to
live down here. That's for sure.

771
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:01,650
-I wouldn't want to live here

772
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,552
permanently or anything
like that.

773
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:05,053
But I'd like to have it.

774
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:06,521
I'd really like having a place
like this to go to.

775
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:10,726
And I like, you know...
I mean, you're right.

776
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:14,296
It's romantic. But I think
that that -- that's a positive.

777
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:22,537
You know, living out in an area
where, obviously,

778
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:26,208
it seems like it could kind of
almost collapse, um...

779
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:31,480
...and maybe not buying
insurance, something.

780
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:35,217
I don't anything about these --
these insurance quibbles.

781
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:38,854
But I kind of would like
to kind of have a place

782
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:40,689
where you don't have that.

783
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:43,191
-It sounds romantic until
the day the hurricane comes

784
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:44,793
and knocks it over.
-Right.

785
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:48,997
Well, as long as I wasn't inside
of it, maybe that would be okay.

786
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:52,834
-But then it's gone.
-Right.

787
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,169
-It's the same rule
as the corn?

788
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:57,339
-Yeah.

789
01:17:57,339 --> 01:18:00,175
You know, I think
you're a pretty good cook.

790
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,528
-Dinner's ready.

791
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:04,906
-If you found a live one,
like, there was --

792
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:08,343
there was, like,
a rule, you throw it back.

793
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:10,045
I guess that's what you're
doing. You're not gonna eat it.

794
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:11,613
-A rule -- a rule of humanity?
-You would...

795
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:14,182
No, there was all these people,
like, gathering around

796
01:19:14,182 --> 01:19:16,284
because they would
see this lady that I saw.

797
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:18,353
And then they -- they would
see us with the conch shells.

798
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:19,988
And they'd be like,
"Oh, what's going on here?"

799
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:21,323
And then they would, like,
sort of hang around,

800
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:22,924
like, look what we were doing.

801
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:24,826
And every time the tide would,
like, roll back,

802
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:26,328
we'd all,
like, scoot towards the shore.

803
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:28,497
He was, like, it was
a little vicious, you know.

804
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:30,765
If you saw one,
you would dive for it.

805
01:19:30,765 --> 01:19:32,100
I'm serious.
It was intense.

806
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,735
This young couple came by.

807
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:37,572
They looked like they're from,
you know, New York or something.

808
01:19:37,572 --> 01:19:38,840
They're all trendy.

809
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,242
And he was, like,
asking me questions.

810
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:41,676
And I'm like, "Yeah,"
giving 'em short answers.

811
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:43,111
You know what I mean?
-"Get out of my sight."

812
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,679
-'Cause, you know,
you see, like,

813
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:45,814
one every, like, few minutes.

814
01:19:45,814 --> 01:19:47,349
So, yeah, I got, like, four.

815
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:49,184
I wanted to get
some more, though.

816
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:51,620
The beautiful ones were the ones
that were still living.

817
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:55,690
Anytime I saw one with, like,
purple hue and white,

818
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,125
I'd reach for it and grab it.

819
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,094
But then you'd see the --
the meaty flesh inside.

820
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:00,428
And you're like, "Okay."

821
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:03,431
So you throw it back
as far as you can.

822
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:04,833
And, um, all the --

823
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:08,103
the darker-colored ones
are the ones I ended up with.

824
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:12,307
But they're still
really beautiful.

825
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:15,076
It's neat.
I'm glad it happened today.

826
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:19,181
You need some more of this.
Last drop.

827
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:23,084
-Oh. You know, so, actually,

828
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:26,855
I had something
I want to tell you guys.

829
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:28,523
Guess now is the time.

830
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:33,195
So, just before I left New York,
I went out and bought a ring.

831
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:37,465
I'm gonna ask Lillian
to marry me next week.

832
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:39,334
-Wow.

833
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,836
-All right!

834
01:20:41,836 --> 01:20:43,205
-That's great.
-Hope she says yes.

835
01:20:43,205 --> 01:20:46,007
-Of course she's gonna say yes.

836
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:48,143
I knew he had something...
-Mm.

837
01:20:48,143 --> 01:20:52,714
-Something brewing since
the weekend began.

838
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:55,150
-When did you decide this?
-What do you mean?

839
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:56,918
When --
when did I buy the ring?

840
01:20:56,918 --> 01:21:01,423
-No. When did you decide
that you wanted to get married?

841
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:04,092
-I mean, I've been thinking
about it probably

842
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:06,895
since the moment I met her.

843
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:09,864
Somehow, it just, uh,
it felt right.

844
01:21:09,864 --> 01:21:12,400
-Mm-hmm.
-Felt right.

845
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,037
I'm a doctor now.

846
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:17,606
Now, I...

847
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:22,177
Somehow I always thought that
I had to get the career

848
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:24,312
nailed down first
and then, you know,

849
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:27,515
when I was 40,
think about wife and family.

850
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:30,318
But -- but now that
I have Lillian,

851
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:33,488
I just feel like, you know,

852
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:37,292
I can't imagine
doing it without her.

853
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:38,727
Yeah.

854
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:43,431
-Does she know it's coming?
-I mean, of course she does.

855
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:47,669
-All right. Here we go.
-All right. Come on.

856
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:49,871
Come on, USA.

857
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:52,440
-Get back, Whitney.

858
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,543
-Come on.
-Get away! G--

859
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:57,245
-Here.
-Get away! Get away!

860
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:58,980
-Yay!
-Watch.

861
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,382
-Take cover.

862
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:04,386
-I like that.

863
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:05,754
I like what's
happening right now.

864
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,822
-I'm disappointed.
You're just disappointed?

865
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:09,057
-It's not over!
-Just smoke.

866
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:11,693
-That's good.

867
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,330
-That's just
very disappointing.

868
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:18,166
-All right.
I'm getting the next one.

869
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:28,476
-Get outta there.

870
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:31,913
-Whoa! Something's...
-Ah, see, that's cool.

871
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:33,148
-I like that.
-Aw.

872
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:34,749
-It's like the last one.
-No, it's better.

873
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:37,218
-That's the Georgia Peach?
-That was definitely better.

874
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:39,154
-I guess it's a little better.

875
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:42,390
-I kind of wish this
one did stop for a second.

876
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:45,327
-Gonna go up.
-I want this one to stop.

877
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:50,131
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

878
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:53,301
-I am able to zero in
on these days

879
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:57,706
with more clarity now
so that not one detail is lost,

880
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:01,676
as if the clarity
illuminated the pain,

881
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:06,281
as if the pain decreased
where the clarity took over,

882
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:09,451
as if the clarity were taking
the place of the pain.

890
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:32,267
-Actually, if it rains
next year,

891
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:34,302
that's when
you should be fishing.

892
01:24:34,302 --> 01:24:36,771
Show the locals what's up.

893
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:39,541
-Fish in the middle of the lake
while it's raining?

894
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:42,644
-I mean, go bayside,
you know?

895
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:45,313
Like that one spot
that we found at sunset?

896
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:50,885
I'd love to build something,
too, you know, something small,

897
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:53,288
maybe where no one else
will find it.

898
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:56,825
But we know where it is,
above the paths.

899
01:24:56,825 --> 01:25:00,261
-We could go down to the --
the Kill Devil Path,

900
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:02,597
down to the trees,
that bike path.

901
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:05,500
-Yeah.
-That's pretty isolated.

902
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:10,572
-Many moons. Okay.
-Oh, come on.

903
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:12,340
Got to think.
What does the woman want?

904
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:13,575
She's definitely...

905
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:15,109
Oh, come on.
I think she'd love it.

906
01:25:15,109 --> 01:25:17,278
I don't know about Lillian
diving off the coast of,

907
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:19,113
-...you know, New Zealand.
-Oh, I think...

908
01:25:19,113 --> 01:25:22,183
Well, maybe not New Zealand,
but, like, Thailand maybe.

909
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:23,551
Dude, this is what
I'm talking about,

910
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:25,386
going the other direction.

911
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:29,224
All right.

912
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,876
It's time to pack.

913
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:34,556
"But he, the rain god,
is sobbing uncontrollably.

914
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:38,393
Sick drops are coming
from his eyes.

915
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:40,361
And he is gasping.

916
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:43,932
And, finally,
his arms alone are moving.

917
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:46,768
And he is in the center
of a huge circle on his hands

918
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:51,406
and knees, pounding the earth.

919
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:54,075
Dry gasps are coming
from his throat

920
01:26:54,075 --> 01:26:57,011
and a trickle of thin water
from his mouth...

921
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:01,749
...while, all around him,

922
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:06,554
violets are springing up
in the dirty cinders

923
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:08,990
and giant thistles

924
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:10,558
and strings of chicory

925
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:16,931
and daisies to pay him
for his tears,

926
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:20,535
to pay the old god
for his tears...

927
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:26,140
...apart from everything else,

928
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:28,509
to pay him for his tears."

929
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:55,269
When we were singing tonight

930
01:27:55,269 --> 01:27:57,405
and looking out
into the ocean...

931
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:04,412
...I've never felt
as empty as that.

932
01:32:26,007 --> 01:32:27,909
-Is everyone smiling?
-Yes.

933
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:30,745
Okay, here we go.
Two, three...

934
01:32:31,946 --> 01:32:34,916
-Okay.
-Yeah!

935
01:32:34,916 --> 01:32:36,217
-Okay.
-All right, all right!

936
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:37,685
Let's do it.
Let's go right here.

937
01:32:37,685 --> 01:32:38,920
One more!
I'm gonna get one more.

938
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,688
With just Mark and Karen.
-Okay. Okay.

939
01:32:43,324 --> 01:32:45,793
-And you kind of -- yeah.

940
01:32:45,793 --> 01:32:48,095
Smile big.

941
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:50,765
One, two, three!

942
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:54,001
-A lucky life is like this.
-That's great.

943
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:56,370
Lucky there is
an ocean to come to.

944
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:01,208
Lucky you can judge yourself
in this water.

945
01:33:03,678 --> 01:33:07,148
Lucky the waves are cold enough
to wash out the meanness.

946
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:13,721
Lucky you can be purified
over and over again.

947
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:20,828
Lucky there is the same
cleanliness for everyone.

948
01:33:24,498 --> 01:33:26,400
Lucky life is like that.

949
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:31,906
Lucky life.

950
01:33:34,308 --> 01:33:35,843
Oh lucky life.

951
01:33:38,412 --> 01:33:40,281
Oh lucky, lucky life.

952
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:44,185
Lucky life.
