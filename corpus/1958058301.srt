1
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:05,900
(upbeat music)

2
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,600
(instrumental music)

3
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,800
- Once it's loaded, we're out of here.

4
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,900
- Radio Evan. We're after the center container.

5
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,866
(upbeat music)

6
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,000
- Damn, tell Evan there's some guy down there.

7
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:09,666
He just took off running.

8
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,166
(upbeat music)

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
(phone rings)

10
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:30,200
- This is Chance Wayne.

11
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,600
I'm not home right now.

12
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:33,433
Leave your name and number and I'll get back to you.

13
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:35,866
- Chance, this is Hector Hernandez.

14
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,233
I found the murderer of my daughter, Sharon.

15
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:40,666
Five years we've been looking and we were right.

16
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,000
It's Evan Long.

17
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:44,566
I'll call you every hour.

18
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,400
Adios, my friend.

19
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,366
(instrumental music)

20
00:02:56,466 --> 00:02:59,300
(upbeat music)

21
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,733
- I'm getting real tired of you, hermano,

22
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:03,866
I think it's time for you to join the choir, muchacho.

23
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,233
(whistles)

24
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:19,733
Okay, I'm personally gonna take care of this one.

25
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,000
Chilly, I want you to drive.

26
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:21,833
- Right.

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,033
- The rest of you, get in the van and follow us.

28
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:28,366
- You got it, Evan.

29
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,166
(train whistle)

30
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,800
(train rumbles)

31
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:59,700
(helicopter hums)

32
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,066
(upbeat music)

33
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,966
(gun shots)

34
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:54,233
- Let's go, Evan.

35
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:55,433
We're hooked up.

36
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:58,866
(gun shots)

37
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,500
(upbeat music)

38
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:36,966
- I'm gonna have to jet us from the load.

39
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:40,566
(upbeat music)

40
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,233
Mark the spot, we're gonna have to come back.

41
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,266
(helicopter buzzes)

42
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,333
(instrumental music)

43
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:17,800
- Neck wounds, both carotid arteries and jugular veins slit.

44
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,000
Pharynx and esophagus eviscerated,

45
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,633
probably post-mortem mutilation.

46
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,533
Apparent petechial hemorrhaging.

47
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:36,300
I'm sorry Hector, I really screwed up.

48
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,600
I'll find out who did this and that's a promise.

49
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:42,800
- Hey, pop.

50
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:43,866
What do you think you're doing?

51
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,766
- Watch out, sink hole.

52
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:57,133
- You'll have a stain.

53
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,000
- Something I can do for you, pop?

54
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,133
- Sheriff's Department retired.

55
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,333
- Well, if you're retired, go peel an apple or something.

56
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:05,666
This is federal land.

57
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,600
It's my crime scene.

58
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,166
So

59
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,966
move out of it.

60
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,800
- I hear you talking.

61
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,033
- Go on, get out of here.

62
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:16,366
- What is your name, sir?

63
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,700
- He's Cam Cavanaugh, federal investigator.

64
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,866
I'm JoJo Golina, assistant US Attorney.

65
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,600
- Well, I need to establish a time of death

66
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:27,200
but this looks pretty fresh to me.

67
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,766
Maybe an hour or two.

68
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,933
- 12 hours, would be my guess

69
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:33,966
- Either get out of my crime scene or go to jail.

70
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:37,800
- Boy, you sure are using up a lot of oxygen, Mr. Cavanaugh.

71
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,566
You gotta simmer down.

72
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,566
This is not a crime scenes, it's a dump site.

73
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,700
From them little fish bites,

74
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:45,800
I'd say somebody dumped him out in the bay

75
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,600
and then he floated in.

76
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:50,866
Now the maggot larvae, that's at least two generations.

77
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,733
And since it breeds every six hours,

78
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:57,466
it's been at least 12 hours since he was washed up here.

79
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,700
Now the next thing that you got wrong is the knife

80
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,233
and that is post-mortem.

81
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:04,033
He was strangled then knifed.

82
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:05,733
- Says who, pop?

83
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:08,233
- Them particular hemorrhages on the eyeballs.

84
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:12,233
You see them little blood vessels, they burst on the cornea.

85
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:14,866
The only way that happens is with strangulation.

86
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,566
Now, the third thing that you got wrong is

87
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,333
I'm not your pop.

88
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:24,800
Although I might enjoy that as it would give me

89
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,366
some jurisdiction over that huge hole in your head

90
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,866
that you keep bellowing out of.

91
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,766
Ma'am.

92
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,500
- Sheriff.

93
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,633
(instrumental music)

94
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:40,166
- What a joke.

95
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,500
(upbeat music)

96
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:55,133
- She was so beautiful, Sharon.

97
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:57,866
Oh God, forgive me.

98
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,733
Maybe he's better off where he is now.

99
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,366
Maybe he is with her.

100
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,233
Maybe they both have found some peace now.

101
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,000
- Peace without justice,

102
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:14,433
there's no such thing.

103
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,633
- You have lost so much yourself.

104
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,166
You lost your wife to a disease,

105
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,000
your son in Vietnam.

106
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,133
You are the only one left who cares.

107
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,733
- And I'm so sorry, Helena.

108
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:36,433
But the next time that I come,

109
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,066
I'm gonna bring some justice.

110
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm gonna find out who killed Hector

111
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,766
and you can count on it.

112
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:49,766
- You're not gonna believe this.

113
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,933
I just checked Hector Hernandez's phone machine

114
00:11:52,966 --> 00:11:54,766
using retrieval code,

115
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
there's a message on it from Chance Wayne.

116
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,933
So now I say we close the account in full.

117
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:06,766
- The parameters of this case are fairly simple.

118
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,700
The plaintiff, Buck, contends that his valuable stamp

119
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:16,566
was lying in an ashtray and was used by his brother, Billy

120
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,600
to send a postcard to his brother, Bobby.

121
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,700
The defendant, Billy, claims that the stamp valued at $100

122
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:28,033
should not have been lying in that ashtray.

123
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,700
And Bobby says that he is now the owner

124
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:33,666
because it was affixed to a postcard

125
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,100
addressed to him.

126
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:38,933
However, the plaintiff did own the stamp,

127
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,966
So the court finds that the stamp still belongs to Buck

128
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,666
and granddad will take everybody

129
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,800
to the park on Sunday and supply lunch.

130
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,000
No hugging the judge until the court is dismissed.

131
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,833
- You used to run a much tougher court, Bob.

132
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:02,766
- Well, I've mellowed since I retired, Chance.

133
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,833
- Uncle Chance. - Hey, uncle Chance.

134
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:07,633
- Hey, you guys getting big.

135
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,833
- I'll be right back,

136
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:10,400
I gotta supervise the verdict.

137
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:11,900
Come on guys.

138
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:13,700
- Catch you later. - Alrighty.

139
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:16,000
- I'm glad you came by.

140
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:18,666
I'm worried about him.

141
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,933
He's been getting phone calls, threats on his life.

142
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:24,900
And the doctor says his blood pressure is high.

143
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,933
So he's gotta reduce stress.

144
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:29,700
And I thought that maybe you could rein him in

145
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:32,966
because he's always listened to you.

146
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,533
- Yeah, he'd listen to me

147
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:36,633
and then he did whatever he wanted to do.

148
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,066
But I'll give it a shot.

149
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,100
Thanks.

150
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:40,833
- Justice is swift.

151
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:42,133
They're outside playing.

152
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:44,366
Case closed.

153
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:47,333
- Well, you guys, make yourselves at home.

154
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,900
- Thank you.

155
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:53,166
- Well, I understand that

156
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,000
somebody's been threatening your life.

157
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:56,266
- A little threatening every now and then

158
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,033
is good for a guardian of justice.

159
00:13:58,066 --> 00:13:59,300
If I wasn't getting threatened,

160
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,433
I'd be worried I wasn't doing a good job.

161
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm not worried.

162
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:05,233
- Is that why you're wearing that round wheel on your ankle?

163
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:08,600
- At least if I go, I won't be hiding behind the curtains.

164
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,100
- Well, Anne also said that your blood pressure is up.

165
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,433
- I sure hope you ain't gonna charge me for this visit.

166
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:21,166
- I just don't want you to pitch forward

167
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,900
and to play the pastor.

168
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:25,500
- So a book says I'm below 180 over 90.

169
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:28,033
- Bob, when I start taking bets on your blood pressure,

170
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:31,000
you got my permission to hook me up to my car exhaust.

171
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,866
It's probably just the thrill and excitement

172
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,366
of seeing me that's all.

173
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,100
So who's threatening your life?

174
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:42,933
Maybe I can give you a hand there

175
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:47,966
- You remember John Paper Collar Dolan aka tidewater Dolan,

176
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:51,066
fit throwing Dolan, half a dozen other scum bowl aliases.

177
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,466
- It's hard to forget the best bunco player in third state

178
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:57,100
till you matched him up.

179
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:59,433
- Well, he's rejoining society today at noon.

180
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:02,400
There's a wine and cheese reception outside the prison gate.

181
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:03,666
You wanna go?

182
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,833
- Well, he's a gas but he's not a killer.

183
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:06,900
- Prison changes people.

184
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:09,033
Anyway, I figured we go over to the prison,

185
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:11,200
give him a little backseat attitude check,

186
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:13,833
like we did in the old days when we were cops together.

187
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:14,666
- Why not?

188
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,433
- No, no, the doctor said I had to quit.

189
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:19,800
I just like to roll them.

190
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,966
Kinda stupid, isn't it?

191
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,133
(instrumental music)

192
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:46,100
- I hear some guy named Hernandez got himself killed

193
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:48,666
and that you've been out flapping your wings over the body.

194
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,100
That wouldn't be Sharon's father, would it?

195
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:52,400
- Yeah, it's five years since she was murdered

196
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:54,033
and I still haven't solved it.

197
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:55,700
Hector and I was working on it.

198
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:57,566
Now somebody's killed him.

199
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,200
See, I think Hector found something and it got him killed.

200
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,966
We both been trying to find Evan Long,

201
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,100
now, he picked up Evan's trail.

202
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:06,966
- Good, it's done.

203
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:10,100
- Better be, here comes your boy.

204
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,933
(upbeat music)

205
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:24,133
- Stay cool, Little.

206
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:41,033
Well, well, well,

207
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,200
What have we got here?

208
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,000
The Poligrip twin.

209
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:47,166
What do I owe this pleasure?

210
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,433
- Well, we just wanted

211
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,333
to welcome you to the free world, John,

212
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:53,500
make sure you didn't stumble on your first day out.

213
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:55,233
- I'm totally rehabilitated.

214
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:56,666
My self awareness is in the green.

215
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,100
I'm a self actualized vanilla sundae

216
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:00,633
with a whole bunch of new skills.

217
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,033
- What kind of new skills?

218
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:03,700
- I can shower with my back against the wall

219
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:05,800
and pick up wet soap with my toes.

220
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,233
- Hopefully, out here you won't need those skills.

221
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:11,033
- Bob says that his life has been threatened.

222
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:12,700
You know anything about that?

223
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:16,300
- Bob, I bear you no ill will, even though you maxed me out.

224
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,066
I think the years I spent in this prison

225
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,366
has forged my personality,

226
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,133
made a whole new person out of me.

227
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,666
And that person respects the law

228
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,500
and yearns to contribute to society.

229
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:30,000
- Well, that certainly makes all the years I spent

230
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:32,000
on the bench seem worthwhile.

231
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:34,600
- And they were worthwhile, Bobby,

232
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,700
They were years spent allocating justice.

233
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,100
I respect that.

234
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:43,800
I respect that with my entire being.

235
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,100
(Bob laughs)

236
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,666
Well, hey, I have a business appointment downtown.

237
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,533
And if you guys would be kind enough to give me a lift and--

238
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:55,433
- A business appointment, in that suit?

239
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:56,700
- Hell, why not?

240
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:58,066
I wouldn't let him sit behind me, Bobby.

241
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,000
- Jeez, out only a few minutes ago

242
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:01,833
and already gainfully employed.

243
00:18:01,866 --> 00:18:04,000
- I hope that makes you feel proud, doesn't it, Bobby?

244
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:06,466
- Beyond proud, I'm orgasmic.

245
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,600
(instrumental music)

246
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:11,200
- Pink, huh?

247
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:14,333
(instrumental music)

248
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,600
- Thank you, gentlemen.

249
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,500
It's been grand.

250
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:29,833
Seems like ages, doesn't it?

251
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:32,366
- But then again, it was a long sentence, Bob.

252
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,566
- But you've weathered it with great style, Johnny.

253
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,266
I'm proud of you.

254
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,866
- And I'm proud of both of you.

255
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,800
I mean, still smiling after being kicked out of your job

256
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,200
by an ungrateful system just because you're over 60.

257
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:49,133
- That's one of the nice benefits of a life of crime,

258
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,533
no forced retirement.

259
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:54,933
- Well, I've got to go, Chance, Bob.

260
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:57,266
It's been a groove in the gas

261
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:07,066
- Another minute and I was gonna need an insulin shot.

262
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,300
- What a yellow piece of phlegm. (laughter)

263
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,666
Come on, I wanna go check out

264
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,433
this so called business meeting.

265
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:15,833
- I was going to take you to lunch, Bob.

266
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:19,233
- Chance, this grunge has pushed my numbers up 40 points.

267
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:20,733
- It's your blood pressure.

268
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:25,033
- A job?

269
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:27,200
A job, Chance.

270
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,466
What kind of job do you think this hair bags got?

271
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,833
He's probably selling robots to veterans.

272
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:34,166
(laughter)

273
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,933
So you didn't notice him, huh?

274
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:43,000
- As I recall, John always named his bogus companies

275
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:46,466
with letters, like his real estate company was LMA,

276
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,766
Land Management Associates, right?

277
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,300
- Yeah, the swamp land deal.

278
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,866
- Here's PBL Inc, that sounds like John, doesn't it?

279
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,433
- That's probably him, let's go.

280
00:19:57,033 --> 00:20:00,100
- Bob, do you mind if I take him first?

281
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,500
I don't wanna get stuck getting you CPR.

282
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,566
- I wasn't ready to take the elevator.

283
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,366
- Calm down, Don, calm down.

284
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,700
- He's in there.

285
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,433
- Don, the check is in the mail.

286
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,266
- Hey, I am not a nonprofit comedian.

287
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,300
I work for cash, Bucky, you understand.

288
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,300
Now, you pay me or I don't do the gig in Naples.

289
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,400
I mean it.

290
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:29,366
- Gentlemen.

291
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,233
- Satisfied employee?

292
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:32,566
- No, just a little screw up.

293
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:37,400
Johnny, you got quite a layout here.

294
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:39,700
Yes, sir, quite a layout.

295
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:41,400
Of course, I don't know about that,

296
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,400
turquoise and black outfit, sort of makes you

297
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:46,566
look like a molting peacock.

298
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,300
- Kind of a funky chic look, huh?

299
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,800
- What do we have here?

300
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,933
- Welcome to PBL Inc.

301
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:56,333
- Let me guess, psycho babble limit.

302
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:58,766
Police Benefit League.

303
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,133
Yes, we've been running the business now,

304
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,100
for what, two years?

305
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:02,766
- From inside prison?

306
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,466
- Well, it's been part of my rehabilitation.

307
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,933
- Who, I hesitate to ask,

308
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:09,733
does a police benefit league benefit?

309
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:12,800
- It benefits the police, I would imagine, don't you, Bob?

310
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,900
- Well, even more than that, it benefits the widows

311
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:17,500
and orphans of slain police officer.

312
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:20,333
As we give benefits with celebrity performers.

313
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,700
- Like who for instance?

314
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:24,333
- Listen, I hate like hell to have to ask you to varnish

315
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:29,366
but Florence and I have to go over a lot of things.

316
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:31,866
After all, it has been seven years, men.

317
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,366
- Oh, well, again, my ears are red with embarrassment.

318
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,933
- Bob, I think we should just let John here

319
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:41,933
get back to his charitable work.

320
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:45,000
(instrumental music)

321
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,166
- Trouble.

322
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:53,033
- Widows, orphans, what's next?

323
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:54,433
A blind man and a tin cup?

324
00:21:54,466 --> 00:21:56,400
I'm gonna nominate this guy for prison home coming queen.

325
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:59,600
- Bob, Bob, now just calm down.

326
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:01,000
Just calm down.

327
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:03,833
Mow take a deep breath, and go,

328
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:04,633
ooh.

329
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:07,333
Just feel into it,

330
00:22:07,366 --> 00:22:08,633
ooh.

331
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,333
- This guy doesn't drive you nuts?

332
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:11,666
- Of course, he does, Bob.

333
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,200
But I'm not gonna get a coronary over it.

334
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,800
Ooh,

335
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:16,600
come on.

336
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:17,366
- Ooh.

337
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,100
- Oh, come on.

338
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:24,300
- Bob, there is a way to slow him down.

339
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,100
- How's that?

340
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,166
- Hello.

341
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,333
Hello.

342
00:22:29,366 --> 00:22:30,433
Hello.

343
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
- How's that?

344
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,366
- Well, you're still an officer of the court, right?

345
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,733
- Yeah, I'm on the roster as a rent a judge.

346
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:41,033
- Rent a judge?

347
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:42,400
- That means that I can rent myself as a judge

348
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:44,333
to whoever wants to shorten their time

349
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:45,533
on the court calendar.

350
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:48,533
- Well, why don't you contact his parole board

351
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:51,033
and get John Dolan assigned to you?

352
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:55,800
You be his parole agent, that way, you can hold his leash.

353
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,366
- Hey, that's pretty straight thinking on your part.

354
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,966
- I can't help you with that.

355
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,700
- Come on, I know that.

356
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:05,833
(instrumental music)

357
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,166
(car screeches)

358
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,500
(upbeat music)

359
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:26,933
(gun shots)

360
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:34,333
- That couldn't have been Dolan, could it?

361
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,700
I don't know if I'm gonna press charges

362
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:47,600
for this drive by shooting, Mr. Dolan

363
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,066
But you got a lot of monikers, Paper Collar John,

364
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,300
What's that mean?

365
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,733
- Well, in the late 30s, early 40s

366
00:23:56,766 --> 00:24:00,533
when I first started grifting, I was 13.

367
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,800
the men wore clip on paper collars.

368
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,100
And it was said that I could change personalities

369
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:08,866
quicker than a paper collar, a supreme compliment.

370
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,400
Of course, I've been totally rehabilitated since then,

371
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:14,233
due to the psychiatric benefits of our prison system,

372
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:15,533
- Well, this is some record.

373
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:19,000
- To deceive is to enchant, Ms Henry.

374
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:21,900
- What a charming insight.

375
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:27,166
- Is there anything else, Ms. Henry?

376
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,400
- Can you believe this?

377
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:30,633
Now he's quoting Plato.

378
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,233
Next thing you know, she'll be taking him out

379
00:24:32,266 --> 00:24:33,266
for a poetry reading.

380
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,466
He's laughing at us.

381
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,766
He knows we're back here.

382
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,133
- Will you just take another pill?

383
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,333
You got me worried.

384
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,033
I don't know, why don't we just put an end

385
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:44,466
into this legal exercise?

386
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,233
He's got an alibi.

387
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:48,500
We both know he's not a shooter.

388
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:52,400
- Yeah, are these ADA's getting younger?

389
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:54,066
This girl looks like she should be conducting

390
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,766
the interview with pom poms.

391
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:58,500
- Well, it's the new America.

392
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:00,966
You gotta get used to it, Bob.

393
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,600
Everybody looks like they're under 30. (laughter)

394
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:05,700
Excuse me, miss.

395
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:07,833
We've decided that it's not him.

396
00:25:07,866 --> 00:25:11,600
So John, why don't you just pick up your stuff at the desk?

397
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:12,933
We'll give you a lift home.

398
00:25:12,966 --> 00:25:14,566
We'll meet you outside.

399
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,233
- Gentlemen, you show wisdom almost beyond your years.

400
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:21,733
And Miss Henry, you've made a difficult situation

401
00:25:21,766 --> 00:25:23,266
into a delightful interlude.

402
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,500
- I'll show you out.

403
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:33,700
- Well, maybe we gotta look at another possibility.

404
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:36,800
If that wasn't John, after you,

405
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:39,700
then maybe those shots were meant for me.

406
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:41,633
Now, Hector called me, left a message.

407
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,100
He said that he'd found Evan Long.

408
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:47,766
And somebody took Hector down, took him down hard.

409
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,600
Probably Evan, maybe he's got me linked in somehow.

410
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,966
- My doctor says I should avoid stress.

411
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,566
I bet this qualifies as stress.

412
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,600
- The Hernandez family, I owe them.

413
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:02,566
There're two of them dead.

414
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,633
I just, I feel responsible.

415
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,500
I don't know.

416
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,733
I just don't trust myself the way I used to.

417
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:14,566
I'm loosing top skill, I can't remember things.

418
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,833
I make lists and then forget where I put them.

419
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:17,833
- How's your blood pressure?

420
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:18,566
- Well, it's good.

421
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,666
- You sure?

422
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,500
- Yeah,

423
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,533
I can't eat sauces and strawberries

424
00:26:23,566 --> 00:26:25,766
because of my diverticulitis.

425
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,000
Every time it flares up,

426
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:30,133
the doctor says I gotta go to the Gerber's.

427
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:33,766
I'm spooning down cream cone and applesauce.

428
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:37,266
Now, how's a guy on baby food,

429
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,866
gonna find a bastard like Evan Long?

430
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,633
Bob, I need your help, but I'm worried about you.

431
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:46,766
- Yeah, well, we're a couple of sad old ducks, ain't we?

432
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,533
- Is it just me?

433
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,366
Are you two guys trying to ruin my first day out?

434
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,266
- It's gonna get better, Johnny.

435
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,100
I made a call about an hour ago.

436
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:57,866
And guess what?

437
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,533
- You finally won the lottery.

438
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:01,033
- Better.

439
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:04,700
Your parole office wants you to have a new parole agent.

440
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:06,766
Wanna guess who got the button?

441
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,700
- Why do I get the feeling it's you, Bobby?

442
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:10,166
- 'Cause it is, Johnny.

443
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,800
I figured that you could start

444
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,566
by explaining this widows and orphans thing to me.

445
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,733
- Come on, fellas, it's been a long day.

446
00:27:18,766 --> 00:27:20,633
John, why don't Bob and I take you

447
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,733
to the dog track over at TJ?

448
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,866
We go every Saturday and since Bob is your parole agent,

449
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,900
he can approve it.

450
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:30,133
Give everybody a chance to cool down there.

451
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:31,533
- Dog racing?

452
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,233
You guys go dog racing.

453
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:34,066
- Yeah.

454
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:37,600
- Below normal.

455
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:38,866
- What is that?

456
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,800
- This is a thing that measures your blood pressure.

457
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:41,700
- Let me have that.

458
00:27:41,733 --> 00:27:43,000
I think mine's gone up a bit.

459
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,966
- Mr. Glass, JoJo Golina, assistant US Attorney.

460
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,100
It's nice to meet you.

461
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:51,033
How was your trip from Washington?

462
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,666
- This is one screwed to hell scenario you've got here.

463
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,466
I understand you even had a tip and booted it.

464
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,300
Who fumbled it?

465
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:03,800
- Well sir, it was on my watch so I guess I did.

466
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:04,933
- What was your name again?

467
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:06,733
Somebody write this down.

468
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:08,466
- Am I getting demerits?

469
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,900
- Just give me the name, lady.

470
00:28:09,933 --> 00:28:12,400
Save the flip remarks for the yo-yos and happy hour.

471
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:16,733
- Okay, am I right or what?

472
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,866
- I'm Angus Glass, senior investigator with Justice GS 13.

473
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,033
And I'm here to kick butt.

474
00:28:25,533 --> 00:28:28,833
You people have leprosy, I'm the leprosy doctor.

475
00:28:28,866 --> 00:28:30,700
The only way you're gonna leave this leper colony

476
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:32,033
is by producing.

477
00:28:32,066 --> 00:28:33,833
Are we straight so far, people?

478
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:36,933
Any questions?

479
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,900
- Sir, we're assuming this robbery

480
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:40,600
was not to steal milk products.

481
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,233
What was actually in that container?

482
00:28:43,266 --> 00:28:44,800
Was it federal payroll?

483
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:47,600
- Any other questions or comments?

484
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,233
This case is a career wrecker.

485
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:57,866
If it gets booted there'll be massive collateral damage.

486
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,600
I will not be affected by its failure

487
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:02,633
because in failure, I will waste all of you.

488
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,833
- Aktung! Aktung!

489
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:18,033
We will now work on getting rid of our aggressions.

490
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:21,133
I want you to take your nerf balls and throw them

491
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:24,900
as hard as you can at the cut out of the evil Professor

492
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:26,133
On three.

493
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,866
And remember, no throwing the blocks.

494
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,933
(in foreign language) three.

495
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:46,866
That was great.

496
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,833
That's terrific, dud.

497
00:29:48,866 --> 00:29:52,533
See, that's why we're all here to share our feelings.

498
00:29:52,566 --> 00:29:54,800
Now since it's almost lunchtime,

499
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:56,800
I want us to take out our lunches.

500
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,266
We'll sit back in our seats

501
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,333
and then we're gonna play famous Americans.

502
00:30:02,366 --> 00:30:07,000
Everybody think of some famous American that they admire.

503
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:08,000
- Hannibal Lecter.

504
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:14,200
- Let's think of famous non-cannibals.

505
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:15,700
Okay, give me some more names now

506
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:17,600
and I'll put them up on the board.

507
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:20,633
(guitar beat music)

508
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,966
- I didn't do it, he did.

509
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
(guitar beat music)

510
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,033
- Hey Chancey, how you been?

511
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:40,200
- Fairer than ever.

512
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,633
You getting combat pay, no?

513
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:45,900
- Look, class will be over in a few.

514
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:47,800
You stay right here, I'll catch up.

515
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,300
Deviled ham, I'd have probably thrown it out too.

516
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,300
(instrumental music)

517
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,933
- Career day, that's interesting.

518
00:31:00,966 --> 00:31:02,600
What is it?

519
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:05,466
- Well, for instance, this kid wants to be a hangman.

520
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:09,466
Mr. Career advice, at 100 year.

521
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,466
But maybe with a little bit of counseling,

522
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,000
we could convince him to be a dental surgeon.

523
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:16,933
- I can't believe the best criminal profiler in the US

524
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:19,633
and you're ducking deviled ham sandwiches.

525
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:21,333
- These kids have such low self images,

526
00:31:21,366 --> 00:31:23,133
someone's gotta try and help them.

527
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:26,233
- Moch, I could use little help myself.

528
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:28,166
There's an autopsy tonight at six o'clock.

529
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,966
I'd like to get in and witness it.

530
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,100
And also, I need you to start a criminal profile for me.

531
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:35,333
- Criminal profile.

532
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:37,900
Wow, I sure miss that field.

533
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,433
One of those 15 open cases maybe?

534
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:43,733
- Yeah, it's Hector Hernandez, Sharon's dad.

535
00:31:43,766 --> 00:31:47,533
And if you come up dry, I won't throw a sandwich at you.

536
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:55,066
- And I want you to meet someone.

537
00:31:56,366 --> 00:31:57,333
Hi, honey.

538
00:31:57,366 --> 00:31:58,100
- Hi.

539
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,833
- Honey, This is Chance Wayne, longtime good friend.

540
00:32:02,866 --> 00:32:04,700
My assistant Heather Loquat.

541
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:06,166
- Pleased to meet you.

542
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,633
- Ma'am.

543
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:09,200
- Come, come, let's go, let's go.

544
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,966
- What exactly did she assist you in, Moch?

545
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,866
Everything you can think of.

546
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:16,800
- Stop bragging.

547
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,666
Autopsy is at six,

548
00:32:24,766 --> 00:32:25,700
at the morgue.

549
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:30,266
I'm missing a beat somewhere.

550
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:36,133
- I will pay you half of what you're asking.

551
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:37,833
Your initial figure was ridiculous.

552
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,333
- Well, I'm afraid that my deal is non negotiable.

553
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:45,833
The package gets into Somalia with the food in two days.

554
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:47,133
There's no end user problems.

555
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,933
You got total flexibility.

556
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:51,466
It's too good a deal to pass up there, Dieter.

557
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,933
I'm taking all the risk

558
00:32:52,966 --> 00:32:55,166
and the theft to make down the delivery.

559
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,133
One more thing,

560
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,766
I didn't come here to haggle with you.

561
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:04,100
You know what I mean?

562
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:07,400
- Okay,

563
00:33:07,433 --> 00:33:09,033
deal.

564
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:09,866
- Good.

565
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:12,800
I'll call you two hours before we leave.

566
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,366
I want you to get some expendable labor.

567
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,200
You gotta get the package out of the valley.

568
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,933
I'm gonna start sealing up some of the loose ends.

569
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:26,800
That's too bad that we missed Chance Wayne the other night.

570
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,533
We're not gonna get a better chance.

571
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Get that nasty little thread still hanging over at DWP.

572
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,200
We're gonna have to use him up.

573
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,766
- You got it, chief.

574
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,900
(instrumental music)

575
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,533
- Hey, where are you going?

576
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:05,666
(upbeat music)

577
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,966
Go run a big Power Plant in the sky.

578
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,566
Let's go.

579
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:15,366
(upbeat music)

580
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:27,233
(car screeches)

581
00:34:29,633 --> 00:34:32,100
- So how long has the coronary lab on four?

582
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:35,366
I've been wandering around on two for 20 minutes.

583
00:34:37,433 --> 00:34:39,033
- It's always been on four.

584
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:43,833
- Don't tarnish your legend, Chance.

585
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:45,300
Ed Hagman.

586
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,300
- Thanks for letting us ride the jumpsuit.

587
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:48,500
- Hey, no problem, Mr. Wayne.

588
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:49,600
What is it you're looking for?

589
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:51,333
- Won't know until we see.

590
00:34:51,366 --> 00:34:54,633
- Chance, I wanna start with victimology.

591
00:34:58,033 --> 00:35:00,966
- Borrow your glasses, I left mine at the motel.

592
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,800
Thanks.

593
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,766
Whoa, what are these?

594
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,066
- Fours.

595
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,233
- I use threes.

596
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:15,066
We're gonna study the victims habits.

597
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,366
Maybe we'll find out something about the killer.

598
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:20,666
Example, what did he do for a living?

599
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,900
- Commercial fisherman.

600
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:28,266
- Smell this, what do you think?

601
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,266
- Has chemicals of some kind.

602
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,233
Pretty strong, seawater didn't wash it out.

603
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:37,800
- Ed, you run me a lab analysis on this shirt, please.

604
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:39,266
Find out all you can.

605
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,100
- Yeah, sure.

606
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,066
- Now people make thousands of choices every day.

607
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:47,300
Why did Hector choose these clothes?

608
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:48,866
Everything's tan.

609
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,733
Tan shirt, tan jacket, tan pants.

610
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:53,266
- So, maybe he didn't wanna be seen.

611
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,600
Maybe he was in a field, something, trying to blend in.

612
00:35:57,633 --> 00:36:00,866
- You have a swear knack for this courvoisier

613
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,900
You come here often?

614
00:36:02,933 --> 00:36:04,333
- Too long.

615
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:07,900
Now the smell in his clothes could be photography fixer.

616
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:10,333
- Well, you were right about petechial hemorrhaging, Chance.

617
00:36:10,366 --> 00:36:12,300
Definitely a post-mortem knife wound.

618
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,800
Looks like he got him from behind,

619
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,766
incision, lower right upper left.

620
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,900
- Left-handed cut.

621
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,133
- Let's work on a left-handed profile.

622
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:24,666
- Why would he strangle him and then cut his throat?

623
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:27,566
- Cut him to bleed him out.

624
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,766
- Well, maybe he wanted to move him.

625
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,466
And if that was his reason, could be a pro.

626
00:36:35,966 --> 00:36:36,766
- Hagman, hi.

627
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:41,366
- I told you to get the hell off this case.

628
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,333
What are you doing here?

629
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,966
- Ignoring the advice.

630
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,366
It's not advice, it's an order.

631
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,900
Find a bench someplace and watch pigeons.

632
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:53,100
- I got a life improvement tip for you, Mr. Cavanaugh.

633
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:54,433
You're gonna see a whole lot better

634
00:36:54,466 --> 00:36:57,333
if you remove them shades inside at night.

635
00:36:57,366 --> 00:36:58,633
- Well, let me give you a little tip, all right--

636
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:01,266
- Hey, Cam, Cam, shut up.

637
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,966
We came here to get the results of the autopsy.

638
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,833
- It's getting crowded in here, Moch.

639
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:06,833
Let's mosey.

640
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:14,266
- Hagman, what do you know about that guy?

641
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,366
- Well, the cowboy's only about the best law man

642
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,533
this county ever had.

643
00:37:17,566 --> 00:37:19,166
Name's Chance Wayne

644
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,400
- I'm impressed.

645
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,333
- Well, only 15 cases got by him.

646
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,900
And rumor has it, that he's got permission from the sheriff

647
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:29,366
to work them in his retirement, never forgot a fact.

648
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,300
- Wow.

649
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,233
Well, what about the other guy?

650
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:35,000
- Dr. Akira Mochizuki.

651
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:36,333
Did all the criminal profiling

652
00:37:36,366 --> 00:37:37,966
till he hit 65 and had to retire.

653
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,600
I'll tell you what, between those two guys

654
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,666
and judge Maximum Bob Smith,

655
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,300
they're about the best this county ever had.

656
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:46,366
- Big deal.

657
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:48,333
- Thanks.

658
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,733
- Cam, get the results and call me in the morning.

659
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:58,033
(instrumental music)

660
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:13,466
- Mr. Wayne.

661
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,833
- Yes, ma'am.

662
00:38:14,866 --> 00:38:17,833
- Hi, I just found out who you are.

663
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,300
Mr Hagman says that you never forgot a fact

664
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:24,233
What's wrong?

665
00:38:24,266 --> 00:38:25,633
- Well, I can't remember where I parked my car.

666
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:28,100
I thought I parked it over there by the service road

667
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:29,733
but it's not there.

668
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,933
- The pink caddy that I saw you in yesterday morning?

669
00:38:31,966 --> 00:38:33,266
- Yeah.

670
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,433
- Is that it over there right across the street?

671
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:39,433
- I don't know where...

672
00:38:39,466 --> 00:38:40,400
- It's all right.

673
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:42,000
That happens to everyone.

674
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,200
- Well, it never used to happen to me.

675
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:46,800
It's very nice seeing you again, Miss...

676
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,500
Golina.

677
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:51,700
- Golina, yeah, that's it.

678
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:54,266
I knew it started with a G.

679
00:38:57,566 --> 00:38:58,833
- You're on the list.

680
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:00,933
I won't forget it now.

681
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:02,633
Unless I lose my list.

682
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,166
Ma'am.

683
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,333
(instrumental music)

684
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:28,333
Arnold, thanks for including me in the squeal.

685
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,500
- You bet, Chance.

686
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,500
Sharon Hernandez is still on the board

687
00:39:32,533 --> 00:39:33,533
with your name under it.

688
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:34,333
- Yeah.

689
00:39:34,366 --> 00:39:35,633
- This is her dad's car.

690
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:37,800
Homicide have been notified.

691
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,433
- Thank you. Thank you.

692
00:39:39,466 --> 00:39:42,500
Moch forgot to give me back my new glasses.

693
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:44,500
Let's make these do.

694
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,300
- Search path right over here, Chance.

695
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:53,500
Nobody used this door, lock's down

696
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,266
- Pretty soon you're gonna start showing up

697
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,600
on my nightmares, pop.

698
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:33,566
- Agent Cavanaugh, we had a crime path around the back there

699
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,400
so that nobody would go contaminating the crime scene.

700
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:38,300
Now, I hate to complain,

701
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:39,733
but you're putting your fingerprints

702
00:40:39,766 --> 00:40:41,466
all over the steering wheel.

703
00:40:43,466 --> 00:40:44,833
- What crime scene?

704
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:46,166
I don't see a body.

705
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,533
- We're pretty sure that this red goop

706
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:49,866
you're standing in, ain't taco sauce.

707
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:00,666
- Who's this, Doctor Watson?

708
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,866
- That's Judge Smith.

709
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,466
He's about to take your shoes.

710
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,033
- You wish.

711
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:08,466
- Agent Cavanaugh, we got a train of evidence problem here.

712
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,100
Now, you stood in the blood.

713
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:12,566
In court, we gotta prove that that's your footprint

714
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
and not the killer's.

715
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:14,666
I'm afraid we're gonna have to log

716
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,500
them loafers in as evidence.

717
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:18,133
Hope they didn't cost too much.

718
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:21,333
Arnie, help agent Cavanaugh with his loafers, please.

719
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,733
- Don't try it, smokey.

720
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,400
- Hey, Bob, look here.

721
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:29,400
- I'll take that.

722
00:41:31,133 --> 00:41:32,600
This is still a federal case.

723
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,666
- Judge, I think you better give this boy

724
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,300
another curbside ruling.

725
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:39,300
- This appears to be the original site

726
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,800
of the Hernandez killing.

727
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:43,633
This car is parked in county territory,

728
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,000
giving the sheriff's department

729
00:41:45,033 --> 00:41:46,866
jurisdiction in the entire case.

730
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,166
- Now that we have established our jurisdiction,

731
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm not going to say this twice, Mr. Cavanaugh,

732
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:56,500
give me your shoes and that camera and then just step back

733
00:41:56,533 --> 00:41:58,566
because now you're in my crime scene.

734
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,633
- This is a federal case, okay?

735
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:02,533
It's tied into a federal train robbery.

736
00:42:02,566 --> 00:42:03,600
- What train robbery?

737
00:42:03,633 --> 00:42:05,033
- Shut up, Bruno.

738
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:06,233
- Nothing.

739
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:07,600
- In that case, Arnold get the camera,

740
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:09,733
and investigator Cavanaugh's shoes

741
00:42:09,766 --> 00:42:11,633
and then show these boys the gate.

742
00:42:12,566 --> 00:42:15,633
(instrumental music)

743
00:42:17,866 --> 00:42:19,533
- Stinks.

744
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:22,666
(instrumental music)

745
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,600
- Predictable as flies on garbage.

746
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:37,633
These boys couldn't catch a cold in December.

747
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:42,933
- I'm gonna get a federal restraining order on you two.

748
00:42:42,966 --> 00:42:44,633
Now, give us that camera.

749
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:47,966
- Bob, I think you better quote this twit some more scripts.

750
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,166
- Can't keep us out, got legal precedent.

751
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,600
Jonathan Lewis versus the US government, 1984.

752
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:57,900
In this case, Jonathan Lewis, a milkman was arrested

753
00:42:57,933 --> 00:43:01,533
for passing into a federal stakeout and held for 18 hours

754
00:43:01,566 --> 00:43:04,700
in a federal office building without being charged.

755
00:43:04,733 --> 00:43:06,933
The US District Court of Maryland found that this

756
00:43:06,966 --> 00:43:09,700
was an irrational act, and that the US government

757
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:11,200
was guilty of overstepping the boundaries

758
00:43:11,233 --> 00:43:13,700
of its authority over its citizens.

759
00:43:13,733 --> 00:43:14,533
- Big deal.

760
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,366
(laughter)

761
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,600
- I never heard of that case.

762
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:25,933
- Made it up.

763
00:43:25,966 --> 00:43:27,833
Had trouble getting the camera open.

764
00:43:28,633 --> 00:43:30,633
- You did get the film?

765
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:32,900
(instrumental music)

766
00:43:32,933 --> 00:43:34,733
- It's a good thing or I'd had your butt.

767
00:43:34,766 --> 00:43:37,866
(instrumental music)

768
00:43:45,033 --> 00:43:47,800
(upbeat music)

769
00:44:05,966 --> 00:44:08,800
(knock on door)

770
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,600
Coming.

771
00:44:16,866 --> 00:44:17,766
Yeah.

772
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,233
- We need to talk

773
00:44:19,266 --> 00:44:20,733
- Well, come in, miss...

774
00:44:20,766 --> 00:44:22,866
Come in, come in.

775
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,900
It's pretty damn breathtaking, ain't it?

776
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:27,966
You want my decorators name?

777
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,866
- It'd be better if you straightened up a little.

778
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:32,866
- I have enough trouble remembering

779
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,866
where I put things as it is.

780
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,533
- What do you shoot with that?

781
00:44:36,566 --> 00:44:38,100
- When I was a boy,

782
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,733
my dad taught me shooting with that rifle.

783
00:44:40,766 --> 00:44:42,733
He said he could pick a flower off buffaloes nose

784
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:44,600
at a that thousand yards.

785
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:46,233
I guess maybe he could.

786
00:44:47,266 --> 00:44:48,766
Well,

787
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,033
Ms. Golina, what can I do for you?

788
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:51,933
- I want the film.

789
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:54,300
- I think maybe you better sit.

790
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:56,433
Your investigators Cavanaugh and Bruno,

791
00:44:56,466 --> 00:44:57,900
they took the camera.

792
00:44:57,933 --> 00:44:59,366
- Well,

793
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,933
when they got to the office, that camera was empty.

794
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:04,066
- Lot of disappointment in law enforcement.

795
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,900
- That's rich.

796
00:45:05,933 --> 00:45:06,700
- Water?

797
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:07,566
- Mr. Wayne,

798
00:45:09,733 --> 00:45:10,800
I'm in some career trouble.

799
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,300
I don't wanna bore you with the particulars,

800
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:15,600
but we got a federal gunslinger in from Washington,

801
00:45:15,633 --> 00:45:17,933
a GS 13 named Angus Glass.

802
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:19,166
And

803
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,933
basically, he's about to ice my career.

804
00:45:22,966 --> 00:45:25,800
- Are we talking about Hector Hernandez murder?

805
00:45:26,866 --> 00:45:29,466
Or are we talking about federal train robbery?

806
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,800
- What do you mean. there isn't any federal train robbery?

807
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:33,900
- I may not be able to digest fried food,

808
00:45:33,933 --> 00:45:36,200
but I could still digest facts.

809
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,500
- Such as?

810
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:40,333
- Such as, they don't send GS 13s down from DC

811
00:45:40,366 --> 00:45:43,366
to supervise the murder of a Mexican fisherman.

812
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,066
And such as I haven't had an 8 a.m house call

813
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,700
from an assistant US Attorney

814
00:45:48,733 --> 00:45:51,633
in 45 years of law enforcement.

815
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,866
And such as Cavanaugh and Bruno wouldn't be running around

816
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,866
like a couple of castrated hamsters,

817
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,700
just because Hernandez got murdered.

818
00:46:00,866 --> 00:46:02,566
And for your information, your boy Bruno

819
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,000
spilled the beans about that federal train robbery.

820
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,800
Excuse me.

821
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,400
- I lost it.

822
00:46:16,433 --> 00:46:18,533
- Now, I looked up Hernandez in the state police records.

823
00:46:18,566 --> 00:46:20,900
His daughter Sharon was killed seven years ago

824
00:46:20,933 --> 00:46:23,233
while attending Pacific Southwest University.

825
00:46:23,266 --> 00:46:25,000
You got the case, you made the arrest

826
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:27,166
of a grad student named Evan Long.

827
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,700
But the file says, he was immediately turned over

828
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:32,166
to the federal government because of national security.

829
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,533
- And the feds waltzed him right out of my jail.

830
00:46:34,566 --> 00:46:35,866
There was nothing I could do.

831
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:42,833
- You interest me, you and Judge Smith and Mochizuki.

832
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:45,833
You guys are law enforcement legends.

833
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:50,033
- Is there something specific that you want, Ms. Golina?

834
00:46:51,033 --> 00:46:52,000
- The short tell is

835
00:46:54,066 --> 00:46:55,400
I would rather work with you guys

836
00:46:55,433 --> 00:46:56,800
than with Bruno and Cavanaugh.

837
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:58,133
They don't know what the hell's going on.

838
00:46:58,166 --> 00:47:00,866
These GS 6's rotated out every 18 months.

839
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,666
They have no street sources.

840
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,566
They don't even know how to find

841
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,166
the address of a crime scene.

842
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,700
- We're going to take John Dolan

843
00:47:06,733 --> 00:47:08,900
to the dog races across the border.

844
00:47:08,933 --> 00:47:12,866
It's a combination apology and parole meeting.

845
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,300
Why don't you come along?

846
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:17,300
You can see this bunch of law enforcement legends firsthand.

847
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,500
- [Announcer] Here comes the rabbit.

848
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,100
And they're off.

849
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,100
Out of the box of down the front stretch, it's number eight.

850
00:47:27,133 --> 00:47:29,566
Jungle Jim with number three.

851
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,400
- Johnny, I don't wanna spoil your appetite,

852
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:35,033
but I got a list of PBL benefits thrown last year.

853
00:47:35,066 --> 00:47:36,700
You guys threw one in Del.

854
00:47:36,733 --> 00:47:38,933
The only thing is I can't find a license for you

855
00:47:38,966 --> 00:47:40,500
to do business in North Carolina.

856
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,233
- Well, at least you'll have something to go to bed with.

857
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:50,033
- You bet.

858
00:47:50,066 --> 00:47:51,300
- Thank you.

859
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:52,200
- What are you eating, french fries now?

860
00:47:52,233 --> 00:47:53,466
- No, these are for JoJo.

861
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,400
You know I don't eat anything fried and all.

862
00:47:56,433 --> 00:47:58,333
- The wheel chair competition begin.

863
00:47:58,366 --> 00:48:01,033
Listen, Bob, since we're talking

864
00:48:01,066 --> 00:48:04,200
about the finer points in PBL, I've been in contact

865
00:48:04,233 --> 00:48:06,033
with Sheriff Elmer Whitaker about having a do

866
00:48:06,066 --> 00:48:08,233
right here in San Diego.

867
00:48:08,266 --> 00:48:09,900
- So what are you telling me for?

868
00:48:09,933 --> 00:48:11,766
- He said that since you're my parole officer,

869
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,666
if you said yes, he'd sign off on it.

870
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,900
- I figure I'll say yes, about at the same time

871
00:48:15,933 --> 00:48:17,400
Palm Beach gets a black mayor.

872
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:20,100
- You are a cynical man.

873
00:48:20,133 --> 00:48:23,500
Now, see, the idea is, I wanna present Chance

874
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:27,000
with the Eliot Ness law enforcement merits award

875
00:48:27,033 --> 00:48:30,033
right there at the banquet, brass plaque,

876
00:48:30,066 --> 00:48:32,566
newspaper reporters, the whole thing.

877
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,800
- How do you think of all this stuff?

878
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:36,633
- I wanna honor Chance for a lifetime

879
00:48:36,666 --> 00:48:38,033
of busting felons, man.

880
00:48:38,066 --> 00:48:41,266
- Well, you're a felon, why don't you to a testimonial?

881
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,533
- He won't have to

882
00:48:42,566 --> 00:48:44,633
'cause I don't wanna be a part of his scam.

883
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:47,000
- Oh, gee, that's too bad, Chance.

884
00:48:47,033 --> 00:48:48,466
Because there's a cash and dime

885
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,900
that goes with the Ness award.

886
00:48:49,933 --> 00:48:52,133
(laughter)

887
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:53,266
- $10,000.

888
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:58,066
(instrumental music)

889
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,400
- All right, no matter.

890
00:49:01,566 --> 00:49:03,400
Just remember you were my first choice.

891
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:07,166
Number five, number five,

892
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:07,966
yes!

893
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:14,200
Woo hoo, big bad John wins again. (laughs)

894
00:49:14,933 --> 00:49:15,433
- No five.

895
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,000
No five.

896
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,266
- You didn't get our bet down, did you?

897
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,033
- Yep, just before they closed.

898
00:49:24,066 --> 00:49:26,033
- Thanks a lot.

899
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:28,633
- We're gonna stick to lotto, boys.

900
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,233
- What, losers again?

901
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:31,733
How many nacho, Bob?

902
00:49:31,766 --> 00:49:33,966
- Get outta there, Johnny.

903
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,266
- Chance, you got three tacos.

904
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,100
- They got plenty of them out there, John.

905
00:49:37,133 --> 00:49:39,033
- John, you can share my french fries.

906
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:40,866
- You are a darling.

907
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,433
- Don't feed the animals, JoJo.

908
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:47,900
- You know I really could help you guys.

909
00:49:47,933 --> 00:49:51,166
That fives, five now that's the trip.

910
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,433
- You're hunch better.

911
00:49:52,466 --> 00:49:54,000
I thought you were slicker than that.

912
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:57,033
- I'm cashing my tickets in and you turn yours up.

913
00:49:57,066 --> 00:49:58,833
- Hey, Bobby, what you taking there?

914
00:49:58,866 --> 00:50:01,833
- Well, these are Vasotec, that's Lenoltec,

915
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:03,366
high blood pressure.

916
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,300
And this little red doohickey here,

917
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:08,133
I got from the health food store and that helps me poop.

918
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:09,633
- Really? - Really.

919
00:50:10,533 --> 00:50:12,066
- Can I try some of those?

920
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,166
- Sure, take a few for the weekend.

921
00:50:15,033 --> 00:50:16,566
- Thanks, man.

922
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,000
- Yeah. What is that, Chance?

923
00:50:18,033 --> 00:50:21,200
- Well, this white one is for my diverticulitis

924
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:26,133
and these two little blue ones is for my arthritic knee.

925
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:28,666
You remember that brawl back in '56, John?

926
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,600
The first time that I busted you for running a boiler room

927
00:50:31,633 --> 00:50:33,966
and I blew my knee out chasing you.

928
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:38,233
- It wasn't one of my finer operations.

929
00:50:38,266 --> 00:50:39,366
- Why don't you give me one of them blue ones?

930
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,466
My elbows been killing me.

931
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,200
- Oh, yeah. won't hurt anything.

932
00:50:42,233 --> 00:50:43,066
They're not prescription.

933
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,500
- What is that, Moch?

934
00:50:44,533 --> 00:50:47,933
- These are synthetic rejuvenators

935
00:50:47,966 --> 00:50:50,100
that I'm testing for the FDA.

936
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:52,400
Is that what cocks the hammer in your pistol?

937
00:50:54,033 --> 00:50:55,933
- Let me try one of those. - How quick do they work?

938
00:50:55,966 --> 00:50:59,933
- Fellows, strictly for experimental use right now, sorry.

939
00:51:01,766 --> 00:51:03,066
- You guys are really a laugh.

940
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:07,966
Here you are exchanging medicine like a bunch of old ladies,

941
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,266
afraid to eat fried foods,

942
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,866
you've got to learn to live a little, come on.

943
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,233
- You keep eating those french fries,

944
00:51:15,266 --> 00:51:16,833
you're gonna need a bypass.

945
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:18,133
- Amen.

946
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:20,566
- And now, I'm gonna go cash in.

947
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,300
- [Announcer] And they're coming around the final turn.

948
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:31,533
It's number five in the lead, number three is second,

949
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:35,166
with number one going ahead at the finish.

950
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,266
Number five is the winner.

951
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,233
- Can you believe that I'm having?

952
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:40,266
Forget about that puppy.

953
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,400
50 bucks on the nose.

954
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:46,233
Well, how are you doing, Bob?

955
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,366
- You bet fine.

956
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,300
- You keep it up, John.

957
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:50,266
Your parole evaluation hearing

958
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,433
is gonna come up between races

959
00:51:52,466 --> 00:51:55,233
- [Announcer] and number three take 380 to show.

960
00:51:55,266 --> 00:51:56,266
Get your bets down--

961
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,033
- Cash in, again.

962
00:52:00,066 --> 00:52:01,233
- Trust, right?

963
00:52:01,266 --> 00:52:02,833
Go ahead.

964
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:04,866
- I wanna know about that train robbery.

965
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:07,366
- It was federal payroll.

966
00:52:08,566 --> 00:52:10,100
They were shipping in a dairy container

967
00:52:10,133 --> 00:52:12,166
and it was lifted off by a helicopter.

968
00:52:15,033 --> 00:52:16,833
- There are your train robbers, gang.

969
00:52:19,933 --> 00:52:20,666
- I know this guy.

970
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,466
- You do?

971
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,133
- Yeah, Hollis.

972
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:26,300
Hollis something, I don't know.

973
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:28,266
He was in with me, a short timer.

974
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,100
Hard case, get down robber

975
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:32,366
You know anybody that knows him so we can get a line on him?

976
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,266
Yeah, I'll have a look around

977
00:52:35,766 --> 00:52:39,700
if you reconsider the PBL awards banquet.

978
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:42,733
- Here we go again, guys.

979
00:52:42,766 --> 00:52:45,833
- Okay, I'll reconsider, I'll think about it.

980
00:52:47,266 --> 00:52:48,866
But you work both sides of the street,

981
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,933
and you'll drop an envelope.

982
00:52:50,966 --> 00:52:51,700
- I'm thrilled, Chance.

983
00:52:51,733 --> 00:52:53,666
I am really thrilled.

984
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,800
- I'm fibrillating.

985
00:52:56,066 --> 00:52:57,366
- Fives, Bob.

986
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,900
$5,000. (laughs)

987
00:53:01,933 --> 00:53:05,000
(instrumental music)

988
00:53:07,233 --> 00:53:09,800
(upbeat music)

989
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:14,766
- Look at these idiots.

990
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,200
They're gonna end up glowing in the dark.

991
00:53:17,233 --> 00:53:19,733
(upbeat music)

992
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:47,466
- (in foreign language)

993
00:54:01,466 --> 00:54:03,233
- Thank you, Rich.

994
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:10,466
Michelle.

995
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,666
- Yes.

996
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,300
- Listen, when I ask for change,

997
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,433
would you be so kind as to bring me this bill?

998
00:54:16,466 --> 00:54:18,100
- Okay.

999
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:19,766
- I'll be sitting right over there with three other guys.

1000
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,266
- All right, great.

1001
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,300
- Thank you, Michelle.

1002
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,133
- You're welcome.

1003
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,433
- He said he found the guy?

1004
00:54:35,466 --> 00:54:37,266
- That's what he said.

1005
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,400
(guitar beat music)

1006
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,333
- You guys remind me of a bowling team.

1007
00:54:48,366 --> 00:54:49,900
Don't you ever go around with women?

1008
00:54:49,933 --> 00:54:52,033
- You said he was here, where is he?

1009
00:54:52,066 --> 00:54:53,933
- He's just going over to the bar now.

1010
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:56,666
Guy in the leather jacket.

1011
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,700
His name is Hollis Davis according to the bartender.

1012
00:54:59,733 --> 00:55:01,866
I walked by him three times, he didn't recognize me.

1013
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,500
- Well, I say we sit on him see where he goes.

1014
00:55:04,533 --> 00:55:06,266
- Oh, by the way, Bob, they sell

1015
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,733
lottery tickets over at the bar.

1016
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:09,166
And since you go for those sucker bets,

1017
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,133
I thought maybe you'd like to buy one.

1018
00:55:11,166 --> 00:55:13,933
Just remember to ask for lots of fives.

1019
00:55:13,966 --> 00:55:15,233
- Why buy fives?

1020
00:55:15,266 --> 00:55:17,433
- Don't humor him, Bob, he's screwing with us.

1021
00:55:17,466 --> 00:55:19,800
- You mean, why is five a better number?

1022
00:55:20,866 --> 00:55:24,066
Is that the question? (laughs)

1023
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,533
That's unbelievable.

1024
00:55:25,566 --> 00:55:28,033
- Why, pray tell, is a five a better number

1025
00:55:28,066 --> 00:55:29,500
than anything else?

1026
00:55:29,533 --> 00:55:31,666
- Bob, just let it be, okay.

1027
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,800
- Because Bobby, the number five appears

1028
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:36,933
most frequently in any random selection of numbers.

1029
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:39,166
It has been scientifically proven.

1030
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,500
Everybody in the planet knows it, except I guess you guys.

1031
00:55:42,533 --> 00:55:43,533
- You wanna bet?

1032
00:55:43,566 --> 00:55:45,133
- Oh, come on, man.

1033
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:46,566
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1034
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,233
You think I'm born under a mushroom somewhere, I see.

1035
00:55:50,266 --> 00:55:51,100
Let's go.

1036
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:53,600
I bet $50.

1037
00:55:53,633 --> 00:55:54,400
- Okay.

1038
00:55:54,433 --> 00:55:55,733
- How can you prove it?

1039
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:57,800
- We'll use the serial numbers on this bill.

1040
00:55:57,833 --> 00:55:59,400
- Oh, no, no.

1041
00:55:59,433 --> 00:56:01,866
- Oh get real, doofus, we're not using your bill.

1042
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,766
- Miss, would you bring me a change for a 10, please?

1043
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,700
Five and some ones.

1044
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:10,466
Okay, does that make you feel better now?

1045
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,966
- It certainly does.

1046
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,500
- All right. Now, I say there's more fives

1047
00:56:16,533 --> 00:56:19,133
on this bill than any other number.

1048
00:56:19,166 --> 00:56:20,366
- We're talking only serial number.

1049
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,300
- Only serial number.

1050
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:22,533
- I got in.

1051
00:56:22,566 --> 00:56:23,700
- I got in the little bet myself.

1052
00:56:28,433 --> 00:56:29,833
- I'll cover you.

1053
00:56:29,866 --> 00:56:30,800
Read them and weep.

1054
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,366
(game show music)

1055
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,700
(guitar beat)

1056
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:42,666
- What? - What?

1057
00:56:46,366 --> 00:56:48,133
- There are four fives on this bill.

1058
00:56:50,633 --> 00:56:52,033
- Get out of here.

1059
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:55,500
How did you do that?

1060
00:56:55,533 --> 00:56:56,533
- Simple mathematics

1061
00:56:56,566 --> 00:56:59,200
and the random choice probability groove.

1062
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:02,366
(instrumental music)

1063
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,000
I think your boy is leaving now.

1064
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,733
Good luck.

1065
00:57:11,766 --> 00:57:13,233
- Oh, come on, you're going with me.

1066
00:57:13,266 --> 00:57:14,633
- Why do I have to go with you guys?

1067
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:16,633
- I'm your parole officer, sir.

1068
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:17,866
And you, my dear man,

1069
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,066
are in flagrant violation of your parole.

1070
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,533
- For what?

1071
00:57:21,566 --> 00:57:23,966
- Gambling in an establishment that serves liquor.

1072
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,600
And besides, you're loaded with the evidence.

1073
00:57:26,633 --> 00:57:28,400
This is a bust.

1074
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,200
- Bad Bob Smith.

1075
00:57:31,233 --> 00:57:34,366
(instrumental music)

1076
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:04,566
- Moch, give me the pictures.

1077
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,633
- Right

1078
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,433
- This keeps getting better.

1079
00:58:14,466 --> 00:58:15,966
Let's go

1080
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,233
- I'm on point, let me go first.

1081
00:58:19,266 --> 00:58:20,800
You cover me.

1082
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:21,566
I'll keep John with me.

1083
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,666
- Fine.

1084
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,366
- How are you gonna protect me with that?

1085
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,133
I'm going to get hooker real quick.

1086
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:30,600
- Bob, you better use this.

1087
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:33,300
- I don't think I should be here.

1088
00:58:34,133 --> 00:58:36,700
(upbeat music)

1089
00:58:48,933 --> 00:58:49,833
- That's Hector's boat.

1090
00:58:49,866 --> 00:58:52,600
He took me out on it once.

1091
00:58:52,633 --> 00:58:53,400
- Ready?

1092
00:58:53,433 --> 00:58:54,200
- Yeah.

1093
00:58:54,233 --> 00:58:55,700
- Let's go.

1094
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:58,566
(instrumental music)

1095
00:59:07,733 --> 00:59:10,166
(gun shots)

1096
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,366
(upbeat music)

1097
00:59:23,466 --> 00:59:25,066
- Are you all right?

1098
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,400
- Yeah, how can you ask me that?

1099
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:28,933
I'm leaking like a bag of sand.

1100
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,100
(gun shots)

1101
00:59:47,733 --> 00:59:51,333
- Hey Chance, give me one of them guns, man.

1102
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:56,100
Come on, Chancey, they're getting away.

1103
00:59:56,133 --> 00:59:58,100
- Yeah, Chance, do it.

1104
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:01,700
- Well, you are his parole officer.

1105
01:00:05,633 --> 01:00:06,666
Let's go.

1106
01:00:09,633 --> 01:00:12,033
(gun shots)

1107
01:00:20,133 --> 01:00:22,733
- This gun is a labyrinth shell.

1108
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:25,033
- You're pulling right.

1109
01:00:25,066 --> 01:00:28,266
You gotta aim low and fire slow.

1110
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,700
- Listen, I didn't see you hit anything out there, Chance.

1111
01:00:31,733 --> 01:00:33,733
Maybe you should have worn your glasses.

1112
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:38,100
- Is he all right?

1113
01:00:40,966 --> 01:00:43,100
- He'll be all right.

1114
01:00:43,133 --> 01:00:44,166
It went clean through.

1115
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,066
- You used to shoot the 900.

1116
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,466
Didn't get a shot off.

1117
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,566
- Hey, you were always the first one through the door, punk.

1118
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,666
You're the best.

1119
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,733
- Are you two guys bonding?

1120
01:00:56,766 --> 01:00:58,766
You are bonding, aren't you?

1121
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,000
That's beautiful.

1122
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:01,766
That's real beautiful.

1123
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:02,833
- My

1124
01:01:02,866 --> 01:01:04,333
blood pressure is

1125
01:01:04,366 --> 01:01:05,233
going down.

1126
01:01:06,566 --> 01:01:08,033
Does that mean anything?

1127
01:01:08,066 --> 01:01:09,466
- Get him to the hospital, Moch.

1128
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,166
I wanna see what they were after on the boat.

1129
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,600
- All right, now.

1130
01:01:13,633 --> 01:01:16,933
(instrumental music)

1131
01:01:16,966 --> 01:01:18,566
- Thanks for the backup, John.

1132
01:01:20,133 --> 01:01:21,533
- I didn't hit anything.

1133
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:24,900
I never could shoot straight.

1134
01:01:24,933 --> 01:01:27,633
- Nobody would expect you to, you're a conman.

1135
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,200
It's the thought that counts. (laughter)

1136
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:34,433
(instrumental music)

1137
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:44,933
Here's where he developed the pictures.

1138
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,933
Maybe there's some negatives or prints around.

1139
01:01:54,733 --> 01:01:57,766
- You know all of those pistolocos in the prison

1140
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:01,566
used to hide their valuables behind a picture of Jesus.

1141
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,700
You got here.

1142
01:02:10,933 --> 01:02:11,733
- Evan Long.

1143
01:02:12,933 --> 01:02:14,100
Hector did find him.

1144
01:02:14,133 --> 01:02:15,966
That's why he called me, I knew it

1145
01:02:17,466 --> 01:02:19,766
- That looks like the nuclear power plant at San Onofre.

1146
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,900
- Yeah, nuclear power plant.

1147
01:02:21,933 --> 01:02:23,233
Somebody's estate.

1148
01:02:24,933 --> 01:02:26,333
What the hell's going on?

1149
01:02:26,366 --> 01:02:27,133
Let's get out of here.

1150
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:28,033
- You bet it, let's go.

1151
01:02:34,633 --> 01:02:38,533
- Well, Mr. Cavanaugh, we seem to be on the same schedule.

1152
01:02:38,566 --> 01:02:39,833
- Well, that's gonna change.

1153
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,933
- Ms. Golina, you're relieved of your duties

1154
01:02:42,966 --> 01:02:44,233
and on suspension.

1155
01:02:44,266 --> 01:02:45,766
- Under what section and clause?

1156
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,233
- I'll think of something,

1157
01:02:47,266 --> 01:02:49,900
start with disobeying a direct order.

1158
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:52,266
Agent Cavanaugh, put Ms. Golina under arrest.

1159
01:02:53,233 --> 01:02:54,766
- Cam, you lay a hand on me,

1160
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,766
and I'll file false arrest charges against you.

1161
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,000
- Let's lighten up, fellows.

1162
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:00,800
Moch.

1163
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,600
You see we have a protective feeling for this lady.

1164
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,833
- Arrest her Agent Cavanaugh, that's an order.

1165
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:12,100
- Wait right here, just a second

1166
01:03:14,066 --> 01:03:15,666
- Elmer, we've got a problem.

1167
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:25,466
- I'm Elmer Whitaker, sheriff of San Diego County,

1168
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,966
something we can do for you, sir?

1169
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,833
- I'm Angus Glass GS 13.

1170
01:03:28,866 --> 01:03:30,000
- We've got a problem

1171
01:03:30,033 --> 01:03:32,266
with the federal government here, Mr. Glass?

1172
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,666
- It's way over your head.

1173
01:03:34,933 --> 01:03:38,033
This cadaver is part of a federal investigation.

1174
01:03:38,066 --> 01:03:39,866
- Well, then you got a federal case number.

1175
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,000
It's a C number, classified.

1176
01:03:42,033 --> 01:03:43,400
- Unless you can give me a case number

1177
01:03:43,433 --> 01:03:45,933
or a damn good reason why I should think otherwise,

1178
01:03:45,966 --> 01:03:47,900
I'll have to ask you and your investigator

1179
01:03:47,933 --> 01:03:49,833
to vacate these premises while my coroner

1180
01:03:49,866 --> 01:03:52,900
completes his examination, Mr. Glass.

1181
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:54,066
- Have an apple, Mr. Glass

1182
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:08,500
- Right-handed, too bad.

1183
01:04:08,533 --> 01:04:09,500
- I better go deal with this.

1184
01:04:09,533 --> 01:04:10,766
Can you give me a lift?

1185
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,966
- You bet.

1186
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,933
- Chance, this guy can't be Chilly Delgado,

1187
01:04:13,966 --> 01:04:17,533
even though his prints and his dental say he is.

1188
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:18,800
- How's that?

1189
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:22,766
- Well, his background file says Chilly Delgado

1190
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:26,766
was in an institution for alcoholism '85 to '87.

1191
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,400
During that time his kidneys shut down

1192
01:04:28,433 --> 01:04:29,866
and they had to remove one.

1193
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:32,966
Someone's been screwing with the NCI computer

1194
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,100
because this guy has still got both of his.

1195
01:04:48,933 --> 01:04:51,933
- Hey, Chance, you got a minute?

1196
01:04:51,966 --> 01:04:55,000
- This fella John Dolan called me like you suggested.

1197
01:04:55,033 --> 01:04:56,766
- Like I suggested?

1198
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,900
- Yeah, he threw a shindigs at the college auditorium.

1199
01:04:58,933 --> 01:05:00,700
He sells seats for 10 bucks, raises money

1200
01:05:00,733 --> 01:05:03,500
for widows and orphans of dead police, sheriffs, deputies.

1201
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:06,200
He wants to give Bob,

1202
01:05:06,233 --> 01:05:09,033
Thurgood Marshall Jurist of the Year Award.

1203
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,700
Pretty great honor, don't you think?

1204
01:05:11,733 --> 01:05:12,533
- Yeah.

1205
01:05:13,366 --> 01:05:16,066
- With $10,000 cash prize.

1206
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,366
- Let me ask you this.

1207
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,633
Ms. Golina, how many seats do you figure's

1208
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,966
in that college auditorium?

1209
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,600
- Well, without counting I'd say about 600.

1210
01:05:25,633 --> 01:05:29,000
- 600 to $10 a ticket, that's $6,000.

1211
01:05:29,033 --> 01:05:30,666
- Yes. And we get half of that

1212
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,900
for the widows and orphans by contract.

1213
01:05:32,933 --> 01:05:34,400
- Okay, 3,000.

1214
01:05:34,433 --> 01:05:39,000
Now of the $3,000 that's left, Bob gets 10?

1215
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:42,200
I don't know much about throwing benefits,

1216
01:05:42,233 --> 01:05:45,400
but something stinks here, I can tell you that.

1217
01:05:45,433 --> 01:05:46,800
- I never thought of that.

1218
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,266
You're right, I'll tell him No.

1219
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,033
- You don't like John very much do you?

1220
01:05:56,066 --> 01:05:58,866
- Well, honey, I've been trying for 15 years

1221
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:02,200
not to like him, but I just can't help myself.

1222
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:06,133
John Dolan's not an easy man to dislike,

1223
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,000
maybe that's why he's such a good

1224
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:11,033
hustler.

1225
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:16,633
(upbeat music)

1226
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:41,233
(instrumental music)

1227
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:44,033
- You got the job done?

1228
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:46,566
- The nuclear power rods are at the bottom of the pool.

1229
01:06:53,133 --> 01:06:56,433
- Yeah, borrowed CIA duty station.

1230
01:06:56,466 --> 01:06:58,700
This place sure brings back some memories.

1231
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:03,500
Man, we sure had some good times back then, didn't we?

1232
01:07:04,633 --> 01:07:05,900
It sure was a good life

1233
01:07:05,933 --> 01:07:08,233
til you decided to hit the chicken switch.

1234
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,400
- You dated innocent co-eds

1235
01:07:10,433 --> 01:07:13,033
and killed them for kicks, like Sharon Hernandez.

1236
01:07:13,066 --> 01:07:15,366
You were hitting a lot of soft targets back then, Evan.

1237
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,533
- I don't need a high culatta,

1238
01:07:18,566 --> 01:07:20,866
not from a guy who's selling out his country

1239
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,833
to a bunch of terrorists

1240
01:07:22,866 --> 01:07:26,133
'Cause the agency is cutting back and he's out.

1241
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:27,433
- We need to get the merchandise

1242
01:07:27,466 --> 01:07:30,400
out of San Diego by this time tomorrow.

1243
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:35,333
Take care of these people before you go.

1244
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:47,100
- I'll do this first guy, Chance Wayne, just for fun.

1245
01:07:47,133 --> 01:07:48,766
He's on my unfinished business list.

1246
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,866
But these other two, I don't know, why them?

1247
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,566
- They're retired cops.

1248
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,833
But they're a lot sharper than the guys I've got.

1249
01:07:56,866 --> 01:07:58,566
If we leave them on the board, they'll figure it out.

1250
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,900
- There's always a need for covert ops.

1251
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:05,300
Sometimes I think the reason I was put on this earth

1252
01:08:05,333 --> 01:08:08,533
was to float the guys that figured out what you were up to.

1253
01:08:10,033 --> 01:08:13,133
(instrumental music)

1254
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,300
- I'm sorry, Ann, I didn't mean to get him hurt.

1255
01:08:50,566 --> 01:08:53,433
- You two, you're like old greyhounds at the dog track.

1256
01:08:53,466 --> 01:08:55,833
Here comes the rabbit, you've gotta run.

1257
01:08:55,866 --> 01:08:56,833
It's in your blood.

1258
01:08:59,033 --> 01:09:01,766
(door bell rings)

1259
01:09:07,766 --> 01:09:08,900
Hi, Moch.

1260
01:09:08,933 --> 01:09:10,133
- Hi Annie.

1261
01:09:10,166 --> 01:09:13,033
Meet JoJo Golina, assistant US Attorney.

1262
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,500
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1263
01:09:14,533 --> 01:09:16,166
- Is Bob away?

1264
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,933
- He's in the living room taking his blood pressure,

1265
01:09:17,966 --> 01:09:19,700
what's left to measure.

1266
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:21,300
Come on in. - After you.

1267
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,900
- Judge, how are you feeling?

1268
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,600
- I don't know whether to root for this to go up or down.

1269
01:09:35,633 --> 01:09:37,066
Have a seat, Ms. Golina.

1270
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:41,666
- Bob, we've got a big hit off the Federal computer guys.

1271
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:45,233
The blade to take down Hector was a linoleum knife.

1272
01:09:45,266 --> 01:09:48,300
Now, there were killings in five other places

1273
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:50,433
where the victim was taken down from behind

1274
01:09:50,466 --> 01:09:52,266
with a linoleum knife.

1275
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,800
- You check on those towns military bases?

1276
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:59,266
- Yeah, CIA has duty stations at each of those towns.

1277
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,866
I'm beginning to think our killer

1278
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,366
is some government nutcase.

1279
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,533
- The duty station in San Diego, where is it?

1280
01:10:05,566 --> 01:10:08,966
- It used to be on the Pacific Southwest University campus,

1281
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,100
but they closed now for a couple of years.

1282
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,666
- Use your phone, Bob?

1283
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,233
- Yeah, go ahead. - Thank you.

1284
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:19,200
- How about this guy, Jim Cross?

1285
01:10:19,233 --> 01:10:20,700
They found him dead this morning.

1286
01:10:20,733 --> 01:10:24,000
You showed me a picture of him with Evan Long.

1287
01:10:24,033 --> 01:10:25,733
Now he's got to fit in somewhere.

1288
01:10:25,766 --> 01:10:28,933
- Yeah. And here's another unanswered question.

1289
01:10:28,966 --> 01:10:30,900
What was really in that dairy container?

1290
01:10:30,933 --> 01:10:33,266
- I'm certain It was a federal payroll.

1291
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,600
They ship federal receipts by rail all the time.

1292
01:10:35,633 --> 01:10:39,000
- I don't think so, my gut says that's wrong.

1293
01:10:39,033 --> 01:10:40,733
This doesn't make any sense.

1294
01:10:40,766 --> 01:10:44,033
I just wish the hell, we knew where this house was.

1295
01:10:44,066 --> 01:10:47,300
Maybe we can rent a helicopter and look for it from the air.

1296
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:49,066
- I gotta run to the county jail, guys

1297
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,733
where they're holding this serial rapist

1298
01:10:51,766 --> 01:10:52,966
for me to interview.

1299
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,300
See I've been working on this paper

1300
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,266
and they're gonna transfer him in the morning.

1301
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:56,800
So somebody give me ride.

1302
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:58,266
- We're on our way.

1303
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,800
Hope you feel better, Bobby.

1304
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,633
- Here comes a rabbit.

1305
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:08,766
(instrumental music)

1306
01:11:12,066 --> 01:11:13,566
Sweetheart, I... they...

1307
01:11:16,466 --> 01:11:17,833
I'll be all right.

1308
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,366
- Greyhounds.

1309
01:11:33,933 --> 01:11:35,533
- Hi. - Hello, there.

1310
01:11:35,566 --> 01:11:36,900
- I'm Dr. Mochizuki.

1311
01:11:37,866 --> 01:11:39,033
I'm here to interview,

1312
01:11:41,633 --> 01:11:42,400
prisoner 36892.

1313
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,466
- We have a problem in the holding cell.

1314
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,900
I called one of ours but I'm afraid it maybe too late.

1315
01:11:48,933 --> 01:11:50,100
I'm a psychiatrist.

1316
01:11:50,133 --> 01:11:51,433
We do have to go through medical school.

1317
01:11:51,466 --> 01:11:53,433
Maybe I could just look at him for you.

1318
01:11:53,466 --> 01:11:55,066
- That'd be great.

1319
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,433
I don't know what I would do if you hadn't come.

1320
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,866
- Do you always wear high heels?

1321
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,366
- You're cute.

1322
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,200
- I know.

1323
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,133
- At first, I just thought he was drunk.

1324
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:12,333
He was running a fever.

1325
01:12:14,566 --> 01:12:15,433
Excuse me, fellas.

1326
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:21,700
His name is Jesus.

1327
01:12:29,033 --> 01:12:30,133
- Ola, Jesus.

1328
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,600
- What do you think it is?

1329
01:12:34,633 --> 01:12:36,566
- You get this man an ambulance,

1330
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,733
radiation therapy right to the hospital

1331
01:12:38,766 --> 01:12:41,066
and you alert the hospital that he's coming.

1332
01:12:43,733 --> 01:12:45,933
Where did you get these burns?

1333
01:12:45,966 --> 01:12:49,066
(instrumental music)

1334
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,733
Whatever was in there is radioactive.

1335
01:13:09,533 --> 01:13:11,900
- Let's put this together radioactive material,

1336
01:13:11,933 --> 01:13:15,400
Jim Cross, from water and power, Evan Long and Hector.

1337
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:17,466
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1338
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:20,266
A nuclear power plant at San Onofre has a breeder reactor.

1339
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,233
- Right, and Evan Long is a spy.

1340
01:13:22,266 --> 01:13:24,900
Now ,he could be selling it to a terrorist or to any country

1341
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:27,833
that was trying to develop a nuclear weapons program.

1342
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:29,366
Did Jesus say where the house was

1343
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,433
where they dropped the canister?

1344
01:13:30,466 --> 01:13:33,033
- Rancho la Loma, house at the top of the hill.

1345
01:13:33,066 --> 01:13:33,866
- Let's go.

1346
01:13:48,066 --> 01:13:48,866
- That's it.

1347
01:13:49,966 --> 01:13:51,500
So what you got?

1348
01:13:51,533 --> 01:13:53,633
- I love it, I love it.

1349
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:57,133
I'm on parole, you asked me to commit a felony trespass?

1350
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:59,233
No, thank you, no, way to go, John.

1351
01:13:59,266 --> 01:14:00,033
Just

1352
01:14:00,066 --> 01:14:01,300
what you got?

1353
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:03,700
- If you want an award just give yourself one.

1354
01:14:03,733 --> 01:14:04,533
Are we gonna get in or not?

1355
01:14:04,566 --> 01:14:06,266
- Hey, hey, hey,

1356
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,533
that's another bone I gotta pick with you guys.

1357
01:14:10,066 --> 01:14:11,766
Elmer says he's not gonna let me have that benefit

1358
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,366
unless you guys have a change of heart.

1359
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,733
What's that?

1360
01:14:14,766 --> 01:14:17,466
Have you ever looked an orphan in the eye, Chance

1361
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,500
and had to say, no?

1362
01:14:19,533 --> 01:14:22,033
- Man, you are really tough ride?

1363
01:14:22,066 --> 01:14:24,866
Just tell me, can we get in without setting off alarms?

1364
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:26,466
- Not unless you got wings, brother.

1365
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,533
Security is really tight.

1366
01:14:28,566 --> 01:14:30,333
I couldn't get close to the pool.

1367
01:14:30,366 --> 01:14:32,433
The heater to the pool was turned off though.

1368
01:14:32,466 --> 01:14:35,400
Laser trap set everywhere, ardent resonant cameras.

1369
01:14:35,433 --> 01:14:37,433
It's definitely a go next door as.

1370
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,333
- John, you're talking real current stuff there.

1371
01:14:43,333 --> 01:14:44,800
- The past year my cellmate was

1372
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,366
a very hip jewel thief.

1373
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,566
And we did have a lot of time to talk.

1374
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,666
- Bob, too much, Moch was right.

1375
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:56,666
You and JoJo better go so on move fast.

1376
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,800
They shut off the heater to the pool

1377
01:14:57,833 --> 01:14:59,400
and that's probably where it's at.

1378
01:14:59,433 --> 01:15:02,466
And bring Sheriff Elmer Whitaker with you, thanks.

1379
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:03,666
- What's in the pool?

1380
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:06,266
And what's going on here, Chance?

1381
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,633
Hey, I wanna go home, man.

1382
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:08,700
- Eat a sandwich.

1383
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:11,233
- Cucumber on whole wheat.

1384
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,666
Man, you really don't want to live, don't you?

1385
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:16,700
- We're talking seven grain, John.

1386
01:15:18,466 --> 01:15:19,466
- All right.

1387
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,000
- I think I'll stay here.

1388
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:35,433
My hand shakes when I see people get arrested.

1389
01:15:35,466 --> 01:15:36,733
Nobody invited you.

1390
01:15:36,766 --> 01:15:37,666
What is he doing?

1391
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,700
- Had him case the place.

1392
01:15:38,733 --> 01:15:40,700
- Chance, your memory is worse than I thought.

1393
01:15:40,733 --> 01:15:42,600
Have you forgotten this guy steals?

1394
01:15:50,533 --> 01:15:52,133
- We got company, front gate.

1395
01:15:53,533 --> 01:15:54,533
What is it?

1396
01:15:54,566 --> 01:15:56,766
- Sheriff's office, we'd like to come in.

1397
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,466
You mind opening this gate?

1398
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,433
- Sorry.

1399
01:16:01,466 --> 01:16:03,566
- We got us a warrant, now open the gate.

1400
01:16:12,966 --> 01:16:13,866
- Gentlemen.

1401
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,100
Ma'am.

1402
01:16:19,466 --> 01:16:21,700
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Long.

1403
01:16:21,733 --> 01:16:24,133
- I don't think I know you.

1404
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:25,733
- Is that Evan Long?

1405
01:16:25,766 --> 01:16:27,566
- Sure is.

1406
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,366
- Mr. Long, you're under arrest.

1407
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,733
That's a federal warrant.

1408
01:16:32,733 --> 01:16:34,466
- Mi casa su casa.

1409
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,600
Open the gate.

1410
01:16:37,766 --> 01:16:39,300
Come on in folks.

1411
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:40,666
- I'll take that.

1412
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,633
- Hands behind your back.

1413
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:44,066
- Let's check the pool.

1414
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,533
- Move.

1415
01:16:45,566 --> 01:16:47,233
- This is a case of mistaken identity.

1416
01:16:47,266 --> 01:16:49,133
My name is not Evan Long,

1417
01:16:50,266 --> 01:16:51,700
it's Charles Watkins.

1418
01:16:51,733 --> 01:16:54,166
- We'll deal with that downtown once we check your prints.

1419
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,733
- What is it you think you're gonna find back here?

1420
01:16:56,766 --> 01:16:58,500
- Canisters with used power rod center

1421
01:16:58,533 --> 01:16:59,833
from the water and power company.

1422
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:02,200
That's what stole you stole-- (Evan laughs)

1423
01:17:02,233 --> 01:17:04,866
- That's one vivid imagination you got there, sir.

1424
01:17:06,866 --> 01:17:07,666
- That canister's gotta be cracked,

1425
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:09,166
this whole area's hot.

1426
01:17:10,733 --> 01:17:11,733
There it is.

1427
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:19,833
Guys, this stuff is nuclear grade plutonium.

1428
01:17:19,866 --> 01:17:22,300
You could make a nuclear weapon out of it.

1429
01:17:24,833 --> 01:17:26,966
- Hold it right there, put your hands up.

1430
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,833
Throw your weapons into the pool.

1431
01:17:29,766 --> 01:17:31,600
(gun shot)

1432
01:17:31,633 --> 01:17:33,300
- Come on, get my cuffs off.

1433
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:36,933
- It's not a suggestion drop them.

1434
01:17:36,966 --> 01:17:38,833
- Guess we know why you came down from Washington

1435
01:17:38,866 --> 01:17:40,866
now, don't we, Mr. Glass?

1436
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,766
- Take Ms. Golina put her out in the van

1437
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,066
with the rest of them.

1438
01:17:45,366 --> 01:17:47,500
- Get up, come on, get up!

1439
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,733
Get going, come on, move.

1440
01:17:53,466 --> 01:17:54,766
- I hate to think my life's come down

1441
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,300
to whether John Dolan's paying attention.

1442
01:17:57,333 --> 01:18:00,433
(instrumental music)

1443
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,400
- Damn.

1444
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,733
(instrumental music)

1445
01:18:34,166 --> 01:18:35,366
- I hate this.

1446
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,000
Way out of character, John.

1447
01:18:38,033 --> 01:18:41,133
(instrumental music)

1448
01:18:53,733 --> 01:18:54,933
- You guys are the insurance policy,

1449
01:18:54,966 --> 01:18:56,833
anything goes wrong in a light you up.

1450
01:19:14,266 --> 01:19:17,400
- Well, this is not working out the way I planned.

1451
01:19:24,433 --> 01:19:26,466
- Well, it's been an hour.

1452
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,033
We're in deep soup here.

1453
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:30,333
I'm sorry, fellows.

1454
01:19:31,966 --> 01:19:33,900
Maybe the boy was right, maybe we should have

1455
01:19:33,933 --> 01:19:36,766
just found the bench somewhere.

1456
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,900
- We really went down hard.

1457
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,900
The old days we would have done a whole lot better.

1458
01:19:41,933 --> 01:19:43,200
- Who are you kidding?

1459
01:19:43,233 --> 01:19:45,233
In the old days, you would never that good.

1460
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,000
I can get you out.

1461
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:49,400
But first, you gotta tell Elmer down there,

1462
01:19:49,433 --> 01:19:51,533
it's okay for me to have my benefit

1463
01:19:51,566 --> 01:19:52,566
- Benefit?

1464
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,633
You mean you're gonna sit there

1465
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:55,000
and try to cut a deal with us.

1466
01:19:55,033 --> 01:19:57,700
- I'm trying to help out the widows and the orphans

1467
01:19:57,733 --> 01:20:01,166
and I'm being scrutinized for this by you two old fools

1468
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,033
as if I was trying to sell Florida swamp land

1469
01:20:03,066 --> 01:20:04,133
or something, come on.

1470
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:04,933
- Jonathan.

1471
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:06,566
- Yes, Chancey.

1472
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,933
- You get us out of here and I will not only see to it,

1473
01:20:08,966 --> 01:20:10,800
that you get your benefit,

1474
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:13,266
but I'll agree to be the guest of honor.

1475
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:16,200
I'm sorry, Chance but it's a little late for that now.

1476
01:20:16,233 --> 01:20:17,766
I already printed up the program.

1477
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,700
Now we gotta get Bob to accept the Thurgood Marshall

1478
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:22,833
distinguished jurist award.

1479
01:20:22,866 --> 01:20:24,200
- Bob accepts.

1480
01:20:24,233 --> 01:20:25,833
- No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't wanna be a part of that.

1481
01:20:25,866 --> 01:20:28,600
- Bob, you accept, let's go.

1482
01:20:28,633 --> 01:20:29,433
- Bob?

1483
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,533
Now we're talking.

1484
01:20:34,566 --> 01:20:37,366
Here, Chance take this, don't ask me where I got it.

1485
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,466
- Where'd you get it?

1486
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,700
This was in my apartment.

1487
01:20:39,733 --> 01:20:41,100
- Let's not quibble over details.

1488
01:20:41,133 --> 01:20:44,533
Now, take this rope, tie it to that door over there,

1489
01:20:44,566 --> 01:20:47,033
with a knot that won't slip and get out of the way.

1490
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,866
(instrumental music)

1491
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:01,800
(upbeat music)

1492
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:17,266
- Okay,

1493
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,466
let's see what you got, baby.

1494
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,933
(upbeat music)

1495
01:21:21,966 --> 01:21:24,533
(car screeches)

1496
01:21:39,066 --> 01:21:41,600
- Good afternoon, I'll take the piece

1497
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:46,366
- Where they taking that canister?

1498
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,133
- Answer.

1499
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,033
- To the private airfield at the Naval Station.

1500
01:21:51,066 --> 01:21:54,533
It's a big press event, food drive for Somalia.

1501
01:21:54,566 --> 01:21:55,800
- Give me that piece, Chance.

1502
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:56,900
I'll keep him covered.

1503
01:22:06,133 --> 01:22:07,000
- Thanks, John.

1504
01:22:09,533 --> 01:22:11,066
Those were under my bed.

1505
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,600
- There's no commentary into your sex life

1506
01:22:12,633 --> 01:22:14,166
- You broke into my house.

1507
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,400
- I'm pleading fifth on that.

1508
01:22:15,433 --> 01:22:17,100
Look at that, just like a John Ford movie.

1509
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:34,266
- Excuse me, where's Mr. And Mrs. Burke?

1510
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:36,566
I wanna interview them about the food drive.

1511
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:39,466
- They're not here, Mr. Burke fell ill.

1512
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:40,366
- What?

1513
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,300
- Can you tell us more about it?

1514
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:42,200
- Look, there's hungry children

1515
01:22:42,233 --> 01:22:43,433
who need this food, excuse me.

1516
01:22:43,466 --> 01:22:44,933
- Is that all you could--

1517
01:22:44,966 --> 01:22:46,333
Come on, let's keep it rolling.

1518
01:22:46,366 --> 01:22:48,700
They're loading, maybe get it of the plane taking off

1519
01:23:05,266 --> 01:23:07,066
- [Male Speaker] Tower, this is November four, six, one

1520
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:10,000
Charlie Alpha, flight three for Somalia,

1521
01:23:10,033 --> 01:23:12,200
requesting clearance for immediate takeoff.

1522
01:23:14,466 --> 01:23:16,033
- [Male Speaker] One Charlie Alpha,

1523
01:23:16,066 --> 01:23:19,166
you're cleared via taxiway seven, two, runway one, five.

1524
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,000
- [Male Speaker] One Charlie Alpha,

1525
01:23:24,033 --> 01:23:26,300
roger taxiing the runway one, five.

1526
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:28,966
(plane roars)

1527
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:41,866
- They must be using the food drive to smuggle

1528
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:43,766
the nuclear power rods out of the country.

1529
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,100
That's gotta be it.

1530
01:23:45,133 --> 01:23:47,566
(upbeat music)

1531
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,133
- [Male Speaker] Tower one Charlie Alpha

1532
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:52,200
request straight off departure from runway one, five.

1533
01:23:52,233 --> 01:23:54,133
- [Male Speaker] One Charlie Alpha standby.

1534
01:23:57,033 --> 01:24:00,266
(upbeat music)

1535
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:02,000
- You're cleared for takeoff.

1536
01:24:02,033 --> 01:24:03,666
- [Male Speaker] One Charlie Alpha, roger.

1537
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:08,200
- If it gets airborne, knock it down.

1538
01:24:08,233 --> 01:24:09,666
Aim for the engine.

1539
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:11,033
- If we knock it down, we're gonna have

1540
01:24:11,066 --> 01:24:13,033
high grade plutonium all over the field.

1541
01:24:13,066 --> 01:24:15,766
- Yeah, this whole area is gonna be hot for 200 years.

1542
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:19,233
(upbeat music)

1543
01:24:19,266 --> 01:24:21,900
- Moch, you got my glasses, these old ones seem like a hoot.

1544
01:24:21,933 --> 01:24:22,733
- Yeah.

1545
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:25,233
(upbeat music)

1546
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,133
(gun shot)

1547
01:24:42,166 --> 01:24:45,000
(tires screech)

1548
01:24:58,833 --> 01:25:01,800
(gun shots)

1549
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:04,333
(upbeat music)

1550
01:25:32,666 --> 01:25:34,066
- Drop the gun.

1551
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:39,966
You're under arrest for the murder

1552
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,333
of Sharon and Hector Hernandez.

1553
01:25:41,366 --> 01:25:44,100
- What if I don't wanna be arrested old man?

1554
01:25:44,133 --> 01:25:46,700
- Then I'm gonna put you in another category.

1555
01:25:47,666 --> 01:25:50,100
(gun shots)

1556
01:25:52,266 --> 01:25:53,300
- Hold it.

1557
01:25:56,433 --> 01:26:00,333
Get your hands behind your back, get them back here.

1558
01:26:00,366 --> 01:26:01,300
- Chance.

1559
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:05,033
Damn,

1560
01:26:05,066 --> 01:26:05,866
look at that.

1561
01:26:09,433 --> 01:26:10,666
- You okay?

1562
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,900
- It hurts worse that I remember it.

1563
01:26:16,666 --> 01:26:19,700
(laughter)

1564
01:26:19,733 --> 01:26:22,866
(instrumental music)

1565
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,233
- Think, that's the secret, think.

1566
01:26:26,266 --> 01:26:27,566
Use your head.

1567
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,066
I wondered why the Siamese twins moved to London

1568
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:31,700
till I realized probably that the other one

1569
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:33,300
wanted to drive for a while.

1570
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,766
Think, why would a Japanese kamikaze pilot

1571
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,766
even bother to put on his helmet?

1572
01:26:41,966 --> 01:26:44,900
Think, you would never say to an older man,

1573
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:46,333
no hard feelings.

1574
01:26:46,366 --> 01:26:47,500
You wouldn't say that.

1575
01:26:47,533 --> 01:26:49,266
- Not much of a turn out.

1576
01:26:51,233 --> 01:26:52,566
- Well, I don't want the money or the plaque.

1577
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,333
I wanna know what this guy is up to.

1578
01:26:54,366 --> 01:26:55,766
I just can't figure it out.

1579
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,966
Now, he gave $3,000 to Elmer

1580
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,933
for the widows and orphans fund.

1581
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:04,266
There's 16 people out there plus a few old friends.

1582
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,100
How's he making money, I don't get it.

1583
01:27:06,133 --> 01:27:07,233
- Beats the hell out of me.

1584
01:27:07,266 --> 01:27:09,333
- Showtime, showtime.

1585
01:27:09,366 --> 01:27:10,966
Now just keep the speech short.

1586
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,400
I like to keep things moving, okay?

1587
01:27:13,433 --> 01:27:15,633
- We wouldn't wanna bore those 20 people out there.

1588
01:27:17,133 --> 01:27:19,566
- Just remember, friend, when you go to court

1589
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,933
in front of a jury, you are putting your faith in the hands

1590
01:27:22,966 --> 01:27:25,000
of 12 people who weren't smart enough

1591
01:27:25,033 --> 01:27:27,166
to get out of jury duty.

1592
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,500
Thank you very much.

1593
01:27:28,533 --> 01:27:31,600
(audience applauds)

1594
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:35,500
- Right now it's time to meet the man who is responsible

1595
01:27:35,533 --> 01:27:38,133
for putting all these great benefits together,

1596
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:40,666
Mr. Jonathan Wingate Dolan.

1597
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:43,700
(audience applauds)

1598
01:27:53,333 --> 01:27:54,600
- Thank you, thank you.

1599
01:27:54,633 --> 01:27:57,266
And now the highlight of the evening,

1600
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:01,366
the Judge Thurgood Marshall Award for distinguished jurist,

1601
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:04,933
goes to Judge Robert Smith retired.

1602
01:28:04,966 --> 01:28:07,233
Come out, judge get your check and your plaque

1603
01:28:07,266 --> 01:28:08,533
and say a few words.

1604
01:28:09,433 --> 01:28:12,566
(audience applauds)

1605
01:28:15,266 --> 01:28:16,666
- Make it brief, they're fading.

1606
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:17,733
- How can you tell?

1607
01:28:43,366 --> 01:28:47,700
- Thanks.

1608
01:28:47,733 --> 01:28:50,733
(audience applauds)

1609
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:53,466
- Great speech, Bob

1610
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,700
A little short but just clogged with emotion.

1611
01:28:56,733 --> 01:28:58,300
- Right.

1612
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,533
- [John] Thank you Judge, that was absolutely adequate.

1613
01:28:59,566 --> 01:29:01,000
And thank you, folks, for being with us.

1614
01:29:01,033 --> 01:29:03,500
That winds up our program and good night and God--

1615
01:29:03,533 --> 01:29:05,733
- Would you believe it, $10,000?

1616
01:29:07,433 --> 01:29:09,266
- I don't know, we can hope it bounces

1617
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:11,400
and we can get him for hanging paper.

1618
01:29:11,433 --> 01:29:14,466
- It's not gonna bounce, I'm not that lucky.

1619
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,733
Why don't you take it and

1620
01:29:15,766 --> 01:29:17,200
give it to the people it's intended for

1621
01:29:17,233 --> 01:29:19,733
Which is the children of dead policemen.

1622
01:29:19,766 --> 01:29:22,433
- Well, that's very noble of you, Bob.

1623
01:29:22,466 --> 01:29:25,266
But you still got your plaque.

1624
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:28,433
(instrumental music)

1625
01:29:32,933 --> 01:29:35,366
Finally, got you some justice, Hernie.

1626
01:29:37,266 --> 01:29:38,166
Rest in peace.

1627
01:29:38,933 --> 01:29:42,066
(instrumental music)

1628
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:56,033
What happened to my keys?

1629
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,933
- There they are.

1630
01:29:59,966 --> 01:30:02,200
- I don't remember putting them there, now.

1631
01:30:02,233 --> 01:30:04,400
- Want these, you left them at the office last night.

1632
01:30:04,433 --> 01:30:05,766
- I did?

1633
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,166
- If you hadn't left us watching the car, Chancey,

1634
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,733
you'd probably misplaced it too. (laughs)

1635
01:30:10,766 --> 01:30:11,900
- Ah.

1636
01:30:11,933 --> 01:30:12,733
- What?

1637
01:30:13,566 --> 01:30:14,466
- I know how you do it.

1638
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,866
I just figured it out.

1639
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:17,233
- Do what?

1640
01:30:17,266 --> 01:30:21,566
Making money on those corny PBL benefits.

1641
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,600
- Widows and the children get the money. Chance.

1642
01:30:24,633 --> 01:30:26,633
- You oversold the house.

1643
01:30:26,666 --> 01:30:28,800
- I oversold the house, it would have been a riot--

1644
01:30:28,833 --> 01:30:30,166
- No, no, no, no, no

1645
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:32,100
no, riots, no, riots,

1646
01:30:32,133 --> 01:30:36,666
'cause nobody goes to a policeman's benefit, huh, Moch?

1647
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:37,733
- Nobody.

1648
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:38,933
- Bob?

1649
01:30:38,966 --> 01:30:40,533
- Well, me and the wife, we go every year.

1650
01:30:40,566 --> 01:30:42,800
- I'm talking about the average person, Bob.

1651
01:30:42,833 --> 01:30:45,266
They just buy the ticket, they throw them away.

1652
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:47,700
And you could have sold 10,000 of them

1653
01:30:47,733 --> 01:30:51,433
and you still wouldn't have filled the house, huh?

1654
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:55,533
- There is no law against that, is there?

1655
01:30:55,566 --> 01:30:57,233
- It isn't a question of the law, man.

1656
01:30:57,266 --> 01:31:00,700
It's a question of integrity, is nothing sacred?

1657
01:31:00,733 --> 01:31:02,733
What's next, wooden nickels?

1658
01:31:02,766 --> 01:31:05,033
(laughter)

1659
01:31:05,066 --> 01:31:07,633
(talking over each other)

1660
01:31:07,666 --> 01:31:09,533
- You guys gotta get a life, you know that?

1661
01:31:09,566 --> 01:31:12,033
(upbeat music)
