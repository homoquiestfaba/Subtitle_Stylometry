So it's steak,
huh?

1260
01:05:11,888 --> 01:05:13,480
Yeah.

1261
01:05:13,523 --> 01:05:16,458
Travis needs his strength
for the fight tomorrow night.

1262
01:05:16,492 --> 01:05:18,016
Well, it's lucky
somebody picks up

1263
01:05:18,061 --> 01:05:20,962
an occasional shift at the mill
so we can afford steak.

1264
01:05:23,433 --> 01:05:24,457
You know, I'd be...

1265
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,525
[throat clears]
I'd be nervous to watch,

1266
01:05:26,569 --> 01:05:29,436
but maybe if...
if you took me,

1267
01:05:29,472 --> 01:05:32,839
I could close my eyes
at the bad parts.

1268
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:36,106
It would be nice
if we were there when he wins.

1269
01:05:36,145 --> 01:05:37,669
That's if he wins.

1270
01:05:37,714 --> 01:05:40,649
Oh,
he's gonna win.

1271
01:05:40,683 --> 01:05:43,117
Well, he didn't win
last time.

1272
01:05:43,152 --> 01:05:45,416
Besides, mill called
about a shift tomorrow night,

1273
01:05:45,455 --> 01:05:49,016
and we need the money,
what with eatin' steak and all.

Just forget
the bastard, Travis.

1277
01:06:35,171 --> 01:06:37,503
He treats you
and your mom like dogs.

1278
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:38,871
He wants me to lose.

1279
01:06:38,908 --> 01:06:41,138
You are not
gonna lose.

1280
01:06:41,177 --> 01:06:43,372
You are gonna win,

1281
01:06:43,413 --> 01:06:48,180
and we're going to Vegas
to have a life together.

1282
01:06:48,217 --> 01:06:51,345
You can do it.

1283
01:06:51,387 --> 01:06:53,787
We can get out
of this shithole.

1284
01:06:59,295 --> 01:07:00,887
That is
what you want...

isn't it?

1286
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:08,867
Yeah, but Jacko is...

1287
01:07:08,905 --> 01:07:10,065
Jacko's a loser.

1288
01:07:10,106 --> 01:07:12,131
He always will be.

1289

Do not let him
drag you down.

1290
01:07:15,078 --> 01:07:17,205
He's my friend.

1291
01:07:17,246 --> 01:07:19,339
If he was
your friend,

1292
01:07:19,382 --> 01:07:22,180
he would want
what's best for you,

1293
01:07:22,218 --> 01:07:23,742
which is us,

to come, Annie.

1297

I mean, you know
it's all we ever talked about

1298
01:07:35,465 --> 01:07:37,433
since we were kids.

1299
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:40,868
Well, you're
not kids anymore.

1300
01:07:40,903 --> 01:07:43,030
Let him get
his own place.

1301
01:07:45,842 --> 01:07:47,833
You need
to be with me.

1302

Annie, I can't.

1303
01:07:55,618 --> 01:07:56,607

No, talk to Jacko,
all right?

1306
01:08:09,499 --> 01:08:11,865
And tell him about us?

1307
01:08:14,203 --> 01:08:16,899
Yeah.

Don't come to the fight,
okay, Annie?

1311
01:08:26,783 --> 01:08:30,583
Just stay home,
and I'll come right after.

01:17:36,465 --> 01:17:37,432
we'd find him, you know?

1425
01:17:37,466 --> 01:17:38,728
So then I get
in the ring, right?

1426
01:17:38,767 --> 01:17:41,895
And I'm all charged up to kill
this fuckin' Sangster guy.

1427
01:17:41,937 --> 01:17:42,904
Takes off his hood.

1428
01:17:42,938 --> 01:17:44,200
It's the same
fuckin' faggot

1429

<i>Right, and you know how</i>
<i>I like to get in there, right?</i>

1433
01:17:50,379 --> 01:17:52,074
Control the fight
from the beginning,

1434
01:17:52,114 --> 01:17:53,581
go right into
the fuckin' clinch.

1435
01:17:53,615 --> 01:17:54,912
Only this guy wants that.

1436
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:56,542
Well, you didn't
want that, right?

1437
01:17:56,585 --> 01:17:59,076
No, man, I was doing everything
I could to fuckin', you know,

1438
01:17:59,121 --> 01:18:00,213
stay away from this queer.

1439
01:18:00,255 --> 01:18:02,280
But you got him in the clinch,
didn't you?

1440
01:18:02,324 --> 01:18:05,088

How do you know he loved it?

1446
01:18:13,235 --> 01:18:16,261
Well, he was fuckin'
holding me, man,

1447
01:18:16,305 --> 01:18:18,205

Are you saying that he got

1453
01:18:25,247 --> 01:18:26,771
the fuckin' hard-on
in the clinch?

1454
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,782
<i>Yeah, man, he did.</i>

1455
01:18:27,816 --> 01:18:28,976
He fuckin' did, right?

1456
01:18:29,018 --> 01:18:30,645
