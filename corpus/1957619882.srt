Look at my masterpiece.

8
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,893
I can put any face on it I want.

00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,361
Governor--

10
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,997
The governor is dead, as
required by our contract.

11
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:31,965
It was a perfect
duplicate of Connie.

12
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,567
It was perfect.

13
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,936
You can assassinate any world
leader, anywhere on the globe,

14
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,338
at any time.

15
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:38,172
NARRATOR:

16
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,007
Jesus Christ, it's you Eric.

NARRATOR: The inventor's
program is genius.

18
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,347
Police pursue the innocent--

[blasts]

20
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,786
--while they pursue profit.

21
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,656
The advanced cybertechnology
made us millionaires.

22
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,025
NARRATOR: But their
formula for success

23
00:00:58,126 --> 00:01:00,461
does not allow for error.

24
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,364
[blast]

25
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:07,034

27
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,675
You are to be executed now.

00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,444
An army couldn't stop it.

29
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,379
We're not going to be
able to shake this thing.

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,549
[blast]

31
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:27,087
You might kill a president,
or a king, or a prime minister.

32
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:28,556
He's going to be famous.

33
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,124
NARRATOR: But their
immediate target--

00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,692
[gunshots]

35
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,294

[blasts]

45
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:19,139
Someone's trying to trace our
tap into the police cyberbase.

46
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,542
But there's evidence
of our operation there.

47
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,943
I think I've got
enough information.

48
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,111
He's too close.

49
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:25,846
Somebody's got
to listen to me.

50
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,248
