* C-notes, C-notes,
gotta have cash *

00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,500
* Drink the whole fifth down
by the shot glass... *

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,000
 <i>Mira que fresca que tu eres</i>

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,400
 <i>con esos zapatos tan lindos!</i>

5
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,100
 <i>Minamahal Kite.</i>

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,600
 <i>Iniibig kita.</i>

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,700
Hey!

8
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,400
 <i>Head er dit problem?!</i>

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Vic's name is Amos Delaware.

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Got it off his Native American
tribal ID.

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,600
Apparently, he was chief
of the Montiquan 

12
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,700
Indian Nation.

13
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,400
Montiquans were one of the first
tribes to settle in Manhattan.

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
A real live native New Yorker.

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,500
Not anymore.

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,000
The guy just bumped
into us and then...

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,400
I saw him pull the gun out.

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,500
 <i>Entonces estaba caminando...</i>

19
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,200
That's the sexiest thing
I've ever heard.

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,900
Okay, guy why don't you
explain to me why you thought

21
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,800
it was a good idea to pull out
a loaded gun on a crowded train.

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Yeah, yeah, hang on.
Do me a favor.

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,500
Tell it to that, would you?

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,800
One minute the man

25
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,400
was sitting there,
the next he was dead.

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,200
Thanks.

27
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,900
Small caliber gunshot
wound to the abdomen.

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,000
Not much bigger than a .25.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,500
Yep, minimal blood loss,
no exit wound.

30
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,300
Well, that's because the bullet

31
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,500
was definitely fired
from the outside.

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
Come on, now.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
A shooter out there
to hit a guy in here

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,600
on a moving train?

35
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,500
Lebron James couldn't
hit that shot.

36
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,700
There's always that, uh,

37
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,000
last second
half-court shot

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,800
that somehow makes it in.

39
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,900
Question is:

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,000
Who fired it?

41

HAWK: Okay, so this is
the Number Seven line

49
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,500
approachg Woodside, Queens,
and according to the

50
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,700
Department of Transportation,
the track stretches

51
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,600
a little less than half
a mile between that station

52
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,100
and the previous stop,
which is 52nd and Lincoln.

53
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,600
And when you stack

54
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,700
what they're giving us
for rush hour train speed

55
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,000
against the witness
reports from the scene,

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,300
we can estimate
that the train

57
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,000
was traveling
approximately

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,600
32 miles an hour
at 9:26.

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,100
All right, then.

60
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,300
We know the vic was seated

61
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,200
in the last car
of a 10-car train.

62
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,900
Right, and based on
the position of his seat

63
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,600
and the bullet's impact
on the safety glass at 5'11"

64
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,700
from the floor,
 entered at roughly

65
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,900
a 70 degree angle.

66
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,300
HAWKES: Okay, so
assuming Mac's right

67
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,100
about a .25 caliber bullet,

68
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,200
we can plug in a
standard bullet speed

69
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,100
of 760 feet per second.

70
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,400
Trajectory angle of 70 degrees,

71
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,700
train velocity
32 miles per hr,

72
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,700
track distance 2,640 feet

73
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,600
and time...

74
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,400
9:26 A.M.

75
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,100
And then all we have to
do is run a simulation.

76
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,100
There, that's where
the bullet hit the train.

77
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,400
All right, good to go!

78
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,600
Bang.

79
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,500
NYPD.

80
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,300
I'd like to speak
with you, ma'am.

81
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,000
Can we come in, please?

82
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,700
Step back from the door,
please.

83
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,600
Did you hear any sort
of gunfire this morning?

84
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,200
DON'T TELL HIM ANYTING.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,700
GIRL: Sure he heard it.

86
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,700
He fired it.

87
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,400
Stop right there.

88
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,900
Don't move.

89
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
WE HAVE TO TELL HIM.

90
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,400
YOU BE QUIET!

91
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,000
No, I won't be quiet, Appa.

92
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
What happened?

93
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,500
Last night, my boyfriend
spent the night.

94
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,200
So, this morning,
my father tried to kill him.

95
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,400
You sleep with my daughter
before marriage?!

96
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Appa, Appa, stop it!

97
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
I love him, Appa, stop!

98
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,700
Was your boyfriend hit?

99
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,900
No, thank God. Why?

100
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,900
Someone else was.

101
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Turn around, sir.

102
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,000
You're under arrest for the
death of Amos Delaware.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,900
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

104
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,100
* The crows
brought the message *

105
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,300
* To the children of the sun 

106
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,000
* For the return
of the buffalo *

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,500
* And for a better day to come 

108
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,400
* You can kill my body 

109
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,400
* You can damn my soul 

110
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,000
* For not believing
in your god *

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,500
* And some world down below 

112
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,100
* But you don't stand a chance *

113
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,000
* Against my prayers 

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,700
* You don't stand a chance *

115
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,300
* Against my love 

116
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,700
* They outlawed
the Ghost Dance *

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,900
* They outlawed
the Ghost Dance *

118
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,100
* But we shall live again 

119
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,900
* We shl live again 

120
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,600
* We used tdo
the Ghost Dance *

121
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,600
* But we don't sing
them kinda songs no more. *

122
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,700
Dr. Hawkes.

123
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,000
Tell Mac not to go
to the D.A. just yet.

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,200
What do you mean he didn't
die from a gunshot wound?

125
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,600
Well, here, see foyourself.

126
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,600
Ooh, that's sepsis.

127
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,900
SID: And my blood
work confirms it.

128
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,700
Our victim was dying
for several days

129
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,900
before he finally expired
from acute bacterial

130
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,100
infection on that train.

131
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,300
Hang on, you're telling me

132
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,700
that a bullet managed to hit
the one man on a speeding train

133
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,900
who was already dead?
I know.

134
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,700
Worse odds than Atlantic City.

135
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,500
Yeah, but he looks like
he was in awfully good shape

136
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,900
to dierom natural causes--

137
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,500
bacterial or otherwise.

138
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,400
Well, as my Lithuanian
grandmother used to say,

139
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,900
 <i>"Kame rya sviesos,</i>
 <i>ten it seseliu esti."</i>

140
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,100
"Where there is light,
there must also be shadows."

141
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,700
Oh, she drove me nuts.

142
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,100
Anyway, I found several
small perforations

143
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
through the outer wall
of his small intestine.

144
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,900
See these around the jejunum?

145
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,600
Definitely would've
caused the sepsis.

146
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,100
Any external wounds?

147
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,200
Ase from these superficial
splinters I pulled

148
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,100
from a contusion
on his thigh,

149
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,500
not a one.

150
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,400
Maybe he swallowed something
without knowing it?

151
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,600
Well, if he did,
his esophagus

152
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,200
certainly shows
no sign of trauma.

153
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,000
And nothing turned up
 along his G.I. tract

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
on the X ray.
Come on, Sid.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,200
You gotta be blowing smoke here.

156
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,300
I wish I were.

157
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,700
But now that you mention it.

158
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,000
Check out his lung tissue.

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,100
It's rainbow colored.

160
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,200
Some kind of inhaled
particulate, I suppose.

161
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
And they both look the same.

162
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,100
Yeah, but that wouldn't
have caused his sepsis

163
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,500
any more than those splinters.

164
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,800
No.

165
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,600
But until I go digging through
the depths of his septic bowels,

166
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,900
I'm afraid all Ian tell
you is that, in my own gut,

167
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,400
his death doesn't feel
self-inflicted.

168
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,900
Is that your way
of asking for help?

169
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,900
Well, if there is
something in his body

170
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,900
too radiolucent
for an X ray to pick up

171
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,500
and you did decide to run

172
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,100
a high-res 3D-CT,

173
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,400
it would help save me
the extra time and trouble

174
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,500
of poking through 30 feet
of gastrointestinal tract.

175
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,100
I'll take that as a yes.

176
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm tracing the wounds
along his G.I. tract.

177
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,900
The wounds stop here.

178
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,800
You seeing what I'm seeing, Sid?

179
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,700
Uh... yeah.

180
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,800
Just below the descending colon.

181
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,500
Yeah, almost.

182
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,300
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

183
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,600
Okay.

184
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,100
Find anything?

185
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,400
Yeah.

186
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,500
But what the hell kind
of murder weapon is this?

187
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,000
What do you think
about the name Louie?

188
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,300
I think he's going
to grow up to be a bookie.

189
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,000
How about Clemenza?

190
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Influenza.

191
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,100
The kids on the playground
will call him a virus.

192
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,300
Ooh, easy.

193
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,100
Alfonse?

194
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,600
What'd you do, go through
the cast list of <i>Godfather II?</i>

195
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,100
No, these are names of
people in my family.

196
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,700
Messer.

197
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,200
All right.

198
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,600
Yeah, I'll be right there.

199
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,800
I got to go to the vic's
hotel room with Stella.

200
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,400
Listen, you got plenty of time
on this name search.

201
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,000
I mean,
the kid's not even here yet.

202
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,700
My mom and dad
waited six weeks

203
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,200
after I was born to name me.

204
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,600
Oh, they waited six weeks
to name you Sheldon?

205
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,900
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

206
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,000
No, that's cool.

207
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,600
That's a great name.

208
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,800
I'll see you later, Sheldon.

209
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400


215
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,900
This was his room?

216
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,700
Indeed, it was.

217
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,600
MESS:
Whoa, whoa.

218
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,100
What are they
doing here, buddy?

219
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,900
Their jobs.

220
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,100
Is that a problem?

221
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,200
Yes, actually, it is.

222
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,300
 <i>Seora,</i>

223
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,000
 <i>para, por favor,</i>

224
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,400
 <i>el limpiar para ahora.</i>

225
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,100
Uh, please, sir.

226
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,300
Don-Don't touch that.

227
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,900
But I have to pack
this stuff up.

228
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,100
Mr. Connover is
the hotel's

229
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,300
information technology
consultant.

230
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,500
The computer did not belong
to Mr. Delaware.

231
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,800
All the same, we'd like you
to leave everything

232
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,100
where it is right now
for the time being, thank you.

233
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,500
Thank you, Mr. Connover,
that will be all.

234
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,700
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Are you telling me this room is
some kind of crime scene?

236
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,200
We'll let you
know when we do.

237
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,100
Okay?
Thank you.

238
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
All right, so we know our
little black mystery pick

239
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,500
is what killed him.

240
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,700
He died on a rush hour train.

241
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,500
This could be
where he had his last meal.

242
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,100
Yeah, with all the traffic
coming through here

243
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,100
since then,
let's hope we're not too late.

244
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,400
This looks like some kind
of journal Amos was keeping.

245
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,200
Amos... Amos.

246
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,800
I like the name Amos.

247
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,400
I wonder if this writing is
Montiquan.

248
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,000
Amos...
Daniel...

249
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,800
Messer.

250
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,500
Danny, at some point,
you might want

251
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
to consider the
possibility that you

252
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
and Lindsay could have a girl.

253
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,400
My mom had two boys,
her mom had three boys.

254
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,300
I'm gonna have a boy.

255
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,800
 <i>Otan asprisi o kokoras.</i>

256
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,100
According to this,
the Montiquans shared

257
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,600
a meal of
oysters

258
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,700
to settle disputes.

259
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,400
I mean, this stuff is
hundreds of years old.

260
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,700
It should be protected,
you know, and preserved.

261
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,900
Maybe that's what this was for.

262
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Montiquan National
Cultural Center.

263
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,800
There are very few
tribal members still left.

264
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,400
From what I know,
a few hundred years ago,

265
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,600
the Montiquans were a
thriving, peaceful people.

266
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,200
This look peaceful to you?

267
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,100
No, sure doesn't.

268
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,400
It just looks like
Delaware had some big plans

269
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,900
for his little tribe.

270
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,400
Yeah, and if that's true,

271
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,500
how come it all ended up
in a wastebasket?

272
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,500
And what dispute were they
trying to solve with oysters?

273
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,400
Well, I hope you can
sew this button ba on.

274
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,100
I've had some practice
with stitches.

275
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,800
Meanwhile,
I think I figured out

276
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,600
what this mystery pick is
that Sid pulled

277
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,000
 <i>from our vic's gut.</i>

278
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,900
 <i>I ran it through GCMS</i>

279
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,400
and it spiked for keratin,

280
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,700
but it isn't any kind
of bone or antler

281
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,500
from a land-dwelling mammal.

282
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,400
According to DNA,
it's baleen.

283
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,800
Baleen?

284
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,200
From a whale's mouth?

285
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,700
Yep, and if you ask me,

286
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,900
this is how it got from there
to our vic's intestines.

287
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,200
The baleen would have been
too long and sharp

288
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,200
and difficult to swallow
like this, but...

289
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,700
if you could
somehow

290
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,400
fold it over
and tie it like this,

291
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,200
it'd be a lot easier to swallow.

292
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,300
In an oyster, maybe.
Yeah, with
a little Worcestershire

293
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,900
or cocktail sauce.

294
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,300
(laughs)
Now,

295
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,600
once it's taken a nice bath

296
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,900
in your gastric acids...

297
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,000
Ouch.

298
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,600
Instant bellyache.

299
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,800
Explains
how it might have ended up

300
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,500
passing through his GI tract.

301
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,000
It also confirms it
wasn't an accident.

302
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,100
Somebody tied it up
and fed ito him.

303
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,300
But the use and sale of baleen
is strictly controlled

304
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,900
by the Marine Mammal
Protection Act,

305
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,700
so I looked for a list of
possible sources in the city

306
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,400
and found one.

307
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,300
Agra Imports in Jackson Heights.

308
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,300
Hey, Mac.

309
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,900
I ran a Lexis/Nexis search

310
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,800
on the address
from those blueprints

311
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
 <i>that we found</i>
 <i>at Delaware's place.</i>

312
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,900
 <i>Turns out he was involved</i>

313
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,200
in a pretty heated
property dispute.

314
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,200
4024 Radford was
apparently on land

315
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,900
once oed by the
Montiquan Tribal Nation.

316
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,000
Until it was
reclaimed

317
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,700
by the Bureau of Indian
Affairs in the 1800s.

318
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,300
Right.

319
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,800
Only last year,
Amos found a sympathetic judge

320
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,300
who agreed that the BIA
had brok a treaty.

321
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,300
He was willing to deed the
land back to the Montiquans,

322
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,100
so this prompted
the previous owner

323
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,100
to file suit against the chief
and his entire tribe.

324
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,600
And who are they?

325
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,700
Agra Imports

326
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,900
in Jackson Heights.

327
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,100
That's the same place
that imports baleen.

328
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,800
Don Flack.

329
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,100
Just the guy
I need to see.

330
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,800
 <i>Namaste.</i>

331
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,000
How you doing?

332
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,400
You the owner
of Agra Imports?

333
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
Third generation.

334
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,300
Leila Vara.
How can I help you?

335
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,200
Maybe you can tell us
about your property dispute

336
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,500
with Amos Delaware and
the Montiquan Indian Nation.

337
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,600
That matter has been resolved.

338
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,500
I guess death has a
way of doing that.

339
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
I'm sorry?

340
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,000
We believe Chief
Delaware was murdered

341
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,100
and you might be able to tell us
something about it.

342
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,000
 <i>Hai Bhagwaan.</i>

343
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,500
I knew nothing about it.

344
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,400
You named him
in a lawsuit

345
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,600
over the land seized from you
by the state.

346
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,800
I did, indeed.

347
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,900
It may not seem like much
to you and that judge in Albany,

348
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,500
but that property was given
to me by my grandfather.

349
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,600
He used to run this
very business there.

350
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,000
But am not an
immigrant like he was.

351
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,200
I am an American citizen
born in this city

352
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,500
and I know what my rights are.
Do they include

353
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,900
gutting Amos Delaware
with a piece of baleen?

354
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,800
You import that,
to don't you?

355
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,400
In certain pieces of
ceremonial art, yes.

356
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,600
I can assure you I no longer had

357
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,900
That's not what the suit says.

358
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,800
No, you don't understand.

359
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,600
He gave the land back.

360
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,700
He came in here two days ago

361
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,700
and he said
that he needed to talk.

362
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,800
You've got a lot of
nerve coming in here.

363
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,100
You going to try
and take this property, too?
Wait, wait, wait.

364
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,700
Listen.

365
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,700
I made a mistake.

366
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,200
LEILA:
 <i>He said</i>
 <i>that by gaining the land,</i>

367
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,700
 <i>that his tribe had lost</i>
 <i>its integrity,</i>

368
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,400
 <i>that he'd have an attorney</i>
 <i>draw up the papers</i>

369
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,800
 <i>and he'd give it back.</i>

370
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,700
 <i>He even apologized.</i>

371
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,900
Check out his lung tissue.

372
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,600
HAWKES:
It's rainbow colored.

373
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,000
And when he walked out the door,

374
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,700
I'm telling you,
he seemed almost relieved.

375
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,600
All the same, we're going
to have to confiscate

376
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,700
every piece of baleen that
you're selling in the store.

377
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,600
Look, you can take
everything that you want,

378
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,800
but you're gonna have
to take my word along with it.

379
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,200
I was angry at a lot of people

380
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,900
over what happened
to my family's property,

381
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,100
but I believe deeply in karma,

382
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,500
and somehow,
I think that man did, too.

383
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,200
Think she's lying?

384
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,500
Well, he did die before
he gave her the deed back,

385
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,900
but it's up to our
friends back at the lab

386
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,300
to keep her motive alive.

387
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,200
What do you say?
Want to head back?

388
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,200
Sure, but mind if we go
a less colorful route this time?

389
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,100
Noroblem.

390
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,900
Oh, heads up.
Come here.

391
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,300
You've got some shmutz
on you.
Oh.

392
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,900
Hey!

393
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,400
(laughs)
Yeah.

394
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,000
You, too.

395
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,400
NYPD blue.

396
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,700
c, you got a second?

397
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,600
What's up?

398
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,600
What do you think
about the name Kurt?

399
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,300
That's, uh...
That's German origin.

400
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,900
Means courageous, I think.

401
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,700
Really?
Yeah.

402
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,300
I like that name.
any of these names
Have you with Lindsay?

403
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,900
Yeah. I mean, no.

404
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,800
I mean, not yet.

405
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,200
I'm kind of just
doing my homework.

406
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,700
Me, too.

407
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,100
Right. Right.
I'm sorry.

408
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,500
What are we looking
at, 4024 Radford?

409
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,900
Yeah. These are two
separate satellite images.

410
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,400
One from a year ago.

411
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,900
And a second,
six months old.

412
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,100
Tell me what the difference is
between the two.

413
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,700
Hmm, fencing
has been added.

414
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,600
It's an air conditioning
unit atop the building.

415
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,400
Service vehicle out front.

416
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,000
Clearly,

417
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,500
some activity has
been going on.

418
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,300
But otherwise, it's
just another building

419
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,100
in a three
square-mile area.

420
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,700
Wait, wait a second.

421
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
I've seen this land before.

422
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,100
Yeah.

423
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,900
This is a painting from

424
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,800
Delaware's place.

425
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,400
A few hundred
years ago,

426
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,200
this was the Montiquan
ancestral home.

427
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,700
Good catch.

428
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,200
So, what's it being used for
now?

429
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,300
I don't know, but I
think we should take

430
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,000
a closer look.

431
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
NOTICE SPOVEREIGN PROPERTY OF THE
MONTIQUAN INDIAN NATION.
NO ACCESS PERMITTED.

432
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,500
TAYLOR:
This is as close
as we're gonna get

433
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,500
without a federal
warrant.

434
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,200
It's hard to believe

435
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,100
the Montiquans used
to own half the waterfront,

436
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,200
and this is all they got left.

437
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,400
Looks like brand new
fiber optic connection.

438
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,000
Put in a call
to the telecom company.

439
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
See if you can find out
what they're feeding.

440
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,100
This ground may be sacred,

441
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,800
BUT ???

442
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,300
Brushing up on your ABCs?

443
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,300
Uh, actually, I'm trying
to learn Chief Delaware's.

444
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,300
Outside of a few common
American Indian characters,

445
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,600
this strange writing

446
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,900
in his journal is
completely unique.

447
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,300
And if it's
Montiquan, I-I...

448
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,800
I'm thinking that he was
the last person le

449
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
to actually speak it.

450
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,300
Some Nive American populations
have gotten so fractured

451
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,900
that their languages
are actually endangered.

452
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,100
Yeah?

453
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,100
Well, I think
this one died with him.

454
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,300
There are a few
other words here

455
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,300
that are similar to other
tribal equivalents.

456
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,600
"Uncertainty.
Anger. Pain."

457
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,400
He was obviously upset
about something.

458
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,100
And one word appears
over and over,

459
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,200
and I can't for the life of me

460
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,200
figure out what it means.

461
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,100
"Tehonzuk."

462
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,400
You're on your own there.

463
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,000
Thanks, Danny.

464
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,800
Come on. You're trying
to tell me something.

465
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,700
It's just lost in translation.

466
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,200
 <i>Sliotar. Caman.</i>

467
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,000
 <i>Sliotar...</i>
Adam?

468
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,400
What are you
talking about?

469
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,300
Uh, sorry.

470
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,400
Uh, this is a Sliotar,
and this is a Caman.

471
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,000
And both are used
in the Gaelic game of hurling.

472
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,900
Ah. The playing field
on the Montiquan property.

473
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,600
Mac asked me to follow up on it.
Then I analyzed the splinter

474
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
 <i>that Sid pulled</i>
 <i>from Chief Delaware's thigh.</i>

475
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,000
Turns out to be ash wood.

476
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,400
 <i>But not just any ash wood--</i>

477
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,500
 <i>Irish ash wood from Ireland.</i>

478
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,200
So once I paired it to the shape
and size of his leg contusion,

479
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,600
I started thinking, you know,

480
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,600
it might have been caused
by a caman like this.

481
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,900
Used by a cretin like this.

482
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,500
It's Finn Wexford, captain
of the Queens Hurling Club

483
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
and proud recipient
of an A-misdemeanor

484
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,900
for cruelty to animals.

485
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,000
What does this mean to us?

486
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,700
Well, apparently,
Mr. Wexford didn't like

487
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,900
stray dogs leaving messes
on his practice field,

488
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,600
so, like any good boy
from the Old Country,

489
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,400
he stuffed nails
inside of hamburger meat

490
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,900
and took care
of the problem.

491
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,500
But that was last year.

492
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,000
This year, he got
his practice field taken away

493
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,400
when the Montiquans
reclaimed their land.

494
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,400
LOOK

495
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,700
POLICE

496
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,600
SMELL

497
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,500
What do you think,
you're

498
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,600
the only one whose grandpa
taught him a little Irish?

499
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,300
You're interrupting a game.
FLACK:
Yeah.

500
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,900
I'm surprised to see that.

501
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,700
Didn't the chief
of the Montiquan Nation tell you

502
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,600
that you needed
to find a new practice field?

503
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,100
He doesn't belong.
I think he got that message
loud and clear.

504
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,700
Meaning?

505
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,900
He's dead.

506
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,900
Don't pretend
like you don't kn.

507
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,100
Okay, look,

508
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,200
the guy already
came by here once

509
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,600
telling us we had to
find a new place to play.

510
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,300
Then he shows
up again.

511
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,500
I tell him
we aren't going anywhere.

512
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,200
It gets heated.

513
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,500
My ancestors were here
before you.

514
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Well, perhaps you'd like
to join them then?

515
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,600
Look, I just came
to say you can stay.

516
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,100
Why should we believe you?

517
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,700
I really don't care
what you believe, sissy.

518
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,100
Well, you damn
well better.

519
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,800
Because I believe

520
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,700
that you wanted to make sure
he wouldn't change his mind,

521
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,100
and so you gave him
the stray dog treatment.

522
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,600
Am I right?
What'd you do

523
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,500
Take him out for lunch,
and add a little extra kick

524
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,400
into his corned beef
and cabbage?

525
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,900
What are you accusing  of?

526
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,500
What are you denying?

527
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,300
Okay, now that you've
harassed an officer,

528
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,400
why don't we head back
to our playing field downtown?

529
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,500
Sound good to you, Flack?

530
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,900
MY PLEASURE.

531
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,100
The splinters are a
match to the caman,

532
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,400
and Wexford's prints
are all over 'em.

533
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,200
But priors aside, we can't
connect him in any way

534
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,300
to the baleen that
killed Chief Delaware.

535
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,600
And none of the items
that Flack and Angell

536
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,900
took from Leila Vara match
(beeping)

537
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,300
what Hawkes and Sid found
in Delaware's gut.

538
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,000
Hold on a second.
This might help.

539
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,300
According to carbon dating,
our murder weapon

540
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,800
is over 300 years old.

541
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,100
BONASERA:
Gentlemen, I give you
the Wolfkiller.

542
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,400
Centuries ago,
the Montiquans carved

543
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,400
and folded sharp strips
of baleen,

544
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,800
tied them up tightly
with catgut cord,

545
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,200
and tucked them
into chunks of raw meat.

546
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,900
Then they deftly scattered
their murder weapons

547
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,000
in the wilderness of Manhattan

548
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,400
to kill wolves,
wild boar and bears.

549
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Not to mention Indian Chiefs.

550
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,600
TAYLOR:
Somebody obviously

551
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,500
blew the dust off this one
and put a new spin on it.

552
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Hmm.
Let's get
a list

553
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,600
from the Bureau of Indian
Affairs of all living

554
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,400
members of the
Montiquan Nation.

555
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,300
You think Chief Delaware
might have actlly been killed

556
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,400
by one of his own?

557
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,900
Well, I can tell you this much.

558
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,900
Whoever took this weapon
from his room

559
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,600
not only knew
how to use it,

560
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,300
but who they were using it on.

561
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,200
Sounds like
a pretty painful betrayal.

562
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
BONASERA:
Maybe the Montiquans weren't

563
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
such a peaceful tribe after all.

564
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,800
Hey, okay, according to the BIA,

565
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
there's a handful
of Montiquan
tribal members

566
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,200
still living in Oklahoma.

567
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,500
Aside from Chief Delaware,

568
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,700
there's only one
registered member

569
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,100
in the New York City area.

570
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,800
That's a Liam Connover.

571
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,000
 <i>Mr. Connover is the hotel's</i>

572
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 <i>information technology</i>
 <i>consulnt.</i>

573
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Connover?

574
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,800
That's the name of the I.T. guy.

575
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,300
The one that was trying
to take the computer

576
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,900
out of Chief Delaware's room.

577
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,000
So, what didn't he
want you to see?

578
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,900
Welcome to the real Montiquan
Nation Cultural Center.

579
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,700
An online gambling site?

580
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,800
That's what's going on
inside our warehouse.

581
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,300
Poker Native.com.

582
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,900
And the telecom
company confirmed

583
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,500
that high speed
fiber optic lines

584
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,100
were installed at the warehouse.

585
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,500
And the industrial cooling unit

586
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,900
is consistent with
what it would take

587
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,200
to maintain ideal temps

588
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,400
for server storage.

589
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,900
So, we did a littlepacket sniffing.

590
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,100
Packet sniffing?

591
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,500
What our little
beardefriend

592
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,300
from the Tech Republic
is trying to say is

593
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,700
that we use a subpoena

594
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,800
to, uh, analyze the
data between the servers

595
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,000
and the network users.

596
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,400
It's basically like
bugging a phone

597
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,600
except we digitally figured out

598
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,300
what was going on
inside the warehouse

599
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,000
without actually goingn.

600
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,100
According to this log in window,
this site is currently hosting

601
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,100
884 games just like
this around the world.

602
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,300
I thought it was against the law

603
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,000
to run online gambling
operations in the U.S.

604
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,200
MAC: It is, but some
Native American tribes

605
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,100
have started taking advantage
of their sovereign land statat

606
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,600
to build sites like this

607
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,300
instead of expensive brick
and mortar casinos.

608
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,100
Sounds like some
grey legal ground.

609
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,500
Yeah, not only that, but from
what we've learned about him,

610
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,100
Chief Delaware was all about

611
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,000
preserving the integrity
of his tribe.

612
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,300
It just doesn't seem like he
would front something like this.

613
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,200
HAWKES: But why not?

614
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,600
Even if running
a gambling operation

615
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,500
was hard for him
to swallow at first,

616
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,000
in this day and age,

617
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,700
it can go a long way

618
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,600
to promoting pride
and especially prosperity

619
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,300
for all kinds
of Native Americans.

620
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,900
How's he able to bankroll
something like this?

621
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,000
Well, according to the telecom
company, he didn't.

622
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,500
A firm called LCV paid for it.

623
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,900
LIAM CONNERVER VENTURES

624
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,100
Oh, we gotta find out
STELLwhere this guy is now.res.

625
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,300
I think he's right there.

626
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,700
TAYLOR:
Adam, run an IP address
on this player,

627
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,800
LCV.

628
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,600
Then, tell me:
Why in the world would he

629
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,400
fold on a full house...

630
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,800
LCV:MAN, U GUYS ARE GONNA HERT.

631
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,800

632
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,000
OkayHe's alone.here.

633
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,400

634
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400

635
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,500
TAYLOR:
Don't move.

636
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,100

Cheater.

639
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,100
That's what it means,

640
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,600
doesn't it?

641
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,400
It's the best translation
I can offer

642
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,700
for the combination
of "game" and easel".

643
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,500
Sounds about right to me.

644
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,000
You don't know
what you're talking about.

645
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,400
Then, why don't you educate us?

646
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,500
Just like Chief Delaware
tried to do for you, Liam.

647
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,300
I didn't care about any
of that old-school crap.

648
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,800
All I know is
he asked me to set up

649
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,800
a gambling site.

650
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,200
As a means
to an end.

651
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,400
He just wanted
to raise the funds

652
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,900
to renovate that warehouse
into a cultural center

653
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,000
for the tribe.
Except you moved in

654
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,500
and got greedy.

655
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,400
TAYLOR:
 <i>Then, Chief Delaware caught you</i>

656
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,900
 <i>cheating dozens of people</i>
 <i>out of thousands of dollars.</i>

657
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,200
In small increments,

658
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,000
it probably didn't
seem like much to you.

659
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,500
We might not have even
caught it ourselves

660
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,100
without our computers
searching every winning hand

661
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,500
of the pasthree months.

662
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,000
BONASERA:
To Chief Delaware,
that cost was immense,

663
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,900
so he confronted you.

664
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,000
Wanted to settle the dispute
the way your ancestors had.

665
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,800
It's not right!

666
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,900
Relax, it's just a game.

667
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,700

After all the time
I've spent with you,

have you learned nothing
of our history?

671
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,600
I'll give the land back

672
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,100
before I allow this tribe
to be disgraced.

673
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,200
Okay, you're right.

674
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
I'm sorry.

675
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,900
I'll clean
this mess up.

676
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,500
I promise.

used that time

680
