You are talented.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:09,166
Just do your best,
and stay calm.

in my driveway?

29
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:18,610
The swim team is having
a car wash today,

00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:21,396

hand out flyers.

Of course I'm not late.

56
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,785
Okay. I'm not.

57
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:01,270
You are special,
you're an artist.

58
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:03,173
Everything you do
is art.

59
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:05,659
Why, everything you say,
everything you do

60
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:06,784
is just all art,
it's just brilliant.

61
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,253
You're brilliant.

62
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:09,262
Right. You're really good.

63
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,817
Oh, I don't wanna
talk about it.

64
00:03:14,852 --> 00:03:17,045
Dude, chill.

65
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:20,415
Artists don't need college.

66
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,926
I will pay for
those parking tickets.

67
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,586
You're bringing me down.
I gotta go.

68
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,345
Bye, Mom.

69
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,681
Breathe.

70
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:31,050
Hi. I'm Lola Perez.

71
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,745
Could you let
Mr. Vasquez know I'm here?

72
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,380
Thanks, I'd appreciate it.

73
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:38,016
Uh, I don't work here.

74
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,775
I'm a finalist for
the photography internship.

75
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,478
Me, too.

76
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,154
Sh, sh, sh!

77
00:03:43,188 --> 00:03:45,015
Quiet, please.
Voices down.

78
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:46,741
Mr. Vasquez is having
a creative moment.

79
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:50,270
Yes, brilliant!
Perfect-alus! Bravo!

80
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:52,388
- Oh, it's so cool.
- Weird.

81
00:03:52,423 --> 00:03:53,940
Okay.
( clears throat )

82
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:55,592
Now, can I have
your portfolios?

83
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:58,044
Mr. Vasquez would like
to review them before
your final interviews.

84
00:03:58,078 --> 00:03:58,937
Careful. Mine's
still wet.

85
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:03,883
- Mine's perfectly dry.
- Thanks.

86
00:04:03,918 --> 00:04:05,209
Please have a seat.

87
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:06,411
This could take
ten seconds,

88
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,612
or ten hours.

89
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,324
Hey, didn't you go
to Highland Park?

90
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,842
Um, yes.

91
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:22,619
I still do.

92
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:24,103
Wait.

93
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,397
You were
that nerdy sophomore

94
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,782
in my senior
geometry class.

95
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:28,908
I'm not nerdy.
I'm dedicated.

96
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:31,828
I skipped
the eighth grade,

97
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:33,772
and now I'm on track
for early college admission.

98
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,081
Wow. That sounds
really fun.

99
00:04:35,116 --> 00:04:37,909
But not.

100
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,037
( chuckles )
Well, I've already
got 12 credits,

101
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,022
two hundred hours
of community service,

102
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:45,375
maintain a 4.2 GPA,
and run my own business.

103
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:49,504
This art internship
will perfectly round out
my transcript.

104
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,115
Transcript?
That's why you're here?

105
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:55,827
Well, you know, that,
and my passion for photography.

106
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:57,979
Right, right.

107
00:04:58,014 --> 00:05:01,040
Well, do you wanna know
what I did my last year
before college?

108
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:03,151
You were accepted
into college?

109
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:05,487
I could have been,
but I opted out.

110
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:08,590
You see, a real artist
is a student of life.

111
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:10,784
Anyway, an internship
with Leon Vasquez

112
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:14,020
would fast-track my career
as a professional photographer.

113
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:16,840
( ringtone plays
"Fur Elise" )

114
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:18,258
Professor Anderson,
is this about

115
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:20,310
my recommendation letter?

116
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:22,420
<i>No, I'm actually looking for</i>
<i>someone to babysit tonight,</i>

117
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:24,247
<i>because my niece</i>
<i>bailed on me.</i>

118
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,699
- Okay, uh...
-<i>  Do you believe it?</i>

119
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,384
I'd love to babysit,
but unfortunately,

120
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:29,210
I'm already booked
with the Coopers tonight.

121
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,253
<i>Let me know if you can</i>
<i>think of anybody.</i>

122
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,530
Sure. Of course.
If I think of anyone.

123
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:34,341
-<i>  Thanks, Jenny.</i>
- All right. Bye.

124
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,509
You're a babysitter?

125
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,453
What's that, like,
five bucks an hour?

126
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:40,405
Try 20. Double time
on holidays.

127
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,124
To watch kids
watch TV?

128
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:45,935
( laughs )
You've obviously
never babysat.

129
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,929
Yeah, 'cause I obviously
have a life.

130
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,548
Oh,<i>  magnifico!</i>
My exceptional finalists.

131
00:05:57,473 --> 00:05:59,315
Oh, gosh!
Way to go, klutz.

132
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:00,458
A smoothie to
an interview?!

133
00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:02,861
Stupendous
news, ladies.

134
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:06,881
I've decided interviews
will not be needed today.

135
00:06:06,915 --> 00:06:08,633
Awesome.
Sorry, kid,
maybe next year.

136
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,010
You wish.

137
00:06:11,044 --> 00:06:12,604
Since you both have
vastly different

138
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:13,747
artistic points
of view,

139
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:18,910
I feel a more unconventional
approach is warranted.

140
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,670
I want you to dazzle me!

141
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:23,974
- Dazzle you?
- Could you clarify,
dazzle, sir?

142
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,208
Take some new shots.

143
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:26,709
Be innovative.

144
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:30,071
I want to feel
your unique passions
for photography.

145
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:31,414
Oh, cool!

146
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:32,006
( speaking fluent Spanish )

147
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:38,388
( speaking halting
Spanish )

148
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:44,694
<i>Excelente.</i>

149
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,996
We'll reconvene Monday,
and I'll make my decision.

150
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,466
That gives you
all weekend.

151
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,859
- May the best artist win.
- BOTH: She will.

152
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:53,302
- Bye-bye.
-<i>  Ciao. Gracias.</i>

153
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:54,070
<i>Adios.</i>

154
00:06:56,065 --> 00:07:00,402
Well, this hardly seems
fair considering the time
constraints.

155
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:03,121
Oh, right. Have fun
babysitting.

156
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:10,211
No! Officer, wait!

157
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:13,431
Officer, hi.
I'm here.

158
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:15,250
Sorry, miss.
It's a loading zone.

159
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:17,777
But I was loading.

160
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,771
I was unloading
a super heavy portfolio

161
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:21,989
for this very prestigious
art internship.

162
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,342
- I spoke to Mr. Vasquez.
- Uh-huh.

163
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:25,226
( ringtone playing
"Fur Elise" )

164
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,179
Beethoven?

165
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:30,465
What?

166
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:33,001
"Fur Elise" is one
of my favorites.

167
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,277
( nervous chuckle )

168
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,572
- That your boyfriend
calling?
- What? No.

169
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:40,025
Boyfriend? What boyfriend?

170
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,876
No boyfriend
Totally single.
Sorry.

171
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:45,013
- Hello, stranger
interrupting my day.
<i>- Hey, Jenny.</i>

172
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,039
It's Zac.

173
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:48,833
Look, I know it's
short notice,

174
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,218
but I just scored
great tickets

175
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:53,129
for the Psychic Rockets
concert tonight, and I was--

176
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:54,422
Awesome. I love that band.

177
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:57,950
But I hate concerts.

178
00:07:57,985 --> 00:08:00,228
They're so juvenile.

179
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:02,847
Sorry, Zeke.
Not interested. Bye.

180
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,969
( sighs )

181
00:08:08,003 --> 00:08:11,347
Whew! Stalkers.
What's a girl to do?

182
00:08:11,381 --> 00:08:13,082
Wait, you're
still writing?

183
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,968
Uh, officer, I can't
get another ticket.

184
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:16,027
My parents said if I got
another parking ticket,

185
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:17,954
- I would lose
my car keys.
- Sorry. I'm a rookie.

186
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:20,381
Can't break the rules.

187
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,499
I'm sure a smart girl
like you can find a way

188
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:22,492
to pay her own tickets.

189
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:25,644
Have a nice day.

190
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,288
Thanks.

191
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,961
Eighty bucks?!

192
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:36,723
Where am I gonna get
80 bucks?

193
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:38,424
( "Fur Elise" plays )

194
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:43,129
Hello.

195
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:44,722
Jenny, hi, it's me again.

196
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,432
I'm desperate for
a babysitter.

197
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:48,701
My awards gala
is in two hours,

198
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,103
and I am
the guest of honor.

199
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:51,980
Are you sure you don't
know anybody who can babysit?

200
00:08:52,014 --> 00:08:53,515
I'll pay double.

201
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:54,958
( cash register jingles )

202
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,902
Of course.

203
00:08:57,936 --> 00:09:00,054
My good friend Lola
is very responsible.

204
00:09:00,088 --> 00:09:01,722
- I'll send her over.
<i>- Great.</i>

205
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:03,491
- Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

206
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,143
Hey, Zac.

207
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,521
Dirty tires,
as requested.

208
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,464
Sorry. We're closed.

209
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:21,342
Come on, let's go.

210
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,698
TREY: Yes, of course.

211
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:37,292
My mom's going to
some party tonight.

212
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,786
Dude, I said I'm in.

213
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,962
Pick me up in 30 and don't
honk the horn this time.

214
00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:44,124
- Trey Anderson.
- Mom! A little privacy.

215
00:09:44,158 --> 00:09:47,476
Kids who spend over $200
on apps without permission

216
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,703
don't get privacy,

217
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:51,856
or phones,
or tablets.

218
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,408
You forgot to cut off
my air supply.

219
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,301
Oh, that can be arranged.

220
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:57,019
Look, we're leaving
for the gala soon,

221
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,304
so please, be nice
to the babysitter.

222
00:09:58,338 --> 00:09:59,922
Wait, Jenny's coming?

223
00:09:59,957 --> 00:10:02,550
No. Ugh. One of
Jenny's friends.

224
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:03,901
And you need
to shape up, Trey.

225
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:06,495
At this rate, you'll never be
responsible enough to babysit.

226
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,065
Promise?

227
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,327
Bobby Anderson, what
have you done to my kitchen?

228
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,686
It's called baking.

229
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,438
Mom!

230
00:10:16,473 --> 00:10:17,940
Dad promised
to take me.

231
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:19,801
The Sirens
are playing the Belles.

232
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:22,361
I'm sorry, honey.
I got the dates mixed up.

233
00:10:22,395 --> 00:10:24,931
It's not every day
your mother's research

234
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:28,050
is honored by
the National Science Foundation.

235
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,502
Dad will take you
to the next derby.

236
00:10:29,537 --> 00:10:31,421
We promise.

237
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:33,264
- Can you get our coats?
- Yes.

238
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,017
Mom, you promised
to taste my frosting.

239
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:39,019
- In a minute.
- I guess everyone in
this family breaks promises.

240
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:40,221
Come on,
Roller Derby's lame.

241
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:41,614
You're lame!

242
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:43,624
Guys, don't start.

243
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,042
KATY: Hurry. Jenny will
be here any minute.

244
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:47,437
Ta-da!

245
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:49,013
Okay, bumblebee,
I can't decide

246
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:52,800
if I would rather lose feeling
in my toes or my heels.

247
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:56,254
I told you to go
with the strappy sandals.

248
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:59,265
Excuse me, young lady.
What are you wearing?

249
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:02,685
- Lipstick.
- No. Do not be cute.

250
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,661
Those earrings
are very expensive, sweetie.

251
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:05,880
They're one of a kind.

252
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,633
But Mommy, everyone knows
diamonds are a must

253
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:09,842
with evening casual.

254
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:12,028
Off. Now.

255
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:14,063
If my sister
can shave her head,

256
00:11:14,097 --> 00:11:15,489
I should be able
to wear diamonds.

257
00:11:15,523 --> 00:11:16,799
What?!

258
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:18,501
( buzzing )

259
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,681
( gasps )
Emily Cooper,
what are you doing?

260
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:27,085
- You little tattletale!
- You don't have the right
head shape for a buzz cut.

261
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,870
Why don't I give you
a buzz cut?

262
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:30,497
- Okay, stop.
- ( huffs angrily )

263
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:34,234
Sweetheart, your hair
is beautiful just
the way it is.

264
00:11:34,268 --> 00:11:36,919
I don't want you pulling
any of your pranks tonight,

265
00:11:36,953 --> 00:11:37,979
and please be good
for Jenny.

266
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:39,480
( angry huff )

267
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:41,423
I'm too old
for a babysitter.

268
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,543
Me, too.

269
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,610
Katy Cooper, freeze.

270
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:50,575
I thought diamonds
were forever.

271
00:11:55,964 --> 00:11:57,749
( rock music
ringtone plays )

272
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,380
Oh, no.

273
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:07,800
This is not happening.

274
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,487
- Hello.
- BOY:<i>  Lola, what's up?</i>

275
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:13,231
No, this isn't Lola.

276
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,057
I just...
I have her phone.

277
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:17,026
<i>Come to</i>
<i>a toga party tonight?</i>

278
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,560
No, I don't wanna come to
a toga party.

279
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:21,188
GUYS:<i>  Toga, toga, toga!</i>

280
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:21,939
- ( horn honks )
- Ugh!

281
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,911
( doorbell ringing )

282
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,873
Hey, dude,
what's your name?

283
00:12:38,907 --> 00:12:39,916
You're so cute.

284
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:45,338
Alison, was that...

285
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,034
Lola? Helen Anderson.
So nice to meet you.

286
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,978
Please come on in.

287
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:53,488
I see that you've
met Alison.

288
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,758
- So sweet.
- Yes.

289
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:57,917
So my niece
was supposed to sit,

290
00:12:57,951 --> 00:13:00,637
but she flaked because of some
silly concert in the city.

291
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:02,780
So how long have you known
our Jenny?

292
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:06,551
Oh, um, since forever.

293
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,544
We share a love of
geometry and...

294
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:10,421
children.

295
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,331
- Oh, how unique.
- Yeah.

296
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:15,326
Lola, this is Bobby.
He has to finish 100 cupcakes

297
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,302
for his junior chef
competition tomorrow.

298
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:19,614
- Taste my frosting.
- Sure.

299
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:21,890
Oh, dig that color, dude.

300
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:23,500
It's the melted
gummy worms.

301
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:25,662
Oh, Bobby,
you didn't.

302
00:13:25,696 --> 00:13:27,530
Mom, all the great chefs
improvise.

303
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:29,131
I'm never gonna win
with ordinary cupcakes.

304
00:13:29,165 --> 00:13:31,617
It's not bad,
but you could
kick it up a notch.

305
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:33,619
I know. It needs
something.

306
00:13:33,653 --> 00:13:35,688
I just have to find
the perfect ingredient.

307
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:38,240
Now Trey is upstairs
grounded.

308
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,677
Alison is sulking
because of the Roller Derby,

309
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:44,522
and this little
precious baby girl

310
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:46,691
is Lady Marmalade,
aren't you, my precious?

311
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,876
Yes, you are.

312
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,185
Now she has
a very big day tomorrow

313
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,797
at the Kennel Club,
so she needs
complete relaxation,

314
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,724
and no stress.
No stress for my baby.

315
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,960
Now very important.

316
00:13:57,995 --> 00:14:01,122
The stove and the hot tub
are strictly off limits
when we're gone.

317
00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:03,758
Make sure that Bobby
returns the kitchen

318
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,384
to its pre-cupcake
tidiness.

319
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:08,496
Tidiness? I'm creating.

320
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,496
And you would be
my personal hero

321
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:11,941
if you could just
toss in a couple
of loads of laundry.

322
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:13,868
- Laundry.
- Yes.

323
00:14:13,902 --> 00:14:17,596
Okay, here's the invite
and my number.

324
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,999
- Oh, hi.
I'm Hal Anderson.
- Lola.

325
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,450
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

326
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:24,186
Oh, no, we are not taking my
brand-new freshly detailed SUV

327
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,606
into the dirty, grimy city.
We're taking the sedan.

328
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:29,617
- You're the boss.
- Thank you.

329
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:31,944
Okay, Lola,
here is my cell,

330
00:14:31,978 --> 00:14:34,238
and the place
we're going to be tonight.

331
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:35,906
Now are you sure you can
handle three kids?

332
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,167
Oh, my gosh,
what am I saying?

333
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,885
Of course you can.
You were recommended by Jenny.

334
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,703
- She taught me
everything I know.
- Great.

335
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,991
Hi, Jen.
Come on in.

336
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:48,603
Oh, Mr. Cooper,
that's a nice tux.

337
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,371
Okay, honey.
Honey.

338
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:52,765
She did it again.

339
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,316
Katy, sweetheart,
what did I tell you

340
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,984
about glittering
your father?

341
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:57,511
He needed
a little bling.

342
00:14:57,546 --> 00:14:59,855
Okay,
don't you worry.

343
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:01,524
We will clean that
right up.

344
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:02,416
You guys just go
and have a great time.

345
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:04,351
Thank you, Jenny.

346
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:06,604
Now would you please
say hello to Jenny?

347
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,432
Honestly.
Look it, I left money

348
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:11,701
so you guys can
go for ice cream.

349
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,503
Emily is banned from
doing anything to her hair.

350
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,347
Katy is banned from
my jewelry box.

351
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:18,483
- Great.
- Am I forgetting anything?

352
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,376
My three-star party
survival kit.

353
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,270
Mints, safety pins
and emergency cash.

354
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:25,840
- Take care of our babies.
- I'll guard them with my life.

355
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:26,982
- We're going out.
- I know.

356
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:28,125
Run! Just kidding.

357
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,800
Ooh, hot tub.

358
00:15:47,621 --> 00:15:49,221
Hot tub out back?

359
00:15:49,255 --> 00:15:51,456
- Yep.
- Cool.

360
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:53,434
Jailer Swift
on the attack!

361
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:54,860
Whoa!

362
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:58,197
Out of my kitchen!

363
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:08,516
Fire! Lola, help!

364
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,276
Fire, fire.
Help!

365
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:13,654
Hurry. Fire! Fire!

366
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:17,408
- What?
- Fire!

367
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:20,177
- Put out the fire!
- Uh, fire extinguisher?

368
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,654
( "Fur Elise"
ringtone plays )

369
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:24,565
- BOBBY: This is bad!
- LOLA: Get the fire
extinguisher.

370
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,501
Hello. Lola?

371
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:31,013
- No, A.J.
-<i>  A.J. Anderson?</i>
<i>It's Jenny Parker.</i>

372
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:32,339
Why are you
answering my phone?

373
00:16:32,373 --> 00:16:33,799
It's the babysitter's phone.

374
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,427
- Babysitter?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

375
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:38,162
Your friend. I think
her name's Lola.

376
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:42,783
A.J. sweetie, could you please
put the babysitter on the phone?

377
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:45,211
- She's busy.
<i>- Doing what?</i>

378
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:46,287
Putting out the fire.

379
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:50,107
The fire?!

380
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:52,476
A.J., don't panic.
I'll be right there, okay?

381
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,211
Kids, we're going
to the Andersons.

382
00:16:56,123 --> 00:16:57,465
Trey Anderson?

383
00:16:57,499 --> 00:16:59,491
Katy, let's go.

384
00:16:59,526 --> 00:17:01,827
Katy, I mean now.

385
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:02,595
- ( alarm blaring )
- BOBBY: Come on, hurry!

386
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:11,753
( alarm continues
blaring )

387
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:13,322
That was awesome.

388
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:16,392
Wait here, don't move.
I gotta get my camera
out of the car.

389
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:19,362
Camera?

390
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:22,815
( horn honks )

391
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,659
Hey, let me in,
you little punks.

392
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:26,402
Unlock the door!

393
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:28,595
Unlock the door!

394
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,366
What in the world
is going on here?!

395
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,701
Uh...

396
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:35,711
What is on fire?

397
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:38,030
- Hey, girl, what's up?
- Girl?

398
00:17:38,064 --> 00:17:39,298
( stammering )
What are you doing?

399
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,092
Babysitting.
Obviously.

400
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:47,631
I can't believe this.

401
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,926
This is going to take
forever to clean up.

402
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,410
( Lola laughing )
Yeah, it will.

403
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,453
You kids better
get crackin'.

404
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:54,438
- Us?
- ( shutter clicks )

405
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,501
Hey, where's Trey?

406
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,111
Who's Trey?

407
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:03,239
( knocking )

408
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:15,450
He's searching for
tickets online.

409
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:18,371
Psychic Rockets tickets
at Tiny's Pawn Shop?

410
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:19,922
He's going to
a concert?

411
00:18:19,956 --> 00:18:21,565
That's awesome.

412
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,051
How could you let
a 14-year-old kid
sneak out into the city?

413
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:25,402
I'm sorry, how is this
my fault?

414
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,613
Babysitting rule
number one:

415
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,715
Never take your eyes
off the kids. Ever.

416
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:31,567
Okay, this is bad.

417
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:32,934
My name,
my reputation,

418
00:18:32,969 --> 00:18:34,612
my entire
college future

419
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,788
is just down the drain.

420
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:37,648
Think, Jenny, think.

421
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:43,378
He has to get
the tickets, right?

422
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,039
I'll drive into the city
and bring him back myself.

423
00:18:45,073 --> 00:18:46,181
I know the city.
I can get him.

424
00:18:46,215 --> 00:18:48,275
You're the one
who lost him.

425
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,885
Relax, girlfriend, I'm
just trying to help.

426
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,697
I'm not your girlfriend.
I'm not your friend.
I don't even know you.

427
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,039
You don't?
My mom thinks you do.

428
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:58,110
Uh, I mean,
I was joking.

429
00:18:58,144 --> 00:18:59,787
'Cause, like,
I do know her.

430
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:01,772
We're just not...
besties.

431
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,933
Why don't we all
go get Trey?

432
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,617
No. Your parents
would kill me.

433
00:19:05,652 --> 00:19:08,954
They'll kill you when
they find out a total
stranger is watching us.

434
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:10,681
And who's gonna
tell them?

435
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,896
Anybody have to
go to the bathroom?

436
00:19:25,689 --> 00:19:28,249
No, we can't.

437
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:30,125
Are you gonna fit
all of us in your car?

438
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,935
Okay, but...

439
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,896
BOTH: I'll drive.

440
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,080
- I'll drive!
- Thanks.

441
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:44,798
( bicycle bell rings )

442
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,068
Okay, we just got passed,

443
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,244
- ( horns honking )
- by a bicycle.

444
00:19:49,278 --> 00:19:50,871
I am not adding
a speeding ticket

445
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:52,297
and a stolen car
to this disaster.

446
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:55,234
- ( horns blaring )
- BOBBY: Can we stop at
the grocery store?

447
00:19:55,268 --> 00:19:57,119
No, I told you.
We're going to get Trey,

448
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,155
and then we're heading
straight home.

449
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:00,898
If anyone asks,
where did we go, people?

450
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:03,150
ALL: Ice cream.

451
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:08,555
You know, a professional
manicure could do
your hands wonders.

452
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:10,516
- How old are you?
- Seven.

453
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,878
You know what I was doing
with my hands when I was seven?

454
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,354
No, and she doesn't
want to.

455
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:16,538
At least pretend
to set an example.

456
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:19,700
- Smile, Jenny.
- This is no time
for pictures.

457
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:22,794
It is always
the time for pictures.
Art is spontaneous.

458
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:24,296
- So say cheese!
- No!

459
00:20:27,718 --> 00:20:29,301
( barking )

460
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,181
( loud rumbling )

461
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:47,811
JENNY: Okay, guys,
we find this pawn shop,

462
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,488
get Trey, and get home
as fast as possible.

463
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,337
GPS VOICE:<i>  Turn left,</i>
<i>600 feet.</i>

464
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:15,014
<i>Turn left.</i>

465
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,552
Are you sure
this is right?

466
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:30,621
Well, yeah, that's what
the GPS says.

467
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:32,072
<i>Turn left</i>
<i>in 200 feet.</i>

468
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:37,286
- Hey, puddle!
- ( screaming )

469
00:21:39,347 --> 00:21:42,107
That was close.
If anything happens

470
00:21:42,141 --> 00:21:43,683
to this car,
we're dead.

471
00:21:43,718 --> 00:21:46,628
<i>Approaching destination</i>
<i>on left.</i>

472
00:21:46,663 --> 00:21:47,855
There it is,
there it is.

473
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,014
Park here, park here.

474
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:50,341
- Park here.
- Okay!

475
00:21:55,404 --> 00:21:58,040
Okay, you guys wait here.
I'll go.

476
00:21:58,074 --> 00:22:00,876
- Um, Jenny.
- Oh, Katy.

477
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,995
Why didn't you go
before we left?

478
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,964
I didn't have to go
before we left, obviously.

479
00:22:05,998 --> 00:22:08,350
It's okay.
I'll take her.

480
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,952
No. Babysitting rule
number two:

481
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:11,845
Leave no child behind.

482
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:12,821
Come on, kids,
let's go.

483
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:17,451
- LOLA: Cool car.
- JENNY: Yes, it's lovely.

484
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,763
Yeah, yeah,
we're all set.

485
00:22:21,797 --> 00:22:25,300
Midnight. We bring the varmint,
you bring the 100 grand cash.

486
00:22:25,334 --> 00:22:28,120
Yeah, yeah, 100 grand.

487
00:22:28,154 --> 00:22:29,546
Look, this is
a sapphire ferret.

488
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,124
There's only three of them
in the whole entire world.

489
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:33,550
You want me to make it
200 grand?

490
00:22:36,904 --> 00:22:40,515
All right then.
Midnight.

491
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,827
No funny business.
I gotta go.

492
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,078
What do you kids want?

493
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,931
This place is so cool.
It's so rustic.

494
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:49,366
Hey, no pictures.

495
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,176
Watch the camera, man.

496
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,844
Hi. We are looking for Tiny.

497
00:22:52,878 --> 00:22:56,323
I'm Tiny.
Who wants to know?

498
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:58,300
My name is Jenny Parker.
I'm a babysitter,

499
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,503
and we are looking for
a teenage boy.

500
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,329
He came here earlier to buy
some concert tickets.

501
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:04,832
Oh, yeah.
You want the Scalper.

502
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:06,583
Make it quick.

503
00:23:09,128 --> 00:23:11,104
Uh, you know what?
That's okay.

504
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,824
He looks busy.
We can wait.

505
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:15,885
No, we can't.
Let's go.

506
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,928
Thanks, dude.

507
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:27,187
Let go.

508
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:39,491
Stay ahead.
Stay ahead of me.

511
00:24:07,587 --> 00:24:10,797
Hi there, Mr. Scalper sir.

512
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:12,791
Sorry to interrupt

513
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,452
your little martial arts
routine there,

514
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:17,312
but did you happen to sell
Psychic Rockets tickets

515
00:24:17,346 --> 00:24:18,872
to a kid
earlier today?

516
00:24:18,907 --> 00:24:20,574
Maybe I did.

517
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:23,810
Maybe I didn't.

518
00:24:23,844 --> 00:24:26,580
Well, maybe if
we called the cops,

519
00:24:26,614 --> 00:24:28,340
and told them there's
a weird scary dude

520
00:24:28,374 --> 00:24:30,942
with a sword selling tickets
to minors,

521
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,419
would you remember him then?

522
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,889
Kid paid with ones.

523
00:24:35,924 --> 00:24:38,467
I hate ones.

524
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:43,472
Hey, little guy.
Hungry?

525
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:56,618
Kid said something
about pizza.

526
00:24:56,653 --> 00:24:58,970
I hate pizza.

527
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:00,781
Pizza? That's great.

528
00:25:00,815 --> 00:25:04,209
That narrows it down
to about, I don't know,
4,000 restaurants.

529
00:25:04,243 --> 00:25:07,637
Mario's. It's his favorite
pizza place.

530
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,566
I mean, if I was
gonna guess.

531
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,669
Guessing? Is that what
they call stalking
these days?

532
00:25:17,656 --> 00:25:19,958
Jenny!

533
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:22,293
Bobby, what are you doing?

534
00:25:22,328 --> 00:25:25,239
Bobby, calm down.
What is that, a weasel?

535
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,614
BOBBY: I don't know.

536
00:25:26,649 --> 00:25:29,143
JENNY: Kids,
don't touch it.

537
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:30,618
Kids, stay back.

538
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:32,212
LOLA: Hey, man.
Hey, watch it.

539
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:33,739
What are you doing?!

540
00:25:33,773 --> 00:25:34,731
Hey, the ferret's loose.

541
00:25:46,986 --> 00:25:48,128
I got him. Okay.

542
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:50,464
Oh, I got him.

543
00:25:50,498 --> 00:25:52,374
That's so cool.
Smile.

544
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:54,151
Hey, I said
no more pictures.

545
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:55,594
JENNY: Lola,
no means no.

546
00:25:55,628 --> 00:25:58,539
TINY: Get the ferret.
Don't let the ferret get away.

547
00:25:58,573 --> 00:26:01,867
The car's being towed.
Let's go!

548
00:26:01,901 --> 00:26:04,052
- Where'd it go?
- ( kids screaming )

549
00:26:06,322 --> 00:26:08,115
JENNY: Hey, wait!

550
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,959
No, no, no.
Stop!

551
00:26:10,994 --> 00:26:12,227
No, really, stop.

552
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:15,506
Okay, go.
Hi, sorry.

553
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,540
We did not see the sign.
This isn't even my car.

554
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,410
If you could just
please unhook it,

555
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,270
- we're here now.
- Sure, for 100 bucks.

556
00:26:21,304 --> 00:26:23,129
100 bucks?
That's highway robbery.

557
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,348
- We should have you towed.
- ( revs engine )

558
00:26:25,382 --> 00:26:27,275
No, that's fine.
100 bucks.

559
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,819
- Debit card is like
cash, right?
- Yeah.

560
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,721
Oh, no. My purse.

561
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,565
I left it at
the Andersons.

562
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,676
If you could just please
give us the car now,

563
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:36,802
I promise you I will
give you the money tomorrow.

564
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:38,445
I don't do layaway, kid.

565
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:41,348
Okay, does anyone
have any money?

566
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:43,150
Why do you think
I'm babysitting?

567
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,343
I close at midnight.

568
00:26:45,377 --> 00:26:47,387
But you can't just
leave us stranded here.

569
00:26:47,422 --> 00:26:49,531
I mean, we're just kids.

570
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,266
- Time to grow up.
- LOLA: Seriously?

571
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:53,209
No, wait.
Don't go!

572
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,519
( kids screaming )

573
00:26:58,165 --> 00:27:00,342
Hey, you better
wash that.

574
00:27:00,376 --> 00:27:03,237
BOBBY: That's my mom's car!

575
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:05,172
Well, what now?

576
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,740
( sighs )

577
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:11,886
Great.

578
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,439
Anybody got
any bright ideas?

579
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:16,833
It's fine.
It's totally
under control.

580
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,660
We've just got no car,
no money,

581
00:27:18,695 --> 00:27:21,288
no Trey, and we need
100 bucks by midnight.

582
00:27:21,322 --> 00:27:23,657
It's doable.
It's totally doable.

583
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:25,234
Wait, what about
the ice cream money?

584
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,376
Yes, great thinking.

585
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,962
Um...

586
00:27:28,996 --> 00:27:30,297
Ten bucks.
What's that gonna do?

587
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:33,241
I saw a bus stop
a few blocks over.

588
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,526
We take the bus
to Mario's,

589
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,245
get Trey,
and by then,

590
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,071
I'll figure out
what I'm gonna do next.

591
00:27:38,105 --> 00:27:40,207
Okay. Whatever you say.

592
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,975
Let's go.

593
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:43,118
- Jenny.
- Yeah.

594
00:27:43,153 --> 00:27:45,261
I'm scared.

595
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,064
Sweetie, there's...

596
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,139
nothing to be
scared of.

597
00:27:48,174 --> 00:27:50,584
( sirens wailing )

598
00:27:50,618 --> 00:27:52,510
How can you snack
right now?

599
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,504
I'm not snacking.
I'm taste testing.

600
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:56,140
Where did you get
the candy?

601
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,958
Uh, in the pawn shop.

602
00:27:57,992 --> 00:28:01,086
- Bobby, you took candy
from a stranger?
- They were in a bowl.

603
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,848
- I thought
they were free.
- ( frustrated sigh )

604
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:07,066
- Hey!
- I guess they
weren't free.

605
00:28:07,101 --> 00:28:08,644
You kids are in
big trouble.

606
00:28:08,678 --> 00:28:10,429
- What do we do?
What do we do?
- Run!

607
00:28:10,463 --> 00:28:12,556
( horn honking )

608
00:28:15,551 --> 00:28:17,770
Are they still chasing us?

609
00:28:17,804 --> 00:28:21,522
( screaming )

610
00:28:21,557 --> 00:28:24,459
We can't lose those kids.

611
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,020
They got a picture of me
with the sapphire ferret,

612
00:28:27,054 --> 00:28:29,581
which would prove
that we stole it.

613
00:28:29,615 --> 00:28:32,401
I'm not goin'
back to jail.

614
00:28:32,435 --> 00:28:34,619
We can get 'em
at that pizza place.

615
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,496
JENNY: Hurry, guys.
Let's run.

616
00:28:45,531 --> 00:28:46,782
KATY: These shoes
aren't made for running.

617
00:28:46,816 --> 00:28:48,842
JENNY: Children,
everyone, on the bus.
Go, go, go, go.

618
00:28:52,112 --> 00:28:54,381
Good evening,
kind sir.

619
00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:56,883
Six kids.
That's 12 bucks.

620
00:28:56,918 --> 00:29:00,061
Is it 12 now?
My, my, how times have changed.

621
00:29:00,095 --> 00:29:01,954
Uh, let's just call it
close enough. Yeah?

622
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:04,440
- Let's not.
- Okay, well,

623
00:29:04,475 --> 00:29:06,851
the thing is, uh... Karl,

624
00:29:06,886 --> 00:29:09,320
we're having, like,
a minor situation tonight.

625
00:29:09,355 --> 00:29:12,474
You see, thanks to Jenny,

626
00:29:12,508 --> 00:29:14,543
the world's greatest
babysitter here,

627
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:16,870
we don't have
any additional actual money.

628
00:29:16,904 --> 00:29:18,780
- So...
- Don't listen
to her, Karl.

629
00:29:18,814 --> 00:29:20,089
This whole fiasco
is her fault.

630
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:23,610
I think we can all
stop pointing fingers
and worry about Trey.

631
00:29:23,644 --> 00:29:24,853
Don't pretend to care
about Trey.

632
00:29:24,887 --> 00:29:27,589
Honestly, Karl, she
doesn't care about
anybody but herself.

633
00:29:27,624 --> 00:29:29,615
I care about
a lot of things, Karl,

634
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,101
- like art and expression
and photography.
- PASSENGER: Let's go.

635
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:35,672
I bet she didn't even
know who Leon Vasquez
was until today.

636
00:29:35,706 --> 00:29:37,124
I did too.
I read all about him.

637
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:39,233
Please, I saw your portfolio.
It's as stiff as you are.

638
00:29:39,268 --> 00:29:42,187
Where'd you learn to
take pictures, sweetheart,
your computer?

639
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:44,789
Where'd you learn
all this snappy sarcasm?
We know it wasn't college.

640
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,075
Enough! Get on
and zip it!

641
00:29:47,109 --> 00:29:48,202
If you could just
send me the address,

642
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:50,153
- I'd be happy to
send you the balance.
- Sit!

643
00:30:06,395 --> 00:30:08,472
Hey, guys.

644
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,348
A.J.? What are
you doing here?

645
00:30:10,382 --> 00:30:12,543
Trey Anderson, freeze.

646
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,961
- Who's that?
- His babysitter.

647
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:16,571
You have a babysitter?
I want a babysitter.

648
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:17,889
She's hot.

649
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,235
You are so lucky
we found you.

650
00:30:22,269 --> 00:30:23,770
Hey, Jenny.
You look great.

651
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,165
Hi, Trey.

652
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,716
Please don't
rat me out, Jenny.

653
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,227
I'll be grounded
for life.

654
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,611
Probably till
you're 18.

655
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:33,522
- Who are you?
- Lola.

656
00:30:33,556 --> 00:30:35,815
Technically,
I'm your babysitter,

657
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,992
so thanks for making me
look bad, by the way.

658
00:30:37,026 --> 00:30:40,770
You didn't need help for that.
Come on, Trey, let's go.

659
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:43,881
- What about the concert?
- There's no way you're
going to that concert.

660
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:46,893
Besides, we have
much bigger problems
to deal with right now.

661
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,445
Jenny got Mom's
new car towed.

662
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,974
- You drove my mom's
car into the city?
- To get you,

663
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,000
and now we need $100
to get it back by midnight.

664
00:30:54,034 --> 00:30:57,079
- I don't suppose you
losers have any money.
- I spent it all on tickets.

665
00:30:57,113 --> 00:31:00,448
That's it. Why don't we just
scalp Trey's concert ticket

666
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,692
to get the cash
for the car?

667
00:31:02,726 --> 00:31:04,411
You mean,
sell it ourselves?

668
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:07,230
Exactly. Brilliant.

669
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,374
- Wait. It's mine.
- Oh, cool.

670
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,159
So you wouldn't mind
explaining to your mother

671
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,177
that her car got towed
and her precious children

672
00:31:12,211 --> 00:31:16,206
spent the night
sitting on a cold
park bench in the city.

673
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,149
I have a better idea.

674
00:31:18,184 --> 00:31:22,328
Why don't we just
call her now, shall we?

675
00:31:22,363 --> 00:31:25,373
Oh, Helen.
( sighs )

676
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,723
This is so not fair.

677
00:31:33,757 --> 00:31:35,383
Life isn't fair, kid.

678
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,130
Jenny, I really have to
go to the bathroom.

679
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,157
Okay.

680
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,951
Everyone, stay put.

681
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,953
Hey, Bobby,
check this out.

682
00:31:46,987 --> 00:31:49,021
Oh, that's so cool.

683
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:51,199
Bummer about the concert.

684
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:54,411
Dude, forget the concert.
Go for Jenny.

685
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,505
She was totally
checking you out, too.

686
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,113
- She was?
- Yeah.

687
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,520
I'm going to
the tattoo place.

688
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,038
Cool. Have fun.
Go express yourself.

689
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:15,432
- Thanks for the zip.
- Not even a problem.

690
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,509
Lucky you had
a safety pin.

691
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:19,527
I know. Right?

692
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,521
So did you hear
who Zac Chase

693
00:32:21,555 --> 00:32:23,031
is taking to
the concert tonight?

694
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:24,424
- No. Who?
- Guess.

695
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,450
- Who?
- Guess.

696
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:27,394
- Who?
- Dominique Cassidy.

697
00:32:27,428 --> 00:32:29,854
No!

698
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:36,494
Jenny Parker.
Is that really you?

699
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:39,072
Hey, girls.

700
00:32:39,106 --> 00:32:41,366
Whoa! I never would've
thought to see you

701
00:32:41,401 --> 00:32:43,468
in the city
on a Friday night.

702
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,262
Really? Why not?
It's the weekend, right?

703
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,939
- I live for fun.
- Right.

704
00:32:47,973 --> 00:32:49,482
So who are you
here with?

705
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:51,551
Just some friends.

706
00:32:51,585 --> 00:32:52,886
They're city friends.

707
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,830
They're really
mature friends.

708
00:32:54,864 --> 00:32:56,172
You probably
wouldn't know them.

709
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:02,437
Help. I'm all twisted.

710
00:33:02,471 --> 00:33:04,531
Oh, poor little girl.

711
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,915
Where's your mommy?

712
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:08,568
I'll go help you
find her.

713
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,145
- I have to wash my hands.
- You can use sanitizer.

714
00:33:16,652 --> 00:33:18,436
Where'd everybody go?

715
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,480
Bobby?

716
00:33:20,514 --> 00:33:21,815
A.J.?

717
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:23,925
- Smile.
- Lola.

718
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:27,212
- Where are the kids?
- Uh, specifically,
I don't know. Around.

719
00:33:27,246 --> 00:33:31,023
- Around? Are you
out of your mind?
- Possibly.

720
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:34,110
Babysitting rule
number one: Never take
your eyes off the kids.

721
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,904
Trey, A.J., Bobby.

722
00:33:36,939 --> 00:33:39,065
Uh, where's Emily?

723
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,708
Uh, she's getting
a tattoo.

724
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:41,943
Getting a what?!

725
00:33:41,977 --> 00:33:44,179
A tattoo.

726
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:49,184
TINY: In and out
like stealth ninjas.

727
00:33:51,153 --> 00:33:52,720
Emily, are you okay?

728
00:33:52,755 --> 00:33:55,515
Please, please tell me
you did not just
get a tattoo.

729
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:57,801
What? It's henna.

730
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,245
The guy did it for free
'cause he liked my aura.

731
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,322
- Cool, right?
- Super cool.

732
00:34:02,356 --> 00:34:06,768
So not super cool.
How could you do that
without asking me?

733
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:08,177
- I asked Lola.
- She did.

734
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,305
Lola... Lola
is nobody, okay?

735
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,699
You can't just
wander off like that.

736
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:13,909
Something could've
happened to you.

737
00:34:13,943 --> 00:34:16,702
You are my responsibility,
okay?

738
00:34:16,737 --> 00:34:18,521
And that better come off
with soap and water.

739
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:22,217
- Uh, Jenny.
- What, Bobby?

740
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:29,975
- Please don't let
them get me.
- Go, go, go, go!

741
00:34:30,009 --> 00:34:31,493
Go, go, go, go!

742
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,561
BOBBY: Go! Come on!

743
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:37,273
TREY: Why are the pawn shop
guys after us?

744
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,192
KATY: Bobby stole
a candy bar.

745
00:34:39,226 --> 00:34:41,194
- So give it back.
- I can't, I licked it.

746
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:47,200
- Come this way.
- Bobby!

747
00:34:53,907 --> 00:34:55,125
There.

748
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,796
Go this way.

749
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:04,751
Sh, sh, sh!

750
00:35:04,785 --> 00:35:05,802
( door creaks open,
slams shut )

751
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,844
They went this way.

752
00:35:22,878 --> 00:35:23,928
You don't know
what way they went.

753
00:35:23,963 --> 00:35:26,072
Sh, sh!

754
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,954
( alarm blares )

755
00:35:43,082 --> 00:35:44,174
We know you're
in here.

756
00:36:07,189 --> 00:36:11,034
Just wanna have
a reasonable conversation.

757
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,870
SCALPER: Yeah, we're
very reasonable people.

758
00:36:20,286 --> 00:36:22,278
TINY: We locked the doors.

759
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,964
There's no way out.

760
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:58,915
- JENNY: Get down. Lola.
- No way out!

761
00:36:58,949 --> 00:37:01,476
We're not leaving
till we get that camera.

762
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,437
My camera?

763
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:06,389
These guys are crazy.

764
00:37:06,423 --> 00:37:08,658
We need to find
another way out.

765
00:37:08,692 --> 00:37:10,260
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

766
00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:21,312
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

767
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,617
That's them.
Come on!

768
00:37:36,912 --> 00:37:37,829
KATY: Go away!
Leave us alone!

769
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:44,226
Get down!
Stop the belt.

770
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:46,229
BOBBY: Pick on someone
your own size.

771
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:48,723
You're makin' me jump.

772
00:37:48,757 --> 00:37:49,424
You're not gettin'
my camera.

773
00:37:51,193 --> 00:37:52,135
Give me the camera.

774
00:37:55,197 --> 00:37:57,456
- ( blows raspberry )
- Nice going!

775
00:37:57,491 --> 00:37:58,850
Hey, kids.

776
00:38:01,086 --> 00:38:03,238
- ( laughing )
- JENNY: Careful.

777
00:38:03,272 --> 00:38:06,416
TREY: With your legs,
with your legs.

778
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,900
Let's go.

779
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:16,109
TREY: This is so cool. Whoo!

780
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:17,944
KATY: Come on, guys,
let's hurry.

781
00:38:17,978 --> 00:38:20,396
Okay, let's go.
Come on.

782
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:21,848
Come on.

783
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,249
Let's go.

784
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,889
BOBBY: Hey, look out!

785
00:39:01,864 --> 00:39:03,831
Go! Go, go, go.

786
00:39:08,704 --> 00:39:10,129
Go, go. Right.

787
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:21,641
We can't get around this, guys.
There's no way out.

788
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:23,084
Yeah, there is.

789
00:39:23,118 --> 00:39:24,685
There's an awesome
way out.

790
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,265
Oh, yeah!

791
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:31,317
- No, no, no.
- Yeah.

792
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:34,095
HELEN: What an incredible
party.

793
00:39:34,129 --> 00:39:36,130
I can't believe
this is all for me.

794
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,798
Well, you deserve
it all.

795
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,293
There's Barry and Donna.
Let's say hello.

796
00:39:40,327 --> 00:39:42,036
I should give
the kids a call though.

797
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:44,330
Oh, honey,
they're fine.

798
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:45,924
I don't know.
A.J. was so upset

799
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:47,867
about missing
the Roller Derby match.

800
00:39:47,901 --> 00:39:49,402
She must be miserable
and bored.

801
00:39:49,436 --> 00:39:51,712
- Are you ready?
- You bet.

802
00:39:56,443 --> 00:39:58,378
How did you learn
how to do that?

803
00:39:58,412 --> 00:39:59,137
How do you think
I got off the roof?

804
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,186
This outfit is so going
to need dry cleaning.

805
00:40:09,864 --> 00:40:12,884
Your parents are never
going to ask me to
babysit again.

806
00:40:12,918 --> 00:40:14,402
If they do, I'd ask
for ten bucks more an hour.

807
00:40:18,932 --> 00:40:21,525
- Ready?
- Okay.

808
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:22,910
Jenny!

809
00:40:24,246 --> 00:40:25,371
Right there.

810
00:40:45,517 --> 00:40:47,977
- TINY: Who turned out
the lights?
- Here I come.

811
00:40:51,056 --> 00:40:53,290
- Is everyone okay?
- ( all saying yes )

812
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:53,900
Let's go sell
that ticket.

813
00:40:56,486 --> 00:40:59,914
TINY: You're on my leg.
My leg, my leg.

814
00:40:59,948 --> 00:41:00,406
I'm having trouble
breathing.

815
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,844
What just happened?

816
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:15,004
I hate kids.

817
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,967
We could still get 'em
at that concert.

818
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:22,136
Yeah.

819
00:41:29,953 --> 00:41:31,545
LOLA: Okay, I'm gonna do it.

820
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:34,198
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

821
00:41:34,233 --> 00:41:37,443
Yeah, people sell
concert tickets every day.
It's no big deal.

822
00:41:37,477 --> 00:41:40,972
Here, kid.
Guard this with your
life, okay?

823
00:41:41,006 --> 00:41:42,248
You can trust me.
I'm a Derby girl.

824
00:41:42,282 --> 00:41:44,158
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

825
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,684
We'll just be over
here by the taco cart.

826
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,962
Oh, tacos.

827
00:41:47,996 --> 00:41:52,399
Maybe my cupcakes
could use some heat.

828
00:41:52,434 --> 00:41:54,210
Jenny, sit on this.

829
00:41:58,932 --> 00:42:01,843
Thanks, Trey.
So thoughtful.

830
00:42:01,877 --> 00:42:03,802
Hundred bucks?

831
00:42:03,837 --> 00:42:06,238
Hey, tickets.
Just 100 bucks.

832
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,640
How about you, beautiful?
a ticket, 100 bucks?

833
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,268
What are you doing, A.J.?
Please be careful.

834
00:42:11,303 --> 00:42:12,728
It's the Swift trip chop.

835
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,413
A right chop
with a back spin.

836
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,548
It's Jailer Swift's
signature move.

837
00:42:15,582 --> 00:42:16,649
Like that would
ever work.

838
00:42:22,155 --> 00:42:23,289
Ticket, ticket.
Hundred bucks. Ticket.

839
00:42:23,323 --> 00:42:26,793
- Concert ticket,
hundred bucks.
- There she is.

840
00:42:26,827 --> 00:42:28,894
Hey, hey.
Hundred bucks, concert ticket.

841
00:42:28,929 --> 00:42:31,197
No, how about you?

842
00:42:31,231 --> 00:42:32,623
Hundred bucks?
You got one already.

843
00:42:32,657 --> 00:42:37,086
Reselling a ticket
at the site of a venue
is illegal.

844
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:40,898
Did I say sell?
I meant donate.

845
00:42:40,932 --> 00:42:43,893
I was gonna donate
this ticket to a very
deserving person, officer.

846
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:45,953
Oh, no, no,
not the police.

847
00:42:45,987 --> 00:42:48,631
- Sounds like you're
trying to bribe me.
- No, no, no.

848
00:42:48,665 --> 00:42:49,599
Oh, no!

849
00:42:52,627 --> 00:42:54,161
Stupid kid.
Nabbed by the cops.

850
00:42:54,195 --> 00:42:55,021
I see that.

851
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:59,909
- Come on.
- Oh, but, sir, I didn't
do it, I swear.

852
00:42:59,943 --> 00:43:01,777
She'd want
a picture of this.

853
00:43:12,765 --> 00:43:14,565
Excuse me, ma'am.

854
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:16,609
We're looking for
our friend Lola.

855
00:43:16,643 --> 00:43:19,162
She's 19, dark hair,
snappy attitude.

856
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:19,954
Yeah, she's getting booked.

857
00:43:19,988 --> 00:43:21,848
Booked?

858
00:43:21,882 --> 00:43:25,200
- Is that, like, arrested?
- Like yep.

859
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:28,128
Have a seat, and we'll
call you when we're
done processing her.

860
00:43:28,163 --> 00:43:32,258
Uh, fat man called Tiny
and a tall, skinny guy

861
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:34,743
- with a hat.
- Hood.

862
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,787
And a weird little
furry animal thing.

863
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:37,830
Maybe a ferret.
I don't know.

864
00:43:37,864 --> 00:43:40,633
( sighs )

865
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:42,610
You are aware that lying
to an officer of the law

866
00:43:42,644 --> 00:43:44,704
is also a crime.

867
00:43:44,738 --> 00:43:46,981
You are aware
I'm not lying, officer.

868
00:43:47,015 --> 00:43:48,240
It's gonna be
a long night, kid.

869
00:43:53,188 --> 00:43:54,355
I'm never gonna find
the perfect ingredient

870
00:43:54,389 --> 00:43:56,666
in time for
the contest.

871
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,978
Quit your whining.
I'm missing the biggest
rivalry in Roller Derby history.

872
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,788
Both of you
quit your whining.

873
00:44:02,823 --> 00:44:04,448
I'm missing the biggest
concert of the year.

874
00:44:04,483 --> 00:44:08,443
Hey, everyone quit whining.
Just sit and be quiet
so I can think.

875
00:44:08,478 --> 00:44:11,330
You're smart,
you are calm,

876
00:44:11,364 --> 00:44:12,823
you always have the answers.

877
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,741
Hey, Jenny.
Can't we just call

878
00:44:14,776 --> 00:44:16,477
one of your friends
for help?

879
00:44:16,512 --> 00:44:19,313
My friends are busy
studying.

880
00:44:19,348 --> 00:44:21,140
What about
your parents?

881
00:44:21,174 --> 00:44:22,650
I told you,
they're out of town.

882
00:44:24,485 --> 00:44:26,562
Emily, what did you do?

883
00:44:26,596 --> 00:44:28,205
Nothing. It's just
a little hair dye.

884
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:30,049
Just a little
bit of hair dye?

885
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,592
Just a little tattoo.
What is wrong with you?

886
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,969
Why are you being
so irresponsible?

887
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,553
I'm not irresponsible.

888
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,388
You're just making
everything worse.

889
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,790
Now go sit with
the other kids

890
00:44:37,825 --> 00:44:38,499
so I can figure
out what to do.

891
00:45:07,904 --> 00:45:09,805
Okay, you wanted to
teach me a lesson,

892
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,365
and I get it.
I'm sorry.

893
00:45:11,399 --> 00:45:13,459
Can I go now?

894
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,386
I'm not entirely convinced
you do get it, young lady.

895
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:19,056
You have more than a few
violations on your record.

896
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,968
Parking tickets,
not bank robberies.

897
00:45:22,002 --> 00:45:22,752
This girl giving you
trouble, officer?

898
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:30,376
Next time, keep the fighting
in the rink

899
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:31,911
and not
the parking lot.

900
00:45:31,945 --> 00:45:34,063
- They started it.
- Yeah, and we're
gonna finish it.

901
00:45:34,097 --> 00:45:36,273
Enough already.
You three, over there.

902
00:45:36,307 --> 00:45:37,767
The other three, there.

903
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:42,605
All right.
Thank you.

904
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:49,170
It's Jailer Swift.

905
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,880
It's you.

906
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,450
- You're my hero.
- Yeah?

907
00:45:54,484 --> 00:45:57,628
I've been trying
to learn the Swift
trip chop for six months.

908
00:45:57,662 --> 00:45:58,204
Let's see what you got.

909
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:03,801
Not bad, kid, not bad.

910
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:04,535
But you need some more torque
on that back spin.

911
00:46:04,569 --> 00:46:06,462
Like so.

912
00:46:14,379 --> 00:46:15,471
( man snoring )

913
00:46:18,992 --> 00:46:19,934
( snoring loudly )

914
00:46:28,901 --> 00:46:30,469
Congratulations, Helen.

915
00:46:30,503 --> 00:46:32,897
- Hey. How are you?
- Hi.

916
00:46:32,931 --> 00:46:34,890
- I'm so proud of her.
- I know.

917
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:36,492
( phone buzzing )

918
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,197
Mom, help.

919
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,549
Jenny stole the Andersons'
new car,

920
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:45,517
and got us all arrested.

921
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,919
We're downtown
in the city... ( yells )

922
00:46:54,461 --> 00:46:56,387
You were right.

923
00:46:56,421 --> 00:46:57,605
Except for the parking
tickets, you're clean.

924
00:46:57,639 --> 00:46:59,173
See, I told you.
I'm not a felon.

925
00:46:59,207 --> 00:47:01,250
I'm just an innocent
babysitter.

926
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:03,910
And what kind of example
do you think you're setting
for those kids up there?

927
00:47:03,945 --> 00:47:06,772
- You think it's
one big joke?
- No.

928
00:47:06,806 --> 00:47:09,175
Trying to sell concert tickets
may not be a felony,
but it's dangerous.

929
00:47:09,209 --> 00:47:11,635
Some thug could've
snatched those tickets
and your wallet.

930
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,329
Then what?

931
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,615
I don't know. I guess
I didn't really think of that.

932
00:47:15,649 --> 00:47:16,448
No, you didn't.

933
00:47:18,977 --> 00:47:22,262
Look, you're
a smart girl.

934
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,847
But you need to start
thinking about your actions.

935
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,991
Those kids up there,
they look up to you.

936
00:47:26,025 --> 00:47:27,868
They wanna be you.

937
00:47:27,902 --> 00:47:30,621
They don't even
know me.

938
00:47:30,655 --> 00:47:33,566
I'm not even
their real babysitter.

939
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,442
I lied to get the job,

940
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,127
and I lied to you
earlier.

941
00:47:37,162 --> 00:47:42,124
Officer, I'm not
a Furry Lisa-loving
college student.

942
00:47:42,158 --> 00:47:43,642
I never even heard of
Furry Lisa before today.

943
00:47:43,677 --> 00:47:46,170
"Fur Elise."
Beethoven.

944
00:47:46,204 --> 00:47:48,013
- Right.
- Doesn't matter.

945
00:47:48,048 --> 00:47:49,890
The truth is,
I wanted to go to art school,

946
00:47:49,925 --> 00:47:51,241
but my grades
weren't good enough to get in,

947
00:47:51,275 --> 00:47:52,827
so I didn't even try.

948
00:47:52,861 --> 00:47:55,546
And now I'm up for this amazing
photography internship

949
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,272
with my idol, and...

950
00:47:57,306 --> 00:48:01,168
if I get it, then
I'll have another chance
to make things right.

951
00:48:01,202 --> 00:48:03,812
I really am an artist,

952
00:48:03,846 --> 00:48:06,649
and I really am
a good photographer.

953
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:08,192
And I'm really sorry
I lied to you,

954
00:48:08,226 --> 00:48:09,785
but you're kinda sorta
super cute,

955
00:48:09,819 --> 00:48:11,954
and I know I always
make mistakes,

956
00:48:11,988 --> 00:48:13,798
and I know this
was a big mistake,

957
00:48:13,832 --> 00:48:16,592
but I just...

958
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,093
I don't think
I belong in jail.

959
00:48:20,422 --> 00:48:21,655
Neither do I.

960
00:48:21,689 --> 00:48:23,390
You don't?

961
00:48:23,424 --> 00:48:25,609
No.

962
00:48:25,643 --> 00:48:27,711
Oh, thank you. Sorry.

963
00:48:27,745 --> 00:48:29,371
So do you need any help
getting those kids home?

964
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,306
- Can I call
their parents--
- No!

965
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,608
- No, we're good.
But thank you.
- Okay.

966
00:48:34,936 --> 00:48:37,904
Let's see if
your friends
are up here.

967
00:48:37,939 --> 00:48:40,332
- Oh, there they are.
- Lola!

968
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:42,076
You're okay!

969
00:48:43,786 --> 00:48:46,080
Hi, Katy.
Hi, cutie.

970
00:48:49,634 --> 00:48:52,970
- Lola!
- Hi. You guys came.

971
00:48:53,005 --> 00:48:54,046
Say cheese.

972
00:48:56,374 --> 00:48:57,783
- Stop pushing.
- You're blocking my face!

973
00:48:57,817 --> 00:48:58,592
I'll block your face
with my foot.

974
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:08,143
Come on now.

975
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,816
You guys, get out
of here now. Go, go!

976
00:49:18,571 --> 00:49:20,539
TINY: We gotta
get that camera.

977
00:49:20,573 --> 00:49:22,282
SCALPER: We'll get it.
No matter what.

978
00:49:22,316 --> 00:49:25,627
Look at that. That little one,
she's got the camera.

979
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:27,504
Get her.
Go, go, go.

980
00:49:27,538 --> 00:49:29,915
JENNY: Come on, guys.

981
00:49:29,949 --> 00:49:32,718
Lola, are you okay?
Was it scary?
Did they hurt you?

982
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:34,528
No, I'm totally fine.

983
00:49:34,562 --> 00:49:37,689
Fine? You just
got arrested.

984
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,274
It's fine, Jenny.
Relax. It's not a big deal.

985
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,250
This has gone way beyond
sneaking out to a concert.

986
00:49:40,285 --> 00:49:42,511
You guys, I'm sorry,
but we have to call
your parents.

987
00:49:42,545 --> 00:49:45,122
- ALL: No!
- You're just gonna
give up, just like that?

988
00:49:45,156 --> 00:49:47,842
It's called
being responsible.
You should try it sometime.

989
00:49:47,876 --> 00:49:49,292
And you should try
loosening up.

990
00:49:49,327 --> 00:49:50,903
Be in the moment.

991
00:49:50,937 --> 00:49:52,838
Hey, little girl.
Come here.

992
00:49:52,872 --> 00:49:54,148
- Give me that camera.
- You wish!

993
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,544
It worked!

994
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,646
Hey, hey!

995
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,697
Guys!

996
00:50:04,659 --> 00:50:06,994
- ( Lola and Jenny
continue arguing )
- Get her!

997
00:50:14,186 --> 00:50:16,586
Uh, hey, you guys.

998
00:50:16,621 --> 00:50:19,598
- BOTH: What, Bobby?
- Uh, A.J.

999
00:50:19,633 --> 00:50:22,543
Oh, no, A.J.

1000
00:50:22,577 --> 00:50:25,262
- Help, police!
- Help!

1001
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,726
A.J.

1002
00:50:32,412 --> 00:50:33,953
That's their car.

1003
00:50:33,988 --> 00:50:36,147
Keys.
Let's take their car.

1004
00:50:36,182 --> 00:50:38,050
No, no,
that's stealing.

1005
00:50:38,084 --> 00:50:39,459
It's not stealing,
it's borrowing.

1006
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,345
Babysitting rule
number two:

1007
00:50:41,379 --> 00:50:43,447
Leave no child behind.
Or ahead, right? Yeah.

1008
00:50:46,117 --> 00:50:49,269
I can't believe that
you dragged me out of a party

1009
00:50:49,303 --> 00:50:51,130
for one of
Emily's pranks.

1010
00:50:51,164 --> 00:50:53,081
Police don't
arrest children.

1011
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:54,741
You heard the message.
She sounded terrified.

1012
00:50:54,775 --> 00:50:56,927
Taxi!

1013
00:50:56,961 --> 00:50:58,603
I'm sure they're
just at home,

1014
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,355
absolutely fine,
in front of the TV,

1015
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,775
watching some
ridiculous car chase.

1016
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,051
( tires screeching )

1017
00:51:05,086 --> 00:51:06,336
Hang on, A.J.
We'll save you.

1018
00:51:06,371 --> 00:51:09,431
Kids, this is not
how a responsible
babysitter behaves.

1019
00:51:12,893 --> 00:51:15,955
A.J.: Excuse me. Sorry.

1020
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,189
Hey, lady, look out.

1021
00:51:19,959 --> 00:51:20,859
SCALPER:
Out of the way!

1022
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,654
- LOLA: There he is.
- KATY: There's the big guy.

1023
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:32,671
- Get away from my sister.
- Yeah!

1024
00:51:32,706 --> 00:51:34,373
( panting )

1025
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:38,969
Hey, hey.
That's my car!

1026
00:51:39,003 --> 00:51:41,588
KATY: Faster, Lola,
faster!

1027
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,592
Look! There she is.

1028
00:51:49,205 --> 00:51:50,180
We can do this.
Come on.

1029
00:52:03,778 --> 00:52:04,820
LOLA: That was close.

1030
00:52:07,957 --> 00:52:10,033
Hey! That's our car!

1031
00:52:16,783 --> 00:52:18,684
Stupid ferret.

1032
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,585
You can do it, Tiny.

1033
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:22,871
Think of the money.
Think of the money.

1034
00:52:22,905 --> 00:52:25,090
Professor Helen Anderson.

1035
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:35,100
- And thank you so...
- ( cell phone rings )

1036
00:52:35,134 --> 00:52:37,169
Oh.

1037
00:52:37,203 --> 00:52:38,229
- ( ringing continues )
- Okay. Oops.

1038
00:52:38,263 --> 00:52:39,813
( line ringing )

1039
00:52:43,376 --> 00:52:45,985
( whispering )
My phone called
the Andersons.

1040
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,771
Hands free,
hands free.

1041
00:52:47,805 --> 00:52:50,749
Uh, sorry.
Babysitter.

1042
00:52:50,784 --> 00:52:52,201
( laughter )

1043
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:55,721
Hello. Hello?

1044
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,330
( both sputtering )

1045
00:52:57,365 --> 00:52:59,366
- Helen.
- ALL: Helen?

1046
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,176
Lola, is everything okay?

1047
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:04,196
Oh, totes.
Just checking in.

1048
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:06,181
You're checking in
with me?

1049
00:53:06,215 --> 00:53:07,974
I've never heard
of that before.

1050
00:53:08,008 --> 00:53:10,044
Uh, babysitter bonus.

1051
00:53:10,078 --> 00:53:11,511
It's part of
the premium package.

1052
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:13,806
Uh, okay, have fun. Bye.

1053
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,116
Bye. Thank you.

1054
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:17,926
Everything is fine.

1055
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,770
<i>Everything</i>  is fine.

1056
00:53:19,804 --> 00:53:22,072
And I'm fine.

1057
00:53:22,106 --> 00:53:24,290
Actually, I am...
I am more than fine.

1058
00:53:24,325 --> 00:53:26,292
Are you gonna
explain to Helen

1059
00:53:26,327 --> 00:53:27,828
why her best friends
missed her speech?

1060
00:53:27,862 --> 00:53:30,138
Whoa! Did you see that?

1061
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:33,717
What kind of parent
lets their kid roller skate
in the city after dark?

1062
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:35,577
- DONNA: That's unbelievable.
- The things you
see in this city.

1063
00:53:40,107 --> 00:53:41,500
There she is right there.

1064
00:53:41,534 --> 00:53:43,252
A.J.: Look out!

1065
00:53:45,447 --> 00:53:48,114
JENNY: Oh, my gosh, she's
headed for the picnic tables.

1066
00:53:48,148 --> 00:53:49,416
- A.J.!
- ( all yelling )

1067
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:50,842
Pick up your food.
Coming through.

1068
00:53:54,163 --> 00:53:56,181
Sorry!

1069
00:53:58,284 --> 00:53:59,685
- ALL: Yes!
- Nice, A.J.

1070
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,360
- Ooh!
- That's gotta hurt.

1071
00:54:11,213 --> 00:54:12,823
JENNY: There she is,
there she is.

1072
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,903
A.J., are you okay?

1073
00:54:17,937 --> 00:54:20,163
A.J., please tell me
you're okay.

1074
00:54:20,197 --> 00:54:22,048
Everything's good.
No scratches. Awesome.

1075
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:24,334
Move, move!

1076
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,038
You okay?

1077
00:54:28,072 --> 00:54:30,006
Okay, guys,
not okay.

1078
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:32,150
Not okay.
Not good.

Let's go!

1080

Really? You're worried
about your stupid camera?

1089
00:55:26,297 --> 00:55:28,449
It's not stupid.

1090
00:55:28,451 --> 00:55:30,383
I won this camera in
my first photography contest.

1091
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:32,236
This camera is proof
I have talent.

1092
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,488
Whatever. Come on.
Let's just go before
they come back, all right?

Sorry. Wrong place.
Bye.

1097
00:56:03,242 --> 00:56:05,318
Oh, no, no, no.
Stop in your tracks.

goin' nowhere

1100
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,758
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

1101
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:14,552
Step on my stage,
you gotta spill your rage.

1102
00:56:14,586 --> 00:56:17,748
My rage?
No, we're fine.

1103
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:18,757
There's nothing
to rage about.
Come on, kids.

1104
00:56:18,791 --> 00:56:20,659
Uh-uh-uh.

1105
00:56:20,693 --> 00:56:22,669
- Y'all know how we do.
- AUDIENCE: Yeah!

1106
00:56:22,703 --> 00:56:24,363
- It's double true.
- What?

1107
00:56:24,397 --> 00:56:26,281
'Cause if it's
your first time..

1109
00:56:30,002 --> 00:56:32,404
- What?
- Rap, Jenny.

1110
00:56:32,438 --> 00:56:35,523
- They want you to rap.
- I can't rap.
I'm a babysitter.

1111
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,592
Just say something.
Anything.

1112
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,723
LOLA: Just go.
Be creative.

1113
00:56:42,757 --> 00:56:44,299
Huh.

Hello.

We're in a lot of trouble...

00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:10,617
See, it all started
when our phones made a switch.

1124
00:57:10,651 --> 00:57:13,970
Lola lied to the parents.

1125
00:57:14,004 --> 00:57:15,464
She's been a real witch.

We almost just died.

00:57:29,003 --> 00:57:31,546
I got a tattoo.

Yeah? She's really
good though.

1145
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,841
You can do way better
than her.

Hold up just a minute,
that's not the straight scoop.

1151
00:58:18,219 --> 00:58:20,170
This girl's so uptight,
she's tied in a loop.

1152
00:58:20,204 --> 00:58:25,867

We got ourselves
a battle of the babysitters.

Let's rewind this movie
an hour or two.

1154
00:58:33,492 --> 00:58:35,276
The kid snuck out,
I didn't have a clue.

1155
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,671
Yeah, that's true.

1156
00:58:40,466 --> 00:58:43,568
Okay, I admit it,
I don't follow rules.

1157
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:46,204
I'm not good with kids,
I'm not good at school.

1158
00:58:46,238 --> 00:58:48,406
It wasn't my plan
to steal a car,

1159
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:51,200
or end up in jail
or take it this far.

1160
00:58:51,235 --> 00:58:53,578
It's true I lied,
but nobody's died.

1161
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,781
And these kids are having
an incredible ride.

1162
00:58:55,783 --> 00:58:58,358
You think you know it all,
but you don't know me.

1163
00:58:58,392 --> 00:59:00,452
See, I'm more than just
Miss Spelling Bee.

1164
00:59:00,486 --> 00:59:02,229
You want to be
a real artist,

1165
00:59:02,263 --> 00:59:03,980
take pictures, get gritty,

1166
00:59:04,015 --> 00:59:06,258
on your first night out
in the big, bad city.

1167
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:09,394
- You're a cool girl, Jenny,
but I'm pretty cool, too.
- Go, Lola, go, Lola.

1168
00:59:09,428 --> 00:59:12,789
In fact, I'm just as great
a babysitter as you.

1169
00:59:12,823 --> 00:59:14,499
Ha!

1170
00:59:25,244 --> 00:59:27,920
She's right, I'm smart,
and I do follow rules.

1171
00:59:27,955 --> 00:59:30,774
I work real hard,
and I care about school.

1172
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:32,800
There's a time for fun,
to let go and climb trees,

1173
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:35,028
but I am a real artist;
everybody say cheese.

That's right.

They ain't no quitters.

TINY: Move! Come on.

SCALPER: Out of the way.

1195
01:00:31,185 --> 01:00:32,619
Those are our kids.
Can we just...

1196
01:00:35,973 --> 01:00:38,675
Stop in your tracks.

1197
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,710
'Cause you ain't goin' nowhere
till we get the facts!

1198
01:00:42,988 --> 01:00:44,089
Facts?

1199
01:00:46,675 --> 01:00:48,443
Jenny, you were great!

1200
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:52,238
- That was amazing.
- I can't believe
I just did that.

1201
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,940
See what happens
when you just let go?

1202
01:00:53,974 --> 01:00:54,941
The art just
starts to flow.

1203
01:00:54,975 --> 01:00:56,918
Well, speaking of flow,

1204
01:00:56,952 --> 01:00:59,745
we better get going before
these guys come out, all right?

1205
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,006
Jenny, you were
way cool.

1206
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,584
TREY: Not cool.
You were radical!

1207
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,736
She didn't end
world hunger, people.

1208
01:01:08,622 --> 01:01:10,415
Yeah, I just
came on shift,

1209
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:11,357
but let me check, okay?

1210
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:13,125
Yeah, all right.

1211
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:17,013
George, got any kids
locked up in the back,
or babysitters?

1212
01:01:17,047 --> 01:01:19,524
None yet.

1213
01:01:19,558 --> 01:01:21,284
We don't usually
lock up the children

1214
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:23,837
- until after midnight.
- ( both laughing )

1215
01:01:27,099 --> 01:01:28,133
I'm sorry.

1216
01:01:31,645 --> 01:01:32,763
This was mama's
one night out.

1217
01:01:32,797 --> 01:01:34,139
Thanks, fellas.

1218
01:01:38,552 --> 01:01:41,479
- LOLA: That was really great.
I am so proud of you.
- JENNY: Thanks.

1219
01:01:47,127 --> 01:01:49,821
Hey, you should
talk to Emily.
She seems pretty down.

1220
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:56,561
Hey, um, I just wanted
to apologize about earlier

1221
01:01:56,595 --> 01:01:57,846
back at the police station.

1222
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,155
Whatever.

1223
01:01:59,189 --> 01:02:01,391
Just forget it.

1224
01:02:01,425 --> 01:02:03,542
No, I won't forget it.

1225
01:02:03,577 --> 01:02:05,811
It's been an awful night,

1226
01:02:05,846 --> 01:02:07,280
but it's no excuse
to hurt your feelings.

1227
01:02:07,315 --> 01:02:09,666
You're not a child.

1228
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,818
You're an amazing,
smart, cool girl.

1229
01:02:11,852 --> 01:02:14,612
No, I'm just a dork.

1230
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:16,697
Nobody even knows
I exist.

1231
01:02:16,732 --> 01:02:19,192
I'm just
an invisible dork.

1232
01:02:19,226 --> 01:02:21,928
You're not invisible.
You're beautiful.

1233
01:02:21,963 --> 01:02:25,640
And you don't need
green hair or tattoos
to be noticed.

1234
01:02:25,674 --> 01:02:28,176
Just be your
awesome self.

1235
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:29,694
I promise you,
it's enough.

1236
01:02:33,699 --> 01:02:36,910
If he doesn't
see that, then...

1237
01:02:36,944 --> 01:02:38,077
that's his loss.

1238
01:02:40,431 --> 01:02:43,041
Besides...

1239
01:02:46,036 --> 01:02:47,954
boys are dorks.

1240
01:02:47,988 --> 01:02:49,881
They are dorks.

1241
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:52,967
Thanks, Jenny.

1242
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:59,374
Um, Jenny.

1243
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:02,694
I have something I should
probably tell you.

1244
01:03:02,728 --> 01:03:06,297
Maybe she meant
the North Park station.

1245
01:03:06,331 --> 01:03:07,899
- It's not that far--
- No, no, no.

1246
01:03:07,933 --> 01:03:09,634
Absolutely not.

1247
01:03:09,668 --> 01:03:11,644
Barry, I am tired,
I'm cold.

1248
01:03:11,678 --> 01:03:14,072
My feet are numb.

1249
01:03:17,868 --> 01:03:20,186
Barry, why didn't
you tell me

1250
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,604
that I was wearing
two different shoes?

1251
01:03:21,638 --> 01:03:23,823
I thought it was
a fashion choice.

1252
01:03:23,857 --> 01:03:26,885
You called
your parents?!

1253
01:03:26,919 --> 01:03:29,429
- I'm sorry.
- She called the parents.

1254
01:03:29,463 --> 01:03:30,388
That's it, it's over.

1255
01:03:30,423 --> 01:03:31,548
BARRY: Taxi.

1256
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:34,884
That girl looks
like Emily.

1257
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:41,440
She's got green hair.
You're exhausted.

1258
01:03:41,475 --> 01:03:44,644
Emily, you have to
call them back and
tell them it was a prank.

1259
01:03:44,678 --> 01:03:45,353
Here, use mine.

1260
01:03:51,235 --> 01:03:53,728
- Come on.
- ( line ringing )

1261
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:56,939
We'd have gotten back
faster if we walked.

1262
01:03:56,974 --> 01:03:58,566
Of course, we can't walk
because of my shoes.

1263
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,851
Finally.
Maybe it's Jenny.

1264
01:04:00,886 --> 01:04:03,804
( phone buzzing )

1265
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,731
L. Perez.
I don't know any L. Perez.

1266
01:04:05,765 --> 01:04:08,542
I'm not answering.
Stop.

1267
01:04:08,577 --> 01:04:11,279
<i>Hi, you've reached...</i>

1268
01:04:11,313 --> 01:04:13,906
- Didn't answer.
- Great. There goes that plan.

1269
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,083
Can't you just
delete the message?

1270
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:17,260
How? I don't
know the code.

1271
01:04:19,913 --> 01:04:21,539
Mom and Dad are at
the planetarium.

1272
01:04:21,573 --> 01:04:23,032
It's not that
far from here.

1273
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,058
Yeah, let's just
sneak into the party,

1274
01:04:24,092 --> 01:04:26,602
find your mom's phone and delete
the message ourselves.

1275
01:04:26,637 --> 01:04:28,713
Ooh, sure, no problem,
MacGyver.

1276
01:04:28,747 --> 01:04:30,590
I'll just take out
the security guards

1277
01:04:30,624 --> 01:04:32,099
with my Taser gun,
and then,

1278
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:33,926
Katy here can shimmy in
through the air ducts.

1279
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,870
I'm not dressed
to shimmy.

1280
01:04:35,904 --> 01:04:37,922
Are you always
this negative?

1281
01:04:37,956 --> 01:04:40,750
You can't even consider
an idea that's a little
bit outside the box?

1282
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:42,894
Outside of the box?
You just got outside of jail.

1283
01:04:42,928 --> 01:04:45,021
Now you wanna
crash a gala?

1284
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,355
Even if we could make it,
there's no chance

1285
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:47,924
we'd get
the money in time.

1286
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:51,494
Katy's three-star
party survival kit.

1287
01:04:51,528 --> 01:04:53,296
Mommy keeps
a hundred-dollar bill

1288
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:55,223
- in her fancy coat pocket.
- Yes, Katy!

1289
01:04:55,257 --> 01:04:56,675
No, it's too dangerous.

1290
01:04:56,709 --> 01:04:58,635
Come on, Jenny.

1291
01:04:58,669 --> 01:05:01,179
There are moments in life
where you just have to
take a risk

1292
01:05:01,213 --> 01:05:03,690
and go for it.

1293
01:05:03,724 --> 01:05:05,475
This is one of
those moments.

1294
01:05:37,282 --> 01:05:39,750
What brings
you kids here?

1295
01:05:39,785 --> 01:05:41,519
We're going to steal
money from my mommy's...

1296
01:05:41,553 --> 01:05:43,279
Kids. They are so cute.

1297
01:05:43,313 --> 01:05:46,123
We're babysitters just taking
a little evening field trip

1298
01:05:46,158 --> 01:05:48,209
to the planetarium.

1299
01:05:48,243 --> 01:05:50,811
Field trip?
At this hour?

1300
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:51,937
Dude, Jupiter's
at opposition.

1301
01:05:51,972 --> 01:05:54,557
Best time to observe it.

1302
01:05:54,592 --> 01:05:56,234
You're right.
You really know your stuff.

1303
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:01,197
My mom's
a scientist.

1304
01:06:08,438 --> 01:06:09,414
Go, go.

1305
01:06:12,484 --> 01:06:13,476
Finally.

1306
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:14,961
My people.

1307
01:06:17,255 --> 01:06:19,015
Lucky I wore diamonds.

1308
01:06:19,049 --> 01:06:21,417
No, Katy, you didn't.

1309
01:06:21,451 --> 01:06:23,936
Really?

1310
01:06:23,971 --> 01:06:26,389
It's Friday night.
What did you expect
me to wear, pearls?

1311
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,893
- Hey, it's Mom.
- Where?

1312
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:35,665
Oh, no, this is
a nightmare.

1313
01:06:35,699 --> 01:06:38,443
No, it's actually
a really good picture.
It's intense.

1314
01:06:38,477 --> 01:06:40,053
Not the picture.

1315
01:06:40,087 --> 01:06:42,121
If she sees me, I'll never
get that recommendation letter.

1316
01:06:42,156 --> 01:06:45,458
How did you forget
the Andersons were
gonna be here tonight?

1317
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,777
I didn't forget.
I have it right
here on this note.

1318
01:06:47,811 --> 01:06:50,521
Where's the note?

1319
01:06:50,555 --> 01:06:54,725
National Science Foundation
Celestial Ball.

1320
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,335
This must be
our lucky night.

1321
01:06:59,131 --> 01:07:00,590
It sure is.

1322
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,889
Ah, do you smell that?

1323
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:08,639
Fresh oregano
and a hint of red pepper.

1324
01:07:10,809 --> 01:07:12,602
Jenny, coat room's
over there.

1325
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,360
Everyone duck and cover.
Let's go.

1326
01:07:20,394 --> 01:07:21,444
Go!

1327
01:07:46,236 --> 01:07:47,637
And these are
my people.

1328
01:07:52,642 --> 01:07:55,336
Oh! I can't serve this.

1329
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:56,837
It's original
creation.

1330
01:07:56,872 --> 01:07:59,365
<i>C'est magnifique.</i>

1331
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,133
It's dog poop.

1332
01:08:01,168 --> 01:08:04,278
You are dog poop.

1333
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:08,241
I quit!

1334
01:08:10,919 --> 01:08:13,754
( speaking French )

1335
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:16,541
What's taking so long?
The guests are waiting
for dessert.

1336
01:08:16,575 --> 01:08:18,793
( stammering )

1337
01:08:22,873 --> 01:08:26,075
Okay, I'll distract
the coat check person,
Jenny, you find the coat.

1338
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:27,860
Great, good. Okay.

1339
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,553
Uh, everyone,
stay in here.

1340
01:08:29,587 --> 01:08:30,805
Trey, Emily,
keep an eye on the... kids.

1341
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:32,306
Where's Bobby?

1342
01:08:37,312 --> 01:08:39,046
I need sea salt
and Mexican chocolate.

1343
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,197
Freshly grated,
of course.

1344
01:08:40,232 --> 01:08:42,174
Who are you?

1345
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:44,210
Assistant pastry chef,
dude... sir.

1346
01:08:44,244 --> 01:08:47,338
Hurry. Go!

1347
01:08:47,372 --> 01:08:48,447
Sea salt!

1348
01:08:50,592 --> 01:08:52,176
Oh, my gosh,
what's he doing?

1349
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:53,878
It's fine; let the kid
do his thing.

1350
01:08:53,912 --> 01:08:55,237
We gotta buy some time.

1351
01:08:55,272 --> 01:08:57,674
- I wanna go
to the party, too.
- Absolutely not, Katy.

1352
01:08:57,708 --> 01:09:02,670
Do you remember what my mommy's
fancy coat looks like?

1353
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:04,964
You're good.
Let's go.

1354
01:09:06,808 --> 01:09:08,092
Sea salt!

1355
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:14,031
Thank you.

1356
01:09:14,065 --> 01:09:18,210
I can't believe you thought
our kids were in the city jail.

1357
01:09:18,244 --> 01:09:21,848
Let's just get our coats
and go home.

1358
01:09:21,882 --> 01:09:23,090
- It's Mommy.
- Katy.

1359
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:24,709
It's your kids, too.

1360
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,519
It's Jenny.

1361
01:09:26,553 --> 01:09:28,378
Where?

1362
01:09:28,413 --> 01:09:30,748
No, she's not
here, Barry.

1363
01:09:30,782 --> 01:09:32,000
I mean, Jenny is
babysitting.

1364
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:35,144
She's the most responsible
babysitter in the world.

1365
01:09:35,178 --> 01:09:37,296
If anything was wrong,
she would've called us.

1366
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:39,624
Jenny.
There it is.

1367
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:42,835
- Oh, no!
- She's coming!

1368
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:53,513
BARRY: I still
wanna go home.

1369
01:09:53,547 --> 01:09:56,907
Fine. Go home.

1370
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:58,400
I'm going
to get dessert.

1371
01:09:58,435 --> 01:09:59,477
You do that.

1372
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,747
I have to eat
dessert now.

1373
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:05,491
Great. There goes
our cash.

1374
01:10:05,525 --> 01:10:06,692
Why don't we just
go get it?

1375
01:10:06,726 --> 01:10:08,653
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the Coopers
will recognize me.

1376
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:14,075
But...

1377
01:10:15,585 --> 01:10:18,954
But what?

1378
01:10:18,989 --> 01:10:21,215
Uh, I never wear heels.

1379
01:10:21,249 --> 01:10:23,659
It's easy, you just
stand on your toes.

1380
01:10:23,693 --> 01:10:25,670
Okay.

1381
01:10:25,704 --> 01:10:27,513
How do I look?

1382
01:10:27,547 --> 01:10:29,382
Almost. Not quite.
Come here.

1383
01:10:35,705 --> 01:10:38,065
Okay.

1384
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,492
Here we go.

1385
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:43,362
No, no, there's no way
I'm doing this.

1386
01:10:43,396 --> 01:10:45,389
- This is never gonna--
- Come on, Lola.

1387
01:10:45,423 --> 01:10:49,552
There are moments in life
when you just have to take
a risk and go for it.

1388
01:10:49,586 --> 01:10:52,113
This is one of
those moments.

1389
01:10:56,234 --> 01:10:57,410
No.

1390
01:10:59,196 --> 01:11:00,538
Absolutely not.

1391
01:11:03,542 --> 01:11:05,183
Even worse.

1392
01:11:05,218 --> 01:11:07,870
- What is this?
- Celery leaf.

1393
01:11:07,904 --> 01:11:10,698
I don't ever wanna
see this again.

1394
01:11:10,732 --> 01:11:13,843
Will somebody bring me
something innovative?

1395
01:11:15,387 --> 01:11:16,429
Innovative!

1396
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:30,985
That's it!

1397
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:39,476
Crushed seaweed.
It's so innovative.

1398
01:11:39,511 --> 01:11:42,262
I hear he's from
the Culinary Institute.
Some sort of prodigy.

1399
01:11:42,297 --> 01:11:44,874
It's all about
the perfect ingredient.

1400
01:11:44,908 --> 01:11:46,417
It sure is, kid.

1401
01:11:49,228 --> 01:11:51,697
Can I help you,
gentlemen?

1402
01:11:51,731 --> 01:11:53,624
Yeah, you see some kids
come in here?

1403
01:11:53,658 --> 01:11:55,584
Who wants to know?

1404
01:11:55,618 --> 01:11:57,828
Uh...

1405
01:11:57,863 --> 01:11:59,404
We're their uncles.

1406
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:02,291
Their parents sent us
to pick them up.

1407
01:12:02,325 --> 01:12:04,060
I think you better
wait here.

1408
01:12:09,307 --> 01:12:11,383
Hey!

1409
01:12:11,417 --> 01:12:13,177
Yeah, this is Eugene
in the lobby.

1410
01:12:13,211 --> 01:12:16,422
I got two suspicious subjects
heading into Sky Pavilion.

1411
01:12:16,456 --> 01:12:18,407
I may need back-up.

1412
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,793
( British accent )
Hello, darling. Lovely party.

1413
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:42,940
Where is she?

1414
01:12:42,974 --> 01:12:44,016
Look at all the dresses.

1415
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:50,147
( British accent )
Hello, all.
Fabulous gala.

1416
01:12:50,182 --> 01:12:54,126
Oh, what about
that piano player?

1417
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:55,945
Wasn't that "Fur Elise"
he was playing earlier?

1418
01:12:55,979 --> 01:12:58,739
I don't know.

1419
01:12:58,773 --> 01:13:00,741
All I know is
this mousse is incredible.

1420
01:13:04,555 --> 01:13:06,213
Oh, there's Lola.

1421
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:07,748
Tastes good.

1422
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:12,711
Let me see.

1423
01:13:14,631 --> 01:13:16,465
- KATY: She looks so pretty.
- JENNY: Thanks to you.

1424
01:13:21,121 --> 01:13:23,422
Oh, I love your earrings.

1425
01:13:23,457 --> 01:13:25,249
My husband gave me a pair
just like that.

1426
01:13:25,283 --> 01:13:28,101
He told me they were
one of a kind.

1427
01:13:28,136 --> 01:13:30,287
That's what
I was told.

1428
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:32,056
These were a gift
from my boyfriend.

1429
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:33,949
He's a police officer,
a rookie.

1430
01:13:33,984 --> 01:13:35,300
So handsome.

1431
01:13:35,335 --> 01:13:37,077
How nice.

1432
01:13:37,111 --> 01:13:39,972
Oh, I adore your coat.

1433
01:13:40,007 --> 01:13:42,366
Is this real wool?

1434
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,160
No, it's cashmere.
That's what you told me.

1435
01:13:45,195 --> 01:13:46,703
Clumsy me.
I'll get it.

1436
01:13:46,738 --> 01:13:48,497
That's what it says
on the tag.

1437
01:13:48,531 --> 01:13:50,516
Okay, fine, so they're not
one of a kind.

1438
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:51,959
- You don't have to
lie about it.
- I didn't.

1439
01:13:51,993 --> 01:13:54,512
I swear, honey.

1440
01:13:54,546 --> 01:13:56,205
You know what, it's fine,
I don't care.

1441
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:59,475
Let's just have fun.
I wanna enjoy what's
left of the evening.

1442
01:13:59,509 --> 01:14:00,993
This dessert,
it's a lot of fun.

1443
01:14:01,027 --> 01:14:02,712
Well, if you'll
excuse me.

1444
01:14:02,746 --> 01:14:04,722
Nature calls.
Toodles.

1445
01:14:11,838 --> 01:14:13,022
- Give me the camera.
- This is not mine.

1446
01:14:21,072 --> 01:14:23,766
You brought the ferret!

1447
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,477
I ain't leavin'
100 grand in the car.

1448
01:14:26,511 --> 01:14:27,703
We gotta stop him
before he gets away.

1449
01:14:31,007 --> 01:14:32,767
- Oh, sorry.
- Nice party.

1450
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,710
( people screaming )

1451
01:14:34,745 --> 01:14:36,629
TINY: Come here, buddy.
Come on.

1452
01:14:41,026 --> 01:14:43,769
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1453
01:14:43,804 --> 01:14:45,896
Oh, come here.

1454
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:47,372
You little ferret,
come here.

1455
01:14:47,406 --> 01:14:49,100
Come here.
Come to Tiny.

1456
01:14:49,134 --> 01:14:51,060
Come to Tiny.

1457
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:05,491
( notes playing
discordantly )

1458
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:14,291
Oh, my God!

1459
01:15:17,495 --> 01:15:20,306
- There he goes. Yay!
- He's on my foot.

1460
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,632
He's on my foot,
he's on my foot.

1461
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:22,466
He's on my foot.

1462
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,022
I hope we're not
missing anything.

1463
01:15:37,056 --> 01:15:39,892
What?

1464
01:15:39,926 --> 01:15:41,735
Nothing.
Crouton?

1465
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:50,919
So... why did you want
to do that to your hair?

1466
01:15:50,954 --> 01:15:53,063
I don't know.

1467
01:15:53,098 --> 01:15:54,957
Because.

1468
01:15:54,991 --> 01:15:57,609
I'm... boring.

1469
01:15:57,644 --> 01:15:58,727
You're not boring.

1470
01:15:58,761 --> 01:16:00,079
Yes, I am.

1471
01:16:00,113 --> 01:16:03,106
No, you're not.

1472
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:04,991
Tell you the truth,
I think you're pretty cool.

1473
01:16:05,026 --> 01:16:06,877
You do?

1474
01:16:06,911 --> 01:16:08,954
Yeah.

1475
01:16:08,988 --> 01:16:10,706
Your music's
what's boring.

1476
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:13,309
- It is not.
- Yeah, it is.

1477
01:16:13,343 --> 01:16:14,743
Yours is boring.

1478
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:17,287
Come on, guys.
Time to go.

1479
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:18,222
- Time to go.
- We got the money.
Come on.

1480
01:16:18,256 --> 01:16:20,816
A.J., let's go,
come on.

1481
01:16:20,851 --> 01:16:22,818
I'm gonna get you
when we get out.

1482
01:16:22,852 --> 01:16:25,087
If you could drive
more than five
miles an hour...

1483
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:27,147
You just had to let
the ferret get away.

1484
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:29,508
- Hey, isn't that...
- ( arguing continues )

1485
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:30,534
It's a long story.
No time. Come on.

1486
01:16:37,809 --> 01:16:40,886
Uh-huh. A big, fat man
named Tiny,

1487
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,863
a tall, skinny guy
in a hood,

1488
01:16:42,897 --> 01:16:44,823
and a rare
sapphire ferret.

1489
01:16:44,857 --> 01:16:46,208
MAN:<i>  Yeah, can you</i>
<i>believe that?</i>

1490
01:16:46,242 --> 01:16:47,051
Yeah, actually,
I do believe you.

1491
01:16:48,695 --> 01:16:51,571
( kids laughing )

1492
01:16:51,606 --> 01:16:53,608
LOLA: We did it!
I can't believe it.

1493
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:57,410
And with an extra 20 bucks
to get to the tow yard.

1494
01:16:57,445 --> 01:16:59,697
How did you get
an extra 20?

1495
01:16:59,731 --> 01:17:01,298
Smart babysitters
check both pockets.

1496
01:17:01,332 --> 01:17:04,718
Nice going.
You know, we actually
make a pretty good team.

1497
01:17:04,752 --> 01:17:05,444
- We do, don't we?
- Wait.

1498
01:17:09,482 --> 01:17:11,542
You know, I really
underestimated you, Jen.

1499
01:17:11,576 --> 01:17:13,711
Underneath all this
stifled perfection,

1500
01:17:13,745 --> 01:17:16,205
- there's a really
cool chick.
- Thanks, Lola.

1501
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:18,723
Yeah, I can totally see
why that guy asked you
to the concert.

1502
01:17:18,758 --> 01:17:20,258
It makes so much
sense now.

1503
01:17:20,293 --> 01:17:22,870
What... guy?

1504
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:26,665
Uh, uh, I think
his name was Zeke.

1505
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:29,293
- Zac.
- Yeah, uh...
Sounds about right.

1506
01:17:29,327 --> 01:17:30,920
Zac Chase invited me
to a concert?

1507
01:17:30,954 --> 01:17:33,488
How could you
not tell me?

1508
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:35,824
- I forgot.
- You forgot.

1509
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:37,784
That was only the single
most important phone call

1510
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,812
of my life.
What did you say?

1511
01:17:39,846 --> 01:17:43,232
Uh, not much.

1512
01:17:43,266 --> 01:17:46,518
Uh, I might've implied
that you possibly

1513
01:17:46,552 --> 01:17:48,437
weren't interested in him.

1514
01:17:48,471 --> 01:17:50,947
What?

1515
01:17:50,982 --> 01:17:52,474
Why would you
do that?

1516
01:17:52,509 --> 01:17:55,477
I was distracted.

1517
01:17:55,511 --> 01:17:57,671
You saw how cute
Officer James is.

1518
01:17:57,705 --> 01:17:59,414
I'm sorry, Jenny,
I didn't mean to...

1519
01:17:59,449 --> 01:18:01,442
That's great.
That's great because

1520
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:03,685
now he's there with
Dominique Cassidy.

1521
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,487
That should've been me
at that concert.

1522
01:18:05,521 --> 01:18:07,389
Maybe it's not
too late.

1523
01:18:07,423 --> 01:18:08,957
Of course it's too late.

1524
01:18:08,992 --> 01:18:11,627
That show is almost over,
and now, we have to get the car

1525
01:18:11,661 --> 01:18:12,887
and get back home.

1526
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:14,771
Just forget it.

1527
01:18:14,805 --> 01:18:16,656
No, I won't.
Taxi!

1528
01:18:16,691 --> 01:18:19,593
- Taxi!
- What are you doing?

1529
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:21,687
The right thing.
You guys, come on, let's go.

1530
01:18:21,721 --> 01:18:23,547
Come on, there's still
time if we hurry.

1531
01:18:23,581 --> 01:18:27,517
You don't have to worry about
those guys anymore, buddy.

1532
01:18:27,552 --> 01:18:30,053
- I'm gonna get you home.
- ( chittering )

1533
01:18:30,088 --> 01:18:33,240
You guys won't be kidnapping
any more exotic animals
where you're going.

1534
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:36,426
Hey, Hal, I have
a message from
the security company.

1535
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:38,245
They said the alarm
went off at the house earlier,

1536
01:18:38,279 --> 01:18:41,106
- and the babysitter's
not answering.
- Try the home phone.

1537
01:18:41,141 --> 01:18:45,377
( phone ringing )

1538
01:18:49,048 --> 01:18:52,885
( ringing continues )

1539
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:03,787
Wait, wait.

1540
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,730
We don't even
have tickets.

1541
01:19:05,765 --> 01:19:07,725
Just let me
handle this, okay?

1542
01:19:07,759 --> 01:19:10,211
Just for once,
trust me.

1543
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:11,645

No, but what's it
gonna take to get
all of us in?

You know you can't
take your camera in, right?

1546
01:19:21,722 --> 01:19:23,373
Give it to me,
and I'll let you all in.

1547
01:19:27,354 --> 01:19:29,413
Right. Right, yeah.

1548

Of course. Yeah.

1549

the memory card.

01:19:33,042 --> 01:19:35,302
No, no. Stop.

1551

You can't do that.
That means too much
to you, Lola.

1552
01:19:38,598 --> 01:19:41,558
Yes, I can.

1553
01:19:48,766 --> 01:19:50,692
Let's go, guys.

your guy, Jen.

go in like this.

rapped onstage,

No, it wasn't me.

Wait, don't move!

Dominique? No, she
left early with her boyfriend.

She has a boyfriend?

1622
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:50,405
KIDS: Jenny. Jenny!

1623
01:22:50,439 --> 01:22:52,040
- Jenny.
- Jenny!

1624
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:56,169
Jenny, I got a missed call
from the Andersons,

1625
01:22:56,203 --> 01:22:58,430
but I thought we should
listen to the message together.

1626
01:22:58,464 --> 01:22:59,256
All right. Put it
on speaker.

1627
01:23:03,336 --> 01:23:06,029
Hi, guys.
This is Zac.

1628
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:08,106
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
I'm sort of babysitting.

1629
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:10,050
Wow. Their parents must
really trust you

1630
01:23:10,084 --> 01:23:11,668
to take their kids
into the city.

1631
01:23:11,702 --> 01:23:14,404
Okay, guys,
here it is.

1632
01:23:14,438 --> 01:23:15,913
<i>Lola, the security company</i>
<i>called.</i>

1633
01:23:15,948 --> 01:23:17,783
<i>The alarm went off earlier,</i>

1634
01:23:17,817 --> 01:23:19,109
<i>no one's answering</i>
<i>at the house,</i>

1635
01:23:19,143 --> 01:23:20,268
<i>and we just heard from</i>
<i>the Coopers</i>

1636
01:23:20,303 --> 01:23:22,979
<i>who are looking for</i>
<i>their kids in the city jail.</i>

1637
01:23:23,014 --> 01:23:24,356
<i>- We're on our way home.</i>
- I knew it.

1638
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:26,834
I knew this would happen.
I knew we would've
been home by now

1639
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:29,160
if I hadn't broken
the most important
rule of all.

1640
01:23:29,195 --> 01:23:30,037
You never put a boy
before kids.

1641
01:23:33,633 --> 01:23:36,292
No, it's my fault.
I talked you into it.

1642
01:23:36,327 --> 01:23:38,128
I practically forced you.

1643
01:23:38,163 --> 01:23:39,655
I never should've
taken this job.

1644
01:23:39,689 --> 01:23:41,639
I thought babysitting
was the easiest job
in the world,

1645
01:23:41,674 --> 01:23:43,876
but it's not.

1646
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:45,201
Jenny, I'll take
full responsibility.

1647
01:23:45,236 --> 01:23:47,137
I'll tell the truth.

1648
01:23:47,171 --> 01:23:49,189
You didn't recommend me,
we're not friends.

1649
01:23:49,223 --> 01:23:52,058
I lied about everything.

1650
01:23:52,093 --> 01:23:54,803
Let's just turn
ourselves in.

1651
01:23:54,837 --> 01:23:57,573
For once, I agree with you.

1652
01:23:57,607 --> 01:23:59,424
- Now just wait
one minute.
- Yeah.

1653
01:23:59,459 --> 01:24:03,236
We've spent the whole night
listening to you two
argue and whine.

1654
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:05,997
But you two aren't
the only ones with
something to lose.

1655
01:24:06,031 --> 01:24:08,591
- We're not?
- Hello!

1656
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:10,243
I snuck out
to a concert.

1657
01:24:10,278 --> 01:24:12,412
I skated off
in the city by myself.

1658
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:14,056
I used the stove.
Started a fire.

1659
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:16,066
Impersonated a chef.

1660
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:19,110
I took my mommy's
favorite diamond earrings.

1661
01:24:19,144 --> 01:24:20,904
I dyed my hair green,
got a tattoo,

1662
01:24:20,938 --> 01:24:23,373
and told my parents
we were in jail.

1663
01:24:23,407 --> 01:24:26,910
- I'm sorry, guys.
- Yeah, me, too.

1664
01:24:26,944 --> 01:24:28,445
There's no way
we'll make it.

1665

it'll take to get
to the tow yard?

Wait. We're here.
Hey, lady.

1675
01:24:59,911 --> 01:25:02,037
We're closed.
Come back tomorrow.

1676
01:25:02,071 --> 01:25:04,131

Just give us the car.

01:27:39,237 --> 01:27:42,580
Well, we just
wanted to say...

1715
01:27:42,614 --> 01:27:44,675
We think you're both
awesome babysitters.

1716
01:27:44,709 --> 01:27:48,194
Yeah. This has been
the coolest night of our lives.

1717
01:27:48,228 --> 01:27:49,963
- For sure.
- Absolutely.

1718
01:27:49,997 --> 01:27:52,140
I met my hero.

1719
01:27:52,174 --> 01:27:54,184
I finally found
my perfect ingredient.

1720
01:27:54,218 --> 01:27:57,011
I went to my first gala.

1721
01:27:57,045 --> 01:27:59,155
I missed the concert,
but this has been

1722
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:00,766
the best night
of my life.

1723
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,009
Yeah. Ours, too.

1724
01:28:03,043 --> 01:28:04,777
Yeah.

1725
01:28:04,812 --> 01:28:05,520
( giggles )

1726
01:28:10,642 --> 01:28:13,369
Okay, you freaks, everybody
get out of here already.

1727
01:28:13,403 --> 01:28:14,321
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1728
01:28:17,174 --> 01:28:19,275
- JENNY: Buckled up?
- KIDS: Yeah.

1729
01:28:19,309 --> 01:28:20,243
Let's get going.

1730
01:28:25,591 --> 01:28:26,791
HELEN: The house isn't on fire.
So far, so good.

1731
01:28:36,102 --> 01:28:37,819
Now don't tell anyone,
Lady Marmalade.

1732
01:28:37,853 --> 01:28:39,437
( barks )

1733
01:28:39,471 --> 01:28:40,638
( Helen and Hal
speaking indistinctly )

1734
01:28:42,967 --> 01:28:45,076
- Hi!
- Hi.

1735
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:46,627
You guys are home
so soon.

1736
01:28:46,662 --> 01:28:48,087
Is everything okay?

1737
01:28:48,121 --> 01:28:49,939
Couldn't be better,
Helen.

1738
01:28:49,973 --> 01:28:53,551
- Your children
are angels.
- ( relieved sigh )

1739
01:28:53,585 --> 01:28:56,279
Jenny, thank you again
so much for everything.

1740
01:28:56,313 --> 01:28:57,914
We really hope
your night of babysitting

1741
01:28:57,948 --> 01:28:59,775
wasn't as much trouble
as mine.

1742
01:28:59,809 --> 01:29:01,910
( laughs )
No. No trouble at all.

1743
01:29:06,808 --> 01:29:08,375
( siren wailing )

1744
01:29:14,707 --> 01:29:17,275
No!

1745
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,411
Officer, I don't think
I was speeding,

1746
01:29:19,445 --> 01:29:21,071
but if I was,
there's a very
good reason.

1747
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:22,898
I've had a really...

1748
01:29:22,932 --> 01:29:25,225
Driving without a license
is illegal.

1749
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:29,120
Okay, seriously,
you really need
to take a night off.

1750
01:29:29,154 --> 01:29:30,956
That's a great idea.

1751
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:32,807
How about Saturday?

1752
01:29:32,841 --> 01:29:35,326
Um...

1753
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,570
Yeah, yeah,
Saturday works.

1754
01:29:53,913 --> 01:29:56,881
Zac. What are you
doing here?

1755
01:29:56,916 --> 01:29:58,617
Um, returning
Emily's headphones.

1756
01:29:58,651 --> 01:30:00,977
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe
she would've forgotten those.

1757
01:30:01,011 --> 01:30:04,089
She technically didn't.

1758
01:30:04,123 --> 01:30:04,955
I asked her if I could
keep them.

1759
01:30:04,990 --> 01:30:07,392
You did?

1760
01:30:07,426 --> 01:30:09,594
- Yeah.
- Why?

1761
01:30:09,628 --> 01:30:12,096
Um, so I could return them.

1762
01:30:12,130 --> 01:30:14,165
Right.

1763
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,926
- And see you.
- EMILY: Ask her out.

1764
01:30:16,961 --> 01:30:18,886
Ask<i>  him</i>  out!

1765
01:30:18,921 --> 01:30:20,488
( both giggling )

1766
01:30:22,591 --> 01:30:24,651
Do you...

1767
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:27,220
- Wanna go out with me?
- With me?

1768
01:30:27,254 --> 01:30:28,738
BOTH: Yes?

1769
01:30:28,772 --> 01:30:30,631
Yeah?

1770
01:30:30,666 --> 01:30:32,625
( giggling )

1771
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,463
Okay.

1772
01:30:45,497 --> 01:30:47,298
Great, Zac.
I'll see you tonight.

1773
01:30:47,332 --> 01:30:48,891
Um, you're
a little late.

1774
01:30:48,926 --> 01:30:50,735
- Oh, am I?
- Yeah.

1775
01:30:50,769 --> 01:30:52,353
Sorry. I guess I just
needed to sleep in

1776
01:30:52,388 --> 01:30:54,047
after my date
with Zac last night.

1777
01:30:54,081 --> 01:30:56,616
Aw, I'm really happy
for you guys.

1778
01:30:56,650 --> 01:30:58,677
And I want you
to know, Jenny,

1779
01:30:58,711 --> 01:31:03,106
whatever happens today,
whoever Leon picks,
I'm okay.

1780
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:07,268
Thank you, but
you were right, Lola.

1781
01:31:07,302 --> 01:31:09,270
I didn't even know
who Leon Vasquez was

1782
01:31:09,304 --> 01:31:11,331
before I read about
this internship.

1783
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:14,876
I like photography,
but no, I don't love it.

1784
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:16,670
Not like you.

1785
01:31:16,704 --> 01:31:19,556
I called earlier

1786
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:21,049
and officially withdrew
my application.

1787
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:25,945
I'm taking
the summer off.

1788
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:28,406
What about college
and early admission

1789
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,041
and your transcripts?

1790
01:31:30,075 --> 01:31:31,609
What about fun
and free time,

1791
01:31:31,643 --> 01:31:33,319
and living outside
of the box?

1792
01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:36,448
Well, uh...

1793
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:37,882
since you're such an expert
at this college stuff,

1794
01:31:37,916 --> 01:31:42,479
maybe you could help me with
my art school applications.

1795
01:31:42,513 --> 01:31:44,280
Sure. Friends help
friends, right?

1796
01:31:44,314 --> 01:31:46,099
Yeah.

1797
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:49,027
And if you ever need
a recommendation
as a babysitter,

1798
01:31:49,061 --> 01:31:51,379
feel free to use my name.

1799
01:31:51,413 --> 01:31:52,947
I think I should
probably retire.

1800
01:31:52,981 --> 01:31:55,158
Gotcha.

1801
01:31:55,192 --> 01:31:57,769
Um, hey, could you
send me the pictures
from the other night?

1802
01:31:57,803 --> 01:32:01,172
Yeah, of course.
I'll send them over
to everyone. Come here.

1803
01:32:07,396 --> 01:32:09,530
What's this?

1804
01:32:09,565 --> 01:32:12,684
Just me being
spontaneous.

1805
01:32:18,106 --> 01:32:20,074
Um, I'll see you soon.

1806
01:32:20,108 --> 01:32:21,192
Yeah, I'll see you soon.
