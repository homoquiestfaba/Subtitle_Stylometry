00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:55,114
You know the five sweetest words
in the English language? No, sir.

2
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,649
Frank luchino,
you're under arrest.

3
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,752
- We have visual confirmation.
- Okay, here we go.

4
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,500
Come on, come on!

5
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:17,736
It's crunch time.
Let's go! Come on!

6
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,639
<i>I want you upstairs,</i>
<i>downstairs, everywhere.</i>

7
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,343
<i>Let's go.</i>
<i>Come on, get a move on.</i>

8
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:37,623
<i>Okay, bird one,</i>
<i>verify subject on board.</i>

9
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:43,295
This is the FBI.
All personnel on deck.

10
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,731
<i>We have positive I.D.</i>
<i>Luchino is alone.</i>

11
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:50,569
Yes! Come to daddy, sweetheart.

12
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,772
<i>Roger, bird one.</i>
<i>Go to position two.</i>

13
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:57,342
Roger. Securing marina now.

14
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,853
Oh, n... oh, no!

15
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,934
Hey, I'm sorry
I'm a few bucks short.

16
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:26,538
Baby, didn't I tell you to bring
all my bread 'round to my crib?

17
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,942
<i>Miles! Miles, Miles, Miles.</i>

18
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:32,544
There's no reality here.

19
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,613
I just don't feel...

20
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:38,684
<i>That you're being truthful</i>
<i>with your performance.</i>

21
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:41,887
Could you explain
what didn't work?

22
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,957
It's just that...
You're not black enough.

23
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,827
<i>You need to be more</i>
<i>afro-American.</i>

24
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,862
More Harlem-esque.

25
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:54,366
Harlem-esque? <i>Miles,</i>

26
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,635
feel your roots!

27
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,605
Get down with your bad self.

28
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:03,675
I'd love to get down with
my bad self, Mr. Grunfeld,

29
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,944
but black people don't talk
like that anymore.

30
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,946
We definitely don't dress
like this!

31
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,983
I look like
"superfly goes hiking."

32
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:14,353
Never... argue
with the playwright.

33
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:17,656
<i>Once more and from the top.</i>

34
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,692
And this time...

35
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,862
Funkier!

36
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,379
Yo, baby. I'm sorry
I'm a few bucks short.

37
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:44,616
Didn't I tell you to come by
my<i> crib</i> wit' my<i> bread?</i>

38
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,419
I oughta pop you
upside the head.

39
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:51,657
That's it! That's how
it was meant to be played.

40
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:55,394
<i>Oh, Miles... This is acting.</i>

41
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:06,938
See you next week, Miles.
Take care, honey.

42
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,508
See you guys. Bye.

43
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,879
<i>¶ All my life I've been told</i>

54
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:29,454
Miles! What's going on?

55
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,857
How you doin'? All right.
How you doin'?

56
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:34,860
I'm all right.

57
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,169
Miles, how you doin', good-looking?
Baby.

58
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:47,906
Nice hat. Thanks.

59
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,874
Yo, Duane. Duane!

60
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,977
Yo-yo-yo-yo, Duane!

61
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,780
Quit shoutin'. Duane's busy.

62
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,916
I guess he is.
You must be susie.

63
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:34,019
Who the hell is susie?
My name is Ruth!

64
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,621
That's what I meant, Ruth.

65
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:40,025
Duane spriggs, get your
skinny butt out here.

66
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,027
Who the hell is susie?

67
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,496
<i>Hey, hey?</i>

68
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:47,999
Keep it down.
I'm trying to watch Oprah.

69
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,969
Martha, you look like you've been
gettin' too much beauty sleep.

70
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,939
Don't you try to
sweet-talk me, Miles pope.

71
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:56,208
If you don't stop that noise,

72
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,211
I'm gonna put you to sleep
and it won't be beautiful.

73
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:00,846
Mmm-mmm!

74
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:03,849
Duane!

75
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:15,560
Wait!

76
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:19,831
Wait a minute. She meant nothing to me.
I don't care, Duane.

77
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,935
She meant less than nothing.
I don't care! It's over.

78
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,573
<i>Excuse me, can I get by?</i>

79
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,575
If that was Ruth,

80
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:34,579
who the hell...
what happened to susie?

81
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,649
Susie walked out on me...
When you called her Kate.

82
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:40,051
<i>Remember?</i> Oh, yeah.

83
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,855
What have you got against my love life?
You always do this shit.

84
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,058
It's hard. It would take
an Einstein to keep up.

85
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,929
You ruined my afternoon. Did you see that woman?
She was gorgeous, man!

86
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,098
She was a giant,
is what she was, man.

87
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,066
You're sheep!

88
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,536
<i>You and all the guys</i>
<i>who think like you.</i>

89
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,572
You like these skinny women
with no curves.

90
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,607
<i>Me, on the other hand,</i>

91
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:06,945
I'm like rubens, like titian...

92
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:11,283
<i>Jesus, Duane,</i>
<i>what the hell is that?</i>

93
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:14,619
This is "road crew from hell."
It's a low-budget movie.

94
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,688
<i>It starts up tomorrow.</i>

95
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,758
- Your agent called.
- What's the good news?

96
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,662
- He said he had a job.
- They're all the same.

97
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:26,264
Bitch, you been
holding out on your man?

98
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:30,268
I would never dare,
'cause you'd cut my ass.

99
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,939
Missy, ass ain't a
word we likes to hear.

100
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,575
I'm gonna take you down
to the pigley wigley.

101
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:40,612
Miles, he said
it was a dramatic lead.

102
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:43,582
Dramatic... lead?

103
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,017
"Dramatic lead."
That's what I said.

104
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:51,056
What is it, Harvey, "uptown Harlem pimps on crack"?
"Nightmare on 125th street"?

105
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:54,326
No, they're shooting in Florida.
It's a cute piece.

106
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:57,662
It's "raisin" something.
Raisin? Um...

107
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,632
you're not talking about
"raisin in the sun" are you?

108
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:03,134
Yeah. That sounds about right.

109
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,670
Harvey, are you kidding?

110
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,106
That's Lorraine hansbury.

111
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,742
It's the seminal black play.

112
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:13,078
I can't believe it. Harvey, I love you.
You're a Saint.

113
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,314
You're a good kid.
You're going to the top.

114
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:19,651
Here's your plane ticket.
Thanks, man.

115
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:22,654
Oh, did you do anything
about the audition?

116
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,623
What audition?

117
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,392
My audition for "othello"!

118
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,661
Oh, I did speak to them.

119
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:32,797
They're not sure your
singing voice is strong enough.

120
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,101
It's not a musical.
It's a play by Shakespeare.

121
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,103
It's on at the lyceum.

122
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,271
All right, I'm on it.

123
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,374
You... go to Florida.
Have a good time.

124
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,376
Work on your tan.

125
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:48,013
Ha, ha, ha. Very funny.

126
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:50,749
Cute kid.

127
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,652
Harvey? Harvey!
You son-of-a-bitch!

128
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,655
This is a commercial
for breakfast cereal.

129
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,090
You said it was,
"a raisin in the sun."

130
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:03,361
No, you said it was, "a raisin in the
sun." I said, "raisin" something.

131
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:06,097
I'm an actor,
not a piece of fruit!

132
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,366
At least you're working!

133
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,669
Thanks for nothing, Harvey.

134
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,405
<i>Places, everybody.</i>
<i>Five-minute warning.</i>

135
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:17,776

137
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,748
Hello, sir.

138
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,091
Pope, p-o-p-e.
I have a reservation.

139
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,393
P-o-p-e.

140
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,762
Miles pope. Here it is.

141
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:41,032
That flight's been over-booked.
You've been bumped.

142
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:45,770
It wasn't over-booked when I made the reservation.
It happens sometimes.

143
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:49,441
- What's your name?
- Paul. Paul shussler.

144
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:53,111
Paul, this is the champ's
home phone number.

145
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:56,881
- The champ?
- Tell him that Dr. Pope,

146
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,451
his personal psychiatrist,
has been delayed.

147
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:03,755
The boxing champion of the world?
Here, I'll do it!

148
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:07,492
Pardon me. Do you mind?
I'm in a hurry.

149
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,461
I said, I'm a medical person.

150
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:11,896
I have a beeper. Now, back off!

151
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,732
<i>This is Dr. Pope.</i>

152
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:17,469
Get the champ.
It's an emergency.

153
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:21,139
Oh, look! A first-class
seat just opened up.

154
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,841
I could just upgrade you.

155
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:27,178
First class?
Well, if that's all you have.

156
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:33,151
- Would you like champagne, sir?
- Champagne? Yeah, how much?

157
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,321
- There's no charge.
- Really?

158
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,890
Oh, yeah?

159
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,159
And you, sir? No, thank you.

160
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:44,929
I wonder if it would be possible
for me to change my seat?

161
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,965
The flight is completely full.

162
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,901
Thank you.

163
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:59,544
What's up? Miles pope.

164
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:02,881
How do you do? Hey.

165
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:11,489
Wait! Leland carver?

166
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,526
The leland...
you're leland carver?

167
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,529
I thought I recognized you.
I saw your picture.

168
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,532
You're the guy who's putting on the
Shakespeare festival at the lyceum.

169
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:23,468
Would you mind terribly
if we don't speak?

170
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,205
We have to talk.
Do you believe in destiny?

171
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:28,840
No.

172
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,842
Me neither. Total bullshit.

173
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:35,513
Could you get me an audition in "othello"?
I'm an actor.

174
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,316
Of course you are.

175
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,452
I have nothing to do
with that end of the business.

176
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:45,390
Just put in a word for me. My agent's
Harvey Cooper. I'm Miles pope.

177
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,458
Remember that name.
I'm real good.

178
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,494
I'll do what I can.

179
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:52,864
Did I tell you I was
in town doing a movie?

180
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:55,533
Major dramatic lead, major!

181
00:13:55,535 --> 00:14:00,371
Do you die in this movie?

182
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:08,613
<i>Atlantic northern 117.</i>
<i>You are cleared to land.</i>

183
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:13,017
<i>Previous flights report</i>
<i>wind shear 1,500 feet.</i>

184
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,993
They weren't kidding
about that wind shear.

185
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,198
We're 30 knots below reference.

186
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,534
<i>Get the power on fast!</i>

187
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:34,906
- We're losing altitude fast.
- Prepare for emergency landing.

188
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:45,450
This ain't turbulence!
This is bullshit!

189
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:53,458
There ain't no pilot in here.
This is just a closet.

190
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,528
I need to speak to the pilot.
Take your seat!

191
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,632
<i>A fur coat can't fly a plane.</i>
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

192
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:03,968
A fur coat can't fly a plane!

193
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,541
Not the hair, not the hair!

194
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:18,483
Could I have 100 more of these pillows?
Hey! Get a grip on yourself.

195
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:21,619
I don't want to die. Shut the
fuck up and stop sniveling.

196
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:25,924
You're gonna die
so die like a man.

197
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:32,597
Linda, I've had an
affair with Jackie.

198
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,402
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

199
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,405
It's okay. It's okay?

200
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:44,509
I've been having an affair
with Jackie too. What?

201
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,447
I'm scared! You're scared?

202
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:53,418
Kid, you ever hear of Frankie luchino?
Frank luchino?

203
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,455
Sure. Mafia guy. Blew up on a boat.
Uh-uh.

204
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,091
You're sitting next to
Frankie luchino.

205
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,994
You're gonna die
next to royalty.

206
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:07,999
You know how many guys I iced?
Nobody could get me.

207
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:12,704
I spent thousands of bucks on plastic
surgery, years establishing a new I.D.

208
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,540
I outsmarted the fucking FBI...

209
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:19,010
And it's gonna end
like this. Geez!

210
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:24,015
I'm gonna croak on a plane
next to a fucking actor.

211
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:27,552
Well, I'll see you
in hell, kid.

212
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,591
We're still minus 30.

213
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:39,030
Stewardess, could
I get another seat?

214
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:42,066
Air speed's coming back.

215
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:45,737
<i>Air speed, holding steady.</i>

216
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,615
Thank you, God. <i>Ladies and
gentlemen, this is the captain.</i>

217
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:01,753
<i>We just encountered some</i>
<i>very severe turbulence.</i>

218
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:06,724
<i>Everything's okay and we should be on
the ground in just under one minute.</i>

219
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,680
Shit!

220
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,640
For crying out loud!

221
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,693
I got him, I got him!

222
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,800
Hey! What the...

223
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:40,118
I want to report an attempt
on my life. Mm-hmm.

224
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:45,123
Have a seat. Be with you in a second.
This is kinda important.

225
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,825
Where am I supposed to sit?

226
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,894
Nice try, pal.

227
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:53,598
I came to report a crime. So
does everybody who comes in.

228
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,800
I didn't do anything. I know.

229
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,776
Hello? This is ridiculous.

230
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:09,714
I came here to report a crime.
I'm reporting a crime too.

231
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:13,818
Stand here, face forward
and shut up.

232
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,923
That's him! Number four, that's him.
Number four.

233
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,863
Wait a second. Me?
You're kidding.

234
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:28,833
Look, I'm a victim,
not a perpetrator.

235
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,736
That's the man who flashed me.

236
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:34,872
What? I was a boy scout.

237
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,175
Guys, just chill out.

238
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,610
Or maybe...

239
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,780
Number one. Huh?

240
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:46,617
Sorry about that. I was
wondering where you went.

241
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,520
Things like that
happen all the time.

242
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,757
No shit! So what are you gonna do about
this mob guy who's trying to kill me?

243
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:56,594
You're gonna have
to talk to the FBI.

244
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:59,897
Have a nice day. Thanks, man.
Thanks for nothing.

245
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:03,868
Shit, I'm glad
I don't pay no taxes.

246
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,904
¶ How'd you like to find this ¶

247
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,774
¶ waitin' at home
for you every night ¶

248
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,776
¶ only been used
once or twice ¶

249
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:14,912
¶ but it's still
good and tight ¶

250
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,415
<i>¶ but if I can't sell it ¶</i>

251
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,618
<i>¶ I'm going to remain</i>
<i>seated on it ¶</i>

252
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,689
Martha, you seen Duane? ¶ I don't
see the need to give it away ¶

253
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,925
you're questioning my sincerity?
Yes.

254
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:31,862
What do I have to do
to prove...

255
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,864
Aaah!

256
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,734
Oh, God! You're insane.

257
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,770
I'll cut the whole hand off,
but I gotta have you tonight.

258
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,673
We just met ten minutes ago!

259
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:45,676
- I gotta talk to you.
- Not now, Miles.

260
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:49,680
- This is serious.
- Karen, your phone number?

261
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:52,783
The thing is plastic.
He does this all the time.

262
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:56,954
Wait a minute, he's right!

263
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:00,625
Karen, I think I can explain.

264
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:07,865
Sorry, man, I had to do it.
I'm in big, fucking trouble.

265
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:10,334
You're goddamn right
you're in trouble.

266
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,403
I met this guy on the plane.

267
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:16,440
We were sitting next to each other
when we had this emergency.

268
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:20,611
Everybody was flipping out except for this guy.
He was beyond fear.

269
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:24,382
He started telling me he was Frankie
luchino, the one everybody thinks is dead.

270
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:27,985
He's got this new identity
and he's trying to kill me.

271
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:32,790
These things happen. What the
fuck is that supposed to mean?

272
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,793
What's the problem? You moved
eight times in the past year!

273
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,430
You got finance companies
looking for you.

274
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:42,800
If they can't find you,
how will this guy?

275
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,036
I don't know. <i>Listen, Miles,</i>

276
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,372
I wouldn't steer you wrong.
I'm your best friend.

277
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:51,375
It's over.
He'll never find you.

278
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,878
Good, good.

279
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,767
Hello, Lulu.

280
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,737
Welcome back, Mr. Carver.
Nice to see you.

281
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:22,540
Thank you. Is my wife at home?
Yes, she is.

282
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:26,811
That will be all. Thank you.
Very well.

283
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,846
Come here.

284
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,816
I want you to call Tony
in Vegas.

285
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:35,953
Find me somebody reliable, somebody
I don't know and who don't know me.

286
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:40,891
By this time tomorrow, I want that pope kid dead.
Boss, it's no big deal.

287
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,728
What can this black guy
prove anyway?

288
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,797
He can set the FBI thinking.

289
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,933
I've been legitimate
far too long.

290
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:51,469
They take my fingerprints,
I'm fucked.

291
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:54,705
You had your fingerprints removed.
They can grow back.

292
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,874
I'll call Tony.

293
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:01,545
<i>Leland, darling.</i>
Hello, darling.

294
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,748
How was your trip?
Just business.

295
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,850
We missed you in Newport...

296
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:08,819
<i>And mommy sends her love.</i>

297
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:14,592
This is kristi. She's working
with Jeremy. Jeremy?

298
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:16,761
Our decorator. Yes, of course.

299
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:18,729
<i>Hello, kristi.</i>
Nice to meet you.

300
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:24,502
I'm sorry to be rude, but I have a
lot of calls to make to California.

301
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:34,472
Hey, who are you?

302
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,507
Where's Harvey?

303
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,943
Harvey's gone out for awhile.

304
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:43,914
I'm a friend of his from Vegas.
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

305
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:48,018
Magic Bruno and his performing
rabbits! Right?

306
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,854
That's right.

307
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:54,191
Harvey told me.
He booked you into the lounge.

308
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,660
Nice venue for a rabbit act.

309
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,863
We're very excited.

310
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:00,898
Yeah.

311
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:08,672
Maybe you better
show me some I.D.

312
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,542
No problem.

313
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:31,295
Now by heaven, my blood
begins my safer guides to rule.

314
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:35,666
And passion, having
my best judgment collied...

315
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:38,569
collied? Colley?

316
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:43,307
And passion, having my best judgment
collied, assays to lead the way.

317
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:47,077
Assays to lead the way.
All right.

318
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,647
Whoo! I gotta get outta here.

319
00:25:55,321 --> 00:26:00,024
But that I loved
the gentle desdemona.

320
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:15,306
<i>We're talking about my life</i>
<i>and you ain't got time?</i>

321
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:19,577
What the guys at the desk
failed to tell you...

322
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:23,013
Is that I'm not in the field anymore.
This is data retrieval.

323
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:25,015
<i>I've got six reports to finish.</i>

324
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,585
I'd like to get outta here
sometime before Christmas.

325
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:30,721
This was your case!
I can't believe you don't care.

326
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:34,325
Look! I spent six years
chasing luchino.

327
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:36,994
I don't wanna spend...

328
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:40,731
<i>One more second</i>
<i>talking about him.</i>

329
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:43,100
Good-bye!

330
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,396
Where the hell have you been?

331
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:16,033
I've been looking for you all night.
What's the matter?

332
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,102
Nothing very important.

333
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:20,704
Just the mob's
trying to kill me.

334
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:24,742
<i>This is the real thing.</i> Tommy, can
you give us a couple of minutes?

335
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:27,711
Sorry, man.

336
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:36,353
Miles? Miles!

337
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:39,690
Are we gonna make love, or something?
<i>You know what happened to me?</i>

338
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:41,792
I'm walking out
of my apartment.

339
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:45,396
Suddenly there's bullets flying
and the Terminator's on my ass.

340
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:48,332
Someone is trying to kill you?

341
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:52,269
- Ah, a breakthrough!
- Why don't you go to the cops?

342
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,271
I went. Nobody believes me.

343
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:56,407
You gotta help me
disappear now!

344
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:59,810
- Me help you disappear?
- How many times? Yes!

345
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,715
Step into my office.

346
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:07,117
Thanks, man.

347
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,288
Just have a seat.
I'm gonna help you disappear.

348
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,391
A haircut ain't gonna make it.
This is not gonna be a haircut.

349
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:17,695
Neither is a massage. It's not
gonna be a massage either.

350
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,763
All right. Good.

351
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:26,136
<i>What are you doin', man?</i>
<i>What are you putting on me?</i>

352
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:29,406
<i>Keep still.</i>
<i>You're gonna look fabulous.</i>

353
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:32,476
Can I look yet? No,
keep your eyes closed.

354
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:35,479
This stuff needs
another second to dry.

355
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:38,716
Look, keep an open mind.

356
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:41,151
Okay.

357
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:44,722
All right.
You can open your eyes now.

358
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,757
Keep an open mind.

359
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:50,828
Aaah! You made me into a white guy?
I can't believe this!

360
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,831
What's the matter with you?
I wanted to look like prince.

361
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:58,769
You made me look like Wayne Newton
without the little mustache.

362
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:02,139
Relax. This is genius.
They're looking for a black guy.

363
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:05,776
You're a totally safe Caucasian
who's going to live.

364
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:09,913
Get this stuff off me.
Nobody is gonna believe...

365
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,516
- That I am a white guy.
- Why not?

366
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:16,353
Read my lips... Which for a white
person are extremely visible.

367
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:19,389
I do not want to be white!

368
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:21,425
You're an actor.

369
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:25,362
Look at this as
the performance for your life.

370
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:29,299
Don't give me that bullshit.
I traced my roots.

371
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:32,870
I know who I am
and it's not ward cleaver.

372
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:36,340
When I think of my favorite
people, a lot of 'em ain't white.

373
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:38,542
Do you have a better idea?

374
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:55,159
<i>¶ Release yourself ¶</i>

375
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:57,895
<i>¶ just let it go ¶</i>

376
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,806
<i>¶ said I gotta go underground ¶</i>

377
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,579
<i>¶ hallelujah to</i>
<i>the underground ¶</i>

378
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,948
this ain't gonna make it,
brother.

379
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,385
Look at the way these
white people are walking.

380
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:24,154
<i>They walk with their</i>
<i>butts real tight.</i>

381
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:27,391
They're the reason God
invented talcum powder.

382
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:30,460
Look at him.

383
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:34,865
You're a crazy son-of-a-bitch.

384
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:37,367
Taxi?

385
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:44,975
Great. Hey?

386
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:53,417
Come on, man.
You know you see me.

387
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:58,989
There you go, brother.

388
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:02,526
Thanks, man. Peace.

389
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:11,034
Yo, lady, that's my cab.
I saw it first.

390
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:14,938
Lady, I gotta get outta town.
I'm in a hurry!

391
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,643
Greenwich village, man. Penn
station and take the park.

392
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:25,015
Wait a minute. Haven't we met?
I don't think so.

393
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:28,552
- Your face is very familiar.
- It's that kind of face.

394
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:44,935
I know! You're at the
bond desk at merrill lynch!

395
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:48,672
Andrea Clark, Dean witter. Yes,
I remember you had a long name.

396
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:51,942
And you're? Perry, Perry white.

397
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:56,446
Perry, of course. I'm terrible with
names but I never forget a face.

398
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,448
So, Perry, how have you been?

399
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,652
Oh, just great...
Since they let me out.

400
00:32:01,654 --> 00:32:04,955
- You're out of the business?
- No, no, no.

401
00:32:04,957 --> 00:32:08,091
- Out of jail.
- Insider dealing?

402
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:11,995
I got 4 to 6 hard for knocking
off a bank in queens.

403
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:15,399
I was in jail, had a
boyfriend, I was the wife.

404
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:17,668
Stop the cab! <i>Took steroids.</i>

405
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:25,409
Anytime, baby. I've been
pumping iron especially for you.

406
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:31,715
The village, man.

407
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:37,387
You want to confirm the hit?

408
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:40,724
Be here in 15. Yeah.

409
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:50,734
Maybe next time, brother.

410
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,639
Where is he?

411
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,675
Where's pope?

412
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:07,084
I'm not sure where he went.

413
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:10,387
Well, you've got a key.

414
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:12,990
I'm just sharing
the apartment...

415
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:15,559
Which has some exciting
upscale potential.

416
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,528
- You been looking long?
- I'm not looking.

417
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,999
This unit is a superb buy
for the low 6's.

418
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:25,635
<i>I know, you're thinking</i>
<i>"the war zone."</i>

419
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:28,705
But the war zone look
is going to be huge.

420
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:31,074
The neighborhood
is pre-transitional.

421
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:33,710
The unit has 7-foot ceilings...

422
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:37,581
That are highlighted
with gold fleck.

423
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:42,452
<i>Look, I have a 6-page brochure in my car.
Why don't I get it?</i>

424
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:44,054
Shut up.

425
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:49,726
What's with your feet?

426
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,702
My mother was black.
I'm a mulatto.

427
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:01,638
Just your feet?

428
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,410
No, from the waist down.
That's how it happens sometimes.

429
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:09,446
Yeah. Show me.

430
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:53,156
Duane, help me!

431
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,800
My radio.

432
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:05,795
Jesus. He put up a real fight.

433
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:10,767
I'm Anthony.
We talked on the phone.

434
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:15,505
Wait a minute. This isn't pope!

435
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,574
Miles pope is black.
Who's this guy?

436
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:21,611
He lives down the hall.
He was here feeding the fish.

437
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:24,781
He was just feeding the
fish and you whacked him?

438
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:27,651
Jesus, lamotta,
two civilians in one day.

439
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:30,720
<i>You still haven't found pope.</i>

440
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:33,323
<i>Jesus, carver's</i>
<i>gonna be pissed.</i>

441
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,892
<i>He was pissed when I told</i>
<i>him about the janitor.</i>

442
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:39,796
We better keep this one
between us.

443
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:42,699
<i>I know a place</i>
<i>we can dump the body.</i>

444
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,669
<i>I used to use it all the time.</i>

445
00:36:45,671 --> 00:36:48,371
So you wanna use my car
or yours?

446
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,775
Let's take yours.
I think I'm gonna dump mine.

447
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:55,612
Smart, smart. Careful.
I like that.

448
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:58,915
- What are you doing?
- I took my shoes off.

449
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:01,785
Always do when I fight.
Better traction.

450
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:06,756
You're a fucking animal.
Get the other end.

451
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,659
What? Get his feet.

452
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:13,597
We'll roll him up in the carpet.
We'll take him down.

453
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,865
Jesus! He weighs a ton!

454
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:20,737
I think we should chop him up and
take him down piece by piece.

455
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,874
Come on. Get the other end.

456
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:52,769
Talk of memories, huh?

457
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:57,774
I've used this place
a hundred times.

458
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:36,413
I feel like
a fucking kid again.

459
00:38:36,415 --> 00:38:39,783
So, lamotta,
what kind of gun you use?

460
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:42,452
Gun?

461
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:44,954
Right. Well, you know...

462
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,990
I use what I always use.

463
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:52,495
Which is what? Nemmler... 86.

464
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,998
Nemmler?
Never heard of that gun.

465
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,902
It's a new company.
I got a promotional model.

466
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:01,404
86 caliber?
That's a big number.

467
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:03,707
What do you do
about the recoil?

468
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:06,943
You don't have to worry.
It's self-coiling.

469
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:10,947
Self-coiling.
Never heard of that either.

470
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:15,485
I feel like I just got into the business.
Should be taking notes.

471
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:19,022
Excuse me.

472
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,934
Yeah. Hi, boss.

473
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:33,870
No, pope wasn't there.

474
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:42,479
Lamotta? Hey, lamotta?

475
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:45,949
That was the boss.
He wants to see you.

476
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:50,453
He wants to see me? Now? Uh-huh.

477
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:53,923
I'll call him... Tomorrow.

478
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:58,428
If the man wants to see you,
you go to see him.

479
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,830
Otherwise he can get
very upset.

480
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,967
And we wouldn't want that,
would we?

481
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:08,571
Oh, and don't worry.
I didn't mention the stiff.

482
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,541
Paisans, right?

483
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:13,576
Come on!

484
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:19,048
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>
<i>Leave roses?</i>

485
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:34,597
Leland, you can't pretend...

486
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,867
Sponsorship of the arts
isn't a perfect tax deduction.

487
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:41,938
I'm not saying it doesn't
make financial sense.

488
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,441
But that's really not why
I'm involved, senator.

489
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:47,010
Culture is the lifeblood
of New York City.

490
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:50,847
Without it, we may as well
be living in Los Angeles.

491
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:58,488
<i>That's very good.</i>

492
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:02,859
Mr. Carver, I brought
Mr. Lamotta like you said.

493
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:15,872
Gentlemen,

494
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:18,475
I wonder if you'd excuse me?

495
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:21,544
A little urgent business
has come up.

496
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:25,014
I won't be a moment. Certainly.

497
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:28,251
Watch how I handle this.

498
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:34,657
What the fuck have you got in there?
Meatballs?

499
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,627
You said to bring him. Not
through the goddamn front door.

500
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:41,264
<i>I've got a senator</i>
<i>and the d.A. Out there.</i>

501
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:44,033
Sorry, boss. I wasn't thinking.

502
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:51,975
What the hell have you
got to say for yourself?

503
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:54,677
It's been a day and a half.

504
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:58,581
Pope is still alive and the only stiff
you brought me is a lousy janitor.

505
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:01,217
These things happen.

506
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:04,954
- What is that supposed to mean?
- It means what it means.

507
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:07,957
I'm paying you 100 grand
and you are giving me attitude?

508
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:12,562
I want this taken care
of quick and quiet.

509
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:14,998
What is the problem here, huh?

510
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,600
He's just a kid, a lousy actor.

511
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:20,003
There's too many of 'em anyway.

512
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:22,639
If you can't handle this,
tell me now...

513
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:25,642
And I'll get somebody else
for half the price.

514
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:28,278
No-no-no. I'm your man.

515
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,881
I want pope dead!
You understand?

516
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:37,320
You rip him open, cut
him up and make sandwiches.

517
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:41,558
Understand? Do it
by tomorrow morning.

518
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:46,029
Sandwiches. Tomorrow morning.
Piece of cake.

519
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:50,066
So, how's Tony?

520
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:54,737
Tony?

521
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,574
Tony's Tony. You know Tony.

522
00:42:57,576 --> 00:43:01,578
He'll always be... Tony.
Capisci?

523
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,013
Yeah.

524
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:06,082
Fucking a. Fucking a.

525
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:14,691
He's never gonna change, right?
No! He's never gonna change.

526
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:17,093
Hey! Hey.

527
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:24,267
<i>Leland?</i> Hello, darling.

528
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:28,304
Dear, I thought you were
still with the politicians.

529
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:32,108
I was, but there's no problem if
you'd like to measure in here.

530
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,011
I don't believe we've met.

531
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:38,348
This is Mr. Lamont.

532
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:41,651
He's a friend of mine
from Florida.

533
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:44,787
Mr. Lamont is more
interested in kristi.

534
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:48,358
It's, um... I mean...

535
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,629
Ah... you look
just like my sister.

536
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:55,031
Hmm.

537
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:57,734
By marriage! Sister-in-law.

538
00:43:57,736 --> 00:44:01,638
Well, she is the most
beautiful decorator.

539
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,374
And she's doing our whole house.
If ever you need...

540
00:44:04,376 --> 00:44:06,809
I'll keep it in mind.

541
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:10,380
- We'll let you finish.
- We'll see you in a moment.

542
00:44:10,382 --> 00:44:14,751
Kristi, let's go do
the bedrooms.

543
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:18,788
Tomorrow morning.

544
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:06,302
S-s-shit!

545
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:08,371
<i>Is this the FBI?</i>

546
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:11,774
Could you put me through
to Mr. Houston, please?

547
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:14,343
This is Miles pope, again.

548
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:16,846
<i>Tell him I called.</i>

549
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:19,816
So... this is how you
white people live?

550
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:22,151
Not bad!

551
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:24,787
Have some room service. I ordered
the whole left side of the menu.

552
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:29,125
Miles, you should join
a support group.

553
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:31,427
- What?
- A support group.

554
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:34,864
Where people in the same situation get together.
<i>The same situation?</i>

555
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:38,768
I'm passing for white. I've been
hired to find and kill myself.

556
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,771
That's a common problem.
That's a fucking epidemic!

557
00:45:41,773 --> 00:45:43,773
Miles, calm down, man.

558
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:45,908
I can't calm down.

559
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,779
The whole white-face makeup
thing is a nightmare.

560
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:54,817
I gotta get my life back. I'm gonna go
home and say, "mammy, don't you know me?"

561
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:57,453
Wait a minute!
There was a girl.

562
00:45:57,455 --> 00:46:01,390
She worked for Mrs. Carver.
She was a decorator.

563
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:04,494
- All right!
- Maybe she knows something.

564
00:46:04,496 --> 00:46:09,132
She's been all over that house.
Maybe she's seen a secret safe.

565
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:11,367
All right.

566
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:20,443
Hello, I'd like to speak
to Mrs. Rita carver, please.

567
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:23,179
Thank you.

568
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:25,414
Rita, darling. Hello.

569
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:27,817
It's lord Percy chisley
pithee-Smythe...

570
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:29,852
Of South worchestershire
upon avon.

571
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:32,822
<i>I want to speak to you</i>
<i>about your decorator.</i>

572
00:46:32,824 --> 00:46:34,891
<i>Everyone is talking about her.</i>

573
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:37,927
That's marvelous.

574
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:41,798
Yes. Uh-huh.

575
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,467
Soho! How spiffy.

576
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:47,336
Wonderful!
Thank you, Rita, darling.

577
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:50,907
Love you more than
life itself. Ciao.

578
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:55,545
Duane, listen.

579
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:58,948
Do you still have the key to
your wardrobe department?

580
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,328
Who'd you say you were?
Darryl brown, James' brother.

581
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,364
James brown. <i>The</i> James brown?

582
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:17,466
Hey!

583
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:22,438
Hit man! Right on, baby.

584
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,576
<i>A friend of mine gave me</i>
<i>your name. Rita carver?</i>

585
00:47:26,578 --> 00:47:30,546
- You know Rita?
- Yeah, I'm into art and shit.

586
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:33,916
She told me you was doing some
radical bullshit up here.

587
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:35,985
I'm loaded and ready to buy.

588
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:39,922
Do you mind if I take a look around?
Well, come...

589
00:47:39,924 --> 00:47:43,960
what a delightful apartment.
Very urban. Good God.

590
00:47:43,962 --> 00:47:47,563
Hey! Looks like massio!

591
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:50,900
Ohhh! I love doors!

592
00:47:50,902 --> 00:47:53,536
My house is full of doors.
I'll buy it.

593
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:55,938
How do you know Rita carver?

594
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:00,576
She's a friend of James'.
They dated for awhile.

595
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:03,646
<i>Don't tell nobody</i>
<i>I told you that.</i>

596
00:48:03,648 --> 00:48:06,582
I hates to gossip,

597
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:10,486
but have you heard that
rumor about her old man?

598
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:13,923
About how he's some big-time mobster?
Had his face redone.

599
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:18,060
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Who you calling ridiculous?

600
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:21,964
<i>You never seen any little</i>
<i>secret hiding places?</i>

601
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:25,468
<i>Or one secret room?</i>

602
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:28,905
Or places where you're
never supposed to go?

603
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:32,675
Have you got any I.D. On you?

604
00:48:32,677 --> 00:48:34,944
This one is real superb.

605
00:48:34,946 --> 00:48:38,648
I love the way the jeans bunch up
into his... you're bullshitting me!

606
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,350
Mrs. Carver never dated
no James brown.

607
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:43,619
I swear on my
brother's parole board.

608
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:49,425
Aaah!

609
00:48:52,664 --> 00:48:55,498
You nuked me! You'll
be shaky for awhile.

610
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,434
Start talking!

611
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:02,605
I'm an actor. Miles pope.

612
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,642
I'm in a lot of trouble.
I need your help.

613
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:10,646
- What are you talking about?
- Leland carver.

614
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:15,451
That's what this is about! You're trying to
pump me for information about my client.

615
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:18,054
Your client is trying to kill me.
Give me a break!

616
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:21,390
You haven't said a truthful word.
Now you expect me to believe this?

617
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:23,659
I can explain.

618
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:27,630
All right. Just don't
"taze" me again.

619
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,469
Look... I really
did like the door.

620
00:49:42,714 --> 00:49:45,047
Only in New York.

621
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:02,765
Hello?

622
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:10,473
What are you doing here?

623
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:14,710
What are you doing here, Mr. "No-pants"...
Or do I need to ask?

624
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:18,581
No, you don't have to ask.
<i>Duane, honey,</i>

625
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:21,450
<i>is that the champagne</i>
<i>and lobster you ordered?</i>

626
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:24,053
No, cherise, it's the maid.

627
00:50:24,055 --> 00:50:26,055
Come here, man.

628
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:29,425
The mob's trying to kill me and you're
ordering champagne and lobster?

629
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:33,396
Some guy called who said
his name was... Anthony.

630
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:35,765
<i>He wanted you to confirm</i>
<i>if the package was delivered.</i>

631
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:38,667
If not, he would make
other arrangements.

632
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:41,470
Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

633
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:43,672
<i>What does it mean?</i>

634
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:54,050
<i>Are you gonna leave now?</i>

635
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:56,118
I'm gonna make a phone call.
Is that okay?

636
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,789
It's okay, but can you
not make it too long?

637
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:02,691
Cherise doesn't like
a lot of noise.

638
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:04,760
It breaks her concentration.

639
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:12,535
Hello. Can I speak
to Mr. Carver, please?

640
00:51:12,537 --> 00:51:14,804
It's a matter
of life and death.

641
00:51:14,806 --> 00:51:18,607
Tell him it's Mr. Lamont
from Florida.

642
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:20,743
Where is he?

643
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:23,579
Golf course? Which golf course?

644
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,714
Can you get in touch with him?

645
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:28,651
When are you
expecting him back?

646
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:31,487
Shit no.
I can't wait that long.

647
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:37,693
<i>If I'm lying, I'm flying.</i>

648
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:42,498
You're the first brother
I had in here all day.

649
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,601
<i>When I say "brother"...</i>

650
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,870
I mean African-American.

651
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:51,540
It's crucial for people
to remember their heritage.

652
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:55,845
Absolutely. <i>Brothers today don't
want to know about the struggle.</i>

653
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:58,647
<i>I start talkin' about</i>
<i>the struggle, they say,</i>

654
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:01,484
<i>"step on it, please.</i>
<i>I'm in a hurry."</i>

655
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:04,653
I'm kinda in a rush myself.

656
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,822
Uncle Toms and wanna-be's, man.

657
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:11,460
They don't know who they are,
Brooks brothers suits and all.

658
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:14,497
<i>They're ashamed of themselves.
</i> I heard that.

659
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:17,199
We, as a people,
gotta stand up...

660
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:19,635
And say "we're black
and we're proud of it."

661
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:22,671
<i>Right?</i> Absolutely.

662
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:32,848
There's only one way for a black man
to make it in a white man's world.

663
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:37,520
Great googa-mooga!

664
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:46,896
Where's Mr. Carver playing? I
don't believe he's started yet.

665
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:49,632
He's probably still in
the locker room. Thanks.

666
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:51,734
You're welcome.

667
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:04,847
Mr. Carver, I believe
we have a visitor.

668
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:12,521
I didn't know you were a member
of this club, Mr. Lamont.

669
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,923
We gotta talk.

670
00:53:13,925 --> 00:53:17,893
I don't discuss business
in public. Kindly leave.

671
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:22,331
We have to talk.
This business is important.

672
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,836
Come with me.

673
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:40,683
Now what's so
fucking important?

674
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:45,387
It's about pope. I need a
little more time. More time?

675
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:48,757
I'm not asking you to whack the
president of the United States.

676
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:53,395
This is some fucking actor
with no talent and no future.

677
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:56,365
I want him
permanently cancelled.

678
00:53:56,367 --> 00:54:00,903
I don't know. I hear it's only
time before he makes it real big.

679
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:03,672
What?

680
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:05,874
Geez, it's hot in here.

681
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:10,946
Whoo! I don't want
no more excuses.

682
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:16,685
Either you whack this spook
or I get somebody else.

683
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:18,687
Spook?

684
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:21,890
Yeah, spook.
You've got 24 hours.

685
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:24,994
And if you don't mind,
I wanna start my game...

686
00:54:24,996 --> 00:54:27,963
Unless you got something
else on your tiny mind.

687
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:29,832
Hey.

688
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:31,767
Hey...

689
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:34,870
What's that black shit
running down your forehead?

690
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:39,675
What? Yeah... You
got black shit.

691
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:41,977
It's disgusting.

692
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:45,614
Oh, shit! It's...

693
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,683
It's my hair dye.

694
00:54:47,685 --> 00:54:50,919
Every time I do a job,
I change my hair color...

695
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:53,622
In case there's, you know,
witnesses.

696
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,892
You leave witnesses? No, no, course not.
I'm a professional.

697
00:54:56,894 --> 00:55:00,796
It's been nice talkin' to you,
but I really gotta go.

698
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,699
I got a lot of whacking to do.

699
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:06,402
Another day,
another whack-a-roonio.

700
00:55:06,404 --> 00:55:10,639
Lamotta, first you whack
Miles pope.

701
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:14,777
Then you whack the guy
who gave you that dye job.

702
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:27,856
Make a mental note. Kill Duane.

703
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:43,806
All right.

704
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:34,890
What are these? All from the
same person, Miles pope.

705
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:38,460
Pope? The actor who told you
the luchino fairy tale.

706
00:56:38,462 --> 00:56:41,897
He's been calling every
two-and-a-half minutes.

707
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:46,568
Look, kid. I wanna believe you.

708
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,738
Luchino cost me my marriage,

709
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:53,809
my job and
the lives of five agents.

710
00:56:53,811 --> 00:56:57,012
Jesus, I need to believe you.

711
00:56:57,014 --> 00:56:59,815
But as far as
the bureau is concerned,

712
00:56:59,817 --> 00:57:03,452
you're another crackpot
and I'm another old-timer.

713
00:57:05,456 --> 00:57:09,458
What counts as hard evidence
apart from a bullet in my chest?

714
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,927
Anything that connects
carver with his old life.

715
00:57:13,898 --> 00:57:16,999
He's gotta have an office,
somewhere where he works.

716
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:21,203
<i>You gotta get in and search it.</i>

717
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:23,439
Me?

718
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,607
This may come as
a surprise to you,

719
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:29,011
but not every black person from the
inner city is good at that shit.

720
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:31,847
I never ripped off
a car stereo. Ever!

721
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:35,784
It seems to me, Miles,

722
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:38,487
if you are telling the truth...

723
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:41,590
<i>You got nothing to lose.</i>

724
00:57:41,592 --> 00:57:44,893
Either you find something
and I bring him in...

725
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:47,930
Or you're a dead man,
my friend.

726
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,504
<i>Hey, kristi.</i>

727
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:57,506
Give me a minute.
I need to talk to you.

728
00:57:57,508 --> 00:57:59,641
I thought I made myself clear.
You're pissed off,

729
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:02,244
I know. Let me explain.

730
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:07,049
The Darryl brown thing
was bullshit. I'm sorry.

731
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:09,985
These are for you.
You probably stole them.

732
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:13,522
You bet, I had to
break into the flower shop.

733
00:58:13,524 --> 00:58:16,859
Leland carver has
hired someone to kill me.

734
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:20,496
- My friend made me white.
- But you're black.

735
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:24,233
At the moment. Whenever
I need to be, I'm white.

736
00:58:24,235 --> 00:58:27,536
You're insane. It's my
life that's insane.

737
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:30,539
You gotta believe me
'cause I need you to help.

738
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:35,611
- I really do.
- Miles, you're cute.

739
00:58:35,613 --> 00:58:37,646
Call me when you're better.

740
00:58:37,648 --> 00:58:40,282
Kristi.

741
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:51,894
Here you go, brother.
Thank you, brother.

742
00:59:03,307 --> 00:59:06,308
<i>Check this out, man.</i>

743
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:09,578
Yo, man, you're
a long way from home.

744
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,914
You lost or stupid?

745
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:15,918
<i>I think he's stupid.</i>
<i>You'll get hurt, white boy.</i>

746
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,621
Around here my favorite
people ain't white.

747
01:00:03,734 --> 01:00:05,734
Hi.

748
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:08,704
Mr. Lamont, Mr. Carver's
friend from Florida.

749
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:12,341
Kristi, you don't know
how wrong you are.

750
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:22,586
Miles?

751
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,663
<i>I don't believe</i>
<i>we're doing this.</i>

752
01:00:34,665 --> 01:00:37,399
<i>I want my life back.
Do you think anybody's home?</i>

753
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:39,635
They're at sotheby's.

754
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:42,037
I marked a bunch of stuff
in the catalog. Let's go.

755
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:44,373
Did you get a key? Yes.

756
01:00:49,013 --> 01:00:51,079
I'll go in here.
You take the bedroom.

757
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:53,782
Miles... we don't have time.

758
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:10,732
Hey. Hey!

759
01:01:10,734 --> 01:01:13,402
I don't have time for this.

760
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:15,437
Honey, whose car is that?

761
01:01:15,439 --> 01:01:18,940
It's kristi. She must
be here with the fabric.

762
01:01:22,813 --> 01:01:25,814
<i>Kristi?</i>

763
01:01:33,724 --> 01:01:36,058
<i>Hello, kristi.</i>

764
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:40,696
Are you here with the swatches?
No, no, no.

765
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:44,366
I had to remeasure the uh...

766
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:46,802
the master bedroom.

767
01:01:46,804 --> 01:01:49,371
They didn't lose
the measurements again?

768
01:01:54,111 --> 01:01:56,411
First, it was the tile.
Now, it's the curtains.

769
01:01:56,413 --> 01:01:59,147
I've got to make phone calls.
I'll be in my study.

770
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:03,151
No. Is there a problem?

771
01:02:03,153 --> 01:02:05,153
No, no.

772
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:08,090
Oh my God! Oh my God!

773
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:13,361
I would like you to look at the
valances in the guest bedroom.

774
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:17,332
I'll take a look. First, I'm
going to make some phone calls.

775
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:21,336
Hi.

776
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:29,778
Frankie, salut.

777
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:33,915
What the fuck
are you doing here?

778
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,918
What am I doing here?

779
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,087
I could ask you
the same question.

780
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:42,824
- I live here.
- You live here.

781
01:02:42,826 --> 01:02:46,461
I'm asking
the goddamned questions.

782
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:52,467
Mr. Lamont and I have
business. Leave us alone.

783
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:55,771
Close the door, please.

784
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:09,384
You got 10 seconds to tell
me what you're doing here...

785
01:03:09,386 --> 01:03:13,355
<i>Or I am gonna tear the</i>
<i>heart outta your chest,</i>

786
01:03:13,357 --> 01:03:15,457
and rip that nose
off your face.

787
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:17,893
<i>And give me those!</i>

788
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:23,899
The fact is, I got good news.
Miles pope...

789
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:26,535
<i>Is dead.</i>

790
01:03:26,537 --> 01:03:29,805
<i>I want confirmation.</i>

791
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:33,508
Ah, well,

792
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,510
confirmation?

793
01:03:35,512 --> 01:03:37,546
The thing is, you know,

794
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:40,949
when you said sandwiches
you gave me inspiration.

795
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:43,952
I ripped off his head.
I made minestrone outta brains.

796
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:47,322
I ripped out his intestines.
That was chow mein.

797
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:50,192
I crunched his nuts and
sprinkled 'em like croutons.

798
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:52,861
<i>The guy is dead.</i>
I'll send Anthony.

799
01:03:52,863 --> 01:03:54,963
Don't leave town.
Get outta my house.

800
01:03:54,965 --> 01:03:58,934
<i>Beat it. I never wanna</i>
<i>see your face again.</i>

801
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:02,003
You're the boss, of course.

802
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:53,488
It's beautiful.

803
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:55,657
It's fucking beauti...

804
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:10,639
he bought it.

805
01:05:10,641 --> 01:05:13,008
- I told you, man.
<i>- Thanks, man.</i>

806
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,043
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

807
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:18,613
- I should get an Oscar.
- First, get me out.

808
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:20,916
Oh, sure.

809
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:25,654
Can you believe this?

810
01:05:25,656 --> 01:05:28,023
Oh, God.

811
01:05:28,025 --> 01:05:31,393
You look lovely. Thanks.
Let's get some pizza.

812
01:05:31,395 --> 01:05:33,662
<i>Miles?</i>

813
01:05:33,664 --> 01:05:36,031
Hey, where you been?

814
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:38,633
Been looking
everywhere for you.

815
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:41,970
How'd you find me? Your friend told me...
The crazy guy.

816
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:45,440
Duane. Great. Now take a hike.

817
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,976
I love your sense
of humor. Now listen.

818
01:05:47,978 --> 01:05:50,578
I managed to get
you that audition.

819
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,581
- What audition?
- Othello, 4:00.

820
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:57,519
It opens Friday.
It'll be cast by now.

821
01:05:57,521 --> 01:05:59,654
Trust me. Their lead got sick.

822
01:05:59,656 --> 01:06:01,990
James Earl Jones got sick?

823
01:06:01,992 --> 01:06:06,528
Whoever. They gotta recast.
You wanna kiss me?

824
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:09,531
<i>Right there.</i>

825
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:12,701
Had it pleased heaven
to try me with affliction,

826
01:06:12,703 --> 01:06:16,972
had they rained down all
kinds of sores and shames...

827
01:06:16,974 --> 01:06:20,408
Upon my bare head...

828
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:23,645
thank you, that was...
thank you.

829
01:06:25,682 --> 01:06:29,017
Hi, Miles. I wanna talk to you.

830
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:33,421
Listen. This is crazy.

831
01:06:33,423 --> 01:06:35,657
Even if you get the part
you can't take it.

832
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:37,692
Carver will know
you're still alive.

833
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:40,662
I can't take the part
but I can audition.

834
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:44,466
I've worked too long for a
break like this to flush it.

835
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:47,669
I've wanted to do this
since I was nine years old.

836
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:50,538
No matter what, I want to
know if I could have made it.

837
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,507
Miles pope, please.

838
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:55,777
<i>Miles pope, please.</i>

839
01:06:55,779 --> 01:06:59,514
Good I... break a leg.

840
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:09,024
All right, we're ready.

841
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:14,696
Excuse me, you
forgot your script.

842
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:17,766
It's all right.
I know the play.

843
01:07:24,574 --> 01:07:27,776
Had it pleased heaven
to try me with affliction,

844
01:07:27,778 --> 01:07:32,547
had they rained all kinds of
sores and shames on my head,

845
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:35,650
steeped me in poverty
to the very lips,

846
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:38,787
given to captivity
me and my utmost hopes,

847
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:42,590
I should have found in
some place of my soul...

848
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:44,692
<i>A drop of patience.</i>

849
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:47,662
But there where
I have guarded my heart,

850
01:07:47,664 --> 01:07:52,767
<i>where either I must</i>
<i>live or bear no life,</i>

851
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:55,470
the fountain from the
which my current runs...

852
01:07:56,807 --> 01:07:59,107
thank you.

853
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:03,078
<i>Thank you, that</i>
<i>was amazingly good.</i>

854
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,846
We don't have to look further.
You are the understudy.

855
01:08:04,848 --> 01:08:08,583
The understudy?

856
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,819
The understudy!

857
01:08:10,821 --> 01:08:14,122
Your agent didn't... oh!

858
01:08:14,124 --> 01:08:17,125
This is an emergency call.
We open tomorrow.

859
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:20,295
- Our understudy got sick.
- The understudy got sick?

860
01:08:20,297 --> 01:08:22,664
My agent told me I'd
be reading for the lead...

861
01:08:22,666 --> 01:08:27,702
To replace James Earl Jones.
Afraid not, kid.

862
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:39,481
You're good, but
you're not that good.

863
01:08:39,483 --> 01:08:43,618
You were fantastic. I gave my last
performance and I got the understudy.

864
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,554
Why does it have to be
the last performance?

865
01:08:46,556 --> 01:08:49,124
There are actors in Detroit.
You can start over.

866
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:51,860
I don't want to start over.
This is my home.

867
01:08:51,862 --> 01:08:56,898
I like being me.
I like being Miles pope.

868
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:03,838
Well, if it makes
you feel better,

869
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:07,876
I like Miles pope too.

870
01:09:07,878 --> 01:09:12,747
And I don't want him
to leave either.

871
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:16,151
Really?

872
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:26,594
Do you feel better?

873
01:09:27,731 --> 01:09:30,832
Maybe if we, uh,
did it for longer,

874
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:34,869
you know, deeper.
We might get more of a benefit.

875
01:09:47,918 --> 01:09:51,786
Yeah, that did it. Yeah.

876
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:58,526
I know this place.
It's a hotel.

877
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:02,830
They serve champagne
and they have a vibrating bed.

878
01:10:02,832 --> 01:10:06,334
<i>It's a wonderful thing.</i>
<i>I think you should see it.</i>

879
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:10,638
¶ Zip-a-Dee-doo-dah ¶

880
01:10:25,789 --> 01:10:27,855
Good morning.

881
01:10:27,857 --> 01:10:30,291
Hello, darling.

882
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:34,929
You're up early.
Something wrong?

883
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:38,933
On the contrary,
something is very right.

884
01:10:51,715 --> 01:10:53,715
Excuse me.

885
01:10:57,687 --> 01:10:59,721
Good morning, boss.

886
01:10:59,723 --> 01:11:01,956
Anthony,

887
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:05,393
who's the guy you
brought into my home?

888
01:11:05,395 --> 01:11:08,596
The guy I talked to
in the steam room?

889
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:11,432
Frank lamotta? Oh, yeah?

890
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:14,369
Then who the fuck is this?

891
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:19,907
I don't know. You don't know?

892
01:11:19,909 --> 01:11:22,977
I don't get it.
You don't get it?

893
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:25,747
The guy I brought here is
the guy who killed pope.

894
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:29,784
You told me
Miles pope was dead.

895
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:32,987
He is dead. I saw him sprinkled
all over his apartment.

896
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:35,690
It made me throw up.

897
01:11:35,692 --> 01:11:39,394
This is beginning to
make me feel stupid.

898
01:11:39,396 --> 01:11:41,829
I don't like to feel stupid.

899
01:11:41,831 --> 01:11:46,768
Get over to lamotta's hotel.
Find out what is going on.

900
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:49,504
<i>Yes, boss.</i>

901
01:13:13,823 --> 01:13:17,158
To think I looked up to you.

902
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,828
I thought you were
the best there was...

903
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:23,398
When you were the white guy.

904
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,434
I tried to order one of those
self-coiling nemmler 86's.

905
01:13:26,436 --> 01:13:30,938
I hate to tell you this,
but there is no such thing.

906
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:35,943
Now, to find out you
were lying to me,

907
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:38,479
leading me on.

908
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:42,049
I have to tell you,
I'm genuinely hurt.

909
01:13:42,051 --> 01:13:46,788
Would it do any good
if I said I was sorry?

910
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:49,590
No, it wouldn't do any good.

911
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:51,826
But you know what?

912
01:13:51,828 --> 01:13:56,097
Splattering your brains over
this bed's gonna make me better.

913
01:13:58,468 --> 01:14:01,569
Are you okay? No, I'm dead.

914
01:14:01,571 --> 01:14:05,206
Look at this. Did you kill him?

915
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:08,509
I can't believe this.

916
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,845
Carver must know
I'm still alive.

917
01:14:10,847 --> 01:14:12,847
We gotta get outta here now!

918
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:16,050
No, we have Anthony.
We can take him to the FBI.

919
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:20,455
He'll deny everything. They have
that code of silence thing.

920
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:22,590
He'll never talk.

921
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:25,493
Carver will never stop.
I'm a dead man.

922
01:14:25,495 --> 01:14:28,596
Miles. He'll track me
down like an animal.

923
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:32,633
Miles. Year after year, day
after day, week after week.

924
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,869
I'm fucking dead.

925
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:37,038
He's gonna corner
me like a rat.

926
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:43,945
What'd you do that for? You do
that when someone's babbling.

927
01:14:43,947 --> 01:14:46,647
Did you have to hit me so hard?

928
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:49,650
Will you help me tie him up?
Yeah.

929
01:14:52,489 --> 01:14:54,589
I've seen Kojak.
I know how to do this.

930
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:57,959
Do you want me...
turn him over.

931
01:14:57,961 --> 01:15:01,195
He's so heavy. He's a mobster.
What do you expect?

932
01:15:01,197 --> 01:15:03,865
Why can't you put
pressure on him?

933
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:06,934
Make him believe the bureau's
taking Miles seriously.

934
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:10,938
- There's nothing I can do.
- Wait a minute.

935
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:13,875
There's got to be
something we can do.

936
01:15:13,877 --> 01:15:15,943
There is.

937
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:36,097
I can't believe
that punk fooled me.

938
01:15:36,099 --> 01:15:38,232
Me!

939
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:40,868
He fooled me too, boss.

940
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:45,106
King Kong in a dress
would fool you.

941
01:15:45,108 --> 01:15:48,609
Boss, I think we got a tail.

942
01:15:48,611 --> 01:15:50,978
They look like feds.

943
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:53,881
You don't think they're
startin' to believe pope?

944
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:56,050
Take me home, Anthony.

945
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:20,074
- Well?
- Guido's man in the bureau...

946
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:23,010
Said he hadn't heard
anything about surveillance.

947
01:16:23,012 --> 01:16:26,347
But pope has been with
Houston 3 or 4 times,

948
01:16:26,349 --> 01:16:28,583
so he didn't rule it out.

949
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:31,285
Houston? Oh, Jesus.

950
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:33,621
I called pope's agent.

951
01:16:33,623 --> 01:16:36,324
Guy didn't know
anything, except...

952
01:16:36,326 --> 01:16:38,259
what?

953
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:41,295
He said pope wasn't
going anywhere...

954
01:16:41,297 --> 01:16:43,731
'Cause he'd gotten the
understudy to the lead...

955
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:46,000
In your "othello."

956
01:16:46,002 --> 01:16:51,238
Miles pope
got a part in my play?

957
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:55,076
He combined sensitivity
with great strength.

958
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:58,079
Shut up! This kid's
playing with me.

959
01:16:58,081 --> 01:17:00,281
It ain't gonna last.

960
01:17:00,283 --> 01:17:03,284
Get to his apartment. See if
he's got feds protecting him.

961
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:05,653
Yes, boss.

962
01:17:05,655 --> 01:17:08,022
Oh, Jesus.

963
01:17:31,681 --> 01:17:33,814
Oh, f...

964
01:17:35,084 --> 01:17:37,718
<i>Class, Miles. Well acted.</i>

965
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,354
Excellent method.

966
01:17:40,356 --> 01:17:42,757
All of you, everyone
was wonderfully...

967
01:17:42,759 --> 01:17:44,759
Fascist!

968
01:17:44,761 --> 01:17:48,095
Thank you.

969
01:17:49,032 --> 01:17:52,433
I can't believe I'm doing this.

970
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,120
Dessert menu, gentlemen.
Thank you.

971
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:19,460
Gelati's homemade here
and the tiramisu...

972
01:18:19,462 --> 01:18:24,465
shut the fuck up, Anthony,
and let me think.

973
01:18:27,837 --> 01:18:30,137
They must be coaching
him for the grand jury.

974
01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:32,373
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

975
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:37,044
Once the feds sniff, it's gonna be a
piece of cake to find out who I am.

976
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:41,148
We're gonna have to take him out
before he gets a chance to testify.

977
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:45,419
It's gonna be tough.
Feds got him 'round the clock.

978
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:49,757
- Need a bazooka.
- Must be a way to flush him out.

979
01:18:49,759 --> 01:18:52,860
Must be some bait
we can set to stop him...

980
01:18:52,862 --> 01:18:56,897
Before he gets
a chance to testify.

981
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:59,166
You got something?

982
01:18:59,168 --> 01:19:02,369
Get the car.
I've got a job for you.

983
01:19:03,773 --> 01:19:06,307
I could not believe it.

984
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:10,411
I step out my front door and there's
this car comin' 100 Miles an hour.

985
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:12,413
We'll have to cancel.

986
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:14,815
Forget it.
You got a good understudy.

987
01:19:14,817 --> 01:19:18,786
You don't understand.
This is a gala opening.

988
01:19:18,788 --> 01:19:21,856
We have the mayor coming.
We have big names.

989
01:19:21,858 --> 01:19:23,924
We can't go with an unknown.

990
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:26,127
Miles pope is
gonna be terrific.

991
01:19:27,897 --> 01:19:30,865
I think he'll surprise you.

992
01:19:32,468 --> 01:19:34,902
Tell him othello's not jealous.

993
01:19:34,904 --> 01:19:38,539
Iago's jealous.
Othello's crazy.

994
01:19:38,541 --> 01:19:42,343
Critics will love it.

995
01:19:42,345 --> 01:19:44,311
I believe that
this kid is for real.

996
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:47,915
You have more gall than is
healthy for an FBI man.

997
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:50,818
You're lucky I'm not busting
you down to the mail room...

998
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:53,154
After the stunt you
pulled with those actors.

999
01:19:53,156 --> 01:19:55,322
If carver was just
another millionaire,

1000
01:19:55,324 --> 01:19:57,825
why would he try to have the lead
in his own play knocked off...

1001
01:19:57,827 --> 01:19:59,827
<i>The day before</i>
<i>the play is to open?</i>

1002
01:19:59,829 --> 01:20:01,495
You have no proof.

1003
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:04,431
Carver believes
we are listening to pope.

1004
01:20:04,433 --> 01:20:06,534
He knows the way to shut
him up is to kill him.

1005
01:20:06,536 --> 01:20:09,370
He knows he has
to flush him out.

1006
01:20:09,372 --> 01:20:11,505
He's trying to get
his guy a clear shot.

1007
01:20:11,507 --> 01:20:15,376
I'm sorry, there's no way
I can authorize this.

1008
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:34,395
I was one of your
best agents for 15 years.

1009
01:20:34,397 --> 01:20:37,531
You trusted my instincts
and I always came through.

1010
01:20:37,533 --> 01:20:39,867
Carver is luchino.
I can feel it!

1011
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:43,003
<i>I'll give you my badge</i>
<i>and my pension...</i>

1012
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:45,606
If I'm wrong, but
I believe this kid.

1013
01:20:45,608 --> 01:20:49,476
I want this chance,

1014
01:20:49,478 --> 01:20:51,579
sir.

1015
01:21:13,903 --> 01:21:16,604
All units, mark's in position.

1016
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:21,041
God, I'm nervous.
Don't worry, I'll be great.

1017
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:23,010
I'm not worried
about your performance.

1018
01:21:23,012 --> 01:21:26,380
There's feds everywhere.
There's nothing to worry about.

1019
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:28,949
Okay, do well.

1020
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:31,986
See you later. I'll
see you later.

1021
01:21:31,988 --> 01:21:34,989
God, I'm nervous. I'll be fine.

1022
01:21:34,991 --> 01:21:37,625
Listen, I know you're
doing Shakespeare.

1023
01:21:37,627 --> 01:21:40,394
There's a right way and a wrong way to do it.
But whatever you do,

1024
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:44,565
just keep moving, don't stay
in the same place too long.

1025
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:46,934
I'll try my best. Okay, yeah.

1026
01:21:46,936 --> 01:21:49,336
I'm nervous. Don't be nervous.

1027
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:51,405
Get out of here.
Let me get that.

1028
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:53,474
Love you, man. Love you.

1029
01:21:53,476 --> 01:21:56,410
God, I'm nervous.

1030
01:21:56,412 --> 01:22:00,948
I discovered him,
plucked him from obscurity.

1031
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:02,983
Taught him everything he knows.
Excuse me.

1032
01:22:02,985 --> 01:22:05,986
That's bullshit.
I discovered him.

1033
01:22:05,988 --> 01:22:08,622
Pay no attention
to this self-publicist.

1034
01:22:08,624 --> 01:22:12,026
I'm Harvey Cooper, Miles' agent.
That's my number.

1035
01:22:14,497 --> 01:22:19,400
Isn't that too typical? They'll
be coming out of the woodwork.

1036
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:34,448
<i>Look where he comes.</i>

1037
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:38,485
I will not leave him now
till cassio be called.

1038
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:43,057
How is it with you, my lord?

1039
01:22:43,059 --> 01:22:45,526
Well, my good lady.

1040
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,567
O, hardness to dissemble.

1041
01:22:53,569 --> 01:22:55,669
<i>How do you, desdemona?</i>
<i>Well, my good lord.</i>

1042
01:22:55,671 --> 01:22:57,972
<i>Give me your hand.</i>

1043
01:22:57,974 --> 01:23:02,443
This hand requires sequester from
liberty, fasting and prayer,

1044
01:23:02,445 --> 01:23:06,447
<i>much castigation,</i>
<i>exercise devout.</i>

1045
01:23:06,449 --> 01:23:10,451
'Twas that hand that gave away my heart.
A liberal hand.

1046
01:23:10,453 --> 01:23:12,720
<i>The hearts of old gave hands,</i>

1047
01:23:12,722 --> 01:23:15,689
<i>but our new heraldry</i>
<i>is hands, not hearts.</i>

1048
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:19,026
<i>- Come now, your promise.</i>
<i>- What promise?</i>

1049
01:23:19,028 --> 01:23:22,529
<i>I have sent to bid</i>
<i>cassio come speak with you.</i>

1050
01:23:22,531 --> 01:23:25,432
Anthony's moving toward
the lobby, center aisle.

1051
01:23:41,751 --> 01:23:45,052
That handkerchief did
an Egyptian to my mother give.

1052
01:23:45,054 --> 01:23:48,022
<i>She was a charmer and could</i>
<i>read the thoughts of people.</i>

1053
01:23:58,801 --> 01:24:01,802
Picked up something that
looked like a gun case.

1054
01:24:01,804 --> 01:24:05,539
<i>He went upstairs.</i> Let's do it.

1055
01:24:09,478 --> 01:24:13,747
<i>I did so and take heed on't.</i>

1056
01:24:13,749 --> 01:24:16,817
<i>Make it a darling</i>
<i>like your precious eye.</i>

1057
01:24:16,819 --> 01:24:20,587
To lose't or give't away were such
perdition as nothing else could match.

1058
01:24:20,589 --> 01:24:23,590
<i>- Is't true?</i>
<i>- Most veritable.</i>

1059
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:26,592
<i>- Look well.</i>
<i>- Would to God I never seen't.</i>

1060
01:24:26,595 --> 01:24:30,631
Why do you speak so rash? Is't lost?
Is't gone? Speak!

1061
01:24:30,633 --> 01:24:35,102
<i>- Say you.</i>
<i>- It's not lost.</i>

1062
01:24:35,104 --> 01:24:39,473
<i>But what an if it were?</i>
<i>I say it is not lost.</i>

1063
01:24:39,475 --> 01:24:42,443
Fetch't, let me see it.

1064
01:24:45,648 --> 01:24:47,648
<i>This is a trick.</i>

1065
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:49,783
Fetch me the handkerchief.
My mind misgives.

1066
01:24:49,785 --> 01:24:53,687
<i>You'll never meet a more sufficient man.
</i> The handkerchief.

1067
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:57,124
The handkerchief. <i>A man that all his
time hath his fortunes on your love,</i>

1068
01:24:57,126 --> 01:24:59,726
shared dangers with you.
The handkerchief.

1069
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:03,430
Gentlemen?

1070
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:06,700
<i>- Tempt heaven.</i>
<i>- The handkerchief.</i>

1071
01:25:06,702 --> 01:25:10,471
By heaven, I would most
gladly have forgot it.

1072
01:25:10,473 --> 01:25:15,876
O, it comes o'er my memory as doth
the raven o'er the infected house.

1073
01:25:15,878 --> 01:25:18,579
<i>He had my handkerchief.</i>

1074
01:25:18,581 --> 01:25:20,681
<i>Ay, what of that?</i>

1075
01:25:20,683 --> 01:25:24,551
That's not so good now.
O, blood,

1076
01:25:24,553 --> 01:25:27,621
blood, blood...

1077
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:30,491
oh, my God, he's been shot!

1078
01:25:33,863 --> 01:25:36,897
Whoa, my blood!

1079
01:25:41,537 --> 01:25:42,836
Oh, my God.

1080
01:25:42,838 --> 01:25:46,473
<i>O God, why does</i>
<i>thou punish me so?</i>

1081
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:50,577
<i>Blood doth pour out</i>
<i>of my open chest.</i>

1082
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:52,713
My boyfriend!

1083
01:25:52,715 --> 01:25:56,517
Would that I could know my assassin
and confront him with his name?

1084
01:25:56,519 --> 01:25:58,585
Which play is this?

1085
01:26:02,558 --> 01:26:04,591
But hark, there he sits.

1086
01:26:04,593 --> 01:26:07,728
<i>Beneath his cloak</i>
<i>of respectability...</i>

1087
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:10,864
Doth a scoundrel lurk.

1088
01:26:10,866 --> 01:26:14,301
O Francis, why does thou
seek to have me slain,

1089
01:26:14,303 --> 01:26:18,539
<i>when a promise made upon the plane
to have your secret here remain,</i>

1090
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:22,609
when now my life's
blood does stain...

1091
01:26:26,649 --> 01:26:29,516
what's he talking about, leland?
I have no idea.

1092
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:32,753
Come on, you do so.

1093
01:26:32,755 --> 01:26:34,821
My pal, Duane,
he rigged the vest.

1094
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:40,894
Why don't you stay dead?

1095
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:44,565
Sorry, this is one spook
that just won't stay whacked.

1096
01:26:44,567 --> 01:26:46,600
Capisci?

1097
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:52,906
It's all over, Frank.

1098
01:26:52,908 --> 01:26:55,976
<i>I've waited 11 years for this.</i>

1099
01:26:55,978 --> 01:26:58,979
Frank luchino, you're under arrest.
Yeah!

1100
01:26:58,981 --> 01:27:01,915
This is ridiculous. I don't
know what you're talking about.

1101
01:27:01,917 --> 01:27:04,384
My name is leland carver.

1102
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:07,554
Great story. Why don't
you keep telling it?

1103
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:10,591
It was carver!

1104
01:27:13,662 --> 01:27:17,631
Leland, you're Frank luchino?

1105
01:27:18,767 --> 01:27:21,902
No wonder we never paid for
anything in Las Vegas.

1106
01:27:22,871 --> 01:27:25,672
Put cuffs on him.

1107
01:27:31,313 --> 01:27:33,614
Oh, by the way.

1108
01:27:33,616 --> 01:27:35,682
<i>When you get to the joint,</i>

1109
01:27:35,684 --> 01:27:37,684
talk to some of the brothers.

1110
01:27:37,686 --> 01:27:40,754
They'll be dying to hear your
views on racial equality.

1111
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:43,790
Get him outta here! Yeah!

1112
01:27:43,792 --> 01:27:45,892
No matter how many
times I see Shakespeare,

1113
01:27:45,894 --> 01:27:47,961
I always get
something new out of it.

1114
01:27:47,963 --> 01:27:51,898
Bravo! Bravo, Miles!

1115
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:01,775
If he doesn't get here,
if he messes this up...

1116
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:04,411
he ain't gonna mess it up.
He'll get here.

1117
01:28:04,413 --> 01:28:07,814
He'll get here. All right.

1118
01:28:10,886 --> 01:28:14,421
Miles! Miles!

1119
01:28:14,423 --> 01:28:16,657
<i>Where the hell have you been?</i>

1120
01:28:16,659 --> 01:28:19,960
I'm sorry. I got held up.
I met this girl.

1121
01:28:22,431 --> 01:28:25,799
- Miles, she's perfect.
- Save it, man.

1122
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:28,869
- I got your tickets.
- Thanks, man.

1123
01:28:28,871 --> 01:28:32,973
I always come through,
even if it is late.

1124
01:28:32,975 --> 01:28:35,342
Come here. Okay.

1125
01:28:35,344 --> 01:28:38,879
Thanks for everything. Have a good one.
I gotta go.

1126
01:28:38,881 --> 01:28:42,683
- You're under arrest, huh?
- Yeah, I'm under arrest.

1127
01:28:42,685 --> 01:28:44,651
Make sure you get
that one phone call.

1128
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:51,692
Watch that choke hold. Stop.

1129
01:28:51,694 --> 01:28:53,860
Well, she might.

1130
01:28:53,862 --> 01:28:57,831
<i>May I help you?</i>

1131
01:29:02,805 --> 01:29:06,473
Atlantic northern? Isn't
this the airline you took...

1132
01:29:06,475 --> 01:29:09,042
this flight is overbooked.

1133
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:13,680
I thought we'd bump
you to first class.

1134
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:15,749
How does that sound?

1135
01:29:22,391 --> 01:29:24,491
I gotta tell you, kristi.

1136
01:29:24,493 --> 01:29:28,028
I've learned some important
lessons from all this stuff.

1137
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:30,931
You have? Uh-huh.

1138
01:29:30,933 --> 01:29:35,736
Like there's black,
there's white...

1139
01:29:35,738 --> 01:29:39,773
And there's meaningful
shades of gray.

1140
01:29:39,775 --> 01:29:42,042
Other thing is...

1141
01:29:42,044 --> 01:29:44,911
First class sucks.

1142
01:29:44,913 --> 01:29:48,448
First class really sucks.

1143
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:50,517
I think you know what
I'm talking about.

1144
01:29:50,519 --> 01:29:52,486
Come here, girl. I think I do.

1145
01:29:52,488 --> 01:29:54,755
You know I love you. Mm-mm.
