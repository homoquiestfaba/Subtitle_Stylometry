anything legit about that place?

And it doesn't matter, OK?

345
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,643
I didn't make a point of it earlier
because I wanted you to know that...

346
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,412
I'm fine with it.

347
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:39,952
I'm fine with you being...
whatever it is you wanna be.

348

I let go of a lot of
bad things in my life.

Sorry, bud. I was in

I was looking for.

Turns out we'd fallen in love
with an idea, not each other.

home and I'd already said goodbye.

trying to call your boyfriend.

by me. Just a hunch is all.

Good for you.

480
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:13,306
So, are you into girls?
Is that how you can tell?

481
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,873
Now, why would you think that?
Is it cos I carry a gun?

482
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:20,043
- Cos I bust dudes' asses for a day job?
- Women commit crimes too.

483
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:23,313
Is it cos I look in a rear-view
mirror or a side-view mirror

484
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,681
more than a compact mirror?

485
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:27,751
Perish the thought. Don't make
it out like it's such a bad thing.

486

- What?
- Being attracted to the same sex.

00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:33,625

like it's a bad thing not to be!

Sorry. That was out of line.

492
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,087
I had a thing with a girl once.

493
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:58,320
She was Latina.

494
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:01,061
Her name was Carmen.

495
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:06,227
Didn't feel anything, though.
No chemistry. That's how I knew.

496
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:13,230
And here I am, thinking the tough cookie
had a chocolate chip on her shoulder.

497
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:18,035

So, what's your deal, buddy?

515
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:39,951
It's like there's just something
about you you're not telling us.

516
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:43,920
- Trust me, it takes one to know one.
- You don't have to tell him anything.

00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,223
It's fine.

518
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:50,762
I should get used to it.
To explaining, I guess.

519
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:56,967
A few years ago I decided to get lost,
so that when I found myself,

520
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,641
I'd know where and who I was.

521
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,973
I thought it was this rebellious act,

522
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,215
but I kind of learned that it
didn't really change anything.

523
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:11,314
I can't escape the person
who's inside of me,

524
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:14,294
and I'm kind of learning
to love that person.

525
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:18,321

- EARLENE: Yeah.

BILLY: Sure.

527
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:37,174
My mother produced two eggs.

528
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:41,247
XY for a boy and XX for a girl.

529
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:45,248
Now, normally this
would create twins.

530
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:50,629
But the eggs merged and
a chimera was formed.

531
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:57,702
A boy was born with a uterus,
an ovary and a fallopian tube.

532
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:03,005
A boy whose parents
were fucking terrified.

533
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:11,113
A boy who never saw his sister,
but can always feel her spirit.

534
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:27,828
Can't you just have them removed?
