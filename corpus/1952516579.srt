1
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,284
Clear! Clear the frame!

2
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:03,205
Lila! Cut! Cut! Lila!

3
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,091
Bela, what is it?
There's no one in frame.

4
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,511
Something is in here.

5
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,139
I saw it.

6
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,895
Bela. Bela, what is it?

7
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:34,797
Yeah.

8
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,174
Uh, hold up.

9
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,389
"Olt sees the Mulli. "

10
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,891
God, this is good.

11
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,607
What's up?

12
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,359
On my way.

13
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,721
Sorry to call, Marcus.

14
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,975
You're supposed to let
the doctors know

15
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,936
when your temperature
gets like this, Claire.

16
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,105
You know that.

17
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,526
Chemo could send you
into septic shock.

18
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:42,406
I hate that.
It sounds like a human toilet.

19
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,284
You weren't sleeping, were you?

20
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,498
It's still haunting you.

21
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,251
I should be there with you.

22
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,128
No.

23
00:04:56,254 --> 00:05:00,257
Claire, you can't be there.
It's impossible.

24
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,348
Somebody's gonna be happy
to see me.

25
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,027
What are you doin' here?

26
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,946
I'll call you when I land.

27
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,327
Guilt, right?

28
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,496
You had your chance,
and you blew it.

29
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,416
Or your life's just too much
to deal with, huh, Marcus?

30
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,211
Stick with runnin' away.
You do that just fine.

31
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,754
Don't listen, Marcus.

32
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,297
You can mess
with my sister's head

33
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,132
and bullshit people
about your visions

34
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,592
or whatever they are,

35
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,804
but you're not special,
you're just sick.

36
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,098
There ain't gonna be
any comeback for you, Marcus,

37
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,224
this time or any time.

38
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,934
Marcus, just go.

39
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,560
Run away, Marcus!

40
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,063
Romania or wherever the hell
you're goin' this time.

41
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,731
But do not come here
when you get back

42
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,900
'cause I'm changing addresses,
you got it?

43
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,737
Marcus, just tell him.
It's my fault.

44
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,656
Claire, stop it.

45
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,952
No, you don't have to defend me
and take the blame.

46
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,413
I was the one who gave up on us.

47
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,249
Claire!

48
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,001
Just leave it.

49
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,984
You better get used to it.

50
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,238
Some directors are self-delusional.
Marcus is just delusional, period.

51
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,994
Hey, Marcus.

52
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,081
Yo. Wake up.

53
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,882
Huh? Where are we?

54
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:52,596
Oh, roughly about 6,000 bucks
over budget in your line item.

55
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,348
Geographically, Josh.

56
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,476
We are in "villoge" soon, Mr. Marcus.

57
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,728
Village, Grigore. Village.

58
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,775
Grigore, please, call me Marcus.

59
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,485
I'm not sure he wants
to call you anything

60
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,698
after your little schizotypal display.

61
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,074
Josh, you ever consider

62
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,203
maybe I really do have
apparitional experiences?

63
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,579
No.

64
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,077
Welcome.

65
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,581
Is famous. Man who become
rich making Kashkaval.

66
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:04,293
Famous Romanian cheese, he build.

67
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,213
Well, this is it.

68
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,176
I'm banking on that
demented mind of yours,

69
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,345
so, don't screw this up.

70
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,929
I can't.

71
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,432
I'm doing it for Claire.

72
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,147
And it's... it's none
of my business, but, uh...

73
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:29,234
She did leave you
before she got ill.

74
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,528
Maybe you should just
let all that go. Yeah?

75
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,072
Mr. Petri?

76
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,115
Mr. Petri? Do I take it in?

77
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,326
Just leave it.
Take Marcus to the stage.

78
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,828
Now? But is dark.

79
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,663
Let's go take a look at the sets.

80
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,292
It's not good time
to go now, Mr. Marcus.

81
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,762
Ugh. Geez.

82
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,265
Is no good place, this place.

83
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,851
Why do you want
to come here, Mr. Marcus?

84
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,813
I wanna shoot in the same studio
as Bela Olt's original film.

85
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,106
Why?

86
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,900
Well, a long time ago,

87
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,445
I came across a production still
of the old movie...

88
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,282
the only production still
as far as I know.

89
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,410
It stuck with me...

90
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:22,538
the mood, the look.

91
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,082
This movie is never finished.

92
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,085
And no one ever see it, Mr. Marcus.

93
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,629
Is bad luck for these people.

94
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,590
Is bad luck here, for you, too.

95
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,011
What do you mean?

96
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,184
Mr. Marcus, I tell Mr. Petri
we must stay in Bucharest.

97
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,353
No film crew come here anymore.

98
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,024
It's late now. We go back, yes?

99
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,025
No.

100
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,570
Somebody's gotta be here.

101
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,364
The art department never sleeps.

102
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,542
Mr. Marcus!

103
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,212
Mr. Marcus! Someone is here!

104
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,216
There was man at gate.

105
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,678
Maybe the gatekeeper?

106
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,118
You see? Crew's sleeping now.

107
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,955
No one is here, Mr. Marcus.

108
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,794
Set, it is good, no?

109
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,964
You like?

110
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:56,965
Sweet.

111
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,343
Is almost finished.

112
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,179
We go back now, yes?

113
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,662
Hey, what is it, Mr. Marcus?

114
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,455
What is wrong?

115
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,457
Something.

116
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,126
Please, Mr. Marcus.

117
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:36,964
Where you go, Mr. Marcus?
What is it?

118
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,027
Mr. Marcus.

119
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,904
Mr. Marcus!

120
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,960
Don't smell good.

121
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,380
Check that side.

122
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,686
Grigore!

123
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,024
Mr. Marcus?

124
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:12,661
Mr. Marcus, I am not feeling well.

125
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,164
I- I think...

126
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,506
TAMl: All right, people.
Let's settle.

127
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,723
Mag jam.

128
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:24,483
Oh! Whoa!

129
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:27,569
Cut!

130
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,822
Cut.

131
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,323
TAMl: Okay, that's a cut!

132
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,866
Everybody back to one
and we'll do it again.

133
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,035
- Dude.
- What? What is it?

134
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:41,750
Sorry, the, uh, film was, uh,
I don't know, jamming or some...

135
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,460
I... I just saw...

136
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,883
Davis? Juice?

137
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,885
TAMl: Can we get some lights on
down here, please?

138
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,762
Okay.

139
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,266
Davis!

140
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,059
I'm right here.

141
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,269
Eddie!

142
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,187
Yo!

143
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,358
Same deal. Keeps kickin' off.

144
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,652
- What does it mean?
- I don't know what to tell you.

145
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,155
There's some drain on the power
comin' into this place or something.

146
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,906
How much time, Davis?

147
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,283
TAMl: Where is she going?

148
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,326
Can we please
get somebody up there

149
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,870
who knows what the hell he's doing?

150
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:25,085
Davis, you gonna be able to fix this?

151
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:30,090
You want steady current,
you get locations to figure it out.

152
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,968
He's the genius
who booked us into this toilet.

153
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:36,305
Mr. Davis,
is old here, yes.

154
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,474
But please do not say toilet.

155
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,061
Studio is historic, very historic.

156
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,022
What are you, a booster
for the Romanian Rotary Club?

157
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,901
This dump was wired at the dawn
of the electric light bulb.

158
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,445
Well, short of bringing in
a new Jenny from Bucharest,

159
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,113
which I can't afford to do,

160
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,157
what would you like me to do
to help you out?

161
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,493
What, like rewire the whole joint?

162
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,703
We already been up
in that stinkin' hotbox,

163
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,830
pre-riggin' this place
till we're both sick,

164
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:02,956
pukin' our guts out.

165
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,875
I'm sorry
we took this gig, Petri.

166
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,086
Your pay sucks, we're three
wrong turns from nowhere,

167
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,046
and Frankenstein's
manservant here

168
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:13,050
has got us lodging
in an abandoned shithole

169
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,928
that wouldn't pass
for a crack whore's flop house.

170
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,390
You don't want to move,
you don't wanna spend money...

171
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,603
Deal with what
we're dealing with here.

172
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,522
Okay.

173
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:27,648
Okay, well thanks

174
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,735
for your professional
technical opinion, Davis.

175
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:35,864
Igor... this is who you mean?

176
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,949
What?

177
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,868
Frankenstein... his assistant.

178
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,995
His name... it is Igor.

179
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,957
I am Grigore, not Igor.

180
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:50,004
Actually, his name... it is Fritz
in first two movies.

181
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,506
Then it become Igor.

182
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,095
Keep this guy
away from me, please.

183
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:01,640
Also he is Swiss, not Romanian.

184
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,059
Let's give these dipshits
a reminder of who's upstairs

185
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:06,603
with their hand on a plug.

186
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,149
You can't really say

187
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,068
our film's a remake
of Bela Olt's lost movie,

188
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,404
because nobody's ever seen
his version.

189
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:20,117
I was inspired by the same
Gypsy folktale he tried to adapt.

190
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:23,412
He never finished his film,
it seemed, so...

191
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:26,874
I thought, you know,
maybe somebody should.

192
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:31,128
Well, why don't you talk a little
about the original story,

193
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,963
the old legend?

194
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,050
Well, it's like a lot of Gypsy stories
about the Devil.

195
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:39,178
It starts with a beautiful
young Gypsy girl, Chavi...

196
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:42,181
a singer, a dancer.

197
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,142
She wants more than anything
not to be an outcast,

198
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,312
so she begs Beng,
the Gypsy devil,

199
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,898
to give her the most
powerful husband in the land

200
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,192
so she can escape
the hardship of her life.

201
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,402
And Beng agrees, of course.

202
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,697
Yeah, but like most deals
with the Devil, there's a price.

203
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:02,576
And in this case, he wants
Chavi's firstborn daughter

204
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:06,038
to take as his consort
to mother his evil offspring.

205
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,998
So, a pact is made.

206
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,877
Beng puts the powerful lord
under Chavi's spell.

207
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:14,338
From that doomed union,
a child is born...

208
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,257
Matya...

209
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,927
hidden away in a garret

210
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,514
until it's time to be
the bride of Beng.

211
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,268
Hey man,
just shut it down, all right?

212
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,812
There's no steady current.

213
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:33,148
Unplug all the cables
going into the distribution box,

214
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:36,402
and we'll reconnect everything again.

215
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,413
Davis, can we get
some house lights?

216
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,040
Checking!

217
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,374
Hey, I'm on it!

218
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:40,591
Whoa!

219
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,318
Oh, my God!

220
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,281
Eddie?!

221
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,253
It's three hours
to Bucharest.

222
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,464
Not to worry,
I bring you to hospital.

223
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,008
I can't believe this.

224
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:41,819
Grigore, you said something
about this place

225
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:44,571
the night we arrived,
about Olt's crew having bad luck.

226
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,907
Is Mulli's revenge.

227
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:51,286
They say she killed them all...
all the crew... like legend.

228
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:52,454
What?

229
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:54,540
No one talk about it, Mr. Marcus.

230
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:55,958
I go to Bucharest now.

231
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:59,670
Next village have nothing,
no one who can help.

232
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,674
Uh, hold up, hold up!

233
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,344
Take this with you.

234
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,930
What, you want him
to do a lab run?

235
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,475
We're supposed to shut down?
It's bad enough we lost a day.

236
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:17,938
Grigore, go to the emergency room
first, then the lab. Is that okay?

237
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,234
A little cavalier, maybe.

238
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,821
TAMl: All right, guys, show's over.
Everybody get back inside.

239
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:29,033
You saw those guys.
My ass is on the line here.

240
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,161
I heard they felt sick
from being up in the fly gallery.

241
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,496
I was up there with Grigore.
He got sick.

242
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:36,498
They were screwing around
up there,

243
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,042
and they're trying to screw us.

244
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:42,212
Look, Josh,
something doesn't feel right.

245
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:45,883
No, stop right there.

246
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,766
Do you remember the last time
something didn't feel right,

247
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:56,310
and you felt all funny
about that house in Maine?

248
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:57,561
You wouldn't go inside

249
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,188
and they had to shut
the production down

250
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:01,148
'cause they couldn't
reschedule the actors

251
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:04,443
or extend the deals
with the crew or the equipment.

252
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:06,195
Is that all coming back to you now?

253
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:09,198
'Cause that marked your descent
from first film "wunderkind"

254
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:12,618
to second film "who gives a shit. "

255
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:16,747
Look, I'm here. I'm doing it.

256
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,916
Okay, don't get me wrong,

257
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:22,127
because I want you to keep
conjuring up all this weird shit

258
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,296
that's in your head
and putting it on film,

259
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,758
but I want you to remember
that it's just in your head.

260
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:32,096
You've never actually seen
or touched or spoken

261
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:36,141
to any of these apparitions,
have you?

262
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:42,398
Right.

263
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:48,153
See, because you just
hallucinate them very, very vividly

264
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,573
in these little episodes,
or whatever they are.

265
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,033
And you're very, very lucky

266
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,577
because this is the one business,
the film business,

267
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:57,830
where being
a complete and total nut job

268
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:00,457
actually has economic benefits.

269
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:04,128
So let's not piss
in the punch here, okay?

270
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:06,380
Stay focused.

271
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:09,967
And I may not be an expert
in psychopharmacology,

272
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:13,804
but I do know when it's time
for you to take your medications.

273
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:24,815
Hey. And let's get us
back on track... tomorrow!

274
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:27,192
Back on schedule!

275
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,585
Excuse me, sir?

276
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:12,589
Sorry. Do you speak English?

277
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:18,053
Uh, you work here?

278
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:19,972
What you want?

279
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:23,517
Uh, a maintenance person, I guess.

280
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:29,064
There's an odor in the fly gallery.
It's making people sick.

281
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:32,693
Dead rats, maybe.

282
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:34,194
Do you poison them?

283
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:37,573
No one working here many years.

284
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:39,700
No one.

285
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,660
What do you do, then?

286
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,954
I am waiting.

287
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,333
I am waiting long time.

288
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:50,961
For what?

289
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:58,927
For someone like you
to make film again here, of course.

290
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:39,802
Cut!

291
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,637
All right, that's a cut.

292
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,722
Camera moved, everybody.

293
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:46,725
Can we get
all hands on deck, please?

294
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:50,896
We used a stand-in.
Can you bring Romy back?

295
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:51,980
Yeah.

296
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:54,942
Let's get Romy touched up.
Last looks, please.

297
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,443
Make sure the Chavi
costume doubles

298
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,987
are standing by
for the Matya birthing scene.

299
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:01,115
I'm not gettin' enough spill
from those overheads.

300
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,867
You need to get her in closer
to the edge of the grid, understand?

301
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,495
Dude, she is into you.

302
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:11,208
I'm zeroing in on another target.

303
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:14,044
Crina, assistant wardrobe.

304
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:20,217
How do you say,
"What can I do to get you

305
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:24,138
to make all my sexual desires
come true," in Romanian?

306
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:28,559
I think that'd be, "green card. "

307
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:32,438
Dude, that might actually work!

308
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,254
Hey, Mr. Marcus.
- Good night.

309
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,548
See you tomorrow.

310
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:51,243
What? What's going on?

311
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:17,144
Looks like footage
from '20s... '30s perhaps.

312
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:23,108
Possibly the lab is restoring it,
got it mixed up with yours.

313
00:32:23,234 --> 00:32:26,070
Mnh-mnh. The images
look composited,

314
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:28,906
like it was done in camera,

315
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:32,993
like the film stock was previously
exposed, or something.

316
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,205
Heard of shooting short ends
to save money,

317
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:41,210
but not 80-year-old short ends.

318
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:46,590
That film stock's brand new.
I'm not that cheap, for Christ's sake.

319
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:51,303
Guys, that's Lila Kis playing Chavi.

320
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:53,514
This is Bella Olt's film...

321
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:55,933
the original film.

322
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,893
It's been lost for 80 years,

323
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:01,230
but suddenly, there's
a piece of it in our dailies.

324
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:03,732
Look, whatever it is,

325
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:07,611
it's a lab screw up and nothing
more pretentious than that.

326
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:09,780
Wadim, transmit the footage to L.A.,

327
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,865
and send them an e-mail
and give them a heads up

328
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:15,244
so they don't think Marcus
has gone flaky on them.

329
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:18,330
We should cut this anyway.
It never went anywhere.

330
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,792
It's the only shot that actually
has a reference to Olt's movie.

331
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,168
It means something.

332
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:28,090
Look, neither you, nor anybody else
knows what this scene means

333
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:31,260
taken out of context from a film
that no one's ever seen.

334
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:34,638
Anybody under 100
who's off resuscitation

335
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:37,599
won't even get that it's a reference
to Olt's lost movie.

336
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:40,310
Just cut it, like I said.

337
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:47,818
I'll call the lab on this.
We'll get another print of the neg.

338
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:49,611
They can have it here tomorrow.

339
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:53,073
None of these should be on there.
You should be all right.

340
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:59,663
Look, man. I don't wanna sound

341
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:03,751
like some psycho Hollywood
scientologist or something,

342
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,419
but whatever caused that shot...

343
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:08,922
it ain't got nothing to do
with the mag jamming, like I said.

344
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:11,550
It's some freak thing, man.
It's like...

345
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:14,928
It's like one time I actually had
a hand, right, a palm,

346
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:17,681
show up
in the middle of a shot.

347
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:21,101
Exterior wide of a field, right?
Daytime... nobody in it.

348
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:23,687
And then this freakin' palm
shows up, out of nowhere,

349
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:26,857
right in the middle of the frame
when we print.

350
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:29,360
It's a warning.

351
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:31,153
What do you mean?
What do you mean? Like...

352
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:33,906
Like... halt?

353
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:35,783
Slow for seniors?

354
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,953
You ever hear
of residual haunting?

355
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,580
Uh, nope.

356
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:46,502
But if it's anything like
a residuals check, it doesn't exist.

357
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:52,091
Think of it like a photo imprint
from the past.

358
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,551
Traumatic events release energy.

359
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:58,472
That energy gets stored
into materials like film or tape.

360
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:02,476
Stone, metal, slate.
They all absorb emotional imprints.

361
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:06,772
There are even people
who do... supposedly.

362
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:10,401
So, you...

363
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:13,362
Sorry, I just gotta...
I gotta get this processed.

364
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:15,030
Uh, you think that, um...

365
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:19,493
that, uh, emotional events
from the past

366
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,453
are on automatic rewind
all around us,

367
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,831
and we filmed one.

368
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:26,792
Dude, that's retarded.

369
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:30,421
I'm sorry.
You can't really believe that.

370
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:33,966
Not unless you also believe
in fairy tales,

371
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:37,136
like, uh, I don't know...

372
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:39,722
like, net profits.

373
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:41,098
I believe it.

374
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:43,726
I believe it, 'cause it's better
than the alternative.

375
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:45,561
And what's that?

376
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:47,980
That it's not just
the harmless imprint

377
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:50,107
of somebody's misery
from long ago,

378
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:52,776
but something
that can come through here,

379
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:54,987
into the present.

380
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:58,907
You're a head case, dude. For real.

381
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:02,369
Exceeding all my expectations,
awesome.

382
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:04,413
Excellent.

383
00:38:23,762 --> 00:38:25,429
Are you all right?

384
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:29,558
You were shouting.

385
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:32,478
Could you come in?

386
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:38,317
They say I've got a disorder.

387
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:44,239
I exhibit eccentric behavior
and unconventional ideas.

388
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:52,206
And I have an unfounded belief
that I have extrasensory abilities.

389
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:54,792
That could apply to every member
of the Director's Guild...

390
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:58,003
I know... by the way.

391
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:02,758
You see things?

392
00:39:02,884 --> 00:39:04,301
Such as?

393
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:13,686
Let's say someone died
under emotional circumstances.

394
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:18,232
My subconscious kind of pieces
the event back together.

395
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:23,779
I see it, hear it, feel it...

396
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:26,031
like I'm there.

397
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,995
And here...

398
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:34,498
what do you see here?

399
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,917
Do you feel threatened
by something?

400
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:40,212
No, these things
never breach our world.

401
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:41,922
They never touch us.

402
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:43,424
Now, they may be anguished

403
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,885
and run us out of a house
by their presence.

404
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:52,766
Or they may just always wanna be
there for us, to watch over us,

405
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:56,437
to make amends
for some past mistake.

406
00:39:57,313 --> 00:40:01,191
No... no danger.

407
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:06,947
Just, there are times...

408
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:12,286
when I see things
I really don't wanna see.

409
00:40:45,236 --> 00:40:47,237
I want you to know something.

410
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:52,743
I saw you interviewed
on the DVD of your film.

411
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:57,706
You seemed strong, powerful.

412
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:02,378
I wanted to work with you,
to meet you.

413
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:05,964
I thought it would change my life.

414
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:59,518
Claire? You there?

415
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,605
Hope you're not changing
the address, like Garret said.

416
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:07,776
Look. I know this is
why you broke up with me.

417
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:10,029
But I need to talk to you.

418
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:13,741
I'm having them again. Strong ones.
A lot, but different.

419
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:16,660
There's, like,
not just visions, but...

420
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:18,996
I'm a part of what I'm seeing.

421
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:23,208
I'm worried... about everyone.

422
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:25,127
Fight!

423
00:42:25,253 --> 00:42:26,879
Yeah, I'll call you right back.

424
00:42:30,216 --> 00:42:32,092
Hey! Hey, you guys, stop!

425
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:41,769
Hey!

426
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:43,479
Aah!

427
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:50,569
- Where'd you get that?
- You pull a weapon on my set?

428
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:58,243
Look, something's wrong here.

429
00:42:58,453 --> 00:43:00,287
Nobody pulls a weapon on my set!

430
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:01,747
You're gone, man.

431
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,834
They know.

432
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,295
They know what's goin' on!

433
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:10,130
I heard about you, Reed.

434
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,342
I had friends on that show
you shut down in Maine.

435
00:43:13,551 --> 00:43:15,302
You're wacked, man!
You're mental as hell!

436
00:43:15,428 --> 00:43:17,221
You're the one
bringing this shit out!

437
00:43:17,347 --> 00:43:18,597
Hey, you shut up, Davis!

438
00:43:18,723 --> 00:43:20,224
You don't know
what you're talkin' about!

439
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:23,268
Did you see
what happened to Eddie?

440
00:43:25,897 --> 00:43:27,690
You know, what are you doin'
this for, man, huh?

441
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:30,609
For this? For a movie?
I'm gonna shut your ass down!

442
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:32,611
Okay, you've lost your mind!

443
00:43:32,737 --> 00:43:35,948
Now you get outta here!
I mean it! Get off my set!

444
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:37,324
You go see the office.

445
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,119
They'll pay you
and arrange your flight home.

446
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:42,204
Now get out of here! Go!

447
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:48,627
What the hell is everybody
standin' around here for, huh?

448
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:51,171
Get back to work. Come on.

449
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:55,009
This is over. Let's make
some filmed entertainment.

450
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:57,720
Everybody, go on. Back to work.

451
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:04,810
Anca, that does not make
the B-roll. I want that take.

452
00:44:04,936 --> 00:44:09,064
Okay, whatever you say,
Josh. As always.

453
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:11,942
TAMl: Yeah, can one of my A.D.s...
if anyone's on walkie...

454
00:44:12,068 --> 00:44:12,901
go to the office

455
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:15,029
and let production services
and pre-dress know

456
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:17,656
that we're two guys down
and we need help?

457
00:44:17,782 --> 00:44:19,408
Hello?

458
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:22,202
Ugh.

459
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:30,002
You okay?

460
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:30,878
Thanks.

461
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:33,047
Tami, I wanna add a pickup
for today.

462
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:34,548
What pickup?

463
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:37,676
The scene from day one...
I wanna reshoot it.

464
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:40,763
I don't know, Marcus.
We're already pretty tight.

465
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:44,975
- Josh.
- What's up?

466
00:44:45,101 --> 00:44:49,188
He wants to reshoot the scene
from yesterday. You know.

467
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:50,731
I told you to cut that.

468
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:54,526
Anyway, Peter tells me
Wadim's ordered a reprint, so...

469
00:44:54,694 --> 00:44:56,945
let's check and see
if the new print's clean or not

470
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:58,447
before we talk about reshoots.

471
00:44:59,115 --> 00:45:03,118
No, I want to shoot it different,
from up there.

472
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:06,455
She's looking up in the original.
She's looking right in the camera.

473
00:45:06,664 --> 00:45:08,374
You want me to move
the camera up there?

474
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:09,541
No, Peter, hold up.

475
00:45:09,668 --> 00:45:12,294
Look, you want me to be
inspired by things, right?

476
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,005
So I'm telling you I'm feeling
something about this shot

477
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:18,342
and I wanna put that on screen,
okay, Josh?

478
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:20,344
Okay.

479
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:22,429
Something good? Something weird?
The money shot?

480
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:25,099
Let's move the freakin' camera,
people.

481
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:29,103
Get him off!

482
00:45:29,312 --> 00:45:32,147
Listen to me!

483
00:45:32,273 --> 00:45:34,149
Everybody!

484
00:45:37,278 --> 00:45:41,281
They're not tellin' you the truth.

485
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:46,829
This guy... this guy's psychic.

486
00:45:47,038 --> 00:45:51,875
He's attracted to places like this
where bad shit happens.

487
00:45:53,837 --> 00:45:57,297
That's why nobody's worked here
for 80 years!

488
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:02,636
Oh, my God!

489
00:46:02,762 --> 00:46:05,014
Get a medic! Call a medic!

490
00:46:05,223 --> 00:46:07,766
TAMl: We need a medic onset!
Medic!

491
00:46:07,934 --> 00:46:09,101
Where's the Medic?

492
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:12,396
TAMl: Where's the medic?

493
00:46:12,522 --> 00:46:13,313
Oh, God!

494
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,360
Hey!

495
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:23,115
Marcus!

496
00:46:25,744 --> 00:46:29,705
Marcus!

497
00:46:29,914 --> 00:46:32,041
Marcus, get back down from there!
Come on!

498
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,209
Come down!

499
00:46:40,175 --> 00:46:42,926
Just maybe, somebody,
some young girl like Matya

500
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:46,055
really existed at one point,
and bad things happened to her.

501
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:48,182
If so, she was
a victim of superstition

502
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:49,558
because of this caul thing,

503
00:46:49,684 --> 00:46:51,894
not because of some deal
with the Devil.

504
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,229
That's folktale nonsense.

505
00:46:59,986 --> 00:47:02,696
You told me
you could control yourself.

506
00:47:03,865 --> 00:47:07,951
You call jousting at curtains
with a scimitar control?

507
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:09,161
I can't do this.

508
00:47:09,287 --> 00:47:11,288
No. Hold on.

509
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:17,169
You said places like this
were rich in sensation for you.

510
00:47:17,295 --> 00:47:19,755
Inspirational, you said.

511
00:47:19,881 --> 00:47:22,466
You wanted this job, you needed it.
It was a second chance.

512
00:47:22,592 --> 00:47:23,842
Those are your words.

513
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,427
You're willing to step back

514
00:47:25,553 --> 00:47:27,846
into whatever psychopathic
nightmare you live in

515
00:47:27,972 --> 00:47:29,765
in order to create
another scary movie...

516
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:32,685
a commercially scary movie,
like your first movie.

517
00:47:32,852 --> 00:47:35,354
And I put the money together
based on that agreement.

518
00:47:35,563 --> 00:47:36,897
There's something on the stage.

519
00:47:37,107 --> 00:47:38,482
Listen to me.

520
00:47:38,608 --> 00:47:41,944
You have weird dreams.
And you are a freak, yes.

521
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:43,862
But you are not
Haley Joel Osment.

522
00:47:45,031 --> 00:47:46,782
People probably died here.

523
00:47:46,908 --> 00:47:49,118
Yeah, people have died everywhere.

524
00:47:49,244 --> 00:47:50,786
A guy died in the co-op I bought.

525
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:52,454
Does that mean
he's gonna come in one morning

526
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:53,872
when I'm on the crapper
casting a bronze

527
00:47:53,998 --> 00:47:56,083
and drop a weight
on my head? Does it?

528
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:57,710
I have a responsibility.

529
00:47:57,836 --> 00:48:00,587
Yeah, to the investors!

530
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:11,265
Look. I know you've been
through a lot...

531
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:15,728
with the other movie...
and with Claire...

532
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:18,897
with your... your condition.

533
00:48:20,358 --> 00:48:24,528
I- I'm just askin' you
to keep it together, please.

534
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:28,240
Please, I'm beggin' you.

535
00:48:28,366 --> 00:48:29,867
This is my baby.

536
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:37,583
It's all up here, Marcus.

537
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:39,710
It's not out there.

538
00:48:53,516 --> 00:48:55,851
Find the location.

539
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:35,224
Ah, Mr. Davis,
is good location for you.

540
00:49:57,372 --> 00:49:59,498
Mr. Davis?

541
00:50:56,765 --> 00:50:58,390
Help!

542
00:50:58,516 --> 00:51:01,185
Hello?

543
00:51:01,394 --> 00:51:03,103
Help!

544
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:11,820
Hello?!

545
00:51:13,323 --> 00:51:15,157
Help!

546
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:16,742
Help!

547
00:51:16,868 --> 00:51:17,659
Hello?!

548
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,375
Help!

549
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:28,045
Open the door!

550
00:51:49,025 --> 00:51:52,486
We want to be paid!
This film is finished!

551
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:54,113
The film is not finished.

552
00:51:54,322 --> 00:51:57,157
What happened on this other film
Davis talk about?

553
00:51:57,283 --> 00:51:58,992
We want to know!

554
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,495
Okay, okay.

555
00:52:01,621 --> 00:52:03,455
I wanna tell you everything.

556
00:52:03,581 --> 00:52:06,166
And I can assure you
that once you hear it,

557
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:09,253
you'll be in complete sympathy
with Marcus, and you'll wanna help...

558
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:15,968
Okay. Okay, okay. Listen.

559
00:52:16,094 --> 00:52:18,470
The first thing I wanna say is,

560
00:52:18,596 --> 00:52:22,391
everyone who stays on
will get a bump in their pay.

561
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,600
No.

562
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:24,685
No.

563
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:30,816
Okay.

564
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:40,284
Wadim?

565
00:52:41,327 --> 00:52:43,829
Wadim?

566
00:52:43,955 --> 00:52:45,330
You get the print?

567
00:53:34,255 --> 00:53:35,631
Peter!

568
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:36,674
- Shit!
- What?

569
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,593
Tami, you snuck up on me.

570
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:41,804
Sorry, I was just looking for Wadim.

571
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:43,847
Um, Josh is asking
about the new dailies print.

572
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:46,350
Just saw it. Nothin' on it.

573
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,560
None of that schmutz is on the neg?

574
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:51,105
Well, you want my opinion?

575
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,356
Ask for a new print.

576
00:53:53,608 --> 00:53:57,820
Because, this one ends
right where the problem is.

577
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:02,449
It's like the lab didn't want us
to see it, or something.

578
00:54:02,575 --> 00:54:05,160
So, uh, okay. I'll be sure to him.

579
00:54:05,912 --> 00:54:09,123
He loves paranoid overreactions
to possible slights and conspiracies.

580
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:12,292
- Hey, Tami?
- What?

581
00:54:12,919 --> 00:54:17,089
Listen. All this shit that's
going down about Marcus...

582
00:54:17,215 --> 00:54:19,299
Straight up, okay,
I heard about him, too.

583
00:54:19,509 --> 00:54:24,304
And I heard that Josh paid
some people off on that show

584
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:26,265
to clam up about what happened

585
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:28,726
so that none of us
would hear about it.

586
00:54:28,852 --> 00:54:30,978
So, I'm wondering...

587
00:54:31,187 --> 00:54:33,939
What? If... if he's gonna pay you
to clam up, too?

588
00:54:34,899 --> 00:54:36,191
No.

589
00:54:36,317 --> 00:54:40,070
Why would Josh do that?
Why does he wanna hide stuff?

590
00:54:40,196 --> 00:54:41,697
Why would he pay people to lie?

591
00:54:41,906 --> 00:54:44,658
'Cause he's a producer.

592
00:54:45,326 --> 00:54:47,995
Let me know if you reach Wadim.

593
00:54:54,252 --> 00:54:56,420
Wadim, Wadim, Wadim, Wadim.

594
00:56:30,473 --> 00:56:31,473
Get off my set!

595
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,726
Hey, relax. I'm doing my job.

596
00:56:35,186 --> 00:56:35,811
Go!

597
00:56:48,825 --> 00:56:51,368
Bela, what is wrong?

598
00:56:52,454 --> 00:56:55,372
You seem threatened by something.

599
00:56:55,498 --> 00:56:58,000
There's something unstable.
Do you hear me?

600
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:06,550
Stay away from me!
What do you want from me?

601
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:10,679
You must...
you must go back to work.

602
00:57:10,805 --> 00:57:14,808
Finish this film.
That is what we came here to do.

603
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:18,812
And you... I want to help you.

604
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:26,653
I've seen you before.

605
00:57:56,851 --> 00:57:59,186
Marcus.

606
00:58:02,607 --> 00:58:05,484
Marcus. Marcus.

607
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:08,404
You were shouting again.

608
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:11,657
I came in. It was like
you were sleepwalking.

609
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,287
What?

610
00:58:18,164 --> 00:58:21,667
I found these.
They are for your disorder.

611
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:24,044
You must take them.

612
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,921
No.

613
00:58:26,047 --> 00:58:27,965
No, I can't.

614
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:33,053
It takes everything away.
I- I-I can't sense anything.

615
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:35,014
But this is good, Marcus.

616
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:38,100
The crew have voted
to return to work.

617
00:58:38,226 --> 00:58:41,937
You must take the pills
and finish the film, yes?

618
00:58:44,315 --> 00:58:45,649
Oh.

619
00:58:45,775 --> 00:58:48,277
Marcus, I want to help you.

620
00:58:48,403 --> 00:58:50,362
Look at me.

621
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,201
Take the pills.

622
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:59,246
It's time.

623
00:58:59,372 --> 00:59:01,457
We must finish it.

624
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:04,293
That is what we came here to do.

625
00:59:27,567 --> 00:59:29,902
Oh, Marcus.

626
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:36,075
TAMl: Quiet on set, please.
We're rolling.

627
00:59:40,413 --> 00:59:42,122
And action.

628
01:00:37,595 --> 01:00:39,346
Marcus?

629
01:00:40,265 --> 01:00:41,515
Cut!

630
01:00:41,641 --> 01:00:42,975
Stop! Stop!

631
01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:44,476
Marcus.

632
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:05,873
Look out!

633
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:32,024
Whoa, where's Romy?

634
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:33,525
Where's Romy?

635
01:01:33,651 --> 01:01:36,278
- Have you seen Romy?
- Get off me!

636
01:01:40,825 --> 01:01:42,451
Romy!

637
01:01:42,577 --> 01:01:45,621
- Say, Tami, have you...
- Get away from me!

638
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:55,923
Aah!

639
01:02:09,354 --> 01:02:11,063
Hey, Peter!

640
01:02:11,189 --> 01:02:12,606
Stop it!

641
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:15,526
Marcus, you get inside!

642
01:02:18,863 --> 01:02:19,905
Marcus!

643
01:02:20,031 --> 01:02:21,907
Marcus, where are you going?

644
01:02:22,033 --> 01:02:24,034
I'm gonna stop this.

645
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:27,121
Marcus, come on.

646
01:02:27,956 --> 01:02:29,748
Come back. Get inside.

647
01:03:39,611 --> 01:03:42,529
No!

648
01:03:45,825 --> 01:03:47,409
- Mama!
- Matya!

649
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:54,833
Stop!

650
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,636
Soon she is reborn.

651
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:34,016
Then mother and child,
that they cry no more.

652
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:36,268
Who are you?

653
01:05:36,394 --> 01:05:39,313
But this, I tell you already.

654
01:05:39,522 --> 01:05:40,939
I am waiting.

655
01:05:41,066 --> 01:05:43,776
All the years, I keep seed waiting...

656
01:05:43,902 --> 01:05:48,489
waiting for someone like you
to plant again.

657
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,992
What do you want from me?!

658
01:05:52,118 --> 01:05:55,954
Just take it, Mr. Reed... the seed.

659
01:05:56,164 --> 01:05:59,291
You have the blade.
That is why you have the blade.

660
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:01,085
Take it. Take it.

661
01:06:01,294 --> 01:06:03,629
Take it.

662
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,297
Yes! Yes!

663
01:06:06,758 --> 01:06:08,509
No!

664
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,568
Ugh!

665
01:06:27,445 --> 01:06:30,280
It is yours now. It is in you.

666
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:33,909
Plant it well for me.

667
01:06:34,035 --> 01:06:35,244
I want my girl.

668
01:06:35,453 --> 01:06:37,788
Do you hear? I want my girl!

669
01:06:37,914 --> 01:06:39,331
I must have her!

670
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,697
Where are you?

671
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:43,812
No!

672
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:03,791
Aah!

673
01:09:14,154 --> 01:09:17,823
I know what they did to you.

674
01:09:23,246 --> 01:09:24,163
Matya.

675
01:10:34,859 --> 01:10:35,984
Marcus.

676
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,198
I promised him.

677
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:46,245
I promised I would carry his child
and raise it to be his.

678
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:49,248
I chose you, Marcus. Please.

679
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:51,375
Whatever we want, it is ours.

680
01:10:51,584 --> 01:10:53,377
I beg you.

681
01:10:53,586 --> 01:10:56,964
Marcus, I chose you.

682
01:10:57,173 --> 01:10:58,507
All we must do is have his child.

683
01:10:58,717 --> 01:11:00,759
He just wants his child.

684
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:15,190
He just wants his child.

685
01:11:15,358 --> 01:11:19,111
Give him his child
and nothing will happen to you.

686
01:11:29,539 --> 01:11:31,081
Marcus!

687
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:37,838
Marcus, no!

688
01:11:43,636 --> 01:11:44,803
You can stop her!

689
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:46,722
Put her out of her pain!

690
01:11:50,268 --> 01:11:52,728
You can give her life again, Marcus!
I beg you!

691
01:11:59,736 --> 01:12:01,737
Marcus!

692
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:08,035
Please come down!

693
01:12:14,417 --> 01:12:16,335
Marcus!

694
01:13:02,716 --> 01:13:04,174
Claire!

695
01:13:13,393 --> 01:13:16,645
I told you not to come.
I told you.

696
01:13:16,771 --> 01:13:20,399
No, Marcus, I told you.

697
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:26,321
Marcus.

698
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,574
What?

699
01:13:29,367 --> 01:13:31,243
Who are you talkin' to?

700
01:13:31,369 --> 01:13:32,911
Claire.

701
01:13:35,582 --> 01:13:38,334
Marcus, Claire's dead.

702
01:13:39,502 --> 01:13:41,462
Claire died months ago.

703
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:43,964
It's the reason you wanted
to come back to work.

704
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:46,925
To get your life back, remember?
It's a second chance.

705
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:51,680
No!

706
01:13:56,436 --> 01:13:58,187
I should be there with you.

707
01:13:58,313 --> 01:14:00,314
No.

708
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:04,360
Claire, you can't be there.
It's impossible.

709
01:14:05,278 --> 01:14:07,488
What are you doin' here?

710
01:14:08,907 --> 01:14:11,617
I'll call you when I land.

711
01:14:14,162 --> 01:14:16,538
I didn't do a good job
looking after you.

712
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,583
I'm gonna make amends
from now on.

713
01:14:19,709 --> 01:14:21,585
You can mess
with my sister's head.

714
01:14:21,711 --> 01:14:23,420
You can bullshit people
with your visions

715
01:14:23,546 --> 01:14:25,964
or whatever the hell they are,

716
01:14:26,091 --> 01:14:28,801
but you're not special,
you're just sick!

717
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:30,302
It's my fault.

718
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,429
Marcus, just go.

719
01:14:32,597 --> 01:14:34,264
Claire, stop it.

720
01:14:49,322 --> 01:14:52,366
Marcus,
you're seeing things again.

721
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:58,205
You need to talk to somebody.

722
01:15:04,379 --> 01:15:06,380
Hey, hey. Take it easy.

723
01:15:06,506 --> 01:15:08,215
No!

724
01:15:10,093 --> 01:15:12,302
Marcus!
- Don't hurt him.

725
01:15:17,475 --> 01:15:19,101
Romy.

726
01:15:21,021 --> 01:15:24,732
Romy, I'm sorry.

727
01:15:26,109 --> 01:15:29,778
I'm sorry. He's... he's not well.

728
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:43,500
It'll be okay. I'll get this film
back on track.

729
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:47,629
I'll get it made.
I'll make sure of it.

730
01:15:47,756 --> 01:15:50,132
You'll see.

731
01:16:18,536 --> 01:16:22,122
Marcus, you can stop her!
Put her out of her pain!

732
01:16:22,332 --> 01:16:26,502
You can give her life again, Marcus!
I beg you!

733
01:16:34,052 --> 01:16:37,763
Marcus, you can stop her!
Put her out of her pain!

734
01:16:37,972 --> 01:16:41,392
You can give her life again, Marcus!
I beg you!

735
01:16:42,268 --> 01:16:44,895
Claire.

736
01:17:17,095 --> 01:17:18,762
Pleasure to meet you, Romy.

737
01:17:18,888 --> 01:17:20,764
Can you tell us
where you're from, please?

738
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:22,975
I am from Moldova.

739
01:17:23,101 --> 01:17:25,602
Oh. How did you hear
about us?

740
01:17:25,729 --> 01:17:27,896
I am here
in Bucharest, auditioning.

741
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:30,149
I heard about your movie.

742
01:17:30,275 --> 01:17:32,985
Okay, great.
Uh, how tall are you?

743
01:17:33,111 --> 01:17:36,071
I am almost 1.8 meters.

744
01:17:36,197 --> 01:17:38,323
That's in, uh, U.S...?

745
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:39,491
5'11."

746
01:17:39,617 --> 01:17:42,161
Oh. Would you mind slating
your name for the camera, please?

747
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:43,829
Just look directly into camera.

748
01:17:43,955 --> 01:17:45,914
Romy Bardoc.

749
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:46,915
Thank you.

750
01:17:47,042 --> 01:17:49,835
Please also just say
which role you're reading for.

751
01:17:49,961 --> 01:17:54,006
I am auditioning for Chavi.
I would like to play this part.

752
01:17:54,132 --> 01:17:56,550
Okay. Go ahead.

753
01:17:57,344 --> 01:18:01,930
Perhaps you're upset
because you've lost her.

754
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:05,476
And that makes her
even dearer to you.

755
01:18:05,602 --> 01:18:08,228
But I've lost people, too.

756
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:08,854
Josh.

757
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:11,565
And I can't bear to go
through this again.

758
01:18:11,691 --> 01:18:15,361
Please, understand.

759
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:18,781
You can't let the past
keep holding you back

760
01:18:18,907 --> 01:18:21,742
from what lies ahead in the future.

761
01:18:22,577 --> 01:18:24,703
I want you to know something.

762
01:18:24,829 --> 01:18:27,581
I saw you interviewed.

763
01:18:27,707 --> 01:18:33,045
But when I first saw you,
you seemed strong...

764
01:18:33,171 --> 01:18:37,508
powerful even, if I may say so.

765
01:18:37,634 --> 01:18:39,802
And I wanted to meet you.

766
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:45,349
I thought, I hoped,
that you would change my life.

767
01:18:45,475 --> 01:18:46,809
I chose you.
