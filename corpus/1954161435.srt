1
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,605
Can I go?

2
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,209
- Right on schedule.
- What about Mr Brinway?

3
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,244
Maybe we should really pee
just to make it look good.

4
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,649
He's busy singing. Besides,
he doesn't even know we're gone.

5
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,969
You just let all the Stinkers
leave at the same time!

6
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,607
- I hate it when you call them Stinkers.
- That's what they are!

7
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,802
<i>We sail the ocean blue...</i>

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,527
There's no way they all had to
relieve themselves at the same time.

9
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,087
When you gotta go, you gotta go.

10
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,850
Spencer, Max.

11
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,008
Got a little job for you.

12
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,286
Oh, God! Oh, God!
If Roy catches us in here, we're dead.

13
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,529
And we're stealing his tools.
He'll kill us twice.

14
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,328
Witz, we're on a tight schedule.
Are you in or are you out?

15
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, I'm...in. Definitely in.

16
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,363
Good.
'Cause you're gonna be our test pilot.

17
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,846
I'm out! I'm out!

18
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,886
- All right, Witz, you're the man!
- The man's out. I'm out.

19
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,721
Domino, quit that,
I'm getting a headache. Ow! Ow!

20
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,003
- Mr Brinway, we saw them.
- Not now, this is my number!

21
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,687
- The Stinkers are up to something.
- What?

22
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,522
- They stole Roy's leaf blower.
- What are they doing with that?

23
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,211
- Will you sit still?
- Sorry.

24
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,722
I'm about to go where no kid
has ever gone before.

25
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,083
Make sure his helmet's on tight.
He could land on his head.

26
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,851
My head? Sonny, why me?

27
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,840
You should be happy. You'll be
the first kid to fly in a desk chair.

28
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,089
Did you say "die in a desk chair"?

29
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,850
Finished.

30
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,249
- What did you do that for?
- "S" is for Stinkers.

31
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,047
Mr Brinway calls us that. Why not
let him know we're coming?

32
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,969
Ready for take-off.

33
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,164
If something goes wrong,
hit the eject button.

34
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,931
I rigged the chair with a parachute.

35
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,091
- Parachute? I'm outta here!
- Just close your eyes. It'll be fun.

36
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,203
Everybody, stand clear!

37
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,930
Boy, this is just like <i>Apollo 13.</i>
Me and my pops saw it six times.

38
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,964
Five, four, three,

39
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,164
- two, one.
- Tell my mother I loved her.

40
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,241
Houston, we got a problem.

41
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,406
Loaf, how do we stop it?

42
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,762
Catch it and turn off the leaf blower.

43
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,329
What's it doing?

44
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,201
This isn't so bad.
I feel like I'm still on the ground.

45
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,569
Witz, run like <i>The Fugitive!</i>

46
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,166
- Hi, Roy.
- Hey, what up?

47
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,491
I knew you weren't peeing!

48
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,205
Halt!

49
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,166
Sorry, Mr Brinway.
Is it too late to go now?

50
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,081
- Get inside this minute!
- Yes, sir, Mr Brinway.

51
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,569
Wow!

52
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,842
It shaved his butt.

53
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,324
Hit the deck, Mr Brinway.

54
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,491
Look at that. Mr Brinway runs
just like Scooby-Doo.

55
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,608
Hop on, Mr Brinway.

56
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,724
- Hop on!
- What is that thing?

57
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,208
I don't know, but it's headed
for your new Jag.

58
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,051
- No! Not the XJS!
- Don't worry.

59
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,810
No! No!

60
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,449
Please, take me.
Don't take the Jag.

61
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,842
- Thank you, thank you.
- You can get out now, Mr Brinway.

62
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,089
Oh...the edger's still on.

63
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,683
It's off now, you can come out now,
Mr Brinway.

64
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,364
Sneaking out of opera appreciation,

65
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,963
stealing a leaf blower,
ruining my favourite seersucker suit,

66
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,166
causing several thousand dollars of
car-body damage, and more important,

67
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,410
disrupting the entire summer
enrichment programme here.

68
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,649
Your actions are an egregious assault
on the Dartmoor name.

69
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,242
You leave me no choice.
You're all expelled!

70
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,922
Mr Brinway, may I speak to you
for a moment, please?

71
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,845
- Sonny, what are we gonna do?
- He's just trying to scare us.

72
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,647
He's doing a great job of it.
I just wet my pants.

73
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,764
- I...
- Don't waste your breath, Harriet.

74
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,170
- Once I make up my mind.
- It's like a well-made hospital bed.

75
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,523
Once it's made up,
you can bounce a krone off it.

76
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,645
- The board of trustees' meeting...
- What about it?

77
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,481
Sonny and Lucy and Allen
are all on scholarship.

78
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,083
I don't think the board would like it
if you threw them out on the street.

79
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,127
What if the press were to get
hold of it? It could get really ugly.

80
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,402
The board would fire you.

81
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,251
People would point and laugh at you.

82
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,651
Some may even throw rocks.
You'd have to move to another town...

83
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,205
OK, OK.

84
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,168
I get the picture.

85
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,205
Children, perhaps
I was being a little bit hasty.

86
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,722
I'm very disappointed in you.

87
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,482
But I'm willing
to give you all one more chance.

88
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,881
As of now, you're on double probation.

89
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,722
If any of you steps out of line,
just once, you're all history!

90
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,445
Roy!

91
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,769
I found your desk chair
under the bougainvillea.

92
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,681
- It must've rolled out of your office.
- Rolled out?

93
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,851
Probably had too much oil
on the wheels. Happens all the time.

94
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,648
- Happens all the time, my foot!
- Did you disconnect the ejection seat?

95
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,729
Of course I did.

96
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,046
I guess I didn't.

97
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,124
Ouch!

98
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,282
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine, if I don't move my head.

99
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,003
Attention, Dartmoor children!

100
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,649
Remember, the enriching aquarium
field trip is tomorrow afternoon.

101
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,641
Return your signed parental consent
forms, or you're not going!

102
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,491
There'll be no exceptions!

103
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,411
Sure is exciting about the field trip
tomorrow, isn't it?

104
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,682
Although I am allergic to shellfish.

105
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,680
I get hives and ugly rashes.
Sometimes I can't even breathe.

106
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,171
- How's it feel on probation, loser?
- I'm not a loser, I'm a test pilot!

107
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,840
All you Stinkers are losers, farthead.

108
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,601
Yeah, farthead. You shouldn't be
here at Dartmoor.

109
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,121
You should be in the cemetery.

110
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,529
You're right.
I think I'll go dig myself a hole.

111
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,801
What a cheap, dorky backpack.

112
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,848
Oops. I guess it wasn't closed.

113
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,603
Look at this!

114
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,771
- Pick it up.
- Why don't you make him?

115
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,645
How about we kick your butt so high

116
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,650
you'll be wiping your face
when you go to the toilet?

117
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,606
Yeah, Stinkers rule,
others drool, fool!

118
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,208
Hey, isn't that Mr Brinway over there?

119
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,970
Hi, Mr Brinway!

120
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,403
Hit me and you'll break probation,
butt-brains.

121
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,284
Yeah, butt-brains.

122
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,203
Hey, my backpack!
I'm gonna kill you!

123
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,768
- I'm gonna kill you!
- I wonder how that happened.

124
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,205
Oh, wow.

125
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,721
Harriet, look. Ouch!

126
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,163
It's Spencer Dane Senior
picking up Spencer Dane Junior.

127
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,601
I must have that man on my board.

128
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,488
That way, I can convince him to
donate for the Shakespeare festival.

129
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,805
Mr Dane!

130
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,764
Mr Dane.

131
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,405
Mr Dane.

132
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,050
We'll talk later. You look great!

133
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,369
Roy, get rid of that disgusting
beverage and drive with two hands.

134
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,040
Consider it gone.

135
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,805
Everybody's a critic.

136
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,928
- Loaf, heave it back at him.
- No, that's just what they want.

137
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,091
Yeah, they'll tell Mr Brinway
and we'll all get expelled.

138
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,887
We just can't sit here and take this.
We gotta do something.

139
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,526
How about we beat the crap out of 'em?

140
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,405
Sonny, tell her no!

141
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,969
Does anybody else
feel like throwing up?

142
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,006
- Don't blow chunks on me.
- I got an idea.

143
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,248
What are you doing here?

144
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,011
Sorry, I get bus-sick.

145
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,610
<i>The Springville Aquarium proudly
presents Mysteries of the Oceans.</i>

146
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,087
Somebody had carrots.

147
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,842
They still stink.

148
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,162
You're absolutely right.

149
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,967
By the way, Spencer, have you asked
your father about joining the board?

150
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,687
- I forgot.
- Of course you did. I understand.

151
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,167
You're a busy little man.

152
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,048
You got the money?

153
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,131
You got the merchandise?

154
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,290
Meet out back in the holding area
in 20 minutes.

155
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,770
Octopus? Hey, no way.

156
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,008
Here, pus, pus, pus!

157
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,603
Here, pus, pus, pus. Come here.
Hey, come here, come here.

158
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,928
Come play with Uncle Roy.

159
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,722
OK, I want my keys back.
Hey, I'm not kidding. I'm serious.

160
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,445
No! No!

161
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,680
Excuse me, ma'am, but where
do you keep your killer whales?

162
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,645
Sorry, dear,
we don't have any killer whales.

163
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,128
Oh, that's too bad. Let's go back.

164
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,051
What's the most awesomest thing
you've got?

165
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,720
The most awesomest thing we got?

166
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,730
Well...there's Slappy.

167
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,282
- Sure ain't no killer whale.
- Look how bummed out he is.

168
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,724
- He doesn't look bummed out to me.
- You don't understand sea lions.

169
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,321
They're a very complicated mammal.

170
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,171
He could die in there.

171
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,842
Yeah, right!
He can fart himself to death.

172
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,601
Poor thing. Looks like he's in prison.

173
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,045
The ocean's his home. He belongs there.

174
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,528
Yeah. You're right. We gotta free him!

175
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,042
Free him? We don't even know him!

176
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,801
<i>Free Willy.</i> "Free Slappy". I like it.

177
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,241
How do we get him out of there?

178
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,091
Well, if one kid can free a whale,

179
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,727
five should definitely
be able to free a fat sea lion.

180
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,843
All right, let's review.

181
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,088
Close relatives of the sea urchin,

182
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,124
the sand dollar,
<i>Dendraster excentricus</i>

183
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,530
burrows its anterior end
in the sand with its oral end

184
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,929
the flat side parallel
with the water currents.

185
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,567
- Mr Brinway?
- What is it? Oh, it's you.

186
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,287
- Spencer, what's wrong, son?
- The Stinkers are gone.

187
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,007
We thought you'd want
to find them and expel them.

188
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,407
Excellent job, boys.

189
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,766
If we had a giant crane
with a magnet on the end

190
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,282
and we put a metal collar
around Slappy's neck

191
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,165
then we could hoist him
right out of here.

192
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,331
- I got a magnet at home.
- You got a crane at home?

193
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,443
OK, bad idea.

194
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,085
I got it!

195
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,046
Let's get some scuba gear and
swim through the sewers to the tank?

196
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,208
Uh-huh. No swimming in sewers.

197
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,483
There's alligators
and God knows what else.

198
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,921
OK, the sewer's out.

199
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,763
Hey, that man's taking Slappy
somewhere.

200
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,850
Uh-oh, here comes Mr Brinway.

201
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,042
- He looks pissed.
- Stinkers, freeze!

202
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,402
- What do we do?
- I say we freeze.

203
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,841
No, we run.

204
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,724
No!

205
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,130
Stinkers! Excuse me.

206
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,607
- Get out of the way!
- Stinkers?

207
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,850
Witzowitz!

208
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,166
I've got you, you little Stinker!

209
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,250
- Who are you calling a little stinker?
- My mistake.

210
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,125
You bet it is. Give me that, son.

211
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,848
Go!

212
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,769
- Hi, Roy.
- Hey, Loaf.

213
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,845
Help me!

214
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,611
Somebody help me!

215
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,769
I think we lost him.

216
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,089
I hope I'm too young
to have a heart attack.

217
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,566
- Hey, look, it's Slappy.
- And they got him in a cage.

218
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,721
- Poor little baby.
- That looks like a baby to you?

219
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,768
- You want to go home to the ocean?
- It's fate. We were meant to free him.

220
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,122
This is a big mistake.

221
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,731
- Forget it, I almost got caught.
- I gotta have that sea lion.

222
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,809
Get him yourself. I'm out.

223
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,209
That's the last time I do business
with a punk kid like you!

224
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,129
Hey!

225
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,202
- What happened?
- I don't know.

226
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,562
- The door opened.
- He ran out.

227
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,331
I think it's locked from the outside.

228
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,042
Lucky thing I'm not paying
by the pound.

229
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,048
You're gonna pay for that, fatso.

230
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,288
- Just give me my money.
- Wait. I got to pull the van around.

231
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,006
- You're on your own.
- Thanks for nothing.

232
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,568
You're going nowhere, lard-butt.
I'll be right back.

233
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,684
There he is! We've found him.
Isn't that great?

234
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,326
"Great" isn't the word for it.

235
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,251
How did you get into another cage?

236
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,569
Don't worry, Slap,
we'll get you out of there.

237
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,291
Where's my flabby fish?

238
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,205
If you feed him, he will come.

239
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,368
Guys, isn't somebody gonna notice

240
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,849
a big fat smelly sea lion on the bus
that wasn't there before?

241
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,522
Witz, you insulted him. Apologise.

242
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,169
Sorry, Slappy. You really are
a very good-looking sea lion.

243
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,967
We have to disguise him.
He has to look like one of us.

244
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,131
You can't park here, it's a red zone.

245
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,687
- Shove your red zone.
- <i>Move your van!</i>

246
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,885
Sorry, officer, you said red zone?
I'll pull out immediately.

247
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,163
That's it.
The Stinkers are all expelled.

248
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,170
I told you, Allen Witzowitz was sick.

249
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,931
They were taking him back to the bus.

250
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,930
- Why didn't they stop when I yelled?
- They didn't hear you.

251
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,489
- You believe this?
- No. They got bored.

252
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,527
We all got bored. It's a field trip,
we're supposed to have fun.

253
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,965
Not listen to you go on and on
about the E-C-H...whatever.

254
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,446
OK, OK, OK.

255
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,520
- Roy, I'm freezing. Close that window!
- Leave it open, Roy.

256
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,451
It's stuffy and someone smells rank.

257
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,964
Well, excuse me, Miss Renuzit.
I was wrestling with an octopus!

258
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,801
Boy, one of you really reeks!

259
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,489
Can I get up now?
My face is in his butt.

260
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,002
No. Keep it there. Don't move.

261
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:44,367
- Come on, Slappy. Jump!
- I don't think he wants to jump.

262
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,531
If we had time, I could build a block
and tackle and swing him down.

263
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,768
- Got any more fish?
- Oh, yeah.

264
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,042
Come on, Slappy!

265
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,208
Come on, Slappy, come on!

266
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,966
I think we killed him.

267
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,562
- Nope. He's alive.
- Better get him into some water quick.

268
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,162
I got it. Mr Brinway's hot tub.

269
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,284
- Are you crazy?
- No. Think about it.

270
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,088
It's close by, he doesn't come home
till late and nobody lives there.

271
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,851
Who'd wanna live with Mr Brinway?

272
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,647
- Come on, Slappy, we're in a hurry.
- Come on, Slappy.

273
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,004
- What's he doing?
- It's the fertiliser.

274
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,407
- He smells fish.
- Yeah.

275
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,251
Come on, Slappy!
There's no fish here.

276
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,727
We'll feed you later.

277
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,564
Boo!

278
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,690
- Look, Slappy. Water, just like home.
- No, it's too hot.

279
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,168
And he's probably used to salt water.

280
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,806
- Perfect!
- Come on, Slappy.

281
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,291
Go in and we'll get you some more fish.

282
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,765
Yeah!

283
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,282
Guys, we got trouble.

284
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,245
There's no more F-I-S-H
in the freezer.

285
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,725
This is scary. I think he can spell.

286
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,171
Ahoy, me hearty.
OK, I got five orders of fries and

287
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,529
48 orders of raw fish.

288
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,611
- That's how you want it?
- Yeah. We'll cook it ourselves.

289
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,283
Well, have it your way.
That'll be $155.45.

290
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,451
Oh, charge it to my good old dad,
Morgan Brinway.

291
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,564
Oh, and give yourself a big fat tip.

292
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,285
Guys, I hate to mess up
a good time...

293
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,926
No, you love messing up a good time.

294
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,930
We gotta get to school. It's almost 5.00.

295
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,408
My mom will have a cow
if I'm not there.

296
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,285
Slappy, stay. We'll be back real soon.

297
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,962
- What about Mr Brinway?
- He never leaves right away.

298
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,482
I'm leaving early today, Harriet.
Ow. Ow!

299
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,170
- Everything hurts.
- Maybe your little shirt is too tight.

300
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,285
- Very observant, Harriet.
- You should go home.

301
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,721
Sit in your hot tub and relax.

302
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,366
That's precisely what I'm going to do.

303
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,529
That is one big gopher hole.

304
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,966
Mr Brinway? Mr Brinway...

305
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,049
That's close enough, Roy.

306
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,326
We got a big problem here. We got
a giant gopher on the grounds.

307
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,411
- Really?
- Yeah. I need more gopher bombs.

308
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,364
I'll try to get him tonight.

309
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,450
I may have to go hand-to-hand
with him. He's really big.

310
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,722
How big?

311
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,322
Based on the length of the trench
he dug, I'd say at least

312
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,568
five, six feet long.

313
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,446
Oh. A six-foot gopher.

314
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,971
- Yeah.
- They're a real problem around here.

315
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,482
Them and those 50-foot
killer chipmunks.

316
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,721
50-foot chipmunks?

317
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,810
Nah.

318
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,490
No way.

319
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,841
Not now, Gordon.
Daddy's got a headache.

320
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,965
And this ridiculous little shirt
isn't helping.

321
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,486
Wow, that is a man-sized bark
you've got there, Gordon.

322
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,523
Come here, you.

323
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,883
Come to Papa.
Come here, sit on Daddy's lap.

324
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,526
Gordon Brinway,
are you getting a cold?

325
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,167
I hope not.
You're my best little buddy.

326
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,201
Gordon...breath mints.

327
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,651
Gordon, thank you, I'm fine.
You'll give me your cold.

328
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,483
Ice cubes?

329
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,890
That darned ice-cube maker is
spitting ice cubes on its own again.

330
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,324
Another expense.
Boy, do I need that hot tub.

331
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,564
Ah, Xanadu.

332
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,404
It's a little chilly today, Gordy.

333
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,203
It's...salty.

334
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,050
And fishy.

335
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,402
What the heck is going on
around here?

336
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,604
That's weird.
Mr Brinway left early today.

337
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,326
- He's in the hot tub.
- With Slappy?

338
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,490
- No. With himself.
- Then where's Slappy?

339
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,969
Now that we've found him,
how do we get him out of there?

340
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,766
We'll never sneak past Mr Brinway.

341
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,123
I say we go home
and deny everything.

342
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,169
No wonder it's so cold.
Someone turned the heat off.

343
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,886
Who did that, Gordy?

344
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,526
What's this?

345
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,688
Fish and chips?

346
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,447
Someone had a party.
I'm calling the police.

347
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,202
Now who could that be?

348
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,602
Fish and chips!

349
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,928
All right, all right, I'm coming.
Hold your horses.

350
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,170
Yes?

351
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,569
Gordon! Gordon, Daddy's locked out.

352
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,922
Oh, forget it!

353
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,689
- Hurry, Slappy, hurry!
- Come on.

354
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,529
What do we do with him now?
It's getting late and he looks bushed.

355
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,686
Why me?

356
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,565
You're the only one with a double bed.

357
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,161
My mom'll have us all arrested

358
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,127
if she finds out that this smelly thing
is in here with me.

359
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,324
Witz, two pieces of advice.

360
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,046
Don't insult him.
And try not to wheeze.

361
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,245
Because to a sea lion, a wheeze
could sound like a mating call.

362
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,363
What? A mating call?

363
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,801
Don't go! Don't go!

364
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,606
Guys, don't go! Don't go!

365
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,690
That's it! Get out of the bed!

366
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,009
Oops. Sorry.

367
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,081
Sh! Keep quiet.

368
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,409
Hon? I don't like
the sound of that cough.

369
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,447
I heard it all the way in the kitchen.

370
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,361
Yeah, I'm worried. I don't want
another attack of the croup.

371
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,484
God forbid.
That was the worst week of my life.

372
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,729
Allen! What did you have for lunch?
It smells like a fish fry in here.

373
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,730
Fish fry? In here?

374
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,161
- What is that lump?
- Lump? What lump?

375
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,491
I could've sworn
there was something.

376
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,082
Oh, well. I'll give you
some cough syrup.

377
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,328
There you go.

378
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,127
And I'll give you some Z-Lax Junior.

379
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,362
There you go.
I want you all cleaned out.

380
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,449
Yes, Mom.

381
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,043
Goodnight, honey. I'm sure
you'll feel all better in the morning.

382
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,043
There you are.

383
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,327
Yuck! Sea lion slobber.

384
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,566
Hear that? It's my stomach.
I have to go to the bathroom. Happy?

385
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,283
Now you stay here and keep quiet.

386
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,167
<i>Allen, are you all right in there?</i>

387
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,810
Fine, Mom.

388
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,961
This is what happens when you eat
a whole bar of Z-Lax. It's not candy!

389
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,611
<i>Go for the gopher.
Go for the gopher.</i>

390
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,126
This ought to get me my seal back.
Here, fatty, fatty.

391
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,889
I gotta start using
that StairMaster I stole.

392
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,608
Yeah, great. I found the fish.
Where the hell are my glasses?

393
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,127
OK, big guy.

394
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,681
OK, your digging days are over.

395
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,770
Missed him.

396
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,680
That is one cagey gopher.

397
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,168
You're going home, Slappy.

398
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,964
OK, let's go.

399
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,924
One,

400
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,202
two,

401
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,011
three!

402
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,085
There it is, Slappy. Your home.

403
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,640
I'm gonna miss you, Slappy.

404
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,447
- Me, too, Slap.
- Yeah...so am I.

405
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,405
- We're all gonna miss you, Slappy.
- I'm not.

406
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:34,050
No of fence. But the sight of you
on my toilet will never leave me.

407
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,286
- Here, Slap. Have one for the road.
- Something's wrong. He's not eating.

408
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:49,044
That's because there's zillions of fish
out there just waiting for him.

409
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,891
Go on, Slappy, you're free.

410
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,324
- Go on, Slappy, dive in.
- Come on, we gotta get him in there.

411
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,648
He just needs a little push.

412
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,969
Why do I always get stuck
with the butt?

413
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,925
You don't move fast enough!

414
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,727
Go on! Go on!

415
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,843
This way!

416
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,161
Come on! Come on!

417
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,163
Look! It's Willy.

418
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,927
Don't you wanna be with Willy?

419
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,805
Don't killer whales eat sea lions?

420
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,800
Gee! Willy looks hungry.

421
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,840
- Uh-oh.
- Now what?

422
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,691
I say we free Slappy
back into the aquarium.

423
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,486
- You're right, Witz.
- I am?

424
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,890
Yeah, I mean, he wouldn't last
two seconds out there in that ocean.

425
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,289
Yeah, Willy'd eat him up
like a fish burrito.

426
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,250
- We messed up, didn't we?
- Yeah.

427
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,762
We can un-mess it.
We gotta get him back to the aquarium.

428
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,486
That's his real home.

429
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,524
We don't have time.
We're late for Parents' Day.

430
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:02,726
- We'll take him with us.
- To Parents' Enrichment Day?

431
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,527
- We can hide him behind Roy's shed.
- Yeah, Roy won't mind.

432
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,647
I really think this is a bad idea. I was
right once, I could be right again.

433
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,124
<i>Dartmoor proudly presents
Mr Morgan Brinway</i>

434
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:22,121
<i>starring in Gilbert & Sullivan's</i>
H.M.S. Pinafore.

435
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,724
Very classy school, huh?
I did ten years here.

436
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,849
Harriet's home-made Swedish
south-western chilli!

437
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,089
Get it while it's hot, hot, hot!

438
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,090
It's an old secret family recipe

439
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,727
passed down from generation
to generation.

440
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,161
From my fingers to your lips.

441
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,284
Don't hawk the chilli
like a cheap carny hustler.

442
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,211
If people are hungry, they'll come over!

443
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,563
- Mr Brinway?
- What is it? Oh, Spencer.

444
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,642
Little Spencer Junior and big Mr Dane.
Now it's Parents' Day.

445
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,810
- We want to try the chilli.
- Excellent choice.

446
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,528
Harriet makes it herself from a secret
Swedish south-western family recipe.

447
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,564
- Don't you, Harriet?
- What do I know?

448
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,889
I'm just a cheap carny hustler.

449
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,970
It's good.

450
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,966
It's very tasty, Harriet.

451
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,731
Thank you, Mr Dane.

452
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,843
Call me Spence.

453
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,724
OK...

454
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,160
Spence.

455
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:42,367
- You run a tight ship here, Brinway.
- He certainly is dressed for it, isn't he?

456
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,082
I've been meaning to ask you, Spen...
Mr Dane.

457
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,281
Yes, Brinway?

458
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,723
I was hoping you'd honour us
by joining our trustees.

459
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,491
If you could find the time, that is.

460
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:08,410
If I did, would I be able to get
some more of this excellent chilli?

461
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,286
All you can eat, Spence.

462
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,323
We'll talk later, Brinway. Come on.

463
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,169
Right, Spen... Ah, Mr Dane.

464
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,890
Harriet, this is big.

465
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,287
This is really, really big.

466
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,842
That man invented the bendable straw,
and now he's going to be on my board.

467
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,841
Stinkers.
I wonder what they've been up to.

468
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,725
One of us should've stayed with Slappy.

469
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,129
- He'll be fine.
- He looked hungry when we left.

470
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,321
The gopher's back.

471
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,202
That is one big gopher.

472
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,325
His mom must've been
messing around with a seal.

473
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,201
This is getting boring.

474
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,482
Spencer Junior,
you shouldn't be waiting in line.

475
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,324
Come with me.

476
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:21,731
Ladies and gentlemen, make way
for Dartmoor's Student of the Year...

477
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,809
Off! Off! Off!

478
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,729
Take a hike!

479
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,649
- Thanks, Mr Brinway.
- Oh, call me Morgan.

480
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,080
Thanks, Morgan.

481
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,565
Anybody see a giant gopher?

482
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,685
Slappy, sh!

483
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,370
- Was that a sea lion?
- Sea lion? I don't think so.

484
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,404
It's only Roy.

485
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,966
Gosh, Roy's gone berserk.

486
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,811
Roy, what are you doing?

487
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,607
I got him, Mr Brinway.
That gopher's in here somewhere.

488
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,883
Somewhere in these bushes.
There he is!

489
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:52,450
That's not a gopher!
That's a wild sea lion, you imbecile!

490
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,962
Roy, give me that thing
before you destroy something.

491
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,650
Roy!

492
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,605
Roy...let go!

493
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,570
Hey! Hey!

494
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,207
Oh, save yourself, little Spencer Junior!

495
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,924
Hey! My son is on that thing!

496
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,563
Look out, Max!

497
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,330
Spencer!

498
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,202
What kind of a lousy operation
are you running here, Brinway?

499
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,609
- Huh?
- I don't know.

500
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,007
Spencer Junior hurt his arm.

501
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,569
If it is broken, I wouldn't want
to be in your shoes.

502
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,048
Come on. Hold your head up,
we are not embarrassed.

503
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,130
I don't know what school
I'm gonna put you in.

504
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,560
Oy!

505
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,209
Hey, you!
What are you doing with Slappy?

506
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,724
Stand back. I'm from the aquarium.
I'm taking him back where he belongs.

507
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,891
- He hates it in there.
- Stand back. He might bite you.

508
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,085
- He wouldn't bite anybody.
- Just leave him alone!

509
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,489
You? You're in enough trouble as it is.

510
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,251
You're lucky I don't press
seal-napping charges.

511
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,968
- Seal-napping charges? Jail? No good.
- No good.

512
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,682
My beautiful school looks like a war zone.

513
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,611
And you Stinkers are responsible.

514
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,970
All we wanted to do was help Slappy.

515
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,447
It was my idea.

516
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,531
So if you want to be mad at somebody,
you should be mad at me.

517
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,245
And me.

518
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,965
And me.

519
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,691
And me.

520
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,770
I guess me, too.

521
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,850
Well, that's very touching.

522
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,170
Yeah, just like the scene in <i>Spartacus</i>
when they said they were all...

523
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:23,206
Quiet! You have all broken
double probation.

524
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,288
You don't belong here
at the Dartmoor Academy.

525
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,331
You're all expelled.

526
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,329
For life!

527
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:49,164
Hi, we're from the Springville Aquarium,
and we got a call about a sea lion here.

528
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:53,126
You're too late. Some guy from
your aquarium already picked him up.

529
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:58,008
But that's impossible. We came
right down. What did he look like?

530
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,044
Big, ugly, thick glasses and greasy hair.

531
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,720
Sounds like Boccoli got his sea lion.

532
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,651
- Who's Braccoli?
- Anthony Boccoli.

533
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,049
He's an animal broker and a real low-life.

534
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,288
He bribed a handler to get Slappy.

535
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,006
He teaches the sea lion dog tricks

536
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,125
then sells it to a Bulgarian circus
or wherever.

537
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:24,565
A Bulgarian circus?
That means Slappy is in big trouble.

538
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,366
But you'll find him and save him, right?

539
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,848
I wish we could,
but the police don't have the time

540
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,010
and we don't have the personnel
to track him down.

541
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:39,206
All we can do is hope that, wherever
he winds up, they'll treat him well.

542
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,804
- Hey, Roy.
- Hey.

543
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,970
- Hope it's OK we came over.
- You're always welcome.

544
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,084
Just make sure Mr Brinway don't see you.

545
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,087
You guys look kind of down.

546
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,409
We just can't get Slappy
out of our heads.

547
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,683
We freed him when he didn't
want to be freed

548
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,089
then we gave him to a really bad man.

549
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,410
Now when he needs to be freed,
we can't do anything about it.

550
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:41,050
- Yeah, we're just a bunch of losers.
- That's enough of that kind of talk.

551
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,483
You're Stinkers and
that means something here.

552
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,651
No. You are all special
because of who you are.

553
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:55,371
Who you are is what makes you special,
because that's all you are - is special!

554
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,562
There. Now how do you feel?

555
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,769
- Lousy.
- Well,

556
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,487
sometimes it works
and sometimes it don't.

557
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,406
- What's this, Roy?
- Careful.

558
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,685
- That's my gopher-bomb launcher.
- Is that all it launches?

559
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,090
No, this launches everything.
Get me one of those potatoes.

560
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,049
- There you go.
- OK. Stand clear.

561
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:43,008
That sucker's gonna fly a quarter
of a mile due north into the woods.

562
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,124
Isn't that due north?

563
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,044
Oh, yeah.

564
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:57,168
$155.45 for Barney the Buccaneer's
Fish & Chips?

565
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,765
I never ordered that.

566
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,408
I bet Boccoli has a hideout.
All bad guys have hideouts.

567
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,650
- I don't like where this is going.
- If only we could find his hideout.

568
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:15,562
- Then we could save Slappy.
- I really don't like where this is going.

569
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,604
If we were him, where would we hide?

570
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,804
Does anybody else
not like where this is going?

571
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,527
One thing for sure,
he'll need a lot of fish.

572
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:48,206
Do you know a big mean man who
buys a lot of fish and never shaves?

573
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,485
- Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
- I'm going into my pre-hive mode.

574
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,126
- Lot of shellfish around here.
- Hey, look.

575
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,130
The creep's over there buying fish.

576
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,930
Excuse me, sir.

577
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,726
I mean, miss.

578
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:16,643
That man you just sold fish to,
this kid thinks it's his father.

579
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,162
- What?
- That split on him five years ago.

580
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,250
Ran out on you, huh? Looks the type.

581
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,808
Did he say where he lives?
His mom wants to talk to him.

582
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,164
I bet she does. He tried to get me
to go home with him.

583
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:36,924
- An old sawmill on Mud Mountain.
- Great, you'll see your daddy again.

584
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,441
Good old Pop.

585
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,205
To do this right, we'll need
a lot of special equipment, Loaf.

586
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,483
- No problem.
- Are you guys nuts?

587
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,890
- We can't go up there. He'll kill us.
- We got Slappy into this.

588
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,448
- We'll get him out.
- We're all Slappy has.

589
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,405
We're his family. Families stick together.

590
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,571
Remember what Roy said? We're Stinkers
and that means something.

591
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,650
- Let's rumble.
- Yeah!

592
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,926
Come along, come along.
What a perfect day for birdwatching.

593
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:17,329
This is the mating season
for the common loon.

594
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,807
Now I'm excited.

595
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,130
I'm glad you finally got a birdwatching
outfit like mine, Harriet.

596
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,802
Last time you wore that leopard print
you frightened the finches.

597
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,324
Well, I hate it. Now I look like a boy.

598
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,485
Right.

599
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,249
I really miss the Stinkers.
I wonder what they're doing right now.

600
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,002
Well, they're probably doing hard time
at San Quentin Junior Penitentiary.

601
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,208
Gordon, move along, son.

602
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,607
Good boy.

603
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,971
- There it is.
- This place is great.

604
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,288
I found more stuff we can use.

605
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,007
- Everything set?
- We're ready, Sonny.

606
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,690
It's a go.

607
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,770
You wanna eat? You gotta jump, fatso.

608
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,488
I promised these Bulgarians a trained
seal act and that's what I'll deliver.

609
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,728
Come on. Come on.

610
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,526
Come on, get up. Get up!

611
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,643
<i>Anthony Boccoli!</i>

612
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,003
<i>You are surrounded by hundreds
of police</i>

613
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,406
and marines!

614
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,841
Police and marines?

615
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,850
<i>Come out with your hands up!</i>

616
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,331
You're not going anywhere, blubber-puss.

617
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:48,326
All right, you little piss-ant,
you're in serious trouble now!

618
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,842
- I'll give you a beating you'll never forget.
- Now!

619
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,042
Loser!

620
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,044
What...?

621
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,284
What is that, huh?

622
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,484
I'm being attacked by the Seven Dwarfs!

623
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:35,081
Where are you? I'll kill you!

624
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,520
Over here!

625
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,163
Wait.

626
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,360
Wait. Wait. Now!

627
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,608
Surprise!

628
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,010
His nose exploded.

629
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,171
Hit it!

630
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,243
Hit it, Domino!

631
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:22,323
- Hit it!
- Domino, hit it now!

632
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:34,566
- Nobody leaves here alive.
- Let me go! Let me go!

633
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,649
Witz, help me!

634
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:41,448
- What's the matter?
- I'm too skinny, it won't budge.

635
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,890
One, two, three.

636
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,604
Oh, my nose!

637
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,646
What did I do?

638
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,204
I'm finished. I'm dying. I'm dead.

639
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,842
- Oh, yes!
- All right!

640
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,370
I'm alive!

641
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,562
- Witz, you saved me. You're a hero.
- Oh, it was nothing.

642
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:32,561
Well, it was something.
I don't think I'll ever do it again.

643
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,562
Maybe I will.

644
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,127
I feel pretty good.

645
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,761
Hey, you lousy kids!

646
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:54,522
You cut me down from here,
or I'll rip you all to pieces!

647
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,563
Come here! Come here!

648
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,728
Come back here. If I get a hold of you...

649
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:04,242
Oh, no, look at what he did to Slappy.

650
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,766
- All right, you're welcome.
- Gotta find something to bust this.

651
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,964
- How about this?
- Yeah.

652
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,481
- Did I mash your finger?
- No, he's back!

653
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,047
It's over.

654
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,764
Push!

655
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:47,286
- Burning, burning! Hot, hot, hot!
- Come on!

656
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,720
Get outta here!

657
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,726
What about Slappy?

658
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:57,244
- Come on, Slappy, pull.
- Pull, Slappy, pull hard!

659
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,171
Come on, Slap! Come on, Slap!

660
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,442
Come on, Slap!

661
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,927
Yes!

662
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,324
Oh, no!

663
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,284
He's stuck. We got to get this chain off.

664
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,528
Wait. I just got an idea.

665
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:37,840
- Yes.
- Sometimes, things are just that simple.

666
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,528
That guy's like a...blind Terminator!

667
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,529
Run!

668
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:00,241
- Are you sure this thing'll work?
- Sure I'm sure. I think.

669
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:03,091
- It has to work.
- OK.

670
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,687
- Everybody ready?
- You bet.

671
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,090
We're going too fast. Hit the brakes!

672
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,408
At least test them.

673
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,603
- They worked.
- Phew.

674
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,720
Come on, show your faces.

675
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,369
Look at that.

676
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:03,882
What now? Uh-oh!
Guys, you're not gonna believe this.

677
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,446
Oh, no.

678
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,528
- Come on.
- Go, go, go!

679
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,408
Go faster! Go faster!

680
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,843
- Sonny, faster!
- Sonny, move it!

681
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,842
Yeah, come on!

682
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,403
Watch out!

683
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,607
Come on, come on!

684
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,730
Thought I'd sit up here for a while.

685
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,527
- I'm gonna get you punks!
- Sonny, hurry!

686
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,523
Darn it!

687
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,522
Mr Brinway?

688
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:33,408
- Do you hear that?
- Quiet. It might be the common loon.

689
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:37,366
They're very rare.
And you don't want to scare it.

690
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,240
Binoculars up.

691
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:51,843
Look, he's wiggling his tail feathers.

692
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,366
Harriet, will you hold my sunglasses?

693
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,006
Hush, Gordon Brinway, hush!

694
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:11,330
Hush!
You'll frighten the loons, son.

695
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,320
Look out, Mr Brinway!

696
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,485
Attaboy, Gordon.

697
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,366
- Mr Brinway, what are you doing here?
- Stop! Stop this thing!

698
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:34,121
- We can't. We're on the I am.
- Yeah!

699
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,566
- Slow down! Slow down!
- Sonny, where are you going?

700
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,240
He can't follow us in there.

701
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:47,161
Brake it! Brake it!

702
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,761
Brake! Brake! Brake!

703
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,687
Whoa. Whoa!

704
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,089
Whoa! Everybody, lean back!

705
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,162
That's it. I'm getting off
this ridiculous contraption.

706
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:11,807
- Stay down, Mr Brinway.
- Stop touching me!

707
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,527
- Sit down or you'll tip us over.
- No, it's Boccoli again.

708
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:19,691
- What's Broccoli?
- Anthony Boccoli, he's gonna kill us.

709
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,929
What is he talking about?

710
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,726
We can go down the flume into the lake.

711
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,402
- Oh, like fun we will!
- He'll never follow us.

712
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,241
- How do you know?
- Would you, if you didn't have to?

713
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:39,121
- Well, I'm not going.
- Oh, yes, you are, Mr Brinway.

714
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,129
But I can't swim.

715
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:44,961
What are you worried about?
The fall will probably kill you.

716
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,489
Water?

717
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,408
Bye-bye, you little punks.

718
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:16,083
Must be freakin' clogged.

719
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,170
Why, you...!

720
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,844
Water!

721
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,644
- Water!
- The lake!

722
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,842
- Get ready!
- All set.

723
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:50,443
- I'm a test pilot! I'm a test pilot!
- This is great!

724
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,883
Who cares?
I'm gonna die with the Stinkers!

725
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,411
Loaf, hit it!

726
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,721
- Wow!
- Wow!

727
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,651
- Wow!
- Wow!

728
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,525
Loaf, you're a genius.

729
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,127
- All right!
- We're saved!

730
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,802
Look at that!

731
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,728
That has got to hurt.

732
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,447
