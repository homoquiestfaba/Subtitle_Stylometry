- Hi.

181
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,208
How was Philly?

182
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,125
I went from the airport
to a conference room

183
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,250
and then back to the airport
three hours later.

184
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,500

- Mm.

Yeah, he was the lead of every play
in high school, college.

187
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,208
And then we moved to New York.

188
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,000
I am sick of waking up at 5:00

189
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,416
to get in line outside
the Equity Building and wait all day,

190
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,208
praying that the director
actually even agrees

191
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,500
to see anyone that's non-union, and then,

192
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,166
when I finally do get in the room, I sing…

193
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,291
I don't know, six measures,
if I'm lucky, before they cut me off

194

196
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:57,125
And then a week later, he got a job
at a fancy advertising company,

197
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,333
making high five figures. [exhales]

He never looked back.

200
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,250
You know, for someone who's broke,

201
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,458
you could probably spend
a little bit less on party planning.

202
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,833
[Jon] Well, what is the point of money,

203
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,125
if you're not gonna spend it
on the people you love?

204
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,666
- Yeah, except you don't have any money.
- Oh, right.

to remind you to pay your bills on time.

208
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,583
How will I ever survive?

209
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,250
That's a very real question.
Have you found a new roommate yet?

210
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,416
I've been a little busy. You know.
My workshop is next week.

Oh, I don't know. It's, uh…

337

It's at the bottom of a very large pile.

338
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,125
Oh!

339
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,500
Mm.

[Jon] Wow. That's pretty.

344

hiring new teachers for the dance school.

345

- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

346
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,166
Work a couple of hours a week.
Then the rest of the time is yours.

347
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,166
- Free studio space whenever you want.
- Hey… Whoa…

348
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,208
- Can we just talk for a second?
- Mm.

349
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,000
Can we just talk about
how amazing you were tonight?

350
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,125
- Thank you.
- I am not messing around.

351
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,708
I could just watch you dancing forever.

352
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,500
I was thinking of maybe applying.

353
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,208
- Hm?
- To the job in Jacob's Pillow.

354
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,500
- We went there last summer, remember?
- Oh.

355
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,833
We saw the new Mark Morris.

356
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,458
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah.

357
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,666
- That's the place in the Berkshires?
- Mm-hm.

358
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,916
So, you're gonna move to the Berkshires?

359
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,041
And not have to work
30 hours a week doing word processing

360
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,208

361
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,708
I might actually be able
to get back into shape.

362
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,875
Okay. Yeah. All right.
Let's do it. Let's move.

363

- I'm being serious.
- Hey, I'm being serious.

364
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,375

We're gonna hunt… acorns.

368

You've been there.

369

I'm so sorry.
Can we... Can we please go inside?

370
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,291
Sorry, I just feel like I'm scared...

371

to lose sensation in my extremities.

372

373
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,125

374
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,541

- Yeah, sounds amazing.
- I already applied for it.

381
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,958
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

382
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,958
- And I got it.

- Yeah.

385
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,625
Okay. So this is just for the summer?

386

No. Mm-mm, it's permanent.

Whoa, the Berkshires?

389
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,791

392

And she says,
"I want you to come with me."

393
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,083
- What did you say?
- I said, "Oh?"

I didn't know what to say.

I mean, like, I can't…
I can't leave New York.

397
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,000
- Oh, tell her to move in with you.
- Move in where?

398
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,583
You need a new roommate, right?

399
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,625
It's two birds, one stone.
You are very welcome.

400
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,625
Okay, so, what… what about the guy
that you were dating? David?

401
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,500
- I thought you guys were great together.
- It didn't work out.

402
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,458
Oh. There's a focus group
at the office this week,

403
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,583
and they're looking for a few more people.
How about I sign you up?

404
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,333
So you can lure me to the dark side?

405
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,000
No! So I can introduce you
to my colleagues,

406
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,000
and show them how brilliant you are.

407

to have a job in advertising.

- [laughs]
- No, listen.

411

You come up with jingles
all the time for fun, Jon.

412

You come up with songs
about cereal we're eating.

- You could get paid for that.

I… I don't know what the show is.

531

Is it social commentary?
Is it science fiction?

532
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:30,458

Is it rock? Is it Broadway? Is it both?

Is it neither? Steve, what did you think?

534
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,583
I have to say,
I disagree pretty strongly, Walter.

535
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:42,791
I think this is a musical
that knows exactly what it is.

536
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,958
Yes. Yes. Of course, yes. Abso...

537
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:50,291
The world that you've created
is really original.

538
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,958
It's fascinating.

539
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:57,208
The problem is, it's not particularly easy
to follow the emotional thread.

540
00:28:57,291 --> 00:29:01,583
The details distract us
from connecting with the characters.

541

- Okay. Okay.

542

Yes, yes. We're on the same page.
That's exactly how I felt.

We're saying the same thing,
just differently.

544
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,875
But the music, okay, I'm sorry...
The music just wasn't there.

545

559
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:06,583
Can we talk musicians?
Because if it's only gonna be four,

560
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:10,291
then I gotta figure out how
I'm gonna split up the bass parts.

You'll have a piano.

565
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:19,375
I wrote a rock score.

566
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:23,833
So, at the very least I'll need a synth
and drums and a guitar and...

567
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:28,125
A great song should sound great
without any instruments.

568
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,500
Mm. Okay.

569
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,166
Let's just do the song as a cappella.

570
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:34,500
Oh, actually, you know what?
Maybe we'll just skip the songs,

571
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,666
and then we can get the audience
in and out in half an hour.

572
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,416
I will take a look at the budget

573

some money for another musician.

- Sunrise.

1163
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:32,916
The dawn of a new day.

1164
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,083
- Oh! Where did you come from?
- It all goes back.

1165
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:38,958
- You're amazing.
- That is incredible.

1166
01:03:39,041 --> 01:03:41,041
A window looking out on a field.

1167
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:44,500
Oh, and I look out, and I see
the bunnies and little squirrelies...

1168
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:46,625
The beating heart of the nation.

1169
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:49,291
- Ooh!
- [director] Oh, my gosh.

1170
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:52,041
- Absolutely. That's absolutely what it is.
- Beautiful.

1171
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:55,208
- I've never even heard that before.
- You are gifted.

1172
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,500
I could get used to this.

1173
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:00,916
[Jon] <i>I could get paid for this.</i>

1174
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,666
I could get health care. A 401(k).

1175
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:10,125
A BMW. A luxury apartment…
on Central Park West.

1176
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:12,791
- No, no, no… East.
- [laughter]

1177
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:18,041
<i>I could actually be rewarded
for my creativity,</i>

1178
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:21,416
instead of rejected and ignored.

1179
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:24,416
This could be the rest of my life.

1180
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:29,166
Now that we have all those
fabulous ideas of yours in our heads,

1181
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:32,125
we are going to turn to the task at hand.

1182
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:36,916
We are here to develop a name
of a revolutionary consumer product

1183
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,208
that is just about to hit your shelves.

1184
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:40,500
Oh. Wow.

1185
01:04:40,583 --> 01:04:41,791
This is where we're gonna need

1186
01:04:41,875 --> 01:04:44,458
that incredible imagination
of yours, Mr. Larson.

1187
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:48,708
So the product we're looking at
is a tasteless, odorless chemical compound

1188
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:51,625
that will be used as
a fat substitute in cooking.

1189
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:52,583
Mm.

1190
01:04:52,666 --> 01:04:57,083
And it's been successfully tested
on a number of mammals.

1191
01:04:57,166 --> 01:04:58,958
Well, that's good. Mm.

1192
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:01,166
There are some side effects
associated with the product

1193
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:03,125
that I've been instructed
to tell you about.

1194
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:05,000
So it's skin scales.

1195
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:07,458
Um… full hair loss.

1196
01:05:07,541 --> 01:05:10,125
- Hair, eyebrows, eyelashes…
- [ominous music plays]

1197
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:12,458
This could be the rest of my life.

1198
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,458
And finally, in a small number of users,

1199
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:18,166
there were reports
of toxic shock syndrome…

1200
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:22,375
Resulting in a brief hospitalization.

1201
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:25,416
- [man] Eh, no big deal.
- There are no bad ideas.

1202
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:27,083
[ticking starts]

1203
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:29,333
- Free oil.
- Love it.

1204
01:05:29,416 --> 01:05:31,291
- Oil free.
- Okay.

1205
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:35,208
- That's the same thing she just said.
- I switched the words around.

1206
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:37,541
[director] That's totally fine, Kim.
Thank you so much.

1207
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:39,458
- The American Dream.
- Okay, well…

1208
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:41,250
- [Kim] Dreams of freedom.
- Okay.

1209
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:43,666
- [man] Nutra-oil.
- That's not bad, Todd.

1210
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:45,750
[Todd] Waist oil. No.

1211
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:49,291
- [ticking intensifies]
- [dialogue fades]

1212
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:51,958
[discordant music builds]

1213
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:53,708
I got it.

1214
01:05:54,541 --> 01:05:56,708
[laughs triumphantly]

1215
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:59,666
- I have it. I have the exact...
- Go, go!

1216
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:03,083
You wanna hear? I got the exact
right thing for this product.

1217
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:06,500
Chubstitute.

1218
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,875
[Michael] <i>Chubstitute?</i>

1219
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:14,375
- It's a joke.
- It's not funny.

1220
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,375
- Well, maybe not to you but...
- I recommended you, Jon.

1221
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,458
I put my name on the line for you.

1222
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,875
- Tell them I had a stroke.
- It isn't funny.

1223
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:27,916
This is my life.

1224
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,541
No, it's not your life, it's advertising.

1225
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:33,708
It's figuring out how to trick people

1226
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:36,833
into buying shit that they don't want.

1227
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:39,000
Actually, it's a lot more
complicated than that.

1228
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:41,833
I don't understand how
you can take any of this seriously.

1229
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:44,166
- Because they pay me to.
- Money isn't everything.

1230
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,833
- Well, it doesn't hurt.
- Are you sure about that?

1231
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:50,541
What are you doing with your life
that's so noble?

1232
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:55,375
- I'm making art.
- That's what the world needs. More art.

1233
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:59,416
Actually, yes. And at least
I'm not perpetuating a system that's...

1234
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,958
Spare the self-righteousness, Jon.

1235
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:02,708
You're writing musicals
in your living room,

1236
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:04,500
you're not saving the rainforest.

1237
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,416
[whispers] Wow.

1238
01:07:09,416 --> 01:07:11,833
Gosh, I wish I could be more like you,

1239
01:07:11,916 --> 01:07:14,916
and spend my life caring
about driving the right car

1240
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,333
and wearing the right suits
and living in a doorman building.

1241
01:07:17,416 --> 01:07:20,375
Why shouldn't I want those things, Jon?
Not all of us have options you do.

1242
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:22,625
All the things that you take for granted.

1243
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:25,375
- What? Like what?
- Like a life with the person you love.

1244
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:30,416
Do you know what I would give for that?
You... You turn your nose up at it.

1245
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,125
If that's what you want,
what's stopping you?

1246
01:07:33,208 --> 01:07:36,833
What's stopping me? How about
Jesse Helms and the Moral Majority?

1247
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:39,083
How about the people
that run this country?

1248
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:41,541
I can't get married. I can't have kids.

1249
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:46,625
Half our friends are dying and the other
half are scared to death they are next.

1250
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:49,291
So, I'm sorry for getting a nice car, Jon.

1251
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:52,958
I'm sorry for moving into
an apartment with central heating.

1252
01:07:53,041 --> 01:07:56,750
I'm sorry for enjoying my life
while I still have time.

1253
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:57,875
I gotta go.

1254
01:07:57,958 --> 01:07:59,083
Hey.

1255
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:01,833
You wanna come take the subway?

1256
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:03,916
- [Michael] I'd rather walk.
- Michael.

1257
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,916
Michael.

1258
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:09,875

<i>- Hello?</i>
- Rosa Stevens?

1264
01:08:22,416 --> 01:08:25,833
- Are we excited for tomorrow?
<i>- Tomorrow?</i>

1265
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:28,500
The presentation.
You remembered the presentation?

1266
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:31,583
Remembered it?
I got every producer in town coming.

1267
01:08:31,666 --> 01:08:32,833
- [sighs]
- [Rosa laughs]

1268
01:08:32,916 --> 01:08:34,791
- [laughs]
<i>- So it better be good.</i>

1269
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:39,500
Yeah, it's, uh… it's gonna be amazing.

1270
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:42,208
Let's see if we can't get
a bidding war started

1271
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:44,916
on this musical of yours. What do you say?

1272
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:48,208
Yes, sure. [laughs nervously]

1273
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,166
Okay, doll.

1274
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:53,833
Charlie, get me Hal Prince on the line.

1275
01:08:53,916 --> 01:08:55,250
Rosa? Um, I...

01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:56,833

I'm so sorry.

[door squeaks]

1282
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,208
Yeah. I know, I know, I know.

1285
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:56,083
[whispers] Oh, no.

1286
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:59,791
Why wouldn't you have called me
to tell me my payment was late

1287
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:02,000
before you just cut off my power?

1288
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:04,291
How is...? How does that make sense?

1289
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:06,541
[man] <i>Sir, as I explained before,</i>
<i>you received a notice...</i>

1290

No, no, no, listen.

1291
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:10,500
You don't understand. I have a workshop.

1292
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:14,500
I have a public presentation
of my musical in 12 hours…

1293

<i>Sir, if you are going to raise your voice…</i>

1294
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,750
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1295
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:22,208
Look, look, look.
I can pay you over the phone, right now.

1296
01:10:22,291 --> 01:10:25,875
- I have my credit card right here…
<i>- The billing office is closed.</i>

1297
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:28,416
I would love to figure it out right now.

01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:03,833
Yeah.

Um…

Sure, sure. Uh…

1312
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:12,375
Well, can you… um…
can you give her a message for me?

1313
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:15,208
<i>- What is it?</i>
- Well, it's just, you know…

1314
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:20,333
I wanted to remind her that tomorrow
is my workshop and you know, I…

1315
01:11:21,041 --> 01:11:24,000
I know I don't have any right to ask this.
It's just that…

1316
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:28,250
I would just really love her to be there.

I have devoted my youth

I haven't written a single note

of the most important song in the show.

1326

I have no electricity.
