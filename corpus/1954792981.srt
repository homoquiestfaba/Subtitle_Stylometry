1
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:34,233
- All right,
We are leaving the flatlands

2
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:37,736
and we are heading up
towards the mountain top,

3
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,738
which I'll show you right here.

4
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,177
Way up there.

5
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,813
I'm not sure who I'm meeting.

6
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,681
The ad said $1,000 for the day.

7
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,217
Filming services.

8
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,522
Discretion is appreciated,
whatever that means.

9
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,062
So, here's a thought:

10
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,664
What if this is just
some 40-something

11
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,435
who's sitting alone
in her apartment

12
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:15,407
waiting for some young
handsome boy to come up the hill

13
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:20,646
and give rubdowns, money,

14
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:25,250
and whisper sweet nothings?

15
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,485
It's just a thought.

16
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,592
Cute little lake.

17
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,297
Cute little town.

18
00:01:53,613 --> 00:02:00,719
This is promising.

19
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,754
This is it.

20
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,289
A yellow door.

21
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:36,922
Okay.

22
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,530
Okay.

23
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:47,499
No answer and no voice-mail,

24
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,800
so that's good.

25
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,652
Hmm.

26
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,756
Okay, so...

27
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:13,859
I think it's smarter
if I wait in the car.

28
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,366
You know, just...

29
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:28,373
I don't think
this guy's showing up.

30
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,374
Which is too...

31
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,876
- Hi!

32
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,578
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

33
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,779
- Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

34
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,380
- I'm assuming you're Aaron?

35
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,415
- Yeah. I'm Aaron.

36
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,250
- Nice to meet you.
- Josef.

37
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,318
Oh, my God.

38
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,788
Oh, my God.

39
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,225
This is gonna be a good day.
- Yeah.

40
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:51,430
- You have a really nice,
kind face.

41
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:52,998
- Thank you.
- All right.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,303
- Come on.
- Okay.

43
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,539
- I feel like we should just
do this right now

44
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,907
because at the end of the day

45
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,675
it's gonna be normal,
so let me just.

46
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,744
- Oh. Okay.

47
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:09,414
- Trust me, that's not gonna
be anything weird at all.

48
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,289
Never get used to those stairs.

49
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,627
All right.

50
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,462
So, welcome.

51
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:27,499
This is our
family vacation home.

52
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,434
A lot of special memories.

53
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,969
Can see, if you check out
these paintings,

54
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:35,374
I made these with my dad
when I was younger.

55
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:38,844
So, I'm sure
you're anxious to get started...

56
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:40,012
- Yeah.
- On all this.

57
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:41,480
- Okay.

58
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,048
- Let's get you over here.

59
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,983
I am a cancer survivor.

60
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:48,320
I had cancer in the liver,
spread to the lungs.

61
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:49,521
So, pretty bad.

62
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:50,856
They gave me the chemo.

63
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,391
I knocked it out.

64
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:53,992
Really, it was...
went into remission immediately.

65
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,994
It was...
it was pretty incredible.

66
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,963
Unfortunately, two months ago,

67
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,900
I started getting
these dizzy spells and

68
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:06,705
some... some sort of
weird cognitive misfirings.

69
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,007
I went back in
to see the doctor.

70
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,976
Brain tumor
size of a baseball here.

71
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,978
- Oh, no.
- That's inoperable.

72
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,381
Um, so they gave me about
two to three months to live.

73
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,716
I'm hoping I beat it, you know?

74
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:21,086
And the power
of positive thinking.

75
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:24,022
Maybe? You know, who knows?

76
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:28,593
But in case I don't,
I'm married.

77
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,595
My beautiful wife, Angela,
of six years,

78
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,397
is pregnant
with our first child.

79
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,532
Hi, Buddy.

80
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,000
We're calling it Buddy.

81
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:38,970
Um, and have you ever
seen the film<i> My Life?</i>

82
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,439
- No.

83
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,341
- It's a beautiful,
beautiful film.

84
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,942
Michael Keaton gets cancer
in the film,

85
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:49,715
and he makes a video diary
of himself for his unborn son.

86
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,683
- Oh, okay. Yeah.

87
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,118
- Yeah, you can see.

88
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,054
So, our job today
is to keep that camera rolling,

89
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,390
as we discussed,

90
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:03,762
and I just
want you to walk with me.

91
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,430
I don't know
exactly what I'm gonna do.

92
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,532
I want you to document me,
how I am.

93
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,769
I don't need to glorify me
or make me seem cool

94
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,771
or anything other
than what I am,

95
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:17,409
so, Buddy, you can see me
for the man I was.

96
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,644
And, um...

97
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,380
I hope you're up for it.

98
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,852
- Okay.
- Yeah?

99
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,520
- Yeah. Yeah.

100
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,589
Let's do it.

101
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,890
- I thought you
were gonna run away.

102
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,024
- No.

103
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,426
Okay.

104
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,098
- This is for you.

105
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,733
- Oh, that's all right.
- No, no, no, no.

106
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,735
Take the whole thing.

107
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,404
This is, uh...

108
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,073
this is no longer
a business transaction, okay?

109
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,074
- Okay.

110
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,177
- This is a partnership,

111
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,514
and this is a journey
into the heart,

112
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:59,985
and I'm real glad
it's you coming with me.

113
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,654
I think we're gonna do great.

114
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,757
You ready for this?

115
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,958
- Okay, let's do it.
- All right.

116
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
I'm gonna go get in the tub.

117
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,600
- In the tub?

118
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,903
- Yeah, come on up.

119
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:20,906
It's okay. Come on.

120
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,022
- Oh, sorry.

121
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,190
- It's okay.
- Okay?

122
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:39,458
- Yeah, yeah.

123
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,726
We're... we're gonna go

124
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,595
a lot deeper places than this.

125
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,065
- Okay? You all right?
- Yeah.

126
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,533
- You sure?
- Yep.

127
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,235
- Okay.
You sure you're not hungry?

128
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:53,171
You want a sandwich or anything?
- No, I'm okay... I'm okay.

129
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,474
- All right, maybe when we get
out of the tub.

130
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,542
I'm getting in the tub.
You're not getting in the tub.

131
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,777
- Okay.
- Okay?

132
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,739
- Okay.
- All right, get comfortable.

133
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,784
- Okay.

134
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,519
- Okay, you rolling?
- Yep.

135
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,055
- Just checking.
I knew you were.

136
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,957
All right, Buddy.

137
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,894
Welcome to your first tubby.

138
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,128
When I was your age,

139
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,597
I used to take tubbies
with my dad.

140
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,165
We'd call 'em tubby time,

141
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,134
and it was pretty much
the greatest time of the day.

142
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:27,005
So since you and I might not
get to do a tubby together,

143
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:32,077
I thought we would have
our first tubby right here.

144
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,912
You ready?

145
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:34,980
Okay.

146
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,615
All right.

147
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,817
Now, let's get
those tootsies wet.

148
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,585
You ready? Get those tootsies.

149
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:41,686
Boo.

150
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,055
Oh, ooh, it tickles, doesn't it?

151
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,057
Oh, stinker.

152
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,193
Stinker-roo.

153
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,596
Oh.

154
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:53,678
Ooh, this one
actually smells pretty good.

155
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,602
I know, it's fun, isn't it?

156
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,739
I know.

157
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,174
Ooh.

158
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,178
Just lean back
and close your eyes.

159
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,781
A little shampoo.

160
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,717
A massage rub.

161
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,085
Mmm.

162
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,688
Yeah.

163
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,856
Mmm.

164
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,058
Now is my favorite part.

165
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,995
We're just gonna lay back.

166
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,630
Oh, Buddy.

167
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,732
Oh, yeah.

168
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,936
Ooh, ooh.

169
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,706
Ooh, you like the fire?

170
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:39,344
Mm. You just stay here.

171
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,279
We'll watch the fire.

172
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,664
You and me.

173
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,857
Mmm.

174
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,993
I love you so much.

175
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,074
Can't stop thinking about it,
Aaron.

176
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,814
- What?

177
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:20,652
- Two to three months.

178
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:23,054
Most of which I will either be
in pain,

179
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:27,359
or at the very least sad.

180
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,228
I mean, look at this scene.

181
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,963
It's a tubby scene.

182
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,365
It's supposed to be fun.

183
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,367
It's not supposed to be sad,
you know?

184
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:43,808
I just can't help thinking,

185
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,810
"Why wait?"

186
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,415
You know?

187
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:55,387
'Cause I could just
end it right now.

188
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,325
I could, you know.

189
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,340
- Josef?

190
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,109
Hey.

191
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:18,611
Josef?

192
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,751
Hey.

193
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:27,752
Josef.

194
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,426
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

195
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,294
Oh, man,
that was... that was a joke.

196
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,063
It was supposed to be a joke.

197
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,464
I'm so sorry.
That was a bad joke.

198
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,099
Okay.

199
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,767
I've got a weird sense
of humor, man.

200
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,003
I'm...
I'm really sorry about that.

201
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,805
- It's okay.

202
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:50,108
- Um, it was just getting,
like, really serious in here,

203
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,712
and I was just, like, you know,
trying to lighten the mood.

204
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,748
Do you want to go
outside or something?

205
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,917
You want to get some fresh air?
Would that be good?

206
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,485
- Yeah.

207
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,487
- Oh, Aaron. You might want
a heavier jacket.

208
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,322
It's a little chilly out there.
- Okay.

209
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,957
- There's...
there should be something

210
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,158
in the guest bedroom closet

211
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,159
if you want to snag one.

212
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,861
- Okay.

213
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:13,398
Cool.

214
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,167
- What? What? What happened?

215
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,304
What happened?

216
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,305
Oh.

217
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:21,506
That's Peachfuzz.

218
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,908
That's... that's just Peachfuzz.

219
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,310
Say hello.

220
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,479
Um...

221
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,814
Actually, you know,
I'm glad this happened.

222
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,316
Buddy, you're gonna love this.

223
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:34,185
So, Peachfuzz
is a friendly wolf,

224
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,087
and my dad created him

225
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,492
and he actually used to have
this great kind of song

226
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:43,862
that Peachfuzz sings
for little kids.

227
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,030
What do you think, Buddy?

228
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,365
That's Peachfuzz.

229
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,933
Say hi.

230
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,537
All right.

231
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:26,871
Oh, nice.

232
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,006
Look.

233
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,809
Got some hats.

234
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,844
Huh, twinsies.

235
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,446
I'm over here, Buddy.

236
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,382
Right here.

237
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,984
So, look, there's a legend about
this trail that we're going to.

238
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,854
It's called
Las Aguas Milagros de Corazon,

239
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:45,957
which means, "The miracle waters
of the heart."

240
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,225
Your mom and I heard about it

241
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,593
from this really cool
Hispanic lady

242
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:49,828
who runs this taco truck

243
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,229
down by the lake.

244
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,431
Anyway, the lore has it
that there's, like,

245
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,600
a healing body of water out here

246
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,268
that has something
to do with a heart,

247
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,004
but apparently only those
who are pure of heart

248
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,472
can partake of it.

249
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:05,176
So, anyhow, that is what
we're going to find today.

250
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:09,147
How's your heart, Aaron?
- It's good.

251
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,282
- It better be.

252
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,317
Whoo-hoo!

253
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,351
All right, Buddy.

254
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,513
Let's go cure some cancer.

255
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,532
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

256
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,167
- Did you see that?
- No.

257
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:32,170
- Did you see anything up there?
- Uh-uh.

258
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,538
What was it?

259
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,445
- I thought I heard something.

260
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,388
- Josef?

261
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,368
Josef?

262
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,411
Hey, man.

263
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,950
Is everything okay?

264
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:40,705
Oh, my God.

265
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,640
Aaron.

266
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,175
Obviously you didn't see
your face.

267
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,576
Holy cow.

268
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,011
You... here.

269
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,279
I just need to
show you something.

270
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,115
You need to see your face.

271
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,317
All right, you're a little mad.

272
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,618
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

273
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,688
- But oh, my God,
that was incredible.

274
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,425
That was... you just
had a near-death experience.

275
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,592
- Yeah.

276
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,127
- That's what it feels like

277
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,729
when you feel like
you're gonna die.

278
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,632
It's incredible, isn't it?

279
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,600
- Yeah.

280
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,002
- You all right?
- Yeah.

281
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,236
I'm fine. Thanks. Thank you.

282
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,138
- All right.

283
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,741
It's powerful, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

284
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:21,045
- You know,
what's really amazing is,

285
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,313
there was about
two seconds there

286
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,216
after you were done being scared

287
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,338
where it looked like
you wanted to kill me.

288
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,555
- No, I-I-I was...
it was just the...

289
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,423
- I don't take it personally.

290
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,292
I think it was
a visceral reaction, you know?

291
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,728
It's a defense thing, but...

292
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,198
but there's an animal in you.

293
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,035
There's a little Peachfuzz
inside you yet.

294
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,642
Anybody you need to make peace
with in this world?

295
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,277
Before you go?

296
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,782
- I have an ex.

297
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,650
- You have an axe?
- Ex.

298
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,219
- Oh, I thought you were
gonna tell me you had,

299
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,220
like, an axe to grind.

300
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,489
I have an axe back at the house.

301
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,224
- Yeah.

302
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,259
No, I saw it.

303
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,695
- Can I ask you a question
and you'll answer me honestly?

304
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,663
- Okay.

305
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,700
- When you saw that axe
out in front of the house,

306
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,201
was there a small part of you

307
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,404
that thought
I might kill you with it?

308
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,241
- Yeah, but I didn't know you.

309
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,643
- You did?

310
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,646
That's great.

311
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:33,251
- Josef, I don't remember
how long we've been walking for.

312
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,219
Are you getting hungry?
- Yeah, I know, I know.

313
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,521
But you're doing great
and just...

314
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,056
we got to keep in motion.

315
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,357
- Okay.
- Look.

316
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,391
Look. There's a sign.

317
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,193
Hey. Little something.

318
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,164
- All right.
- Healing waters, here we come.

319
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,603
- "Sewer pipeline."

320
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:53,704
It's shit water.

321
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:56,174
- It's something.

322
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,175
Better than nothing.

323
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,310
Come on.

324
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,411
- Josef.

325
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,612
- What's up?

326
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:02,647
- Are you...

327
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,682
you remember how to get back?

328
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:08,319
- No. I don't.

329
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:09,487
- Okay.

330
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,389
It's just we've taken a lot of...

331
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,091
a lot of forks in the road,

332
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,525
switchbacks that...

333
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:16,127
I just... I haven't been
keeping track, so...

334
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,595
- I haven't either.

335
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,163
But that's... I mean,
that's back there, man.

336
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,498
We got to...

337
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,400
- We got to go forward.
- Okay.

338
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,235
- You know,
we can't find the miracle

339
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,871
if we got a rope attached to us,
you know what I'm saying?

340
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,172
- Right.

341
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,844
- Holy shit.

342
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:35,613
Holy shit. Holy shit.

343
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,816
- Josef.

344
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:42,854
- Come see!
It's a lookout point.

345
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,489
See?

346
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,501
Aaron.

347
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:57,802
- Yeah?

348
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,371
- You are not gonna
ever believe this.

349
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:12,683
Aaron, I want you
to point your camera down there

350
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,552
and tell me what you see.

351
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,664
- Oh, my God.

352
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:31,402
It's a heart, man.

353
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:32,837
That's a heart down there.

354
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,543
You were right.

355
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,878
- It's a heart.

356
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,780
But it's also a miracle.

357
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,654
Only the pure of heart
can be healed.

358
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,522
Yes.

359
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,257
Heal those big ol' tootsies.

360
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,561
Amazing.

361
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:57,795
Whoo-hoo!

362
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,932
- Whoo-hoo!

363
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,700
- It's chilly, huh?

364
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,768
All right.

365
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,469
Whoo!

366
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,438
- Whoo!

367
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,741
- Yeah!

368
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,476
Okay, you do me.

369
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,267
Tell you what.

370
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:38,736
I know a little place
called Billy Bear's.

371
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,571
It has the best god damn
pancakes in the world.

372
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,740
- You still hungry?
- Yeah.

373
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,508
- All right. I'm buying lunch.

374
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,377
- All right, let's do it.
- Let's get out of here.

375
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,545
- Okay.

376
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:49,247
- Let's see what's good here.

377
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,915
- It's the pancakes, right?

378
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,685
Didn't you say you used to
come here with your family?

379
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,320
- What's that?

380
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,789
- Didn't you used to
come here for years?

381
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,324
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

382
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:01,659
No, it's just
they changed the menu,

383
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,527
so I was just curious

384
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,562
if there was anything else,

385
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:05,830
but yeah, I mean,

386
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:09,934
obviously the pancakes
are the thing.

387
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,336
Hey, Aaron.

388
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:13,098
- Yeah?

389
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,963
- Have you ever done anything
you're really ashamed of?

390
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,047
- Yeah.

391
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:26,350
- Would you mind
telling me about it?

392
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:29,053
- Uh, yeah, okay.

393
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,054
- Really?

394
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,489
Here, give me the camera.

395
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:32,623
Come on, I'll... it'll be fun.

396
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,624
I'll...

397
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,825
- Okay.

398
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,460
- Take the focus
off of me for a second.

399
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,029
There we go.

400
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,599
Handsome devil.

401
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:43,668
- Um, okay.

402
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,471
Um, I guess... let me think.

403
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:51,008
I was, um...

404
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,443
I used to...

405
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:55,646
I used to just pee my pants
a lot,

406
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,747
um, when I was a little kid.

407
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:57,748
- Ooh.

408
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,817
- And, um...

409
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,954
it got to the point
where my mom got this, uh...

410
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:08,959
device from a mail-order
catalogue that was, um...

411
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:13,064
it was like a... like a thing
attached to my wrist

412
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:17,902
with a wire that went up my arm
and down my shirt

413
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,670
into my pants.

414
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,707
- And with a little sensor
on it that would...

415
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:25,743
that would beep at the sound
of... or at the...

416
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:28,479
it would...
when it felt wetness.

417
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:32,049
And, uh, I remember one time

418
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:35,653
when I was just out on
the monkey bars with my friends,

419
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:37,121
I had to go really bad,

420
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:38,956
and I didn't want to,

421
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:45,062
and I just... I just started
just pissing my pants.

422
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:47,998
And then... and then the monitor
starting going off,

423
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,070
and so there I was,
you know, laying in the sand

424
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:59,443
just with piss all over myself
and this loud alarm going off.

425
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,011
And that was probably
the first time,

426
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:04,415
or at least the first time
I remember, feeling...

427
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,950
feeling shame.

428
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:08,419
- Thanks for sharing
that with me, man.

429
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:09,787
- Yeah.

430
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,455
- It's not easy
to talk about that stuff.

431
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:14,125
- I appreciate it.
- Yeah.

432
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:16,694
Okay.

433
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:19,563
- Can I have a turn?

434
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,898
- Uh, yeah.

435
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,767
Okay.

436
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,825
What?

437
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:52,563
What is that?

438
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,031
Is that...

439
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:58,969
That's me.

440
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:02,807
- Yeah.

441
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,475
I took pictures of you.

442
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,550
- Okay.

443
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,822
Why?

444
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,056
- I don't know.

445
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:31,669
I suppose I was nervous
before you came up,

446
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:34,738
and I felt that
if I got to know you

447
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,609
before you got to know me,

448
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,644
then I would be less scared.

449
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,721
I'm sorry.

450
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:53,557
I wouldn't have done it

451
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:56,994
if I knew you then
like I know you now.

452
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:04,635
And I'm very ashamed of it,
and I hope we can move past it.

453
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,181
Okay?

454
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,218
- Okay. No, I'm... it's...

455
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,788
it's a little weird,
but I'm... I'm past it.

456
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,691
- You are?

457
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:28,792
- Yeah.

458
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,628
Yeah, it's fine.

459
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,800
- Thank you.

460
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:48,913
- Josef.

461
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:50,881
- Yeah?

462
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,883
- I think...

463
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,286
I think I'm gonna head back.

464
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:57,788
Um, I got...

465
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,957
I got all my stuff on me.

466
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:05,229
I just think I'll just
head back down the hill now.

467
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,865
- Oh.

468
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:09,967
Oh.

469
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:13,203
I was going to
pour you a whiskey.

470
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,711
- Yeah, no. It's okay.

471
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:23,347
I-I think, uh...

472
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,115
I think it's a long drive,

473
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:29,186
and it's kind of treacherous
going down the hill.

474
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,721
I think I'll just...

475
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:33,724
- It takes about 20 minutes
going down.

476
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:36,760
You can coast the whole way;
It's not...

477
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:42,099
I think we should
commemorate our day, Aaron.

478
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:47,871
I feel like we should
raise our glasses together

479
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:49,740
and celebrate.

480
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,713
One drink, okay?

481
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:58,849
One drink, and I'll send you
on your merry way.

482
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,188
Please?

483
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,323
- Okay.
- Okay.

484
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,005
- One drink.
- Great.

485
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,871
- Sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

486
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:21,972
I keep doing that.

487
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:22,974
Come on, let's go.

488
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,945
This is great, huh?

489
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:30,848
Two guys having some whiskeys.

490
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,882
It's really great, man.

491
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,084
What a great day, you know?

492
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:35,653
And I don't take my days
lightly.

493
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:36,920
I mean, really.

494
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:38,222
I could've spent it
with my family,

495
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:40,824
but I made a new friend.

496
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,860
Just a great day.

497
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:44,695
- Yeah, it was a good day.
- Yeah.

498
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:45,996
What made you decide
to come up here

499
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,798
and do this with me, anyway?

500
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,102
- I guess it was a job.

501
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,405
- The money, huh?

502
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:55,839
- Yeah.

503
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,810
- You having money problems,
Aaron?

504
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,178
- No.
- It's okay.

505
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,713
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

506
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:04,281
People have money problems.

507
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,186
- I mean, it's tough,
but, you know...

508
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,088
- Of course it's tough.

509
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,458
When I was your age, I didn't
have a row to hoe, you know?

510
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,028
It took a while before I
accumulated the wealth I have,

511
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,932
and I've actually accumulated
quite a bit.

512
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:24,435
And, um...

513
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:26,103
I've been
thinking about it today,

514
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:31,108
and I want to give
you some money, Aaron.

515
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,242
- No, thank...

516
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:33,977
That's... that's nice of you,

517
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,913
but it's okay.

518
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:38,482
- Why is everyone
so uncomfortable with money?

519
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:40,184
Look, if you had
an excess of food,

520
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:42,306
and I was hungry,
wouldn't you give it to me?

521
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,290
- Yeah.
- Yes, you would.

522
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:49,026
Because you're my friend,
and you're kind.

523
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:52,029
I have an excess of money.

524
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:54,998
You have a need.

525
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,999
It's simple.

526
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,968
- Oh, I...

527
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,204
- There's a check
in your boot, Aaron.

528
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,276
Gotcha.

529
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:07,978
All right.

530
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,279
Sorry.

531
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:10,914
There's not a check
in your boot,

532
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,184
but you looked,
which means you need money.

533
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,353
Let me help you.

534
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,422
We don't have
to figure it out now.

535
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:21,291
Just saying.

536
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,493
- Okay, um...

537
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:24,328
- Here. Cheers, to us.

538
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,329
- Okay, cheers.

539
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,468
All right.

540
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,504
Well, I think we're good.

541
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,306
Um...

542
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,442
- Where are you...
are you leaving?

543
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:41,078
- Here.
- Aaron, are you leaving?

544
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,480
- I think it's...
yeah, I think, um...

545
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,215
- I lied to you.

546
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,126
- What... what about?

547
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,801
- Peachfuzz.

548
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,339
Aaron, if I tell you something,

549
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:14,111
would you promise me you would
never tell another living soul?

550
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:17,915
I need to get something
off of my chest, before...

551
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,255
- Okay.

552
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:26,323
- But this is only for you.

553
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,358
Buddy, I'm sorry.

554
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,961
This is not for you to hear.

555
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:35,532
Aaron, would you sit down please
and turn the camera off?

556
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,134
- Um...
- Now.

557
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,602
- Okay.

558
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,279
Okay.

559
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,380
- It's off?
- Yeah, it's off.

560
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:51,915
- Okay.

561
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:59,523
I did something really bad.

562
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:03,360
About four years ago...

563
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:08,265
the internet started
to slow down at our house.

564
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:12,169
Spoke to a guy I knew at work
who said...

565
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:16,974
maybe my browser's history
was full.

566
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,309
I went home.

567
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:22,279
I opened up the internet.

568
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,253
Aaron, such unspeakable things
I saw.

569
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,593
Pornography.

570
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,996
Mostly animal pornography.

571
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,669
There's only two people
who use that internet.

572
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:50,240
Me and my wife, Angela.

573
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,910
And I was not looking
at animal pornography, Aaron.

574
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:59,049
I confronted Angela.

575
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:01,385
She flat-out denied it.

576
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:03,020
What could I say?

577
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,991
I knew it was her.

578
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:10,394
This lie drove a wedge
between us,

579
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:13,697
and we began to drift apart.

580
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:22,406
One weekend, I said we should
come up to the cabin.

581
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:25,042
Right here.

582
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:27,477
But on Saturday,
I was called back to work,

583
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:29,413
so I left Angela here
by herself.

584
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:37,154
The thing is, I wasn't really
called back to work.

585
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:41,525
I went down the street
to the 99 cent store.

586
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,463
There I found a mask.

587
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,233
It was a wolf.

588
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,606
Three hours later,
I came back to the house.

589
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:59,643
I put the mask on.

590
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,678
I broke in
through the back window.

591
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:07,284
Angela was asleep.

592
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:09,119
I tied her up,

593
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:11,989
at which point she awoke.

594
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:13,623
At which point,

595
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,993
we proceeded to have

596
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:21,131
ravenous, animalistic
sexual intercourse.

597
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,536
I'd never seen her so happy.

598
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:32,042
I have to admit, it didn't
feel terrible on my end.

599
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:40,584
I escaped through the window
and left her there, tied up.

600
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:44,021
When I came back
the next morning, as myself,

601
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,722
I asked her how her night was.

602
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:55,065
She said it was fine,
with a casual smile.

603
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,038
We never spoke of it.

604
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,243
We went home.

605
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:10,547
And in the weeks that followed,

606
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:14,351
the internet
got back up to speed.

607
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,792
Aaron, I raped my own wife.

608
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:30,434
So, in summation, this is me
in a nutshell, you know?

609
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:33,737
This is your dear old dad,
warts and all.

610
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:36,173
I want to say
that I love you, Buddy.

611
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:39,076
And, um...

612
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,377
- Okay.

613
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:41,378
- I think that's good.

614
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,180
- Really?
- Yeah.

615
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:45,115
I think that was great.

616
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,616
- That didn't feel great to me.

617
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:50,120
- No, I think...
I think we got it.

618
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:53,657
- I don't know,
that wasn't very certain.

619
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:56,293
- Have you seen my keys?

620
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:57,661
- They're in your jacket, right?

621
00:34:57,663 --> 00:35:01,698
- Yeah, I thought they were.

622
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,669
- Well, maybe they're
in your jeans or something?

623
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:06,870
- I don't know.

624
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:08,205
- On the table?

625
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,676
I feel like if we get
one more take, we'll nail this.

626
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:14,544
- You know what?
I really think that was good.

627
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,180
I really think that was
the one, man.

628
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,219
- Is everything okay, Aaron?

629
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:23,286
- Yeah, just...

630
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,754
Yeah, we're...

631
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,263
- Aaron.

632
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,565
- Yeah?

633
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,767
- Did I freak you out
with my rape story?

634
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,774
- No.

635
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:48,378
- Why are you in such a hurry?

636
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,913
- Just...

637
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:53,183
- Aaron, come here, look.

638
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:54,451
You can stay here.

639
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:56,686
I've got plenty
of comfortable beds.

640
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,588
You know, we got...
there's whiskey here.

641
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,589
It's a long drive down to...

642
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,858
- Josef, I need to go home.

643
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,760
- I know, Aaron.

644
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,195
I know you need to go home.

645
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:06,496
But what I'm telling you

646
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,698
is that we cannot find
your keys.

647
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,333
It's dark in this house.

648
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,369
Technically, you are over 0.08.

649
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:13,703
If you get pulled over
by the police,

650
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,472
you will get a DUI.

651
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:18,341
In the morning, this house'll be
flooded with light.

652
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,643
We'll find your keys.

653
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:20,877
You'll be sober.

654
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:24,447
And you can drive home then.

655
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:25,849
You understand?

656
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,427
Sorry I raised my voice.

657
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,466
- Sorry I got a little antsy
back there.

658
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,436
- That's okay.

659
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:47,871
- Yeah, I just...
I think the roads

660
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:50,407
are probably treacherous.

661
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,841
- It's a good call.
- Yeah.

662
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,777
- This is the right move.
- Yeah.

663
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:54,844
- Yeah.

664
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:56,246
- Absolutely.

665
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:57,781
- Yep.

666
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,382
Good.

667
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,990
- All right.

668
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:07,991
Here we go.

669
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:09,392
- All right.

670
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,461
Oh, it's a big one.

671
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:12,829
- Bottoms up.

672
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,898
- Bottoms up?

673
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,433
Well, all right.

674
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:17,834
If you say so.

675
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:21,771
Ah.

676
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,540
Ooh!

677
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,610
Okay.

678
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:27,811
I want to do
my final take again.

679
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:29,646
Is this thing still set?

680
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,249
- Yeah. We're good.

681
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:37,320
- So, in summation, Buddy,

682
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:40,590
I just want us...
let me start that over.

683
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,591
- You're doing good.

684
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,592
- You sure?
- Yeah.

685
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,327
- Okay.

686
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:47,297
So, in summation, Buddy, um...

687
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,970
That didn't taste weird to you?

688
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:56,006
- No, it was good.

689
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:57,507
Do you want another?

690
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:59,709
- No. I'm good.

691
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:10,320
So, in summation, Buddy,

692
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:14,791
I love you, and I miss you.

693
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,328
I'm sorry I died.

694
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,601
Just, it feels weird.

695
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,545
- Josef?

696
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:43,887
- Oh, what'd you do?

697
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:45,021
What... Aaron, what'd you do?

698
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:46,022
Why did you do that?

699
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:47,023
Aaron, why did you do that?

700
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,692
Aaron, what did you do?

701
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:49,859
What did you do?

702
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:51,361
- It's okay. Go to sleep.

703
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:53,463
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

704
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:55,145
It's okay. It's okay.

705
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,639
- Hello, Peachfuzz.

706
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,611
Mmm, Peachfuzz.

707
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,513
- No, Josef.

708
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:14,451
- Mmm, Peachfuzz.

709
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:16,686
- Josef.

710
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,388
- Mmm.

711
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,994
You should come lay with me.

712
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:28,765
I'm tired.

713
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:30,600
I love you so much.

714
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,471
I'm so sorry.

715
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:40,043
Stay up all night.

716
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,829
- Hello?

717
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:07,564
-<i> Hello?</i>

718
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:08,898
- Angela?

719
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,800
-<i> Josef?</i>

720
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,869
- No, this is Aaron.

721
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:15,738
- <i> Oh. Is Josef there, please?</i>

722
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:19,576
- He's... he's sleeping.

723
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:21,811
-<i> I'm sorry, who is this?</i>

724
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:22,912
- Aaron.

725
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,881
Your husband hired me.

726
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:26,483
-<i> What?</i>

727
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:29,118
- Your husband hired me
to film him.

728
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,020
For the cancer.

729
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,191
- <i> Where are you right now,</i>
<i>Aaron?</i>

730
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:38,027
- We're at your house
in Crestline.

731
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:39,028
-<i> You're where?</i>

732
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,030
<i>Ugh, okay.</i>

733
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:42,866
<i>Never mind.</i>

734
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:44,701
<i>Listen, I'm gonna recommend</i>
<i>that you go ahead</i>

735
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:47,937
<i>and just leave right now.</i>

736
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:49,672
- What the fuck's going on?

737
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,207
-<i> Nothing.</i>

738
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:55,578
<i>You just go ahead</i>
<i>and exit the house.</i>

739
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,646
<i>You will be fine.</i>

740
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:57,914
- Lady, I'm trying to leave.

741
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,782
I can't find
my fucking car keys.

742
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,251
- <i> Okay. That's okay.</i>

743
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:04,220
<i>Just give me the address</i>
<i>of where you are</i>

744
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:06,656
<i>and then just</i>
<i>walk out of there right now.</i>

745
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,291
<i>Just keep walking, okay?</i>

746
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,895
- Am I in danger right now?

747
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,567
-<i> My brother has problems.</i>

748
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:22,906
- Brother?

749
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:26,609
Josef's your brother?

750
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:30,880
That's...
your brother has cancer?

751
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,216
-<i> Listen to me, Aaron.</i>

752
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,419
<i>You need to get</i>
<i>out of that house right now...</i>

753
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:40,557
- Hello? Hello?

754
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,593
Shit.

755
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,133
Oh.

756
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:28,304
Shit.

757
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,401
- Death.

758
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:33,436
- It's coming.

759
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,248
There's nothing we can do.

760
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,191
I don't want to die, Aaron.

761
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,028
I don't want to...

762
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:06,369
I don't want to die.

763
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,738
Oh, Aaron.

764
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,739
Oh, God.

765
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:17,280
- I know.

766
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:19,215
- I know you know.

767
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,316
I love you.

768
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:21,317
You're such a good friend.

769
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:23,052
I love you so much.

770
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:27,890
- Josef.

771
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,795
I know.

772
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:34,831
- I know you know.

773
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:40,269
- Josef.

774
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:42,071
I know what's going on here.

775
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,743
I know you're troubled.

776
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:48,311
I'm willing to help.

777
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,316
Look, I'm not angry.

778
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:59,388
So, just give me my keys,
and we'll...

779
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,224
we'll take it from there.

780
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,163
I talked to Angela, man.

781
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,385
Josef.

782
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,188
Please let me go.

783
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:14,985
Are you gonna let me go?

784
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,170
Why are you doing this to me?

785
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:27,143
Are you... are you
just trying to scare me?

786
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:30,513
Or... okay, look.

787
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:33,182
Well, I'm terrified, okay?

788
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,384
You won.

789
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:39,422
- Now, will you just
please step aside and let me go?

790
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:43,459
Stop.

791
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:45,461
Stop it.

792
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:46,863
Stop it!

793
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:48,865
Stop it!

794
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:50,867
- Stop it!

795
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:37,173
Okay, um, so a little...

796
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:41,243
a little context here.

797
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:45,681
After our scuffle,
I don't know where he went.

798
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:47,216
He just ran off.

799
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:48,451
I, uh...

800
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:51,554
I had to get my car towed.

801
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:55,224
And now I'm home.

802
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:58,427
And, you know,
I-I thought this was over.

803
00:49:58,429 --> 00:50:00,496
I was just writing it off

804
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:04,700
as just a weird thing
that happened.

805
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:11,273
And, lo and behold,
a few days later,

806
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:16,112
I got this in the mail,

807
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:18,347
which means he knows my address.

808
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,316
That's a little disconcerting.

809
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,725
I don't know, I'm kind of having
trouble interpreting it.

810
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:33,429
I-I guess that's a...

811
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:35,531
he's supposed
to be digging a grave there

812
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:39,769
and, you know,
there's these bags.

813
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:44,807
I don't know if that's supposed
to be a body or something

814
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:48,644
in the bags that's chopped up.

815
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:52,481
Um, I don't know.

816
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:55,317
I mean,
is that supposed to be me?

817
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:56,786
Okay. You know what?

818
00:50:56,788 --> 00:50:58,187
No.

819
00:50:58,189 --> 00:51:02,591
We are just going to
get rid of this

820
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:05,327
and pretend like
it didn't happen.

821
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,700
There we go.

822
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:13,102
That's it.

823
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,141
Okay.

824
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:24,213
Maybe that's not it.

825
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:27,149
I've been having
crazy ass dreams tonight.

826
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:34,523
And it's me and Josef,
and we're at the Heart Rock.

827
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,161
Only it's a hot tub.

828
00:51:39,163 --> 00:51:41,430
And we're just...

829
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,765
we're both sitting in it,

830
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:48,170
and he's got
the Peachfuzz mask on,

831
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:49,472
and I don't think that's weird

832
00:51:49,474 --> 00:51:51,173
'cause I have one on too.

833
00:51:51,175 --> 00:51:55,845
Only mine's like a...
like a... like a baby mask.

834
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:58,481
Baby wolf.

835
00:51:58,483 --> 00:52:02,885
And we're drinking wine.

836
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:05,254
And then he leans over to me,

837
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:11,827
and he just starts
pouring the wine over my head.

838
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:16,765
And I look down
and I realize I'm...

839
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:22,671
I'm a little baby,
and he's giving me a tubby.

840
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:26,842
And there's something weird
about the water.

841
00:52:26,844 --> 00:52:30,246
I put my hand in it
and reach up,

842
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:36,152
and it's just covered in blood.

843
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:42,158
It's just a weird dream.

844
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:49,331
I got to stop thinking
about this guy.

845
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:57,406
Just heard the doorbell ring
while I was in the bathroom,

846
00:52:57,408 --> 00:53:03,179
and the delivery guy
left this on my doorstep.

847
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,283
There's no return address,

848
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:12,188
so I have a good idea
who it's from.

849
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:22,958
-<i> Hey.</i>

850
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,860
<i>So, um, just to clear the air,</i>

851
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:28,931
<i>I do want to apologize</i>
<i>for that last video I sent you.</i>

852
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:30,499
<i>It was a little manipulative</i>

853
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,034
<i>and a bit</i>
<i>of an emotional response</i>

854
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:35,471
<i>and, um, I'm sorry about that.</i>

855
00:54:35,473 --> 00:54:36,639
<i>But in all fairness,</i>

856
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:38,340
<i>I wasn't quite in my right head</i>

857
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:42,378
<i>because, well, you did drug me.</i>

858
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,513
<i>I found the empty Benadryl</i>
<i>bottle in the house</i>

859
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:50,019
<i>and, um, I got to say,</i>
<i>pretty cool move.</i>

860
00:54:50,021 --> 00:54:52,988
<i>So, the way I see it</i>
<i>is tit-for-tat,</i>

861
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:54,290
<i>no hard feelings,</i>

862
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:56,058
<i>but just in case,</i>

863
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,693
<i>I thought I'd send you</i>
<i>this little gift</i>

864
00:54:57,695 --> 00:54:58,794
<i>to clear the air between us</i>

865
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,496
<i>and make sure we're cool.</i>

866
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:02,531
<i>I'm assuming by now</i>
<i>you have the knife</i>

867
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:04,800
<i>and you have the video</i>
<i>you're watching.</i>

868
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,635
<i>But if you haven't found</i>
<i>the third element,</i>

869
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,637
<i>I would encourage</i>
<i>you to press pause now</i>

870
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,372
<i>and dig a little deeper.</i>

871
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:56,418
<i>I love wolves</i>
<i>because they love deeply,</i>

872
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,753
<i>but they don't know</i>
<i>how to express it</i>

873
00:55:57,755 --> 00:55:59,621
<i>and they're often very violent</i>

874
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:03,525
<i>and, quite frankly, murder</i>
<i>the things that they love</i>

875
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:09,565
<i>and inside of the wolf</i>
<i>is this beautiful heart.</i>

876
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:10,966
<i>And yeah, it's misguided.</i>

877
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:13,502
<i>And yeah, occasionally</i>
<i>it murders things</i>

878
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:15,504
<i>and this little wolf</i>
<i>was so cute,</i>

879
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:18,540
<i>it reminded me of you honestly.</i>

880
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,409
<i>You know, that moment</i>
<i>I scared you in the woods,</i>

881
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:21,944
<i>and it was... there was murder</i>
<i>in your eyes,</i>

882
00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:23,612
<i>but it was, like...</i>
<i>it was baby murder.</i>

883
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:25,714
<i>You're not ready</i>
<i>to accept that yet.</i>

884
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:30,052
<i>But I want to encourage you</i>
<i>to embrace your inner wolf.</i>

885
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:31,120
<i>So take the wolf.</i>

886
00:56:31,122 --> 00:56:32,654
<i>Enjoy it.</i>

887
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:36,558
<i>And more importantly,</i>
<i>take the knife</i>

888
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,993
<i>and don't be afraid</i>
<i>to murder it,</i>

889
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:41,130
<i>because when you stick a knife</i>
<i>in something</i>

890
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:45,701
<i>and you gut it</i>
<i>and you really dig inside,</i>

891
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:47,169
<i>I don't know, man.</i>

892
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:51,073
<i>There's all this</i>
<i>beautiful stuff.</i>

893
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:53,509
<i>And, um...</i>

894
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:55,631
<i>I got a little surprise</i>
<i>for you in there.</i>

895
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,182
<i>See you soon, buddy.</i>

896
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,988
- Oh, my God.

897
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:50,699
Oh, my God.

898
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,640
Oh, my God.

899
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:09,151
It's time to call the cops.

900
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:15,557
Hi. Hi.

901
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:17,125
My name is Aaron Franklin.

902
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:19,561
I'm calling to report
a violent domestic incident

903
00:58:19,563 --> 00:58:21,597
and a stalker.

904
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:27,236
Well, I don't know
if he's dangerous-dangerous,

905
00:58:27,238 --> 00:58:29,238
but he's really weird
and super creepy

906
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,808
and I'm starting
to get scared for my safety.

907
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:34,276
His name is Josef.

908
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:35,277
Or at least I think it is.

909
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:38,647
He lies a lot.

910
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:41,583
No, I don't know...
I don't know his last name.

911
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:43,085
No, I... I don't know
where he lives.

912
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:45,020
We met in a cabin
he claimed was his,

913
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:49,591
but I looked it up,
and it's just some rental.

914
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:52,728
No, I have no way of finding him
or contacting him.

915
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:55,964
Well, there must be something
you can do.

916
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:58,567
Can't you send someone over to
take fingerprints or something?

917
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:01,303
He... he sent me a heart locket
and a knife.

918
00:59:01,305 --> 00:59:04,973
You can use those.

919
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:06,808
Well, I'm glad
you're taking this seriously.

920
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,911
You guys have been
entirely unhelpful.

921
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:11,013
I'm sure I'll be
sleeping soundly tonight.

922
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:28,030
So, I'm still having nightmares.

923
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:36,171
It's, like, the same one
over and over again,

924
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:39,007
just slightly different.

925
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:58,260
Anyway, it's like we're...

926
00:59:58,262 --> 00:59:59,861
we're still in a hot tub,

927
00:59:59,863 --> 01:00:02,130
but the hot tub has,
like, these,

928
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:05,133
like, retractable spikes

929
01:00:05,135 --> 01:00:08,003
and when you sit down on 'em,

930
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:10,305
it's like they push up...

931
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:15,110
Okay. Okay.

932
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,111
Okay.

933
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,346
Okay.

934
01:00:17,348 --> 01:00:18,814
Lights.

935
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:21,249
Lights. Lights.

936
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:23,051
Lights. Lights.

937
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:35,063
Is anybody here?

938
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:41,269
Hello?

939
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,943
Josef?

940
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,150
Hello?

941
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:05,727
If there's anyone trespassing
on the premises,

942
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:09,765
let it be known I have a knife.

943
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:14,670
I'm... I'm not afraid to use it.

944
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:19,408
I...

945
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:23,879
What was that?

946
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:05,854
Josef?

947
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:17,733
Hello?

948
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:29,211
Josef?

949
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:38,220
Is there anyone there?

950
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:09,084
God damn raccoons.

951
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:37,005
The last couple nights
have been pretty normal

952
01:04:37,007 --> 01:04:42,410
until this.

953
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:44,012
This is where I sleep.

954
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:47,415
This is a broken screen
in my window.

955
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:49,885
This is not good.

956
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:52,254
All right.

957
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:10,171
-<i> Hey, Aaron.</i>

958
01:05:10,173 --> 01:05:11,673
<i>I get this, you know,</i>

959
01:05:11,675 --> 01:05:13,441
<i>you get a grave digging video</i>
<i>in the mail.</i>

960
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:14,443
<i>You throw it away.</i>

961
01:05:14,444 --> 01:05:15,944
<i>That's not a big deal.</i>

962
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:18,313
<i>Um...</i>

963
01:05:18,315 --> 01:05:21,182
<i>This was harder for me</i>
<i>to accept,</i>

964
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:24,486
<i>and this hurt me</i>
<i>because I made this for you,</i>

965
01:05:24,488 --> 01:05:27,689
<i>and it was representative of...</i>
<i>of our friendship</i>

966
01:05:27,691 --> 01:05:29,457
<i>and that bond that you and I</i>
<i>made together</i>

967
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:32,160
<i>at that Heart Rock</i>
<i>right over there.</i>

968
01:05:32,162 --> 01:05:34,429
<i>And you threw it away and...</i>

969
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,231
<i>and when I found it</i>
<i>in your trash can,</i>

970
01:05:36,233 --> 01:05:40,235
<i>I-I got my heart broken.</i>

971
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:42,370
<i>And... and if I'm honest, it...</i>
<i>it sent me</i>

972
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:44,506
<i>into a little spiral and...</i>

973
01:05:44,508 --> 01:05:48,677
<i>and I had some inappropriate</i>
<i>and wrong thoughts</i>

974
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:50,679
<i>about what I wanted</i>
<i>to do to you</i>

975
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:54,482
<i>and to myself, honestly.</i>

976
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:55,984
<i>And that was a red flag,</i>

977
01:05:55,986 --> 01:05:57,252
<i>and it scared me,</i>

978
01:05:57,254 --> 01:05:58,620
<i>and I-I thought a lot about it</i>

979
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:02,390
<i>and... and I realized something,</i>

980
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:06,461
<i>and it's that you were right.</i>

981
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,064
<i>You know, you were right</i>
<i>to throw that away,</i>

982
01:06:09,066 --> 01:06:11,199
<i>'cause we're not friends.</i>

983
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:14,669
<i>Our relationship was based</i>
<i>on bullshit and lies that...</i>

984
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,738
<i>that I made up and... and...</i>

985
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,506
<i>and I'm sorry about that,</i>

986
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:20,442
<i>and... and I want to be</i>
<i>done with it,</i>

987
01:06:20,444 --> 01:06:22,577
<i>and that's why I'm talking</i>
<i>to you today, okay?</i>

988
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:25,547
<i>This is my attempt</i>

989
01:06:25,549 --> 01:06:30,185
<i>to be real and truthful</i>
<i>and honest with you.</i>

990
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:32,520
<i>And I'm not sure</i>
<i>I'm capable of it, but...</i>

991
01:06:32,522 --> 01:06:34,489
<i>but I'm gonna try, okay,</i>

992
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:37,359
<i>to explain to you the truth.</i>

993
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:45,166
<i>And the truth is, I...</i>

994
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:46,167
<i>am...</i>

995
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:54,542
<i>The truth is, I don't know.</i>

996
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:56,211
<i>This is hard to talk about,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

997
01:06:56,213 --> 01:06:58,480
<i>I-I don't know</i>
<i>what's wrong with me.</i>

998
01:06:58,482 --> 01:06:59,547
<i>I've always done this.</i>

999
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:00,648
<i>I've... I've...</i>

1000
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:03,151
<i>I've been pretending my...</i>

1001
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:05,086
<i>my whole life and...</i>

1002
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:06,721
<i>and then there was this phase</i>
<i>where I was like,</i>

1003
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:08,423
<i>"Hey, I'll just be an actor,</i>

1004
01:07:08,425 --> 01:07:10,158
<i>because that's what actors do,</i>
<i>pretend."</i>

1005
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,259
<i>So I went headlong into that,</i>

1006
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:13,028
<i>and then, you know,</i>

1007
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:15,063
<i>it did nothing for me</i>
<i>because it wasn't real.</i>

1008
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:16,498
<i>Like, it... I could only</i>
<i>get off on it</i>

1009
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,299
<i>unless it was real,</i>

1010
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:20,468
<i>and so I saw doctors,</i>
<i>and some of them thought,</i>

1011
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:22,270
<i>"Hey," you know, "He's crazy,"</i>

1012
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:23,338
<i>and some thought not,</i>

1013
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:24,439
<i>and there were medications,</i>

1014
01:07:24,441 --> 01:07:27,275
<i>but none of that helped me.</i>

1015
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:35,316
<i>And it's led me</i>
<i>to a terrible place.</i>

1016
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:37,752
<i>I don't have any friends.</i>

1017
01:07:37,754 --> 01:07:39,654
<i>I've burned every bridge.</i>

1018
01:07:39,656 --> 01:07:42,457
<i>My sisters. My parents.</i>

1019
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:45,827
<i>I have nothing,</i>
<i>and I need somebody to talk to.</i>

1020
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:48,596
<i>And I'm hoping</i>
<i>that your kindness is huge</i>

1021
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:50,532
<i>and that, even though</i>
<i>I've burned that bridge</i>

1022
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:53,368
<i>and you have no reason</i>
<i>to trust me at all,</i>

1023
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:59,307
<i>that you will give me a chance</i>
<i>to talk to you</i>

1024
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:03,111
<i>and at the very least explain</i>
<i>myself to you,</i>

1025
01:08:03,113 --> 01:08:05,313
<i>and if you never want to</i>
<i>see me again, that's fine.</i>

1026
01:08:05,315 --> 01:08:06,748
<i>At least we'll have closure.</i>

1027
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:10,285
<i>But I'm gonna be here.</i>

1028
01:08:10,287 --> 01:08:11,419
<i>At Lake Gregory.</i>

1029
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:13,488
<i>Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.</i>

1030
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:15,290
<i>And it's a public place.</i>

1031
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:16,825
<i>It's wide open.</i>

1032
01:08:16,827 --> 01:08:19,227
<i>It's completely safe,</i>
<i>and I promise you,</i>

1033
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:22,664
<i>you don't have</i>
<i>to be afraid of me at all.</i>

1034
01:08:22,666 --> 01:08:27,702
<i>I just want a chance</i>
<i>to show you who I really am</i>

1035
01:08:27,704 --> 01:08:28,703
<i>and the truth of me,</i>

1036
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:32,207
<i>because the truth is,</i>

1037
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:34,542
<i>I am a lonely person.</i>

1038
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:38,813
<i>And I'm a sad person.</i>

1039
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:43,485
<i>And I really need a friend.</i>

1040
01:08:43,487 --> 01:08:45,820
<i>And you're the only chance</i>
<i>that I have.</i>

1041
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:04,666
- What the hell
am I supposed to do with this?

1042
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:16,918
Look at him.

1043
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:22,790
He's so sad.

1044
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:31,633
All right, Josef.

1045
01:09:31,635 --> 01:09:33,535
I'm here.

1046
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:35,336
You got me.

1047
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:37,739
But know that I'm filming this,

1048
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:40,608
and my phone is set to
speed dial to 911.

1049
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:28,676
It keeps getting better.

1050
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:32,714
I remember the first time
I watched this, Aaron,

1051
01:12:32,716 --> 01:12:34,682
and I thought to myself,

1052
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:37,652
"Okay, it was smart that you
filmed it,

1053
01:12:37,654 --> 01:12:39,487
"and it was smart
that you put your phone

1054
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:42,790
on speed dial for the cops."

1055
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:46,561
But why didn't you at least
look behind you?

1056
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:50,698
I mean, it just seemed dumb
that you would just sit there.

1057
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:56,704
And then I realized
why you didn't turn around.

1058
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:04,045
It's because you're the greatest
person that's ever lived, Aaron.

1059
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:07,915
No matter what I did to you,

1060
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:12,153
you believed I was good

1061
01:13:12,155 --> 01:13:15,089
and I would do you no harm.

1062
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:19,961
And that is why

1063
01:13:19,963 --> 01:13:23,831
I will always love you.

1064
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:28,169
And why you'll always be
my favorite

1065
01:13:28,171 --> 01:13:29,804
of them all.

1066
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:41,682
Mm-hmm.

1067
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:55,196
Okay.

1068
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:59,100
Everything's okay.

1069
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:02,703
Not a care in the world.

1070
01:14:02,705 --> 01:14:05,006
It's all over.

1071
01:14:18,888 --> 01:14:21,022
Hello?

1072
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:22,623
Yes, this is Bill.

1073
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:31,132
The job is pretty simple,
really.

1074
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:32,733
All you need is a video camera,

1075
01:14:32,735 --> 01:14:37,572
yourself,
and eight hours of your time.

1076
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:40,675
Mm-hmm.

1077
01:14:40,677 --> 01:14:42,043
Great. Great.

1078
01:14:42,045 --> 01:14:46,013
Well, I look forward
to meeting you.

1079
01:14:46,015 --> 01:14:47,648
Okay.

1080
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,610
All right,
see you tomorrow, buddy.
