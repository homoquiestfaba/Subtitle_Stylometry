00:00:29,527 --> 00:00:31,631
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

3
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:34,167
<i>You gonna be okay.</i>

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,569
I know it don't feel like it
right now.

5
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:38,337
'Cause all you feel is afraid.

6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,573
But you got me.

7
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:44,243
You didn't used to,
but you do now.

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,150
See, I was where you was
67 days ago.

9
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:52,784
Mm-hmm.

10
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:54,820
They say it's bad to count,
but..

11
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:58,857
You just get so used to it.

12
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:05,564
Sometimes I wish I was back.

13
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:08,334
I do. You'll see.

14
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:09,769
You miss things.

15
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,573
Things you never
thought you'd miss.

16
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:22,147
They say the prophet

17
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,283
wouldn't want us
talkin' like this.

18
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:26,685
'Cause you unclean.

19
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:30,722
But I'm unclean, too.

20
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:35,894
<i>I think if he
saw your suffering</i>

21
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:37,596
<i>the way he saw mine..</i>

22
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:40,766
...I think he'd understand.

23
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:47,640
He saw it
and lifted it right up.

24
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,514
You gonna be okay.

25
00:01:55,847 --> 00:01:56,849
Mm-hmm.

26
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,719
Oh, I know. I know.

27
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,558
<i>Mo, get me a cart!</i>

28
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:24,409
Beatin' up on
helpless animals!

29
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:25,745
That make you feel right?

30
00:02:25,777 --> 00:02:28,447
<i>Get outta my way.
- That is a life!</i>

31
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,681
<i>You hear me?
That's a life.</i>

32
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:31,484
<i>It's a damn dog.</i>

33
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:33,252
<i>I'm gonna tell you again
to get out of my way</i>

34
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:34,287
<i>before I move you.</i>

35
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,187
So move me.

36
00:02:40,758 --> 00:02:41,826
I'm callin' the cops!

37
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,331
Yeah, what can we do for you?

38
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:46,900
<i>Oh, wait.
Here comes the cavalry.</i>

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,402
Hey. I know you, boy?

40
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:54,239
<i>Hey, you're the Cyclops.
- Mo, just, get back inside.</i>

41
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:57,609
Hey, hey. Come on back here.

42
00:02:57,643 --> 00:02:58,844
Both of you, come on.

43
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,747
<i>A little closer.</i>

44
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:04,349
Ah! You're him, alright.

45
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:07,219
A free man.

46
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:09,788
After all this time now.

47
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,891
Tsk!
It must really be something.

48
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:17,763
<i>Hmm. You know, you got a felon
on the books here.</i>

49
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:18,763
<i>You know that?</i>

50
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:21,667
I do. But it ain't him.

51
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:24,302
Yeah. Innocent, my ass.

52
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:27,006
I don't care
what the courts say.

53
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:28,640
You know, an innocent man

54
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:30,643
<i>he don't do the things
that you did in lockup.</i>

55
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:32,544
- Can you, please,
just leave us alone?

56
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:34,581
<i>I've seen what you done
to those little girls.</i>

57
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:37,750
I've seen the pictures.

58
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:38,884
He didn't do nothin'!

59
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:42,822
That's not what I heard.

60
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:48,227
No, that's not what I heard.

61
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:08,614
<i>Not gonna make it, Mo.</i>

62
00:04:08,646 --> 00:04:10,515
Beat up too bad.

63
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:12,485
Punctured lung,
internal bleeding.

64
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,055
We gotta help him pass.
- No, he gonna make it.

65
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:18,490
He'll make it.

66
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,430
We'll give him the night.

67
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:25,730
But if he's still
suffering tomorrow

68
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:27,367
we gotta put him down.

69
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,739
Sh-shh. We're here.

70
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,507
You okay?

71
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:37,543
No, I ain't.

72
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:41,379
Don't listen to nobody.

73
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:43,615
Especially some good old boy
with a badge.

74
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:49,689
First couple months are hard.

75
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:50,722
Gets easier.

76
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:56,829
Poor thing.

77
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,980
You alone can forgive sins

78
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:17,082
so grant me forgiveness
and mercy.

79
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:28,927
<i>Thank you for your call.
You've reached Mohamed Lundy.</i>

80
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,963
Um, I'm outside right now.

81
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:34,967
So, um, you can..

82
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:38,570
<i>Hi. This is Mohamed.</i>

83
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:42,474
<i>I'm, I'm, I'm not here,
so you can leave your..</i>

84
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,613
<i>You have reached Mohamed,
and he's not here right now.</i>

85
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:49,848
<i>He's, um..</i>

86
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,403
<i>I bet you didn't sleep
last night, huh?</i>

87
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,440
<i>My first night was hard, too.</i>

88
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:52,110
<i>Beat up. Scared of the noise.</i>

89
00:06:57,915 --> 00:07:00,819
<i>They say you make it
through that first night</i>

90
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,588
<i>and you can
make it through any of 'em.</i>

91
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:08,060
<i>They got no saying
for when you get out, though.</i>

92
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,131
<i>Hold on. Just..</i>

93
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:15,867
<i>Just hold on.</i>

94
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,911
Shh. It's okay.
You're alright.

95
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:28,614
You're okay, baby.

96
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,751
You're just tired.

97
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:34,887
You're just tired.

98
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:23,703
Mohamed?

99
00:08:25,002 --> 00:08:26,872
It ain't right
what he did to that dog.

100
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,910
But it happens.

101
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:36,282
Every last one of 'em,
I wanna break their damn necks.

102
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:40,152
Ain't no rules out here.

103
00:08:40,184 --> 00:08:42,954
<i>Killed a helpless dog,
ain't nobody does nothin'.</i>

104
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,825
- Things don't get settled
the way they do on the inside!

105
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,998
Give it time.

106
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:56,067
Stuff starts to make more sense
each day you're out.

107
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,009
We should bury him.

108
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,280
- Disposal regulation.
They'll give me hell.

109
00:12:15,332 --> 00:12:16,267
Hey.

110
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:21,339
Hey!

111
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:27,846
Our drugs are locked up now.

112
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,882
Go out the way you came.

113
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:31,449
Ain't nobody
got to know about this.

114
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,288
Huh?

115
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:44,228
...Charlie

116
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:45,864
- You need help? Want me
to call you somebody?

117
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:52,037
Ma'am?

118
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,274
Whoa!

119
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,509
- Why won't you..
- Ma'am.

120
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,546
Ma'am, now,
there's a van outside.

121
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:03,414
I'll get you anywhere you need
to go if you're in trouble.

122
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:09,321
Hey, miss. Miss!

123
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:12,291
You gotta, you gotta stop here.
- You're gonna help me find him.

124
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:15,459
- I can help you
if you just..

125
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,797
- You have to help me
find him.

126
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:22,434
They didn't mean to.

127
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:23,901
- They didn't mean to.
- Hey, now.

128
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:26,838
You're scaring
me now. Don't..

129
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:29,073
Ma'am. Ma'am..

130
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:31,375
Hey. Hey, hey!

131
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:33,412
Hey. Hey. Hey.

132
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:37,115
Hey, ma'am. Ma'am, help me.

133
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:39,151
Hey, ma'am.

134
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:41,252
You alright? You alright?

135
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:43,421
Help, somebody!

136
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:50,863
Hey, I didn't..

137
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,167
...touch you,
I didn't touch you.

138
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,502
I didn't touch you.

139
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,400
<i>The lady from the Innocence
Project called this morning.</i>

140
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,235
Wanted to see how you're doin'.

141
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:41,005
Said you're doin' fine.

142
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:45,444
Workin' on your people skills.

143
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,688
You know, it strikes me
you don't seem too happy.

144
00:15:57,554 --> 00:15:59,157
To be out, I mean.

145
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,095
Most folks would be doing
backflips

146
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,131
to have their names
cleared like that.

147
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:08,633
Be outta Angola.

148
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,970
Breathin' fresh air like a real,
live person.

149
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:17,576
Bury the past.

150
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,980
Or it'll bury you, boy.

151
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:25,317
You hear?

152
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:46,638
How you doin', ma'am?

153
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,678
<i>Bismillah.</i>

154
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:44,976
Now, you need to put
that knife down.

155
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:47,412
You stay away from me!

156
00:20:47,444 --> 00:20:49,947
Get outta my way!
- I'm gonna let you leave now.

157
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,383
You need to understand
somethin' first.

158
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:53,851
- Get outta my way!
- No, you need to know..

159
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:59,990
Listen to me! Listen to me!

160
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:03,427
Listen to me, listen.

161
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:04,528
I didn't hurt you,
I didn't touch you.

162
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:06,897
I didn't touch you.
And you asked me to help you.

163
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:09,034
Understand? You understand?

164
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,902
Now listen..
- I'm not afraid of you!

165
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:13,003
- You ain't gotta be
afraid of me. No.

166
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:14,405
You get outta my way.

167
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,075
I, I, I will let you leave.

168
00:21:17,107 --> 00:21:18,842
- You get outta my way!
- I'm gonna let you leave!

169
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,078
But you, you need to know.
I didn't hurt you.

170
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:23,014
It's very important.
- Who are you?

171
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:24,783
Nobody. Hang on.

172
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:27,419
- You're one of them?
You're one of his friends?

173
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:29,887
Yeah? You're one of his friends
who watched me?

174
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,990
- Oh, we never met!
- Who are you?

175
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:34,725
I work at the shelter. Yeah.

176
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:37,895
Dog shelter. You brought in that
mutt got beat up real bad?

177
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,798
You know, in that pickup truck?

178
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,567
Charlie. Charlie, his name..

179
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:45,035
You, you know Charlie?

180
00:21:45,068 --> 00:21:47,538
- Yeah.
That's, that's your dog.

181
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,345
I'm not, it's not happening.

182
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:56,580
- Hey-hey-hey-hey.
Lady, lady, stay with me now.

183
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:58,516
No-no, I didn't watch you,
I didn't watch you.

184
00:21:58,548 --> 00:22:00,918
Just calm down now. Now breathe.
You get on.

185
00:22:03,086 --> 00:22:04,355
<i>That sound good?</i>

186
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:08,093
<i>Yeah? Alright.</i>

187
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,061
Alright.
Alright, now.

188
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:13,332
What's you name?

189
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,769
<i>You can tell me.
It's alright, it's okay.</i>

190
00:22:20,003 --> 00:22:21,972
<i>Doris.
- Doris?</i>

191
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:25,344
Doris, I'm, I'm Mohamed.

192
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:29,480
<i>We drove here?
- That's right, we drove here.</i>

193
00:22:29,513 --> 00:22:32,049
<i>I didn't know
if you was in trouble</i>

194
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:35,053
<i>somebody's after you, but I,
I just wanted to help you.</i>

195
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:36,688
<i>You asked me to help you.
- You didn't hurt me?</i>

196
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:38,123
I didn't put a hand on you.

197
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:45,063
Then what do you want?

198
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,999
Nothin'.

199
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:56,473
No. You want just some water?

200
00:22:56,507 --> 00:22:58,076
Get you some water. Yeah.

201
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:10,589
Here you go. Here.

202
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:13,657
Try it.

203
00:23:15,726 --> 00:23:18,797
It's alright, just take it.
That's it. Yeah. That's it.

204
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:20,731
That's it.

205
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:31,976
Yeah? Feel better?

206
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,083
Just breathe. Just breathe.

207
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,179
<i>Police!</i>

208
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:23,762
<i>Police! Open the door!</i>

209
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:36,106
<i>Police, open up!</i>

210
00:24:46,683 --> 00:24:48,952
Sir, we got some reports
of a domestic disturbance.

211
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:50,288
You wanna tell your wife
or girlfriend

212
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,222
or so forth to come to the door?

213
00:24:52,256 --> 00:24:54,225
- Oh, ain't nobody here but me,
officer.

214
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:57,795
- Oh, is that right?
- Martin, right?

215
00:24:57,827 --> 00:25:00,932
- You two acquainted?
- Don't you watch the news?

216
00:25:00,964 --> 00:25:02,833
- Will you open up
a little bit?

217
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:05,302
Holy shit.

218
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:08,740
Yeah, Martin Lundy.

219
00:25:08,772 --> 00:25:11,175
Hey! You mind if we come in?

220
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:14,546
Yeah, you go on.

221
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:22,252
- Is there someone else here,
sir?

222
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:25,690
- Like I said,
there ain't no one but me.

223
00:25:25,722 --> 00:25:27,192
- Well, let's just
make sure about that.

224
00:25:32,762 --> 00:25:34,898
<i>What's all the noise about,
Martin?</i>

225
00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:36,601
I was exercisin'.

226
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:38,836
<i>Going at it hard, huh? Shit.</i>

227
00:25:40,637 --> 00:25:43,340
My lovely Latina partner's
gonna take a look around.

228
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:45,242
Make sure you're not
making lampshades

229
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:47,278
outta ladies
in a back room someplace.

230
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:55,252
Doesn't look like you're big
on lampshades, actually.

231
00:25:57,922 --> 00:26:00,692
The Cyclops!

232
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:03,126
The Beast of Angola.

233
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,564
<i>You're a damn legend, son.</i>

234
00:26:08,365 --> 00:26:10,935
Tore a lotta fellows
up on the inside, huh?

235
00:26:18,174 --> 00:26:21,178
I heard even them
gang-bangin' niggers

236
00:26:21,211 --> 00:26:23,882
wouldn't go near the Cyclops.

237
00:26:29,886 --> 00:26:31,388
That's impressive.

238
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:33,958
White as you are.

239
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:37,828
Very impressive, Martin.

240
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,297
It's Mohamed.

241
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:44,134
- You're a real Movie
of the Week, aren't you, boy?

242
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:50,674
You got an animal in there,
Mr. Mohamed?

243
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:56,647
- Yeah, it's a dog from the
shelter. I'm workin' down there.

244
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,917
- We're good.
- You like dogs?

245
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,152
- I'm allergic.
- I love 'em.

246
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:02,819
Bring it out, let's see it.

247
00:27:02,853 --> 00:27:04,188
<i>I can't. She's sleepin' now.</i>

248
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:06,124
<i>Wake it up. Come on.</i>

249
00:27:06,156 --> 00:27:07,891
<i>Come on, Eric.
I'll be sneezin' all damn day.</i>

250
00:27:10,126 --> 00:27:12,630
<i>No, she needs to sleep now.
- I say, wake it up.</i>

251
00:27:15,432 --> 00:27:17,734
<i>That's a sick dog
right there.</i>

252
00:27:17,768 --> 00:27:19,804
<i>Wake it up, boy!</i>

253
00:27:19,836 --> 00:27:21,705
- She's an old dog, sir.
She's sick.

254
00:27:25,442 --> 00:27:26,411
Eric.

255
00:27:34,317 --> 00:27:36,153
You have a nice day, Mr. Lundy.

256
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:38,722
Ma'am.

257
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:57,375
Come on.

258
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,181
Come on, now.
They're gone.

259
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:10,255
I was just making dinner.

260
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:15,359
I see.

261
00:28:18,095 --> 00:28:19,396
Now, come on out.

262
00:28:21,531 --> 00:28:22,701
Come on.

263
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:00,405
Thank you.

264
00:29:08,244 --> 00:29:09,513
It's alright.

265
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:50,054
Mm, look at this.

266
00:29:50,086 --> 00:29:51,489
<i>Melanie?</i>

267
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:53,857
<i>Details are still unfolding,
but police say</i>

268
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:56,127
<i>they're dedicating all available resources.
- He was just here.</i>

269
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,095
...to the investigation
of Long's murder

270
00:29:58,127 --> 00:29:59,864
and the search for his wife.

271
00:29:59,896 --> 00:30:02,866
They do consider Doris Long
a person of interest

272
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,368
<i>and they're not ruling out
the possibility</i>

273
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:06,336
<i>that she could be a suspect.</i>

274
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:09,005
<i>Or another potential victim.
- Was she with him when he came?</i>

275
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:11,843
<i>Police say are devastated
though by Sergeant Long's loss</i>

276
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:12,943
<i>and they say
he was very well liked.</i>

277
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,278
God, I don't even know how.

278
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,545
<i>We're following
this story closely</i>

279
00:30:15,578 --> 00:30:16,880
<i>of course and will bring you
live updates</i>

280
00:30:16,913 --> 00:30:18,883
<i>as more details
become available.</i>

281
00:30:18,915 --> 00:30:21,219
<i>Hope she's okay.
- Live, here at the scene, Melanie Hebert..</i>

282
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:22,286
- Paperwork right there
for you.

283
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:23,555
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

284
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:48,846
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

285
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,584
Just keep thinking
about Charlie and.

286
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:57,154
<i>I just can't sleep.</i>

287
00:31:00,924 --> 00:31:02,527
Did you just move in
or something?

288
00:31:04,994 --> 00:31:06,463
Not a lot
of furniture or anything.

289
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:11,568
Did you have enough of it?

290
00:31:24,147 --> 00:31:25,349
I sure did.

291
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:33,557
Now, he's dead.

292
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,102
Do you want me to go?

293
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:49,073
I can go.

294
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:52,509
I don't know.

295
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,252
I don't know.

296
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,636
<i>I still wake up
and think I'm there.</i>

297
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,575
<i>With the cracks
in the ceiling.</i>

298
00:34:39,476 --> 00:34:40,510
<i>The footsteps.</i>

299
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:44,849
<i>The heavy curtains.</i>

300
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:49,219
<i>But I'm not.</i>

301
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:54,358
<i>I'm here
with these white walls.</i>

302
00:34:58,394 --> 00:34:59,663
<i>Where I can breathe.</i>

303
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,735
<i>And there are no mistakes.</i>

304
00:35:08,905 --> 00:35:10,141
<i>Just relief.</i>

305
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,338
Nobody wanted it.

306
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:43,173
Give it a try.

307
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:45,943
Want me to sit in it?

308
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:47,644
Yeah! Go on.

309
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,222
Yeah, it's nice.

310
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:01,893
Hey..

311
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:05,829
...I wanted to ask
about Charlie, my dog.

312
00:36:05,862 --> 00:36:07,664
Is he okay?
Or did he.

313
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:10,367
He probably
didn't make it, did he?

314
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,501
Yeah, he's okay.

315
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:12,836
Really?

316
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:15,773
Oh, that's great.
That's good.

317
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:19,943
I was really sure
he wasn't gonna make it.

318
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,651
Where's your dog?

319
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:29,954
- Oh, it's just for dogs
I bring home from the kennel.

320
00:36:31,288 --> 00:36:33,324
Oh. That's nice.

321
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:37,862
You finished with this?

322
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,936
Sorry.

323
00:36:56,045 --> 00:36:57,614
It's my fault
what happened to Charlie

324
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:00,951
'cause he was
trying to protect me.

325
00:37:00,983 --> 00:37:02,353
Ain't your fault.

326
00:37:07,423 --> 00:37:08,692
Your husband.

327
00:37:12,295 --> 00:37:13,897
I've known
a lot of men like him.

328
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,233
And they don't stop.

329
00:37:27,476 --> 00:37:29,779
- So, the bed in the closet,
is that for a dog, too?

330
00:37:36,353 --> 00:37:37,721
- No, that's me,
I don't really care

331
00:37:37,753 --> 00:37:39,322
too much for open spaces.

332
00:37:41,023 --> 00:37:42,592
You sleep in the closet?

333
00:37:44,327 --> 00:37:45,028
Yeah.

334
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:47,597
You fit in there?

335
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:49,900
Yeah.

336
00:38:19,862 --> 00:38:21,665
- Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

337
00:38:35,878 --> 00:38:37,614
That's better
than prison chow, huh?

338
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,720
You know, I had one of those
Nutraloafs once on a dare.

339
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,056
What you all call that inside?
Confinement loaf?

340
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:48,391
Woo! That's somethin' awful.

341
00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:53,364
You know, I always thought
it was cruel and unusual

342
00:38:53,396 --> 00:38:55,065
to put all that mushy,
wormy food together

343
00:38:55,097 --> 00:38:56,733
in a pile of shit
and call that dinner.

344
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:58,969
- What is it that you want?
- What do I want?

345
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:05,009
You don't wanna know
what I want.

346
00:39:12,081 --> 00:39:15,452
What I would like is to ask you
some questions about a dead cop.

347
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:22,425
My boss said to leave you alone.

348
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:24,027
He said that
you been through enough.

349
00:39:28,731 --> 00:39:30,768
Yeah. He and I
don't agree on much.

350
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:41,144
I'll see you soon.

351
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:08,004
Why do you do that?

352
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,413
To be clean in front of God.
Then I pray.

353
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:18,649
Sounds beautiful,
the praying.

354
00:40:19,882 --> 00:40:20,850
Thank you.

355
00:40:22,184 --> 00:40:23,520
<i>Did you grow up doing that?</i>

356
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,055
Nah.

357
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:27,757
I learned this in prison.

358
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:31,161
Why not Jesus?

359
00:40:35,798 --> 00:40:37,134
Christians..

360
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,771
...they always wanted me
to confess somethin'.

361
00:40:42,137 --> 00:40:43,740
I didn't have nothin'
to confess.

362
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:47,545
Islam never asked that of me.

363
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,016
<i>Islam. What does that mean?</i>

364
00:40:53,983 --> 00:40:55,518
It means surrender.

365
00:41:13,536 --> 00:41:14,904
Why are you helping me?

366
00:41:18,574 --> 00:41:21,511
If I get caught,
you go back to prison, right?

367
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,282
Probably, yeah.

368
00:41:26,315 --> 00:41:27,750
- Well, I don't want that
to happen.

369
00:41:30,853 --> 00:41:32,956
So, I should go.
- No, you can stay.

370
00:41:35,157 --> 00:41:36,826
You, you stay.

371
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:51,275
Okay.

372
00:42:57,873 --> 00:43:00,243
<i>My Lord,
please forgive me.</i>

373
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,082
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

374
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,677
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

375
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,795
Sorry. This... bother you?

376
00:43:53,896 --> 00:43:54,831
Mm-mm.

377
00:43:58,735 --> 00:44:00,003
You got me clothes.

378
00:44:02,472 --> 00:44:04,274
- Yeah. I don't know much
about 'em.

379
00:44:08,043 --> 00:44:09,246
It's perfect.

380
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,385
- Good. I figured
you gonna need 'em.

381
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:19,789
Thank you.

382
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,726
You're welcome.

383
00:44:25,994 --> 00:44:28,197
- If you wanna sleep in
the closet, it's okay with me.

384
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,671
- Are you sure about that?
- Mm-hmm.

385
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:37,941
Appreciate it.

386
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,483
Mr. Lundy!

387
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,985
You're a hard man
to get on the phone.

388
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:23,753
Yeah, you're a hard man to get,
in general.

389
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:29,059
Oh, it's not smart,
puttin' your back on me.

390
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:31,528
Should've learned that inside.

391
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:32,929
What's this?

392
00:45:32,961 --> 00:45:34,030
Linda, right?

393
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:36,233
- I don't have
to tell you anything.

394
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:38,068
Not sure that's true.

395
00:45:38,101 --> 00:45:40,436
This is a private business.

396
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:43,072
Unless you got a warrant,
or some reason to be here

397
00:45:43,106 --> 00:45:44,508
you ain't welcome.

398
00:45:47,577 --> 00:45:48,545
- You know why
they call him Cyclops?

399
00:45:48,577 --> 00:45:49,512
<i>Warrant.</i>

400
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:52,548
- Yeah, the Aryan Brothers
gave him that name

401
00:45:52,581 --> 00:45:55,417
when he took
his cellmate's eye out.

402
00:45:55,451 --> 00:45:58,922
Said he kept it.
17 years old.

403
00:46:00,422 --> 00:46:03,459
Monsters don't grow up, Linda.

404
00:46:03,492 --> 00:46:06,096
They just hide in the closet
until they get hungry.

405
00:46:06,128 --> 00:46:08,798
- You put a kid
in that gladiator school

406
00:46:08,831 --> 00:46:11,167
with all them animals,
what'd you expect?

407
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,003
Justice.

408
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,438
- He's peaceful now.
That's all that matters.

409
00:46:17,139 --> 00:46:18,307
- I'm just gonna
poke around here

410
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,243
and ask Mr. Lundy
a few questions.

411
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,480
I could come back
with a warrant.

412
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:29,119
- Mohamed's been through
enough, is all.

413
00:46:30,485 --> 00:46:32,054
I'm just doin' police work.

414
00:46:35,057 --> 00:46:37,894
Be quick, real quick.

415
00:46:57,079 --> 00:46:58,815
- Boss said I could
poke around a little.

416
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:06,824
You really love that right
to remain silent, huh?

417
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:14,597
Oh, come on, Martin.

418
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:18,300
You know I'm not goin' anywhere
until we have a little chat.

419
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:20,503
We could do that right here, or
we could go down to the station.

420
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:35,052
You know Doris Long?
- No.

421
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:37,353
Yeah, I didn't think so.

422
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,557
Makes sense you don't know
each other.

423
00:47:44,126 --> 00:47:47,429
The funny thing is, we lose
her trail right around here

424
00:47:47,463 --> 00:47:49,566
after the night of the murder.

425
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,235
Like someone
was waitin' for her.

426
00:47:53,135 --> 00:47:54,371
That John.

427
00:47:54,403 --> 00:47:57,340
Oh, he was not well behaved.

428
00:47:57,373 --> 00:48:00,344
A bit of a hot head,
nobody liked him.

429
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,480
Someone a girl might
wanna get rid of.

430
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:09,219
<i>Girl that felt trapped.</i>

431
00:48:09,251 --> 00:48:11,320
<i>No hope.</i>

432
00:48:11,353 --> 00:48:12,556
<i>No place to go.</i>

433
00:48:15,724 --> 00:48:17,226
<i>Friends always
lookin' the other way.</i>

434
00:48:19,628 --> 00:48:21,297
<i>Probably lasts for years.</i>

435
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:25,534
<i>Someone had
to help her, right?</i>

436
00:48:28,403 --> 00:48:30,606
Maybe someone
who didn't like cops much.

437
00:48:32,574 --> 00:48:35,678
Somebody who put a prison guard
in a coma for 2 months.

438
00:48:37,045 --> 00:48:38,214
Permanent brain damage.

439
00:48:39,548 --> 00:48:41,684
Now, you remember
that, Martin? Hmm?

440
00:48:44,286 --> 00:48:45,554
Remember his name?

441
00:48:47,056 --> 00:48:48,992
Hmm? Remember?

442
00:48:50,693 --> 00:48:53,030
Hey, I'm talkin' to you!
- That fucking pig starved me.

443
00:48:55,164 --> 00:48:56,233
There you are.

444
00:48:57,632 --> 00:48:58,601
There you are.

445
00:49:02,038 --> 00:49:04,206
His name was Ronnie.
That was his name.

446
00:49:05,074 --> 00:49:06,242
Ronnie.

447
00:49:08,443 --> 00:49:10,746
Anyway, we'll get all settled.

448
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,082
We always do.

449
00:49:42,411 --> 00:49:43,746
<i>Hey.</i>

450
00:49:45,581 --> 00:49:48,251
<i>Hmm.
- You asleep?</i>

451
00:49:52,355 --> 00:49:53,557
<i>No.</i>

452
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,159
Who are you?

453
00:49:58,427 --> 00:50:03,098
<i>What?
- I mean.</i>

454
00:50:03,132 --> 00:50:04,701
<i>Well, you wanna know
why I got locked up?</i>

455
00:50:06,168 --> 00:50:10,007
- No. No, I don't care
about that.

456
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,476
<i>I just mean,
I spend all day here</i>

457
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:16,246
<i>surrounded by
your things, and.</i>

458
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:19,081
I don't really know who you are.

459
00:50:22,117 --> 00:50:23,386
I ain't no one.

460
00:50:26,755 --> 00:50:28,625
- Well, that's not true.
I mean.

461
00:50:32,461 --> 00:50:35,664
You don't like furniture
obviously.

462
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:38,768
<i>You work with dogs.</i>

463
00:50:41,403 --> 00:50:44,775
<i>You like to pray a lot.</i>

464
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:50,079
And you're nice to me.

465
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,318
So, that makes you someone.

466
00:50:57,219 --> 00:50:58,087
<i>Right?</i>

467
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,525
<i>Don't you have any family?</i>

468
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:05,694
I got a sister, I think.

469
00:51:09,532 --> 00:51:13,336
Somewhere in Alabama
last time I heard.

470
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:15,505
Well, what's she like?

471
00:51:15,538 --> 00:51:17,840
<i>She can draw real good</i>

472
00:51:17,873 --> 00:51:19,341
<i>ever since
she was really little.</i>

473
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:21,611
Yeah?

474
00:51:21,643 --> 00:51:24,213
<i>That girl draw like
it was takin' a picture.</i>

475
00:51:25,614 --> 00:51:26,515
She'd come up with paper..

476
00:51:30,186 --> 00:51:31,755
...draw a fence or whatever
in front of her.

477
00:51:35,324 --> 00:51:38,494
And she'd hand it to me like
it was a test.

478
00:51:38,527 --> 00:51:39,829
"Now, you do it. "

479
00:51:45,768 --> 00:51:48,170
She'd hand it to me 'cause
she knew I was gonna mess it up.

480
00:51:48,204 --> 00:51:49,506
I always messed it up.

481
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:54,778
<i>That was a long time ago.</i>

482
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:57,714
<i>Long time.</i>

483
00:52:01,516 --> 00:52:02,751
<i>I have a brother.</i>

484
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:06,523
His name is Darren.

485
00:52:08,456 --> 00:52:11,760
And he's what they call
a "Tree doctor. "

486
00:52:11,793 --> 00:52:15,697
<i>And he had this big book
of different types of trees.</i>

487
00:52:15,731 --> 00:52:17,901
<i>And he would quiz me
on them, too.</i>

488
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:26,242
He was always
much smarter than me.

489
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:33,550
And better looking.
He's very handsome.

490
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:35,886
Like a movie star.

491
00:52:44,393 --> 00:52:45,461
Are we friends?

492
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:52,435
Sure.

493
00:52:53,302 --> 00:52:55,505
<i>I ain't never been</i>

494
00:52:55,538 --> 00:52:57,273
<i>been really good
talkin' to women.</i>

495
00:53:00,275 --> 00:53:02,377
They locked me up
when I was 15

496
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:04,681
and had no practicing.

497
00:53:06,248 --> 00:53:07,550
Ain't never really had a chance.

498
00:53:14,356 --> 00:53:16,492
I hope I'm gonna be okay.

499
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:27,836
<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>

500
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:23,379
Charlie?

501
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:32,888
<i>Charlie.</i>

502
00:56:35,891 --> 00:56:37,159
<i>Charlie.</i>

503
00:56:39,762 --> 00:56:41,064
<i>Charlie, here.</i>

504
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:36,246
<i>Are you okay, hon?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

505
00:58:37,646 --> 00:58:38,914
You sure?

506
00:58:39,914 --> 00:58:41,050
Thanks.

507
00:59:02,704 --> 00:59:04,039
I'm sorry. I got locked out.

508
00:59:04,072 --> 00:59:05,907
- Why are you outside?
- I made a mistake. I.

509
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,677
- Why are you outside?
- I got locked out. I'm sorry.

510
00:59:11,813 --> 00:59:13,016
Come on!

511
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,353
- I made a mistake, Mo.
I'm sorry.

512
00:59:18,387 --> 00:59:19,255
<i>What?
- She saw me, she saw me.</i>

513
00:59:19,288 --> 00:59:20,322
<i>Who?
- She's gonna call the.</i>

514
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:22,892
Your neighbor. She's, she
looked right at my face.

515
00:59:22,925 --> 00:59:25,760
- Why did you go outside?
- I don't know, I don't know!

516
00:59:25,793 --> 00:59:27,228
I thought I saw Charlie. Okay?
- What?

517
00:59:27,262 --> 00:59:28,831
<i>I thought I saw him, but.</i>

518
00:59:28,864 --> 00:59:31,367
I swear to God, I thought
I saw him outside!

519
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,202
<i>What?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.</i>

520
00:59:33,235 --> 00:59:35,104
I'm sorry, I ruined it.
I ruined it.

521
00:59:35,971 --> 00:59:36,905
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

522
00:59:40,175 --> 00:59:42,111
The cops are at my work.

523
00:59:42,143 --> 00:59:44,079
Here, they're comin'.

524
00:59:46,014 --> 00:59:47,049
It's okay.

525
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:50,685
Okay. I'm gonna have to go.

526
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:52,121
Because if
they catch you here

527
00:59:52,153 --> 00:59:54,222
I know they'll put you
back away.

528
00:59:54,255 --> 00:59:55,958
- Hold on. Hold on.
- If they catch you here, they could take you back.

529
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:57,259
- Listen to me.
- And I don't want you to go back!

530
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:58,994
- Listen.
Listen, I ain't goin' back.

531
00:59:59,027 --> 01:00:00,061
And you're not gonna
turn yourself in, okay?

532
01:00:00,094 --> 01:00:01,663
- I'm not?
- No.

533
01:00:01,697 --> 01:00:02,765
No, no, no.

534
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:05,634
I don't, I don't wanna go back.

535
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:06,969
- I know!
- I'm not talkin' about prison.

536
01:00:07,001 --> 01:00:08,269
I ain't sayin' that.

537
01:00:08,302 --> 01:00:09,771
I don't wanna go back.

538
01:00:11,005 --> 01:00:12,007
You understand?

539
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:14,976
Me neither.

540
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:16,679
Okay?

541
01:00:16,711 --> 01:00:18,648
Alright. Okay.

542
01:00:20,715 --> 01:00:23,251
I know somebody.
I know somebody's gonna help us.

543
01:00:24,186 --> 01:00:25,388
- Okay.
- Yeah?

544
01:00:28,222 --> 01:00:29,358
Go get your stuff.

545
01:00:30,992 --> 01:00:32,293
- Okay.
- Go get your stuff.

546
01:03:29,938 --> 01:03:30,873
Back up! Back up!

547
01:03:36,911 --> 01:03:37,913
How many with you?

548
01:03:38,646 --> 01:03:40,882
Just her.

549
01:03:40,916 --> 01:03:42,885
<i>I saw somethin'
in the trees.</i>

550
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:43,820
It's just us.

551
01:03:48,023 --> 01:03:50,459
<i>As-Salamu Alaikum.</i>

552
01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:52,394
<i>Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.</i>

553
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:02,103
You're a whole lot more paranoid
than I remember.

554
01:04:04,672 --> 01:04:06,341
You don't remember much.

555
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,414
- You wanna put
the gun down now?

556
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,918
More than anything, brother.

557
01:04:16,952 --> 01:04:18,387
More than anything.

558
01:04:26,027 --> 01:04:27,328
Come in.

559
01:04:27,362 --> 01:04:30,231
Mm-mm. No. Absolutely not.

560
01:04:30,264 --> 01:04:32,067
<i>I wouldn't ask you if.
- If what?</i>

561
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:33,902
If you actually cared
about protecting my way of life?

562
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,070
No. If I had other options.

563
01:04:35,103 --> 01:04:36,538
- You bring a murderer
into my home

564
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:39,275
and ask me to risk my life,
my freedom!

565
01:04:39,307 --> 01:04:42,543
Not just sheltering her, but
taking you across the border?

566
01:04:42,577 --> 01:04:45,147
Why not North? Most of that
border is just a wire fence.

567
01:04:45,179 --> 01:04:47,248
- 'Cause they're gonna find us
there, and you know that.

568
01:04:47,282 --> 01:04:48,651
I'm not askin' you
to get us across.

569
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:51,186
I'm just askin' you to get us
to someone who can.

570
01:04:51,219 --> 01:04:52,521
Who?

571
01:04:52,554 --> 01:04:54,088
- Those Low Riders
from Corpus Christi.

572
01:04:54,121 --> 01:04:56,257
You did business with them.
They move things.

573
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:59,028
- Yeah. Heard those charmers
did Crispy Black real bad.

574
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,461
Cut him up
like a fucking carrot cake.

575
01:05:00,494 --> 01:05:03,097
It's just yard gossip, man.

576
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:05,300
Low Riders are punks.
Brotherhood errand boys.

577
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:06,434
You know that.

578
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:10,306
How you gonna pay 'em?

579
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:15,677
Oh, I'm gonna pay 'em.

580
01:05:19,014 --> 01:05:21,383
- Look, I'm callin' in
my favor right now.

581
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:22,985
<i>We can't make it across
on our own.</i>

582
01:05:23,018 --> 01:05:24,552
<i>Too many people
lookin' for us.</i>

583
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:38,099
Why don't I just take you?

584
01:05:38,132 --> 01:05:40,168
- You been havin' much luck
at the border these days?

585
01:05:43,371 --> 01:05:44,572
Fair enough.

586
01:05:56,451 --> 01:05:57,586
Okay.

587
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:01,623
- Okay?
- Yeah, what?

588
01:06:01,655 --> 01:06:03,224
You want me to say it twice?
- Yeah.

589
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:17,639
<i>I don't know, man. It was his
purity that I admired most.</i>

590
01:06:17,672 --> 01:06:18,572
The way he never gave up.

591
01:06:22,443 --> 01:06:26,047
Livin' alone
for all those years in caves?

592
01:06:26,081 --> 01:06:29,151
Cold-ass nights
in the desert? Ah.

593
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:32,454
<i>Only ever wanting one thing.</i>

594
01:06:32,487 --> 01:06:35,023
<i>One thing. And riskin'</i>

595
01:06:35,056 --> 01:06:36,391
<i>dedicating
his whole life to it.</i>

596
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:38,027
Like Sisyphus.

597
01:06:38,059 --> 01:06:40,228
Rolling that fuckin' boulder
up the hill

598
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:42,164
just to watch it
roll back down.

599
01:06:42,197 --> 01:06:43,499
Drove me to tears, bro.

600
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:46,567
You know

601
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:50,372
in a way, Wile E. Coyote taught
me more about loss

602
01:06:50,405 --> 01:06:52,675
and righteousness, in a way
that prison never could.

603
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:57,311
But that fuckin' Road Runner.

604
01:06:57,344 --> 01:07:00,314
<i>That stupid, ostrich-looking
little piece of shit</i>

605
01:07:00,347 --> 01:07:03,217
with that stupid
smile and that noise.

606
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:04,787
Always fucking with him.

607
01:07:06,253 --> 01:07:08,190
I liked him!

608
01:07:08,222 --> 01:07:10,659
He was always happy, even though

609
01:07:10,692 --> 01:07:12,226
he was being chased
by some maniac

610
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:14,396
who always
wanted to kill him.

611
01:07:14,429 --> 01:07:17,599
- Yeah, easy to be happy
when you win all the time.

612
01:07:19,634 --> 01:07:21,469
- Surviving and winning aren't
the same thing.

613
01:07:25,539 --> 01:07:26,775
You got a smart one here.

614
01:07:29,244 --> 01:07:30,778
<i>Hey.</i>

615
01:07:30,811 --> 01:07:33,081
I heard from Akasha.
- No.

616
01:07:33,114 --> 01:07:35,783
- My, my brother-in-law said
he, uh, came to Brooklyn

617
01:07:35,817 --> 01:07:37,552
lookin' for work or a girlfriend
or some shit.

618
01:07:39,887 --> 01:07:42,257
Is he still cross-eyed?

619
01:07:42,289 --> 01:07:44,326
Who's Akasha?

620
01:07:44,358 --> 01:07:46,661
- So, Akasha, this poor
fucker used to get in trouble

621
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:47,796
with the screws all the time

622
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:48,797
because they could never
tell if he was

623
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:50,431
lookin' at them or not.

624
01:07:50,465 --> 01:07:52,367
Drove 'em fuckin' apeshit.

625
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,269
So, one day, to fuck with him

626
01:07:55,302 --> 01:07:56,771
me and a few brothers
told him that

627
01:07:56,804 --> 01:08:00,108
if he got hit real hard, it
might straighten out his eyes.

628
01:08:00,141 --> 01:08:02,376
And he's not too smart,
so he believed it.

629
01:08:02,409 --> 01:08:03,878
<i>Kid was fuckin' desperate.</i>

630
01:08:03,911 --> 01:08:07,281
So, naturally, we told him to go
get the Cyclops to hit him

631
01:08:07,315 --> 01:08:09,384
because this motherfucker
was a terror.

632
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:11,586
I mean, Aryans wouldn't
even sneeze at him.

633
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:13,454
- Khalil.
- What? Come on.

634
01:08:13,487 --> 01:08:14,722
The past is the past.

635
01:08:14,755 --> 01:08:17,559
So, he goes up to this brother

636
01:08:17,591 --> 01:08:19,561
<i>and starts shovin' him
at chow, you know?</i>

637
01:08:21,195 --> 01:08:22,131
<i>And this was before
brother Mohamed</i>

638
01:08:22,163 --> 01:08:23,532
<i>become brother Mohamed.</i>

639
01:08:23,564 --> 01:08:24,732
<i>When he was still
breakin' bones</i>

640
01:08:24,765 --> 01:08:26,467
<i>like a fuckin' ogre
in a kids story.</i>

641
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:28,604
<i>Khalil.
- So, he starts shovin' him.</i>

642
01:08:28,636 --> 01:08:30,572
<i>And pushin' him around.</i>

643
01:08:30,604 --> 01:08:32,740
<i>And Brother Mohamed just looks
at him like an ant.</i>

644
01:08:33,707 --> 01:08:35,409
<i>Like less than an ant.</i>

645
01:08:35,443 --> 01:08:38,280
Like a shit that an ant takes
and looks at and is like

646
01:08:38,313 --> 01:08:40,115
"Oh, that's a small-ass piece
of fuckin' shit!"

647
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:44,353
Whole place stops.

648
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:47,289
But the Cyclops does somethin'
no one ever saw him do.

649
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:54,296
He laughed.

650
01:08:57,798 --> 01:08:59,568
<i>He fuckin' laughed.</i>

651
01:09:01,435 --> 01:09:04,773
And this was huge.
Ah, a huge moment.

652
01:09:07,341 --> 01:09:09,844
It was like seeing
your dad cry or somethin'.

653
01:09:11,546 --> 01:09:13,249
<i>Somethin' you never
thought possible.</i>

654
01:09:16,251 --> 01:09:17,353
<i>He never did hit him.</i>

655
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:20,588
They almost became
kind of friends, you know?

656
01:09:22,489 --> 01:09:25,161
And brothers started passin' him
pages from the Holy Book.

657
01:09:26,694 --> 01:09:28,429
Tellin' him he didn't have
to fight anymore.

658
01:09:30,265 --> 01:09:32,568
To surrender
to the one and only.

659
01:09:35,569 --> 01:09:37,805
And just like that..

660
01:09:38,773 --> 01:09:40,809
...Cyclops was slain.

661
01:09:40,841 --> 01:09:42,777
Made a peaceful warrior
by Allah.

662
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:54,323
To friends.

663
01:09:55,523 --> 01:09:56,659
Old and new.

664
01:10:03,931 --> 01:10:05,934
It's a day's drive
to the safe house.

665
01:10:05,966 --> 01:10:09,470
Tried to make it comfy for you
back there, but it'll get bumpy.

666
01:10:09,503 --> 01:10:11,306
Shotgun in the back,
if we hit any trouble.

667
01:10:13,707 --> 01:10:16,377
When you cross, these guys will
take you to my connection.

668
01:10:16,411 --> 01:10:18,447
He'll pay 'em out
and set you up somewhere

669
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:19,880
with an umbrella
in your drink.

670
01:10:19,913 --> 01:10:21,649
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

671
01:10:21,682 --> 01:10:23,819
- Everybody. Stop thankin' me.
Come on.

672
01:10:30,457 --> 01:10:31,527
Giddy-up!

673
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:56,918
- Does he talk that much
all the time?

674
01:10:57,985 --> 01:10:58,854
Hmm!

675
01:11:01,088 --> 01:11:03,524
Yeah. He's kinda got the gift.

676
01:11:03,557 --> 01:11:05,060
Mm-hmm.

677
01:11:05,092 --> 01:11:08,296
I used to have a friend who'd do
that. We called her Chicken.

678
01:11:10,097 --> 01:11:12,000
Why? Chicken?

679
01:11:12,033 --> 01:11:14,770
She was not a chicken.

680
01:11:14,802 --> 01:11:17,805
She used to tell everybody
she was part gypsy.

681
01:11:17,838 --> 01:11:20,341
And she had these teeth
that you could just

682
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:22,377
see comin' from
a mile away.

683
01:11:24,746 --> 01:11:26,815
She was always mouthin'
off to the cops

684
01:11:26,847 --> 01:11:30,418
and get all us kids in trouble.

685
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:31,787
- Mixin' it up, huh?
- Uh-huh.

686
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,056
Then we'd have to fight.
I could fight.

687
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,792
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

688
01:11:36,824 --> 01:11:39,528
Like you care.

689
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,029
Before they'd lock me up,
I used to worry about nothing.

690
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:45,067
I never caused
too much trouble.

691
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,502
Just kept to myself.

692
01:11:48,536 --> 01:11:51,506
Just stole a couple cars, and
run 'em till they run outta gas.

693
01:11:52,873 --> 01:11:53,908
Slept wherever.

694
01:12:32,913 --> 01:12:34,483
- Before you,
there was nothing.

695
01:12:39,887 --> 01:12:40,788
It was all nothing.

696
01:13:26,134 --> 01:13:28,136
- This is it.
Stay frosty.

697
01:13:28,168 --> 01:13:29,904
<i>Welcome to nowhere!</i>

698
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:33,041
Where nothin' is your business
and nobody got no names.

699
01:13:36,144 --> 01:13:37,712
This is the precious cargo, huh?

700
01:13:37,744 --> 01:13:41,582
<i>You our guy?
- I am the guy, amigo mio.</i>

701
01:13:41,615 --> 01:13:44,118
And this is my personal liaison.

702
01:13:44,152 --> 01:13:45,520
He's a bit shy,
as you can tell

703
01:13:45,552 --> 01:13:47,087
but he does know
what he's doin'.

704
01:13:47,121 --> 01:13:48,856
<i>As does
everybody else out here.</i>

705
01:13:51,826 --> 01:13:53,161
Come on.
Let's get you all settled.

706
01:13:53,194 --> 01:13:54,863
<i>You got a long drive, manana.</i>

707
01:14:02,069 --> 01:14:04,038
We got us a live one, huh?

708
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:05,673
We ain't lookin' for trouble.

709
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,709
- Oh, but you were
sizing us up

710
01:14:07,742 --> 01:14:09,077
ever since you got
outta that truck.

711
01:14:10,645 --> 01:14:14,082
Did math on us, too, didn't ya?
How much we weigh?

712
01:14:14,114 --> 01:14:15,216
<i>Can we handle our business?</i>

713
01:14:17,551 --> 01:14:19,920
Look. We just move stuff around
down here, man.

714
01:14:19,953 --> 01:14:22,023
That's all we do.

715
01:14:22,055 --> 01:14:23,724
<i>None of us wanna go back
to a penitentiary</i>

716
01:14:23,757 --> 01:14:25,527
<i>over bullshit.</i>

717
01:14:27,662 --> 01:14:28,864
So why don't we all relax?

718
01:14:32,533 --> 01:14:34,702
And I invite you
to be our guests.

719
01:14:42,143 --> 01:14:43,612
You're good?

720
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:44,780
We're good.

721
01:15:01,628 --> 01:15:03,064
<i>Country's not really
her genre.</i>

722
01:15:03,096 --> 01:15:04,798
<i>We love those shows
around here.</i>

723
01:15:04,832 --> 01:15:06,701
<i>You see last week
when they did Disco?</i>

724
01:15:06,734 --> 01:15:08,070
<i>Kind of a guilty pleasure.</i>

725
01:15:10,203 --> 01:15:12,974
Judges ate it up.

726
01:15:13,006 --> 01:15:15,844
Even, uh, what's her name?

727
01:15:15,877 --> 01:15:19,748
With the big ol',
uh... with the hair?

728
01:15:26,854 --> 01:15:30,192
You gotta know who you are,
as an artist.

729
01:15:32,726 --> 01:15:34,194
<i>I mean, that's what they're,
they're votin' on</i>

730
01:15:34,228 --> 01:15:35,596
<i>when, when America
looks at 'em.</i>

731
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:36,965
<i>They wanna know
who that singer is.</i>

732
01:15:38,065 --> 01:15:39,733
Where he or she's been.

733
01:15:39,766 --> 01:15:41,569
<i>I wanna look into
that person's eye and go</i>

734
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:43,904
<i>"I know your story. "</i>

735
01:15:43,938 --> 01:15:45,172
<i>I can relate.</i>

736
01:15:46,908 --> 01:15:48,810
<i>That's true. I mean,
it's as simple as that.</i>

737
01:15:48,842 --> 01:15:50,645
It's the difference between
a winner and a loser.

738
01:15:51,212 --> 01:15:52,214
Honesty.

739
01:16:06,027 --> 01:16:08,896
<i>We reserved the honeymoon
suite for you all.</i>

740
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:09,865
<i>Okay. Here's the deal.</i>

741
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:13,368
Just in case
Osama didn't lay it out for ya

742
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,202
you're gonna stay
with us tonight.

743
01:16:15,235 --> 01:16:16,904
And tomorrow we are
gonna load you into the back

744
01:16:16,938 --> 01:16:18,806
of a truck
that is headed to Juarez.

745
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,208
<i>Where we are going to hand you off
to some other nice folks</i>

746
01:16:21,242 --> 01:16:23,677
<i>that are gonna get you across
to the safe house</i>

747
01:16:23,711 --> 01:16:26,847
<i>and then home
to sunny Caracas.</i>

748
01:16:26,881 --> 01:16:30,118
<i>We got some agua.
There's a working commode.</i>

749
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:34,755
<i>Hell, you got
all the comforts of home.</i>

750
01:16:34,788 --> 01:16:37,326
<i>See, when everybody plays nice,
everybody gets what they want.</i>

751
01:16:47,868 --> 01:16:49,103
<i>We'll see you in the morning.</i>

752
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:03,945
<i>Doris.</i>

753
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,149
Doris.

754
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:11,786
Ugh! No.

755
01:18:11,819 --> 01:18:12,754
No!

756
01:18:27,868 --> 01:18:28,903
Doris!

757
01:18:52,059 --> 01:18:54,061
Yaaah!

758
01:18:54,095 --> 01:18:55,197
Yaaah!

759
01:19:14,849 --> 01:19:16,150
Where is she?

760
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:19,387
Where is she?

761
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,489
In the hatch.

762
01:19:22,523 --> 01:19:24,425
Where is the hatch?

763
01:19:24,457 --> 01:19:27,494
Neon sign, neon sign!

764
01:19:27,528 --> 01:19:28,497
Gimme the keys.

765
01:19:56,524 --> 01:19:58,393
Argh!

766
01:22:11,158 --> 01:22:12,493
<i>Help me.</i>

767
01:22:12,525 --> 01:22:14,261
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

768
01:22:46,493 --> 01:22:48,496
Okay. It's okay.

769
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:51,132
- You okay?
- It's okay.

770
01:22:51,164 --> 01:22:52,533
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

771
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:54,969
Okay.

772
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,736
Aagh!

773
01:24:07,707 --> 01:24:11,478
It's okay. Come on, come on.

774
01:24:11,511 --> 01:24:13,715
Look at me, look at me. Okay?
Look at me, look at me.

775
01:24:17,217 --> 01:24:19,186
Mo? Mo, you okay?

776
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,456
Mo, you okay? You okay?

777
01:24:21,488 --> 01:24:23,757
- Just listen. That was me.
I'm sorry.

778
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:25,393
- It's okay.
- That was me there.

779
01:24:25,426 --> 01:24:28,496
I'm sorry that was..

780
01:24:28,529 --> 01:24:29,831
...that was me. I'm sorry.

781
01:24:29,863 --> 01:24:32,766
- I know. I know, I know.
It's okay.

782
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:33,668
It's okay.
- Are you okay?

783
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:34,769
I'm okay.

784
01:24:34,801 --> 01:24:37,537
We're okay. Okay.

785
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:39,807
Okay, okay.

786
01:24:55,722 --> 01:24:58,192
- How fast was I goin'?
- Shit.

787
01:24:58,225 --> 01:25:00,628
No, no, no!

788
01:25:00,661 --> 01:25:02,529
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

789
01:25:04,631 --> 01:25:06,733
Hey, we can't stop.

790
01:25:06,766 --> 01:25:07,836
We can't stop.

791
01:25:12,439 --> 01:25:13,807
Listen to me.
- Why was I goin' so fast?

792
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:15,443
- Listen to me.
We can't stop.

793
01:25:15,475 --> 01:25:18,813
Okay, listen to me,
listen to me! We can't stop.

794
01:25:18,845 --> 01:25:21,515
Look at us.
We can't stop. Okay?

795
01:25:21,548 --> 01:25:22,682
You two in the minivan!

796
01:25:22,716 --> 01:25:23,684
Pull over to the right.

797
01:25:23,716 --> 01:25:25,685
It's one car.

798
01:25:25,719 --> 01:25:27,421
Don't stop. Okay?

799
01:25:27,453 --> 01:25:28,755
- Okay.
- We're not gonna stop.

800
01:25:28,788 --> 01:25:30,925
- Alright.
- We can do it.

801
01:25:30,957 --> 01:25:33,326
Okay? I'm right here.
- Alright.

802
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:36,429
- We're gonna go. Okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

803
01:25:36,462 --> 01:25:37,431
<i>Hold on!</i>

804
01:25:39,867 --> 01:25:41,136
Go!

805
01:25:43,237 --> 01:25:44,538
<i>We can do it.
We're gonna make it!</i>

806
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:46,774
You can make it! Don't stop!

807
01:25:46,806 --> 01:25:48,842
Don't you stop. Don't you stop.

808
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:53,247
It's okay, it's okay.

809
01:25:53,279 --> 01:25:54,381
<i>We just got
to make it through.</i>

810
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:07,328
Okay.

811
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:17,372
Alright.

812
01:26:21,542 --> 01:26:23,778
Come on!
Come on. Come on.

813
01:26:24,811 --> 01:26:25,880
Come on. Come on.

814
01:26:27,914 --> 01:26:29,783
<i>You in the blue minivan,
get out of the van!</i>

815
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:31,319
No, no, no, no, no!

816
01:26:32,786 --> 01:26:34,488
We gonna run! We gonna run.

817
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,023
And we're goin' opposite directions.
- No, no.

818
01:26:36,055 --> 01:26:38,291
You realize, you gotta run as fast as you can.
- No, they'll shoot you. No.

819
01:26:38,324 --> 01:26:40,260
<i>Get out of there, right now!</i>

820
01:26:40,293 --> 01:26:41,929
- They'll shoot you.
I'm not gonna let them take you.

821
01:26:41,962 --> 01:26:43,764
- No, they ain't
gonna shoot me.

822
01:26:43,796 --> 01:26:45,465
Don't worry now.

823
01:26:45,498 --> 01:26:48,269
Just two cops. Okay?

824
01:26:48,301 --> 01:26:50,371
Ain't gonna do that.
I'm gonna find you.

825
01:26:50,404 --> 01:26:51,272
How?

826
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:57,478
- I'll find you. You know that.
I'll find you.

827
01:26:57,511 --> 01:26:59,214
Okay? Okay?

828
01:27:00,814 --> 01:27:01,782
Yeah.

829
01:27:01,814 --> 01:27:03,984
- Yeah?
Alright. You ready?

830
01:27:04,917 --> 01:27:05,886
I'm ready.

831
01:27:11,557 --> 01:27:13,527
- He's not getting out.
- This is your last warning.

832
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,696
Out of the minivan!

833
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:20,368
- Okay.
- Okay.

834
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:24,005
One, two, three.

835
01:27:33,747 --> 01:27:34,849
She's going..

836
01:27:37,451 --> 01:27:39,020
Get out of the van
and get on the ground!

837
01:27:39,052 --> 01:27:42,422
- She's my hostage.
I'm lettin' her go.

838
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:44,259
I stabbed him.

839
01:27:46,025 --> 01:27:47,927
She didn't have
nothin' to do with it.

840
01:27:47,961 --> 01:27:49,297
Get on the fucking ground!

841
01:27:49,329 --> 01:27:50,898
- I stabbed him.
- What just happened?

842
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:54,335
- I killed him.
It's, it was me.

843
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:57,038
- Look, man. Get on the ground.
Nobody has to die today.

844
01:27:57,070 --> 01:27:58,639
He's got bracelets on, man.

845
01:27:58,671 --> 01:27:59,873
You hear me? Huh?

846
01:28:08,015 --> 01:28:09,450
I surrender.

847
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:21,996
I surrender to you.
I surrender to you.

848
01:28:23,363 --> 01:28:24,898
I surrender everything to you.

849
01:28:36,009 --> 01:28:39,447
- No.
- Fuck!

850
01:28:43,449 --> 01:28:44,818
Mohamed!

851
01:29:46,913 --> 01:29:49,015
<i>I can't seem to get used
to that big clunk</i>

852
01:29:49,048 --> 01:29:50,984
<i>when the doors lock up.</i>

853
01:29:53,453 --> 01:29:54,988
<i>And all
the night noise starts.</i>

854
01:29:59,493 --> 01:30:01,996
<i>But there's this
little patch of sky</i>

855
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:05,099
<i>out my window, and I can see
clouds moving along.</i>

856
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:10,671
<i>Off to someplace
that isn't here.</i>

857
01:30:10,703 --> 01:30:13,474
<i>Someplace bigger,
where they got more room</i>

858
01:30:13,506 --> 01:30:16,509
<i>to do what they do.</i>

859
01:30:16,542 --> 01:30:18,078
<i>Clouds things, I guess.</i>

860
01:30:22,548 --> 01:30:26,086
<i>When I think of you,
it takes me away from here.</i>

861
01:30:27,654 --> 01:30:30,124
<i>Out past the place where
the clouds get off to.</i>

862
01:30:32,525 --> 01:30:36,095
<i>All I have to do is just think
about your face.</i>

863
01:30:36,128 --> 01:30:37,931
<i>And I'm out in the free world.</i>

864
01:30:39,867 --> 01:30:42,703
<i>Pressing up against the walls
of our little closet.</i>

865
01:30:43,837 --> 01:30:47,041
<i>And we're there, together.</i>

866
01:30:48,774 --> 01:30:51,011
<i>Where things don't
echo all the time.</i>

867
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:55,016
<i>I think of you.</i>

868
01:30:58,217 --> 01:30:59,554
<i>I think of you.</i>

869
01:31:01,688 --> 01:31:02,824
<i>I think of you.</i>

870
01:32:03,817 --> 01:32:05,619
- Hi.
- Hi.

871
01:32:07,087 --> 01:32:08,923
- Hi.
- Hi.

872
01:32:10,323 --> 01:32:12,993
You get my letter?
- Yeah.

873
01:32:14,261 --> 01:32:16,197
Even tried to write you
back but.

874
01:32:20,033 --> 01:32:21,168
Just came out wrong.

875
01:32:22,603 --> 01:32:24,271
- It's okay.
- Hmm.

876
01:32:26,372 --> 01:32:27,307
- You should keep
tryin' though.

877
01:32:31,078 --> 01:32:32,680
Is that a new shirt?

878
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:35,815
Yeah.

879
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:39,653
- I guess I sort of stole
your look, huh?

880
01:32:46,827 --> 01:32:47,962
Are you okay?

881
01:32:53,033 --> 01:32:56,237
You make any friends?
- Yeah, some.

882
01:32:58,971 --> 01:33:00,875
You know, there's some good
people here.

883
01:33:03,076 --> 01:33:05,279
I hear the lawyer's gonna
get you a really good deal.

884
01:33:06,846 --> 01:33:09,282
- Yeah, Vicky's...
she real smart.

885
01:33:10,984 --> 01:33:12,286
She always smell
like coconut, though.

886
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:20,360
Aw, you shouldn't be in here.

887
01:33:26,132 --> 01:33:27,801
I took a life, Mohamed.

888
01:33:30,069 --> 01:33:31,304
Wasn't mine to take.

889
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:39,212
How's our place?

890
01:33:42,282 --> 01:33:45,319
Uh... it's empty again.

891
01:33:49,221 --> 01:33:51,257
Hey, you should get a dog.

892
01:33:53,393 --> 01:33:54,729
I miss you so much.

893
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:02,402
I miss you, too.

894
01:34:12,345 --> 01:34:13,814
Come on.
Give me your head.

895
01:34:31,465 --> 01:34:32,900
Do you feel my hand?

896
01:34:34,935 --> 01:34:36,003
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

897
01:34:37,871 --> 01:34:39,206
You feel it?

898
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:42,176
I do.

899
01:35:28,921 --> 01:35:30,123
You have me.

900
01:35:32,425 --> 01:35:34,360
You didn't before,
but you do now.

901
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:39,266
I do now.
