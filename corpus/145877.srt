360
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:22,766  X1:271 X2:450 Y1:388 Y2:411

Who?

362
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:28,728  X1:274 X2:446 Y1:388 Y2:416

363
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:31,101  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:358 Y2:415
There's something wrong with me, Lucy.

364
00:30:32,773 --> 00:30:34,866  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:388 Y2:416
There's something so wrong.

[Crying]

366
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:39,712  X1:319 X2:401 Y1:388 Y2:411

367
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:41,873  X1:285 X2:436 Y1:388 Y2:416
It's OK, Mary.

368
00:30:41,915 --> 00:30:44,713  X1:197 X2:524 Y1:358 Y2:415
MARY: I've had these dreams my whole life--

369
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:47,914  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:358 Y2:410
trapped in darkness with this man.

370
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:54,721  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:358 Y2:415
I used to think they were just nightmares...

371
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:57,730  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:388 Y2:414
but this one, it was so real...

372
00:30:57,764 --> 00:31:00,255  X1:242 X2:479 Y1:358 Y2:415

I...

374
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:07,606  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:388 Y2:416

376

377

I'm not here to confess.

378
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:21,211  X1:201 X2:520 Y1:388 Y2:416
I need to ask you something.

379

All right.

380
00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:27,794  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:388 Y2:416
My mother came to this church...

381
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:30,797  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:358 Y2:410
for the last five years of her life.

382
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:33,459  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:358 Y2:415
Did she ever talk about my father?

383
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,127  X1:259 X2:460 Y1:388 Y2:416

384
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:37,262  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:388 Y2:416
Why she took me away?

385
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:39,272  X1:193 X2:529 Y1:388 Y2:416
Did she ever say what it was...

386
00:31:39,306 --> 00:31:41,399  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:358 Y2:415

387
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,238  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:388 Y2:416

388
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:47,737  X1:198 X2:523 Y1:388 Y2:416
She was afraid of something.

389
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,545  X1:265 X2:455 Y1:388 Y2:416
Spiritually afraid.

390
00:31:51,718 --> 00:31:54,016  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:388 Y2:416
She must've told you things...

391
00:31:54,054 --> 00:31:56,147  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:388 Y2:411
she couldn't even tell me.

392
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:00,490  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:358 Y2:410
She came to you the week before she died.

393
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:04,463  X1:243 X2:478 Y1:358 Y2:410
Did she confess some terrible secret?

394
00:32:07,034 --> 00:32:10,197  X1:190 X2:532 Y1:388 Y2:411
Do I have some terrible secret?

395
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,803  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:358 Y2:410
Her confession would've been confidential.

396

595
00:46:48,754 --> 00:46:51,848  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:358 Y2:410
that if Dracula could not die, then nor would I.

596
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,187  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:388 Y2:416
I would be his keeper...

597
00:46:53,225 --> 00:46:56,991  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:358 Y2:410
for as long as it took to uncover his secret...

598
00:46:57,029 --> 00:47:01,363  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:388 Y2:416
to know who he really is...

599
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,834  X1:220 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:410
and somehow find a way to end him.

600
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:08,571  X1:264 X2:456 Y1:388 Y2:411
I used his blood...

601

602
00:47:10,642 --> 00:47:13,440  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:358 Y2:413
but I never found the answer, Simon.

603
00:47:13,478 --> 00:47:16,777  X1:226 X2:495 Y1:388 Y2:416
Only this--he hates God.

604
00:47:16,815 --> 00:47:19,477  X1:231 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:415
He is repulsed by all things Christian...

605
00:47:19,518 --> 00:47:21,349  X1:256 X2:465 Y1:358 Y2:410
but these things do not kill him. No.

606
00:47:21,386 --> 00:47:26,153  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:358 Y2:415

610
00:47:37,703 --> 00:47:40,035  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:358 Y2:410
before he gets what he came for.

611
00:47:40,072 --> 00:47:42,905  X1:219 X2:504 Y1:358 Y2:410
But he's here by accident. The crash.

616
00:47:56,989 --> 00:48:01,221  X1:265 X2:458 Y1:358 Y2:410
For the first time, I believe...

617
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:07,358  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:358 Y2:410
that there is someone else in the world like him...

618
00:48:07,399 --> 00:48:11,460  X1:221 X2:502 Y1:358 Y2:410
and he senses it. He senses his own blood.

623
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:34,653  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:358 Y2:415

630
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,740  X1:202 X2:521 Y1:388 Y2:416

631
00:48:57,783 --> 00:49:00,183  X1:284 X2:438 Y1:388 Y2:411
He wants me.

632
00:49:00,218 --> 00:49:03,278  X1:258 X2:464 Y1:388 Y2:416

922
01:13:23,783 --> 01:13:27,480  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:358 Y2:410

931
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:55,946  X1:211 X2:511 Y1:388 Y2:416
Has to be something more.

932
01:13:58,084 --> 01:13:59,210  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:388 Y2:416

- Aramaic.

Aramaic?

937
01:14:08,561 --> 01:14:11,428  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:358 Y2:415

01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:59,544  X1:225 X2:497 Y1:388 Y2:416
DRACULA: release...you.

1064
01:31:02,052 --> 01:31:03,815  X1:265 X2:455 Y1:388 Y2:416
[Woman singing]

1065
01:31:20,203 --> 01:31:21,465  X1:332 X2:387 Y1:388 Y2:411
Aah!

1066
01:31:31,648 --> 01:31:33,775  X1:281 X2:440 Y1:388 Y2:416
SIMON: Mary!

1067
01:31:33,817 --> 01:31:34,875  X1:327 X2:394 Y1:388 Y2:416
Mary!

1068
01:32:08,318 --> 01:32:10,149  X1:218 X2:505 Y1:358 Y2:415
MARY: Long ago, Judas Iscariot...

1069
01:32:10,187 --> 01:32:12,621  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:388 Y2:411
tried to die for his sins...

1070
01:32:12,656 --> 01:32:14,487  X1:255 X2:466 Y1:388 Y2:411
but he was denied.

1071
01:32:14,524 --> 01:32:16,958  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:358 Y2:410
Today, the rope did not break...

1072
01:32:16,994 --> 01:32:20,452  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:358 Y2:415
and he was burned in the first light of dawn.

1073
01:32:20,497 --> 01:32:23,398  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:358 Y2:410
I am now the keeper of what remains.

1074
01:32:23,433 --> 01:32:26,231  X1:221 X2:500 Y1:358 Y2:410
If the soul of Dracula still flickers in his ashes...

1075
01:32:26,269 --> 01:32:29,261  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:358 Y2:410
I will keep it forever contained.

1076
01:32:30,841 --> 01:32:34,368  X1:212 X2:511 Y1:358 Y2:410
For the first time in my life, I know who I am...

1077
01:32:34,411 --> 01:32:37,346  X1:219 X2:502 Y1:388 Y2:416
and where my future lies.

1078
01:32:37,381 --> 01:32:39,713  X1:232 X2:489 Y1:388 Y2:416
I am Mary Van Helsing.

1079
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:42,184  X1:208 X2:513 Y1:388 Y2:416
I am my father's daughter...

1080
01:32:42,219 --> 01:32:44,710  X1:224 X2:497 Y1:358 Y2:415
and nothing can ever take that away.

1081
01:32:44,755 --> 01:32:47,315  X1:305 X2:415 Y1:388 Y2:414
[Thunder]

1082
01:33:06,207 --> 01:33:11,144  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:358 Y2:415
SINGING: I cannot take this anymore

1083
01:33:11,179 --> 01:33:15,548  X1:259 X2:462 Y1:358 Y2:410
Saying everything I've said before

1084
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:18,143  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:358 Y2:415
All these words, they make no sense

1085
01:33:18,186 --> 01:33:20,620  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:388 Y2:416
I found bliss in ignorance

1086
01:33:20,655 --> 01:33:23,123  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:358 Y2:415
The less I hear, the less you say

1087
01:33:23,157 --> 01:33:26,388  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:388 Y2:416
You'll find that out anyway

1088
01:33:26,427 --> 01:33:29,794  X1:273 X2:446 Y1:388 Y2:411
Just like before

1089
01:33:29,831 --> 01:33:31,799  X1:220 X2:502 Y1:388 Y2:416
Everything you say to me

1090
01:33:31,833 --> 01:33:33,698  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:415
Takes me one step closer to the edge

1091
01:33:33,735 --> 01:33:35,134  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:388 Y2:411
And I'm about to break

1092
01:33:35,169 --> 01:33:36,796  X1:257 X2:464 Y1:358 Y2:410
I need a little room to breathe

1093
01:33:36,838 --> 01:33:38,806  X1:251 X2:469 Y1:358 Y2:415
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge

1094
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:40,273  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:388 Y2:411
And I'm about to break

1095
01:33:40,308 --> 01:33:45,075  X1:261 X2:460 Y1:358 Y2:410
I find the answers aren't so clear

1096
01:33:45,113 --> 01:33:49,675  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:358 Y2:415
Wish I could find a way to disappear

1097
01:33:49,717 --> 01:33:52,311  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:358 Y2:415
All these thoughts, they make no sense

1098
01:33:52,353 --> 01:33:54,844  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:388 Y2:416
I found bliss in ignorance

1099
01:33:54,889 --> 01:33:57,255  X1:212 X2:511 Y1:388 Y2:416
Nothing seems to go away

1100
01:33:57,292 --> 01:34:00,420  X1:248 X2:472 Y1:388 Y2:416
Over and over again

1101
01:34:00,461 --> 01:34:03,828  X1:273 X2:446 Y1:388 Y2:411
Just like before

1102
01:34:03,865 --> 01:34:05,765  X1:220 X2:502 Y1:388 Y2:416
Everything you say to me

1103
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,700  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:358 Y2:415
Takes me one step closer to the edge

1104
01:34:07,735 --> 01:34:09,134  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:388 Y2:411
And I'm about to break

1105
01:34:09,170 --> 01:34:10,933  X1:257 X2:464 Y1:358 Y2:410
I need a little room to breathe

1106
01:34:10,972 --> 01:34:12,803  X1:251 X2:469 Y1:358 Y2:415
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge

1107
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:13,966  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:388 Y2:411
And I'm about to

1108
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:17,609  X1:325 X2:395 Y1:388 Y2:411
Shout

1109
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:26,944  X1:325 X2:397 Y1:388 Y2:416
Heavy

1110
01:34:26,988 --> 01:34:28,319  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:388 Y2:416
You want it heavy

1111
01:34:28,356 --> 01:34:29,789  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:388 Y2:416
Welcome to my world

1112
01:34:29,824 --> 01:34:32,019  X1:251 X2:472 Y1:358 Y2:415
Feel the weight of it grinding down

1113
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:34,051  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:388 Y2:416
And heavy

1114
01:34:34,095 --> 01:34:35,289  X1:277 X2:443 Y1:388 Y2:416
I want it heavy

1115
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:36,854  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:388 Y2:416
Welcome to my world

1116
01:34:36,898 --> 01:34:41,801  X1:246 X2:475 Y1:358 Y2:415
Feel the weight of it grinding down again

1117
01:34:44,072 --> 01:34:46,870  X1:305 X2:416 Y1:388 Y2:411
Shook off

1118
01:34:46,908 --> 01:34:48,876  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:358 Y2:415
Gather your pathetic masses

1119
01:34:48,910 --> 01:34:50,207  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:388 Y2:416
And bring them to me

1120
01:34:50,244 --> 01:34:52,303  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:388 Y2:416
To a world devoid of light

1121
01:34:52,347 --> 01:34:55,578  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:358 Y2:415
To another time, to another place

1122
01:34:55,617 --> 01:34:58,586  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:358 Y2:415
And then the broken ones taste my misery

1123
01:34:58,620 --> 01:35:01,248  X1:235 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:415
Rip away the disguise, and you will realize

1124
01:35:01,289 --> 01:35:03,985  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:358 Y2:415
That you find the truth is sickening

1125
01:35:04,025 --> 01:35:07,017  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:358 Y2:415
We don't need to change it, really

1126
01:35:07,061 --> 01:35:10,758  X1:256 X2:465 Y1:388 Y2:416
I kind of like it ugly

1127
01:35:10,798 --> 01:35:12,789  X1:340 X2:382 Y1:388 Y2:416
Lay

1128
01:35:12,834 --> 01:35:14,358  X1:351 X2:369 Y1:398 Y2:421
It

1129
01:35:14,402 --> 01:35:16,267  X1:328 X2:392 Y1:388 Y2:411
Make

1130
01:35:16,304 --> 01:35:18,295  X1:307 X2:413 Y1:388 Y2:416
It binding

1131
01:35:18,339 --> 01:35:20,204  X1:309 X2:411 Y1:388 Y2:416
Seething

1132
01:35:20,241 --> 01:35:21,936  X1:315 X2:407 Y1:388 Y2:416
Blinding

1133
01:35:21,976 --> 01:35:23,568  X1:299 X2:421 Y1:388 Y2:416
Screaming

1134
01:35:23,611 --> 01:35:25,238  X1:325 X2:397 Y1:388 Y2:416
Heavy

1135
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:26,712  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:388 Y2:416
You want it heavy

1136
01:35:26,748 --> 01:35:28,978  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:358 Y2:415
Welcome to my world, grinding down

1137
01:35:29,017 --> 01:35:30,814  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:388 Y2:416
And heavy

1138
01:35:30,852 --> 01:35:32,410  X1:277 X2:443 Y1:388 Y2:416
I want it heavy

1139
01:35:32,453 --> 01:35:35,013  X1:251 X2:472 Y1:358 Y2:415
Feel the weight of it grinding

1140
01:35:35,056 --> 01:35:36,546  X1:325 X2:397 Y1:388 Y2:416
Heavy

1141
01:35:36,591 --> 01:35:39,355  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:388 Y2:416
You want it heavy

1142
01:35:39,394 --> 01:35:42,124  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:388 Y2:416
You want it heavy

1143
01:35:42,163 --> 01:35:43,824  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:388 Y2:416
You want it heavy
