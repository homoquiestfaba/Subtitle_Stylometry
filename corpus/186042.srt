1
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:41,715
Your butt is wide, well mine is too
Just watch your mouth or I’ll sit on you

2
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:49,915
The word is out, better treat me right
’cause I’m the king of cellulite

3
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:55,465
Ham on, ham on, ham on whole wheat, all right

4
00:01:58,913 --> 00:02:06,442
My zippers bust, my buckles break
I’m too much man for you to take

5
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:14,609
The pavement cracks when I fall down
I’ve got more chins than chinatown

6
00:02:15,374 --> 00:02:19,117
Well, I’ve never used a phone booth
And I’ve never seen my toes

7
00:02:19,117 --> 00:02:23,190
When I’m goin’ to the movies
I take up seven rows

8
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,375
Because I’m fat, I’m fat, come on
(fat, fat, really really fat)

9
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:31,570
You know I’m fat, I’m fat, you know it
(fat, fat, really really fat)

10
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,885
You know I’m fat, I’m fat, come on you know
(fat, fat, really really fat)

11
00:02:35,885 --> 00:02:40,524
Don’tcha call me pudgy, portly or stout
Just now tell me once again who’s fat

12
00:02:47,562 --> 00:03:00,192
When I walk out to get my mail
It measures on the richter scale
Down at the beach I’m a lucky man

13
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:04,186
I’m the only one who gets a tan

14
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:12,352
If I have one more pie a la mode
I’m gonna need my own zip code

15
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:16,552
When you’re only having seconds
I’m having twenty-thirds

16
00:03:16,552 --> 00:03:20,583
When I go to get my shoes shined
I gotta take their word

17
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:24,685
Because I’m fat, I’m fat, sha mone
(fat, fat, really really fat)

18
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:28,917
You know I’m fat, I’m fat, you know it
(fat, fat, really really fat)

19
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:33,332
You know I’m fat, I’m fat, you know it you know
(fat, fat, really really fat)

20
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:38,362
And my shadow weighs forty-two pounds
Lemme tell you once again who’s fat

21
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:57,755
If you see me comin’ your way
Better give me plenty space

22
00:03:57,755 --> 00:04:01,843
If I tell you that I’m hungry
Then won’t you feed my face

23
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:06,144
Because I’m fat, I’m fat, come on
(fat, fat, really really fat)

24
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:09,957
You know I’m fat, I’m fat, you know it
(fat, fat, really really fat)

25
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:14,466
You know I’m fat, I’m fat, you know it, you know
(fat, fat, really really fat)

26
00:04:14,673 --> 00:04:18,338
Woo woo woo, (when I sit around the house
I really sit around the house)

27
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:22,335
You know I’m fat, I’m fat, come on
(fat, fat, really really fat)

28
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:26,871
You know I’m fat, I’m fat, you know it, you know it
(fat, fat, really really fat)

29
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:31,017
You know, you know, you know, come on
(fat, fat, really really fat)

30
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:34,645
And you know all by myself I’m a crowd
Lemme tell you once again

31
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:38,888
You know I’m huge, I’m fat, you know it
(fat, fat, really really fat)

32
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:43,023
You know I’m fat, you know, (hoo)
(fat, fat, really really fat)

33
00:04:42,968 --> 00:04:47,365
You know I’m fat, I’m fat, you know it, you know
(fat, fat, really really fat)

34
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:52,359
And the whole world knows I’m fat and I’m proud
Just tell me once again who’s fat
