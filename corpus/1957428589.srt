1
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,002
- Okay, Jason's late.

2
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:22,836
Jason's late.

3
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:25,646
Nico, how old are you now?

4
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:28,652
- Almost 25.

5
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:30,383
- Right.

6
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:32,923
So you know your mother met
someone that she really loves.

7
00:01:32,923 --> 00:01:35,195
And I'm telling you,
learn a lesson from me.

8
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,348
Do not come between two
people in love, don't do it.

9
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,384
You can succeed in breaking
people up, but it's bad.

10
00:01:42,222 --> 00:01:44,594
It's very bad.

11
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:46,727
Don't even try.

12
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:47,627
All right.

13
00:01:47,627 --> 00:01:48,460
Oh, Mrs. Clarke.

14
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,459
Where's Jason?

15
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:54,204
Nico, just make sure there's
no crap on the carpet.

16
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:56,897
John, how are we doing over here?

17
00:01:56,897 --> 00:01:58,428
Everything's ready to go.

18
00:01:58,428 --> 00:01:59,309
Where's Carl?

19
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:00,410
- Yeah, where is Carl?

20
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,262
I hope he's at an audition.

21
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:03,243
Did you see Hamlet?

22
00:02:03,243 --> 00:02:04,732
- I, I did, yeah.

23
00:02:04,732 --> 00:02:06,787
- Look at that.
- Yeah.

24
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:09,880
Isn't he the most
handsome man you've ever seen?

25
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,531
He's very handsome.

26
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:15,365
- Yeah, his looks do a lot of
work for him, let me tell you.

27
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:16,199
Anyway.

28
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,790
If Jason fucks us over,
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

29
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,580
He's willing to work for
$40 a day, so it was like,

30
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,531
"All right, great."

31
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:28,338
This is Nico's first day on any film shoot

32
00:02:28,338 --> 00:02:30,547
and we wanna get them turned on, okay?

33
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:33,558
I'm not a good housekeeper.

34
00:02:33,558 --> 00:02:34,392
- Should I-

35
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:35,395
- Just straighten it out a little bit.

36
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:37,067
We don't want people looking at on-screen

37
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:39,409
and paying attention to
wrinkles on the bed, right,

38
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,551
- we want them to look at Jason.
- Okay.

39
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:44,094
- You know, Andy moved
into the Chelsea, right?

40
00:02:44,094 --> 00:02:45,075
He couldn't handle it,

41
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:47,257
he just didn't fit in.

42
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:49,089
He tried to have a fabulous party

43
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:50,600
and bring all his little friends,

44
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,773
and it just wasn't right.

45
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,476
There's something phony there.

46
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:55,615
- With Andy or the-
- Yeah, with Andy

47
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:59,079
Jonas can't stand him and
Brakhage hates him too.

48
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,270
The boys!

49
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,125
Get, get John a cup of coffee, will you?

50
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,526
- How do you like it? Black?

51
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:07,007
Sugar.

52
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:10,120
- All right. Plan C.

53
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,202
We go home.

54
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:14,144
- No, we'll do your story.

55
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:14,978
Nico, have a seat.

56
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:16,256
I'm the director.

57
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:17,217
Or we could reschedule.

58
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:19,129
No, no, no.

59
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:21,832
- Rolling.
- Okay, Nico, go.

60
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:22,726
What do you love?

61
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:25,472
- Um...

62
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,939
I love, I love, um,

63
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:29,981
when, when my family-

64
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:31,772
- Get, get the door.

65
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:35,605
- Hey.
- Hey.

66
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:36,879
- Hey.
- Saul!

67
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,100
How are yoU?
- I, I should have remembered

68
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,473
you have to go outside to get inside here.

69
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:42,032
You can never get used to it,

70
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:44,504
it's called cockamamie
crazy maze craziness.

71
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:46,136
Hello, sorry,

72
00:03:46,136 --> 00:03:47,387
is this guy okay?

73
00:03:47,387 --> 00:03:48,839
Oh, come on, we've
done three films together.

74
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:49,672
- Oh good. Okay, well then it's fine.

75
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:51,601
- He did "Cool World,"
he did "The Connection."

76
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:53,413
- Well, then I'm a big fan of yours.

77
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:54,247
That's right.

78
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:55,081
- I'm a big fan of hers.

79
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:56,156
- This is Nico.
- Hey.

80
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:57,197
- You want some coffee?

81
00:03:57,197 --> 00:03:58,705
- Yeah, I'm fine,

82
00:03:58,705 --> 00:03:59,539
'cause I know I'm running a little late.

83
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,047
Okay. So,
John, can you help him?

84
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:02,672
- Oh, I see that you it to set up already.

85
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:04,384
I got some stuff coming, it's, you know...

86
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:06,096
The Porter will bring it
up as soon as he's there.

87
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:07,988
And maybe we can fill
in back a little bit.

88
00:04:07,988 --> 00:04:09,409
It's just too shadowy.

89
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:11,141
You know what I mean is I
just don't like this look,

90
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:12,432
you know, it's just like,

91
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:14,524
it looks like some sort of
cheap photography studio

92
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:15,358
or something like that, you know?

93
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:16,192
I want to fill it out.

94
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:17,597
You know, if we're gonna have shadows,

95
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:19,052
I want conscious shadows.
- He's not there.

96
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:20,610
He's not answering.
- I want something with

97
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,033
a blend and a tact to it, you know, some..

98
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:24,948
That's just like, that's cheap.

99
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:28,458
I'm so glad we're finally
working together, you know?

100
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,343
I'm just from the Grand Concourse.

101
00:04:30,343 --> 00:04:31,624
You know what I mean?

102
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:32,458
And you-

103
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,831
- Yeah, but you worked at MGM! Come on!

104
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:35,295
- But you come from different people.

105
00:04:35,295 --> 00:04:38,478
You are a princess.
- Thank you, Saul.

106
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,199
- You are an Academy
Award winning princess.

107
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,191
- Yeah, it's right over there.

108
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:43,180
You ever seen a real Oscar before?

109
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,551
Oh yeah.

110
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:47,297
For a potato troll like me
to be working for someone

111
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:48,131
from your background-

112
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:49,990
What kind of subject is this?

113
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,691
I mean, I'm a little-
- Well, you know-

114
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,833
- I'm a little shocked
that you're shooting

115
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,666
in your living room.
- Do you know I've been doing

116
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,500
for the last few year?

117
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,536
- Well, I mean, I've seen the
Robert Frost film of course,

118
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:59,229
you know, I love Robert Frost.
- Oh okay.

119
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:00,460
Just listen for a second.

120
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,394
I wanna explain to you
what we're doing here

121
00:05:01,394 --> 00:05:02,818
so that you understand.

122
00:05:02,818 --> 00:05:03,931
- Okay please, I'm, I'm listening.

123
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:04,852
I'm listening.
- Okay. First I thought,

124
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:06,957
"Well, what's the most important
issue going on in America?"

125
00:05:06,957 --> 00:05:08,839
It's the race issue.
- Oh yeah.

126
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,810
- My last two films have
been about black people

127
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,512
and this film is gonna be that too.

128
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,346
- Oh, I see.

129
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,916
Now I understand this.

130
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,517
So I'm not going to change anything.

131
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,351
I get what what you're going after.

132
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,040
- Okay, you guys, can you just get set?

133
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,131
Thanks, I've gotta call Carl.
- Yeah, if it's gonna be

134
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:22,305
like this I'll just
leave it the way it is.

135
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:23,139
- Nico.
- Yes?

136
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:24,344
- So is this your first shoot?

137
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:26,106
- This is my first shoot.

138
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:26,940
- Fantastic!

139
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,294
Okay, you're going places.

140
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,840
Go ahead and sit down there,

141
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,800
we'll work a focus with you.

142
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,793
You're gonna be a stand-in, okay?

143
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:36,286
- Okay, have a seat.
- Thank you.

144
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:37,287
- You're cute, Nico.

145
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:39,389
You're a good looking guy.

146
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:41,734
The question is, are you
going to be a nice guy?

147
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:46,189
So Nico,

148
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,382
what's your plan?

149
00:05:51,056 --> 00:05:53,143
Are, are we, are
we working or are we just-

150
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:54,584
- This is stupid. This is stupid.

151
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:55,511
Yeah, I, I...

152
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:56,345
- Let me call Carl again.

153
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:58,982
- You know, you're in
a privileged position.

154
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:03,503
We'll figure it out.
- Thank you.

155
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:11,641
You want a Hydrox cookie?

156
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:12,936
Like when were kids?

157
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:17,287
I shouldn't be having
cookies, actually.

158
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:18,121
- What's that?

159
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:19,619
- Black guys, black guys who's
trying to pass for white?

160
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:20,921
We call them one of these.

161
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:22,902
- Hydrox cookie?

162
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:31,231
Never fear.

163
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:32,615
- Jason's here! Whoo!
- Jason!

164
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,327
Hun.
- Hey, baby?

165
00:06:36,548 --> 00:06:37,382
- How are you?

166
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:39,069
- Swinging pad you got here.

167
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:40,565
- You forgot my stuff.

168
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:44,834
- Who's this crazy cat?

169
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,456
- This is Jason, our star.

170
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:48,448
- Ooh, who's this crazy cat?

171
00:06:48,448 --> 00:06:51,611
That's some hot chicken
you got cooking, baby!

172
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,303
Pleased to meet you.

173
00:06:53,303 --> 00:06:54,137
Nico.

174
00:06:54,137 --> 00:06:56,746
Charmed, I'm sure.

175
00:06:56,746 --> 00:06:58,545
This is Saul,
he's gonna be the DP.

176
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:00,160
Saul, how're you doing?

177
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,468
Nico, can you take his stuff?

178
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:02,549
- Just got some props.

179
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:05,174
Some some of my, some
of my swinging stuff.

180
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,086
That, you can take this,

181
00:07:06,086 --> 00:07:07,764
- thank you very much.
- Okay, let's go.

182
00:07:07,764 --> 00:07:09,349
- Service with a smile.

183
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:11,204
Come on, let's see that smile.

184
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:12,647
- I can work with him if you want me to.

185
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:13,523
- Okay, yeah, I want you to.

186
00:07:13,523 --> 00:07:15,330
- But I, I really-

187
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,262
- I want you to work with him.

188
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:19,399
- I don't believe that
this is the right thing

189
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,233
for you, miss.

190
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,161
- That's okay.

191
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:22,939
- You're a lady.

192
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:24,304
You don't, you don't be in the same room

193
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:25,860
with someone like this.
- Jason is here!

194
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,708
Gonna get my Gloria Swanson together.

195
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,710
- This is a drug addict,

196
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:31,289
whore,

197
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:33,873
faggot.

198
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:37,870
This nigger is like
like 100% a degenerate.

199
00:07:38,818 --> 00:07:40,140
You don't want him.

200
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,267
Are you
gonna do this job or not?

201
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:45,485
- I wanna work for you, but not this job.

202
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:47,147
Shirley, what time do we start?

203
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:48,268
Stay cool.
- I know you.

204
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,527
Yeah, I maybe cool-
- Yeah, I know you

205
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:50,585
and you know me,

206
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:52,369
and we are all together.

207
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:53,203
- No, no.

208
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:54,037
I'm not together with you.

209
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:56,428
- You can't make the scene
then you ain't clean.

210
00:07:56,428 --> 00:07:58,315
- Oh, well, I'm clean, you're...

211
00:07:58,315 --> 00:07:59,429
You're the one.
- Okay, Jason, I'm sorry.

212
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:00,365
I want you to get out of here.

213
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:01,199
- If you kick me out of here, I'm-

214
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,033
- Where's John?

215
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:02,980
- John, get him out.
- I'm taking my equipment.

216
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,814
- Whoo!
- You know,

217
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:04,955
I'm not gonna let you use this stuff.

218
00:08:04,955 --> 00:08:06,090
- Somebody needs a Valium.

219
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:06,923
- Get out of here!

220
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:08,358
- I have not made my point.
- What's wrong with you?

221
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:09,776
- And you fucking get out of my face!

222
00:08:09,776 --> 00:08:11,311
Nico looks a
little, a little shaken.

223
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:13,523
- Nico doesn't do-
- It's all right, honey.

224
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:15,030
- Let's go!
- So, um,

225
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,895
I don't know.

226
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:16,729
Close the door.

227
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:17,947
Thank you. Yeah, get Jason a drink.

228
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:19,730
- Vodka tonic.

229
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,795
Lesson number one:
- John, do you think

230
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:22,210
you can run the camera?
- Always remember the order.

231
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,841
- All right.

232
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:24,687
That guy sucked!

233
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:27,137
- I don't know.
- That was a drag.

234
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:29,269
Guess I'm gonna just make
myself homely.

235
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:30,103
- Yeah, okay.

236
00:08:30,103 --> 00:08:32,092
Well, we'll be ready in a minute.

237
00:08:32,092 --> 00:08:33,923
Thanks, John, okay.

238
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:34,757
- Shirley, where's Carl?

239
00:08:34,757 --> 00:08:36,292
- Yeah, where's Carl.

240
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:38,811
- You told me Carl was gonna be here.

241
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:40,894
- It's nice to have you over.

242
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:44,378
- And you turn it on over here.

243
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:46,496
- Just-
- You got a lot of stuff here,

244
00:08:46,496 --> 00:08:47,717
looks expensive.

245
00:08:47,717 --> 00:08:49,579
- Yeah, you see that horrible painting

246
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:51,311
on the wall over there?

247
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:53,053
My ex-boyfriend painted that.

248
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:54,064
Your ex boyfriend?

249
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:55,065
Yeah, I have an ex boyfriend

250
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:55,925
who's a bad artist.

251
00:08:55,925 --> 00:08:57,877
- An ex boyfriend?

252
00:08:57,877 --> 00:09:01,201
And you're calling him
a bad artist?

253
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:02,314
Rolling,

254
00:09:02,314 --> 00:09:03,583
when I do I say those things?
- Well, a fact's a fact.

255
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,417
- You don't say anything.

256
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:06,166
You just gotta keep an eye on the levels.

257
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,597
- So Carly ain't coming?

258
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:10,420
I don't know if I can
even do this without Carl.

259
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,384
Carl's my anchor.

260
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:14,046
- Let's try.

261
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:16,109
Let's try.

262
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,015
Nico, get him another drink.

263
00:09:24,404 --> 00:09:26,876
- Get one bull yourself, Nico!

264
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:28,658
Thank you, honey.

265
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:30,870
Where's your drink?

266
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,622
- You want some ice for your drink?

267
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:34,957
- I'm fine. Straight up-
- You're fine.

268
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:36,075
- Straight Up Jason,

269
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,647
they call come downtown.
- Okay.

270
00:09:37,647 --> 00:09:38,828
- Just one second.
- Okay.

271
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,662
Could you
do that fast, please?

272
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,316
And then let's go.

273
00:09:41,316 --> 00:09:43,263
- One little thing that
we gotta talk about.

274
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:44,097
Why don't you sit down?
- Okay, okay.

275
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:45,128
- Sit down with Jason.

276
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:48,077
There's a little question of money

277
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:51,241
because I was talking to some people

278
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:52,872
that I know in the business.

279
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:54,894
Well, you know, these girl groups,

280
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:58,608
how they get cut out of the
rights to their own material,

281
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:00,230
how does that work?

282
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,063
- Well,

283
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:05,378
they get royalties.

284
00:10:05,378 --> 00:10:06,212
I mean, you can get...

285
00:10:06,212 --> 00:10:07,987
- Give me some royalties.

286
00:10:07,987 --> 00:10:09,924
- Well, if you want royalties

287
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:11,391
then you have to take less upfront,

288
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:13,750
you know, that's how it works, right?

289
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,596
You just write out a
first draft of a contract

290
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:17,847
and then we'll go from there.

291
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:21,331
- So if you're gonna give me less,

292
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:24,023
is there a way to get a
little something upfront?

293
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,756
- Sure. How much do you want?

294
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:31,391
- Well, I was thinking
for today, another $50.

295
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:33,263
That would be a good price, I think.

296
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:35,305
- Okay, I'll pay you
at the end of the day.

297
00:10:35,305 --> 00:10:36,224
- That's cool.

298
00:10:36,224 --> 00:10:37,192
I trust you.
- Okay.

299
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:38,025
Okay, Jason.
- How are you doing?

300
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:39,559
You look a little nervous.

301
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,670
- I'm okay.

302
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,702
I'm ready go actually. I'm excited.

303
00:10:42,702 --> 00:10:43,823
- Okay.

304
00:10:43,823 --> 00:10:45,175
So-
- Are you ready to go?

305
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:47,967
- What if I say no?

306
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:48,816
- That's it. That's the end.

307
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:50,052
- Okay, I'm copping out.

308
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:51,574
Where's my stuff?

309
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:00,210
See what's worrying me

310
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:03,273
is everything that happens in my life

311
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:06,799
is all about other people's needs.

312
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:09,091
I get drained.

313
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,425
Now I'm approaching the
age where it's almost over.

314
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,950
We're gonna shoot this film.

315
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,898
- Yeah.
- You're going to tell us

316
00:11:18,898 --> 00:11:20,340
where you've been, who you are,

317
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,462
you're gonna how people who you are.

318
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:24,113
We're gonna show it all over the country,

319
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:25,895
we're gonna show it all over the world,

320
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:26,796
you will be known.

321
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:32,161
- We wanna do something good,

322
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:33,733
and something we're good at,

323
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:36,115
and we wanna pick up a couple
of nickels here and there.

324
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:37,247
You know, when I look at you

325
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:39,639
I don't really think
of you as being white,

326
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,150
I think of you as a friend,

327
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,657
and more than that as a professional.

328
00:11:43,657 --> 00:11:44,854
I l-

329
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:47,537
Hey, Shirley, what are you asking me?

330
00:11:47,537 --> 00:11:50,189
- Like, just think of
it like an interview.

331
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:51,931
Okay, so let's start-
- Okay, I gotta warm up.

332
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:53,192
- Yeah, let's do a warm up.

333
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:56,138
- You know I got this
nightclub act going, right?

334
00:11:57,357 --> 00:11:58,458
Cameras roll.

335
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:03,948
- Ooh Lord!

336
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:05,815
My mother always told me,

337
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:09,689
one person's trash is
another person treasure-

338
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:10,523
- Jason-
- Keep something

339
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:11,561
for seven years-

340
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,032
- Jason by Shirley Clarke,

341
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,124
take one.
- You'll find some use for it.

342
00:12:15,214 --> 00:12:17,697
Problem with unemployment
is as soon as you wake up,

343
00:12:17,697 --> 00:12:20,800
you're on the job!

344
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,352
Don't feel like you have to put on a show.

345
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:23,995
You know, just be yourself.

346
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:24,829
- Boom!

347
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,564
- Just like an interview.

348
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:30,540
- Ooh wee!

349
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,263
Why do Jewish divorces cost so much?

350
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:36,346
Because they're worth it!

351
00:12:36,346 --> 00:12:38,408
Nico, why don't you light the cigarette

352
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:39,709
before you sit on my face?

353
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:40,810
- Light his cigarette.

354
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:45,505
It's show time!

355
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,725
You're giving
the audience what they want.

356
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,784
- What they think they want.

357
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,142
Cap your hands!

358
00:13:00,142 --> 00:13:02,046
Every, come on, clap your hands!

359
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:13,523
Oh, shit!

360
00:13:13,523 --> 00:13:14,766
Cut!

361
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:18,965
- Honey, I've told you
to get yourself a drink.

362
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,010
What'd you say your name is, Nico?

363
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:21,844
Nico.

364
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:22,812
- Yeah, just it's hot in here.

365
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:24,422
You got all these lights here, it's-

366
00:13:24,422 --> 00:13:25,485
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Come on, come on,

367
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:26,336
just, just relax.

368
00:13:27,247 --> 00:13:30,579
Here, here, why don't you
light it with your dick, huh?

369
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:32,101
Fuck!

370
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:33,252
Nico, here.

371
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,426
- I want everybody to be loose now.

372
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:38,416
- Well, what would be helpful to you?

373
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,249
- Let's smoke a joint.

374
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:40,083
- All right, let's smoke a joint.

375
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:40,917
Help yourself.

376
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:43,062
You know, I got married.

377
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:44,794
You know, my my real name isn't Clarke.

378
00:13:44,794 --> 00:13:45,788
Did you know that?

379
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:46,756
Mm, what's your real name?

380
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:48,277
- Brimberg.

381
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:49,248
- That's a Jewish names.

382
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:50,198
- That's right.

383
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:52,041
And you know, I grew up on Park Avenue.

384
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:52,893
- Whoo!

385
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:54,213
Park Avenue?

386
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:55,795
- My father was an industrialist.

387
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:58,017
- So it ain't total ho-ing on your part.

388
00:13:58,017 --> 00:13:59,178
- No, not at all.

389
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:00,590
- Did you love your husband?

390
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,424
No.

391
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:04,274
- Did you like him?

392
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:05,705
- Nico, can you get a match?

393
00:14:05,705 --> 00:14:08,458
- That's why you can have
nice things in this house.

394
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:12,107
You bring a nigger in and the
whole place gets nigger-fied.

395
00:14:13,543 --> 00:14:14,377
Hey, kid.

396
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:19,270
How am I

397
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,681
gonna doing

398
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:25,134
some crazy scene

399
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:29,899
in the Chelsea Hotel with
some white lady chick

400
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,358
who's living here,

401
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:33,693
who come from Park Avenue,

402
00:14:33,693 --> 00:14:36,064
who ain't on Park Avenue,

403
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:39,529
who got her motherfucking Oscar,

404
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:43,262
but she don't see to wanna play the game.

405
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:44,179
- I don't need to.

406
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:50,800
- You lucky bitch.

407
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,612
- That's right. Well-

408
00:14:52,612 --> 00:14:53,953
- An accident of birth.

409
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:56,406
- And we're gonna make a film together.

410
00:14:56,406 --> 00:14:57,797
I can't make it without you,

411
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,649
you can't make it without me. Because-

412
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,130
- All right, I gotta, I gotta,

413
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,662
I gotta get, get off my feet here.

414
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:03,883
Yeah, have a seat, honey.

415
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:05,251
All right.

416
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:06,395
- [Shirley And we'll get you a drink

417
00:15:06,395 --> 00:15:07,617
and then we're gonna start.

418
00:15:07,617 --> 00:15:10,550
So this is your time to tell your story

419
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,211
about what it's like to be you,

420
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,193
what you've lived, what you know.

421
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:15,625
- This is living!

422
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,437
This is my life.

423
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:18,270
All right, well, here,

424
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,338
take your drink.

425
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:20,520
- Vodka, straight.

426
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,731
- Thanks, baby.

427
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:22,982
Where's your drink?

428
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:24,937
Nico, get on the sound.

429
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:28,337
Get on the sound and
then get on this.

430
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:31,426
Jason by Shirley
Clarke, take four.

431
00:15:33,963 --> 00:15:35,719
Free love?

432
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:39,148
That's the only love
I can afford!

433
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,503
- Okay, we're rolling.

434
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,452
So tell us your name.

435
00:15:48,498 --> 00:15:50,272
- You want me to do
this for the the camera?

436
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:52,632
Where's your camera?

437
00:15:52,632 --> 00:15:53,466
- Right here.

438
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,071
- My name

439
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:06,195
is Jason

440
00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:07,590
Holliday.

441
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:28,297
So Jason, what
do you do for a living?

442
00:16:31,711 --> 00:16:34,023
- I'm a stone whore,

443
00:16:34,023 --> 00:16:36,115
a prostitute,

444
00:16:36,115 --> 00:16:36,949
a hooker!

445
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:43,062
Darling, I have balled
from Maine to Minnesota,

446
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:45,545
from Minnesota to Mississippi,

447
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:48,768
and balling every step of the way

448
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:50,610
all the way back.

449
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,060
Isn't it lonely
having sex with strangers?

450
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,776
- Having sex is never lonely, honey.

451
00:16:56,776 --> 00:16:59,569
Having sex is the opposite of loneliness.

452
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:03,242
I'm tri-sexual. I'll try anything once!

453
00:17:03,242 --> 00:17:05,224
I'm a seller,

454
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,245
not a buyer.

455
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:09,161
I'm a whore and I'm not ashamed of it.

456
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,871
- Jason, tell me about your old man.

457
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:19,398
- I can't do that.

458
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,702
Why didn't you do a movie about you?

459
00:17:22,702 --> 00:17:24,847
Every movie
I make is about me.

460
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:27,647
- Sho'nuff, honey!

461
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:28,480
Roll out.

462
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,970
- Change nags. Nico, follow me.

463
00:17:36,424 --> 00:17:37,737
- $50?

464
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:39,281
You gotta give me 75!

465
00:17:41,156 --> 00:17:41,990
You're killing me!

466
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,238
- I'm going to pay you.

467
00:17:43,238 --> 00:17:44,869
I have it.

468
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,169
- I wanna know what is

469
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:53,572
about this movie

470
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,254
that's gonna help my show.

471
00:17:55,254 --> 00:17:57,670
You telling me it's a publicity angle,

472
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:02,281
but you saying that you don't care

473
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,740
whether it wins Academy Award or not.

474
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,615
- You know what, I have an idea.

475
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:07,126
Let's change the whole concept.

476
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:08,237
- Okay.

477
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:10,499
- Let's make it all be about your show.

478
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:13,122
I'll interview you about your influences,

479
00:18:13,122 --> 00:18:15,995
the people you've met, your background,

480
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,737
how you came to be a singer.

481
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:19,068
You'll describes your show,

482
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:20,670
you'll give them a little taste,

483
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:23,542
and then they'll want more.

484
00:18:29,178 --> 00:18:30,930
- You know what?
- What?

485
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:33,342
- Change of heart.

486
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:37,116
Okay, so we'll do it that way.

487
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,428
We'll talk about your work.

488
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:40,817
John, let's go!

489
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:44,095
Um, I've got
to switch audiotapes.

490
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,018
Okay.

491
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:50,269
Where's Nico?

492
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:55,274
Nico, keep rolling sound
no matter what happens,

493
00:18:55,388 --> 00:18:57,429
I wanna get everything.

494
00:19:04,984 --> 00:19:05,835
Rolling.

495
00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:10,698
Jason by Shirley
Clarke, take five.

496
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,546
- What's a Jewish pedophile pick-up line?

497
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:19,021
Wanna buy some candy?

498
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:24,323
I don't see you laughing, Shirley.

499
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:25,227
- I'm laughing.

500
00:19:27,176 --> 00:19:29,441
I'm laughing.

501
00:19:29,441 --> 00:19:30,529
Just like,

502
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:31,363
I'm laughing.

503
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:35,855
Okay.

504
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:37,589
So what was your father like?

505
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:39,892
- Hmm.

506
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,984
Hold on, you told me that
this film is about me!

507
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:45,818
- No.

508
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:46,651
- Is this camera rolling?

509
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:47,485
- All the cameras are rolling.
- Yeah,

510
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:48,319
All the cameras are rolling.
- All right.

511
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,059
'Cause it sounds to me
like you want to come

512
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:52,801
with some motherfucking chitlin bit!

513
00:19:53,913 --> 00:19:56,145
I'm just so itchy.

514
00:19:56,145 --> 00:19:58,560
You know what it's like
to have that Carl Jones.

515
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,541
I think you and me have been there, right?

516
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,290
- When Carl comes he can save the day.

517
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,545
Take six.

518
00:20:06,545 --> 00:20:09,171
- Tell me about your dream show.

519
00:20:15,444 --> 00:20:16,378
- I see blue.

520
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:20,830
New York's finest nightclubs.

521
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,082
Only the best people.

522
00:20:23,082 --> 00:20:24,083
Blue lights.

523
00:20:25,717 --> 00:20:27,296
Blue smoke.

524
00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:30,522
Hot musicians, dancing girls,

525
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,412
and I'll sing and tell jokes,

526
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:34,777
and be a fabulous star!

527
00:20:37,456 --> 00:20:39,311
I'll sing blues and jazz,

528
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:42,855
and all the classics

529
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:48,331
Tiny little blue angles,
what do they call them?

530
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,165
Putti?

531
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,446
Hanging from the sky.

532
00:20:51,446 --> 00:20:52,697
I'll be a star!

533
00:20:56,511 --> 00:20:57,763
I'll be a star!

534
00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:01,974
- So Jason, what's the
date for this cabaret act?

535
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:06,568
What's the date?
- Booking comes late.

536
00:21:08,365 --> 00:21:09,789
I mean, when
are you gonna really do it?

537
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:13,342
- Well, that's the thing,
Shirley, I have the talent,

538
00:21:13,342 --> 00:21:15,084
but the money, Shirley,

539
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:15,918
it's all about the money.

540
00:21:15,918 --> 00:21:18,868
- I've seen you burn through
huge amounts of money.

541
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:20,990
- I ain't saying that I
didn't blow a lot of cash.

542
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,092
- Anyone who says that
they need money to make art

543
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:24,273
isn't telling the truth.

544
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:26,388
Art is about the relationship,

545
00:21:28,427 --> 00:21:30,219
it's about having a
relationship with other people

546
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:32,501
where you tell the truth to each other,

547
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:34,552
and you change each other,

548
00:21:34,552 --> 00:21:35,494
and then you produce something

549
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,616
that will change other people,

550
00:21:37,616 --> 00:21:39,318
that's what it's about.

551
00:21:39,318 --> 00:21:42,494
Money is just an excuse for you, Jason.

552
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,004
That must feel very strange,

553
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:47,506
like everyone's running
and you're standing still.

554
00:21:49,728 --> 00:21:50,970
- What?

555
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,174
- I mean, look at Carl.

556
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:54,486
Carl just played Hamlet.

557
00:21:55,499 --> 00:21:59,318
Darling, it
must have been wonderful.

558
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,440
Did he get all the words right?

559
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,013
- He doesn't let anything stop him.

560
00:22:04,013 --> 00:22:06,648
And you, you let everything stop you.

561
00:22:08,097 --> 00:22:09,578
Why?

562
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,582
What's it like to be lying all the time?

563
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,094
What's it like to be telling people

564
00:22:15,094 --> 00:22:17,054
that you're gonna do this
and you're gonna do that,

565
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:18,904
and you're not gonna do any of it?

566
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:23,792
You hit the nail on the head.

567
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:26,185
The reason black people are in pain

568
00:22:26,185 --> 00:22:29,368
is because they won't take
aspirin from the bottle,

569
00:22:29,368 --> 00:22:31,420
it involves cotton picking.

570
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,842
- All right, cut!

571
00:22:33,842 --> 00:22:36,537
- Jason by Shirley Clarke, take seven.

572
00:22:36,537 --> 00:22:37,957
- Hey, baby.

573
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,549
You're a lot like these
white ladies I work for.

574
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:41,560
What are they like?

575
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,493
- They take control the whole galaxy

576
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,177
when the old man ain't around,

577
00:22:48,177 --> 00:22:50,719
except for the ones that are
able to put the old man away

578
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:51,853
one way or the other.

579
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:57,416
But yeah, it's a lot of control.

580
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:58,901
What do you do for them?

581
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,811
- Pretty much whatever they want.

582
00:23:02,811 --> 00:23:04,994
But a lot of times I
have to guess what it is

583
00:23:04,994 --> 00:23:07,809
because most times they don't
know what it is they want.

584
00:23:09,118 --> 00:23:12,291
So I fry a little chicken,
I scramble a few eggs,

585
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:15,194
but most of all I just make
them feel like they're wanted.

586
00:23:17,138 --> 00:23:19,656
I give them, if not love,

587
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,854
something is close to as they never have.

588
00:23:25,074 --> 00:23:26,949
And, yeah, I walk their dogs,

589
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:29,561
pet their cats,

590
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,192
water the plants,

591
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:34,026
whatever,

592
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,448
cook their greens,

593
00:23:38,237 --> 00:23:39,301
do their shopping,

594
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:41,420
the whole nine yards.

595
00:23:44,197 --> 00:23:46,158
Do you like working for them?

596
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:49,321
- Do I like working?

597
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,703
When it's work, you can
guarantee I don't like it.

598
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,820
So this is the trick of all tricks:

599
00:24:00,536 --> 00:24:03,859
You make what you do what you like,

600
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,863
and then you make what
you like what you do,

601
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,786
and when they come
together it's all groovy.

602
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:13,702
And when it ain't groovy,

603
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:18,400
that's the time that you start
moving on to something else.

604
00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:22,488
- And that's what I do.
- Jason-

605
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,194
- There's these rich white ladies-

606
00:24:25,194 --> 00:24:26,505
- Jason-
- That I'm just like

607
00:24:26,505 --> 00:24:29,048
waiting hand and foot on-
Jason.

608
00:24:29,048 --> 00:24:31,020
Giving them
whatever it is they want-

609
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,511
- Oh, Jason-

610
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:35,148
- Vacuum their floor, which
is better than sweeping.

611
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:36,582
Jason.

612
00:24:36,582 --> 00:24:38,687
And they just say in my head.

613
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,329
Jason!

614
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:41,823
Just think about how this feels.

615
00:24:41,823 --> 00:24:43,387
- Oh, it feels so wonderful.

616
00:24:43,387 --> 00:24:45,658
Just think about the feeling.

617
00:24:45,658 --> 00:24:48,617
- You know, I never
much cared for niggers.

618
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:50,549
Jason, now, you've gone too far!

619
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:52,531
Once is quite enough.

620
00:24:52,531 --> 00:24:54,653
So you think one nigger feel

621
00:24:54,653 --> 00:24:56,468
is the same as another nigger feel?

622
00:24:57,836 --> 00:25:01,230
- I don't know anything
about how a nigger feels.

623
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:04,496
Your services are not needed!

624
00:25:05,794 --> 00:25:06,855
- So you say.

625
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:08,957
But you didn't say that last week

626
00:25:08,957 --> 00:25:11,468
when I had these fingers up in your pussy.

627
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:18,610
- Jason, don't you know
how I feel about you?

628
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,204
- When I look at you, I see a phony,

629
00:25:23,112 --> 00:25:24,683
aging,

630
00:25:24,683 --> 00:25:27,526
white spoiled bitch

631
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,270
that has nothing to rely on but her money,

632
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,236
her so-called breeding and her reputation.

633
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,760
Well, you know, I didn't
mean it all that way.

634
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,821
What makes you feel good?

635
00:25:43,952 --> 00:25:46,405
- Well, that you have a wonderful smile

636
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:48,290
and a terrific laugh.

637
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,374
Oh!

638
00:25:50,836 --> 00:25:53,702
- Oh, Jason, I'm not here
to play games with you!

639
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:56,065
- Bend your knees like this.

640
00:25:56,065 --> 00:25:58,477
- Throw your leg up!
- Whoo!

641
00:26:01,338 --> 00:26:02,313
There you go!

642
00:26:02,313 --> 00:26:04,963
- There you go!
- Whoo!

643
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:08,287
Oh, oh, honey, it's all right.

644
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:09,361
It will be fine.

645
00:26:25,028 --> 00:26:26,066
Like this?

646
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:27,852
You like it?

647
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,761
And how many
times did you have to do that,

648
00:26:42,761 --> 00:26:43,595
Jason?

649
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:53,985
I'm doing it now with you.

650
00:26:58,747 --> 00:26:59,581
Cut!

651
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:04,002
- I'm getting a little
lost in my realities here.

652
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:06,525
Nico, can you
take everyone's lunch order?

653
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:08,307
Call the deli.

654
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:09,141
- Which one?

655
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:10,008
- Ben's Deli down the street.

656
00:27:10,008 --> 00:27:11,250
Corned beef, pastrami,
whatever people want.

657
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,321
Just get a piece of paper and
ask everyone what they want.

658
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:14,155
- Sandwiches and stuff?

659
00:27:14,155 --> 00:27:15,664
- Yeah, thanks.

660
00:27:15,664 --> 00:27:17,599
- This is pure joy.

661
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:21,963
'Cause in this scene, Nico's the nigger.

662
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:24,546
So where that deli, boy?

663
00:27:26,054 --> 00:27:27,769
Deli boy, I'm getting fed up.

664
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:56,498
Mrs. Clarke, is everything okay?

665
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,288
- Nico, you're gonna to
be a director some day

666
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:00,699
so learn from me.

667
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:05,704
Jason is doing everything
that we want him to do,

668
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:09,368
but don't let him know.

669
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:10,969
Got it?

670
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:13,011
And you're doing good too.

671
00:28:13,011 --> 00:28:13,972
- Okay.

672
00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:15,173
- Shirley, where's Carl?

673
00:28:16,605 --> 00:28:18,094
- Where is Carl?

674
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:21,546
He works, you know?

675
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:23,892
He works it.

676
00:28:23,892 --> 00:28:25,294
And you know that as well I,

677
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,317
'cause Carl's gonna do something for you,

678
00:28:28,317 --> 00:28:30,194
Carl does something for me.

679
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:32,405
- Have you ever seen Carl show up on time?

680
00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:33,392
I have not.

681
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:34,226
Okay.
- Honey,

682
00:28:34,226 --> 00:28:37,299
Carl is supposed to be a
motherfucking professional!

683
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:39,604
He is

684
00:28:39,604 --> 00:28:42,857
I thought,

685
00:28:42,857 --> 00:28:46,248
I thought y'all were gonna teach me.

686
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:50,889
As far as fucks as I can see,

687
00:28:50,889 --> 00:28:54,132
you would be a mess as I am.

688
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,828
- When he was a star,
he was there on time.

689
00:28:58,547 --> 00:29:00,809
- You saying Carl ain't no star?

690
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:02,491
- No, when he did "Cool World."

691
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,685
- You said when he was.

692
00:29:03,685 --> 00:29:06,097
When he was
the star of the film.

693
00:29:06,097 --> 00:29:07,684
You wanna just hand out
everyone's sandwiches?

694
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:12,311
Okay, everybody, half hour.

695
00:29:12,311 --> 00:29:14,002
- Carl's my engine.
- Jason, Jason,

696
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,404
let's go for a walk.
- Carl's my engine.

697
00:29:15,404 --> 00:29:16,254
Croatian John?

698
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,037
- What? I'm now supposed to go
for walk like a fucking dog?

699
00:29:19,037 --> 00:29:21,169
Let's go up on
the roof, it's beautiful.

700
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:22,431
You've been on the roof of the Chelsea.

701
00:29:22,431 --> 00:29:24,082
Come on, get your coat, let's go.

702
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:26,365
We're climbing Jacob's ladder.

703
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:27,198
Whoa!

704
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,837
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

705
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:37,886
Nice, right?

706
00:29:37,886 --> 00:29:38,827
You come up here all the time?

707
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:41,639
- Every day, every morning.

708
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:44,766
- Hmm, so this is how the other half live?

709
00:29:45,804 --> 00:29:47,566
- It's not the half.

710
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:49,668
Jason, how do you think the movie's going?

711
00:29:56,805 --> 00:29:59,077
- Like it means something to me?

712
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:01,037
Like I'm going to know?

713
00:30:01,037 --> 00:30:02,731
How is the movie's going?
- Well-

714
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:03,732
- You tell me,
how is the movie going?

715
00:30:03,732 --> 00:30:05,614
- All right, let me tell you.

716
00:30:05,614 --> 00:30:08,273
I've shot five hours of you.

717
00:30:10,051 --> 00:30:11,983
I have enough to make a feature film.

718
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:14,986
Is that how you wanna be seen?

719
00:30:14,986 --> 00:30:17,135
I think you should listen
to what I'm saying.

720
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:18,644
- Honey, I'm listening.
- I have five hours of you.

721
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:19,478
- I'm listening.

722
00:30:19,478 --> 00:30:21,507
I'm carrying this lunch
bag and I'm listening.

723
00:30:21,507 --> 00:30:22,378
Okay.

724
00:30:22,378 --> 00:30:23,878
- And I told you I'm hungry.

725
00:30:23,878 --> 00:30:26,314
Is what you
want the world to see of you

726
00:30:26,314 --> 00:30:27,849
already in that camera?

727
00:30:30,048 --> 00:30:31,643
- Oh, it's a pride issue.

728
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:35,121
- No, it's about truth.

729
00:30:35,121 --> 00:30:36,565
You want me to tell
you something about truth?

730
00:30:36,565 --> 00:30:38,497
You want the story from Jason's side?

731
00:30:38,497 --> 00:30:39,628
- No, don't want a story.

732
00:30:39,628 --> 00:30:40,969
You wanna hear the
story from Jason's voice?

733
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:42,768
- No! I don't wanna hear a story.

734
00:30:42,768 --> 00:30:44,205
I want you to listen to me.

735
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:47,185
Is that how you wanna
be shown to the world?

736
00:30:47,185 --> 00:30:49,838
What you've given so far,
is that who you want to be?

737
00:30:51,964 --> 00:30:53,515
- What am I trying to say?

738
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:54,796
What am I trying to say?
- You need to think about

739
00:30:54,796 --> 00:30:56,635
what you want the world to see

740
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:57,549
and you need to give that to me,

741
00:30:57,549 --> 00:30:59,708
because otherwise what you've done so far

742
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:01,400
is what's gonna stand in for you.

743
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,671
- Okay, okay.
- You know what?

744
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:03,505
You're not listening.

745
00:31:03,505 --> 00:31:05,033
It's not about me.

746
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:07,486
I've got the footage. It's about you.

747
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:08,874
- My world.

748
00:31:10,819 --> 00:31:12,831
is the jazz world.

749
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:14,453
Night after night,

750
00:31:14,453 --> 00:31:18,617
swinging and listening to the be-bop.

751
00:31:18,617 --> 00:31:20,038
To the

752
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:22,516
To the

753
00:31:22,516 --> 00:31:25,316
I'm talking you smoking,
I'm talking drinking,

754
00:31:26,214 --> 00:31:27,736
I'm talking hanging out.

755
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:28,996
I mean, look at this world.

756
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:30,080
Come with me.

757
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,402
Come on.

758
00:31:33,402 --> 00:31:35,454
They say it's a whole new world.

759
00:31:35,454 --> 00:31:38,937
And me digging on this beautiful scene-

760
00:31:38,937 --> 00:31:39,918
- Okay, well, you think it over.

761
00:31:39,918 --> 00:31:41,830
- It's just like I just wanna be here.

762
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:46,475
I just wanna be here in your
world just for a minute.

763
00:31:46,475 --> 00:31:48,176
Why can't you see the beauty here?

764
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:51,800
I mean-

765
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,062
- Okay, so this is what I
wanna talk to you about:

766
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:55,884
how you became an artist.

767
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:57,276
Take 15.

768
00:32:04,936 --> 00:32:06,935
- I wanna do that again, keep rolling.

769
00:32:06,935 --> 00:32:08,206
Take 17.

770
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:09,427
- It's working for me.

771
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,699
Take 18.

772
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:15,124
- You are trying to open
me up like a Maryland crab.

773
00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:19,678
You ever eat Maryland crabs?

774
00:32:19,678 --> 00:32:20,899
No.

775
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:22,240
- It's a messy business.

776
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,961
Take 19.

777
00:32:26,142 --> 00:32:26,992
Okay.

778
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:33,351
Hmm.

779
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,320
- Jason, I wanna move
you around a little bit.

780
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,384
Okay.

781
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:38,374
- Can you stand up, you know?

782
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,766
Do you need something?

783
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,228
- Jason by Shirley Clarke, take 20.

784
00:32:50,228 --> 00:32:51,920
- Colored people have nothing.

785
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,772
And when I say people, I
mean power to the people!

786
00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:58,396
Whoo, Jason, you are a fool's fool.

787
00:32:58,396 --> 00:33:00,519
- It's okay, just keep rolling.

788
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,107
- Take 21.

789
00:33:05,213 --> 00:33:08,316
- Jason by Shirley Clark, take 22.

790
00:33:08,316 --> 00:33:09,908
- Can you tell that cop story?

791
00:33:09,908 --> 00:33:11,503
So how did you feel
when they locked you up?

792
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:14,693
- What the fuck do you mean how do I feel?

793
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:19,698
How would you feel being
locked up like an animal

794
00:33:19,942 --> 00:33:24,776
for not much reason except for
being what and who you are?

795
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,689
- No, I can't.

796
00:33:28,527 --> 00:33:30,819
- Let me tell you, it's like this:

797
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:32,821
Have you ever had somebody you love

798
00:33:33,662 --> 00:33:37,355
- turn their back on?
- Yes.

799
00:33:37,355 --> 00:33:39,367
- Have you ever had
somebody who don't love

800
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:41,783
- turn the back on you?
- Yes.

801
00:33:44,312 --> 00:33:45,513
- So how does that feel?

802
00:33:47,746 --> 00:33:50,569
- I know that when you were
locked up you got very upset,

803
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:51,610
tell us about that...

804
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,287
What happened with your glasses?

805
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,571
Let's do that again.

806
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:05,099
Take 23.

807
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:06,150
So Jason,

808
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:10,261
tell me about your old man.

809
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,405
- Mm.

810
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:21,192
So I was brought up by
my momma and my sisters.

811
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:26,464
I was the baby princess,

812
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,387
they would put pajama top on my head

813
00:34:29,387 --> 00:34:32,010
and the pajama tops,
they'd make a little braid,

814
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,926
and they would worship me
that the little princess.

815
00:34:36,735 --> 00:34:38,600
My old man, they called Tough.

816
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,741
And they did not call
Tough tough for no reason.

817
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:46,067
Tough had muscles out to here.

818
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:49,027
Well, how
did he feel about you?

819
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:50,128
- I think he loved me.

820
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,543
He loves babies.

821
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:55,994
Except you gotta understand
with colored people,

822
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:59,577
a man's world is a woman's world

823
00:34:59,577 --> 00:35:02,530
pretending that it's a man's world.

824
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,422
Once you get to a certain age,

825
00:35:04,422 --> 00:35:06,417
say the time that you can talk,

826
00:35:07,766 --> 00:35:08,599
Tough's over you.

827
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:10,048
Tough was beautiful man.

828
00:35:10,048 --> 00:35:13,662
I remember it even from
the time I was young,

829
00:35:13,662 --> 00:35:16,524
and Tough is standing there
and he's like shaving,

830
00:35:16,524 --> 00:35:18,336
and I'm down here at the floor,

831
00:35:18,336 --> 00:35:20,799
just to Tough's knees practically,

832
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:22,270
and what do I see?

833
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,447
This gorgeous long
thing just hanging down.

834
00:35:27,822 --> 00:35:30,737
And of course, I'm only coming up to here,

835
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:33,321
and Tough's like standing
up, towering over me,

836
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:35,083
not paying no attention to me at all.

837
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:36,765
To me, everything is a toy.

838
00:35:36,765 --> 00:35:39,004
And I turn around and I look and I see,

839
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,269
"Ooh, that's a pretty toy,"

840
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:42,794
and reached out for it.

841
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:44,733
And bam! Bam!

842
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:49,150
So that's Tough.

843
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:54,402
Man can't have a little
faggot boy running around

844
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,297
so he's got to do something about it.

845
00:35:57,185 --> 00:36:00,782
Takes me by the scruff of
the neck like I'm a cat.

846
00:36:02,543 --> 00:36:04,242
And that was that.

847
00:36:04,242 --> 00:36:05,626
How did you feel?

848
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:08,717
- I didn't care.

849
00:36:08,717 --> 00:36:11,362
I was just a baby, it
didn't mean nothing to me.

850
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,182
Okay, cut.

851
00:36:20,668 --> 00:36:22,991
- What did the Trenton county sheriff

852
00:36:22,991 --> 00:36:25,804
call the nigger that got shot 14 times?

853
00:36:25,804 --> 00:36:29,193
The worst case of suicide he ever did see.

854
00:36:45,273 --> 00:36:46,725
- Okay, cut.

855
00:36:46,725 --> 00:36:48,106
I think we have 20 good minutes.

856
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:50,618
- Mm.
- Okay, so we need 90.

857
00:36:50,618 --> 00:36:51,452
- Mm.

858
00:36:51,452 --> 00:36:53,171
- Okay, so don't waste any more time.

859
00:36:53,171 --> 00:36:54,472
- Okay.
- Just go for it.

860
00:36:54,472 --> 00:36:56,384
- Okay.
- And the faster

861
00:36:56,384 --> 00:36:58,867
you go forward and the truer it is,

862
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:00,018
the sooner we'll be out of here.

863
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:00,896
- Okay.
- Okay?

864
00:37:00,896 --> 00:37:01,960
- All right.
- Great.

865
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,542
- Take 27.
- Hey!

866
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:06,684
So who's your first white boy?

867
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:08,987
- I count two as my first.

868
00:37:08,987 --> 00:37:12,170
There's the first that's physical,

869
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,523
and then there's the first
that's coming from the heart.

870
00:37:15,523 --> 00:37:17,959
Where is he, your white boy?

871
00:37:20,008 --> 00:37:22,110
- Running around doing his thing, I guess.

872
00:37:23,256 --> 00:37:24,090
Yeah.

873
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:27,879
Chickens come home to roost.

874
00:37:30,188 --> 00:37:31,022
I miss him,

875
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,824
I really do.

876
00:37:35,293 --> 00:37:38,056
So what do
you like about white men?

877
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:39,757
- What I like most about white men

878
00:37:42,934 --> 00:37:46,464
is when you get into them,
you really get into them.

879
00:37:49,454 --> 00:37:52,400
And I'm talking about the rectum

880
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,155
that's like a sweet, soft
peach.

881
00:37:57,155 --> 00:37:59,361
Take 24.

882
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:00,195
- I want some sparkle plenty's.

883
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,360
Have you got any sparkle plenty's?

884
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,373
You know, you get the chemistry going.

885
00:38:05,373 --> 00:38:07,525
- John, you have any sparkle plenty's?

886
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:08,426
- John?

887
00:38:08,426 --> 00:38:09,260
I do not.

888
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,939
- You know I know this cat.

889
00:38:10,939 --> 00:38:12,440
How do you know John?

890
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,095
- Well, it's not my job to
tell what shouldn't be told.

891
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,796
First time I met this cat,

892
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:23,801
this cat wanted to know if I
was a transsexual.

893
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:27,185
Why? What were you wearing?

894
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:28,271
- I'll show you.

895
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,854
- Do you know him?

896
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:33,833
No, do not.

897
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,165
- Okay.

898
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:37,334
- I miss him. I really do.

899
00:38:39,707 --> 00:38:41,459
It's like a sweet soft peach.

900
00:38:46,379 --> 00:38:47,662
Oh, fuck!

901
00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:54,606
Oh, where have you been
Billy-Boy, Billy-Boy.

902
00:38:55,871 --> 00:38:57,032
- Hi, Jason.

903
00:38:57,032 --> 00:38:59,477
- Hey, come and sit over here.

904
00:38:59,477 --> 00:39:00,484
Sit down with me.

905
00:39:04,237 --> 00:39:05,777
- I can hear your pipes leaking.

906
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:12,640
- Honey, you look so good.

907
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:22,943
It's called the Frug, you ever seen it?

908
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,189
The Twist will never go out of style.

909
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,993
There's a little hardness in you, boy.

910
00:39:41,993 --> 00:39:44,575
I'm not the
same boy before, Jason.

911
00:39:45,523 --> 00:39:47,966
- I'm not the same Jason you met, boy.

912
00:39:47,966 --> 00:39:49,387
- Yes, you are.

913
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,069
You're still working on the same songs,

914
00:39:51,069 --> 00:39:53,001
still doing the same shows.

915
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:54,302
- And so what are you now?

916
00:39:54,302 --> 00:39:55,720
- I'm free.

917
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,654
- Free?
- Free.

918
00:39:56,654 --> 00:39:58,356
- Tell me freedom.

919
00:39:58,356 --> 00:40:00,909
- Have you ever seen a
sunset on top of a mountain?

920
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,861
I've been to Brazil.

921
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:05,353
I've been to Africa.

922
00:40:05,353 --> 00:40:06,387
I've been to London.

923
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:08,616
I've been to Taiwan.

924
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:11,019
- How are you gonna be
doing all that traveling?

925
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:13,942
Is your mommy still paying your way?

926
00:40:13,942 --> 00:40:15,073
- No.

927
00:40:15,073 --> 00:40:16,988
- Lucky white boy. No?

928
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:20,398
Oh,

929
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:21,679
I see.

930
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:24,812
So you have learned a
trick or two from Jason.

931
00:40:24,812 --> 00:40:25,974
- I borrow.

932
00:40:25,974 --> 00:40:27,112
- Mm-hmm.

933
00:40:27,112 --> 00:40:28,819
And you pay back, I'm sure.

934
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:34,120
So now little Billy-Boy is all grown up.

935
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,954
- All grown up.

936
00:40:34,954 --> 00:40:39,347
- And he's gonna show Jason what it's like

937
00:40:39,347 --> 00:40:43,094
to live the of a grown white man, huh?

938
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:47,904
- Or should I live the
life of a grown black man?

939
00:40:51,479 --> 00:40:52,800
What should I do?

940
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,871
Just be real.

941
00:40:56,944 --> 00:40:58,149
stay in your groove,

942
00:40:59,477 --> 00:41:00,678
dig what you're digging.

943
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,955
And give Uncle Jason a kiss.

944
00:41:15,297 --> 00:41:16,468
You want more?

945
00:41:16,468 --> 00:41:17,969
There's more left.

946
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,391
Let me get an ashtray before
we burn this place down.

947
00:41:32,487 --> 00:41:35,084
You don't know me, Jason.

948
00:41:35,084 --> 00:41:39,410
- I want you because you were
the only who ever wanted me

949
00:41:42,451 --> 00:41:45,023
for what and who I am

950
00:41:45,023 --> 00:41:47,965
without feeling that it was something

951
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:51,932
you had to make excuses
for, explain about,

952
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,885
or otherwise completely deny.

953
00:41:57,275 --> 00:41:59,780
- Wow, that's really beautiful.

954
00:42:09,687 --> 00:42:11,289
- Yeah, honey, you have changed.

955
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,973
You look tired.

956
00:42:13,872 --> 00:42:14,815
- Why don't you come to bed?
- I don't,

957
00:42:14,815 --> 00:42:16,845
I don't feel tired.

958
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:44,899
- Come one!

959
00:42:44,899 --> 00:42:45,733
- Jason!

960
00:42:45,733 --> 00:42:46,963
- You got me into this.
- Jason!

961
00:42:46,963 --> 00:42:47,797
- Why are you backing off?

962
00:42:47,797 --> 00:42:48,789
- Get off me, Jason!

963
00:42:49,678 --> 00:42:51,513
Jason! Get off, Jason!

964
00:42:53,143 --> 00:42:53,976
Just relax.

965
00:42:56,364 --> 00:42:57,998
- Stop, Jason, please!

966
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:00,010
White boy!

967
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,399
Is that all you fucking see?

968
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:02,252
Fuck you! Get off me!

969
00:43:02,252 --> 00:43:03,331
- This is not even my place.

970
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,255
- Shut up!

971
00:43:05,243 --> 00:43:07,007
- I was gonna ask you to stay here.

972
00:43:10,238 --> 00:43:11,149
I want you to be happy.

973
00:43:11,149 --> 00:43:13,800
I don't want, I don't want
you to fight, you know?

974
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:22,840
- Come on.

975
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,910
- I'm not gonna sing it with you.

976
00:43:39,727 --> 00:43:40,957
Jason.

977
00:43:50,057 --> 00:43:51,088
I'm just gonna have Alka-Seltzer

978
00:43:51,088 --> 00:43:52,313
if he wants some Alka-Seltzer.

979
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,915
I don't think
he wants any Alka-Seltzer.

980
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:56,834
- Hello, darling.

981
00:43:58,766 --> 00:43:59,600
I wanna ask you something

982
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,609
but I want you to promise
me that you'll answer it

983
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:03,551
before I ask.

984
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:07,365
- My advice to you is to
ask and see what happens.

985
00:44:10,688 --> 00:44:12,240
- Alright. I'll do it your way.

986
00:44:13,691 --> 00:44:15,456
- Here's my last question for now.

987
00:44:17,915 --> 00:44:19,617
Tell us about when you were raped.

988
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,909
- Mm, that might require

989
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:27,198
a little cleansing ritual.

990
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:41,989
This is when colored folks
bring in the Indian in them

991
00:44:41,989 --> 00:44:44,770
'cause you know all colored
folks got Indian blood, right?

992
00:44:46,572 --> 00:44:49,935
Or so we say.

993
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:12,102
Feeling clean?

994
00:45:12,102 --> 00:45:13,951
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

995
00:45:13,951 --> 00:45:15,993
- Tell us about when you were raped.

996
00:45:15,993 --> 00:45:16,994
Do you call it rape?

997
00:45:18,236 --> 00:45:19,179
- Let me ask you,

998
00:45:20,664 --> 00:45:22,833
what was it like on your wedding night?

999
00:45:23,961 --> 00:45:25,246
Did you call that rape?

1000
00:45:26,564 --> 00:45:27,858
- I call that boring.

1001
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,284
What do you want, Jason?

1002
00:45:36,053 --> 00:45:36,904
- I want Carl.

1003
00:45:41,208 --> 00:45:42,833
What else do you want?

1004
00:45:45,773 --> 00:45:48,178
- I want to be free.

1005
00:45:50,468 --> 00:45:54,084
Tell me what I need to do to be free.

1006
00:45:55,112 --> 00:45:56,664
Is this gonna be another Oscar?

1007
00:45:58,135 --> 00:45:59,487
You never know,

1008
00:46:00,398 --> 00:46:01,462
but I don't think so.

1009
00:46:03,691 --> 00:46:05,553
- So what about the Candy Man?

1010
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:07,084
What about him?

1011
00:46:07,084 --> 00:46:07,918
- Is he coming?

1012
00:46:09,317 --> 00:46:12,651
- That's why you wanna see Carl?

1013
00:46:13,485 --> 00:46:14,675
You want dope.

1014
00:46:15,513 --> 00:46:16,347
That's so banal.

1015
00:46:18,015 --> 00:46:20,638
Why didn't you just
tell me three hours ago?

1016
00:46:20,638 --> 00:46:22,400
I'm just gonna make a phone call.

1017
00:46:27,124 --> 00:46:29,547
Jason, you're living in the past.

1018
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:32,229
Everybody can get dope
not just black guys.

1019
00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:33,446
He lives just down the hall.

1020
00:46:34,612 --> 00:46:36,784
- Hey sweetheart, it's Shirley.
- It's crazy.

1021
00:46:36,784 --> 00:46:38,065
Hey, Miss
Lady, you need something?

1022
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:40,348
- Yeah, come on over, you know.

1023
00:46:40,348 --> 00:46:41,983
Yeah, I can make
the scene, baby, all right.

1024
00:46:41,983 --> 00:46:42,921
- Yeah.
- All right.

1025
00:46:42,921 --> 00:46:44,139
- Yeah, just come over.

1026
00:46:47,759 --> 00:46:49,216
You don't need Carl for that.

1027
00:46:49,216 --> 00:46:51,829
- Now that I know the Candy Man is coming,

1028
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:53,671
my energy has re-spiked.

1029
00:46:53,671 --> 00:46:56,894
You've been wasting
all my time over this crap?

1030
00:46:56,894 --> 00:46:59,454
- You gotta have fuel to make the fool-

1031
00:46:59,454 --> 00:47:00,408
- You're living in the past, baby.

1032
00:47:00,408 --> 00:47:02,385
- Act.
- You're living in the past.

1033
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:06,323
He'll be right here.

1034
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,625
- Excellent.

1035
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,877
- Go ahead, Nico, have a drink.

1036
00:47:09,877 --> 00:47:11,198
- Okay.
- It's about time.

1037
00:47:11,198 --> 00:47:14,061
- You know, it's almost Hanukkah?

1038
00:47:14,061 --> 00:47:16,223
- I would hardly know
when Christmas is coming

1039
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,375
except for the sales.

1040
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:19,208
Well you and I

1041
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:20,042
have that in common.
- And I don't even

1042
00:47:20,042 --> 00:47:21,034
buy anything.

1043
00:47:21,034 --> 00:47:21,868
All right then,

1044
00:47:21,868 --> 00:47:23,603
you probably shoplifted, right?

1045
00:47:23,603 --> 00:47:25,153
There you go.

1046
00:47:25,153 --> 00:47:27,615
- More than one time.
- Okay.

1047
00:47:27,615 --> 00:47:29,140
All right, just relax.

1048
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,280
- You want anything?

1049
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,114
- Hmm?

1050
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,654
- You want anything?
- Mm-mm.

1051
00:47:36,463 --> 00:47:38,416
I did underestimate you.

1052
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:39,417
You did?

1053
00:47:40,898 --> 00:47:42,139
What a surprise!

1054
00:47:42,139 --> 00:47:43,100
Do you think that happens to me

1055
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,822
every single day fucking day of my life?

1056
00:47:44,822 --> 00:47:45,753
Yes.

1057
00:47:45,753 --> 00:47:48,355
- I know it happens to you
every day of your life,

1058
00:47:48,355 --> 00:47:51,549
but what I wanna know
is what happens to you

1059
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,001
when the table turns,

1060
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:56,727
when you become the
subject of interrogation.

1061
00:47:58,185 --> 00:47:59,286
- I'm a, I'm the director,

1062
00:47:59,286 --> 00:48:01,138
so that's not gonna happen.

1063
00:48:01,138 --> 00:48:03,200
There's enough movies about women,

1064
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,105
there's not enough movies by women.

1065
00:48:06,804 --> 00:48:10,137
- My experience is very quickly becoming

1066
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,082
everybody's experience.

1067
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,176
They just don't call it the same thing.

1068
00:48:17,685 --> 00:48:19,560
It's the nigger story.

1069
00:48:20,858 --> 00:48:24,201
You think I'm joking when
I say everybody' a nigger.

1070
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,604
Do you think everybody's a Jew?

1071
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:27,438
- No, I don't.

1072
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:28,338
I don't think that.

1073
00:48:30,478 --> 00:48:31,311
I don't.

1074
00:48:33,621 --> 00:48:34,455
- So,

1075
00:48:36,363 --> 00:48:38,509
not everybody's a nigger,

1076
00:48:39,747 --> 00:48:41,482
and not everybody's a Jew,

1077
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,863
but everybody could be a Jew.

1078
00:48:45,863 --> 00:48:47,428
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Miss Lady.

1079
00:48:47,428 --> 00:48:49,058
- How are you? Hi!

1080
00:48:49,058 --> 00:48:50,350
- Hmm, mwah!

1081
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:51,184
- Come on in.
- Mwah!

1082
00:48:51,184 --> 00:48:52,490
- You know, Jason?

1083
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:54,075
- Hey.
- What's happening, baby?

1084
00:48:54,075 --> 00:48:54,909
How you doing?

1085
00:48:54,909 --> 00:48:55,833
- What you look good?
- What's up?

1086
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,204
- All right, all right, good.

1087
00:48:57,204 --> 00:48:58,666
Good, good.

1088
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:00,107
Y'all making a TV show?

1089
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:00,958
- Yeah.
- We're waiting for you.

1090
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:02,025
- Shit!

1091
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:03,615
- We're making a movie about Jason.

1092
00:49:03,615 --> 00:49:04,668
- A movie?

1093
00:49:04,668 --> 00:49:05,502
- You know I made movies.

1094
00:49:05,502 --> 00:49:07,386
- You're Harry Belafonte.

1095
00:49:07,386 --> 00:49:09,236
Shit!

1096
00:49:09,236 --> 00:49:12,079
That's lovely. That's absolutely lovely.

1097
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,743
You know, I just got into Los Angeles. Ow.

1098
00:49:15,743 --> 00:49:16,577
What were you doing?

1099
00:49:16,577 --> 00:49:19,817
- Brother named Oscar
levant had a TV show.

1100
00:49:19,817 --> 00:49:23,601
This is just after Marilyn
Monroe turned Jewish, right?

1101
00:49:23,601 --> 00:49:24,992
Yeah.

1102
00:49:24,992 --> 00:49:27,244
- Everybody turning Jewish.

1103
00:49:28,155 --> 00:49:29,276
Shit!

1104
00:49:29,276 --> 00:49:32,540
Marilyn Monroe is kosher,

1105
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,950
that mean Arthur Miller can eat her.

1106
00:49:37,615 --> 00:49:38,854
Without milk.

1107
00:49:40,213 --> 00:49:41,809
- Well, he don't need it.

1108
00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:43,551
She kosher, she cleans.

1109
00:49:43,551 --> 00:49:46,193
That's some clean people
them kosher people.

1110
00:49:46,193 --> 00:49:47,649
That motherfucker ain't on, right?

1111
00:49:47,649 --> 00:49:48,630
- No, don't worry about the camera.

1112
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,463
It's not on.

1113
00:49:49,463 --> 00:49:50,297
- No?
- No.

1114
00:49:50,297 --> 00:49:51,488
No.

1115
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,990
- What's this nigger doing
staring in the thing?

1116
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,504
He's learning
how to use the camera.

1117
00:49:55,504 --> 00:49:56,393
- But it ain't on though, right?

1118
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:57,515
No, he's
learning how to use it

1119
00:49:57,515 --> 00:49:59,006
when we're off on break,

1120
00:49:59,006 --> 00:50:00,518
he's a student.

1121
00:50:00,518 --> 00:50:01,478
- Oh, you a student.

1122
00:50:01,478 --> 00:50:03,561
Can you get this guy a drink?

1123
00:50:03,561 --> 00:50:05,498
- Yes, uh, what do you want?

1124
00:50:05,498 --> 00:50:06,667
- Courvoisier.

1125
00:50:07,545 --> 00:50:08,808
We have Jack
Daniels, we have some-

1126
00:50:08,808 --> 00:50:11,468
- Hell, yeah! Yeah!
- Okay, okay.

1127
00:50:11,468 --> 00:50:15,150
So how do you
like our house boy?

1128
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:15,984
What you talking about?

1129
00:50:15,984 --> 00:50:18,315
- No, seriously, when I
saw you walk in the door,

1130
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,307
- What?
- I thought you were Muslim,

1131
00:50:20,307 --> 00:50:22,650
black Muslim.
- Yeah.

1132
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:23,531
- Like a Malcolm X.

1133
00:50:23,531 --> 00:50:25,953
- They're all right. They good people.

1134
00:50:25,953 --> 00:50:28,616
- But you ain't one of them?

1135
00:50:28,616 --> 00:50:30,490
- Why you gotta know so much about me?

1136
00:50:32,419 --> 00:50:34,076
- I'm just asking questions.

1137
00:50:34,076 --> 00:50:35,077
- All right now.
- Yeah.

1138
00:50:35,077 --> 00:50:36,411
- All right now.

1139
00:50:37,246 --> 00:50:38,332
What's this motherfucker doing?

1140
00:50:38,332 --> 00:50:39,802
That's Nico.

1141
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:41,609
You know that we're making
a movie about Jason.

1142
00:50:41,609 --> 00:50:42,760
I'm a movie star.

1143
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,761
It's all about Jason.

1144
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:45,678
- It's all about Jason.
- All about Jason.

1145
00:50:45,678 --> 00:50:47,204
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1146
00:50:47,204 --> 00:50:48,586
So what'd you bring me?

1147
00:50:48,586 --> 00:50:49,877
- What'd you need, baby?

1148
00:50:49,877 --> 00:50:51,846
She's doing a
movie, she wants me to talk.

1149
00:50:51,846 --> 00:50:53,618
The story of his life.

1150
00:50:53,618 --> 00:50:55,366
- "Portrait of Jason."

1151
00:50:58,946 --> 00:51:00,340
- Well, I got some of that.

1152
00:51:01,569 --> 00:51:02,512
Come here brother, let me rap to you.

1153
00:51:02,512 --> 00:51:04,321
Okay, let's see what you got.

1154
00:51:04,321 --> 00:51:06,173
Master of the ball.

1155
00:51:06,173 --> 00:51:07,805
- Look, look, look, look, here.

1156
00:51:07,805 --> 00:51:10,262
How much, how much are they
you paying you to do this shit?

1157
00:51:10,262 --> 00:51:12,740
Enough.

1158
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,392
It's a residual, a residual arrangement.

1159
00:51:15,392 --> 00:51:16,774
- What the fuck is that?

1160
00:51:16,774 --> 00:51:18,896
- More money the movie makes,

1161
00:51:18,896 --> 00:51:20,958
the more money the player takes.

1162
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:22,429
- Well, how much money
they're going to make?

1163
00:51:22,429 --> 00:51:24,181
It could be anything.

1164
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,062
- How much are you making today?

1165
00:51:25,062 --> 00:51:26,133
How much you got right now?

1166
00:51:26,133 --> 00:51:30,470
- Today I already made $500.

1167
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:31,944
- Show me some $500, nigger!

1168
00:51:34,161 --> 00:51:35,823
- This is-
- You got $500,

1169
00:51:35,823 --> 00:51:37,942
I give you everything I got.

1170
00:51:39,967 --> 00:51:41,478
What you got?

1171
00:51:41,478 --> 00:51:43,570
- I can't even tell you that

1172
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:45,582
because I don't handle my own cash.

1173
00:51:45,582 --> 00:51:46,416
That's where it's at.

1174
00:51:46,416 --> 00:51:47,975
- Well, I saw the green in her hand,

1175
00:51:47,975 --> 00:51:50,027
I didn't see it in your hand.

1176
00:51:50,027 --> 00:51:53,661
- I'm gonna give you a little bit of this

1177
00:51:54,842 --> 00:51:57,487
because that's what's going
to work for you, baby.

1178
00:51:58,856 --> 00:52:00,938
'Cause Carl said

1179
00:52:00,938 --> 00:52:02,740
that you a stone cold,

1180
00:52:05,624 --> 00:52:06,457
cold babe.

1181
00:52:09,046 --> 00:52:11,909
That's what you're looking for, right?

1182
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:12,842
- I'm tempted.

1183
00:52:12,842 --> 00:52:14,351
- I know you are, baby.

1184
00:52:14,351 --> 00:52:16,824
So I've come here to touch you up.

1185
00:52:16,824 --> 00:52:18,207
- Can we sniff it?

1186
00:52:18,207 --> 00:52:19,126
- No.

1187
00:52:19,126 --> 00:52:20,100
Sniff? Shit!

1188
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,142
This go right up inside you, baby.

1189
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,020
All the way up inside you

1190
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,005
and make you feel good.
- Oh,

1191
00:52:28,005 --> 00:52:28,909
it's tempting.

1192
00:52:30,097 --> 00:52:31,251
- It's paid for.

1193
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:32,933
It's yours.

1194
00:52:32,933 --> 00:52:33,767
You know what-

1195
00:52:33,767 --> 00:52:34,835
- Here, taste that.

1196
00:52:37,915 --> 00:52:40,027
- It's real. It's good.

1197
00:52:40,027 --> 00:52:41,278
- People like you and me,

1198
00:52:43,164 --> 00:52:45,265
we get said no to all the time.

1199
00:52:47,975 --> 00:52:50,557
Let me be the one to
tell you yes, all right?

1200
00:52:55,813 --> 00:52:56,914
You got your own shit?

1201
00:52:58,215 --> 00:52:59,316
You wanna use my shit?

1202
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,063
You act like this is the first
time you've ever done this.

1203
00:53:07,154 --> 00:53:08,068
It's right here.

1204
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,902
When was the last time
somebody paid for your shit?

1205
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:13,734
- Okay.

1206
00:53:15,052 --> 00:53:16,240
How about this one?

1207
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,975
- Oh, you like the white hose.

1208
00:53:17,975 --> 00:53:20,869
- It's pink. It's prettier.

1209
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,094
You wanna do it?

1210
00:53:24,094 --> 00:53:25,342
- No.

1211
00:53:25,342 --> 00:53:27,174
- No.
- Come on, man.

1212
00:53:27,174 --> 00:53:28,008
- No.

1213
00:53:28,008 --> 00:53:32,352
Look, there are so many
things going on in my mind.

1214
00:53:34,802 --> 00:53:35,635
Do I want it?

1215
00:53:35,635 --> 00:53:37,775
- Yes, I want it.
- Yeah.

1216
00:53:37,775 --> 00:53:39,627
- 'Cause I need thins.

1217
00:53:39,627 --> 00:53:41,238
- That's right, baby.

1218
00:53:41,238 --> 00:53:43,821
You go back in there and make your movie.

1219
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:45,052
Oh, no, no, come here, baby.

1220
00:53:45,052 --> 00:53:46,085
Come here, come here, come here.

1221
00:53:46,085 --> 00:53:47,254
What you need,

1222
00:53:47,254 --> 00:53:50,180
you need something inside you, right?

1223
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,931
I don't usually do this for nobody,

1224
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:55,082
but I'ma do it for you.

1225
00:53:58,926 --> 00:54:00,027
Pull your shirt, baby.

1226
00:54:01,728 --> 00:54:02,562
Pull your shirt.

1227
00:54:11,087 --> 00:54:12,820
Look at that right there.

1228
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,653
- See it?

1229
00:54:13,653 --> 00:54:14,972
- There you go, baby.
- See it?

1230
00:54:14,972 --> 00:54:16,753
- That's all for you.
- Mm-hmm.

1231
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,225
I got good veins.

1232
00:54:18,225 --> 00:54:20,087
- You got it good, baby.
- Mm-hmm.

1233
00:54:20,087 --> 00:54:21,979
That's
gonna make.

1234
00:54:21,979 --> 00:54:24,191
That's why they love me.

1235
00:54:24,191 --> 00:54:25,755
Who love you, baby?

1236
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:29,566
- Honey, I thought I was
getting a sparkle plenty,

1237
00:54:30,587 --> 00:54:31,471
but after-

1238
00:54:31,471 --> 00:54:32,305
- You gonna shine, baby.

1239
00:54:32,305 --> 00:54:34,901
You gonna shine.
- Oh, yeah.

1240
00:54:34,901 --> 00:54:36,651
- This is gonna put you all way there.

1241
00:54:36,651 --> 00:54:39,071
- Mm-hmm.
- All the way there.

1242
00:54:41,158 --> 00:54:42,689
Who love you?

1243
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:16,686
- Oh, Miss Lady.

1244
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:20,289
He's good
and fucked up, right?

1245
00:55:24,008 --> 00:55:25,369
All right, you're a doll.

1246
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:27,808
- Look here, I'll drop you now,

1247
00:55:27,808 --> 00:55:28,769
but I'll catch you later.

1248
00:55:31,068 --> 00:55:32,069
- Jason.

1249
00:55:32,069 --> 00:55:35,452
I only last a moment

1250
00:55:35,452 --> 00:55:38,475
then I'm gone, that's me.

1251
00:55:38,475 --> 00:55:41,083
Vacation home for wayward boys.

1252
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:43,030
So do we have a movie?

1253
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:44,081
- I think we have a movie.

1254
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:46,164
Jason, I want you to use the mantle.

1255
00:55:46,164 --> 00:55:48,005
Nico.

1256
00:55:48,005 --> 00:55:49,016
Let's go.

1257
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:50,187
Chair or drink?

1258
00:55:50,187 --> 00:55:52,161
- Both.
- Chair and drink.

1259
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:57,168
- You are a fucking faggot!

1260
00:56:00,516 --> 00:56:01,968
- Use the mantle.

1261
00:56:01,968 --> 00:56:03,719
- Sure enough, honey.

1262
00:56:11,145 --> 00:56:13,299
This is it.

1263
00:56:13,299 --> 00:56:16,052
- I never much cared for niggers.

1264
00:56:17,146 --> 00:56:18,755
Rolling

1265
00:56:20,328 --> 00:56:22,695
Tell us the
story about the cop.

1266
00:56:29,313 --> 00:56:30,147
- Momma?

1267
00:56:33,405 --> 00:56:35,162
Momma, whoo!

1268
00:56:35,162 --> 00:56:36,925
Is this making you fell good?

1269
00:56:41,517 --> 00:56:42,611
Is this entertaining them?

1270
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:43,663
Momma?

1271
00:56:43,663 --> 00:56:45,382
- What did I do?

1272
00:56:45,382 --> 00:56:48,635
What did I say to make you be this way?

1273
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:53,761
Don't turn your back on me

1274
00:56:53,761 --> 00:56:55,803
like you're Miles, Momma.

1275
00:57:02,678 --> 00:57:03,811
Keep the energy moving.

1276
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,482
How does a junkie dance?

1277
00:57:39,544 --> 00:57:41,629
A junkie dance like this.

1278
00:57:50,988 --> 00:57:52,558
I want you to go, Momma.

1279
00:57:52,558 --> 00:57:54,291
No matter what you do,

1280
00:57:54,291 --> 00:57:57,500
no matter what star you think you are,

1281
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,335
you're still my child.

1282
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:10,507
I love you, baby.

1283
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:29,036
So tell us
the story about the cop.

1284
00:58:29,036 --> 00:58:30,140
- Once upon a time...

1285
00:58:31,776 --> 00:58:34,698
An the cop with blond hair

1286
00:58:35,872 --> 00:58:36,706
and blue eyes,

1287
00:58:36,706 --> 00:58:38,225
just like I said.

1288
00:58:38,225 --> 00:58:41,358
You know about my white boy fever?

1289
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:44,168
Jason is a lazy cat.

1290
00:58:48,985 --> 00:58:50,658
Let's pretend that didn't happen.

1291
00:58:52,589 --> 00:58:54,441
Tell us about
the time you were raped

1292
00:58:54,441 --> 00:58:55,675
at Riker's Island.

1293
00:58:57,464 --> 00:59:00,147
- You're asking me questions

1294
00:59:00,147 --> 00:59:02,309
without any real

1295
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,554
meaning.

1296
00:59:05,572 --> 00:59:06,943
Why did you break your glasses

1297
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,608
and slit your wrists at Riker's?

1298
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:13,203
- Is this it?

1299
00:59:13,203 --> 00:59:14,114
Is this the moment?

1300
00:59:15,602 --> 00:59:18,034
This is where Jason's supposed to break?

1301
00:59:18,034 --> 00:59:21,158
Is this where Jason the
puppet starts to dance

1302
00:59:21,158 --> 00:59:24,381
and do whatever the
director tells him to do?

1303
00:59:24,381 --> 00:59:26,223
Is with the director wants?

1304
00:59:26,223 --> 00:59:28,105
Is this what we're here for?

1305
00:59:28,105 --> 00:59:30,097
Jason, you wouldn't
have broken your glasses

1306
00:59:30,097 --> 00:59:31,798
if you thought you were gonna live.

1307
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:36,333
- The voice in my head
that's driving me crazy

1308
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:38,292
because you're fucking with me,

1309
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:40,664
and I know you're with fucking my nerves,

1310
00:59:40,664 --> 00:59:43,530
and you're fucking with my endurance,

1311
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:46,373
fucking with my consciousness-
- Sorry-

1312
00:59:46,373 --> 00:59:48,935
- And you're fucking
with my peace of mind.

1313
00:59:48,935 --> 00:59:51,308
- Tell them what the system did to you.

1314
00:59:51,308 --> 00:59:52,721
- You're fucking,

1315
00:59:52,721 --> 00:59:54,451
fucking me up!
- You broke your own glasses

1316
00:59:54,451 --> 00:59:56,573
and slit your wrists!
- You're fucking me up!

1317
00:59:56,573 --> 00:59:59,264
- And you wanted to die.
- You are fucking me up!

1318
00:59:59,264 --> 01:00:00,098
- Because the system fucked you over.

1319
01:00:00,098 --> 01:00:02,639
- What's the motherfucking system?

1320
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:04,394
You want a system?

1321
01:00:04,394 --> 01:00:05,342
What do you got?

1322
01:00:05,342 --> 01:00:09,656
You got a schedule, you
got your fucking boom mics,

1323
01:00:09,656 --> 01:00:12,799
or whatever the fuck you call them.

1324
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:14,161
You got this-
- You were entrapped,

1325
01:00:14,161 --> 01:00:15,852
you were humiliated.
- Camera!

1326
01:00:15,852 --> 01:00:18,034
- You were put in prison.
- And you're trying to get

1327
01:00:18,034 --> 01:00:20,507
something out of me.
- You were raped.

1328
01:00:20,507 --> 01:00:21,831
- No, I was raped?

1329
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:23,553
You was raped.

1330
01:00:27,954 --> 01:00:29,906
- Okay, we now know,
now we know the truth.

1331
01:00:29,906 --> 01:00:31,027
- I'm a nigger.

1332
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:31,921
You're a nigger,

1333
01:00:32,769 --> 01:00:33,963
He's a nigger.

1334
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:35,925
She's a nigger.

1335
01:00:37,704 --> 01:00:38,538
We's a nigger.

1336
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:40,860
They's a nigger.

1337
01:00:42,078 --> 01:00:43,025
Now we know the truth,

1338
01:00:43,025 --> 01:00:44,577
and you know what the truth is?

1339
01:00:46,473 --> 01:00:47,897
You won't tell the truth.

1340
01:00:49,796 --> 01:00:51,147
- You wanna hear the truth?

1341
01:00:52,038 --> 01:00:53,820
I'm a great big star,

1342
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:57,787
but they will not admit it.

1343
01:00:58,965 --> 01:01:02,199
And this is where the scene changes

1344
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:06,042
into a more classic Hollywood scene

1345
01:01:07,354 --> 01:01:08,998
where she says,

1346
01:01:09,873 --> 01:01:11,798
"You know how to whistle.

1347
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:14,558
You just pucker up your lips and blow."

1348
01:01:18,728 --> 01:01:19,562
Roll out.

1349
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:24,820
- Okay, everyone, take five.

1350
01:01:36,894 --> 01:01:37,728
- Shirley!

1351
01:01:39,037 --> 01:01:39,982
Shirley!

1352
01:01:50,647 --> 01:01:54,344
My point is why aren't the
cameras rolling all the time?

1353
01:02:04,113 --> 01:02:07,366
This a very, very, very difficult point

1354
01:02:07,366 --> 01:02:09,998
between what the Kuchar brothers call...

1355
01:02:09,998 --> 01:02:12,284
No, actually, not even
the Kuchar brothers.

1356
01:02:12,284 --> 01:02:15,787
It was, um,.

1357
01:02:17,254 --> 01:02:20,287
It was the moment of.

1358
01:02:29,695 --> 01:02:33,196
It's like theater with
the priorities reversed,

1359
01:02:33,196 --> 01:02:34,448
that's a quote.

1360
01:02:36,481 --> 01:02:38,950
So if the cameras are not rolling,

1361
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:39,784
you're not-

1362
01:02:39,784 --> 01:02:43,074
- Bad, bad, bad, bad,
bad, bad, bad, bad you.

1363
01:02:46,523 --> 01:02:48,130
You gonna give
your man some sugar?

1364
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:48,964
- Okay.

1365
01:02:48,964 --> 01:02:50,023
- Some real sugar?
- Okay.

1366
01:02:50,023 --> 01:02:51,854
- Yeah? A little bit?

1367
01:02:51,854 --> 01:02:52,855
Yeah?
- Okay.

1368
01:02:53,859 --> 01:02:54,693
- Thank you.

1369
01:02:54,693 --> 01:02:56,903
- He's playing the fool but he's acting.

1370
01:02:56,903 --> 01:02:58,818
I need you to make it real.

1371
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:03,229
I need your help.

1372
01:03:04,471 --> 01:03:06,753
I've been shooting him for 10 hours.

1373
01:03:06,753 --> 01:03:07,767
- Where are you trying to get?

1374
01:03:07,767 --> 01:03:09,639
- I want you to break him.

1375
01:03:10,677 --> 01:03:11,511
- You want me to break him?

1376
01:03:11,511 --> 01:03:12,392
- I want you to break him.

1377
01:03:14,758 --> 01:03:17,086
Jason's my friend.

1378
01:03:18,765 --> 01:03:20,066
- I need you to break him.

1379
01:03:22,949 --> 01:03:25,455
Come on, you take the director's chair.

1380
01:03:30,837 --> 01:03:31,671
- All right.

1381
01:03:31,671 --> 01:03:32,542
- Hey, Jason!

1382
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:34,984
John!

1383
01:03:36,347 --> 01:03:37,348
- Jason.

1384
01:03:37,348 --> 01:03:40,129
Damn, boy, you high as a Georgia pine!

1385
01:03:40,989 --> 01:03:44,774
- 'Tis a far, far better world I go now

1386
01:03:44,774 --> 01:03:47,924
than I have ever gone before.

1387
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:51,137
- To be or not to be?

1388
01:03:51,137 --> 01:03:54,284
- That is rarely the question.

1389
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:00,562
Oh yes, my man!

1390
01:04:01,728 --> 01:04:04,868
- You know the truth, I know the truth.

1391
01:04:04,868 --> 01:04:06,518
- Carl.
- You're my brother.

1392
01:04:06,518 --> 01:04:07,859
- You ar ere my lover.

1393
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:09,031
Say it the right way.

1394
01:04:09,031 --> 01:04:12,308
I am your brother.
- You are my lover!

1395
01:04:12,308 --> 01:04:16,953
- She wants the same
thing all them ofays want.

1396
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,354
- Did that. Did that. Did that.

1397
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,352
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1398
01:04:20,352 --> 01:04:22,268
No you did around that.

1399
01:04:22,268 --> 01:04:23,886
She wants a tour.

1400
01:04:23,886 --> 01:04:25,004
- A tour.
- A tour of nigger-town.

1401
01:04:25,912 --> 01:04:27,490
A tour of nigger-town.

1402
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:28,895
- All aboard!

1403
01:04:28,895 --> 01:04:30,129
You got to do it.

1404
01:04:31,393 --> 01:04:32,684
You understand?

1405
01:04:32,684 --> 01:04:34,596
She wants the swanny river.

1406
01:04:34,596 --> 01:04:35,430
- Yeah.

1407
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:38,119
- She's been wearing me down.

1408
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:40,767
Apparently not enough.

1409
01:04:40,767 --> 01:04:41,601
Apparently not enough.

1410
01:04:41,601 --> 01:04:44,030
You must fix this.
- It's been a marathon, Carl.

1411
01:04:46,513 --> 01:04:47,819
I need you to wake up!

1412
01:04:52,148 --> 01:04:53,500
Kate May.

1413
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,151
- Mm-hmm.

1414
01:04:55,151 --> 01:04:57,246
Yeah, I mean,

1415
01:04:58,465 --> 01:05:01,010
I would love to love your work, I don't.

1416
01:05:02,248 --> 01:05:03,082
But

1417
01:05:04,451 --> 01:05:07,009
at least you got the looks going for you,

1418
01:05:07,009 --> 01:05:08,560
a little bit.

1419
01:05:10,396 --> 01:05:12,739
You're going around everything.

1420
01:05:12,739 --> 01:05:13,573
Get to the heart.

1421
01:05:13,573 --> 01:05:15,542
What are you afraid of?

1422
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:17,383
- Carl, what's real?

1423
01:05:17,383 --> 01:05:19,025
Teach me, Carl, what's real?

1424
01:05:19,025 --> 01:05:21,862
- What are you afraid of?
That's what I'm asking you.

1425
01:05:21,862 --> 01:05:22,696
- You know I ain't afraid.

1426
01:05:22,696 --> 01:05:23,680
- Well then cut to it.

1427
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:24,881
Give me some real shit.

1428
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:26,633
Give me something real.

1429
01:05:26,633 --> 01:05:28,888
For once in your life,

1430
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:32,689
don't be anything other than who you are.

1431
01:05:32,689 --> 01:05:34,360
Do you know who you are?

1432
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,635
Sit down.

1433
01:05:35,635 --> 01:05:36,903
Do you know what you are?

1434
01:05:36,903 --> 01:05:38,434
- Nigger, please!

1435
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,606
Fuck that shit.

1436
01:05:39,606 --> 01:05:40,767
This is Jason,

1437
01:05:40,767 --> 01:05:43,570
faggot Jason that sucked your black cock!

1438
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:44,871
Carl!

1439
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:47,487
That could
be any number of Jasons.

1440
01:05:48,346 --> 01:05:50,007
You think you're the only one?

1441
01:05:50,007 --> 01:05:51,908
- You're just like the rest of them!

1442
01:05:51,908 --> 01:05:53,573
You want me to tap dance?

1443
01:05:55,231 --> 01:06:00,236
You want me to ask, and beg
and plead for my big chance.

1444
01:06:00,777 --> 01:06:01,811
Fuck that!

1445
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,505
Carl?

1446
01:06:07,433 --> 01:06:08,947
You want me to be real?

1447
01:06:08,947 --> 01:06:12,101
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1448
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,770
- Is this is real enough for you?

1449
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:14,604
Not yet.

1450
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:15,562
- Is this real enough for you?

1451
01:06:15,562 --> 01:06:16,412
Not yet.

1452
01:06:18,595 --> 01:06:19,665
- How about that?

1453
01:06:19,665 --> 01:06:21,057
No, no.

1454
01:06:21,057 --> 01:06:22,559
- How about that?
- Nope?

1455
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,110
- Is that real?
- Nope!

1456
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:32,015
- I want you to tell
me that I'm doing okay.

1457
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:35,454
- I'll tell you you're doing
okay when you're doing okay.

1458
01:06:37,253 --> 01:06:39,415
I love you, Jason.

1459
01:06:39,415 --> 01:06:40,857
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1460
01:06:40,857 --> 01:06:41,748
I won't, I'm sorry.

1461
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:43,162
- You love me?
- I do.

1462
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:45,893
More than you love yourself.

1463
01:06:45,893 --> 01:06:48,186
You and me.
- You and me.

1464
01:06:48,186 --> 01:06:50,589
- No, no, no, no.
- Too much.

1465
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:54,210
- It wouldn't be the first time, would it?

1466
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:55,702
- Okay, okay.

1467
01:06:55,702 --> 01:06:56,620
- Oh, Carl.

1468
01:06:58,352 --> 01:06:59,555
- Watch your head, watch your head.

1469
01:06:59,555 --> 01:07:00,388
- Carl.

1470
01:07:03,756 --> 01:07:05,441
Carl.
- Yeah.

1471
01:07:05,441 --> 01:07:06,275
- Please.

1472
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,598
I gotta go home.

1473
01:07:11,598 --> 01:07:12,431
- Who are you?

1474
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:19,716
And in some other form of reality,

1475
01:07:19,716 --> 01:07:20,810
there was something,

1476
01:07:22,378 --> 01:07:24,844
some sense of another me.

1477
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:30,637
- Jason by Shirley Clark, take 50.

1478
01:07:30,637 --> 01:07:34,378
- You like to sit back
and tell your stories,

1479
01:07:34,378 --> 01:07:36,369
and great-
- That's my material, man.

1480
01:07:36,369 --> 01:07:37,203
Love it.

1481
01:07:37,203 --> 01:07:39,612
- People love my jokes.
- Yeah, absolutely.

1482
01:07:39,612 --> 01:07:41,137
- People love my-
- Life of the party.

1483
01:07:41,137 --> 01:07:43,209
Life of the party.

1484
01:07:43,209 --> 01:07:44,828
- People see me come and they say,

1485
01:07:44,828 --> 01:07:46,848
- "Oh, here's Jason."
- Yeah!

1486
01:07:46,848 --> 01:07:48,810
- "He's got some stories to tell."

1487
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:49,806
He'll tell some stories.

1488
01:07:49,806 --> 01:07:51,377
- Nico loves my stories.

1489
01:07:51,377 --> 01:07:52,321
Don't you, Nico?

1490
01:07:53,479 --> 01:07:54,510
Yeah.

1491
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:57,466
You've been laughing with
Jason all day, right?

1492
01:07:57,466 --> 01:08:00,479
You love Jason, don't you? Yeah.

1493
01:08:03,213 --> 01:08:04,047
Oh shit!

1494
01:08:05,411 --> 01:08:07,548
You want to see violence?

1495
01:08:07,548 --> 01:08:09,966
That's violence!

1496
01:08:09,966 --> 01:08:12,054
You wanna see reality?

1497
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:13,700
- All right, I think we've
all had enough of this.

1498
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,728
- Baby, this is what you've all day?

1499
01:08:15,728 --> 01:08:17,158
All day?
- All right, cut.

1500
01:08:17,158 --> 01:08:18,192
- All day, you've been doing this?

1501
01:08:18,192 --> 01:08:19,203
- The end.
- All day?

1502
01:08:19,203 --> 01:08:20,182
- The end.

1503
01:08:20,182 --> 01:08:21,016
The end.

1504
01:08:21,016 --> 01:08:23,559
End. End. End.

1505
01:08:23,559 --> 01:08:24,393
This is my film, Carl.

1506
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:25,779
You haven't been here all day

1507
01:08:25,779 --> 01:08:27,654
and you don't know what
the fuck's been on here.

1508
01:08:27,654 --> 01:08:30,617
This guy, he's just, he's drunk
everything we have, he's...

1509
01:08:31,948 --> 01:08:33,102
This is your friend.

1510
01:08:34,006 --> 01:08:35,892
- Yes, this is my friend.

1511
01:08:35,892 --> 01:08:37,413
- Yeah.
- My friend.

1512
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:39,125
- Well, I'll fix it in the edit.

1513
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:40,176
It's over now, I can't do...

1514
01:08:40,176 --> 01:08:41,963
This is the end.

1515
01:08:41,963 --> 01:08:42,797
- What?

1516
01:08:42,797 --> 01:08:44,095
- I'm sick of you controlling
me, you know that?

1517
01:08:44,095 --> 01:08:44,929
- Shut up!
- You shut up.

1518
01:08:44,929 --> 01:08:46,773
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

1519
01:08:46,773 --> 01:08:47,616
- I didn't hear that.

1520
01:08:47,616 --> 01:08:48,450
- This is my film.

1521
01:08:48,450 --> 01:08:49,284
- I didn't hear that.

1522
01:08:49,284 --> 01:08:52,108
- Yeah, well, no black girl
would this shit from you.

1523
01:08:52,108 --> 01:08:53,229
All right everyone, that's it.

1524
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,791
John, that's the end.

1525
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:56,432
Nico, it's time to go home.

1526
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:58,174
- Jason, bye.
- Jason, Jason.

1527
01:08:58,174 --> 01:08:59,115
See ya.

1528
01:08:59,115 --> 01:09:00,218
You know what?
- I'm the one

1529
01:09:00,218 --> 01:09:01,186
directing these films.

1530
01:09:01,186 --> 01:09:03,276
I don't get credit for it,

1531
01:09:03,276 --> 01:09:04,410
but I'm the one that make these films.

1532
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:05,531
She's the one who's got the Oscar.

1533
01:09:05,531 --> 01:09:06,572
- You do what you want and I'll just cut,

1534
01:09:06,572 --> 01:09:07,797
take it out in the edit.

1535
01:09:08,634 --> 01:09:09,468
Go ahead.

1536
01:09:09,468 --> 01:09:10,837
- All right, so let's go.

1537
01:09:10,837 --> 01:09:12,248
Let's go.

1538
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:13,082
Right now.

1539
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:16,983
Right now.

1540
01:09:16,983 --> 01:09:18,077
Stop crying.

1541
01:09:19,075 --> 01:09:19,909
Stop it!

1542
01:09:20,876 --> 01:09:22,048
If you believe-
- Show me.

1543
01:09:22,048 --> 01:09:23,329
Please show me, Carl.

1544
01:09:23,329 --> 01:09:24,841
If you believe I can show you.

1545
01:09:24,841 --> 01:09:26,117
- Just show me.
- What am I..

1546
01:09:26,117 --> 01:09:26,951
Show you what?

1547
01:09:26,951 --> 01:09:28,004
What am I gonna show you?

1548
01:09:28,004 --> 01:09:29,515
I love your freedom, Carl.

1549
01:09:29,515 --> 01:09:30,616
- You love my freedom?

1550
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:34,450
I bang dope.

1551
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:37,373
I look into death every day.

1552
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:38,274
And you know what?

1553
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,384
I smile.

1554
01:09:42,068 --> 01:09:42,902
You wanna be me?

1555
01:09:44,861 --> 01:09:45,805
Pay the price.

1556
01:09:47,023 --> 01:09:48,017
I'm a junkie.

1557
01:09:52,088 --> 01:09:53,182
- I'm sorry, Carl.

1558
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:56,818
- Carl, if I love anybody-
- You don't love me.

1559
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:57,651
- I love you.

1560
01:09:57,651 --> 01:09:58,485
- You might love somebody,

1561
01:09:58,485 --> 01:09:59,319
you don't love me.

1562
01:09:59,319 --> 01:10:00,153
You know what Jason is?

1563
01:10:00,153 --> 01:10:01,230
Jason' a liar.

1564
01:10:03,724 --> 01:10:04,563
He's a liar.

1565
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:07,426
Nothing worse than a liar.

1566
01:10:08,264 --> 01:10:09,889
I want some truth, nigger!

1567
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:16,494
- I need you to put the
words of my mouth, Carl.

1568
01:10:16,494 --> 01:10:17,328
- You're a grown man.

1569
01:10:17,328 --> 01:10:19,198
I ain't gonna put nothing in your mouth.

1570
01:10:22,088 --> 01:10:24,040
See that's the problem with you queens.

1571
01:10:24,981 --> 01:10:26,542
I don't mind a faggot,

1572
01:10:26,542 --> 01:10:30,329
I don't mind a faggot at
all, but a queen?

1573
01:10:30,329 --> 01:10:31,577
You can't trust them.

1574
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:35,541
You say one thing, you do another.

1575
01:10:35,541 --> 01:10:37,266
Not to be trusted.

1576
01:10:39,005 --> 01:10:40,880
And you, my friend,

1577
01:10:42,278 --> 01:10:43,292
and I do say friend,

1578
01:10:45,131 --> 01:10:46,783
are a queen of the highest order.

1579
01:10:49,255 --> 01:10:50,358
- I have a heart.

1580
01:10:50,358 --> 01:10:51,192
You have a heart?

1581
01:10:51,192 --> 01:10:53,169
- I have a heart and I have love.

1582
01:10:53,169 --> 01:10:56,185
- Don't say that, you
don't mean it. Shut up!

1583
01:10:58,475 --> 01:11:01,247
The man is speaking to you right now.

1584
01:11:01,247 --> 01:11:03,502
You sit around and get loaded in bars,

1585
01:11:04,601 --> 01:11:06,123
tell the same old stories.

1586
01:11:06,123 --> 01:11:07,732
Why doesn't anybody love?

1587
01:11:07,732 --> 01:11:09,902
Why doesn't anybody loves?

1588
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:12,560
My act, my cabaret.

1589
01:11:13,632 --> 01:11:15,454
Because you love nothing,

1590
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,584
you give nothing.

1591
01:11:18,584 --> 01:11:20,406
You're a liar.

1592
01:11:20,406 --> 01:11:22,318
and you're a phony.

1593
01:11:22,318 --> 01:11:23,152
You're a fraud.

1594
01:11:28,525 --> 01:11:30,516
You don't love yourself.

1595
01:11:30,516 --> 01:11:32,728
You don't love your act.

1596
01:11:32,728 --> 01:11:35,231
You don't love your cabaret.

1597
01:11:35,231 --> 01:11:39,078
You don't love anything or anyone, anyone!

1598
01:11:40,117 --> 01:11:44,460
And that's why you are where you are,

1599
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,062
nigger.

1600
01:11:46,062 --> 01:11:48,247
So now, so now tell me,

1601
01:11:49,495 --> 01:11:51,147
you fraud,

1602
01:11:51,147 --> 01:11:52,051
you idiot,

1603
01:11:53,069 --> 01:11:54,433
you fucking child,

1604
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:57,553
now how does that make you feel?

1605
01:12:46,735 --> 01:12:50,907
Look in the abyss, my
friend, look into the abyss,

1606
01:12:55,253 --> 01:12:57,354
'cause that's all there is.

1607
01:13:13,749 --> 01:13:15,823
- So did you get the shot?

1608
01:13:22,638 --> 01:13:25,571
- Darling, we're running
out of room at my apartment.

1609
01:13:25,571 --> 01:13:28,184
Do you mind if we all come
over here with the skylight

1610
01:13:28,184 --> 01:13:29,655
and the prettiness?

1611
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:34,103
Come on, Shirl, you're gonna
love it when they're all here.

1612
01:15:00,122 --> 01:15:02,185
- I'm sorry darling.
- Of course.

1613
01:15:02,185 --> 01:15:04,886
Look at, they're all having fun.

1614
01:15:27,858 --> 01:15:29,134
- Hey.
- Hello.

1615
01:15:29,134 --> 01:15:30,045
- Good to see you.

1616
01:15:30,045 --> 01:15:31,037
- How are you?

1617
01:15:34,968 --> 01:15:38,003
Dance. This is a great party.

1618
01:15:38,003 --> 01:15:39,155
- Where were you before?

1619
01:15:39,155 --> 01:15:40,996
- I was at, uh,

1620
01:15:40,996 --> 01:15:42,448
just like a couple of streets down,

1621
01:15:42,448 --> 01:15:43,799
it was really great.

1622
01:15:43,799 --> 01:15:45,691
But then, uh, just sort of...

1623
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,337
My way here.

1624
01:15:49,171 --> 01:15:50,127
- You ain't been in to any parties

1625
01:15:50,127 --> 01:15:52,138
in this building?
- No.

1626
01:15:52,138 --> 01:15:53,897
- This is a lot.
- No.

1627
01:15:55,141 --> 01:15:55,974
Yeah.

1628
01:15:55,974 --> 01:15:57,423
- Let's go and have fun.
- Okay.
