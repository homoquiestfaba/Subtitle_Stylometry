1
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,280
Yo, you alright?

2
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:17,318
You alright?

3
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,264
He was laying on his back there
when I came through.

4
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,379
Where the hell did he go?

5
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,519
You okay?

6
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,872
I am Matt Benton.

7
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:34,207
I've been investigating
paranormal phenomena

8
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,310
for a whole decade of my life.

9
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,114
What the fuck was that?

10
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,250
Woah, listen.

11
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:51,058
It all started
with my experience

12
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,993
at the Old Washoe Club.

13
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:56,764
I was only 16 years old.

14
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,833
I got my first interaction
with a possible entity

15
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:03,003
after asking a question
in The Crypt inside.

16
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,773
If there's a little girl here

17
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,042
please do something. Touch me.

18
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:14,582
Do make some kind of noise.
Make a tapping noise.

19
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,228
A piece of brick was thrown.

20
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,732
That day I discovered
you can get a response back

21
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:35,403
from your questions
and I was hooked.

22
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:39,239
Having that interaction
literally changed my life.

23
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,812
Since then, I've been
travelling the country

24
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,148
looking for the most
active paranormal locations,

25
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,917
documenting my findings.

26
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,632
And presenting them
on my YouTube channel,

27
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,300
Devil's Hour Productions.

28
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,870
Every paranormal investigator

29
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:13,641
is looking for that next
level of paranormal activity,

30
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,809
that Holy Grail location.

31
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,178
...and like blocked out
that window.

32
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,251
That was a big one.

33
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:28,021
July 19th, 2013.

34
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,691
The Hollywood film The Conjuring

35
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,896
took the world by storm.

36
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,899
A critically acclaimed
horror film based on

37
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,602
the haunting of
the Harrisville Farmhouse.

38
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,071
Through the perspectives
of the Perron family,

39
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:47,274
including Ed
and Lorraine Warren.

40
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:50,844
Every investigator has heard
about the Warrens.

41
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:53,346
They are pioneers
of the paranormal.

42
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,749
That's probably
the worst thing

43
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,785
we have in this whole museum.

44
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:00,253
That Raggedy Ann doll
was given to a nurse

45
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,491
in 1970 by her mother
as a Christmas present.

46
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,593
I have researched
some of their cases

47
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:08,529
and one of them was
the Harrisville Farmhouse.

48
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:11,198
The kind of activity
they reported having there

49
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,267
is what I would call next level.

50
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,136
So that we would
then leave the house,

51
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,071
evaluate our findings,

52
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,808
and decide what it is
we can do to help the family.

53
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,677
If indeed there was anything
that we could do to help them.

54
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:28,549
In this case, I do not believe
that any exorcism

55
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:31,018
or any ritual
of a religious nature

56
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,921
or any one could
ever clear that home

57
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,557
of the very negative spirits

58
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,225
which are involved in it.

59
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:42,195
We have both human
and inhuman spirits in this home

60
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,865
which are bringing about
these destructive acts.

61
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,366
Destructive acts.

62
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,202
Destructive acts.
Destructive acts.

63
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,542
This farmhouse
piqued my interest.

64
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:58,345
Is this house truly
that next level location?

65
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,014
I really wanted to investigate

66
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:03,851
the extraordinary claims
of levitation

67
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,520
possession,

68
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,189
apparitions

69
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,258
and physical attacks.

70
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:18,666
At the time, however,
the Harrisville Farmhouse owner

71
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,468
was not allowing
investigations at the house.

72
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,738
It wasn't until October 2019,

73
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:27,407
I discovered that
paranormal investigators

74
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,342
Cory and Jennifer Heinzen

75
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,211
had purchased the property.

76
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:38,218
This gave me hope of getting
access to film a documentary

77
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,589
at the infamous
Harrisville Farmhouse.

78
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:45,092
I then told my friend,
Joe Vitale,

79
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,994
who has over 20 years
of experience

80
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,696
investigating the paranormal

81
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,564
and runs his own
YouTube channel,

82
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:52,866
Entity Seven Paranormal.

83
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,168
He was wanting to
investigate the property

84
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,937
just as much as I did,

85
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,006
so we agreed to
film there together

86
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,741
as soon as possible.

87
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,976
I got in contact
with the Heinzens

88
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,444
and they gave us permission

89
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,313
and the dates
we could film there.

90
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,583
We were all set,

91
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:13,520
except my team could not make it
due to personal reasons.

92
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,858
So we decided to gather a team
of four paranormal YouTubers.

93
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,560
Joe and I,

94
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:24,364
Billy Cook
from Paranormal Pursuit

95
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,303
and Eric Connor
from Epic Paranormal TV.

96
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,275
The four of us
have very different

97
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,377
styles of investigating.

98
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,212
Joe is very old school
in the ways of

99
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,914
paranormal investigating.

100
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:43,516
Billy is the more grounded
one in the group.

101
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,319
Eric is very energetic
and spiritual,

102
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,321
the 100% believer.

103
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,357
Others say
I'm the more scientific minded

104
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,792
investigator of the team

105
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,394
and willing to put myself
in dangerous situations.

106
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,067
March 16th, 2020.

107
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,530
I'm in Massachusetts.

108
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,533
For the first time in my life,
I'm in Massachusetts.

109
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,568
And I'm on the
way to our location,

110
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:38,806
to the-- the conjuring house,
the real conjuring house.

111
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,074
This is the house
where the events of

112
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,643
the Conjuring movie
one took place.

113
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:46,714
This is the place where Ed and
Lorraine Warren investigated.

114
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:49,349
So I'm on my way to meet up
with Matt, Joe and Billy.

115
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,985
They're already at the location,
to my knowledge,

116
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,821
so I'll be arriving
there shortly.

117
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,322
I'm very excited,
I've, like I said,

118
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,857
I've never even
been in the state.

119
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,325
I've never been this far north

120
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:00,393
and I've never been
to this location.

121
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,429
And I've also never investigated

122
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,831
with Matt or with Billy.

123
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,833
We've all talked online,
you know, plenty.

124
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,567
But this will be our first time

125
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,668
investigating
a location together.

126
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,070
And we've got two days.

127
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,671
We've got two days
and two nights.

128
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:12,873
We got it all.

129
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:15,142
It's going to be--
It's going to be lit.

130
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,609
So let's go. Let's get it.

131
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,245
My heart's beating a little bit.

132
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,080
A little bit racing here.

133
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:23,183
I did my homework
on this location,

134
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,519
so I know the potential

135
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,522
of what we might be
walking into.

136
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,526
The day has finally come

137
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,930
where we set foot on the
Harrisville Farmhouse property

138
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,832
for the very first time.

139
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,876
We wanted to uncover
the real history

140
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,411
and experiences of the house.

141
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,281
So we interviewed
Keith and Carl Johnson,

142
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,449
the first paranormal
investigators

143
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:59,953
and demonologists to
ever investigate the house.

144
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,956
Next, we interviewed
Cory Heinzen,

145
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,092
the current owner
of the farmhouse,

146
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,194
as well as John Huntington,

147
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,329
also a paranormal investigator.

148
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,865
He investigated the house
the longest

149
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,566
and lived there for nine months

150
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,969
with the Heinzens
as a caretaker.

151
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:18,738
Lastly, Andrea Perron
was interviewed.

152
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:21,241
She experienced
this infamous haunting

153
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,911
first-hand for ten years
on the property.

154
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,579
Her story is the reason
why we are here.

155
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,317
What kind of led
you on a path that

156
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,619
you finally were able
to come to this house?

157
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,121
What brought you to this house?

158
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:39,192
It was in the early 1970s,
1973, actually.

159
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,062
And I was part
of an organization.

160
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,297
My brother and I,
my brother Carl,

161
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,599
were members of P.I.R.O

162
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,768
based at Rhode Island College.

163
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:52,605
Parapsychological Investigation
and Research Organization.

164
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,375
And as I said,
there was no Internet back then.

165
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,845
So how do I get
the word out that

166
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,180
we do investigations
free of charge?

167
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:03,550
So I just illustrated
a little ad myself,

168
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:07,254
put it in a local newspaper,
and it was three weeks later,

169
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,690
to the day actually
that it was answered by

170
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:14,761
Mrs. Carolyn Perron
in Harrisville Rhode Island.

171
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:18,165
And she said she had moved
in a couple of years ago

172
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,368
to a house that
was built in 1736

173
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:26,139
and things were happening that
were becoming very terrifying,

174
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,975
downright terrifying.

175
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,077
And she was wondering
if we could come

176
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,512
and check out her situation.

177
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:36,884
Logic tells you that
something that is immaterial,

178
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:40,820
that there's a shadow
or something else,

179
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:43,090
that wind that passes by you,
it lifts your hair.

180
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,926
It cannot really hurt you.

181
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,096
I still feel threatened.
I feel threatened.

182
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,365
As soon as we arrived
on the property,

183
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,634
we felt almost like a barrier.

184
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:57,905
It was like a barrier
when we stepped out of the car,

185
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,573
the atmosphere
was very different.

186
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,610
I mean, nice family,
the Perron family,

187
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,612
very nice people,
all American family.

188
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:08,648
Yet the property
and the house itself,

189
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,451
you really felt that
something was kind of wrong.

190
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,322
It was like a very, very
negative energy we sensed

191
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,158
and I believed it to
not be a human spirit.

192
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,393
I believed it to be
an inhuman spirit,

193
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,995
a demon, if you will.

194
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,332
So Carolyn Perron was
most affected by this

195
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,400
whatever the house had.

196
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,570
She would awaken with scratches
on her arms and torso,

197
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,306
and she was visibly shrinking.

198
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,942
She was losing weight rapidly,

199
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,044
so it was affecting
her profoundly.

200
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:40,347
A coat hanger
came down from the rack.

201
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,083
I didn't bump it, I didn't
touch it, I wasn't near it.

202
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,884
I was bending over at the time.

203
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,687
Came down off the rack, and
started pounding me on the head,

204
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,922
six or eight times.

205
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,760
I needed--
And we had seen things.

206
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,896
We had seen my mother
under attack

207
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,866
in the closet downstairs
off the bathroom.

208
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,636
Beaten inexplicably
with a wooden coat hanger

209
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,905
after stepping
out of the shower.

210
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,474
And she started screaming

211
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:10,777
and we all ran in to see
what was wrong with mom,

212
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:14,214
including our neighbour
that had stopped by with a cake.

213
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:18,285
And she saw it too, and
never came back to the house.

214
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,221
But, you know,
my mother was attacked

215
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,590
physically a number of times.

216
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,458
Have you met the Perrons?

217
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:28,095
Yes, we've been able to meet
all the Perrons

218
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,530
except for Carolyn.

219
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,832
Carolyn refuses
to come back up here.

220
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:36,669
And there was a sister that
passed away a few years ago,

221
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,838
unfortunately,
that we weren't able to meet.

222
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,509
Yeah, they had them all up here
a few months ago.

223
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,378
And that was-- You could tell--

224
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:48,248
Like you can tell when somebody
has been through something

225
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,850
and they had certainly
been through something.

226
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,354
Mr. McKeachern

227
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:57,857
who was a historian
in his nineties,

228
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,327
when we moved there,

229
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,329
he came and introduced himself

230
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:03,997
to my mother and our family.

231
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:07,567
The spirit that was haunting
my mother clearly

232
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,269
had a broken neck

233
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,804
hanging literally
off the side of her dress.

234
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,342
And Mr. McKeachern
told my mother

235
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,111
that it was Mrs. Arnold,
and their farm hand

236
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:21,414
took her body down
and moved her into the house

237
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,351
so that she would
be able to be buried

238
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,887
in the family plot
in the cemetery

239
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,557
rather than being excluded

240
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,625
because she had
taken her own life.

241
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,727
Carolyn Perron did have a very

242
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:36,896
disturbing experience
in her bedroom

243
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,966
where one morning it was shortly
after our first visit,

244
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,735
it was about 5:15
in the morning, she woke up

245
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,671
and there was
something in her room.

246
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:48,541
She smelled the scent of sulphur
and decaying mingled.

247
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,844
There was something
even fizzling for a moment

248
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,113
on her dresser,

249
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:54,914
some kind of light.

250
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,516
But then she looked over
and there's this--

251
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,918
It's very difficult to describe
what she saw,

252
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,520
some kind of monstrosity

253
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:04,324
and vaguely in the shape
of a female apparition

254
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,025
wearing a long gray dress.

255
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,895
But the head was
cocked to one side

256
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,164
on the shoulder as if the neck
had been broken,

257
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,101
and it began chanting to her.

258
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:18,037
"I'll drive you mad
with fiery brooms.

259
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,373
I'll drive you mad
with death and gloom.

260
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,275
I'll drive you out

261
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,843
but it will be too late.

262
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,545
You'll be dead."

263
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,647
And then it just leered
at her and vanished.

264
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,617
A myth surrounds
the Harrisville Farmhouse

265
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,353
involving Bathsheba Sherman.

266
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,223
People claim
she was a witch and a Satanist

267
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:39,159
who murdered a baby
with a sewing needle.

268
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,760
Through research, however,

269
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,196
this appears to be far
from the truth.

270
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,735
Bathsheba Thayer Sherman Greene

271
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:51,238
was a actual historical person.

272
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:54,641
She was a resident
of Harrisville.

273
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,377
She was a member of
the Harrisville Baptist Church

274
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,011
at the time of her life.

275
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,648
She married Judson Sherman.

276
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,950
They had a rather
prosperous farm.

277
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:08,555
And somehow--
Somehow, we don't know how,

278
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,324
rumours started up
about her years ago,

279
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,127
quite a long time ago,

280
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:17,130
she was accused of
being a satanic witch

281
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,633
and supposedly
had killed a baby here.

282
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,035
Sacrificed it,
made it look like an accident

283
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:26,506
by impaling it
with a sewing needle.

284
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:31,077
And there's been a lot
of research done on that.

285
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,746
And there's been no
actual historical evidence

286
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,682
that that ever happened.

287
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,817
We contacted Kenny Biddle,

288
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,386
a researcher and writer

289
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:43,223
who has spent a year researching
the history of the farmhouse.

290
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:44,857
He will give us the facts

291
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,494
of the authentic history
of the property.

292
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:51,531
If Bathsheba was an evil witch
that killed a baby,

293
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,733
it would be in her obituary.

294
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,803
That's what they put
in those obituaries back then.

295
00:18:57,204 --> 00:19:00,373
They told your--
They condensed your life story

296
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,142
with the highlights
in that obituary.

297
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,558
So I guarantee, without a doubt,

298
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:19,992
if she had murdered a baby,

299
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,595
it would be in that obituary.

300
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,764
On top of that, it's like

301
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,999
back then they took
that seriously if they--

302
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,868
You were considered a witch,

303
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,670
you would have
been shamed for it

304
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,071
and even killed for it.

305
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,642
Definitely won't be buried
in a Baptist cemetery.

306
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,477
She would be in the newspapers.

307
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,713
We should be able to find
newspaper articles about this,

308
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,616
but there was nothing.

309
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,752
But unfortunately,
between the movie

310
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,920
and the books that
were written about it,

311
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:50,290
and then the hundreds
of YouTube channels

312
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:53,125
that just repeat
shit ad nauseam.

313
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,528
This is the story
that's out there.

314
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:56,929
This is what people know.

315
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,531
It's the common knowledge now,

316
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:01,534
and it's an uphill battle
for people like me

317
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:06,172
and documentaries like this
to present the real history.

318
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:11,778
The only death
that was on the property

319
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:15,582
was Jarvis Smith
was a man that he was--

320
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,719
He was walking along and
he actually-- It was wintertime.

321
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,788
It sounds like he was drunk

322
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,891
and he took shelter
in one of their sheds,

323
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,459
a shed that's no longer there

324
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,561
that's been gone for decades.

325
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:31,631
But he was there
and he died overnight.

326
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,866
He froze to death
on the property.

327
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,404
No unusual history
of deaths from the farmhouse,

328
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:40,873
however, before the Harrisville
Farmhouse was built,

329
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,277
King Philip's war took place
throughout Massachusetts

330
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,645
and Rhode Island.

331
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:49,048
From 1675 through 1678,

332
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,851
the Narragansett
and Wampanoag tribes

333
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:54,754
fought a brutal war
with the colonists.

334
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:58,057
Thousands were left dead,
villages were torched,

335
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,594
women and children
murdered and buried alive,

336
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:04,997
leaving the farmhouse land
possibly haunted.

337
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:13,340
It was actually P.I.R.O

338
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,543
who contacted the Warrens
about the situation here.

339
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,712
And we were here first
and investigated

340
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,882
and of course, experienced
quite a bit of activity here.

341
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,653
And we sat down at our
next meeting and said,

342
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,456
"I really," you know,
we were talking about

343
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,524
how we should call in
Ed and Lorraine Warren

344
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:33,292
just to see what their take was.

345
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:35,695
Actually,
Lorraine Warren arranged

346
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,930
something I personally
would not recommend,

347
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,833
she recommended
that they arrange a séance

348
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:42,935
which took place
right in this room,

349
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,671
right where we're sitting now.

350
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:47,607
And of course, Carolyn Perron
was going to be the conduit.

351
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:50,276
She was the one that
was going to communicate

352
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,579
since the spirit
was oppressing her.

353
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:56,315
Lorraine thought perhaps this
spirit, if they hold a séance,

354
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,451
and they had another
psychic medium here as well

355
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,353
that was actually
conducting the séance,

356
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,322
and they hoped that the spirit
would communicate

357
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,492
through Carolyn Perron
and say what it wanted.

358
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:08,327
My father didn't want to
have anything to do with that.

359
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:11,531
He strenuously objected

360
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:15,735
to the ritual going forward.

361
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:20,773
It took Ed Warren as a priest
quite a while to convince him

362
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:23,576
that it was necessary.

363
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,646
And then the mediums
started conjuring the spirit.

364
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,482
That's where the name
of the film came from.

365
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,219
And in the process
of doing that,

366
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,655
she collapsed unconscious
on the table,

367
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,558
the table rose up
and came back down on the floor.

368
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:42,261
My mother started
howling like a banshee,

369
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,363
she started speaking
in a language

370
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:46,966
that does not exist
on this earth.

371
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,969
The chair that she was in
raised up off the floor

372
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:54,474
and in a split second
she and the chair were tossed

373
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:56,643
from the middle
of the dining room

374
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,745
into the middle of the parlor.

375
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:01,714
Literally thrown off the chair
halfway across the room,

376
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:05,017
wound up crumpled on the floor.

377
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,754
To all appearances she had,
she was dead.

378
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,591
She wasn't showing
any life signs at all.

379
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,961
And of course,
Roger ran over to revive her

380
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,063
and she did start
breathing again.

381
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,198
Meanwhile,
Ed Warren advised him,

382
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,368
"You really shouldn't touch
the possessed at this point."

383
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,703
And that's where Roger lost it,

384
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:28,908
he dismissed the Warrens
very, very adamantly.

385
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:32,178
He actually literally
threw Ed out of the house.

386
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,614
And that's how
it culminated there,

387
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:37,316
their involvement in this case.

388
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,619
And everyone present
in the house heard

389
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:42,088
my mother sulk at that floor

390
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:46,125
and everyone present in that
house thought she had died.

391
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,261
It was a nightmare.

392
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:51,964
It was the worst moments
of my life

393
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:54,000
that shouldn't
have even happened.

394
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,168
It's my personal opinion,
though.

395
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:59,506
Have you had anybody
that's scared to investigate

396
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:00,973
after coming here?

397
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:04,343
We've had a few teams leave
in the middle of the night.

398
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:08,648
Just because, you know,
it gets too real too soon.

399
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,717
Some people just
aren't ready for it.

400
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,351
You know, they just think
it's just going to be

401
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,353
one of those run of the mill,
you know, hauntings.

402
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:17,524
And it's pretty much
up in your face.

403
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:22,194
I hear you out there.

404
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,738
I saw it move a little bit.

405
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,188
Oh, fuck.

406
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,290
Holy fuck.

407
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,529
That's fucking scary.

408
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:03,836
Okay, John, tell us a little bit

409
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,272
about some of the experiences
you've had in this house.

410
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:10,309
Scariest thing is I had
a voice yell hello at me.

411
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,546
I came out here and I heard
a bunch of rustling around

412
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,981
and stuff and banging

413
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,249
and sounded like someone
was going through something.

414
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,586
So I just kind of went
quietly walked back,

415
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,053
got my phone, started recording

416
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:23,590
and then I heard a girl
say hello out loud,

417
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,392
which kind of startled me.

418
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:45,144
I heard some knocking
and banging sounds

419
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:47,580
When I walked through
a minute ago.

420
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,316
So I thought just grab
my camera.

421
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,418
It's a car going by.

422
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,120
Hello.

423
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:56,789
What the fuck?

424
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:58,925
Hello?

425
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:02,795
Goosebumps.

426
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,669
I also had like a toy car
come off from the chairs.

427
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:32,024
And the library book
came off the shelf.

428
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,694
I'd just gotten up
in the morning

429
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:36,195
and noticed it on the floor.

430
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,798
And I came right back
and asked Bill if,

431
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:39,966
you know, did you see a--

432
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41,467
Was there a book
on the floor yesterday?

433
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,302
You know, we reviewed
the tape and sure enough,

434
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,571
it just came
right off the shelf.

435
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,247
What kind of tools,
investigator wise,

436
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,716
have you had successfully?

437
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:59,285
We had our DR16 here
a few weeks ago,

438
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:01,020
we got some pretty crazy stuff.

439
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,255
Alright, I'm just going to ask
who is here with us,

440
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,523
because this is crazy.

441
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,827
Alright, here we go, guys.

442
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,731
Oh, it's full.

443
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:14,600
Okay, we're going to
leave that on.

444
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:18,971
Okay, recording now.

445
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,942
Who is here with us?

446
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:34,987
Who is here with us?

447
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:39,458
Fuck you.

448
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:49,101
Did I just hear a--

449
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:52,238
Did I just hear what I--
What I think I heard?

450
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:56,909
...is here with us?

451
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:58,510
I haven't slowed
what sound is coming.

452
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:01,881
Fuck you.

453
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,416
Fuck!

454
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:09,688
Oh, something's not happy, guys.
Something is not happy.

455
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:17,063
Fuck you.

456
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:19,431
Oh, my God, dude.

457
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,735
Oh, my God.

458
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,573
That was a little alarming,
guys, to be honest.

459
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:31,343
I almost want to say
it was common place

460
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:35,347
to see things move
on their own.

461
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,933
Oh God,
we all came to this place,

462
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:56,168
we came in peace,
and we leave in peace.

463
00:28:56,969 --> 00:29:01,007
Taking nothing unholy
or unnatural with us

464
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:09,816
And we pray for
our safety tonight.

465
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:12,151
That they may be kept safe

466
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,887
and they mean
no harm, no danger

467
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:18,290
as they explore
the wonders of creation.

468
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:20,226
We pray to your holy name.

469
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:25,231
Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

470
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,851
Before the investigation,

471
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:47,253
our friend, Jason Emerick,

472
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:51,590
an investigator and medium,
had given Joe a warning

473
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,494
that I was not told about
for experimental purposes.

474
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,330
And he's going to see if he can
communicate with the spirits

475
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:02,234
from here at his place.

476
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:03,335
Got you.

477
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:05,071
And right now,

478
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:10,309
I'm not going to say what he's
telling me right now just yet.

479
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,111
Here, do you want
to film it, though?

480
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,046
-Go ahead and film it.
-But it was interesting.

481
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,448
So that way they can see
what time it's at

482
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,218
you know, before everything.

483
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,192
At around 8 p.m.,

484
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:04,030
we commenced our investigation
in the basement.

485
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:08,234
Eric was live on his YouTube
channel during the first hour.

486
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:12,804
This is what was captured
on night-one in the house.

487
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:15,942
Immediately,
that same feeling in here.

488
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:17,443
I just had the same
exact feeling I got

489
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,278
when I walked in here
the first time.

490
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:22,114
There is energy in this room.

491
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:24,316
That's it, Bill.
That's the well.

492
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,752
Wow.

493
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,523
Yeah, there's a clear,
concise energy in here

494
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,093
that I can just feel
as soon as we get here.

495
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:36,428
And there's obviously,
like a change in temperature,

496
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:38,897
like it's cooler in this room,
the air's crisper in this room.

497
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:41,833
But there's something else too,
there's almost like a static

498
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,435
energy on top of the air.

499
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:44,937
-Woah, woah, woah.
-Within the air.

500
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:46,572
It's clear too.

501
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:48,907
Here, I'm going to restart.

502
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:53,112
-Ready?
-Yes, sir.

503
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:59,051
Do you get any energy
from this well,

504
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:00,452
from this water source?

505
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,499
I didn't feel the energy
in here, like clearly.

506
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,235
It feels like
it is natural energy.

507
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,604
I'm not feeling
any kind of like presence,

508
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:21,707
but I'm feeling just like
a whole bunch of energy.

509
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,542
I have to be very careful.

510
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:25,244
I have face tracking
on my cameras,

511
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,646
and my phones and stuff,
and in my basement, it'll--

512
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,747
What are you doing?

513
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,282
You just stepped
right into the well.

514
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:31,917
Actually,
what if I go down there?

515
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,621
You ain't getting back up.

516
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:37,756
-Okay, let's do this.
-I'll help you.

517
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,825
-Are you really doing it?
-Sure.

518
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:41,327
Oh, goodness.

519
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,462
Dude, you're going to lose
some equipment in that well.

520
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:45,731
Definitely going to fall off.

521
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:47,299
-Are you going to hang like--
-Hang.

522
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,402
How it's going to work?
Whistle or EVP?

523
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:51,737
Yeah.

524
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,040
If we're not
capturing his death,

525
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:55,141
it's not worth it.

526
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:04,016
He's an extreme investigator
for a reason, y'all.

527
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:07,886
Dude, that's not
going to work.

528
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,455
Be very, very careful.

529
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:12,591
I hope that he falls.

530
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:14,993
Yeah, if he falls, you and me
are picking him out of there,

531
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:16,895
-so get ready.
-Me and you who?

532
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,331
Can someone put
a flash light at me?

533
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,634
-Yeah, I got you. Hold on.
-Let me see what I got.

534
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,103
Here.

535
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:30,209
At this moment,

536
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:33,879
we capture a possible
disembodied voice

537
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:36,948
The torch.

538
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,252
The torch.

539
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,789
The torch.

540
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:49,561
This voice is so clear
and has human tone to it.

541
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:52,464
We start to think that
it could have been one of us.

542
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:54,166
When reviewing all the video,

543
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,868
we don't see
any of our lips move.

544
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:59,037
But Billy and I
are both facing away

545
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:01,307
from the cameras
during this moment.

546
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,742
The torch.

547
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,144
The torch.

548
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,247
The torch.

549
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,849
The thing that is odd
about this, though,

550
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,418
is that as Americans,

551
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:16,021
we do not typically
call flash lights, torches.

552
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,724
So it doesn't seem
like our characteristics

553
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:21,593
and none of us
remember saying this.

554
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:24,396
So we're leaving this
up to you to decide.

555
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,307
Like, I wonder if they've
got a camera or something?

556
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:36,942
Here, do you need
any help out of there?

557
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:38,644
-Got it.
-Got it? Okay.

558
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,747
So, guys, Matt seriously

559
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,250
does extreme paranormal
investigations.

560
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:45,617
He goes for it.

561
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:49,355
All of us were like,
"Well, no, no," but he did it.

562
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:52,090
Something's wrong with that rec,
let's do one more rec, okay?

563
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:53,325
Alright, here we go.

564
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:58,497
We're going to be here
for a while.

565
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,200
Do you have any messages
or warnings for us?

566
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:12,711
That's weird. Alright,
so if the doorway is open,

567
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,546
will you say doorway, please?

568
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:23,455
You alright?

569
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,258
-What happened?
-I don't know.

570
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:28,227
I'll say I got really dizzy
for a second.

571
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:30,061
How are you feeling now?

572
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:31,463
I'm feeling okay now.

573
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,337
That was weird, right?
When you said that.

574
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,172
Yeah, that whole
session was weird.

575
00:35:40,206 --> 00:35:42,208
Dude right when you said
that though, I had like--

576
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:44,743
I just, like, felt like my--

577
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,245
Like my eyes just rolled back

578
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:47,946
and then I got
really dizzy for a second.

579
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,281
That was weird.

580
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,682
That's scary.

581
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:52,984
When I said, what,
the doorway thing?

582
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,152
Yeah.

583
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,191
Oh, oh, hey.

584
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:01,793
Come here. Right this way.

585
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:05,130
-What's that?
-No, maybe it was a tree.

586
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,698
-Is there a tree?
-No.

587
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:08,434
What the hell was that then?

588
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:10,236
And I thought that
was a Christmas tree.

589
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:13,239
I thought there was
a Christmas tree right here.

590
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:14,540
-You saw a shadow?
-Yeah.

591
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:16,308
It looks like a Christmas tree
was right here.

592
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:17,943
And then,
all of a sudden it moved.

593
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:19,711
And then I thought
it was the lighting.

594
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:21,580
-But no, it was--
-Is there a camera?

595
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:22,914
Security camera somewhere here?

596
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,583
-Oh, yes, yes, yes.
-Where?

597
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:25,951
I thought
I installed some.

598
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,320
-No, not here.
-Oh, it's here at the steps.

599
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:30,689
But it was the craziest
thing because I thought...

600
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,123
There's one at the very end.

601
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:34,192
I thought it was
a Christmas tree.

602
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:35,727
And from your--

603
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:37,629
From your lighting, when you
were messing with the lighting,

604
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:39,064
it looked like maybe it was,

605
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:41,867
you know,
when you brighten the light,

606
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,069
it then make the shadows
kind of move a little bit.

607
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:45,404
That's what I thought
was happening.

608
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:47,005
And I was like, "Oh, no,
it's just a Christmas tree."

609
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,275
And then I noticed that there's
not a Christmas tree here.

610
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:51,610
It was-- That's what
it looked like to me.

611
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,379
-That's pretty wild.
-Hold on, Matt.

612
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:56,348
Where does this one go to?

613
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,784
-It's blocked off.
-No.

614
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,652
-They're locked up.
-We can't go through that.

615
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:07,192
About 22 minutes later,
we head up to the second floor

616
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:11,196
and we experience something
absolutely fascinating.

617
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,098
This is my first time.

618
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:19,104
Holy cow!

619
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:22,774
Please, dude.

620
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:29,881
Hello.

621
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,690
-Was that Matt?
-Yeah.

622
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,160
He shut the door
and locked himself in.

623
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:47,766
Oh, I can unlock it.

624
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,369
Bro.

625
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:52,504
-I want to be in here.
-You want some solo time?

626
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:54,072
-Yeah.
-Alright.

627
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,976
He's alright.
He's just doing some solo work.

628
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:27,339
Anyone in here with me?

629
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:34,680
That's right, Eric.
That's the area.

630
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,648
This set up? Everything?

631
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,089
Can you move something?

632
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,125
Can you move this stuff
right now?

633
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,603
Can you show yourself right now?

634
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:04,309
Crooked-neck lady.

635
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:09,681
Crooked-neck lady.

636
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,719
Come forth.

637
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:15,821
Into the gateway
in the black mirror.

638
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,188
Maybe restart it.

639
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:22,661
You said that's good.

640
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:36,207
A little help right here.

641
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:54,059
I felt dizzy again.
That was interesting.

642
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,865
We're trying to get
in contact with you.

643
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:04,069
We are giving you permission
to make your presence known.

644
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,484
-Guys?
-Woah, woah!

645
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:54,820
You didn't see that?

646
00:40:54,853 --> 00:40:57,255
A bug just flew
and landed on my hand.

647
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,858
Guys?

648
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,627
Yeah, I saw it come
through but really,

649
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,161
it looked like
a little black circle.

650
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:06,097
-Like, it landed on my hand.
-Do you think it's a bug?

651
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,967
You sure it was a bug
or was it a black circle?

652
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,135
Hey, guys.

653
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:11,803
Oh, my God.

654
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:14,606
Matt, why do you do this?

655
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:17,142
What's up?
Wait, wait, how do this--

656
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,209
How does this work?

657
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,879
What's good, my man?
What's good?

658
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,716
Come check this out.

659
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:27,218
We're on the way.

660
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:31,322
Please don't change it.

661
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,702
Alright, so we just got
walkied in over here.

662
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:46,071
What's going down?

663
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:48,039
Look how coincidental this is.

664
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:52,944
-I didn't even touch it.
-What? What do we got?

665
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:55,947
Oh, my God. Look, look.

666
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,617
-Look.
-I just thought that was weird.

667
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,586
I was-- And you were
recording when you came in here.

668
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:02,554
So we'll be able to see
that you came straight in.

669
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:04,790
Actually, I even recorded
me walking towards it too.

670
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:08,760
And so there are no cuts,
no cuts.

671
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:11,262
-Look at that.
-Okay.

672
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:14,700
Bro, is it not crazy?
That's crazy.

673
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:17,569
So I just noticed that
when I was walking down there.

674
00:42:17,603 --> 00:42:20,939
That is-- That is wild, dude.
That's wild.

675
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,942
No cuts. No cuts.

676
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,812
Seven.

677
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:28,346
Seven.

678
00:42:29,314 --> 00:42:31,149
I am seven.

679
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:34,319
You are nothing.

680
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:37,856
Seven.

681
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:42,093
A possible demonic entity
that Joe, Eric and myself

682
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:45,530
have experienced
in past investigations.

683
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,934
It seems to follow us
to different locations.

684
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:51,937
With Jason's warning
to Joe about seven,

685
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,872
could it be the entity

686
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,608
or is it referencing
the seven soldiers

687
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:59,077
said to be buried
behind the wall?

688
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,780
And they're all saying
together at once.

689
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:05,083
"There are seven dead
soldiers buried in the wall."

690
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:07,953
"There are seven dead
soldiers buried in the wall."

691
00:43:07,986 --> 00:43:12,457
And is the block
a coincidence or a sign?

692
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:14,760
I think you would have
noticed that, though.

693
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:17,128
I would have made a big deal
about it if I noticed it.

694
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:18,630
But I'm saying, like,
what if I like filmed,

695
00:43:18,664 --> 00:43:20,031
it wasn't, you know
what I mean, like--

696
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:23,001
Even though like
it was most likely not moved

697
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:24,736
like since we've been here

698
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,038
but I just thought
it was a weird ass coincidence.

699
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:29,174
-Oh, yeah, I know.
-Yeah.

700
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:30,909
That thing is pretty strange.

701
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,711
Literally the number--

702
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:34,612
And you walked in here
by yourself and saw it.

703
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:36,748
No wonder you radioed us.
That makes sense.

704
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:38,416
No, I just wanted you
to see what was up.

705
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,951
I mean, I was kind of cool.

706
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:42,587
It seems like a sign.
It seems like a sign.

707
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,555
Especially, we're going to
show you some stuff later.

708
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:45,824
I don't know when

709
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:47,625
but Joe and me will have
to show you at some point

710
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:49,527
and you know,
it'll all come together.

711
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,396
It'll all be very,

712
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:54,065
very informative.

713
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:56,534
Should you
be sharing the--

714
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,204
Your, what,
your session also at first?

715
00:43:59,237 --> 00:44:01,472
Or what--
Or Jason Emerick's first?

716
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:05,210
-Let's do--
-Any relations to any of two?

717
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:06,678
I feel like--

718
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:08,947
I feel like I should do--

719
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,182
-I should do a tarot reading.
-Oh, shit!

720
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:13,251
-What? What? What?
-The rocking chair.

721
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:15,320
-It's moving. It's moving.
-Move, move, move.

722
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:19,991
Okay, jump around.

723
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:21,292
Jump around.

724
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:25,163
Okay. Yes, it was moving.
It was fucking moving.

725
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:26,397
-I caught a little bit.
-Hold on.

726
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:28,033
-I got it, I got it.
-I'll go this side.

727
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:29,334
I got a little bit of it.

728
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:30,736
The boards don't go
all the way through there.

729
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:32,470
Okay, back up, guys.
Let's back up.

730
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,604
-I gotta try.
-Give us some space.

731
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:34,806
Give us some space for a bit.

732
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,407
We'll try and debunk after this.

733
00:44:36,942 --> 00:44:38,176
At first, well,

734
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:39,410
I want to try and get the--

735
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:41,312
I want to try and get
the phenomena first.

736
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,513
Then we'll try to debunk, okay?

737
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:43,882
-Okay.
-Alright, because

738
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:45,984
this just happened,
so if they could do it again,

739
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,819
let's see if it can.

740
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:50,155
If you're here, I did say--

741
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,957
When I was in here,
I have it on video,

742
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,491
when I was in here, I said,

743
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,994
if you're in here can you please
make something move?

744
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,864
So just as that happened,
my camera died.

745
00:44:59,464 --> 00:45:01,232
-And it started moving?
-It started moving.

746
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:02,667
That's freaky.

747
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,669
-What happened?
-My camera's dead.

748
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:07,172
Here I have
another one for you.

749
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:11,009
That's crazy.
I saw that rocking chair moving.

750
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,945
-I put my camera on it too.
-I caught a little bit of it.

751
00:45:13,979 --> 00:45:16,982
I didn't capture it initiating

752
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:19,517
is the issue.
No one's going to believe it.

753
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,386
I thought it was an
optical illusion at first

754
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:23,755
because of the way
that the rails are.

755
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:25,056
Yeah.

756
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:28,960
Why didn't we give Bill
the other AH33 or the 53?

757
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:30,528
-I know.
-Why?

758
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,897
Hook him up
with it right now.

759
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,332
It's downstairs, I don't think
it has battery in it too.

760
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:36,267
Alright, I'll grab it.

761
00:45:46,644 --> 00:45:48,613
-We're here.
-Joe?

762
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:50,748
Joe?

763
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:52,784
-Joe?
-Joe?

764
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:53,952
Joe?

765
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:55,386
Oh, God.

766
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:58,589
It's the exact kind of sound
when you said Joe earlier.

767
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:02,060
Every place with donations,
Crystal-T...

768
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,862
This is on too.

769
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:05,196
..keeping it ultra real.

770
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,033
-Guys! Guys!
-What? What?

771
00:46:08,066 --> 00:46:09,600
-We have it. We have it.
-Hold. Hold up.

772
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:11,602
-Hold up. Hold up.
-Look.

773
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:14,705
-Oh, yeah!
-Yes, we have it.

774
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:17,108
That's right.
We have cameras all over.

775
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:18,609
What time is it?

776
00:46:19,044 --> 00:46:21,212
Yo Bill. I'll check this too,
just in case.

777
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:22,580
Yeah, check time. Check time.

778
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,282
-Surely that's wide enough.
-It's 2:22.

779
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:26,117
So I'll say around
10:00 o'clock.

780
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:30,989
At 10:12 p.m.,

781
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:33,591
the Heinzen family's DVR system

782
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,162
captured the rocking chair
move on its own.

783
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,410
Before we reviewed the footage,

784
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:54,412
we tried every method
we could think of

785
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:57,148
to debunk the chair
moving on its own.

786
00:46:57,182 --> 00:47:00,785
We stomped on the ground near
the chair and it didn't budge.

787
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:03,821
Okay, jump around. Jump around.

788
00:47:05,891 --> 00:47:08,459
Okay. Yes, it was moving.
It was fucking moving.

789
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:11,129
-I caught a little bit.
-Hold on. I got it. I got it.

790
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,397
I caught a little bit of it.

791
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:13,899
The boards don't go
all the way through there.

792
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:15,466
Okay, back up, guys.
Let's just back up.

793
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,701
-I gotta try.
-Give us some space.

794
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:17,869
Give us some space for a bit.

795
00:47:17,903 --> 00:47:19,437
We'll try and debunk after this.

796
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:21,339
At first, well,

797
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:22,573
I want to try and get the--

798
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:24,175
I want to try and get
the phenomena first

799
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:25,610
and then we'll try
to debunk, okay?

800
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:26,844
-Okay.
-Alright, because

801
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:29,114
this just happened so
if it could do it again,

802
00:47:29,147 --> 00:47:30,548
let's see if it can.

803
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:31,682
This should not have moved.

804
00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:33,384
Now I wanna do
the debunking process.

805
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:36,087
I was trying to get it to do it
again right off the bat, right?

806
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:37,755
That's why I didn't
want to do it then.

807
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,358
But now let's try and do a
debunk-- Another debunk process.

808
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:41,826
-So here--
-Step around, guys.

809
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,762
Billy was where you are
and we were over here, so yeah.

810
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:48,733
-Nothing. It's not even moving.
-Let's just stomp.

811
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,702
-But we weren't doing that.
-Yeah, we weren't.

812
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:54,072
I'm just trying
to over dramatize it

813
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:56,774
because then it shows
even more that it's not us.

814
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:59,577
-And that's crazy.
-It's not moving at all.

815
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:00,845
No, it's not.

816
00:48:01,913 --> 00:48:05,550
So this moved by itself,
we captured it.

817
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:10,321
We then recreated
a door vacuum

818
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:13,224
and that also did not
make it budge.

819
00:48:13,758 --> 00:48:15,526
Seriously said,
"Can you move something?"

820
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,894
Actually, hold on, hold on.

821
00:48:16,928 --> 00:48:19,864
I think I might know how
to debunk us. Open that door.

822
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,632
Close it, open it.

823
00:48:23,368 --> 00:48:25,370
Suction effect.

824
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,239
Okay, now open it
how you did before.

825
00:48:30,675 --> 00:48:31,876
Opened it big too.

826
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,512
-So if there's any--
-That's not doing it.

827
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:39,317
After reviewing
the footage,

828
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,586
we know exactly
where Bill stepped

829
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:43,221
when the chair moved.

830
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,526
As you can see,
he steps in between

831
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,695
the fourth and fifth
wooden plank,

832
00:48:50,728 --> 00:48:53,198
right when
the rocking chair initiates.

833
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:04,642
Which is about a foot
away from the chair.

834
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:23,794
We also checked if this cord

835
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:26,964
had been wrapped around
the chair prior to it moving.

836
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:28,199
Upon review of the video,

837
00:49:28,233 --> 00:49:31,802
eight minutes
before the chair moved,

838
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:34,505
the cord was in the same spot,

839
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:36,507
not touching the rocking chair.

840
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:43,481
When we headed downstairs,
our walkie talkies

841
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:46,417
had an electrical interference.

842
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:54,859
Woah!

843
00:49:57,795 --> 00:49:59,197
You guys pressed the button?

844
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:03,434
You guys pressed any--

845
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:08,773
Guys, are you pressing this?

846
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:14,412
Guys? Guys, are you doing this?

847
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,685
Camera's on.

848
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:23,821
When I walked into this room,
it started doing this.

849
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,989
-Really?
-Yeah.

850
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,291
And you were recording
the whole time?

851
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:27,558
Yeah, the whole time
I was recording.

852
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:29,160
-It just went on.
-Somebody hold. Somebody hold.

853
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:30,695
-This is weird.
-Here.

854
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:34,299
Oh, now this is weird.

855
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:36,334
It's when you cross over
the threshold.

856
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:43,908
-What the heck?
-What?

857
00:50:48,313 --> 00:50:49,880
-Dude!
-That's weird.

858
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:55,720
Wait, turn back like that.
Turn back like that.

859
00:50:57,688 --> 00:50:58,956
Right there. Stay right there.

860
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,625
-Bill, can you say hello?
-Can you speak to me?

861
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:02,026
-Yeah.
-Yep.

862
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:05,563
I'll turn this one off
because...

863
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:06,864
That one's not doing it.

864
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,998
Power on.

865
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:09,767
It's only mine.

866
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,405
And the other one's upstairs.
We both left it upstairs.

867
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:18,008
-It's literally only yours, yo.
-That's weird.

868
00:51:18,843 --> 00:51:20,311
Oh, my God. Whoa!

869
00:51:25,216 --> 00:51:26,484
Why are you doing this?

870
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:28,153
This kind of reminds me
of Cosmopolitan.

871
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:30,087
Something like this happened
to me in Cosmopolitan.

872
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:33,090
Similar, but not like this.
This is more direct.

873
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:40,798
That's so crazy. Look, as soon
as he crosses that threshold.

874
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,735
-Alright, walk forward.
-Yeah, walk closer to the door.

875
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:46,404
Because that's where
originally...

876
00:51:47,738 --> 00:51:49,240
It's not. Oh, there it is.

877
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,183
What's upstairs, dude?

878
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:01,886
What if that's a--
You know, the--

879
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:05,456
Maybe look up some tech forums.

880
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,158
Yeah, see,
different walkie talkies

881
00:52:07,192 --> 00:52:08,393
do this every now and then.

882
00:52:08,426 --> 00:52:10,561
I've never seen this before.
This is really...

883
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,735
And then it stops
like entirely right there.

884
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,270
Yeah.

885
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:22,940
It's not going off at all.

886
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,112
Moving around erratically
doesn't do anything.

887
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,480
Right.

888
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:32,583
Bro, that's crazy.

889
00:52:32,617 --> 00:52:33,818
That's weird.

890
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:40,024
Ten, four, three.

891
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,429
You got it on three, alright.

892
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:45,763
Ten.

893
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:49,166
-So it's just on three.
-Only three?

894
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,968
That's three because
the one upstairs is on three.

895
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,570
This is the marking
of the Trinity too.

896
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:55,906
-Oh, my God.
-That's fucking weird.

897
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:58,843
It's only doing it on three.

898
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:02,380
Hey, now one's doing it.
It's on three?

899
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:04,249
-Yeah.
-Only on three.

900
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,585
I'm telling you
it's something more than--

901
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:08,986
It's got to be EMF.

902
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,556
Switch it to two.

903
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:13,090
Take them on two, Bill.

904
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,829
It doesn't make sense.
They should still be doing it.

905
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,197
Yeah, it's just the frequency.

906
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:22,267
Maybe it's a tower close that

907
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,135
you know,
it's picking up a signal.

908
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:28,973
And whatever's in between there
is causing an interference.

909
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:35,646
It seemed to be
a natural phenomena

910
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,250
because we could recreate it
on every walkie talkie

911
00:53:39,284 --> 00:53:41,552
while on channel three.

912
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:44,989
Another source of EMF
could be the cause.

913
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,060
While on break,

914
00:53:50,094 --> 00:53:53,398
Joe went outside to retrieve
some items from the car.

915
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:55,500
Then, as he entered the house,

916
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:58,168
he had his own experience.

917
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,572
And dude, iPhone was
actually going to have...

918
00:54:01,606 --> 00:54:03,974
-Who the fuck was in here?
-What?

919
00:54:04,008 --> 00:54:05,476
Who the fuck was in here?

920
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:07,412
What do you mean,
who the fuck was in there?

921
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:09,714
Dude, I swear to God,

922
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,582
I thought one of you guys
were in here.

923
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:13,083
-No. Why?
-Because I looked over,

924
00:54:13,117 --> 00:54:16,053
I thought-- I thought it was
you, Matt, that was in here.

925
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,455
Did you see someone in there?

926
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:19,156
Then I thought,
I looked over and see Matt,

927
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:20,991
I thought maybe
it was you, Eric.

928
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:24,061
Yeah, I saw somebody in here.

929
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:28,566
It was standing right over here.

930
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,668
Well, I'm having a deja vu
moment right now.

931
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:32,570
I thought I saw someone
standing right there.

932
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,872
You know, there's this tripod
and everything.

933
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:36,173
But it was right here.

934
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,008
Dude, I'm having a deja vu
moment right now.

935
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:39,677
It's weird
because remember you--

936
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,679
I remember you in this
situation now right now.

937
00:54:41,712 --> 00:54:43,047
Well, here, let's...

938
00:54:43,748 --> 00:54:45,850
If you're in here with this,
can you give us another sign?

939
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:47,217
Joe just saw you.

940
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:56,427
We ended our first night

941
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:59,196
with a séance
and Ouija board session.

942
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:03,100
This is when I had another
personal experience.

943
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:29,960
-Rumbling.
-It's like rumbling.

944
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:32,430
Guys, guys, I was like,
I fucking felt something weird.

945
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:34,164
I literally have
tears right now.

946
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:36,233
What happened?

947
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,841
I was...

948
00:55:47,478 --> 00:55:48,913
I don't know.

949
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,981
Well, what--
What were you feeling?

950
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:56,320
So for a second when I closed
my eyes, I just felt like

951
00:55:57,922 --> 00:56:00,157
something from above just went

952
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,861
straight through my body,
through my spine and...

953
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:09,534
I don't know
how to explain it. It was...

954
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:11,335
That sounds familiar.

955
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,170
Yeah, in my meditation I saw

956
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,739
something coming
from above the house,

957
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:17,742
into the house, go in the floor
and then it came up

958
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:20,911
out of the floor it's like six
or seven different things of--

959
00:56:20,945 --> 00:56:23,380
It's-- It was--
It was very strange.

960
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:26,050
But that same kind of experience
with it coming down

961
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:28,085
into the building.

962
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,955
It was just like white energy,

963
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:33,691
it was like a white string
energy, it was massive at first.

964
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:36,561
Yeah, I felt the pulse of like--

965
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:38,128
But it came from above of me.

966
00:56:38,162 --> 00:56:40,431
It came from above
and straight into my--

967
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:42,833
Through my spine
to the ground like,

968
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:45,870
through my body,
straight to the ground.

969
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:49,840
That's weird. We've had a lot
of correlating stuff happened.

970
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:52,643
Alright, keep focusing, y'all.
Keep focusing.

971
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:56,180
Joe and Eric

972
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:59,684
are the only ones that
knew of Jason's warning.

973
00:56:59,717 --> 00:57:02,720
I had no prior knowledge
and seemed to be

974
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:06,290
the only one affected
at this location.

975
00:57:06,323 --> 00:57:09,594
It is very rare
for this to happen to me.

976
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:29,379
In the morning of our second day
at the Farmhouse,

977
00:57:29,413 --> 00:57:32,316
I talked to Cory about
reviewing the footage

978
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:34,251
from the DVR cameras.

979
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:37,888
So last night we did
capture some interesting things.

980
00:57:37,922 --> 00:57:40,057
So the two biggest moments

981
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,392
would be the rocking chair
moving by itself.

982
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:46,163
We even tried to debunk that
and we have it on DVR

983
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:48,132
because you have a camera
pointing straight at it

984
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,368
and we want to review that
with you, if that's possible.

985
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:52,603
Oh, of course. Yeah.

986
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:54,939
And then
another thing is that

987
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,908
Joe said he saw an
apparition right here

988
00:57:57,942 --> 00:58:00,144
and you have a DVR
pointing this direction.

989
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,548
So we want to review that.
We have the times marked down

990
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:06,917
around that time period,
so that we could easily find it.

991
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,452
Easy enough.

992
00:58:09,587 --> 00:58:12,022
-Hey, Eric.
-Yeah?

993
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:16,326
Do what?

994
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,498
What are you doing?

995
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:25,636
Okay.

996
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:29,239
-What's up?
-We reviewed the footage.

997
00:58:29,273 --> 00:58:32,176
-Okay.
-But we captured it.

998
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:33,878
We captured it, clear as day.

999
00:58:33,911 --> 00:58:35,946
-No way. No way.
-Yeah.

1000
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,948
Alright,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1001
00:58:37,982 --> 00:58:39,750
Holy crap.

1002
00:58:39,784 --> 00:58:41,318
No way.

1003
00:58:42,086 --> 00:58:43,888
Yes, that is awesome.

1004
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:48,325
So we captured it,
is what you're saying?

1005
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,794
Yes, we captured it.

1006
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:51,095
We captured it.

1007
00:58:51,629 --> 00:58:53,898
I want your guys's
reaction to this.

1008
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:55,465
Yeah, I haven't seen this yet.

1009
00:58:55,499 --> 00:58:57,067
Alright. Ready?

1010
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:58,836
-Ready.
-Yeah.

1011
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,304
Let's see.

1012
00:59:01,606 --> 00:59:04,742
Holy crap. Oh, my God.

1013
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:06,944
And so we tried to
recreate that for, like,

1014
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:08,579
30 minutes,
trying to jump around,

1015
00:59:08,613 --> 00:59:09,847
pounding on the floor.

1016
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,016
There-- There was--
That's crazy.

1017
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:13,283
A huge movement.

1018
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:16,420
-Can we see it again?
-Yeah.

1019
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:18,455
Just because
that was just so incredible.

1020
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:19,890
It was incredible.

1021
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,392
Well, you-- I mean,
I just-- I jumped back.

1022
00:59:22,426 --> 00:59:23,928
-I was like, what the heck!
-Yeah.

1023
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:25,896
I was wondering because
you said you're walking up to it

1024
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:28,332
and I didn't have any idea
of how close you were to it.

1025
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:30,968
But this is-- This is amazing.
This is fantastic.

1026
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:34,271
And watch, you're going to
see him get away from it

1027
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:35,505
when it starts.

1028
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:40,144
Oh, my God.

1029
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:43,648
Now, another thing,
though, is like

1030
00:59:44,982 --> 00:59:47,017
he didn't step on it,
he didn't step on it.

1031
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:49,219
In order for him
to step on it like

1032
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,855
he would have to
be at an awkward angle.

1033
00:59:50,888 --> 00:59:52,289
-Yeah.
-You know, like to reach out

1034
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:53,724
-and step with his foot.
-Yeah.

1035
00:59:53,758 --> 00:59:55,359
-So if anybody thinks that.
-I'd have my leg stretched

1036
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:57,294
-in front of me and--
-He'd have to been way closer.

1037
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:58,629
And it starts rocking before

1038
00:59:58,663 --> 01:00:00,097
he's even halfway
through this board.

1039
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,365
And then he takes,
like, another step

1040
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:02,967
after it's already
started dropping.

1041
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,835
Yeah, because
I didn't notice it, yeah.

1042
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:07,437
I mean, that's--
My first reaction was

1043
01:00:07,471 --> 01:00:11,709
I thought it was the lighting
from everybody's cameras.

1044
01:00:11,742 --> 01:00:13,110
You know, and I thought
that a shadow

1045
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:14,879
was moving on the wall
from the lighting,

1046
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:17,514
-but it was the actual rocking.
-It was the chair.

1047
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:19,249
You see that clear
as day on camera.

1048
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:22,687
We just caught an amazing
piece of evidence right here.

1049
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:27,224
Upon trying to review
the footage

1050
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:30,360
of the possible shadow
figure seen by Joe,

1051
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:34,098
we found that the camera
had unexplainably stopped

1052
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:35,532
during the night.

1053
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:37,567
Wait a second.
What's going on here?

1054
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:39,336
Oh, is there no footage here?

1055
01:00:41,538 --> 01:00:43,808
Look at the time code,
is it fast forwarding?

1056
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:45,142
Yeah.

1057
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,211
That's weird.

1058
01:00:57,521 --> 01:00:58,689
Blocked camera?

1059
01:00:58,723 --> 01:00:59,957
That's what I'm saying.

1060
01:01:02,827 --> 01:01:03,794
Holy crap.

1061
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:08,398
You're on 17 right now.

1062
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:14,604
But if you just press the play
button, see what happens.

1063
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:17,074
That's what he did initially
and it started fast forwarding.

1064
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:18,909
-Like, see?
-What the hell?

1065
01:01:18,943 --> 01:01:20,711
Look at that,
it's jumping wildly.

1066
01:01:20,745 --> 01:01:23,147
Oh, come on, no way.

1067
01:01:23,914 --> 01:01:26,050
-Man!
-What the hell?

1068
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:29,419
Okay, where we are
right now? Okay. Okay.

1069
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:32,923
It shows movement,
though, right?

1070
01:01:32,957 --> 01:01:34,424
Those are the green spots.

1071
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:37,527
Yeah, it should be but it
should be playing at this point

1072
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:40,798
because you're right--
Right here at 1300.

1073
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:43,300
Now 15, 16, 17, 18.

1074
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:47,204
-So we're all okay now.
-It's jumping. It's jumping.

1075
01:01:47,604 --> 01:01:49,740
And then around there's
when it was captured.

1076
01:01:49,774 --> 01:01:51,575
Oh, ain't that
fucking convenient?

1077
01:01:53,277 --> 01:01:55,780
-What the hell?
-The fuck? Are you shitting me?

1078
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:02,552
While we were outside
filming B-roll,

1079
01:02:02,586 --> 01:02:06,390
I went back inside to grab
my camera and jacket.

1080
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:10,094
And while I came back, Eric
told me something interesting.

1081
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,198
We're outside,
about to do some drone shots,

1082
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:16,767
and I thought Matt had came out

1083
01:02:16,801 --> 01:02:18,702
in his T-shirt
and then went back in,

1084
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,037
to, I guess, get
a jacket or something.

1085
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,738
He said he hadn't
come out at all, right?

1086
01:02:21,772 --> 01:02:23,974
No, I-- The only time
I came out was when

1087
01:02:24,008 --> 01:02:25,910
I just-- You just
now saw me come out.

1088
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:27,611
I was actually looking
for this camera.

1089
01:02:27,644 --> 01:02:29,780
I saw him 100%
come around that corner.

1090
01:02:29,814 --> 01:02:32,316
It was him to a tee,
his shirt, his hat, everything.

1091
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:34,051
It was 100% you.

1092
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:35,319
-Yeah.
-Dude, that's crazy.

1093
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:37,187
I saw a doppelganger
of Matt here.

1094
01:02:37,221 --> 01:02:38,455
That's weird.

1095
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:46,263
Could it have been
my doppelganger Eric saw?

1096
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:50,467
This is only one of many
encounters we have had

1097
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,003
of possible mimicking.

1098
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:56,473
I don't know, where--

1099
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:57,975
So you heard it while
you're in the bathroom

1100
01:02:58,008 --> 01:02:59,443
or when you were coming out.

1101
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:01,711
I was still in the bathroom,
I was getting ready to come out.

1102
01:03:01,745 --> 01:03:04,681
And I heard
a little girl say, "Daddy."

1103
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:06,817
Did it come from, like
in the bathroom or out here.

1104
01:03:06,851 --> 01:03:08,218
What do you think?

1105
01:03:08,252 --> 01:03:10,120
No, it definitely
came from out here.

1106
01:03:10,154 --> 01:03:11,956
-Got you.
-So, I don't know.

1107
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:15,359
It's just weird stuff like that.
It's bizarre.

1108
01:03:15,392 --> 01:03:17,227
Well, I was going
to say that daddy thing,

1109
01:03:17,261 --> 01:03:18,963
I guarantee you,
that's not a little girl

1110
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:20,130
calling out for her daddy.

1111
01:03:20,164 --> 01:03:21,565
That is so like--

1112
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:23,901
Yeah, that's so-- It's too
typical. You know what I mean?

1113
01:03:23,934 --> 01:03:26,803
That's too, like that is--
That is definitely something

1114
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:28,072
like mimicking or something.

1115
01:03:28,105 --> 01:03:29,874
Right.
Check this out, though.

1116
01:03:29,907 --> 01:03:33,077
So Bill had his daughter
on the phone,

1117
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,378
remember, on his speaker phone?

1118
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:35,545
That's right.

1119
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:37,081
Maybe that helped
trigger something.

1120
01:03:37,114 --> 01:03:38,282
Maybe.

1121
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:39,649
Also, what I found
interesting is

1122
01:03:39,683 --> 01:03:40,885
when you mentioned
the mimicking thing,

1123
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:42,819
remember what you saw earlier,

1124
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,155
of me; seeing me

1125
01:03:45,189 --> 01:03:46,823
-in my t-shirt.
-That's right. Hold on.

1126
01:03:46,857 --> 01:03:48,125
So that's a good point.

1127
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,860
I saw him walk around
the corner of the house

1128
01:03:49,894 --> 01:03:51,828
when we were getting ready
to do a drone shot.

1129
01:03:51,862 --> 01:03:53,430
I saw him walk out
in his t-shirt

1130
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:54,764
and then he walked back

1131
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:56,700
and then he came back
out with the jacket.

1132
01:03:56,733 --> 01:03:58,102
And I was like, "Did you walk,

1133
01:03:58,135 --> 01:03:59,503
you know,
walk out and then walk back?"

1134
01:03:59,536 --> 01:04:01,471
And he said, "No, not at all."
It was him.

1135
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:04,141
I saw him exactly
but there was no one there.

1136
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:05,642
I saw the doppelganger of Matt

1137
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,211
walk on the side
of this building.

1138
01:04:07,244 --> 01:04:08,378
Well, see,

1139
01:04:08,412 --> 01:04:10,080
well, that was last night
when I come in.

1140
01:04:10,114 --> 01:04:11,882
I thought Matt was in there.

1141
01:04:11,916 --> 01:04:13,650
Oh, yeah.
That was your initial thought

1142
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,219
-is you thought it was Matt.
-Right.

1143
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:19,123
And I looked in here and at
first I only seen you and Billy,

1144
01:04:19,156 --> 01:04:21,658
so I thought Matt was in there
and I looked in there again.

1145
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:22,993
I didn't see anybody.

1146
01:04:23,027 --> 01:04:24,761
And then when I turned
to look again,

1147
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:26,263
-there was Matt.
-There he was.

1148
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:28,098
I'm like, "Whoa, wait a minute."

1149
01:04:28,132 --> 01:04:29,866
And then damn camera.

1150
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,902
Yeah, the camera,
right after that,

1151
01:04:31,936 --> 01:04:34,638
completely no-- No footage
at all on camera five.

1152
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:36,040
All the rest of
the cameras recorded

1153
01:04:36,073 --> 01:04:37,641
just fine throughout
the entire night,

1154
01:04:37,674 --> 01:04:38,909
the entire investigation,

1155
01:04:38,943 --> 01:04:40,877
camera five, for some reason,

1156
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:42,679
doesn't have any footage on it.

1157
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,814
That's just strange.
That's just strange.

1158
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:47,952
What we know now
is that this thing is mimicking.

1159
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:49,453
Yeah.

1160
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:51,621
Completely mimicking
in multiple different ways.

1161
01:04:51,655 --> 01:04:53,423
And that's very strange
and we all know that

1162
01:04:53,457 --> 01:04:55,692
what that possibly
leads to so...

1163
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:01,631
Before we arrived at
the Harrisville Farmhouse,

1164
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:04,701
Eric conducted
a tarot card reading

1165
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,271
and now he is revealing
their meaning.

1166
01:05:07,304 --> 01:05:09,706
Some of what he mentions
foreshadows

1167
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:11,675
what is to come.

1168
01:05:11,976 --> 01:05:14,411
The card visible
at the center of the cross

1169
01:05:14,444 --> 01:05:17,181
represents the obstacle
that stands in your way,

1170
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:20,184
it may even be something
that sounds good

1171
01:05:20,217 --> 01:05:22,452
but is not actually good
to your benefit.

1172
01:05:22,486 --> 01:05:25,755
Strength, courage,
fortitude, conviction,

1173
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:27,958
energy, determination,
defiance, action,

1174
01:05:27,992 --> 01:05:30,327
awareness of temptation
and the mental

1175
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,329
and physical abilities
to overcome them.

1176
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:35,532
Hidden forces at work
are challenged.

1177
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:40,337
Heroism, virility, strength
to endure in spite of obstacles.

1178
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,540
We got the seven
of cups reversed.

1179
01:05:44,308 --> 01:05:46,643
-There's that number.
-Yeah, and it's also reversed.

1180
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:48,778
Which means desire,
determination,

1181
01:05:48,812 --> 01:05:51,281
strong willpower,
a goal attained,

1182
01:05:51,315 --> 01:05:54,718
intelligent choice,
desire, will, resolution

1183
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:56,486
The card at the right
of the cross represents

1184
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,323
an approaching influence
or something to be embraced.

1185
01:05:59,356 --> 01:06:01,525
Alright, here's the capability
of perceiving

1186
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:03,393
temptation and avoiding evil.

1187
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,363
So again, that's good.
Now, here's the last one.

1188
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:10,600
The card at the top of the staff
represents the ultimate outcome

1189
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,869
should you continue
on this course.

1190
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:15,739
We got the Knight
of Cups reversed.

1191
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:19,743
Subtlety, artifice, trickery,
deception, fraud,

1192
01:06:19,776 --> 01:06:24,281
a sly and cunning person,
a person capable of swindling.

1193
01:06:25,782 --> 01:06:28,218
So basically
this thing's thinking

1194
01:06:28,252 --> 01:06:30,620
this is going to be a battle,

1195
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:32,289
an absolute battle,

1196
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:34,424
and it's going to be
battles of despair,

1197
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:36,026
battles of hidden forces,

1198
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:37,894
battles of evil and good

1199
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:40,030
in this house with the spirits
and with us.

1200
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:50,540
And then he talked about Matt.

1201
01:06:51,408 --> 01:06:53,510
This is leading up
to what you and I know

1202
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:56,680
about the message from Emerick.

1203
01:06:57,747 --> 01:06:59,649
Oh, yeah. Do you want
me to talk about that now?

1204
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:02,719
Yeah, talk about that now and
then I'll go ahead and reveal.

1205
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:04,954
Okay. We're talking about
the Jason Emerick thing.

1206
01:07:04,988 --> 01:07:07,157
Okay, listen, Billy and I
don't know anything about it.

1207
01:07:07,191 --> 01:07:09,025
So this is new.

1208
01:07:09,593 --> 01:07:12,996
"Seven will be there.
Matt needs to be careful.

1209
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:16,700
I don't know what to say really

1210
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:18,635
to what was coming through.

1211
01:07:19,336 --> 01:07:22,906
I know they're all going
to be all over his energy.

1212
01:07:24,408 --> 01:07:27,010
They said his name
more than once,

1213
01:07:27,677 --> 01:07:30,046
within minutes. Sounds.

1214
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:36,153
Or within minutes, seconds.

1215
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,455
The door is open."

1216
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:52,302
Everything he said came true.

1217
01:07:52,336 --> 01:07:55,805
Now he said inside the mirror,

1218
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:58,742
the Black Mirror Ouija board.

1219
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:03,580
"Please tell Matt to
please take extra precaution."

1220
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:12,889
About an hour after being
informed about Jason's warning,

1221
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,759
we started gearing up
for our 30 minute

1222
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:18,262
individual isolation experiment.

1223
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:20,264
So right now we're about
to do our solo sessions,

1224
01:08:20,297 --> 01:08:21,731
and this is going
to be your setup.

1225
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:23,400
It's a very similar setup to

1226
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,369
what I use for
Man Versus Paranormal.

1227
01:08:25,402 --> 01:08:26,903
So you got everything you need.

1228
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,005
It's a 4K night vision camera.

1229
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:31,608
A good audio Zoom H4M pro.

1230
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:33,843
Dead light, the best
IR light in the business.

1231
01:08:33,877 --> 01:08:36,112
And then we have a face cam

1232
01:08:36,146 --> 01:08:38,182
for your reactions because
we want those reactions

1233
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:40,517
also it's good for EVPs

1234
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,686
if we can-- So you know
that he's not

1235
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,254
whispering
or something like that

1236
01:08:44,288 --> 01:08:46,122
he's in the building by himself.

1237
01:08:46,156 --> 01:08:49,058
So if there's any voice
and it shows him not whispering,

1238
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:50,560
that's going to be interesting.

1239
01:08:50,594 --> 01:08:52,396
And especially for
disembodied voices,

1240
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:53,997
this will capture
the disembodied voices

1241
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:56,032
because of how
clear this audio is.

1242
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:57,501
So here it is.

1243
01:08:57,534 --> 01:09:00,604
This is going to
be our solo setup

1244
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:04,241
and it works really well for me
for Man Versus Paranormal so...

1245
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:07,344
This is a beast,
this a frigging beast, dude.

1246
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:08,578
This is awesome.

1247
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:10,814
They call you Matt Tactical
for a reason.

1248
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:32,869
Oh, my goodness.
There is something up here.

1249
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:34,638
Like one hundo.

1250
01:09:37,274 --> 01:09:39,175
Like, no joke. Like one hundo.

1251
01:09:40,043 --> 01:09:41,811
Eric says
there's someone up there.

1252
01:09:42,312 --> 01:09:43,413
Hello?

1253
01:09:45,081 --> 01:09:47,183
Alright, I got to bust out
some equipment here

1254
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:49,118
because I know you're here.

1255
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:54,958
There was just a noise
in the corner, I think.

1256
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:01,130
Look, if you're familiar
with me and the equipment,

1257
01:10:01,164 --> 01:10:04,534
will you make a noise in here?
So that way I know--

1258
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:07,304
So that way I know.

1259
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:14,778
I'm going to-- I'm going to walk
into the center room here.

1260
01:10:16,246 --> 01:10:19,148
Everything,
every fibre of my being

1261
01:10:19,182 --> 01:10:21,351
is telling me
to turn on the flash light.

1262
01:10:23,587 --> 01:10:25,655
So is someone over here?

1263
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:32,262
If so, can you please
say something?

1264
01:10:38,302 --> 01:10:40,604
Here, I'm going to bust out
a recorder

1265
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,439
that you haven't seen yet.

1266
01:10:43,307 --> 01:10:45,375
It's called the Sony Saint.

1267
01:10:45,709 --> 01:10:47,877
It's the Sony ST25.

1268
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:52,516
I'm hitting record,
so when I hit record,

1269
01:10:52,549 --> 01:10:54,183
you can talk and I'll hear you.

1270
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:08,131
William, are you here?

1271
01:11:19,175 --> 01:11:20,877
What was that?

1272
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:22,245
Fellas, are you all talking?

1273
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,314
Did Joe just say
something real loud?

1274
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:27,317
None of us said anything.

1275
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:29,819
No one said anything?

1276
01:11:29,853 --> 01:11:31,555
No.

1277
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:35,291
Okay. I got to get
into this other room.

1278
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:37,260
Oh, my God.

1279
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,228
That voice was clear as day.

1280
01:11:41,431 --> 01:11:43,433
It sounded like Joe talking.

1281
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,370
It was that type of voice.

1282
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,739
I swear, that sounded
like Joe talking.

1283
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,676
That's crazy.

1284
01:11:52,709 --> 01:11:54,277
I only hit play
on the Sony Saint.

1285
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,845
Remember the mimicking.

1286
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,915
Oh, that's right. The mimicking.

1287
01:11:58,948 --> 01:12:01,217
Oh, my God, I forgot about that.

1288
01:12:05,455 --> 01:12:07,891
Holy crap.
And it sounded just like Joe.

1289
01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:09,826
Oh, man.

1290
01:12:12,862 --> 01:12:13,930
Ooh!

1291
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:18,435
Well, I'm going to listen back
because I think I was recording

1292
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:19,836
when it happened.

1293
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:21,771
William, are you here?

1294
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:26,510
William, are you here?

1295
01:12:27,411 --> 01:12:30,447
Hey, wait, I'm going
to turn the compressor on.

1296
01:12:45,629 --> 01:12:47,464
Whoa, I think that was it.

1297
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,669
I caught it. I caught it.

1298
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,438
I caught it on the Sony Saint.

1299
01:12:54,471 --> 01:12:55,905
Are you there?

1300
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,510
Right there.

1301
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:02,045
William, are you here?

1302
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:17,761
What was that?

1303
01:13:17,794 --> 01:13:19,729
Fellas, are you all talking?

1304
01:13:19,763 --> 01:13:22,599
Did Joe just say
something real loud?

1305
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:27,671
I'm going to set this down
for a second.

1306
01:13:28,872 --> 01:13:31,374
Fellas, what's my time like,
am I at 15 minutes?

1307
01:13:35,044 --> 01:13:36,980
16 minutes and 48 seconds.

1308
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:39,516
Got you. Alright, it's time
to go downstairs.

1309
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:42,619
Alright, let's get resituated.

1310
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:48,357
Oh, goodness gracious.

1311
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:51,260
The door's like
partially cracked open.

1312
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:02,138
Oh, the cellar, if you will.

1313
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:05,041
That was me.

1314
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:09,846
Are you kidding?

1315
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:12,649
I just felt a gust of wind
from my right side.

1316
01:14:28,765 --> 01:14:30,299
Here we go.

1317
01:14:31,434 --> 01:14:34,003
Oh, that's a big
first step, jeez!

1318
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:39,909
The gateway is radio silence.

1319
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,816
You know what? If the gateway's
going to be silent...

1320
01:14:48,117 --> 01:14:49,853
Well, here, I'll switch to AM

1321
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,689
at some point.

1322
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:54,357
Not right now.

1323
01:15:00,363 --> 01:15:02,699
Alright, first steps
in the basement.

1324
01:15:06,936 --> 01:15:08,404
Oh, no.

1325
01:15:15,044 --> 01:15:16,746
Is there anyone down here?

1326
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:27,190
Spirits, can you tell me,
is there anything down here?

1327
01:15:40,904 --> 01:15:42,572
There's something
walking around.

1328
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:50,747
Man, I'm feeling stuff all over
me, on my head and my hand.

1329
01:15:55,585 --> 01:15:57,220
Who's there?

1330
01:16:12,335 --> 01:16:13,937
I have to go
upstairs after this.

1331
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:15,104
But this is Eric from Epic.

1332
01:16:15,138 --> 01:16:17,040
What do you want
to tell us for tonight?

1333
01:16:20,844 --> 01:16:22,545
Oh, goodness.

1334
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,214
That fricking heat or something
just turned on.

1335
01:16:25,715 --> 01:16:27,684
Okay, time is up.

1336
01:16:27,717 --> 01:16:29,018
Time is up.

1337
01:16:30,687 --> 01:16:32,288
Alright, hitting stop.

1338
01:16:35,491 --> 01:16:38,461
Try the different buttons.
It's up to you. Good luck.

1339
01:16:38,494 --> 01:16:40,630
Thanks. Let's do this.

1340
01:16:40,897 --> 01:16:42,498
You got this, man.
You've got this.

1341
01:16:58,047 --> 01:17:02,418
So Matt's style is kind of
in between all of ours.

1342
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:04,253
Well,

1343
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:09,325
Matt's far more scientific

1344
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:12,261
but I can tell, I mean, he's
getting open to more things.

1345
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:14,530
He's been real open
on this journey.

1346
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:24,173
Talking about goosebumps, huh?
Yeah, I know the feeling.

1347
01:17:29,545 --> 01:17:30,646
Okay.

1348
01:17:31,414 --> 01:17:32,849
Just you and I right now.

1349
01:17:36,552 --> 01:17:39,689
I'm really feeling you,
so you better do something good.

1350
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:42,225
Well, I feel you all over.

1351
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:45,094
Okay.

1352
01:17:45,962 --> 01:17:47,831
If there's an entity here,

1353
01:17:48,865 --> 01:17:50,333
let's get you going here.

1354
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:52,869
Let's actually
have a conversation

1355
01:17:52,902 --> 01:17:56,940
and let's make something happen.

1356
01:18:06,082 --> 01:18:08,985
That's me sighing.

1357
01:18:10,486 --> 01:18:11,821
Okay. Come on.

1358
01:18:13,923 --> 01:18:15,558
Where are you hiding at, huh?

1359
01:18:15,591 --> 01:18:16,826
If you're a demon,

1360
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,063
if you're just
calling yourself a demon.

1361
01:18:20,096 --> 01:18:22,832
You're not showing your strength

1362
01:18:23,099 --> 01:18:24,768
your so-called strength.

1363
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:29,605
You affected a family,

1364
01:18:29,638 --> 01:18:32,308
a whole family terrified of you.

1365
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:35,845
But you can't do
a single thing to terrify me.

1366
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:43,486
If you want to really

1367
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:46,990
scare me?

1368
01:18:47,924 --> 01:18:50,259
Physically hurt me. Physically.

1369
01:18:50,293 --> 01:18:52,128
-Jeez.
-I give you permission.

1370
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:58,567
The paranormal drives
every fiber of my being.

1371
01:18:58,601 --> 01:19:00,669
I am riveted by it.

1372
01:19:00,703 --> 01:19:04,974
When I invite an entity to
physically hurt me, I mean it,

1373
01:19:05,008 --> 01:19:06,876
especially if it helps

1374
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:09,178
paranormal phenomena
to manifest.

1375
01:19:09,212 --> 01:19:10,947
I give you permission.

1376
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:24,593
I heard you lift beds,

1377
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:26,195
move beds.

1378
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:29,498
I hear you attacking people.

1379
01:19:30,733 --> 01:19:32,235
What a...

1380
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:34,938
I'm standing here offering it.

1381
01:19:34,971 --> 01:19:36,739
Literally, an offering.

1382
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:42,245
All this talk

1383
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:47,450
and affecting

1384
01:19:48,184 --> 01:19:50,119
a family so horribly

1385
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,689
and then when
someone stands up to you,

1386
01:19:54,257 --> 01:19:55,291
you back off.

1387
01:19:58,962 --> 01:20:00,196
Well, most people would say,

1388
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:02,331
this is stupid
what I'm doing right now,

1389
01:20:02,365 --> 01:20:04,767
but I'm really here
for evidence.

1390
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,703
I'm an investigator
and I want evidence, okay?

1391
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:11,574
And that's why I made
an offering right now.

1392
01:20:12,008 --> 01:20:13,642
I'm giving you that offering.

1393
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,948
You got 16 minutes.

1394
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:23,786
16 minutes.

1395
01:20:24,787 --> 01:20:26,022
Okay.

1396
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:32,929
After our isolations,
we split up into two groups.

1397
01:20:32,962 --> 01:20:36,632
Eric and I did another séance
session on the second floor

1398
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:40,436
because of what I experienced
in our first séance.

1399
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:43,406
Meanwhile, Joe and Billy
were in the basement

1400
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:45,474
conducting EVP sessions.

1401
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:47,176
-Now, I've started, okay.
-Rolling? Alright.

1402
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:48,577
We're about to head upstairs.

1403
01:20:48,611 --> 01:20:50,779
Matt and me are going to do
a little séance action.

1404
01:20:50,813 --> 01:20:52,781
Me and him had some good
results with it last night.

1405
01:20:52,815 --> 01:20:54,350
Now it's going to be
just him and me.

1406
01:20:54,383 --> 01:20:56,419
We're going to focus
for however long it takes

1407
01:20:56,452 --> 01:20:57,620
because we know
something's up there.

1408
01:20:57,653 --> 01:20:58,754
We know they're trying
to come through.

1409
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:00,723
-You ready for this?
-Yes, I am.

1410
01:21:00,756 --> 01:21:02,291
-Me too. I'm excited.
-I'm ready.

1411
01:21:02,325 --> 01:21:03,792
I like this kind of thing
because like--

1412
01:21:03,826 --> 01:21:05,594
Like you're saying,
like we feel it.

1413
01:21:05,628 --> 01:21:07,430
Like, I really-- I was
really feeling it last night.

1414
01:21:07,463 --> 01:21:09,732
-It was building up.
-Yeah.

1415
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:15,004
Judging from
the experiences we had,

1416
01:21:15,038 --> 01:21:18,707
Eric and I were in the most
active part of the house,

1417
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:21,444
so I decided to do
something different

1418
01:21:21,477 --> 01:21:24,880
and completely open myself up
to the entity there.

1419
01:21:24,914 --> 01:21:27,583
I wanted no barriers between me

1420
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:30,086
and whatever is in the house,

1421
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:33,089
hoping the house
would speak to me.

1422
01:21:33,122 --> 01:21:36,492
I'm letting it affect me
in any way it likes.

1423
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:38,761
This is something
I don't usually do,

1424
01:21:38,794 --> 01:21:42,198
but Jason's warning
made me want to.

1425
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:45,268
Alright,
so we're focusing on you.

1426
01:21:45,501 --> 01:21:47,436
We're focusing our energy,

1427
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:49,605
our passion,
our drive, our desires

1428
01:21:50,273 --> 01:21:53,042
and our will to communicate,
we're focusing it all on you

1429
01:21:53,276 --> 01:21:55,244
so that we can come
through and talk to us.

1430
01:22:04,954 --> 01:22:07,356
-I didn't hear anything.
-I did not.

1431
01:22:10,994 --> 01:22:13,296
We have the rem pod here,
if you touch that.

1432
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:16,265
I know that you're here.

1433
01:22:28,044 --> 01:22:29,412
What do you think of Matt?

1434
01:22:29,845 --> 01:22:33,449
If you're here,
don't be afraid to reach out.

1435
01:22:33,482 --> 01:22:35,151
I know Matt was intense earlier,

1436
01:22:35,184 --> 01:22:37,520
but he was just trying
to look out for you.

1437
01:22:37,853 --> 01:22:40,223
I was just trying
to protect people

1438
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:42,925
from being affected again

1439
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:46,062
and stand up from what's evil.

1440
01:22:47,163 --> 01:22:48,764
All the good ones.

1441
01:22:49,365 --> 01:22:52,701
I'm completely open
and accept you.

1442
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:55,538
Dude!

1443
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:00,343
Hello. You don't have to
hide back there.

1444
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,912
-You can walk over here.
-Yeah.

1445
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:10,353
Completely open and accept you.

1446
01:23:12,088 --> 01:23:13,956
-Dude!
-Accept you.

1447
01:23:15,391 --> 01:23:16,825
Dude!

1448
01:23:19,262 --> 01:23:21,030
What do you think of me?

1449
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:34,577
What do you think of Matt?

1450
01:23:50,826 --> 01:23:52,861
I guess, I heard his name.

1451
01:24:00,203 --> 01:24:02,971
Matt. Can you hear it?

1452
01:24:03,005 --> 01:24:04,740
Yeah, I can sense it.

1453
01:24:06,809 --> 01:24:09,745
-Right there.
-Yeah, sounds like Matt.

1454
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,488
It's something. I mean,
it sounds like Matt, but--

1455
01:24:19,522 --> 01:24:20,656
It does.

1456
01:24:25,961 --> 01:24:28,897
We should probably
go chill with them.

1457
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:32,735
-Do our last push.
-Hurrah.

1458
01:24:32,768 --> 01:24:34,737
Yeah, we're going to
have to call it.

1459
01:24:36,839 --> 01:24:39,775
We're going to refocus
our energy on you.

1460
01:24:40,543 --> 01:24:42,044
On the spirits here.

1461
01:24:43,312 --> 01:24:44,813
It's me again.

1462
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:47,550
And that was Matt saying,
"It's me again."

1463
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:56,125
I keep seeing the woods
but with like a tombstone.

1464
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:58,527
I keep seeing a shadow.

1465
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:02,165
-Where at?
-I mean, in my mind.

1466
01:25:02,198 --> 01:25:04,032
-In your mind?
-Behind me.

1467
01:25:05,134 --> 01:25:07,636
Alright, let me try to look
behind you as well.

1468
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,873
Okay, alright.

1469
01:25:12,808 --> 01:25:15,711
There is 100%
something behind you.

1470
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:22,418
I tried looking at it like
meditation wise,

1471
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,220
like pastural wise,
and there was immediately

1472
01:25:24,253 --> 01:25:26,889
this gigantic, like,
dark, greyish, like

1473
01:25:27,723 --> 01:25:29,825
-just energy.
-One second.

1474
01:25:36,532 --> 01:25:39,067
I'm seeing little maggots
from the room bottom.

1475
01:25:39,101 --> 01:25:40,836
I'm seeing,
like little red dots,

1476
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:43,439
like little red specks flashing.

1477
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,474
Whoa.

1478
01:25:47,776 --> 01:25:49,978
That's them. That's them.

1479
01:25:50,012 --> 01:25:51,480
That's Bill.

1480
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,613
So you said
there's something behind Matt.

1481
01:26:57,646 --> 01:26:59,248
That there's
something else in here.

1482
01:26:59,282 --> 01:27:01,584
Can you confirm?
Are those both correct?

1483
01:27:14,797 --> 01:27:17,500
I hear those noises
are Billy downstairs moving.

1484
01:27:17,533 --> 01:27:19,335
Just for notation.

1485
01:27:23,839 --> 01:27:26,375
You know, when I was
doing the séance part,

1486
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,477
you know what I was envisioning?

1487
01:27:28,511 --> 01:27:30,313
What did you see?

1488
01:27:30,346 --> 01:27:32,180
Woah!

1489
01:27:32,214 --> 01:27:33,716
Is that what you saw?

1490
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:35,284
No, what did you see?

1491
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:40,889
I saw a shadow behind me,

1492
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:45,060
I was getting dragged into
that room back there.

1493
01:27:46,662 --> 01:27:48,497
That's freaky.
The middle room?

1494
01:27:48,531 --> 01:27:50,065
-The rocking chair
-Mm-hmm.

1495
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,472
Spirits, did you see
something similar to that?

1496
01:27:56,505 --> 01:27:57,740
Matt getting dragged
into the room?

1497
01:28:02,177 --> 01:28:03,512
Leave now.

1498
01:28:03,546 --> 01:28:05,348
-Leave now.
-Leave now.

1499
01:28:05,381 --> 01:28:07,082
-Leave now.
-Matthew.

1500
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:09,217
-Bro, we--
-Matthew.

1501
01:28:09,251 --> 01:28:10,719
That was so cool.

1502
01:28:13,456 --> 01:28:15,858
That's a "Leave Now."
It's so clear.

1503
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:18,794
Why should we leave?

1504
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:25,401
Please elaborate.

1505
01:28:26,068 --> 01:28:28,136
I feel so drawn to that area.

1506
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:32,775
Take a camera.

1507
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:35,277
Get it, whatever it is.

1508
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,279
The deal.

1509
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,582
-The deal.
-Stop.

1510
01:28:40,349 --> 01:28:42,217
The deal.

1511
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:44,487
-The deal.
-Stop.

1512
01:28:46,455 --> 01:28:47,623
Come on, hold it.

1513
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:56,365
God damn.

1514
01:29:10,879 --> 01:29:12,615
Whoa!

1515
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:21,356
Like now?

1516
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:23,091
I heard Sarah.

1517
01:29:36,171 --> 01:29:37,740
Sarah.

1518
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:49,184
Sarah.

1519
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,873
Yo, Billy.

1520
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,976
Can you come up here with us?
It's pretty lit.

1521
01:30:14,009 --> 01:30:15,310
Matt.

1522
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:16,845
-Matt?
-Matt.

1523
01:30:19,982 --> 01:30:21,817
We were doing
an EVP session down there

1524
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:23,251
-and I was asking
-Bathsheba.

1525
01:30:23,285 --> 01:30:24,820
what they thought of all of us.

1526
01:30:24,853 --> 01:30:25,988
-Bathsheba.
-I said, What do you think--"

1527
01:30:26,021 --> 01:30:27,389
Bathsheba!

1528
01:30:29,091 --> 01:30:30,926
Damn, surely that got it.

1529
01:30:31,894 --> 01:30:33,028
Had to have...

1530
01:31:14,903 --> 01:31:17,072
I can't believe
he shut the door.

1531
01:33:10,018 --> 01:33:11,519
Yo, you alright?

1532
01:33:13,789 --> 01:33:15,090
What happened?

1533
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:17,726
Did he pass out or something?

1534
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:19,862
Are you recording?

1535
01:33:35,543 --> 01:33:36,712
What's up?

1536
01:33:38,647 --> 01:33:39,882
You alright?

1537
01:33:43,351 --> 01:33:45,087
What happened, big dog?

1538
01:33:45,854 --> 01:33:47,489
I'm going to get some air.

1539
01:33:47,923 --> 01:33:49,858
-Wait.
-I'm going to get some air.

1540
01:33:50,793 --> 01:33:52,828
Okay, follow him.
Are you getting all that?

1541
01:33:53,261 --> 01:33:54,730
I got it all.

1542
01:33:55,163 --> 01:33:56,865
Yeah, I want to get
some air too.

1543
01:33:56,899 --> 01:33:59,735
He was laying on his back there
when I came through.

1544
01:34:04,106 --> 01:34:05,841
We have to watch that camera

1545
01:34:06,709 --> 01:34:09,011
because he was just
sitting in there, right?

1546
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:11,213
Yeah, sitting on the floor.

1547
01:34:11,246 --> 01:34:13,215
He was laying right
flat on his back.

1548
01:34:30,232 --> 01:34:32,300
Where did he go?

1549
01:34:36,271 --> 01:34:37,672
Oh, shit.

1550
01:34:37,706 --> 01:34:39,942
There's no freaking light
whatever the hell's this thing.

1551
01:34:45,647 --> 01:34:47,449
Where the hell did he go?

1552
01:34:47,482 --> 01:34:48,884
What a hero!

1553
01:35:07,335 --> 01:35:08,737
He's entered the cemetery?

1554
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,007
What happened to Matt?

1555
01:35:18,646 --> 01:35:20,482
Did you do something to Matt?

1556
01:35:22,818 --> 01:35:23,986
You smell that?

1557
01:35:25,754 --> 01:35:28,123
-Smells like wood burning.
-Yeah.

1558
01:35:30,392 --> 01:35:32,127
Yeah, I definitely smell that.

1559
01:35:34,629 --> 01:35:36,164
It's burning wood.

1560
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:39,601
That's strange
since we haven't smelled that

1561
01:35:39,634 --> 01:35:41,336
since we've been here.

1562
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:42,504
Right.

1563
01:35:56,785 --> 01:35:57,986
You okay?

1564
01:36:08,964 --> 01:36:10,332
They're not in here.

1565
01:36:14,903 --> 01:36:16,805
-I really don't know.
-You got the talkie?

1566
01:36:18,706 --> 01:36:20,575
Matt was lying
like a dead man up there.

1567
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:21,810
Are they in there?

1568
01:36:21,844 --> 01:36:23,578
I don't know.
Here's my walkie.

1569
01:36:26,248 --> 01:36:28,283
Where are you guys at?

1570
01:36:53,241 --> 01:36:54,742
There you are.

1571
01:36:59,014 --> 01:37:00,348
You alright?

1572
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:36,118
I was just zoned out.

1573
01:37:37,619 --> 01:37:38,987
Like...

1574
01:37:41,356 --> 01:37:43,225
I felt the terror from

1575
01:37:44,092 --> 01:37:46,995
the Perrons,
or at least one of them.

1576
01:37:47,662 --> 01:37:51,266
I think it was one of them
I was really feeling

1577
01:37:51,799 --> 01:37:53,601
and...

1578
01:37:58,373 --> 01:38:00,242
I felt, like, suffering

1579
01:38:01,109 --> 01:38:05,013
from someone else,
not me at that time and...

1580
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:10,252
I completely zoned out.

1581
01:38:10,285 --> 01:38:12,354
I was following

1582
01:38:14,822 --> 01:38:19,294
to the certain areas
of the top floor

1583
01:38:19,327 --> 01:38:24,366
and I was completely losing,

1584
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:27,135
like completely losing
my equilibrium.

1585
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:33,141
And I almost cried at one point
from feeling her emotions.

1586
01:38:35,377 --> 01:38:37,312
And that's weird
because they're alive,

1587
01:38:37,812 --> 01:38:40,282
you know, they're alive,
they're not dead or anything.

1588
01:38:40,315 --> 01:38:42,450
Yeah, but I felt like
I was feeling

1589
01:38:42,951 --> 01:38:46,721
someone-- someone from a family
that was here or something,

1590
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:48,723
which makes no sense.

1591
01:38:49,157 --> 01:38:50,825
Their emotions--
Dude that makes perfect sense.

1592
01:38:50,858 --> 01:38:52,327
Their emotions
are probably still here.

1593
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:54,296
Imagine all they
went through, you know?

1594
01:38:57,966 --> 01:38:59,934
And at one--
When we were doing that--

1595
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:01,303
We were doing that focusing

1596
01:39:01,336 --> 01:39:03,505
and then you got up
and just walked off.

1597
01:39:04,806 --> 01:39:06,508
You felt something.

1598
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:08,110
Oh, my God and that was also

1599
01:39:08,143 --> 01:39:10,078
the vision of being
dragged in there.

1600
01:39:10,112 --> 01:39:11,179
Yeah.

1601
01:39:12,547 --> 01:39:13,615
And then you go in there

1602
01:39:13,648 --> 01:39:15,283
and then you get dragged
into a trance.

1603
01:39:15,317 --> 01:39:16,551
You get dragged deep

1604
01:39:16,584 --> 01:39:18,086
-into those emotions.
-I was so in a trance.

1605
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:19,654
I have never had that
in my whole life.

1606
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:22,157
I have never had that ever

1607
01:39:22,190 --> 01:39:24,259
in my whole entire life

1608
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:27,062
felt that way in a location.

1609
01:39:30,032 --> 01:39:31,966
It took you deep
into that emotion.

1610
01:39:35,603 --> 01:39:37,139
That's wild, dude.

1611
01:39:37,172 --> 01:39:39,007
So you do feel it was external?

1612
01:39:40,042 --> 01:39:41,376
It was--

1613
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:44,112
I felt like I was being
guided into there.

1614
01:39:44,146 --> 01:39:46,048
And then I felt

1615
01:39:47,449 --> 01:39:50,818
that person, I don't know
which one it was, I just felt

1616
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:55,223
that-- their emotions and I--
and I almost--

1617
01:39:58,893 --> 01:40:01,363
It was-- I can't explain it,
to be honest.

1618
01:40:01,396 --> 01:40:04,066
It's hard to explain in words

1619
01:40:05,133 --> 01:40:07,835
what the fuck happened.

1620
01:40:07,869 --> 01:40:09,871
Dude,
so from where we were,

1621
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:13,675
it sounded like you fell.

1622
01:40:13,708 --> 01:40:15,643
I fell twice.

1623
01:40:15,677 --> 01:40:16,911
Yeah and we--

1624
01:40:16,944 --> 01:40:19,447
So we got up
and we're like, "What the hell?"

1625
01:40:19,481 --> 01:40:20,848
The thing is like, I was--

1626
01:40:20,882 --> 01:40:22,450
And then when you
started talking--

1627
01:40:22,484 --> 01:40:25,120
I didn't black out.
I was just in a trance.

1628
01:40:25,153 --> 01:40:27,089
I was going to say,
when you first said something,

1629
01:40:27,122 --> 01:40:29,224
it sounded like you weren't
here, you were spaced out

1630
01:40:29,257 --> 01:40:31,193
like, in a way deep trance.

1631
01:40:31,226 --> 01:40:33,795
The moment you said something
I knew like you were--

1632
01:40:33,828 --> 01:40:35,797
You had just come
from somewhere else,

1633
01:40:35,830 --> 01:40:37,232
is what it sounded like.

1634
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:39,601
I felt like I was in

1635
01:40:39,634 --> 01:40:41,069
a completely different
time period,

1636
01:40:41,103 --> 01:40:45,140
like different situation, like,
you guys are away from me.

1637
01:40:45,173 --> 01:40:47,409
I'm like, not even--

1638
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:50,245
It's hard to explain in words,
to be honest.

1639
01:40:50,278 --> 01:40:52,547
So this is something that's
never happened to me before.

1640
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:55,617
I've been oppressed before,
like a couple of times,

1641
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:57,419
but that was just
feeling their emotions.

1642
01:40:57,452 --> 01:41:00,188
But this was a trance,
I've never been in trance

1643
01:41:00,222 --> 01:41:01,656
like this before.

1644
01:41:01,689 --> 01:41:04,692
I've never been,
like, drawn and--

1645
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:09,431
And losing my complete
balance and falling--

1646
01:41:10,798 --> 01:41:12,867
How do you feel now?

1647
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,869
I feel better, like

1648
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:17,105
being out of the house.

1649
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:20,575
Fresh air.

1650
01:41:22,844 --> 01:41:24,246
Dude.

1651
01:41:24,279 --> 01:41:25,813
-Well, hey.
-That's crazy.

1652
01:41:25,847 --> 01:41:27,282
Now that
I know you're okay,

1653
01:41:27,315 --> 01:41:29,083
fist bump
because that was badass.

1654
01:41:29,117 --> 01:41:31,286
You just experienced
something way deep.

1655
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:32,620
That was very deep.

1656
01:41:41,996 --> 01:41:44,031
I've had oppression before,

1657
01:41:44,065 --> 01:41:45,767
like, feeling
someone's emotions,

1658
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:47,502
but I've never been
in a trance like that.

1659
01:41:47,535 --> 01:41:50,638
And I felt like
time stood still.

1660
01:41:50,672 --> 01:41:54,242
One of the things that I
need you to understand is that,

1661
01:41:55,210 --> 01:41:57,612
you know, when you push,
like you did earlier

1662
01:41:57,645 --> 01:41:59,381
with the provocation and such,

1663
01:42:00,348 --> 01:42:02,116
you know, it also
kind of puts us all

1664
01:42:02,150 --> 01:42:03,885
in a little bit of danger, too.

1665
01:42:03,918 --> 01:42:05,187
But at the same time,

1666
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:07,422
just because
nothing happens here

1667
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:10,992
doesn't mean it won't
happen at your home.

1668
01:42:11,025 --> 01:42:13,127
I knew that. I knew that.

1669
01:42:13,161 --> 01:42:15,397
That could also
affect us as well.

1670
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:16,998
Mm-hmm, I'm aware.

1671
01:42:17,031 --> 01:42:18,966
-I'm--
-But I specifically said,

1672
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,869
the invitation's for me
and I got what I wanted.

1673
01:42:22,204 --> 01:42:23,505
That's what I wanted.

1674
01:42:23,805 --> 01:42:25,273
It's not all physical.

1675
01:42:25,607 --> 01:42:28,943
It's--
Most of this is psychological.

1676
01:42:29,311 --> 01:42:30,878
And we have to be careful.

1677
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,480
-And spiritual.
-I know.

1678
01:42:33,448 --> 01:42:36,951
But to be honest,
I kind of liked it.

1679
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:41,055
Like, I want that more.

1680
01:42:47,529 --> 01:42:49,697
My goal from
challenging the entity

1681
01:42:49,731 --> 01:42:51,866
was to invoke a reaction.

1682
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:53,668
Whatever is necessary.

1683
01:42:54,569 --> 01:42:57,038
As an investigator,
I want evidence,

1684
01:42:57,071 --> 01:42:59,407
but at the same time
I do not like

1685
01:42:59,441 --> 01:43:02,510
when an entity is taking
advantage of someone.

1686
01:43:02,544 --> 01:43:06,314
Why can't I take the blows
when I ask for it

1687
01:43:06,348 --> 01:43:08,483
instead of people
like the Perron family?

1688
01:43:08,516 --> 01:43:10,452
And she knows this

1689
01:43:10,485 --> 01:43:12,887
and he told her after

1690
01:43:13,187 --> 01:43:14,856
that he would never
put her through

1691
01:43:14,889 --> 01:43:16,991
anything like that again.

1692
01:43:17,024 --> 01:43:19,727
And she believed her and I think

1693
01:43:20,395 --> 01:43:22,364
aside from "I love you,"

1694
01:43:22,864 --> 01:43:26,234
I think the most
you most powerful words

1695
01:43:26,268 --> 01:43:30,705
in this or any language are,
"I believe you."

1696
01:43:31,473 --> 01:43:33,007
I understand you wouldn't--

1697
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,677
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads up on this

1698
01:43:36,043 --> 01:43:38,913
but I thought this was
a really important story

1699
01:43:39,146 --> 01:43:40,848
to share with people.

1700
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:44,819
I do want to-- I want you to do
good with if you could, honey.

1701
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:48,556
That was that one that...

1702
01:43:51,593 --> 01:43:54,862
I got lucky
and I got an interaction back,

1703
01:43:54,896 --> 01:43:57,565
which doesn't always happen.

1704
01:43:57,599 --> 01:43:59,801
Judging from
all the correlations,

1705
01:43:59,834 --> 01:44:02,537
I was a target
since the beginning.

1706
01:44:03,037 --> 01:44:05,573
I am glad I was.

1707
01:44:05,607 --> 01:44:09,877
I wish this would happen to me
at all locations I investigate.

1708
01:44:09,911 --> 01:44:12,847
I wouldn't mind them
follow me home either.

1709
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:15,383
I want paranormal
phenomena to manifest

1710
01:44:15,417 --> 01:44:17,485
as much as possible in my life.

1711
01:44:17,519 --> 01:44:19,787
This is what I signed up for.

1712
01:44:30,532 --> 01:44:34,068
When we arrived back home,
Joe and I spent hours

1713
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:36,338
reviewing our findings.

1714
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:45,580
After reviewing the footage,
we still did not know

1715
01:44:45,613 --> 01:44:48,550
what was causing
the walkie-talkie interference,

1716
01:44:48,583 --> 01:44:52,354
and we wanted to try
one more time to recreate

1717
01:44:52,387 --> 01:44:54,556
the chair movement
with our new knowledge

1718
01:44:54,589 --> 01:44:58,259
of where Billy stepped when
the rocking chair initiates.

1719
01:44:58,292 --> 01:45:02,397
From when we examined
the DVR footage frame by frame.

1720
01:45:13,541 --> 01:45:15,677
So Joe and I
decided to head back

1721
01:45:15,710 --> 01:45:17,512
to Harrisville, Rhode Island,

1722
01:45:17,545 --> 01:45:19,781
and our good friend, Levy Reyes,

1723
01:45:19,814 --> 01:45:23,084
invited us to join him
at the Farmhouse.

1724
01:45:37,765 --> 01:45:40,968
Alright, so this has been
one hell of a drive.

1725
01:45:41,302 --> 01:45:43,004
The weather is bad,
the roads are bad.

1726
01:45:44,672 --> 01:45:46,007
This is insane.

1727
01:46:20,908 --> 01:46:22,444
Upon trying to debunk

1728
01:46:22,477 --> 01:46:24,879
the walkie talkie
interference with Cory,

1729
01:46:24,912 --> 01:46:28,382
we discovered no interference
could be duplicated.

1730
01:46:31,285 --> 01:46:33,387
Hey, Joe, it's not
doing it any more.

1731
01:46:34,856 --> 01:46:36,858
Yeah, there's nothing here.

1732
01:46:36,891 --> 01:46:39,627
Okay, so channel three
is on right now.

1733
01:46:40,261 --> 01:46:42,229
This is exactly--

1734
01:46:42,263 --> 01:46:44,365
You didn't change anything
with your security cameras

1735
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:46,200
-or anything like that? Nothing?
-No.

1736
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:48,470
Because that's what we were
probably thinking of is

1737
01:46:48,503 --> 01:46:51,072
do you have any wireless stuff
with your security cameras?

1738
01:46:51,105 --> 01:46:52,406
-No.
-No, you don't?

1739
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:54,876
It's all-- Okay.

1740
01:46:55,443 --> 01:46:57,311
I'm on Channel three
right now, look.

1741
01:46:57,344 --> 01:46:59,180
Ten, three.

1742
01:46:59,213 --> 01:47:01,315
Okay, it's three. Same channel.

1743
01:47:04,118 --> 01:47:06,554
It was happening
all the time in this area,

1744
01:47:06,588 --> 01:47:07,689
now it's not happening.

1745
01:47:07,722 --> 01:47:09,691
They changed
out their DVR system.

1746
01:47:09,724 --> 01:47:11,526
They said they didn't.

1747
01:47:12,193 --> 01:47:14,361
Didn't you change it out,
like get a new system?

1748
01:47:14,395 --> 01:47:16,263
We got a new system coming in.

1749
01:47:17,732 --> 01:47:19,166
Like Ethernet.

1750
01:47:20,735 --> 01:47:22,937
Huh.

1751
01:47:24,038 --> 01:47:25,406
This doesn't make sense.

1752
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,542
It was going crazy
on Channel Three.

1753
01:47:28,910 --> 01:47:32,747
What the heck?
Why can't we recreate it now?

1754
01:47:35,182 --> 01:47:36,784
It was going insane.

1755
01:47:37,685 --> 01:47:40,321
So you didn't do
any new things electrically?

1756
01:47:44,158 --> 01:47:46,093
It is on if it helps.

1757
01:47:46,494 --> 01:47:48,830
Like, I was thinking it was
gonna be easy to recreate again

1758
01:47:48,863 --> 01:47:50,031
because we were
able to recreate it

1759
01:47:50,064 --> 01:47:51,666
over and over again
when we were there.

1760
01:47:51,699 --> 01:47:54,268
But now, if you didn't change
anything electrically...

1761
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:56,571
-No.
-That's kind of weird.

1762
01:47:58,606 --> 01:48:00,875
Since Cory states,
he has not changed

1763
01:48:00,908 --> 01:48:02,944
anything electrically
at the house,

1764
01:48:02,977 --> 01:48:04,512
a natural explanation

1765
01:48:04,546 --> 01:48:07,014
couldn't be found
for what we experienced

1766
01:48:07,048 --> 01:48:09,216
that night
with the walkie-talkies.

1767
01:48:10,151 --> 01:48:12,887
Okay, so right now
we are back about

1768
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,488
nine, ten months later

1769
01:48:14,756 --> 01:48:16,724
after the original footage

1770
01:48:16,758 --> 01:48:19,026
when we captured
the chair moving.

1771
01:48:19,226 --> 01:48:21,428
Bill, after reviewing
the footage,

1772
01:48:21,462 --> 01:48:23,931
we noticed he steps exactly

1773
01:48:24,131 --> 01:48:26,668
at this crack right here

1774
01:48:26,868 --> 01:48:28,903
and we want to
know approximately

1775
01:48:28,936 --> 01:48:31,338
the distance that he was

1776
01:48:31,372 --> 01:48:33,074
when he stepped from the chair.

1777
01:48:33,107 --> 01:48:36,410
As you can tell, the stubs
right here are very short.

1778
01:48:36,443 --> 01:48:38,980
So he obviously
did not step on the stub

1779
01:48:39,013 --> 01:48:41,248
to accidentally make
this go like that.

1780
01:48:41,282 --> 01:48:43,585
And so what we're going to do

1781
01:48:43,618 --> 01:48:46,087
is measure about the distance.

1782
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:48,222
So if he stepped
right around here

1783
01:48:48,556 --> 01:48:51,492
and they'll say
his foot probably was--

1784
01:48:51,525 --> 01:48:53,360
Let's use my boots for

1785
01:48:53,394 --> 01:48:55,029
Yeah, let's use your boot
for an example.

1786
01:48:55,062 --> 01:48:56,197
Yeah.

1787
01:48:56,230 --> 01:48:57,765
This is an estimation obviously.

1788
01:48:57,799 --> 01:49:00,001
He probably has a bigger foot
or smaller foot, we don't know.

1789
01:49:00,034 --> 01:49:02,303
-These are a 12, so--
-Put your foot here.

1790
01:49:03,671 --> 01:49:05,372
Put it where exactly?

1791
01:49:05,406 --> 01:49:07,975
Right there is fine.
So estimation.

1792
01:49:08,943 --> 01:49:10,912
Well, I was right about a foot.

1793
01:49:10,945 --> 01:49:13,314
A little bit over a foot,
13 inches

1794
01:49:13,347 --> 01:49:14,916
from where
he's standing right here.

1795
01:49:14,949 --> 01:49:16,618
And that's when this moved.

1796
01:49:16,651 --> 01:49:18,519
Now, back up.

1797
01:49:19,921 --> 01:49:22,289
13 inches away approximately.

1798
01:49:22,757 --> 01:49:24,358
Probably the same for Bill.

1799
01:49:24,992 --> 01:49:26,193
And

1800
01:49:27,461 --> 01:49:28,730
look at this.

1801
01:49:30,965 --> 01:49:34,468
It doesn't even move.
It doesn't budge at all.

1802
01:49:34,501 --> 01:49:36,137
Not even a little bit.

1803
01:49:36,437 --> 01:49:38,505
So that right there

1804
01:49:39,841 --> 01:49:41,743
is some amazing evidence.

1805
01:49:41,776 --> 01:49:43,778
I'm pretty excited
about this one.

1806
01:49:44,812 --> 01:49:46,113
The cool thing about this is

1807
01:49:46,147 --> 01:49:49,784
how many angles we
have when this happens.

1808
01:49:49,817 --> 01:49:52,086
We have about, I think
four cameras or so

1809
01:49:52,119 --> 01:49:53,955
and plus DVR cameras
and all that.

1810
01:49:54,521 --> 01:49:56,590
That's a lot of cameras
running at the moment.

1811
01:49:56,624 --> 01:49:58,292
And we had a live stream going,

1812
01:49:58,325 --> 01:50:02,463
which was Eric's live stream
when it happened.

1813
01:50:02,496 --> 01:50:05,532
Like, I have a 4K camera,
multiple--

1814
01:50:05,566 --> 01:50:07,368
A couple 4K cameras,

1815
01:50:07,401 --> 01:50:10,271
literally pointing at the chair
right after it happens.

1816
01:50:10,304 --> 01:50:13,207
It's extremely obvious
there's no string

1817
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:16,343
and we're--
Literally with the lights on,

1818
01:50:16,811 --> 01:50:20,081
you will be able to see that
string if there was one so...

1819
01:50:22,817 --> 01:50:26,453
I think this is classified
as paranormal

1820
01:50:27,121 --> 01:50:28,455
without a doubt.

1821
01:50:40,501 --> 01:50:43,370
The next morning when
I was transferring SD cards

1822
01:50:43,404 --> 01:50:46,307
and packing up our gear
to get ready to leave,

1823
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:50,477
all of a sudden I heard water
running in the restroom.

1824
01:50:50,511 --> 01:50:51,879
There was no one in there

1825
01:50:51,913 --> 01:50:54,749
and I was the only one
awake at the time.

1826
01:51:17,038 --> 01:51:19,707
Joe? Paranormal experience.

1827
01:51:39,160 --> 01:51:42,029
Okay, so this was
not caught on camera.

1828
01:51:54,008 --> 01:51:55,442
Somebody in here?

1829
01:52:23,170 --> 01:52:24,972
It has a lot of force.

1830
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:31,578
You need a lot of force
to that to move it.

1831
01:52:32,046 --> 01:52:33,514
It's not loose.

1832
01:52:52,466 --> 01:52:55,336
The Hollywood film,
The Conjuring.

1833
01:52:55,369 --> 01:52:59,306
Overdramatized and embellishes
what actually happened.

1834
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:02,009
But the question
we wanted answered was,

1835
01:53:02,043 --> 01:53:04,678
is the infamous
Harrisville Farmhouse

1836
01:53:04,711 --> 01:53:08,549
truly that next level
haunted location?

1837
01:53:08,582 --> 01:53:10,351
From the evidence we captured,

1838
01:53:10,384 --> 01:53:12,653
including our
personal experiences,

1839
01:53:12,686 --> 01:53:16,323
we can conclude the house
is definitely more active

1840
01:53:16,357 --> 01:53:18,993
than most locations
we have investigated.

1841
01:53:19,493 --> 01:53:23,564
It was The Conjuring
that brought our truth to light

1842
01:53:23,597 --> 01:53:27,168
and gave me the opportunity

1843
01:53:27,201 --> 01:53:31,839
to tell the world that yes, the
truth is stranger than fiction.

1844
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:34,441
I know what some might think

1845
01:53:34,475 --> 01:53:37,144
after watching this documentary,

1846
01:53:37,178 --> 01:53:40,247
is the footage
we captured truly real?

1847
01:53:40,281 --> 01:53:42,183
-It's moving. It's moving.
-Move. Move--

1848
01:53:43,317 --> 01:53:46,220
Was it all
a hoax for a film?

1849
01:53:46,253 --> 01:53:49,256
Psychologist Leon Festinger
said it best.

1850
01:54:03,971 --> 01:54:06,840
What he is talking about
is a psychological theory

1851
01:54:06,874 --> 01:54:09,210
called cognitive dissonance.

1852
01:54:09,243 --> 01:54:11,812
"Psychological conflict
resulting from

1853
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:14,415
incongruous beliefs
and attitudes

1854
01:54:14,448 --> 01:54:17,251
held simultaneously."

1855
01:54:17,284 --> 01:54:21,155
In other words, what we
presented in this documentary

1856
01:54:21,188 --> 01:54:23,590
is 100% real.

1857
01:54:23,624 --> 01:54:25,159
Like the lighting
because they're like,

1858
01:54:25,192 --> 01:54:26,894
you know how like the-- The--

1859
01:54:26,928 --> 01:54:30,531
-These things are--
-Right there. Oh, shit!

1860
01:54:30,564 --> 01:54:32,166
Wow.

1861
01:54:32,199 --> 01:54:33,567
-Dude.
-That's why I was like, oh shit.

1862
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:36,003
-Look at this.
-That's badass, dude.

1863
01:54:36,037 --> 01:54:38,339
-Yeah.
-And look how fast it stopped.

1864
01:54:38,372 --> 01:54:39,406
Yeah.

1865
01:54:40,674 --> 01:54:43,210
But no matter how
much evidence we present

1866
01:54:43,244 --> 01:54:45,112
towards paranormal phenomenon,

1867
01:54:45,146 --> 01:54:47,614
many will deny it.

1868
01:54:47,648 --> 01:54:50,017
Cognitive dissonance
can be a problem

1869
01:54:50,051 --> 01:54:52,686
among sceptics and believers.

1870
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:56,690
As a paranormal investigator,
I try my best to be unbiased

1871
01:54:56,723 --> 01:55:00,127
and present our findings
through the art of film.

1872
01:55:00,161 --> 01:55:02,296
Is there any experiences
that you've had

1873
01:55:02,329 --> 01:55:04,631
or any of your family members

1874
01:55:05,866 --> 01:55:07,668
for mimicking,

1875
01:55:07,701 --> 01:55:10,171
like mimicking other people.

1876
01:55:10,204 --> 01:55:11,405
Yes.

1877
01:55:11,438 --> 01:55:13,207
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

1878
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:16,343
Oh, okay.
Let's go in depth with that.

1879
01:55:16,377 --> 01:55:18,845
Bathsheba came through--

1880
01:55:18,879 --> 01:55:22,083
Well, a few years ago, I was
doing a spirit bath session

1881
01:55:22,449 --> 01:55:26,053
and I was working
with my paranormal partner

1882
01:55:26,087 --> 01:55:27,955
at the time, George Lopez,

1883
01:55:29,523 --> 01:55:31,925
and she came through

1884
01:55:32,793 --> 01:55:34,595
with my voice.

1885
01:55:34,828 --> 01:55:37,664
And he said, "No, no, no, no.

1886
01:55:37,698 --> 01:55:39,733
You don't use Andrea's voice,

1887
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:43,971
you use your own voice or we
can't have this conversation."

1888
01:55:44,371 --> 01:55:48,042
And then she came through
with that child-like voice

1889
01:55:48,442 --> 01:55:49,843
that I recognized.

1890
01:55:49,876 --> 01:55:51,645
And I heard a little
girl say, "Daddy."

1891
01:55:53,247 --> 01:55:55,482
I was feeling
very disoriented.

1892
01:55:55,516 --> 01:56:00,554
Yes, and I-- Someone being
terrified of something,

1893
01:56:00,587 --> 01:56:03,190
just complete terror
is what I felt.

1894
01:56:03,224 --> 01:56:07,028
Well, there was an incident
that occurred

1895
01:56:07,061 --> 01:56:10,131
when my sister Cindy was 14,

1896
01:56:11,198 --> 01:56:15,136
where a black mass that she saw
hovering above me in bed

1897
01:56:15,702 --> 01:56:19,373
swept down off of me
and grabbed her by the ankles

1898
01:56:19,406 --> 01:56:24,045
and dragged her down, partially
down the bedroom stairs.

1899
01:56:25,279 --> 01:56:26,847
The bedroom
that was my bedroom,

1900
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,549
right,
directly above the parlour.

1901
01:56:28,582 --> 01:56:30,551
Wow. I didn't even
know this story.

1902
01:56:30,584 --> 01:56:32,786
That's really intriguing. Wow.

1903
01:56:33,454 --> 01:56:35,689
So that was my vision
of being dragged

1904
01:56:35,722 --> 01:56:37,858
also by a shadowy mass and--

1905
01:56:37,891 --> 01:56:40,927
Cindy was terrified
out of her mind that night.

1906
01:56:40,961 --> 01:56:42,663
-Terrified!
-Wow.

1907
01:56:43,464 --> 01:56:46,867
Okay, I might have felt her.

1908
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:48,869
I am not
making the bold claim

1909
01:56:48,902 --> 01:56:53,640
that what we encountered here
is without a doubt, ghosts.

1910
01:56:53,674 --> 01:56:56,843
But objects are being
moved on their own here.

1911
01:56:57,744 --> 01:57:02,483
Fucking shit!

1912
01:57:02,516 --> 01:57:05,886
Holy shit!

1913
01:57:07,154 --> 01:57:08,822
Oh, my God.

1914
01:57:10,624 --> 01:57:12,025
Yeah.

1915
01:57:16,230 --> 01:57:18,299
What the fuck!

1916
01:57:21,068 --> 01:57:23,570
It was all over the place.

1917
01:57:24,738 --> 01:57:27,241
Holy shit, dude.

1918
01:57:28,742 --> 01:57:32,546
And that is truly
paranormal phenomena.

1919
01:57:32,579 --> 01:57:35,316
Something we don't
exactly understand yet

1920
01:57:35,349 --> 01:57:37,651
and defies our known
laws of physics.

1921
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:40,887
Science always changes.

1922
01:57:40,921 --> 01:57:43,557
One day we might have
some of the answers,

1923
01:57:43,590 --> 01:57:46,760
but until then,
we keep searching.

1924
01:57:47,828 --> 01:57:50,631
Matt, every time
somebody like you

1925
01:57:50,664 --> 01:57:54,135
goes into that house
with the owner's permission

1926
01:57:54,168 --> 01:57:57,104
and has their own
experiences in there,

1927
01:57:57,338 --> 01:58:01,442
and what you do serves
to vindicate and validate

1928
01:58:01,475 --> 01:58:03,844
my family's story.

1929
01:58:03,877 --> 01:58:08,649
Every time you compile more
and more evidence,

1930
01:58:09,583 --> 01:58:12,419
it serves to validate our story.
