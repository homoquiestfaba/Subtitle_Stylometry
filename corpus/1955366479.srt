MICHAEL JACKSON - BLACK OR WHITE

2
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,814
I took my girl on a Saturday bang

3
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,766
Boy is that girl with you
Yes we're one and the same

4
00:00:56,278 --> 00:00:58,003
Now I believe in miracles

5
00:00:58,444 --> 00:01:01,065
And a miracle happened tonight.

6
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,365
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby

7
00:01:06,408 --> 00:01:09,533
It don't matter if you're black or white


8
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:37,730
They print my message in the Saturday Sun

9
00:01:38,436 --> 00:01:41,731
I had to tell them I ain't second to none


10
00:01:42,057 --> 00:01:43,936
And I told about equality and it's true


11
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,116
Either you're wrong or you're right


12
00:01:49,586 --> 00:01:52,245
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby

13
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:55,489
It don't matter if you're black or white




14
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,928
I am tired of this devil

15
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:31,971
I am tired of this stuff

16
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:34,053
I'm tired of this business,

17
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:36,194
Sew when the going gets rough

18
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:38,202
I ain't scared of your brother

19
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,290
I ain'ts scared of no sheets

20
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:42,070
I ain't scared of nobody

21
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:44,508
Girl when the going gets tough

22
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,014
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations

23
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:51,091
Causing grief in human relations

24
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:53,145
It's a turf war on a global scale



25
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:55,204
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale.

26
00:02:55,337 --> 00:02:57,866
See, it's not about races, just places, faces.

27
00:02:58,274 --> 00:02:59,950
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is .

28
00:03:00,277 --> 00:03:01,504
I've seen the bright get duller

29
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:03,505
I'm not going to spend my life being a color


30
00:03:03,836 --> 00:03:05,300
Do not tell me you agree with me 

31
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:08,527
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye




32
00:03:11,138 --> 00:03:13,536
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby

33
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,528
It don't matter if you're black or white




34
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:21,862
I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby



35
00:03:22,054 --> 00:03:25,016
It don't matter if you're black or white




36
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:28,382
I said if

37
00:03:28,548 --> 00:03:30,243
You are thinking of being my brother

38
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,499
It don't matter if you're black or white




39
00:03:37,002 --> 00:03:38,496
It's black, it's white

40
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:41,309
It's tough for them to get by

41
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:44,189
It's black, it's white Whoo

42
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,925
It's black, it's white

43
00:03:47,313 --> 00:03:49,700
It's tough for them to get by

44
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:18,047
