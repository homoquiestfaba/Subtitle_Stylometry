1
00:00:01,021 --> 00:00:04,021
(subtle jazz music)

2
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:19,373
(subtle jazz music)

3
00:00:19,373 --> 00:00:22,499
- Hey Mickey, you should be a comedian.

4
00:00:22,499 --> 00:00:25,539
(laughter)

5
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:28,539
(subtle rock music)

6
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:33,389
(laughter)

7
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,560
- Hey Bernie, how's he doing?

8
00:00:45,026 --> 00:00:48,026
(subtle rock music)

9
00:00:54,752 --> 00:00:56,630
- [Mickey] Yeah, I had
a really good day today.

10
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,540
I woke up, I ran the marathon,

11
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,510
got my balls pierced,
got my tongue pierced,

12
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,340
got a couple of tattoos on my forehead

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,960
and uh, uh, I still at
time at the end of the day

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,233
for a root canal job.

15
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,347
Uh, I joined the cellular craze too.

16
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:11,840
You know, they got these
new phones that vibrate,

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,370
so I bought three of them actually.

18
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,680
One, I use for calling,
one, I stuck up my ass,

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,280
one, I got wrapped around my dick.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,823
Here's my number, let it ring a long time.

21
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,840
You got to hand it to Chris Reed

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,070
for putting so much
emphasis on spinal research,

23
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,903
but I, I don't know.

24
00:01:28,903 --> 00:01:30,440
I mean, is it a smart idea

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,170
to compete in the sport as an amateur

26
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,623
where there's a uh,
ambulance at the finish line?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,140
Oh, what's the matter, sir?

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,017
Don't you understand English?

29
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:41,238
- Actually, I speak perfect
English, you're just not funny.

30
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:42,970
(laughter)

31
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,480
- [Mickey] That's my
time, ladies and gentlemen

32
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,340
and I also want to say thank you.

33
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,450
I've had a good time.

34
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,987
Get off me, will ya?

35
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:50,460
Who the fuck is this guy?

36
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,373
Out of here.

37
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:53,875
Ah, fuck you.

38
00:01:55,062 --> 00:01:58,062
(subtle rock music)

39
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:14,320
- Hey Mickey, you should be a comedian.

40
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,969
- Hey Bernie, blow me.

41
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:19,219
(laughter)

42
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,053
- Sell it, baby!

43
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:28,840
- Just come to the plate with me.

44
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,000
- We got investors.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,010
- What is the bottom line?

46
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,920
- We have investors and people closing!

47
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,040
- I'm not saying don't
pay your medical bills.

48
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,300
- Or can you not close
your eyes in a hurricane?

49
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,900
- But if I double your money in a month.

50
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,380
- Can you close or can you not close?

51
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,480
- Now we decide if you piss standing up,

52
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,100
or if you piss sitting down.

53
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,049
- Wake up.

54
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:46,990
- Huh, huh?

55
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,560
- Getting into bed with
Mickey, as they say,

56
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,680
is so safe, you don't even need a condom!

57
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,850
What are you worried about?

58
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,940
You're making money!

59
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,610
- Get your checkbook, I'll hold.

60
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,480
- Hey, you saw that, you saw it?

61
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,883
Good for you, pink slip!

62
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,373
- Hi Audrey.

63
00:03:01,373 --> 00:03:02,206
- Fuck off.

64
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,470
- So what the fuck's going on, Mickey?

65
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,530
- [Mickey] Watch your language.

66
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,363
- Yeah, I'm gonna shove this phone

67
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:10,360
so far up your fucking ass,

68
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,180
your mouth will have a dial tone.

69
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,510
- [Mickey] Why can't you drive her?

70
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,500
- Blow me!

71
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,260
- I asked one favor.

72
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,093
- Yeah.

73
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:20,720
- Well, why can't you just
do me one favor as a friend?

74
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,710
- The only way you're gonna
close a deal, all right?

75
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,660
You gotta be aggressive!

76
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,740
- Fuck you, Mickey.

77
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,020
- There has to be some log,

78
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,010
it's harassment in the workplace.

79
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,700
I'm not gonna take this from you.

80
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,900
- You're gonna do this
for me, you have to.

81
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,723
- No, I'm not going to do it for you.

82
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,729
What?

83
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:39,560
Is this supposed to scare me?

84
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,290
- Do you ever see giraffes fuck?

85
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,050
They don't stop until they've done it!

86
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,890
- Why don't you take your gerbil, and uh.

87
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,930
- Did this guy just, did
you just call me a pussy?

88
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,020
- Yeah, I just called him a pussy!

89
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,433
- Take the livestock with you, all right?

90
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:51,240
- Livestock, nice.

91
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,857
- Fine, I used to sell a lot
when I was in Boy Scouts.

92
00:03:53,857 --> 00:03:55,468
- Oh yeah, I'm sure you
did a lot of cookies.

93
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,440
So you were in the Girl Scouts?

94
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,430
- Hello Mister.

95
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,785
- I'm not doing it.

96
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:00,118
- [Audrey] Yes you are!

97
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:01,118
- No, don't.

98
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:10,470
- You're late.

99
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,210
- Audrey said 10 o'clock, it's 10 o'clock.

100
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,560
What are you talking about?

101
00:04:15,718 --> 00:04:17,300
- Have you ever heard the expression,

102
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,983
if you're not 10 minutes
early, you're late?

103
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,860
- No, I haven't.

104
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,183
Have you ever heard the expression

105
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:25,790
that if you want to get
to where you're going,

106
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,833
call a tow truck?

107
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,013
- Francis!

108
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,410
- Excuse me.

109
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,243
- Of course.

110
00:04:47,676 --> 00:04:49,176
- One, two, three.

111
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,770
- [Dad] Francis!

112
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,453
Your sister, she's on the phone.

113
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,470
- Can you open the doors please?

114
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,113
And pull that lever up.

115
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:27,802
- This?

116
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:28,635
- Yes.

117
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,503
Hit the top orange button on the left.

118
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,740
- Thanks for the warning.

119
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:46,184
- And then the red button
on the left, please.

120
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,963
Can you step on the ledge?

121
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,507
I go on backwards.

122
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:07,275
Okay.

123
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:08,858
Just hold the door.

124
00:06:11,077 --> 00:06:12,753
- Like this?

125
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,443
Jesus Christ.

126
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,850
Yeah, this is a lot better.

127
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,283
- Just close the door.

128
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,200
- How are your nuts?

129
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,250
- Fine, thanks.

130
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,746
How are yours?

131
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:53,579
(whimsical music)

132
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,970
- Stop sign.

133
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,314
- [Mickey] Yeah, I see the stop sign.

134
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:04,147
What about it?

135
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:05,450
- Stop at it.

136
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,550
Don't roll through it.

137
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,040
Where'd you learn how to drive?

138
00:07:09,915 --> 00:07:10,965
- What's her problem?

139
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:15,530
Like you don't know what
I'm talking about, right?

140
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,500
- Stop sign.

141
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,884
- [Mickey] I see the stop sign

142
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,250
and I'm going to stop the car.

143
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,083
- Stop at it.

144
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:20,916
- [Mickey] I'm stop,

145
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,820
you can't feel the fucking car stopping?

146
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,170
- [Sally] I almost flew out of my chair.

147
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,883
- I'm going to go now.

148
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:32,252
- [Sally] No, no, no.

149
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,250
- [Mickey] Which way do you mean?

150
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,203
- [Sally] Just turn right here.

151
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,590
Just pay attention, would ya?

152
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,150
- [Mickey] I was paying attention.

153
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,003
- To the road.

154
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,160
Right down there where
the people are standing.

155
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,363
Easy over the bump.

156
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:53,520
- [Mickey] Look at this.

157
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,588
What's happening here?

158
00:07:54,588 --> 00:07:55,638
There's your picture.

159
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,483
- I am.

160
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,323
- [Francis] I'll get the
door, you get the straps.

161
00:08:06,323 --> 00:08:08,413
- Uh no, I'll get the door.

162
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,020
Come on, one side, let me through.

163
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,087
Come on, look out.

164
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:20,770
Come on, get back will ya?

165
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,370
Come on, this thing's dangerous.

166
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,490
Hey, I warned ya.

167
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,473
Here it comes.

168
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,933
Behold.

169
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,033
- Hey Jack.

170
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,350
Oh uh, Jack Walker, this is.

171
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,760
- Mickey Schwinn.

172
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,710
- Welcome, Jack.

173
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,763
- To meet you, nice.

174
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,220
I'm going to go find
the handicapped entrance

175
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,733
and uh, look inside, okay?

176
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,140
- Listen, I'll take it from here.

177
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,920
Why don't you find the moron entrance

178
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,750
and come and watch the show?

179
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,000
- Ready, Sally?

180
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,223
- Right on, Jack.

181
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,377
- [Reporter] I'm here at the University

182
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:09,830
and the crowd you see behind me

183
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,450
is here to welcome Dr. Sally
Kelly back to the University.

184
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,140
Dr. Kelly is the world famous
physicist and astronomer

185
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,250
whose book, I Need My Space,

186
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,983
is the number one seller
on the New York Times.

187
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,563
Can I help you?

188
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:26,790
- I work with Dr. Kelly, we work together.

189
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,150
My name is Mickey Schwinn.

190
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,990
- Oh, that's great, sir.

191
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,823
Could you just step away?

192
00:09:29,823 --> 00:09:31,740
I'm doing an interview for television.

193
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,573
- So am I.

194
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,670
- [Sally] So, Audrey says
you're in a comedy show.

195
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,550
- [Mickey] Yeah, I do open mic.

196
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,650
- [Sally] To the left.

197
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,953
- Adios.

198
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,350
- [Sally] Look uh, thanks for helping me.

199
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,650
Maybe I'll owe you dinner or something.

200
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,730
- Yeah, okay.

201
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,880
- [Sally] Sorry about the leg thing.

202
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,190
- Don't worry about it.

203
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,383
Yeah, sure, bye.

204
00:10:14,227 --> 00:10:16,460
(phone ringing)

205
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,293
- Hello?

206
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:20,170
- What's the matter, you
got a dick in your mouth?

207
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,693
- Mickey, how did it go?

208
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,540
What happened?

209
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,574
- What a cunt, that's what happened.

210
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:32,433
- Were you mean to her, Mickey?

211
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,333
Mickey!

212
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,063
You bastard!

213
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,480
(phone ringing)

214
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,470
- Don't fucking ask me
if I hung up on you,

215
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,020
'cause you know I did.

216
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,220
- [Sally] Hello, Mickey.

217
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,963
It's Sally here.

218
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,480
Sally Kelly.

219
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,620
I wanted to thank you
for driving me today.

220
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,020
- You did already.

221
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,440
- [Sally] Well, I'd still
like to take you out to dinner

222
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,273
and thank you.

223
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:57,570
- Why don't you send over a pizza here

224
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,113
and we'll call it quits?

225
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,850
- All right, what address?

226
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,323
Uh huh, and what toppings?

227
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,673
Drink?

228
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,563
Second choice?

229
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,363
Fine, I'll have it delivered
right over and thanks again.

230
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,243
What a prick.

231
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,240
- How are we doing today?

232
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,670
- I was supposed to call, wasn't I?

233
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,970
- [Jack] Sally, can I get you anything?

234
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:42,803
Glass of water?

235
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:45,170
- No, I'm okay.

236
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,470
What's up?

237
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,840
- Your book tour.

238
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,060
I strongly suggest you reconsider flying.

239
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,020
- Okay, I'll think about it, no.

240
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,123
- Who's going to drive you, Sally?

241
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:55,830
- What do you mean, who
is going to drive me?

242
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,450
Joseph is going to drive me.

243
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,730
He should be back from
his stupid funeral by now.

244
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,150
- Sally, there was no funeral.

245
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,090
He doesn't want to come back.

246
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,840
He quit.

247
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,170
- Why?

248
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,760
Jo likes me.

249
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,436
- Joseph doesn't like you.

250
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:12,269
- Oh.

251
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,630
Give him more money.

252
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,940
- Sir.

253
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,493
Yeah, sir.

254
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,323
Look, sir.

255
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,230
I tell you what, you let
me know when you're through

256
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,523
and let me know when
it's my turn, all right?

257
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,693
Yes.

258
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,563
Yes.

259
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,380
Look at your close, look
at the closing statement.

260
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,340
Look at it and look
where it says net worth.

261
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,890
That's all you want to look at.

262
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,683
Jesus.

263
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,243
- Oh, Mr. Schwinn.

264
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,330
- Yard sale?

265
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,720
- Yeah, yard sale.

266
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,950
More like a client who dropped
by to review his portfolio,

267
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,490
didn't like what he saw.

268
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,760
You know how much money I
made for this guy last year?

269
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,730
- [Mickey] No.

270
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,830
- Tell you, $308,000,

271
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,130
but because I said it
was going to be $400,000,

272
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,660
he does this to my desk.

273
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,800
Greed, it's the deadliest of all the sins.

274
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,633
- Yeah Trent,

275
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:19,360
I got a guy who sent in
$20,000 for silver to go up.

276
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,430
It went up.

277
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,530
Copper to go down, it went down.

278
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,800
He's got $3,000 left in his account.

279
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,460
What's happening?

280
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,293
- Is he outside?

281
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,640
- No, he's in Arkansas.

282
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,076
- That's good.

283
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:33,190
- [Mickey] Hey Trent,

284
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,550
Trent, you're dotting the
I's and crossing the T's?

285
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,350
- Yep, but this is probably
a mistake in accounting.

286
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,310
- You're accounting.

287
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,070
- Yeah, I am accounting and
you're being taken care of.

288
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,240
- I ain't talking about me.

289
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,640
- Well listen to this, okay?

290
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,530
I am as blue blooded and
all American and God-fearing

291
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,200
as any businessman in this country, okay?

292
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,130
But I'm the little guy,

293
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,800
I'm not a big conglomerate, all right?

294
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,880
This company works on my
blood, sweat, and tears.

295
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,790
- I don't give a flying fuck

296
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,640
about your blood, sweat, and tears, okay?

297
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,400
You call this guy, you talk to him,

298
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,960
and then I'm going to talk
to him after you talk to him.

299
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,350
- Yeah, I'll call him.

300
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,330
- When?

301
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,153
- I gotta get my phone
fixed first, it's broken.

302
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:11,923
- Call this guy.

303
00:14:11,923 --> 00:14:14,793
Um, I'll leave the file
on your uh, your desk.

304
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,210
Call him, I'm not kidding around.

305
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,120
- I'll call him, all right?

306
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,063
You go do what you do,
just bringing money in.

307
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,283
- [Mr. Costello] Hey, anybody out there?

308
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:32,633
Come on, let's go.

309
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,283
So, you ready for your report card?

310
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,393
- I want my own spot.

311
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,631
- I know you do.

312
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:48,631
- I think I'm ready.

313
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,873
- Majority to one.

314
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,053
- Mr. Costello, am I wasting my time?

315
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,570
- Yeah, no.

316
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,010
I mean, no, no.

317
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,430
It's not.

318
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,270
You see, Mickey, there's
something missing, you know?

319
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,990
I mean, I don't know.

320
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,690
I mean, I saw a sack the other night

321
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,740
and this guy, right?

322
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,203
He was kind of uh,

323
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,743
you know,

324
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,690
I don't know.

325
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,638
Oh, he was doing this thing, you know?

326
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:23,555
And he was,

327
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:26,404
you know,

328
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,463
I don't know, guess you had to be there.

329
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:33,860
- You sure you were?

330
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,630
- You ain't ready.

331
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,970
I'm going to take a pass.

332
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,323
- So what do I do?

333
00:15:43,323 --> 00:15:45,600
I just beat it around
town, doing the standup,

334
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,940
doing the open mic and you
tell me when I'm ready,

335
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,840
that how it works?

336
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,560
- Yeah, yeah.

337
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,330
Open mic, yeah.

338
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,630
- And you think I'm funny?

339
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,170
- Yeah, yeah.

340
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,390
I mean, you know, you
keep doing it, you know,

341
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,810
the mic, and the, yeah.

342
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,683
- Mr. Costello, thanks for
your time and the pep talk.

343
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,553
- Hey, all right.

344
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,110
- I don't know what you guys do in there,

345
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,350
but I wouldn't go in there right now.

346
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,183
- Why?

347
00:16:18,183 --> 00:16:20,140
- There's a lot of guys in
green jackets that say sheriff.

348
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,553
- Have a nice weekend.

349
00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:27,840
- What the fuck happened?

350
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,090
- We got shut down.

351
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:29,923
- Why?

352
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:30,756
- I don't know.

353
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,212
- Who are they looking for?

354
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:35,462
(overlapping speaking)

355
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,243
- Hey, hey Mickey man,

356
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:40,430
I saw you on TV with some
chick on wheels, man,

357
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,078
on the news, man, what's
up, what's that about?

358
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:43,136
- You saw that?

359
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,219
How'd I look?

360
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:50,710
(engine revving)

361
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,210
- [Sally] God dammit, you made me,

362
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,955
do you know that there's nobody there?

363
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:55,970
- I'm sorry.

364
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,610
- What are you, a stupid idiot?

365
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,980
- I'm sorry.

366
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,846
- Save sorry for your boyfriend.

367
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:04,846
(upbeat rock music)

368
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,853
- Hello?

369
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:23,580
- [Sally] That homosexual prick, Joseph,

370
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,690
just left me on the side of the road.

371
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,523
- Where are you?

372
00:17:26,523 --> 00:17:27,520
- [Sally] I'm at the observatory,

373
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,340
I was picking up some stuff.

374
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,520
- Well, did you call the
Automobile Association of America?

375
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,630
- [Sally] Look, you don't
want to come and pick me up?

376
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,210
- No, no, no, I'm not saying that.

377
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,390
I'm, I'm not saying that
I don't want to come over.

378
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,172
Look hold on, I'll take care of it.

379
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:42,839
(phone ringing)

380
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,560
- Mickey here.

381
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,760
- [Audrey] Mickey, I need a favor.

382
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,380
Mickey?

383
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,510
Mickey!

384
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,343
Mickey!

385
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,240
- Yes?

386
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,329
- [Audrey] Look, it's Sally.

387
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:57,431
She just called, she's
hysterical, she's stranded.

388
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:58,807
Where are you?

389
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:00,067
- [Mickey] I'm in my car, Audrey.

390
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:01,650
I'm on the fucking 405.

391
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,630
I haven't moved more than
nine inches in the last hour.

392
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,520
They stopped traffic,

393
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,590
I'm in the middle of a fucking
boom box gang war, okay?

394
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,040
That's where I am.

395
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,300
- Well, can you just get
over there and help her out?

396
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,980
- Why don't you?

397
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,210
- Mickey, I'm on a fucking
bust job, for Christ's sake.

398
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,620
I've got a DUI, he said he needs help.

399
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,503
Mickey!

400
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,963
- Where is she?

401
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,543
- No keys?

402
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,610
- Nope.

403
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,040
- Okay.

404
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,830
Yeah, yeah.

405
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,230
Yeah, 30 minutes, all right.

406
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,823
Are you sure you can't hot wire the car?

407
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,683
- Yeah, I'm, I'm sure I don't
know how to steal a car.

408
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,050
- So you ever going to
ask me what happened?

409
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:58,883
- No.

410
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,250
- About four years ago,

411
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,600
I was celebrating my important book deal

412
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,190
and it was raining really hard

413
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,360
and I had brought my new
Mercedes convertible over.

414
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,090
- I'm sorry, did you
say you were a doctor?

415
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,863
What a fucking racket that is?

416
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,793
How's business?

417
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,373
- Good, I'm uh,

418
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,580
just starting to get ready for a book tour

419
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,170
and my publisher's sending
me out for a book signing

420
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,800
and local lectures at local campuses.

421
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,963
You know how it is?

422
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:37,470
- Do you have a private jet or something?

423
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,550
- No, I'm taking the van.

424
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,680
- Who are you going with?

425
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,418
- [Sally] Francis, my nurse and Audrey.

426
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:44,960
- Audrey's gonna flake,

427
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,380
so that leaves you and Florence
Nightingale out on the road.

428
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,673
- Florence doesn't drive.

429
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:52,810
How about you?

430
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,410
- [Mickey] Oh, you know,
the business with me

431
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:59,200
is like gangbusters, phones
literally off the hook

432
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,363
and the comedy thing,

433
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,110
fuck, I mean, you know.

434
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:10,812
(upbeat music)

435
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:21,890
- [Sally] The cosmological
expansion due to, did you get it?

436
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,190
- I'll be honest with you, all right?

437
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,730
I don't get it.

438
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,563
I mean,

439
00:20:25,563 --> 00:20:29,710
how many people do you know
who don't have physics degrees?

440
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,660
- Do you understand, Francis?

441
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,493
- I get it.

442
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:33,326
- [Sally] See?

443
00:20:33,326 --> 00:20:34,159
- Yeah, do you now?

444
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:34,992
- Yeah.

445
00:20:34,992 --> 00:20:36,100
- All right, then explain it to me.

446
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,440
Tell it to me like you're
telling it to a 10 year old.

447
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,273
- Okay.

448
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:40,106
- What is it?

449
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,760
- I can't explain it, I'm hungry.

450
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,707
- [Mickey] Okay so the answer
is, you're hungry, let's stop.

451
00:20:44,707 --> 00:20:47,420
That's the explanation
I'm looking for, right?

452
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,253
Is that it?

453
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,770
I see by the captain's log
that we'll be checking in,

454
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:56,510
we'll be getting to the
hotel long before dark.

455
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,030
Check-in and we're going to eat, okay?

456
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,380
You can't wait until then?

457
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,580
Crawl in the back and
have a fucking banana.

458
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,573
Nice hotel.

459
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,980
- Hello?

460
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,813
- [Mickey] How are you?

461
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:19,710
- Good, how you doing?

462
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,900
- Dr. Sally Kelly.

463
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,733
- Okay.

464
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,080
- Sir, you're in the wrong hotel.

465
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,870
This is the Stilton, you're
looking for this Stilton Suites.

466
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,130
This happens all the time.

467
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:29,963
- Oh, does it?

468
00:21:29,963 --> 00:21:31,150
- And it says a convention town.

469
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,550
- You got suites?

470
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,180
- Yeah, we do, we have suites here.

471
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,060
- Stilton, right?

472
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,180
- Correct.

473
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,524
- Hey look, you guys
been pulling this crap

474
00:21:37,524 --> 00:21:38,640
for thousands of years.

475
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,730
Give me the rooms and
stop screwing around.

476
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,790
- Sir, we're fully booked.

477
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,260
This is a convention town.

478
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,800
- So what?

479
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,550
- I want to help you out though.

480
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,273
- You see what I got over my shoulder?

481
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,043
Okay?

482
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,003
Get on the fucking phone right
now and get me two rooms.

483
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,263
I made a mistake.

484
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:01,497
I'm not Superman, okay?

485
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:02,748
- [Sally] Oh, I know you're not,

486
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:03,740
but do you have to prove it?

487
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,160
What was so difficult

488
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,100
about reserving a room in a real hotel?

489
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,960
- It wasn't difficult, I
fucked it up really easily.

490
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,410
It's not my field.

491
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,963
- Do you see that teepee?

492
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,960
- You see that vacancy sign, huh?

493
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,190
What can I tell you, Sally?

494
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,053
This is a convention
town, I'm checking us in.

495
00:22:33,738 --> 00:22:36,254
(knocking)

496
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,360
- Yes, come inside.

497
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,960
Just open the door, come inside.

498
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,663
- Hey.

499
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:44,496
- Hi.

500
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,550
- Yeah, you got a phone call
from, from the hotel, right?

501
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,880
The guy coming over with the
broad in the wheelchair, right?

502
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,530
So give me two rooms, right?

503
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,910
- Okay, so I got only one room.

504
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,830
- What are you talking about?

505
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,820
Didn't you tell him you had two rooms?

506
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,130
- Yeah, before I told,
when he did call me,

507
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,900
I told him I got two rooms,

508
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,910
but when you come down all you
had before, I rent the room.

509
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:05,982
- What the fuck is that?

510
00:23:05,982 --> 00:23:07,062
- This American business.

511
00:23:07,062 --> 00:23:07,895
- What?

512
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:08,728
- This American business.

513
00:23:08,728 --> 00:23:10,336
- American business?

514
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,500
This is American business?

515
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,553
- Yeah, who come first, we
do the business, that's it.

516
00:23:15,616 --> 00:23:16,720
- The fuck?

517
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,670
How many rooms you got?

518
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,470
- Okay, you how many people, sir?

519
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,040
- There are three, there are three people,

520
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,597
there's the girl, the nurse,
then there's me, two rooms.

521
00:23:24,597 --> 00:23:25,770
Now you're talking.

522
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,240
- Okay, I get right the one room,

523
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,650
you can stay in the one
room, I don't mind, sir.

524
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,513
- I mind,

525
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:34,090
I don't want to stay in
the fucking room with them.

526
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,417
Give me two rooms.

527
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:37,483
- No, I got only one room, sir.

528
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,890
Please don't do like that, please.

529
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,000
- Let's go, how much?

530
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,540
- This is just unbelievable.

531
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,650
- I'd believe it if I were you.

532
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,040
- Oh great, there's even a step.

533
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,873
- There is not.

534
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,720
See, what are you talking about?

535
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,950
Hey so listen, if you get
into trouble or anything,

536
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,150
send me up a smoke signal.

537
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:00,983
- How?

538
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:01,816
- How the fuck the should I know?

539
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:03,223
Matches or something, okay?

540
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,540
Am I fired?

541
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,373
- Not yet.

542
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,420
- Goodnight Sally.

543
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,363
Goodnight Sally.

544
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,740
I'm not going anywhere
until the door closes.

545
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,390
I'm going to hear the lock, okay?

546
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,125
(knocking)

547
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,940
(knocking)

548
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,773
- Francis.

549
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,327
Who is it?

550
00:24:37,327 --> 00:24:39,443
- [Man] Security, homeland security.

551
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,990
There's somebody in your car.

552
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,870
- Mickey, will you knock it off?

553
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,630
Are you out of your mind?

554
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,303
- [Man] Ma'am, there's
somebody in your car.

555
00:24:49,303 --> 00:24:51,415
- What's he look like?

556
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:52,726
What's he look like?

557
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:55,020
What's he look like?

558
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,623
- He's curled up in a ball,
he's got wild, crazy curly hair.

559
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,910
- It's okay, we know him,

560
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,980
he's just looking after some
equipment, thanks, good night.

561
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,460
- What do you want me to do?

562
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,960
- Scram, would ya?

563
00:25:14,193 --> 00:25:15,733
- Hey, how'd you sleep?

564
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,313
Great hotel, right?

565
00:25:18,313 --> 00:25:19,520
Just like the Stilton.

566
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,577
- How would you know?

567
00:25:20,577 --> 00:25:21,410
- What do you mean, how would I know?

568
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,703
I slept here last night.

569
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,230
Hey uh, my shower is so fucked up.

570
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,333
I, I need to take a, you know,
I'm gonna use your shower.

571
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,402
- No, no, listen, there's a lot of stuff.

572
00:25:30,402 --> 00:25:32,240
It's messy in there,
there's a lot of stuff.

573
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,077
No, go, go, go shower
somewhere else, okay Mickey?

574
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:36,760
- Your hair looks good.

575
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,960
I grew up with five sisters,

576
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,370
what the fuck you
worried about, all right?

577
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,277
I've seen it all.

578
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:10,256
(water running)

579
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,693
(subtle piano music)

580
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,340
Good picture, you're not too bad looking.

581
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,470
Can I go now?

582
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,130
- Sure you can find your way back?

583
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,230
- I'll put it on the top of my to do list.

584
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,893
- Hi.

585
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,210
Who can I make this out to?

586
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,173
Okay Jason.

587
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,690
See you at the lecture tonight?

588
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,300
- [Comedian] That was a very
touching movie, wasn't it?

589
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,280
I had one question about that movie.

590
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,594
How did he wipe his butt
when he did number two?

591
00:27:02,594 --> 00:27:04,570
I was like.

592
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,580
- Can I get you something?

593
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,620
- Yeah, you know any jokes

594
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,710
that nobody's heard in the
whole world that are funny?

595
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,573
- Tons.

596
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,450
- Who should I make this out to?

597
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,953
- To Billy, please.

598
00:27:14,953 --> 00:27:16,440
- Okay, Billy.

599
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,070
Well, I hope I get to see
you at the lecture tonight.

600
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,680
- Oh, I'm Ernie..

601
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,570
Billy's my wife's name, she'll be there.

602
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,500
I got her a telescope for our anniversary

603
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,630
on account of her interest in your book.

604
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,400
- Well, did you read it?

605
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,350
- I tried to, but I didn't understand it.

606
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,880
My wife tried to explain it to me,

607
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,830
but I don't think she
really gets it either,

608
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,710
but I looked through the telescope.

609
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,760
- Come here a second.

610
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,639
- Well the voice of Mr. Bill came from.

611
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:45,222
Oh no, not my back.

612
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:49,240
Hey, hey look, you've been a great crowd.

613
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,193
You haven't been a great
crowd, but thank you anyway.

614
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,035
- Okay, who's next?

615
00:27:57,035 --> 00:28:00,220
From Los Angeles, dude,

616
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,763
the comic stylings of Mickey Schwinn.

617
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:05,013
(applause)

618
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,340
- Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

619
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,740
How you doing tonight, okay?

620
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,998
Anybody over here have any
acupuncture done on them?

621
00:28:12,998 --> 00:28:14,010
- Yeah.

622
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:14,843
- [Mickey] You have, dear?

623
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:15,870
Worked out for you okay?

624
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,470
Yeah, it did okay for me too but you know,

625
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,900
I'm waiting to get dressed,
they got me alone in the room.

626
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,860
I'm looking at the packs of
needles and take it home,

627
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,210
trying to, gonna try some
cat-a-puncture, okay?

628
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,043
Three minutes later,

629
00:28:27,043 --> 00:28:28,580
the cat's running around
with needles out of his head

630
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,943
and his ass, screaming his head off.

631
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:32,470
Didn't work out for him too
good and as a matter of fact,

632
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,630
I don't think any of the
pets I've ever had in my life

633
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,130
have ever appreciated what
I tried to do for them.

634
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,283
Chris Reeve.

635
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,020
- In human experience,

636
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,000
this is called the glue
that keeps people together,

637
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,030
that allows them to grow
as individuals for love.

638
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,430
- Where there's an ambulance
at the finish line.

639
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,100
Where are you going?

640
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,463
Okay, yeah, drag her,
just drag her out, okay?

641
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,280
Uh, had a breakthrough
the other day at analysis.

642
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,820
- So you don't need a telescope,

643
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,973
all you have to do is look at your wife.

644
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:08,973
- Oh.

645
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,963
- How many people
understood what I just said?

646
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,433
Okay, picture this.

647
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,850
- That um, that Chris Reeve joke,

648
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,693
I, I'm a little embarrassed
to say, but I laughed.

649
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,760
- No, I know somebody in a wheelchair,

650
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,960
they're paralyzed from the
waist down, can't move at all.

651
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,860
I guarantee you that they would
laugh too, I guarantee it.

652
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,290
- Two people fall for each other

653
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,880
and there's an explosion of feelings.

654
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,110
This energy can act to
repel the two people

655
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,220
and also attract them.

656
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,110
- So, what do you, what
do you do for laughs?

657
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,880
- Well, right now I'm driving
this scientist around,

658
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,607
this doctor, a book
tour, taking care of her.

659
00:30:11,607 --> 00:30:13,815
You know, maybe you saw
us on TV the other night.

660
00:30:13,815 --> 00:30:14,967
- Who?

661
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:17,270
- The broad I'm talking
about in a wheelchair.

662
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,410
Now she's really high end,

663
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,670
you know, the one that looks like a model,

664
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,710
except like a model sitting
down all the time, right?

665
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,330
She's got beauty, brains, class,
little tough to deal with,

666
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:28,403
but she's really, really unbelievable.

667
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,360
She's going to pay for this.

668
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,263
- No she isn't.

669
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,750
- [Sally] Mickey, would you
stay in the lane, please?

670
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,540
I mean, you're drifting
over to the side, come on,

671
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,120
and use your indicator when
you change, that's the law.

672
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,360
- Hey Sally, you ever planning to drive?

673
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,229
No?

674
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:46,680
'Cause I'd really like
to get in the back seat

675
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,900
with a note pad and take some lessons.

676
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,110
- Yeah, well you could use some lessons.

677
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,460
- Really?

678
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,293
Why don't you drive anyway?

679
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:56,003
Yeah, you got cars with
buttons and all of that shit,

680
00:30:56,003 --> 00:30:57,410
that could outfit you.

681
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,200
What are you going to do
if I have a heart attack

682
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,460
and I got to go to the hospital?

683
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,620
What are you going to do?

684
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,453
- Nothing.

685
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,833
(upbeat music)

686
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,764
- [Mickey] Stop sign.

687
00:31:10,764 --> 00:31:12,640
(laughter)

688
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,589
Watch the road.

689
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:14,590
- Okay, I'm watching the road.

690
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,020
- Are you watching the road?

691
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,640
- Are my, are my feet on the pedals?

692
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,988
- Yeah.

693
00:31:18,988 --> 00:31:20,940
Wanna go back and fool
around a little bit?

694
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,397
Look that, watch the road.

695
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:27,499
- [Sally] It'll be okay.

696
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:29,332
- [Francis] I hope so.

697
00:31:42,187 --> 00:31:43,483
- What'd I do now?

698
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,740
- I have to go home.

699
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,160
- So?

700
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,640
- So it's not all about you.

701
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,223
- You ever read Freud?

702
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,740
What?

703
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,333
- She's going, we're staying.

704
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,650
- You move around a lot?

705
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,130
- Yes, when I'm not at the hospital,

706
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,057
- Well, when you're at the hospital,

707
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,668
you got an answering machine, right?

708
00:32:06,668 --> 00:32:07,501
- Yes.

709
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:08,334
- You're gonna check it?

710
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:09,720
- Sure.

711
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,370
- How could somebody have
four strokes in four years?

712
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:14,147
- I don't know.

713
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,846
- Hey, look at the bright side, all right?

714
00:32:17,846 --> 00:32:19,580
He's probably good for
another four or five,

715
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,111
before it gets serious.

716
00:32:21,111 --> 00:32:23,842
- Can we not talk about this?

717
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:25,280
- [Mickey] Hey, aren't you
gonna be in the way back home?

718
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,573
- [Francis] No.

719
00:32:26,573 --> 00:32:28,003
- [Mickey] 'Cause I could
turn around right now.

720
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,150
She gave you a beeper, right?

721
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,479
- No, I don't have a beeper.

722
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,560
- She didn't give you a fucking beeper?

723
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,620
- Are you afraid?

724
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,735
- Yes.

725
00:32:48,735 --> 00:32:51,444
- Mickey, she'll tell
you what she needs, okay?

726
00:32:51,444 --> 00:32:52,740
And look it, you can't do this,

727
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,710
I'll see you later, Sally, anymore.

728
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,280
You have to stay with
her, she can't be alone.

729
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,413
I do things for her, you
know, private things.

730
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:00,917
- Yes.

731
00:33:00,917 --> 00:33:02,420
- She could do them on
her own, but she doesn't.

732
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,830
- Why?

733
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,747
Why?

734
00:33:04,747 --> 00:33:05,580
- Because I don't know, she's.

735
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,897
- Spoiled, right?

736
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:14,200
Shit.

737
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,653
(knocking)

738
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:21,553
- [Sally] Come in.

739
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,303
- [Mickey] Hi.

740
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:25,136
- Hey.

741
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,873
- I'm going out for about an hour or so.

742
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,060
You catching up on some reading?

743
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,460
- [Sally] Um, I don't have
any work to do tonight.

744
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,880
I'm taking the night off.

745
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,080
- [Mickey] Tired, right?

746
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,200
- [Sally] No, not really.

747
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:41,767
- You want anything before I go?

748
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:42,653
- No, I'm fine.

749
00:33:44,092 --> 00:33:46,570
- And this place is gonna
be so filled with smoke.

750
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,329
- Yeah well, I'm in a wheelchair,
I don't have emphysema.

751
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:51,470
- Well, you can't have that too?

752
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,693
- Yeah, but I don't.

753
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,630
- Sally, you get in front
of your audience, right?

754
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,120
And you got to try to
explain to them, you know,

755
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,620
make them understand, right?

756
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,453
- Yeah.

757
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:02,286
- [Mickey] Right?

758
00:34:02,286 --> 00:34:03,440
What do you do after that?

759
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,273
- What do you mean?

760
00:34:04,273 --> 00:34:05,250
- You don't go anywhere after that?

761
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,200
That's it, right?

762
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,033
- [Sally] Right.

763
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:08,270
- I got to make these guys like me,

764
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,640
I got to make them understand,
I got to make them laugh

765
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,067
and if I, if they don't laugh,
I look like an idiot, right?

766
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:14,050
All right?

767
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:14,883
You're at a lecture

768
00:34:14,883 --> 00:34:16,550
and they don't understand
what you're saying,

769
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,280
they look like idiots, right?

770
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,113
- Right.

771
00:34:20,113 --> 00:34:20,946
- Do you see what I'm saying?

772
00:34:20,946 --> 00:34:22,200
- I see what you're saying.

773
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,280
- There'll be a lot of guys on before me.

774
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,690
- I don't mind.

775
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,997
- [Mickey] Some of them
might not be that funny.

776
00:34:26,997 --> 00:34:28,073
- That's okay.

777
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,097
- I might be one of them.

778
00:34:31,097 --> 00:34:33,570
- But you told me that you were funny.

779
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,683
- Don't hold me to it.

780
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,470
- Whoa, so you were bullshitting me?

781
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,303
- I was lying.

782
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,430
- Wow, you're getting good.

783
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,790
- Thank you.

784
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,623
That means a lot coming from you.

785
00:35:09,623 --> 00:35:12,330
- Well, you could have
parked in the handicap area,

786
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,163
you know?

787
00:35:13,163 --> 00:35:14,120
- If it's all the same to you,

788
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,240
I kind of prefer to save those spaces

789
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,230
for people who have to
crawl in to get there,

790
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,300
or the guys who park
in the handicap spaces

791
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,060
at the golf course and play 18 holes

792
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,720
and break their clubs over their knees,

793
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,770
or people who have too
much jewelry, 80 years old,

794
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,870
they can't make it, the
oxygen's too long to walk.

795
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,120
You being handicapped?

796
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,850
Come on, get the fuck out
of there, I want to go in.

797
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,450
- All right, let's see the show.

798
00:35:35,351 --> 00:35:38,601
(subtle country music)

799
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,060
- Hi.

800
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,850
Where's the sign up sheet?

801
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,440
- For what?

802
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,440
- Amateur night tonight, open mic night.

803
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,100
- So what's your name?

804
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,893
- Mickey Schwinn, like the bicycle.

805
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,380
- Like what?

806
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,213
- The bicycle.

807
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,543
- Schwinn.

808
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,650
I'll uh, I'll call you when you're on.

809
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,483
- Okay.

810
00:36:24,512 --> 00:36:27,762
(subtle country music)

811
00:36:30,784 --> 00:36:31,800
- Can I buy you a drink?

812
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,373
- Yeah, sure partner.

813
00:36:36,393 --> 00:36:37,226
- Yeah?

814
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:38,059
- Yeah, to the road.

815
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:38,903
- To the road.

816
00:36:39,953 --> 00:36:41,580
- Are you okay?

817
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,810
- Yeah, sure.

818
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,643
- You sure?

819
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,840
- Yeah, are you okay?

820
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,963
- Yeah, yeah.

821
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,951
What did you say?

822
00:36:53,951 --> 00:36:56,053
- I didn't say anything.

823
00:36:56,053 --> 00:36:59,303
(subtle country music)

824
00:37:03,123 --> 00:37:05,956
- One more time for Big Jim Benny.

825
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,830
- Thank you very much.

826
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:12,750
- Now the Cowboy Palace
announces Mickey Schwinn.

827
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,000
(applause)

828
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,810
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

829
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,080
or howdy, whatever you
say in dry gold chair.

830
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,920
I had a horse once,

831
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,870
but he ran out of matches and
rolling paper, so I shot him.

832
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,750
Let me ask you something, just
to get acquainted, all right?

833
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,320
Just to get to know each other,

834
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,720
how many guys out here
have ever had a blow job?

835
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,283
- Why, are you gay?

836
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,093
- No, but I can be, if you want.

837
00:37:45,093 --> 00:37:46,520
I'm you know, flexible,

838
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,020
you know what I mean, partner?

839
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,920
So my girlfriend says to me the other day,

840
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,840
she says, hey, you know,

841
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,840
you're not spending
enough time on foreplay.

842
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,673
I asked her, I said,

843
00:37:57,673 --> 00:37:59,790
what do you think six
months of stalking you was?

844
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,500
- Well, she's a whore.

845
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,910
- She's a what?

846
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:03,800
- [Man] She's a whore.

847
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,858
- That's right, I thought
you'd said something else.

848
00:38:06,858 --> 00:38:10,110
A lot of my friends are, you
know, divorce casualties.

849
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,360
A lot of money goes into these lawyers.

850
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,980
We got something different
out in California

851
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,280
with doing our own lawyering,

852
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,270
with taking care of our
own divorce, a lot cheaper,

853
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,150
goes something like this,

854
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,000
maybe you guys could learn something.

855
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,430
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, state of California,

856
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,263
your honor,

857
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:26,480
I'll be representing myself
in this divorce proceeding.

858
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,160
If you will turn to article
four, section B, exhibit A,

859
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,970
it clearly states, my
wife is a fucking cunt.

860
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,243
I'm resting my case.

861
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:39,060
- Maybe you should have
got yourself a Jew lawyer.

862
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,323
- A Jew, I did get a
Joe lawyer, no he was a.

863
00:38:41,323 --> 00:38:42,910
- A Jew lawyer.

864
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,890
- [Mickey] I did, I got a Joe lawyer,

865
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,800
Joe White, a big fucking dumb white guy.

866
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,750
Maybe you know him.

867
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,953
No?

868
00:38:51,953 --> 00:38:53,930
Anyway, I'm in an S and M
bar once and uh, you know,

869
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:57,290
I'm working on this broad,
that's a cowgirl to you guys,

870
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,030
and I'm working on her, I get her home

871
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,940
and I'm going through the, you know,

872
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,160
get your ass up in the air

873
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,250
and pay tribute to your master routine

874
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,830
and she turns to me
and she goes, you know,

875
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,410
I don't like being spoken to like that.

876
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,700
I go, where did you come from, baby?

877
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,933
What chatroom did you wander into?

878
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:11,600
This an S and M bar.

879
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,650
- This is bullshit, man.

880
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,390
- Give me a chance to show you

881
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,970
my heart's in the right place, okay?

882
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:24,620
I don't want you to think ill of me

883
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,500
when I leave here and go down yonder.

884
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,980
Let me dedicate a joke to
your home state, all right?

885
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,380
And then hopefully you'll,

886
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,490
you'll take it in the
spirit of which it's given.

887
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,870
Where are you from, what's
your home state, sir?

888
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,290
- Alabama.

889
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,997
- Crimson Tide.

890
00:39:38,997 --> 00:39:40,298
- That's right.

891
00:39:40,298 --> 00:39:41,548
- That's great.

892
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,070
For Alabama, is this
guy your second cousin,

893
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,340
or did you fuck him three times already?

894
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,140
Hey you know, I could see by
the horse tail on the wall,

895
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,197
that my time is up

896
00:39:51,197 --> 00:39:55,040
and I'm so tired from busting
sod and everything like that

897
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,730
and then Victoria Barkley is coming over

898
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,853
and uh, happy tails.

899
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,633
Put it down, show's over.

900
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,300
Show's over, let's go.

901
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,710
- Come on, you were great,
I want to celebrate.

902
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,003
- Don't do this to me.

903
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:11,823
Come on.

904
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:15,943
- Oops.

905
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:20,150
- Honey, you're scaring
me, this is terrible.

906
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,410
You okay?

907
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,560
- Listen guys,

908
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,350
he's got a lot of things to
do this next couple of days,

909
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,860
basically take care of me,

910
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,070
so if you please just don't beat him up.

911
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,180
I'll send him back to you, okay?

912
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,863
- You're going to hide behind
a little girl in a wheelchair?

913
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:36,803
- Yeah, I am.

914
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:39,499
Come on.

915
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,060
- Hey, watch this.

916
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,673
Hey there Pilgrim.

917
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,760
- [Mickey] Bed-y bye time.

918
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:58,952
Oh God.

919
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,340
- Ask them, go on.

920
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,403
Go on, ask them.

921
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,110
- She wants to know, with all due respect,

922
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,710
if you thought anything was
funny, any of the jokes.

923
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,320
- Ask them if they got it.

924
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,443
Ask them if they got it.

925
00:41:15,443 --> 00:41:17,374
- Come on, come on, let's go.

926
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,494
Okay?

927
00:41:18,494 --> 00:41:19,327
All right?

928
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,290
It's not going to happen again, okay?

929
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,540
I assure you, okay?

930
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,373
This is it.

931
00:41:27,222 --> 00:41:28,872
You're not ready, you're not up to this.

932
00:41:28,872 --> 00:41:31,072
It's nothing to be
ashamed of, get in there.

933
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,660
- Come on, let's get out of here.

934
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:42,933
- Okay.

935
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,060
- Look, you might want to
uh, check that rear tire,

936
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,160
it looks a little low.

937
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,850
- Thanks partner.

938
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,350
Hey, you know, I'm really sorry

939
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,220
the horse didn't rape
me in the parking lot

940
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,560
because I know how much you
would have enjoyed that.

941
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,690
I'll do better next time.

942
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,560
I'll try to be more attractive.

943
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,483
- Squeal, squeal.

944
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:14,260
- Let me tell you something, all right?

945
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,570
The push came to shove.

946
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:18,740
I can take care of myself and
you in a situation like that.

947
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,320
- You couldn't punch
your way out of a bank.

948
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,470
Come on, Mickey, admit it.

949
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,523
- Paper or plastic?

950
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,150
- I haven't laughed so much in years.

951
00:42:33,139 --> 00:42:36,389
(subtle Spanish music)

952
00:42:43,357 --> 00:42:46,607
(subtle Spanish music)

953
00:43:02,216 --> 00:43:05,466
(upbeat Spanish music)

954
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:17,911
(upbeat Spanish music)

955
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,610
- Oh my God, Mickey.

956
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:50,143
I can walk, I'm cured.

957
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:57,803
Oh yeah, I can't walk, but I can cum.

958
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,453
- You came?

959
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,113
You okay?

960
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,010
- Yeah, are you okay?

961
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,150
- Yeah, a little different, but.

962
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:12,250
- [Sally] It was a little
different for me too.

963
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,230
Never done it before

964
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,220
with a guy who didn't have
his high school diploma.

965
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,913
- Equivalency and I don't
have that either, okay?

966
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,330
- Now what do we do?

967
00:44:29,138 --> 00:44:32,529
- Okay, do you uh, try this out, okay?

968
00:44:32,529 --> 00:44:33,362
- What?

969
00:44:33,362 --> 00:44:37,140
- This uh, uh, I got into
trouble the other day with my,

970
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,093
one of my friends.

971
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,230
- What, what happened?

972
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:44,120
- He asked me to take his
kids to the petting zoo.

973
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,850
It started raining and it got cold

974
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:46,890
and I lost the directions,

975
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,120
so I took them to the supermarket.

976
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,950
You know, hey, you want to pet the cow?

977
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,513
It's ground beef or a filet.

978
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,470
Wanna see the chickens?

979
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:57,740
They're eight pieces or four pieces.

980
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,890
He gets really pissed off

981
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:02,470
and what does scarred
for life mean anyway?

982
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:05,430
You know what I'm saying?

983
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:06,723
- Are you a musician?

984
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,763
- No I'm, I'm the guy inside Barney.

985
00:45:12,955 --> 00:45:15,240
- You weren't the guy inside Barney.

986
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,670
- What makes you say that?

987
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,950
- Well even though he's inside of Barney

988
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,270
and you can't see him,

989
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:22,820
he still would have to be
better looking than you.

990
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,653
Ha ha.

991
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,690
- Nice way to talk, kid.

992
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:28,543
That's lovely.

993
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,219
Hey sweetie.

994
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:33,052
- What?

995
00:45:33,052 --> 00:45:34,670
- I think you took a leak.

996
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:36,004
- Get me to the room.

997
00:45:36,004 --> 00:45:36,880
- What's the magic word?

998
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,713
- Get me to the room!

999
00:45:37,713 --> 00:45:38,680
- Okay.

1000
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,260
Sally, for what it's worth, they,

1001
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,290
I used to know a guy at the
country club, Mr. Schwartz,

1002
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:46,010
and the lifeguard was
pulling him over constantly,

1003
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,040
saying look,

1004
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,830
we're getting complaints that
you're peeing in the pool

1005
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:52,230
and Mr. Schwartz would say,
everybody pees in the pool

1006
00:45:53,894 --> 00:45:56,623
and the lifeguard goes, but
not from the high diving board.

1007
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:00,483
It's no big deal.

1008
00:46:03,968 --> 00:46:04,968
Want to go shopping?

1009
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,130
- Oh hold on, this is nice.

1010
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:13,923
It's a nice color.

1011
00:46:13,923 --> 00:46:15,480
What do you think?

1012
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,313
- Try it on.

1013
00:46:17,807 --> 00:46:19,963
- I'm not going to make
it in the dressing room.

1014
00:46:24,062 --> 00:46:26,097
- Just put it on here.

1015
00:46:26,097 --> 00:46:26,930
- Here?

1016
00:46:28,123 --> 00:46:30,706
(subtle music)

1017
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,130
- How's business?

1018
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,180
- Yeah I mean, it's the
woman behind the scenes,

1019
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,650
the one behind the book, the woman.

1020
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,200
- What else do they want to know?

1021
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,200
- Well, personal things.

1022
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,033
- Yeah, like what?

1023
00:46:55,033 --> 00:46:55,866
- I don't know.

1024
00:46:55,866 --> 00:46:56,972
- Like who your lover is?

1025
00:46:56,972 --> 00:46:57,805
- Maybe.

1026
00:46:57,805 --> 00:46:58,638
- You're ashamed.

1027
00:46:58,638 --> 00:46:59,471
- No, I'm not.

1028
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:01,260
- You're ashamed, I'm like
your Back Street girl.

1029
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,390
The fireplace.

1030
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:04,640
- Yeah, you like this?

1031
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,890
- [Mickey] Roosevelt, fireside chat.

1032
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,320
- [Sally] Eleanor or Franklin?

1033
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,393
- Both presidential.

1034
00:47:09,648 --> 00:47:10,883
How's the mustache today?

1035
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:14,563
Hi.

1036
00:47:14,563 --> 00:47:15,760
- Hi, is this Dr. Kelly's room?

1037
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,778
- That's her.

1038
00:47:16,778 --> 00:47:17,611
- Hi.

1039
00:47:17,611 --> 00:47:18,444
- Hi.

1040
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:19,277
- I'm Donna.

1041
00:47:19,277 --> 00:47:20,653
- Hi I'm Laurie, we're
here for the interview.

1042
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,990
- Hello, I'm Lucy and I'm
going to be doing your makeup.

1043
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:25,880
- [Sally] How do you do?

1044
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,010
- Do you mind?

1045
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,460
- [Sally] No, no, not at all.

1046
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:31,680
- How's it going?

1047
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,913
- [Lucy] That is so wrong.

1048
00:47:37,311 --> 00:47:38,954
Do you have a black turtleneck?

1049
00:47:38,954 --> 00:47:41,400
- Uh yeah, I have a black turtleneck.

1050
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,680
- That's great.

1051
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,290
Can you put it on?

1052
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,123
- Uh, sure.

1053
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,433
Excuse me.

1054
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:48,266
- Oh.

1055
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:52,920
- Sally, I'm gonna take off, okay?

1056
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,930
- Okay, see ya.

1057
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,093
- All right, bye.

1058
00:47:55,093 --> 00:47:55,926
- Bye.

1059
00:47:55,926 --> 00:47:56,890
- Have fun.

1060
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:59,880
- 12 to 17, all the sex
questions are out, right?

1061
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,514
- Right.

1062
00:48:01,514 --> 00:48:03,180
You can load up on the space stuff.

1063
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,430
- No, that looks fantastic
in front of there.

1064
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:08,400
Okay, here we go.

1065
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,600
All right.

1066
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,130
Now, is there anything you
want to start off with,

1067
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:14,410
Dr. Kelly?

1068
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,903
- Yeah, let's talk about sex.

1069
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,003
- Aren't you the guy

1070
00:48:24,003 --> 00:48:26,550
that checked in with that
girl in the wheelchair?

1071
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,050
- What did she do?

1072
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,900
- Nothing, nothing, but
I've been there, pal.

1073
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,173
My wife had a disability.

1074
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,583
You guys got it made now,
it's a whole new deal.

1075
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,280
- What are you talking about?

1076
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,280
- Electric, they want something,
they get it just like that.

1077
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,241
Would have made my life
a hell of a lot easier.

1078
00:48:48,241 --> 00:48:49,074
- Is that right?

1079
00:48:49,074 --> 00:48:49,907
- Yeah.

1080
00:48:49,907 --> 00:48:50,940
You mind if I sit down?

1081
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:51,833
- No, go ahead.

1082
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,420
My name's Ken Sherry.

1083
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,253
What's yours?

1084
00:48:57,253 --> 00:49:00,020
- Uh, Mickey Schwinn.

1085
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,950
- What's wrong with her?

1086
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:04,175
- Well you know, be honest with you,

1087
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:05,883
she's got a really big fucking mouth.

1088
00:49:05,883 --> 00:49:08,100
- No, no, no, I mean the disability.

1089
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,513
- Oh well, you know, Mr. Sherry,

1090
00:49:10,513 --> 00:49:12,840
you see her in the wheelchair, right?

1091
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,640
That's all you need to know.

1092
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,490
- Yeah, we were always one
operation away from something.

1093
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:19,550
What are you doing here?

1094
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,240
- Oh, she's a scientist, she
wrote a book, she's pushing it,

1095
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,990
helping her out, you know,
we're on the trail together.

1096
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,800
- Didn't I see her on one
of those telethons at Easter

1097
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,050
with Jerry?

1098
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:36,160
- Oh, you know, you're
thinking of Jerry's kids,

1099
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,040
well Sally's kids, whole
different operation.

1100
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,843
Completely different franchise.

1101
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:44,350
I gotta take a piss.

1102
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,290
- Uh, excuse me, you're
coming back, aren't you?

1103
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:48,510
- What, you want to talk some more?

1104
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:49,450
- [Ken] Yeah.

1105
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,215
- I'll come back then.

1106
00:49:51,215 --> 00:49:53,820
- You wouldn't bullshit me, would you?

1107
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,370
- Mr. Sherry, the bullshit
starts when I come back.

1108
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,383
Sally's kids.

1109
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,455
I don't know my own strength.

1110
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,433
S-H-E-R-R-Y.

1111
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,742
- No sir, we do not, I'm sorry.

1112
00:50:15,742 --> 00:50:18,825
(subtle piano music)

1113
00:50:34,766 --> 00:50:36,183
- Mickey, Mickey,

1114
00:50:38,215 --> 00:50:39,765
I've got to go to the bathroom.

1115
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:42,973
- Go to the bathroom.

1116
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,317
(thunder crashing)

1117
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:49,933
That's my girl.

1118
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,650
(upbeat music)

1119
00:52:05,485 --> 00:52:07,820
- Ah, thank you very much.

1120
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,440
See you.

1121
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,273
Hi.

1122
00:52:10,273 --> 00:52:11,106
- [Betty] Hello.

1123
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:16,360
Honey, you know, you're so
much prettier in person.

1124
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,660
- That's very sweet of you to say.

1125
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:19,710
Who should I make this out to?

1126
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:21,993
- [Betty] Oh, to Betty Parker please.

1127
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,610
No, no, no, just make that Betty.

1128
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:26,660
- [Sally] Okay Betty.

1129
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:31,080
- [Betty] So how long are
you going to be in town?

1130
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,570
- Oh, we're leaving tomorrow.

1131
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:35,060
- [Betty] Oh, that's such a shame.

1132
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,770
You know, I have a nephew
that works here at the college

1133
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:41,610
and he's planning on being
at your lecture this evening

1134
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:44,180
and I just have this feeling,

1135
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,950
the two of you would
be wonderful together.

1136
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:47,802
- [Sally] Oh, you do?

1137
00:52:47,802 --> 00:52:48,690
- Yes.

1138
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:49,860
- [Sally] Is he a professor?

1139
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:53,397
- [Betty] No, but I do have
his picture in here some place.

1140
00:52:53,397 --> 00:52:54,870
Where is that?

1141
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:55,973
Here it is.

1142
00:52:57,410 --> 00:52:59,633
See, he's in a wheelchair.

1143
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,670
- I'll take it from here, just.

1144
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:03,779
- Take what from here?

1145
00:53:03,779 --> 00:53:04,612
- Just go.

1146
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:07,290
- I don't even want to
know what I did this time.

1147
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:08,123
- Get away.

1148
00:53:08,123 --> 00:53:09,060
- But you know what?

1149
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:09,893
You take it.

1150
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:11,823
- Be back in an hour.

1151
00:53:11,823 --> 00:53:12,656
- Take it.

1152
00:53:13,508 --> 00:53:16,091
(upbeat music)

1153
00:53:25,339 --> 00:53:26,339
- Thank you.

1154
00:53:28,251 --> 00:53:30,834
(upbeat music)

1155
00:53:42,573 --> 00:53:43,923
- Are you ready, Dr. Kelly?

1156
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:47,310
- So in human experience,

1157
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:51,020
this is called the glue
that keeps people together,

1158
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:51,900
yeah right.

1159
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:52,733
Um,

1160
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:58,810
um, in, in the planets, in
the galaxy between planets,

1161
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:03,950
this is called Turner's
so-called funny energy of matter,

1162
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,113
or the dark force.

1163
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:12,420
So at this time, if anybody
would have any questions,

1164
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,883
I'd be happy to answer them.

1165
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:16,790
Yes sir.

1166
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:19,300
- [Malcolm] Dr. Kelly, Malcolm Roberts,

1167
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,670
Scientific journeyman.

1168
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:21,733
- [Sally] Yes sir.

1169
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:28,580
- [Malcolm] You referred to the
dark force, which I'm sorry,

1170
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:31,890
I just kind of lost you a little bit

1171
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:32,981
when it came around to.

1172
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:35,790
- [Sally] Could you repeat that please?

1173
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:38,470
- When you were speaking
about the dark force,

1174
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:40,660
I kind of lost you there.

1175
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,323
- What, what did you just say?

1176
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:46,170
- I'm sorry, I'll speak up.

1177
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:49,350
The dark force, did
you find that when you?

1178
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,993
- Sir, did you just tell
me to go fuck myself?

1179
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,400
- I beg your pardon?

1180
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,210
- Did you just tell me to go fuck myself?

1181
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,160
- [Malcolm] Am I hearing you correctly?

1182
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,063
You know, lady,

1183
00:55:05,063 --> 00:55:08,750
I think that that glue that
keeps the universe together

1184
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:12,470
is having a hard time
keeping you together.

1185
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:13,303
- [Sally] You know what?

1186
00:55:13,303 --> 00:55:14,503
Go fuck yourself.

1187
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,713
- You okay?

1188
00:55:17,713 --> 00:55:18,816
- Did you just hear that?

1189
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:19,892
- Yeah, I did.

1190
00:55:19,892 --> 00:55:20,725
Are you okay?

1191
00:55:20,725 --> 00:55:21,558
- I'm fine.

1192
00:55:21,558 --> 00:55:22,901
- All right, now I, I think,

1193
00:55:22,901 --> 00:55:25,001
I don't think this is your room, let's go.

1194
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,168
Come on.

1195
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:29,376
- Get out of here.

1196
00:55:29,376 --> 00:55:30,730
No, get rid of the him.

1197
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:32,860
- We're already getting rid
of him, he's gone, let's go.

1198
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:33,693
- Get away.

1199
00:55:33,693 --> 00:55:34,562
- Come on, let's go.

1200
00:55:34,562 --> 00:55:35,395
- Just get away from me, would you?

1201
00:55:35,395 --> 00:55:37,209
- Get your hand over here.

1202
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:38,109
Come on, let's go.

1203
00:55:42,564 --> 00:55:44,314
- Get off me, Mickey!

1204
00:55:46,144 --> 00:55:47,170
Get away!

1205
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,133
Will you stop it?

1206
00:55:49,898 --> 00:55:51,315
Will you stop it?

1207
00:55:52,149 --> 00:55:52,982
Mickey!

1208
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:57,923
Hey Mickey.

1209
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,653
- [Mickey] Hey, how you feeling?

1210
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:03,343
- [Sally] Do you want to go to dinner?

1211
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,630
- Do you remember this afternoon?

1212
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,913
- What am I, a desk?

1213
00:56:08,982 --> 00:56:11,013
- I can't make a fucking phone call?

1214
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,930
- Yes, I remember this afternoon.

1215
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:16,620
- I thought we could talk about that.

1216
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,167
- Yeah, well I don't
want to talk about it.

1217
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:19,753
I want to go out to dinner.

1218
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:23,283
- Well, you know what?

1219
00:56:23,283 --> 00:56:25,210
I think it'd be a good idea

1220
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:27,202
if we like got room
service and stayed in here.

1221
00:56:27,202 --> 00:56:29,443
- No, no, I want to go out to dinner.

1222
00:56:36,834 --> 00:56:39,667
(speaking French)

1223
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,040
- I'm sorry madam, I don't speak French.

1224
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:46,543
- This'll do.

1225
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,850
He doesn't drink.

1226
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:52,683
- Yeah, I do.

1227
00:56:52,683 --> 00:56:53,516
- [Sally] No you don't.

1228
00:56:53,516 --> 00:56:54,349
- Yeah I do.

1229
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:55,182
- [Sally] You're driving.

1230
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:00,510
See anything you like on the menu?

1231
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:01,343
- [Mickey] Well Sally, you know,

1232
00:57:01,343 --> 00:57:04,200
I don't speak French either,
so uh, what do you think?

1233
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,850
French toast, French
fries, French dressing.

1234
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,100
What do you recommend?

1235
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,810
- I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to embarrass you.

1236
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:13,130
- [Mickey] I'm not embarrassed,
I'm just fucking hungry,

1237
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,480
if you'll pardon my French.

1238
00:57:16,589 --> 00:57:18,339
- Do you wanna dance?

1239
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,333
Dance?

1240
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:22,503
- Hey, Sally, what is it with you?

1241
00:57:22,503 --> 00:57:24,520
I got to wheel you around the dance floor

1242
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,353
and we'll hold hands,

1243
00:57:25,353 --> 00:57:27,870
or do I get to hold you
up and drag you around?

1244
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:30,270
I'm tired, I'm hungry, that's it.

1245
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:31,790
- You're lazy.

1246
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:32,623
- That's not true.

1247
00:57:32,623 --> 00:57:33,810
- It is true.

1248
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,530
Every time I want to do something,

1249
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:36,590
you give me this bullshit

1250
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:39,513
about not exerting myself
and to take it easy.

1251
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:43,410
You're like Mr. Shortcut.

1252
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:45,960
- [Mickey] Yeah, you're
like Mrs. Special Olympics.

1253
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,240
Sally, I'm sorry.

1254
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,530
- [Man] Hey Pally.

1255
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:54,460
Cut the little lady some
slack, why don't you?

1256
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,746
- Just suck your dick, why don't you?

1257
00:57:56,746 --> 00:57:58,663
- Oh, good luck.

1258
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,660
- Hey Sally look,

1259
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:04,560
I'm not saying I'm the most
tolerant person on earth, okay?

1260
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,870
I know I got my shortcomings,

1261
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:07,750
but I've also got my long Cummings too

1262
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,860
and it ain't hopping around
from city to city with you.

1263
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,560
I mean, I like it, I like it,

1264
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,620
but you're dropping the ball,
you're losing your focus.

1265
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,540
People are paying to see you.

1266
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,930
They're lining up,
paying, and they walk in.

1267
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:20,900
What do they get?

1268
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,300
Go fuck yourselves?

1269
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,313
What is that?

1270
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:27,000
- Who are you to tell me
that I am dropping the ball

1271
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,180
when you don't even have a ball, okay?

1272
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,420
And what is this about, use it in my act?

1273
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,233
You don't even have an act.

1274
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,900
- Hey Sally, congratulations.

1275
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,453
You just turned into a
first-class bitch on wheels.

1276
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,340
- Well, you know what, Mickey?

1277
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:47,120
I don't see anybody lining
up to see you, okay?

1278
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,040
And paying any money, okay?

1279
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,100
- No, I line up to see them for nothing

1280
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,640
and I give it my fucking heart.

1281
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,660
I don't phone it in like you do.

1282
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,030
What do they get from you, huh?

1283
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:58,160
What are you teaching them?

1284
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,980
What are you doing up there, huh?

1285
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:00,813
What?

1286
00:59:00,813 --> 00:59:02,359
Tell me.

1287
00:59:02,359 --> 00:59:04,942
(upbeat music)

1288
00:59:13,065 --> 00:59:15,648
(upbeat music)

1289
00:59:23,049 --> 00:59:25,632
(upbeat music)

1290
00:59:31,672 --> 00:59:34,255
(upbeat music)

1291
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,530
- No, don't tell me I'm wrong
because I know I'm right.

1292
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:06,160
I'm looking at you and you look exhausted.

1293
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,080
You've been running around
in too many circles.

1294
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,080
You've been partying too much.

1295
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,440
You're not really taking
charge of your life.

1296
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,333
- No, no, I'm fine.

1297
01:00:15,273 --> 01:00:17,400
- Look who dropped by
the Old Cracker Barrel

1298
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,433
to chew the fat.

1299
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,000
- [Dad] Sally,

1300
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,770
you just got fired from
three speaking engagements.

1301
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:25,710
You're not letting anybody
do anything at all for you.

1302
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:27,280
Have I left anything out?

1303
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,113
- No.

1304
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,680
- Sally, have you ever
heard of the expression,

1305
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,450
a blessing in disguise?

1306
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:35,420
I mean, you're here, you're home safe.

1307
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,800
I mean, it's not the end of the world.

1308
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,500
There will be other lectures.

1309
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,870
You need to get back to your work,

1310
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:42,640
which in the end, it's going
to help a lot of people.

1311
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,750
I mean, there's certainly
nothing wrong with.

1312
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,326
- Knowing your limitations,

1313
01:00:46,326 --> 01:00:48,080
is that what you're trying to say?

1314
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:51,200
- [Dad] Sally, I've always
respected your instincts.

1315
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,033
- We're worried.

1316
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:55,970
- But maybe this once, did
you ever consider the fact

1317
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:57,193
that maybe you were on
the road with some guy

1318
01:00:57,193 --> 01:00:59,123
who was just out for a free ride?

1319
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:01,333
- I mean, it couldn't be your fault.

1320
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:04,610
I mean, what kind of person
would take advantage of someone

1321
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:08,160
so, well, so vulnerable?

1322
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,400
- [Dad] What do you think the chances are

1323
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,210
of this guy sticking by
somebody in your condition

1324
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,840
for any period of time?

1325
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,793
- 50/50.

1326
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,500
Let me rephrase what you're trying to say.

1327
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,240
He is not good enough for me

1328
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,190
and I'm not good enough for
anybody, isn't that right?

1329
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:25,580
- Well, that about sums it up for me.

1330
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:26,770
- [Dad] No, it doesn't sum it up for me.

1331
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:29,160
We're talking about my
daughter's life, not a career.

1332
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,460
- But no, the point that she's making

1333
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,107
is the whole thing that
we're talking about here.

1334
01:01:32,107 --> 01:01:32,973
- But no.

1335
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,293
- We fucked.

1336
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,720
I fucking hate him.

1337
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,550
- [Audrey] The man is an idiot.

1338
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:46,850
This isn't the first time.

1339
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,840
You know, he came out with
this color two years ago

1340
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,290
and he called it Ferrari red.

1341
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:56,700
It's the same color and now
he calls it Lamborghini red.

1342
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,500
Like I wouldn't know the difference.

1343
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:01,610
I have to ask you something.

1344
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,530
Should I feel guilty

1345
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:08,340
about putting you and Mickey
together in the first place?

1346
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,173
- It's okay.

1347
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:14,810
- We're so different, Sally.

1348
01:02:15,686 --> 01:02:16,563
- Oh, are we?

1349
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,430
- Well picture this,

1350
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:25,370
you're living in a luxury
penthouse apartment

1351
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:26,920
and you're looking over the balcony

1352
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,170
and you see a moving van.

1353
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:32,113
Now very quickly, are
they moving out or in?

1354
01:02:32,113 --> 01:02:33,270
- In.

1355
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:34,720
- I see them moving out

1356
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,813
and that's a difference
between you and me.

1357
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:43,053
You're the real optimist
and you're really lucky.

1358
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,543
- Okay, picture this,

1359
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,290
you get out of a limo

1360
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:51,230
and you're escorted into
a hot disco gambling

1361
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:54,450
restaurant bar and I'm
rolling along by your side

1362
01:02:55,633 --> 01:02:57,180
and you are looking great

1363
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:00,490
and your walk is all sex
and grace and purpose

1364
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:05,170
and then you see a
combination Marlboro man

1365
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:07,970
and film director walking towards us.

1366
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:11,010
Quickly now, very quickly,
which one does he ask to dance?

1367
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:12,590
Quickly now, you or me?

1368
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:13,490
You walking bitch.

1369
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,133
- He picked you, Sally.

1370
01:04:02,742 --> 01:04:06,610
- [Mickey] Hi Mr. Costello,
you're looking well.

1371
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,970
- I'm not in your way or anything, am I?

1372
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,690
- I'll let you know in about five minutes.

1373
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:12,570
- Oh really?

1374
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:13,776
- Yeah, haven't you ever
heard the expression,

1375
01:04:13,776 --> 01:04:15,943
if you're not 10 minutes
early, you're late?

1376
01:04:18,459 --> 01:04:19,610
You said I wasn't ready.

1377
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:21,160
I went out on the road
and you know something?

1378
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,267
When you're right, you're right

1379
01:04:22,267 --> 01:04:24,930
and I'm going to tell you
something, you were right.

1380
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:25,763
I'm not going to tell you

1381
01:04:25,763 --> 01:04:27,620
they did any newspaper
reports on me out there,

1382
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,183
but I was pretty fucking funny,

1383
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:31,763
sometimes.

1384
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,490
Mr. Costello, what are we doing here?

1385
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:45,040
You buying the Brooklyn bridge?

1386
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:49,993
Give me a spot, any spot.

1387
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:53,750
- Mickey.

1388
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:54,583
- No, you listen.

1389
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:55,450
What am I, what's going to happen

1390
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:56,617
if you put me up there one night, right?

1391
01:04:56,617 --> 01:04:57,610
And I'm not funny.

1392
01:04:57,610 --> 01:04:59,470
Am I going to read about you
in Variety the next morning

1393
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:01,320
that you hung yourself in the garage?

1394
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,353
Am I?

1395
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,170
- No.

1396
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:09,070
- You got the balls to give me a spot.

1397
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:13,843
- Starting two weeks from tonight.

1398
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,663
Thursdays, 2 o'clock.

1399
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:19,993
In the AM.

1400
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,137
That's your spot.

1401
01:05:22,137 --> 01:05:23,853
- I don't know what to say.

1402
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:27,430
- Just try to come up with something, huh?

1403
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:30,727
- Thanks.

1404
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:33,095
You won't regret it, I
won't disappoint you, okay?

1405
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,083
I won't disappoint you, I gotta go.

1406
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:39,563
- Comedians.

1407
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:43,400
- Mr. Costello, I forgot
to tell you something.

1408
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,980
Joe, I'm broke.

1409
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,790
Can I have an advance?

1410
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:48,733
- Sure, no problem.

1411
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:52,630
You just put one foot
in front of the other

1412
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:55,053
and advance yourself the fuck outta here.

1413
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,340
- We got shut down and you
know how that goes, okay?

1414
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:59,173
I don't have any money,

1415
01:05:59,173 --> 01:06:00,950
so as far as your last paycheck goes,

1416
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:02,920
I'm sorry, but we're
going to rebuild, okay?

1417
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,570
Just like they did in Jerusalem.

1418
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:07,350
God is my witness, if they
can rebuild in Jerusalem,

1419
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:09,540
then we can certainly rebuild here, okay?

1420
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,630
And it's not your fault,
it's not my fault.

1421
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:12,570
It's the government's fault

1422
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:14,820
because they're cracking
down on the businessman,

1423
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:17,480
which is what I believe
myself to be, okay?

1424
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,900
And they're taking away from our freedom

1425
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,650
because what is our freedom
without free enterprise, okay?

1426
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:24,220
And as Esau said to Jacob,

1427
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:26,620
I need you back as a closer, okay?

1428
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:29,590
And I've been wrongfully accused
and God have mercy on them

1429
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:31,860
because the Lord does have mercy on those

1430
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:32,810
that wrongfully accuse,

1431
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:36,800
instead of smiting them with
the jaw bone of an ass, okay?

1432
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,930
Now Mickey, I had spoke to
some of your old accounts.

1433
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:41,070
Now I want you back, I need a good closer.

1434
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:43,023
You're the only one I know that can.

1435
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:45,063
- What we'll do is this,

1436
01:06:45,063 --> 01:06:47,500
I'll come in for two weeks
and you will pay me cash.

1437
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:52,500
No business checks, no I owe
you's, no chits, cash, okay?

1438
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,920
- Two weeks, two days, two
hours, whatever you want

1439
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,910
and the cash, I can
give you that right now.

1440
01:06:57,910 --> 01:06:59,760
- [Mickey] Oh, and another thing,

1441
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,810
I don't need any more sermons, all right?

1442
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,070
So lay off the Christian,

1443
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:06,050
power lifting bullshit, all right?

1444
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:07,180
- Okay, that's fine.

1445
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:08,990
So why don't you knock off
for the rest of the day

1446
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:10,330
and get yourself some sun maybe

1447
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:11,760
and go have a lap dance tonight

1448
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,710
and come in tomorrow
morning refreshed, okay?

1449
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:16,160
- [Woman] So I'm sort
of, you know thinking,

1450
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,590
why not just get that
highlights all through, right?

1451
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:20,640
It's like blonde and a little bit of red,

1452
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,770
or whatever to spice it up and
just sort of catch the light

1453
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:25,080
and sort of shimmer in the sun,

1454
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:25,913
make me feel a little summer-y,

1455
01:07:25,913 --> 01:07:28,460
and then she suggested just
get an inch cut off here

1456
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:29,650
and you know, a web,

1457
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:32,220
and just have it sort of
off my neck a little bit,

1458
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:34,970
you know, like so it'll swing
a little bit more freely.

1459
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:37,890
- Hi Lynn.

1460
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:39,300
- [Woman] Highlights here and maybe a few,

1461
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,074
just like a little
gold, red, I don't know,

1462
01:07:41,074 --> 01:07:43,324
just highlight the curls to
catch the light a little bit

1463
01:07:43,324 --> 01:07:44,157
and then just, you know,

1464
01:07:44,157 --> 01:07:46,203
just to get it a little
bit off my neck, like that,

1465
01:07:46,203 --> 01:07:47,920
just to cut a couple inches.

1466
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,333
What are you looking at?

1467
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:50,890
And just um, you know,

1468
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:53,720
sort of get it a little
bit off my neck maybe,

1469
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:57,747
or what I could do is pull
the whole thing up like this

1470
01:07:58,762 --> 01:08:01,093
and have it kind of splash like that.

1471
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,080
- Audrey, you know where
Mickey works, right?

1472
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:04,913
Well get over here

1473
01:08:04,913 --> 01:08:07,900
and don't give me any of
that DUI bullshit, okay?

1474
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,203
How about I owe you?

1475
01:08:10,171 --> 01:08:11,253
I'll be downstairs.

1476
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,990
- You're talking about security grants?

1477
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:17,300
- You want to know how much
it's going to take to get in?

1478
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,640
Well let me tell you.

1479
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,860
- Did I hear you say that
you're worried, Harold?

1480
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,383
No, no, no, there's no worry here.

1481
01:08:22,383 --> 01:08:23,860
- I'll tell him you called.

1482
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,317
Thanks, bye-bye.

1483
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:27,303
Hi.

1484
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:29,710
- Hi, we're here to see the
guy that runs this place.

1485
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:31,520
- Can I let him know
what this is regarding?

1486
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,593
- May I help you?

1487
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:34,480
- You can help me.

1488
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,732
I'm here for my father's $20,000.

1489
01:08:36,732 --> 01:08:38,360
- $20,000?

1490
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,960
Hey man, I'm just one of the guys.

1491
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,843
I just, you know, where's my phone?

1492
01:08:42,812 --> 01:08:43,645
- How you doing, man?

1493
01:08:43,645 --> 01:08:44,650
Hey, how you doing?

1494
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:46,550
- Yeah, I'm here for my father's $20,000.

1495
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:48,420
- Okay, not a problem, great.

1496
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:49,750
These guys with you, then?

1497
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:50,890
Okay, you are?

1498
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:51,920
I'm Eddie.

1499
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,410
- I need to speak to somebody in charge.

1500
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:55,660
- You take this metal,
you just listen to me?

1501
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,533
It's from their ass into your pocket.

1502
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:01,953
- Okay, it's not a problem.

1503
01:09:01,953 --> 01:09:03,460
He just stepped out
for a couple of minutes

1504
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,450
and I'm gonna just uh,
get him on the phone.

1505
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:06,620
If I can get you a beverage or something

1506
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,071
while you're waiting?

1507
01:09:08,071 --> 01:09:08,904
- It ain't going to be a habit,

1508
01:09:08,904 --> 01:09:10,470
I'll call you back, over and out.

1509
01:09:23,901 --> 01:09:27,130
- I left slash serviettes
this time for you guys.

1510
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,483
Thank you very much.

1511
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:37,361
- Oh my God.

1512
01:09:37,361 --> 01:09:40,262
Are you the owner of Sally's Kids?

1513
01:09:40,262 --> 01:09:41,915
- You ever remember a time
when you downed a couple of?

1514
01:09:41,915 --> 01:09:42,977
- I hate you!

1515
01:09:42,977 --> 01:09:44,477
I hate you, when I ever met you!

1516
01:09:44,477 --> 01:09:48,110
- I admit that I lie and I
cheat on the telephone, okay?

1517
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:50,430
This is what I do, I wear a black hat.

1518
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:52,990
I hate the fact you ever
came into my God damn life

1519
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:54,758
and if I ever see your fucking face

1520
01:09:54,758 --> 01:09:56,620
in my God damn house again,

1521
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:59,505
I will personally have you killed, okay?

1522
01:09:59,505 --> 01:10:01,010
You little piece of shit!

1523
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,651
Was I a mercy fuck?

1524
01:10:02,651 --> 01:10:04,390
- You know, I was going
to ask you the same thing.

1525
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:05,477
- Aw, fuck you.

1526
01:10:05,477 --> 01:10:07,220
- Same fucking thing.

1527
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:08,970
- Do you want to be with me or not?

1528
01:10:11,281 --> 01:10:12,531
- I don't know.

1529
01:10:14,137 --> 01:10:16,804
(phone ringing)

1530
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:21,790
- Kelly residence.

1531
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:22,940
- Sure, can you hold please?

1532
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:23,773
Thank you.

1533
01:10:28,484 --> 01:10:31,567
(subtle piano music)

1534
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:45,623
(subtle piano music)

1535
01:11:06,924 --> 01:11:09,507
- Saddle up, Mickey, you're on.

1536
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:26,560
- Okay, if you have anything left in you,

1537
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,570
let's put it together

1538
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:30,633
for the comedy stylings of Mickey Schwinn.

1539
01:11:32,447 --> 01:11:34,697
(applause)

1540
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:39,170
- Good morning everybody.

1541
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:40,023
How you doing today?

1542
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,860
Every 30 days around my household,

1543
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:49,080
I get the same question from
the old lady like clockwork.

1544
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,780
Hey Mickey, am I different
when I menstruate?

1545
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:54,376
Come on, you can tell me.

1546
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,750
Do I act different towards
you when I'm on my period?

1547
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,090
Let me think.

1548
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:00,720
Yeah, first of all, you're
bleeding all over the joint.

1549
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:01,873
Look at my face.

1550
01:12:03,457 --> 01:12:05,707
(laughter)

1551
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:11,540
Got a question for you.

1552
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:13,420
Why is it every time you're having sex,

1553
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:14,350
every time you're getting laid,

1554
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:16,240
you hear the same thing
over and over again?

1555
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,230
Fuck me, fuck me.

1556
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:19,420
Honey, I thought I was,

1557
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:21,633
unless you're talking to
some guy under the bed.

1558
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:23,883
(laughter)

1559
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:26,263
By the way,

1560
01:12:26,263 --> 01:12:28,330
my wife says I don't spend
enough time on foreplay.

1561
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:29,320
I asked her,

1562
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,585
what do you think six
months of stalking you was?

1563
01:12:31,585 --> 01:12:34,490
(laughter)

1564
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:37,004
Anybody do the psychic hotline yet?

1565
01:12:37,004 --> 01:12:37,837
No?

1566
01:12:37,837 --> 01:12:38,670
You get addicted to that

1567
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:40,170
and you run out of questions, right?

1568
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:42,870
Hey, psychic hotline, yeah, it's me again,

1569
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:44,160
I just ordered a pizza.

1570
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,503
Will it get here on time?

1571
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,600
Aliens from outer space.

1572
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,320
Why is it that they're
always smarter than us?

1573
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:56,200
A far superior intelligence
from way beyond

1574
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:59,420
that's going to come here
and teach us the way.

1575
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:01,840
If they're so smart and
they're so superior,

1576
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,000
you know what they're going to teach us?

1577
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,700
They're going to teach us
how to suck their dicks.

1578
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,800
(laughter)

1579
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,930
Ladies and gentlemen, that's my time.

1580
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:13,324
Thank you very much, tell your friends.

1581
01:13:13,324 --> 01:13:15,574
(applause)

1582
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:20,973
- That was Mickey Schwinn.

1583
01:13:20,973 --> 01:13:22,733
He did pretty good, keep an eye out.

1584
01:13:25,303 --> 01:13:27,649
- Hey Mickey,

1585
01:13:27,649 --> 01:13:29,732
you should be a comedian.

1586
01:13:31,628 --> 01:13:33,378
- Hey Bernie, thanks.

1587
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:13,070
Hey, I'm going on record to say that uh,

1588
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:14,870
I'd rather be with you than without you,

1589
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:16,390
so I love you.

1590
01:14:18,347 --> 01:14:19,270
You happy now?

1591
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:20,103
Over and out.

1592
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:35,062
Let me tell you something
about immigration.

1593
01:14:35,062 --> 01:14:37,494
(speaking Spanish)

1594
01:14:37,494 --> 01:14:38,410
Set this straight here.

1595
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:40,214
Half of the guys in Washington.

1596
01:14:40,214 --> 01:14:42,030
(speaking Spanish)

1597
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:43,339
- They don't want you in the country.

1598
01:14:43,339 --> 01:14:45,150
(speaking Spanish)

1599
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:46,474
- They're a bunch of half-breeds.

1600
01:14:46,474 --> 01:14:49,920
(speaking Spanish)

1601
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:50,753
- Mongrels.

1602
01:14:52,565 --> 01:14:54,170
(laughter)

1603
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:55,450
- The other half, right?

1604
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,350
The other half,

1605
01:14:57,510 --> 01:14:58,560
their parents came over

1606
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,513
maybe two seconds before everybody else.

1607
01:15:00,513 --> 01:15:03,430
(speaking Spanish)

1608
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,200
- What we should do is this.

1609
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:15,232
You make everybody married
by law, somebody different.

1610
01:15:15,232 --> 01:15:17,814
(speaking Spanish)

1611
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:19,414
You marry somebody from Germany.

1612
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:20,340
(speaking Spanish)

1613
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,530
- [Mickey] No Mexican, all right?

1614
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:23,894
You marry somebody from
France, a French girl.

1615
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,690
(speaking Spanish)

1616
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:28,983
You marry somebody from Italy, no Mexican.

1617
01:15:29,974 --> 01:15:32,577
I marry a Mexican.

1618
01:15:32,577 --> 01:15:34,454
(laughter)

1619
01:15:34,454 --> 01:15:37,371
(speaking Spanish)

1620
01:15:38,923 --> 01:15:42,340
- That way, in about 50, a hundred years.

1621
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:45,610
All the babies, the ninos, right?

1622
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:48,210
Everybody's the same,
everybody's everything, right?

1623
01:15:49,206 --> 01:15:50,039
And then,

1624
01:15:51,102 --> 01:15:54,998
and then you could hate everybody
else for no reason at all.

1625
01:15:54,998 --> 01:15:56,961
(laughter)

1626
01:15:56,961 --> 01:15:59,010
- This is the address for
tomorrow, seven o'clock.

1627
01:15:59,010 --> 01:15:59,843
- All right, I'll be there.

1628
01:15:59,843 --> 01:16:01,200
- Mickey, you did a good job today.

1629
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,033
- Okay.

1630
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:04,715
Thanks, I'll see you there.

1631
01:16:04,715 --> 01:16:06,965
(laughter)

1632
01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:12,030
I gotta go home, I gotta go to sleep,

1633
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:14,193
and I got to go to work at two o'clock,

1634
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,490
that's in the AM.

1635
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:18,410
- Work, what do you call this?

1636
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:20,620
- Hey come on, don't take this
the wrong way or anything,

1637
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:22,600
but a monkey could do this.

1638
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,192
- That's why you're so good at it.

1639
01:16:24,192 --> 01:16:25,540
(speaking Spanish)

1640
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:27,640
(laughter)

1641
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:29,040
- Hey Hector, you know what?

1642
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:33,460
Sometimes I think it might be better

1643
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:36,030
to have somebody to
laugh with and to go out,

1644
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:37,640
make somebody laugh.

1645
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,003
Do you know what I mean?

1646
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:42,363
- Yeah, yeah.

1647
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,690
- Thanks, see you tomorrow.

1648
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:47,523
- [Hector] See you tomorrow.

1649
01:16:47,523 --> 01:16:48,356
- All right.

1650
01:17:01,873 --> 01:17:04,623
(engine revving)

1651
01:17:11,885 --> 01:17:13,221
Shit.

1652
01:17:13,221 --> 01:17:14,888
Fucking cock sucker.

1653
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:19,393
Go around me.

1654
01:17:31,941 --> 01:17:34,524
(subtle music)

1655
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:39,420
- Hope you got insurance.

1656
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:41,000
Mad I didn't call?

1657
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,070
- [Mickey] Oh yeah, you know something?

1658
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:45,038
I did call you and I think
you do owe me a message.

1659
01:17:45,038 --> 01:17:46,750
- Yeah, what was the message?

1660
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:49,630
- I said that I loved you

1661
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:51,680
and that I'd rather be
with you than without you

1662
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:55,463
and I asked you if you were
happy and then I hung up.

1663
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,790
Hey Sally, look I mean, if
that's not the right thing,

1664
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:00,100
I mean, you know, I mean, I,

1665
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,060
I'd love to take you
out for a seasonal drink

1666
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:03,460
in the spirit of friendship.

1667
01:18:04,605 --> 01:18:06,212
- I don't know, Mickey.

1668
01:18:06,212 --> 01:18:07,045
God.

1669
01:18:07,045 --> 01:18:07,970
- You know what?

1670
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:10,470
I can take you out to a nice restaurant.

1671
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:12,990
I'll take you out to a
real French restaurant

1672
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:15,720
and you know, I'll behave
myself and you know,

1673
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,203
I'm telling you, just save
the last dance for me.

1674
01:18:19,045 --> 01:18:20,080
- On one condition.

1675
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,170
- Anything.

1676
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:22,033
- I drive.

1677
01:18:26,703 --> 01:18:28,357
(laughter)

1678
01:18:28,357 --> 01:18:31,312

(singing in Spanish)

1681
01:18:44,410 --> 01:18:45,760
- Fuck, right?

1682
