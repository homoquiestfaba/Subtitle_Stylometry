00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:40,378
She wants to know.

184
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:42,234
To be honest,
I can't wait.

185
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:43,963
But there are
one or two things

186
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:45,787
I'd like to
clear up first.

187
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:47,227
For example...

188
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:50,235
I've never heard of
an Italian called Tindle.

189
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:51,931
My father's name
is Tindolini.

190
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,180
Now, that's
lovely.

191
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:55,195
That's like a l-- little bell.
[CHUCKLES]

192
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:56,795
Why don't you go back
to Tindolini?

193
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:58,843
It suits you.
You think so?

194
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:01,916
Yes. So if and when
you marry Maggie,

195
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,220
she'll be Maggie
Tindolini.

196
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:07,291
Do you get a kick out of that? Mm.

197
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:08,188
What name do you
act under?

198
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:09,724
Tindle or Tindolini?

199
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:11,804
Tindle.
Why have I never heard of you?

200
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:13,244
You will...before long.

201
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:15,196
Really?
In spades.

202
00:09:15,197 --> 00:09:16,957
That sounds threatening.
Does it?

203
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:17,982
Doesn't it?

204
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,677
Why don't we get down
to brass tacks?

205
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:25,885
Brass tacks, yes.
Why not?

206
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:28,829
This is the way
I see it.

207
00:09:31,742 --> 00:09:32,989
Come upstairs.

208
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,454
I want to
show you something.

209
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:37,087
[#]

210
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:41,535
Are you all right
in elevators?

211
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:47,422
It won't make you sick
or anything, will it?

212
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:02,496
ANDREW:
This is our bedroom.

213
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:07,487
And this...

214
00:10:09,505 --> 00:10:11,169
is my wife's
dressing room.

215
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:14,944
She left
a few dresses.

216
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:16,961
Couldn't be bothered
to pick them up.

217
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:18,177
They're worth
thousands.

218
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,352
Thousands.

219
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,953
This leather coat
alone,

220
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,937
worth 5000 quid.

221
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:25,536
So you see,
the thing is this.

222
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:26,816
Uh...sit down.

223
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:31,329
The thing is this:

224
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,801
My wife spends money
like water,

225
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:34,690
so if you're
not careful,

226
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:35,842
she'll eat you

227
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,250
out of house
and home.

228
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:39,042
She was born
to luxury, you know.

229
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:40,962
Jamaica, the Ritz,
the Swiss Alps.

230
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:42,306
What are you?

231
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:44,769
Out-of-work actor,
part-time chauffeur.

232
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,211
You're out of
your depth, old boy.

233
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,811
You're on a hiding
to nothing.

234
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:48,995
If you think
you're broke now,

235
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:50,882
you'll be
10 times broker

236
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,867
by the time she's
finished with you.

237
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:54,787
She'll have your guts
for garters.

238
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:55,843
[CHUCKLES]

239
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:57,058
She's in love with me.

240
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:59,139
Oh, never trust
in love, chum.

241
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,611
Love will kick you
up the arse

242
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:01,699
as soon as
look at you.

243
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,875
One minute,
it's love,

244
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:05,731
10 minutes later,
it's contempt.

245
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,524
That's your own
experience, is it?

246
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:10,339
Oh, no, no, no.
That's observation.

247
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,708
Don't forget,
I'm a novelist.

248
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:13,988
I observe people.

249
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:16,611
What I'm getting at
is this--

250
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:18,340
Is you won't be able to
give her what she wants.

251
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:19,396
So she's gonna
leave you,

252
00:11:19,397 --> 00:11:21,605
come back to me.

253
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:22,790
And I don't want her
near me.

254
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,389
I mean, that's
the last thing I want.

255
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,245
I've had her
up to here.

256
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:27,910
Anyway, I've got
this lovely mistress.

257
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:29,988
She runs a-- A sauna in--
In Swindon.

258
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,237
She's my girl.

259
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:34,726
So you see, I want
Maggie to stay with you.

260
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,389
I want...you two

261
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,701
to be together
forever.

262
00:11:37,702 --> 00:11:39,206
But unless
you listen to me,

263
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:41,254
the whole thing will be
a fucking disaster

264
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:43,910
with catastrophic
consequences all round.

265
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:47,430
But...

266
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:48,679
I have a solution.

267
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,359
You won't believe
what I'm gonna say.

268
00:11:58,056 --> 00:12:00,072
What are you
gonna say?

269
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:03,143
I'm all ears.

270
00:12:03,144 --> 00:12:04,647
You know something?

271
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:06,823
I'm beginning to respond
to your charm.

272
00:12:06,824 --> 00:12:08,711
Get away.
No, it's true.

273
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:09,767
I'm really touched.

274
00:12:09,768 --> 00:12:11,816
You should be.

275
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:13,609
Tell me, I-I bet
you didn't

276
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,400
expect me to be
so intelligent.

277
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,321
So...quick-witted.
Did you?

278
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:19,145
Oh. I did.

279
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:20,809
Quite.

280
00:12:22,217 --> 00:12:23,689
Maggie told you,
did she?

281
00:12:27,658 --> 00:12:29,928
What's your solution?

282
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:32,810
[#]

283
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,689
It's a close fit,
isn't it?

284
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:38,122
For two.
[LAUGHS]

285
00:12:45,803 --> 00:12:47,881
Listen...

286
00:12:47,882 --> 00:12:49,547
I'm going to make you
a proposition.

287
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:53,356
A few years ago,
I gave her some jewels.

288
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,307
Amazingly expensive.

289
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,251
Oh, I-- I didn't give 'em
to her. I-- I own them.

290
00:12:58,252 --> 00:12:59,691
They're insured
in my name.

291
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:02,987
But I let her use them
on special occasions.

292
00:13:02,988 --> 00:13:05,547
They're worth
1 million pounds.

293
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:07,052
They spend half the time
in the bank,

294
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,812
half the time
in the safe.

295
00:13:08,813 --> 00:13:09,964
At the moment...

296
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:12,620
they're here in the house,
in the safe.

297
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:15,020
And I want you...

298
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,613
to steal them.

299
00:13:21,485 --> 00:13:22,924
Steal them?

300
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:24,397
That's right.

301
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:25,997
What the hell
do you mean?

302
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:28,237
I want you to steal the jewels.

303
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:29,773
You want me to steal the jewels?
Mm.

304
00:13:29,774 --> 00:13:31,085
I don't get it.

305
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:33,453
It's very simple. You steal
the jewels, sell them abroad,

306
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:36,269
and you live happily
ever after with Maggie.

307
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,574
I'll get rid of my wife
and I'll be like a pig in shit.

308
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:40,845
And you can keep Maggie
in the manner

309
00:13:40,846 --> 00:13:42,286
to which she's become
accustomed.

310
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:45,421
You want me to take part
in a scummy little plot

311
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:47,950
to defraud your insurance
company, is that it?

312
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:49,198
I thought it was quite elegant.

313
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,086
What do you think I am?

314
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:53,870
I mean, what the fuck are you
actually talking about?

315
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:55,055
These are real facts.

316
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:56,430
This is a joke.
No, it isn't.

317
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:57,902
It's also a trap.
A trap?

318
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:58,830
Yes, a trap.
You think I'm a fool?

319
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:00,175
Well, are you?

320
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:01,807
It doesn't hold up.
Why not?

321
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:03,600
They're worth a million pounds?
Correct.

322
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,615
You'd only get a fraction
of that from any fence.

323
00:14:05,616 --> 00:14:08,496
I have already contacted
a friend of mine in Amsterdam.

324
00:14:08,497 --> 00:14:12,623
And he will give you
800,000 pounds tax-free.

325
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:14,831
Now, think about it.

326
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:19,056
Eight hundred
thousand pounds...

327
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:20,625
tax-free.

328
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:24,976
Why would he do that?

329
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:26,416
Because when you steal
the jewels,

330
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:27,408
you will also steal
the receipts.

331
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,201
So he'll have title
to the jewels,

332
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,472
as well as the jewels
themselves,

333
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:33,649
so that when he sells them,
he gets full value.

334
00:14:37,202 --> 00:14:38,737
Got it?

335
00:14:38,738 --> 00:14:39,697
Think about it.

336
00:14:39,698 --> 00:14:40,978
[#]

337
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:42,290
Take your time.

338
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:01,779
And why would you
do all this?

339
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,435
Listen...

340
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:05,714
under this crooked
exterior,

341
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:08,083
I am a simple,
honest man.

342
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:09,940
Every word I've
told you is true,

343
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:11,636
I swear it.

344
00:15:11,637 --> 00:15:12,948
I want to get rid
of my wife,

345
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:15,124
but I want it
to be solid,

346
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:15,572
permanent.

347
00:15:17,044 --> 00:15:18,516
I don't want her
on my back.

348
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,308
I want her to stay
on your back.

349
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,621
This is a frame-up.

350
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:23,059
A frame-up?

351
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,211
Yes.

352
00:15:24,212 --> 00:15:26,836
You want to
destroy me.

353
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:28,053
You want to see me
in jail.

354
00:15:28,054 --> 00:15:29,301
You want me to do this,

355
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:31,541
and then shop me
to the police.

356
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:33,301
No. No, no,
no, no.

357
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:35,701
If-- If I shop you,
then you'll shop me,

358
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,077
and then we'll both
end up in jail.

359
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:38,517

a dodgy fuse

I'll phone the electrician
in the morning.

00:47:35,922 --> 00:47:37,265
Metaphorically.

1083
00:47:37,266 --> 00:47:40,337
You gave him a metaphorical
pat on the bum?

1084
00:47:40,338 --> 00:47:42,160
Sure.
How did he take it?

1085

What?
The pat.

1086
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:45,648
He was fine. He told me

1087
00:47:45,649 --> 00:47:48,913
that it was game, set
and match to me.

1088
00:47:48,914 --> 00:47:51,377
So this guy
had a sense of humor,

1089
00:47:51,378 --> 00:47:52,242

you're saying?

So tell me...

1093

what was the point
of all this?

1094
00:47:58,642 --> 00:47:59,794
Humiliation.

your wife's lover

fucking wreck in front of you.

I liked him.

become good friends.

my wife's shoes,

And did you?
Oh, yes.

00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,509
He was really, uh...

1111
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:37,108
