in this year's
park service budget,

109
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:07,692
so we signed on to find
a new tree, bring it to DC

110
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,761

116
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:22,908
You want to uproot the tree,
put it on the back of a truck,

117
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,644
drive it across country and
plant it at the White House?

going to transport it,

131
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,148
keep it alive, along the way?

132
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:05,750
A licenced arborist
will supervise

133
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,886
and a team of professionals
will drive it cross-country.

134
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,955
It'll be in good hands.

135
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,624

136

00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,144
to meet the president.

174
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,482
But you don't care about me.
All you care about is the tree.

175
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,154
MAN ON PHONE:
<i>Well, shall we offer</i>
<i>more money?</i>

176
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,789
I don't think it's about
the money.

177
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,425
I think the father's just really
protective of the tree.

178
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,427
So, we go to plan B.

179
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,563
<i>No, no. Not yet.</i>
<i>I mean, I'm here,</i>

180
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,698
I've given them
until tomorrow morning.

181
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,567
Let's just see how it plays out.

182
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:38,903
Whatever you say.
It's your baby.

183
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,939
Okay, I'll keep you posted.

184
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,378
Hi, sweetheart.

185
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:51,249
No, I'm still in Liberty,
ironing out details.

186
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,452
I can't wait either.
How are your mom and dad?

187
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,855
Ah, I miss you too.

188
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:01,659
You in, Hank?

189
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,462
5 bucks.

190
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:09,467
See that? And... raise.

191
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,002
You're bluffing.

192
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,837
Only one way to find out.

193
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:21,012
Well, one of us is. Take it.

194
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,881
You know, I think you're out of
line on this one, Corey.

195
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,017
Eddie's right. It's Rock's tree.

196
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,752
He should be able to do
whatever he wants with it.

197
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:30,621
Transplanting a tree that big,

198
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,157
and 3,000 miles away...

199
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,026
It can be done.

200
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:38,496
Look, I understand that it is
cool and exciting for Rock

201
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,831
that they picked the tree

202
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,900
and they want to
put it on display in DC,

203
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:47,972
but once that tree is gone
from here, it's gone forever.

204
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,374
Yeah, well,
let's bottom line this.

205
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:53,177
Whose tree is it?
Who does it belong to?

206
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:56,214
Who didn't ante?

207
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,752
Come on, Corey.

208
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,254
It might be an opportunity to
spend some time with Rock.

209
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,059
Must be tough.

210
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,126
What?

211
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,596
Well, knowing Rock
will be gone soon.

212
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:16,134
He's still got
a year and a half.

213
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,935
That will go fast.
Core's 14, Connor's 12.

214
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,604
I'm already thinking about it.

215
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,741
You're really cheering me up
here, Hank.

216
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:25,343
What are you going to do
when he's gone?

217
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,779
I do not want to
think about that, all right?

218
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,484
You really think
that tree can be moved?

219
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,486
Trees get moved all the time.

220
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:38,757
This one's a little bigger, it's
going a little further, sure.

221
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,431
I'll see you tomorrow.

222
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,300
Yeah, all right.

223
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:59,410
♪

224
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,652
Rock?

225
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,121
Yeah?

226
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,929
You're right. It's your tree.

227
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,198
You want to see it
planted in DC,

228
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:24,602
then that's your decision,
not mine.

229
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:28,339
But I don't want strangers
doing it.

230
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:32,544
I'm going to drive it to
Washington and I need help.

231
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,414
I want you to come with me.

232
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,284
But they were going to
fly me there.

233
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,854
Yeah, well, that's the deal.
Take it or leave it.

234
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:58,035
<i>The national tree, Rock?</i>
<i>That's awesome.</i>

235
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,504
<i>It gets lit the day</i>
<i>after Thanksgiving?</i>

236
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,373
<i>Is Thanksgiving Day</i>
<i>close to Christmas?</i>

237
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,708
<i>Not even. But in America,</i>

238
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,042
<i>we start putting up</i>

239
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,845
<i>right after Halloween.</i>

240
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,916
The thing is, I have to travel
with my dad for, like, a week.

241
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:14,853
<i>Ooh, brutal.</i>

242
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,387
Yeah. I don't know if
I can handle that.

243
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,055
I'm thinking about
maybe not going.

244
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,190
<i>You have to go, Rock.</i>

245
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:23,061
<i>Hey, would you be</i>
<i>coming out I-80?</i>

246
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,930
I don't know.

247
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,264
<i>Because if you are,</i>
<i>you'll go straight to Cheyenne,</i>

248
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,003
<i>and I'm only, like,</i>
<i>40 miles from there.</i>

249
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:34,538
It'll take us 3 days
to get the tree ready,

250
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,473
to really pare the root bed

251
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,810
and make sure it's viable
for transplanting.

252
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:40,345
That doesn't give us
a lot of time.

253
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,879
We need to be in DC
no later than Thanksgiving.

254
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,548
That's November 26th.

255
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,350
We can do that. My crew and I
start this afternoon,

256
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,618
we're ready by Friday,
that's the 20th.

257
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:48,887
That gives us 6 days
to get there.

258
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,089
So, are we taking I-80?

259
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,758
Yep.

260
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:55,426
We'll stop each night
at one of our stores,

261
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,628
give people a chance
to see the tree.

262
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,764
Yeah, maybe, if we have time.

263
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:03,868
We're stopping, Corey. Box of
Toys is underwriting this trip.

264
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,439
Are we going through Cheyenne?

265
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,308
Yeah, we're stopping there
the second night.

266
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,910
So, when do we leave?

267
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:15,579
Looking forward to hitting the
road with the old man, huh?

268
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:19,583
Ah, father and son on a journey
across America together,

269
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:23,320
delivering our national tree
to our nation's capital.

270
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,456
As a marketing rep,
I can work with that.

271
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,760
I can definitely work with that.

272
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,069
Friday morning, November 20th.

273
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:41,872
My Sitka's about ready to see
the world. Or America, at least.

274
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:45,777
Here's the drill:
We go through Oregon.

275
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,949
Then Idaho.

276
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,083
Then once we pick it up,

277
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,152
it's pretty much
the I-80 all the way.

278
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,956
First stop,
Salt Lake City, Utah,

279
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:02,293
home of the Mormons
and other things.

280
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:07,364
The next night, Cheyenne,
Wyoming, where the historic

281
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,300
Rock/Katie face-to-face meeting
will happen.

282
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:13,571
I'm excited about that.

283
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,607
Then it's Omaha, NE.

284
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,981
Chicago, IL, my kind of town.

285
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,786
Grove City, Pennsylvania.

286
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,857
And finally, Washington DC.

287
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,597
Let's kick it.

288
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,600
That's a great root bundle
there, Hank.

289
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:46,070
As long as I don't
fall off the tree, right?

290
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,471
And you've got to love
that banner.

291
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,475
Box of Toys knows an advertising
opportunity when it sees one,

292
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,343
although they might have
measured it first

293
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,946
to fit the tree.

294
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:59,417
Hank's Ebert and Roeper today.

295
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,418
Eddie, make sure
the front strap's secure.

296
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:04,621
Ah, bungee cords,
the miracle rope.

297
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,491
They can hold down anything.

298
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:11,295
And the final piece of the
puzzle, our fearless companion.

299
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,302
Love the sign.

300
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,373
Wouldn't have been my first
choice for a vanity plate.

301
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,109
You're bringing
that camera with you?

302
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:28,780
Just for my friends.
You know, the road, DC.

303
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,849
Right. Could we link it up
with the company website?

304
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,918
We have a national tree page.

305
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,386
Sure.

306
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,854
Cool.

307
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:37,988
All right, we're good to go.

308
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,857
Let me just grab my gear.

309
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,659
All that gear.

310
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,994
Let's hope he remembered
to pack some clothes, huh?

311
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,129
We're good to go.

312
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,731
All right, guys. Thanks.

313
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:50,067
Speaking of gear, I don't have
a cell. That's Rocks number.

314
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,071
Oh, okay. Great, thanks.

315
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:55,173
Let's go.

316
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,412
I'm ready. Let's kick it.

317
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,115
Okay. See you at lunch.

318
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:10,555

Hi sweetheart.
You got my message?

321
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:22,767
I know, I'm disappointed
too but--

322
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,236
I know.

323
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,639
I know, but this is
my job, John,

324
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,241
and it's an incredible
marketing opportunity.

325
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,978
The human interest angle is--

326
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,580
Don't say that.

327
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,984
John? John?

329

Don't forget to write!

337
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,360
I'll send you a postcard
from DC.

Yeah. Turn that thing off.

camera shy this morning, folks.

345

Oh no, it's iced tea.
I can't stand the taste of beer.

883

Yeah, I heard it was on
the TV news a little bit.

884
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:17,733
Oh, I haven't been watching
the TV,

885
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:19,935
I've been watching Rock's vlog.

Oh, boy.

890
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:28,878
Okay, I told some of the
neighbours you were coming by

891
00:52:29,013 --> 00:52:32,347
and they're very excited
about what you're doing.

892
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:35,817
Well, I was wondering, would you
mind posing for a few pictures

893
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:37,620
and signing a couple
of autographs?

894
00:52:37,622 --> 00:52:38,687
Sure, Grandma.

895
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:41,490
Ah, thanks. Thank you.

Well, yeah.
He's a little bit closed.

901
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:03,846
You know, when Rock was born,
he was so excited

902
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:07,048
and the only way he could show
it was by planting that tree.

903
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:10,652
He watched the 2 of them
grew up together.

904
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:14,323
But since Stephie passed,
I think he's been doing his duty

905
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:18,460
but he hasn't opened his heart.

906
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:25,200
Anyway, did you know that he
used to cut down trees?

907
00:53:25,236 --> 00:53:26,602
Corey did?

908
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:29,938

do that anymore?

01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:18,800
But why aren't we
planting the tree?

1213
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:20,935
Well, I mean, they saw how much
excitement the tree generated

1214
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,070
and they thought, "Why plant it

1215
01:12:23,073 --> 01:12:26,207
when we can do this again
next year? Every year."

1216
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,442
They're already putting together
a series pitch,

1217
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:30,878
kind of an "Amazing Race" thing,

1218
01:12:30,914 --> 01:12:33,147
4 or maybe 6 trees
all competing to get to DC.

1219
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:36,617
They? Who's "They"?

1220
01:12:36,653 --> 01:12:37,684
Marketing.

1221
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:38,886
Marketing?

1222
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,421
Well, I'm not crazy
about the idea

1223
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:42,489
and I weighed in with that but--

1224
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:46,160
You and I are Marketing,
so I am telling you

1225
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:49,830
that Corey Burdock does not want
that tree to be cut.

1226
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:54,368
I know and I feel as bad about
this as you do but...

1227
01:12:54,404 --> 01:12:56,170
It's out of our hands.

1228
01:12:56,172 --> 01:13:00,308
Either we plant that tree or...

1229
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:02,443
I quit.

1230
01:13:09,452 --> 01:13:13,053
Rock, it's me, Faith. Call me as
soon as you get this message

1231
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:15,189
and if you haven't delivered
the tree yet, don't.

1232
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:19,393
Don't do this, Faith.
You'll regret it.

1233
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:21,629
Don't do this, Faith.

1234
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:37,178
Mr. Burdock, I'll need your
signature right here.

1235
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:40,648
Okay, so Capital buildings,
Smithsonian, an hour there.

1236
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:41,682
No, 2.

1237
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:43,484
Okay, fine, 2. And then
the Washington monument,

1238
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,219
Lincoln Memorial
and Vietnam wall--

1239
01:13:45,255 --> 01:13:47,555
And the International Spy
Museum. We can't miss that.

1240
01:13:47,624 --> 01:13:49,357
There's an
International Spy Museum?

1241
01:13:49,492 --> 01:13:51,425
Hey, superstar. You want to
go talk to your public

1242
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:54,061
and then we'll go get
something to eat?

1243
01:13:59,803 --> 01:14:01,502
This is unbelievable.

1244
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:20,655
Excuse me. What is that?

1245
01:14:20,657 --> 01:14:22,790
That's the stand for the tree.

1246
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:26,727
Stand for--?

1247
01:14:26,763 --> 01:14:29,063
They're not planting the tree.

1248
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:30,531
I know, they told me last night.
I've been trying to call.

1249
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,200
Last night?
Why didn't you tell me?

1250
01:14:32,335 --> 01:14:34,001
I thought it was a mistake.

1251
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,202
You let me bring the tree here

1252
01:14:35,271 --> 01:14:37,137
and you knew
they were going to cut it?

1253
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:38,406
I came in early
to straighten things out.

1254
01:14:38,408 --> 01:14:42,176
I trusted you, Faith.
I believed you.

1255
01:14:49,185 --> 01:14:52,720
This is a mistake.
You can't cut down the tree.

1256
01:14:52,722 --> 01:14:54,555
I told you, ma'am,
I have my instructions.

1257
01:14:54,624 --> 01:14:57,558
Look, we're not staying
for the lighting.

1258
01:14:57,693 --> 01:14:59,560
What?

1259
01:14:59,596 --> 01:15:01,495
They are not going to
plant the tree.

1260
01:15:01,498 --> 01:15:03,831
They're going to stick it in a
stand, they're going to cut it.

1261
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,366
Well, tell them
they can't do that.

1262
01:15:05,435 --> 01:15:08,769
I can't, I just--
I signed it over to them.

1263
01:15:08,805 --> 01:15:12,773
They're still going on with the
ceremony, right? The lighting?

1264
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:15,910
Of course, it's on
national television.

1265
01:15:15,979 --> 01:15:20,113
I want to be here.

1266
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:21,582
You want to stand up
in front of the world

1267
01:15:21,618 --> 01:15:23,117
and to watch them celebrate
the lighting of your dead tree?

1268
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:24,852
Yeah, that's why we came here.

1269
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,854
So that they could kill it?

1270
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:29,657
The tree that we nurtured
for 17 years?

1271
01:15:29,726 --> 01:15:30,925
No, I--

1272
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:33,060
Rock, this is your tree, Rock.

I know--

1274
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:37,899
We drove it across the country
together to keep it alive.

1275
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:43,537
What is important to you, Son?
What do you care about?

1276
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:47,141
He won't budge. He says
his orders come from

1277
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:48,943
the commissioner
and he has to follow them.

1278
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:51,679
I'm going back to the hotel.
I'm not watching this.

Call me after
the festivities are over.

1282

I can trust you to do that,
can't I?

1283
01:16:09,098 --> 01:16:12,767
This is not my doing. Please
tell me that you believe me.

1284
01:16:12,769 --> 01:16:14,501

I want everyone who visits
Washington from America

1381
01:22:27,743 --> 01:22:30,677
and all over the world
to see it and to understand

1382
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:34,547

this tree is America.

It may not be perfect,

1384
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:40,888
but it's strong, it's alive,

1385
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:45,692
it's here to stay. So, we need
to nurture it, protect it,

1386
01:22:45,695 --> 01:22:49,429

and protect each other.

This is a restricted area.

You're trespassing.

we're not moving. Not willingly.
