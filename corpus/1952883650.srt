1
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,500
Your brother's soul is mine.

2
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,388
Liu!

3
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,182
You will be next.

4
00:02:09,352 --> 00:02:10,785
Chan.

5
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:34,741
"Liu Kang - Brother Dead.
Return home. Grandfather"

6
00:02:43,553 --> 00:02:44,542
Let's go.

7
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:47,717
Is the perimeter secured?

8
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,454
- Yes!
- Better be, I want Kano.

9
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:54,726
- Trust me.
- I trust 1 person. You talk to her.

10
00:03:14,353 --> 00:03:15,911
Good boy.

11
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:19,490
She's here.

12
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,259
Right on time.

13
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:27,661
I love punctuality in a woman...

14
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,565
don't you...

15
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:32,433
Mr. Shang Tsung?

16
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,707
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?

17
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,703
You killed her partner, didn't you?

18
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:45,141
She'll follow you into hell.

19
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:47,412
Just make sure she's on that boat.

20
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,115
Sonya Blade must be at the tournament.

21
00:03:54,961 --> 00:03:57,395
Me and Sonya should share a cabin.

22
00:03:57,463 --> 00:04:00,694
Have our own little honeymoon cruise.

23
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:04,396
If you so much as touch her, Kano...

24
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:08,269
you'll need a seeing eye dog.

25
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,439
Where's Kano?

26
00:04:48,315 --> 00:04:50,283
Where is he?

27
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:24,411
Let's dance.

28
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,179
This is where you fall down.

29
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:06,854
Where do you get these guys?

30
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,558
The press says I don't know
how to do this stuff?

31
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:13,626
- Cut. Reset. Back in 15.
- I won't do it again.

32
00:06:13,704 --> 00:06:15,365
- What do you mean?
- I won't.

33
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,272
- It's the last shot! Where you going?
- To my trailer.

34
00:06:18,342 --> 00:06:21,334
Then I'll shoot myself for being
in your movie.

35
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:24,006
Kill me.
I'll be back directing traffic.

36
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:26,812
Don't leave me hanging up here.
You're killing me!

37
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:28,748
I love you. I need you.

38
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,947
Excuse me,

39
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:33,853
there's someone who wants
to speak to you.

40
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:36,393
- Who is it?
- I don't really know.

41
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:40,522
- You don't know who's on the set?
- No, of course not. I...

42
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:43,829
- It had better not be a reporter.
- Oh God, no.

43
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,529
You want me to find out?

44
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:51,165
Oh, great.

45
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:53,177
Mister, you're in my chair.

46
00:06:53,244 --> 00:06:55,337
"Johnny Cage A Fake!"

47
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,514
Hi, Johnny.

48
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:02,516
Master Boyd.

49
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:06,421
The press is still giving you
a hard time.

50
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,323
Yeah, they think I'm a fake.

51
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:12,227
You're one of the best
martial artists in the world...

52
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:15,095
and I can help you prove it.

53
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:16,259
Prove it? How?

54
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,065
A tournament.

55
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,571
The tournament.

56
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:22,801
It's held once a generation.

57
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,408
The world's best fighters
are invited.

58
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,971
You win the tournament,
you win their respect.

59
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,883
They'll tell the entire world
you're the real goods.

60
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,387
- So how do I...?
- There's a boat.

61
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,423
Leaves pier forty...

62
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,390
Hong Kong, tomorrow.

63
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,257
Be on it.

64
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,645
"The Temple of Light, China"

65
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:39,719
Liu.

66
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:51,332
Is this the place?

67
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,866
Yes.

68
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:55,698
This is where we found his body.

69
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,499
What happened?

70
00:08:57,572 --> 00:09:00,040
After you left for America...

71
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:02,270
he followed in your footsteps.

72
00:09:02,345 --> 00:09:04,142
Preparing for the tournament.

73
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:08,377
Grandfather... it wasn't enough
to fill my head with that nonsense?

74
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:11,011
To save the world is not nonsense.

75
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:15,421
Men fighting in a simple contest
don't decide these things.

76
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:17,186
How can a wise man believe this?

77
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:19,227
We all believe in it...

78
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:21,195
including your brother.

79
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:40,011
Liu Kang has been given the dream.

80
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,983
He is the Chosen One.

81
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:46,819
No. He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.

82
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,757
Why have you come back?

83
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,296
I want to represent the Order of Light
at the Tournament.

84
00:09:53,397 --> 00:09:54,989
For what reason?

85
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:57,896
My brother's killer will be there.

86
00:09:57,968 --> 00:10:01,096
That cannot be your only reason
for going...

87
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:03,366
or you will fail.

88
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,034
Oh yes, I forgot.

89
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:09,135
We're fighting for the fate
of the world.

90
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:11,408
That's why you left the temple...

91
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:14,279
and ran away, isn't it?

92
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:27,897
The Great Tournament
was too much responsibility.

93
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:29,433
But vengeance...

94
00:10:31,704 --> 00:10:33,865
that's so much simpler.

95
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:35,873
Lord Rayden.

96
00:10:39,277 --> 00:10:41,871
You're still running away
from your destiny.

97
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:48,043
Rayden?

98
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:50,411
Grandfather, get up.

99
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:53,287
This isn't your God of Thunder.

100
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:56,351
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.

101
00:10:56,463 --> 00:10:59,523
American life has enfeebled his mind.

102
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:01,496
Too much television.

103
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:04,059
So, you're going to
win the tournament?

104
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,570
- Yes, I am.
- Show me how.

105
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:12,610
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid...

106
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,374
of a simple beggar?

107
00:11:28,194 --> 00:11:30,128
If you are Rayden...

108
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,564
why did you let Chan die?

109
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:37,070
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?

110
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,732
I've had enough of this.

111
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,311
I'll find my brother's killer
at the tournament.

112
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:48,644
With or without your consent.

113
00:11:57,725 --> 00:11:59,886
He isn't ready, my Lord...

114
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,951
and we lost so much time.

115
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:04,054
I know.

116
00:12:04,165 --> 00:12:05,928
But there is no one else.

117
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,751
"Chai Wan Bay, Hong Kong"

118
00:12:35,298 --> 00:12:37,061
Ah, give me a break.

119
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:43,566
"Johnny Cage Fake!"

120
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,267
- Sure.

121
00:12:47,677 --> 00:12:49,440
Aren't you Art Lean?

122
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:52,538
I saw you fight in London,
you're great.

123
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:57,416
Thanks. I saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.

124
00:12:57,487 --> 00:12:59,648
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.

125
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,924
Pal, when the ship comes in...

126
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:09,328
could you put these on board?

127
00:13:09,398 --> 00:13:11,423
You want me to carry your luggage?

128
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:15,061
I pay money. You carry bags.

129
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:18,198
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.

130
00:13:18,308 --> 00:13:19,434
I got it.

131
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:20,942
Good.

132
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:37,819
Thank God I didn't ask him
to park the car.

133
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:45,197
Nothing says that creep at the club
wasn't lying.

134
00:13:45,303 --> 00:13:47,737
Kano could be 1000 miles
from here by now.

135
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:54,041
What is that?

136
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:06,115
You must be kidding me.

137
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:25,810
Wait.

138
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:27,812
That's it, Blade...

139
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:30,310
come to Papa.

140
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:41,284
Sonya, don't get on that thing.

141
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,987
Hey, Sonya!

142
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:07,177
Hey, you.

143
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:10,579
Alright, tough guy, you want to get...

144
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:11,749
tough?

145
00:15:11,825 --> 00:15:13,383
No. Do you?

146
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,827
I'm Johnny Cage.
And you are?

147
00:15:16,897 --> 00:15:18,831
Where's Kano?

148
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:21,826
I don't know who you're talking about.

149
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:24,771
But I can help you find him.

150
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,773
Out of my way.

151
00:15:29,076 --> 00:15:31,510
Just another starstruck fan, huh?

152
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,134
I'm honored to finally meet you.

153
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,600
Shang Tsung at your service.

154
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,279
I'm looking for a murderer.
He boarded this ship.

155
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,940
I'm impressed.

156
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:11,179
But it is my boat,
and if you'd like a tour...

157
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:14,051
I'd love to give it to you myself.

158
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,924
Be nice to the lady.

159
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:18,755
She's doing her job.

160
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:21,956
When I want back-up
I'll radio for it.

161
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,062
Got that radio handy?

162
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:38,576
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.

163
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:42,015
The deadliest of enemies...

164
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,178
but slaves under my power.

165
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:47,519
Move aside.

166
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,480
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.

167
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:22,821
How good of you to grace us
with your...

168
00:17:23,528 --> 00:17:24,722
presence.

169
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:29,626
Your sideshow freaks
attacked my fighters.

170
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:33,467
That is expressly forbidden
before the tournament...

171
00:17:33,538 --> 00:17:35,529
as your emperor well knows.

172
00:17:35,607 --> 00:17:38,132
My sincere apologies.

173
00:17:38,242 --> 00:17:40,301
It won't happen again,
I promise you.

174
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:42,743
- I shall see to that.
- Of course.

175
00:17:44,082 --> 00:17:46,016
Until we reach the island...

176
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:47,949
where you have no dominion.

177
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:50,613
My dominions are well known to me,
sorcerer.

178
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,157
- Thank you.
- What tournament?

179
00:17:55,093 --> 00:17:57,186
You've been chosen, Sonya.

180
00:17:58,564 --> 00:18:01,328
Much to my delight.

181
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:08,795
You really are Rayden.

182
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,032
Come with me.

183
00:18:16,248 --> 00:18:20,116
1 guy with things coming
out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff...

184
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:23,622
and 1 man who seems to be made
out of electricity.

185
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:27,125
How did he disappear?
What's going on? Who is he?

186
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:29,218
Let's think this through.

187
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:31,423
There is a rational explanation.

188
00:18:31,497 --> 00:18:36,127
He's Rayden, God of Lightening
and Protector of the Realm of Earth.

189
00:18:36,203 --> 00:18:38,467
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.

190
00:18:38,538 --> 00:18:39,971
Listen.

191
00:18:41,508 --> 00:18:43,499
What you're about to face is...

192
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:45,545
vastly more important than...

193
00:18:45,612 --> 00:18:47,842
your ego...

194
00:18:47,948 --> 00:18:49,540
your enemy...

195
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:53,312
or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked...

196
00:18:53,386 --> 00:18:55,786
on a sacred mission.

197
00:18:55,856 --> 00:18:59,417
You have been chosen to defend
the Realm of Earth...

198
00:18:59,492 --> 00:19:02,393
in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.

199
00:19:02,463 --> 00:19:04,090
Defend it from who?

200
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,967
Your world is but
one of many realms.

201
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:12,562
One of them is a forsaken land
called Outworld...

202
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,303
ruled by an immortal
who has crowned himself emperor.

203
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:19,835
Now he seeks a new world
to conquer and enslave.

204
00:19:19,947 --> 00:19:21,847
Now, wait a second.

205
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,248
If this guy is so powerful...

206
00:19:24,318 --> 00:19:26,183
why doesn't he invade us?

207
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:28,381
To enter the Realm of Earth

208
00:19:28,456 --> 00:19:31,118
the Emperor's demon sorcerer,
Shang Tsung...

209
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:35,322
and his warriors must win 10 straight
victories in Mortal Kombat.

210
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:39,327
They have won nine.

211
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:42,393
This will be the tenth.

212
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,497
A handful of people on a leaky boat
are going to save the world?

213
00:19:47,308 --> 00:19:48,900
Exactly.

214
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:52,775
The essence of Mortal Kombat...

215
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,309
is not about death...

216
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,054
but life.

217
00:20:01,457 --> 00:20:03,288
Mortal men and women...

218
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:05,258
defending your own world.

219
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:07,318
Why are you telling me this?

220
00:20:07,396 --> 00:20:09,296
What about the others?

221
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:11,628
They are all great fighters...

222
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:15,665
but I have looked
into their souls...

223
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,340
and yours.

224
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:22,037
One of you will decide
the outcome of the tournament.

225
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:26,276
The fate...

226
00:20:26,382 --> 00:20:28,942
of billions will depend upon you.

227
00:20:31,922 --> 00:20:33,514
Sorry.

228
00:20:34,258 --> 00:20:35,691
What about Shang Tsung?

229
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,529
Oh, still concerned
only with vengeance?

230
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,568
If you challenge Shang Tsung now...

231
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,968
you'll lose your life and your soul.

232
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,166
He'll pay for my brother's death.

233
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,810
You're not ready.

234
00:20:57,848 --> 00:20:58,872
Look.

235
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:02,180
It has begun.

236
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:21,228
It has begun.

237
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:50,531
Black Hawk to Cardinal.

238
00:21:50,603 --> 00:21:54,369
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
Is anybody monitoring?

239
00:21:56,876 --> 00:22:00,141
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?

240
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:03,409
While you're at it,
call my agent.

241
00:22:03,517 --> 00:22:05,747
Do I look like your secretary?

242
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,642
What are you doing?

243
00:22:34,714 --> 00:22:37,911
The electrical disturbance
blew out the transistors.

244
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:39,987
Your radio equipment's fine.

245
00:22:40,053 --> 00:22:41,987
Look at your compass.

246
00:22:48,663 --> 00:22:50,824
Where the hell are we?

247
00:22:50,898 --> 00:22:53,890
- Do I look like your travel agent?
- Fine.

248
00:22:53,968 --> 00:22:55,799
Okay...

249
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:57,461
I give up.

250
00:22:58,139 --> 00:22:59,436
What's going on?

251
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:01,236
I don't know.

252
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,810
But what if all the legends
were true?

253
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,642
What legends?

254
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,910
Do you need help with those?

255
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:47,855
Ah, no more steps.

256
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:56,432
Great! Can't wait
to see the bathrooms.

257
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:23,550
You know?

258
00:24:24,495 --> 00:24:26,690
When a woman looks at you like that...

259
00:24:26,763 --> 00:24:28,788
it usually means something.

260
00:24:39,443 --> 00:24:41,604
Princess Kitana.

261
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,409
She's our most dangerous adversary.

262
00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:48,075
Watch her carefully, Reptile.

263
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,418
Keep her away from these humans.

264
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:12,302
Welcome.

265
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:14,897
You're here to compete in...

266
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:16,533
Mortal Kombat.

267
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,546
Tomorrow morning the great
combat begins.

268
00:26:20,614 --> 00:26:23,139
Some will have the distinct honor...

269
00:26:23,216 --> 00:26:25,684
and pleasure...

270
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:29,189
to face Prince Goro...

271
00:26:30,124 --> 00:26:31,751
our reigning champion.

272
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:35,658
You are witnesses to a great
turning point in the history...

273
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:37,663
of your planet.

274
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:40,966
Treasure these moments...

275
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,761
as if they were your last.

276
00:26:46,207 --> 00:26:48,971
Now, for a taste of things to come...

277
00:28:05,355 --> 00:28:08,119
Flawless victory.

278
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:19,800
"Come to a little tournament," he said.
"Be good for the career," he said.

279
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,667
Yeah, right.

280
00:28:21,739 --> 00:28:22,728
Liu.

281
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:27,102
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.

282
00:28:27,178 --> 00:28:31,137
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?

283
00:28:31,216 --> 00:28:35,016
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.

284
00:28:36,187 --> 00:28:38,781
You know, you've got to admire her.

285
00:28:38,856 --> 00:28:42,087
When she sets her mind on something...

286
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,424
It's not her mind you're admiring.

287
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:47,891
True.

288
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:28,029
How many times must I tell you?
I don't need your help.

289
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,041
I can take care of myself.

290
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,170
We can't help it.
It's a guy thing.

291
00:29:33,247 --> 00:29:36,148
- Where are you going?
- I'm following him.

292
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:39,309
- I work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.

293
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,117
Let's forget about Shang.

294
00:29:42,189 --> 00:29:43,952
Forget about him?

295
00:29:44,023 --> 00:29:47,550
I want to get to the bottom of this.

296
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:49,562
Are you out of your mind?

297
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,509
Sonya...

298
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:10,812
You go ahead. Find out
what that was.

299
00:30:10,885 --> 00:30:13,479
Liu and I'll wait right here.

300
00:30:13,555 --> 00:30:14,783
What?

301
00:30:21,062 --> 00:30:24,190
See, me... I believe
in a fair fight.

302
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,699
You know, one-on-one,
man-to-man...

303
00:30:26,768 --> 00:30:30,135
hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.

304
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:33,002
But what I just saw
wasn't very fair.

305
00:30:33,074 --> 00:30:35,269
That's Kano.

306
00:30:35,344 --> 00:30:37,403
Forget about Kano.

307
00:30:37,478 --> 00:30:38,968
Who's the other guy?

308
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:42,039
Then he freezes this guy, right?

309
00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:45,882
And then he explodes.
I could see his guts and everything.

310
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,223
Almost lost my lunch.

311
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:52,453
Disgusting.

312
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:57,525
What I want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great...

313
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,626
how come he's got such a
crummy looking boat?

314
00:31:01,837 --> 00:31:04,499
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.

315
00:31:04,574 --> 00:31:08,340
"Treasure these moments".

316
00:31:11,213 --> 00:31:14,410
That was his intention.

317
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:17,748
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.

318
00:31:17,821 --> 00:31:20,085
The wise cultivate his favor.

319
00:31:21,156 --> 00:31:23,056
Those who challenge his power...

320
00:31:23,126 --> 00:31:25,356
become his slaves.

321
00:31:26,196 --> 00:31:27,925
Yeah?

322
00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:30,091
I haven't seen any of them around.

323
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:32,225
You fool!

324
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:34,929
You know nothing.

325
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:37,802
He enslaves souls.

326
00:31:37,874 --> 00:31:42,368
He learned the black arts
from the Emperor himself.

327
00:31:43,346 --> 00:31:45,712
You're some kind of royalty too...

328
00:31:45,783 --> 00:31:48,274
- right?
- I am Goro!

329
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:51,286
General of the armies
of Outworld and prince...

330
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:54,620
of the subterranean realm of Shokan.

331
00:31:54,691 --> 00:31:56,682
Subterranean?

332
00:31:56,727 --> 00:31:59,355
What's that,
something like underground?

333
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:01,863
Yes, something like...

334
00:32:01,932 --> 00:32:02,899
that.

335
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:05,834
I'm kind of an underworld boss.

336
00:32:06,804 --> 00:32:09,432
Well... I mean, back home.

337
00:32:10,408 --> 00:32:12,308
How lucky for them...

338
00:32:12,376 --> 00:32:14,310
"back home".

339
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:17,639
It's true...

340
00:32:18,282 --> 00:32:19,772
Prince Goro.

341
00:32:21,318 --> 00:32:26,221
Why else would I have chosen
such a disreputable looking cretin?

342
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:28,151
Look at him.

343
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,757
No dignity...

344
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:32,319
no manners.

345
00:32:32,397 --> 00:32:36,333
Yet in the realm of Earth...

346
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:38,995
such men can amass great wealth...

347
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:41,470
and almost godlike power.

348
00:32:45,243 --> 00:32:49,942
I'd get back to my amassing
as soon as possible, if you don't mind.

349
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:52,108
Now, when do I get paid?

350
00:32:52,185 --> 00:32:55,643
After you've fought the girl.
But remember...

351
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:58,815
she's not to be harmed,
only humiliated.

352
00:33:00,126 --> 00:33:02,788
I have plans for my beautiful Sonya.

353
00:33:05,598 --> 00:33:10,058
To what do we owe the honor
of your visit, Shang Tsung?

354
00:33:10,136 --> 00:33:14,800
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant
is competing in the tournament.

355
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:19,344
- Handle him carefully.
- I saw this Liu Kang in the hall.

356
00:33:19,446 --> 00:33:22,210
He'll pose no problem.

357
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:25,045
This is no time for
foolish pride.

358
00:33:26,353 --> 00:33:28,719
We've never been
so close to victory.

359
00:33:28,788 --> 00:33:32,053
Which is why I've come
to warn you of another danger.

360
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,358
Princess Kitana.

361
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:39,297
The Emperor's adopted daughter?

362
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:41,561
Why should I worry about her?

363
00:33:41,635 --> 00:33:44,832
Princess Kitana
is 10,000 years old...

364
00:33:44,938 --> 00:33:47,566
and the rightful heir to the
throne of Outworld.

365
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:51,167
She must not join the forces
from the Realm of Earth...

366
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:53,712
especially Liu Kang.

367
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:57,276
What's so special about you?

368
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,581
I don't know.

369
00:33:59,654 --> 00:34:02,088
The Emperor will not
tolerate failure...

370
00:34:03,557 --> 00:34:06,424
and neither will I.

371
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:09,463
I do not fail.

372
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:11,431
Let's get out of here.

373
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,498
What? What is it?

374
00:34:17,606 --> 00:34:20,666
We are not alone.

375
00:34:28,116 --> 00:34:30,311
Wait a second,
I don't remember this.

376
00:34:36,724 --> 00:34:37,782
Look!

377
00:34:40,262 --> 00:34:42,492
That has to be Princess Kitana.

378
00:34:42,565 --> 00:34:44,829
She's trying to help us.

379
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,198
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.

380
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:49,567
Forget her. She's 10,000 years old.

381
00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:51,697
- So what?
- Liu?

382
00:35:40,191 --> 00:35:42,887
- What happened?
- There's something here.

383
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,053
It's following Princess Kitana.

384
00:35:45,129 --> 00:35:47,256
Where is she?

385
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:48,491
I don't know.

386
00:35:55,606 --> 00:35:59,736
- Where are we going?
- I know exactly where we're going.

387
00:35:59,844 --> 00:36:01,778
Kitana went this way.

388
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:07,383
I can smell her perfume.

389
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:10,855
I don't smell anything.

390
00:36:16,161 --> 00:36:17,685
I smell something.

391
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:22,232
Bullshit.

392
00:36:35,615 --> 00:36:37,048
We got company.

393
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,374
Just the way I like them.

394
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:36,636
Dumb and ugly.

395
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:39,577
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?

396
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:42,741
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.

397
00:37:42,851 --> 00:37:45,615
What is it with you guys?

398
00:37:45,687 --> 00:37:48,485
We're standing...
they're not.

399
00:37:48,556 --> 00:37:50,490
What more do you want?

400
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:01,932
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

401
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:07,634
So, why don't you show me
what you plan to do about...

402
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:08,767
them?

403
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:23,925
I don't think so.

404
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,634
You'll find that this
is the way out.

405
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:53,585
You guys are lucky he stopped us.

406
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:07,533
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?

407
00:39:07,604 --> 00:39:10,539
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?

408
00:39:10,607 --> 00:39:12,472
If he chooses to.

409
00:39:12,543 --> 00:39:15,171
As a former champion
he has the right to do so.

410
00:39:15,246 --> 00:39:19,273
And he's far more dangerous
than Goro.

411
00:39:19,382 --> 00:39:23,409
His power comes from the souls
of vanquished warriors.

412
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:25,489
To fight Shang Tsung...

413
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,558
is to face not one...

414
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:29,888
but a legion of adversaries.

415
00:39:29,961 --> 00:39:31,588
Remember that.

416
00:39:36,301 --> 00:39:38,895
Tomorrow the tournament begins.

417
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,429
Be prepared.

418
00:39:56,321 --> 00:39:58,186
From this moment on...

419
00:39:58,257 --> 00:40:01,522
my island will be your battleground.

420
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:05,390
Liu Kang!

421
00:40:05,464 --> 00:40:07,694
You will be first.

422
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:10,327
Let Mortal Kombat begin.

423
00:40:22,515 --> 00:40:23,948
- Let's go!
- Yes!

424
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:20,961
Your soul is mine.

425
00:42:34,384 --> 00:42:36,147
Fatality.

426
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:00,439
Sonya Blade!

427
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,739
I have something for you, my dear.

428
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:07,649
I don't want anything from you.

429
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,085
On the contrary.

430
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:13,851
I have something you want very much.

431
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,017
You can thank me later.

432
00:43:35,547 --> 00:43:37,310
Hello, baby.

433
00:43:37,383 --> 00:43:39,283
Did you miss me?

434
00:43:56,402 --> 00:43:58,427
Now look at this.

435
00:43:58,504 --> 00:44:01,268
This little baby
brings back memories, doesn't it?

436
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,968
You used it to knife your mother
in the back?

437
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:09,145
It put a big smile on your
partner, though. Ear...

438
00:44:11,384 --> 00:44:12,976
to ear...

439
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:20,315
Give it up. I've studied
all your moves.

440
00:44:20,427 --> 00:44:21,451
Study this.

441
00:45:01,202 --> 00:45:03,067
Does it hurt, baby?

442
00:45:22,724 --> 00:45:24,419
Right. Finish him.

443
00:45:25,627 --> 00:45:27,686
No, Sonya. Don't!

444
00:45:28,997 --> 00:45:31,329
- Give me a break!
- Okay.

445
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,833
Get over here!

446
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,497
Come here!

447
00:47:40,533 --> 00:47:41,761
Welcome!

448
00:49:30,413 --> 00:49:32,005
Get down here!

449
00:50:54,432 --> 00:50:57,868
"To my Greatest Fan
Johnny Cage"

450
00:51:48,722 --> 00:51:50,155
Begin!

451
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,696
Fight with all of your heart
or there is no hope.

452
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:04,533
Why do you care if I win?

453
00:52:19,621 --> 00:52:23,614
To win your next match,
use the element which brings life.

454
00:52:23,691 --> 00:52:24,749
What?

455
00:52:24,826 --> 00:52:25,884
Kitana!

456
00:52:37,406 --> 00:52:39,670
Remember my words.

457
00:52:39,775 --> 00:52:41,800
That's enough!

458
00:52:43,412 --> 00:52:45,471
You disappoint me.

459
00:52:47,316 --> 00:52:49,011
Not very wise.

460
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,587
Use the element which brings life.

461
00:55:43,196 --> 00:55:44,629
Water.

462
00:56:21,802 --> 00:56:23,269
Is it time?

463
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:26,230
Yes.

464
00:56:26,308 --> 00:56:28,742
We've let these humans win enough.

465
00:56:30,078 --> 00:56:32,638
At last.

466
00:57:27,238 --> 00:57:28,398
What the...?

467
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,551
Yeah, that's it! In and out!

468
00:57:54,732 --> 00:57:56,165
Come on. You can do it!

469
00:57:56,234 --> 00:57:57,724
Move! Use your feet.

470
00:57:58,603 --> 00:57:59,934
Kick him!

471
00:58:12,184 --> 00:58:15,051
Come on, Art. Get up!

472
00:58:26,632 --> 00:58:27,599
Get out!

473
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:30,491
Finish him.

474
00:58:32,171 --> 00:58:33,069
Get out!

475
00:58:43,483 --> 00:58:45,348
Goro! Goro!

476
00:58:45,452 --> 00:58:47,647
Yes! Goro!

477
00:59:06,373 --> 00:59:07,499
Finish him!

478
00:59:11,778 --> 00:59:14,542
Time to die.

479
00:59:14,614 --> 00:59:15,581
Finish him.

480
00:59:54,723 --> 00:59:56,918
Flawless victory.

481
00:59:57,025 --> 01:00:00,688
Your soul is mine!

482
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:20,573
We can't win!

483
01:00:20,649 --> 01:00:23,777
How can we possibly beat
something like that?

484
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:26,481
Good question.

485
01:00:26,588 --> 01:00:29,614
Goro can be killed.

486
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:34,288
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed
by mortal men and women.

487
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:38,865
You can overcome any adversary...

488
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:42,803
no matter how bizarre
their powers may seem.

489
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:45,636
There is always a way.

490
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:50,007
Only one thing can defeat you:

491
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,240
Your own fear.

492
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,545
So, who says we're afraid?

493
01:00:56,287 --> 01:00:58,983
You must first face your fears...

494
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:01,991
if you are to conquer them.

495
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:05,425
You, Johnny, are afraid
you're a fake...

496
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:09,592
so you'll rush into any fight
just to prove you're not.

497
01:01:11,702 --> 01:01:13,499
You'll fight...

498
01:01:13,571 --> 01:01:15,436
bravely enough...

499
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:17,235
but foolishly...

500
01:01:17,308 --> 01:01:19,242
carelessly...

501
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:21,403
and you'll be beaten.

502
01:01:24,415 --> 01:01:27,179
You, Sonya...

503
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:31,187
are afraid to admit even you
sometimes need help.

504
01:01:35,659 --> 01:01:38,423
If you are afraid to trust...

505
01:01:39,264 --> 01:01:41,528
you will lose.

506
01:01:48,406 --> 01:01:49,839
Wait.

507
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:51,542
Wait.

508
01:01:52,811 --> 01:01:53,903
What about me?

509
01:01:53,979 --> 01:01:56,504
Oh, you.

510
01:01:56,581 --> 01:01:59,243
You fear your own destiny.

511
01:01:59,317 --> 01:02:02,912
You already fled once
when you went to America, so...

512
01:02:02,988 --> 01:02:05,081
you're guilty about Chan's death.

513
01:02:05,156 --> 01:02:07,283
I am responsible for Chan's death.

514
01:02:07,392 --> 01:02:11,726
Every mortal is responsible
for his own destiny.

515
01:02:11,797 --> 01:02:14,425
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?

516
01:02:16,235 --> 01:02:17,463
I tried.

517
01:02:17,537 --> 01:02:20,301
Despair is the most dangerous fear.

518
01:02:20,373 --> 01:02:22,364
I know this...

519
01:02:22,441 --> 01:02:24,636
and so does Shang Tsung.

520
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:27,577
He can peer into your soul...

521
01:02:27,647 --> 01:02:30,309
and use the fear he sees against you.

522
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:33,412
You must be prepared.

523
01:02:56,977 --> 01:02:59,309
Liu!

524
01:02:59,379 --> 01:03:01,904
You will be next.

525
01:03:14,562 --> 01:03:17,429
Goro's never been beaten.

526
01:03:17,498 --> 01:03:19,728
You go up against him,
he'll kill you.

527
01:03:19,801 --> 01:03:21,234
If I don't...

528
01:03:21,302 --> 01:03:24,066
then he'll finish us off
one at a time.

529
01:03:25,608 --> 01:03:27,542
If I challenge him now...

530
01:03:28,443 --> 01:03:31,037
I can finish this.

531
01:03:31,112 --> 01:03:34,013
You're making this sound simple
and it isn't.

532
01:03:34,082 --> 01:03:35,709
Yeah, it is.

533
01:03:37,086 --> 01:03:40,783
'Cause I can't let what happened
to Art happen to you.

534
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:44,881
Not to you.

535
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,726
Oh, don't you dare do this
to protect me, Johnny Cage.

536
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:51,424
Trust me. I've a plan.

537
01:03:51,533 --> 01:03:54,934
I don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical...

538
01:03:55,004 --> 01:03:57,802
self-deluded person I have ever met.

539
01:03:57,874 --> 01:03:59,865
You forgot "good looking. "

540
01:04:05,981 --> 01:04:08,950
Challenging Goro, eh?

541
01:04:09,018 --> 01:04:12,112
You weren't supposed
to fight him now.

542
01:04:12,188 --> 01:04:14,713
Are you that eager to die?

543
01:04:14,791 --> 01:04:16,315
I'm not the one who'll die.

544
01:04:19,729 --> 01:04:21,162
I see.

545
01:04:21,965 --> 01:04:23,626
You're very foolish.

546
01:04:23,733 --> 01:04:26,497
The true sign of a hero.

547
01:04:26,569 --> 01:04:28,696
You want to protect your friends.

548
01:04:28,772 --> 01:04:31,366
But make no mistake.

549
01:04:32,409 --> 01:04:34,741
They too will die...

550
01:04:34,811 --> 01:04:37,507
after Goro destroys you.

551
01:04:37,581 --> 01:04:40,049
So what's the problem?

552
01:04:41,117 --> 01:04:43,176
As you wish.

553
01:04:43,253 --> 01:04:47,417
As absurd as your request is,
I shall grant it.

554
01:04:47,491 --> 01:04:52,428
In return I reserve the right
to challenge the winner myself.

555
01:04:52,496 --> 01:04:55,192
Or another of my choosing.

556
01:04:55,299 --> 01:04:59,235
In a place designated by me
for the final battle...

557
01:04:59,336 --> 01:05:00,894
of the tournament.

558
01:05:02,373 --> 01:05:04,967
- You got it, pal.
- I don't think so.

559
01:05:09,214 --> 01:05:11,478
Too late, Lord Rayden.

560
01:05:12,483 --> 01:05:14,576
The rules are quite clear.

561
01:05:15,554 --> 01:05:17,454
It's... How do you say?

562
01:05:18,857 --> 01:05:21,121
"A deal's a deal. "

563
01:05:26,697 --> 01:05:28,164
What have you done?

564
01:05:28,233 --> 01:05:30,531
I made a choice.

565
01:05:30,602 --> 01:05:32,934
This is our tournament, remember?

566
01:05:33,004 --> 01:05:34,403
Mortal Kombat.

567
01:05:34,473 --> 01:05:36,407
We fight it.

568
01:05:43,249 --> 01:05:44,876
Good.

569
01:05:44,951 --> 01:05:47,818
At last one of them has understood.

570
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:53,288
Goro! Goro!

571
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:58,988
Finish him quickly.

572
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,721
Pay me my tribute.

573
01:07:00,795 --> 01:07:04,356
This puny mortal
will be no problem.

574
01:07:04,432 --> 01:07:06,696
I'll crush him in one blow.

575
01:07:06,802 --> 01:07:08,360
Alright.

576
01:07:09,504 --> 01:07:10,630
Let's dance.

577
01:07:20,715 --> 01:07:23,411
Yes! Sorry.

578
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:30,555
You imbecile.

579
01:07:34,597 --> 01:07:36,622
Damn, that hurt.

580
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:38,632
Follow him.

581
01:07:38,701 --> 01:07:39,690
Finish him.

582
01:07:45,609 --> 01:07:48,077
- Yes! Yes!
- Goro! Goro!

583
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:53,078
Finish him! Finish him!

584
01:08:31,122 --> 01:08:33,613
Those were $500 sunglasses,
asshole.

585
01:08:53,277 --> 01:08:55,142
This is where you fall down.

586
01:09:10,228 --> 01:09:12,822
Let me go!

587
01:09:13,865 --> 01:09:15,093
Stop!

588
01:09:17,169 --> 01:09:20,798
I hereby exercise my right
to challenge.

589
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:23,204
I challenge her.

590
01:09:23,308 --> 01:09:25,708
You're a coward, sorcerer.

591
01:09:25,778 --> 01:09:27,211
Stand and fight.

592
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:29,747
We had a deal, remember?

593
01:09:29,848 --> 01:09:32,817
Mortal Kombat continues.
I'm simply...

594
01:09:32,885 --> 01:09:34,819
changing the place...

595
01:09:36,956 --> 01:09:39,220
as we agreed.

596
01:09:42,061 --> 01:09:43,995
- Sonya!
- Wait!

597
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,467
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle...

598
01:09:50,537 --> 01:09:53,904
in the wastelands of Outworld,
where I cannot follow.

599
01:09:54,007 --> 01:09:55,941
We can.

600
01:09:56,010 --> 01:09:59,673
Rayden... Can Sonya
beat Shang Tsung?

601
01:10:01,414 --> 01:10:02,642
I'm sorry.

602
01:10:02,716 --> 01:10:05,344
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.

603
01:10:05,419 --> 01:10:07,683
Neglected to mention it.

604
01:10:07,754 --> 01:10:11,747
She must accept the challenge
or there'll be no final combat.

605
01:10:11,825 --> 01:10:15,761
I have nothing further
to teach you, Liu Kang.

606
01:10:15,829 --> 01:10:17,592
You possess the knowledge.

607
01:10:17,664 --> 01:10:21,293
All that is lacking now is the will.

608
01:10:21,369 --> 01:10:23,564
You sure you don't want to go?

609
01:10:23,637 --> 01:10:26,401
In Outworld, if you look
hard enough...

610
01:10:26,474 --> 01:10:28,442
you will find another guide.

611
01:10:38,052 --> 01:10:39,349
Good luck.

612
01:10:50,432 --> 01:10:52,161
They'll need it.

613
01:10:55,136 --> 01:10:57,297
This is not good.

614
01:10:57,372 --> 01:10:59,704
But I'm fine.

615
01:10:59,809 --> 01:11:01,868
I can deal with this.

616
01:11:05,247 --> 01:11:08,705
So... this is Outworld.

617
01:11:08,818 --> 01:11:11,582
I can see why they want
a change of scenery.

618
01:11:11,653 --> 01:11:13,746
We should head for that tower.

619
01:11:13,823 --> 01:11:16,087
He'd have taken Sonya there.

620
01:11:36,746 --> 01:11:38,407
I hate this place.

621
01:11:38,515 --> 01:11:41,507
I do. I'm telling you I hate it.

622
01:11:41,618 --> 01:11:44,314
A hostile environment,
I'm unprepared...

623
01:11:44,387 --> 01:11:47,083
with people who want to kick my ass.

624
01:11:47,157 --> 01:11:49,523
It's like being back in high school!

625
01:11:50,994 --> 01:11:52,757
What's that?

626
01:11:54,264 --> 01:11:55,629
Wait.

627
01:11:56,199 --> 01:11:57,598
What?

628
01:11:58,236 --> 01:12:00,170
There's something else.

629
01:12:00,237 --> 01:12:01,670
Oh, great.

630
01:12:05,909 --> 01:12:07,501
What are you doing?

631
01:12:12,349 --> 01:12:13,611
What are you doing?

632
01:12:44,248 --> 01:12:45,681
Reptile.

633
01:15:45,336 --> 01:15:47,270
Oh no, you don't.

634
01:15:55,312 --> 01:15:56,904
Well done.

635
01:15:59,717 --> 01:16:02,049
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.

636
01:16:02,153 --> 01:16:03,586
Kitana.

637
01:16:04,255 --> 01:16:05,483
Come with me.

638
01:16:08,359 --> 01:16:10,293
What happened here?

639
01:16:11,462 --> 01:16:14,829
The same thing that will happen
to your world...

640
01:16:14,899 --> 01:16:16,992
unless you prevent it.

641
01:16:19,405 --> 01:16:23,307
My father was the rightful ruler
of Outworld

642
01:16:25,243 --> 01:16:28,940
Then his best warriors
lost ten Mortal Kombats...

643
01:16:29,013 --> 01:16:31,538
and the Emperor entered the Realm...

644
01:16:31,616 --> 01:16:34,210
killed my parents and adopted me...

645
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:36,378
to lay claim to the throne.

646
01:16:41,026 --> 01:16:43,153
But it was beautiful once...

647
01:16:43,228 --> 01:16:47,324
before Shang Tsung engineered
its destruction.

648
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:50,527
How can I stop this from happening
in my world?

649
01:16:50,603 --> 01:16:52,935
If I did not believe in you...

650
01:16:53,006 --> 01:16:54,871
I would not have helped you.

651
01:16:56,608 --> 01:16:59,839
In the Black Tower you will face
three challenges.

652
01:16:59,913 --> 01:17:03,542
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.

653
01:17:03,616 --> 01:17:06,710
And you must face your worst fear.

654
01:18:22,899 --> 01:18:26,027
I will not fight you, Shang Tsung.

655
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:28,899
I am not playing your game.

656
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,007
My sweet Sonya.

657
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:35,043
There's no one else.

658
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:37,135
If you don't fight...

659
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:39,738
the Realm of Earth will
forfeit the Tournament...

660
01:18:40,783 --> 01:18:42,774
and its portals will open...

661
01:18:42,852 --> 01:18:45,616
to our great Emperor.

662
01:18:45,688 --> 01:18:47,451
You're lying.

663
01:18:48,424 --> 01:18:50,324
My friends will come for me.

664
01:18:51,661 --> 01:18:53,458
Hoping against hope.

665
01:18:53,529 --> 01:18:57,727
Such an endearing human trait.
I'm touched. Really.

666
01:18:59,803 --> 01:19:02,203
One last chance, Sonya.

667
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:04,239
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.

668
01:19:04,308 --> 01:19:06,105
Go to hell.

669
01:19:07,678 --> 01:19:09,441
Take her away.

670
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,744
The Emperor will be overjoyed.

671
01:19:15,786 --> 01:19:17,447
My friends will come.

672
01:19:20,791 --> 01:19:22,088
They're already here.

673
01:19:24,795 --> 01:19:27,764
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.

674
01:19:29,066 --> 01:19:32,035
Will you dare interfere
with the tournament...

675
01:19:32,102 --> 01:19:34,696
and betray our Emperor?

676
01:19:34,772 --> 01:19:38,230
In his great wisdom, he knows
that Mortal Kombat...

677
01:19:38,308 --> 01:19:40,242
cannot be won by treachery.

678
01:19:40,311 --> 01:19:43,610
How dare you speak to me
of treachery?

679
01:19:43,681 --> 01:19:47,617
Your ignorance will lose forever...

680
01:19:47,685 --> 01:19:50,017
the keys to the Realm of Earth.

681
01:19:51,055 --> 01:19:52,647
Very well.

682
01:19:57,228 --> 01:19:59,162
I challenge you.

683
01:20:00,832 --> 01:20:02,766
You'll fight me.

684
01:20:08,107 --> 01:20:09,802
I am Liu Kang...

685
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:12,309
descendant of Kung Lao.

686
01:20:13,244 --> 01:20:16,145
I challenge you to Mortal Kombat.

687
01:20:16,215 --> 01:20:19,048
Do you accept or yield?

688
01:20:20,886 --> 01:20:23,150
I accept.

689
01:20:24,524 --> 01:20:25,957
Leave us.

690
01:20:29,194 --> 01:20:30,957
I will take care...

691
01:20:31,064 --> 01:20:34,033
of this impudent mortal myself.

692
01:20:47,781 --> 01:20:49,715
Nice dress.

693
01:21:57,719 --> 01:21:59,653
You fool.

694
01:22:10,533 --> 01:22:12,262
What's that noise?

695
01:22:12,367 --> 01:22:15,359
The source of all
Shang Tsung's power.

696
01:22:15,471 --> 01:22:17,496
The souls of 1000 dead warriors.

697
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,672
Face your enemy.

698
01:23:52,036 --> 01:23:54,163
Is that all you've got, sorcerer?

699
01:23:55,674 --> 01:23:57,266
Liu Kang!

700
01:23:58,611 --> 01:24:01,307
I can see into your soul.

701
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:05,009
You will die.

702
01:24:08,954 --> 01:24:10,581
Face yourself.

703
01:24:10,656 --> 01:24:14,183
You can look into my soul...

704
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:16,125
but you don't own it.

705
01:24:27,841 --> 01:24:29,866
Face your worst fear.

706
01:24:29,976 --> 01:24:32,308
I'm not afraid of my destiny.

707
01:24:32,379 --> 01:24:33,812
Face me.

708
01:24:38,685 --> 01:24:39,674
Liu.

709
01:24:42,322 --> 01:24:43,380
Chan?

710
01:24:46,494 --> 01:24:47,791
It can't be you.

711
01:24:50,196 --> 01:24:52,130
Rayden sent me.

712
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:54,357
To help you.

713
01:24:54,468 --> 01:24:56,299
You're not really Chan.

714
01:24:58,705 --> 01:25:01,071
Remember when our parents died?

715
01:25:04,211 --> 01:25:06,873
You promised you'd always
take care of me?

716
01:25:10,584 --> 01:25:11,846
I remember.

717
01:25:13,587 --> 01:25:15,851
It's my turn to take care of you.

718
01:25:22,563 --> 01:25:23,825
Come with me.

719
01:25:28,903 --> 01:25:30,427
I forgive you for letting me die.

720
01:25:35,911 --> 01:25:37,435
It wasn't my fault.

721
01:25:39,948 --> 01:25:41,438
- Brother.
- No.

722
01:25:43,919 --> 01:25:46,012
Chan chose his own path.

723
01:25:47,289 --> 01:25:50,190
Every man is responsible
for his own destiny.

724
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:53,594
Shang Tsung killed my brother.

725
01:25:55,597 --> 01:25:56,757
You're mine.

726
01:26:23,426 --> 01:26:25,860
The Chosen One.

727
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:46,846
I am The Chosen One.

728
01:26:55,894 --> 01:26:57,987
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?

729
01:27:01,932 --> 01:27:05,663
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.

730
01:27:06,538 --> 01:27:08,028
Free them.

731
01:27:09,807 --> 01:27:13,709
They are mine forever.

732
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:31,796
All those souls,
and you don't have your own.

733
01:27:31,863 --> 01:27:33,558
I pity you, sorcerer.

734
01:27:36,601 --> 01:27:39,468
Save your pity for the weak.

735
01:27:39,538 --> 01:27:40,562
Surrender!

736
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:56,188
Never!

737
01:28:35,463 --> 01:28:37,590
Flawless victory.

738
01:29:23,478 --> 01:29:24,945
I knew you'd come.

739
01:29:25,881 --> 01:29:27,314
Chan.

740
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:32,285
One day...

741
01:29:32,354 --> 01:29:34,288
we will be reunited...

742
01:29:36,426 --> 01:29:39,987
but until then my spirit
will always be with you.

743
01:29:42,465 --> 01:29:44,365
Go in peace, my brother.

744
01:30:24,742 --> 01:30:26,835
Let's go home...

745
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,825
I've been waiting for you.

746
01:30:50,902 --> 01:30:53,132
What took you so long?

747
01:30:53,204 --> 01:30:55,900
I guess you knew it would
end this way.

748
01:30:56,708 --> 01:30:58,039
Didn't have a clue.

749
01:31:00,478 --> 01:31:03,276
You humans are so unpredictable.

750
01:31:05,083 --> 01:31:08,519
I must tell you something...
you guys did great.

751
01:31:10,822 --> 01:31:14,519
- Bow to me!
- What is it?

752
01:31:16,027 --> 01:31:17,619
The Emperor.

753
01:31:23,402 --> 01:31:27,338
You weak, pathetic fools.
I've come for your souls.

754
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:29,664
I don't think so.
