00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,743
Ernesto, could you takes us with you, please

18
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:04,425
Look dad, I'm sorry, but no matter how
many times you tell me...

19
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:06,979
Please Ernesto, you are only 3 assignments
away from your MD title

20
00:02:07,473 --> 00:02:08,818
And that can wait

<i>Final Destination: the Peninsula of Guajira in Venezuela
at the north point of the continent</i>

31
00:02:57,906 --> 00:03:03,204
We settle at the Peninsula of Guajira, the point of this great continent

32
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,417
Mouths full of wine, nice music

33
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:07,769
That beer is good, ah?

34
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:12,051
- Fuser, on January 4th, you should be done with all your exams, right?
- Yes

35
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:18,651
- If you want, i can make a detour to Miramar to visit your little girlfriend
- "little girlfriend"

36
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,701
A couple of days

37
00:03:23,018 --> 00:03:26,794
- Look Fuser, look at that guy over there
- What?

38
00:03:27,363 --> 00:03:29,130
Do you want your life to be like that?

39
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:32,865
You don't want your life to be like that, Fuser

40
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:36,164
What you want is to fuck in every country in South America

41
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,858
Hey boy...and in every town if we are lucky enough
That's and extra ingredient, right

42
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,325
<i>What we had in common: our restlessness, our dreaming spirit</i>

43
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:49,857

BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA
January 4th, 1952
Km 0

45
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:55,035
Let's go Ernestito, we don't have the whole day

46
00:03:55,592 --> 00:04:00,054
- Isn't it too much Granado?
- Not enough chief.  Norton 500, "this" is a motorcycle

47
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:03,144
Your son is in good wheels, don't worry

48
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:10,955
You should expect some difficult times son

49
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:14,653
But the truth is that i always dreamed of doing something like this

50
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:19,794
And i have to confess that if i had a couple less years on me...
I would jump right along with you on that motorcycle

51
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:21,732
Try to think that i do it for the both of us

52
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,191
- 10 years planning this trip, uncle
- Since you were a kid

53
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:29,169
Meanwhile...I trust you eh?

54
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:32,475
And the revolution uncle, for when?

55
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:34,951
Here? In a century

56
00:04:37,655 --> 00:04:40,198
- Are you already leaving?
- Yes, I’m off

57
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,862
You should only worry about taking your medicines, nothing more, ok?

58
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:48,927
And writing me...

59
00:04:49,236 --> 00:04:52,489
The most beautiful letters you have ever read mom

60
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:55,032
- Bye, my love
- You'll see. Bye. I love you

61
00:04:59,352 --> 00:04:59,909
Bye

62
00:05:01,446 --> 00:05:03,774
Bye little sister, take care

63
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:06,016
Bye man

64
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:16,273
Send me postcards

65
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,070
Ok, stop it or I’ll start crying. Please

66
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:20,632
Take care, ok?

67
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:25,144
Just like Don Quixote had Rocinante and Saint Martin had his mule

68
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:27,035
We have "La Poderosa"

69
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:32,036
- Yeah, that pisses oil
- Yes, pisses oil, but what I’m trying to say is that
in this precise moment

70
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:37,397
The young Fuser and myself are embarking in a trip
to the most remote places of the human spirit

71
00:05:37,642 --> 00:05:41,449
where we will meet new lands, listen to new anthems, eat new fruits...

72
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:47,299
Granado...I’m making you responsible. If something happens to Ernesto I’ll find you.
Put on the handkerchief darling

73
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,936
Don't worry mam, he will come back to become
the doctor we all want him to be

74
00:05:50,953 --> 00:05:52,281
It better be

75
00:05:52,616 --> 00:05:54,408
Ok, is time to leave!

76
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:15,485
Animal!

77
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:23,076
Careful with that bike!

78
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:39,899
<i>Dear mom...Buenos Aires is behind us</i>

79
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:42,178
<i>behind is as also the miserable life</i>

80
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,104
<i>the faculty, the exams and the dissertations that make you sleepy</i>

81
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,875
<i>Before us lies all of Latin America</i>

82
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:52,134
<i>From now on we will only trust in "La Poderosa"</i>

83
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:19,667
<i>I wish you could see us. We look like adventurers
and inspire admiration and envy everywhere</i>

84
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:36,192
Go Mial. Assume aerodynamic road position

85
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:40,050
C'mon baby, don't fail me baby.
C'mon, c'mon

86
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,283
What happened Mial?!

87
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:56,457
<i>I'm glad to have left behind civilization, and be closer to the earth</i>

88
00:07:58,174 --> 00:08:01,692
Wait, something is coming out...something is coming out

89
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:08,850
Fuser, are you alright?

90
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:13,983
What happened puppy?

91
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,073
Are you alright?

92
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:25,405
- What the fuck is that?
- What the fuck does it look like?

93
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:28,449
- A fucking dog?!
-  Oh fuck, you are a shitty driver...

94
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,134
What the fuck is that dog doing on the bike?

95
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:33,342
Is for Chichina and his name is Kamba

96
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:38,000
Pick up the bike.

97
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:53,753
Miramar, Argentina
January 13th, 1952
Km 601

98
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,248
Where the fuck are we? Switzerland?

99
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:06,739
- Good morning
- Good morning

100
00:09:07,073 --> 00:09:09,437
- Chichina?
- She's inside with the rest of the family

101
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:12,639
That bike is giving you problems, uh?

102
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,574
Esteban, please tell us about your trip

103
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,172
It was great Don Horacio,
i had the opportunity to take a seminar in Cambridge

104
00:09:24,406 --> 00:09:27,426
and stay a couple of weeks in London,
a fascinating city

105
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,440
- What a privilege!
- Yes it was

106
00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:33,615
-  Esteban is getting his PhD soon, right?
- Yes

107
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:37,219
- Medicine?
- No, Law

108
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,329
Ah, law

109
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:18,202
Sorry.

110
00:10:37,124 --> 00:10:39,153
1, 2, 3, 4

111
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:42,079
Is your turn, come

112
00:10:42,651 --> 00:10:44,570
I never saw a pig who wanted to dance, never.

113
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:47,674
C'mon

114
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:49,358
Knock it off!

115
00:10:51,628 --> 00:10:58,582
- With this hand...back...side
- What are you laughing at?
- I'm laughing at you.

116
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:07,758
Tonight?

117
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:10,880
My dad ask aunt Roxanna not to take her eyes off of me

118
00:11:11,242 --> 00:11:16,109
My mom promised the Lady of the Valley that she would
walk to her sanctuary if we broke up

119
00:11:17,562 --> 00:11:23,227
And your parents can't see that the more they bury the diamonds,
the more decided is the pirate to steal them?

120
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,385
Believe me, this diamond wouldn't mind being stolen

121
00:11:31,978 --> 00:11:33,269
Dance

122
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:41,404
Look

123
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:54,736
Let me see your bathroom

124
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:01,547
- Good night
- Good night ladies

125
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,531
Aunt Roxanna, which room is mine?

126
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:26,518
Get away Kamba!

127
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,351
- How many days did you say we were staying here?
- You already know
- Two

128
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:21,582
- And how many days have we been here?
- If you become a Doctor, will you operate with wire too?
- Six days, Fuser

129
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:27,352
Someone will see us

130
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:49,376
If you'd stay we could do many things, Ernesto,
but only if you'd stay

131
00:13:53,227 --> 00:13:54,617
I didn't like the sound of that

132
00:13:55,088 --> 00:14:00,553
- What do you want me to say? That I’m going to wait for you?
- I told you I’m coming back

133
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:05,457
- Yes, i have the dog as proof
- You didn't like it?

134
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:15,971
What do you want Ernesto, what do you want to hear?
That I’m going to wait forever,
that I’ll wait for months and months till you come back?

135
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:26,529
- What's going on?
- What do you want? What do you want?

136
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:32,279
I'd like you to stay like this forever. Quiet.

137
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,690
I want to look at you, cause I’m not going
to see you for a long time

138
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,797
Of course I’m going to wait for you,
but please don't take an eternity

139
00:14:56,231 --> 00:15:00,760
- And how long is an eternity?
- That's slippery ground mister

140
00:15:07,229 --> 00:15:08,930
I'm not going to touch you

141
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:22,817
Did i hit you? Did i hurt you? Did i hurt you?
That was a trick, a very bad trick

142
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:27,573
Ok lovebirds...is time to leave.
Fuser

143
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:34,952
Miss Ferreira...
Thanks for everything

And so...with Chichina, nothing...

154
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:08,188
Not even after giving her the German shepherd with pedigree...nothing

155
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:12,111
I mean, at least you saw a tit...one

156

I like that girl for you, i always said that she was your girlfriend.
We will eat better now

- No...
- Protein food

162
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:41,778
No, she gave me this money for when we get to the US.
She asked me to buy her some pants.

163
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,466
I told her i would

- What?
- Forget about this money. It is out of our budget.

00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:58,911
Listen to me man, what is wrong with your head?
That chick's got you by the balls.

167
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:02,251
Calm down

168
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:04,641
- Good evening
- Hi

169
00:18:15,284 --> 00:18:20,559
Piedra de Águila, Argentina
January 29th, 1952
Km 1809

170
00:18:22,947 --> 00:18:27,120
- How do you feel the bike?
- The wire is making wonders, it works great

171
00:18:34,726 --> 00:18:36,714
- Son of a bitch...fuck

172
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,898
Are you alright Fuser?

173
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:43,411
It was the curve

174
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,406
Son of a...

175
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,940
Look at the pipe...
son of a bitch!

176
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,373
Pass the stakes, I’m all out

177
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:57,637
Wait, wait, don't fuck with me

178
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,209
- You had to choose this place, you idiot...
- No you chose this place

179
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:03,459
Hold that side

180
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:13,929
- No...fuck
- Son of a...

181
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:18,591
- The river is taking it
- Grab it, grab it

182
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:22,110
It took it

183
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:39,173
- Che and what if we go there?
- We should ask for help over here, with the common people

184
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:48,906
- Which one are we doing? The broken headlight?
- No, Red October. You have the experience right?

185
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:55,138
Good Night

186
00:19:56,812 --> 00:19:57,852
What do you want

187
00:19:58,134 --> 00:20:04,818
Maybe our appearance doesn't show it, but we are doctors
from Buenos Aires and Córdoba, respectively

188
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:17,896
We are traveling all over the country, doing some research
with hopes of curing some of the worst diseases of the 20th century

189
00:20:18,103 --> 00:20:23,586
Plagues that not only consume our energy but that also
keeps Argentina in need

190
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:27,953
When by just reading the medical literature, you could notice, just as us...

191
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:31,890
What the fuck do you want, pair of bums?

192
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:39,215
Look sir, the wind took our tent, we are starving
and we need a place to spend the night

193
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:46,097
Ok, out there in the shed there's a good ground.
You can sleep with the workers

194
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:55,945
- We are doctors...
- Hmm...i like your face a lot, but i don't like yours fatty

195
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:00,323
- Fine?
- Yes, its fine
- Thank you.

196
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:21,890
<i>Dear Mom...we are still hitting the road,
but to tell you the truth, the bike is less powerful every day</i>

197
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:31,201
San Martín de los Andes, Argentina
January 31st, 1952
Km 2051

198
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:39,136
<i>Money and food are scarce, but we manage to find opportunities
to eat and sleep for free</i>

199
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:45,166
<i>Thanks to our secret weapon:
Alberto's infallible sweet talking</i>

200
00:21:45,198 --> 00:21:49,461
...plagues that not only consume our energy but compromise
the modernization of Argentina

201
00:21:49,594 --> 00:21:59,270
- So, you are doctors
- Well, no. Alberto is a biochemist and I am an MD student
- He is practically graduated, we are like doctors

202
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:05,309
- Then i would appreciate it if you could look at a swelling i have in the neck
- Gladly, eh...Mr.?

203
00:22:05,314 --> 00:22:06,273
Von Puttkamer

204
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:12,605
Does it hurt?

205
00:22:16,508 --> 00:22:19,322
- This is a tumor
- What do you mean a tumor?
- Yes

206
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,491
- Do you think so
- Yes
- Allow me

207
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:31,281
I don't know Fuser, fat sedimentation
it could be a cyst

208
00:22:31,587 --> 00:22:37,537
No.  It is a tumor in the occipital area

209
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,786
- Schatzie, these gentlemen say i have a tumor
- Tumor?

210
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:47,194
Good morning mam, i sincerely don't believe it is a tumor
but a sebaceous cyst

211
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:50,460
If you could give us a place where we could
eat and sleep we might be able to treat it

212
00:22:50,514 --> 00:22:56,691
No, no look...we can't treat it. You will have to go
to Buenos Aires. I can recommend you a specialist

213
00:22:57,023 --> 00:23:02,612
- Or we could try to help him, don't you think?
- Help with what? With the grass, with prayers?

214
00:23:02,736 --> 00:23:08,342
- I understand, you can't do anything for me
- Yes we can, if you give us a place where we could eat and sleep.

215
00:23:09,094 --> 00:23:18,190
- Around here there's a lake with lots of fish and a shed
- Sir, the diagnostic is very...
- We have nothing more to talk about, doctors. Let's go Schatzie

216
00:23:22,507 --> 00:23:28,854
- The next time could you try to help us a little
- Of course i can give you a hand, but never at the price of the health of a man

217
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:34,179
- Ok, let's say that you are right and the old guy has a tumor,
how the fuck do you tell him like that?

218
00:23:34,437 --> 00:23:37,204
Is the truth, if he can't handle it he can go to hell

219
00:23:37,205 --> 00:23:42,735
- You can't treat a patient like that, you can't
- The guy has a serious problem,
the sooner he looks into it the better

220
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:46,781
That's the proper treatment, didn't they teach you that
at biochemistry school?

221
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:52,157
Don't talk to me about proper medicine

222
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:57,253
Nurse. First graduate and then talk.
You think you know everything, moron

223
00:23:57,939 --> 00:23:59,516
I'm going to look for food

224
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:03,116
Duck! duck! duck!. Give me gun, move it! move it!

225
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,099
Son of a...

226
00:24:11,245 --> 00:24:12,389
Great Mial...

227
00:24:12,628 --> 00:24:13,604
I hit it, man

228
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:17,251
- How did you do it?
- I can't fucking believe it...

229
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:24,546
Well, there's no other choice but to get in the water
and pick up dinner, no?  Fuser, to the water to get the food!

230
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:27,546
You are really crazy if you think I’m going to get in there.
Do you know how cold is that water?

231
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:36,109
Yes, i know you are allergic to cold, water, hot and all that
but you know what, i am older, wiser and i shot the duck, so
you have to go

232
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:39,903
- That shot came out of your ass, besides i have asthma
- Ok, you are right. If you can't I’ll do it

233
00:24:41,632 --> 00:24:44,775
- I didn't say i couldn't
- You can't or you don't want to
- I didn't say that i couldn't

234
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:49,134
Or you don't want to and that is the same. Or you could give
me Chichina's fifteen bucks...

235
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,350
...and we eat as God intended, c'mon.

236
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:56,411
- Look if i get to find that fucking duck, I’ll eat it all by myself
- Ah! in the water, in the water, duck.

237
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:02,807
- I'm going to get my balls frozen
- For the use you give them, Fuser...

238
00:25:07,228 --> 00:25:14,635
Good Fuser, good...bring on that duck with potatoes.
Is it cold Fuser? Hey! cold? Not over here.

239
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:18,741
Duck

240
00:25:22,786 --> 00:25:27,052
- Are you feeling sick?
- No, I’m just perfect

Easy

243
00:25:43,531 --> 00:25:45,226
Fuser...

244
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:10,905
Fuser, listen to me. Give me Chichina's fifteen dollars and let's
go to a hospital like the people

245
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:15,353
If you say that to me again, I’ll throw up all over you.

246
00:26:59,082 --> 00:27:06,923
<i>Dear mom...what is it that's lost when you cross a border.
Each moment seems to be split in two</i>

other hand all the enthusiasm at entering new lands</i>

- Chile! Viva Chile!

250
00:27:25,715 --> 00:27:29,620
- Is it your first time out of the country?
- Yes, of course

251
00:27:29,723 --> 00:27:31,539
You are almost a man, Che

252
00:27:33,688 --> 00:27:40,792
Look Mial, when we are old and tired of traveling, we
should come back and set a clinic on this lake

253
00:27:43,238 --> 00:27:44,919
That's a good idea

254
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:47,901
Providing attention to everybody, if anyone ever comes

255
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:50,234
Count on me, brother

256
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:53,604
Hey, things are getting better Fuser, eh?
- Yeah

257
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:58,868
- Hey, it is snowing
- No, is just frost

258
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:27,328
- Help me
- On three, 1, 2, 3
- Done

259
00:28:36,296 --> 00:28:38,252
Go, go, go

260
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:48,504
- Fuck is cold!
- Some summer, uh

261
00:29:05,754 --> 00:29:09,165
Che, you told me we would enter Chile like two conquerors.
Not on foot like a pair of losers

262
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:11,275
If you don't like it, go fuck yourself Ernesto

TEMUCO, CHILE
February 18th, 1952
Km 2772

264
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,326
What if we dump this shit that gives us so much trouble

265
00:29:15,028 --> 00:29:17,412
And go on foot through the whole continent, you genius

266
00:29:17,993 --> 00:29:23,368
Yes, we would see more and meet more people...
you would lose weight

267
00:29:24,147 --> 00:29:27,120
You sissy, but if with a couple of dollars from
Chichina this gets fixed immediately

268
00:29:27,418 --> 00:29:29,620
And again with the same thing. Forget about that money

269
00:29:31,421 --> 00:29:36,199
Ok, perfect. If you get that mad then go all the way to Venezuela
walking and leave me here alone with the boss's money

270
00:29:36,663 --> 00:29:40,391
Know what? I would get there in half the time and stop
meddling with other people business

271
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,411
Fuck you bastard!

272
00:29:45,707 --> 00:29:49,215
"Uy, Ernestito, bring me the little Yankee pants
from Miami"

273
00:29:50,267 --> 00:29:54,295
Can't you see that you will never see them on or off?
You wanker!

274
00:29:57,206 --> 00:29:58,112
Fuser..

275
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,744
You know what your problem is?

276
00:30:04,422 --> 00:30:07,198
Your fucking honesty.

277
00:30:07,317 --> 00:30:10,159
You should tell a lie from now and then to help us.

278
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:17,922
- Hold it for a second

279
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:23,263
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?
- Come, Come

280
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:32,339
Thank you

281
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:36,781
- What? Do you have "mate"? Thank you.
- It has sugar

282
00:30:37,258 --> 00:30:41,559
- Excuse me, what's your name?
- Teresa
- Teresa, Ernesto, nice to meet you

283
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,868
- It would be nice as a souvenir, eh?
- A souvenir? I'll take back to Argentina

284
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:54,945
-You are traveling?
- Yes we are traveling, we are the owners of that old bike
- A the big one over there

285
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:57,325
- What are these?
- This is "malton"

286
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,118
- And This?
- These are oysters

287
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:05,638
Maybe next time ,ok? next time...

288
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:13,133
Austral Newspaper, 3 pesos,
Austral Newspaper, only 3 pesos

289

Get informed about Chile and the world,
for only 3 pesos

290
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:28,938
Yesterday evening, Temuco was honored by the arrival
of 2 of the most renowned leprosy specialists of Latin America

291
00:31:29,551 --> 00:31:34,530
- Dr. Alberto Granados from Córdoba
- What do you mean "Granados"
- That's what it says

292
00:31:35,343 --> 00:31:39,917
Dr. Alberto Granados from Córdoba and
Dr. Ernesto Guevara de la Serna from Buenos Aires

293
00:31:40,037 --> 00:31:43,724
They have embarked on an epic trip from their
homeland to the north point of Venezuela

294
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:51,560
The charismatic adventurer scientists, experts in their field,
have treated three thousand patients in all the continent.

295
00:31:53,589 --> 00:32:01,462
They hope to complete their trip in a record time of
five months, just in time to celebrate the 30th birthday
of the youthful Dr. Granados

296
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,864
- It says youthful, eh?
-  Yes, and so i get informed too.

297
00:32:05,803 --> 00:32:06,890
Do you think it will work?

298
00:32:19,472 --> 00:32:21,697
Hello, good evening

299
00:32:23,147 --> 00:32:30,220
My friend and i  have some problems with our bike
The direction is broken, the brakes are practically gone
and the shift box as always...

300
00:32:30,563 --> 00:32:32,346
And my backside is killing me...

301
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:36,192
Let's see. I can fix the direction, the brakes and the shift box.

302
00:32:36,775 --> 00:32:39,694
But i can't do anything about your backside.

303
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,904
We don't have any money

304
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:47,920
What? You don't have any money?

305
00:32:48,226 --> 00:32:52,084
When we get to Valparaiso we will receive some money,
when we have it we will send it to you...

306
00:32:52,353 --> 00:32:56,674
You know, i wouldn't want to be rude, but if you
don't have any money,
you have nothing to do here, so please...

307
00:32:56,715 --> 00:33:04,118
Excuse me the interruption, but if you help us right now you will
contribute to the bilateral relationships between our countries

308
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,490
If i understand correctly, you want me to fix it for free

309
00:33:06,682 --> 00:33:08,150
I think we are not making ourselves clear

310
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:12,610
besides we can't expect everybody to know
who's who in the Latin-American medicine field

311
00:33:12,774 --> 00:33:19,435
- Please doctor, come on in
- Yes, precisely today there was an article
published on the paper...

312
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:30,387
- Let me see...allow me
- Yes of course

313
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:40,853
- Look Piedad, Tulio look...

314
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:44,405
- Well the picture is not very good
- Yes we are not favorably depicted

315
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:47,077
Look, is them...

316
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:55,089
Gentlemen, for me it will be a great honor to fix your bike,
once i finish this card game with my wife

317
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,207
Of course, there's no problem

318
00:33:57,242 --> 00:33:58,555
That's the main priority.

319
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:05,095
Do you know that tonight there's a dance
and God willing, all the ladies of the town will be there

320
00:34:05,113 --> 00:34:05,813
Oh, what a shame.

321
00:34:07,124 --> 00:34:08,706
- Could you give me the paper back?
- Thanks a lot, you are very kind

322
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,952
- I'll bring the bike over
- Please bring it over, we will fix it

323
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:28,781
Could i have this dance?

324
00:34:36,499 --> 00:34:39,712
Cheers!

325
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:24,976
You know, i was just thinking about you

326
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:28,237
And why is that?

327
00:35:30,157 --> 00:35:32,296
You made quite an impression when i met you

328
00:35:36,964 --> 00:35:38,247
Thanks

329
00:35:43,563 --> 00:35:46,333
- Would you like to dance?
- No

330
00:35:47,684 --> 00:35:49,087
I don't dance

331
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:56,088
My husband fell asleep, he's drunk.
I don't have a dance partner

332
00:35:57,703 --> 00:36:01,753
Well, if you teach me, yes?

333
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:21,261
Hey, you finally remembered that you are a man?

334
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:23,381
You had forgotten?

335
00:36:25,009 --> 00:36:29,838
It's been a long time since i danced,
but is coming back to me, is coming back...

336
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,399
I can't dance here

337
00:36:48,801 --> 00:36:49,854
Would you like to keep dancing?

338
00:36:52,325 --> 00:36:53,834
Wouldn't you prefer to go out

339
00:36:55,911 --> 00:36:57,101
I would love to, yes

340
00:36:59,414 --> 00:37:00,778
Let's go

341
00:37:04,895 --> 00:37:06,940
- What's going on?
- No, we better stay

342
00:37:09,848 --> 00:37:10,759
Let me go!

343
00:37:12,124 --> 00:37:14,327
The Argentinean is leaving with your wife

344
00:37:14,462 --> 00:37:15,779
Let me go!

345
00:37:15,888 --> 00:37:17,552
Sorry, sorry...I’m sorry

346
00:37:17,422 --> 00:37:19,127
Argentinean mother fucker!!

347
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,049
Aren't you tired?

348
00:38:10,366 --> 00:38:11,268
No

349
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:13,910
- Don't you want to switch?
- No

350
00:38:14,288 --> 00:38:15,477
Are you sure?

351
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:34,047
Cows! cows!

352
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:37,172
I can't Stop, I can't stop!

353
00:38:37,913 --> 00:38:39,178
The brakes don't work

354
00:38:39,655 --> 00:38:40,615
Fucking mechanic

355
00:38:56,227 --> 00:38:58,627
- Are you ok?
- Perfect, what do you want me to tell you Fuser?

356
00:39:06,102 --> 00:39:07,234
Shitty mechanic

357
00:39:38,174 --> 00:39:40,143
Is he your father?

358
00:39:41,706 --> 00:39:42,968
Yes

359
00:39:49,184 --> 00:39:51,042
Hey, that cow is going blind

360
00:39:54,432 --> 00:39:56,070
...for the shit it's going to see

361
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:12,464
Los Angeles, Chile
February 26th, 1952
Km 2940

362
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:19,099
We are 25 days behind

363
00:40:23,658 --> 00:40:25,654
Wait wait wait wait

364
00:40:29,048 --> 00:40:30,200
Hello

365
00:40:30,956 --> 00:40:34,226
There's a rumor that the Chilean women are the most
daring in all the continent

366
00:40:34,258 --> 00:40:38,343
Well, the rumors have no scientific support Dr. Granado.
We have to make a field test

367
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:42,078
You didn't like them, really?

368
00:40:44,756 --> 00:40:45,538
Here they come

369
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:51,310
Hello girls

370
00:40:51,711 --> 00:40:53,211
- Excuse us, the place is packed...

371
00:40:53,256 --> 00:40:57,722
- Can we sit with you?
- Yes, of course
- Thanks

372
00:40:59,876 --> 00:41:01,981
- How are you?...Ernesto
- He is Alberto

373
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:04,779
- Miss?
- Jazmín

374
00:41:05,031 --> 00:41:05,860
Daniela

375
00:41:06,517 --> 00:41:07,913
- Nice to meet you
- Nice to meet you

376
00:41:09,095 --> 00:41:11,724
- So are you Argentineans?
- How did you know?

377
00:41:12,495 --> 00:41:16,158
I don't know...the accent,
because you say "Che", i don't know

378
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,726
- Had you noticed that Che? i hadn't
- No me neither

379
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:25,022
- Do you know what day is today?
- February 26th

380
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:31,942
February 26th...we are going to seem like liars,
but it has been a year...

381
00:41:32,186 --> 00:41:33,779
A year? A year since when?

382
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:37,483
- A year since we started this trip
- That's nice

383
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:44,098
- Damn, one year and we don't have one cent to celebrate
- Wouldn't you like us to invite you a bottle of wine?

384
00:41:44,604 --> 00:41:45,985
- Wine?
- Yes...

385
00:41:46,446 --> 00:41:53,247
Lucho, bring a bottle of wine to our Argentinean visitors that
have made such an effort

386
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:58,251
But ladies, please don't takes this the wrong way,
but i can't drink wine

387
00:41:58,598 --> 00:42:01,327
- But why, why can't you drink a little wine to celebrate?
- Exactly...

388
00:42:01,943 --> 00:42:07,216
- Well there is an old tradition in Argentina that...
- Please c'mon, don't...
- What?

389
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:10,795
- I think they deserve and explanation
- Is adequate, yes

390
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:20,489
Thanks Lucho...Well, there is a long costume in Argentina
that doesn't allow us to drink with empty stomachs

391
00:42:20,902 --> 00:42:27,576
And since we don't have any money at the moment, we can't
buy food and we must reject your generous offer

392
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:38,614
Please, don't be like that...wait.
Lucho, could you bring us some empanadas

393
00:42:38,873 --> 00:42:41,008
- Do you like Chilean empanadas?
- I have never tried them

394
00:42:41,283 --> 00:42:44,314
- four, eight?
- They are really hungry.  Twelve.

395
00:42:46,423 --> 00:42:47,306
I've always liked that number

396
00:42:47,404 --> 00:42:52,512
- I would really like to stay here
- Too bad we don't have a place to stay,
but we can sleep at the plaza

397
00:42:53,257 --> 00:43:00,208
Hey, but my father loves Argentineans.
I think he can help you

398
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:03,788
He is the chief of the fire department,
so he knows a lot of people

399
00:43:03,823 --> 00:43:06,367
Wait, are you sisters?

400
00:43:06,658 --> 00:43:09,657
Yes, of course, you hadn't noticed? Look...

401
00:43:10,438 --> 00:43:11,310
They hadn't noticed.

402
00:43:12,473 --> 00:43:15,346
- The mechanic doesn't come back until tomorrow,
but the bike can stay here

403
00:43:15,347 --> 00:43:16,347
- Thanks a lot

404
00:43:17,526 --> 00:43:23,407
Guys, let me introduce you to two Argentinean volunteers
that will be staying here with you

405
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:30,538
- Let me introduce you to Dr. Che Skinny and Dr. Che Fatty
- Nice to meet you

406
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:33,584
- Hey, would you like to see more of the town?
- Yes

407
00:43:34,504 --> 00:43:36,466
- But...
- Don't worry sir

408
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:39,227
- Excuse me...
- Yes?

409
00:43:42,841 --> 00:43:45,321
I wouldn't like to bother you, but are you really doctors?

410
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:47,418
- No
- Yes
- No

411
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:48,876
I'm a biochemist

412
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:52,578
- Could you visit a lady that is sick
- Yes, when you tell me...

413
00:43:53,343 --> 00:43:57,032
Could it be right now, cause she is really sick.
It's been a very long time since she saw a doctor

414
00:43:57,604 --> 00:44:00,595
Ok, let me pick up my things and we will go.

415
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:03,633
Is nice to be faithful to the Hippocratic oath, Fuser

416
00:44:10,405 --> 00:44:11,528
Excuse me

417
00:44:18,211 --> 00:44:19,402
Look at my eyes

418
00:44:27,382 --> 00:44:28,595
I'm going to touch your neck a little

419
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:38,656
Has she eaten?

420
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:41,510
I don't know

421
00:45:09,725 --> 00:45:11,903
Look, Doña Rosa, I’m going to leave you these pills

422
00:45:14,073 --> 00:45:15,763
Take one with each meal

423
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:18,594
And one before bedtime.

424
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:22,026
This will help you feel better

425
00:45:29,759 --> 00:45:35,372
<i>Dear mom...I knew i wouldn't be able to help that poor woman</i>

426
00:45:35,547 --> 00:45:39,184
<i>That up to a month ago she had been serving
tables, panting like me</i>

427
00:45:39,798 --> 00:45:41,483
<i>Trying to live with dignity</i>

428
00:45:43,404 --> 00:45:47,392
<i>In those dying eyes, there was a humble
request for excuses</i>

429
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:52,729
<i>And a desperate plea of consolation
that gets lost in the emptiness</i>

430
00:45:53,321 --> 00:45:59,310
<i>Just as her body will get lost very soon
in the magnitude of the mystery that surrounds us</i>

431
00:46:05,947 --> 00:46:10,974
Fuser, you still haven't asked me how was the
field test with the Chilean sisters

432
00:46:11,918 --> 00:46:15,709
You know how i fear that you might become
the new sexual ambassador of Argentina

433
00:46:16,943 --> 00:46:19,487
Are you the two lazy asses that travel
on that piece of crap

434
00:46:20,805 --> 00:46:22,907
Her name is "La Poderosa"

435
00:46:23,338 --> 00:46:27,863
It was. But now we could name it The Dead One, The Paraplegic

436
00:46:27,999 --> 00:46:29,203
Oh yeah, why?

437
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,640
What do you mean why? Because I’m
the mechanic, what else

438
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:38,492
If you sell it per pound, you might obtain something,
but that piece of crap arrived dead here, really

439
00:46:53,808 --> 00:46:55,607
I'll be missing you Negra

440
00:47:04,285 --> 00:47:06,222
I'll take these, let's go

441
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,674
What do we do? Should we go on?

442
00:47:15,431 --> 00:47:19,323
Yes, we go on.
You only reach 30 once in a lifetime

443
00:47:27,323 --> 00:47:29,675
You are really something
Ernesto Guevara de la Serna

444
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:34,578
- If we change the dollars...
- No, don't even think about it

445
00:48:14,247 --> 00:48:16,116
We arrived at Valparaiso

446
00:48:17,465 --> 00:48:22,466
"I love Valparaiso. How much you encompass
and how much you irradiate bride of the ocean"

447
00:48:23,248 --> 00:48:25,420
"Even far away from your deaf halo..."

448
00:48:25,518 --> 00:48:28,884
- Federico García Lorca
- No
- No, it's Neruda

450
00:48:48,453 --> 00:48:50,079
Thank you

451
00:48:50,718 --> 00:48:53,300
- From Chichina!
- Chichina, and the money?

452
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:56,989
- Should i open it?
- Yes open it

453
00:48:57,957 --> 00:48:59,899
I leave you alone love bird

454
00:49:09,807 --> 00:49:11,355
How do i love you Celia de la Serna!

455
00:49:19,216 --> 00:49:20,416
What's going on?

456
00:49:24,976 --> 00:49:26,192
Fuser

457
00:50:19,573 --> 00:50:22,581
- Che, are you ready?
- Me?
- Yes you

458
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:24,251
- Of course
- Let's go

459
00:50:24,376 --> 00:50:25,472
Right away sir

460
00:50:55,647 --> 00:50:59,865
Atacama Desert, Chile
March 11, 1952
Km 4960

461
00:51:06,028 --> 00:51:08,519
You know what, my plan was a lot better

462
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:14,698
You are so fucking proud, at least answer me

463
00:51:17,466 --> 00:51:18,882
Do you want to go back?

464
00:51:19,544 --> 00:51:22,879
Go ahead...
I'll get to the mine and then I’ll tell you what it looks like

465
00:51:24,211 --> 00:51:26,737
Are you suggesting that i won't make it to the mine?

466
00:51:27,957 --> 00:51:30,845
If you can little doctor asthma, i can do it too

467
00:51:32,537 --> 00:51:33,252
Moron

468
00:51:34,448 --> 00:51:35,902
Oh, you want to win?

469
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:43,959
Stop! Fuck!

470
00:51:54,022 --> 00:51:56,403
- Good evening, how are you?
- What's your name?

471
00:51:56,539 --> 00:51:59,041
- Ernesto
- Nice to meet you

472
00:52:09,999 --> 00:52:15,430
Yes, that's it, that's were we are from

473
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,665
We didn't have much, just a dry and difficult land

474
00:52:21,573 --> 00:52:23,426
It belonged to his grandparents

475
00:52:23,965 --> 00:52:28,287
It was ours, until a landlord arrived and kicked us out

476
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:35,951
- And that is what they call progress
- We had to leave our son with the family and travel to find job

477
00:52:36,387 --> 00:52:41,588
- Trying to escape from the police that wanted to catch us
- Why?

478
00:52:42,889 --> 00:52:44,968
Because we are communists

479
00:52:45,877 --> 00:52:49,200
We are going to the mine. If we are lucky I’ll find a job.

480
00:52:50,597 --> 00:52:53,693
Apparently they are so dangerous that they
don't care what party you belong to

481
00:52:56,735 --> 00:52:58,758
Are you looking for a job?

482
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,125
No, we are not.

483
00:53:02,553 --> 00:53:07,561
No? And then why are you traveling?

484
00:53:11,101 --> 00:53:13,142
Just because

485
00:53:20,305 --> 00:53:26,637
Bless you, blessed be your travels

486
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:32,609
Take this

487
00:53:33,072 --> 00:53:33,530
Thanks

488
00:53:36,945 --> 00:53:38,614
- Some "mate"
- Thanks

489
00:53:41,124 --> 00:53:43,765
<i>Those eyes had a dark and tragic expression</i>

490
00:53:45,985 --> 00:53:50,045
<i>They told us about some friends that had disappeared
under mysterious circumstances</i>

491
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,346
<i>And that apparently ended up in some
part on the bottom of the ocean</i>

492
00:53:57,432 --> 00:54:00,187
<i>That was one of the coldest nights of my life</i>

493
00:54:01,694 --> 00:54:09,754
<i>But meeting them made me feel closer to human kind.
Strange, so strange to me</i>

494
00:54:19,284 --> 00:54:24,289
You...you too
You, the next one

495
00:54:34,911 --> 00:54:37,397
Move it, guys, move it

496
00:54:39,064 --> 00:54:42,415
Chuquicamata Mine, Chile
March 15th, 1952
Km 5122

497
00:55:02,789 --> 00:55:04,200
Move it, guys, move it

498
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,243
Get in the truck. The rest go to your homes.
Out

499
00:55:32,634 --> 00:55:34,673
You two, what are doing here?

500
00:55:35,778 --> 00:55:36,623
Nothing, we are looking

501
00:55:37,006 --> 00:55:39,716
Looking at what, this is not a tourist attraction. Out

502
00:55:40,427 --> 00:55:44,012
Can't you see that these people are thirsty.
Give them some water damn it.

503
00:55:46,224 --> 00:55:47,764
I will call security so they will arrest you

504
00:55:48,061 --> 00:55:49,261
Oh yeah. Why?

505
00:55:49,493 --> 00:55:53,301
Invasion of property. This is the property of the
Anaconda Mining Company

506
00:55:55,595 --> 00:55:56,579
Let's go.

507
00:56:01,283 --> 00:56:01,924
Son of a bitch
