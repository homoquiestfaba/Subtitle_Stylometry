1
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,712
(upbeat music)

2
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,038
- [Anne] What's this?

3
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,140
- [Paul] I'm putting
 in a hoop for Jack.

4
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,508
- [Anne] What's going on here?

5
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,709
- [Paul] What?

6
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:23,710
- [Anne] What are you doing?

7
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,578
- I'm putting in
a hoop for Jack.

8
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,080
- [Anne] Today?

9
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,815
- [Paul] Yeah, it was the
 only day Mike was available.

10
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,550
- It wasn't supposed
 to be today.

11
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,520
You have to tell
me these things.

12
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,689
Oh, God, look at it.

13
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,591
Oh, why did you?

14
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:39,926
- Because this is the
 only spot it can go.

15
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,361
- That's not the only spot.

16
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,296
Oh, this is
ridiculous, I mean, oh,

17
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,231
I don't believe it.

18
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,599
- He's gonna love it.

19
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,433
- You know it,
 this is it, really.

20
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,937
This is it, the last time.

21
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,172
- But the roses have black
  spot already, I'll spray.

22
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:56,910
- No, not with the, oh,
dammit, leave me alone.

23
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,444
Leave me alone.

24
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,312
- [Jack Voiceover] Do you
  ever look at your family

25
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,513
and wonder who they are?

26
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,316
Those are my parents.

27
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,022
- They're not my roses,
  they're the house's roses.

28
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,657
- [Jack Voiceover] At
 least they used to be.

29
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,296
- How's the boat building?

30
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,368
- [Jack] Are we
 going to the movies?

31
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,103
- [Paul] I have to
  move some stuff.

32
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,142
- [Jack] But it's Saturday,

33
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,444
and we always go to
the movies on Saturday.

34
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:47,493
- Jack wants to go to the movie.

35
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,263
I thought I'd drop the stuff
 off, then maybe take him.

36
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,864
- You're not taking
 him anywhere.

37
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,835
- You're acting extreme, Anne.

38
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,236
- Don't tell me how I'm acting.

39
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,274
- Okay.

40
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,010
Sorry, no movie today, Jack.

41
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,144
- [Jack] Why not?

42
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,679
- Because I say so.

43
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,048
- [Jack] But we always go
  to the movies on Saturday.

44
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,485
- Anne.

45
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,394
- [Jack Voiceover] To
be honest, I didn't give

46
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,731
a damn about the movie, but
 there was something going on,

47
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,001
and I didn't know what it was,
 and I didn't know what to do,

48
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:28,968
except act normal.

49
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,911
- [Paul] Tell Jack
 I'll call him later.

50
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,455
- [Jack Voiceover] It's
like you had a hero,

51
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,957
and all of a sudden he's gone.

52
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,994
When you're a kid and
 you've got a father

53
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,964
who reminds you of
 Superman, who seems like he

54
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,867
can do anything, a father
  who's the kind of guy

55
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,504
that climbs on the roof to
 rescue your dweeby G.I. Joe

56
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,440
when it's caught up there
 in some idiotic experiment.

57
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,512
And then, one day, he's gone,

58
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,547
disappeared into a
  million different

59
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,816
green plastic garbage bags.

60
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,384
No explanations offered.

61
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,822
Nothing anyone says later
  makes a bit of difference.

62
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,426
- Shot of the green?

63
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,393
- [Jack] No thanks.

64
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,097
- Listen, I was
 thinking, I could just

65
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,999
stay at my place
 tonight, if you like.

66
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,401
- Whatever makes you happy.

67
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,904
- Look, if you want
 me here, I'm here.

68
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,772
I just never know
 what you're thinking.

69
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:47,046
- Why don't you let
 him move in already?

70
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,916
He practically lives here
anyway, so what's the big deal?

71
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,454
Oh come on, he's living
out of a duffel bag.

72
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,089
You should at least
 give him a drawer.

73
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,457
- I don't wanna rush things.

74
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,030
It's Wednesday, so don't
forget, dinner with Dad.

75
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,864
- [Jack] Okay.

76
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:06,599
- [Michael] Want a ride?

77
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:07,433
- Sure.

78
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,003
- See ya tonight.

79
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,215
Wednesdays are very intense.

80
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,450
- Yeah, it's the dinner
with the dad thing.

81
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,186
You know, when he first left,

82
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,088
I wasn't allowed
  to see him at all.

83
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,390
Then she felt guilty,
 so she started

84
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,792
the Dinner with Dad program.

85
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,928
You're lucky you missed
the bit where she tried

86
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,430
to be like my replacement dad.

87
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,099
- [Michael] Oh, was that
the basketball stuff?

88
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,536
- Mm-hmm, and she's
 actually gotten pretty good.

89
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,638
It's just a little weird.

90
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,473
Especially the time
 she tried to take me

91
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,208
to the father-son team dinner.

92
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,513
Yeah, so are your
 parents still married?

93
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,547
- Yeah, 43 years.

94
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:56,916
You know, it's amazing
 to think of spending

95
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,818
your whole life
 with the one person.

96
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,053
- Yeah, equally amazing to watch

97
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,588
your whole family fall apart.

98
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,900
- For five bucks, name the
 guidance counselor I spieed

99
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,234
shoplifting at K-Mart.

100
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,736
- [Student] Wagstaff.

101
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,572
- Laydon, I saw her slip
  a stapler into her purse,

102
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,207
and then some Tootsie Rolls.

103
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,814
(dream-like music)

104
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:46,999
(whistle blowing)

105
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,267
- All right, listen up.

106
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,068
We're gonna start
  with some drills.

107
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,269
Four lines, go, go.

108
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:55,541
One passes to three,
 two passes to four.

109
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:59,111
A braid, you guys, like
a smooth strand of DNA.

110
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,447
From one side of the gym
to the other, let's go.

111
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,084
Come on, synchronize,
 guys, synchronize.

112
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:10,389
Know where the other men are,
 anticipate the next move.

113
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,726
You're walking through it, guys,

114
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,095
you look like a buncha
 pansies, come on.

115
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,165
(whistle blowing)

116
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,435
(basketball dribbling)

117
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,075
- You know, my dad showed
  up again yesterday.

118
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,310
- Oh yeah, what did
 you do this time?

119
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,413
- He put a basketball
 hoop out front.

120
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,515
- Oh really?

121
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,349
That's great.

122
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,420
- Yeah, except last night,
  I kinda lost my mind

123
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,955
and attacked it.

124
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,223
I tried to knock it down,

125
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,392
and now it's just
  a wee bit tilted.

126
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,895
- Tilting adds character.

127
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,630
- Maybe.

128
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,213
- [Jack Voiceover] When
Mrs. Burka smiled at me,

129
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,714
I think I turned beet red.

130
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,084
I woulda stared at her, if
 only I could've figured out

131
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,986
how to do it without
 getting caught.

132
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,555
- You want an apple?

133
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,790
- No thanks.

134
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,092
- Hey, Samster Hamster
 boy, how you doing?

135
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:20,893
- Good.

136
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,161
- Want some milk?

137
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,396
- No, we don't want
 milk, all right.

138
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,697
We don't wanna talk, either.

139
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,633
- You staying for
 dinner tonight, Jack?

140
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,236
- Not tonight.

141
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,973
- Okay.

142
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,207
I like your mom.

143
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,442
She always wants to
 know everything--

144
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:37,910
- No, my mom needs
 to get a life, okay?

145
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,879
Every day I come home, she's
 like, do you wanna talk?

146
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,047
She's thoroughly bored.

147
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,051
(explosions)

148
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:51,857
See what I just did?

149
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,861
So, you gonna drop
  a bomb or what?

150
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:59,131
- No, Max, I outgrew the
  impulse to blow things up

151
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,599
about two years ago.

152
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,902
I'm just waiting
 for you to catch up.

153
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,170
(explosion)

154
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,006
- Oh, napalm.

155
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,124
- Daddy's home.

156
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,395
Daddy's home, Daddy's home.

157
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,764
- Hey, hey, monster man.

158
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,000
(groaning)

159
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,269
- Hey, hon, how was your day?

160
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,070
- [Steve] Good.

161
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,138
- Yeah?

162
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,406
- [Steve] Good, really good.

163
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,807
I scored a new client today.

164
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,976
It's gonna mean
 extra work, but uh,

165
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:44,810
that's what I'm here for, right?

166
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,213
- Oh, no, here.

167
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,047
Do you wanna beer or something?

168
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:48,881
- Yes, please.

169
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:49,982
- Great.

170
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,017
- Thank you.

171
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,451
Maxie, go deep.

172
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:02,461
- Head's up.

173
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,008
- Honey.

174
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,879
Why are the
 trashcans still here?

175
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,280
How many times have I told
  you to take them out back?

176
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,752
- I better go, it's
 dinner with Dad.

177
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,454
- Yeah, how is your dad,
 haven't seen him for a while.

178
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,288
- He's good.

179
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,521
- [Jack Voiceover] What
I didn't tell Mr. B.

180
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,957
is that every Wednesday
night, my father and I

181
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,094
played a weird game where
  we got all dressed up

182
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,763
and he took me to some
 totally expensive restaurant

183
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,666
and talked to me about
  incredibly serious stuff,

184
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,335
like the meaning of life,
  while I was busy worrying

185
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,370
about whether I was
 using the right fork.

186
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,444
- [Waitress] What can
 I get you tonight?

187
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,481
- I'll have the
  tuna, rare please.

188
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,249
- [Waitress] Okay, and
 what would you like?

189
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,484
- Chicken for me.

190
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,052
And can I get
 french fries instead

191
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,653
of scalloped potatoes, please?

192
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:35,721
- [Waitress] Sure, honey.

193
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,792
- Look, Jack,

194
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,131
I've been spending a lotta time
trying to figure things out.

195
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,768
Now I don't know if this is
gonna make any sense to you, but

196
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,905
you're at an age now, that,

197
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,977
people love to do things, right?

198
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,615
Some people love to read,
  some people love to go

199
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,415
to the movies.

200
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,819
Your mom loves
 reading the newspaper.

201
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:07,820
You love basketball.

202
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,957
What I'm trying to
 say is that there are

203
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,427
many different kinds of love.

204
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,800
How we love, no,
not how we love.

205
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,672
What we allow ourselves to feel

206
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,175
is very complicated.

207
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:31,644
And, and,

208
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,314
sometimes love doesn't
 has any limits.

209
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,585
What do you think about
  when you think about love?

210
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,419
- Nothing.

211
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,821
I think nothing.

212
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,290
- Nothing, you think nothing.

213
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:49,061
So basically this dinner
was a waste of time?

214
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:49,895
- Pretty much.

215
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,276
(horn honking)

216
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,679
(soft music)

217
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,151
- [Paul] Do you
 remember when we went

218
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,452
on that huge Ferris wheel?

219
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,554
- I think I was three.

220
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,624
- Why is that parents
 always do things

221
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,626
with kids when they're
 too young to remember?

222
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,696
You enjoyed it very much.

223
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,165
- Look, you're always
 asking me to remember.

224
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,634
It's like a constant
 walk down Memory Lane.

225
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,638
Do you remember when
 everything use to be normal?

226
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,140
Do you remember when you
  still lived at our house?

227
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:40,246
Come on, can we just stay in
 the present, here and now.

228
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,149
- I was just thinking
 about things.

229
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,718
- Duh.

230
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,153
(soft music)

231
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:57,129
(horn honking)

232
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,569
- [Paul] Here, try the calamari.

233
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,076
- Tastes like a
deep-friend rubber band.

234
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,214
So what's calamari?

235
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,316
- It's Italian for
deep-fried rubber band.

236
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,019
Squid.

237
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,921
Wanna try the portobello?

238
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,023
- What is it?

239
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:24,857
- Mushroom.

240
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,094
How about I pick the
  restaurant the next time?

241
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,963
- Might be a good idea.

242
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,399
(soft music)

243
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,005
- How was dinner
  with your father?

244
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,340
- Good.

245
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,341
- What did you eat?

246
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,175
- Creepy stuff.

247
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:47,146
- What did you talk about?

248
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,314
- I have no idea.

249
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,549
- Shall we hang this?

250
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,052
- Okay.

251
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,257
- You know, I got a hammer
 downstairs, if you need one?

252
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:01,327
- No, no, it's not a big hole.

253
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,561
- Listen, they're coming
around to collect stuff

254
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,029
for the homeless
  shelter tomorrow,

255
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,666
so anything you don't need
would be a bounty for the poor.

256
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,635
- Sure.

257
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,469
- Oh, very nice.

258
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,509
- It's stuff I've been saving.

259
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,246
Historical artifacts
 of my entire life,

260
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,248
in case the Smithsonian
ever needs to do

261
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,951
an exhibit on me,
  the American boy.

262
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,386
- Ah.

263
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,988
- There are a few key
 elements in case I ever get

264
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:33,158
amnesia and need to be
 reminded of who I am.

265
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,827
- Right.

266
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,362
Thank you.

267
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,130
And listen, I meant to ask you.

268
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,633
How would you feel if I built
 a Zendo in the backyard?

269
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,001
- What's a Zendo?

270
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,737
- It's like a meditation room.

271
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,839
You could use it too
 whenever you need a moment.

272
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,973
- [Anne] It'd be great.

273
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,676
- Our friends thank you.

274
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,485
- [Anne] Shoot a few?

275
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:04,490
- Mom, you're embarrassing me.

276
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,391
- Oh come on,

277
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:07,993
You know, I could
  get good at this.

278
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,328
Maybe I should join a team.

279
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,834
Oh, come on, try again.

280
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,671
- Okay.

281
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,940
(laughing)

282
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,116
- Come on, be a good
 sport, you should be proud.

283
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:34,686
How many kids can say their
 moms can play basketball?

284
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,122
Yes!

285
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,993
It's gonna be okay, you know?

286
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,832
That's it, that's it.

287
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:47,733
- [Jack] Yeah.

288
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,634
- Oh, come on.

289
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,609
- Come on.

290
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,047
Aren't you excited?

291
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,149
Hi, Mr. Bailey.

292
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:05,884
- Mrs. Stanford.

293
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,089
- Go on.

294
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,023
Go on.

295
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,759
(dramatic music)

296
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:22,000
- New drivers pass
  through levels.

297
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,736
Each level offers
 more responsibility,

298
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,206
freedom from restrictions.

299
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,440
What's this?

300
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,374
- Rear bumper.

301
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:30,209
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,645
Teenagers pick up their
parents' driving habits.

303
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,315
- Trunk.

304
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,217
- Correct, how do
 your parents drive?

305
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,420
Do they put it in reverse
  without looking behind?

306
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,888
Do they pull out too fast.

307
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,825
The more crashes the
 parents have had,

308
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,161
the greater the likelihood
  the teen will crash.

309
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:52,297
Get in the driver's seat.

310
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,735
Have your parents crashed?

311
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,203
- I don't know,
  they're divorced.

312
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,941
- [Mr. Bailey] Put
  on your seat belt.

313
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,309
Start her up.

314
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,514
And drive it very, very
slowly down the street.

315
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,615
- [Jack] Okay.

316
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,784
(car starting)

317
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,587
(tires squealing)

318
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,758
Sorry, sorry.

319
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,493
- [Mr. Bailey] I have
only one neck, smoothly.

320
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,761
- [Jack] Sorry.

321
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,867
- Seeing is believing.

322
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,437
Think about your blind spots.

323
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,773
You can't ever forget,

324
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,610
there's always something
you cannot see.

325
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,946
- Yeah, that I know already.

326
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,819
- [Jack Voiceover] Time passed.

327
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,522
It wasn't like I got over
  it, but life went on.

328
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,759
Except for now, my mom let my
 dad take me on Saturdays too.

329
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,496
I was finally growing more
 hair on my legs than my mom,

330
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,299
and things were
 pretty much things.

331
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,901
(horn honking)

332
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,443
(birds chirping)

333
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,644
- [Paul] So, what's new?

334
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,047
- [Jack] Not much.

335
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:20,919
Are you okay?

336
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,754
- Yeah.

337
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,991
- You just have that look.

338
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,029
- What look?

339
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,664
- The one where you're
 about to say something

340
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,499
that's gonna make
  me lose my lunch.

341
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,769
Or the one where you pause
  for a really long time

342
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,505
and you say something
 like, Grandma's sick,

343
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,508
which means she's already
 dead or something like that.

344
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,610
- Well Grandma's fine.

345
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,349
But we need to talk.

346
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,117
- See?

347
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,889
- Look, Jack, I, I don't
 know if you can understand,

348
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,124
but I'm gonna tell you.

349
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,233
I have been running
 away from myself,

350
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:12,638
all these years, and a
 person can't do that forever.

351
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,472
It catches up.

352
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,278
A while ago, I realized that,

353
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,349
that I would be happier
if I did not live

354
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,584
with your or your mother.

355
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,624
Hey, I love her.

356
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,794
I always did, I always
  will and I still do, but.

357
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,902
Do you remember
 Bob, my friend Bob?

358
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,646
- Yeah, the guy you
 went on the trip with?

359
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,480
- Mm-hmm.

360
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:10,929
Bob and I are lovers.

361
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,613
- I wanna go home.

362
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:34,453
- [Paul] Jack!

363
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,557
Jack.

364
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:42,728
Jack.

365
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,634
Jack?

366
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,079
- Get in the car,
 I'll give you a ride.

367
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,080
- I'll walk, thanks.

368
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,217
- Get in the car, you're
gonna get pneumonia.

369
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,051
- I'll walk.

370
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,719
- Jack, don't do this.

371
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,421
- Do what?

372
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,823
You're the one who's doing it.

373
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,562
- I told you because I
thought you should know.

374
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,066
Nothing has changed, I'm
exactly the same person

375
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,100
I was 20 minutes ago.

376
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,303
Jack, I'm still your father.

377
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,138
- No you're not.

378
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,812
- He never even told you?

379
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:34,646
Elaine.

380
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,984
Okay, yeah, I'll see
 you tomorrow, bye.

381
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,754
What happened?

382
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,556
- Well, other than my father
 telling me he was gay,

383
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:45,524
I sent for a swim.

384
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,928
How can this, I
shoulda seen it coming.

385
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,398
I shoulda been smarter, I
 shoulda been paying attention

386
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,666
to what he was trying to tell me

387
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,902
over all that
 lobster and calamari.

388
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,737
- Your father loves
 you very much.

389
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,238
- He's not my father.

390
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,174
- Yes, he is, he's your
  father and you're his son.

391
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,008
- No.

392
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,744
Mom, no, no.

393
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,980
He's a stranger, he's
 a person I don't know.

394
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,683
He's got a whole other life.

395
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:13,752
He's got a boyfriend.

396
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,489
How can this even be happening?

397
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:20,358
Did you know?

398
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,931
Oh well, how did he tell you?

399
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,933
Did he take you out
 in a rowboat too?

400
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,469
- He doesn't like
  keeping secrets.

401
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,438
- Well he shoulda kept that one.

402
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:34,940
- He and Bob are getting
an apartment together.

403
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,808
Did he tell you that?

404
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,277
- No, but he was probably
  about to when I jumped.

405
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:49,354
Mom, I don't wanna
  see him anymore.

406
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,092
(footsteps)

407
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,532
(crickets chirping)

408
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,210
- If you wanna
 talk, you gotta dig.

409
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,751
- And what's to talk about?

410
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,920
All of a sudden my
father is a fairy queen.

411
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,359
Is that why he left
 us, he's a fairy?

412
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:29,828
- Don't use that word.

413
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:31,997
- What word should I use?

414
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,467
- Your father and I separated
 because we couldn't get along.

415
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:36,701
We couldn't live together.

416
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,204
You remember how we
 were always fighting.

417
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,640
- Yeah, because it turns
out Dad's a big old fag.

418
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,710
How can he be a homo
and have me as his kid.?

419
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,750
Homos don't get married,
  and homos don't have kids.

420
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,984
Was he always a homo?

421
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,288
- Your father was always
going through phases.

422
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,124
Gardening, music, car repairs.

423
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,228
It was always something.

424
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,330
I actually thought this
was one of his phases.

425
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,533
- Why is he doing this to me?

426
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,902
- No one is doing
  anything to you.

427
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,441
He was telling you who
he was, about his life,

428
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,576
and he wanted to make
 you part of his life.

429
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,214
- Well, if he's a homo,

430
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,216
what does that make me?

431
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,420
Am I homo too now?

432
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,790
Because maybe that's
 it, maybe I'm a homo

433
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,024
and I don't even know it.

434
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,226
- Jack, you're two
  separate people.

435
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,264
He is who he is,

436
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,434
and you're gonna
figure out who you are.

437
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,076
- When he first left, I
thought it was my fault.

438
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,714
I was too boring, I wasn't
  enough of a movie freak,

439
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,216
I wasn't fast
 enough at baseball.

440
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,317
- Life is complicated.

441
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,956
You think I didn't
 wonder what happened?

442
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,994
He's your father, but
 he was my husband.

443
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,897
(gentle music)

444
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:13,999
Maybe it was me, Jack.

445
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,302
Maybe it was something I did.

446
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,173
I wasn't a good enough wife.

447
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:24,843
I wasn't a good enough mother.

448
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,847
I never made breakfast.

449
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:29,681
I smoke.

450
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,084
I hate cleaning the house.

451
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:33,918
- No.

452
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,590
No, no, no, it's not you.

453
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,393
It's Dad, it's his fault.

454
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,230
Mom, I hate him.

455
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,332
I hate him, I hate him,
I hate him, I hate him.

456
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,466
- Shh.

457
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:51,136
(phone ringing)

458
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,455
- [Jack Voiceover] My father
 called about 20 times a day

459
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,957
trying to get me to let
him be my father again.

460
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,061
He would drive over
 and just sit outside,

461
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,996
not moving, like a statue.

462
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,599
I refused to talk to him,
  and even that didn't work.

463
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:26,004
(fire alarm ringing)

464
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,877
- You ever just
 wanna go up to a girl

465
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:33,912
and plant one on her?

466
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,217
Like, I bet I can get
 that girl to kiss me.

467
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,886
- [Max] You don't even know her.

468
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:42,720
- So?

469
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,056
- What's the deal with you?

470
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,524
Suddenly, you're Mr. Hormonal.

471
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:49,127
You have to kiss a girl or
 you're gonna die or something.

472
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,829
- Okay, just pick
  a girl and I bet

473
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,063
I can get her to kiss me.

474
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:53,832
- Fine.

475
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:58,470
And what about her?

476
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:02,273
- [Jack] Can't you at least
 pick someone who's human?

477
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,378
Maggie Rogers?

478
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:09,180
No, the degree of
  difficulty on her

479
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,715
is just a big too high.

480
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,784
- Well, you can't just
go up and kiss somebody.

481
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,452
You'll get arrested.

482
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:17,455
Okay, remember that
kindergartener who got expelled?

483
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,556
You have to ask first.

484
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,032
- [Teacher] Is this where
  you're supposed to be?

485
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,901
- Yeah, yeah it
 is, for the moment,

486
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:33,404
this is exactly where
 I'm supposed to be.

487
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,174
(dramatic music)

488
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:45,717
Okay, how did you do that?

489
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,652
Did you give her money?

490
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,487
Did you offer to do
 her homework, what?

491
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,389
- No, I just I said I
 thought she was really pretty

492
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,625
and that I wanted to kiss her.

493
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,529
I said I felt
 compelled to kiss her.

494
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,796
- And that worked?

495
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:00,265
- Yep.

496
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,934
- Wow, your first kiss.

497
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,435
- Nah, not my first.

498
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,671
Maryann Miller in the
 second grade used to kiss me

499
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,940
all the time, and she
was in the third grade.

500
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,142
- An older woman.

501
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:11,976
- Yeah.

502
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:12,810
- End of drill.

503
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,079
Come on, everyone back to class.

504
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:38,636
- Hey.

505
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:40,972
- [Anne] Hey.

506
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,674
- [Paul] Thanks for meeting me.

507
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,508
- It's fine.

508
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:47,545
Where's the Bob?

509
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,515
- His name is Bob, not the Bob,

510
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,217
and he had a meeting
 at the last minute.

511
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,318
- Oh.

512
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:54,152
Okay.

513
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,031
- New bookcase?

514
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,499
- Oh yeah, yeah.

515
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,235
Actually, that's
  how I met Michael.

516
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,971
I hired him to
 build me a bookcase.

517
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,877
- Jack still doesn't
 wanna see me?

518
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:20,712
- No.

519
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,214
He's 15.

520
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,650
He's trying to grow up.

521
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,887
You deserted him in more
ways than one, you know.

522
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,392
- Bob and I being together
doesn't mean I'm deserting Jack.

523
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,226
- Really?

524
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,830
I'll try telling him that.

525
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,731
You were his hero.

526
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,436
Life isn't as simple for
Jack as it is for you.

527
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,138
- Annie, with all due respect,

528
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:49,374
you have know idea
 what's simple for me.

529
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:50,341
- What do you want?

530
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:53,911
- For everything to be okay.

531
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,380
- What furniture do you want?

532
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,390
- I'll take the chair.

533
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,025
- What, that chair?

534
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:07,959
- No, no, no.
- It's my chair.

535
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,128
- No, no, I like that chair.

536
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,396
Jack likes that chair.

537
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:12,230
Take that chair.

538
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,700
- That chair, I hate that chair.

539
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,335
I've always hated that
 chair, you know that.

540
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:21,339
Couch?

541
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,147
Watch, watch.

542
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:32,150
- [Anne] I got it,
 I got it, I got it.

543
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,084
- Okay?

544
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:33,885
- [Anne] Here, wait a minute.

545
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:34,819
- One, two, three.

546
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,360
(sighing)

547
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,294
Okay, here.

548
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,562
- What?

549
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,230
- Come on, it's better
 to break up like that.

550
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,535
- Oh please.

551
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,506
- Do you remember how we met?

552
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,875
- Yeah, summer camp, I
  was nine, you were seven.

553
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:00,745
♪ Oh no, not you

554
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:03,648
♪ How kind you were

555
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,716
- Come on, seriously.

556
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,727
Anne, Annie.

557
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,730
- No, I remember.

558
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,332
Here, here.

559
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,669
You spilled coffee in my
book and lied about it.

560
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,838
- I didn't lie.

561
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:27,772
It was an accident.

562
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:29,741
I was nervous.

563
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,878
I was so in love with you.

564
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,648
(gentle music)

565
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:38,483
- This is yours.

566
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,786
- Annie, I need you
 to know something.

567
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,690
This has nothing to do with you.

568
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,492
- This has everything
 to do with me.

569
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,728
- It's my life, and
 you messed it up.

570
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,198
No, no, no,

571
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,700
no, you don't get to do that.

572
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,869
You don't dump on somebody
  and then comfort them.

573
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,270
It's just against the rules.

574
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,774
- Appreciate your
 helping out with Jack.

575
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:03,808
I know it's not easy.

576
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,444
(crying)

577
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:07,612
- It's worse than that.

578
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:11,716
I keep defending you,

579
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,317
and all I wanna do
  is strangle you.

580
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,222
(door opening)

581
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,324
(crying)

582
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:24,362
- Hi, Jack.

583
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,933
I came by to pick up a few
  things for the apartment.

584
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,671
Look, I know you don't
wanna spend time with me

585
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,240
right now, so,
  instead of dinner,

586
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,276
I thought maybe we
  could go bowling.

587
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,213
You know, a group
  activity might be better.

588
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,081
- No thanks.

589
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:45,516
- We can bring Max if you want.

590
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,587
There's also somebody I'd
  like to introduce you too.

591
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,290
The daughter of a friend
mine, Maggie Rogers.

592
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,060
- The Maggie Rogers?

593
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,963
- Well, I don't know if
it's The Maggie Rogers.

594
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,698
But I think she
 goes to your school.

595
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,903
Anyway, I thought we'd
 bowl a few rounds.

596
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:11,542
- Okay.

597
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:16,581
And it's games, you
bowl games, not rounds.

598
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,732
- [Jack Voiceover] As
much as I hated the idea

599
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,767
of being around my
 father and the Bob,

600
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,104
it was Maggie that
  made me do it.

601
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:40,938
- [Maggie] Hey, Jack.

602
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:41,772
- Hey.

603
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,241
- Max.

604
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,308
Five and a half, please.

605
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,776
- Full sizes only.

606
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:46,777
- Okay, six.

607
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:48,746
- No sixes.

608
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,516
Make it a seven.

609
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,618
- [Jack Voiceover] The minute
 I saw her, I turned green.

610
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:56,554
The only thing missing was
  the yearbook photographer.

611
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:57,788
- What size for you?

612
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:00,591
- Oh, I bowl in socks,
it gives me more slide.

613
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:01,559
- Right.

614
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,397
- So are you like
 alone here or what?

615
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,466
- No, that's my father.

616
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,771
- [Max] Who's the other guy?

617
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,173
- Why did I bring you?

618
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,341
- Because you like me,
 you like me very much.

619
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,712
Okay, everyone, let's
 take a practice round

620
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:22,780
and then we'll start.

621
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,689
- Burpa, that's what
  they call him, Max Burpa.

622
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,710
(cheering)

623
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,544
- That's my girl.

624
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,845
Go, Maggie, yeah.

625
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,047
- Okay, Jack, you're up.

626
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:06,023
- Way to go, Jack, make
 potholes, confuse everyone.

627
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,430
- Jack, next time try to
  keep your wrist straight.

628
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,131
- Bob, no advice, thanks.

629
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,411
- Isn't Maggie great?

630
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,946
- Great is an understatement.

631
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,186
- [Maggie] You've already
  had a hot dog, nachos

632
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,054
and a soda, and what else?

633
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,390
- I don't know, some Tootsie
 Rolls, if you're counting.

634
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:41,859
I can definitely
  go for ice cream.

635
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,663
Speaking of which,
  guess who's here.

636
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:46,964
- No idea.

637
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,232
- Okay, I'll rephrase.

638
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,968
For $200, guess which
 one of our schoolmates

639
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,737
bowls in a league.

640
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:53,604
- Eddie Hayes?

641
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,974
No way, that's so queer.

642
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:57,808
He's in a league?

643
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,417
(pins falling)

644
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,920
- Hey, we're going to the opera.

645
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,122
- [Paul] Well, what
 are you seeing?

646
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,157
- Carmen.
  - Carmen.

647
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:14,258
- [Bob] How'd you get tickets?

648
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:15,626
I thought it was sold out.

649
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,560
- It was, but you
  know John when he

650
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,662
sets his mind to something.

651
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:21,699
- Do you have a medical problem?

652
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,533
- Hmm?

653
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,338
- You know, they have drugs
 for people who are hyper.

654
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,106
- Yeah, you see, they
 thought he was hyper

655
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,641
but the tests came back normal.

656
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,011
- Maybe they should
 get him tested again.

657
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:37,114
- I am taking Jim to
 Provincetown for Memorial Day.

658
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:37,948
- Why?

659
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:38,783
- He's never been.

660
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:39,617
- Never?

661
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:41,986
- [Jack Voiceover] I was
  remembering the first time

662
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,487
I met the Bob.

663
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,456
About nine months
 after he moved out,

664
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,792
my dad and I were going
  on one of our adventures,

665
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,361
a boat trip to St.
  Michael's Island,

666
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,364
and my dad asked if he
 could bring a friend.

667
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,567
Had I known then what I
 know now, I woulda said no.

668
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,903
- Okay, anybody have any
 shoes they haven't returned.

669
00:38:58,903 --> 00:38:59,737
- [Jack] Yeah.

670
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,339
- [Maggie] I took
  mine back already.

671
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,141
- [Paul] Okay, I'll see
you guys at the car.

672
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,943
- See you, guys.
  - See you outside.

673
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:10,614
(clapping)

674
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,356
- Oh my God.

675
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,590
- Oh, gross.

676
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,558
- Am I seeing what
 I think I'm seeing?

677
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,293
- [Maggie] Gross, totally gross.

678
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,363
- Okay, was that artificial
 respiration or something?

679
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,865
Was there a reason for
 that, can you tell me?

680
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,100
- [Maggie] Shut
  up, just shut up.

681
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,668
Can you ever just not talk?

682
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,104
- He kissed the guy
  right on the mouth, okay.

683
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,572
Not on the cheek.

684
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,006
- Why do they have to
 make out in public?

685
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,476
Do your parents
 make out in public?

686
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,112
- No, no, actually my parents
 avoid touching at all times.

687
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,149
- [Jack Voiceover] This was
 the beginning of the end.

688
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,428
- Look, it's nothing to
go insane about, okay?

689
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,864
- You can use my locker
til it wears off.

690
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:03,667
- It's goddam
 black magic marker.

691
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,770
It's permanent, it
  doesn't wear off.

692
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:08,973
Did you do this?

693
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,040
- No, I didn't do it.

694
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:15,613
But maybe I accidentally

695
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:19,250
mentioned a bit about two guys
 kissing to a couple people.

696
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,751
Well, it freaked me out, okay?

697
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,455
I'm over it now.

698
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,892
I mean I get it, it's a
disease, okay, like a sickness.

699
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,593
Same as guys who chop people up,

700
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,662
put the pieces outta the house.

701
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:35,900
- You're completely
 mentally ill, you know that?

702
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:39,970
No!

703
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,272
Don't polish it.

704
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,850
Charming, at this rate,
 there will be a whole novel

705
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,452
up there by the end of the year.

706
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,763
- Talk to your
 girlfriend, fag baby.

707
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,231
- I don't know who
  you think you are.

708
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,233
I go bowling with you and
 your rodent friend as a favor,

709
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,568
and this is what happens?

710
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,102
- What is what happens?

711
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,004
I mean, I stupidly agree
to go bowling with you

712
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,840
and your queer bait
 father, and they write

713
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,242
fag baby on my locker.

714
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,543
- Look, this is my life,

715
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,679
and you and your friend
are like kamikazes.

716
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,050
- I have no idea what
 you're talking about.

717
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:30,621
- Ask the rodent.

718
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:42,333
- Okay, Maggie won't speak to
 me and she says you know why.

719
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,837
- There's been a small
 letter-writing accident, okay.

720
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,675
- What are you talking about?

721
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,544
- Someone circulated
 like a chain letter

722
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,713
to the whole school
about the bowling alley.

723
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,615
- Someone other than you?

724
00:41:58,582 --> 00:41:59,383
- Yeah.

725
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:01,252
- Eddie Hayes?

726
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:04,355
Okay, show me.

727
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,301
$25 to the one who
  first identifies

728
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,203
which beautiful babe and
 star of the basketball court

729
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,640
I spotted last night
 at a homosexual soiree

730
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,975
at the local 10-pin Lanes.

731
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,678
Post your answers on the
bulletin board in hall.

732
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,246
Name names, and receive money.

733
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,548
- Look, it'll be fine.

734
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:32,783
Okay, no one's
 gonna post anything.

735
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:34,718
- They wrote fag
  baby on my locker.

736
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,454
You don't think they'll
write a name for money?

737
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:38,689
- Yeah, well, they
 should've written it

738
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,357
on Maggie's locker, right,

739
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:41,892
because her dad's
  one of the fags.

740
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,762
But she's too cool.

741
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,697
- Oh, yeah, that makes
 me feel a lot better

742
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,165
except for one little thing.

743
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,503
Turns out my dad's a fag too.

744
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:53,337
- What?

745
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:56,740
- Shut up, shut up.

746
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,121
I feel sick.

747
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,389
- Don't worry, okay,
 it's the tater tots.

748
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:13,524
They're hard to digest.

749
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,226
How do you know your dad is,

750
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,631
you know, a fagola?

751
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,134
- He told me, okay, in a canoe.

752
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,739
And don't call him that.

753
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,175
And if you tell anyone,
I'm gonna torture you,

754
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,943
starting with your fingernails.

755
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,078
- Okay, all right.

756
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:52,830
- I have to go home.

757
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:56,800
- You have a fever?

758
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,068
You gonna faint?

759
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,470
- No, I just, I've
  had this before.

760
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,239
I just need to call my mom.

761
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,073
- Okay.

762
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,848
(dial tone)

763
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:13,517
(phone dialing)

764
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:18,055
- [Anne] Hello.

765
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:20,024
- Mrs. Stanford,
 this is Miss Morgan.

766
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:21,658
I'm the school nurse
 at Rolling Hills.

767
00:44:21,658 --> 00:44:25,829
I have Jack here in the office,
and he's not feeling well.

768
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,098
- Dizzy and nauseated.

769
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,400
- [Anne] Is he okay?

770
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:31,268
- Shall I put him on?

771
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:36,073
- You have to pick me up.

772
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,307
- [Anne] Are you really sick?

773
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,243
- Right now, Mom, you
 have to pick me up.

774
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,345
- [Anne] Jack?

775
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,849
- So shall we call this
a mental health moment?

776
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,419
- Call it whatever you want.

777
00:44:58,562 --> 00:44:59,463
- I hate children.

778
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,534
- Look, you can't
 go home, all right.

779
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,402
Don't leave me
 alone in this place.

780
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:07,938
- Yeah, you're right, I
don't need to go home.

781
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,975
I can move, like
 to another country.

782
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:36,734
(birds chirping)

783
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,845
- So what if your dad's queer?

784
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:48,679
I don't care.

785
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,949
- He sleeps with Bob.

786
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:54,017
They're lovers.

787
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:54,852
- So?

788
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:56,720
I sleep with my dog.

789
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:59,189
- It's not the same thing.

790
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,394
- Can I ask you a question?

791
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:05,195
- No.

792
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,264
- What do you think they do?

793
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,500
- Look, I don't know
and I don't wanna know.

794
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:14,037
- Look, maybe it's
 just a phase, okay.

795
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:16,140
He hasn't tried to
make you queer, has he?

796
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,342
- Max, it's not a phase, okay.

797
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,078
And you can't make
  a person queer.

798
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,679
They either are or they aren't.

799
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,283
(door opening)

800
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:28,519
- What's going on here?

801
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,021
- I'm waiting for my mom.

802
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:33,924
- And you?

803
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,259
- Waiting for his mom.

804
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,261
He's sick, I didn't
 wanna leave him alone.

805
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,929
In case he loses consciousness.

806
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:42,533
- Five minutes from now, I
  don't wanna see you here.

807
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:09,793
- You all right?

808
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:13,697
You got a sore throat?

809
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:18,035
Did something happen?

810
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,539
Your father called this morning.

811
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,208
Next Wednesday, instead
of going out to dinner,

812
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,742
he wants you to come
 to the apartment.

813
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:27,044
- No.

814
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,246
- [Anne] I told him you would.

815
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:31,682
- Mom, I've had enough
of the whole Dad thing.

816
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,418
I'm about two minutes
away from losing my mind

817
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:37,354
because they wrote
 fag baby on my locker.

818
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,388
- Kids are idiots.

819
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,324
Boy, you need a haircut.

820
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:41,959
- Both hands on
  the wheel please.

821
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,696
- You have hair just
 like your father's.

822
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,797
No matter what you do to it,

823
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:48,298
it wants to do something else.

824
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:52,769
- No, Mom, I am
 not like my father.

825
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:56,006
There is nothing about me
  that is like my father.

826
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,008
I don't wanna have
  dinner with him,

827
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,409
or see his apartment,

828
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:01,979
or spend quality time
 with his boyfriend.

829
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:05,148
Got it?

830
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,018
- Maggie's gonna be there.

831
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:12,122
- We're not speaking.

832
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,503
- Jack, I know the
 situation isn't easy.

833
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:28,205
Sometimes you have to
 wrestle with things

834
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,206
to make them fit.

835
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,610
Your father is not
 something to be ashamed of.

836
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,479
He realized things
 weren't working out,

837
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,180
and he did what he had to do.

838
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,882
Sometimes people spend
 their whole lives

839
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:41,485
trying to figure out
 what makes them happy.

840
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,753
- So are you happy?

841
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:46,523
- I might not be happy
 even if I were happy.

842
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:50,193
He took a risk.

843
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,031
Maybe you should
be proud of him.

844
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:57,534
- Oh come on, you don't even
 believe what you just said.

845
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,369
He wrecked everything.

846
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:01,305
It's not okay.

847
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:03,473
- I know.

848
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:06,043
What do you say we
 get some Ring Dings?

849
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,684
- [Jack] Hit her?

850
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:14,518
- [Anne] What?

851
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:15,786
- [Jack] Hit her.

852
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:20,524
- [Anne] Stop that.

853
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:24,161
- I'm not talking to you.

854
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,230
- Hi, I'm Anne, Jack's mom.

855
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,999
- Hi, Maggie, Maggie Rogers.

856
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:29,966
- Come on in.

857
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:31,635
- Mom, hello?

858
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,806
- I'm sorry I was harsh before.

859
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,143
Max is a total rodent,
 but, about the other stuff,

860
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:44,047
the letters and the
 locker, I'm sorry.

861
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:47,417
- But why me, it was your
father that was kissing the guy.

862
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,586
- I know, I overreacted
and I'm sorry.

863
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:54,224
- Unfortunately, I'm sorry
 doesn't remove magic marker.

864
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:56,860
- I can't control everything.

865
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:01,631
- So do your friends
 know about your dad?

866
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:05,469
Did he take you out in a
rowboat and confess too?

867
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:07,704
- Nope.

868
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,306
One day, there was just
some guy sleeping over.

869
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,809
- Yeah, my dad moved
 into the guestroom,

870
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,544
and then he moved out.

871
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,246
And I thought it was insomnia,

872
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,081
because he always had insomnia.

873
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,319
But one Saturday morning,
 he just took all this stuff

874
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,154
and started packing
 it in Hefty bags.

875
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:29,559
And all I kept saying was,
 Are we going to the movies?

876
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:33,130
Are we going to the movies?

877
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,699
Because we always used to go
 to the movies on Saturday.

878
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,669
And I knew something
horrible was happening.

879
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:40,871
I just didn't know what.

880
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,377
- So, uh,

881
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:51,515
is this gonna be
  something special?

882
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:53,016
- Yeah, it's gonna be a Zendo.

883
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,453
- Cool, Zendo,
 I've never seen one

884
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:57,888
in someone's backyard before.

885
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,825
- [Jack] You don't even
know what a Zendo is.

886
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:02,793
- Yes I do.

887
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,228
It's a place where people.

888
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,900
It's a place where people, like,

889
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:13,203
Jack, what do people
 do in a Zendo?

890
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:14,104
- They meditate.

891
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,507
Yeah, it's a place
 where people meditate.

892
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,210
- [Maggie] Cool.

893
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,144
- Yeah.

894
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,480
So are you like the poster child

895
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,849
for the well-adjusted
 gay dad club?

896
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,652
- It's not really
 like I have a choice.

897
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:34,024
Are you going to your dad's
 house for dinner next week?

898
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:34,858
- I don't know.

899
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:36,927
- I'll go if you go.

900
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:40,330
- Okay.

901
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:42,466
Sure.

902
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,271
- Do you wanna go to a movie?

903
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,473
- Now?

904
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:50,807
- No, like on
 Friday or something.

905
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:53,243
- Um, sure.

906
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:56,646
Yeah, okay, I guess I could go.

907
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:02,953
Do we dare be seen in public?

908
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,554
- Don't worry, I'll protect you.

909
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,257
Jack, you'll get used to it.

910
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:09,493
I did.

911
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:12,262
- No, I don't think I will.

912
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:14,865
(gentle music)

913
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,745
- [Anne] Elaine, look,
 can I call you back?

914
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:30,080
Great, bye-bye.

915
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,715
- I'm going, but
  I'm not gonna eat.

916
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,049
- Is that what you're wearing?

917
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,518
- It's what I wear to school.

918
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,320
- Don't you wanna get dressed up

919
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,755
for your father and Maggie?

920
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,223
- Maggie, yes, my father, no.

921
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,226
- Hey, what about
  meeting the Bob?

922
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:46,162
- Mom, I already met the
Bob when we went bowling

923
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,430
and once a long time ago.

924
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:49,566
- When a long time ago?

925
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,904
- When we went to St.
  Michael's Island with Dad.

926
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,238
Bob came along.

927
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:57,007
- Really, Bob was there?

928
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,041
I thought they just met.

929
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,676
- No, he's known
him for a while.

930
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,814
So do I have to change?

931
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:06,516
- I don't care, wear
 whatever you want.

932
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,688
- [Jack Voiceover] I
 was at his apartment,

933
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,024
and all I kept thinking
about was him being gay

934
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,559
and this being the place that he

935
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,060
and the Bob lived in together.

936
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:19,963
I wanted to puke.

937
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:21,865
That is, until I
 thought about Maggie.

938
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:26,036
(door buzzing)

939
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,641
- Hey, hi ya.

940
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:32,475
Welcome.

941
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,312
Dining room, Bob, Jack's here.

942
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,680
That's the kitchen.

943
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,983
Let me show you this room.

944
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:40,817
With a view.

945
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:44,888
Sofa looks pretty
 good here, doesn't it?

946
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,357
- Yeah, is that the
 chair that used to be

947
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:48,858
in the living room?

948
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,060
- That's the chair that used
 to be in the living room.

949
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,561
That's the coffee
 table that I built you

950
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,796
when you were little.

951
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,364
You've heard that story before.

952
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:56,099
- Hi, Jack.

953
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,606
- Nice slippers.

954
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:05,642
- Oh, thanks, I picked
 them up at an antique fair.

955
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,510
I think they may have
belonged to Greta Garbo.

956
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,279
At least that's what
 the guy told me.

957
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:13,850
I'll go check the oven.

958
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:19,222
- Come on, I wanna
  show you the view.

959
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:31,668
Not bad, huh?

960
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:37,974
Listen, Jack, I
  was hoping I could

961
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:40,377
come to your game,
  if that's okay.

962
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:42,445
- Okay, where's Maggie?

963
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,183
- She should be here any minute.

964
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,655
(door buzzing)

965
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:52,489
There you go.

966
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,028
- Hi, hi, hi.

967
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:58,895
Come on in, Maggie.

968
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,431
You look wonderful, John.

969
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:03,366
Nice to see you.

970
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:04,668
- Hi.
 - Hi.

971
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:07,203
- Jack, we'll only be
 able to stay a minute.

972
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:08,905
- Hey, how are you?

973
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:09,939
Hello, dear, how are you?

974
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:11,975
Come in, come.

975
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,946
- [Bob] Dinner's just
 about ready, guys.

976
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:17,781
- Okay.

977
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,618
- I'm not hungry,
 I'd like to go home.

978
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:26,756
- Bob worked very
 hard on this dinner.

979
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:28,024
You'll hurt his feelings.

980
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,227
- I don't care
 about his feelings.

981
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:32,328
I don't even know him.

982
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,666
I mean, shouldn't you care more
about my feelings than his?

983
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,867
Didn't I come first?

984
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:40,937
- You know I care
 about your feelings.

985
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:42,872
Then why are you
  doing this to me?

986
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:44,407
- I'm not doing anything to you.

987
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:46,209
- Well then who are
 you doing it to?

988
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,619
- Jack, who I am,

989
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,055
and who I love

990
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:01,858
is about me.

991
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05,161
It is not about you.

992
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:07,797
- Well then how come they
 call me fag baby at school?

993
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:16,206
- Do you want me
to talk to them?

994
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,708
- Like what, have
  a school assembly?

995
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,177
Okay, everybody, Jack's
 father is here to talk about

996
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:24,714
homosexuality and why we
shouldn't call his son fag baby.

997
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:26,716
Come on.

998
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:30,320
- Okay, you're right.

999
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:33,990
You have every
  right to be upset.

1000
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,328
Is there anything
  I can do to help?

1001
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:40,096
- You can help me
  by not being gay.

1002
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,733
- I wish I could do that, but I,

1003
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:48,605
you know, it would make
my life easier too.

1004
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,473
- Well then just do
 it, do it for me.

1005
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,945
- I can't do that, Jack.

1006
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:57,280
- Then I'd like to go home.

1007
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,384
- Hey, dinner's ready.

1008
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,821
- Bob, Jack's not
  feeling that well.

1009
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,456
I'm gonna drive him home.

1010
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:07,290
- Oh.

1011
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,758
- I feel fine.

1012
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,527
I just don't wanna be
  here with the two of you.

1013
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:46,930
- You were incredibly
 rude to Bob tonight.

1014
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,331
You know better than that.

1015
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:49,132
Wasn't right.

1016
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:55,605
- You go and do this thing
 of yours, you find yourself

1017
00:57:55,605 --> 00:58:00,210
or whatever, and then, you
  expect everybody to knock

1018
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:04,180
themselves out understanding it.

1019
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,281
None of that is right.

1020
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:10,787
- Jack.

1021
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:11,621
Jack.

1022
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,175
- [Anne] What happened?

1023
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,112
- He's mad about me,
 he's mad about Bob.

1024
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,216
I don't know what to do.

1025
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:41,217
- Can you blame him?

1026
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:45,255
- What happened to
  my great defender?

1027
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,089
- She quit.

1028
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:03,740
(cheerleaders cheering)

1029
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:07,977
- Hey, hi guys, where's Steve?

1030
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:09,779
- He's working late, new client.

1031
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:11,481
Hi, Michael, how's it going?

1032
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,583
- Oh, it goes and I go with it.

1033
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,718
- Why do I think
  everyone's looking at me?

1034
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,787
- You may think that they
  are all looking at you,

1035
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:18,621
but they are not.

1036
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:20,356
- I know, I know.

1037
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:21,858
Oh my God, he showed up.

1038
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:22,692
Hi.

1039
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:25,261
They're not gonna sit
 with us, are they?

1040
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:28,164
- No, they're not
  gonna sit with us.

1041
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,769
(cheering and booing)

1042
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:43,112
(cheering)

1043
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:45,882
(dramatic music)

1044
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:11,574
(whistle blowing)

1045
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:14,177
(upbeat music)

1046
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:18,481
(cheering)

1047
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:21,451
(cheering)

1048
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:24,020
(upbeat music)

1049
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:38,434
(cheering and booing)

1050
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:41,037
(upbeat music)

1051
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:51,514
(whistle blowing)

1052
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:54,851
(cheerleaders cheering)

1053
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,312
- [Coach] It's your foot?

1054
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:24,547
- Yeah.

1055
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:25,615
- [Coach] Do you think
 you can stand on it?

1056
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:27,517
- [Jack] I'm not sure.

1057
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,253
- [Coach] I'll have
 to take a look.

1058
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:34,791
- Ow, ow.

1059
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:37,927
(applause)

1060
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:04,487
(whistle blowing)

1061
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,055
- [Jack Voiceover]
  Life is funny.

1062
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,624
One minute, I was running
 to the cheers of the crowd,

1063
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:10,693
and the next I was being
wheeled down a hall

1064
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:13,729
on a gurney by my parents
  and their boyfriends.

1065
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:15,264
- You were playing beautifully.

1066
01:02:18,734 --> 01:02:19,802
- Who belongs to who?

1067
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,672
We can't have a thousand
people back here,

1068
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:23,773
immediate family only.

1069
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:26,375
- We're the parents.

1070
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,778
- Pick any two, the rest can
 stay in the waiting room.

1071
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:36,452
- Who's in charge here?

1072
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:41,624
Well, there's, uh,
  nothing broken,

1073
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,594
but you do have a
  very bad sprain.

1074
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,597
I'd like to have an air
  cast and crutches, please.

1075
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,700
Now, I'd like you to keep
  this elevated tonight

1076
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,268
and all day tomorrow.

1077
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:55,538
I want you to have ice on it
 30 minutes out of every hour.

1078
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,573
Any problems, give me a call.

1079
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:59,675
- What about basketball?

1080
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:02,411
- Well, I think you better
 learn to walk before you run.

1081
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:12,155
- Maybe we shouldn't have
  all gone to the game.

1082
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:14,724
Maybe it ruined
 your concentration.

1083
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,259
- It's not your fault.

1084
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:19,662
My leg just got tangled with
 the other guy's, that's it.

1085
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,299
- Hey, kiddo, you got messages.

1086
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,268
Your coach, Maggie, and Elaine.

1087
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:26,936
She said she'll come over
  during the day tomorrow

1088
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,571
and hang out with you
  while everyone's at work.

1089
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:29,772
- Oh that's so nice.

1090
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:30,606
She adores you.

1091
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,975
She thinks you're very special.

1092
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,711
- I am very special.

1093
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:38,881
- I know, but it's nice when
 someone else agrees with you.

1094
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:44,487
- Mom?

1095
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,022
- Mm?

1096
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:49,559
- What's it mean when your
father picks a boring boyfriend?

1097
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:52,328
- That he had a lapse
 in judgment after us.

1098
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:56,699
- That's what I thought.

1099
01:03:58,834 --> 01:03:59,669
- Enough?

1100
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:00,469
- Thank you.

1101
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:01,637
- You're welcome.

1102
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:08,010
(birds chirping)

1103
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:16,285
- You look very pale.

1104
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,321
- I feel very pale.

1105
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:20,756
- Do you want another pill?

1106
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:21,591
- No thanks.

1107
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:25,161
- [Jack Voiceover] If she
  hadn't been Mrs. Burka,

1108
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:28,064
Max's mother, I would
  have asked her to do that

1109
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:30,066
to my whole body
  for hours on end.

1110
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,569
I wondered if she knew how
  she was making me feel.

1111
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,005
- That feels good.

1112
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,776
- Well, I better run.

1113
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:45,248
I told Steve I'd be
 home, and you know how

1114
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,049
he gets if everything
 isn't perfect.

1115
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:50,586
You rest a while longer, okay?

1116
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:52,088
Your mom's gonna be home soon.

1117
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:05,835
(birds chirping)

1118
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,939
- Oh, hey.

1119
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:12,575
- So, are you like down
for the count or what?

1120
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,676
- Down, but not out

1121
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:16,912
- Hey, well, I
 brought you a present.

1122
01:05:16,912 --> 01:05:18,047
- Yeah, what, homework?

1123
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:19,915
- Ta-da.

1124
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,251
- Hi.

1125
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:25,688
- Hi.

1126
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:26,956
- I hope you're not out.

1127
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:28,624
I'm really looking
  forward to Friday.

1128
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:30,326
I assume you're still free?

1129
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,028
- Free but crippled.

1130
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:33,929
- Well, what's happening Friday?

1131
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:35,765
- We have a date.

1132
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:37,667
- Really?

1133
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,402
Well, uh, can I come?

1134
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:41,704
- No, Max, because then
it wouldn't be a date.

1135
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,808
- Anyways, I'm gonna be
late, piano lesson day.

1136
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:55,851
(soft music)

1137
01:05:55,851 --> 01:05:56,986
- Did you see that?

1138
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:58,688
She just kissed you.

1139
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:00,690
That's like the second
time in recent history.

1140
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,159
Well this is better than TV.

1141
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:04,927
I'm watching you
 go through puberty.

1142
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:14,804
- So, uh, what do
  you do in a Zendo?

1143
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:18,307
Just sit and wait?

1144
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:21,110
- No waiting, just sitting.

1145
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:24,380
- And then what?

1146
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,214
- Nothing.

1147
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,384
- I don't get it.

1148
01:06:28,384 --> 01:06:30,486
- Well there's nothing
to get, nothing happens.

1149
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:33,556
But if you do it enough,
you get yourself.

1150
01:06:36,992 --> 01:06:37,827
- Okay.

1151
01:06:42,998 --> 01:06:45,401
(soft music)

1152
01:06:57,747 --> 01:07:00,883
- [Jack] So how many times
  have you seen that film?

1153
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:01,817
- Like two million.

1154
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:03,753
- Yeah.

1155
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:07,323
My dad used to take me to
  the movies every Saturday.

1156
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:09,325
- Mine did too, maybe it's like

1157
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:10,793
a gay dad thing or something.

1158
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,363
I'm kidding.

1159
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,803
- So is it better or
 worse to be a girl

1160
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,171
or a guy with a gay dad?

1161
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,575
- I think it's worse for a guy.

1162
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:28,611
It's more threatening or
something, I don't know.

1163
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:30,980
- Yeah, I have to say,
 when he first told me,

1164
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,182
I kept thinking, Does
 that mean I'm gay too?

1165
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:35,117
- And now?

1166
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,155
- Oh, now I'm sure I'm not gay.

1167
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,062
So how come you never
 talk about your mom?

1168
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,232
- Because she's not around.

1169
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:52,468
- Is she dead?

1170
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,304
- No, she lives in Virginia.

1171
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:01,277
Three years ago, she invited
 me to come and visit,

1172
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:04,814
and I remember I spent the
  whole summer baby-sitting

1173
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:07,716
her two new kids while she
  went off with her friends

1174
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:08,851
and got her nails done.

1175
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:14,190
She's got a new
 life, a new husband,

1176
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:17,126
and as far as she's concerned,
 my dad and I are just

1177
01:08:17,126 --> 01:08:18,828
mistakes she made
  a long time ago.

1178
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:21,530
- But she's your mom, right?

1179
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,364
- Yeah.

1180
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:25,968
Then she got annoyed about
  something, threw her stuff

1181
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:27,203
in the back of a car and,

1182
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:29,138
never came back.

1183
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:32,208
- How old were you?

1184
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,008
- Six.

1185
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:38,714
And I remember, I
thought it was my fault,

1186
01:08:38,714 --> 01:08:41,917
like I thought I had
 done something wrong.

1187
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:43,686
- Yeah, I thought
  I was too boring.

1188
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:55,464
Good night.

1189
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:56,365
- Can you get out?

1190
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:57,666
- I can try.

1191
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,902
(giggling)

1192
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:04,106
- Thank you.

1193
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:04,974
- Welcome.

1194
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,242
- [Michael] Hey.

1195
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,511
- Sorry about that, we
 just started talking.

1196
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:10,412
- Oh, that's all right.

1197
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:12,515
So you want me to drive
you guys somewhere

1198
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:14,116
where you can make
  out or something?

1199
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:17,052
- Michael, it's our
 first date, okay?

1200
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:19,488
- Geez, kids today,
you're damned if you do,

1201
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,489
damned if you don't.

1202
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,359
- Sorry about that.

1203
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:24,360
- Thank you.

1204
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:31,667
(car starting)

1205
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:41,810
- Thank you.

1206
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:42,645
- You're welcome.

1207
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:48,684
- So, um, I guess I'll
 phone you tomorrow.

1208
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:49,618
- Okay.

1209
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:50,686
- [Maggie] Okay, thank you.

1210
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:51,520
- Bye.

1211
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,354
- [Maggie] Bye.

1212
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:01,764
- So?

1213
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:05,834
- Well, if I'd known
 dating was that easy,

1214
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,703
I woulda started
 when I was like two.

1215
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:14,944
We watched the film,
 I held her hand,

1216
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:19,214
and her hand was sweaty,
and my hand was sweaty,

1217
01:10:19,214 --> 01:10:21,383
and our sweat just
  kind of mixed.

1218
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:25,254
And then we had ice cream,

1219
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:27,590
and the vanilla melted
with the chocolate, and,

1220
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:31,961
it was all just
  kind of fantastic.

1221
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,564
- Yeah, I'll bet it was.

1222
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:38,167
(car starting)

1223
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:43,038
- You got enough warm clothes?

1224
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:43,872
- Yeah.

1225
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:44,707
- You got money?

1226
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:46,008
- Yep.

1227
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:47,309
- It was very nice of
 Elaine to invite you.

1228
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:48,210
- Yeah, I know, I'm
 Max's entertainment.

1229
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:50,679
- Have a good time.

1230
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:52,248
- [Jack] Bye.

1231
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,082
- Bye.

1232
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:03,792
(tires squealing)

1233
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:05,561
(horn honking)

1234
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:06,495
- If someone could
  read the signs,

1235
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,630
we'd know where to get off.

1236
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:12,568
- Steve, this is not my
 fault, you're driving the car.

1237
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:13,669
- That's what you say.

1238
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:18,240
- [Jack Voiceover] Something
 about Mr. Burka swerving

1239
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,642
made me think of Mr. Bailey.

1240
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:23,045
Swerving on a highway
 was definitely not

1241
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:25,547
a Mr. Bailey thing to do.

1242
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:28,651
Made me think of him asking,
 Had my parents crashed?

1243
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:50,339
- [Elaine] Dinner with
  Uncle Morris and Aunt Mary

1244
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:52,675
is 7:30, and they're looking
 forward to seeing you.

1245
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:55,244
- [Steve] Did they write
  seeing you or soaking you?

1246
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:56,078
Every time we go out
 to dinner with them,

1247
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:57,913
I have to pay the check.

1248
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:00,149
- [Elaine] So just decide
  that this time you won't.

1249
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,421
- [Steve] I grew
up on this lake.

1250
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:06,889
I bet you didn't
know that, Jack.

1251
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:09,358
Almost drowned in
  this bad boy once.

1252
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:10,959
- [Max] Every year,
 he tells us about

1253
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:12,761
how he almost drowned.

1254
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:13,996
- [Steve] You know,
 it means something

1255
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:15,931
to have a place to come back to

1256
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:18,500
- People always feel the
  need to confess on a lake.

1257
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:21,603
I myself don't
 like lakes anymore.

1258
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:23,272
They're overrated.

1259
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:25,140
- Boy, this is the life, huh?

1260
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,309
Million miles away
  from everything.

1261
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:28,343
- Million years away.

1262
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:31,080
- No littering please.

1263
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,715
- Feeding the fish.

1264
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:34,516
- Hey, Captain,
 toss me those chips.

1265
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,421
- [Sam] What's a
  lake made out of?

1266
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:42,091
- [Elaine] Oh, a lake's
  like a really big puddle.

1267
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:44,660
- [Sam] Well, what's a
 mountain made out of?

1268
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,495
- [Elaine] Mountain's
 like a big rock.

1269
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:48,263
- [Sam] Do rocks grow?

1270
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:50,065
- [Max] Only in your head.

1271
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:50,899
- [Elaine] Max.

1272
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:55,170
(murmuring)

1273
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:58,040
- Uh, could I have
  some more ketchup?

1274
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:01,844
(murmuring)

1275
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:04,480
- Hey, Honey, can I get
a refill here, thanks?

1276
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:06,348
- Any time of day.

1277
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:09,284
We've called him on emergencies.

1278
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:11,620
- So, how goes it in the market?

1279
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:12,454
Any tips?

1280
01:13:13,388 --> 01:13:15,023
- No tips.

1281
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:17,392
Only top-secret insight
I'm not privy to share.

1282
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:25,234
What do I owe you
 for Mary and myself?

1283
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:28,771
- It's okay, Morris,
 we'll split it 50-50.

1284
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:30,606
- But they've got
 three extra people.

1285
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:35,744
- In the morning, I want you
 all to come down to the house,

1286
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:37,846
and I'll make you up
 a nice big breakfast.

1287
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:39,548
- You know, I got this.

1288
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:43,018
Whole, half, what's
 the difference?

1289
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:45,654
- What pleases you
  pleases the court.

1290
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:49,324
- Maybe next time, Morris.

1291
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:51,126
- Sweetie, thank
 you for everything.

1292
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,502
- [Jack] It's very
  old-fashioned.

1293
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:02,538
- [Max] Yeah, like prison.

1294
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:03,672
- [Jack] No, I like it.

1295
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:07,242
(door opening)

1296
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:09,778
- [Elaine] Well you
 boys sleep well.

1297
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,415
Is everything okay?

1298
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:14,683
- [Max] Mm-hmm.

1299
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:16,618
- [Elaine] Good night, Jack.

1300
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:20,055
- [Jack] Love you.

1301
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:26,795
- What was that, I love you?

1302
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:29,898
- I don't know, it
just kinda slipped out.

1303
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:36,238
- [Steve] Only top-secret
  insight I am not privy to.

1304
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:37,072
What an ass.

1305
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,676
- [Elaine] Honey, you
 could have split the check.

1306
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:41,510
- [Steve] What are
 you always on me for?

1307
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:42,744
This is my vacation.

1308
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:44,313
Why can't I relax
  for 10 seconds?

1309
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,547
So what if I pick up the check?

1310
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:46,481
- [Elaine] Well you're
 the one who said

1311
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:47,916
you always getting soaked.

1312
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:49,818
- [Steve] Can't I complain
without you throwing it my face?

1313
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:51,820
You know what,
  no, you know what?

1314
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:55,657
Maybe the problem is you.

1315
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:03,332
- We should get pneumonia
  not to hear them?

1316
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,435
- Is this normal?

1317
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:07,769
- It may not be normal, but

1318
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:10,706
they do it all the time.

1319
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:13,175
- [Steve] I am so sick
 of being criticized.

1320
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,944
Not one thing I do is
right, according to you.

1321
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:19,047
No no, shut up,
 Elaine, just shut up!

1322
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:22,317
- We can hear you!

1323
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:26,822
- [Jack Voiceover] Even
the clanking of the fan

1324
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:28,824
couldn't get their
 voices outta my head.

1325
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,328
I closed my eyes, trying
 to think of something else,

1326
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:35,998
anything else.

1327
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:40,302
(Steve yelling)

1328
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,022
- [Sam] I told you
  he was sleeping.

1329
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:01,290
- Pack up, we're outta here.

1330
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,326
We're leaving, get up.

1331
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:06,962
- Where are we going?

1332
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:07,796
- Home.

1333
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:10,666
My father beat up my mom, okay.

1334
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,834
He hauled off and slugged her.

1335
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:16,338
Well, my dad once threw a
  box of donuts at my mom,

1336
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:18,507
and they went flying everywhere.

1337
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:19,875
- Pack, you idiot.

1338
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:20,876
- [Sam] Where's Dad?

1339
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:22,911
- What an asshole.

1340
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:25,514
This isn't the first
 time, you know.

1341
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:27,349
- [Sam] I want my dad.

1342
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:29,017
(door opening)

1343
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:30,519
- Okay, so we have everything?

1344
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:34,289
- Where's my dad?

1345
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,159
- He went for a walk
 with your uncle.

1346
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:40,862
- I'll put the stuff in the car.

1347
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:41,697
- Okay.

1348
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:54,009
- [Jack Voiceover] It was
  nothing like when my dad

1349
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:57,479
threw the donuts, it
 was 1,000 times worse.

1350
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:00,749
Everything that had
 happened to my family

1351
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:03,552
and everything that I'd
  ever felt about the Burkas

1352
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:06,855
or anyone else was spilling
 out all over the place,

1353
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:09,424
and I didn't know
  how to stop it.

1354
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:14,930
(gentle music)

1355
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:57,105
- Here, you boys go and get
 yourself something, okay?

1356
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:11,286
- [Jack Voiceover] I
had this image of myself

1357
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:13,989
as a grown-up, sitting
 in the car with her,

1358
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:15,657
while the kids
  were in the store.

1359
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:19,728
I guess I just didn't
  think she should be alone.

1360
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:22,397
I guess I wanted to protect her.

1361
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:24,800
- Why don't you go on onside,

1362
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,301
see if something
  catches your eye?

1363
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:35,610
- I don't know what to say.

1364
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:39,481
- You don't have
to say anything.

1365
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:51,626
(door closing)

1366
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:04,606
(crying)

1367
01:19:28,396 --> 01:19:29,498
(dial tone)

1368
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:32,167

(phone ringing)

1373
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:42,244
- [Anne On Answering Machine]
 We're not home right now,

01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,813
but leave your name and
 number, we'll call you back.

- [Jack] Jack.

1381
01:19:57,592 --> 01:19:59,127
(phone ringing)

1382
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:01,730
- [Recording] You have a
collect call from Jack.

1383
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,999
Will you accept
 charges, press one.

1384
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:04,833
- [Paul] Jack?

1385
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,334
- Yeah, Dad, press one.

1386
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:07,335
(beeping)

1387
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:08,203
- [Paul] Jack, hello.

1388
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:09,237
- Dad?

1389
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:10,438
- [Paul] Jack?

1390
01:20:10,438 --> 01:20:11,640
Is everything all right?

1391
01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:15,677
- Mr. Burka hit Mrs. Burka.

1392
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:18,780
- [Paul] What do you mean, Jack?

1393
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,182
- Hit her, you know, hit her,

1394
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:22,617
like in a boxing match
 only without a ring.

1395
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:26,321
- [Paul] Oh, is
  Elaine all right?

1396
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:29,391
- [Jack] No, I mean,
  she's driving but her face

1397
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:31,059
looks like a hamburger.

1398
01:20:31,059 --> 01:20:32,527
- [Paul] I'll meet
  you at the Burkas.

1399
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:35,764
Just keep it together
  until you get there, okay?

1400
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:37,365
- Okay.

1401
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:38,466
Dad?

1402
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:40,001
- [Paul] Yeah, yeah.

1403
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:41,736
- Promise you'll pick me up.

1404
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:43,104
- [Paul] I promise,
 I'll be there.

1405
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:52,547
- [Jack Voiceover] I
realized at that moment

1406
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:54,516
that there were only
  three people in the world

1407
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:55,584
that I could turn to.

1408
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:59,888
Mrs. Burka, who couldn't
help anyone right now.

1409
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:02,190
My mother, who wasn't home.

1410
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:03,959
And my father, who was.

1411
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:06,294
- Hey.

1412
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:09,531
Did you guys get
 everything you wanted?

1413
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:13,568
- Yeah, yeah, we're
 fine, let's just go.

1414
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:16,304
- I got you a present.

1415
01:21:20,809 --> 01:21:21,810
- Thank you, Jack.

1416
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,984
(car starting)

1417
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:33,488
(gentle music)

1418
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:03,018
- [Max] How come he's here?

1419
01:22:03,018 --> 01:22:04,819
- [Jack] Because I called him.

1420
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:08,690
- [Max] What did you
do, send smoke signals?

1421
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:12,560
- [Paul] Are you all right?

1422
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,895
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1423
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:19,167
- [Anne] Did you
call the police?

1424
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:20,969
- He didn't mean it,
he just, he gets angry.

1425
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:22,170
- Help them out with the bags.

1426
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:23,371
Are you expecting him
 back today or not?

1427
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:24,406
- I don't know, I
 think he's gonna stay

1428
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:25,640
with his family for a few days.

1429
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,008
- Come on, boys,
  come on, come on.

1430
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:27,942
- Come on, let's put
 some ice on that.

1431
01:22:27,942 --> 01:22:28,677
Do you think anything's broken?

1432
01:22:28,677 --> 01:22:29,511
- No, it's.

1433
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:30,745
- Are you sure?

1434
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:32,480
- It's fine, it's
 bruised, not broken.

1435
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:35,750
- Listen, if you mention
 one word of this to anyone,

1436
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,385
I will have you taken care of.

1437
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:38,820
- Taken care of?

1438
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,922
- Yeah, I will kill you,
 okay, I will have you killed.

1439
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:44,125
- Max, hello, it's me, Jack.

1440
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:45,660
Jack, your best friend.

1441
01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:49,331
Okay, first of all,
 you're scaring me.

1442
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:50,865
Second of all, you're
 acting demented.

1443
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:53,268
And third of all, if you
don't start acting nicer

1444
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:56,104
to your own mom
 I'm gonna kill you.

1445
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:58,873
(birds chirping)

1446
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,847
- I keep trying to imagine
 Mr. Burka hitting Mrs. Burka.

1447
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:09,918
And every time I come close
 to the moment when something

1448
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:12,854
bad happens, my
  mind just freezes.

1449
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:17,992
Mr. B hitting Mrs. B.

1450
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,095
- Pretty scary.

1451
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:25,700
- I imagine myself
  older, bigger,

1452
01:23:27,035 --> 01:23:30,338
blocking at Mr. Burka's
punch with one arm,

1453
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:35,343
knocking him out with the other.

1454
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:42,517
- Hey, Max.

1455
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:43,351
- [Max] Hey.

1456
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:51,092
- How's your mom doing?

1457
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:54,229
- She looks like she got
 her face put in a Cuisinart.

1458
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:58,666
- Look, Bob and I are having
 some people over next Saturday

1459
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:00,368
for brunch, why
 don't you two come?

1460
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:03,171
- Look, I may have called you,

1461
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:06,074
but I still don't wanna
hang out with you.

1462
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:08,109
- Oh, I know you don't
wanna hang out with me.

1463
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:11,212
But Maggie Rogers
  was coming, so.

1464
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:13,014
- Sure, for how
 long, five minutes?

1465
01:24:13,014 --> 01:24:14,315
- No, for the whole thing.

1466
01:24:19,254 --> 01:24:20,755
- That's not fair.

1467
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:24,225
Come on, that's
  flat-out bribery.

1468
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:26,161
You know I'm weak
 when it comes to her.

1469
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:29,731
- So, are you coming or not?

1470
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:35,437
- Yeah.

1471
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:36,471
- Good.

1472
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:38,473
Max, you, little football?

1473
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:41,309
Come on, here we go.

1474
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:42,510
- No, my leg, can't.

1475
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:43,478
- Okay, come on.

1476
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:44,512
Gannon, to Rice.

1477
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:53,988
(crying)

1478
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:55,457
- What am I gonna do?

1479
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:56,858
- You're gonna take care
of yourself for once.

1480
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:59,060
That's what you're gonna do.

1481
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:02,931
- What about the kids?

1482
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:07,402
- The kids don't wanna
see you get hit anymore.

1483
01:25:09,704 --> 01:25:11,773
(crying)

1484
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,378
- Jack gave me this.

1485
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:20,515
He just.

1486
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:22,584
(crying)

1487
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:30,592
Anne, I'm so scared.

1488
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,895
(soft music)

1489
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:43,738
(crying)

1490
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:50,812
(Paul yelling)

1491
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:56,651
(upbeat music)

1492
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:57,752
- You must be Jack.

1493
01:25:57,752 --> 01:25:59,988
You look just like your father.

1494
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,890
How's school? I hear
 so much about you.

1495
01:26:03,157 --> 01:26:05,260
- Um, actually I'm Max.

1496
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:09,430
That's Jack right there.

1497
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:13,001
- [Maggie] Let's go.

1498
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:30,018
I think that woman who
 cornered Max is Bob's shrink.

1499
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:31,920
- I didn't know that
 Bob had a shrink.

1500
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,255
- Yeah, my Dad took me to
  see him a couple times.

1501
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:39,460
Did I mention that I
hate my dad's boyfriend?

1502
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:43,231
Okay, he clips his toenails
 and then he eats the pieces.

1503
01:26:43,231 --> 01:26:45,166
I caught him doing it when he
 thought no one was looking.

1504
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:47,101
Isn't that disgusting?

1505
01:26:47,101 --> 01:26:47,936
- Yeah.

1506
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:48,770
- Ugh.

1507
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:52,640
- Don't you wish your dad
  would just find some girl,

1508
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,510
get married and then
 all this would stop?

1509
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:57,111
- No, I'd be totally jealous.

1510
01:26:58,146 --> 01:26:58,980
- Oh.

1511
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:07,889
So, can I kiss you?

1512
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:08,690
- No.

1513
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:10,558
- Why not?

1514
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:11,593
- Because you kiss everyone.

1515
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:12,794
- I do not.

1516
01:27:12,794 --> 01:27:14,896
- Come on, I saw you with Jenny.

1517
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:16,431
- Yeah, but that was different.

1518
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:17,265
- Oh.

1519
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:20,001
- It was.

1520
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:21,703
And besides, you kissed
me the other day,

1521
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:23,538
so that's where I got the idea.

1522
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:24,973
- Yeah, but you were injured.

1523
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:27,108
And you've gotta wait
 til you earn my trust,

1524
01:27:27,108 --> 01:27:28,343
and then you can kiss me.

1525
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:31,846
- Okay.

1526
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:32,914
- Okay.

1527
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:33,748
- Yeah.

1528
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:40,421
- Hey, do you think Max is okay?

1529
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:41,589
- No.

1530
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:43,858
(giggling)

1531
01:27:45,059 --> 01:27:46,628
(retching)

1532
01:27:46,628 --> 01:27:47,428
- [Jack] Max?

1533
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:51,332
Max!

1534
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:53,434
- What?

1535
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:56,804
- Ew, are you stuck?

1536
01:27:58,973 --> 01:27:59,807
- [Max] No.

1537
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:02,777
- Hey, are you okay?

1538
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:04,579
Why are you throwing
 up into a trash chute

1539
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:06,914
into a restroom like
 a normal person?

1540
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:09,450
- Um, can we get you some
  seltzer or something?

1541
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:10,718
- Yeah, that'd be great.

1542
01:28:10,718 --> 01:28:11,986
Why don't you go get it?

1543
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:12,820
- Okay.

1544
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:18,159
- What is wrong with you?

1545
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,536
Okay, why do I feel like I'm
 seeing tomorrow's headlines,

1546
01:28:28,536 --> 01:28:30,638
teenager dies at
  homosexual brunch?

1547
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:34,809
This is totally pathetic, Max.

1548
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:37,178
Oh, what are you gonna
do, you're gonna hit me?

1549
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:40,615
- Look, just leave
  me alone, okay.

1550
01:28:40,615 --> 01:28:42,150
I'm not doing anything,
 it's none of your business.

1551
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,818
- Oh, it's none of my
business, and that's why

1552
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:45,320
you're doing it at
  my dad's apartment

1553
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,021
instead of your
  own goddam house.

1554
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:49,691
- There's no one at my
  house, asshole, remember?

1555
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:52,960
- You're driving me crazy, Max.

1556
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,229
- No, no no no, you're
 driving me crazy.

1557
01:28:55,229 --> 01:28:57,732
- Okay, look, your
life is a complete mess

1558
01:28:57,732 --> 01:28:59,467
but you don't have to
 make it a bigger drama

1559
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:00,468
than it already is.

1560
01:29:01,636 --> 01:29:04,038
- Look who's talking,
okay, you have no idea.

1561
01:29:06,307 --> 01:29:08,042
Have you ever seen
 your parents fight?

1562
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:09,243
Huh?

1563
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:11,212
Literally haul off
 and punch each other?

1564
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:15,216
If you ever heard the kinds
 of things my parents say

1565
01:29:15,216 --> 01:29:16,451
to each other, you'd die.

1566
01:29:17,985 --> 01:29:20,588
I mean, they hate
  each other, okay.

1567
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:22,957
And right now, I
  hate both of them.

1568
01:29:25,126 --> 01:29:26,594
How do you think
 that makes me feel?

1569
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:31,299
- Look, Max, you're
 not your father.

1570
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:33,968
You're not your
 mother, you're you.

1571
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:36,804
And you have to take
 care of yourself,

1572
01:29:36,804 --> 01:29:38,906
and you have to
  protect yourself,

1573
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:40,908
and you have to find
 a way through this.

1574
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:44,545
And, okay, you can't fix
it, but it doesn't mean

1575
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:46,514
you should wreck
 your own life either.

1576
01:29:46,514 --> 01:29:48,716
- This coming from someone
  who hates his own father.

1577
01:29:52,186 --> 01:29:55,356
I'd trade my dad with
 yours in a second.

1578
01:29:55,356 --> 01:29:57,024
- No, Max, you can't do that.

1579
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:59,160
You don't trade one set
of problems for another.

1580
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,828
- Who says?

1581
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:02,730
What are you, the
  pope or something?

1582
01:30:04,532 --> 01:30:06,000
- Okay, I don't know what to do.

1583
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,502
Max, I don't know what to do.

1584
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:09,470
Nothing I say is
the right thing,

1585
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:11,239
and you're scaring me, okay.

1586
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:16,444
I mean, I already watched
 my whole family fall apart,

1587
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:19,247
and the truth is is that
I thought your family

1588
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:20,414
was the perfect family.

1589
01:30:24,418 --> 01:30:26,621
Now look,

1590
01:30:26,621 --> 01:30:30,792
both our families are nuts.

1591
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:31,926
(retching)

1592
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:33,161
God, it stinks in here.

1593
01:30:36,764 --> 01:30:37,598
- Sorry.

1594
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:39,834
- Um, this is all I could find.

1595
01:30:40,968 --> 01:30:42,170
- He's completely drunk.

1596
01:30:43,738 --> 01:30:46,073
- Okay, Max, let's
 take a little walk.

1597
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:53,114
(dial tone)

1598
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,783
(phone dialing)

1599
01:30:57,084 --> 01:30:59,220
(phone ringing)

1600
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:00,288
- [Anne] Hello.

1601
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:02,256
- Hi, Mom.

1602
01:31:02,256 --> 01:31:03,724
- [Anne] Jack?

1603
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:07,595
- Um, Max went a little
 crazy at dad's party today.

1604
01:31:07,595 --> 01:31:10,298
I mean, everything's fine,
 everything's under control.

1605
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:14,335
But I think Max and I are
  gonna stay here tonight.

1606
01:31:15,903 --> 01:31:16,838
- [Anne] Do you want
me to come and get you?

1607
01:31:16,838 --> 01:31:18,806
I can be there in two minutes.

1608
01:31:18,806 --> 01:31:20,842
You sure you're not
 being held hostage?

1609
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:22,276
- No, Mom, everything's okay,

1610
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:23,744
there's no hostage situation.

1611
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:26,647
- [Anne] Okay, bye.

1612
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:27,448
- Bye.

1613
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:32,453
- You know, Max is really
 lucky to have you as a friend.

1614
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:35,823
I spoke with Elaine.

1615
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:38,059
She said Steve is getting help,

1616
01:31:38,059 --> 01:31:39,660
and they're going to therapy.

1617
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:42,763
- Is he gonna move back in?

1618
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:45,967
- Uh, don't know, but it is
 never over until it is over.

1619
01:31:47,068 --> 01:31:47,902
- That's true.

1620
01:31:50,204 --> 01:31:51,038
Hey, Dad.

1621
01:31:51,038 --> 01:31:52,540
- Yeah.

1622
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:54,342
- Do you remember when we went
 to St. Michael's with Bob?

1623
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:55,610
- Mm-hmm.

1624
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:57,945
- Well, were you and
 him together then?

1625
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,815
- No, we were just friends then.

1626
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:04,852
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

1627
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:06,754
- We'll come back for that.

1628
01:32:07,788 --> 01:32:10,391
(upbeat music)

1629
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:13,494
- Okay, let's try it
 again, be careful.

1630
01:32:13,494 --> 01:32:16,464
- You know, we don't have
  to do this in the rain.

1631
01:32:16,464 --> 01:32:18,799
I can wait and get my
 license when I'm 30.

1632
01:32:18,799 --> 01:32:20,101
It's no problem.

1633
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:22,570
- Okay great, come on,
let's go, cut the wheel.

1634
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:26,107
Come on.

1635
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:27,241
Cut.

1636
01:32:27,241 --> 01:32:28,843
Cut a little more.

1637
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:30,244
Cut it more.

1638
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:31,445
Look, you're doing fine.

1639
01:32:33,781 --> 01:32:35,950
(banging)

1640
01:32:40,521 --> 01:32:42,189
- [Jack] What happened?

1641
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:43,891
- Did you do that on purpose?

1642
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:44,859
- No, are you okay?

1643
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:46,227
- Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1644
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:49,230
Why don't we call it
 a day today, okay?

1645
01:32:54,502 --> 01:32:57,204
- A car is not a
 car, it's a machine.

1646
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:05,179
- When you're ready,
 I'd like to take you

1647
01:33:05,179 --> 01:33:06,814
for your driver's test.

1648
01:33:06,814 --> 01:33:09,016
- It's okay, Michael
 said he would.

1649
01:33:09,016 --> 01:33:11,252
- I know, but I'd like
 to, if you don't mind.

1650
01:33:14,021 --> 01:33:14,855
- Yeah, sure.

1651
01:33:20,361 --> 01:33:21,596
- Are you gonna hate me forever?

1652
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:23,764
- I don't know.

1653
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:30,071
- Hard to believe.

1654
01:33:31,138 --> 01:33:32,506
You are turning 16.

1655
01:33:35,409 --> 01:33:37,278
- Yeah, it kinda
  creeps up on you.

1656
01:33:38,512 --> 01:33:39,347
- Yeah.

1657
01:33:41,082 --> 01:33:42,917
Maybe we should do
  something special.

1658
01:33:44,318 --> 01:33:45,987
Do you remember when
 we went to the circus?

1659
01:33:45,987 --> 01:33:47,755
- Yeah, I was six.

1660
01:33:47,755 --> 01:33:50,124
You took 10 of my friends,
  we had front-row seats,

1661
01:33:50,124 --> 01:33:52,660
and then the lion bit
the head off the monkey,

1662
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:54,829
and we all had nightmares
  for about a week.

1663
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:01,969
Well, Mom's baking a cake.

1664
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:06,040
I think that should
 be good enough.

1665
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:07,441
- Okay.

1666
01:34:07,441 --> 01:34:10,044
(car starting)

1667
01:34:19,053 --> 01:34:20,621
- [Jack Voiceover] When
 you're a kid, everyone makes

1668
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:22,456
a big deal outta your birthday.

1669
01:34:22,456 --> 01:34:26,027
You get presents, your mom
brings cupcakes to your school.

1670
01:34:26,027 --> 01:34:27,495
It's like a national holiday.

1671
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:33,868
The fact is, when you're
  16, you're not 15 anymore.

1672
01:34:33,868 --> 01:34:37,271
You wake up, you look at
 yourself, and there you are.

1673
01:34:37,271 --> 01:34:41,275
Your hopes, dreams and
fantasies starting right at you.

1674
01:34:41,275 --> 01:34:44,311
At a certain point, you stop
waiting for your life to begin.

1675
01:34:44,311 --> 01:34:47,581
You realize this is your
 life, right here, right now.

1676
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:51,218
Make of it what you
 will, what you can.

1677
01:34:59,827 --> 01:35:00,628
- [Max] Hey.

1678
01:35:02,063 --> 01:35:04,165
- So what, when I graduate
  is somebody gonna write

1679
01:35:04,165 --> 01:35:07,334
fag baby grows up in big
 letters on the school roof?

1680
01:35:08,202 --> 01:35:09,036
- Maybe?

1681
01:35:10,704 --> 01:35:11,705
Happy birthday.

1682
01:35:11,705 --> 01:35:12,673
- Thanks.

1683
01:35:12,673 --> 01:35:14,875
What is it, a pipe bomb, a gun?

1684
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:15,709
- No.

1685
01:35:16,577 --> 01:35:20,448
- Okay.

1686
01:35:20,448 --> 01:35:21,315
Condoms?

1687
01:35:22,483 --> 01:35:24,452
You got me condoms
  for my birthday?

1688
01:35:24,452 --> 01:35:25,519
- [Max] Yeah.

1689
01:35:26,687 --> 01:35:27,922
- Okay, well thanks
 for thinking of me

1690
01:35:27,922 --> 01:35:30,191
in such a weirdly personal way.

1691
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:31,826
I'll treasure them.

1692
01:35:31,826 --> 01:35:33,127
And then I'll use
 them when I'm like 50

1693
01:35:33,127 --> 01:35:35,129
and married or something.

1694
01:35:35,129 --> 01:35:38,299
(school bell ringing)

1695
01:35:42,636 --> 01:35:45,439
- [Teacher] So, your
  papers are due next week.

1696
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:48,442
And all papers are
 due, no exceptions.

1697
01:35:49,877 --> 01:35:51,612
- [Jack Voiceover]
 The thing about people

1698
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:53,280
is that they're human.

1699
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:57,151
As obvious as that is,
we have to remember it.

1700
01:35:57,151 --> 01:35:58,519
People are who they are.

1701
01:35:59,887 --> 01:36:03,023
And once you realize that,
you'll end up less disappointed.

1702
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:06,627
And then sometimes
 they'll surprise you.

1703
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:09,663
- Jack, Jack?

1704
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:12,900
Are you with us?

1705
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:13,734
- Not really.

1706
01:36:25,146 --> 01:36:27,448
- So, uh, see your cake?

1707
01:36:28,315 --> 01:36:31,519
- Yeah, it's fantastic.

1708
01:36:31,519 --> 01:36:34,221
- I got these guys, but, uh,

1709
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:37,491
I thought I better
  ask you first.

1710
01:36:38,959 --> 01:36:41,629
- Do we actually have
to put them on the cake?

1711
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:44,131
I just think I'm a little
  too old for decorations.

1712
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:46,700
- I think you're right.

1713
01:36:57,178 --> 01:36:58,145
- What is that?

1714
01:36:58,145 --> 01:36:59,813
- It's a Zendo.

1715
01:36:59,813 --> 01:37:00,614
- A Zendo.

1716
01:37:00,614 --> 01:37:02,316
- Yeah, a long story.

1717
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:03,150
- It's a Zendo.

1718
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:06,320
So, this is where
  I had my garden.

1719
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:10,658
And this is where I
used to play with Jack.

1720
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:14,261
- It's not a historical
 landmark, we still live here.

1721
01:37:14,261 --> 01:37:16,197
- I know, I know, I'm
just showing Bob around.

1722
01:37:16,197 --> 01:37:17,031
- Okay.

1723
01:37:18,132 --> 01:37:19,500
- Is Mom feeding the holly?

1724
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:21,869
- [Jack] I don't know.

1725
01:37:21,869 --> 01:37:22,703
- Anne.

1726
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:24,805
- [Anne] What?

1727
01:37:24,805 --> 01:37:26,040
- [Paul] Are you
  feeding the holly?

1728
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,308
- Am I feeding the hungry?

1729
01:37:27,308 --> 01:37:28,475
- The holly.

1730
01:37:28,475 --> 01:37:29,743
- The holly, uh, yeah,

1731
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:31,912
go ahead and do what you want.

1732
01:37:31,912 --> 01:37:33,514
Feed the holly,
 clip the forsythia,

1733
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,115
deadhead the roses, be my guest.

1734
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:38,352
- She's not feeding the holly.

1735
01:37:44,024 --> 01:37:46,694
(doors closing)

1736
01:37:57,271 --> 01:37:58,973
- Oh, who wants sprouts?

1737
01:37:58,973 --> 01:38:01,875
- Yes, please.

1738
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:03,477
- Hi, Jack, sorry I'm late.

1739
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:04,311
- Hi, Maggie.

1740
01:38:07,181 --> 01:38:08,449
- [Jack Voiceover]
 That Maggie did that,

1741
01:38:08,449 --> 01:38:10,818
in front of everyone,
 was rather impressive.

1742
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:16,190
I was also hoping Mrs. Burka
 was just a teeny bit jealous.

1743
01:38:28,068 --> 01:38:29,770
- [Paul] Mom and I worked
  together on that one.

1744
01:38:32,106 --> 01:38:32,940
- Thank you.

1745
01:38:44,151 --> 01:38:45,819
- Oh, it's beautiful.

1746
01:38:45,819 --> 01:38:46,687
Did you make that?

1747
01:38:46,687 --> 01:38:47,521
- I did.

1748
01:38:47,521 --> 01:38:48,689
- I bet you did.

1749
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:49,890
- Thank you.

1750
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:51,525
- [Elaine] Oh you're
welcome, I hope it fits.

1751
01:38:51,525 --> 01:38:52,693
- I have one, it'll fit.

1752
01:38:52,693 --> 01:38:55,562
(laughing)

1753
01:38:55,562 --> 01:38:56,764
- [Elaine] There we go.

1754
01:38:56,764 --> 01:38:58,732
- Here, open mine next.

1755
01:38:58,732 --> 01:39:01,101
(soft music)

1756
01:39:03,137 --> 01:39:04,104
That's my favorite.

1757
01:39:06,974 --> 01:39:08,509
- See?

1758
01:39:08,509 --> 01:39:09,343
Now I Know.

1759
01:39:14,214 --> 01:39:15,049
Thank you.

1760
01:39:15,049 --> 01:39:16,684
- You're welcome.

1761
01:39:16,684 --> 01:39:18,419
- [Jack Voiceover] I
  wanted to thank everyone,

1762
01:39:18,419 --> 01:39:20,087
but really I didn't.

1763
01:39:20,087 --> 01:39:23,457
Because thank you is
 such an overused word.

1764
01:39:23,457 --> 01:39:26,160
It means too many things,
  and at the same time,

1765
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:28,028
it means nothing.

1766
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:31,131
But one thing I did know

1767
01:39:31,131 --> 01:39:33,634
was that I wanted to
sit there until I became

1768
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:36,337
old enough to
 understand my life.

1769
01:39:36,337 --> 01:39:38,739
(soft music)

1770
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:42,876
- Well, I think
 that went very well.

1771
01:39:42,876 --> 01:39:45,679
- Yes, well, nothing fell on
 any one and no one choked,

1772
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:47,815
so they all seemed
 to have a good time.

1773
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:51,051
- My baby's 16 years old.

1774
01:39:51,051 --> 01:39:53,020
16, that makes me an old woman.

1775
01:39:54,254 --> 01:39:55,956
- Can I go for a walk?

1776
01:39:55,956 --> 01:39:57,057
- Go, go, go.

1777
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,194
Watch the leg.

1778
01:40:02,129 --> 01:40:02,996
- Who says you're old?

1779
01:40:02,996 --> 01:40:04,431
- I do.

1780
01:40:04,431 --> 01:40:05,232
So are you.

1781
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:14,608
- [Jack Voiceover] I walked
 through the night alone,

1782
01:40:14,608 --> 01:40:15,509
Jack singular.

1783
01:40:16,944 --> 01:40:20,381
I'd always be my mother's
 Jack, and my father's Jack,

1784
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:22,282
and the Jack with
 the gay dad and Bob,

1785
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:25,686
and Michael and Max and Mrs. B.

1786
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:29,056
I'd always be all that, but
 more than that, I was myself.

1787
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:32,159
Jack, no strings attached.

1788
01:40:33,427 --> 01:40:35,529
Whatever my family was or wasn't

1789
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:37,331
seemed to be getting
 less important.

1790
01:40:38,766 --> 01:40:40,934
My life was my own now,
  and my job was to make it

1791
01:40:40,934 --> 01:40:42,236
what I wanted it to be.

1792
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:46,039
I only wished I'd known
 that a couple of years ago.

1793
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:51,478
I was Jack, plain Jack, Jack
 out there all by myself.

1794
01:40:59,286 --> 01:41:01,989
(dramatic music)

1795
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:07,828
Jack takes the pass,
 the announcer's voice

1796
01:41:07,828 --> 01:41:09,430
boomed in my head.

1797
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:11,565
I ran unevenly across the court,

1798
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:14,168
wondering if my leg would
  ever be normal again.

1799
01:41:14,168 --> 01:41:17,037
Or if my life would
 ever be normal again.

1800
01:41:17,037 --> 01:41:18,705
Fast Jack is coming in low.

1801
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,109
I crouched down,
 dancing in and out.

1802
01:41:22,109 --> 01:41:24,378
My leg felt like I was
 stepping on pushpins.

1803
01:41:25,813 --> 01:41:28,549
(dramatic music)

1804
01:41:40,527 --> 01:41:43,564
He's up, Fast Jack is up.

1805
01:41:43,564 --> 01:41:44,865
I pushed through the pain.

1806
01:41:46,066 --> 01:41:48,635
As the crowd roared,
 my leg didn't hurt.

1807
01:41:48,635 --> 01:41:51,105
Nothing hurt, my
  mind was flowing.

1808
01:41:52,306 --> 01:41:54,475
I was Fast Jack, and
 I knew I would make it

1809
01:41:54,475 --> 01:41:57,311
and that everything
 would be okay.

1810
01:42:02,316 --> 01:42:04,918
(upbeat music)
