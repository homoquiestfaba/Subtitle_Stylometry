1
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,900
<i>There was a time...</i>

2
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,200
<i>when the fierce and beautiful land of
Alagaesia ...</i>

3
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,300
<i>was ruled by men has stride mighty dragons.</i>

4
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,900
<i>To protect and serve
was their mission.</i>

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,400
<i>And for thousands of years
the people prospered.</i>

6
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,900
<i>But the riders grew arrogance.</i>

7
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,900
<i>And began to fight among
themselves for power.</i>

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,500
<i>Sensing their weekness, a young rider
named Galbatorix, betrayed them.</i>

9
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,000
<i>And in a single, bloody battle...</i>

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
<i>believed he had killed them all.</i>

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,200
<i>Riders and dragons alike.</i>

12
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,500
<i>Since then, our land has been
ruled by Galbatorix.</i>

13
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,100
<i>He crushed all rebellion...</i>

14
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,100
<i>including the freedom fighters
known... as The Varden.</i>

15
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,000
<i>Those that survived
fled to the mountains.</i>

16
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,200
<i>There, they hoped for a miracle,
that might even their odds against the king.</i>

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,300
<i>Our story begins one night...</i>

18
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,500
<i>as Arya, an ally of the Varden...</i>

19
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,200
<i>rides for her life.
Carrying a stone...</i>

20
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,200
<i>stolen from the king himself.</i>

21
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,900
I suffer without my stone.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,300
Do not prolong my suffering.

23
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,100
<i>Miles away, a young boy
ventures out hunting.</i>

24
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,100
<i>His life and Alagaesia...</i>

25
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,100
<i>will never be the same again.</i>

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,900
You've lost!

27
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,400
Give it to me!
- Durza.

28
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,900
And I let you live.

29
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Is there anyone who trusts
the word of a shade?

30
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,200
Where did you send it?

31
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,800
Poor Durza...

32
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,700
How will you tell the king...

33
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,400
you failed.

34
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,200
Two more patriotic volunteers
for the king's army.

35
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,800
My sons are not fighters.

36
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,500
The men you take they never return.

37
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,300
Every village must do its share.

38
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,200
Rejoice...

39
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,700
your sons will be heroes.

40
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,300
Expensive taste Eragon?

41
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,300
The king's trip.
Best cut there is.

42
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,300
The fat just...melts into the meat.

43
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
How much?

44
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,900
How much?!

45
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,600
Too much for a poor farmboy.

46
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,800
I have something.

47
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,500
Something to trade.

48
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
What is this?

49
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,000
Some kind of stone?

50
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,900
I've found it.
- Stoled it more likely.

51
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,000
I was hunting...

52
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,200
hunting in the spine.

53
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,600
Put it back.
It belongs to the king.

54
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,200
Tell no one you have it.
You've endangered the whole village.

55
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,200
Now get out!

56
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,500
I don't need that sort of trouble here.

57
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,600
Get...Get out!

58
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,700
Look at this!

59
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,300
A necklace.

60
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Now where the two like you find
such an appetizing string of jewels?

61
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Interesting you should ask.
- Is that right?

62
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,900
I was walking up the land the other day,
admiring them sitting on a branch.

63
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,100
Clap a thunder,
they fell off, there at my feet.

64
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,100
So I thought:
well, can't leave 'em there.

65
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,700
Someone might trip.

66
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,300
So I hang them up there all the way.

67
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,900
You know what I think?
- What's that?

68
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,500
I think you're a thief...

69
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,600
A poacher.
- Oh, no.

70
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,200
I confiscate them all, in the name of the king.

71
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,600
Don't try...

72
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,800
Well, I just cut down for you then, shall I?

73
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,600
Got those.

74
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,300
Sorry I didn't pluck 'em.

75
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,500
Take care with the little bones.

76
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,200
Hate to see you choke.

77
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,300
Oh, hell, Eragon,
the mighty hunter returns.

78
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,600
Oh, yeah...

79
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,100
...with his invisible catch.

80
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,900
What happened?
Did you get scared when the deer grout?

81
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,800
No respect for the hunter?

82
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,700
- Whoa...

83
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Don't you ever learn ?

84
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,500
Shall we have another lesson today?

85
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,100
Fight like an old goat boar...

86
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,200
Hey, my breakfast!

87
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,800
You too slow, Roran.
- Wake up dreamer!

88
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,800
That sounded like your head...

89
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,100
Hey, come on boys,
that's enough!

90
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Come on, Roran.

91
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Eragon...

92
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm leaving.

93
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,300
I'm old enough to be recruited now.

94
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,600
Before the soldiers come looking for me.

95
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
I won't serve in the army.

96
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,300
I'll send word when I've settled.

97
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,200
But...what...
- He knows.

98
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,300
I already told him.

99
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,400
Where will you go?

100
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,200
Don't know yet.

101
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,300
All I know is I'm going.

102
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,300
Roran...!
Eragon...!

103
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,900
Come on.

104
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,400
Roran told you then?

105
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,800
Your day will come too, Eragon.

106
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,700
And you will decide for yourself
the kind of life you wish to lead.

107
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,300
Uncle, I like my life...

108
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,400
right here.

109
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,400
What many men seek is often
right under their nose.

110
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,000
But for some...
the unknown is too hard to resist.

111
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,200
Is that why my mother left?

112
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,200
My sister was in a great
hurry when she left you here.

113
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Whatever her reasons, we can only trust,
they were for your own good.

114
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,700
Besides...had she not...

115
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,200
I wouldn't have gained another son.

116
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,600
Take these.

117
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,200
I've been saving them for you.

118
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,900
Your blessing is all I need.

119
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,700
Take care of yourself, Roran.

120
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,300
Goodbye, Father.

121
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,600
Be strong...

122
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Brother.

123
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,700
And welcome that aim.

124
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,200
You may make a hunter yet.

125
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,300
Not a stone...

126
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
An egg!

127
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Look at you...!

128
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
What are you?

129
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,900
Well...you're not a bird.

130
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,700
Where is it?

131
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,000
Too late...

132
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,800
it's hatched.

133
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,300
<i>...It's hatched...</i>

134
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,600
Look at what you did!

135
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,700
<i>Eragon, wake up!</i>

136
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,500
<i>Get on with your toast!</i>

137
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,900
Hungry?

138
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,100
Go on...

139
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,300
Drink while it's still warm.

140
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,600
Sorry...
That's all there is.

141
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,900
So much for our rat problem...

142
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,400
My king, Galbatorix.

143
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,500
As you feared, the dragon has hatched.

144
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,000
But to a mere farmboy.

145
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,100
To whom, is not the issue.

146
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,600
When The Varden learned that the legend is real
they will be encouraged to challenge me.

147
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,200
And I am not interested
in being challenged.

148
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,300
There is no one left,
for you to fear, my king.

149
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Beyond these borders,
are remnants of the resistant.

150
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,800
Dwarves, Elves, The Varden.

151
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,500
I can't let them have hope.

152
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,300
Do not let them reach The Varden.

153
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
I will find the boy.

154
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,200
And kill him,
before he becomes a man.

155
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,900
Where is your mother?

156
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,700
Did she abandon you, too?

157
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Did she leave in a great hurry?

158
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,100
Rasack!

159
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,800
Rasack!

160
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,400
Rasack!

161
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,300
Kill the rider!

162
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,300
Nothing from my voice.

163
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,600
Not a word.

164
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,900
Their mother's heart be broken.

165
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,600
And for what?

166
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,400
More death?
More suffering?

167
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,100
Easy Horst!
The soldiers will hear you.

168
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,200
What's that matter?

169
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,900
Speak, or not speak...
It makes no difference.

170
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,800
Quite Brom.

171
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
A fool like you has nothing to loose.

172
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,200
No argument there...

173
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,600
Don't mind me.

174
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,100
But it wasn't always like this,
was it?

175
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,900
There was a time when our land
flourished without cruelty and fear.

176
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,900
The time of dragons
and dragonriders.

177
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,900
Those days are long gone.

178
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,600
*They only live in Brom's stories...*

179
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,700
*You know exactly what I'm talking about*

180
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,400
*Men stride magnificent beasts...*

181
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,200
No one could defeat them.

182
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,800
Until...there was one of their own...

183
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,200
A rider named, Galbatorix.

184
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,100
Decided to take all
the power for himself...

185
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,100
and cut down any dragonrider opposed him.

186
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,800
Enough!!!
Before you're hung by a tree.

187
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,800
No!

188
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,900
Let him finish!

189
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,800
And one day he will pay for his crime.

190
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,500
Are you deaf!
Be on your way!

191
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,700
The time of dragonriders...

192
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,200
will come again.

193
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
<i>And then Brom said:</i>

194
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,200
<i>"The time of the dragonriders will come again!"</i>

195
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
First...

196
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,200
I think you need to fly.

197
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,700
You did it!

198
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,100
She's gone.

199
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,200
<i>What's happening?</i>

200
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
<i>Brom was right, Eragon.</i>

201
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,900
<i>The time of the dragonriders
has come again.</i>

202
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,700
You can hear my thoughts?

203
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,800
<i>I have waited a thousand years
to hear your thoughts.</i>

204
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,500
<i>And now you can hear mine.</i>

205
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,900
<i>I am Saphira.</i>

206
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,700
<i>And you...</i>

207
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,200
<i>...are my rider.</i>

208
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,300
- Rider?

209
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,200
- Get out!

210
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,400
Is it true?

211
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,900
What you've spoke of?

212
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,000
-Didn't you hear me?

213
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,000
- Get out!

214
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,200
- I want to know more.

215
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,900
Please...

216
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,400
tell me about the dragons.

217
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,000
Did anybody follow you here?

218
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,600
How big will they grow?

219
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,000
When do they breath fire?

220
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,700
Sssshhhh....

221
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,000
Keep your voice down!

222
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,100
You mocked the king...

223
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,700
in front
of the soldiers.

224
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,900
I always say...

225
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,500
better ask forgiveness, than permission.

226
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,300
Then tell me!

227
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,900
Tell me about the dragons.
- Go home!

228
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,800
Mind your corn,
tend your fields, right?

229
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,500
You just get yourself into trouble.

230
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,800
Was it made you then?
A liar or a coward?

231
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,500
I know...
I know your story is true.

232
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,500
I told you...
his name is Eragon.

233
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,700
The boy...
the boy...took it with him.

234
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,200
He lives on a farm...
the furthest one in the back.

235
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,700
Eragon!
It's you they want!

236
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,600
Take me down.
- You're in danger.

237
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,900
What are you doing?
I have to warn my uncle.

238
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,300
What are you doing?
I have to warn my uncle.

239
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,700
It's too late, there's
nothing you can do.

240
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,000
Hold on!

241
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,900
You're ridiculous!
Hold on!

242
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,700
I'm begging you please put me down now.
- I can't! They'll kill you!

243
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,200
Put me down now!

244
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,200
- You stupid boy!

245
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,100
I'm slipping!

246
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,800
Put me down now!

247
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,700
You're giving me
no choice.

248
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,900
Uncle?
Uncle!

249
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,900
Eragon?

250
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,100
I should've been here...

251
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,600
to warn him.

252
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,800
It is your fault!
- But you would've met the same fate.

253
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,000
No!
I could have saved him.

254
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,600
Go away!

255
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,900
And stay away!

256
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Uncle, I'm sorry.

257
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,800
No!

258
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,400
You?
- Let go of me.

259
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,000
Where is your dragon?
- Gone.

260
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,700
What do you mean gone?
- I sent her away.

261
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,200
Are you gonna stay here? I know they'll be back for you.

262
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm not going anywhere...
not until I bury him.

263
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,800
There...

264
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,500
- What are you doing?

265
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,800
Funeral, fit for a king.

266
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,800
Let go.

267
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,100
Listen! They've killed him,
but they were after you.

268
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,900
If we stay here, we're both death.

269
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,500
Now, get on that horse.
Go on!

270
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,900
Get up there!

271
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,900
Who are you?
- Ride, now, go on!

272
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,000
Come on boy, ride!

273
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Why here?

274
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,700
- Because I said, here.

275
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,400
Call your dragon.
- My uncle was killed because of her.

276
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,600
She was protecting you
against the Razak.

277
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,200
I could've killed them.
- That's the spirit.

278
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,400
One part brave, three part fool.

279
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,900
What?
You don't think I could do it?

280
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,600
A Razak kill mercylessly.
That's what they do.

281
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,900
But a boy of fifteen...sixteen...

282
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,800
Seventeen!

283
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,100
Seventeen. Forgive me!

284
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,800
Well I think even a seventeen-year-old boy...

285
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,300
might probably last a minute,
against Durza's assasins.

286
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,500
Then I'll find Durza, and kill him.

287
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,300
Durza is a shade.

288
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,700
A sourcerer.

289
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,100
Possessed with demonic spirits.

290
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,100
Find Durza...huh...

291
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,600
You'll be no better off than your uncle.

292
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,500
You  just pray to heaven he doesn't find you.

293
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,600
Cause the king won't rest,
until he does.

294
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,700
You are The Varden's only hope.

295
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,800
Who are The Varden?
- Rebels, outcasts...

296
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,700
Men who are brave or...
mad enough to oppose Galbatorix.

297
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,500
They were the stronghold
in the Boar mountains.

298
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,600
How do you know all this?

299
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,600
Because I've been a part of it.

300
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,500
I've seen things...

301
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,400
You could never imagine.

302
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,100
Now, call your dragon.

303
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,900
She is far away by now...
She can't hear me.

304
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,600
Shall we have an aggreement,
not to lie to each other.

305
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,000
I know she hears your thoughts.
Now, call your dragon.

306
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,400
<i>- Saphira, can you find us?</i>

307
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,200
<i>- I never left you.</i>

308
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,100
<i>- I'm so sorry for what I've said.
- I understand.</i>

309
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,400
<i>- You loved him very much.</i>

310
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,200
<i>And who might this be?</i>

311
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,300
<i>- This is Brom.</i>

312
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,200
<i>- He knows about dragon.
- He...knows about dragons...</i>

313
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,500
<i>- I'll be a judge of that.</i>

314
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,700
<i>- Easy...I think he is a friend.</i>

315
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,700
Muscular...

316
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,000
graceful proportions.

317
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,900
Talons...

318
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,100
Nice big curve...

319
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,800
Legs are bit thin...

320
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,100
<i>- Only my voice is gentle,
old man.</i>

321
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,700
Spikes...
sharp...

322
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,900
All in all...

323
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,700
a fine young dragon.

324
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,900
<i>- Well...he does know...
a bit about dragons.</i>

325
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,400
And soon...

326
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,300
strong enough to ride.

327
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,500
Not me. I won't do it again.

328
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,200
My story was about you, Eragon.

329
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,700
It is your fate to be a dragonrider.

330
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,900
The Varden need a rider...

331
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,500
If they're to defeat Durza and the king.

332
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,400
I didn't ask for any of this.
- But you were chosen, nevertheless.

333
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,600
A dragon will only hatch,
if it feels the presence of its rider.

334
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,300
It'll wait forever if it has to.

335
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,700
<i>- What he says is true.</i>

336
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,100
And now it's found you,
it will serve you, and only you...

337
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,500
and that's why your life is in danger.

338
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,500
Because it chose me?

339
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,500
No.

340
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,700
Because the easiest way for the king
to destroy your dragon...

341
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,700
is to kill you.

342
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,800
A rider will live on
if its dragon is killed...

343
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,600
but if a rider dies...

344
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,600
<i> - so does his dragon.</i>

345
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,100
Handsome blade.

346
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,500
Simple...

347
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,100
until a point.

348
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,800
The farmboy evaded the Razak.

349
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,500
Bring me his hand.

350
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,300
Durza will send his urgalls after us.

351
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,000
I had five hard days ride
as the river down at Daret.

352
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,300
The last outpost before you reach the foothills.

353
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,600
Now if we can get there, without being discovered
we have a chance.

354
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,100
Tell Saphira, to fly above us and scout
the countryside for urgalls.

355
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,300
Or worst, Razaks...
If they find us we'll have no chance.

356
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,200
And tell her:
only to come to us at night.

357
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,000
Do as he says.

358
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,700
<i>But be careful.</i>

359
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,300
<i>You be careful.</i>

360
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,600
This way.

361
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Urgalls. They used to be the king's enemies.
Now they're his guard!

362
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,700
They were faster than I thought.
We gotta stay off the roads.

363
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,100
Why can't we take 'em?
- Quiet!

364
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,100
You're not ready to take anything yet.

365
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,300
I have skills.

366
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,900
I can fight.

367
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,300
My cousin...
Roran and I...

368
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,500
we've trained.

369
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,900
With swords.
- Well, then...

370
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,900
perhaps I underestimated you.

371
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,000
Right then..
and see these skills of yours.

372
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,000
You know, this won't be virtual then.

373
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500
*Humor me...*

374
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,500
Oh dear...

375
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,800
wanna see the effect of your training?

376
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,700
Good...Good...

377
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,900
Don't get...

378
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,800
...over confident.

379
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,300
It won't be your cousin Roran
you're fighting.

380
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,800
And it won't be wooden staves either.

381
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,000
<i>I could've beaten him,
but I didn't want to hurt the old man.</i>

382
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,500
<i>Of course you could've...
</i>

383
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,200
- Don't dragons breath fire?

384
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,000
She is not old enough to sustain flame.

385
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
<i>Lucky for you...</i>

386
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,100
Brizinge.

387
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,000
How did you do that?

388
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,200
What did you just do?

389
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,500
I...started the fire.

390
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,700
<i>He doesn't trust me.</i>

391
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,500
<i>Maybe we need to trust him first.</i>

392
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,700
Now get to sleep.

393
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,100
With any luck tomorrow,by the end of the day,
we would have slipped through Daret unseen.

394
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,300
Then it's the foothills of the Boar mountains
on a straight shot...

395
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,600
to The Varden.

396
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,300
Eragon, wake up, come on, wake up.

397
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,200
We are at the village of Daret.
We leave the horses here.

398
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,400
Keep Saphira close.

399
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,400
Rice and bread...down there.

400
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Come back meet me here,
it won't be long.

401
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,700
Don't talk to anybody.

402
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,100
Do you wish Angela to read your fortune?

403
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,800
But I have no money.
- Did Angela ask for money?

404
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,700
Knuckle bones of a dragon.

405
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,200
They would tell me everything about you.

406
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,700
This is difficult...

407
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,500
A young life so tangled...

408
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,500
but you have been long awaited by many races.

409
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,400
Great battles waved around you.

410
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,600
Can't be.
I don't understand.

411
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,900
You have powers you do not acknowledge.

412
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,700
But there is a doom upon you.

413
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,400
Part of it lies in death...that rapidly approaches.

414
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,700
No...
It's only happened.

415
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,100
And a girl...
she calls to you...in your dreams.

416
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,800
She is part of your past.

417
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,800
...and your future.

418
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,300
Who is she?

419
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,800
Tell me her name.

420
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,700
Do I have to do everything by myself?
- The fortuneteller...

421
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,900
Did she tell you about him?

422
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,100
Come on!

423
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,200
Where's everybody gone?

424
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,100
She told of our future.

425
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,400
The future is for the living, Eragon.

426
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,600
Come on!

427
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,700
Saphira.

428
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,800
Brizinge!

429
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,300
<i>Eragon!</i>

430
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,500
<i>Eragon...</i>

431
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,400
My hand...
burns.

432
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,000
Slowly, slowly, slowly ...

433
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,800
My head...

434
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,900
feels like I've been kicked by a horse.

435
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,100
What happened?

436
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:25,100
Most new dragonriders take years to learn
what you've discovered by instinct. .

437
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,300
What was that?
- Magic.

438
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,500
I was only reacting.

439
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,900
Magic...comes from dragons.

440
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,800
Flows through the riders who command.

441
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,800
Saphira.

442
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,800
- She is fine.

443
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,900
But she felt your fear,
as her own.

444
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,000
Your bound with her is strong.

445
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,300
Those were Urgers, weren't they?

446
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,500
- Yes.

447
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,500
Did I kill them?

448
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,000
- Yes.

449
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,000
But death is nothing to celebrate.

450
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,000
Magic...must be your last resort.

451
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,900
It has rules,
it has...limitations.

452
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,500
Before you cast a spell,
you must learn the ancient language of the Elves.

453
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,100
Brizinge?
- Brizinge...

454
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,100
Means fire..is fire.
The thing is the word.

455
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,600
Know the word,
and you controll the thing.

456
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,700
Before you can cast a spell...

457
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,600
you must have the physical strength
to stand its effect.

458
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,500
Some spells will leave you weakened.

459
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,300
Other spells...

460
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,300
as you found out on the bridge...

461
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,600
will leave you unconscious.

462
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,300
And yet other spells
if you use them before you are ready...

463
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,800
will kill you.

464
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,400
I can teach you the words...

465
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,400
but the limit of your strength...
you must learn yourself.

466
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,800
What's the word for "tree"?
- Tree is Traevan.

467
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,300
And a branch?
- Gevaister.

468
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,700
Gevaister.

469
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,700
And when a dragon and rider are truly one,
and they see as one...

470
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,900
And that's...

471
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,800
Skulvlaqueswenn.

472
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,900
Skulvlaqueswenn.

473
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,700
Well, since we've announced ourselves
so spectecularly to the world,

474
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,300
we're gonna have to find
another way through these hills.

475
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,100
Course...

476
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,800
that would be a lot easier...

477
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,200
if you were flying...

478
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,100
<i>Did someone mention flying?</i>

479
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,400
<i>Are you ready to try again?
Dragonrider?</i>

480
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,500
<i>I didn't do so well last time.</i>

481
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,300
<i>We didn't do so well.</i>

482
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,700
<i>You can thank Brom for the sadle.</i>

483
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,500
That's not so bad up here.

484
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,000
<i>Not so bad at all.</i>

485
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,900
Yeah!

486
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,000
<i>Lean!</i>

487
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,300
<i>Not that much!</i>

488
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,800
Feel how she moves, Eragon.
How she turns.

489
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,600
And when she accelerates.

490
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,000
- Come on, let's see what you've got.

491
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,200
<i>You want speed?
Here we go.</i>

492
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,300
<i>Hold on, Eragon.</i>

493
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:04,600
You asked for it.
- Let her go!

494
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,600
<i>When we truly one...</i>

495
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,700
<i>...you can fly from everywhere.</i>

496
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,400
<i>Even from the tail.</i>

497
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,000
- I wanna try it.

498
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,400
<i>Maybe not yet.</i>

499
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,200
Oh, it's easy, I can do it.

500
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,400
<i>Maybe not yet.</i>

501
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,200
<i>- Maybe not yet.</i>

502
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,200
Maybe I can try this.

503
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,200
Skulvlaqueswenn

504
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,200
Fantastic!

505
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,800
You always see like this?

506
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,500
- That's nothing...

507
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,000
watch this...

508
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,300
What's wrong?

509
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,200
Razacks!

510
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,500
Brom!

511
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,000
This time they die.
Now go!

512
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,500
With pleasure.

513
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,100
Come on, come on...
Eragon, stay out of this!

514
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Lower, Saphira, lower!

515
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:05,800
Gevaister!

516
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,600
<i>Eragon!
Above you!</i>

517
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,600
Protect your dragon.

518
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:01,100
Your irresponsibility could
cost Saphira her life.

519
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,300
<i>Don't worry about me.
I'm stronger than he thinks.</i>

520
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,400
You don't listen to anything I tell you?

521
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,400
Better to ask forgiveness
than permission.

522
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:23,600
Your duty is to reach The Varden alive.

523
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,500
Let's talk about truth, before we start
talking about duty.

524
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,500
What do you talking about?

525
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,400
I thought we agreed...

526
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,900
not...

527
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,100
to lie to one another.

528
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Dragonrider.

529
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,500
<i>Of course.</i>

530
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,300
Not anymore.

531
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,200
Where is your dragon?

532
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,600
Dead.

533
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,100
She was murdered by another rider.

534
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,600
With this sword.

535
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,500
Azarog.

536
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,700
<i>That sword is a dragonkiller.</i>

537
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,300
Rider's name...

538
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,100
was Morzan.

539
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,600
Galbatorix won him over.

540
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
And while she was trying to protect me...

541
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,600
my dragon was killed.

542
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,400
<i>Better we...</i>

543
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,800
<i>than our riders.</i>

544
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,900
So I...set out to search for Morzan.

545
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,800
And I found him.

546
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,200
I took his sword...

547
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,000
and I drove it through his heart.

548
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,500
And as he died, so did his dragon.

549
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,100
The last...

550
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,600
except for the king's.

551
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,400
So I hid out in Carvago.

552
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,000
With a shame...

553
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,100
I rightly deserved.

554
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,900
Because of me...

555
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,200
the days
of the dragonriders...

556
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,700
were over.

557
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,000
And you came...

558
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,300
you both... came.

559
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,600
<i>And now...</i>

560
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,500
<i>the days of the riders
have come again.</i>

561
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,500
Bring me the boy, I said.

562
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,100
Bring me his blood...

563
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,600
I said.

564
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,100
But you...

565
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,900
you bring me...

566
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,400
nothing!

567
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,900
You...

568
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,500
congratulations.
You've just been promoted.

569
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,000
I thought of this.

570
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,900
I'll bring the boy to me.

571
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,100
Tell me your name.

572
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,800
Eragon.

573
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,400
Eragon.

574
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,100
I am Arya, princess of Alaesmeria.

575
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,900
We are allies with the Varden.

576
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,000
You are the only one who can save me.

577
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,300
But how'll I find you?

578
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,700
- Durza holds me prisoner.

579
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,800
At Giliat.

580
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,800
Where're you going?

581
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,100
- To find Arya.

582
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,200
How do you know that name?
- She's Durza's prisoner.

583
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,600
I'm going to free her.

584
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,400
- That's out of the question.

585
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,300
Giliat is the opposite direction.

586
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,000
We can't start going back,
we're almost there.

587
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,200
I won't let you do that.

588
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,100
It's too much of a risk.

589
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:34,200
That egg was sent to me.
I'll decide what risk I'll take, not you.

590
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,800
Eragon, this is more than about "just us".

591
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,300
If I don't, she'll be killed.

592
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,400
Yes, and it's a sacrifice
she is happy to make.

593
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,500
Look, she values your life over hers.

594
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,900
I won't let her die.
- If she dies...

595
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:50,200
then she'll join the countless others,
who died waiting for you.

596
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,400
As The Varden now wait for you.

597
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
You must try to understand,
it's your life that's important.

598
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,300
I do understand.

599
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,300
- One false move...

600
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,200
one reckless decision...

601
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,700
and everything is lost.

602
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,400
<i>It's good to be brave...but...</i>

603
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,600
<i>sometimes it's better to be wise.</i>

604
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,000
Eragon, listen to me.

605
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,400
- Your shame is not mine.

606
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,900
You forgot what it
means to be a dragonrider.

607
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,600
I will save her.

608
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,800
-Eragon?
- Please don't, Saphira.

609
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,400
I'm the rider, and I say we go!

610
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,800
<i>You drew too much attention,
we'll have to wait for night...</i>

611
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,700
<i>and I'll go in alone.</i>

612
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,500
<i>Those walls hold death, Eragon.</i>

613
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,300
Not today.
Not for us.

614
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,600
I'm going to save her life.
I can do this.

615
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,300
<i>Our power is greatest when
we're together.</i>

616
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:08,300
We can't truly be together, until
I become as strong as you.

617
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:20,700
Skulvlaqueswenn.

618
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,700
Mahrmohr.

619
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,300
Eragon!

620
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,600
You shouldn't have come!

621
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,100
But in the woods...
- Leave me here.

622
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:52,300
Go...Now...
- It's far too late for that.

623
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,800
Forgive me if I stare.

624
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:02,700
I knew you were young,but even then
I expected someone a little more...

625
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,300
well, more.

626
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,100
Brizinger!

627
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,300
A young magician...

628
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,500
how quaint...

629
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,900
Do you already feel it draining your strength?

630
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:43,700
They say, as a dragonrider draws his last breath...

631
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:48,400
he can hear the dying screams of his dragon.

632
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,000
No!

633
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,800
You have to do much better than that.

634
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,400
Get out.
- No...not without you.

635
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,200
Come on, let's go!

636
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Take Azarog!

637
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,700
Saphira, can you carry three?
- Not for very long.

638
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,800
I suggest you leave quickly.

639
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,100
Come on, let's get out of here!

640
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,500
Higher! They're on the roof!
- I can't.

641
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,700
The weight is too much.

642
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,200
Eragon.

643
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,900
Durza...Durza...

644
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,000
Durza is dead.

645
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,400
- Did you pierce him through the heart?

646
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:59,100
You can only kill a shade,
if you pierce him through the heart.

647
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,900
We must get help.
- Where?

648
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,800
From the Varden.

649
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,600
- Yes...go to the Varden.

650
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,600
Take this.

651
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,700
Go...

652
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,200
without me...

653
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,700
No...

654
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,600
I need you.

655
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,400
- No, Eragon.

656
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:33,400
It's I, who've always needed you.

657
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,600
You gave me my life back again.

658
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,700
Take care of Saphira.

659
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,800
Without her...

660
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,800
you'll find life it's hardly worth living.

661
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,300
I won't let you die.

662
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,600
Not for my mistake.

663
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,700
Laise!

664
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,100
Hale!

665
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,100
You're not strong enough...

666
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,200
Yet.

667
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,900
That's the spirit.

668
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:35,300
One part brave...three parts fool.

669
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,500
Forgive me.

670
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,800
<i>Eragon.
Let him die with pride...</i>

671
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,400
<i>as a dragonrider.</i>

672
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:42,700
<i>I can't breath fire yet, but...</i>

673
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,300
<i>I can do this for Brom.</i>

674
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,900
<i>Now time, can not ravage him.</i>

675
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,400
Who'll remember him?

676
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,300
Many people will...

677
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:05,800
because of you.

678
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,400
<i>Eragon.</i>

679
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,000
<i>The shade has poisoned her.</i>

680
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:07,200
<i>Someone's coming.</i>

681
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:17,300
I need you to get you to The Varden.
How do I find them?

682
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,400
This one's been following us.
- Stand up.

683
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,400
All my life I've dreamed of dragons.

684
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,900
Who are you?
And why're you following us?

685
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,700
I'm Murtagh.
And you need me, dragonrider.

686
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,000
Thanks, but I'll be fine without you.
- You seek The Varden.

687
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,900
I know the mountains.
Every valley and stream.

688
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,700
She'll suffer if you go straight.

689
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,300
Why did you risk your life for us?

690
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,000
My family was slaughtered by
the king's men when I was a boy.

691
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,700
I heard rumours...

692
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,300
They said a rider had appeared.
- Eragon.

693
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,700
<i>We must go.</i>

694
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,200
If there were ever a time for retribution...

695
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,500
this was it.

696
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,600
If you could show me
the quickest way to The Varden...

697
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,300
To the Varden it is.

698
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,500
You'll learn to trust me, dragonrider.

699
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,100
I'm not the only one you need to convince.

700
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,100
We'll have to go by foot from here.

701
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,600
Saphira.

702
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,300
<i>Keep Arya safe until I call you.
- I will.</i>

703
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,100
But hurry, the Urgers are closing in.

704
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,100
Thanks...Again...

705
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,100
Don't mention...

706
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,300
Tell me your vision looks something like this.

707
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:58,400
Come on.

708
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,700
Your task was simple.

709
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,600
Bring the boy to me.

710
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,400
But there were...complications.
- Yes, so I've heard.

711
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:45,100
Complications do tend to happen...

712
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
but fortunately for you,
your incompetence may work in my favour.

713
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,400
The boy's led us directly to The Varden.

714
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:57,300
And so the job falls upon you, Durza...

715
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,400
to remind those...

716
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:04,900
who resist my rule,
that as long as I am king...

717
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:10,700
this loyalty will be punishable, by death.

718
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,700
Gather my army and follow them.

719
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,300
Leave no one alive!

720
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:32,000
Which one of you is the rider?
- I am! my name is Eragon.

721
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:36,600
I am Ajihad,
Leader of The Varden.

722
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,600
If you are the rider,
call your beast inside.

723
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,700
If it attacks, you'll die first.

724
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:47,500
<i>Saphira, bring Arya.
But be cautious.</i>

725
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,000
<i>Where is Arya?
- She is holding on.</i>

726
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:13,900
<i>Her heart beats faintly.</i>

727
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:26,200
She's been poisoned... by a shade.

728
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:29,400
Our healers will make her well.

729
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,500
Watch over Arya...

730
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:32,000
<i>but be careful.</i>

731
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:35,100
<i>You be careful.</i>

732
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:04,100
Urgers...are scouting the mountain as we speak.

733
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,300
Time is short...
I must know if you're with us?

734
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,400
We'll be greatly outnumbered.

735
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:16,000
We've come to join you.

736
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,400
Seize him!
- Leave him!

737
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:44,000
He's with me.
He saved my life.

738
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:47,500
He is the son of Morzan,
the traitor.

739
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,600
Is it true?

740
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,700
- A son doesn't choose his father.

741
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,800
This was the only thing he ever gave me.

742
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,700
I hated that man until the day he died.

743
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:07,000
Lock him up!

744
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,200
If he tries to escape, kill him.

745
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,600
Let go of me...

746
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,600
I have no time to take chances...

747
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:17,600
The Urger's presence here can only mean
that the king's men are not far behind.

748
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:22,700
These cowards will hide no more.

749
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,900
Tonight we destroy the resistance.

750
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,800
But the boy is mine.

751
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,500
Excuse me, I should've knocked.

752
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,500
It's fine.

753
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,400
My father asked me to bring you to him.

754
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,300
I'll be ready in just a moment.

755
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,600
Arya has responded well
to our healers work.

756
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,400
*Has strength deep.*
- When can I see her?

757
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,300
She's resting now.

758
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,300
Only she can answer that.

759
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,600
They're afraid of me.

760
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,700
Why wouldn't they be?

761
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,000
There is no retreats from here, nowhere else to hide..

762
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
The suspicion has kept us alive all these years.

763
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,800
When words spread of a new dragonrider...

764
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:58,600
we were expecting someone who was more....

765
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:00,500
well...

766
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,200
- More than me...

767
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,200
I've heard it before.

768
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,700
Your armor is ready for you.

769
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:18,600
We must prepare for battle.

770
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,100
It's not as easy...

771
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,300
as it looks. Is it?

772
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,200
You look...

773
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:49,900
fit for battle!

774
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,200
Be strong, Eragon.

775
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,400
The search for a rider has been long and dangerous.

776
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,200
Some of us...

777
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:08,400
have carried the egg
for as long as we can remember hoping it would hatch.

778
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:12,500
And fate...
finally carried it to you.

779
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:16,200
Why me?
I'm just a farmboy from Calvo.

780
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:20,100
Because that...is who
Saphira chose.

781
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,800
I barely even recognize myself.

782
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,100
They worked through the night.

783
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,400
To protect our greatest hope.

784
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,500
And our leader, who rides her.

785
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,300
<i>It's time!</i>

786
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,400
Ready the archers!

787
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,300
I need to know, Saphira.
Why me?

788
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,900
<i>You choose a leader for his heart.</i>

789
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,100
But I'm not without fear.

790
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,300
<i>Without fear, there can not be courage.</i>

791
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,400
<i>But when we are together...</i>

792
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,400
<i>it is our enemies who should be afraid.</i>

793
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,100
And are we together, Saphira?

794
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,600
As one?

795
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,100
Take that as a "yes"!

796
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,500
Now!

797
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,800
Into the sky,
to win or die!

798
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:43,900
Fire!

799
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,900
Yeah!

800
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,400
Let me out!

801
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,500
Let me out!

802
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:00,700
Let me out of here!

803
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,100
No!

804
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,700
Time to return the favour!

805
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,800
Come!
Taste the blood of your dragon!

806
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,200
Let's finish this!

807
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:26,700
What is that thing?

808
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:28,600
- Dark magic.

809
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,300
Closer, so we can reach his heart.
- This time, rip it out of his chest.

810
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,200
Saphira.

811
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,600
Hear her scream!

812
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,100
Saphira, you're hurt!

813
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,000
- Don't worry about me.

814
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,500
You go mind in the fight.

815
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,100
Skulvlaqueswenn.

816
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:03,200
What's happening?

817
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,300
My vision's failing.

818
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,600
<i>It's not you...but me.</i>

819
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,800
<i>This wound weakens me.</i>

820
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:16,900
Easy, Saphira.

821
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,700
We gonna get through this...together.

822
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,300
<i>I'm loosing strength...</i>

823
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,200
I know what I have to do.

824
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:49,500
Now!

825
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,700
That's for Brom!

826
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,300
I expected more.

827
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,300
Saphira!

828
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:02,600
<i>We did it...</i>

829
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:03,500
Saphira...

830
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:09,300
<i>together.</i>

831
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,500
Whatever life...

832
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,800
there is in me...

833
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:17,500
take it!

834
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:21,100
- Eragon...no!

835
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:26,400
Even in you, don't have a heart...

836
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:29,100
strong enough...for

837
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,400
both of us.

838
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,200
Laise!

839
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,300
Hael!

840
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,000
Slowly, rider.

841
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,600
Saphira?

842
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,900
Some friends can't be replaced.

843
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,200
But luckily some don't have to be.

844
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,900
Saphira!

845
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:46,500
I didn't think I could do it.

846
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:48,000
<i>You shouldn't have...</i>

847
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:49,900
<i>it was reckless...</i>

848
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,400
<i>but I'm glad you did.</i>

849
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,300
Wasn't it an old, wise man who one said...

850
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:59,000
one part brave, three parts fool?

851
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:02,400
<i>Brom would be proud of you.</i>

852
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,700
<i>Of us.</i>

853
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,700
And Arya?
- Thought that might come up.

854
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,100
Get changed!

855
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,100
She is up to Alaesmeria.

856
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
<i>What horse was ever born
that could out run a dragon?</i>

857
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,400
You never gave me a chance to say goodbye.

858
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,600
There was no time.

859
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:13,100
Galbatorix will try to avenge this defeat.

860
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:16,000
I must return to my people in Alaesmeria.

861
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,500
And you must prepare The Varden.

862
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:26,000
You lost those who were dear to you.

863
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,900
You've payed a great price for your courage.

864
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:37,300
Did your people of The Varden already tell stories about you?

865
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,300
Legend of Eragon,
the great Shade Slayer...

866
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:42,700
is pressed throughout Alagaesia.

867
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,000
You know how legends go...

868
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,500
People believe just about anything these days.

869
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:53,800
When will I see you again?

870
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,400
Time goes quickly.

871
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,800
Only yesterday, you were a farmboy...

872
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,300
today you are a hero.

873
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:07,800
Tomorrow...

874
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:09,700
may see us together again.

875
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,900
Then I'll be waiting for tomorrow.

876
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:28,300
<i>Tomorrow will come...sooner than you think.</i>

877
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:37,800
Take care of him, Saphira.

878
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,600
<i>- I will.</i>

879
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,400
Come!
