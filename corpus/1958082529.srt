1
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,161
Ah...

2
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,634
Mmm.

3
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:07,014
I am legion.

4
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,518
I am Satan.

5
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,058
I am foulmouthed behemoth.

6
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,832
You doubt me?

7
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:39,113
You will find out
soon enough.

8
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,618
You mock me?!

9
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:06,674
I can possess anyone I choose.

10
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:08,676
Ah.

11
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,683
Anyone! Anything!

12
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:18,052
I do not believe you.

13
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:21,522
I don't believe you could even
possess this pig.

14
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:22,857
Can you do it?

15
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,659
You have the power.

16
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,493
Could you possess the pig?

17
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,196
Yes, I can.
Come on, Satan.

18
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,864
- Watch me!
- Possess the pig.

19
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,166
Show me you are
the Prince of Darkness.

20
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,369
Show to me your power!
Have you done it?

21
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,661
You can sleep now, my son.

22
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:02,563
The demon has gone.

23
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,005
God is with you.

24
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:40,968
♪ Oh, the heads that turn ♪

25
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:44,272
♪ Make my back burn ♪

26
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,342
♪ And those heads that turn ♪

27
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:52,445
♪ Make my back,
make my back burn ♪

28
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,562
Amy.
We're not in America anymore.

29
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:10,497
You can't dress like that.

30
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:11,832
Why?

31
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:12,934
Because there's going to be

32
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,936
construction workers
everywhere.

33
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:19,373
How you doing back there?

34
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:53,174
So, we left everything
for this?

35
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,109
Amy, please.
Don't start.

36
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,111
Yeah, 'cause you know
exactly what I'm gonna say.

37
00:07:57,244 --> 00:08:00,147
Yes, and I don't want
to hear it.

38
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:01,649
What do you think?

39
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,651
Pretty cool, huh?

40
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,722
Yeah, I know.

41
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,833
Cuckoo.

42
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,175
Gabriele.

43
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:39,186
That is a question
of theology.

44
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,323
No shit.

45
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,358
Perhaps it was his mercy

46
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:46,694
that stayed
Saint Michael's sword.

47
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:49,830
The only thing
that arrests God's love

48
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:52,867
is a person's freedom
to choose.

49
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,569
But God cannot be God

50
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,938
unless he allows
for this choice,

51
00:08:58,072 --> 00:09:00,074
even for the damned.

52
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,776
Saint Michael, he knows this.

53
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:05,746
We will all be judged.

54
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,217
We will all be judged
by how much we love.

55
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,385
Hmm.

56
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,988
Do not worry, Gabriele.

57
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,724
I will defend you.

58
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,092
Defend me?

59
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,427
Hmm.

60
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:25,534
My faith does not
require defense.

61
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,209
Wow.
What do you think, guys?

62
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,044
Cozy.

63
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:38,712
Oh, come on. Give it a chance.

64
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,481
This is awesome.

65
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,951
Carlos, hi!

66
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:45,753
So nice to put a face
to the voice.

67
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:48,255
Um, Padre...

68
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:49,890
Father Esquibel, uh...

69
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:51,725
Pleasure to meet you,
Ms. Vasquez.

70
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:52,893
Uh, Julia, please.

71
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,563
Carlos was giving me a tour.
Hmm.

72
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,831
Oh, great.
I just wanted to stop by

73
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,933
and welcome you and your family
to the diocese.

74
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,234
I'm-I'm sorry.
Oh, no, no, please.

75
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,936
Go for it.

76
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,904
I'm glad to see
you made it safe.

77
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:06,040
All right,
go find your room, twerp.

78
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,814
Hey, can I get one of those?

79
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,320
Thank you.

80
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,556
It's a wonderful
thing you're doing,

81
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:23,157
restoring the abbey.

82
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,726
We are being very respectful
of the existing architecture.

83
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,795
This, this has actually been
in my husband's family

84
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,498
for generations,
and we just inherited it.

85
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,601
Is Mr. Vasquez here or...

86
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:36,370
Oh, uh, he passed, actually,
about a year ago.

87
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:37,606
I'm sorry for your loss.

88
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:39,273
It's okay.

89
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:42,209
If you need anything, please,
hmm? Don't hesitate.

90
00:10:42,343 --> 00:10:43,711
Okay.

91
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,646
I will remember him
in my prayers.

92
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,448
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Thank you.

93
00:10:47,582 --> 00:10:48,849
It was nice to meet you.

94
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,619
Okay, Carlos, talk to me.

95
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,986
What's up?
Where are we at?

96
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,555
The basement excavation
is very complicated.

97
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,189
So, more expensive then,
you mean, right?

98
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,558
- I'm afraid so.
- All right.

99
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,192
I'll take another look
at the plans

100
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,894
if you can just show me
what the basement looks like.

101
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,662
Maybe I can wire some...
Amy!

102
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,198
Get off of there
before you break your neck.

103
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,534
Is that a cigarette?

104
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,201
Put that out right now, please.

105
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,202
Fine.

106
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,104
No! Oh, my God.

107
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,174
Cute.

108
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:49,843
Get out of my room.

Hey, have you seen
your brother?

117
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:26,307
Amy.

118
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:34,783
Look, I really can't handle
the silent treatment

119
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,116
from both my kids.

120
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:39,019
I know you don't want
to be here.

121
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:40,154
Yeah, no shit.

122
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:43,090
Amy... please.

123
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,659
I need your help.

124
00:13:44,793 --> 00:13:46,795
This abbey is the only thing
your dad left us.

125
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,395
We don't have an income
anymore.

126
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,366
Once we fix it up and sell it,
we'll go home. Okay?

127
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,537
Maybe if you could just
at least watch your brother.

128
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,237
Maybe try and get him
to talk.

129
00:13:57,371 --> 00:14:00,407
How? He hasn't spoken
in almost a year.

130
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,309
Can you try for me?

131
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,244
So, you want me to be
a mother for you?

132
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:07,214
Please just keep an eye
on your brother. Okay?

Father Amorth,
caffè latte?

138
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:53,961
Sugar?

139
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:11,546
This is
a formal hearing.

140
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,982
And as agreed, proceedings
will be undertaken in English.

141
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:20,789
On the night of June 4th
in the town of Tropea,

142
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,957
you performed an exorcism
without the approval

143
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,895
of the Reggio Calabria bishop.

144
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:30,264
In English, Father Amorth.

145
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:35,135
That was not an exorcism.

146
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,771
From Father Johnny's
description,

147
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:38,439
what occurred
in Reggio Calabria

148
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,775
sounded exactly like
an exorcism,

149
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:43,076
complete with animal sacrifice
no less.

150
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,278
The boy was maladjusted.

151
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:46,046
A temporary mental illness.

152
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,183
I use, uh,
primitive psychology.

153
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:51,285
The power of suggestion.

154
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,588
You addressed the subject
as Satan,

155
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:55,924
and called for him
to display his power.

156
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,357
Do you deny this?

157
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:58,959
No.

158
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,528
That's what I did.

159
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:01,629
And why would you do that?

160
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:03,798
Exorcism is my job,

161
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:07,034
but the vast majority of
the cases to which I'm assigned

162
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,370
do not require an exorcism.

163
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:13,942
They just need, uh,
a little conversation,

164
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:18,378
a little understanding,
and sometimes...

165
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:20,347
a little theater.

166
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:23,918
Cardinal Sullivan,
in my observation,

167
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:27,287
98% of the cases that
are assigned to Father Amorth

168
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:30,157
are then further recommended
by him

169
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,794
to doctors and psychiatrists.

170
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:34,796
And the other two percent?

171
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:37,532
Ah, the other two percent. Hmm.

172
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:40,668
This is something that has
confounded all of science

173
00:16:40,802 --> 00:16:43,505
and all of medicine
for a very long time.

174
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,442
I call it...

175
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:50,010
evil.

176
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:51,411
Your Eminence, with hundreds

177
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:53,146
of successful exorcisms,

178
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,148
Father Amorth has been
very effective in...

179
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,519
One moment,
Bishop Lumumba.

180
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:01,255
You do raise
an interesting point, Amorth.

181
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:04,926
You are not a doctor,
but these practices of yours

182
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,060
could have damaging effects
on these people.

183
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,229
You are right.

184
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,599
I am not a doctor.

185
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:15,003
I am not a psychologist.

186
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,572
But I am a theologian,
I am a lawyer,

187
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:20,875
I am a journalist,
and I am a practical man.

188
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,644
I was also a partisan
in the war,

189
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:25,580
so I know a firing squad
when I see one.

190
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,350
So, what is this about?

191
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:32,654
The Congregation
for the Doctrine of the Faith

192
00:17:32,787 --> 00:17:34,689
has recommended
to this panel

193
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:39,861
that the position of Chief
Exorcist be formally vacated.

194
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:42,730
So, what you are saying is
that evil does not exist?

195
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:44,231
The Church is under
constant pressure

196
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,733
to sharpen her relevance.

197
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:48,603
It's time we move past
these outdated beliefs.

198
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:51,438
Explain to me, please,
Your Eminence.

199
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:53,041
If evil does not exist,

200
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:57,077
what then is the role
of the Church?

201
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,582
I think we all
have to be careful

202
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:03,317
of the Congregation
for the Doctrine of the Faith.

203
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,186
Sounds to me like they want us
all out of a job.

204
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:10,592
Mm.

205
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,662
We have more questions for you,
Father Amorth.

206
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:20,568
How is it
that I am suddenly worthy

207
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:23,905
of the time and attention
of all you powerful men?

208
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:25,907
I ask you again,

209
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,809
what is this about?

210
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:29,376
Due process, Father.

211
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,647
So, this is not about
the dead girl, Rosaria Velendez,

212
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,583
that I write about
in "La Madre di Dio" magazine?

213
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:37,919
What is your due diligence
and process on this?

214
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:39,621
Please, Cardinal.
I warn you! I warn you!

215
00:18:39,754 --> 00:18:42,790
Father Amorth,
show respect to your superiors.

216
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:44,324
I do!

217
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,761
I am the Chief Exorcist
of the Vatican.

218
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:49,897
My position was appointed
by my bishop.

219
00:18:50,031 --> 00:18:51,566
My diocese is Rome.

220
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:53,635
My local bishop is the Pope.

221
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:57,805
If you have a problem with me,
you talk to my boss.

222
00:18:57,939 --> 00:18:59,206
Okay?

223
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,274
The Pope is infirm.

224
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:03,210
Father Amorth,
you have not been dismissed!

225
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:04,979
Cuckoo!
Father Amorth!

226
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,267
Hello?

227
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:03,037
Anyone there?

228
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:39,901
They hit a gas deposit.

229
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:42,136
We can't continue
working here.

230
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,139
I'm pulling my team
from this place.

231
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:49,177
Wait.

232
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:07,829
Henry?

233
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:09,831
Henry!

234
00:22:09,964 --> 00:22:10,865
Mom!

235
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,333
Oh, my God!

236
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:14,569
Henry!

237
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:16,070
What is happening?
I don't know.

238
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:17,238
He was like this
when I came in.

239
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,573
Henry?

240
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:19,574
Henry, it's Mommy.

241
00:22:19,707 --> 00:22:21,642
Talk to me.

242
00:22:21,776 --> 00:22:22,643
Henry.
Oh, my God.

243
00:22:22,777 --> 00:22:23,878
Mommy.

244
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,079
He's talking.

245
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:26,346
Hen-Henry.

246
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,316
Mommy.

247
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:35,723
You're all going to die.

248
00:22:35,857 --> 00:22:37,959
Henry! What are you doing?!

249
00:22:38,092 --> 00:22:39,694
Henry! Henry!

250
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:41,128
Henry!

251
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:53,574
X-rays, blood tests,
even the spinal tap

252
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,544
and MRI show no results
of ischemia or hematoma.

253
00:22:56,677 --> 00:22:58,478
What does that mean?

254
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:05,119
All of his, uh, vitals
and brain functions

255
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:06,654
seem to be normal.

256
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:09,023
Wait, normal? What do you mean?

257
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:10,224
He was convulsing.

258
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:15,096
Has he been through
any trauma recently?

259
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,433
Um...

260
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:22,370
yeah, uh, his dad died

261
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:24,372
about a year ago.

262
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,710
And how did he react?

263
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:32,713
Uh, he hasn't spoken since.

264
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:39,086
Wha... Psychosis?

265
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,421
No, that's not possible.
He's just a little boy.

266
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:45,059
Ma'am, uh, there is nothing
that we can do now.

267
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:47,561
But he can recommend
a good psychiatrist.

268
00:23:47,695 --> 00:23:48,562
What is this?

269
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:53,534
If your son continues
trying to hurt himself,

270
00:23:53,668 --> 00:23:55,636
you can administer him
this sedative.

271
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,704
No.

272
00:23:56,837 --> 00:23:58,105
Mom.
I'm so sorry.

273
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,774
Baby.

274
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:01,375
Oh, my God.

275
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:03,244
Oh.

276
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:10,751
No, I don't think
you understand.

277
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:13,254
But this is an emergency,
please.

278
00:24:13,387 --> 00:24:16,257
No, I, I need to talk
to someone

279
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,458
at the consulate
who can help me.

280
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:21,295
I need a-a specialist.

281
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:22,964
Okay.

282
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:25,132
Okay.

283
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:28,302
Yes, please.

284
00:24:48,456 --> 00:24:50,358
Baby.

285
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,959
Oh.

286
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:54,428
Hey.

287
00:24:55,463 --> 00:24:57,832
My love, come here.

288
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:18,986
Fuck this.

289
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:26,327
Henry, no.

290
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,562
Henry, stop!

291
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:29,663
Your baby's hungry,

292
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:30,898
you fat cow.

293
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:32,366
What? What are you saying?

294
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,435
You never breastfed me, Mommy.

295
00:25:34,568 --> 00:25:35,669
- What?
- What the fuck?

296
00:25:35,803 --> 00:25:37,872
Ow.

297
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:43,177
What the fuck
is that?

298
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,379
Bring me the priest.

299
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:49,683
Can you help us?
Yes.

300
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:51,485
I'm here to help, Julia.

301
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:52,887
Okay.

302
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:10,838
Wrong fucking priest!

303
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:56,310
There's a case
that needs your attention.

304
00:27:56,443 --> 00:27:58,379
A boy in Spain.

305
00:27:58,513 --> 00:28:03,951
Something about it
disturbs me greatly.

306
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,755
This boy's possession

307
00:28:07,888 --> 00:28:09,790
is progressing very fast.

308
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:14,228
The incident took place
in hallowed ground,

309
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:17,364
San Sebastian Abbey in Castile.

310
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:23,103
This place has given the Church
problems before.

311
00:28:24,573 --> 00:28:27,942
I sense a great evil
coming from there.

312
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:32,547
Something dark that only you
can help solve.

313
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,950
I have requested
the abbey's records

314
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,851
be brought to you
in the library.

315
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:41,088
Look into it.

316
00:28:41,222 --> 00:28:46,227
I will continue investigating
while you're on your journey.

317
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:53,367
"Our sins...

318
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,736
will seek us out."

319
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:59,840
Gabriele, go to Spain,

320
00:28:59,974 --> 00:29:02,376
and help this child.

321
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:06,681
But be careful,
this demon sounds dangerous.

322
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:05,139
Hello?

323
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:48,048
Ah.

324
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:50,752
Wait. Father Amorth?

325
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:52,687
Sì.
Ah.

326
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:54,855
I-I didn't expect them
to send you.

327
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:56,123
You know me?

328
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,491
Yes.

329
00:30:57,625 --> 00:31:00,361
I have read all the articles.

330
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:01,730
And the books?

331
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:03,497
No, no.
No, not the books.

332
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,700
The books are good.

333
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:07,301
I-I will read...
Okay.

334
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:09,370
I'll just get my bag.
You, uh...

335
00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:11,004
Whiskey?

336
00:31:11,138 --> 00:31:13,006
No, no, no, no. Thank you.

337
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,843
Yeah, this sore throat.

338
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:16,377
Uh, the... dust.

339
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:22,550
Julia, we have been
extremely lucky.

340
00:31:22,684 --> 00:31:23,785
The Church sent someone.

341
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:25,252
An expert in these matters.

342
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:26,554
Gabriele, please come in.

343
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:34,261
I have come from Roma.

344
00:31:37,264 --> 00:31:39,032
I'm sorry that you came
all this way,

345
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:42,369
but I don't even know why the
Church is interested in this.

346
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:44,371
I just want my son to be well.

347
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:46,206
Tell me something,

348
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,976
have the doctors given you
any answers?

349
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:50,812
Any comfort?

350
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:53,815
If you would at least...

351
00:31:53,947 --> 00:31:55,850
just let me see your son.

352
00:31:56,984 --> 00:31:58,586
I can give you my opinion,

353
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,789
and you can do with it
what you will.

354
00:32:05,693 --> 00:32:07,461
It's worth a shot.

355
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,566
Okay. He's upstairs.

356
00:32:17,705 --> 00:32:18,907
Hello, my friend.

357
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:38,959
Henry?

358
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:41,261
Are you awake?

359
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:49,329
Your prayers are worthless here.

360
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:24,866
Who are you?

361
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:27,602
Your worst fear.

362
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:29,604
I am your demise.

363
00:34:30,872 --> 00:34:32,740
Why are you possessing
this boy?

364
00:34:32,874 --> 00:34:38,211
'Cause it feels so good
to ruin such innocent flesh.

365
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:42,050
But I prefer the challenge
of an exorcist's soul.

366
00:34:42,182 --> 00:34:44,552
You only serve
to diminish yourself.

367
00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:46,955
Don't lecture me, priest.

368
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:48,590
What is your purpose?

369
00:34:48,723 --> 00:34:50,490
I'm here for you.

370
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:55,128
Then you must know my name.

371
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:59,499
I know your soul
and every shameless sin.

372
00:35:00,635 --> 00:35:03,037
Tell me one of my sins.

373
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:08,576
You cannot.

374
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,878
Because my sins
have been absolved

375
00:35:11,012 --> 00:35:13,581
by the one true master,
the Lord Jesus Christ.

376
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:15,984
Do not speak of him.
Are you afraid of him?

377
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:17,986
Are you afraid of Jesus Christ?

378
00:35:26,594 --> 00:35:28,596
Whatever you do,

379
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,065
you only do
because God allows it.

380
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:35,937
Did he allow that?

381
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,640
This is
just the beginning.

382
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:40,675
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

383
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:43,276
Then tell me.

384
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,612
Tell me your name.

385
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:46,681
Unless you are too afraid.

386
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:51,052
I'm not some stupid fuck
you convince to get into a pig.

387
00:35:51,184 --> 00:35:54,154
So you won't
tell me your name.

388
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:57,825
My name is blasphemy.

389
00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:01,896
My name is nightmare.

390
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:04,498
Huh.

391
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:10,370
My nightmare...

392
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:13,340
is France winning
the World Cup.

393
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:15,275
You prideful fool.

394
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:19,446
You can't hide behind
your jokes forever...

395
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,616
Gabriele.

396
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:25,053
I know your nightmares, too.

397
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:24,444
Beware, your sins
will seek you out.

398
00:37:27,648 --> 00:37:30,417
I'll be waiting for you,
Gabe.

399
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:36,289
Did you mention my name
to anyone in this house?

400
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:37,592
Maybe. I'm not sure.

401
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:39,660
This demon,

402
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:43,931
it says things
that it could not know.

403
00:37:44,065 --> 00:37:45,967
So it's, it's real?

404
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:49,170
What do you know
about demons?

405
00:37:50,705 --> 00:37:51,839
O-Only the basics,

406
00:37:51,973 --> 00:37:54,609
that they are fallen angels.

407
00:37:54,742 --> 00:37:56,577
One serves the other
in a hierarchy.

408
00:37:58,311 --> 00:38:02,850
The higher the demon,
the more access it can have.

409
00:38:02,984 --> 00:38:05,153
So why is it possessing
the boy?

410
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:06,621
This is a very good question.

411
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:08,256
I'm going to talk
to the mother.

412
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:11,458
I need to work out why
this demon has chosen Henry.

413
00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:13,561
What I am about to say

414
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:15,462
may be difficult.

415
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:18,232
Confronting.

416
00:38:18,365 --> 00:38:23,604
Your son is under the influence
of a very powerful demon.

417
00:38:23,738 --> 00:38:27,942
Removing the boy from this place
could be fatal.

418
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:33,781
I say to you now the only way
your son comes back to you

419
00:38:33,915 --> 00:38:35,616
is through faith.

420
00:38:36,818 --> 00:38:39,153
Mrs. Vasquez,

421
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:42,256
did anything happen
to Henry?

422
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:45,159
He was in the car accident
that killed his father.

423
00:38:46,828 --> 00:38:48,830
He saw his father impaled.

424
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,871
That memory, that's his demon.

425
00:38:57,004 --> 00:38:58,973
I give you my word,

426
00:38:59,106 --> 00:39:02,577
I will not walk away from you
or your son.

427
00:39:05,046 --> 00:39:08,481
Trauma, such as you describe,
can be a gateway for the devil.

428
00:39:10,218 --> 00:39:14,956
Suffering can make a soul
desperate for connection.

429
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:18,059
It can make the innocent
more vulnerable.

430
00:39:22,697 --> 00:39:25,733
You must have loved
your husband very much.

431
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:31,239
You have no idea.

432
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:35,676
He was your
soul connection, sì?

433
00:39:37,311 --> 00:39:39,213
He was everything.

434
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:44,252
And you have
two beautiful children.

435
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:51,926
A mother's love is the closest
thing we know to God's love.

436
00:39:55,096 --> 00:39:57,098
Tell me, Julia...

437
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,068
have you ever believed?

438
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:06,707
Uh, when I was a little girl,

439
00:40:06,841 --> 00:40:08,943
I used to think that
my guardian angel

440
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:10,978
walked me to school.

441
00:40:14,315 --> 00:40:16,717
You should pray
to that guardian angel.

442
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,023
♪ 'Cause I'm stranded
on my own ♪

443
00:40:25,393 --> 00:40:28,696
♪ Stranded far from home... ♪

444
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:34,568
Henry?

445
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:48,481
Henry?

446
00:41:04,598 --> 00:41:05,933
Amy.

447
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,272
I'm in Hell.

448
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:29,590
Amy, honey, it's Dad.

449
00:41:29,724 --> 00:41:30,992
You have to listen, okay?

450
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,259
Daddy?

451
00:41:32,393 --> 00:41:34,128
You're all going to die.

452
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:40,001
Mom! Mom, it was Daddy.

453
00:41:40,134 --> 00:41:41,102
It was Dad.
Amy.

454
00:41:41,235 --> 00:41:42,169
I heard Dad's voice.

455
00:41:42,303 --> 00:41:43,471
I heard his voice
on the phone.

456
00:41:43,604 --> 00:41:44,939
He said that we're all
gonna die.

457
00:41:45,072 --> 00:41:46,540
What?
He said
that we were all gonna die.

458
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:47,708
Oh, my God.

459
00:41:52,313 --> 00:41:53,314
What do we do?

460
00:41:55,216 --> 00:41:56,183
Coffee.

461
00:41:58,953 --> 00:42:02,089
Uh, the demons, they grow
more strong in the night.

462
00:42:02,223 --> 00:42:03,724
I'm going to need
my energy.

463
00:42:03,858 --> 00:42:06,160
But you should try
to get some rest.

464
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:14,602
Amen.

465
00:42:14,735 --> 00:42:16,505
How long will this take?

466
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:17,838
That is hard to say.

467
00:42:17,972 --> 00:42:19,874
Hours.

468
00:42:20,007 --> 00:42:21,575
Days, maybe.

469
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:23,512
This demon
is very strong.

470
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:25,546
The boy won't last long.

471
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:28,416
What we need to do
is to find out its name

472
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:29,717
in order to exorcise it.

473
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:32,386
That is the only way
we can save the boy.

474
00:42:32,521 --> 00:42:34,021
How do we do that?

475
00:42:34,155 --> 00:42:35,356
With prayer.

476
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:37,391
Constant prayer.

477
00:42:37,526 --> 00:42:40,661
The demons,
they are self-preserving.

478
00:42:40,795 --> 00:42:43,030
They do not understand
suffering.

479
00:42:43,164 --> 00:42:44,865
Eventually,
he will give himself up

480
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:48,002
because he cannot stand
the pain of the prayer.

481
00:42:48,135 --> 00:42:49,470
You understand me?

482
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:51,540
Yes.
Good. Good.

483
00:42:51,672 --> 00:42:54,275
Now, you must confess
your sins.
Now?

484
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:57,711
The demon can smell your sins
if they are not absolved. Come.

485
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:02,416
We begin.

486
00:43:04,085 --> 00:43:07,421
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

487
00:43:07,556 --> 00:43:10,958
It has been, uh... eight months
since my last confession...

488
00:43:12,126 --> 00:43:13,761
Did you just say eight months

489
00:43:13,894 --> 00:43:15,062
since your last confession?

490
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:17,932
Yes.
I...

491
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,935
Okay, we just have
to get this done.

492
00:43:21,068 --> 00:43:22,703
Y-You are a man of God,
simple enough.

493
00:43:22,837 --> 00:43:24,238
Sì?
Yes.

494
00:43:24,371 --> 00:43:26,207
And you are very, very sorry
for all of your sins.

495
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,542
Sì?
Yes.

496
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:28,909
Okay.

497
00:43:29,043 --> 00:43:31,112
May Almighty God
have mercy on you

498
00:43:31,245 --> 00:43:35,883
and having forgiven your sins,
lead you to eternal peace.

499
00:43:36,016 --> 00:43:37,251
Amen.

500
00:43:37,384 --> 00:43:39,820
What rites of the exorcism
do you know?

501
00:43:39,954 --> 00:43:42,123
Uh... none.
None?

502
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:43,791
It has never come up.

503
00:43:43,924 --> 00:43:45,659
What prayer do you know that
you could say over and over,

504
00:43:45,793 --> 00:43:47,461
even under pressure?

505
00:43:48,796 --> 00:43:49,997
The Hail Mary.

506
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:52,967
But if it is
under pressure,

507
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,537
I would prefer to say it
in Spanish.

508
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:56,605
That's fine.

509
00:43:57,606 --> 00:44:00,875
Your job is to pray.

510
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:03,110
Do not engage
with the demon.

511
00:44:03,244 --> 00:44:06,313
Do not respond to anything
it says or does.

512
00:44:06,447 --> 00:44:09,216
Your job is to be
<i>implacabile.</i>

513
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,620
Relentless. Okay?

514
00:44:12,753 --> 00:44:13,954
Good boy.

515
00:44:14,088 --> 00:44:16,056
Do you know any jokes?

516
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,691
Uh, no.

517
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:19,193
You should learn some.

518
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:20,794
The devil does not like jokes.

519
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:23,364
Bring the box.

520
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:31,939
I see you've brought
your friend.

521
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:35,276
He looks a little scared, Gabe.

522
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:40,515
Mind if I call you Gabe, Gabe?

523
00:44:41,616 --> 00:44:43,684
Readying for battle?

524
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:45,853
You ran out on me
last time,

525
00:44:45,986 --> 00:44:49,890
like the coward you are,
soldier boy.

526
00:44:50,024 --> 00:44:52,960
Not very becoming
of the Chief Exorcist.

527
00:44:53,093 --> 00:44:54,596
Who do you want
to be vanquished by today,

528
00:44:54,728 --> 00:44:56,565
Jesus or his mother?

529
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:57,932
Fuck the Holy Mother.

530
00:44:58,065 --> 00:44:59,934
Are we going to talk all night,

531
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:01,536
or do you want to battle?

532
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:04,772
Know what I'm going to do
to you, Gabriele?

533
00:45:04,905 --> 00:45:06,774
I'm going to fuck you.

534
00:45:07,975 --> 00:45:10,377
You'll sense yourself coming,

535
00:45:10,512 --> 00:45:12,046
and you'll hate yourself

536
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:14,516
for the release you feel
when I fuck you.

537
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:17,552
Now we pray.

538
00:45:20,421 --> 00:45:23,791
I command you, unclean spirit,
whoever you are,

539
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:25,660
along with all of your minions

540
00:45:25,793 --> 00:45:28,262
now attacking this servant
of God, Henry,

541
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:30,497
by the mysteries
of the incarnation...

542
00:45:30,632 --> 00:45:32,099
Fuck you and your incarnations.

543
00:45:32,233 --> 00:45:33,367
...passion, resurrection,
and ascension

544
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,369
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

545
00:45:35,502 --> 00:45:37,738
by the descent
of the Holy Spirit,

546
00:45:37,871 --> 00:45:39,674
by the coming of our Lord
for judgment,

547
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:42,276
that you tell me
by some sign your name

548
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:45,079
and the day and hour
of your departure.

549
00:45:45,212 --> 00:45:47,448
Tomás, pray. Pray.

550
00:45:47,582 --> 00:45:49,584
I command you, moreover,

551
00:45:49,718 --> 00:45:51,418
to obey me to the letter,

552
00:45:51,553 --> 00:45:54,788
I who am a minister of God
despite my unworthiness...

553
00:46:18,379 --> 00:46:20,948
Rosaria?

554
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:24,351
Your sins will seek you out.

555
00:46:24,485 --> 00:46:26,521
My sins have been forgiven.

556
00:46:26,655 --> 00:46:30,558
But you can't forgive yourself,
can you, Father?

557
00:46:31,693 --> 00:46:33,494
Not for me,

558
00:46:33,628 --> 00:46:35,829
the girl you let die.

559
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:39,300
Why did you do nothing?

560
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:41,335
Why didn't you believe me?

561
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:43,070
Now I am in Hell!

562
00:46:43,203 --> 00:46:44,972
Deceiver.

563
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:47,241
Her soul rests in peace.

564
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:50,911
My soul rots in Hell!

565
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,728
How touching.

566
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,195
Is that all you got?

567
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:11,031
And how about you,
panty sniffer?

568
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:14,636
You didn't tell him,
did you?

569
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:17,338
About your little whore?

570
00:47:17,471 --> 00:47:21,475
Your little sweet treat,
Adella.

571
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:23,977
After you stood before
your congregation

572
00:47:24,111 --> 00:47:25,979
like you're better than them,

573
00:47:26,113 --> 00:47:28,148
when you're fucking
their daughters.

574
00:47:28,282 --> 00:47:32,119
Maybe you aren't so sorry
about that sin, hmm?

575
00:47:32,252 --> 00:47:34,121
Shut up.
Tomás. Tomás.

576
00:47:34,254 --> 00:47:36,691
Do not speak to it.
Pray.

577
00:47:36,825 --> 00:47:38,292
Run away.

578
00:47:38,425 --> 00:47:41,195
You don't want
to be here, Tomás.

579
00:47:41,328 --> 00:47:43,897
You'd rather be fucking
that little whore.

580
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:47,569
Tomás! Tomás! No, no, no!

581
00:47:47,702 --> 00:47:49,970
That's what it wants.

582
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,580
You've been played, Amorth.

583
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,683
You took the bait.

584
00:48:02,983 --> 00:48:05,520
And I'll destroy you.

585
00:48:05,653 --> 00:48:09,456
Your Holy Church will crumble
from the inside.

586
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,616
She was
the love of my life.

587
00:49:16,457 --> 00:49:18,593
A promise was made.

588
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:25,533
She wanted me to leave
the priesthood for her...

589
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:32,540
...but I had no intention
of doing that.

590
00:49:33,842 --> 00:49:37,010
So I just told her
what she wanted.

591
00:49:42,817 --> 00:49:44,686
My love for God...

592
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:48,923
it outweighed my love for her.

593
00:49:49,056 --> 00:49:51,291
Are you sorry for your sins?

594
00:49:51,425 --> 00:49:53,994
Yes.

595
00:49:54,127 --> 00:49:56,497
May Almighty God
show you mercy.

596
00:49:56,631 --> 00:49:59,466
And having forgiven
your sins,

597
00:49:59,601 --> 00:50:03,003
may he lead you
to eternal life.

598
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:06,574
Amen.

599
00:50:07,976 --> 00:50:09,911
Amen.

600
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:19,086
Who is... Rosaria?

601
00:50:22,957 --> 00:50:25,827
She is a girl
that I should've helped.

602
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,029
The demon is using her memory
to deceive me.

603
00:50:29,162 --> 00:50:30,765
How does it know these things?

604
00:50:30,899 --> 00:50:33,066
It can sense our guilt,

605
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,471
and it uses it against us
as a distraction.

606
00:50:39,007 --> 00:50:42,577
That boy, he does not have long
before he expires.

607
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:45,547
We need to find out
the name of this demon.

608
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,082
Knowing its name,
it weakens them.

609
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:50,985
I didn't mean to hurt him.

610
00:50:51,118 --> 00:50:53,086
I understand.

611
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,354
See here.

612
00:50:54,488 --> 00:50:56,256
I have marked this page
for you.

613
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:58,158
Learn that.

614
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:02,664
But i-it is in Latin.

615
00:51:02,797 --> 00:51:04,599
Close enough to Spanish.

616
00:51:04,732 --> 00:51:07,569
Prayer has more power
in Latin.

617
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,141
"You have taken the bait."

618
00:51:15,275 --> 00:51:16,276
What?

619
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,046
What it said to me.

620
00:51:18,178 --> 00:51:20,648
"You have taken the bait,
Amorth."

621
00:51:24,052 --> 00:51:26,054
This is not about the boy.

622
00:51:26,186 --> 00:51:27,555
It has a bigger plan.

623
00:51:27,689 --> 00:51:29,791
I need to check something
I saw in the garden.

624
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:31,091
Go. Take this.

625
00:51:31,224 --> 00:51:33,828
Be outside his door.
He is still in danger.

626
00:51:33,962 --> 00:51:35,663
We must protect him
at all cost.

627
00:51:35,797 --> 00:51:37,497
Do whatever you have to.

628
00:51:53,748 --> 00:51:56,416
The seal of the Vatican.

629
00:51:56,551 --> 00:51:59,887
This place has given
the Church problems before.

630
00:53:11,491 --> 00:53:12,827
Help me.

631
00:53:20,068 --> 00:53:21,602
Henry?

632
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:24,132
Henry?

633
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:40,848
No one's getting out
of here alive.

634
00:54:43,316 --> 00:54:44,451
No one.

635
00:55:41,275 --> 00:55:43,511
Let's see what secrets
you are hiding.

636
00:56:07,535 --> 00:56:08,636
What happened?

637
00:56:16,677 --> 00:56:18,713
Go!

638
00:56:33,493 --> 00:56:35,229
Help me!
Amorth!

639
00:56:37,198 --> 00:56:40,768
Help me! Help!

640
00:56:40,902 --> 00:56:42,036
Amy!

641
00:56:46,941 --> 00:56:49,977
Amy! Amy!

642
00:56:55,383 --> 00:56:58,119
Amy. Amy. Oh, my God. Oh, Amy.

643
00:57:22,944 --> 00:57:25,413
It's one of her nails.

644
00:57:25,546 --> 00:57:27,915
Tomás,
take them to the chapel.

645
00:57:41,996 --> 00:57:44,765
Everything is redacted.

646
00:57:47,768 --> 00:57:50,671
"Our sins will seek us out."

647
00:58:05,987 --> 00:58:07,288
Are you okay?

648
00:58:07,421 --> 00:58:08,823
Yes.

649
00:58:08,956 --> 00:58:10,791
You don't
get to stay handsome

650
00:58:10,925 --> 00:58:12,259
in this business
for too long.

651
00:58:12,393 --> 00:58:14,195
Please, hmm? Don't.

652
00:58:14,328 --> 00:58:19,266
I once have a demon try to put
a crucifix into my eyeball.

653
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,102
You're always talking
and talking. Enough.

654
00:58:21,235 --> 00:58:22,770
Please.
Shh.

655
00:58:22,903 --> 00:58:24,205
They're sleeping.

656
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:25,406
No more stories.

657
00:58:28,776 --> 00:58:32,146
Did you consider
why the demon does this?

658
00:58:32,279 --> 00:58:33,714
To scare us, hmm?

659
00:58:33,848 --> 00:58:35,383
For what benefit?

660
00:58:35,516 --> 00:58:36,851
Chaos.

661
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:39,487
Distraction.

662
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,722
The devil
is the great deceiver.

663
00:58:41,856 --> 00:58:43,824
He can make you see things
from your past.

664
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:47,528
Apparitions, memories,
always trying to deceive us.

665
00:58:47,661 --> 00:58:50,264
So we never know
what he's thinking,

666
00:58:50,398 --> 00:58:52,433
what he's planning.

667
00:58:52,566 --> 00:58:55,302
If you do not believe me,

668
00:58:55,436 --> 00:58:57,338
just ask my friend.

669
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,009
Come, I'll show you
what I found.

670
00:59:02,143 --> 00:59:03,811
Amorth!

671
00:59:03,944 --> 00:59:05,980
I noticed this
when I first arrived.

672
00:59:12,153 --> 00:59:13,754
What is this?

673
00:59:13,888 --> 00:59:16,023
You recognize this?

674
00:59:16,157 --> 00:59:18,559
Yes, it's the seal
of the Spanish Inquisition.

675
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:23,197
Sì. The darkest time
in the history of the Church.

676
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,565
And they are...?

677
00:59:25,699 --> 00:59:26,767
The victims.

678
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:29,236
The ones
who would not convert.

679
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:33,107
There is something
underneath this place.

680
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,810
Something is hidden here.
Come.

681
00:59:59,867 --> 01:00:00,968
Hold this.

682
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:12,046
Two crossed keys.

683
01:00:12,179 --> 01:00:13,481
Do you recognize this?

684
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:15,216
It's the Vatican Seal.

685
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:16,317
Sì, sì.

686
01:00:18,085 --> 01:00:19,320
Is it gas?

687
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:22,389
A little gas. A little sulfur.

688
01:00:22,524 --> 01:00:23,624
A little death.

689
01:00:23,757 --> 01:00:25,426
So, no smoking, huh?

690
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,994
Stand back.

691
01:00:38,939 --> 01:00:39,840
It's a door.

692
01:00:39,974 --> 01:00:41,809
Push with me.
Okay.

693
01:01:04,732 --> 01:01:06,000
Catacomb.

694
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:08,769
This is how they would bury
the dead.

695
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:24,718
I understand the Vatican
sealing this place off.

696
01:01:26,754 --> 01:01:29,156
But why would they
leave someone?

697
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:32,026
The ring of
the Cardinal Protector.

698
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:38,832
He was the final hope.

699
01:01:38,966 --> 01:01:40,535
The last protector.

700
01:01:42,637 --> 01:01:46,508
It looks like he is a prisoner,
but he is not.

701
01:01:46,641 --> 01:01:50,277
The cage is for his own safety.

702
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:55,517
They do this
when an exorcism fails.

703
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:57,718
To protect against
the demons escaped,

704
01:01:57,851 --> 01:02:01,690
to trap something
they need to remain hidden.

705
01:02:04,825 --> 01:02:07,761
Tomás, see if you
can open this gate.

706
01:02:32,386 --> 01:02:33,655
It's locked.

707
01:02:33,787 --> 01:02:38,892
Then our friend here
must have a key.

708
01:02:44,965 --> 01:02:47,334
Where did you hide your key?

709
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:52,773
In the stomach.

710
01:02:56,578 --> 01:02:57,811
Forgive me.

711
01:03:14,795 --> 01:03:16,130
Try this.

712
01:03:16,263 --> 01:03:18,667
Huh?

713
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,334
Come.

714
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:51,965
Gabriele. Gabriele.

715
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:01,408
It worked.

716
01:04:01,543 --> 01:04:03,645
Ah.

717
01:04:04,779 --> 01:04:06,213
Thank you, my friend.

718
01:04:19,594 --> 01:04:21,161
Amy?

719
01:04:37,344 --> 01:04:40,280
The gases and the sulfur,
it's getting stronger.

720
01:04:42,851 --> 01:04:45,285
We are getting closer
to Hell.

721
01:05:01,168 --> 01:05:03,805
Cardinal Sullivan,
is he all right?

722
01:05:03,937 --> 01:05:06,708
- He collapsed.
- Holy Father.

723
01:05:11,145 --> 01:05:12,781
Tell him.

724
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:14,883
Tell who?

725
01:05:16,851 --> 01:05:18,853
Gabriele.

726
01:05:18,986 --> 01:05:20,421
Gabriele?

727
01:05:20,555 --> 01:05:22,524
Sì.
Amorth?

728
01:05:24,091 --> 01:05:26,393
Sì.
Amorth?

729
01:05:26,528 --> 01:05:29,062
What trouble has he
got us into this time?

730
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:35,269
The Friar de Ojeda.

731
01:05:37,104 --> 01:05:40,307
One of the greatest exorcists
of all time.

732
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,315
The seal of
the Spanish Inquisition.

733
01:05:55,456 --> 01:05:57,424
His journal.

734
01:05:57,559 --> 01:06:01,995
"Today, I was summoned
to the town of Segovia."

735
01:06:02,129 --> 01:06:03,631
A possessed monk.

736
01:06:03,765 --> 01:06:06,500
"In the year of our Lord
1475..."

737
01:06:08,502 --> 01:06:10,971
"...while questioning the demon
possessing the monk,

738
01:06:11,104 --> 01:06:14,441
"he answered me
from the mouth of another.

739
01:06:14,576 --> 01:06:16,477
And then a third."

740
01:06:16,611 --> 01:06:18,680
Multiple possessions.

741
01:06:18,813 --> 01:06:20,481
It's a powerful demon.

742
01:06:20,615 --> 01:06:21,850
Sì.

743
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:40,969
Amy?

744
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:57,886
The exorcist becomes
possessed himself.

745
01:06:58,653 --> 01:06:59,888
Friar de Ojeda?

746
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:01,656
You know he is the man

747
01:07:01,789 --> 01:07:03,691
who convinced Queen Isabella

748
01:07:03,825 --> 01:07:05,693
of the need for an Inquisition.

749
01:07:05,827 --> 01:07:10,330
So that means, from the time
he is possessed in 1475,

750
01:07:10,464 --> 01:07:13,568
everything that happens
after this...

751
01:07:14,702 --> 01:07:16,303
...is the work of the devil.

752
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:20,575
Centuries of persecution
and torture,

753
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:22,977
the worst abuses
of the Inquisition,

754
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:27,214
all started by the friar,
and done in the name of God...

755
01:07:27,347 --> 01:07:29,149
by the devil.

756
01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:31,886
The Vatican must have
known this.

757
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:34,254
The Church covered it up,

758
01:07:34,388 --> 01:07:36,356
and they buried the truth here.

759
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:39,393
"Your sins
will seek you out."

760
01:07:39,527 --> 01:07:42,195
The construction work
must have freed the demon.

761
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:45,098
Amy?

762
01:07:51,271 --> 01:07:52,205
Amy?

763
01:07:56,611 --> 01:07:58,478
Henry.

764
01:07:58,613 --> 01:08:00,414
It's okay, Mommy.

765
01:08:00,548 --> 01:08:02,282
Henry's okay.

766
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:04,652
Oh, that's great.

767
01:08:04,786 --> 01:08:07,154
Listen, Amy, why don't you
come downstairs with me?

768
01:08:07,287 --> 01:08:08,890
I'm sorry, Mom.

769
01:08:09,023 --> 01:08:11,059
I don't know what got into me.

770
01:08:12,894 --> 01:08:14,829
Well, that's okay.

771
01:08:14,963 --> 01:08:16,731
That's okay. I just...

772
01:08:16,864 --> 01:08:18,900
I just need your sister
for a minute. Amy...

773
01:08:19,033 --> 01:08:20,400
Can you forgive me, Mom?

774
01:08:31,512 --> 01:08:34,782
"The great dragon
was hurled down.

775
01:08:34,916 --> 01:08:38,586
Hurled into the earth,
where he was bound."

776
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,822
"And his angels with him."

777
01:08:40,955 --> 01:08:42,824
Revelations.

778
01:08:42,957 --> 01:08:46,393
200 rogue angels
buried into the earth.

779
01:08:46,527 --> 01:08:49,864
This abbey is one of
those godforsaken places.

780
01:08:49,998 --> 01:08:52,432
This demon,
he was trying to find them.

781
01:08:52,567 --> 01:08:53,968
To raise an army

782
01:08:54,102 --> 01:08:56,203
and destroy the Church.

783
01:08:56,336 --> 01:08:57,605
Amy, come here.

784
01:08:57,739 --> 01:08:59,807
What's in your hand, Mommy?

785
01:09:00,842 --> 01:09:01,976
Amy, come here right now.

786
01:09:02,110 --> 01:09:04,344
What's in your hand, Mommy?!

787
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,331
Look.

788
01:09:27,735 --> 01:09:29,503
Watch me, Mommy.

789
01:09:29,637 --> 01:09:30,705
Watch me.

790
01:09:45,185 --> 01:09:47,989
His name...

791
01:09:48,122 --> 01:09:50,091
the king of Hell.

792
01:09:51,358 --> 01:09:52,760
Asmodeus.

793
01:10:02,003 --> 01:10:03,503
Quickly!

794
01:10:07,909 --> 01:10:10,178
Amy, use the sedative.

795
01:10:18,186 --> 01:10:19,887
Tie his arms.

796
01:10:29,362 --> 01:10:31,231
We have his name.

797
01:10:39,507 --> 01:10:41,209
"Bring me the priest."

798
01:10:42,342 --> 01:10:43,778
What did you say?

799
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:46,279
Those were the first words
the demon said.

800
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:48,281
"Bring me the priest."

801
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:51,119
It didn't mean me.

802
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:52,486
It wants you.

803
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:55,288
This demon feeds on exorcists.

804
01:10:55,422 --> 01:10:58,325
He had a plan once.

805
01:10:58,458 --> 01:11:00,427
To lure the friar here...

806
01:11:01,562 --> 01:11:02,597
...hide amongst the righteous

807
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:03,898
and commit heinous acts

808
01:11:04,031 --> 01:11:05,233
in the name of God.

809
01:11:05,365 --> 01:11:07,501
It wants to do
the same thing again.

810
01:11:07,635 --> 01:11:10,403
Using me to infiltrate
the Church.

811
01:11:10,538 --> 01:11:12,974
What greater victory
for the devil...

812
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:17,410
than to claim the soul
of the Pope's exorcist.

813
01:11:17,545 --> 01:11:21,314
Maybe, but we know
his name now.

814
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:24,484
So we have what we need
to beat it

815
01:11:24,619 --> 01:11:27,088
and to save the child.

816
01:11:27,221 --> 01:11:30,892
The only thing that can
defeat us is ourselves.

817
01:11:33,561 --> 01:11:36,429
He will use your sins
against you.

818
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,935
I need to make confession.

819
01:11:42,236 --> 01:11:43,403
To me?

820
01:11:43,538 --> 01:11:45,072
You are a priest,
are you not?

821
01:11:47,809 --> 01:11:50,778
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

822
01:11:50,912 --> 01:11:53,247
Trust in the Lord.

823
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:58,619
I want to talk to you

824
01:11:58,753 --> 01:12:02,290
about things
I have confessed before,

825
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:04,892
but they still burden me.

826
01:12:05,026 --> 01:12:08,229
In 1942,

827
01:12:08,361 --> 01:12:10,463
during the war,
I joined the Resistance.

828
01:12:10,598 --> 01:12:13,301
I became a partisan and
I fought against the fascists.

829
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:18,873
So many of my friends
would die to German bullets.

830
01:12:21,943 --> 01:12:25,313
Why them and not me?

831
01:12:27,281 --> 01:12:30,718
Their dead bodies
would talk to me in my dreams.

832
01:12:31,786 --> 01:12:33,888
To die in a war is heroic.

833
01:12:34,989 --> 01:12:38,559
To survive a war... complex.

834
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:46,534
And then I begin to see
that my life had been spared.

835
01:12:46,667 --> 01:12:48,970
It was my responsibility
to give it purpose.

836
01:12:49,103 --> 01:12:51,873
And in my case,
that meant to serve God.

837
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:56,143
In all of my years,

838
01:12:56,277 --> 01:12:59,080
I have tried to embrace
what is said in Matthew.

839
01:12:59,213 --> 01:13:03,017
"What you do
for the least among you,

840
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:05,385
you do for me."

841
01:13:05,519 --> 01:13:07,788
But when it mattered...

842
01:13:08,856 --> 01:13:10,124
I failed.

843
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:19,233
I did not help her,
I did not believe her.

844
01:13:19,367 --> 01:13:21,569
I did not listen.

845
01:13:21,702 --> 01:13:23,804
Rosaria?
Sì.

846
01:13:23,938 --> 01:13:25,373
Rosaria.

847
01:13:25,506 --> 01:13:26,540
At night,

848
01:13:26,674 --> 01:13:28,709
the devil fucks me.

849
01:13:28,843 --> 01:13:31,846
What does this devil look like?

850
01:13:33,848 --> 01:13:34,749
You.

851
01:13:44,558 --> 01:13:47,194
She was not possessed.

852
01:13:47,328 --> 01:13:49,864
She was mentally disturbed.

853
01:13:49,997 --> 01:13:54,201
So I let someone else
handle her case.

854
01:13:55,336 --> 01:13:59,006
Again, my pride.

855
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:00,775
I was an exorcist.

856
01:14:00,908 --> 01:14:04,412
The mentally disturbed,
it's not my job.

857
01:14:04,545 --> 01:14:07,515
Do you believe me now?

858
01:14:07,648 --> 01:14:11,118
But that all changed
because of her.

859
01:14:17,658 --> 01:14:21,662
To hear after her death

860
01:14:21,796 --> 01:14:25,032
the rumors of the sexual abuse,
the cover-up

861
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:27,601
within the walls
of the Vatican City.

862
01:14:29,103 --> 01:14:30,972
That innocent girl.

863
01:14:32,606 --> 01:14:35,743
I did not help her
when she needed me.

864
01:14:38,446 --> 01:14:43,084
Her soul is my burden.

865
01:14:43,217 --> 01:14:44,819
And this demon, he knows that.

866
01:14:50,758 --> 01:14:52,827
I know you

867
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,864
as a humble man of God,
Father Amorth.

868
01:14:58,099 --> 01:15:00,868
It's time to lay down
that burden.

869
01:15:01,002 --> 01:15:03,004
Forgive me, Father.

870
01:15:04,939 --> 01:15:07,174
I absolve you of your sins

871
01:15:07,308 --> 01:15:10,211
in the name of the Father,
of the Son

872
01:15:10,344 --> 01:15:12,913
and of the Holy Spirit.

873
01:15:13,047 --> 01:15:14,382
Amen.

874
01:15:46,515 --> 01:15:50,017
I give you
the Miraculous Medal.

875
01:15:50,151 --> 01:15:51,852
Holy fire insurance.

876
01:15:51,986 --> 01:15:53,154
Very powerful.

877
01:15:55,689 --> 01:15:58,092
To defeat
the king of Hell,

878
01:15:58,225 --> 01:16:00,428
we require
the armor of God.

879
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:06,600
To defeat the king of Hell,

880
01:16:06,734 --> 01:16:08,936
we require
the armor of God.

881
01:16:25,719 --> 01:16:29,623
Remember, the demon will use
your sense against you.

882
01:16:31,025 --> 01:16:35,129
Do not believe everything
you see or hear.

883
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:38,099
We have work to do.

884
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:42,103
We must save this child.

885
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:17,671
All done confessing?

886
01:17:17,805 --> 01:17:19,373
Padre.

887
01:17:19,508 --> 01:17:22,943
Did he bare his soul
to you, Tomás?

888
01:17:23,077 --> 01:17:25,980
Like your little whore
bared her breasts?

889
01:17:27,848 --> 01:17:30,184
Ignore it.
Pray for Henry.

890
01:17:30,317 --> 01:17:32,853
No amount of prayers
can save Henry.

891
01:17:32,987 --> 01:17:35,557
Let me in, Gabriele.

892
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:37,626
You know what I want.

893
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:40,661
Our Father...

894
01:17:40,794 --> 01:17:43,697
who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

895
01:17:43,831 --> 01:17:46,066
Was there really any point

896
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,903
confessing to your god, Gabe?

897
01:17:49,036 --> 01:17:50,471
Give us this day
our daily bread...

898
01:17:50,605 --> 01:17:52,507
Shouldn't you be confessing
to her?

899
01:18:02,883 --> 01:18:05,654
You... are not there.

900
01:18:05,786 --> 01:18:08,523
You are only in my mind.

901
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:12,326
I burn in Hell because of you!

902
01:18:12,459 --> 01:18:13,928
You are not there.

903
01:18:15,296 --> 01:18:17,331
You are only in my mind.

904
01:18:19,967 --> 01:18:21,202
Father.

905
01:18:21,335 --> 01:18:23,370
Join us in Hell, Gabe.

906
01:18:23,504 --> 01:18:24,573
Take me in.

907
01:18:24,705 --> 01:18:27,408
Don't you want me, Tomás?

908
01:18:27,542 --> 01:18:31,178
Tell me to get on my knees
and say my prayers.

909
01:18:31,312 --> 01:18:32,681
Fuck me, Tomás.

910
01:18:32,813 --> 01:18:34,982
Deceiver.

911
01:18:35,115 --> 01:18:36,717
Fuck me, Tomás!
Deceiver!

912
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:37,818
Fuck me, priest.

913
01:18:37,952 --> 01:18:39,053
Oh, God.

914
01:18:39,186 --> 01:18:40,321
Tomás, focus on the prayer.

915
01:18:40,454 --> 01:18:42,423
Asmodeus!

916
01:18:42,557 --> 01:18:44,258
Asmodeus, king of Gehenna,

917
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:46,561
this is the Cross of the Lord!

918
01:18:46,695 --> 01:18:48,229
Release this child

919
01:18:48,362 --> 01:18:51,198
and flee from the light of God!

920
01:18:51,332 --> 01:18:52,733
See thee beneath God!

921
01:18:52,866 --> 01:18:54,335
Never! Get out!

922
01:18:54,468 --> 01:18:55,336
Get out of my house!

923
01:18:55,469 --> 01:18:56,605
This is the house of God!

924
01:18:56,737 --> 01:18:57,938
Not without my son!

925
01:18:58,072 --> 01:18:59,273
Your son is gone!

926
01:18:59,406 --> 01:19:01,342
His soul burns
and rots in Hell.

927
01:19:01,475 --> 01:19:03,744
Admit to thy name, Asmodeus!
Never!

928
01:19:03,877 --> 01:19:06,113
And bow to the power
of God Almighty!

929
01:19:06,247 --> 01:19:07,549
Take me in, Gabe!

930
01:19:07,682 --> 01:19:09,283
Oh, Mary,
Most High Queen of Heaven...

931
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:10,751
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among...

932
01:19:10,884 --> 01:19:12,086
...and of the Angels,

933
01:19:12,219 --> 01:19:13,420
- and Mother of God...
- I am king!

934
01:19:13,555 --> 01:19:15,222
You are under my dominion!

935
01:19:15,356 --> 01:19:17,726
We humbly beseech you...
And here you will remain,

936
01:19:17,858 --> 01:19:19,594
damned forever!
...the power and the mission...

937
01:19:19,728 --> 01:19:21,462
...now and at the hour
of our death.

938
01:19:21,596 --> 01:19:23,130
To crush Satan's skull!

939
01:19:23,264 --> 01:19:25,065
I am Asmodeus,

940
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:28,737
king of Hell,
and I command you!

941
01:19:28,869 --> 01:19:30,938
We beseech thee
to send thy holy angels...

942
01:19:32,139 --> 01:19:33,575
...that under thy command

943
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:36,310
and by thy power, they may
pursue the evil spirits,

944
01:19:36,443 --> 01:19:38,779
encounter them on every side,

945
01:19:38,912 --> 01:19:41,849
resist their bold attacks,
and drive them hence

946
01:19:41,982 --> 01:19:44,451
into the abyss of woe!

947
01:19:59,601 --> 01:20:00,669
Mommy?

948
01:20:03,137 --> 01:20:06,307
Mom, help me.

949
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,375
Speak to him, Julia.
Speak to him.

950
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:10,010
A mother's love never fails.

951
01:20:10,144 --> 01:20:12,313
Henry! Henry, I love you.

952
01:20:12,446 --> 01:20:14,616
Call to him.
Henry, come back to me.

953
01:20:14,749 --> 01:20:17,519
Henry, please talk to me.

954
01:20:20,954 --> 01:20:23,924
Mommy, they're hurting me.

955
01:20:24,058 --> 01:20:27,127
Oh, God.
Henry, we need your help.

956
01:20:27,261 --> 01:20:28,763
You must resist.

957
01:20:28,896 --> 01:20:30,030
I can't.

958
01:20:30,164 --> 01:20:31,465
You must resist.

959
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,536
Mom?

960
01:20:38,138 --> 01:20:39,106
Henry.

961
01:20:52,787 --> 01:20:54,221
What's happening?

962
01:20:59,026 --> 01:21:00,194
Oh, my God.

963
01:21:00,327 --> 01:21:01,529
Holy shit.

964
01:21:01,663 --> 01:21:04,498
The omnipotent.

965
01:21:10,971 --> 01:21:12,172
It's in them both.

966
01:21:20,682 --> 01:21:22,916
Amy.

967
01:21:50,177 --> 01:21:51,613
Give me what I want!
No!

968
01:21:54,682 --> 01:21:57,317
Surrender yourself to me!

969
01:22:07,562 --> 01:22:09,229
Julia!

970
01:22:25,179 --> 01:22:27,047
I told you, bitch.

971
01:22:27,181 --> 01:22:28,650
You're all gonna die!

972
01:22:28,783 --> 01:22:30,984
Amy, please.
Amy's gone.

973
01:22:31,118 --> 01:22:34,388
Julia, resist!

974
01:22:34,522 --> 01:22:35,657
Don't lose faith!

975
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:37,958
Give me back my children!

976
01:22:38,091 --> 01:22:39,794
Your children are gone!

977
01:22:41,094 --> 01:22:43,497
Please. Amy, please.

978
01:22:43,631 --> 01:22:44,933
I love you.

979
01:22:55,075 --> 01:22:57,612
- It's me you want.
- Let the children go.

980
01:22:57,745 --> 01:22:59,413
They all suffer because of you.

981
01:22:59,547 --> 01:23:01,749
Say the words, piggy.

982
01:23:05,753 --> 01:23:08,857
Be the martyr
you dreamed of being.

983
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:11,325
Be my piggy.

984
01:23:11,458 --> 01:23:12,760
Take me.

985
01:23:26,774 --> 01:23:28,008
Mom.

986
01:23:31,178 --> 01:23:33,380
No! Gabriele!

987
01:23:48,796 --> 01:23:51,231
Father.

988
01:23:51,365 --> 01:23:53,166
Father.

989
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,074
Mommy?

990
01:24:02,209 --> 01:24:03,377
What have you done?

991
01:24:03,511 --> 01:24:05,379
Take the cross from my hand.

992
01:24:05,513 --> 01:24:06,548
Okay. Okay.
Take it.

993
01:24:06,681 --> 01:24:08,750
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

994
01:24:08,883 --> 01:24:09,751
It's okay.
Oh, my God.

995
01:24:09,884 --> 01:24:11,385
Henry, you came back to me.

996
01:24:11,519 --> 01:24:12,687
You're safe now.
Take it!

997
01:24:14,522 --> 01:24:15,557
Get them out of here.
Yes.

998
01:24:15,690 --> 01:24:17,357
Go!
Hey. Hey.

999
01:24:17,491 --> 01:24:18,760
Julia, we have to go.

1000
01:24:18,893 --> 01:24:20,360
Please, let's go.
Put your arms around me.

1001
01:24:20,494 --> 01:24:22,597
Come on, run. Amy, come on.

1002
01:24:27,401 --> 01:24:29,169
Your soul is mine.

1003
01:24:39,581 --> 01:24:41,716
Sullivan.

1004
01:24:41,849 --> 01:24:43,250
Sullivan!

1005
01:25:05,073 --> 01:25:07,041
I knew you would
sacrifice yourself

1006
01:25:07,174 --> 01:25:10,410
to save those children,
and now you are mine.

1007
01:25:19,554 --> 01:25:21,254
Come on. Hurry.

1008
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:24,458
The boy, he's safe now.

1009
01:25:24,592 --> 01:25:26,193
Just get away from here.

1010
01:25:29,797 --> 01:25:31,198
Go.
Thank you, Father.

1011
01:25:38,472 --> 01:25:40,474
I need my pig, Gabe.

1012
01:25:49,182 --> 01:25:53,621
You will not take me.
You will not take me!

1013
01:25:55,123 --> 01:25:56,991
You prideful fool.

1014
01:25:57,125 --> 01:25:58,993
The friar said
the exact same thing.

1015
01:26:00,193 --> 01:26:02,630
Forgive me, Lord.

1016
01:26:04,966 --> 01:26:05,900
Not yet.

1017
01:26:06,034 --> 01:26:07,969
I need my pig to get me

1018
01:26:08,102 --> 01:26:09,871
inside the Vatican, Gabe.

1019
01:27:04,892 --> 01:27:06,359
Gabriele!

1020
01:27:16,804 --> 01:27:21,075
Damn us both to Hell.

1021
01:27:56,244 --> 01:27:57,845
Gabriele!

1022
01:28:00,648 --> 01:28:02,016
Gabriele!

1023
01:28:30,011 --> 01:28:32,280
You're too late, Tomás.

1024
01:28:32,412 --> 01:28:36,416
He's gone, your friend.
Gone.

1025
01:28:36,551 --> 01:28:37,819
So...

1026
01:28:39,954 --> 01:28:41,088
...run along.

1027
01:28:42,657 --> 01:28:44,659
It would be my great pleasure

1028
01:28:44,792 --> 01:28:49,797
to excoriate your soul
and eviscerate your memory.

1029
01:28:49,931 --> 01:28:51,799
Gabriele, listen to me.

1030
01:28:51,933 --> 01:28:53,100
Fight it.

1031
01:28:53,234 --> 01:28:55,269
It is just in your head.

1032
01:28:55,402 --> 01:28:57,271
We can only be defeated
by ourselves.

1033
01:28:57,404 --> 01:28:59,507
He is not here!

1034
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:02,610
The little piggy
is slopping at Hell's trough,

1035
01:29:02,743 --> 01:29:04,679
where he belongs.

1036
01:29:04,812 --> 01:29:06,547
I know you're here, Gabriele.

1037
01:29:06,681 --> 01:29:07,648
Pray with me!

1038
01:29:09,617 --> 01:29:13,386
God is not here!

1039
01:29:13,521 --> 01:29:15,823
God is always in our hearts.

1040
01:29:15,957 --> 01:29:17,024
Focus on the prayer.

1041
01:29:18,326 --> 01:29:19,861
Where two of you gather...

1042
01:29:19,994 --> 01:29:21,929
in my name,

1043
01:29:22,063 --> 01:29:23,998
there am I.

1044
01:29:24,131 --> 01:29:26,133
Lord, have mercy.

1045
01:29:26,267 --> 01:29:29,036
Say it! Lord, have mercy!

1046
01:29:32,607 --> 01:29:34,508
God is with you,
Gabriele.

1047
01:29:34,642 --> 01:29:35,843
Find him.

1048
01:29:35,977 --> 01:29:37,778
Finish it, Tomás.

1049
01:29:37,912 --> 01:29:38,846
Finish it.

1050
01:29:59,432 --> 01:30:01,269
Give up. He is mine.

1051
01:30:01,401 --> 01:30:02,737
I adjure you,

1052
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:05,472
in the name
of the spotless lamb.

1053
01:30:05,606 --> 01:30:07,875
The word made flesh
commands you.

1054
01:30:08,009 --> 01:30:09,543
Asmodeus!

1055
01:30:09,677 --> 01:30:12,546
Jesus of Nazareth commands you!

1056
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:17,752
And now I adjure you
in his name!

1057
01:30:19,921 --> 01:30:22,790
Lord, heed my prayer! Say it!

1058
01:30:22,924 --> 01:30:24,659
No!

1059
01:30:27,427 --> 01:30:29,630
- Gabriele.
- We're not done yet.

1060
01:30:35,603 --> 01:30:38,205
You're coming to Hell, priests.

1061
01:30:38,339 --> 01:30:41,309
I will take you both.

1062
01:30:45,913 --> 01:30:46,948
Adella.

1063
01:31:11,138 --> 01:31:13,240
Your sins will seek...

1064
01:31:13,374 --> 01:31:14,608
Seek you out.

1065
01:31:14,742 --> 01:31:16,644
Tomás, use the medal!

1066
01:31:16,777 --> 01:31:19,447
Lord, grant me the power!

1067
01:31:29,423 --> 01:31:31,125
Gabriele!

1068
01:31:32,927 --> 01:31:35,529
Asmodeus! In the name
of the Holy Mother!

1069
01:31:35,663 --> 01:31:38,432
See thee beneath God.

1070
01:31:40,434 --> 01:31:43,137
See thee beneath God!

1071
01:31:44,872 --> 01:31:47,074
Tomás, pray the final rites.

1072
01:31:48,676 --> 01:31:50,144
In the name of the Father...

1073
01:31:51,445 --> 01:31:52,546
...and of the Son

1074
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:55,182
and of the Holy Spirit,

1075
01:31:55,316 --> 01:31:57,184
see thee beneath God!

1076
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:22,043
Gabriele, are you okay?

1077
01:32:27,081 --> 01:32:28,949
Not so bad.

1078
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:35,089
Tomás.
What?

1079
01:32:36,424 --> 01:32:37,925
You look like shit.

1080
01:32:38,059 --> 01:32:39,960
Eh.

1081
01:32:41,996 --> 01:32:44,265
Bless you, Tomás.

1082
01:32:44,398 --> 01:32:46,033
You learned the Latin.

1083
01:32:47,968 --> 01:32:50,604
Yes, it's similar
to the Spanish.

1084
01:32:50,738 --> 01:32:53,374
Very similar to the Spanish.

1085
01:33:02,483 --> 01:33:04,385
You know, the God,

1086
01:33:04,519 --> 01:33:08,557
he works in very
mysterious ways.

1087
01:33:14,061 --> 01:33:15,196
For you.

1088
01:33:23,237 --> 01:33:26,707
Yes, he does.

1089
01:33:35,049 --> 01:33:36,784
Cuckoo.

1090
01:33:44,593 --> 01:33:46,193
Is that you, Gabriele?

1091
01:33:48,929 --> 01:33:51,533
And I have brought
Padre Esquibel to meet you.

1092
01:33:51,665 --> 01:33:53,200
You look well, Your Holiness.

1093
01:33:53,334 --> 01:33:54,768
Thanks to you both.

1094
01:33:54,902 --> 01:33:56,971
I'm glad to see you.

1095
01:33:57,104 --> 01:33:59,106
You had me worried this time.

1096
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,975
Sounded dangerous.

1097
01:34:03,777 --> 01:34:06,515
Sometimes you fly
a little too close to the sun.

1098
01:34:07,648 --> 01:34:09,016
It has not
killed me yet.

1099
01:34:09,150 --> 01:34:11,485
The Church will not forget
what you have done.

1100
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:15,356
You struck a mighty blow
for our side.

1101
01:34:15,489 --> 01:34:19,026
Saint Michael would be proud.
Grazie.

1102
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:22,329
And this is why God
put you here, Gabriele.

1103
01:34:24,533 --> 01:34:28,736
And God has made a good choice
in you, too, Father Esquibel.

1104
01:34:28,869 --> 01:34:30,371
Thank you, Holy Father.

1105
01:34:30,504 --> 01:34:35,843
The congregation has requested
a full report on Spain.

1106
01:34:35,976 --> 01:34:37,378
A full report.

1107
01:34:37,512 --> 01:34:39,346
So Cardinale Sullivan
can tell me again

1108
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:42,149
that evil only exists
in my imagination?

1109
01:34:42,283 --> 01:34:43,817
You haven't heard?

1110
01:34:43,951 --> 01:34:45,520
Cardinal Sullivan has taken

1111
01:34:45,654 --> 01:34:47,821
a sabbatical
in the Isle of Guam.

1112
01:34:50,991 --> 01:34:52,726
I shall pray...

1113
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:54,629
for Guam.

1114
01:34:56,330 --> 01:34:59,833
And who has, uh,
filled his shoes?

1115
01:34:59,967 --> 01:35:03,704
I have found someone
far more trustworthy.

1116
01:35:05,172 --> 01:35:07,642
I will leave you
in his good hands.

1117
01:35:12,146 --> 01:35:15,082
See thee beneath God.

1118
01:35:15,216 --> 01:35:16,651
See thee beneath God.

1119
01:35:22,356 --> 01:35:24,693
Welcome to the holiest
of holies.

1120
01:35:24,825 --> 01:35:27,027
12 centuries of treasures.

1121
01:35:27,161 --> 01:35:29,564
Letters from saints
and apostles.

1122
01:35:29,698 --> 01:35:32,233
Books of wisdom and piety.

1123
01:35:32,366 --> 01:35:34,669
Revelations of the spirit.

1124
01:35:34,802 --> 01:35:37,771
The entire canon
of Christian thought.

1125
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:42,176
The Vatican has purchased the
abbey from the Vasquez family

1126
01:35:42,309 --> 01:35:44,245
and reconsecrated the soil.

1127
01:35:44,378 --> 01:35:47,549
The family has safely
relocated back to the U.S.,

1128
01:35:47,682 --> 01:35:49,883
where the boy made
a full recovery.

1129
01:35:52,253 --> 01:35:53,821
Hmm.

1130
01:35:53,954 --> 01:35:56,625
The friar's diary
is proving very useful

1131
01:35:56,757 --> 01:35:58,627
despite his abhorrence.

1132
01:35:58,759 --> 01:36:00,327
Asmodeus has been defeated,

1133
01:36:00,461 --> 01:36:02,664
but there are many more
to be found.

1134
01:36:02,796 --> 01:36:05,099
Soon, we will know
all of the other

1135
01:36:05,232 --> 01:36:08,469
199 sites on Earth

1136
01:36:08,603 --> 01:36:10,504
where God is not welcome.

1137
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:14,275
Gabriele,
will you take on this task?

1138
01:36:16,645 --> 01:36:21,081
This would be more than a
lifetime's work for one priest.

1139
01:36:22,316 --> 01:36:24,018
But two priests...

1140
01:36:25,553 --> 01:36:26,655
What do you think, Tomás?

1141
01:36:26,787 --> 01:36:28,523
Can you see this now
as a calling?

1142
01:36:28,657 --> 01:36:31,358
And that we must serve God

1143
01:36:31,492 --> 01:36:33,762
the way he wants us
to serve him?

1144
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:37,264
Let's go to work.

1145
01:36:40,234 --> 01:36:41,869
Let's go to Hell.
