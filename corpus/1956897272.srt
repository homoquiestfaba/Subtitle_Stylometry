- Well,
after your history class

1055
00:48:08,798 --> 00:48:12,193
ended my troubled relationship
with authority, I started...

1056
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,455
- all right, you hacked in
and changed your grade

1057
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:14,892
in the school's computer.

1058
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:17,198
- Well, I didn't think
it was fair.

1059
00:48:17,285 --> 00:48:21,072
- Ali wants to build
a factory here.

1060
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:23,988
- I started my own company,
making turbines

1061
00:48:24,075 --> 00:48:26,294
for alternative
energy systems.

1062
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:30,690
After our little
misunderstanding.

1063
00:48:30,777 --> 00:48:32,474
And the towers
went down,

1064
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:36,174
my dad was laid off,
moved to California.

1065
00:48:36,261 --> 00:48:39,394
Like a modern-day Tom joad
from the grapes of wrath.

of the rust bowl.

1068
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,313
The simple fact is,

1069
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,186

on people's jobs.

1070

their hands to work

1071

and build things
they'd be proud of.

1072

in your class.

00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,654
I'd like to create an urban
farm co-op in highland park.

1080
00:49:21,741 --> 00:49:24,048
- What about a Ferrari
or a yacht or your own island?

1081
00:49:24,135 --> 00:49:25,919
- Mr. Howard's
being very modest.

1082
00:49:26,006 --> 00:49:27,616
We had
a fantastic meeting.

1083

He's decided to expand
his local cleanup project,

1084
00:49:31,664 --> 00:49:35,146
and to jump-start it,
he's made the miraculous offer

1085
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:39,498
to donate $1 million
of his winnings.

1086
00:49:39,585 --> 00:49:41,979
- That's a lot of money.
- So he's gonna write a check?

1087
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:45,547

a little bit wrong.

1090
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,250
Um, I've actually
decided to...

1091
00:49:52,337 --> 00:49:55,079
Give...

1092
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:56,515

some after-school activities,
uh, restore some pri...

1098

we're gonna restore
some pride around here.

1099
00:50:08,483 --> 00:50:10,790
- This is great for the kids.
What about...

1100
00:50:10,877 --> 00:50:13,967
- and I am honored
that the mayor

1101
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:16,274
has decided
to match these funds

1102

in order to hire back
some teachers

1103
00:50:17,753 --> 00:50:19,277

the library.

Thank you. Excuse me.

- Has your brother now bid
on the library restoration?

- Yes, it's a very inspired
meeting we had in there.

1110
00:50:30,157 --> 00:50:32,507
Now, they say that money
can't buy everything.

1111
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:34,683
But it can.
That's always confused me.

1112
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:37,164
Because that's what money does,
it buys things.

1113

You know?
[Laughter]

1114
00:50:38,557 --> 00:50:40,646

I'm not gonna let her

give all your money away

just because Shirley beat out
your wife for homecoming queen?

1119

Look, this is a good thing.
It's worthwhile.

1121

have the money in hand

1122

before we spend
any more of it.

would you leave him alone?

You gotta spend your money
on what makes you happy.

Okay?

that she can't get herself.

why would she need me?
