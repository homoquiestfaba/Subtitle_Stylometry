1
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,612
-Yo, fellas, what's up?
-Same ol', same ol'.

2
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:51,239
I got eight-balls, redi-rocks, jumbos.

3
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:54,367
-I even got starter kits.
-Jumbos, two twenties.

4
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:56,578
Two twenties would be $40.

5
00:01:57,537 --> 00:01:59,581
Can you break this?

6
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,546
I ain't no cash machine.

7
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:08,256
You laughin' at me?

8
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:12,594
No, brother. I'm just sayin'....

9
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,471
You laugh at this?

10
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:16,347
Wait!

11
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:23,897
Get the shit.

12
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:27,775
Get the roll.

13
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:30,486
Motherfucker's so dead.

14
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:33,072
Dead all over.

15
00:02:33,156 --> 00:02:34,282
Yeah?

16
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:41,414
You're dead too.

17
00:03:07,732 --> 00:03:09,400
<i>l tell ya, Grandpa.</i>

18
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:12,445
<i>This lot was full
of used cars this afternoon.</i>

19
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:28,461
Crime scenes. Detective Pavletz.
How're you doin', Sarge?

20
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:29,920
Hold on.

21
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:39,138
Okay.

22
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:42,725
"Black male...

23
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:45,185

00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:02,661
"Apparent gunshot victim."

29
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:08,041
What's "apparent," Sarge?

30
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:12,504
"Huge...

00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:16,717

34
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,352
Good enough. All right.

35
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:39,322
Mad Dog. You're up.

36
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:48,415
Ass end of the South Side, right?

37
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:52,335
No, you got a male dead man
in the 14th district. You'll findit.

38
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:54,087
Indoors or outdoors?

39
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:55,672
In a car.

40
00:04:57,883 --> 00:04:59,467
Yo, Mike. You're up.

41
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:00,844
Five more minutes, Ma.

42
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:19,529
Hey, Mad Dog,
you know what I want for Christmas?

43
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:22,198
Sixteen vestal virgins.

44
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:26,744
Fix your collar.

45
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,996
Yeah.

46
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:33,626
That head-in-the-garbage-can job
last night?

47
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:37,046
I told the coroner:
"Just bring a bowling ball bag."

48
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:40,591
Mad Dog, I tell you this,
'cause your partneris brain dead.

49
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:42,218
Get me some Twinkies.

50
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:45,346
There should be a store open
a couple blocks from the scene.

51
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,016
It's 2:00 a.m., you fat fuck.

52
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:50,643
Twinkies. And a banana for this monkey.

53
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:52,145
A green one.

54
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,299
Hey, Mad Dog.

55
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,725
I got some sandwiches over here.

56
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,647
Just your basic dead shitskin.

57
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:39,441
Nobody's beenin the car, right?
It's nice and cherry?

58
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,901
Absolutely.

59
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,449
Brother, you fucked up.

60
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,662
The doer might bein the crowd.
Can you get me a group portrait?

61
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,332
Yeah. Let's do the street.

62
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,264
From the blood on the window...

63
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,850
...l'd say your victim got whacked here.

64
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:16,562
And your shooter was sitting
in the front passenger seat there.

65
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,356
Got a lot of bloodin the door well...

66
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,692
...so the door had to be open at the time.

67
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,111
Maybe he slippedin for a quick sale...

68
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:27,781
...and the deal went sour,
orit was rip-off time and ba-boom.

69
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,909
See the scorch mark over the temple?

70
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:31,952
Yeah.

71
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,788
The muzzle was no more
than threeinches away.

72
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,081
But you see this?

73
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,458
Your blow-back shot a good two feet.

74
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,754
So the shooter's arm
will be covered with blood.

75
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,965
I can tell you more when we pull him out.

76
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,466
This blow-back, too?

77
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,219
-Where?
-Over there on the window.

78
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,348
No blood on the headrest.
Blow-back don't leap over things.

79
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,016
That's somebody else's.

80
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,980
We got a crowbar somewhere?

81
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,568
Hey. It's a doubleheader.

82
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,833
-I'll be right back.
-You're killin' him, Mad Dog.

83
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,502
Get him some Melba toast.

84
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,588
Mike, do me a favor? My name's Wayne.

85
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,057
"Old black magic has meinits spell

86
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,893

Got any Twinkies?

90
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,447
No.

91
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,578
How about Melba toast?

92
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,873
What the hell's Melba toast, right?

93
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,335
Let's see....

94
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,550
What's that?

95
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,554
-A dollar.
-A dollar? Whatis this, a hotel lobby?

96
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,098
Fifty cents.

97
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,610
Jesus! Don't shoot him, please.

98
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,903
Don't shoot!

99
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:37,368
There's a crime scene down the block.
You shoot, they'll hear.

100
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,454
You want the money?
Just takeit. Go out the back.

101
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,664
You takeit yet?

102
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,667
-Did you takeit yet? Jesus Christ.
-Shut up!

103
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,795
You want the money?

104
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:48,921
Here.

105
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:55,261
You smoke?

106
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,054
What do you smoke?

107
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,306
Take some cartons here.

108
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,684
-You like some candy?
-Do you like candy?

109
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,104
-Give him a fuckin' back rub, too.
-I said shut up!

110
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:09,400
Go out the back. You gotta go now.
You gotta go quiet, please.

111
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,485
Call him a cab!

112
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,655
Get the fuck up!

113
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:16,490
Please.

114
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:20,869
Please. Do you like Rice-A-Roni?
How about a nice Diet Sprite?

115
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,164

They're right down the block.

Fuck off.

Call 911. Say that a police officer
needs assistance.

-Just doit. Tell 'em where your storeis.
-This ain't my store.

Thanks, Wayne.

131

Do you want a cup of coffee or something?

132
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:36,087
No, I'll go through the roof.

133
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:40,424
How about a shot of something?
It'll help you sleep.

You know why?

154
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:06,468
Because you're a sensitive,
intelligentindividual.

155
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:10,055
You ever piss on yourself?

156
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:13,767
I'd have walkedin
and drilled the red-eyed bastard.

Let me tell you somethin'.

161
00:14:24,152 --> 00:14:27,280
Next time that happens,
you're that scared...

162
00:14:27,864 --> 00:14:30,075
...the best thingis sex.

163
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,621
You're all adrenalized,
you'll go off like a rocket.

164
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:36,664
Give me a break, will you?

165
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:39,542

I would have called...

tend toincriminate him.

00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,104
No, I'm off tonight.

181
00:15:42,813 --> 00:15:44,774
Really? You got somethin' on?

182
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:47,610
No, I'll just playit by ear.

183
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:52,865
That was balls up what you did last night.
Don't kid yourself.

184
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:59,413
Thanks, Tom. I'll call you later.

185
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,153
Are you Wayne?

186
00:16:32,654 --> 00:16:33,780
Who are you?

187
00:16:33,864 --> 00:16:34,865
Harold.

188
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:38,619
I was over to your apartment.
You weren't there.

189
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:40,662
I work for my boss...

190
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:44,458
...and he asked me to find you
toinvite you to this thing tonight.

191
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,126
It's free with this.

192
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:48,420
The Comic-Cazie Club.

193
00:16:48,503 --> 00:16:50,631
You also get a free drink.

194
00:16:54,634 --> 00:16:56,053
Who's your boss?

195
00:16:56,178 --> 00:17:01,141
He said not to say, but that you know him
and he'd really like to talk to you.

196
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:06,772
Don't worry. It's not a bad thing.
It's a good thing.

197
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:08,940
Whois he, Harold?

198
00:17:09,065 --> 00:17:11,860
It don't start till about 10:00, 10:30...

199
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,155
...but I can come by later
and pick you upif you want.

200
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:19,743
No thanks. I'll pass.

201
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:28,668
That other cop? Your friend?

202
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,754
He's very sarcastic.

203
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,610
<i>Hold it!</i>

204
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:56,029
<i>Don't move!</i>

205
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,073
<i>Don't even breathe.</i>

206
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:13,671
<i>Call it in, Fredo.</i>

207
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,717
<i>Now, Fredo.</i>

208
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:27,518
<i>Hey, I'm the greatest
piece of ass in the world.</i>

209
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:30,646
<i>l'm ballin' this chick.
The planet's fuckin' moving.</i>

210
00:18:32,148 --> 00:18:34,984
<i>Until she said:
"Honey, that was an earthquake."</i>

211
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,615
Nice place,isn'tit?

212
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:44,994
Give him a coffee and cognac.

213
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:46,329
Comin' up.

214
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:48,539
Show her your comp.

215
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:57,631
-Decaf, please.
-Right.

216
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:01,886
Who's your boss?

217
00:19:05,347 --> 00:19:06,932
That's decaf, right?

218
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:09,059
I'm sorry!

219
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,228
I'm sorry.

220
00:19:11,854 --> 00:19:14,440
Can't you use a clean napkin or somethin'?

221
00:19:15,024 --> 00:19:16,275
I'm sorry.

222
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:19,445
-Okay?
-No problem.

223
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:27,536
Takeit with you.

224
00:19:31,874 --> 00:19:33,167
<i>You're wasting time.</i>

225
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,753
<i>Ever notice that all male nightclub singers
do this when they come out?</i>

226
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:38,797
<i>"Everything's gonna be okay</i>

227
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:42,009
<i>"As soon as I get my neck fiixed"</i>

228
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:44,094
<i>Moving right along. And now...</i>

229
00:19:44,178 --> 00:19:47,180
<i>...from Melrose Park,
the land of razor-cut hair...</i>

230
00:19:47,264 --> 00:19:50,517
<i>...l.D. bracelets and velour car interiors...</i>

231
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:54,521
<i>...the comedy stylings of Frank Milo,
ladies and gentlemen. Dig it.</i>

232
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:57,316
Yo, Frankie!

233
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:11,872
<i>Cosa Nostra.</i>

234
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,041
<i>"Our Thing."</i>

235
00:20:21,882 --> 00:20:23,550
<i>"Our Thing, " my ass.</i>

236
00:20:24,426 --> 00:20:28,972
<i>"Cosa Nostra" is ltalian
for "cheap bastards."</i>

237
00:20:32,892 --> 00:20:35,729
<i>The only thing cheaper
than a hood is a cop.</i>

238
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:37,772
<i>Cops. Forget about it.</i>

239
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:40,942
<i>They squeeze the nickel
till the buffalo shits.</i>

240
00:20:44,863 --> 00:20:46,531
<i>Cosa Nostra babies.</i>

241
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:52,287
<i>Other babies, they're born,
they cry, they go: "Wa-wa."</i>

242
00:20:52,704 --> 00:20:54,497
<i>Our kids, they cry.</i>

243
00:20:55,498 --> 00:20:56,666
<i>They go:</i>

244
00:20:57,917 --> 00:20:59,127
<i>"Wha?"</i>

245
00:21:04,173 --> 00:21:05,550
<i>My friend, Angie.</i>

246
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:09,596
<i>Angie's father was on his deathbed.</i>

247
00:21:11,472 --> 00:21:13,683
<i>He calls his sons to him and says:</i>

248
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:16,436
<i>"Put $100 in my coffiin each year...</i>

249
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:19,897
<i>"...in case, you know,
you can take it with you."</i>

250
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,320
<i>The guy dies.</i>

251
00:21:27,947 --> 00:21:32,034
<i>Angie's two brothers
put in their yard each.</i>

252
00:21:32,577 --> 00:21:37,748
<i>Angie drops in a check for $300
and takes out the cash.</i>

253
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,668
That fuckin' Angie!

254
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,048
When did Angie's father die?

255
00:21:50,594 --> 00:21:51,637
<i>Hey.</i>

256
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:56,267
<i>There he is.</i>

257
00:22:01,147 --> 00:22:02,940
They takin' care of you tonight?

258
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:04,316
Yeah, thanks.

259
00:22:05,234 --> 00:22:07,444
Don't let 'em schlong you on tips.

260
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:16,912
I told my therapist about you.
About what happened.

261
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:21,500
And she said that I was
a real suicidal asshole, and...

262
00:22:22,918 --> 00:22:24,044
...that...

263
00:22:24,336 --> 00:22:26,672
...in fact, I was probably very scared...

264
00:22:26,755 --> 00:22:30,592
...and was just resorting to macho bullshit
like I'm programmed to.

265
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:33,345
And that what you did...

266
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:36,765
...was very brave and compassionate...

267
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:40,936
...and that I should both
apologize to you and thank you.

268
00:22:42,271 --> 00:22:43,480
Hey, Frank.

269
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:45,399
Isn't that Phil Donahue?

270
00:22:49,778 --> 00:22:53,282
Put the magazine down
before you hurt yourself, okay, Harold?

271
00:22:55,951 --> 00:22:57,327
Are you married?

272
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,831
Not personally, no.

273
00:23:02,124 --> 00:23:03,250
Me neither.

274
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:08,505
Are you really connected?

275
00:23:08,964 --> 00:23:11,007
I know guys. Guys know me.

276
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:15,929
I put money on the street, people know
to pay me back on time as a rule.

277
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:18,348
They call me "Frank, The Money Store."

278
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,058
You hear of me?

279
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:21,726
No.

280
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:24,938
I suppose that's good.

281
00:23:25,188 --> 00:23:29,359
But my therapist says I crave recognition
more than actual accomplishment.

282
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:31,987
Maybe that's why I do stand-up.

283
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:34,739
What the hell? I own the club.

284
00:23:38,535 --> 00:23:40,453
What do you think of my act?

285
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:45,959
I heard two Buddy Hackett jokes,
a Pat Cooper and a half a Lenny Bruce.

286
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:48,211
Another thing. You know, I was...

287
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:50,171
...watching you lash out at people.

288
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:52,382
Sometimes you should aimin.

289
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:55,343
Make a joke at your own expense.
Otherwiseit looks...

290
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:57,137
...kind of likeit...

291
00:23:57,595 --> 00:24:00,557
...comes off kind of hostile,
you know what I mean?

292
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,892
That's Phil fuckin' Donahue.

293
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,737
Let the body heat coming up
through your hand warm up the cognac.

294
00:24:14,946 --> 00:24:16,656
Giveit a little swirl.

295
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:20,660
All right, take a little sniff.

296
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:23,454
Nice, right?

297
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:26,457
Okay, take a sip. But holdit.

298
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:31,754
Don't gulpit. Just letit leak back
down your throat.

299
00:24:32,713 --> 00:24:34,882
-I know how to drink cognac.
-Okay.

300
00:24:35,383 --> 00:24:36,968
Hello. Not now.

301
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:40,137
Cheers.

302
00:24:50,648 --> 00:24:56,028
My wife thinks fucking and cooking
are two citiesin China.

303
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,614
I thought you said you weren't married.

304
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,453
-Where'd you hear that?
-I just made that up.

305
00:25:04,912 --> 00:25:07,415
-Bullshit.
-Go ahead, useit.

306
00:25:14,004 --> 00:25:16,131
Don't ever fuck with me.

307
00:25:16,841 --> 00:25:18,592
Don't ever lie to me...

308
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:22,346
...disrespect me, underestimate me.

309
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:25,724
If you do, your life becomes a raging sea.

310
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,271
But come to me like a man...

311
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:34,566
...with your eyes open, head up, hand out...

312
00:25:34,984 --> 00:25:38,487
...then I become more than a friend,
more than a shoulder.

313
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,698
I become the expediter of your dreams.

314
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,036
That's beautiful.

315
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:54,294
Get the hellin the car, Wayne.

316
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,171
Whatifit rains?

317
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:01,885
I wish I was a handsome man.

318
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,054
What?

319
00:26:04,888 --> 00:26:06,390
I wish I was brave.

320
00:26:06,473 --> 00:26:07,891
I wish I was....

321
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:09,810
I wish I had...

322
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:12,396
...real guts.

323
00:26:14,022 --> 00:26:16,983
Wayne, you wish you were a brave,
handsome man?

324
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,570
No offense,
but that sounds a littleimmature.

325
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:23,490
Sure, I wish a lot of things, but....

326
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:29,579
You don't know. Nobody....
You don't know.

327
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:33,375
You don't always talk
to other guys like this, do you?

328
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,043
What'd I say?

329
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,213
-Nothin'.
-What'd I say?

330
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,215
Nothin'.

331
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:50,016
You're really good, man.

332
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:02,112
I wish I was a real photographer.

333
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:06,574
I don't mean police work.
I don't mean weddings.

334
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,868
-I mean--
-You mean like an artist.

335
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,539
I get this feeling. Me and you...

336
00:27:12,622 --> 00:27:15,708
...we both wanna be someplace else.
Know what I mean?

337
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:17,543
Not me.

338
00:27:19,587 --> 00:27:21,798
Okay. Not you.

339
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,511
This guy looks like William Holden.

340
00:27:32,683 --> 00:27:35,561
I went to see this group show
with photographers...

341
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:38,064
...and I hit it off with a lady in the show.

342
00:27:38,147 --> 00:27:40,942
I met all her friends in the lofts and all.

343
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:44,278
Then I showed her my stuff,
and this guy says to me:

344
00:27:45,446 --> 00:27:47,615
"What do you think about being an artist?"

345
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:50,910
I said: "Yeah, sure, but the only thing is...

346
00:27:50,993 --> 00:27:54,956
"...there's no pension, there's no security,
there's no major medical."

347
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:59,418
Nobody laughed.

348
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:03,422
But as soon as I saidit, you know
what I thought? "I'm just a cop."

349
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:08,135
I'm a real civil servant.
That's the way I think, like a civil servant.

350
00:28:08,427 --> 00:28:11,389
But these people, they're artists.

351
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:13,766
They're special. They take chances.

352
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:16,644
Chances. You're a fuckin' policeman.

353
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:19,313
What kind of chances
do you think they're takin'?

354
00:28:19,396 --> 00:28:21,857
That the goddamn sushi might be tainted?

355
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:24,276
No! Look,it's different.

356
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:29,281
Look. Either you understand
what I'm sayin' or you don't.

357
00:28:29,573 --> 00:28:32,785
Are you mad at me? I'm on your side.

358
00:28:32,868 --> 00:28:35,037
No, look. Even she saidit.

359
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:39,625
My stuff comes out of the job.
The jobis the truth ofit.

360
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:41,460
The all ofit.

361
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,546
I don't create stuff. I find stuff.

362
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:50,677
Anyway, she was pretty nice aboutit.

363
00:28:51,678 --> 00:28:53,722
A nice person. I liked her.

364
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:58,101
-She was nice.
-She sounds like a bitch.

365
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:00,979
Hey, Frank. Bobby Gee.

366
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:03,815
Yeah, so I noticed.

367
00:29:04,816 --> 00:29:06,068
He looks good.

368
00:29:07,194 --> 00:29:08,904
If you know what I mean.

369
00:29:10,072 --> 00:29:11,823
Wayne, I'm gonna go home.

370
00:29:16,912 --> 00:29:18,121
Wait a second.

371
00:29:30,008 --> 00:29:31,176
My wife...

372
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:36,306
...they should cross her with a...

373
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:39,976
...Macintosh PC.

374
00:29:44,564 --> 00:29:46,191
Get a computer...

375
00:29:49,611 --> 00:29:51,321
...that never goes down.

376
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:58,703
Thisis good.

377
00:30:09,172 --> 00:30:10,757
That's a nasty burn.

378
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,717
I'll have someone take care ofit.

379
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,594
No,it doesn't even hurt.

380
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:19,307
Hey, the shooter?

381
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:22,393
I know who heis. The net's closing.

382
00:30:23,478 --> 00:30:25,146
"The net's closing"?

383
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:29,025
I like that. "The net's closing."

384
00:30:34,197 --> 00:30:36,449
I'm the expediter of your dreams, pal.

385
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:40,787
No, not me, brother. I'm flush.

386
00:30:40,953 --> 00:30:44,248
You're "flush"? "The net's closing"?

387
00:31:30,794 --> 00:31:32,379
-Hi?
-Yeah.

388
00:31:36,592 --> 00:31:38,010
My nameis Glory.

389
00:31:40,346 --> 00:31:43,432
I'm the one who spilled the coffee
on you last night?

390
00:31:45,142 --> 00:31:47,978
-Yeah, the bartender.
-Yeah.

391
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:53,275
Frank told me to come by and...

392
00:31:54,234 --> 00:31:56,028
...take care of your hand.

393
00:31:57,905 --> 00:32:01,450
Frank from last night?
He told you to do that?

394
00:32:04,161 --> 00:32:05,204
Can l...

395
00:32:06,872 --> 00:32:08,123
...your hand?

396
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,126
Thanks.

397
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:33,857
Thisis really stupid, I know.

398
00:32:33,982 --> 00:32:35,317
Whatever.

399
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:47,120
Thanks.

400
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:50,206
Frank wanted me to stay.

401
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:52,500
Here.

402
00:32:54,377 --> 00:32:57,422
Make sureit heals properly.
Change the bandage and all.

403
00:32:57,505 --> 00:32:58,715
Change the bandage?

404
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:01,843
Whatever. I'll run down,
get more ointment.

405
00:33:02,886 --> 00:33:05,847
Oh, yeah? How long did Frank....

406
00:33:06,848 --> 00:33:10,143
-How long did heimagine this would be?
-A week.

407
00:33:11,227 --> 00:33:12,687
Frank said a week.

408
00:33:14,189 --> 00:33:16,191
Look,it's not what you think.

409
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:18,735
It's not a sex thing.

410
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:20,904
Jesus.

411
00:33:36,294 --> 00:33:38,755
Just let me sit down. Please?

412
00:33:42,425 --> 00:33:43,843
How's the coffee?

413
00:33:44,594 --> 00:33:48,347
It's so rich. I can't believeit'sinstant.
How's your hand?

414
00:33:49,682 --> 00:33:50,725
Great.

415
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:55,104
You know I'm a cop, right?

416
00:33:57,148 --> 00:33:58,608
So I've been told.

417
00:34:00,568 --> 00:34:04,030
Anyways, I have to go to work now.

418
00:34:08,075 --> 00:34:10,244
So, I'll stay here?

419
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,247
Thisis my house, so....

420
00:34:13,706 --> 00:34:15,833
I'm not gonna steal anything.

421
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:18,002
Look, what's Frank's phone number?

422
00:34:18,085 --> 00:34:21,005
Talk to me before you talk to Frank, okay?

423
00:34:22,048 --> 00:34:25,843
Look, you saved his life.
He wants me to be your friend for a week.

424
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:27,636
That's all, I swear.

425
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:30,723
I'm like a thank-you present.

426
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:36,437
I'm like a seven-day singing telegram.
I'm like one of those people...

427
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,565
...that comes to your door
in a gorilla suit with balloons.

428
00:34:39,648 --> 00:34:43,777
Stop. Look, I gotta get outta here.

429
00:34:43,861 --> 00:34:48,115
I work straight through the night.
I come back at 6:00, 6:30, 7:00 a.m.

430
00:34:48,198 --> 00:34:49,491
No problem.

431
00:34:50,492 --> 00:34:52,953
-There's a TV.
-Great. Thanks.

432
00:34:55,998 --> 00:34:57,958
Refrigerator'sin the kitchen.

433
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:00,252
And outsideis downstairs.

434
00:35:01,336 --> 00:35:03,297
Yeah,if you have a key.

435
00:35:06,717 --> 00:35:08,886
Look, I'm really sorry about this.

436
00:35:11,138 --> 00:35:14,016
We'll straighten everything out
when I come back.

437
00:35:14,892 --> 00:35:16,059
Absolutely.

438
00:35:32,034 --> 00:35:33,952
Jimmy, come take a look at this.

439
00:35:34,661 --> 00:35:37,289
Over there right now.
Are you awake, fellas?

440
00:35:44,254 --> 00:35:46,381
The net of justice closesin.

441
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,010
Oh, Jesus.

442
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,179
That's my shooter.

443
00:35:59,477 --> 00:36:01,896
<i>-That was your fault, baby!
-My fault?</i>

444
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,648
<i>Why is it my fault?</i>

445
00:36:03,732 --> 00:36:06,526
<i>Because you are really
into pressing that red button!</i>

446
00:36:06,651 --> 00:36:08,987
<i>-No, I'm not.
-You like that shit, huh?</i>

447
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:12,699
<i>-l'm trying to make you something nice.
-Make me somethin' nice?</i>

448
00:36:12,782 --> 00:36:16,536
<i>-l'm sorry, okay?
-"Sorry" goddamn don't get it!</i>

449
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:20,582
<i>Sorry is for shits!
Sorry is what that fuckin' meal is!</i>

450
00:36:24,586 --> 00:36:27,463
I would have cleaned for you
but I couldn't find any dirt.

451
00:36:27,547 --> 00:36:31,009
-It's time to go. Come on, get up.
-Why? Hey!

452
00:36:31,175 --> 00:36:34,387
Why? Because you people
got me surrounded, that's why.

453
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,849
-So here's your bag. Come on.
-What are you talkin' about?

454
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:40,935
-Frank maybe killed somebody last night.
-Frank?

455
00:36:41,227 --> 00:36:44,355
If Frank wasinvolvedin something,
he's notinvolved.

456
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:47,483
-He's a million miles away.
-I'll tell you about "involved."

457
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:50,945
I buddy up to a guy one night,
he maybe kills someone the next.

458
00:36:51,028 --> 00:36:54,657
It comes out I got drunk with the shooter,
I got his girlin my house.

459
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,284
Thatisinvolved.

460
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:58,744
I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.

461
00:36:58,828 --> 00:37:00,788
Good-bye. Let's go. Come on.

462
00:37:00,872 --> 00:37:03,499
You don't understand!
There's a penalty system here.

463
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,042
For who? Me?

464
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:06,502
No, for me.

465
00:37:07,295 --> 00:37:09,797
You send me back, I'll beinto him forever.

466
00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:11,090
Why? You owe him?

467
00:37:11,382 --> 00:37:15,720
I don't know what happened last night.
I don't getinvolved with Frank's mess.

468
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:17,888
-But you owe him?
-It's complicated.

469
00:37:17,972 --> 00:37:20,182
Complicated? Complicated, like how?

470
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:22,226
Complicated, like how?

471
00:37:24,937 --> 00:37:28,733
Talk to me. Thisis my house.
Complicated, like how?

472
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:34,155
"If there's a cash-flow problem,
I'll takeitin trade." He ever say that?

473
00:37:34,238 --> 00:37:37,366
My brother had the cash-flow problem,
and I'm the trade.

474
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:40,202
I do what Frank wants
until my brother'sin the clear.

475
00:37:40,286 --> 00:37:43,122
You do whatever Frank wants like what?

476
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:47,626
He said to be your friend for a week.
You saved his life! That's all I know!

477
00:37:48,586 --> 00:37:50,963
You send me back,
he'll tell me I screwed up...

478
00:37:51,046 --> 00:37:52,965
...add two months, six months.

479
00:37:53,048 --> 00:37:55,884
With Frank, you can't argue.
You can't fight.

480
00:37:55,968 --> 00:37:57,219
You can't hide.

481
00:37:58,345 --> 00:38:00,264
So can you help me out here?

482
00:38:01,265 --> 00:38:02,558
Can I stay?

483
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:17,739
Why are you bangin' on my door?

484
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:20,367
You're makin' a lot of noise.
What's goin' on?

485
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,785
Are you the sheriff?

486
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:23,704
-I wanna see Lee.
-Fuck off.

487
00:38:23,787 --> 00:38:26,081
-You okay?
-I'll snapit off at the ankle.

488
00:38:26,164 --> 00:38:28,417
-It's okay.
-Are you sure?

489
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:30,544
Move your foot, shit bird.

490
00:38:31,044 --> 00:38:32,546
I'm a police officer.

491
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:36,049
Wayne, we were just arguingin here.
Everything's okay.

492
00:38:36,216 --> 00:38:38,593
-You're a police officer. Really?
-Yeah.

493
00:38:38,677 --> 00:38:40,178
Guess what?

494
00:38:44,015 --> 00:38:45,517
I'm on to you!

495
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,355
What can you do, you know?

496
00:38:50,856 --> 00:38:52,774
At least you gaveit a shot.

497
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,944
Yeah, you know, whatever.

498
00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:58,530
Do you want me to make you some tea?

499
00:38:59,197 --> 00:39:00,323
No, thanks.

500
00:39:08,832 --> 00:39:09,958
Frank.

501
00:39:10,959 --> 00:39:12,377
It's going great.

502
00:39:14,379 --> 00:39:15,964
Frank, I swear.

503
00:39:17,132 --> 00:39:20,218
We haven't stopped laughing
since I camein the door.

504
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:22,095
He's tickled pink.

505
00:39:25,348 --> 00:39:28,434
No, he can't come to the phone right now.
He's out.

506
00:39:29,394 --> 00:39:30,436
At work.

507
00:39:33,106 --> 00:39:35,358
Frank, that's none of your business.

508
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,571
I have to.... I'll call you back.

509
00:39:40,405 --> 00:39:41,864
Gotta go. Phone's ringing.

510
00:39:41,948 --> 00:39:43,825
The other phone, okay?

511
00:39:44,826 --> 00:39:46,369
Hi. Did I wake you?

512
00:39:47,286 --> 00:39:49,664
No.

513
00:40:08,933 --> 00:40:11,227
So, you gave walking toursin school?

514
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,355
-What'd you study, history, real estate?
-Acting.

515
00:40:14,897 --> 00:40:16,857
Like everybody and his cousin.

516
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:19,694
I gave tours to make the rent, but then...

517
00:40:19,777 --> 00:40:22,446
...l gotinto tending bar
becauseit paid better.

518
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:25,658
Opened up my days
for more classes, auditions.

519
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:30,496
You ask a bartender or waiter
around here: "What do you do?"

520
00:40:30,788 --> 00:40:35,334
They say: "I'm an actor," "I'm a singer,"
"I'm a student," "I'm a writer."

521
00:40:35,418 --> 00:40:38,587
After a couple of years,
you have to be honest with yourself.

522
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:41,048
I'm a bartender, waiter...

523
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:42,675
...waitress.

524
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:47,596
Lifeis what happens to you while
you're waitin' for your ship to comein.

525
00:40:47,888 --> 00:40:49,348
Cops are luckyin that way.

526
00:40:49,431 --> 00:40:51,809
It's hard confusing a cop
with anything else.

527
00:40:51,892 --> 00:40:53,978
I mean, a cop's a cop. The end.

528
00:40:56,105 --> 00:40:58,565
I was working as a bartender
in a club Frank owned.

529
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:01,402
I knew Frank put money on the street.

530
00:41:02,403 --> 00:41:04,905
So I put my brother together with Frank.

531
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:10,327
Going to Frankis like taking heroin
to cure an alcohol problem, you know?

532
00:41:11,954 --> 00:41:15,707
My brother can't make his payments.
Frank starts taking over.

533
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:18,961
He fires everybody, putsin his own people.

534
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:21,046
He orders through the corporation.

535
00:41:21,129 --> 00:41:23,382
Steaks, liquor, kitchen equipment.

536
00:41:23,465 --> 00:41:26,760
All to re-sell on his own
'cause he's a silent partner, right?

537
00:41:26,843 --> 00:41:28,554
He's not liable anyhow.

538
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:32,808
Next thing I know,
my brother slit his wrists...

539
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:35,644
...and his wife's ready
to run away with his kids.

540
00:41:35,936 --> 00:41:38,814
So I go to Frank and say:
"Leave my brother alone.

541
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,816
"I'll do anything you want."

542
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:43,902
Anyways...

543
00:41:44,444 --> 00:41:46,363
...my brother's a waiter now.

544
00:41:47,406 --> 00:41:49,825
At least he's alive and sort ofintact.

545
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:53,995
-So what do you do for him?
-This, that, the other.

546
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,455
Like what?

547
00:42:01,837 --> 00:42:03,797
What's the difference?

548
00:42:05,215 --> 00:42:07,467
-Okay, here you are.
-Thank you.

549
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:16,017
Could you smile a little?
Hold my hand or something?

550
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:31,032
-Go home.
-Home?

551
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:34,160
Just take the keys, and I'll be there soon.

552
00:42:56,015 --> 00:42:58,976
Listen, I'm a cop,
and I don't like to be followed...

553
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,312
...and I don't like her bein' followed.

554
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,774
Frank just wants to make sure
that you're happy.

555
00:43:04,857 --> 00:43:06,067
Are you happy?

556
00:43:10,404 --> 00:43:12,031
I get paid either way.

557
00:43:18,871 --> 00:43:19,830
Tom.

558
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:23,251
I said go home.

559
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,586
I wanted to wait for you.

560
00:43:27,129 --> 00:43:28,297
Okay, let's go.

561
00:43:28,381 --> 00:43:30,424
-Can I tell you something?
-I gotta go.

562
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:32,009
Give me five minutes.

563
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,930
Go ahead. I'll be there.

564
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:47,983
They found the gun that did your shooter.

565
00:43:48,067 --> 00:43:50,444
-Where?
-On some other dead mutt.

566
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:54,907
Bullshit. He got taken out by Frank Milo.
He probably did this guy, too.

567
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:58,118
Left the gun with the body
soit looks like a solve.

568
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,162
It's a solve and nobody gives a shit.

569
00:44:00,246 --> 00:44:03,707
Two dead muttsin Muttland.
5:00. Time to go home.

570
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:05,584
It's a plant.

571
00:44:09,004 --> 00:44:10,381
Who was the babe?

572
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:13,300
A friend.

573
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:15,052
Yeah?

574
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,184
What happened to the girl next door? Lee.

575
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:28,982
She's a nice lady.
This one's a little too fast for you, no?

576
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:35,405
-You okay? What's the matter?
-Nothin'.

577
00:44:41,703 --> 00:44:43,455
Hey, that's the one.

578
00:44:43,789 --> 00:44:45,582
Jesus, look at that shiner.

579
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,628
<i>Looks like that dog on The Little Rascals.
Who wasit, Petey?</i>

580
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:51,671
She's getting smacked around.

581
00:44:54,299 --> 00:44:55,342
By him?

582
00:44:55,467 --> 00:44:58,053
I had a talk with him. The guy's on the job.

583
00:44:58,136 --> 00:45:01,515
He's on the job? So fuckin' what?
You had a talk with him?

584
00:45:02,474 --> 00:45:03,350
And?

585
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,143
He's an asshole.

586
00:45:11,399 --> 00:45:12,442
Oh, yeah?

587
00:45:15,237 --> 00:45:16,696
Hold this, please.

588
00:45:28,249 --> 00:45:31,002
How're you doin', Sis? Thisis my sister.

589
00:45:32,128 --> 00:45:33,505
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

590
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:36,424
What, did you walkinto a door, Sis?

591
00:45:36,966 --> 00:45:38,676
Did she walkinto a door?

592
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:42,305
-You're not fuckin' hittin' her, are you?
-It's okay.

593
00:45:42,388 --> 00:45:45,683
-Whatis your fucking problem?
-Tommy, I need your towel.

594
00:45:47,852 --> 00:45:51,856
Slip your piece under the towel.
Tommy will holdit for you till after.

595
00:45:53,399 --> 00:45:54,817
Come on, you fuckin' hump.

596
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:57,945
Come on, you hero.
I want a taste of you. Let's go.

597
00:45:58,404 --> 00:46:00,114
I got no beef with you.

598
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,867
Slip your piece under the towel.

599
00:46:03,659 --> 00:46:05,370
I got no beef with you.

600
00:46:08,748 --> 00:46:11,084
Are you sweet? ls that your problem?

601
00:46:17,673 --> 00:46:20,843
-Come on, I'm on the job.
-You ain't on my fuckin' job.

602
00:46:25,348 --> 00:46:26,557
Hey, come on.

603
00:46:27,558 --> 00:46:32,104
You lost her address, her phone number.
Can't even remember what she looks like.

604
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:33,481
Right?

605
00:46:36,734 --> 00:46:38,736
-Yeah, right.
-What's her name?

606
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,821
I don't know, okay?

607
00:46:42,198 --> 00:46:44,617
Don't even turn around to say good-bye.

608
00:46:57,004 --> 00:47:00,466
Hey. Chivas and milk.
I never forget a neck.

609
00:47:02,468 --> 00:47:05,012
You should try that shit
with me sometime.

610
00:47:05,262 --> 00:47:08,599
Yeah? Different strokes for different folks.

611
00:47:29,578 --> 00:47:31,538
No guts, no glory, right?

612
00:47:39,963 --> 00:47:43,008
-Smoke, smoke.
-What?

613
00:47:43,175 --> 00:47:44,718
You mean pot, crack?

614
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:47,387
Get smart with me
and I'll bust a capin your ass.

615
00:47:47,471 --> 00:47:49,348
You wanna do Dodge City with me?

616
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:52,267
-You crazy?
-Crazy? I'm a fuckin' mad dog!

617
00:47:57,355 --> 00:47:58,482
Oh, Jesus.

618
00:48:26,885 --> 00:48:30,513
<i>Frank, you're making him strong again.</i>

619
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:38,480
-Where were you?
-What do you do for him?

620
00:48:38,938 --> 00:48:40,440
-Who, Frank?
-Frank.

621
00:48:41,274 --> 00:48:43,735
-I tend bar.
-Tend bar. What else?

622
00:48:43,818 --> 00:48:45,403
-Deliver things.
-What things?

623
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:48,031
-Some pretty weird shit.
-Like what?

624
00:48:49,282 --> 00:48:52,619
Once I took this box up to a guyin Detroit.

625
00:48:52,994 --> 00:48:56,706
I took the Greyhound. So I'm sitting
on the bus six hours, wondering.

626
00:48:56,789 --> 00:48:59,000
I gointo the bathroomin the back.

627
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,336
I open the box, lookinside.

628
00:49:01,836 --> 00:49:05,715
There was a human handin there
with manicured nails and a wedding band.

629
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:07,050
I almost died.

630
00:49:07,884 --> 00:49:09,302
I get up to Detroit.

631
00:49:09,385 --> 00:49:12,221
I deliverit to a guyin a bowling alley.

632
00:49:12,305 --> 00:49:15,349
This guy, he opens the box, looksinside...

633
00:49:15,975 --> 00:49:19,061
...and he gives me a tip
like I was delivering take-out.

634
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,689
-You sleep with him?
-With Frank?

635
00:49:23,024 --> 00:49:26,652
-I don't think he has sex.
-He make you sleep with anybody else?

636
00:49:27,153 --> 00:49:28,196
No.

637
00:49:29,697 --> 00:49:31,407
He's got girls for that.

638
00:49:31,532 --> 00:49:34,118
"The Frank Milo Dancers," he calls them.

639
00:49:34,577 --> 00:49:37,204
So you never had to sleep
with anybody else.

640
00:49:41,459 --> 00:49:44,045
One time, the guy from the bowling alley...

641
00:49:44,128 --> 00:49:46,547
...he cameinto town, asked for me, and...

642
00:49:46,881 --> 00:49:50,843
...Frank said I had to go out with him,
but what happened was up to me.

643
00:49:50,926 --> 00:49:54,597
What happened was he was a lot
physically stronger than me, so....

644
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:57,141
I survived.

645
00:49:58,517 --> 00:50:01,145
Oh, Jesus. She survived.

646
00:50:06,233 --> 00:50:09,111
What about me? Whatif I get horny?

647
00:50:09,194 --> 00:50:10,988
You're a thank-you present, right?

648
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:14,033
Whyis the worst a guy canimagine
happening to a woman...

649
00:50:14,116 --> 00:50:15,743
...is she fucks another guy?

650
00:50:15,826 --> 00:50:17,995
That's not what I'm drivin' at.

651
00:50:18,078 --> 00:50:20,873
-What are you drivin' at?
-I don't know. So there.

652
00:50:20,956 --> 00:50:24,793
I do what I can for people,
but I'm no warrior, I'm no hero. Sorry.

653
00:50:26,336 --> 00:50:28,630
I'm not asking you to save me, Wayne.

654
00:50:30,632 --> 00:50:32,676
So, you need to be saved, right?

655
00:50:33,427 --> 00:50:35,804
Tell me. You need to be saved, right?

656
00:50:37,055 --> 00:50:41,810
For the next five days, let's just pretend
we're your basic, normal couple.

657
00:50:41,894 --> 00:50:43,604
-Normal.
-Watch TV.

658
00:50:43,687 --> 00:50:44,938
TV. Right.

659
00:50:47,733 --> 00:50:50,652
<i>Frank! Stop it! Stop the machine!</i>

660
00:50:51,236 --> 00:50:52,946
<i>Don't pull that switch!</i>

661
00:51:07,252 --> 00:51:09,671
Could you put your arm around me?

662
00:51:14,885 --> 00:51:18,221
<i>-Where's Varsdic?
-He said he'd blow up the dam.</i>

663
00:53:06,412 --> 00:53:08,622
If you don't wanna do anything,
that's okay.

664
00:53:08,706 --> 00:53:10,166
I'll go with that.

665
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:14,837
-Okay, I don't wanna do anything.
-Good. That's okay.

666
00:53:17,298 --> 00:53:19,133
You're a sweet man, you know that?

667
00:53:19,216 --> 00:53:21,719
No kiddin'. If you don't wanna doit...

668
00:53:21,885 --> 00:53:23,095
...it's okay.

669
00:53:33,564 --> 00:53:34,815
Open your lips.

670
00:53:35,941 --> 00:53:37,443
I know how to kiss.

671
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,831
You know, I should do some sit-ups.

672
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,293
-Right now?
-No, I meanin general.

673
00:54:03,885 --> 00:54:06,805
Are you my hero? Are you my man?

674
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,115
You're a sweet man.

675
00:54:28,243 --> 00:54:30,787
-Watch out for next time.
-Fair enough.

676
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,624
I haven't made lovein two years.

677
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:36,835
"Made love." I like that.

678
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:40,130
You talk like someone
out of the Round Table days.

679
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:42,590
Sir Lancelot.

680
00:54:44,009 --> 00:54:45,343
Galahad.

681
00:54:53,893 --> 00:54:55,979
The thing about photographing death...

682
00:54:56,062 --> 00:54:58,106
...there's no dignityin death.

683
00:54:58,314 --> 00:55:00,191
The body can't defenditself.

684
00:55:00,275 --> 00:55:02,277
Can't pullits skirt down.

685
00:55:03,862 --> 00:55:05,488
Can't closeits mouth.

686
00:55:05,989 --> 00:55:09,492
Cops are walkin' around the crime scene,
everything's a joke.

687
00:55:10,535 --> 00:55:14,580
What you're photographing on the job
is the worst kind of helplessness.

688
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:17,959
You know why I became a cop?

689
00:55:18,376 --> 00:55:22,422
My father, his whole life,
was a sales clerkin a hat store.

690
00:55:22,964 --> 00:55:27,260
A realinvisible man. Spent his whole life
takin' shit from people.

691
00:55:27,885 --> 00:55:29,679
I was afraid I'd end up like him.

692
00:55:29,762 --> 00:55:31,931
I panicked and became a policeman.

693
00:55:32,014 --> 00:55:34,475
Kinda overreacted, you know?

694
00:55:37,812 --> 00:55:39,188
It's so quiet.

695
00:55:41,315 --> 00:55:43,484
I can't believe I'm here with you.

696
00:55:44,068 --> 00:55:48,364
One time, about 3:00 a.m.,
I was right here lookin' down this street.

697
00:55:48,447 --> 00:55:52,159
I'm lookin' right down, swear to God.
You know what I see?

698
00:55:52,785 --> 00:55:56,998
A goddamn deeris standing there
at thatintersection down there.

699
00:55:57,748 --> 00:56:00,418
I couldn't believeit.
I almost had a heart attack.

700
00:56:00,501 --> 00:56:02,211
I don't know whereit came from.

701
00:56:02,294 --> 00:56:05,047
Maybeit swam from lndiana,
escaped from the zoo...

702
00:56:05,131 --> 00:56:06,841
...but thereit was, this deer.

703
00:56:06,924 --> 00:56:09,552
Me and this deer at 3:00 a.m.

704
00:56:12,972 --> 00:56:15,391
Let me show you that photo of the deer.

705
00:56:18,102 --> 00:56:21,230
-Would you photograph me?
-No, you don't want that.

706
00:56:21,313 --> 00:56:24,024
With the people I photograph
it would be bad luck.

707
00:56:24,108 --> 00:56:26,694
-Come on.
-No way. Sorry.

708
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:37,496
-Come on.
-No,it would freak me out.

709
00:56:40,457 --> 00:56:42,376
Where the hell did I putit?

710
00:56:46,171 --> 00:56:47,131
Wayne.

711
00:59:28,415 --> 00:59:29,917
All right.

712
00:59:34,546 --> 00:59:36,173
Smile for the birdie.

713
00:59:41,887 --> 00:59:42,930
Do me.

714
01:00:41,446 --> 01:00:44,074
It's so weird,
you wearing a gun to work every day.

715
01:00:44,157 --> 01:00:47,285
-I keep forgetting, you know.
-Hey, no guts, no glory.

716
01:01:09,224 --> 01:01:11,142
You see? I told you, Wayne.

717
01:01:11,309 --> 01:01:12,936
This food can kill you.

718
01:01:13,061 --> 01:01:15,271
Waiter says guy walksin, comes up...

719
01:01:15,355 --> 01:01:18,066
...bop, bop, back of the head,
walks right out.

720
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:22,612
Gangland, USA. Gino Coraldi
was sitting down to some calamari.

721
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:26,866
He'd just stolen the account books
of Alphonse "The Wolf" Lupo.

722
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:29,702
He felt like celebrating.

723
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,553
Louis Prima! The best!

724
01:02:38,062 --> 01:02:41,190
What do you thinkis the motive here?

725
01:02:41,273 --> 01:02:45,027
"When the end comes I know
they'll say just a gigolo

726
01:02:45,611 --> 01:02:48,614
"Life goes on without me 'cause

727
01:02:49,281 --> 01:02:54,828
"I ain't got nobody"

728
01:02:55,496 --> 01:02:57,331
Did you get laid last night?

729
01:02:57,414 --> 01:03:00,292
I don't get laid. I make love.

730
01:03:03,462 --> 01:03:04,588
Thank you.

731
01:03:09,468 --> 01:03:10,719
Hi, White.

732
01:03:11,136 --> 01:03:13,388
-Hey, Mike.
-I swear to God,it's true.

733
01:03:13,555 --> 01:03:15,223
Then my friend, Phil.

734
01:03:16,141 --> 01:03:18,101
He applies to the police department.

735
01:03:18,185 --> 01:03:21,355
Interviewer says: "Mr. Scarangelo,
what's your height?"

736
01:03:22,189 --> 01:03:25,317
Philly reads off his palm:
"Six foot, threeinches."

737
01:03:25,901 --> 01:03:27,944
Guy says: "What's your weight?"

738
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,113
"203 pounds."

739
01:03:31,156 --> 01:03:33,992
Guy says: "And can you tell me
your first name?"

740
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:35,452
Philly goes:

741
01:03:37,829 --> 01:03:39,039
"Philly."

742
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:43,793
Theinterviewer says: "What was that
you did with your head like that?"

743
01:03:43,877 --> 01:03:45,128
Philly goes:

744
01:03:45,503 --> 01:03:48,214
"Happy birthday to you"

745
01:03:50,383 --> 01:03:51,676
That's nothin'.

746
01:03:52,677 --> 01:03:54,054
I said to my wife:

747
01:03:54,137 --> 01:03:57,057
"Did you ever hear of cleaning, cooking?"

748
01:03:58,099 --> 01:04:00,685
She says: "Two citiesin China?"

749
01:04:03,605 --> 01:04:05,356
My wife said this!

750
01:04:09,611 --> 01:04:12,405
Hey! There heis!

751
01:04:12,864 --> 01:04:14,157
I just come by.

752
01:04:15,742 --> 01:04:17,368
I wentin on a bakery.

753
01:04:17,744 --> 01:04:19,954
Pineapple-sour cream.

754
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:33,676
Eat.

755
01:04:36,012 --> 01:04:38,556
-You look drawn.
-What are you doing here?

756
01:04:40,224 --> 01:04:43,978
I don't know. Harold said
you didn't seem so happy the other day.

757
01:04:44,729 --> 01:04:48,274
I wasin the neighborhood,
so I thought I'd checkin with you.

758
01:04:52,445 --> 01:04:53,905
So how'sit goin'?

759
01:04:56,282 --> 01:04:58,993
-How's that burn on your hand?
-Doing fine.

760
01:05:00,995 --> 01:05:03,205
-Nice-nice?
-Fine.

761
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,042
The gift that keeps on givin'.

762
01:05:08,794 --> 01:05:10,212
What's wrong?

763
01:05:13,382 --> 01:05:14,550
Wayne.

764
01:05:17,011 --> 01:05:19,388
She's yankin' your chain, right?

765
01:05:20,848 --> 01:05:22,558
Messin' with your head?

766
01:05:22,933 --> 01:05:24,351
Sure. Look at you.

767
01:05:26,228 --> 01:05:27,980
Givin' you sob stories, I bet.

768
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:30,316
I don't know what you're talking about.

769
01:05:30,399 --> 01:05:32,693
Then quit givin' me that look, Ma.

770
01:05:33,068 --> 01:05:34,528
I'm your sonny boy.

771
01:05:35,571 --> 01:05:37,281
Want me to sing for you?

772
01:05:40,826 --> 01:05:41,869
May l?

773
01:05:45,289 --> 01:05:46,415
I gotta go.

774
01:05:51,587 --> 01:05:54,840
I'm doing Comic-Cazie tomorrow.
You should come.

775
01:05:58,677 --> 01:06:01,263
Unless you're busy.

776
01:06:01,847 --> 01:06:03,891
What the fuckis he doin' here?

777
01:06:04,516 --> 01:06:05,601
I don't know.

778
01:06:05,684 --> 01:06:09,396
-That's the guy I told you about.
-Fuck you. And who are you?

779
01:06:10,105 --> 01:06:11,481
Thisis Frank.

780
01:06:12,608 --> 01:06:13,775
Frank Milo?

781
01:06:16,278 --> 01:06:17,779
You've heard of me?

782
01:06:20,073 --> 01:06:21,116
Yeah.

783
01:06:22,284 --> 01:06:26,538
Wayne says you killed that mutt we found
in the garbage can the other night.

784
01:06:29,499 --> 01:06:31,793
I thought you'd heard of mein the clubs.

785
01:06:31,877 --> 01:06:33,420
You know, comic circles.

786
01:06:33,503 --> 01:06:35,922
No, just scumbag circles. Sorry.

787
01:06:37,966 --> 01:06:39,384
Jesus Christ.

788
01:06:40,677 --> 01:06:42,804
Wayne,is this what's troublin' you?

789
01:06:42,888 --> 01:06:45,140
I'm kinda jammed up here, Frank.

790
01:06:47,517 --> 01:06:49,311
I thought we were friends.

791
01:06:49,978 --> 01:06:51,021
No.

792
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:54,900
Two guys who wished
they were someplace else.

793
01:06:59,154 --> 01:07:00,196
Whatever.

794
01:07:02,282 --> 01:07:04,075
All right, I'll come by...

795
01:07:04,993 --> 01:07:07,162
...let's see, tonight's Thursday.

796
01:07:08,997 --> 01:07:11,166
I'll come by, pick her up Monday.

797
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:13,752
Okay? Monday morning.

798
01:07:18,465 --> 01:07:19,632
See you, Ma.

799
01:07:24,304 --> 01:07:26,181
Andincidentally...

800
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:30,935
...l don't know what you're talkin' about.
A guyin a garbage pail, but...

801
01:07:31,269 --> 01:07:34,355
...most of the people I know
who don't diein bed...

802
01:07:35,773 --> 01:07:38,276
...they usually wind up killing themselves.

803
01:07:57,128 --> 01:07:58,921
Pick who up Monday?

804
01:07:59,005 --> 01:08:00,298
What's up, man?

805
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,093
I don't know.

806
01:08:17,898 --> 01:08:18,941
Hello?

807
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:21,235
What are you trying to pull now?

808
01:08:21,485 --> 01:08:22,695
Frank, hi.

809
01:08:23,154 --> 01:08:25,322
I want you out of there by Monday.

810
01:08:25,823 --> 01:08:27,616
No more head trips on this chump...

811
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:30,202
...or you will be the one with the problem.

812
01:08:31,078 --> 01:08:32,872
He's not a chump, okay?

813
01:08:33,247 --> 01:08:35,916
I told you I was doin' you
a big favor with this.

814
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,544
I hateit when people
take advantage of my favors.

815
01:08:38,627 --> 01:08:41,046
Taking advantage? Come on, Frank.

816
01:08:41,422 --> 01:08:44,091
<i>And then I'm gonna do you
one more big favor.</i>

817
01:08:44,633 --> 01:08:47,553
And this'll be about the last thing
you do for me.

818
01:08:47,845 --> 01:08:50,848
It's for a friend of a friend from Detroit.

819
01:08:51,849 --> 01:08:53,100
Thanks, Frank.

820
01:08:56,812 --> 01:08:59,481
I'll be there.

821
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:04,403
Whatever happensis up to me.
Where have I heard that before?

822
01:09:05,738 --> 01:09:06,864
I'm not....

823
01:09:08,115 --> 01:09:09,825
I'm not giving you lip.

824
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:14,163
I'm sorry.

825
01:09:16,331 --> 01:09:18,500
When have I not been good company?

826
01:09:24,298 --> 01:09:25,340
Hi.

827
01:09:27,259 --> 01:09:29,928

from Detroit comin' up?

828
01:09:30,178 --> 01:09:31,888
It's not till next week.

829
01:09:33,348 --> 01:09:36,059
We still have three fun-filled days
and nights here.

830
01:09:36,143 --> 01:09:38,228
Let's make the most ofit, okay?

831
01:09:55,912 --> 01:09:57,873
You're not goin' back to him.

832
01:09:59,541 --> 01:10:01,459
It's not the end of the world.

833
01:10:01,543 --> 01:10:02,752
Yeah,itis.

834
01:10:04,421 --> 01:10:05,588
I love you.

835
01:10:12,595 --> 01:10:14,681
There's nothing you can do aboutit.

836
01:10:14,764 --> 01:10:17,475
-What can you do aboutit?
-I said I love you.

837
01:11:00,184 --> 01:11:02,353
I don't want another one of those.

838
01:11:03,062 --> 01:11:04,605
It wasn't her fault.

839
01:11:05,064 --> 01:11:08,401
Hey. Your pal, what's his name, Frank?

840
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:12,405
He sentit over.
I saved two piecesin the fridge for you.

841
01:11:12,822 --> 01:11:14,407
Yeah, whatis he, a baker?

842
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:16,617
He's killin' me with this crap.

843
01:11:26,085 --> 01:11:27,128
Jesus!

844
01:11:42,059 --> 01:11:44,562
Are you doing anything urgent on Monday?

845
01:11:47,231 --> 01:11:48,440
What time?

846
01:11:53,404 --> 01:11:57,199
"One floor below me. You don't even
know me. I love you

847
01:12:00,953 --> 01:12:03,580
"On the ceilingif you want me

848
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:08,669
"If the answeris no

849
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:16,802
"Means you'll meet mein the hallway

850
01:12:17,761 --> 01:12:19,471
"Twice on the pipe

851
01:12:20,138 --> 01:12:22,641
"Means you ain't gonna show"

852
01:12:24,142 --> 01:12:27,563
Occifer, what's the word?

853
01:12:28,522 --> 01:12:29,773
Nothin' much.

854
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,817
She comin' down?

855
01:12:32,317 --> 01:12:35,028
Where's she gonna fit?
Looks like a full boat.

856
01:12:35,821 --> 01:12:37,447
She can sit on my lap.

857
01:12:40,033 --> 01:12:41,368
She comin' down?

858
01:12:50,043 --> 01:12:53,839
You wouldn't believe what happened
this week. It's crazy, man.

859
01:12:54,256 --> 01:12:55,632
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

860
01:12:57,968 --> 01:12:59,719
Listen, I'm serious.

861
01:13:00,387 --> 01:13:01,972
We'rein love.

862
01:13:03,265 --> 01:13:06,184
And I think we're gonna live together.

863
01:13:06,685 --> 01:13:08,895
Maybe even get married. Who knows?

864
01:13:13,149 --> 01:13:16,319
I'm serious. I swear to God.

865
01:13:16,736 --> 01:13:18,363
That's life, you know?

866
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:21,866
"That's life." Fuckin' Wayne.

867
01:13:22,409 --> 01:13:25,036
You give him a hand,
he takes the whole arm.

868
01:13:29,124 --> 01:13:30,750
Bring her down, Wayne.

869
01:13:33,753 --> 01:13:34,963
I love her.

870
01:13:35,964 --> 01:13:37,215
You love her.

871
01:13:38,424 --> 01:13:39,676
I own her!

872
01:13:49,352 --> 01:13:51,020
I knewit, I knewit!

873
01:13:51,646 --> 01:13:55,274
Didn't I callit right on the nose
when I saw youin the office?

874
01:13:55,483 --> 01:13:59,862
You're a schmuckif you don't think
she's playing you like a violin right now.

875
01:14:10,248 --> 01:14:11,290
Women.

876
01:14:13,584 --> 01:14:17,046
Fuckin' women. You can't live with 'em.
You can't kill 'em.

877
01:14:20,633 --> 01:14:22,343
Okay,if you want...

878
01:14:23,344 --> 01:14:25,054
...you can assume the debt.

879
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:27,932
-Assume the debt?
-Yeah.

880
01:14:29,058 --> 01:14:30,434
Be my friend.

881
01:14:31,018 --> 01:14:33,688
For what, I don't exactly know.
You're a cop.

882
01:14:33,813 --> 01:14:35,856
Maybe somethin', maybe nothin'.

883
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:39,652
You want me to forget about her,
for the next year...

884
01:14:39,735 --> 01:14:42,446
...if I call you,
you have to pick up the phone.

885
01:14:43,155 --> 01:14:44,740
That I can live with.

886
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:55,668
-I can't do that.
-Then send her down.

887
01:14:58,796 --> 01:15:00,506
I can't do that either.

888
01:15:09,139 --> 01:15:10,182
Harold.

889
01:15:25,405 --> 01:15:27,491
-Hello.
-How're you doin'?

890
01:15:28,492 --> 01:15:30,035
Good. And you?

891
01:15:31,245 --> 01:15:32,371
I'm good.

892
01:15:43,173 --> 01:15:44,424
Are you heeled?

893
01:16:14,454 --> 01:16:18,291
Did they ever catch the guy
who did the shitheadin the garbage can?

894
01:16:22,253 --> 01:16:24,422
"She don't love you

895
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:28,176
"Like I love you"

896
01:16:42,065 --> 01:16:44,400
Watch the glass door, asshole!

897
01:16:51,783 --> 01:16:53,409
Who's up there, Wayne?

898
01:16:56,496 --> 01:16:57,914
I love her.

899
01:16:58,748 --> 01:17:00,124
Jesus Christ.

900
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:02,919
Come on. Let's go see.

901
01:17:23,356 --> 01:17:26,651
You always get someone else
to fight your fights for you?

902
01:17:30,821 --> 01:17:33,449
Who am I to talk, right? You okay, Harold?

903
01:17:44,877 --> 01:17:48,255
Since wild horses couldn't get you
to tell me where sheis....

904
01:17:48,339 --> 01:17:49,924
Stop meif I'm wrong.

905
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:52,218
Thisis the best I can do for you.

906
01:17:53,677 --> 01:17:56,222
Now, the cash value
of her services to me...

907
01:17:56,889 --> 01:17:58,682
...projected over one year...

908
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:01,018
...would be 70...

909
01:18:02,269 --> 01:18:03,771
...$75,000.

910
01:18:04,563 --> 01:18:06,023
You wanna buy her?

911
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:07,441
$75,000?

912
01:18:11,195 --> 01:18:14,156
The Money Storeis gonna run
a founder's day sale.

913
01:18:14,948 --> 01:18:15,991
$50,000.

914
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:19,745
No. You saved my life.

915
01:18:20,579 --> 01:18:21,997
You can have her...

916
01:18:22,498 --> 01:18:23,749
...for $40,000.

917
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:25,292
$40,000?

918
01:18:26,794 --> 01:18:29,630
If you don't haveit,
you can borrowit from me.

919
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:33,300
You can pay me back
with a personal services contract.

920
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:35,886
Fuck you.

921
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:38,889
Fuck me? Okay.

922
01:18:39,598 --> 01:18:41,058
Fuck me then.

923
01:18:41,934 --> 01:18:44,895
Go to your credit union, go to your bank...

924
01:18:44,978 --> 01:18:47,564
...go to Household Finance,
go to your mother.

925
01:18:48,273 --> 01:18:49,775
You got three days.

926
01:18:49,983 --> 01:18:52,819
I want $40,000, or I want Glory.

927
01:18:53,236 --> 01:18:55,489
This shit today, Wayne?

928
01:18:56,156 --> 01:18:58,116
<i>This was fuckin' Romper Room.</i>

929
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,579
You like baseball?

930
01:19:03,413 --> 01:19:07,000
You get this straight with me,
I'll take you to some Sox games.

931
01:19:07,083 --> 01:19:08,668
I got a season's box.

932
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:12,088
$40,000in three, chief.

933
01:19:16,593 --> 01:19:17,928
That guy bites.

934
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:29,814
-It's over.
-Wait a minute.

935
01:19:30,357 --> 01:19:32,859
-He backed off?
-He's history.

936
01:19:33,443 --> 01:19:35,445
I owe you one. I owe you ten.

937
01:19:36,488 --> 01:19:39,616
-What the hell's goin' on?
-Nothin'. It's complicated.

938
01:19:40,325 --> 01:19:41,910
Welcome to the world.

939
01:19:45,121 --> 01:19:48,291
Mike, he's a businessman.
He wants to stayin business.

940
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:51,836
He's fightin' with cops.
There's no percentagein that.

941
01:19:52,295 --> 01:19:53,421
That'sit.

942
01:19:53,963 --> 01:19:55,256
Thanks, man.

943
01:20:02,096 --> 01:20:03,931
So, I'm really out of here?

944
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,850
Out of here?

945
01:20:06,559 --> 01:20:09,187
You know what I mean. Am I free?

946
01:20:09,854 --> 01:20:11,939
I can hop on a plane and vanish?

947
01:20:12,231 --> 01:20:14,317
If that's what you wanted to do.

948
01:20:14,859 --> 01:20:17,570
No, I'm just sayin'. Hypothetically.

949
01:20:18,029 --> 01:20:22,825
In a few days you can go to the moon and
take cooking classes, for all Frank cares.

950
01:20:22,909 --> 01:20:25,620
In a few days? Why not now?

951
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:30,833
He asked me to ask you
to sit tight a few days...

952
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:33,878
-...so he can take care of loose ends.
-Loose ends?

953
01:20:35,838 --> 01:20:39,925
You know, he said he had to get coverage
for that guy from Detroit.

954
01:20:57,443 --> 01:21:00,738
It's a steal. The guy said $40,000
on his desk by Wednesday.

955
01:21:00,821 --> 01:21:03,240
He'll sell for $65,000
with a personal mortgage...

956
01:21:03,324 --> 01:21:04,950
...between us for the rest.

957
01:21:05,034 --> 01:21:08,287
The guy's desperate. The house
must be worth at least $100,000.

958
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:10,205
I just have to make the $40,000.

959
01:21:10,956 --> 01:21:11,999
Lake Zurich.

960
01:21:12,082 --> 01:21:15,586
-What the hell you gonna do up there?
-Nothing. I'll flipit.

961
01:21:15,669 --> 01:21:18,797
Lend me $5,000,
I'll give you back $7,000 when I flipit.

962
01:21:20,174 --> 01:21:21,884
I don't haveit.

963
01:21:31,894 --> 01:21:34,396
Don't you even wanna know whatit's for?

964
01:21:35,022 --> 01:21:36,106
No.

965
01:21:36,607 --> 01:21:39,484
It's for this real dream house
upin Lake Zurich.

966
01:21:42,196 --> 01:21:44,531
How much does he want for her?

967
01:21:48,285 --> 01:21:49,661
More than I got.

968
01:21:50,746 --> 01:21:52,372
You gonna help me or not?

969
01:21:52,456 --> 01:21:54,624
He ain't gettin' my money. Sorry.

970
01:22:08,847 --> 01:22:10,557
How much am I goin' for?

971
01:22:12,767 --> 01:22:15,270
-$40,000.
-That all?

972
01:22:16,396 --> 01:22:18,190
Knocked down from $75,000.

973
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:20,817
Must be out of season.

974
01:22:25,655 --> 01:22:28,033
-Where'd you getit?
-Doesn't matter.

975
01:22:30,327 --> 01:22:34,164
I could only get $27,500.
You think he'll come down more?

976
01:22:35,749 --> 01:22:37,000
Jesus Christ.

977
01:22:50,763 --> 01:22:52,682
I just thought of somethin'.

978
01:22:53,141 --> 01:22:57,061
This thing comes off, people say to you:
"Where'd you get the blond?"

979
01:22:57,270 --> 01:23:00,565
Say: "From The Money Store,
marked down from $70,000 to $27,500."

980
01:23:00,648 --> 01:23:02,066
No, I'd never say that.

981
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:05,361
I'm going home, Wayne.
Tell Frank to pick me up at home.

982
01:23:06,362 --> 01:23:08,990
I just spent a year
being somebody's property.

983
01:23:09,115 --> 01:23:10,742
Now you're gonna buy me?

984
01:23:10,825 --> 01:23:12,994
No, I'm asking you. Stay with me.

985
01:23:13,077 --> 01:23:15,913
Frank kept you, not me.
I'm not him. I'm asking you.

986
01:23:15,997 --> 01:23:18,791
If you wanna get some air,
it's okay, I understand.

987
01:23:18,875 --> 01:23:21,502
I'm not stopping you. It's okay.

988
01:23:23,296 --> 01:23:26,507
I can't go through with this.
Save your money. Takeit.

989
01:23:27,508 --> 01:23:28,801
Takeit.

990
01:23:44,483 --> 01:23:46,193
Don't be a stranger.

991
01:24:41,123 --> 01:24:42,916
I got a sense of dj vu.

992
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:45,335
Me, too.

993
01:24:48,088 --> 01:24:49,548
You got the money?

994
01:24:50,132 --> 01:24:51,967
-Nope.
-Right.

995
01:24:54,177 --> 01:24:57,306
Now I gotta get my big fuckin' ape
to go up and get her?

996
01:24:57,389 --> 01:24:59,975
Maybe she's there, maybe she's not, right?

997
01:25:01,727 --> 01:25:03,145
Guess what.

998
01:25:04,146 --> 01:25:06,773
I'm not even gonna deal
with that right now.

999
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:08,900
I told you once before...

1000
01:25:08,984 --> 01:25:12,279
...don't ever disrespect me.
Don't ever underestimate me.

1001
01:25:12,404 --> 01:25:15,115
If you do, your life becomes a raging sea.

1002
01:25:21,121 --> 01:25:22,539
Getin the car.

1003
01:25:27,794 --> 01:25:31,006
-Getin the car.
-What are you doing? I'm a cop.

1004
01:25:31,131 --> 01:25:32,340
You're shit.

1005
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:48,940
What's up, Mad Dog?

1006
01:25:50,608 --> 01:25:52,026
The 7th Cavalry.

1007
01:25:52,402 --> 01:25:55,029
What's that make us,
the friggin' Comanches?

1008
01:26:03,913 --> 01:26:07,125
You think we're gonna have
a big street fight now?

1009
01:26:15,049 --> 01:26:17,427
We'll go away. But you know what?

1010
01:26:18,845 --> 01:26:21,514
We'll get her. Somebody'll get her.

1011
01:26:23,474 --> 01:26:25,226
A hit and run, a mugging.

1012
01:26:26,602 --> 01:26:28,563
Do you know what botulismis?

1013
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:30,982
We can get her with soup.

1014
01:26:33,151 --> 01:26:34,402
Get you, too.

1015
01:26:37,613 --> 01:26:38,823
Accidents...

1016
01:26:39,782 --> 01:26:41,492
...happen all the time.

1017
01:26:42,535 --> 01:26:44,245
Then let's endit today.

1018
01:26:44,787 --> 01:26:46,664
Fine. Bring her down.

1019
01:26:46,789 --> 01:26:49,417
No. I can't be alone anymore.
I'd rather be dead.

1020
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,085
That's your fuckin' problem.

1021
01:26:51,168 --> 01:26:52,712
Come on, you and me.

1022
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,131
-You and me?
-Now. Right now.

1023
01:26:56,424 --> 01:26:58,801
-Grow up.
-Please!

1024
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:04,265
I'll fuckin' kill you! I don't care!

1025
01:27:04,515 --> 01:27:06,016
-I don't care!
-Hey, Wayne!

1026
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:08,894
-I'll fuckin' kill you right now!
-Wayne, takeit easy.

1027
01:27:08,978 --> 01:27:12,398
-I'll shoot you and eat my fuckin' gun!
-Are you fuckin' nuts?

1028
01:27:12,481 --> 01:27:15,067
-Fight me!
-Come on, Wayne!

1029
01:27:15,484 --> 01:27:17,444
Come on, Wayne. It's a girl.

1030
01:27:17,695 --> 01:27:20,656
-Fight me for her!
-Putit down.

1031
01:27:20,823 --> 01:27:23,075
-That's playground.
-Fight me for her!

1032
01:27:23,158 --> 01:27:25,661
-It's getting real crazy here.
-Fight me!

1033
01:27:25,953 --> 01:27:27,830
Wayne, come on, man.

1034
01:27:28,497 --> 01:27:29,748
-Wayne.
-Now!

1035
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:34,545
Okay. Putit down.

1036
01:27:36,714 --> 01:27:37,881
Putit down.

1037
01:27:39,091 --> 01:27:40,968
-Putit down.
-I'm puttin'it down!

1038
01:27:41,051 --> 01:27:43,512
Come on, man. Putit down.

1039
01:27:44,555 --> 01:27:45,848
Get him, Frank!

1040
01:27:52,646 --> 01:27:54,690

01:27:56,024 --> 01:27:57,818
-Come on, Wayne!

01:28:12,916 --> 01:28:15,669
-Kick him, Frankie! Go ahead!
-Get him, Wayne!

1046
01:28:21,466 --> 01:28:23,260
She's just a piranha!

1047
01:28:24,553 --> 01:28:26,805
Look what she's doin' to us...

1048
01:28:27,305 --> 01:28:30,559
-...to our friendship, man!
-Then quit.

1049
01:28:31,268 --> 01:28:32,978
You're down. Stay down.

1050
01:28:35,146 --> 01:28:37,607
Stay down, Wayne.

1051
01:29:17,313 --> 01:29:20,191
Kill him, Wayne! Don't let him up!

1052
01:29:27,615 --> 01:29:29,325
Stopit! Thisis stupid!

1053
01:29:29,951 --> 01:29:31,994
He'll kill you sooner or later.

1054
01:29:32,161 --> 01:29:34,622
I'm goin' with him. Come on, Frank.

1055
01:29:36,415 --> 01:29:38,376
-No! No!
-It's not up to you!

1056
01:29:38,501 --> 01:29:39,877
-Come on!
-No, you're not!

1057
01:29:39,961 --> 01:29:42,797
-Yes, I am!
-No, you're not! It's over!

1058
01:29:43,089 --> 01:29:45,841
It's not over till he saysit's over, Wayne.

1059
01:29:46,092 --> 01:29:47,969
Come on, Frank.

1060
01:29:49,929 --> 01:29:51,847
Come on, let's go.

1061
01:29:55,434 --> 01:29:56,477
Shut up.

1062
01:30:00,439 --> 01:30:02,692
Take her and choke on her.

1063
01:30:03,442 --> 01:30:04,485
What?

1064
01:30:04,985 --> 01:30:07,029
I wash my hands on both of you.

1065
01:30:07,113 --> 01:30:09,448
It will make my therapist very happy.

1066
01:30:15,246 --> 01:30:17,456
The expediter of your dreams, pal.

1067
01:30:23,337 --> 01:30:25,005
Kill that fuckin' cop.

1068
01:30:27,132 --> 01:30:29,009
Frankie, what's the matter with you?

1069
01:30:29,093 --> 01:30:31,595
Come on, breakit up, for Christ's sake!

1070
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:34,181
That's enough!

1071
01:30:44,108 --> 01:30:45,692
What about accidents?

1072
01:30:45,859 --> 01:30:47,778
You're the fuckin' accident.

1073
01:30:47,945 --> 01:30:49,738
Do you see who I run with?

1074
01:30:50,906 --> 01:30:52,282
Thisis my life.

1075
01:30:57,955 --> 01:30:59,665
I lost a fuckin' tooth.

1076
01:30:59,831 --> 01:31:00,874
Sorry.

1077
01:31:03,293 --> 01:31:06,380
I thought we might wind up bein' friends,
me and you.

1078
01:31:11,093 --> 01:31:12,135
Let's go.

1079
01:31:28,026 --> 01:31:29,903
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1080
01:31:31,404 --> 01:31:32,906
Way to go, Mad Dog.

1081
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:21,037
What are you gonna do?

1082
01:32:31,422 --> 01:32:32,882
Let's go home.

1083
01:32:34,467 --> 01:32:35,551
Come on.

1084
