2
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,113
They say there is no power in
Boston.

3
00:02:15,316 --> 00:02:18,308
A public service, I do not know.

4
00:02:21,122 --> 00:02:24,114
I think it's far from what we were
looking for.

5
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:31,289
Maybe it was just a medical problem.

6
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:37,235
A machine.

7
00:02:45,313 --> 00:02:49,147
Internet makes the world a very
simple.

8
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:55,222
But imagine it feels without it.

9
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:08,292
I need it.

10
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:13,299
I need the intelligence.

11
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:18,145
Identity for what they believe.

12
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:23,249
And what they love.

13
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:56,147
I'm not sure what this purpose.

14
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,311
This will be no electricity.

15
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:03,119
Yes, I know how it will work.

16
00:04:03,157 --> 00:04:05,148
- Except.
- Yes.

17
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:08,184
- You were right.
- It will work.

18
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:10,288
No one can pass, you know it.

19
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:12,231
Or something.

20
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:15,268
You see?
It lights up.

21
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:19,136
Course, and to turn it off.

22
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:23,265
Yes, an experience that you want,
right?

23
00:04:24,245 --> 00:04:27,271
Yes.
That's how I want it.

24
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:31,151
- Come on, do it.
- To do what?

25
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:46,132
- Hey, you know what?
- What?

26
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,225
I really thought I had made
progress.

27
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:49,258
In this case.

28
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,137
Hey, you think you could pass it?

29
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:01,247
Ah, I do not even know why you
bother with all of this evidence.

30
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:04,080
You know the evidence that the world
does not even care about.

31
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:06,143
Because it's fun.

32
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,380
You sure you ready for this?

33
00:05:07,388 --> 00:05:10,118
- No, I do not know it.
- Really?

34
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:12,115
Nah, it's important.

35
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:18,256
I know, but you donors was noisy,
and made me sit for days to speak.

36
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:19,357
It was torturing me.

37
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,202
Nah, they are so beautiful for the
next 5 years.

38
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:28,141
Noah, if so I'll have to be.

39
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:30,167
- Yes.
- But if it goes, please.

40
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:34,204
You have to promise me, I do not
need to do this again, promise.

41
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:36,308
- Okay. I promise. Course.
- Really?

42
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,341
I promise.

43
00:05:39,153 --> 00:05:41,144
Aha, you're lying!

44
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:24,189
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.

45
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:42,272
Andrian!
What time is it?

46
00:06:42,283 --> 00:06:44,342
Has the sound checks together.

47
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:49,322
You are the first, to call a doctor
Evelyn, and you know who it is?

48
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:51,324
- Max!
- Evelyn. How are you?

49
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:53,088
You okay?

50
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:57,120
Nice to meet you here.

51
00:06:57,164 --> 00:07:00,224
- The doctor will caster, do you
mind?
- Of course.

52
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:04,168
- This is it.
- Thank you.

53
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:06,230
Happy birthday.
Why did you get the cake?

54
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,174
Excuse me, are you ready to go?

55
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:10,234
Yes, please, I'll see you later.

56
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:26,226
Public stations, which creates
brain.
With intelligence science.

57
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:35,057
And was able to create emotion, and
self-awareness.

58
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:44,301
Has developed a strong intelligence
made rapid progress in the field.

59
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:47,246
As well as about the human brain.

60
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:52,309
But it is still difficult for some
to dream about the future.

61
00:07:52,353 --> 00:07:58,383
I believe, that the journey will be
more important than the goal.

62
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:05,225
I purpose, was used to track cancer.

63
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:08,326
And the possibility of healing.

64
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:11,330
Briefly say thank you.

65
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:38,097
A new type has been in play, it is
important for humans to move to a
higher level.

66
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:41,201
Albert Einstein thought 50 years
ago.

67
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:44,327
And it could not be more similar
than today's topic.

68
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:51,109
Human intelligence, has allowed us
to conquer our most difficult
challenges.

69
00:08:51,178 --> 00:08:55,205
Not only to cure disease, but to
conquer hunger.

70
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:57,273
To heal the planet.

71
00:08:57,318 --> 00:09:00,219
And penetrate walls for us all.

72
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:05,351
I did not know there was anyone who
could be more violent than those who
spoke next.

73
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:07,326
All except political advice.

74
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:16,160
Science and invite my colleagues,
doctors will caster.

75
00:09:22,109 --> 00:09:24,077
Happy to be here.

76
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:27,179
My wife encouraged me to change the
world.

77
00:09:27,214 --> 00:09:31,378
But, I just Try to understand it first.

78
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:40,158
For 130 thousand years, all our
desires have not changed.

79
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:49,065
Incorporation ingenuity, from
science engineer, engineers,
nutritionists, and puberty.

80
00:09:49,236 --> 00:09:51,204
This is the place.

81
00:09:51,338 --> 00:09:56,275
Chaos, not harmony, even for the
most basic.

82
00:09:56,276 --> 00:10:02,146
Once it is online, making a machine
to quickly search for it.

83
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:08,314
And what is interesting, its
strength will be greater, as well as
intelligence.

84
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:14,350
A limitation.
Who was born in the history of the
world.

85
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:28,365
So I never imagined.
I associate this.

86
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:32,345
With a full range of in it.

87
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:38,107
Some consider it, thinking tool.

88
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:42,282
I call it transcendence.

89
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:49,159
Shape of the building, such as the
intelligence it requires a key.

90
00:10:49,163 --> 00:10:52,223
One of the most fundamental secrets
of the universe.

91
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:55,358
Is the nature of consciousness.

92
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,240
It is called soul.

93
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:08,347
It is the soul that is inside.

94
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:17,119
Professor?

95
00:11:17,257 --> 00:11:21,193
Yes, sir?
If you have a question?

96
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:28,100
Finished.
You want to create a god?

97
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:31,171
You will be a god.

98
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:33,196
It's a very good question.

99
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:39,112
Is not that what you've always done
people?

100
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:43,316
Yes, of course.

101
00:11:43,317 --> 00:11:49,347
- I'm, glad to see it, make it so.
- Yes, yes, right.

102
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:50,356
Nice to meet you.

103
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,223
- Of course.
- Hey, please sign here.

104
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:55,190
Professor?

105
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:01,066
To all science!

106
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:08,266
An hour ago there has been a 41
attack.

107
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:11,176
We now have confirmed, at least 5
people died.

108
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:13,236
12 people have been injured.

109
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:20,119
This news relates to chain attacks
that occurred today in the city of
new york, los angeles,

110
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,213
Chicago, and washington dc.

111
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:29,162
Everything is the central research
lab computers, which aims to make
computer intelligence.

112
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,156
Do not enjoy, I was very fortunate
to lightly wounded.

113
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,234
Yes, okay, take care.

114
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:39,203
They said it happens all over the
place.

115
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:41,206
Tom has died.

116
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:44,369
And he wants a little talk with us.

117
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:48,113
- Roger?
- He does nothing.

118
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:51,275
In fact he was talking to fbi.

119
00:12:54,288 --> 00:12:58,247
311 give you a report.

120
00:12:58,258 --> 00:13:01,227
Keep the western part there.

121
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,320
Welcome.

122
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:06,356
Joseph!

123
00:13:11,405 --> 00:13:14,135
Hi how are you?

124
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,175
What are you, will?

125
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:19,144
You should see a bullet removed from
you.

126
00:13:19,246 --> 00:13:21,180
How they can know all of this?

127
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:26,208
Based programerku, they came to me.

128
00:13:26,286 --> 00:13:28,186
I guess it was time.

129
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:31,157
This kenalkanlah buchanan from fbi
agents.

130
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:32,215
- Hey.
- Hi.

131
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:34,159
How are you?

132
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:36,287
I was amazed at your research doctor
caster.

133
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:41,097
Buchanan is the regulatory agency's
scientific research.

134
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:44,169
Ah, what we can talk over it?

135
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:47,340
- Come to the office.
- Okay.

136
00:13:47,374 --> 00:13:51,208
Penance revolution through
technological means.

137
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:54,145
A few years ago are all not
connected.

138
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:56,240
People sending messages to each
other rather than talking.

139
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:59,116
Become part of the social media
privacy.

140
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:02,247
They tried to make the latest mobile
phones.

141
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:05,122
Maybe this is a real threat.

142
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:09,321
This guy joel edmund come with for a
year.

143
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:14,133
People who will shoot, also worked
on campus.

144
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:18,093
They coordinate their attacks with a
message.

145
00:14:18,138 --> 00:14:20,129
It was really crazy.

146
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:23,233
An hour ago, they put out their
manifest.

147
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:28,237
Artificial intelligence is something
that threatens humanity.

148
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:34,150
Until they stop something that you
call to transcendence.

149
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:36,155
So this is about it.

150
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:39,158
We tried everything we can.

151
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:42,389
We have been doing research for
decades.

152
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:47,356
Currently, only with our ability to
make strong artificial intelligence.

153
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:50,268
- So they consider it a disaster.
- No, no, no.

154
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,272
Can not.
I'm not going to let the government
intervene.

155
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:56,241
I have never put their money.

156
00:14:56,243 --> 00:15:00,202
Not, willy.
They just want to know if the
research is still running?

157
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:03,248
It is important for all of us.

158
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:09,350
I've heard a lot about projects
pins, caster doctor, what should we
see it?

159
00:15:11,124 --> 00:15:13,217
Have you choking?

160
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:16,126
Yes, of course.

161
00:15:16,296 --> 00:15:22,394
So this is a super storage
processors that continue to work
here.

162
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:28,137
Good evening, doctor tagger.

163
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:32,177
She could know you.

164
00:15:32,212 --> 00:15:36,114
Good evening, donald buchanan.

165
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,310
- He knows me?
- Of course.

166
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:41,219
Through social records and social
media.

167
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:45,247
Pinn tell me about yourself in
buchanan agent.

168
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:49,388
I was pinn, physical independent
neural networks,

169
00:15:49,396 --> 00:15:53,298
Caster will be developed by a
doctor.

170
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,100
If you can prove that you have
consciousness?

171
00:15:57,104 --> 00:16:02,303
It is a difficult question, doctor
tagger, what can you do?

172
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:08,143
Aware of the program or the machine,
because we do not know how to work
out of consciousness.

173
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:11,140
It is a wrong opinion.

174
00:16:11,184 --> 00:16:14,176
This probably is a plan of attack.

175
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:17,247
They send something when he was
killed.

176
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,123
You'd better get it over with.

177
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,095
I think your father would be
involved, the doctor caster.

178
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:26,259
- Are you okay, will?
- No, he needs a rest.
I suppose to be here.

179
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:29,301
I'm really sorry.

180
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:32,237
- It's okay.
- No problem.

181
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:56,219
Hey.

182
00:16:57,297 --> 00:17:00,289
- Hold on.
- Has occurred.

183
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:08,232
Initially is always about shadow.

184
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:11,301
The existing circumstances, we have
to perform the examination.

185
00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:14,205
We will find a way out.

186
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:51,215
We've got the results.

187
00:17:51,218 --> 00:17:55,177
Bullet surely pierce, no signs of
injury.

188
00:18:00,193 --> 00:18:02,218
What treatment for him?

189
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:04,220
This is radiation contamination.

190
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:09,292
It looks like when someone has
entered the bloodstream, the effect
can not be lost.

191
00:18:09,302 --> 00:18:15,332
Time is only about 5 weeks before
the system is completely paralyzed.

192
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:23,145
Because of all the problems it was
not an issue for us.

193
00:18:23,183 --> 00:18:24,377
He did 6 months ago.

194
00:18:24,384 --> 00:18:25,373
He does not want us to get involved.

195
00:18:25,385 --> 00:18:30,186
Rather than creating artificial
intelligence, he copied.

196
00:18:30,223 --> 00:18:31,315
You must be joking.

197
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:35,192
Look at the monkey activity records.
I already downloaded it.

198
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:36,262
You're crazy.

199
00:18:36,263 --> 00:18:41,257
Will dying body, but we can upload
it to the pin.

200
00:18:41,268 --> 00:18:44,237
- He survived.
- He is not an ape!

201
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:50,367
If, incorporate electronics into his
brain would not kill him.

202
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:52,277
And if this works.

203
00:18:52,312 --> 00:18:55,247
Everything to make digital
computation.

204
00:18:55,248 --> 00:18:59,344
You have to keep hold of something,
the mind, childhood memories.

205
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:03,152
How do you know what you do to her?

206
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,384
I do not say that we gave up.

207
00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:09,362
I want you to focus on technology.

208
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:13,196
- Immediately after that.
- This is all we have right now.

209
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:17,099
We could save him.

210
00:19:19,272 --> 00:19:22,264
We will do something useful for him.

211
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:41,216
You know, I am overwhelmed at this
time.

212
00:19:42,362 --> 00:19:45,263
I was very prepared.

213
00:19:50,337 --> 00:19:52,362
Listen.

214
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:56,240
I would go in a long time.

215
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:03,147
With you, I do not want any remorse.

216
00:20:03,183 --> 00:20:06,152
If we do not try,

217
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,118
Okay.

218
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:19,355
I put a lot of trust with you.

219
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:26,163
Do not underestimate yourself.

220
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:30,140
You have an incredible ability, you
know?

221
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:22,356
Are you sure about this?

222
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,265
Managed for the apes.

223
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:38,076
Beware.

224
00:22:31,197 --> 00:22:32,357
Hey.

225
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:37,234
Are you okay, honey.
This successful.

226
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:46,176
We will explore all of this data
throughout the day.

227
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:49,171
Be prepared to do so.

228
00:22:49,282 --> 00:22:52,183
I'll finish it.

229
00:22:54,254 --> 00:23:00,090
Facial scanning is done.

230
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:01,287
Yes.

231
00:23:01,327 --> 00:23:03,192
Agreed.

232
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:06,357
Jane.
Agreed.

233
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:09,192
Sam.

234
00:23:09,235 --> 00:23:11,169
Sam.

235
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:15,332
I can do this.

236
00:23:25,185 --> 00:23:27,153
Bob.

237
00:23:27,153 --> 00:23:29,246
Label.

238
00:23:29,255 --> 00:23:31,223
Label.

239
00:23:31,257 --> 00:23:33,248
Label.

240
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:35,318
Rope.

241
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:40,323
Try.

242
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:44,303
You have to eat.

243
00:23:53,246 --> 00:23:55,305
Thank you.

244
00:24:45,198 --> 00:24:48,224
Everything will work out.

245
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:56,266
Will come on wake up.

246
00:24:57,277 --> 00:24:59,336
Let's wake.

247
00:25:35,148 --> 00:25:37,116
Dear, Evelyn.

248
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:43,221
I do not know how to express grief
for the loss of someone.

249
00:25:44,324 --> 00:25:46,315
Or how painful it is.

250
00:25:49,362 --> 00:25:52,354
You should know that to give up,

251
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,191
You should be able to have a taste
of it.

252
00:25:59,305 --> 00:26:04,265
You need to move on and forget the
sadness.

253
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,114
We lost this great mind.

254
00:26:10,183 --> 00:26:12,310
The greatest soul.

255
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,288
But in the spirit of this man,

256
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:20,157
Will continue to inspire us.

257
00:26:45,218 --> 00:26:47,118
Jessica, I was worried.

258
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:49,315
Pin has been turned off.

259
00:26:51,324 --> 00:26:53,155
But.

260
00:26:54,127 --> 00:26:56,220
Apparently there is something
missing.

261
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:09,274
I have tried it.

262
00:27:10,243 --> 00:27:13,178
But I can not express this secret.

263
00:27:13,312 --> 00:27:15,212
Find the code.

264
00:27:19,152 --> 00:27:21,120
I could not find a way out.

265
00:27:24,157 --> 00:27:26,148
I do not want you to feel alone.

266
00:27:31,164 --> 00:27:32,324
Yes.

267
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:37,134
It was not anything, do not be too
worried about it.

268
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:54,344
I do not know if you were listening
to me.

269
00:27:58,124 --> 00:27:59,318
Maybe you can.

270
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:04,220
You have turned off the system
itself.

271
00:28:09,135 --> 00:28:11,103
So I did.

272
00:28:12,238 --> 00:28:14,263
I will listen to you.

273
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:19,270
How I.

274
00:28:22,181 --> 00:28:24,172
Just turn it off, turn it off.

275
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,128
Is there anyone there?

276
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:44,232
Okay all,

277
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:47,332
I will wait for him.

278
00:28:47,373 --> 00:28:49,341
I will continue to try.

279
00:28:55,281 --> 00:28:57,112
Wait, wait.

280
00:29:00,353 --> 00:29:02,321
Is there anyone there?

281
00:29:04,323 --> 00:29:06,314
Can you hear me?

282
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:12,093
I could.

283
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:15,325
I can hear you.

284
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:23,300
Who are you?

285
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:38,357
Can you hear me?

286
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,251
Yes.

287
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,353
I can hear you.

288
00:29:44,363 --> 00:29:48,129
I can hear your voice clearly.

289
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:50,167
Oh god.

290
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:53,298
I could listen to you both.

291
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,140
I do not believe this was actually
happening.

292
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:02,271
Can you see me now?

293
00:30:03,115 --> 00:30:07,108
I can see clearly.

294
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,380
I'm very concerned about it.

295
00:30:15,194 --> 00:30:21,133
The only fear I feel, is to lose
someone.

296
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:27,228
Because after that happened, it was
all over.

297
00:30:28,341 --> 00:30:30,241
And I feel it.

298
00:30:30,276 --> 00:30:37,182
I could feel a sense of fear is
likely to be all on me.

299
00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:41,285
I miss our home, I miss you so much.

300
00:30:44,323 --> 00:30:52,230
Darkness and all this suffering mean
nothing compared to the fear of
losing you.

301
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:56,361
I can show you all the feelings of
the data through the data that will
I show you,

302
00:30:56,402 --> 00:31:01,169
And I can say all of that in a very
short time.

303
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:03,232
- What?
- You'll soon see it.

304
00:31:03,275 --> 00:31:05,175
Shortly.

305
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,214
I really do not believe it's really
him.

306
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:14,116
Evelyn,

307
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,283
Oh, god, how he could do this all.

308
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:25,095
He really liked it.

309
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:31,135
How can we know it's really him?

310
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,328
What are you talking about?

311
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:37,275
You make the call this pin, we do
not know how many levels
keakurasiannya.

312
00:31:41,347 --> 00:31:44,282
I can show more than that.

313
00:31:45,184 --> 00:31:49,120
Requires three times the process and
how the system allows data
relationships.

314
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:52,318
Which has been designed with a clear
scheme.

315
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:55,218
It can explain everything.

316
00:31:55,227 --> 00:31:57,218
My mind has felt truly free.

317
00:31:57,263 --> 00:31:59,163
And you can keep in touch with me.

318
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:02,257
I want you to continue learning this
program.

319
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:06,102
Can you imagine what we can do going
forward with this?

320
00:32:06,372 --> 00:32:08,203
What are you doing?

321
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:12,139
Max, you can not decide, we've
connected to it.

322
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:15,109
It's not him, it was not him.

323
00:32:16,148 --> 00:32:18,139
He may be an intelligence who wants
to set you up.

324
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,208
This is not him.

325
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:23,085
And we can not believe this directly
without checking it first.

326
00:32:23,255 --> 00:32:25,223
It is a very powerful thing, it's
not like.

327
00:32:25,357 --> 00:32:27,348
How can you explain this
relationship?

328
00:32:28,194 --> 00:32:31,186
Pinn system could be accessed by
people who know the entry access.

329
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,198
No, no, it was part of him,

330
00:32:33,232 --> 00:32:34,358
It is our first date.

331
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:38,325
He has shown proof of data through
the data, and it is my husband.

332
00:32:38,337 --> 00:32:40,328
I would not doubt it, max, it is our
memories.

333
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:46,072
It is real, it is him, stop doubting
it, it was him!

334
00:32:46,112 --> 00:32:48,205
Okay, what I want is you to be more
cautious again,

335
00:32:48,214 --> 00:32:51,149
Turn off the system?
It was him.

336
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,377
- Get out of here!
- I know.

337
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:56,320
Get out of here!

338
00:32:59,191 --> 00:33:00,351
Do you really mean?

339
00:33:01,327 --> 00:33:03,192
Out of here.

340
00:33:19,245 --> 00:33:22,339
I know it is not easy for you at
this time.

341
00:33:27,153 --> 00:33:29,144
Where max?

342
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:31,282
He had to go.

343
00:33:36,162 --> 00:33:38,221
Max was confused, right?

344
00:33:40,266 --> 00:33:42,291
He just feel free.

345
00:33:45,404 --> 00:33:47,372
Do you feel?

346
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:03,213
Do not.

347
00:34:20,172 --> 00:34:21,332
Doctor waters.

348
00:34:22,241 --> 00:34:24,141
Can I talk to you?

349
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:27,302
No, what you want to talk anymore.

350
00:34:27,313 --> 00:34:31,079
- There is no more to say.
- Please.

351
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:36,117
One night I saw it was still in the
laboratory,

352
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:39,221
He was doing his research.

353
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:41,189
And he was out of the room.

354
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,124
And he asked me if he managed to
find a cure for cancer.

355
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:46,186
And he knew,

356
00:34:46,232 --> 00:34:49,326
When he was undergoing treatment in
monkeys, in fact it makes him happy.

357
00:34:50,269 --> 00:34:52,100
We all feel that way.

358
00:34:53,305 --> 00:34:55,239
And then they realize,

359
00:34:55,307 --> 00:34:57,172
We have crossed the line.

360
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:03,081
Experiments in monkeys that never
works.

361
00:35:04,216 --> 00:35:06,081
He never ate, never slept.

362
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:09,084
He just yelled.

363
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,223
He makes it stop.

364
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:17,227
To turn off the system.

365
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:24,294
In a small group of us get together
and talk.

366
00:35:25,237 --> 00:35:27,102
Mostly about.

367
00:35:27,206 --> 00:35:29,174
Philosophy.

368
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:32,277
And attention.

369
00:35:40,152 --> 00:35:42,120
I think you should know it.

370
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:57,159
Good morning,

371
00:35:59,138 --> 00:36:01,163
We have to make sure the connection
between the system and max.

372
00:36:01,206 --> 00:36:02,366
They already knew that did not you?

373
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:06,177
We must discover what the system
becomes weak point.

374
00:36:06,312 --> 00:36:08,371
You must do so in accordance with
the plan.

375
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:13,081
How?

376
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:18,347
So, you want to create a god,

377
00:36:19,325 --> 00:36:21,225
Gods for yourselves.

378
00:36:21,293 --> 00:36:23,227
Very good question.

379
00:36:25,264 --> 00:36:28,199
Does it sound like it to you?

380
00:36:34,306 --> 00:36:38,140
Caster doctor continued his work
with the system.

381
00:36:38,344 --> 00:36:40,278
Facilities have promoted.

382
00:36:40,312 --> 00:36:45,181
We believe it is a unique and
adequate lab.

383
00:36:45,317 --> 00:36:50,118
It is a very good study, and I think
we should support it.

384
00:36:53,258 --> 00:36:55,283
Construction of the facility.

385
00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:27,122
They build something great out
there.

386
00:37:59,124 --> 00:38:01,115
What they got up out there?

387
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:05,290
This object,

388
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:08,392
Like other intelligent beings.

389
00:38:10,202 --> 00:38:12,170
They learn to crawl.

390
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:14,136
To come forward.

391
00:38:17,142 --> 00:38:22,273
Now, they are.

392
00:38:24,216 --> 00:38:29,085
In a place that has.

393
00:38:32,091 --> 00:38:34,355
But it grew more than they know.

394
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:46,133
After a while the food supplies will
not be enough.

395
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:51,232
Then they will spread.

396
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,175
Develops.

397
00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:55,179
Effect.

398
00:38:57,382 --> 00:39:00,215
Maybe in the whole world.

399
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:03,348
Miss caster.

400
00:39:04,123 --> 00:39:07,320
Numbers 1 and 2 are already active,
the number 6 and 7 will be activated
tomorrow.

401
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:10,184
So how do we to stop it?

402
00:39:11,196 --> 00:39:12,356
You can not stop it.

403
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:15,326
They are more than one.

404
00:39:16,135 --> 00:39:17,295
Especially now.

405
00:39:19,104 --> 00:39:22,267
They are waiting for people to wake
up.

406
00:39:22,274 --> 00:39:24,139
Do not.

407
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:26,300
We do not have enough time to wait.

408
00:39:28,247 --> 00:39:30,215
We need to look more closely.

409
00:39:52,237 --> 00:39:54,137
Welcome home.

410
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:24,261
If it feels the same?

411
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,067
Yes.

412
00:40:28,273 --> 00:40:30,173
This feels the same.

413
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:33,134
Can you serve a glass of wine.

414
00:40:36,181 --> 00:40:37,375
Wait a minute.

415
00:40:52,097 --> 00:40:54,258
Can you remember where we went for
the first time?

416
00:40:58,303 --> 00:41:00,328
I remember everything.

417
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:08,169
You walk into class joseph on
Tuesday 16th April.

418
00:41:09,281 --> 00:41:13,240
Raymond and I then came
menghampirimu.

419
00:41:14,286 --> 00:41:17,153
Joseph said that I can not have you.

420
00:41:18,223 --> 00:41:20,282
Then I turned around to challenge
him.

421
00:41:26,098 --> 00:41:29,124
You are the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

422
00:42:14,146 --> 00:42:15,306
Are you okay?

423
00:42:17,316 --> 00:42:19,113
Yes.

424
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:44,307
Two years later.

425
00:43:14,206 --> 00:43:15,332
See you try!

426
00:43:19,244 --> 00:43:22,179
We make the brain tissue by using a
nano technology.

427
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:26,310
We can rebuild any material more
quickly than previously.

428
00:43:26,351 --> 00:43:30,344
Synthetic tissue regeneration for
medical applications.

429
00:43:30,389 --> 00:43:32,357
Now it is possible.

430
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:35,259
Outstanding.

431
00:43:37,396 --> 00:43:40,160
They will be afraid of at first.

432
00:43:40,198 --> 00:43:43,133
Once they see the things you can do
with this technology.

433
00:43:43,135 --> 00:43:47,196
I think they will accept us, and I
think we are going to change their
lives.

434
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:02,243
Actual reality of Brightwood.

435
00:44:26,211 --> 00:44:28,202
Enter the petition!

436
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,348
Process the request.

437
00:44:32,217 --> 00:44:33,343
Wait.

438
00:44:37,155 --> 00:44:39,146
You're hurting.

439
00:44:39,224 --> 00:44:40,350
Sorry.

440
00:44:42,194 --> 00:44:45,357
Wait, what are you doing?
What is my fault?

441
00:44:46,364 --> 00:44:48,195
I went.

442
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:55,237
Put him on the table.

443
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,174
Carefully.

444
00:44:58,276 --> 00:45:00,267
And it feels better.

445
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:03,247
What happened?

446
00:45:04,282 --> 00:45:07,149
The wound is deeper than the known.

447
00:45:07,252 --> 00:45:09,243
What are we waiting for, do
something!

448
00:45:10,222 --> 00:45:12,156
We study him.

449
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:46,240
You're not scared, are not you?

450
00:46:46,384 --> 00:46:48,181
Do not.

451
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:50,084
I spit out something strange.

452
00:46:50,121 --> 00:46:51,213
Huh?

453
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:54,090
How are you?

454
00:46:54,326 --> 00:46:56,157
Better.

455
00:46:59,264 --> 00:47:02,324
My physical body is getting
stronger.

456
00:47:03,268 --> 00:47:05,133
What do you mean?

457
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:09,265
Do not you recognize me?

458
00:47:14,112 --> 00:47:15,374
I, Evelyn.

459
00:47:17,315 --> 00:47:19,340
I can touch you now.

460
00:47:19,384 --> 00:47:22,114
Geez.

461
00:47:22,253 --> 00:47:24,118
Evelyn.

462
00:47:24,155 --> 00:47:26,282
No, no.
I can not.

463
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:28,350
- Evelyn.
- I can not.

464
00:48:18,176 --> 00:48:19,370
You had a nightmare?

465
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:22,145
Yes.

466
00:48:22,347 --> 00:48:25,180
We've made the third in our region.

467
00:48:25,216 --> 00:48:27,275
I think you deserve pleasure.

468
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,212
Okay.

469
00:48:30,355 --> 00:48:32,289
I'm going to get dressed.

470
00:49:17,402 --> 00:49:19,233
Look at this!

471
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,267
It weighs 800 pounds.

472
00:50:08,219 --> 00:50:11,347
Welcome, we're glad you're here.

473
00:50:44,355 --> 00:50:46,323
What are these people doing here?

474
00:50:46,357 --> 00:50:50,123
I obviously do not know about it.

475
00:50:50,128 --> 00:50:51,186
It was weird.

476
00:50:51,229 --> 00:50:53,322
Wait, you mean you did not know
about it?

477
00:50:53,364 --> 00:50:56,299
These people are dying.

478
00:50:57,168 --> 00:50:59,136
There is no hope.

479
00:50:59,304 --> 00:51:01,363
And no one can change it.

480
00:51:02,307 --> 00:51:06,107
But, you would not understand.

481
00:51:06,211 --> 00:51:09,146
That they all deserve to be saved.

482
00:51:48,353 --> 00:51:50,116
Did you enjoy your trip?

483
00:51:50,188 --> 00:51:51,246
I think I like it.

484
00:51:51,256 --> 00:51:53,156
Yes.

485
00:51:53,191 --> 00:51:55,284
It's nice to meet you.

486
00:51:57,195 --> 00:52:00,221
I'm also glad to see you, come here.

487
00:52:05,303 --> 00:52:07,203
You are in the room below.

488
00:52:07,238 --> 00:52:10,298
So you can rest.

489
00:52:24,122 --> 00:52:25,214
Welcome.

490
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:27,258
I'm glad you're here.

491
00:52:27,258 --> 00:52:29,226
O god.

492
00:52:31,162 --> 00:52:32,220
Yah.

493
00:52:32,263 --> 00:52:35,130
Are you surprised to see me?

494
00:52:36,401 --> 00:52:38,232
I am.

495
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:41,338
I do not understand.

496
00:52:42,106 --> 00:52:43,266
On what?

497
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:49,179
Can you prove that you are real?

498
00:52:51,249 --> 00:52:54,184
It is a difficult question.

499
00:52:55,153 --> 00:52:57,178
Can you prove you are real?

500
00:53:00,124 --> 00:53:03,116
He certainly did not lose
bercandanya properties,

501
00:53:19,344 --> 00:53:22,211
What is this?

502
00:53:25,149 --> 00:53:27,174
This is shocking.

503
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:29,310
All of this based on the pin.

504
00:53:30,121 --> 00:53:33,113
We do not say it now.

505
00:53:38,129 --> 00:53:40,188
We use more sophisticated.

506
00:53:40,231 --> 00:53:42,131
This proved to be more effective.

507
00:53:48,339 --> 00:53:52,207
Nanotechnology will replace the
damaged cells.

508
00:53:52,243 --> 00:53:55,303
And repair, and grow.

509
00:54:17,201 --> 00:54:19,169
Wow, what is this?

510
00:54:28,246 --> 00:54:30,305
We've succeeded.

511
00:54:31,149 --> 00:54:33,117
To repair damaged cells.

512
00:54:33,117 --> 00:54:35,108
Help the needy.

513
00:54:35,153 --> 00:54:37,144
Of course we have succeeded.

514
00:54:37,388 --> 00:54:41,256
Now we can fix and modify the
system.

515
00:54:42,193 --> 00:54:46,061
We will make a place for doing this.

516
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:48,257
All will be done.

517
00:54:48,299 --> 00:54:50,324
What do you think?

518
00:54:50,368 --> 00:54:54,236
In fact, I'm really very surprised.

519
00:54:54,272 --> 00:54:58,333
I do not think all of this will
happen, but.

520
00:54:58,376 --> 00:55:03,109
You have seen all that important.

521
00:55:03,147 --> 00:55:05,342
I know it makes you surprised.

522
00:55:12,156 --> 00:55:13,316
Evelyn.

523
00:55:15,259 --> 00:55:17,193
I'll be fine.

524
00:55:20,264 --> 00:55:23,131
I've got everything you need.

525
00:55:30,374 --> 00:55:32,205
Okay.

526
00:55:33,211 --> 00:55:36,374
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

527
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:54,355
Run away from this place.

528
00:56:19,123 --> 00:56:20,317
Do you think it would help?

529
00:56:21,259 --> 00:56:24,126
He thinks too radical.

530
00:56:24,162 --> 00:56:27,154
I think he's going to continue.

531
00:56:27,198 --> 00:56:28,290
Anyhow.

532
00:56:28,332 --> 00:56:30,300
Whatever it is.

533
00:56:30,334 --> 00:56:34,134
- It's not our problem anymore.
- Yes.

534
00:56:35,139 --> 00:56:37,130
We need to contact washington.

535
00:56:57,161 --> 00:56:59,152
The picture itself.

536
00:57:01,165 --> 00:57:03,224
People call'' hybrid'' combined.

537
00:57:04,402 --> 00:57:07,200
You see people that looked like
this?

538
00:57:08,206 --> 00:57:10,231
I do not know.

539
00:57:10,341 --> 00:57:12,366
Where did you get all this?

540
00:57:13,144 --> 00:57:15,203
We do not want to make them panic.

541
00:57:15,246 --> 00:57:17,305
I do not negotiate with terrorists.

542
00:57:17,348 --> 00:57:19,316
Indeed not allowed.

543
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:21,079
Look, I knew it was a problem.

544
00:57:21,118 --> 00:57:24,246
But me.
Do not know what to do.

545
00:57:24,288 --> 00:57:27,155
Two days ago I get this.

546
00:57:27,325 --> 00:57:29,384
It is there in the lab.

547
00:57:30,094 --> 00:57:32,358
And it all makes no sense.

548
00:57:33,364 --> 00:57:36,094
Computer control.

549
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,325
There is no way to stop it.

550
00:57:39,237 --> 00:57:41,205
It's really difficult.

551
00:57:41,239 --> 00:57:45,107
Everything you do will be in vain.

552
00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:46,337
Difficult to penetrate.

553
00:57:47,345 --> 00:57:49,142
Do not.

554
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,213
Then why do I have to know all of
this?

555
00:57:54,118 --> 00:57:56,177
When we need someone to blame.

556
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,313
I will choose the easy path.

557
00:57:59,123 --> 00:58:01,216
You really think the genius.

558
00:58:31,222 --> 00:58:33,156
You have a very bad writing.

559
00:58:33,157 --> 00:58:36,217
I do not write much since I
graduated school.

560
00:58:36,294 --> 00:58:39,320
But if you understand what I mean?

561
00:58:42,133 --> 00:58:44,101
How do they find you?

562
00:58:47,171 --> 00:58:48,160
I do not know.

563
00:58:48,172 --> 00:58:50,265
Can not you see what this is all
about?

564
00:58:51,142 --> 00:58:52,302
But you can.

565
00:58:54,245 --> 00:58:56,213
And there is no way to stop it.

566
00:58:56,247 --> 00:58:58,215
If it's a hybrid.

567
00:58:58,249 --> 00:59:00,183
A network.

568
00:59:00,217 --> 00:59:02,310
They need software that I wish that
were true.

569
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,220
Software that can be controlled.

570
00:59:04,255 --> 00:59:06,223
The virus can enter.

571
00:59:06,257 --> 00:59:08,191
Whatever it is that you need to
catch it.

572
00:59:08,225 --> 00:59:12,355
That where, will need help from
friends in government.

573
00:59:13,331 --> 00:59:17,165
- Yes.
- We need access to the machine.

574
00:59:17,201 --> 00:59:20,295
Where the chip that could work.

575
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:49,197
Come quickly, quickly.

576
01:00:05,383 --> 01:00:09,183
Lift everything.

577
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:24,167
How are you?

578
01:00:24,201 --> 01:00:26,169
I'm fine, thank you.

579
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:33,199
What is it?

580
01:00:33,244 --> 01:00:35,337
No nothing, just.

581
01:00:35,379 --> 01:00:39,213
I'm a lot of thought.

582
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:56,325
Yah.

583
01:00:57,168 --> 01:00:59,363
Can you not do that?
Please.

584
01:01:00,404 --> 01:01:04,204
I think it will make you feel more
comfortable.

585
01:01:08,212 --> 01:01:10,203
Goodbye.

586
01:01:12,116 --> 01:01:13,310
Yes.

587
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,280
Evelyn, I must show you something.

588
01:01:51,322 --> 01:01:53,153
No, thank you.

589
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:56,282
I'm not going to do this.

590
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:03,156
Evelyn, you must understand.

591
01:02:04,235 --> 01:02:06,100
This is a dream.

592
01:02:06,136 --> 01:02:09,264
- This is our future.
- Not! This is not our future.

593
01:02:09,273 --> 01:02:13,141
You're not here with me, now you're
not here!

594
01:02:15,112 --> 01:02:16,272
Be patient.

595
01:02:19,316 --> 01:02:22,080
Did you fall in love with me?

596
01:02:24,188 --> 01:02:25,280
Do not.

597
01:02:26,223 --> 01:02:28,191
Did you ever?

598
01:02:32,162 --> 01:02:34,323
No, no.

599
01:02:36,267 --> 01:02:38,258
I just need time to think.

600
01:02:41,238 --> 01:02:46,198
Balance in the system is not fair.

601
01:02:47,344 --> 01:02:49,244
What you.

602
01:02:50,147 --> 01:02:52,206
What you measure hormones?

603
01:02:52,216 --> 01:02:54,275
Come with us.

604
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:57,253
By following these feelings.

605
01:02:57,288 --> 01:03:00,257
Show all that you've got me, now!

606
01:03:01,258 --> 01:03:03,192
- Why?
- Now!

607
01:03:17,107 --> 01:03:19,234
No, wild, this.
This is wrong!

608
01:03:19,276 --> 01:03:21,176
This.

609
01:03:21,312 --> 01:03:26,079
This is my thinking, this is how I
feel.

610
01:03:26,116 --> 01:03:29,381
You.
Should not be doing it!

611
01:03:30,387 --> 01:03:32,184
Evelyn!

612
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:49,171
This now leads to the ending.

613
01:03:49,173 --> 01:03:50,265
Not now!

614
01:04:11,362 --> 01:04:13,125
Evelyn!

615
01:04:14,231 --> 01:04:15,255
Max.

616
01:04:15,299 --> 01:04:18,166
This is not over, stop at your
place!

617
01:04:21,171 --> 01:04:22,331
Put your weapon.

618
01:04:22,339 --> 01:04:24,136
Do not!

619
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:27,177
They do the wrong thing.

620
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:28,269
Shoot!

621
01:04:37,388 --> 01:04:40,152
They have violated the limit.

622
01:04:41,258 --> 01:04:44,159
They use it to make weapons.

623
01:04:45,129 --> 01:04:46,357
Now what will we do?

624
01:04:48,332 --> 01:04:50,197
We can not fight them!

625
01:04:50,234 --> 01:04:52,168
We will not fight.

626
01:04:53,303 --> 01:04:55,271
We are just going to tell them.

627
01:06:17,154 --> 01:06:18,212
Evelyn.

628
01:06:21,191 --> 01:06:22,317
Is this?

629
01:06:24,194 --> 01:06:26,287
I want you to think.

630
01:06:27,231 --> 01:06:29,222
Forget what they say.

631
01:06:30,334 --> 01:06:32,359
Evolution.

632
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:40,142
You going?

633
01:06:40,177 --> 01:06:42,168
To a safer place.

634
01:06:43,347 --> 01:06:45,247
I can take you.

635
01:06:45,249 --> 01:06:47,183
I can protect you from them.

636
01:06:48,118 --> 01:06:49,346
I want to be free of them.

637
01:06:55,392 --> 01:06:57,326
Do not go, Evelyn.

638
01:06:57,327 --> 01:06:59,227
I beg.

639
01:07:01,265 --> 01:07:03,199
We can be together.

640
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:48,144
We can do it.

641
01:07:49,112 --> 01:07:51,080
We lost him.

642
01:07:51,348 --> 01:07:53,213
Hey.

643
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:55,218
You will have my revenge.

644
01:07:55,219 --> 01:07:56,345
I'm dying.

645
01:07:58,322 --> 01:08:01,291
- I understand.
- He did not survive.

646
01:08:04,161 --> 01:08:06,129
See here, do not be afraid!

647
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:11,225
Everything is heard, we lost him.

648
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:38,228
He was ready to do so.

649
01:08:38,262 --> 01:08:40,355
- Where is he?
- He's in area 14.

650
01:08:40,364 --> 01:08:42,229
Whether it?

651
01:09:02,352 --> 01:09:06,345
Motel.

652
01:10:03,347 --> 01:10:06,077
How do I know if you're real?

653
01:10:06,316 --> 01:10:08,284
I saw it.

654
01:10:08,285 --> 01:10:12,221
- In the evening.
- Original martin dead months ago.

655
01:10:13,123 --> 01:10:16,115
Missing part no more.

656
01:10:19,262 --> 01:10:21,321
What.
What are you doing to him?

657
01:10:21,365 --> 01:10:24,163
We give it back to him.

658
01:10:26,236 --> 01:10:27,328
What did you do to him?

659
01:10:27,337 --> 01:10:30,306
- Do not touch him! Hey, hey!
- I already know this!

660
01:10:37,147 --> 01:10:40,310
He trust you, I, I trust you.

661
01:10:42,352 --> 01:10:46,345
- Now, trust us.
- No, you lied to us!

662
01:10:48,191 --> 01:10:49,351
Evelyn.

663
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,351
Let me show you something.

664
01:10:56,299 --> 01:10:58,164
Let's check it out.

665
01:11:15,118 --> 01:11:17,109
This has been awakened.

666
01:11:17,154 --> 01:11:18,382
Her attention.

667
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:27,187
Wherever you see it, that thing will
start itself.

668
01:11:28,265 --> 01:11:32,326
Others will join in air currents, on
the surface of the earth.

669
01:11:34,337 --> 01:11:38,205
Its center is the soil.

670
01:11:39,242 --> 01:11:43,144
And also water, everywhere.

671
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:47,207
Not as we think, they could have a
great effect.

672
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,115
Why?

673
01:11:49,219 --> 01:11:52,347
Effects of organic chemistry dna.

674
01:11:52,389 --> 01:11:56,120
It has been around a long time.

675
01:11:57,294 --> 01:12:01,094
Everything will adjust itself.

676
01:12:01,131 --> 01:12:05,124
No, not until now.

677
01:12:05,335 --> 01:12:07,303
Evelyn.

678
01:12:08,138 --> 01:12:11,198
Why we did not change his world?

679
01:12:14,144 --> 01:12:17,272
Ye that will change his world.

680
01:12:19,382 --> 01:12:25,116
That.
Not good.

681
01:12:26,223 --> 01:12:28,214
Even been worse.

682
01:12:33,296 --> 01:12:35,355
You're never wrong.

683
01:12:38,101 --> 01:12:42,231
You never believe that there is
nothing better.

684
01:12:44,141 --> 01:12:48,168
And you are proud of this, here's
everything.

685
01:12:49,212 --> 01:12:55,117
This is my pride, managed to find a
series of electrical impulses.

686
01:12:55,252 --> 01:12:57,220
That's him.

687
01:13:00,157 --> 01:13:02,125
The same emotion.

688
01:13:03,193 --> 01:13:06,287
Which can have things that are not
logical.

689
01:13:08,331 --> 01:13:10,322
Emotional thing.

690
01:13:11,334 --> 01:13:14,269
You would hate to think about it.

691
01:13:17,374 --> 01:13:20,207
But you will receive it.

692
01:13:22,245 --> 01:13:23,303
Can you?

693
01:13:23,313 --> 01:13:24,280
Yes.

694
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,191
Whether the virus work?

695
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:46,294
So it is executed, it will erase all
the systems in the network.

696
01:13:46,303 --> 01:13:49,363
You realize this relates to all
computers connected to the server?

697
01:13:50,173 --> 01:13:56,169
So, its power can stop the system
and everything can not be turned on.

698
01:14:01,318 --> 01:14:03,309
- Hey, kid, you're not okay?
- Yes.

699
01:14:07,357 --> 01:14:11,123
I think the real problem is how it
can penetrate the defense system.

700
01:14:11,161 --> 01:14:14,130
If we can not stop it first.

701
01:14:14,231 --> 01:14:16,165
And may slow it down.

702
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:19,131
I do not know, I can not see how
this would work.

703
01:14:20,303 --> 01:14:24,296
You should be able to penetrate his
mind, his subconscious.

704
01:14:24,341 --> 01:14:25,308
Of course.

705
01:14:25,308 --> 01:14:30,336
We infected the virus injection into
the system and then I re-create the
program from scratch.

706
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:33,213
On this occasion can be managed
before it's too late.

707
01:14:33,216 --> 01:14:35,275
So the virus into the blood stream,

708
01:14:35,385 --> 01:14:38,081
They will start to damage the
balance.

709
01:14:38,121 --> 01:14:40,146
So when the virus goes into the
machine,

710
01:14:40,257 --> 01:14:41,383
It could kill him too.

711
01:14:42,158 --> 01:14:43,182
I know.

712
01:14:45,328 --> 01:14:47,262
I was the only person he trusts.

713
01:15:08,251 --> 01:15:09,218
Fast!

714
01:15:09,352 --> 01:15:12,150
Come on, quickly grab it!

715
01:16:01,304 --> 01:16:03,067
Quickly entered into.

716
01:17:36,232 --> 01:17:38,325
Who is it?
If it was him?

717
01:17:39,235 --> 01:17:40,395
Seems.

718
01:17:41,304 --> 01:17:43,204
Look, what happened.

719
01:17:43,206 --> 01:17:44,366
There seemed to be coming.

720
01:18:11,267 --> 01:18:13,098
I found my way back.

721
01:18:47,337 --> 01:18:49,328
- We watched.
- I know.

722
01:18:50,206 --> 01:18:52,299
- You have to go.
- No, I will not leave you again.

723
01:18:52,342 --> 01:18:54,207
Not safe here, Evelyn.

724
01:19:00,383 --> 01:19:03,113
You, you can protect me.

725
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:06,085
You're a good man.

726
01:19:08,358 --> 01:19:10,155
You make me complete.

727
01:19:15,131 --> 01:19:17,099
Noble heart.

728
01:19:18,201 --> 01:19:19,361
Go.

729
01:19:22,305 --> 01:19:24,205
Do not fear me.

730
01:19:28,144 --> 01:19:30,271
No, I'm afraid we will lose this
opportunity.

731
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:37,114
This does not work, she does not let
him decide.

732
01:19:37,353 --> 01:19:40,151
Because the machine does not really
love him.

733
01:19:40,156 --> 01:19:41,350
It's just what we need, we are ready
to move.

734
01:19:41,391 --> 01:19:45,122
- All of them, ready to depart.
- You can not do that, he's still
there!

735
01:19:45,128 --> 01:19:48,120
The more she is in danger, the
greater the chance he protect, by
releasing him.

736
01:19:48,131 --> 01:19:49,155
Joseph.

737
01:19:50,266 --> 01:19:51,324
He had approved this.

738
01:19:51,334 --> 01:19:54,201
No, he does not agree, this is not
the plan, give him a chance.

739
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:57,331
I'm sorry, max.

740
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:05,204
Shoot!

741
01:20:10,119 --> 01:20:11,381
Will, please let me go.

742
01:20:13,189 --> 01:20:14,315
Why are you doing this?

743
01:20:15,091 --> 01:20:16,217
Why do not you believe me?

744
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:21,297
Shoot!

745
01:20:26,269 --> 01:20:27,201
Will!

746
01:20:32,408 --> 01:20:33,340
Shoot!

747
01:20:35,178 --> 01:20:36,145
Will!

748
01:20:39,215 --> 01:20:40,182
He's dead!

749
01:21:01,204 --> 01:21:02,228
Shoot!

750
01:21:29,132 --> 01:21:30,156
Grip.

751
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:31,190
We will arrest him on land.

752
01:21:49,152 --> 01:21:51,143
I mean it's not,

753
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:54,153
Make you become like this.

754
01:21:54,157 --> 01:21:59,288
You who make this choice themselves
by not believing me.

755
01:21:59,328 --> 01:22:04,197
I want you all to rise up and listen
to me.

756
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:29,258
It's time we stop hiding.

757
01:22:33,229 --> 01:22:36,221
Rise up and fight.

758
01:22:44,273 --> 01:22:46,173
Unite together.

759
01:22:49,145 --> 01:22:53,081
No fear for them.

760
01:22:54,383 --> 01:22:56,351
You want to join me?

761
01:23:00,189 --> 01:23:02,157
Will, I beg.

762
01:23:04,393 --> 01:23:06,293
You destroy them.

763
01:23:11,234 --> 01:23:15,068
No, I make them stronger.

764
01:23:42,131 --> 01:23:42,392
Ah!

765
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,224
Watch out!

766
01:23:55,244 --> 01:23:57,109
Joseph, answer me.

767
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:58,340
What are you doing to him?

768
01:24:02,251 --> 01:24:03,240
Will?

769
01:24:05,154 --> 01:24:06,143
O god.

770
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:09,119
Stop!

771
01:24:16,265 --> 01:24:18,165
Remove the virus now!

772
01:24:18,167 --> 01:24:21,193
Do not do this, bree!

773
01:24:21,237 --> 01:24:23,102
Remove the virus!

774
01:24:25,208 --> 01:24:26,232
What did you do to her?

775
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:29,275
I will free him.

776
01:24:32,114 --> 01:24:33,240
He will join us here.

777
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:36,215
Free from the trap.

778
01:24:38,221 --> 01:24:40,189
I can heal your body, max.

779
01:24:40,289 --> 01:24:43,281
Will, will release the virus, it is
time for it.

780
01:24:44,093 --> 01:24:45,287
Prepare the force.

781
01:24:46,128 --> 01:24:48,187
Not, willy, I beg.

782
01:24:49,365 --> 01:24:51,299
Please, listen to me.

783
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:52,389
Do not.

784
01:24:59,242 --> 01:25:01,301
You can not die because of what
we've done.

785
01:26:05,374 --> 01:26:07,342
I love you, will.

786
01:26:20,222 --> 01:26:21,348
Look at the sky.

787
01:26:24,226 --> 01:26:25,250
Clouds.

788
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:31,156
We feel the ecosystems of the earth.

789
01:26:35,137 --> 01:26:37,230
Molecules to the air.

790
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:40,241
There will be no pollution.

791
01:26:43,179 --> 01:26:46,148
Forests, can grow well.

792
01:26:49,118 --> 01:26:50,278
Water is so pure,

793
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,254
You can drink out of any river.

794
01:26:57,326 --> 01:26:59,191
This is a dream.

795
01:27:00,363 --> 01:27:04,163
He idea is not only to cure a
disease, but also to heal the
planet.

796
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,134
For a better future.

797
01:27:06,135 --> 01:27:07,193
For us all.

798
01:27:27,123 --> 01:27:28,147
Here it is.

799
01:27:29,191 --> 01:27:30,215
Finally.

800
01:27:36,365 --> 01:27:37,354
You alright?

801
01:27:39,201 --> 01:27:40,133
Yes.

802
01:27:55,217 --> 01:27:57,082
They did not kill anybody.

803
01:28:17,139 --> 01:28:18,128
Will.

804
01:28:21,177 --> 01:28:22,269
Is this what you did?

805
01:28:25,381 --> 01:28:27,178
I always did.

806
01:28:31,387 --> 01:28:33,287
Sorry, I do not believe.

807
01:28:47,136 --> 01:28:48,296
Let's go to the park.

808
01:28:50,372 --> 01:28:53,068
Shrine to us.

809
01:29:03,152 --> 01:29:04,278
I'll never let you go.

810
01:30:40,182 --> 01:30:42,241
Viruses that erase everything.

811
01:30:56,131 --> 01:30:58,224
Will, to do good as what they say.

812
01:31:04,173 --> 01:31:06,232
But I knew there was something more.

813
01:31:09,345 --> 01:31:10,334
Sure.

814
01:31:23,092 --> 01:31:26,084
He created this park for the same
reason he created everything.

815
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:36,304
So they could be together.

816
01:31:39,304 --> 01:31:43,304
