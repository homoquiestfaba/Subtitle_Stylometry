Adam! Drinks later, perhaps?

Yeah, that sounds great, Peter.
We'll see you then.

00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,636
Who was that?

5
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,538
That was Lord Fawley.

6
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,473
Seems pleasant.

00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,142
Ha ha. He has to be.

8
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,643
I just acquired 8%
of his stock.

00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,346
He's vulnerable to a takeover.

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,448
Is there anywhere

where you aren't reminded
about business?

12
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,587
Aspen was your idea.

13
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,624
It wasn't criticism,
just a comment.

14
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,325
Yeah, right.

15
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,573
Thank you.

-[man] For what?

34
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,803
[woman] If you ever left
your film lab, you'd know

35
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,573
that the women's ski team
just won the World Cup.

36
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,742
[man] Uh, you know,
we ordered the pork roast

37
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,412
but all they seem to have
is sausage.

38
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:35,648
Don't complain, Tomas.
At least it's meat, maybe.

Are you an actress
as well as a model?

42
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,060
I'm a student and a skier.

43
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,395
I model sometimes
for my expenses.

44
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,763
I'm Mirak Bartos.

45
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:55,301
Everyone at this table knows
who you are, Mr. Bartos.

46
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,870
I'm starting work on a film
here in Prague

47
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,473
and there is a small role
for which

48
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:04,310
you have the perfect look.

49
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:08,414
If you're interested, call me.

50
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,855
Are you going to do it?

51
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,624
I don't know.

52
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,493
Tomas thinks Bartos' movies
are terribly low-brow.

53
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,830
Oh, he made one or two movies,
good ones, early on.

54
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,798
Mirak Bartos' career
was going nowhere

55
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,835
until he married
the daughter of the head
of the secret police.

56
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:32,905
You should do it, Katrinka.
It'll pay better than modeling.

57
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,427
Do you know
how beautiful you are?

58
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,131
I'm glad you think so.

59
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,900
I think you could have
a career in film.

60
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:05,571
Acting is pretending
to be other people.

61
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,442
I'd rather be myself.

62
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,846

I've had no time
to be in love.

Well, I find that
difficult to believe.

67
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,760
It's true. Are you?

68
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,596
What?

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,731
In love.

But, uh, we live
very separate lives.

74
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,384
No.

00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,724

00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,525
I'd like that.

I don't want you to.

You're not very experienced
at this, are you?

81
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,739
I have never made love before.

00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,590

I'm pregnant.

Oh, my God.

87
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,824
Are you sure?

88
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,693
Oh, Katrinka.

89
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,795
Oh, my love.

90
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:46,732
It's going to be all right,
I promise you.

91
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,501
I'll take care of you.

92
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,606
I need a little time.

93
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,642
Don't do anything
until you hear from me.

[Katrinka] Ahh.

96
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,626
I thought you weren't coming.

97

I'm here.

I love you.

100
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,706
You mustn't doubt that.

101
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,776
But I can't leave my wife.

102
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,679
I... I can't destroy
my career.

103
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:37,083
And that's what a divorce
and acknowledging the baby
would mean.

104
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,687
Don't look at me like that,
I'm not abandoning you.

105
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,158
I've made all the arrangements.

106
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,027
I'll come with you.

107
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,862
Arrangements for what?

108
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,866
An abortion.

109
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,836
I don't want an abortion.

110
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,706
I want my baby.
I want to keep my baby.

111
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,941
You can't mean that.

112
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,109
I do mean it.

113
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,780
You'll lose your place
on the team.

114
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,882
Your government stipend.

115
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,851
You won't be able
to finish university.

116
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,389

going to support a child?!

117

Because you can't let yourself
be that angry at me?

124
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,991
I could never be
that angry with you.

125

I only want the best
in this world for you.

126

Because that's what
you deserve.

127

Mirak Bartos is not the best.

128
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,569
Mirak is no longer
a part of my life.

This baby is.

130
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,645
I want to keep it.

131
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,082
And to love it
the way you love me.

132
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,653
I don't want to be angry, Papa.

133
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,056
Or bitter.

I just want to go on
and do the best I can.

135
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:32,865
How can...
How can we possibly manage?

136
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:36,168
I'll finish this term
at the university.

137
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,871
I'll continue to train
with the team.

138
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,173
No one need know
I'm pregnant.

139
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,977
Mirak has arranged
a travel visa for me in June,

140
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,147
so I can go to Munich.

141
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,683
But what then?

142
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:57,256
No one must know
but I'll stay in Munich.

143
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,126
I'll defect.

144
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,894
[Milena] Katrinka!

145
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,967
We'll never see you again.

146
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,803
You will, Mama.

147
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,773
Things have to change.

148
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,841
Freedom will come someday.

149
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,277
At least in Munich,
I can find work

150
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,212
and support myself
and my child.

151
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,751
I'm sorry to have done this
to you.

152
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,893
We love you, Katrinka.

153
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,834
[distant bells ringing]

154
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,944
This will be your room.

155
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,946
Your board has been paid
through October,

156
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:57,316
and all the arrangements have
been made with Dr. Zimmerman.

157
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,254
Katrinka?

158
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,325
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,261
It's lovely.

160
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,131
I was just thinking how...

161
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:16,869
this is the first time
I've been anywhere, just me.

162
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:22,141
Not as a member of the team
or my parents' daughter.

163
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,276
Just Katrinka.

164
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,078
Well, you're not alone.

165
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,914
You're very kind.

166
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,383
Have you worked long
for Dr. Zimmerman?

167
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,020
Ten years.
He's a marvelous doctor.

168
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:38,023
And he completely understands
your situation.

169
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,060
I admire your conviction
and your courage.

170
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,931
But... for your baby's sake...

171
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,901
as well as your own...

172
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,137
allow me to arrange
an adoption.

173
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,305
No. No.

174
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,107
I thank you, but no.

175
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:59,078
[Zimmerman] I urge you
at least to consider adoption.

176
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,180
You want every advantage
for your baby.

177
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:06,285
A child needs a father, family.

178
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,053
Real security.

179
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,189
My child has a father

180
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,858
who would not accept
responsibility.

181
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,094
I will.

182
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,129
Thank you, Dr. Zimmerman.

183
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,032
[door opens]

184
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,435
See you later, Erica.

185
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,371
[telephone ringing]

186
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,944
[Erica] Hello?

187
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,847
Hold on a minute,
I'll get her.

188
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,320
Katrinka, there's someone
called Tomas for you

189
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,988
on the telephone.

190
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:49,328
If he's calling drunk
from a party to tell me....

191
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,463
film is the voice of freedom...

192
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,332
[Erica chuckles]

193
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,170
Tomas.

194
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,439
Do you know what time it is?

195
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,176
No.

196
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,146
No, tell me.

197
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,887
I understand.

198
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,224
Thank you.

199
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,495
Erica!

200
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,998
[Erica] What's happened?

201
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,167
My parents.

202
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,902
In the mountains.

203
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,140
There was a convoy
of Russian tanks.

204
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:38,510
My parents' car
went off the road.

205
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,145
They're dead.

206
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,382
-Oh, Katrinka!
-My parents are dead!

207
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,235
[groaning]

208
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,316
[Katrinka] Baby.

209
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,351
You're so cute.

210
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:23,155
Yes, you have beautiful eyes.

211
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:30,062
[Zimmerman] Listen to me now,
Katrinka.

212
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,497
Your parents are gone.

213
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,167
There's no one
you can depend upon.

214
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,536
There is no question but that
you must go home

215
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,571
for the funeral.

216
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,107
But how can you
come back to Munich?

217
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,045
And if you take
the baby with you,

218
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,148
neither of you may ever
come back again.

219
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:53,218
You know the life that faces you
as an unwed mother?

220
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:57,589
Even more painful now without
the support of your parents.

221
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,225
I don't know what to do.

222
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,262
Allow me to arrange
an immediate adoption.

223
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,265
I know a young couple.

224
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:10,102
They're educated, wealthy.

225
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,537
And loving.

226
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,606
But how?

227
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,343
Sign the release form.

228
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:24,450
Then your son will be
safe and secure and...

229
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,120
in his own room tonight,
with a mother and father

230
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,589
prepared to devote a lifetime
to loving him.

231
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,569
It is the responsible thing
to do for your little boy.

232
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,608
[baby crying]

233
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,129
Mrs. Graham, I had a call
from Paris.

234
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,697
The gentleman said it's
regarding a Renoir painting

235
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,666
he's been trying to find
for you.

236
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,170
Thank you, Carter.
Mr. Graham will be an hour late.

237
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,238
I'm afraid dinner plans
are uncertain.

238
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,107
I'm prepared
for any eventuality.

239
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,278
[phone autodials]

240
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,614
Paul Zeiss.

241
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,217
Mr. Zeiss, Katrinka Graham.

242
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,319
Have you found my son?

243
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,457
I regret that my report
is the usual one.

244
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,327
We have found no trace
of male child Kovar
born October 7,

245
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,728
1970.

246
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,164
Shall we continue the search?

247
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,133
Yes, please.

248
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,711
[man] ...rest in peace
with the Lord.

249
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,646
Perpetual light shine
upon thee.

250
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,381
Amen.

251
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,430
Mirak.

252
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,367
I want to go back to Munich.

253
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,537
I want to find my son
and make a life away from here.

254
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,405
You want to defect.

255
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,341
Yes.

256
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,676
[Mirak] I can't help you,
Katrinka.

257
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,645
Or rather I won't help you.

258
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,580
[Katrinka] Why not?

259
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,682
Because your decision
was the right one.

260
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,518
For you and the child.

261
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,690
I feel as if there's nothing
left for me in Czechoslovakia.

262
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,560
But what about
an Olympic gold medal?

263
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,729
That's what you've
been training for.

264
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,331
That's what everyone says
you're going to win.

265
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,401
Where does Austria begin?

266
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,236
[Susannah] Below the right fork.

267
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,806
About 100 yards
beyond the last line of trees.

268
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,647
You know, I heard
that in the '64 Olympics,

269
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,716
the Russians were training here.

270
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,819
One of them tried to defect.

271
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,390
Broke his neck trying to make
that run at night,

272
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,624
under a full moon.

273
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,828
[sighs]

274
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,465
Come on, the coach
is waiting for us.

275
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,649
-[woman] Watch for ice.
-Susannah?

276
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,817
Go!

277
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,629
[exhales]

278
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,320
Go!

279
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,502
-Katrinka!
-I can catch her!

280
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,669
[door buzzes]

281
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,007
Katrinka! I'm so happy
you're safe

282
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,744
and that you called me.

283
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:02,514
If I can stay with you for a few
days till I find my own place?

284
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,915
Of course you may.

285
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,685
I'll get my old job back
at the hotel

286
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,454
until I can
reestablish myself modeling.

287
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,723
It won't take you long, I know.

288
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,760
But first and beyond anything,
I want my son.

289
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:19,631
Katrinka, your son is with
loving and very wealthy people.

290
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,933
I don't know
who they are or where.

291
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:25,003
And Dr. Zimmerman has
instructed me to tell you

292
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:29,674
that he will not see you,
nor will he accept your calls.

293
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,716
[woman] Come on, girls,
ten minutes till showtime.

294
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,858
Oh, yes. Marvelous.

295
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,560
[man] Turn around, my dear.

296
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,829
Now, tell the truth,
did they sew you into it?

297
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,898
-Yes.
-Can you sit down in it?

298
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,766
Not on your life.

299
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,835
-[Natalie chuckles]
-Here you are, my dear.

300
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,771
You look wonderful.
Good luck.

301
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,740
[whistle blows]

302
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:06,978
Arggh!

303
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,747
-Hi!
-Hi.

304
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,949
Are all these people
waiting for taxis?

305
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,018
Yes, it's totally impossible.

306
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,854
I'm Natalie Bovier, head buyer
for Galleries Gillette.

307
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,589
I'm Katrinka Kovar.

308
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,925
Come have a drink with me
until this thins out.

309
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,493
I would love to.

310
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,567
[speaks German]

311
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,571
Oh, Natalie, I shall be back
at the hotel at 7:00.

312
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:33,939
I'll be there.

313
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,315
That was Jean-Claude Gillette.

314
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:44,783
Himself.

315
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,885
He's incredibly attractive.

316
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,554
I agree.

317
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,022
We're lovers.

318
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,058
He's married
and it's hideous, but...

319
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,759
I adore him.

320
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,762
I know the pain involved
with loving a married man.

321
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,764
Who was he?

322
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,566
Film director in Prague.

323
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,335
[Natalie] You must have been
a child.

324
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,136
In many ways.

325
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,105
-Are you in love now?
-Yes.

326
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,107
But not with a man,
with a place.

327
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,643
-Oh, really.
-It's called the Golden Horn.

328
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,144
[Natalie]
That charming guesthouse?

329
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,113
I know it; I've been
to Kitzbuhel with Jean-Claude.

330
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:18,049
It's owned right now
by this marvelous old couple

331
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,785
who've promised to sell it to me
and stay on as managers.

332
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,954
Well, aren't you
the clever girl.

333
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:26,658
-Do you ski?
-Mm. After a fashion.

334
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,126
Well, when the Golden Horn
is mine,

335
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,762
you must come as my guest
and I'll give you lessons.

336
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,697
Oh, I'll look forward to that.

337
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,067
You wanna marry?

338
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,069
Absolutely.

339
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:41,139
After a grand
and passionate romance.

340
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:44,843
He'll be full of life and energy
and want to accomplish things.

341
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,613
He needn't be rich,
although I wouldn't object.

342
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:52,150
He'll want to laugh
and to dance and to ski.

343
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,619
He needn't be handsome,

344
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,689
but he should be
incredibly sexy.

345
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,759
And he has to love me
desperately.

346
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:03,728
Whoever he is,
I hope I meet him soon.

347
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:07,165
Well, whoever he is,
I hope you do too.

348
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,934
[Katrinka laughs]

349
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,874
[indistinct conversation]

350
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,751
[doorbell jingles]

351
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,753
-Hello, Karl.
-Good afternoon, Miss Kovar.

352
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,855
We're fully booked
for the weekend.

353
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:34,125
Oh, good. If this keeps up,
I can stop modeling
and just move in.

354
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,194
-Is Natalie upstairs?
-Miss Bovier is shopping.

355
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,996
She said she will meet you
for dinner.

356
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,965
[man] We can't wait,
my darling.

357
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:43,001
Before the clock strikes,
the big hand has to move here,

358
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,904
and we have to meet Mama
at the hotel, OK?

359
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,006
-Come on, you.
-We can solve that problem.

360
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,842
Oh, no, mustn't touch.

361
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,677
You're absolutely right,
but in this case I can,

362
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,046
because it's my guesthouse
and it's my cuckoo clock

363
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,781
and I wanted to enjoy it.

364
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,683
That's very kind of you.

365
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:01,653
-My pleasure. May I pick you up?
-[boy] Yeah.

366
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,956
What a big boy you are.

367
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,658
Oh!

368
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:09,861
[cuckoo calls]

369
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:13,231
[boy] Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

370
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,700
-[cuckoo calls]
-There you go.

371
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,737
-Whaddya say?
-[children] Thank you!

372
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,271
You're welcome.
Come back soon?

373
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,707
-Yes.
-OK.

374
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,143
[man] You have a devoted
clientele for life.

375
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,045
They're absolutely a delight.

376
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,913
[man] See you again.

377
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,248
Bye now.

378
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:33,151
-Bye.
-[boy humming]

379
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,854
[man] Come on. Come on.

380
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,131
[man] Come along.

381
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,733
[woman] Miss Kovar?

382
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,168
-[Katrinka] Yeah.
-The Hellers.

383
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,971
We stayed with you in December.

384
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,172
Of course.

385
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,007
Good to see you again.

386
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,942
-Auf Wiedersehen.
-Auf Wiedersehen.

387
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,115
-Bella donna! 
-[Katrinka] Alberto!

388
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,984
Bella figura!

389
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,153
[chuckles]

390
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,827
[man] I hate to bother you,
Miss Kovar,

391
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,329
but I just wanted
to introduce myself.
I'm Adam Graham.

392
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,232
[Katrinka] How do you do?
How did you know my name?

393
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,967
[Adam] I was eavesdropping
in line.

394
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:26,171
[Katrinka] It's Katrinka Kovar.
Katrinka to my friends.

395
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,873
[Adam] You sure seem to have
a lot of friends up here.

396
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,842
[Katrinka] I own
a small guesthouse.

397
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,211
-The Golden Horn?
-Oh, I know the Golden Horn.

398
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:36,081
It's a charming place.
Just like its owner.

399
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,183
Yes. It is nice.

400
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,919
I know, I know,
that was a lousy line.

401
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,821
I get stupid
around beautiful women.

402
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:45,824
You seem quite composed
to me, Mr. Graham.

403
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:54,032
I'm, uh... kind of
on unfamiliar ground here.

404
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,900
Why do I doubt that?

405
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,870
[chuckles] No, I mean, I've
never skied this trail before.

406
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,338
[Katrinka] It's fast
at the beginning.

407
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:03,174
-I like fast.
-I don't doubt that.

408
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,243
You cold?

409
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,846
I don't wear much
under my suit.

410
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,982
I'll hold the thought.

411
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,817
[Katrinka] I'll be fine
once I'm moving.

412
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,352
Wait a second. Wh...

413
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,222
Where are you going, Miss...

414
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,061
Well, damn.

415
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:30,168
This woman at the table
to the left of you
has been staring at you.

416
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,370
Mm. Sabrina.
I saw her on the way in.

417
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,972
[Katrinka] Who is she?

418
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:36,074
Gossip columnist
based in New York.

419
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,176
Internationally syndicated.

420
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:41,913
Mean as a snake,
but very amusing.

421
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,348
I'm rather fond of her.

422
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:46,184
She's run a couple of items
about Jean-Claude and me.

423
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,286
[chuckles] His wife was furious.

424
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,188
[man] Adam.

425
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,227
The couples at the door?

426
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,196
[Natalie] Mark von Hollen
and his wife Lisa.

427
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:01,199
He's a newspaper publisher,
New York and London.

428
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,101
They're devoted to one another.

429
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:07,038
Word has it
he's even faithful to her.

430
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:10,108
He was at the Golden Horn
this afternoon
with his children.

431
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,411
Who's the other one?

432
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,113
[Natalie] I haven't a clue.

433
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,881
Stunning woman.

434
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,850
Isn't she?

435
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,990
Uh-huh!

436
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,425
No "uh-huh."

437
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,461
We had a brief conversation
on the slopes, and he's...

438
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,198
obviously unavailable.

439
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,332
[Natalie sighs]

440
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,940
For Miss Kovar.

441
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,007
Thank you.

442
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,062
[horn honks, tires screech]

443
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:13,972
[knock on door]

444
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,448
Mr. Graham.

445
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,416
Miss Kovar.

446
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,486
I, uh, convinced them
at the Golden Horn

447
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,989
to give me
your address in Munich.

448
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,091
That was very enterprising
of you.

449
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,159
I guess you'd better come in.

450
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,262
No, that's OK. These...
These are for you.

451
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,197
Oh, they're beautiful.

452
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,032
Thank you.

453
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,367
I, uh...

454
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,303
Will you have dinner
with me tonight?

455
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:50,141
Uh... but the lovely lady
at the Excelsior.

456
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,010
Lucia di Campo?

457
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:56,314
Uh... business associate
and my lawyer's wife.

458
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,750
I'd be delighted
to have dinner with you.

459
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,451
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

460
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,187
Maybe you'll show me
the apartment after dinner.

461
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:11,229
My father's the ninth
generation of ship builders

462
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,365
and yachtsmen, out of Newport.

463
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,068
I have three commercial yards
of my own, too,
on the East Coast.

464
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,770
One in Washington state.

465
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,339
That's my resume, basically.

466
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,540
Uh...

467
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:24,475
I'm off tomorrow morning
to negotiate

468
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,177
for a yard in Breman.

469
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,346
What kind of ships do you build?

470
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,348
What kind do you want?

471
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,087
Everybody thinks I'm crazy
to expand into Europe

472
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,555
in the middle of
an economic slump,

473
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,491
but now is the time.

474
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,360
Tell me why.

475
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:45,363
So I'll be ready when things
turn around, which they will.

476
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,234
Wanna hear more
about your escape.

477
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,203
Oh, there's nothing to tell.

478
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:56,607
A new life was possible if I did
what I had to do, so I did it.

479
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,409
You make it sound so simple.

480
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,213
No.

481
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,082
There was loss.

482
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,550
And pain, but...

483
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,586
in the end,
the choice was clear.

484
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:13,057
So, I imagine, was the risk.

485
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,394
Yes.

486
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:19,530
But... next to skiing
and good champagne,

487
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,566
I love adrenaline.

488
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,305
So, how about buying
the Golden Horn,

489
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,506
was that a risk?

490
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:31,609
No, that was security.

491
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,578
And joy.

492
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:38,316
Come stay with us next time,
when you're in Kitzbuhel.

493
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,419
Unless, of course, you need
to spend a lot of money
at the Excelsior

494
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:44,355
to prove you're having fun.

495
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,290
Do you object to spending money?

496
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:49,627
No. No, just to wasting money.

497
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,664
To wasting anything, really.

498
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,100
Time.

499
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,403
Knowledge.

500
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,139
Experiences.

501
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,441
Or the opportunity for romance.

502
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,347
That too.

503
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:20,191
[woman] We'll be home
in just a minute.

504
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,463
[child whines]

505
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,172
It was a splendid evening.

506
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,240
You're wonderful company.

507
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,211
You're not inviting me in.

508
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,312
I'm not.

509
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,281
[chuckles]

510
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:46,551
I might suggest that
this is a wasted opportunity.

511
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,719
I have an early call
in the morning

512
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,588
and you have a flight to Breman.

513
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,192
Good night.

514
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,660
Good night.

515
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,709
Good night.

516
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,595
[telephone rings]

517
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,299
Hello.

518
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,302
You're there. I've been calling
all day. Where have you been?

519
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:41,239
-Do you have your shipyard?
-[Adam]
It's too soon to tell.

520
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,974
But... listen, one way
or the other,

521
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,609
I'm gonna be in Munich
tomorrow night.

522
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,410
Where would you like
to have dinner?

523
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,579
I'm driving to Kitzbuhel
tomorrow afternoon.

524
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:51,782
No, you're not.
You're staying in Munich
and having dinner with me.

525
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,986
You're not the only one
with business to take care of,
Mr. Graham.

526
00:35:55,019 --> 00:36:00,291
Look, have dinner
with me in Munich and...

527
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,426
I'll go out to the Golden Horn
with you Friday.

528
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,761
And stay the weekend?

529
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,530
I can't.

530
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,665
-Oh...
-But I will.

531
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,668
[chuckles]
You have a deal, Mr. Graham.

532
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,371
Good night.

533

I want to share his life.
I want to live in America.

It feels like
the greatest adventure.

But if I leave Munich,

[Erica] Have you told Adam
about him?

560

No.

561
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:39,483
If he's well and happy,
I can't disrupt his life.

562
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,721
Katrinka, if I could have
helped you,

563
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:45,723
I would have done so
long ago.

564

be anywhere in the world.

Oh, yeah.

You can invite Natalie in

But what about your parents?

581
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,749
They're on that cruise
in the Mediterranean.

582
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:47,518
Whatever we do will be fine
with my father.

583

And whatever we do will not
be fine with my mother.

584
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:54,725
So... we only
have to please ourselves.

585

It would please me very much
to marry you next week
in Malibu.

-[woman] Katrinka.

708
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,325
-Oh, excuse me.
-Of course.

709
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:36,360
[Katrinka] Natalie!

710
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,198
Have you recovered
from the honeymoon?

711
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:42,399
-Mm-hmm.
-Are you happy?

712
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,334
-Mm-hmm.
-You look wonderful.

713
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:48,639
-I'm pregnant.
-That is the best news. Mwah!

714
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:50,440
Khalid, congratulations.

715
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,210
Thank you.
You are the first to know.

716
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:57,047
Now all I need in this life
is a three-hour lunch with you.

717
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,882
Tomorrow.

718
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:01,218
Here comes Carlos.

719
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,920
I'll go find Adam.

720
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:05,989
♪ When I was sure... 

721
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:09,459
Katrinka, it's a grand slam.
Congratulations.

722
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,962
It's amazing what money
can buy, isn't it?

723
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,430
[Lucia] Adam, you beast.

724
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,099
Katrinka's worked herself
to death for months over this.

725
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,935
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

726
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,236
He's never ashamed of himself.

727
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,238
It's one of the things
I love best about him.

728
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:24,007
-Come, let's go find Natalie.
-Excuse me.

729
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,910
I could strangle him.

730
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,114
Wasn't it great
Natalie could come?

731
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,983
-Mm.
-She says Khalid's

732
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,252
so protective, she feels like
she's under house arrest.

733
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:39,189
Oh, come on, Natalie knew
what she was getting into
when she married Khalid.

734
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,024
Well, she knew
but she didn't know.

735
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,893
But she's thrilled
about the baby.

736
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,431
I want to have a baby.

737
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,099
Oh, God.

738
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,301
Yeah, yeah.

739
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,138
We've got two whole weeks
in Paris.

740
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,441
Wouldn't it be great
to conceive a child in Paris?

741
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,077
Oh, sure, but, uh...

742
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,279
let's try for Manhattan.

743
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:10,420
[Adam] Sure. How soon?
You got it.

744
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:14,157
-Merci beaucoup, garçon.
-All right.

745
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,293
All right, my friend.
I look forward to it.

746
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,028
Be well. Bye.

747
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,496
Ho!

748

[sighs]

749
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:28,939
I just told Mike I'm in
the market for a film studio.

750
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,149
Adam, that's such
an unpredictable business.

751
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:44,488
-What do you know about it?
-As much as you do.

752
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:46,456
Maybe more.

753
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,359
Really?

754
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:52,062
Why? Because you got
a bit part in a movie

755
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,197
and slept with the director?

756
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,003
No. Because I talk
to your Hollywood friends,

757
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,405
I read the
Wall Street Journal.

758
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,074
You can win a fortune,
but you can lose, too.

759
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:07,311
Are you worried that
your standard of living
might be reduced?

760
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:11,348
What a mean
and stupid thing to say.

761
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:12,783
[phone dialing]

762
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:15,085
You talk to me about
your deals all the time.

763
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,020
You claim you value
my opinion...

764
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:19,990
but apparently that's only
when I agree with you.

765
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:28,799
[Katrinka] Excuse me,
can you help me?

766
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,500
I'm looking
for Rue St. Lazare.

767
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,369
Of course, dear,
it's quite simple.

768
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:35,305
You go two blocks down
on Boulevard Montmartre,

769
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,140
make a right turn,
and you'll be there.

770
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:39,609
-Thank you so much.
-Not at all.

771
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,115
Miss Kovar, Mr. Zeiss.

772
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:48,552
A pleasure.
Won't you be seated?

773
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:55,125
Your ad says
you trace missing persons.

774
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,294
Lost heirs, usually.

775
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,262
Kidnapped children
and adults.

776
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,398
There's someone
I want you to find

777
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:03,500
under conditions
of confidentiality

778
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,235
and the utmost discretion.

779
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:07,838
And the person is?

780
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:10,073
My son.

781
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,454
[humming]

782
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:31,228
[sighs] Sad news this morning.

783
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:33,497
Mark von Hollen's wife
and family

784
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,632
died in a fire last night
in Connecticut.

785
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,868
No.

786
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:40,303
[Adam] Yeah, house burned
to the ground in the night.

787
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:41,638
He was in London.

788
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,211
To lose your family...

789
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:55,552
Your children.

790
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,100
Oh, God.

791
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,372
Look, I'll have
the office send flowers.

792
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,441
You need
to pull yourself together

793
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:20,610
if we're going to go look
at this potential investment
of yours.

794
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,446
I have to be downtown at 10:00.

795
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,284
I'll be in the car.

796
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,696
[Adam] Wow!

797
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,232
I used to come to this place
when I was a kid.

798
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,935
It was such a great hotel.

799
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:48,338
[Katrinka] So,
what do you think?

800
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,240
[Adam] Uh...

801
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,576
Let me see your figures again.

802
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:01,685
Let's see...

803
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,629
Well, I think...

804
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:16,199
you should buy it.

805
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:21,238
It's such a gamble.

806
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,273
[Adam] The greater the risk,
the greater the fun.

807
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,742
Champagne and adrenaline,
remember?

808
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:30,280
Hey, if it doesn't work,
I'm rich enough for both of us.

809
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,749
Listen.

810
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:35,719
Next year,
I'm gonna be up to my ears
learning the film business.

811
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:39,322
It would be great for you
to have a chance like this
to occupy yourself.

812
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:43,727
What if I get pregnant?

813
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,735
That doesn't seem
to be happening, does it?

814
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:57,774
[sighs] Maybe if we both stop
thinking about it, it will.

815
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:02,212
Hey... do this.
I'm behind you all the way.

816
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:09,686
[telephone rings]

817
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,688
-Hello?
-[Paul]
Mrs. Graham.

818
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:14,324
-Paul Zeiss.
-Yes, Mr. Zeiss.

819
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,593
I'm afraid I have
nothing new to report.

820
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:19,462
And truthfully,
I feel a little guilty.

821
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:22,599
Not that I don't appreciate
your handsome retainer, but...

822
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:25,402
-you want to go on with this?
-Yes.

823
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,470
May I ask why
after all this time?

824
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,372
'Cause no matter
where I've been

825
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:31,775
and what I've done,
no day has gone by

826
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:35,278
when I haven't wondered
if my son is well

827
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,513
and safe and loved.

828
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:39,516
I understand.
We'll persevere.

829
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,284
Thank you.

830
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,724
[Adam] So, do I get to go home
with you tonight?

831
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,326
-I hope so.
-Yeah.

832
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,362
-Oh, this is a triumph!
-Hey, Carlos.

833
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,564
For you and for
the children of the streets.

834
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,666
Carlos, who needs more help
than a child?

835
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,368
Exactly.

836
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,537
-Where is Natalie?
-I don't know.

837
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,739
Let's go find her. Adam?

838
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:04,841
I'm just gonna say hi
to the Warner Bros. people.

839
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,476
There you are.

840
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,511
Try and get a moment alone
with Natalie.

841
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:11,448
-I think something's wrong.
-Like what?

842
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,717
I don't know, but she's
not acting herself.

843
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,852
Katrinka, isn't that
Mark von Hollen?

844
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,787
No one's seen him in ages.

845
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:19,789
-Excuse me?
-OK.

846
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,725
I love what you've done
with the place.

847
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,760
-It's absolutely beautiful.
-I know.

848
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:27,330
Mark, I've thought
of you so often.

849
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,636
I kept your letter.

850
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:36,406
It was enormous help. Um...

851
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,575
I didn't know you lost
your parents under
those circumstances.

852
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,809
I'm sorry.

853
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,812
I never thought
I'd get over it.

854
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:46,516
It's taken me a long time
to want a life without Lisa

855
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:48,418
and the children.

856
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,889
But I think I'm back now.

857
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,891
And thank you
for your invitation.

858
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,527
I'm just pleased
you could make it.

859
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,465
Have you seen Adam?

860
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:03,700
[Mark] I'm on my way.

861
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,505
Save me a dance.

862
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,907
Absolutely.

863
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,876

[Katrinka] Natalie.

865
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:22,485
Khalid has declared the Cyril
his favorite New York hotel.

866
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:24,654
We designed the penthouse
with him in mind.

867
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:27,957
[Natalie] This is spectacular.
I'm so thrilled for you.

868
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,360
Darling, are you all right?

869
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:35,865
-Not exactly.
-Can we have some time together?

870
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:38,902
Hmm-mm, not this trip.
We're flying back
to Riyadh tomorrow.

871
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:42,772
-Katrinka.
-Sabrina.

873
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:47,877
Hello, Sabrina.

874
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:51,648
So, what do you think
of the Cyril?

875
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:55,418
I am trying desperately
to find something to criticize.

876
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,187
-[Natalie giggles]
-Thank you, Sabrina.

877
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,621
I think.

878

-Excuse me.
-Certainly.

879
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:04,494
Natalie. Tell me something.

880
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,496
Mm, that could be dangerous.

881
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,864
This is off the record.

882
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:10,567
Now, take a look at Mr. Graham.

883
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,870
Could it be the great one

884
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:17,006
is a little upstaged
by his wife?

885
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,878
[Sabrina chuckles]

886
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,689
Ah, that was wonderful.

887
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,828
It was great.

888
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:40,930
Yes.

889
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:42,532
Adam.

890
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,672
You're angry.

891
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:50,974
Come on, I'm tired.

892
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,614
Of course you are, you've been
working nonstop for months.

893
00:56:57,647 --> 00:56:59,048
Something happen tonight?

894
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,953
You opened New York's
premier luxury hotel.

895
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,722
No, besides that.

896
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,590
No, nothing happened.

897
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,828
I have a suggestion to make.

898
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:17,000
Could you and I simply
go somewhere and...

899
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:18,835
spend some time together?

900
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:20,870
Where would you like to go?

901
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:23,540
I always want to go
to the Golden Horn.

902
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:26,075
[scoffs] Why do you
hold onto that place?

903
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,877
It's barely breaking even.

904
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:31,881
[Katrinka] I couldn't
give it up, it's part of me.

905
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:34,050
It's a rational
business decision.

906
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,052
-Hey, what is this?
-Come on, Katrinka.

907
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,588
I can't just pick up
and go to the Alps.

908
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,056
I have to be in London
on Monday.

909
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,792
And I have a hotel to run,
but couldn't we just

910
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,894
take off for a few days
and just...

911
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,596
What?

912
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,832
I was gonna say
"and love one another."

913
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:53,536
What does that mean?

914
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,672
To share things again.

915
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:57,941
To feel that...

916
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:02,779
life together is more fun
than when we're apart.

917
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:06,049
Is it?

918
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:09,986
I've tried
to make you proud of me.

919
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:14,757
I've tried to live up to
the role of Adam Graham's wife

920
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,594
and I've learned so much
about myself

921
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,596
that I wouldn't have known
otherwise.

922
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:22,665
Which has been
one of your great gifts to me.

923
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,603
But if I'm losing you
in the process,

924
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:28,104
it seems like
a very stupid exercise.

925
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,006
No, no, no, no, look at me.

926
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:32,108
You're not gonna make me
the heavy just because

927
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,644
I'm married to a woman
who wants to have everything

928
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:37,146
but can't accept the
consequences of her own actions.

929
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,582
You wanted it.

930
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,851
You wanted me to fill up
my time

931
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:46,856
so you could devote 24 hours
a day to your movie studio.

932
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,959
Well, you have your studio
and you have your shipyards,

933
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,795
and I hope to God they've
been keeping you warm at night

934
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:54,931
because I certainly haven't
had that opportunity.

935
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:58,968
Well, I'll call
your private secretary
and I'll make an appointment.

936
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:01,604
Maybe I've done too much,
is that it?

937
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:04,173
And you can't handle it because
you need to be the star.

938
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,110
Yeah. Yeah.

939
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:09,679
[Katrinka] I don't want
to compete with you.

940
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,681
I want to love you.

941
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,850
And if that's no longer
of interest,

942
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,718
you just better tell me now.

943
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:21,824
I don't wanna do this.

944
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,661
Let's go to Aspen
before we go to London.

945
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:45,048
You have dinner yet?

946
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,649
[Adam groans]

947
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,217
Yeah, at the bar.

948
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:53,790
Did you have a good run?

949
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,227
No.

950
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,679
Nothing seems very good
anymore, does it?

951
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:30,026
I've tried, we've both tried
over the past years, but...

952
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,761
Are you as lonely as I am?

953
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:32,962
Apparently not.

954
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:38,034
What the hell do you want,
Katrinka?

955
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:39,202
[tosses boot]

956
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:40,837
More than we have.

957
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:44,941
Well, I'm sorry
all this is so inadequate.

958
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,245
I should have said,
"I want you."

959
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:52,015
I'm not so sure
you know who I am.

960
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:54,884
Oh...

961
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,953
Can we just table all this, OK?

962
01:00:56,986 --> 01:01:00,156
I got calls to make and we have
an early flight to London.

963
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,192
Certainly.

964
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:16,906
[door closes]

965
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:39,128
Tell him
it was their proposal.

966
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:42,265
I approved it,
and they're stuck with it.

967
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:45,902
Good.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

968
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:48,237
-[hangs up phone]
-Sorry, static
on the print campaign.

969
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:50,873
We were due at Cheyne Walk
seven minutes ago.

970
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,843
[Katrinka] Adam, I'm in London
because you wanted me to be.

971
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:57,046
That doesn't mean everything
in New York came to a stop.

972
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,881
-How do I look?
-You look great.

973
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:02,118
You're the man who spent 2/3
of every vacation on the phone.

974
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:05,922
You got to say what you have
to say and get the hell off.

975
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:09,125
Natalie and Khalid will forgive
us for being 20 minutes late.

976
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:11,260
I got important business
with at least four people

977
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:14,097
who are gonna be at this thing.
Can we just get going?

978
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:16,933
How can you criticize me
for taking care of my business

979
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:20,036
when everything in your life,
including lunch
with old friends,

980
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,138
is just another chance
to cut a deal?

981
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,108
[door opens]

982
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:30,279
[indistinct conversation]

983
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,849
[woman] Mrs. Graham?

984
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:36,352
Trudy Heller. We used to stay
with you at the Golden Horn.

985
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:39,155
My husband Claus
and son Christian.

986
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:42,925
Of course.
How lovely to meet you again.

987
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:45,094
Christian, I remember you
from the bunny slopes.

988
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:46,896
Oh, yes, me too.

989
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:50,366
Adam. Adam,
do you know the Hellers?

990
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:54,070
Sure. Didn't we meet
at the conference in Zurich?

991
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,139
-[Natalie] Food, everyone.
-[Adam] Hello, Christian.

992
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:59,275
-How do you do, sir?
-We don't want the caviar
to get hot.

993
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:03,846
Excuse me.
Katrinka, cherie,

994
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,882
I must take you away
for a moment.

995
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:09,852
I want to show you my new
armoire in the bedroom. Come.

996
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:12,088
You won't believe it.
It was a bargain.

997
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,856
Aziz is very social.

998
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,358
[Aziz] A bargain.

999
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,262
You can't believe it.

1000
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,897
It was a bargain.

1001
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,204
I want to leave Khalid.

1002
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:31,140
-Natalie!
-I can't go back to Riyadh.

1003
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:34,410
It was bearable when we were
spending time in New York
and London,

1004
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,980
but now Khalid stays home
all the time because
of the political situation.

1005
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:40,883
I can't stand one more day
of confinement in the palace.

1006
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:43,219
I can't go out alone, I have
to wear the veil in public.

1007
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:45,421
And I can't stand
the first wife.

1008
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:47,323
Does Khalid know how you feel?

1009
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:50,193
Yes.

1010
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:53,196
I still love him
and he loves me.

1011
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:56,966
But he says, if I try to go,
he won't let me take Aziz.

1012
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,268
I can't imagine my life
without my son.

1013
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:03,239
My only hope is to get us both
to America.

1014
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:05,274
Please.

1015
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:07,243
Please, help me.

1016
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,347
I'd like to have your impression
of this one, too.

1017
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,915
[telephone rings]

1018
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,952
And, uh, I want
to show you this one.

1019
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:19,956
-Hello,
oui? 
-You'll have a look later.

1020
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:23,125
Yes,
merci.
 Just a moment,
please, I'm sorry.

1021
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,694
Oh, Katrinka.

1022
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:26,495
We need your plane
at Heathrow on Thursday

1023
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,998
to take Natalie and Aziz to LA.

1024
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,700
Well, that's easily arranged.

1025
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:32,301
Um... tell Natalie

1026
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:35,171
I'm delighted she finally
came back to her senses.

1027
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:39,075
The last thing she needs
to hear right now, Jean-Claude,
is "I told you so."

1028
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:41,277
But she'll be very grateful
and so am I.

1029
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,346
Just let me know when you're
ready to leave Adam.

1030
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,014
[Katrinka]
Spare me your nonsense.

1031
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,516
-Promise me you'll be there.
-Yes.

1032
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,719
You can depend on it.
Bye-bye.

1033
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:51,487
[click]

1034
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,457
This is the important jewelry.

1035
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:57,326
This box is ready.

1036
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,063
-Passports.
-I'll have them with me.

1037
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,201
-How dependable is the nanny?
-Oh, completely.

1038
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,503
She'll have Aziz at the Gardens
at 1:00 sharp.

1039
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:09,505
Perfect. Whew!

1040
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,211
-Hello.
-Katrinka.

1041
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,447
I was trying to lure your wife
into a shopping spree at Harrods

1042
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:21,317
-but she's been virtuous.
-Oh, that's completely
out of character.

1043
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,387
And then some.
I'll just return these for her.

1044
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,089
Just one moment.

1045
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:29,358
Amal, Jelle.

1046
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:35,197
Take these boxes down
to Mrs. Graham's car, please.

1047
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:38,567
I'll see you Thursday
at the fox hunt.

1048
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:43,172
I have a treat for you,
a marvelous mare
I just bought in Ireland.

1049
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:45,574
-I can't wait to meet her.
-Thank you, Katrinka.

1050
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,410
I love you.

1051
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:54,550
[indistinct conversation]

1052
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:57,019
[hounds barking,
horses neighing]

1053
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:59,188
-[Adam] Khalid.
-[Khalid] Adam.

1054
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:02,558
[Khalid] Jelle, make sure
I have blankets for him
when I come back.

1055
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:05,061
Whaddya say?

1056
01:06:05,094 --> 01:06:06,495
Katrinka.

1057
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:09,031
How do you like her?

1058
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:11,100
She's magnificent.

1059
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,501
[Khalid] She is.

1060
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:14,470
[blowing horn]

1061
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:17,473
Well, we're off on time.

1062
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:19,575
They'll pick up the scent
quickly in this weather.

1063
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,177
Go ahead.

1064
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:31,620
Who described this
as "the unspeakable
in pursuit of the inedible"?

1065
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,556
[Katrinka laughs]

1066
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:47,436
[hounds barking]

1067
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:10,159
Bless that fox.

1068
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,528
Khalid's going
to overtake the hounds.

1069
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:15,398
At least we know where he is
for the next two hours.

1070
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:28,444
-Aziz? The plane?
-Yes, all set.

1071
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:31,347
Good work, love.
Hop right back in.

1072
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:36,385
Call me at the hotel tomorrow.

1073
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,320
There's no way I can thank you.

1074
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:41,223
[car starts]

1075
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:42,625
Bye.

1076
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,609
[Sabrina] Katrinka.

1077
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:04,146
What happened to you?

1078
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:07,283
The beast threw me.
What in the world is going on?

1079
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:09,718
Natalie wasn't feeling well
so she's going into London.

1080
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,521
She looked more distraught
than ill.

1081
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:15,524
And wasn't that your assistant,
Robin Dougherty?

1082
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:17,626
Come on, Katrinka, spill.

1083
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:21,697
Or let me find out on my own,
and believe me, I will.

1084
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:25,634
Sabrina, you and I
haven't been friends.

1085
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:27,636
But I respect you.

1086
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:30,639
I'm going to tell you the truth,
with the understanding

1087
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:33,375
that Natalie's future
and the happiness
of her little boy

1088
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:35,711
depend on you keeping
your mouth shut.

1089
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,614
-Am I clear?
-Perfectly.

1090
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:41,383
[Katrinka] Natalie's life with
Khalid has been a minor hell.

1091
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:45,287
If all goes well, she'll pick up
Aziz in Kensington Gardens

1092
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:48,524
within the hour and be on
a private flight to America

1093
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:50,960
before Khalid realizes
that she's gone.

1094
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:54,296
That is the story of the year.

1095
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:57,333
Which you are not
going to write.

1096
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,635
What you're going to do
is come with me into the house

1097
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:01,770
and we'll have a head start
on the hunt feast.

1098
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:06,709
Mrs. Graham,
you are some piece of work.

1099
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:12,281
[phone rings]

1100
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,551
Yeah.

1101
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:19,288
No, you gotta be kidding.

1102
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:20,656
No, she's right here.

1103
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,527
Khalid wants to speak to you.

1104
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,268
Yes, Khalid.

1105
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:35,571
I'm sorry, there's nothing
I can tell you.

1106
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:37,606
Certainly.

1107
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,709
If I hear anything from her,
I'll have her call you
right away.

1108
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:43,712
Goodbye.

1109
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:53,822
Where is she?

1110
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,561
Somewhere over North America.

1111
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:08,370
Khalid is the single most
important client

1112
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,539
of Graham Shipyards.

1113
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:13,475
If you've done anything
to jeopardize that relationship,

1114
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:15,411
I'll wring your neck.

1115
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:19,782
A fleet of tankers
is supposed to mean more to me

1116
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:22,451
than my best friend
and her little son?

1117
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:28,657
Natalie asked for my help
and I gave it to her.

1118
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:35,364
But don't worry,
she's on Jean-Claude's jet.

1119
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:38,667
Khalid will hardly
trace that back to you.

1120
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:41,537
[telephone ringing]

1121
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:46,375
Hello.

1122
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,644
[Paul]
Mrs. Graham.
Paul Zeiss.

1123
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:50,879
Robin, will you
excuse me for a moment?

1124
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,281
Oh, sure.

1125
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,655
-Mr. Zeiss.
-Some good news at last.

1126
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:02,491
One of my operatives
has found, in a warehouse,

1127
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:05,694
cartons of Zimmerman's files,
an inquiry from an attorney,

1128
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:10,733
Herbert Belin in Lucerne,
about adoption papers

1129
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,701
for a male infant, Kovar.

1130
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,703
Mr. Zeiss.

1131
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:17,539
It's too soon to celebrate
Mrs. Graham.

1132
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:19,408
-Belin retired to Zurich. 
-[knock on door]

1133
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,510
We're working full time
to locate him there.

1134
01:11:21,543 --> 01:11:24,346
But I did want you to have
the interim report.

1135
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:27,650
-Thank you.
-I'll keep you informed.

1136
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:29,518
Goodbye.

1137
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,353
What are you doing here?

1138
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:34,823
I got to fly to LA tonight,
looks like for about two weeks.

1139
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:38,560
-I'll go with you.
-I'm gonna have my hands
full out there.

1140
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:41,497
-I wouldn't be able
to spend any time with you.
-You won't have to.

1141
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:43,565
Natalie and I will go
to the spa.

1142
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:45,768
I don't want a continent
between us, Adam.

1143
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:50,139
You're right.

1144
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:51,640
Terrific.

1145
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:55,744
And after LA,
we'll go to Kitzbuhel. Yeah?

1146
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:57,746
Yes!

1147
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:06,955
[Adam] Listen, yes, I said
I'll be there and I'll be there.

1148
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:10,826
Yeah, all right. Meetings...

1149
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:13,762
-I've got meetings all week.
-[Katrinka sighs]

1150
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:17,399
[Adam] Why don't you go on
ahead to Kitzbuhel and...

1151
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:19,368
and I'll be there
in time for your birthday?

1152
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:23,405
Oh, Adam.

1153
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:27,409
I know, I'm disappointed, too,
but maybe once I get there,

1154
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:28,811
I can extend, huh?

1155
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,779
Maybe I'll fly to Paris.

1156
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:32,481
Do it.

1157
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:34,516
In the meantime...

1158
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:38,854
an advance birthday present.

1159
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:45,894
Thank you.

1160
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:47,529
You're welcome.

1161
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:52,835
The bad news
is that Mr. Belin,

1162
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,637
the attorney who contacted
Dr. Zimmerman

1163
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:57,773
about adoption papers
for your son,

1164
01:12:57,806 --> 01:12:59,808
died in Lucerne three years ago.

1165
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:02,911
The qualified good news is

1166
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:06,515
that his practice was
taken over by another lawyer

1167
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:10,552
who is willing to provide a list
of the clients he acquired
from Belin.

1168
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:13,789
This means a long
and costly paper trail,

1169
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:15,924
which could lead to nothing.

1170
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:19,862
But if your son's adoptive
parents are on the list,

1171
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:22,030
it could also result
in contact.

1172
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,032
Shall we go ahead?

1173
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,969
You know the answer
to that Mr. Zeiss.

1174
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:42,818
Jean-Claude!

1175
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:47,623
Do you realize that
following you down a ski slope

1176
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:49,992
is an intensely
erotic experience?

1177
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:52,961
You're outrageous.
How does Helen put up with you?

1178
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:55,764
Probably in much the same way
as you put up with Adam.

1179
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:58,801
[chuckles] I haven't seen you
since the great escape.

1180
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:01,837
Natalie was eternally
grateful to you.

1181
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:04,973
Mm. You and I were a pair
of fools, were we not?

1182
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:06,942
What do you mean?

1183
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,044
You really don't know?

1184
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,713
What?

1185
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:13,882
I didn't get Natalie
and your husband did.

1186
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,086
What do you mean?

1187
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:22,891
You're such an innocent,
and I wish you weren't.

1188
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:26,662
What or whom do you suppose
is keeping Adam in California

1189
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:28,063
while you're here?

1190
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:30,666
How do you know Adam's
in California?

1191
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:34,536
Natalie told me, of course.

1192
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:35,971
Natalie?

1193
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:38,841
Yes, my dear, Natalie.

1194
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:41,910
Shall we?

1195
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:07,636
[shower running]

1196
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,571
[Adam chuckles]

1197
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,582
[Natalie and Adam laughing]

1198
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:34,096
Don't let me interrupt.

1199
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:38,634
I just came to return
my birthday present.

1200
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:43,705
And to tell you
I want a divorce.

1201
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:53,949
[Adam hits wall]

1202
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:14,636
-[Adam] She's in a meeting?
Can't you do better than that?
-[door slams]

1203
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:17,773
You're not gonna negotiate
a divorce settlement
in the newspapers

1204
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:21,176
and you're not gonna
make a fool out of me
in the gossip columns.

1205
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:22,978
Publicity's publicity.

1206
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:25,180
At least she spelled
the name right.

1207
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:27,649
[Adam] Where the hell
did she get that picture?

1208
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:29,818
-Hmm?
-[glass shatters]

1209
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:33,155
That wasn't paparazzi,
that was taken
in our living room!

1210
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:36,758
Better in the living room
than in the shower.

1211
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:39,761
Call her off, Katrinka.

1212
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:44,700
I didn't call her on.

1213
01:16:44,733 --> 01:16:46,735
You spend your entire adult life
courting the press,

1214
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:49,037
so how can you be surprised
when they write about you?

1215
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,773
[telephone ringing]

1216
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:57,045
If that's your lawyer,

1217
01:16:57,079 --> 01:17:00,949
tell him he's got himself
a game of hardball.

1218
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:03,752
[ringing continues]

1219
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,155
Hello.

1220
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:08,924
Paul Zeiss, Mrs. Graham.

1221
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:11,693
I'm very sorry to give you
this kind of news, but...

1222
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:13,695
Dr. Zimmerman committed suicide

1223
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:16,064
this morning in Munich.

1224
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:19,101
Apparently,
he was in very bad health.

1225
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:23,171
We'll continue to make our way
through Attorney Belin's files,
of course,

1226
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:26,975
but at this point,
I am not overly optimistic.

1227
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:29,845
I'll keep you informed.

1228
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:31,113
Thank you.

1229
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:45,227
[door opens]

1230
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:52,234
Are you all right?

1231
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:01,143
I feel like I've lost
everything.

1232
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:06,248
Adam's being impossible.

1233
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:09,284
Every time I reach an agreement
about something,
he changes his mind.

1234
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:13,221
I think Adam's just realized
he's made a major mistake.

1235
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:14,956
He'll never marry Natalie.

1236
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,926
And I'll betcha he'd come back
if you'd let him.

1237
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:19,995
I won't. I can't.

1238
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,130
All the money,
all the women.

1239
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:25,767
All the children in this world
weren't enough to...

1240
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:27,202
satisfy Adam.

1241
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:30,038
And Adam's success
wasn't enough for me.

1242
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:35,010
I wanted to experience
everything, you know.

1243
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:39,347
But in the end,
what really matters
turns out to be so simple.

1244
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:42,818
Someone to love who loves you.

1245
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:45,253
And work to do
which gives you pleasure.

1246
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:47,055
Course, what else is there?

1247
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:52,561
Since someone to love doesn't
seem to be an option right now,

1248
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:54,896
I'm going to concentrate
about work.

1249
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,233
If I may say so,

1250
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:01,169
I think that you should just get
out of New York for a while.

1251
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:02,871
And do what?

1252
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:05,173
Well, I'm opening offices
in London.

1253
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:08,143
And I've bought myself
a little house in Mayfair.

1254
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:12,814
Katrinka, there's
this marvelous old hotel
for sale in Knightsbridge.

1255
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:15,817
Come to London, buy it...

1256
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:18,186
And we'll do the hotel together.

1257
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:19,855
[chuckles]

1258
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:26,361
[doorbell chimes]

1259
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,598
[Mark] Katrinka!

1260
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:31,600
-Mark!
-[Mark] Welcome to London.

1261
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:33,235
I heard about the hotel.

1262
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:36,972
I knew you were in town,
but Carlos wouldn't let me call

1263
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:39,374
because you were working
around the clock.

1264
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:41,309
You wretch!

1265
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:45,914
So, um...
make the most of your day.

1266
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,349
Thank you.

1267
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:51,119
I'm sorry about the divorce.

1268
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:53,188
It is a nightmare.

1269
01:19:53,221 --> 01:19:55,390
Adam's a master tactician and...

1270
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,260
delay seems to be
his tactic of choice.

1271
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,095
I can't say I blame him.

1272
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:05,867
Will you walk with me?

1273
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:07,269
Yeah, I'd like that.

1274
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:11,973
Does it ever go away?

1275
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:13,909
[Mark] Ah, I think about
the children

1276
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:15,177
every day of my life.

1277
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:18,413
But it's bearable now.

1278
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:21,449
You're the only person
who dares to broach the subject.

1279
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,352
[Katrinka] I should think it
would help to talk about them

1280
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:28,323
and to remember them
and to feel close to them.

1281
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:30,192
[Mark] Precisely.

1282
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:34,229
You're really very gifted.

1283
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:36,097
At what?

1284
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:38,200
Living.

1285
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:39,334
Thank you.

1286
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:43,305
I wanna make love
to you, Katrinka.

1287
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:48,443
Life is so short.

1288
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,178
So short.

1289
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:53,348
I hate to waste it
playing games.

1290
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:56,284
I can't go into that hotel
with you because in 20 minutes,

1291
01:20:56,318 --> 01:20:58,220
the whole world will know
about it

1292
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:00,121
and Adam will use it
to make more trouble.

1293
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:04,893
Come on with me.

1294
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:12,100
Say yes.

1295
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:14,269
Please!

1296
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:15,470
Say yes.

1297
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:19,941
How could I say anything else?

1298
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:21,343
Yes.

1299
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:31,152
Excuse me,
but Mr. Graham is here.

1300
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:33,455
She knows who I am.
Thanks.

1301
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:37,125
Adam.

1302
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:40,262
Yeah. I'm in London a lot
these days on business.

1303
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:43,265
I don't know, I just realized
that there's nothing
I'd like more

1304
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:45,533
than to spend a quiet
country weekend with you.

1305
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:49,537
To discuss our situation,
of course.

1306
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,409
What do you say?
Wanna drive up to Cambridge?

1307
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:57,545
-No.
-Oh. I'm sorry.

1308
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:02,751
Should be.

1309
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:04,452
[chuckles]

1310
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:09,090
No, I mean I'm sorry you won't
spend the weekend with me.

1311
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:12,761
According to our friend Sabrina,
you're involved with an actress.

1312
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:15,030
[Adam] Well, you know better
than to believe

1313
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:16,498
what you read
in the gossip columns.

1314
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:20,302
Although I must say, I'm kind of
enjoying being single again.

1315
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:24,372
You're not, and you
won't be until you sign
those divorce papers.

1316
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:28,376
I really have missed you.

1317
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:32,213
There's a lot going on
I'd like to talk to you about.

1318
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:35,150
I need an extension
on the deadline.

1319
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,554
I had to mortgage the apartment,
which means...

1320
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,023
the title isn't clear,
which means...

1321
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:44,426
I can't assign it to you.

1322
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,361
Then keep the apartment.

1323
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:52,033
Keep the apartment
and sign the papers.

1324
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:53,368
OK.

1325
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:55,537
The deadline stands.

1326
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:59,007
[doorbell buzzes]

1327
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:03,244
Is it official?

1328
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:07,582
As of 6 p.m. London time,
my divorce is final.

1329
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:10,618
-Congratulations.
-[Katrinka chuckles]

1330
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:13,188
Celebrate here or on the town?

1331
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:14,622
Oh, here, definitely here.

1332
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,325
[telephone rings]

1333
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:20,528
Let me deal with that and I'll
tell the board no more calls.

1334
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:22,630
Glasses are on the table.

1335
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:27,135
Hello.

1336
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:28,603
Mrs. Graham?

1337
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:30,338
Mr. Zeiss.

1338
01:23:30,372 --> 01:23:31,573
We found your son.

1339
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:45,220
I can only begin to imagine
how you must feel.

1340
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:47,255
I trust myself.

1341
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:50,258
More at this point
than ever before in my life.

1342
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:53,661
My son's in Kitzbuhel
at the Excelsior for the week.

1343
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,663
I'll leave tomorrow.

1344
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:58,666
Not necessarily
to introduce myself

1345
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:02,137
but to... see him.

1346
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:05,440
And if I can manage it,
to talk to him.

1347
01:24:05,473 --> 01:24:10,178
And then I'll trust myself
to decide what's right for him

1348
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:12,213
and for me.

1349
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:16,351
Want me to go with you?

1350
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:20,655
No.

1351
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:24,092
But thank you.

1352
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:30,632
[man] Ready when you are.

1353
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,236
Hey, Christian, let's go!

1354
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:42,510
Let's go!

1355
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:22,750
[laughs]

1356
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:25,753
-Who are you?
-Christian, isn't it?

1357
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:27,355
[Christian] Christian Heller.

1358
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:29,224
[Katrinka] Katrinka Graham.

1359
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:31,226
Used to come to the Golden Horn.

1360
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:33,761
We met a few years ago
at Prince Khalid's party
in London.

1361
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:37,665
I knew I recognized you,
but who knew you could
ski like that, huh?

1362
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:39,667
I'd forgotten I could myself.

1363
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:42,470
I was on the Czech ski team
before you were born.

1364
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:44,405
Would you like another run?

1365
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:46,608
I'm not sure I could
do it again.

1366
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:49,210
May I offer you tea
at the Golden Horn?

1367
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:50,445
You bet.

1368
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:57,318
-Do you still own this place?
-I do.

1369
01:25:57,352 --> 01:25:59,587
My friends, the Hubners,
retired,

1370
01:25:59,621 --> 01:26:02,790
but a young man from Gstaad
manages it for me now.

1371
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:04,425
I love it here.

1372
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:06,728
It was the best part
of my childhood.

1373
01:26:06,761 --> 01:26:08,429
-Really?
-Yeah.

1374
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:10,999
It's nice to hear that.

1375
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:13,535
My parents sent me away
to boarding school when I was 6.

1376
01:26:13,568 --> 01:26:16,538
But they'd collect me
at holidays and we'd come here

1377
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:19,807
and I could sort of pretend
we were a normal family.

1378
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:21,509
Weren't you?

1379
01:26:21,543 --> 01:26:23,811
A normal family?

1380
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,747
No, not really.

1381
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,782
My father was in
the diplomatic corps

1382
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:30,652
and changed posts
every couple of years.

1383
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:35,356
They decided boarding school
would give me some structure.

1384
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:37,492
I was a real handful.

1385
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:40,595
Perhaps I didn't like
being adopted.

1386
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:42,463
Did your parents tell you that?

1387
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:45,400
[Christian] It would have been
better if they had.

1388
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:48,603
A nurse got mad and laid it
on me when I was about 5.

1389
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:50,705
But if they adopted you,

1390
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:54,342
they must have
wanted a child very much.

1391
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,377
They must have loved you.

1392
01:26:56,411 --> 01:26:58,379
In their own way.

1393
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:01,249
I think they liked
the idea of a child.

1394
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:07,455
Did you ever wonder
about your birth parents?

1395
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:08,590
All the time.

1396
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:13,761
Did you ever try to find them?

1397
01:27:13,795 --> 01:27:18,333
No. I figured they probably
wouldn't be interested.

1398
01:27:33,548 --> 01:27:35,516
When's your birthday, Christian?

1399
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,385
October 7.

1400
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:43,524
I have a son who was born
October 7, 1970.

1401
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:46,761
He's my age exactly.
Where is he?

1402
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:50,665
[Katrinka] I've been trying
to find him for many years.

1403
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:54,602
I gave him up for adoption
when he was born.

1404
01:27:54,636 --> 01:27:57,105
You must have been very young.

1405
01:27:57,138 --> 01:27:59,607
And frightened.

1406
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:01,743
My lover was married.

1407
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:04,545
My parents had just died
suddenly.

1408
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:07,115
I... I didn't know what to do.

1409
01:28:07,148 --> 01:28:08,883
I made a terrible mistake.

1410
01:28:10,718 --> 01:28:12,820
One I've regretted ever since.

1411
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:16,491
Why are you telling me this?

1412
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:20,728
[Katrinka] So that perhaps
you'll understand...

1413
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:25,400
and forgive.

1414
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:26,834
Forgive who?

1415
01:28:33,508 --> 01:28:34,742
Me.

1416
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:38,413
You?

1417
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:43,651
You're my mother.

1418
01:28:43,685 --> 01:28:46,854
[Katrinka] I found out yesterday
who you are and where you were.

1419
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:48,856
I took a plane from London
this morning.

1420
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:52,593
I didn't come to tell you,
I just came to see you.

1421
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:54,896
If I've upset you, I'm sorry.

1422
01:28:56,798 --> 01:28:58,366
I'm not upset.

1423
01:29:01,969 --> 01:29:03,504
I'm just sort of stunned.

1424
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:09,744
So am I.

1425
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:18,853
I didn't think I'd like you.

1426
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:21,622
And?

1427
01:29:21,656 --> 01:29:24,425
God, I... don't know.

1428
01:29:38,473 --> 01:29:40,541
Here's my number in London.

1429
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:48,716
And this is my permanent number
in New York.

1430
01:29:57,859 --> 01:29:59,694
Please think about this.

1431
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:04,565
And call me if you want to.

1432
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:07,001
I hope so much you will.

1433
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:18,746
Auf Wiedersehen.

1434
01:30:21,282 --> 01:30:22,884
Auf Wiedersehen.

1435
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:37,498
[rings]

1436
01:30:39,834 --> 01:30:40,968
Hello.

1437
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:42,804
[Mark]
It's Mark.

1438
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:45,473
I'm so happy you called.

1439
01:30:48,709 --> 01:30:50,044
I wish you were here.

1440
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:51,979
Give me five seconds.
I'm in the lobby.

1441
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:53,514
What?

1442
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:25,980
You'll drive yourself crazy
waiting around for this call.

1443
01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:30,618
Why don't we go outside
for a while?

1444
01:31:30,651 --> 01:31:32,653
Yes.

1445
01:31:38,693 --> 01:31:41,863
If Christian calls,
the switchboard will
tell him where we are.

1446
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:43,831
Thank you.

1447
01:32:43,824 --> 01:32:45,393
Christian, Mark.

1448
01:32:45,426 --> 01:32:46,894
[Christian] Hi.
