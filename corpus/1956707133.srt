00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,908
- [Radio] What are you, bored?

3
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,327
Are we doing this? You
gotta be kiddin' me.

4
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,622
Wait for it. Ah,
oh my fuckin' God.

5
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:45,002
It's also, oh my fuckin' God,
what's wrong with you people?

6
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:49,256
It's time for OMFG,
Oh My Fuckin' God.

7
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,217
- [Radio] A 26-year-old
dairy man near Hanford,

8
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,428
about 30 miles South of Fresno

9
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,680
is replacing the fields
of corn and wheat he grows

10
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,892
to feed his cows with a
heartier wheat and rye hybrid

11
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:01,560
better suited for drought.

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,270
He's also working
with an engineer

13
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,397
to create a cow motion sensor.

14
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,233
The system, deployed
in his animal stalls,

15
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,485
would change...

16
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:17,201
(water rushing)

17
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:18,744
- [Mark] I never come here.

18
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,332
- [Jonah] You should,
it's so close.

19
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,293
- [Mark] I know.

20
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,881
It's beautiful here.

21
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,111
I kinda like you a lot.

22
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,658
- I kinda like you too.

23
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,452
- Good.

24
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:02,788
You better.

25
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:17,261
- Okay.

26
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:19,304
(laughing)

27
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:57,009
Hey.

28
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,345
Kiss me

29
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,600
like you just got
back from the war.

30
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,686
- What?

31
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:12,065
(alarm beeps)

32
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,403
- [Jonah] Babe.

33
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:22,201
Come on, can you...

34
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,001
Jesus, we talked about
the fucking snooze button.

35
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,169
- I'm sorry.

36
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:38,884
Hey.

37
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:41,720
Happy birthday.

38
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:42,721
- [Mark] No.

39
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,181
- Mmhm.

40
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,893
- [Mark] I wasn't born until
like, 6 o'clock at night.

41
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,568
- Hey.

42
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:58,820
Hey.

43
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,113
- What?

44
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,740
- I'll be right back, I
gotta run some errands.

45
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,699
- Take your time.

46
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,702
- [Jonah] I love you too.

47
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:09,873

48
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:53,208
(he speaks in German)

49
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,802
- Let's try that last one again.

50
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,970
Not quite so evil.

51
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,557
- They're Nazi's right?

52
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,435
- Yeah. Just, you know.

53
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:12,519
- Okay.

54
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,354
- [Man] It's a
computer game for kids,

55
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,315
client wants to keep
it pretty mellow.

56
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,983
- Mellow Nazi, got it.

57
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,279
(he speaks in German)

58
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,323
- [Man] Great, see what I mean?

59
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,574
- Totally.

60
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:26,950
- Okay, so now just do
some of the death sounds

61
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,243
on the next page.

62
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,661
(he grunts)

63
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,121
Wait for my signal.

64
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,960
(he grunts)

65
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,141
Just skip to the bottom for the

66
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,768
being electrocuted part.

67
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,687
- Um, I'm not sure
how to do the um,

68
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,898
falling down a
cliff while on fire.

69
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,693
- I don't know, I
didn't write it.

70
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,029
You're the actor,
just make a choice.

71
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,238
- Beautiful.

72
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,370
(he moans)

73
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,998
- Great, thank you.

74
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:21,254
- [Radio] Possibility that
all dinosaurs had feathers,

75
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,091
not just the later
ones that became birds.

76
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:26,385
Today's guest has an
article in science

77
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:28,720
about that new find
and the many questions

78
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,055
that come along with...

79
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:56,456
- [Radio] We know that
birds are dinosaurs,

80
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,084
but when did dinosaurs
start becoming birds?

81
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,293
- You guys gonna
stick with cocktails

82
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,378
or get wine or?

83
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,296
- Wine makes you
tired, remember?

84
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,923
- [Nicole] Wait, whatever
happened to that movie?

85
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,049
Did you hear?

86
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,593
- Nope, still have a pin in me.

87
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,053
- [Nicole] That's awesome.

88
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,722
- [Jonah] He's totally
gonna get this one.

89
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,933
- You keep saying that babe.

90
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,519
- So, what's new with you two?

91
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,772
- Umm, we are taking
a little hiatus.

92
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,065
- [Craig] Jesus Christ.

93
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,776
- [Nicole] What? I just,
I want to enjoy dinner.

94
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,111
- You're doing what?

95
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,864
- We're taking a little hiatus.

96
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,282
- Like a break?

97
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,450
- Sort of.

98
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,827
I mean, we were both
just a little crazy

99
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,996
with the wedding
coming up so soon, so.

100
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,123
- [Craig] We just thought
it'd be a good idea to

101
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,083
play the field one
last time, ya know?

102
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:40,959
- How little?

103
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,210
- Like three months.

104
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,838
Don't ask, don't tell, you know?

105
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,631
- That makes no fucking sense.

106
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,053
- Awkward.

107
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:56,141
- Sure, why the hell not.
Knock yourselves out.

108
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,642
- Seriously?

109
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,311
- What do we know?

110
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,692
Stop.

111
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,944
- Come here.

112
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,321
(he sighs)

113
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,657
- What's your name?

114
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,493
- Tequila is not your friend.

115
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,912
- That's a weird fucking name.

116
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,080
- You want some water?

117
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,499
- No, come here.

118
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,460
I was watching you
from over there.

119
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,586
It's your first night here, huh?

120
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:25,837
- Babe, come on.

121
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,506
- You come on. You're
such a fucking buzzkill.

122
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,299
- Just you and me, okay?

123
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,842
- Imagine you're a straight guy.

124
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,969
- Imagine there's
this guy, Mark,

125
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,721
and it's his birthday.

126
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,097
And he and his boyfriend, Jonah,

127
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,391
are gonna have some
really great birthday sex.

128
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,728
- My birthday's over.

129
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,828
- [Jonah] Hey,
let's make a baby.

130
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,584
- Stop.

131
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,127
- [Jonah] Don't be an asshole.

132
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,297
- Jonah, come here.

133
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,507
- What?

134
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,053
- You're a straight
guy at a video store

135
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,263
and you're browsing.

136
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,472
- [Jonah] I'm not
doing that right now.

137
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,390
- Come on.

138
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,849
- No.

139
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,227
I don't go to video
stores anyway.

140
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,354
- I'm sure there's
one somewhere.

141
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,690
What's your name?

142
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:28,233
- Babe, seriously.

143
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,573
- Okay, fuck.

144
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,825
Let's just jerk off.

145
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,936
(moaning)

146
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,354
Oh baby.

147
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,567
(moaning)

148
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,362
Oh fuck. Oh, oh, fuck.

149
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,289
(vomiting)

150
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,259
- So this guy, trying
to be a good pet owner,

151
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,470
he takes his dog to the
vet to get his shots,

152
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,972
to get his shots or whatever,

153
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,308
then examines the dog.

154
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,893
It isn't a dog at all.

155
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:49,105
It's a ferret that was fed
steroids to look like a poodle.

156
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,690
Get outta here.

157
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,233
Get outta here!

158
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,485
- [Radio] I mean, does this
thing even look like a poodle?

159
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,778
No, absolutely not.

160
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,072
- Does it, I mean, does
it look like a poodle?

161
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,615
- [Radio] I got some
photos up on the website.

162
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,367
This guy with his 800 dollars.

163
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,535
- No way, it looks like
a rat with a wig on.

164
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,454
- [Radio] That is a great
business idea, right?

165
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,413
Oh yeah, it's genius.

166
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,165
- Get outta here.

167
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,466
(watch beeps)

168
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,779
- [Phone] Global Talent.

169
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,281
- Hi, may I speak
with Rick please?

170
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,075
- [Phone] He's not
in, who's calling?

171
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,662
- Mark Miller. Could you
have him call me back?

172
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,373
- [Phone] He prefers email.

173
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,958
- Okay, well I did
email him twice,

174
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,419
which is why I'm calling.

175
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,878
- [Phone] Well, just
email him again.

176
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,380
He's had a crazy week.

177
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,049
- Okay, I'll do that, thank you.

178
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,510
- [Phone] Okay. Bye bye.

179
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,554
- Jesus Christ.

180
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:06,725
(classical music)

181
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,663
Do you want some salad?

182
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,263
Jonah.

183
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,390
- Yeah?

184
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,517
- [Mark] Do you want some salad?

185
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,643
- What are you putting in it?

186
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,854
- Fucking salad.

187
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:35,980
- [Jonah] Yeah.

188
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,816
- I got avocados.

189
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,068
- [Jonah] Okay,
yeah I'll have some.

190
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,152
Thank you.

191
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,487
- You're welcome.

192
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,258
- My step-mom
called again today.

193
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,092
- Oh yeah?

194
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,510
- Yeah.

195
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,137
Not gonna leave me alone
with the Christmas stuff.

196
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,973
Are you sure you don't wanna
go there for Christmas?

197
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,015
- Absolutely not.

198
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:13,852
- Got it.

199
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,019
- They're insane.

200
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,396
- They're my family.

201
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:19,524
- Okay.

202
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,360
- That's a lot of pills.

203
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,572
- It's just supplements.

204
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,657
They're all natural.

205
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,617
- [Mark] And are they working?
Are you feeling any better?

206
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:30,577
- Yeah.

207
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,456
- [Jonah] Okay.

208
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,542
- I'm just stressed.

209
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,918
- [Jonah] About what?

210
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,882
- I don't know. You
know, everything?

211
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,146
- What'd you mean
the other night

212
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:01,900
at the restaurant when you
said, "What do we know?"

213
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,067
- Huh?

214
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,360
- The other night
at the restaurant,

215
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,820
you said, "What do we
know about anything?"

216
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:07,989
- Oh.

217
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,449
- [Jonah] Yeah.

218
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:15,830
- I don't know. What do we
know about their relationship?

219
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,040
Relationships are messy.

220
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,085
- So, we're fine, right?

221
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:23,671
- Yeah.

222
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:30,887
- Are you okay?

223
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,349
- Yeah, why?

224
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,771
- I dunno.

225
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,273
I just miss talking to you.

226
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,275
- We're talking
right now, aren't we?

227
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,571
- Yeah. Yeah, we are.

228
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,284
You know what, you
don't have to stop

229
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,953
what you're doing right
now, I'm sure you've got

230
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,287
lots of stuff to
do and everything.

231
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,957
- No, no, I'm good.

232
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,625
- Okay.

233
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,004
- Hi.

234
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,130
- Hi.

235
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,924
- How are you?

236
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,509
- I'm good. How are you?

237
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:12,929
- I'm good.

238
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,478
- So, what do you
wanna do for Christmas?

239
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,479
- I dunno.

240
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,108
- Could go to Mexico again.

241
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,737
- Yeah, that sounds nice.

242
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:30,613
- Yeah?

243
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,329
(crickets chirp)

244
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,580
- [Jonah] Goodnight.

245
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,083
- [Mark] Goodnight.

246
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,689
Can you lay on top
of me for a bit?

247
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:07,734
- Yeah.

248
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,287
- Just make yourself
really heavy here.

249
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,371
- [Jonah] Okay.

250
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:24,667
How's that?

251
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,430
- Do you think I'm masculine?

252
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:43,061
- Yeah, of course. Why?

253
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:47,774
- I dunno.

254
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,404
It's just to know what
I'm missing, you know.

255
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:01,287
- With video chat apps
and the Neptune Two's

256
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,040
front-facing camera,
(phone buzzes)

257
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:07,835
with video chats,
chaps, video apps.

258
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,089
With video chat and the
Neptune Two's, Jesus Christ...

259
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,967
Video chat apps and
the Neptune Two's

260
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:18,513
front-facing camera, you
can chat face to face

261
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,264
with friends and family.

262
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,187
Chat face to face to
family and friends,

263
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:29,023
with the Neptune Two's
front-facing camera.

264
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,733
Neptune Two's front
facing camera.

265
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:31,984
(phone buzzes)

266
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:48,019
(turn signal clicks)

267
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,754
- [Mark] I never come here.

268
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,715
- You should.

269
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,925
It's so close.

270
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:21,719
- I know.

271
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:25,681
It's really beautiful here.

272
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,272
I kind of like you a lot.

273
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,195
- [Jonah] I kind
of like you too.

274
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:42,448
(phone buzzes)

275
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,824
- Shit.

276
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,586
(door buzzes)

277
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,004
- [Woman] TTM?

278
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,965
- [Mark] Yeah, hi, Mark
Miller, I have an audition.

279
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,383
- [Woman] They're at lunch.

280
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,344
- [Mark] When are
they coming back?

281
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,388
- [Woman] Actually,
they're done for the day.

282
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,432
They auditions
ended an hour ago.

283
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,684
- [Mark] Gotcha.

284
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,037
(phone buzzes)

285
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,722
(he sighs)

286
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:02,778
(smashing)
- [Mark] Fuck!

287
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,323
Jesus fucking Christ!

288
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,325
I'm such a fucking asshole.

289
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,493
Fuck.

290
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,289
- Are you okay?

291
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,915
- What?

292
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,167
Yeah, I got it.

293
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,003
- All right.

294
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,323
Do you have a minute?

295
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,533
- Yeah?

296
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:51,911
- Hi.

297
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:53,871
- I'm sorry, who are you?

298
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,040
- Emily, second floor, creative.

299
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,541
- Still nothing.

300
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,171
- Elevator, you spilled coffee
on my dress, beige dress,

301
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,255
said if I ever needed--

302
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:04,840
- Yes, the elevator,
beige dress,

303
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,510
low up top, high down
below, Melanie, hi.

304
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:08,886
- Emily.

305
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,514
- Yeah, I know.

306
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,933
- Well, I have submitted
requests for a raise,

307
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,434
but it's been--

308
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,186
- You know, here's the thing
about people saying anything,

309
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,771
didn't really mean anything.

310
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,022
- Really?

311
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,273
- True story, so, if
there's anything else

312
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,525
that you need?

313
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:23,901
- No, just that raise.

314
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,111
- A kiss?

315
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,028
- A what?

316
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,154
- You know, those things,

317
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,614
they make everything
suddenly better.

318
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,408
- You don't have an
assistant for that?

319
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,827
- He's not my type. (laughs)

320
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,703
- Would it help with my raise?

321
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,747
- Let's just say
it couldn't hurt.

322
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,250
- Okay, I'll take
a kiss, I guess.

323
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:43,254
I'm good from here, thank you.

324
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:45,297
- What, you don't
want to kiss me?

325
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,549
- What? No.

326
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:47,758
I'm not going to kiss
anybody in the audition,

327
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,260
I'm just gonna, you
know, just fake it.

328
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,429
- Come on, we never
make out any more.

329
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,306
- Okay, so we're in a no
kissing phase then I guess.

330
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,393
- Oh really? How long is
that phase going to last?

331
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,602
- [Mark] I dunno.

332
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,398
- Do you like me?

333
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,151
- Huh?

334
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,528
- Not a trick question,
do you like me?

335
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,113
- Yes.

336
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,239
Why would you ask that?

337
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,782
- Because I can't tell.

338
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,792
Wow, that was amazing.

339
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,170
- Sorry. Come here.

340
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,400
- Mark?

341
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:47,276
- Hmm?

342
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,864
- You know,

343
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,158
like a year ago when you stopped

344
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,785
taking your medication?

345
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,996
You told me if you
ever acted weird or...

346
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,333
That I should let you know?

347
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,127
- Mmhm.

348
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,424
- I'm letting you know.

349
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,805
I just think you
should think about it.

350
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:30,986
- [Nicole] God, I fucking
love being single.

351
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,030
- We're calling it that now?

352
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,908
- Calling it bookends I guess.

353
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,993
- Looks good.

354
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,787
- What? Don't be judgey.

355
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,247
This is the only way
I'm gonna be sure

356
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:44,208
that I'm not gonna make a
huge mistake when I say I do.,

357
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,086
God, what is it about those
words that make me wanna puke.

358
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,090
Seriously, I lost seven pounds.

359
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:52,550
There's like, nothing
like a relationship

360
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:54,843
to make you fuck up your body.

361
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:56,679
- You're ridiculous.

362
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:58,347
- I'm seeing the comic tonight.

363
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,391
- Single Sam?

364
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:01,392
- I know.

365
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:02,810
I might love him.

366
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,603
Our chemistry's insane.

367
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,232
- Go ahead then.

368
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:09,483
- Well, I will.

369
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,027
I dunno, I just think
he's like the one guy

370
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:15,281
I've always just kind
of wondered, what if.

371
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,369
- How's Greg doing?

372
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:23,163
- I don't know, we don't
really talk about it,

373
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,082
he hasn't asked.

374
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,208
Why, did you see him?

375
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,084
- No.

376
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,504
Is he dating anybody?

377
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,716
- [Nicole] I want him
to. He's too nice.

378
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,718
- Oh, that word.

379
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,844
- What?

380
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,762
- Nice.

381
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,764
- Jonah thinks if we can
just go back to the beginning

382
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,600
everything will be all right.

383
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:46,061
- [Nicole] Because you're
the jerk and he's the victim.

384
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,606
People always put you in that
role, it's very convenient.

385
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,109
For what it's worth, you
know, my friend Emily

386
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,736
has this therapist
that she loves.

387
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:56,405
Totally turned shit
around for her.

388
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:59,033
You want me to get her number?

389
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:00,117
- I dunno.

390
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:02,870
Maybe.

391
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:12,690
(Eva talks in Spanish)

392
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:15,025
- [Eva] There's no more bleach.

393
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,485
- [Mark] What?

394
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:19,863
- Bleach. Can you buy
more bleach for next time?

395
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:24,702
- Mmhm. Maybe we can use
a little bit less though?

396
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,413
I don't like inhaling
all that stuff.

397
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:28,414
- Sorry?

398
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,751
- Oh, no, never mind.

399
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:36,380
Hey, Eva?

400
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,091
- [Eva] Yes?

401
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:40,259
- How are you?

402
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,721
- Fine, you?

403
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:45,556
- I'm good.

404
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,224
- How's Jonah?

405
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:51,019
- He's good, he's rehearsing
for this singing thing.

406
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,188
- He's so nice, Jonah.

407
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,275
- Yeah, yeah.

408
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:58,068
- [Eva] You're very nice too.

409
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:32,830
- Hi.

410
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:36,416
- [Mark] What?

411
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,960
- I said hi.

412
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:39,044
- Hi.

413
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:41,421
You want some of this?

414
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,881
- No, I'm good, thanks.

415
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:45,801
- How was rehearsal?

416
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,594
- It was good.

417
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:48,846
- Good.

418
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,682
I made an appointment
with a therapist for us.

419
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,394
- Why?

420
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,940
Are we breaking up?

421
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:04,862
- It's definitely one of
the possibilities, right?

422
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:07,239
- Oh, okay. Fuck.

423
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:11,201
- We can't just go back
to the beginning, Jonah.

424
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,371
Yeah, no, you're right.

425
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,458
Okay, thanks for doing that.

426
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,377
- [Mark] Yeah, it's
Thursday at 11.

427
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,805
- What seems to be
the biggest issue?

428
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,934
- Well, we haven't been
very affectionate lately.

429
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:41,315
We don't talk about
things much any more

430
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:43,692
and, yeah, we kind
of do our own thing

431
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:44,776
which isn't what I want.

432
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,738
- What do you want Jonah?

433
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:54,036
- I want us to act like
a couple like we used to.

434
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:57,623
Have fun again, I mean,
otherwise, what's the point?

435
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,418
- But I mean, we can't just go
back to the beginning, right?

436
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,920
That's unrealistic.

437
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,589
- Mark, do you feel like
you're looking for reasons

438
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,257
to get out of the relationship?

439
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,551
Or reasons to get into it?

440
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:12,763
- Well, I dunno.

441
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:16,308
- Think about it for a moment.

442
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,104
- Well, I'm here, so...

443
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,566
I wanna get in it.

444
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,778
I think.

445
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,031
- Good. Otherwise it's just
a waste of our time, really.

446
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,824
- Yeah, like I said, I'm here.

447
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,622
- How'd you guys meet?

448
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:42,960
- We met at a bar.

449
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:45,462
- We were both
looking for a rebound.

450
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,130
- I mean, there's
more to it than that.

451
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,800
- Yes, I know that, it's just,

452
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:51,677
we had both just
broken up with someone.

453
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,012
- And?

454
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,306
- Nothing.

455
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:01,311
- How's your sex life?

456
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,609
- It's not really happening.

457
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:11,405
- Do you masturbate?

458
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:14,908
- We can't masturbate?

459
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,453
- Well, you jerk off a lot.

460
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:24,084
You do, you watch a lot of porn.

461
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,419
- Okay.

462
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:28,171
- I'm not saying I
don't, I'm just, I dunno.

463
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,508
I'm saying, when I do,
I think about us, you.

464
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,927
- You do?

465
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:38,390
- Wow.

466
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:42,769
- Do me a favor, get up.

467
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,522
- Right now?

468
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:50,360
- Yes, stand up and
embrace one another.

469
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,702
Just breathe together
for a moment.

470
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,343
- [Mark] I never come here.

471
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,388
- You should, it's so close.

472
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,309
- I know.

473
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,271
- I'm cold.

474
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:50,295
- [Therapist] How'd that feel?

475
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,259
- I um, it was...

476
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:00,388
I dunno.

477
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,617
- It's green.

478
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:28,959
You all right?

479
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,086
- Yeah, why?

480
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:55,652
(Jonah hums)

481
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,122
How do you do it?

482
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:08,248
- What?

483
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,210
- You're just always
in a good mood.

484
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,838
- Hah, I don't know.

485
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,175
It depends on what
you focus on, I guess.

486
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:22,846
- Right.

487
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,785
I just think we're different.

488
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:11,353
- [Phone] You have reached the
office of Dr. Grey Wintrow.

489
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:13,313
You may interrupt this
message at any time

490
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,148
by pressing the pound key.

491
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,858
If you are reaching
us during lunch,

492
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,568
please call back
after 1 o'clock.

493
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,278
Thank you.

494
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,446
(phone beeps)

495
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,241
- [Mark] Hi, this
is Mark Miller,

496
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:26,576
I was a patient of
yours a few years ago.

497
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,911
I wanted to see
if I could come in

498
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:31,122
for a medication appointment
as soon as possible.

499
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,750
My number is 310-852-7--

500
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,766
(water rushing)

501
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:15,333
(slow, ominous music)

502
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:25,677
(beeping)

503
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,266
- Mark!

504
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:34,728
Hey, what's up?

505
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,189
You live around here?

506
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,150
- [Mark] Yeah, up on Beachwood.

507
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:41,943
- Very cool.

508
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,612
Mm, we're practically neighbors.

509
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,364
I live by Larchmont.

510
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,825
- [Mark] No way? How you been?

511
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,452
- I've been good.

512
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:51,995
I'm on my way to a
fitting for this film,

513
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,413
it's a really cool part.

514
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:56,708
I'm playing a solder with
post traumatic stress...

515
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:58,668
Whatever.

516
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,337
- Stress disorder, yeah.

517
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:01,504
- Yeah.

518
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,006
I had to go in for
it like, four times,

519
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:06,426
it's been an emotional
roller coaster, you know?

520
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:10,138
Soon as you feel like you're
losing your mind, right?

521
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,222
- Yeah.

522
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,515
I went in for that, actually.

523
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,185
Be crazy if we got to
work together, huh?

524
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:18,438
- Yeah, well, they're
shooting the there tomorrow,

525
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,107
so pretty sure it's all cast.

526
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,108
- Gotcha.

527
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,277
- We should hang
sometime though.

528
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,278
- Yeah, it sounds good.

529
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,364
- Neighbor.

530
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,240
You have the same number?

531
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:30,825
- Yep.

532
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,452
- And you're still
with the same guy?

533
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:34,204
- No.

534
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,163
- All right.

535
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:36,373
- All right.

536
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:38,666
Good to see you.

537
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:42,879
- You too, I'll, I'll text you.

538
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,172
- Sounds good.

539
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,570
(phone buzzes)

540
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:07,881
(he breathes heavily)

541
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:14,948
- Think about when you
were newly in love.

542
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:18,535
What were the kinds of things
you would do for each other,

543
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:20,078
you know, for no special reason,

544
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,373
just to make the other
person feel good.

545
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:24,832
On your sheet of paper,

546
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:27,418
I want you to complete
this sentence.

547
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,881
I used to feel loved
and cared about when you

548
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:35,343
held my hand as we
walked, for example,

549
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:39,556
or called me up just to tell
me how much you love me.

550
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:40,974
- You're kidding right?

551
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:45,103
- [Therapist] It's gonna
feel artificial at first.

552
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:47,272
- Yeah, you think?

553
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:49,774
- All right, you're an actor?

554
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,944
Think of it like make-believe.

555
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:55,446
Putting the cart in
front of the horse,

556
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:58,032
eventually you will
feel an inner shift.

557
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,242
- I dunno.

558
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:02,787
- You don't?

559
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,247
- What?

560
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,462
- [Therapist] Humor me.
What do you have to lose?

561
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:40,218
- Do you need this here?

562
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,386
- No, go ahead.

563
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,455
That's subtle.

564
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:12,834
- Really?

565
00:45:12,836 --> 00:45:13,876
- What?

566
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:17,046
- Nothing.

567
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,881
- I'm just saying that
was really obvious,

568
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,091
I didn't say...

569
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:23,678
- At least I'm making
an effort, are you?

570
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:26,597
- Okay.

571
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,228
- It's all you got?

572
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:42,572
- You don't think these
exercises are ridiculous?

573
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,076
I didn't say I didn't like it.

574
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:56,127
Yeah, I'm an asshole,
what else is new.

575
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,221
Dammit.

576
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:31,389
- [Mark] Hey.

577
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:32,223
- Hi.

578
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:35,810
- [Mark] How are you?

579
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:38,062
- I'm good, how are you?

580
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,438
- [Mark] Good.

581
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,649
Do you got a minute?

582
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:43,192
- Yeah, sure.

583
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,279
What's up?

584
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:51,868
- I wanted to apologize.

585
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:55,621
- For what?

586
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,874
- Everything?

587
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:01,002
Seriously, it must be
fucking crazy being with me.

588
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:04,881
I'm really sorry for all the
stuff I'm putting you through.

589
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:08,593
- Are you okay?

590
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,888
- Yeah, why?

591
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,183
- [Jonah] I dunno.

592
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:17,560
- Started taking
this new medication.

593
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:22,148
- You did? Why
didn't you tell me?

594
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,734
- Because I'm me, I
suck, I dunno. Sorry.

595
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:30,489
But I was thinking, let's
have a date night tonight.

596
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,576
Why not?

597
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:35,620
I was gonna go get
some champagne.

598
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:40,166
- Okay.

599
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:41,250
- [Mark] Yeah?

600
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,501
- Yeah.

601
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,337
- Awesome.

602
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,339
I'll see you later?

603
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:49,258
- Yeah, I'll be here.

604
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:13,449
(buzzing)

605
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:15,952
- Fuck.

606
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:19,580
Um, it's okay.

607
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:27,630
(electronic music)

608
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:37,264
Come on, dance with me.

609
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,143
- This is weird.

610
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:59,412
- It's only gonna get worse.

611
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:02,832
The longer you wait, the more
embarrassing it's gonna be.

612
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:05,209
Come on!

613
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:11,340
Oh yeah.

614
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:30,026
Hey.

615
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:31,986
- Hello.

616
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:56,218
- You smell nice.

617
00:50:58,556 --> 00:50:59,764
- [Jonah] So do you.

618
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,273
- I'm gonna change
the music, okay?

619
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:10,357
- Okay.

620
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:19,700
- You come here often?

621
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:20,868
- Really?

622
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,036
- I don't really
like leather bars

623
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:25,873
but I hear they got
good beers on tap.

624
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:31,128
- Yeah, yeah, they
got good tap beers.

625
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:34,340
I'm Jonah.

626
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:35,424
- Mark.

627
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:39,178
You're hot.

628
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,679
- I'm pretty average.

629
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,306
- If you say so.

630
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:46,685
- I'm like a six, but I own
it, so that makes me a seven.

631
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,521
You're like an eight
who thinks he's a ten,

632
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:50,606
so that knocks you
down to a seven.

633
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:53,442
- Fucking perfect, then.

634
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,778
You wanna get some shots?

635
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,695
- Yeah.

636
00:51:57,949 --> 00:51:58,697
- I'll be right back.

637
00:51:58,699 --> 00:51:59,532
- Okay.

638
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,284
- Don't move.

639
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,454
Seriously, do not move.

640
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:37,987
They ran out of limes.

641
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,573
- What do you expect
from a leather bar?

642
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,657
- Seriously.

643
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:44,785
To us.

644
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:15,149
Just play the song, please.

645
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:24,158
- Okay, okay.

646
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:36,128
? Driving down lonely road.

647
00:53:39,175 --> 00:53:42,051
? A thousand people beside me.

648
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:49,058
? Walking down crowded street.

649
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:55,022
? And all I hear is your feet.

650
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:02,029
? Traffic stop, I'm on my own.

651
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:07,284
? Today you you called my phone

652
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:11,455
? alone, alone, alone, alone.

653
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:14,667
? A thousand miles
and maybe three.

654
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:21,090
? And I just need
you close to me.

655
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:27,471
? And is this it,
and is this all?

656
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:34,395
? Young love will always fall.

657
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:40,943
? But you can't help but fall

658
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:44,238
? we fell the right,

659
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,616
? your eyes, the night,

660
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:51,036
? I lay on you,

661
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:54,206
? The hill, the moon,

662
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:57,626
? the smoke, the room,

663
00:54:57,628 --> 00:55:02,589
? the way your made me feel. ?

664
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,928
- That was amazing.

665
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:11,807
You're so beautiful.

666
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,937
- I feel weird.

667
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:17,896
- Hmm?

668
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:18,981
- I dunno.

669
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:20,983
- Good weird or bad weird?

670
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:22,151
- I dunno.

671
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:25,237
- Don't be mad.

672
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,239
- What?

673
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:30,659
- Remember how you said

674
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:31,660
you want to do ecstasy
again sometime?

675
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,497
- What are you talking about?

676
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:39,168
- Well, remember that barbecue
we were at at Silver Lake,

677
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:42,671
and we did E, and
it was amazing.

678
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:50,262
- Shut the fuck up,
are you kidding me?

679
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,014
What the fuck?

680
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:55,059
- I just wanted
tonight to be good.

681
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:56,602
- [Jonah] I have
rehearsal in the morning,

682
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:58,437
are you fucking crazy?

683
00:55:58,439 --> 00:55:59,396
Fuck.

684
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,191
- I'm sorry.

685
00:56:08,324 --> 00:56:11,950
- [Jonah] Am I good
looking enough for you?

686
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:15,287
- [Mark] What are you talking
about? You're beautiful.

687
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,791
- [Jonah] I dunno.

688
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:22,753
Sounds like all your exes
are very different types.

689
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,340
- [Mark] You're perfect.

690
00:56:26,342 --> 00:56:27,841
Fuck them.

691
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,053
- [Jonah] Okay.

692
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:47,820
- Can I ask you something?

693
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:50,697
- Yeah.

694
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:55,577
- You don't really like
sucking my dick, huh?

695
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:01,750
- I don't know.

696
00:57:03,421 --> 00:57:06,296
Yeah, I guess it's just
not really my thing.

697
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,425
- It's because I'm uncut?

698
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:12,636
- What? No.

699
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,721
- I know it's kind of weird.

700
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:18,934
- No it's not, it's natural.

701
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,561
It's the way it's
meant to be, right?

702
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:25,441
I like your turtleneck.

703
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:26,692
- Oh my god.

704
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:38,912
- [Jonah] I can't
believe you drugged me.

705
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,040
- I know, I'm sorry.

706
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:47,463
- [Jonah] You know
that's like, crazy right?

707
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:52,217
- I just wanted tonight
to be, you know.

708
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:53,886
- [Jonah] Yeah, I know.

709
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:02,186
I am so high.

710
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,691
Hey.

711
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:08,817
- [Mark] Hmm?

712
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,155
- [Jonah] Let's get naked.

713
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:15,365
- [Mark] Okay. Yeah.

714
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,914
- [Jonah] I wanna
be naked with you.

715
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:33,926
- [Mark] Do you remember
when we started dating,

716
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:36,553
and I twisted my ankle?

717
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:39,139
I couldn't even walk.

718
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,183
You drove all the
way to my house,

719
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:44,102
took me to the doctor,
drove me back home,

720
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:47,064
and got me Thai food.

721
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:49,650
It was so sweet.

722
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:51,360
And that's when I knew.

723
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:59,826
- [Jonah] You know what I
remember about that day?

724
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,328
On the way back
from the hospital,

725
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,955
you put your seat
all the way back

726
00:59:02,957 --> 00:59:05,958
and closed your eyes for a bit.

727
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,543
It was so beautiful.

728
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:10,629
Like you really trusted me.

729
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:17,678
- [Mark] Hey, whatever
happens happens, okay?

730
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:27,563
(classical music)

731
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:48,060
(distorted humming)

732
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,376
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

733
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:05,721
- [Phone] You have reached
the office of Dr. Grey Wintrow.

734
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:07,723
You may interrupt this
message at any time

735
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:09,307
by pressing the pound key.

736
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:11,351
- Doctor Wintrow
this is Mark Miller,

737
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:13,270
it's on the fourth day of the...

738
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:16,982
I'm not doing so good,

739
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:18,984
so if you could call
me back whenever--

740
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:19,860
- Mark.

741
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:20,861
Mark!

742
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:22,195
- What? No.

743
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:25,741
These new meds, my
fucking head, it's just...

744
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:29,411
- Okay, okay, what can I do?

745
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:30,579
Mark!

746
01:02:30,581 --> 01:02:32,748
Hey, you wanna go
lie down on the bed?

747
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:33,915
- There's this sound in my head,

748
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,500
it's just fucking crazy.

749
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:37,544
- How about some tea?
You want some tea?

750
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:39,087
- I don't want any
fucking tea, Jonah.

751
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,423
- All right, all
right, fuck the tea.

752
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,592
Here give me your
hand, come here.

753
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:45,218
Look at me, look at me.

754
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:48,847
Hey, you're going to
be okay, all right?

755
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:52,017
Everything's going to be fine.

756
01:02:53,645 --> 01:02:56,313
I'm gonna be right back,
I think we have some Xanax

757
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:57,481
leftover somewhere.

758
01:02:57,483 --> 01:02:59,608
- I just wanna be alone.

759
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,109
- [Jonah] I'm not gonna
leave you like this,

760
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,445
you're gonna take the
Xanax, or I'm calling 911.

761
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:12,954
How's that?

762
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:15,332
- Thank you .

763
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:33,975
- [Therapist] How was your week?

764
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:38,522
- It was a fucking mess.

765
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,942
I tried out a different
antidepressant,

766
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:44,277
and I had a full-blown
panic attack.

767
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:45,987
It took me two days
to get back to normal

768
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,489
whatever the fuck that is.

769
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:51,409
- Maybe...

770
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,287
What if you went
back on that stuff

771
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,289
that you were on
when I first met you?

772
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,043
You remember that?

773
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:03,004
- Yeah, that's
definitely an option.

774
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,257
- You seemed happy then.

775
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:08,677
- Basically, I have a
lot of fucking shame

776
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:10,595
taking this stuff.

777
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:12,556
I feel like I need to be
able to do it on my own.

778
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:18,854
- Did you try doing
any of those exercises?

779
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:20,438
- Yeah, we wrote each
other Post-it notes,

780
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,399
and he put his
arm round me once.

781
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:26,111
- None of that felt good to you?

782
01:04:26,113 --> 01:04:27,946
- I'm not saying that it
didn't feel good, it's just...

783
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:37,789
- Mark, how about you
share some appreciations

784
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,499
with Jonah.

785
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,710
Pick a couple of things
that Jonah did this week

786
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:43,545
that made you feel appreciated.

787
01:04:52,014 --> 01:04:53,638
- No, I just don't.

788
01:04:56,727 --> 01:04:58,059
- Take your time.

789
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:05,066
- No.

790
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:09,696
I know you have this
system, and you know,

791
01:05:09,698 --> 01:05:12,657
doing these exercises,
it's hard for me.

792
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:19,414
- We had a really fucking
romantic date night.

793
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,666
- We were high.

794
01:05:22,753 --> 01:05:24,169
- Yeah, because you drugged me.

795
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:29,090
- I just feel like
I'm banging my head

796
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,051
against the wrong wall.

797
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:32,636
- [Therapist] What do you mean?

798
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,932
- Maybe you should be with
someone more like you,

799
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:38,600
and maybe I need--

800
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:43,313
I can't get to where
you need me to be, okay?

801
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:44,606
We're spending all
this fucking money

802
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:46,983
doing all these exercises and,

803
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:48,777
maybe we're not
right for each other.

804
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:50,612
Maybe I just don't
love you any more.

805
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:58,370
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--

806
01:05:58,372 --> 01:05:59,829
- No.

807
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:13,969
- [Radio] But first, cousin
Charles was infatuated with her,

808
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:16,638
and they became secretly
engaged before he left

809
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,641
in 1642 to serve in the army

810
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:22,477
in Germany for three years.

811
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,896
Christina revealed
in her autobiography

812
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:28,692
that she felt an insurmountable
distaste for marriage,

813
01:06:28,694 --> 01:06:30,485
and an insurmountable distaste

814
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:34,406
for all the things that
females talked about and did.

815
01:06:34,408 --> 01:06:36,533
She slept for
three hours a night

816
01:06:36,535 --> 01:06:39,202
and was chiefly occupied
with her studies.

817
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:12,027
(distorted drums)

818
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:19,909
(doorbell rings)

819
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:31,296
- [Kyle] Want
another drink, babe?

820
01:07:31,298 --> 01:07:32,213
- Sure.

821
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,554
How long have you lived here?

822
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:44,559
- [Kyle] A couple of years,
it's my buddy's parents' place.

823
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:48,146
I made this one kind of strong.

824
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:49,397
- Perfect, thanks.

825
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,447
How have you been?

826
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,282
- Good.

827
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:00,325
You?

828
01:08:00,327 --> 01:08:03,203
- Mmhm, really good.

829
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:05,413
- I know.

830
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:10,919
Just kidding, I, thanks a lot.

831
01:08:12,631 --> 01:08:14,964
I better look good, I've
been working out twice a day.

832
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:16,216
- Twice a day, huh?

833
01:08:16,218 --> 01:08:17,634
- Yeah, getting
ready for this movie.

834
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:18,885
- Right, right.

835
01:08:20,639 --> 01:08:24,516
(porn plays from indoors)

836
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,227
Do you mind if we turn that off?

837
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:31,397
- Oh, you don't like porn?

838
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:35,568
- I do, it's just,
it's weird. It's weird.

839
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,277
- Is it--

840
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,070
- Yeah.

841
01:08:37,072 --> 01:08:38,113
- Okay.

842
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:28,997
- Hi.

843
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,000
- Um, hi.

844
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:42,385
What are you doing?

845
01:09:44,014 --> 01:09:45,013
- What?

846
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:47,682
- You're holding my hand.

847
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,351
- Uh, yeah.

848
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:55,565
- So?

849
01:09:57,027 --> 01:09:57,984
- I still...

850
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:00,862
I still think of you sometimes.

851
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:03,489
- Really?

852
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:04,532
- Mmhm.

853
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:12,874
- How about you?

854
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:19,214
- This is a hook up, right?

855
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:20,548
Let's hook up.

856
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:46,866
- [Nicole] He met someone.

857
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:50,119
- He tell you that?

858
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:51,663
- [Nicole] Nope, I saw them.

859
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:55,625
- Doing what?

860
01:10:55,627 --> 01:10:58,294
- [Nicole] Having dinner at
some restaurant on 3rd Street.

861
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:01,089
- It doesn't have
to mean anything.

862
01:11:01,091 --> 01:11:03,132
- [Nicole] Then they
made out in his car.

863
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:04,342
She's like, 40.

864
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,262
You know, he's
always had this thing

865
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:09,806
for women in their late 40s?

866
01:11:09,808 --> 01:11:12,433
I can't compete with
that, thank god.

867
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:17,730
But whatever, if that's
his, then that's his thing.

868
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:18,982
- You should talk to him.

869
01:11:18,984 --> 01:11:22,110
- Are you kidding? You
know, this is my idea.

870
01:11:22,112 --> 01:11:23,945
I just cannot leave shit alone.

871
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:28,449
Fuck, I'm so sorry,
how is Jonah?

872
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:29,951
- He's good.

873
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:31,327
No, we're good.

874
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:48,303
- Eva, I have your stuff.

875
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:49,304
- [Eva] Okay.

876
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:52,265
- Forgot to bring it yesterday.

877
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:58,104
What's up?

878
01:11:58,106 --> 01:12:00,064
- She was waiting outside.

879
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:07,238
- Hello Markus.

880
01:12:08,867 --> 01:12:10,158
- Isabelle?

881
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:35,154
(he sobs)

882
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,248
- [Man] Name?

883
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,666
- Miller, Mark.

884
01:15:48,002 --> 01:15:50,419
- [Man] There you are.

885
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:52,755
All right, here we go,
tell us your name, sir?

886
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:55,174
- Hi, Mark Miller.

887
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:57,093
- [Man] And, hands, please?

888
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:01,973
Profiles.

889
01:16:07,564 --> 01:16:08,980
You were here for
the explanation?

890
01:16:08,982 --> 01:16:09,897
- [Mark] Yes.

891
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:11,315
- Okay, here we go.

892
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:12,817
So, you're gonna start in
the corner of the room,

893
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:15,069
you're gonna walk in, speak
directly to the camera,

894
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,445
real friendly.

895
01:16:20,368 --> 01:16:23,911
- Hi, I'm your online
concierge, where may I take you?

896
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:30,167
- All right, let's do
one that's real warm.

897
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:42,888
- Hi, I'm your online
concierge, where may I take you?

898
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,724
- Okay, just talk to me.

899
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:53,024
And, here we go, and...

900
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,822
- Hi, I'm your online
concierge, where may I take you?

901
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:04,785
- [Man] Okay, can we pick up
the energy, just a little bit?

902
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,624
Corner, corner.

903
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:16,213
- You know what, I'm good.

904
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:17,506
- [Man] What?

905
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,134
- I'm good.

906
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,761
- [Man] I gotta keep moving.

907
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:24,722
- Okay.

908
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,287
Listen, I know that
this is what you do,

909
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:53,250
and you're very nice, I
don't wanna offend you,

910
01:17:53,252 --> 01:17:54,418
it's just...

911
01:17:56,839 --> 01:18:00,633
It just didn't work
for us, for me.

912
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:03,928
- [Therapist] I'm very
sorry to hear that.

913
01:18:06,683 --> 01:18:08,224
- You're so full of shit.

914
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,478
- I'm so sorry, Jonah.

915
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,274
You're a really
kind, amazing man.

916
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,529
I've never met anybody with
a bigger heart than you.

917
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:25,116
Fuck, you deserve someone
who doesn't have to work

918
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:28,160
so fucking hard
to be nice to you,

919
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:30,287
who likes being in the
same room with you.

920
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:32,873
I'm not that person.

921
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:35,084
I'm not.

922
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:37,503
I'm never going to be.

923
01:19:11,456 --> 01:19:12,580
Thank you.

924
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:14,874
- For?

925
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:18,586
- I dunno.

926
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:20,504
Just thank you.

927
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:22,631
- Yeah.

928
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:27,762
- Okay.

929
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:28,763
- Come on.

930
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:43,068
Okay.

931
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:04,650
(phone buzzes)

932
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:53,073
(phone rings)

933
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:22,621
- It's good.

934
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:24,915
- Told you.

935
01:23:52,028 --> 01:23:53,027
- Hey.

936
01:24:12,757 --> 01:24:13,756
Hey.

937
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:16,717
- Hi.

938
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:20,095
- How are you?

939
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:22,347
- I'm good, how are you?

940
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:23,265
- Good.

941
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:29,897
- I thought you weren't coming.

942
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:31,982
- Changed my mind.

943
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:33,484
Come on, I'd never
hear the end of it.

944
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:38,572
This is weird, huh?

945
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:39,990
- Yeah, a little.

946
01:24:42,036 --> 01:24:43,744
It's good to see you.

947
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:44,912
- Me too.

948
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,084
Have you seen 'em yet?

949
01:24:50,086 --> 01:24:52,586
- I saw Craig go upstairs
with a bottle of wine,

950
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:54,838
I think Nicole must be
panicking about something.

951
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:58,509
- Nicole panicking?
No way. (laughs)

952
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:05,057
- She said you're
not acting any more.

953
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:07,518
- Yeah.

954
01:25:09,105 --> 01:25:12,397
Haven't enjoyed it in
a long time, you know?

955
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:15,359
- [Jonah] What are you gonna do?

956
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:16,860
- I have no idea.

957
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:22,282
You look good.

958
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:26,745
- Thank you.

959
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:30,582
- My father died.

960
01:25:31,836 --> 01:25:33,877
A while ago.

961
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:34,962
I never told you.

962
01:25:36,799 --> 01:25:38,632
I'm sorry.

963
01:25:50,146 --> 01:25:53,897
Anyway, I...

964
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:00,988
- What is this?

965
01:26:02,408 --> 01:26:04,283
- Open it.

966
01:26:04,285 --> 01:26:05,492
- Mark, I don't know.

967
01:26:07,288 --> 01:26:09,329
I'll read it later.

968
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:10,247
- Okay.

969
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:23,260
Dear Jonah,

970
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:27,389
this is a list, in
no particular order,

971
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:29,266
of some of the things that
I appreciate about you

972
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:30,851
and will never forget.

973
01:26:32,313 --> 01:26:34,438
If you ever think of me
sometime in the future,

974
01:26:36,609 --> 01:26:39,276
I hope you don't just
remember the bad moments,

975
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:42,654
but some of the beautiful
ones we shared as well.

976
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:43,947
I know I will.

977
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:48,535
Okay, like I said, in
no particular order...
