1
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hey, buddy, what the hell's
going on in here?

2
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,100
Buddy?

3
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,400
What is this, a circus?
Who are you people?

4
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
It's a waiting room. We're waiting.

5
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Well, you can wait outside, you know.
I'd carry the chairs out myself.

6
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,700
What is that?

7
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,200
It's actually, uh,
like a high-tech boomerang.

8
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,500
Let me see.

9
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,900
You need the glove.

10
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,500
The homing mechanism
is inside the glove.

11
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,100
Oh. So, who's the defendant?

12
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,200
My best friend Frank.

13
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,100
Yeah? What'd he do?
Weird stuff with animals?

14
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,700
N-no. No, no, no. Nothing like that.
It's a long story.

15
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,700
I got time.

16
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,100
Besides, you owe me.
I'm gonna have to clean up this shit.

17
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,000
Why not? Have you
ever heard of the, uh,

18
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,000
Melvin Kids 'R Kool
Toy Company?

19
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,300
Of course.

20
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,500
I remember Frank got the head
of the toy company, Ms. Melvin herself,

21
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,800
to come out and see
this great new invention.

22
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,200
This is the Boomerazoo,

23
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,300
the most amazing new toy
since Barbie.

24
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Now, the percent...

25
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,100
Please don't mention
that little slut... in our presence.

26
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,400
Right.

27
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,000
Anyway, Professor here...

28
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,700
has created the most aerodynamically
sophisticated projectile

29
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,400
this side of modern warfare.

30
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,600
All I have to do...
is set the internal gyroscope...

31
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,400
and I throw the Boomerazoo
as far as I can.

32
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,400
And with unerring accuracy,

33
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,100
it will fly in a perfect circle
and return directly to me.

34
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,000
Kids will literally be able
to play with themselves.

35
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,500
I get it.

36
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,800
The ball comes back to the glove.
Did they buy it?

37
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,100
I'm not finished yet, okay?

38
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,800
The real question is,
did they prosecute?

39
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
It hit her?

40
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,100
It hit her because she had
a metal plate in her head.

41
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,900
It acted like a magnet.

42
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,300
So, is she all right?

43
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,200
Well...

44
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,200
She lived.

45
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,500
My dreams of the Boomerazoo
hittin' pay dirt are over.

46
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,500
Well, it hit something.
It just wasn't pay dirt.

47
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,900
I should think by now
failure would be easy for you to handle.

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,600
Thanks a lot.

49
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,000
You're the one who wanted to pursue
a career as a full-time dreamer.

50
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,100
Get these missiles out of here!

51
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,400
If it wasn't for dreamers,

52
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,500
there wouldn't be any automobiles,
air conditioning, quilted toilet paper...

53
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,100
Or the hovercraft golf cart,
or the Tofu fast food chain...

54
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,000
I was very close on that one.
The drought in Malaysia killed it.

55
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,900
Oh, and here's my favorite...
Women's Professional Mall Wrestling.

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,300
I like that one.

57
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,100
- Mall owners have no imagination.
- Go get your schoolbooks.

58
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,500
Why don't you get a job?

59
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,100
Live off somebody else's ingenuity
for a change.

60
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,000
Any idiot can get a job, Leona.

61
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,000
Apparently not.

62
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,000
Uncle Frank, Mommy says
you're a lazy bastard. Is that true?

63
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,500
Nick, watch your language.

64
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,300
I didn't say "lazy bastard,"
I said "crazy bastard."

65
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,200
- Get that plate out of here.
- Nice. You turn my nephew against me.

66
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,800
Why don't you have him grow up
to be a stockbroker

67
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,600
or an accountant or something,
or worse off, a lawyer.

68
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,100
Oh! I should be so lucky. And where
do you get off badmouthing lawyers?

69
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,000
If you'd continued practicing law,
your life wouldn't be so miserable!

70
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,600
I quit 'cause I don't want
my life to be miserable.

71
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,600
What are you gonna do?
Sit around moping?

72
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,400
- Go outside and do something!
- Yeah, like what?

73
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,200
Like maybe get Mom
a birthday present.

74
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,800
Think she'd like a Boomerazoo?

75
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,200
Okay, go on.
So, your friend' in trouble...

76
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,600
The trouble with my friend Frank
is that he' always in trouble.

77
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,500
He would always come to me,
like he did that day.

78
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,900
So, what's so important
that I had to close my shop?

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,500
Gotta go buy my mother
a birthday gift.

80
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,900
I closed my shop so I could help you
buy a birthday gift for your mom?

81
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,700
Actually, I just needed
someone to talk to.

82
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm washed up, man.
I struck out again.

83
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,600
Boomerazoo's a bust.

84
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,000
Forget it. You're not washed up.

85
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,700
You gotta keep swingin'.
Don't let it get to you.

86
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,700
You need to relax,
have some fun...

87
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,200
do something to get
your mind off your troubles.

88
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,900
Don't let it get to you, Frank.

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,800
We've been friends for ten years,
and I have faith in you.

90
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,400
You've had a hundred great ideas.

91
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,700
None of them ever worked,

92
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,000
but you always got off the floor
and came out swingin'.

93
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,800
Thanks for your vote of confidence.

94
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,400
You're Frank Hopper,
man with a million ideas...

95
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,600
several of which made sense.

96
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,400
Well, I'm out of ideas, Carl.
I'm runnin' on empty.

97
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,300
You're just in a slump,
but I know how your mind works.

98
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,100
When you least expect it,
you see something that has

99
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,300
nothing to do with anything,
and that's when it hits you!

100
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,200
Well, that pot of gold at the end
of that rainbow is further away than ever.

101
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,600
At least you have
a sister who supports you.

102
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,500
She doesn't support me.
She puts me up to watch Nicky.

103
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,800
This is it.

104
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,800
Look at this. My mother'll love it.

105
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,500
See, great ideas still happen.

106
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,000
What the hell is it?

107
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,400
An ass warmer.

108
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,300
Why didn't I think of it?

109
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,100
Good idea.
You should've thought of it.

110
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,600
$139.09. How would you like
to pay for that, sir, cash or credit?

111
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,400
Cash.

112
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,200
We're doing a store survey
to see who our customers are.

113
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,400
Would you like to fill one out?
You get a free pen, and I make $2.

114
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Sure, I can always use another pen.

115
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,200
What do you think... me or...

116
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,900
Oh, no, definitely you.

117
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,600
You wanna fill one out?
You get a free pen.

118
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,400
No, thanks.
I have enough pens.

119
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,200
You have enough pens?

120
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Good evening, Moneypenny.

121
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,700
I do believe I'll be driving
the Aston Martin this evening.

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,900
Who is it?

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,300
Publishers Clearing House. You lost.

124
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,500
Who do you think it is?

125
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,700
Wait a minute.
The guy lives in a garage?

126
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,100
He's actually moving up in the world.
He used to live in my basement.

127
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,900
I really appreciate
you doing this for me tonight.

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,800
You said you'd evict me if I didn't.

129
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,500
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

130
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,100
You should tell her the story.

131
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,300
Crab cakes, anyone?
Crab cakes?

132
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
No, thank you.

133
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,400
Don't I know you from AA?

134
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,200
That's right. I slipped.

135
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,600
Crab cakes?

136
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,100
Thank you very much.

137
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,100
Frank! What are you doing?

138
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,500
I told the partners
I'd oversee the party.

139
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,200
Don't embarrass me.

140
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,700
It'll be fine.

141
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,400
Frank.

142
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,100
Jessica.

143
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,900
It's good to see you.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,700
It's good to see you, too.
You look beautiful.

145
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,500
Honey, I've been looking
all over for you.

146
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,500
This is Norman Brown.
Norman, Frank Hopper.

147
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,000
Pleasure to meet you.
You're... Jessica's ex-beau, right?

148
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,500
Are you a waiter?

149
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,800
Oh, no. No.
Just hungry.

150
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,100
Jess'll tell ya,
I'm a sucker for crab cakes.

151
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,000
What do you do, Norman?

152
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,800
I'm the assistant D.A.

153
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,600
Wanna try one?

154
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,900
No, thank you.

155
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,600
Excuse me, waiter,
may I try one of those?

156
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,800
Oh, sorry, pal... l'm not a waiter.

157
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,300
Assistant D.A., huh?

158
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,900
If I'm not mistaken, you are a waiter,
and I don't appreciate your attitude.

159
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,800
Listen, buddy, I'm just...

160
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,500
- Oh, my...
- What...

161
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,900
- Oh, you stupid...
- I'm so, so, so sorry.

162
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,400
- Get off of me!
- Excuse me.

163
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,300
- I didn't mean to do that.
- Jerk-off!

164
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,600
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. I'm so, so sor...

165
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,400
Holy mother of...

166
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,700
Honey, he's drowning
the little person!

167
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,600
Who was that man?

168
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,000
Hank, do something!

169
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,400
Like what?

170
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,100
Is he all right?

171
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,000
I saw what that guy did to you.

172
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,500
You'd be well within
your rights to... sue!

173
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,100
Stop him!

174
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,500
Go help him.

175
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,800
What do you want me to do?

176
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,800
Get me his name!

177
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,900
Let me help you.

178
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,500
That's the last time I ask him
to work a party.

179
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,700
I'm gonna call it the World Wide
Women' Hockey League.

180
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,500
The World Wide
Women's Hockey League?

181
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,800
This sounds like another
Professional Women's Mall Wrestling.

182
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,600
Why would anyone want to watch
a bunch of toothless women

183
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,000
with thick ankles and bulky clothing
beating each other with sticks?

184
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,000
Men love to watch women
beat the hell out of each other.

185
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,900
They're gonna be beautiful women.
They'll have their teeth.

186
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,300
How'd you come up
with this incredible idea?

187
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,400
Jessica fell on a floor full of ice.
She knocked out two other women.

188
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,600
Then this crab cake
almost took my head off.

189
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,200
Makes sense to me.

190
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,800
Oh, your limo has arrived.

191
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,800
Right on time.

192
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,700
Hi, kids.

193
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,200
Hi, Frank!

194
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:16,600
Did you do your homework
last night?

195
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,300
Did you do your homework
last night?

196
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,600
Good girl.

197
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,500
Nicky! My favorite nephew.
Brought you a hot dog.

198
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,800
What's up, Nick?

199
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,900
Stanley, whassup!

200
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
Just chillin'.

201
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm telling you, Carl,
World Wide Women's Hockey.

202
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,200
This is the home run
I've been waitin' for.

203
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,400
Think about it. The WNBA,
women's basketball, very successful.

204
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,200
There's millions of hockey fans
out there like us.

205
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,000
You'd watch women
play hockey, wouldn't ya?

206
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,400
Are they topless?

207
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,900
Turn around. Do your homework.

208
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,700
Another victim of Internet porn.

209
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,400
It's gonna cost a lot of money.

210
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,800
Tiny skates, and her ice skates
and outfits alone cost me a bundle.

211
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,000
So?

212
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,400
- So?
- So.

213
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,300
So last time I checked,
you were so broke

214
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
you had to scrimp change
from the couch to buy lunch.

215
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,300
Just a bump in the road, my friend.

216
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Somehow, someway, the universe
provides for those who wait.

217
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,900
I've waited long enough.
This could be the start of something big.

218
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,300
I could feel it.

219
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,800
Hold it, hold it.
What was your buddy thinking?

220
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,200
Women?! Playing hockey?!

221
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's unnatural!

222
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,800
But then, who needs
natural, anyway?

223
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,900
Exactly.

224
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,300
So, he had the idea, but of course
he didn't have the money to pull it off.

225
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,600
Then, it happened.

226
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,900
God came through.

227
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,300
Yes!

228
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
You just never take me out.

229
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,200
We never go anywhere.

230
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,600
You spend a lot more time with
miserable Frank than you do with me!

231
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,200
He's going through
a tough time right now.

232
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,800
He's my best friend.

233
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,800
And what am I, chopped liver?

234
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,900
I'm telling you now,

235
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,300
this relationship is goin' nowhere.

236
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,100
There are a lot more guys
who treat me better than you!

237
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,300
I bought you lunch
three times this week.

238
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,600
This isn't lunch!
It's... it's food!

239
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,700
Ask and ye shall receive.

240
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Pre-approved!

241
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,100
It's a mistake.

242
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,900
You don't even have
a bank account.

243
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,500
They must realize my potential.

244
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,100
Potential bankruptcy.

245
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,800
Hey, who am I to argue
with these people?

246
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,600
They know everything
about everybody.

247
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,000
They got computers now
that can tell the future.

248
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,400
They know precisely who's gonna win
the Super Bowl months in advance.

249
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,900
You don't know, 'cause they
don't wanna spoil the TV ratings.

250
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,500
Anyway, nowadays,
everybody's got a credit card.

251
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,300
I understand that, but you?

252
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,100
Well, maybe I'm turning
a new page in my life.

253
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,800
I hope it turns out better
than the rest of the book.

254
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Come on!

255
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,900
Go home, get changed.
Tonight we celebrate.

256
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,500
He gets one credit card,

257
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,200
and all of a sudden
to Frank, it' Christmas.

258
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,600
Trouble was, it was September.

259
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Frank, you're nuts.

260
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,000
You're charging way too much.

261
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,100
Credit card companies
are not Santa Claus.

262
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,500
- At some point, you have to pay.
- I'm gonna pay.

263
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,400
When the W.W.W.H.L.
Hits it big, and it will,

264
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,700
I will pay it all back with interest.

265
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,200
Yeah, a lot of interest.

266
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,500
Mere pennies, my friend.
Can you take the tree?

267
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,600
Frank, you here?

268
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,500
We're in the living room, Leona!

269
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,200
Whose car is that out there?

270
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,000
What the hell's going on here?

271
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,200
It's not Christmas.

272
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,900
Merry Extra Christmas.

273
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,900
And these presents under the tree?
They're for you... and for you.

274
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,000
Nick, buddy! Left one out.
This one's got your name on it.

275
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,900
Check it out. This big package
here is a new video game.

276
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,300
You'll love it!
You can kill millions of people.

277
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,900
- Well, Frank...
- Wow, just what I wanted!

278
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,600
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

279
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,800
Nothing. I just wanna show
my appreciation for helping me out

280
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,800
and putting me up
these last few years.

281
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,300
You're welcome.

282
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,800
So, what happened?
Super Lotto?

283
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,800
Knock off a Brink's truck? What?

284
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,600
I can assume it isn't a job.

285
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,100
Want some more champagne?

286
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,500
Carl, you want
some champagne?

287
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Absolutely.

288
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,500
It's an enterprise.

289
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,400
I have an important meeting tomorrow
with some big investors.

290
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
They wanna get in
on the ground floor.

291
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,700
An enterprise?

292
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
An enterprise
that actually earns you money?

293
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,000
Yeah... you know, in the future.

294
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,300
Make us even more
than it's making us now.

295
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,500
An enterprise that earns you
enough money to rent a new car

296
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,200
and buy all these sorts of gifts?

297
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Is this enterprise legal?

298
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
Leona, I'm hurt
you'd even ask me that.

299
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm not gonna bail you out this time.

300
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,600
You're not gonna have
to bail me out of anything.

301
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,100
Merry Christmas.

302
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
potential investors...

303
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,800
welcome to the opportunity
of a lifetime.

304
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,800
Now, I believe that the project
I'm about to propose

305
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,900
can and will turn a profit
in less than 16 months.

306
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,100
It is a virtual goldmine on ice.

307
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,200
I like to call it the Three-W.H.L.

308
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,300
The World Wide
Women's Hockey League.

309
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,300
Women's Hockey?

310
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,700
That's the worst idea
I've ever heard in my life.

311
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,900
This is worse than the guy
that tried to sell us mall wrestling.

312
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,600
So, what did they invest?

313
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,200
First we gotta start small.

314
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,700
Just two teams, beautiful women
that can really play hockey.

315
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,300
Next year, we build a fan base.

316
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,600
We start selling franchises,
merchandising, television...

317
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,600
Television, that's the big money.

318
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,100
Here it is, partner...
the new home of the W.W.W.H.L.

319
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
It's a shit hole.

320
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,900
I got some buddies comin' in tomorrow
to help clean the place up.

321
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,400
Once the ice is in,
this place'll be shining.

322
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,200
God, it's a shit hole!

323
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,500
Okay, so it needs some work.

324
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,500
We've never been afraid
of hard work before,

325
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,000
and this time we
got financial backing.

326
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,900
Keep it down over there.
I'm trying to get some sleep.

327
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,600
Who the hell is that?

328
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,900
That's Elvis.

329
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,600
He's sleeping in the net!

330
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,800
Yeah, he lives here.

331
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,200
I gotta run to Leona's.
I got a couple errands.

332
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,500
Can you pick up
that hockey gear?

333
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,300
I'll meet you back here.
Thanks, brother.

334
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,100
What are you looking at?

335
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,800
Hey! Hey, wait up!

336
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,900
Jess, wait up!

337
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,000
Hi.

338
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,800
You here to see Leona?

339
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,200
I just thought I'd take a spin
around her driveway.

340
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,400
Nice wheels.

341
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,900
- Yours?
- Yeah.

342
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,600
Things are going great.
I got a new line of work.

343
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,200
I'm in sports promotion.

344
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,900
Really? What are you promoting?
Midget wrestling?

345
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,700
It's the World Wide
Women's Hockey League.

346
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,000
You should come
check it out sometime.

347
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,500
I don't think so.

348
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,400
You could bring the boyfriend.

349
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,700
We broke up.

350
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,600
Really? Then you should definitely
come by and check it out.

351
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,400
We'll see.

352
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,300
Hey, Elvis. Here you go.

353
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,600
What is this?

354
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,300
Turkey sandwich.

355
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,100
Oh, I can't eat this shit, man.
I'm a vegan.

356
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,000
How about a veggie burger?

357
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

358
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,000
I got you a turkey sandwich.

359
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,800
Thanks, man.
Phone's been ringin' off the hook.

360
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,800
People put in bids for food service.
A publicist and the uniforms guy called.

361
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,400
- Wants to set up a meeting.
- What about the advertising?

362
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,700
- Ads in the local papers and the Internet.
- Anything else?

363
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,500
The work crew showed up.
We had to pile up all that crap.

364
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,100
Let me show you what we did.

365
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,000
You're my partner, man,
and I got something better.

366
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,900
- What?
- We got the Coliseum opening night.

367
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Col... the Coliseum?

368
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,500
Holy shit!
How'd you swing that?

369
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,100
They take credit cards.

370
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,700
- Credit Card Central.
- Credit Card Central.

371
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,100
Hold on just another moment...

372
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
One moment, please.

373
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,900
- Credit Card Central.
- Credit Card Central.

374
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,400
How many? How much?

375
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,800
Oh, yeah. I'll get right on it. Yes!

376
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,000
I know you're out there.
I know you're out there.

377
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,200
You can run,
but you can't hide.

378
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,100
Mr. Hopper, I'm gonna keep
an eye on you.

379
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,800
Oh, this is great.

380
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,200
Lookin' good, man!

381
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,700
Too many people in here.
It's a zoo.

382
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,400
Nice turnout, huh?

383
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,800
Certainly is!

384
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,900
- Never gonna sleep in this...
- Elvis, blow the horn.

385
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,500
A little louder.

386
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,100
All right, that's it!
Good job! Yeah!

387
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,200
Good morning!

388
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Good morning.

389
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,900
Welcome,
and thank you all for coming.

390
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,500
As you know, these tryouts
are for the first two teams

391
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,100
of the World Wide
Women's Hockey League.

392
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,600
Now, the coaches, my associate,
and I will be watching you very carefully.

393
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,700
This is the start of something big.

394
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,500
You could be a part
of something very special.

395
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,200
Number 17!
Number 7!

396
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,700
32!

397
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,900
Number 11!

398
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,500
Number 13!

399
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,100
Wow.

400
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
All right.

401
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,900
Number 21!

402
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,900
31! 18!

403
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,800
Number 38!

404
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,400
Okay, take a shot.

405
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,800
Get in close.

406
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,500
Here we go.

407
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,800
Good shot.

408
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,800
And... number 8!

409
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,200
Hello? I said number 8,
front and center!

410
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,700
Hello?! I said number 8!

411
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,500
You ready to make history?

412
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,700
Are you ready to make history?

413
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,400
Okay, number 36!

414
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,900
Hey, Tiny.

415
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,600
Why aren't you doing
Ice Capades or something?

416
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,100
I done that. No fun.

417
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,500
I'm dying to knock
the shit out of somebody.

418
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,700
How come your girlfriend's here?

419
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,200
Tiny's a skater.
She's a good skater.

420
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,500
Number 26!

421
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,100
But she's a figure skater.
This can get pretty rough, you know.

422
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,800
Trust me. She can get
pretty rough, too.

423
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,100
Well, that was fantastic.
That about wraps things up.

424
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,500
The names of those chosen
will be posted on the locker room wall,

425
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,700
and our first full practice in pads
will be Monday.

426
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,300
We're in business, Coach.

427
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,300
Wait! Please wait!

428
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,200
Can I help you, pal?

429
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,600
L... I already tried that one, brother.

430
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,500
Hey, this guy said I can't try out!

431
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,900
This tryout's for women only.

432
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,000
I am a woman!
Wendy Delvecchio from Steubenville.

433
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,600
I'm sorry I'm late.

434
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,600
Just give her a chance.
I'm blacking out here, man.

435
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,700
What we have here
is a hockey player.

436
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,900
Man, we gotta have a face-off.

437
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,300
Anybody wanna take a face-off
against Wendy?

438
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,500
Excuse me, but does anybody
wanna get hit by a truck?

439
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,500
No. I'll pass until we get pads.

440
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,500
Yeah, uh, I think I'll just watch.

441
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,400
I'll do it.

442
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,800
So, what do you think?

443
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,500
- Do your thing.
- All right.

444
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,700
Um, h-honey...

445
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,600
You sure, Tiny? She's pretty big.

446
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,300
Hey, it's hockey,
and I'm a skater.

447
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,000
And I'm tough, okay?

448
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,200
I mean, what could happen?

449
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
So, uh, a couple
of months then, huh?

450
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Honey, it looks like a concussion,
a broken arm, and three fractured ribs.

451
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,500
You'll be okay
in a couple of months.

452
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,800
I'll bring some lunch
to the hospital!

453
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,500
It's "lavatories," you know,
with a "V," not a "B."

454
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,200
Lavatory.

455
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Oh... yeah.

456
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,000
Sorry, man. Had my mind
on something else.

457
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,500
Tiny left me.

458
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,000
She moved in
with the paramedic.

459
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,900
I'm sorry to hear that.
That's pretty funny.

460
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,300
It's okay.
I'm kinda lonely, though.

461
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,400
We ate lunch together a lot,
you know?

462
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,200
I'll buy you lunch.
Don't worry about it.

463
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,300
- Thanks.
- Hello?

464
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,100
Yeah. I'll call you back.

465
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,700
Hey! My two favorite lawyers!

466
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,500
- Hi.
- Hey.

467
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,400
I'm gonna go take
another look at the rink.

468
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,600
So, this is
the practice arena. Wow.

469
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,300
How 'bout if I show you around?

470
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,500
Yeah.

471
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,400
And this is
the Almighty Swans' locker room.

472
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
Foxes have one just like it.

473
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,800
Wow.

474
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,100
Got something else
I wanna show you.

475
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,600
Wanna see the hot tub?

476
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,500
Yeah.

477
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,800
Remember the hot tub?

478
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,800
Yeah.

479
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,500
Can I get you anything?

480
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,500
The cot you gave me
is murder on my back.

481
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,100
See what I have to put up with?

482
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,800
I could really use a massage.

483
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,500
Jess, we had a pretty good thing
going for a while.

484
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,000
You can't say
it wasn't a lot of fun.

485
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,700
You changed, Frank.

486
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,300
You live in a dream world,
and you never finish anything.

487
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,600
You used to be
a damn good lawyer.

488
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,500
Then, I don't know
what happened.

489
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
You became...

490
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,800
you became this.

491
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,600
I know, but it's different now.

492
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,600
This isn't a dream.
This is real.

493
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,000
And I've changed.

494
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,900
I'm on to something,
and it could be a winner.

495
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,300
I'm gonna be dependable,

496
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,300
and I'm gonna take this
all the way.

497
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,000
I hope so...

498
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,500
Mr. Dependable.

499
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,500
Elvis, what the hell
are you doing?

500
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,000
My laundry.

501
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,600
So, what do you say?

502
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,500
What do I say to what?

503
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,000
Dinner tonight.

504
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,400
Okay, I'll have dinner with you.

505
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,100
But just dinner, Frank.

506
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,000
Just dinner, no funny stuff.

507
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,800
Absolutely.

508
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,800
No funny stuff.

509
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,000
Come back here.

510
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,500
That was great.

511
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,100
Frank, we were
always good at that part.

512
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,100
It's the other stuff we mess up.

513
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,600
Let's just stay in bed.

514
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,700
We're not starting all over again.

515
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,500
This was just something
that happened.

516
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,900
We'll take it nice and slow and see.

517
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,700
No funny stuff?

518
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,600
Well.

519
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,700
Maybe a little funny stuff.

520
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
You look pretty.
Do you have a date?

521
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,600
Skip's picking me up at 9:30,
so I got about 10 minutes.

522
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,900
His van's parked outside.
I just saw him.

523
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
- Really? Oh, wow.
- Yeah, he's there.

524
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,100
See you later.

525
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,600
Oh, yeah, who's your daddy?

526
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,100
Hey, you'd better be talking
to your kid in there!

527
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,300
Skip!

528
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,400
Skip, open the goddamn door!

529
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,600
Skip, I'm gonna break this door off!

530
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,700
They're always at it.

531
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,100
Oh, my God!

532
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,600
Hey, babe. I was just coming in.

533
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,200
Yeah, I noticed.
Who's she?

534
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,300
Just a chick that I met
who needed a lift.

535
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,200
You were giving her more than a lift.
You were fucking her!

536
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,700
- What are you talking about?
- I saw it with my own eyes.

537
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,900
You having trouble
with your eyes?

538
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,500
- My eyes are perfect!
- I guess they're not.

539
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,200
- Come on, let's go.
- Fuck you.

540
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,700
I said let's go!

541
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,000
And I said fuck you!

542
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Son of a bitch!

543
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,000
Oh, man.

544
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,300
Morning, Elvis.

545
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,500
Could we get a subscription
to the New York Times?

546
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,800
This crossword puzzle's
a real turd.

547
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,300
Little chilly in here last night.
I was shivering in my sleep.

548
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,000
It's an ice rink.

549
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,400
This place was better without the ice.

550
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,000
I'll get you an ass warmer.

551
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,700
Ass warmer? Great invention.
Everything was coming together.

552
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,600
The girls were kicking butt in practice,
and they looked awesome.

553
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,300
Damn.

554
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,900
That locker room
must have been smokin'.

555
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,300
No, I mean, I wouldn't know.

556
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,000
Anyway, I had other things
on my mind.

557
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,600
I found out about the "investors."

558
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Morning.

559
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,700
What's up?

560
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,000
Well, that's what I'd like to know.

561
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,500
So, I finally met some
of your phantom investors.

562
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,300
Yeah, I found these
in the back of the closet.

563
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,900
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on here?

564
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,600
They keep sending me
cards, Carl.

565
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,600
I got the first one.
I was pre-approved.

566
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,600
I start using it,
they send me six more.

567
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,500
I made the minimum
payments on those,

568
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,900
and other banks start
sending me two dozen more...

569
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,300
You're pyramiding!

570
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,500
I don't see it that way.

571
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,400
I consider it extending
my credit parameters.

572
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,400
They charge, like, 20% interest.

573
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
That's worse than pyramiding.

574
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,300
This is bad, man.

575
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,600
This is very, very bad.

576
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,800
This is not how banks loan you money
to start a new business.

577
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,600
Would a bank loan me money
to start a business the usual way?

578
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,200
- Of course not.
- I rest my case.

579
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,700
I mean, look at this!

580
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,200
Uniforms and equipment, $21,000!

581
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,900
How come you bought
144 sports bras?

582
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,100
We have 32 players.

583
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,100
That's 64 tits.

584
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,000
They gave me half off
if I bought 'em by the gross.

585
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,300
Lighten up!

586
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,700
Rental on the arena and ice-making
facilities for 6 months, $18,000!

587
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,000
Estimated weekly advertising budget
and public relations, $16,000.

588
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,400
And an evening with the world's
greatest female hockey players...

589
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,000
priceless.

590
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,400
Priceless.

591
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,800
There never were any investors,
were there, Frank?

592
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,700
I couldn't get 'em to share my vision.

593
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,100
We are so screwed.

594
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,300
Carl, listen to me.

595
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,200
The way I see this,

596
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,900
the credit card companies
are the investors, all right?

597
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,900
This is so easy.

598
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,600
All we have to do is keep making
the minimum payments.

599
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,900
Keeps them off our back.

600
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
As soon as the league is a success,
I pay everything off.

601
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,900
But Frank, we haven't even
played our first game yet.

602
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,600
What if the league's not a success?

603
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,500
I refuse to even let
that thought enter my mind.

604
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,500
Hey, did you know that China's

605
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,500
the second-largest
credit card nation in the world?

606
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,700
I assume you're the first.

607
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,500
Holy shit. What a mess.

608
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,200
What?

609
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,400
...masturbate!

610
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,900
She wants to know how long
the jury's gonna be masturbating.

611
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,700
Oh, deliberate. Juries deliberate.

612
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,400
I have no idea.

613
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,000
We just have to relax.

614
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,300
Relax?

615
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,900
Yeah.

616
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,800
Relax.

617
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Relax.

618
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,800
Broken!

619
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,600
I love the French.

620
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,100
Oui, oui.

621
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,700
Wait a minute.
You've gone too far, Mr. Hopper.

622
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,200
You have crossed the line.

623
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,800
You're finished, done, history.

624
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,800
I'm going right to the top
with this one.

625
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,900
Got you.

626
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,200
What do you think, Chief?

627
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,200
This has become
a personal matter, gentlemen.

628
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,800
String him up by the balls.

629
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,700
Okay, ladies.

630
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,100
Great job. That's it for today.

631
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,100
Let's hit the showers.

632
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,500
Gotta hit 'em harder, Salina.

633
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,300
Gotta move faster
and use that stick more, Danielle.

634
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Right.

635
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,800
You look sharp out there, Wendy.
Everything okay?

636
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,800
I think I gotta quit, Frank.

637
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,700
Quit? You can't quit.
Tomorrow night's the first game.

638
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,500
My boyfriend cheated on me.

639
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,700
I'm going through
a very emotional time.

640
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,700
I'm fucking devastated.

641
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,900
Seemed like an all right guy.
I mean, you got a good thing going?

642
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,500
No, he had no class.
We beat the hell out of each other, but...

643
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,600
underneath all this muscle
I'm very feminine, Frank.

644
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,900
I need a man.

645
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,600
You'll find someone, Wendy.

646
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,600
A woman of your imposing stature,
you'll find someone.

647
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,400
I don't know.
Men seem to be afraid of me.

648
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,100
Baby, you're just going through
a tough time right now.

649
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,100
These things always got a way
of working themselves out.

650
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,000
Take it from me.
Look, I know.

651
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,000
I must have broke up
with my girl 20, 30 times,

652
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,900
and we're back together again.

653
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,100
Thatta girl.

654
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,400
I know a great guy
who'd love to take you out to dinner,

655
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,300
help you forget
about your problems.

656
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,800
- What do you say? I'll call him.
- Okay.

657
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,100
- All right?
- Yeah.

658
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,300
No way.

659
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,100
Come on, she's a very nice girl,
and you're lonely.

660
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,400
No.

661
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,700
She's very sensitive.

662
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,900
No.

663
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,800
Her boyfriend was cheating on her.

664
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,400
She just lost her boyfriend.
You just lost a girlfriend.

665
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,800
And she's lonely.

666
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,000
Well, rent her a gorilla.

667
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,300
I mean, what am I,
a goddamn escort service

668
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,500
for women who are bigger,
stronger, and tougher than I am,

669
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,800
but not as attractive?

670
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,400
At least I didn't fracture
my girlfriend's jaw.

671
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,200
Carl, she's the best player we got.

672
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,500
Don't you think it makes sense
to make her happy?

673
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,400
Fine, but why me?

674
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,700
There's some people around here
starting to wonder about your...

675
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,800
sexual orientation.

676
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,600
Come on, you rent a limo,
get her some flowers or something.

677
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,000
Here's the cards.
Get yourself some cash.

678
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,400
Codes are right in the bag.

679
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,400
Attaboy.
You take one for the team.

680
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,500
And you say
some nice things to her.

681
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,300
She's a very fragile flower.

682
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Yeah.

683
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,600
I want all the credit cards,
all the code numbers,

684
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,300
or you're a dead man.

685
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,500
Dead.

686
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,200
Be my guest.

687
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,700
What happened to you?

688
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,700
I got mugged.

689
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,200
They get the money?

690
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,700
Not a cent.

691
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,100
They get the credit cards?

692
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,800
I gave him the cards,
but then he gave them back.

693
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,000
That's when he decked me.

694
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,000
'Cause you wouldn't
give him the codes?

695
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,000
I gave him the codes.

696
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,200
He hit me because
he couldn't get any money.

697
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,100
You're all maxed out.

698
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,800
This guy who held me up,
he said even his credit cards were good.

699
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,000
Maxed out, huh?

700
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,200
Banks... never there
when you need 'em.

701
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,800
Don't worry, I got more.

702
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,700
All right, listen to me.

703
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,400
You take my car to get Wendy,
but do me a favor.

704
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,700
Push the seat all the way back.
She needs a lot of legroom.

705
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,200
Right.

706
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,400
A lot of legroom.

707
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,000
Hi, Carl.

708
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,900
Hi.

709
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,800
You look nice.

710
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,200
Thanks.

711
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,400
I put my tooth in.

712
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,400
Wow.

713
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,100
It looks so real.

714
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,900
It is real, I just don't know
if it's mine or not.

715
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,300
You know, after a fight,
you don't know

716
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,700
whose teeth are whose,
so you just pick one up.

717
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,700
Sure, sure.

718
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,400
And a little Krazy Glue...

719
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,800
Stays pretty good.

720
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Here, this is for you.

721
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,000
The grocery store didn't have
any flowers, so I got you a plant.

722
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,800
You are the sweetest little thing.

723
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,900
This is so good.

724
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,600
Boy, when they say
"all you can eat night,"

725
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,200
they really mean you.

726
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,900
What do you mean by that?

727
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,900
Because I love a woman
with a healthy appetite.

728
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,000
Well, here we are.

729
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,800
It was a great night.

730
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm really glad
you enjoyed your dinner.

731
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,900
Would you like to come in
for a cup of tea or something?

732
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,400
I'd really love to, but I gotta be
at the arena very early tomorrow.

733
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,500
You know, it's opening night and all.

734
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,100
I understand.

735
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,900
Would you mind just, like,
coming in for a minute,

736
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,800
until I get the lights on?

737
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,400
It would make me
feel a lot safer.

738
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,600
I'm afraid of the dark.

739
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,200
Okay.

740
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,400
You're not...

741
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,000
going anywhere.

742
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,600
I mean it.

743
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,600
Fuck or fight.

744
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,700
- Hey.
- Hey, pal.

745
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,100
Is that Nick and his pals out there?

746
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,400
Yeah, playtime.

747
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,600
How'd it go last night?

748
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,200
Well, after they took me off oxygen

749
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,500
and I got out of the emergency room

750
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,200
and went back to her apartment...

751
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,000
You dog!

752
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,500
Best goddamn night of my life!

753
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,900
What's this?

754
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,300
That's a friendship puck.

755
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,900
Wendy gave it to me.

756
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,000
Yeah, and I still
carry it with me wherever I go.

757
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,800
Don't tell me... Wendy?

758
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,000
Yeah.

759
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,000
Hi, babe.

760
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,800
Hi, doll.

761
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,700
I'm gonna go get us some candy.

762
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,000
It's not working.

763
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,200
What?!

764
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,000
So this was it. Opening night.
Our big chance.

765
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,500
Finally, one of Frank' dreams
became a reality.

766
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,000
Over here, I got some tickets!

767
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,500
Save us a seat, will ya?

768
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,300
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
this is so awesome.

769
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,000
Women hockey players.
This is what I so wanna be.

770
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,700
Penny, you don't even skate.

771
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,800
Don't be such a bitch, Glenda.

772
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,400
Hey, I'm over here
behind the fat guy.

773
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,900
- Where's our seat?
- Right over here, Michelle.

774
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,300
Great, we're in front!

775
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,800
Peanuts here.

776
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,600
Stale, overpriced peanuts.

777
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,600
Want your stale peanuts?

778
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah?

779
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,700
Wow. All right, all right, terrific.

780
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,500
We've got 2,000 seats sold already.
It's gonna be a great opening night.

781
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,600
For a new league,
this is fantastic.

782
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,500
I'm so excited, I'm gonna die.

783
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,200
Hey, who's that guy on the ice?

784
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,800
I like his suit!

785
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to an historic evening,

786
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:14,400
the debut of the World Wide
Women' Hockey League,

787
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,300
a night we will all long remember.

788
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,600
And without any further ado,
I give you the Almighty Swans!

789
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,800
We love you, Swans!

790
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:34,100
And these are
your Fearsome Foxes!

791
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,500
Come on!

792
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,500
I'm so proud of you, Frank.

793
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,900
Although I still think
you were a great lawyer,

794
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,200
I think you've finally
found your niche.

795
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,700
Keep your shirt on! Come on.

796
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,400
Let's get in the game.

797
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,400
- Get it!
- Get the puck! Get the puck!

798
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,500
Move it! Move it!

799
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,300
- That' what I'm talkin' about!
- Toss it away!

800
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,300
You got it!

801
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,700
Let' go!

802
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,900
Let's go!

803
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,500
No! Wendy!

804
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,400
Wendy, baby!
I'm coming, baby! I'm coming!

805
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,100
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
this is so incredible!

806
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,100
Glenda, they need me.

807
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:17,000
O say, can you see

808
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,900
By the dawn' early light

809
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,900
What so proudly we hailed

810
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,100
At the twilight' last gleaming?

811
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,400
Whose broad...

812
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,100
Come on, we got
a hockey game to finish here!

813
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,400
Fans, remember, while you're waiting
for the next period to begin,

814
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,900
please visit one
of our refreshment stations...

815
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,900
If that's the worst thing
that happens tonight, we'll be okay.

816
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,800
...all major credit cards
are accepted.

817
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,400
Frank Hopper?

818
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,600
Yeah.

819
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,300
Mr. Hopper,
I'm Detective Feretti, Fraud Division.

820
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,100
I have a warrant for your arrest.

821
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,200
What?

822
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,300
I'm his attorney.

823
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,500
On what charges?
He just broke that fight up.

824
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,900
Nothing to do with that,
Counselor.

825
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,700
It's grand larceny,
credit card fraud,

826
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,300
seeking and gaining credit fraudulently,
misuse of bank funds,

827
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,000
and misrepresentation
with intent to defraud.

828
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,100
What?

829
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,000
Congratulations, Mr. Hopper.
You've won top honors this month.

830
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,300
So this is how you did it.

831
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,900
Mr. Dependable.

832
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,200
Jessica, wait a minute.

833
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,100
- Thanks for bailing me...
- Not a word, Frank, not a peep.

834
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,800
Boy, you really did it this time.

835
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,700
Failure wasn't
good enough for you, was it?

836
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,800
You had to try your hand
at crime as well!

837
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,600
Do you have any idea
how many laws you broke?

838
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,600
If you charge
an exorbitant amount of money

839
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,700
knowing you don't have the means
of paying that back, it's fraud.

840
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,800
It's a crime,
or the credit card companies

841
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,800
would like to prove that as a warning
to entrepreneurs like you.

842
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,900
And they say you
falsified a credit application!

843
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,700
I didn't know... the cashier told me
it was some kind of survey.

844
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,600
She got two dollars and I got a pen.

845
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,000
Wow! You got a pen!

846
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,600
But then I got the card,

847
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,600
and I had the idea for the league,
but it was working!

848
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,600
You're gonna need
a trial lawyer now.

849
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
I'm gonna have
to think about this.

850
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,800
No, no, no.

851
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,000
No.

852
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,600
Please, Jessica.

853
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,900
He lied to me,

854
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,700
and I fell for the whole
song and dance all over again.

855
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,900
I know.

856
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,300
He's a conniver, an opportunist,
a failure, a loser,

857
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,200
a freeloader, a parasite, a bum!

858
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,300
A deceitful, lying rat.

859
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,600
So he's not perfect.

860
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,500
He ripped off the credit card companies...
how bad can he be?

861
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,700
I can't do it.

862
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,600
These bastards are playing hardball.

863
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,600
They're gonna
make Frank the poster boy

864
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,800
for 40 million credit card
delinquents.

865
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,100
There's no way I would
ask you to do this, but...

866
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,900
he's looking
at doing jail time, Jess.

867
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,600
Why can't you represent me?

868
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,000
I draw up contracts
and have drinks with people.

869
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,600
You could be going away
for a long time!

870
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,300
I'll get a public defender.

871
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,000
You're playing with the big boys.

872
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,500
You need the best lawyer you can get,
and Jessica is the best!

873
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,300
I just get a feeling
she thinks I'm a con man and a liar.

874
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,200
And what makes you think that?

875
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,900
She told me.

876
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:44,300
I know you think you've
totally blown it with Jessica.

877
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,000
I know you think that there's
nothing you could do to make it right.

878
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:52,000
All that is true, but put it behind you.
She's doing this as a favor for me.

879
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:56,300
The kids put some stuff from
their lunches for you to take to prison.

880
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,400
Thanks, Nicky.

881
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,800
Okay, you win.

882
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,300
Before we start, I wanna get
one thing straight.

883
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,900
I'm the lawyer, and you're the client
and nothing else. Got it?

884
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,000
Yeah, I got it.

885
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,800
He wants to call you
as his only witness.

886
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,300
He. Who's he?

887
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,900
Norman Brown.
He's prosecuting the case.

888
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,900
Your old boyfriend
Norman Brown?

889
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:27,900
He'll kill us.

890
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
He can't make you testify, and I'm
not gonna let him put you on the stand.

891
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,700
What'll he do if I don't testify?

892
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,800
Probably call Leona,
Carl, maybe Nick.

893
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,500
Nick's 9 years old.

894
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,700
He'll wanna prove
you have no work ethic.

895
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,500
I'll testify. I could prove
I have no work ethic.

896
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,000
I don't want you to testify.

897
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,500
I'm not putting him through this.

898
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,800
They wanna make an example of you.

899
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,900
They wanna put
your picture in the paper

900
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,800
and prove that credit card debt
is real debt, not just paper debt.

901
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,600
And then they'll settle.

902
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,900
What'll happen to the league?

903
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,500
Frank, the league is over.

904
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,800
It's kaput.

905
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,500
At least you won't do jail time.

906
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,100
We gotta hurry up.

907
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,600
Let's redeem the girls.

908
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,900
I'll testify!

909
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,600
Nearly all of us, at one time
or another, have been in debt...

910
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:30,200
but being in debt indicates a desire
and an expectancy to pay.

911
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,300
This man had no such delusions.

912
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,700
The assistant district attorney
wants you to believe that my client

913
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,600
has lived in failure...

914
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:42,400
Failure, delusion... and now crime.

915
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:46,000
He has lived in dreams
and imagination.

916
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,900
It is a criminal offense to acquire
a credit card by falsifying an application.

917
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,600
But some of the greatest advances
of mankind have come

918
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,800
from the dreams
of those who were laughed at.

919
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,400
...assume credit card debt,
knowing full well

920
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:02,000
you do not have the ability
or the intention of repaying that debt.

921
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,600
The assistant district attorney
wants you to believe...

922
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,600
He is nothing more
than a common criminal.

923
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:11,700
He is not, for if he is a criminal,
we'd better start building more jails,

924
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:17,000
because as we sit here, there are
40 million people in this country,

925
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:21,000
40 million people, who are in debt
to credit card companies.

926
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,500
I shall call only one witness
during this trial...

927
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,000
the defendant himself,
Frank Hopper,

928
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:29,500
for he is his own condemnation.

929
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,300
Thank you.

930
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,000
Mr. Hopper, where
were you employed

931
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:39,100
when you signed your application
for your first credit card?

932
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,900
I was between projects.

933
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,700
Oh, really?

934
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,200
Mr. Hopper, I have here a record

935
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,400
of your employment
for the last ten years,

936
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,200
a list of the jobs you've held
during that period.

937
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,100
Can you authenticate
it for us, please?

938
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,000
For the record, I showed
the defendant a blank sheet of paper.

939
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:05,300
Your Honor, I'd like to submit
this blank piece of paper as Exhibit "A."

940
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,900
Objections?

941
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,000
So ordered.

942
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:13,000
And is this not a complete list

943
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,600
of your financial holdings,
Mr. Hopper?

944
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,800
Naught, aught, goose-egg?

945
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,000
- I was just having a streak of bad luck.
- Yes or no.

946
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,300
Yes.

947
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,800
This streak has apparently lasted
your whole life.

948
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,800
Exhibit "B," Your Honor.

949
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,500
Mr. Hopper, on these sheets
are a list of charges

950
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,500
you've signed for
with the credit cards you received.

951
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:45,200
Would you mind reading the total
of these charges on the last page for us?

952
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:51,200
$329,000.69.

953
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,400
I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear you.

954
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:59,900
Did you say $329,000.69?
Is that correct?

955
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Yes.

956
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,600
Exhibit "C."

957
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:09,900
A list of Mr. Hopper's charges
with signed receipts.

958
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,600
And now,
with the court's permission...

959
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,900
Oh, my God!

960
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Do you believe it?

961
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,100
Order!

962
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,200
Order!

963
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,700
Your Honor...

964
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,600
Order.

965
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,100
Let's have some order in here.

966
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,900
The assistant district attorney
is playing the clown.

967
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,500
This is a mockery!

968
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:37,000
Are all these your cards,
Mr. Hopper?

969
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:41,100
Well, I'd have to check, Your Honor,
but they appear to be.

970
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:45,700
Tell me, slugger, how many
would you say there are?

971
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,300
Quite a few, Your Honor.

972
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,800
I can see that. How many?

973
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,800
I know how many I have.

974
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,100
Three.

975
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,400
I have four!

976
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,600
Two hundred and eight.

977
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,400
There you have it.

978
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:16,600
This unemployed ne'er-do-well
with no resources, no income,

979
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:20,100
no inheritance, no assets,
and no future,

980
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:24,400
had 208 credit cards,
ladies and gentlemen.

981
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,200
Exhibit "D," Your Honor.

982
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,100
And the state rests.

983
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,300
I told you he would skin you alive,
and I told you not to take the stand.

984
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,300
What do we do now?

985
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,500
- We make a deal.
- No deal!

986
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,400
I am not gonna admit
I did anything wrong,

987
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,400
I'm not paying 'em back
the rest of my life,

988
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,000
and I'm not giving up the league.

989
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,600
And you're not gonna listen
to your attorney, either.

990
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,000
Maybe you should just
represent yourself.

991
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,500
Maybe I should.

992
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:12,600
You know, Nicky, I don't want you
to think your uncle's a bad guy,

993
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,600
'cause I didn't mean to take
anything from anybody.

994
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,300
You mean steal?

995
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,000
Look, Nicky, I would never
do anything dishonest.

996
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:25,400
But Mom says you could go to jail
and end up being somebody's bitch.

997
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,900
Yeah, something like that.

998
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:32,900
All rise for the Honorable
Rutherford B. Woolsey.

999
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,300
Your Honor, at this time
I'd like the court to know

1000
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,500
that Mr. Hopper
has dismissed me as counsel

1001
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,200
and has chosen
to represent himself.

1002
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,400
Good God, he's fired his lawyer!

1003
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,500
There'll be no outbursts
in this courtroom.

1004
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:56,100
Is this true, Mr. Hopper?
Do you want to represent yourself?

1005
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,300
Yes, Your Honor.

1006
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,000
Your Honor, Mr. Hopper
practiced law some years ago

1007
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,900
and is perfectly competent to proceed.

1008
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,100
Well, I have no problem with it,
if opposing counsel doesn't mind.

1009
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,800
I most certainly welcome it,
Your Honor.

1010
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,900
I'll need a few days, Your Honor.

1011
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,600
Anything?

1012
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,900
Nothing yet.

1013
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,100
Don't be nervous.

1014
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,800
I'm not nervous.

1015
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,200
Just haven't practiced
law in a while.

1016
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,000
What was your last court case?

1017
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,200
A street vendor
had his license revoked.

1018
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,600
Maybe you should be nervous.

1019
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,900
Here it is. Perfect.

1020
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,800
Right here in the local paper.

1021
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,700
Let me see.

1022
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,400
Miss Thompson?

1023
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,700
Yes?

1024
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,000
Audrey Thompson?

1025
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,100
Yes!

1026
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,900
Miss Thompson, your sister
told me I could find you here.

1027
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,100
I'm Carl Buckinowski,
from the law firm

1028
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,400
of Hopper, Frank, Hopper,
Hopper, and Buckinowski.

1029
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,400
Could I speak with you
for a moment?

1030
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,000
I guess so.

1031
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,400
Mr. Hopper?

1032
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,500
Yes, Your Honor.

1033
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,300
I'd like to call Carl Buckinowski,

1034
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,000
assistant legal counsel,
as my first witness.

1035
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,700
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

1036
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,700
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1037
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,400
I do.

1038
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,500
You tell 'em, baby!
Give that bastard hell!

1039
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,500
Bailiff, remove that woman
from my court.

1040
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,400
Good afternoon,
Mr. Buckinowski.

1041
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,800
Could you please tell the court
how you know the defendant?

1042
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,500
Who?

1043
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,700
Me.

1044
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,200
Tell them how you know me.

1045
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,300
We're business partners,

1046
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,300
and as of Tuesday, I became
his assistant legal counsel.

1047
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,500
What is your experience
with the legal system?

1048
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,900
- I've been to traffic school eight times.
- Very good.

1049
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:23,900
Now, the district attorney here
has established very clearly

1050
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,400
that the defendant left
a good law firm to embark

1051
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,900
on a life in which he's never
made a consistent living.

1052
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,300
No savings.

1053
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,100
No income of any kind.

1054
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,300
His parents never left him
any money, did they?

1055
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,300
Did they?

1056
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,300
No.

1057
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,400
How does he live?

1058
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:47,400
He's the promoter of a women's
hockey league that played one game,

1059
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,400
but he basically
baby-sits for his nephew

1060
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,700
and his sister supplies him
with pocket money,

1061
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,300
as well as room and board.

1062
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,600
Okay, so he's down and out.

1063
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:57,500
So what happened?

1064
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,100
He applied for a credit card.

1065
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,300
Oh, but he didn't apply, did he?

1066
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,200
No.

1067
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:05,600
A girl in a store asked him to write
in his name and stuff on a form,

1068
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,600
and she would give him a free pen.

1069
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,100
- And...
- And?

1070
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,400
And they sent him the credit card.

1071
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,900
And it indicated that he was...
and I quote...

1072
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,400
"a person of impeccable credit."

1073
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,700
Yes, correct. It said so
in the letter that came with the card.

1074
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,800
But he was jobless for ten years...
a person of impeccable credit?

1075
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,400
Yeah, go figure.

1076
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,900
- He bought a gadget for his mom...
- No, no, no.

1077
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,300
Let's go on.

1078
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,100
So he got the credit card.

1079
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,800
A couple of weeks later.

1080
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,900
- He used it?
- Of course.

1081
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,500
And the next credit card?

1082
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,700
After he started
using the first card,

1083
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:41,200
he started getting more
pre-approved applications in the mail.

1084
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,800
Exactly. So now he had
a bunch of cards.

1085
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,600
Yes, and that's when he started
the women's hockey league.

1086
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,800
- He opened a bank account...
- With?

1087
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,800
Money he borrowed
on his credit card.

1088
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,900
But didn't these cards
have limits?

1089
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,100
Yes, but he was
keeping the cards current

1090
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,700
by paying the required minimums
with cash advances from other cards.

1091
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,500
But what happened
once the defendant

1092
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,600
had a business address
and a bank account?

1093
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,400
The defendant
got more credit cards,

1094
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,900
because now you were in business,
and you were flying.

1095
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,100
Right! And it would have worked,
wouldn't it?

1096
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,200
- Yes.
- And I would have paid my sister back...

1097
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,000
...all the money that I borrowed
over the years, wouldn't I?

1098
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,200
Wouldn't I?

1099
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,300
Yes, yes, yes, of course!

1100
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,400
Including the credit card bills?

1101
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,100
Especially your credit card bills.

1102
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,600
Your Honor, I'm through
with this witness.

1103
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:37,100
Ms. Lynch? Hi, I'm Elvis
from the law firm

1104
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,000
of Hopper, Hipper,
Hip-Hop, and Elvis,

1105
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,500
and I just wonder
if you've got a minute.

1106
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,600
Your Honor, I'd like to call
Warren Foote to the stand, please.

1107
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,200
He's so cute!

1108
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,600
Here we go.

1109
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,800
Place your left hand on the Bible
and raise your right.

1110
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:04,000
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

1111
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,700
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1112
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,800
Yes.

1113
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,000
- Are you comfortable, Warren?
- Yep.

1114
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,000
How old are you, buddy?

1115
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,200
Five and a quarter.

1116
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,600
Five and a quarter?
You're a big boy.

1117
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:17,100
Do you go to school?

1118
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,100
Yep, I go to the Canyon School.

1119
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,800
Okay. So what grade are you in?

1120
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,600
I'm in kindergarten.

1121
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,000
My teacher is named Mrs. Lynch,

1122
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:30,000
and we have two hamsters
that are named Cuddles and Lovey.

1123
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,700
I bet your teacher's really cool.

1124
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,000
Hey, Warren,
let me ask you a question.

1125
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:39,300
Do you go to school every day,
except for Saturday and Sundays?

1126
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,300
Yep.

1127
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,600
- And what do you do after school?
- I play!

1128
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,400
You play.

1129
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,300
You don't have to go to work
or have a job, do you?

1130
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,800
My God, Your Honor,
what is going on here?

1131
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,800
This is a travesty.

1132
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:56,900
As I recall, Mr. Brown, you started
this show business approach.

1133
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Continue, Mr. Hopper.

1134
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,400
Warren, what's this?

1135
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,000
My credit card!

1136
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,200
Did Mommy and Daddy
give this to you?

1137
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:12,200
No.

1138
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:15,100
Mommy said the people
at the credit card company

1139
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,700
just sent it to me.

1140
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,400
Oh, you're pre-approved?

1141
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:22,200
Now, you've had no job,
never made a living,

1142
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,800
never really worked at anything at all
and you have no earnings,

1143
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:29,800
no savings, no income
of any kind, right?

1144
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,200
But Cuddles has a weenie!

1145
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,800
Well, thank you, Warren.

1146
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,900
Your Honor, Exhibit "A."

1147
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,500
Cross, Mr. Brown.

1148
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,400
So, Warren.

1149
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,400
It is Warren, isn't it?

1150
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,600
I have no further questions
for this witness, Your Honor.

1151
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,700
Your Honor, the defense would like
to call Tommy T. Thompson to the stand.

1152
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,400
My God, Your Honor!

1153
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,100
He has crossed the line!

1154
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:29,900
If you think I'm gonna stop
this now, you're crazy.

1155
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,100
Which one is your witness?

1156
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,700
The dog.

1157
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,800
I was hoping
you were gonna say that.

1158
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:36,900
So.

1159
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:43,400
Tommy, is this your credit card?

1160
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,500
Yes. Yes, it is.

1161
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:54,100
It came in the mail
from the bank, unsolicited.

1162
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,000
I called them up, and I said,

1163
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:02,500
"Do you realize that
Tommy T. Thompson is a dog?"

1164
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,600
And they hung up on me.

1165
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:10,300
Could you please tell the court,
has Tommy ever held a job,

1166
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,300
ever had to make a consistent living,
ever really had...?

1167
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:16,200
I most strenuously object,
Your Honor!

1168
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,200
On what basis?

1169
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,200
That the witness is mentally
incapable of testifying.

1170
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:25,500
The bank should have thought of that
before they issued him a credit card.

1171
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,200
Your Honor,
Exhibit "B" for the defense.

1172
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,900
Your witness, Counselor.

1173
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,000
Hello, Mrs. Thompson.

1174
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:39,300
Hello.

1175
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,800
He's very cute.

1176
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,200
Oh, darling.

1177
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,900
I am through with this witness,
Your Honor.

1178
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:59,100
Your Honor, my next witness is a...

1179
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:03,800
Your Honor, before Mr. Hopper
drags in an elephant

1180
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:06,700
with six Visa cards
and an AMEX platinum,

1181
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,600
we concede
that the credit card companies

1182
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,900
do occasionally make mistakes.

1183
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Your Honor, these are not mistakes.

1184
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:15,900
They're a clear pattern of greed,

1185
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,200
giving cards to people
who shouldn't have them.

1186
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,700
Save it for your summation,
Mr. Hopper.

1187
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,500
But, Your Honor, I have
a monk sworn to poverty,

1188
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,400
a retired embezzler on welfare,
a penguin who...

1189
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,300
That's enough.
That's more than enough for today.

1190
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,900
Let me get this straight...
the monk, the donkey,

1191
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,400
the friggin' camel, all the animals,
and the aborigine...

1192
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,700
They all had credit cards?

1193
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,400
Every single one of 'em.

1194
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,500
Even the dummy?

1195
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,000
Even the dummy.

1196
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:00,800
I just came to tell you
you were terrific today.

1197
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,000
You were right.

1198
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,800
- You were there?
- I was hidden.

1199
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,700
I told you, Frank,
you're a great lawyer.

1200
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,300
I was trying to defend you
by the book, and...

1201
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,400
I almost blew it.

1202
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,600
As usual, you used your imagination,
and it came through for you.

1203
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,400
Go in there tomorrow
and tear 'em up!

1204
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:23,200
And so in summation,
ladies and gentlemen,

1205
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:26,800
you have to decide
whether this man,

1206
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:31,400
who by his own admission
in this very courtroom

1207
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,900
never sought regular employment,

1208
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,400
accepted and used
these credit cards,

1209
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:42,600
and spent $329,000.

1210
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,900
I have explained to you

1211
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,200
that buying merchandise

1212
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,100
or borrowing cash

1213
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,300
or buying services

1214
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:56,300
or using credit cards
to finance a women's hockey league

1215
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,400
without the intent to pay is a crime.

1216
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:06,000
If that's the case,
and it is, this man is guilty!

1217
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,800
Thank you for your time.

1218
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,200
Proceed, Mr. Hopper.

1219
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,800
You have to decide
these two questions.

1220
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:24,700
One, did the defendant,
Frank Hopper, me...

1221
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,800
believe that he
could repay his debts?

1222
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,400
And two,

1223
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,300
was he induced...

1224
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,500
literally hypnotized
into using these cards,

1225
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,500
which, at first, he did not ask for?

1226
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:42,800
My answer to the first question
is of course I was gonna pay my bills.

1227
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,100
I dreamt of this
women's hockey league.

1228
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,600
I dreamt it would
be hugely successful,

1229
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:52,100
televised across the nation
and covered on every sports page.

1230
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,100
And it almost happened.

1231
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,700
Now, sure,
some of my ideas were lousy.

1232
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,800
But as Americans,

1233
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:06,100
we all have the right
to a lousy idea now and then, don't we?

1234
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,900
I'm not here to condemn the banks

1235
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,800
or their policies when it
comes to credit cards.

1236
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,600
They've done that to themselves.

1237
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:20,000
I'm just trying to explain how people,
good people, can lose themselves...

1238
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:26,300
when somebody says
here... here's a genie's lamp.

1239
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,300
Rub it...

1240
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,800
and all your dreams can come true.

1241
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,700
I don't appreciate
the rough treatment, man.

1242
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,200
I paid $40 for this suit.

1243
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,500
This guy says he's part
of your legal team.

1244
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:48,700
I got a law degree.

1245
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:53,100
Yeah, Hopper, Hipper,
Buckinowski and Elvis.

1246
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,500
That's Elvis.

1247
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:58,700
Oh, the jury's back.

1248
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,200
Hold on, hold on,
the courtroom's full.

1249
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,400
I only have room
for a couple more.

1250
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,600
I'm not going back in there.
I'm too nervous.

1251
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:06,600
Well, I'm going.

1252
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,300
I don't know what they're
doing around here... lawsuit...

1253
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:14,900
I don't know what they're
doing around here... lawsuit...

1254
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,400
What? Oh.

1255
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:19,000
Hey, baby. How's my man?

1256
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,100
Your man?

1257
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,400
Elvis and I, we've been seeing
a lot of each other.

1258
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,600
You slut! He's mine!

1259
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:25,600
Not a great time for this.

1260
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:27,300
You too?

1261
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,500
Well... okay...

1262
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,000
you know what?

1263
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,500
All three?

1264
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,800
You dirty dog.

1265
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,500
Girls!

1266
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,600
Ladies!

1267
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,700
Hey, he's not guilty!

1268
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,700
He's not guilty!

1269
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,900
Oh, my God!

1270
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,100
Hey, here's Frank!

1271
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:06,700
We did it!

1272
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,300
Who are you?

1273
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,500
He's a friend!

1274
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,600
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you for everything.

1275
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,800
You've been like family to me.

1276
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:24,600
But I've got a lot of credit card bills
I've gotta pay off, so...

1277
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:26,900
the league's gonna be
on hold for awhile.

1278
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,200
That's all right.

1279
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,500
Not necessarily.

1280
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,000
What?

1281
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,300
I... I got something for you.

1282
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,400
It's a...

1283
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,300
It's a...

1284
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,500
Wednesday.

1285
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,300
Tuesday's.

1286
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,600
The shoe, sometimes.

1287
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,300
This check
should cover the cards,

1288
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:00,400
and then I can waive
the first year's rent on the rink.

1289
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,600
Elvis, aren't you, like,
a homeless guy or something?

1290
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:11,400
Oh, no, I actually own the rink,
and the bank across the street, too,

1291
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:14,600
but I can't sleep at the bank
because of the security people.

1292
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:18,800
So, I'd appreciate if you guys would
clear out of there by 10:00 every night.

1293
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:19,800
Yeah, great.

1294
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,900
That's not a problem.

1295
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Elvis, thank you!

1296
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,100
Thank you!

1297
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,600
- Actually, l...
- Thank you!

1298
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:30,400
I didn't do it for you so much
as I did it for the ladies.

1299
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,000
Oh, thank you, babe.

1300
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,800
He means me.

1301
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,300
Oh, yeah, right!

1302
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,500
You're just jealous!

1303
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,500
Bitch!

1304
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,900
The trouble with my friend Frank is...
he ain't got no trouble.

1305
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,700
Got a hair out of place there, Jon.

1306
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,200
Oh, good, a little hair.

1307
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,800
Jon Bon Jovi, ladies and gentlemen!

1308
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,800
He wanted to be an actor!
