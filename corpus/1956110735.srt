3
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,660
You play in a band?

4
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,420
I'm kind of a guitar player for hire

5
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,890
Oh, what band were you playing with?

6
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,370
I played with Albert King, Skinner,

7
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,250
No, No

8
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,860
Muddy Waters, B B King.

9
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,530
hey, hey, hey, you put down! /You play this thing?

10
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,380

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,690

00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,740
Put my guitar back/Shut up Lonna

13
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,080
Why don't you put my guitar down/ Want your guitar?

14
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,140
Yeah ...here it is!

15
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,450
Jesus.. guys

16
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,810
Did you get that approved?

17
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,500
Oh, come on. You have diet house bands out the Wazoo.

18
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,280
Don't call it diet house. Everybody calls it that.

19
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,620
Well is derogatory. It's a nutrition center.

20
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,900
Now listen Ed, we got to huddle about this band.

21
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,900
I'm getting complaints and plenty of them.

22
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,960
Nobody likes to see a bunch of convicts... skulking around the campus.

23
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Beside that the band sounds terrible.

24
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,810
You're the most annoying brother alive.

25
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,810
All we need is a little practice.

26
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,810
Oh no!

27
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,220
And look, here's my new guitar player.

28
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,660
You guys got a tub here?

29
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,660
Nothing like a good long soak. You know what I'm saying?

30
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,310
Wesley Benfield. You have been arrested 13 times.

31
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,310
Only five convictions.

32
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,610
I got blamed for a lot of shit did not do.

33
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,840
Watch your mouth.

34
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,990
This is a house of the Lord. I will not tolerate foul language.

35
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,990
That is rule number one.

36
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,830
Sorry,The Lord is my shepherd.

37
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,590
Are you being sarcastic? Because if you are the deputy will march you right back to jail.

38
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,100
No, I'm not. I'm sorry. I've been to Sunday school. I read the Bible a lot.

39
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,250
Yeah, take a look at my file there sir. It'll tell you where I was raised up

40
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,250
At the orphanage down in Bonneville.

41
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,250
They made us read the bible

42
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,200
I've written out whole sections out by hand...

43
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,630
In detention.

44
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,050
I bet that was quite often.

45
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,580
That was the old me.

46
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,860
Look sir, if you could just find a mustard seed of forgiveness,

47
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,510
I promise you won't regret it.

48
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,560
OK, Rhodell. He's a keeper.

49
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,140
Listen, you screw this up.

50
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,140
I'm going to come up here,

51
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,550
Take off my jewelry and whip your little white ass.

52
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,550
Oh, language Rhodell.

53
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,180
That's why I started a band. Healing criminal minds through music is my main focus.

54
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,170
This is the girls wing. The boys are down here.

55
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,910
We have an honor system, but I will be checking.

56
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,240
What kind of music y'all play.

57
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,960
Hymns, Hello Raymond.

58
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,290
Hymms?

59
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,290
Yes Hymms, I thought you went to church.

60
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,590
Oh my Ben, you're supposed to be down painting the porch.

61
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,450
Man.. I don't feel good. Well, clean off that bed. You've got a new roommate?

62
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,850
Come on, get busy.

63
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,220
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, look now. Okay.

64
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,980
This, this, this cat right here, He just got out of jail right

65
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,950
Okay. now this is no good.

66
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,560
Okay, hold on man. Hey, what are you putting us on the floor?

67
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,450
Why? Cause Mr. Ned told me to

68
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,800
Listen, man. This is no good. Okay. How am me and Lonnie supposed to get clean?

69
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,360
How am me and Lonnie supposed to get all back on track again

70
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,200
If you keep bringing troublemakers up in here,

71
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,390
Alright? Taken him down the hall, let Raymond deal with him.

72
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,970
You Know Raymond lives in a closet....is gonna mess me up

73
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,220
Man I'm already messed up.

74
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,370
I decide who goes where, not you.

75
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,770
And remember a soft answer turns away wrath,

76
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,770
But a harsh word stirs up anger.

77
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,940
That's proverbs

78
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,680
Yes,... it is.

79
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Make yourself comfortable.

80
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,110
You some kind of Jesus Freak.

81
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,140
You know, Jesus comes out a lot different when you read the Bible straight through

82
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,340
He caused some trouble,

83
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,340
He stirred up some things.

84
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,600
Okay, thank you.

85
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,070
Let's go Lonnie./ Alright.

86
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,240
You did that last week, man. A smart man...You did that last week.

87
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,570
This was mama's favorite.

88
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,920
You may have to share.

89
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,050
Hello Raymond, ladies.

90
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,370
Raymond why don't you try the bongos today?

91
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:36,050
Oh, Wesley welcome,  oh you've met Ben and Lonnie.

92
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,000
This is Raymond, Shanita and Angie.

93
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,620
And where's your guitar? I'll just play that one.

94
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,110
Would you be more comfortable with your guitar?.... You know what?

95
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,400
It's old and beat up. I just rather play that one.

96
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,140
But we're not fancy here.

97
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,800
That one's fine, Mr. S. /Very well. Okay, kids follow me.

98
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Blessed Assurance

99
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,370
Sing out Raymond.

100
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,880
Not too fast, slow down.

101
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,740
I can't hear you singing Lonnie

102
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,880
Get up, get up, Wesley wake up

103
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,250
Get up and put on this tee shirt.

104
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,160
What on earth is wrong with Ben?/What on earth is wrong with you Mr.

105
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,620
Get dressed/ Mr. Seers/ and get downstairs. We are waiting.

106
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,110
His Majesty is coming down now.

107
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,800
And you going to leave the door. you going to close the door?

108
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,340
No, he going to break the door.

109
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,230
Can you have some respect for the van please?

110
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,420
it's not your van

111
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,530
I know it's not my van, slamming like it's dominoes, man.

112
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,650
But Mr. Seer put me in charge of it,/ ooh watch out

113
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:41,140
Hey girl....Shake that ass, Shake that ass ,

114
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,540
Hey, hey... you all stop it!

115
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,140
Clean the eggs up, man

116
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,800
What, what, what,

117
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:32,480
Shanita who going to clean this up... /ah ah, that's not my problem, that's not my problem.

118
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,200
Here he comes the little sorry ass, look, look at him, look at him.

119
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,640
Asshole egg slopping fool

120
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,710
Oh y'all going to be like that, fine!

121
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,340
Watch it, hey.

122
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,970
Need to watch where you're going, bro.

123
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,570
Hey. I'm talking to you. You need to slow down, man. you are going to run somebody over.

124
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,170
It'll do about a hundred.

125
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,570
What is it a rocket ship.../its a Plymouth.

126
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,600
Oh yeah, sure. Yeah, it's a Plymouth. What year is it, buddy? Maybe it's worth the money.

127
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,340
It's 1963,

128
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,570
4 door hardtop. 318 cubic inch  twin valves, and Torqueflite transmission.

129
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,800
What color is it?

130
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
What do you think?

131
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,220
I have no idea. There's nothing there.

132
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,970
Desert Beige Caramel,

133
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:04,650
er, er, er, er, er, er, er.

134
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,110
Hey buddy you miss a spot

135
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,280
No buddy right here

136
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:19,250
er, er, er, er, er, er, er.

137
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,250
Is a clean windshield.

138
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,140
Where is he? He got a new owl.

139
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:14,000
Careful. Careful gingerly now. Very good.  That's nice. Careful. Now

140
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:20,510
Since we put it in that box, I think a whole...the fish always stinks from the head,

141
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,710
Hey ain't she a beauty Ned... we're supposed to be playing a Spring Fling.

142
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,710
Boys give me Just a moment. Keep your voice down.

143
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,800
Keep your voice down. I signed us up over a month ago. We were playing.

144
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,340
Spring fling is from Ballard student body. Not those convicts. They're not enrolled.

145
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,200
Don't say convicts. It's derogatory. They're at risk youth.

146
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,420
Oh, too bad. They're not fat, Maybe then you care.

147
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,570
Do you have any idea how much money that nutrition center brings into this college?

148
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,140
I'm glad mom is not alive to see this.

149
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:03,050
How is it every time I bring up, excuse me. How is it every time I bring up something, it don't matter,

150
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,970
Hey, hold on we all eat together.

151
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,020
Where is Wesley Benfield?

152
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,280
Ben, you are the designated driver.

153
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Um, I don't know.

154
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Mr. Seer, he just disappeared

155
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,940
And you just left. Why wasn't I notified?

156
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,740
But I thought I could count on you. I am disappointed.

157
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,740
I am extremely disappointed.

158
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,940
Hey, Mr Sears. It's, it wasn't his fault. I was walking.

159
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,420
That is against the rules.

160
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,420
I have to know where you are at all times.

161
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,080
Every second of the day. Is that clear?

162
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,480
Yes sir. It had better be.

163
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,140
May I remind you all that you are in a halfway house,

164
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,940
Which means you are halfway in jail already

165
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,370
And you will be all the way in unless you straighten up.

166
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,880
I just got word today. They might pull our funding

167
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,200
Jail? Yes, from whence you cometh.

168
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,820
Raymond, let me have that.

169
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,340
Now, people, let's get serious. We have five days until spring fling

170
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,340
This our chance to show the whole school...Wait a minute, Wait a minute, the whole school?

171
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,020
Yes. Everyone will be there.

172
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,600
So let's get busy. Let's practice, Let's get better...

173
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,420
And lets us pray.

174
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,820
Tell me how we're supposed to get up in front of the whole damn school

175
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,880
And play this butt Numbing crap...Do you think we like it

176
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,250
But don't come over here s starting all this trouble. You heard what the man said? We could go back to jail.

177
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,940
What did you guys go to jail for anyway?

178
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,940
That's none of your business.

179
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,800
Well, I got in a fight with my boyfriend

180
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,400
So.

181
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,140
So I shot him.

182
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,650
In the leg, He's fine. You know he's not dead.

183
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,600
They said that it was attempted manslaughter.

184
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,650
But I say asshole slaughter is more like it.

185
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,880
So I guess you better just played a guitar and shut up.

186
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,940
Wesley, That is not funny.

187
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,140
Yeah, I know. It's not funny...you got to walking around here like a bunch of organ grinder Monkeys,

188
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,140
Ooh, who you calling monkeys?

189
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,140
Hey Man I called us all, monkeys

190
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,370
Pipe down Wesley. Nobody flies solo here. We're a team.

191
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,370
I can't do it.

192
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,140
I'll do anything else. Give me another job. I'll paint the whole house.

193
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,650
Oh No. If you're not in the band, you're not in the house.

194
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,050
Sorry, Kid shows the over. Wrap up equipment. I'll be in the van.

195
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,050
Mr S . Wait a minute, , Can we talk about this?

196
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,910

You ran away. I did not run away. You all left me.

224
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,570
You're lying. I saw you with my own eyes.

225
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,480
I did.. I'm not... here I am, ready to go, Spring fling. Look at me. I'm right here.

226
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,600
Too. Late Wesley. Woe to them who strays from me.

227
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,400
Oh, I did not stray. I met this kid. He a genius piano player. He probably like an angel.

228
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,880
He a genius piano player. He probably like an angel.

232
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,280
Nothing. Everything is fine. We're getting ready to head over to spring fling.

233
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,010
Well, I've got a new client over there, a high roller from Kansas City

234
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,080
All of a sudden I got these lights flashing and deputies running around. You know what that looks like.

235
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,650
This is not working out.

236
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:10,800
We had the first group to perform. What do you think of a noble defenders of the word?

237
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,540
I think it was the last nail in your coffin.

238
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,770
Thanks. Lot.

239
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Hello? Hey Man. whats Going on. Hey, can I come inside?

00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,200
But you think maybe you can come down there with me and play that song you just played.

242
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
Just one time.

243
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,240
Come on man, you gotta come down here and if you don't come down there, with me

244
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
Them People down there, They don't put me back in jail.

245
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:36,080
I gotta go ask my dad. He's at the  shop,

246
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,530
No you don't. We just go right now. Nobody didn't have to know.

247
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,480
Well, he's the boss of me. That's okay. Just come do this with me please.

251
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,680

252
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:58,800
Well, that cool, i can cook something, , some. It don't matter, what you guys like.

253

00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,310

00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,060
Oh no man, Mr. S. No... thought we discuss this

256
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,850
We discuss, oh man...  this is chance for you to really stand out

257
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,460
Those are old fashion, i don't want to stand out

258
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,640
Noooo...we'll discuss this later

259
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,500
Anyway is what I say, what do you say?

260
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,140
Raymond can not be on guitar.

261
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,080
Too many people

262
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:46,360
Hey...What are you doing Vernon?

263
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,760
Since when do board members go to spring fling?   Is a special occasion Ned.

264
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,740
The board might want to see the band in action.

265
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,500
No, it's perfectly fine. If you're walking backwards, see, then nobody out here can see

266
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,560
Don t leave me by myself, I promise I wont leave you by yourself.

267
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,340
Promise... Vernon, Jesus Christ. I promise. I won't leave you by yourself. All right,

268
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,900
They got a piano? Yeah. All you gotta do is get up and play.

269
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,900
I bet it ain't tuned

270
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,940
Watch your step to step up with your foot. Don't turn. Don't turn around.

271
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,920
See

272
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,140
Tell me when you're ready

273
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:48,440
We like to give everyone a chance, but some people are just not Ballard material

274
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,500
Guys, come on,  yo guys get up here!

275
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,500
Wesley, who is that? This my friend Vernon, he is going to play with us.

276
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,420
Come on, lets go... what's going on?

277
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,740
Vernon, where you going, where you going, what do you doing?... the bushes, I got to pee,... well finish the song first.

278
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,280
I have to pee bad, What do you want me to do, Vernon, look is full

279
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,400
Guys? Excuse me from a buddy here. You really have to go to the bathroom.

280
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:31,540
Ah Vernon, what the hell, I told you had to go, you weren't kidding

281
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,120
But is OK, its happened to everybody in some time

282
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,320
I don't think so, we are not special.

283
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,920
Yes you are. You are a special kind of asshole.

284
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,100
What you call me, you heard What I said? Aren't you in enough trouble?

285
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,760
What's going on? The board of trustees out there loving this music.

286
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,060
See, I told you he could play... my pants are wet.

287
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,520
OK boys get out of here. Go on. That's enough.

288
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,540
I'll see you later... I'll be waiting.

289
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,520
He's got to get back up there. We're here at Vernon. Take my pants.

290
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,760
You have to come... No, no, no. You're killing them up there.

291
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,660
You do not need me...Yes I do, You promised.

292
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,900
Oh Lord. Take my pants,

293
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,800
Hurry on boys, get a move on.

294
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,660
Here Vernon,  take these pants, go in there and put them on please.

295
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,660
We have to sign this young man, I see you around town

296
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,760
Driving... a Plymouth...4 door, hard top, 318 cubic inch

297
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,420
Wonderful. Wonderful. I think the band should be all young people.

298
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,620
My god Wesley, I've got to hand it to you. Seek and Ye shall find.

299
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,820
Let's see. You had to go to jail. No Sir. Not Today.

300
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,660
Great job Ned...Ned the band they were terrific. Thank you. Luther

301
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:12,520
Thanks,...What about using it for founders day? Well, let's not get carried away here.

302
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,040
That's an excellent idea. Luther, the kids that come such a long way.

303
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,820
You know, they had a whole new dimension to Ballard. Might even attract new money.

304
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:26,520
Listen yo. I'm only gonna say this once, You save us man.

305
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,620
Yeah, you did. I appreciate it., No problem. But it wasn't me. It was him.

306
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,680
What is up man. Thanks...I'm Ben.

307
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,200
Alright, you going to be in band... OK

308
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,160
Hello. Hi. I'm the executive director of the Back On Track Again house.

309
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,300
Oh Great. Do you mind if I ask you some questions? I'm doing a story for the Democrat leader.

310
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,320
Absolutely. We need to drum up some support. Our funding is about to be cut.

311
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,980
That band is the most exciting thing to happen to Ballard in a long time.

312
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,360
You'll have to ask Deermont. He's the big cheese around here.

313
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,760
Who? Ellen, I'm sure we can work something out.

314
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,000
I'll leave you two alone. Ned why don't you Put some pants on

315
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,420
I'm getting accustomed to these.

316
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:12,100
Anyway, I started this program called Christian criminal rehabilitation

317
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,640
Are the criminals, all Christian.

318
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,640
Oh yes. They just don't know it yet

319
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,300
And you have to understand the band is not just a band.

320
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:27,100
I am perfecting the use of Christian music to infiltrate and heal the criminal mind.

321
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,900
It just pauses it just blowing my focus. Oh, okay.

322
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,300
Hey Vernon, please. You have to stop that rocking

323
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,550
You gotta get your hands on. you just need you to be still for a minute.

324
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:45,700
Hey, wait wait, wait...hey Vernon, Vernon

329
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,400
Slashed. I just calm down, I'm not about this man.

330
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:51,500
What are y'all doing with him? You need to tell me or you can tell the sheriff

331
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,550
Nothing, sir. We were just. He was down at the school helping us have plants in music. That's all

332
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,550
How that happened

333
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,750
You're on special ed. No. No. Wait.

334
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:05,650
We're in a band. Yeah, kind of a Christian man. \I hate that crap.

335
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,600
Go on get outta here.

336
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:16,800
Actually sir, we was kind of hoping that maybe Vernon could come play music with us.

337
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,600
There's about a dog's chance in hell of that happening.

338
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,750
Vernon's music is for Vernon. He don't play with nobody.

339
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,450
He played with us and he's got a gift. He ought to be out in the world.

340
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:30,000
You trying to tell me how to raise my son. No Sir.

341
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,700
Well you best not, and where the hell are his bridges.

342
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,700
He peed them

343
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:43,800
You know? I think you two done enough for Vernon.

344
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:50,000
You church boys. Just get back in truck., Go back where you come from...now

345
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,000
Yes sir

346
00:36:54,650 --> 00:37:02,700
Where's my Plymouth? It's right over there. Vernon. We towed it.

347
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:05,450
Is Vernon. Okay? Yeah, he's okay. What did his parents say.

348
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,850
Hmm... I only met his dad, and...

349
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:13,900
And?... and we can't talk about is rocking anymore because that's why I got upset.

350
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,650
Okay, fine. We can handle that.

351
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:23,450
I've been thinking what a tremendous asset he is going to be. You were so right. He's already made such a great change.

352
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:29,700
Uh, you know what? I'm gonna head upstairs because I don't feel too good. Well, take care of yourself.

353
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,700
Good Work Benjamin. Thank you. Mr. S.

354
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,100
I am going to have to speak with his father and get his permission.

355
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,950
No, that's probably not good idea, Mr. let me take care of that. Okay, fine. You were handling.

356
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:42,450
Wesley I told the sheriff I'm giving you another chance. I don't want any problems.

357
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:48,550
You got that? Yes sir. Especially since Verdun is not a resident of BOTA house,

358
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:56,200
Although he is definitely disadvantaged, in which case he'll fit right in. Do you know what I mean?

359
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,100
Yeah. He'll fit right in.

360
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:05,950
Wesley, I'm glad to see you getting back on track. I know we had our little misunderstandings, but you really came through for the band

361
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:42,800
Guide me in my efforts to help the noble defenders of the word. Glorify your name. Amen.

362
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,900
Raymond your Turn to help to Flip.

363
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm Serious, I think we can do with this kid. With Vernon?

364
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,850
Look men you know you don't even know this kid already. Did you see what he did.

365
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,850
Ben? Seriously how you guys can in your life out selling coke

366
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:01,670
So now you see that, that is some to serious racial profiling, yes it is.

367
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,460
For your information. We were real musicians, we was raised in the church.

368
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,420
Long before we wrote them. Bad checks.

369
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,440
If you guys are real musicians and you should be primed to play the blues.

370
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,760
Wesley, The Blues is Wax Museum. It's not wax museum.

371
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:22,350
Vernon, look at the Muscles on that, that too much. that just sick.

372
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,770
Why the numbers on the clock and the circle.

373
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,360
I don't know

374
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,360
Oh,  She is new

375
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,350
Seemed like they always go in  circle.

376
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,350
Each one by itself

377
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,510
They never line up together or nothing....

378
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:40,260
That's what think kid...sundial

379
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,800

381
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,610

I' thought I've told you to get.

422
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:32,720
I just. I came down here because I promised Vernon I would come cook something for him.

423
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,390
Is that right? Vernon. You asked him to come cook?

424
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,220
Pork chops.

425
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,340
You got some nerve. I'm cooking something for you too.

426
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,840
I ain't going to be ready for about a half hour

427
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,550
Then you call me, when is done.

428
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,720
I didn't slice it.

429
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,330
Hey, better be some tasty pork chops.

430
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,980
Don't let Vernon around no electricity.

431
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,980
No Sir.

432
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:32,590
I blow up some things.

433
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:42,230
So Vernon, I was kind of hoping maybe later you can come by and maybe we can do some planning, you know,

434
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,180
With your permission. Of course. I play guitar.

435
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,700
Whereabouts do you live exactly,

436
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,300
Down over on ninth street.

437
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,480
Over by the Christian college.

438
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:56,730
You live in that halfway house? Yup. Near

439
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:57,990
Yeah

440
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:01,280
I do Sir.

441
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,880
It's really more like a dorm.

442
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,300
I mean, I don't really take anybody down there unless they're okay.

443
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:11,740
I mean most people on their bachelors or women and people who don't pose no threat.

444
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,450
How do I know you don't pose no threat.

445
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,010
He just wander into a guy's house.

446
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,010
What you do?

447
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:21,890
Can I have some ice cream? No, not right now.

448
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:23,890
I want to know what he did.

449
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:28,150
Mainly cars, but that was then. I mean, sure...

450
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:34,120
Look at that burden we got as a guitar picking bandit Car thief right here.

451
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,470
Guitar man, a killer dealers,...no no, your Keller dealer.

452
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,280
That's a good thing, right?

453
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,400
It is to him. It don't mean crap to me.

454
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,480
See, I don't want you and your kind around my son.

455
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,370
So I think you better just get on back to your house now.

456
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,500
Go on, now.

457
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,460
At least get halfway to your house.

458
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,880
Take it easy.

459
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:09,270
By the way, you do make a good port job. Thanks. You do

460
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,980
Vernon. He ain't no account.

461
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:22,050
He's my friend.

462
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:25,810
Yeah, you need a higher class of friends.

463
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:34,860
Goodnight Vernon,... Nite

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,550

00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,160
Vernon

469
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:03,170
We don't know Mars Code.

470
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:05,170
It's a message.

471
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:06,680
What is it?

472
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,680
I want to play that music.

473
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,370
If you'll stand next to me

474
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,950
I'll stand next to you. I'll be there the whole time.

483
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:06,130
Well, I guess that would do. And just in time they want your kids to play on the radio. Great PR.

484
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:10,010

Well son, I'm not anybody's boss, but I am the head of boathouse if that's what you mean

491
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:38,900

Who you looking for?

620
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,440
Vernon, where is he?

621
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:33,190
You must be as father welcomed

622
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:38,570
I was about to put one foot in the door, doubled up your act, and I've watched burden.

623
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:46,050
Mr Moker, I had heard that you give people about a 150, 200 bucks when it's packed like this

624
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:50,520
And you know since we brought everyone in, posters were hung up all over town.

625
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:56,010
Mr. Moker, I was wondering if you might give us a cut.

626
01:08:56,010 --> 01:09:01,330
Mr. Moker... I was wondering... if you might give us a cut of the door,

627
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:05,940
Who the hell are you?    the roadie.

628
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:15,200

01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:21,930
You went to jail defending your guitar

631
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:26,090
And it's a good thing. you look good enough to eat up on that stage.

632
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,820
What are y'all doing?

633
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:43,100
Vernon? Vernon, come on gimme a minute.

634
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,810
Why can I stay here?  Because I'm getting a little.

635
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:50,400
Would you just go on inside for a minute please? Come on.

What's the matter? You cant stop that rocking.

639
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:28,570
Well Ned. This is a fine mess.

640
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,310
Just in time for founders day,

641
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:35,330
You're going to go on stage, you're going to play one song and that's it. It's over.

642
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:39,940
Come on boys, lets get a move on, i got a date with ????

643
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:43,510
Hey johnny,  going to be a man and sign . For eight  this time.

644
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:46,600
Well going for 4 weeks this time.

645
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,800
Whats your name sport?

646
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:57,610
You going to answer me or what?

647
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:07,400
Well you're going or not going. Oh,

648
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,400
Jackass

649
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:31,540
Hi, Mr. Jackson, I'm  	Dr. Gwen Bradley

650
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:33,570
What have you done to Vernon .

651
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:35,570
He don't even recognize me.

652
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,510
His medication is still wearing off. He arrived in a highly agitated state. No one could control him

653
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:43,510
I can control him.

654
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:45,510
He can't be around people.

655
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:49,370
We tried calling you. The deputy even went out to your house.

656
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:53,280
Well, I was out looking for Vernon.

657
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,080
All night?... Yeah.

658
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,610
Well, I had to pull over and sleep some.

659
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,450
Has Vernon been tested,the BSC or the aberrant behavior checklist.

660
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:07,050
Maybe in school.

661
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:10,880
Mr. Jackson. I would like to test Vernon.

662
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,880
I suspect that he has a high functioning degree of autism.

663
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:21,020
Vernon needs to learn how to interact. He needs to learn how to read social cues.

664
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:24,140
Takes time and patience, but it can be done.

665
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:30,940
And Mr. Jackson, I think that keeping him at home is not the answer.
