1051
01:13:48,904 --> 01:13:50,239
I thought...

1052
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:56,578
I thought, "Fuck, I'm late.

1053
01:14:00,216 --> 01:14:02,084
"I'm too fucking late."

1055

See you, guys.

PETER:
What are you doing here?

1057
01:16:33,936 --> 01:16:35,070
Carlos!

1058
01:16:35,104 --> 01:16:36,972
Michael, what are
you doing here?

1059
01:16:37,006 --> 01:16:38,274
Carlos.

1060
01:16:41,076 --> 01:16:42,411
Carlos.

1061
01:16:43,512 --> 01:16:44,947
No sparring today.

1062
01:16:45,881 --> 01:16:48,884
I brought this guy over here.
Get ready.

1063
01:16:48,918 --> 01:16:51,020
He actually used
to be a real fighter.

1064
01:16:51,053 --> 01:16:54,256
And I want to see him
move around with your kid.

1065
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:56,258
This ain't the place
for somebody like that.

1066
01:16:56,292 --> 01:16:58,194
MICHAEL:
Listen to me, Carlos.

1067
01:16:58,227 --> 01:16:59,895
I saw your kid move around
the other day,

1068
01:16:59,929 --> 01:17:01,063
and I thought it
was really impressive.

1069
01:17:01,096 --> 01:17:03,199
Now I want to see him move
around with a real fighter.

1070
01:17:03,232 --> 01:17:04,500
That's why I brought
this guy in here.

1071
01:17:04,533 --> 01:17:06,670
- Michael, stop it.
- Am I talking to you?

1072
01:17:09,071 --> 01:17:10,239
I didn't think so.

1073
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:13,209
This is my gym.

1074
01:17:13,242 --> 01:17:14,944
I know it's your fucking gym.

1075
01:17:14,977 --> 01:17:16,245
And that's why I brought
a fighter in here

1076
01:17:16,278 --> 01:17:18,047
so he can move around
with your kid.

1077
01:17:19,215 --> 01:17:21,217
Carlos look at me.
Look at me!

1078
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:26,055
I'm asking you for
a favor here. You understand?

1079
01:17:26,088 --> 01:17:28,290
And I think you want
to fucking give me that favor,

1080
01:17:28,324 --> 01:17:29,858
- do you understand?
- [LENNY] You fuck!

1081

PETER: Carlos, come on!
Stop it! Stop it!

1082
01:17:32,094 --> 01:17:33,128
Stop it!

1083
01:17:33,462 --> 01:17:34,496
Stop it!

1084
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:36,398
- Hey, Lenny... Lenny.
- Stop it!

1085
01:17:36,432 --> 01:17:38,300
Put the fucking gun down!

1086
01:17:44,406 --> 01:17:45,841
Hey, Carlos...

1087
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:49,311
I'll see you around.

1088
01:17:51,146 --> 01:17:52,381
And, Ryan...

1089
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:55,951
I'll see you around, too.

1090
01:18:00,556 --> 01:18:01,957

It's not gonna be easy, I know.

1098
01:18:53,309 --> 01:18:55,144
Something bad
happened to your father.

1099
01:19:00,983 --> 01:19:02,051
Don't worry.

1100
01:19:03,919 --> 01:19:05,087
We're family.

1101
01:19:06,322 --> 01:19:07,523
You're gonna move with us.

01:19:08,991 --> 01:19:12,094

Cousin Michael...

01:19:16,666 --> 01:19:19,368
Uh... [EXHALES]

1104
01:19:20,903 --> 01:19:22,371
You won't be alone anymore.

1105
01:19:24,173 --> 01:19:25,240
I'll look after you.

1106
01:19:28,944 --> 01:19:30,245
You're like my own son now.

1107
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:38,354
Get your stuff.
I'll wait for you downstairs.

1108
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:30,139
We do them in the morning.

1109
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:36,613
See, you know what I wish?
I wish there was a moment

1110
01:20:36,646 --> 01:20:40,983
where what's gonna happen

1111
01:20:41,016 --> 01:20:42,985
is right there with
what already happened.

1112
01:20:43,018 --> 01:20:46,088
So Carlos can see it,
the cause and the effect.

1113
01:20:47,757 --> 01:20:49,057
How do I do that?

1114
01:20:50,993 --> 01:20:53,663
What I really want is

1115
01:20:53,696 --> 01:20:55,698
that we kill him
more than once, but...

1116
01:21:01,069 --> 01:21:03,105
We park a car in front of
his garage door in the morning,

1117
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:05,407
so when the kid gets out
of the car to open the door,

1118
01:21:05,441 --> 01:21:08,076
then bam, bam, we do him
right there on the sidewalk,

1119
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:10,312
in front of Carlos.

1120
01:21:10,345 --> 01:21:13,616
You got to make sure that
he sees it before you do him.

1121
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:16,151
- I don't really care who does who.

So Carlos sees it.

and talk me out of this?

01:21:39,609 --> 01:21:41,443
Hmm?

1127
01:21:41,477 --> 01:21:43,545
No, there's not much more
to talk about, right?

I was just thinking

01:21:51,086 --> 01:21:53,021
maybe it's better
if you do Carlos yourself,

01:21:53,055 --> 01:21:55,123
