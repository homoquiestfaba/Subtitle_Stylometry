1
00:00:00,843 --> 00:00:03,256
We would like to look
through the anomaly

2
00:00:03,341 --> 00:00:04,781
at an astronomical object

3
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:05,907
over the triangle

4
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:07,875
and see if they seem obscured.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,083
The object I just slewed to
a little while ago

6
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,458
is now no longer
in the database.

7
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:15,667
Erik, the cattle have scattered
through the entire field.

8
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:18,167
Something's definitely scared them.

9
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:19,750
What the hell is that
in the sky?

10
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,374
That thing is big and spherical.

11
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:24,297
Yes, it is. It's got
a black dot in the center of it.

12
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:26,416
There's something that
I'd like to get your eyes on.

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,008
- There. There.
- Oh, what was that?

14
00:00:28,093 --> 00:00:29,801
That's the brightest thing
in the sky!

15
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:35,273
There is a ranch
in Northern Utah.

16
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,305
It is considered the epicenter

17
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,667
of the strangest and most
disturbing phenomena on Earth:

18
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,958
Animal mutilations,

19
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:47,458
bizarre UFO sightings

20
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:52,833
and unusual energies that have
proven harmful to humans.

21
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:55,167
For 20 years,
the federal government

22
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,458
tried to find answers
and failed.

23
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:02,625
Now a new team
of dedicated scientists,

24
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,500
researchers and experts
has taken over.

25
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:10,417
They are determined to solve
the mystery and reveal...

26
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:17,093
...The Secret
of Skinwalker Ranch.

27
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,469
So, Kaleb just came in
after being out on patrol

28
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:35,250
and mentioned
that it looks like

29
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:37,742
we have a downed cow
out here in the field, so,

30
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,333
Kaleb, Thomas, myself...

31
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:43,542
We're gonna go check it out.

32
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:46,750
Oh, man, she doesn't
look good, does she?

33
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,208
Yeah, she's not
doing well... at all.

34
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:58,542
Boy, her eyes don't
look good, either.

35
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:01,750
Yeah, she doesn't look
very healthy at all.

36
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,000
Hey. Oh, you're good.

37
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,083
You're good.

38
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,624
Oh, come on up, girl.

39
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,042
Get up. Come on.

40
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,667
How many years did we go

41
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,333
without any cattle having
any issues whatsoever,

42
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:17,250
and now we're drilling,

43
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,583
we're doing all kinds
of stuff, and all of a sudden,

44
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:24,375
two out of three years, we've
got cows that are in bad shape?

45
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:38,958
- How's it going?
- Good. How are you, Donavon?

46
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:40,208
- Good.
- Good to see you.

47
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,125
Good to see you, too.

48
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,375
Morning, Richard.

49
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,250
- Hey, Tommy.
- How are you?

50
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,208
Good. How are you?

51
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,083
Oh, doing pretty good.
Good to see you out.

52
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,875
Yeah, good to be out.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,167
So, uh, we got this cow

54
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,250
that's down here
that we called you about.

55
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,875
There's one cow now

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,124
that's starting
to separate herself

57
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,292
from the group, and

58
00:02:59,417 --> 00:03:01,333
appears to be struggling.

59
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,333
My first thought is
to always notify the rancher.

60
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,333
These animals don't belong
to us.

61
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,708
512 acres is a lot
of ground to maintain,

62
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,875
and we bring the cows on
to help keep the grass down.

63
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:12,624
You know, I don't... I don't
know what the deal is with her,

64
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,500
or what her problem is,
but hopefully,

65
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,750
you can look at her
and figure out what's going on.

66
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,875
- Well, let's go see
what she's doing.
- Okay.

67
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,917
It's not that mysterious

68
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:24,833
for a cow
to get sick on a ranch,

69
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:28,333
but there were several
odd coincidences about this cow

70
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,291
that Thomas, Dragon and Kaleb
found acting bizarre

71
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,542
out in the south field.

72
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,166
One... this happened
only a couple nights

73
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,333
after our telescope
and rocket experiment

74
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,958
where two different UAPs
appeared in the sky.

75
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,542
I am getting something
on the 1.6.

76
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:45,375
Two... those UAPs appeared

77
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:47,583
just after Erik detected
another dangerous

78
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,624
RF radiation reading
of 1.6 gigahertz,

79
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,908
and the cows got all spooked
and started running around.

80
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,458
Erik, the cows have
pushed in on us.

81
00:03:56,542 --> 00:04:00,333
And three...
This cow is acting strange

82
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,583
in the exact same location

83
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,542
where a cow actually died
two years ago

84
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,792
just as a UAP appeared
in the sky above it.

85
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:10,833
This herd seems pretty docile.

86
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,417
Do you ever see

87
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,958
aggression out of cows
anywhere other than here?

88
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:18,332
Well, what seems weird to me

89
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:20,832
is when you have one cow
out of the whole herd

90
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:22,917
that starts going mental.

91
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:25,123
And I've never had that

92
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:26,250
- on our ranch.
- Hmm.

93
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,250
- Only here?
- Only here.

94
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,667
- Wow.
- Interesting.

95
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,292
That's very interesting.

96
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:33,332
Just as we have many
scientific instruments,

97
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:35,667
sensors and cameras
deployed across the ranch,

98
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:38,123
we also speak
of the animals here

99
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:40,167
as bio sensors.

100
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:41,572
And it's natural
for us to wonder

101
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:43,250
whether there might be something

102
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,082
connected
to our recent experiment.

103
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,167
Well, see, there's, uh...

104
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:49,583
Yeah, she's starting to move.

105
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,750
Get up, get up.
There. Good deal.

106
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,417
It's weird. It looks like
she's trying to move all...

107
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:56,022
She's gonna go down, Donavon.

108
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,042
You got to get in front of her.

109
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,750
Wow.

110
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,999
- She's down, she's down.
- Yeah. - She might be...

111
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,833
- Yup. See, now she starts...
- Yes.

112
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,166
- Getting aggressive right there. Shh. Shh.
- Yeah.

113
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,042
- Shh.
- She's got a gaze on us.

114
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,541
Dad, I got her, I got her.
Get back!

115
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,666
- He's on her.
- Get back! Get back!

116
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,208
Luca, back.

117
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,666
Come on.

118
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,167
Ah.

119
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:20,167
Let her... let her lay down.

120
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:22,667
- She's really in distress.
- Yeah.

121
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:26,166
What I think we'll do,
Tommy, is take her home,

122
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,998
and see if she acts
any different at home.

123
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:30,707
She's totally agitated.

124
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:33,375
I think there's something going
on. I don't know what it is.

125
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,332
I don't like thinking about it,
I don't want to be around it.

126
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:37,542
It's a mystery.

127
00:05:37,707 --> 00:05:39,667
Sorry this happened.

128
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:42,498
We appreciate you coming and
bringing your animals out here.

129
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:45,417
Hopefully, this doesn't sour you
on the place too much.

130
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,957
Well, we'll see.

131
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:03,499
After Erik and I
heard about the cow,

132
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,124
we decided it was time
to reach back out

133
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,291
to someone
who we know was not only

134
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,291
a former investigator
on the ranch,

135
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,833
but also had his own experiences
with bizarre cattle incidents...

136
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,624
Retired Army Colonel
John Alexander.

137
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,332
- Thanks for coming out. We appreciate it.
- Okay.

138
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:21,166
Colonel Alexander was
a key member

139
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,000
of billionaire
Robert Bigelow's team,

140
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:25,375
who studied phenomena
on the ranch for two decades,

141
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,667
starting back in 1996.

142
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:31,167
Hey, guys.
You remember Colonel Alexander?

143
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,998
So, given everything
we've been experiencing

144
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:34,666
recently at the triangle,

145
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,332
which now seems to be affecting
the cattle, as well,

146
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:39,083
we were grateful
that he agreed to come back

147
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:42,832
and share information that
could help our investigation.

148
00:06:42,957 --> 00:06:45,123
So, is this the first time
you've been back to the ranch

149
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:46,042
since the Bigelow era?

150
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:47,750
Been a couple decades.

151
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,667
- Wow.
- Looks a little different.

152
00:06:49,832 --> 00:06:51,592
The topography looks the same.
The rest of it

153
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:54,457
has kind of, uh...
has been updated quite a bit.

154
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,332
I was a colonel in the Army,

155
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,167
I was in special operations,

156
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,791
and finally, as director
of advanced system concepts.

157
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:07,750
The second career was
Los Alamos National Laboratory,

158
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:11,000
where we did all
the non-lethal weapons concepts.

159
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:15,542
I had just left Los Alamos,
and in mid '95,

160
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:18,457
Bob Bigelow decided
to create NIDS...

161
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:20,332
National Institute
for Discovery Science...

162
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:22,957
And I was the first
NIDS employee.

163
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:27,457
NIDS was formed for the purpose
of looking at UFOs.

164
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:30,707
Skinwalker presented that
and so much more.

165
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:33,582
We would like to see

166
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:36,375
if you have some insight
from your past here

167
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:39,332
that might spur us
into some other experiments

168
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,875
that we might like to do.

169
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:44,791
So, during the time
that you guys were here,

170
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,875
can you, uh,
think of a specific

171
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,498
event that was the most
disturbing or impactful?

172
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:54,750
Especially something, like, with a cow?

173
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,625
I wouldn't know where
to begin with that one.

174
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,000
Um, when NIDS was created
in mid '95,

175
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:06,250
Terry Sherman was prepared
to sell the ranch,

176
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,667
and so, Bob Bigelow
made him an offer.

177
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:10,541
- After he s... bought the ranch...
- So he stayed on

178
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,083
- as the ranch manager?
- He-he stayed on

179
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,750
as the ranch manager.

180
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,917
So it was calving season.
Terry went out,

181
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:19,707
found a newborn,
tag it and weighed it.

182
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,832
Drives across, as you know,
perfectly open field,

183
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,791
finds another newborn, tags it
and weighs it, comes back.

184
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:32,000
And the mother's going berserk,
and calf one is dead.

185
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:36,167
Not only is it dead,
but there's about 40 pounds

186
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,042
of stuff is missing.

187
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:41,332
It's eviscerated,
exsanguinated,

188
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:43,750
ear had been sliced off.

189
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,083
Hearing the strange details
of this calf

190
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,750
being mutilated in broad
daylight reminds me again

191
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,333
of the cow that died
after we first stimulated UAPs

192
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,875
to appear above the triangle
two years ago.

193
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,500
What in the world?

194
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,750
Tom Winter ton found the cow
right after it died,

195
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,042
and alerted us
to go investigate it.

196
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,791
The meter's just going crazy.

197
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,917
Almost immediately,
we began detecting high readings

198
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,624
of RF radiation
with our TriField meters,

199
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,333
so we got out of there.

200
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:15,583
What we'll do is go forward
very slowly.

201
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,125
But then, we reviewed
the surveillance footage

202
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,542
that captured the moment
of the cow's death

203
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,583
and saw a UAP
in the sky right above it.

204
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,500
Since that day, we've wondered
if we might have stopped

205
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,667
a mutilation from happening.

206
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:29,666
But it's also very curious

207
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,708
that both the Bigelow team
and our team

208
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,999
had cows die under very
inexplicable circumstances

209
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,500
right after we first began
investigating phenomena

210
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,500
on Skinwalker Ranch.

211
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,791
It made me wonder
what other similarities

212
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,958
we've both experienced.

213
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:46,958
What's really interesting is,
a lot of times when we do have

214
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:49,833
these anomalies, we are
detecting a strange signal

215
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:53,583
that we can't identify
at 1.6 something gigahertz.

216
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,750
- Okay.
- And, so,

217
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,458
I guess the question
we would have is,

218
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,917
during the time
that you guys were here,

219
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:06,458
did you record or see things
that looked like this signal

220
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:08,292
at 1.6 gigahertz?

221
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,333
Well, as you know, I've dealt

222
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,666
with the UFO phenomena
quite a bit,

223
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,875
and-and that is one
of the perplexing aspects,

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,958
is things like
these sort of signals.

225
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:23,166
And these things occur
in many, many areas,

226
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,833
and why is it that we see things
that shouldn't be there,

227
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,125
and don't see things
that we should see?

228
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,500
- Yup.
- For instance, we would set up cameras, and say,

229
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,000
"Okay, we're gonna...
If it's happening here,

230
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,000
we're gonna watch
in that location,"

231
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,999
but you get nothing,

232
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,833
and things
would happen off camera.

233
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,667
Sometimes
the most important data

234
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,167
are the ones we can't collect.

235
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:46,833
The fact that something
is interfering, which is

236
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:49,167
- very often the case here.
- Right.

237
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,500
So, the other thing
I wanted to ask you is,

238
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,833
we've heard
about opening portals.

239
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:55,667
Uh, what can you tell us
about those?

240
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:58,833
The closest to
what you're asking

241
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:01,624
is the incident out at...
near the second homestead.

242
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,333
You know,
something moving through

243
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,583
the Russian olives out there,

244
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,042
through the trees.

245
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,750
We were aware of kind of
a slight distortion.

246
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,833
You didn't see a thing; It was
more of distortions moving.

247
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,374
After their investigation ended,

248
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,500
the NIDS team put forth the idea

249
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,000
that a portal connected
to another dimension

250
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,875
causes the phenomena
that happened on the ranch.

251
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,458
I don't know
if that could really explain

252
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:28,292
what's happened
during our experiments,

253
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:31,417
but we've seen some crazy stuff
at Homestead Two as well.

254
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:35,000
Last year,
we used thermal imaging

255
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:37,750
at night to capture
a circular temperature vortex

256
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,375
that was at least
20 degrees colder

257
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:41,917
than any of its surroundings.

258
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:43,917
Oh, whoa.

259
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,250
And when we reviewed
our footage, we saw something

260
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,167
moving erratically
in front of the homestead.

261
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,000
Now, I'm still not ready to say
a portal or a wormhole exists

262
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,667
on Skinwalker Ranch,
but it is amazing

263
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,542
that other researchers

264
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,375
and scientists believe
that it could.

265
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:01,666
So what I'm taking from this
is that there is a long history

266
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,208
of unusual phenomena
without an identifiable source

267
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,333
in this basin.

268
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:11,042
And I'm learning that there
were no answers produced

269
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,166
as a result
of the previous research here.

270
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,667
- That's kind of surprising.
- Right.

271
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:19,124
Because that burden
that we're bearing today is

272
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:22,167
that our own conclusions
don't make sense to us yet.

273
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:25,291
It's been a frustration,
almost become a joke.

274
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,458
Yes, but I think you're
operating under the illusion

275
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:28,833
that you're in control.

276
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,625
You're not in control.

277
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,292
There's an "it"
that's in control.

278
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,417
Whatever "it" was seemed
to know how we would respond

279
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:47,125
before the event even occurred.

280
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,000
It was not responding

281
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:53,083
in a way
that we would anticipate.

282
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,417
And every time
you tried to anticipate,

283
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:59,042
it would just morph to something
a little bit different.

284
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,833
Like I say, you like that?
Try this.

285
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,291
I'm really interested in how
you arrived at that impression,

286
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,083
that overall assessment
of what was going on here,

287
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:10,625
from having experiments
not go as you planned

288
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,750
to there being an "it."

289
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,750
When a physical event
had occurred,

290
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,999
something would happen.

291
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,250
Theoretically,
can some of these happen, yes,

292
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,792
but when you look
at it practically,

293
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,624
it just makes no sense at all.

294
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:27,000
It was when "it" decided

295
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,917
to present us with something
that the events occurred.

296
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:34,583
We inherited this narrative

297
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,917
that it's dangerous
to dig on the ranch.

298
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:39,333
My question to you is,

299
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:42,917
are you aware of any exercises
during the Bigelow era

300
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:44,917
where they may have
done experiments

301
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:47,250
that included
digging and watching?

302
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,167
I'm familiar with that.

303
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,792
The digging

304
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,666
was to see if some sort

305
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,167
of phenomena
would manifest itself.

306
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:01,833
If we can do something
that will cause a response.

307
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,833
And sometimes incidents happen.

308
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:07,542
While we've got you here,

309
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:09,000
we could take you around

310
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,208
and show you some places
on the ranch.

311
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,041
- You show us where you think things happened.
- Well, yeah,

312
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,042
well, one of my areas
of interest is revisiting

313
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,124
- where some of these events took place at.
- That would be great

314
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,708
- for you to tell us that.
- That'd be helpful to us.

315
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,958
- Yeah, that'd be very helpful.
- So, uh,

316
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:23,208
with that in mind,
I think we should load up

317
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,333
and head out.

318
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,375
- This particular area is...
- This is the triangle?

319
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,375
- Yeah, it's been...
- The infamous triangle.

320
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:35,333
I'll tell you, it's really more

321
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,125
about phenomena in the sky
above the triangle than actually

322
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,708
- on the triangle.
- Oh, yeah.

323
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,124
Colonel Alexander told us
a lot of different stories

324
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,875
about phenomena they had seen
back in the Bigelow era.

325
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,500
So, what we thought was,
him showing us

326
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,375
where these things happened
might give us some insight

327
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,249
of where we might want
to do some experiments

328
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,333
to reproduce it
and maybe capture some data.

329
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,166
- This place look familiar to you, John?
- Oh, yes.

330
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,958
The story that sticks with me is

331
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:07,833
your account
of the portal opening up.

332
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,875
Oh, yes. Well, it was
a little bit farther up.

333
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:16,667
Back in the NIDS days,
multiple eyewitnesses

334
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,500
have written
about these phenomena.

335
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,667
Maybe there is some connection

336
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:23,083
with whatever
these phenomena are,

337
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,875
what they've seen in the past,
and what we're seeing today.

338
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,708
It was around this corner
right here

339
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,500
where we had
the radiation spikes.

340
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,166
Uh, near this cistern.

341
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,958
Well, that's interesting because
this is one of the few areas

342
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,583
I have some old pictures from.

343
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,042
Y'all measured for gamma rays
and stuff like that?

344
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,333
Yeah, what...
They used the TriField meters

345
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:48,917
- and whatnot, but, uh...
- You know why this is open?

346
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:50,291
Do you know why that's open?

347
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,458
I don't know why
that's open, either.

348
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:57,708
- I wonder who opened it up.
- Uh...

349
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,916
'Cause I don't... Someone's
been here and opened this up.

350
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,875
It's always closed.

351
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,833
It usually is closed
because we don't want anyone

352
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:07,167
or anything falling in there.

353
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:10,333
Yeah, somebody's opened this up.

354
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,333
Two years ago, I was exposed
to dangerous levels

355
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,292
of ionizing radiation coming
directly from this cistern

356
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:22,708
that left burns
on my hand and face.

357
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,083
Ever since then, we've had
radiation sensors placed

358
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,708
all around the ranch
just to be safe.

359
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,792
And seeing the lid off this
cistern is not just curious.

360
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:33,708
It's concerning.

361
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,583
- I don't know why...
- That...

362
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:36,988
It's heavy, too.
It ain't just...

363
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,291
- It is.
- Yeah.

364
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,042
You got it, Tom?

365
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,917
Why is that open?

366
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,833
Somebody opened it.

367
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm just trying
to figure out who.

368
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,166
We need to get
to the bottom of that.

369
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,083
Did y'all have weird stuff
like that happen?

370
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,875
You know, things being
one orientation,

371
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,417
and you come back,
and it's moved?

372
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:59,167
Yeah, but it's...
The problem was like this...

373
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:01,125
You notice it after the fact.

374
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,666
So, where do you think
the, uh, portal was?

375
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,832
- From... out in the field. Yeah.
- Oh, from out there?

376
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,356
Oh, show us...
show us where that is.

377
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:15,375
Yeah, out in this general area.

378
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,000
And it's sort of moving
through the treetops here.

379
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,416
Again, it was more of
a distortion.

380
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,250
This was early evening.
Our guys were down there,

381
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,124
and it was kind of
a disturbance.

382
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,958
You didn't actually
see a thing.

383
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:31,624
It was more
of distortions moving.

384
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,333
Just so I'm clear,
it was almost like

385
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,875
- the cloaked movement...
- Yeah, like something moving

386
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,124
- through the treetops.
- Okay.

387
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,458
- A disturbance...
- Mm-hmm.

388
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:42,417
...in the visual spectrum
as it goes across.

389
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,249
They only were able to see it
through the night vision

390
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,583
cameras? Is that correct?

391
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,458
- Yeah.
- Okay.

392
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,917
- Okay.
- Well.

393
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:54,291
So, why don't we head that way?

394
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,042
Let's go up through here
so we can avoid the water.

395
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,499
Okay, you lead the way, Thomas.

396
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,667
It's a good thing to reach out
to people that have been here

397
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,458
and other research efforts
to understand this place.

398
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,583
This is a strange place.
Weird things happen.

399
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:11,417
Anybody that has any insight...
That's gonna be useful data.

400
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,875
The caretakers
that were here after,

401
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
uh, the Shermans left,
had indicated that

402
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,167
Bigelow's team...
They actually used a bulldozer,

403
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:23,750
and done some trenches
here in this field.

404
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,666
It was more a disturbance.

405
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,917
The intent was not
to dig, per se. It was just,

406
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,375
we'll screw with things
and see if...

407
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,083
- See if you could stimulate it?
- Oh, yeah.

408
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,624
To quote Travis,
they were trying

409
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,000
to poke the hornet's nest?

410
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,417
- Yeah.
- I see.

411
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,250
Do you know,
did they ever feel

412
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,542
like they got a response
from any of that?

413
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:48,291
Yeah. Well, we just discussed
the one with the portal.

414
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,833
- Yeah.
- You get something like that...

415
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:53,458
- Sure.
- It wasn't like we tried

416
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:56,166
to orchestrate the response.

417
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,125
It was, do we get a response?

418
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,208
- What does that look like?
- Okay.

419
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,667
- Yeah.
- Listening to you talk about it, you know, I...

420
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,500
in the back of my mind I say,

421
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:07,208
"Well, if Bigelow's team
dug there once,

422
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,624
"I want to go dig
there again and see

423
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,083
- if strange things happen."
- Right.

424
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,166
We dig again
to see if it's repeatable.

425
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,917
- Yup.
- And so, do you reckon

426
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:18,124
that if we were
to come in and dig again,

427
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,958
we would get a response?

428
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,458
Um... don't know.

429
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:25,542
Where you dig
makes a difference.

430
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,333
Well, we find support
for the idea that when

431
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:33,667
we do things, we do see what
we interpret as a response.

432
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:36,041
- Right.
- And so, that's what we're weighing out right now.

433
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,667
How do we proceed with that?

434
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:39,833
Well, while we've been
standing here talking,

435
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,042
I've been scanning
over this field.

436
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,848
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, for it being a level

437
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:47,917
field, I see a pretty good
bulldozer-width indentation

438
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:50,000
right here
between these two trees.

439
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,667
- Oh, yeah.
- I think

440
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:54,500
that that would be a great spot
to come in and dig again.

441
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,500
Oh, that would be
a real good idea.

442
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,833
- Then see what happens with the front.
- Yeah.

443
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:02,124
Well, John, thank you so much
for coming out here.

444
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,875
I know we're losing daylight, so
we want to get you back safely,

445
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,833
- so, if we pile in and head out?
- Whenever you're ready, so...

446
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:08,374
- Yeah, let's head back.
- Okay, thank you. - Yeah.

447
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,166
Colonel Alexander

448
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,833
and the previous team
witnessed so many

449
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,667
stunning events that really

450
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:16,667
laid the foundation
for the research

451
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:19,875
that we took forward
to present day.

452
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,417
The information and insight that
he had shared with the team

453
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:25,667
helped shape the nature
of our investigation.

454
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,333
Well, we all got quite a bit
on our plates.

455
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:38,375
After Colonel
John Alexander told us

456
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,167
that the NIDS team dug
near Homestead Two,

457
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:43,166
and stimulated
what they believed

458
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,458
to be portal activity
on the ranch,

459
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,375
Thomas rented
an industrial-sized bulldozer

460
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:49,667
so we could dig
in that exact same area

461
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,166
to see what might happen.

462
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,750
Oh, here he comes.

463
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:55,958
- What's up, Thomas?
- How was... how was

464
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:57,291
your sports car ride over here?

465
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,695
- Rough.
- Yeah, I'll bet.

466
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,500
I'll bet it was.

467
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,083
So I'm thinking we just go down,
what, four or five feet?

468
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,249
That makes sense. The height of
the blade or something, right?

469
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,041
- Or until we hit water, I guess.
- Yeah, yeah.

470
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,333
I don't want to bury that.

471
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:11,542
So you maybe take
about a-a foot off first,

472
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:14,083
and we can look at it, and then,
take another couple of feet.

473
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,791
- Oh, yeah.
- Then maybe get down to where...

474
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,624
- Maybe something like that?
- Yeah, that sounds good.

475
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,167
Well, it goes without saying,

476
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:22,000
we need to just keep an eye
on ourselves.

477
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,000
If you start feeling
anything funny,

478
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,499
obviously,
let somebody know, because

479
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,208
when you dig,
bad stuff actually does happens.

480
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,500
Yeah, so if you guys see

481
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,458
- anything start to elevate, let me know...
- Yeah.

482
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,624
- And I'm gonna shut her down.
- I'm gonna sit here and watch.

483
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,228
I'm gonna sit here
and watch constantly

484
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,791
while you're doing it.
I'm not gonna let you

485
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,708
be out here digging
without this... without one us

486
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:41,124
- being out here with a Geiger counter.
- Yeah.

487
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,124
- Yeah. What are you reading?
- Right now,

488
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,375
we're at normal background.

489
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:45,833
- 12. Yeah.
- 12 micro?

490
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:48,208
As a precaution
for this experiment, Erik had

491
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,000
the spectrum analyzer
scanning the area

492
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:52,750
for the 1.6 gigahertz RF signal,

493
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:56,375
and we both also had
Geiger counter devices

494
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:59,083
to look out for harmful spikes
in gamma radiation.

495
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,917
When we dug last year
in the south field

496
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,833
near where the cow died,

497
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:05,750
we detected gamma rays
three times the normal level.

498
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,625
All right, I think, uh...
I think we got it covered.

499
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,917
- Thomas, you ready to dig?
- Yeah, I'm ready to dig.

500
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:20,624
Rolling this D8 dozer across...
This is definitely

501
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,108
the largest bulldozer that has
ever been on Skinwalker Ranch.

502
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:29,083
Nothing unusual.

503
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,333
After seeing

504
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,583
some of the data
that we've received

505
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,375
after digging other holes
on the ranch,

506
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,100
it'll be interesting
to see what happens.

507
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:40,458
That looks like that may be a
little harder to dig, don't it?

508
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:41,833
It does.

509
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:45,708
Hey, Dragon, Erik,
y'all seeing anything?

510
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,333
Yeah. Me, either.

511
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,042
Ugh. That's not good.

512
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:03,833
We really haven't

513
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,624
even gotten that deep down
in the soil

514
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:08,292
when the bulldozer
just bogs down and dies.

515
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:12,000
This big of a dozer should be
able to handle this very easily.

516
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:14,624
It's just another event
in a long list of experiments

517
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,791
that haven't gone the way
that we planned.

518
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:20,708
So, guys, I didn't shut it off.
It bogged down, and it-it died.

519
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,750
But, uh, it's telling me
it's got a dead battery.

520
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,833
Didn't they just put
two new ones in it?

521
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,291
- Like, an hour ago.
- Yeah.

522
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,333
I got to tell you,

523
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:30,583
I wish
I had a voltmeter out here.

524
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,250
So why don't we run back

525
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,791
- and get one just to see? - Yeah.
- Yeah.

526
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,624
It doesn't look
like that's going anywhere.

527
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,167
It was like, here we go again.

528
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,458
We just get started digging
to stimulate a ranch response,

529
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:44,750
and the fully-charged battery
in the bulldozer dies.

530
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,416
I'm gonna keep fidgeting
around with this.

531
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,833
- Yeah, yeah. All right.
- Maybe it'll...

532
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:49,500
Okay.

533
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:54,667
- Man, were you expecting that?
- No.

534
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:57,624
Was that the ranch responding?
I don't know.

535
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,791
So while Erik
and Dragon went back

536
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,555
to the command center
to get his voltmeter,

537
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,458
and also
to process the collected data

538
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,375
from gamma ray detector,

539
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,083
the rest of us hung back

540
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:10,917
just in case something even
more strange would happen next.

541
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,125
Hey, Bryant,

542
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,000
I want you to see this.

543
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,875
We've got a couple flavors of
strangeness going here, Bryant.

544
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,124
- Look! What the actual hell is this?
- What?

545
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:27,667
While the guys were trying
to fix the bulldozer,

546
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:29,750
I saw a massive spike
in radiation

547
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:32,833
in our gamma ray detectors
stationed near Homestead Two

548
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:35,583
in the area
where they were digging.

549
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,208
It could be very dangerous
for anyone in that location.

550
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:40,542
- This is not seven!
- Is that 3400?

551
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,791
It's almost 3500.

552
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:46,499
These are very inexplicable
spikes,

553
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:49,124
as if something artificial
could be generating them.

554
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:52,499
- You got to get those people out of there.
- Okay.

555
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:54,833
That... that's...

556
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,542
What's wrong?

557
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:06,917
Erik pulled the data.
There was a spike at 3400.

558
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:08,542
- 3400?
- 3400.

559
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,499
Everybody out of here now!
Everybody out.

560
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:16,250
Erik just picked up a gamma ray
source that was 3400

561
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:19,166
micro roentgen per hour.

562
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,417
That's a significant dose.

563
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:24,250
That's enough dose ray
that it could be dangerous.

564
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:26,208
In terms of gamma rays,

565
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:29,000
that's almost 300 times
what would be normal and safe.

566
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,667
You guys, come on.

567
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:34,083
We had to immediately
evacuate the area

568
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,791
and go see if we could get to
the bottom of what's going on.

569
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,167
Erik was like,
"Go get 'em out of there."

570
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:42,667
What's going on, Erik?

571
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:46,167
Travis, you got to see this.

572
00:25:46,292 --> 00:25:47,667
You are not going to like it.

573
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:49,666
I want you to see...
This is what we just logged

574
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,250
in that field between Homestead
Two and Homestead Three.

575
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,667
- Okay, now, look.
- Holy...

576
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:55,042
- Look what we got.
- Yeah.

577
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,083
- And I want you to see...
- Look at that.

578
00:25:57,208 --> 00:26:01,167
It's-it's almost
3,500 micro roentgens per hour.

579
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,958
Now get this. You've got other
strange behavior here that...

580
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:06,833
- Uh-oh. Zeroes. Yeah.
- Zeroes.

581
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,680
- Something has interfered...
- Oh.

582
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,833
...with the data collection
process.

583
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:12,333
- There's three hours missing here.
- It's gone.

584
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:13,833
It's gone.

585
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,917
What's really weird is,

586
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:18,625
there was a big spike
in the gamma rays,

587
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,958
and then, there was
a complete hole in the data,

588
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:25,624
meaning the meter said
zero radiation.

589
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,292
A gamma ray detector
can't do that.

590
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:29,083
Even if you put it
in a lead box,

591
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:33,083
it's still gonna give you some
background reading, not zero.

592
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:36,583
Here's the thing.
So, either we're getting

593
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:39,875
these horrible gamma rays

594
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:41,458
- at this level... Okay.
- Yeah.

595
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:43,292
...or something's hacking us.

596
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:45,624
Either one isn't good, but

597
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:46,958
we got to treat it
like it's the gamma rays

598
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:48,499
'cause that's the most dangerous
right now.

599
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:51,124
If this is saying,
"Don't dig here,"

600
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,666
then that's the big,
blinky sign that says,

601
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,667
we need to dig right there.

602
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,752
- Right.
- And that's what I've said from day one.

603
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,667
And I guess...
this only reinforces that.

604
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,791
My question in response is,

605
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,625
what is the smartest way
to follow up,

606
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,833
and what is the safest way
to follow up?

607
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,041
Well, the smartest,
safest way, the first thing

608
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:10,667
we got to do is,
we need to determine

609
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:12,500
- what this is, right?
- Mm-hmm.

610
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,667
If something was to happen

611
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,917
to any of us,
I mean, this is bad stuff.

612
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:21,208
Now that the radiation levels
are back

613
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:23,833
to normal, I think
we should wait until tonight,

614
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,666
and go back out there to see
what else we can stimulate.

615
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,833
We'll be careful
like Dragon wants,

616
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:31,417
monitoring the whole time
with Geiger counters

617
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:32,667
and the spectrum analyzer,

618
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:34,875
but we need
to keep poking this nest

619
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,291
to see what we can reveal
about Skinwalker Ranch.

620
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:40,458
To be honest, I'm not worried
about going back out there,

621
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:43,124
if you're there monitoring.

622
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:44,666
All right, great.

623
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,167
Thanks, Erik.

624
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:52,958
Yeah, right in here
in all these damn weeds.

625
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:55,000
We waited until nightfall

626
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,000
to go back out
near Homestead Two

627
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:59,708
to see if we could stimulate
more phenomena to appear

628
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,667
that might prove or disprove

629
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,125
Colonel Alexander
and NIDS' theory

630
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,791
that a portal might exist
on Skinwalker Ranch.

631
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:09,417
All right, I want to get where
I can see the bulldozer.

632
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:11,022
Well, I think we can see it...

633
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:14,374
- Yeah, it's right there.
- Yeah, there it is.

634
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:17,000
Let's get our stuff set up.

635
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:20,208
Now, the plan was
to set up a safe distance

636
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,000
from the dead bulldozer

637
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:24,542
and use what's become
our tried-and-true method

638
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:25,333
for stimulating phenomena.

639
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Watch your hand.

640
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:27,499
Launching a rocket.

641
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,833
We are ready to launch!

642
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,833
We also set up a spectrum
analyzer to look out

643
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:34,000
for any strange RF energy.

644
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:36,166
Okay, so this is up and running.

645
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,458
And we put a Geiger counter
right next

646
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:39,250
to the stalled bulldozer

647
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,167
to check for any more
dangerous gamma rays.

648
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:44,166
- That's really, really low.
- Good. That makes me happy.

649
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,917
We also brought out

650
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:48,000
a night vision
monocular scope so that

651
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:49,875
we could safely observe
from a distance

652
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:52,708
if anything weird happened
over there.

653
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:54,193
At this stage
in the investigation,

654
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:57,042
safety was still paramount,
as always.

655
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:58,583
Going hot!

656
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:00,375
But we all agree that we need

657
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,917
to be aggressive
in order to get some answers.

658
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,999
- Thomas, you ready?
- Yeah, whenever you are.

659
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:08,583
All right, here we go. Five,

660
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:11,250
four, three,

661
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,458
two,

662
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:15,708
one.

663
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:24,624
- Oh, got the chute.
- We got the chute!

664
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:26,917
It's coming down
right over here.

665
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:29,667
Coming down fast.

666
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:33,000
The chute hasn't opened.

667
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,417
Boom!

668
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:37,167
Now, Kaleb, you got it?

669
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:40,124
Oh, yeah, it landed
right in a tree.

670
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:43,750
I'm looking for any UAPs.

671
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:47,499
I don't see nothing.

672
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:49,666
While Kaleb's getting that,
I'm gonna go over here and check

673
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,042
the instruments and stuff.

674
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,208
He may need some help.
I don't know.

675
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,000
Kaleb, you need help?

676
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:57,833
I got it.

677
00:29:57,958 --> 00:30:01,083
I can't figure out why
the chute didn't open, though.

678
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:03,624
Erik, are you doing
something at 1.6?

679
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,875
I'm not broadcasting.

680
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:07,333
What are you seeing?

681
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:09,250
A signal?

682
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:12,791
1.60000...

683
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:15,833
When the chute failed to open,

684
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:17,833
and the rocket crashed down
near the homestead,

685
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:19,500
I didn't want to jump
to conclusions,

686
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:21,208
but then, right on cue,

687
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,708
Erik's spectrum analyzer
registered that freaky,

688
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:26,875
1.6 gigahertz energy level
that has coincided

689
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,042
with almost every phenomenon
we've witnessed out here.

690
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:33,625
- You want me sweeping around? It's...
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

691
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,791
Something was starting
to happen.

692
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:39,542
Oh, whoa, whoa! Right there.

693
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:42,250
The one signal went away.

694
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,166
Go back the other way.

695
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,125
Well, it's coming back. Oh,
right there, right there. Stop.

696
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,208
- So, it's very directional?
- Yes.

697
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:52,000
That's southwest.

698
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:53,666
That's right
where the rocket just went.

699
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,499
Yeah.

700
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,875
Are you kidding me?

701
00:30:58,042 --> 00:30:59,875
Thomas's thought
to turn the antenna

702
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,292
connected
to the spectrum analyzer

703
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:05,083
was brilliant
because it clearly showed us

704
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:07,000
that the 1.6 gigahertz signal

705
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,666
was coming from
the same direction in the sky

706
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,292
that the rocket
had just flown through.

707
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:14,333
The question was,
what the hell was it?

708
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:17,083
Let me... let me go up
and down with it.

709
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:21,958
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop.

710
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:27,833
Suddenly, two signals
right when you did that.

711
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So, look, we've got three peaks.

712
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:32,792
That means nothing to me.

713
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:34,124
Well, it doesn't mean a lot
to us except,

714
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:35,624
usually,
if it's a communication signal,

715
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:36,958
you'll see one big one
in the middle

716
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:38,666
and then, two smaller ones
on the side.

717
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,624
- At equal distances.
- And that's kind of

718
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:40,999
what we're seeing,

719
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,883
but this one's coming
and going, which is odd.

720
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:46,917
- Want to try and listen to it?
- Yeah.

721
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:56,124
It's chirping in frequency.

722
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:59,792
That's a communication signal
or something.

723
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:02,208
- That's...
- So all that disappears

724
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:04,291
- when you go off down here?
- Yeah, yeah.

725
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:06,083
I mean, it's got
to be right there, and...

726
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:09,166
I mean, it's got to...
It's a small, a very small cone.

727
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,792
That's interesting.

728
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:13,958
So, if it were
a deep sky object,

729
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:16,167
- in 15 minutes, it'd be gone.
- Mm-hmm.

730
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:18,124
Because of the rotation
of the Earth.

731
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,791
From my experience
as a rocket scientist,

732
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:22,166
this sound frequency was

733
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,333
like the kind of communication
signal you would get

734
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,250
from a satellite
orbiting the Earth,

735
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:28,458
or even farther out in space.

736
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:30,083
Listen to that!

737
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,958
But the signal was coming
from the area

738
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,583
above the ranch
where we shot the rocket,

739
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:37,542
and it was pointed directly
at Homestead Two.

740
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:40,166
So, what would be broadcasting
a communication signal

741
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,166
like that, and where
could it be coming from?

742
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,875
Okay, so you say it's pointed

743
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,333
to where we just
shot the rocket.

744
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:49,208
So, what? That's our message,

745
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:51,375
and this is the message
coming back?

746
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:56,125
I mean, I know that's a stretch,
but , after everything

747
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,124
that's gone down today,
I have no clue.

748
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:00,167
That's not a...
I don't know.

749
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:03,000
I swear that sounds
like a communication signal.

750
00:33:07,042 --> 00:33:08,583
It stopped.

751
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:19,167
I don't know what elsep
to say about it. I mean,

752
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:21,917
everything's been quiet,
except for that thing.

753
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,874
But, yeah, the Geiger counter
hadn't had a single

754
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:27,791
thing over, like,
15 or 16 all night.

755
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:29,458
- Good.
- I know.

756
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:31,375
- Good.
- Right?

757
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,833
Uh, confusing, but good.

758
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,042
We've had a hell of a day.

759
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:38,333
That mysterious 1.6 gigahertz

760
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:41,417
frequency sound
suddenly stopped.

761
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:44,583
Now, I'm not sure, but to me,
it sounded like some sort

762
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,333
of communication signal.

763
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,542
It's crazy to think about,
but we need to try

764
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:51,000
and figure out what
in the heck it could be

765
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:53,333
and why we're receiving it.

766
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:55,791
All right, well,
let's-let's load up.

767
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:57,250
- All right.
- Okay.

768
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,958
What's going on, Erik?

769
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:08,667
- Well, I'm looking through some footage.
- Yeah?

770
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:10,667
Yeah, I've got something
to show you.

771
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:12,667
The day after
our night experiment

772
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,958
at Homestead Two, Erik called
us in to review something

773
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:16,500
in his surveillance footage

774
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:19,999
that got him both excited
and a little freaked out.

775
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:21,708
You know, we've got
all these new cameras out

776
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:23,708
at the homesteads,
so, you know,

777
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:26,542
I-I get plenty
of critter activity.

778
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,187
We have a lot deer,
we have a lot of...

779
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,875
At night, we have birds

780
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,500
and bats, especially.

781
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,333
But between all of that,

782
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:35,792
once in a while, we get some
things that just don't fit in.

783
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:38,542
You know? You know what it looks
like when you've got a,

784
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:41,708
you know, moth, or a, you know,
some kind of insect, or

785
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:44,083
a piece of debris flying
across your field of view.

786
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,750
But I've got something here
that doesn't fit in.

787
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,458
- Really?
- Yeah.

788
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:51,667
It happened just last night
after our experiment.

789
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:54,499
I'm gonna play this real time.

790
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:58,167
So, what camera are we looking
at specifically here?

791
00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:00,499
This is out
at the Carriage House.

792
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:02,833
Now, Car... That's the thing
across the road

793
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:04,666
- from Homestead Two, right?
- Yeah.

794
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,791
So, looking back toward
Homestead Two? It's that one?

795
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:08,624
- Yeah.
- Okay, so across the canal.

796
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:10,083
Yeah.

797
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:16,083
What on Earth is that?

798
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:18,791
What the hell is that?

799
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,583
Okay, so,
let's play this through,

800
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:23,708
and I really want your thoughts
on what this might be.

801
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:27,042
Oh, it's behind the tree,
so it's far enough away.

802
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,667
Right.

803
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:30,583
- Play that again.
- Sure.

804
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,291
You can see
the other particles around.

805
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:35,417
So, it's leaving a trail.

806
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:37,624
- Go back, Erik. Go back...
- Sure.

807
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:39,917
- About, um...
- Sure. Yeah, point out the trail.

808
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:41,624
Is that camera lag?

809
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:43,041
- It could be.
- Stop right there.

810
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:44,375
Uh-huh.

811
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,291
You can even see the trail
behind it.

812
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:46,917
Now let it... watch it go.

813
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:48,562
It leaves a trail
behind it as it goes.

814
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,750
- All right, stop. You see it?
- Sure.

815
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:55,124
You see it back there?

816
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:57,083
Now, what's the frame rate
of this camera?

817
00:35:57,208 --> 00:36:00,417
Um, these are set,
I believe, to 24. I...

818
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:03,375
- Well, that's not moving much faster than that.
- No.

819
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,792
So it shouldn't be causing
frame delay.

820
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,958
- I mean, there's frame rate...
- There's a black line

821
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,417
through the center
of this thing.

822
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:12,542
- Interesting.
- If you look,

823
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,999
there's a line going
right through the center of it.

824
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:17,042
And it's like this.

825
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,000
So, let it play
and see if it continues.

826
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:22,042
Okay. Yeah.

827
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:23,792
Yeah, it stays through it.

828
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,500
- Let it keep going.
- Okay.

829
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:31,917
So it's not a bug
inside the field of view

830
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:33,625
because it goes
behind this tree, right?

831
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,250
Well, it's not...
Look at the bugs, Travis.

832
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:37,541
- You can see the bugs zooming by.
- Yeah.

833
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:39,542
This thing looks like a balloon

834
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:42,167
- floating around on the wind.
- Yeah, and then it goes

835
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:44,417
behind the tree over here.

836
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:47,999
- Yeah, but the movement is ver...
- Yeah, that one.

837
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:49,541
...is very organic, I would say.

838
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,875
It's-it's irregular,
it's not even just

839
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,666
smoothly moving
through the scene.

840
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,583
Well, the interesting thing
is, you look at the grass

841
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,375
and the trees.

842
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,167
I don't see really
any wind, you know?

843
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:02,624
- Good point.
- And so you see it, it drifts over to the right with

844
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:05,250
no wind going that direction,
and then it drifts and

845
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,124
just slowly... Like I said,
it almost looks like

846
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,750
a balloon just floating around.

847
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:12,333
That's not being
affected by the same forces

848
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:14,333
that are
carrying the rest of it.

849
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:16,500
It's not a balloon,
because a balloon would have

850
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:20,083
been more stochastically,
nautically moving about.

851
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:25,542
And that looks like
it's moving with intent.

852
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,917
Comes along, decides
it doesn't want to be here,

853
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:29,625
and it decides to go off
this way.

854
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,083
This is unique.

855
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,416
- I...
- You know, and it's...

856
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,860
I don't think
I've seen anything...

857
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,499
You've never shown me
anything close to that.

858
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:37,708
Well, it goes in front
of those trees and behind

859
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:42,083
that tree, so that tells us
it's at least 30 feet away.

860
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:45,333
So it's about
the size of a volleyball.

861
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:48,292
Think of it this way.
In one night, one span there,

862
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:51,833
we see a strange
communication beam,

863
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,708
and then we see this thing.

864
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,750
Is there a connection?

865
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,958
What's particularly
bizarre about this phenomenon

866
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:07,999
is it happened just
after our rocket experiment

867
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,458
at Homestead Two

868
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:11,666
when we heard
that really strange

869
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,458
1.6 gigahertz signal.
It all looks to be connected.

870
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:17,208
I just don't know how
or why yet.

871
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:20,125
In the beginning,
it almost looks like it changes

872
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,417
shape a little bit to me.

873
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:23,166
Is it more, though, that,

874
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,333
looking at the end
would be a circle,

875
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:29,250
but then as it turns,
a cigar shape,

876
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,208
because you're
getting more of a 3D...

877
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,875
Just like this, right?
If you're looking at this

878
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:36,083
- end on, you think it's a circle, right?
- Sure.

879
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:38,875
If you look at it like this,
it's like a line or something,

880
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:40,333
you know, cigar-shaped.

881
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:42,333
I'll tell you
what it reminds me of.

882
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:45,292
The Tic Tac, the UAP video.

883
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:47,500
The UAP that appeared in

884
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,458
the Tic Tac video
that was recorded by

885
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:52,166
the USS Nimitz group in 2004

886
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,542
appeared to be cigar-shaped
when viewed from certain angles.

887
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,791
But it was reported to look more
spherical by the Navy pilots

888
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:00,667
when it flew
straight towards them.

889
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:04,375
Do any of those objects move
around so organically, like...

890
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,458
- As we see here?
- Yes, and they amorphously

891
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:09,667
change shape, depending
on the direction they turn.

892
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:13,624
So, we've measured a signal
many times when we've seen

893
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:18,499
phenomena occur specifically
around 1.6 gigahertz.

894
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:21,250
We're seeing whatever this
thing is,

895
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,124
and interestedly enough,

896
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:28,792
at the same instant, we see
this signal at 1.6 gigahertz.

897
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:30,417
It's pretty bizarre.

898
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,291
It's crazy is what it is.

899
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:35,167
I don't know what to say
of this,

900
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:39,208
but I would say you've captured
a UAP on camera here, Erik,

901
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:41,500
and we don't know what it is.

902
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:43,875
Well, this is just
one more case of

903
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,833
strange activity
out at the homesteads.

904
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,416
You know, Homestead Two is
a place where we see

905
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,250
a lot of this stuff.

906
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:51,208
So, I'm not going
to be satisfied

907
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:52,624
until I've spent some time doing

908
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:54,166
- some image processing on this.
- Sure.

909
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,291
And I'll come back
to you guys and

910
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:56,624
let you know if I find anything.

911
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:59,125
All right. Thanks, guys.
Good job, Erik.

912
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:03,917
Our fascination,
our speculation about the ranch

913
00:40:04,042 --> 00:40:06,458
phenomenon and about
how the ranch fits into

914
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:09,208
the larger picture has
only been elevated.

915
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,333
We realize we're
not dealing with a simple

916
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:14,042
problem set,
but one that is very complex.

917
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:17,333
All of this new data
that we have tells us there are

918
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,542
some really weird anomalies.

919
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:20,999
We don't know
what's causing that.

920
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:23,292
There's so much data.

921
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:25,833
What is the next
level of experimentation

922
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,958
that we need to do
to determine what this is?

923
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:31,791
You can't just go dig everywhere
under the ranch to find this.

924
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:34,833
We're gonna have to
find a better way to look deeper

925
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:37,167
under the surface to
figure out what's causing that.

926
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:39,958
The presence
of a signal or a frequency

927
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:42,833
that seems to attend
the events and the activities

928
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:45,875
on the property may be
our greatest discovery yet.

929
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,583
I had always hoped
that these activities would lead

930
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:52,417
to our ability
to hopefully communicate

931
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:56,167
with the entities
involved with the ranch.

932
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:59,000
Now, I believe
what we may be seeing is

933
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,875
communication back to us

934
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,124
in ways that we had
not anticipated

935
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,792
here at Skinwalker Ranch.

936
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:10,750
It looks like
something's collapsed here.

937
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,750
That tells me
that was done to hide something.

938
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:17,042
There was an area
I found on this mesa slope,

939
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:18,750
and it lead to this open cave.

940
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,583
I'm pretty sure this is it.

941
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:23,417
What were they hiding
in that mesa?

942
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:27,042
Popping smoke. Look, look,
it's getting sucked in.

943
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:29,542
You guys really
stirred the old hornet's nest.

944
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:32,124
- Look, they're movin'.
- I've never seen this many

945
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:33,458
mysterious lights in the sky.
