1
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:41,795
perimeter has been breached.

2
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,335
Dismissed.

3
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:49,136
Yes, security has been

4
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,206
breached too soldier.

5
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,262
alright, you two stay here

6
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,497
and guard the door.

7
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:40,988
That's it?

8
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,423
This is enough?

9
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:45,759
Trust me, it's plenty.

10
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:46,494
Don't we need protective

11
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:47,561
suits?

12
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:49,330
Not if you're careful.

13
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:52,533
Faddem, take this,

14
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,001
give this to shalik.

15
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,438
Momad, grab the other one.

16
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,812
No!

17
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:06,280
No!

18
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:07,381
Please open the door!

19
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:08,048
Open the door!

20
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:08,949
Let him out!

21
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,017
Let him out now!

22
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:10,918
He's dead!

23
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:14,522
He's dead!

24
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:20,828
You can't do anything for him.

25
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,664
It's a pretty mean shit huh?

26
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,466
He's my friend.

27
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:30,438
No, he was your friend.

28
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:32,306
That guy should have

29
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,874
worn a suit.

30
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,715
get a grip Aladdin.

31
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:44,518
His name is faddem.

32
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:45,519
It's gonna be mud if he's as

33
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,087
clumsy as your buddy.

34
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,391
Let's go!

35
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:51,525
Faddem, please be

36
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,827
very careful.

37
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,497
Let's go!

38
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:22,590

39
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,149
69, 45.

40
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:29,817
Hut!

41
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,117
Hut!

42
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,451
Hut!

43
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,683
Oh, baby!

44
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:36,584
Me, I love you baby.

45
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,786
I love you!

46
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:39,787
Alright guys, settle down,

47
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,921
settle down.

48
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:41,855
Listen up!

49
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:42,723
Williams.

50
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:43,657
Williams!

51
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,259
Go short!

52
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,801
You're up slater, go deep.

53
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,619
Geez!

54
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,260
How ya doin'?

55
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,261
Mmm..

56
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,362
It's been better.

57
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,096
Maybe you should try

58
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,598
ankle weights.

59
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:25,098
Why don't you try

60
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,934
a catcher's mit?

61
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,036
Oh, thanks!

62
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:29,903
Slater!

63
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,339
You dickhead!

64
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,273
You couldn't catch flies if

65
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,375
you're covered in dog shit!

66
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,243
Hey first man, you couldn't

67
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,077
hit water even if you're in

68
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,779
the middle of the ocean.

69
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:39,379
If you get your fingers on

70
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,113
the ball you might be able

71
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,081
to catch it.

72
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:41,749
Wait a sec, you're

73
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:42,315
the quarterback.

74
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:42,916
You're supposed to throw

75
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,784
the ball to me not a mile

76
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,318
over my head.

77
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,019
I threw it where you're

78
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,120
supposed to be.

79
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:47,688
Alright, you're right,

80
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:48,255
you're right, I'm sorry.

81
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,122
I didn't know that I was

82
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:49,589
supposed to be

83
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:50,724
in the next state.

84
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:52,325
You little pussy!

85
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:53,794
Don't throw your arm out

86
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:54,862
we need you man!

87
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:55,663
The only thing that I'm gonna

88
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:56,329
be throwing out is you!

89
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:56,997
I've seen you throw,

90
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,165
it's not so much of a threat.

91
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:01,068
You son of a--

92
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:02,335
get off!

93
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,904
Come on man, let it go!

94
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:04,738
Alright bring it on Bruce,

95
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:05,272
come on!

96
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,774
Alright!

97
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:09,242
Time's up boys.

98
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,178
Everybody hit the showers.

99
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:15,849
You got lucky

100
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,285
you little prick.

101
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,187
I'll catch up to you later.

102
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,323
It's a date then.

103
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,327
A great way to start my day.

104
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,852
Hey Jenny, wait up, wait up.

105
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:26,286
Got a minute?

106
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,120
No.

107
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,221
Late for physics.

108
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,022
Slow down, slow down.

109
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,223
I'll walk you.

110
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:31,424
Walk me?

111
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:32,993
Thanks, but I'm not

112
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,361
a doberman.

113
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,128
Oh really?

114
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:36,897
Okay, what's up?

115
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,465
Alright.

116
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,099
Okay, here's the deal.

117
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,300
Look, I was wondering if you

118
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,769
have a date for the homecoming

119
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,271
dance?

120
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:44,805
Why?

121
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,006
Are you taking a poll?

122
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:46,974
Ouch!

123
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,042
Gosh, you're not a doberman?

124
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:53,480
Okay, okay, I deserve that,

125
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:54,247
but before you say

126
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:54,915
anything else...

127
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,116
You should know that I a have

128
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,251
rule about dating jocks...

129
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:58,886
That's okay.

130
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,153
So do I.

131
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:01,521
I'm serious.

132
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,923
Me too...

133
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:03,957
I'll tell you what...

134
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:04,825
I'll take a chance that I'll

135
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,226
break my rule,

136
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,094
if you break yours.

137
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,195
Ooh, sorry I'm a compulsive

138
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,898
rule follower.

139
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:11,899
That could be a problem,

140
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:12,800
but...

141
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,500
You know technically...

142
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,836
You know I'm not really a jock.

143
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,404
I know, I've seen you play.

144
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:18,238
Ouch!

145
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:19,973
Wait a second,

146
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,508
you are a jock.

147
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,010
No, no, no, no, no...

148
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,978
I'm a physics major.

149
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:25,612
Ah!

150
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:26,279
That athletic scholarship is

151
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:27,380
the only way I could afford to

152
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,183
come here, but because I'm not

153
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,919
a boy and a football player,

154
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:32,519
it only pays for half

155
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,354
of my tuition.

156
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:35,355
So...

157
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,257
In between classes, track

158
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,292
practice, and my part time

159
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,560
job...

160
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,361
I don't have much time

161
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,331
for social life.

162
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,336
Ooh besides...

163
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,170
I think you already

164
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,906
have a date.

165
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,909
Hey, there he is.

166
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:56,409
Hey what do you say?

167
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:56,944
Yes?

168
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:57,477
No?

169
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,946
Yes... yes... yes...?

170
00:12:58,979 --> 00:12:59,512
Slater!

171
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:00,313
You faggot!

172
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:01,214
You stay right there.

173
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,349
Ooh...

174
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:02,983
I don't know...

175
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,885
Let me think for a minute...

176
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:08,555
Ooh, maybe...Let me think...

177
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:09,456
I...I'll get back to you.

178
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,057
Uhh...

179
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:20,994
Alright, we'll go around

180
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:21,628
and find him.

181
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:22,362
He's around here somewhere,

182
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,130
I know it.

183
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,331
He can't be far, man.

184
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,165
Single file people.

185
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,634
Single file.

186
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,504
Okay people let's go.

187
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,372
We'll attendance on the bus.

188
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,574
Come on.

189
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:42,983
I told you I'd get

190
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,084
back to you.

191
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,485
I'm impressed,

192
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,254
you're not dead.

193
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:48,388
Are you impressed enough

194
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,157
to go out with me?

195
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,625
You would have to cure cancer

196
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,493
and win a pulitzer for me

197
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:56,063
to be that impressed.

198
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:56,563
Man!

199
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,065
You're a tough room.

200
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:58,631
Alright, so...

201
00:14:58,665 --> 00:14:59,466
Where are we going?

202
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,201
We're going to the water

203
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,535
and power plant.

204
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,136
You see it's not where I've

205
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:03,803
chosen to take you on our

206
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,338
first date, but it could work,

207
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,074
it could work.

208
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,144
You're impossible.

209
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:20,120
Slater, you're in my seat.

210
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,556
Mcguiness, take a seat.

211
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,092
He's in my seat.

212
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,027
There are plenty of others,

213
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,627
just pick one,

214
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,297
so we can get going.

215
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,238
Are you in this class?

216
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,973
No he's not.

217
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:40,573
Yes, I am...

218
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,241
You see...

219
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:41,908
I was thinking about you know,

220
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,177
declaring physics as my major

221
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,245
and so the department told me

222
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,179
I was allowed to sit on your

223
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:47,180
class because they said your

224
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:50,183
class was the best.

225
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,153
I see.

226
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,059
What luck huh?

227
00:15:59,092 --> 00:15:59,626
It looks like it's about to

228
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:00,593
run out.

229
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:01,561
Excuse me, excuse me...

230
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:02,996
Me and my date are trying to

231
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,131
have a private conversation,

232
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,532
okay?

233
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:07,600
Mr. McGuinness,

234
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,501
could we at least

235
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,070
try to act our age?

236
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,405
Please.

237
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:25,718
good morning gentleman,

238
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:26,586
how can I help you?

239
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,055
Hey, hey, wait, hold on!

240
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,259
Who are you?

241
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:07,560
What do you want?

242
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:11,298
Shut up!

243
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:11,798
You got a public address

244
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,333
system here right?

245
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,102
Yes, of course.

246
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:15,768
Good!

247
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,805
Get on it, gather everyone up.

248
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:20,607
You got a hearing problem?

249
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,342
I know I'm talking cause I

250
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,212
recognize my voice.

251
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,746
You uh...

252
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,648
You dont understand.

253
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:31,351
I can't just have everybody

254
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,286
abandon their stations.

255
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,187
We have systems here that have

256
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,523
to be monitored constantly.

257
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,257
No, it's you that doesn't

258
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:37,890
understand.

259
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,226
If you don't do what I say,

260
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,627
this lovely young lady right

261
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,661
here is gonna blow your brains

262
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,496
all over that wall.

263
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,501
Now, I know you heard me

264
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,503
that time didn't you?

265
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:51,438
Yeah.

266
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,506
Yeah, I heard you.

267
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,175
I'll do anything you say.

268
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,779
I know you will.

269
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,583
Attention all plant employees,

270
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,153
attention all plant employees,

271
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,254
please stop what you are

272
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,655
doing immediately and

273
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:11,458
report to section c.

274
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,693
This is an emergency.

275
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:21,334
Repeat, this is an emergency.

276
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:22,569
All personnel, please report

277
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,438
to section c immediately.

278
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:29,242
They can't mean us.

279
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:34,347
Todos los empleados...

280
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:43,823
you think they mean us?

281
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,192
He said everybody.

282
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,166
Hello?

283
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,401
Hello?

284
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,802
Damn phone...

285
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:56,469
Hey, why don't you...

286
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:57,136
Uhm...

287
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:57,804
You go downstairs and find out

288
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:58,371
what's going on and I'll take

289
00:18:58,405 --> 00:18:59,772
care of things up here.

290
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:00,139
I can...

291
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:00,907
I can do it.

292
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,741
You sure?

293
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:02,709
Go...

294
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,477
Go!

295
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,345
Everyone,

296
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:41,381
please settle down.

297
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,985
Silencio por favor!

298
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,787
I'll tell you.

299
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,888
Just a second, as soon

300
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,291
as everyone is settles.

301
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:51,758
Tell us.

302
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:52,592
Yeah, spit it out.

303
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,393
That's right.

304
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:14,481
thank you.

305
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:15,382
Now, I suggest everyone

306
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:17,984
sit down and be quiet.

307
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:36,836
good morning.

308
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:37,804
Good morning, plant director

309
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,739
ramos is expecting us.

310
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:40,473
I'm sorry, the plant is

311
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,542
closed for the day.

312
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,676
Closed?

313
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,345
Look, can you please check

314
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,046
your clipboard?

315
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:47,680
We're from richfield

316
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:48,948
university.

317
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:49,782
Sorry, there are no

318
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:53,019
civilians allowed.

319
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:56,956
Come on Jenny,

320
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,291
I asked you first.

321
00:20:58,325 --> 00:20:59,025
He did?

322
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,760
Yeah, that's right.

323
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:01,628
I'm faster than you on

324
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:02,795
and off the field.

325
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:03,763
I wouldn't brag out about

326
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,332
your premature problem,

327
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:06,766
if I was you.

328
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,401
Screw you slater.

329
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:10,102
I think you're both being

330
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,472
a little premature here.

331
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:13,640
I haven't agreed to go with

332
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,308
the dance to either

333
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:16,676
one of you.

334
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:17,944
I understand, I understand.

335
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:18,845
You need time to let

336
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,347
Bruce down gently.

337
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,381
Screw you, slater.

338
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:23,082
You need a new catchphrase.

339
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:23,850
I'm sorry the plant is

340
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,718
closed for today.

341
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:26,353
And I'm not leaving until

342
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:29,956
I speak with director ramos.

343
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,024
Wait here, please.

344
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:35,061
We must not be on the a-list.

345
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,400
Hey, check that out!

346
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:45,572
Check what out loser?

347
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:48,708
It looked like an ak-47.

348
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,343
How will you know?

349
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:51,778
My dad's a New York cop.

350
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,579
Oh, so it makes you a gun

351
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:53,346
expert?

352
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:53,880
No.

353
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:54,347
It's...I've done some

354
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:57,817
shooting, alright?

355
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:58,951
Aren't assault rifles

356
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,887
illegal?

357
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,796
Yes?

358
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:13,933
What?

359
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,835
Look, tell them we have a

360
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:17,937
broken steam valve.

361
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,439
What's going on?

362
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:20,139
There's a bus load of college

363
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,109
students at the front gate.

364
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:25,478
Give me that.

365
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,413
Speak!

366
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:27,480
There is a certain professor

367
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,648
Harris here who insists on

368
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,849
speaking to the plant

369
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,083
director.

370
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:33,753
Alright, put him on.

371
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:34,754
Professor Harris is a woman.

372
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:38,591
A very pushy woman.

373
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,761
Hello, Mr. Ramos?

374
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,663
Yes, professor Harris?

375
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,432
How can I help you?

376
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:46,098
I arranged this trip with

377
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:47,834
your regional manager--

378
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:48,401
uh huh...

379
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:49,135
Over a month ago and he

380
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:49,802
assured me...

381
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:50,369
Uh huh...

382
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:51,103
That we'll be given your

383
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:51,704
full cooperation--

384
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,573
yes, I see.

385
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,643
Okay.

386
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:57,644
Hello, Mr. Ramos?

387
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:58,445
Could you put the guard back

388
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:00,613
on the line please?

389
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:02,549
Thank you.

390
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:08,888
Let them in, direct them to

391
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,723
section c.

392
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:13,025
Very good.

393
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:17,830
Are you crazy?

394
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:18,631
What do we need more

395
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:21,468
hostages for?

396
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:22,769
Well, number 1, until our

397
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:23,970
plan is in full motion,

398
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,137
I do not want to do anything

399
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:26,906
to arouse any suspicions,

400
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:30,910
and number 2, the younger

401
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,512
the hostages are the less

402
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:33,513
likely it will be that the

403
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:34,881
authorities will try

404
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:38,117
anything stupid.

405
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,051
It's bad p.R.

406
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,688
For the u.S government to be

407
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:42,555
gunning down innocent

408
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:47,226
college kids.

409
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:51,964
It's beautiful!

410
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:07,480
did you see that?

411
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:08,214
There's a body hidden behind

412
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,249
those trash cans.

413
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,685
Maybe it's just Jimmy hoffa.

414
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:13,285
Who?

415
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:13,786
Come on, you're telling me

416
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,955
you didn't see him?

417
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,535
okay people...

418
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:29,669
I don't need to remind you to

419
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:30,603
conduct yourselves in an

420
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:34,006
orderly fashion, do I?

421
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,507
Excuse me,

422
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,041
professor Harris...

423
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:35,642
Yes?

424
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:36,576
Look, I'm not sure how to

425
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:37,877
tell you this but...

426
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,845
Alright, here it is,

427
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:39,979
look, I...

428
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:40,613
I'm sure I saw a guy lying

429
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:41,681
behind the garbage cans out

430
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,516
there and he looked..

431
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,084
He looks sort of dead.

432
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,085
You saw a body?

433
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,019
That's right, only in his

434
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:49,556
underwear.

435
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:50,523
In his underwear?

436
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:51,123
That's right, that's right.

437
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:51,791
And you know the security

438
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:52,458
guard, you know, I saw he had

439
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,927
an ak-47 in that little room.

440
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,929
Aha, an ak-47 assault rifle?

441
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,931
That's right, that's right...

442
00:24:58,965 --> 00:24:59,832
What is your name again?

443
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:01,100
Slater, Lenny slater...

444
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:02,101
Slater...

445
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,770
Lenny slater!

446
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:06,105
Aren't you the young

447
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:07,039
practical joker who parked

448
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:08,541
coach asheville's new Cadillac

449
00:25:08,575 --> 00:25:09,075
in the middle of the

450
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,209
gymnasium?

451
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,044
That wasn't me okay, I swear.

452
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:13,145
That's right!

453
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,213
They couldn't a thing even

454
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,147
though everyone

455
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,783
knew he did it.

456
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:17,850
Look Mr. Slater, I don't know

457
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:19,285
quite what you are up to here,

458
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:20,119
but I can assure you, you' are

459
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,788
not gonna disrupt my class

460
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:22,989
with your juvenile attempts

461
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,090
at witticism.

462
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:25,257
Look, I just think we

463
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:25,958
should--

464
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:26,626
young man...

465
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:27,193
I'm gonna ask you to remain on

466
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,260
the bus while we conduct

467
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:29,629
our tour.

468
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:31,163
You can take your seat now.

469
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:31,764
But wait a sec--

470
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:35,534
thank you!

471
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:41,841
You're such a loser slater.

472
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:42,775
I'm the one who parked coach's

473
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,811
car in the gym.

474
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,280
So where are your famous

475
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:50,717
comebacks now, smartass!

476
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,219
Alright people, let's go!

477
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,213
The students have left

478
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,148
the bus and are heading

479
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,783
into the plant.

480
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:24,350
Good.

481
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,017
Keep your eye on 'em.

482
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:27,153
Carver out.

483
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:37,930
Okay, let's go!

484
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:40,800
This is it!

485
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,268
Are you prepared?

486
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:43,035
I've been waiting for this

487
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,971
my whole life!

488
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:45,571
And I thought you've been

489
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,773
waiting for me your whole

490
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:47,840
life...

491
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:50,843
Alright if anyone tries

492
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:55,414
anything, kill them.

493
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,318
It would be my pleasure.

494
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:13,933
hey, what exactly does

495
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,035
Mean?

496
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:17,136
The literal translation is

497
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:18,771
pig, but it is actually

498
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,106
something far more

499
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,774
unflattering than that.

500
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,242
She's quite a gal.

501
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:24,210
Where did you find her?

502
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:25,377
She's my sister.

503
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:26,913
Oh...

504
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:27,446
I should have noticed the

505
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,815
family resemblance.

506
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:29,415
You both have the same machine

507
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,884
guns, but she's got that

508
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:34,453
extra pair of 38's.

509
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,823
Hey!

510
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:37,857
Don't get any funny ideas

511
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,025
yankee!

512
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:39,625
She will kill you in an

513
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:43,295
instant if I tell her to.

514
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,396
Relax, mo, ol' buddy,

515
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,733
I didn't mean to disrespect.

516
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:47,900
Hell, if my sister looked that

517
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:48,768
good I'd keep her heavily

518
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:49,869
armed too.

519
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:51,938
You know what I mean?

520
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:54,240
The name's momad.

521
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:57,777
Faddem, Abdul, Aziz...

522
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,446
Let's get to work!

523
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:34,413
You trust me?

524
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:38,284
I'd better.

525
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:46,959
Alright...

526
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:01,507
all we have to do is take this

527
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,809
little bit back to your

528
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:06,078
country and add water and we

529
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:08,881
can make as much as we want.

530
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:10,449
It's that concentrated?

531
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,183
That's the beauty of this

532
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:12,952
stuff.

533
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:13,986
There's some special compound

534
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,287
strain, multiplies itself

535
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:17,189
in water.

536
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:18,190
Once we drop this into the

537
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:21,093
reservior, this whole place

538
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:23,129
will be one big nerve gas

539
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:25,231
oasis.

540
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,365
Pumping death through the

541
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:27,967
water taps to everyone

542
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,802
in the city.

543
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:31,503
Is there an antidote?

544
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:32,872
Not once you've been

545
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:33,906
infected.

546
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,540
That's why the compound was

547
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:35,507
rigged with a self-destruct

548
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:38,377
firebomb.

549
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:51,991
alright.

550
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:29,195
And here is where the energy

551
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:30,529
from the fossil fuel is

552
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,031
converted into alternating

553
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:34,100
electrical currents.

554
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:35,367
In these generators is where

555
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:36,869
the electromagnetic conduction

556
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:40,472
occurs.

557
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:43,175
Step this way please.

558
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:45,044
We will be visiting the

559
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:45,711
reclamation pits next and I

560
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:47,046
want to remind you to all stay

561
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,414
close together.

562
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:50,016
This facility is a huge maze,

563
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:50,649
and you can find yourself

564
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,219
easily lost in its tunnels.

565
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,487
What is it now, Bruce?

566
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:56,122
I don't get it, why won't

567
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,189
you come to homecoming dance

568
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:57,957
with me?

569
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,125
I told you, I'm busy.

570
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:00,993
Yeah, yeah, I know...

571
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:01,961
Your jobs, midterms...

572
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:03,562
Yada, yada, yada.

573
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,097
Oh well, not everybody can

574
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:06,365
skate through on a full

575
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:08,100
scholarship.

576
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:09,635
Yeah, I know...

577
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:12,504
So are we going to the dance

578
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,506
or what?

579
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:16,075
I don't get you guys.

580
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:18,177
What part of no don't you

581
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,346
understand?

582
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,081
I know that no usually means

583
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:23,549
maybe and maybe usually

584
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,217
means yes.

585
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:25,851
Ahh...

586
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,054
Okay so, you think I'm just

587
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:30,156
playing hard to get?

588
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:31,357
I think your mind is telling

589
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,960
you one thing and your body is

590
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:35,427
telling you something else.

591
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:37,229
Well, uh...

592
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:38,597
Why don't you listen real

593
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,966
closely to what my body

594
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:43,302
is saying now...

595
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:47,106
Ugh!

596
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:48,440
Oh great, which way did they

597
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:52,211
go?

598
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,313
The electricity produced from

599
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,447
the generators then goes

600
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,516
through these...

601
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:00,252
Oh, excuse me.

602
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:01,287
Everyone into the pit!

603
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,188
Wai-- wait, just...

604
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:03,555
Just a minute.

605
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:09,095
Do it now!

606
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:12,098
What was that?

607
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:15,034
What?

608
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:18,270
It sounded like gunshots.

609
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:21,707
Gunshots?

610
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:29,181
The explosive will not

611
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:31,250
destroy the virus?

612
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:35,321
It's a concussion grenade,

613
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:36,288
no flame, just smoke and

614
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:38,557
shrapnel, enough to punch a

615
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,658
hole in the case and send it

616
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:40,559
to the bottom of the

617
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,694
reservoir.

618
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:44,430
Perfect!

619
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:54,706
Faddem, I want you and Aziz

620
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,108
to plant the rest of t he

621
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,244
charges, set the timer

622
00:32:58,277 --> 00:33:00,479
for 5 hours.

623
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:20,166
This must be it.

624
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:24,736
Alpha 1 to hq, come in.

625
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,339
Go ahead Alpha 1.

626
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:28,740
Found a vehicle...

627
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:29,408
Uh...

628
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,677
It's by a gravel pit just off

629
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,046
highway 45, maybe 10 miles

630
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,447
north of route 22.

631
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,449
Let's get an investigation

632
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:39,118
unit out here, asap.

633
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:40,786
Affirmative Alpha 1.

634
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:41,753
Oh, and colonel...

635
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:43,155
Yeah?

636
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:44,623
The Pentagon suspects a

637
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:45,791
collaborator, they're sending

638
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,626
an FBI profiler to go over

639
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,728
our personnel files.

640
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:50,829
That figures.

641
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,132
Alright, uh...

642
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:54,700
Stall 'em as long as you can.

643
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:55,767
Yes sir.

644
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:57,703
Over and out.

645
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,348
let's get this show

646
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,151
on the road, huh?

647
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,619
Right now!

648
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:19,291
Hi, I have information about

649
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:21,827
the explosion at fort Solomon,

650
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,095
put me through the

651
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:24,696
investigating officer please.

652
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,198
Geswald, get away from there!

653
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,713
son of a bitch!

654
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,420
What?

655
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,222
Catch you in a bad time?

656
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:24,590
Who is this?

657
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,359
Take a wild guess.

658
00:35:27,393 --> 00:35:29,461
I don't have time for games.

659
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:30,462
Think...

660
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:35,367
Persian Gulf, February 1991.

661
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:38,904
Sergeant Max carver.

662
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:40,206
I was hoping g2 would make

663
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,174
you the pointman on this

664
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,742
little mission.

665
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,844
It's been a long time colonel.

666
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,813
Not long enough.

667
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:48,480
I figured you went up

668
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:50,449
with the compound last night.

669
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,620
Wishful thinking, huh?

670
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,755
So sorry to disappoint you.

671
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,857
Cut the crap carver.

672
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,626
Have you got the goods or not?

673
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,561
Well...

674
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:05,664
First things first colonel,

675
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:06,698
you should know I'm calling

676
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:08,700
on behalf of the Iraqi

677
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:10,402
nationalist regime.

678
00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:11,637
The inr?

679
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,772
It was disbanded 2 years ago.

680
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:17,776
We are a splinter group.

681
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,711
We?

682
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:21,213
You know, treason is still a

683
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:23,549
capital offense sergeant.

684
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:24,483
Well, you're the expert on

685
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:28,454
betrayal, colonel.

686
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:29,921
Do you wanna hear our demands?

687
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:30,956
Or do I have to do something

688
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,325
nasty?

689
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,226
Alright, say what you

690
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,594
have to say.

691
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:37,396
We are in control of the

692
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,565
richfield water and power

693
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:41,533
plant...

694
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:42,200
Unless kalmed farrukh is

695
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:43,835
released immediately, we will

696
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,637
drop the vx solution into

697
00:36:45,671 --> 00:36:49,007
the city's water supply.

698
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,541
I don't even know where

699
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:52,611
farrukh's being held.

700
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:55,714
Don't insult me colonel,

701
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,416
okay?

702
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:00,419
Don't insult me.

703
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:01,253
You think it's a coincidence

704
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:03,755
we picked richfield?

705
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:04,790
Alright, I'm gonna need some

706
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:08,594
time.

707
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:09,495
You got 4 hours to deliver

708
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:11,630
him to the gates of the plant.

709
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:12,764
4 hours?

710
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:13,899
Are you insane carver?

711
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:14,900
No...

712
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:16,768
No, just incredibly

713
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:20,839
happy-go-lucky...

714
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:21,940
Oh, and in case

715
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,276
you're thinking of storming

716
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:27,012
the facility, just bear in

717
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:28,514
mind we have all the employees

718
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:30,316
hostage as well as a group of

719
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:32,318
local college students on a

720
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:38,524
Really unfortunate

721
00:37:38,557 --> 00:37:39,991
field trip.

722
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:40,659
You know what kinda red tape

723
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:41,259
I'm gonna have to cut through

724
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:42,928
to get a federal prisoner

725
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:43,462
released from a maximum

726
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:46,398
security penitentiary.

727
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:47,599
Well, that sounds like a

728
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,735
personal problem to me.

729
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:50,902
Hey!

730
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,439
It was nice talking to ya!

731
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:55,541
Have a nice day colonel!

732
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:56,875
Carver?

733
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:59,378
Carver!

734
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:01,012
Son of a bitch!

735
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:04,850
What did he say?

736
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:06,017
Well, you know, the usual.

737
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:07,353
Don't be a stranger...

738
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:08,654
Let's do lunch...

739
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:09,521
I'll have my people

740
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:11,657
call your people.

741
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,795
let's go!

742
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:30,241
are you sure you know

743
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:31,510
where we're going Bruce?

744
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:33,379
Uh-huh!

745
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:40,952
Uh-- let's ask those guys.

746
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,456
Max, will they comply

747
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,692
with our demands?

748
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:49,828
Maybe, maybe not.

749
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:50,362
But then again, it doesn't

750
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:53,699
really matter does it?

751
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:13,719
Those guys had guns.

752
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:16,087
Shit!

753
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,623
We better find the others.

754
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:18,089
Yeah.

755
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:20,125
I'm all over that.

756
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:23,128
Oh, shit man!

757
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:25,831
I heard something,

758
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,666
go check it out.

759
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:31,403
one of them had

760
00:39:31,437 --> 00:39:32,471
on army fatigues.

761
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:33,439
He's not the only one.

762
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:34,105
So what?

763
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:34,606
There's gotta be some logical

764
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,741
reason for all this.

765
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:36,542
Yeah, terrorists took

766
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:37,609
over the plant.

767
00:39:37,643 --> 00:39:38,610
Bullshit!

768
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:40,045
Wait, Lenny, this isn't some

769
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:41,547
kind of a lab work practical

770
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,481
joke, is it?

771
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:44,115
I wish it was.

772
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:44,750
Ugh, get off it slater.

773
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:45,617
What are terrorist doing in

774
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:46,017
richfield?

775
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,519
Oh, shit!

776
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:51,757
You are tripping dude!

777
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,658
Hey!

778
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:53,058
Yo!

779
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:53,925
Excuse me?

780
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,799
Oh god, don't shoot!

781
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:02,768
Don't shoot!

782
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,007
Hi.

783
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:12,478
just chill out dude.

784
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:13,044
I'm just trying to find

785
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,046
my buds.

786
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:20,752
How many more of your buds

787
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:24,122
are around here junior?

788
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,792
Look around.

789
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,531
Let's go.

790
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:05,196
They've escaped at the

791
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:05,831
elevator to the upper

792
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:06,998
catwalks.

793
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:08,567
Find them, don't let them

794
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,971
get away.

795
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:14,640
Hi honey, I'm home.

796
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:18,043
You missed me?

797
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,986
Just go sit down.

798
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:31,990
McGuinness,

799
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:33,058
you're all right.

800
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:34,225
What's going on here?

801
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:36,895
They won't tell us.

802
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:40,966
Faddem, Aziz,

803
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,701
where are you?

804
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,103
We are in section a.

805
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:46,972
Almost done.

806
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,206
Assist shalik in the

807
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,040
generator room, there are

808
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:51,242
some stray hostages.

809
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:55,013
We are on our way.

810
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,318
professor, you were told

811
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,988
to sit down!

812
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,929
see if Williams is free.

813
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:36,187
Colonel gentry,

814
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:36,988
I'm special agent Diana woods

815
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:38,657
with the FBI.

816
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,290
I've been assigned to advise

817
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:41,292
you in behalf of the bureau.

818
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:42,360
Yeah, well...

819
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,629
Sorry you took the ride all

820
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:45,997
the way out here for nothing.

821
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:46,898
Uh, we're dealing with a

822
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:48,867
stolen substance that is way

823
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,368
above your security clearance.

824
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,637
I've already been thoroughly

825
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,205
briefed on the vx 1249 as well

826
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,240
as the compound personnel

827
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:57,809
and I've narrowed your

828
00:42:57,843 --> 00:42:58,610
collaborator down to 3

829
00:42:58,644 --> 00:42:59,711
possibilities.

830
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:01,212
Sergeant Ben mottley,

831
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:03,214
corporal Nathan hower,

832
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:04,182
and sergeant Max--

833
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:06,685
carver.

834
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:09,220
You sound certain.

835
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,321
He called me.

836
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:12,157
How'd you pick him up?

837
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,025
I'm a trained psychologist.

838
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:15,160
I graduated in the top 10%

839
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:16,294
of my class.

840
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:17,395
I've got 8 years

841
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,764
psychoanalytical field

842
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,265
experience.

843
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:21,900
Well, you might be of some

844
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:25,671
use to me after all.

845
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:26,271
Where are we going?

846
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:28,206
Richfield power and water.

847
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,140
Does your field experience

848
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:29,941
include any hostage

849
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:31,242
negotiation?

850
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,178
No, sir...

851
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:34,646
Not really.

852
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,382
It does now.

853
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:41,953
Well?

854
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:42,854
This is a bureau car.

855
00:43:42,888 --> 00:43:44,690
That really makes me the one

856
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:46,925
who should drive--

857
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:37,743
This way!

858
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:47,318
shali!

859
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:02,200
Go this way.

860
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:02,734
I'll cut them off

861
00:45:02,768 --> 00:45:04,235
in the next stairway.

862
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:23,288
Wait here.

863
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,084
You killed him!

864
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:53,819
What'd you expect?

865
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:54,986
It's him or us.

866
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,568
So, how did you get mixed up

867
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,436
in this whole terrorism thing

868
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:13,404
anyway...

869
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,006
I mean, I know it's all...

870
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,408
You know, family deal, but--

871
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:21,512
momad, come in.

872
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:24,883
Come in momad.

873
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:25,516
Yes?

874
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:26,051
Faddem, have you taken care

875
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:28,153
of the stray hostages?

876
00:46:28,186 --> 00:46:29,487
They are not hostages.

877
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,522
They must be enemy agents,

878
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:33,191
but they have killed shalik

879
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:33,892
and Aziz.

880
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:35,894
Find them.

881
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:36,995
Do whatever you must,

882
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:38,096
but I want them dead,

883
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:38,964
do you understand?

884
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:40,198
Yes, my leader.

885
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:42,868
You can count on me.

886
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:43,401
You want me to take care

887
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:43,869
of them?

888
00:46:43,902 --> 00:46:44,569
No.

889
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:47,138
I want you here.

890
00:46:49,107 --> 00:46:53,444
So do I.

891
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:19,938
Yes?

892
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:21,139
Very well.

893
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:21,772
There are some enemy agents

894
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:24,242
inside the compound already.

895
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:25,243
Leave the guard shack and

896
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:27,378
assist faddem in finding them.

897
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:45,563
Abdul, come in.

898
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:46,431
Yes, momad?

899
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:48,299
Status report.

900
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:48,967
The enemy is moving into

901
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,068
position around the perimeter

902
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:52,437
just as you said.

903
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:53,104
Yes, I know.

904
00:47:53,138 --> 00:47:54,139
Keep your eyes there are some

905
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:55,573
infiltrators inside

906
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:57,976
the facility already.

907
00:47:58,009 --> 00:47:58,576
It is done.

908
00:47:58,609 --> 00:47:59,377
I will guard our objective

909
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,012
with my life.

910
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:04,515
Very well, go with god.

911
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:24,169
all your calls are being

912
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:24,669
routed through the

913
00:48:24,702 --> 00:48:26,271
communications Van.

914
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:26,804
Have we made contact

915
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:29,140
with the penitentiary?

916
00:48:29,174 --> 00:48:29,707
I think we should discuss

917
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,377
that colonel.

918
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,111
Woods, I thought you were

919
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:34,946
here to assist me?

920
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,613
You're not seriously

921
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:36,447
considering answering

922
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:38,449
their demands?

923
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:39,084
Do you have any idea what

924
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:40,218
would happen if they release

925
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,319
that compound into the water

926
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:42,687
supply?

927
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,189
I...

928
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:45,957
I have a fair idea.

929
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:48,293
Fair idea!

930
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:48,960
Regardless...

931
00:48:48,994 --> 00:48:49,627
That...

932
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,528
That doesn't mean we suddenly

933
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:53,164
start ignoring national policy

934
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:53,831
on terrorists.

935
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,700
Don't be so naive agent woods.

936
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:56,667
We ignore policies

937
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:58,136
all the time.

938
00:48:58,169 --> 00:48:58,736
Didn't they teach you anything

939
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,538
about fishing at the FBI?

940
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:02,240
Fishing?

941
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:03,374
In order to catch the big

942
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:04,109
ones, you gotta have

943
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:06,244
the right bait.

944
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,545
Hop to it soldier and get me

945
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:09,514
the warden asap.

946
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:27,232
Hey you!

947
00:49:27,265 --> 00:49:27,765
You!

948
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:28,433
Hey!

949
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:29,200
Over here!

950
00:49:29,234 --> 00:49:30,101
Hey!

951
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:31,302
Shit!

952
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:32,270
Oh, they can't hear us.

953
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:41,346
What the hell was that?

954
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:43,648
Oh god, the hostages.

955
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,822
Ceasefire!

956
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,692
Hold your fire!

957
00:50:29,327 --> 00:50:30,628
Who's in charge of those guys

958
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:31,429
who went over there and those

959
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:32,029
agents?

960
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,530
I want to see all of your

961
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:33,064
commanding officers

962
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:34,365
right here, right now!

963
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:37,468
On the double!

964
00:50:55,153 --> 00:50:58,156
Hello?

965
00:50:58,189 --> 00:50:58,723
What the hell is going out

966
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,258
there, gentry?

967
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,159
How the hell should I know.

968
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:02,160
I got a bunch of trigger happy

969
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:03,428
weekend warriors out here with

970
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:06,297
their heads up their asses!

971
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:09,334
How's your ulcer colonel?

972
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:10,201
Still act up on you when you

973
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:12,770
get tense?

974
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:13,738
Screw you, carver.

975
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:17,508
No thanks.

976
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:18,343
I didn't enjoy it that much

977
00:51:18,376 --> 00:51:19,577
last time.

978
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:20,845
I didn't screw you.

979
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:21,779
You screwed yourself.

980
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:22,880
No!

981
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:23,548
No!

982
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:24,615
You sent me out into a hot lz

983
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:26,351
and then you left me there!

984
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:28,553
Do you read me?

985
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:29,154
You left me!

986
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:30,188
You missed your extraction

987
00:51:30,221 --> 00:51:30,821
rendezvous.

988
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:31,422
You knew what the risks were

989
00:51:31,456 --> 00:51:32,190
when you joined the covert

990
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,491
ops.

991
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:35,860
Well as much as I'd like to

992
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:39,330
reminisce about the old days

993
00:51:39,364 --> 00:51:41,299
colonel, I think it's about

994
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:42,800
time you called off your men

995
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:46,704
and have them surrender to us.

996
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:48,873
Well...

997
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:50,841
You got me there tough guy.

998
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:51,709
As much as I would like to say

999
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:53,744
we do, we have no personnel

1000
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:56,681
in or on the grounds.

1001
00:51:56,714 --> 00:51:57,448
You still hanging your men

1002
00:51:57,482 --> 00:52:00,151
out to dry, huh?

1003
00:52:00,185 --> 00:52:01,519
Okay...

1004
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:02,420
Well, you know what our

1005
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,354
demands are and you got less

1006
00:52:03,388 --> 00:52:05,623
than 2 hours to deliver.

1007
00:52:05,656 --> 00:52:06,424
Yeah...

1008
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:07,292
Kalmed farrukha.

1009
00:52:07,325 --> 00:52:08,759
We're working on it.

1010
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,161
So that's it!

1011
00:52:10,195 --> 00:52:11,429
We give you farrukha, you give

1012
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:13,464
us the goods and the hostages.

1013
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:16,334
Something like that.

1014
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:16,801
So what are they

1015
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:18,269
paying you Max?

1016
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:18,903
What's the going rate for

1017
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:21,606
selling out your country?

1018
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,240
You just have the jets

1019
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:23,674
standing by with enough fuel

1020
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:24,742
for a 5-hour journey and a

1021
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:25,876
safe transport to the

1022
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:27,645
airport...

1023
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:29,347
I'll be talkin' to you.

1024
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:38,323
Bet your ass

1025
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:41,926
we'll be talkin'.

1026
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:46,964
Carver served under you

1027
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,300
in desert storm?

1028
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:49,934
Missed that during the

1029
00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:50,835
thorough review of the files

1030
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:52,403
did you?

1031
00:52:52,437 --> 00:52:53,204
This means you've got to step

1032
00:52:53,238 --> 00:52:53,904
down from this operation

1033
00:52:53,938 --> 00:52:55,306
immediately.

1034
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,874
Forget it!

1035
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,376
His obvious hatred of you can

1036
00:52:58,409 --> 00:52:59,210
only inflame the entire

1037
00:52:59,244 --> 00:53:00,278
situation.

1038
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:00,911
The only thing being

1039
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:03,381
inflamed is my ulcer.

1040
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:03,981
Alright, which one of you

1041
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,951
military geniuses ordered

1042
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:09,654
your men to fire?

1043
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:27,872
hey!

1044
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:29,540
Hey!

1045
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:30,207
What are you doing in here?

1046
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:30,941
Hey man, is there any way out

1047
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:31,542
of here?

1048
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:32,042
Where you just came in is

1049
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:32,677
the way out of here.

1050
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:33,010
Now get moving or I'll call

1051
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:33,311
security.

1052
00:53:33,344 --> 00:53:33,578
No, no.

1053
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:34,211
No...

1054
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:34,479
There's guys out there with

1055
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:35,079
guns.

1056
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:36,681
Well, good then security's

1057
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:37,181
already here.

1058
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:37,515
Now, just get away.

1059
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:38,148
No, sir...

1060
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:38,449
Would you mind us explaining

1061
00:53:38,483 --> 00:53:38,749
to you--

1062
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:39,317
no! No!

1063
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:39,617
Let me explain something

1064
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:39,950
to you!

1065
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:42,487
Back off!

1066
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,254
Just get away from the door.

1067
00:53:43,288 --> 00:53:43,521
Oh, okay!

1068
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:44,955
Okay!

1069
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:45,556
Get away from the door.

1070
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:46,190
I'll spray your eyes out.

1071
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,358
Can we just talk to you just

1072
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:47,725
a second?

1073
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:48,359
Stand back.

1074
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:48,726
Stand back.

1075
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:17,422
I'll kill you American.

1076
00:54:31,836 --> 00:54:33,070
come on, come on.

1077
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:56,093
I am going to go see what is

1078
00:54:56,126 --> 00:55:00,331
going on.

1079
00:55:04,402 --> 00:55:06,036
Alone at last.

1080
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:10,007
Don't count on it.

1081
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:14,612
We just got a report of an

1082
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,414
explosion in the plant.

1083
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:17,047
How bad?

1084
00:55:17,081 --> 00:55:18,849
Our ultrasound teams said it

1085
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:20,117
wasn't very big, but they can

1086
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,018
hear the generator beginning

1087
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:25,790
to surge.

1088
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:26,724
Shit!

1089
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:27,358
Call the Pentagon.

1090
00:55:27,392 --> 00:55:28,426
Get them to fax me a copy of

1091
00:55:28,459 --> 00:55:29,126
carver's psychiatric

1092
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,429
evaluation.

1093
00:55:31,462 --> 00:55:32,062
If he was in g2, he should

1094
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:33,831
have one.

1095
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:34,499
Maybe we can get him to

1096
00:55:34,532 --> 00:55:35,032
come out here and lie it down

1097
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:37,368
on the couch for you?

1098
00:55:37,402 --> 00:55:37,902
I'm beginning to think he

1099
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:40,070
just might do it.

1100
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:41,372
You asked him how much

1101
00:55:41,406 --> 00:55:42,707
he was being paid.

1102
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,074
I don't think he's doing it

1103
00:55:44,108 --> 00:55:45,610
for the money.

1104
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:46,744
Oh no?

1105
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:48,446
Then why is he doing it?

1106
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:51,549
You tell me.

1107
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:06,397
oh, my god.

1108
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:17,508
hey, come on.

1109
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:20,010
Hey, hey...You alright?

1110
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:25,916
I killed him.

1111
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:29,887
You saved my life though.

1112
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,621
I've never even touched

1113
00:56:30,655 --> 00:56:33,891
a gun before.

1114
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:34,659
You didn't have a choice,

1115
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:37,027
Jenny.

1116
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:47,938
where are we going?

1117
00:56:47,972 --> 00:56:48,839
The water plant.

1118
00:56:48,873 --> 00:56:49,406
What?

1119
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,074
Shouldn't we find a way

1120
00:56:50,107 --> 00:56:51,476
out of here?

1121
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:52,109
I overhead these guys

1122
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:52,943
talking, I mean, they said

1123
00:56:52,977 --> 00:56:53,578
they're gonna poison

1124
00:56:53,611 --> 00:56:54,078
all the water.

1125
00:56:54,111 --> 00:56:55,012
We gotta stop them.

1126
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:55,813
We?

1127
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:56,447
Yeah, alright.

1128
00:56:56,481 --> 00:56:57,047
Are you crazy?

1129
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:57,648
Jenny, I don't see anybody

1130
00:56:57,682 --> 00:56:58,483
else coming to our rescue

1131
00:56:58,516 --> 00:56:59,016
here.

1132
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:00,117
But...but the soldiers

1133
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:00,918
outside must have some

1134
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:01,886
kind of plan.

1135
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:02,319
We could be ruining

1136
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:03,754
the whole thing.

1137
00:57:03,788 --> 00:57:05,155
I can't take that chance.

1138
00:57:05,189 --> 00:57:05,823
What about the hostages?

1139
00:57:05,856 --> 00:57:06,824
We just can't just leave them

1140
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:07,958
there.

1141
00:57:09,494 --> 00:57:09,927
Oh, shit!

1142
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:10,227
Come on, let's go!

1143
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,662
Go!

1144
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:26,611
Well, it shouldn't

1145
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:29,914
be long now.

1146
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:30,781
What's the matter with you

1147
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:31,281
babe?

1148
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:34,051
Cat got your tongue?

1149
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:35,252
Why do you persist in trying

1150
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,021
to engage me in foolish

1151
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:37,955
conversation?

1152
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:38,756
Hey man, I'm just trying to

1153
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,591
break the ice.

1154
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:41,559
Didn't your mother ever talk

1155
00:57:41,592 --> 00:57:42,126
to you about the birds

1156
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:44,862
and the bees?

1157
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:45,796
Is this what passes for

1158
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:48,232
charm in your country?

1159
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:50,200
No!

1160
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:51,101
Money passes for charm in my

1161
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:56,140
country and pretty soon, I'm

1162
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:59,744
gonna have plenty of that.

1163
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:00,911
Then, I'm supposed to throw

1164
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:02,713
myself at you?

1165
00:58:02,747 --> 00:58:03,714
Well...

1166
00:58:03,748 --> 00:58:04,815
I don't know.

1167
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:05,816
You might, once you get to

1168
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:08,853
know me.

1169
00:58:08,886 --> 00:58:09,854
I don't want to know you

1170
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:12,723
You're a fool, you repulse me,

1171
00:58:12,757 --> 00:58:14,659
and I don't trust you.

1172
00:58:14,692 --> 00:58:16,193
You don't trust me?

1173
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:19,897
You don't trust me?

1174
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:20,731
You know if it weren't for me,

1175
00:58:20,765 --> 00:58:21,331
this whole operation would

1176
00:58:21,365 --> 00:58:21,999
have gone down the toilet

1177
00:58:22,032 --> 00:58:26,236
a long time ago.

1178
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:27,705
For one, you're an American

1179
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:30,140
and I hate Americans.

1180
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:31,108
Two, you are a traitor to your

1181
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:32,209
own country and I hate

1182
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:37,314
traitors even more.

1183
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,082
So it's not that you don't

1184
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:39,083
trust me...

1185
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:41,919
You just hate me.

1186
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:42,920
You see we're already relating

1187
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:44,922
like an old married couple.

1188
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:50,260
I love this.

1189
00:58:50,294 --> 00:58:50,961
Why do you make a joke

1190
00:58:50,995 --> 00:58:52,597
about everything?

1191
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:53,163
Why do you take everything

1192
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:57,167
so seriously?

1193
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,002
Because this is my

1194
00:58:58,035 --> 00:58:59,336
moment of truth.

1195
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,205
I've waited my entire life for

1196
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:05,309
an operation such as this.

1197
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:06,911
And I thank my brothers for the

1198
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:09,914
opportunity to die as a martyr

1199
00:59:09,947 --> 00:59:11,081
for our country, for our

1200
00:59:11,115 --> 00:59:15,786
leader and our cause.

1201
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,889
Honey, you're not gonna die.

1202
00:59:18,923 --> 00:59:19,790
When we get to your country,

1203
00:59:19,824 --> 00:59:25,029
we're gonna be heroes.

1204
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:28,165
You really are

1205
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:31,836
a fool, aren't you?

1206
00:59:46,851 --> 00:59:47,785
Where are you?

1207
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:48,853
I'm in the tunnel trailing

1208
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:50,020
the enemy agents.

1209
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:51,221
They killed faddem.

1210
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:52,322
Find them!

1211
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:57,261
Very well.

1212
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:07,638
come on!

1213
01:00:07,672 --> 01:00:08,105
Where are you going?

1214
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:08,639
Water tank.

1215
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:09,974
But he went that way!

1216
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:11,742
I know.

1217
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:13,878
Hold on.

1218
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:15,980
Oh, hold this.

1219
01:00:46,043 --> 01:00:52,783
it's about freaking time.

1220
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:08,065
colonel gentry.

1221
01:01:08,098 --> 01:01:11,368
What a pleasant surprise.

1222
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:33,818
three's a box with some guys

1223
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:35,319
guarding it.

1224
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:36,553
I'm calling the cops.

1225
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:37,822
Good idea.

1226
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,326
It's ringing.

1227
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:50,300
Speak!

1228
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:51,068
Yes?

1229
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:51,468
Hello?

1230
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:54,204
Who is this?

1231
01:02:54,238 --> 01:02:55,139
This is agent carver with

1232
01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:57,074
the FBI who is this?

1233
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:59,944
It's the FBI.

1234
01:02:59,977 --> 01:03:00,845
Oh, yeah, yeah...

1235
01:03:00,878 --> 01:03:03,380
I'm on the water power plant

1236
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:04,514
and um... I'm with a friend,

1237
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:05,816
we're on a school trip--

1238
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:06,851
yes, we know all about that.

1239
01:03:06,884 --> 01:03:08,118
Tell me exactly,

1240
01:03:08,152 --> 01:03:11,055
where are you?

1241
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:11,688
We're...

1242
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:13,490
We're near the water tanks.

1243
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:14,591
Tell him about the guy.

1244
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,026
Yeah, there's some guy and

1245
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,427
he's guarding some kind of a

1246
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:18,262
box and he's near the water

1247
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:20,030
treatment pool and he's

1248
01:03:20,064 --> 01:03:21,031
got a gun.

1249
01:03:21,065 --> 01:03:22,532
It's nerve gas.

1250
01:03:22,566 --> 01:03:23,300
Alright listen very

1251
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,201
carefully to me now,

1252
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:25,870
don't move, stay exactly

1253
01:03:25,903 --> 01:03:27,537
where you are.

1254
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:29,073
You're in grave danger.

1255
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:30,140
We'll to try to get you out as

1256
01:03:30,174 --> 01:03:31,541
soon as we can.

1257
01:03:31,575 --> 01:03:34,178
What should we do?

1258
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:36,280
Don't do anything.

1259
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:37,614
How did you get this phone

1260
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:38,883
number?

1261
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:39,416
I got it from one of the

1262
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:40,350
terrorists.

1263
01:03:40,384 --> 01:03:41,585
I dialed 911, it must be on

1264
01:03:41,618 --> 01:03:43,620
speed dial or something.

1265
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:44,254
Well, it's probably the one

1266
01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:47,124
they're using to negotiate.

1267
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,559
Alright, hold on to it and

1268
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:52,262
keep it on at all times

1269
01:03:52,296 --> 01:03:54,965
in case we need to reach you.

1270
01:03:54,999 --> 01:03:56,233
You understand?

1271
01:03:56,266 --> 01:03:57,334
Yeah, yeah...

1272
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:57,935
Um...

1273
01:03:57,968 --> 01:03:59,603
No... yeah, I understand.

1274
01:03:59,636 --> 01:04:01,371
Okay, we'll be in touch.

1275
01:04:01,405 --> 01:04:04,174
Please hurry.

1276
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:05,976
Don't worry.

1277
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:08,145
We will.

1278
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,380
Everything's gonna be okay.

1279
01:04:10,414 --> 01:04:12,616
They're on their way.

1280
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:13,550
It's some of those

1281
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,219
college kids.

1282
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:15,852
Somehow they got a hold of

1283
01:04:15,886 --> 01:04:17,387
Mohammed's phone and they're

1284
01:04:17,421 --> 01:04:19,223
hold up in an exit tunnel near

1285
01:04:19,256 --> 01:04:21,358
the water treatment plant.

1286
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:25,529
I'll take care of them.

1287
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:26,563
Wait...

1288
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,232
Please...

1289
01:04:28,265 --> 01:04:29,399
Don't hurt them.

1290
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:31,535
They're just kids.

1291
01:04:31,568 --> 01:04:32,269
They've killed two of our

1292
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:33,437
men.

1293
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:34,071
No.

1294
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:36,206
That's got to be a mistake.

1295
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,976
Don't go after them, please.

1296
01:04:39,009 --> 01:04:40,210
Very touching.

1297
01:04:40,244 --> 01:04:41,245
I'll tell them of your concern

1298
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:45,315
before I kill them.

1299
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:45,682
Jenny!

1300
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,583
Run!

1301
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:48,352
Hey!

1302
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:53,157
Hey, hey...

1303
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:54,959
Sweetheart.

1304
01:04:54,992 --> 01:04:57,027
You don't have a real grasp on

1305
01:04:57,061 --> 01:04:57,594
this whole hostage concept

1306
01:04:57,627 --> 01:05:00,030
do you?

1307
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:02,132
Alive, they're valuable

1308
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:03,033
bargaining chips,

1309
01:05:03,067 --> 01:05:06,503
they are no good to us dead.

1310
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:07,571
Could you practice a little

1311
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:08,638
restraint with your trigger

1312
01:05:08,672 --> 01:05:11,208
finger, okay?

1313
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,543
Understood.

1314
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:17,147
Okay.

1315
01:05:17,181 --> 01:05:18,048
FBI, I don't know,

1316
01:05:18,082 --> 01:05:18,548
but something sounds

1317
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:20,250
really weird to me.

1318
01:05:20,284 --> 01:05:21,018
What the hell did you want

1319
01:05:21,051 --> 01:05:21,718
them to say?

1320
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:22,586
Kill the terrorist and

1321
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:25,155
dismantle the bomb?

1322
01:05:25,189 --> 01:05:27,357
We're the only ones who can.

1323
01:05:27,391 --> 01:05:30,294
Abdul come in.

1324
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:31,428
This is Abdul, go ahead.

1325
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:32,396
Yeah, be advised.

1326
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:33,497
There are 2 undesirable by the

1327
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:40,437
catwalk exit near you.

1328
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,206
Yes, I can see them.

1329
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:42,772
Shit!

1330
01:05:42,806 --> 01:05:44,274
They know where we were.

1331
01:05:44,308 --> 01:05:47,111
Stay at your post.

1332
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:47,677
We'll deal with them.

1333
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:48,979
I understand.

1334
01:05:49,013 --> 01:05:50,580
That sounds like the FBI

1335
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,549
agent I was just talking to.

1336
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:53,350
Oh, well then, that answers

1337
01:05:53,383 --> 01:05:54,218
my question.

1338
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:55,319
I think they just saw me in

1339
01:05:55,352 --> 01:05:56,987
the back.

1340
01:05:57,021 --> 01:05:57,721
It's alright.

1341
01:05:57,754 --> 01:05:58,655
Elia is on her way.

1342
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:00,157
Just be aware of them.

1343
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:01,425
Shit!

1344
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:02,159
Oh my god, we're sitting

1345
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:02,692
ducks.

1346
01:06:02,726 --> 01:06:03,660
I understand.

1347
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:05,262
Abdul out.

1348
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:06,163
Relax, we'll just have to

1349
01:06:06,196 --> 01:06:06,730
think, think...

1350
01:06:06,763 --> 01:06:08,265
Think...

1351
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:10,634
Come on.

1352
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:24,748
Just college kids, huh?

1353
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:29,386
come in momad.

1354
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:30,754
Yes, elia.

1355
01:06:30,787 --> 01:06:32,056
What is it?

1356
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:33,223
I found Mohammed.

1357
01:06:33,257 --> 01:06:34,691
He's dead.

1358
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:35,659
Very well.

1359
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:36,460
Meet me at the water treatment

1360
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:38,195
tank.

1361
01:06:38,228 --> 01:06:40,464
Understood.

1362
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:47,137
It worked,

1363
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:49,306
we're behind them.

1364
01:06:51,575 --> 01:06:52,309
Ssh...

1365
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:52,909
Someone's coming.

1366
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:54,211
Abdul, where did they go?

1367
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:55,245
They were there a moment ago.

1368
01:06:55,279 --> 01:06:57,247
Go, go.

1369
01:06:58,782 --> 01:07:00,484
What's that?

1370
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:01,218
There they go!

1371
01:07:01,251 --> 01:07:02,552
Elia come with me!

1372
01:07:13,597 --> 01:07:14,030
go that way.

1373
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:20,770
I'll go this way.

1374
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:11,155
Bastards!

1375
01:08:11,488 --> 01:08:13,823
Drop the gun slowly...

1376
01:08:13,857 --> 01:08:16,760
Really slowly.

1377
01:08:17,194 --> 01:08:19,363
Attagirl, take it easy...

1378
01:08:19,396 --> 01:08:20,330
Yeah..

1379
01:08:20,364 --> 01:08:22,732
Drop it, get up and turn

1380
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:23,900
around...

1381
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:29,439
Slowly.

1382
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,189
What?

1383
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:45,855
Elia!

1384
01:08:45,889 --> 01:08:50,927
Go, go!

1385
01:08:57,334 --> 01:08:58,302
Who is it?

1386
01:08:58,335 --> 01:08:59,169
It's me.

1387
01:08:59,203 --> 01:08:59,903
Farrukha's here.

1388
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:02,172
Be right there.

1389
01:09:02,206 --> 01:09:04,741
Come.

1390
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:08,445
Let me go after them.

1391
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,614
We'll deal with them later.

1392
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,650
Just remember farrukha,

1393
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:15,585
any funny stuff,

1394
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:16,886
you're the first to go.

1395
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,389
I promise you that.

1396
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:21,625
You forget colonel that I am

1397
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:24,561
and have always been quite

1398
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:27,564
ready to die for my cause.

1399
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:28,164
You screw this up, you're

1400
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:31,501
gonna get your big chance.

1401
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,205
It's show time!

1402
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:37,374
Alright, let's go!

1403
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,308
He's here?

1404
01:09:38,342 --> 01:09:39,609
Let me come with you.

1405
01:09:39,643 --> 01:09:40,444
No, we need you

1406
01:09:40,477 --> 01:09:42,579
to watch the hostages.

1407
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:43,913
Don't worry, you'll see

1408
01:09:43,947 --> 01:09:46,250
your husband soon enough.

1409
01:09:46,283 --> 01:09:47,884
Husband?

1410
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:48,885
Yes, kalmed farrukha

1411
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,355
is my husband.

1412
01:09:51,388 --> 01:09:54,391
Well... of course you realize

1413
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:58,895
that our engagement is off.

1414
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:04,000
Let's rock!

1415
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:04,768
You to let me

1416
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:06,002
handle this colonel.

1417
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:06,936
Negative.

1418
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:07,604
Carver's psychiatric

1419
01:10:07,637 --> 01:10:08,905
evaluation is a textbook case

1420
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:10,740
of sociopathic paranoia and

1421
01:10:10,774 --> 01:10:12,909
megalomaniacal delusions.

1422
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:13,443
You picked that all up

1423
01:10:13,477 --> 01:10:14,544
in 1 file even though

1424
01:10:14,578 --> 01:10:15,945
the army shrink's missed it?

1425
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:17,347
I don't think they missed it.

1426
01:10:17,381 --> 01:10:18,448
I think that's why they put

1427
01:10:18,482 --> 01:10:19,249
him on covert ops in the first

1428
01:10:19,283 --> 01:10:20,284
place.

1429
01:10:20,317 --> 01:10:20,784
Sociopaths make perfect

1430
01:10:20,817 --> 01:10:22,286
operatives.

1431
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:23,019
They can blend in anywhere and

1432
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,654
can kill without hesitation

1433
01:10:24,688 --> 01:10:25,955
because they don't feel pity,

1434
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:27,924
compassion or remorse.

1435
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:29,259
But the only emotion they do

1436
01:10:29,293 --> 01:10:30,560
feel is hatred and when that

1437
01:10:30,594 --> 01:10:33,029
comes to a boil, not even they

1438
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,664
can control it.

1439
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:36,966
Carver is a ticking time bomb

1440
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,968
and you are the fuse.

1441
01:10:39,002 --> 01:10:39,936
Well unfortunately agent

1442
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:41,271
woods, we haven't got time to

1443
01:10:41,305 --> 01:10:42,472
discuss your little theory

1444
01:10:42,506 --> 01:10:43,740
with the experts.

1445
01:10:43,773 --> 01:10:45,575
I am the expert.

1446
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:50,547
And I know carver.

1447
01:10:58,021 --> 01:11:00,490
okay, gentry send him over.

1448
01:11:00,524 --> 01:11:01,825
Not so fast sergeant.

1449
01:11:01,858 --> 01:11:02,726
This is supposed to be

1450
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,628
a trade.

1451
01:11:04,661 --> 01:11:05,194
Well, we'll hand over the

1452
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:06,663
gas when he's over here

1453
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:07,831
with us.

1454
01:11:07,864 --> 01:11:10,367
Negative soldier.

1455
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,403
It's not the way it's gonna be.

1456
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:16,406
Take it or leave it colonel.

1457
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:18,308
Don't push him.

1458
01:11:18,342 --> 01:11:18,842
Let me ask you something

1459
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,345
carver.

1460
01:11:21,378 --> 01:11:22,779
What's in this for you?

1461
01:11:22,812 --> 01:11:23,847
Do you really wanna be a

1462
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,581
martyr for someone else's

1463
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:26,082
cause?

1464
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,351
I have no intention of being

1465
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:29,719
a martyr.

1466
01:11:29,753 --> 01:11:31,588
How about your friends?

1467
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,757
What's their intention?

1468
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:36,893
Don't listen to him.

1469
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:37,527
Well, do you know that your

1470
01:11:37,561 --> 01:11:38,562
sister did say to me she was

1471
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:40,063
here to die.

1472
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:41,097
My sister is young and

1473
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,900
idealistic.

1474
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:48,505
It's part of her training.

1475
01:11:50,006 --> 01:11:50,807
I tell you what, you don't

1476
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,741
worry about me colonel.

1477
01:11:51,775 --> 01:11:54,711
I have my own cause.

1478
01:11:54,744 --> 01:11:56,480
Jesus Christ carver,

1479
01:11:56,513 --> 01:11:57,447
you still whining about that

1480
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:59,749
goddamn war?

1481
01:11:59,783 --> 01:12:00,684
I thought you were a soldier,

1482
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:01,618
not a sniveling little

1483
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:02,986
schoolgirl.

1484
01:12:03,019 --> 01:12:06,823
Careful.

1485
01:12:07,924 --> 01:12:08,525
Do you have any idea

1486
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:12,562
what I had to do to survive?

1487
01:12:12,596 --> 01:12:13,930
Eat bugs, drink my own piss,

1488
01:12:13,963 --> 01:12:14,931
live in a hole in the ground

1489
01:12:14,964 --> 01:12:16,566
with the enemy all around me.

1490
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,401
The enemy is still all around

1491
01:12:17,434 --> 01:12:18,502
you carver, but you're too

1492
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:20,704
stupid to even hide from them.

1493
01:12:20,737 --> 01:12:21,405
No!

1494
01:12:21,438 --> 01:12:22,706
No!

1495
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:24,608
I'm smart enough to realize

1496
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:29,913
that everybody is my enemy.

1497
01:12:29,946 --> 01:12:30,980
That puts you out there

1498
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:32,516
pretty much by yourself.

1499
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:33,783
Doesn't it Max?

1500
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:34,818
I am warning you,

1501
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:37,020
you're pushing him too far.

1502
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:38,021
Don't listen to him,

1503
01:12:38,054 --> 01:12:38,988
my friend.

1504
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:42,158
You shut up!

1505
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,993
You're not my friend.

1506
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:45,161
That's right Max.

1507
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,796
None of these people

1508
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:47,697
are your friends.

1509
01:12:47,731 --> 01:12:52,368
They're using you.

1510
01:12:53,169 --> 01:12:54,671
Like you used me.

1511
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:55,839
Max!

1512
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:58,041
Don't listen to him.

1513
01:12:58,074 --> 01:12:59,709
He's trying to confuse you.

1514
01:12:59,743 --> 01:13:02,479
You shut up too!

1515
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:05,715
That's right Max, I used you.

1516
01:13:05,749 --> 01:13:08,151
You're an eager little gung-ho

1517
01:13:08,184 --> 01:13:09,919
warrior, thought you were

1518
01:13:09,953 --> 01:13:11,588
invincible.

1519
01:13:11,621 --> 01:13:12,589
I put you out on a suicide

1520
01:13:12,622 --> 01:13:14,190
mission because you're the

1521
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,526
only guy in my command that

1522
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,629
I knew would never be missed.

1523
01:13:19,663 --> 01:13:21,431
You pathetic dickless

1524
01:13:21,465 --> 01:13:27,103
little loser, you!

1525
01:13:28,705 --> 01:13:29,573
Are you gonna

1526
01:13:29,606 --> 01:13:31,675
send him over or not?

1527
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:33,977
Negative.

1528
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,178
Fine.

1529
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:39,849
You can keep him.

1530
01:13:44,654 --> 01:13:46,089
Now you understand.

1531
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:47,857
Now you understand.

1532
01:13:47,891 --> 01:13:50,960
Allah!

1533
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:02,038
Kalmed!

1534
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:18,121
You idiot!

1535
01:14:18,154 --> 01:14:22,158
You ruined everything.

1536
01:14:26,596 --> 01:14:30,033
Mo, mo...

1537
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:34,037
Go ahead.

1538
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:37,574
This shit is fun, ain't it?

1539
01:14:47,851 --> 01:14:49,152
Ceasefire!

1540
01:14:49,185 --> 01:15:00,163
Hold your fire!

1541
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:07,136
bill, have your men on ready

1542
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,305
alert and in position.

1543
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,941
We're going in.

1544
01:15:12,275 --> 01:15:13,009
So much for peaceful

1545
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:15,244
negotiations.

1546
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:26,590
Abdul come in.

1547
01:15:26,623 --> 01:15:28,257
Yes my leader, come in.

1548
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:29,092
Prepare for your moment

1549
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:31,828
of truth.

1550
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:35,932
Yes my leader.

1551
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:38,602
Shukran.

1552
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:41,738
Thank you.

1553
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:46,643
This is it.

1554
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:47,911
You know what to do?

1555
01:15:47,944 --> 01:15:48,778
Yeah.

1556
01:15:48,812 --> 01:15:50,747
Alright.

1557
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,168
Well I guess the engagement's

1558
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:14,370
back on.

1559
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:15,872
What?

1560
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,874
Oh yeah, farrukha's dead.

1561
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:19,075
Your brother screwed

1562
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:20,810
everything up.

1563
01:16:20,844 --> 01:16:22,211
It's just you and me now, just

1564
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:23,813
like it oughtta be and I know

1565
01:16:23,847 --> 01:16:25,649
the greatest little seaside

1566
01:16:25,682 --> 01:16:27,016
resort down in Mexico.

1567
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:28,952
It's perfect for our

1568
01:16:28,985 --> 01:16:29,753
honeymoon.

1569
01:16:29,786 --> 01:16:31,688
Elia!

1570
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:36,793
oh!

1571
01:16:36,826 --> 01:16:37,927
Party's over momed,

1572
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:39,095
party's over.

1573
01:16:39,128 --> 01:16:40,997
Say hello to Allah for me.

1574
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:44,934
Go ahead, shoot me...

1575
01:16:44,968 --> 01:16:47,737
You kill us all.

1576
01:16:48,872 --> 01:16:50,707
Go ahead.

1577
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:51,374
Oh!

1578
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:53,109
We got us a Mexican standoff!

1579
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:56,312
You see in Mexico, a standoff.

1580
01:16:58,247 --> 01:16:59,248
Elia!

1581
01:16:59,282 --> 01:17:01,084
What are you doing?

1582
01:17:09,793 --> 01:17:11,227
Are you crazy?

1583
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:14,430
You might have killed me!

1584
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:18,001
I still might.

1585
01:17:21,204 --> 01:17:23,106
Hey you!

1586
01:18:03,112 --> 01:18:03,847
It's on the remote,

1587
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:04,413
get the bomb!

1588
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:05,348
I can't it's too far...

1589
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:06,249
I'm not that fast!

1590
01:18:06,282 --> 01:18:06,883
You can make it.

1591
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:09,052
Get the bomb!

1592
01:18:41,818 --> 01:18:42,451
Give that to me!

1593
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:54,230
What was that?

1594
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:55,298
Explosion by the water

1595
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:57,733
treatment tank.

1596
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:32,501
Wait...

1597
01:19:32,535 --> 01:19:33,069
The beaker is intact.

1598
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:33,837
I repeat, the beaker is

1599
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:34,804
intact.

1600
01:19:34,838 --> 01:19:35,571
Looks like a couple of kids

1601
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,808
have got it.

1602
01:19:50,186 --> 01:19:51,187
command center to ultrasound,

1603
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,421
what's the status in the

1604
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:54,057
generator surge?

1605
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:58,427
We're taking reading now.

1606
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:00,864
Shouldn't we get

1607
01:20:00,897 --> 01:20:02,131
rid of that thing?

1608
01:20:02,165 --> 01:20:02,698
There's more of this stuff

1609
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:05,268
and we're gonna get it.

1610
01:20:22,085 --> 01:20:22,986
Oh shit!

1611
01:20:23,019 --> 01:20:24,320
Come on!

1612
01:20:30,193 --> 01:20:31,094
The entire plant is reaching

1613
01:20:31,127 --> 01:20:32,361
critical condition.

1614
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:33,129
I recommend an immediate

1615
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:34,430
withdrawal.

1616
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:36,532
How much time do we have?

1617
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:37,333
It sounds like it can go any

1618
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:39,969
minute.

1619
01:20:40,003 --> 01:20:40,603
Command center to tactical,

1620
01:20:40,636 --> 01:20:42,171
start pulling everyone back,

1621
01:20:42,205 --> 01:20:42,939
the explosion should destroy

1622
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:45,574
the virus.

1623
01:20:47,543 --> 01:20:52,215
Kalmed died like a hero.

1624
01:20:52,248 --> 01:20:55,351
It was to be expected.

1625
01:20:55,384 --> 01:20:56,252
I was hoping we would die

1626
01:20:56,285 --> 01:20:59,188
side by side, but at least we

1627
01:20:59,222 --> 01:21:01,157
will get to die together.

1628
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,325
I'm sorry elia, my mission

1629
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:06,462
is not yet complete.

1630
01:21:06,495 --> 01:21:07,530
We've contaminated the water.

1631
01:21:07,563 --> 01:21:09,132
What else is there?

1632
01:21:09,165 --> 01:21:10,466
This...

1633
01:21:10,499 --> 01:21:11,500
I must bring it back to our

1634
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:12,535
home, and there are other

1635
01:21:12,568 --> 01:21:16,139
battles to be won.

1636
01:21:16,172 --> 01:21:17,540
And me?

1637
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:18,908
Elia, this is your moment

1638
01:21:18,942 --> 01:21:22,111
of truth.

1639
01:21:22,145 --> 01:21:24,547
You know what you must do.

1640
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:24,981
Perhaps I should

1641
01:21:25,014 --> 01:21:27,050
take this back.

1642
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:28,251
I wouldn't want to spoil your

1643
01:21:28,284 --> 01:21:29,618
moment of truth.

1644
01:21:29,652 --> 01:21:31,320
Elia, what are you doing?

1645
01:21:31,354 --> 01:21:33,522
You must follow your orders!

1646
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:34,657
Now, give that to me!

1647
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:37,260
Are you afraid to die?

1648
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:38,161
Are you insane?

1649
01:21:38,194 --> 01:21:38,995
Of course, I'm not afraid to

1650
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:40,329
die...

1651
01:21:40,363 --> 01:21:41,931
It's just not my time!

1652
01:21:41,965 --> 01:21:45,334
Now give that to me!

1653
01:21:45,368 --> 01:21:47,436
Hey!

1654
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:52,908
Don't shoot!

1655
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:54,077
You'll kill us all!

1656
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:56,679
So be it!!

1657
01:21:57,513 --> 01:21:58,547
We need that to complete

1658
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:00,416
our mission!

1659
01:22:01,117 --> 01:22:03,252
Hey you!

1660
01:22:09,993 --> 01:22:11,460
Everyone, get out!

1661
01:22:11,494 --> 01:22:12,261
Now!

1662
01:22:12,295 --> 01:22:14,297
Go!

1663
01:22:56,139 --> 01:22:56,739
I'll kill you!

1664
01:22:56,772 --> 01:22:58,507
I'll kill you American!

1665
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:01,244
I'll kill you!

1666
01:23:21,564 --> 01:23:21,964
Bruce!

1667
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,567
Get the beaker!

1668
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:28,471
Oh, shit!

1669
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,383
Hey come on!

1670
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:42,051
Everyone, over here!

1671
01:23:42,085 --> 01:23:42,485
Let's go.

1672
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:45,388
Let's go!

1673
01:23:46,389 --> 01:23:47,156
Slater!

1674
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:49,692
Catch!

1675
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:19,355
Bruce, let's go!

1676
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:18,214
I'll take that

1677
01:25:18,247 --> 01:25:18,914
off your hands.

1678
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:22,885
It's a pleasure.

1679
01:25:28,257 --> 01:25:29,358
How do you feel?

1680
01:25:29,392 --> 01:25:34,230
Nice catch slater.

1681
01:25:34,263 --> 01:25:36,865
Nice throw man.

1682
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:39,735
I guess I'm gonna be off for

1683
01:25:39,768 --> 01:25:40,436
the season, huh?

1684
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:41,870
It looks that way.

1685
01:25:41,904 --> 01:25:44,307
Is that all you guys think

1686
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,241
about?

1687
01:25:45,274 --> 01:25:46,909
It's football?

1688
01:25:46,942 --> 01:25:48,377
It's not all we think about.

1689
01:25:48,944 --> 01:25:49,512
Ow...

1690
01:25:49,545 --> 01:25:50,846
Hey, about that dance huh?

1691
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:52,215
Hey!

1692
01:25:52,248 --> 01:25:52,881
Wait a second, I thought you

1693
01:25:52,915 --> 01:25:54,350
don't go out with jocks.

1694
01:25:54,383 --> 01:25:55,851
I think we should, uh...

1695
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:57,753
Skip the dance.
