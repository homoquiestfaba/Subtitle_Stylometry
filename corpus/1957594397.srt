a little strange lately.

 own interests.

168
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,600
But to have a live-in, I mean,
 maybe that's a little overkill.

 at a one-month retainer.

If it doesn't work out
 for you after a month,

172
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,960
you and I will sit
 down, and we'll

173
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,830
figure something else out.

174
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,000

 don't know if I want

176
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,330

 think about doing this?

177
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,110
I don't know, actually.

178
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,430
I wasn't thinking about it,
 and it's hard to explain it.

179
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,060
Just one day, the idea
 popped into my head,

180
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,840

 came into my office,

181

Charles gave me this book,
 "Lady Chatterley's Lover,"

402
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,070
and every time I read it, I
 have the most vivid daydreams,

And there's something
 wrong with that?

405
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,230
Well, no, not in this
 book, but then I found out

406
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,430
it belonged to a dead woman, a
 silent movie star, Vera Montez,

407
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,790
and she used to practice the
 occult. And then, this woman,

408
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,660
she shows up in my house,
 and she becomes my maid.

409
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,420
Wait, slow down.

 she keeps undressing, OK,

 while I'm sleeping.

414
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,520
OK.

415
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,430
So you think this all has
 something to do with that book.
