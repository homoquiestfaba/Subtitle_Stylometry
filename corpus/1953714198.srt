00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:30,629

13

17

00:29:55,795 --> 00:30:00,764
<i>Just fuck my mother as well,</i>
<i>you Jesus Christ, man.</i>

345
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,367
Major job. Major problem.

346
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:06,103
But don't worry about that.
I can take care of that.

347
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:07,971
<i>That's my job.</i>

348
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,745
So you enjoy
installing cable?

349
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:16,713
Fills the fridge.

350
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:18,849
I have 16 kids.

351
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,552
16?

352
00:30:21,554 --> 00:30:23,954
17. One is retarded.

353
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:30,828
But you know, it's just
a temporary job

354
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,731
until I find out
exactly what I want.

355
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:36,133
I understand that.

356
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:37,601
How long you been
doing this?

357
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:40,437
16.
16 months?

358
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:43,373
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Oh.</i>

359
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,176
[Phone rings]

360
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,912
Hey, baby.
<i>Hey, crazy.</i>

361
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:51,048
<i>Look, I forgot to tell you the cable</i>
<i>guy's going to show up later today,</i>

362
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,116
<i>so when he does, let me know.</i>
<i>I have some questions--</i>

363
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:55,619
He's here right now.
And don't call me crazy, crazy.

364
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:58,589
Hey, ask him about hooking up the internet.

365
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:02,292
<i>Ah, it's working</i>
<i>now, Lizzy.</i>

366
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:05,462
Oh, no. He can't do
anything about the internet.

367
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,564
Baby, listen to me.

368
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:10,934
Baby, he can. Just ask him.
Cable companies do internet, too.

369
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:12,703
Okay, I'll ask him but just stop yelling at me.

370
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:15,505
Ah, I know.

371
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:17,708
Don't tell me.

372
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,577
Your old man wants internet, too, right? Yeah.

373
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,914
Don't do it.

374
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,717
You know why?

375
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,085
Why?

376
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:30,420
Between me and you.
Right.

377
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:33,056
He wants to check out hot chicks.
Why?

378
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,058
To get fresh pussy.
That's what he wants.

379
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,661
Because yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, he wants fresh pussy. Oh, really?

380
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:39,429
You can cool down now.

381
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,298
You know, you're--
Nobody wants--

382
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,268
Yeah, yeah,
but cool chicks.

383
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,536
Cold meat?
That's what you are in his eyes.

384
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,238
Cold meat.

385
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,107
You're not hot chicks anymore, okay? Okay.

386
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:52,009
Yeah, but don't get
too discouraged.

387
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:53,911
You know, in my eyes,
you're hot.

388
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,779
Oh, thank you.

389
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:57,848
You know why you're hot?
Why?

390
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,316
Because
you're sexy.

391
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:00,851
You know why you're sexy?
Why?

392
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:02,886
Because you're
very stupid.

393
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,121
Oh, I'm stupid.
Yeah, you are.

394
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:06,089
Stupid and sex--

395
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,026
Stupidity is sexiness.
Oh, I'm stupid. Okay.

396
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:10,861
Very stupid.
Right.

397
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:13,330
And you're sexy.
Oh, great. Thank you.

398
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,499
What do we need to do
about this connection here?

399
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:19,002
Let's see.
I need for you to show me where the connection is.

400
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,904
I-- let's go.
This way. Let's go.

401
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:23,173
I love that.
Anyway...

402
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,142
Call me.
This is my business card.

403
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:27,210
If a woman answers,
hang up.

404
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,988
[Lizzy]
Just right this way.

405
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,103
All right.
You know, Lizzy.

406
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:55,672
There must be a cut cable
somewhere around here.

407
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:58,408
[Jared muttering]

408
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:03,180
There we go.

409
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:07,050
Oh, I guess--
No, I'm sorry.

410
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:10,220
Oh, you know what?
Must be here.

411
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:11,822
It must be in here.

412
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:12,990
Just got
to get it open.

413
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:16,727
[Grunts]
Okay.

414
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:18,795
I don't know.
It's nailed shut or something.

415
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:20,063
I can't get it open.
Yeah.

416
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:22,165
It's a man's job, Lizzy.

417
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,401
It's a man's job.
You'll learn that sooner or later.

418
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:26,703
Give Mr. Macho
a break here.

419
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:37,014
[Gasps]
No.

420
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:41,151
We've got to get some guys to
move that board away later.

421
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:45,088
I don't know. What's--
what's in there anyway?

422
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,758
I mean, like Jimmy Hoffa?

423
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,193
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I'm not going down there.</i>

424
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,962
<i>I mean, can't you just</i>
<i>hook it up, or--</i>

425
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:54,097
No. No, Lizzy.
It's a no-no.

426
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,800
No. We have to get
this cable here.

427
00:33:56,802 --> 00:34:00,337
First we want to unhook it,
and then we move on from there.

428
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:03,373
We wouldn't want to get into any more violations.

429
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:07,477
Code violations here, okay?
So you don't want that. Trust me.

430
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,281
[Gasps]
Damn it!

431

[Scattered voices]

432
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:29,493
Oh, yeah.
Ow, ow, ow.

Okay, just...

437
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:16,006
[normal voice] Not again.
Just focus.

438
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:18,775
Stay calm.
Just focus.

Stay away from me.
Get away from me. No.

No, no, no.

449
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,594
Don't come near me.
No!

Lizzy, my nana gave me that vase.

451
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:18,368
Jason?
Nana gave me this vase.

What-- are you
shitting me right now?

you're such an asshole!

I'm not your friggin'
little brother.

00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,843
Lizzy, it was
just a joke.

Lizzy.

457
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:29,946
I was just joking around.

458
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,888
Look, it's just a joke.

459
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,490
Lizzy.

460
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,500
Great.

Come in.

466
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,717
Forgive me?
No.

467
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,454
Why did you
do that?

468
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:45,789
You know that
I hate scary movies.

469
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,625
You scared the crap
out of me.

470
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:52,062
It was almost like you thought it was funny.

471
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:53,763
Not cool.

472
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,766
I know, I'm...

473
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,003
I'm sorry.

474
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,339
It was really stupid,
really immature,

475
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:07,510
and... I'm really
sorry, baby.

476
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:11,014
I won't do it again.

477
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:18,655
Sorry.

I'm sorry.

[Softly]
It's okay.

480
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:37,467
I don't know.
I'm-I'm worried that they're coming back.

481
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:40,437
Listen, Lizzy.
Now that you've moved back into that environment,

482
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:41,871
I'd like to give it
another shot.

483
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:43,573
Give what
another shot?

484
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:45,141
Hypnotherapy.

485
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,110
No, no!
Absolutely not!

486
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:49,579
Lizzy, there's no way you can
move forward with your life

487
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:51,581
unless you understand
and know your past.

488
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:54,083
Yes, I can.

489
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,986
People move forward with their lives
without knowing about their pasts.

490
00:40:56,988 --> 00:41:00,356
People with amnesia
or whatever.

491
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:02,559
<i>You know, I don't want</i>
<i>to care about the past.</i>

<i>I finally have a life</i>
<i>with Jason.</i>

493
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,931
The past is over and done with.
Who cares?

494
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:10,333
Can't you just give me some stronger pills or something

495
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:12,135
and then we can both move forward with our lives.

496
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:15,138
All right, listen.

497
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,308
These pills are quite a bit different
than the ones I've been giving you.

498
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,544
They're-- they're stronger and
they have more of a calming effect

499
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:25,815
than a feel good effect.
And you're not meant to drink alcohol with them.

500
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,618
Is that understood? Yes.
No, no, thank you, Doctor.

501
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,488
No alcohol.
Yes.

502
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,958
It makes
their effect stronger.

503
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,792
There you go.

504
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,028
No alcohol.

505
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,597
Yes. Thank you.

Whoa, Jay.
Jay.

509
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:11,794
Sorry.
You just scared the shit out of me.

510
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:13,062
I'm sorry.
No, that's all right.

511
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,000
You feeling all right?

512
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:20,136
Yeah, I'm fine. I just feel a little,
you know, out of it.

513
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:22,238
Oh, you been drinking
with Lizzy all night.

514
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,341
No, we got into a fight and I
didn't get much sleep anyways,

515
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:26,809
but I just feel
kind of beat up.

516
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:28,545
Oh, you want
the day off?

517
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:30,680
Oh, fuck no, man.
I need the money.

518
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:32,382
Good, well, get your ass
in the goddamn truck.

519
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,216
We have work to do.

520
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,701
Hey, babe.

521
00:42:51,703 --> 00:42:54,604
Um... hi.

522
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,240
What's wrong?

523
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,977
Are you drunk?

524
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:05,048
No. I had a few beers,
but I'm not drunk. Why?

525
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,417
Because
it's nine o'clock,

526
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:09,018
and you're just now
getting home,

527
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,220
and you're slurring
your words a little bit.

528
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:13,723
Well, I got off late and the new
foreman wanted to grab a beer

529
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:15,458
and talk about
a job next week.

530
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,727
Really? So why didn't you
call me and tell me that?

531
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:20,163
Because I left
my phone at the shop.

532
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:23,066
We went from the site
to the bar.

533
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:26,336
I don't believe you.
What?

534
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:28,771
Your coming home drunk this late?
It's pretty convenient

535
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,740
that you didn't have
your phone on you.

536
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:32,609
Why am I getting
the third degree?

537
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:34,143
I don't get
to mind myself.

538
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,629
Why are you
so angry?

539
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:54,464
I'm not angry,
all right?

540
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:56,399
It's just that
I work hard all day

541
00:43:56,401 --> 00:43:59,769
and come home to you
flipping out on me?

542
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:01,571
Crazy, I should be getting a blow job or--

543
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:03,339
Stop fucking
calling me that, okay?

544
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:05,241
Blow job, seriously?

545
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:07,777
I've been home all day expecting you at five o'clock.

546
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:10,647
Here it is nine o'clock and I haven't
heard a fucking word until now?

547
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:11,881
Did you hear
what I said?

548
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:13,449
I don't have
my phone.

549
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:14,951
Why didn't you use
a pay phone,

550
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:17,687
or your boss's cell phone
or something?

551
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:20,056
You want me to use
my boss's cell phone

552
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:22,959
to call you just because you're insecure?

553
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:25,695
Oh, so now
I'm insecure...

554
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:27,797
and a crazy person?

555
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:30,533
What do you think
I was doing?

556
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:32,035
You think I was fucking
some chick?

557
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:36,072
Well, you've
done it before.

558
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,986
[Agonized screaming]

559
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:40,036
[agonized screaming]

560
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,311
Are you okay?

561
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,217
Yeah, I think so.

562
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:56,385
It looked like you hit your head pretty hard.

563
00:45:58,388 --> 00:45:59,188
Who are you?

564
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,458
I'm so sorry.
I'm your new neighbor.

565
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,260
I'm Maggie.

566
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,429
I saw that you guys
moved in last week

567
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,030
and I've been meaning to come over and say hello

568
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:09,265
but I just haven't
had a chance.

569
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,667
And I heard
your husband--

570
00:46:11,669 --> 00:46:13,436
Oh, he's not
my husband.

571
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:16,072
Well, I heard your boyfriend get in his truck

572
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:18,141
and drive away
real fast.

573
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:19,342
He did?

574
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,945
Yeah, we got
into a fight

575
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,814
and I said some things
to really piss him off,

576
00:46:24,816 --> 00:46:26,482
so he does that.

577
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:28,317
I completely understand.

578
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,820
My boyfriend and I
just broke-up, so...

579
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:39,061
So, why were you--

580
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:40,797
Well, I heard your--

581
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:43,266
I heard your boyfriend--
Jason.

582
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:45,101
Jason leave,

583
00:46:45,103 --> 00:46:48,437
and then I heard screams
coming from in here.

584
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:51,808
You heard screams from in here?
Yeah.

585
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,844
Oh, that's strange.
I, um--

586
00:46:54,846 --> 00:46:59,248
I think I took a nap
after Jason left.

587
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,184
Well, I know
what I heard.

588
00:47:01,186 --> 00:47:04,253
And I--
I think it was you.

589
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:08,591
Another nightmare.

590
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,060
A nightmare.

591
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:13,429
Um... I got up
really quickly

592
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:16,532
and I got dizzy,
and then I saw you out here.

593
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:20,603
And at the time,
I couldn't really see you, and...

594
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:22,004
I thought you were here to hurt me.

595
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,940
Oh my God.
Not at all.

596
00:47:23,942 --> 00:47:25,441
The door was unlocked,

597
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:26,943
and I saw you there
in the hallway,

598
00:47:26,945 --> 00:47:28,845
and I asked
if you were okay.

599
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,115
Well, I thought
I heard a voice,

600
00:47:33,117 --> 00:47:35,117
but it didn't make
any sense.

601
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,653
Well, I was really loud.
I mean, I feel really bad.

602
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:39,288
No, no,
don't feel bad.

603
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,625
I-I've been feeling
really strange lately.

604
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:44,727
Ever since I moved
back into this house,

605
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:47,096
all sorts of weird things have been happening to me.

606
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:49,131
It doesn't make
any sense at all.

607
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:50,733
Oh, hey.
What?

608
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:52,802
I'm Maggie.
I'm your neighbor.

609
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:55,104
Jason.
I'm Lizzy.

610
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:56,072
[Both]
Nice to meet you.

611
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:58,307
Both of you.

612
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:01,043
I have to get up early so I should probably hit the sack.

613
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,712
Nice to meet you--

614
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:03,913
Maggie.

615
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,553
Jackass.

616
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:12,255
How about a drink?
Would you like a drink?

617
00:48:12,257 --> 00:48:14,190
Yeah.

618
00:48:14,192 --> 00:48:16,559
I have this friend who has this really great winery.

619
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,194
He makes
delicious wine.

620
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:21,397
I think this will
definitely do the trick.

621
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,589
Fucking weird ass doll.

00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:32,101

Lizzy?

626
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:14,677
Lizzy?

627
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:24,120
She says its not her fault,
but nobody believes her.

628
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,689
What's not her fault?

629
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,158
You don't know?

630
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:41,570
[Strange voice]
It's not my fault.

631

00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:53,669
Maggie?

634
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,371
Let's bust open
that basement door

635
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:56,839
you were telling
me about last night.

636
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:01,777
Yeah, just give me
a second to wake up.

637
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:03,679
You got five minutes.

638
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,614
You're not much
for knocking are you?

639
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,075
Wait.
What?

640
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:34,977
I don't know.
Shouldn't we let Jason do this?

641
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:37,713
Why? Because.
What if we fuck something up

642
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,915
and we can't get inside.
Don't worry about it. It will be easy.

643
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:42,718
You just drink your coffee and
let me do all the work, okay?

644
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,719
Okay.

645
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:53,896

[whispers]
Oh, God.

648
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:03,272
All right. One more time.
Okay, let's try.

649
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:04,873
Okay.

650
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:17,086
All right,
should we-- You want to-- No, you.

651

You swing.
You're good.

652

Take and edge and try to pry it.

Yeah, exactly.

It's impossible.

655
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:48,951
All right.
Ready?

00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:53,188

not working, okay?

694
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:26,007
I'm nervous
and I'm anxious

695
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:27,909
and I'm--
I'm having nightmares.

696
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,345
And I'm ruining my relationship with Jason.

697
01:02:30,347 --> 01:02:32,080
Lizzy, I understand.

698
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:34,649
Breathe. Everything
is going to be okay.

699
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:36,151
No, it's not!

700
01:02:36,153 --> 01:02:37,385
Okay, I'm losing
my fucking mind.

701
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:41,089
What?

702
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,991
Why are you looking
at me like that?

703
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:45,060
So what do you
think we should do?

704
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:47,629
I don't know what to do.
That's why I'm paying you.

705
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:49,164
You want me
to tell you what to do?

706
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:51,366
Yes, I want you
to tell me what to do.

707
01:02:51,368 --> 01:02:53,902
I'm not your parent, Lizzy,
and you're no longer a little girl.

708
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:56,271
And I'm not here
to tell you what to do.

709
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:59,775
As a matter of fact,
you know exactly what you have to do.

710
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:02,144
No, I really don't.

711
01:03:02,146 --> 01:03:05,347
The answer to every one of your problems
is right in front of your face, Lizzy.

712
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:08,316
But you've been rejecting it
this entire time.

713
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:11,086
I don't know what
you're talking about, okay?

714
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:14,122
Can't you just give me some
stronger pills or something?

715
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,525
I'm not going
to do that anymore.

716
01:03:16,527 --> 01:03:18,460
What? Why not?

717
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,762
Because pills are not helping you solve your problem.

718
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:23,165
Oh, God.
Do we have to do this right now?

719
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:28,303
I need relief from this shit,
whatever it is.

720
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:30,639
I can't continue
with these sessions.

721
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:32,974
What are you
talking about?

722
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:36,812
Sorry, Lizzy.
This is going to be our last session.

723
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:39,181
I don't--I don't
understand. Why?

724
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,350
I can't help you
fix the present,

725
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:44,886
if you're not willing
to face the past.

726
01:03:44,888 --> 01:03:47,155
Come on.
Are you kidding me?

727
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,491
I can't help you anymore.

728
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:53,562
So let me
get this straight.

729
01:03:53,564 --> 01:03:57,599
You're not going to help me anymore
because I can't face my childhood?

730
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,435
[Whispers]
Oh, my God.

731
01:04:00,437 --> 01:04:02,370
You know,
you don't know everything.

732
01:04:02,372 --> 01:04:04,472
You don't know what it's like to be in my shoes,

733
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:06,775
to lay awake every night,
frozen in fear, until 4:00 A.M.

734
01:04:06,777 --> 01:04:10,478
All you have are your Ivy
League theories and complexes.

735
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,081
You know,
I despise people like that.

736
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:15,083
Thanks for nothing.

737
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:26,995
[Distorted music]

738
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,977
[distorted music continues]

739
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:51,286
I'm sorry.

740
01:04:51,288 --> 01:04:53,255
For what?

741
01:04:53,257 --> 01:04:56,191
For the fight.
We haven't talked for, like, two days.

742
01:04:56,193 --> 01:04:59,394
Yeah.
I'm sorry, too.

743
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:01,062
Are you okay?

744
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:05,734
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

745
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:08,069
I don't know.
You just seem really out of it.

746
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:11,840
Must be tired
or something.

747
01:05:11,842 --> 01:05:14,576
Okay, why don't you
go lay down.

748
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:18,647
You look really exhausted.
All right.

749
01:05:18,649 --> 01:05:21,549
Okay.

750
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:25,587
Hey, I miss you.

751
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,059
I miss you, too.

752
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:54,316
[Distorted growling]

753
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:14,369
Hey, Maggie.
What are you wearing?

754
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:18,473
Oh sweetie, sweetie,
come in. What's wrong?

755
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,842
It's Andrew!

756
01:06:20,844 --> 01:06:21,643
Who's Andrew?

757
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:32,153
[Whispers]
Here, sweetie.

758
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:35,490
All right.
Now tell me what's wrong.

759
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:39,361
I have to come clean to you about
a couple of things, okay? Okay.

760
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:44,466
I know I told you that I lived with my boyfriend

761
01:06:44,468 --> 01:06:48,436
and he just moved out, right? Yeah.

762
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:53,775
Well, my real name
is Bridget

763
01:06:53,777 --> 01:06:57,178
and I'm actually a live-in maid for a family.

764
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:04,052
Andrew is the father, Abby is the mother,
and Lizzy is the daughter.

765
01:07:04,054 --> 01:07:06,654
Okay, that's fine.

766
01:07:06,656 --> 01:07:09,090
What's got you
so upset, Maggie?

767
01:07:09,092 --> 01:07:10,558
Bridget.

768
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:13,528
It's Andrew.

769
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,698
He--
He what?

770
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,200
He, you know...

771
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,504
violated me.

772
01:07:22,506 --> 01:07:24,672
Oh, my God.

773
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:26,107
I'm calling the cops.

774
01:07:26,109 --> 01:07:27,876
No, no, don't.

775
01:07:27,878 --> 01:07:29,711
You don't understand.

776
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,447
You don't understand.

777
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:33,882
Andrew has
a lot of money...

778
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:35,617
and he--
he's protected.

779
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:38,153
That's a bunch of bull.
I'm calling the cops.

780
01:07:38,155 --> 01:07:40,188
Yes, yes, hello.
My name is Lizzy Allen

781
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:43,324
and my friend just told me that she was--

782
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:48,463
Raped!
That she was raped.

783
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:51,933
The address?
What's the address?

784
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:54,369
92 Second Street,
Fall River.

785
01:07:54,371 --> 01:07:57,205
It's 92 Second Street in Fall River.
Please hurry.

786
01:07:57,207 --> 01:08:01,376
What? No, there
must be some mistake.

787
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:05,914
No, 92 Second Street in Fall River.
Please check again.

788
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:09,150
I don't understand.
They're saying there's no such--

789
01:08:09,152 --> 01:08:11,219
Address.

790
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:15,523
Hello?
Hello.

Bridget?

792
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:40,515
Maggie?

793
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,287
Is somebody there?

794
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,667
[Maggie talking]

795
01:08:59,669 --> 01:09:01,636
Maggie, who
are you talking to?

796
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,538
<i>No, Mr. Borden,</i>
<i>please.</i>

797
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,406

are you talking to?

800
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:34,002
Abby cannot bear me a son

801
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:36,704
to take my name
and my fortune.

802
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:40,742
She is barren.

803
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:45,346
She's childless.

804
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:53,621
That's not true,
Mr. Borden.

805
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:57,825
Borden? What?

806
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:07,769
What is true is Lizzie
and her funny ways.

807
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:15,210
Messing around
with other girls.

808
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:20,515
And that brings an embarrassment
to the love in my heart.

what's coming to them....

to give me my son.
