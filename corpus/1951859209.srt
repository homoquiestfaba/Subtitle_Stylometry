1
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:10,427
All those who wish to accept
Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior,

2
00:02:10,427 --> 00:02:14,966
Please, come to the railing
and be comforted.

3
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,495
The Lord be with you.

4
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:53,163
...Like it's the most natural thing
in the world. Nobody looks at me funny.

5
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:55,035
Nobody even gives it a second thought.

6
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,136
I mean, I have this dream all the time.

7
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,541
There's never any sense
of sin or shame in it.

8
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,473
Don't you just love being naked?

9
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,485
Uh, look, I know we just met
and everything

10
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:12,785
but would you like to go out on a date
with me on Saturday night,

11
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:13,915
Norma Jean?.

12
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,117
My uncle,
Ted Lewis is opening a show...

13
00:03:16,117 --> 00:03:17,627
The Ted Lewis?.

14
00:03:17,627 --> 00:03:18,492
Yeah.

15
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:20,565
Ted Lewis is your uncle!?.

16
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,730
Oh wow! God, Eddie, I'd love to go!

17
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,463
Really?.

18
00:03:26,463 --> 00:03:30,235
Yeah! Oh, my heart is beating so fast.

19
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,311
Can you feel it?.

20
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,845
God!

21
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,487
It's like having
our own private swimming pool.

22
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,187
And to think they pay you for this.

23
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:52,790
Yep. Eighty dollars a week just to sit
in that life guard's tower over there.

24
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,997
The best part, by far,

25
00:03:56,997 --> 00:04:00,037
is that Miss Emmeline Snively's
Blue Book

26
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:03,074
Modeling Agency is located right
in the lobby.

27
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,777
Well, I'll tell you a secret,
Mr. Edward Jordon.

28
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,604
I don't intend to be
a bathing suit model

29
00:04:08,604 --> 00:04:10,181
for too much longer.

30
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:13,717
In fact, a year from now,
I'm going to be a very famous actress.

31
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:14,512
Sure, sure, sure.

32
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:17,145
I mean, bigger than Betty Grable
and Jean Harlow put together.

33
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:20,589
I'm going to be so damn famous, Eddie,
nobody'll be able to touch me.

34
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,021
Of course,
my husband has always discouraged me.

35
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,429
He says
there are a thousand beautiful girls

36
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:28,431
in Hollywood who can act

37
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:29,899
and they're all looking for work.

38
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,067
Uh, where is your uh...
husband, Norma Jean?.

39
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:40,377
Over seas - where he belongs.
He was recalled to duty in the Pacific.

40
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,550
Well, he's okay and all but
I don't really feel anything for him.

41
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,311
I suppose I'll have to do something
about it one of these days.

42
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,958
God,
I want this feeling to last forever.

43
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,166
Is everybody happy?.!

44
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,942
Eddie, that's Errol Flynn!

45
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:20,545
Look, over there! He's standing up.
Oh, it is...

46
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:21,442
It's really him.

47
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:23,242
He is so dreamy.

48
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,879
Let me borrow your pen
for a sec, will ya?.

49
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,484
Oh my, that's gotta be Orson Welles!

50
00:06:28,484 --> 00:06:29,212
Where?.

51
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:30,322
Over there, by the exit.

52
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,958
That's not Orson Welles.

53
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:40,122
Eddie, I am having a wonderful time.

54
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,192
And I just love your uncle.

55
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:45,998
He reminds me of you.
He's so commanding.

56
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:47,936
He's so sexy!

57
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,605
Well, he's a great entertainer, sure.

58
00:06:51,605 --> 00:06:52,574
But sexy?.

59
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,836
The man's fifty-eight years old.

60
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,674
You know how you said
you'd introduce me?.

61
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,318
Yeah. The next time he's in the area,
we'll go out on the town.

62
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:01,511
We'll make an evening of it.

63
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,690
Well, why don't we go back stage
and talk to him after the show?.

64
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,349
I just wanna shake his hand.

65
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:08,858
I wanna finally meet a real star, Eddie

66
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:09,791
I don't know, Norma Jean.

67
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,863
I mean, there's usually
a lot of commotion back there.

68
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,090
A lot of weird people hangin' around -

69
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,063
it's not the best way
to get to know someone.

70
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,200
Do I embarrassyou, Eddie?.

71
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,872
God, no. No.

72
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,339
Mr. Lewis, I am so thrilled.

73
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,104
You are my favorite enter-
tainer of all time!

74
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:30,681
And I just wanted to tell you how much

75
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:33,752
I admire you for dancing
with a negro in your act.

76
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,485
I don't know how long you're gonna be
in town, Uncle Ted. But,

77
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,989
I'm in a play at the Cast Theatre.

78
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,590
It's " A wake and Sing,"
by Clifford Odets?.

79
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,454
It's a greatplay. It's very political.

80
00:07:45,454 --> 00:07:46,530
Actually, I got the second lead
and I was wondering

81
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,257
if maybe you could...

82
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:50,733
Sure, Eddie. Sure.
If I have a chance, I'll stop by.

83
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,364
Here you go, kid.

84
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,033
It can be real tough
starting out in show bizz.

85
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,302
Hell, I aughta know.

86
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,272
That's not necessary.

87
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:04,178
Ah, come on.
A big town, a gorgeous girl...

88
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:06,615
You need a little dough
to have a good time.

89
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,586
Am I right, huh?.

90
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,846
Am I right, boychick?.

91
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,354
There.

92
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,560
Is everybody happy?.

93
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,528
You know what, Eddie?.

94
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:29,171
I got my final divorce papers
in the mail today.

95
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,933
I am officially a free woman!

96
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,473
Free, white and twenty-one!

97
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,582
I can't help myself --
I feel like celebrating.

98
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:45,149
Yeah, well... And
then we both got somethin' to celebrate

99
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,254
You're pregnant?.

100
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:52,087
Nope. I have just signed a seven year
optional contract

101
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:55,359
with Twentieth Century Fox!

102
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,226
When were you gonna tell me?.

103
00:08:58,226 --> 00:09:00,804
At dinner. Over a bottle of champagne.

104
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,798
It's up for renewal every six months
at their discretion.

105
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:07,140
Seventy-five dollars a week to start
with but then it keeps climbing, right,

106
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,871
every time they renew.

107
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:10,039
So, if they keep me around
for the full seven years

108
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:13,117
then I'm gonna get somethin'
like fifteen hundred a week.

109
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,081
I mean, Jesus, Can you imagine?.

110
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:16,688
You'll be able to say you knew me when.

111
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,588
Wow, Eddie. That's great.
That's really terrific.

112
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:31,495
Of course the minute I signed

113
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:33,696
that made me eligible to join
the Screen Actor's Guild,

114
00:09:33,696 --> 00:09:35,431
So now I have my SAG card, too.

115
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:37,770
And I'm already up for my first part.

116
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,271
Well, I mean, it's not much of a part,
it's just two lines.

117
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:41,778
But it's a Dana Andrews movie
and I think it could be...

118
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:43,575
Well, fuck your contract, Eddie!

119
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:48,810
Fuck your contract, fuck your SAG card,
fuck Dana Andrews and fuck you, too!

120
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,166
What the hell is the matter with you?.

121
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,705
Let me tell you something.

122
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,042
I don't have a guild card
and I don't have a studio contract

123
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:14,112
but I know
there's only one way to get them - -

124
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:15,577
I'm gonna be in the goddamn movies

125
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:18,149
if I have to fuck Bela Lugosi
to get there!

126
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,411
You know,
you always talk about being an actress

127
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:23,647
but you never done
a goddamn thing about it.

128
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,056
You wanna be an actress?. Okay, so act!

129
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,725
It's work, Norma Jean.

130
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,758
Get into an acting class,
do your scene work,

131
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:32,955
Iearn the craft,
work your way up like I did!

132
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:36,091
Oh, you think girls get movie contracts

133
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:38,226
because somebody respects their talent,
Eddie?.

134
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,232
I'll tell you
how girls get movie contracts,

135
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:42,398
they fuck the right people, that's how.

136
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:44,270
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

137
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,207
And I'm gonna be rich and famous

138
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:50,873
and powerful and you'll be able to say
you knew me when.

139
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,431
Oh, God, Eddie,
I really screwed it up, huh?.

140
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,836
I said some pretty awful things.
God, I'm sorry.

141
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,704
I'm so upset I can't sleep.

142
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,749
You're not really mad at me, are you?.

143
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:26,351
I don't think
I could take it if you were.

144
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,425
Say you're not mad at me... Eddie?.

145
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:39,963
I'm not... really mad at you.
It...It's just that sometimes you're...

146
00:11:39,963 --> 00:11:41,828
you're like, you're like...

147
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,993
What am I like?.

148
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:47,634
I don't know.
You're like two different people.

149
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,205
Both of us love you.

150
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:59,841
Don't just Bitch me, Eddie.
Please, don't. Don't.

151
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:06,791
I won't. I'm not. I uh...

152
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,618
I love you.

153
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,494
Alright, Ladies.

154
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:22,140
Brown and Bigelow have asked us to find
a fresh face for their 1947 calendar.

155
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,844
They want a girl who embodies
the spirit of the post-war woman.

156
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,172
No professional modeling
experience necessary.

157
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,816
The job pays 250 dollars.

158
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:37,618
Your name, please.

159
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:39,452
I'm Adrian Wallingford.

160
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:41,787
And no, I've neverdone any former
modeling before,

161
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:43,394
but I do have work experience.

162
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:44,018
Really?.

163
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:44,891
That's right.

164
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:49,023
I was electrical supervisor at Locheed,
on the Liberator Bomber series.

165
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,261
My unit made...

166
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:52,233
Hi. Oh, I hope I ' m not late.
I ' m Norma Jean Dougherty.

167
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:54,601
From the the Blue Book Modeling Agency?.

168
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,905
I was so afraid I was going to be late.

169
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,139
Could you...

170
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:05,114
Would...Would you mind zipping me up,
please?.

171
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:06,081
Sure.

172
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,420
Thanks. You're sweet.

173
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,792
Would you mind standing under
the light, Miss...

174
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:17,395
Dougherty. Norma Jean Dougherty. Sure.

175
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,764
Is this how you want me?.

176
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,243
Mr. Jasgur usually lets us listen to
Jack Benny when we work Sundays.

177
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:33,402
Great, isn't he?.

178
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,514
We presentthe Jack Benny show
starring Barry Livingston,

179
00:13:38,514 --> 00:13:43,953
Dennis Day Rodchester, and your host...
The one and only... Mr. Jack Benny!

180
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:09,378
Oh, look at that.
Oh, yes. Oh, it's a beauty.

181
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:15,911
Gladys?. Gladys?. Honey?.
You'll find another job real soon.

182
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,650
I hear
they're hiring neg cutters over at PKO.

183
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,824
Leave me alone!!!

184
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,797
Leave me alone!!!

185
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,436
Leave me alone!!!

186
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:42,411
Jesus loves me, this I know,
'cause the Bible tells me so.

187
00:14:42,411 --> 00:14:45,745
Norma Jean?. Norma Jean?.

188
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:51,349
Look at me for a second.
Your mama's sick, honey.

189
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,253
She's going to have to stay
in the hospital a little while.

190
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,387
So how's about you come
and live with Doc and me?.

191
00:14:58,387 --> 00:14:59,963
Juust till she's better.

192
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,931
Why can't I go live with my daddy?.

193
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,566
Do you know about your daddy,
Norma Jean?.

194
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,272
Uh-huh. I have his picture.

195
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,836
His name's Stanely.

196
00:15:10,836 --> 00:15:14,377
Stanely Gifford, and he lives in dairy.

197
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,011
Ma says
he's just about the handsomest man

198
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:19,014
she's ever seen in her life.

199
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:23,583
Ma says if you squint your eyes,
you'd swear he was Clark Gable.

200
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:32,356
And you know that your daddy's very,
very busy right now, don't you?.

201
00:15:32,356 --> 00:15:34,465
Why doesn't he every come to see me?.

202
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,900
He would't have to bring me candy
or toys or anything.

203
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,063
Just come say hello.

204
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,510
Come on now, little lady.

205
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,245
We're gonna have a good ol' time.

206
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:52,006
Just you and me and Gracie.

207
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,316
Come on. Up!

208
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:57,445
What do you say
we go pick up your things?.

209
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:05,529
And then,
what does Harlow say to Ben Lyon?.

210
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:09,657
She says,
"I wanna be free, be gay, have fun!

211
00:16:09,657 --> 00:16:12,930
Life's short,
but I want to live when I'm alive."

212
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,804
And "Dinner at Eight."

213
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,940
What does she say in "Dinner at Eight?. "

214
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,668
Um, to Marie Dresser?.

215
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:21,473
Dress -- ler.

216
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:23,012
She says, "Do you know

217
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:27,016
machinery's going to take the place
of every profession?. "

218
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:32,919
And then, what does Marie Dressler say?.

219
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:37,461
"Oh, my dear, that is something
you need never worry about. "

220
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:42,590
Oh, that is so good. That is perfect!
Just perfect!

221
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,232
Baby, your mama's here.

222
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,102
Can you say hello?.

223
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,646
Gladys?.

224
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,983
Alright, here we go.

225
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,721
Oh, oh...Oh, my God.

226
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:06,449
Easy, Gladys. That's alright.

227
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:07,889
It's alright. It'll be alright.

228
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,393
Now,
we'll just set you down right there.

229
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:12,326
Oh, my back.

230
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:15,456
It's okay. It's okay.

231
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,630
Isn't she pretty, Gladys?.

232
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,967
Tell your mama what'ch you're gonna be
when you're all grown up.

233
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,868
Say, "A movie star, baby."

234
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,309
Tell her you're gonna be a movie star.

235
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,845
Gonna be our own Norma Jean Swanson.

236
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:38,021
Or maybe we'll call you
Norma Jean Stanwick!

237
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:39,350
How'd that be?.

238
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:45,788
Let's face it girls.

239
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:49,799
That wonderful guy in your house
and in mine is building your happiness

240
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:54,199
and the opportunities that
will come to your children.

241
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,641
Split-level homes may be in style,

242
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:01,075
but there is simply no roomfor split-
level thinking.

243
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:06,584
So when my Jimcomes home
from a hard day at the office,

244
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:11,052
our Family Room
brings us closer together...

245
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:13,782
Is there more?.

246
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,793
What was your name again, Miss?.

247
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:18,954
Dougherty. Norma Jean Dougherty.

248
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,823
And who sent you to us, Miss Dougherty?.

249
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,227
The Blue Book Modeling Agency.

250
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,694
Have you ever auditioned
for radio work before?.

251
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,772
No. Not before. No, never. No.

252
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,403
Well, Miss Dougherty,

253
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,877
you are to go back to
the Blue Book Modeling Agency

254
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:39,608
and tell them they should send you out
for print ads, and print ads only.

255
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:40,942
Under no circumstances

256
00:18:40,942 --> 00:18:44,613
should they put you up for any job
that entails reading, speaking,

257
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:48,021
moving or anything
that might vaguely be construded

258
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:53,996
as acting because you do not have even
the slightest aptitude for it.

259
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,839
What?.

260
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,603
Blonde hair photographs better.

261
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:12,673
It can be made to look light, medium,
or dark just by controlling the light.

262
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,315
That's why my biggest demand is
for blondes.

263
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:19,185
If you wanna go places, honey,
you've got to bleach.

264
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:21,258
But Emmeline, it won't look natural.

265
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:23,122
What's so great about natural?.

266
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:25,059
The good Lord spreads it around, child.

267
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:27,062
You've already lost the hair lottery.

268
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,793
It's going to look gorgeous.

269
00:19:32,793 --> 00:19:34,064
You'll see.

270
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,767
You'll feel like a different person.

271
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,706
You know,
some women really look better blonde.

272
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:54,021
There. Now, you just sit there
and relax for a few minutes, okay?.

273
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,989
And I'll...
Would you like something to drink maybe

274
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:58,221
Sure.

275
00:19:58,221 --> 00:20:02,060
I've got some Coke,
or some Tasty Oragne.

276
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,171
You should work at a hospital.

277
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:13,369
Doc's a funny name for a cowboy.

278
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,720
Come on, little lady, let's ride!

279
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,892
Now, this is the way
the gentleman rides:

280
00:20:27,892 --> 00:20:30,756
gallop, gallop, gallop, gallop!

281
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:32,693
And this is the way the lady rides:

282
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:35,823
trot, trot, trot, trot,
trot, trot, trot!

283
00:20:35,823 --> 00:20:43,067
And this is the way the farmer rides:
gallop-deloy, gallop-deloy.

284
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:50,674
Oh! Come on, honey,
give your old Doc a kiiisssss!

285
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,723
My God, you're pretty.

286
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:16,330
No.

287
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,033
Aw, Gracie, honey, we were just playin'

288
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,782
Norma Jean, this is Mrs. Dewey.

289
00:21:33,782 --> 00:21:36,393
She's very nice,
I think you're really gonna like her.

290
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:37,959
But, I'm not an orphan.

291
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,188
Hello, dear.

292
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,221
I...I think it's for the best.

293
00:21:41,221 --> 00:21:42,196
Just for a little while.

294
00:21:42,196 --> 00:21:45,098
Just till Doc
and me can work things out.

295
00:21:45,098 --> 00:21:46,829
Come inside, Norma Jean...

296
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,096
I don't belong here!

297
00:21:49,096 --> 00:21:50,708
Meet the other girls!

298
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,581
Let go of me!

299
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:05,884
Don't leave me! No! Grace!

300
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:13,325
Aunt Grace! Aunt... Ow!

301
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:21,531
Hello?.

302
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:23,538
May I speak to Stanley Gifford, please?.

303
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:24,770
Who's calling?.

304
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,538
This is Miss Norma Jean Baker,
his daughter.

305
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,813
Um...Gladys Baker's girl.

306
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,582
Uh...just a moment.

307
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,187
He doesn't want to speak to you.

308
00:22:37,187 --> 00:22:38,550
He says if you have any questions

309
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,090
you should call his lawyer
in Los Angeles.

310
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,753
I'll give you the number.
Do you have a pencil?.

311
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,275
Bless you! Blesssss you!

312
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,967
I'm Mary Louise Gifford, you...

313
00:22:58,967 --> 00:23:01,375
Your father's wife, your stepmother.

314
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:04,577
I've travelled all the way
from Hemet to beg you --

315
00:23:04,577 --> 00:23:06,411
your father's in the hospital.

316
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:07,609
He's dying.

317
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:12,153
His last wish was to see his daughter
just one time before he meets his maker

318
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,549
Tell him to call my lawyer.

319
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,363
Do you have a pencil?.

320
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,994
Absolutely perfect!

321
00:23:24,994 --> 00:23:27,071
You look like a whole new woman!

322
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:27,095
Hey, Eddie! Eddie,
take it easy over there!

323
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,965
Somebody help him!

324
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:57,627
The two of you dancing together,

325
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,558
you looked like some kind of
burlesque skit!

326
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,195
I'm not seeing him because of
the way he looks, Eddie.

327
00:25:02,195 --> 00:25:03,358
Yeah, no kidding!

328
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,794
So, who the hell is he?.

329
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:06,465
Johnny Hyde.

330
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:07,832
He's a very influential agent.

331
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:10,373
In fact, he's Vice President of
the William Morris Agency.

332
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:12,640
Yeah, I've heard of him.

333
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,075
Johnny's the one
who discovered Lana Turner.

334
00:25:15,075 --> 00:25:17,715
He also repressents Bob Hope
and Rita Hayworth

335
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,011
Not to mention my Uncle Ted.

336
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:21,880
That's right, I didn't know
if you knew that.

337
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,884
Ted's the one who introduced us.

338
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,189
You have been seeing Uncle Ted!?.

339
00:25:29,189 --> 00:25:31,056
Well, sure. When he's in town.

340
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,158
Why are you getting so upset?.

341
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:34,492
Why?. Why?.

342
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,624
Because he's married, that's why!

343
00:25:36,624 --> 00:25:38,929
To my aunt! And I'm gonna kill him!

344
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:41,504
Listen, Eddie,
I don't give a fuck about your uncle.

345
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:44,541
But if he wants to help me out
and all he wants in exchange is for me

346
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:47,406
to spend some time with him,
and to be nice to him.

347
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,038
How nice?. Huh?.

348
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:51,148
Eddie.

349
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,449
You used Uncle Ted
to get to Johnny Hyde.

350
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,854
Oh, who are you to talk?.

351
00:25:57,854 --> 00:25:58,717
Are you trying to tell me

352
00:25:58,717 --> 00:26:00,882
you didn't use your uncle to help you
get your SAG card

353
00:26:00,882 --> 00:26:02,458
and your studio contract?.

354
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,057
Oh, yeah, sure...

355
00:26:04,057 --> 00:26:05,219
He mighta made a couple calls for me.

356
00:26:05,219 --> 00:26:06,853
Yeah,
but I didn't have to sleep with him!

357
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,065
Oh, and I did.

358
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:09,427
So big deal.

359
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,134
Johnny Hyde is going to be
the best thing

360
00:26:11,134 --> 00:26:13,169
that ever happened to mein this town.

361
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,670
I mean, after you. Eddie...

362
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,177
What we have is real.

363
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,610
You know you're the only one I love.

364
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,423
Johnny, I can't believe

365
00:26:41,423 --> 00:26:43,500
I just saw Eleanor Powell
and Loretta Young!

366
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:44,396
I'm having lunch

367
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:46,299
next to the most famous stars
in Hollywood!

368
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,165
Well, baby, you're gonna be bigger
than all of 'em put together.

369
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,134
Ah, thank you.

370
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,606
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Mmmm.

371
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,913
Who's that?.

372
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,189
The goyish-looking one is Darryl Zanuck

373
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,850
he's chief of production at Fox.

374
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,587
Started off as a writer
at Warner Brothers,

375
00:27:11,587 --> 00:27:13,357
used to write Rin Tin Tin movies.

376
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:17,126
And the Greek guy sitting
next to him, that's Spyros Skouras.

377
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,867
He's out here from New York.

378
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,033
He's the chairman of the Board at Fox.

379
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,964
So, this guy grew up
in a little village in Greece,

380
00:27:23,964 --> 00:27:27,135
his family raised sheep
and now he's Zanuck's boss.

381
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,040
So what we have hear
is a guy who used write

382
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,549
for a German Shepherd sucking up
to a guy who used to be a shepherd.

383
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,013
See, everybody's beholden
to somebody else.

384
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,653
Don't ever forget that.

385
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,185
Can I meet them?.

386
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,620
You listen to me.
Right now, you're the mystery woman.

387
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,424
You see, everybody in this room
is dying to know who you are.

388
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,959
And I want to keep it exactly like that

389
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,128
So just trust me.

390
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:55,728
I do. You know I trust you, Johnny.

391
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,635
You're the finest man I ever met.

392
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:04,740
Well...I have ulterior motives.

393
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,574
So do I.

394
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:18,923
What are those?.

395
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,364
Nembutals.

396
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,036
Can't seem to get to sleep
without them anymore.

397
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,272
And these are Benzedrine.

398
00:28:28,272 --> 00:28:30,033
One to go up and one to go down.

399
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,509
I hope your doctor knows
what he's doin'.

400
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:34,305
That stuff's really dangerous.

401
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,211
Actually, your uncle sends them to me.

402
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:42,714
You're crazy! You wanna kill yourself?.

403
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,885
I know what I'm doing,
and I know exactly what I need.

404
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,386
You're just gonna
have to take me the way I am, Eddie.

405
00:28:49,386 --> 00:28:51,620
Take me the way I am
or don't take me at all.

406
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,100
Most of the gals who pose
for us are actresses or models.

407
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,725
Usually the don't like to give
their real name.

408
00:28:58,725 --> 00:29:00,565
So you can make up any name you like.

409
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,739
How about Margaret Tuman?.

410
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,573
Or what about Judy Garland?.

411
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,616
Oh, honey, I could tell you stories,
believe me.

412
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,948
Okay, Norma Jean. Get ready.

413
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,917
Great. Mmm, good.
Very good.

414
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,460
Okay, here we go.
Get in position. Yes. Oohhh.

415
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,932
I like that. Oh, beautiful.
Right in the camera.

416
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,094
And...

417
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,698
Yeah.
Nice.

418
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,815
This girl's gonna be a major star,
Darryl.

419
00:29:54,815 --> 00:29:56,756
Just look at these fairways, will you?.

420
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,562
Like velvet and right
in the middle of the desert.

421
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,262
Hillcrest is a goat track compared
to this place.

422
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:04,368
I'll tell you something,
she has real flesh appeal.

423
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,027
Oh, yeah?.

424
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,377
I promise you,

425
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,640
you haven't seen anything
like this since Harlow.

426
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,452
Harlow was never Miss September.

427
00:30:22,452 --> 00:30:23,519
Yeah but...

428
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,451
Has she got any film on her?.

429
00:30:24,451 --> 00:30:26,386
Not until you authorize the screen test

430
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,761
Eh. Will you look at that!

431
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,136
On in one and then I three putt!

432
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,567
Hmmm. Daryll, I understand that

433
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:47,337
Henry Hathaway needs more prep time
on "Northside 777."

434
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,842
Actually I could call Jimmy Stewart

435
00:30:49,842 --> 00:30:52,279
and get him to agree to
a two week delay.

436
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,882
It won't cost you a nickel.

437
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,177
Alriught, Johnny.

438
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,550
Shoot your screen test --
black and white.

439
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,057
Color.

440
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,754
Deal.

441
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:19,133
Johnny?. They called me at Hillcrest.

442
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,842
I came as soon as I heard...Johnny?.

443
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,241
I'd be lost without you, Johnny.

444
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,176
You have to get better.

445
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,646
You have to.

446
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,053
Besides, I know what you need.

447
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:31,612
What?.

448
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:38,727
This.

449
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,993
Oh. Come here.

450
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:48,168
Johnny?.

451
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,498
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

452
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,290
I've fallen for her, Mozelle.

453
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,154
Oh, Johnny,
you've fallen for every blonde starlet

454
00:32:09,154 --> 00:32:11,524
you've ever represented, including me.

455
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,357
But you've never made a fool
of yourself like this before.

456
00:32:15,357 --> 00:32:17,900
The entire Morris office
is talking about it.

457
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,833
Abe Lastfogel says
you act like she's your only client!

458
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,872
So, is this going to be
some kind of ongoing thing?.

459
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,641
I'm sorry, Mozelle.

460
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:37,150
I love her. I want to marry her.

461
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,789
Well, maybe she'll let you.

462
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,691
She's ambitious enough.

463
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,192
But she doesn't love you, Johnny.

464
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,387
I don't care.

465
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,329
Then you deserve each-other!

466
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,035
She's a bimbo, John.

467
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,240
She's a one-line telephone operator...

468
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,102
She's a walk-away funny waitress.

469
00:33:34,102 --> 00:33:36,236
Come on, Darryl,
you've been wrong before.

470
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:37,748
Who hasn't?.

471
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,680
She's a star.

472
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,581
From the neck down she's a star,

473
00:33:42,581 --> 00:33:44,551
but the girl has no chin to speak of.

474
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,957
She's got a nose like a baked potato.

475
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,456
Let's have a blade.

476
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,641
After this, we redefine the chin,
you'll hardly recognize yourself.

477
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,906
All contract players
at Twentieth Century Fox

478
00:34:08,906 --> 00:34:11,607
are required to study
at the actor's lab Monday,

479
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,407
Wednesday and Friday mornings.

480
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,482
You'll need a singing coach.

481
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,553
You'll be paid
seventy-five dollars per week.

482
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,017
I know. I know.

483
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,819
Then let's start with your name.

484
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:26,997
"Norma Jean Dougherty"
is not a movie star name,

485
00:34:26,997 --> 00:34:28,564
and that is the sad fact of it...

486
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,832
You remind me of someone.

487
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,335
Ever hear of Marilyn Miller?.

488
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,099
No.

489
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,867
She was a great musical comedy star
on Broadway in the 20's.

490
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:45,639
Funny...Sexy as hell.

491
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,513
God, I was crazy about her.

492
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,053
Marilyn Dougherty?.

493
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,656
What do you like?.

494
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:58,089
Any-one you particularly admire?.

495
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,329
How about Lincoln?.

496
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,592
Too many "lins."

497
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,231
Besides it should be a literative.

498
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,400
Maybe we should stay
with American Presidents...

499
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,166
Marilyn Madison?.

500
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:11,639
Mmmmm, no.

501
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,546
"Marilyn Monroe."

502
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,073
Has a nice round tone to it.

503
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,214
What do you think?.

504
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,762
Norma Jean?.

505
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,027
Who?.

506
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,765
Then long live Marilyn Monroe!

507
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,970
You never really loved me.

508
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,745
You just thought it would be fun
to be in love with me, that's all.

509
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:59,088
It's true... Torvald.

510
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,722
Um, when I lived at home with Papa,

511
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:06,260
he always told me
what he thought about everything.

512
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,626
So I never had any ideas of my own.

513
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,392
Oh, dear. No. No, no, no, no, no.

514
00:36:12,392 --> 00:36:14,505
What comes next?. Um...

515
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,770
You never really loved me Orville...

516
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,651
Oh, I'm sorry.

517
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:33,980
I didn't mean to...I'm...I'm...

518
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,855
I don't belong here. I'm...I'm sorry.

519
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,551
You okay, Norma Jean?.

520
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,490
Don't call me that. I'm Marilyn.

521
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,023
Look, it's alright.

522
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,996
Everybody's gone, you can come out now.

523
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,178
Oh, god, I was hathetic out there.

524
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,949
Everybody else has talent,
it's easy for them.

525
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,048
Oh, you're wrong, okay?.
It's not easy for anybody.

526
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,217
But, they can all get up there
and do it, Eddie.

527
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,958
They can all get up there and perform,
same as you can.

528
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:44,488
I'll never be an actress.

529
00:37:44,488 --> 00:37:46,630
No, listen.
All you need is some coaching.

530
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:50,731
Okay?. Every time you perform
you're gonna improve.

531
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,829
I'll work with you.
We can rehearse together.

532
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:55,302
We'll do scenes together.

533
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,838
You're great!

534
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,437
You're gonna be great.

535
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,311
Promise?.

536
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:05,807
Guarantee it.

537
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:14,982
Mmmm. Hey! I bet Johnny knows
all the best coaches in town!

538
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,726
Diction! Diction! Diction!

539
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,933
You speak with your mouth closed!

540
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:30,270
I-did-not-want-to-pet-the-dear-soft-cat

541
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:36,045
I didn't want to pet the quick...
I ' m sorr--

542
00:38:36,045 --> 00:38:37,408
Oh, it's not it, is it?.

543
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:41,176
You have to know your lines backwards
and forwards

544
00:38:41,176 --> 00:38:44,516
so you can throw away the words
and speak the soul!

545
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:49,453
If you arrive on the set unprepared,
you are guaranteed to fail!

546
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,555
And if you fail, I will be crucified.

547
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:56,929
I'm sorry, Natasha.

548
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:10,437
I am trying to love you, but sometimes
you make it so difficult.

549
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,780
You don't have to love me, Natasha.

550
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:14,883
Just teach me.

551
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:18,546
When you left you broke my heart.

552
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,716
Because I never thought we'd part.

553
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:28,790
Every hour in the day,
you will hear me say,

554
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,226
"Baby won't you please come home?. "

555
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,329
Your vocal range is tiny,

556
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:38,033
your volume is small
and your phrasing is...is trite.

557
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:43,378
Altogether it's pretty terrible.
But not hopeless.

558
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,141
Is isn't?.

559
00:39:45,141 --> 00:39:47,978
No. You can... You can carry a tune.

560
00:39:47,978 --> 00:39:50,246
Not...
not very far but you can carry one.

561
00:39:50,246 --> 00:39:52,912
And the sound engineers can bring up
your volume when you record.

562
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:55,116
And you do manage to create
the illusion that

563
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:58,160
you actually know how to sing.

564
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,255
I do?.

565
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,696
Yes. Uh...

566
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,369
So, let's take the last verse again.

567
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:10,338
Try and slow it down a little bit,
alright?.

568
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:11,903
Play with the rhythms.

569
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,473
Like this...Uh...

570
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:21,677
"Every hour in the day,
you will hear me say Baaaabeeee,

571
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:28,320
won't you pul-eeze come hommmmme?. "

572
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:32,326
It's...it's uh...It's called phrasing.

573
00:40:32,326 --> 00:40:33,930
Have some fun with it Alright?.

574
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,799
Got it?.

575
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:45,903
"When you left you broke my he-art.

576
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:50,371
Because I never thought we'd part.

577
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:58,011
Every hour in the day,
you will hear me say...Baby! "

578
00:40:58,011 --> 00:40:59,144
Big finish now.

579
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:05,925
"Won't you pleeease...come..."

580
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,666
You um...

581
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:16,634
You move well.

582
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:26,346
This is the allegro vivace.
Can you hear it?.

583
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:35,385
It comes very gently, but it builds...
and it builds...

584
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,134
Good morning.

585
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:58,804
Hi.

586
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,375
Well, how was the concert?.

587
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,481
Inspiring.

588
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,921
I waited up all night for you.

589
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,817
Oh, no, Johnny. You need your rest.

590
00:42:10,817 --> 00:42:12,121
I'll get my rest when I'm dead,

591
00:42:12,121 --> 00:42:14,993
which is gonna be sooner rather
than later. You know that, Marilyn.

592
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,626
I don't want to hear that kinda talk,
I won't listen!

593
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:19,762
How can yoiu be so cruel?.

594
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:24,769
Becuaes you let me.
I'm going upstairs. You coming?.

595
00:42:24,769 --> 00:42:27,070
Marry me, baby. I'm crazzy about you.

596
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:30,811
I know you are, Johnny.

597
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,916
I wish I could feel
the same way about you.

598
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,717
I mean, I love you,
but I've never been in love with you.

599
00:42:39,717 --> 00:42:41,016
I never said I was.

600
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,888
Yeah, but millions of women marry men
they're not in love with.

601
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:47,288
Millions?. Really?.

602
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,266
I had no idea.
Is that just counting L.A.?.

603
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:53,867
No, don't joke with me, Marilyn.

604
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,233
Now marriage is based
on a lot of other things,

605
00:42:58,233 --> 00:43:01,139
you know, it can be based
on mutual repspect, trust.

606
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,882
That wouldn't be fair to you, Johnny

607
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:14,349
Besides, I'd be even more of a joke
than I am right now.

608
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,686
Good night, Johnny.

609
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,029
Good night.

610
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,166
Ah, feeling better, my dear?.

611
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:31,763
Sure. Just like the English Ch...

612
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,368
Oh, no. Not again!

613
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:35,870
Cut!

614
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:37,110
I'm sorry.

615
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,414
Alright, we'll try it again after lunch

616
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:43,114
After lunch everybody!

617
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,612
Ah, thank you, dear.

618
00:43:45,612 --> 00:43:46,687
Miss Davis, would you mind

619
00:43:46,687 --> 00:43:49,088
if I got some publicity stills
before lunch?.

620
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:50,485
Not at all.

621
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,755
Um, Miss Davis?.
I just wanted to say that

622
00:43:53,755 --> 00:43:56,957
I think I'm screwing up out ofnerves -
working with you and all.

623
00:43:57,234 --> 00:44:00,260
I uh, mean I've seen all of your movies
and I think you're such a talent.

624
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,928
I mean, I must have seen
"Now Voyager" at least ten times.

625
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,265
And when I was a kid I...

626
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:09,102
I remember going with
my Aunt Grace to see "Jezebel."

627
00:44:09,102 --> 00:44:10,873
I musta seen that movie a dozen times,

628
00:44:10,873 --> 00:44:13,381
and afterwards I 'd go home
and I 'd do all of your monologues.

629
00:44:13,381 --> 00:44:15,542
I mean, not as well as you did them,
of course, but...

630
00:44:15,542 --> 00:44:18,086
I mean,
I knew all of your lines by heart.

631
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:19,613
What I mean to say is,

632
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:22,248
it's just an honor
to be on the same set with you.

633
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:23,686
Thank you, dear.

634
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,460
Now get the fuck out of my shot.

635
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:30,257
I don't know where I ever got the idea
I could turn you into an actress.

636
00:44:30,257 --> 00:44:31,129
You don't have it.

637
00:44:31,129 --> 00:44:33,793
You'll never have it.
Who the hell was I kidding?.

638
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:56,285
You know,
I've mae up hundreds of actresses

639
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:00,560
but I've never experienced
a metamorphosis quite like yours.

640
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,164
I gotta tell you,
I get goose bumps every time.

641
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:11,771
Go get 'em, kid.

642
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,547
Gentlemen,
in just a few moments Miss Baxter

643
00:45:52,547 --> 00:45:54,742
will be available
for photo-graphs outside the...

644
00:45:54,742 --> 00:45:56,819
Hey, what's the name
of the chest that just walked in?.

645
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:59,687
Now, listen to me, Darryl.

646
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:03,958
I want you to consider using her
for "Blondes." I hear she sings.

647
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:06,187
Sings?. She barely speaks.

648
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:10,925
No, we've decided to go
with an established musical performer.

649
00:46:10,925 --> 00:46:12,329
What?. Opposite Jane Russel?.

650
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:13,902
She ain't exactly Ethel Merman, y'know.

651
00:46:13,902 --> 00:46:18,599
Skouras,
this girl's talent is...slight.

652
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,306
Then how come she gets four thousand
fan letters a week?.

653
00:46:21,306 --> 00:46:23,242
That's more than Darnell
and Hayward together.

654
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:24,779
How come she's on the screen
for two minutes,

655
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:27,110
the audience stages a riot
in te theatre?.

656
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,152
And how come we put on
a test screening of "All About Eve,"

657
00:46:30,152 --> 00:46:31,845
she doesn't even get a screen credit --

658
00:46:31,845 --> 00:46:34,787
we get three hundred comment cards back
one hundred and fifty of

659
00:46:34,787 --> 00:46:37,951
them wanted to know who is the blonde
with George Sanders.

660
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:39,323
Tell me, how come?.

661
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:43,296
Sweetheart?. Darling?.
Sweetheart, over here.

662
00:46:43,296 --> 00:46:45,333
No, no. Over here. Come sit next to me.

663
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:46,561
Don't do this.

664
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,201
Take a walk, kid. Amscray!

665
00:46:48,201 --> 00:46:49,305
Yes, sir. Right away.

666
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,172
Oh, you look magnificent this evening.

667
00:46:53,172 --> 00:46:54,208
Thank you.

668
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,775
Doll, do you have a picture comin' up?.

669
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:01,545
Why, I don't know.
You'll have to ask Mr. Skouras here.

670
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:04,720
How about a big smile?.

671
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,622
Well, I mean, I think
it's time for us to renegotiate.

672
00:47:14,622 --> 00:47:16,858
Yeah, well, Russel's getting a $ 100,000

673
00:47:16,858 --> 00:47:18,797
and we're still capped off
at five hundred a week.

674
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:21,662
Yeah, but Jane Russel's
a well known star

675
00:47:21,662 --> 00:47:23,295
with an established track record.

676
00:47:23,295 --> 00:47:25,340
Well, maybe so,
but the name of the picture is

677
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,911
"Gentlemen prefer Blondes"
and she is definitely not the blonde.

678
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,611
So, we want a large dressing room with

679
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:36,182
Donna, get Dr. Prinzmetal...
What was that?.

680
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:39,411
Hey, what's going on?.

681
00:47:39,411 --> 00:47:41,888
Johnny?. Johnny?.

682
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:57,470
Oh, Johnny.
Johnny, Johnny, please wake up. Please.

683
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,236
Told you she was a lousy actress.

684
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:07,310
I want you to go to his house,
round up all her slutty clothes,

685
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,544
dump 'em in the backyard
and light a match.

686
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:12,717
Then call someone
and have all the locks changed.

687
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,691
But first, get her outta here,
I don't care if you have to drag her.

688
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,466
We're just like a little family now.
Aren't we, Natasha?.

689
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:42,116
But what if I don't want it to be over.

690
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,149
I'm in love with you, Fred.

691
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:49,815
You cry too easily.
It's because your brain isn't developed

692
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:52,723
Compared to your bosom, it's embryonic.

693
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,120
What does that mean?.

694
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,323
Look it up!

695
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,734
You mind is...is inert.

696
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,198
You never think about anything.

697
00:49:03,198 --> 00:49:07,140
You just float through life
on that pair of waterwings.

698
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,438
You would be a terrible example
for my children.

699
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:12,877
It wouldn't be right for them
to be raised by a woman like you.

700
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,979
But you're the only man I've ever loved

701
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,686
Well, Marilyn,
given your extensive history,

702
00:49:19,686 --> 00:49:21,188
I'm sorry to heart that.

703
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,561
Was I supposed to love you?.

704
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,425
A man can't love a woman
he feels no respect for!

705
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:38,132
Freddy!

706
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,609
You couldn't handle a family
if you had one.

707
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,341
And raise children?. Forget it!

708
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:52,681
You can barely drag your ass out of bed
and make it to the set before noon.

709
00:49:52,681 --> 00:49:53,482
Shut up.

710
00:49:53,482 --> 00:49:55,591
What makes you think you're fit
to be any-body's mother?.

711
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:59,328
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

712
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,387
No man will ever love me, Johnny.

713
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,589
You're wrong, kid.

714
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:14,665
Once you learn to harness your power,
every man in the world will adore you

715
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,771
Just not the ones
who know you personally.

716
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:32,348
Marilyn?. Marilyn?. Marilyn?. Marilyn?.
Marilyn?. Marilyn?. Over here.

717
00:51:32,348 --> 00:51:35,856
Marilyn?. Marilyn?. Marilyn?.
Marilyn?. Marilyn?.

718
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:42,959
Marilyn?. Marilyn!?. Marilyn!?.

719
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,229
Marilyn?. What have you done?.

720
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:50,131
Oh, you foolish, foolish girl!

721
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:00,040
Oh, I am far too old for this.

722
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:05,785
I guess that's why she really needs
someone like I to educate her.

723
00:52:05,785 --> 00:52:07,355
They are coarsening you.

724
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,725
They are making you into a buffoon!

725
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:13,120
It repudiates all the fine work
we have done together.

726
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,661
It's a famous play, Natasha.

727
00:52:15,661 --> 00:52:18,029
Carol Channing originated
the role on Broadway.

728
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,202
Lorelei Lee is a great part.

729
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:24,863
Medea is a great part!
Lorelei Lee is a vacuous moron!

730
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,005
You are an actress!

731
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:30,171
You should be playing Gretchen
in "Faustus."

732
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,812
You should be playing Portia.

733
00:52:32,812 --> 00:52:34,644
You should be playing Ophelia...

734
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,313
No, I refuse to set foot on the lot.

735
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:40,251
I will not be party to this profanity!

736
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,555
Oh, please. Please, Natasha.

737
00:52:44,555 --> 00:52:45,922
Please don't speak that way.

738
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:50,697
I do. I do want to play
those roles someday, and Grushenka, too

739
00:52:50,697 --> 00:52:54,361
Gru-shenka.
Accent on the first syllable, please.

740
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,466
I have to be more established first.

741
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,342
I'm so scared.

742
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,607
You don't know how scared I am.

743
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,439
I have these voices in my head
and some days

744
00:53:05,439 --> 00:53:07,447
I feel like I'm about to explode.

745
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:14,352
I can't do it without you.
I need you to be there.

746
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,266
I'll do anything you want.

747
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:34,176
Just tell me.
Tell me what you want me to do.

748
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:42,314
Don't you know that a man being rich
is like a girl being pretty?.

749
00:53:42,314 --> 00:53:44,943
You might not want to marry a girl
just because she was pretty,

750
00:53:44,943 --> 00:53:46,817
but my goodness, doesn't it help?.

751
00:53:46,817 --> 00:53:49,323
And if your daughter wanted to marry
a poor man...

752
00:53:49,323 --> 00:53:50,926
Cut!!!

753
00:53:50,926 --> 00:53:52,083
What?.

754
00:53:55,765 --> 00:54:00,361
No, no, no. You don't yell cut
because you are not the director.

755
00:54:00,361 --> 00:54:01,936
She botched the line.

756
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:03,434
And do not take that tone with me,

757
00:54:03,434 --> 00:54:06,474
Mr. Hawks, I studied with Reinhardt!

758
00:54:06,474 --> 00:54:09,135
Really?. Well you must of flunked.

759
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:12,804
I want you off my set
and don't come back.

760
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,945
Howard, if she isn't here,
then neither am I.

761
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:19,780
You know,
maybe that's not such a bad idea.

762
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,984
I know a hundred actresses
who could play this part.

763
00:54:22,984 --> 00:54:25,526
Every single one of
them would shoe up on time,

764
00:54:25,526 --> 00:54:31,157
know her lines and sing, dance and
act a damn sight better than you can.

765
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,641
Now look what you have done.

766
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:51,012
Well, there are no broken bones,

767
00:54:51,012 --> 00:54:53,816
but she needs to stay off her feet
for several days.

768
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,781
How many days?.

769
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:58,519
Don't... Don't it hurts.

770
00:54:58,519 --> 00:54:59,788
Can you do something?.

771
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,992
I can give her something that' ll help,
sure.

772
00:55:03,992 --> 00:55:07,136
Oh, please. Please.

773
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,247
So where is she?. It's eight thirty.

774
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:44,021
Marilyn sometimes runs
a little late, Joe.

775
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:45,721
Two hours!?.

776
00:57:45,721 --> 00:57:48,330
It takes a lot of work to look like
Marilyn Monroe --

777
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:50,456
even if you are Marilyn Monroe.

778
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:07,713
And speak of the devil!

779
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,679
You look terrific, honey.

780
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:11,679
Thank you.

781
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:13,522
Say hello to Joe DiMaggio.

782
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:16,691
How do you do, Mr. DiMaggio?.

783
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:19,119
It's always a pleasure to meet one of
David's friends.

784
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:20,923
He's the best publicist in town.

785
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:22,526
Well...

786
00:58:22,526 --> 00:58:25,429
So, are yoou in show business, too?.

787
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:28,726
Marilyn, you're kidding?.

788
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:32,098
He's only the greatest baseball player
since the Babe.

789
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,936
Oh...Who's the Babe?.

790
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:43,347
What a kidder.

791
00:58:43,347 --> 00:58:44,384
Huh. Joe?.

792
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,650
Uh...Gee, Sil...Look at the time.

793
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:48,313
Um...You know, we're gonna leave you
two kids alone.

794
00:58:48,313 --> 00:58:49,390
Get acquainted, okay?.

795
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:51,323
And uh, don't worry about the check,
alright?.

796
00:58:51,323 --> 00:58:52,587
It's all taken care of.

797
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,194
Uh, the Veal Marsala's great,
by the way. Enjoy!

798
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,010
Cheers.

799
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:13,376
Cheers.

800
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:24,889
Oh, this guy's elec-trifying.
Does he speak?.

801
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:30,192
I'm afraid I don't know
very much about baseball.

802
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:31,459
Well, you wear baggy pants,

803
00:59:31,459 --> 00:59:34,570
chew tobacco and hit a ball
with a stick, okay?.

804
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:36,134
Marry me.

805
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,902
I'll teach you all about it.

806
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:41,372
You just met her three minutes ago,
you moron.

807
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:44,541
Why, Mr. DiMaggio,
I've only just met you.

808
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:48,481
Well, in that case,
have dinner with me tomorrow night.

809
00:59:48,481 --> 00:59:51,052
Well, why don't we start
with dinner tonight, Joe?.

810
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,217
Surely you cannot be serious
about this person.

811
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:02,295
I am certain he has never read a book
in his entire life!

812
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:07,663
Joe is very sweet, Natasha.

813
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:09,432
He makes me feel safe.

814
01:00:09,432 --> 01:00:10,869
He takes care of me.

815
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:13,038
And he's very good with his hands.

816
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,808
I take care of you!

817
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:20,439
Natasha...sometimes you sound just like
a jealous boyfriend.

818
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:29,856
Mrs. DiMaggio, where will you live?.

819
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:31,492
Anywhere my husband wants.

820
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:33,285
Marriage is my main career now.

821
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:36,588
Ohh-ho-ho. Are you planning a family?.

822
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:40,563
Of course. Manhood means many things
but womenhood means only one.

823
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,033
I'd love to have six children,
God willing.

824
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:46,333
I won't let you ruin us, Marilyn!
You can't do this!

825
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,173
Will you keep house for your husband?.

826
01:00:50,173 --> 01:00:52,110
She's a movie star!

827
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,014
I'm looking forward to it.

828
01:00:54,014 --> 01:00:56,141
I'm learning how to cook all of
Joe's favorite foods,

829
01:00:56,141 --> 01:00:59,516
Iike steak and lasagna. Right?.

830
01:00:59,516 --> 01:01:05,617
No! No! No! No! No! Noooo!

831
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:31,653
Well, I can see
you have a real aptitude for this.

832
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:34,219
You're a regular Mama Leone.

833
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:37,885
Cannot wait to watch you scrub
the toilet bowl.

834
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:56,275
Oh, will you lookit fuckin' Woodling?.

835
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:57,943
He's dumb as an Irish Setter!

836
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,210
He can catch a ball
like a frog zappin' a fly,

837
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:02,544
after he got it,
he don't know what to do with it.

838
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:04,610
Rookie's Lefty.

839
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:12,553
Are you crazy?.

840
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:14,889
We're tryin' to watch a ball game here!

841
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,759
Hey! Hey!

842
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:26,866
Here comes the Neanderthal.

843
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,138
Hey Joe, you gotta see this!

844
01:02:29,138 --> 01:02:30,677
Rizzuto just took
a line drive to the nuts!

845
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:33,443
What's wrong, Marilyn?.

846
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,181
What could possibly be wrong?.

847
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:40,612
You are burying us alive,

848
01:02:40,612 --> 01:02:43,953
that's what's wrong! We are cooped up
in this house all day watching

849
01:02:43,953 --> 01:02:46,152
"Hopalong Cassidy"
and "Father Knows Best."

850
01:02:46,152 --> 01:02:47,853
You don't even talk to us!

851
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,928
All you care about is hanging out
with your dimwit pals,

852
01:02:49,928 --> 01:02:53,866
sitting around burping and farting
and scratching their balls!

853
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,701
Are you sure you're okay?.

854
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,900
Of course we're not okay, you blockhead

855
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:02,802
We need some room to breath!

856
01:03:02,802 --> 01:03:04,344
We need to work!

857
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,415
We need to feel the crowds and the fans

858
01:03:07,415 --> 01:03:09,780
and we need to be in a city
with a pulse!

859
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:15,013
I'm fine.

860
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:24,525
Okay. Good. Listen, uh,
just forget about the lasagna.

861
01:03:24,525 --> 01:03:26,464
Just make some spaghetti, okay?.

862
01:03:26,464 --> 01:03:27,694
The fellahs are hungry.

863
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:39,708
Lunch is served!

864
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,032
Alright. Marilyn, Tom... All set?.

865
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:02,394
Now, darling Marilyn,
when you get to the...

866
01:04:02,394 --> 01:04:03,698
What you call it?. Crating...

867
01:04:03,698 --> 01:04:05,671
Watch it with your heel. Alright?.

868
01:04:05,671 --> 01:04:07,002
And roll sound!

869
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,367
Rolling!

870
01:04:08,367 --> 01:04:09,739
Mark it.

871
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,314
And...action!

872
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,828
You know... The sense of being in love.

873
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,863
That's a very interesting point of view.

874
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:37,505
Oh, do you feel the breeze
from the subway?.

875
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,031
Oh...

876
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,330
Marilyn! Marilyn!

877
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,620
Billy?. Billy?.

878
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:30,650
What is it?.

879
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:31,885
Um, I don't know... The...

880
01:05:31,885 --> 01:05:34,496
The panties are really sheer.

881
01:05:34,496 --> 01:05:38,259
Even up on the crane I could still see
the dark pubes.

882
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:40,497
Jesus.

883
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:44,431
Marjorie. Marjorie?. Please.

884
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:49,403
Eh, could we put another pair
of panties over those panties?.

885
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:50,636
Thank you.

886
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:52,674
In the space of a single day,

887
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:57,842
I believe we have increased Marilyn's
wardrobe of underthings by 200 percent.

888
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:08,829
Joe, Joe. Hey, what do you think of
Marilyn showin' off...

889
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:15,962
I had no idea they didn't renew
your contract.

890
01:06:15,962 --> 01:06:17,697
What a lousy break.

891
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:22,033
Yep. I've been thinkin' about
gettin' back to the city for awhile now

892
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:26,311
and try my hand at Broadway --
where they appreciate real talent.

893
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,548
Hey, am I distrubing you, Marilyn?.

894
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:33,979
Do you realize that
you haven't taken your eyes off

895
01:06:33,979 --> 01:06:36,216
your goddamn reflection since
I've been here?.

896
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,317
Well, gee, Eddie,
I hate to break it to you,

897
01:06:38,317 --> 01:06:40,326
but what do you think actresses do
in their dressing rooms?.

898
01:06:40,326 --> 01:06:41,054
I don't know.

899
01:06:41,054 --> 01:06:43,631
I guess it depends
on how self-absorbed they are.

900
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:46,159
He's back?. The life-guard?.

901
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:48,064
Don't let him insult you like that.

902
01:06:48,064 --> 01:06:49,671
Get out of here.

903
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:51,964
Sure. I was just leaving.

904
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:54,433
No, no! Not you, Eddie.

905
01:06:54,433 --> 01:06:57,078
It was just a line that
I was working on.

906
01:06:57,078 --> 01:06:59,180
Could you please sit down?. I'm sorry.

907
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:00,371
Please.

908
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:08,086
Well, you delivered it well.

909
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,090
Like he would know?.

910
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:22,532
You know, sometimes I have to look
in the mirror to see who's there.

911
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:23,761
Know what I mean?.

912
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:25,934
Nope.

913
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,454
Much better.

914
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:51,766
I see you're mixin' booze
with your downers now, huh?.

915
01:07:51,766 --> 01:07:53,630
What booze, Eddie?. It's Champagne.

916
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:56,236
It's still booze
and the combination can kill you.

917
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,268
What?. You're gonna lecture me now?.

918
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,001
Am I...Am I the only person
that tells you this stuff?.

919
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,146
What about your husband, huh?.

920
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:08,309
And what about your...
Your...Your friends?.

921
01:08:08,309 --> 01:08:10,817
I mean, for chrissake,
don't you have any friends?.

922
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:15,120
Well, of course I have friends,
Eddie. Ha!

923
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:17,758
But see these here are my best friends.

924
01:08:17,758 --> 01:08:19,758
They're the only ones
who are completely loyal.

925
01:08:19,758 --> 01:08:20,953
The only ones
that never try to change me.

926
01:08:20,953 --> 01:08:24,430
They shake me see, and some-times
they get very nasty and they yell,

927
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:26,762
"Hey, bitch! Get the fuck outta bed! "

928
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:32,668
Oh, yes. Sometimes,

929
01:08:32,668 --> 01:08:36,209
when I feel my clock running down
and I'm dead on my feet

930
01:08:36,209 --> 01:08:38,609
and I can't dance another step,

931
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:46,678
the run all over my body
and turn all my switches back on..

932
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,081
They make me alive again.

933
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:02,397
The way they lined up to see me
in New York.

934
01:09:02,397 --> 01:09:03,835
Don't let it go to your head.

935
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:07,173
The same folks line up to see
the fat lady and the two headed calf.

936
01:09:07,173 --> 01:09:08,367
They love a good freak show.

937
01:09:08,367 --> 01:09:09,773
You seemed to enjoy it.

938
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:13,041
You think I'm fat?.

939
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:15,412
You're a little prky around the middle
if you want to know.

940
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,175
I didn't ask.

941
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,115
You know, Zanuck says he thinks

942
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:22,224
"The Seven Year Itch"
is gonna make him a bundle.

943
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:24,253
He says it's my best role ever.

944
01:09:24,253 --> 01:09:25,223
Well, you've had enough practice.

945
01:09:25,223 --> 01:09:28,797
It's the same role you always play --
cheap, dim-witted floozie.

946
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,166
He says I'm really incredibly good
in the picture.

947
01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:33,894
Then why is he sending us this crap?.

948
01:09:33,894 --> 01:09:36,163
Have you looked at these master-pieces?.

949
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:40,975
"The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing,"
you play a rich old man's mistress.

950
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:45,007
"The Revolt of Mamie Stovere,"
you play a hooker in Honolulu.

951
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:50,048
Oh, and here's an art movie,
"How To Be Very, Very Popular,

952
01:09:50,048 --> 01:09:53,178
Starring Marilyn Monroe
as Curly Flagg."

953
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:57,586
You should be working with Burton,
with Brando with Olivier!

954
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:01,828
But what if I'm, you know,
not that good of an actress?.

955
01:10:01,828 --> 01:10:04,432
I mean, what if I just don't have
that kind of talent?.

956
01:10:04,432 --> 01:10:07,195
Then you'll just have to develop
that kind of talent.

957
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,701
You'll just have to march
into Zanuck's office

958
01:10:09,701 --> 01:10:11,772
and remind him that he would lose

959
01:10:11,772 --> 01:10:13,704
about a million dollars a year
without you.

960
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:16,776
You'll just have to tell him
you want to do serious roles

961
01:10:16,776 --> 01:10:20,473
in serious films
with serious directors you select.

962
01:10:20,473 --> 01:10:21,742
And then what?.

963
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:23,246
Then will you be happy?.

964
01:10:23,246 --> 01:10:24,818
Will that be good enough for you?.

965
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,715
Will anything ever be good enough
for you?.

966
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:29,613
No, dear.

967
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:32,951
Movie stars don't choose
their own pictures.

968
01:10:32,951 --> 01:10:34,595
I choose their pictures.

969
01:10:34,595 --> 01:10:36,698
That's how they get to be movie stars.

970
01:10:36,698 --> 01:10:41,565
Understand me?. You are a movie star
because I made you a movie star.

971
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:42,759
You could send me your sister

972
01:10:42,759 --> 01:10:45,465
from Phily or your aunt Josephine
from Minneapolis...

973
01:10:45,465 --> 01:10:48,406
If I wanted to,
I could do the same thing for them.

974
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:56,578
No. If I am a star, it's the public
that has made me a star...

975
01:10:56,578 --> 01:11:00,712
No studio... No director... The public.

976
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:02,184
Is that so?.

977
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:05,250
Well, all the public
wants to see you do is sing

978
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:06,827
and dance and wiggle your ass!

979
01:11:06,827 --> 01:11:08,657
Who do you think you are --
Katherine Hepburn?.

980
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:11,364
You wanna play Shakespeare?.

981
01:11:11,364 --> 01:11:13,491
You wanna play
"The Brothers Karamazov?. "

982
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:16,694
Not the Brothers. Grushenka.

983
01:11:16,694 --> 01:11:18,033
Huh?.

984
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,175
She's a girl, Mr. Zanuck.

985
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:26,107
All right. Let's defer this discussion.

986
01:11:26,107 --> 01:11:29,274
We'll talk about it after
"The Seven Year Itch" is released.

987
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:33,418
Well, now I think
you need my help to promote that movie.

988
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:35,521
So that gives me more...

989
01:11:35,521 --> 01:11:38,388
What was that word
that Johnny used to use?.

990
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:43,254
I know...Leverage.

991
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:52,137
We're here today with Marilyn Monroe,

992
01:11:52,137 --> 01:11:54,265
the first woman in the history of show

993
01:11:54,265 --> 01:11:58,471
business who successfully negotiate her
own independent production deal.

994
01:11:58,471 --> 01:12:01,481
I'm Sidney Skolsky and I love Hollywood

995
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,685
Marilyn, I understand that under
the terms of your new deal

996
01:12:04,685 --> 01:12:08,415
you'll be developing screen properties
to produce yourself out of your office

997
01:12:08,415 --> 01:12:09,615
in New York. Now, uh...

998
01:12:09,615 --> 01:12:10,952
Why New York, Marilyn?.

999
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:12,924
Well, Sidney, I believe

1000
01:12:12,924 --> 01:12:15,223
it's a better atmosphere
for me to find good materia,

1001
01:12:15,223 --> 01:12:19,596
and for me to learn to use myself
more fully as an actress.

1002
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:24,831
You will never find
anyone who loves you like I do.

1003
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:27,867
You cannot even recognize sincere love
when it is offered to you --

1004
01:12:27,867 --> 01:12:29,773
you ungrateful brat!

1005
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:33,105
I took you in when you were nothing.

1006
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,474
I breathed live into you!

1007
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,677
I made you into a star!

1008
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:40,183
Yeah, you and apparently everybody else
in Hollywood.

1009
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:43,983
You would have thrown away your career
for a moron --

1010
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:45,624
for a cretin!

1011
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,689
I am the one who saved you!

1012
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:50,057
Yeah, well,
Joe isn't my husband anymore, Natash.

1013
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:51,822
And neither are you!

1014
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,530
Make it real. Make it honest.

1015
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:03,076
You are angry. Juliette is angry.

1016
01:13:03,076 --> 01:13:04,236
The nurse is dilatory.

1017
01:13:04,236 --> 01:13:06,280
You want to yell. You want to scream.

1018
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:12,411
So...do it. Go ahead. Come on, yell.

1019
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:15,215
I can't.

1020
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:19,887
You can't?. Then get out of the business

1021
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,395
What are you feeling now?.

1022
01:13:23,395 --> 01:13:25,693
You're frustrated now?. You're angry?.

1023
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:29,002
Then Yell, goddamn you!

1024
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:31,672
God, I'd die if he screamed at me
like like that.

1025
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:36,236
That's better. Now...

1026
01:13:36,236 --> 01:13:38,676
Listen if a doctor gives you good stuff
and it works,

1027
01:13:38,676 --> 01:13:40,213
you don't have to like him, do you?.

1028
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:43,747
This torture should be brought
in dismal hell.

1029
01:13:43,747 --> 01:13:45,376
Did Romeo slay himself?.

1030
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:52,092
Mr. Strasberg?.

1031
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:55,622
I really enjoyed your class today.

1032
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:58,193
You're so brilliant with actors.

1033
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:01,936
I have...

1034
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:05,138
Well, I've been wanting to extend
my range as an actress.

1035
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:09,372
And I've always dreamed of studying
at the Actor's Studio.

1036
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,049
It takes a lot of courage

1037
01:14:20,049 --> 01:14:24,091
for those who are already functioning
professionally to come to work here.

1038
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:25,957
Unfortunately,

1039
01:14:25,957 --> 01:14:30,690
you have already acquired
many odd habits and mannerisms

1040
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:33,199
which you now have to unlearn.

1041
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:40,131
I recommend private lessons
in my study perhaps three times a week.

1042
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:43,871
You might even like to stay
for dinner afterwards.

1043
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:48,274
Thank you.

1044
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:07,959
We've met before.

1045
01:15:07,959 --> 01:15:10,901
Elia Kazan introduced us years ago.

1046
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,640
I don't know if you remember.

1047
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,502
Why of course I remember, Art.

1048
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:17,736
I was just a very unimportant starlet
then and you just won

1049
01:15:17,736 --> 01:15:20,144
the Pulitzer Prize
for "Death of a Salesman."

1050
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:26,386
I'm prepping a new play, uh...
"A View From the Bridge."

1051
01:15:26,386 --> 01:15:28,717
We open next month at the Coronet.

1052
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:35,853
Uh...perhaps you'd like to stop by
and watch a rehearsal with me sometime

1053
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:38,628
maybe make a few suggestions.

1054
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:44,902
They'll say,
"If Arthur Miller's interested in her,

1055
01:15:44,902 --> 01:15:47,007
she must be more intelligent
than we thought.

1056
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,341
She must have hidden dimensions
we never even suspected."

1057
01:15:50,341 --> 01:15:51,503
They'll probably say,

1058
01:15:51,503 --> 01:15:55,515
"If Arthur Miller's interested in her,
he must be desperate to get laid."

1059
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:58,115
Didn't you figure it out last time?.

1060
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:00,014
So now, instead of
trying to cook spaghetti,

1061
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:02,020
you're gonna try to make matzo balls...

1062
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,852
They're harder, you idiot!

1063
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:06,994
You're not meant for love
and marriage -- you're not built for it.

1064
01:16:06,994 --> 01:16:08,460
Stick with what you're good at.

1065
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:10,131
Nothing if I listen to you!

1066
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,301
He's old enough to be your father!

1067
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:22,073
And then there's this voice in my head,
"Do this. Don't do that."

1068
01:16:23,145 --> 01:16:24,772
It never ever stops.

1069
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:26,445
You know, some days...

1070
01:16:26,445 --> 01:16:28,982
Well, a lot of days actually --
like even today...

1071
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:32,276
I uh, think I'm about one step away

1072
01:16:32,276 --> 01:16:35,390
from becoming a raving shit throwing
lunatic just like my mother

1073
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:37,685
and my grandmother... You know?.

1074
01:16:37,685 --> 01:16:38,656
'Cause it's in my blood.

1075
01:16:38,656 --> 01:16:40,091
It's in my brain.

1076
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:46,860
I...I don't...
I don't want to end up a zombie.

1077
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:54,205
I don't...I don't want to end up
lead around by some nurse

1078
01:16:54,205 --> 01:16:57,972
Iike some kind of
a wind-up doll on wheels.

1079
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,810
See, every morning I wake up
and I worry about whether

1080
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:05,078
I'm gonna end up in some hospital,

1081
01:17:05,754 --> 01:17:10,817
strapped to my bed and crapping
in my clothes -- screaming gibberish.

1082
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:16,697
Am I gonna end up like my mother,
Dr. Kris?.

1083
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,063
The science of the mind has progressed

1084
01:17:21,063 --> 01:17:23,501
a great deal in the last twenty years,
Marilyn.

1085
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:27,141
We are not as quick to hospitalize
as we once were.

1086
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:32,276
there are new therapies,
new medications.

1087
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:35,246
Tell me something, Dr. Kris.

1088
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:38,086
What would you think if I became a Jew?.

1089
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:14,912
But I think it should be a serious name
don't you?.

1090
01:18:14,912 --> 01:18:16,523
Like Isadora -- for your father.

1091
01:18:16,523 --> 01:18:20,128
Isadora?. The kid'll probably hate us
for the rest of his life.

1092
01:18:20,128 --> 01:18:21,923
Oh, no. I know!

1093
01:18:21,923 --> 01:18:23,964
What about Abe?. Abraham Miller.

1094
01:18:23,964 --> 01:18:26,897
Well, what about Sarah, or Hanna...
or Rachel?.

1095
01:18:26,897 --> 01:18:28,366
Oh, no, Papi.

1096
01:18:28,366 --> 01:18:29,868
I got a boy in here...

1097
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:33,230
And I'm gonna paint his room blue
and not a pastel blue, either,

1098
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:35,809
more like a robin's egg blue.

1099
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:46,245
Oh, Papi,

1100
01:18:46,245 --> 01:18:48,549
we're gonna be just like normal people,
aren't we?.

1101
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,560
Oh, do you think

1102
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:56,493
he'll be as happy to see me
as I'll be to see him?.

1103
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:03,728
Two guys dressed as women,
you think that's funny?.

1104
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:07,000
It's been the basis of
theatrical comedy

1105
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,076
from Shakespeare to Feydeau.

1106
01:19:09,076 --> 01:19:10,211
I think it's silly.

1107
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:12,209
Well, that's the point.

1108
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:15,242
Plus, he wants to shoot it
in black and white.

1109
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:19,614
My contract expressly guarantees that
I will always be shot in technicolor.

1110
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,548
Then turn it down.

1111
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:25,382
Well, somebody has to bring
in some money around here.

1112
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:28,421
So, I guess it might
as well be the pregnant wife.

1113
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:30,454
I can't count on you to do it.

1114
01:19:30,454 --> 01:19:32,226
I seem to remember that
you used to be a writer.

1115
01:19:32,226 --> 01:19:34,028
So what have you written lately, Arthur

1116
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:39,697
You turned out to be a full time job.

1117
01:19:39,697 --> 01:19:40,466
Well, that's right.

1118
01:19:40,466 --> 01:19:43,442
Just get up and walk away
like a fucking milquetoast!

1119
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:46,673
Why don't you write
about getting a stupid job!

1120
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:57,691
Oh, Arthur...Arthur...Arthur.

1121
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:03,122
How are you?.

1122
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:07,559
Alive. Lucky me.

1123
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:13,237
There's something wrong inside me,
Arthur...

1124
01:20:13,237 --> 01:20:16,105
Some defect...Some evil.

1125
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:19,442
God doesn't want me to have babies.

1126
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:25,248
We're gonna have lots of babies.

1127
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:31,751
We're gonna watch them grow big
and prosperous and dignified.

1128
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:34,488
They better take after you.

1129
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:53,948
Sorry.

1130
01:20:53,948 --> 01:20:55,071
I'll get the doctor.

1131
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:57,376
No. Pleaes don't go. Please.

1132
01:20:58,587 --> 01:20:59,986
I'll be right back.

1133
01:21:00,755 --> 01:21:01,380
Okay.

1134
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:14,299
Eh...Well, you must be very happy.

1135
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:16,092
No.

1136
01:21:16,092 --> 01:21:18,899
Liar. Come on...

1137
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,341
Tell me how babies
would just stretch my belly

1138
01:21:21,341 --> 01:21:23,171
and make my tits tag.

1139
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:27,611
Go ahead, this is your chance.

1140
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:29,644
This is your opportunity.

1141
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:34,716
Tell me
how I would have ended up fatter

1142
01:21:34,716 --> 01:21:36,847
and flabbier than I am already.

1143
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,389
God, you're awful quiet today.

1144
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,493
Never when I want you to.

1145
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:45,464
What's the matter?.

1146
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:47,831
This is one of your greatest days.

1147
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:10,520
Don't you know I love you, Marilyn?.

1148
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,007
Action!

1149
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:39,746
Where is that... bon-bon?.

1150
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:40,910
Cut!

1151
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:49,191
And...Action!

1152
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:18,857
Cut.

1153
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:31,160
I have an aunt in Vienna --
also an actress -- her name,

1154
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,467
I believe, is Mildered Lachenfarber.

1155
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:36,702
She always comes to the set on time,
she knows her lines perfectly,

1156
01:23:36,702 --> 01:23:39,279
she never gives anyone
the slightest trouble.

1157
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:42,176
And at the box office,
she's worth about fourteen cents.

1158
01:23:42,176 --> 01:23:43,511
You get my point.

1159
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:47,847
What good is being Marilyn Monroe if
I can't have a normal life and family?.

1160
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:49,387
A family...

1161
01:23:49,387 --> 01:23:51,754
I'd settle for just one baby.

1162
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:56,324
Why does everything have to turn out
to be so shitty?.

1163
01:23:56,324 --> 01:23:57,954
Maybe God
is trying to tell me something.

1164
01:23:58,233 --> 01:24:01,259
I'd probably be a kooky mother,
I'd probably love my child to death.

1165
01:24:01,259 --> 01:24:03,894
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!!!

1166
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:08,807
Did you hear her?. That voice.

1167
01:24:08,807 --> 01:24:10,205
That noise.

1168
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,109
It never goes away.

1169
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:15,781
Please make it stop, Dr. Kris.

1170
01:24:15,781 --> 01:24:17,316
Oh, plese, just turn it off.

1171
01:24:17,316 --> 01:24:19,181
I'm going to prescribe something
for your nerves.

1172
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:32,228
Oh, go ahead. Eat the whole bottle --
then they'll be reeeally sorry.

1173
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:34,564
Oh, go straight to hell.

1174
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:11,762
How can you have so little respect
for yourself when I love you so?.

1175
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:19,176
There. There we go.

1176
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:28,613
Papa?. How come you never talk to me

1177
01:25:28,613 --> 01:25:31,316
in those beautiful flowery sentences
like you write?.

1178
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:36,664
When the movie's over, I'll be better.

1179
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:40,058
I'll be a good wife to you, Papa.

1180
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:42,869
Acting tears me up inside.

1181
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:47,864
The first time I ever saw you,

1182
01:25:48,243 --> 01:25:54,204
you were so beautiful
and so angelic that you almost made me

1183
01:25:54,204 --> 01:25:55,782
believe in God again.

1184
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:57,975
And now?.

1185
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:09,487
We're losin' the light Mr. Clift.

1186
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:14,260
I'm on my way.

1187
01:26:20,942 --> 01:26:22,000
I hate you, Arthur.

1188
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,668
Really?. Why is that, Marilyn?.

1189
01:26:24,668 --> 01:26:27,007
Well, you're so smart,
why don't you figure it out?.

1190
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:33,184
You told me you were going to write me
the best role of my career.

1191
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:35,981
This is the best you could do?.

1192
01:26:37,058 --> 01:26:39,253
The character is passive and stupid --

1193
01:26:39,253 --> 01:26:42,557
she just wonders around all day long
feeling sorry for herself.

1194
01:26:42,557 --> 01:26:44,221
Is this the way you see me?.

1195
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,894
Is this the way I inspire you?.

1196
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:52,564
"The Misfits!?. "

1197
01:26:52,564 --> 01:26:54,537
You're the misfit, Arthur.

1198
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:57,705
You don't know
the first goddamn thing about darma!

1199
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:01,875
And after all you've taught me.

1200
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,143
You're a lousy writer, Arthur!

1201
01:27:05,143 --> 01:27:06,617
And you're a lousy husband!

1202
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:18,798
They need you in the bleachers now,
Miss Monroe.

1203
01:27:18,798 --> 01:27:21,401
And hey, kill that motor, will you?.
We're ready for a take.

1204
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:25,465
No. Go on. Just drive. Go. Go! Just go!

1205
01:27:25,465 --> 01:27:26,699
Just get outta here, goddamn it!!!

1206
01:27:26,699 --> 01:27:27,808
Get out of here!

1207
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:40,319
Which is it, communism or freedom?.

1208
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:42,679
We'll triumph
in the next five or ten years.

1209
01:27:42,679 --> 01:27:43,916
That's what should concern us.

1210
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,592
God, he's brilliant...

1211
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:48,589
Absolutely magnificent.

1212
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:51,622
I think he's gonna be another Lincoln.

1213
01:27:53,735 --> 01:27:55,726
No, no, no. Don't do it that way.

1214
01:27:56,037 --> 01:27:57,766
Wait. I'll show you.

1215
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:00,430
This works much faster, believe me.

1216
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:08,613
Weeeee!

1217
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:13,150
Sometimes, I open them up

1218
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:17,122
and I let the granules dissolve
on my tongue, like communion.

1219
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:19,656
But mostly, I mix it with stuff.

1220
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,354
I like Nembutal with gin.

1221
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:26,425
But Dexamyl's good with champagne
'cause it bubbles see...

1222
01:28:26,425 --> 01:28:28,000
It's really the best combination.

1223
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:30,670
Unless you can get your hands
on some Mandrax.

1224
01:28:32,373 --> 01:28:36,867
I once almost lost a whole bottle of
Mandrax on an airplane.

1225
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:39,204
It happened a couple of years ago.

1226
01:28:39,204 --> 01:28:42,372
I was flying to Louisville to shoot
"Raintree County"

1227
01:28:42,372 --> 01:28:45,975
and I went to the john
and I managed to drop a hundred

1228
01:28:45,975 --> 01:28:50,557
and fifty randy Mandies down
into the TWA crapper.

1229
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:52,089
What did you do?.

1230
01:28:52,089 --> 01:28:55,491
Well, I had to go in and fish 'em out.

1231
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:05,138
My right arm turned...turned...
turned blue all the way up to my elbow!

1232
01:29:05,138 --> 01:29:09,505
It itched like a sonuva -
bitch for like three weeks.

1233
01:29:11,546 --> 01:29:14,344
Ohhh...
That's what I love about you, Monty.

1234
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:18,208
You're the only one
I know who's more fucked up than me.

1235
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:35,825
What?.

1236
01:29:37,605 --> 01:29:40,130
Arthur's never coming back, is he?.

1237
01:29:47,615 --> 01:29:51,449
Well then
he's the biggest fool God ever made.

1238
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:57,555
I haven't washed my hair in days.

1239
01:29:57,959 --> 01:29:59,256
I haven't slept in a week.

1240
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:01,924
"Something's Got To Give"
starts shooting in nine days.

1241
01:30:01,924 --> 01:30:03,928
I have a wardrobe test on Monday,

1242
01:30:03,928 --> 01:30:07,626
and I look like somebody
who's been buried and dug up again.

1243
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:12,371
So, what can you give me to bring me
back to human?.

1244
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:15,503
What do you usually take?.

1245
01:30:15,503 --> 01:30:22,173
Nembutal, Seconal...Chloral Hydrate...
Phenobarbital...

1246
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:27,011
Amytal, Dexamyl...Demerol sometimes.

1247
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:32,886
You take the Amytal
and the Demerol intravenously?.

1248
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:34,922
Mmmmmm, usually.

1249
01:30:35,563 --> 01:30:37,428
Self-administered?.

1250
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:41,928
I know some doctors...
I like the "professional touch."

1251
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:47,003
From now on, I'd like you
to restrict yourself to one doctor.

1252
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:50,775
For the time being,

1253
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:53,336
I'm going to allow
the Chloral Hydrate --

1254
01:30:54,415 --> 01:30:56,849
it's fast acting and I think

1255
01:30:56,849 --> 01:30:59,316
it's going to help to wean you off of
the other barbiturates.

1256
01:30:59,316 --> 01:31:00,749
But...

1257
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:03,621
...No more IV drugs.

1258
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:06,151
Now do you understand?.

1259
01:31:07,195 --> 01:31:09,129
Party pooper.

1260
01:31:14,168 --> 01:31:14,759
Thank you.

1261
01:31:17,705 --> 01:31:19,195
Mmmmhmmm. Oh...Marilyn?.

1262
01:31:19,195 --> 01:31:21,240
This is my son, Danny.

1263
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,342
Hi.
Hi.

1264
01:31:24,212 --> 01:31:26,772
Oh, go ahead. I'll see you tomorrow.

1265
01:31:27,081 --> 01:31:28,412
Walk her out, Dan?.

1266
01:31:29,217 --> 01:31:30,514
Oh, sure.
He doesn't have to.

1267
01:31:35,857 --> 01:31:40,317
Hey, Danny...What are you studying?.

1268
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:42,687
contemporary American Government.

1269
01:31:42,897 --> 01:31:47,231
Really?. Can I ask you something?.

1270
01:31:48,603 --> 01:31:50,127
Uh, I hope I can answer.

1271
01:31:50,905 --> 01:31:53,772
If you were going to meet
the President of the United States,

1272
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:55,699
what would you talk about?.

1273
01:31:57,011 --> 01:32:00,139
Of course, if you like sports, uh,
we usually have a pick-up game of uh,

1274
01:32:00,139 --> 01:32:02,111
touch football on Saturdays --
usually quite fun.

1275
01:32:02,111 --> 01:32:03,239
It is fun.

1276
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:04,509
Excellent Brandy.

1277
01:32:07,822 --> 01:32:08,948
Mr. President?.

1278
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:10,779
Yes?.

1279
01:32:11,325 --> 01:32:13,259
Isn't the massive build up of U.S. Aid

1280
01:32:13,259 --> 01:32:15,726
and the dispatch of thousands of
"advisors" into South Vietnam

1281
01:32:15,726 --> 01:32:18,457
a direct violation
of the Geneva accords?.

1282
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:25,595
Well, the uh trouble is we...
we are violating the Geneva agreement.

1283
01:32:25,595 --> 01:32:31,440
Uh, not as much as North Vietnamese are
but violating them never-theless.

1284
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:36,982
So, whatever we do has to be done
with a certain amount of uh... secrecy.

1285
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:40,077
And of course
there's always an element of uh...

1286
01:32:40,077 --> 01:32:41,813
danger in that, isn't there?.

1287
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:07,905
Thanks, Mr. President,
for the things you've done...

1288
01:33:08,449 --> 01:33:10,781
Battles that you've won.

1289
01:33:11,152 --> 01:33:12,813
The way you deal with...

1290
01:33:14,822 --> 01:33:16,050
What's the matter, honey?.

1291
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:17,723
You're wearing my dress.

1292
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:21,352
That dress costs
twelve thousand dollars, you bitch!

1293
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:24,022
Is that the sort of language
a First Lady uses?.

1294
01:33:24,022 --> 01:33:25,257
I don't think so.

1295
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:27,593
But first Ladies don't look like whores

1296
01:33:27,593 --> 01:33:30,795
they don't act like whores
and they don't stink like whores.

1297
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:33,205
Stop it! Stop it!

1298
01:33:34,942 --> 01:33:36,739
Can't you see that
you're just going to ruin everything

1299
01:33:36,739 --> 01:33:39,607
if you go out there looking
like a high priced slut!

1300
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:42,207
You have to wear something simple.

1301
01:33:42,883 --> 01:33:43,872
Something elegant.

1302
01:33:43,872 --> 01:33:46,282
Something befitting the wife
of a President.

1303
01:33:46,654 --> 01:33:48,645
Jack likes me to look sexy.

1304
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:51,058
He says it gets rid
of the pain in his back.

1305
01:33:51,325 --> 01:33:52,314
Yeah, right.

1306
01:33:53,961 --> 01:33:55,155
This is better on me, anyway.

1307
01:33:55,155 --> 01:33:56,729
You're too fat to wear it.

1308
01:33:57,064 --> 01:33:59,396
Haven't you read,
Jackie only weighs twelve pounds...

1309
01:33:59,396 --> 01:34:01,592
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.

1310
01:34:01,902 --> 01:34:04,666
You only read Dostoyevski
or is it tolstoy?.

1311
01:34:04,666 --> 01:34:06,432
Can't you forget about Jackie?.!

1312
01:34:06,707 --> 01:34:07,867
It's just a political marriage.

1313
01:34:07,867 --> 01:34:08,634
He doesn't love her.

1314
01:34:08,634 --> 01:34:10,710
He never sticks his band up her dress
like he does to me!

1315
01:34:11,512 --> 01:34:14,345
You think you are so grand.

1316
01:34:14,582 --> 01:34:15,776
The President's whore!

1317
01:34:15,776 --> 01:34:17,941
How many women do you think he has?.

1318
01:34:18,252 --> 01:34:19,583
Isn't this what you wanted?.

1319
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:22,146
You're the one who wanted
the nice clothes

1320
01:34:22,146 --> 01:34:23,688
and the money and the power.

1321
01:34:23,688 --> 01:34:24,756
I did this for you.

1322
01:34:24,756 --> 01:34:25,824
Bullshit!

1323
01:34:26,193 --> 01:34:28,184
You've never done anything for me.

1324
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:31,856
But I'm gonna do something for you...
ohhhh...

1325
01:34:45,379 --> 01:34:46,641
What the hell is going on here?.

1326
01:34:47,148 --> 01:34:49,582
Marilyn, you were supposed
to be on stage an hour ago.

1327
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:53,714
What did you take?.

1328
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:57,648
What did you take!?.

1329
01:34:58,159 --> 01:34:59,683
I didn't take anything, Peter.

1330
01:34:59,683 --> 01:35:01,886
Nothing, I swear, that's the problem.

1331
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:06,855
Okay.

1332
01:35:08,869 --> 01:35:10,063
I'll take care of it.

1333
01:35:12,773 --> 01:35:16,368
Thank you! Oh, Happy Birthday,
Mr. President!

1334
01:35:16,368 --> 01:35:17,534
Happy Birhtday to you!

1335
01:35:29,457 --> 01:35:32,517
Say, how'd you all like
to hear another one, huh?.

1336
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:42,400
Honey, what on earth
did you do to this dress?.

1337
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,902
I've had to sew
a whole new seam way up the fornt!

1338
01:35:44,902 --> 01:35:46,506
And it was plenty tight to begin with.

1339
01:35:46,506 --> 01:35:50,736
You know, I may have to open up a slit
in the back, just so you can walk.

1340
01:35:51,378 --> 01:35:52,811
I'm sorry, Hazel.

1341
01:35:53,681 --> 01:35:55,114
I can't find Sidney Guilaroff anywhere.

1342
01:35:55,114 --> 01:35:57,274
Somebody said he left
about a half an hour ago.

1343
01:35:57,274 --> 01:35:59,716
He's probably half way
to Idlewild by now.

1344
01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:00,817
The only hairstylist

1345
01:36:00,817 --> 01:36:03,389
still hanging around back stage
is Mickey Song.

1346
01:36:03,389 --> 01:36:05,184
He's the guy who does the Kennedy's.

1347
01:36:06,127 --> 01:36:09,426
Oooh, well, I sure
as hell don't want to look like Jackie.

1348
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:11,229
You ask him to come in.

1349
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:18,929
Hey, you tell him
I wanna look just like Jackie.

1350
01:36:21,275 --> 01:36:23,937
In the history of show business,
in fact,

1351
01:36:23,937 --> 01:36:28,811
there has been no one female who
has meant so much,

1352
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:32,411
who's done more...What?.

1353
01:36:44,431 --> 01:36:45,659
Mr. President...

1354
01:36:48,335 --> 01:36:50,929
The late Marilyn Monroe.

1355
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:39,218
Happy Birthday to you...

1356
01:37:45,793 --> 01:37:46,993
Happy Birthday to you...

1357
01:37:55,202 --> 01:38:02,506
Happy Birthday, Mr. President...

1358
01:38:04,245 --> 01:38:05,445
Happy Birthday to you...

1359
01:38:18,092 --> 01:38:19,389
The President's concerned.

1360
01:38:20,427 --> 01:38:24,227
We're all concerned,
in fact, that uh...

1361
01:38:25,132 --> 01:38:26,997
your involvement with him

1362
01:38:26,997 --> 01:38:29,226
has become a little too public
for comfort.

1363
01:38:30,371 --> 01:38:33,363
Especially since your performance
at the Birthday Gala.

1364
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:37,169
But you were the one who asked me
to sing Happy Birthday to him.

1365
01:38:37,169 --> 01:38:39,836
And you...you telephone the President
from your dressing room

1366
01:38:39,836 --> 01:38:41,743
when other people are present.

1367
01:38:41,743 --> 01:38:44,817
And you put these phone calls through
the FOX switch-board.

1368
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:47,348
Now, the family cannot,

1369
01:38:47,348 --> 01:38:50,718
and will not tolerate this level
of indiscretion.

1370
01:38:53,027 --> 01:38:54,790
He's going to marry me, Bobby.

1371
01:38:56,330 --> 01:38:57,592
No.

1372
01:38:58,299 --> 01:38:59,163
I don't believe

1373
01:38:59,163 --> 01:39:01,427
the President ever gave you
any reason to think that.

1374
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:04,228
So now I have to ask you

1375
01:39:04,228 --> 01:39:07,033
not to attempt to contact him
in any way.

1376
01:39:09,743 --> 01:39:11,973
Now, he believes
it's the best thing for him,

1377
01:39:12,746 --> 01:39:14,805
and it's the best thing for America.

1378
01:39:26,493 --> 01:39:30,725
And personally, I...
I think he's crazy.

1379
01:39:37,104 --> 01:39:41,165
Listen, I'd uh...I'd like to give you
my private phone number.

1380
01:39:43,911 --> 01:39:47,005
This'll put you right through
to my desk at the Justice Department.

1381
01:39:51,685 --> 01:39:53,277
But they can't fire me.

1382
01:39:53,277 --> 01:39:55,479
I've never been fired before in my life

1383
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:57,120
I had to promise them

1384
01:39:57,391 --> 01:40:00,827
that you'd be on the set on time
every morning.

1385
01:40:01,762 --> 01:40:06,324
Well, you've worked exactly four
of the last twenty-one days.

1386
01:40:06,967 --> 01:40:09,026
Every man woman and child in America

1387
01:40:09,026 --> 01:40:11,660
saw you singing Happy Birthday
to the President

1388
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:15,400
when you to me you were home sick
with a virus!

1389
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:18,306
Ah, honey, you're all out of chances.

1390
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:21,671
But I was ill. You know know that I was

1391
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:25,179
So Liz Taylor can get sick and I can't,
is that it?.

1392
01:40:25,179 --> 01:40:28,014
Every time she sneezes
they spend four million dollars

1393
01:40:28,014 --> 01:40:31,056
to break down the set
and move 'em to a warmer climate.

1394
01:40:31,558 --> 01:40:33,389
And her arms are fat.

1395
01:40:34,361 --> 01:40:37,228
Oh, Henry, her arms are so fat.

1396
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:44,136
I make millions for them
and this is how they treat me!?.

1397
01:40:44,571 --> 01:40:47,768
Fucking Weinstein --
fucking bastard -- Judas!

1398
01:40:48,642 --> 01:40:50,109
No, he's out to get me.

1399
01:40:50,109 --> 01:40:51,006
They're all out to get me!

1400
01:40:51,006 --> 01:40:54,478
Especially that stupid, no talent,
over-the-hill washed up Cukor.

1401
01:40:55,849 --> 01:40:57,680
What do you mean?. Of course you can!

1402
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:59,479
You're the Attorney General
of the United Staes,

1403
01:40:59,479 --> 01:41:01,247
for chrissakes,
you could do whatever you want!

1404
01:41:02,623 --> 01:41:04,022
No! You can! You can!

1405
01:41:04,022 --> 01:41:04,954
No, you could!

1406
01:41:04,954 --> 01:41:06,855
If you wanted to you could put them
in jail.

1407
01:41:06,855 --> 01:41:09,292
You...you could,
you could audit their taxes,

1408
01:41:09,292 --> 01:41:10,522
you could deport them.

1409
01:41:10,522 --> 01:41:12,188
You can have them assassinated!

1410
01:41:14,101 --> 01:41:20,199
Oh, no. Oh...Bobby. Bobby...Oh...

1411
01:41:23,877 --> 01:41:26,971
God, Eddie, wouldn't you know it,
I'd get a dog with depression.

1412
01:41:28,816 --> 01:41:30,613
Uh...it's a beautiful house, Marilyn.

1413
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:32,983
I'm impressed. I am.

1414
01:41:32,983 --> 01:41:34,246
Thanks.

1415
01:41:35,589 --> 01:41:38,353
You know, I've been planning
a trip to Mexico to pick some tiles

1416
01:41:38,353 --> 01:41:42,155
and furniture and stuff,
I'm actually gonna leave on Thursday.

1417
01:41:42,155 --> 01:41:43,353
It sounds great.

1418
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:45,190
Did I tell you?.

1419
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:47,900
I've been renegotiating my deal at FOX?.

1420
01:41:48,569 --> 01:41:51,800
They're gonna hire me
back at twice my old salary.

1421
01:41:52,606 --> 01:41:53,732
I don't even wanna ask.

1422
01:41:54,908 --> 01:41:58,605
You know, Eddie...
Being with you, is like old times.

1423
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:01,438
Rmember the Ambassador?.

1424
01:42:03,984 --> 01:42:06,214
Yeah, I do.

1425
01:42:08,188 --> 01:42:09,849
You used to love me then.

1426
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:20,191
You know, Eddie.

1427
01:42:21,034 --> 01:42:25,164
When I was little, nobody loved me.

1428
01:42:29,009 --> 01:42:30,499
Nobody at all.

1429
01:42:31,545 --> 01:42:33,410
But then when I grew up,

1430
01:42:33,881 --> 01:42:37,044
I learned that I could make anyone fall
in love with me...

1431
01:42:38,519 --> 01:42:41,044
Just by taking off my dress.

1432
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:55,131
Well, I guess
I've gotten smarter since then,

1433
01:42:55,131 --> 01:42:58,204
so...I'm gonna say goodnight.

1434
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:03,009
You're leaving Eddie?.

1435
01:43:06,046 --> 01:43:07,240
Yeah, I have to get back.

1436
01:43:07,447 --> 01:43:08,641
Hey, did I tell you?.

1437
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:11,014
I made a settlement with FOX.

1438
01:43:12,252 --> 01:43:15,278
They're gonna pay me five times
my old salary.

1439
01:43:16,957 --> 01:43:18,891
I'm gonna start to work next Thursday.

1440
01:43:19,259 --> 01:43:20,783
What happened to Mexico?.

1441
01:43:22,095 --> 01:43:24,893
After I get back from Mexico.

1442
01:43:28,535 --> 01:43:29,763
Have a safe trip.

1443
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:34,732
There are eighty-eight tiles around
the rim of the swimming pool.

1444
01:43:34,732 --> 01:43:37,571
There are three-hundred-sixty-seven
flagstones in the walkway.

1445
01:43:37,844 --> 01:43:38,538
There are one thousand,

1446
01:43:38,538 --> 01:43:39,873
eight hundred seventy-four tiles...
on the roof...

1447
01:43:39,873 --> 01:43:44,040
No! I told you, you have to walk
at least three steps behind me!

1448
01:43:45,752 --> 01:43:47,845
There are eighty-eight tiles around
the rim of the swimming pool.

1449
01:43:47,845 --> 01:43:49,853
There are three hundred sixty seven
flagstones on the walkway.

1450
01:43:49,853 --> 01:43:51,116
There are one thousand...
Hello, sweetheart.

1451
01:43:51,116 --> 01:43:55,854
Oh, yes! Yes!
You are happy, aren't you?.

1452
01:43:55,854 --> 01:43:57,156
Aren't you happy?.

1453
01:43:57,731 --> 01:43:59,323
Oh, yes, you are!

1454
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,058
You are.

1455
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:08,306
Robert Kennedy residence.

1456
01:44:09,743 --> 01:44:11,973
Hi. It's Marilyn.

1457
01:44:12,879 --> 01:44:14,642
Could I talk to Bobby, please?.

1458
01:44:15,215 --> 01:44:16,944
Just a moment, Miss Monroe.

1459
01:44:23,824 --> 01:44:24,347
Angel?.

1460
01:44:24,347 --> 01:44:26,152
Mr. Kennedy's unavailable
to speak to you.

1461
01:44:26,152 --> 01:44:28,818
He is accepting no more calls
until further notice.

1462
01:44:28,818 --> 01:44:31,055
Please, don't attempt to make contact.
Thank you.

1463
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:48,346
What are you doing?.

1464
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:54,778
Sometimes I have to hurt myself,
just to see if I can still feel.

1465
01:44:57,357 --> 01:45:00,087
Get out of my house! I hate you!

1466
01:45:01,061 --> 01:45:02,528
It's all your fault.

1467
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:08,059
He dumped you as fast as he could
because you're a cheap piece of trash.

1468
01:45:08,869 --> 01:45:10,700
You're ignorant and you have no class.

1469
01:45:10,937 --> 01:45:13,804
No. That's you. I'm Marilyn.

1470
01:45:17,077 --> 01:45:19,045
You're only good for one thing.

1471
01:45:19,513 --> 01:45:22,243
That's why every man you've ever known
has walked out on you.

1472
01:45:22,582 --> 01:45:23,981
They've all walked out on you.

1473
01:45:24,284 --> 01:45:25,444
Even your daddy.

1474
01:45:25,786 --> 01:45:30,689
Freddy, Johnny, Joe.
I won't listen. I won't.

1475
01:45:30,689 --> 01:45:39,630
Arthur, Bobby. Even your fans.
They all left you.

1476
01:45:40,734 --> 01:45:42,258
We could have had it all!

1477
01:45:42,803 --> 01:45:46,671
But you had to go and wreck it,
like everything else in your life.

1478
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:51,343
I'll make you go away.

1479
01:45:57,117 --> 01:45:57,981
Thirty-six years old

1480
01:45:57,981 --> 01:46:00,279
and your tits are sagging faster
than your ass.

1481
01:46:02,389 --> 01:46:08,089
No. I'll make you go...
I'll make you go away.

1482
01:46:46,133 --> 01:46:47,566
Your mind is gone.

1483
01:46:49,403 --> 01:46:51,598
You're just a drunk and a pill head.

1484
01:46:56,676 --> 01:46:58,667
No wonder everybody left you.

1485
01:47:04,151 --> 01:47:11,284
It's too late. Everybody hates you.

1486
01:47:12,793 --> 01:47:14,761
Never work again.

1487
01:47:16,797 --> 01:47:19,766
The world will be better off
without you.

1488
01:47:45,058 --> 01:47:49,825
Jesus loves me, this I know.

1489
01:47:51,097 --> 01:47:57,627
For the Bible tells me so...
