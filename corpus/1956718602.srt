Ike?

4
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Come on now,
get up.

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Get up. You, too, Bobby.

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No one's looking to read
yesterday's news, guys.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Aren't you eating with US?

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Can't. I have to
get to school early.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why?

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well, I have to talk
to the principal

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
about a student.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What'd he do?
You catch him cheating?

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Cheating is the least
of his problems.

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Drink your juice.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Isn't mom coming down today?

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I can't say
what she'll do.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Can I get you something?

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Ella?

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You want coffee?

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Will you help me later?

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'd like to do
it this evening.

22
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What is the matter with you?

23
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Did you go out drinking
last night? Huh?

24
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, mama,
just go back to bed.

25
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Well, what is it, then?

26
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Victoria?

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Nothing. Nothing!

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I am on to you,
little miss.

29
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
On to what?

30
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You've got a baby in you,

31
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and that's what's
making you puke.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Isn't that what's going on here?
Isn't it? Hmm?

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How many times
did I warn you?

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Now look at you.

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Look it here
at what's happened.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I told you, didn't I?!

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, mama, you told
me a lot of things.

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't you get smart with me.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Then help me,

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
mama, 'cause I need you
to help me.

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It is too late for that.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You got yourself into this,
you can get yourself out.

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You don't want to listen to what
I have to say?

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can follow your father
right out that door,

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
'cause I will not have you
living in this house.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Not like this.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You don't mean that.

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Just see if I don't.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You just try me, miss.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Mother?

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Did you already deliver
your papers?

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Mm-hmm.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What time is it?

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Quarter to 8:00.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well, you better go.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You don't want
to be late.

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Wait.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Can I have a kiss first?

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I hope you feel better, mom.

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why'd you have
to say that?

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Woman:
All right, Mrs. Leslie,

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I get it.

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let me see if I
can have him get
right back to you.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
She sure will.

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You betcha.

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Bye now.

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Save me.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What?

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What was that about?

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Angry mother.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
She saw the school
play last night,

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and she's all
bent out of shape

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
over Lindy rayburn

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
singing in public,

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
wearing what looks
like a black slip.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh! Maybe I should go see
this play.

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Is he free?
I have an appointment.

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Judy, can I borrow
your copy machine?

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh, it's all yours.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Mm...

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What's wrong?

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You look kind of stuck
in the spin cycle.

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Your boys okay?

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
They're fine.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Ella?

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
She's fine.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He's wrapping it up.

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Look, if-if he wants
to reschedule...

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Thank you.

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I see here that you're failing
Russell Beckman first semester.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Tom, everybody knows

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Mr. Beckman
isn't any kind

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
of student.

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Well, unless he gets struck
by lightning, he never will be,

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
but he's got to have history
to graduate.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, maybe he won't.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Now, Tom,
right there we got a problem.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Go a little easy on this kid,
would you?

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What? You want him back here
next year?

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I-I don't want him here
this year,

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
but somebody better tell him
that he better do the work.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You do me a favor, Tom.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You scare the boy,
but don't fail him.

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Vicky.

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're here early.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Everything okay?

108
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Hi.

109
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Hey, there, miss Vicky.

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They're wanting
some of them pots pretty quick.

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So, uh, you need some help
tying that apron?

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Not from you.

113
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What would you like me
to tell the boys?

114
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Well... well, tell them

115
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
they can come and visit
whenever they want.

116
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You're not going to make that
a problem, will you?

117
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Thank you.

118
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Mama!

119
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Open up!

120
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Mama?

121
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Would you please open up?

122
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Mama!

123
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't do this!

124
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't do this, ma...

125
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're not going anywhere,
pops.

126
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Just someone at the door.

127
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll answer it.

128
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Put your cap away
and get back into bed. Go on.

129
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Hi.

130
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Thanks.

131
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Can you tell me who it is?

132
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
A boy.

133
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Ah, I kind of figured that.

134
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Does he have a name?

135
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't really
want to say.

136
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I mean, he
doesn't want it.

137
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Well, he at least ought
to take some responsibility.

138
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Does this boy
live here in town?

139
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Is he in your class?

140
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You don't know him,

141
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
miss Jonas.

142
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We met last summer,
and we went out for a while.

143
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And at first, I thought that...

144
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I don't know what I thought,
but he seemed nice.

145
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Why don't we finish talking
tomorrow?

146
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Are you sure it's
okay for me to stay?

147
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah, it's fine.

148
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, for now.

149
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
My father lives here, too,

150
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and-and I'm not sure
he'll understand this.

151
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It'll work out.

152
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So, what do you
two boys want?

153
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Collecting for the paper.

154
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's $2.50.

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Is that so?

156
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Well, I don't think
I'm going to pay you,

157
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
so what do you
think of that?

158
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Who cuts your hair these days?

159
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Our mother.

160
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I thought your mother
moved out.

161
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I heard

162
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
she moved into
that rental house

163
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
over on 3rd street
last week.

164
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Just give them the money,
Harvey.

165
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm making a point.

166
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
See, I get my
papers from you,

167
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
you get your hair cut by me.

168
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's called commerce.

169
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Well? What do you say

170
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
when a man pays his bill?

171
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Thank you.

172
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Maybe you need

173
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
to remind your mom that
I went to school for this.

174
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's not a hobby.

175
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Why does he always...

176
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He's a silly old dog bone

177
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
who probably
flunked barber school.

178
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
That's why.

179
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Listen, you're going
to let me

180
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
do all the talking
on this one, you hear?

181
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Who is it?

182
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We're collecting
for the paper, ma'am.

183
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You might as well come in.

184
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't touch anything.

185
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And sit, sit over there.

186
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We can't stay, ma'am.

187
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, hush.

188
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You got a whole
lifetime ahead of you.

189
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Sit.

190
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
All right.

191
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Start talking.

192
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's $2.50.

193
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That is not talk,
that is business.

194
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What are you learning in school?

195
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You both go to school don't you?

196
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Why don't you
speak, hmm?

197
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What's
your name?

198
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Bobby.

199
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Bobby.

200
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Who's your teacher?

201
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Mrs. Kean.

202
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Kean.

203
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah, kean, big, tall woman
with a long jaw?

204
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Is she a good
teacher?

205
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah, but one time
she told a girl to shut up.

206
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Did she?

207
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What for?

208
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
She didn't want to sit
next to Ricky Peterson.

209
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
She said he smelled
like a cow pie.

210
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
He probably does.

211
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
His folks own a dairy,
don't they?

212
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What about you?

213
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Who's your
teacher?

214
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Miss carpenter.

215
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't know her.

216
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
She's got long blonde hair
and she always wears sweaters.

217
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What do you know about sweaters?

218
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You're too young to be thinking
about women and sweaters.

219
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Don't you two boys ever smoke.
You hear me?

220
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But you do.

221
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That's why i'm
telling you.

222
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You don't want
to end up like me, do you?

223
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
An old woman, living by herself

224
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
above
a barber shop.

225
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'll never be an old woman.

226
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Lucky you.

227
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Hand me my handbag, will you?

228
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Thank you.

229
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What happened
to your family?

230
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm all that's left of it.

231
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Our mother doesn't
live with US anymore.

232
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Shut up, Bobby.

233
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
That's nobody's
business.

234
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's all right.

235
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm not going to tell nobody.

236
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Who could I tell anyway?

237
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Hmm?

238
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Ms. Jonas, isn't there
a woman doctor I could go to?

239
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Not here, honey.

240
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Not in this town.

241
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Well, maybe
we can go to another town.

242
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Victoria, sweetie, listen to me.

243
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You're here now.

244
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
This is where you are.

245
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Come here.

246
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You don't
to be
careless.Wan
t

247
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
this is too important.

248
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Ho!

249
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Well?

250
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, she got one.

251
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's about time.

252
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Bobby:
Is that them?

253
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Tom:
Yep.

254
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What was he doing
to that cow?

255
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
They're just checking

256
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
to see if she's
got a calf.

257
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Are we going to have to do that?

258
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yep.

259
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Come on.

260
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I promised to help
these guys, let's go.

261
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I see you brought a whole team.

262
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yeah, well,
they wanted to come.

263
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Ike, Bobby, come over here.

264
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This is Harold mcpheron.

265
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That there is his
brother

266
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Raymond.

267
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Raymond:
How much these
workers going

268
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
to set US back?

269
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Well, I don't know
what they'll charge.

270
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You'll just have to ask them.

271
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Come on, boys.

272
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You boys go in there.

273
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You want to keep
an eye out

274
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
on that big red one.

275
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why?
What's wrong with her?

276
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Nothing.

277
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But it looks like she already

278
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
chewed off her own tail,
and she'd be happy

279
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
to start on yours.

280
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yah. Yah.

281
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yah!
Go on.

282
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Go on, move it.

283
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yah! Yah!

284
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yah!

285
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yah!

286
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Okay, boys.

287
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That's enough.

288
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Well, it looks to me

289
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
like this baby wants
to arrive in may.

290
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I expect you'll have
various kinds of trouble.

291
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
In some ways, your
body's not ready.

292
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
On the other hand,
you do seem strong.

293
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Do you want to keep
this baby, Victoria?

294
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Have you thought
about what it'll mean,

295
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
having this kind of
responsibility at your age?

296
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I do.

297
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I... want it.

298
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I want it.

299
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Harold,

300
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
that
isn't necessary.

301
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Stay out of this.

302
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You boys did
a fine job.

303
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You come back
again anytime.

304
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You hear?

305
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Dad.

306
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah?

307
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
He gave US $10 each.

308
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You think we should
give it back?

309
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
No.

310
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I think that'd be
an insult.

311
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm guessing they
enjoyed having you here.

312
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Do they live out
here all alone?

313
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
They do.

314
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
How come?

315
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
They always have.

316
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
They lost their folks when
they were pretty young.

317
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Why didn't they ever get married

318
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
and have a family
like everyone else?

319
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't know.

320
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
People don't
sometimes.

321
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Maybe they didn't want
to leave each other.

322
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Maybe so.

323
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Girl:
During the Indian removal,

324
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
over 90 tribes

325
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
were taken from their
lands in the east.

326
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
When the cherokees
were asked to move,

327
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
they went to the supreme court
and asked for help.

328
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But president Andrews didn't
care what the court said...

329
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Tom:
President Andrew

330
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Jackson.

331
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Go on.

332
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Um... president Andrew Jackson

333
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
didn't care what the court said,

334
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
so the cherokees
had to move to Tennessee.

335
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm done.

336
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Do you have anything

337
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
about the black hawk war,
the seminole's reaction?

338
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I wrote two pages.

339
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Congratulations.

340
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Sit down.

341
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Can somebody tell me why
president Andrew Jackson

342
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
felt that the bank of u.S. Only
benefited the rich and powerful?

343
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Who did I ask to research
that question?

344
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Victoria?

345
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Victoria?

346
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Wasn't it you?

347
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yeah.

348
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
All right,
enough of that.

349
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The bank crisis of 1819.

350
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
All right, Victoria,
can you start again

351
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and speak in
a loud and clear voice?

352
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Shh.

353
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
What just happened?

354
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What did you say Russell?

355
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I, uh...

356
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I didn't say nothing.

357
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Charlene,
go see what's wrong.

358
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Mr. Beckman.

359
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
In the hall, now.

360
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Look, I didn't
say nothing, okay?

361
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You said something.

362
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
In the hall.

363
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You're already
in serious trouble,

364
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
and if you think i'm
going to pass you...

365
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Ask me if I care.

366
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Oh, you will buster, you will.

367
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
No, I won't.

368
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You don't know
a thing about me,

369
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
so why don't you
get out of my face.

370
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Wait, hold it.

371
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
She's not in
the bathroom, Mr. Guthrie.

372
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I looked ev...
You're bleeding.

373
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Tom?

374
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
He's bleeding.

375
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Tom, are you okay?

376
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Uh...

377
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Think you need stitches?

378
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It looks a lot worse than it is.

379
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Your dinner is getting cold.

380
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Didn't mom say
when she's coming back?

381
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Did she hit you?

382
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
What?

383
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Is that why
she's not coming back?

384
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Ike, this has nothing to do
with your mother.

385
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
This

386
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
here happened

387
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
because I had words
with a student.

388
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Okay?

389
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What did you do to him?

390
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Well, we don't need
to go into that now.

391
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Did they put him in jail?

392
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Well, I have
no doubt that's
in his future.

393
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Right now, he's suspended
for the week.

394
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
That's the whole story.

395
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
There's nothing more
to report.

396
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Can we eat?

397
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm not hungry.

398
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Ike?

399
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Hello, mother.

400
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Is something wrong?

401
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
No. We just wanted
to see you.

402
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Come on.

403
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I wasn't expecting anyone.

404
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Did your father send you here?

405
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
No.

406
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
He doesn't even
know we came.

407
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
How is he?

408
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Dad? He's okay.

409
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Does he ask about me?

410
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
We talk about you.

411
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
What do you say?

412
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
We say we miss you,

413
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
we wonder how you are.

414
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
When do you think
you'll be coming home?

415
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I can't say about that.

416
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
He mustn't rush me.

417
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I need time.

418
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
We brought
you something.

419
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
What are those?

420
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
They're for you.

421
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Open them.

422
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Wow.

423
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You're supposed to
drop those in the tub.

424
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Those are from me.

425
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
The perfume's from...

426
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Let her open it first.

427
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
If you don't like them,
we can return them.

428
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
No.

429
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I like them.

430
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I like them very much.

431
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Come here.

432
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Come here.

433
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Thank you.

434
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Hey, there.

435
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Hey.

436
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I understand you're meeting

437
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
with Beckman's parents
on Thursday?

438
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Oh, that's crowder's meeting.

439
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'm only showing up as evidence.

440
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Well, if you need any support,

441
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I can furnish a long list
of reasons

442
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
why that kid should be
permanently suspended.

443
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I think my face says it all.

444
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
But thank you.

445
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You have a hard time
letting anyone help you out,

446
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
don't you, Mr. Guthrie?

447
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Look, I may be stepping
out of bounds here.

448
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's really none of my business,

449
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
but...

450
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
When my marriage fell apart,

451
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I didn't have a whole lot
of people to talk to.

452
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
A whole lot of folks around here
were offering to help, but

453
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
all they really wanted
to do was take sides.

454
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I just needed someone to listen.

455
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Okay.

456
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
What are you doing
in this house?

457
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I'm staying with
you, Mr. Jackson.

458
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Remember?

459
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Good night.

460
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Who said you could
just come in here?

461
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You get out, or I'll
call the police.

462
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Mr. Jackson,
your daughter invited me here.

463
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That's a filthy lie.

464
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You're a thief.

465
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And you've no
business in here.

466
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You hear me?

467
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Dad?

468
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
You get out of here.

469
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Dad, what are you doing?

470
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
She wants my bank key,
that's what she wants.

471
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Dad, calm down.
This is Victoria.

472
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I can't take much more of this.

473
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Dad, it's okay.

474
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Let's get
you to bed.

475
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It's Victoria.

476
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You met her
this morning.

477
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Did he hurt you?

478
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I'm fine.

479
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
But miss Jonas,

480
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I think I have to go
somewhere else.

481
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And he doesn't like me.

482
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Oh, it's not you.

483
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
He doesn't know you.

484
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
He scares me.

485
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Yeah, okay.

486
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You're going to

487
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
freeze yourself
standing there, miss Jonas.

488
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Are you lost?

489
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I hope not.

490
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Can I get you a
cup of coffee?

491
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Oh, I don't want to put you
to any trouble.

492
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's no trouble.

493
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm not making fresh.

494
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
How's your father?

495
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Oh, same.

496
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Well, a little worse.

497
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
But I didn't come out here
to talk about that.

498
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm here to ask you a favor.

499
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
There's a girl I know.

500
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
She's in trouble,

501
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and you might be able
to help her.

502
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
What's wrong with her?

503
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
She need money?

504
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
No, she needs a whole lot more
than that.

505
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
She's 17,
and four months pregnant.

506
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Don't she have any family?

507
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
No. Her mom threw her out.

508
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Well, what about the sire?

509
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Evidently, he wants nothing
to do with her.

510
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Or the baby.

511
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
All right, then.

512
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You got our attention.

513
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
If you don't want money,
what do you want?

514
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I want you to think
about taking this girl in.

515
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Letting her live with you.

516
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Money would be
a whole lot easier.

517
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I get...
I think I
lost it. Okay.

518
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Don't take mine.

519
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Mine are here.

520
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Okay.

521
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I got some more.

522
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Oh, yes.
You got some more.

523
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You're early.

524
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I wasn't sure if they'd want
to spend the night.

525
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
They do.

526
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Oh.

527
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Ow.
Ow.

528
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah. They told you?

529
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah.

530
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Don't ask.

531
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Um...

532
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I was hoping to have this...

533
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Conversation with you
tomorrow morning, but

534
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
seeing as you're...
You're here now...

535
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
What?

536
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
What, what, what?

537
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh. I was hoping

538
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
you weren't going
to be that way.

539
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
What?

540
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
What way?

541
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I didn't want it
to be like this.

542
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Not-not this time.

543
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Why don't you
just tell me

544
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
what's on your mind?

545
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I've decided
to go to Denver for a while

546
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and stay with my sister.

547
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
When are you planning to leave?

548
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
In the morning.

549
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And what about the boys?

550
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I've been thinking about that.

551
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And I think
you should just keep them.

552
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Oh, as opposed
to what I've already been doing?

553
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I know that
you already

554
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
take care of
them yourself.

555
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I can't do anything else
right now.

556
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But I want them
to come and see me.

557
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
When I get settled in,

558
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
after a while.

559
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Have you told them?

560
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
No.

561
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I thought
I'd tell them in the morning.

562
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Don't wait.

563
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
They can handle it.

564
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
All right.

565
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I know what I think.

566
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
What about you?

567
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I say...

568
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
We take her in.

569
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
What are you
talking about?

570
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Look at US.

571
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Living out here,
set in our ways.

572
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
How you going to change
at this age of life?

573
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I can't say that.

574
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
But I'm going to.

575
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
You ever had a girl
live with you before?

576
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You know I haven't.

577
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Well, me, neither.

578
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
But let me tell you--
a girl is different.

579
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
They want things.

580
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Girls got ideas
in their head

581
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
that you and me
can't even imagine.

582
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And what do you
know about babies?

583
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Nothing.

584
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
But I've got time to learn.

585
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Now, look, are you going

586
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
to go in with me
on this thing, or not?

587
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Because i'm...
I'm going to do it.

588
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I'll do it,
not 'cause I want to,

589
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
but I'll make up my mind to it.

590
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
But I'll tell you
one more thing.

591
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
What's that?

592
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You're getting stubborn
and hard to live with.

593
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Oh, that'll be
your bus stop.

594
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
There's a few kids
at granite high

595
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
who live out here.

596
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I can't do this.

597
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
What was that, hon?

598
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I don't even

599
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
know these people.

600
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I've known these men

601
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
all my life.

602
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
You don't need to be afraid.

603
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
They may be a little gruff and

604
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
a little rusty
when it comes to people, but

605
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
it's only 'cause

606
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
they've been
alone for so long.

607
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Vicky, look at me.

608
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You'll be safe out here.

609
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Uh... this here's
the kitchen.

610
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
We're going to go now

611
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
and step into the parlor.

612
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
This room is used
mostly for reading,

613
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
but you can use it
any way you see fit.

614
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Would you like
to see your bedroom?

615
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I would.

616
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
The closet around
there still has
some clothes in it.

617
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
They belonged
to our parents.

618
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Of course, you can
change anything around

619
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
that you want to.

620
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
We don't come in here.

621
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Our bedrooms is upstairs.

622
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
If you want
to take a bath,

623
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
uh...

624
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It's in that,
through that door,

625
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
just under
the stairs there.

626
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
There's a brand
new towel in it, too.

627
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Never been used.

628
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Do you like pink?

629
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Take a look.

630
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
She don't say much.

631
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Do you think
she's scared of US?

632
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Well, if I
didn't know you,

633
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'd be hiding
under that bed.

634
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Woman:
You've already convicted him

635
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
without a trial.

636
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Mrs. Beckman, your son
intimidated a student

637
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and assaulted a teacher.

638
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Our Russell never
said nothing

639
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
to that
half-breed tramp.

640
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
That's enough.
Why don't you
tell him,

641
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
like you told US?

642
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Tell him
what really happened.

643
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I never hit him.
See?

644
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
He grabbed my arm,
I pulled away,

645
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and he fell into a locker.

646
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
More then grabbed him, my boy
had bruises on his arm.

647
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I just want to ask one question.

648
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Is he playing basketball
this weekend or not?

649
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
No, he will not.

650
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
All right, let's go.

651
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm not forgetting this.

652
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You, uh...

653
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Warm enough in that room?

654
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah...

655
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Yeah, it's fine.

656
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Good night.

657
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
She eats
like a bird.

658
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Maybe she
don't like steak.

659
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Well, I had to scrape
most of it to the dog.

660
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Did the dog eat it?

661
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Of course he ate it.

662
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
He's a dog.

663
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Well, not everybody
likes their beef steak

664
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
covered in black pepper.

665
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
What are you saying?

666
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You saying
she don't like my cooking?

667
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I wouldn't know.

668
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
If somebody doesn't
like my cooking,

669
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Harold...

670
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
They ought to speak up.

671
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I ain't running
no restaurant.

672
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Maybe tomorrow
I'll do something
with the chicken.

673
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I thought I was paid up
for the month.

674
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
You are.

675
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Well?
What are you doing here?

676
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Oh, I see.

677
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You came at a good time.

678
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I was just about
to start my baking.

679
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
You can help me out.

680
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Here.

681
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Read the ingredients.

682
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
If you can read,
you can cook.

683
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
That way, you'll always
be able to feed yourselves.

684
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Remember that.

685
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
That's my son.

686
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Albert.

687
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
He died in Korea.

688
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Who's the lady with him?

689
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Who do you
think it is?

690
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Is that you?

691
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Don't sound so shocked.

692
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I wasn't born decrepit.

693
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Where's his father?

694
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
His father was nowhere.
That's where he was.

695
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I have to send
one of you downstairs

696
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
to get a box
of brown sugar.

697
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Take that cup with
the change in it,

698
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and that key
that's hanging there

699
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
from that hook.

700
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
What's it go to?

701
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
The front door.

702
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
You might as well
hold onto it,

703
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I can't be jumping
up and down all day

704
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
answering doors.

705
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Come on. Here.

706
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Our mother moved to Denver.

707
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
We'll be visiting her tomorrow.

708
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Well, I guess you're looking
forward to that, huh?

709
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Crowder expects you to attend
that board meeting on the 17th.

710
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
The beckmans will be there.

711
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And fyi, I am having
a garage sale this weekend.

712
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
My daughter is off
to fort Collins visiting

713
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
her grandma.

714
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I finally have
the house to myself.

715
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Maybe I can talk you into coming
over for a home-cooked meal.

716
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You free on Saturday?

717
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Saturday I'm driving
the boys to Denver to, uh...

718
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Stay with their mother.

719
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Then you're free Saturday night.

720
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Judy...

721
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I'm still married.

722
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So what?

723
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Does that mean
you got to eat alone

724
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
for the rest of your life?

725
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
There you go.

726
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Next.

727
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I'll be right back.

728
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Need a hand with those?

729
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Oh, hi.
No, thanks, I got it.

730
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Oh, good thing
I'm boiling those.

731
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You better
get back in there

732
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
before Harvey gets
too creative with your boys.

733
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Oh, yeah.

734
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I'm just cleaning them up
for a trip to see their mother.

735
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Oh, you all headed
out to Denver?

736
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Yeah, I'm just, uh,
dropping them off.

737
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I got a mountain
of papers to grade.

738
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I'll probably go
stir crazy and head down

739
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
to the shoot for a drink.

740
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Oh, well, maybe
I'll see you there.

741
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Dad?

742
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Okay.
Great.

743
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
You might want
to come in here!

744
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
He's trying to talk Bobby
into getting a military cut.

745
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
See you later.

746
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Okay, boys, finish up.

747
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Hey!

748
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Hi. Hey.

749
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Come on in.

750
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Here, let me take
your bags for you.

751
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I hope you both are hungry,

752
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
'cause I went all out.

753
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I'm going to get some water.

754
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Hi, aunt Janet.

755
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Hi.

756
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I thought they were coming
next week.

757
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Something wrong?

758
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
No, we...

759
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Um... we were
wondering

760
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
what you-you thought
of the market?

761
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
We saw that soybeans

762
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
was down a point
today, but live cattle

763
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
are holding steady.

764
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
What about the pork bellies?

765
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
What?

766
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
The pork bellies.

767
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
You forgot to mention
the pork bellies.

768
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Anyway...

769
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
We wondered
what you thought,

770
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
you know, buy

771
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
or sell?

772
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Oh, I... I really don't know
much about that...

773
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
...um, but maybe

774
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
you could explain it to me...

775
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
If you want to.

776
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Yeah.

777
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Well... the market
is corn and soybeans,
and live cattle.

778
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Those are the futures.

779
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Futures markets are...

780
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
...opening today.

781
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
For a price.

782
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Just what he said.

783
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
So, people buy
and sell them...

784
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Exactly.

785
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Yeah.

786
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
See, what happens here...

787
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Man:
Let's have some music for 'em.

788
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Now dance!

789
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Come on, dance! Come on!

790
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Look at him.

791
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Well, if it ain't Jim McCoy.

792
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I can see by now he's
caused some more bloodshed.

793
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Man 2:
Yeah, thought they were ready
to kill me.

794
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Come on, let's go! Move it!

795
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Yah! Yah!

796
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Tell that story
again, bud.

797
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Okay. Terrell's driving,
and he went crazy...

798
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And the dog, I mean, runs
right in the middle of the road,

799
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
all right, so Terrell slows down
to see if he hit the dog,

800
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
opens his door,
looks back, and falls

801
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
right out of his truck

802
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
on account of him
leaning so far out
with that big gut.

803
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Thank you very much.

804
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Hey, are you out
of here, Tom?

805
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Yep, see you, bud.
Yep.

806
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Know the best
part about it?

807
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Wait a second.
The truck
kept going.

808
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Didn't stop till it hit
Ellen shaddick's Van.
I'm losing my chance, bye.

809
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Tom?

810
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
You're not leaving, are you?

811
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
That was the plan.

812
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Mine, too. You mind
giving me a ride home?

813
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
What about your friend?

814
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Peggy? Shoot, she's just
getting started.

815
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
If I wait for her, I'll never
make it to work on Monday.

816
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Oh, well, come on.

817
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
It's not that far
out of my way.

818
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Thank you

819
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
so much for taking me home
and all.
Oh, come on, now.

820
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
It's no big deal.

821
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Now, my truck's
a little, uh...

822
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Oh. It's a messy truck,

823
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
isn't it?

824
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Oh!

825
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Thank you.

826
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Maybe we should call dad.

827
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
What for?

828
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
What do you want to do?

829
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Where'd you get that?

830
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
What's going on out here?

831
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Nothing.

832
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
What was that?

833
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Was that an egg?

834
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Get inside,
both of you!

835
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
You think that's funny?

836
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
And you wonder why

837
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
your mother hasn't
got the strength
to get dressed?

838
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
You should be ashamed.

839
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

840
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Good night.

841
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
You guys haven't said
much about your weekend.

842
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
What'd you think
of Denver?

843
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
We never left
the apartment.

844
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Aunt Janet works a lot,
and she counts her eggs.

845
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Shh!

846
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
How's your mom?

847
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
She slept.

848
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Mom still has

849
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
a bunch of her clothes
and stuff back at home.

850
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
If she needs 'em...

851
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
We'll send them to her.

852
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I think we should
send 'em soon.

853
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
What do you
think, Victoria?

854
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Yeah. Which one do
you like the best?

855
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
You shouldn't be doing this.

856
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Why? What's the matter?

857
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
We're just having
a little fun,

858
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
and we thought
you were, too.

859
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Yeah...

860
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
...but it's too expensive.

861
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I mean, why are you doing this?

862
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Here, here.

863
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It's clean.

864
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
You can keep it.

865
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
S... sorry.

866
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Hey, there.

867
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I thought the plan
on Saturday night

868
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
was to meet up at the shoot.

869
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
This thing,
between you and Judy,

870
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
where is that headed exactly?

871
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Judy?
Oh, come on,

872
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
how big of a town
do you think this is?

873
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Oh...

874
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I just gave her a ride home.

875
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Nothing happened.

876
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Oh, good...

877
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Because I won't compete
for you, Guthrie.

878
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I will not get into any
kind of contest.

879
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I won't play that game.

880
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Good night.

881
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Good night, Victoria.

882
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Bye, Janine.

883
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Night, sweetie.

884
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I bet you thought
I wouldn't be around

885
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
for my birthday this year.

886
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
And there's my present.

887
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Still baking, huh?

888
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
What are you doing here, Dwayne?

889
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Can we, uh, talk in the car?

890
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
You shouldn't be standing
out here in the cold.

891
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Please?

892
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Tell me why
you came here.

893
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
You want the truth?

894
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I was hoping
I could talk you

895
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
into coming back
to Denver with me.

896
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Why would I do that, Dwayne?

897
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
So we could
take up

898
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
where we left off?

899
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
You're carrying my kid
aren't you?

900
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Yeah, but things have changed.

901
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
You're right. I'm settled now,
and I want to take care of you.

902
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
What you all flinchy for?
I'm not going to bite you.

903
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Did I ever bite you before?

904
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
What am I supposed
to do in Denver?

905
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Shoot, everything
you can't do here.

906
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
They said they saw her
get into some boy's car.

907
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
What do you think?

908
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Your home.

909
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Why don't you go
hang your coat up

910
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
in the bedroom closet?

911
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I'll order US some dinner.

912
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Jonas:
Well, I spoke to Janine
at the diner.

913
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And?

914
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
And I'm almost certain
that was the baby's father.

915
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Maggie, did we do something
that drove her away?

916
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Oh, no, no, I don't think so.

917
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Thanks. Goodbye.

918
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Raymond?

919
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
That calf wants
to come now.

920
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Are you going
to help me?

921
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Or not?

922
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Riding the bus
is a privilege, ma'am.

923
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And if your child's
committed three infractions,

924
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
he loses that privilege.

925
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I understand.

926
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
But I think your bus drivers
need to learn to count to three.

927
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Is there anything
anybody would like

928
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
to add to that
this evening?

929
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Yeah.

930
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
What do you plan
on doing about him?

931
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Mrs. Beckman?

932
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
How's my son
supposed to graduate

933
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
when he's got that
for a teacher?

934
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I can assure you we're doing

935
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
our best to make sure
your son graduates.

936
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
If you make my boy
miss his tournament,

937
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
that is going to cost him
a scholarship.

938
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Excuse me.

939
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Russell Beckman...

940
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Has not completed

941
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
a single assignment,

942
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
nor has he passed a single test

943
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
the entire semester.

944
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
If he's failing,
it's because you
have done nothing

945
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
but pick on him
since the day...
I don't pick on anyone.

946
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I've been a teacher
for 15 years at this school.

947
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
And I can't even remember

948
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
the last time
I had to fail a student.

949
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I will not take the fall
for a student

950
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
who has been raised
on a steady diet of ignorance

951
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
and cruelty to others.

952
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Did you hear what
he said about him?

953
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
You keep talking, mister,

954
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
you'll be defending yourself
in a court of law!

955
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Tom?

956
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
That was quite
a speech you gave.

957
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Lloyd, I never intended
to make a speech.

958
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
No, but you did.
Now it's my turn.

959
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
When that Beckman kid
comes back in your class,

960
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
you're going to pass him.

961
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I want him
out of here

962
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
and graduated, you hear me?

963
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Have a good night, Tom.

964
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
How'd it go?

965
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
He wants me
to start tomorrow.

966
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Excellent.

967
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
He make you buy this?

968
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
He didn't make me,
I wanted it.

969
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Why? You live here now.

970
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Maybe I want
to send it to somebody.

971
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Who?
Those old men?

972
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Can you just turn
on the heat, please?

973
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
How you going to send something
if you don't have no address?

974
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Come on,
have another one.

975
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Girl:
Grow up!

976
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Oh, he looked
so stupid...

977
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
...he looked so stupid.

978
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
...so stupid.

979
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
...so stupid.

980
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
...so stupid... ...So stupid...

981
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Are you sure
they're here?

982
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
You're the one
who left, honey.

983
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I mean, do you think

984
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
they're even going
to take me back?

985
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I don't know.

986
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
You'll have
to ask them.

987
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I'm afraid
of what they're going to say.

988
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Well, they're not going
to say anything

989
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
if you just sit in the car.

990
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Go on.

991
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
It's me.

992
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I came back.

993
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
So, uh, I just wanted...

994
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I was wondering if...

995
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
If I could live here again
with you.

996
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Anyway, um, you know,
I just wanted to say thank you

997
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
and... you know,
for all you did,

998
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
and to say that I'm really sorry
for all the trouble I caused.

999
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
You were good to me.

1000
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I won't be bothering you again.

1001
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
We can't have you leaving
like that again.

1002
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
That's got to be understood.

1003
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
You better come in.

1004
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
It's cold out here.

1005
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Mrs. Stearns?

1006
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
We picked up your groceries.

1007
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Mrs. Stearns?

1008
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Mrs. Stearns?

1009
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
It's US.

1010
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Feel her.

1011
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Why?

1012
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Just go ahead.

1013
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I want to touch her again.

1014
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
You ready to go?

1015
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Yeah.

1016
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Dad's not home.

1017
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I don't want to stay here
without him.

1018
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Boys?

1019
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Ike?

1020
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Bobby?

1021
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
You okay?

1022
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Yeah.

1023
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I'm cold.

1024
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Who is that out there?

1025
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Is that the Guthrie boys?

1026
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Yes, sir.

1027
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Well, what in
the world are...?

1028
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Is your father
with you?

1029
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
No, sir.

1030
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Did you boys

1031
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
ride that poor horse out here
all by yourselves?

1032
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Are you lost?

1033
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
No, sir.

1034
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Do you guys
like grape juice?

1035
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Mm-hmm.

1036
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Thank you.

1037
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Thank you.

1038
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
You're welcome.

1039
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Tell me if
you want some more.

1040
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
There's no answer.

1041
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Call Maggie.

1042
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Hey, Maggie?

1043
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

1044
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Can I use
your phone?

1045
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
If this is about your boys,
I know where they are.

1046
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
They rode their horse

1047
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
all the way out to
the mcpheron ranch.

1048
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Hello.

1049
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Harold? It's Tom.

1050
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I understand
you got my boys out there?

1051
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
We sure do.

1052
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Are they all right?

1053
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
It appears like it.

1054
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
They seem pretty
quiet, though.

1055
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Harold, can I,
could you put on ike?

1056
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Ike,

1057
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
it's your dad.

1058
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Hello?

1059
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Ike, what are you doing
out there?

1060
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
We're having dinner.

1061
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Are you all right?

1062
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
We're just eating dinner.

1063
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Ike?

1064
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Hello?

1065
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Ike?

1066
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Tom, I...

1067
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I just wonder if you don't want

1068
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
to leave them out here
for a while.

1069
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
You could come out
in the morning and get them.

1070
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
No, I'm coming out there
right now.

1071
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
He wants them to
spend the night.

1072
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Tom, sit still.

1073
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Your boys aren't doing
any more riding tonight.

1074
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I promise you, by the time
you get out here,

1075
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
we'll all be asleep.

1076
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Come in the morning.

1077
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Don't forget the
horse trailer.

1078
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Don't forget
the horse trailer.

1079
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
And Tom?

1080
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Don't worry about your boys.

1081
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
If it's one thing we know,
it's brothers.

1082
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Can I get you another?

1083
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
No, thanks, i'm-I'm good.

1084
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Why would they ride
all the way out there?

1085
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
They only met
those guys once.

1086
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
They must have liked
what they saw.

1087
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Why are you stuck on that?

1088
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
If my own kids
are looking for comfort

1089
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
from strangers, Maggie,

1090
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
they're sending
a pretty clear sign that...

1091
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
That what,

1092
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
you're a bad father?

1093
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Oh, come on, Tom.

1094
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Your boys think the sun rises
and sets on your shoulders.

1095
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
You don't know
how lucky you are.

1096
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Well...

1097
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Thanks.

1098
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
For being home.

1099
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Tom, is Ella
coming back?

1100
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
No.

1101
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Do you still want her to?

1102
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I can't say.

1103
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Take your time.

1104
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
You'll sort it out.

1105
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Drive safe.

1106
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Vicky:
Please don't wake them up.

1107
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Raymond:
Wait a minute.

1108
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I better check on those boys.

1109
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Oh!

1110
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Let me tell you something,
all right?

1111
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I knew this heifer
that we had,

1112
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
and she got a-a long

1113
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
piece of fence wire stuck
down her

1114
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
some way.

1115
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
But it didn't hurt her.

1116
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Didn't hurt the calf.

1117
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And it was
a good-sized calf, too...

1118
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
As I recall.

1119
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Woman: Dr.
 Brooks to labor and delivery.

1120
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Dr. Brooks to labor
and delivery, please.

1121
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Hey.

1122
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Maybe you two should
wait in the hall.

1123
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Where did that story come from?

1124
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
What story?

1125
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
About the heifer
swallowing the fence wire.

1126
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I don't remember that.

1127
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I made it up.

1128
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
You made it up?

1129
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
And what else are you going
to make up?

1130
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Whatever I have to.

1131
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Gentlemen, you may
as well go on home.

1132
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
I don't expect this baby wants
to come for a while.

1133
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Why? What's wrong?

1134
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Oh, nothing's wrong.

1135
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
It's her first child.

1136
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
It's very common
to have a long labor.

1137
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
There's no good reason
for you to be here.

1138
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I can call you.

1139
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
No, thank you.

1140
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
We're not moving
from here

1141
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
until that baby is
born good and healthy

1142
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
and that girl in
there is okay.

1143
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
What are you doing?

1144
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I'm going home.

1145
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
No, you're not.

1146
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Dad's coming for US
in the morning.

1147
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
I'm going home.

1148
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Why?

1149
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
We shouldn't have come.

1150
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Hey, it's Guthrie's kids.

1151
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Hey!

1152
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Isn't it past your
bedtime, little girls?

1153
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
You ain't going
to get too far

1154
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
on that tired piece
of horsemeat.

1155
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
You want
to jump in?

1156
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
He asked you a question,
little girls.

1157
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
No, we don't.

1158
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Oh, really? Well,
that's too bad.

1159
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
'Cause you're
doing it anyway.

1160
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Let go of me!
Let go!

1161
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Put me down.

1162
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Get in there.
Get in there!

1163
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Girl:
Russell?

1164
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Go, go!
What are
you doing?

1165
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Someone's going to see US.

1166
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Whoo!

1167
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
One of US needs to go home

1168
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
and check on those boys.

1169
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And it's almost time to feed.

1170
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I said, one...

1171
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I'll be back.

1172
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
All right now, go on.

1173
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Get out!

1174
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
They're just kids, Russell.

1175
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Why don't you take them back?

1176
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
You can't make
them walk from here.

1177
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Yeah, you keep that up,
you're going to be joining them.

1178
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Get over
there.
Hey!

1179
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
You little girls
can go home now, okay?

1180
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Wait! Let me go.

1181
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
But I don't want
to hear you

1182
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
crying to nobody
about this.

1183
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I don't want
to think

1184
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
about what I'll
do next time.

1185
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Hey, wait a second.

1186
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Is that all
we're going to do?

1187
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
What, you
got something
else in mind?

1188
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Go, go, go!

1189
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Come over here.
Come here, come here.

1190
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Charlene:
What's going on?

1191
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Oh!

1192
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Little punk bit me,

1193
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
that's what's going on.

1194
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Go, go!

1195
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Russell!

1196
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Come on, come
on, come on!

1197
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Get his pants off.

1198
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Russell, let's just go, please.

1199
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
You guys, put him down!

1200
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Get his shirt,
get his shirt.

1201
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
I got his shirt,
I got his shirt.

1202
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I got his shirt!

1203
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Charlene:
Russell, you're scaring me.

1204
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
He don't look
so tough,

1205
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
now, does he?
Oh, yeah.

1206
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Bobby:
Put him down.

1207
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Take his shoes off.

1208
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Get his shoes...
I got 'em.

1209
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Take 'em off.

1210
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
All right, throw
it, throw it.

1211
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Get his shirt,
get his shirt!

1212
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Go, go, go, go, go!

1213
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Go, come on.

1214
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Whoo!

1215
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Come on, let's go.
Let's get out of here.

1216
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Just remember,
you talk, you die.

1217
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Come on, let's go,
let's get out of here.

1218
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Oh!

1219
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Come on babe,
let's go.

1220
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Charlene,
let's go.

1221
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Come on, get in.

1222
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Yeah.

1223
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Ooh!

1224
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Oh!

1225
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Oh.

1226
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
You all right?

1227
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
They hurt you?

1228
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I can't find my shoes.

1229
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Where did they throw them?

1230
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Over there, somewhere.

1231
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Forget them.

1232
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
We'll come back tomorrow.

1233
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
I'm not coming back here
tomorrow.

1234
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Hello?

1235
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Harold:
Tom, you got your boys there
with you?

1236
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
No.

1237
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I'm going to go back out
and look for them.

1238
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I thought they were staying
out there with you.

1239
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Woman: Dr.
 Lawrence to room 336, please.

1240
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Let's get her
up there quick.

1241
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Tom Mayer to physical therapy.

1242
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Ike?

1243
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Bobby?

1244
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Are you all right?

1245
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
What happened?

1246
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Where were you?

1247
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Where were you?

1248
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
One of you better
start talking here.

1249
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
What?

1250
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
They... they...

1251
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
They...
Who's they?

1252
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
They who?

1253
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
We were... car...

1254
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Who, who, who, who, who?

1255
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Harold, can they stay
with you for a little bit?

1256
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I need to make a stop.

1257
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Hey, you want to
hear the radio?

1258
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Mrs. Stearns died.

1259
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Who?

1260
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Mrs. Stearns, the lady who lived
above the barber shop.

1261
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
We delivered her papers.

1262
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Well, how do you know?

1263
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
We saw her yesterday.

1264
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
She was dead then.

1265
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
And we left her
like that all night,

1266
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
but somebody has
to do something about it.

1267
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
We can't
just leave her there.

1268
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
You?

1269
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
What do you want?

1270
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Tell Russell
to come on out here.

1271
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
What's this
about, Guthrie?

1272
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Your son hurt my
boys last night.

1273
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I intend to talk to him
about it.

1274
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
What are you talking about?

1275
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
You tell him
to come on out here.

1276
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Go get him.

1277
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
He's sleeping.

1278
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Well, get him up.

1279
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Now, you tell him
in front of US

1280
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
what this is all about.

1281
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
What do you say happened?

1282
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
You finally went too far,
didn't you?

1283
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
You've hurt my
two boys now.

1284
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
You and that Murphy kid

1285
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
took them out in the country
and scared them...

1286
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
...and then you thought
it would be smart

1287
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
if you took their pants off
and left them

1288
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
out there

1289
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
to walk home?!

1290
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Russell,

1291
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
do you know
anything about this?
No, i-i

1292
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I don't know
what he's talking about.

1293
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I mean, I don't even know

1294
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
his kids, dad.
Yeah, you do.

1295
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

1296
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I wouldn't know his kids

1297
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
if they were standing
right in front of me.

1298
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Get this guy out of here.

1299
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
You... you leave...

1300
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Let go of him!
You leave my boys alone.

1301
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
You hear me?

1302
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
You got a problem with me,

1303
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
you come to me!

1304
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
You see me about it!

1305
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Do you hear me?

1306
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Get out of here!

1307
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I'm going to kill him.

1308
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Shut up, Doris.
Oh...

1309
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
What's going on here?

1310
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Well, who's going
to tell me?

1311
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Guthrie here

1312
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
attacked my boy.

1313
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
He's come right to the house
with some dirty,

1314
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
rotten lie about my boy

1315
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
and-and his kids.

1316
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Is that right, Tom?
Is that what happened?

1317
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Don't you ever

1318
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
touch them again,
you stinking,

1319
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
rotten coward.

1320
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
I will do whatever I want

1321
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
to your snot-nosed
little punks.
Russell.

1322
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
No, he's trying to act
like daddy of the year

1323
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
right now, so what are
your kids doing

1324
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
on the highway at 4:00
in the morning?

1325
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Mr. Mcpheron,

1326
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
you can go and see her

1327
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
if you like.

1328
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Well, um... Victoria?

1329
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Yes.

1330
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Victoria's okay?

1331
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
She's tired,

1332
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
but she's doing fine.

1333
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Don't you
want to know

1334
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
about the baby?

1335
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
What is it?

1336
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
It's a girl.

1337
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Do you want to hold her?

1338
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Oh, I don't know about that.

1339
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Oh, just go on.

1340
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Support her head. It'll be fine.

1341
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
There.

1342
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,000
My hands might be
too rough.

1343
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Well, she's got to get
used to you sometime.

1344
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Hey...

1345
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Ooh...

1346
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,000
You know, I never counted
on her being a girl...

1347
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
So I reckon it's something
we can get used to.

1348
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Knock, knock.

1349
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Oh...

1350
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
She's the sweetest
thing I've ever seen.

1351
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Harold:
Let's take
this little lady home.

1352
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
It's a girl!

1353
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Oh, you left out

1354
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
this part of
the story.

1355
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
How many teeth did you lose
this time?

1356
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Oh, this is more
of a... kidney thing.

1357
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Ow.

1358
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Tom:
The good news is
I got that punk

1359
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
to be honest for the first time
in his life.

1360
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
The bad news is that they'll
probably still reward him

1361
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
with a diploma.

1362
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Ooh...

1363
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Tom, are you sure
you're okay?

1364
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Oh, I've been worse.

1365
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
What?

1366
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
You weren't looking
to go dancing tonight, were you?

1367
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
No, I figured
we'd just sit by the fire

1368
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
and count your bruises.

1369
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Yeah, these people
are hungry.

1370
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Hey, what do you got here?

1371
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Hey!

1372
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Tom:
Oh, that smells good.

1373
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
What do you got there?

1374
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Well, I wish I could
say I made it myself,

1375
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,000
but I can't, and it's
probably a good thing.

1376
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Oh...
Her first
little cake.

1377
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
All she does is sleep.
Look at that. Cute.

1378
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Well, she had
quite a journey.

1379
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Thank you.
Let me get
something to eat.

1380
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I think that's it.

1381
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Well, doesn't this look great?

1382
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Victoria:
I am hungry.

1383
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I got it.
Harold:
I got it.

1384
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Want a burger?
Yeah.

1385
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Dad, give her back.

1386
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1387
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
She didn't get
you food yet.

1388
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
These look great. And buns.

1389
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Harold:
Thank you very much.

1390
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Victoria:
This looks so good...
