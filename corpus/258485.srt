1
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:32,036
- Richard. Hold it. Richard,
what's the matter?
- Okay. What happened?

2
00:00:32,127 --> 00:00:35,597
I'm not selling these skis to my mother.
Please, a more neon sound.

3
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:37,803
- Mr Ron, I can't be waiting at the whim...
- Remember: to be free...

4
00:00:37,887 --> 00:00:40,196
- ofyour attorney.
- to soar like an eagle, to slip
the surly bonds of Earth.

5
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:43,836
- All right. Thankyou.
- Right? That's the feel.

6
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:47,044
Here we go.

7
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:58,406
- The guys are tired, you know?
No, ifthey start losing...
- Well, ifthe guys are tired...

8
00:00:58,487 --> 00:01:00,478
- their chops-- All right.
- it sounds that way in the ad, my dear.

9
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:03,525
- All right. They've never
let you down before,Jimmy.
- Cut!

10
00:01:03,607 --> 00:01:06,246
- They've never let you down before.
- Uh, Richard, listen.

11
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:10,764
We talked about this yesterday, and
l-l'm not getting the sound
that we, uh, we're looking for.

12
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:14,601
Look, we're alltired, but, you know,
we might as wellnot be recording this...

13
00:01:14,687 --> 00:01:16,962
unless we'regonnaget
somepunch. Now, maybe...

14
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:21,199
- myearsare clogged
orsomething, but, uh, it'sa--
-Jimmy, we--

15
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:23,596
- We agreed on this yesterday.
- Say it. What? What? Tellme.

16
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:25,882
We've been playing a long time.
Okay? We need a lunch break.

17
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:30,006
Why don't wejust get through
one track, one take...

18
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:32,237
and then give us
your notes, okay?

19
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:34,921
- Okay, but, you know, I want-- Holdit.
- We can fiîx it in the mix.

20
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:38,363
We can do it in the mix, but l-l-l want
to hear it in the performance too.

21
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:39,675
- How's it going?
-Just, just surge.

22
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,156
- No, that's fiîne. I'll hold.
- I want a-- Whee!

23
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:44,636
-Jimmy!
- Wha-- Richard, look. At the risk--

24
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:49,801
It's not the fucking "Leonora Overture,"
okay? It's a jingle.

25
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:53,482
Just let us get
through it once, okay?

26
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:57,003
And then we'll have lunch
and then we'll have notes...

27
00:01:57,087 --> 00:02:00,238
and then we'll fiîx it
in the mix, okay?

28
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:25,838
Mom wants you
to come home right now!

29
00:03:25,927 --> 00:03:28,646
She's waiting foryou.

30
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:36,636
- Hi.
- Hi.

31
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:03,921
Ifshe can standit, lcan.
Play it.

32
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:06,077
Yes, boss.

33
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:32,481
I think we should apologize
toJimmy Schwartz tomorrow.

34
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,926
- Get ready, pull.
- Sweet.

35
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:45,601
Pull.

36
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,038
Wish for something expensive.

37
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:02,363
- Mom.
- Mom.

38
00:05:02,447 --> 00:05:04,881
- Okay.
- Goodbye. Take care ofyourself.

39
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:08,403
- All right. You take care.
Say hi to your mom.
- Nice party, Mrs Parker.

40
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:12,196
-You're welcome. You're welcome.
-Thanks for coming.
-Good night.

41
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:23,565
I guess we have
new neighbours, eh?

42
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:12,558
Hey, you mind
if I run along with you?

43
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:14,877
No, be my guest.
Richard Parker.

44
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:18,164
Oh, hey, Eddy Otis.

45
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:21,159
Where's your beautiful
daughter today?

46
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,920
She's away at school.

47
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:26,316
She comes home
every other weekend.

48
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:29,046
- Uh, whereabouts?
- It's a couple of hours from here.

49
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:31,925
It's a school for
musically-gifted children.

50
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:35,716
- Oh, you must be very proud.
- You could say.

51
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:41,202
Let me guess. You're in
something to do with the arts.

52
00:06:41,287 --> 00:06:45,200
Maybe graphics,
maybe advertising.

53
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:47,801
No, defiînitely advertising.

54
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:52,841
I'm a composer.
I writejingles for ads.

55
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,440
How'd you guess?

56
00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:58,520
I used to sell insurance.
You get a feel for stuff like that.

57
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:02,282
What do you do?
I'm not even gonna guess.

58
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:06,155
- I give fiînancial advice.
- Oh, like what?

59
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:09,398
- Okay, health clubs.
- Good, huh?

60
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:12,160
- Lousy, trust me.
- Oh.

61
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:13,965
Home security?

62
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:16,197
- Better?
- Oh, much better.

63
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:19,723
He said they didn't know anyone, that they
were lonely. What could I say?

64
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,958
- Do you need these?
- Mmm.

65
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:25,800
And this.

66
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:28,640
I know how you feel about neighbours,
but it's only drinks.

67
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:31,924
- I don't drink.
- Since when?

68
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:35,124
I thought I was getting fat.

69
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:39,359
- You didn't notice.
- What? The getting fat
or the not drinking?

70
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:41,358
...Jamaica for the weekend
scuba diving.

71
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:44,359
Anyway, on our way to the airport
to come back and move houses...

72
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:48,281
we get caught up in a riot.
I swear to God, a riot.

73
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,757
It was fascinating. While I'm
so busy protecting my wife...

74
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:55,237
I don't notice them
stealing all the luggage.

75
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:58,876
Hence, the outfiît when we arrived.
Everything else was packed.

76
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:02,084
- Have you never been in a riot, Priscilla?
- Sorry I'm late.

77
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,446
I'm Katherine,
but everybody calls me Kay.

78
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:15,566
Kay, this is Richard Parker
and his lovely wife Priscilla.

79
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:19,799
The way I look at life, the way I look at it
is this: money is like blood.

80
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:22,447
It's no big deal,
but ifyou want to live...

81
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,200
you've gotta have a lot of it pumping
through the system. For example...

82
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:28,677
most people will never know what it's like
to drive a boat at 1 00 miles an hour...

83
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:32,806
or go toJamaica for the weekend or see
the Grand Canyon from a hot air balloon.

84
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,243
You see what I'm saying?
Without money...

85
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:38,283
you shrivel up.

86
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:43,202
So how do you explain all those
shrivelled-up, rich people?

87
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:45,847
I'll tell you how.
Because those people...

88
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:49,636
they know how to make money, but
they don't know how to spend it.

89
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:53,799
Gettin' money's easy.

90
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,563
We have to talk.

91
00:08:56,647 --> 00:08:58,956
- What would you invest in?
- Myself?

92
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:03,916
- Yeah.
- Drug and alcohol rehab centres.

93
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:09,161
I'm serious. It's the number one investment
op ofthe '90s. Priscilla, people are sheep.

94
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:12,398
You tell them they can't quit on their own
and suddenly everybody needs help.

95
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:15,047
I mean, the human mind.
What can you say?

96
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:17,038
You know what I'd do
if I had some serious money?

97
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:19,963
Misery

98
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,682
Come on, help me out here.

99
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:41,045
Don'tput no headstone
on mygrave

100
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:47,759
Allmy life
I've been a slave

101
00:09:50,447 --> 00:09:55,441
Andldon't want
the worldto know

102
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:02,836
Here lies the fool
who lovesyouso

103
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:11,243
Free from allthis

104
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,558
Misery

105
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:54,207
Richard.

106
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:57,357
Come to bed.

107
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:07,601
You know, me and Kay were saying,
you two have really got it made:

108
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:11,157
a nice home, a nice business,
a beautiful, talented daughter...

109
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:13,761
a great marriage.

110
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,483
- I'm very lucky.
- What's the trick?

111
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:22,606
- To which?
- Marriage. How do you hold it
all together?

112
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:24,882
Trust, I guess.

113
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:28,566
Trust.

114
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,320
That's very interesting.

115
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:33,443
You know, I'm planning this trip down
to South Carolina this weekend.

116
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:36,325
I'm gonna fly down in my plane.
I got some property to check out.

117
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:39,080
- Why don't you and Priscilla come along?
- You have a plane?

118
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:41,317
Just a little twin engine Piper.

119
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:43,523
- Well, I'm sure we'd love to but--
- Look, if money's a problem--

120
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:45,677
- No, it's not really the money--
- Well, good. Then we'll have fun.

121
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:49,965
- It'sjus-- Uh. Do you think we ought to--
- Now watch this.

122
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:52,561
Eddy. Careful!

123
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:55,525
Eddy!

124
00:12:47,527 --> 00:12:50,325
Well, let's say 5,000.

125
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:54,878
With 5,000, I'd put one in the bank,
one in bonds and play the stock market
with the rest.

126
00:12:56,047 --> 00:12:59,119
The stock market?

127
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:01,516
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

128
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:04,804
How come you never pursued
a singing career?

129
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:07,799
There's a lot worse voices out there.

130
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,560
I guess Eddy got
all the self-confiîdence.

131
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:15,357
Maybe I could help you. That way
I'd get to play some blues, and, uh...

132
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:19,082
You know, you--

133
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:28,079
I would take this wall out.

134
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:31,762
You know, take it out, make this
whole area screened in.

135
00:13:31,847 --> 00:13:34,202
It would open it up a lot and then put
like blue shutters on it or something...

136
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:36,243
to give it a bit of life,
you know?

137
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:39,763
It could use it.

138
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:42,156
- What?
- Nothing. Go ahead.

139
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:44,397
- I'm being my usual self, right?
- No, I like it.

140
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:46,762
I'm gonna take over.

141
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:49,122
Oh, never mind.
Come on.

142
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:53,566
I'm surprised Priscilla hasn't tried
to sell offsome of her investments.

143
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:56,559
She was up to 1 5,000
last time I went over it.

144
00:13:56,647 --> 00:13:59,081
Fifteen from fiîve?

145
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,318
She has a good head on her shoulders.
What can I tell you?
Squeeze when you come up.

146
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:07,401
That fiîve was a gift left by an uncle to go
towards a sailboat. Can't touch that.

147
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:10,479
How much do you owe?

148
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:13,035
It's not that much, Eddy.
Let's not talk about it.

149
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:16,802
No, Richard, I'm serious. Maybe
I can be ofsome help here.

150
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:19,355
You can't, believe me.

151
00:14:19,447 --> 00:14:23,406
Is there anything we can't
talk about? Now, come on.

152
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,000
- You really wanna know?
- Yes.

153
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:29,160
Current debts, credit cards,
bank loans, about 25,000.

154
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:34,520
Is that all? I can get
you that in an afternoon.

155
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,846
How?

156
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:40,442
Leave it to me, Bubbi.
Three to six weeks, okay?

157
00:14:40,527 --> 00:14:42,518
- What-What kind of interest
are we talking about?
- No kind of interest.

158
00:14:42,607 --> 00:14:46,964
I don't loan money
to my friends. It's a gift.

159
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:51,757
Our greatest glory, Dicky boy, is not in
never falling but in rising every time we fall.

160
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:54,805
Oh! Do you see? Now you left yourself
open for that one. You deserved it.

161
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:58,118
Now, come on. Come on. That's it.
Come on. That's right. Come on.

162
00:14:58,207 --> 00:15:01,563
Come on. That's it. That's it.
That's it. Hit mine. That's it. Come on.

163
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:03,717
Come on. Keep it in. Keep it in.
All right, now, keep it--

164
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:15,916
Oh, my God!

165
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:23,920
- Oh, my God. Eddy.
- Call an ambulance.
- Oh, Richard.

166
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,238
- Thankyou, Dr Pettering.
- Talk to you tomorrow.

167
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:32,519
- You know how to reach us.
- Call ifyou need anything.

168
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,962
I will. Thanks a lot.

169
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:37,038
Take care.

170
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:40,437
- Oh, my God.
- Poor guy. I feel terrible.

171
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:42,358
He didn't look as bad as I thought.
You know, but he--

172
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:44,438
Didn't he say he was coming
to take us out to dinner?

173
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:48,843
- Now.
- Okay, everybody, fiîve minutes.

174
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:50,679
- Okay.
- Priscilla?

175
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:54,476
- Baby, I fudged.
- Could you come here and help me?

176
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:57,035
Sure. Sure.
What is it?

177
00:15:57,127 --> 00:16:00,722
I-l'd like to get up. I've been lying
in the same position too long.

178
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:03,275
Okay. Okay. Here.
You grab on to me.

179
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:06,882
- Okay. Be careful, please.
- I will, dear. I will. Now, on three, okay?

180
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:10,004
- Okay. Wait.
- Ready? One, two--

181
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:11,998
- Up we go.
- Wait, slow.

182
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:14,157
Go slow.

183
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:16,397
- Are you all right? There you go.
- Yeah.

184
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:18,637
- There you go! Okay, Richard.
- Ow! Ow!

185
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:22,606
- Ow! Don't touch me. Don't.
- Richard.

186
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:25,042
Just give me a little air.

187
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:28,642
I can't move.

188
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:32,601
I can't move.

189
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:37,760
Or can l?

190
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:54,600
- Oh!
- Ah.

191
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:59,159
Oh, that's-that's
much better. Well--

192
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:03,557
Well, what's this?

193
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,320
Your insurance company.

194
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:09,479
Neck and back
scares the shit out ofthem.

195
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:15,005
I'm in the business, pal. It was easy.
I got this pet doctor. It was nothing.

196
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:20,480
Oh, I'm gonna keep fiîve
ifthat's okay with you guys.

197
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:23,764
Yes, Priscilla.

198
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:25,678
It's true.

199
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:28,565
It-lt was a scam.
And I'm--

200
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,366
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

201
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:33,961
You broke the law, Eddy.

202
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:36,242
For us?

203
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:38,887
What are friends for?

204
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:42,277
Oh, I don't think we can
accept this. We appreciate it.

205
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:46,804
- We really do.
- I love this woman.
"I don't think we can accept it"?

206
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:49,447
It's not that we don't
need the money.

207
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:53,236
Priscilla, please, don't insult me.

208
00:17:53,327 --> 00:17:56,319
I did this foryou.
Foryou.

209
00:17:58,087 --> 00:17:59,918
Now, come on.

210
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:03,238
I've been wearing
that neck brace for weeks.

211
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:05,921
What do you say?

212
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:12,405
I don't know what to say.

213
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:16,406
But thanks.

214
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,997
Can't sleep?

215
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,237
No.

216
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:12,886
You think too much.

217
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:17,122
What about you?

218
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:26,727
Is Priscilla asleep?

219
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:30,477
What about Eddy?

220
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:33,206
No.

221
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:38,077
He's at the Watkins', you know,
the people that own the cabins.

222
00:19:43,687 --> 00:19:46,679
Probably trying to buy the place.

223
00:19:48,247 --> 00:19:50,920
Always looking for a deal.

224
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:02,077
How long you been married?
Thirteen?

225
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,635
Fourteen years.

226
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:14,596
Have you been faithful
all those years?

227
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:20,647
Yeah.
What about you?

228
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:27,043
I guess I'm kind of
old-fashioned that way.

229
00:20:35,007 --> 00:20:38,966
I guess we both are, huh?

230
00:20:39,207 --> 00:20:41,357
- Baby, yeah
- Lori?

231
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:43,483
- Hi, honey, it's Mom.
- I wannajump in the middle

232
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:45,523
- Yeah, we're in a bar.
- And wallowaround

233
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:47,677
- Andkeep on drinkin'till
lfeellike I'm drowned
- No, it's very, very nice.

234
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:50,156
- Honey, we decided to stay
another night, all right?
- I want apiece oftheparty

235
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:53,922
- So ifyou need anything--
- AndpartytiIllsee the light

236
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:57,556
- Go on. Go on.
- I want apiece oftheparty

237
00:20:57,647 --> 00:21:01,606
- AndpartytiIllsee the light
- I'm gonna talk to the guy,
and you're gonna do it.

238
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:22,564
Give 'em hell.

239
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:35,726
Aslreach out toyou

240
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:40,804
Like a child woulddo

241
00:21:41,727 --> 00:21:47,165
Darling, don't let me down

242
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:54,685
Iloveyouso

243
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:57,998
Andlguessyou know

244
00:21:58,087 --> 00:22:02,524
That I'm too fargone

245
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:05,280
To turn around

246
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:09,081
You wanna fuck my wife,
don't you?

247
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:13,365
- Iflgiveyou myheart
- Oh, don't look so scared, Richard.
It's no big deal.

248
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:16,007
-Most guys want to fuck my wife.
- Please don't telephone

249
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:18,157
I've kind of gotten
used to the idea.

250
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:22,638
- Don't treat me like dirt on theground
- As it happens...

251
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:26,276
I'm not entirely immune
to that kind ofthought myself.

252
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:30,565
Give me a break

253
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:33,480
- Forheaven's sake
- I mean, nobody wants to blow
their marriage, God forbid.

254
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:37,355
- But God.
- 'Cause I'm too fargone

255
00:22:37,447 --> 00:22:42,521
- Forjust one night.
- To turn around

256
00:22:42,607 --> 00:22:46,805
- Wouldn't that be sweet?
- I'm too fargone

257
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:51,756
- You are insane, Eddy, fucking insane.
- Forbacking up now

258
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:56,523
- I'm too fargone
- And so safe.

259
00:22:56,607 --> 00:22:59,644
- To stop
- Let me askyou something.

260
00:22:59,727 --> 00:23:03,720
- I'm flyinghigh
- You ever wake up in
the middle ofthe night and...

261
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:07,356
- Like a bird up in thesky
- you know, just sort ofdo it?

262
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:10,678
- Like, halfasleep?
- Darling

263
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:14,680
- Yeah, sure.
- Don't let me down

264
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:17,998
I wonder what
would happen if...

265
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:21,921
- you and I got up in the middle
ofthe night, went next door...
- Don't make ityou

266
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:26,922
- and crept into the other man's bedroom?
- Whateveryou do

267
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:30,716
- Oh, don't turn my life
- Would they know the difference?

268
00:23:30,807 --> 00:23:34,004
Upside down

269
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:35,600
I think so.

270
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:39,965
- Ineedyouso
- And would they mind? Richard,
take a look.

271
00:23:40,047 --> 00:23:43,437
- Andlguessyou know
- They want exactly what we want.

272
00:23:43,527 --> 00:23:47,645
- That I'm too fargone
- In the heat ofthe moment, they'll love it.

273
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:51,356
To turn around

274
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:55,963
- Hey. It's all set.
- I'm too fargone

275
00:23:57,807 --> 00:24:00,844
To turn around

276
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:05,523
I'll bet you a thousand dollars
we could pull it off.

277
00:24:05,607 --> 00:24:09,316
- Eddy, come on. Enough with this.
- Enough? Enough?

278
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,762
You say "enough" real quick,
don't you? Are you--

279
00:24:11,847 --> 00:24:15,522
Wait, wait, are you sure?
Let me tell you something.

280
00:24:15,607 --> 00:24:18,804
I can't remember when I've liked a guy
as much as I like you,
but the truth ofthe matter is...

281
00:24:18,887 --> 00:24:23,756
you're a wimp. You thinkyou can
be alive without taking risks.

282
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:25,166
- There's a lot ofdifferent ways--
- No, that-- You do.

283
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:27,124
That's why you end up living
this 50% existence...

284
00:24:27,207 --> 00:24:31,120
when there's 1 00% waiting
out there to be had.

285
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:34,005
You're full offear.
Your life is choked.

286
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:36,601
You-You writejingles when
you'd rather be doing albums.

287
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:38,882
You do it for money,
but you're always in debt.

288
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:43,757
You wanna make love to my wife,
but you're afraid you'll get caught.

289
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:46,759
This is how you die,
step by step...

290
00:24:46,847 --> 00:24:49,759
these little things
you deny yourself...

291
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:52,566
this cowardice.

292
00:24:52,647 --> 00:24:55,002
- It's not that.
- No, that is what it is. Who care--

293
00:24:55,087 --> 00:24:58,079
Who cares ifwe get caught?
Big deal.

294
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:03,562
Aw, forget it. You've lost yourjuice.
It's no big deal. It's your life.

295
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:07,879
Make a fiîst.
Too tight?

296
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:11,243
You really amaze me Richard,
you know.Just when things start
getting interesting around here...

297
00:25:11,327 --> 00:25:14,842
you go cautious on me, climb
back into your little shell.

298
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:18,363
And what about Priscilla? Hasn't she
told you how much more alive she feels?

299
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:22,156
Eddy, goddam it.
That's enough, okay?

300
00:25:22,247 --> 00:25:25,683
The subject is closed.
It's not gonna happen.

301
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:28,327
I hope we can stay friends.

302
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:33,276
I don't know. You make me feel bad.
You're sojudgmental.

303
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:36,404
I'm notjudgmental.
We'rejust different, okay?

304
00:25:36,487 --> 00:25:38,478
- You're you and I'm me.
- Oh, that is absolutely right!

305
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:41,877
I got balls and you don't. I'm a giver
and you're a taker. That's clear.

306
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:44,879
Well, in this particular case, it's a hell of
a lot easier foryou to give than for me, pal.

307
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:48,323
I happen to sleep
with my wife.

308
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:55,125
Boy, when you stick it in--

309
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:07,846
Fun, fun in thesun

310
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:19,357
Fun in thesun

311
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:21,836
Fun in thesun

312
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:23,838
Fun in thesun

313
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:31,798
- Sounds good.
- Fun, fun in thesun

314
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,680
Fun in thesun

315
00:26:54,887 --> 00:26:57,276
When you deem me worthy...

316
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:00,837
I'd like to know what happened
between you and Eddy.

317
00:27:49,287 --> 00:27:51,437
Oh. I got it.

318
00:27:53,127 --> 00:27:56,437
All right, uh, a little
to the left, I think.

319
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:59,803
Yeah. Perfect!

320
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:04,996
Is that a beautiful tree
or is that a beautiful tree?

321
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:10,155
- Think this tree is big enough?
- It's huge.

322
00:28:10,247 --> 00:28:12,477
- What are we gonna sing?
- It's beautiful.

323
00:28:13,887 --> 00:28:17,846
Dashing through thesnow
in a one-horse open sleigh

324
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:21,681
O'erthe fields wego

00:28:36,607 --> 00:28:39,997
- Is it about Kay?

331
00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:44,956
- Oh, what fun it is to ride

- Did you sleep with her?

332
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:47,117
No.

333
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:52,764
Priscilla, please.

334
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:56,681
Don't bejealous.
There's nothing to bejealous of.

335
00:28:57,607 --> 00:29:00,917
I'm notjealous.

338
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:11,445
To save usall
from Satan'spower

339
00:29:11,527 --> 00:29:13,643
Something went missing
from this marriage...

340
00:29:13,727 --> 00:29:18,084
- Oh, tidings ofcomfort andjoy
Comfort andjoy
- and for a while it...

341
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:23,002
- Oh, tidings ofcomfort andjoy

342
00:29:23,087 --> 00:29:27,080

- We should never have taken that money?
- Oh, tidings ofcomfort andjoy

348
00:29:44,007 --> 00:29:48,603
Now you say something? Now you're
gonna make your moral judgement.

349
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:52,475
-It's cold tonight, don't you think?
-Is that what this is all about?

350
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:58,802
Eddy lacks your moral fiîbre?
What about gratitude, Richard?

351
00:29:58,887 --> 00:30:01,003
- On the first dayofChristmas
mytrue love gave to me
- He risked his reputation.

352

- Swing. Whoa!
- Oh!

390
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:03,399
Come on, Richard. I know I'm--
I'm a tough act to follow.

391
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:04,920
It's the bat.
It must be the bat.

392
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,486
- It's all right.
- It's the bat.

393
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:08,478
- It's the bat.
- Go, go, go!

394
00:32:11,207 --> 00:32:13,846
- Get her!
- No!

395
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,439
No!

396
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,281
- No!
- Hey, look at them.

397
00:32:32,647 --> 00:32:35,878
I would like
to propose a toast.

398
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:40,802
To neighbours...

399
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:44,646
and friends.

400
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:34,280
Heaven

401
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:37,837

The happinesslseek

406
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:05,799
- You okay?
- Fine.

407
00:39:26,807 --> 00:39:29,275
There's coffee.

408
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:35,317
Priscilla--

409
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:39,596
The sports.

410
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,876
I love you.

411
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:57,277
I love you.

412
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:22,245
You kids get out ofthe street.

413
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:33,366
- What happened?
- You can't go in.

414
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:36,405
- I'm their best friend.
- You can't go in! Hey!

415
00:40:42,727 --> 00:40:44,843
You! You.

416
00:40:48,047 --> 00:40:52,723
Samples taken from the victim's
body prove you had sex with her
within a half-hour of her death.

417
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:56,038
Otis claims you had a "obsessive
fiîxation" on his wife.

418
00:40:56,127 --> 00:40:59,517
And the murder weapon
has your prints on it.

419
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:02,405
- We played softball that afternoon.
- Yes.

420
00:41:02,487 --> 00:41:05,843
Meanwhile, Otis says that your story
about crossing back and forth...

421
00:41:05,927 --> 00:41:08,487
during the night, etcetera,
is nonsense.

422
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:11,559
And says that immediately
after dinner, around 9.00 p.m....

423
00:41:11,647 --> 00:41:14,764
he departed for Appalachia Lake,
leaving his wife behind.

424
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,919
Now that's a fiîve-hour trip. Luke Watkins
ofWatkins Fishing Lodge...

425
00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:21,158
says Otis woke him
at 2.00 a.m. for the keys.

426
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:24,876
- It's a lie.
- Now the time ofdeath has been
set between 1 .00 and 3.00 a.m.

427
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:28,084
Now if Otis's story is true, the closest
he could have been to his wife...

428
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:32,080
at the time she was killed was
somewhere in the middle ofthe
Chattahoochee National Forest.

429
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:34,476
I'm telling you, it's a lie.

430
00:41:34,567 --> 00:41:36,876
If I were you, I'd consider
some kind of plea.

431
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:39,800
Otherwise, unless
we can break Eddy's alibi...

432
00:41:39,887 --> 00:41:42,003
you could be in deep, deep shit.

433
00:41:42,087 --> 00:41:44,726
Kneel down.

434
00:41:48,127 --> 00:41:51,199
Hands behind your head, please.

435
00:41:57,127 --> 00:41:59,038
Okay.

436
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:27,916
Are they treating you okay?

437
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:32,319
Don't worry about me.
How's Lori?

438
00:42:36,967 --> 00:42:39,527
What do I tell her?

439
00:42:40,887 --> 00:42:43,765
Tell her the truth.

440
00:42:43,847 --> 00:42:46,486
Tell her the truth.

441
00:42:49,647 --> 00:42:51,842
This is a nightmare.

442
00:42:53,327 --> 00:42:56,842
You have to help me understand this,
Richard. Please, help me.

443
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:59,043
Please.

444
00:42:59,127 --> 00:43:01,277
I thought it was
what everyone wanted.

445
00:43:01,367 --> 00:43:05,406
It seems like everyone was
pushing me to do it, even you.

446
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:12,486
Who was pushing you
to kill her?

447
00:43:15,687 --> 00:43:17,996
Are you insane?

448
00:43:18,087 --> 00:43:20,078
Priscilla, I didn't kill her.

449
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:21,998
Richard, you just said you--

450
00:43:22,087 --> 00:43:24,840
Mrs Parker, to the best
ofyour knowledge...

451
00:43:24,927 --> 00:43:27,282
did any other person
other than your husband...

452
00:43:27,367 --> 00:43:29,642
enteryour room
the night ofthe murder?

453
00:43:29,727 --> 00:43:33,402
No. No, ofcourse not.

454
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:37,082
That was your story, Richard?

455
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:39,806
I thought that was something
the papers made up.

456
00:43:39,887 --> 00:43:45,166
You please, you please think
ofsome other defence, please!

457
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:48,557
How could this have happened? How could
you have done this to Lori, Richard?

458
00:43:48,647 --> 00:43:52,037
How could you have done this
to our- our family?

459
00:43:52,127 --> 00:43:56,166
Richard! Oh, God!

460
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:17,043
Everyone told me
not to come here today...

461
00:44:17,127 --> 00:44:19,595
but I couldn't let
anyone else do this for me.

462
00:44:20,887 --> 00:44:24,562
I suppose I never was
as strong as I pretended.

463
00:44:24,647 --> 00:44:27,480
And I don't have the strength...

464
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:30,559
to be both the good wife...

465
00:44:30,647 --> 00:44:32,922
and the good mother.

466
00:44:33,007 --> 00:44:37,523
So I'm going to be
the good mother.

467
00:44:37,607 --> 00:44:41,441
I want to take Lori
away from all ofthis.

468
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,761
I want my name back.

469
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:51,761
I want a divorce.

470
00:44:53,927 --> 00:44:56,805
Lori is in hell, Richard.

471
00:44:57,807 --> 00:45:00,924
And I can't save you both.

472
00:45:15,047 --> 00:45:18,323
What this does is defiîne
the fiînancial terms ofthe divorce...

473
00:45:18,407 --> 00:45:21,160
to the satisfaction
ofthe bondsman.

474
00:45:21,247 --> 00:45:23,602
Along with your car
and musical instruments...

475
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:27,282
this pays my initial fee
and secures the bond.

476
00:45:27,367 --> 00:45:31,440
She's being very generous,
acting so fast.

477
00:45:33,487 --> 00:45:37,878
Well, you have 24 hours to remove
whatever personal effects you want
from the house.

478
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:40,242
The rest will be sold at auction
to pay foryour defence.

479
00:45:40,327 --> 00:45:43,603
And don't get into any trouble.

480
00:46:31,207 --> 00:46:33,880
Oh,Jesus.

481
00:46:33,967 --> 00:46:36,879
Who the hell are you?

482
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:40,482
My name is David Duttonville.

483
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:43,365
I'm a private investigator.

484
00:46:44,647 --> 00:46:46,524
I, um--

485
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:51,205
I'm gonna sit down now.

486
00:46:52,807 --> 00:46:55,401
You scared me.

487
00:46:57,247 --> 00:47:00,557
Door was open. I used to live
next door, I wasjust--

488
00:47:00,647 --> 00:47:03,286
Yes, I know who you are.

489
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:05,801
I thought you were
still in the, uh--

490
00:47:05,887 --> 00:47:08,481
- I made bail.
- Great.

491
00:47:12,327 --> 00:47:15,524
My company,
Duttonville Research--

492
00:47:15,607 --> 00:47:17,677
it's been hired
by three insurance companies...

493
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:21,646
to investigate a total
$1 .5 million double indemnity claim...

494
00:47:21,727 --> 00:47:24,480
by Eddy Otis
on his wife, Kay Otis.

495
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:29,079
In fact, we were hopin' that
you might be able to help us.

496
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:31,761
$1 .5 million?

497
00:47:31,847 --> 00:47:36,125
Yes. That's the point.

498
00:47:36,207 --> 00:47:39,517
It is rather a lot to take out
on a would-be lounge singer...

499
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:43,282
who never earned a cent
in her entire life.

500
00:47:43,367 --> 00:47:45,517
However, there's
no law against it.

501
00:47:45,607 --> 00:47:48,917
She had a policy on him
in the same amount.

502
00:47:50,847 --> 00:47:52,917
Eddy's explanation is...

503
00:47:53,007 --> 00:47:55,646
that they loved
each other so much...

504
00:47:55,727 --> 00:47:58,195
he fiîgured if
either ofthem got killed...

505
00:47:58,287 --> 00:48:01,120
they'd need
a lot ofcompensation.

506
00:48:02,407 --> 00:48:05,205
It's a funny attitude.

507
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:09,284
The world is a funny place.

508
00:48:12,207 --> 00:48:14,801
So he went back in there...

509
00:48:14,887 --> 00:48:17,845
and he beat her to death...

510
00:48:17,927 --> 00:48:19,963
for money.

511
00:48:21,487 --> 00:48:24,479
Just as simple as that.

512
00:48:26,127 --> 00:48:28,641
Isn't that amazing?

513
00:48:29,927 --> 00:48:32,236
I even think he liked her.

514
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:36,525
You're saying
he killed Kay Otis?

515
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:39,075
Ofcourse he killed her.

516
00:48:40,727 --> 00:48:43,195
But what a set-up.

517
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:48,640
The whole thing
just so he could--

518
00:48:52,647 --> 00:48:55,286
$1 .5 million.

519
00:48:56,447 --> 00:49:00,122
I checked his alibi.
It's gonna hold.

520
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:06,326
What about the people at the lodge?
I wonder how much he paid them.

521
00:49:06,407 --> 00:49:08,363
Me too.

522
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:13,157
But who is Eddy?
Where'd he come from?

523
00:49:13,247 --> 00:49:17,035
I was hoping you knew.

524
00:49:17,127 --> 00:49:20,164
He told me he was
a fiînancial advisor.

525
00:49:20,247 --> 00:49:22,317
Great.

526
00:49:22,407 --> 00:49:24,637
Now I know.

527
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,641
I'm on this for a week.

528
00:49:29,727 --> 00:49:33,925
There's a limit to what
one can do in a week.

529
00:49:35,447 --> 00:49:38,120
I need something solid.

530
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:41,199
You got anything?

531
00:49:41,287 --> 00:49:44,882
Just what I already
told them.

532
00:49:44,967 --> 00:49:46,366
The police know about
the insurance, I suppose?

533
00:49:46,447 --> 00:49:52,238
They're not interested. I think
they feel comfortable with you.

534
00:49:52,327 --> 00:49:56,002
- Comfortable?
- You know what I mean.

535
00:49:56,087 --> 00:49:58,681
They got a good case.

536
00:49:58,767 --> 00:50:01,361
Look, you got my card.

537
00:50:01,447 --> 00:50:04,041
You think ofanything,
you give me a call.

538
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:06,687
Oh, and by the way,
in case you're interested...

539
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:10,806
when I interviewed Otis,
he was with your spouse.

540
00:50:10,887 --> 00:50:15,039
The grieving widower
comforting the lonely wife.

541
00:50:16,007 --> 00:50:18,077
I'm gonna get going.

542
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:20,317
Goodbye.

543
00:50:52,327 --> 00:50:55,797
I'm Richard Parker.
Why are you doing this to me?

544
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:59,436
- Who is it?
- Call the police.

545
00:50:59,527 --> 00:51:02,200
Get my gun,
then call the police.

546
00:51:02,287 --> 00:51:04,755
I've lost my wife...

547
00:51:04,847 --> 00:51:08,237
my child, my home.

548
00:51:10,247 --> 00:51:14,035
I'm facing a death sentence
or life imprisonment.

549
00:51:14,127 --> 00:51:16,004
Call the police.

550
00:51:16,087 --> 00:51:19,363
How do you sleep at night?

551
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,239
Damn it, woman,
call the police.

552
00:51:25,887 --> 00:51:29,482
Didn't he pay you
enough to kill me?

553
00:51:47,927 --> 00:51:50,316
Richard, uh,
this is George Gordon.

554
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:54,559
I'm afraid we failedingetting
a furtherpostponement ofthe trial.

555
00:51:54,647 --> 00:51:56,365
The trial willbe
in three weeks.

556
00:51:56,447 --> 00:52:00,486
Ido have to sayl wouldadvise
you to reconsideryourplea.

557
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:02,398
Thankyou.

558
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:22,242
Allmy life
I've been a slave

559
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:29,444
Justput me down
andlet me be

560
00:52:32,087 --> 00:52:35,762
Free from all

561
00:52:35,847 --> 00:52:41,763
Thismisery

562
00:52:43,847 --> 00:52:47,362
Mmm, that was Olivia Kamen with
'Put No Headstone On My Grave... "

563
00:52:47,447 --> 00:52:50,086
a songmade famous
byLittle EstherPhillips...

564
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,637
at The Blues Connection here
in Five Points, Atlanta. Next--

565
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,638
There you go.

566
00:53:49,687 --> 00:53:51,837
Kay?

567
00:53:56,687 --> 00:53:59,645
Sorry.

568
00:53:59,727 --> 00:54:01,763
What happened
to the contest?

569
00:54:01,847 --> 00:54:03,883
Contest?

570
00:54:03,967 --> 00:54:07,039
There was a blues contest
on the radio.

571
00:54:07,127 --> 00:54:10,085
- I wasjust listening to it.
- Oh, that was last week.

572
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:12,362
You must have been
listening to a repeat.

573
00:54:14,767 --> 00:54:18,806
There was a singer,
Olivia Kamen?

574
00:54:18,887 --> 00:54:21,447
Oh, she won. But when we
went out lookin' for her...

575
00:54:21,527 --> 00:54:25,122
to give her the prize, she lit out.
Didn't leave an address or nothin'.

576
00:54:28,087 --> 00:54:30,726
- What does she look like?
- What does she look like?

577
00:54:30,807 --> 00:54:33,116
Ooh, she looked good!

578
00:55:13,807 --> 00:55:15,684
- All right!
- Yeah!

579
00:55:15,767 --> 00:55:17,598
Thankyou.
Thankyou very much.

580
00:55:17,687 --> 00:55:21,202
And thanks to our friend that
we haven't seen in a long time.

581
00:55:21,287 --> 00:55:23,847
- Tip your bartenders and waitresses.
- They're not bad.

582
00:55:23,927 --> 00:55:27,044
And remember, we love you.
We thankyou for loving the music.

583
00:55:27,127 --> 00:55:31,040
Drive safe on your way home.
Good night.

584
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:36,804
- Who lovesyouso, mm-hmm
- That's her voice.

585
00:55:36,887 --> 00:55:39,117
I'd know it ifshe was
singing underwater.

586
00:55:39,207 --> 00:55:41,243
So who got killed
that night?

587
00:55:41,327 --> 00:55:43,443
I don't know.

588
00:55:43,527 --> 00:55:46,519
We gotta exhume the body
and get a closer look.

589
00:55:46,607 --> 00:55:50,077
Can't exhume the body. It was cremated.
I checked on the way over.

590
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:54,797
Besides, Otis is not the only
one who identifiîed the body.

591
00:55:54,887 --> 00:55:59,677
- Someone else?
- A doctor.

592
00:55:59,767 --> 00:56:03,680
- A doctor?
- Yeah.

593
00:56:03,767 --> 00:56:07,043
I'll bet you $1 ,000 ifyou
call my insurance company...

594
00:56:07,127 --> 00:56:10,005
you will see that same doctor's
name on an insurance claim...

595
00:56:10,087 --> 00:56:14,080
that Eddy made when he faked
an accident involving my car.

596
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:17,443
You're suggesting that Otis...

597
00:56:17,527 --> 00:56:21,361
- went out and hired someone...
- Probably.

598
00:56:21,447 --> 00:56:25,440
who resembled Kay, so you
could make love to her...

599
00:56:25,527 --> 00:56:30,442
- and he could then beat her to death.
- Yes.

600
00:56:32,647 --> 00:56:35,320
I'll think about it.

601
00:56:35,407 --> 00:56:41,084
From allthe trouble
you've causedme

602
00:56:41,167 --> 00:56:43,044
Okay, okay,
she's got a nice voice.

603
00:56:43,127 --> 00:56:45,925
- Turn it off before I break down and cry.
- Don't--

604
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:49,204
- Do you have any other recordings?
- Like what?

605
00:56:49,287 --> 00:56:52,438
Recordings like she made
before she died.

606
00:56:52,527 --> 00:56:55,280
I told you, she didn't record
anything. That's my point.

607
00:56:55,367 --> 00:57:00,077
No, that's my point.
We have no comparison.

608
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:02,397
A broad in some club in
Five Points sounds like...

609
00:57:02,487 --> 00:57:04,921
some broad who got
snuffed in Huntcliffe...

610
00:57:05,007 --> 00:57:08,397
according to you,
the accused snuffer.

611
00:57:08,487 --> 00:57:12,002
I go into court with a thing like that,
they'll laugh in my face.

612
00:57:12,087 --> 00:57:15,045
And the initials KO,
OK, Olivia Kamen--

613
00:57:15,127 --> 00:57:19,120
Oh, please, please,
Mr Parker, I'm an old man.

614
00:57:19,207 --> 00:57:21,516
Does it fall to me at this time
of life to have to explain...

615
00:57:21,607 --> 00:57:25,759
the fundamental principles ofthejudicial
system to a man ofyour intelligence?

616
00:57:25,847 --> 00:57:29,681
Evidence, dear boy.
Evidence.

617
00:57:29,767 --> 00:57:33,646
So fiînd it, you old bastard.
Find it.

618
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:37,601
Help me up.

619
00:57:40,766 --> 00:57:42,722
- Hi, Dad. Bye, Dad.
- Say, don't slam the door.

620
00:57:42,806 --> 00:57:47,880
- No fiîghting.Junior, I mean it.
- Mama.

621
00:57:47,966 --> 00:57:52,039
- You called me.
- Yeah. I thought you'd call me back.

622
00:57:52,126 --> 00:57:54,594
I-l normally don't do
business here at my home.

623
00:57:54,686 --> 00:57:57,644
- What'd you fiînd out?
- Daddy's coming now.
I know he promised.

624
00:57:57,726 --> 00:58:01,719
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Ready or not, here I come.

625
00:58:01,806 --> 00:58:04,684
- No, no, no, no, you can't. You cheated.
- There's not a trace so far.

626
00:58:04,766 --> 00:58:08,042
But there was a woman disappeared that
night, similar appearance and everything.

627
00:58:08,126 --> 00:58:10,765
Hi, honey. Uh, the boys
are waiting foryou to play basketball.

628
00:58:10,846 --> 00:58:15,397
Oh, this is, uh, Richard Parker,
that insurance case--

629
00:58:15,486 --> 00:58:19,399
- Hello, Richard. Mm-hmm.
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

630
00:58:19,486 --> 00:58:22,444
- Uh, we'll be fiînished here in a minute.
- I'm gonna start dinner.

631
00:58:22,526 --> 00:58:24,357
Sorry to intrude.

632
00:58:25,846 --> 00:58:29,077
But I did fiînd the doctor who
signed that death certifiîcate.

633
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:31,396
Name's, uh, Dr Pettering.

634
00:58:31,486 --> 00:58:34,239
He also signed Eddy's injury claim.

635
00:58:34,326 --> 00:58:37,796
Seems he was a promising
young doctor in Chicago...

636
00:58:37,886 --> 00:58:40,354
till he got greedy
and blew himself up.

637
00:58:40,446 --> 00:58:42,676
He's got a scar down
one side of his face.

638
00:58:42,766 --> 00:58:46,520
Yeah, otherwise
he's real good-lookin'.

639
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,836
A month after the murder...

640
00:58:48,926 --> 00:58:51,394
he and Eddy went
into partnership.

641
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:55,559
They call it a residential treatment centre
for addictive disorders.

642
00:58:59,046 --> 00:59:02,038
There is a third partner.

643
00:59:02,126 --> 00:59:04,242
A third partner.

644
00:59:04,326 --> 00:59:08,239
Partner in both senses ofthe word.
Do you catch my drift?

645
00:59:10,806 --> 00:59:13,764
Your wife.

646
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:15,882
Priscilla.

647
00:59:19,686 --> 00:59:24,043
If Eddy catches you
prowling around his property...

648
00:59:24,126 --> 00:59:28,199
he will have
your bail revoked.

649
00:59:28,286 --> 00:59:31,084
He's got my wife and child.

650
00:59:33,886 --> 00:59:36,354
Do you think-- Do any ofyou feel
qualifiîed to deal with him...

651
00:59:36,446 --> 00:59:38,914
or do we actually bring somebody
else in? ls that a possibility?

652
00:59:39,006 --> 00:59:41,964
Or is it pretty much
a moot point?

653
01:01:16,126 --> 01:01:18,196
- Hello.
- Igotyourmessage.

654
01:01:18,286 --> 01:01:19,924
Didn 't ltellyou not togo
to Charleston, Richard?

655
01:01:20,006 --> 01:01:25,034
Why didn't he kill the real Kay?
It would have been a lot easier.

656
01:01:25,126 --> 01:01:27,924
Maybe they werepartners in it.
Maybe he likedhertoo much.

657
01:01:28,006 --> 01:01:32,955
- But ldon't--
- Maybe they're still in touch.

658
01:01:33,046 --> 01:01:38,245
- It'sapossibility, lguess.
- It's my last possibility.

659
01:01:42,406 --> 01:01:44,920
- Hey, Sam, how are ya?
- Oh, I'm just fiîne.

660
01:01:56,326 --> 01:01:58,715
Honey, don't squeeze
the bread like that.

661
01:02:10,726 --> 01:02:12,717
These are so special.

662
01:02:12,806 --> 01:02:16,958
Mom, please,
I really want that.

663
01:02:38,566 --> 01:02:40,477
- Hello. Hi, Eddy.
- Priscilla, hi.

664
01:02:40,566 --> 01:02:42,875
- Didyouget thesamples?
- Yeah, I got them. I'm on my way.

665
01:02:42,966 --> 01:02:46,242
- Want togo out to dinnertonight?
- No, I think we should stay in.

666
01:02:46,326 --> 01:02:49,045
Lori goes back in a few days and, uh,
she seems a bit upset lately.

667
01:02:49,126 --> 01:02:52,721
So it'd be great ifwe could, uh, you know,
spend the night in the house.

668
01:02:52,806 --> 01:02:54,876
- All right. I'll see you in a little while.
- Loveyou.

669
01:02:54,966 --> 01:02:56,797
Okay. Bye-bye.

670
01:03:01,046 --> 01:03:04,322
Rape!
Richard! Go away!

671
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:06,237
- Leave me alone, please!
- Priscilla!

672
01:03:06,326 --> 01:03:08,476
- No!
- Listen to me!

673
01:03:08,566 --> 01:03:12,161
Don't--
Don't hurt me, please!

674
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:14,885
I'm not gonna hurt you.

675
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:22,079
- I--
- I want you to play this for Eddy.

676
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:27,038
It's Kay. She's alive.

677
01:03:30,566 --> 01:03:32,477
It was another one
of Eddy's scams.

678
01:03:32,566 --> 01:03:35,364
This one was for
a million and a half.

679
01:03:35,446 --> 01:03:39,280
Oh, Richard. Oh.

680
01:03:39,366 --> 01:03:43,279
Just play the tape...

681
01:03:43,366 --> 01:03:47,041
for Eddy tonight.

682
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:52,723
- May I go now?
- You'll play it?

683
01:03:52,806 --> 01:03:54,876
I'll play the tape.

684
01:04:05,246 --> 01:04:07,202
How's Lori?

685
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,677
Can I see her?

686
01:04:11,766 --> 01:04:15,998
Please? Please!
Priscilla?

687
01:04:21,326 --> 01:04:24,443
Where are you staying?

688
01:04:24,526 --> 01:04:27,040
The Carolina Motel.

689
01:04:27,126 --> 01:04:29,845
For how long?

690
01:04:29,926 --> 01:04:31,996
That depends.

691
01:04:36,326 --> 01:04:38,396
Be careful.

692
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:48,484
Don'tput no headstone
on mygrave

693
01:04:50,006 --> 01:04:55,717
Allmy life
I've been a slave

694

On mygrave

700
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:55,043
Allmy life

Justput me down

702

Thismisery

704
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:24,955
I'm sorry.

705
01:06:28,966 --> 01:06:31,526
That sounded
so much like Kay.

706
01:06:35,126 --> 01:06:37,799
It really got to me.

707
01:06:40,366 --> 01:06:44,325
Where did you fiînd that?

708
01:06:44,406 --> 01:06:47,478
I got it in the mail.

709
01:06:53,806 --> 01:06:57,196
It's from Richard.

710
01:06:57,286 --> 01:07:00,403
I got it in the mail.

711
01:07:00,486 --> 01:07:03,523
Oh, that poor, sick bastard.

712
01:07:06,646 --> 01:07:09,365
What's he trying
to do to us?

713
01:07:11,126 --> 01:07:12,957
He fiînds some girl
that sounds like Kay.

714
01:07:13,046 --> 01:07:15,514
He records it
and sends it here.

715
01:07:16,806 --> 01:07:20,242
You thinkyou've
started a life...

716
01:07:20,326 --> 01:07:24,444
and you hear something like this
and itjust brings it all back!

717
01:07:29,326 --> 01:07:31,362
I'm sorry.

718
01:08:39,686 --> 01:08:43,520
- You got anything?
- Got, uh, three Memphis.

719
01:08:43,606 --> 01:08:47,838
- I got a Memphis. Savannahs.
- Savannah here.

720
01:08:47,926 --> 01:08:52,317
- Atlantic City, New York, Chicago.
- Another Savannah.

721
01:08:52,406 --> 01:08:56,479
Savannah, Savannah, Savannah.
Four Savannahs.

722
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:59,524
The same day that Eddy
heard the tape. Same number.

723
01:08:59,606 --> 01:09:04,805
- Great, let's give it a call.
- 91 2-555-3722.

724
01:09:07,086 --> 01:09:09,441
- Here, give it a try.
- No, you do it, you do it.

725
01:09:09,526 --> 01:09:11,517
-Just ask for Olivia Kamen.
- Scoville Hotel.

726
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:14,404
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello. Scoville Hotel.

727
01:09:14,486 --> 01:09:17,159

- Yeah. Scoville Hotel.

728
01:09:17,246 --> 01:09:20,795
Uh, can you give me
Olivia Kamen's room?

729
01:09:20,886 --> 01:09:25,198
- Who?
- That's K-a-m-e-n.

730
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:28,323
One moment.

731
01:09:34,566 --> 01:09:37,763
- What?
- They're ringing her room.

732
01:09:39,726 --> 01:09:42,638
She's there.

733
01:10:17,686 --> 01:10:21,679
- What can I do foryou?
- I'm looking for an Olivia Kamen.

734
01:10:21,766 --> 01:10:25,202
- She's down at the Dominion Cafe.
- Where's that?

735
01:10:25,286 --> 01:10:29,040
It's a joint on
East Broad and Bay.

736
01:10:29,126 --> 01:10:32,801
- Could you walk it from here?
- No, but you could.

737
01:10:52,606 --> 01:10:58,238
Once mycup
was overflowing

738
01:11:01,046 --> 01:11:05,756

What a lesson
llearned

742
01:11:26,086 --> 01:11:29,920
Lookingback

743
01:11:30,006 --> 01:11:32,645
Overmy deeds

744
01:11:34,526 --> 01:11:37,996

751
01:12:07,806 --> 01:12:12,084

I'llnever

753
01:12:19,286 --> 01:12:22,323
Mistake again

754
01:12:31,846 --> 01:12:33,757
You can't go in there.

755
01:12:35,806 --> 01:12:39,924
Where is she?
Olivia Kamen? Where is she?

756
01:12:40,006 --> 01:12:44,158
- She's gone.
- Olivia Kamen. Which room?

757
01:12:48,966 --> 01:12:52,322
All the way to the top
on the roof.

758
01:14:03,886 --> 01:14:07,117
- I didn't know! I swear--
- Don't lie to me!

759
01:14:09,206 --> 01:14:13,404
I swear. That night
after we played baseball...

760
01:14:13,486 --> 01:14:16,080
he told me to go up to the lake
to Watkins Lodge...

761
01:14:16,166 --> 01:14:19,124
and stay out ofsight.

762
01:14:19,206 --> 01:14:22,562
You drove the Mercedes
with the cigarette boat.

763
01:14:22,646 --> 01:14:27,925
The next morning,
he shows up on his motorbike.

764
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:30,804
We go out on the lake...

765
01:14:30,886 --> 01:14:34,595
and he tells me everything.

766
01:14:35,966 --> 01:14:39,322
And then he said
if I told anyone...

767
01:14:39,406 --> 01:14:42,398
he'd say I'd known all along.

768
01:14:44,686 --> 01:14:50,238
Then I went to Canada,
and I tried to forget...

769
01:14:53,046 --> 01:14:55,640
what I did to you.

770
01:15:18,086 --> 01:15:20,156
Yes?

771
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:26,077
There's a David Duttonville
downstairs.

772
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:29,442
He-- He wants
to see you alone.

773
01:17:23,926 --> 01:17:26,076
- Hi.
- Hi.

774
01:17:29,086 --> 01:17:32,556
How was Atlanta?

775
01:17:32,646 --> 01:17:34,876
I missed you.

776
01:17:39,046 --> 01:17:43,324
Looks like somebody in your
family's been travelling.

777
01:17:43,406 --> 01:17:48,355
One, two, three,
four shirts, one suit.

778
01:17:48,446 --> 01:17:50,562
Tuesday?

779
01:19:15,046 --> 01:19:17,560
And you're sure
it was Richard?

780
01:19:17,646 --> 01:19:20,877
The deskman said he saw him
go upstairs with Miss Kamen.

781
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:23,275
There were fiîngerprints
all over the place.

782
01:19:23,366 --> 01:19:26,881
The Savannah police think that by now
there's a good chance
he may have left Savannah.

783
01:19:26,966 --> 01:19:29,764
- Do you want us to put
some men up by the house?
- No, I have a 24-hour guard.

784
01:19:29,846 --> 01:19:33,759
- We have very tight security.
- Do you mind ifwejust
check around your property...

785
01:19:33,846 --> 01:19:36,599
- to make sure you're adequately
protected?
- No, I'd appreciate that.

786
01:20:08,806 --> 01:20:11,195
- Eddy? Before you come up...
- Yeah?

787
01:20:11,286 --> 01:20:14,995
will you grab my purse, please?
It's next to the telephone.

788
01:20:15,086 --> 01:20:17,725
Sure.

789
01:20:33,046 --> 01:20:35,037
Thankyou.

790
01:20:37,686 --> 01:20:40,075
Hello?

791
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:42,077
Yes, it is.

792
01:20:43,726 --> 01:20:45,603
What? Now?

793
01:20:47,246 --> 01:20:50,636
Well, it's a little--

794
01:20:50,726 --> 01:20:53,843
All right, tell him
I'll be over.

795
01:20:53,926 --> 01:20:56,315
Yeah, fiîve minutes.
Yeah, okay.

796
01:20:59,406 --> 01:21:01,920
The police are over at the clinic.
They want me to come by.

797
01:21:03,966 --> 01:21:06,082
How are you?

798
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:08,726
Fine.

799
01:21:08,806 --> 01:21:11,798
You've been through
a lot today.

800
01:21:11,886 --> 01:21:15,003
Don't worry.
I won't be long.

801
01:21:15,086 --> 01:21:17,281
I'm not gonna leave you.

802
01:21:26,246 --> 01:21:28,476
Oh, God.

803
01:25:51,966 --> 01:25:57,120
Did you know that I can
see things, Priscilla?

804
01:25:57,206 --> 01:25:59,845
I can see things nobody can.

805
01:26:04,806 --> 01:26:07,001
I'm so good...

806
01:26:07,086 --> 01:26:10,317
at predicting...

807
01:26:10,406 --> 01:26:13,603
that I can read
tomorrow's headline.

808
01:26:16,086 --> 01:26:21,114
"A man last night broke into
the home of his ex-wife...

01:26:47,406 --> 01:26:50,876
Oh, yes, he's here.

816
01:26:50,966 --> 01:26:55,198
Priscilla, he's in the house
right now, wondering...

817
01:26:55,286 --> 01:26:59,438
when he should make
his fiînal move.

818
01:26:59,526 --> 01:27:01,915
Why?

819
01:27:02,006 --> 01:27:04,315
Because I wanted him to.

820
01:27:06,286 --> 01:27:09,801
He's my puppet.

821
01:27:12,286 --> 01:27:14,561
Here he comes.

822
01:27:16,006 --> 01:27:18,236
Come on, Richard.

823
01:27:22,326 --> 01:27:24,965
Come to papa.

824
01:30:39,486 --> 01:30:41,954
