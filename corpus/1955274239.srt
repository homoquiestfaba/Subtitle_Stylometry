This is an objective
Priority Level 4.

00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:38,242
- Put the team in Amber state.
- Yes sir. They are ready.

10
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:03,539
Get out!

11
00:03:10,747 --> 00:03:12,476
Talk Zeus, out.

12
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,719
The hostages got out of the boats.

13
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,081
Trigger unlocked.

14
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:29,766
Look  objective indicators.
It is not clear to fire, wait.

15
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:32,202
I repeat, it is not clear to shoot.

Copying, Zeus.
Speaks Rampage in scope.

17
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:38,975
Hello, Air Force. How's my
designated shooter Falcon team?

18
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:41,044
Do not you mean "Chair Force", sir?

19
00:03:41,144 --> 00:03:42,443
With all due respect...

20
00:03:42,543 --> 00:03:44,857
Have been out firing 2,000 rounds a week
...

21
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:47,975
During the last four months
prior to this deployment.

22
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:51,179
We are here to work,
like you idiots.

23
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:54,391
So why do not you ruin yourself
, Cervantes?

24
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:55,958
No, thank you, Chair Force.

25
00:03:56,326 --> 00:03:58,128
Falcon in position, Zeus.

26
00:03:58,228 --> 00:04:00,788
Burla the lookout.

27
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:02,927
<i>
Air Force thanks you for the ride together </i>.

00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,291
My pleasure.
Suicide, status report.

29
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:09,729
Suicide in position,
observed through his sights.

30
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:15,278
Behold a pale horse.
That's a fucking omen.

31
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:17,647
This looks like a real damn show.

32
00:04:17,747 --> 00:04:19,806
Pegasus  Wait outside.

33
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:06,922

Bandolero in sight.

35
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:15,604
String Bean.

36
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:25,078
The death of these Americans is the result of crimes
US.

37
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:27,145
Blood for blood.

38
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:29,480
The hostages are American, sir.

39
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:32,650
To arms, they are unarmed.

40
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:37,986
Zeus, this is the order. It is clear.

41
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:42,957
Talk Zeus, out. It is clear.
I repeat: It is clear.

42
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,229
Rampage, shoot after you.

43
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:52,241

00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:05,050
Young in the target group.

45
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:11,325
No way.

46
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:13,422
The boy will do first.

47
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:17,525
Rampage, kill the son of a bitch.

48
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,073
Rampage, Shoot now!

49
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:32,680
Shoot, man.

50
00:06:41,257 --> 00:06:43,760
I do not look.
I repeat, Falcon has the looks and looks.

51
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,555
Soliciting  precedent.

52
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:53,737
Rampage, Make the damn shot!

53
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:55,168
Raises the knife.

54
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,241
I said I wake up!

55
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:00,172
Do you understand, Rampage?

56
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:02,803
Shoot.

57
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:06,238
<i>Suicide, it's all yours </i>.

58
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:18,228
A dead hostage, sir.

00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:20,626
- Where is Pegasus?
- Two minutes.

60
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:29,571
Throw it.

61
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:36,729
Let's support them.

62
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:40,806
Identifying multiple objectives.
Aguardando turn.

63
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:53,722
Shoot.

64
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:13,101
- Tell me my distance.
- Thousand meters.

65
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:20,072
I lost.

66
00:09:47,644 --> 00:09:50,204
Preparing goal.
Armando missiles.

67
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:55,812
Objective  ready.

68
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,850
- Launch the missile.
- Copying.

69
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:03,424
Launched missile.

70
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:30,778
Objective  destroyed.

71
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:34,551
Bring them back.

72
00:10:58,748 --> 00:11:01,417
Pediatrician  Colorado Springs.

73
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:04,748
It provided care
villas that had not seen a doctor in a decade.

74
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:08,485
The helicopter is here.
May run down.

75
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:12,058
Gunny, I can talk to you?

76
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:19,301
You doubted.

77
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:21,760
You lost composure.

78
00:11:23,706 --> 00:11:24,826
You want to talk about it?

79
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,575
I'll give you the next time.

80
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:31,376
Our business has no "next time".

81
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:34,080
We only have once.

82
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:36,378
You have an opportunity to do well.

83
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,378
Do you understand?

84
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,584
Yes.

85
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:57,039
ISTANBUL, TURKEY

86
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:27,669
Come on!

87
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:31,933
Man.

88
00:12:35,745 --> 00:12:38,043
- Yes!
- It's okay.

89
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:46,478
- For Istanbul.
- Get out of the damn trash!

90
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,580
I thought Iraq was a garbage pit.

91
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,683
Syria. Afghanistan. It is the same
infernal pit crazy idiots...

92
00:12:52,783 --> 00:12:55,064
Who they believe that a good time is beheading.

93
00:12:55,164 --> 00:12:56,729
Hey. Can we avoid?

94
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,004
Hey, Red, can you tell contemplative
your boyfriend you relax?

95
00:13:01,104 --> 00:13:04,301
Ex-boyfriend.
Obsession that story ended.

96
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:09,868
Hey, do not take it with me,
underling, just because you failed.

97
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:20,723
You ruined the good vibe.
Did you have to do?

98
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:22,191
What?

99
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,860
Fuck you alone, Chair Force.

100
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,396
Do not we surround ourselves with rubbish,
to fight each other?

101
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:27,793
Fighting ons.

102
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:41,239
Do not let it get to you, brother.

103
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,214
I again call "subaltern"
and Rojas will be an observer.

104
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:52,178
Aungst is harmless, man. Ignore her.

105
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:57,850
What has been bothering you, brother?

106
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,091
However, she's right. Aungst.

107
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:07,570
I failed, when I put that damn
child in sight.

108
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,694
Yes.

109
00:14:09,372 --> 00:14:10,532
What?

110
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,609
And if I keep doing this,
I not want to do it halfway.

111
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:18,947
You agree that you made a mistake, man.

112
00:14:19,515 --> 00:14:21,107
I Am an infant.

113
00:14:23,753 --> 00:14:25,015
I'm fine.

114
00:14:25,788 --> 00:14:27,949
Are you sure?
I'll be around if you need me, brother.

115
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:31,360
Yeah, man, just give me a minute.

116
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:34,288
Sure.

117
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:24,896
You followed me from afar.

118
00:16:25,474 --> 00:16:27,203
Better than you do well and I
impressions.

119
00:16:28,678 --> 00:16:30,236
No pressure.

120
00:16:40,623 --> 00:16:42,682
So what brought you to Istanbul?

121
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:47,091
Really? So you start?

122
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:51,526
Sorry. It's just...

123
00:16:52,335 --> 00:16:55,031
It has been a long time since I've seen
a beautiful woman.

124
00:16:57,306 --> 00:16:58,306
Best.

125
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:04,375
By business. Your?

126
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,180
The same. Where do you live?

127
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,513
Far away from here.

128
00:17:16,392 --> 00:17:17,882
What about you?

129
00:17:18,227 --> 00:17:23,187
I'm not really sure. Here right now.
Next week, I do not know.

130
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,334
Military?

131
00:17:33,075 --> 00:17:34,277
Is that obvious?

132
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:37,437
You're not from the Navy, Navy
either or Air Force.

133
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,374
There remains one.

134
00:17:39,815 --> 00:17:40,907
Coast Guard?

135
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:57,597
Yes, that'll get
if that invite me to your hotel.

136
00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:34,730
Sorry.

137
00:18:39,842 --> 00:18:41,104
Hello, Gunny.

138
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:43,144
Bidwell?

139
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:46,749
In food cans,
south side of the bridge.

140
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:48,339
In twenty minutes.

141
00:19:15,144 --> 00:19:16,338
Crazy World, right?

142
00:19:18,114 --> 00:19:20,105
What are you doing here?

143
00:19:23,152 --> 00:19:25,521
You followed from Syria
a reward for killing you.

144
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:28,647
€ 150,000 by kill.

145
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:32,294
I called my office,
and came to solve.

146
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:33,396
What?

147
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:35,096
There is nothing else to do but be
.

148
00:19:37,233 --> 00:19:38,233
Syria.

149
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:42,103
A damn mad country, right?

150
00:19:43,472 --> 00:19:44,564
's All the same.

151
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:49,308
You had to ask, right?

152
00:19:50,446 --> 00:19:51,914
Miller informed me.

153
00:19:52,014 --> 00:19:55,074
I failed, man. I ruined the operation.

154
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:58,854
Miller would have lowered the range
me if it were not for my father.

155
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:00,182
What do you know about him?

156
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,819
Is gone as usual.

157
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:07,289
You're a valuable resource, Gunny,
if you need more time.

158
00:20:07,696 --> 00:20:08,890
I'm fine.

159
00:20:10,065 --> 00:20:11,692
You can not repeat what Syria.

160
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:14,635
She was just a child.

161
00:20:15,271 --> 00:20:18,001
Listen carefully what you say, Gunny.

162
00:20:18,374 --> 00:20:21,969
The work we do,
is not the work of God.

163
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:24,547
We do what he does not want to do.

164
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:28,584
There is no verse in the Bible
to help us sleep at night.

165
00:20:28,684 --> 00:20:30,743
Are we morally defensible?
Maybe not.

166
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,189
Are we necessary?
Of course, dammit!

167
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:38,994
That's the job.

168
00:20:39,094 --> 00:20:41,664
We must accept difficult jobs.

169
00:20:41,764 --> 00:20:44,790
No divine providence for what we do, does it?

170
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:47,802
I hesitated.

171
00:20:50,472 --> 00:20:53,532
You must turn off the emotional side of your head.

172
00:20:55,477 --> 00:20:58,180
You have a conscience.
That is not bad.

173
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,478
But do not let the
imperfection is a friend of the good.

174
00:21:04,987 --> 00:21:08,980
It is hard life after observing through the scope.

175
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,721
Aiming the target, life and death,
black and white.

176
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:19,026
Looking
Marines and members of the Navy, Gunny.

177
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:24,533
Back to work.

178
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:39,004
Major Bidwell, how was it?

179
00:22:39,415 --> 00:22:40,549
It was very easy.

180
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:42,084
Other drunks are.

181
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:44,353
Worked on that, sir,
when we asked for it.

182
00:22:44,453 --> 00:22:45,588
Where's Miller, sir?

183
00:22:45,688 --> 00:22:47,756
They were not the only team in the field.

184
00:22:47,856 --> 00:22:50,092
I assume you have not read their reports.

185
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:53,529
Just because we can count on you
to tell us what to do here.

186
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:56,325
The Navy wants you to protect the site.

187
00:22:56,532 --> 00:22:58,295
Trans-Georgian pipeline.

188
00:22:58,734 --> 00:23:01,503
Transport natural gas from Georgia...

189
00:23:01,603 --> 00:23:04,974
Through the Black Sea
to Eastern Europe and beyond.

190
00:23:05,074 --> 00:23:06,939
It's much territory to protect.

191
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:10,572
With all due respect, Colonel,
we are not civilian contractors.

192
00:23:10,813 --> 00:23:13,082
Quiet, Air Force.

193
00:23:13,182 --> 00:23:16,018
Marines will travel with as a courtesy.

194
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:18,814
- Understood?
- It is understood.

195
00:23:19,355 --> 00:23:20,947
Colonel, excuse me for making him wait.

196
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:23,188
No, I did wait for me.

197
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:27,757
So let's get to the point.

198
00:23:37,606 --> 00:23:39,208
I'm Robin Slater...

199
00:23:39,308 --> 00:23:41,970

Babayev will be the link with the Armed Forces of Georgia.

201
00:23:45,647 --> 00:23:47,876
When CFC has been asked to organize security...

202
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:49,852
Of-Georgian Gas Pipeline Trans...

203
00:23:49,952 --> 00:23:53,989
Which mostly
monitor the local military and law enforcement.

204
00:23:54,089 --> 00:23:59,094
Recent incidents in constructions require high-level response.

205
00:23:59,194 --> 00:24:03,265
In Georgia, just outside Tbilisi,
involve local insurgents...

206
00:24:03,365 --> 00:24:06,163
As well radical elements in Afghanistan and Iraq.

207
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:10,706
For this reason the CFC approved the request
to bring your team.

208
00:24:10,806 --> 00:24:12,708
What kind of incidents we talking about?

209
00:24:12,808 --> 00:24:16,211
Sniper attacks managerial staff and engineers.

210
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:20,008

Tbilisi, Georgia, southern Chechnya...

213
00:24:25,354 --> 00:24:27,690
Armenia and northern borders of Turkey.

214
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,155
It is a violent neighborhood.

215
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:31,760
Intelligence in the area attributed the attacks...

216
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:37,628
An Afghan militant, Roshan
Gazakov, alias Abu Abdollah...

217
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:40,035
Trained by the British SAS.

218
00:24:40,135 --> 00:24:41,770
Born another jihad.

219
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:45,240

, has a scheduled review...

220
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:49,411
A Gazsnab
pumping station on the outskirts of Tbilisi after tomorrow.

221
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:52,581
He will meet with tribal elders
to settle land disputes.

222
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:54,383
Its mission is to observe.

223
00:24:54,483 --> 00:24:58,749
Sniper Killing enemies with our air support.

224
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:01,190
Gazakov while planning this.

225
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,050
Kept her hidden deep anger
yes...

226
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:06,462
Instructed while the same people who tried to kill him.

227
00:25:06,562 --> 00:25:08,163
This guy is not kidding.

228
00:25:08,263 --> 00:25:09,958
We will provide air support  unmanned.

229
00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:12,201
- Drones?
- Yes

230
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:14,496

The Hammer of God.

232
00:25:16,138 --> 00:25:19,835
I'll be in charge of the operation from my office
JCOC here in Turkey.

233
00:25:20,843 --> 00:25:24,244
This is my stop.
The'll be watching.

234
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:37,459
- Cervantes!
- Mr?

235
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,652
- Cut your hair.
- Yes sir.

236
00:25:42,764 --> 00:25:44,163
Watch your back.

237
00:25:46,602 --> 00:25:48,570

Hey. No hard feelings?

240
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:13,324
Would have been better if you had been more specific about your
business here.

241
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:15,557
The same could be said of you.

242
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:17,699
What we talk later?

243
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,824

246
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:16,058
Do you think they can protect this vast territory
?

247
00:27:16,158 --> 00:27:17,750
Do not worry about my computers.

248
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,523
- How's your air support?
- The whole operation running.

249
00:27:21,897 --> 00:27:24,525
Very clever
detecting a friend of an enemy?

250
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:27,528
Smart enough to detect whatever.

251
00:27:32,975 --> 00:27:34,643
Well, people, listen up.

252
00:27:34,743 --> 00:27:36,311

00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:01,069
<i>He is the one who will ensure...</i>

260
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:04,070
<i>
Eastern Europe does not need Russian gas Ukraine </i>.

261
00:28:04,806 --> 00:28:08,708
It is the subject to which you have to kill
to the most important argument.

262
00:28:10,312 --> 00:28:12,974
Travel with Blackwater contractors...

263
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:17,509

Okay, understood.
It's a nice and rich subject that we must not let die.

268
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:33,191
Mordamos dust.

269
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:53,314
<i>observe from that row of trees.
I can smell them from here </i>.

270
00:29:00,662 --> 00:29:03,893

Caravan, one kilometer.

274
00:29:43,305 --> 00:29:45,967
Talk Suicide.
The package comes behind me.

275
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,992
I have nothing in sight. Really.

276
00:30:04,092 --> 00:30:05,286
Keep watching.

277
00:30:13,168 --> 00:30:15,966
No
objective indicators targeted. Mostly clear.

278
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:21,710
I think I see something.

279
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:25,541
What? What happens out there?
Someone tell me.

280
00:31:05,554 --> 00:31:06,588
They gave Rojas.

281
00:31:06,688 --> 00:31:08,256
<i>I repeat, gave Rojas </i>.

282
00:31:08,356 --> 00:31:11,360
Contact, unknown position.
Falcon, talk to me.

283
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,629
What the hell's going down there?
Falcon, tell me something.

284
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:17,254
The shot came from my right.

285
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,675
Find me a fucking target.

286
00:31:26,775 --> 00:31:30,145
I have nothing in sight, man.
Seriously. Where the hell are they?

287
00:31:30,245 --> 00:31:32,213
Where are my drones?

288
00:31:34,783 --> 00:31:38,253
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
Marines in a firefight.

289
00:31:38,353 --> 00:31:39,718
Let us help.

290
00:31:40,188 --> 00:31:42,383
- Find me a target.
- Copying.

291
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,703
Heat signal unregistered.
Position possible hostage.

292
00:31:54,803 --> 00:31:57,305
- It could be a satellite echo.
- Confirming.

293
00:31:57,405 --> 00:31:59,373
Set to the right 20 degrees.

294
00:32:06,515 --> 00:32:08,107
I gave him one. A fallen man.

295
00:32:10,485 --> 00:32:13,283
Look closely, sir.
Zoom to 500%.

296
00:32:19,127 --> 00:32:21,095
- What is that?
- Armed missiles.

297
00:32:22,197 --> 00:32:23,289
Target achieved.

298
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:24,822
Throw it.

299
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:28,836
MISSILE LAUNCHED

300
00:32:44,486 --> 00:32:45,953
Objective  destroyed.

301
00:32:47,622 --> 00:32:48,850
Good for you.

302
00:33:24,392 --> 00:33:26,451
Rampage, what is your status?

303
00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:35,460
God, Aurelia. Hears.

304
00:33:40,075 --> 00:33:42,407
Rampage, what is your status?

305
00:34:26,921 --> 00:34:29,685
Without confirmation
we assume that Gazakov is still alive.

306
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:35,063
Cap a shootout. It's a...

307
00:34:35,163 --> 00:34:38,064
14.5 mm anti-tank shot.

308
00:34:40,635 --> 00:34:42,034
We dropped something.

309
00:35:00,555 --> 00:35:01,988
Shot impossible.

310
00:35:02,457 --> 00:35:04,288
How the hell they found us?

311
00:35:04,626 --> 00:35:06,321
They shot the hideout Rojas?

312
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:09,760
- Maines?
- Nobody's that good.

313
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,393
And there was no Georgian losses, Colonel.

314
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:16,461
Take care, infant.

315
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:20,475
Rojas could build a better hiding place than any
.

316
00:35:20,575 --> 00:35:22,440
That shot was impossible.

317
00:35:22,811 --> 00:35:24,802
What
trying to say exactly?

318
00:35:25,146 --> 00:35:27,649
No attempt. I say.

319
00:35:27,749 --> 00:35:30,619
You or someone on your team
gives our coordinates Gazakov.

320
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,879
Retire.

321
00:35:33,354 --> 00:35:36,687
Discipline Unit
leaves much to be desired, Mayor.

322
00:35:37,225 --> 00:35:38,749
It's my job, Colonel.

323
00:35:39,327 --> 00:35:40,604
Perhaps not remember the two deaths...

324
00:35:40,628 --> 00:35:42,464
A marín and an American pilot.

325
00:35:42,564 --> 00:35:45,266
I do not remember?
Do you forget who you're talking about?

326
00:35:45,366 --> 00:35:47,357
Americans?
Cry if they are dead!

327
00:35:47,669 --> 00:35:48,795
Damn! You killed her!

328
00:35:51,106 --> 00:35:52,403
Retire!

329
00:35:53,475 --> 00:35:57,377
I'm sick of this damn conversation
and unacceptable behavior.

330
00:35:57,746 --> 00:36:00,340
Honor, courage, devotion.

331
00:36:01,249 --> 00:36:04,047
You. Are Marines. Act as such.

332
00:36:15,196 --> 00:36:21,032
GREAT CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS
4,000 METERS LIFTING

333
00:36:38,253 --> 00:36:39,954
Welcome to Pamir-Alay.

334
00:36:40,054 --> 00:36:43,625
You must have done something very bad
to send you here, brother.

335
00:36:43,725 --> 00:36:47,991
Sector Trans-Georgian,
peaceful area according to official designation Gas Pipeline.

336
00:36:49,063 --> 00:36:50,865
Thanks, I think.

337
00:36:50,965 --> 00:36:53,935
Do you have better shelter that crap?

338
00:36:54,035 --> 00:36:55,637
Are nearly 3,700 kilometers.

339
00:36:55,737 --> 00:36:58,173
Dude, you need a better coat.

340
00:36:58,273 --> 00:37:00,275
So when will all this be stopped
Russia?

341
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:03,208
In 1991, when I was born.

342
00:37:03,745 --> 00:37:05,013
What exactly are you doing here?

343
00:37:05,113 --> 00:37:08,733
Me? I am very skilled. But for now,
'm your new observer.

344
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,970
We'll see.

345
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:02,604
Do not speak English. They are very traditional.

346
00:38:02,704 --> 00:38:05,507
They know these mountains better than anyone.
The Pipeline pays...

347
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:08,201
Better get that bastard
stay away from me.

348
00:38:08,943 --> 00:38:11,309
It gives you a warm welcome to his country
, brother.

349
00:38:43,444 --> 00:38:45,571
Is our American savior?

350
00:38:53,187 --> 00:38:55,815
Sergeant Brandon Beckett shot, sir.

351
00:39:03,331 --> 00:39:06,634
If we continue with this,
men will run out soon.

352
00:39:06,734 --> 00:39:08,224
Then we will be just you and me.

353
00:39:14,142 --> 00:39:16,235
Ready for some action?

354
00:39:18,046 --> 00:39:19,206
Yes.

355
00:39:20,715 --> 00:39:21,841
Good.

356
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,837
This guy attacked a Georgian colonel.

357
00:39:53,815 --> 00:39:55,476
Insubordination.

358
00:39:56,651 --> 00:39:59,518
's What your report says.

359
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,714
Why?

360
00:40:04,926 --> 00:40:07,451
I think he, or someone of lower rank
is a traitor...

361
00:40:08,963 --> 00:40:11,363
Providing secret information to the insurgents.

362
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,394
You think.

363
00:40:14,168 --> 00:40:17,103
Team
enemy snipers placed our exact positions.

364
00:40:17,538 --> 00:40:19,199
It is an easy target.

365
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:23,968
I lost some friends.
Not a Georgian victim.

366
00:40:24,512 --> 00:40:27,777
What persecute
is much bigger than one man.

367
00:40:28,683 --> 00:40:30,514
There is much more at stake.

368
00:40:30,952 --> 00:40:36,447
I suggest gather more evidence before raising the allegations.

369
00:40:36,824 --> 00:40:39,694
It's a little hard to do
more than 1,600 kilometers.

370
00:40:39,794 --> 00:40:40,818
Yes.

371
00:40:41,362 --> 00:40:45,423
It is the old Soviet way of solving problems with big mouths
.

372
00:40:48,669 --> 00:40:52,366
The insurgent sniper could
tell the truth.

373
00:40:54,342 --> 00:40:55,343
Right.

374
00:40:55,443 --> 00:40:56,910
Seriously.

375
00:40:57,545 --> 00:40:59,775
How they say: "From the original source"?

376
00:41:00,448 --> 00:41:03,474
So what I ask only Gazakov?

377
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:06,749
Something of value ...

378
00:41:08,022 --> 00:41:10,217
Offered in exchange for the truth.

379
00:41:20,334 --> 00:41:23,792
- Too fast for you, Brandon?
- I'm fine.

380
00:41:24,238 --> 00:41:28,231
Maybe next time, you will think two times
if you attack a superior officer.

381
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,502
The top of the mountain is good
to "calm down", yes?

382
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:35,984
- So where do we go?
- When listening post.

383
00:41:36,084 --> 00:41:38,219
Spend highly sensitive information...

384
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,399
As size and movement of enemy troops
...

385
00:41:40,443 --> 00:41:42,056
Coordinate surveillance.

386
00:41:42,156 --> 00:41:46,058
If you do not patrol regularly
Chechen thieves take everything.

387
00:42:09,717 --> 00:42:10,911
Idiots!

388
00:42:11,686 --> 00:42:16,851
Do not you know that everything is encrypted, hackers
proof?

389
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:19,552
- What will you do?
- Les shoot.

390
00:42:21,229 --> 00:42:24,392
- "Shoot them"?
- Yes, American. You shoot them.

391
00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:26,591
But they are just thieves.

392
00:42:27,335 --> 00:42:30,133
Thieves
Chechens is not exactly the same.

393
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:33,100
What do you propose we do?

394
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:34,768
Arrest.

395
00:42:37,345 --> 00:42:42,749
Arrest, as John McClane, yes
<i>Die Hard </i>?

396
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:44,582
Something like that.

397
00:42:45,386 --> 00:42:49,720
Well, show more correctly
how. Democratically.

398
00:42:55,029 --> 00:42:56,963
Give me your rifle.

399
00:43:00,368 --> 00:43:03,132
You too. Come on.

400
00:43:08,109 --> 00:43:10,669
Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker!

401
00:43:36,871 --> 00:43:38,805
Stop! Right there!

402
00:43:55,723 --> 00:43:58,157
Help Me. Please.

403
00:44:02,129 --> 00:44:03,255
Do not do it!

404
00:45:01,088 --> 00:45:03,079
Welcome to the Far East.

405
00:45:21,776 --> 00:45:26,736
Your father, Thomas Beckett, is known
me.

406
00:45:28,015 --> 00:45:31,610
At different times, another war.

407
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:36,285
Back then we were adversaries...

408
00:45:38,526 --> 00:45:41,552
Confronting  In the Line of Fire.

409
00:45:47,835 --> 00:45:49,302
South America.

410
00:45:50,571 --> 00:45:54,063
Somehow
kill us avoid each other.

411
00:45:57,244 --> 00:46:00,941
For my heroic efforts in the jungles of Nicaragua...

412
00:46:01,615 --> 00:46:06,314
They were rewarded me with three trips
in the First Chechen War.

413
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:08,518
You Want to try your courage?

414
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,081
Choose a battle with Chechnya.

415
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,750
Before Chechnya...

416
00:46:15,896 --> 00:46:17,261
I was...

417
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,091
A soldier like any other.

418
00:46:22,169 --> 00:46:26,902
That all changed
25 December 1995.

419
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:30,738
It was Christmas in our calendar. Yes.

420
00:46:39,854 --> 00:46:45,554
Our unit was assigned to support
troops in Ingushetiya border.

421
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,231
<i>Many conscripts deserted,
others joined the rebels </i>.

422
00:46:50,331 --> 00:46:52,595
<i>It was impossible to detect
a friend of an enemy </i>.

423
00:46:52,933 --> 00:46:57,233
<i>The squadron
stopped at a city building that seemed safe </i>.

424
00:46:57,838 --> 00:46:59,305
<i>My position was established </i>.

425
00:47:01,675 --> 00:47:04,803
<i>It was my observer, Yuri,
who saw him first, of course </i>.

426
00:47:05,212 --> 00:47:06,577
<i>"Andrei" he said </i>.

427
00:47:08,883 --> 00:47:12,546
<i>"The child
charge something under his coat."</i>

428
00:47:14,288 --> 00:47:16,756
<i>I looked at the child from my sight </i>.

429
00:47:18,726 --> 00:47:20,523
<i>He was only ten years old </i>.

430
00:47:21,929 --> 00:47:25,990
<i>Was a slice of bread
wearing under his coat </i>?

431
00:47:26,734 --> 00:47:27,734
<i>not </i>.

432
00:47:28,335 --> 00:47:29,632
<i>It was a bomb...</i>

433
00:47:31,138 --> 00:47:33,766
<i>made of a mortar shell </i>.

434
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:39,372
<i>My humanity tells me:</i>

435
00:47:40,614 --> 00:47:43,310
<i>"
A little boy found a bomb...</i>

436
00:47:44,618 --> 00:47:48,452
<i>and only wanted to give the soldiers
" </i>.

437
00:48:02,503 --> 00:48:05,165
Snipers doubted.

438
00:48:08,175 --> 00:48:09,574
But only once.

439
00:48:14,048 --> 00:48:18,185
Caucasus Mountains in winter.
Imagine the possible vacation.

440
00:48:18,285 --> 00:48:20,721
Well, if it's any consolation,
the temperature is about 38 ° C.

441
00:48:20,821 --> 00:48:22,123
In the shade.

442
00:48:22,223 --> 00:48:23,924
Consider me inconsolable.

443
00:48:24,024 --> 00:48:27,495
Incidentally, the subject we eliminate
on top, apparently was not Gazakov.

444
00:48:27,595 --> 00:48:29,363
<i>Sources say it was his brother </i>.

445
00:48:29,463 --> 00:48:30,564
Are you sure?

446
00:48:30,664 --> 00:48:34,301
<i>Yes, they have their remains. Incidentally, we deploy
tonight, Gunny </i>.

447
00:48:34,401 --> 00:48:36,562
<i>continue the pipeline to the beach </i>.

448
00:48:36,871 --> 00:48:38,372
We recognize the area...

449
00:48:38,472 --> 00:48:40,702
To ensure it is not repeated
what happened here.

450
00:48:41,075 --> 00:48:42,510
Babayev  Something?

451
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:45,146
No, we checked in detail.
No history.

452
00:48:45,246 --> 00:48:46,736
<i>only passes your test, Gunny </i>.

453
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,644
<i>Keep your head down,
I'll see you around </i>.

454
00:49:31,091 --> 00:49:32,217
Not bad.

455
00:49:32,826 --> 00:49:34,586
The day will come, when Americans
...

456
00:49:34,628 --> 00:49:37,290
They can beat the Russians in winter sports.

457
00:49:37,665 --> 00:49:39,963
1980, hockey.

458
00:49:40,768 --> 00:49:41,928
Lucky shot.

459
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:45,070
2014, Sochi.

460
00:49:45,172 --> 00:49:48,576
Semicircular ramp women.
Gold medals and bronze for EE. UU.

461
00:49:48,676 --> 00:49:51,611
Semicircular? Do not joke.

462
00:49:57,251 --> 00:50:00,354
So how a Russian officer with the 3rd
Spetsnaz Guards Brigade...?

463
00:50:00,454 --> 00:50:04,288
Security ends up working for
a consortium of Eurasian oil?

464
00:50:04,925 --> 00:50:08,656
Do you have any idea why these people
pay a private contractor?

465
00:50:09,463 --> 00:50:12,132
As your Navy Seals working for Blackwater...

466
00:50:12,232 --> 00:50:15,336
Russian special forces,
should strive for profit.

467
00:50:15,436 --> 00:50:18,200
Start again.
Lead a more normal life.

468
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:20,729
Is this normal?

469
00:50:21,508 --> 00:50:25,467
Compared to where we were?
Yes, American, this is normal.

470
00:50:30,751 --> 00:50:33,219
No family, no children.

471
00:50:36,991 --> 00:50:38,822
Few choose this destination ...

472
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,120
But after the first death,
or second...

473
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,395
We become snipers.

474
00:50:45,366 --> 00:50:46,697
We must comply.

475
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:49,401
Without hesitation.

476
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:52,829
All traces of humanity is lost.

477
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:00,408
Beautiful, right?

478
00:51:47,461 --> 00:51:51,625
<i>Colonel, I see the path.
There is movement. They come, Colonel </i>.

479
00:51:52,966 --> 00:51:54,991
An hour, maybe less.

480
00:51:55,669 --> 00:51:58,832
<i>The Chechens come.
Many Chechens </i>.

481
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,775
I will enjoy seeing what...

482
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:04,445
Will make my brother...

483
00:52:04,545 --> 00:52:06,570
And how he will kill you.

484
00:52:20,994 --> 00:52:23,360
I'll kill you first.

485
00:52:24,398 --> 00:52:25,422
Courage!

486
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:40,005
Saajid! There is another, there
behind the rock.

487
00:52:51,492 --> 00:52:53,926
I swear I think I enjoy this.

488
00:52:54,261 --> 00:52:55,956
Another day you die.

489
00:52:56,663 --> 00:52:57,663
Find a hiding place.

490
00:53:02,169 --> 00:53:03,830
Shoot to kill!

491
00:53:06,774 --> 00:53:08,401
Take the eastern slope.

492
00:53:49,716 --> 00:53:53,487
Where the hell are they?
They should have arrived long ago.

493
00:53:53,587 --> 00:53:55,418
That's what they want you to think.

494
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:59,860
Just they do what they were taught.
We want to put forward.

495
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,518
It's working.

496
00:54:02,262 --> 00:54:05,060
Relax. And they will come.

497
00:54:24,418 --> 00:54:25,858
Búscame that sniper, Saajid.

498
00:54:28,455 --> 00:54:31,925
To my left something moved
in the snow. You see?

499
00:54:32,025 --> 00:54:33,549
I see nothing, brother.

500
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,266
Kill a man, he frightens 1,000.
Get ready for a shootout.

501
00:56:40,253 --> 00:56:42,915
Hello to my Russian friend!

502
00:57:09,616 --> 00:57:10,856
Rocket-propelled Granada!

503
00:59:06,133 --> 00:59:09,369
No... I came to help.

504
00:59:09,469 --> 00:59:11,027
Arrojo my gun.

505
01:01:11,725 --> 01:01:14,193
When Saajid
chooses to replace us?

506
01:01:15,862 --> 01:01:20,196
Last month? Yesterday?
Ten minutes ago? Does not matter.

507
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,192
He's dead because he did.

508
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:29,208
What?

509
01:01:29,976 --> 01:01:34,106
You doubted before shooting this cowardly traitor?

510
01:01:48,128 --> 01:01:51,256
- What are they doing here?
- Eyes in the sky.

511
01:01:52,399 --> 01:01:53,559
We ended.

512
01:01:56,102 --> 01:01:57,467
Lesson learned.

513
01:01:58,305 --> 01:02:02,105
Take him there by helicopter.
Put him back in the field.

514
01:02:02,676 --> 01:02:04,473
Understood, Colonel.

515
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:20,421
BASE  OP. GEORGIAN-EE.
UU EAST BATUMI, GEORGIA

516
01:02:20,627 --> 01:02:23,596
<i>Your contact is

01:02:24,664 --> 01:02:27,300

<i>No matter what happens, you have 36 hours
...</i>

520

521
01:02:39,979 --> 01:02:41,139
<i>Good hunting </i>.

522
01:02:45,819 --> 01:02:47,286
I am looking for Mothershed.

523
01:02:48,288 --> 01:02:49,482
You found it.

524
01:02:51,024 --> 01:02:52,719
Zotov sent me.
He said you could...

525
01:02:54,627 --> 01:02:56,229
To help, yes.

526
01:02:56,329 --> 01:02:58,431
Zotov told me all about you.

527
01:02:58,531 --> 01:03:01,334
You're a cowboy and looking to Gazakov.

528
01:03:01,434 --> 01:03:04,771
Yes, it is. Zotov said
you can take me with him.

529
01:03:04,871 --> 01:03:06,429
It is suicidal.

530
01:03:07,307 --> 01:03:08,934
Can you do it or not?

531
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:12,944
Let's say I can help you find him.

532
01:03:14,447 --> 01:03:15,539
And then what?

533
01:03:16,483 --> 01:03:20,317
- Did you ask who your source?
- That's a start.

534
01:03:21,988 --> 01:03:26,550
What business. I compenso.
His brother was an observer.

535
01:03:27,026 --> 01:03:29,062
Yes. I flew into pieces.

536
01:03:29,162 --> 01:03:33,099
What would not Gazakov
by the remains of his brother?

537
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:35,268
Decapitarte, for a piece.

538
01:03:35,368 --> 01:03:39,205
I look forward to taking that risk.
Man to man, is worth the shot.

539
01:03:39,305 --> 01:03:40,840
No, not worth it.

540
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:42,532
That's your opinion.

541
01:03:43,309 --> 01:03:45,436
I pay for having smart.

542
01:03:46,179 --> 01:03:49,273
Can you put together the pieces for me, or not?
I want to go to dawn.

543
01:03:54,387 --> 01:03:56,690
So better not to waste time.

544
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:58,018
What is this?

545
01:04:00,894 --> 01:04:02,486
The peace offer you requested.

546
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:06,865
When I spoke to Zotov,
I knew how it would end all this.

547
01:04:07,901 --> 01:04:09,235
Only this is it?

548
01:04:09,335 --> 01:04:13,169
Yes, after a Hellfire missile
he caught.

549
01:04:16,443 --> 01:04:17,569
According .

550
01:04:18,178 --> 01:04:20,146
We leave at dawn.

551
01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:00,053
What is your job officially
with the pipeline, anyway?

552
01:05:00,153 --> 01:05:01,518
Did you hear that?

553
01:05:02,255 --> 01:05:03,620
I hear nothing.

554
01:05:04,457 --> 01:05:06,982
MQ-1 Predator Drone.

555
01:05:07,894 --> 01:05:11,022
Say "cheese" before we end
in a cigarette box.

556
01:05:21,207 --> 01:05:23,573
We have many signs of heat.

557
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:29,439
Get me Colonel. I have something.

558
01:05:31,284 --> 01:05:34,014
- Officially, I'm a geologist.
- A geologist?

559
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:38,379
The natural gas and oil
make the world, my friend.

560
01:05:38,725 --> 01:05:43,355
The Trans-Georgian Pipeline is the largest in the city
geopolitical game.

561
01:05:43,997 --> 01:05:46,864
Participants
the most important players.

562
01:05:47,534 --> 01:05:50,662
You, me, Gazakov...

563
01:05:51,104 --> 01:05:53,231
We can not even pawns.

564
01:06:02,181 --> 01:06:03,580
We're close.

565
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:05,544
How do you know?

566
01:06:05,952 --> 01:06:08,386
We have been following an hour ago.

567
01:06:09,088 --> 01:06:10,749
What then?

568
01:06:11,691 --> 01:06:14,216
We are waiting to come forward.

569
01:06:18,631 --> 01:06:19,689
What do you have?

570
01:06:20,199 --> 01:06:23,436
Potential hostages
potential high net worth individuals.

571
01:06:23,536 --> 01:06:26,164
- Are you sure?
- I can not confirm, sir.

572
01:06:50,597 --> 01:06:51,757
They arrived.

573
01:06:59,305 --> 01:07:00,305
Put your hands up.

574
01:07:00,873 --> 01:07:02,204
I do not give my gun.

575
01:07:02,942 --> 01:07:04,410
Then you will die.

576
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:06,478
Give me
cigarette box and wait here.

577
01:07:08,915 --> 01:07:09,916
Hello.

578
01:07:10,016 --> 01:07:11,176
Peace be with you.

579
01:07:11,751 --> 01:07:14,151
We brought the remains of Shaheed
Niazof.

580
01:07:16,389 --> 01:07:18,424
It is grateful for the remains of his brother.

581
01:07:18,524 --> 01:07:21,425
You can now
bury him according to Islam.

582
01:07:23,129 --> 01:07:24,926
Colonel, I think you should see this.

583
01:07:28,868 --> 01:07:30,130
What do I see?

584
01:07:30,637 --> 01:07:32,104
Objectives font.

585
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,658
Facial recognition is impossible,
sir. They are masked...

586
01:07:35,682 --> 01:07:38,945
But our men there tell us
is Gazakov land.

587
01:07:39,045 --> 01:07:41,343
How do I know
is not a shepherd with his flock?

588
01:07:42,482 --> 01:07:47,784
The last time I checked, the
pastors do not need guns, sir.

589
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,719
He says that by the will of God
escaped drone attack.

590
01:08:00,433 --> 01:08:02,901
Ask her who gave
sniper location.

591
01:08:09,876 --> 01:08:11,444
She says it was a godsend.

592
01:08:11,544 --> 01:08:15,982
He was not who killed the unfaithful, but God
.

593
01:08:16,082 --> 01:08:17,276
Lying.

594
01:08:18,117 --> 01:08:19,277
Brandon, beware.

595
01:08:23,456 --> 01:08:25,253
His talent God gave it.

596
01:08:26,192 --> 01:08:27,716
This is an insult.

597
01:08:43,843 --> 01:08:48,075
I do not lie.

598
01:08:49,182 --> 01:08:52,117
- The drone is armed?
- Fully armed.

599
01:08:52,952 --> 01:08:54,180
Course.

600
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:57,350
Forgive.
He did not want to be disrespectful.

601
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:01,419
We will win this war.

602
01:09:02,295 --> 01:09:03,819
Perhaps not while I live...

603
01:09:04,997 --> 01:09:08,455
But while living
my children and grandchildren.

604
01:09:09,969 --> 01:09:11,436
We will win.

605
01:09:14,173 --> 01:09:17,939
Now, go away. I'll kill another day.

606
01:09:22,582 --> 01:09:25,118
In no way she could make those shots
without coordinates.

607
01:09:25,218 --> 01:09:26,419
Ask him how he got it.

608
01:09:26,519 --> 01:09:28,282
- Brandon, enough.
- Ask her.

609
01:09:30,356 --> 01:09:31,596
Without precise coordinates...

610
01:09:31,657 --> 01:09:33,648
Could not have
kill the sniper.

611
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:35,755
Who gave you that information?

612
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,399
He seeks justice like you.

613
01:09:46,038 --> 01:09:47,665
Forget yourself, American.

614
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:49,875
Him out.

615
01:10:43,429 --> 01:10:47,195
TBILISI, GEORGIA PUMPING STATION GAZSNAB

616
01:10:51,771 --> 01:10:55,908
I wish someone had told me this stupid move
...

617
01:10:56,008 --> 01:10:58,169
Then I could have said:
"No way".

618
01:10:58,911 --> 01:11:01,175
Until I got there,
I did not know whom he could trust.

619
01:11:03,616 --> 01:11:06,744
What did you sit with Gazakov?

620
01:11:07,486 --> 01:11:09,010
We did not actually sit.

621
01:11:10,122 --> 01:11:12,125
Okay, so what did you learn?

622
01:11:12,225 --> 01:11:14,560
How Gazakov? Nothing.

623
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:16,855
He alone holds the rifle
as God guides his hand.

624
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:19,432
But I noticed something interesting.

625
01:11:19,532 --> 01:11:23,102
One of its members carries a notebook
wrapped around his back.

626
01:11:23,202 --> 01:11:24,567
<i>never stopped looking at her </i>.

627
01:11:25,371 --> 01:11:28,135
- A computer?
- With a satellite link.

628
01:11:28,941 --> 01:11:32,011
That's a very serious piece of hardware for a militant
, do not you think?

629
01:11:32,111 --> 01:11:38,017
Do you think Gazakov
set the location of the units with our drones...?

630
01:11:38,117 --> 01:11:41,254
Using equipment that could be purchased from Amazon?

631
01:11:41,354 --> 01:11:46,382
No. We believe that copied the drone network, real-time
.

632
01:11:47,326 --> 01:11:48,427
Impossible.

633
01:11:48,527 --> 01:11:51,360
Improbable, yes, but not impossible.

634
01:11:54,834 --> 01:11:55,834
Talk  Robin.

635
01:11:56,335 --> 01:11:57,597
Yes, sir.

636
01:11:59,038 --> 01:12:00,038
He's right here.

637
01:12:03,542 --> 01:12:04,702
It is for you.

638
01:12:10,483 --> 01:12:12,348
<i>Wait online, Beckett </i>.

639
01:12:15,621 --> 01:12:16,781
Talk Zeus.

640
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:19,521
- Are we safe?
- Yes sir.

641
01:12:20,293 --> 01:12:22,995
Does anyone want to tell me what the hell's going on?

642
01:12:23,095 --> 01:12:24,430
<i>I do not understand, sir </i>.

643
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:27,166
<i>Well, Sergeant Beckett went
booking...</i>

644
01:12:27,266 --> 01:12:30,803
And had an unauthorized meeting with Gazakov
or punished.

645
01:12:30,903 --> 01:12:32,080
The first time I hear it.

646
01:12:32,104 --> 01:12:33,606
Thus  you manage your people, Major?

647
01:12:33,706 --> 01:12:34,807
No, sir. It is not like this.

648
01:12:34,907 --> 01:12:38,468
Shooting Sergeant Beckett, do you want
definitely pick it out of the field?

649
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:43,015
Just say the word and I can put
at a desk in Egypt.

650
01:12:43,115 --> 01:12:44,350
No, sir.

651
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:45,818
<i>are near the limit, the son </i>.

652
01:12:45,918 --> 01:12:47,920
I can only cover your back for long.

653
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:50,523
Somehow see
transmission surveillance drone.

654
01:12:50,623 --> 01:12:52,124
That's impossible.

655
01:12:52,224 --> 01:12:55,194
They have no intelligence
hardware or network to copy the drones.

656
01:12:55,294 --> 01:12:58,598
Credentials to enter the system
are obtained on the black market.

657
01:12:58,698 --> 01:13:00,723
Nothing that is digital
is absolutely secure.

658
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:04,270
What you're suggesting does not even
to be a feeling.

659
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:05,564
<i>Listen </i>.

660
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:08,875
Accomplish the missions,
I will discuss intelligence.

661
01:13:08,975 --> 01:13:10,910
<i>do not want to talk about this </i>.

662
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:14,814
And you, Mayor, manage your team,
and not the reverse.

663
01:13:14,914 --> 01:13:15,915
Yes, sir.

664
01:13:16,015 --> 01:13:19,285
Sergeant Beckett, I need it back
in the Black Sea with his team.

665
01:13:19,385 --> 01:13:22,479
<i>We have another operation to Killian Archangel
Grün </i>.

666
01:13:22,955 --> 01:13:26,592
Now, I do not want this becomes
another damn show as before.

667
01:13:26,692 --> 01:13:27,894
<i>Do you hear me, Major </i>?

668
01:13:27,994 --> 01:13:30,363
Yes, sir. damn show, the last.

669
01:13:30,463 --> 01:13:35,162
Good. I'm counting on you.
Now go back to work.

670
01:13:45,444 --> 01:13:50,016
Jsoc01:
Any response concerning the ghost shooter?

671
01:13:50,116 --> 01:13:56,116
Slatcfc02: CFC
confirmed that data is safe and that there is no breach.

672
01:13:56,622 --> 01:13:58,991
Jsoc01: That checked for twice.

673
01:13:59,091 --> 01:14:03,221
Archangel is mission critical.
We need to be sure.

675
01:14:47,139 --> 01:14:49,607
Hello. Welcome back to the party.

676
01:14:50,376 --> 01:14:51,978
I thought you'd left us, brother.

677
01:14:52,078 --> 01:14:54,981
I froze for a while.
Where are Barnes and Aungst?

678
01:14:55,081 --> 01:14:56,700
The radio is mute from 9:00 a. m.

679
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,751
Next review scheduled at 14:00 p. m.

680
01:14:58,851 --> 01:15:00,119
Mountains and ravines, man.

681

We must find them.
The use for target practice.

682
01:15:34,987 --> 01:15:36,122
Zeus, I have nothing.

683
01:15:36,222 --> 01:15:38,169
Intelligence says that Gazakov is here.

684
01:15:38,269 --> 01:15:40,393
We are here to support long-range
.

685
01:15:40,493 --> 01:15:44,486
Let him do his thing, Suicide.
The troop is 90 seconds.

686
01:15:59,712 --> 01:16:02,192
Snipers in the grove south, confirming coordinates.

687
01:16:02,381 --> 01:16:05,217
One Man Only at the top north.

Arboleda  south, right?

689
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,249
Yes, God's will.

Georgian troops
dirt road on your left.

691
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:24,895
Get the snipers.

692
01:16:31,076 --> 01:16:34,480
Shots are made. contáctense troops.
Where the hell is the shooter?

693
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:36,946
- I can not find him.
- Dammit! Me neither.

694
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:45,748
Find me a target.

695
01:17:16,855 --> 01:17:19,756
Team Snipers,
500 meters to the right.

696
01:17:26,799 --> 01:17:28,323
The shot came from my direct front.

697
01:17:30,903 --> 01:17:32,700
White House, second floor window.

698
01:17:50,589 --> 01:17:51,790
We have a victim!

699
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:53,221

Our GPS is interfered.

707

Stay with me. Please.

Suicide, speaks Zeus. Take off your vest.

709
01:18:37,636 --> 01:18:38,728
Desplacémonos!

710
01:18:42,775 --> 01:18:45,039
Let's get out of here now!

711
01:18:47,646 --> 01:18:49,375
Stay with me, Aungst. Come on.

712
01:19:12,905 --> 01:19:14,372
She has lost a lot of blood!

713
01:19:29,154 --> 01:19:30,815
Clear.

714
01:19:38,097 --> 01:19:39,621
Marchen, quick!

715
01:19:39,765 --> 01:19:41,166
How are we, Major?

716
01:19:41,266 --> 01:19:45,134
Better since we took
vests and GPS. He almost saved our lives.

717
01:19:57,049 --> 01:19:58,073
What do we get?

718
01:19:59,017 --> 01:20:00,445
It was an ambush, sir.

719
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:02,187
They interfered definitely our network.

720
01:20:02,287 --> 01:20:04,915
It's bad enough drones,
Brandon.

721
01:20:05,858 --> 01:20:08,622
I tell you can see
what we can see.

722
01:20:10,028 --> 01:20:11,689
This is your problem, Mayor.

723
01:20:12,264 --> 01:20:14,494
No, our problem, Robin.

724
01:20:15,367 --> 01:20:17,164
The Colonel is a good friend.

725
01:20:17,703 --> 01:20:20,213
I can not imagine that
happy to read the reports...

726
01:20:20,313 --> 01:20:24,976
I will send to Brussels
concerning the operations of CFCs in my country.

727
01:20:37,923 --> 01:20:39,550
Attention on deck.

728
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,252
While they were.

729
01:20:44,897 --> 01:20:46,398
What the hell happened out there?

730
01:20:46,498 --> 01:20:49,201
We were warned by radio traffic not guaranteed...

731
01:20:49,301 --> 01:20:52,071
Gazakov who hid in a village west of here.

732
01:20:52,171 --> 01:20:56,403
We popped, we were.
And it was a trap.

733
01:20:57,476 --> 01:21:02,675
They had our positions.
The GPS was completely interfered.

734
01:21:03,282 --> 01:21:05,684
They shot to the top pilot Aungst.

735
01:21:05,784 --> 01:21:08,344
She is on a flight to Germany
for the cure.

736
01:21:09,288 --> 01:21:13,987
Perhaps the history of drone
Gunny was true.

737
01:21:16,929 --> 01:21:20,763
I have my orders, too, gentlemen,
and do not have much time.

738
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,933
I'll check.

739
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:28,031
Les
strike back and will be hard.

740
01:21:28,674 --> 01:21:31,074
Turn off GPS, is that clear?

741
01:21:31,677 --> 01:21:32,837
Yes, sir.

742
01:21:33,812 --> 01:21:35,109
Keep marines.

743
01:21:50,896 --> 01:21:54,161
<i>Killian Grün is here to observe
Operation Archangel in action </i>.

744
01:21:54,766 --> 01:21:57,236
<i>Destroy Gazakov and strength...</i>

745
01:21:57,336 --> 01:22:01,534
<i>that they continue to operate in Kobuleti
and South Georgia </i>.

746
01:22:02,474 --> 01:22:06,114
These areas have seen increased attacks by ISIS
...

747
01:22:06,214 --> 01:22:08,811
On NGO workers and civilians.

748
01:22:11,917 --> 01:22:13,646
As you will see in your package...

749
01:22:14,286 --> 01:22:16,688
This is a stock photograph
satellite...

750
01:22:16,788 --> 01:22:18,666
Indicating that Gazakov near Kobuleti...

751
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:19,930
Compression station Kobuleti

752
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:22,795
Preparing to attack this season here tomorrow...

753
01:22:22,895 --> 01:22:25,420
<i>
destroy and kill all staff </i>.

754
01:22:26,098 --> 01:22:31,331
<i>We estimate that between 40 and 50
enemy combatants in Kobuleti now </i>.

755
01:22:31,670 --> 01:22:35,407
<i>know of the arrival of Archangel here
which is more incentive to attack </i>.

756
01:22:35,507 --> 01:22:38,911
<i>As you know,
Gazakov and his ilk are bad </i>.

757
01:22:39,011 --> 01:22:41,880
<i>No
differentiate between hard and soft targets...</i>

758
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:44,026
And are known for attacking
meeting places...

759
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:46,610
Restaurants, tourist sites.

760
01:22:49,121 --> 01:22:50,315
My God!

761
01:22:51,456 --> 01:22:52,591
Recommendations?

762
01:22:52,691 --> 01:22:56,061
Evacuate all non-essential personnel
offices Kobuleti.

763
01:22:56,161 --> 01:22:59,494
Intercept and capture insurgents before they could get there.

764
01:23:07,105 --> 01:23:09,708
How many additional troops
can put on the ground there?

765
01:23:09,808 --> 01:23:13,245
For reasons of time, not many.
But you can increase the number of UAVs.

766
01:23:13,345 --> 01:23:16,872
Two more units in the air at dusk
double our firepower.

767
01:23:17,516 --> 01:23:20,713
<i>The intercept in Kobuleti
before they get there </i>.

768
01:23:23,689 --> 01:23:25,624
Do you really think it's a good idea?

769
01:23:25,724 --> 01:23:27,419
I think it's the only idea.

770
01:23:29,027 --> 01:23:31,964
What if Beckett is right?
What if they are in our system?

771
01:23:32,064 --> 01:23:34,366
If can you see what we see?

772
01:23:34,466 --> 01:23:35,694
They are not in our system.

773
01:23:36,501 --> 01:23:38,526
And you're 100% sure?

774
01:23:39,471 --> 01:23:43,275
Rather be 80% sure that before
100% sure late.

775
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:46,538
Understood, Major.
Why we not use the GPS.

776
01:23:50,115 --> 01:23:53,085
According . We know our role here.
We do not like.

777
01:23:53,185 --> 01:23:55,220
Do not do these missions,
we carry them out.

778
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,322
You had a problem with that,
not divulge.

779
01:23:57,422 --> 01:23:59,224
What about the web team?
Are we out of network?

780
01:23:59,324 --> 01:24:00,926
They recommended modification.

781
01:24:01,026 --> 01:24:04,723
If you have not been done, pull out your GPS.
We retired at 3:00 a. m.

782
01:24:07,566 --> 01:24:10,160
What was the evidence of the insurgent movement
Kobuleti?

783
01:24:10,736 --> 01:24:12,271
Drones.

784
01:24:12,371 --> 01:24:14,606
What about in Kobuleti?

785
01:24:14,706 --> 01:24:17,402
The Gazsnab headquarters.
Easy targets.

786
01:24:18,143 --> 01:24:19,711
Well, what's in Batumi?

787
01:24:19,811 --> 01:24:21,914
You know what's in Batumi, Gunny.
Since we were there.

788
01:24:22,014 --> 01:24:23,749
Morning will attack.

789
01:24:23,849 --> 01:24:26,900
Exactly.
Just left the pumping station...

790
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,321
For full transfer to the Black Sea.

791
01:24:29,421 --> 01:24:33,187
If the attack,
900 kilometers of pipeline will be lost.

792
01:24:34,393 --> 01:24:37,796
According . But I saw
insurrectionist movement with my own eyes.

793
01:24:37,896 --> 01:24:39,731
They target  Kobuleti.

794
01:24:39,831 --> 01:24:41,924
But how
transmit the coordinates?

795
01:24:42,024 --> 01:24:44,097
Let me guess, the network drone.

796
01:24:45,570 --> 01:24:48,440
Can you give me the location of equipment
enemy sniper?

797
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:50,375
For the greatness of God, yes.

798
01:24:50,475 --> 01:24:53,145
No GPS data now,
but were seen leaving Gazsnab.

799
01:24:53,245 --> 01:24:54,245
GPS TRACKING SYSTEM

800
01:24:54,813 --> 01:24:58,750
So what they believe
we meet in Kobuleti?

801
01:24:58,850 --> 01:25:02,581
Yes, it seems. Pass
false information was easy.

802
01:25:05,223 --> 01:25:08,300
Georgian forces
endure to fight the enemy, but that leaves...

803
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,524
Killian
Grün and station pumping vulnerable to attack.

804
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:15,261
Is an action that confusing, sir.
Tomorrow is today.

805
01:25:15,901 --> 01:25:17,069
Call Colonel.

806
01:25:17,169 --> 01:25:19,433
We lost our link
makes 15 clicks, sir.

807
01:25:21,173 --> 01:25:22,504
Then, changes direction.

808
01:25:24,309 --> 01:25:25,811
Change direction.

809
01:25:25,911 --> 01:25:27,344
You better be right.

810
01:26:29,608 --> 01:26:31,700
What if
is not only GPS information?

811
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,942
What if you can see
what we can see?

812
01:26:35,213 --> 01:26:37,749
<i>I do not know what to say, Colonel.
Our people checked </i>.

813
01:26:37,849 --> 01:26:40,511
<i>If they get information
is from another source.</i>

814
01:26:42,788 --> 01:26:45,484
It's too quiet.
Something's wrong.

815
01:26:45,957 --> 01:26:47,793
I feel it in my bones.

816
01:26:47,893 --> 01:26:52,193
I do not trust completely in bones.
I trust zeros and ones.

817
01:26:57,402 --> 01:27:00,047
There is no indication of enemy sniper teams
or support troops.

818
01:27:00,071 --> 01:27:02,274
Our
infrared heat signals are suppressed.

819
01:27:02,374 --> 01:27:06,504
Send a message to others.
Grün must be captured alive.

820
01:27:15,887 --> 01:27:19,323
This game is a binary.
It is aggressive intelligence.

821
01:27:32,370 --> 01:27:33,860
- My God!
- What is this?

822
01:27:38,844 --> 01:27:39,902
Are you okay?

823
01:27:45,984 --> 01:27:48,919
Gunny  Beckett was right.
They Sacaron UAV information network!

824
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:53,924
Get reinforcements.

825
01:27:56,494 --> 01:27:58,394
Get him out of here now!

826
01:28:09,641 --> 01:28:11,476
Command CFC, Robin Slater talks...

827
01:28:11,576 --> 01:28:14,679
Identification code 0-2-9-Niner-8-0-9.

828
01:28:14,779 --> 01:28:18,374
attack.
I repeat attack us.

829
01:28:25,657 --> 01:28:29,327
Canceled flights UAVs
to Batumi, Georgia.

830
01:28:29,427 --> 01:28:31,793
Cancel the CFC aircraft.

831
01:28:32,430 --> 01:28:35,700
Authorization for ships landing UAV for later review.

832
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:38,436
"Further Testing"?
Landing now.

833
01:28:38,536 --> 01:28:41,004
They are extracting data network
and who knows what else.

834
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,651
Parks  anywhere.
Find a hiding now.

835
01:29:20,645 --> 01:29:23,739
Really, guys? Who
testicles cut off first?

836
01:29:32,424 --> 01:29:33,789
I need ammunition.

837
01:29:37,996 --> 01:29:39,064
Zeus, speaking Rampage.

838
01:29:39,164 --> 01:29:41,533
With the look we got the goal,
out.

839
01:29:41,633 --> 01:29:44,035
I do not remember
given permission to enter, Rampage.

840
01:29:44,135 --> 01:29:46,865
- My mistake.
- Now kill those bastards.

841
01:29:52,610 --> 01:29:53,730
Snipers. Look for them.

842
01:30:20,672 --> 01:30:22,474
Suicide, have you made contact?

843
01:30:22,574 --> 01:30:24,599
Suicide  shake hands with the devil,
sir.

844
01:30:26,411 --> 01:30:27,708
Well, ármenlo, boys.

845
01:30:32,150 --> 01:30:34,015
Team bombing, on my left.

846
01:30:39,758 --> 01:30:43,387
Authorization Approved, Ms. Slater.
Clearing his ship now...

847
01:30:48,967 --> 01:30:50,434
We have lost our infrared.

848
01:30:50,702 --> 01:30:52,226
Keep looking.

849
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:55,801
Find Gazakov. Is here.
I can feel it.

850
01:30:58,943 --> 01:31:00,069
No, down!

851
01:31:04,849 --> 01:31:06,817
In front of you, brother. On my right.

852
01:31:09,504 --> 01:31:10,504
Not him.

853
01:31:10,604 --> 01:31:12,283
Who cares?
Lower the damn Muji.

854
01:31:24,736 --> 01:31:25,964
Where are you?

855
01:31:38,316 --> 01:31:40,614
We have a rabbit, brother.
Gazakov up.

856
01:32:01,172 --> 01:32:02,332
Damn!

857
01:32:07,612 --> 01:32:09,581
Damn!

858
01:32:09,681 --> 01:32:11,080
Are you okay, buddy?

859
01:32:11,616 --> 01:32:15,074
Yes, have the look and kills the trash.

860
01:33:14,078 --> 01:33:15,636
Rampage, what is your status?

861
01:33:16,614 --> 01:33:20,516
Talk Rampage. Low hostage.
I need a doctor!

862
01:33:24,355 --> 01:33:26,289
You should see the other guy.

863
01:33:37,035 --> 01:33:38,345
- Well done, son.
- Thank my Lord.

864
01:33:38,369 --> 01:33:39,609
Brandon, I want to talk to you.

865
01:33:47,946 --> 01:33:53,009
Some time ago, I told your father
it was just a murderer.

866
01:33:54,185 --> 01:33:58,383
I was wrong.
He had courage and guts.

867
01:34:00,024 --> 01:34:01,889
You are worthy son of your father, Gunny.

868
01:34:03,428 --> 01:34:04,986
I See you in the next.

869
01:34:13,771 --> 01:34:14,897
See.

870
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:03,781
It's good to be back, boys.
I missed you.

871
01:35:04,455 --> 01:35:07,322
A team is what I like to see.

872
01:35:09,093 --> 01:35:11,061
Disappeared there, Colonel.

873
01:35:11,663 --> 01:35:13,824
You know how it is. I had things to do.

874
01:35:15,033 --> 01:35:17,797
But I wanted to go and say:
"Well done."

875
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:21,065
It means a lot if it comes from you, sir
.

876
01:35:22,273 --> 01:35:25,208
But I thought I should tell
who transferred me.

877
01:35:25,643 --> 01:35:27,445
I thought he had retired.

878
01:35:27,545 --> 01:35:29,706
I retire otherwise.

879
01:35:30,181 --> 01:35:33,952
I'll still be with the CFC,
but direct field operations.

880
01:35:34,052 --> 01:35:36,111
The I observe more closely.

881
01:35:38,456 --> 01:35:40,686
I brought someone to see you.

882
01:35:49,033 --> 01:35:50,933
Colonel, take a chair.

883
01:36:06,284 --> 01:36:07,546
You were right.
