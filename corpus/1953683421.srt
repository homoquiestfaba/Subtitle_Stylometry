Hey, Chingu!

(engine turns over)

200
00:13:29,673 --> 00:13:31,641
Buy a new car.

201
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:33,472
Time to junk your oxcart.

202
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,704
(laughter)

203
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:36,235

Yes, we still had the prestige

00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,009

205
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:39,413
Abu, we need a new car.

206
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,714
But our bank account was empty.

207
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:44,277
And retire this magnificent chariot?

208
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:45,549
Nonsense.

209
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:48,786
These new-money scoundrels
are ruining the place.

pack other people up

it's shipping...

Herman, are you okay?

432

Oh, man.
Yeah, I'm good.

433
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:00,961
You all right?

434
00:23:00,995 --> 00:23:02,087
Oh, I hope I got that.

435
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,598

You're not hurt, are you?

437
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:07,564
No, lost a couple of inches of hair,

438
00:23:07,602 --> 00:23:09,900
but apart from that...

439
00:23:09,938 --> 00:23:11,530
Oh, you know what?
It's a little out of focus.

440
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:13,666
Excuse me!

441
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,107
Could you do that again?

442

Do... do that again?

Oh, thanks.

446
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:25,346
All right.

00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:27,149
Like, one or two feet higher.

448
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:29,088
Come on.
Go fly, Herman.

449
00:23:29,123 --> 00:23:31,250
I'll strap my wings on.

450
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:32,453
I'm sorry.

451
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:33,962
Is this, like, a magazine
shoot or something?

452
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,395
No, no, no.
It's not that official.

453
00:23:35,431 --> 00:23:38,332
I'm just photographing
these guys for a new project.

454
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:40,130
I wasn't trying
to kill you, so...

455
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,431
And I won't kill you.
I promise.

456
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,767
We'll see.

457
00:23:42,805 --> 00:23:44,466
In Lahore... in Pakistan,
where I'm from...

458
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,839
kids don't fly on skateboards;
they fly kites.

459
00:23:46,876 --> 00:23:48,207
Kites?
Really?

460
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,572
I don't know your name.

461
00:23:52,615 --> 00:23:53,809
- Oh, Changez.
- Ah.

462
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,613
Stay on your mark, Changez.

463
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:57,812

That's right.
Very good.

465
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:01,680
Okay, Herman?

466
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:03,192
He's coming, isn't he?

467
00:24:03,226 --> 00:24:04,693
He's coming.
I can feel him.

468
00:24:04,728 --> 00:24:06,286
(chuckles)

469
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:08,024
(dull grinding)

470
00:24:08,064 --> 00:24:09,622
- Whoo!
- Sweet, Herman!

471
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:10,655
(laughs)

472
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,031
Great.
Okay.

473
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:13,365
- Right.
- Sorry, got to run.

474
00:24:14,838 --> 00:24:16,703
Is there a way I can...

475
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,833
Hey.
You're my William Tell.

476
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,308
You know,
with the apple and the...

477
00:24:20,343 --> 00:24:21,310
Right.

478
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:22,470
Shot it.

479
00:24:22,512 --> 00:24:23,570
Bye.

480
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:26,439
Wainwright.

481
00:24:26,483 --> 00:24:27,643
Mm!

482
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:30,676
Couldn't get the number,
could you, Mobutu?

483
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,187
He was right.

484
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:33,553
I'd missed my moment.

485
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:37,292
Here I am rambling on,

486
00:24:37,328 --> 00:24:38,955
and I haven't offered you
anything to eat.

487
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:39,963
I'm sorry.

488
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:41,055
Junaid!

489
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:42,224
Yes, Khan, sir.

490
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:44,734
Get us a chicken curry.

491
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:47,101
Dall and two naans.

492
00:24:47,138 --> 00:24:48,969
Okay?

493
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:51,634
A rogani naan for me.

494
00:24:51,676 --> 00:24:52,734
Wow.

495
00:24:54,011 --> 00:24:55,308
I think I'm growing on him.

496
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,913
Students...

497
00:24:57,949 --> 00:25:00,747
The police are here
for your protection.

498
00:25:00,785 --> 00:25:02,412
Do not interfere

499
00:25:02,453 --> 00:25:06,082
with Professor Rainier's
investigation.

500
00:25:06,123 --> 00:25:07,591
Do not forget,

501
00:25:07,626 --> 00:25:13,030
demonstrating and disrupting
the peace is forbidden.

502
00:25:13,065 --> 00:25:15,033
We advise you
to return to class

503
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:17,695
and cooperate
with the police.

504
00:25:17,736 --> 00:25:21,763
It's serious.
The police are everywhere.

505
00:25:21,807 --> 00:25:23,104
Forget them.

506
00:25:23,141 --> 00:25:24,768
Poetry is serious too.

507
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,334
As Khan sir says...

508
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:30,280
"The most transcendent poetry
is, by definition, political. "

509
00:25:30,315 --> 00:25:33,478
So you want poetry
to do the protesting?

510
00:25:33,518 --> 00:25:35,452
Why not?

511
00:25:35,487 --> 00:25:36,977
Mm.

512
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:38,216
All well, sir?

513
00:25:38,257 --> 00:25:40,782
You're always where
the food is, no?

514
00:25:40,827 --> 00:25:42,692
Why aren't you at home
marking these exams?

515
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:44,697
Yeah, well...

516
00:25:44,731 --> 00:25:46,790
Ahmad and those guys
wanted me to protest,

517
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:47,857
but you know me.

518
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,492
I need lunch
before I can protest.

519
00:25:50,637 --> 00:25:52,400
Presenting the militant academic.

520
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:53,700
(chuckles)

521
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,970
Bobby Lincoln, this is my
teaching assistant, Sameer.

522
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:57,977
Watch out.
He knows Urdu.

523
00:25:58,011 --> 00:26:00,343
Peace be upon you.

524
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,506
And you.

525
00:26:01,547 --> 00:26:02,912
Peace be with you, brothers.

526
00:26:02,949 --> 00:26:06,146
Ali, start your protest
so I can go home!

527
00:26:06,185 --> 00:26:08,278
So, Bobby, I must ask you.

528
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:11,553
Why do you think they'd
be harassing my family?

529
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:15,820
I can't speak for the
American authorities,

530
00:26:15,863 --> 00:26:17,330
but I think it's safe to assume

531
00:26:17,364 --> 00:26:19,332
they consider you
a person of interest.

532
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:22,767
And they make these decisions
with what evidence?

533
00:26:22,803 --> 00:26:25,738
So how do... how do I
become uninteresting?

534
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:32,939
Look, Changez,

535
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,948
the kidnapping of an
American citizen

536
00:26:34,982 --> 00:26:37,678
is about as heavy
as it gets for them.

537
00:26:37,718 --> 00:26:40,380
And I'm sure if you were willing
to go in and talk to them,

538
00:26:40,421 --> 00:26:41,855
they'd probably be able
to help you.

539
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,118
You think I had something to do

540
00:26:43,158 --> 00:26:45,786
with this kidnapping, Bobby?

541
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:47,351
I'm not the one you
have to convince.

542
00:26:47,395 --> 00:26:49,124
Is that the first lie you've
told me today?

543
00:26:49,164 --> 00:26:50,791
They've got Asif.

544
00:26:50,832 --> 00:26:53,801
(men speaking Urdu)

545
00:26:57,639 --> 00:26:59,197
Some things are heating up.

546
00:27:01,276 --> 00:27:02,903
- I know nothing.
- Give us their names!

547
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:05,640
(men speaking Urdu)

548
00:27:07,282 --> 00:27:08,271
I must warn you, Bobby,

549
00:27:08,316 --> 00:27:09,874
I find it very difficult
to confess all

550
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:12,148
to a man I know so little about.

551
00:27:12,187 --> 00:27:13,712
Fair enough.
What do you want to know?

552
00:27:13,756 --> 00:27:16,281
Well, what drew you
to our part of the world?

553
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:18,020
(chuckles)

554
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,254
Well, for one thing,

555
00:27:19,295 --> 00:27:20,694
it's a hell of a lot
more interesting

556
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,095
than Paterson, New Jersey.

557
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:27,963
"Your nest is not atop the
dome of a royal palace.

558
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:32,303
"Your next is not atop

Your candor is appreciated, Bobby,

883

but your conclusions are wrong.

884
00:44:35,662 --> 00:44:37,459
See, all this rhetoric such as,

885
00:44:37,497 --> 00:44:40,296

of the invaders from our sword,"

886
00:44:40,334 --> 00:44:42,529

It's satisfying
when times are lean,

888

889
00:44:45,306 --> 00:44:46,637

00:44:48,009 --> 00:44:49,169
Now, I may be an opponent

892
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:50,768
of American interference in Pakistan

893
00:44:50,812 --> 00:44:52,336

own generals.

897
00:45:01,522 --> 00:45:03,820

A madrasah is a place

899
00:45:05,526 --> 00:45:06,925

900
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:09,555
My work takes me
to all kinds of places,

901
00:45:09,597 --> 00:45:11,395
just as your work
has brought you here.

902
00:45:11,433 --> 00:45:12,991
My thinking
is that knowledge is power,

903
00:45:13,035 --> 00:45:15,663
not just religious knowledge but...

904
00:45:15,704 --> 00:45:17,365
You say guilty people hide.

905
00:45:17,406 --> 00:45:20,034
So do people who feel hunted.

906
00:45:20,075 --> 00:45:22,373
I missed my lectures for
a much more direct reason.

907
00:45:22,411 --> 00:45:24,379
What the hell is this?

908
00:45:24,413 --> 00:45:26,313
They entered my home

909
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,179

914
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:37,121
Three agency bastards
showed up.

915
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:38,456
We have to get you
to a hospital.

916
00:45:38,493 --> 00:45:40,358
Changez, they attack your uncle.

917
00:45:40,395 --> 00:45:42,226
They follow Ammi around
in the Sabzi Mandi.

918
00:45:42,264 --> 00:45:44,699
Why this massive campaign
against you?

919
00:45:44,734 --> 00:45:46,531
Ammi, this is all going to stop, okay?

920
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:48,059
I promise you.

921
00:45:48,104 --> 00:45:51,073

I was in Takhar Province,
Afghanistan.

to Ahmad Shah Massoud.

I know he had blood
on his hands,

981

but he stood for something,

982
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:35,097
meant something to people,

983
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:37,192

we didn't need to be there.

Massoud never got the chance
to read my book.

- Give him his tea.
- No, no, please.

1102
00:57:09,906 --> 00:57:11,430
Don't embarrass me.

1103
00:57:11,474 --> 00:57:13,908
You are like my brother.

1104
00:57:13,944 --> 00:57:15,002
Thanks.

1105
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,945
I might have been suited
and booted,

1106
00:57:18,982 --> 00:57:21,645
but I felt just as vulnerable
as they did.

1107
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,979
There was only one place
I felt safe...

1108
00:57:26,324 --> 00:57:27,621
With her.

1109
00:57:27,658 --> 00:57:29,216
You want to learn
how to say "love"?

1110
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,727
Yeah.

1111
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:32,558
There's not just one way
of saying it.

1112
00:57:32,597 --> 00:57:34,827
- There's, like, two or three.
- Okay, okay.

1113
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,730
Okay, so there's ishq.

1114
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:40,786
Ishq.

1115
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:42,335
Ishq.

1116
00:57:42,373 --> 00:57:44,238
(chuckles)

1117
00:57:44,275 --> 00:57:45,242
Ishq.

1118
00:57:45,276 --> 00:57:46,903
Mm.
Well done.

1119
00:57:46,944 --> 00:57:49,913
And then there's pyaar.

1120
00:57:49,947 --> 00:57:52,280
Pyaar.

1121
00:57:52,317 --> 00:57:53,375
That's quite good.

1122
00:57:53,418 --> 00:57:54,407
Yeah?
(laughs)

1123
00:57:54,453 --> 00:57:56,580
- You're good at this.
- Pyaar.

1124
00:57:56,622 --> 00:57:58,487
You said this word before
to someone?

1125
00:57:58,523 --> 00:57:59,888
Ishq.
Pyaar.

1126
00:57:59,925 --> 00:58:02,223
This isn't your first time, is it?

1127
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:05,787
(laughing)

1128
00:58:05,831 --> 00:58:08,823

Mohabbat.

I can't believe
they're not there.

♪

1136
00:59:15,836 --> 00:59:16,996
It's crazy.

1137
00:59:18,372 --> 00:59:20,670
It was a time of uncertainty.

1138
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:23,871
For me, the only things certain
were love and profit.

1139
00:59:25,379 --> 00:59:27,575
It wasn't long before the
economic laws of nature

1140
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,583
reasserted themselves.

1141
00:59:29,617 --> 00:59:32,916
Small companies were again
swallowed up by big ones.

1142
00:59:32,954 --> 00:59:35,218
Those that didn't grow would die.

1143
00:59:36,758 --> 00:59:38,919
Some stakeholders are obviously
you people right here.

1144
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,154
That's why need to revisit...

1145
00:59:40,195 --> 00:59:41,890
For the 25 years that
I've worked here,

1146
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,557
per union rules,

1147
00:59:43,598 --> 00:59:45,293
we only take those requests
in writing.

1148
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:46,459
See, with due respect,

1149
00:59:46,501 --> 00:59:48,765
that is exactly the kind
of bureaucratic mind-set

1150
00:59:48,803 --> 00:59:50,031
we're trying to challenge here.

1151
00:59:50,071 --> 00:59:51,698
I am not a bureaucrat.

1152
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,105
We don't have to like each other.

1153
00:59:53,141 --> 00:59:54,870
We just have to get the job done.

1154
00:59:54,909 --> 00:59:56,308
Now, pull out the union contracts.

1155
00:59:56,344 --> 00:59:57,834
We might need to cancel
some of them.

1156
00:59:59,882 --> 01:00:01,543
- He's young.
- I've worked here 25 years.

1157
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:03,415
What the hell am I supposed to do?

1158
01:00:03,452 --> 01:00:05,113
(indistinct conversations)

1159
01:00:27,343 --> 01:00:28,537
Hi, stranger.

1160
01:00:28,577 --> 01:00:30,010
When are you coming back?

1161
01:00:30,045 --> 01:00:31,206
I miss you.

1162
01:01:11,489 --> 01:01:14,583
Fuck you, Osama.

1163
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:15,785
(spits)

1164
01:01:25,436 --> 01:01:26,903
A tiny slice of violence

1165
01:01:26,938 --> 01:01:28,929
had wormed its way into my life,

1166
01:01:28,973 --> 01:01:31,066
and I didn't know
how to remove it.

1167
01:01:38,383 --> 01:01:41,511
What was soft inside me
fell away.

1168
01:01:41,553 --> 01:01:44,215
What was hard became harder.

1169
01:01:47,693 --> 01:01:50,685
(electronic beeping)

1170
01:01:52,631 --> 01:01:54,565
Talk to me, Bobby.
What's going on?

1171
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,033
I need more time.

1172
01:01:56,068 --> 01:01:59,595
You're exposed, and the clock
is ticking on Rainier.

1173
01:01:59,638 --> 01:02:00,798
Turn your target now,

1174
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:02,033
or we're taking him to Peshawar

1175
01:02:02,074 --> 01:02:03,541
to put the screws on him.

1176
01:02:03,575 --> 01:02:04,633
Okay.

1177
01:02:09,816 --> 01:02:11,613
What did Massoud do
to members of his force

1178
01:02:11,651 --> 01:02:13,516
that collaborated
with the Taliban?

1179
01:02:15,054 --> 01:02:16,214
He slit their throats.

1180
01:02:16,256 --> 01:02:17,416
Yes, he did.

1181
01:02:18,992 --> 01:02:21,358
Do you want that
to happen to me, Bobby?

1182
01:02:21,394 --> 01:02:23,589
Is there something
you're not telling me?

1183
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:25,291
Juniad, look at that.

1184
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:27,857
Careful.

1185
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:28,959
Watch out.

1186
01:02:29,969 --> 01:02:31,869
Brother...

1187
01:02:31,905 --> 01:02:34,271
Khan, sir, let's go down.

1188
01:02:37,176 --> 01:02:38,337
Hurry.

1189
01:02:40,247 --> 01:02:42,215
Each moment is precious,
Bobby.

1190
01:02:42,249 --> 01:02:44,308
Come.
It's time to go inside.

1191
01:02:44,351 --> 01:02:47,047
Where is the security guard?

1192
01:02:59,133 --> 01:03:01,101
Hello?

1193
01:03:01,135 --> 01:03:02,864
I'm talking to you, Ma.
Hello?

1194
01:03:02,903 --> 01:03:04,393
(speaking Urdu)

1195
01:03:04,438 --> 01:03:05,996
Keep the candles safely.

1196
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,168
Trouble could break out anytime.

1197
01:03:09,209 --> 01:03:12,907
The sweets go in the kitchen,
the soft drinks too.

1198
01:03:12,948 --> 01:03:15,246
Ma, you're being stubborn.

1199
01:03:15,283 --> 01:03:17,308
I'll make one phone call
to the caterers.

1200
01:03:17,352 --> 01:03:19,183
They will handle everything, okay?

1201
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,814
Baita, with the shortages,
the prices have doubled up.

1202
01:03:21,856 --> 01:03:23,187
We just can't afford it.

1203
01:03:23,224 --> 01:03:25,192
No, what we can't afford
is for you to collapse,

1204
01:03:25,226 --> 01:03:26,784
okay, because you're trying
to organize

1205
01:03:26,828 --> 01:03:28,523
your daughter's wedding
singlehandedly.

1206
01:03:28,563 --> 01:03:30,861
Just let me do it.
It's done.

1207
01:03:30,899 --> 01:03:32,059
(sighs)

1208
01:03:33,835 --> 01:03:35,132
My prince.

1209
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:37,798
Out of my sight.

1210
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:39,397
One thing.

1211
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:40,499
Don't tell Abu.

1212
01:03:40,542 --> 01:03:42,272
Okay, I won't.

1213
01:03:42,311 --> 01:03:44,472
Okay, talk later.

1214
01:03:44,513 --> 01:03:45,480
Love you, baita.

1215
01:03:45,514 --> 01:03:46,503
Uh-huh.
Okay.

1216
01:03:46,549 --> 01:03:47,538
God be with you.

1217
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:48,641
(camera shutter clicks)

1218
01:03:48,684 --> 01:03:50,174
Hello!
Enough already!

1219
01:03:50,219 --> 01:03:51,550
- Just... just look at me.
- Hello?

1220
01:03:51,587 --> 01:03:53,452
Just look at... okay, fine.
Fine, fine, fine.

1221
01:03:53,489 --> 01:03:54,820
You're unbelievable.
Do you know that?

1222
01:03:54,857 --> 01:03:56,017
I'm worried about my mom here.

1223
01:03:56,058 --> 01:03:58,185
She's going nuts
because of the wedding.

1224
01:03:58,227 --> 01:04:00,422
A wedding gets her closer
to grandchildren.

1225
01:04:00,463 --> 01:04:02,897
That's what she wants, right?

1226
01:04:02,932 --> 01:04:04,092
Yeah, I guess.

1227
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:09,437
I made your mom and dad
something for the wedding.

1228
01:04:12,676 --> 01:04:14,701
(laughs)

1229
01:04:14,745 --> 01:04:16,144
That's why you wanted the photos?

1230
01:04:16,179 --> 01:04:18,374
Your ma is so gorgeous.

1231
01:04:18,415 --> 01:04:20,815
Mm.

1232
01:04:20,851 --> 01:04:22,182
You're gorgeous.
Thank you.

1233
01:04:22,219 --> 01:04:23,243
Mm.

1234
01:04:31,161 --> 01:04:32,651
Do you ever think about kids?

1235
01:04:35,899 --> 01:04:37,423
Um...

1236
01:04:39,469 --> 01:04:40,595
I did before,

1237
01:04:40,637 --> 01:04:42,229
but the world's a little scarier now,

1238
01:04:42,272 --> 01:04:44,172
so I'm not as sure
as I used to be.

1239
01:04:48,613 --> 01:04:50,046
My parents never said it
out loud,

1240
01:04:50,081 --> 01:04:51,605
but I know they want
two things in life.

1241
01:04:51,649 --> 01:04:54,641
They want security
in their old age,

1242
01:04:54,685 --> 01:04:56,983
and they want grandchildren.

1243
01:04:57,021 --> 01:04:59,717
And you want to
give that to them.

1244
01:04:59,757 --> 01:05:01,418
Yeah.
They're my parents.

1245
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,155
You have a sense of filial duty.

1246
01:05:06,531 --> 01:05:08,362
Yeah, I guess
I'm old-fashioned like that.

1247
01:05:10,368 --> 01:05:11,460
It's nice.

1248
01:05:13,604 --> 01:05:15,504
So does that mean
you're persuadable?

1249
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:21,804
I don't know.

1250
01:05:31,957 --> 01:05:32,946
(sighs)

1251
01:05:47,172 --> 01:05:48,663
(yawns)

1252
01:05:48,708 --> 01:05:49,868
(sobs)

1253
01:05:59,285 --> 01:06:00,877
Hey.

1254
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,046
(sniffles)

1255
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:04,522
Erica?

1256
01:06:04,557 --> 01:06:05,649
Hey, what is it?

1257
01:06:05,692 --> 01:06:06,784
What's wrong?

1258
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:12,122
Erica...

1259
01:06:13,299 --> 01:06:14,459
Ah.

1260
01:06:17,003 --> 01:06:18,994
I can't believe I'm talking
about having kids

1261
01:06:19,038 --> 01:06:20,301
with another man.

1262
01:06:24,111 --> 01:06:25,408
Honey, it was just talking.

1263
01:06:25,446 --> 01:06:26,640
It was just fooling around.

1264
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,238
And I'm not another man.

1265
01:06:28,282 --> 01:06:29,579
No, no, no.
No, no.

1266
01:06:29,617 --> 01:06:31,778
You are another man.

1267
01:06:33,954 --> 01:06:34,943
(sobs)

1268
01:06:34,989 --> 01:06:36,149
You are.

1269
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:43,653
(crying)

1270
01:06:48,135 --> 01:06:51,572
Chris... he didn't have any family.

1271
01:06:51,606 --> 01:06:55,064
Not like you.
I was his family, okay?

1272
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:58,273
I was his family,
and I'm forgetting him.

1273
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:03,408
Oh, God.

1274
01:07:03,451 --> 01:07:06,318
You know, I had been...
I'd been drinking,

1275
01:07:06,354 --> 01:07:09,323
and Chris asked me
if I was okay to drive,

1276
01:07:09,357 --> 01:07:10,984
and I said yes.

1277
01:07:14,396 --> 01:07:15,556
I killed him.

1278
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:21,925
(sighs)
Oh, God.

1279
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:23,939

01:15:53,531 --> 01:15:55,795
The house is no fun without you.

1459
01:15:55,834 --> 01:15:57,802
There's no power either.

1460
01:15:57,836 --> 01:16:00,031
(in English) We'll eat
in the dark tonight.

1461
01:16:00,071 --> 01:16:01,936
Thinking of you, baita.

1462
01:16:01,973 --> 01:16:03,634
Abu also.

1463
01:16:03,675 --> 01:16:05,609
(in Urdu) Much love.

1464
01:16:05,643 --> 01:16:07,167
(machine beeps)

1465
01:16:08,179 --> 01:16:09,203
(bottle opener clatters)

1466
01:16:18,056 --> 01:16:19,546
Happy Eid.

1467
01:16:21,726 --> 01:16:24,696
(morose orchestral music)

1468
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:27,198
♪

1469
01:16:27,233 --> 01:16:29,064
Quite a beard.

1470
01:16:29,101 --> 01:16:32,127
That's getting to be some
very serious mullah action.

1471
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:35,407
I want you to get me
two glasses of the crystal...

1472
01:16:35,441 --> 01:16:36,601
(whispering indistinctly)

1473
01:16:42,081 --> 01:16:44,413
So we've got to evaluate
a prestige publisher

1474
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:46,042
in Istanbul for a conglomerate.

1475
01:16:46,085 --> 01:16:47,177
And guess what.

1476
01:16:47,219 --> 01:16:48,846
You are the chosen one.

1477
01:16:48,888 --> 01:16:50,788
Thank you.

1478
01:16:50,823 --> 01:16:52,688
The directors agreed with me.

1479
01:16:52,725 --> 01:16:54,853
We're upping you.

1480
01:16:54,895 --> 01:16:56,089
You are the youngest associate

1481
01:16:56,129 --> 01:16:58,063
in the history of Underwood Samson.

1482
01:16:58,098 --> 01:16:59,190
(glasses clink)

1483
01:17:02,569 --> 01:17:06,369
Although, I do believe
appearances are important.

1484
01:17:06,406 --> 01:17:09,204
Success requires...

1485
01:17:09,242 --> 01:17:11,710
some adjustment
in that department.

1486
01:17:15,015 --> 01:17:17,540
Underwood, Samson,

1487
01:17:17,584 --> 01:17:19,677
and The Mighty Khan.

1488
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:21,186
Oh, no partners.

1489
01:17:21,221 --> 01:17:22,950
Just Khan. I'm a dictator,
remember?

1490
01:17:22,989 --> 01:17:24,013
Mm.

1491
01:17:25,993 --> 01:17:27,460
Motherfucker.

1492
01:17:27,495 --> 01:17:30,020
Next time you want to see me,
call my secretary, okay?

1493
01:17:30,064 --> 01:17:31,224
Up yours.

1494
01:17:42,577 --> 01:17:45,569
(speaking Urdu)

1495
01:17:56,791 --> 01:17:58,259
I'm not going to take
medication!

1496
01:17:58,293 --> 01:17:59,260
911.

1497
01:17:59,294 --> 01:18:00,591
No more medication.

1498
01:18:00,629 --> 01:18:02,494
There's a crazy Arab guy
in midtown Manhattan.

1499
01:18:02,531 --> 01:18:03,828
Long-distance killer!

1500
01:18:03,866 --> 01:18:05,527
Why he get all credit?

1501
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,865
Yeah, 53rd and Lexington.

1502
01:18:07,903 --> 01:18:09,871
Homegrown!

1503
01:18:09,905 --> 01:18:11,338
We are homegrown bombers!

1504
01:18:11,373 --> 01:18:13,170
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- We're homegrown bombers!

1505
01:18:13,208 --> 01:18:15,108
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- We are homegrown bomb...

1506
01:18:15,143 --> 01:18:16,474
Bomb your children!

1507
01:18:16,511 --> 01:18:17,773
You bastard!
Hey!

1508
01:18:17,813 --> 01:18:18,780
He's crazy.

1509
01:18:18,814 --> 01:18:21,009
(shouting indistinctly)

1510
01:18:21,049 --> 01:18:25,281
(police sirens wailing)

1511
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,617
(indistinct radio transmission)

1512
01:18:26,655 --> 01:18:28,452
Hey!
Hold up!

1513
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:30,459
You in the black coat,
stop right there.

1514
01:18:30,493 --> 01:18:31,790
- I didn't do...
- Hands on the car.

1515
01:18:31,828 --> 01:18:33,625
- I didn't do anything.
- Put your hands on the car.

1516
01:18:33,663 --> 01:18:35,187
The guy you're looking for
is back there.

1517
01:18:35,231 --> 01:18:36,391
Yeah, we'll get him.

1518
01:18:36,432 --> 01:18:37,990
- I work on the 53rd floor...
- Hands down.

1519
01:18:38,034 --> 01:18:39,558
Of that building,
Underwood Samson.

1520
01:18:39,602 --> 01:18:41,365
Why don't you just check?

1521
01:18:41,404 --> 01:18:42,928
Why don't you just...

1522
01:18:42,972 --> 01:18:44,462
- Officer, please.
- Spread your legs!

1523
01:18:44,507 --> 01:18:46,737
You got any weapons on you?

1524
01:18:46,776 --> 01:18:48,038
Don't do this, man.

1525
01:18:48,077 --> 01:18:50,602
Ain't doing nothing
but my job, little man.

1526
01:18:50,647 --> 01:18:53,639
(police siren wailing)

1527
01:18:55,852 --> 01:18:57,114
Ow, man!

1528
01:18:57,153 --> 01:18:59,678
Uh-uh!
Get your hands off me!

1529
01:18:59,722 --> 01:19:00,849
Uh!

1530
01:19:04,194 --> 01:19:05,286
Wait right here.

1531
01:19:06,463 --> 01:19:08,021
(door buzzes)

1532
01:19:31,789 --> 01:19:33,382
I'm Special Agent Ford.

1533
01:19:33,425 --> 01:19:34,790
This is Special Agent Jackson.

1534
01:19:34,826 --> 01:19:35,918
This is inexcusable.

1535
01:19:35,961 --> 01:19:37,622
I'd like to see my lawyer, please.

1536
01:19:43,101 --> 01:19:45,160
Are you refusing to talk
to us?

1537
01:19:45,203 --> 01:19:46,670
No, you picked up
the wrong guy,

1538
01:19:46,705 --> 01:19:47,763
and I'm sick of this shit.

1539
01:19:47,806 --> 01:19:50,798
I want to see my lawyer.

1540
01:19:50,842 --> 01:19:52,935
You ever been to the Philippines?

1541
01:19:57,582 --> 01:20:00,142
I work at Underwood Samson.

1542
01:20:00,185 --> 01:20:03,518
I was inspecting a company there
as a financial analyst.

1543
01:20:04,957 --> 01:20:08,449
You ever had any combat
training in Afghanistan?

1544
01:20:12,732 --> 01:20:14,461
Of course I've never had
combat training,

1545
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,764
and I've never set foot
in Afghanistan!

1546
01:20:16,802 --> 01:20:18,030
Don't get upset.

1547
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:19,697
I am upset. I'm upset
about my treatment.

1548
01:20:19,739 --> 01:20:21,070
I'm not a fucking terrorist.

1549
01:20:24,777 --> 01:20:27,712
Have you ever been a member
of a terrorist organization?

1550
01:20:27,747 --> 01:20:29,009
Okay, you know what?

1551
01:20:29,048 --> 01:20:31,346
I'm sick of having to try
and prove a negative,

1552
01:20:31,384 --> 01:20:33,284
so why don't you either
charge me with something

1553
01:20:33,319 --> 01:20:34,809
or let me go?

1554
01:20:40,927 --> 01:20:43,088
How do you feel about the
United States of America?

1555
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:51,697
Agent Ford,

1556
01:20:51,738 --> 01:20:54,400
I love the United States of America.

1557
01:20:58,245 --> 01:21:00,372
Hey, baby, I can't wait to see you

1558
01:21:00,414 --> 01:21:02,006
at my opening tonight.

1559
01:21:02,049 --> 01:21:05,576
And the gallery's on the corner
of Crosby and Prince.

1560
01:21:05,619 --> 01:21:06,950
Okay, I'll see you.

1561
01:21:08,256 --> 01:21:09,848
(police siren wailing)

1562
01:21:09,891 --> 01:21:11,791
Hey, Marina!

1563
01:21:11,826 --> 01:21:13,623
Hi, sugar.

1564
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:16,653
(indistinct conversations)

1565
01:21:23,171 --> 01:21:25,036
I'm alone.

1566
01:21:25,073 --> 01:21:28,600
I'm very, very alone.

1567
01:21:28,643 --> 01:21:31,203
(indistinct recording)

1568
01:21:31,245 --> 01:21:33,008
I want to forget.

1569
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:37,310
Ladies and gentlemen, a reminder:

1570
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:39,286
never accept a parcel or bag

1571
01:21:39,321 --> 01:21:41,687
from a third party
for any reason.

1572
01:21:49,598 --> 01:21:51,259
I want to forget.

1573
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:54,833
Never leave your baggage
unattended.

1574
01:21:56,405 --> 01:21:58,396
- Hors d'oeuvres?
- Oh, no, I'm vegan.

1575
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:01,432
(indistinct conversations)

1576
01:22:03,979 --> 01:22:06,277
I had a Pakistani once...

1577
01:22:14,457 --> 01:22:16,925
I'm glad... I'm glad
you're enjoying it.

1578
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,689
Good to see you.

1579
01:22:18,728 --> 01:22:19,922
- Hi.
- Hi.

1580
01:22:19,963 --> 01:22:21,225
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

1581
01:22:21,264 --> 01:22:22,663
Ah.

1582
01:22:22,699 --> 01:22:25,259
- This is amazing.
- Thank you.

1583
01:22:25,301 --> 01:22:26,768
Changez?

1584
01:22:26,803 --> 01:22:27,963
Changez!

1585
01:22:33,076 --> 01:22:35,874
I'm so happy you're here.

1586
01:22:35,912 --> 01:22:38,642
I don't recognize my
own voice anymore.

1587
01:22:38,681 --> 01:22:39,978
What have you done?

1588
01:22:40,016 --> 01:22:42,383
It's... what do you mean?

1589
01:22:42,419 --> 01:22:43,579
This is us.

1590
01:22:45,122 --> 01:22:46,817
It's about us.

1591
01:22:46,857 --> 01:22:48,188
From you too now?

1592
01:22:50,961 --> 01:22:53,429
You're the one goddamn person
I trusted in this city,

1593
01:22:53,464 --> 01:22:55,762
and now I get this shit,

1594
01:22:55,799 --> 01:22:58,427
this fucking shit
from you too now?

1595
01:23:02,139 --> 01:23:03,265
Hmm?
- I don't...

1596
01:23:03,307 --> 01:23:05,207
I thought... I thought...

1597
01:23:05,242 --> 01:23:06,834
I thought you'd be proud of me.

1598
01:23:06,877 --> 01:23:08,105
- Why would I be proud?
What?

1599
01:23:08,145 --> 01:23:11,137
Proud of being your own
little pet artistic project?

1600
01:23:11,182 --> 01:23:12,513
Can we please take this outside?

1601
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:14,314
- No, what?
Was that the idea?

1602
01:23:14,352 --> 01:23:15,979
Huh?
How chic! How chic!

1603
01:23:16,021 --> 01:23:18,956
"I'm gonna date a Pakistani
after 9/11,

1604
01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:21,220
and it's gonna be great
for my bohemian street cred. "

1605
01:23:21,259 --> 01:23:23,056
Is that the idea?
- That's completely unfair.

1606
01:23:23,094 --> 01:23:26,825
"I fucked the 20th hijacker"?
Huh?

1607
01:23:26,865 --> 01:23:29,857
I'm like the ultimate downtown
status symbol right now.

1608
01:23:31,069 --> 01:23:33,037
Is that it? You're just
gonna walk away?

1609
01:23:33,071 --> 01:23:34,595
That's all you got to say
for yourself?

1610
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:37,767
I mean, are your feelings so pure?

1611
01:23:37,809 --> 01:23:39,242
Would you have
been interested in me

1612
01:23:39,277 --> 01:23:40,710
if my uncle wasn't your CEO

1613
01:23:40,745 --> 01:23:44,613
or if my mother lived in Queens
instead of Park and 85th?

1614
01:23:44,649 --> 01:23:46,447
- Are you kidding me?
You're a sick girl.

1615
01:23:46,485 --> 01:23:47,850
It was never about that for me!

1616
01:23:47,887 --> 01:23:49,047
You might not believe this,

1617
01:23:49,088 --> 01:23:50,885
but that is an expression of love.

1618
01:23:50,923 --> 01:23:53,016
- You know what it is?
That... that is defamation.

1619
01:23:53,059 --> 01:23:54,117
I want it taken down.

1620
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,627
Changez, please.

1621
01:23:57,296 --> 01:23:59,856
Please, just take a breath.

1622
01:23:59,899 --> 01:24:01,526
I can't believe
you're reacting this way.

1623
01:24:01,567 --> 01:24:02,693
How do you want me to react?

1624
01:24:02,735 --> 01:24:03,724
Please take a breath.

1625
01:24:03,769 --> 01:24:04,997
How could you do that?

1626
01:24:05,037 --> 01:24:06,163
Stop attacking me!

1627
01:24:06,205 --> 01:24:07,763
Stop attacking me
for one minute!

1628
01:24:07,807 --> 01:24:09,900
Please stop attacking me!
Please!

1629
01:24:09,942 --> 01:24:12,240
Please stop attacking me!

1630
01:24:12,278 --> 01:24:15,179
You could do it because
you're reckless.

1631
01:24:15,214 --> 01:24:17,877
You're reckless enough
to drive drunk

1632
01:24:17,918 --> 01:24:19,943
with the person
you supposedly love

1633
01:24:19,987 --> 01:24:21,955
