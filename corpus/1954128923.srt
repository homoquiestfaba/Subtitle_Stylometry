Who do you love?

Ow. Ow.

22
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:50,584
...you were sleeping.

your cell phone in the dryer.

You text a lot,

When were you going
to tell me, honey?

I know, okay?

53
00:03:51,772 --> 00:03:53,814
I made some texts,

54
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:55,775
and they're
fucking stupid texts.

55
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,027
Yeah, they're stupid.
Here's one stupid text for you now.

56
00:03:58,028 --> 00:03:59,445
That's a dumb thing to fucking do.

57
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:01,072
I'm going to read this
to you real quick.

58
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:03,616
Last Friday, you text,

59
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:06,327
- "I miss your magic pussy."
- You got to...

60
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:09,121
( laughs )
What's magic about it, honey?

61
00:04:09,122 --> 00:04:10,456

L-- I just don't see Kevin
as the marrying type.

slept with me, honey.

No, but really,
I have this gut feeling

that Kevin
picked this weekend

88
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:22,570
and planned it all out
to propose to me.

89
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,738
Sadie, I...

91
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:28,534
You guys have been
together for, what,

92
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:30,536
less than six months?

93

You really think
you know him that well?

94
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:36,876
Oh, I knew I wanted to marry
Kevin after our first date.

95
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:40,129
He's the one.

96
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,007
When you meet
the love of your life,

97
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:46,802
you'll just know.

98
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:50,890
I guess.

an awful lot.

This is good for me,

183
00:09:41,955 --> 00:09:43,372
'cause I want to do
the lronman next year...

184
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:45,165
- Come on!
- ...and this kind of cardio

185
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,292
is exactly what I need.

186
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:52,293
( Panting )
Trying to kill me.

187
00:09:52,632 --> 00:09:53,799
Whoo!

188
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,467
- All righty.
- I win.

189
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:57,136
I guess since you won,

190
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:58,554
you qualify
for the victory swim.

191
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:02,975
(squeals, laughs )
No!

192
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:07,976
( Bird squawks )

193
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:13,606
( gasps )

194
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:23,116
( laughs )

195
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:28,997
Come and get it!

196
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:34,461
-( laughing )
- What's this?

197
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:40,262
Kevin, do you love me?

198
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:43,098
Of course I love you.

199
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:44,600
Even though I'm crazy?

200
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:48,187
I love you
'cause you're crazy.

201
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:52,649
( Moaning )

202
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:57,650
( Kevin grunting )

203
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:04,286
( thunder crashing )

204
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:05,996
I think we should get out.

205
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:07,623
- No, no, I don't care.
- ( thunder crashes )

206
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:08,874
I don't care.

207
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,542
If lightning
strikes us right now,

208
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:12,711
it'd be God's way of keeping us
together for eternity.

209
00:11:12,712 --> 00:11:14,254
( laughs )

210
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:15,756
Let's live a little longer,
shall we?

211
00:11:15,757 --> 00:11:20,757
( laughing )

212
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:29,269
(thunder continues)

213
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,604
You know what you get,
don't you?

214
00:11:30,605 --> 00:11:32,147
What?

215
00:11:32,148 --> 00:11:33,732
( laughs )
What?

216
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:34,942
What are you doing?

217
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:37,361
- You're the winner.
- Oh, my God.

218
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:41,865
On the behalf of the community,
we'd like to bestow this award upon you.

219
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:43,659
You just came
three minutes ago.

220
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,744
Well, I'm not Superman.

221
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:47,663
Yes, well,
I am your Kryptonite,

222
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:50,541
but I need to go dry
our messy, messy clothes.

223
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:51,708
- Okay?
- Okay,

224
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,920
- Leave me alone for five minutes.
- Yeah, all right. Fine.

225
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:57,840
We'll be right out here.

226
00:11:57,841 --> 00:12:02,841
( Thunder crashes )

227
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:15,061
( thunder rumbles )

228
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:46,263
Kevin,

229
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:49,391
tell me how much
you love me again.

230
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:51,727
Okay, I love you again.

231
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:53,687
I'm serious.

232
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:58,688
You know
how much I love you.

233
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:02,988
Do you think we're going
to grow old together?

234
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:06,241
Sadie, you having
a girl moment right now?

235
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:07,993
Is that what that is?

236
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:09,536
Can you really be happy
having sex

237
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:11,496
with just one woman
for the rest of your life?

238
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:13,999
As long as that one woman
was you, yeah.

239
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,292
For the rest of your life?

240
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:17,794
Starting today, the only pussy
you'll ever have is mine?

241
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:22,795
( laughs )
As long as you're attached to it.

242
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:28,972
So...

243
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:30,849
you'll never cheat on me?

244
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,644
Honey, you're too cute, all right?
Now cut it out, would you?

245
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:35,479
Stop being so serious.

246
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,022
Come over here
and kiss me already.

247
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:38,482
What's a fella got to do?

248
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:41,610
Where are my cigarettes, honey?

249
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:43,862
You give me so much grief
for smoking cigars,

250
00:13:43,863 --> 00:13:47,449
and you smoke that shit?

251
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,826
You know how much I hate
that medication you take.

252
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:51,703
We've had this argument.

253
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:55,499
Yeah, I know,
and for good reason.

254
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,210
Psychs are paid
by pharmaceutical companies

255
00:13:58,211 --> 00:13:59,378
to prescribe that shit.

256
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:04,379
It's a total scam.

257
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,887
I think meds
make people more crazy.

258
00:14:08,888 --> 00:14:10,472
Some people need it.

259
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:13,100
You've never been manic.
You don't understand.

260
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:15,477
If you want me
to get off my meds,

261
00:14:15,478 --> 00:14:17,854
get me pregnant.

262
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,024
I'd stop taking 'em
if I was pregnant.

263
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:23,360
I think we'd have to be
married first for that.

264
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:25,070
( laughs )

265
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:30,071
Is that a proposal?

266
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:35,618
I know what you want.

267
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,459
I'm going to give you
what you really want.

268
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,460
- All right.
- You're gonna love this, baby.

269
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:56,893
You guys like it

270
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:58,061
- when girls are angry...
- Ow.

271
00:14:58,062 --> 00:14:59,855
...and pissed off when they're
giving you head, huh?

272
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:01,481
- Really? Come on now.
- Yeah.

273
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:03,150
- That's how you like it.
- ( winces )

274
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:04,860
- You pervs like it like this.
- All right, that's--

275
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:07,154
- ( spraying )
- Ah, God! ( yelling)

276
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:10,699
God! What the fuck?!
Ah, my eyes.

277
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,701
God damn--
get me some water.

278
00:15:12,702 --> 00:15:16,955
( Yells )

279
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:21,956
No. No water.

280
00:15:29,635 --> 00:15:32,387
What the fuck happened
to my fucking head?

281
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:35,849
You scorned me, Kevin.

282
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,268
Oh, baby, I'm-- I'm sorry.

283
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:40,520
- You took my heart...
- I'm really sorry.

284
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:43,815
...and you--
you broke my heart.

285
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:44,983
I'm sorry, baby.

286
00:15:44,984 --> 00:15:46,735
And you know how much
that was going to hurt me.

287
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:48,862
Um...

288
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:50,864
I knew.
I'm stupid.

289
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:52,240
I'm really sorry.
I was just--

290
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:53,784
You know what?
You know what?

291
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,702
(shushes)

292
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:56,953
I love you.

293
00:15:56,954 --> 00:16:00,707
( laughs )
I love you.

294
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,001
Do you know what I was going
to tell you this weekend?

295
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:04,169
What?

296
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,754
This weekend,
I was going to tell you

297
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:08,632
that we're going to have a baby.

298
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:11,301
I took a pregnancy test last week.
( laughs )

299
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:15,138
I am growing an innocent little baby
right here in my tummy.

300
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:16,932
And you know
I could never abort a baby.

301
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:18,183
I could never harm an innocent life.

302
00:16:18,184 --> 00:16:19,768
- I'm going to be sick.
- You know that, right?

303
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:22,521
- That's why I...
- All right.

304
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:26,775
...I stopped taking
my lithium-- for you.

305
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:28,401
- For you and the baby.
- I didn't know you were pregnant.

306
00:16:28,402 --> 00:16:31,029
That's right, 'cause you only cheat
on girls who aren't pregnant.

307
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,031
That's right.
You are such an ethical man.

308
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:35,200
I knew you had character, honey.

309
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:38,203
I knew you had character.

310
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:41,206
- Um...
- Go ahead, apologize.

311
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:42,374
Tell me you're sorry.

312
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:46,711
Tell me what a big
fucking mistake you made.

313
00:16:46,712 --> 00:16:49,131
I'm sorry.
That was a big mistake.

314
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:52,717
Yes, it was.
But you know what?

315
00:16:52,718 --> 00:16:54,386
- I can fix it.
- Yeah.

316
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:57,597
I sent Jennifer a text message
from your phone.

317
00:16:57,598 --> 00:16:59,891
You told her we broke up

318
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:02,894
and I had a friend
come and pick me up

319
00:17:02,895 --> 00:17:05,647
and you have the house
for the rest of the weekend.

320
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:07,858
And she was so excited
about that.

321
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,067
( Cell phone chimes )

322
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:10,527
Oh. Hold on.

323
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:12,487
Hold on.
You just got a message.

324
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:13,697
It's from Jennifer.

325
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,824
I'll read it to you word for word.

326
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:19,411
"I can leave tonight after work."

327
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:22,289
Then she wrote an X and an O

328
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,624
and an X and an O,
et cetera.

329
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,252
Those are hugs and kisses.
I think she really likes you, honey.

330
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:31,047
- I really do.
- ( thunder crashes )

331
00:17:31,048 --> 00:17:33,800
- ( cell phone chimes)
- Oh. Another message from Jennifer.

332
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:36,052
- "L can't wait to see you, Kevin."
- Come on.

333
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:39,764
"PS, I'm going 2 B wearing
something extra naughty."

334
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:43,185
Whoo! My goodness.
You two are frisky.

335
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:45,103
You promised me a weekend.

336
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:47,063
We're just going
to have a friend join us.

337
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:50,734
Remember that time when you asked me
if I would be willing to do a threesome?

338
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:53,486
That's the thing
about threesomes, of course.

339
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,323
You got to do it all together.
You can't do it separately.

340
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:58,617
- Fuck! (grunts)
- Ooh.

341
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:00,744
I got to learn how to tie ropes
a little better.

342
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:02,454
- You fucking...
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

343
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:04,331
Okay. You know what?
You know what?

344
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:05,540
Come here. Come here.

345
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,751
You're going to take this whole
damn bottle right now.

346
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:09,461
- Right now.
-(gags)

347
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:11,671
Okay. Okay.

348
00:18:11,672 --> 00:18:14,591
(sobs)

349
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:16,301
Fuck!

350
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:17,636
Oh, my fucking head.

351
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:19,596
- Oh, my fucking head.
- Yeah.

352
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:24,597
I'm about to bash your head in again
if you don't calm down.

353
00:18:25,436 --> 00:18:28,605
Okay. Oh.

354
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:30,732
Okay.
(shushes)

355
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:32,525
It's okay.

356
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:36,321
- It's okay.
-( Kevin murmuring)

357
00:18:36,322 --> 00:18:40,533
I really think I should get you
a cigar or something.

358
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:44,412
(thunder continues)

359
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:44,454
He loves me.

360
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:46,957
He loves me.

361
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:50,502
He loves me not.

362
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:53,421
He loves me.

363
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:57,550
He loves me not.

364
00:18:57,551 --> 00:19:00,262
He loves me.

365
00:19:00,263 --> 00:19:05,263
He loves me not.
Honey, this is going to be so romantic.

366
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:08,395
Ooh.
( laughs )

367
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:09,896
Now, honey,
you shouldn't be drinking.

368
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:12,607
Just“

369
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:13,817
it's not good for you.

370
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:16,820
You shouldn't be drinking, smoking.

371
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:18,780
There's a baby in you now.

372
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:20,865
Baby, my mama
drank and smoked

373
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:25,662
all through my pregnancy,
and I turned out all right.

374
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:26,830
Want some more Vicodin?

375
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:28,498
Oh, no, no, no,
"0,"0,no,no,no.

376
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:29,666
(murmurs)

377
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:32,127
Here's one right here for later
and one right here for now.

378
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:34,713
Hey, no! Ow.

379
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:36,506
There we go.
That's better.

380
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:38,758
Please, you got to stop.

381
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:41,803
You need to stop asking me that.

382
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:43,555
Look at how supportive I'm being.

383
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:47,642
I set up the candles.
I got the flower petals here.

384
00:19:47,643 --> 00:19:49,853
I swear to God, you men never
appreciate anything women do for you.

385
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:52,272
- ( Thunder crashes )
- He loves me.

386
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:54,399
He loves me not.

387
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,568
He loves me.
He loves me not.

388
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:58,570
I certainly hope
I end on "He loves me"!

389
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:03,571
( laughing )
Me too.

"Follow the rose petals."

393
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:21,092
Hmm.

394
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:26,093
"Follow the rose petals," Bootsie.

395
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:46,493
Go to sleep here, little Bootsie.

396
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:49,371
( Whimpers )

397
00:20:49,372 --> 00:20:53,833
Mama's got a hot date.

398
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:57,962
Don't mind if I do.

399
00:20:57,963 --> 00:21:02,963

400
00:21:04,678 --> 00:21:09,678

404
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:26,862
Shit.

405
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:30,995
Baby?

406
00:21:30,996 --> 00:21:35,996
Your naughty little puppy is here.

409
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:54,936
Hello, sexy.

410
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:57,397
Mmm.

411
00:21:57,398 --> 00:21:59,566
( Muffled )
Take the gag off.

Take the gag off.

414

No.
( muffled speech )

415
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,785
Take the gag off of me.

416
00:22:10,786 --> 00:22:13,455

- Kevin, you're such a freak.

( muffled )
Don't use the handcuffs.

419
00:22:18,377 --> 00:22:19,836
You don't need
to use the handcuffs.

( Thunder crashes )

423
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:29,304
You're a cheater, Jennifer,

424
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:30,889
just like Kevin.

425
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,892
Sadie, this is crazy.

426
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:35,643
Yeah, it is.

427
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:37,604
We were friends.

428
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:39,731
You were going to be my fricking
maid of honor, for Christ's sake.

429
00:22:39,732 --> 00:22:41,232
I know.

430
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:45,320
I know, but we can talk
about this, right?

431
00:22:45,321 --> 00:22:48,698
No.

432
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:50,617
I'm really sorry, Sadie.

433
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:54,204
I know how this must look.

434
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:59,205
Sadie, there's something important
you need to know.

435
00:23:02,546 --> 00:23:05,173
I'm sure there is,

436
00:23:05,174 --> 00:23:08,593
but I don't want to hear
anything from you right now.

437
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:11,638
Kevin likes his women clean.

438
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:14,682
Don't you, Kevin?

439
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:19,270
Oh, I prescribed him some medicine.
He probably passed out again.

440
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:24,271
Sadie, what are you doing?

441
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:27,487
Hey! Hey!

442
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,863
Hey! Hey!

443
00:23:28,864 --> 00:23:31,282
Come here.

444
00:23:31,283 --> 00:23:35,537
You know what they used to do
to cheaters in the medieval days?

445
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:37,789
For one, they used
to cut off their hair.

446
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,749
- No. No.
- You hold still,

447
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,251
or I'll pop your fucking eye out.

448
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:46,252
- Please don't.
- I have to.

449
00:23:58,143 --> 00:23:59,394
Please stop.

450
00:23:59,395 --> 00:24:02,522
( Scissors snipping )

451

Sadie.

452
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:10,154
I want to explain everything to you.

453
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:15,155
It should have been you
in that hospital, not me.

454
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:24,707
Please.

455
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:28,965

456

Kevin, she's all ready for you.

457

Isn't she pretty, Kevin?

458
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:41,603
You got to let us go.
This is--

459
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:42,895
this is crazy.

460
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:45,231
As crazy as you two
loving behind my back?

461
00:24:45,232 --> 00:24:46,691
( laughs )

462
00:24:46,692 --> 00:24:49,694
I'm trying to make you feel better.

463
00:24:49,695 --> 00:24:52,280
No more guilt, no hiding.

464
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:54,407
I'm going to watch.

465
00:24:54,408 --> 00:24:57,702
That way, neither of you are doing
anything behind my back anymore.

466
00:24:57,703 --> 00:24:59,704
It's all out in the open,

467
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:02,707
no lies, no deceit.

468
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:05,710
Don't you two feel cleaner now?

469
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:08,588
Sadie, we don't want to do this.

470
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:11,591
You don't have a say in this, Jen.

471
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:14,344
Did I have a say when you started

472
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:18,139
loving my boyfriend
behind my back?

473
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,684
You are a...

to dry off her poodle
in the microwave?

'( Barks )

487
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:15,947
She should have read the instructions,
but women never do.

For Christ's sake, Sadie,
this is a little dog.

489

You can't do this.

490

I think 10 minutes should suffice.

00:28:47,683 --> 00:28:50,351
You like 'em, Jennifer?

536
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:54,105
Mm-hmm.

537
00:28:54,106 --> 00:28:55,857
Well, speak up, honey.
I can't hear you.

538
00:28:55,858 --> 00:28:57,608
I said yes.

539
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:59,944
These tacos are good.
Okay, Sadie?

540
00:28:59,945 --> 00:29:01,112
You goddamn psycho!

541
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:02,780
- Shh.
- Can you hear me now?!

542
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:04,866
Your tacos are fucking great,

543
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:06,868
you crazy, fucking bitch.

544
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:08,202
Did you understand that?

545
00:29:08,203 --> 00:29:10,705
You need to relax.

546
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:13,583
I'll relax when you stop
this shit and let us go.

547
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:15,877
And can I have my fucking
clothes back, please?

548
00:29:15,878 --> 00:29:17,044
Shh. No, no, no.

549
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:19,213
- What the fuck are you doing, Kevin?
- Don't make her angry.

550
00:29:19,214 --> 00:29:20,381
What the fuck is wrong with you?

551
00:29:20,382 --> 00:29:21,591
- Listen.
- Huh?

552
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:23,259
Don't piss her off.
It's a fucking game.

553
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,969
All right, calm down.
Let's just enjoy a nice dinner.

554
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,263
( laughs )
Let's get back to the tacos.

555
00:29:27,264 --> 00:29:30,308
You know, I use a lot of spices.
I make 'em real spicy.

556
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:32,310
If you use a meat
that's not the best,

557
00:29:32,311 --> 00:29:36,147
covers it up real well.

558
00:29:36,148 --> 00:29:37,982
You want some more guacamole
on your tacos?

559
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:39,400
No. I'm fine.

560
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:40,902
Here we go.
Come here.

561
00:29:40,903 --> 00:29:44,155
I love guacamole.

562
00:29:44,156 --> 00:29:45,990
Sadie, this is fucked up.

563
00:29:45,991 --> 00:29:50,119
Eat it.

564
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,080
Right.

565
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:54,582
You know what I was just thinking?

566
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:57,251
I should start a taco stand.

567
00:29:57,252 --> 00:29:59,378
( laughs )
That's what I should do.

568
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:00,922
I'd have to think
of a real good name for it,

569
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:04,592
something catchy.

570
00:30:04,593 --> 00:30:09,055
Bootsie's Taco Stand.

571
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:11,641
By the way, Jennifer,
have you seen Bootsie?

572
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:14,518
I haven't seen that little doggy
since I started making dinner.

573
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,687
Bootsie!

574
00:30:16,688 --> 00:30:18,397
Bootsie.

575
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:20,942
Where are you, little doggy?

576
00:30:20,943 --> 00:30:22,818
Bootsie.

577
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:26,781
Bootsie, where are you, honey?

578
00:30:26,782 --> 00:30:29,492
( laughs )

579
00:30:29,493 --> 00:30:30,660
( Bootsie barks )

580
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:32,828
Oh, there he is.

581
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:34,705
Come here, doggy.

582
00:30:34,706 --> 00:30:36,958
There's the little guy.

583
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:40,378
Mwah.
( laughs )

584
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:41,712
Oh.

585
00:30:41,713 --> 00:30:44,674
Did you guys spit out your food?

586
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:46,968
I spent an awful lot of time
working on this dinner

587
00:30:46,969 --> 00:30:51,969
for you guys to spit it out.

588
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:58,225
Aw, now, how could you think
I'd cook up little Bootsie here?

589
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,397
Huh?

590
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:01,357
I'm not some kind of animal.

591
00:31:01,358 --> 00:31:03,401
( laughs )

592
00:31:03,402 --> 00:31:06,612
How fucking long
is this going to go on, okay?

593
00:31:06,613 --> 00:31:11,534
As long as it needs to.

594
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:15,371
I told you, Kevin, you scorned me.

595
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:18,708
You too, Jen.

596
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:21,168
This little dog,
on the other hand,

597
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:24,130
didn't do nothing to me.

598
00:31:24,131 --> 00:31:26,298
He's a good puppy.

599
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:28,009
There you go.

600
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:33,010
There you go. Oh.

601
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:38,978
Dispatcher over radio:
All units be advised, we had an escape

602
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:41,105
from the correctional facility
in Logan County.

603
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:44,859
Suspect believed to be dangerous,
heading north.

604
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,070
( Police radio chatter)

605
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:49,739
Man over radio:
Five on the way.

606
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,450
Dispatch, we've got no sign
of escapee,

607
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:55,286
and we've covered
two miles south of 105.

608
00:31:55,287 --> 00:32:00,287
( Radio chatter continues )

609
00:32:02,127 --> 00:32:07,127
(thunder rumbling )

610
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:13,759
( metal creaking )

611
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:15,431
Now wake up, Kevin.

612
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:17,725
I want both of you to hear this.

613
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:21,562
Look what I found.

614
00:32:21,563 --> 00:32:26,563
All kinds of stuff in this house.

615
00:32:30,822 --> 00:32:35,822
Going to tell you guys a story
about when I was in the hospital.

616
00:32:37,662 --> 00:32:40,081
They thought I was sick.

617
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:44,085
They wanted to cure me.

618
00:32:44,086 --> 00:32:47,588
They explained to me that...

619
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:49,799
to change one's behavior,

620
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,719
you must change
their thinking pattern first.

621
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,554
( laughs )

622
00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:58,474
They said that...

623
00:32:58,475 --> 00:33:01,727
electricity was good for that.

624
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:03,854
They said it would cure me.

625
00:33:03,855 --> 00:33:06,232
I don't know about that.

626
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:09,360
After their shocks, I'd just...

627
00:33:09,361 --> 00:33:13,489
get so mad.

628
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,742
Mostly I'd just stare out the window,

629
00:33:16,743 --> 00:33:21,163
sometimes for hours.

630
00:33:21,164 --> 00:33:24,750
If I really misbehaved,
they'd take me into this room,

631
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:28,087
and they'd give me shock
after shock after shock.

632
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:33,088
There was a certain point,
I guess I just stopped misbehaving.

633
00:33:33,718 --> 00:33:35,219
I don't know if I was cured,

634
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,972
but I certainly didn't feel
like doing the things

635
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:42,973
that made 'em give me
the shocks.

636
00:33:43,103 --> 00:33:46,564
You two have misbehaved.

637
00:33:46,565 --> 00:33:47,731
( Thunder crashes )

638
00:33:47,732 --> 00:33:50,901
You need to be cured
of wanting to fuck each other.

639
00:33:50,902 --> 00:33:52,695
All you need is...

640
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:53,863
a little electricity.

641
00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:56,949
- ( Kevin speaking, muffled )
- Oh, shit.

642
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,202
I forgot.

643
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:05,203
Could bite your tongue clean off
if you don't have protection.

644
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,877
Sadie, please let us go.

645
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:09,670
Shh now.

646
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:11,755
- ( Muffled speech )
- Shh!

647
00:34:11,756 --> 00:34:13,507
It's all right.

648
00:34:13,508 --> 00:34:16,302
( Muffled )
Come on, you just--

649
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:17,636
please, you don't need to--

650
00:34:17,637 --> 00:34:18,804
- Shh.
- come on.

651
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:21,265
- ( Muffled speech )
- Okay.

652
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:24,476
- ( Cell phone chimes )
- What's that?

653
00:34:24,477 --> 00:34:27,605
Oh, baby, you got a text.

654
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:30,107
It's from your mother.
( laughs )

655
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:32,776
Awful timing.

656
00:34:32,777 --> 00:34:36,739
She's asking how we're enjoying
our weekend at the house.

657
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,949
I will respond for you.

658
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:43,579
"Sadie n I are having
an awesome time.

659
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,789
By the way,

660
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,959
are u still sucking Dad's dick?"

661
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,961
-( laughs )
- ( muffled speech )

662
00:34:50,962 --> 00:34:53,005
- I put a little happy face.
- ( muffled speech )

663
00:34:53,006 --> 00:34:55,090
Oh, Kevin, honey, come on.

664
00:34:55,091 --> 00:34:57,092
You never did have
a sense of humor.

665
00:34:57,093 --> 00:35:02,093
-( Buzzing )
- ( muffled yelling )

666
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:25,120
You fucking cunt!

667
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:27,998
You did all this because of
a fucking stupid affair?

668
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:29,166
It was nothing!

669
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:32,503
( Muffled grunting )

670
00:35:32,504 --> 00:35:35,673
Jesus, Kevin, you're so hostile.

671
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:37,132
I'm just trying to help you.

672
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:39,843
Think of me as your doctor.

673
00:35:39,844 --> 00:35:41,971
Oh, honey...

674
00:35:41,972 --> 00:35:43,514
you peed your pants.

675
00:35:43,515 --> 00:35:44,974
It's okay.
It happens.

676
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:46,433
Well, how do you feel, Kevin?

677
00:35:46,434 --> 00:35:49,019
Do you feel like sticking your dick
into Jennifer anymore?

678
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,187
Let us go.

679
00:35:50,188 --> 00:35:52,273
Oh, sure, yeah, honey.
I'll get right on that.

680
00:35:52,274 --> 00:35:55,859
Would you like me to call
911 too while I'm at it?

681
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,321
I was in the hospital till I was 18.

682
00:35:59,322 --> 00:36:01,365
I think you two
are getting off pretty easy.

683
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:03,367
Hasn't this gone on
for long enough?

684
00:36:03,368 --> 00:36:08,368
What more are you going
to do to us?

685
00:36:08,456 --> 00:36:09,832
I don't know, Jennifer.

686
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,209
- ( Thunder rumbling )
- I'm a girl.

687
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:17,210
I don't read the instructions.
I'm just kind of winging it here.

688
00:36:17,716 --> 00:36:19,717
Ugh.
( sputtering )

689
00:36:19,718 --> 00:36:20,884
What the hell?

690
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:22,720
How do you fucking smoke
these things, baby?

691
00:36:22,721 --> 00:36:24,096
They taste like shit.

692
00:36:24,097 --> 00:36:25,889
( Doorbell rings )

693
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,641
Jeez.
Who the fuck is that?

694
00:36:27,642 --> 00:36:29,435
( Kevin spits )

695
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:33,897
Help! Help!
We're out here by the--

696
00:36:33,898 --> 00:36:35,190
You two don't go anywhere.

697
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:36,525
Have a cigar.

698
00:36:36,526 --> 00:36:37,860
- ( Sizzles )
- ( muffled screaming )

699
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:40,529
Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

700
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,614
( Doorbell ringing )

701
00:36:42,615 --> 00:36:44,450
( muffled sobs )

702
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:44,491
( doorbell rings )

703
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:46,285
( doorbell rings )

704
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:50,748
( thunder crashing )

705
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:51,957
Hi there.

706
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,459
Is Kevin here?

707
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,879
I mean, I saw his car.

708
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,631
Yes. Actually, he...

709
00:36:59,632 --> 00:37:01,425
is in the shower.

710
00:37:01,426 --> 00:37:03,344
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

711
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:05,179
I live next door.
I'm Rita.

712
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,348
I'm Sadie.

713
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:08,849
Nice to meet you.

714
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,601
- I'm Kevin's girlfriend.
- Oh.

715
00:37:10,602 --> 00:37:12,770
Actually, his fiancee.

716
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:14,146
- ( Chuckles )
- It's a secret.

717
00:37:14,147 --> 00:37:15,814
Shh. Don't tell anyone.

718
00:37:15,815 --> 00:37:17,941
Dear, I don't want
to bother you two.

719
00:37:17,942 --> 00:37:20,069
I just want to leave
some of my chili.

720
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,947
It's been Kevin's favorite
since he was a kid.

721
00:37:23,948 --> 00:37:26,325
- Has it, now?
- Yeah.

722
00:37:26,326 --> 00:37:29,620
Well, how did you know
that chili is my favorite?

723
00:37:29,621 --> 00:37:31,288
( laughs )

724
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:32,748
Kevin!

725
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:35,793
Rita just came over
and brought us some chili!

726
00:37:35,794 --> 00:37:38,087
Why don't you come in
and have some with us?

727
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:41,423
Oh, dear, I've already
butted in too much already.

728
00:37:41,424 --> 00:37:46,424
No, no, no.
Rita, I insist.

729
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,597
( Thunder crashing )

730
00:37:48,598 --> 00:37:50,891
- ( whimpering )
- Sadie: Bootsie!

731
00:37:50,892 --> 00:37:52,142
Bootsie!

732
00:37:52,143 --> 00:37:57,143
- Oh.
- Bootsie!

733
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,193
Dispatcher over radio:
All units, suspect last seen

734
00:38:01,194 --> 00:38:05,614
heading north of 415
toward Hilltop Road.

735
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:06,824
That's a copy, dispatch.

736
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:08,826
We've got units covering
the whole county.

737
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:11,078
We've also got
the state police assisting.

738
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:16,079
( Police radio chatter)

739
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:28,220
Why do dogs like to find
the muddiest puddles?

740
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:33,221
I swear they're just like men.

741
00:38:38,189 --> 00:38:40,274
Oh, I don't know
what I would have done

742
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:42,109
if Bootsie got away.

743
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,694
He's never been to this house.

744
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:45,863
Oh.
( laughs )

745
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:50,864
You run along now.

746
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:03,714
I have a gun in my bedside table.

747
00:39:03,715 --> 00:39:04,965
I'm swing to go get it.

748
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:06,675
Meant nothing?

749
00:39:06,676 --> 00:39:07,843
( Sighs )
Baby--

750
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:11,346
Just shut up and get the gun.

751
00:39:11,347 --> 00:39:13,599
I love onions in my chili.

752
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,894
Won't you please stay
and have some with us?

753
00:39:16,895 --> 00:39:19,855
Listen, dear, I still remember
what it was like

754
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:22,274
when I was a young girl.
( chuckles )

755
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:26,236
You two don't need
an old coot like me around.

756
00:39:26,237 --> 00:39:27,821
Tell Kevin I said hi.

757
00:39:27,822 --> 00:39:32,822
Mm.

758
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:45,380
Looking for this?

759
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:46,924
All right, just...

760
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:49,760
Honey, you told me the gun
was in the drawer, remember?

761
00:39:49,761 --> 00:39:51,929
Just put the fucking gun
down, okay?

762
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,639
- This has gone far enough.
- No, it hasn't.

763
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,350
-( Hammer clicks )
- Just come on! Just stop it!

764
00:39:56,351 --> 00:40:01,351
Kevin, get back downstairs.

765
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:23,919
Cumbersome motherfucker.

766
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,420
Damn.

767
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:28,674
I'll never see him again.

768
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:31,718
I promise you that, Sadie.

769
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:36,719
I have to teach you
to try not to escape.

770
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:40,102
No.

771
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:43,105
For God's sake...

772
00:40:43,106 --> 00:40:45,190
Don't you know there is no God?

773
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:46,900
Or else why would He let me
do this to you?

774
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:48,235
No, please.

775
00:40:48,236 --> 00:40:49,653
- Hey!
- Don't.

776
00:40:49,654 --> 00:40:51,363
- Hey!
- No. No.

777
00:40:51,364 --> 00:40:53,824
- Please!
- Don't fight it, cheater.

778
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:56,118
I have to punish you
so that you learn

779
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:01,119
not to loosen your fingers
like Kevin did.

780
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:03,292
Come on, Sadie, look at me.

781
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:05,544
It's me, Jen,

782
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:08,338
your best friend
since second grade.

783
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:12,384
I've learned my lesson,
I swear to God.

784
00:41:12,385 --> 00:41:14,052
I told you.

785
00:41:14,053 --> 00:41:16,221
There is no God.

786
00:41:16,222 --> 00:41:19,349
- That's why I have to do this to you.
- ( metal squeaks )

787
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,810
You've lost your mind.

788
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:26,811
I don't see you in you anymore.

789
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,404
I don't know you.

790
00:41:32,405 --> 00:41:37,200
You know, you're right, Jen.

791
00:41:37,201 --> 00:41:42,201
Yeah, we're friends.

792
00:41:42,415 --> 00:41:43,874
We were friends!

793
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:48,875
-( Bones cracking )
- ( screaming )

794
00:41:54,093 --> 00:41:56,094
Ah, no.

795
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:57,554
( Thunder crashing )

796
00:41:57,555 --> 00:41:59,723
( screams )

797
00:41:59,724 --> 00:42:04,724
( panting )

798
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:12,417
( sighs )

799
00:43:12,797 --> 00:43:12,838
( scraping, thudding )

800
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:17,839
( scraping, thudding )

801
00:43:24,976 --> 00:43:27,394
Kevin: How can you
fucking do that to her?

802
00:43:27,395 --> 00:43:29,312
Did you want to say something?

803
00:43:29,313 --> 00:43:32,816
How can you do that to her?

804
00:43:32,817 --> 00:43:35,318
Well, she's passed out now.
She doesn't feel anything.

805
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:39,656
You seem awfully
protective of her.

806
00:43:39,657 --> 00:43:41,074
I'm going to fucking kill you.

807
00:43:41,075 --> 00:43:44,494
( laughs ) That's no way to talk
to the mother of your child.

808
00:43:44,495 --> 00:43:48,999
No, I'm going to see to it
that you don't run away again.

809
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,584
( Hammer scraping )

810
00:43:50,585 --> 00:43:54,379
Do you remember
our favorite movie, baby?

811
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,047
You got it on DVD.

812
00:43:56,048 --> 00:43:59,801
Oh, we saw a lot of movies, Sadie.

813
00:43:59,802 --> 00:44:04,802
Oh, I think it'll come to you.

814
00:44:05,683 --> 00:44:10,683
Kathy Bates was very good in it.

815
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:20,530
"Misery."

816
00:44:20,531 --> 00:44:25,327
What's the scene
that everybody remembers?

817
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:26,828
No.

818
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:29,247
- You-- you can't do that.
- ( grunts )

819
00:44:29,248 --> 00:44:32,250
- It just creeped everybody out.
- No.

820
00:44:32,251 --> 00:44:34,961
I think they called it hobbling.

821
00:44:34,962 --> 00:44:36,755
No.

822
00:44:36,756 --> 00:44:38,757
Okay.

823
00:44:38,758 --> 00:44:40,550
You can't do this.

824
00:44:40,551 --> 00:44:42,594
What I can't do

825
00:44:42,595 --> 00:44:45,180
is have my man

826
00:44:45,181 --> 00:44:47,140
try to run away from me again.

827
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:50,852
That's what I can't do.

828
00:44:50,853 --> 00:44:52,229
- No.
- I'm sorry, honey.

829
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,564
This is-- this is going to hurt.

830
00:44:54,565 --> 00:44:56,066
( laughing )
You're not going to...

831
00:44:56,067 --> 00:44:58,902
I'm sorry.

832
00:44:58,903 --> 00:45:00,445
( Sadie yells )

833
00:45:00,446 --> 00:45:02,072
Fuck!

834
00:45:02,073 --> 00:45:05,742
( Kevin gasps, Yells )

835
00:45:05,743 --> 00:45:07,327
( yells )

836
00:45:07,328 --> 00:45:09,788
- Jesus, fuck.
- Oh!

837
00:45:09,789 --> 00:45:10,956
Sadie:
I'm sorry, baby.

838
00:45:10,957 --> 00:45:13,458
- ( Sobbing, gasping )
- I'm sorry, Kevin.

839
00:45:13,459 --> 00:45:16,211
I don't think I could break
the other one.

840
00:45:16,212 --> 00:45:20,715
How the hell did she break
both of them in the movie?

841
00:45:20,716 --> 00:45:22,259
I feel like I'm going to be sick.

842
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,636
( Screaming )

843
00:45:24,637 --> 00:45:29,637
( scream echoes )

844
00:45:49,287 --> 00:45:50,453
Sadie:
Hey.

845
00:45:50,454 --> 00:45:55,454
Been asleep for almost an hour.

846
00:45:56,794 --> 00:45:59,796
( Groans )

847
00:45:59,797 --> 00:46:01,506
Where is Kevin?

848
00:46:01,507 --> 00:46:03,300
He's upstairs.

849
00:46:03,301 --> 00:46:07,470
I felt really, really bad
after I crushed his ankle.

850
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:09,848
I wrapped it and gave him
some Vicodin.

851
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:11,391
He's totally knocked out.

852
00:46:11,392 --> 00:46:13,560
( Pills rattling )

853
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:15,854
Will you please let me go?

854
00:46:15,855 --> 00:46:18,064
No.

855
00:46:18,065 --> 00:46:20,191
You should take some of these.

856
00:46:20,192 --> 00:46:23,028
I don't want to.

857
00:46:23,029 --> 00:46:27,032
The pain in my hand
is just numb now.

858
00:46:27,033 --> 00:46:29,367
Not for your hand.

859
00:46:29,368 --> 00:46:33,371
Trust me.
You're going to want 'em.

860
00:46:33,372 --> 00:46:35,373
Here. Here.

861
00:46:35,374 --> 00:46:36,875
Drink, drink, drink.

862
00:46:36,876 --> 00:46:41,876
(thunder rumbling )

863
00:46:43,257 --> 00:46:45,884
When does this finish?

864
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:49,554
When I'm finished.

865
00:46:49,555 --> 00:46:51,765
Did I...

866
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:55,602
ever tell you the story
about when my sister

867
00:46:55,603 --> 00:46:59,439
took my little puppy's love
away from me?

868
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,526
What are you talking about?

869
00:47:03,527 --> 00:47:07,238
I had just turned 11.

870
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:12,239
My dad bought me
the cutest little puppy.

871
00:47:14,246 --> 00:47:16,539
My little sister

872
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:19,209
played with it...

873
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:22,671
and pet it...

874
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:27,467
until that little puppy started
to love her more than it loved me.

875
00:47:27,468 --> 00:47:30,512
Maybe it didn't love her more.

876
00:47:30,513 --> 00:47:32,097
Maybe you just thought that.

877
00:47:32,098 --> 00:47:35,350
That's not true.

878
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:36,810
One night,
I went in her room,

879
00:47:36,811 --> 00:47:41,811
and that little puppy was sleeping,
curled up on her bed.

880
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:45,944
I told you I killed that puppy.

881
00:47:45,945 --> 00:47:49,823
- That's why you went to the hospital.
- No.

882
00:47:49,824 --> 00:47:52,784
I didn't kill the puppy.

883
00:47:52,785 --> 00:47:55,412
You didn't?

884
00:47:55,413 --> 00:47:57,706
No.

885
00:47:57,707 --> 00:48:00,458
See, I couldn't blame
my little puppy.

886
00:48:00,459 --> 00:48:02,335
It wasn't his fault.

887
00:48:02,336 --> 00:48:06,923
He didn't know no better.

888
00:48:06,924 --> 00:48:10,260
It was my sister's fault.

889
00:48:10,261 --> 00:48:12,470
So the next day,

890
00:48:12,471 --> 00:48:17,471
she had a little accident in the pool.

891
00:48:19,812 --> 00:48:21,688
I helped her drown.

892
00:48:21,689 --> 00:48:24,232
You told me you tried to save her.

893
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:27,652
I told everyone that.

894
00:48:27,653 --> 00:48:32,653
It wasn't true, Jen.

895
00:48:35,536 --> 00:48:39,039
What I didn't tell you is that
the police didn't believe me.

896
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,582
I was too young to go to jail,

897
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:45,583
so, you know, they could
only keep me till I was 18.

898
00:48:45,588 --> 00:48:50,467
Listen, I've been thinking...

899
00:48:50,468 --> 00:48:55,468
Kevin is a lot
like my little puppy was.

900
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,349
I can't really blame him,
you know?

901
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:01,311
You and me, we always said
that men are like dogs.

902
00:49:01,312 --> 00:49:03,396
Someone just smiles at 'em,

903
00:49:03,397 --> 00:49:08,026
they'll jump up
and sleep in their bed.

904
00:49:08,027 --> 00:49:11,071
You...

905
00:49:11,072 --> 00:49:16,072
are beautiful, Jennifer.

906
00:49:17,745 --> 00:49:22,745
You have the most beautiful smile.

907
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:30,211
(sobs)

908
00:49:32,009 --> 00:49:36,221
Maybe if my sister...

909
00:49:36,222 --> 00:49:40,725
wasn't so pretty, my little puppy
would have stayed with me.

910
00:49:40,726 --> 00:49:43,728
You're beautiful, Sadie.

911
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:45,522

912

That's not true.

want your number first.

914

916

917

I'm just going to chip one of 'em.

918
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,121

920
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:05,083
Yeah. It'll work better
if you hold still.

921
00:50:05,084 --> 00:50:06,251
Hey!

922
00:50:06,252 --> 00:50:08,169
Hold still.
It'll go easier.

923
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,712
Just stop struggling.

924
00:50:09,713 --> 00:50:11,506
I'm not going
to pull out your tooth.

925

Kevin, you're never
getting out of here.

958

You're all mine.

959
00:53:01,927 --> 00:53:04,137
Hmm.

960
00:53:04,138 --> 00:53:07,390
Do you like my dress?

961
00:53:07,391 --> 00:53:09,309
You think it's pretty on me?

962
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:12,770
I brought it up here
to surprise you this weekend.

963
00:53:12,771 --> 00:53:17,525
Now I want you
to take a good look.

964

Get this picture
of my sexy panties in your mind.

965

What are you going
to do with that?

966
00:53:36,462 --> 00:53:41,462
Baby, I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

967
00:53:42,092 --> 00:53:45,553
It wasn't your fault.

968

with Jennifer.

969

She was cute and sexy.

970

And once you laid
your eyes on her,

971
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,191
it was impossible
for you to resist.

972
00:53:58,192 --> 00:54:00,526
But I have a way

973
00:54:00,527 --> 00:54:04,155
to make that never happen
for us again.

974

You have wandering eyes, Kevin,

975
00:54:07,284 --> 00:54:11,162
and that's not good
for our relationship, baby.

976
00:54:11,163 --> 00:54:13,164

977
00:54:13,165 --> 00:54:14,791

I learned my lesson.

- Just be quiet now.

01:17:37,777 --> 01:17:39,736
He's dead.

1253
01:17:39,737 --> 01:17:40,904
Uh...

1254
01:17:40,905 --> 01:17:43,239
I managed to find
a revolver in the house

1255
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,241
and-- and shoot him.

1256
01:17:45,242 --> 01:17:48,411
Operator:
Okay. Just stay calm.

1257
01:17:48,412 --> 01:17:51,873
I'm hurt really badly.
Please send-- please send someone.

1258
01:17:51,874 --> 01:17:53,416
Operator:
Just stay with me, honey.

1259
01:17:53,417 --> 01:17:56,419
I've got the paramedics
and police on the way.

1260
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:58,087
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1261
01:17:58,088 --> 01:18:03,088
Fuck.

1262
01:18:10,643 --> 01:18:15,643
( Police radio chatter)

1263
01:18:26,784 --> 01:18:28,827
I have to ask you
a few questions, sweetheart.

1264
01:18:28,828 --> 01:18:32,622
It's very important.
Are you allergic to any medicines?

1265
01:18:32,623 --> 01:18:35,375
Okay, because of your injuries,
I have to ask you.

1266
01:18:35,376 --> 01:18:38,962
Are you pregnant?

1267
01:18:38,963 --> 01:18:41,464
No, I'm not pregnant.

1268
01:18:41,465 --> 01:18:43,800
Man: Okay, we're going to get you
to the hospital as quick as we can.

1269
01:18:43,801 --> 01:18:46,553
- Doctors are waiting.
- Thank you.

1270
01:18:46,554 --> 01:18:48,137
- Officer: Found this dog.
- ( barking )

1271
01:18:48,138 --> 01:18:49,806
Poor thing was hiding
in the back room.

1272
01:18:49,807 --> 01:18:52,934
Bootsie!
There you are, sweetie.

1273
01:18:52,935 --> 01:18:55,103
I'm so glad that man
didn't hurt you.

1274
01:18:55,104 --> 01:18:57,355
- ( Growls)
- Oh.

1275
01:18:57,356 --> 01:18:59,190
Oh, you must still be scared.

1276
01:18:59,191 --> 01:19:00,692
That's okay, baby.
Mama's here.

1277
01:19:00,693 --> 01:19:02,777
- Mama's here. I love you.
- ( barks )

1278

We'll take the dog.
We'll take good care of her.

1279
01:19:05,239 --> 01:19:10,239
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1280
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,831
And, Sheriff...

1281
01:19:14,832 --> 01:19:19,832
I just wanted to ask you
a question.

1282
01:19:20,254 --> 01:19:23,172
Was he the man
who escaped from prison?

1283
01:19:23,173 --> 01:19:26,092
Yeah, we think it was.

1284
01:19:26,093 --> 01:19:28,303
You were very brave
to do what you did.

1285
01:19:28,304 --> 01:19:30,471
You saved your life.

1286
01:19:30,472 --> 01:19:34,851
Yeah, I just wish I could
have saved my boyfriend.

1287
01:19:34,852 --> 01:19:39,439
You made it.
You'll be okay now.

1288
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:43,192
Yeah.

1289
01:19:43,193 --> 01:19:48,193
I think I will.

1290
01:19:59,585 --> 01:20:01,294
- ( Siren blaring )
- I'll never get it.

1291
01:20:01,295 --> 01:20:03,463
Longer I'm on the job,

1292
01:20:03,464 --> 01:20:05,506
the more it baffles me.

1293
01:20:05,507 --> 01:20:07,675
I just hope that poor girl--

1294
01:20:07,676 --> 01:20:12,676
she can get through all this.

1295
01:20:18,395 --> 01:20:20,188

1301
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:40,917
Oh, and you, too, Bootsie.

1302
01:20:40,918 --> 01:20:43,044
-( laughs )
- Can I get you anything?

1303
01:20:43,045 --> 01:20:48,045
I'll have an iced tea, please.

1304
01:20:49,635 --> 01:20:51,344
Nice ass.

1305
01:20:51,345 --> 01:20:53,763
Sadie, you're the most
beautiful girl in the world.

1306
01:20:53,764 --> 01:20:56,391
The whole wide world
and parts of the universe, too?

- Most parts.

I love you, Sadie.

01:21:00,187 --> 01:21:03,231
You do?

1310
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,108
So you'd never cheat on me?

1311
01:21:05,109 --> 01:21:07,235
A guy would have to be crazy
to even look at another woman

1312
01:21:07,236 --> 01:21:08,778
when he's got a girl
as great as you.

1313
01:21:08,779 --> 01:21:11,531
I suppose you're right.
( laughs )

1314
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:13,408
Besides,
if you cheated on me,

1315
01:21:13,409 --> 01:21:17,954
I'd have to kill you.
