00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:51,185
Cost you a thousand
for the bond.

159
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:53,880
I can do that.

160
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:56,217
Who's it for?
A relative?

161
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:58,691
A fellow named Beaumont.
They got him down in County.

162
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:02,093
Started out drunk driving,
but they wrote it up
as possession of a concealed weapon.

163
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:05,997
- Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
- Ten thousand sounds high.

164
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:08,901
<i>They run his name, got a hit.</i>
<i>He been inside.</i>

165
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:11,495
Plus, he from Kentucky, and I think
they're kind of prejudiced...

166
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:14,575
against brothers
from down South out here.

167
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:17,941
If he runs, and I have to go
to Kentucky to bring him back,

168
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:19,946
you pay the expenses.

169
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:22,278
You think you can do that?

170
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:26,114
I've done it.
What's his full name?

171
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:28,984
Beaumont.
That's all I know.

172
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:34,721
Would you say that Beaumont
is his first or his last name?

173
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,459
Uh, if I had to guess,
I'd say Beaumont's his Christian name.

174
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:41,798
- [Ringing]
- Records office.

175
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:46,702
Hello, this is Max Cherry,
Cherry Bail Bonds. Who's this, please?

176
00:13:46,808 --> 00:13:49,641
- Ordell, I'm gonna wait in the car.
- <i>Hi, Vicki.</i>

177
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,737
All right, man. Cool.
We're almost done here, right?

178
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:55,646
- Gettin' there.
- Yo, yo.

179
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,653
You check out some music while you're
sitting in the car. Take the keys.

180
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,918
- Which one's for the car?
- Uh, this one right here.

181
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:06,516
Use that little black thing to turn off
the alarm and unlock the door.

182
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:08,858
- What do I do?
- You ain't gotta do nothing, man.

183
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:11,524
Just point it at the car, push the
button, you hear a little "ooh-ooh-ooh."

184
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,900
- That means the door's unlocked
and the alarm's off. Get in.
- Okay.

185
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:18,768
Play the volume loud as you want to,
but don't touch my levels now.

186
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:21,308
- I got them set just like I like 'em.
- <i>Okay.</i>

187
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,916
[Three Beeps]

188
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:35,119
Beaumont Livingston.

189
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:37,282
Livingston, huh?
[Chuckling]

190
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:41,863
<i>On his prior, he served nine months.</i>
<i>He's working on four years'probation.</i>

191
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:45,160
- You don't say.
- <i>You know what he's on probation for?</i>

192
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:49,863
- Ain't got a clue.
- Possession of unregistered
machine guns.

193
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:54,203
<i>Damn. Now, they're gonna consider</i>
<i>that a violation ofhis probation?</i>

194
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:57,745
They do consider this
a violation of his probation.

195
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:00,474
- <i>Your boy's looking at ten years,</i>
- Mm.

196
00:15:00,582 --> 00:15:02,641
<i>Plus the concealed weapon.</i>

197
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:08,086
He ain't gonna like that. Beaumont ain't
got a doing-time kind of disposition.

198
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:12,917
- I need your name and address.
- Ordell Robbie.

199
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:15,053
O-R-D-E-L-L...

200
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:17,256
R-O-B-B-l-E.

201
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:19,892
1436 Florence Boulevard,

202
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:23,528
Compton, 90222.

203
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:29,007
- Is that a house or an apartment?
- That's a house.

204
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:36,582
- [Buzzing]
- Who the fuck is this?

205
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:39,778
It's your benefactor, nigger.
I'm comin' up.

206
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:42,481
Come on up, nigger.
It's open.

207
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:44,888
My pleasure of living...

208
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:48,485
demands that I have
a good-looking woman,
that I'm with a good-looking woman.

209
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:51,361
<i>I couldn't go out with a woman</i>
<i>old enough to be my wife.</i>

210
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:54,459
- O.D.!
- Ah-ha-ha!

211
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:57,538
- Look at you and your free ass.
- What's up, man?

212
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,800
Come here, boy.
Give me a motherfuckin' hug.

213
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:02,968
- I didn't know you were coming by.
- [Laughs] Yeah.

214
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:04,978
My nigger.

215
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,776
Good lookin' out, man. I don't know
what to say. Thank you, thank you.

216
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,477
- Uh-huh. Who was there
for your ass, huh?
- You was there.

217
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:12,519
- Who? Who? Who?
- You. You, nigger. You.

218
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:15,419
You goddamn right. See?
That's how that shit works.

219
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:17,958
You get your ass in trouble,
I get your ass out.

220
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:23,429
That's my motherfucking job.
And I don't mind telling you,
nigger, it's steady work.

221
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:26,990
Hey, look here, man, I'm still scared
as a motherfucker, O.D.

222
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,968
They talkin' like they
serious as hell...

223
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,970
givin' me time for
that machine gun shit.

224
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:33,506
Oh, come on, man. They're just
trying to put a fright in your ass.

225
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,508
If that's what they're doin',
they done did it.

226
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,273
- How old is that machine gun shit, huh?
- About three years.

227
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:41,941
Three years? Come on, man,
that's a old crime, man.

228
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,985
They ain't got room in the joint
for all these niggers out here
killing people now.

229
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:46,986
How they gonna
find room for you?

230
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:48,988
That ain't what
they're telling me.

231
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,117
That's why they call it
"fuckin' with you." Now, let me
tell you how we're going to retaliate.

232
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:57,164
All right? Tomorrow I'm gonna pick
you up, take you over to Century City,

233
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:59,132
introduce you
to my lawyer.

234
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:03,728
Let me tell you
something about my lawyer.
This brother's name is Stacin Goins.

235
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:05,738
This nigger
is a junkyard dog.

236
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,206
He my own personal
Johnny Cochran.

237
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,710
Matter of fact,
he kicked Johnny Cochran's ass.

238
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:14,304
And likeJohnny Cochran,
this nigger hate cops. I'm serious, man.

239
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,976
He live to fuck
with the police.

240
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:20,019
Now, as a favor,
I had him look at your case.

241
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:23,579
He say you ain't got shit to
worry about. They just fuckin' with you.

242
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:29,595
So we're gonna sic
the junkyard dog on their ass
and make 'em stop fuckin' with you.

243
00:17:29,698 --> 00:17:31,859
- Good lookin' out, man.
Good lookin' out.
- Hmm? Mm-hmm.

244
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:34,663
- Come on in, man, and let's celebrate.
- No, no. Uh-uh.

245
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:37,169
Look here, I'm really
supposed to be somewhere.

246
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:41,208
Matter of fact, I was kind of hoping
you could come run with me.

247
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:43,209
What you mean?

248
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:45,211
You know, man,

249
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:48,214
I hate to be the kind of nigger
that do a nigger a favor,

250
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:50,614
then bam... hit the nigger up
for a favor in return,

251
00:17:50,752 --> 00:17:52,720
but I gots to be
that kind of nigger.

252
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:56,153
- What? What you want?
- I need a favor, nigger.

253
00:17:56,257 --> 00:17:59,158
- That requires me to go out tonight?
- Just a bit.

254
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,058
Aw, man, I wasn't plannin'
on goin' no place tonight.

255
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:05,758
It is late as hell, man.
I'm home, I'm high, man. Come on.

256
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,394
Uh-huh.
And why are you home, huh?

257
00:18:08,503 --> 00:18:12,803
You home because I spent $10,000
to get your ass home.

258
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:16,809
Now, look, I got a little problem,
all right?

259
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:19,311
I need some help,
and you can help me out.

260
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:21,905
Go in the house and throw some shit on.
Let's walk out to the car.

261
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,917
Come on.

262
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:29,188
I'm ready, man. What's your problem?
There ain't no problem.

263
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,190
It's more like
a situation.

264
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:35,558
You remember them three
M-60 machine guns I sold
last year outta the five I got?

265
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:38,497
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm gonna sell
the other two tonight.

266
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:43,128
There's this group of Koreans
over in Koreatown startin' this
little Neighborhood Watch thing.

267
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:47,436
They need some weapons so they
can show the neighborhood niggers
they mean business.

268
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:51,501
Now, I'm gonna sell them the other
two machine guns, all right?

269
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:54,912
The problem is, I ain't never done
business with these Koreans before.

270
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:57,951
I ain't worried, 'cause by and large
Asians are very dependable.

271
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,953
They don't want no trouble.

272
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,114
You might argue with them
about price and shit,

273
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:04,657
but you ain't gotta worry about
them shootin' you in the back.

274
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,659
But I got me a rule:

275
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:10,663
Never do business with people
you ain't never done business
with before without backup.

276
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,292
That's why I need you.
Backup.

277
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:18,395
Look, all you've got to do is lay in
here and hold on to this motherfucker.

278
00:19:18,506 --> 00:19:21,873
All right? I'm gonna tell 'em I'm goin'
in the trunk to show 'em the goods.

279
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:24,877
When I open the trunk, you pop up
and rack this motherfucker.

280
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:26,879
Man, fuck that shit.
I ain't for shootin' nobody.

281
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:28,881
I ain't said nothin'
about you shootin' nobody.

282
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:31,474
All you gotta do is hold on to it.
They'll get the idea.

283
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:35,055
You must be out of your mind
if you think I'm gonna get
in this dirty-ass trunk.

284
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,351
We ain't goin' nowhere
but to Koreatown, man.

285
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:39,518
You ain't gonna be in here
no more than ten minutes.

286
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:43,358
I ain't ridin' in
no trunk for no minute.
Why can't I ride up front with you?

287
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:46,366
You can't ride up front with me.
The surprise element is 90% of it.

288
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:49,892
I'm sorry, man, but I ain't
gettin' in no goddamn trunk.

289
00:19:50,004 --> 00:19:52,666
- I can't believe you'd do me like this.
- Do you like what, man?

290
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:56,175
I just ain't climbing in no goddamn,
dirty-ass trunk, man.

291
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:58,177
I got a problem
with small places.

292
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,339
I got a problem with spending
$10,000 on ungrateful niggers
to get them out of jail,

293
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:03,349
but I did it.

294
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:05,385
How small was that
jail cell, motherfucker?

295
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:08,718
- I know I owe you,
you got to bring all this up.
- Then get your ass in this trunk.

296
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:12,919
I want to help you, but I won't be
locked in no goddamn trunk of no car.

297
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:15,928
You think I wanted to spend
$10,000 on your ass, huh?

298
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,726
- I know you helped me out.
- Do you think I wanted to spend
$10,000 on your ass?

299
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,200
- Yes or no?
- Of course you didn't,
but look, in the trunk?

300
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:24,465
That's the only way I could help you,
right? So that's what I did.

301
00:20:24,572 --> 00:20:28,133
Now, look, man, all I'm asking
you to do is get in the trunk,

302
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:31,371
hold this fuckin' shotgun,
point it at these Buddha-heads
when I open it, all right?

303
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:35,381
- You're catching a nigger
off-guard with this shit.
- Look here. I tell you what.

304
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:37,747
When we get through fucking
with these Koreans,

305
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:41,322
me and you go to Roscoe's
Chicken and Waffles on me.

306
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:43,356
Think about it now.

307
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,427
That 'Scoe's Special,
smothered in gravy and onions,

308
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:50,122
side of red beans and rice,

468
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:03,934
Jackie, you have
a good lawyer?

469
00:31:04,044 --> 00:31:06,535
<i>[Dargas] Can she afford</i>
<i>a good one, is more like it.</i>

470
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:08,945
<i>Otherwise you'll be</i>
<i>in Sybil Brand three weeks...</i>

471
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:12,780
before the public defender
gets around to ya.

472
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:18,654
- <i>[Siren Wails]</i>
- Hey, Jackie, do you know a guy
named Beaumont Livingston?

473
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:21,853
Yeah? No?

474
00:31:21,962 --> 00:31:24,362
- <i>[Pours Coffee]</i>
- Because he knows you.

475
00:31:24,432 --> 00:31:26,400
Well, he knew you.

476
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,128
He doesn't know anybody now.
He's dead.

477
00:31:29,236 --> 00:31:32,296
They found him in a trunk
of a car this morning,

478
00:31:32,406 --> 00:31:34,533
shot twice.

479
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:38,339
Once in the chest,
once in the head.

480
00:31:38,446 --> 00:31:40,812
Here you go.
So I guess I'm wondering.

481
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:43,315
If you don't know Beaumont,

482
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,822
why do you suppose Beaumont
knows you?

483
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:57,562
<i>[Clears Throat] Look, Miss Brown,</i>
<i>we don't give a fuck about you.</i>

484
00:31:57,631 --> 00:31:59,531
You know who we want.

485
00:31:59,633 --> 00:32:03,364
If you cooperate, tell us what we want
to know, we'll help you get out of this.

486
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:07,430
If you refuse to cooperate,
continue to cop a shit attitude
like you're doing now,

487
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:10,533
<i>we</i> will <i>give you to Customs</i>
<i>and they</i> will <i>take you to court.</i>

488
00:32:10,644 --> 00:32:13,135
<i>With your prior, thejudge</i>
will <i>give you two years.</i>

489
00:32:13,247 --> 00:32:16,774
Now, you'll probably only end up
serving a year and some change,

490
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:19,818
but if I was
a 44-year-old black woman...

491
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,380
desperately clinging on to this
one shitty, little job I was
fortunate enough to get,

492
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:27,460
I don't think that I'd think
I had a year to throw away.

493
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:31,088
<i>So let's start again now,</i>
<i>shall we?</i>

494
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:35,568
<i>Who in Mexico gave you this money, and</i>
<i>who in America were you bringing it to?</i>

495
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:39,298
I'm not sayin'
another goddamn word.

496
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:45,437
[Clears Throat]

497
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:50,779
I'd like your permission
to look through this again so
we'll know how much we're talking about.

498
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:53,614
Sure. Go ahead.

499
00:32:56,657 --> 00:32:59,626
<i>While we're at it,</i>
<i>let's see what else is in there.</i>

500

<i>Do you mind?</i>

501
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:07,195
Beauty case.

502
00:33:07,301 --> 00:33:09,963
- <i>Mm-hmm. What's in it?</i>
- Beauty products.

503
00:33:11,338 --> 00:33:13,966

- <i>[Dargas] What's that?</i>
- My diet shit.

507
00:33:25,386 --> 00:33:27,786
<i>Let's see what else</i>
<i>is in there.</i>

508
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,622
Here. Here. Here.

509
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,228
- What's this?
- What's that shit?

510

<i>The charge is...</i>

possession of narcotics
with the intent to distribute.

521
00:34:18,372 --> 00:34:22,570
- How does your client plead?
- Uh, Your Honor,
she wishes to stand mute.

522
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:24,576
<i>Very well.</i>

<i>Detective... Varga.</i>

- Dargas, Your Honor.
- <i>Sorry.</i>

525
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,911
Uh, you were the arresting officer
in this case?

526
00:34:33,053 --> 00:34:35,988
- That's correct, Your Honor.
- <i>And do you have a bail recommendation?</i>

527
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,524
- Yes, I do, Your Honor.
- And that would be?

528
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:41,254
<i>Based on the defendant's</i>
<i>prior conviction...</i>

529

545
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:52,925
- Comfortable?
- Yeah.

546
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:57,231
- Door was open, so I just come on in.
- I can see that.

547
00:35:57,337 --> 00:35:59,498
- Why?
- Got some more business for you.

548
00:35:59,606 --> 00:36:01,699
Oh, yeah?
What did he do?

549
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:04,505
<i>She</i> is an airline stewardess.

550
00:36:04,611 --> 00:36:07,341
Got caught coming back
from Mexico with some blow.

551
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:10,417
They set her bond
this afternoon at $10,000.

552
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:15,011
Now, I'm figuring you could take
that $10,000 you owe me from Beaumont,

553
00:36:15,155 --> 00:36:17,055
move it over
to the stewardess.

554
00:36:17,157 --> 00:36:20,217
- The bond for possession's
only a thousand.
- Hmm. Yeah.

555
00:36:20,327 --> 00:36:24,559
Man, they fuckin' with her. They callin'
that shit "possession with intent."

556
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:27,794
A 44-year-old black woman
caught with less than two ounces,

557
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:29,801
they calling that shit "intent."

558
00:36:29,903 --> 00:36:33,669
The same thing happen to a movie star,
they call it "possession."

559
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,674
Still sounds high.

560
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:40,941
Well, um, she had on her,
I believe it was 50 grand in cash.

561
00:36:41,048 --> 00:36:44,313
All right, before we start
talking about stewardesses,

562
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:46,612
let's get Beaumont
out of the way first.

563
00:36:46,754 --> 00:36:48,847
You know, I think
somebody already did.

564
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:51,423
- What?
- You ain't hear?

565
00:36:51,558 --> 00:36:55,426
- Hear what?
- Somebody with a grudge
blew Beaumont's brains out.

566
00:36:55,529 --> 00:36:58,430
Oh, shit.
That shit rhymes.

567
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:00,490
Blew Beaumont's
brains out.

568
00:37:02,236 --> 00:37:04,568
Police make contact
with you?

569
00:37:04,671 --> 00:37:08,163
Oh, hell, yeah.
First motherfucking thing they did.

570
00:37:08,275 --> 00:37:10,835
You know, they see I pay
a big money bond for my boy,

571
00:37:10,944 --> 00:37:13,845
they start thinking that "where there's
smoke there's fire" logic.

572
00:37:13,947 --> 00:37:16,575
Rousted my ass out of bed
10:00 in the morning.

573
00:37:16,683 --> 00:37:18,844
Scared the shit out
of my woman Sheronda.

574
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,887
She thought they was gonna
take my ass away for sure.

575
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,481
- This stewardess...
You know her last name?
- Mm-hmm.

576
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:29,323
Brown.
Jackie Brown.

577
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:31,897
- What does she do for you?
- Who said she do anything for me?

578
00:37:31,965 --> 00:37:35,492
She's my friend. My friends get
in trouble, I like to help them out.

579
00:37:35,602 --> 00:37:37,593
Beaumont worked for you.

580
00:37:37,704 --> 00:37:41,140
This you and me talking,
like lawyer-client thing?

581
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:43,141
You can't tell nothing
I say to you?

582
00:37:43,243 --> 00:37:46,679
You're not my client till you
get busted and I bond you out.

583
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,012
Well, we ain't got no, uh...
What you call that shit?

584
00:37:51,151 --> 00:37:53,051
Confidentiality.

585
00:37:53,153 --> 00:37:55,053
Why should I
tell you anything?

586
00:37:55,155 --> 00:37:57,521
'Cause you want me to know
what a slick guy you are.

587
00:37:57,624 --> 00:37:59,956
You got stewardesses
bringing you 50 grand.

588
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,291
And why would a stewardess
be bringing me 50 grand?

589
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:06,798
Now you want me to speculate
on what you do.

590
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:11,395
I'd say you were in the drug business,
except the money's moving
in the wrong direction.

591
00:38:11,505 --> 00:38:16,374
Whatever you're into, you seem
to be getting away with it,
so, uh, more power to you.

592
00:38:16,476 --> 00:38:19,070
All right.
You want another bond?

593
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:21,841
You want to move the 10,000 you got
on Beaumont over to the stewardess.

594
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:23,849
That means paperwork.

595
00:38:23,951 --> 00:38:26,442
I gotta get a death certificate,
present it to the court,

596
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:30,023
make out a receipt for
return of bond collateral,
I type up another application,

597
00:38:30,157 --> 00:38:32,148
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Another indemnity agreement.

598
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:34,556
- I haven't got time.
- I'm telling you what I have to do.

599
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:36,561
What you have to do,
in case you forgot,

600
00:38:36,663 --> 00:38:39,826
- is come up with a premium
of a thousand bucks.
- I can do that.

601
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,801
You know I got the money.
I just ain't got it with me.

602
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,394
Come back when you do.
I'll bond out the stewardess.

603
00:38:45,505 --> 00:38:49,464
Look, you got to look at this
with a little compassion, all right?

604
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:52,704
Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't
used to this kind of treatment.

605
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:55,646
Gangsters don't give a fuck,
but your average citizen,

606
00:38:55,749 --> 00:38:58,684
a couple of nights in County
get to fuckin' with their mind.

607
00:38:58,785 --> 00:39:01,083
Ordell, this isn't a bar.
You don't have a tab.

608
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:03,213
Listen to me, all right?

609
00:39:03,357 --> 00:39:07,760
You got a 44-year-old, gainfully
employed black woman falsely accused...

610
00:39:07,895 --> 00:39:11,524
Falsely accused? She didn't come
back from Mexico with cocaine on her?

611
00:39:11,598 --> 00:39:13,964
Falsely accused
of"intent."

612
00:39:14,067 --> 00:39:17,400
If she had that shit...
and mind you, I'm saying <i>if</i>...

613
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,029
that was her own personal shit
to get high with.

614
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,667
Is white guilt supposed to make me
forget I'm running a business?

615
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:29,013
Oh, it's like that, huh?

616
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:35,821
All right.

617
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,551
I got your little
thousand bucks.

618
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,864
- Hey, Candy.
- Hey, Max.

619

that I must have written about...

678
00:44:28,782 --> 00:44:32,343
15,000 bonds since
I've been in the business.

679

if I cooperate,

682
00:44:45,765 --> 00:44:49,326
then I'll get probation,
maybe.

683
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:52,928
Or if I stand mute,
I can get as much as five years.

Does that sound right?

685
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:59,211

and convict you, you won't get
more than a year and a day.

want to do that.

a couple of months of county time...

689

- No, let's be realistic.

get around to offering me a plea deal,

a lot of money.

all in Cabo, and more coming in.

- He came by.

- What'd you do?
- We talked.

Do you think
he still trusts you?

He had his doubts at first,
but he's always trusted me.

00:57:13,279 --> 00:57:17,113

anything else that he still can.

- Why?
- <i>Because he needs my ass.</i>

I mean, he might try to...
bring the money in himself,

00:57:39,538 --> 00:57:42,006
but he ain't gonna wanna
stand in no customs lines.

like he still can.
