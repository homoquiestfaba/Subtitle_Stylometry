1
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,609
- Get in here
captain coke dealer,

2
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,045
you're gonna give us both up.

3
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,615
- Sorry, man.

4
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:49,216
Just wanted to make sure

5
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,718
you weren't some kind
of cop or something.

6
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:52,554
- Do I look like a cop?

7
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,124
- It's all good,
what you need man?

8
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,558
- I need the hardest
stuff you got.

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,727
- You do, huh?

10
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:02,462
Let me see some money.

11
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,532
- I just saw you sling a
whole bag to that crackhead.

12
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:05,934
Now show me what you got.

13
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:07,635
- How much you want?

14
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:08,536
- All of it.

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,441
- That's all I got man,

16
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,310
better have the money.

17
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,947
- So concerned with the
money, I got your money.

18
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:26,955
So here's the deal.

19
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:29,724
We can do this the easy
way or the hard way,

20
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,661
you can either go down
for possession and intent,

21
00:01:33,828 --> 00:01:35,495
or you could write down the name

22
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:36,396
of your supplier right here

23
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,831
and I'm gonna go after the
bigger fish, your choice.

24
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:42,837
You got three
seconds, three, two.

25
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,644
Have a nice jog loser.

26
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,185
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

27
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,685
What did you do with it Shannon?

28
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,087
- Didn't do nothing.

29
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:02,420
- You're lying to me,
you are lying to me.

30
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,990
I had four bags of that stuff.

31
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:05,758
What did the drug fairy fly
in here and take off with it.

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,929
- You probably used
it all yourself.

33
00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:11,099
- Your pupils are
as big as quarters.

34
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,598
How much did you use?

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,601
How much, I was gonna sell
that to pay bills Shannon.

36
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,603
You have no idea what
I had to go through

37
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,607
to get that, I could
have been shot.

38
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:21,941
You want me dead Shannon?

39
00:02:21,943 --> 00:02:24,444
You want me dead,
you want me dead?

40
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,952
You call the cops,
I'm gonna kill you.

41
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,621
- Don't you take my car.

42
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:57,645
- What happened
to your neck, bro?

43
00:02:57,779 --> 00:02:59,444
- What do you think
happened to my neck?

44
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,115
Shannon stole my stuff again.

45
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:02,548
- What?

46
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,516
- Yeah.

47
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:04,717
- That's just wrong.

48
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,383
- Yep.

49
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,852
- Did you call the cops?

50
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:07,687
- No.

51
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:08,386
- And so what's the description

52
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,390
of that stolen vehicle again?

53
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,392
- I think she did though.

54
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,566
Yep.

55
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:21,869
Hold on.

56
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,306
- They bow him out with two.

57
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,175
- Clear.

58
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,484
- Come on, man, get up.

59
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:11,517
- On your knees now.

60
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,520
Now, get down.

61
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:14,522
Get down onto your knees,
hands on your head.

62
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,354
- Sorry man.

63
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,525
- Hey, hey, hey.

64
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:27,367
- Excuse me, ma'am,

65
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,605
do you mind if I use your
phone just for a minute?

66
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:31,873
Oh no, it's okay.

67
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,941
I just wreck my car, I just.

68
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,543
- I don't think so.

69
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,476
- Dude, I need you
to come pick me up

70
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,611
at your grandma's
house right now.

71
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:13,712
- What,
what are you doing

72
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:14,713
at my grandma's house?

73
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:15,781
Is she home?

74
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:16,784
- No, she's not home.

75
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,984
Look, I had a ditch Shannon's
car, Harley got arrested.

76
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,152
The cops are everywhere.

77
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,289
I need you to come
pick me up right now.

78
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,466
Thanks for getting me, man.

79
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:34,802
- Yeah, man, no worries.

80
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,171
Are you you sure it's safe
to come back here so soon?

81
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:38,838
- Oh yeah, the lights are out.

82
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,741
So she's either in
bed or she's split.

83
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:42,810
Actually, I hope she's gone.

84
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,677
She uses too much
of my stash anyway.

85
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,147
- Yeah, you don't want that.

86
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,013
- I'll see you tomorrow.

87
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:48,647
- All right man.

88
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:49,515
- Later, stay safe.

89
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:50,417
- Yep.

90
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:20,447
- Morning sunshine.

91
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:24,884
- You see what you
get for hitting me.

92
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,919
You see what you get.

93
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:31,624
You stole my car and got it
impounded, big man now, huh?

94
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:33,460
- Get him in the car.

95
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,630
- He's got weed
in the house too.

96
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,807
- Mr. Highberger,
you're back again.

97
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,642
- He's racking up the
frequent flyer miles.

98
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:50,945
- Put him in D2.

99
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,397
- You do know the rules, right?

100
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:11,799
You resist to hand
you a whooping.

101
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,536
- I know my rule, never
go without a fight.

102
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:17,736
I gave as good as I got.

103
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,507
- Yeah, maybe,

104
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,507
but I don't see them
sitting on this bench

105
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:22,810
with a fancy bracelet on,

106
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,712
but I will give
you credit though.

107
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,715
It took about four of them
to drag you up in here.

108
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:32,586
- It's not even my
best number, man, six.

109
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:36,257
- Six, impressive.

110
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,424
- I was younger.

111
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:41,162
- Yeah, weren't we
all the first time in.

112
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,167
- I was 16 I think.

113
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:00,748
- That looks like our boy.

114
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,849
- Battery to a police officer,

115
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:07,353
resisting arrest, disorderly
conduct, minor in possession.

116
00:08:07,355 --> 00:08:09,355
Possession of a
controlled substance.

117
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:11,859
Possession of drug
paraphernalia.

118
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,560
- Oh, why can't kids
go to the bowling alley

119
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:16,562
to actually bowl?

120
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:18,931
- It looks like
the owner was cited

121
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,600
for serving alcohol to a minor.

122
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:24,436
- Good, any other churches
for our esteemed client?

123
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,705
- That's not enough
for you counselor.

124
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,942
I've got his entire
criminal history right here

125
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:33,579
if you have a few hours, first
brush with the law was at 12,

126
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:37,182
stole his mom's car and burnt
up the engine and a pursuit.

127
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:40,853
- Be a public defender they
said, it'll be fun they said.

128
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,721
- That's the same thing
they said to social workers.

129
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:45,626
So his risk assessment
is way above 12.

130
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,730
So he'll be staying in the
padded cell until his hearing.

131
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,197
They say he is an
irrefutable danger

132
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,400
to himself and to others.

133
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:55,634
- Don't suppose it
will do any good

134
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:56,602
to request the judge
remand him to mom

135
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:58,370
and dad in the interim?

136
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,738
- Don't want him,
mom and stepdad say

137
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,473
he's too much to handle.

138
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:02,708
And he says he doesn't wanna
be bothered with them either.

139
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,979
So that's why I'm here.

140
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,779
- What about bio dad.

141
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:09,116
- Florida, not much contact.

142
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:12,453
- Okay, let's have
them bring him in.

143
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,827
- I ain't got nothing to say.

144
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:23,664
- Relax kid, we're on your side.

145
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:24,832
- You my lawyer?

146
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,834
- Kyle Devidy, court
appointed counsel,

147
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:30,335
looks like you've
had a busy night,

148
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:33,639
drinking, drugging, fighting.

149
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,407
You're off to a
flying start kid.

150
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,645
- We're here to help you Scott.

151
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,480
- Nobody can help me.

152
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:41,682
- Well, we can
try if you let us.

153
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:45,184
- I think the judge
will reduce the felony

154
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:47,853
to a misdemeanor if we.

155
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:49,254
- Just plead guilty
and send me to jail.

156
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,325
- You want to go to jail?

157
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:52,527
- Beats going home.

158
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:57,696
From that day on,

159
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:58,931
I never backed down from a fight

160
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,868
and I never pled not guilty.

161
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:06,040
I was always like to the police

162
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:10,545
and the courts and
just whoever, bring it.

163
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:12,514
You're not gonna break me.

164
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:14,516
- Winning, right?

165
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,551
- I guess so.

166
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:20,454
- And like I said before,
yet you are the one

167
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:22,389
sitting on this bench
with a fancy bracelet.

168
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,557
And those guys you just showed

169
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,391
are heading home to a good meal

170
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,028
and night sleep
in their own bed.

171
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:34,201
Well, I'm just making a pit
stop on my way to the pen

172
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:38,372
and by the looks of things,
you're not too far behind,

173
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,141
I'll save you a bunk kid.

174
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:54,388
- You want to
plead guilty Scott?

175
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,490
- Might as well, if I get out,

176
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:57,890
they're just gonna
find another reason

177
00:10:57,892 --> 00:10:58,759
to stick me back in here.

178
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,396
- Pleading guilty can have
very serious ramifications,

179
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,731
with your criminal
history, the judge will.

180
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,733
- Just plead guilty and let
me worry about the rest.

181
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,502
It's my life, okay.

182
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,305
Nobody runs it but me.

183
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:16,010
- All right, I'll
enter a guilty plea.

184
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,310
I hope you know
what you're in for.

185
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:19,914
- I've known my whole
life what I'm in for.

186
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,213
- We had a special
request for you.

187
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:03,791
- Will be at eight yourselves.

188
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,925
- D block
visitation will be between one.

189
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,630
- You also brought me
out of a horrible ditch,

190
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:11,098
out of the clay

191
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:14,935
and set my feet upon a rock
and establish my steps.

192
00:12:15,704 --> 00:12:17,805
Psalm 40, verse two.

193
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:18,872
- Amen.

194
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:21,710
- What's that supposed to mean?

195
00:12:22,644 --> 00:12:23,944
- Where you get stuck
in some quick sand,

196
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:25,811
guy's gonna pull you out?

197
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:26,981
- That's exactly what
it means to my brother.

198
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:31,051
See, every one of us
are behind these bars

199
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:32,987
because we fell into
some kind of quick sand.

200
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,154
- Yeah.

201
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:37,489
- Maybe not the real kind,
but the spiritual kind.

202
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:40,660
And the really sad thing
is, most of the time,

203
00:12:40,662 --> 00:12:42,329
this quick sand
we made ourselves,

204
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,734
you like using your fist to lie.

205
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,403
- Why, you wanna go?

206
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:58,143
- I used to be a fighter
too, just mad at the world,

207
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,014
blaming it for all my problems.

208
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:03,417
It turned out the person I was
really fighting was myself.

209
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:11,225
Took me a long time to
go from this, to this.

210
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,994
- But once I did, it
made all the difference.

211
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:17,264
Why don't you come
with us tonight?

212
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:19,768
I mean, what have
you got to lose?

213
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:24,572
I should asked what have
you got left to lose?

214
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:34,279
- Glad to see
everybody here tonight.

215
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,448
Jones, good to see you,
glad that everybody's here.

216
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,951
Steve, I'm glad you're
able to make it out.

217
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:39,953
And it's great to see
everybody here tonight.

218
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,954
Looking forward to a
great time, Bible study.

219
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,956
It's always a blessing
to see everybody.

220
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,794
And I hope that you've
got your Bibles with you.

221
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:49,196
Take just a moment.

222
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:50,128
- Hello Scott.

223
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,533
- Oh, hey warden.

224
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:55,035
- Glad to see you finally
here, have a seat.

225
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,803
Yeah, come on.

226
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:58,270
- Something a
little differently.

227
00:13:58,272 --> 00:13:59,641
Does everybody
know what this is?

228
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:01,909
Yeah, sure, we all do.

229
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,711
It's a yo-yo, its sole
purpose is to go up

230
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:07,446
and down and back and forth.

231
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:10,282
Unfortunately it's
like many of us,

232
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:13,053
we've been in and out
of jail, back and forth

233
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:16,791
so many times that
just makes you sick.

234
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:18,926
Just get so tired of it.

235
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:22,227
But yet we find ourselves
doing the same thing

236
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:26,064
over and over, my friends, it
doesn't have to be that way.

237
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:29,201
We don't have to stay
in this orange jumpsuit.

238
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:32,237
God has given us his grace,
he's given us his love.

239
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:34,940
He's given us his son
and through his son,

240
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:38,745
we can transcend these bars,
we can overcome the chains.

241
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:41,714
We can be free
through Jesus Christ.

242
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:44,584
The Bible says he that
hath the son hath life

243
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:48,253
and he that hath not
the son, hath not life.

244
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,822
The Bible says that
the thief cometh,

245
00:14:49,824 --> 00:14:53,593
but for to still and
to kill and to destroy.

246
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:55,961
But Jesus said, I am come
that you might have life

247
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:58,096
and have it more abundantly.

248
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:01,166
Romans 8:2 says that for the
law of the spirit of life

249
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,735
is found in Jesus Christ.

250
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:05,072
And it overcomes the law of sin.

251
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,508
My brothers with Jesus,
you can break these bars.

252
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,343
You can transcend these chains.

253
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:13,681
Are you sick and tired
of being like a yo-yo,

254
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:15,650
being pulled back and forth?

255
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:20,352
You can overcome, you
can cut this string.

256
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,655
If you want freedom,

257
00:15:22,657 --> 00:15:24,857
true freedom that these
bars cannot contain,

258
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:27,325
then I invite you tonight
to come to know the one

259
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,862
who can set you free.

260
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:33,198
Jesus said that I am the
way, the truth in the life.

261
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,869
And no man comes to the
father but through me,

262
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:39,539
every one of us is guilty
of sin and we deserve to pay

263
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,373
the price for sin.

264
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,876
But Jesus has paid the price.

265
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:45,345
All you have to do is believe.

266
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:49,016
All you have to do is
accept it, stop fighting,

267
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:53,187
stop resisting in
just surrender.

268
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:59,527
- And the Lord is my
light and my salvation,

269
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:01,629
whom shall I fear?

270
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:04,264
The Lord is the
stronghold of my life,

271
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,768
of whom shall I be afraid?

272
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:13,104
When evil do me, uttering
slanders against me.

273
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:16,811
My adversaries and, they
shall stumble and fall.

274
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:32,658
- Our father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name,

275
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,060
thy kingdom come, thy will be
down on earth as is in heaven.

276
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,461
Give us each day our daily bread

277
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:37,630
and forgive us our trespasses.

278
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:40,232
We figured those
trespass against us,

279
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:42,904
lead us is not in a temptation
but deliver us from for thy.

280
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:04,759
- What, you got a problem, what?

281
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,838
- Grace and power,
give you all the pain,

282
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,606
all the fear, all the
anxiety paralyzing me,

283
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:21,941
please free my mind and my body.

284
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:23,343
I'm gonna be what
I was meant to be.

285
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:24,278
Amen.

286
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,247
- Well done.

287
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:35,623
- Hello Scott, how you doing?

288
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,623
- Doing good, Mr. Pazera

289
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,958
- Have a seat please.

290
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,864
Well, your street
clothes still fit.

291
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:44,462
- Little snug, but
anything's better

292
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:45,365
than prison orange, sir.

293
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,302
- Yeah, I bet.

294
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:52,607
So you ready for the real world?

295
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:55,643
- Ready as I'll
ever be, I guess.

296
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:58,646
- You know, we want
you to understand

297
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:03,051
that we consider you one
of our success stories.

298
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,054
I mean you've
cleaned up real well.

299
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,690
Even earned your
associate's degree.

300
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:10,223
- Yes sir, business.

301
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,059
I'm gonna go to college
and get my bachelor's

302
00:18:13,061 --> 00:18:16,064
and maybe run my own
company one day, who knows?

303
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:20,568
- No reason in the world why
you can't, really proud of you.

304
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,071
You understand that don't you?

305
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:27,307
- Thank you, Mr Pazera, that
really means a lot.

306
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:31,376
- Well, I would say don't
be as stranger, but.

307
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:33,244
- I hope I never
see you again, sir.

308
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,749
And I mean that in a good way.

309
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:36,247
- Yeah.

310
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,585
Look, you take care,

311
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:41,556
but don't forget, in all
your ways acknowledge him

312
00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:43,490
and he'll make
your path straight.

313
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:45,591
Proverbs.

314
00:18:45,593 --> 00:18:48,096
- Three, six, yes sir.

315
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:50,763
- Thank you for everything, sir.

316
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:52,066
- You're welcome.

317
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,102
Now get outta here.

318
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,671
- Yes, sir.

319
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:23,430
♪ Every page before
was a man defeated ♪

320
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:32,607
♪ Every page before was
a life off the tracks ♪

321
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:42,850
♪ Every page before was

322
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:53,795
♪ I was on my knees

323
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:05,807
- Scott, this is looking
pretty good, man.

324
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:07,909
Welcome aboard.

325
00:20:08,976 --> 00:20:09,911
- Really?

326
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:11,079
- Yeah.

327
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:12,912
- Thank you very much.

328
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:13,881
- Happy to have you here.

329
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:19,252
- I'm gonna go get this out.

330
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:17,570
- Look, look, I know the
numbers are a little down.

331
00:22:17,572 --> 00:22:19,173
They're gonna come back up,
there's no reason to panic.

332
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:23,410
No, no you don't tell me to
listen, I tell you to listen.

333
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:33,619
Everything is fine, just
stop worrying Dwight.

334
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:36,322
- I am worrying Scott,
you're late every day.

335
00:22:36,324 --> 00:22:37,756
Your numbers are down.

336
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:39,258
You look horrible.

337
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,196
I mean, dare I ask you
to take a drug test?

338
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,098
- Me?

339
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:47,268
Why don't you ask everybody
down on the third floor, Dwight.

340
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,668
There's more snowfall around
down there than in Colorado.

341
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,603
- Look, Scott.

342
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:52,538
- Don't look me Dwight.

343
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,040
I have made you a ton
of money and all I ask

344
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,342
is that you just back off.

345
00:22:56,344 --> 00:22:58,512
- Not everything's about money.

346
00:22:58,713 --> 00:23:00,546
It's about professionalism.

347
00:23:00,548 --> 00:23:04,919
So far, I haven't seen any.

348
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:14,629
- How's that for
professionalism, Dwight.

349
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:36,982
- Hey man, I got a
surprise for you.

350
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:37,818
- Yeah?

351
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:39,484
- Yeah man.

352
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:40,519
- Check the glove box.

353
00:23:40,521 --> 00:23:41,787
- You got something for me?

354
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:44,156
- Yeah, got a little
something, something.

355
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:45,824
- Nice, thanks man.

356
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:47,328
- Of course, man.

357
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:49,163
So what happened to the BMW?

358
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,330
- Company car.

359
00:23:51,332 --> 00:23:54,967
- Oh, is it getting fixed?

360
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:55,503
- Not exactly.

361
00:23:56,337 --> 00:23:57,803
You can't drive a company car

362
00:23:57,805 --> 00:23:59,505
if you no longer
work for the company.

363
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:01,008
- What, you quit?

364
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:02,074
- Terminated.

365
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:04,078
- Dude, what happened?

366
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:07,581
- Poor work habits,
poor attitude Scott.

367
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:10,416
Plus I didn't fill
up the lemonade cup.

368
00:24:10,418 --> 00:24:11,319
- Lemonade?

369
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,889
Oh, well yeah, gotcha.

370
00:24:17,425 --> 00:24:19,260
- You got a dollar bill?

371
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:25,564
- Dude, it is a
sad day my friend,

372
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:26,667
when I have more money than you.

373
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:28,769
- Tell me about it.

374
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:33,774
- So does Tracy
know you got canned?

375
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:35,242
- No, not yet.

376
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:36,444
She's not gonna be too
happy about it either.

377
00:24:39,113 --> 00:24:41,280
Man, let's just go get wasted.

378
00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:43,015
I wanna forget about all
this stuff right now.

379
00:24:43,017 --> 00:24:46,620
- Yeah, dude, dude,
done, say no more.

380
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:49,955
If a party is what you need,
then a party you shall receive.

381
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:54,195
- Yo man.

382
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:57,365
We are all out of booze, are
you sober enough to make a run?

383
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,702
- I don't know, where's Sam?

384
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:03,270
- Passed out in the bathtub.

385
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:06,040
You buy, I'll fly.

386
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:11,579
- Should do it.

387
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:13,581
Thanks.

388
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:19,385
- 307 Dispatch.

389
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:22,688
I've got Scott Highberger
passed out at Larry's Liquors.

390
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,957
Let me a few more units please.

391
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,692
- 104307, do
they need to bump it up?

392
00:25:26,694 --> 00:25:28,694
- He's passed out right now,

393
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:31,298
but if I know Highberger,
it'll end up in a fight.

394
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:41,642
Scott, Highberger
again, let's go fellas.

395
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,318
Rise and shine sleeping beauty.

396
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,888
Come on Scott, let|s go.

397
00:25:54,488 --> 00:25:55,621
- I'm good.

398
00:25:55,623 --> 00:25:57,056
Listen to me, you
guys, listen to me.

399
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:58,390
You guys do do me
every single time.

400
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:00,893
You ain't got
nothing on me, man.

401
00:26:00,895 --> 00:26:02,628
You ain't got nothing
on me, all right?

402
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,329
You ain't got nothing on me man.

403
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:05,130
You ain't get nothing.

404
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:05,900
Ain't get nothing on me.

405
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:08,669
Leave me alone,
man, come on man.

406
00:26:09,904 --> 00:26:10,971
- Get him in the car.

407
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:44,872
- What's up punk?

408
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:50,344
- Excuse me, fellas.

409
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,139
- Highberger, visitor.

410
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:23,444
- Hey mom.

411
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:24,613
- Hey honey.

412
00:27:25,446 --> 00:27:27,815
You've cleaned up,
gained a few pounds.

413
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:30,816
- Three square meals a day

414
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:32,554
and all the time in
the world exercise.

415
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:34,556
- Well you look good.

416
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:36,724
- Thanks.

417
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:43,230
- Come on mom, spill it.

418
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:44,331
- Spill what?

419
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:51,172
- You came here alone,
what's going on?

420
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,975
- There's no easy
way to say this,

421
00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:59,246
I went to the doctor last week.

422
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:03,083
They ran some tests.

423
00:28:03,552 --> 00:28:07,254
One came back positive,
I have cancer.

424
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:11,892
- Cancer?

425
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:21,235
- The doctors believe
they can treat it.

426
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,938
So I don't want you
to worry about it.

427
00:28:24,573 --> 00:28:26,240
I just came here in
person to tell you myself

428
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:29,678
so you wouldn't have to
hear it from anybody else.

429
00:28:29,944 --> 00:28:31,445
- You're gonna be
okay though, right?

430
00:28:33,247 --> 00:28:35,950
- I don't want you to
have to worry about this.

431
00:28:36,283 --> 00:28:37,451
The important thing is you.

432
00:28:39,286 --> 00:28:45,292
I want you to get clean,
I want you to be somebody.

433
00:28:47,696 --> 00:28:49,463
- I will mom.

434
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:54,101
- Promise me, Scott, promise
me you're gonna stay clean.

435
00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:58,472
- I promise.

436
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:01,543
- I love you.

437
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,212
- I love you mom.

in, take a seat.

448
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:04,071
So I got a new one for you.

449
00:30:04,438 --> 00:30:06,004
16 year old kid looks
at his dad says, dad,

450
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:07,439
can I borrow the car?

451
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:09,609
Dad looks at his
son, says, no son,

452
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:11,445
not until you cut your hair.

453
00:30:11,746 --> 00:30:13,445
Son looks at his dad says, dad,

454
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:15,615
you realize that
Jesus had long hair.

455
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:19,619
The dad looks at his son
and says, you're right son.

456
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:21,623
And he also walked
everywhere he went.

457
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:26,458
- That's a good one, sir.

458
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,461
- Yeah right.

459
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:30,297
You know, you're the only
one that laughs at my jokes.

460
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:32,099
But thank you.

461
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:36,470
- What's this?

462
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:38,640
- Open it up.

463
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:44,142
- What happened
to that kid Scott?

464
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:45,780
He was doing so well.

465
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,986
- I don't know, I guess
he just lost his mind.

466
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:57,391
- When he had to go back to
prison to find it again, really?

467
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,894
You get outta here real soon.

468
00:31:02,396 --> 00:31:05,399
What's gonna change after you
leave these bars behind you?

469
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:07,800
You just gonna throw away

470
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:09,370
everything you've
accomplished here,

471
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:11,071
just leave it at the front gate.

472
00:31:12,741 --> 00:31:14,239
- No sir.

473
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:15,075
I'm gonna do better.

474
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:16,576
- Yeah, that's what
you said last time.

475
00:31:16,578 --> 00:31:19,748
- But I mean it this
time, I mean it this time.

476
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:22,948
- Yeah, well I hope that's true.

477
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,554
I really do, speaking
as your warden,

478
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,225
I really hope you stick to
the straight and narrow.

479
00:31:34,763 --> 00:31:37,597
Is it okay if I talk to
you as a brother in Christ?

480
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,600
- Of course.

481
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:41,335
- You know when you left here,

482
00:31:41,603 --> 00:31:43,101
you turned your
back on the only one

483
00:31:43,103 --> 00:31:45,774
who would never turn
his back on you,

484
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:48,843
created this void in your life.

485
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:52,112
Tried to fill it with drugs,
alcohol, Lord knows what else,

486
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:57,451
I've seen you working out
around the gym, right?

487
00:32:00,354 --> 00:32:03,355
And what happens when
you exercise a muscle?

488
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:04,358
- Get stronger.

489
00:32:06,026 --> 00:32:09,163
- Exactly, don't you
ever forget that?

490
00:32:11,198 --> 00:32:13,498
So you exercise your
faith, guess what?

491
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,372
It gets stronger, but say
you choose to exercise sin,

492
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:24,211
it gets bigger and bigger
until it consumes you.

493
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:33,385
- A man cannot serve two masters

494
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:36,023
for you either love
one and hate the other.

495
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:39,026
- Yeah, Matthew 6:24.

496
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,893
Yeah, you can say that
all you want up here,

497
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:42,864
but you gotta get it here son.

498
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:48,636
Can I pray with you?

499
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:56,709
Heavenly father, I
pray over this man.

500
00:32:56,711 --> 00:33:00,414
Your son, your servant,
Scott Highberger.

501
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:24,504
- Hello, Hello, dude,

502
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:26,071
you're supposed to pick
him up, did you forget?

503
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:27,573
I'm gonna be late for work.

504
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:28,408
- Hi buddy.

505
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,842
- I'm working
really late tonight.

506
00:33:29,844 --> 00:33:31,076
I'll be back very
early tomorrow morning.

507
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:32,410
All of his stuff
is in here, okay?

508
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:33,178
- Okay.

509
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,514
- Can you clean up around here?

510
00:33:34,516 --> 00:33:35,182
It's disgusting.

511
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:36,985
- We're just gonna be
chilling, it's fine.

512
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:38,684
- I love you baby, okay.

513
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:40,087
Be good for your daddy.

514
00:33:41,221 --> 00:33:43,925
Come on man, like, bye.

515
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:48,694
- No man, he's
still not back yet.

516
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:49,597
I don't know.

517
00:33:49,864 --> 00:33:51,864
He was supposed to just go
pick up a little something,

518
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:53,367
should have been back
like two hours ago.

519
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:55,267
Yeah, I don't know.

520
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:59,007
I mean, yeah, I can do that.

521
00:34:00,107 --> 00:34:01,674
All right.

522
00:34:01,676 --> 00:34:03,241
All right, I'll be right there.

523
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:04,177
Right, bye.

524
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:09,017
I forgot about you little man.

525
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:14,419
Yeah.

526
00:34:14,421 --> 00:34:20,193
Hey, hey man, come here buddy.

527
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,763
Wanna go get a little
food or something.

528
00:34:23,765 --> 00:34:26,133
Gonna go for a little ride.

529
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:33,500
Oh buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.

530
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:45,445
- Where have you been?

531
00:35:46,514 --> 00:35:47,412
What are you talking about?

532
00:35:47,414 --> 00:35:47,949
He needed.

533
00:35:48,116 --> 00:35:49,081
- I don't wanna here it, okay.

534
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:51,753
- He needed food, you
know I needed food.

535
00:35:52,285 --> 00:35:52,787
- Oh my God.

536
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:58,793
You two are the most
worthless men I have ever met.

537
00:36:01,796 --> 00:36:04,597
- Come on, would you do this

538
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:07,232
if you had your own
kids, seriously?

539
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:08,235
- I don't have kids.

540
00:36:20,548 --> 00:36:21,381
- Hello.

541
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,453
- Scott, what's the matter?

542
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:29,957
- I'm a terrible person, mom.

543
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:32,894
- No, you're not,
what's wrong honey?

544
00:36:35,063 --> 00:36:36,898
- I took a little kid
on a drug run with me.

545
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:40,267
- A kid, what kid, what
are you talking about?

546
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,540
- I'm gonna make the
world a better place Mom.

547
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:49,577
It's gonna be better
without me and it mom.

548
00:36:50,044 --> 00:36:50,477
- Scott.

549
00:36:52,747 --> 00:36:53,915
- Just wanna apologize.

550
00:36:55,883 --> 00:37:00,888
All the stuff I've done
to you, love you, man.

551
00:37:01,923 --> 00:37:03,321
- Scott, where are you?

552
00:37:03,323 --> 00:37:04,324
Talk to me.

553
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:15,300
- Open the door Scott, your
mother called every hotel.

554
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:17,739
We know you're in
there, open up.

555
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:26,178
Oh man, step back.

556
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,182
Dispatch, give me a
squad at this location.

557
00:37:28,683 --> 00:37:29,183
Scott.

558
00:37:34,522 --> 00:37:35,556
He's still alive.

559
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:37,024
Have that squad step it up.

560
00:37:40,494 --> 00:37:42,697
Relax, relax, I'm
here to help you.

561
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:18,465
- Please help me God,
I can't do this alone.

562
00:38:29,811 --> 00:38:31,112
- Hieberger, let's go.

563
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:34,379
- Which cell block are we going

564
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:35,817
- Nope, you're outta here.

565
00:38:50,898 --> 00:38:53,498
- What, they cut you
loose, just like that?

566
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,503
- Yeah, just like that.

567
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,074
No criminal charges, even
paid for my stitches.

568
00:39:03,744 --> 00:39:05,578
- Got love the criminal
justice system, man.

569
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,314
They give you three hots

570
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:08,581
in a cot, free education
and free healthcare.

571
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:11,150
So you break the law
and reap the rewards.

572
00:39:11,152 --> 00:39:13,252
- Yeah, I gotta try
to stay free and clear

573
00:39:13,254 --> 00:39:14,220
this time though, man,

574
00:39:14,222 --> 00:39:15,590
I really dodged the
bullet with this one.

575
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,991
- I don't know, sounds like
it's a reason to celebrate.

576
00:39:18,993 --> 00:39:20,425
Let's go party.

577
00:39:20,427 --> 00:39:23,931
- No, I just wanna get home.

578
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:28,569
- Dude, you ain't got no home.

579
00:39:36,277 --> 00:39:37,945
- I guess we're
going to Harley's.

580
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:40,915
- Let's go to Harley's.

581
00:39:55,129 --> 00:39:57,798
- Look who we got here, my man.

582
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:01,466
- Glad to see you're
doing okay man.

583
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:02,467
- What's up man?

584
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:03,869
- Yeah, I'm doing okay, man.

585
00:40:03,871 --> 00:40:05,438
Had some tough times,
things are turning around.

586
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:08,207
- Well I'm sure we got something
here to lift your spirits.

587
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:09,275
- I'm sure you do man.

588
00:40:09,277 --> 00:40:10,609
- It seems like you're
pretty taken care of.

589
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:11,610
I think I'm gonna get myself

590
00:40:11,612 --> 00:40:14,046
a little something,
something too, yeah.

591
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:14,647
- Okay, see you a few.

592
00:40:14,649 --> 00:40:15,446
I'll catch you.

593
00:40:15,448 --> 00:40:16,150
- Yeah, all right.

594
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:21,120
How's Sam been doing?

595
00:40:21,122 --> 00:40:23,891
- He's been doing right I
guess, just hitting it hard.

596
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:31,664
- Hello Scott, long time no see.

597
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:32,965
- How you doing Layla?

598
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:33,832
- Lonely.

599
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:35,000
- Okay.

600
00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:37,236
- Take it easy girl, my
man just got outta prison.

601
00:40:37,238 --> 00:40:39,171
Give us a few minutes, yeah.

602
00:40:39,173 --> 00:40:40,673
- I'll catch you later.

603
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:41,842
- Sure you will Layla.

604
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:47,346
- Anyways, I wanna pick that
business degree brain of yours.

605
00:40:47,348 --> 00:40:49,083
- All right, what
you got in mind?

606
00:40:56,924 --> 00:40:58,691
- Wait seriously,
you could do that?

607
00:40:58,693 --> 00:40:59,527
- Absolutely man.

608
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,593
All we gotta do is sit
you with an LLC, right?

609
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:03,228
It'll look like a totally
legitimate company.

610
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,763
And then you could funnel
whatever money through it

611
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:05,666
that you want to.

612
00:41:05,766 --> 00:41:08,767
- Alright then, sounds
perfect, let's do it.

613
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:10,438
- All right, done.

614
00:41:13,441 --> 00:41:14,608
Look at Jr, over there,

615
00:41:16,944 --> 00:41:18,412
he bit it hard, hasn't he?

616
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:22,183
Hey Sam, you doing all right?

617
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:29,690
Sam, Sam, Sam.

618
00:42:58,646 --> 00:42:59,645
- Hello.

619
00:42:59,647 --> 00:43:00,446
- Dad?

620
00:43:00,448 --> 00:43:01,782
- How are you son?

621
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,917
- Not good.

622
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:06,418
- No?

623
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,826
- No, I was wondering,

624
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:17,532
I think I could come
down and see you dad?

625
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:21,202
- Are you clean?

626
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:24,271
- Just gotta get outta
here for a while Dad.

627
00:43:25,673 --> 00:43:27,274
This place is killing me.

628
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:33,212
I didn't have
anyone else to call.

629
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:35,282
- Okay, come down.

630
00:43:35,883 --> 00:43:38,553
But no drinking
and no drugs Scott.

631
00:43:45,893 --> 00:43:47,228
Breakfast is ready.

632
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:53,398
You okay?

633
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,235
- Yeah, yeah.

634
00:43:54,702 --> 00:43:57,705
Just my stomach's
bothering me a little bit.

635
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:02,076
- You'll be better after you
get a little food in you,

636
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:04,145
you wanna butter some bread?

637
00:44:04,712 --> 00:44:05,146
- Sure.

638
00:44:08,048 --> 00:44:09,316
- Three eggs, right?

639
00:44:10,718 --> 00:44:11,817
- Yeah.

640
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:13,152
- Used to drive
your mother crazy

641
00:44:13,154 --> 00:44:16,455
you and I wanting an odd
number of eggs every morning.

642
00:44:16,457 --> 00:44:17,723
Orange juice?

643
00:44:17,725 --> 00:44:18,724
- No thanks Dad.

644
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:21,295
- Come on, it's Florida,
you gotta have some OJ.

645
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:29,837
You sure you're okay?

646
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:31,739
- Yeah.

647
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:34,909
I think it's the time change.

648
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,510
- Nice try, Indiana

649
00:44:37,512 --> 00:44:40,245
and this part of Florida's
on the same time zone.

650
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:44,016
- Oh, I just need to
catch up on my sleep then.

651
00:44:44,018 --> 00:44:46,185
- You've been sleeping
for two days kid.

652
00:44:46,187 --> 00:44:49,589
Anyway, I got some
errands to run today.

653
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:51,356
I'll pick up a
newspaper and tomorrow

654
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:53,526
you start looking for a job.

655
00:44:53,528 --> 00:44:55,194
You can stay here until
you get enough money

656
00:44:55,196 --> 00:44:56,864
for an apartment, is that fair?

657
00:44:58,766 --> 00:44:59,865
- Yes.

658
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:00,933
- Okay.

659
00:45:00,935 --> 00:45:01,869
- Thanks dad.

660
00:45:11,613 --> 00:45:14,949
- Yes, what is it?

661
00:47:14,703 --> 00:47:15,901
- I need to cash
that check please.

662
00:47:15,903 --> 00:47:17,539
- Sure, may I see
your ID please?

663
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:22,209
Indiana?

664
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,443
- Yeah, I'm visiting my dad.

665
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:26,213
That's his check, he banks here.

666
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:29,718
You can see we have the
same last name though.

667
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,229
Hey pop.

668
00:47:44,231 --> 00:47:45,933
Get your errands done already.

669
00:47:47,468 --> 00:47:48,737
- You stole from me.

670
00:47:49,738 --> 00:47:50,969
- What, what are
you talking about?

671
00:47:50,971 --> 00:47:52,404
I would never do that.

672
00:47:52,406 --> 00:47:53,575
- You stole from me.

673
00:47:55,075 --> 00:47:57,945
I opened my home to you
and you stole from me.

674
00:47:59,814 --> 00:48:00,946
- Dad, what are
you talking about?

675
00:48:00,948 --> 00:48:02,751
I would never steal from you.

676
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:04,118
- The bank called,

677
00:48:04,485 --> 00:48:06,954
the manager was suspicious
about a check they cashed.

678
00:48:10,357 --> 00:48:14,294
- I just needed a loan, I
thought you'd be okay with it.

679
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:16,296
- There's puke all
over the bathroom.

680
00:48:16,731 --> 00:48:18,298
You've been drinking
my mouthwash.

681
00:48:18,499 --> 00:48:20,165
- No, I was just freshening up.

682
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:21,168
- Just get out.

683
00:48:22,169 --> 00:48:23,838
You haven't changed one bit.

684
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:24,672
- But dad.

685
00:48:25,005 --> 00:48:27,174
- No buts, just go.

686
00:48:27,809 --> 00:48:30,310
Or I call the cops and you
go to jail for forgery.

687
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:32,306
- Check this guy out.

688
00:49:39,614 --> 00:49:41,547
- How you doing
over here, you okay?

689
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:42,951
- Yeah, I'm good, thanks.

690
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:47,321
- Yo, who are you?

691
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:49,958
No one.

692
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,662
- Why are you tossing pennies?

693
00:49:56,664 --> 00:49:58,332
- They don't make
anything smaller.

694
00:50:01,168 --> 00:50:02,402
- Are you crazy or something?

695
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,174
- Bullseye.

696
00:50:08,743 --> 00:50:11,679
- Looks like we gotta teach
him a little lesson in respect.

697
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:16,751
- Wanna teach me about respect?

698
00:50:17,652 --> 00:50:18,518
All right, how about you and me?

699
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,821
One on one.

700
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:26,828
- You got it.

701
00:50:48,348 --> 00:50:50,384
- Hey man, that's my car.

702
00:51:11,806 --> 00:51:12,707
- What is this?

703
00:51:14,542 --> 00:51:15,877
Ah, you gotta be kidding me.

704
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,181
- Good afternoon, sir.

705
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:56,017
The reason I stopped you

706
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:58,985
is you were going 57
and a 30 back there.

707
00:51:58,987 --> 00:52:00,521
Can I see your license please?

708
00:52:01,656 --> 00:52:02,690
- Yeah.

709
00:52:06,426 --> 00:52:08,428
- Does
somebody break and start.

710
00:52:10,098 --> 00:52:12,100
- Indiana,
this your car?

711
00:52:13,601 --> 00:52:16,269
- No, a buddy loaned it to me.

712
00:52:16,436 --> 00:52:18,271
- Okay,
you been drinking?

713
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:20,440
- I had a beer earlier.

714
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:23,111
- Alright, sit tight.

715
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:39,426
- Thank you.

716
00:52:52,974 --> 00:52:55,777
Do a report and
the disturbances.

717
00:52:57,145 --> 00:52:59,147
- Sir, I need you to
step outta the car.

718
00:53:01,649 --> 00:53:02,447
- What for?

719
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:04,251
- Sir, just step outta the car.

720
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:05,853
Step around the front please.

721
00:53:09,256 --> 00:53:10,024
- What for?

722
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:13,528
- You got a suspended license.

723
00:53:13,961 --> 00:53:16,130
- Oh, can you just write
me a ticket or something?

724
00:53:17,297 --> 00:53:19,033
- What happened at
that bar back there?

725
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:24,572
- Oh, that was just
a misunderstanding.

726
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:30,044
- County county, do you
wanna be in a foot pursuit?

727
00:55:27,662 --> 00:55:31,666
I'd like to make a collect
call please, Indiana.

728
00:55:45,412 --> 00:55:47,081
Scotty, is that you?

729
00:55:48,649 --> 00:55:49,650
- Yeah man, it's me.

730
00:55:54,155 --> 00:55:54,922
- How you doing?

731
00:55:55,422 --> 00:55:56,655
- Thanks for picking me up, man.

732
00:55:56,657 --> 00:55:58,159
- No problem.

733
00:56:07,068 --> 00:56:09,270
- Hey man, me casa, su casa.

734
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:10,271
- Thanks bro.

735
00:56:14,775 --> 00:56:15,941
- You need a cold one?

736
00:56:15,943 --> 00:56:17,778
Look like you could
really use it.

737
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,581
- No, I'm okay, thanks.

738
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:24,285
- Oh, I got it, I got
what you need in the back.

739
00:56:35,462 --> 00:56:37,464
You want some of that, or?

740
00:56:38,465 --> 00:56:39,533
Scott, Scott,

741
00:56:44,138 --> 00:56:46,307
dude, where are you going?

742
00:56:50,044 --> 00:56:52,479
Scotty, where are you going?

743
00:56:52,947 --> 00:56:55,616
Call me when you get
picked back up again.

744
00:56:56,817 --> 00:56:58,485
Dude finally lost his mind.

00:57:32,253 --> 00:57:33,087
- It's cold.

750
00:57:33,921 --> 00:57:37,690
- Ah, it might be cold on the
outside, but the word of God

751
00:57:37,692 --> 00:57:39,593
keep us warm on the inside,
you know what I'm saying?

752
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:41,529
- Sure.

753
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:44,265
Could still use a coat though.

754
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,437
- I got something that'll warm
me up like a warm blanket.

755
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:55,242
- Nah, I'm good man, thanks.

756
00:57:56,444 --> 00:57:58,245
- Come on man, you
won't regret it.

757
00:58:00,114 --> 00:58:02,247
- I don't really wanna listen
to any music right now.

758
00:58:02,249 --> 00:58:03,682
- Ah, man, this ain't music.

759
00:58:03,684 --> 00:58:05,184
This is the word.

760
00:58:05,186 --> 00:58:07,822
This is the bread of
life that feel you up.

761
00:58:08,356 --> 00:58:10,723
Check this cat out, his
preaching is something else.

762
00:58:10,725 --> 00:58:12,024
Sermon's about Joseph.

763
00:58:12,026 --> 00:58:14,362
You know about Joseph, right?

764
00:58:16,197 --> 00:58:20,167
- Yeah, he had a coat.

765
00:58:33,581 --> 00:58:35,447
- But the
Lord was with Joseph

766
00:58:35,449 --> 00:58:37,883
and showed him mercy
and gave him favor

767
00:58:37,885 --> 00:58:40,619
in the sight of the
keeper of the prison.

768
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:44,056

and God forgives you.

- Morning, welcome home.

779
01:01:10,404 --> 01:01:11,737
- Hey man, welcome to over life.

780
01:01:11,739 --> 01:01:12,738
I'm CJ.

781
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,573
- I'm Scott.

782
01:01:13,575 --> 01:01:14,740
Nice to meet you Scott.

783
01:01:14,742 --> 01:01:16,008
Right through the door, sir.

784
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:16,911
- Thank very much.

785
01:01:18,012 --> 01:01:21,180
- Proverbs 10:5 says, he
who gathers during summer

786
01:01:21,182 --> 01:01:22,850
and takes advantage
of his opportunities

787
01:01:23,317 --> 01:01:25,350
is a son who acts wisely,

788
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:29,087
but he who sleeps during
harvest and ignores the moment

789
01:01:29,089 --> 01:01:33,526
of opportunity is a son
who acts shamefully.

790
01:01:33,528 --> 01:01:36,161
Jesus is communicating
to his disciples,

791
01:01:36,163 --> 01:01:38,864
the harvest, it's too
big for any of us.

792
01:01:38,866 --> 01:01:40,365
And we need to pray for God

793
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:43,536
to send more workers
into the field.

794
01:01:43,538 --> 01:01:45,771
The word worker here
in the Greek is,

795
01:01:45,773 --> 01:01:50,209
and it's used 15 times
in the New Testament.

796
01:01:50,211 --> 01:01:53,011
It elevates action
over business.

797
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:54,213
A worker is a disciple

798
01:01:54,215 --> 01:01:56,882
who is actively
involved in the process

799
01:01:56,884 --> 01:02:00,620
of evangelizing the lost
or establishing the saved.

800
01:02:00,622 --> 01:02:03,222
Let me clarify that a
worker is not someone

801
01:02:03,224 --> 01:02:05,324
on full-time staff at a church.

802
01:02:05,326 --> 01:02:08,126
Once you become a
Christ follower,

803
01:02:08,128 --> 01:02:11,363
you become a
co-labor with Christ.

804
01:02:11,365 --> 01:02:15,367
If a paycheck is what motivates
you to minister to people,

805
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:17,604
you're doing it for
the wrong reason.

806
01:02:17,606 --> 01:02:21,473
Look at Paul in Acts
28 versus 30 and 31.

807
01:02:21,475 --> 01:02:24,977
It says Paul lived
there for two full years

808
01:02:24,979 --> 01:02:28,648
at his own expense, in
his own rented lodging

809
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,816
and welcomed all
who came to him,

810
01:02:30,818 --> 01:02:33,819
preaching and proclaiming
the kingdom of God

811
01:02:33,821 --> 01:02:36,723
and teaching about
the Lord Jesus Christ

812
01:02:36,725 --> 01:02:39,458
with all openness and boldness,

813
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,630
unhindered and unrestrained.

814
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:46,568
Amen.

815
01:02:52,641 --> 01:02:54,006
- We work on the ones

816
01:02:54,008 --> 01:02:56,908
that you have to have
committed to your memory,

817
01:02:56,910 --> 01:03:00,412
that's how works.

818
01:03:00,414 --> 01:03:01,246
Anyway, okay.

819
01:03:01,248 --> 01:03:02,314
Hey, very nice to meet you.

820
01:03:02,316 --> 01:03:04,651
Thank you, thank you so much.

821
01:03:04,653 --> 01:03:06,084
Thank you.

822
01:03:06,086 --> 01:03:08,255
Hey, what's up?

823
01:03:08,422 --> 01:03:09,591
I'm Dave.

824
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:11,959
- Oh, hey, I saw you
preaching up there.

825
01:03:12,126 --> 01:03:13,726
My name is Scott.

826
01:03:13,728 --> 01:03:16,094
- Hi Scott, nice to meet
you, first time here?

827
01:03:16,096 --> 01:03:16,995
- First time, yeah.

828
01:03:16,997 --> 01:03:18,397
Hope it didn't put you to sleep.

829
01:03:18,399 --> 01:03:19,766
Sermon a little long, but.

830
01:03:19,768 --> 01:03:21,768
- No, no it was great.

831
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:22,671
- Good.

832
01:03:23,003 --> 01:03:24,102
- Great, yeah, well thank you.

833
01:03:24,104 --> 01:03:25,605
All right I'm gonna get going.

834
01:03:25,607 --> 01:03:26,438
- Come back anytime.

835
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,105
- Okay.

836
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:27,941
- All right.

837
01:03:30,277 --> 01:03:33,782
Hey Scott, crazy question.

838
01:03:35,617 --> 01:03:36,917
Are you looking for work?

839
01:03:40,187 --> 01:03:40,921
- What are you thinking?

840
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:43,957
- Well we're kind of in
desperate need around here.

841
01:03:44,526 --> 01:03:46,526
Just for clean up,
stacking chairs,

842
01:03:46,528 --> 01:03:48,763
actually mopping floors
believe it or not.

843
01:03:49,296 --> 01:03:51,897
- You know, I actually have a lo
of experience mopping.

844
01:03:51,899 --> 01:03:53,033
- No way, Seriously

845
01:03:53,434 --> 01:03:53,967
- I do.

846
01:03:54,803 --> 01:03:55,369
- um...

847
01:03:56,805 --> 01:03:59,639
Sure, I'll take it, you have
time, can I show you around?

848
01:03:59,641 --> 01:04:00,272
You have time?

849
01:04:00,274 --> 01:04:01,106
Can I show you
around?

850
01:04:01,108 --> 01:04:01,940
Yeah, now?

851
01:04:01,942 --> 01:04:03,141
- Yeah, like five, 10 minutes

852
01:04:03,143 --> 01:04:04,044
just to show you
around the place.

853
01:04:04,378 --> 01:04:06,046
- All right, okay.

854
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:23,090
- Scott, you already
stacking chairs?

855
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:25,223
- Of course pastor.

856
01:05:25,225 --> 01:05:27,194
- Church's only been
over 20 minutes.

857
01:05:28,362 --> 01:05:30,097
You are a godsend,
do you know that?

858
01:05:33,601 --> 01:05:34,869
Did I say something wrong?

859
01:05:39,841 --> 01:05:43,210
- I just been needing to
talk to you about something.

860
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:45,880
- Sounds serious, what's up?

861
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:50,217
Step into my office.

862
01:05:57,291 --> 01:05:58,125
So what you got?

863
01:06:01,563 --> 01:06:09,702
- Well, haven't always
been, I used to be.

864
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:14,039
- A troublemaker,
addict, alcoholic, felon.

865
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:15,543
I know, so what?

866
01:06:17,645 --> 01:06:18,945
- You're not worried?

867
01:06:18,947 --> 01:06:19,879
- About, what?

868
01:06:19,881 --> 01:06:21,112
That you're gonna drink

869
01:06:21,114 --> 01:06:22,617
all the communion wine
here at the church.

870
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:25,818
We use great juice Scott,
let me ask a question.

871
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:26,821
An important one.

872
01:06:28,222 --> 01:06:30,556
Do you believe Christ died
on the cross for your sins?

873
01:06:30,558 --> 01:06:31,456
- Of course.

874
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:32,792
- And do you believe
the blood of Christ

875
01:06:32,794 --> 01:06:34,796
is sufficient to
wash your sins away?

876
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:38,631
- I'm just worried about
what other people think.

877
01:06:38,633 --> 01:06:40,501
- It doesn't matter
what other people think,

878
01:06:40,668 --> 01:06:42,503
what matters is what God thinks.

879
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:44,672
He says you're redeemed,
you're redeemed.

880
01:06:45,172 --> 01:06:48,242
- But I've done so much.

881
01:06:48,308 --> 01:06:51,245
- It doesn't matter, period.

882
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,247
Let me ask you something,
when you were in lockup,

883
01:06:55,249 --> 01:06:58,185
did you meet other prisoners
who had come to know Christ?

884
01:07:00,087 --> 01:07:00,855
- Yeah.

885
01:07:02,857 --> 01:07:04,926
We called them
the crucifix crew.

886
01:07:07,227 --> 01:07:09,263
- And I guessing there
were a bunch of choir boys

887
01:07:09,764 --> 01:07:12,430
who were only in there for a
few parking tickets, right?

888
01:07:12,432 --> 01:07:13,267
- When you're inside,

889
01:07:13,601 --> 01:07:15,400
you don't really talk about
what you're locked up for.

890
01:07:15,402 --> 01:07:17,269
But judging by their sentences,

891
01:07:17,271 --> 01:07:19,841
they did some pretty bad things.

892
01:07:22,109 --> 01:07:23,443
A few of them were lifers.

893
01:07:23,945 --> 01:07:24,411
- Yeah.

894
01:07:25,112 --> 01:07:26,948
- Worse the crime, harder
the punishment, right?

895
01:07:28,115 --> 01:07:29,249
- Something like that.

896
01:07:31,118 --> 01:07:35,122
- So can you imagine
any harder punishment

897
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:38,593
than being nailed to
a cross until you die?

898
01:07:39,794 --> 01:07:40,460
- No.

899
01:07:41,461 --> 01:07:44,298
- Exactly, what sin could
not be covered by that?

900
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:47,635
Clean up.

901
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,774
- I'll tell you, I sure wish
some more guys in the joint

902
01:07:52,874 --> 01:07:53,975
could understand what Jesus did

903
01:07:54,308 --> 01:07:55,777
so that they too could be saved.

904
01:07:56,310 --> 01:08:00,815
- Wait a minute, like
a prison ministry?

905
01:08:03,885 --> 01:08:04,719
- Yeah.

906
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:06,453
- Yeah.

907
01:08:12,026 --> 01:08:13,393
- Hey pastor Vanessa.

908
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,395
- Hey you, what
brings you in here?

909
01:08:15,697 --> 01:08:17,195
- Pastor Dave says he
needed my help down here

910
01:08:17,197 --> 01:08:18,231
at the church
thrift store today.

911
01:08:18,465 --> 01:08:19,065
- He did did he?

912
01:08:19,067 --> 01:08:19,901
- Yeah.

913
01:08:20,334 --> 01:08:21,701
- Well, what I actually asked
was for him to come help me,

914
01:08:21,703 --> 01:08:22,802
but that's okay.

915
01:08:22,804 --> 01:08:25,238
It looks like my husband
did the old switcheroo,

916
01:08:25,573 --> 01:08:26,541
Danielle and I
could use some help.

917
01:08:26,908 --> 01:08:28,042
And it's good to see
you just the same.

918
01:08:28,576 --> 01:08:29,077
- Danielle.

919
01:08:30,078 --> 01:08:31,911
- Yeah, the one you've
been too afraid to talk

920
01:08:31,913 --> 01:08:33,881
to the past couple of months.

921
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:37,250
- I haven't been afraid, I just
didn't have anything to say.

922
01:08:38,418 --> 01:08:40,251
- Well, that's good
because these somehow

923
01:08:40,253 --> 01:08:41,889
got in the wrong section

924
01:08:43,091 --> 01:08:44,991
and you can bring them
to her for revamping.

925
01:08:44,993 --> 01:08:45,891
- Want me to bring them?

926
01:08:45,893 --> 01:08:46,592
- I do.

927
01:08:46,594 --> 01:08:47,392
- Okay.

928
01:08:47,394 --> 01:08:47,927
- Right over there.

929
01:08:47,929 --> 01:08:49,227
- She's over there?

930
01:08:49,229 --> 01:08:50,230
- All right.

931
01:08:51,398 --> 01:08:52,432
- You can do it.

932
01:08:56,436 --> 01:09:00,675
- Hey, pastor Vanessa wanted
me to hand these to you.

933
01:09:00,775 --> 01:09:04,846
- Okay, did you say
what to do with them?

934
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:11,686
- Just label them or
unlabel them or something.

935
01:09:11,853 --> 01:09:13,986
- Okay, you can put
them right there.

936
01:09:13,988 --> 01:09:14,654
- Put them over here.

937
01:09:14,656 --> 01:09:15,422
Yeah, okay.

938
01:09:16,524 --> 01:09:17,257
I cannot believe
I just did that.

939
01:09:17,525 --> 01:09:18,090
I'm so sorry.

940
01:09:18,092 --> 01:09:18,693
- It's okay.

941
01:09:18,926 --> 01:09:20,225
- Hold on a minute.

942
01:09:20,227 --> 01:09:21,527
- I got it, I got
it, don't, it's fine.

943
01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:22,530
- You sure?

944
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:24,664
I'm such an idiot, I'm sorry.

945
01:09:24,666 --> 01:09:26,034
- You're fine.

946
01:09:26,534 --> 01:09:27,867
- Oh man, I'm sorry.

947
01:09:27,869 --> 01:09:28,868
- Yeah, it's fine.

948
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:31,438
- Okay, all right, okay.

949
01:09:33,675 --> 01:09:35,043
- I'm Scott, by the way.

950
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:36,778
- I know.

951
01:09:49,724 --> 01:09:50,692
- That's awesome.

952
01:09:51,893 --> 01:09:53,793
Pastor Dave, which light
did you say needed?

953
01:09:53,795 --> 01:09:55,730
- Yes, sir, come here.

954
01:09:56,564 --> 01:09:57,395
Yes, sir.

955
01:09:57,397 --> 01:09:58,566
Yeah, that's great.

956
01:10:00,068 --> 01:10:01,268
All right.

957
01:10:01,401 --> 01:10:02,267
All right, thank you so much.

958
01:10:02,269 --> 01:10:04,038
All right, we'll see you then.

959
01:10:05,807 --> 01:10:07,075
That was the prison Scott.

960
01:10:08,976 --> 01:10:10,208
No, nothing bad.

961
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:12,080
They approved our request.

962
01:10:13,047 --> 01:10:13,915
- What request?

963
01:10:13,981 --> 01:10:16,414
- I kind of made a
request for you and I

964
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:18,251
to go minister to the inmates.

965
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:21,987
- We minister to the prisoners?

966
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:23,157
- I sure hope so.

967
01:10:25,593 --> 01:10:26,259
- What about me?

968
01:10:26,761 --> 01:10:28,661
I mean, are they gonna let
a convicted felon in there?

969
01:10:28,663 --> 01:10:29,762
I asked them about that

970
01:10:29,764 --> 01:10:31,599
and they just want you to
fill out an application.

971
01:10:33,167 --> 01:10:34,401
God's got a plan Scott,

972
01:10:35,435 --> 01:10:38,773
no rule of man can
deny that purpose.

973
01:10:39,107 --> 01:10:39,841
He's still calls the shots.

974
01:10:40,273 --> 01:10:43,276
Remember, I'm optimistic
enough for both of us.

975
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:45,278
They're gonna email
us the applications.

976
01:10:47,181 --> 01:10:47,947
- That's great.

977
01:10:47,949 --> 01:10:48,583
- Yeah.

978
01:11:06,601 --> 01:11:08,202
- Had a
great time today.

979
01:11:08,536 --> 01:11:11,170
It was fun hanging with you
and thanks for the help.

980
01:11:11,172 --> 01:11:13,775
Sweet dreams, Danielle.

981
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:25,887
- I had a really
good time with you to.

982
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:28,220
If you ever need someone
to fold your clothes,

983
01:11:28,222 --> 01:11:29,722
I am your man.

984
01:11:32,226 --> 01:11:35,395
There's something you probably
need to know about me.

985
01:12:19,841 --> 01:12:21,406
- Surprise.

986
01:12:21,408 --> 01:12:22,641
- What are we doing here?

987
01:12:22,643 --> 01:12:25,144
- Well, the good news is,

988
01:12:25,146 --> 01:12:28,182
they've approved the first part
of your application process.

989
01:12:29,517 --> 01:12:36,423
Today, they just wanna talk,
it's okay, we're early.

990
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:39,193
Just take a deep
breath, it's all good.

991
01:12:41,428 --> 01:12:43,698
Hey, by the way,
how'd the date go?

992
01:12:46,868 --> 01:12:47,702
- What date?

993
01:12:48,603 --> 01:12:50,705
- What date he says, come on.

994
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:53,107
- You know about the date?

995
01:12:54,709 --> 01:12:57,444
- You know, the best way to
spread gossip in a church.

996
01:12:57,712 --> 01:13:01,180
Telephone telegram, tele
deacon, the small church, Scott.

997
01:13:01,182 --> 01:13:02,683
Everybody knows.

998
01:13:04,585 --> 01:13:05,784
- She's amazing isn't she?

999
01:13:05,786 --> 01:13:06,453
She's amazing.

1000
01:13:06,787 --> 01:13:10,291
- I know, she's funny,
smart, pretty, godly.

1001
01:13:12,827 --> 01:13:14,262
I'm gonna marry her.

1002
01:13:16,964 --> 01:13:18,465
- Should I be worried Scott?

1003
01:13:18,799 --> 01:13:20,801
- No, God told me to do it.

1004
01:13:21,302 --> 01:13:22,469
- Not hearing voices are you?

1005
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:28,040
- No, no, actually, before
Bible study last night

1006
01:13:28,042 --> 01:13:31,143
I asked God, I said,
please just give me a sign

1007
01:13:31,145 --> 01:13:33,779
that she's the woman for me.

1008
01:13:33,781 --> 01:13:37,652
Let her show up with a red
bow in her hair or something.

1009
01:13:39,486 --> 01:13:40,619
- That's pretty specific.

1010
01:13:40,621 --> 01:13:41,656
- It is, but you
wanna know something?

1011
01:13:41,789 --> 01:13:42,657
- What?

1012
01:13:43,157 --> 01:13:45,326
- She showed up last night
with a red bow in her hair?

1013
01:13:45,492 --> 01:13:45,991
- No way.

1014
01:13:45,993 --> 01:13:46,859
- Yes she did.

1015
01:13:46,861 --> 01:13:47,993
- You gotta be kidding.

1016
01:13:47,995 --> 01:13:49,328
- Yeah, I told you.

1017
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:50,229
- That's amazing.

1018
01:13:50,231 --> 01:13:51,832
- I'm gonna marry her.

1019
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:55,836
- That's awesome.

1020
01:14:00,174 --> 01:14:02,510
Hey question.

1021
01:14:02,743 --> 01:14:04,812
Does she know about?

1022
01:14:05,746 --> 01:14:08,749
- Yeah, I told her everything.

1023
01:14:10,751 --> 01:14:11,585
- And?

1024
01:14:13,054 --> 01:14:15,721
- She said, if God says
you're clean, you're clean.

1025
01:14:15,723 --> 01:14:17,091
That's good enough for me.

1026
01:14:20,428 --> 01:14:23,097
- Now that's the response
of a godly woman.

1027
01:14:25,099 --> 01:14:28,767
- Proverbs 31, good woman
is worth more than rubies.

1028
01:14:28,769 --> 01:14:30,571
- Amen to that.

1029
01:14:34,342 --> 01:14:36,110
- it's time.

1030
01:14:37,445 --> 01:14:38,946
No handcuffs today my brother,

1031
01:14:40,114 --> 01:14:41,749
they just wanna interview you.

1032
01:14:42,016 --> 01:14:42,750
Okay.

1033
01:14:43,617 --> 01:14:44,618
They just wanna talk, ready?

1034
01:14:56,263 --> 01:14:57,563
Morning, everyone.

1035
01:14:57,565 --> 01:14:58,430
- Morning.

1036
01:14:58,432 --> 01:14:59,298
- How's everybody doing?

1037
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,134
- Good.

1038
01:15:00,267 --> 01:15:01,969
- Thank you all for
being here this morning.

1039
01:15:02,269 --> 01:15:05,204
I brought my lovely wife,
pastor Vanessa up here with me

1040
01:15:05,206 --> 01:15:08,275
because we have a special
announcement today.

1041
01:15:09,443 --> 01:15:12,878
Matthew 19:26 tells
us that with God,

1042
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,580
all things are possible.

1043
01:15:14,582 --> 01:15:17,182
Things like turning our
lives completely around,

1044
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:20,586
going from hopelessness
to giving hope to others

1045
01:15:20,588 --> 01:15:22,388
who are in the exact
spot we once were.

1046
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:23,856
- We serve almighty
God, don't we?

1047
01:15:23,858 --> 01:15:25,457
- Yes.

1048
01:15:25,459 --> 01:15:26,394
- We do.

1049
01:15:27,728 --> 01:15:30,698
Well yesterday I received
a certified letter

1050
01:15:31,599 --> 01:15:33,234
from the correctional facility.

1051
01:15:35,236 --> 01:15:37,972
Danielle, would
you do the honors?

1052
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:54,255
- Dear pastor Gargano,

1053
01:15:54,922 --> 01:15:56,724
we are pleased to inform
you that your congregant,

1054
01:15:57,258 --> 01:15:59,091
Scott Hieberger
has been approved

1055
01:15:59,093 --> 01:16:02,229
for the prison ministry program
with Road to Life Church.

1056
01:16:02,663 --> 01:16:04,899
We look forward to receiving
him into our facility.

1057
01:16:14,509 --> 01:16:17,678
- Thank you, are you
kidding me, what?

1058
01:16:30,525 --> 01:16:33,058
Thank you so much,
this is such an honor.

1059
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:34,927
This is literally the
greatest day of my whole life.

1060
01:16:34,929 --> 01:16:35,861
Amen, right?

1061
01:16:35,863 --> 01:16:37,198
Amen, wow.

1062
01:16:55,716 --> 01:16:56,717
Hey morning.

1063
01:16:59,887 --> 01:17:01,222
- Get your turn around.

1064
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:04,291
- Thank you.

1065
01:17:05,793 --> 01:17:07,527
- And he said it to Moses,

1066
01:17:07,529 --> 01:17:11,296
I, my father-in-law,
am come unto thee,

1067
01:17:11,298 --> 01:17:14,133
And my wife and her two
sons, thy kingdom come,

1068
01:17:14,135 --> 01:17:16,536
thy will be done will
be done on earth.

1069
01:17:16,538 --> 01:17:18,706
- On earth
as it is in heaven.

1070
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:20,708
- Give us each day
our daily bread.

1071
01:17:20,808 --> 01:17:21,707
Wanna walk with him, okay?

1072
01:17:21,709 --> 01:17:22,810
You wanna walk with him?

1073
01:17:23,711 --> 01:17:24,712
Step by step, walk with him.

1074
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:27,146
Don't ever turn
away, all things.

1075
01:17:27,148 --> 01:17:29,717
Okay, and when he's your
physician, you go to him,

1076
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:31,485
you have a problem,
you go to him.

1077
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:33,487
Some times are thinking, why?

1078
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:36,488
Why, but that's not the
question that we need to ask.

1079
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:38,991
We need to actually say
thank you, I understand.

1080
01:17:38,993 --> 01:17:40,560
I understand.

1081
01:17:40,562 --> 01:17:42,494
- Okay, got one for you.

1082
01:17:42,496 --> 01:17:45,230
Who was the greatest
financier on the Bible?

1083
01:17:45,232 --> 01:17:46,400
- I have no idea.

1084
01:17:46,834 --> 01:17:48,734
- Noah, he was
floating his stock

1085
01:17:48,736 --> 01:17:51,172
while everyone else
was in liquidation.

1086
01:17:51,839 --> 01:17:55,075
- All, right, all right,
now that is a good one.

1087
01:17:56,410 --> 01:18:00,181
- So that kind of
reminds me of you though.

1088
01:18:02,584 --> 01:18:03,851
- Why is that?

1089
01:18:04,084 --> 01:18:06,820
- Well, Noah listened to God
and fulfilled his purpose.

1090
01:18:07,221 --> 01:18:08,923
It's exactly what
you've done Scott.

1091
01:18:09,089 --> 01:18:10,424
I'm really proud of you.

1092
01:18:10,559 --> 01:18:12,927
- It's not me, God's
doing all the work here.

1093
01:18:14,128 --> 01:18:15,763
- Yeah, well what a
work he's doing, man,

1094
01:18:16,163 --> 01:18:16,931
how many today?

1095
01:18:18,265 --> 01:18:20,569
- 438 in attendance, sir.

1096
01:18:20,768 --> 01:18:22,102
Three walked the aisle.

1097
01:18:24,939 --> 01:18:25,674
- That is amazing.

1098
01:18:26,941 --> 01:18:29,910
Hey, keep going, keep
up the good work.

1099
01:18:30,277 --> 01:18:32,947
- I plan on it, as a matter
of fact, we're reaching out,

1100
01:18:33,113 --> 01:18:34,848
seeing if we can get into the
juvenile detention center.

1101
01:18:34,915 --> 01:18:35,684
- Wow.

1102
01:18:35,883 --> 01:18:38,085
- Because maybe if we
can get them young,

1103
01:18:38,786 --> 01:18:39,920
they won't never end up here.

1104
01:18:41,789 --> 01:18:43,121
- Look, if there's anything

1105
01:18:43,123 --> 01:18:46,126
that I can do for you,
any way I can help,

1106
01:18:46,293 --> 01:18:47,629
you gotta let me know, okay.

1107
01:18:48,095 --> 01:18:49,631
- I already put in
the application.

1108
01:18:49,964 --> 01:18:51,633
We're just waiting to hear back.

1109
01:18:51,799 --> 01:18:54,368
- Of course, great.

1110
01:19:05,045 --> 01:19:06,213
- All right, thank you.

1111
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:10,217
- Hey.

1112
01:19:10,284 --> 01:19:10,951
- Hey.

1113
01:19:14,623 --> 01:19:16,455
I'm sorry, we have a problem.

1114
01:19:16,457 --> 01:19:17,889
- Everything okay?

1115
01:19:17,891 --> 01:19:19,559
- Your pass has been revoked.

1116
01:19:19,561 --> 01:19:23,230
- But you know me, I
preach here every week.

1117
01:19:23,531 --> 01:19:25,567
- I'm sorry to inform you
that it's been revoked

1118
01:19:25,734 --> 01:19:28,068
and you no longer have
access to this facility.

1119
01:19:29,303 --> 01:19:30,070
- Why?

1120
01:19:30,572 --> 01:19:31,573
- You have a warrant
for your arrest.

1121
01:19:44,586 --> 01:19:45,654
- It's outta Florida.

1122
01:19:46,987 --> 01:19:48,856
Some old trouble I
had from years ago.

1123
01:19:49,724 --> 01:19:50,659
- And it just now popped up.

1124
01:19:52,059 --> 01:19:55,093
- Yes, when I applied for access
at the juvenile detention.

1125
01:19:55,095 --> 01:19:58,096
- I don't understand if you
had a warrant for your arrest,

1126
01:19:58,098 --> 01:19:59,768
then why didn't they arrest you?

1127
01:20:02,169 --> 01:20:04,071
- Florida won't
extradite this far.

1128
01:20:07,742 --> 01:20:08,940
- Okay, so if they
won't arrest you,

1129
01:20:08,942 --> 01:20:11,445
then why won't they let
you back in the prison?

1130
01:20:12,614 --> 01:20:14,179
- As long as I have
a felony warrant,

1131
01:20:14,181 --> 01:20:15,082
I'm disqualified for entering

1132
01:20:15,182 --> 01:20:17,117
any correctional
facility in the state.

1133
01:20:19,286 --> 01:20:20,187
Isn't that ironic?

1134
01:20:21,589 --> 01:20:23,455
I spent my whole life
fighting to stay outta prison

1135
01:20:23,457 --> 01:20:24,592
and now they won't
let me back in.

1136
01:20:25,959 --> 01:20:28,362
- You go knock over
a liquor store.

1137
01:20:29,296 --> 01:20:30,464
I'm kidding.

1138
01:20:31,265 --> 01:20:31,865
- This is serious.

1139
01:20:32,966 --> 01:20:34,268
If Scott isn't
allowed back inside,

1140
01:20:34,468 --> 01:20:37,371
then everything he's
worked for is gone.

1141
01:20:38,606 --> 01:20:40,441
- So what are our options?

1142
01:20:43,477 --> 01:20:47,649
- I can either quit the
prison ministry altogether,

1143
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:52,821
or I can go to Florida,

1144
01:20:54,288 --> 01:20:57,991
turn myself in and take
care of the warrant.

1145
01:20:59,326 --> 01:21:03,163
- Turn yourself in,
what happens then?

1146
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:06,801
- It's up to the judge.

1147
01:21:07,802 --> 01:21:09,403
- Worst case scenario?

1148
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:10,572
- With what I've done.

1149
01:21:12,741 --> 01:21:14,709
Looking at the
possibility of 20 years.

1150
01:21:15,577 --> 01:21:16,743
- Okay.

1151
01:21:16,745 --> 01:21:19,246
It's a little overwhelming,
but we can't forget

1152
01:21:19,413 --> 01:21:22,216
we serve a big God
and we don't stop

1153
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:24,418
at overwhelming, period.

1154
01:21:24,652 --> 01:21:27,589
So what we do, we pray.

1155
01:21:31,225 --> 01:21:33,227
Oh gracious heavenly Father.

1156
01:21:33,427 --> 01:21:36,096
We ask you father for your
guidance in this dark hour.

1157
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:39,099
- All right guys.

1158
01:21:39,366 --> 01:21:41,101
So Scott recorded a
video message for us.

1159
01:21:41,402 --> 01:21:42,102
You guys ready to see it?

1160
01:21:42,436 --> 01:21:43,103
- Yeah.

1161
01:21:52,747 --> 01:21:54,783
- Hey, what's up guys.

1162
01:21:54,849 --> 01:21:55,981
As you no doubt
have already heard,

1163
01:21:55,983 --> 01:21:57,416
the reason why I'm
not there in person

1164
01:21:57,418 --> 01:21:58,450
and I'm sending you this video

1165
01:21:58,452 --> 01:22:02,590
is because I'm on
my way to prison.

1166
01:22:03,357 --> 01:22:05,527
Something foolish
I did years ago

1167
01:22:05,693 --> 01:22:06,694
has finally caught up with me

1168
01:22:07,227 --> 01:22:11,331
and rather than run from it
like I've done my whole life,

1169
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:17,204
I've decided that this time,
I wanna put it in God's hands.

1170
01:22:19,874 --> 01:22:20,708
I'll see you soon.

1171
01:22:27,849 --> 01:22:29,717
I might be spending the next
20 years behind the wire.

1172
01:22:29,851 --> 01:22:31,719
But if that's what God
has in store for me,

1173
01:22:31,886 --> 01:22:33,053
I'm willing to accept it.

1174
01:22:34,789 --> 01:22:36,457
Don't be upset.

1175
01:22:36,691 --> 01:22:38,358
Hey, the apostle Paul
did some amazing things

1176
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,728
while he was incarcerated
and we can too.

1177
01:22:42,062 --> 01:22:43,063
Okay, come on.

1178
01:22:49,303 --> 01:22:51,371
- We're gonna all be
down for the trial.

1179
01:22:51,806 --> 01:22:56,241
And pastor Dave wanted me
to tell you that the church

1180
01:22:56,243 --> 01:22:59,077
is gonna keep paying
you all you're away.

1181
01:22:59,079 --> 01:23:00,378
So you don't have
to worry about bills

1182
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:01,583
piling up and all that.

1183
01:23:04,384 --> 01:23:05,219
I love you.

1184
01:23:06,721 --> 01:23:08,155
- I love you too.

1185
01:23:57,337 --> 01:23:58,873
- I don't know
what's gonna happen.

1186
01:23:59,106 --> 01:24:02,209
All I know is God has a
plan and it's perfect.

1187
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:04,278
I spent too many years
trying to do things my way.

1188
01:24:04,779 --> 01:24:06,246
Now it's time to
do things his way.

1189
01:24:07,949 --> 01:24:11,184
You guys pray for me and I'll
be praying for all of you.

1190
01:24:12,286 --> 01:24:13,120
God bless.

1191
01:24:15,757 --> 01:24:17,190
Thanks again for
picking me up, dad.

1192
01:24:17,457 --> 01:24:18,458
- Ah, no worries.

1193
01:24:20,929 --> 01:24:23,531
Still can't believe
that's all you brought.

1194
01:24:23,798 --> 01:24:25,700
- Where I'm going, I'm
not gonna need much.

1195
01:24:25,767 --> 01:24:28,536
- I guess you got that right,
are you a little hungry?

1196
01:24:28,803 --> 01:24:30,304
- Yeah.

1197
01:24:30,638 --> 01:24:32,306
- Well, let's go get
something to eat.

1198
01:24:32,807 --> 01:24:34,441
- Okay.

1199
01:24:35,442 --> 01:24:37,142
- You know, I almost
didn't answer the phone

1200
01:24:37,144 --> 01:24:38,145
when you called.

1201
01:24:39,313 --> 01:24:41,148
- I wouldn't have blamed
you if you hadn't.

1202
01:24:41,448 --> 01:24:45,319
I did some terrible things
to you and mom and everybody.

1203
01:24:46,219 --> 01:24:47,454
I'm sorry, dad.

1204
01:24:47,822 --> 01:24:50,290
- When you called and
asked for a ride to prison,

1205
01:24:50,324 --> 01:24:52,159
I thought sure you
were drunk again.

1206
01:24:52,627 --> 01:24:55,162
- I could see why.

1207
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:02,804
- You sure you wanna do
this, turn yourself in?

1208
01:25:03,838 --> 01:25:05,238
- I am.

1209
01:25:05,405 --> 01:25:08,910
I'm submitting myself to
God's will now, not my own.

1210
01:25:09,644 --> 01:25:11,411
- Proud of you son.

1211
01:25:12,547 --> 01:25:13,380
- Thanks dad.

1212
01:25:17,085 --> 01:25:18,553
- Let me buy you a real meal.

1213
01:25:19,754 --> 01:25:20,588
- Sounds good.

1214
01:25:28,096 --> 01:25:29,931
- Fill that out and
turn it back in.

1215
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:33,601
Hi.

1216
01:25:33,901 --> 01:25:35,670
- I'm here to turn
myself in for a warrant.

1217
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:37,237
- Spelling on the last name.

1218
01:25:37,772 --> 01:25:40,942
- HIGHBERGER.

1219
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:43,276
Highberger, Scott.

1220
01:25:51,686 --> 01:25:53,788
- Get some back up
here to the front desk.

1221
01:26:03,798 --> 01:26:05,533
Sir, stay right
there, don't move.

1222
01:26:06,701 --> 01:26:09,503
- Sir, turn around,
hands behind your back.

1223
01:26:25,252 --> 01:26:28,253
- Mr. Highberger, I'm
Levi Watts, your attorney.

1224
01:26:28,255 --> 01:26:29,724
- Pleasure.

1225
01:26:30,024 --> 01:26:31,724
- This is a first, I've
never been hired by a church

1226
01:26:31,726 --> 01:26:33,695
on a criminal proceeding before.

1227
01:26:33,895 --> 01:26:35,563
- They're a great
group of people.

1228
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:37,264
- Okay, let's get to it.

1229
01:26:37,632 --> 01:26:39,534
I think our best defense
is to plead not guilty.

1230
01:26:39,734 --> 01:26:41,135
Then ask for a reduced bond

1231
01:26:41,401 --> 01:26:43,403
until you're trial, while
we're waiting I can.

1232
01:26:43,638 --> 01:26:44,739
- I'm gonna plead guilty.

1233
01:26:46,074 --> 01:26:46,974
- I'm sorry.

1234
01:26:48,408 --> 01:26:49,711
- I'm guilty.

1235
01:26:50,277 --> 01:26:51,977
I did all the things that
they're accusing me of.

1236
01:26:51,979 --> 01:26:54,414
So I'm guilty.

1237
01:26:55,883 --> 01:26:58,984
- Scott, with your record,
pleading guilty would ensure.

1238
01:26:58,986 --> 01:27:00,287
I know, I know,

1239
01:27:01,089 --> 01:27:04,659
I've done a lot of
terrible things in my life

1240
01:27:05,626 --> 01:27:09,797
and now it's time to pay for it.

1241
01:27:10,665 --> 01:27:11,463
- Well, I don't think the church

1242
01:27:11,465 --> 01:27:12,832
is going to paying
me just to help

1243
01:27:12,834 --> 01:27:13,632
put you back by it's bars.

1244
01:27:13,634 --> 01:27:14,401
It|s okay.

1245
01:27:15,636 --> 01:27:17,805
- We're gonna put it
in God's hands now.

1246
01:27:18,338 --> 01:27:20,139
- Well, that's good because
if you plead guilty,

1247
01:27:20,141 --> 01:27:21,642
it's certainly out of mine.

1248
01:27:22,744 --> 01:27:23,578
- I know.

1249
01:27:26,681 --> 01:27:30,850
- All right, we'll offer them
a year and see if they bite,

1250
01:27:30,852 --> 01:27:33,353
but don't hold your breath.

1251
01:27:34,989 --> 01:27:35,823
- It's okay.

1252
01:27:49,503 --> 01:27:50,370
Highberger, you're up.

1253
01:27:56,110 --> 01:27:57,377
- Good luck, preacher boy.

1254
01:28:11,526 --> 01:28:16,531
- All rise, court
is now in session.

1255
01:28:17,932 --> 01:28:19,801
The honorable judge,
William Palmer presiding.

1256
01:28:24,872 --> 01:28:25,807
- Please be seated

1257
01:28:32,379 --> 01:28:35,983
in the case of the state of
Florida versus Scott Highberger,

1258
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:38,619
counselor, am I to understand
your client has made it known

1259
01:28:38,953 --> 01:28:40,655
he wishes to enter
a plea of guilty?

1260
01:28:43,624 --> 01:28:45,392
- He does your honor.

1261
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:48,395
- Is he aware of
the ramifications
venting such a plea?

1262
01:28:51,232 --> 01:28:52,667
- He is your honor.

1263
01:28:54,068 --> 01:28:57,004
- How refreshing, someone
who's actually willing

1264
01:28:57,138 --> 01:29:02,176
to save the taxpayer's little
time and money, very well.

1265
01:29:02,510 --> 01:29:04,178
What is the state's
recommendation?

1266
01:29:05,713 --> 01:29:09,081
Your honor, considering the
extensive criminal history

1267
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:10,417
of the defendant,

1268
01:29:11,085 --> 01:29:13,888
which includes numerous
and violent felonies,

1269
01:29:14,421 --> 01:29:17,424
the state recommends the maximum
of 20 years on each count

1270
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:20,427
to run consecutively.

1271
01:29:23,097 --> 01:29:25,598
- What does he mean by
that, to run consecutively?

1272
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,068
You means one after another.

1273
01:29:27,168 --> 01:29:28,069
- Your honor.

1274
01:29:28,169 --> 01:29:31,072
- He'll be in jail for
the rest of his life.

1275
01:29:31,606 --> 01:29:32,271
Yes counsel.

1276
01:29:32,273 --> 01:29:33,774
- I know.

1277
01:29:34,108 --> 01:29:36,443
- Before judgment is entered,

1278
01:29:36,744 --> 01:29:39,113
the defense would request
that his honor be made aware

1279
01:29:39,446 --> 01:29:42,116
of several letters and
statements that have been made

1280
01:29:42,183 --> 01:29:43,284
on behalf of the accused.

1281
01:29:43,618 --> 01:29:47,788
They address the changed nature
of my client, that we pray

1282
01:29:47,855 --> 01:29:50,623
the court would take
into consideration.

1283
01:29:50,625 --> 01:29:51,458
- Very well.

1284
01:29:51,792 --> 01:29:54,128
As long as we don't turn
this into an all day affair.

1285
01:29:55,462 --> 01:29:56,631
- Thank you, your honor.

1286
01:30:00,134 --> 01:30:01,302
- Anytime we were dispatched

1287
01:30:01,468 --> 01:30:03,636
to a call involving
Scott Highberger,

1288
01:30:03,638 --> 01:30:05,472
we knew we were in for a fight,

1289
01:30:05,873 --> 01:30:09,141
but now I can honestly
say he's a changed man.

1290
01:30:09,143 --> 01:30:12,378
Now we love seeing him walk
into the Sheriff's department.

1291
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:14,613
- Scott is one of the few
Christians I identified

1292
01:30:14,615 --> 01:30:17,985
as being serious concerning
his walk with God.

1293
01:30:18,219 --> 01:30:20,453
My interactions and
communications with him

1294
01:30:20,487 --> 01:30:23,991
showed me his love
of the Lord was real.

1295
01:30:24,058 --> 01:30:27,128
And I believe him, I believe
him to be a changed man.

1296
01:30:28,529 --> 01:30:31,666
- Scott has become so
instrumental to our church.

1297
01:30:31,832 --> 01:30:34,001
I don't know how we ever
get along without him

1298
01:30:34,335 --> 01:30:36,003
or how we will get
along without him.

1299
01:30:40,908 --> 01:30:45,913
- Scott is absolutely wonderful,

1300
01:30:47,848 --> 01:30:50,685
been a real role
model for my children.

1301
01:30:53,321 --> 01:30:55,022
I don't know what
we do without him.

1302
01:30:59,193 --> 01:31:03,030
- Judge, I gotta tell you
that Scott growing up,

1303
01:31:03,164 --> 01:31:06,100
he wasn't a good kid and
he got progressively worse

1304
01:31:06,267 --> 01:31:07,835
as the years went by,

1305
01:31:08,102 --> 01:31:10,438
caused me a lot of grief
and a loss of sleep.

1306
01:31:11,572 --> 01:31:14,909
There was even a
time, God forgive me,

1307
01:31:15,009 --> 01:31:17,778
but I prayed that the next
cruiser to pull in the drive

1308
01:31:18,012 --> 01:31:20,681
was there to tell me,
Scott's never coming home.

1309
01:31:22,283 --> 01:31:27,288
But now, now I'm proud
to call him my son.

1310
01:31:31,959 --> 01:31:32,793
I love you, Scott.

1311
01:31:38,132 --> 01:31:39,567
- Scott has reached
thousands of inmates

1312
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:42,368
with his prison ministry,
it's just simply astounding.

1313
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:43,936
And your honor,

1314
01:31:43,938 --> 01:31:46,974
I have hundreds of letters
here on Scott's behalf.

1315
01:31:47,108 --> 01:31:49,477
If it's okay, I would
love to just read a few.

1316
01:31:50,644 --> 01:31:55,316
Thanks to Scott and
the prison ministry,

1317
01:31:55,583 --> 01:31:58,285
I finally see the
opportunity to forgive myself

1318
01:31:58,386 --> 01:32:01,889
and feel the light and
love of Jesus Christ.

1319
01:32:02,156 --> 01:32:05,159
Scott has been a real
inspiration to me.

1320
01:32:05,326 --> 01:32:06,394
I admire that he
had the strength

1321
01:32:06,594 --> 01:32:09,397
to walk away from his old life.

1322
01:32:09,597 --> 01:32:11,597
He has the kindness to
welcome his old friends

1323
01:32:11,599 --> 01:32:15,701
into his new life, but the
courage to stay away from them

1324
01:32:15,703 --> 01:32:18,606
if they want to drag him
down to his old place.

1325
01:32:20,374 --> 01:32:22,076
Here's another one, your honor.

1326
01:32:23,244 --> 01:32:26,247
I've been down 13 years
when I was 11 years old,

1327
01:32:26,313 --> 01:32:29,617
I was in a graveyard
and read these words

1328
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:32,920
on a stone, where you are,

1329
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:37,425
I once was, where I
am, you'll soon be.

1330
01:32:38,092 --> 01:32:40,628
I've never forgotten
those words.

1331
01:32:40,761 --> 01:32:42,630
I want what Scott has.

1332
01:32:44,665 --> 01:32:46,500
If it had not been for Scott,

1333
01:32:46,834 --> 01:32:49,737
I would still be on the
streets, getting into trouble.

1334
01:32:49,937 --> 01:32:52,638
Scott showed me a brand
new way to live life.

1335
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:55,443
No more drugs, no more crime.

1336
01:32:55,643 --> 01:32:57,645
I'm alive today because of him.

1337
01:32:58,946 --> 01:33:03,651
I am what Scott was and
he is what I want to be.

1338
01:33:07,822 --> 01:33:09,188
And that's just a few again,

1339
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:12,527
from the hundreds of
letters that we received,

1340
01:33:23,037 --> 01:33:24,705
nothing further, your honor.

1341
01:33:29,043 --> 01:33:30,175
- Would you please bring me

1342
01:33:30,177 --> 01:33:31,879
the defendant's
criminal history?

1343
01:33:40,387 --> 01:33:41,222
- Thank you.

1344
01:33:59,541 --> 01:34:01,909
- Quite the checkered past.

1345
01:34:04,546 --> 01:34:06,147
I have one question for you son.

1346
01:34:07,314 --> 01:34:08,949
Since you've been
spending all this time

1347
01:34:09,717 --> 01:34:10,484
preaching behind bars,

1348
01:34:10,985 --> 01:34:14,955
telling people to
accept responsibility
for their actions,

1349
01:34:16,457 --> 01:34:18,792
why have you not taken
care of this warrant?

1350
01:34:24,965 --> 01:34:25,966
- Just be honest.

1351
01:34:36,744 --> 01:34:39,747
- I was scared your honor.

1352
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:51,025
- I guess I was just hoping
that it would go away

1353
01:34:54,195 --> 01:34:58,866
so that I wouldn't
be held accountable.

1354
01:35:07,107 --> 01:35:09,274
- This court will
take a short recess

1355
01:35:09,276 --> 01:35:11,245
while I weigh my
decision on sentencing.

1356
01:36:20,247 --> 01:36:22,715
Mr Highberger,
earlier I asked you

1357
01:36:22,717 --> 01:36:23,915
why you had not taken care

1358
01:36:23,917 --> 01:36:26,920
of this outstanding warrant
here in the state of Florida.

1359
01:36:28,389 --> 01:36:30,759
Your answer plain and simple
was that you were afraid.

1360
01:36:33,427 --> 01:36:36,163
You do realize that
Jonah felt the same, yes?

1361
01:36:37,931 --> 01:36:39,933
He didn't want to go to Ninivah,

1362
01:36:41,435 --> 01:36:42,604
So God sent a giant whale

1363
01:36:43,003 --> 01:36:46,106
to swallow him up
and drag him there.

1364
01:36:48,576 --> 01:36:50,444
I sir am your giant whale.

1365
01:36:53,515 --> 01:36:57,786
I hold in my hand a plea
agreement you have signed,

1366
01:36:58,952 --> 01:37:02,923
offering to do 14
months in prison.

1367
01:37:04,124 --> 01:37:06,160
The state wants you to
do considerably more.

1368
01:37:07,194 --> 01:37:08,362
I cannot in good conscience

1369
01:37:08,596 --> 01:37:10,497
accept your terms,
Mr. Highberger.

1370
01:37:11,899 --> 01:37:14,368
This court has the
authority to either accept

1371
01:37:14,536 --> 01:37:16,705
or reject any negotiated pleas.

1372
01:37:17,905 --> 01:37:21,909
And I have elected to
not accept this one.

1373
01:37:29,917 --> 01:37:34,121
So if you mean to move
forward with your plea,

1374
01:37:34,221 --> 01:37:37,925
I want you to know I am not
going to have my hands tied.

1375
01:37:40,394 --> 01:37:41,730
Gonna ask you one more time.

1376
01:37:43,964 --> 01:37:47,301
Do you still wish to
enter a guilty plea?

1377
01:37:50,805 --> 01:37:53,706
- Your honor, may I
confer with my client?

1378
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:55,142
- Of course.

1379
01:37:55,943 --> 01:37:57,645
- What's going on?

1380
01:37:58,747 --> 01:38:00,648
- He's rejected
our plea agreement.

1381
01:38:00,715 --> 01:38:03,951
You need to know, know
that if you plead guilty,

1382
01:38:04,952 --> 01:38:06,621
you're basically
signing a blank check.

1383
01:38:09,490 --> 01:38:10,991
- Mr. Highberger.

1384
01:38:14,061 --> 01:38:20,835
♪ Every page before was
a record was a failure ♪

1385
01:38:23,838 --> 01:38:28,674
♪ I was on my knee and you ♪

1386
01:38:28,676 --> 01:38:30,643
- I am guilty, your honor.

1387
01:38:30,645 --> 01:38:32,980
♪ My plea ♪

1388
01:38:36,483 --> 01:38:39,086
- Very well, the court
accepts your plea of guilty.

1389
01:38:43,357 --> 01:38:47,194
Saul was a pretty
dreadful human being

1390
01:38:47,529 --> 01:38:49,864
until he finally saw the light.

1391
01:38:51,265 --> 01:38:54,368
Then he did some mighty fine
work while he was behind bars.

1392
01:38:56,003 --> 01:39:01,008
I think you have too, and
can continue to do so.

1393
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:04,278
I've been on the bench
now for a number of years

1394
01:39:04,846 --> 01:39:08,348
and mostly it's
business as usual.

1395
01:39:09,784 --> 01:39:11,452
Your case though is unique.

1396
01:39:13,788 --> 01:39:17,523
You have made some bad
decisions in your life

1397
01:39:17,525 --> 01:39:19,193
which have led you here.

1398
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:26,133
In your case however, I
don't think incarceration

1399
01:39:26,433 --> 01:39:28,268
is the right answer.

1400
01:39:30,638 --> 01:39:33,140
If you're behind bars, you
may reach a few people,

1401
01:39:34,609 --> 01:39:36,811
but not nearly as many as
you would as a free man.

1402
01:39:38,145 --> 01:39:40,113
God has plans for you son.

1403
01:39:41,315 --> 01:39:49,891
So go make them happen,
this case is dismissed.

1404
01:39:55,329 --> 01:39:57,832
Would one of you come up
and give this boy a hug?
