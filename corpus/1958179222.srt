1
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,613
- I have a secret.

2
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,787
Don't think what
I'm doing is easy.

3
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,292
My sister, 15,

4
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,461
trying so hard to look perfect.

5
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:44,398
She can't see she's
already beautiful.

6
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,436
My mom, she used to
smile all the time.

7
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:50,838
Where did that go?

8
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:55,143
And my dad on his computer.

9
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,476
He always says it's work,

10
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:59,914
but so many times,
it's really not.

11
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:07,622
I'm casting a spell to bake
us back together again,

12
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:08,956
happy and sweet.

13
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:17,965
- You ready to go?

14
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,100
- Almost.

15
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:19,801
- Now we cannot be late, okay?

16
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:20,668
- Okay.

17
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,438
My family can't even see me.

18
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,541
- We have to leave,
like, right now.

19
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:28,208
- But my cookies
aren't done yet.

20
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:29,610
- She just wants
to ruin it for me.

21
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,713
- Come on, Violet, hurry up.

22
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,720
- Oh, yeah, my secret.

23
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:42,857
Sometimes I think I'm a witch.

24
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:00,842
As for that spell,

25
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,611
I said it wasn't easy.

26
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:06,446
And now, I've ruined everything.

27
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,484
- Watch what you wish for.

28
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,089
- It's not making sense.

29
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:16,423
- Should I pull over?

30
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,725
- No, no,
no, keep going.

31
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:20,895
- Said one
lemming to another.

32
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:21,763
- Huh.

33
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,030
- Quit it.

34
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:24,165
- Violet.

35
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,136
- Oh, go, go right at
this traffic circle.

36
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:29,269
- Wait, wh-which right?

37
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,238
There are, like, five choices.

38
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:32,439
Hello? Any clues?

39
00:04:32,507 --> 00:04:33,373
- I give up.

40
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,474
- Typical.

41
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,910
- What is that supposed to mean?

42
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:36,944
- A'right, give me
the phone, I'll do it.

43
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,181
- Can you? Why did
she have to come?

44
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:42,550
- Found it. Thank God for me.

45
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,898
Uh, miss, uh, miss...

46
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,174
I guess that's her, right?

47
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,542
- Yeah.

48
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,947
- Everything is ready for you.

49
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:15,448
- Oh, Adam!

50
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,818
- Yana, how are you?

51
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:17,819
- Good.

52
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:18,853
- Good to see you.

53
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,754
- Savannah.

54
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:20,788
- Hi.

55
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:21,956
- Hi.

56
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:23,691
- And this is Chloe,
Savannah's mom.

57
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:24,592
- Hi.

58
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,633
So nice to finally meet you.

59
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,268
You must be a model too.

60
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,770
- I was, of course,

61
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:38,306
but now Yana is
all about business.

62
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,373
And Yana's business today

63
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,710
is to find a face for her line.

64
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:45,179
So let's go, people! Let's move!

65
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:31,993
- Stop.

66
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,063
- Not much to get excited about.

67
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,731
- I don't know.

68
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,099
This one's pretty special.

69
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:38,893
- Oh my God, Violet.

70
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,695
Outside. Now.

71
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,017
- Ciao.

72
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,254
- Ciao.

73
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,062
- I don't know what that means.

74
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:27,835
- The auction place
where they sell the cows.

75
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:30,104
- There's no cows here.

76
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:31,005
- No?

77
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,043
- That's mean.

78
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,984
- Feel the light, feel
the beautiful light.

79
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:58,299
- Que bello.

80
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,635
I, I'm Daniele.

81
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:02,736
- Violet.

82
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,775
- You not one of them?

83
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:10,344
- No, are you?

84
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:13,080
- Eww, no.

85
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,649
- So why are you here?

86
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:19,753
- Boss lady, she's my matrigna.

87
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,123
- Daniele, what are you doing?

88
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:26,961
Where is my package?
Get inside now.

89
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:32,099
- Stepmother. I,
I, I have to go.

90
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:43,110
- See you, darling.

91
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:46,647
- What?

92
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,985
- Why Savannah?

93
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,319
- Trust me, she'll bring me

94
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:53,588
the key to Paradiso.
- She's not

95
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,989
the face of your collection.

96
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,725
I know what look I
need, and I know...

97
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,628
- Brava, Savannah.

98
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:00,995
Congratulations.
- Uh.

99
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,031
- This is Franco.

100
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:05,266
- Oh, hi, I'm, uh, I'm Adam.

101
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,834
This is my wife, Chloe.

102
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:17,077
- Thank you,
it's all so unexpected.

103
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:19,880
- Savannah has to
look like she's just...

104
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:21,715
- It's about time.

105
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,851
- And who is this little angel?

106
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:25,719
- Oh, the naughty
daughter, Violet.

107
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,121
- Violet.

108
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:29,223
- She could be
a model like her sister.

109
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,358
- Look at this
contract, would you?

110
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:32,259
- Sure.

111
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:35,530
Oh, uh, it's, uh,
it's in Italian.

112
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,366
- Oh, well, that
shouldn't be a problem

113
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,234
for you, right?

114
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:45,739
- Uh, no.

115
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:47,474
Thank you.

116
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:54,915
Come on, you see what
Savannah was wearing today?

117
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,951
I mean, a little slutty.

118
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,052
- That's
what kids wear now.

119
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,453
- For the last time, no!

120
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:02,389
- How come it's fine
for her but not for me?

121
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,825
- Your sister thinks this
is a big opportunity.

122
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,827
I disagree, but she's old enough

123
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,563
to start making
decisions like that.

124
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,764
You on the other hand

125
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,733
aren't quite there yet.

126
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,201
- It's not fair.

127
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:16,036
- When you're 15, if
you still want creeps

128
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,639
like Franco to use your body

129
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:19,039
to sell sleazy clothes, then-

130
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:21,475
- I am not letting
Franco use my body.

131
00:12:21,543 --> 00:12:23,477
- That's what
photographers do.

132
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:24,713
- Hey!
- I know, I know

133
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,213
what photographers do.

134
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,915
That's why I'm taking
time off work tomorrow

135
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:29,316
to make sure he doesn't.

136
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:30,217
- Oh, right.

137
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,654
- What?

138
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:34,021
- Yeah, that's why you're going.

139
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:35,856
- It is.

140
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,660
- I'm not blind.

141
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:50,104
- Listen, honey, we,

142
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,205
we don't ever wanna stop you

143
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:52,707
living the life you wanna live,

144
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,710
but everything has a season.

145
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:56,810
- What's the big deal?

146
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,513
What are you so scared of?

147
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,253
- There's things out there.

148
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:09,356
- Out where?

149
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,793
- Dangerous things
in, in, in the world.

150
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,094
Your, your mother
and I just want you

151
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,063
to, to, to stay safe.

152
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,700
- You mean like
creepy men saying,

153
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:20,000
"Get in my car, little girl.

154
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,569
I'll give you some candy"?

155
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:23,203
- Yes, yes, but
not just stuff like that.

156
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,104
- Then what?

157
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:33,981
- Look, it,
it's, it's like a plug,

158
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,253
a really big one.

159
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,790
- Giant plug?

160
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,558
- Yes, with a chain on it.

161
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:46,728
- What if I open it?

162
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:48,262
- No, no, no, don't do that.

163
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:50,497
Well, the, the whole
world will get sucked down

164
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:53,768
or

165
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,804
bad things could come up.

166
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:00,240
- Like what?

167
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:02,711
What bad things?

168
00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:04,011
- Just don't open it,

169
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:08,415
yet, okay?

170
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:12,219
Come here.

171
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:20,628
Love you, mm. Now,
get outta here.

172
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:40,749
- You could destroy
us, you understand?

173
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:42,349
Now look at me.

174
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:50,023
Feel your power!

175
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,793
A little more to
your left, that's it.

176
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:57,064
Now, okay, okay.
You are a spider.

177
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:58,999
- Eww.

178
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,167
- No, no, you, you're
not really a spider,

179
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:01,603
but you're like a spider.

180
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:04,371
And you eat your
boyfriends for lunch.

181
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:10,043
Okay, listen, it's
a metaphor, darling.

182
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,012
Do you know what a metaphor is?

183
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,348
That's it, that's great.

184
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:15,617
That's great, perfect.

185
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:16,483
Hold that!

186
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:21,088
Okay, show me how
you devour your prey.

187
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:22,189
Show me, I wanna see it.

188
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:23,525
I wanna see it in your face.

189
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:24,491
That's good.

190
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,993
- You know what I mean?

191
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,027
- One foot forward.

192
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,028
Now lean towards me.

193
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,196
- Hey, Mom.

194
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,331
- Hi, you want a gelato?

195
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:34,368
- No, thanks. This is boring.

196
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:35,537
- Oh, if I have to be here,

197
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:36,937
you have to be here.

198
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:44,411
- Can I go for a walk?

199
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,281
- Why don't you just stay here?

200
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,416
- But I wanna see the town.

201
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:54,087
- Don't go outside the
walls, okay? Promise.

202
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:57,659
Promise, Violet.

203
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,931
- Fine, okay. I promise.

204
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,934
- That's
good, you are, uh,

205
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,703
that's incredible.

206
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,604
- Okay, alright.

207
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,541
- Yes.
- That's it, alright.

208
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:25,687
- Ciao.

209
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,958
- Ciao, what are you doing?

210
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,693
- I'm running away.

211
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,494
- To where?

212
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:34,394
- Out there.

213
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,231
- There? There is only forest.

214
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,199
- Sounds good to me.

215
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:41,201
- No, it is not good.

216
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:45,072
A witch sleeps
there, a real one.

217
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,473
- Yeah, right.

218
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,942
- My farm
was there. I know.

219
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,777
- I'd rather take my chances.

220
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:53,313
- Daniele! You're
holding all of us up.

221
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:02,657
- Be careful.

222
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:26,541
- Kill me,
kill me with your eyes.

223
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:27,742
That's it.

224
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:30,177
Now, give him more anger.

225
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:31,579
More anger, I wanna
see more anger.

226
00:18:31,646 --> 00:18:33,280
That's it. No, that's
too much anger.

227
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:34,247
Too much anger.

228
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,282
Yeah, that's it.

229
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,383
- Where's Violet?

230
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,086
- She went for a walk.

231
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,219
- Look at me.

232
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,320
- You let her go on her own?

233
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:41,488
- Your daughter's all by herself

234
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:43,091
in this scary old village

235
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,826
with no big strong
man to protect her.

236
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:47,962
- Yeah, well, you never
know what's out there.

237
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:48,997
- Not so sweet.

238
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:50,531
- She'll be fine.

239
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:58,506
- Put, put, put
one leg over this.

240
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:03,611
- Daniele!

241
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,614
Daniele!

242
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:12,854
Daniele.

243
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,321
- What do you want?

244
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:15,288
- Get off the scooter.

245
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:16,924
- No, my father give it.

246
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:17,759
- Look.

247
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:19,093
- For me.

248
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,863
- Calm down, I
have an idea, okay?

249
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:22,930
- I said no.

250
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,499
- Yana.

251
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:27,735
- Daniele, do what he says.

252
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:30,505
- Okay.

253
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:37,645
- Get off the scooter!

254
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,784
Savannah.

255
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:56,791
- Mother.

256
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,433
You gave me this gift.

257
00:21:08,236 --> 00:21:09,737
The flowers that love me.

258
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:12,740
Is love the key?

259
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:20,982
Speak to me.

260
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:43,171
Why me?

261
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:06,426
Will you teach me?

262
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:13,534
I will listen to you. I promise.

263
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:14,869
- Oh, that's good.

264
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:16,369
Now, move the hair
out of your eye.

265
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:17,238
Yeah, yeah, that's
it, that's it.

266
00:22:17,305 --> 00:22:18,172
A little more.

267
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,274
Okay, head back more.

268
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,408
Put your, put your left hand

269
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:22,677
on the back of the seat there.

270
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:23,744
Nice, nice.

271
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:25,279
- I won't stay here long.

272
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,414
- Well, do you
want me to get off?

273
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,649
- What do you want?

274
00:22:30,718 --> 00:22:32,854
- Ah, nice. You read my mind.

275
00:22:36,324 --> 00:22:37,490
- Hey, Savannah! Hold, Savannah!

276
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:38,793
- Savannah!

277
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,694
- Daniele!

278
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:29,176
- Hello.

279
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:31,178
- Hi, are you the witch?

280
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:40,588
- The
witch or a witch?

281
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:42,523
- A boy told me a
witch lives here.

282
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:47,161
- Oh, my name's
Hazel, what's yours?

283
00:23:47,228 --> 00:23:48,596
- Violet.

284
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:51,599
- Well, Violet, if
you believe everything

285
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,634
that boys tell you,

286
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:55,903
you're gonna have
a very rough life.

287
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:58,906
Oh, meet Delilah.

288
00:24:03,244 --> 00:24:05,112
Wanna see my garden?

289
00:24:06,514 --> 00:24:07,682
- Okay.

290
00:24:23,998 --> 00:24:24,832
Wow.

291
00:24:33,174 --> 00:24:34,241
- Ahh, ahh, ah, no, no.

292
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:37,945
Naked Ladies, very dangerous.

293
00:24:38,012 --> 00:24:39,146
- Dangerous?

294
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:40,047
- Poison.

295
00:24:40,982 --> 00:24:42,149
- And that one?

296
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:45,519
- Oh, Angel's Trumpet,
extremely deadly.

297
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:47,088
- Is everything here poisonous?

298
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,122
- Not everything.

299
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:03,104
- I know these.

300
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,672
They won't hurt me.

301
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:07,742
- Really? Well, it depends
on how you treat them.

302
00:25:10,411 --> 00:25:13,114
- Wow, nice.

303
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,983
- You can have one
if you can reach it.

304
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:34,563
Oh, come on, she's too young.

305
00:26:58,285 --> 00:26:59,386
Well, look who's up.

306
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:00,921
- What happened?

307
00:27:00,988 --> 00:27:02,823
- That apple was too high.

308
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,693
- No, the ladder was too short.

309
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:06,760
- Oh.

310
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:19,740
You hungry?

311
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:21,108
- I guess.

312
00:27:22,343 --> 00:27:24,111
Are these poisonous too?

313
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:26,780
- You're interested in flowers?

314
00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:29,483
- Flowers are interested in me.

315
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:34,121
- Oh, so you know what
flowers are for then?

316
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:37,925
- They aren't for anything.

317
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:39,260
They're just flowers.

318
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:43,397
- They're actually
sexual organs.

319
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:48,202
- Eww.

320
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,506
- There's nothing eww about it.

321
00:27:51,573 --> 00:27:52,439
It's just true.

322
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:58,647
Well, except for those.

323
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:00,714
What you think are their flowers

324
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:01,916
are actually their stomachs.

325
00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:04,018
- Plants don't have stomachs.

326
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:05,753
- They're carnivorous.

327
00:28:10,457 --> 00:28:15,262
They like their meat
fresh and alive.

328
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:26,307
So all alone in the forest.

329
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:30,110
Now, what's that about?

330
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:33,180
- Well, everybody
else was so busy

331
00:28:33,948 --> 00:28:35,149
with my sister.

332
00:28:36,217 --> 00:28:39,286
- And you wish they'd
be busy with you?

333
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:40,854
- No one even sees me.

334
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:42,823
It's like I'm not even there.

335
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:47,596
- Mm, so you
want them to see you

336
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:49,196
like they see your sister?

337
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:52,833
- Not, not exactly.

338
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,504
But why not? Seems like fun.

339
00:28:57,505 --> 00:29:00,007
- Oh, power is always fun.

340
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:02,076
It's just not always safe.

341
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:04,011
- You
sound like my dad.

342
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:08,215
He said, "It was
like a giant plug."

343
00:29:08,282 --> 00:29:09,116
- It?

344
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:13,454
- You know, sex.

345
00:29:14,623 --> 00:29:15,724
He can't talk about it

346
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:17,858
without getting embarrassed.

347
00:29:20,261 --> 00:29:22,229
- You wanna see it for yourself?

348
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:38,513
- Um, how far are we gonna go?

349
00:29:39,246 --> 00:29:41,616
- Well, it's just through there.

350
00:29:41,683 --> 00:29:43,083
- What is?

351
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,787
- Well, go and see.

352
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:13,280
Go on, you'll be fine.

353
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:47,381
- No way.

354
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:16,443
Open it, open it.

355
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:17,878
- Who said that?

356
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:19,213
A friend, a friend.

357
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,115
- How do I know
you're my friend?

358
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:25,052
- I'm
only trying to help.

359
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:33,327
Peek underneath. You'll
laugh when you see.

360
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:36,163
- When I see what?

361
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:40,367
- What
you've been looking for.

362
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,053
Go on, pull!

363
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,964
Harder!

364
00:32:41,663 --> 00:32:42,496
- Whoa.

365
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:02,517
- Hello.

366
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:09,022
- Who are you?

367
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:11,626
- I'm not you, I'm me.

368
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:16,029
- If you're not me,
then who are you?

369
00:33:17,197 --> 00:33:18,833
- If I asked you
the same question,

370
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,300
I'd get the same answer too.

371
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:22,302
- So where are you?

372
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,639
- Here, you're looking
right up at me.

373
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:25,840
- But I'm looking down.

374
00:33:25,907 --> 00:33:27,542
- No, I'm looking down.

375
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,043
Can you find a rock?

376
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,378
- What for?

377
00:33:31,445 --> 00:33:32,479
- Can you?

378
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:39,721
- Like this?

379
00:33:39,787 --> 00:33:41,756
- Yeah, perfect. Now
throw it up to me.

380
00:33:41,823 --> 00:33:43,156
- But you're down.

381
00:33:43,223 --> 00:33:46,360
- I told you, I'm
up, you're down.

382
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:48,095
Now, come on, there's
not much time.

383
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:49,429
- Time for what?

384
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,365
Do you wanna find out

385
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:52,466
what it's like or not?

386
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:53,935
- Find out what what's like?

387
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:56,136
- Just throw the stupid rock.

388
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,175
Awesome.

389
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:04,579
- I don't feel any different.

390
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:06,681
- You will, here, catch.

391
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:39,246
Better now?

392
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,114
- What happened?

393
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:42,617
- We switched.

394
00:34:42,684 --> 00:34:43,818
- What? Okay.

395
00:34:46,854 --> 00:34:48,056
That was pretty cool,

396
00:34:48,155 --> 00:34:51,358
but let's switch back, please.

397
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:54,494
- Not now, tomorrow
morning at sunrise.

398
00:34:54,562 --> 00:34:56,564
But if you're late,
you'll be stuck up there.

399
00:34:56,631 --> 00:34:58,933
And I'll be stuck
down here forever.

400
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,134
- What? Wait.

401
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:02,503
- Sunrise, promise?

402
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,072
- Okay, okay, fine, I promise.

403
00:35:04,137 --> 00:35:05,405
- Don't forget to
put the plug back

404
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:07,207
to make it all work, goodbye.

405
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:08,743
- Wait. No!

406
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,210
Stop! Please don't!

407
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:11,211
Stop! No!

408
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:13,146
No! I changed my mind!

409
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:21,656
- Welcome.

410
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:23,591
Welcome.

411
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:27,695
- Please don't eat me.

412
00:35:27,762 --> 00:35:32,667
- Eat you? You mean as
if you were a cookie?

413
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:34,602
- I'm not a cookie.

414
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:38,706
- You smell like one.

415
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:42,810
Shall I try just a little bite?

416
00:35:52,754 --> 00:35:54,589
Play time's over.

417
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:58,392
Quick, off you go
before I change my mind.

418
00:36:00,962 --> 00:36:03,865
Good luck.

419
00:36:17,545 --> 00:36:19,312
- Well, what took you so long?

420
00:36:21,516 --> 00:36:24,451
- There's a huge creature thing

421
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,353
who wants to, who
wants to eat me.

422
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,822
- No, no, no.

423
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:30,390
It just ate a bunch of
naughty boys last week.

424
00:36:30,457 --> 00:36:33,293
It can't possibly
have an appetite yet.

425
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,962
- You tricked me.

426
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:35,997
- Did I?

427
00:36:36,064 --> 00:36:37,065
- Where am I?

428
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:38,132
- On the other side.

429
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:41,669
- Of what? Looks the same.

430
00:36:43,303 --> 00:36:44,304
- Does it?

431
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:49,677
- No, yes.

432
00:36:50,745 --> 00:36:53,548
But.

433
00:36:55,315 --> 00:36:56,349
Oh my God.

434
00:36:57,585 --> 00:36:59,654
Do I still have
parents on this side?

435
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:05,425
- Of course, and a
sister, don't forget.

436
00:37:05,492 --> 00:37:07,695
And everyone else.

437
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:13,835
But you seem to have
lost your flower.

438
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:19,774
- Well, yeah, that
water's really cold.

439
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:23,010
- Well, let's find you
something warm to wear.

440
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:40,728
I thought you were gonna hurry.

441
00:37:41,662 --> 00:37:42,496
- I am.

442
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:04,752
- Oh, look at you.

443
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,522
You look gorgeous.

444
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:09,891
You are gonna make a
beautiful young woman.

445
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:11,759
Well, you already are.

446
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:16,063
Ooh, try one of these.

447
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,598
They are delicious.

448
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:26,140
- Mm, oh my God.

449
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:28,509
- Right, you know those people

450
00:38:28,576 --> 00:38:30,611
that you were so keen
to hang out with,

451
00:38:30,678 --> 00:38:33,581
they would never let
you near food like this.

452
00:38:33,648 --> 00:38:34,782
- That's messed up.

453
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:38,085
- You know what's
really messed up?

454
00:38:39,253 --> 00:38:41,989
You not knowing how
incredibly pretty you are.

455
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:45,993
So

456
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:55,435
I want you to try
some of this drink.

457
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,739
- No, thank you.

458
00:38:58,806 --> 00:39:00,842
- Come on, nothing
terrible's gonna happen.

459
00:39:00,908 --> 00:39:02,643
- I'm too young.

460
00:39:03,778 --> 00:39:05,345
- Not on this side, you're not.

461
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:08,115
On this side, you know better.

462
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,553
- So if I do something
on this side,

463
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,655
does that change things

464
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:16,023
on the other side too?

465
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:19,660
- No more than any
action you take today

466
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:23,631
could change the events
of yesterday.

467
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:29,637
Unless, you've got to
make it to the plug

468
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,939
before sunrise tomorrow morning

469
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:36,110
because if you don't, you're
gonna be stuck on this side

470
00:39:36,177 --> 00:39:40,147
with all the choices
you've made forever.

471
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:49,790
So, drink up.

472
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:53,561
- I wanna go back now.

473
00:39:53,628 --> 00:39:54,962
Not 'til tomorrow morning.

474
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:56,864
- I mean, to the town.

475
00:39:57,999 --> 00:39:58,866
- Oh.

476
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:04,404
Well, well, off you go then.

477
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:05,673
But you gotta be
careful, you know,

478
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,843
those woods are very dangerous.

479
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:11,178
You, you can always just

480
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:12,880
stay here with me, right?

481
00:40:15,816 --> 00:40:18,119
Look, if you don't
like the fizz,

482
00:40:19,754 --> 00:40:21,522
try some of this lemonade

483
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:23,557
my grandmother made.

484
00:40:23,624 --> 00:40:25,893
The secret is in the cinnamon...

485
00:40:31,866 --> 00:40:34,735
Oh, well, choose the right path.

486
00:41:06,968 --> 00:41:10,905
- Boo, you
still smell like a cookie,

487
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:13,941
and I'm feeling rather peckish.

488
00:41:59,954 --> 00:42:01,989
- Fancy meeting you here.

489
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:09,263
- We need to talk.

490
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:11,232
- Neutral ground?

491
00:42:28,082 --> 00:42:31,786
Go on, you'll be fine.

492
00:42:31,852 --> 00:42:34,021
Follow the red ribbon.

493
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,295
- You know the rules.

494
00:42:41,362 --> 00:42:45,266
- And you know how
I feel about rules.

495
00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:48,803
- Paradiso is yours,
Inferno is mine.

496
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:54,041
- Usually, but my girl
isn't usual, is she?

497
00:42:57,845 --> 00:43:00,147
- She's not yours.

498
00:43:00,214 --> 00:43:03,150
- Really? Are you sure?

499
00:43:04,718 --> 00:43:06,620
- Her sister's as good as mine.

500
00:43:06,687 --> 00:43:08,389
Her parents too.

501
00:43:08,456 --> 00:43:11,258
She can't hold out against
all of them, poor girl.

502
00:43:11,325 --> 00:43:13,060
It's only a matter of time.

503
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:16,897
- And this key.

504
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:19,266
- Yes, our mother's key.

505
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:23,003
It must now pass to me.

506
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,039
- It's not a trinket, Sister.

507
00:43:25,106 --> 00:43:28,476
It's what makes
the flowers bloom.

508
00:43:28,543 --> 00:43:29,910
You burned yours.

509
00:43:29,977 --> 00:43:32,847
There's nothing left
in you to bloom.

510
00:43:32,913 --> 00:43:35,950
And yes, the key must pass,

511
00:43:36,016 --> 00:43:38,786
but to a child of flowers,

512
00:43:38,853 --> 00:43:42,089
whom you've brought
to me.

513
00:43:42,156 --> 00:43:46,694
Would you even recognize
our mother if you saw her?

514
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,095
I wonder.

515
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:55,936
- You, you, you would never

516
00:43:56,003 --> 00:43:58,038
pass it on to that little brat.

517
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:01,375
- I'd sooner give it to her

518
00:44:01,442 --> 00:44:03,010
than let you get your grubby

519
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:04,912
little mitts all over it.

520
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:07,114
- She wouldn't know
what to do with it.

521
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:10,751
- And you would?

522
00:44:29,737 --> 00:44:33,374
- Oh, name your price.

523
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:38,979
- You could never pay it.

524
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,450
It has to be given
freely, remember?

525
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:51,158
- Fine, give it to her.

526
00:44:52,026 --> 00:44:54,461
Go ahead, see what happens.

527
00:46:48,175 --> 00:46:51,412
- It will
be fun.

528
00:46:58,919 --> 00:46:59,953
- Pardon.

529
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:05,426
Hey.

530
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:06,561
- Ciao, bella.

531
00:47:07,696 --> 00:47:10,598
- Huh.

532
00:48:57,971 --> 00:49:01,475
- Savannah! Is it you?

533
00:49:01,543 --> 00:49:02,644
- Of course it's me.

534
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,780
- Ah, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

535
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:07,981
- Wherever I go, whatever I do,

536
00:49:08,048 --> 00:49:10,150
you just have to tag along.

537
00:49:11,418 --> 00:49:12,286
- Do not!

538
00:49:13,688 --> 00:49:15,590
Do you have any
idea where we are?

539
00:49:15,657 --> 00:49:18,325
- Ahh, duh, the hotel's
just around the corner.

540
00:49:18,392 --> 00:49:20,093
Oh, and Mom's worried about you.

541
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,630
- No. No, I mean, this place.

542
00:49:22,697 --> 00:49:24,866
This other side, this!

543
00:49:24,933 --> 00:49:26,768
- What are you talking about?

544
00:49:26,835 --> 00:49:28,335
And where'd you get that dress?

545
00:49:28,402 --> 00:49:29,938
- An old lady gave it to me.

546
00:49:30,003 --> 00:49:31,305
- Yeah, right.

547
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:32,473
Did she give you
that padded bra too?

548
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,441
- Ah, I just saw
something awful!

549
00:49:34,509 --> 00:49:37,110
- So awful it made
you grow boobs?

550
00:49:43,952 --> 00:49:45,152
Hey, what'd you see?

551
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:54,228
- Dad, with his arm around Yana.

552
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:55,797
- That's all?

553
00:49:55,864 --> 00:49:56,664
- That's all?

554
00:49:57,364 --> 00:49:59,233
What if he's in love with her?

555
00:49:59,934 --> 00:50:00,902
- Don't be stupid, Violet.

556
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:02,135
- I'm not stupid.

557
00:50:02,202 --> 00:50:04,371
It's just

558
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:07,374
everything in this
world is so wrong.

559
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:09,276
This isn't our real life.

560
00:50:09,343 --> 00:50:11,111
- Did that old
lady get you drunk?

561
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:13,815
- No! But there's a way back.

562
00:50:13,882 --> 00:50:15,349
I jumped through it.

563
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:17,317
- That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

564
00:50:17,384 --> 00:50:18,753
- Just listen to me.

565
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,054
We can go back. The
both of us together.

566
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:24,358
- Why? I'm having fun here.

567
00:50:24,424 --> 00:50:25,760
- You don't understand anything.

568
00:50:25,827 --> 00:50:28,095
- But can you just
quit being so crazy?

569
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:29,831
And don't you dare tell Mom.

570
00:50:29,898 --> 00:50:30,765
- Girls.

571
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:33,166
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Mom.

572
00:50:34,702 --> 00:50:36,336
- You rode away in the
middle of your job,

573
00:50:36,403 --> 00:50:38,706
without permission,
on a motorcycle.

574
00:50:38,773 --> 00:50:40,407
- It was a scooter.

575
00:50:40,474 --> 00:50:42,010
- And you! I almost had the
police out looking for you.

576
00:50:42,075 --> 00:50:43,410
I should just ground
you both for life.

577
00:50:43,477 --> 00:50:44,746
- Mom, nothing even happened.

578
00:50:44,812 --> 00:50:47,114
- That is not the point!

579
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,282
Where'd you get that outfit?

580
00:50:48,348 --> 00:50:49,617
- Some old lady gave it to her.

581
00:50:49,684 --> 00:50:50,518
- What?

582
00:50:52,687 --> 00:50:55,155
Are you wearing a-
- Leave me alone.

583
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:56,490
- Oh, forget it.

584
00:50:56,558 --> 00:50:57,692
Let's just start getting
ready for dinner.

585
00:50:57,759 --> 00:50:58,993
We shouldn't be late.

586
00:51:14,141 --> 00:51:17,477
- Wow. My girls look
beautiful tonight.

587
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:22,650
Violet, that is a great dress.

588
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:27,555
What happened? You,
you look kinda, oh.

589
00:51:30,725 --> 00:51:33,661
- Violet, sweetie,
where's your flower?

590
00:51:37,532 --> 00:51:38,365
- Uh.

591
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:42,971
- You know, we got
some great stuff today.

592
00:51:43,037 --> 00:51:44,572
You both should take a look.

593
00:51:48,509 --> 00:51:49,644
- Oh, these are beautiful.

594
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:51,144
- Wow. Thank you.

595
00:51:58,485 --> 00:51:59,286
- Whoa.

596
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:02,624
What?

597
00:52:06,094 --> 00:52:07,729
When were these taken?

598
00:52:09,564 --> 00:52:10,665
- These were awful.

599
00:52:10,732 --> 00:52:11,899
- Dad.

600
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:13,935
- Those were taken
today, you were there.

601
00:52:14,002 --> 00:52:15,570
- I, I certainly wasn't.

602
00:52:15,637 --> 00:52:16,871
- Yeah, you were,
I could see you.

603
00:52:16,938 --> 00:52:18,372
You were reading your book.

604
00:52:18,438 --> 00:52:20,074
- I must've
been on the phone.

605
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,475
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

606
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:22,977
You were telling me
a riveting story,

607
00:52:23,044 --> 00:52:24,812
something about, uh, your job.

608
00:52:27,548 --> 00:52:32,754
- Hmm, but Savannah
is beautiful. Yes?

609
00:52:36,624 --> 00:52:39,794
- Hello? The correct
answer is yes.

610
00:52:41,495 --> 00:52:43,263
- Where's Daniele?

611
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:45,165
- Ugh, probably hiding from us.

612
00:52:45,232 --> 00:52:46,934
Knowing that boy.

613
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:48,402
- He hates working for you.

614
00:52:48,468 --> 00:52:50,705
- Violet, mind
your own business.

615
00:52:57,045 --> 00:52:58,646
Why would anyone hide from you?

616
00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:04,852
- This one, Violeta.

617
00:53:06,988 --> 00:53:09,857
She has something so rare.

618
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:13,661
So unique.

619
00:53:16,263 --> 00:53:18,933
Of course, it all
comes from you.

620
00:53:25,338 --> 00:53:27,809
- Mom, I don't feel very well,

621
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:29,309
can I go back?

622
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:32,780
- Great idea, get some
rest for the party.

623
00:53:32,847 --> 00:53:34,782
- I don't wanna
come to your party.

624
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,318
- But I can still go, right?

625
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,457
- These, uh, these girls
broke a lot of rules today.

626
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:45,392
So they need to go to bed

627
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:47,327
and think about that, hmm.

628
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:50,998
Alright, go ahead, honey.

629
00:53:54,001 --> 00:53:55,435
- Mom.

630
00:53:55,502 --> 00:53:56,604
- Well, I mean,
everybody's gonna be there.

631
00:53:56,671 --> 00:53:59,473
Magazine editors, model scouts,

632
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,577
designers from London,
Paris, Milan, New York.

633
00:54:02,643 --> 00:54:06,246
Of course, Savannah
will be guest of honor.

634
00:54:06,313 --> 00:54:09,517
- That's, that's
very kind, but umm...

635
00:54:09,584 --> 00:54:10,618
Well, we've decided that-

636
00:54:10,685 --> 00:54:12,019
- Oh, come on, Dad, please!

637
00:54:12,086 --> 00:54:14,889
- No. No, it's too much.

638
00:54:16,289 --> 00:54:17,625
- This is so unfair.

639
00:54:17,692 --> 00:54:19,727
- Savannah, end of discussion.

640
00:55:01,936 --> 00:55:03,303
- What are you doing?

641
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,573
You can't go to the
party, Dad said so.

642
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,974
- Shut up.

643
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:09,210
Dad is not gonna
know unless you tell.

644
00:55:09,277 --> 00:55:10,845
- Why do you even wanna go?

645
00:55:10,912 --> 00:55:13,413
- Because I'm
the guest of honor, Violet.

646
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,615
- They're just saying that.

647
00:55:14,682 --> 00:55:15,983
- Next time you see me,

648
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:18,119
I'm gonna be on
the cover of Vogue.

649
00:55:18,186 --> 00:55:21,522
- Who cares? Everybody
there will be horrible.

650
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:25,026
- Maybe you're right.

651
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,595
Franco's kind of a creep.

652
00:55:27,662 --> 00:55:29,797
He looks at me like ugh.

653
00:55:29,864 --> 00:55:32,633
I mean while Dad is
drooling all over Yana,

654
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,702
and he can't see she's
just playing him.

655
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:37,104
- Says the girl that's
being played by Yana.

656
00:55:38,573 --> 00:55:40,440
- The only nice one's Daniele.

657
00:55:41,642 --> 00:55:43,878
- He's too young for you.

658
00:55:43,945 --> 00:55:46,113
- It was so cool,
holding him tight

659
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,615
on the back of his bike.

660
00:55:47,682 --> 00:55:48,816
I could smell him.

661
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:51,451
- Eww.

662
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:53,453
- Yeah, it wasn't exactly
like a nice smell,

663
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:55,823
but it was good.

664
00:56:34,729 --> 00:56:36,931
- Did you guys kiss?

665
00:56:36,998 --> 00:56:38,666
- What? We were
in the middle of town.

666
00:56:38,733 --> 00:56:40,868
There are people,
like, everywhere.

667
00:56:42,536 --> 00:56:43,871
- So you didn't kiss?

668
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:48,408
- Not yet.

669
00:57:09,664 --> 00:57:10,698
- Savannah.

670
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:13,935
- Ciao.

671
00:57:14,001 --> 00:57:14,835
- Ciao.

672
00:57:14,902 --> 00:57:16,170
- I can't believe this.

673
00:57:16,237 --> 00:57:18,172
How could you let this happen?

674
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:19,774
Those pictures of Savannah.

675
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,309
You basically signed
your own daughter

676
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:22,877
up to make pornography.

677
00:57:22,944 --> 00:57:25,313
- No, no, I signed my
daughter up to be a model.

678
00:57:25,379 --> 00:57:26,213
Where were you?

679
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:28,683
You were supposed to keep
an eye on that creep Franco,

680
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:29,717
but somehow that never happened.

681
00:57:29,784 --> 00:57:31,052
- What does that mean?

682
00:57:31,118 --> 00:57:33,120
- You know exactly
what that means.

683
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:35,423
- Is your sister with you?

684
00:57:35,488 --> 00:57:37,191
- No.

685
00:57:37,258 --> 00:57:38,626
- Oh.

686
00:57:38,693 --> 00:57:39,961
- Are you here to
take me to the party?

687
00:57:42,229 --> 00:57:45,166
- Don't go. They're bad people.

688
00:57:45,232 --> 00:57:47,735
- It's fine, I'll
find it on my own.

689
00:57:47,802 --> 00:57:49,303
Oh, and don't bother
waiting for Violet.

690
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:51,038
She's already asleep.

691
00:57:52,206 --> 00:57:54,275
- Oh. Oh, so it's my fault.

692
00:57:54,342 --> 00:57:55,843
I guess Yana's my fault too.

693
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:57,111
- All right, can we please

694
00:57:57,178 --> 00:57:58,546
just go back to our room?

695
00:57:58,612 --> 00:57:59,714
- Why would I wanna
go back to the room?

696
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,748
You don't wanna be with me!

697
00:58:00,815 --> 00:58:02,149
You wanna be with Yana!

698
00:58:02,216 --> 00:58:03,084
- Alright, listen to me.

699
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,484
- Don't touch me!

700
00:58:04,552 --> 00:58:05,553
- All right, you
need to sleep it off!

701
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:06,687
This conversation is over!

702
00:58:06,754 --> 00:58:08,022
- Yeah, this marriage is over!

703
00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:09,924
- Fine by me!

704
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,167
Violet.

705
00:58:20,234 --> 00:58:23,804
- Yana, Yana thinks that
she decides everything.

706
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:28,209
But ,
Franco has the eye.

707
00:58:28,275 --> 00:58:31,846
Franco chooses who Yana sees.

708
00:58:31,912 --> 00:58:35,516
And Franco chooses
how she sees her.

709
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:37,551
Okay, with...

710
00:58:40,554 --> 00:58:44,492
Without Franco,
Yana sees nothing.

711
00:58:49,897 --> 00:58:53,667
And don't forget,
be nice to Franco.

712
00:58:58,105 --> 00:58:58,939
- Savannah!

713
00:59:00,274 --> 00:59:01,475
- What are you doing here?

714
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:03,044
- Coming with you.

715
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,278
- No, you're not.

716
00:59:04,345 --> 00:59:05,613
- Please come back.

717
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:07,481
- Leave me alone.

718
00:59:07,548 --> 00:59:08,983
- Are you meeting Daniele?

719
00:59:10,017 --> 00:59:11,986
- That's all you really
care about, isn't it?

720
00:59:12,053 --> 00:59:12,920
- Are you?

721
00:59:12,987 --> 00:59:14,388
- God, just quit following me.

722
00:59:14,455 --> 00:59:16,057
- I'll follow if I want to.

723
00:59:17,058 --> 00:59:18,559
He thinks you're a stupid cow.

724
00:59:18,626 --> 00:59:20,127
- Who? Who thinks
I'm a stupid cow?

725
00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:21,328
- Daniele, he told me.
- Daniele never said that.

726
00:59:21,395 --> 00:59:22,296
- Did too, yesterday.

727
00:59:22,363 --> 00:59:23,697
- Did not! Did not!

728
00:59:23,764 --> 00:59:24,799
- First thing when he
saw you at the audition.

729
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:26,167
- You know, just because you

730
00:59:26,233 --> 00:59:27,902
suddenly grew a
pair of junior boobs

731
00:59:27,968 --> 00:59:30,004
does not mean you know anything.

732
00:59:30,071 --> 00:59:32,373
Daniele likes me,
and we're gonna kiss.

733
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,908
- Fine! Go ahead!

734
00:59:33,974 --> 00:59:35,843
He's a jerk who only
wants to make out with you

735
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,111
so he can brag about it!

736
00:59:37,178 --> 00:59:38,279
- Ugh!

737
01:00:05,139 --> 01:00:05,973
- Ciao.

738
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,675
- Ciao.

739
01:00:10,678 --> 01:00:11,712
- Are you okay?

740
01:00:13,647 --> 01:00:14,682
- I'm fine.

741
01:00:16,717 --> 01:00:18,886
- Did you go to the woods?

742
01:00:21,822 --> 01:00:23,324
- You were right
about the witch, hmm.

743
01:00:25,126 --> 01:00:26,360
- What happened?

744
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:27,261
- Nothing.

745
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:30,064
- Are you sure?

746
01:00:31,065 --> 01:00:33,634
- You're looking for her, right?

747
01:00:34,502 --> 01:00:38,038
- Who, Savannah? No.

748
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:41,775
- So, what are you doing here?

749
01:00:44,111 --> 01:00:47,114
- I'm waiting, and
I'll wait some more.

750
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:47,948
- What for?

751
01:00:48,983 --> 01:00:50,117
- To be grown up.

752
01:00:56,991 --> 01:00:58,627
What do you wait for?

753
01:00:58,692 --> 01:00:59,760
- Sunrise.

754
01:01:01,195 --> 01:01:04,798
- You're lucky,
tomorrow you go home.

755
01:01:05,733 --> 01:01:07,935
Never have to see
Franco or Yana again.

756
01:01:12,673 --> 01:01:16,611
- I'd like to see you again.

757
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:19,246
- I would like to see you too.

758
01:01:25,452 --> 01:01:28,155
For you. For when you go away.

759
01:01:52,146 --> 01:01:55,550
- Wow!

760
01:01:55,617 --> 01:01:57,985
She's a lying little hypocrite.

761
01:01:58,052 --> 01:01:59,053
But she was right about you.

762
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,154
- That's not what I meant.

763
01:02:00,221 --> 01:02:01,789
- Five minutes ago, she told me

764
01:02:01,855 --> 01:02:02,990
that you were nothing
but a little jerk

765
01:02:03,057 --> 01:02:04,091
trying to make out with girls

766
01:02:04,158 --> 01:02:05,392
so you could brag about it.

767
01:02:07,761 --> 01:02:09,830
Your exact words.

768
01:02:09,897 --> 01:02:10,831
- I hate you.

769
01:02:11,832 --> 01:02:12,701
- I hate you too.

770
01:02:21,175 --> 01:02:22,009
- Violet!

771
01:02:24,778 --> 01:02:25,813
Violet.

772
01:02:32,152 --> 01:02:36,423
- Chloe! Ah, I
thought it was you.

773
01:02:39,793 --> 01:02:41,061
It's nice to see you.

774
01:02:45,634 --> 01:02:46,467
What's wrong?

775
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:53,040
- Mom?

776
01:02:53,807 --> 01:02:56,410
- Oh, oh no, Violet! Wait!

777
01:02:57,378 --> 01:02:59,346
Wait, stop!

778
01:03:01,882 --> 01:03:02,916
Violet!

779
01:03:18,198 --> 01:03:20,501
- Don't mess with Franco!

780
01:03:24,038 --> 01:03:25,906
If you do it again,
I will kill you.

781
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,311
- No! Bastardo!

782
01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:53,735
- Jerry, ah.

783
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:08,449
- Ciao.

784
01:04:08,516 --> 01:04:10,785
Franco knew you would
never stay away.

785
01:04:12,486 --> 01:04:13,420
And we're gonna find you
something fantastic to wear.

786
01:04:13,487 --> 01:04:14,455
- Oh, but-

787
01:04:14,522 --> 01:04:16,090
- You'll love it.

788
01:04:22,697 --> 01:04:23,497
- Uh.

789
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,569
- You're early.

790
01:04:32,406 --> 01:04:34,908
- Go on! Do it!

791
01:04:34,975 --> 01:04:36,210
- Do what?

792
01:04:36,276 --> 01:04:37,945
- Bite my head
off, I don't care.

793
01:04:38,011 --> 01:04:39,581
- Why?

794
01:04:39,647 --> 01:04:43,183
Because your parents turned
out to be merely human?

795
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:46,788
- They could be humans
without being so selfish.

796
01:04:48,188 --> 01:04:50,157
- Oh, so you're giving up?

797
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:51,526
- No, I'm going back,

798
01:04:51,593 --> 01:04:53,595
where everything
else isn't so crap.

799
01:04:54,562 --> 01:04:58,132
- Huh? I thought you
were braver than that.

800
01:04:58,198 --> 01:05:01,502
- Brave? Nobody on
this side is brave.

801
01:05:01,569 --> 01:05:03,505
Everybody here is weak,

802
01:05:03,571 --> 01:05:06,206
and mean, and selfish.

803
01:05:06,273 --> 01:05:08,075
And I don't wanna
see them anymore,

804
01:05:08,142 --> 01:05:09,511
any of them.

805
01:05:09,577 --> 01:05:13,447
- What if they were all
the same on both sides?

806
01:05:13,515 --> 01:05:14,381
What if it was you

807
01:05:14,448 --> 01:05:16,851
who wasn't seeing them before?

808
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:19,219
- No, that's not how it is.

809
01:05:19,286 --> 01:05:21,856
I'm going back,
and I'm going now.

810
01:05:21,922 --> 01:05:23,357
- It's too soon.

811
01:05:42,342 --> 01:05:46,146
- Hey, where's my bike, huh?

812
01:05:46,213 --> 01:05:48,015
- I washed it in the river.

813
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,451
- No. No!

814
01:05:50,518 --> 01:05:51,519
- Yes, sucker.

815
01:05:51,586 --> 01:05:54,421
- Now, now, boys.
Let's play nice.

816
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:57,458
Guest of honor's here.

817
01:05:57,525 --> 01:06:00,595
- Savannah, what have
they done to you?

818
01:06:00,662 --> 01:06:03,163
- Look how beautiful
we made you.

819
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:06,233
- No, she was beautiful before.

820
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,435
Now, she's just
like all the others.

821
01:06:23,383 --> 01:06:25,653
- Violet! Violet, please.

822
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:29,156
Where are you?

823
01:07:00,454 --> 01:07:01,154
- Uh.

824
01:07:40,728 --> 01:07:43,531
- Savannah, we want
you to join us.

825
01:07:44,431 --> 01:07:46,500
Become a member of our family.

826
01:07:48,736 --> 01:07:50,470
Do you accept?

827
01:07:54,709 --> 01:07:55,877
- Yes.

828
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:32,580
- You know what to do.

829
01:09:55,163 --> 01:10:00,367
Now let's show
ourselves to the world.

830
01:10:25,993 --> 01:10:28,996
- Go on.

831
01:12:04,592 --> 01:12:05,793
- Ladies and gentlemen,

832
01:12:07,028 --> 01:12:10,898
I want to welcome all of
you extraordinary people.

833
01:12:10,965 --> 01:12:16,170
You are the first to experience
the Paradiso collection.

834
01:12:17,138 --> 01:12:21,809
And now, I give you
the incomparable Yana.

835
01:12:38,926 --> 01:12:40,795
- I love beauty.

836
01:12:40,862 --> 01:12:44,999
Beautiful bodies,
beautiful clothes,

837
01:12:45,066 --> 01:12:46,968
and beautiful lives.

838
01:12:47,034 --> 01:12:49,704
So may I present to you

839
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:52,607
my beautiful birds of paradise

840
01:12:53,841 --> 01:12:56,644
and my new
collection?

841
01:14:16,657 --> 01:14:17,525
- Violeta.

842
01:14:23,397 --> 01:14:28,602
Violeta! Violeta!

843
01:14:31,939 --> 01:14:32,773
Violeta.

844
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:36,944
- Daniele, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

845
01:14:40,081 --> 01:14:41,749
- It doesn't matter.

846
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:45,920
Are you okay? What happened?

847
01:14:45,987 --> 01:14:46,887
- I'm fine.

848
01:14:47,888 --> 01:14:49,924
- Come on, I take
you to the hotel.

849
01:14:49,991 --> 01:14:54,695
- No, wait, there's
this door in the forest.

850
01:14:54,762 --> 01:14:56,964
I gotta get to it
before sun comes up.

851
01:14:59,133 --> 01:15:00,434
- Maybe you hit
your head on a rock.

852
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,902
- No, I didn't.

853
01:15:03,537 --> 01:15:04,905
Just trust me.

854
01:15:05,973 --> 01:15:08,709
Just, please. Just trust me.

855
01:15:10,578 --> 01:15:11,946
Just trust me.

856
01:15:14,548 --> 01:15:17,284
- Okay.

857
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:19,153
- Wait, wait, what happened?

858
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,521
Have you seen Savannah?

859
01:15:20,588 --> 01:15:23,124
- Yes, I did. She's
one of them now.

860
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:24,191
- No, mm, she isn't.

861
01:15:25,159 --> 01:15:26,761
We have to save her.

862
01:15:27,928 --> 01:15:30,564
- Don't you worry. We're family.

863
01:15:36,137 --> 01:15:36,971
- Yeah.

864
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:24,819
- Where is Savannah?

865
01:16:27,154 --> 01:16:28,656
Where is Savannah?

866
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:31,592
- They took her to a room.

867
01:16:31,659 --> 01:16:32,693
- Where?

868
01:16:44,672 --> 01:16:47,875
- Time to
decide, Savannah.

869
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:50,778
Are you ready?

870
01:16:50,845 --> 01:16:53,147
Ready to take your
career to the next level?

871
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:58,219
- She's ready. I can tell.

872
01:17:01,822 --> 01:17:03,057
- Savannah? Savannah?

873
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:05,960
- Violeta.

874
01:17:06,026 --> 01:17:07,495
- What are you
doing with my sister?

875
01:17:07,562 --> 01:17:09,730
- Waiting for you, darling.

876
01:17:09,797 --> 01:17:11,132
You took your time,

877
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:13,300
but I'm happy that
you're finally here.

878
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:15,202
- Yes, but this, this dress,

879
01:17:15,269 --> 01:17:16,637
I mean, Mamma mia.

880
01:17:16,704 --> 01:17:18,005
We'll get her something
much better, I promise.

881
01:17:18,072 --> 01:17:20,341
Not you.

882
01:17:20,407 --> 01:17:21,876
- Savannah? Are you okay?

883
01:17:21,942 --> 01:17:24,345
- What are you
doing? It's too late.

884
01:17:24,411 --> 01:17:26,180
She's one of us.

885
01:17:26,247 --> 01:17:28,649
- Come on, we're gonna have
so much fun, I promise.

886
01:17:28,716 --> 01:17:30,151
What do you say, Violeta?

887
01:17:30,217 --> 01:17:34,188
- But hey, you're
always welcome to join.

888
01:17:35,422 --> 01:17:36,558
- Savannah, I'm
taking you home now.

889
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:37,992
It's okay. It's okay.

890
01:17:38,058 --> 01:17:38,926
- They're
both coming with me.

891
01:17:38,993 --> 01:17:40,327
- No, they're not.

892
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:44,698
Now clear out!

893
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:47,168
- I love you.

894
01:17:48,235 --> 01:17:50,337
- Oh God.

895
01:17:50,404 --> 01:17:51,438
- Love you.

896
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:05,419
- Okay, let's get out of here.

897
01:18:05,486 --> 01:18:06,854
- What? Savannah?

898
01:18:06,921 --> 01:18:08,289
- What are you? What?

899
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:09,658
What the hell

900
01:18:09,723 --> 01:18:10,758
did you do?
- I'm clear.

901
01:18:10,824 --> 01:18:12,026
- Franco, forget the camera.

902
01:18:12,092 --> 01:18:13,294
- I'll kill you!
Look what he did!

903
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,196
- Stop!

904
01:18:16,297 --> 01:18:17,364
- Now you're dead!

905
01:18:20,034 --> 01:18:23,304
- Franco!

906
01:18:24,972 --> 01:18:27,576
Oh God.

907
01:18:27,642 --> 01:18:30,277
Come on.

908
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:42,751
- Savannah!

909
01:19:42,816 --> 01:19:44,251
- Hey!

910
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:46,387
- Savannah.

911
01:19:46,453 --> 01:19:47,288
- Daniele!

912
01:19:50,124 --> 01:19:52,059
Daniele, Daniele.

913
01:19:52,126 --> 01:19:54,596
- Violet, where are you guys?

914
01:20:04,371 --> 01:20:05,039
- Daniele.

915
01:20:22,189 --> 01:20:24,892
- Please, this is crazy.

916
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:26,493
Why is she so special?

917
01:20:27,729 --> 01:20:28,697
- She has my key.

918
01:20:28,763 --> 01:20:29,830
- Your what?

919
01:20:29,897 --> 01:20:31,432
- Let's go, move!

920
01:20:40,074 --> 01:20:42,076
- Whoa! What is that?

921
01:20:42,142 --> 01:20:43,444
- Don't just stand there!

922
01:20:43,511 --> 01:20:44,411
Stab it! Kill it!

923
01:20:44,478 --> 01:20:45,412
- Are, are you kidding?

924
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:47,615
- No, do it. Now.

925
01:20:49,517 --> 01:20:51,151
- Shoo! Go away!

926
01:20:51,218 --> 01:20:56,323
- Ooh, I'm so
scared. I'm shaking.

927
01:20:56,957 --> 01:20:58,292
- Look, final warning.

928
01:20:58,359 --> 01:21:01,596
- Careful, I'll kill
you with my eyes.

929
01:21:03,765 --> 01:21:05,899
- You know what? I'm done.

930
01:21:06,835 --> 01:21:08,135
This is your problem.

931
01:21:08,202 --> 01:21:09,203
Not mine!
- Franco.

932
01:21:09,269 --> 01:21:10,337
Franco, get back here now!

933
01:21:14,975 --> 01:21:16,310
I hate you.

934
01:21:16,377 --> 01:21:19,313
- I know. You fear
the me in you.

935
01:21:20,314 --> 01:21:24,151
Which is why you can
never have the key.

936
01:21:24,218 --> 01:21:28,122
Paradiso is mine
to give, remember?

937
01:21:28,188 --> 01:21:30,457
- To that little brat?

938
01:21:30,525 --> 01:21:32,192
I'll just destroy her.

939
01:21:32,259 --> 01:21:34,294
And then you'll fade to dust.

940
01:21:34,361 --> 01:21:36,831
And my Inferno
will live forever.

941
01:21:38,566 --> 01:21:41,969
- Live forever?
You're already dead.

942
01:21:42,771 --> 01:21:45,339
And you just can't see it!

943
01:21:45,406 --> 01:21:46,674
- No!

944
01:21:46,741 --> 01:21:47,809
You're the one that's dead!

945
01:22:15,469 --> 01:22:18,205
- Would
you even recognize me?

946
01:22:18,272 --> 01:22:23,410
I wonder.

947
01:22:35,824 --> 01:22:38,693
- No, no.

948
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:38,118
- You've got
to make it to the plug

949
01:23:38,185 --> 01:23:40,989
before sunrise tomorrow morning.

950
01:23:41,054 --> 01:23:42,489
- No, no, no, no.

951
01:24:11,019 --> 01:24:12,052
Oh, great.

952
01:24:17,659 --> 01:24:19,426
- I've got you now.

953
01:24:20,427 --> 01:24:22,697
- What do you want?

954
01:24:22,764 --> 01:24:26,668
- You, darling. It's
always been you.

955
01:24:26,734 --> 01:24:27,569
- Never.

956
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,630
- Fine. New offer.

957
01:24:57,130 --> 01:25:01,268
I let you go if
you give me that.

958
01:25:01,335 --> 01:25:03,203
- What? This?

959
01:25:07,742 --> 01:25:10,243
Fine, take it

960
01:25:11,311 --> 01:25:13,447
if you leave me, Savannah,

961
01:25:13,514 --> 01:25:15,583
and Daniele alone forever.

962
01:25:16,985 --> 01:25:17,819
- Deal.

963
01:25:20,187 --> 01:25:21,355
I promise.

964
01:25:27,929 --> 01:25:30,565
You silly, silly little girl.

965
01:25:30,632 --> 01:25:33,200
You've just given me
the key, which means...

966
01:25:39,574 --> 01:25:40,808
Why?

967
01:25:44,045 --> 01:25:47,915
You.

968
01:25:54,522 --> 01:25:55,389
- Want to try again?

969
01:25:55,455 --> 01:25:56,490
- It's not a toy,

970
01:25:56,557 --> 01:25:57,925
you stupid, stupid little girl.

971
01:25:57,992 --> 01:25:59,459
No, it's mine!

972
01:26:02,429 --> 01:26:04,098
What? What are you...

973
01:26:04,164 --> 01:26:06,668
Mother! You're
supposed to, stop!

974
01:26:07,869 --> 01:26:09,269
Ah, no!

975
01:27:26,214 --> 01:27:29,684
- Hazel!

976
01:27:29,751 --> 01:27:30,785
Hello?

977
01:27:38,425 --> 01:27:43,631
Hazel! Hazel.

978
01:28:26,107 --> 01:28:28,676
- I knew you'd do well.

979
01:28:28,743 --> 01:28:29,577
- Hazel.

980
01:28:33,781 --> 01:28:36,383
Thank you. I didn't make it.

981
01:28:36,449 --> 01:28:38,719
I'm stuck on the side forever.

982
01:28:38,786 --> 01:28:40,788
- Well, that's one
way of looking at it.

983
01:28:43,658 --> 01:28:45,927
You reached it after all.

984
01:28:48,696 --> 01:28:52,633
Life can be just as
magical with this garden.

985
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,802
Only it's a lot more fun.

986
01:29:02,577 --> 01:29:04,344
- Violeta!

987
01:29:08,049 --> 01:29:08,816
Violeta!

988
01:29:08,883 --> 01:29:09,817
- Daniele!

989
01:29:12,119 --> 01:29:12,954
Ciao.

990
01:29:13,855 --> 01:29:15,256
- Ciao.

991
01:29:19,627 --> 01:29:22,096
So you decide to stay?

992
01:29:22,163 --> 01:29:22,997
- Mm-hmm.

993
01:29:27,467 --> 01:29:29,103
Where's Savannah?

994
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:30,338
- Let's go.

995
01:29:38,012 --> 01:29:39,814
- Savannah? Savannah!

996
01:29:39,881 --> 01:29:41,349
- Violet!
