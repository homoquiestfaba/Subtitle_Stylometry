1
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:20,851
<i>In the beginning.</i>
<i>the Knox river in Maine belonged to God,</i>

2
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:25,131
<i>who leased it cheap to the Algonquians,</i>

3
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:32,132
<i>who took their stewardship of the land</i>
<i>seriously until they were wiped out</i>

4
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:34,368
<i>by rum...</i>

5
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:35,846
<i>and war...</i>

6
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:37,121
<i>and the clap</i>

7
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:41,451
<i>and Christianity</i>
<i>and other European diseases.</i>

8
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:44,291
<i>The new proprietors were white men</i>

9
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:47,444
<i>who first used the river for logging.</i>

10
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:49,211
<i>Timber!</i>

11
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:54,883
<i>Then for power. to manufacture textiles.</i>

12
00:02:56,573 --> 00:03:02,330
<i>And, finally, as a toilet to flush their dyes</i>
<i>and chemical wastes into the Atlantic.</i>

13
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:06,330
<i>The story was much the same</i>
<i>on every river in New England</i>

14
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:12,562
<i>where tanneries and textile mills sprang from</i>
<i>the unoffending soil like noxious weeds.</i>

15
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:17,365
<i>The town that shot up</i>
<i>along the banks of the Knox.</i>

16
00:03:18,773 --> 00:03:21,765
<i>midway between Canada</i>
<i>and the Atlantic Ocean,</i>

17
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,052
<i>was no better and no worse than the rest.</i>

18
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,408
<i>Like the other mill towns along the Knox.</i>

19
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:36,241
<i>Empire Falls was built and populated</i>
<i>by European immigrants</i>

20
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:43,209
<i>with names like Robideaux</i>
<i>and Minty and Daws</i>

21
00:03:43,253 --> 00:03:46,211
<i>and Comeau and Callahan</i>

22
00:03:46,253 --> 00:03:48,050
<i>and Roby.</i>

23
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,252
Insomniacs of the world unite.

24
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:00,002
- Morning, Horace.
- Morning.

25
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:21,121
Guess I'm gonna have to start
locking my car, aren't I?

26
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,771
Hiya!

27
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:27,852
- How come you're hot-wiring my car, old man?
- Fella down in the Keys taught me.

28
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,487
I didn't ask how, Dad, I asked why.

29
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:34,412
I thought you was on vacation.
If I'd known you was back, I would have asked.

30
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:36,364
Where's your car?

31
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:41,123
Went down to Callahans
one night last week.

32
00:04:41,173 --> 00:04:43,164
When I come out, it was gone.

33
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:46,523
- Somebody stole that old beater?
- Not exactly.

34
00:04:46,573 --> 00:04:48,962
I must've forgot to set the emergency brake.

35
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:52,923
Made it all the way to the river.

36
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:57,928
Get out of there. Come on.

37
00:05:03,213 --> 00:05:06,444
How am I supposed to get around
with no wheels?

38
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:10,091
Here, take the bus.

39
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,210
Dick.

40
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:20,893
<i>Maybe the Robys and the Mintys and the</i>
<i>Daws and the Rodrigues built Empire Falls,</i>

41
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:24,608
<i>but they didn't own it.</i>

42
00:05:24,653 --> 00:05:26,291
<i>No.</i>

43
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:30,326
<i>The family that had ruled the town</i>
<i>for more than a century</i>

44
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:33,092
<i>was named Whiting.</i>

45
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:39,566
<i>The Whitings didn't own the whole town,</i>

46
00:05:40,613 --> 00:05:42,808
<i>just the parts worth owning.</i>

47
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:47,881
<i>The textile mill. the shirt factory</i>
<i>and the paper mill upstream.</i>

48
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:50,128
<i>When these enterprises</i>
<i>ceased to be profitable,</i>

49
00:05:50,173 --> 00:05:55,770
<i>they were sold to greedy multinational</i>
<i>corporations that looted their machinery,</i>

50
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:59,522
<i>converted their remaining assets to cash.</i>

51
00:05:59,573 --> 00:06:03,043
<i>leaving behind</i>
<i>nothing but decaying, hollow shells</i>

52
00:06:03,093 --> 00:06:05,084
<i>inhabited by ghosts.</i>

53
00:06:09,413 --> 00:06:12,086
- Bill! Hi.
- Miles Roby.

54
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:15,682
Did you hear?
CB's folly struck again while you were gone.

55
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:20,568
- Everybody by the river's got a full basement.
- And this isn't even flood season.

56
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:25,812
Some spring after a bad winter,
this whole town is gonna be swept away.

57
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:30,051
- It'd be a mercy, if you think about it.
- I don't know about that.

58
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:32,049
<i>CB's folly.</i>

59
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:37,042
<i>That'd be Charles Beaumont Whiting, who</i>
<i>took it personally that. every time it rained,</i>

60
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:39,288
<i>the Knox River deposited garbage,</i>

61
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:43,292
<i>great mountains of it.</i>
<i>right on CB's doorstep.</i>

62
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,801
<i>Was God laughing at him?</i>

63
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:49,448
<i>If so, the Knox.</i>
<i>and maybe God for that matter,</i>

64
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,688
<i>needed a good straightening out.</i>

65
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,612
<i>More about that later.</i>

66
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:58,362
- Miles, how was your vacation?
- Over too soon.

67
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:02,087
Did you hear
someone might be buying the mill?

68
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:06,285
My restaurant's where
all those rumours start, Lesley.

69
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,722
- That'll be $63, please.
- All right.

70
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:11,571
Miles, you've been summoned.

71
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:13,604
I was afraid of that.

72
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:18,162
- Hello, Susan.
- Hello. She'll be with you in a minute.

73
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:20,932
Why are we having this conversation,
Mr Sampson?

74
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:26,764
We both know this proposal is a non-starter.
How about this? You...

75
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:30,283
<i>Ah, the storied Whiting males.</i>

76
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,483
<i>Tragic figures. some would say.</i>

77
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:37,448
<i>Though shrewd in business, every last</i>
<i>one of them possessed an unerring knack</i>

78
00:07:37,493 --> 00:07:42,692
<i>for marrying the one woman in the world who</i>
<i>would regard making them utterly miserable</i>

79
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:45,725
<i>as her life's noble endeavour.</i>

80
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:49,129
<i>Charles Beaumont,</i>
<i>the last of the Whiting males.</i>

81
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:53,166
<i>imagined he could cheat destiny</i>
<i>by avoiding the altar.</i>

82
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:57,569
<i>To this end, he decided</i>
<i>to build himself a grand new house</i>

83
00:07:57,613 --> 00:08:00,207
<i>and live in it as a bachelor.</i>

84
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:03,404
<i>The perfect spot</i>
<i>was called Robideaux's Neck</i>

85
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:08,607
<i>which was owned, not coincidently.</i>
<i>by some people named Robideaux</i>

86
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:12,441
<i>who regarded it as worthless,</i>
<i>unless you collected river trash.</i>

87
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:17,412
<i>Stunned to learn that CB Whiting</i>
<i>wanted to purchase Robideaux's Neck,</i>

88
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:22,447
<i>they quickly sold it to him at a fraction</i>
<i>of the price he'd been prepared to offer.</i>

89
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:28,288
<i>At the closing, CB couldn't help noticing</i>
<i>young Francine Robideaux,</i>

90
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,528
<i>who, unlike the rest of her clan,</i>
<i>had been to college</i>

91
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:35,363
<i>where she'd learned, among other</i>
<i>useful things, the subtle art of flirtation.</i>

92
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:39,405
<i>Only after they were wed</i>
<i>did it occur to CB Whiting</i>

93
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:43,446
<i>that he had forgotten his resolution</i>
<i>to remain a bachelor.</i>

94
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:47,202
<i>He looked his new bride over carefully</i>
<i>and tried to imagine the day</i>

95
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:52,202
<i>when, like his father, grandfather</i>
<i>and great-grandfather before him.</i>

96
00:08:52,253 --> 00:08:55,086
<i>he would want to bludgeon her with a shovel.</i>

97
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:58,682
<i>Being young, his imagination failed him.</i>

98
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:02,043
- Hello, dear boy.
- Hello, Mrs Whiting.

99
00:09:02,093 --> 00:09:06,132
- It's a rogues' gallery, is it not?
- Yep.

100
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:08,641
They were all mad as hatters.

101
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,489
That one, old Elijah,

102
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:16,163
once chased his wife
around this very room with an axe.

103
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:20,291
Nice town. Where is it?

104
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:24,928
Seeing you standing there
gives me a good idea.

105
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:28,004
You should be the mayor.

106
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:31,170
- Of the model?
- No, of the town.

107
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:33,010
Are you offering me the job?

108
00:09:33,053 --> 00:09:37,251
- No, you overestimate my influence.
- Do I?

109
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:40,922
People are always confusing will with power.

110
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:43,089
Your mother was like that.

111
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:48,565
- You wanted to see me.
- I have a surprise for you, dear boy.

112
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:51,173
Come to the house on Tuesday
and I'll show you.

113
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:54,808
It's time we had
our "State of the Grill" meeting, anyway.

114
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:57,321
- Say two o'clock?
- OK.

115
00:09:57,373 --> 00:10:02,049
Incidentally, your father phoned me
three times while you were away.

116
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:04,971
- Asking for money, naturally.
- I'll speak to him.

117
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:08,926
- Please do. He's a pain in the ass.
- You're telling me.

118
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:10,884
Miles.

119
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:14,527
I didn't ask you. How was your vacation?

120
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:15,972
Short.

121
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:19,402
Wonderful, actually.

122
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:23,287
You return to Martha's Vineyard
every summer, don't you?

123
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:26,488
Did it ever occur to you to wonder why?

124
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:31,124
I've got some college friends
who have a house there.

125
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,210
It's the only vacation I can afford.

126
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:39,007
Didn't your mother tell me
that she took you there once?

127
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:41,211
When I was 10, yeah.

128
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:45,802
"And so we beat on,

129
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,686
"boats against the current,

130
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:52,123
- "borne back ceaselessly..."
- "..into the past."

131
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:56,610
- Yes.
- Scott Fitzgerald. I went to college.

132
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:58,962
So you did.

133
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:23,206
<i>You return to Martha's Vineyard</i>
<i>every summer, don't you?</i>

134
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:28,286
OK, this is an adventure, Miles.

135
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:32,609
<i>Let's try to have fun. OK?</i>
<i>It's important to Mommy.</i>

136
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:34,803
When's Dad coming?

137
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:39,242
<i>You'll have to wait till he's out of jail.</i>

138
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:45,131
You didn't know that, did you? That he's in jail.

139
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:46,845
That's a lie.

140
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:52,172
When I was a boy,

141
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:55,250
I thought God actually lived in the steeple.

142
00:11:57,853 --> 00:12:01,812
lmagine God so close,
just a couple of storeys up.

143
00:12:02,573 --> 00:12:04,165
Talk me down, OK?

144
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:07,603
OK, Miles, you're gonna be fine,
just with your right foot.

145
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:10,963
Bring it down nice and easy,
you've got about 12 inches.

146
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:13,607
Now you've got three, two.

147
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:15,723
Yeah, you feel it? There you go.

148
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:18,571
Now the next. Bring your foot back in.

149
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:23,562
- There you are. All right, same thing.
- OK, OK. OK.

150
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:26,081
We agreed
you weren't gonna paint any higher.

151
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:30,172
Yeah, we did, I guess, but every time
I look up there, it's an accusation.

152
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:34,491
- Then don't look up.
- Fine advice for a man of the spirit to give.

153
00:12:37,613 --> 00:12:40,252
Father Tom's making off
with the cashbox again.

154
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:43,171
I know. Don't worry, Miss Koss will fetch him.

155
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:46,125
Come back here, you old fart!

156
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:49,165
Father Tom! Father Tom! Bring that back!

157
00:12:49,213 --> 00:12:51,773
Who says God has no sense of humour?

158
00:13:00,053 --> 00:13:02,248
Tick Roby!

159
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:05,490
Just make way for Tick Roby, make way here.

160
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:07,251
Just keep walking.

161
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,605
She's got a horny new friend.

162
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:13,965
My God, Zack Minty is so hot.
I can't believe you broke up with him.

163
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:17,808
Loser.

164
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:22,888
Yo, it's Mr Mayer. We're busted.

165
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:24,924
Let's go. We're out of here.

166
00:13:25,493 --> 00:13:27,484
You OK, John?

167
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:30,452
Christina!

168
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:36,930
I looked at your schedule.

169
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:41,171
The only way that you can take art
is to have lunch during sixth period.

170
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:44,967
- You'd be the only one in the cafeteria.
- That's OK.

171
00:13:45,013 --> 00:13:47,686
Actually, I prefer to eat alone.

172
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:49,485
Good.

173
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:19,090
On him.

174
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:24,726
You've got stuff in your beard, Dad,
you know that?

175
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:26,923
So what?

176
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:29,009
You look like the village idiot.

177
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:37,965
Mrs Whiting says
you've been calling her again.

178
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:41,608
Why shouldn't I? We're related, her and me.

179
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:46,322
The Robys and the Robideaux
are the same family if you go back far enough.

180
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:48,204
You wish.

181
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:54,846
You should let me help you paint that church.
I was a housepainter for 40 years, you know.

182
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:57,965
You keep forgetting,
I'm painting the church for free.

183
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:02,723
- That don't mean you can't pay me.
- Yeah, it does. That's precisely what it means.

184
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:05,492
How can I get down to the Keys
with no money?

185
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:08,969
You managed when I was a kid.
You disappeared every winter.

186
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:13,689
- That's where the money was.
- How come we never saw any of it?

187
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:18,204
If you paid me to paint that church,
I wouldn't have to feel worthless.

188
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:22,450
Ain't no law
that says old people got to feel worthless.

189
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:25,644
If you paid me, I might have some dignity.

190
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:29,686
The dignity ship sailed years ago, Dad.
Decades.

191
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:36,405
- Trying to hurt my feelings, but you can't.
- Any time you feel like an infusion of dignity,

192
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:39,331
come down to the restaurant
and wash dishes for a while.

193
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:41,204
That your idea of dignity?

194
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:44,450
Cooped up in a back room,
no windows, minimum wage,

195
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:47,371
half of it goes to the government.

196
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,610
Now, I would let you hire me

197
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:53,087
if you let me work the grill.

198
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:55,727
Ain't nothing to flipping burgers
and I like to talk to people.

199
00:15:55,773 --> 00:16:00,324
I'd have to run you through the Hobart first,
wash some of that stuff out of your beard.

200
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:02,762
I may be 70, but I can climb like a monkey.

201
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:05,964
I don't get scared up on a ladder
like a little girl.

202
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:09,369
It works both ways, Dad,
you can't hurt my feelings either.

203
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:11,404
I gotta pee.

204
00:16:17,373 --> 00:16:19,364
Hey, old buddy.

205
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,808
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Long time no see.

206
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:25,651
- That your dad?
- Yeah. Want a cup of coffee?

207
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,924
No, no time. I'm glad I ran into you, though.

208
00:16:28,973 --> 00:16:31,806
- I thought about you the other day.
- How's that?

209
00:16:31,853 --> 00:16:35,641
I was in the old neighbourhood. Spring Street.

210
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:37,684
- Ever get over there?
- Not really.

211
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:41,521
Just as well. Break your heart.
Drug neighbourhood now.

212
00:16:41,573 --> 00:16:45,532
Every other house falling down.
I go to visit there every now and then.

213
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:49,612
Just sit there,
across the street from my old man's place.

214
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:55,692
Yours next door. Half expect
to see your ma to come out on her porch.

215
00:16:55,733 --> 00:17:00,045
She and my dad never got along too good,
but I always liked her.

216
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:04,371
- Awful way to go like she did.
- Let's change the subject, OK?

217
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:07,367
Sure.

218
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:11,970
Anyway, I was saying,
sometimes I'll drive over there

219
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:15,403
and just sit by the kerb
and try to figure it all out.

220
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:17,444
All what out?

221
00:17:18,613 --> 00:17:23,687
Life, the way things turn out. Some folks would
think it's pretty weird, me ending up a cop.

222
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,724
Not me, Jimmy.

223
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:31,811
My old man is what I meant.
He had his run-ins with the law over the years.

224
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:35,482
- It's probably why your ma had it in for him.
- Yeah, sure.

225
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:40,323
I saw him beat one of them union organisers
half to death outside the old shirt factory.

226
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:44,366
Course, old man Whiting put him up to it so...
You know, gave him the nod.

227
00:17:45,293 --> 00:17:50,048
And now here we are, 30 years later,
both working for old Francine.

228
00:17:50,093 --> 00:17:52,402
As a policeman,
I thought you worked for the city.

229
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:56,765
Yeah? You tell me that woman
and Empire Falls ain't the same thing.

230
00:17:56,813 --> 00:18:00,328
OK, they're not the same thing.

231
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,722
Maybe. Maybe not.

232
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:09,923
How's that cute little girl of yours?

233
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:13,568
Good, good.
Happier than she's been in some time.

234
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:15,922
Wanna know a secret?

235
00:18:15,973 --> 00:18:18,567
I think my Zack's still sweet on her.

236
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:22,845
I told him at the time,
he should've let her down gently.

237
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,893
Jimmy Minty!

238
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:32,642
My God!
What a stupid kid you were growing up.

239
00:18:32,693 --> 00:18:35,890
- How the hell are you?
- Just fine. How are you doing, Mr Roby?

240
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:40,131
I don't think I can remember anybody
as untalented as Jimmy here.

241
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:42,368
My God, it was pitiful.

242
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:46,372
But I guess that is a lesson to us all.

243
00:18:46,413 --> 00:18:49,211
Never give up on a child.

244
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,845
Now...

245
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:54,732
..Miles here is just the opposite.

246
00:18:54,773 --> 00:18:57,367
Straight A's all the way through school.

247
00:18:57,413 --> 00:19:00,883
I would've sworn
he would've growed up having a good heart

248
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:05,643
and when his own father needed
a helping hand, he'd be right there.

249
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:10,050
- But apparently not.
- Why don't you go get in the car, Dad?

250
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:14,052
Cos I'm having a conversation
with Jimmy Minty here.

251
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:19,372
He may not be gifted like you,
but I'll bet he can follow what I'm saying.

252
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:23,524
To tell you the truth,

253
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:27,566
I would rather have a complete idiot
for a child

254
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:29,444
than an ingrate.

255
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:31,927
I gotta go, Mr Roby. Hey, Miles?

256
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:33,727
Yeah?

257
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,765
- Take a little walk with me?
- Yeah, sure.

258
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,927
- Thanks, Mr Roby.
- Thank you, Ryan.

259
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:46,808
Dick!

260
00:19:47,293 --> 00:19:50,205
I didn't want to bring this up around your dad.

261
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:54,246
There's a lot of dope around town right now
so tell your brother to be careful.

262
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,568
Why should David be careful?

263
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,730
He's your brother. I'm just saying, is all.

264
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:01,764
A word to the wise, right?

265
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:10,362
Look, you don't know a damn thing
about my brother.

266
00:20:10,413 --> 00:20:13,928
- Everyone knows he's growing dope out there.
- I don't.

267
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:16,362
I can't help thinking
how bad your ma would feel.

268
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:19,610
- You know even less about my mother.
- I didn't mean...

269
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:22,451
So don't bring her up
in any more conversations, OK?

270
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:24,961
- Miles...
- No, just shut up and listen.

271
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:30,201
You didn't know her.

272
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:33,849
Say that, so I know you understand.

273
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:38,451
You shouldn't tell me to shut up in public.

274
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:41,053
This badge entitles me to respect.

275
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:47,810
You're right.
It's just that my family is off-limits. OK?

276
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:50,682
Sure.

277
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:56,531
So did you find what you were looking for?

278
00:20:56,573 --> 00:21:00,612
All $10. I was gonna tell you,
you never give me a chance.

279
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:04,441
Will you stop picking at that?
It's holding the seat together.

280
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:14,602
What are you doing with
a Martha's Vineyard real estate guide?

281
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:17,213
Boy, that would be just like you.

282
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:20,165
Move to an island, leave me here.

283
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:23,523
Every time I want to visit my granddaughter,
I gotta swim.

284
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,565
Yeah, well, it would do you good.

285
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:29,411
Wash some of those crumbs
out of your beard.

286
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:38,803
Mrs Rodrigue catches you with that,
it's big trouble.

287
00:21:38,853 --> 00:21:42,528
She won't come over here.
She hates the blue table.

288
00:21:43,613 --> 00:21:47,367
God, oh, my God, you're almost done!
I haven't even started.

289
00:21:47,413 --> 00:21:51,088
Help me, OK? What's my most vivid dream?

290
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:53,601
I don't know any of your dreams.

291
00:21:58,373 --> 00:22:00,728
You should get back together with Zack Minty.

292
00:22:00,773 --> 00:22:03,446
- Yeah.
- He so does not like his new girlfriend.

293
00:22:03,493 --> 00:22:05,927
And you should see how he treats her.

294
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:09,648
I know how he treats her.
That's how he used to treat me.

295
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:11,490
What?

296
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:16,924
Hey, Candace, John says he wants
to meet you in the parking lot after school.

297
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:19,931
He says he's got something to show you!

298
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:22,771
Shut up, you asshole!

299
00:22:22,813 --> 00:22:26,203
I'll tolerate no more disturbances
from the blue table.

300
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:33,683
My God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

301
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:37,530
What have you done?
Tell me what you've done.

302
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:39,450
Oh, my heavens.

303
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:42,166
Go see the nurse, child.

304
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:45,011
Christina, you're not going to puke, are you?

305
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:46,452
- No.
- All right.

306
00:23:27,053 --> 00:23:29,442
Damn it, Miles, you scared me.

307
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:31,370
I just wanted to say hi.

308
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:35,370
Hey, welcome back.

309
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:38,401
- Thanks.
- Now, go away and let me finish my joint.

310
00:23:38,453 --> 00:23:40,921
I'm not comfortable smoking dope around you.

311
00:23:40,973 --> 00:23:42,167
Why?

312
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:45,410
You can never quite manage
to conceal your disapproval.

313
00:23:45,453 --> 00:23:47,444
Actually, I was...

314
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:57,410
I don't eat onions, Miles.

315
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:02,123
I know you've been away
but I haven't changed.

316
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:04,368
I read The Globe, I write for The Sentinel,

317
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:08,167
I never send Christmas cards
and I don't eat onions.

318
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:13,490
Thank you.

319
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:20,891
Your favourite customer.

320
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:36,527
- Good afternoon, ladies, good afternoon.
- Perry Como, right on time.

321
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:38,404
Hey, big boy, big boy.

322
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:42,330
Take a look at me. I'm 50.

323
00:24:42,373 --> 00:24:45,570
50 years old,
I got the body of a 40-year-old.

324
00:24:46,933 --> 00:24:49,845
Come on. Come on, let me see what you got.

325
00:24:50,453 --> 00:24:55,766
If you pin me, I'll give you one free month
membership at my health club.

326
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:58,922
Which, by the way, you could use.

327
00:24:58,973 --> 00:25:03,171
And excuse me, Mr Reporter Man,
but do you have any idea at all

328
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:07,331
about how many pounds
of undigested animal fat

329
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:10,968
most people have in their bodies
when they die?

330
00:25:11,013 --> 00:25:13,481
- Delicious.
- Very funny.

331
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:19,410
- Well? Did you hear about the mill?
- Jeez, here we go again.

332
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:22,650
- What?
- Let him tell it and then it'll be over.

333
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:24,888
- Go ahead, white limo...
- That's right...

334
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:27,527
A white limo with Massachusetts plates.

335
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:31,168
Are you gonna tell it, big boy?
You weren't even here, OK?

336
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:34,250
Go ahead, tell it.
Drove right down Empire Avenue.

337
00:25:34,293 --> 00:25:39,765
A white limousine with Massachusetts plates
drove right down Empire Avenue,

338
00:25:39,813 --> 00:25:43,522
pulled into the old textile mill,
and who do you think gets out?

339
00:25:43,573 --> 00:25:46,167
A bunch of guys in $600 suits with shiny shoes

340
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:49,410
who'll buy the mill
and give everybody their old jobs back.

341
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:51,648
At $20 an hour.

342
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:53,923
Well, then, why don't you explain it?

343
00:25:54,973 --> 00:25:58,648
- You saw it, this limo?
- Everybody saw it.

344
00:25:58,693 --> 00:26:01,161
No, that's not what I asked.

345
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:03,010
Did you see it?

346
00:26:06,373 --> 00:26:11,128
- You know what? The hell with you guys.
- Same rumour circulates this time every year.

347
00:26:11,173 --> 00:26:15,883
All I'm saying is that we could get lucky.
Something good could happen here someday.

348
00:26:15,933 --> 00:26:20,006
- This used to be a prosperous town, right?
- All right, let's get started here.

349
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:22,248
I have no time to toy with you today.

350
00:26:22,293 --> 00:26:25,285
Not today. Today I kick your ass.

351
00:26:25,893 --> 00:26:29,442
- Anything is possible.
- But see, that's what I'm saying.

352
00:26:29,493 --> 00:26:32,849
I've been saying that somebody
could buy the mill.

353
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:36,203
- The whole town could go back to work.
- Somebody shoot him.

354
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:40,246
Tell me something, bro.
Why do you allow him in here?

355
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:44,491
He just comes in here to make sure
I know there are no hard feelings.

356
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:47,445
He steals your wife
and there are no hard feelings?

357
00:26:47,493 --> 00:26:53,090
Some sins trail their own penance.
Anyway, it's against the law to refuse service.

358
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:57,206
Yeah, so is murder.
It'dbe an elegant solution just the same.

359
00:26:57,253 --> 00:26:58,971
Gin!

360
00:27:00,253 --> 00:27:02,528
You just dealt.

361
00:27:02,573 --> 00:27:04,803
Nevertheless.

362
00:27:04,853 --> 00:27:07,162
You've got to be kidding me.

363
00:27:07,213 --> 00:27:09,283
He's kidding. Girls, he's kidding.

364
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:13,565
How was the Vineyard?

365
00:27:13,613 --> 00:27:18,323
Tick met a boy. Donny.
But don't tease her about it, though.

366
00:27:18,373 --> 00:27:21,012
- You should've fought Janine for custody.
- No.

367
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:24,648
Once they're married, what if they move away
and take her with them?

368
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:27,253
Tick is the one thing she can't have.

369
00:27:27,293 --> 00:27:32,003
Anyway, Walt likes it here and who would
Janine blame for things if I'm not handy?

370
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:38,325
- Hiya, sweetie pie.
- Hi, Uncle David.

371
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:40,728
Hello, beautiful.

372
00:27:41,853 --> 00:27:43,445
- How are you?
- Good.

373
00:27:43,493 --> 00:27:45,688
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

374
00:27:49,693 --> 00:27:54,289
So I hear you had a nice time on the Vineyard.

375
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:58,485
Yeah. There is a bookstore for sale
on the beach road.

376
00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:01,923
- If Daddy bought it, we could live there.
- Hey, Tick.

377
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:05,761
Hey, big boy.
You got a fitness club on that island?

378
00:28:05,813 --> 00:28:09,203
- I've been thinking of expanding.
- There's a lot of 'em, Walt.

379
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:12,452
Did David tell you how business is picking up?

380
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:20,007
You should have seen her last week.

381
00:28:20,053 --> 00:28:23,329
She was like her old self
before all that shit started raining down.

382
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:26,604
<i>She had a smile on her face all week.</i>

383
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,324
<i>You should think about that bookstore.</i>

384
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:37,804
There's no way. Not until I can sell this place
and I can't do that until it's mine to sell.

385
00:28:37,853 --> 00:28:41,641
What makes you think that Whiting woman
will ever give you this restaurant?

386
00:28:41,693 --> 00:28:44,890
That was our deal.
I run the place till she dies, then it's mine.

387
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:48,721
- I saw the will, David.
- You saw a will, you mean. 20 years ago.

388
00:28:48,773 --> 00:28:51,924
How many times it's been amended since
is what you don't know.

389
00:28:51,973 --> 00:28:54,567
- You know how old her mother lived to be?
- No.

390
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:56,808
That's because she's still alive.

391
00:28:57,893 --> 00:29:02,648
Out in a nursing home in Fairhaven.
In her mid-90s.

392
00:29:04,973 --> 00:29:06,565
Gin!

393
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:09,569
Anything's possible?

394
00:29:12,573 --> 00:29:15,041
How was school?

395
00:29:15,093 --> 00:29:16,890
Crappy.

396
00:29:17,893 --> 00:29:22,489
Now I'm not with Zack Minty and his friends,
I don't have any friends.

397
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:31,763
What about, you know, what's-her-name?
Your new friend?

398
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,405
- Candace?
- Yeah.

399
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:36,604
Oh, my God, I forgot Candace!

400
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:39,042
- Yeah, and you forgot me.
- I know.

401
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:43,405
Yeah, and you forgot your Uncle David.
And your mom.

402
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:47,925
And Donny, you forgot Donny.

403
00:29:47,973 --> 00:29:50,362
I'm never gonna hear from him again.

404
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:53,530
The Silver Fox says e-mail costs too much.

405
00:29:53,573 --> 00:29:55,404
How come? Why?

406
00:29:55,453 --> 00:29:59,048
Why is it that you always have my gin card?
Why? Why?

407
00:29:59,093 --> 00:30:03,291
If I told you that,
you'd be even angrier than you are now.

408
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:09,083
I can't believe you're just gonna let Mom
marry him. I mean, think about me.

409
00:30:10,453 --> 00:30:14,924
He's trying. He just hasn't figured out
how to be around you yet.

410
00:30:14,973 --> 00:30:17,362
Yeah? He could try being dead.

411
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:22,128
- Tick...
- I know. Sorry.

412
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:57,288
Hey, dickhead, what are you doing?

413
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,528
Shopping? Let me see that.

414
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:04,762
You know what? I think this is your size.

415
00:31:04,813 --> 00:31:08,362
You know what?
I think there's only one real way of being sure.

416
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:11,132
You gotta try it on.

417
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:12,572
No!

418
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:20,131
- Nice tan.
- Man, too bad looks can't kill, dickhead?

419
00:31:24,453 --> 00:31:26,444
- Shit.
- Let's get outta here.

420
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:28,723
- It's Chief Daws.
- Calm down.

421
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:32,408
- Hurry up.
- Shotgun!

422
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:53,444
Zack Minty?

423
00:31:55,853 --> 00:31:59,129
You OK? You're the Voss boy, right?

424
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:04,767
- Wanna come down the station, file a report?
- No.

425
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:08,926
No. OK, then.

426
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:12,485
Here.

427
00:32:14,013 --> 00:32:16,004
Need this?

428
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:18,248
Go on, take it.

429
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:22,970
You know where we are. Chief Daws.

430
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:10,242
I don't think Mrs Rodrigue likes my snake.

431
00:33:10,293 --> 00:33:14,764
- What doesn't she like about it?
- Well, you see, that's the thing.

432
00:33:14,813 --> 00:33:17,885
I think it reminds her of real snakes.

433
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:21,403
If true, that means the better I draw the snake,

434
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:25,162
the more it'll remind her of what she hates
and the worse grade I'll get.

435
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:29,411
Hence, if I want a good grade,
I should draw the snake badly.

436
00:33:29,453 --> 00:33:31,045
Or not draw a snake.

437
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:34,608
The assignment was to draw
our most vivid dream. That's mine.

438
00:33:34,653 --> 00:33:38,612
You mistrust your teacher's judgment
of the merits of your drawing, correct?

439
00:33:38,653 --> 00:33:41,645
- Correct.
- Hence, you might as well mistrust

440
00:33:41,693 --> 00:33:43,888
her judgment of the merits of the assignment.

441
00:33:43,933 --> 00:33:45,924
- Right.
- Draw her an angel.

442
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:50,012
- But I'm dreaming of snakes.
- It's not her business what you're dreaming of.

443
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:54,681
- Hey, eat.
- I am.

444
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,724
- You am?
- She's done pretty well.

445
00:33:56,773 --> 00:34:02,484
No, Miles, you've done pretty well. Don't be
telling me you haven't. I've been watching.

446
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:06,970
It's not nice to tell a person's secrets.
I don't go around telling your secrets.

447
00:34:07,013 --> 00:34:09,129
That's where you're smart.

448
00:34:12,773 --> 00:34:15,162
Charlene has secrets?

449
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:18,327
Well...

450
00:34:20,813 --> 00:34:25,204
You see, Mom bet Walt
that when the divorce is final,

451
00:34:25,253 --> 00:34:27,847
you'll ask Charlene to marry you.

452
00:34:27,893 --> 00:34:30,453
Really?

453
00:34:30,493 --> 00:34:34,168
She says you've been in love with her
since high school.

454
00:34:34,213 --> 00:34:38,729
That you even took a job here after school
just so you could be near her.

455
00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:41,207
Well, your mother says a lot of things.

456
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,931
13 up.

457
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:50,763
Here she is.

458
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:57,002
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hi.

459
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:02,124
You look beautiful. 120?

460
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:05,165
- 125.
- Impossible. I'll have that scale checked.

461
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:07,408
- You're 120, tops.
- All right.

462
00:35:08,893 --> 00:35:11,851
- Hello, you two.
- Hi. You're early.

463
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:16,489
Also hot and sweaty.
Don't be staring at my boobs, Miles.

464
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:20,208
We were married 20 years,
they never interested you the whole time.

465
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:22,244
- You ready to go?
- I guess.

466
00:35:22,293 --> 00:35:25,330
You guess. And who would know for sure?

467
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,682
Could somebody give us a definitive answer?

468
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:30,486
I have to get my backpack.

469
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:36,929
- Do you always have to be such a bitch?
- Yes. You'll understand when you're 40.

470
00:35:36,973 --> 00:35:39,567
- You're 41.
- God damn, that's good.

471
00:35:39,613 --> 00:35:42,491
You could order some, Janine.
It wouldn't kill you to eat.

472
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:45,684
Yeah. You'd like it if I got fat again,
wouldn't you?

473
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:48,930
There's a word for people like you - enabler.

474
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:53,610
- I really hate it when you do that.
- What?

475
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:55,644
When you don't say what you're thinking.

476
00:35:55,693 --> 00:35:58,412
You thought, "Yeah, there's a word
for people like you, too."

477
00:35:58,453 --> 00:36:01,445
I saw that thought scroll across your forehead
but you wouldn't say it.

478
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,006
Dear God.

479
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:06,489
- You guys fighting?
- Yes. Wait in the car if you're squeamish.

480
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:08,171
Love to.

481
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:10,204
- Bye.
- Bye, baby.

482
00:36:10,773 --> 00:36:13,241
- Hey, I saw a great one today, Daddy.
- Yeah?

483
00:36:13,293 --> 00:36:17,445
Know that old gay bar on Fairhaven Road?
Their sign says "Enter In Rear."

484
00:36:18,773 --> 00:36:22,368
That's a good one. 10-pointer.
You're back in the lead.

485
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:26,884
- Good night.
- Good night, baby. Sweet dreams.

486
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:30,084
- You don't have to be so tough on her.
- Somebody has to be.

487
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:32,931
- She's just a kid.
- Miles, you're wrong.

488
00:36:32,973 --> 00:36:36,761
Just look at her. Try using the same eyes
you look at other people with.

489
00:36:36,813 --> 00:36:38,531
I'm not gonna argue with you.

490
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:43,124
The last 20 years have been about
us not arguing. Well, I feel like arguing!

491
00:36:43,173 --> 00:36:45,368
- 120, tops.
- I love you!

492
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:49,008
- I love you more.
- We did really well last week.

493
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:54,047
- If you'd let me have custody...
- And she'd sleep where? Upstairs?

494
00:36:54,093 --> 00:36:57,085
You gonna move those pallets
of Frialator grease?

495
00:36:57,133 --> 00:37:00,443
I'm the one who ended up without a house.
Speaking of which...

496
00:37:00,493 --> 00:37:05,089
Don't. Don't go there.
I did speak to him about buying you out.

497
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:07,567
He's renting out his own house
and living in mine...

498
00:37:07,613 --> 00:37:10,923
He's sifting through
some investment opportunities, OK?

499
00:37:10,973 --> 00:37:13,168
- Come on!
- You should be happy.

500
00:37:13,213 --> 00:37:17,764
A month from now, I'll be Mrs Walt Comeau
and all you'll owe is child support.

501
00:37:17,813 --> 00:37:21,283
- If you hadn't dragged your feet...
- The courthouse burned down!

502
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:24,723
Please, you stalled and stalled, Miles,
and we both know it.

503
00:37:24,773 --> 00:37:30,211
It wouldn't surprise me if you'd torched it just
to keep me from being happy and having a life!

504
00:37:31,053 --> 00:37:34,648
Do you know what I still don't understand? Us.

505
00:37:34,693 --> 00:37:39,244
I told you everything you did that pissed me off
during the whole 20 years, right?

506
00:37:39,293 --> 00:37:42,490
- That's true.
- I'm getting ready to marry somebody else

507
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:46,526
and you still haven't told me
why you didn't love me.

508
00:37:46,573 --> 00:37:48,882
- Is that fair?
- You took up with Walt.

509
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,322
- Sure, throw that in my face.
- What...

510
00:37:51,373 --> 00:37:53,682
No, it's not fair and you know it.

511
00:37:55,093 --> 00:37:58,688
I took up with Walt
because he loved me and you didn't.

512
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:03,370
Now, I know what I did hurt your feelings,

513
00:38:03,413 --> 00:38:08,009
but you shouldn't pretend
you were in love with me because you weren't.

514
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:10,772
What is my part in this conversation?
If you're gonna speak...

515
00:38:10,813 --> 00:38:13,885
Are you trying to tell me you love me?

516
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:19,250
If that's what you want to say,
I'll shut up so you can.

517
00:38:24,853 --> 00:38:27,048
That's what I thought.

518
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:36,733
Why are you tormenting yourself? If being with
Walt makes you happy, what else matters?

519
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,764
Beats the shit out of me.

520
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:43,443
Just once I'd like to hear you say
I'm not a horrible person.

521
00:38:43,493 --> 00:38:46,883
- I never said you...
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

522
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:48,924
You never said anything.

523
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:15,332
Tab's full, old man. God, you smell.
When's the last time you had a bath?

524
00:39:15,373 --> 00:39:18,285
- Hello, Bea.
- Hi. You working late?

525
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:21,131
Yes, covering the school board meeting.

526
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:27,844
- Want one, Max?
- Sure.

527
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:34,249
- How'd that go?
- The usual.

528
00:39:34,293 --> 00:39:37,490
And draw one of those for my friend here.

529
00:39:37,533 --> 00:39:41,208
Yes, they were civil for about two minutes.

530
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:45,246
And after that uncivil for a while,
then rude, then insulting.

531
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:47,488
It stopped just short of fisticuffs.

532
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:51,090
I don't know if I've told you, Bea, but...

533
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:55,884
in my experience...

534
00:39:56,893 --> 00:40:01,284
most human beings
are selfish, greedy, venal, unprincipled,

535
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:04,882
utterly irredeemable shit-eaters.

536
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:07,922
So I have mentioned it?

537
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:12,091
- You should have that thing removed.
- Max.

538
00:40:14,853 --> 00:40:16,332
What thing?

539
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:21,163
I'm always afraid that it's going to explode
when I'm talking to you.

540
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:26,082
- What would it cost you to have it cut off?
- Don't know, never looked into it.

541
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:28,328
Oh, boy, I would've.

542
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:33,606
If I had that thing growing out of my forehead,
I'd have had it looked into, pronto.

543
00:40:33,653 --> 00:40:38,124
I don't know, Max, I think it might be
the source of my intelligence.

544
00:40:40,053 --> 00:40:44,490
What if I had it cut off, then found
it was responsible for all my best ideas?

545
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:50,211
Have you ever been to Florida?

546
00:40:50,253 --> 00:40:51,845
No.

547
00:40:51,893 --> 00:40:53,884
You would like Key West.

548
00:40:53,933 --> 00:40:57,050
- Hemingway lived there.
- Hemingway?

549
00:40:57,093 --> 00:40:59,448
Yeah, hell of a fellow.

550
00:40:59,493 --> 00:41:01,484
You met Ernest Hemingway?

551
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:05,082
Papa. His friends called him Papa.

552
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:07,727
No, what I asked was, "Did you meet him?"

553
00:41:07,773 --> 00:41:12,563
Drank a lot of beer there over the years.
He could've been on the next barstool.

554
00:41:12,613 --> 00:41:15,969
I bet there was at least one stool between you.

555
00:41:16,013 --> 00:41:19,608
What was the first year
that you went down there?

556
00:41:19,653 --> 00:41:21,848
Winter, '69.

557
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:25,452
Then you never sat next to Hemingway.

558
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:29,332
He shot himself in the head in '61.

559
00:41:32,173 --> 00:41:37,964
You and I should go down there sometime.
The women walk around there half-naked.

560
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:44,246
There's a bar down there,
the girls just take their bras off.

561
00:41:45,573 --> 00:41:47,370
They nail them to the ceiling.

562
00:41:47,413 --> 00:41:51,691
- I'm free any time you want to go.
- No, I don't think so, Max.

563
00:41:51,733 --> 00:41:55,203
All those naked girls. I might get depressed.

564
00:41:55,253 --> 00:41:57,687
End up shooting myself. That's it.

565
00:41:58,413 --> 00:42:00,005
Oh, yeah?

566
00:42:00,813 --> 00:42:03,805
Well, try to miss that thing on your forehead.

567
00:42:05,493 --> 00:42:09,202
My God, what a mess that'd make!

568
00:42:20,053 --> 00:42:22,647
- Hey, pretty good night.
- Yeah.

569
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:26,891
Wait till the weekend
after all the college kids get back.

570
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:31,529
I'm not 100% sure we got our costs in line
on the new menu, but...

571
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:34,324
it's gotta be pretty close.

572
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:40,170
Which is why I keep telling you,
now's the time to make our move.

573
00:42:40,773 --> 00:42:43,685
If we went partners
with your mother-in-law at Callahans,

574
00:42:43,733 --> 00:42:48,329
she'd do the liquor, we'd provide the food,
better for both of us.

575
00:42:48,373 --> 00:42:51,171
Why let Francine Whiting
keep pulling all the strings?

576
00:42:51,213 --> 00:42:55,331
- Cos I owe her, David.
- You owe her? You owe her nothing.

577
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:58,763
She could've gotten rid of this place years ago.
Where would that have left me?

578
00:42:58,813 --> 00:43:02,123
- Free?
- And Janine and Tick.

579
00:43:02,173 --> 00:43:05,165
When Mom was sick,
who do you think paid her medical bills?

580
00:43:05,213 --> 00:43:09,126
At college, I had to come up with $500
every semester for books and fees.

581
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:12,768
Where do you think that came from?
Mom sure didn't get it from Dad.

582
00:43:12,813 --> 00:43:17,409
At least we're finally talking
about the right person. Mom.

583
00:43:17,453 --> 00:43:22,049
- No need to tell me how much I owe her.
- How much was it, the bookstore?

584
00:43:23,453 --> 00:43:27,890
Well, it was more like a book barn, actually.

585
00:43:28,533 --> 00:43:31,684
New books, a little café downstairs,

586
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:35,123
used books upstairs,
a nice little cottage out back.

587
00:43:42,493 --> 00:43:44,688
- And?
- What?

588
00:43:44,733 --> 00:43:46,928
How much was it?

589
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:53,969
Look, I can't make snap decisions like you do.
OK? I've got Tick to think about.

590
00:43:54,013 --> 00:43:58,291
I must've been doing 100 when I ploughed
through that guardrail down into that ravine.

591
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:01,325
I'd still be hanging up in a pine tree
by my hunting vest

592
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:04,410
if I hadn't peed
on that deer hunter the next morning.

593
00:44:04,453 --> 00:44:07,172
I'm glad you're not drinking any more,
but what's your point?

594
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:09,204
Playing it safe can be just as dangerous.

595
00:44:09,253 --> 00:44:12,723
If you aren't careful,
Tick'll be the next manager of the Empire Grill.

596
00:44:12,773 --> 00:44:15,003
Another generation under her thumb.

597
00:44:15,053 --> 00:44:19,046
- Over my dead body.
- Now we've come full circle.

598
00:44:19,093 --> 00:44:23,291
That's what Mom always
used to say about you.

599
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:28,532
And yet here you are,
stuck running this place nearly 25 years.

600
00:44:28,573 --> 00:44:34,284
And Mom, what did she do? Ten years in the
Whiting household looking after young Cindy?

601
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,324
Which reminds me.

602
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:41,483
This was in the newspaper
when you were gone.

603
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:51,090
Tell me something. Are you growing dope?

604
00:44:52,093 --> 00:44:54,926
Cos Jimmy Minty seems to think you are.

605
00:44:56,573 --> 00:44:59,565
Jimmy Minty actually thinks?

606
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,328
That's Mom in the top right corner.

607
00:45:06,653 --> 00:45:09,008
What a comedown?

608
00:45:09,053 --> 00:45:11,647
Office manager to chief maid.

609
00:45:12,653 --> 00:45:16,726
She'd been turning over in her grave
if she knew you were still here.

610
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:19,930
<i>Why did they fire you?</i>

611
00:45:21,573 --> 00:45:24,371
They fired a lot of people, not just me.

612
00:45:24,413 --> 00:45:26,404
But why did they fire you?

613
00:45:29,573 --> 00:45:33,168
I wasn't the only one, you know.
Mom had plans for you, too.

614
00:45:33,213 --> 00:45:36,922
I know. She told me exactly
what she wanted me to do before she died.

615
00:45:36,973 --> 00:45:38,770
Yeah, what was that?

616
00:45:38,813 --> 00:45:42,283
She said, "David, look after your brother."

617
00:45:44,893 --> 00:45:48,090
- She didn't say that.
- She did say that.

618
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:52,052
Why don't you take the wheel, Miles?

619
00:45:55,133 --> 00:45:58,603
<i>Get out of here, Max. Go on, go on.</i>

620
00:45:59,133 --> 00:46:00,851
Go.

621
00:46:00,893 --> 00:46:02,849
Good night, old man.

622
00:46:06,853 --> 00:46:11,404
<i>Who, after all, arrives at his heart's home</i>
<i>at the end of the day?</i>

623
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:25,526
<i>Given this day,</i>
<i>who can say that the next will bring joy?</i>

624
00:46:25,573 --> 00:46:27,370
Good boy.

625
00:46:32,133 --> 00:46:34,328
Yes! Yes!

626
00:46:39,693 --> 00:46:41,092
<i>Or comfort?</i>

627
00:46:41,773 --> 00:46:44,162
Your tea is ready.

628
00:46:44,213 --> 00:46:47,011
You old goat, you're disgusting.

629
00:46:47,053 --> 00:46:49,044
You forgot your pants again.

630
00:46:49,093 --> 00:46:51,527
Honestly, Father Tom!

631
00:46:59,093 --> 00:47:01,084
<i>Or justice?</i>

632
00:47:07,773 --> 00:47:09,764
<i>Or release?</i>

633
00:47:12,493 --> 00:47:14,688
<i>Or an end to care?</i>

634
00:47:43,613 --> 00:47:45,683
<i>Lives are like rivers.</i>

635
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:48,452
<i>Eventually they go where they must,</i>

636
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:51,648
<i>not where we want them to.</i>

637
00:48:35,253 --> 00:48:38,370
Cindy, I had no idea you were home.

638
00:48:38,413 --> 00:48:41,371
I so wanted to surprise you and I have,
haven't I?

639
00:48:41,413 --> 00:48:43,449
Let me have a look at you.

640
00:48:44,693 --> 00:48:46,684
You look great.

641
00:48:48,373 --> 00:48:49,772
- You OK?
- Yeah.

642
00:48:49,813 --> 00:48:51,804
Take it easy.

643
00:48:52,573 --> 00:48:55,292
So how are you?

644
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:58,370
Well, Miles, I'm so, so well.

645
00:48:58,413 --> 00:49:00,608
The doctors are amazed.

646
00:49:00,653 --> 00:49:02,962
I haven't had any setbacks in...

647
00:49:04,413 --> 00:49:06,449
so long.

648
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:10,725
It seems I'm to begin life again
as a normal person.

649
00:49:10,773 --> 00:49:14,243
- You can congratulate me.
- That's wonderful, Cindy.

650
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,842
<i>Cindy Whiting.</i>

651
00:49:17,893 --> 00:49:21,647
<i>She'd been only three</i>
<i>when she was run over outside their home,</i>

652
00:49:21,693 --> 00:49:23,684
<i>the driver never apprehended.</i>

653
00:49:23,733 --> 00:49:26,725
<i>One desperate heartbreaking operation</i>
<i>after another</i>

654
00:49:26,773 --> 00:49:31,927
<i>had left her as crippled of mind and spirit</i>
<i>as she was of limb.</i>

655
00:49:33,213 --> 00:49:37,729
I'm staying here at present.
Just until I find a place of my own.

656
00:49:37,773 --> 00:49:41,607
A grown woman needs a place
to come and go as she pleases

657
00:49:41,653 --> 00:49:44,884
and entertain whom she pleases.

658
00:49:46,773 --> 00:49:48,206
Jeez!

659
00:49:48,253 --> 00:49:51,051
Timmy, it's only Miles.

660
00:49:54,053 --> 00:49:57,841
- You don't want to hurt him.
- Like hell she doesn't.

661
00:50:01,613 --> 00:50:04,810
It's Mother. She must have heard you drive up.

662
00:50:05,813 --> 00:50:09,010
She's waiting for you in the gazebo.

663
00:50:09,053 --> 00:50:13,092
-You go along, I'm slow.
-That's OK. Let her wait.

664
00:50:21,133 --> 00:50:24,808
She loves the sound of Mother's bell
for some reason.

665
00:50:25,293 --> 00:50:29,002
- Cindy, I wanted to tell you...
- No, Miles.

666
00:50:29,053 --> 00:50:33,012
I heard about you and Janine. I'm so sorry.

667
00:50:34,693 --> 00:50:37,082
You never loved her, Miles.

668
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:39,169
You know you didn't.

669
00:50:41,213 --> 00:50:43,204
That's what she says, oddly enough.

670
00:50:45,213 --> 00:50:51,209
I lied, Miles. I'm not sorry. Your divorce
gives me a slender thread of hope.

671
00:50:52,853 --> 00:50:54,969
I still love you, Miles.

672
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:57,129
I know you wish I didn't,

673
00:50:57,173 --> 00:50:59,562
but I can't help it.

674
00:50:59,613 --> 00:51:02,411
It's the one thing the lithium can't touch.

675
00:51:03,133 --> 00:51:06,921
It washes into your brain
and it makes things easier, but...

676
00:51:08,453 --> 00:51:11,047
it can't erase what's here.

677
00:51:12,853 --> 00:51:15,572
It can't change what's here,

678
00:51:15,613 --> 00:51:17,604
what's in a woman's heart.

679
00:51:20,493 --> 00:51:22,290
Cindy.

680
00:51:23,933 --> 00:51:25,525
Cindy.

681
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:30,970
Please.

682
00:51:39,253 --> 00:51:40,971
- Careful
- Yeah, you go.

683
00:51:41,013 --> 00:51:42,810
- You OK?
- Yeah.

684
00:51:42,853 --> 00:51:44,844
You're sure, now?

685
00:51:50,133 --> 00:51:51,407
Damn!

686
00:51:52,173 --> 00:51:54,323
Timmy, you are such a little pill.

687
00:52:02,053 --> 00:52:03,850
Sorry, Miles.

688
00:52:06,933 --> 00:52:11,484
<i>His little girl's accident</i>
<i>changed everything for CB Whiting.</i>

689
00:52:11,533 --> 00:52:15,685
<i>In a heartbeat. he went from thinking</i>
<i>of himself as someone special</i>

690
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:19,089
<i>to someone especially damned.</i>

691
00:52:19,133 --> 00:52:23,126
<i>Was it seeing Cindy's limbs become</i>
<i>more twisted with each passing year</i>

692
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:26,563
<i>that caused his 10-year-long meander</i>
<i>in Mexico?</i>

693
00:52:27,613 --> 00:52:33,370
<i>Was it her continued suffering that finally</i>
<i>lured him back to his own headwaters?</i>

694
00:52:34,413 --> 00:52:38,850
<i>Or was it some darker, selfish impulse?</i>

695
00:52:41,213 --> 00:52:43,090
<i>But that's in a later chapter.</i>

696
00:52:47,853 --> 00:52:52,051
Hello, dear boy. Did you like my surprise?

697
00:52:53,693 --> 00:52:55,684
Would you like some iced tea?

698
00:52:57,853 --> 00:52:59,923
Thank you.

699
00:52:59,973 --> 00:53:03,170
I see you've had another encounter
with Timmy.

700
00:53:04,253 --> 00:53:07,370
It's odd how she hates you so much.

701
00:53:07,413 --> 00:53:09,881
Of course, that little beast detests everyone,

702
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:13,130
but you she seems to hold
in particular contempt.

703
00:53:13,173 --> 00:53:16,370
You should hold a raffle. 10 bucks a chance.

704
00:53:16,413 --> 00:53:19,689
The winner gets to beat her to death
with a baseball bat.

705
00:53:19,733 --> 00:53:23,089
You could fund a new wing of the hospital.

706
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:26,125
Why is it I always forget
you have a sense of humour?

707
00:53:26,173 --> 00:53:29,961
- Did I say something funny?
- You didn't get it from your mother.

708
00:53:30,013 --> 00:53:36,725
She was a sweet woman, but she was not
blessed with a sense of life's grand folly.

709
00:53:36,773 --> 00:53:41,244
Actually, you know, my mother loved to laugh.

710
00:53:41,293 --> 00:53:46,321
- It's harder when you're the butt of the joke.
- Yes, well.

711
00:53:46,373 --> 00:53:49,649
Well, she did have a hard life.

712
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:53,572
However, I've always felt
that people make their own luck.

713
00:53:55,093 --> 00:54:00,850
You needn't smile that smile, Miles Roby.
I know you think I married my luck.

714
00:54:00,893 --> 00:54:04,090
But that opinion is unkind

715
00:54:04,133 --> 00:54:06,124
and it does you no credit.

716
00:54:06,173 --> 00:54:10,132
There is a world of skill
in marrying the right person.

717
00:54:10,173 --> 00:54:12,641
And most people make a complete hash of it.

718
00:54:13,373 --> 00:54:18,401
I wager you have no idea any longer
of why you married.

719
00:54:18,453 --> 00:54:21,445
You'd wager
if you could find somebody to wager with.

720
00:54:21,493 --> 00:54:25,008
You married Janine
in order to escape an even worse fate.

721
00:54:26,373 --> 00:54:29,126
Could we discuss the restaurant?

722
00:54:29,173 --> 00:54:33,724
Yes, we can discuss whatever you like
or not discuss whatever you like.

723
00:54:34,373 --> 00:54:36,648
It's a lovely afternoon.

724
00:54:38,853 --> 00:54:42,528
- If I'm to continue running the Empire...
- Continue?

725
00:54:42,573 --> 00:54:45,770
Of course, you're going to continue.
That was our agreement.

726
00:54:45,813 --> 00:54:50,125
I've been running it faithfully
for over 25 years, Mrs Whiting,

727
00:54:50,173 --> 00:54:54,166
and I may be a slow learner,
but I have learned this much.

728
00:54:55,653 --> 00:54:58,008
There's no money in food.

729
00:54:58,053 --> 00:55:01,443
You know what's troubling you, dear boy?
It's not the restaurant.

730
00:55:01,493 --> 00:55:05,247
Here you are, about to be a bachelor again,

731
00:55:05,293 --> 00:55:09,002
and my daughter has returned to Empire Falls.

732
00:55:10,213 --> 00:55:13,410
My brother's weekend menus are a hit.

733
00:55:13,453 --> 00:55:15,808
Friday, Mexican. Saturday, Thai.

734
00:55:16,853 --> 00:55:18,650
If we could sell beer and wine...

735
00:55:21,373 --> 00:55:26,891
If your mother had had her way, you might've
found yourself at the altar with my daughter

736
00:55:26,933 --> 00:55:28,924
if you hadn't married when you did.

737
00:55:28,973 --> 00:55:31,692
I thought we were discussing
the state of the Grill.

738
00:55:31,733 --> 00:55:37,126
Frankly, I'm curious to see how
you manage things the second time around.

739
00:55:37,173 --> 00:55:38,526
Curious?

740
00:55:38,573 --> 00:55:43,408
Oh, please,
spare me that tone of moral superiority.

741
00:55:43,453 --> 00:55:47,924
That you do get from your mother.
It was her one tiresome trait.

742
00:55:51,653 --> 00:55:56,522
And what you really hate is the fact that
I know you better than you know yourself.

743
00:55:58,133 --> 00:55:59,930
Maybe I'll surprise you someday.

744
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:03,204
Well, possibly. But you haven't yet.

745
00:56:04,773 --> 00:56:06,764
Incidentally...

746
00:56:07,733 --> 00:56:09,724
did my daughter let on to you

747
00:56:09,773 --> 00:56:13,163
that her doctors now believe that she's well?

748
00:56:15,573 --> 00:56:16,801
Yeah.

749
00:56:25,493 --> 00:56:27,085
Miles!

750
00:56:32,253 --> 00:56:35,290
Before, when I was trying to answer the door

751
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:37,528
and you saw it was me,

752
00:56:37,573 --> 00:56:39,962
for a moment,

753
00:56:40,013 --> 00:56:43,085
it looked like you wanted to run away.

754
00:56:43,973 --> 00:56:49,525
No. It was a surprise, that's all.
A wonderful surprise.

755
00:56:51,093 --> 00:56:56,167
I can bear it that you don't love me, Miles.
I've borne it all my life.

756
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:59,285
But if I thought I made you want to run away...

757
00:57:04,693 --> 00:57:07,127
Have you got plans for homecoming?

758
00:57:08,853 --> 00:57:12,402
Empire Falls and Fairhaven,
weekend after next?

759
00:57:13,973 --> 00:57:15,770
You're inviting me to homecoming?

760
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,369
Yeah, why not?

761
00:57:22,373 --> 00:57:24,364
Oh, Miles!

762
00:57:26,573 --> 00:57:28,529
Dear, dear Miles.

763
00:57:31,253 --> 00:57:32,845
OK?

764
00:57:34,093 --> 00:57:36,084
- I'll call you.
- OK.

765
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,130
Come here!

766
00:58:04,133 --> 00:58:06,124
You gotta be kidding me.

767
00:58:20,813 --> 00:58:23,611
<i>Your mother, she was a sweet woman,</i>

768
00:58:23,653 --> 00:58:28,408
<i>but she was not blessed</i>
<i>with a sense of life's grand folly.</i>

769
00:58:31,093 --> 00:58:35,371
Miles, look, we're coming up on the island.
Isn't it exciting?

770
00:58:38,653 --> 00:58:42,726
You know, there'll be lots more
Little League games when you get back.

771
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,608
<i>And maybe we'll meet somebody nice.</i>

772
00:58:46,453 --> 00:58:50,162
- When's Dad coming?
- Maybe later in the week.

773
00:58:55,813 --> 00:58:57,804
Let's try to have fun, OK?

774
00:58:59,093 --> 00:59:01,084
Can we go to the beach?

775
00:59:01,133 --> 00:59:04,125
How about first thing? Yeah?

776
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:01,004
Mom, your lobster.

777
01:00:01,053 --> 01:00:04,045
- Look at my steamers.
- That looks nice.

778
01:00:34,293 --> 01:00:35,885
Pretty good.

779
01:01:05,373 --> 01:01:07,967
- Who's that?
- Who's who?

780
01:01:18,973 --> 01:01:22,443
I thought you said the dining room
was too expensive.

781
01:01:22,493 --> 01:01:27,362
- I think we can afford to splurge one night.
- Will they have steamers?

782
01:01:28,613 --> 01:01:30,729
How do I look?

783
01:01:47,013 --> 01:01:49,004
What? I don't see them.

784
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:55,168
I know. There's no steamers.
You have to order something else.

785
01:01:55,213 --> 01:01:57,408
Clams Casino.

786
01:01:59,093 --> 01:02:01,084
Yeah, Clams Casino.

787
01:02:02,173 --> 01:02:03,970
May I take your order?

788
01:02:04,013 --> 01:02:06,607
Clams Casino.

789
01:02:06,653 --> 01:02:09,645
Don't worry, if he doesn't like them, I do.

790
01:02:10,733 --> 01:02:13,042
I'll have the lobster.

791
01:02:13,093 --> 01:02:14,685
Thanks.

792
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:19,969
- Pardon me, but are you eating alone?
- Alas!

793
01:02:21,253 --> 01:02:23,050
Would you like to join us?

794
01:02:23,093 --> 01:02:25,482
I seem to have the larger table.

795
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:28,324
OK. Come on.

796
01:02:31,133 --> 01:02:34,443
- I haven't introduced myself. Charlie Mayne.
- We're from Maine.

797
01:02:34,493 --> 01:02:36,404
Really?

798
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:38,364
Well, now, that's interesting.

799
01:02:38,413 --> 01:02:42,201
M-A-Y-N-E is how I spell my name.
How do you spell your state?

800
01:02:42,253 --> 01:02:43,925
The real way.

801
01:02:47,213 --> 01:02:49,932
- And I'm Grace.
- Yes.

802
01:02:51,653 --> 01:02:53,803
Yes, you are.

803
01:03:00,133 --> 01:03:06,288
I think somebody needs to thank Charlie
for a wonderful and very expensive dinner.

804
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:10,042
Five orders of Clams Casino.
I bet that's a record.

805
01:03:13,213 --> 01:03:15,329
You know what?

806
01:03:15,373 --> 01:03:18,331
If we hurry, I think there's just time.

807
01:03:28,173 --> 01:03:30,562
Charlie, slow down!

808
01:03:30,613 --> 01:03:33,923
Faster! Faster!

809
01:03:54,453 --> 01:03:56,842
Oh, Charlie, look!

810
01:03:56,893 --> 01:03:58,884
What? Where?

811
01:04:03,253 --> 01:04:06,290
- Can I go walk on the beach?
- Sure.

812
01:04:14,693 --> 01:04:17,287
Take off your shoes, OK?
Don't get your pants wet.

813
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:18,732
OK.

814
01:04:20,213 --> 01:04:22,010
Thank you.

815
01:04:31,773 --> 01:04:34,162
- What are you trying to catch?
- Fish.

816
01:04:34,213 --> 01:04:36,044
Big ones.

817
01:04:59,213 --> 01:05:02,250
- Something wrong?
- No.

818
01:05:02,293 --> 01:05:05,091
Except how come every time I look up,
I see you?

819
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:09,770
- Small town, Miles.
- It's not that small.

820
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:14,127
Maybe. Maybe not.

821
01:05:38,897 --> 01:05:42,492
- Those napkins cost money, you know.
- I'll pay you for 'em.

822
01:05:43,297 --> 01:05:45,765
I want my new name to be second nature.

823
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:49,810
Goodbye, Janine Roby.
Hello, Janine Comeau.

824
01:05:50,897 --> 01:05:55,687
Did it ever occur to you
that I could use a hand with these boxes?

825
01:05:55,737 --> 01:05:59,525
After all these years,
you finally decided you don't like mule work?

826
01:05:59,577 --> 01:06:02,535
Give it up, Beatrice.
I'm not coming back to work for you.

827
01:06:02,577 --> 01:06:07,412
I got a job at one of the few successful
businesses in this whole sorry town.

828
01:06:07,457 --> 01:06:09,493
I lost 50 pounds.

829
01:06:09,537 --> 01:06:13,655
I feel good about myself
for the first time in my whole damn life

830
01:06:13,697 --> 01:06:17,849
and you're not gonna bring me down either,
so don't even try.

831
01:06:21,697 --> 01:06:23,494
Delicious.

832
01:06:25,457 --> 01:06:27,493
Good.

833
01:06:29,537 --> 01:06:32,335
And I am not trying to bring you down, little girl.

834
01:06:32,377 --> 01:06:37,167
It's a mother's duty to point out
when her child's acting dumber than usual.

835
01:06:37,217 --> 01:06:42,530
I mean,
trading in a perfectly good man like Miles

836
01:06:42,577 --> 01:06:46,172
for a strutting rooster like Walt Comeau

837
01:06:46,217 --> 01:06:48,447
simply defies imagination.

838
01:06:49,537 --> 01:06:53,212
Maybe one day I'll pack it all in like you,
but not today.

839
01:06:53,257 --> 01:06:56,294
People can change and I'm changing.

840
01:06:56,337 --> 01:07:00,125
You're not changing, Janine,
you're just losing weight.

841
01:07:00,737 --> 01:07:02,728
There's a difference.

842
01:07:02,777 --> 01:07:08,135
If you thought for two seconds about the effect
of all your foolishness on your daughter,

843
01:07:08,177 --> 01:07:10,372
that'd be a change.

844
01:07:13,417 --> 01:07:15,885
OK, John.

845
01:07:17,977 --> 01:07:19,968
Grab a seat.

846
01:07:22,057 --> 01:07:25,015
Christina, could I speak with you a minute?

847
01:07:29,977 --> 01:07:32,969
Christina, I need to ask you a favour.

848
01:07:34,457 --> 01:07:38,848
Recently there have been
some lunchroom incidents involving...and...

849
01:07:40,217 --> 01:07:45,086
Maybe if he could join you here in six,
since you take art together...

850
01:07:46,177 --> 01:07:51,012
There's a certain element in our school
that enjoys tormenting that...

851
01:07:51,777 --> 01:07:53,369
unhappy boy.

852
01:07:54,017 --> 01:07:57,134
His parents abandoned him
on his grandmother.

853
01:07:57,177 --> 01:07:59,975
He's missed an awful lot of school.

854
01:08:00,017 --> 01:08:03,976
What he needs is a friend.
I don't mean a girlfriend or anything.

855
01:08:04,017 --> 01:08:07,896
It would just be nice for him to know
that not everybody...

856
01:08:07,937 --> 01:08:09,529
Right.

857
01:08:23,857 --> 01:08:27,566
About time. Come on up.

858
01:08:27,617 --> 01:08:30,734
- That hasn't been scraped yet.
- So what?

859
01:08:30,777 --> 01:08:35,646
- What are you doing here, Dad?
- I'm painting! You owe me for two hours.

860
01:08:35,697 --> 01:08:39,406
- I don't owe you anything.
- What happened to your car seat?

861
01:08:39,457 --> 01:08:41,493
None of your business.

862
01:08:42,497 --> 01:08:45,091
Don't get mad at me. I didn't do it.

863
01:08:45,137 --> 01:08:47,048
I'm just an old man.

864
01:08:47,097 --> 01:08:49,486
- You have crumbs in your beard.
- So what?

865
01:08:53,577 --> 01:08:55,693
Peckerhead!

866
01:08:55,737 --> 01:08:59,047
- Tom?
- Where did this evil bastard come from?

867
01:08:59,097 --> 01:09:03,409
This is no evil bastard,
Tom, this is Miles Roby. You baptised him.

868
01:09:03,457 --> 01:09:06,927
- You married his parents...
- I know who it is!

869
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:09,127
Look at him, he's a filthy degenerate.

870
01:09:09,177 --> 01:09:12,772
If he's filthy, it's from painting
our church for free, remember?

871
01:09:12,817 --> 01:09:17,607
He's a peckerhead and his mother was
a whore and don't think I didn't tell her either!

872
01:09:17,657 --> 01:09:20,649
Tom, Tom! Look at me, look at me.

873
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:23,607
Remember what we talked about?

874
01:09:23,657 --> 01:09:28,777
I'm sorry you're not feeling well today
but this behaviour is intolerable.

875
01:09:28,817 --> 01:09:30,808
You owe Miles an apology.

876
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:37,889
Forgive me.

877
01:09:41,897 --> 01:09:43,694
<i>Mom, are you all right?</i>

878
01:09:45,657 --> 01:09:48,376
- Should I get Father Tom?
- No.

879
01:09:57,737 --> 01:10:02,128
- I'm sorry, Miles.
- I doubt he even remembers my mother.

880
01:10:02,177 --> 01:10:06,489
It's ironic that Tom's condition may be
the only thing keeping us open for business.

881
01:10:06,537 --> 01:10:08,732
Look at my father.

882
01:10:08,777 --> 01:10:13,771
- So how come you're dreaming of eggs?
- I'm not dreaming of eggs.

883
01:10:15,337 --> 01:10:19,330
But the assignment was to draw
our most vivid dream.

884
01:10:28,137 --> 01:10:31,334
So how come you're thinking of eggs?

885
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:40,495
It's something my mother once said to me
a long time ago.

886
01:10:42,697 --> 01:10:47,452
She said, "If chickens knew
what they were in for...

887
01:10:48,457 --> 01:10:50,448
"they'd stay in their eggs."

888
01:10:53,657 --> 01:10:55,852
She was frying eggs at the time.

889
01:11:06,537 --> 01:11:08,528
Is your mom dead?

890
01:11:11,497 --> 01:11:14,011
It's a possibility.

891
01:11:16,457 --> 01:11:21,451
Do we even want to know what those two
could possibly find to talk about?

892
01:11:22,897 --> 01:11:27,527
It's hard to imagine, all right.
A word to the wise.

893
01:11:27,577 --> 01:11:32,571
Don't let Max in unless you want to find your
valuables for sale at Empire Music and Pawn.

894
01:11:32,617 --> 01:11:37,293
- He'd steal from God?
- He's fearless, as far as God's concerned.

895
01:11:37,337 --> 01:11:42,286
I don't know if he's an atheist or he just thinks
he'll bullshit God like he does everybody else.

896
01:11:42,337 --> 01:11:44,805
Well, you give him this, anyway.

897
01:11:44,857 --> 01:11:47,246
Don't worry, it's not too much.

898
01:11:47,297 --> 01:11:50,334
Well, he'll be grateful. And it is too much.

899
01:11:50,377 --> 01:11:54,165
You know, actually, Father,
he won't be grateful.

900
01:11:54,217 --> 01:11:56,173
But he'll be glad to have it.

901
01:11:56,217 --> 01:12:01,416
Do you want my other half a sandwich?
Because I am full and I won't eat it.

902
01:12:10,217 --> 01:12:12,208
So this is your new boyfriend?

903
01:12:12,257 --> 01:12:16,375
- You're not supposed to be in here.
- I have a hall pass.

904
01:12:18,257 --> 01:12:20,452
Dickhead, get lost.

905
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:26,130
My old girlfriend is gonna tell me
why she doesn't like me any more.

906
01:12:30,657 --> 01:12:35,651
Billy Wolf sprained his ankle at practice.
I'm gonna be starting against Fairhaven.

907
01:12:35,697 --> 01:12:39,531
- Congratulations.
- The coach was gonna start me anyway.

908
01:12:39,577 --> 01:12:43,172
Thank you, though.
You gonna come to the game?

909
01:12:44,657 --> 01:12:47,376
Everyone's going.
They're gonna hang out afterwards.

910
01:12:47,417 --> 01:12:50,534
Candace is coming. You should come.

911
01:12:50,577 --> 01:12:53,137
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

912
01:12:54,457 --> 01:12:56,288
Maybe?

913
01:13:00,337 --> 01:13:03,056
I've changed a lot since last spring.

914
01:13:03,937 --> 01:13:09,728
It just makes me really angry when you...
you won't even give me a second chance.

915
01:13:13,697 --> 01:13:18,088
I got an idea. Why don't we bring
your new boyfriend along with us?

916
01:13:18,137 --> 01:13:20,332
- No, leave him alone.
- Dickhead!

917
01:13:20,817 --> 01:13:23,285
- Don't.
- Dickhead.

918
01:13:23,337 --> 01:13:25,771
You! Turn around, look at me!

919
01:13:26,737 --> 01:13:29,570
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

920
01:13:29,617 --> 01:13:33,326
- What's your name?
- His name is John. John Voss.

921
01:13:34,937 --> 01:13:37,167
John Voss.

922
01:13:37,857 --> 01:13:42,851
No hard feelings there, John Voss.
You want to hang with us after the game?

923
01:13:42,897 --> 01:13:47,413
- OK.
- Did you hear that? It's OK with John Voss.

924
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:50,210
If you leave him alone,
I'll go to the game, OK?

925
01:13:53,417 --> 01:13:58,445
Hey, dickhead. I mean, John Voss,
Tick's gonna come, too, all right?

926
01:14:01,617 --> 01:14:03,448
Cheap bastard!

927
01:14:05,937 --> 01:14:09,327
He's a sissy, you know, that young one.

928
01:14:10,217 --> 01:14:11,809
What?

929
01:14:12,777 --> 01:14:16,816
- You're just mad cos I got paid, you didn't.
- I'm thrilled that you got paid.

930
01:14:16,857 --> 01:14:21,647
Maybe you can make it to the end of the week
without hitting me up for a loan.

931
01:14:23,937 --> 01:14:27,407
- What are you doing?
- Glove box won't open.

932
01:14:27,457 --> 01:14:32,326
That's because it's locked.
People keep taking money out of it.

933
01:14:32,377 --> 01:14:35,414
That little lock wouldn't stop anybody.

934
01:14:43,697 --> 01:14:46,165
You're not gonna get this $20 bill.

935
01:14:47,937 --> 01:14:52,488
Boy, if I was you,
I'd start courting that cripple, Cindy Whiting.

936
01:14:53,417 --> 01:14:56,409
And you wonder
why I don't come to you for advice.

937
01:14:56,457 --> 01:15:00,973
If all I had to do to get my hands on $10 million
was to marry a cripple...

938
01:15:02,417 --> 01:15:05,215
- would I ever!
- Yeah, then you'd leave her.

939
01:15:06,417 --> 01:15:08,009
God.

940
01:15:09,937 --> 01:15:12,371
Give me a screwdriver,
I could fix that for you.

941
01:15:13,577 --> 01:15:16,774
If you'd marry that cripple,
you'd own the whole town.

942
01:15:16,817 --> 01:15:22,210
Tick could go to a good college
and there might just be enough left over

943
01:15:22,257 --> 01:15:24,452
so I could spend the winter in the Keys.

944
01:15:24,497 --> 01:15:27,091
- Could you not refer to her that way?
- What way?

945
01:15:27,137 --> 01:15:30,527
- As a cripple. Could you not do that?
- What way should I call her?

946
01:15:30,577 --> 01:15:34,172
Don't call her anything,
don't refer to her at all. How'd that be?

947
01:15:34,217 --> 01:15:37,687
A fellow down in the Keys
called himself a cripple all the time.

948
01:15:37,737 --> 01:15:40,934
- He said, "Max, don't ever be a cripple."
- Good God!

949
01:15:40,977 --> 01:15:44,413
- Well, don't get mad at me is all I'm saying.
- Give me a...

950
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:50,248
It wasn't me that run over her. If your mother
had told you to marry her, you'd marry her.

951
01:15:50,297 --> 01:15:52,333
We'd have 10 million bucks to split.

952
01:15:52,377 --> 01:15:55,972
If Mom was still alive,
she and I would have 10 million bucks.

953
01:15:56,017 --> 01:15:58,736
You would be shit out of luck, partner.

954
01:15:59,537 --> 01:16:02,927
Get along home, little Cindy

955
01:16:08,817 --> 01:16:12,571
- All right, all right, all right!
- I'll marry you one day

956
01:16:13,137 --> 01:16:17,733
Good Lord, that's quite a crowd.
Looks like you could use some help.

957
01:16:18,937 --> 01:16:21,531
I'm available if the money is right.

958
01:16:22,817 --> 01:16:25,615
- The cavalry has arrived!
- How you doing?

959
01:16:25,657 --> 01:16:28,854
Not bad for a one-armed man.
Charlene needs help.

960
01:16:28,897 --> 01:16:32,606
- Dad, put this on before you go out front.
- And wash your hands.

961
01:16:33,137 --> 01:16:37,176
- Wash my hands so I can bus dirty dishes?
- Just wash them.

962
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:39,367
Hi.

963
01:16:39,417 --> 01:16:41,408
Hey, who's this? Who are you?

964
01:16:41,457 --> 01:16:43,652
This is John from my art class.

965
01:16:43,697 --> 01:16:47,053
Uncle David said we needed a new busboy.
I showed him how.

966
01:16:47,097 --> 01:16:51,056
Take a look at Brian.
He's a walking appetite suppressant.

967
01:16:52,217 --> 01:16:54,811
Brian. Come here for a minute.

968
01:16:54,857 --> 01:16:57,974
- What?
- You gotta go home.

969
01:16:58,017 --> 01:17:01,373
What do you mean? I can't help it.
Something bit me. I can still work.

970
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:04,409
Yeah, but people eat here, Brian. Go home.

971
01:17:04,457 --> 01:17:06,925
Hello, John. Miles.

972
01:17:12,257 --> 01:17:15,055
- Hi, Grandpa!
- Tickeroo!

973
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:17,327
Hi.

974
01:17:17,377 --> 01:17:19,937
Your beard is scratchy, Grandpa.

975
01:17:20,457 --> 01:17:23,608
- And you smell.
- Well, so do you.

976
01:17:23,657 --> 01:17:26,808
Difference is you're young so you smell good.

977
01:17:26,857 --> 01:17:28,848
Here, just bus the dishes, Dad.

978
01:17:28,897 --> 01:17:32,287
You take any of Charlene's tips,
she'll gut you like a carp.

979
01:17:32,337 --> 01:17:35,727
Down in the Keys,
the waitresses split their tips with the busboys.

980
01:17:35,777 --> 01:17:38,769
Why don't you give that a try,
let me know how it turns out?

981
01:17:38,817 --> 01:17:42,207
Old man, you steal one dime of mine,
I will castrate you.

982
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:44,532
- I've already warned him.
- Castrate you.

983
01:17:51,017 --> 01:17:53,485
- Hey, Walt.
- Business is really picking up?

984
01:17:53,537 --> 01:17:54,936
It's great.

985
01:17:54,977 --> 01:17:58,174
- This upscale idea of yours is really good.
- Yeah, it is.

986
01:17:58,217 --> 01:18:02,529
I'm in the john and I'm thinking, "How can he
put even more money into the box,

987
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:04,568
"you know, add even more class?"

988
01:18:04,617 --> 01:18:08,405
- What did you come up with?
- You add an E on the end of "Grill".

989
01:18:10,257 --> 01:18:13,055
G-R-I-L-L-E.

990
01:18:13,097 --> 01:18:16,089
- Now, that is a great idea, Walt.
- Thanks.

991
01:18:25,377 --> 01:18:29,495
Why don't you just clean those two tables,
then you can join your friends.

992
01:18:29,537 --> 01:18:32,370
- Is that Candace out there?
- Yeah.

993
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:37,410
I thought you gave Zack Minty
his walking papers last spring.

994
01:18:37,457 --> 01:18:40,051
What's that mean?

995
01:18:40,097 --> 01:18:45,091
- I just know how much you hate him.
- I don't hate him. He's just a boy.

996
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:48,129
What I do hate
is you being afraid to tell me things.

997
01:18:48,177 --> 01:18:50,566
That's cos there's nothing to tell, OK?

998
01:18:50,617 --> 01:18:54,405
We're going out as a group.
It's not just me and Zack.

999
01:18:55,217 --> 01:18:58,971
Hey, John, can you give us a minute,
please?

1000
01:18:59,017 --> 01:19:00,609
Thanks.

1001
01:19:02,057 --> 01:19:05,254
What about Donny, the boy from the Vineyard?
I thought you two...

1002
01:19:05,297 --> 01:19:07,288
I haven't even gotten a letter.

1003
01:19:07,337 --> 01:19:11,046
It hasn't been that long and
be fair, you haven't written him either.

1004
01:19:11,097 --> 01:19:13,292
Well, we still don't have e-mail.

1005
01:19:16,697 --> 01:19:19,973
- Do you want me to let John off, too?
- No.

1006
01:19:26,937 --> 01:19:27,926
Where have you been?

1007
01:19:27,977 --> 01:19:30,172
Talking to Audrey,
the manager at The Lamplighter.

1008
01:19:30,217 --> 01:19:34,210
She said they were slow all evening.
So was The Eating House out on 92.

1009
01:19:34,257 --> 01:19:38,853
The only restaurant in Dexter County
that did any volume tonight was us.

1010
01:19:38,897 --> 01:19:40,888
I made great tips, too.

1011
01:19:40,937 --> 01:19:44,532
Selling fajitas to Mainers.
Who'd have thought you could make a living?

1012
01:19:44,577 --> 01:19:48,616
The Lamplighter may have done shit
but they still out-grossed us.

1013
01:19:48,657 --> 01:19:50,807
Because they sell booze.

1014
01:19:51,897 --> 01:19:53,376
Yeah.

1015
01:19:54,337 --> 01:20:00,128
Sure, we did good tonight. We'll never do
any better. We can't put any more tables in.

1016
01:20:00,177 --> 01:20:03,886
We can't put any more people
at the tables we already got.

1017
01:20:03,937 --> 01:20:08,215
- We killed ourselves tonight. For what?
- I know, I know.

1018
01:20:08,257 --> 01:20:10,976
Don't just say, "I know, I know," Miles.

1019
01:20:11,017 --> 01:20:14,612
What do you what from me, David?
I talked to Mrs Whiting.

1020
01:20:14,657 --> 01:20:19,094
- I showed her the books.
- No, I don't want to hear about Mrs Whiting!

1021
01:20:19,137 --> 01:20:24,336
Jesus Christ,
what a good Catholic boy you are, Miles!

1022
01:20:25,977 --> 01:20:30,767
Somebody tells you you can't have something,
you just genuflect and accept it.

1023
01:20:30,817 --> 01:20:33,854
Look at yourself, look! Have you seen this?

1024
01:20:33,897 --> 01:20:39,529
Every time you come back from that woman's
house, you've got scratch marks on you.

1025
01:20:39,577 --> 01:20:43,365
- Have you thought about what that means?
- She's got a psychotic cat.

1026
01:20:43,417 --> 01:20:46,727
No, it means she's toying with you, Miles.

1027
01:20:47,737 --> 01:20:53,448
She owns the whole town, yeah, yeah,
but she only owns you because you let her.

1028
01:21:06,137 --> 01:21:09,607
- $500,000.
- What?

1029
01:21:09,657 --> 01:21:13,855
What the bookstore on the Vineyard costs,
the one you want me to buy.

1030
01:21:13,897 --> 01:21:17,606
- Where will I come up with $500,000?
- Screw that, I'm talking about you.

1031
01:21:17,657 --> 01:21:21,047
Every time that you want something,
really want it,

1032
01:21:21,097 --> 01:21:24,885
you shove it away in some dark corner
so you don't have to think about it.

1033
01:21:24,937 --> 01:21:28,009
As if you're gonna be punished for wanting it.

1034
01:21:28,697 --> 01:21:31,734
Jesus, it breaks my heart!

1035
01:21:32,577 --> 01:21:36,013
And we both know where you got that from
and it's not Dad.

1036
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:38,525
You know what, Charlene?
This needs to be said.

1037
01:21:38,577 --> 01:21:43,412
Tell that woman to get us a liquor licence
or go fuck herself!

1038
01:21:43,457 --> 01:21:46,927
And if you don't wanna do it for yourself,
do it for Tick

1039
01:21:46,977 --> 01:21:51,289
because she's soaking up more
of your defeatism and passivity every day.

1040
01:21:51,337 --> 01:21:53,726
David, look at your brother.

1041
01:21:53,777 --> 01:21:58,692
Just be quiet for a minute and look at him.

1042
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:04,094
Aw, shit.

1043
01:22:05,697 --> 01:22:07,892
OK, I'm going home.

1044
01:22:12,857 --> 01:22:15,849
Sorry. I spoiled the party.

1045
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:18,365
- David, you don't have to go.
- No, I do.

1046
01:22:18,417 --> 01:22:21,568
It's time I got home
and tended to my pot empire.

1047
01:22:22,977 --> 01:22:25,172
That was a joke, Miles.

1048
01:22:25,217 --> 01:22:28,812
I've got one plant in the basement, Miles,
under a heat lamp.

1049
01:22:28,857 --> 01:22:31,451
- Whatever.
- Whatever's right.

1050
01:22:34,097 --> 01:22:37,089
I'd better go. I'll be right back.

1051
01:22:46,177 --> 01:22:48,168
- Miles.
- Hey, Bill.

1052
01:23:02,937 --> 01:23:06,566
Hey, he does care about you, you know.

1053
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:10,451
He just thinks you eat too much shit.

1054
01:23:12,057 --> 01:23:14,048
I take it you agree.

1055
01:23:14,897 --> 01:23:16,694
I don't know, Miles.

1056
01:23:16,737 --> 01:23:20,855
You've got to be the most cautious man
I've ever run across.

1057
01:23:20,897 --> 01:23:22,489
Yeah.

1058
01:23:22,537 --> 01:23:26,928
You know how when Max wants something,
how he's always got a plan?

1059
01:23:26,977 --> 01:23:30,367
No matter how hard you try,
you can't distract him.

1060
01:23:30,737 --> 01:23:34,127
David thinks you get distracted
by other people.

1061
01:23:46,417 --> 01:23:50,046
Yeah, well,
he doesn't even know the worst of it.

1062
01:23:50,617 --> 01:23:54,087
I invited Cindy Whiting
to homecoming tomorrow.

1063
01:23:54,137 --> 01:23:56,856
That's really sweet, Miles.

1064
01:23:56,897 --> 01:24:01,846
That woman could use a little joy in her life.
That is a really nice thing that you've done.

1065
01:24:01,897 --> 01:24:05,685
It was Cindy who nursed my mother
through the cancer right to the end.

1066
01:24:05,737 --> 01:24:09,571
Mrs Whiting took her in
but it was Cindy who took care of her.

1067
01:24:10,977 --> 01:24:14,765
I left school to be close by
but the truth is I never got out there much.

1068
01:24:14,817 --> 01:24:17,775
My mother was furious with me for quitting.

1069
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:21,128
I didn't know that.

1070
01:24:26,017 --> 01:24:31,614
Why do you think I crossed that river
every day for the last ten years?

1071
01:24:31,657 --> 01:24:36,685
So you could end up working
at the Empire Grill? Don't do this, Miles.

1072
01:24:36,737 --> 01:24:39,774
You go back to school, you graduate.

1073
01:24:39,817 --> 01:24:45,175
I'm going to graduate, Mom.
Just not this semester.

1074
01:24:45,217 --> 01:24:47,526
- For now, this is where I belong.
- No.

1075
01:24:47,577 --> 01:24:52,014
- As soon as you're better, I'll go back.
- I'm not going to get better. Don't pretend.

1076
01:24:52,057 --> 01:24:54,446
- Mom, look...
- No. Miles...

1077
01:24:54,497 --> 01:24:57,455
Mom, Mrs Whiting's making me a manager.

1078
01:24:57,497 --> 01:24:59,886
- Later...
- But you'll end up trapped here.

1079
01:24:59,937 --> 01:25:04,852
Can't you see, Miles?
She knows how much you love me.

1080
01:25:07,097 --> 01:25:09,486
Don't be kept from your life.

1081
01:25:11,297 --> 01:25:15,256
- Don't, for me. Not for me.
- Mom...

1082
01:25:20,857 --> 01:25:23,052
I guess you heard most of that.

1083
01:25:24,777 --> 01:25:26,210
Miles...

1084
01:25:27,297 --> 01:25:29,333
it's not your fault.

1085
01:25:30,097 --> 01:25:32,895
Thank you for taking care of her.
You have been so...

1086
01:25:32,937 --> 01:25:35,531
Don't be silly, Miles.

1087
01:25:35,577 --> 01:25:40,571
She's been a mother to me.
All those years she cared for me.

1088
01:25:44,737 --> 01:25:46,728
My only mother, really.

1089
01:25:48,697 --> 01:25:51,291
I'll go in. I can usually calm her down.

1090
01:25:55,457 --> 01:25:59,848
I went over there one night, near the end.

1091
01:26:02,497 --> 01:26:05,216
Cindy was coming out of my mother's room.

1092
01:26:07,097 --> 01:26:09,816
I don't know how we got started, but...

1093
01:26:10,937 --> 01:26:13,929
At first, it was just her kissing me...

1094
01:26:15,057 --> 01:26:17,048
and then I was kissing her, too.

1095
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:22,853
And then we were, you know,
grappling, groping.

1096
01:26:25,617 --> 01:26:29,451
We were half-undressed
and then my mother cried out.

1097
01:26:30,737 --> 01:26:33,456
And Cindy put herself together
and went back in.

1098
01:26:33,497 --> 01:26:37,092
I was supposed to stay there and wait for her,

1099
01:26:37,137 --> 01:26:42,165
but by the time she got my mother
settled again, I realised what I was doing

1100
01:26:42,217 --> 01:26:45,812
and I just got out of there.

1101
01:26:45,857 --> 01:26:47,449
I bolted.

1102
01:26:50,897 --> 01:26:54,936
For the longest time, I've imagined...

1103
01:26:54,977 --> 01:26:59,573
what her face must have looked like
when she discovered I was gone.

1104
01:27:06,617 --> 01:27:09,006
There's no need to repeat that story.

1105
01:27:13,897 --> 01:27:17,094
Get rid of a hangover. That's pretty good.

1106
01:27:26,977 --> 01:27:28,968
David's right about one thing.

1107
01:27:30,697 --> 01:27:33,495
I don't really go after what I want, do I?

1108
01:27:35,297 --> 01:27:37,208
Miles.

1109
01:27:37,257 --> 01:27:41,728
It's not like I don't know
you've had this crush on me, like, forever.

1110
01:27:43,777 --> 01:27:45,768
You know how fond I am of you.

1111
01:27:47,337 --> 01:27:49,646
You're about the sweetest man I know.

1112
01:27:51,257 --> 01:27:53,566
- Do you wanna know what?
- What?

1113
01:27:55,257 --> 01:27:59,614
I'd like to take you home
and make love with you.

1114
01:28:02,577 --> 01:28:04,169
Except I...

1115
01:28:05,177 --> 01:28:08,328
I couldn't stand how disappointed you'd be.

1116
01:28:08,377 --> 01:28:13,371
And you wouldn't be able to conceal it either.
Not with that face of yours.

1117
01:28:13,417 --> 01:28:17,888
Well, the next time you feel the impulse,
let me know.

1118
01:28:18,937 --> 01:28:21,405
I just might want to risk it.

1119
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:32,135
Hey, listen...

1120
01:28:32,177 --> 01:28:35,089
You did a good deed, hiring that Voss boy.

1121
01:28:35,137 --> 01:28:37,935
You know what they say. No good deed goes...

1122
01:28:37,977 --> 01:28:40,013
Unpunished.

1123
01:28:40,057 --> 01:28:44,653
He's had it pretty rough. His parents
were low-rent drug dealers in Portland.

1124
01:28:44,697 --> 01:28:47,495
When he was little,
they'd stuff him in a laundry bag

1125
01:28:47,537 --> 01:28:52,133
and hang him on the inside of a closet door
while they conducted business.

1126
01:28:52,177 --> 01:28:55,567
They didn't always come back for him
right away.

1127
01:28:55,617 --> 01:28:58,927
- Good night, Bea.
- So long.

1128
01:28:58,977 --> 01:29:02,049
That's awful. Did you hear that?

1129
01:29:05,057 --> 01:29:08,652
My dear brother has this notion
that you and I should go into business.

1130
01:29:08,697 --> 01:29:11,894
Well, I've heard dumber ideas.

1131
01:29:12,897 --> 01:29:15,286
It'dhave to be your call, Miles.

1132
01:29:18,777 --> 01:29:24,135
- I'm not quite sure I see how to make it work.
- Let me know if you change your mind.

1133
01:29:24,177 --> 01:29:27,487
You married my daughter so I owe you one.

1134
01:30:07,257 --> 01:30:09,976
I'm gonna hit the shower.

1135
01:30:10,017 --> 01:30:13,373
Oh, yeah? Well, I have a better idea.

1136
01:30:16,097 --> 01:30:17,689
Oh, God!

1137
01:30:17,737 --> 01:30:21,127
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1138
01:30:21,177 --> 01:30:23,133
Oh, God!

1139
01:30:23,177 --> 01:30:28,046
Oh, God! Miles never would have
found that spot. Oh, God!

1140
01:30:38,737 --> 01:30:41,729
- Have a good day, now.
- Thanks. You, too.

1141
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:52,086
Empire Grill.

1142
01:30:52,137 --> 01:30:54,128
Father Mark, hi.

1143
01:30:54,937 --> 01:30:56,734
Right now?

1144
01:30:56,777 --> 01:30:58,972
I'm running late, actually.

1145
01:30:59,017 --> 01:31:02,168
I can't figure out how he got it open.

1146
01:31:02,217 --> 01:31:06,608
He was always asking me for the combination
and getting mad when I wouldn't give it to him.

1147
01:31:06,657 --> 01:31:10,491
- How much was in there?
- Just a few hundred bucks, is all.

1148
01:31:10,537 --> 01:31:13,973
- And they took the parish station wagon.
- They?

1149
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:21,013
I found this on his bedside table.

1150
01:31:21,057 --> 01:31:23,207
Sunny Florida.

1151
01:31:23,257 --> 01:31:25,532
I don't believe it.

1152
01:31:27,457 --> 01:31:30,733
- Forgot my purse. Be right back.
- I'll miss you.

1153
01:31:47,577 --> 01:31:49,966
1943?

1154
01:32:04,017 --> 01:32:07,612
- Couldn't find seats further up?
- Hello, Janine.

1155
01:32:07,657 --> 01:32:10,888
- Put that on before you catch cold.
- I'm plenty warm, Beatrice.

1156
01:32:10,937 --> 01:32:14,646
Well, your nipples tell a different story.
Where's the Silver Fox?

1157
01:32:14,697 --> 01:32:18,531
Someplace he's not supposed to be,
that's where you'll find him.

1158
01:32:18,577 --> 01:32:20,374
Right, like your bedroom.

1159
01:32:24,057 --> 01:32:26,048
What in the world are you sitting on?

1160
01:32:26,097 --> 01:32:28,565
My haemorrhoid cushion.
Does it embarrass you?

1161
01:32:28,617 --> 01:32:31,814
No. I don't care if you show people
your actual haemorrhoids.

1162
01:32:31,857 --> 01:32:36,453
- What are you in such a foul mood about?
- I haven't decided whether to tell you or not.

1163
01:32:36,497 --> 01:32:40,285
Who is that woman with Miles?
Looks like the Whiting girl.

1164
01:32:43,097 --> 01:32:47,648
- What are they doing on the Fairhaven side?
- Well, there's no room here.

1165
01:32:48,617 --> 01:32:50,209
Serves you right.

1166
01:32:50,257 --> 01:32:54,045
You divorce that good man
and he turns around and marries millions

1167
01:32:54,097 --> 01:32:56,975
and you end up with Walt.

1168
01:32:57,017 --> 01:32:59,326
Beatrice, screw you.

1169
01:33:00,737 --> 01:33:05,288
Hey, there, Miss Whiting.
Hey, why don't you sit down right here?

1170
01:33:06,297 --> 01:33:09,607
These folks won't mind shoving down.
Come on.

1171
01:33:10,577 --> 01:33:12,374
Watch the reverse!

1172
01:33:12,417 --> 01:33:15,614
I saw that cute little girl of yours
across the way.

1173
01:33:16,697 --> 01:33:20,292
Her and my Zack might be getting
back together is what I'm hearing.

1174
01:33:20,337 --> 01:33:25,286
- Which one is Zack?
- Right there, number 56. He plays linebacker.

1175
01:33:25,337 --> 01:33:30,047
He's only a sophomore but, if he keeps on
like he's going, the colleges will be interested.

1176
01:33:30,097 --> 01:33:32,088
Scholarships and such.

1177
01:33:32,977 --> 01:33:37,812
But if I catch him eating steroids I'll bust him
as quick as I would a kid with a kilo of crack.

1178
01:33:37,857 --> 01:33:39,848
Is crack sold by the kilo?

1179
01:33:42,257 --> 01:33:45,647
However it's sold, zero tolerance
is what I'm saying. Get him!

1180
01:33:48,857 --> 01:33:50,848
Look, they're behind.

1181
01:33:52,857 --> 01:33:54,848
- I'll get it.
- Thanks.

1182
01:33:58,257 --> 01:34:00,248
Come on, defence!

1183
01:34:01,977 --> 01:34:06,414
They're only down by two touchdowns.
It's still the first quarter.

1184
01:34:17,697 --> 01:34:20,450
I'll go in. I can usually calm her down.

1185
01:34:26,537 --> 01:34:28,129
Miles?

1186
01:34:28,177 --> 01:34:30,372
Mrs Whiting, her thoughts are so...

1187
01:34:30,417 --> 01:34:33,170
It's the morphine talking, dear boy.

1188
01:34:34,177 --> 01:34:36,896
She's not thinking clearly.

1189
01:34:40,777 --> 01:34:46,647
She can't admit how much she needs you
here, how much of a comfort you are to her.

1190
01:34:46,697 --> 01:34:48,688
I don't think I am, actually.

1191
01:34:49,857 --> 01:34:54,647
Could you do that? Could you let her die,
knowing you just walked away?

1192
01:35:03,937 --> 01:35:07,327
You see?
This is why I never tell you anything, Beatrice.

1193
01:35:07,377 --> 01:35:11,529
I'm sorry, sweetie, I am,
but there is a kind of justice in this.

1194
01:35:11,577 --> 01:35:15,616
Really? Explain how me getting
fucked all over again is justice.

1195
01:35:15,657 --> 01:35:20,014
- How old did you think he was?
- Fifty is what he tells everybody.

1196
01:35:20,057 --> 01:35:22,890
"Look at me, I'm 50.
I got the body of a 40-year-old."

1197
01:35:22,937 --> 01:35:25,531
I've said from the beginning
you were trading down.

1198
01:35:25,577 --> 01:35:31,174
- "I've said from the beginning..."
- All right, then, make the best of it?

1199
01:35:31,217 --> 01:35:36,211
You're always going on about
how great the sex is. So what if he's 60?

1200
01:35:36,257 --> 01:35:40,250
Because, in ten years, by the time
I'm as old as he's pretending to be,

1201
01:35:40,297 --> 01:35:43,095
I'm gonna be humping an old man, Beatrice.

1202
01:35:43,137 --> 01:35:45,128
He needs help already.

1203
01:35:47,137 --> 01:35:50,846
He takes pills from this little container
with no label.

1204
01:35:52,377 --> 01:35:54,572
I think it's Viagra.

1205
01:35:59,417 --> 01:36:01,408
Oh, go ahead.

1206
01:36:06,257 --> 01:36:07,770
Come on, stop 'em!

1207
01:36:07,817 --> 01:36:12,129
Our defence is gonna be plumb tuckered out
by half-time!

1208
01:36:18,577 --> 01:36:21,375
Yeah! Did you see that hit?

1209
01:36:24,137 --> 01:36:26,128
Relax. Give him some air.

1210
01:36:26,177 --> 01:36:29,169
- Is he hurt?
- No, he just had his bell rung.

1211
01:36:29,217 --> 01:36:33,051
Actually, I think he is hurt. And the hit was late.

1212
01:36:33,097 --> 01:36:36,487
I know you went to college
but football's one thing I know...

1213
01:36:36,537 --> 01:36:42,134
Why don't you go set with the other experts
or are you too "plumb tuckered out" to move?

1214
01:36:47,937 --> 01:36:49,734
That boy is a class act.

1215
01:36:51,457 --> 01:36:54,051
Miles here don't agree, but...

1216
01:36:54,097 --> 01:36:58,693
For some reason, it embarrasses him
that we used to be friends, which is OK.

1217
01:36:58,737 --> 01:37:04,528
Except he seems to think his kid is too good
for mine and that I do mind. That I do mind.

1218
01:37:10,937 --> 01:37:15,727
That's what I'm talking about!
Who's the man? Yeah!

1219
01:37:15,777 --> 01:37:18,245
- Hi, Grandma.
- Hi there, Tickeroo.

1220
01:37:18,297 --> 01:37:21,607
- Where have you been hiding?
- With my friends.

1221
01:37:21,657 --> 01:37:24,125
My snake drawing got picked for the art show.

1222
01:37:24,177 --> 01:37:26,645
- I thought your teacher didn't like it.
- You drew a snake?

1223
01:37:26,697 --> 01:37:28,688
They brought in a judge from the college.

1224
01:37:28,737 --> 01:37:31,570
He and Mrs Rodrigue got into an argument
in the hall.

1225
01:37:31,617 --> 01:37:34,085
You caused all that ruckus
by drawing a snake?

1226
01:37:34,137 --> 01:37:37,607
My friend John, his got chosen, too.

1227
01:37:37,657 --> 01:37:40,854
- That made her even madder.
- Excuse me, don't I rate a hello?

1228
01:37:40,897 --> 01:37:44,287
Tell your mother to put her sweatshirt on.
Tell her she looks cold.

1229
01:37:44,337 --> 01:37:47,295
- You do look cold, Mom.
- I'm not cold.

1230
01:37:47,337 --> 01:37:51,296
The way that we cheered whenever
our team was scoring a touchdown!

1231
01:37:56,617 --> 01:37:58,414
OK.

1232
01:37:59,737 --> 01:38:02,126
- Look how terrific you look.
- Thank you.

1233
01:38:02,177 --> 01:38:06,967
But you know what, sweetheart, you should
put your sweatshirt on. You look cold.

1234
01:38:08,657 --> 01:38:10,249
Sweetie?

1235
01:38:16,297 --> 01:38:19,494
Prettiest place in Empire Falls, don't you think?

1236
01:38:19,537 --> 01:38:21,528
Sad but true.

1237
01:38:23,817 --> 01:38:29,289
- Someone put flowers on Mother's grave.
- I always leave flowers.

1238
01:38:29,337 --> 01:38:32,932
A bunch on Daddy's, another on Grace's.

1239
01:38:32,977 --> 01:38:34,968
To me she was like...

1240
01:38:37,457 --> 01:38:40,449
I didn't think I could bear it when she died.

1241
01:38:43,817 --> 01:38:47,605
- You never noticed before?
- I don't come here.

1242
01:38:50,137 --> 01:38:51,934
I should, but...

1243
01:38:54,977 --> 01:38:56,968
Tell me that wasn't Timmy.

1244
01:38:58,217 --> 01:39:00,014
Oh, Miles.

1245
01:39:01,017 --> 01:39:04,054
Mother won't visit Daddy's grave either.

1246
01:39:04,097 --> 01:39:06,895
I usually have to come alone.

1247
01:39:08,697 --> 01:39:12,656
Oh, look. I don't understand this.

1248
01:39:13,657 --> 01:39:16,694
I can't believe this. It always happens.

1249
01:39:16,737 --> 01:39:21,527
I put these here the same day
I did your mother's and they're dead.

1250
01:39:21,577 --> 01:39:24,375
It's as if his grave is cursed.

1251
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:28,615
No, I think a dog lifted its leg on them.

1252
01:39:42,657 --> 01:39:47,048
It was your mother who told me
it was OK to love him if I wanted to.

1253
01:39:48,297 --> 01:39:53,655
That what a woman feels deep in her heart
is her own business.

1254
01:39:58,937 --> 01:40:02,612
- Night-night, sweetie.
- Aren't you going to sleep?

1255
01:40:04,617 --> 01:40:07,927
I'm gonna read a little first, OK?

1256
01:40:09,697 --> 01:40:10,891
Mom?

1257
01:40:12,657 --> 01:40:14,568
Do you like Charlie?

1258
01:40:16,057 --> 01:40:19,527
I guess. Do you?

1259
01:40:19,577 --> 01:40:22,375
Do you like him better than Dad?

1260
01:40:23,457 --> 01:40:25,448
Because I like Dad better.

1261
01:40:27,777 --> 01:40:29,574
You know who I like most?

1262
01:40:30,577 --> 01:40:33,091
- Who?
- You.

1263
01:40:37,657 --> 01:40:40,376
I'm sorry I got my pants all wet.

1264
01:40:40,417 --> 01:40:42,135
I know, sweetie.

1265
01:40:42,177 --> 01:40:46,329
Sometimes things just happen,
whether you mean them to or not.

1266
01:40:46,377 --> 01:40:48,174
Night-night.

1267
01:41:54,697 --> 01:41:57,086
I'll be glad when this goes away.

1268
01:41:59,017 --> 01:42:00,814
What?

1269
01:42:00,857 --> 01:42:04,213
Today, at the beach, I want it to be just us.

1270
01:42:05,137 --> 01:42:08,447
That's too bad, honey,
cos I already invited Charlie to join us.

1271
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:12,126
- I'll tell Dad.
- You'll have to wait till he's out of jail.

1272
01:42:13,297 --> 01:42:19,088
He was arrested last week for being a public
nuisance, Miles, and not for the first time.

1273
01:42:20,097 --> 01:42:23,487
He becomes a public nuisance
when he tires of being a private one.

1274
01:42:23,537 --> 01:42:25,255
That's a lie.

1275
01:42:25,297 --> 01:42:29,495
No, it's the truth,
and you are old enough to know it.

1276
01:42:29,537 --> 01:42:34,930
I'll tell you something else, when we get home,
there are gonna be some changes.

1277
01:42:34,977 --> 01:42:37,650
So be prepared.

1278
01:42:51,057 --> 01:42:53,855
I checked with the restaurant this morning.

1279
01:42:54,857 --> 01:42:58,054
That five orders of Clams Casino is a record.

1280
01:43:03,177 --> 01:43:05,168
You mad at me?

1281
01:43:08,537 --> 01:43:10,528
Are you mad at your mom?

1282
01:43:12,737 --> 01:43:16,935
- She's an awfully nice person, you know.
- I know.

1283
01:43:17,937 --> 01:43:21,771
Everybody deserves a chance to be happy,
don't you think?

1284
01:43:21,817 --> 01:43:23,808
She is happy.

1285
01:43:25,857 --> 01:43:30,692
There comes a time in your life when you
realise that if you don't take the opportunity,

1286
01:43:30,737 --> 01:43:33,205
you won't ever get another.

1287
01:43:33,257 --> 01:43:35,248
She is happy.

1288
01:43:37,177 --> 01:43:39,566
Well, I guess I was talking about me.

1289
01:43:44,057 --> 01:43:45,854
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1290
01:43:48,337 --> 01:43:50,328
Tell me this isn't a dream.

1291
01:43:51,737 --> 01:43:54,126
Tell me I never have to wake up.

1292
01:44:16,097 --> 01:44:19,294
- You live here, dude?
- Leave him alone, Zack.

1293
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:22,612
Well, where's your car?

1294
01:44:23,177 --> 01:44:27,807
- Yeah, where is your car?
- We don't have one. My grandma...

1295
01:44:27,857 --> 01:44:31,736
Do you have indoor plumbing
or do you and your grandma shit in the woods?

1296
01:44:34,377 --> 01:44:38,814
You losing it? You losing it?
You losing it?

1297
01:44:38,857 --> 01:44:41,610
Stop it! Both of you, stop it!

1298
01:44:43,537 --> 01:44:45,812
No, I just had to get out.

1299
01:44:48,417 --> 01:44:51,489
- That's better.
- Sorry.

1300
01:44:58,857 --> 01:45:00,848
Night, dickhead!

1301
01:45:16,737 --> 01:45:19,456
Here, boy. Hey, buddy.

1302
01:45:24,577 --> 01:45:27,375
- Thanks. Thanks for everything.
- You're welcome.

1303
01:45:27,417 --> 01:45:30,409
- See you later.
- Yeah, have a nice evening.

1304
01:45:39,017 --> 01:45:42,214
You will tell me, won't you, dear boy?

1305
01:45:42,257 --> 01:45:44,213
Tell you what, Mrs Whiting?

1306
01:45:44,937 --> 01:45:48,134
When you get to the part
where you surprise me.

1307
01:46:05,657 --> 01:46:09,127
<i>How easy it is to get stalled in the shallows.</i>

1308
01:46:09,177 --> 01:46:14,649
<i>Life's tiny eddies swirling all around.</i>
<i>close to the shelter and safety of the shore.</i>

1309
01:46:14,697 --> 01:46:18,406
<i>And how hard to strike out</i>
<i>for the middle of the stream</i>

1310
01:46:18,457 --> 01:46:21,608
<i>where the stronger currents of destiny await</i>

1311
01:46:21,657 --> 01:46:23,966
<i>and where, who knows,</i>

1312
01:46:24,017 --> 01:46:27,612
<i>you might just surprise yourself.</i>

1313
01:46:28,937 --> 01:46:33,806
<i>Sometimes all it takes is being pushed</i>
<i>just a little too far.</i>
