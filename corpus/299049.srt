1
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,080
Please do not leave your car
unattended. It will be towed.

2
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,920
Straight to Prestridge, Miss Merteuil?

3
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,840
Please.

4
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,040
Please do not leave your car
unattended. It will be towed.

5
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,320
We're going to the same place.
Do you mind?

6
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,480
If we drive together,
we'll arrive together.

7
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,680
Yo, taxi.

8
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,040
- So nice to see you.
- Oh, I missed you so much.

9
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Look, I really don't understand why my
request for a single wasn't approved.

10
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,840
- Your name again?
- Patrick Bates. I'm a transfer student.

11
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,680
Bates. Right. Welcome to Prestridge.

12
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,680
- You have a condition of some sort.
- I've caught a cough.

13
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,040
Well, you heard what they said.
You're in a one-room double.

14
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,240
A moment of silence for his roommate.

15
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,480
Isn't there someone else I can talk to?
Can I talk to your supervisor?

16
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,840
Follow me.

17
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,200
Excuse me.

18
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,240
Excused.

19
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,600
You're evil, Cass.

20
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,400
- Took you how long to figure this out?
- We met in this very line last year.

21
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,920
This year they let me reserve a room.

22
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,400
Daddy bought a wing.

23
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,680
- Miss Merteuil, your suite is ready.
- Wonderful.

24
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,240
How was your summer?

25
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,000
Short. See you tonight.

26
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,480
Need to get a driver.

27
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,800
Hi.

28
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,560
Patrick, right?

29
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,600
I saw you checking out that girl in line.

30
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,960
What do you mean?

31
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,000
Cassidy Merteuil. Forget her.
She's a black widow.

32
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,920
Comes from a long line
of black widows.

33
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,800
You wouldn't last five minutes.

34
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,480
Let me guess,
you've never lasted five minutes.

35
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,440
I'm kidding, man.

36
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,760
Just leave Cassidy to me, all right?

37
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,400
If you're gonna cough,
can you take that outside?

38
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,600
I'm sorry, I can't help it,
but I shouldn't bother you at night...

39
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,440
...because I have sleeping pills.

40
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
That's a relief.

41
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,240
How do I look?

42
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,600
Seriously.

43
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,840
Not as good as...

44
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,560
- Christopher "Limey"?
- I prefer "Englishman."

45
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,120
He descended
from the House of Lancaster.

46
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,320
Yeah, so did his teeth.

47
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,200
Why fuck with guys like him when you
could be fucking with guys like me?

48
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,840
Because guys like you
don't dine with the queen.

49
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,840
Dream on.
I'm sure he prefers a real princess.

50
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,400
We'll see.

51
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,240
You know, you're just like your cousin.

52
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,160
She ruins the family name...

53
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,400
...forces you to California
to flee her rep, and yet...

54
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,800
...she's still your role model.

55
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,600
If you want to be Kathryn that badly,
at least let me be your Sebastian.

56
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,040
Kathryn. Sebastian.
Where are they now?

57
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,320
Oh, yeah, methadone clinic and dead.

58
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,320
We can do better.

59
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,160
Jason, the real reason
I've never slept with you:

60
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,960
You're no challenge whatsoever.

61
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,760
Not to mention a little deficient
when it comes to...

62
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,520
What?

63
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,880
The sexiest organ of all.

64
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,720
You know, the bigger the better.

65
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,400
The brain.

66
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,520
- this school.

67
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,160
If you don't look good,
we don't look good.

68
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,160
- We?
- A girl can hope.

69
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,800
- Yeah.
- Excuse us.

70
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,520
Sorry.

71
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,520
Jesus Christ, people...

72
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,120
...pop a Prozac or three.
Summer's finished. Get over it.

73
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,160
Saint-Tropez.

74
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,120
Hunting in Scotland.

75
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,560
Summer session at La Sorbonne.

76
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,040
Miami Beach.

77
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,960
Miami Beach? New money.

78
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,880
None of those are any more of a
playground than our Santa Barbara.

79
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,960
I speak for myself and my girlfriend...

80
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
...when I say we never
came here to play.

81
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Except for maybe with each other.

82
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,520
Didn't Cassidy
turn you on to this place?

83
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,560
She must have warned you
about guys like me.

84
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,280
By name, actually.

85
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,040
So Michael and Sheila
have come for the right reasons.

86
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,320
- How about you, Alison?
- I came for the education.

87
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,120
- Seriously.
- Christopher?

88
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,120
This is America. You hear the rumors,
but I am here in spite of them.

89
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,960
Patrick.

90
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,440
Now, here is a guy
that came to play. Patrick?

91
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,640
Sorry?

92
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,520
Think he'll make the cover
of the Prestridge catalog?

93
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,160
Now, that's the Cassie I know.

94
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Right. Well, I should probably be off.

95
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,000
You'll be around later?

96
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,160
Perhaps.

97
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,200
I'll hunt you down.

98
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,400
- I have something to show you.
- Oh, my gosh, let's see.

99
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,600
So Christopher has taken
an interest in me.

100
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,520
So Christopher has taken
an interest in me.

101
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,640
He should take an interest in flossing.

102
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,480
Quit it. He's royalty.

103
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,720
My father always stressed the value
of good foreign relations.

104
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,080
- I'm surprised it's taken you this long.
- I'm playing it cool.

105
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,200
I want to meet an entire new society.

106
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,880
- I wonder, is it possible?
- What?

107
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,800
That you've overestimated yourself.

108
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,160
Right.

109
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,600
I'll bet you $5000...

110
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,800
...you can't sleep with Christopher
by the end of this weekend.

111
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,720
Five thousand dollars wouldn't even
cover a weekend at the spa.

112
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,280
Fine. Ten thousand dollars.

113
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,200
Done.

114
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,320
- Doesn't seem fair, though.
- Why?

115
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,040
I would have bet on someone
easier than Christopher.

116
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,720
Really?

117
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,920
I'm not so sure that you could even
sleep with someone like Patrick...

118
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,680
...by the end of this weekend.

119
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,080
Patrick.

120
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,280
I could have Patrick in an hour, freak.

121
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,920
I'll tell you what: Another $ 10,000
says that you can't.

122
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,560
And because I'm a gentleman...

123
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,960
...gonna give you 48 hours
instead of one.

124
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,280
Forty-eight.

125
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,280
It's enough time to get rid
of that not-so-fresh feeling.

126
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,760
Nice.

127
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,440
I'll need some physical proof.

128
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,120
So let's see, that gives me 47 hours...

129
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,760
...for my disgust for you...

130
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,080
...to overcome my disgust for Patrick.

131
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,680
Have a nice time.

132
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,840
Here, try another one.

133
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,880
Let's see.

134
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,440
All right.

135
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,640
Alison, never forget the key
to a cultured man's heart.

136
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,920
Golf.

137
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,040
- Golf and blowjobs.
- Jason.

138
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,440
And you've been working
on your etiquette.

139
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,200
- I want a kiss.
- No.

140
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,280
Meaning no.

141
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,200
One?

142
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,000
Finished?

143
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,160
- Yeah.
- Good.

144
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,160
Now, never touch me again. Ever.

145
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,000
Friends?

146
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,200
Women.

147
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Is this taken?

148
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,720
No.

149
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,600
It's beautiful out.

150
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,040
Yeah.

151
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,640
Patrick, can I be honest?

152
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,720
- Sure.
- You interest me.

153
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,480
- I'm sorry?
- You interest me.

154
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,040
I interest you?

155
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,840
Sounds funny even to me, but yeah.

156
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,840
Thanks.

157
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,040
You see them?

158
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,320
I didn't think there'd come a time
when guys like that didn't interest me.

159
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,320
But I was wrong. Lately...

160
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,200
...l've been thinking
about guys like you.

161
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,280
Can I show you something?

162
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,600
Sure. Sure.

163
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,200
- Nice room.
- Thanks.

164
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,240
You're gonna be surprised...

165
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,280
...but I've been writing.

166
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,240
- What is it?
- A short story.

167
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,280
You're the first person I've shown it to.

168
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,480
You're an English major,
so I respect your opinion.

169
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,840
Would you look at it?

170
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,080
You want my feedback?

171
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,560
- I'm gonna go read it.
- I'll be right here.

172
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,640
How can you be so insecure?

173
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,160
How can you be so insecure?

174
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,640
I love it.

175
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,040
I'm blown away.

176
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,480
The writing and the dialogue...

177
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,400
Oh, I'm so excited.

178
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,320
I'll get it.

179
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,960
Cassidy.

180
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,800
Please.

181
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,400
I don't understand.

182
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
- What is it?
- Nothing, Patrick.

183
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,200
What is it?

184
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,280
- Oh, Jesus, you turn me on.
- Oh, my God.

185
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,960
- What? What? What is it?
- Nothing, Patrick.

186
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,360
Oh, God.

187
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,880
Jesus, you turn me...

188
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,560
Ten thousand dollars.

189
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,320
You could've faked that.

190
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,320
The orgasm? Of course.

191
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,520
- No, the tape.
- Please.

192
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,480
Sad, you could've used this
to make a little life for yourself.

193
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,520
You know you're only halfway home.

194
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,960
Christopher's coming over later.
I'll be home by midnight.

195
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,440
I'll be in touch.

196
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,040
So the key to a good polo pony
is one that is small and agile.

197
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,160
Fifteen hands is quite perfect.

198
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,360
Really? That's...

199
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,480
...fascinating.
- Yeah.

200
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,360
The ponies I had at Eton
were between 15 and 16 hands...

201
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,160
...and we never lost a match.
- Eton?

202
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,480
- So you know Prince William.
- Yeah, Wills was in my house with me.

203
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,000
He's an excellent player, you know.

204
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,400
Do you know him?

205
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,120
We've only met a few times,
mostly at charity functions.

206
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,920
You know, I think his grandmama
makes him go to those.

207
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,320
Yes, we both love to give money away.

208
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,120
I'm so glad you're here, Christopher.

209
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,280
I'm not used to young ladies
being quite so forward.

210
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,680
I'm not complaining.

211
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,160
I'm sure it's no one.

212
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,680
So are you liking the States?

213
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,600
Excuse me.

214
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,800
Hi. I brought you some...

215
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,320
What's going on?

216
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,160
Excuse me?

217
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,080
What does it look like? A date.

218
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,840
- Forgive me... Patrick, is it?
- What?

219
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,360
I barely know you.
What are you doing in my room?

220
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,800
What's wrong with you?

221
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,400
What's wrong with me?

222
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,320
I have spoken two words
to you in my entire life.

223
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,080
What?

224
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,760
This must be some sort
of mistake, Christopher.

225
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,840
Yes, evidently.

226
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,160
- Cassidy.
- I'd like you to leave.

227
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,600
Christopher, I don't know
why you're here...

228
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,360
...or what Cassidy has told you...

229
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,880
...but Cassidy and I just made love
a few hours ago.

230
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,040
- Well, I should probably go.
- No.

231
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,120
Not until you've had a chance
to judge her for yourself.

232
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,840
- To judge her?
- Look...

233
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,880
...it's Cassidy's purse.
You've seen her wearing it.

234
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,800
Open it and look for a tape recorder
and Cassidy's wallet.

235
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,320
I'm not going to investigate her.

236
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,400
What do you know?

237
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,480
I think Christopher
will be interested in this.

238
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,840
Good God!

239
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,760
Look, it's the $ 10,000 that Cassidy
took to do what you just heard.

240
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,600
This is extraordinary.

241
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,960
- Christopher, I can explain.
- Not the time.

242
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,480
So how does it feel to be used?

243
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,400
- You know better than anyone.
- So we're even.

244
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,520
- Well, we're even all right.
- Gosh, you're a disgusting little shit.

245
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,080
Well, well, well.

246
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,160
What's wrong with you?

247
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,000
Look at you with your tight ass
and your perfect little tits.

248
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
You still don't get it, do you?

249
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,000
Get what?

250
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,120
You wouldn't give a guy like me
the fucking time of day.

251
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,360
But you sure gave it to me
this afternoon.

252
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,560
- Jason told you to do this.
- No, Jason didn't tell me to do this.

253
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,480
I told Jason to do this.

254
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,840
What?

255
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,240
It looks like you lost your bet
on Christopher.

256
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,120
He sure isn't sleeping with you now,
but you know what?

257
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,920
Don't give Jason the money,
give it to me.

258
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,840
It wasn't Jason's money to begin with,
it was mine.

259
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,280
Okay, I'll slow down.

260
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,960
I arranged the whole thing.

261
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,000
The nerd act, the challenge,
the two bets.

262
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,320
The bet on me gave me
the chance to bang you.

263
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,480
The bet on Christopher gave me
the chance to win $ 10,000 back.

264
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,120
All I needed was a partner.

265
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,280
Someone who knows
what it's like to feel rejected.

266
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,640
Hey, toots.

267
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,240
You fuckers.

268
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Honestly, from experience,
I'm not sure you're worth $ 10,000...

269
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
...but you're a hell of a freebie.

270
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,560
I should've known
you couldn't afford that.

271
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,240
So, what did you get out of this?

272
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,560
One look at the expression
on your face.

273
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,760
You believe I found someone
as awful as you? I mean, come on...

274
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,000
...what are the chances?

275
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,880
Oh, by the way, your story...

276
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,800
...it sucked.

277
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,960
You know, it occurred to me, we go to
a school where they actually play polo.

278
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,320
Fucking sick.

279
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,160
Do you think we hurt her?

280
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,640
Who's ever had sex
where someone didn't get hurt?

281
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,760
You're bitter. I remember
lots of times when no one got hurt.

282
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,960
Sex is about hurting people.

283
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,240
You know, I never did ask:

284
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,320
Where'd you get the nerd act?

285
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,880
Well, I spent a long time
trying to hide the homely.

286
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,840
And then I realized,
don't conceal it, play it up.

287
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,720
Don't make it better, make it worse.

288
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,720
- They never see me coming.
- Yeah, well...

289
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,800
...l'm too proud to play a nerd.

290
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,480
Well, you've seen the last of the nerd.

291
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,240
So, what's next?

292
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,040
We'll see.

293
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,000
I want to take you home.

294
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,200
I said, I want to take you home.

295
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,960
I like a guy with goals.

296
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,880
- Michael, we came to look at the art.
- I am looking at art.

297
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,680
There's something about art.

298
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,840
I find it...

299
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,200
...inspirational...

300
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,560
...erotic...

301
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,080
Baby.

302
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,680
Hey, Alison, want a drink?

303
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,040
- I have a fiancé back home.
- One drink is hardly an infidelity.

304
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,400
I'm a gentleman.

305
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,440
I don't know.

306
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,240
Come on, the bartender
makes a killer martini.

307
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,320
All right.

308
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,400
Okay, what do you want,
vodka or gin?

309
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,320
- Vodka or gin?
- Oh, vodka.

310
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,680
Two vodka martinis, please.

311
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,760
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

312
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,400
Do you have a favorite painting?

313
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,640
- I like this one over here.
- Yeah?

314
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,840
- Has a little bit of a Basquiat feeling.
- Yeah, yeah.

315
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,920
You look really pretty.

316
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,400
You know, I should really get back
to my friend, but thank you so much.

317
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,840
Okay.

318
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,040
- He's kind of cute.
- You know, I'm kind of engaged.

319
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,080
But what about you?

320
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,240
There, you took me home.

321
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,920
Talk soon.

322
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,840
20-16. Soccer service.

323
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,440
Game!

324
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,560
- You're dead.
- Oh, what? What?

325
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,280
What? What?

326
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,440
Sorry.

327
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,560
Next game, you're mine.

328
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,360
Bring it on.

329
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,600
- lf I didn't know better...
- Alison?

330
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,320
- Never.
- Good.

331
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,920
She's engaged, since the age of 2...

332
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,840
...at least in the eyes of her family
and his. It's part of a larger merger.

333
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,720
Old money.

334
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,000
I have a question.

335
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,400
Does sex always satisfy you?

336
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,920
What do you mean?

337
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,680
I can't remember the last time
I was satisfied by sex.

338
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,160
- Is something wrong?
- You bored?

339
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,720
- I guess so.
- Nothing's wrong.

340
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,600
I get bored by sex too, if I don't use it.

341
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,040
- As what?
- A weapon.

342
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,800
Sick motherfucker.

343
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,760
How you feeling?

344
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,880
Strangely attracted to you.

345
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,600
- Bad boys and all.
- Nice.

346
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,840
I learned my lesson,
but you're done fucking with me.

347
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,120
I told you I loved her.

348
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,080
- You two are plotting something.
- What about it?

349
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,720
- I came to tell you it's pathetic.
- Why?

350
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,840
If you had me, you could have anyone.
Where's the challenge?

351
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,080
You're forgetting I haven't had you yet.

352
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,280
No, you're giving us too much credit.

353
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,520
There's no limit to what two people
can do. You taught me that.

354
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,360
But it's too easy.

355
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,720
So why don't you quit cooperating
and start competing...

356
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,960
...for some eligible bachelorettes.

357
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,680
It's only fair. After all, I can't stand
to see you two look bored.

358
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,560
She's right, you know.

359
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,680
- I have had my eye on her.
- Cassidy?

360
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,600
I do love her, but no. Sheila.

361
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,640
- She's devoted to...
- Michael.

362
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,600
I hadn't noticed.

363
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,320
Someone that sexy has no right
to be faithful to such an idiot.

364
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,320
- Or to anyone.
- I don't know if I'd pick Sheila, though.

365
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,040
Why not?

366
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,080
- I like Alison.
- You said you'd leave...

367
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,320
Until you're married,
you're not married.

368
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,280
Besides, Alison's perfect.
Virtuous and loyal.

369
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,240
She'd gasp at all the right moments.

370
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,080
Fine.

371
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,240
I steal Sheila from Michael,
you steal Alison from her fiancé.

372
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,000
First one to cross home plate wins
our dorm room.

373
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,560
- The loser?
- Fends for himself.

374
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,800
I could use some privacy.

375
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,720
- I'm gonna get started.
- Happy hunting.

376
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,400
I got next.

377
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,400
You got next?

378
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,320
This is some fundraiser
you helped organize.

379
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,040
Thanks. I think the pier's preservation
is really important.

380
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,160
- Oh, sorry.
- I got it.

381
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,720
- I'm a total klutz.
- That's okay. Here.

382
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,800
I saw that.

383
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,880
- What?
- Patrick.

384
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,760
- It's nothing.
- It's sweet.

385
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,000
My parents have always
been really supportive of me.

386
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,840
We have a great relationship.

387
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,880
I had trouble getting my folks
to pay attention.

388
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,520
So are you ready to watch
the master at work?

389
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,200
What was that?

390
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,280
Nothing. Let's go for a walk.

391
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,040
Hey, what's up? How you doing?

392
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,000
You gonna be at the game
on Saturday?

393
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,080
- Yeah, of course.
- See you there, buddy. Take care.

394
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,560
- Yeah. Yeah, I agree.
- He's a great guy.

395
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,800
Awesome polo player.

396
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,480
Okay, what's wrong?

397
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,480
Oh, just thinking of David.

398
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,000
What?

399
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,320
There's nothing wrong
with missing sex.

400
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,320
Alison, it's completely natural.

401
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,480
Okay, I do miss sex,
but that's not the point.

402
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,440
You know, I miss David.

403
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,920
We've known each other
since preschool.

404
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,600
How romantic. The blankets,
the blocks, the cookies and milk.

405
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,200
You know what I mean.

406
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,000
It's just sometimes you
sound more like brother and sister.

407
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:27,320
Yeah, well, we care about
each other very much.

408
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,320
I know.

409
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,760
These shots are of the altarpiece...

410
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,120
...from Mission San Carlos
Borroméo de Carmelo.

411
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,320
Look at the detail.

412
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,480
Absolutely exquisite.
Well, that's it for today.

413
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,640
The department field trip to Carmel
is a go for this weekend.

414
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,120
I checked the sign-up sheet.
We've full capacity.

415
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,120
Those of you attending will receive
extra credit upon your return.

416
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,520
I'll have somebody take my place.

417
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,280
I'm sorry, Professor Eldridge...

418
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,280
...the Carmel trip is full?
- Yes.

419
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,960
I was wondering if you'd
make an exception.

420
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,600
I normally wouldn't ask, but I started
my paper on Junípero Serra...

421
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,440
...and I was wondering...
- Jason...

422
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,720
...you should've thought
about this earlier.

423
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,840
Take it up with someone else
on the list.

424
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,480
- Yeah, I know...
- lf there are any cancellations...

425
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,360
...l'll let you know.

426
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,880
Yeah.

427
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,880
Weak.

428
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,840
Really?

429
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,280
Sheila and Michael
are such a cute couple...

430
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,520
...and you,
trying to come between them.

431
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,160
- You're just jealous.
- Jealous?

432
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,640
Sheila's going to love my big,
bulging brain.

433
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,560
Let's see it then.

434
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,920
Fucking hate California.

435
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,320
- Jason, what is it?
- What's wrong?

436
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,320
I was supposed to go visit my
grandmother near Carmel...

437
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,640
...but I missed the sign-up
for Eldridge's trip.

438
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,080
Why don't you fly?

439
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,800
Kind of on a tight budget.

440
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,200
Mamaw, she just had
both hips replaced.

441
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,560
She could use some cheering up,
but Eldridge is being a hard-ass.

442
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,880
- Sheila and I signed up for that trip.
- Yeah?

443
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,680
Yeah, she's dragging me.

444
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,400
- Says I could use a little culture.
- A little culture never killed anyone.

445
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,240
Hey, would you guys
be willing to visit her for me?

446
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,280
I have some things you could give her.

447
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,200
Sure, yeah, but I got a better idea.

448
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,960
Why don't you just take my place
on the trip?

449
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,640
Michael, you and Sheila planned this.

450
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,360
Really, we're mature enough
to spend a weekend apart.

451
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,960
You sure? You've been
looking forward to this trip.

452
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,320
I was only going to Carmel
to be with you.

453
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,280
Why don't we give Jason
a chance to see his grandmother?

454
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,280
Wow, I'm speechless,
but I wouldn't even consider it...

455
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,520
...unless it's okay with Sheila.

456
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,640
Sure.

457
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,440
You guys are saints, really.
I mean, I can just see her face now.

458
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,760
- It's the least we can do.
- Thanks, you guys.

459
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,640
- Careful I don't try and steal her.
- Yeah.

460
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,600
Come on, we'll go tell Eldridge.

461
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,840
"Mamaw"?

462
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,160
You never wanted to fuck me more
than right now.

463
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,160
It'll pass.

464
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,880
Come in.

465
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,040
What's wrong?

466
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,080
Alison...

467
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,440
...I love you.

468
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,280
- What?
- I love you.

469
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,480
- Please say something.
- I can't believe you just said that.

470
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,600
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

471
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,080
I don't know what to say.

472
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,320
David, your fiancé,
are you in love with him?

473
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,400
We're engaged.

474
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,080
But are you in love with him?
Because if you aren't...

475
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,320
I can't talk to you when you're like this.

476
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,720
No, not until you can
talk to me rationally.

477
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,760
I am rational, I promise...

478
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,080
...so let me say my piece. Please?

479
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,760
I love you.

480
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,120
And I think you might love me.

481
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,520
I'd never ask you to compromise your
relationship for a one-night stand.

482
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,800
Don't mistake any of the feelings
that I've shown you for love.

483
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,920
We're friends.

484
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,680
Just because the person I love...

485
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,280
...isn't here now doesn't mean
you can take advantage.

486
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,600
- You're not in love with David.
- Stop it.

487
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,600
Don't tell me who I'm in love with.

488
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,520
But you're spending four years apart.
If you're in love, you'd never do that.

489
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,000
Just because you can't imagine
a relationship...

490
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,400
...that's based on maturity and trust...
- Maturity and trust?

491
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,440
You sound like a bank.

492
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,040
If you felt any love for David,
any passion, you wouldn't be here.

493
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,120
- You're wrong.
- I'm right.

494
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,720
- I want you to go.
- Alison...

495
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,280
Go!

496
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,440
- How's it going?
- Right on schedule.

497
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,280
Yeah? Well, I'm ahead of schedule.

498
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,440
- Where are you going?
- Carmel.

499
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,000
With Michael and Sheila?

500
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,160
Nope. Just Sheila.

501
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,600
What? You look surprised.

502
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,160
No.

503
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,920
Look, is it really that crazy that
I'm better at this than you are?

504
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,120
No, he just said, "I love you"
out of nowhere.

505
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,480
- God, what was he thinking?
- I know.

506
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,640
You're practically married.

507
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,120
It's so important to our family and
the two businesses. It's like a legacy.

508
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,720
I mean, David and I have been meant
for each other since...

509
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,200
...forever.

510
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,880
You sound disappointed by that.

511
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,520
When I first brought up going to
school out here to David...

512
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,880
...you know what he said?

513
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,640
"Go."

514
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,120
And I wanted him to say that,
but then when he did, I just...

515
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:05,040
I got this weird feeling, and I found
myself wishing that he'd said...

516
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,720
"No."

517
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,440
It's awful, isn't it?

518
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,480
I mean, he's so great about it...

519
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,640
...but I just found myself wishing
that he'd be protective...

520
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,200
...love me too much to let me go.

521
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,960
And he didn't...

522
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,600
...and it made me wonder.

523
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,480
- Now I don't know.
- What about Patrick?

524
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,160
Patrick? I care about Patrick,
I'm just... I'm not attracted to him.

525
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,400
I understand.

526
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,720
Even if I were, it's just like... It's like
I'm waiting for something or someone.

527
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,880
It all sounds terrible, doesn't it?

528
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,280
No, not at all.

529
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,400
One sec.

530
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,720
I probably shouldn't tell you this,
but you're closer than you think.

531
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,720
- Excuse me?
- That fiancé of Alison's isn't a lock.

532
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,000
- Really?
- Don't lube up yet.

533
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,400
She wants to trade up, not down.

534
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,800
Maybe if you looked more like...

535
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,960
...Brent.

536
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,480
Let's see, what were her exact words?
Oh, yeah. "Patrick? I care about him...

537
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,400
...l'm just...
I'm just not attracted to him."

538
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,320
What, doesn't seem fair?

539
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,360
Life's not fair.

540
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,600
Hi. I came to say I'm sorry.

541
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,080
It wasn't until now that I realized what
your friendship means to me, and...

542
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,440
- What's that?
- The world.

543
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,240
I respect your relationship
with David. I do.

544
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,960
If all I can have is your
friendship, that's fine.

545
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,000
Just please don't shut me out.

546
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,760
So you're okay with just being friends?

547
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,040
Best friends.

548
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,000
- Good night.
- Thanks, Patrick.

549
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,400
Okay. Bye.

550
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,120
I better go. I'll miss you.

551
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,360
- Have fun. I love you.
- Take pictures.

552
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,440
- I'll call you tonight.
- Cool.

553
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,640
I'll keep a close eye on him.

554
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,000
You stopped kissing first.

555
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,840
- I can't believe she told you about us.
- Yeah.

556
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,920
I can't make her love me
if she doesn't.

557
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,720
It isn't you, Patrick.

558
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,000
You're right.

559
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,720
God, if she only knew how many guys
her fiancé scared off.

560
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,080
- Really?
- Yeah.

561
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,520
- How many? Who? Come on, tell me.
- Well...

562
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,920
- Brent Patterson?
- Brent, and Josh Sloane...

563
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,840
Wait, I thought Brent Patterson
had a crush on Cassidy.

564
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,920
He's tired of her leading him on,
or so I heard.

565
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,680
What's your Brent Patterson fantasy?

566
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,760
Cop.

567
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,920
Personal trainer.

568
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,240
You know, he has a little fantasy
about you.

569
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,760
All right...

570
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,360
- Come on, you said...
- No. I know what I said, but no. No.

571
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,320
Native Americans
helped to complete...

572
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:24,240
...the construction
of the Carmel Mission in 1771.

573
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,000
This is the stone that commemorates
the life of the founder of this mission.

574
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,040
Okay, everybody, let's move on.

575
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,880
Take this.

576
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,320
Come with me.

577
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,200
Yeah, it's...

578
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,400
It's definitely beautiful.

579
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,960
Never thought I'd be cold in California.

580
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,720
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

581
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,520
- Is that better?
- Yeah.

582
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,720
I...

583
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,120
- I gotta go.
- Where?

584
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,520
- My grandmother's, remember?
- Right.

585
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,040
Right, okay.

586
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,960
I'll be back.

587
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,080
We have to talk.

588
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,960
What do you mean we have to talk?

589
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,480
This isn't working out.
I'm sick of feeling like your boy-toy.

590
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,720
Fine. I wouldn't have slept
with you anyway.

591
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,080
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

592
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:26,240
Go blow-dry your hair or lift heavy
stuff or whatever it is guys like you do.

593
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,240
Yeah, I know.

594
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,000
Okay.

595
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,160
Cheers, mate.

596
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,200
- Hello.
- Hey.

597
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,880
- Brent.
- Alison.

598
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,200
- I was just leaving.
- You mind?

599
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,920
No.

600
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,120
Hi.

601
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,200
She's a tough old gal.

602
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,760
She gave me this...

603
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,520
...for good luck.

604
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,440
I'm glad you came.

605
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,320
Me too.

606
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,560
Are you a risk-taker?

607
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,440
It depends...

608
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,920
...on the risk.

609
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,800
How about a coin toss?
It's the simplest of risks.

610
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,720
Heads, tails, win or lose.

611
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,280
First, for this dollar here.
Heads or tails?

612
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,080
Heads.

613
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,240
Heads. It's yours.

614
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,600
- Now for the relationship.
- What?

615
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,920
Our relationship.

616
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,400
We flip to see what it is.
I mean, you're confused, right?

617
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:55,600
So am I. Are we buddy-buddy or...

618
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,920
I got it...

619
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,440
...master-slave.

620
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,440
Quit it.

621
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,880
Whoever wins the flip
decides who's master...

622
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,600
...and who's slave, just for the night.

623
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,920
Slave is slave, and master's master.

624
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:18,520
- So, what's this all about?
- What do you mean?

625
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,640
Dinner, flowers...

626
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,720
...it's all just a little...

627
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,680
...sudden.

628
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,560
Look at all the stars tonight.

629
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,800
You know, they say that you can see
the Crab Nebula. Wow, look...

630
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,160
What are you trying to do?

631
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,960
What are you trying to do?

632
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,720
I'm saying, play with me.

633
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,960
- Stop it, Jason.
- Why?

634
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,200
- Why? You know why.
- Michael?

635
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,240
Yes, Michael. Of course, Michael.

636
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,640
Look, I want you, Sheila.

637
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,600
I want you so bad.

638
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,360
You've imagined what it would
be like to be with me, haven't you?

639
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,760
Please.

640
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,840
You have.

641
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,680
The more you try and hide it, the more
it shows, like at the church today.

642
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,760
Admit it, you want to do this
with Michael off somewhere else.

643
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,400
No, I don't.

644
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,720
Heads or tails?

645
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,200
Heads or tails?

646
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,520
- Jason.
- Come on.

647
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,680
Tails.

648
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,800
Tails.

649
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,800
So who are you...

650
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,440
...master or slave?

651
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,280
Master or slave?

652
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,080
Slave.

653
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,920
Not yet.

654
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,720
Not yet.

655
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,080
Michael.

656
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,520
It's Jason.

657
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,480
Yeah, we're fine.

658
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,960
Yeah, she's right here. Hold on.

659
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,120
Keep talking no matter what.

660
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,280
No matter what.

661
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,520
Hey, baby.

662
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,720
I haven't heard from you.
How are you?

663
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,440
- Good. How are you?
- Okay.

664
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,840
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

665
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,280
- Yeah, so tell me everything.
- Oh, Carmel's beautiful.

666
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,680
- How's the weather?
- It's pouring rain.

667
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,320
- What?
- Sheila, what are you guys doing?

668
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,240
- Just hanging out.
- You sound weird.

669
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,440
- What?
- I said, you sound weird.

670
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,280
Is something wrong?

671
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,560
No.

672
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,680
You're sure you're okay?

673
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,640
Hello? Honey, what are you doing?

674
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,240
What?

675
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,560
Sheila, you're freaking me out.

676
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,240
- What's going on?
- I'm fine.

677
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,840
- Sheila.
- What, baby?

678
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,200
Are you okay?

679
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,720
I'm gonna... I'm gonna call you back.

680
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,440
Wait, wait, wait. Hon.

681
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,400
Sheila.

682
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,800
- Who is it?
- It's me. It's Alison.

683
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,240
Oh, my God, what happened?

684
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,280
I cheated on David.

685
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,960
Brent?

686
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,120
Look, you made a mistake.
Don't worry, it's all...

687
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,840
No, it's not okay.
You don't understand.

688
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,040
- David trusted me to come out here.
- David doesn't have to know.

689
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,640
It's not just David. It's my family,
it's his family, it's...

690
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,400
You don't have to tell them anything.

691
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,720
- I don't feel good.
- Just don't tell them.

692
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,760
- I have to go.
- Are you sure?

693
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,400
- Yes.
- You're gonna be okay?

694
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,400
Yes, I'm sure.

695
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,200
Come in.

696
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,240
- Alison.
- Patrick.

697
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,280
What's wrong? What's wrong?

698
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,840
Tell me, was he good?

699
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,960
Did you keep something
to remember him by?

700
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,480
- What?
- Brent.

701
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,960
Did you keep something
to remember him by?

702
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,160
You know?

703
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,760
Open it.

704
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,320
- I don't understand.
- You will.

705
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,360
- These are...
- A little out of focus.

706
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:27,000
I'm not really much of a photographer,
but I'd say they turned out okay.

707
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,120
- How did you...
- Quiet.

708
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,880
- What are you doing? Patrick!
- I said, quiet.

709
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,720
Now, you listen to me,
and you listen good.

710
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,000
Somewhere, there's an envelope
addressed to David Crestwood...

711
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,040
...at 7348 Ram Place, Newport,
Rhode Island.

712
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,320
In that envelope are more pictures,
so if you don't keep your mouth shut...

713
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,320
...that envelope's gonna find
a mailbox. You understand me?

714
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,400
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

715
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,040
Good, because if you don't...

716
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,680
...your fiancé won't be the only one
who sees these.

717
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,760
I've got some for his family,
for your family... Oh, stop crying.

718
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,920
They're not gonna go anywhere if you
just show me the respect I deserve.

719
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,360
l...

720
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,160
- How? How?
- Put Brent up to it?

721
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,200
I paid him 500 bucks to forget
about Cassidy and sleep with you.

722
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,480
Don't tell anyone.

723
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,680
He asked for 1000,
can you believe that?

724
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,720
He must have student loans to pay off.
Either that, or you just aren't his type.

725
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,200
Oh, you are sick!

726
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,960
Who's sick? I cared for you, and you
rejected me for David Crestwood...

727
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,880
...who you just betrayed
for a fucking piece of ass.

728
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:43,000
David was good enough for you,
Brent was good enough for you...

729
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:48,880
...and now I'm good enough for you.
- Patrick, please don't do this. Please.

730
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,920
Yeah, of course I called her back,
but there's no fucking answer. Shit!

731
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,960
Maybe I'm wrong,
but it sounded like they were...

732
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,200
- I mean, am I crazy?
- I could see it between them.

733
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:13,040
You don't know Jason.
He can't control himself.

734
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,760
Oh, I am gonna kill him.

735
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,240
You do, and the whole campus
will hear the story.

736
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:22,680
- What am I supposed to do?
- Well, there is one thing.

737
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,040
- Thank you.
- It's been my pleasure.

738
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,960
- So where's Michael?
- Off, thinking of me.

739
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:36,560
Why, is something wrong?
I mean, other than with Mamaw's hips.

740
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,040
You've been meddling.

741
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,080
Why does it matter to you
what I do with Michael?

742
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,520
You're jealous. You are.

743
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,560
You said you didn't want to fuck me.
I never said I didn't want to fuck you.

744
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:54,320
Admit it, you care about me.
All this and brains too?

745
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,400
- I think it's you who's jealous.
- You might be right.

746
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,640
Jason, I can't believe you don't want
to see the pictures.

747
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,600
- Not interested.
- So it's a tie. We're still roommates.

748
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,840
- I didn't know you had it in you.
- Yeah? How's Alison?

749
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,080
After this, they either gain or lose
weight. Guessing she'll lose weight.

750
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,640
What? She needs to drop
the freshman 15.

751
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,400
- What you did was wrong.
- What about you and Sheila?

752
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:38,680
We both had a good time.
What did Alison ever do to you?

753
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,520
You have no fucking idea.

754
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,240
- I'm out.
- Too late.

755
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,720
- This is weird.
- What is?

756
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,240
Well, Patrick and I don't have
anything going on, and I'm not bored.

757
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,320
How do you feel?

758
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,560
- Happy.
- Me too.

759
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,240
One truth?

760
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,120
One?

761
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,720
After you saw me mind-fuck Michael
into replacing him on that trip...

762
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,240
...did you ever fantasize about me?

763
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,240
Maybe.

764
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,480
Do you believe in second chances?

765
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:09,840
If I died and I got the chance to
come back for one day, any day...

766
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,360
...l'd choose this one.

767
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,480
That is so pathetic.

768
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,600
- Seriously, that's your best material?
- It's not material. It's how I feel.

769
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,160
Here.

770
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,800
Now, does that feel like a guy
who's using material?

771
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,600
God, Cassidy, when I look at you,
I can barely put two words together.

772
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,800
Then don't.

773
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,760
Slow.

774
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,360
Slow works for me.

775
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,800
There's something I need to tell you.

776
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,800
I'm having dinner
with Patrick tomorrow.

777
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,520
- I'm sorry?
- We set it up a while back.

778
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:16,400
He insisted. I have to get rid of him.

779
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,040
Yes, well, you try and
keep your food down.

780
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,600
This better be good.

781
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,280
Do you ever wonder
why we are the way we are?

782
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,720
- What do you mean?
- Morally out there?

783
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,360
I'm not quite so far out there,
but I was born with certain qualities.

784
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,320
I wanted to take advantage of them.

785
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,600
I was born without those qualities.
When people met me...

786
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,040
...they were unimpressed,
so I had to impress myself on them.

787
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,160
I admire you, Cassidy, and I want you.

788
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,000
I already gave you that.

789
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,440
If I had satisfied you,
then you would've been suspicious.

790
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,360
But let me satisfy you now.

791
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,720
Tie you to the bedpost.

792
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,720
I'm a master at two things:
causing girls pain and pleasure.

793
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,440
I've already caused you pain.
That leaves one thing.

794
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,120
You and I are alike.

795
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,800
Sleeping with you now
would just seem incestuous.

796
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,800
We didn't even make it past sake.

797
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,200
Tell me.

798
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:17,960
Patrick said something
about how we're alike.

799
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,600
No, we're different from him.

800
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,480
See, we're fucked up, but he's...

801
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,600
Well, he's fucked up.

802
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,920
Pay less attention to Patrick
and more to me.

803
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,800
- Why so protective?
- Because.

804
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,920
- Because?
- Just because.

805
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,280
Just because?

806
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:39,360
Because I care about you.
Do I have to spell it out for you?

807
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,600
If I don't want you eating with Patrick,
it's because, yes...

808
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,960
...l'm jealous, and I'm worried.

809
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,920
What do you want?

810
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,000
And that's not all.

811
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,600
My dad's talking about expanding
his property holdings out west.

812
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,040
Yeah?

813
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,720
I'm thinking about staying
in Southern California.

814
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,560
We need to talk.

815
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,360
Maybe later.

816
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,680
Now.

817
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,080
I know a good exterminator.

818
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,400
This will take a second.

819
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,520
What's up?

820
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,400
I have a proposition for you.

821
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,120
I told you, I'm out.

822
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:27,600
- You telling me you're satisfied?
- Weren't Alison and Sheila enough?

823
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,360
They were nothing.
Fish so small we threw them back...

824
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,720
...while the big one got away.
- The big one?

825
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,520
There's only one girl
worth competing for now.

826
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,840
First we cooperated and fucked her...

827
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,840
...then she suggested our competition.

828
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,960
What's left except
competing for Cassidy?

829
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,520
No, I'm not competing for Cassidy.

830
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,440
Fuck you.

831
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,880
You're practically in her pants already.

832
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:53,760
No, we're taking things slow.

833
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,160
So you'll be pissed if I get up her first?

834
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:00,160
This began with Cassidy and us,
this has to end with Cassidy and us.

835
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,080
You two suddenly have feelings.
What are you afraid of?

836
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,480
- Not you.
- What's wrong?

837
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,760
You're trying to win her anyway.

838
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,480
Beat me.

839
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,880
Rub my nose in it.

840
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,320
You know you want to.

841
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,800
Don't be a fucking pussy.

842
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,880
- What do I win?
- To make it official?

843
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,960
One dollar.

844
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,720
Good luck.

845
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,880
You got my note.

846
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,200
Pretty serious stuff.

847
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,960
So let me get this straight,
you're in love with me?

848
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,400
Sucks to be me.

849
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,360
So did you...

850
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,360
Did you change your mind?

851
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,840
I've come to say
that I've figured you out.

852
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:07,000
You've noticed that Jason and I are in
love, and you're trying to break us up.

853
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,040
What?

854
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,600
You know I don't fall that easy.

855
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,280
You and Jason always had a thing.

856
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,440
But we only just fell in love.

857
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,680
So you only just started caring.

858
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,160
Cass, I've always cared.

859
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:30,280
Do you care that no one's
ever gonna fall in love with you?

860
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,200
I don't know if you can love...

861
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,320
...but you like hating more anyway.

862
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,640
Are you uglier on the outside
or on the inside?

863
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,520
When you've been ignored as long as
I, we'll see what you do to get noticed.

864
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:45,560
Take it from me, you would
rather get fucked than ignored.

865
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,680
I guess so.

866
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,040
You can't sweep me under the rug...

867
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:56,200
...any more than my parents,
my school or this fucking world.

868
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,040
You sweep too much under the rug...

869
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,800
...suddenly the rug's not big enough
to cover it all.

870
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,520
You really love Jason.

871
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,560
- Yes.
- And he really loves you?

872
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,360
Yes.

873
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,960
You sound so sure...

874
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,120
...but love is blind.

875
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:18,320
It's too late to change my mind.
I'm meeting Jason at 8.

876
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,120
Jason doesn't love you.

877
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,480
What if I said,
not once, but twice now...

878
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,600
...you've been the prize
in one of our little contests?

879
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:32,000
What if I said Jason
and I made a bet...

880
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,920
...to see who could make you forget
what we did to you...

881
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,880
...and fuck with your mind and body
all over again?

882
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Did you hear what I said, Cassidy?

883
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,480
Jason doesn't love you.

884
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,920
He just wants to fuck you
so he can win the bet.

885
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,080
That's not true.

886
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,320
You know it is.

887
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:54,000
Jason wouldn't do that to me.

888
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,200
You know Jason.

889
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,160
It was as much your bet as it was his.

890
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,200
Yeah, but I'm telling you about it.

891
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,240
Do you think Jason
was going to tell you about it?

892
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,720
Trust the truth.

893
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,960
I want you, Cassidy.

894
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,440
I don't want you under false pretenses.

895
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,640
I want you here and now.

896
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,480
I can't.

897
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,760
I've never met anyone like you...

898
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,240
...and you've never met
anyone like me.

899
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,920
I am the only guy
on the face of the earth...

900
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,680
...who's worthy to be
in the same room with you.

901
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,400
For once, I'm telling it like it is.

902
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,320
Trust me.

903
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,240
You can tie me down.

904
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,000
For you.

905
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,480
Jesus. What happened?

906
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,840
You had to choose
between me and Patrick...

907
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,400
...and you chose Patrick.

908
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,520
If it's Patrick you want...

909
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,360
Jason, Jason, Jason.

910
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,800
I crossed the finish line
a half-hour ago.

911
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:15,600
But don't feel bad,
I've never won by less.

912
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,280
How could you?

913
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,800
I really loved you.

914
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,160
I loved you too.

915
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,200
There's no such thing.

916
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,480
Now I'd like you both
to leave me alone.

917
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:30,600
First I want Jason to tell me
what it's like to be a victim.

918
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,400
Fuck you.

919
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,000
Actually, you're both my victims.

920
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,280
- Why?
- Because you were in love...

921
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,920
...and now you're not.
See what happens...

922
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:44,360
...when you underestimate?
- We underestimated the evil in you?

923
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,800
You underestimated the evil
in yourselves.

924
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,600
So you don't know what it feels
like to be a victim?

925
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,800
- No.
- I'd love to teach you.

926
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,760
Sorry, I've got plans.

927
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:01,720
I'm sorry too. But once
you've been convicted of my rape...

928
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,880
...you won't be making any plans.

929
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,240
I thought we weren't going to tell him.

930
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,560
Sorry, I just had to see his face.

931
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,280
You know, she's gonna charge you
with sexual assault.

932
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,480
I'm sure the authorities
will be sympathetic.

933
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,720
Semen samples, fingerprints...

934
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,200
...wrist abrasions...

935
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,840
...torn clothes...

936
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,480
...plus one of your sleeping pills...

937
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,960
...in my bloodstream.

938
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,640
Recognize?

939
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,800
Jason swiped them.

940
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,680
I just took one myself...

941
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,600
...but the doctor won't know
the difference.

942
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:42,840
Patrick came over to talk...

943
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,840
...but he must have slipped
something into the wine...

944
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,640
...because I started to feel sleepy.

945
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,280
And then...

946
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,840
...he locked the door.

947
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,160
And then he grabbed me...

948
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,200
...and tried to tie me down.

949
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:05,480
I tried to struggle,
but the knots were so tight.

950
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,920
And then...

951
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,520
...he raped me.

952
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,520
If only I had arrived in time.
I mean, I could've helped.

953
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,160
See what happens
when you underestimate?

954
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,680
You took me so lightly.

955
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,000
So I suggested
the Sheila-Alison thing...

956
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,240
...because I knew a competition
for them...

957
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,280
...would lead to a competition for me.

958
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:31,480
Alison was a tough nut
until I dangled Brent in front of you.

959
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,160
That's when you got the idea...

960
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,920
...that maybe Brent could go places
you couldn't.

961
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,200
And what do you know...

962
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,680
...your little game with Sheila
and Alison ended in a photo finish...

963
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,760
...which led you right back
to you-know-who.

964
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,080
Only you weren't competing for me...

965
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,840
...you were competing against me.

966
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,600
And this time,
Jason and I got to each other first.

967
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:57,680
After what you did to Alison,
I was happy to help.

968
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,280
So...

969
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,320
...here's your dollar.

970
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,880
I'm looking forward to having
my own room.

971
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,720
And you're off to prison...

972
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,600
...where the sex is never boring.

973
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,600
The police should be
out front right about now.

974
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,520
They were called 20 minutes ago.

975
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:20,600
You're a fucking bitch!
They will never believe you.

976
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,560
Right the first time.

977
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,520
Open up.

978
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,840
Would you tell me
what this is all about, please?

979
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,040
We'll let you know down at the station.

980
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,800
I'm... I'm not sure exactly.

981
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:38,000
I think he slipped something
into my drink.

982
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,680
This is ridiculous.
It's her word against mine.

983
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,160
She's lying.

984
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,720
- I don't have to say anything...
- We know.

985
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,920
...but I want to clear my name
from the lies of a jilted person.

986
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,520
I think you should know, Mr. Bates,
another victim has come forward.

987
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,040
Watch your head, now.

988
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,640
Come on guys, back up.

989
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,360
Tell me how this ends.

990
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:34,760
Ends?

991
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,760
You and me.

992
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,680
It's still kind of soon.

993
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:41,040
If it means anything,
I'm done playing games.

994
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,280
What you did, it wasn't easy...

995
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:44,880
...but I know why you did it.

996
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,480
- Why?
- Because after everything...

997
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,840
...that we put you through,
you finally wanted out.

998
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,800
Wrong.

999
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,040
I wanted back in.

1000
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:59,240
See, Patrick's out of the way,
Prince Christopher's had time to heal...

1001
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,320
Ten thousand bucks says I can be
down those swim trunks by midnight.

1002
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,320
What about us? I mean...

1003
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,360
The only problem fucking
with someone as twisted as yourself...

1004
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,600
...is you're fucking with someone
as twisted as yourself.

1005
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,640
Well?

1006
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,040
I knew you'd understand.

1007
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:24,800
Did you have a nice swim?

1008
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,160
Yes, thank you.

1009
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,120
Let's go get a drink.

1010
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,160
Why the hell not?

1011
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:40,000
