1
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:16,283
<i>A movie actress</i>
<i>and four of her friends</i>
<i>were murdered.</i>

2
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,285
<i>The circumstances were lurid.</i>

3
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:23,223
<i>- The lawyer Paul Caruso said</i>
<i>five people dressed in black</i>
<i>entered Ms. Tate's home</i>

4
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:25,827
<i>after cutting the power</i>
<i>and telephone lines,</i>

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,263
<i>and went methodically</i>
<i>about the business</i>
<i>of killing five people.</i>

6
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:33,835
<i>Caruso represents Susan Atkins,</i>
<i>a member of the gang or commune.</i>

7
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:37,204
<i>He said she and the others</i>
<i>were completely</i>
<i>under what he called:</i>

8
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,206
<i>"The insane influence</i>
<i>of Charles Manson."</i>

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,809
<i>You consider yourself</i>
<i>a member of a religious order?</i>

10
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:44,211
<i>- In a sense. Mm-hmm.</i>

11
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,316
<i>Believe me,</i>
<i>if I started murdering people...</i>

12
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:53,353
<i>...there'd be none of you left.</i>

13
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:59,092
<i>The mind that you live in,</i>
<i>the thought that you live in...</i>

14
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:00,595
<i>is a family.</i>

15
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,730
<i>- You scared to die?</i>

16
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:08,302
<i>- Sometimes I feel</i>
<i>I'm scared to live.</i>

17
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,672
<i>Living's what scares me.</i>

18
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,708
<i>Dying is easy.</i>

19
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,534
- Oh, sh...

20
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:48,876
- Whoa! Do not hurt him.

21
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:53,848
Come on back, man!

22
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,754
- We just want to talk, man!
- Come on!
- Come on, man!

23
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,902
- Ah!
- That all you got?
- It's not gonna hurt you.

24
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:17,772
- No! No! No!

25
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:24,478
- Come on!
- Look at me! Look at me!

26
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,829
<i>- Charlie, you can't leave</i>
<i>your sheep behind.</i>

27
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:43,831
<i>You're the shepherd,</i>
<i>you have to herd.</i>

28
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,535
<i>You created this movement.</i>
<i>You can't go.</i>

29
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,369
<i>I don't want you to go.</i>

30
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:53,373
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna fucking kill this guy.

31
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,909
Can you just cut the camera?

32
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:57,512
- Yeah. Alright.

33
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,416
Should I call the landlord?

34
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:06,486
- No, I've already called him,
like, 20 times.
- Okay.

35
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:09,423
Do you want me to, like,
go over there and talk to him?

36
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,559
- No, Mitch.
Don't worry about it.

37
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,663
I'm sorry. It's just...
it's a really big callback.

38
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,466
- I know.

39
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:22,837
- Fuck it.
I'm gonna book a place.

40
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,609
- Tiana, you really think
the background's gonna make
that big of a difference?

41
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:33,614
- Baby, casting these days...
I have friends who literally
shoot on location and they book.

42
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,616
I guarantee you if we shoot
in the desert,

43
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,652
it's gonna look
that much better.

44
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,588
Look. This place is perfect.
It's 70 bucks.

45
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,793
Give me half the day to shoot
and I'm yours
the rest of the weekend.

46
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:48,763
- I still don't really get it,
to be honest with you.

47
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:52,499
- You don't get it
'cause it's arthouse.
- Arthouse. Please.

48
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,770
They're making Charles Manson
look like a good guy.
Don't see how that's arthouse.

49
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:57,772
- No, I think the director's
vision is he's trying

50
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,907
to make him look like a prophet
or something.

51
00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:02,910
You know, he's trying to show
how his followers saw him
before he died.

52
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,912
- A prophet?
- Yeah. Historically,

53
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:07,515
they thought he was
the second coming of Jesus.

54
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:10,350
- Does the director have him
walking on water too?

55
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,687
Coming out of the grave?

56
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:50,490
- I lost my fiancé... Ben.

57
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,796
It was last November.

58
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,632
It was cancer.

59
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,705
I know sometimes I feel like...
I feel like it was my fault.

60
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,010
You know, I feel like... I feel
like I really could've just...

61
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,079
- Could've what, Tiana?

62
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:15,516
- I don't know.

63
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:22,890
- It's natural to feel
a sense of responsibility
for the ones we lost.

64
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:25,092
But the reality is...

65
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:27,929
...you don't control cancer.

66
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,598
There's nothing you could do.

67
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,346
- Mm, uh...

68
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:49,617
Nice little store you got here,
my friend.

69
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,753
Yeah, this is it for me, I...

70
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,957
You got sunblock?

71
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,425
- Yeah. And you know what? Ahem.

72
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,995
This here's on the house.

73
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,564
Gets real hot out there.

74
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:07,101
And you need to protect
that skin of yours.

75
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,870
Keep that colour.

76
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:11,438
Just about perfect.

77
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:16,677
Hey, no drinks, but, uh...

78
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:21,015
...the locals are pleasant.

79
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,085
You good?

80
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:25,553
- Yeah.

81
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:31,458
- You got the address?
- Yeah.

82
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,867
- Okay, that's where it is.

83
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:45,472
Definitely seeing some
drunk bowling tonight.

84
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,148
What, just right here?
- Yeah.

85
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,497
- Fucking awesome.
There's no service.

86
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:13,466
I thought the ad said
there would be internet.

87
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,202
- Uh, would you hand me mine,
actually?

88
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,775
- What?

89
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:23,010
- Nothing. Grace just wanted me
to call her.

90
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:26,047
I'm gonna have to head back
into town and grab service.

91
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,050
May as well grab us some drinks
while I'm out?

92
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,053
Actually, uh,
you want to just come with?

93
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:34,789
You know I suck
at picking mixers anyways.

94
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,059
- I'll be fine.

95
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,928
Seriously, Mitch.

96
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:52,740
- Well... groovy.

97
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,144
- Thanks.
- Alright.

98
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,646
Everything's in the room.

99
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,650
Last chance.

100
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,786
- Strawberry.
- Whatever.

101
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,654
Alright, I'll be right back.

102
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,932
I got your text earlier.
What's going on?

103
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,635
<i>Okay, don't freak out,</i>
<i>but I can't come tonight.</i>

104
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,236
<i>Judge finally granted us</i>
<i>that warrant.</i>

105
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,773
- Grace.
<i>- Mitch, I'm sorry. I really am.</i>
<i>It's just...</i>

106
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,311
Can I at least come
tomorrow night
or the night after instead?

107
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,213
- Yeah.

108
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,115
Yeah, look, just...

109
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,617
<i>just come tomorrow, alright?</i>

110
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:46,220
Fuck I... I forgot to leave
your camera out for you.

111
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,156
Look, the camera,
it's in Tiana's desk,
in her bedroom somewhere.

112
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,692
Just grab it on your way.
Her key's under the mat.

113
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,895
- You forget everything,
you know that, right?

114
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:57,298
- Grace, I...

115
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,867
Have you ever heard of a...

116
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,103
a snake eating itself...

117
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:05,339
as a symbol or a tattoo,
something?

118
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:09,310
- Mitch, how about you just
focus on your lady, okay?

119
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,278
- Yeah. Thanks.

120
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,829
Mitch?

121
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:40,708

Okay. Uh...

I mean, yeah, it's cool.
I get it.

138
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:45,065
Especially... everything
that happened with Ben and...

139
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,037
- Hey!

140
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:10,585
Hey.

141
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:13,020
What?

142
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,356
You're gonna crush this, okay?

143
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,592
I'm serious.
No one deserves it more.

144
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:25,265
Can I ask you something?

145
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,569
- Sure.

146
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:33,941
- Why do you want this one
so bad?

147
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:40,548
- In the script,
Annie loses her family
before she meets Manson.

148
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:46,554
And it hurts her so bad, uh,
she starts hurting herself.

149
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:51,892
I know the script is silly,
but I just... this role...

150
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,361
...it's me.

151
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,404
- Well, I think that they would
be fucking lucky to have you.

152
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:13,213
Hey, uh, I'm gonna...
gonna take a walk. You
want to take a little break?

153
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,016
- Sooner I get this done,
the sooner I can kick your ass
in bowling.

154
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,086
- Good luck. I love you.
- Love you.

155
00:15:58,593 --> 00:16:00,427
- Maybe this could work.

156
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:13,575
Yeah...

157
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,312
What would you say? You just...

158
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,016
Tiana Williams...

159
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,453
...will you...
No, that's fucking lame.

160
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:34,261
Well, uh...

161
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,554
- Howdy.

162
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:34,789
- Hey.

163
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,592
What's up, man?

164
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,460
- Just taking care of business.

165
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:46,199
They're for a...
rattle roundup.

166
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,604
We sell the skins down in Indio.

167
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:51,305
- That's cool.
- You?

168
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:53,508
- Uh, just a vacation.

169
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,711
- Vacation. Vacation!
Come on, man!

170
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:59,681
I saw you up there practicing.

171
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:01,516
Come on, let's see it.

172
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:06,588
- You want to see the ring?
- Today, junior. Come on.

173
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:11,826
Damn...

174
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:14,494
That's a nice rock.
You must really love her, huh?

175
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:17,497
- Thank you. I... I do.

176
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,435
- She have any idea?

177
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:25,907
- I don't know, man. I hope not.
- I hope not!

178
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,642
I hope not.

179
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,479
What's in the jar?

180
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:35,817
- Uh... ashes.

181
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,352
Relative died recently.

182
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:45,693
- Oh, I'm sorry, man.

183
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:48,362
That...
Is that gravestone yours too?

184
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:52,399
- Mm-hmm. Travis.

185
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,201
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

186
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,803
Good pup, he was.

187
00:18:57,572 --> 00:18:59,139
Good pup.

188
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:01,843
- Um... sorry to hear that.

189
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:05,613
I hope you, uh,
you find a good spot or...

190
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:08,215
or... whatever, you know?

191
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:17,190
- Hey! You ought to wear a hat
around here.

192
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:20,460
The sun, it'll, uh,
darken up your face.

193
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:23,531
A man only gets to propose once.

194
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,772
- You know it, brother. Yeah.
Hey, it was nice to meet you.

195
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:33,775
- You take care now!
- Yeah, you too, man. You too.

196
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:46,319
<i>Even though they have rebelled</i>
<i>against that society?</i>

197
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:49,256
<i>Well, uh, who...</i>
<i>They weren't born rebelling.</i>

198
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:52,392
<i>They weren't born with, uh...</i>

199
00:19:53,795 --> 00:19:57,364
<i>The mind that you live in,</i>
<i>the thought that you live in...</i>

200
00:19:57,965 --> 00:19:59,767
<i>...is a family.</i>

201
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:03,738
<i>Uh, uh, the anger</i>
<i>and frustration that they have,</i>

202
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:05,673
<i>that had to be put on them</i>
<i>by somebody.</i>

203
00:20:05,707 --> 00:20:07,642
<i>Somebody created them.</i>

204
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:09,376
<i>Uh, it's as if...</i>

205
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,945
<i>if you're outside...</i>

206
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:14,515
<i>...and you live a life...</i>

207
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,652
<i>...on the outside.</i>

208
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:36,537
<i>He's lost sight</i>
<i>of his children.</i>

209
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:41,341
<i>He doesn't see in the back.</i>
<i>He doesn't see in the shadows.</i>
- What are you watching?

210
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:45,847
<i>Do guys belong on</i>
<i>a death row or a condemned row</i>
<i>if there is such a row?</i>

211
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,782
- T?
- I found it.

212
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:50,651
- You found what?
- I found a way in.

213
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:53,888
Like, I already knew it,
but to connect Annie, I...

214
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:56,991
It's fire monk.

215
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:59,827
- Hmm. Fire monk?

216
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,667
- Ready to shoot?
- Yeah, definitely. I just...
want to get cleaned up first.

217
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:08,736
- You have my permission.
- Whatever.

218
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,739
- Can you turn the AC on?
It's fucking hot.
- Yeah, one sec.

219
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,410
<i>Tiana...</i>

220
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:55,016
<i>...first time I saw you,</i>
<i>I knew that I loved...</i>

221
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:58,351
No. Jesus,
why is this so fucking hard?

222
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,492
When I used to think
about my wedding...

223
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:09,462
...well, I'd just get sad,
because...

224
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:14,802
...all I could think about
was how my dad wasn't gonna
be there to enjoy it with me.

225
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,874
But now all I see is...
you walking down the aisle.

226
00:22:43,564 --> 00:22:44,899
Damn.

227
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:50,838
- Have you ever heard of this?
There's a monk from the '60s,
he set himself on fire.

228
00:22:50,872 --> 00:22:53,541
He was protesting the corrupt
government in Vietnam,

229
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:56,544
and just a mere photo of the act
revolutionized the world.

230
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:58,946
- I'm sorry. Wait.
Am I the fire monk here?

231
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:05,653
- So... when are you actually
gonna tell me your story?

232
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:09,422
- I don't know. Haven't decided.

233
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:14,161
- You're not comfortable yet?
- No. Not really, no.
That was just my first meeting.

234
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,698
- I meant right now.

235
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:24,872
- My dad...

236
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,143
...he was off-duty,
driving me and my sister home
in Virginia.

237
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:32,747
We pull into the gas station.

238
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:36,817
A couple kids run out,
masked up.

239
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:39,153
Dad tried to stop 'em.

240
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:42,455
One of 'em had a Glock.

241
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:44,926
What?

242
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:47,161
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Cheers.

243
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:54,001
Mind if I sip on this one?
I'd actually like to remember
tonight.

244
00:23:54,035 --> 00:23:57,838
- Why is that?
- Because I find you
interesting.

245
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,110
Yeah, and you have this, uh...
fuck-off mentality,

246
00:24:03,144 --> 00:24:06,914
but once you get past that,
you're really
quite a charming person.

247
00:24:08,783 --> 00:24:12,153
- Are you flirting with me?
- You want me to?

248
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:03,237
Holy shit!

249
00:25:05,072 --> 00:25:07,041
You actually pull it off,
no lie.

250
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:08,909
- You look handsome.
- Mm.

251
00:25:08,943 --> 00:25:12,646
- Not a lot of fancy restaurants
around here, though.
- Yeah, just you.

252
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:17,218
- You ready to do this?
- Oh, yeah. I'll be out front.
You really do look awesome.

253
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:22,256
- Big black bug
bit a big black bear,

254
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:25,059
and the big black bear
bleed blood.

255
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,763
Big black bug
bit a big black bear,

256
00:25:28,796 --> 00:25:30,831
and a big black bear
bleed blood.

257
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:33,134
Big black bear bit
a big black bug and...

258
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,869
- Fucking actors, man.

259
00:25:34,902 --> 00:25:37,304
- Big black bug bit
a big black bear,

260
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:39,840
and the big black bear
bleed blood.

261
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:41,642
This is my mark?

262
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:42,910
- Yeah.

263
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:48,883
Alright. Damn, you went in
with the character prep.

264
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:51,819
- Yeah, it was hard
getting inside of Annie's head.

265
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:54,321
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:57,324
- Alright. We are... rolling.

267
00:26:01,695 --> 00:26:04,065
- I'm getting tired, Charlie!
- You can do it, Annie.

268
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:07,301
Find your inner power.
Robert, dump the body.

269
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:10,171
Don't get queasy on me now,
Annie. These politicians,
they don't care.

270
00:26:10,204 --> 00:26:11,872
They don't care about you.

271
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:13,741
- You care.
- Amen.

272
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:18,712
- What will do in the new world?

273
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:21,882
- There's so much anger
in this world, Annie,
so much hate.

274
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,385
The new world is all chill
all day.

275
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:26,987
The white way.
Grass and ass, you dig?

276
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:30,191
- Messiah.
- Let me tell y'all,

277
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:32,626
I'll be long gone
before the new world,

278
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,196
and it's up to you
to complete the circle of life.

279
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,932
Charlie's will is Man's son.

280
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:39,767
- Charlie's will
is Man's son.

281
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,838
- Charlie's will is Man's son.
- Charlie's will is Man's son!

282
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:53,314
- Boom. Got it.

283
00:26:55,382 --> 00:26:57,218
- That felt good.
- Yeah.

284
00:27:02,056 --> 00:27:03,757
What do you think?

285
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:06,293
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I dig that.

286
00:27:06,327 --> 00:27:08,896
- Me, too.
I thought it was great.
You want to do one more?

287
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:10,931
- No.
- No.
- Good job.

288
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:13,300
You really brought it out in me.

289
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:15,836
- I guess so.
- Let's get into the other
scenes.

290
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,404
- Yeah, go.

291
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:23,644
- Was I right or was I right?
- Yeah, I'm not gonna lie.
It looks pretty awesome.

292
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:04,285
- What's the matter?!

293
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:06,153
Cat got your tongue?!

294
00:28:09,524 --> 00:28:11,158
Quiet now.

295
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:20,034
Mm.

296
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:47,962
Alright, alright, alright.

297
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:51,932
There she is.

298
00:28:53,968 --> 00:28:56,337
Hey... I'm proud of you.

299
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,772
- Okay, shut up.
- No, I'm serious that...

300
00:28:58,806 --> 00:29:01,041
I mean it.
That was really good work
you did out there.

301
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:04,445
I think you're gonna book it.
I have a good feeling.

302
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:06,947
- Okay.
- Alright.

303
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:10,384
- Tiana, you deserve it.
Alright? You do.

304
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:12,853
Come on, you do.

305
00:29:15,322 --> 00:29:17,992
- I was actually thinking
about staying in character
all weekend.

306
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:19,728
- Fuck that.

307
00:29:23,598 --> 00:29:25,299
- You know Margarita?

308
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:27,501
Yes, darling.

309
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:30,204
- Bye, loser.
- Extra tequila.

310
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,562
Ah... Where's the ring?

311
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:47,515
Coming?

312
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:54,154
You want lime juice in yours?

313
00:30:55,456 --> 00:30:56,957
- T, uh...

314
00:30:57,991 --> 00:30:59,960
...you think we have
any neighbours?

315
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:01,428
Fucking--

316
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:04,298
- I'm sorry.
- What the fuck, Tiana?!
- I-I'm sorry.

317
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:06,400
Are you okay?

318
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:08,001
- Um...

319
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:12,973
Yeah.

320
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:14,308
I'm good.

321
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:18,445
- Okay, well,
maybe we just stick to these?

322
00:31:21,516 --> 00:31:24,084
- Sorry. I'm... I'm sorry.

323
00:31:24,118 --> 00:31:26,086
It's just that, uh...

324
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,022
I saw someone today...
on my way back.

325
00:31:29,256 --> 00:31:30,958
- Did he talk to you
or something?

326
00:31:30,991 --> 00:31:32,960
- He was burying
one of his friends.

327
00:31:32,993 --> 00:31:35,462
- He was burying one
of his friends?
- His friend's ashes, but...

328
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:37,164
but yeah, I mean...

329
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:39,400
I don't know, it was weird.

330
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:46,073
I think we should leave early.

331
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:49,209
- What?
Mitch, you're scaring me.
What's going on?

332
00:31:50,545 --> 00:31:53,213
- I don't want to freak you out
and I know I'm being paranoid,

333
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:58,085
but when I went
into the office earlier...
one of the windows was open.

334
00:32:00,187 --> 00:32:03,290
- Mitch, I opened that window
when I was studying.

335
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:06,160
- Tiana, don't laugh. Why
didn't you tell me that earlier?

336
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:09,129
- You want me to tell you
every time I open a window?
- Yeah, I do.

337
00:32:09,163 --> 00:32:11,533
Every time, every window,
please and thank you.

338
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:17,171
- What if it wasn't me?
Someone else broke in.
What would you have done?

339
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:19,440
- I don't know.
- No, come on,
what would you have done?

340
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:22,577
- I don't... I'm not in the mood
for this right now, T.

341
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:26,548
- Pussy.
- "Pussy." Okay, I mean--

342
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:28,949
- Come on,
what would you have done?

343
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:34,188
- I don't know.
I-I guess I would go to town
and contact the police.

344
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:37,057
- Oh, contact the police.
That is every girl's dream.

345
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:41,529
Come on, this is fun.
What would you have done?
Pressure's on. Save me, baby.

346
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:44,131
- I... Alright,
then I guess I would...

347
00:32:44,164 --> 00:32:48,603
I would just... murder the guy
and we'd get into the car...

348
00:32:48,636 --> 00:32:51,405
be the next Bonnie and Clyde.
Is that what you want to hear?

349
00:32:51,438 --> 00:32:55,375
- But what if I had ate
all your candy on the drive
and I was like fat and old,

350
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:57,712
would you still love me,
Mitchell?

351
00:32:57,745 --> 00:33:01,649
- Ms. Williams, I would love you
even if you were the fattest
and the oldest.

352
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,451
I would die for you.

353
00:33:06,754 --> 00:33:08,455
- Don't say that.

354
00:33:09,624 --> 00:33:11,024
- Okay.

355
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:17,599
Well, now I'm gonna say that
all the time.

356
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:19,500
Come on.

357
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:44,484
What?

358
00:35:01,803 --> 00:35:03,638
- Tiana?

359
00:35:03,671 --> 00:35:06,574
- Yeah.
- Is the tile that interesting?

360
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:09,877
- Sorry, just tired.

361
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:15,917
- Hey, I saw your tape.
You were awesome,

362
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,452
even with your neighbours
tapping on the wall.

363
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:20,755
- Yeah.

364
00:35:22,222 --> 00:35:25,258
- Hey, what's up?
You've been acting weird lately.

365
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:26,794
- I'm fine.

366
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:29,496
- Okay. Uh...

367
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:33,500
So I've been thinking,
Thanksgiving being in a couple
weeks and all,

368
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:37,471
um... I was hoping you'd finally
come meet my parents.

369
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:49,282
- Mom?

370
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,488
Dad?

371
00:35:59,527 --> 00:36:00,862
Mom?

372
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:02,730
Dad?

373
00:36:16,978 --> 00:36:18,713
- Shhh.

374
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:24,484
You are very important.

375
00:36:25,553 --> 00:36:27,254
Do you know that?

376
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,224
Yeah?

377
00:36:37,565 --> 00:36:38,800
Hey.

378
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:42,970
Don't tell your mother.

379
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:45,506
Okay?

380
00:36:59,352 --> 00:37:00,555
- Mitch?

381
00:38:55,903 --> 00:38:58,606
Ben? Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

382
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:04,779
What did they do to you?

383
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:10,551
You did this. Mm-hmm.

384
00:39:13,654 --> 00:39:15,422
- I thought you were dead.

385
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:22,530
I'm so sorry.

386
00:39:46,954 --> 00:39:51,025
What the fuck is wrong
with you guys?
Why didn't you tell me?

387
00:39:57,765 --> 00:39:59,066
- Charlie's vision.

388
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:03,004
Dad dug Ben up...
out the ground.

389
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,579
Why isn't he out yet?

390
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:19,987
D'you give him the sedative?

391
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:24,158
I tried. I tried...
I tried to give it to him.

392
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:26,160
- Dad's losing patience.

393
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:31,532
- Huh.

394
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:35,503
- Holy shit, Mom was right.

395
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:38,873
You do love him.

396
00:40:42,643 --> 00:40:44,477
You know what?

397
00:40:47,515 --> 00:40:48,983
Give me the GHB.

398
00:40:49,016 --> 00:40:50,885
- No.
- I'll do it.
- No!

399
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:53,955
No, I-I'll do it.
I'll do it, okay?
I'll do it.

400
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:31,158
- Better not fuck this up, T.

401
00:41:59,954 --> 00:42:02,289
Fuck! Fuck.

402
00:42:03,124 --> 00:42:06,293
Charlie! Charlie, what do I do?
Please, what do I do?

403
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:09,030
Can you please fucking help me?
Please.

404
00:42:15,636 --> 00:42:18,205
Charlie, fucking help me. Fuck.

405
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,641
What do I do? What...

406
00:42:58,279 --> 00:43:00,748
Cheers, Mitch.

407
00:43:00,781 --> 00:43:02,083
Fuck.

408
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:19,834
- Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

409
00:43:21,669 --> 00:43:22,970
Thank you.

410
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:27,174
Thank you! Thank you.

411
00:43:28,843 --> 00:43:32,113
It is my pleasure to accept
the vision award

412
00:43:32,146 --> 00:43:34,715
for outstanding leadership
and tenure.

413
00:43:35,749 --> 00:43:39,186
For outstanding...
for outstanding leadership
and tenure.

414
00:43:40,387 --> 00:43:42,957
By passing HC2...

415
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,893
I've ensured
the beautiful people
of Eastonville...

416
00:43:45,926 --> 00:43:48,229
I've ensured the beautiful
people of Eastonville.

417
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:50,998
People that have been forgotten
by the world!

418
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,903
Become a part of California's
desert reclamation act.

419
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:58,372
People that have become
forgotten by the world

420
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:01,976
become part of the California
desert reclamation act.

421
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:07,081
Paving the way for thousands
of condominiums and grants.

422
00:44:13,754 --> 00:44:15,189
Yes, dear?

423
00:44:17,224 --> 00:44:18,659
What?

424
00:44:23,898 --> 00:44:25,332
Well, I do.

425
00:44:27,134 --> 00:44:29,336
I-I'm gonna come tonight, okay?

426
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,175
Oh, fuck.

427
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:41,916
Ah!!!

428
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,231
Oh, Charlie...

429
00:44:58,132 --> 00:44:59,700
Charlie...

430
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:03,037
...if tonight...

431
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,839
is truly the night,
give me strength, Charlie.

432
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,108
Give me your charisma.

433
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:12,813
Help me guide your sheep...

434
00:45:14,181 --> 00:45:15,416
...Charlie.

435
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:23,791
Help my daughter make that...
right decision.

436
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:26,827
My baby girl.

437
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:32,066
Everything will be alright.

438
00:45:35,102 --> 00:45:36,370
Everything.

439
00:45:39,974 --> 00:45:41,242
Charlie...

440
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,478
John.

441
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:56,824
- Where the hell were you?
- Ah, Tiana.

442
00:45:57,592 --> 00:45:59,260
We gotta go right now.

443
00:45:59,293 --> 00:46:01,128
- Where did you find that?

444
00:46:01,161 --> 00:46:04,398
Mitch!
- In a fucking RV
half a mile away.

445
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:07,901
Where is it, Tiana?
Where is it?!

446
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:09,803
- No, no.
It's right here, sweetie.

447
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:11,405
It's right here.

448
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:20,080
Mitch, Mitch, Mitch,
you were right.
There's somebody here. Yeah.

449
00:46:20,114 --> 00:46:21,949
- Okay. Alright.

450
00:46:25,152 --> 00:46:27,454
Fuck. Alright. Okay.

451
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:30,991
- What is happening?

452
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:36,897
- Oh, Jesus.

453
00:46:38,098 --> 00:46:39,933
What are you doing up?

454
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:42,436
- Me? What are you...
what are you doing outside,
running around?

455
00:46:43,304 --> 00:46:44,938
Mitch?

456
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:46,508
- We're leaving, right now.

457
00:46:58,185 --> 00:47:00,287
I was gonna propose tomorrow.

458
00:47:00,921 --> 00:47:04,024
My ring...
it went missing yesterday.

459
00:47:04,058 --> 00:47:07,194
What the fuck is happening
right now?

460
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:11,899
I went out tonight to find it.
I-I don't... What the fuck?

461
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:15,637
- You... you were gonna...

462
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,372
You were gonna...
you were gonna propose?

463
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:22,409
- I had a plan and everything.
Whoever was back in the RV
obviously fucking stole it.

464
00:47:23,578 --> 00:47:26,947
- - Mitch I... I don't... I--
- You don't what?

465
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:31,085
- What else did you find?

466
00:47:31,118 --> 00:47:36,056
- Just a bunch of weird shit
in your... your script
and your... Fuck.

467
00:47:36,558 --> 00:47:40,127
And a bunch of pictures of you
with other guys?

468
00:47:41,362 --> 00:47:43,197
Why would he have pictures
of you?

469
00:47:44,098 --> 00:47:45,633
- It's my brother.

470
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:49,169
- What do you mean,
it's your brother?

471
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:51,673
Tiana, you don't have a brother.
I need to pull over.

472
00:47:51,706 --> 00:47:55,008
- Just speed up
or he's gonna catch us, Mitch!
Speed now or he's--

473
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:56,578
Speed up!

474
00:47:56,611 --> 00:47:59,913
- Chill the fuck out!
- Speed up! He's gonna catch us!
- Fuck!

475
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:04,118
- What?

476
00:48:10,692 --> 00:48:14,094
- Got yourself another
basket case at New Hope, huh?

477
00:48:16,463 --> 00:48:17,632
- What?

478
00:48:19,466 --> 00:48:21,168
- Poor bastard.

479
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,037
- Travis?

480
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:25,507
- Who else?

481
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:27,941
- What is this?

482
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:32,079
- Oh, this? Well... not sure.

483
00:48:32,747 --> 00:48:36,049
My guess is it's somewhere
between the underworld
and the overworld.

484
00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:41,623
So you think it's gonna work
this time?

485
00:48:41,656 --> 00:48:43,157
- I don't know.

486
00:48:44,158 --> 00:48:45,959
- Do you want it to?

487
00:49:03,043 --> 00:49:04,612
- She's alive!

488
00:49:06,113 --> 00:49:09,082
He ain't as bad off as you,
but, uh...

489
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:13,487
wouldn't exactly call him a...
perfect vessel anymore.

490
00:49:15,055 --> 00:49:18,325
You know, part of me wishes
you wouldn't have made it
out here at all.

491
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:24,599
You know, I do love you, sis.

492
00:49:25,399 --> 00:49:27,569
When they find out about this,
though...

493
00:49:34,274 --> 00:49:35,643
You know...

494
00:49:36,544 --> 00:49:39,313
...you got it easy.
You know that?

495
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:43,383
Living in L.A., dating guys like
Captain fucking America here.

496
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:46,453
You got it easy, you know that?

497
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:49,289
- Why are you talking like this?
Fucking just leave!

498
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:55,730
- Because... I fucking...
like it.

499
00:49:57,231 --> 00:49:59,433
I'm out here
in the fuckin' desert,

500
00:49:59,466 --> 00:50:02,369
confined to a basement doing
fucking science experiments,

501
00:50:02,402 --> 00:50:04,471
and you're the fucking
favourite?!

502
00:50:04,506 --> 00:50:08,041
- Please, Lucas, please. Lucas.
- No, no, no.

503
00:50:08,075 --> 00:50:09,777
You shut the fuck up, T!

504
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:16,216
Left one in there for ya.

505
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:33,300
When Charlie comes back
tonight...

506
00:50:34,434 --> 00:50:36,203
...I'm not gonna lie to him.

507
00:50:37,705 --> 00:50:39,473
I will pray for you, though.

508
00:50:43,711 --> 00:50:45,412
- Lucas?!

509
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:47,815
Lucas!

510
00:50:49,684 --> 00:50:51,586
Lucas!

511
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:53,153
Fuck.

512
00:50:54,187 --> 00:50:55,590
Mitch!

513
00:51:01,629 --> 00:51:03,196
Lucas!

514
00:51:12,707 --> 00:51:14,274
Tiana!

515
00:51:15,777 --> 00:51:17,512
Tiana, open... open the door!

516
00:51:17,545 --> 00:51:19,279
<i>Go away.</i>
<i>- Open the door.</i>

517
00:51:19,313 --> 00:51:21,616
<i>- Mitch, go away!</i>
<i>Mitch, get out!</i>

518
00:51:22,784 --> 00:51:25,319
Mitch, fucking leave.
Get out, please.

519
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:32,560
Not everyone can get over it
that easily, okay?

520
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:36,664
Get out, Mitch!

521
00:51:36,698 --> 00:51:39,232
Fucking say something!
Do you want to say anything?
Please?

522
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:41,536
<i>Fucking say something, Mitch!</i>

523
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:44,505
<i>Get out! Get out! Go!</i>

524
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,107
Get out.

525
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,667
Mitch! Mitch!

526
00:52:37,725 --> 00:52:39,961
Ugh!

527
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:21,394
- Okay. Okay.

528
00:54:22,697 --> 00:54:25,733
Oh, my God, please forgive me?
Please?

529
00:54:32,106 --> 00:54:35,408
Come on, Mitch. Mitch, Mitch,
get up, get up, get up.
Come on, come on.

530
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:37,410
We gotta get outta here.
My family's coming.

531
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:40,313
- Your family?
- The family.
We need to go right now.

532
00:54:40,347 --> 00:54:41,916
- You drugged me.

533
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:46,353
- Fuck the drugs.
- No, I'm not going. Tiana,
I'm not fucking going anywhere!

534
00:54:46,386 --> 00:54:50,024
- I know you have no reason
to trust me.
I really need you to try.

535
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:04,539
- Tiana, stop. What...
What are you doing?

536
00:55:04,572 --> 00:55:06,541
- I'm buying you time.

537
00:55:06,574 --> 00:55:07,975
- Huh?

538
00:55:08,743 --> 00:55:10,545
Hey! Why me?

539
00:55:10,578 --> 00:55:14,081
Tiana, I asked you
a fucking question, huh!
You owe me that at least.

540
00:55:14,115 --> 00:55:15,783
- You're the perfect vessel,
Mitch.

541
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:17,552
- The perfect vessel?

542
00:55:18,786 --> 00:55:20,555
What are you talking about?

543
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,960
<i>My dad is their leader.</i>
<i>They'll stop at nothing.</i>

544
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:28,863
<i>They'll be here any minute.</i>
<i>You have to get outta here.</i>

545
00:55:28,896 --> 00:55:31,098
<i>How could you do this</i>
<i>to me?</i>

546
00:55:33,466 --> 00:55:35,136
<i>And you actually think...</i>

547
00:55:35,169 --> 00:55:37,404
you can resurrect
Charles Manson?

548
00:55:37,939 --> 00:55:39,707
<i>You weren't the first one.</i>

549
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:43,077
The guy in the cage? It was Ben.

550
00:55:44,879 --> 00:55:46,113
Mitch.

551
00:55:47,414 --> 00:55:49,750
Mitch! L-l-leave.

552
00:56:04,632 --> 00:56:06,466
- Was any of it real?

553
00:56:43,738 --> 00:56:45,472
- You killed our son.

554
00:57:27,882 --> 00:57:30,017
- Get up.
- Dad.

555
00:57:30,051 --> 00:57:33,688
Dad, Dad,
I tried to give him the GHB,
but he caught on.

556
00:57:33,721 --> 00:57:37,091
He... he started hitting me
and beating me and, Daddy,

557
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:39,627
he stole the car
and he killed Lucas!

558
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:42,630
- Get up. Get up.
- Dad, I'm sorry!

559
00:57:42,663 --> 00:57:44,265
- Get up.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

560
00:57:44,298 --> 00:57:47,902
I'm sorry about the ritual
and Charlie. I'm sorry...

561
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:51,806
Our son.
You killed my son.

562
00:57:54,108 --> 00:57:55,843
You killed our son.

563
00:58:00,047 --> 00:58:02,917
- Annie.
- You were never meant
to play the part.

564
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:05,519
- Annie, go wait outside.

565
00:58:07,254 --> 00:58:09,657
- ...not told you about the boy?

566
00:58:10,758 --> 00:58:12,727
- Go.
- I told you about the boy.

567
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,528
- Annie.
- I told you about--
- Annie!

568
00:58:14,562 --> 00:58:16,097
- --the boy!

569
00:58:21,736 --> 00:58:22,903
- Go.

570
00:58:23,704 --> 00:58:25,239
Let me do this.

571
00:58:39,253 --> 00:58:41,555
- I love him, Dad.

572
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:43,758
- I know.

573
00:58:44,825 --> 00:58:46,293
I know.

574
00:58:49,864 --> 00:58:51,799
But what about your family?

575
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,535
Our family.

576
00:58:55,302 --> 00:58:58,005
Your brother is gone.

577
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:05,012
My son is dead. My son is dead.

578
00:59:08,249 --> 00:59:10,217
Tonight is the night, Tiana.

579
00:59:11,152 --> 00:59:12,887
Tonight is the night.

580
00:59:15,022 --> 00:59:16,757
Mitch is the vessel.

581
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:27,134
You have committed a horrible,

582
00:59:27,168 --> 00:59:29,770
a horrible sin
against our family.

583
00:59:32,206 --> 00:59:33,841
Against Manson.

584
00:59:36,243 --> 00:59:38,079
Do you understand me?

585
00:59:38,846 --> 00:59:41,649
Look at me.

586
00:59:43,017 --> 00:59:44,852
I've given you too much!

587
00:59:51,225 --> 00:59:52,960
Hope he forgives us.

588
00:59:55,196 --> 00:59:57,698
Pray he forgives us.

589
01:00:00,401 --> 01:00:02,136
You give him a reason to.

590
01:00:39,306 --> 01:00:41,842
- Oh, oh, over here.
What is that?

591
01:00:48,415 --> 01:00:50,050
Call him, Tiana.

592
01:00:50,084 --> 01:00:52,419
- Mitch.
- I said call him loud.

593
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,055
- Mitch, come on!

594
01:00:56,423 --> 01:00:58,325
Mitch, you're safe, baby!

595
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,928
- Again.

596
01:01:00,961 --> 01:01:04,331
- Mitch! I don't know,
he won't fucking listen to me.

597
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:09,370
- You know, Charlie watches,
he sees everything.
You know that, right?

598
01:01:11,172 --> 01:01:12,706
Hey, Mitch!

599
01:01:13,274 --> 01:01:14,742
Come out!

600
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:18,712
Sonofabitch. Gimme that gun.

601
01:01:21,215 --> 01:01:23,817
Hey, Mitch,
I'm gonna give you 10 seconds,

602
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:26,954
then I'm gonna blow
her pretty little head
off her skinny little body.

603
01:01:26,987 --> 01:01:29,356
- Dad--
- Mitch! Shhh.

604
01:01:30,391 --> 01:01:32,026
Don't speak.

605
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,262
- Ten! Nine!

606
01:01:36,497 --> 01:01:39,466
I'm telling you Mitch,
I'm not fucking around!

607
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,035
Eight!

608
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:46,173
Seven!

609
01:01:54,882 --> 01:01:56,417
Oh, fuck it. One!

610
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:59,954
Okay, okay, okay, okay!
- Go get... go get him!
- Oh-ho!

611
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:10,431
Bring him over here.

612
01:02:18,105 --> 01:02:20,274
Now, if you'd just done
your job...

613
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:25,513
- Oh, no, no, no.
What the fuck happened
to this guy, huh?

614
01:02:25,547 --> 01:02:28,849
- Nothing special.
It's just some cuts and bruises.
He'll be fine.

615
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:32,019
You're the one.
You the special boy.

616
01:02:33,354 --> 01:02:35,189
Come on, move.

617
01:03:56,638 --> 01:03:59,541
- Tiana, has he recited
Charlie's will?
- Yes.

618
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:02,142
Yes, yeah.

619
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:05,079
- Three times with vigour?
- Yes, yes.

620
01:04:06,413 --> 01:04:09,049
- Are you sure you're committed
to Charlie's will?

621
01:04:10,351 --> 01:04:11,985
Yes.

622
01:04:17,991 --> 01:04:20,894
- Then I think she's ready
for the mixture.

623
01:04:54,027 --> 01:04:57,498
Shhh. Shhh-shhh-shhh-shhh...

624
01:05:14,415 --> 01:05:16,250
When Charlie wrote this
in prison,

625
01:05:16,283 --> 01:05:20,120
I don't think he had any idea
how dark the world
would become.

626
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:30,063
This X on my forehead
signifies exile.

627
01:05:30,397 --> 01:05:32,132
Charlie was an exile.

628
01:05:35,436 --> 01:05:37,371
We're exiles...

629
01:05:37,404 --> 01:05:39,139
all of us.

630
01:05:44,211 --> 01:05:47,948
Cut off from the circle of life.
But I got good news.

631
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,186
Tonight...

632
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:54,522
on the day
of our lord's departure...

633
01:05:55,623 --> 01:05:58,358
...we are gonna complete
the circle of life.

634
01:06:00,528 --> 01:06:03,665
We are gonna take
a day of sorrow
and turn it into celebration.

635
01:06:05,265 --> 01:06:07,167
Tonight is the night
of resurrection.

636
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:12,039
Tonight we complete the cycle.

637
01:06:19,681 --> 01:06:21,649
Charlie's will is Man's son.

638
01:06:22,216 --> 01:06:24,251
Charlie's will is Man's son.

639
01:06:24,284 --> 01:06:26,053
Charlie's will
is Man's son.

640
01:06:26,086 --> 01:06:28,388
Charlie's will
is Man's son.

641
01:06:28,422 --> 01:06:30,290
Charlie's will is Man's son.

642
01:06:30,324 --> 01:06:32,560
- Charlie's will is Man's son.

643
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:40,000
Bring forth Charlie's ashes.

644
01:07:25,279 --> 01:07:26,814
The mixture's working.

645
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:32,052
Let's cut him down
and put him in the box.

646
01:07:35,657 --> 01:07:38,058
Charlie's coming home tonight.

647
01:08:03,918 --> 01:08:06,554
Tiana... you did it, baby.

648
01:08:08,856 --> 01:08:10,525
You did it.

649
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:19,466
I want you to stand with me,
with us... your family.

650
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:33,648
Tiana.

651
01:08:42,924 --> 01:08:44,491
- Robert.

652
01:08:50,698 --> 01:08:52,132
Robert.

653
01:08:53,735 --> 01:08:55,637
It's happening.

654
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:00,875
It's happening.

655
01:09:01,843 --> 01:09:03,477
It's happening.

656
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:06,413
It's happening.

657
01:09:08,415 --> 01:09:09,917
- Fucking pigs.

658
01:09:13,453 --> 01:09:14,922
Cops!

659
01:09:14,956 --> 01:09:17,558
Boom! Go, get 'em!

660
01:09:17,592 --> 01:09:20,795
- Weapons, weapons, weapons!
- Go, go, go!

661
01:09:22,496 --> 01:09:24,398
- Wake the fuck up!

662
01:09:24,431 --> 01:09:26,266
Fucking pigs.

663
01:09:26,299 --> 01:09:28,770
- Go! Go get him! Go, go, go!

664
01:09:29,937 --> 01:09:32,406
Ah!
- Go, go, go, go!

665
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:34,408
Get off me!

666
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:37,745
Shit, get off me!
- What the fuck, dude?!

667
01:09:37,779 --> 01:09:39,446
Get off him!

668
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:41,649
Please.

669
01:09:55,295 --> 01:09:56,764
Please. Please.

670
01:09:58,432 --> 01:10:00,001
- Tiana!
- Please.

671
01:10:00,034 --> 01:10:01,669
- Mitch?

672
01:10:25,793 --> 01:10:29,697
That's when she, uh,
she fell on the floor and, um...

673
01:10:31,331 --> 01:10:35,368
...and I laughed,
because I thought she was just
kinda feeling it, you know?

674
01:10:36,938 --> 01:10:40,373
And, uh, I lay down next to her,
because, you know,

675
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:43,310
I thought
we were just doing that,
whatever, and she, uh...

676
01:10:44,344 --> 01:10:45,947
And then I just kind of...

677
01:10:46,681 --> 01:10:48,415
I watched her die.

678
01:10:49,717 --> 01:10:51,018
I fucking...

679
01:10:54,321 --> 01:10:56,557
Yeah, I was just...
I was so high,

680
01:10:56,591 --> 01:10:58,860
I thought
it was part of the trip.

681
01:10:59,527 --> 01:11:00,928
And...

682
01:11:03,097 --> 01:11:07,400
...I literally watched her...
choke on the floor
right in front of me.

683
01:11:15,543 --> 01:11:18,378
You know, I just...
I don't think I can...

684
01:11:19,747 --> 01:11:21,616
...go on like this anymore.

685
01:11:23,751 --> 01:11:26,486
I wish it was me instead of her.

686
01:11:30,858 --> 01:11:33,493
Well... that's it.

687
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:39,634
- Nothing's too big
