1
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,596
Come on in, Mr Baker.

2
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,916
As you can see,
I've become quite a fan of yours.

3
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,516
I'm flattered.

4
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,389
Is that why you've asked me to
come down to death row, Mr Strauss?

5
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,156
- To tell me what a fan you are?
- I'd like you to print something.

6
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,196
After all,

7
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,315
you're so good at that.

8
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,196
I'd like you to print

9
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,797
that I said I loved my wife.

10
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,198
- You loved your wife.
- And that I'll love her...

11
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,433
forever.

12
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,274
Of course. Forever. All right.

13
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,596
Thank you, Mr Baker.

14
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,915
Aren't you afraid of dying?

15
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,472
To die is different
from what anyone supposes.

16
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,916
- And luckier.
- That a line from your opera?

17
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,395
It's Walt Whitman.

18
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,234
I can't take credit
for everything, Mr Baker.

19
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,398
You really believe
that you're lucky to die?

20
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,035
What I believe, Mr Baker,

21
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,673
is that this is all far from over.

22
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,156
But you still killed her.
Didn't you, Mr Strauss?

23
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,828
OK, Strauss, let's go.

24
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,595
No! Stop him! Stop him!

25
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,792
Stop him!

26
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,713
These are for you!

27
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,916
You're all right, child.
I'm not going to hurt you.

28
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,550
Here we go. Keep it going!
Keep it going! There!

29
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,958
We found her two nights ago
trying to climb over the gates.

30
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,838
Since then she hasn't
spoken a single word.

31
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:02,153
She won't eat. And when she does
sleep, she has violent nightmares.

32
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,915
- Call the police.
- They've already been here, Father.

33
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,992
They want to take her
to County Hospital.

34
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,117
Last night Sister Constance -
she is in the next room -

35
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,192
she heard the woman call
this word out in her sleep.

36
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,032
- "Die-sher"?
- "Dish-er".

37
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,391
- Sounds like nothing to me.
- Father...

38
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,631
The woman belongs downtown!

39
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,759
Father, every night before bed,
she blocks her door with a chair,

40
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,713
and if you had only heard
this woman scream!

41
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,237
- I don't have to hear her scream.
- I will not abandon her, Father.

42
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,836
She's not spending
another night here and that's final.

43
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,756
But, I see no reason

44
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,594
why we can't have someone look for
her family in the meantime.

45
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,274
But we don't have the money
to hire anybody.

46
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,113
The man I'm thinking of
would do it for nothing.

47
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,829
He grew up here. He was a policeman.

48
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,876
He worked in missing persons
for some time.

49
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,869
How's that for a name you can trust?

50
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,398
Pete? It's Mike.
Don't run the ad. I found Carlisle.

51
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,438
I'm on my way to him right now.

52
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,229
- You're on the wrong side!
- Thanks, pal!

53
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,995
If your wife's cousin calls,

54
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,231
just don't take what she says
too seriously.

55
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,072
Yeah, I took her out.

56
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,392
We went and had some lunch
and we kind of...

57
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,756
We went back to her place and...

58
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,149
No, we're not going out again.

59
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,511
Tell your wife there's nothing
wrong with her cousin,

60
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,955
it's just she...
I don't want to...

61
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,077
I'm not looking for Miss Right.
I'm looking for Miss Right Now.

62
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,912
Thank you.

63
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,797
- Cozy Carlisle?
- Try the freezer.

64
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,836
Thank you.

65
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,191
Fuck you. I'm on a break.

66
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,999
Mr Carlisle,
I've been retained by a law firm

67
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,914
to find you and tell you that
Myron Spargo died last month.

68
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,437
- Who the fuck's Myron Spargo?
- He was a patient of yours.

69
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,159
I had a lot of patients.
Now, beat it.

70
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,038
This one left you $11,000.

71
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,476
- Myron!
- Yeah, Myron.

72
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,996
- Myron T Spargo.
- Plumbing contractor.

73
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,470
Lived in San Marino
with his wife, Karen or Sharon.

74
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,348
Karen.
She must be very lonely right now.

75
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,319
Jesus! 11,000,
that's a lot of grateful.

76
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,516
- You want a cigarette?
- What? No. I don't smoke.

77
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,672
You've looked at this pack
three times in the last minute.

78
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,194
- What?
- You use that pen like a cigarette.

79
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,589
You helped Myron Spargo quit smoking?

80
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,559
No. Myron was impotent. Imagine that.

81
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,076
A man lays pipe for a living,
can't get it up at home.

82
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,559
He had some hard-on
when he made out his will.

83
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,599
Hey, thumb-dick,
I was a damn good shrink.

84
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,196
In 16 years I worked with a
lot of people through a lot of shit.

85
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,716
OK, I slept with a patient or two.

86
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,758
- I still cared about them.
- OK.

87
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,400
I loved being a doctor.

88
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,950
I used to not charge
half my patients.

89
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,275
Then the fucking State comes along,
they send some bitch undercover,

90
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,316
and I'm fucked.

91
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,269
It ain't fair, is it?

92
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,273
Why don't you call Opperman-Crowe?

93
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,400
Set up an appointment,
sign the paperwork,

94
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,199
they'll cut you a cheque
for the 8,800 there.

95
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,033
Excuse me.
What happened to the 11,000?

96
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,236
Well, 11 less my commission.

97
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,632
That is, unless you got a problem
with that, Sigmund.

98
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,637
Could I use your phone?

99
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,109
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.

100
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,317
- Mr Church?
- Yeah?

101
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,717
Someone's either a smoker or a
nonsmoker, there's no in-between.

102
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,909
The trick is to find out
which one you are and be that.

103
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,437
- Well, I'm trying to quit.
- Don't tell me you're trying.

104
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,671
People who say that are pussies
who cannot commit.

105
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,752
Find out which one you are.
Be that. That's it.

106
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,479
If you're a nonsmoker, you'll know.

107
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,028
Thank you. Nice place you got here.

108
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,872
Fuckin' fruitcake.

109
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,238
Somewhere someone is very worried
about this woman.

110
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,036
All right. I'll give her a lift
to County Hospital.

111
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,032
That's really all I got time to do
right now.

112
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,155
Maybe on the way I'll stop and have a
buddy of mine at the paper

113
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,516
take her picture,
run it in the morning edition.

114
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,071
- How's that sound?
- That sounds wonderful. Thank you.

115
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,310
That sounds wonderful. All right.

116
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,594
So only one glove, one ring...

117
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,196
I was checking the labels to get a
line on where she bought them.

118
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,795
And how did the labels
smell, Mr Church?

119
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,836
Expensive.

120
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,311
Perfume. I mean...

121
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,356
Mike Church.

122
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,958
This is a Claddagh ring,
lrish wedding band.

123
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,191
If you wear it with the crown up,
it means you're taken.

124
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,113
Crown down, you're not.
How were you wearing it?

125
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,590
The policeman had her take it off
so he could see it.

126
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,989
What about the other glove?

127
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,390
She only had the one on
when we found her.

128
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,511
I'll help her get ready.

129
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,433
If you see anything
you recognise, holler.

130
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,715
I know you can't holler per se,

131
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,112
so maybe just you give
a wave or something.

132
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,029
It sure is nice to be with someone

133
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,111
you don't feel you have
to yak to all the time.

134
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,072
Smile, sweetheart. That's a girl!

135
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,758
You're really just going to
dump her off at County?

136
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,071
- Why don't you take her home?
- She's not a stray dog, Pete.

137
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,277
Besides, you never
bring women back to your place.

138
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,591
They might mess with your stuff.
"Oh, my stuff!"

139
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,754
At least you won't forget her name.
She's already forgotten it for you.

140
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,990
Count to 30, take her out
of the fixer, put her in the water.

141
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,356
I'll be writing the caption.
Let's start.

142
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,672
- Thank you so much.
- You're in good hands, sweetheart.

143
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,309
Mikey's a pro. He can find anything.

144
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,118
Same thing happened to me once.
Two years ago.

145
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,112
This mailman in Lawndale freaked out,
chopped up his family with a trimmer.

146
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,716
Then either cos he heard a voice
or maybe he felt bad,

147
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,234
- he cut off his own arms.
- Pete.

148
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,471
- Had to dial 911 with his nose.
- Pete!

149
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,438
- What?
- I know there's a point to this.

150
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,036
It's coming! I was the first shooter
to show up at the scene.

151
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,079
I take one look, I pass out.
I passed out cold.

152
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,998
I come to, I had no idea who I was.
I didn't even know my own family.

153
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,958
It was the scariest thing
that ever happened to me.

154
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,190
Then one morning I wake up

155
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,511
and my little girl is
standing beside the bed.

156
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,070
And she looks at me and says,
"I love you."

157
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,913
I just looked at her
and in about two seconds

158
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,395
my whole life came back to me.

159
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,793
So, you hang in there, sweetheart.

160
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,238
Sooner or later, it'll all come back.
Scout's honour.

161
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,154
I got to get her to the hospital.

162
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,071
I got this thing to write.

163
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,754
- Thank you.
- Sure.

164
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,158
My name and number
are going to be in the paper,

165
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,472
so when somebody sees your picture,
I'll come get you.

166
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,359
We're talking one night
at the most here.

167
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,116
That's my fucking cookie, bitch!
That's my cookie!

168
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,758
Give it to me! Give it to me!

169
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,515
- It's not my problem!
- Take her to the hospital.

170
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,388
- I took her. It was terrible.
- We cannot deal with her.

171
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,392
I'm sure you'll find this place
almost as nice as County Hospital.

172
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,113
My goodness!
The maid hasn't been.

173
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,636
I'm sure you won't be stuck here
too long.

174
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,269
This place was spotless
when I left it a year ago.

175
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,070
Somebody's going to see
your picture in the paper and

176
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,316
they'll come find you
and you'll know what your name is.

177
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,159
It's OK.
Can I get rid of this for you?

178
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,800
Relieve you of hospital life.
Are you faint?

179
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,952
You're hungry, right?
You haven't eaten all day.

180
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,877
If you get hungry,
the fridge is there.

181
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,672
Trudy, it's 10:00, for Christ's sake!
Will you shut up?

182
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,071
We're friends. Music, I love it.
But her music? No.

183
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,350
The bedroom's in here.

184
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,590
The bathroom's here.
The closet's there.

185
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,274
There's a sweatshirt
in the bottom drawer,

186
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,193
in case you want
something to sleep in,

187
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,670
and some old clothes
if you want to change in the morning.

188
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,955
Help yourself.

189
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,837
That's a beauty, isn't it?

190
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,879
The desk and bookcase in there
are from the same period.

191
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,916
Good night.

192
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,076
Welcome to...

193
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,511
"The desk and bookshelf in there
are from the same period."

194
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,556
What an asshole!

195
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,596
These are for you.

196
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,437
What's going on? Open the door!

197
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,956
Take it easy.

198
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,629
You're OK. It's OK. Take it easy.

199
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,031
I'm not telling you anything.
You tell me what her ring looks like.

200
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,076
A coiled serpent.

201
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,558
Skull and crossbones? Yeah?

202
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,351
Matches the tattoo?
Thanks for calling, Floyd.

203
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,069
The entire male
population of LA's checked in.

204
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,116
This is better than video dating.

205
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,715
- Excuse me, Mr Church?
- Yeah. Can I help you?

206
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,916
Actually, I'm here to help you.

207
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,673
Who are you supposed
to be, her grandfather?

208
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,673
Not her grandfather,
nor her grandmother, for that matter.

209
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,833
In fact, I'm no relation at all.
My name is Franklyn Madson.

210
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,596
That's a very handsome chair.
That's a Heywood-Wakefield.

211
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,750
I'll give you $45 for that right now.

212
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,752
It's a Stickley, worth $250.
What can I do for you?

213
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,229
A glass of water would be lovely.

214
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,871
Your stairs are rather steep.
The long climb's worn me out a bit.

215
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,993
I see cases like this all the time.

216
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,751
A person experiences a trauma

217
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,513
and they want to erase it
from their minds.

218
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,831
The trouble is, they erase
everything else along with it.

219
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,239
- You a shrink?
- No, not exactly.

220
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,675
I'm a hypnotist.

221
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,673
Here's the water, there's
the door. Sorry about the stairs.

222
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,872
Tastes a bit like bourbon.

223
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,956
It's simply a matter of regressing
the young lady back to a happier time

224
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,952
and then asking her who she is.

225
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,431
Your hand is feeling
very light, my dear,

226
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,593
so light that I'm afraid
if I were to let go of it,

227
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,274
it would just float up,
all on its own.

228
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,919
- Who gave you permission?
- No.

229
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,471
She's perfectly all right.
Continue to relax, my dear.

230
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,838
Tell yourself
you're going deeper and deeper

231
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,629
into a state of hypnosis. That's it.

232
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,279
That's right.

233
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,636
That's very nice.

234
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,472
Good.

235
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,431
My dear, let us go back.

236
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,038
Tell me, has something...

237
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,111
Somebody help me!

238
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,034
- Is she still under?
- No.

239
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,433
What made you scream?
Can you talk now?

240
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,432
At least we know she does talk.
Rather well, in fact.

241
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,476
How do you feel?

242
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,956
I'd say she was feeling better.
Splendid.

243
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:53,233
You could come by my shop tomorrow
afternoon and we can try again.

244
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,199
I shall need several hours
but the surroundings there will be...

245
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,273
You did great, she spoke,
but I don't have the money...

246
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,193
No. It will cost you nothing,
Mr Church.

247
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,919
We'll deal with her family
when we find them.

248
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,913
I'm sure they'll find my services
invaluable

249
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,516
once they realise I'm the one
who's reunited them with their...

250
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,034
daughter, wife, or whomever.

251
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,877
You have some lovely things. Pity...

252
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,516
I bid you all good day.

253
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,349
You missed something around the back.
Do you want to put your head down?

254
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,716
I'll get you a towel.

255
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,192
Madson?

256
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,353
You were inside
President Roosevelt's office?

257
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,756
Yes, lots of times.

258
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,388
My mommy was his cook.

259
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,153
We were like family.

260
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,315
I used to sit on Uncle Teddy's lap.

261
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,113
- I liked that.
- I'm sure Uncle Teddy did, too.

262
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,913
Mrs Tepper,
on the south wall of that office,

263
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,434
there was a lacquered mahogany desk.

264
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,830
Yes, I remember.

265
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,876
What did President...?

266
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:19,189
What did Uncle Teddy do with it?

267
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:28,230
He gave it to Emily Maxwell,
his personal secretary.

268
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,872
- Where did Mrs Maxwell retire to?
- Tucson, Arizona.

269
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,076
I'm going to count to three,

270
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,755
at which point you'll be wide awake,
quite refreshed,

271
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,031
and you'll remember nothing
of our little discussion.

272
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,588
One, two, three.

273
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,872
How did I do?

274
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,556
I don't think you'll need to worry
about those silly chocolate cravings.

275
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,592
Mother, turn that down, please.

276
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:28,519
I thought today,
since this is our first real session,

277
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,073
we'd just go for an hour or two.

278
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,989
As soon as you feel
quite comfortable, my dear,

279
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,870
I want you to take a look
at the candle in front of you.

280
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,390
I want you to stare at it. Good.

281
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,353
I want you to picture yourself
walking down a flight of stairs.

282
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,115
With each step,
you'll relax still further.

283
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,796
And as you go down,

284
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,189
I want you to tell yourself,

285
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,113
"I am going deeper and deeper

286
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,951
into a state of hypnosis."

287
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,997
Since yesterday
you became a bit excited,

288
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,915
today I want you to distance yourself
from the events you're watching,

289
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,393
as if you were only a witness,
not an actual participant.

290
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,275
If you do happen to notice
any nice little relics

291
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,433
or objets d'art along the way,
you might just mention them, too.

292
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,476
For Christ's sakes.

293
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,512
At the bottom of the stairs,
I want you to picture a door.

294
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,352
This door is very important,

295
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,877
because just beyond it lies
whatever time or place

296
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,633
from your life you wish to visit.

297
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,508
All right, the door has opened.

298
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,755
You can speak, my dear.
What was the happiest day...?

299
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,038
- The day we first met.
- Distance yourself.

300
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,395
The day Roman and Margaret first met.

301
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,717
Margaret?

302
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,756
- That's right.
- Margaret who?

303
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,276
- Mr Church...
- Strauss.

304
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,235
All right, let's go back to the day
Margaret and Roman first met.

305
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,196
How far back are you? Two years?

306
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,636
Three years? A year?

307
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,837
It was 1948.

308
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,670
I think I've heard enough.

309
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,753
Mr Church, I really must insist
that you refrain from talking.

310
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,310
The lady just told us she met a guy
named Roman in 1948.

311
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,279
- I say the session's over.
- On occasion, Mr Church,

312
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,115
hypnosis can take us back to our past
lives as well as our past.

313
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,156
You expect me just to run with that?

314
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,155
Let me remind you, yesterday
this young lady wasn't even speaking.

315
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,513
Rachmaninoff was
on the program that night.

316
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,036
Wait for me, my dear.

317
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,556
When was this?

318
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,792
Winter 1948.

319
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,234
Roman was guest conductor
with the Los Angeles Symphony.

320
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,194
Everyone was terrified of him,

321
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,315
except Margaret.

322
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,430
It was after the war,

323
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,991
and Los Angeles was so exciting.

324
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,312
Everywhere you went,
people were having fun.

325
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,876
I'm sorry.

326
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,749
To Margaret, a woman
with more beauty than grace.

327
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,592
Thank you very much.

328
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,591
Roman could dance.

329
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,870
He could tell jokes.

330
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,077
He could even read palms.

331
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,312
Not much of a life line, I'm afraid.

332
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,199
But wait. I do see love.

333
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,310
Passionate, everlasting, love.

334
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,675
- Does this work on a lot of women?
- I'll let you know.

335
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,872
Margaret's career was flourishing,

336
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,555
and Roman was confident
that his new opera

337
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,111
would make him as famous in America
as he had been in Europe.

338
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,151
I heard you were once married.

339
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,994
Yes, I was. She's dead now.

340
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,876
How did she die?

341
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,829
To escape Germany,
we had to go through the mountains.

342
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:57,678
It was a very difficult trip,
and she had a weak heart.

343
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,877
Roman lived in this enormous house.

344
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,870
Just him, his housekeeper
and her son.

345
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,396
And Roman's music.

346
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,279
It's for an opera I'm working on.

347
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,794
You're writing an opera
about a monster?

348
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,839
- Is this from your opera?
- Yes.

349
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,756
The opera was almost
all Roman cared about,

350
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,755
until he met Margaret and literally
swept her off her feet.

351
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,038
I'm drenched. We'll ruin this couch.

352
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,270
I'll get another one.

353
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,753
The day of the wedding was so happy.

354
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,437
It seemed like nothing and nobody
could ever come between them.

355
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,911
Daytime.

356
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,235
First step's always the toughest.
Sweetheart, thank you.

357
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,390
Help. Where are we?

358
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,119
Don't ask. Just try to be polite.

359
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,391
Easy, boys, the war is over.

360
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,311
- Lydia.
- Otto!

361
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,516
- So nice to see you.
- So nice to see you.

362
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,114
May I present Gray Baker?

363
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,834
- I'm yawning already.
- We'll stay five minutes.

364
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,071
- Nice to see you.
- Gray Baker. Congratulations.

365
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,035
Inga, I was just upstairs.

366
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,317
- Yes?
- It's just that I thought...

367
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,188
We had talked about you and Frankie
moving downstairs.

368
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,113
Roman never said anything to me.

369
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,357
What Mr Strauss said or didn't say
is irrelevant.

370
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,750
We've already discussed this.
Tonight, of all nights,

371
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,310
I'd appreciate it if you weren't
sleeping in the next room.

372
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,632
- Yes, Mrs Strauss.
- Thank you.

373
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,790
Mrs Strauss?

374
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,392
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Frankie.

375
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,634
- Lydia.
- Mrs Strauss.

376
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,270
May I present Gray Baker?

377
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,590
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

378
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,831
Mr Bakerjust made the list
for the Pulitzer Prize.

379
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,638
Really?

380
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,314
- Yes, really.
- Well, congratulations.

381
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,472
- Congratulations yourself.
- Thank you.

382
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,630
So, any new tidbits from the press?

383
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,598
Zero. To tell you the truth,
I miss the war.

384
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,870
What an odd thing to say.

385
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,910
Doesn't seem to be much news any
more, all this back-to-normal stuff.

386
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,677
The world's getting boring again.

387
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,990
I'll tell you what,
the only thing I do regret

388
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,596
is by being away so long
I haven't had my chance...

389
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,759
to hear you play, Mrs Strauss.
To hear you play.

390
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,994
I'm not going into hiding, Mr Baker.
I'm just getting married.

391
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,958
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- The pleasure's mine.

392
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,914
See you later. Bye.

393
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,952
Roman had given Margaret
the wedding day of her dreams,

394
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,711
full of new people
and wonderful surprises.

395
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,152
But there was
another surprise to come.

396
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,312
Roman.

397
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,189
I've never seen anything like this.

398
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,715
It's beautiful.
I don't know what to say.

399
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,879
- "Thank you" is always good.
- Thank you.

400
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,596
No, it's not a bracelet, darling.

401
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,514
It's an anklet,
a very special anklet.

402
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,556
Let's have your leg.

403
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:56,840
It's very old. The man
I bought it from explained to me

404
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,798
that when a husband gives this
to his wife,

405
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,953
they become...

406
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,549
two halves of the same person.

407
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,236
Nothing can separate them.

408
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,196
Not even death.

409
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,675
So we're stuck with each other.

410
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,594
Either that, or I've
overpaid terribly for the thing.

411
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,354
Three, two, one.

412
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,436
A little hot in here.

413
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,956
Mother, could you open
a window for us, please?

414
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,358
This isn't as uncommon
as you might think.

415
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,556
A colleague in San Francisco...

416
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,234
May I have a glass of water?

417
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,952
You really have found your tongue.
Wonderful.

418
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,349
- Do you know your name?
- Give her time.

419
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,477
Do you remember anything
about the people you talked about?

420
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,711
- Are they still alive?
- I'd like to show you something.

421
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,635
June 1949.

422
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,955
That was Roman Strauss,
that was his wife Margaret,

423
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,429
and that was their home.

424
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,432
Handsome man, wasn't he? Not at all
the sort who'd murder his wife.

425
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,794
Yes. He stabbed her in the throat

426
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,998
with a lovely pair of antique
Die Schere barber scissors.

427
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,674
Die Schere... Disher.

428
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,639
They were auctioned at Christie's
last year for 20,000

429
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,034
by a Japanese gentleman,
if memory serves.

430
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,916
They seemed so in love.

431
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,072
They're usually the people
that kill each other.

432
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,311
Could she have dreamed this
or read about them?

433
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,712
No. I got clarity far beyond what one
would pick up from reading.

434
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,918
- They look alike. It means nothing.
- Mr Church.

435
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,118
- I don't believe she was there.
- It doesn't matter.

436
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,670
For whatever reason,
these events are consuming her.

437
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,117
The sooner we work through them, the
sooner she'll get her memory back.

438
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,432
Tomorrow I have a Friar's luncheon
at twelve.

439
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,957
- How's 4:00 tomorrow sound?
- Yes. Thank you very much.

440
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,395
My pleasure.

441
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,192
- Mr Church.
- Yeah?

442
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,114
The magazine. It's $17.95.

443
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,109
You OK? ls there anything
you need right now?

444
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,156
You mean besides my memory?

445
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,429
OK. I can't get used
to the sound of your voice.

446
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,274
It's like one day you wake up
and your cat talks to you.

447
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,672
It's just you've been so quiet
the last couple of days and...

448
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,150
Never mind.
I didn't speak. Forget it.

449
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,556
Mr Church.

450
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,840
- Mike.
- Why are you helping me?

451
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,876
I don't know. You smell good.

452
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,952
Maybe I feel sorry for you.
Maybe I like you.

453
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,350
Maybe I just want to hear
how that story you told ends.

454
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,273
But you don't believe any of that.

455
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,033
I believe you experienced
something weird.

456
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,634
I'm not convinced it means
what he says.

457
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,269
- You think I'm crazy?
- I think we need a second opinion.

458
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,678
- What do you think happened?
- Sounds like a past-life experience.

459
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,512
You said you were good.

460
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,512
I used to think it was bullshit,
but it happens.

461
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,273
I had this one crazy old lady.
Really batshit.

462
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,989
She was so claustrophobic
she'd choke in Yankee Stadium.

463
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,119
I thought, you know
what I'm dealing with here?

464
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,795
Maybe some childhood trauma.
I'll use hypnotherapy.

465
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,553
I'll find some memory.
I'll regress her.

466
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,029
Sure enough. Bingo!

467
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,475
There it was.
She was five years old.

468
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,916
She had this uncle who'd molest her
in the closet.

469
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,754
Really sick shit.
I thought, "I got it!" No.

470
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,877
A couple more months,
she's still claustrophobic.

471
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,509
I said, what the fuck!
I'll regress her back even further.

472
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,556
This time when I ask her the year,

473
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,393
- she says 1832.
- 1832?

474
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,438
When I hear that,
I say, "Right, lady. Blow me."

475
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,877
But she keeps going. She says there's
this father who's an undertaker.

476
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,111
She has a brother
who liked to lock her in coffins.

477
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,715
I don't know if it was bullshit
or if it wasn't.

478
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:23,033
All I know is after that session,
she wasn't claustrophobic any more.

479
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,271
A lot more people believe in
past lives than don't.

480
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,828
I'm sure that makes her
feel a lot better.

481
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,516
This lady screams in her sleep today,
right now. I don't care who she was.

482
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,989
I want to know who she is.

483
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,159
Do you believe what you saw was real?

484
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,516
It seemed real. Yeah.

485
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,068
Stick with the junk man.
He's on the right track.

486
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,310
- I'll tell you why.
- Look...

487
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,715
Sometimes a trauma in a present life

488
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,678
can lead you back
to a trauma in a past life.

489
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,035
If you resolve that past-life trauma,

490
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,998
you got a good chance
of finding out who you are.

491
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,278
You take knowledge from this life,
use it in the next. That's karma.

492
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,557
Isn't it I do something bad now,
I'm a termite next time?

493
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,760
You ask me, you're already a termite
in this life in a shitty suit, OK?

494
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,992
What good is learning if you'll be
with different people each time?

495
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,548
You won't be with different people.

496
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,871
Thanks to fate, the cosmic force
with a tragic sense of humour,

497
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,192
you burn somebody in one life,
they get to burn you in this one.

498
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,637
It's the karma credit plan.
Buy now, pay forever.

499
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,071
Excuse me. It's my karmic burden
to load some cat food.

500
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,157
Come on.

501
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,395
Tell me something, Mike.

502
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,357
Why is it that I can recognise
certain smells,

503
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,477
that I know my right hand
from my left,

504
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,472
but I can't remember
what my favourite colour is

505
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:12,680
or my favourite flower
or what kind of wine I like.

506
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,276
- Maybe you're lucky.
- How so?

507
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:19,751
There must be a certain freedom
living only in the present.

508
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,118
At least you don't have to spend
every day trying to forget your past.

509
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,236
Excuse me.

510
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,829
So Roman's guard on death row
wrote this?

511
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,911
This is the press coverage?

512
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,549
I spent three hours in the file
morgue looking for that stuff.

513
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,189
How's it going with Jane Doe?
Getting anywhere? Trying to?

514
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,510
Gray Baker.
She mentioned him today.

515
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,479
- You think she's married?
- He wrote every single one of these?

516
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,791
- I've known her two days.
- Sometimes that's all it takes.

517
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,236
- Think Baker's still around?
- He'd be a million years old.

518
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,629
I notice you're staying in tonight.

519
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,271
Why don't you find someone from that
paper who knows what happened to him.

520
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,476
Shut up.

521
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,270
- Hello, Pete.
- You're talking!

522
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,389
Yeah. I hope it's OK,
I borrowed more clothes.

523
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,432
Sure, fine.

524
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,117
Don't worry.
I didn't mess with your stuff.

525
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,551
I like your voice.

526
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,028
I like being able to finally use it.

527
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,076
You don't want to be late.

528
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,116
- For what?
- For whatever.

529
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,150
- Right. She's living here?
- Let me know when you find Baker.

530
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,390
Need some? I got one in my wallet.

531
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,918
It was really nice of you
to eat the whole dinner.

532
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,834
- No. It was really good.
- I don't have company that often.

533
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,913
You'll love this. We can have
a few drinks, maybe dance off dinner.

534
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,798
I know the owner.
He'll take good care of us.

535
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,756
Ray, how you doing?

536
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,794
We're closed, Mike.
It's going to rain.

537
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,917
- You're kidding. No music tonight?
- Al's sick.

538
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,313
I'm trying to have
a romantic evening.

539
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,550
You want to get her drunk?

540
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,238
Two glasses of wine.
We'll sit outside. You can leave.

541
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,390
- We lost our liquor licence.
- No.

542
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,029
- The neighbours.
- How about some coffee?

543
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,156
I got tea.

544
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,277
- Tea is fine.
- Tea is fine.

545
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,158
What the hell
happened to this place?

546
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,357
I can't believe there's no booze.
What's going on?

547
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,269
Is this from your opera?

548
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,272
Father Tim made us take piano
lessons. He said it was therapeutic.

549
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,158
Tea's up. Jesus! I'm sorry.

550
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,596
Let's see how else
I can screw up this evening.

551
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,636
- It's OK.
- You OK?

552
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,950
It's OK.

553
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,110
- It's OK.
- OK.

554
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:02,472
- Cold?
- No, I'm not cold.

555
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,036
I'm just scared.

556
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,037
- Of what?
- I don't know.

557
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,430
It's like...

558
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,557
someone's following me.

559
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:22,150
And I can't see who it is.

560
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,514
I can't...

561
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,630
see behind me.

562
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,315
But you will. It takes time.

563
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,391
Mike, someone wants to kill me.

564
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,189
Those are just dreams.
They're not real.

565
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,078
Nobody is going to hurt you now.

566
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,273
When you know who you are,
you're not going to be so afraid.

567
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,874
If it makes you feel any better,
I can read tea bags.

568
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:59,159
- You're gonna tell me my future?
- I'm going to tell you your past.

569
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,315
Let's see. You were born in ldaho.
Your father was a potato farmer.

570
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,597
You tell jokes real well.
You're a great cook.

571
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,719
You never get seasick, except maybe
that one time on your honeymoon.

572
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,552
I'm married?

573
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,870
To Jim Tannenbaum, the Potato Prince.

574
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,952
The Potato Prince? So I'm rich?

575
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,759
No, but you have each other,
so it doesn't matter.

576
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,957
Your favourite colour's red.
Favourite flowers are roses.

577
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,996
How did I lose my memory?

578
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,311
Once a month, you take
six homeless women bungee jumping

579
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,073
off the Cal Fed building
on Miracle Mile.

580
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:42,439
Last week, you bumped your head and
wandered around the Wilshire district

581
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,511
until you ended up at St Audrey's.

582
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,558
- Bungee jumping?
- You're a thrill seeker.

583
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,596
What's my name?

584
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,112
Grace.

585
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,637
Grace.

586
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,477
That's what the tea bag says,
that my name is Grace.

587
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,870
I had this kindergarten teacher,
Sister Grace.

588
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,394
You remind me of her.

589
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,754
Would this be the
big, fat sister Grace?

590
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,991
No, this would be the

591
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:20,598
big, beautiful, Sister Grace.

592
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:29,152
OK. Grace it is.

593
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,834
OK. To Grace.

594
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,237
Mike, why is it
Father Timothy asked you to help me?

595
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,915
I owe Tim a lot of favours.
I was not the greatest kid.

596
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,037
I always had this kind of temper.

597
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,829
I used to beat up on the other kids.
He straightened me out.

598
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:58,278
In fact, if it wasn't for him,
I'd be in some jail somewhere.

599
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:02,558
Don't you think it's strange we both
just showed up at St Audrey's?

600
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,428
Not strange. Just one of those
things. It's coincidence.

601
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,876
I wonder.

602
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,710
You wonder what?

603
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,038
I wonder how
the Potato Prince would feel

604
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,237
about us walking together
around a moonlit lake.

605
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,357
I'm sure he's a very
understanding guy.

606
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,958
Then again,
maybe there is no Potato Prince.

607
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,996
Maybe not.

608
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,834
- It's sprinkling.
- That's nothing.

609
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,912
- Do you remember how to dance?
- I don't know.

610
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,833
- Let's go up to my roof and see.
- Your roof?

611
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,390
It's where I take all the women
I date with no memory.

612
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,711
- It's going to rain.
- It never rains in LA.

613
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,316
I think it is going to rain.

614
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,190
- We'll ruin it.
- It's already ruined.

615
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,748
This is what happened
with Roman and Margaret.

616
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,796
I'm not Roman.

617
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,392
We can always go back inside.

618
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,789
No, I'm hungry.
Let's go someplace, see what I like.

619
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,394
Maybe Syd would give you
your old table back.

620
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,277
Kathryn?

621
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,555
Kathryn!

622
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,870
Thank God, you're all right.

623
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,195
- You don't recognise me, do you?
- No.

624
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,396
In a few days, it'll all come back.

625
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,870
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm sorry. Doug O'Malley.

626
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,996
- So?
- This is my fiancée.

627
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,792
When I got home and
you weren't there, I went crazy.

628
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,155
Then I saw your picture in the paper.

629
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,199
- Why doesn't she recognise you?
- It must be the Dalmane.

630
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,512
- The what?
- Dalmane. It's for insomnia.

631
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,831
- "Kathryn Pierce"?
- Sometimes it causes memory lapse.

632
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,388
- Are those his?
- This has happened before?

633
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,155
Once when she took too much,
but I was around that time.

634
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,437
- Whose clothes are these?
- Where were you this time?

635
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,513
- I had a job interview back east.
- What kind of ring does she wear?

636
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,752
It's an lrish wedding band.
I gave it to her in high school.

637
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,871
I'm still going to need
a little more.

638
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,919
I found this near the front door.
You must have dropped it.

639
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,873
- Why can't I remember you?
- You will. I swear you will.

640
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,512
I promise.

641
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,033
Is there some sort of fee
involved here?

642
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,076
Forget it.

643
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,314
You should get something
for your trouble.

644
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,995
- Let me pay for your expenses.
- Just...

645
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,876
Just take good care of her.

646
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,599
I don't know what...

647
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,910
Thank you for everything, Mr Church.

648
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,916
Have a nice life.

649
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,353
The car's up here.
We'll go straight to the doctor.

650
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,396
I got your other glove.

651
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,549
Man, you were this close.

652
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,359
This glove thing was a nice touch.

653
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,431
I don't know what you mean.

654
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,751
There's only one
teeny little problem.

655
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,995
It's for the wrong hand, Doug.

656
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,276
Son of a bitch!

657
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,876
You son of a...

658
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,877
That fucking guy
look like he knew karate to you?

659
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,757
I really believed him. Who was he?

660
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,796
You got people chasing you
in every life.

661
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,075
The sooner we find out
who you are, the better.

662
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,955
In light of today's events,

663
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,997
I think we should
move along a little faster.

664
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,993
Therefore, my dear,
I want you to think about

665
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:02,757
when things started to turn sour
for Roman and Margaret.

666
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:07,072
All right, then? The door has opened.

667
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,790
It all started
the night of Otto Kline's party.

668
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,996
It was one of Otto's
weird costume things.

669
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,275
Roman didn't want to go.

670
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,557
Margaret was convinced
that something was wrong,

671
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,432
but Roman would only say
that things were wonderful.

672
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:40,832
Welcome, my dear friends.
Let the party begin!

673
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,999
Margaret, darling! Margaret, hello!

674
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:56,039
- You look so lovely.
- You look stunning, beautiful.

675
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,635
Strauss, you old Kraut.
There you are.

676
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,439
- How are you?
- Excuse me.

677
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,159
Of course, I love what you do.

678
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,555
- Otto, I love your costume!
- What luck I have.

679
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:15,031
- May I have a word in private?
- Sure. What's on your mind?

680
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,634
- I need some money.
- You?

681
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,233
- I'm offering you a job.
- I can't write music for the movies.

682
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,676
I tried it once. You yourself said
it wasn't any good.

683
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,150
No. I told you it was too good
for the damn picture.

684
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,835
It doesn't matter. I've turned
the library into a music room.

685
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,037
If I can just finish this opera,
I know things will change.

686
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,112
- There you are, you naughty boy.
- Darling!

687
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,789
- Mission dry, please.
- What a coincidence.

688
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,113
Mr Baker.

689
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,873
- Mrs Strauss.
- How are you?

690
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,032
- Still miss the war?
- Matter of fact, I do.

691
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,718
- Thank you.
- To friendship.

692
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,838
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

693
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,792
- Is it really good to smoke so much?
- No.

694
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,793
That's why I started rolling my own.
Figured it will slow me down.

695
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,634
- Has it?
- No. I just roll them faster.

696
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,394
- You look like you're somebody.
- Do l?

697
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,675
- You in the business?
- The business?

698
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,036
- You know, pictures, movies.
- No. I'm a composer.

699
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,714
In that case, you're not anybody.

700
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,276
It's cold.
I think we should go inside.

701
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,754
How are things at home, Margaret?

702
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,035
Writing gossip these days, Mr Baker?

703
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:10,317
You meet someone on their
wedding day, it's been a while,

704
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,073
it's natural to inquire
how things are going.

705
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,197
- Especially if you're a reporter.
- Especially.

706
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:19,238
- How are things?
- Fine. Wonderful.

707
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,392
- Go inside, everyone.
- This cutting cold!

708
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,950
Make yourself comfortable.
Roman, it's freezing out there.

709
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:38,116
- I could be a good friend, Margaret.
- What makes you such a good friend?

710
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,592
I can talk baseball to a man

711
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,673
and pay a stupid compliment
to a woman, what else is there?

712
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:49,154
Who's going to win
the series this year?

713
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,712
Very nice.

714
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,235
Impressive piece ofjewellery.

715
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:02,835
May I get close to it?

716
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,479
Yes.

717
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,309
This must be worth a fortune.

718
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,996
Yes, it is.

719
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:25,510
I know I shouldn't say this,
but the first time I saw you...

720
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:30,908
- Hello, Margaret.
- Roman. Where have you been?

721
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,434
Inside with everyone else.

722
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,512
How are you, Mr Strauss?

723
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,353
I'm curious what you were
doing with my wife's leg.

724
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,635
- I was only trying...
- Really, Roman.

725
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:47,032
- Mr Baker's just a friend.
- This man is no friend of yours.

726
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,999
This is none of my business
but Margaret just needed somebody...

727
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,831
Roman!

728
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,519
- Where do you get such ideas?
- I don't know.

729
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,955
Maybe when I saw him
holding your leg.

730
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:09,272
He was looking at the anklet
you specifically asked me to wear

731
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,477
so everybody could see
how rich we are, or were.

732
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,791
- So you told him we're broke?
- I didn't say anything.

733
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,711
No, you just lifted up your dress!

734
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,916
Is everything all right,
Mr Strauss?

735
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:24,150
Yes. Everything is fine.

736
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,114
I may not be
as successful as Gray Baker...

737
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:37,558
I don't care about Gray Baker!
You can be so stupid sometimes.

738
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:52,032
What happened to the man who said
that nothing could separate us.

739
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,758
That we're two halves
of the same person?

740
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:00,552
He became a nobody.

741
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,549
Only in his eyes.

742
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,595
You're not a nobody, Roman.

743
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,716
And you're my husband.

744
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,796
I love you.

745
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,392
No, no...

746
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,438
- No!
- Mr Strauss?

747
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:00,877
- Yes, Frankie?
- The phone rang. Mother answered.

748
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,750
I'm not sure,
but I think it's for you.

749
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,756
Thank you, Frankie.

750
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,992
I called to apologise
about the other night.

751
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:25,437
Not at all. I'm hoping
that we can all forget what happened.

752
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:30,640
Margaret, I think there's some things
you should know about Roman's money.

753
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:38,517
- Who was on the phone earlier?
- Just an old friend.

754
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,756
The flute player.

755
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,032
Oboe.

756
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,036
How is he?

757
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,076
She's fine.

758
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,152
Good.

759
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,836
What are you doing?

760
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,835
I was giving you this.

761
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,071
It's a charm for good luck.

762
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:36,472
Frankie, do you know what happened
to my pearl earrings?

763
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,518
No, I don't.

764
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,591
They were in this drawer last night.

765
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:46,117
I wouldn't steal anything from you,
Mrs Strauss.

766
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:52,036
I don't have to.
Roman is very good to us.

767
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,952
You're overreacting.

768
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,235
I caught him
with his hand in my drawer.

769
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:21,598
He was giving you a charm.
They're like that, superstitious.

770
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,832
- I want you to fire them.
- I can't fire them.

771
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,718
- They've been with me for years.
- That's no reason...

772
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,633
- They saved my life.
- What are you talking about?

773
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,075
They got me out of Germany.

774
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,312
After my wife died, I became ill.

775
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,473
Frankie and lnga risked their
own lives by remaining with me.

776
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:46,553
They made many sacrifices. They...

777
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,950
You can't ask me to
fire these people, Margaret.

778
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:55,192
Why have you never told me you got
all your money from your first wife?

779
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,957
Because it isn't true. Who...?

780
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:01,396
Why would a woman with a bad heart
travel over mountains?

781
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,553
We had no choice. It would have
been worse had we stayed.

782
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:12,192
Have I answered all
of Mr Baker's questions?

783
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,599
He's been feeding you
this nonsense, hasn't he?

784
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,752
What is it between you and Mr Baker?

785
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:23,116
- Roman, don't start this.
- Where do you two meet?

786
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,236
Don't you walk away from me!

787
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,391
Wake up, sweetheart.

788
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:36,393
- Roman?
- No. These are for you.

789
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:47,795
- You were in the house.
- What house?

790
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:51,711
Roman and Margaret's house.

791
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,633
You saw Mr Church in the past?

792
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,280
He had a pair of scissors.

793
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,556
He was going to kill me.

794
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,792
- Come on.
- This means that you're finally...

795
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,030
coming into the present.

796
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:13,956
- I'm on her mind, that's all.
- You were there.

797
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:18,318
We could always regress you, Mr
Church, take you back 40 years.

798
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,230
- Forget it.
- Well, why not?

799
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:25,108
That way, if you walk through
the door and out onto Miami Beach,

800
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,078
- at least we'd know for certain.
- I'm not Roman.

801
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,916
But you were there.

802
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,396
It was real.

803
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,158
Yes. I'm coming. Yeah?

804
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,151
- Mike, this is Pete.
- Yeah?

805
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,596
- I got a line on Gray Baker.
- So he's still alive?

806
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,990
I got a post office box
in the Valley.

807
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:13,039
- I want to send him a message.
- Hold on. Go ahead.

808
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:16,954
You have it say, "Margaret wants
to know if you still miss the war."

809
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,315
- What?
- No name. Just my number.

810
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,438
Maybe Gray Baker
can make sense out of this.

811
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,274
- I'm afraid of you, Mike.
- You're afraid of a dead man.

812
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,709
You heard what Dr Carlisle said,

813
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,712
about how two people
keep meeting again and again.

814
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,076
Say that's true.
Why would I hurt you?

815
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:40,311
- Why would Roman hurt Margaret?
- I'm not Roman!

816
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,356
Trudy! Will you shut up?

817
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,315
OK, take these.

818
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,556
- Take them!
- Well, I don't want them.

819
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,677
I want you to have them,
so just take them.

820
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,876
OK, all right.

821
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,350
- Will you stop...
- Take the fucking scissors, Grace!

822
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:02,399
Come on. I got some more.
Come on! Let's clear this thing up.

823
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,877
- Mike, don't!
- We can't be too careful.

824
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,520
I might scratch your eyes out
with them.

825
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,990
I know we got some more.
There's got to be some in here.

826
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,878
Mike, please stop it! Stop it!

827
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,157
Here, take it. Sleep with it.
Put it under your pillow.

828
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:23,232
- I come near you, blow my head off.
- No!

829
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:27,950
If you're so fucking afraid of me,
you should be glad to have it!

830
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,552
No!

831
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,554
I'm sorry. It's OK.

832
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,196
I would never hurt you, Margaret.

833
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,432
All right.

834
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,830
Let us begin with the staircase.

835
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:09,911
As you continue down, you become
aware of a door at the bottom.

836
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,756
As you move through this door,

837
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,718
you will recall a memory,
any memory at all.

838
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:20,514
Just tell me the first thing you see
as you go through the door.

839
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:24,036
Remember,
you are no longer an observer.

840
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,872
Where are you?

841
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:28,918
- In a hallway.
- Whose hallway?

842
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,833
- My hallway.
- Who are you?

843
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,959
- I don't know.
- Have a look at yourself.

844
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,671
What do you see?

845
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,274
My leg? I don't know.

846
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,236
I see a candlestick.

847
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:49,791
I'm going through a door.
It's a bedroom, it's my bedroom.

848
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,077
I see pictures
on the walls, a chair...

849
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:57,277
I don't know,
there's this dressing table.

850
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,112
Mr Church, what else do you see?

851
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:05,513
The chair. I see a mirror.

852
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:10,151
- And in the mirror?
- I see myself.

853
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:13,198
Do you know your name?

854
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,316
Yes.

855
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,356
- Well, what is it?
- Strauss.

856
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:26,159
What do you see, Mr Church?
What do you see?

857
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,434
Stop this. Jealous... Have to...

858
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,512
Have to stop this.

859
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,956
I have to stop this.
I have to stop this.

860
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,915
No, Mr Baker.
There's nothing to say. Goodbye.

861
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,316
I think we've heard enough.

862
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,996
No, you haven't.
I'm not Roman, and you were not...

863
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:00,832
Hello!

864
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,990
Mike, I was hoping you'd be here.

865
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,230
Hi, Amanda.

866
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:10,393
- Who?
- That's your name, Amanda Sharp.

867
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,552
Your ID's inside.
Apparently, you're an artist.

868
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:17,713
You live on High Tower, the old
Carl Kay house, with the elevator?

869
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,756
Your neighbour saw the picture.

870
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,991
When they couldn't
reach Mike, they called the paper.

871
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,911
No!

872
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,676
I got to get out of here.

873
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,236
Are you OK?

874
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,917
Look out!
There's no reason to be so upset.

875
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,798
She's got no husband,
no fiancé, no nothing.

876
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,314
- You butthead!
- I checked.

877
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:54,359
We're talking about a profound state
of unattachment.

878
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:01,232
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah. It doesn't matter any more.

879
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,278
Watch the feet, for Christ's sake.
What's the matter with you?

880
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,316
Let me get this straight.

881
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,915
- You were this Margaret Strauss?
- That's right.

882
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,958
The lady with no memory
was your husband?

883
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,792
Roman Strauss.

884
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,510
And 40 years ago, she killed you,
and now she's back again.

885
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,591
Right.

886
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:26,319
It all makes perfect sense.

887
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,313
This gender switching shit
happens all the time.

888
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,517
You can be Bob in one life
and then Betty in the next.

889
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,957
- Husband in one, wife in the next.
- Two halves of the same person.

890
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,793
From this picture,
you look more like him.

891
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,997
- But what a babe you were.
- Come on.

892
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,396
What happens now?

893
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:57,757
Fucking do her, man. Blow her away.

894
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,833
- What?
- One shot, right here.

895
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,799
- You telling me to kill her?
- You do her before she does you.

896
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,917
I thought karma meant
learning from previous lives.

897
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,515
That's what you learned
from this life.

898
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,397
Karmically,
self-defence is quite cool.

899
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,436
Besides, what you've told me,

900
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:22,195
I doubt it's any different today
than it was 40 years ago.

901
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,874
Maybe Roman Strauss
didn't kill his wife.

902
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,919
You know that's not true. He caught
her on the phone and killed her.

903
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,438
- I didn't see him kill her.
- If I were you, I'd forget her.

904
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:39,231
I can't forget her.
I don't know what to do.

905
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,231
Why would she want
to kill me now?

906
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,312
Why do women do anything?

907
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,631
Your neighbour said
you were mugged one night.

908
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,395
You seemed OK,
but the next night you were gone.

909
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,630
Your work's still here, though.

910
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,676
My God!

911
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:19,199
- I live here?
- Give yourself some time.

912
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,550
But I don't recognise anything.

913
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,831
Nothing.

914
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,275
But you will, my dear. You will.

915
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,316
She used to paint seascapes.

916
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,278
Her mind has obviously been stealing
visits to the past for some time

917
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,239
until, apparently, she woke up
one night stranded there.

918
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,473
Why don't you forget all this
metaphysical stuff and call Mike?

919
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,597
I don't think that would
be a good idea at all.

920
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:01,070
Let me be very honest.
At this point, I think it best

921
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:05,233
you have no contact whatsoever
with Mr Church. None.

922
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,232
You don't honestly think
Mike would hurt her.

923
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,675
I think they could hurt each other.

924
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:13,558
I promise you, my dear,
within 24 hours,

925
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:17,590
Mr Church will come riding up
that lovely old elevator

926
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:21,798
with nothing but the sweetest words
and the very best intentions.

927
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:26,715
He'll have a perfect explanation as
to why everything will be just fine.

928
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,758
Before you know it,
you'll be in each other's arms

929
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,274
and you'll feel warm and safe.

930
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:35,113
But I'm telling you
right here and now,

931
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:38,476
any security you feel
will be an illusion.

932
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,358
I'm telling you,
any relationship with Mr Church

933
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,476
can end only one way - violently.

934
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,518
I've known Mike forever.
He'd never hurt her.

935
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:50,832
Mr Dougan, we're talking about fate.
If fate works at all,

936
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:55,118
it's because people think that
this time, it isn't going to happen.

937
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,952
I don't...

938
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:02,471
I've got to run down to the paper for
a while. I'll check on you tonight.

939
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,233
What about tomorrow night
and the night after?

940
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,993
How am I supposed to keep him away?

941
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:11,390
If you can't keep him
away with words, use this.

942
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,594
Sorry.
It's been in my shop for years.

943
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:19,434
It belonged to a famous gangster,
Stinky somebody.

944
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,115
- I can't use that.
- It's old, but it still fires.

945
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,749
- I can't shoot anybody.
- Take it all the same.

946
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:31,231
You don't honestly believe this
stuff, do you? Does Mike?

947
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,311
He found you again, didn't he?

948
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,595
I saw you two together
the other night.

949
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:38,433
You looked good. You looked happy.

950
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:42,152
What about that man
you told me about?

951
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:46,677
That mailman
who chopped up his wife and family.

952
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,959
How happy were they
when they first met?

953
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:05,798
Yeah? This is Mike Church.
Somebody called me.

954
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:10,192
Mr Church, someone would
like to see you, a Mr Gray Baker.

955
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:21,358
He'll ask, but whatever you do,
don't let him smoke.

956
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,512
Gray Baker?

957
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:41,709
- Can I have a cigarette?
- You're not supposed to smoke.

958
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,872
I'm dying.
What the fuck is the difference?

959
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,555
I don't want to get in trouble.
I just want to...

960
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:52,792
You claim someone says
they're Margaret Strauss.

961
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:57,233
I said that they said that they...

962
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,996
They were Margaret Strauss.

963
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:05,194
You know, in a past life.

964
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:13,477
He said it wasn't over.
That's what he said to me.

965
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:18,873
I assume he meant
I hadn't heard the last of him.

966
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,997
I read a book
by Roman's guard on death row.

967
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,435
He said right before
Roman was executed,

968
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:27,193
you asked him if he
really killed his wife.

969
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,989
The guard said Roman
whispered the answer in your ear.

970
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:34,680
- What did he say?
- Why do you want to know?

971
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:37,035
Mr Baker, did Roman kill his wife?

972
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,233
No.

973
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:45,836
Although, at the time,
I honestly thought he did,

974
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:50,277
until I went to see him on death row.

975
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,112
What did he say?

976
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:55,510
- Can I have a cigarette?
- I don't have any. What did he say?

977
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,239
- In your pocket.
- What did Roman tell you?

978
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,914
What did Roman tell you?
What did Roman tell you?

979
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,956
Tell me, Mr Baker!

980
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:06,678
Take it easy. Are you OK?

981
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,716
Jesus. Just...

982
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,716
Want me to get someone?

983
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:30,518
May I please have a cigarette?

984
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,352
Yeah.

985
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,552
No. Keep them. Really. I just quit.

986
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,198
He didn't say anything.

987
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:12,714
Come on. I gave you
a fucking cigarette.

988
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,473
I'm telling the truth. I asked him...

989
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,915
But you still killed her.

990
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,317
Didn't you?

991
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,558
- He kissed me.
- What?

992
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:40,192
He kissed me. The bastard
leaned over and kissed me,

993
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:44,558
and I have not written a word since.

994
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:48,679
Who killed her?

995
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:53,793
- I don't know.
- You've been a big help. Thanks.

996
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,836
Sit down.

997
01:23:56,360 --> 01:24:01,115
If anyone would know,
it would be the housekeeper.

998
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,272
- The housekeeper? lngrid something?
- Inga.

999
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,920
She knew everything
that went on in that house.

1000
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,833
- She's still alive?
- Perhaps.

1001
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:14,118
Last I heard, they had opened
some sort of shop.

1002
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,350
Antiques.

1003
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,915
She and the son
opened an antique shop?

1004
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,070
Antiques.

1005
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:30,110
The Laughing...
The Laughing something.

1006
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,509
- On Robertson.
- On Robertson.

1007
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:05,274
Don't forget the rings and jewellery
in the bureau drawer.

1008
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,636
Our client wants it to
look like simple robbery.

1009
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:12,076
- That's very important.
- OK.

1010
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,390
Let me just check the address again.

1011
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,519
Hi, lnga.

1012
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:25,591
You know who I am.
We don't have much time.

1013
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:28,956
So before I call the police,
I thought I'd stop by,

1014
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,032
see if you'd tell me
why you murdered Margaret Strauss.

1015
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,873
What are you doing here?
Where's Frankie?

1016
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,235
You know what I'm doing here.

1017
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:41,074
You loved Roman. I want the truth.
I'm not leaving without it.

1018
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,594
You don't know anything.

1019
01:25:54,480 --> 01:26:02,239
I never for a moment thought
I was actually in love with him.

1020
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:08,270
- Until he met Margaret.
- First I was really glad.

1021
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:12,239
Margaret was good to Roman.

1022
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,949
For a while,
she was good to Frankie and me, too.

1023
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:24,269
But then they got married
and it all went to hell.

1024
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:29,990
The day of the murder, I decided
to tell Roman how I really felt,

1025
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:33,197
that we were so much happier
before in Germany,

1026
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,477
that we would be happier
there now, together.

1027
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:37,913
I love you.

1028
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,230
But Roman said
he could never love me.

1029
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,915
I tried to explain it to Frankie,
but he couldn't understand

1030
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,231
that Roman and Margaret
truly loved each other.

1031
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:50,756
Mr Baker,
I don't want you to call me any more.

1032
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:54,355
No, Mr Baker, there's nothing to say.
Goodbye.

1033
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,829
- I'm so sorry.
- Roman...

1034
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:09,471
I'm sorry, too.
I haven't been very understanding.

1035
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:12,757
I know you've been unhappy
these past months.

1036
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,671
I just couldn't admit it.

1037
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,160
I couldn't admit that
you might be unhappy with me.

1038
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:24,310
Unhappy with you?

1039
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:27,995
Margaret, I love you.

1040
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:38,629
So Roman loved Margaret and not me,
and Frankie hated her for it.

1041
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,671
I just didn't know how much.

1042
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,669
That same terrible night,

1043
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:49,799
we heard Roman's opera
echoing through the house

1044
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:53,350
for the first and the last time.

1045
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,788
I didn't know what was happening
until it was...

1046
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,991
all over.

1047
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:05,992
Who's there?

1048
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,036
After the murder,

1049
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:16,198
Frankie's speech problem
got worse and worse,

1050
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:21,149
so I took him to England,
to a specialist.

1051
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,870
The guy used hypnosis to cure him.

1052
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:34,034
He told him about the subconscious
and about reincarnation.

1053
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,916
And from that moment on,

1054
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:42,711
the boy was obsessed with the idea
that Margaret would come after him.

1055
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:49,558
And when he found your article
in the newspaper, he knew.

1056
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:53,269
So he hired Dougie the fiancé
to take her from me?

1057
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,432
His real name's Mark.
He's just an actor.

1058
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:59,956
Jesus!
I left Grace alone with your son.

1059
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,996
Wait a minute.

1060
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:11,195
I'm through protecting him.

1061
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,637
- It's all right.
- I had to tell him.

1062
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:52,394
It's all right, Mother.
You should be in bed.

1063
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,396
Up we go.

1064
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:09,792
There.

1065
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:17,835
Just couldn't live with it any more.

1066
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,796
I understand.

1067
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,989
Good night, Frankie.

1068
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,916
Good night, Mother.

1069
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,797
Shit!

1070
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:54,556
- Grace, it's Mike. Let me in.
- Go away!

1071
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:57,916
- I need to talk to you.
- I'm calling the police.

1072
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,596
I know you're upset.
If you'll just listen...

1073
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,636
What did you do to the phone?

1074
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:16,359
- What are you talking about?
- The line is dead.

1075
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:19,796
It's windy out. Lines are
probably out all over the hills.

1076
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,155
- Will you listen?
- Just go away!

1077
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:42,155
Will you just listen to me, OK?

1078
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,950
Don't shoot. Take it easy, Grace.

1079
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:47,792
Where are you going?

1080
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:49,836
- I won't hurt you!
- Go away!

1081
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,434
Take it easy. Look. Listen. Watch.

1082
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:55,273
Roman did not kill his wife.
He was writing the opera.

1083
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,555
Listen, this is for you.

1084
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:26,671
My god.

1085
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,716
What have I done?

1086
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:41,359
- Mr Madson.
- Good evening.

1087
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,956
I shot him.

1088
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:53,270
Thank you. Less work for Frankie.

1089
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:57,637
Who's there? Frankie?

1090
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,035
Antiques.

1091
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,436
This is for you!

1092
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,874
And this is for my mother!

1093
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,112
Margaret?

1094
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,155
It's all over, Frankie!

1095
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:27,390
- Mike, don't!
- Pete, stop it!

1096
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,915
Don't!

1097
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:42,674
I, for one,

1098
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:45,718
am very interested...

1099
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:48,399
to see...

1100
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,752
what's going to happen next.

1101
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,229
Somebody help me!

1102
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:05,556
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

1103
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:08,231
It's OK.

1104
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:13,154
The door just closed.
