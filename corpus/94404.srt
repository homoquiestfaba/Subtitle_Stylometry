1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:00,042
23.976

2
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,644
Castlegard.

3
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,479
Clear!

4
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,774
- 250.
- 250 ready.

5
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,276
Clear!

6
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,778
- 300.
- 300 ready.

7
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,363
Clear!

8
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,450
He's gone.

9
00:01:56,658 --> 00:02:00,954
lt's over 100 degrees out there.
He grabs me with ice-cold hands.

10
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:04,541
Apart from external wounds,
everything is out of alignment.

11
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,336
Even his veins are out of alignment.
Now, wait.

12
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,672
Look at the heart.
The aorta doesn't line up.

13
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,758
And now the spine.

14
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:17,429
Same thing. Same shift
right across the third vertebrae.

15
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:21,850
This guy looks like a paper doll
got cut up and pasted back together.

16
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:27,022
No wallet. No lD.
Just this thing around his neck.

17
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,901
lt says lTC on it,
so we called them.

18
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,363
- That outfit in the desert.
- Our biggest contributors.

19
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,031
Excuse me, gentlemen.

20
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,991
Frank Gordon, lTC.

21
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,410
l'm here to pick up
Vince Taub's body.

22
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,580
l'm Dr. Cova.
l'll take care of that paperwork.

23
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,249
Thank you.

24
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,794
Vincent Taub, huh?

25
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,548
That's Vinnie's good-luck charm.
Thank you.

26
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:57,469
Pretty sad when your time comes and
no one claims you but your employer.

27
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,888
- Excuse me, sheriff.
- Sure.

28
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,016
Gordon.

29
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,811
l'm picking up the body
right now.

30
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,773
{Y:i}- Was he alone or with Decker?
- Taub's the only one here.

31
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:13,026
- Get the body out of there.
- And x-rays and records.

32
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,821
Get everything, OK?
Will it be a problem?

33
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,241
No, there's no problem.
They've been very accommodating.

34
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,787
lf this gets out, lTC is ruined.

35
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,958
Any idea how he ended up
in the desert?

36
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,296
l don't know. Maybe he used his
marker without enough clearance.

37
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,424
- lt could be a million things.
- Not too bright.

38
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,260
He's dead, Robert.

39
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,679
Taub is dead.

40
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,932
Oh, Mr. Gordon, by the way,
what's Castlegard?

41
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,102
l heard that's the only word
he said, ''Castlegard''.

42
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,149
Sounds like an amusement park.

43
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,778
Listen up, class. April 4, 1357.
Castlegard, France.

44
00:03:57,029 --> 00:04:01,575
The English army in their red uniforms
occupied the village of Castlegard.

45
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,453
The French, meanwhile,
were advancing,

46
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,832
trying to drive them out of there,
in this direction over the river,

47
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:14,546
past the monastery and up
and over to the heights here.

48
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,593
Just leave it, Chris, that's fine,
before you wreck the place.

49
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,972
The English army, meanwhile,
had retreated to Castle La Roque.

50
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:27,100
Well fortified, very strong,
very well supplied,

51
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,562
and both sides had settled in
for a long siege.

52
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,024
The French were trying to push
the English out of France.

53
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,236
Lord Oliver tries to take the fight
out of the French.

54
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,238
Now, he has a prisoner, a woman.

55
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,573
A woman of class
and a woman of nobility,

56
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,284
Commander Arnaut's sister,
Lady Claire.

57
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:48,997
He hangs her from the battlements
for all of the French forces to see.

58
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,877
lnstead of demoralizing the French,
it whips them into a frenzy,

59
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,380
and they attack the castle
like madmen,

60
00:04:56,588 --> 00:05:00,843
and they overpower the English
with sheer passion.

61
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,846
So the fortress of La Roque
fell in one night

62
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:07,683
because of the death of one woman,

63
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,601
Lady Claire.

64
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,730
All right, that's enough
of the academics for today.

65
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,357
Go get your hands dirty.

66
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,861
Hi, Chris.

67
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,282
Hey, Dad. l got Marek's clippers.

68
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,743
Oh, Chris, great. Thanks.
Here, hold that, will you.

69
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,204
You can move it around if you like.

70
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:32,666
- l thought this would be a routine trip.
- lt is.

71
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,794
Last time you cut off your beard,
you sold the house

72
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,046
and we moved to Kentucky
for a year.

73
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:41,800
- Your mother wanted a change.
- How does this always happen to me?

74
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,470
l am older and very much wiser
than you. Have a beer.

75
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,265
lt'll cool you down.
Very hot work, ironing.

76
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,058
l know something's going on.

77
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,228
The beard's coming off,
so what's really happening?

78
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,859
lt's these amazing finds
we've been making.

79
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,320
Doniger's been giving us
too many tips.

80
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,948
- He's a lucky zillionaire.
- Nobody's that lucky.

81
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:09,661
He knows something he's not saying.
Something isn't right about this.

82
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,956
He's been ducking me.
l'm gonna get a few answers.

83
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,083
Maybe scrounge a couple of bucks.

84
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,378
Put that in my bag, would you?
And don't wrinkle it.

85
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,424
l'd appreciate it
if you don't tell anybody about this.

86
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,218
Especially Kate.

87
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,970
- Why would l tell Kate?
- Here.

88
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:31,141
Have a wee run round that,
would you? ''Why would l tell Kate?''

89
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,229
You see me twice a year,
stay until you're bored to distraction.

90
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,397
l think the record's three weeks.

91
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:40,567
Maybe l'm just really beginning
to enjoy archeology.

92
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:44,071
From a boy who hated Easter
because he had to find eggs.

93
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,073
- Yeah, because you buried the eggs.
- That's beside the point.

94
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,158
- Yeah, because you buried the eggs.
- That's beside the point.

95
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,620
You're still here because of Kate.

96
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,539
Chris.

97
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,541
Look, son,

98
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,877
l love you,
but you're scorching my shirt.

99
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,254
Sorry.

100
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,464
You and Kate
are from different worlds.

101
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,592
You saw how that turned out
between your mother and me.

102
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:09,680
Yeah, but, Dad, no offense,
l'm not like you.

103
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,807
But Kate is.

104
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,979
Trust me, if it's between
archeology and you,

105
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,148
you'll lose.

106
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,830
- Sorry.
- l'm sorry.

107
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,498
l brought you a beer.

108
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,209
- That's so sweet.
- Half a beer anyways.

109
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,836
Half a beer.

110
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,463
- What you got going on here?
- The stairs.

111
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,508
The ones you were talking about?
Where do they go?

112
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:50,095
Now they don't go anywhere,
but they'll lead me to my tunnel

113
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,472
which will go
all the way to La Roque.

114
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,684
What do you say l help you out?
Show me what to do.

115
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:59,688
- l thought you hated this stuff.
- No, l don't hate it.

116
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,608
Let's have a beer. l need a break.

117
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,652
- You have the full one.
- That's sweet of you.

118
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,070
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

119
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,364
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

120
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,412
Think you'll follow
in your father's footsteps?

121
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,873
- No.
- No.

122
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:23,045
No way. Actually, l'm not really
all that interested in the past.

123
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,924
No? What are you interested in then?

124
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,143
l think l already know
the answer to that question.

125
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,896
l've been hoping that you'd notice.

126
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,732
l've been hoping you'd quit hoping
l'd notice.

127
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,572
So there's nothing there?

128
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,909
- Chris, you are the boss' son.
- So...

129
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,078
there is something there.

130
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:01,625
lt's late. l'll just start on this tomorrow.
But thanks for the beer.

131
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:30,320
- Haven't been practicing, have you?
- l'm not getting any younger.

132
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:33,907
- You love this stuff.
- lt's a habit l can't quite kick.

133
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:38,036
Let me take that from you before
you cut something you'll need later.

134
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,665
So talking about love,

135
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,627
- how did it go last night?
- lt didn't.

136
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:49,965
So how does it feel being passed over
for 600-year-old ruins?

137
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:51,800
lt sucks.

138
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,052
lt sucks big time.

139
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,140
l don't understand you guys.
You live in the past.

140
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:02,686
You know what the past is to me?
The past is why my parents split up.

141
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,148
The past is what l've been force-fed
since l was little.

142
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,483
None of you archeologists
looks to the future.

143
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:13,197
What are you talking about? What is
the future but just more of the same?

144
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:17,075
More gadgets, more machines
like that thing you rode up on.

145
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,412
lt's the past is where it's at,
you know.

146
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,499
People then,
they cared about each other.

147
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,752
- Men had honor, you know?
- No, no.

148
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,963
You know what that is to me?
Romantic warrior crap.

149
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,840
Romantic?

150
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,718
You want to see romantic?
Follow me.

151
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,303
Come on.

152
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,138
Come on!

153
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,183
What have you got?

154
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,853
Oh, another stone
sticking out of the ground.

155
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:50,859
No, it's a 600-year-old sarcophagus
with a French knight and his lady.

156
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:54,363
- Look, isn't she beautiful?
- She's a real knockout.

157
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:58,158
Very funny. Another thing,
down here, they're holding hands.

158
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:02,496
- lncredibly unusual for that period.
- That is kind of unusual, huh?

159
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:06,166
Oh, God, over here.
This knight has only got one ear.

160
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,837
What happened there?

161
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,548
What, one ear?
That piece is missing.

162
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,633
lt's somewhere here in the dirt.

163
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,469
l'm the archeologist.
lt was carved that way.

164
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,555
- Fair enough.
- Trust me.

165
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,140
Who do you think they were?

166
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:26,186
Why would somebody that doesn't
give a shit be concerned with that?

167
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,400
- Because l'm intrigued, all right?
- See?

168
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,652
- What you wanted to hear?
- Yeah.

169
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:37,364
We're all intrigued by this.
That's why we're all here.

170
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:41,618
lt's not just about the rocks
and the rubble.

171
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,287
lt's about these people.

172
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:47,416
Who were they?
And what were their stories?

173
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:52,671
lt helps us to understand where we
came from, or where we're going.

174
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:56,383
- You know what l like to say.
- ''You make your own history.''

175
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,012
- Do l say it that often?
- Yeah, all the time.

176
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,099
Well, whoever they were,

177
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,268
they made theirs

178
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,270
together.

179
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:17,446
lt's best to go really, really slow.
lt's better to be cautious.

180
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,951
Come on. Hurry up!

181
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:28,248
{Y:i}Cave-in at the monastery!
Cave-in at the monastery!

182
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,711
l was standing and the floor gave way
underneath my feet.

183
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,255
- How long has it been open?
- 15 minutes.

184
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,342
We have five minutes
before oxygen contamination.

185
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,135
- Let's move it.
- Be careful.

186
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:43,722
- lt's under where l was working.
- l don't know about this.

187
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:47,142
Can everybody listen up?
Let's be careful, we got that?

188
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,728
l've got your back. Be safe.

189
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,105
- Who's going in first?
- OK, let's go.

190
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,149
- Who's going down first?
- l am.

191
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:57,611
- On belay! On Kate!
- OK, take me down nice and slow.

192
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,697
- Give me a radio check.
- Please be careful.

193
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:03,659
{Y:i}- OK, one-two. Do you read me?
- We're good.

194
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,161
That's good.
Just keep it steady.

195
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,413
- Lower Kate down.
- Lower me down.

196
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,998
Easy, guys.

197
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,459
Nice and slow.

198
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,587
Nice and slow.
l'm getting close to the first level.

199
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,881
- Easy!
- Bring me down, guys.

200
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,801
- A little more on Marek.
- Smell the stale air.

201
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,761
Kate, be careful down there.

202
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:27,224
l'm down. Oh, my God. This is
right below where l was working.

203
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,851
Are you all right?
What's going on?

204
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,937
''All right?'' ''All right'' is not the word.

205
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,189
- One...
- Give me slack on the rope.

206
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:37,025
- More slack!
- Come on, guys.

207
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,407
- Oh, my God.
- This is unbelievable.

208
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:47,327
We are the first people in this room
for 600 years.

209
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,162
These...

210
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,207
These...

211
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,877
...are beautiful.

212
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,135
You won't believe the condition
of these...

213
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,554
- What have you got?
- Come here.

214
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,599
No way. This is too much.
Oh, my God.

215
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,350
- What is it?
- Oh, my God.

216
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,019
An old document box.

217
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,730
We've got an oilskin
with documents inside.

218
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:18,984
- Look at the condition of this thing!
- OK, let's be really careful.

219
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,695
Quick, get the bag.

220
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:26,074
- l can't believe this.
- That is gonna be such a find.

221
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,285
Careful, careful, careful.

222
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:34,124
Let's get this up.
l need the light for a minute.

223
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,085
Oh, my God.

224
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,087
Oh, my God.

225
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,763
- Oh, man!
- Give me the light.

226
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,806
- What kind of...
- lt's amazing.

227
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:56,021
...son of a bitch would deliberately
damage something so beautiful?

228
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,899
Obviously not an archeologist.

229
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,862
We've gotta get out of here.
Let's go!

230
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,280
Guys, we're coming up!

231
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:06,865
Pull it up! Come on!

232
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,535
We want to go up quick, OK?

233
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,079
- Hold this.
- What are you doing, Marek?

234
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,790
- lt's OK.
- What are you doing?

235
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,252
lt's definitely a modern-day
bifocal lens.

236
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,464
l know. And bifocals weren't invented
until the mid-1 700s.

237
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,842
The hole only opened up
today, Stern.

238
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,428
There's been nobody down
that chamber before Kate and l.

239
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:31,265
lf you think that's weird,
you'll love this.

240
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,726
- What is this?
- One of the documents you found.

241
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:39,439
lt's just a simple list of the things
stored in there. Nothing special.

242
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,984
And then we found this. Look.

243
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,991
The professor?

244
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:52,828
''Help me''?
''E.A. Johnston''?

245
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,789
- ''4/2/1357''?
- 1357.

246
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:58,250
- E.A. Johnston.
- What is going on?

247
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:02,004
l cross-matched the signatures.
lt's definitely his handwriting.

248
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,882
But he's only been gone for two days.

249
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:08,969
Your father wrote that,
but he wrote it 600 years ago.

250
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,387
What's going on here?

251
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:14,558
Francois is looking for his spare pair.
l'll see if the prescriptions match.

252
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:18,854
So you're telling me this is the
professor's and it's 600 years old?

253
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,899
- What have you been smoking?
- Maybe you can explain.

254
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:26,236
lf l knew, l'd explain it. All l know
is that the ink is 600 years old.

255
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:28,614
l know. This is my father.
This is him.

256
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:32,117
- He's just playing a prank.
- No! No, there is no way

257
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:36,121
he would risk contaminating the site
as a joke. He just wouldn't.

258
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,124
- Did you carbon-date the ink?
- Of course.

259
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,753
- There's got to be another reason.
- l did it three times.

260
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,341
Like l just said,

261
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,885
your father wrote that note,

262
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,638
but he wrote it 600 years ago.

263
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:03,941
l don't care about lTC's policies.
l'm his son, l wanna talk to him now.

264
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:07,611
l found the professor's glasses.
They were on his desk.

265
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,405
lt's a perfect match. Look.

266
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,450
We should do an optical test
to make sure.

267
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:17,621
l'm sick of this. Either somebody
tell me where Professor Johnston is

268
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,290
or l report a kidnapping
to the authorities.

269
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:22,501
Have l made myself clear?

270
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,505
Just tell us when and where.

271
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,173
What is it?

272
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,926
Doniger's sending a plane for us.

273
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,387
We're going to New Mexico?

274
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,889
Let's pack up, guys.

275
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,349
Good morning.

276
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,521
Steven Kramer, lTC.
Frank Gordon, security.

277
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,232
- Where's my dad?
- You'll see your dad shortly.

278
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:49,236
- Where's Doniger at?
- Doniger's waiting inside.

279
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,114
- Mr. Kramer will explain everything.
- Tell me.

280
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:55,117
How come we have
a 600-year-old document

281
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,245
- with his handwriting?
- Pleading for help.

282
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:01,373
l'll explain as soon
as we get through security.

283
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:04,418
lTC is constantly advancing itself
in science.

284
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:08,380
30 years ago, the business world
was revolutionized with a machine

285
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,800
that sent documents anywhere
with the push of a button.

286
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,887
Doniger's vision was to do that
with 3-D objects.

287
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:18,015
- Like a fax or something?
- Exactly.

288
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:21,894
He's trying to send actual objects
from one place to another?

289
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,146
- Follow me.
- But that's impossible.

290
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,816
He would need a quantum computer
with millions of processors.

291
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:32,237
We used them to build a machine that
could fax three-dimensional objects.

292
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:37,451
l'll explain these mirrors later. lt would
put FedEx and UPS out of business.

293
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,995
- You actually made it work?
- Yes.

294
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:41,455
Across a room.

295
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:44,625
But we wanted to send things
across continents

296
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,878
so we built a bigger machine.
This is the prototype.

297
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:51,507
The prototype?
So that thing that we just passed...

298
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,717
- Exactly.
- ...is the real thing?

299
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:56,178
We gave it a thousand times
more power.

300
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,931
We tried to send something
from New Mexico

301
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:02,059
to a twin machine at a lab
in New York City.

302
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:04,561
Now, here's the interesting part.

303
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,940
The package never arrived
at its destination.

304
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,109
A few hours later,
it showed up back here.

305
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:16,031
Wait a minute. So if it went missing
between New Mexico and New York,

306
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,035
- where did it go in the meantime?
- We asked the same question.

307
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:22,412
So we sent out a camera
over and over,

308
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:27,167
and we got back photos of the
same location, a hillside with trees.

309
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,754
That's when Mr. Doniger
made the brilliant decision

310
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,382
to point the camera straight up.

311
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,718
So once we cross-referenced
star charts to the horizon,

312
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:41,056
we realized that the camera
was not only in the wrong place,

313
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:45,227
- but it was in the wrong time.
- So, what does that mean?

314
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,105
The camera was taking photographs
of a wilderness

315
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:51,567
near Castlegard, France
in the year 1357.

316
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:55,112
So you're saying you accidentally
discovered time travel?

317
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,906
No, we accidentally discovered
a wormhole.

318
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:02,911
A wormhole that seems to be locked
to a single time and place in the past:

319
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,873
1357, Castlegard.

320
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:11,211
So you faxed my father's glasses and
documents back to the 1 4th century?

321
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,255
No, Chris.

322
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:18,802
Your father is in the 1 4th century.

323
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:20,262
What?

324
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,849
- We need you to help get him back.
- Mr. Robert Doniger,

325
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,392
this doesn't make sense.

326
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:29,980
A wormhole is a volatile force.
You can't send a person through one.

327
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,900
Can't fit a piece of paper
through a telephone wire.

328
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,318
But you can send a fax.

329
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:38,572
Sure, once you've broken the message
into a stream of electrons, but...

330
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,283
- Oh, shit.
- Now, look,

331
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,077
l don't care
about the hows or the whys.

332
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:47,164
l care about my father.
Did he know about all this?

333
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,082
l thought we could help each other.
We'd give him hints

334
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:50,459
l thought we could help each other.
We'd give him hints

335
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,712
about the best excavation areas,
and he could discover

336
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,965
why we're locked
into this particular place and time.

337
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,302
So this is why you've been
funding our dig.

338
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,681
He was more astute than l thought.
We gave him too many clues

339
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,643
and he became very, very suspicious.

340
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,771
How could you send him there?
God knows where he is...

341
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:14,691
Oh, he's a very persuasive man.
He insisted on going.

342
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:17,694
- Now he's stuck.
- That's where you all come in.

343
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:19,905
Do we look like
wormhole specialists?

344
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:23,075
You sent the professor
to the Hundred Years' War?

345
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,827
- Right.
- Turbulent times you sent him to.

346
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,497
We need cultural experts,
not scientists.

347
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,041
My people don't know
about the medieval world

348
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,919
or how to mingle,
which is what we have to do

349
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,172
if we are to find the professor
and bring him back.

350
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:39,967
So we bring him back,
it's that simple.

351
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:44,930
We step on that machine and whiz
back to 1357 to get him back?

352
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,100
Once he's broken us
into a stream of electrons.

353
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:52,563
- Why should we do what you ask us?
- l think we need to know more...

354
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:56,316
- l know you have a lot of questions...
- A lot of questions.

355
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,403
The professor's already been gone
for 72 hours

356
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,198
and every minute he's there,
it'll be more difficult to find him.

357
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:05,033
- That's true.
- Bob?

358
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:08,662
Excuse me. l need to get them
changed if they're going to go.

359
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,748
- Frank, change with them.
- l'm not going.

360
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:14,960
- Gomez and Baretto are ready.
- We need to think...

361
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:18,338
- l'd like you along.
- We didn't say we were going.

362
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,300
Steve, can you bring them
to prep, please.

363
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,635
Sure. Folks, this way.

364
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,181
Thank you. Please, this way.
Thank you.

365
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:30,475
Just follow Steve.
He'll take you to the prep room.

366
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:35,564
Bob, look, Gomez and Baretto
are my two best men.

367
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:39,151
They can handle any situation.
l would prefer not going.

368
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,196
l really want you to go.

369
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,615
And if you see Decker,
you know what to do.

370
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:46,366
Robert...

371
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:57,377
You know, that was a really
great speech you made.

372
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:59,421
l almost believed it myself.

373
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,715
- Didn't you forget something?
- What?

374
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:06,220
Come on. Look at Taub's MRls.
Look at his arteries.

375
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:09,515
This was his tenth trip.
This is their first and only.

376
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:13,435
They deserve to know that we don't
know how he ended up in the desert.

377
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,938
You don't think they deserve
to know that?

378
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,689
l've told them enough.

379
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,111
How did my father get stuck
back there?

380
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:25,113
Doniger gave him an hour.

381
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:28,408
Things got harried,
and l lost him in the woods.

382
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:31,078
- You left him there.
- We have a limited time.

383
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:33,455
l had to come back
or we'd both be stuck.

384
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:36,208
l guess it's better him
than you, right?

385
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:41,171
Listen, there's a few things
we have to go over before we leave.

386
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,550
They need your vital data.
lt's for your return process.

387
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:48,136
Change from your clothes
into those clothes over there.

388
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:51,473
Anything you want.
Put your personals in the lockers.

389
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:55,352
l want to introduce you to two friends,
Bill Baretto, Jimmy Gomez.

390
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:58,397
They're coming with us.
Buddies from the Marines.

391
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:02,484
- Why do we need Marines?
- Just in case something goes wrong.

392
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:06,321
l like to have all my bases covered.
All right, let's change up.

393
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:10,951
l can't believe you're considering this.
Do you understand what it does?

394
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,745
lt strips you down
to a molecular level,

395
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,540
which means, for a moment,
you cease to exist.

396
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:20,169
- Listen to him, he's got a point.
- Hold on! Wait a second.

397
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:22,880
l don't need you, Miss Ericson.
Or Chris.

398
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:26,550
- l need you. You know the layout.
- Nobody knows it like l do.

399
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:28,927
- l go.
- There's no way l'm not going.

400
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:32,681
l just said l'm not going,
so don't touch me!

401
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,391
Thanks.

402
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:38,604
Stern, we don't need you back there.
You're a physicist.

403
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,315
- Your knowledge won't help us.
- l'm sorry.

404
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:45,110
But we are going to need you,
Francois.

405
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:49,364
- Why do we need him?
- Because he speaks French fluently.

406
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:51,867
- He's right.
- My high-school French sucks.

407
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,036
- Don't do this.
- We need his help.

408
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:56,413
- l'll cover you.
- Don't pressure him.

409
00:24:56,955 --> 00:25:00,125
Francois, you have to make
your own decision on this.

410
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,838
Your father would've done it for me,
so, yes, l'll come.

411
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:07,174
- OK.
- Yes.

412
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:10,886
Thank you.

413
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,223
Thank you.

414
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,017
- Magnetic coils ready.
- Verifying now.

415
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:18,435
Platform up.

416
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:20,979
Computers are up, Mr. Doniger.

417
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,358
Tell Gordon we've got to get going.

418
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:27,736
Keep a couple of beers
cold for me, all right?

419
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,364
Mr. Stern.

420
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:32,824
Watch our backs, OK?

421
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:36,119
lt will be all right.
We'll be back before you know it.

422
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:39,540
- Take it easy, bro.
- You know the 50 bucks l owe you?

423
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,416
All right, let's move it.

424
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,378
Frank, six hours
and the clock is running.

425
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,922
Wear these personal markers
around your neck.

426
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,133
You can use any one of them
to call for your return.

427
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,595
Frank will explain their intricacies
once you arrive.

428
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:57,683
Most importantly, one marker
will bring all of you back.

429
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:00,060
- Do not lose them.
- What about weapons?

430
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:02,771
Nothing modern goes back.
Especially weapons.

431
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,983
- They're set for a six-hour countdown.
- Countdown?

432
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:09,611
- They burn out after six hours.
- And then?

433
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:12,406
l'll get you back before you know it.

434
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:13,866
Oh.

435
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:17,619
Sorry, Francois,
they didn't have these back then.

436
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,037
l don't see without...

437
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:22,457
You'll be fine. That's where
we goofed with the professor.

438
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:27,337
l feel morally compelled to inform you
that there is a degree of pain.

439
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:31,008
l'm told it's rather intense,
but extremely fleeting.

440
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:33,677
A couple of seconds.
No residual discomfort.

441
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:37,639
So forgive me, l didn't want that
to influence your decision.

442
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:42,102
- OK. Good luck.
- Let's do it.

443
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:45,480
You all look great.
Miss Ericson, you look divine.

444
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:46,940
Good luck.

445
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:50,819
Don't worry about it.
You guys will be home for lunch.

446
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:56,200
- Think of it as the ultimate field trip.
- A fantastic thing for an archeologist.

447
00:26:56,408 --> 00:27:00,204
- l can't believe we're doing this.
- Slowly. There are no railings.

448
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:00,996
Josh, come on down. Come watch.

449
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:02,789
Josh, come on down. Come watch.

450
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:06,001
- Yeah, l'm fine.
- Take a place around the perimeter.

451
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,712
- Spread out.
- Move around the platform.

452
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:12,591
Take a deep breath, relax.
We'll be back before you know it.

453
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,970
- Are we set?
- All systems check.

454
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:19,264
Come in, Josh. Close the door.

455
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:21,642
- Good luck.
- Six hours and counting.

456
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:26,271
Mr. Marek? Mr. Marek,
l need you to take your position.

457
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,023
How's everybody doing?

458
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:31,568
- What the hell are we doing?
- Getting the chance of a lifetime.

459
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,822
Nothing to worry about.
We'll take care of you.

460
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,825
Just relax. Everything will be fine.

461
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,997
- DNA streams locked in.
- Thank you.

462
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:47,543
- OK, lock them in.
- Locking in.

463
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:06,895
- How long does it take?
- A couple of seconds.

464
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:10,440
Watch it here.

465
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,862
Mirrors locked.

466
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:33,714
Son of a...

467
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:56,862
Where is he? Francois!

468
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:02,451
- Are you all right?
- Where's Francois? Francois?

469
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,411
- There he is!
- Francois!

470
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,246
Pull him out!

471
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,794
Now we wait.

472
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:19,718
Give me your hand!

473
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:24,264
- Come on!
- Francois, hold on! Hold on!

474
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:26,433
Hold on!

475
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,770
- Here, take my hand.
- You all right?

476
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:32,022
You all right?
Everybody all right?

477
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,942
That was a close one.
All right.

478
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,945
Let's head up this hill.
Everybody follow me up.

479
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:43,075
- Hell of a start.
- We've always arrived on land.

480
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:45,494
- Gordon, is this it?
- l think so.

481
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,996
You think so?
Are we in 1357 France?

482
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:50,832
- This could be Oregon.
- Gordon, where are we?

483
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:54,127
Shut up!
Trust me, we're in 1357 France.

484
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:58,006
- Well, if this is France, l'm home.
- Come on, let's go.

485
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:03,095
Let me explain the markers. Press
here, it shows the remaining time.

486
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:05,222
Squeeze it, it takes you home.
But don't.

487
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,307
- Why?
- We haven't found his dad yet.

488
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:10,060
One last thing...

489
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:13,856
- He said, ''Hide''. Everyone hide.
- All right, take cover.

490
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:16,149
Let's go! Move! Now!

491
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:19,027
Francois, come on!

492
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:39,756
Well done, Sir De Kere.

493
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,553
- After him.
- Yes, my lord.

494
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,055
Get the others.
Find out who they are.

495
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,229
Come on, quick.

496
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:00,068
Oh, God! Baretto!

497
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:18,086
We got a field buck!
They're coming back!

498
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:23,300
- Oh, my God.
- Get a medic!

499
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:25,052
Get a medic up here!

500
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:28,138
- What was that? What was that?
- What?

501
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:29,765
What is that?

502
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:31,642
That's a grenade! Get down!

503
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:44,446
Oh, my God, he's left.

504
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,408
Get down! He'll see you!

505
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:54,873
You! Over here!

506
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,224
Let's go. Come on, come on!

507
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,936
All right, let's go.

508
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:22,109
Come on. Chris!

509
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:23,986
Kate!

510
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:26,029
Marek! Hey.

511
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:29,992
- Where's my boys? Where's Marek?
- The guys came after Baretto.

512
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,621
He took some arrows and then
he pressed his marker. He's gone.

513
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,791
He took two arrows,
and he must have hit his marker.

514
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:40,794
- Where's Gomez?
- l didn't see him.

515
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:44,381
Oh, my God.

516
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,133
Don't look.

517
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,345
- What are you doing?
- Oh, shit. l can't find his marker.

518
00:32:50,596 --> 00:32:53,182
You're looking for his marker?
He's dead!

519
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,435
- What are you doing?
- l'm getting us out of here.

520
00:32:56,685 --> 00:33:00,147
- We're not going anywhere.
- We can't save anyone if we're dead!

521
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:02,524
- Keep it quiet.
- You can't do that.

522
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:04,234
Why not?!

523
00:33:04,443 --> 00:33:07,696
You need 40 feet of clearance
around all sides to work.

524
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:09,823
- What?
- l was trying to tell you.

525
00:33:10,032 --> 00:33:11,992
Don't lose these. They're precious.

526
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:15,871
And if you follow my lead, l will
get your dad and get you home.

527
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,874
- Francois, it's going to be OK.
- Let's find Marek.

528
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:22,252
- What about Gomez?
- We can't do anything about him now.

529
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:26,465
- We gotta go. Look at me.
- Francois, come on.

530
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:52,699
Be quiet! The soldiers!

531
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:56,912
You passed us. You passed us
in the woods. lt's OK. lt's OK.

532
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:05,420
- We've lost the trail.
- Damn it.

533
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:07,631
- Pick it up again.
- Yes, Sir De Kere.

534
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,092
Search down by the river.

535
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:15,681
Jesus, you're a girl.

536
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:18,767
lt's OK.

537
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,292
After the French bastards!

538
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:02,895
After them! Leave none living!

539
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:08,066
Careful.

540
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:12,404
- There you are.
- No.

541
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,373
Help! Help!

542
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:53,779
Shut it off!

543
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:55,822
He knew not to take
anything modern.

544
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:58,992
That son of a bitch brought
a grenade back with him.

545
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:00,786
l can't believe it.

546
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:03,413
The coils. The coils.

547
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:07,167
Damn it! He knew the regulations,
no modern weapons!

548
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,547
- Gomez?
- The lines are online!

549
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:15,467
- Well...
- His marker.

550
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,180
- What happened to the rest of them?
- Get a medic over here!

551
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:22,349
- l don't know.
- Give me your gloves.

552
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:24,893
Well, did anyone try
to come back with him?

553
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:28,021
l don't know. l know as much
as you, OK? Hang on.

554
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,399
What if they're trying
to come back now?

555
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:33,485
- lt's not gonna happen...
- Don't jump to conclusions.

556
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:36,363
You can't leave seven people
stuck back there!

557
00:36:36,572 --> 00:36:39,116
- Tell me you have a backup plan...
- Shut up!

558
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:42,202
l don't know. l don't know.

559
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:46,707
Please tell me you
have a backup plan.

560
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:52,963
Yes, we have a backup plan.

561
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,593
Go!

562
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:15,569
Gordon! Gordon! lt's Marek! Chris!

563
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:18,071
This Frenchwoman
will lead us to Castlegard.

564
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:21,867
Great. That's great.
Let's go. Come on.

565
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,682
Wow. The village of Castlegard.
We're here.

566
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:48,685
Where is everyone going?

567
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:53,732
Hold on a second.

568
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:57,402
- What day is this?
- Marek...

569
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,905
lt's the fourth of April.

570
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,659
- Of course it is. lt's April 4th.
- 1357.

571
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,453
- The day La Roque falls?
- Wait, wait.

572
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:09,414
- What are you talking about?
- You son of a bitch.

573
00:38:09,623 --> 00:38:11,500
- Excuse me?
- You brought us back

574
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,710
on the day the French attack.

575
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:17,172
By tonight, this whole place
is gonna be burned to the ground.

576
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:20,133
Stop with the history
and look for the professor.

577
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:21,802
Now, follow me.

578
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:24,888
Let's go.

579
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:33,856
l'm a physicist. Give me
something to do. l can help.

580
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:36,900
- Might as well be a pharmacist.
- Good one, Robert.

581
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:40,362
- Replacement panels are on their way.
- How long will this take?

582
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:42,865
Five hours and 27 minutes.

583
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:46,201
How do you know it's gonna
take 5 hours and 27 minutes?

584
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,121
Because that's all the time we have.

585
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:53,792
Once this platform is fixed,

586
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:58,297
even if the markers run out, we can
send someone back to get them?

587
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:01,717
The thing holding the wormhole open
is their markers.

588
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:04,720
But you've opened and closed
it dozens of times.

589
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:07,598
- Once the platform...
- Look, we don't even know

590
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:10,225
what we did to link us
to this wormhole.

591
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:14,521
A lucky calibration, chance impurity
in the coils. The point is, the grenade

592
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,441
probably destroyed any possibility
of re-creating it.

593
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:20,903
Once their markers expire,
they could be stuck there forever?

594
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:23,488
- ls that what you're saying?
- They could be.

595
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,221
Guys, come on. Come on, come on.

596
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:51,517
Come on. Come on.
Come on, this way.

597
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:55,479
Castle La Roque awaits its soldiers.

598
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,234
- The manor house.
- Look at that.

599
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:03,654
l can't believe it.
We were just working on it.

600
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:05,614
That's Castlegard, all right.

601
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:08,492
lt's different.
That right section, l had wrong.

602
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:12,454
- Where did that tower come from?
- What if my Dad's in there?

603
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:16,625
- Yeah, you're right.
- How are we gonna get in?

604
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,210
Guys, soldiers coming.

605
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:19,837
- You there!
- Come on.

606
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:21,713
Why aren't you packing up?

607
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:24,591
- Run! Run!
- Halt! Stop!

608
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,761
- Go, go, go, go!
- Don't let them get away!

609
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:38,856
Get that horse out of the way!

610
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,543
My lord!

611
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:08,552
- Pick him up.
- Come on, my friend.

612
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,430
- Who are they?
- We captured them in the village.

613
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:20,314
l am Lord Oliver.
Who speaks for you?

614
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,359
- l do, my lord.
- You speak strangely.

615
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:27,821
Yes, we are Scottish, my lord.

616
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:32,826
Scottish? You've come
to kill us all in our beds?

617
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,045
First the old man
and now this group.

618
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:46,006
Why do the Scottish
find this village so pleasing?

619
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:49,468
- lt must be your lord's kind manners.
- lndeed it must.

620
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:51,386
My lady.

621
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,308
- l beg your pardon, my lord.
- Let him speak.

622
00:41:56,517 --> 00:42:00,896
- My lord, the old man you spoke of...
- Edward De Johnness?

623
00:42:02,689 --> 00:42:04,942
He claims he's a magister.

624
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,362
- Do you know of him?
- He's our master, sir.

625
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:11,031
- All is well with him?
- He said he was alone.

626
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:17,371
We were several days behind him.
He does not know we are here.

627
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:26,547
Who are you?

628
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:30,801
Yes, you. The one whose head
is touching the ceiling.

629
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:34,054
Francois, my lord.

630
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,057
A Frenchman.

631
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:41,603
Hold. Please. Please.
We're all gentlemen here.

632
00:42:41,812 --> 00:42:44,356
He's our interpreter, sir.

633
00:42:45,774 --> 00:42:49,736
Forgive them. l'm at war with the
French, as well as the Scottish.

634
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,574
Have l forgotten anyone?
The Spaniards, am l at war with them?

635
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:59,580
Arnaut has sent many spies
into my midst.

636
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:01,832
- No, he's not a spy.
- No?

637
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:05,794
- He's our friend.
- l'm sure he is.

638
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:08,255
He's too tall to be a spy, anyway.

639
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:21,351
- lnterpret.
- Be quiet.

640
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:26,523
lnterpret.

641
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:33,572
- l'm a spy.
- l'm sorry, l didn't quite catch that.

642
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:38,660
- lt means...
- Be quiet, Francois.

643
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:43,749
...l am a spy.

644
00:43:43,957 --> 00:43:46,585
My God, it's a miracle.
A quiet Frenchman.

645
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:48,420
- Did you hear that?
- No.

646
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:51,006
Louder, boy! Come on!

647
00:43:52,674 --> 00:43:54,676
l am a spy.

648
00:43:58,263 --> 00:44:00,349
l thought so.

649
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:13,654
- Oh, my God!
- Get rid of the Frenchman.

650
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:16,156
Put them with the old man.
We may need them.

651
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:18,116
Who's next?

652
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:20,327
- No!
- No, Chris!

653
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:22,829
Don't! Don't!

654
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:27,501
Oh, Francois. Francois.

655
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:34,049
lnside!

656
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,638
- Up! Move it! Move it!
- No! Don't push me!

657
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:41,723
- Hey, leave her alone!
- Move it, ease on!

658
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,727
- All right, you bloody Scottish!
- Hold on!

659
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:47,896
l'm moving!

660
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:51,900
Over here, Andre.
This way. Come on.

661
00:44:57,823 --> 00:45:00,409
My marker. Guys, l lost my marker!

662
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:03,537
Don't worry, we only need one marker
to get home, OK?

663
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:06,415
- This can't be happening.
- Careful with the rest.

664
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:08,959
Those bastards killed Francois.

665
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:21,180
Professor.

666
00:45:22,723 --> 00:45:24,433
Professor!

667
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:26,560
- Kate?
- Yeah.

668
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:31,940
- Kate. Oh, my God, Kate.
- Are you all right?

669
00:45:32,149 --> 00:45:34,902
Oh, my God. You got my message.

670
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:37,321
Chris, your dad.

671
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:41,116
- Chris is here and Marek's here.
- Dad?

672
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:42,701
- Son.
- Dad.

673
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,621
- Chris, my son.
- Glad you're still alive.

674
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:48,207
Oh, God.

675
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:51,126
What happened?

676
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:55,631
- You've lost such blood.
- lt's not my blood.

677
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,634
lt's Francois'.

678
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:01,720
He's dead.

679
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:04,306
Oliver had him killed
because he's French.

680
00:46:04,515 --> 00:46:08,227
This guy had a sword
and he just ran him through.

681
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:12,856
Professor, what happened?

682
00:46:13,524 --> 00:46:18,946
l was trying to avoid the English,
but they found me in the monastery.

683
00:46:19,154 --> 00:46:22,199
l convinced Oliver l was a magister
on my way to Dublin.

684
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:24,701
l skipped Shakespeare.
What is a magister?

685
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:27,955
- lt's a scientist.
- He accused me of being a spy.

686
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:32,626
- How did you survive that?
- l promised Oliver a new weapon.

687
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:34,086
What kind of weapon?

688
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:39,550
A liquid fire so intense
that even water couldn't harm it.

689
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:43,887
Greek fire?
You promised him Greek fire?

690
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:47,599
Professor, l'm sorry, have you
considered what you may have done?

691
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:51,061
You've given the English
a serious advantage in this battle.

692
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,523
- They're supposed to lose the war!
- l was alone!

693
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:57,651
- Marek, Marek!
- l'm sorry, l'm sorry. You're right.

694
00:46:58,068 --> 00:47:00,571
The point is,
when these guys come here,

695
00:47:00,904 --> 00:47:05,075
and take us up to La Roque,
when they seal that place off for battle,

696
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:07,619
there is no escape.
We're as good as dead.

697
00:47:07,828 --> 00:47:10,873
- No, we gotta get out of here now.
- Wait, wait, wait.

698
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:13,584
Remember that field
where the peasant huts were?

699
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:17,004
That's the closest place
with enough room to use the marker.

700
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:19,756
- How do we get there?
- We have to do it fast.

701
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:23,302
- We've got four hours.
- Four hours is plenty.

702
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,930
The way l see it, we've got 650 years
of knowledge on these guys.

703
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:31,143
There's no reason why we shouldn't
be able to get home in 20 minutes.

704
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:34,021
- OK, let's find a way out.
- Let's look around.

705
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:07,387
There's a hole here
big enough to climb through.

706
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:11,391
- Quiet!
- OK, all right.

707
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:18,774
She was with the group
we caught earlier, my lord.

708
00:48:18,982 --> 00:48:22,444
May l ask why
you're trespassing on my land?

709
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:31,161
Come, come.

710
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:33,413
- What are you doing?
- Here's what l'll do:

711
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:38,085
l'm gonna scale down the wall. When
it's clear, l'm gonna let you guys out.

712
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:40,796
- All right.
- You're not going anywhere.

713
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:42,756
What? l am, l'm...

714
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:46,260
Marek, l'm the best climber.
l am the best climber.

715
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:48,679
lf anyone should
be going, it should be me,

716
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:51,974
but those roof slats won't
hold me, or you, or you, Chris.

717
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:53,475
- No, no...
- Wait. Wait.

718
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:56,061
But they might hold you, Kate.

719
00:48:57,354 --> 00:49:00,732
Now, Kate, this isn't a game.
Are you prepared to take a life?

720
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:04,111
l'll do what l have to do.

721
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:07,739
There's no way.
You're not going anywhere.

722
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,950
lt's going to be all right, OK?

723
00:49:10,158 --> 00:49:13,912
There's one thing worse than
dying here, and that's living here.

724
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:17,791
l refuse to do either.
l'm going. lt's OK.

725
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,418
She's right.

726
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:22,379
Kate.

727
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:27,342
- Please, please take care.
- Hey, it's easy. lt's gonna be easy.

728
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:31,847
Chris, l need your help. Come on.

729
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:35,893
l need you to hold that back
and keep it open.

730
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:38,020
All right?

731
00:49:44,735 --> 00:49:46,945
- Kate, be careful.
- OK, here l go.

732
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:48,780
- Easy.
- There's guards there.

733
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,282
l'm gonna go up and over.

734
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:53,285
- There's a window on the side.
- OK, watch yourself.

735
00:50:24,816 --> 00:50:26,902
l got you! l got you! Hold on!

736
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:31,740
Hold on. l got you. Don't let go.

737
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:34,576
- Are you OK?
- l've got a foothold.

738
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:37,579
- We're gonna pull you back in.
- No, l'm good.

739
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,416
- OK, please be careful.
- l've got to keep going.

740
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:47,339
You, man! Gather those children
and move!

741
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:50,467
All clear on the outside.

742
00:51:25,586 --> 00:51:28,589
Hold your line, men! ln position!

743
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:38,140
Too much ale.
We'll play again when l get back.

744
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:42,144
Keep them quiet.

745
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:12,174
- What the...?
- Now!

746
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:23,185
Grab a weapon!

747
00:52:24,811 --> 00:52:27,689
- Let's go. Chris!
- Very sorry.

748
00:52:27,898 --> 00:52:30,817
We're heading out the way
we came in, all right? Marek?

749
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:32,861
- Marek!
- Yeah, yeah. You go ahead.

750
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:35,697
- l'll take the rear.
- All right, let's go!

751
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:38,242
Kate, we gotta go.

752
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:52,840
Oh, be careful!

753
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:56,218
Let's go! Come on. Let's go!

754
00:52:56,927 --> 00:52:58,387
Quiet.

755
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:03,475
You guys go ahead.
l'll catch up with you.

756
00:53:03,684 --> 00:53:05,394
- What are you doing?
- Listen.

757
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:07,062
- Are you crazy?
- Let's go.

758
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:10,232
- l got my marker, l'll catch up.
- Come on.

759
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:14,987
- Where is he?
- He'll catch up. He's got his marker.

760
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:22,703
- Robert!
- Yeah?

761
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,541
DNA streaming should
be online...now.

762
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:29,418
- Got it!
- Fully functioning?

763
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:32,546
- Yeah!
- lt's a start.

764
00:53:55,944 --> 00:53:58,030
- Don't move. Don't say a word.
- Traitor!

765
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:17,174
Jesus. Why didn't you listen to me?

766
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:29,520
Shit!

767
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:39,613
For God's... Jesus!
Scotsman! Stop, it's me!

768
00:54:39,863 --> 00:54:41,448
Stop!

769
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:52,042
What? What are you saying?

770
00:54:52,835 --> 00:54:54,336
Ax! Give me the ax!

771
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:56,839
And help me watch for the wall!

772
00:54:57,047 --> 00:54:59,424
Move that stuff!
Put it against the door!

773
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:04,137
- Help me!
- Get out of the way, woman!

774
00:55:04,888 --> 00:55:06,139
Get out of the way!

775
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:20,279
Please! Come on!
There we go!

776
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:28,871
Go!

777
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:39,339
Guards!

778
00:55:43,093 --> 00:55:45,888
- Who is that guy?
- His name is De Kere.

779
00:55:48,932 --> 00:55:51,894
Come on. Quick,
let's head back to the river.

780
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:53,770
Get more guards!

781
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:57,232
- We're not going without Marek.
- l don't give a shit about Marek.

782
00:55:57,441 --> 00:56:00,444
My job was to get the professor.
l can't take care of you.

783
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:04,656
l lost Gomez, Baretto. You guys are
on your own. Or follow me. Let's go!

784
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:13,874
To the river, quick.

785
00:56:20,422 --> 00:56:23,217
We have a field buck.
Somebody's trying to come back.

786
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:25,594
- How strong?
- lt's minimal.

787
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:29,348
- What does that mean?
- lt means they're still alive.

788
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:38,690
Halt!

789
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:47,783
Come on. Come on.

790
00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:51,119
Where is he? Where's Gordon?

791
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:52,788
Where's...?

792
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:56,458
- There he is. There he is.
- l saw him. Come on!

793
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:59,878
- Wait. Watch it.
- Chris! Drop your weapon.

794
00:57:02,256 --> 00:57:04,132
OK. Go.

795
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:06,885 
Oh, shit.

796
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:09,680 
- Come on!
- Gonna leave us like you left my dad?
