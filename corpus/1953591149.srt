miss k., welcome to my world.

- this is gonna be interesting.

186

but when i am through with you,

200
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:42,359
you will have grown
into trees...

201

we're gonna have a great week.

00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,669
there will be
physical challenges

206
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,504
led by sergeant hoke,

207
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:06,383
and i'll be continuing
our counseling sessions here.

208
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,427
by the end of the week,
we hope this experience

209
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,722
inspires you to make changes
in your life

210
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,223
and better choices.

211
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,018

212
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:19,396

in that dump for a week.

s.t.u.m.p.s don't stay
in the cabin.

215
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:25,027
s.t.u.m.p.s stay outside.

216
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:28,155
s.t.u.m.p.s, set up the tents
by the campfire circle.

217
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,406
move out.

218
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,087
hold on.

219
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,344
- i'm not sharing a tent
with you.

220
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:52,471
- oh, i know.
i'll be sleeping in the cabin.

221
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:53,764
- what?

222
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:55,599
- i'm not here
to share anything,

223
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,142
least of all hardships.

224
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,435
i may not have a fancy degree,

225
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,479
but s-g-t,

226
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,314

(flesh squishing)

232
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,693
- several people got shot.

233
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:32,279
it was a drive-by.

234
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,617
the d.a. wanted me to testify,
but i couldn't.

235
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:40,370
i was worried for myra,
my daughter.

236
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,456
- you have a daughter?
- yeah.

237
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:45,209

238
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:47,336
(both laugh)

239
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,546
- when i get out of here,
i'm gonna get her back.

240
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,673
- hey, i cut a deal
to get out the bigger fish.

241
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,217
you got busted for talking.

242
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,260
talking's what saved my ass.

243
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,720
- figures.

244
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,140
a hood rat like you
selling drugs.

245
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,769
- hey, i had friends,
and they needed things.

246
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:05,854
just so happens
what they needed wasn't legal.

247
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:09,525
- what you do differently
if you could go back in time?

248
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,238
- probably invest in google.

249
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:16,532
(laughter)

250
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:19,618
- trish, you're up.

251
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,245
- (scoffs)

252
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:25,332
there was this bar fight.
cops showed up.

253
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,417
one of them asked me
what happened,

254
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:32,256
and the officer behind him
wouldn't stop staring at my ass.

255
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,590
- (laughs)

256
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,468
- so i popped him.

257
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,720
- excuse me, ma'am,
but you do have a nice ass.

258
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,723
- (laughs)

259
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:44,518
- c.b., it's your turn.

260
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,854
- i was coming back
from a party.

261
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:50,399
i was a little buzzed.

262
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,943
the car in front of me
ran this red light.

263
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,571
i couldn't stop in time,
and i hit him.

264
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:57,531
the driver got thrown
from the car.

265
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,950
- you weren't hurt at all?

266
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,578
- just a little cut on my knee.

267
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:04,538
the other driver
wasn't hurt either,

268
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,957
but he reeked of booze.

269
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,626
- he was drunk too?

270
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,462
- it was his third offense
for drunk driving.

271
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:13,505
- oh.

272
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,798
- he hit three cars in town

273
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,885
before he ran that light.

274
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:20,512
- you stopped that guy
from killing someone.

275
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:21,972
you deserve--

276
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,433
you deserve a medal
rather than being here.

277
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,767
- that's right.

278
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,854
the system is messed up.
it's not fair.

279
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:32,357
- well, two d.u.i.s
don't make a right.

280
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,775
she did break the law.

281
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:37,279
- screw that.
i would've hired a lawyer.

282
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,655
sued him for a million.

283
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,366
- a million?
i would've got 12 million.

284
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,827
- my lawyer said it was better
to just plead guilty

285
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,287
than to fight it.

286
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:47,498
- and you thought
that was unfair.

287
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:51,001
- he ran the light.
i was just a little buzzed.

288
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:54,338
nobody could've stopped in time.

289
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,672
i shouldn't be here.

290
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,257
- no one thinks
they should be here.

291
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:00,010
- hey, i'm glad you're all here.

292
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,513
we all have things
we keep inside,

293
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:05,349
stuff we don't want to share.

294
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:06,850
by the time we're finished,

295
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,560
i'm hoping we've all grown
into something

296
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,395
bigger than ourselves.

297
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:14,942
- trees grow tall,
and then the trees fall!

298
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,693
- what the--
- but the river--

299
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:19,738
the river only goes one way.

300
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:21,698
- sir,
this is a private meeting.

301
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,617
i'd appreciate it
if you'd moved on.

302
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,327
- is he part of the program?

303
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:26,870
- somebody grab the camera.

304
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,373
i think we just found bigfoot.

305
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:30,666
- god damn it, s.t.u.m.p.s.

306
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,292
what in the name
of sweet lorraine

307
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,877
is going on out here?

308
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:36,755
oh, hello, meeks.
i thought i smelled you.

309
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,632
- (laughs)

310
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:40,717
fire's a fire.
i'm just keeping warm.

311
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,053
that's all.

312
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,430
- you got my invitation
to the party then.

313
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,682
oh, you know, that's funny,

314
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:48,392
'cause i didn't send you one.

315
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:49,685
now, i want you to clear out
of here

316
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:52,354
and stop interrupting
my angry sleep.

317
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,606
i've got this campground
for the next six days,

318
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,567
and that means six days,
i don't see you,

319
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,777
i don't hear you, and i sure as
hell don't want to smell you.

320
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,445
savvy?

321
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,572
- yeah.

322
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:03,073
well, now,

323
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:08,745
we all got things
we want to hide,

324
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:11,665
and we all
just want to be wanted.

325
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:12,958
(chuckles)

326
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,626
oh, and while
you're sleeping tonight,

327
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:16,086
all nice and cozy,

328
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:18,088
look out for them little--
them little critters,

329
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:21,091
because they like to find
a nice little warm spot

330
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,801
to crawl up into, you know--

331
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:23,802
(gibbers wildly)

332
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:26,096
(laughing)

333
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,681
- jesus.

334
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:28,765
- yahoo!

335
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:29,766
(laughs)

336
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,768
- holy shit.

337
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,646
- you just met
some of the local wildlife.

338
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:37,107
his name is meeks--
lives up here on the mountain.

339
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:40,611
pretty sure he's harmless.
- pretty sure?

340
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:42,905
- all right, everybody.
let's get back to the session.

341
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:44,781
- no, no, no, session's over.

342
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,617
you s.t.u.m.p.s needs to get
some shut-eye.

343
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:49,036
0500 comes awfully early
in the morning.

344
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:51,121
- 5:00?
is he crazy?

345
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,831
- move out, s.t.u.m.p.s.

346
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:54,458
let's go.

347
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,793
hit the hay.

348
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,545
- 5:00.

349
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:01,924
i don't even think my clock
has a five on it.

350
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:04,051
- we'll continue this later.

351
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,469
- good night, sister.

352
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,043
- where have you been?
- shh.

353
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:40,087
shut up and fuck me.

354
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,596
- (chuckles)

355
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:13,620
there you go.

356
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,205
yeah.

357
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,623
- (giggles)

00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:05,314
- dad.

536
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:07,357
he's on duty.

537
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:11,361
- i'm just trying to make
the place a little profit.

538
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:14,114
- wish you would've tried that
before you sold me this place.

539
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:16,533
- oh--

540
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,494
- say, mel,
didn't you have a cousin

541
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:20,204
who went to that
first offenders program

542
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:21,497
up there to cutter's peak?

543
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:23,248
- that was a niece, yeah.

544
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:26,335
it's a pretty good program.
really helped her.

545
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:29,796
- i just dropped c.b. off
up there today.

546
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:31,840
well, there's
this female counselor up there--

547
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,550
she seemed all right--
but what do you know

548
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,678
about this instructor,
this sergeant hoke guy?

549
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:39,556
- abner hoke?
that guy's crazy.

550
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:41,183
he ought to be in jail.

551
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:43,393
he killed a kid up there
last year.

552
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:44,895
- killed a kid?
are you serious?

553
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:47,689
- yup.
they worked him to death.

554
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:51,568
- hey, dad, can you go wait
on the other customers?

555
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:53,487
- they already got fresh drinks.

556
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,447
- are these fucking quarters
up there?

557
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:56,490

559
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,704

564

look, a kid got heat stroke,

565
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:19,721
but, you know,
he had a heart condition

566
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:21,932
that no one knew about,
and he's okay now.

567
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:23,934
i'm sure c.b. will be fine.

568
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:25,936

569
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:27,646
maybe you're right.

570
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,773
just being a little
overprotective, i guess.

571
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:33,277
- just a little bit.

572
00:36:33,277 --> 00:36:36,780

i'll see you around.

573

576

to turn a profit.

00:49:53,744 --> 00:49:56,538
- zack, let me see your hand.

716
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,999
- you don't need to see my hand.

717
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:01,752
- you're bleeding.

718
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:07,007
you cut yourself.

719
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,514
(cloth rips)

720
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:33,116
- thank you.

721
00:50:36,328 --> 00:50:38,705
- (yells)

722
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:41,708
(gibbering with fright)

723
00:50:45,462 --> 00:50:46,672
(knocking on door)

724
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:49,800
door--open the door!

725
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,218
- it's meeks.
- let me in!

726
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:52,636
- crazy old guy?

727
00:50:52,636 --> 00:50:54,680
- if he's here,
then maybe the devil is gone.

728
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,724
- get him in.
there's a maniac out there.

729
00:50:57,724 --> 00:50:59,560
- let me in!

730
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,561
oh.

731
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,613
what the hell did you do?

732
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:14,575
- we didn't do anything.

733
00:51:14,575 --> 00:51:17,161
- i'm gonna tell you something.

734
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:19,163
now, you young uns's
been messing with something

735
00:51:19,163 --> 00:51:20,581
you ought not have.

736
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:23,125
now, this--you brought this
on yourself!

737
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:24,710
now, i warned you.

738
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:28,297
now, what the hell did you do?
he's mad as hell.

739
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:30,591
i ain't never seen him
so riled up.

740
00:51:32,593 --> 00:51:33,802
- wait a second.

741
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:40,184
we found this.
- oh.

742
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:45,272
this is bad.

743
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:51,570
now, this is very,
very, very bad.

744
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:16,136
- so tell us
what we're up against.

745
00:52:23,602 --> 00:52:24,603
- well--

746
00:52:24,603 --> 00:52:26,855
(sighs)

747
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:33,153
i guess you heard
all that nonsense about him,

748
00:52:33,153 --> 00:52:39,201
dragging his ax
and making the grand canyon

749
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:46,500
and his footprints
making the great lakes.

750
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,669
- paul bunyan.

751
00:52:48,669 --> 00:52:53,465
you're telling us
that's paul bunyan out there.

752
00:52:53,465 --> 00:52:58,303
- back in late 1800s,

753
00:52:58,303 --> 00:53:00,514
there was a gentleman
by the name

754
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:06,895
of captain larch bunyan.

755
00:53:06,937 --> 00:53:11,567
now, he was a lumber baron
in these parts.

756
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:14,570
he married this woman, helga.

757
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:17,406
she's new in town

758
00:53:17,406 --> 00:53:19,908
and ain't nobody knew
from where.

759
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:24,913
well, helga,
she was ripe with child.

760
00:53:24,955 --> 00:53:26,748
well, she gave birth

761
00:53:26,748 --> 00:53:32,671
to this big,
giant bodacious baby.

762
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:34,798
the doctor said,

763
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:39,595
"well, this child
has a rare disease

764
00:53:39,595 --> 00:53:43,557
or a rare blessing depending
on how you look at it.

765
00:53:43,557 --> 00:53:46,977
"now, he's gonna be at least
twice as big

766
00:53:46,977 --> 00:53:48,937
"as a normal man

767
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:52,441
"and gonna live
three times as long,

768
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:58,447
but he's always gonna have
the mind of a child."

769
00:53:58,489 --> 00:53:59,698
of a child.

770
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:06,955
well, by the time
he was five years old,

771
00:54:06,955 --> 00:54:10,375
he was six-foot-tall,
still growing.

772
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,961
now, young bunyan was working
the lumberyards here

773
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:14,671
in this area.

774
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:18,509
he was--he was bringing down
them big old oak trees

775
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:21,803
with just three whacks
of that ax.

776
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:24,973
of course all the competition
and everything

777
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:26,767
with the lumberjacks,
you know,

778
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:30,896
he won it all at the festivals
and the fairs and whatnot,

779
00:54:30,896 --> 00:54:33,524
you know, hands down.

780
00:54:33,524 --> 00:54:36,276
well,

781
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:39,321
you see, them lumberjacks
had cut down so many trees

782
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:40,989
that the food
was getting scarce.

783
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:44,034
animals were running off
to the high country.

784
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:47,454
now, at this particular camp,
this foreman bill and his men

785
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:49,873
were out hunting for a meal.

786
00:54:51,834 --> 00:54:53,752
well, snow come early
that year,

787
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:56,547
and death was in the air.

788
00:54:56,547 --> 00:54:58,465
now, the men
were following the tracks

789
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:00,926
of this wounded animal
through the snow,

790
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:04,721
and that's when they came upon
bunyan's beloved friend,

791
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:07,349
babe the blue ox.

792
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:09,434
now, babe had wandered off
and stepped himself

793
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:10,769
in a big bear trap.

794
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:12,354
he was maimed, and he was weak,

795
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:14,314
and he couldn't find
his way home.

796
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:18,026
but the loggers, they found him.

797
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:19,403
- there he is,

798
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:22,447
up behind that bush.

799
00:55:22,447 --> 00:55:26,577
- what's he doing way up here?

800
00:55:26,577 --> 00:55:29,580
- he's lost.

801
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:33,083
- no, he's dinner.

802
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:34,710
(babe roars)

803
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:42,801
(roars)

804
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:45,345
- oh, shit!

805
00:55:45,345 --> 00:55:47,556
(guns cock)

806
00:55:47,556 --> 00:55:49,057
- back off.
i got him.

807
00:55:59,485 --> 00:56:00,486
(gunshot)

808
00:56:00,486 --> 00:56:01,737
(babe roars)

809
00:56:03,947 --> 00:56:06,783
- foreman bill shot babe
right between the eyes,

810
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:08,911
killed him deader
than a dinosaur.

811
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:12,080
- elmer, fire up the grill.
we're eating big tonight, buddy.

812
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,540
- right, boss.

813
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:17,836
(indistinct chatter)

814
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:19,671
- bunyan, he went out looking
for babe,

815
00:56:19,671 --> 00:56:22,132
and he found him.

816
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:26,428
and of course, he was too late.

817
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:31,934
- (growls)

818
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:34,645
- the loggers had roasted up
babe's carcass,

819
00:56:34,645 --> 00:56:39,399
and they were feasting on him
like he was a christmas dinner.

820
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:45,697
- (growling)

821
00:56:50,035 --> 00:56:52,538
no.

822
00:56:52,538 --> 00:56:57,125
- so when bunyan saw what
they did to his best friend--

823
00:56:57,167 --> 00:57:00,879
well, the only friend
he'd ever had in whole world--

824
00:57:00,879 --> 00:57:02,756
well, he just went berserk.

825
00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:06,093
he just got that ax
and just sliced them,

826
00:57:06,093 --> 00:57:08,178
every damn one of them
lumberjacks.

827
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:19,982
- (screams)

828
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:23,152
- he killed 10 if he killed 40.

829
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:25,445
whack! whack! whack!

830
00:57:25,445 --> 00:57:26,488
- (screams)

831
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:27,823
- whack! whack!

832
00:57:27,823 --> 00:57:29,032
- (screams)

833
00:57:29,032 --> 00:57:30,951
- whack!
- die!

834
00:57:30,951 --> 00:57:33,495
- whack! whack!

835
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:35,497
- no!

836
00:57:36,874 --> 00:57:40,836
- whack!
why, he just made them kindling.

837
00:57:44,882 --> 00:57:45,841
- (screams)

838
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:46,842
- foreman bill,

839
00:57:46,884 --> 00:57:48,594
oh, he got the worst of it.

840
00:57:50,596 --> 00:57:55,184
cut him such small pieces
that the coyotes had a hard time

841
00:57:55,225 --> 00:57:58,937
trying to find something
to carry away.

842
00:57:58,937 --> 00:58:01,023
when bunyan came to his senses,

843
00:58:01,064 --> 00:58:03,525
he went and hid
until the snow melted,

844
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:05,194
and then he ran and he ran.

845
00:58:05,235 --> 00:58:08,697
but the town-folk,
they hunted him down,

846
00:58:08,697 --> 00:58:09,865
then caught up with him,

847
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:11,575
and they chained him up,

848
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:14,036
and they dragged him
through the town,

849
00:58:14,077 --> 00:58:17,748
back through the streets
for everybody to see.

850
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:24,630
the town-folks,
they spit on him.

851
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:34,097
he was humiliated, embarrassed,
red-faced.

852
00:58:34,097 --> 00:58:36,683
even maybelle,
who bunyan was sweet on,

853
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:39,019
she--she turned away.

854
00:58:41,772 --> 00:58:44,733
- (growling)

855
00:58:47,986 --> 00:58:50,948
- they dragged him
through the forest...

856
00:58:50,948 --> 00:58:52,616
- (screaming)

857
00:58:52,616 --> 00:58:55,744
- tossed bunyan
in an old mine shaft

858
00:58:55,786 --> 00:58:57,538
loaded with dynamite.

859
00:58:57,538 --> 00:58:59,915
one of them lumberjacks
lit a match.

860
00:58:59,957 --> 00:59:01,083
(imitates fuse lighting)

861
00:59:01,124 --> 00:59:02,626
ka-boom!

862
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:06,171
(explosions)

863
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:10,759
sealed that mine shaft forever.

864
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:15,597
well, then they made up
nonsense about...

865
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:17,099
(chuckles)

866
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:20,144
paul bunyan, the lumberjack,

867
00:59:20,144 --> 00:59:23,230
you know, so they can keep
the prosperity going.

868
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:24,815
you know?

869
00:59:24,815 --> 00:59:30,279
well, memories fade.
people die.

870
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,157
people forget.

871
00:59:33,157 --> 00:59:38,245
and you don't know when or who
or what happened back then.

872
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:40,122
(chuckling)

873
00:59:40,122 --> 00:59:41,582
i do.

874
00:59:41,582 --> 00:59:43,625
i always knew.

875
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:47,296
that old mine shaft,
it couldn't hold him.

876
00:59:47,337 --> 00:59:49,298
no, no, no, he escaped.

877
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:52,301
bunyan, he escaped.

878
00:59:52,301 --> 00:59:54,011
he made his way up
into the mountains,

879
00:59:54,011 --> 00:59:56,096
up into the high country,

880
00:59:56,096 --> 00:59:58,932
and he took
babe's sacred remains with him.

881
00:59:58,932 --> 01:00:00,184
and at the top of that mountain,

882
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:03,729
he made a shrine
to his only true friend.

883
01:00:03,729 --> 01:00:06,231
bunyan lived there undisturbed,

884
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:11,153
and he grew and he grew
bigger, bigger,

885
01:00:11,195 --> 01:00:13,655
alone, keeping to himself,

886
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:15,157
keeping away from civilization.

887
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:17,117
he had a pretty good life
up there,

888
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:21,121
that is, until you went
and fouled babe's grave site.

889
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:24,625
you desecrated the resting place

890
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:28,378
of bunyan's only friend.

891
01:00:28,378 --> 01:00:30,005
- so we're stuck here.

892
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:32,382
- hey, ain't nobody going
no place
