1
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:35,647
This is Berk.

2
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:40,187
It's twelve days north of hopeless and a
few degrees south of freezing to death.

3
00:00:40,322 --> 00:00:44,088
It's located solidly
on the meridian of misery.

4
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,689
My village. In a word, sturdy.

5
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,529
It's been here for seven generations,
but every single building is new.

6
00:00:53,668 --> 00:00:57,764
We have fishing, hunting
and a charming view of the sunsets.

7
00:00:57,906 --> 00:01:00,898
The only problems are the pests.

8
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,346
You see, most places
have mice or mosquitoes.

9
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,641
We have...

10
00:01:10,518 --> 00:01:11,951
...dragons.

11
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:15,589
Most people would leave. Not us.

12
00:01:15,724 --> 00:01:19,319
We're Vikings.
We have stubbornness issues.

13
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:22,485
My name is Hiccup.

14
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:26,093
Great name, I know.
But it's not the worst.

15
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:29,931
Parents believe a hideous name
will frighten off gnomes and trolls.

16
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:32,403
Like our charming Viking demeanor
wouldn't do that.

17
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,530
Morning!

18
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:38,576
- What are you doing here?!
- Get inside!

19
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:41,511
- What are you doing out?!
- Get back inside!

20
00:01:44,052 --> 00:01:48,648
Hiccup! What is he doing?
What are you doing out?! Get inside!

21
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,419
That's Stoick the Vast,
chief of the tribe.

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,429
When he was a baby, he popped
a dragon's head clean off its shoulders.

23
00:01:57,565 --> 00:01:59,692
Do I believe it? Yes, I do.

24
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:00,858
What have we got?

25
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:04,802
Gronckles. Nadders. Zipplebacks.
Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.

26
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:08,401
- Any Night Furies?
- None so far.

27
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:09,635
Good.

28
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:11,609
Hoist the torches!

29
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:20,482
Nice of you to join the party!
I thought you'd been carried off!

30
00:02:20,622 --> 00:02:25,457
Who, me? No, come on,
I'm way too muscular for their taste.

31
00:02:25,593 --> 00:02:28,824
They wouldn't know
what to do with all this.

32
00:02:28,963 --> 00:02:30,794
They need toothpicks, don't they?

33
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,199
The meathead with attitude
and interchangeable hands is Gobber.

34
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:39,796
I've been his apprentice
since I was little. Well, littler.

35
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:43,975
Move to the lower defenses.
We'll counterattack with the catapults.

36
00:02:44,112 --> 00:02:45,238
Hurry!

37
00:02:46,347 --> 00:02:49,612
See? Old village,
lots and lots of new houses.

38
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:51,177
Fire!

39
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,581
Let's go!

40
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:57,351
That's Fishlegs, Snotlout, the twins:
Ruffnut and Tuffnut...

41
00:02:57,892 --> 00:02:59,086
...and...

42
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:02,319
...Astrid.

43
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:14,705
Theirjob is so much cooler.

44
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:19,280
Come on. Let me out, please.
I need to make my mark.

45
00:03:19,414 --> 00:03:22,349
You've made plenty of marks,
all in the wrong places.

46
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:24,349
Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon.

47
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:27,683
My life will get infinitely better.
I might even get a date.

48
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:30,518
You can't lift a hammer.
You can't swing an axe.

49
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:32,216
You can't even throw one of these!

50
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:37,554
OK, fine,
but this will throw it for me.

51
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,135
See? Now this right here
is what I'm talking about!

52
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,329
- Mild calibration issue...
- Hiccup!

53
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:47,566
If you ever want to get out there
to fight dragons...

54
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:50,735
...you need to stop all this.

55
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,972
But you just pointed to all of me.

56
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:56,481
Yes, that's it!
Stop being all of you.

57
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,679
Oh, yes.

58
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,550
You, sir,
are playing a dangerous game.

59
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:05,750
Keeping this much
raw Vikingness contained?

60
00:04:05,894 --> 00:04:07,555
There will be consequences!

61
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:11,153
I'll take my chances.
Sword. Sharpen. Now.

62
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:16,934
One day, I'll get out there.
Because killing a dragon...

63
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:18,868
...is everything around here.

64
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:23,577
A Nadder head is sure
to get me at least noticed.

65
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:25,178
Gronckles are tough.

66
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:28,544
Taking down one of those
would definitely get me a girlfriend.

67
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,681
A Zippleback?

68
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,688
Exotic. Two heads, twice the status.

69
00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:36,119
They found the sheep!

70
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:38,418
Concentrate fire over the lower bank.

71
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,221
- Hurry up!
- Fire!

72
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:43,589
And then there's
the Monstrous Nightmare.

73
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:46,666
Only the best Vikings go after those.

74
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:50,737
They have this nasty habit
of setting themselves on fire.

75
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:55,074
Reload! I'll take care of this.

76
00:04:56,511 --> 00:05:00,641
But the ultimate prize
is the dragon no one's ever seen.

77
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:02,773
- We call it the...
- Night Fury!

78
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,282
Get down!

79
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:08,779
Jump!

80
00:05:09,624 --> 00:05:13,321
This thing never steals food,
never shows itself and...

81
00:05:14,796 --> 00:05:16,593
...never misses.

82
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:21,532
No one has ever killed a Night Fury.
That's why I'm going to be the first.

83
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:24,797
Man the fort, Hiccup.
They need me out there.

84
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:29,171
Stay. Put. There.

85
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:32,340
You know what I mean.

86
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:35,976
- Where are you going?
- Yeah, I know!

87
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:37,516
- Hiccup!
- Be right back!

88
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:44,623
Let's get him!

89
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:46,683
Mind yourselves!

90
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:48,819
The devils still have
some juice in them!

91
00:05:58,873 --> 00:06:02,172
Come on. Give me something to
shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.

92
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:27,528
I hit it. Yes, I hit it!

93
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,726
Did anybody see that?

94
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,401
Except for you.

95
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:40,780
- Do not let them escape!
- Right!

96
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:01,194
You're all out.

97
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:09,872
Oh, and there's one more thing
you need to know.

98
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:22,346
Sorry, Dad.

99
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,562
OK, but I hit a Night Fury.

100
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:38,196
It's not like the last few times, Dad!
I really, actually hit it!

101
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:40,637
You guys were busy.
I had a very clear shot.

102
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:44,233
It went down off Raven Point.
Let's get a search party...

103
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:45,707
Stop!

104
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,909
Just stop.

105
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:51,343
Every time you step outside,
disaster follows.

106
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:53,545
Can you not see that
I have bigger problems?

107
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:57,283
Winter is almost here
and I have an entire village to feed!

108
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:02,556
Between you and me, the village
could do with a little less feeding.

109
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:04,631
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

110
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:07,997
Why can't you follow
the simplest orders?

111
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:12,766
I can't stop myself. I see a dragon
and I have to just kill it.

112
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:14,932
It's who I am, Dad.

113
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:20,309
You're many things, Hiccup.
But a dragon killer is not one of them.

114
00:08:20,648 --> 00:08:22,240
Get back to the house.

115
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,380
Make sure he gets there.

116
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:27,186
I have his mess to clean up.

117
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:29,450
Quite the performance.

118
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,423
I've never seen anyone
mess up that badly. That helped.

119
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,188
Thank you, thank you. I was trying.

120
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:40,667
- I really did hit one.
- Sure, Hiccup.

121
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:43,098
- He never listens.
- It runs in the family.

122
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:46,035
When he does,
it's with this disappointed scowl,

123
00:08:46,174 --> 00:08:48,608
like someone skimped on meat
in his sandwich.

124
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:52,804
"Excuse me, barmaid.
You brought me the wrong offspring.

125
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:57,748
I ordered an extra-large boy with beefy
arms, extra guts and glory on the side.

126
00:08:57,885 --> 00:09:00,649
This here, this is a talking fishbone."

127
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:02,881
You're thinking about this wrong.

128
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:07,461
It's not so much what you look like,
it's what's inside that he can't stand.

129
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:10,030
Thank you for summing that up.

130
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:14,425
Look, the point is, stop trying
so hard to be something you're not.

131
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:16,901
I just want to be one of you guys.

132
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:29,973
Either we finish them
or they'll finish us!

133
00:09:30,551 --> 00:09:32,746
It's the only way
we'll be rid of them.

134
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:34,912
If we find the nest and destroy it,

135
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:38,253
the dragons will leave.
They'll find another home!

136
00:09:38,392 --> 00:09:40,917
One more search
before the ice sets in.

137
00:09:41,062 --> 00:09:43,053
Those ships never come back.

138
00:09:43,197 --> 00:09:47,725
We're Vikings. It's an occupational
hazard. Now who's with me?!

139
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:48,858
Count me out.

140
00:09:49,003 --> 00:09:51,130
- Today's no good for me.
- I have to do my axe returns.

141
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:54,400
All right. Those who stay
will look after Hiccup.

142
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,169
- To the ships!
- I'm with you!

143
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,368
That's more like it.

144
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:00,778
I'll pack my undies.

145
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:03,850
No, I need you to stay
and train some new recruits.

146
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:08,445
Perfect. And, while I'm busy,
Hiccup can cover the stall.

147
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:11,786
Molten steel, razor-sharp blades,
lots of time to himself.

148
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:13,917
What could possibly go wrong?

149
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:16,222
What am I going
to do with him, Gobber?

150
00:10:16,364 --> 00:10:17,729
Put him in training.

151
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:20,129
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.

152
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:23,135
He'd be killed before
the first dragon is out of its cage.

153
00:10:23,271 --> 00:10:24,863
- You don't know that.
- I do, actually.

154
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:26,496
- No, you don't.
- No, I do.

155
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:27,869
No, you don't.

156
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:29,806
Listen, you know what he's like.

157
00:10:29,944 --> 00:10:33,880
From the time he could crawl,
he's been... different.

158
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:38,550
He doesn't listen. He has
the attention span of a sparrow.

159
00:10:39,186 --> 00:10:42,246
I take him fishing
and he goes hunting for trolls!

160
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,950
Trolls exist. They steal your socks.

161
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:48,118
But only the left ones.
What's with that?

162
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:49,559
- When I was a boy...
- Here we go.

163
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:52,598
...my father told me to bang
my head against a rock and I did it.

164
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:55,566
I thought it was crazy,
but I didn't question him.

165
00:10:55,703 --> 00:10:57,898
- And you know what happened?
- You got a headache.

166
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:00,007
That rock split in two.

167
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:03,270
It taught me what
a Viking could do, Gobber.

168
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:07,404
He could crush mountains,
level forests, tame seas!

169
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:12,614
Even as a boy, I knew what I was,
what I had to become.

170
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:15,322
Hiccup is not that boy.

171
00:11:15,456 --> 00:11:17,788
You can't stop him, Stoick.

172
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:20,120
You can only prepare him.

173
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:24,459
I know it seems hopeless, but you won't
always be around to protect him.

174
00:11:24,632 --> 00:11:28,728
He's going to get out there again.
He's probably out there now.

175
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:49,216
Oh, the gods hate me.

176
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:52,554
Some people lose their knife
or their mug. Not me.

177
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:55,685
I manage to lose an entire dragon.

178
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:47,176
Oh, wow. I did it.

179
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:51,311
I did it. This fixes everything! Yes!

180
00:12:51,452 --> 00:12:53,784
I have brought down
this mighty beast!

181
00:13:22,183 --> 00:13:24,174
I'm going to kill you, dragon.

182
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:28,588
Then I'll cut out your heart
and take it to my father.

183
00:13:28,923 --> 00:13:32,051
I am a Viking. I am a Viking!

184
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,194
I did this.

185
00:15:22,503 --> 00:15:23,492
Hiccup.

186
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:25,403
Dad...

187
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:28,065
...I have to talk to you, Dad.

188
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:30,404
I need to speak with you, too, son.

189
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:34,344
- I don't want to fight dragons.
- It's time you learn to fight dragons.

190
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:35,470
- What?
- What?

191
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:38,346
- You go first.
- No, you go first.

192
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:39,543
All right.

193
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:44,090
You get your wish. Dragon training...
you start in the morning.

194
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:46,284
Oh, man, I should have gone first.

195
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:48,190
I was thinking, you know,

196
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:51,355
we have a surplus
of dragon-fighting Vikings,

197
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:56,162
but do we have enough bread-making
Vikings or small-home-repair Vikings?

198
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:57,292
You'll need this.

199
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:59,633
I don't want to fight dragons.

200
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,232
Come on. Yes, you do.

201
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:05,311
Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.

202
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:07,243
But you will kill dragons.

203
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:10,407
No, I'm really very extra-sure
that I won't.

204
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:12,451
- It's time, Hiccup.
- Can you not hear me?

205
00:16:12,586 --> 00:16:14,781
This is serious, son.

206
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:20,223
When you carry this axe,
you carry all of us with you.

207
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:24,058
Which means you walk like us,
you talk like us...

208
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:26,063
...you think like us.

209
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,426
No more of... this.

210
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:30,537
You just gestured to all of me.

211
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:34,032
- Deal?
- This conversation is very one-sided.

212
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:35,471
Deal?

213
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:38,470
Deal.

214
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,069
Good.

215
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:43,950
Train hard.

216
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:46,615
I'll be back. Probably.

217
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:49,345
And I'll be here.

218
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,157
Maybe.

219
00:16:53,027 --> 00:16:54,619
Welcome to dragon training!

220
00:16:55,562 --> 00:16:57,223
No turning back.

221
00:17:14,615 --> 00:17:16,515
I hope I get some serious burns.

222
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,279
I'm hoping for some mauling,
like on my shoulder or back.

223
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:22,685
Yeah, it's only fun if you get
a scar out of it.

224
00:17:22,823 --> 00:17:24,085
Yeah, no kidding, right?

225
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:26,288
Pain. Love it.

226
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:28,156
Oh, great. Who let him in?

227
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:31,059
Let's get started!
The recruit who does best

228
00:17:31,198 --> 00:17:33,826
will win the honor
of killing his first dragon

229
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:35,697
in front of the entire village.

230
00:17:35,836 --> 00:17:40,398
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury,
so does that disqualify him?

231
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,032
Can I transfer to the class
with the cool Vikings?

232
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:47,204
Don't worry. You're small and weak...
that'll make you less of a target.

233
00:17:47,348 --> 00:17:49,145
They'll see you as sick or insane

234
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:52,480
and go after the more
Viking-like teens instead.

235
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:56,214
Behind these doors
are just a few of the many species

236
00:17:56,357 --> 00:17:57,346
you will learn to fight!

237
00:17:57,491 --> 00:18:00,016
- The Deadly Nadder!
- Speed 8, armor 16.

238
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,525
The Hideous Zippleback.

239
00:18:01,662 --> 00:18:03,061
Plus 11 stealth. Times 2.

240
00:18:03,197 --> 00:18:05,222
- The Monstrous Nightmare.
- Firepower 15.

241
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:07,425
- The Terrible Terror.
- Attack 8, venom 12.

242
00:18:07,568 --> 00:18:09,297
Can you stop that?!

243
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:12,337
And the Gronckle.

244
00:18:12,473 --> 00:18:14,566
Jaw strength 8.

245
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,232
Wait, aren't you gonna teach us first?

246
00:18:16,377 --> 00:18:18,902
I believe in learning on the job.

247
00:18:20,647 --> 00:18:23,707
Today is about survival.
If you get blasted...

248
00:18:24,518 --> 00:18:26,042
...you're dead!

249
00:18:26,186 --> 00:18:27,847
What's the first thing you'll need?

250
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:29,717
- A doctor?
- Plus 5 speed?

251
00:18:30,057 --> 00:18:32,116
- A shield.
- Shields. Go!

252
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:35,591
Your most important piece of equipment
is your shield!

253
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:39,722
If you must choose between
a sword or a shield, take the shield!

254
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:41,965
- Let go of my shield!
- There are a million shields!

255
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:44,127
Take that one. It has a flower...
girls like flowers.

256
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:46,465
Oops, this one has blood on it.

257
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,577
- Tuffnut, Ruffnut! You're out!
- What?

258
00:18:50,711 --> 00:18:52,406
Shields are good for another thing.

259
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:56,812
Noise! Make lots of it
to throw off a dragon's aim!

260
00:18:58,152 --> 00:19:00,620
All dragons have
a limited number of shots.

261
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:03,018
How many does a Gronckle have?

262
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:04,488
- Five?
- No, six!

263
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,752
Correct, six!
That's one for each of you!

264
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:09,329
Fishlegs, out!

265
00:19:09,463 --> 00:19:11,488
Hiccup, get in there!

266
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:17,764
I moved into my parents' basement.
Come by sometime and work out.

267
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:19,605
You look like you work out.

268
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,674
Snotlout! You're done!

269
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:23,436
So it's just you and me, huh?

270
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:25,236
Nope, just you.

271
00:19:26,246 --> 00:19:28,111
One shot left!

272
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,508
Hiccup!

273
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:40,524
And that's six.

274
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:43,729
Go back to bed,
you overgrown sausage!

275
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,464
You'll get another chance,
don't you worry.

276
00:19:48,602 --> 00:19:51,594
Remember, a dragon will always,

277
00:19:51,872 --> 00:19:55,330
always go for the kill.

278
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:04,550
So... why didn't you?

279
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:33,575
This was stupid.

280
00:21:16,857 --> 00:21:19,792
Why don't you just fly away?

281
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:58,657
All right, where did Astrid go wrong
in the ring today?

282
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,563
I mistimed my somersault dive.
It was sloppy.

283
00:22:01,702 --> 00:22:04,296
- It threw off my reverse tumble.
- Yeah, we noticed.

284
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:06,497
No, no, you were great.
That was so "Astrid."

285
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,200
She's right. You have to be
tough on yourselves.

286
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:11,106
Where did Hiccup go wrong?

287
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:13,770
- He showed up.
- He didn't get eaten.

288
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:15,677
He's never where he should be.

289
00:22:15,816 --> 00:22:17,716
Thank you, Astrid.

290
00:22:17,985 --> 00:22:22,445
You need to live and breathe
this stuff. The dragon manual.

291
00:22:23,323 --> 00:22:26,850
Everything we know about
every dragon we know of.

292
00:22:29,463 --> 00:22:31,454
No attacks tonight. Study up.

293
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:33,259
Wait, you mean read?

294
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,662
While we're still alive?

295
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:36,769
Why read words
when you can just kill the stuff

296
00:22:36,903 --> 00:22:38,598
the words tell you stuff about?

297
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:41,674
I've read it seven times.
There's this water dragon

298
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:45,107
that sprays boiling water at your
face. And there's this other one...

299
00:22:45,545 --> 00:22:46,978
Yeah. That sounds great.

300
00:22:47,114 --> 00:22:50,345
- There was a chance I'd read it...
- But now...

301
00:22:50,484 --> 00:22:52,076
You guys read. I'll go kill stuff.

302
00:22:52,486 --> 00:22:55,421
Another one has spines like trees.

303
00:22:55,555 --> 00:22:57,716
- So I guess we'll share?
- Read it.

304
00:22:57,991 --> 00:23:02,690
All mine, then. Wow.
So, OK, I'll see you...

305
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:04,463
...tomorrow.

306
00:23:14,574 --> 00:23:16,474
Dragon classifications.

307
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,875
Strike class.
Fear class. Mystery class.

308
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:25,582
Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon
inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.

309
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:28,745
When startled, the Thunderdrum
produces a concussive sound

310
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:30,652
that can kill a man at close range.

311
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:33,760
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

312
00:23:33,894 --> 00:23:37,762
Timberjack. This gigantic creature
has razor-sharp wings

313
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:39,866
that can slice through full-grown trees.

314
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,026
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

315
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:48,005
Scauldron. Sprays scalding water
at its victim. Extremely dangerous.

316
00:23:53,947 --> 00:23:58,111
Changewing. Even newly hatched
dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight.

317
00:23:58,418 --> 00:24:01,945
Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill.

318
00:24:02,422 --> 00:24:05,585
Bone Knapper. Whispering Death.

319
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,794
Burns its victims. Buries its victims.

320
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:11,864
Chokes its victims.
Turns its victims inside out.

321
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:14,862
Extremely dangerous.
Extremely dangerous.

322
00:24:15,135 --> 00:24:18,730
Kill on sight.
Kill on sight. Kill on sight.

323
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,939
Night Fury.

324
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:26,136
Speed unknown. Size unknown.

325
00:24:26,613 --> 00:24:30,811
The unholy offspring
of lightning and death itself.

326
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:32,748
Never engage this dragon.

327
00:24:32,886 --> 00:24:37,050
Your only chance: Hide and pray
it does not find you.

328
00:24:51,004 --> 00:24:52,972
I can almost smell them.

329
00:24:53,106 --> 00:24:54,733
They're close.

330
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:57,208
Steady.

331
00:25:07,954 --> 00:25:09,216
Take us in.

332
00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:12,153
Hard to port. For Helheim's Gate.

333
00:25:12,492 --> 00:25:14,153
Hard to port!

334
00:25:17,998 --> 00:25:19,659
Steady!

335
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:36,177
Hey, you know, I just happened to notice
the book had nothing on Night Furies.

336
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,978
Is there another book, or a sequel?
Maybe a Night Fury pamphlet?

337
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:45,381
Focus, Hiccup!
You're not even trying!

338
00:25:47,127 --> 00:25:50,255
Today it's all about attack!

339
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,164
Nadders are quick and light
on their feet.

340
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,030
Your job is to be quicker and lighter!

341
00:25:58,305 --> 00:26:01,069
I'm really beginning to question
your teaching methods!

342
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,676
Look for its blind spot!
Every dragon has one.

343
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,745
Find it, hide in it and strike!

344
00:26:08,281 --> 00:26:09,680
Do you ever bathe?

345
00:26:09,816 --> 00:26:12,444
If you don't like it, then
just get your own blind spot.

346
00:26:12,586 --> 00:26:14,554
How about I give you one?

347
00:26:16,223 --> 00:26:19,124
Blind spot, yes.
Deaf spot, not so much.

348
00:26:20,126 --> 00:26:23,027
Hey, so, how would one sneak up
on a Night Fury?

349
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:26,690
No one's ever met one and lived
to tell the tale. Get in there!

350
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,199
- I know, I know, but hypothetically...
- Hiccup!

351
00:26:29,336 --> 00:26:30,667
Get down.

352
00:26:44,818 --> 00:26:46,809
Watch out, babe.
I'll take care of this.

353
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:50,821
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.

354
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:52,989
What do you want me to do,
block out the sun?

355
00:26:53,126 --> 00:26:55,060
I could do that but I don't have time!

356
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:57,026
They probably...

357
00:26:57,163 --> 00:27:00,997
...take the daytime off, right?
Like a cat.

358
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:03,261
Has anyone ever seen one napping?

359
00:27:03,737 --> 00:27:04,863
Hiccup!

360
00:27:06,273 --> 00:27:07,604
Hiccup!

361
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,608
Love on the battlefield.

362
00:27:12,746 --> 00:27:13,838
She could do better.

363
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,607
Let me... Why don't you?

364
00:27:25,058 --> 00:27:26,389
Well done, Astrid.

365
00:27:28,395 --> 00:27:31,125
Is this some kind of a joke to you?

366
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:34,393
Our parents' war
is about to become ours.

367
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:36,729
Figure out which side you're on.

368
00:28:58,184 --> 00:29:00,049
Toothless.

369
00:29:00,186 --> 00:29:02,416
I could have sworn you had...

370
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,748
...teeth.

371
00:29:10,964 --> 00:29:11,988
No, no, no.

372
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:15,366
I don't have any more!

373
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:13,072
And with one twist, he took my hand
and swallowed it whole!

374
00:33:13,072 --> 00:33:16,200
And with one twist, he took my hand
and swallowed it whole!

375
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:19,505
I saw the look on his face...
I was delicious.

376
00:33:19,646 --> 00:33:20,943
He must have passed the word,

377
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,641
because it wasn't a month before
another one of them took my leg.

378
00:33:25,518 --> 00:33:28,510
Isn't it weird to think
your hand was inside a dragon?

379
00:33:28,655 --> 00:33:30,885
Like if your mind was still
in control of it,

380
00:33:31,024 --> 00:33:34,585
you could have killed the dragon
from inside by crushing his heart.

381
00:33:34,727 --> 00:33:39,528
I swear, I'm so angry. I'll avenge your
beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.

382
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:43,659
I'll chop off the legs of every dragon
I fight, with my face.

383
00:33:45,138 --> 00:33:47,368
It's the wings and the tails
you really want.

384
00:33:47,507 --> 00:33:49,975
If it can't fly, it can't get away.

385
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:53,408
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.

386
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:59,279
All right, I'm off to bed.
You should be, too.

387
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:02,718
Tomorrow we get to the big boys,
slowly but surely

388
00:34:02,855 --> 00:34:06,086
making our way up
to the Monstrous Nightmare.

389
00:34:06,225 --> 00:34:08,750
But who'll win the honor of killing it?

390
00:34:08,895 --> 00:34:12,160
It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See?

391
00:34:12,298 --> 00:34:14,425
Your mom let you get a tattoo?

392
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:16,296
It's not a tattoo, it's a birthmark.

393
00:34:16,436 --> 00:34:20,236
OK, I've been stuck with you since
birth, and that was never there before.

394
00:34:20,373 --> 00:34:23,171
Yes, it was. You've just never
seen me from the left side.

395
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:06,447
Hey, Toothless.

396
00:35:06,586 --> 00:35:10,386
I brought breakfast. I hope...
I hope you're hungry.

397
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:13,515
OK, that's disgusting.

398
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:17,490
We've got some salmon,
some nice Icelandic cod...

399
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,791
...and a whole smoked eel.

400
00:35:25,171 --> 00:35:28,140
No, no, no, no, no!
No, it's OK.

401
00:35:28,674 --> 00:35:30,869
Yeah, I don't really like
eel much, either.

402
00:35:34,514 --> 00:35:35,811
That's it.

403
00:35:36,549 --> 00:35:38,676
That's it.
Just stick with the good stuff.

404
00:35:39,152 --> 00:35:42,815
And don't you mind me.
I'll just be back here,

405
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:45,814
minding my own business.

406
00:35:58,304 --> 00:35:59,566
It's OK.

407
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:10,909
OK.

408
00:36:25,331 --> 00:36:26,662
That's not too bad. It works.

409
00:36:32,205 --> 00:36:34,196
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

410
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,741
Oh, my! It's working!

411
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:54,824
Yes, yes! I did it!

412
00:37:07,106 --> 00:37:08,130
Yeah!

413
00:37:08,274 --> 00:37:10,242
Today is about teamwork.

414
00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:16,441
Now, a wet dragon head
can't light its fire.

415
00:37:16,716 --> 00:37:20,584
The Hideous Zippleback
is extra tricky.

416
00:37:20,853 --> 00:37:24,186
One head breathes gas,
the other head lights it.

417
00:37:25,391 --> 00:37:28,189
Your job is to know which is which.

418
00:37:28,327 --> 00:37:31,524
Razor-sharp serrated teeth
that inject venom for pre-digestion.

419
00:37:31,664 --> 00:37:34,030
Prefers ambush attack,
crushing its victims...

420
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:35,464
Will you please stop that?!

421
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:43,607
If that dragon shows
either of his faces, I'm gonna...

422
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:44,937
There!

423
00:37:45,878 --> 00:37:48,472
Hey, it's us, idiots!

424
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:51,344
Your butts are getting bigger.
We thought you were a dragon.

425
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:54,884
Not that there's anything wrong
with a dragonesque figure.

426
00:37:58,624 --> 00:37:59,613
Wait.

427
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:04,892
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

428
00:38:05,031 --> 00:38:07,898
Chances of survival are
dwindling to single digits now.

429
00:38:15,508 --> 00:38:16,907
Wrong head.

430
00:38:17,543 --> 00:38:18,532
Fishlegs!

431
00:38:21,747 --> 00:38:22,736
Now, Hiccup!

432
00:38:25,751 --> 00:38:27,651
Oh, come on.

433
00:38:32,325 --> 00:38:33,656
Hiccup!

434
00:38:35,394 --> 00:38:37,919
Back, back, back!

435
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:42,762
Now, don't you make me tell you again!
Yes, that's right.

436
00:38:42,902 --> 00:38:46,736
Back into your cage.
Now think about what you've done.

437
00:38:56,749 --> 00:39:01,812
OK, so are we done? 'Cause I've got
some things I need to...

438
00:39:02,421 --> 00:39:04,685
Yep, I'll see you tomorrow!

439
00:39:56,809 --> 00:39:58,777
I've never seen a Gronckle do that.

440
00:39:58,911 --> 00:40:03,780
I left my axe back in the ring. You guys
go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.

441
00:40:43,556 --> 00:40:45,956
Meet the Terrible Terror.

442
00:40:48,194 --> 00:40:49,422
It's like the size of my...

443
00:40:50,796 --> 00:40:51,956
Get it off!

444
00:40:52,531 --> 00:40:55,466
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

445
00:40:58,237 --> 00:41:00,535
Wow! He's better than you ever were.

446
00:41:45,217 --> 00:41:46,775
Oh, great.

447
00:41:47,853 --> 00:41:48,911
Hiccup.

448
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,401
Hiccup? Are you in there?

449
00:42:08,174 --> 00:42:09,573
Astrid. Hey.

450
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:12,302
Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid.

451
00:42:12,445 --> 00:42:15,380
I normally don't care what people do,
but you're acting weird.

452
00:42:16,982 --> 00:42:18,244
Well, weirder.

453
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:50,643
- I trust you found the nest, at least?
- Not even close.

454
00:42:50,783 --> 00:42:51,807
Excellent.

455
00:42:51,951 --> 00:42:54,181
I hope you had more success than me.

456
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,654
Well, if by success, you mean that
your parenting troubles are over, yes.

457
00:42:58,858 --> 00:43:02,191
Congratulations, Stoick!
Everyone is so relieved!

458
00:43:02,328 --> 00:43:04,489
Out with the old and
in with the new, right?

459
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,997
- No one will miss that nuisance!
- We're throwing a party to celebrate!

460
00:43:08,567 --> 00:43:09,727
- Come over here.
- Hurry!

461
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:10,858
He's gone?

462
00:43:13,072 --> 00:43:17,008
Most afternoons, but who can blame
him? The life of a celebrity's rough.

463
00:43:17,142 --> 00:43:20,976
He can barely walk through the village
without being swarmed by his new fans.

464
00:43:21,113 --> 00:43:22,102
Hiccup?

465
00:43:22,248 --> 00:43:26,344
Who would have thought it?
He has this way with the beasts.

466
00:43:34,593 --> 00:43:38,222
OK, bud.
We're gonna take this nice and slow.

467
00:43:38,364 --> 00:43:40,127
Here we go. Here we go. Position...

468
00:43:40,799 --> 00:43:42,790
...three... no, four.

469
00:44:02,054 --> 00:44:04,682
All right, it's go time. It's go time.

470
00:44:10,796 --> 00:44:12,696
Come on, buddy! Come on, buddy!

471
00:44:20,706 --> 00:44:22,298
Yes, it worked!

472
00:44:26,979 --> 00:44:28,241
Sorry!

473
00:44:30,716 --> 00:44:31,910
It was my fault.

474
00:44:33,118 --> 00:44:35,245
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. Position four.

475
00:44:35,754 --> 00:44:36,743
Three.

476
00:44:39,992 --> 00:44:41,983
Yeah! Go, baby!

477
00:44:42,728 --> 00:44:43,752
Yes!

478
00:44:43,896 --> 00:44:48,094
Oh, this is amazing!
The wind in my... cheat sheet!

479
00:44:48,233 --> 00:44:49,723
Stop!

480
00:44:52,438 --> 00:44:53,735
No!

481
00:44:56,842 --> 00:45:00,209
Oh, gosh! Oh, gods! Oh, no!

482
00:45:00,613 --> 00:45:03,776
All right, OK, you've gotta
kind of angle yourself.

483
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:06,714
OK, no, no, no. Come back down
towards me! Come back down...

484
00:45:48,527 --> 00:45:50,154
Yeah!

485
00:45:51,997 --> 00:45:53,089
Come on.

486
00:46:02,141 --> 00:46:04,075
No, thanks. I'm good.

487
00:46:41,113 --> 00:46:44,241
Not so fireproof
on the inside, are you?

488
00:46:44,383 --> 00:46:45,509
Here you go.

489
00:47:02,067 --> 00:47:06,197
Everything we know
about you guys is wrong.

490
00:47:16,415 --> 00:47:19,407
Dad! You're back!
Gobber's not here so...

491
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,540
I know.

492
00:47:23,155 --> 00:47:26,022
- I came looking for you.
- You did?

493
00:47:26,158 --> 00:47:27,625
You've been keeping secrets.

494
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,393
I have?

495
00:47:29,528 --> 00:47:32,156
Just how long did you think
you could hide it?

496
00:47:32,297 --> 00:47:35,027
I don't know what you're...

497
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:39,570
Nothing happens on this island
without me hearing about it.

498
00:47:40,372 --> 00:47:41,634
So...

499
00:47:42,374 --> 00:47:44,308
...let's talk...

500
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:46,377
...about that dragon.

501
00:47:46,512 --> 00:47:50,642
Oh, gods. Dad, I'm so sorry.
I was going to tell you.

502
00:47:50,983 --> 00:47:53,247
I just didn't know how to...

503
00:47:58,056 --> 00:48:00,217
You're not upset?

504
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:02,953
What?! I was hoping for this!

505
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:06,559
- You were?
- And believe me, it only gets better!

506
00:48:06,698 --> 00:48:09,462
Wait till you spill
a Nadder's guts the first time!

507
00:48:09,601 --> 00:48:12,331
And mount your first
Gronckle head on a spear!

508
00:48:12,471 --> 00:48:16,305
What a feeling!
You really had me going there, son!

509
00:48:16,441 --> 00:48:20,639
All those years of the worst Viking
Berk has ever seen.

510
00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:24,112
Odin, it was rough.
I almost gave up on you.

511
00:48:24,249 --> 00:48:26,513
And all the while
you were holding out on me!

512
00:48:26,652 --> 00:48:28,517
Oh, Thor Almighty!

513
00:48:30,322 --> 00:48:32,722
With you doing so well in the ring...

514
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:36,721
...we finally have something
to talk about.

515
00:48:50,442 --> 00:48:54,037
Here, I brought you something,

516
00:48:54,313 --> 00:48:57,043
to keep you safe in the ring.

517
00:48:57,182 --> 00:48:59,309
Wow. Thanks.

518
00:48:59,451 --> 00:49:04,320
Your mother would have wanted you to
have it. It's half of her breastplate.

519
00:49:05,924 --> 00:49:09,724
Matching set.
It keeps her close, you know.

520
00:49:10,462 --> 00:49:15,456
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.
You've held up your end of the deal.

521
00:49:21,073 --> 00:49:25,476
- I should really get to bed.
- Yes, good. OK, good talk.

522
00:49:25,611 --> 00:49:28,045
- I'll see you back at the house. Great.
- We should do this again.

523
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,408
Thanks for stopping by...

524
00:49:29,548 --> 00:49:32,608
...and for the breast hat.
- I hope you like the hat.

525
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,485
Well... Yep. Good night.

526
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:54,462
Stay out of my way!
I'm winning this thing.

527
00:49:54,606 --> 00:49:57,336
Please, by all means.

528
00:50:09,388 --> 00:50:11,481
This time, this time for sure!

529
00:50:20,299 --> 00:50:23,097
No! No, son of a half-troll,

530
00:50:23,235 --> 00:50:26,261
- rat-eating, munge-bucket!
- Wait, wait.

531
00:50:26,405 --> 00:50:28,270
- So, later.
- Not so fast.

532
00:50:28,407 --> 00:50:30,398
- I'm kind of late for...
- What?!

533
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:33,102
Late for what, exactly?

534
00:50:33,245 --> 00:50:36,078
Quiet down! The elder has decided.

535
00:50:47,526 --> 00:50:51,758
You've done it, Hiccup!
You get to kill the dragon!

536
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:56,261
That's my boy!

537
00:50:56,401 --> 00:51:00,132
Yeah. Yes. I can't wait. I am so...

538
00:51:00,272 --> 00:51:02,240
...leaving! We're leaving.

539
00:51:02,374 --> 00:51:06,811
Let's pack up. Looks like you and me
are taking a little vacation.

540
00:51:07,279 --> 00:51:08,541
Forever.

541
00:51:11,283 --> 00:51:12,807
Oh, man.

542
00:51:14,786 --> 00:51:17,846
What the?!
What are you doing here?

543
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:21,158
I want to know what's going on.

544
00:51:21,293 --> 00:51:25,423
No one just gets as good as you do.
Especially you.

545
00:51:25,564 --> 00:51:28,431
Start talking!
Are you training with someone?

546
00:51:28,567 --> 00:51:29,625
Training?

547
00:51:29,768 --> 00:51:31,429
It better not involve this.

548
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:35,165
I know this looks really bad,
but you see...

549
00:51:37,576 --> 00:51:39,567
You're right. You're right.
You're right.

550
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:44,842
I'm through with the lies.
I've been making outfits. So you got me.

551
00:51:45,183 --> 00:51:49,142
It's time everyone knew.
Drag me back, go ahead. Here we go.

552
00:51:49,721 --> 00:51:51,313
Why would you do that?!

553
00:51:51,456 --> 00:51:55,859
That's for the lies.
And that's for everything else.

554
00:51:56,661 --> 00:51:57,650
Oh, man.

555
00:51:59,131 --> 00:52:00,120
Get down!

556
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,465
Run, run!

557
00:52:06,104 --> 00:52:07,867
It's OK! It's OK.

558
00:52:08,206 --> 00:52:09,605
She's a friend.

559
00:52:11,743 --> 00:52:13,108
You just scared him.

560
00:52:13,245 --> 00:52:14,735
I scared him?!

561
00:52:15,747 --> 00:52:17,374
Who is "him"?

562
00:52:18,483 --> 00:52:22,476
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.

563
00:52:28,593 --> 00:52:29,753
We're dead.

564
00:52:30,762 --> 00:52:32,889
Where do you think you're going?

565
00:52:39,037 --> 00:52:41,904
Oh, great Odin's ghost! This is it!

566
00:52:52,784 --> 00:52:55,184
Hiccup, get me down from here!

567
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,481
You have to give me a chance to explain.

568
00:52:57,622 --> 00:53:00,352
I am not listening
to anything you have to say!

569
00:53:00,492 --> 00:53:03,928
Then I won't speak.
Just let me show you.

570
00:53:05,464 --> 00:53:06,863
Please, Astrid.

571
00:53:22,814 --> 00:53:23,940
Now get me down.

572
00:53:24,082 --> 00:53:26,812
Toothless, down. Gently.

573
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,350
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

574
00:53:34,759 --> 00:53:36,226
Toothless!

575
00:53:37,229 --> 00:53:40,221
What is wrong with you?! Bad dragon!

576
00:53:41,366 --> 00:53:44,233
He's not usually like this.
Oh, no.

577
00:53:49,774 --> 00:53:52,902
Toothless, what are you doing?
We need her to like us!

578
00:53:55,914 --> 00:53:57,905
And now the spinning.

579
00:53:58,783 --> 00:54:01,946
Thank you for nothing,
you useless reptile.

580
00:54:02,687 --> 00:54:05,679
OK, I am sorry! I'm sorry.

581
00:54:05,991 --> 00:54:07,686
Just get me off of this thing.

582
00:55:54,399 --> 00:55:58,096
All right, I admit it.
This is pretty cool.

583
00:55:58,436 --> 00:56:00,996
It's amazing.

584
00:56:01,339 --> 00:56:02,863
He's amazing.

585
00:56:05,543 --> 00:56:07,670
So what now?

586
00:56:07,812 --> 00:56:10,679
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow.

587
00:56:10,949 --> 00:56:12,940
You know you'll have to kill...

588
00:56:13,551 --> 00:56:14,677
...kill a dragon.

589
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:16,548
Don't remind me.

590
00:56:17,689 --> 00:56:19,088
Toothless, what's happening?

591
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:22,958
What is it?

592
00:56:25,764 --> 00:56:26,822
Get down!

593
00:56:44,115 --> 00:56:45,912
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

594
00:56:46,051 --> 00:56:49,020
Toothless, you gotta get us
out of here, bud.

595
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:53,989
It looks like
they're hauling in their kill.

596
00:56:54,959 --> 00:56:56,722
What does that make us?

597
00:57:39,637 --> 00:57:42,128
What my dad wouldn't give
to find this.

598
00:57:59,057 --> 00:58:02,515
It's satisfying to know that all of
our food has been dumped down a hole.

599
00:58:03,194 --> 00:58:05,526
They're not eating any of it.

600
00:58:21,012 --> 00:58:22,604
What is that?

601
00:58:29,754 --> 00:58:32,746
All right, bud,
we got to get out of here... now!

602
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:45,967
It totally makes sense.
It's like a giant beehive.

603
00:58:46,104 --> 00:58:48,129
They're the workers
and that's their queen.

604
00:58:48,273 --> 00:58:50,833
It controls them. Let's find your dad.

605
00:58:50,975 --> 00:58:52,237
No! No.

606
00:58:52,577 --> 00:58:56,673
No, not yet. They'll kill Toothless.

607
00:58:56,815 --> 00:58:59,579
We have to think this through
carefully.

608
00:58:59,717 --> 00:59:02,652
Hiccup, we just discovered
the dragons' nest,

609
00:59:02,787 --> 00:59:05,551
the thing we've been after
since Vikings first sailed here,

610
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:07,988
and you want to keep it a secret?

611
00:59:08,126 --> 00:59:11,061
To protect your pet dragon?
Are you serious?

612
00:59:13,198 --> 00:59:14,392
Yes.

613
00:59:21,873 --> 00:59:24,398
OK. Then what do we do?

614
00:59:24,542 --> 00:59:28,273
Just give me until tomorrow.
I'll figure something out.

615
00:59:29,013 --> 00:59:30,207
OK.

616
00:59:31,749 --> 00:59:33,011
That's for kidnapping me.

617
00:59:40,024 --> 00:59:42,754
That's for everything else.

618
00:59:51,936 --> 00:59:53,927
What are you looking at?

619
00:59:54,672 --> 00:59:58,802
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

620
01:00:01,646 --> 01:00:05,013
I can show my face in public again!

621
01:00:07,352 --> 01:00:10,480
If someone had told me
that in a few short weeks

622
01:00:10,622 --> 01:00:15,218
Hiccup would go from, well,
being Hiccup

623
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:19,888
to placing first in dragon training,
well, I would have tied him to a mast

624
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:22,625
and shipped him off
for fear he'd gone mad!

625
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:24,632
And you know it!

626
01:00:27,105 --> 01:00:31,599
But here we are.
And no one is more surprised

627
01:00:31,743 --> 01:00:34,769
or more proud than I am.

628
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,716
Today, my boy becomes a Viking.

629
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:42,047
Today, he becomes one of us!

630
01:00:46,057 --> 01:00:47,957
Be careful with that dragon.

631
01:00:48,092 --> 01:00:51,550
- It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
- What are you going to do?

632
01:00:51,696 --> 01:00:54,790
Put an end to this. I have to try.

633
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,936
Astrid, if something goes wrong,

634
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:01,095
just make sure
they don't find Toothless.

635
01:01:01,806 --> 01:01:05,333
I will. Just promise me
it won't go wrong.

636
01:01:06,077 --> 01:01:09,342
It's time, Hiccup. Knock 'em dead.

637
01:01:14,886 --> 01:01:17,377
Yeah! Show 'em how it's done.

638
01:01:17,522 --> 01:01:20,753
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

639
01:01:33,271 --> 01:01:34,795
I would have gone for the hammer.

640
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,137
I'm ready.

641
01:02:04,202 --> 01:02:06,796
Go on, Hiccup. Give it to him!

642
01:02:11,242 --> 01:02:12,573
What is he doing?

643
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:17,974
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.

644
01:02:25,857 --> 01:02:27,017
I'm not one of them.

645
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:33,424
What's he thinking?

646
01:02:33,998 --> 01:02:35,465
- Stop the fight.
- No!

647
01:02:35,933 --> 01:02:38,333
I need you all to see this.

648
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:41,397
They're not what we think they are.

649
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,539
We don't have to kill them.

650
01:02:45,076 --> 01:02:47,271
I said, stop the fight!

651
01:02:54,819 --> 01:02:56,013
Out of my way!

652
01:02:56,287 --> 01:02:57,345
Hiccup!

653
01:03:18,209 --> 01:03:19,335
Hiccup!

654
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:27,412
This way!

655
01:03:47,805 --> 01:03:49,033
Night Fury!

656
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:09,422
Toothless, go. Get out of here.

657
01:04:11,629 --> 01:04:12,857
Go, go!

658
01:04:12,997 --> 01:04:13,986
Stoick, no!

659
01:04:14,132 --> 01:04:15,531
Dad, he won't hurt you!

660
01:04:16,534 --> 01:04:19,560
No, don't!
You're only making it worse!

661
01:04:20,705 --> 01:04:21,694
Toothless, stop!

662
01:04:23,474 --> 01:04:25,305
No! No!

663
01:04:28,946 --> 01:04:29,935
Get him!

664
01:04:33,551 --> 01:04:35,542
No, no! Please just don't hurt him!

665
01:04:36,254 --> 01:04:37,653
Please don't hurt him.

666
01:04:44,629 --> 01:04:46,119
Put it with the others.

667
01:04:48,933 --> 01:04:51,424
I should have known.
I should have seen the signs.

668
01:04:51,569 --> 01:04:53,434
- Dad?
- We had a deal!

669
01:04:53,571 --> 01:04:57,632
I know we did. That was before...
It's all so messed up.

670
01:04:57,775 --> 01:05:01,233
So everything in the ring,
a trick? A lie?

671
01:05:01,379 --> 01:05:05,509
I screwed up. I should have
told you before now. I just...

672
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:09,245
Take this out on me, be mad at me,
but please, just don't hurt Toothless.

673
01:05:09,387 --> 01:05:12,584
The dragon?
That's what you're worried about?

674
01:05:12,723 --> 01:05:14,452
Not the people you almost killed?

675
01:05:14,592 --> 01:05:17,026
He was protecting me!
He's not dangerous.

676
01:05:17,161 --> 01:05:19,186
They've killed hundreds of us!

677
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:21,059
And we've killed thousands of them!

678
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:26,501
They defend themselves, that's all!
They raid us because they have to.

679
01:05:26,637 --> 01:05:30,505
If they don't bring enough food back,
they'll be eaten themselves.

680
01:05:30,641 --> 01:05:34,975
There's something else
on their island. It's a dragon like...

681
01:05:35,112 --> 01:05:37,876
Their island?
So you've been to the nest?

682
01:05:38,015 --> 01:05:39,846
- Did I say nest?
- How did you find it?

683
01:05:39,984 --> 01:05:42,544
What? No, I didn't. Toothless did.

684
01:05:42,687 --> 01:05:45,383
Only a dragon can find the island.

685
01:05:46,724 --> 01:05:49,887
No, no, no. No, Dad.
No, please, it's not what you think.

686
01:05:50,027 --> 01:05:53,121
You don't know what you're up against.
It's like nothing you've ever seen.

687
01:05:53,264 --> 01:05:57,200
Dad, please. I promise you,
you can't win this one!

688
01:05:57,335 --> 01:05:59,394
No, Dad. No.

689
01:05:59,537 --> 01:06:02,506
For once in your life,
would you please just listen to me?!

690
01:06:06,277 --> 01:06:10,043
You've thrown your lot in with them.
You're not a Viking.

691
01:06:12,316 --> 01:06:14,181
You're not my son.

692
01:06:17,388 --> 01:06:18,650
Ready the ships!

693
01:06:30,668 --> 01:06:31,862
This way.

694
01:07:14,211 --> 01:07:15,735
Set sail!

695
01:07:16,113 --> 01:07:18,479
We head for Helheim's Gate.

696
01:07:27,024 --> 01:07:29,356
Lead us home, devil.

697
01:07:50,247 --> 01:07:51,737
It's a mess.

698
01:07:53,084 --> 01:07:56,349
You must feel horrible.
You've lost everything:

699
01:07:56,487 --> 01:07:59,388
Your father, your tribe,
your best friend.

700
01:07:59,523 --> 01:08:01,718
Thank you for summing that up.

701
01:08:03,561 --> 01:08:07,088
Why couldn't I have killed that dragon
when I found him in the woods?

702
01:08:07,231 --> 01:08:11,497
- Would have been better for everyone.
- Yep. The rest of us would've done it.

703
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:14,235
So why didn't you?

704
01:08:16,907 --> 01:08:19,671
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.

705
01:08:20,644 --> 01:08:22,578
- I couldn't.
- That's not an answer.

706
01:08:22,713 --> 01:08:25,045
Why is this so important
to you all of a sudden?

707
01:08:25,182 --> 01:08:28,379
Because I want to remember
what you say right now.

708
01:08:28,586 --> 01:08:33,649
For the love of... I was a coward.
I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.

709
01:08:33,791 --> 01:08:35,053
You said "wouldn't".

710
01:08:35,192 --> 01:08:37,387
Whatever! I wouldn't!

711
01:08:37,528 --> 01:08:41,430
Three hundred years and I'm the first
Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.

712
01:08:45,903 --> 01:08:47,837
First one to ride one, though.

713
01:08:50,307 --> 01:08:51,296
So?

714
01:08:54,278 --> 01:08:57,645
I wouldn't kill him because
he looked as frightened as I was.

715
01:08:58,716 --> 01:09:02,311
I looked at him and I saw myself.

716
01:09:04,155 --> 01:09:08,819
I bet he's really frightened now.
What are you going to do about it?

717
01:09:10,261 --> 01:09:14,789
- Probably something stupid.
- Good, but you've already done that.

718
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,391
Then something crazy.

719
01:09:19,303 --> 01:09:21,396
That's more like it.

720
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:33,145
Sound your positions.
Stay within earshot.

721
01:09:33,284 --> 01:09:35,809
- Here!
- One length to your stern.

722
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:41,214
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some
of the men and, well, some of them

723
01:09:41,358 --> 01:09:44,987
are wondering what it is
we're up to here. Not me, of course.

724
01:09:45,129 --> 01:09:47,689
I know you're always the man
with the plan. But some,

725
01:09:47,832 --> 01:09:51,359
not me, are wondering if there is
in fact a plan at all

726
01:09:51,502 --> 01:09:55,131
- and what it might be.
- Find the nest and take it.

727
01:09:55,272 --> 01:09:57,433
Of course. Send them running.

728
01:09:57,575 --> 01:10:00,339
The old Viking fallback.
Nice and simple.

729
01:10:09,253 --> 01:10:10,914
Step aside.

730
01:10:24,268 --> 01:10:25,394
Bear to port.

731
01:10:30,374 --> 01:10:34,674
If you're planning on getting eaten,
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.

732
01:10:35,813 --> 01:10:39,943
You were wise to seek help
from the world's most deadly weapon.

733
01:10:40,084 --> 01:10:41,073
It's me.

734
01:10:41,218 --> 01:10:43,618
- I love this plan.
- I didn't...

735
01:10:43,754 --> 01:10:46,621
You're crazy. I like that.

736
01:10:47,091 --> 01:10:49,457
So, what is the plan?

737
01:10:59,637 --> 01:11:01,400
That's not really encouraging.

738
01:11:03,774 --> 01:11:05,833
I was wondering where that went.

739
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:21,086
Stay low and ready your weapons.

740
01:11:36,774 --> 01:11:38,036
We're here.

741
01:12:11,008 --> 01:12:13,533
- Wait! What are you?
- Relax.

742
01:12:13,677 --> 01:12:15,872
It's OK. It's OK.

743
01:12:27,591 --> 01:12:28,580
Where are you going?

744
01:12:28,726 --> 01:12:31,354
You'll need something
to help you hold on.

745
01:12:40,437 --> 01:12:44,635
When we crack this mountain open,
all hell is going to break loose.

746
01:12:44,775 --> 01:12:47,767
In my undies.
Good thing I brought extras.

747
01:12:47,911 --> 01:12:51,176
No matter how this ends,
it ends today.

748
01:13:46,136 --> 01:13:47,865
Is that it?

749
01:13:52,543 --> 01:13:53,874
We've done it!

750
01:14:02,786 --> 01:14:06,950
This isn't over!
Form your ranks! Hold together!

751
01:14:20,104 --> 01:14:21,731
Get clear!

752
01:14:31,248 --> 01:14:33,808
Beard of Thor! What is that?!

753
01:14:38,021 --> 01:14:39,886
Odin help us.

754
01:14:44,695 --> 01:14:45,753
Catapults!

755
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:57,839
- Get to the ships!
- No! No!

756
01:15:10,721 --> 01:15:12,689
- Smart, that one.
- I was a fool.

757
01:15:12,823 --> 01:15:14,984
Lead the men
to the far side of the island!

758
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:16,319
Gobber, go with men!

759
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:19,452
I think I'll stay, in case your
thinking of doing something crazy.

760
01:15:19,596 --> 01:15:22,759
I can buy them a few minutes
if I give that thing someone to hunt!

761
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:24,424
Then I can double that time.

762
01:15:27,171 --> 01:15:30,470
- Here!
- Oh, no! Here!

763
01:15:40,617 --> 01:15:43,814
Come on! Fight me!

764
01:15:43,954 --> 01:15:45,819
No, me!

765
01:15:52,429 --> 01:15:54,693
Ruff, Tuff! Watch your backs!

766
01:15:54,832 --> 01:15:57,027
Move, Fishlegs!

767
01:15:57,167 --> 01:16:01,035
Look at us! We're on a dragon.
We're on dragons! All of us!

768
01:16:02,706 --> 01:16:04,970
Up! Let's move it!

769
01:16:05,476 --> 01:16:09,913
Every bit the boar-headed
stubborn Viking you ever were!

770
01:16:11,682 --> 01:16:13,343
- Fishlegs, break it down!
- OK.

771
01:16:13,484 --> 01:16:16,317
Heavily armored skull and tail
made for bashing and crushing!

772
01:16:16,453 --> 01:16:20,480
Steer clear of both. Small eyes, large
nostrils! Relies on hearing and smell!

773
01:16:20,624 --> 01:16:24,025
OK, Lout, legs! Hang in its blind spot,
make noise, keep it confused!

774
01:16:24,161 --> 01:16:27,927
Ruff, Tuff, find out
if it has a shot limit! Make it mad!

775
01:16:28,065 --> 01:16:29,464
That's my specialty!

776
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,933
Since when?! Everyone knows
I'm more irritating! See.

777
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:36,301
Just do what I told you!
I'll be back as soon as I can!

778
01:16:36,707 --> 01:16:39,232
- Don't worry! We got it covered!
- Yeah!

779
01:16:48,218 --> 01:16:49,310
- Troll!
- Butt elf!

780
01:16:49,453 --> 01:16:50,977
Bride of Grendel!

781
01:16:56,793 --> 01:16:59,261
This thing doesn't have a blind spot!

782
01:17:02,032 --> 01:17:03,021
There!

783
01:17:11,508 --> 01:17:12,668
Go help the others!

784
01:17:14,545 --> 01:17:15,910
OK, hold on. Hold on.

785
01:17:19,883 --> 01:17:22,351
- It's working!
- Yeah, it's working!

786
01:17:31,995 --> 01:17:35,362
I've lost power on the Gronckle!
Snotlout, do something!

787
01:17:38,802 --> 01:17:40,326
I'm OK!

788
01:17:40,804 --> 01:17:41,964
Less OK!

789
01:17:44,641 --> 01:17:48,338
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy?
Something in your eye?

790
01:17:52,382 --> 01:17:54,213
Yeah! You're the Viking!

791
01:18:31,955 --> 01:18:33,081
Dad?

792
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:53,274
You got it, bud.

793
01:18:56,113 --> 01:18:57,239
Hiccup!

794
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:02,947
I'm sorry... for everything.

795
01:19:03,353 --> 01:19:04,445
Yeah. Me, too.

796
01:19:04,888 --> 01:19:06,480
You don't have to go up there.

797
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:10,557
We're Vikings.
It's an occupational hazard.

798
01:19:11,928 --> 01:19:14,897
I'm proud to call you my son.

799
01:19:16,299 --> 01:19:17,288
Thanks, Dad.

800
01:19:23,407 --> 01:19:24,669
He's up!

801
01:19:27,577 --> 01:19:29,135
Get Snotlout out of there.

802
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,541
- I'm on it!
- I'm on it first!

803
01:19:30,681 --> 01:19:32,273
- Hey, let me drive!
- I'm ahead of you.

804
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:33,883
No, this way.

805
01:19:34,017 --> 01:19:36,212
- Don't push me!
- I'll take your teeth out!

806
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:42,019
I can't believe that worked!

807
01:19:49,266 --> 01:19:50,631
Night Fury!

808
01:19:50,767 --> 01:19:52,496
Get down!

809
01:20:02,379 --> 01:20:03,437
Did you get her?

810
01:20:13,924 --> 01:20:14,913
Go.

811
01:20:15,092 --> 01:20:19,495
That thing has wings.
OK, let's see if it can use them!

812
01:20:35,445 --> 01:20:37,436
You think that did it?

813
01:20:42,385 --> 01:20:44,148
Well, he can fly.

814
01:21:05,008 --> 01:21:07,738
OK, Toothless, time to disappear.

815
01:21:07,878 --> 01:21:09,106
Come on, bud!

816
01:21:15,185 --> 01:21:16,812
Here it comes!

817
01:22:09,172 --> 01:22:10,503
Watch out!

818
01:22:12,676 --> 01:22:15,008
OK, time's up! Let's see if this works.

819
01:22:17,814 --> 01:22:19,805
Come on! Is that the best you can do?!

820
01:22:37,701 --> 01:22:40,101
Stay with me, buddy.
Just a bit longer.

821
01:22:44,774 --> 01:22:46,366
Hold, Toothless.

822
01:22:47,177 --> 01:22:48,303
Now!

823
01:23:12,402 --> 01:23:13,391
No.

824
01:23:13,904 --> 01:23:15,269
No!

825
01:23:31,021 --> 01:23:32,352
Hiccup!

826
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:35,151
Hiccup!

827
01:23:36,426 --> 01:23:37,688
Son!

828
01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:41,788
Hiccup.

829
01:24:03,586 --> 01:24:05,247
Oh, son.

830
01:24:06,823 --> 01:24:08,290
I did this.

831
01:24:38,088 --> 01:24:41,353
Oh, son, I'm so sorry.

832
01:24:48,064 --> 01:24:49,053
Hiccup!

833
01:24:55,839 --> 01:24:58,831
He's alive.
You brought him back alive.

834
01:25:15,859 --> 01:25:18,794
Thank you for saving my son.

835
01:25:19,596 --> 01:25:22,588
Well, you know... most of him.

836
01:25:40,884 --> 01:25:42,476
Hey, Toothless.

837
01:25:43,353 --> 01:25:45,617
I'm happy to see you, too.

838
01:25:48,792 --> 01:25:51,352
I'm in my house.

839
01:25:52,495 --> 01:25:54,360
You're in my house.

840
01:25:54,631 --> 01:25:56,326
Does my dad know you're here?

841
01:25:56,466 --> 01:25:58,627
What? OK, OK.

842
01:25:59,135 --> 01:26:01,228
Toothless, no. No, Toothless.

843
01:26:01,371 --> 01:26:03,498
Toothless! Oh, come on.

844
01:26:42,245 --> 01:26:44,736
OK. Thanks, bud.

845
01:26:55,425 --> 01:26:58,986
- Toothless, stay here.
- Come on, guys. Get ready!

846
01:26:59,129 --> 01:27:00,391
Hold on tight! Here we go!

847
01:27:03,633 --> 01:27:04,759
What?

848
01:27:13,009 --> 01:27:15,239
I knew it. I'm dead.

849
01:27:16,379 --> 01:27:20,372
No, but you gave it your best shot.
So, what do you think?

850
01:27:20,517 --> 01:27:22,178
Hey, look, it's Hiccup!

851
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:24,882
It's Hiccup!

852
01:27:26,723 --> 01:27:30,591
Turns out all we needed
was a little more of this.

853
01:27:30,727 --> 01:27:32,786
You just gestured to all of me.

854
01:27:33,863 --> 01:27:36,991
Well, most of you.
That bit's my handiwork.

855
01:27:37,467 --> 01:27:40,664
With a little Hiccup flair thrown in.
You think it'll do?

856
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:43,129
I might make a few tweaks.

857
01:27:45,008 --> 01:27:46,873
That's for scaring me.

858
01:27:47,010 --> 01:27:49,570
What is it always going
to be this way? 'Cause...

859
01:27:52,148 --> 01:27:53,672
...I could get used to it.

860
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:58,785
Welcome home.

861
01:27:58,922 --> 01:28:01,186
- Night Fury!
- Get down!

862
01:28:12,335 --> 01:28:13,324
You ready?

863
01:28:15,471 --> 01:28:17,962
This is Berk.

864
01:28:18,441 --> 01:28:22,207
It snows nine months of the year
and hails the other three.

865
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:27,514
Any food that grows here
is tough and tasteless.

866
01:28:29,052 --> 01:28:32,180
The people that grow here
are even more so.

867
01:28:36,059 --> 01:28:38,186
The only upsides are the pets.

868
01:28:41,130 --> 01:28:44,861
While other places
have ponies or parrots...

869
01:28:46,202 --> 01:28:47,726
...we have...

870
01:28:48,805 --> 01:28:50,204
...dragons.
