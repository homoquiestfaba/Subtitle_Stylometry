1
00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:02,528
9-1-1 where is your emergency?

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,230
There is blood everywhere.

3
00:00:04,232 --> 00:00:06,332
That sounds very grizzly, sir
I'm just going to ask you a

4
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:08,334
couple questions. Have you had
any trouble urinating?

5
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:09,535
No.

6
00:00:09,537 --> 00:00:11,170
Do you have any new
sexual partners?

7
00:00:11,172 --> 00:00:12,672
No.

8
00:00:12,674 --> 00:00:14,674
I need to know what you had
for dinner this evening?

9
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:16,375
A salad.

10
00:00:16,377 --> 00:00:19,211
Could there have been
beets in the salad sir?

11
00:00:19,213 --> 00:00:20,613
There is spinach...

12
00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:22,148
Was there goat cheese?

13
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:23,950
Oh yeah, actually there
were beets in there.

14
00:00:23,952 --> 00:00:28,487
Yes beets often change the consistency
and the color of your stool.

15
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,056
- Really?
- You are going to be fine.

16
00:00:30,058 --> 00:00:31,490
I promise it's not
blood, it's beets.

17
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:33,492
Oh damn ok, thank you.

18
00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:35,227
You are very welcome.

19
00:00:35,229 --> 00:00:38,331
9-1-1 what's your emergency?

20
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:39,699
Please stop crying.

21
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:42,501
Don't roll your eyes.

22
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:44,103
They can't see me rolling my
eyes, she doesn't know I'm

23
00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:45,271
rolling my eyes.

24
00:00:45,273 --> 00:00:46,439
What?

25
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:48,040
What have you eaten today?

26
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:49,608
I had a bowl of soup.

27
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,010
At any point do you think you
had any beets?

28
00:00:51,012 --> 00:00:52,178
- No.
- Ok,

29
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,346
what kind of soup was it?

30
00:00:53,348 --> 00:00:54,513
Borscht.

31
00:00:54,515 --> 00:00:56,282
Borscht is actually
made from beets.

32
00:00:56,284 --> 00:00:57,450
So you did have beets.

33
00:00:57,452 --> 00:00:58,985
What should I do?

34
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:00,386
Just flush a couple
times, it will be fine.

35
00:01:02,623 --> 00:01:05,391
9-1-1 where is your emergency?
Are you able to breathe?

36
00:01:05,393 --> 00:01:06,559
<i>Yeah.</i>

37
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:07,994
- Is it beets?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

38
00:01:07,996 --> 00:01:09,161
Great.

39
00:01:09,163 --> 00:01:10,329
- Hi was it beets?
- Yup.

40
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:11,697
Thought so.

41
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:13,065
9-1-1 how are those
beets you ate tonight?

42
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:14,400
Hi I assume it's beets?

43
00:01:14,402 --> 00:01:15,568
Beets butt what's your problem?

44
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,370
Do you have a red toilet?

45
00:01:17,372 --> 00:01:19,071
All that is ma'am is just
beets discoloring your stool.

46
00:01:19,073 --> 00:01:20,373
You can call it a stool stain.

47
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,540
You don't have rectum cancer.

48
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:23,042
It's beets.

49
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:24,210
You didn't notice
I had a hair cut.

50
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:25,344
Where did you get a hair cut?

51
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:30,282
Right here.
This is shorter.

52
00:01:30,284 --> 00:01:32,218
9-1-1 what is your emergency?

53
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,587
<i>I've had a car accident.</i>

54
00:01:34,589 --> 00:01:35,755
Can you tell me your exact
location?

55
00:01:35,757 --> 00:01:37,356
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

56
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:40,026
Did you have a beets in a
salad, or beet chips or...

57
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:42,028
<i>Beets am I understanding</i>
<i>you correctly?</i>

58
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,796
Beets the vegetable.

59
00:01:43,798 --> 00:01:45,297
<i>I was in a car accident,</i>
<i>there's a...</i>

60
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,801
<i>I'm covered in red,</i>
<i>wait a minute.</i>

61
00:01:48,803 --> 00:01:52,271
You know what, you're
right it is beets.

62
00:01:52,273 --> 00:01:55,574
I crashed into a beet truck. How
the heck did you know that?

63
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:57,243
Sir, it's always beets.

64
00:01:57,245 --> 00:01:59,145
I think I'm covered
in beet juice.

65
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:00,780
Of course it's beets sir, thanks
for calling.

66
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:05,251
Hello, 9-1-1.

67
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:30,889
Sync and corrections by n17t01

68
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:34,313
Settle down everyone.

69
00:02:34,315 --> 00:02:35,848
It's been a good year.

70
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,651
Heirloom tomatoes didn't even
exist five years ago.

71
00:02:38,653 --> 00:02:41,353
Now eaten like steak,
kale consumption is at

72
00:02:41,355 --> 00:02:43,756
an all time high.

73
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:46,559
Excellent work Larry.
Hahaha,

74
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:49,662
and brussels sprouts are back.

75
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:51,330
Don't know how you did it Bill.

76
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:52,565
Ah, they sell themselves.

77
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:54,867
Which brings us to celery.

78
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:58,337
Yes, Marty I'm
talking about you.

79
00:02:58,339 --> 00:02:59,505
Yeah, doing
the best I can here.

80
00:02:59,507 --> 00:03:00,673
Your numbers are down.

81
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:01,840
- Yeah.
- Look at this graph.

82
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:03,209
Oh because my graph...

83
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:04,376
That's you down here.

84
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:05,544
I don't have that same graph.

85
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:07,213
Oh.

86
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:09,215
Did you ever here of a
thing called Bloody Marys?

87
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:10,883
I need new ideas Marty.

88
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:14,353
What I'm trying to get back to
you is just food, just a basic

89
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:16,956
stick of celery is
good in and of itself.

90
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,892
Really Marty? Because I
feel like celery is limp.

91
00:03:19,894 --> 00:03:23,229
Ah, old celery is,
I'm talking about

92
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:28,701
the new and improved celery. I'm
gonna do a whole, a whole viral

93
00:03:28,703 --> 00:03:32,538
celery phenomenon that is just
going to knock your socks off.

94
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,541
My socks are already off, Marty.

95
00:03:35,543 --> 00:03:41,280
Popeye, I'm gonna talk with uh,
who does Popeye? It's not

96
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:43,849
Hannah-Barbera, no I'll find
out. I'll get on it.

97
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:47,553
And I think we should have the
New Adventures of Popeye.

98
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:51,924
- Instead of eating spinach. He eats celery.
- Bill?

99
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:54,960
I've got an idea of
where to put the celery.

100
00:03:54,962 --> 00:03:57,630
How about the, what is it
called, the dumpster?

101
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:07,539
I just wanted to announce that
we just got an account with

102
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,609
Virgin Airlines. For brussels
sprouts to be featured on the

103
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:14,880
menu. With flights as a dessert.

104
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:19,551
Oh. Bravo.

105
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:23,022
- Honey and maple syrup.
- Real results Marty.

106
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:25,557
- That's what I'm looking for.
- I'm old school.

107
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:28,560
And I think most people when you
talk to them they would agree.

108
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:31,363
Marty you know who else
was old school?

109
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:35,334
Dick with alfalfa sprouts and
now Dick is gone.

110
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:36,969
We need new ideas.

111
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:39,872
I'm out of ideas! I don't know
what to do anymore.

112
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:43,676
Well, what about ants on a log?
You know, you put the two little

113
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:46,845
raisins and a smiley face.
That's how we met.

114
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:49,348
- That's how you wooed me.
- They laughed at me when I did the

115
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,885
peanut butter and the raisins.
They were pointing at me going

116
00:04:52,887 --> 00:04:54,920
- that's your idea?
- I don't know why they'd laugh.

117
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:57,690
Because you're a good guy and
that's a good snack.

118
00:04:57,692 --> 00:04:59,591
They're going to fire me. You
understand? They're going to

119
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:02,895
- fire me. Oh, I'm sorry.
- Have some dinner.

120
00:05:07,668 --> 00:05:09,902
- Beet salad?
- They were on sale at the market.

121
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:15,341
Yeah. Would it kill you to put a
little celery in there?

122
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:18,777
- In a beet salad?
- It's good!

123
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:21,580
- It doesn't taste good honey.
- Why don't people like celery?

124
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:23,716
It's full of soluble and
insoluble fiber.

125
00:05:23,718 --> 00:05:26,552
You don't understand that's very
hard on the digestive system.

126
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:37,363
- Ahhh.
- My life is falling apart.

127
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:48,507
Seventeen has just come in.
Number fifteen is paid.

128
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:50,609
Number twelve is ready.

129
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,518
- Hi, welcome to Order Grill.
- Hi.

130
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,387
- One?
- Yeah.

131
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:04,490
Welcome to the Order Grill.
Where the ordering experience

132
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:07,693
is tailored to your needs. First
of all, how was your day today?

133
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:10,396
- It was fine, thank you.
- Fine, ok. That's great.

134
00:06:10,398 --> 00:06:12,631
So you gotta fill this out.
There's a new email that you

135
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:15,634
make up for here. And then you
do your protein preference.

136
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:17,770
Then it's your veggies. There's
tomatoes, fried green tomatoes,

137
00:06:17,772 --> 00:06:20,005
sun dried tomatoes, cherry
tomatoes, red bell peppers and

138
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:22,775
then beverage bonanza. Ok,
that's just for...

139
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:25,177
- I know it seems like a lot.
- It does seem like a lot.

140
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:28,781
But it's not. And you would be
number eighteen. Guys number

141
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:32,100
- eighteen is putting in their order.
- It's a pastrami sandwich.

142
00:06:32,135 --> 00:06:33,585
Don't tell me your
order. That's not me.

143
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:35,187
Come on, come on. Let's go to
the first station.

144
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:38,624
- It seems complicated.
- Complicated!

145
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:41,827
- What are you talking about?
- I'll let you go.

146
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:44,563
- Hi, I'm Lillian and
I designed this restaurant. - Hi.

147
00:06:44,565 --> 00:06:48,167
What I've done is I've changed
the form and therefore the

148
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:52,104
entire essence of ordering.
You're going to order whatever

149
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:54,807
- you want. Can I give you a map?
- Pastrami sandwich.

150
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,588
So drink station is right over
there. To the right and then

151
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,191
back to the left. And the ice
station is right back over there.

152
00:07:12,193 --> 00:07:14,726
So you have the ice and
the soda at opposite ends.

153
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:18,730
I know, haha. Um, ok, fourteen
twenty-eight.

154
00:07:18,732 --> 00:07:21,033
And when do I get my food?

155
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:29,675
- Pastrami sandwich.
- Is that me?

156
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:32,511
- Pastrami.
- I have a potato flag.

157
00:07:32,513 --> 00:07:33,745
- Is that helpful?
- Pastrami sandwich.

158
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:35,848
- Twelve?
- Is your name Pastrami?

159
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,584
- No.
- Pastrami?

160
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:42,221
- Does it have Sauerkraut on it?
- No, then it's not yours.

161
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:44,156
- It's probably mine.
- We'll start it from the

162
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:46,625
beginning.

163
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:50,358
- Hi, I'm Trish.
- I'm Jayme, welcome to Pet

164
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,193
- Haven.
- This is Jack White.

165
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:55,663
Jack White loves to run away.
Yeah, it's a really good dog for

166
00:07:55,665 --> 00:07:57,398
- running away.
- If you're someone that loves

167
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,333
- the chase.
- If you want to make fliers,

168
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:02,128
- if you want to be stressed out
all night. - That dog is for you.

169
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:15,987
Hey, can I get a Bloody Mary
please? Thanks pal.

170
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:17,756
What the hell is this?

171
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:21,292
Pickles? Pickles in a Bloody
Mary? Where's the celery?

172
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:25,130
This is not proper bartending.
This is bullshit.

173
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,905
Oh, hey Bill. Bill! Bill!
Hey, it's me Marty.

174
00:08:33,907 --> 00:08:37,042
- How are you doing Marty?
- Hey, can I buy you a drink and

175
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:40,045
maybe pick your brain a little
bit? Hey, can I get a Bloody

176
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:43,748
Mary for my friend here.
Congratulations on a great year.

177
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,316
- I mean, wow.
- Well,

178
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:47,452
- boy oh boy.
- We just got an account

179
00:08:47,454 --> 00:08:50,989
with the country of
Russia. Imagine that.

180
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:53,925
- How do you do it?
- In order to get up you've got

181
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:55,894
to use your brain. You've got to
use your, you know, your

182
00:08:55,896 --> 00:09:00,131
- intellect. How are you making
people re-think celery? - Soup.

183
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,734
Does that seem exciting to you?
Soup? You're going to walk into

184
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:06,171
a five star restaurant and say,
"Hey you guys need to start

185
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:09,207
selling celery soup." You want
people to get something in a

186
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:15,480
plate and go, "Try this, try
this." You think they're going

187
00:09:15,482 --> 00:09:18,283
to do that about soup? Who are
you partnering with?

188
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:22,921
- For a while raisins. But...
- What is it 1955?

189
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:25,023
I need help.

190
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:28,359
Look, I'm gonna... I'm going to
give you a phone number.

191
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:32,263
You've got to reach out to some
other foods. You did not get

192
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:34,232
this from me.

193
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:39,838
Bacon? You son of a gun.
This guy is a genius.

194
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,907
Don't be desperate. Stop being
sweaty about everything.

195
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:46,411
Make a new business partner, but
don't get too friendly.

196
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:50,148
You understand what I'm saying?
The stove is hot don't burn your fingers.

197
00:09:54,154 --> 00:09:56,888
- Hello?
- Hi honey, it's me.

198
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,959
I got a lead on something and
I'm pretty excited about it.

199
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:02,894
I'm going to have to go away for
a little while.

200
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:05,096
I don't like how you're sounding
Marty, please come home.

201
00:10:05,098 --> 00:10:07,031
- Do you trust me?
- Yeah, I trust you.

202
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:09,367
- Just be careful, ok?
- Of course I'm going to be

203
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:13,972
careful. And I'm going to get us
both those cell phones we want.

204
00:10:13,974 --> 00:10:15,940
- I love you.
- I love you too.

205
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:46,404
Like, like. Happy B-day.

206
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:56,815
Ok, Ms. Brownstein you are here
to declare social bankruptcy.

207
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:59,984
I want you to be clear on what
this means. You will be absolved

208
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:03,121
of all debt. All your Facebook
friends will be gone, all your

209
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:06,057
emails and voicemails will be
deleted. All your Twitter

210
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:08,359
followers will be gone. You'll
be able to start with a clean

211
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:10,895
slate. But this is kind of the
nuclear option.

212
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:13,832
Do you want to get that?

213
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,900
It's like it physically hurts
when it goes off.

214
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:18,570
- I just want you to know.
- I'm sorry hold on, hold on.

215
00:11:18,572 --> 00:11:21,406
If you need to, you know, like a
couple of friends. Instagram or

216
00:11:21,408 --> 00:11:23,107
- something.
- I don't, I don't want to do

217
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:24,943
- any of that anymore.
- We do offer counseling to help

218
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:27,445
- you sort of get out of debt.
- I tried that, I feel like my

219
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:30,582
- bandwidth is just full.
- I have some template responses

220
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:35,920
I use... um, pet pictures. I'll
just write, "Cuuuuuute."

221
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:39,190
- Just with like a bunch of Os.
- Cute is with a U.

222
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:43,561
- No, C-Y-O-O-O-O-T.
- I appreciate that you've come

223
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:47,131
up with a method for dealing
with it. I don't want to live my

224
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:49,300
life like that.

225
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:56,007
You're just supposed to
put that in there?

226
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:03,348
I'm so jacked up right now. You
know, Pink re-tweeted me

227
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,183
- recently.
- Yeah, that must feel

228
00:12:05,185 --> 00:12:08,586
- fulfilling.
- Huge. One of my biggest ones.

229
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:12,123
A play on words, I said, "Abacus
is a machine you can really

230
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,592
- count on."
- I can't wait to miss out on

231
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:17,562
- jokes like that.
- Alright, Ms. Brownstein.

232
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:20,231
- You can sign right there.
- I'll go to the library and

233
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:22,901
- find something in a book. And...
- What's a library?

234
00:12:22,903 --> 00:12:24,235
Is that like a big Kindle?

235
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:28,973
Oh my God, Fred, I just got back
from Powell's. I got so many

236
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:31,676
books. I got that one Lorrie
Moore book that I have not read

237
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:34,545
yet. I went to acupuncture then
I got a massage. I just have so

238
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:36,581
much time I feel like I'm just
soaking it all in.

239
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,384
- I feel so alive.
- I'm sorry, do I know you from

240
00:12:39,386 --> 00:12:41,185
- some place?
- Seriously?

241
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:45,356
Yeah, you seem very cute and I
hope that we met somewhere

242
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:47,458
great. Are you
visiting Portland?

243
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,095
- Fred, it's Carrie.
- Carrie? Carrie what?

244
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:55,133
Brownstein, B-R-O-W-N-S-T-E-I-N.

245
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:57,101
- Listen.
- Ok, are you on Facebook?

246
00:12:57,103 --> 00:12:58,436
No, I'm not on Facebook anymore.

247
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:01,139
So you are not on there.
Are we friends?

248
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:02,307
- Yes we're best friends.
- We're best friends?

249
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:04,242
We're best friends.

250
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:07,612
Let me just Google you, wow I've
never seen a blank Google page.

251
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:09,547
It's almost like you
don't exist, you're not

252
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:12,150
on Google at all
Carrie Brownstine.

253
00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:13,685
- Stein.
- I don't no anything

254
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:16,120
about you if you're
not on here or on Instagram.

255
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:18,489
- Are you on Instagram?
- No.

256
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:20,591
I want to go back,
I changed my mind.

257
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:28,066
Just give me a second, meowbama,
for pawsident, let's go.

258
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:34,272
Ok, so here are other people who
aren't online, your new group

259
00:13:34,274 --> 00:13:38,576
of friends, say hello to
Bronwin, your aunt Elizabeth

260
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:44,315
Dave, Coma Dave and a baby.

261
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:45,650
What about my other friends.

262
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:47,352
They're gone.

263
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:50,388
I'm making a scrap book for you,
about the spotted owls

264
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,091
that I told you about them in
the '70s and all the big ruckus

265
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:54,459
that they caused.

266
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:56,227
She is your Wikipedia now.

267
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:59,764
Now they were trying to get the
barred owls to be killed.

268
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:03,034
I have to go, I'm so sorry, I
miss the internet.

269
00:14:03,036 --> 00:14:05,269
- This is what you wanted.
- Fred, Fred!

270
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:06,604
But owls are very amazing.

271
00:14:06,606 --> 00:14:10,108
I'm still online, thanks.

272
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,642
Fred, Fred I'll get
back online, I'll leave a

273
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:12,128
giant digital footprint.

274
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:25,208
Hello?

275
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,709
Who is it?

276
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:31,447
Oh hi it's me Marty from celery,
are you the bacon guy?

277
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:35,284
You're a little bit early, I've
never really heard that word

278
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:38,187
before, "The bacon guy" if
that's what you'd like to

279
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:42,191
call me I don't really care.

280
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:45,561
I don't mean any disrespect, I
get called the celery guy.

281
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:50,199
Well you're a man who
celebrates, sells celery

282
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:54,237
so therefore you're a guy
and you're the celery guy.

283
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:58,107
I actually think that celery is
exciting in its own right.

284
00:14:58,109 --> 00:15:01,477
It's not that I need bacon.

285
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:04,280
But right now I could
really use some help.

286
00:15:04,282 --> 00:15:08,551
What do you have for me, that's
what I'd like to know.

287
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:10,319
Do you have a girlfriend?

288
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:11,521
I'm married.

289
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:13,623
Oh well.

290
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:17,727
But I'm willing to share the
profits, of course.

291
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:20,196
Once celery takes off.

292
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:22,298
You want to play games with me?

293
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,167
I do not want to play games with
you, I'm here to make a deal.

294
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:25,635
I'm here on business.

295
00:15:25,637 --> 00:15:28,337
Well this is what I'd like, I
know you have a wife and I

296
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:31,307
would like one night with your
wife and then we will be in

297
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:34,644
business together and
you'll be a huge success.

298
00:15:34,646 --> 00:15:36,446
You want to sleep with my wife?

299
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:39,715
I would, yeah, I'd like that.

300
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:42,652
No offense, I don't
think she'd like you.

301
00:15:42,654 --> 00:15:44,387
Nobody does.

302
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:48,825
I'll do it.

303
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:50,259
Do you want to see
a picture of him?

304
00:15:50,261 --> 00:15:51,828
I'm good.

305
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,199
Ok, I want you to understand I'm
not asking you to do this.

306
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:59,435
Listen I'm going to have sex
with the bacon guy, celery is

307
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:02,138
going to get back on top and we
are going to take that trip.

308
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,508
To Santa Barbara like we keep
saying we are going to do. Ok?

309
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,512
I'll talk to him, maybe he
would go for a hand job.

310
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:13,583
- Ok.
- Ok, this is just...

311
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:17,120
I give a great hand job by the
way that is not a downgrade.

312
00:16:17,122 --> 00:16:19,822
It's going to feel like
intercourse for him.

313
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:30,466
What's wrong with me, stupid
celery, what am I doing?

314
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:46,282
You don't look so good.

315
00:16:46,284 --> 00:16:49,685
My wife is going to
bang a guy from bacon.

316
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:54,457
Do you know what
F-B-I stands for?

317
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:56,459
- You're from the FBI?
- Don't look at me.

318
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:59,529
We've been investigating bacon
for years, if you were willing

319
00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:05,268
to wear a wire I think we could
bring bacon down, you in?

320
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,204
I'm in, I'll do
whatever it takes.

321
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:09,639
Popcorn?

322
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:15,711
- Thanks
- You're welcome.

323
00:17:15,713 --> 00:17:18,548
Are you going to
call me or anything?

324
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,053
Do you own any change?

325
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:26,522
Spare change do
you have a dollar?

326
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:27,990
Spare change?

327
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:29,625
Does anyone have a dollar?

328
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:31,994
- Help us out.
- Do you have a dollar?

329
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,097
Hi do you have a dollar?

330
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:40,002
This is going to sound kind of

job for years, 9-5 everyday

monotonous, you know like,

333
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:49,678

to me "Thank God it's Friday"

334
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,146

335
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:53,983

336
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:57,653

00:17:57,655 --> 00:18:00,122
- Sort of getting it.
- Yeah, but you want to do like...

338
00:18:00,124 --> 00:18:01,590
Do you have any change,
you got to do some volume.

339
00:18:01,592 --> 00:18:02,892
Do you have a dollar?

340
00:18:02,894 --> 00:18:05,628
- Dollar. - Dollar. - Dollar.

341
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,630

Yeah, give us a dollar.

343
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:12,134
So you are going to be one of us

344
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:14,136
Yeah, I mean these are the colors
I sort of live in sort of a cats

345
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:17,306
tongue this is like a lavender,
this is like a devotion blue.

346
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:19,675
Yeah, that's got to go.

347
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,581
Things have to hang,
you need a lot of this.

348
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,749
What are those for?

349
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:28,284
Just so you can hear it.

350
00:18:28,286 --> 00:18:31,820
I don't know it doesn't feel
like me, I feel a little exposed.

351
00:18:31,822 --> 00:18:32,988
It's because you don't
have your animal.

352
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,156
Yeah.

353
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:35,591
No.

354
00:18:35,593 --> 00:18:36,825
No.

355
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:37,993
No.

356
00:18:37,995 --> 00:18:39,194
Now what?

357
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:41,163
Now we walk around.

358
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:53,042
Hey guys, sorry I don't think
this is working for me.

359
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:56,211
My therapist said I needed to
get out, get more exercise.

360
00:18:56,213 --> 00:18:58,113
I think I'm just
going to go join a gym.

361
00:18:58,115 --> 00:18:59,949
That's going to take a lot of
pan handling to...

362
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:01,717
I'm actually rich, I
have a lot of dollars.

363
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:02,885
Wait, you're rich?

364
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:04,086
Yeah, I have a ton of money.

365
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:05,888
I mean I'm rich too.

366
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,256
Really?

367
00:19:07,258 --> 00:19:08,624
Yeah, I like grew up in
the South West Hills.

368
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:10,159
What school did you guys go to?

369
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:12,828
- Caitlin Gabel, where did you?
- No way! Central Catholic!

370
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,129
What sports did you
play in high school?

371
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:15,998
I was pretty good at tennis.

372
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,833
I was ranked eighth in state.

373
00:19:17,835 --> 00:19:19,001
- Oh my God.
- Steffi Graf she was like

374
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:20,169
my hero.

375
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:21,870
Steffi Graf.

376
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:23,072
- Weddle fan? Boris Becker fan?
- I was a Beck head.

377
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:24,673
I knew it.

378
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:26,842
Do you know Denis McDonald?

379
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:31,847
Oh he's real famous.

380
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:33,782
Well it was cool hanging out
with you guys I think I'm going

381
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:35,217
to go back to work tomorrow.

382
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:37,620
Oh I don't think you
have to work tomorrow.

383
00:19:37,622 --> 00:19:38,821
Oh yeah, it's Friday.

384
00:19:38,823 --> 00:19:40,155
Huh, T-G-I-F.

385
00:19:40,157 --> 00:19:41,690
Ahh haha.

386
00:19:58,751 --> 00:20:00,484
Come in.

387
00:20:00,486 --> 00:20:04,087
- Hey.
- Why, hello Martin.

388
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:05,956
This is my wife Loraine.

389
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,258
Have you ever seen
a Venus fly trap?

390
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,293
Not in real life.

391
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:15,065
It's kind of an animal and it's
kind of a plant at the same time.

392
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:20,137
So she's ready to have a go
with you in exchange for

393
00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:23,240
your help with the
celery deal that we made.

394
00:20:23,242 --> 00:20:26,810
You look like you're
wearing a wire.

395
00:20:26,812 --> 00:20:31,214
Haha. A wire? Why would I--

396
00:20:31,216 --> 00:20:32,983
Run!

397
00:20:32,985 --> 00:20:37,354
Stop running,
somebody catch them.

398
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:49,966
Hey, where were you, we almost
got, what's happening.

399
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:52,169
We have everything we need,
thanks for your help.

400
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:55,438
Who are you anyway?

401
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,475
- What kind of rows are those?
- Why is there corn everywhere?

402
00:20:58,477 --> 00:21:01,178
Corn used to be America's
vegetable and then along comes

403
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:06,082
bacon and makes every vegetable
from zucchini to celery sexier

404
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:09,419
than corn. I'm sorry you got
caught in the cross fire but

405
00:21:09,421 --> 00:21:11,855
our work here is done.

406
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:15,992
I was going to whore myself out,
is that still on the table?

407
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:17,928
Why would that still
be on the table?

408
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,496
For fun.

409
00:21:19,498 --> 00:21:22,999
<i>There was no FBI.</i>
<i>It was all a ruse</i>

410
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:26,403
big corn had been pulling the
strings all along and celery

411
00:21:26,405 --> 00:21:29,372
was caught in the cross fire,
thank you.

412
00:21:29,374 --> 00:21:31,875
If you want to find out what
happens next, you'll have to

413
00:21:31,877 --> 00:21:34,110
buy my book.

414
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,284
It's done.

415
