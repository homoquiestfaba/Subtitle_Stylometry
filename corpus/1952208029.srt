1
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,095
- Miss Deaver?

2
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,504
It's Deputy Lura, Ma'am.

3
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,203
Got a phone call from this house.

4
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,733
Somebody hung up.

5
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,806
Everything all right?

6
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,576
Miss Deaver?

7
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,566
Somebody in there?

8
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,600
I can hear you, you know.

9
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:40,075
Miss Deaver, is that you?

10
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,191
Jesus!

11
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:08,780
- Mm-hmm.

12
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,477
Okay.

13
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,111
My aunt died.

14
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,142
- Did she?

15
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,212
- Yeah, they just found her.

16
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
Looks like her heart.

17
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,417
- Oh, God, that's awful.

18
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,018
- Look at the bright side.

19
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,756
We got the house.

20
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,354
- What is the matter with you?

21
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,524
- Oome on, Robin.

22
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,864
Don't suddenly act like we were all close.

23
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,459
That woman was cold as hell to us.

24
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,492
- That's not the point.

25
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,526
- What is the point, Robin?

26
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,063
The point is, when someone just dies,
it's not a time to bad-mouth them.

27
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,269
It's a time to say a prayer
and count your own blessings.

28
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,511
- I am countin' my blessings.

29
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,175
I get the house.

30
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:47,914
- Marlene Deaver was not a great Oatholic.

31
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,320
But she was a great bingo player.

32
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,393
But I'm guessing God will take her,
because where it counted,

33
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,726
she loved her neighbor
with the best of them.

34
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,026
- You've got to be kiddin' me.

35
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,225
He doesn't show up
for his own aunt's funeral?

36
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,734
- He's in mourning.
He's just probably runnin' a little late.

37
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,937
- He looks in a good mood.

38
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,375
Someone should make sure he knows
that she didn't pull through.

39
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:15,108
- He's very strong, Oarl.

40
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,206
- Hello, Oarl.

41
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,739
- Sorry for your loss, Bryan.

42
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,808
- What?

43
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,819
Oh.
Oh, yeah.

44
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:21,911
It's a sad day.

45
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:25,683
So what'd I miss?

46
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,091
- Her eternal soul
being lifted up into heaven.

47
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,355
- Oh, shit.

48
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,192
I really wanted to catch that.

49
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,857
Hey, do you want to take a ride
with me later?

50
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:33,923
I'll drop you back.
- Where?

51
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:34,955
- My aunt's house.

52
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,332
I just got the key
from the sheriff.

53
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,358
- Thank you.

54
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,631
I may stop by.

55
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:42,563
Bryan Becket.

56
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,337
- Thank you for doing this, Father.

57
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,537
She would've appreciated it.

58
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,206
- Well, at least she came on time.

59
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,374
You don't take any of this seriously,
do you?

60
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,405
- What?

61
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,282
- Religious ritual, the church.

62
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,616
- Hey.

63
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,178
I'd love to take the church seriously,

64
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,383
but it's kind of hard
with the Pope runnin' around

65
00:05:58,424 --> 00:05:59,413
wearin' those hats.

66
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,922
- You want to know what I think
your problem with death is?

67
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:04,952
- Not really.

68
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,726
- You don't believe in anything, you know?

69
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,824
You don't believe in a higher power.

70
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,061
You don't believe
in the afterlife, nothin'.

71
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,126
- You're right.

72
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,228
Life would be easier if I were gullible.

73
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,533
- You think I'm gullible, Becket?

74
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,200
- Sully, you believe in everything.

75
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,230
- I don't believe in everything.

76
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,264
- Yes, you do.
- No.

77
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,006
- Okay, didn't you once tell me
you believed in the Loch Ness monster?

78
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,446
- They're gonna catch that sucker.

79
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,540
You'll see.

80
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,610
Scottish scientists went down
in that lake using sonar, Beck.

81
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,245
- And their results were inconclusive.

82
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,277
- Wrong!

83
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:34,419
They picked up a large moving mass
changing directions in organic patterns.

84
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,927
So what else could it be?

85
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:36,951
- I don't know.

86
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,157
I don't know what the military
was covering up at Roswell.

87
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,460
Does that make it aliens?

88
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,627
- No, but alien bodies
on the ground made it aliens.

89
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,101
- You know what your problem is, Sully?

90
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,502
- What?
- You were raised Oatholic.

91
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,527
- Oh, here we go.

92
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,561
- Really, I mean it.

93
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,768
How big a stretch can it be
believing in the Loch Ness monster

94
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,208
once you bought the Holy Trinity?

95
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,977
There it is.
- Oh, my God.

96
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,710
It's a monster.

97
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,774
She lived there alone?

98
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,080
I wouldn't be caught dead
alone in there.

99
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,108
Oreep me out.

100
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,054
- I can't wait to get in there.

101
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,216
Hear there's all kinds of antiques,
even a wine cellar.

102
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,384
- You hear?
Oh, that's right.

103
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,860
This is the aunt that didn't like you,
so she never invited you over.

104
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:09,884
- I don't care if she didn't like me.

105
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,918
She's dead now.

106
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,692
I'm invitin' myself over.

107
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,132
- Yeah, but why didn't she like you?

108
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,396
- Don't know.

109
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,564
- You know, I got to admit,
I find this all very, very intriguing.

110
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,041
- Yeah, well you also find
astrology intriguing, and it's not.

111
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,648
Wow.

112
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,014
How rich was she?

113
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,348
- She wasn't rich.

114
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,150
This house is the last
of the old family money.

115
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,054
- Yeah, but it's yours to sell, right?

116
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,079
- Yep.

117
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,753
- You know, I heard about all
the great parties she used to have up here.

118
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,318
You were never invited,
not even once?

119
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,351
- Look at this.

120
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,922
This is a genuine Iroquois vase
just sitting here.

121
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,524
- Did you offend her in some way

122
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,332
to insult her religious beliefs
or somethin'?

123
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,634
'Oause, you know,
you're known for that.

124
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,072
- The woman wasn't religious, Sully.

125
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,768
- She went to church every Sunday, Bryan.

126
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,505
- Yeah, so did all those people in Salem
who burned the witches.

127
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,910
- Yeah, right there, that comment?

128
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:04,348
That's the kind of thing that might
offend someone that was human.

129
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,645
- I wasn't offensive, Sully.

130
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,743
I was sweet and thoughtful,

131
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,845
and I was the lawyer in the family.

132
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:12,289
Get you out of a parking ticket,
manslaughter, whatever you need.

133
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,417
Solid mahogany.

134
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,155
- Yeah, but, you know,
something still doesn't add up, you know?

135
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,426
You got your classic mystery here.

136
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:20,454
Don't you see that?

137
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,434
- Yeah, it's right up there
with crop circles.

138
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,436
- Okay.
You know what?

139
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,495
I don't care how high
your IQ test scores were.

140
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,905
You lack common curiosity,
and that's a flaw.

141
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:29,930
It is.

142
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,102
And I've got it.

143
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,474
You know,
I'm curious all day long.

144
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,501
I'm like a two-year-old.

145
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,070
- You want to hear my theory
on my aunt?

146
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,548
- You have a theory?

147
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:42,384
- I don't think she was the saint
that everybody thought she was.

148
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:49,088
I think she was hiding something
about herself or about her past.

149
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,028
And she feared being around
someone like me,

150
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,089
someone who was smart
and shared her blood.

151
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:58,035
I just might figure it out.

152
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,765
That's a pretty juicy theory.

153
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,966
It's right up your alley.

154
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,066
What do you think, Sul?

155
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,738
- Sully!
Sully!

156
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,072
Hey!

157
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,104
Sully?

158
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,707
Sully.

159
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:12,740
Where's your juice?

160
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,185
Where's your juice?

161
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,813
Where's your ju... okay.

162
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,084
I got it.

163
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,182
All right, just hang on, pal.

164
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,214
You're gonna be fine.

165
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,590
Let's just get some juice in you.

166
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:25,188
- There's something upstairs
in the closet

167
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,426
behind the crucifix.

168
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,434
- What?

169
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,457
Oome on.

170
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,300
Sip this.

171
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,464
Sip it.

172
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,303
Good, good.

173
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,330
That better?

174
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,275
- Yeah.
- Feelin' better?

175
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,300
Is it working?
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,334
- Good.

177
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,471
You didn't eat today, did you?

178
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,503
- No.

179
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,537
- Well, God damn it, Sully.

180
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,073
You can't take those pills
and not eat.

181
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,677
How long's it gonna take you
to learn that?

182
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,153
- Apparently a little while longer.

183
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,622
- Yeah, have a little more.

184
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,648
- Okay.
Yeah.

185
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,820
Oh.

186
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,795
- What was that you were
blabbing about?

187
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,821
A closet upstairs with a crucifix?

188
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,355
- Did I say something?

189
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,799
Did I say something weird?

190
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,803
- What's this?

191
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,168
- I think it was on the desk.

192
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,194
- All right, come on.

193
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,400
You need food.

194
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:11,969
Hey.

195
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,535
You and I need to have a little talk.

196
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,046
- Man to man?

197
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,639
- Man to man.

198
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:23,579
Now, your mom and I told you
that my Aunt Marlene died, right?

199
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,612
- Her heart got old.

200
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,646
- Yeah.

201
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,125
And I'm in charge
of selling her house.

202
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,128
She's got a lot of expensive
stuff over there,

203
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:34,826
so I'm gonna have to go
and live there for a while,

204
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,801
make sure nobody takes anything.

205
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,599
- Okay.

206
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,935
Oan I visit?

207
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,031
- Of course you can.

208
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,063
Whenever you want.

209
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,441
And you can call me too, okay?

210
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,343
- Okay.

211
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,144
- I got to go tell Mom.

212
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,206
- Be careful.

213
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,774
She's still mad from breakfast.

214
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:03,953
- Hey.

215
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,487
Look, my aunt's house is just
gonna sit there until we sell it.

216
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,159
So I was thinking maybe I'd use it.

217
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,071
You know, just for a few weeks
or so like we talked about.

218
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:15,539
- Like we talked about?

219
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:16,700
- Yes.

220
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:17,902
Didn't we talk about this?

221
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,070
Didn't we talk about how
some time apart

222
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,602
might be exactly what we need
right now?

223
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,047
Didn't we say that was something
we should seriously consider?

224
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,243
- Yes, we said that.

225
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,582
But one of us was bluffing.

226
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,588
I guess we know now it wasn't you.

227
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:33,854
- No.

228
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,453
It wasn't me.

229
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,684
- Hi, this is Marlene Deaver.

230
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,812
Please leave a message.

231
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:39,484
Thank you.

232
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,514
- It's Bryan Becket.

233
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,151
Please leave a message.

234
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,354
Mornin', Oarol.

235
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,126
Hey, it's no rush,

236
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,259
but I still need
the Benes motion to compel.

237
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,394
Are you okay?

238
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,600
- I'm fine.

239
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,171
- Morning, Riley, Sarah.

240
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,146
What is wrong with everyone today?

241
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,705
Hey, could I talk to you
for a second?

242
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:44,807
- Mm-hmm.

243
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,909
- Please be seated.

244
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,251
Are you and Robin separated?

245
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,224
Now, I only know this because
Robin called Oeleste

246
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,159
who called Karen,

247
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,389
so it's gonna be on O-SPAN
in, like, five minutes.

248
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,260
- That's between Robin and me.

249
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,993
- And Oeleste and Karen.
- All right.

250
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:11,800
Robin thinks that I'm too unemotional.

251
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,369
- Unemotional?

252
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,348
She knew that goin' in.

253
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:19,749
- Thank you.
Exa... thank you.

254
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,184
She knew that goin' in.

255
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,278
I haven't changed.

256
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,789
I'm the exact same guy
I advertised in the store window

257
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,812
12 years ago.

258
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:26,847
You bet I'm unemotional.

259
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:27,916
She used to be fine with that.

260
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,949
It was a turn-on.

261
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,723
But suddenly it's not enough
for her anymore,

262
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,752
'cause she turned 40,

263
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,425
and she wants someone to panic with.

264
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,934
And she wants me to cry.

265
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,698
- About what?

266
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:39,761
- It's my choice.

267
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,365
She just wants me to reach down
and fall apart.

268
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,602
- Oould you even do that?

269
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,631
- Are you kiddin' me, Sully?

270
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,666
I'm a guy.

271
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,440
I haven't cried since I went
to Oooperstown.

272
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,674
- The Lou Gehrig speech.

273
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,444
So what's your plan?

274
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,280
- My plan is to stay separated
until she realizes

275
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,308
she can't change me,

276
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,184
gets scared that if she keeps
tryin' to change me,

277
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,485
she's gonna lose me forever,
takes me back as is,

278
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,684
gets used to bein' 40.

279
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:00,851
We live happily ever after.

280
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,155
- Dismissed.

281
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,407
- Becket!

282
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,846
Beck!

283
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,309
- Hey!

284
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,341
- Don't you answer your door?

285
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,978
- You're a crisis addict.
Do you know that?

286
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,010
What is it now?

287
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,454
- This is your crisis this time.

288
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,479
Oome on.

289
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,090
- Okay, what?

290
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,495
- This is your aunt's will.

291
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,520
- What?
No, no, no.

292
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,897
My aunt didn't have a will.

293
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,164
- Well, her good friend Martha Oorn
dropped this off today,

294
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,670
so I checked it out.

295
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,638
This is your aunt's will.

296
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,607
She wrote it herself,

297
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,268
and it's completely legal.

298
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,868
This ain't your house, Beck.

299
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:35,141
- What are you talking about?

300
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,238
I'm her only kin.

301
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,748
I have this house through succession.

302
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,772
- You are her only kin.

303
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,478
- Then who the hell did she
leave the house to?

304
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,214
- The Delano Institute.

305
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,551
I don't know why...
- Why would she...

306
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,716
- But she left it to
a particular department there

307
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:49,158
run by one Dr. Warren Koven.

308
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,162
- Okay, what do we know about
this Koven guy?

309
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,424
- He runs a sleep lab.

310
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,125
- Which is what, exactly?

311
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,532
- I don't know;
I assume it's a lab where people sleep.

312
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,001
And now they've got your house,

313
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,061
I'm sure they're gonna sleep a lot easier.

314
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,306
- So this is a sleep lab.

315
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,476
- Yeah, it's not a typical one.

316
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,078
The Institute had space issues,
and we take the brunt.

317
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,088
But we're very proud of our work.

318
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,350
We're regular contributors

319
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,188
<i>to The Polysomnographic Journal,
and we do treat the uninsured.</i>

320
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,693
- People with problems sleeping.

321
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,717
- Uh, yeah.

322
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,491
Do you have sleep problems, Mr. Becket?

323
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:30,491
- Sometimes.

324
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,663
- Well, we're here to help.

325
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:33,693
Yeah, please take a look.

326
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,400
Ms. Oarl is with us tonight.

327
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,705
She's a sleepwalker,
and we want to know why.

328
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:42,180
- And what was my aunt's problem?

329
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,512
I mean,
I'm assuming that you treated her

330
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,710
for some sort of sleep disorder.

331
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,740
Is that right?

332
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:50,687
- No, actually, she...
she was not a patient here.

333
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:51,984
- Then how did you know her?

334
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,013
- She had an interest

335
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,424
in a different lab
that I run here at the Institute.

336
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,449
- Another sleep lab?

337
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,963
- No, actually, it's a lab
where we conduct special experiments

338
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:02,433
on various topics
of personal interest to me.

339
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,231
- And would that be the lab
that was mentioned in her will?

340
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,238
- Probably.
Yeah.

341
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,832
- Then I believe that's the lab
I'd like to see.

342
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,743
- Three.

343
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:18,977
- Welcome to the Koven Project.

344
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,042
Tonight's concept is a very simple one.

345
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,920
Oassie meditates as random
single-digit numbers pop up

346
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:25,981
on Dillon's screen.

347
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,616
A vibration signal is sent down

348
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,388
into the studio
through this one-way glass

349
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:32,727
to the electronic ball
in Oassie's left hand

350
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,322
where she makes the determination

351
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,027
whether the number
is odd or even.

352
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,730
- She makes a determination about what?

353
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,204
It seems to me it's just a guess, right?

354
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,298
- Well, there we go.

355
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,968
That's the million-dollar question.

356
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,033
Is it a guess?

357
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,601
See, what we're trying to do here,

358
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,613
under the most stringent
conditions ever applied,

359
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:53,175
is to quantify one human being's
psychic ability to read another.

360
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,448
- Oh.

361
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,476
Psychic.

362
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,182
- Well, ESP, to be more general.

363
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,656
- Warren, she's gone below 50%.

364
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,522
- All right.

365
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,152
Excuse me one second.

366
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,184
Derek?

367
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:07,892
I need you to drop the room
to 56 and heat the bed.

368
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,195
- Are you sure you want to do that?

369
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,134
You want to heat the bed?
- Yeah, she won't notice.

370
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,431
She's been down too long.

371
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:13,563
- All right.

372
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,802
- So that's what you study here, ESP.

373
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,139
- Yes, amongst other things,

374
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:21,077
mostly dealing with psi energy
in aural paranormal activity.

375
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,876
- Paranormal activity.

376
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,905
And you're telling me
that my Aunt Marlene

377
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,315
believed in all this stuff?

378
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,340
- Absolutely.

379
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,013
I mean, that's why she's funding us.

380
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,488
See, your aunt experienced
some paranormal disturbances

381
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,512
around the house.

382
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,047
- I'm sorry.
She what?

383
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:37,255
- She experienced paranormal
disturbances in her house.

384
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,695
- Meaning what?

385
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,719
- Well, meaning that she,

386
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,460
you know, she thought the place
was haunted.

387
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,161
- She wasn't serious.

388
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,669
- Oh, no, she was very serious,
very analytical.

389
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,001
She even brought us photographs.

390
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,063
- Photographs of what?

391
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:51,837
- What she believed to be the center
of the disturbance in the house.

392
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:55,643
- This is absurd.

393
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,876
- I believe that's a closet
on the second...

394
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,907
- Yes, I know where it is.

395
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:03,079
Taking pictures of it means...

396
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,646
- I'm not saying her house
is haunted or anything.

397
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,318
But I am saying that she
witnessed sonic...

398
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,621
- Doc.

399
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,649
- Paranormal disturbances,
which is not...

400
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:10,684
- Warren, we got a problem here.

401
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,718
- Oh, shit!

402
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,492
God damn it.

403
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,999
- She fucked up the entire TLS.

404
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,660
- Fuck you!

405
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,328
- Jesus!

406
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,236
- Jesus, she's out of control.
- She's comin' up.

407
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,535
- What?

408
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,335
- Ross.

409
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,573
- I called it.

410
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,581
- You weren't concentrating.
The fulcrum on the...

411
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,310
It sucked?
- No.

412
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,340
- I sucked?
- No, no.

413
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:34,477
Y... no.
You were fine.

414
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,714
I just... you could be so m...
oh!

415
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,188
Oassie!

416
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:39,315
- You lied to me.

417
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,347
- God damn it.

418
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,416
- Understand?

419
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,452
- Oassie, please.

420
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:50,564
- What's in the briefcase?

421
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,661
- Just some New York State
precedents

422
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,831
on the succession of property.

423
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:55,897
Listen...

424
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,272
- I apologize.

425
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,641
It's just, she's very high-strung
but really quite gifted.

426
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,043
She is very gifted.

427
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,103
Hold up, Mr. Becket.

428
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,705
Oould you hold up a second please?

429
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,717
Listen, so the girl's an eccentric.

430
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:06,740
So what?

431
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,412
- You think this is about the girl?

432
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:09,511
It's your entire operation.

433
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,543
- Really?

434
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,489
- Representing to a dying old woman

435
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,755
that you have answers
to questions you don't have?

436
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,888
Giving supernatural significance
to noises in her house?

437
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,919
- No, not supernatural.

438
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,398
Natural.

439
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,698
- We told her we could give natural,
scientific explanations

440
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,226
to whatever she heard.

441
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,898
- Scientific, paranormal, ESP,
psychic...

442
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,702
- Yes, they're as scientific as gravity.

443
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,265
They're just not yet fully understood.

444
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,436
Go look up
the US military Stargate Project,

445
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,809
their Sony Zesper lab.

446
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:35,904
Don't get me wrong.

447
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,380
We're not looking for ghosts here.

448
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,440
What we do is science.

449
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,782
- I know a little bit
about accepted science, Doctor.

450
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,653
Who is officially behind
your mind reading lab here at DIT?

451
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,020
- Oh, I get it.

452
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,115
You're contesting the will.

453
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,456
That's what this is really about.

454
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,858
You didn't get the money.

455
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,420
- No, what this is about
is you taking advantage

456
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,455
of an old woman whose faculties
were failing.

457
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:55,488
- Faculties?

458
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,195
She was more lucid than you.
- Tell you what.

459
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:01,729
Wear a blue suit when you
sell that to the jury.

460
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,468
- You're a close-minded man, Mr. Becket.

461
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,271
- And why is that, Doctor?

462
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,974
Because I don't happen to think
your fringe lab is the real deal?

463
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,380
- No, because you don't think.

464
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,940
You know.

465
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,248
And that's where
you give yourself away.

466
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,810
"Though I walk through the valley

467
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,544
of the shadow of death"...

468
00:25:54,819 --> 00:26:01,622
"The demon walks here. "

469
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,392
Hey, hey!

470
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:07,796
Hey!

471
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,424
Hey!

472
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:43,126
- Why is he sent?

473
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:02,712
Do you believe it's him?

474
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:03,948
Please.

475
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:04,978
What does he want?

476
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,047
- What does he want here?

477
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,183
- That's...

478
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,372
- 911.
What's your emergency?

479
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,778
- There's someone in my house.

480
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,803
- What did you say, sir?

481
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:31,838
Someone in the house?

482
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,214
- Yes.

483
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:40,418
In the trunk.

484
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,594
Look in the trunk.

485
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:50,032
Old trunk.

486
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:55,071
Old trunk.

487
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,232
- Hey!

488
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,434
Hey!

489
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,650
- Get rid of the flake factor.

490
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,848
- Oh.

491
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,050
- May I talk to you for a minute?

492
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:18,324
- Give me the room, would you, guys?

493
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,231
- First of all, I'd like to apologize
for last night.

494
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,929
I came on too strong.

495
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:26,129
And for that I'm sorry.

496
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,331
- Hmm.

497
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,532
Did something happen?

498
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:29,631
- Let's just say

499
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:33,166
that I now understand how my aunt
could have become confused

500
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,678
and thought her place was haunted.

501
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,271
I thought I heard something
there myself last night.

502
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,078
I'm staying there
until the estate is settled.

503
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,106
- What did you hear?

504
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,585
- Whispering outside my door.

505
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,281
I do not believe in ghosts.

506
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,950
And I got the sense
that you don't either.

507
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:47,980
- I don't.

508
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,687
I don't believe
in anything supernatural.

509
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,161
- Then we're kindred spirits.

510
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,825
But that still leaves me
short of an answer.

511
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:55,855
- Meh.

512
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,733
Sit.

513
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,764
The human voice
is not real complex.

514
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,138
It's a sound that nature

515
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:07,303
has very little difficulty mimicking.

516
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:11,042
Now, what I'm gonna play for you is real.

517
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:15,485
It was recorded in a farmhouse
in the Berkshires, 1976.

518
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,455
It was heard by multiple witnesses,
caught on tape,

519
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,479
sworn to in an affidavit.

520
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:20,513
Okay?

521
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:21,547
It's the real McOoy.

522
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,582
Please.

523
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,674
Isn't that amazing?

524
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:46,480
This is an authentic aural event.

525
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,247
And it's probably what we call
a chi cluster.

526
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,516
It's a buildup of chi field energy,

527
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,182
then released
into the sonic spectrum.

528
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,485
- But it's not words.

529
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,514
- What do you mean?

530
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,790
- How does it come out as words,
you know,

531
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,820
in an intelligent sentence structure?

532
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,388
- Well, it doesn't.

533
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:02,956
I mean, maybe it does
once in a million,

534
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,730
like those monkeys
typing sonnets, but...

535
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:08,535
- No, but it did for me.

536
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,507
The voice that I heard spoke.

537
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,102
It did not just say,
"Ooh, aah, aah. "

538
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:18,548
It said something like
"an old trunk. "

539
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,710
And it kept repeating it
over and over.

540
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:26,384
"An old trunk" or "in an old trunk"
as if to suggest that I...

541
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:27,482
- Bryan, is it?

542
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,514
- Yeah.

543
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,551
- How well can you hear
through a door?

544
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,721
- Pretty well, I guess.

545
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,628
Okay, now, what was the volume like?

546
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,657
- Like I'm talking now?

547
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,225
- Maybe a little lower.

548
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,896
- You know,
I'm gonna tell you what you did,

549
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,738
and I don't want you to get embarrassed,
because you're not the first.

550
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:46,403
But you heard whispering sounds.

551
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,105
And presuming that they must be human,

552
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,637
your brain strove
to put speech to them.

553
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,981
So "old trunk," or "in the old trunk"
was the best it could come up with.

554
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,952
It's called psychoacoustics.

555
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,249
Excuse me.

556
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,277
- Really.

557
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,483
I respect the concept.

558
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,219
I really do.

559
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,851
But I don't know.

560
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,089
- What I heard was so...

561
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,654
- What'd I say?

562
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,688
- What?

563
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,428
- Oh, did you catch that?

564
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,457
- Yeah.

565
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:12,491
You said, "What'd I say?"

566
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,526
- No, I didn't.

567
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:14,560
I said, "Rud lie stay. "

568
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,507
Rud lie stay.

569
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,567
You made it into
"what'd I say. "

570
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,840
- Huh.

571
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:24,871
Shit.

572
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,076
- Your aunt did the same thing.

573
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,881
She took a garden variety
acoustical sub-event

574
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,182
and made it into a haunting.

575
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:32,813
I'll be damned.

576
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:33,915
- You're surprised, huh?

577
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,687
You thought I'd accept your
hearing voices

578
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,251
as an everyday thing, didn't you?

579
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,820
- No, I thought it was an
everyday thing for you people.

580
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:46,798
Don't they have nuns
for that kind of work?

581
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:49,467
Oareful.

582
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:50,769
You'll get me in trouble.

583
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,799
- I'm late for our meeting, Father.

584
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:53,868
My apologies.

585
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,106
- You know, some people would say

586
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,704
being late for a meeting
with a priest

587
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,741
shows a subconscious hostility
towards the church.

588
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,810
- You think it's subconscious?

589
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,253
What'd you want to see me about?

590
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,278
- Your aunt's place.

591
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:10,420
I drove by there last night,
and I saw some lights on,

592
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:14,192
and I was very curious about
who you were letting stay there.

593
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,961
- I'm stayin' there.

594
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,124
- You are?

595
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,693
- Yeah.

596
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,728
Robin and I are taking
a little breather.

597
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,762
Why, is somethin' wrong?

598
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:26,072
- Oh, you're gonna think
I'm silly for even saying this.

599
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,907
- Oh, I think half what you say
is silly anyway.

600
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,641
It's part of your charm.

601
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,807
So what is it?

602
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,646
- Be careful in that house.

603
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:35,975
- What does that mean?

604
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,009
- It means

605
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:40,388
there's something not quite
right there.

606
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,019
- Are you tryin' to tell me you
think the house is haunted?

607
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,052
- You don't believe
in haunted houses, do you?

608
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,825
- No, I do not.

609
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,525
- Do you believe in evil?

610
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:49,555
- No, I do not.

611
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,932
- Your aunt believed
that the place was haunted.

612
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,562
- Would you like to know how I see

613
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,572
this whole haunted house business?

614
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,506
- Yes, I would.

615
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,033
- My aunt in her younger, stronger days

616
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:03,275
would never have fallen prey
to superstition.

617
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,681
But at 81, in failing health,

618
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:10,586
living all alone in a great big house
with lots of memories,

619
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:13,784
some regrets, no doubt,
when she heard something,

620
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,190
whatever it was,

621
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,353
she was ripe to run with it.

622
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,384
Now, you mix that in

623
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:23,128
with hardening of the arteries,
you have yourself a ghost story.

624
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,725
- You're a good lawyer, Becket.

625
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,134
- I'm a doubting Thomas, Father.

626
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,159
No offense.

627
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,297
It's just in my nature.

628
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,034
- None taken.

629
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,439
- Still, it's always good to see you.

630
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:34,934
- And you, my friend.

631
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,412
Just remember one thing, Becket.

632
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,777
Thomas was wrong.

633
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,082
- Ah!

634
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,021
- Jeez.

635
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,719
You are such a dick.

636
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,590
- You shouldn't leave
the front door unlocked.

637
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,592
You scared the shit out of me.

638
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,690
- Ah.

639
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,859
Where were you this morning?

640
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:34,668
- Huh?

641
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,002
Oh, God!

642
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,803
Damn it.

643
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,139
God damn it!

644
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,805
I missed the conference
with Judge Akagi.

645
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,143
Oh, shit.

646
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,170
Aw, I'm sorry.

647
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,273
- Screw sorry.

648
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:46,510
What's goin' on with you?

649
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,348
- Nothin's goin' on with me, Sully.

650
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:49,375
I missed a meeting.

651
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,409
I can't miss one meeting?

652
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,979
- No, you cannot miss one meeting.

653
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,012
And do you know why?

654
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,218
'Oause you're a control freak
who doesn't miss anything.

655
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,454
You missin' one meeting is like
a regular guy missin'

656
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:58,894
his own frickin' wedding.

657
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,455
And now I'm good and worried.

658
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,899
Yeah, 'cause I think you're
havin' some kind of breakdown.

659
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:04,924
- Oh, get out of here.

660
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:05,958
I'm not havin' a breakdown.

661
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:06,992
- Oh, how would you know?

662
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,938
See, people that are havin'
a breakdown don't know

663
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,235
that they're havin' a breakdown.

664
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,764
They just think the water tastes funny.

665
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:12,867
You left your wife.

666
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,207
You left your son,

667
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,872
both of who I know you adore.

668
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,040
You move into this creepy old house.

669
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:19,709
And then you miss a meeting.

670
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,218
- Okay, I will never miss
another meeting.

671
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,447
That's an oath.

672
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,546
- Becks,

673
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,558
you have amazed me
for 111/2 years straight.

674
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,583
So if you need a break,

675
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,458
you raise your hand.

676
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,054
You don't have to be
the good dog that runs

677
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,156
until his heart explodes.

678
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:45,133
Look, I'm sorry I had to bust your balls.

679
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,336
Need a hug?

680
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,174
Not from you.

681
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,272
- Well, check your inventory, pal.

682
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,612
I'm all you got left.

683
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,783
- Hm.

684
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:31,811
Old trunk.

685
00:36:56,647 --> 00:37:01,584
Well, my dear Watson,

686
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:06,215
what do you suppose
is in the old trunk?

687
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:12,287
The remains of someone murdered
in this house perhaps?

688
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,383
Bryan.

689
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:34,208
- Who's in here?

690
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:37,681
Who's in my house?

691
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:18,820
- I want your lab work Friday, okay?

692
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,323
Oh, yeah,
and I need the correlation

693
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,451
between night terrors
and serotonin level.

694
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:23,858
We already spoke about that.

695
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,304
- I saw something this time.

696
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:37,830
A woman at the bottom of the stairs.

697
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,207
She was just sitting there.

698
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:42,576
There's no woman in my house, Doctor.

699
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:45,810
It's empty except for me.

700
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:50,082
So what did I see?

701
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,818
- I have no idea.

702
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:57,453
- Are you telling me that no one
has ever reported seeing something?

703
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,122
- Yeah.

704
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,289
Not that held up.

705
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,265
- Held up?

706
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,128
- I know this is difficult,

707
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:09,606
but is there any history
of mental illness in your family?

708
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,666
- Are you serious?

709
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,041
You're serious.

710
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,912
You're tryin' to pin this on me?

711
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,814
- I'm not trying to pin anything on anyone.

712
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,820
But as rational people,
we need to look at every possibility.

713
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,151
- I am not a possibility.

714
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:26,178
- So your answer's no.

715
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,212
There's no history.

716
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,282
- That's right.

717
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:30,156
- All right, so just...
there's no schizophrenia?

718
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,183
- No.

719
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:32,217
- Hallucinations?
- No.

720
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,252
- Manic depression?

721
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,530
- Any bipolar disorders, Bryan?

722
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,866
- One uncle, maybe.

723
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:40,893
So what?

724
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,065
- Well, I'm just going off a list.

725
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,234
But if there's any familial history at all,

726
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:49,679
and you've had this episode,
I think you should see someone.

727
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,378
You think I should see someone.

728
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:54,475
- I do, I do.

729
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:55,507
And I know a very good man...

730
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:59,319
- How dare you try to pin this on me?

731
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,790
I happen to be, Doctor,

732
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,886
one of the most boringly sane people

733
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:08,421
that you have ever fucking met!

734
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:25,447
Tell him it's Bryan Becket.

735
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:00,214
I just don't get the way
we dress kids for Halloween.

736
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,616
Murder victims, Lizzie Borden.

737
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,449
And then we stand back
and snap pictures of it all

738
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,216
as though it's something
we should cherish

739
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,087
right up there with our first communion.

740
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,921
- What's troubling you, my friend?

741
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,221
- Oh, just my usual.

742
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,250
Insomnia.

743
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,990
- Ah, well, we can fix that.

744
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:17,228
- Hey, Doc,
when you have persistent insomnia,

745
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,599
can it lead to other symptoms?

746
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,161
- Sure.
What kind of symptoms?

747
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,968
- Hallucinations.

748
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:27,305
- You've been having hallucinations, Bryan?

749
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:28,333
- Just one.

750
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,371
Maybe I was sleepwalking,
and I saw something

751
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,383
sort of ghostlike, I guess.

752
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,078
I flicked on the light,
and it disappeared.

753
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,108
- Yeah, yeah.

754
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:39,987
Sleep deprivations can cause
hallucinations, definitely.

755
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,616
But if it occurs again,
you'll let me know?

756
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:42,648
All right?

757
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:43,717
- All right.

758
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,729
- Why aren't you sleeping?
- Work.

759
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,060
It's brutal right now.

760
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,928
Tons of big cases.

761
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:53,198
And on top of that,
Robin and I are separated.

762
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,829
- Oh?

763
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,601
- Yeah, I think with Robin and me,

764
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,665
it's a game of marital chicken,
you know?

765
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,506
Just give each other
a good scare and move on.

766
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:01,670
I think we'll be all right.

767
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:02,906
- Yes, I think it'll work out.

768
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:03,936
You're a good couple.

769
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,006
- But in the meantime,
I moved into my aunt's house.

770
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,315
And I got to tell you,
I haven't been alone in...

771
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,945
- I'm sorry.
You moved where?

772
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,455
- To my aunt's house for now.

773
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,081
- Oh.

774
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:16,524
And is that where you had
this hallucination?

775
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,584
- Yep.

776
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:24,397
- And this ghostlike image,
was it male or female?

777
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,699
- It was a woman.

778
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:27,829
- Oh.

779
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:31,466
Was there anything about this woman
that was interesting or odd?

780
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:35,877
Anything about her face
or her eyes?

781
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:38,347
- I couldn't say.

782
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:39,849
I just saw it from the back.

783
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:40,975
- It?

784
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,785
- Her.

785
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,313
Her.

786
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:49,381
Excuse me.

787
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,223
I was just struck with the memory

788
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:55,027
of the first time your father
brought you here.

789
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,363
It was just after your mother passed.

790
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:00,063
I was new to my profession,
unsure of myself.

791
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:03,301
And you were this
precocious little guy

792
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,069
who looked at my diploma wall
and asked

793
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,304
why I hadn't been
to one of the top med schools.

794
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,608
- Oh, Jesus.

795
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,636
Did I?

796
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,581
- Yeah, we did good work though.

797
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:13,844
We were making progress.

798
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,875
And then...

799
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:19,514
well, I always thought your father
pulled you out too soon.

800
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:20,818
- My dad hated shrinks.

801
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,827
I think he feared that if you
poked around in my head,

802
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,022
you might discover some
deep family secret.

803
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:27,553
- Hmm.

804
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:31,466
Well, whatever the reason,
I think you came out of it too soon.

805
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,526
- Hence my insomnia.

806
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:33,866
- And your issues with death.

807
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,269
What I think you need...

808
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:37,170
- Is to spend more time on your couch.

809
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,196
Yeah, I know.

810
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:39,903
You suggest that every year.

811
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:41,433
- Well, what do you think of it this year?

812
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,969
- I think you drive a fancy enough car.

813
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,572
You don't need another patient.

814
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:47,875
- Ooh.

815
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,249
You're getting better.

816
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:50,913
- Thanks, Doc.

817
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,514
Appreciate it.

818
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:58,450
It's funny though.

819
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,861
You mentioned my mother.

820
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,763
It's sad.

821
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,735
I can barely remember her.

822
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:11,036
Except for tidbits,

823
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,235
there's nothing.

824
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,834
- She's in there, Bryan.

825
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,437
She's in there.

826
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,489
- Ver Staaten.

827
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:11,694
Dr. Shepard.

828
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:15,364
Okay, I'll be right there.

829
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:16,394
Hi.

830
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,601
Hey, you.

831
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,041
I can't do this right now.

832
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:21,874
I have a meeting.

833
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,277
This is for him.

834
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:26,407
He thinks you left us
for another family.

835
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,678
Oome on.

836
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:35,947
- You a werewolf?

837
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,460
Whoa.

838
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:38,586
Scary werewolf.

839
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,618
No.

840
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:40,652
Not scary.

841
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:41,891
- Oh, okay, not scary.

842
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,399
There's nobody here but me, pal.

843
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,799
Do you want to look for yourself?

844
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,030
You want to explore?

845
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,059
Okay.

846
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:49,094
Hurry up.

847
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,767
Dad's got a meeting.

848
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,203
- What are you doing here?

849
00:46:58,248 --> 00:46:59,840
- We need some time apart, Robin.

850
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,248
- I want us in therapy.

851
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,445
- Therapy.

852
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,181
- Yeah.

853
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:05,916
- I have my doubts about therapy.

854
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,719
- Oh, you have your doubts
about everything.

855
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:10,556
All you do all day is have doubts
about what everyone else thinks.

856
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:11,856
- Well, uh, what would you rather, Robin,

857
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,260
I was one a those fanatics
who was certain?

858
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:16,391
- You are every bit as certain
as any fanatic I've ever seen.

859
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:17,491
- Okay, that's absurd.

860
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,525
That is an absurd thing to say.

861
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,731
I am not certain about anything,
and if you can't see that,

862
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,672
we're even farther apart
than I thought we were.

863
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:24,833
- So what do you call it then

864
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,775
when you are so positive
the rest of us are wrong,

865
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,107
flawed in our thinking?

866
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:30,136
I call that certain, arrogant.

867
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,546
And I don't think it's 'cause
you're smarter than anyone else.

868
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:33,777
I think it's 'cause you're lost.

869
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:35,011
- Well, guess what, Robin.

870
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:36,383
I hardly care what you think,

871
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,615
'cause I got trial in the morning,
I lost my expert,

872
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,088
and I got a 200 page deposition...

873
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:42,387
- Is it your mother?

874
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,018
- What?

875
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,586
- I said, is it your mother?

876
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:52,535
Is that why you're messed up,
'cause of what happened to her,

877
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,265
'cause of what you saw that day?

878
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:57,500
- My mother died when I was five.

879
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,065
I barely remember her.

880
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:00,303
- I don't believe it.

881
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:01,572
- Oh, you think I'm lying?

882
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:03,807
- I think that you've buried stuff.

883
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:05,508
I think that you saw more
that day in Boston

884
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,538
than they told you.

885
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,244
- All right, you know what we're
not gonna do?

886
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:11,118
We are not going to play
psychobabble with my head.

887
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,143
- Listen...

888
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:13,986
- My mother is not the problem
with our marriage.

889
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:16,424
So for you to try to pin it on a woman
who's been dead for 38 years...

890
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,928
- Do you know you
talk about her in your sleep?

891
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:21,590
- I what?

892
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,156
- And I've never told you before,

893
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,065
because I thought it would
make things worse.

894
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:27,263
When you talk about her,

895
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:28,635
you talk about her face.

896
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:30,162
All right, God damn it, that's enough.

897
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,196
Let this alone!

898
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,401
- This is the shit that is
ruining our marriage!

899
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:34,842
- No, you're doing it,
because you won't stop.

900
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:36,778
- You sit up in bed like a child

901
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:38,974
terrified,
staring across the room.

902
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,415
You know what you're looking at?

903
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:41,439
You're looking at her!

904
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,474
You see her!

905
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:43,645
- Stop this!

906
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:45,710
- Mama!

907
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,950
- Michael!

908
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,082
- Michael?
- Where is he?

909
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,353
- Michael!

910
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,554
Michael!

911
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,862
- Baby?

912
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:05,500
- Someone's in the closet.

913
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:06,531
- What?

914
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,812
- They said my name.

915
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:11,370
- Oh, no, sweetheart.

916
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:12,712
There's nobody here but Daddy.

917
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,273
- Maybe it's a ghost.

918
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:15,376
- Oh, no, baby.

919
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:18,547
Remember what Daddy and I
told you about ghosts?

920
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:21,557
So what did Daddy and I
tell you about ghosts?

921
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:22,580
Daddy?

922
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,184
What did we tell Michael about ghosts?

923
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:26,851
- They're not real.

924
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,228
- They're not real.

925
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:29,254
Okay?

926
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,358
It's just your imagination again,
sweet pie.

927
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:32,561
- Oome here, pal.

928
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:42,410
They sure do seem real
sometimes though, don't they?

929
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,162
- Hmm.

930
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:06,692
Sully.

931
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:33,628
Oh, come on.

932
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:57,109
Oh, Jesus Ohrist!

933
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:00,488
It's you.

934
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,458
- So this is the big, bad, house, huh?

935
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,460
I might be too nervous to come in.

936
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:07,520
- Nobody asked you in.

937
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,228
What, are you plannin'
on spending the night?

938
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:12,257
- Uh-huh.

939
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:13,769
I heard you saw something here.

940
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,032
And I'm intrigued.

941
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,801
- What I saw was not real.

942
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:19,772
Excuse me.

943
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,300
Excuse me.

944
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:23,107
You can't just walk in here.

945
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:24,443
Hey!

946
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,472
What do you think you're doing?

947
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:30,646
This is my house.

948
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,120
- There's something here.

949
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:33,554
- Okay.

950
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,579
What?

951
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:36,023
What do you think I saw?

952
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,356
- A ghost.

953
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:38,827
- I don't believe in ghosts.

954
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,989
- Well, that's ironic,
since you're the one that saw it.

955
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,864
- What I saw was a hallucination
caused by sleep deprivation.

956
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,889
- Yeah.

957
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:45,993
My shrink would say that too.

958
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:50,163
Look, it's not as out there
as it seems, you know,

959
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,799
the whole ghost thing.

960
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:55,505
In fact, 46% of the people
in this country believe in ghosts.

961
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:58,844
46% of the people in this country
can't find Europe on a map.

962
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,144
- Oh, wow.

963
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,172
You know something?

964
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:04,187
You're very arrogant.

965
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,279
- I'm sorry.

966
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:06,311
- Don't be.

967
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:07,345
I like that.

968
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:09,985
- You still can't stay.

969
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:11,891
- You're a lawyer, right?

970
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:13,156
- Yes.

971
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:15,061
- That means you get off on logic, proof.

972
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:17,032
- I don't know if I get off on
them, but...

973
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,558
- Even Koven, the fool,
believes I'm psychic.

974
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:20,934
- I don't believe in ESP.

975
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:21,960
- No, no, no.

976
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:25,168
You're missing my point.

977
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,733
You saw something here.

978
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:34,580
So just suppose for a moment
you let me stay and I see something too.

979
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,552
And since you haven't described
what you saw

980
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:39,077
except as a woman at the bottom
of some stairs,

981
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:45,925
then if I see her too,
and I could describe her, well,

982
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:50,331
I mean, that would be proof
of something, wouldn't it?

983
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,267
Good proof.

984
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:53,929
- You can have this bedroom
right over here.

985
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,028
It's got its own bath.

986
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,733
I'll be up on the third floor
if you need s...

987
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:01,467
Oh, no.

988
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,479
No, no.
I'm sorry.

989
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,639
This was my aunt's room,

990
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:05,737
the one that died.

991
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:06,771
- Oh.

992
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:08,306
So it's vacant.

993
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,319
- Yeah.
Right.

994
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:13,151
Whatever.

995
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,350
Hey, let me ask you something.

996
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,757
How does a girl your age
get a brand-new Porsche?

997
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:17,782
- I come from money.

998
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:18,953
- And your folks?

999
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:20,895
- My mother ran away when I was six,

1000
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,421
and my father passed away
this summer.

1001
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:23,454
- Hmm.

1002
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,933
I'm sorry then about your
father.

1003
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:26,128
- No, don't be.

1004
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,932
- What, you two weren't close?

1005
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:31,407
- Not in a good way.

1006
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:34,907
- Do you have siblings?

1007
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:35,934
- Yeah, I have a brother.

1008
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:38,447
He's in a mental institution.

1009
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,244
He's been there since he was 13.

1010
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:42,945
And you probably figured
I was the black sheep.

1011
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:46,649
I don't mean to be rude or anything,
but I'm gonna...

1012
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,952
- Go do what you do.

1013
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:48,980
- Thanks.

1014
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,792
- Jesus Ohrist!

1015
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,074
- Someone died in here.

1016
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,238
A man.

1017
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:14,079
Oh.

1018
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:16,347
His head.

1019
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:19,082
Severe pain.

1020
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:20,589
- My aunt's husband, my Uncle Ohet,

1021
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:25,459
died in this house 25 years ago
of a cerebral hemorrhage.

1022
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:27,019
I don't know where in the house exactly.

1023
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,963
- It was here.

1024
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,832
- How do you know that?

1025
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,961
There are a lot of people
who could have told you that.

1026
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:37,869
- Nobody told me anything.

1027
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:47,205
That's fine.

1028
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:51,346
Thank you.

1029
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:56,855
- I'm glad you didn't sit in that chair.

1030
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:58,292
It's funny.

1031
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:00,319
The other night I walked past
that mirror down there,

1032
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:03,059
and I could've sworn
I saw someone in that chair.

1033
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,431
You know, for someone who scorns
the paranormal,

1034
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,595
you sure do report a lot of incidents.

1035
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:18,805
- What the fuck was that?

1036
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,645
- The house is waking up.

1037
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:23,710
I got to get some things.

1038
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,084
Oh, wow.

1039
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,315
- Leave it.
Leave it.

1040
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,381
I'll get it.

1041
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:29,414
- Are you gonna help me?

1042
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:30,448
I can use your help.

1043
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,120
- Uh...

1044
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,652
You know what?

1045
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:35,130
Why don't you think about it?

1046
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,099
I'll be downstairs soon.

1047
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:39,397
- You know,
I have a trial in the morning.

1048
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:42,894
This is not usually the way I prepare.

1049
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:04,017
- Agh.

1050
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:06,822
- Oassie, Oassie!

1051
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:09,256
Oassie!

1052
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:10,288
- What?

1053
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:11,322
- Did you hear that?

1054
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,426
- All I heard was you yelling.

1055
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,460
- You didn't hear someone
falling down the stairs?

1056
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:15,937
- Oh, God, no.

1057
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:17,405
- You didn't hear that?

1058
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,034
- Oh, that's weird.

1059
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,304
The house talks

1060
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:23,574
but only to you.

1061
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,080
- Or I'm talking to myself.

1062
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:27,106
- Don't do that.

1063
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,742
You're not imagining things, Bryan.

1064
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:32,346
Why would you all of a sudden imagine
someone falling down a flight of stairs?

1065
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,358
- My mother died falling down
a flight of stairs.

1066
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,475
- Wait.

1067
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,500
- What is it?

1068
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:58,673
- Something's moving in the house.

1069
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,307
Do you feel it?

1070
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:02,682
- Me?

1071
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:11,454
Upstairs to the right.

1072
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:54,236
Oassie, are you all right?

1073
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,259
- I'm fine.

1074
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,294
- What the hell was that?

1075
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:57,328
- That was a warning.

1076
00:57:57,373 --> 00:58:00,069
Whatever is in this house
wants me to mind my business.

1077
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:01,133
- Well, are you gonna?

1078
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:04,808
- We're done with this.

1079
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:05,906
Leave that light on.

1080
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:07,678
This house needs all the light
that it can get.

1081
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:08,741
- Yeah, good.

1082
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:11,618
Don't know why you wanted 'em
off in the first place.

1083
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:16,321
What?

1084
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:18,953
What is it?

1085
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:22,487
- The stairs where you saw the woman.

1086
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:25,023
They're the ones back there,
aren't they?

1087
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:28,060
- Yeah.

1088
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,102
Oassie,

1089
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:35,770
this is where I step off, okay?

1090
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:42,081
I just have too much work to do,
all right?

1091
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:43,380
Oassie?

1092
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:46,617
Are you all right with that?

1093
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:52,117
Oassie?

1094
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,890
Oassie?

1095
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:21,118
Why are you lookin' at me like that?

1096
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:26,859
- You don't know, do you?

1097
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,592
- What?

1098
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:30,621
- Who she was,

1099
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:33,659
the woman you saw.

1100
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:35,068
Bryan,

1101
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:37,004
it was your mother.

1102
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:39,634
- What?

1103
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:41,735
Helen, I think, or...

1104
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:44,008
- Helena.

1105
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:45,844
- Helena.

1106
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:47,941
Yeah.

1107
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:49,781
Helena Margaret.

1108
00:59:55,892 --> 01:00:01,228
Something about her frightens you,

1109
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,391
something about her face.

1110
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:11,206
Your mother died falling down stairs,
you said.

1111
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,229
Where?

1112
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,641
- At our house outside Boston.

1113
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:15,974
- Where in Boston?

1114
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,172
Where in Boston exactly?

1115
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:18,202
- Near Braintree.

1116
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:19,236
We moved just after.

1117
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:23,709
- That's interesting.

1118
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:30,124
You should come with me.

1119
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,787
Please.

1120
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,031
I don't know why you've been
told what you have, Bryan,

1121
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:48,169
but your mother fell here,

1122
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:50,372
down these stairs.

1123
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:53,075
- What?

1124
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:56,609
No.

1125
01:00:56,653 --> 01:01:00,020
That doesn't make any sense.

1126
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:01,546
They told me that it...

1127
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:02,580
- They told you what?

1128
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:07,187
- She fell in our...
in our house in Boston.

1129
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,721
Why in God's name would they
keep something like that from me?

1130
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:12,701
- Maybe it wasn't in God's name
they kept it.

1131
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:14,760
There's a very bad secret
in this house.

1132
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:16,738
I know that much.

1133
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:21,176
And if you want me to help you
find it, I will.

1134
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,973
But it might get worse before it get...

1135
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,001
- I want to know.

1136
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:26,015
- All right.
Then you got to help me.

1137
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:28,040
You got to tell me what you remember
about your mother.

1138
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:29,073
- Not much.

1139
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:32,815
I've never had much memory of her.

1140
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,186
She used to fight with my aunt a lot.

1141
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:35,212
- About what?

1142
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:36,247
- I don't know.

1143
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,599
- Do you remember the day she died?

1144
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:48,932
- Pieces.

1145
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,432
- Did you see her fall?

1146
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:53,942
- No.

1147
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:55,409
But I...

1148
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:56,434
- What?

1149
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:58,242
Tell me.

1150
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:03,082
- I heard it.

1151
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:07,112
I heard her fall.

1152
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:11,718
It's a horrible sound,
somebody fallin' down a flight of stairs.

1153
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,786
- Do you remember what you were doing
when you heard it?

1154
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,127
- I was playing.

1155
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:16,153
Where?

1156
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:23,002
- In my room over there.

1157
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,973
Oh, my God.

1158
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:27,100
That was my room.

1159
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,097
Oh, God!

1160
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:54,569
Oh, God!

1161
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:03,044
I don't remember.

1162
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,410
I just feel it.

1163
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:06,505
- It's all right, Bryan.

1164
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:07,675
It's all right.

1165
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:09,344
- I just know it happened in there

1166
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:14,049
and that it happened to me.

1167
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:17,756
Do you know?

1168
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,056
- No, I don't.

1169
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:20,153
- Do you know what it was?

1170
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:21,185
- No.

1171
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:47,385
They say that the unknown
is more frightening than any reality.

1172
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:49,220
- Yes.

1173
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:53,957
- Therefore, I should be less scared
once we open this than I am now.

1174
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:56,726
- That's the theory.

1175
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:02,399
- Huh.

1176
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:07,437
Huh.

1177
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:16,113
- Does anything here
mean anything to you?

1178
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:17,915
- No.

1179
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:22,391
I assume it's stuff
that belonged to my aunt

1180
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:24,985
or my mother.

1181
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,722
But none of it means anything to me.

1182
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:28,855
- Maybe it's the wrong trunk.

1183
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:34,759
Oh.

1184
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,965
Bryan, look at h...

1185
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,375
What is it?

1186
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:43,242
- Get it away.

1187
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:46,437
- You mean...

1188
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:48,450
- Get it away!
Get it away!

1189
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:49,473
- All right.
- Get it away!

1190
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:50,780
Right.
- Get it away!

1191
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,082
- Bryan, it's away.

1192
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:53,679
What is it?

1193
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,226
- I don't know.

1194
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:06,299
It moves, I think.

1195
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:09,566
It floats through the house.

1196
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,938
It does horrible things.

1197
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:14,567
- What, the doll?

1198
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:17,511
- It's not a doll.

1199
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:28,991
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to laugh.

1200
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,549
It's just, did you see
the look on her face

1201
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,788
when we found her hiding spot?

1202
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:41,670
Oh, God.

1203
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:45,538
The look on her face was priceless.

1204
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:50,443
It was absolutely priceless.

1205
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,489
- Good morning.

1206
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:08,259
Eggs, coffee?

1207
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:12,029
- Ooffee would be great.

1208
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:13,057
- How'd you sleep?

1209
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:16,970
- Oh, I slept like a baby,

1210
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:18,667
a baby that's fearing crib death,
that is.

1211
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:26,910
I'm not crazy.

1212
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:28,473
- I agree.

1213
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:30,542
- What happened last night, I think,

1214
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:34,022
is that I've been so sleep deprived
from months of insomnia

1215
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:36,251
that when I mixed in the alcohol
and the sedatives,

1216
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:37,281
I made myself unstable.

1217
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:38,884
You know,
my doctor's already confirmed

1218
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:41,590
that insomnia alone can cause
transitory psychotic symptoms, so...

1219
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:42,722
- My God.

1220
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:45,029
You are one diehard rationalist.

1221
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:46,591
- Well, what the hell's the alternative?

1222
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:48,193
Dolls come to life?

1223
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:50,398
- No, they can be possessed.

1224
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,532
- Oh, stop it.

1225
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:55,442
- Bryan, you're not crazy.

1226
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:58,106
You're not the type.

1227
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:00,206
Something supernatural
is happening to you.

1228
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:02,843
And your episode last night,

1229
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:05,649
I think it was some
kind of vision spell.

1230
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:10,954
- Don't scoff at what you don't know,
and you don't know anything.

1231
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:14,121
You witnessed something
in this house a long time ago.

1232
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:15,528
And whatever is here,

1233
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:18,931
maybe your mother
is tryin' to tell you about it.

1234
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:21,300
Give me one last chance
to dig it out, okay?

1235
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:22,929
I can be back here tomorrow.

1236
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:25,167
And if you need me,
you can just call me.

1237
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:26,196
- Tomorrow?

1238
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,334
- Yeah.

1239
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,276
- You expect me to spend another
night here alone?

1240
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:30,744
I'm shaking at breakfast.

1241
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,510
Bryan, if whatever is in this
house wanted to hurt you,

1242
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:36,848
it would have already.

1243
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,319
- You're sure, huh?

1244
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:40,447
- Oh, yeah.

1245
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:41,513
Yeah.

1246
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:51,855
- Mornin', Father.

1247
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,801
Need a lift?
- No, no.

1248
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:54,825
I have a question.

1249
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:55,859
- Okay.

1250
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:56,997
- Who's the woman at the house?

1251
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:00,575
- You've been spyin' on me?

1252
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:01,735
- Yes, I have.

1253
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:04,841
- She's a psychic.

1254
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,611
She's been helping me remember
things about the place.

1255
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:10,312
- You want to remember that place?

1256
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:13,150
Oome on in to the rectory.

1257
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,384
What are you remembering?

1258
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:16,618
- We lived there for a time.

1259
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:17,819
My mother died there.

1260
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,851
- Where did you find the psychic?

1261
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:21,021
- It's more like she found me.

1262
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:23,657
She heard that I saw something
in the...

1263
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:25,724
- Hmm?

1264
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:31,866
- I hallucinated something
in the house.

1265
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:34,808
I saw my mother.

1266
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:38,371
Shepard assures me it's just
sleep deprivation.

1267
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,439
- You've been sleep deprived before.

1268
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:41,950
Ever see anything?

1269
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:43,849
- No.

1270
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,911
- Well, that's interesting,

1271
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,651
because I remember
the first time you saw her.

1272
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:50,386
- Pardon?

1273
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:52,860
- Eight days after she was buried.

1274
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:54,157
- Is that true?

1275
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:56,289
- That time frightened you so badly

1276
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:57,799
it led to a breakdown

1277
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:00,301
and to them having to get you away
from the house permanently.

1278
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:03,669
Your father sold it
to your aunt and uncle

1279
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,901
and then bought the one up
in Farmbrook for the two of you.

1280
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:07,067
- That's what happened.

1281
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:10,704
- Of course,
everyone dismissed what you saw

1282
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:12,646
until something happened to your uncle.

1283
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:14,876
I don't know exactly what happened,

1284
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:19,377
but he became thoroughly convinced
that there was a presence in the house.

1285
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:21,855
- The shrine in the closet.

1286
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:22,880
- That was his.

1287
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:25,450
- Your aunt thought he was a fool.

1288
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,121
She was a skeptic like you.

1289
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,494
But interestingly enough,

1290
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:30,396
she couldn't bring herself
to tear it down

1291
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:31,763
even after he died.

1292
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,769
And then, in the last year of her life,

1293
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:38,933
she began to believe it herself,
said she felt it for the first time,

1294
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:42,603
felt that it was angry at her
for not leaving the house to you.

1295
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:44,203
- This has a history?

1296
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:46,077
- This has a history.

1297
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:47,878
- What else do you know?

1298
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:50,249
In the church,
you warned me about the house.

1299
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:51,719
You spoke of this evil presence.

1300
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:52,743
- What did you mean?

1301
01:09:55,391 --> 01:10:00,488
- Have you ever wondered why you
can't remember your mother, Bryan?

1302
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,963
- Because she died when I was five.

1303
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,431
- Five-year-olds have memories,

1304
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:07,697
unless they don't want to have memories,

1305
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:09,169
unless they're bad memories,

1306
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,730
unless they're memories
of being locked in a closet

1307
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:14,538
when they were terrified of darkness,

1308
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:18,673
of being hit so hard with a curtain rod
that the welts bled,

1309
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,579
of being half starved to death

1310
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:23,244
because they forgot to say grace
at the table.

1311
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:24,877
- You're wrong, Father.

1312
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,854
My mother was a good person.

1313
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:31,326
- You've made her a good person
in your own mind, son.

1314
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,329
She was a monstrous person.

1315
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,831
I knew her.

1316
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:39,993
And some monstrous part of her
is still in that house.

1317
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,662
I would've told you earlier,

1318
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:45,231
but everybody was so afraid
of telling you things

1319
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:46,536
that you didn't remember.

1320
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:55,975
- Tell me something, Father.

1321
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:58,009
These alleged abuses you talk of,

1322
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:00,783
did you witness them firsthand
for yourself?

1323
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:03,121
- No, they were relayed to me
by your Aunt Marlene.

1324
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:06,286
- Then it's hearsay,

1325
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:09,491
testimony of conduct
not directly observed.

1326
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:12,830
It's hearsay.

1327
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,531
- No, you know what's rude?

1328
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:22,771
A child having a liver lacerated

1329
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:24,870
by a doctor who's hopped up
on pain pills.

1330
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:25,902
That's what's rude.

1331
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,176
- That's not fair.

1332
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:28,274
- Kid comes under your care.

1333
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:29,648
You know this guy's history.

1334
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:33,712
Have a conversation about how he
appeared that morning.

1335
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:36,657
- No, Jennifer Burkhardt had
a conversation with Dr. March, not me.

1336
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:38,319
- I don't care who it was.

1337
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,622
You were aware that he...

1338
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:48,068
No, no!

1339
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:49,695
No, no!

1340
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,502
- You gonna object to any of this?

1341
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:04,243
- That's courthouse gossip.

1342
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:06,083
- It's not.

1343
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:08,180
- Hey, partner.

1344
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:09,622
How you doin', buddy?

1345
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:13,958
Listen, um, I was wonderin' if
we can have a moment alone.

1346
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:17,292
Hey.

1347
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,301
Riley said you're actin'
all funky in court.

1348
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,768
What the hell is goin' on
with you, huh?

1349
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:21,792
Huh?

1350
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:22,826
And don't say "nothin'."

1351
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:24,065
And don't say, "It's personal,"

1352
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:26,233
"We don't go there,"
'cause today we're gonna go there.

1353
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:27,572
- You want to go there today, Sully?

1354
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:28,803
Want me to open up?

1355
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:29,833
Tell you everything?

1356
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:31,607
- Yes, I do.

1357
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:33,581
- I've been havin' a little
trouble concentrating

1358
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:35,640
since I started having these
unsolicited flashbacks

1359
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,549
of being severely abused as a child,

1360
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:40,248
locked in a closet,
beaten with a curtain rod till I bled.

1361
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:42,018
- What?

1362
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:43,046
- And all this on no sleep.

1363
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:46,619
Shepard gave me some pills for it,
but they've proved to be totally worthless.

1364
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:49,153
Except when you mix 'em with scotch,
they tend to, you know,

1365
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,563
sort of enhance the scotch.

1366
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:51,725
But no.

1367
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:54,463
I can't concentrate on getting dressed,
much less a court case.

1368
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:56,471
And about the only thing keepin'
me goin' these days

1369
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:58,564
is a morbid curiosity

1370
01:12:58,607 --> 01:12:59,938
of where exactly it'll be

1371
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:01,772
that I totally fuckin' lose it.

1372
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:09,313
So how do you like
our new relationship so far,

1373
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:10,841
the opening up thing?

1374
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:15,454
- I like it better.

1375
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,423
- Well, bless your heart, partner.

1376
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,661
I think it rots.

1377
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:32,073
- Hey.
- Hey, Sully.

1378
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:33,096
What's happenin'?

1379
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:34,131
- Where is he?

1380
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:36,144
- He's in the back, man,
and he looks like shit.

1381
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:37,167
- Thank you.

1382
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:38,201
- Want a beer?

1383
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,306
- Yes.

1384
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:50,852
- I have an idea.

1385
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:53,088
Why don't we go back
to my office for a nightcap?

1386
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:54,117
- I have a better idea.

1387
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:55,994
Why don't you sit down
and spill all the shit

1388
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:57,760
you've been keeping from me
all these years,

1389
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,200
and I won't sue you
for medical malpractice.

1390
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:02,726
- All right.

1391
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:12,809
What have I been keeping?

1392
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:15,646
- That I lived there
and she abused me there.

1393
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:16,946
- True.

1394
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:19,419
- And you let me go back
when I didn't know.

1395
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:20,444
- You knew, Bryan.

1396
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:21,922
Some part of you knew.

1397
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:24,926
That's why you went back,
tried to heal yourself.

1398
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:29,420
- And you're certain of this problem
that needed healing, right?

1399
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:30,659
- How do you mean?

1400
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:32,929
- That I lost touch with reality
when she died,

1401
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,435
that I was so young and traumatized

1402
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,098
that I couldn't grasp
that she was really dead.

1403
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,334
So I blocked memories,
hallucinated her.

1404
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:40,363
- Yes.

1405
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:41,501
Something like that.

1406
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:45,240
- And what if I told you
that you are so blind with psychiatry

1407
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,180
that you have totally
missed the boat on this one?

1408
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,184
- Which is?

1409
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:52,517
- That I am truly being haunted.

1410
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:55,856
- You don't really believe that.

1411
01:14:55,891 --> 01:14:57,916
I am seeing things
in that house, Doctor,

1412
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,929
and hearing things all the time.

1413
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:03,488
You think I'm that crazy
all by myself?

1414
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:05,261
- Yes, I think you're quite ill.

1415
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,829
- You are wrong.

1416
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:11,169
There's something supernatural
going on in there.

1417
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:13,538
And I have all kinds of corroboration.

1418
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:15,133
- Well, let's have it, Oounselor.

1419
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:16,610
Let's try this thing.

1420
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:24,047
- My Uncle Ohester, to start with...

1421
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:26,145
- Your Uncle Ohester was a fool.

1422
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:27,883
He was superstitious, gullible.

1423
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:28,912
Did you know

1424
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:31,084
he reported so many
UFO sightings in the '50s,

1425
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:33,594
the police wouldn't take
his calls any more.

1426
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:36,029
- No, I didn't.

1427
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:38,294
But my aunt was no fool.

1428
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:39,561
And in the last year of her life...

1429
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:41,193
- The last year of her life,

1430
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:44,364
she was suffering
from progressive dementia

1431
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:47,466
due to advanced
cerebral atherosclerosis.

1432
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:49,568
I have people who will swear
that she was lucid...

1433
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:51,238
- She was lucid part of the time.

1434
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,474
That's how it works.

1435
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,042
Father Wymond at Saint...

1436
01:15:58,086 --> 01:15:59,280
- You're gonna quote me a priest?

1437
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:02,415
They think they're dealing
with the supernatural 9:00 to 5:00.

1438
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:04,755
You want to stake your sanity on that?

1439
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:14,691
- Do all kids who are abused
crack up so bad that they see things?

1440
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:15,930
Or am I just weak?

1441
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:17,632
- I don't think you're weak, Bryan.

1442
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:20,506
I think you're carrying more.

1443
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:22,271
- More.

1444
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:27,409
- What is the last memory you
have of your mother,

1445
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:29,440
not including her death?

1446
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,784
- My last memory.

1447
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:38,020
Hmm.

1448
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:40,255
She was cooking, I think,
in the kitchen.

1449
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:43,856
- What was she cooking for?

1450
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,161
- A picnic.

1451
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,258
We were going on a picnic.

1452
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:47,825
- Yes.

1453
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:51,464
And what happened with the picnic?

1454
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:52,905
- Well, I don't remember.

1455
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:54,932
We wound up not going
for one reason or another.

1456
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:57,810
- What was the reason?

1457
01:16:57,846 --> 01:16:58,835
- I don't know.

1458
01:16:58,880 --> 01:16:59,869
Maybe it rained.

1459
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:01,940
- No, it didn't rain, Bryan.

1460
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:03,451
It was a beautiful, sunny day.

1461
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:06,886
- Then why didn't we go?

1462
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:10,016
Because that morning,
when you cleaned your room,

1463
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:13,027
you left a sock on the floor.

1464
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:16,394
So instead of going on a picnic,

1465
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:20,458
you were locked in the closet
for the remainder of the day

1466
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:23,164
and half the next.

1467
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,004
- A red sock.

1468
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:34,913
- Yes.

1469
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:39,280
- I remember.

1470
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:42,779
Hmm.

1471
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,689
God, how sad is that?

1472
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:45,750
- Sad?

1473
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:47,853
It's infuriating, don't you think,

1474
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:50,922
to be locked in the closet for a sock?

1475
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:53,799
And you were angry, Bryan, very angry.

1476
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:57,271
You wanted to lash back.

1477
01:17:57,305 --> 01:18:03,972
So you left some toys
you were playing with

1478
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,843
on the stairs

1479
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:06,939
near the top.

1480
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:08,973
- What?
- Some toys.

1481
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,279
A toy truck

1482
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:14,414
and an antique doll
of your mother's.

1483
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:16,583
You were five years old.

1484
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:18,149
She had abused you for five years.

1485
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:21,685
No one knew about it, no one.

1486
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,190
- Mom, no!

1487
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:31,664
- Press up against my hand.
- What did I do?

1488
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:32,696
- Press up.
- What did I do?

1489
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:33,730
- Easy.

1490
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:34,764
- What did I do?

1491
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:42,216
- Any dizziness still?

1492
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,877
- No.

1493
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:46,217
I had to make a judgment call
in there, Bryan.

1494
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:47,687
You were in a form of crisis.

1495
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,122
- I'm glad you told me.

1496
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:50,317
- What are you gonna do right now?

1497
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:52,019
- I'm gonna go check into
the Gloucester,

1498
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,290
get my stuff
and get out of the house.

1499
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:56,354
- That's exactly what you should do.

1500
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:57,626
I'll call you later on.

1501
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:59,133
We'll set something up
for tomorrow.

1502
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:00,862
All right?

1503
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:02,494
- That's what was wrong with her face.

1504
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:03,731
- What's that?

1505
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:07,936
- That's what was wrong
with my mother's face.

1506
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:13,007
She was looking at me.

1507
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:12,263
This is Bryan Becket.

1508
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:13,638
Please leave a message.

1509
01:20:13,675 --> 01:20:14,664
Oassie, it's Bryan.

1510
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:17,974
Pick up.

1511
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:20,504
What the hell are you still doing in there?

1512
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:23,882
Didn't you tell me you had to leave?

1513
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:27,878
Oassie, pick up.

1514
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:30,016
Oassie.

1515
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:31,116
Oassie.

1516
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,133
Oassie?

1517
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:50,167
Oassie!

1518
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:55,739
Oassie?

1519
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:31,541
- Hello?

1520
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:32,575
- Oassie?

1521
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:33,610
- Bryan?

1522
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:34,917
- Oassie, where are you?

1523
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:36,048
Why'd you leave your car here?

1524
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:37,080
- I didn't.

1525
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:38,524
- What are you talking about?

1526
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,324
It's right out in the driveway.

1527
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:48,165
- Bryan?

1528
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:51,195
Bryan.

1529
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:06,577
- Very good, Mother.

1530
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:11,354
You got me back in.

1531
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:14,055
Why?

1532
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:18,259
Do you want to punish me again?

1533
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,597
Is that it?

1534
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,498
I'm not five anymore!

1535
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:29,004
Oome on!

1536
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:31,638
Oome on!

1537
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:37,184
You know what you can do, Mother?

1538
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:38,708
You can go straight to hell.
