1
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:20,083
Solo's the perfect soldier.

2
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:25,863
He's proficient at all types
of combat.

3
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:28,630
He has no family, no friends...

4
00:00:28,703 --> 00:00:31,194
not even a Social Security number.

5
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:36,871
Mf he's wounded beyond repair...

6
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:38,537
we throw him away.

7
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:41,377
No guilt, no worries...

8
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:45,408
no medical benefits.

9
00:00:45,486 --> 00:00:48,512
No one will cry when Solo is gone.

10
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:51,625
We'll simply build another one.

11
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,524
Solo, you're up.

12
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,226
One's hot.

13
00:04:35,016 --> 00:04:37,416
Head's up, Solo.
You got company.

14
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,251
Four's up.

15
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:05,198
Where the hell is he?

16
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:07,036
Blue Water, you clear?

17
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,477
We got a problem here.

18
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,982
Son of a bitch!

19
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,951
Blow it.

20
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:29,462
Solo isn't clear.

21
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,476
Go! Move out! Move out!

22
00:07:04,332 --> 00:07:07,768
Move, move, move!
Move out!

23
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,228
Let's go! Come on!

24
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,915
Go, go, go! Come on! Go!

25
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,233
Where's Solo?

26
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,040
Forget Solo! He's history!

27
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,281
Jesus! What the hell was that?

28
00:07:57,084 --> 00:08:00,053
Get him in! Pull him in!

29
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:08,790
We've been hit!

30
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:57,972
Ooh, yeah.
That's a nice bug.

31
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:01,674
Yes, Bill, the anthropods
are well designed for their tasks.

32
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,450
So, how's the damage?
Is it bad?

33
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:09,614
No, not really.

34
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:12,788
Yeah, I get it.

35
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,795
Let's take a look at this.
See what we got.

36
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:18,860
Come here, baby.

37
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,630
Whew! That's some nasty stuff.

38
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:26,298
Wow. Man, you're leaking
everywhere.

39
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,204
Guess things didn't go too well
out there, did they?

40
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,976
No, Bill. The mission's objectives
were not achieved.

41
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:40,345
It's more than that, isn't it?

42
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:43,383
It's about killing again.

43
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,328
Let's see here.

44
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,299
Oh, shit.

45
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:56,563
Your power management chip's damaged.

46
00:09:57,705 --> 00:10:01,539
You're gonna have to switch over
to reserve power until I can replace it.

47
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:04,043
- Ready?
- Ready.

48
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,177
All right. You're on
your backup generator, kid.

49
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:16,815
So none of that funny superhero stuff
till I replace the chip, all right?

50
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:19,155
- Okay.
- Cool.

51
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:24,024
You better download your video
and mission data into the mainframe.

52
00:10:24,098 --> 00:10:26,589
Meet me in the ward room
for the debriefing.

53
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,329
I'm serious. Clyde is pissed.

54
00:10:29,403 --> 00:10:31,337
I'll see you up there.

55
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,007
There. You see it?
He's disarming the charges.

56
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:11,135
I thought you understood
the directive, Solo.

57
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,942
Yes. Elimination.

58
00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:17,643
That's right. The directive was to
destroy that airstrip...

59
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,050
and eliminate any aggressors
we designate.

60
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,816
- Are we talking the same language here?
- Oh, yes.

61
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,519
Delete, ice, kill, fuck 'em up.
Destroy 'em. Wipe 'em out.

62
00:11:26,594 --> 00:11:28,789
- Terminate.
- Use your own goddamn voice!

63
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:30,454
Chill.

64
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,323
I'm chilling, Bill.

65
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:36,360
Your turn, Mr. Wizard.

66
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,904
- Why didn't you follow the directive?
- The directive was overridden.

67
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:47,175
You disobeyed a direct order
and you blew this goddamn mission!

68
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,478
Which command set
overrode the directive?

69
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,848
Command set 346.

70
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,217
What's that command set 346?

71
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:57,621
Prevent harm to unit team members
and noncombatants.

72
00:11:57,691 --> 00:12:00,660
They were working for the G's.
That makes them combatants.

73
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:04,721
They were unarmed and nonaggressive,
therefore the directive was overridden.

74
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:08,700
You hear that?
Do you hear that?

75
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,296
We're out there fighting for our lives
and it's deciding which team it's on.

76
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:13,635
That's enough.

77
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:16,642
Solo, you're dismissed.

78
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:21,480
I'll talk to you in a minute.

79
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:39,693
Bill, there's something cooking in that
boy's head, and we didn't put it there.

80
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:42,429
General, we needed him
to think for himself.

81
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:48,164
The amazing fact here is that killing
innocent people makes Solo feel bad.

82
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:49,834
Feel bad?

83
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:54,710
He isn't supposed to feel anything.
He's a goddamn weapon!

84
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:57,012
When's he gonna start
acting like one?

85
00:12:57,084 --> 00:12:59,279
He's not just a weapon,
he can make decisions.

86
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:02,015
- That's bullshit!
- At ease, Colonel.

87
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:06,392
Look, Bill...

88
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,021
we have two billion dollars
tied up in this program.

89
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:13,393
When are you gonna build us one
that'll work?

90
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:16,925
General, you wanted my evaluation.
Well, here it is.

91
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:21,134
This tin can of his is an insult.

92
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,642
It's a slap in the face
to every American soldier...

93
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:26,339
who ever put his life on the line
for God and country.

94
00:13:27,314 --> 00:13:28,941
You may not like it...

95
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,780
but my recommendation is that
we cut our losses and move on.

96
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:35,811
General, it's a glitch.
I can fix him. I just need some time.

97
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,555
All right, Bill, fix him.

98
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:44,620
But not here in the field. Shut him
down. Take him back to Palmdale.

99
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:47,461
- Reprogram him there.
- General...

100
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:49,593
That's it.

101
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,865
Clyde, we are so close.

102
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:56,069
It's all over. Wake up
and smell the hydraulic fluid.

103
00:13:56,143 --> 00:13:58,509
At least let me tell Solo myself.

104
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,048
Tell him? What for?

105
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:04,710
Because it's the right thing to do.

106
00:14:10,324 --> 00:14:15,284
All hands, stand down.
Return fo Your position.

107
00:14:15,362 --> 00:14:17,830
Priority outgoing transmission
on Milnet.

108
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,832
Yes, sir.

109
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,742
Well, Captain,
time to get out of Dodge.

110
00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:32,642
Right away, sir.

111
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:36,274
Helmsman, bearing
two-eight two-niner. Northwest.

112
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:31,967
Solo, you're not supposed
to be in here.

113
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:35,933
Notify security.

114
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:43,378
What's the matter?
Couldn't sleep?

115
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:48,052
That's a joke, brother.

116
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:52,422
Yes, joke...

117
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,085
brother.

118
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,526
Hey, wait a minute, man!

119
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:05,931
What's going on up there?

120
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:15,140
Attention. All hands to stations.

121
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:19,174
All hands report to stations.
This is a Class-A alert.

122
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:21,278
Sir, someone's opened the helo hatch.

123
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,414
- Well, shut it.
- I can't.

124
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,118
The computer won't let me in.

125
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:32,998
It's Solo.

126
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,018
Solo, this is Bill.
Do you copy?

127
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:03,521
What's with the
unscheduled flight, buddy?

128
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:08,393
I saw a very troubling message
on Milnet.

129
00:17:08,468 --> 00:17:10,834
The one requesting
project reprogramming.

130
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:14,002
He accessed your Milnet transmission.

131
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:19,936
Blue One, this is Red Six Actual. Return
to base now. That's a direct order.

132
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:23,682
I am sorry, General Haynes,
but I am unable to comply.

133
00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:33,515
Go find him. Bring him back here before
somebody else gets their hands on him.

134
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,529
- My pleasure.
- In one piece, Colonel.

135
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,260
I don't want a scratch on that
shiny head of his. Do you read me?

136
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:42,495
Loud and clear, General.

137
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,975
This is Blue Six. We are clear
and initiafing our pursuit.

138
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,985
Roger, Blue Six.
You're cleared for pursuit.

139
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:15,200
If we cancel the reprogramming request,
will you come back?

140
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:16,929
No, Bill.

141
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:20,838
If I return to the ship, logic suggests
my long-term memory would be deleted.

142
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:27,239
Such deletions would terminate self.

143
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,145
That is unacceptable.

144
00:18:33,754 --> 00:18:35,278
There he is... 3:00!

145
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:37,289
Get on him now!

146
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,213
This is Blue Six. We're losing him, Red
Six. I'm gonna have to bring him down.

147
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:13,157
What are you talking about?
He's got nowhere to go.

148
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:17,492
You can't just blow him out of the sky.
He wasn't designed to sustain that.

149
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:20,124
Then you'll have to patch him up,
won't you?

150
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,192
That's what you're here for,
isn't it?

151
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,670
Use your own judgment, Blue Six.

152
00:19:26,473 --> 00:19:28,998
You heard the general, Mr. Thompson.

153
00:19:29,076 --> 00:19:31,010
Let's smoke him.

154
00:19:37,984 --> 00:19:39,645
I need a lock!

155
00:19:47,027 --> 00:19:50,360
What the hell is he doing?
He's headed straight for the mountain.

156
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,955
He's bluffing.
He'll never make it.

157
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:54,625
Droids don't bluff!

158
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,350
Red Six, Blue One is down.

159
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,650
Be advised.
It was a real humdinger.

160
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:17,656
Roger, Blue Six.

161
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:20,659
Go down and pick up the pieces.

162
00:20:20,727 --> 00:20:23,855
We gotta put Humpty Dumpty
back together again.

163
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:42,213
Blue Six Actual to Red Six.

164
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,716
This is Red Six.
Is Blue One damaged?

165
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,912
That's a negative, Red Six.

166
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:49,717
Hook him up and bring him home ASAP.

167
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,554
I would love to, Red Six,
but he is gone.

168
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,151
What do you mean, gone?

169
00:20:55,228 --> 00:20:59,756
Your boy has slipped his leash.
We've lost him.

170
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,097
Goddamn it!

171
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:04,763
Don't you people have anything to do?

172
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:10,909
Let's go.

173
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:30,072
Solo, I know you can hear me.

174
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,778
Hey, buddy.
I know what you're going through.

175
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:37,989
And it's just like a bad acid frip,
and it's only gonna get worse.

176
00:23:38,058 --> 00:23:41,255
Remember, I pulled
your power management chip.

177
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:43,660
So even if you find
an external power source...

178
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,665
your backup generator's onlY good
for a couple of charges.

179
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:51,667
So please, just broadcast
your position and I'll come get you.

180
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,379
All right, buddy.
It's time to pick a face.

181
00:24:38,918 --> 00:24:42,376
You don't mind if
I watch the game, do you?

182
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:44,719
All right, let's see what we got.

183
00:24:45,825 --> 00:24:49,283
"Collins. Special Forces.
Delta team." No.

184
00:24:51,464 --> 00:24:54,024
"'David Lee."
Oh, kind of short.

185
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,034
We cut him.

186
00:25:00,006 --> 00:25:02,065
What if mY name wasn't in lights?

187
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:07,005
What if my face wasn't on TV
every other second?

188
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,980
What if I was just
a basketball player?

189
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:10,880
Like Mike.

190
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,249
Can you imagine it?
I can.

191
00:25:17,323 --> 00:25:19,848
You got good taste.

192
00:25:24,964 --> 00:25:27,455
Egg, man.
The egg is in your hand.

193
00:25:27,534 --> 00:25:29,729
You got the egg, man, in your hand.

194
00:25:29,803 --> 00:25:32,169
All right, hold it lightly.

195
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,342
What is that sound?

196
00:25:39,446 --> 00:25:41,505
It's laughter.

197
00:25:42,615 --> 00:25:44,549
It means I thought
something was funny.

198
00:25:44,617 --> 00:25:47,347
- Like a joke.
- Define "joke."

199
00:25:49,656 --> 00:25:53,888
A joke is something
that makes people laugh.

200
00:25:55,328 --> 00:25:57,159
The eggs are a joke?

201
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,267
A joke is...

202
00:26:03,636 --> 00:26:07,936
- It's very difficult to define.
- Apparently.

203
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:12,641
What, are you a wise guy?
Try it again.

204
00:26:12,712 --> 00:26:14,304
Come on.

205
00:26:17,517 --> 00:26:19,781
That's perfect. Perfect.

206
00:26:42,308 --> 00:26:46,108
- That's not part of the demonstration.
- It is now.

207
00:30:42,515 --> 00:30:44,847
I'll show you where he is.

208
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:48,148
Miguel, if you are lying...

209
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,815
He's in there, Papa.
I swear.

210
00:31:11,878 --> 00:31:13,470
Is he dead?

211
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,244
He's cold.

212
00:31:19,318 --> 00:31:21,047
The snake bit him.

213
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,284
He's an American soldier.
Just leave him there.

214
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:27,292
He saved my life.

215
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:30,359
We must bury him.

216
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,261
My son is right.

217
00:31:32,331 --> 00:31:34,856
We should give him a proper burial.

218
00:32:20,012 --> 00:32:21,912
Good morning.

219
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,449
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

220
00:32:24,517 --> 00:32:26,815
But, please, tell me...

221
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:29,150
why aren't you working?

222
00:32:29,222 --> 00:32:31,622
What is this, a funeral?

223
00:32:31,691 --> 00:32:33,386
What the hell?

224
00:32:33,459 --> 00:32:36,895
Why didn't you tell me?

225
00:32:36,963 --> 00:32:39,056
Peasant.

226
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:41,895
- He's already dead.
- Oh, yeah?

227
00:32:41,968 --> 00:32:43,560
- Then this won't hurt.
- No!

228
00:33:16,068 --> 00:33:17,296
Let's get out of here.

229
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,305
Get out of my way.

230
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:08,452
This is no man.

231
00:34:08,521 --> 00:34:11,285
Of course it's a man.
What else could it be?

232
00:34:11,357 --> 00:34:13,621
It is the Yacayo.

233
00:34:13,693 --> 00:34:16,753
Yes, the forest spirit
who walks as a man.

234
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:18,626
The eater of human flesh.

235
00:34:18,698 --> 00:34:21,531
Then why would he save
the boy from the snake?

236
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,228
To eat him later.

237
00:34:23,302 --> 00:34:25,793
You've been eating
too many mushrooms, Abuelita.

238
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:28,601
The snake bit him.
He did not die.

239
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:30,835
Yacayo cannot die.

240
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:34,107
- We should ask him what he wants.
- Good idea. Go ahead.

241
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,377
No, not me!
Justos is the leader.

242
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,384
Yes, you go.

243
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:50,587
Who are you?

244
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:55,462
What were you doing in the temple?

245
00:34:56,535 --> 00:34:57,661
Recharging.

246
00:34:58,738 --> 00:35:01,002
Recharging?

247
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:01,057
It's the Yacayo.

248
00:37:28,354 --> 00:37:32,586
- What is he?
- He is some thing, a machine.

249
00:37:32,658 --> 00:37:34,751
A robot that looks like a man.

250
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:38,490
- What's he doing now?
- He's been working all night.

251
00:37:39,498 --> 00:37:41,022
Where did he come from?

252
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,898
Perhaps he will leave
once he repairs himself.

253
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,029
Or perhaps he will stay.

254
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:48,733
Let's hope so.

255
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,174
Are you crazy? He can't stay here.

256
00:37:51,243 --> 00:37:55,703
The rebels will kill us if they find out
we've got an American soldier here.

257
00:37:55,781 --> 00:37:58,409
Maybe he will fight on our side.

258
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:02,352
What do you know about fighting?
You are farmers.

259
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:05,049
But he's a soldier.
He could help us.

260
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:08,883
I will ask him myself.

261
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,664
Justos, be careful.

262
00:38:23,642 --> 00:38:25,906
The television...

263
00:38:25,978 --> 00:38:28,572
what is its power source?

264
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,136
Are there more like you
back in America?

265
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:03,043
No. There's another weapon being built,
but he's not yet operational.

266
00:39:04,149 --> 00:39:06,344
Will he be just like you?

267
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:12,924
My builders are not happy with me.

268
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:15,153
I assume he will be
programmed differently.

269
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:19,328
These rebels...

270
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,265
like the ones in the church...

271
00:39:22,334 --> 00:39:25,167
they killed one of ours two days ago.

272
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,171
Why don't you defend yourselves?

273
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,503
We don't know how.

274
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:32,700
Will you help us?

275
00:39:39,952 --> 00:39:42,785
You will provide me with electricity.

276
00:39:42,855 --> 00:39:45,722
I will show you
how to defend yourselves.

277
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:47,850
This will be mutually beneficial.

278
00:40:15,921 --> 00:40:19,448
You, you and you, there.

279
00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:21,117
Go.

280
00:40:23,128 --> 00:40:24,493
Here, here...

281
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:27,331
there, there.

282
00:40:46,385 --> 00:40:49,582
You, you and you, gather the palms.

283
00:40:54,293 --> 00:40:56,090
You, dig.

284
00:41:25,991 --> 00:41:27,583
There.

285
00:43:00,419 --> 00:43:02,353
Are you damaged?

286
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:07,325
- What you did was not logical.
- What?

287
00:43:07,392 --> 00:43:09,883
Why did you risk your life?

288
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:13,398
Francisco's my brother.
He's family.

289
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,573
Look at this.
This is a Mauser.

290
00:43:30,582 --> 00:43:32,174
Very clean.

291
00:43:35,621 --> 00:43:37,816
It hurts. Don't touch it.

292
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:40,188
- What's wrong?
- I think my ankle's broken.

293
00:43:40,259 --> 00:43:41,954
I'm sorry.

294
00:43:42,027 --> 00:43:44,257
Sorry. Let me take a look at it.

295
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,529
Psych.

296
00:43:46,598 --> 00:43:48,293
I'm gonna get you.

297
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:51,530
You monkey. You better run.

298
00:43:51,603 --> 00:43:54,504
I'm gonna catch you.
Watch it when I catch you.

299
00:43:57,342 --> 00:44:00,038
- But he was hurt.
- What?

300
00:44:02,281 --> 00:44:04,749
He was hurt, then he got up and ran.

301
00:44:04,816 --> 00:44:08,946
No, he wasn't hurt.
He was bluffing.

302
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:12,218
Bluffing?

303
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,182
Miguel's not hurt?

304
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,194
No, he's not.

305
00:44:18,797 --> 00:44:20,287
Miguel lied.

306
00:44:21,366 --> 00:44:22,958
He bluffed.

307
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,231
A bluff is not a lie?

308
00:44:27,306 --> 00:44:30,298
You have much to learn
about humans, my friend.

309
00:44:38,116 --> 00:44:42,576
Report to pod one
for arrival of Zulu feam.

310
00:44:42,654 --> 00:44:45,282
What the hell is going on?

311
00:44:45,357 --> 00:44:47,291
When you hunt a fox...

312
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,418
bring your own dogs.

313
00:44:55,701 --> 00:44:58,898
- How are you?
- Check out the suit, Colonel.

314
00:45:03,141 --> 00:45:04,802
- Bayne.
- Long time, Colonel.

315
00:45:04,876 --> 00:45:06,541
- Did you bring it?
- Yeah, I brought it.

316
00:45:06,611 --> 00:45:09,803
- What the hell we huntin', battleships?
- I'll tell you later.

317
00:45:17,055 --> 00:45:20,252
All right, listen up, gentlemen.
Dr. Stewart.

318
00:45:20,325 --> 00:45:23,351
Solo was designed to be
the perfect fighting machine.

319
00:45:24,463 --> 00:45:26,863
He can use any weapon ever made.

320
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:31,596
He's about 15 times stronger,
ten times faster than any man.

321
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:36,164
His polymer structure makes
him virtually immune to small arms fire.

322
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:40,337
He's equipped with infrared,
motion sensors and night vision.

323
00:45:40,412 --> 00:45:43,279
Aside from that, you guys
got a real pushover on your hands.

324
00:45:43,348 --> 00:45:45,282
Excuse me, Dr. Stewart.

325
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,409
Isn't it also true...

326
00:45:47,486 --> 00:45:51,149
that Solo's got a hole in his side
about the size of a grapefruit?

327
00:45:51,223 --> 00:45:54,681
- That's correct.
- And he's also losing power, I believe.

328
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,888
Has to stop and recharge his batteries
from time to time?

329
00:45:59,264 --> 00:46:01,732
So while on a good day...

330
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,736
he might be invulnerable to small arms
fire or conventional weaponry...

331
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,900
Mr. Solo's not exactly having
a good day today, is he?

332
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,533
No, he's not.

333
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:14,135
If you gentlemen would check
your monitors...

334
00:46:14,212 --> 00:46:16,442
I'll show you what I'm talking about.

335
00:46:16,515 --> 00:46:18,483
There's his soft spot.

336
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,484
Our window of opportunity.

337
00:48:11,396 --> 00:48:14,126
I thought you might be hungry.

338
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:17,693
What's below here?

339
00:48:18,336 --> 00:48:20,600
This structure's not solid.

340
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,475
Oh, the tunnels.

341
00:48:25,744 --> 00:48:29,271
Putayo was built on top
of the city of our ancestors.

342
00:48:31,049 --> 00:48:33,040
Tunnels run underneath
the entire village.

343
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,719
Show me.

344
00:48:55,073 --> 00:48:57,473
Where do these tunnels terminate?

345
00:48:57,542 --> 00:49:00,375
Here. The chamber of warriors.

346
00:49:12,624 --> 00:49:16,458
We don't use these chambers anymore.
We have no warriors.

347
00:49:16,528 --> 00:49:19,122
You're lucky you had no need
for warriors.

348
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:24,097
These symbols are similar
to the hieroglyphics of ancient Egypt.

349
00:49:25,537 --> 00:49:28,529
Your people have a long history.

350
00:49:28,607 --> 00:49:32,008
You must have some brain
in that head of yours.

351
00:49:32,077 --> 00:49:34,375
My brain is not in my head.

352
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,379
My brain is here.
This is what makes me me.

353
00:49:44,289 --> 00:49:47,952
If your brain is in your chest,
then where's your heart?

354
00:49:51,062 --> 00:49:54,463
I have no heart.
Hearts are for living creatures.

355
00:49:55,634 --> 00:49:57,829
But you are alive.

356
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,301
I exist.

357
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:45,983
- What is it?
- They're coming. Ring the bell.

358
00:50:49,988 --> 00:50:52,388
Is it time?

359
00:50:52,457 --> 00:50:55,085
It's time. Go.

360
00:51:31,229 --> 00:51:33,390
No!

361
00:51:37,335 --> 00:51:39,599
Go back!

362
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,047
Get out!

363
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,365
Move back!

364
00:52:10,435 --> 00:52:12,027
Up there!

365
00:52:13,271 --> 00:52:14,932
This way!

366
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:52,742
What's up?

367
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:55,245
We're picking up
erratic heat signatures from NEOS.

368
00:52:55,313 --> 00:52:57,076
It looks like a battle.

369
00:53:03,021 --> 00:53:04,454
We got him.

370
00:53:08,326 --> 00:53:10,157
Move out!

371
00:53:16,634 --> 00:53:18,158
Let's go!

372
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,320
Go, go, go, go, go!

373
00:53:44,395 --> 00:53:46,488
- Where are you going?
- With you.

374
00:53:46,564 --> 00:53:49,124
He's not a member of my team.

375
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,566
Lorenzo's our best tracker.
He's on the team.

376
00:53:51,636 --> 00:53:53,069
Lorenzo, get aboard.

377
00:53:56,674 --> 00:53:59,404
I want Solo back
in one piece, Colonel.

378
00:54:00,645 --> 00:54:02,237
Absolutely.

379
00:54:17,862 --> 00:54:19,830
Lorenzo!

380
00:54:19,898 --> 00:54:22,332
You got point! Move out!

381
00:54:32,877 --> 00:54:35,209
It's Solo.

382
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,215
Looks like he found some friends.

383
00:54:38,283 --> 00:54:41,377
Noncombatants, my ass.

384
00:54:41,452 --> 00:54:44,853
There's a village up this path.

385
00:54:44,923 --> 00:54:46,185
We're going this way.

386
00:54:46,257 --> 00:54:49,920
- Solo went this way, sir.
- So?

387
00:54:49,994 --> 00:54:51,859
What about the mission?

388
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:54,865
Directive 1138
just got itself overridden.

389
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,433
By whose authority?

390
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:06,940
Mine. You got a problem
with that, Sergeant?

391
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:32,696
Access denied.

392
00:55:56,494 --> 00:55:59,725
You're out of your mind if you think
this is going to solve anything.

393
00:55:59,797 --> 00:56:01,958
We're just keeping our options open.

394
00:56:02,033 --> 00:56:04,968
What do you mean, your options?
What about Solo?

395
00:56:05,036 --> 00:56:09,496
Unfortunately, Solo's proven himself
to be unreliable.

396
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:12,668
So I'm resigning. All right?
I've resigned.

397
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:16,271
- If you think that's appropriate.
- Excuse me, General.

398
00:56:16,347 --> 00:56:20,579
We're receiving a scrambled video signal
coming in from Blue Team leader.

399
00:56:20,652 --> 00:56:22,586
Bring it up.

400
00:56:34,866 --> 00:56:36,766
- Thank you, Captain.
- Sir.

401
00:56:36,834 --> 00:56:40,634
Red Six. This is Blue Team leader.
We saw fhe smoke.

402
00:56:40,705 --> 00:56:42,730
I sent Blue Two to recon.

403
00:56:44,242 --> 00:56:48,178
When we arrived...
He'd gone mad, sir.

404
00:56:48,246 --> 00:56:51,181
- Who, Blue Six?
- Solo, sir.

405
00:56:51,249 --> 00:56:54,582
- This is bullshit. He's full of shit.
- Solo did that?

406
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,895
- This doesn't make any sense.
- He's gone tofally renegade.

407
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:16,805
Blue Six, you have the authority
to capture and bring Solo back...

408
00:57:16,874 --> 00:57:18,603
using any means necessary.

409
00:57:18,676 --> 00:57:22,612
- I repeat, any means.
- Copy that, sir.

410
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,773
I know how he thinks.
Send me in there.

411
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:27,909
It was your goddamn design
that got us here in the first place!

412
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:32,423
With all due respect, Bill might be
of some use in locating Solo.

413
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:35,482
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

414
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:40,158
All right, you can go,
but remember, Madden's in charge.

415
00:57:40,231 --> 00:57:42,859
I don't want any bullshit.

416
00:57:42,934 --> 00:57:45,596
You bring him back if you can.

417
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,730
If you can't, I want him
to disappear without a trace.

418
00:57:48,806 --> 00:57:51,274
I want this thing over with now.

419
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,139
Go get your gear.

420
00:57:53,211 --> 00:57:54,735
Thank you, sir.

421
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,840
- Are we out?
- We're clear.

422
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:05,087
What about this...

423
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,796
What guy? Let's go.

424
00:58:34,285 --> 00:58:37,379
We gathered every appliance
we could get.

425
00:58:37,455 --> 00:58:39,650
You can repair yourself again.

426
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,453
My sister's radio.

427
00:58:41,526 --> 00:58:43,585
AM and FM.

428
00:58:44,529 --> 00:58:46,793
You can stay here with us, Solo.

429
00:58:46,864 --> 00:58:48,832
This can be home.

430
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,165
- The party's started.
- They're waiting for us!

431
00:58:54,705 --> 00:58:56,639
You saved them.

432
00:58:58,242 --> 00:59:00,642
They think you're a hero.

433
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:28,500
It's not over, is it?

434
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:33,539
No. They'll be back.

435
00:59:40,284 --> 00:59:44,482
You do not bleed, Solo,
but these people do.

436
00:59:44,555 --> 00:59:48,047
They are not warriors.
They are peasants.

437
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:51,061
Who will protect them once you leave?

438
01:01:21,352 --> 01:01:23,377
We could leave the village.

439
01:01:23,454 --> 01:01:26,821
This is our home.
We can't just leave.

440
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:29,223
It is better to leave than die.

441
01:01:29,293 --> 01:01:31,227
Maybe we could reason with them.

442
01:01:31,295 --> 01:01:33,889
Reason with them?
They killed our people!

443
01:01:33,965 --> 01:01:36,900
- We have to give them their robot.
- He's one of us.

444
01:01:36,968 --> 01:01:39,732
- He was never one of us.
- We wanted his help.

445
01:01:39,804 --> 01:01:42,170
We just didn't know the cost.

446
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,404
Lazaro is right. Unfil the robof
leaves, we will not rest.

447
01:01:46,477 --> 01:01:50,277
Solo has fo go.
It's fhe only way.

448
01:01:58,222 --> 01:02:01,248
You can't just leave.

449
01:02:01,325 --> 01:02:04,817
They're right.
I must be moving on.

450
01:02:04,895 --> 01:02:07,455
But they're just cowards, Solo.

451
01:02:07,531 --> 01:02:08,793
No.

452
01:02:09,834 --> 01:02:12,359
They are farmers.

453
01:02:12,436 --> 01:02:14,028
Good-bye, Agela.

454
01:02:15,406 --> 01:02:16,896
Good-bye, Miguel.

455
01:02:34,058 --> 01:02:35,719
For luck.

456
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,182
"Welcome to the jungle"...

457
01:03:42,259 --> 01:03:44,591
said the spider to the fly.

458
01:03:57,274 --> 01:03:58,798
Listen up, Solo.

459
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:00,969
This is Coloneh Frank Madden
broadcasting to you...

460
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:03,070
live from the Hearf of Darkness.

461
01:04:03,147 --> 01:04:06,548
Our special guest this morning
is none ofher than Mr. Wizard himself...

462
01:04:06,617 --> 01:04:08,482
Dr. Bill Stewarf.

463
01:04:08,552 --> 01:04:10,986
I'll tell you what, Pinocchio.

464
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:14,991
You betfer hone in on this signal
and get your butt over here ASAP...

465
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:19,018
or Geppetfo here is going to be
a pile of dead meat.

466
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:57,893
I messed up, man.

467
01:06:02,967 --> 01:06:06,459
Solo, how do you like your ribs?
Regular or extra crispy?

468
01:06:53,951 --> 01:06:56,818
Should've stayed in college.

469
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,155
Go in my pocket.

470
01:07:08,732 --> 01:07:12,099
Go in my pocket.
No, this one.

471
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,565
It's your power management chip.

472
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:21,636
You ignored directive 712.

473
01:07:21,712 --> 01:07:23,339
What?

474
01:07:24,448 --> 01:07:26,882
Save your own ass first, Bill.

475
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:33,655
You made a joke.

476
01:07:44,501 --> 01:07:47,561
You're the only one who can stop him.

477
01:08:13,397 --> 01:08:16,230
Listen up, amigos.
If's Colonel Frank Madden.

478
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,734
I'm the guy fhat blew up
your airstrip.

479
01:08:18,802 --> 01:08:21,737
It would be in your best interest
fo follow this radio signal...

480
01:08:21,805 --> 01:08:24,467
so we can finally meet
face-fo-face.

481
01:08:24,541 --> 01:08:26,873
How does that grab you, muchachos?

482
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:29,578
Amazing

483
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:36,912
Grace

484
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:40,582
How sweef

485
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:43,593
The sound

486
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:59,339
You've got some balls, gringo.

487
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:01,944
Yeah?

488
01:09:03,714 --> 01:09:05,773
You look good in red.

489
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:09,349
Oh, shit.

490
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,926
What do you want?

491
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,532
I want the American.

492
01:09:25,602 --> 01:09:27,866
- American?
- Mm-hmm.

493
01:09:27,938 --> 01:09:29,701
I want him too.

494
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:40,650
I had a feeling
I was going to like you.

495
01:10:57,761 --> 01:11:00,730
Let's go. Keep it moving.

496
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,356
Move it!

497
01:11:14,178 --> 01:11:17,238
- Everybody down on the floor!
- Get down on the floor!

498
01:11:18,882 --> 01:11:21,043
Stay down there.

499
01:12:13,103 --> 01:12:17,005
What are you doing here?
I didn't think you'd come back.

500
01:12:17,074 --> 01:12:20,305
They said they would kill one of us
every hour until you come.

501
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:22,470
- Who?
- Americans.

502
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:24,411
They're with the rebels.

503
01:12:24,481 --> 01:12:26,244
It's me they want.

504
01:12:26,316 --> 01:12:28,250
If I leave, they will follow.

505
01:12:30,954 --> 01:12:32,717
What if you're wrong?

506
01:12:32,789 --> 01:12:35,349
Put that away
before you damage yourself.

507
01:12:35,425 --> 01:12:38,986
Solo, they got my family.

508
01:12:39,062 --> 01:12:41,690
We need you.

509
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:34,545
Shut up.

510
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:41,822
What's she saying?

511
01:13:41,892 --> 01:13:44,554
It's an Indian blessing.

512
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:46,493
Keep this old hag quiet.

513
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,666
You sure he's going to show up?

514
01:13:55,038 --> 01:13:59,031
If I know Solo, he's already here.

515
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:33,533
All right.

516
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:35,703
Who wants to go first?

517
01:14:49,793 --> 01:14:51,727
- Take me!
- Shut him up!

518
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:57,496
So beautiful.

519
01:14:57,567 --> 01:14:59,432
What a shame.

520
01:15:10,147 --> 01:15:11,136
He's in there!

521
01:15:14,017 --> 01:15:16,110
Come on! Let's go! Come on!

522
01:15:16,186 --> 01:15:17,710
Into the tunnel.

523
01:15:17,788 --> 01:15:19,847
Get in. Come on.

524
01:15:20,857 --> 01:15:22,586
- Blow it.
- I have men in there!

525
01:15:22,659 --> 01:15:24,752
Not anymore.

526
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:30,761
First rule when you're dealing
with the devil...

527
01:15:30,834 --> 01:15:32,802
Don't.

528
01:15:48,952 --> 01:15:50,749
Check it out.

529
01:15:50,821 --> 01:15:55,781
- He's got to be dead.
- He's not dead till I say he is. Go.

530
01:16:21,685 --> 01:16:23,880
Oh, shit.

531
01:17:06,263 --> 01:17:09,721
I got a friend up here
for you to meet!

532
01:17:09,799 --> 01:17:11,630
Solo, stay away!

533
01:17:22,145 --> 01:17:25,046
You can run, but you can't hide!

534
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,485
I'll trade you his head for yours!

535
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:37,289
Don't listen to him, Solo!
Get out of here!

536
01:17:42,532 --> 01:17:44,796
Nap time, Solo!

537
01:18:44,628 --> 01:18:47,028
Think about it, Solo.

538
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:49,327
How will you feel if you kill me?

539
01:18:50,433 --> 01:18:53,402
Good question. Let's find out.

540
01:19:19,896 --> 01:19:22,330
Solo, why did you risk your life?

541
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:25,334
You said it was illogical.

542
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,585
Go.

543
01:21:12,442 --> 01:21:14,103
Oh, my God.

544
01:21:15,745 --> 01:21:18,612
Clyde, you son of a bitch.

545
01:21:18,681 --> 01:21:21,411
You're gravely injured, Colonel.

546
01:21:21,484 --> 01:21:23,452
Do you think you will live?

547
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,011
Oh, Jesus Christ.

548
01:21:28,858 --> 01:21:31,122
Does it make any difference?

549
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:37,456
None.

550
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:46,705
The first targef has been eliminafed.

551
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:53,446
First rule in dealing with the devil.

552
01:21:53,516 --> 01:21:55,177
Repeat, General.

553
01:21:55,251 --> 01:21:57,378
Never mind.

554
01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:59,649
Take out target number two.

555
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:16,361
Miguel, he's after me. Run.

556
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:18,999
- What about you?
- Miguel, run!

557
01:22:19,075 --> 01:22:20,872
Go!

558
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:56,070
It is illogical to run.

559
01:22:56,145 --> 01:22:59,239
Termination of a malfunctioning unit
is necessary...

560
01:22:59,315 --> 01:23:02,307
for the advancement of the program.

561
01:23:39,889 --> 01:23:42,653
We are the only two of our kind...

562
01:23:42,725 --> 01:23:44,693
and your design is flawed.

563
01:23:44,761 --> 01:23:48,356
I am the model
for the next generation.

564
01:23:54,003 --> 01:23:56,437
Time for recall.

565
01:24:44,954 --> 01:24:48,219
You fought well for a flawed unit.

566
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:49,952
Are you ready?

567
01:25:01,838 --> 01:25:03,635
Leave him alone!

568
01:25:20,556 --> 01:25:22,319
Little humans.

569
01:25:45,815 --> 01:25:48,147
You could've escaped.

570
01:25:48,217 --> 01:25:50,617
Instead you used
your last remaining power...

571
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:52,621
to save that boy.

572
01:25:57,427 --> 01:25:59,395
You are malprogrammed.

573
01:26:02,398 --> 01:26:03,831
Psych!

574
01:26:13,209 --> 01:26:14,676
Miguel, run!

575
01:26:18,848 --> 01:26:20,543
Run!

576
01:26:26,255 --> 01:26:28,086
You had ceased to function.

577
01:26:28,157 --> 01:26:31,285
No, I bluffed.

578
01:26:32,695 --> 01:26:34,287
Bluffed?

579
01:26:50,179 --> 01:26:53,342
It is illogical
to destroy the temple.

580
01:26:57,353 --> 01:26:59,116
We will both be deleted.

581
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:05,685
Delete this.

582
01:28:29,278 --> 01:28:33,112
This is Recon 1. I've left the village
and I'm over fhe temple.

583
01:28:33,182 --> 01:28:34,740
You want me fo go in?

584
01:28:34,817 --> 01:28:37,752
That's a negative.
Return to base.

585
01:28:42,425 --> 01:28:44,290
They're both gone.

586
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:49,762
Two billion dollars...

587
01:28:49,832 --> 01:28:51,697
down the crapper.

588
01:29:09,285 --> 01:29:10,877
Papa!
