1
00:01:44,500 --> 00:02:35,179
If. thank you very much.

2
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,464
What do you say?

3
00:02:37,465 --> 00:02:40,517
I want you to fuck me...

4
00:02:40,518 --> 00:02:53,961
Harder.

5
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:56,811
God, I beg you!

6
00:02:56,812 --> 00:03:31,426
A simple thank you is more
than acceptable.

7
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:33,882
I do not know how or why these

8
00:03:33,883 --> 00:03:38,468
Things happen, but they do.

9
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:39,987
And to be frank with you,

10
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:42,255
They have very few options.

11
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,340
Unfortunately, this is one of the moments

12
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:50,494
where medicine is not
very advanced

13
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:52,246
As I'm not your first visit

14
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:54,699
that my duty as a professional

15
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,283
is about surgery advise

16
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:59,718
But you probably also know that

17
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:07,945
is unlikely to lengthen its life.

18
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:19,854
Sorry.

19
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:35,350
A PERFECT ENDING

20
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:38,305
Mason is really too much to ask
call your secretary

21
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:41,408
to tell me he'd stopped for lunch?

22
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:43,243
Sorry, Beck.

23
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:47,697
You said I had to be there to
sign papers

24
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:49,764
You know who is playing with Susie Clyde

25
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:51,448
Listen.

26
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,317
Do you know why her husband married her?

27
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:55,586
his father owns half of Korea.

28
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,438
and his father is my fucking balls
on a silver platter in China

29
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,906
Order.

30
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:04,627
First of all, you're talking about two countries
completely different

31
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:07,966
Second, you know I can not stand,
you talk like people

32
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,466
Oh yeah?

33
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:11,418
I asked you to come here to
to sign some

34
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:13,386
to sign some stocks
and put in your name

35
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:16,005
to get out of this damn audit

36
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:18,523
What kind of problems you walk into?

37
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:21,642
We'll have to do a little
dear creative accounting

38
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:23,695
And you have to help.

39
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:25,830
So, I signed the papers and...

40
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:27,665
I do not know if I'll be home
for dinner

41
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:33,302
It is important to have dinner
with the family

42
00:05:33,303 --> 00:06:13,490
Sure as hell.

43
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:17,710
I've been with lots of girls.

44
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,060
I do not know because it is

45
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:24,449
better with you

46
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:48,755
Same time next week

47
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:50,773
Jeans and sneakers.

48
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:51,790
Thank you very much, Hank.

49
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,208
It's a little bitter to lose

50
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:57,078
Grows.

51
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,261
Loser.

52
00:06:58,262 --> 00:06:59,212
Grows.

53
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:01,364
Sore loser.

54
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:02,631
I said I would be late

55
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:03,816
You play tennis.

56
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:05,000
You can stop behaving like children

57
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:06,100
We have homework to do.

58
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:08,337
I had to return the money
I lost last night

59
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:11,256
Oh, look at you.

60
00:07:11,257 --> 00:07:16,413
I said, no more weekends Vegas

61
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:17,931
How much?

62
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:20,449
Would it help if I told you that I fully
love?

63
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,985
I always say that the money can not be
buying love.

64
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:27,437
Well, except for Ace.
Here

65
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:28,790
Janice leaves out of this.

66
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,457
I think you should get this Janice

67
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,776
But then what kind of partner would you do?

68
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:34,043
For, Hank.

69
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:35,329
Marissa.

70
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,879
If?

71
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,864
Have you seen my book?

72
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:41,032
No, I think I saw this morning
Mr. Mason's office

73
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,167
Do you want me to look?

74
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:43,083
Oh, would you, please?

75
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:44,104
Insurance.

76
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:45,355
Aaron!

77
00:07:45,356 --> 00:07:48,374
Aaron!

78
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:52,161
Do you plan to be late for this important event,
as our commitment?

79
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:57,616
Fiesta that my mother has planned for
the last six months?

80
00:07:57,617 --> 00:07:58,832
You will make very happy

81
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,669
You know, Mom, the way all the money
slipped through my fingers

82
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:10,059
wondering if she still loves me,
then she is the only

83
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,544
No jeans. Go and change.

84
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:13,544
Here you go, dear.

85
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:16,849
Oh, thank you very much

86
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:17,951
Need some help here?

87
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:19,035
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

88
00:08:19,036 --> 00:08:20,220
I have it. I have it.

89
00:08:20,221 --> 00:08:21,437
Thanks, Jess.

90
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:22,622
You look beautiful.

91
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:24,172
Thank you.

92
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:29,243
Oh, my god.
It's so late!

93
00:08:29,244 --> 00:08:41,653
Do not forget to breathe!

94
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:45,156
One of the girls Valentina

95
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,860
What I'm saying is that trying to
convince

96
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,094
For a
nipple ring

97
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,846
It will make everything a little
more exciting.

98
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:52,182
What is it about?

99
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:53,549
Nipple clamps.

100
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,835
She's just... fantastic.

101
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:57,887
I'm so out of place here.

102
00:08:57,888 --> 00:09:07,226
Do not worry.

103
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:12,031
I need a drink.

104
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:13,031
Oh, my god

105
00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:17,821
She's just... fantastic

106
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:24,627
She put a double butterfly
between us

107
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:26,228
Butterfly?

108
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:27,612
Oh, it's a vibrator.

109
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:28,963
She is amazing, right?

110
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:30,514
I've been three times.

111
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:32,917
Then she went down

112
00:09:32,918 --> 00:09:34,451
since the ceiling.

113
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:37,371
No, I'm not kidding.

114
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:39,839
Then you have the roof painted

115
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,777
Yeah, yeah.

116
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:49,583
Well, we have heard many stories tonight

117
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:51,467
and I want to hear your story.

118
00:09:51,468 --> 00:09:52,702
History?

119
00:09:52,703 --> 00:09:53,987
If.

120
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:56,606
Believe me, I have no story.

121
00:09:56,607 --> 00:10:00,859
Well, you have to have a story

122
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,060
I mean... What's your pleasure?
What do you like

123
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:08,314
you warm? what's your fantasy

124
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:10,182
You do not have to answer that?

125
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:13,402
No, I'm married.

126
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:15,788
Oh, Becks.

127
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:16,804
No
She is playing with me?

128
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:19,390
What's this?

129
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:23,363
Just...

130
00:10:23,364 --> 00:10:26,565
Can not resist?

131
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:28,384
You obviously are playing.

132
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:31,885
It's late, and I would like to take
night

133
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:35,673
Well, ladies. This is all

134
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:37,692
Oh, I like your pants.

135
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:42,411
Oh, thank you.

136
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:45,580
Ooh, ooh, girl.
It is very subtle

137
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:52,222
As a double or triple bypass
heart?

138
00:10:52,223 --> 00:10:53,307
Well, I liked it.

139
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:55,057
Uh, I know, in his work,
time is money

140
00:10:55,058 --> 00:11:02,247
But I would make up for
certain times

141
00:11:02,248 --> 00:11:24,351
No problem.

142
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:25,835
What is it?

143
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:33,708
I see it when they look, they eat with
their eyes even they, I mean it feels

144
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:37,377
Oh, god could feel it up in New Jersey
Right?

145
00:11:37,378 --> 00:11:43,883
The truth is that only luck...
but working on it

146
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:44,967
No?

147
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:47,185
We keep it exciting.

148
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:57,347
Work is needed by
the other part

149
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:58,632
Okay, um...

150
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:09,289
I'll tell you something I never
I told anyone.

151
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,843
You know everything about me right?

152
00:12:13,844 --> 00:12:17,729
Right.

153
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:23,285
I never, never...

154
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:27,757
Baby, we know that you are
not well you and the asshole

155
00:12:27,758 --> 00:12:30,810
Not that.

156
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:32,761
What?

157
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:34,246
Oh, for the love of God.

158
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:37,531
Come on, spill.

159
00:12:37,532 --> 00:12:39,583
I

160
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:42,603
I have never...

161
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:57,300
You never come?

162
00:12:57,301 --> 00:14:05,810
Exactly.

163
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,896
Mason?

164
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:09,780
He is a man man.

165
00:14:09,781 --> 00:14:13,434
We just do it twice a year.

166
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,785
We're both so good.

167
00:14:15,786 --> 00:14:16,920
OH, Becks!

168
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:19,154
Oh, well, you should have to masturbate

169
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:20,839
Do not say that word.

170
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,793
What "masturbate"?

171
00:14:24,794 --> 00:14:27,378
I have seen many doctors,

172
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:30,401
many therapists.

173
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,552
Something is wrong with me.

174
00:14:32,553 --> 00:14:34,803
What's going on, Rebecca?

175
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:39,707
Never had a moment of
passion in my life.

176
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,324
Damn it.

177
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:44,578
Is it so bad that I want...

178
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,763
Come to dinner tonight...

179
00:14:46,764 --> 00:14:49,815
find a solution

180
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:53,536
I promise.

181
00:14:53,537 --> 00:14:56,704
I am, do your project now?

182
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:58,072
You have every right, forget the
damn schedule

183
00:14:58,073 --> 00:15:08,434
Just come at 8:00.

184
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:10,084
You know what?

185
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:11,986
What you need is a vibrator.

186
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:13,071
No.

187
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:15,189
That gives me chills.

188
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,373
I know forget

189
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,490
We will find something here

190
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:19,375
No drugs are me

191
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,694
No, I was

192
00:15:21,695 --> 00:15:25,397
I think you should seriously consider
having a lover...

193
00:15:25,398 --> 00:15:26,849
...That is, if you do not mind

194
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,850
break your morality.

195
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:30,418
No moral dilemma,
believe me

196
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:32,222
But what was I supposed to do?

197
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,422
I look on the street

198
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:34,607
No, no.

199
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:36,992
I mean a woman.

200
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:38,110
What?

201
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:39,593
A woman's lover.

202
00:15:39,594 --> 00:15:41,195
Oh, come on.

203
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:44,732
Just listen to me and do not listen to it
OK?

204
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:47,885
A woman is much more familiar
as a manual

205
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:49,169
Who?

206
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,386
Wait.

207
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:51,437
I'm talking about a woman,

208
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:52,806
You know you have all kinds of tricks

209
00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:53,856
up his sleeve,

210
00:15:53,857 --> 00:15:56,707
used in particular situations.

211
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,758
And as usual, I can think

212
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,810
I have a second cousin who runs a

213
00:15:58,811 --> 00:16:03,366
Services company, and could
interest

214
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:07,769
A service company?

215
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,272
The black sheep of the family

216
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:11,490
Valentina is the best

217
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:15,827
women I've ever seen.

218
00:16:15,828 --> 00:16:18,712
Smoke.

219
00:16:18,713 --> 00:16:19,863
Focus. Focus

220
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:21,047
Oh, my god.

221
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:25,250
no one will know.

222
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,835
That is only for men.

223
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:27,952
Are you kidding?

224
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,672
I mean, women really do that?

225
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:31,773
Oh, of course.

226
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:38,130
You have to think of this as a
experiment right?

227
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:44,585
You hire a specific service

228
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,837
No, no, no. That's fine.

229
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,087
Nothing is too weird
for us..

230
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:50,057
What do you have to lose?

231
00:16:50,058 --> 00:17:02,366
Not much at this point.

232
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,902
Better service?

233
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:07,589
Oh, hello, Shirin.

234
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,707
No, no, I'm sure we can find

235
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,260
someone for her.

236
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:23,186
Right. Consider it done.

237
00:17:23,187 --> 00:17:25,472
Okay. This should be fun.

238
00:17:25,473 --> 00:17:26,772
this is to educate?

239
00:17:26,773 --> 00:17:28,090
Oh, yes.

240
00:17:28,091 --> 00:17:29,340
What do you have a boy virgin?

241
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,791
Calm down, Cougar.

242
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:39,252
No, is a housewife in search
an adventure

243
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:40,537
Shut the fuck up!

244
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:43,504
I refer to a customer.

245
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:44,790
Sylvie, look.

246
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,207
This is a friend of my cousin,

247
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,374
Well?

248
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,092
She has never been with
a woman before

249
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:50,810
but my cousin has explained lesbian

250
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:52,497
that women are better lovers.

251
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:54,364
Yes, I tell you what

252
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,549
And it is money.

253
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,334
So I want this to come out
really well

254
00:17:58,335 --> 00:18:00,351
Just think of all sites
'd get

255
00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:03,153
From the upper class country club

256
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:06,223
So I want to do right by
she okay?

257
00:18:06,224 --> 00:18:09,979
And besides, she wanted someone
of age

258
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,397
forgives.

259
00:18:11,398 --> 00:18:21,755
Now sing.

260
00:18:21,756 --> 00:18:23,891
This is what I sing
in hearing.

261
00:18:23,892 --> 00:18:25,274
And then, when you make a single,

262
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:27,043
I'm done with this.

263
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:28,844
And what happened to his other successes?

264
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:29,978
Sylvie, play fair.

265
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:31,762
Now, I chose for this,

266
00:18:31,763 --> 00:18:34,665
and I will not disappoint me.

267
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,317
Sylvie, do not be late.

268
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:38,869
She is strict with time.

269
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,223
You know how I hate to ask you this?

270
00:18:40,224 --> 00:18:41,607
but my name is molly

271
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:44,426
invites me to the house of
the parents of her boyfriend

272
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:46,727
so it's a great opportunity

273
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:48,163
I have to go, okay?

274
00:18:48,164 --> 00:18:52,298
Okay, is a customer chosen by Valentina

275
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,484
is crème de la crème,

276
00:18:54,485 --> 00:18:57,586
All good stuff, right?

277
00:18:57,587 --> 00:18:59,005
Oh, honey, I love you.

278
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:00,055
Christ I love you.

279
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,240
Oh shit, I forgot - um,

280
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,858
The client is strict with time

281
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:21,926
for whatever reason do not be late

282
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,295
Oh, shit.

283
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:29,931
This is crazy.

284
00:19:29,932 --> 00:19:49,067
What am I doing?

285
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,135
? I can help?

286
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:52,352
Ms.? White?

287
00:19:52,353 --> 00:19:55,571
If?

288
00:19:55,572 --> 00:19:57,691
I think he has an appointment

289
00:19:57,692 --> 00:20:01,244
I think that is wrong.

290
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:04,963
4:00?

291
00:20:04,964 --> 00:20:10,100
I think it was a kind
of misunderstanding

292
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:11,417
Well, it has opened the door

293
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,138
As if waiting
someone

294
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:15,707
and I guess you do not live here

295
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:19,678
because I was here two days ago

296
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,615
So, again, I think we have an appointment

297
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:28,601
I have an appointment if...

298
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,019
...But someone my age...

299
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,203
I understand.

300
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:32,488
Did you expect Sylvie, his usual?

301
00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:36,791
My what? Want to join?

302
00:20:36,792 --> 00:21:04,415
Come in.

303
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,502
Are you in the service?

304
00:21:07,503 --> 00:21:11,423
Oh, Sylvie.

305
00:21:11,424 --> 00:21:14,441
So this is your first time.

306
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:17,128
You are nervous.

307
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:19,948
It's perfectly natural.

308
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:24,102
But... do not worry.

309
00:21:24,103 --> 00:21:30,323
Let's go slow and easy

310
00:21:30,324 --> 00:21:33,842
As you like.

311
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:35,393
Miss, um...

312
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,578
Paris.

313
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:42,733
...Miss Paris, asked
someone my age.

314
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,752
Age is a state of mind, right?

315
00:21:45,753 --> 00:21:47,207
Maybe for you.

316
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:50,292
How many have 23?

317
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:53,611
I have 29.

318
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,862
See what I mean?

319
00:21:54,863 --> 00:21:56,213
You're not what I asked,

320
00:21:56,214 --> 00:22:00,433
and I will not pay.

321
00:22:00,434 --> 00:22:04,137
So do not start the clock
or whatever

322
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:06,005
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

323
00:22:06,006 --> 00:22:09,041
The woman who was supposed to
had to be here

324
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:19,902
has had an emergency, and she
requested change

325
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:21,586
I will not pay.

326
00:22:21,587 --> 00:22:24,605
I'm not asking you to.

327
00:22:24,606 --> 00:22:28,875
I'm just politely
goodbye

328
00:22:28,876 --> 00:22:41,485
No hard feelings.

329
00:22:41,486 --> 00:23:40,438
Hopefully next time, be
what you're looking for

330
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:43,658
Mama?

331
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:45,625
What happens?

332
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:50,397
Come sit with me.

333
00:23:50,398 --> 00:24:06,295
Just come and sit
me a minute will you?

334
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:13,551
I'm so sorry that I have not been
a good mother

335
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,020
What's wrong, Mom?

336
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:28,400
Are you going through half of a crisis
or something?

337
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:31,318
Are you okay?

338
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:37,757
Do you have any idea how much I love you?

339
00:24:37,758 --> 00:24:43,377
If it had been... stronger.

340
00:24:43,378 --> 00:24:50,284
If only I had been there as
should have been

341
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:55,775
I'm sorry.
Should have...

342
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:56,843
We agreed to
not talk about it

343
00:24:56,844 --> 00:25:00,594
I need to talk about it...

344
00:25:00,595 --> 00:25:03,180
We will never get over it.

345
00:25:03,181 --> 00:25:05,298
please?

346
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:07,684
Some things should stay
in the past, so...

347
00:25:07,685 --> 00:25:11,353
There must be something I can do

348
00:25:11,354 --> 00:25:12,821
Do not talk about it

349
00:25:12,822 --> 00:25:16,023
That? I want to do better
affection

350
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:19,610
I just want to do better

351
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:22,428
There are some things that are not
be arranged

352
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:52,322
So no.

353
00:25:52,323 --> 00:25:55,659
Ah, I see.

354
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,530
Oh, that's very cute.

355
00:25:57,531 --> 00:26:04,885
I like it.

356
00:26:04,886 --> 00:26:07,537
Yeah, well, I was not there for art

357
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:08,721
Never would only for champagne

358
00:26:08,722 --> 00:26:09,956
Okay, I admit it was for the champagne

359
00:26:09,957 --> 00:26:11,174
Yes? were there for the champagne?

360
00:26:11,175 --> 00:26:12,692
If, and art

361
00:26:12,693 --> 00:26:13,943
How was it?

362
00:26:13,944 --> 00:26:14,994
Do you remember having seen it all?

363
00:26:14,995 --> 00:26:18,362
There were great pictures and spotlights

364
00:26:18,363 --> 00:26:21,931
There was music relaxing environment

365
00:26:21,932 --> 00:26:48,172
Oooh, yes, I'm in love?
oooh

366
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,040
I am by giving you these actions

367
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,575
as part of some goods

368
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,726
Confused?

369
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:55,912
And you get it?

370
00:26:55,913 --> 00:26:58,130
What?

371
00:26:58,131 --> 00:27:02,370
It makes me sick your greed and ego together

372
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,923
What?

373
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,474
It was one thing you wanted to send
kids to Harvard

374
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:12,395
because I understand you want to be
take over the family business

375
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:17,999
And even give them 100,000 shares of
Westridge boys.

376
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,136
Mm-hmm. Look, we're not going to
have this conversation

377
00:27:22,137 --> 00:27:25,506
Will you be angry?,
and I will not change my mind.

378
00:27:25,507 --> 00:27:28,124
Look, I'm just a man
Okay?

379
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,546
I'm just the man you married.

380
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:33,081
And I think, in general, I have been
Jessica pretty good.

381
00:27:33,082 --> 00:27:37,419
I mean, she has led a good life.

382
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,970
You owe, Mason.

383
00:27:39,971 --> 00:27:42,688
What?

384
00:27:42,689 --> 00:27:44,557
Not this shit again.

385
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:45,741
You know

386
00:27:45,742 --> 00:27:50,211
Not again!

387
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,296
It was a fucking night!

388
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:57,350
One night!

389
00:27:57,351 --> 00:28:00,036
And I'm not giving this business actions
Understand?

390
00:28:00,037 --> 00:28:04,743
This business has been in my
family for 100 years.

391
00:28:04,744 --> 00:28:09,279
And that was the agreement
between you and me, all along

392
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,897
I love her.

393
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:14,400
She's not my blood, the boys themselves.

394
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:19,054
You may say I'm insensitive,
but not mine

395
00:28:19,055 --> 00:28:21,557
For the love of god wake.

396
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:23,341
This is not a kind of monarchy.

397
00:28:23,342 --> 00:28:27,344
Already the father he has never ever met

398
00:28:27,345 --> 00:28:28,829
What do you think this will do it?

399
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,664
She already feels like a citizen
second class.

400
00:28:31,665 --> 00:28:34,419
And I say that I love Beck.

401
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,837
But I will not change my mind.

402
00:28:36,838 --> 00:28:39,457
I'm going to bed now.

403
00:28:39,458 --> 00:29:28,415
Do not bother with me.

404
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:29,716
What?

405
00:29:29,717 --> 00:29:36,073
hey.

406
00:29:36,074 --> 00:30:08,336
Hey, Dad.

407
00:30:08,337 --> 00:30:09,804
We just came from there, right?,

408
00:30:09,805 --> 00:30:11,488
That does not help.

409
00:30:11,489 --> 00:30:13,307
Are you crazy?

410
00:30:13,308 --> 00:30:14,858
Do not do anything crazy.

411
00:30:14,859 --> 00:30:49,255
We totally lost

412
00:30:49,256 --> 00:30:50,956
So, we will die here.

413
00:30:50,957 --> 00:30:52,207
God.

414
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:53,558
Come!

415
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:57,144
Tell me everything.

416
00:30:57,145 --> 00:31:00,830
Nothing.

417
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:04,367
Nothing happened.

418
00:31:04,368 --> 00:31:07,637
I was so thrown had a master plan

419
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:09,491
That has always been my problem

420
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,275
but you can not plan everything

421
00:31:11,276 --> 00:31:16,647
Of course you can not prepare
for nothing right?

422
00:31:16,648 --> 00:31:19,932
There was an unexpected obstacle,

423
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:22,500
appeared a devil, when step
the door...

424
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:27,222
I liked.

425
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:29,273
What is the problem?

426
00:31:29,274 --> 00:32:26,408
Trust us,
try again

427
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:28,927
Best service.

428
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:34,548
Oh, yes, Ms. White...

429
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:36,433
So, let me see if I understand

430
00:32:36,434 --> 00:32:38,300
the same person as the last time

431
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:40,135
If.

432
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:42,840
And he wants exactly
the same place

433
00:32:42,841 --> 00:32:44,325
If.

434
00:32:44,326 --> 00:32:52,699
Consider it done.

435
00:32:52,700 --> 00:33:20,424
Okay, Sylvie.

436
00:33:20,425 --> 00:33:23,809
Oh. Well, that's enough ego wounded

437
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:39,288
I gave a shit.

438
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:42,224
I do not know what I expected.

439
00:33:42,225 --> 00:33:43,742
All right.

440
00:33:43,743 --> 00:33:47,698
Valentina knows there filly
can not tame

441
00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:50,300
So let's get down to business,
Shall we?

442
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:52,753
I have dildos with straps

443
00:33:52,754 --> 00:33:56,739
We can change.
We can do a 69 double

444
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,541
um, fingers are fine, but I prefer
only two or three

445
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:02,960
no fist I have a cyst.

446
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:08,264
But if you want the most explosive
we ecstrabang.

447
00:34:08,265 --> 00:34:10,250
Ecstra? They?

448
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:12,001
ecstrabang...

449
00:34:12,002 --> 00:34:14,621
Some ecstasy and then we do it
the one to the other

450
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:17,776
is fucking sweet.

451
00:34:17,777 --> 00:34:29,767
Uh, that's not going to happen

452
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:31,387
I know who you are.

453
00:34:31,388 --> 00:34:34,339
You who were with Paris,

454
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:42,179
when I could not come.

455
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:49,337
So... What did the two if not
mind me asking?

456
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,388
Sight

457
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:56,777
I do not know what you say, but do not spend
anything with the other girl

458
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:59,310
Paris is a woman.

459
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:00,662
Do not underestimate.

460
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:03,498
I did not do such a thing, I do not know.

461
00:35:03,499 --> 00:35:05,349
and I do not know.

462
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,802
Look, I'm sure that you take care you all
each other,

463
00:35:08,803 --> 00:35:12,571
and that's great.

464
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:14,340
But as a paying customer, I'm used

465
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:16,209
receive exactly what I ordered

466
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,264
God was right about you.

467
00:35:19,265 --> 00:35:28,787
Truth?

468
00:35:28,788 --> 00:35:30,605
Say what?

469
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:34,692
She was quite poetic - Paris.

470
00:35:34,693 --> 00:35:42,565
She said you were bitter sweet.

471
00:35:42,566 --> 00:35:44,650
Well, this is obviously not
work

472
00:35:44,651 --> 00:35:50,491
So I think it's time for you to go.

473
00:35:50,492 --> 00:35:56,629
Do you know? in minor league wives all
is exactly the same.

474
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:01,684
Hardest part of his day is trying to
figure out where he sits Mrs. Weatherby

475
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:14,993
lunch in the fucking right?

476
00:36:14,994 --> 00:36:19,999
Oh, you're really depressed, do not they?

477
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,272
Great what if? every morning
with your bran muffin

478
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:29,058
Tic-tac...

479
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:31,810
Wrong side of the clock

480
00:36:31,811 --> 00:36:38,149
I bet there's a half-empty bottle
in your sock drawer

481
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:55,349
right next to it some
Worn discs

482
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,168
This was a big mistake.

483
00:36:58,169 --> 00:37:01,821
What the hell are you going to do
when we part, anyway

484
00:37:01,822 --> 00:37:05,924
Paris and I do not answer to anyone

485
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:07,992
Nobody fucking

486
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:12,529
How about you?

487
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,847
Out.

488
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:15,147
Sorry if I made you wet your pants

489
00:37:15,148 --> 00:37:16,049
I just

490
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,501
I said out.

491
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:22,471
You know, obviously,
're looking for something

492
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:37,986
I hope you find it.
And do...

493
00:37:37,987 --> 00:38:52,868
think of you.

494
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:54,168
Why now?

495
00:38:54,169 --> 00:38:56,974
I mean I do not understand
what you saw in Mason.

496
00:38:56,975 --> 00:38:59,743
I mean you thought were
love with him right?

497
00:38:59,744 --> 00:39:04,347
As secretary attached to it for 2 years
I found it quite good

498
00:39:04,348 --> 00:39:05,765
Okay, I understand.

499
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:08,716
Well, yes, when you have a baby
security also has

500
00:39:08,717 --> 00:39:10,101
It is like having a dog.

501
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:11,586
No, that's what I'm saying.

502
00:39:11,587 --> 00:39:12,737
these made a good mother

503
00:39:12,738 --> 00:39:13,937
I mean...

504
00:39:13,938 --> 00:39:15,939
All I want is you
bad times pass

505
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,507
For drinking.

506
00:39:17,508 --> 00:39:20,693
Yeah, yeah, I've been told.

507
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:24,280
You are so lucky.

508
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:25,930
How does it feel?

509
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:29,686
At what level?

510
00:39:29,687 --> 00:39:34,340
Being in love with Kelly...

511
00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:40,462
It... optimistic.

512
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:43,280
Erotic.

513
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:45,032
Delicious.

514
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:49,253
Magic.

515
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:51,604
Frankly mystique.

516
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:53,172
But, you know, these are just words

517
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:58,243
You know, I mean really
I want the feel

518
00:39:58,244 --> 00:39:59,830
That was the plan.

519
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:04,285
Asking the plan do not let
you stop that witch

520
00:40:04,286 --> 00:40:08,370
asks Paris next time.

521
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:11,506
But I'm serious, Becks, no passes
the rest of your life alone

522
00:40:11,507 --> 00:41:17,197
Do not.

523
00:41:17,198 --> 00:41:20,433
I wanted to thank you for coming.

524
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:24,720
Third time charming

525
00:41:24,721 --> 00:41:28,991
I'm a little uncomfortable here

526
00:41:28,992 --> 00:41:31,009
Long time

527
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:33,347
What?

528
00:41:33,348 --> 00:41:36,450
time control.

529
00:41:36,451 --> 00:41:38,301
Do not worry.

530
00:41:38,302 --> 00:41:40,520
Receive the value of their money.

531
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:49,845
That's... very good, funny, um...

532
00:41:49,846 --> 00:41:53,196
Want a drink?

533
00:41:53,197 --> 00:41:56,615
No. But... forward.

534
00:41:56,616 --> 00:42:04,724
No babies?

535
00:42:04,725 --> 00:42:07,226
I just came from the area.

536
00:42:07,227 --> 00:42:13,365
I like to focus on the details,
try to stay calm.

537
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:14,933
You take your job seriously.

538
00:42:14,934 --> 00:42:25,508
Yes, I know.

539
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:30,296
Then...

540
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:57,320
What I can do for you?

541
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:59,272
Have you done this to men?

542
00:42:59,273 --> 00:43:04,710
This? not.

543
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:06,027
Are you a lesbian?

544
00:43:06,028 --> 00:43:10,565
Oh, god, no.

545
00:43:10,566 --> 00:43:14,921
For some reason, I thought that, um

546
00:43:14,922 --> 00:43:25,312
could somehow be easier
with a woman

547
00:43:25,313 --> 00:43:29,598
I want to know which is the passion.

548
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,535
I want to know how you feel an orgasm.

549
00:43:33,536 --> 00:43:43,295
Well they are two
distinctly different things.

550
00:43:43,296 --> 00:43:52,302
It will be what you want...
or need

551
00:43:52,303 --> 00:43:59,208
But I think I should be clear.

552
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:05,931
An orgasm is a physical phenomenon

553
00:44:05,932 --> 00:44:12,655
and I can help there.

554
00:44:12,656 --> 00:44:25,115
Passion is something completely different

555
00:44:25,116 --> 00:44:28,368
No more watches

556
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:49,170
No... blouses

557
00:44:49,171 --> 00:44:55,492
Just...

558
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:59,347
Lean back.

559
00:44:59,348 --> 00:45:01,464
Relax.

560
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:02,782
Dad, can I have the corvette?

561
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:18,714
Yes, but you know, you have to go
to work for it

562
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:25,453
Mama, what's wrong?

563
00:45:25,454 --> 00:45:27,871
Something you want to tell us

564
00:45:27,872 --> 00:45:30,057
No.

565
00:45:30,058 --> 00:45:33,075
The wedding ring?

566
00:45:33,076 --> 00:45:34,259
Oh, that.

567
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:39,347
I, uh, I, uh, leave it in the gym

568
00:45:39,348 --> 00:45:43,770
I already called.
And is safe and sound.

569
00:45:43,771 --> 00:45:47,707
Good, because worth a fortune.

570
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:51,243
Those things are definitely not cheap

571
00:45:51,244 --> 00:45:55,062
Just... wondering if it's worth

572
00:45:55,063 --> 00:45:57,348
That, marry, and raise a family?
Are you kidding? 'And that girl?

573
00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:01,185
Could not be better, you choose your own

574
00:46:01,186 --> 00:46:10,041
But did you... yourself chose

575
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:12,577
But, uh, chicken, Mason?

576
00:46:12,578 --> 00:46:13,980
No, thanks.

577
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:20,153
No, thanks.

578
00:46:20,154 --> 00:46:32,596
Well, there was a Jew, a German,
and a Frenchman

579
00:46:32,597 --> 00:46:36,397
I can not. I'm sorry to make you
waste time

580
00:46:36,398 --> 00:46:42,387
There's a reason you're here.

581
00:46:42,388 --> 00:47:16,686
I can not.

582
00:47:16,687 --> 00:47:20,039
So I wanted something very special
but I have not decided

583
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,392
And it took me a long time right?

584
00:47:23,393 --> 00:47:25,176
Yes, I know.

585
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:26,361
I'll show you in a minute.

586
00:47:26,362 --> 00:47:27,394
See

587
00:47:27,395 --> 00:47:29,898
Well I do not really know if
your fault or dummy,

588
00:47:29,899 --> 00:47:31,181
but I am angry.

589
00:47:31,182 --> 00:48:08,681
He wanted me to give you this.

590
00:48:08,682 --> 00:48:12,467
Okay.

591
00:48:12,468 --> 00:48:16,186
I needed that.

592
00:48:16,187 --> 00:48:18,441
Best service.

593
00:48:18,442 --> 00:48:21,977
Oh, yes.

594
00:48:21,978 --> 00:48:22,428
Oh, yes, of course.

595
00:48:22,429 --> 00:48:26,615
Used and needed glasses

596
00:48:26,616 --> 00:48:33,537
need inflatable elephant and gorilla.

597
00:48:33,538 --> 00:48:39,257
Certainly would not want to take
the wrong animal

598
00:48:39,258 --> 00:48:41,009
Genial.

599
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:44,846
Oh, uh, sorry, can you wait a minute?

600
00:48:44,847 --> 00:48:46,164
Best service.

601
00:48:46,165 --> 00:48:49,350
Yes, I am Mrs. White

602
00:48:49,351 --> 00:48:51,138
Yes, yes.

603
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:52,388
Does my ring?

604
00:48:52,389 --> 00:48:54,106
I should have left it at the hotel.

605
00:48:54,107 --> 00:48:55,358
Yes, yes.

606
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:56,675
She said she would leave on the table.

607
00:48:56,676 --> 00:48:58,543
Ah, well.

608
00:48:58,544 --> 00:49:00,278
No, no. Do not worry.
these things happen.

609
00:49:00,279 --> 00:49:01,662
I can go get it now.

610
00:49:01,663 --> 00:49:05,766
Well, actually, not in the office.

611
00:49:05,767 --> 00:49:08,434
She said she wanted to reschedule

612
00:49:08,435 --> 00:49:12,788
in the same place but at seven
pm and it will take

613
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:14,840
What?

614
00:49:14,841 --> 00:49:17,657
He agreed with the arrangement.

615
00:49:17,658 --> 00:49:19,676
Mrs. White?

616
00:49:19,677 --> 00:49:21,698
confirmed?

617
00:49:21,699 --> 00:50:12,675
little witch.

618
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:18,796
Got my ring?

619
00:50:18,797 --> 00:50:28,140
Well, you've got it?

620
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:30,842
Bonito.

621
00:50:30,843 --> 00:50:32,360
It is very very expensive.

622
00:50:32,361 --> 00:50:34,880
And if you think I do not know what I have

623
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:37,481
You must think I was born yesterday.

624
00:50:37,482 --> 00:50:38,631
Sorry.

625
00:50:38,632 --> 00:50:42,151
You are just too much.

626
00:50:42,152 --> 00:50:45,370
What's that supposed to mean?

627
00:50:45,371 --> 00:50:52,410
Nothing at all.

628
00:50:52,411 --> 00:50:53,794
Wait!

629
00:50:53,795 --> 00:50:57,616
Wait a minute.

630
00:50:57,617 --> 00:51:18,234
You want to come here?

631
00:51:18,235 --> 00:51:20,051
Sorry.

632
00:51:20,052 --> 00:51:23,370
It was unforgivable.

633
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,105
I do not know why I said that.

634
00:51:25,106 --> 00:51:27,459
I had to get my ring.

635
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,979
Got it back

636
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,630
You do not understand.

637
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:32,731
My husband would kill me!

638
00:51:32,732 --> 00:51:35,467
I could never understand as
losing something so precious

639
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:38,102
Beautiful, value?

640
00:51:38,103 --> 00:51:40,420
Beautiful, important?

641
00:51:40,421 --> 00:51:44,123
It is very valuable.

642
00:51:44,124 --> 00:51:47,876
Important?

643
00:51:47,877 --> 00:52:04,409
Not so much.

644
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:05,527
Sorry.

645
00:52:05,528 --> 00:52:06,877
Want one?

646
00:52:06,878 --> 00:52:08,162
If.

647
00:52:08,163 --> 00:52:14,134
It's been a long day.

648
00:52:14,135 --> 00:52:16,786
As... How many?

649
00:52:16,787 --> 00:52:19,470
I can not talk business...

650
00:52:19,471 --> 00:52:21,290
Ms. White

651
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:28,431
I, um... Rebecca is

652
00:52:28,432 --> 00:52:30,482
And, uh, I'll pay, of course

653
00:52:30,483 --> 00:52:36,004
I just get my ring.

654
00:52:36,005 --> 00:52:38,990
No...

655
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:40,140
Do not.

656
00:52:40,141 --> 00:52:45,395
Oh, yes I will, actually.

657
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:54,352
Ever... You can stop and let
playing with things

658
00:52:54,353 --> 00:53:06,197
No, I do not.

659
00:53:06,198 --> 00:53:13,219
Why do you think I'm here?

660
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:22,294
Nothing will happen I do not want

661
00:53:22,295 --> 00:53:29,249
But, unless you tell me

662
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:35,490
Otherwise, I will kiss you, Rebecca

663
00:53:35,491 --> 00:54:14,858
That is... all

664
00:54:14,859 --> 00:54:20,280
Sorry.

665
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:37,478
I can not.

666
00:54:37,479 --> 00:54:41,332
He said he signed all because of a
internal investigation

667
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:47,020
He is trying to ensure that if,
Westridge amalgamated

668
00:54:47,021 --> 00:54:49,705
have to file bankruptcy,
Westridge States

669
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:51,890
would not be affected.

670
00:54:51,891 --> 00:54:53,808
If we proceed with this plan,

671
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:56,277
Do you understand what you are doing?

672
00:54:56,278 --> 00:54:57,628
If.

673
00:54:57,629 --> 00:54:59,897
You will own the rights to vote

674
00:54:59,898 --> 00:55:03,933
and monetary value of
Westridge together.

675
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:06,872
You must rely heavily on

676
00:55:06,873 --> 00:55:08,840
If.

677
00:55:08,841 --> 00:55:12,260
He does.

678
00:55:12,261 --> 00:55:13,978
But still be able to be CEO

679
00:55:13,979 --> 00:55:17,280
and maintain their current lifestyle right?

680
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:18,780
In much.

681
00:55:18,781 --> 00:55:25,270
But like the rest of the shares
most will be yours

682
00:55:25,271 --> 00:55:27,155
and he will surrender

683
00:55:27,156 --> 00:55:33,860
can not do anything.

684
00:55:33,861 --> 00:55:38,317
Since we have exhausted all
treatments,

685
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:41,420
I think it's time to tell the family
and loved ones

686
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,805
Once you reach
a certain progression

687
00:55:43,806 --> 00:55:47,340
symptoms will go faster.

688
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:51,577
You will need to be prepared and
as the end is nearer

689
00:55:51,578 --> 00:55:52,895
He will need help.

690
00:55:52,896 --> 00:55:56,431
I promise I will do my best
to not have pain

691
00:55:56,432 --> 00:57:56,656
I want to make tolerable as
possible.

692
00:57:56,657 --> 00:58:00,041
I guess dad really does not respond
the question right?

693
00:58:00,042 --> 00:58:02,042
But the only thing is you can answer

694
00:58:02,043 --> 00:58:04,160
Is it worth to you?

695
00:58:04,161 --> 00:58:07,081
Yes, of course it is.

696
00:58:07,082 --> 00:58:12,054
What about Emily? You're not
in love with Janice, not so.

697
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:18,209
With Emily, you are the one for the other,
and Janice, she is...

698
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:22,879
Hey, we have a lot in common.

699
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:32,119
The only thing you have in common
is third generation, much wealth

700
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:36,239
You're not in suits and ties are more

701
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:47,118
flip flops and T-shirts
with the slogan dorky.

702
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,556
So do not do it if you're unsure.

703
00:58:51,557 --> 00:58:55,258
is for the rest of your life.

704
00:58:55,259 --> 00:59:01,179
I want you to be happy, that's all

705
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:12,489
Just remember not too late.

706
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:17,745
I have to say, Rebecca,
has balls,

707
00:59:17,746 --> 01:00:52,564
I mean a solid cast iron
as a rock, lady balls

708
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:55,083
I...

709
01:00:55,084 --> 01:07:18,239
I am available.

710
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,524
Where is it?

711
01:07:19,525 --> 01:07:20,524
right?

712
01:07:20,525 --> 01:07:21,842
I know.

713
01:07:21,843 --> 01:07:25,962
For dinner mom loses?
Especially this one.

714
01:07:25,963 --> 01:07:30,650
Did I hear my name?

715
01:07:30,651 --> 01:07:38,658
You're not ready.

716
01:07:38,659 --> 01:07:50,868
Janice, I'm sorry, honey.
um, something came up.

717
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:57,240
Order pizza, and, um, back in
a couple of hours

718
01:07:57,241 --> 01:08:02,144
And Janice, tomorrow night, uh,
I arrange.

719
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:03,529
Uh, sorry.

720
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:05,699
I promise.

721
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:09,319
Tomorrow. um, fun.

722
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,138
Seriously?

723
01:08:11,139 --> 01:08:15,841
Uh, yeah, do not know why not as
junk food.

724
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:17,042
Anything.

725
01:08:17,043 --> 01:08:21,079
Um, Aaron, I need you to call
Chez sous les meilleurs, okay?

726
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,113
Maybe we could order pizza?

727
01:08:23,114 --> 01:08:25,365
I support pizza.

728
01:08:25,366 --> 01:08:26,616
No.

729
01:08:26,617 --> 01:08:35,490
Concombres Épinards and à la grecque
with focaccia okay?

730
01:08:35,491 --> 01:08:39,012
Okay, my need for protein
and I would fit in my Vera Wang

731
01:08:39,013 --> 01:08:40,530
I have to make a call.

732
01:08:40,531 --> 01:08:41,665
Well, honey.

733
01:08:41,666 --> 01:08:45,450
Yes, Aaron, I like any kind of bread.
Please

734
01:08:45,451 --> 01:08:47,169
Fuck you.

735
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:49,271
Wow, Aaron.

736
01:08:49,272 --> 01:08:52,140
So what was that?

737
01:08:52,141 --> 01:08:53,257
The spinach salad.

738
01:08:53,258 --> 01:08:55,326
I do not talk crazy.
I'm talking about mom.

739
01:08:55,327 --> 01:08:56,594
That was weird.

740
01:08:56,595 --> 01:08:57,777
Super rare.

741
01:08:57,778 --> 01:08:58,913
If.

742
01:08:58,914 --> 01:09:02,581
It was exhausting.

743
01:09:02,582 --> 01:09:10,390
Well, you and the diva will
so happy together

744
01:09:10,391 --> 01:09:22,251
Pizza!

745
01:09:22,252 --> 01:09:25,236
No, I hate my stomach.

746
01:09:25,237 --> 01:09:30,857
I have not been to the gym for a long

747
01:09:30,858 --> 01:09:39,384
I used to have a very good body before
of children and menopause

748
01:09:39,385 --> 01:09:43,153
I never came across to you, though.

749
01:09:43,154 --> 01:09:48,190
This does not mean anything

750
01:09:48,191 --> 01:09:54,029
Rebecca.

751
01:09:54,030 --> 01:10:00,049
I... I hate it when I did this.

752
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:04,003
Why did you do that?

753
01:10:04,004 --> 01:10:12,245
It was a birthday present from Mason.

754
01:10:12,246 --> 01:10:19,469
loves perfection
thing we have in common.

755
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:28,759
I spent my whole life trying
from perfect

756
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,211
I never felt...

757
01:10:31,212 --> 01:10:36,498
Good enough or
thin enough,

758
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:47,744
Pretty nice enough
Smart.

759
01:10:47,745 --> 01:10:52,748
All things...

760
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:56,667
we are not perfect

761
01:10:56,668 --> 01:11:06,392
are what they do so well
about us

762
01:11:06,393 --> 01:11:21,891
It's who you are, Rebecca.
Perfect

763
01:11:21,892 --> 01:11:27,244
You make me feel that way...

764
01:11:27,245 --> 01:11:36,968
My beautiful girl.

765
01:11:36,969 --> 01:11:41,941
It's official
exploded.

766
01:11:41,942 --> 01:11:43,762
26 appear to have

767
01:11:43,763 --> 01:11:47,381
Right?

768
01:11:47,382 --> 01:11:57,439
It is so exquisite.

769
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,841
Well, is sexually satisfied.

770
01:12:00,842 --> 01:12:03,194
Okay, okay.

771
01:12:03,195 --> 01:12:04,562
I'm glad you're here.

772
01:12:04,563 --> 01:12:07,997
I was not a fan.

773
01:12:07,998 --> 01:12:10,265
I've corrupted

774
01:12:10,266 --> 01:12:11,467
I hope you're proud

775
01:12:11,468 --> 01:12:14,268
Well, I feel
I deserve to enjoy it

776
01:12:14,269 --> 01:12:15,388
It's so bad.

777
01:12:15,389 --> 01:12:17,440
We took our girl to school,

778
01:12:17,441 --> 01:12:19,008
and has earned an outstanding diving lost

779
01:12:19,009 --> 01:12:42,344
impressive.

780
01:12:42,345 --> 01:12:47,167
You know I love you, but always
've had a tree in your butt

781
01:12:47,168 --> 01:12:49,703
I think what I say is my humble

782
01:12:49,704 --> 01:12:54,807
Becks, is that... not only could
be more excited

783
01:12:54,808 --> 01:12:56,341
Thank you.

784
01:12:56,342 --> 01:12:58,393
I think I would like my children.

785
01:12:58,394 --> 01:13:02,279
Jessica is my first.

786
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,381
Hank Aaron and I have.

787
01:13:04,382 --> 01:13:06,433
Obviously Mason made

788
01:13:06,434 --> 01:13:07,951
Baseball fans and Hank Aaron.

789
01:13:07,952 --> 01:13:11,003
Byron is one of my favorite poets

790
01:13:11,004 --> 01:13:13,772
Do you read for me please?

791
01:13:13,773 --> 01:13:16,425
"'Go and ask Maude to get here

792
01:13:16,426 --> 01:13:18,629
Never happened to her probably

793
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:21,314
My God, this act is over...

794
01:13:21,315 --> 01:13:29,304
Our little secret, Maude. "

795
01:13:29,305 --> 01:13:30,521
If.

796
01:13:30,522 --> 01:13:35,709
Really?

797
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:39,144
So where will this go?

798
01:13:39,145 --> 01:13:41,430
I do not care...

799
01:13:41,431 --> 01:13:43,016
really.

800
01:13:43,017 --> 01:13:48,019
first I will not look
a motive or a reason

801
01:13:48,020 --> 01:14:26,757
I do, I'll just enjoy
until the last moment

802
01:14:26,758 --> 01:14:29,241
Oh, my god

803
01:14:29,242 --> 01:14:31,059
What?

804
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:35,646
I missed dinner,
I have not even called

805
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,730
Order.

806
01:14:36,731 --> 01:14:39,549
Oh, sorry.

807
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:49,324
Just... before you go, yo...

808
01:14:49,325 --> 01:14:53,313
You are so amazing.

809
01:14:53,314 --> 01:14:59,701
Oh, I'm in love
your mouth

810
01:14:59,702 --> 01:15:01,669
They'll be worried.

811
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:03,888
Thank you, Paris.

812
01:15:03,889 --> 01:15:18,884
Thank you.

813
01:15:18,885 --> 01:15:22,857
I do not like mom has not called,
I'm starting to worry a bit

814
01:15:22,858 --> 01:15:28,495
Yes, never lost the family dinner

815
01:15:28,496 --> 01:15:31,947
Maybe... are together

816
01:15:31,948 --> 01:15:34,216
No, find a way to
tell us something

817
01:15:34,217 --> 01:15:35,883
So how should we act?
as if nothing had happened

818
01:15:35,884 --> 01:15:40,187
Yes, I think we should not
say anything to mom.

819
01:15:40,188 --> 01:15:42,856
Or Dad, until we say so

820
01:15:42,857 --> 01:15:51,463
In accordance

821
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:52,647
Um, sorry.

822
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:56,936
I, um - I got stuck on the road

823
01:15:56,937 --> 01:16:00,973
by accident and mobile without battery

824
01:16:00,974 --> 01:16:03,158
I am - I, uh...

825
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:05,009
Does Papa is not with you?

826
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:09,797
No.

827
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:10,931
Why? Are they not here?

828
01:16:10,932 --> 01:16:18,121
No, and we all know why.

829
01:16:18,122 --> 01:16:23,224
You all know what?

830
01:16:23,225 --> 01:16:25,112
Wait.

831
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:26,496
Give it to me.

832
01:16:26,497 --> 01:16:27,563
Give it to me.

833
01:16:27,564 --> 01:16:28,613
What?

834
01:16:28,614 --> 01:16:49,665
Just...

835
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:51,784
No, we draw conclusions

836
01:16:51,785 --> 01:16:54,552
That can not be overlooked breast.

837
01:16:54,553 --> 01:16:58,825
I was in the office looking potato
a document for tomorrow

838
01:16:58,826 --> 01:17:00,559
I went through his desk and found this

839
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,328
I know I should not have, but...

840
01:17:03,329 --> 01:17:05,213
has been having all these
work problems

841
01:17:05,214 --> 01:17:08,299
He is trying to convert the company
and is succeeding

842
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,017
You know, that's what I thought was

843
01:17:10,018 --> 01:17:12,352
I thought all-nighters

844
01:17:12,353 --> 01:17:15,088
If, temperament, all day drinking

845
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:17,074
I mean, Mom, you know.

846
01:17:17,075 --> 01:17:20,025
Let's calm down

847
01:17:20,026 --> 01:17:23,628
I need to listen
sincerely

848
01:17:23,629 --> 01:17:24,979
You will not say a word

849
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,113
What?

850
01:17:26,114 --> 01:17:27,234
Did you know?

851
01:17:27,235 --> 01:17:31,120
You will not say anything
I say very seriously

852
01:17:31,121 --> 01:17:32,521
I'll talk to your father and...

853
01:17:32,522 --> 01:17:33,773
Sure, you will speak to all

854
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:35,540
Do not say a word until

855
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:37,676
I have spoken to him. Is that clear?

856
01:17:37,677 --> 01:17:42,229
Insurance.

857
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:46,099
This changes everything

858
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:49,701
You're right.

859
01:17:49,702 --> 01:18:42,150
It will.

860
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:44,419
When did you know?

861
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:56,161
What?

862
01:18:56,162 --> 01:18:59,179
What do you mean?

863
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:03,803
When did you know?

864
01:19:03,804 --> 01:19:11,042
Well, a few weeks ago

865
01:19:11,043 --> 01:19:16,380
I went to see Dr. Weller.

866
01:19:16,381 --> 01:19:19,699
Rebecca know what happens

867
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:22,819
I mean, for us, for family, for children

868
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:27,388
and the company, for the love of god

869
01:19:27,389 --> 01:19:30,241
I think so.

870
01:19:30,242 --> 01:19:35,113
So, yes, then.
Well...

871
01:19:35,114 --> 01:19:39,301
Let's fix it then, right?

872
01:19:39,302 --> 01:19:41,503
Let's fix it.

873
01:19:41,504 --> 01:19:57,148
We'll fix it before it's too late

874
01:19:57,149 --> 01:20:12,430
I hope you believe me and understand...
when I say I'm sorry

875
01:20:12,431 --> 01:20:18,285
really sorry. Mason

876
01:20:18,286 --> 01:20:22,873
But I think we both know...

877
01:20:22,874 --> 01:20:42,958
It's too late.

878
01:20:42,959 --> 01:20:47,878
He said it was cancer, and metastases

879
01:20:47,879 --> 01:20:49,812
I can not believe this.

880
01:20:49,813 --> 01:20:52,131
Honey, are you sure

881
01:20:52,132 --> 01:20:54,449
If.

882
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,034
But you need from us?

883
01:20:56,035 --> 01:20:59,437
Help to keep us together
for them now

884
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:07,897
Okay.

885
01:21:07,898 --> 01:21:11,033
How many people can do?

886
01:21:11,034 --> 01:21:14,352
Strangers.

887
01:21:14,353 --> 01:21:20,457
Do not do that.

888
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:27,147
I know you do not like looking into,
but you can live differently

889
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:28,380
I mean, look at you.

890
01:21:28,381 --> 01:21:33,735
Seriously, you're beautiful, you're smart,
you are a gem.

891
01:21:33,736 --> 01:21:35,986
Why this?

892
01:21:35,987 --> 01:21:39,908
I earn $ 200,000 a year clean.

893
01:21:39,909 --> 01:21:42,594
I make my own schedule...

894
01:21:42,595 --> 01:21:44,880
And I get to return.

895
01:21:44,881 --> 01:21:46,931
Return?

896
01:21:46,932 --> 01:21:49,049
Return?

897
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:50,667
I'm a little lost here.

898
01:21:50,668 --> 01:21:52,269
nothing.

899
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:53,986
No. What it means?

900
01:21:53,987 --> 01:21:55,938
I want to know why you do this.

901
01:21:55,939 --> 01:21:58,990
What are you doing here?

902
01:21:58,991 --> 01:22:06,413
I want to know.

903
01:22:06,414 --> 01:22:12,338
Please do not take this the wrong way,
I do not expect anything really

904
01:22:12,339 --> 01:22:15,190
I just want you to tell me...

905
01:22:15,191 --> 01:22:19,376
For once in my life...

906
01:22:19,377 --> 01:22:21,978
and seriously.

907
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:24,064
I...

908
01:22:24,065 --> 01:22:29,285
you...

909
01:22:29,286 --> 01:22:43,181
want.

910
01:22:43,182 --> 01:22:44,517
We will have to go through.

911
01:22:44,518 --> 01:22:46,601
Honey, it's time.

912
01:22:46,602 --> 01:22:47,919
No, we're down here.

913
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,037
Just leave this place,
Okay?

914
01:22:49,038 --> 01:22:51,205
I thought maybe...

915
01:22:51,206 --> 01:22:54,457
You need to tell what happened

916
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:55,508
Because if I'm with you, I am,

917
01:22:55,509 --> 01:23:02,448
Like, very lost.

918
01:23:02,449 --> 01:23:07,752
In fact look at the last group
tree ends there.

919
01:23:07,753 --> 01:23:09,170
We must go investigate,

920
01:23:09,171 --> 01:23:10,040
Do not you think?

921
01:23:10,041 --> 01:23:12,042
We must go investigate right?

922
01:23:12,043 --> 01:23:17,795
You had your chance.

923
01:23:17,796 --> 01:23:43,619
You had your chance.

924
01:23:43,620 --> 01:25:41,706
To!

925
01:25:41,707 --> 01:26:00,991
This is not about me, Rebecca.

926
01:26:00,992 --> 01:26:11,933
I want to taste.

927
01:26:11,934 --> 01:28:19,463
Oh, I love the way you smell.

928
01:28:19,464 --> 01:28:22,168
You know, I've been working for
my five years

929
01:28:22,169 --> 01:28:23,753
I've never seen that.

930
01:28:23,754 --> 01:28:27,138
has not taken a client as
Six weeks?

931
01:28:27,139 --> 01:28:29,590
And do not even try to tell me
you've been busy

932
01:28:29,591 --> 01:28:32,676
because I know what I've been busy

933
01:28:32,677 --> 01:28:38,815
Must stop now for your own good

934
01:28:38,816 --> 01:28:39,832
I do not want to stop.

935
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:42,584
I know not.

936
01:28:42,585 --> 01:28:47,521
But I've seen it happen so many girls
same in freefall

937
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:49,640
Not so.

938
01:28:49,641 --> 01:28:52,292
It never is.

939
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:54,880
But it never ends well.

940
01:28:54,881 --> 01:29:00,151
I have to.
Sorry

941
01:29:00,152 --> 01:29:04,137
Sorry.

942
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:32,814
Back, girl.

943
01:29:32,815 --> 01:30:10,830
Damn, girl.

944
01:30:10,831 --> 01:30:15,433
This work of art you do, Paris
is seriously impressive.

945
01:30:15,434 --> 01:30:18,451
Was this what you used to do?

946
01:30:18,452 --> 01:30:19,870
is a hobby.

947
01:30:19,871 --> 01:30:22,390
I love this.
It's so cute.

948
01:30:22,391 --> 01:30:25,408
Honey, this is not a hobby.

949
01:30:25,409 --> 01:30:29,381
You're very talented.
I'm not kidding

950
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:34,151
Tell me.

951
01:30:34,152 --> 01:30:37,103
Well... the point is...

952
01:30:37,104 --> 01:30:42,926
the order of the points.

953
01:30:42,927 --> 01:30:46,561
In itself...

954
01:30:46,562 --> 01:30:49,881
What is true?

955
01:30:49,882 --> 01:30:53,784
nothing.

956
01:30:53,785 --> 01:30:58,574
But when you put one here...

957
01:30:58,575 --> 01:31:01,659
And here...

958
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:04,445
And here...

959
01:31:04,446 --> 01:31:10,767
Everything is fun apparently...

960
01:31:10,768 --> 01:31:14,653
life as disjointed pieces

961
01:31:14,654 --> 01:31:22,960
Somehow, all
magically together

962
01:31:22,961 --> 01:31:25,880
Each particle...

963
01:31:25,881 --> 01:31:34,155
each part...

964
01:31:34,156 --> 01:31:38,142
Everything comes together...

965
01:31:38,143 --> 01:33:06,204
to create a complete picture.

966
01:33:06,205 --> 01:33:11,475
He ordered me to give you this after
funeral

967
01:33:11,476 --> 01:33:13,377
I'm sorry.

968
01:33:13,378 --> 01:33:25,820
Who are you?

969
01:33:25,821 --> 01:33:27,737
I have to say. In all years,

970
01:33:27,738 --> 01:33:34,329
Never has perplexed me a customer so far.

971
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:38,817
Okay, so here's the truth.

972
01:33:38,818 --> 01:33:41,702
I watch a lot of telenovelas.

973
01:33:41,703 --> 01:33:44,387
So when I got your call,

974
01:33:44,388 --> 01:33:47,089
First I thought: 'Oh,

975
01:33:47,090 --> 01:33:49,375
must be Mrs. White devil ".

976
01:33:49,376 --> 01:33:54,013
Or you were going to blackmail Valentina,
I do not recommend,

977
01:33:54,014 --> 01:33:57,814
crazy bitch because it's legal.

978
01:33:57,815 --> 01:34:07,192
My favorite is that you want to join
Valentina at club

979
01:34:07,193 --> 01:34:20,719
No.

980
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:23,004
Thank you.

981
01:34:23,005 --> 01:34:27,274
I needed that.

982
01:34:27,275 --> 01:34:31,879
And thanks for meeting me

983
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:33,713
What I can do for you?

984
01:34:33,714 --> 01:34:34,797
When the time comes, I would

985
01:34:34,798 --> 01:34:39,855
You give it to Paris.

986
01:34:39,856 --> 01:34:40,855
is a gift.

987
01:34:40,856 --> 01:34:42,840
She'll know what it means.

988
01:34:42,841 --> 01:34:43,891
yes, but you see almost every day

989
01:34:43,892 --> 01:34:45,892
Why not give it to you?

990
01:34:45,893 --> 01:34:48,611
No, I...

991
01:34:48,612 --> 01:34:53,782
I could see Paris in recent days

992
01:34:53,783 --> 01:34:59,237
Ohh, fight lover.
Forgiveness

993
01:34:59,238 --> 01:35:02,689
Well, well, have you lost in the shadows?

994
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:03,723
I can not see you.

995
01:35:03,724 --> 01:35:16,287
It drives me crazy.

996
01:35:16,288 --> 01:35:19,856
Last night was really crazy

997
01:35:19,857 --> 01:35:21,824
This is important.

998
01:35:21,825 --> 01:35:24,243
I want her out.

999
01:35:24,244 --> 01:35:30,697
Did you ever think that we
this because we like

1000
01:35:30,698 --> 01:35:35,569
we are proud of our work
we've had opportunities?

1001
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:39,675
You, if...

1002
01:35:39,676 --> 01:35:44,963
But not Paris

1003
01:35:44,964 --> 01:35:59,958
You really care about her, right?

1004
01:35:59,959 --> 01:36:02,676
I'm in love with her.

1005
01:36:02,677 --> 01:36:07,497
Yes, you are.

1006
01:36:07,498 --> 01:36:09,298
But I hate to say,

1007
01:36:09,299 --> 01:36:14,104
It will not be the last.

1008
01:36:14,105 --> 01:36:19,843
I need to be his last client

1009
01:36:19,844 --> 01:36:22,328
She trusts you, Sylvie.

1010
01:36:22,329 --> 01:36:27,616
She trusts you, that it is

1011
01:36:27,617 --> 01:36:30,851
I will not see Paris again

1012
01:36:30,852 --> 01:36:34,820
He learned your husband, right?

1013
01:36:34,821 --> 01:36:44,515
Would you like soap operas?

1014
01:36:44,516 --> 01:36:48,069
I'm dying...

1015
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:52,588
cancer.

1016
01:36:52,589 --> 01:37:01,779
I have not much time, start
have some physical disorders

1017
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:07,134
I do not want to see me like Paris

1018
01:37:07,135 --> 01:37:09,969
I want you to remember me well

1019
01:37:09,970 --> 01:37:12,487
Of course you do.

1020
01:37:12,488 --> 01:37:13,908
Remember the good things.

1021
01:37:13,909 --> 01:37:17,094
Okay, listen to me.

1022
01:37:17,095 --> 01:37:20,782
You have to say goodbye

1023
01:37:20,783 --> 01:37:21,932
You have to.

1024
01:37:21,933 --> 01:37:24,218
You know what.

1025
01:37:24,219 --> 01:37:29,588
Look, I know you're scared.

1026
01:37:29,589 --> 01:37:32,840
One can not simply
disappear.

1027
01:37:32,841 --> 01:37:33,858
and I do not want you to worry

1028
01:37:33,859 --> 01:37:37,827
about Paris because I
be with her

1029
01:37:37,828 --> 01:37:41,047
I'm going to put on my
back pocket

1030
01:37:41,048 --> 01:37:43,599
Well? I take care of Paris,

1031
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,836
You have to tell her

1032
01:37:44,837 --> 01:37:48,522
And not just for her...

1033
01:37:48,523 --> 01:37:52,642
But for you.

1034
01:37:52,643 --> 01:37:56,695
For you.

1035
01:37:56,696 --> 01:38:01,049
So, as we say in the business,

1036
01:38:01,050 --> 01:40:14,767
Women on Top.

1037
01:40:14,768 --> 01:40:20,492
I need to say goodbye.

1038
01:40:20,493 --> 01:40:21,943
What happens?

1039
01:40:21,944 --> 01:40:24,093
I love you.

1040
01:40:24,094 --> 01:40:27,164
If you really want this...

1041
01:40:27,165 --> 01:40:29,883
I'll have this.

1042
01:40:29,884 --> 01:40:33,069
I've wanted this all my life.

1043
01:40:33,070 --> 01:41:33,539
And I gave my

1044
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:39,344
Hi, honey.

1045
01:41:39,345 --> 01:41:42,996
Are you okay?

1046
01:41:42,997 --> 01:41:46,249
See you at the house.

1047
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:53,054
Your mother hired me to work
for you whenever you need me.

1048
01:41:53,055 --> 01:41:54,175
Uh, what's this?

1049
01:41:54,176 --> 01:41:57,594
Your mother remade his will

1050
01:41:57,595 --> 01:42:03,215
She was busy the
recent months.

1051
01:42:03,216 --> 01:42:08,637
All this will be clear when you
able to read through it.

1052
01:42:08,638 --> 01:42:09,521
Are you well?

1053
01:42:09,522 --> 01:42:10,922
If.

1054
01:42:10,923 --> 01:42:18,511
I wanted to make sure that
you would not need anything.

1055
01:42:18,512 --> 01:42:26,936
She was sure that there would be some
rough feelings between them.

1056
01:42:26,937 --> 01:42:34,961
So to protect your contract
interests without differentiating

1057
01:42:34,962 --> 01:42:41,899
I've never known a woman with
more character than your mother

1058
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:58,065
My sincerest condolences.

1059
01:42:58,066 --> 01:43:07,323
Are you okay?

1060
01:43:07,324 --> 01:43:27,742
I'll see you at home, okay?

1061
01:43:27,743 --> 01:43:28,725
"My dear Jessica..."

1062
01:43:28,726 --> 01:43:30,744
"My dear Jessica...

1063
01:43:30,745 --> 01:43:34,748
I know this can not erase the past,
but you can protect your future.

1064
01:43:34,749 --> 01:43:39,769
When your father signed his assets
I decided to redo my last will.

1065
01:43:39,770 --> 01:43:42,353
for my three children were equal

1066
01:43:42,354 --> 01:43:48,826
sharing the future as
true brothers

1067
01:43:48,827 --> 01:43:58,367
So what I could do in life,
Now what do I protect.

1068
01:43:58,368 --> 01:44:01,421
Just know
I am with you. "

1069
01:44:01,422 --> 01:44:32,965
"I love you...
mama ".

1070
01:44:32,966 --> 01:44:41,123
Oh, my god.

1071
01:44:41,124 --> 01:44:48,629
Excuse me.

1072
01:44:48,630 --> 01:44:53,132
Excuse me.
Ms. Scofield?

1073
01:44:53,133 --> 01:44:54,634
Are you the artist right?

1074
01:44:54,635 --> 01:44:56,419
Hello.

1075
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:59,638
If.

1076
01:44:59,639 --> 01:45:01,392
Did you know?

1077
01:45:01,393 --> 01:45:03,545
No...

1078
01:45:03,546 --> 01:45:12,384
But you know my mother.

1079
01:45:12,385 --> 01:45:14,936
And...

1080
01:45:14,937 --> 01:45:17,521
I want to know

1081
01:45:17,522 --> 01:45:23,444
I want to know my mother.

1082
01:45:23,445 --> 01:45:26,395
Okay.

1083
01:45:26,396 --> 01:45:30,748
Look, I feel like I want
chiaroscuro know their way

1084
01:45:30,749 --> 01:45:40,826
To know who ultimately became

1085
01:45:40,827 --> 01:45:42,629
and now Miss Scofield
in the center

1086
01:45:42,630 --> 01:45:47,899
What would you like to know?

1087
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:49,101
Une petit mort.
