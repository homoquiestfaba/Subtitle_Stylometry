1
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,137
Guys.

2
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,002
I'm gonna pass out cookies
in a minute, but first...

3
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,272
I need you to fill out
these test cards.

4
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,313
I want you to rate the features
you like best.

5
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,474
You know,
sound, weapons, game play.

6
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,815
And then in your own words,
just tell us what you think of the game.

7
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,184
It sucked big time!

8
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,951
And the monster looked like
a Sesame Street reject.

9
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,825
- It was not scary.
- That blows.

10
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,521
- So lame!
- Boring.

11
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:42,431
This game is supposed to be scary.
That's why we called it "EVIL-UTION".

12
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,299
"We'll show you the face of evil--

13
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,567
Where death is the only escape."

14
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:52,770
"Be afraid"?
Do these kids look afraid?

15
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,311
- You guys are so canned.
- What?

16
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,185
But who's gonna finish the game?

17
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,824
Well, starting over
isn't gonna be easy, Miss Clayton.

18
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,190
But let's remember what this
is all about-- 7.4 billion.

19
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,287
That's right-- $7.4 billion.

20
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,493
That's what the video game industry
netted in profits last year alone.

21
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,695
These games are like crack to kids,
only legal.

22
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,574
You know that.
But do you know how to hook 'em?

23
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,735
How to separate them
from their $7.4 billion?

24
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,371
You scare them.

25
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:33,250
Yeah, Hardcore's my real name.
I had it legally changed a year ago.

26
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,310
I wanted Diablo,
but it was already taken.

27
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:41,820
I plan to reapply for it
when the other Diablo...

28
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,293
passes on.

29
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,886
Today's kids have seen it all.

30
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,831
So if you want to scare them,
you gotta be, like, out there.

31
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,336
Like, crazy.
Like these guys.

32
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,271
I started at Joystick Graphics when I
was 12, but before that I was at Asari.

33
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:58,172
We were responsible for "Star Rumblers."
I developed the sound effects driver...

34
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,233
for that game when I was eight,
along with "Lunar Loons."

35
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,578
But I had to get out of that company
on account of-- I don't really know why.

36
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:08,211
People say I'm annoying, but when it
comes to crunch time they always call.

37
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,084
It's like, "Bug, can you do this?
Bug, can you do that?"

38
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,953
They never call Bug when it's time for,
like, say a company picnic.

39
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,926
No, they never extend
an invitation for old Gordo.

40
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,292
Gordon, which is my real name,
but you can call me Bug.

41
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,551
Everyone calls me Bug,
although I really don't know why.

42
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,895
But I have a few theories.

43
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,235
Back in 1985, I set up my first bug
collection. I took a magnifying glass--

44
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,798
Now, I know.
I know these guys seem difficult.

45
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,208
I know they seem unconventional.
The thing is...

46
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:37,237
you can't expect some ordinary,
boring dweeb to program you scary.

47
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,807
No way. They don't know scary.
These guys do.

48
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,449
The name is Sol.

49
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,652
As in Solomon.
As in "the king that is wise".

50
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,820
As in "the solution
to all your problems."

51
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,763
Why should you hire me? Why?

52
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,800
That's just dumb.
That is a dumb question.

53
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,961
Why do they call that a chair?
Why is the sky blue?

54
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,494
Why are you dressed like a 32-year-old
when it's obvious you're at least 56?

55
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:05,532
This game will kick ass,
because these guys are kick-ass.

56
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,637
They will give this game muscle,
insanity, attitude.

57
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,182
I don't blame you
for being scared of these freaks.

58
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:12,774
I am.

59
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,911
But that's what makes them
perfect for this game.

60
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,131
So, guys, what do you think?

61
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,641
It's a dump.

62
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,939
I love dumps.

63
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,316
Hi, everyone.

64
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,690
- Welcome.
- Who are you?

65
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,559
Laura Wheeler.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

66
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,564
What game engine you responsible for?

67
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,067
I'm not.
I'm just the intern.

68
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,502
You know, I make copies
and feed the fish.

69
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,972
Clean up. Cookie?

70
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,636
Shit, you're a spy.
You're here to steal our work.

71
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,679
- I'm the intern.
- Sure you are.

72
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,544
Who sent you? Microsync?
Compu-Rom? Who you work for?

73
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:21,142
These are all chocolate chip. You have
any plain oatmeal? I'm allergic.

74
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,153
Careful. You don't know
what she put in those.

75
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,883
They're cookies, not hemlock,
you paranoid sociopath.

76
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,085
Kids? The game?

77
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,389
Oh, yeah, the game.
Where's it at?

78
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,524
It's there, but the other programmers
actually locked us out.

79
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,058
- I tried to call, but they couldn't-
- Guys.

80
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,402
You heard the man.
Let's work.

81
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,904
All right.
Let's go, let's go!

82
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,269
Guys, I'm just tryin'
to impress the intern.

83
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,404
Why?

84
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,279
We're in. Game on.

85
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:29,141
I thought we were working on a game
and not a piece of shit.

86
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:32,555
I thought we were working on a game
and not a piece of shit.

87
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,751
What congenital imbecile
hired these quasi-coders?

88
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:39,058
This is weak. There's no plug-in
for virtu-goggles, cyber-gloves.

89
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,998
- This is grim.
- But can you make it scary?

90
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,501
That is why I hired you.

91
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,470
Guys, you remember Faye Clayton,
the money.

92
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,170
Lady, scary's what we do.

93
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,336
- Good. You have four weeks.
- What?

94
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,845
Four weeks?

95
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,848
I think I speak for everyone
when I say "no fuckin' way".

96
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,976
That's not enough time to even
develop the architecture...

97
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,021
much less the plug-ins
for the 3-D sound.

98
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,488
I thought these guys were good.

99
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,357
Well, they are good. They already
hacked into the system and--

100
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,861
I know you guys are bad...

101
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,363
but I'm not sure
you're real bright...

102
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,798
so I'm going to make
this pep talk real simple.

103
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,496
Three things you need to know.
Number one: Time. We don't have any.

104
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,099
Production starts in one month and we
don't have a monster, much less a game.

105
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:27,043
Now, that's scary.
This here isn't!

106
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,944
So forget the plug-ins.
Forget the sound.

107
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,506
Fix the monster,
and fix it quickly.

108
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,915
This is ridiculous.

109
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:37,386
- Do you know how long this takes?
- This isn't gonna work like this.

110
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,516
- We need a little more time, okay?
- Number two: trust.

111
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,823
No telling what the competition
might do. Spies are everywhere...

112
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,124
which is why we have security.

113
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:49,065
There will be cameras
recording everything you do.

114
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:53,662
Each door is fully alarmed. So if you
were even thinking a nasty thought--

115
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,979
Total lockdown.
Nobody gets in or out.

116
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,910
I don't need this. Last I checked,
the 13th amendment abolished slavery.

117
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,816
Forget the sound?
That's crazy.

118
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,752
We're programmers,
not miracle workers.

119
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,188
Number three: A task group
will rate your work...

120
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,988
and based on the feature they like
the best, there will be a bonus...

121
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,360
of$1 million.

122
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,038
That's right-- $1 million.

123
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,939
Whoever makes the monster scary
gets $1 million.

124
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,206
Share it. Don't share it.
Give the little guy less. I don't care.

125
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:37,714
- I just want results.
- Oh. God.

126
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,774
You've got four weeks
to get it right, people.

127
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,480
Four weeks to make me a monster.

128
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,017
I'm back.

129
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,597
I've got supplies.

130
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,119
You hungry?

131
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,491
Fresh meat.

132
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:34,937
You shouldn't fuck with other
people's stuff, spy, especially mine.

133
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,837
I just wanted to feed the fish.

134
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,401
Like it?
It's called the "soul claw".

135
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,309
Goes in clean...

136
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,484
comes out messy.

137
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:49,949
Scary.

138
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,955
Scary is as scary does.

139
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:59,286
Which is why the bonus is all mine.

140
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,364
Why do you waste time
with those damn things?

141
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,100
'Cause you can't just let 'em die.

142
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:13,304
Sure you can. If you wanna make it
in this world, you gotta be PFD--

143
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:21,152
Programmed For Damage.

144
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,824
I got you some mouthwash...

145
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:34,296
and deodorant.

146
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,834
Please use them.

147
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,223
God! What is with you guys?

148
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,230
Can't you enter rooms
like normal people?

149
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,130
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

150
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,259
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.

151
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,430
Laura, actually,
I was gonna ask you a question.

152
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,841
- And if you say no, I can--
- Hang on a second.

153
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:24,041
I got you something. Acne Buster.
Extra-extra-strength.

154
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,119
What'd you wanna ask me?

155
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,280
Stupid. Stupid!

156
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,602
Are you in here?

157
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,549
Your childish antics...

158
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,117
will not slow me down, Bug,
you pimple-dicked runt!

159
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,164
It wasn't me!

160
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,600
A '78 Chateau Neuf.

161
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,811
Did Hardcore put you up to this?

162
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,575
Can't I just bring you something
every once in awhile?

163
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,309
Don't ever play me, intern.

164
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,522
I need your technical expertise.

165
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,353
Of course-- you do.

166
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:44,190
Impressive.
Most impressive.

167
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,532
- Did you steal this from Daddy's cellar?
- Something like that.

168
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,503
Anyway, if I wanna deliver nine gigs
across a T-3 line...

169
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,639
what's the best way to compress
and encrypt the data?

170
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,969
Big question for an intern.

171
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,476
Well. hopefully I won't be
an intern forever.

172
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:05,209
I have this idea for a .com, and I'm
hoping that after EVIL-UTION is done--

173
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,292
- What is that?
- I ran a search on the word "monster".

174
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:20,229
There's a lot
of heinous shit out there...

175
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,062
and all of it's going on
my million-dollar AI engine.

176
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,528
The test kids aren't gonna
use words like "AI engine".

177
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,166
But they will use words like
"challenging", "exciting", "kick-ass".

178
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,210
They're gonna know this ain't
no Crackerjack game...

179
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,836
you can just memorize
a bunch of keystrokes to win.

180
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:38,348
This game is gonna help you think.
It's gonna learn as you play.

181
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,816
No game will ever be the same.
No game will ever be dull.

182
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,410
And your AI engine
is gonna give EVIL-UTION a brain?

183
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:46,650
No, better.
It'll give the game personality.

184
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,420
See, a game is only
as good as its programming...

185
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,431
Which is a direct reflection
of its programmer.

186
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,161
It's a whole zen-flow,
marriage-of-the-soul kind of thing.

187
00:15:57,223 --> 00:16:00,761
And if you input all of this
into my objet d'art, it's--

188
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:03,273
You'll get one psycho monster.

189
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,036
One brilliant psycho monster.

190
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:08,169
That's it.
Give me skin on that. baby.

191
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:13,247
What? You think those meat puppets
are doing better work?

192
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,412
You think I should be concerned
with Bug's lame-ass musical sec-re?

193
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,286
Well, Hardcore does have
some pretty intense stuff.

194
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,621
He does? Really?
Intense?

195
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,627
That's funny.
I don't see a thing.

196
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:24,627
Goddamn it!

197
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,926
Fuckin' machines!

198
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,594
That's kind of unfair,
don't you think?

199
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,733
Well, you have to be mean...

200
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,741
to make the green.

201
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:42,711
Fa ye, please.

202
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,305
The bonus is not helping,
it's hurting.

203
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,977
These guys are overloading the system
trying to outdo each other.

204
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,288
Yeah, Faye,
I know it's your money...

205
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,290
but we can't afford
another overload.

206
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,327
I can't-
I am being professional!

207
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,922
Listen, these guys are pushing
everything to the max.

208
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,332
If we don't get some more hardware,
the whole system is gonna--

209
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,392
Hello? Hello?

210
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,297
Goddamn it!

211
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,805
Sol, we crashed again.

212
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,812
You figured that out, huh?
Impressive.

213
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,212
Just fix it, will you?
Back up the game...

214
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:21,343
reset the phones,
and do something about these overloads.

215
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,546
Yes, sir.
I'll gut right on it.

216
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,928
Laura, what are you doing?

217
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,831
Well, I've been working
on this idea that I have.

218
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,840
And actually, I was hoping that maybe
after EVIL-UTION was finished--

219
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,504
What are you doing here?

220
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,342
I'm sorry.
I'll get out of your way.

221
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,350
That's not what I meant.

222
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,419
Look.

223
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,182
Young attractive girls like you...

224
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,555
do not hang out with
grubby, desperate geeks like us.

225
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:05,061
Not by choice.
I'm serious.

226
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,154
Now, you should be out there
living it up...

227
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,558
looking for your Mr. Big.

228
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,963
You know, a friend of mine tried that.

229
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,529
She found her Mr. Big,
or so she thought...

230
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,974
until his trust fund ran out.

231
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,705
Still, she's gotta be
having more fun than this.

232
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,304
I'm sure it was a blast
for a while...

233
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,782
until Mr. Big suddenly became
this asshole stalker...

234
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,910
and graduated to
Mr. Get-Your-Hands-Off-Me.

235
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,682
So...

236
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,746
I think I'll take my chances
with the geeks.

237
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,225
Well, the geeks are flattered.

238
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,856
So, what's your idea?

239
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,923
- Now?
- Yeah.

240
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,367
Really? Okay.

241
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,168
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- Bring it on!

242
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,335
I'll kill you, you little twerp!

243
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,902
Not again.

244
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,676
You pussy
You fight like a lesbian biker bitch!

245
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,217
That's funny. You look like one.

246
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:06,715
Goddamn it, guys!
What the fuck is going on?

247
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,355
We don't have time for this.

248
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,456
You told me to fix the overload problem,
right? Well, here it is.

249
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:19,560
This pig rewired everything so he could
gorge the mainframe with his crap.

250
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,401
Hey, this crap can filet
your know-it-all little ass.

251
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,600
Maybe, but it won't get you
any closer to my bonus!

252
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,610
- That'll be the day!
- Get out of my face!

253
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,612
Stop it!
Stop it!

254
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,945
Stop trying to kill each other,
and start working on the game.

255
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,950
- I am working on the game.
- No, you're not.

256
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,748
You're working on that bonus.
I mean, Jesus!

257
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,755
You guys are stupid.
Do you know that?

258
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:43,260
You think all this
is worth a million dollars?

259
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,454
Well, it isn't.
It's worth more.

260
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,829
A lot more, and Faye knows that.

261
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,459
Only it's not gonna be worth shit
if we don't finish.

262
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:55,438
Now, I know you guys
don't like each other very much.

263
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,906
Hell, I don't like you.

264
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,773
But if this game does well,
we all do well.

265
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,779
There'll be bonuses for everybody...

266
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,314
and then we will never have
to see each other again.

267
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,817
But first,
we have to finish the game!

268
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:12,754
So please, don't overload the system
and don't fight.

269
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:16,419
- Okay?
- You got it, boss.

270
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,032
Why don't they just share the bonus?

271
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,140
You'll learn, intern.

272
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,767
You'll learn.

273
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,739
I'm a really big fan, Julie--
Miss Strain.

274
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:42,411
Your work in Heavy Metal 2000
to El Chupacabra...

275
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,614
the way that you handle a--

276
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,816
A sword is just a perfect blend...

277
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,758
of brawn and beauty that we need
for our game heroine.

278
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,963
My agent said
this was an acting gig...

279
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,363
and I only drive in the rain
for acting gigs.

280
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,369
This is. In fact, these games
require a lot of acting.

281
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,463
But in our line of business,
we call it a "motion capture."

282
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:04,565
So, where's the camera?

283
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,736
Actually. we'll be using
an Apex 1600 telemetry suit.

284
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,802
It's real next-generation type stuff.

285
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,042
It's got shape memory alloys
and everything.

286
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,244
A group of electronic impulse sensors
linked with a computer digital model...

287
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,718
records your every muscle movements--

288
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,653
So, where's the crew?

289
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,518
Get off.

290
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,798
Here's your wardrobe, honey.

291
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:31,699
- You're kidding, right?
- You're right. We don't need these.

292
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,566
My agent said no nudity.

293
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,498
Miss Julie, we need to scan you.

294
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,511
And in order to get
the best digital transfer...

295
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,673
it's essential to keep all
analog interference to a minimum.

296
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:49,083
Which means no jewelry,
no shoes and no clothes.

297
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,553
Hey, we just wanna get all of you
in the computer, honey.

298
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:56,291
You boys want to see the big guns,
we renegotiate.

299
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,921
I want options.
Don't play dumb with me.

300
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:04,092
I know these games are big business,
so I want in on the IPO...

301
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,228
I want preferred stock, and none of this
crap that you dump on the pension funds.

302
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,103
And I want it in writing.

303
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,735
- Not a problem.
- It's all good.

304
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,143
Great. Who's scanning me?

305
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,055
Okay, honey, strip.

306
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,464
Untie me, damn it!
Untie me!

307
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,669
This is unfair!

308
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:45,368
This is so unfair!
You guys suck!

309
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:48,640
I brought her in. I should at least
get to play with her too.

310
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,578
Shut up, Bug.

311
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,775
Oh, fine. Yeah, fine.
I see how it is.

312
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,648
You guys are just jealous because my
game module's the best. Well, go ahead.

313
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,348
Have your little fun. Then let's see
who gets a chance at the bonus now.

314
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,356
Give it up, little man.

315
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,414
This game's as scary as white rice
without my Al engine.

316
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:06,554
But without my weapons, what are you
gonna do-- think someone to death?

317
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,292
Without my sound...

318
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,925
all you guys have
are a bunch of mimes on crack.

319
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,936
Shut up, Bug.

320
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,981
So, where's my mark?

321
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:33,455
Anywhere you'd like. The remotes
in the suit are fully charged.

322
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,218
Hey, is this thing safe?

323
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:39,559
- Absolutely.
- A hundred percent.

324
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,791
All right. then,
what do you want me to do?

325
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:45,199
- Jump.
- What?

326
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:49,228
Jump. You know, up and down,
sol can calibrate the system.

327
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,716
Okay, my turn.

328
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:49,399
Come on.
What's going on here?

329
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,401
- What now?
- No problems.

330
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:53,528
It's all under control.

331
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,340
What you doin' later, honey?
Because you've got a nice--

332
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,342
I said hands off, creep!

333
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,742
- That's it. I'm out of here.
- No, don't go.

334
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,439
Shit. I think we lost everything.

335
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:33,102
It serves you right for tying me up.
Now, we have to do her all over again.

336
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,236
Yeah. Do her again.

337
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,109
Guys, give me a status report.

338
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:40,639
- I'm down, Captain. My hands are tied.
- Mine too.

339
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,344
- Sol.
- I'm working on it.

340
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:45,048
- Well, what? wrong with it?
- Looks like the power surge...

341
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,283
fried out most of the IC chips
on the motherboard.

342
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,484
In English.

343
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,322
We're down.
Total system overload.

344
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,362
Shit! I'm on my way.

345
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,295
Anything I can do to help?

346
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,839
Yeah. Pray.

347
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,967
I told that idiot not to overload.

348
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:11,105
Listen. can I just remind you
we're days away from test group?

349
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,309
If we have to start over,
we're fucked.

350
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:17,320
Thanks. That's just the Kind of Kick
I need to motivate my black lazy ass.

351
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,593
So what are we supposed to do
if the system's down?

352
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:26,061
- I don't know.
- You could help me clean.

353
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,499
- Maybe we can get out of here.
- Yeah.

354
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,836
This place is starting to smell.

355
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,103
Well, the good news is,
the mainframes fine.

356
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,579
- Well, thank God.
- But the code's corrupted.

357
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,082
- We lost everything.
- Goddamn it!

358
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:50,348
But I finished the backup.

359
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,411
All our work is right here.

360
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:55,152
- How long to load it all in?
- Well, we got a lot of stuff here.

361
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:58,195
- Probably gonna take all night.
- That sounds like a one-man job to me.

362
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,196
Yeah. Sol can handle it.

363
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:03,756
Like hell.
I'm no data-entry clown.

364
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,200
Come on. I'll do it.
You guys get out of here.

365
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:09,034
- Just tell me what I need to do.
- Well, it's simple.

366
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,040
All you have to do is
defrag the hard drives...

367
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,576
and run a batch relink
on the media files.

368
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,676
That was in English.

369
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,631
You know, for someone who's on
his third software company...

370
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,084
your technical skills
are sorely lacking.

371
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,019
Remind us again why you're the boss.

372
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:27,887
You're supposed to be Mr. King Business.
What are you doing in this dump?

373
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,927
- Yeah, why are you the boss?
- Because I get you guys the big scores.

374
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,793
Oh, yeah. And that's what happened
with the Wild Tangent gig?

375
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:37,595
- And the Compu-Rom debacle.
- And now this-- the big score.

376
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,602
You guys think you could
do better on your own?

377
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:43,037
You're welcome to try. Charming
personalities like yourselves...

378
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:45,335
should have no problem getting work
at the Burger Palace.

379
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,906
All right, then.
Who stays?

380
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,573
I'm okay.

381
00:27:57,376 --> 00:28:00,914
How about Laura? I could stay behind
and help her get started.

382
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,050
- Yeah, give it to the intern.
- Leave her alone.

383
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:05,891
- Don't you think she's done enough?
- She's the intern.

384
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,488
Okay. We'll draw straws.

385
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:10,830
Yeah, that's easy
for the tech retard to say.

386
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,835
I mean, you're useless.
You don't have to draw.

387
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,303
Yeah, draw straws.
How pre-military industrial complex.

388
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,601
You guys have a better idea?

389
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,169
Hey, guys.
What's goin' on?

390
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,425
Okay, game's not fully finished...

391
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,967
textures aren't rendered,
and this is still a rough draft.

392
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,162
But tournament mode does work...

393
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:51,606
so the first person to lose all their
lives stays the night-- no excuses.

394
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,143
Oh, yeah. You boys
are ripe for the pickin'.

395
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,701
Game on!

396
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,213
- Here come the pain.
- Which one moves backwards?

397
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,719
EVIL-UTION.

398
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,886
In the great eruption of Mt. Edo...

399
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:14,453
a break in the earth
opened the gate way to hell

400
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,160
For thousands of years,
we have held back the demons below.

401
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,933
Now, the forces of evil
have a powerful new overlord.

402
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:25,703
He has overrun our defenses.

403
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,450
You are the last hope.

404
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:37,282
You must destroy the overlord.

405
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,583
Stop the EVIL-UTION.

406
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:42,251
Kill or be killed!

407
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,522
- All right, here we go.
- Here we go, boys.

408
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,530
Let's do this. Yes!

409
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,230
Come on, man!

410
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,563
You suck, you guys.
I'm on top of this.

411
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,336
I'm dominating the world.

412
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,845
Time out.
Defective controller.

413
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:11,284
Come on, baby.
Let's-- Come on. Come on.

414
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:15,155
Motherfucker! Which one
of you crackers disconnected me?

415
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,250
Come on, now!
I demand satisfaction.

416
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,624
- It wasn't me.
- It was Bug.

417
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:19,958
I just said it wasn't me.

418
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,589
- You did this!
- I didn't do it!

419
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,260
Give me mine back!
Give me back mine!

420
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,067
Oh, come on.
This sucks!

421
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,871
Shit! I'm out.

422
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,415
I taught it that.

423
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:42,748
- Get ready to be taught.
- Come on, guys. No fighting.

424
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,516
This is not about fighting.
This is a killing.

425
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,730
Go, Laura.

426
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:03,602
Girl got game.

427
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:05,505
Ms. Pac-Man champion
three years in a row.

428
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,669
We're a long way
from Pac-Man, little girl.

429
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,838
Ten bucks says Miss Pac Man
kicks your ass.

430
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,472
Shit, Drummond. Ten bucks?
Why don't you make it hurt?

431
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,676
Actually, I got 50 on the intern.

432
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,448
I got two hundred and twenty-six.

433
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:22,625
- No way you win. No way.
- Come on, Laura.

434
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:26,094
Come on, Laura.
Kick his ass!

435
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,162
You know why Pac Man
was so popular?

436
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,172
It was a whole metaphor for the '80s.
It's like all the power and greed.

437
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,435
You know, gobble up as much as you can
as fast as you can.

438
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:40,443
Hostile takeovers, leverage buyouts.
Oh, look.

439
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,445
- There's a power pellet.
- Shut up, Bug!

440
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,818
Not fair! I couldn't nuke 'em.
The fuckin' sword blasters don't work.

441
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:53,652
Yeah, they don't.
That's just too bad.

442
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:55,817
Loser.

443
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:58,225
- Beginner's luck, intern. That's all.
- Shut up, shut up.

444
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,853
She's still in it.

445
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:08,566
You need some more life points.
Grab some of that armor.

446
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,080
Oh, my God.

447
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,082
That is scary.

448
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:25,151
Not bad, guys.
Still a lot of work to do.

449
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,850
Not bad.

450
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,931
Sol, you make those fixes
to the game tonight?

451
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,932
Got 'em right here.

452
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:44,332
- With or without the Al chip?
- With.

453
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:47,240
- And you'll back up the changes?
- Yes, of course.

454
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,382
What?

455
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,941
- You need anything?
- Yeah.

456
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:59,420
- A night away from you losers.
- You got it.

457
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,754
I'm goin' out
and gettin' piss-drunk.

458
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,692
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm gonna get me
a girl and two tubs of Cool Whip.

459
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,854
- Cool Whip?
- I'm lactose intolerant.

460
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,493
Don't worry, guys.
I'll be back.

461
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,950
"The computer. It's more
than just a box of wires.

462
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,959
It's an extension
of our own humanity...

463
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,017
only a thousand times more powerful.

464
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:41,894
If you believe that the computer
can expand our abilities...

465
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:46,060
then why not expand upon our instinct
to care-- our capacity to give?

466
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:49,594
If we did that, we could make
every day like Christmas."

467
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:52,335
And that's the idea behind
secretsanta.com.

468
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,805
My God.
You hate it.

469
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,974
No, no. It's--

470
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:06,484
The thing is,
no one really cares about giving.

471
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,616
People are far more interested
in taking.

472
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:13,027
- That's a pretty dim view of things.
- Is it?

473
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,894
Think about it.
"Rook takes pawn."

474
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:18,867
"I'll take Park Place."
"Winner takes all."

475
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:21,530
Every game in the world
is judged by who can take the most.

476
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:24,096
- This isn't a game.
- Everything's a game, Laura.

477
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,143
You're either a winner
or you're a big fat loser.

478
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:30,771
So this job is what?
Like, just a giant game of Twister?

479
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,450
Yeah, right foot, green,
EVIL-UTION takes off.

480
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:39,512
Left hand, yellow, Faye sets us up
with first-run financing...

481
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,388
a place of our own,
business cards, the works.

482
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,654
We win if we deliver.

483
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:47,822
If we don't,
we spin a left foot. Red.

484
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,065
The game is gonna be great, Peter.
I mean, home run.

485
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,498
- And it couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
- Don't say that.

486
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,566
Nice is not a luxury
you can afford in this business.

487
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:03,306
Winners aren't nice.

488
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:05,314
You do not get your name
on the building by being nice.

489
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:08,840
Who are you kidding?
"Nice is not a luxury you can afford."

490
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:11,387
- Peter, you are a great guy.
- How do you know?

491
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,889
Maybe I'm not.

492
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,891
Maybe I'm a real pig fucker.

493
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,555
Yeah, right.

494
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,560
You gotta toughen up, Laura.

495
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,466
Life doesn't give you enough time
to be nice-- only efficient.

496
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,834
If you keep putting your trust
in things like "good" and "mercy"...

497
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,576
you're gonna lose every single time.

498
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,079
It's not much c-fa choice then. is it?

499
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:40,376
I mean, you either
become this monster...

500
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,748
or be a victim.

501
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:47,387
You'll learn, intern.

502
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,049
You'll learn.

503
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,468
All right, it's magic time.

504
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,371
Come on!

505
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,242
All right, all right, all right.

506
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:19,083
That's my million-dollar baby.

507
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,584
Oh, dang.
Come on, come on.

508
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,987
Come on, now.
Don't get uppity with me.

509
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,800
All right. Let's work.

510
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:40,234
Game's finishing itself.

511
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,505
But that's impossible, unless--

512
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,571
Oh, yeah. My Al chip.

513
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:50,514
Nothing artificial about your
intelligence. baby. Nothing at all.

514
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,886
Let's see what else you finished for me.
Let's do this.

515
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:55,982
Yeah, baby.

516
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,623
Hello?

517
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,885
Motherfucker!

518
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,118
Burn, baby, burn.

519
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,359
Hello?

520
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:50,369
I have got to get me some "me" time.

521
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:59,242
Where you at, bitch?

522
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:03,216
Impressive. Most--

523
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:08,849
Sol, what's with the mess
you left downstairs, man?

524
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,944
Bug, don't freak out.

525
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,894
Goddamn it, Bug!

526
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,564
What the hell's going on here?

527
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,861
- What happened to Sol?
- He's dead, Bug.

528
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,166
- Sol is dead.
- But how?

529
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:31,264
I don't know.
He was like that when I came in.

530
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:35,072
Who would've done this?
I mean, why?

531
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,477
And the back-up disc is missing.

532
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:42,151
Who do you think did this--
Microsync, Compu-Rom?

533
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:45,085
Does it matter? Pick one.
Fuck! Fuck!

534
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:47,817
We have to call the police.

535
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:51,224
Wait a minute. Hold on.
Let's just think about this.

536
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,625
Think about what?

537
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:55,096
You call the police,
they're gonna lock this place up.

538
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:59,158
Whoever stole that back-up disc can beat
us to the market with a copycat game.

539
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:03,696
Yeah, but Sol is dead.

540
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:07,809
And?

541
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:12,107
And he's-- Well, he--
You can't--

542
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,650
He's fucking dead. Hardcore! Jesus!

543
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,882
Of course.

544
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,981
Come on, Bug.

545
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,822
Are you happy
with your shitty little life?

546
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,987
Don't tell me you dress like that
because you choose to.

547
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,827
Shut up. You just don't want the police
to take you back to your little cage.

548
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,094
No, that's not it, man.
Let's face it.

549
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,729
The market's getting tougher.
The big scores are all but gone.

550
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:38,967
- This game's our last chance.
- What-- to see what prison's like?

551
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,032
Oh, please.
You already know.

552
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:44,273
What did you do with your big night off?
Go out with a couple of friends?

553
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,895
- Meet your future ex-wife?
- It's none of your goddamn business.

554
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:50,977
You did nothing, Bug. You went home
and fell asleep watching TV.

555
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,202
Shit, we might as well have
stayed here at work, right?

556
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,916
Failures the worst prison there is.

557
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,826
You eat alone, you sleep alone.

558
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,923
No one gives two shits about you.

559
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:06,059
No one.

560
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:08,070
Not even the interns.

561
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,572
But it doesn't have to be like that-
not anymore.

562
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:17,135
We can finish the game,
get EVIL-UTION out first and cash in.

563
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,606
But how do you explain that?

564
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:26,584
He couldn't take the pressure
and bailed out. Whatever.

565
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:29,181
All we need is a couple more days.

566
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,249
The backup disc is still missing.

567
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,262
The game's still playing
on the mainframe.

568
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,128
All I have to do
is add my sound module.

569
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,094
That's one less person
eligible for the bonus.

570
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:53,006
- What's wrong?
- How do I know you didn't kill him?

571
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,051
The same reason I know
you didn't kill him.

572
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,684
I'm gonna check the security cameras.

573
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,825
Hey, Laura, wait!

574
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:15,132
Can't have the intern beat me
to the office. I overslept.

575
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:18,606
Thank you for dinner last night.

576
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:20,665
Next time, I'll bring forks.

577
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,904
Good morning.
How you doin', bug?

578
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,472
- What's going on?
- I'm good.

579
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:28,915
Everything's good.
Everything's really good.

580
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,543
Are we back in business?

581
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,016
Good.

582
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:46,658
Get in there.
Goddamn it, Sol!

583
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,101
Good morning, Hardcore.

584
00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:52,031
Where's Sol?

585
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,736
Beats me.
I think he took off.

586
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,046
His car's still here.

587
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:03,611
Hey, wow! Brownies!

588
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,491
Thanks, Laura.

589
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:14,958
Hey. What's wrong with him?

590
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:21,501
Nosy little bitch.

591
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:24,233
Oh, God!

592
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,735
Ah, shit!

593
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:33,181
- What's up, boss?
- Have you seen Sol?

594
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,547
- I need the backup disc.
- Hey, don't worry about it.

595
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,552
I'll take care of it for you.

596
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,623
But stay away from the mainframe.
Last thing I need...

597
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,091
is some Ivy League know-nothing
fucking with my shit.

598
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,823
Fine, just get it done.

599
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,831
Yeah, get out of here.

600
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:16,716
Some boyfriend.

601
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:48,318
No. Shit.

602
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,861
Goddamn it!

603
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:34,228
God, Bug!
What are you doing?

604
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,397
I'm finishing up
the monster's voice.

605
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,167
In the bathroom?

606
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:40,004
The acoustics are better in here.

607
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:42,908
Ready to die?

608
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:48,250
Sure, Bug. Whatever.

609
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,308
Laura, why--
What's wrong?

610
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,320
I just need to make a phone call.

611
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,652
Do you know how
to reset the phones?

612
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:57,625
Did you try
Drummond's cellular phone?

613
00:46:57,682 --> 00:46:59,753
Not yet. I will.
Thank you.

614
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,764
- Sure.
- In a minute.

615
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,630
Goddamn it! Shit!

616
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,400
It's gonna be one of those days.

617
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:16,143
Laura, I can clean it up.
I can do it.

618
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:19,640
It's fine.
It's fine, Bug.

619
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:21,308
I got it.

620
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:30,951
Come on.

621
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,230
Son of a bitch.
Bullshit, they're deleted.

622
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,503
Yes! Gotcha.

623
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:44,301
Okay, let's see
who's fuckin' with us.

624
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,172
What the fuck?

625
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:05,458
Son of a--

626
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:07,996
Come on, Jeremy, pick up.

627
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:15,330
- Sol and Hardcore are at it again.
- What?

628
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,712
Hardcore, did you move Sol?
Because I can't find him--

629
00:48:31,142 --> 00:48:33,622
Bug, listen.

630
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,623
There's something freaky
goin' on here, man.

631
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:46,235
I knew it. I knew you killed Sol!
I knew you killed Sol!

632
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,861
It was the telemetry suit.
The suit did it!

633
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,872
Just check the security camera.

634
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,568
- Don't take another step closer.
- Bug, shut up and listen!

635
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:57,078
I know it sounds crazy,
but the suit's alive, man.

636
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:01,048
It killed Sol,
and it tried to kill me.

637
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,813
- Please don't come any closer!
- Bug, shut up and listen!

638
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:07,321
I'm tellin' ya,
I didn't touch Sol.

639
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:08,982
It was the suit.

640
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:14,855
- Shit! Where is it?
- Help! Somebody, help!

641
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:16,557
- What is it?
- He killed Sol!

642
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,362
- Where is it?
- Guys, what--

643
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:22,199
- He killed Sol! Look!
- Sol's dead?

644
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:29,010
It wasn't me. It was the suit.
It was the goddamn suit.

645
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,068
Okay, okay.
Listen, big guy--

646
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,183
Leave. Everybody out.

647
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,594
Okay, Hardcore,
let's talk about this.

648
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,258
Okay? All right?
Come on, man.

649
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,268
Leave now!

650
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:56,100
Okay. All right.
I'm leaving.

651
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:07,715
Come on. Where are you?

652
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,283
Shit!

653
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,950
You want Hardcore?
Come and get some!

654
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:22,053
Let's get it on!

655
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,966
I knew something was up
when Hardcore didn't want me--

656
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:33,736
Sol's dead, and you knew?
We have to call the police.

657
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,777
Give me the cell phone.
I'll 9-1-1 his ass right now.

658
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,779
Call him.

659
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:38,905
Oh, shit!

660
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:43,683
Help me!
Help me, please!

661
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:46,582
- Oh, shit!
- Open up!

662
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:56,831
Oh, Jesus!

663
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,958
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

664
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:00,627
Oh, God!

665
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,432
Lines are all dead.

666
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:11,705
This is not good.

667
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:15,342
- What the hell's goin' on?
- I don't know. But best guess?

668
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,441
Yes!

669
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:18,851
As near as I can tell, it happened
yesterday with the power surge.

670
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,186
The storm must've nailed a transformer,
causing a surge of such magnitude...

671
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:24,192
that it overloaded the entire system.

672
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,728
Which normally isn't that bad,
but with Hardcore rewiring the system...

673
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:29,287
and God only knows what Sol
was doing with the AI chip...

674
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:31,663
the combination must have had
a devastating effect on the mainframe...

675
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:33,668
causing a complete in verse of code.

676
00:51:35,626 --> 00:51:37,230
That's just a guess.

677
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:41,970
You know how
the telemetry suit works?

678
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,739
The suit moves,
the computer records it.

679
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:45,747
The suit is linked to
a digital model in the computer.

680
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:48,443
Whoever controls the suit
controls the model.

681
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,815
Somehow during the surge,
everything got reversed.

682
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:54,185
What's goin' on?
You guys stop this!

683
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:55,985
So the computer's
controlling the suit?

684
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,390
And the computer's
playing the game.

685
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,395
Houston, we have a problem.

686
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,407
Wait, wait. Stop.

687
00:53:21,465 --> 00:53:24,844
Hardcore and Sol are dead
because this thing is playing a game?

688
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:26,438
Our game. EVIL-UTION.

689
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:29,109
"Kill or be killed.
Where death is the only escape."

690
00:53:29,173 --> 00:53:32,780
Can't you just stop the game?

691
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:40,059
I can't. It won't let me
into the system.

692
00:53:40,117 --> 00:53:42,825
Well, then can't you shut
the system down or just turn it off?

693
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,423
- Good idea. Let's do it.
- We can't!

694
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:48,333
Why not?
In English, Bug.

695
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:51,634
The backup disc is missing.

696
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:54,539
- Bug, who cares?
- The backup disc is the only copy...

697
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,544
of the game that we have
outside the mainframe.

698
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,342
We shut down the mainframe, we could
lose all the data, all the programming.

699
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,940
Well, can't we run
one of our utility programs...

700
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,144
and recover our work?

701
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:06,449
Well, even so, you can--
You can rebuild the game, right?

702
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:09,150
I can recreate the music.

703
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:12,725
And the sound effects.

704
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:14,785
What about the Al engine?

705
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:16,661
- That was Sol's.
- The weapons?

706
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,394
Jesus Christ. Didn't you guys
ever work on anything together?

707
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:25,697
- So we lose everything?
- Well, not everything.

708
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,573
- We'll still have our lives.
- Yeah.

709
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,203
Our miserable, pathetic,
poor lives.

710
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:37,476
God, you guys. What are we doing?
This game is not worth dying for.

711
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:44,389
Guys? Guys?
Come on, Bug.

712
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:47,395
Come on, Laura.
Look at me.

713
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:50,660
I'm not stupid. I know what people
think of me. I know what I am.

714
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:52,723
What are you talking about?

715
00:54:56,326 --> 00:55:00,001
They just haven't
spent time with you.

716
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,469
You have.

717
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:09,049
Tell me.
Would you kiss this face?

718
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,952
Be honest.

719
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,754
Maybe.

720
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:22,723
"Maybe."

721
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:25,062
Well, I'm tired of being a "maybe".

722
00:55:25,122 --> 00:55:27,728
I wanna be a "yes".

723
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,431
I need that bonus.
I need this game.

724
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:34,572
You really think that money's
gonna do all that?

725
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:36,907
Yeah, I do.

726
00:55:39,203 --> 00:55:40,978
Laura's right.

727
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:44,952
I'll go.
I'll shut it down.

728
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:48,481
No, I'll go.

729
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:50,991
At least I still might be able
to save some of the work.

730
00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:53,494
You go,
we'll lose everything for sure.

731
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:02,259
- Just a "maybe", huh?
- A definite "maybe".

732
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,650
Okay, come on!

733
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,782
Go, go, go!

734
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,403
All right.

735
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,483
- What? What?
- What's taking so long?

736
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,647
- I'm looking for the back-up disc
- What?

737
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:57,988
If that thing killed Sol,
and the back-up disc is missing...

738
00:56:58,048 --> 00:57:00,208
it's still playing the game;
it wouldn't take the disc.

739
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,161
But, fuck the disc! Shut it off!

740
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:22,950
Come on, come on.

741
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,816
Look, I'm trying to save
our livelihoods here.

742
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:27,514
All right?
This is a delicate piece of machinery.

743
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:30,683
You can't just flip on a switch
and walk away like some fucking light.

744
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:33,193
Fine, fine, just hurry it up.

745
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:44,063
All right,
the RAM board is connected to--

746
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,139
Guys?

747
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:58,818
The 3-D board is connected to the SCSI.
The SCSI is connected to the-- what?

748
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:03,655
- Hurrying.
- Good, 'cause it killed the camera.

749
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:07,062
What do you mean,
it killed the camera?

750
00:58:10,354 --> 00:58:12,698
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, man, oh, man.

751
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,903
The SCSI is connected to the what?

752
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,941
To the what?
To the red wire.

753
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:42,691
Red wire. Red wire.

754
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,628
Bug, are you all right?

755
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,812
Where is it?
Where's the monster now?

756
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:33,614
Don't shoot!

757
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:37,508
- Shut it off! Kill it!
- Jesus!

758
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:41,420
Red wire.
Goddamn it! God--

759
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,926
Come on, you son of a--

760
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:52,489
Shit!

761
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:02,975
Come on, come on.
God, give me something!

762
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:07,772
Come on! Okay.

763
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,418
Shit.

764
01:00:49,713 --> 01:00:50,817
Shit!

765
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:58,632
Shit.

766
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:04,139
- You okay?
- Yeah. Is it gone?

767
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:15,349
- It didn't work!
- No shit!

768
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:16,748
Can you kill it?

769
01:01:18,275 --> 01:01:20,118
All right.
What do we do now?

770
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:22,123
Get outta here!

771
01:01:23,547 --> 01:01:26,551
- Come on! Why's the door locked?
- Security system's fried.

772
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:28,892
- Well, override it!
- I'm trying!

773
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:32,764
Oh, come on!
Don't tell me I'm trapped in here!

774
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:34,859
Wait!
Where is that thing?

775
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,546
Laura, it's Jeremy.

776
01:01:47,604 --> 01:01:50,813
I know you're in there.
I can see your car. Hello?

777
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,114
Jeremy, I'm in here!

778
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:56,885
I need your help! Please!

779
01:01:56,947 --> 01:02:00,986
- In here! We're in here!
- Help! Help!

780
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:15,143
Jeremy, help us, please!
We're in here!

781
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:27,817
Come on, baby. Open the door.

782
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:31,290
Are you trying to punish me?

783
01:02:31,348 --> 01:02:34,921
Is that it?
Fine. Be that way

784
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:37,932
You know, I don't need
this shit, Laura!

785
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,703
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

786
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,919
Why don't you go fuck the freaks
while you're in there?

787
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:46,963
I know that's what you
fuckin' want to do, right?

788
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:52,804
Fuck!

789
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:57,510
Laura, you better fucking hide in there,
you fucking bitch!

790
01:02:57,574 --> 01:02:59,815
You fucking whore!
You fucking slut!

791
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,652
Fuck you! Fuck you!

792
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:04,714
Fuckin' stay in there
and die, bitch!

793
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:11,198
Fuck this.

794
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:36,852
Laura, it's okay. It's me.

795
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,567
- Okay. That hurts.
- Oh, my God.

796
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:49,535
Here.

797
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:53,170
Jesus, Laura.

798
01:03:57,434 --> 01:04:00,711
- It's nothing.
- Sorry.

799
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,547
Thanks.

800
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:08,919
Come on. We're gonna use
the air ducts to get outta here.

801
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,515
- What are you looking for?
- A way out.

802
01:04:15,485 --> 01:04:17,863
See, we didn't have time to build
the game levels from scratch.

803
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:20,128
So you used the building layout.

804
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,535
Okay, if we just follow
the air ducts--

805
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:27,700
What's that over there? Right above
the fire engine under Edo's point.

806
01:04:27,764 --> 01:04:30,768
That's it. That's how we
get outta here. Roof vent.

807
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:34,308
Oh, please.

808
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,318
Oh, come on.

809
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:41,049
This...

810
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:42,317
isn't...

811
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:43,983
happening.

812
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:02,943
I don't wanna die!

813
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:12,143
Fresh meat.

814
01:05:15,812 --> 01:05:17,758
Damn, that was scary.

815
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:21,323
Damn, I'm good.

816
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,197
Programmed for damage.

817
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,206
Yes, you are.

818
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:37,268
- Scary is as scary does.
- That was always my favorite.

819
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:39,904
Shut up, Bug.

820
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,662
- What?
- Careful. Spread out.

821
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:03,226
These panels can't hold
both of us.

822
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:10,006
Do you think
we're gonna make it?

823
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:13,172
Sure. Left foot, red.

824
01:06:13,236 --> 01:06:15,716
Just a tough spin,
but we'll finish the game, right?

825
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,422
That's not what I meant.

826
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:29,221
Bug, where are you?

827
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,711
Somebody help m--

828
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:18,612
Ready to die?

829
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,815
Maybe.

830
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,585
Definite maybe.

831
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,994
- What was that?
- I don't know.

832
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,424
- Get back! Get back!
- Oh, my God!

833
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:00,153
God, what was that?

834
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,466
Hold on. We're coming.

835
01:08:19,362 --> 01:08:22,639
- Oh, my God.
- Laura, careful.

836
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:25,137
Shit.

837
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,741
I'll check the front door.

838
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:30,543
Come on, damn it!
Open!

839
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:35,841
- Hardcore's Palm Pilot.
- What?

840
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:40,547
Hard-cores Palm Pilot has wireless
access. It's gotta be here somewhere.

841
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:44,854
Okay, you e-mail for help.
I'm gonna get this door open.

842
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:01,066
Gross.

843
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:06,041
I got it!

844
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,308
No, I don't.

845
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:08,709
It's controlled by the digital model,
and the model is playing the game.

846
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:11,268
- So, how do we get outta here?
- We beat the game.

847
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:14,576
- Okay, I'm in.
- This gonna work?

848
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:16,810
Yeah, if I can kill the monster.

849
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:20,218
- Think you can win?
- Gonna try.

850
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:23,553
- This isn't Ms. Pac-Man.
- Yeah, I know.

851
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,062
Kill or be killed

852
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,126
Damn.

853
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,971
- Game over.
- Goddamn it!

854
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:45,808
- What is it? What's wrong?
- It's learned all my moves.

855
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:48,849
- It's getting smarter.
- It can't do that. It's just a game.

856
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:50,748
It's not. It's everything.

857
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:54,721
It's Hardcore's intensity and Sol's
attitude, even Bug-- it's all in there:

858
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:57,314
all the fighting, all the greed.

859
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:59,724
All that shit is in there,
and it's gonna get us killed!

860
01:12:07,957 --> 01:12:09,231
Good.

861
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,662
I was wondering
when you'd learn.

862
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,238
Here.
Try it with these.

863
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:35,023
Ripe for the picking

864
01:12:35,785 --> 01:12:38,356
- What? What is it? What's wrong?
- It's here.

865
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:48,371
Where?

866
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:52,139
I could swear it was here.

867
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:57,211
It's only me.

868
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:05,218
Laura, I promise you,
if that thing gets near to you at all...

869
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:07,522
it's gonna have to
kill me first.

870
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:40,425
Where'd it go?

871
01:14:35,338 --> 01:14:37,409
Game on.

872
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,180
Shit.

873
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:46,090
Oh, shit.

874
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:29,865
Come on, where is it?
Where is it?

875
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,531
Come on, come on, come on!

876
01:15:32,595 --> 01:15:34,541
Shit.

877
01:15:34,597 --> 01:15:39,046
God, where is it?
Yes!

878
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:49,953
No shit!

879
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:13,471
Shit.

880
01:16:13,536 --> 01:16:15,243
The back-up disc was never missing.

881
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:17,341
You took it.

882
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:20,580
You're the spy. You were gonna
sell us out from the start.

883
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:23,919
Laura, thank God
you're all right.

884
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:27,155
Where is it?

885
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:39,606
How could you?

886
01:16:39,662 --> 01:16:42,609
Laura, put the gun down.
Trust me. I'm--

887
01:16:42,665 --> 01:16:44,542
Don't say that.

888
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:48,173
My boyfriend--

889
01:16:50,139 --> 01:16:52,847
My ex-boyfriend
used to say that.

890
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:55,354
Tell me why.

891
01:16:56,412 --> 01:16:57,720
Why?

892
01:17:00,049 --> 01:17:03,792
What answer do you want
to hear, Laura-- greed?

893
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:05,855
That's too simple...

894
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:08,697
even though Compu-Rom is
paying me a lot of money for this.

895
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:10,031
Ambition?

896
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:13,562
No, selling out your own company
never looks good.

897
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:16,269
Mom needs an operation.

898
01:17:16,332 --> 01:17:19,074
Wouldn't that be nice
if it were true?

899
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:24,608
See, I wish I could boil it down to one
convenient answer for you, intern...

900
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:28,177
but the thing is,
if you have to ask...

901
01:17:28,244 --> 01:17:30,588
then you really haven't
learned a damn thing, have you?

902
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:36,392
So don't ask me why.
Ask yourself: Why not?

903
01:17:36,452 --> 01:17:38,898
But what about
your deal with Faye--

904
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:41,434
The business cards,
your name on the building?

905
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,026
Who cares?

906
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:47,598
That Kind of thing may impress your
folks. but out in the real world...

907
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,200
money is the only way
they keep score, darling.

908
01:17:50,266 --> 01:17:53,247
Even if it means killing
Hardcore and Sol and Bug?

909
01:17:53,302 --> 01:17:58,513
Hold on. I didn't create that monster.
They did. You said it yourself--

910
01:17:58,574 --> 01:18:01,714
All that fighting, all that greed.

911
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:06,920
Put that into a computer and,
yeah, you get a real scary mess.

912
01:18:08,651 --> 01:18:11,632
- Just like the real world, right?
- That's right.

913
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:15,760
The real world is messy
because people are messy.

914
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:17,531
Now, maybe you're too naive
to believe that...

915
01:18:17,593 --> 01:18:19,470
or maybe-- you're just
too stupid to learn.

916
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:23,977
Either way, that fact separates us
into the haves and the have-hots.

917
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:27,139
It makes me a decision maker
and you a doormat.

918
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:29,581
It makes me a winner,
and you a lo--

919
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:38,453
You fucking bitch.

920
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,087
Oh, that's good, intern.

921
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:48,966
That's really good.
You're finally learning.

922
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:50,469
It's over for you.

923
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,972
Over? Oh, please.

924
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:56,974
I'll tell the jury
it was the pressure.

925
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:59,444
It was my childhood!
It was the game!

926
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:02,914
Because no one wants
to believe...

927
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:05,680
that we're capable
of such darkness all on our own...

928
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:10,789
that deep down inside
we're all monsters.

929
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:13,588
So it's not over.

930
01:19:13,649 --> 01:19:15,788
Not yet.

931
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:21,701
That's not what I meant.

932
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:30,938
Oh, shit.

933
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,616
Hey, pigfucker!

934
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,624
Game on.

935
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:18,524
Come get some.

936
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:53,286
You'll learn, intern.

937
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,286
You'll learn.

938
01:23:07,015 --> 01:23:08,961
- Yes! I rule!
- I beat it!

939
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:11,497
I told you I could beat you!
I beat you!

940
01:23:15,591 --> 01:23:17,832
I think we have a winner.

941
01:23:17,893 --> 01:23:21,272
I don't approve of the mess left behind,
but I can't argue with the results.

942
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:25,073
- Good job, Laura.
- And?

943
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:27,204
And thank you?

944
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:30,239
Three things.

945
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:32,808
One: the bonus.

946
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:34,877
The million-dollar bonus,
I believe.

947
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:36,422
But you're an intern.

948
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:38,617
Yeah, but you are happy
with the game.

949
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:43,561
Pity nobody could back up your story
that Drummond committed the murders.

950
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:46,190
Compu-Rom claims that
they've never heard of him.

951
01:23:46,255 --> 01:23:48,861
And there's no security footage.
Seems odd, don't you think?

952
01:23:48,924 --> 01:23:53,031
Two: Microsync releases
EVIL-NATOR this fall.

953
01:23:53,095 --> 01:23:56,872
I know the name sucks, but it is
remarkably similar to EVIL-UTION--

954
01:23:56,932 --> 01:23:58,969
AI engine, scary monster.

955
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,480
Practically identical, I hear.

956
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,539
Be a shame if they were
to beat us to market.

957
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:07,687
Not a chance. They're months behind us.
How could they Po-

958
01:24:07,743 --> 01:24:09,154
Three:

959
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:13,990
It's like you said-- you never know
what the competition might do.

960
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:19,155
Spies are everywhere.

961
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:41,915
Miss Wheeler,
the new intern's here.

962
01:24:41,977 --> 01:24:44,048
- Fine. Send her in.
- Okay.

963
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:50,920
It's not scary, it's shit.

964
01:24:50,986 --> 01:24:54,331
Yes, I'm looking at it
right now, and it's not scary.

965
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:59,471
You know, I don't want to hear this.
I just want you to fucking fix it.

966
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:05,976
I really appreciate you taking the time
to do this, Miss Wheeler.

967
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:07,604
Opportunities like this are rare.

968
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:09,512
- Even more so--
- Do you have a question?

969
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:14,316
Okay. Sure.

970
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:20,458
What's the most valuable lesson
you've learned in your career?

971
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:22,119
Stupid question. Next?

972
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:36,232
What's the most important asset
for a woman to have...

973
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:38,539
- in her line of work?
- Next.

974
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:46,648
Fine.

975
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:49,154
What's the secret
of your success?

976
01:25:49,211 --> 01:25:50,713
You're kidding me, right?

977
01:25:50,779 --> 01:25:53,658
Look, Miss Wheeler,
I am trying to be nice here.

978
01:25:56,952 --> 01:25:58,226
Don't.

979
01:25:58,286 --> 01:25:59,526
What?

980
01:26:01,223 --> 01:26:03,169
Don't be nice.

981
01:26:04,226 --> 01:26:07,105
But why?

982
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:12,602
Because the world is not nice.

983
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:17,014
It is complicated
and it is messy.

984
01:26:17,072 --> 01:26:22,249
It is overflowing with arrogance
and greed and uncertainty.

985
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:26,624
It's a lot of heinous shit.

986
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:30,926
It's a world where bad wins out
every single time.

987
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:38,528
Now, maybe you're
too naive to believe that...

988
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:42,473
or too stupid to learn it.

989
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:46,877
But if you believe in
the good and mercy of others...

990
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:49,438
you will always lose.

991
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:51,882
You will always be the victim.

992
01:26:54,176 --> 01:26:57,453
And then you'll learn, intern.

993
01:26:57,512 --> 01:26:59,992
You'll learn.
