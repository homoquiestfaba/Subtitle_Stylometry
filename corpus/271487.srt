It's not a big deal.

have a chance in hell.

too much time for socializing.

You must regale us all with tales
of what it is that brings you here.

118
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,368
I'm guessing it's to use
your lawyerly charms...

to separate our local fat cats
from their ill-gotten fortunes.

120

Good for a banker to have
someone acceptable for social occasions.

And it's good for you
to have a banker.

But no.
No one knows.

I left home when I was 18,
changed my name, met Phelps, eloped.

150
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,532
We told his family
my father was dead.

151
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,694
Soon that won't be a lie.

152

he means nothing to you.

and the sun is shinin',

155
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:34,577
I might think of him
and remember some small,

156
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,883
pleasant moment
from my earliest days.

157
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:39,583
The way he'd call me
sweet baby girl. [Chuckles]

158
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:43,253
But mostly I remember
how he destroyed absolutely everyone...

of getting close to him.

160

He'll do it to you too,
you know.

161

Be very careful
dredging the past, Adam.

172
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,931
I'll get Sam.

173
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:07,938
This way.

174
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,213
[Lock Opening]

175
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,352
Catch up.

176
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:27,358
I'm gonna lock this door.
Sam'll be in, in a minute.

177
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,360
Thanks.

178
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,911
[Lock Opening]

179
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,618
- Move on.
- [Sam] Get out.

180
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,830
Who the hell are you?

181
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:09,765
Adam Hall. I'm a lawyer
with Kravitz and Bane, Chicago.

182
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,395
You Jew boys never quit, do you?

183
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,803
I'm not Jewish.

184
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,398
How can you work
for Kravitz and Bane?

185
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,206
- Well, we're an equal
opportunity employer.
- Really?

186
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:24,840
I know you got
about 150 partners up there.

187
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,907
How many of 'em are women?

188
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:30,284
I don't really know.
Maybe a dozen.

189
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:33,324
Oh, so you got less
than ten percent women.

190
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:35,723
How many nigger partners you got?

191
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,096
We have four African-American partners.

192
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,964
Well, that's nice. How many
Jewish-American partners you got?

193
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:46,094
- About 80%?
- I don't really know.
It doesn't make a difference to me.

194
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,105
Well, it makes
a big difference to me.

195
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,939
I was always embarrassed to be
represented by such blatant bigots.

196
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,470
Yeah. Well, I think a lot of people
would probably find it appropriate.

197
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,039
- Why are you so nervous?
- I'm not nervous.

198
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:01,779
You afraid I'm gonna come
through that screen and get you?

199
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:05,016
How many death penalty cases
have you handled?

200
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,456
This is my first. [Clears Throat]

201
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:12,020
Oh, great. The Jew bastards sent
a greenhorn to save me.

202
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:16,500
I killed some of their people,
and now they wanna kill me.

203
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,798
I always expected it.

204
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,804
You admit that you killed
the Kramer kids?

205
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:23,636
Who the hell are you to ask me
a question like that?

206
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,699
The jury said I did it.

207
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:29,304
The appeals court said the jury
was right. That's all that matters.

208
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:33,717
How old are you, there, Mr. Hall?

209
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:35,980
Twenty-six.

210
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:39,546
- I'd like to go over
your legal position...
- Born in '69.

211
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,558
That's correct. Looking at your
legal position, I've come up with...

212
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,560
- Where?
- In Memphis.

213
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:47,120
- L... Listen, I'd prefer
to stick to the, uh...
- You grew up there, did you?

214
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,531
I grew up in a lot of places,
mainly southern California.

215
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,195
Mm-hmm.
Your family still there?

216
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,637
[Sighs] Mom's remarried;
and she lives in Portland.

217
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:59,739
And your sister.

218
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:02,371
I believe her name would be Carmen.

219
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,353
College. Berkeley.

220
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:20,864
How did you know?

221
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:24,333
The voice.
You sound just like your daddy.

222
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:28,465
Why'd you come here?

223
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,065
He sent me.

224
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:34,839
I don't have a choice.
But I am gonna save you.

225
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,438
- Save me? [Laughs]
- Yeah.

226
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:40,848
This from the son of a man
that blew his own brains out?

227
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,251
Go to hell,
you little piece of shit.

228
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:46,256
You know who you're talkin' to?
Save me? Why, shit.

229
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:49,020
You don't look like you could save
a turkey from Thanksgiving.

230
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:53,224
Go on, get the hell outta here.
Try to save your own sorry ass.

231
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,790
I am the only person on this earth who
gives a damn whether you live or die.

232
00:18:56,868 --> 00:19:00,099
Now, you are gonna sign this contract
agreeing to be my client,

233
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:02,935
or you will be dead in 28 days.

234
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,768
[Laughs]

235
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:15,277
We're all a bit taken aback at how huge
this case has suddenly become.

236
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:17,583
Uh, what's so huge about it?

237
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,114
Oh, I know the Clarion-Ledger
is not the Chicago Tribune,

238
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:24,753
but in our small pond,
it's everything.

239
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,764
Uh, I'm lost.

240
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,030
Certainly you've seen
today's paper.

241
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,014
Thanks very much.
This'll be just fine.

242
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,677
You let us know if we can
do anything more for you.

243
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,333
Why do you want the right to terminate
my representation without a fight?

244
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:10,898
It took me a long time to fire
those Jew bastards the last time.

245
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,774
I won't go through that again.

246
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,611
- All right, that's reasonable.
- I don't care if you think
it's reasonable or not.

247
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:22,344
It's in the agreement,
and it's nonnegotiable.

248
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,549
Moving right along.
Well, this is ridiculous. No clemency.

249
00:20:28,626 --> 00:20:30,958
If the appeals process fails,
we're going to have to go...

250
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,122
to Governor McAllister
as a last resort, so that...

251
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,689
to preclude clemency at that
point would be suicidal.

252
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:39,203
If I could take David McAllister
into the chamber with me,

253
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,205
I'd die with a smile.

254
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:45,868
I was tried; I was retried.
I got a hung jury both times.

255
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,811
I was free.
I was a free man for 12 years.

256
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,543
And then that sleazy
son of a bitch McAllister...

257
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:56,451
used me to get hisself elected.

258
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,990
No deals with the governor.

259
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:03,860
Fine.

260
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,069
[Sighs]

261
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,430
All right.
Why did you become a Klansman?

262
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:20,210
Because my daddy was in the Klan.

263
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:23,839
- Why did your daddy become a Klansman?
- His daddy was in the Klan.

264
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:27,681
- Great. We got three generations, huh?
- No. Four.

265
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:32,189
Colonel Jacob Cayhall fought
with Nathan Bedford Forrest in the war.

266
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:36,250
And family legend has it that he was
one of the first members of the Klan.

267
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:38,522
So let me see.
I guess that'd make him...

268
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:41,531
your great-great-great-granddaddy.

269
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,693
Do you expect me to feel
proud about that?

270
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:46,999
I don't give a damn
how you feel.

271
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,041
I'm just telling you who you are.
Isn't that why you're here?

272
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,378
All right, the Kramer twins
was the fifth bombing.

273
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,246
What about the real estate office
in Jackson?

274
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:01,581
Well, I lost my virginity
on that one.

275
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,985
It was a crude little thing
with just some sticks and a fuse.

276
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:06,888
- The newspaper office?
- A real fireball.

277
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,153
- The Hirsch Temple?
- Best one yet.

278
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,957
The Kramer office?

279
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:18,731
- It was a good bomb.
But I never meant to kill anybody.
- Really?

280
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:21,966
You bombed the Pinder house and there
were six people sleeping there.

281
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,271
But nobody got hurt, 'cause I planted
the bomb in the garage.

282
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:29,006
I don't make fancy bombs.
They're just simple little things.

283
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,675
But I know where to put them. Like I
told you, I never meant to kill anybody.

284
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,117
- And the twins?
- [Explosion]

285
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:41,692
Casualties of war.

286
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,852
The father losing his legs?
Killing himself?

287
00:22:43,928 --> 00:22:45,862
I don't wanna talk about this.

288
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,593
Are you hiding something from me?
I wouldn't advise it.

289
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,601
I got nothin' to hide.

290
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:54,968
I did what I had to do.
The Klan was at war.

291
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,701
We would've won too,
but we started bombing the Jews.

292
00:22:57,775 --> 00:23:01,768
With all their money they got
the F.B.I., and they beat us.

293
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:04,314
We should've just stayed
to whippin' up on the niggers.

294
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,612
The world would've been
a different place.

295
00:23:06,684 --> 00:23:09,380
Yeah, you can pretend
you're all offended by this.

296
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,617
But deep down inside,
we both know...

297
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,988
that there's a part of you
agrees with me.

298
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,959
That's bullshit.

299
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,429
Why you gettin' so touchy?
What're you hidin'?

300
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:23,365
- I'm not hidin' a thing.
- Like hell you're not.

301
00:23:23,434 --> 00:23:27,097
You're drivin' your car and some
drunk jungle-bunny cuts you off,

302
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,265
his ghetto music blastin'.

303
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,467
What do you think?

304
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,977
Why you darn African-American. No.

305
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,673
[Spits] You think nigger.

306
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,683
If you had any guts,
you'd say so.

307
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:50,087
I'm gonna come back tomorrow.

308
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:53,221
I hurt your little feelings,
have I? Huh?

309
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,997
What'd you expect to find here?
OI' Grandpa Do-Good?

310
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,970
Expect me to go all blubbery
and kiss your behind...

311
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,904
- And sing psalms of forgiveness?
- [Kicking Door]

312
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,534
- I don't know what I expected.
- Sure, you did.

313
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,544
- [Door Unlocking]
- Grandson.

314
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:28,495
- [Phone Ringing]
- Hi. I'm Nora Stark, Attorney Hall.

315
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:30,761
I kind of clean up
after Governor McAllister.

316
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:32,604
- Adam, please.
- Adam it shall be.

317
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,868
- Adam, please.
- Adam it shall be.

318
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:38,807
I'm very curious, Adam. Are you aware
that the identical points raised...

319
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:40,935
in the pending ineffective
counsel petition...

320
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,139
were turned down by Texas
just last month?

321
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:45,944
Actually I am.
It's my opinion, though,

322
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:49,544
that Texas is miles ahead of Mississippi
in many things, including stupidiy.

323
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:52,055
- I'm optimistic.
- [Man] Morning, Counsel.

324
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,092
- [Man] Good morning, Your Honor.
- [Nora, Adam] Good morning.

325
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,995
This is serious business.

326
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:05,263
Ultimate, irreversible punishment
of a fellow human.

327
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:10,137
And time is the purest gold.
When do you plan to file an appeal?

328
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:17,072
Oddly, I had planned on waiting
for the court to issue a ruling...

329
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,616
before appealing it,

330
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,278
Your Honor.

331
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:26,813
However, if, as expected,
uh... Thursday.

332
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:31,554
- And the state's response?
- We agree.

333
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:35,531
- Yes.
- Assuming young counsel opposite
will not be introducing...

334
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,330
- Additional issues on this appeal.
- Obviously not.

335
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:42,271
[Attorney] Uh, Friday... morning.

336
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,002
[Judge Slattery]
You'll have my decision Friday.

337
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:50,706
Can the court expect
additional filings?

338
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:54,479
Are you asking me
my legal strategy, Your Honor?

339
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,520
Not at all, sir.

340
00:25:56,587 --> 00:25:59,613
But I'm thrilled to know
you have one.

341
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,625
You're all dismissed. Now.

342
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:07,688
Carl. How are you?

343
00:26:07,765 --> 00:26:10,962
Adam. Clemency?

344
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:14,527
- I'm contractually bound not to ask.
- You haven't.

345
00:26:14,605 --> 00:26:18,905
But you will. You see, the governor's
a very open-minded man.

346
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:21,035
He's not precluding
anything.

347
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,647
You becomin' a lawyer
must've made Sam proud.

348
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:26,684
Well, Governor, you should be familiar
with his view of the profession.

349
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,912
However, I'd just as soon
keep this discussion...

350
00:26:28,986 --> 00:26:30,954
on the issue and,
as agreed, off the record.

351
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:34,253
I understand you're reconsidering
the state-sanctioned murder...

352
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:36,316
of my client.

353
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,989
- Adam, would you mind?
- No, sir.

354
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:42,624
Adam, I obviously worked very
hard and am extremely proud...

355
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,534
to have won a conviction where
two previous prosecutors have failed.

356
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:50,335
However, while I have no doubt
Sam Cayhall is guilty as charged,

357
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,275
I have always found it very difficult
to believe he acted alone.

358
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:57,041
And as you know, he's never been
inclined to help himself in that regard.

359
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:01,279
Wh-What exactly are you saying? Is
there something specific you know about?

360
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:03,786
No. Certainly not.

361
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:06,517
I just wanna make sure
justice is served.

362
00:27:07,658 --> 00:27:11,924
I see.
So if I should somehow learn...

363
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:15,090
Adam, I take
my power to decide...

364
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:19,102
whether a fellow human should
live or die very seriously.

365
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,936
- If I could somehow be convinced
your client felt the same way...
- [Aide Clears Throat]

366
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:27,410
I'm sorry to rush. Nora, please help out
Mr. Hall in every way we can.

367
00:27:27,478 --> 00:27:31,312
- It was lovely to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

368
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:37,586
- Let me guess.
You're not convinced he's sincere.
- [Door Closes]

369
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:41,147
- Allow me a touch
of healthy skepticism.
- But of course.

370
00:27:41,225 --> 00:27:43,159
However, off the record
and on the issue,

371
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:45,957
you've been given the opportunity
to provide the governor with a cover.

372
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,967
- Love politics.
- Because if he stays
the execution without a reason,

373
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:53,196
he looks to the left like
a friend of the old guard.

374
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,398
He looks to the right
like he's soft on crime.

375
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:58,601
And given it was he who personally won
the conviction in the first place,

376
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,610
he looks to the world
like a big flip-flop.

377
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:04,114
But if I come up with new information,
it gives him an excuse
to follow his conscience.

378
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,173
Let's just say
it expands his options.

379
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:09,276
So to facilitate that,
you've been assigned my new best friend.

380
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:13,687
- Something like that.
- Well, pal, I plan on winning
this one in the courts.

381
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,692
- Even better.
- It's not gettin' to the governor.

382
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,854
Now you're talkin'.
If you need any help at all,

383
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,455
that's home,
that's office.

384
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:23,796
Call me.

[Heavy Door Opening]

389
00:29:10,214 --> 00:29:13,672
I found this
in my motel room last night.

390
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:17,050
Welcome to Dixie. Please try and leave
everything as you found it.

391
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:23,159
Sounds like good manners to me.

392
00:29:23,227 --> 00:29:25,252
It was attached to the timer
of a fake bomb.

393
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,601
What?

394
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,838
Wh-What do you think
I should do about it?

395
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,137
I don't give a damn.
I'm thinkin' about...

396
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:41,736
how that gas they're gonna force
me to sniff...

397
00:29:41,812 --> 00:29:44,747
makes your lungs explode
and come flyin' out your mouth.

398
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:51,812
What motions
you plannin' to file?

399
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:56,892
We're gonna pursue
cruel and unusual.

400
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,522
Aw, three years at Michigan Law,
and that sorry idea's the best you got?

401
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:04,591
In 1984, the legislature passed a law
changing the method of execution...

402
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,603
from the gas chamber
to lethal injection.

403
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:11,574
And that law only applies
to folks sentenced after 1984.

404
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:14,543
I was sent up here in 1980.

405
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:18,309
- Now, what the hell's your point?
- I see that you're up on the law.

406
00:30:18,382 --> 00:30:21,874
I read all the decisions by all
the dead judges. Same as you.

407
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:26,151
- I write some writs for guys on the row.
- You gotten any stays yet?

408
00:30:26,223 --> 00:30:30,683
Then keep your matchbook
law school advice to yourself,
and let me do my job.

409
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:34,219
By changing the lethal injection
to a more humane method,
the state admitted de facto...

410
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:36,789
that the gas chamber
is a cruel method of execution.

411
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:39,700
May I remind counsel,
speaking as the gasee,

412
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:42,500
I'll be just as dead
one way as the other?

413
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:45,565
Sooner or later, yeah.
But I'll take later as a win.

414
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:49,909
I'm bursting with confidence!
I been losing better appeals
than this for 16 years.

415
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:53,178
I feel like those white guys...
always lose to the nigger Globetrotters.

[Chuckles]

417
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,455
Why didn't my dad
get infected with this crap?

418
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:02,959
Oh, we're gonna have our Eddie
talk now, hmm? I'd be careful.

419
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,461
Well, you destroyed him. I mean,
you must feel pretty good about that.

420
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:09,556
I destroyed nothing.
He never tried to understand the Klan.

421
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:12,431
- We were right.
- Oh, you still think you were right?

422
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:17,099
- Look what you got: AIDS and
drugs and bastard children.
- Killer bees?

423
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:20,200
- They come from Africa!
- South America. But that's
probably close enough for you.

424
00:31:20,277 --> 00:31:25,146
- Why're you doin' this?
- 'Cause my life would be easier
if I could just hate you.

425
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,946
But you can't, can you?
'Cause I'm just too lovable.

426
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,749
Well, I'm workin' on it.

427
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:32,880
Christ, your father kills himself in
front of you when you're ten years old,

428
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,517
and then you find out
Grandpa's still alive.

429
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,858
Great! Except that he's
a racist, scumbag, baby-killer!

430
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:43,525
- Why is that not comforting?
- Oh, stop. You're breakin' my heart.

431
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:47,503
It was your hate
that drove him away, wasn't it?

432
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:51,941
Eddie was weak.

433
00:31:53,477 --> 00:31:56,344
I never laid a hand on him.

434
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,848
Never got after him.

435
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:02,147
Never cared who his friends were.
Not even Quince.

436
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:04,744
Who?

437
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:09,350
Qu-Quince Lincoln,
a nigger kid Eddie used to play with.

438
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,726
- Wait a second. I've heard
that name before.
- L-lt don't mean nothin'.

439
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:15,493
Quince Lincoln. He used to mention
that name. He'd have these spells.

440
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,296
- He'd be in his room for three
days mumbling some story...
- Sergeant Packer!

441
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:21,964
- About Quince Lincoln.
- It don't mean nothin'.
Shut up about it.

442
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:24,769
- No. Who's...
- It don't mean nothin'!

- No, I'm up.
- Don't ask me how I know,

448
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:48,131
but the court's going to reject
ineffective counsel.

449
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:54,238
Yeah, I expected that.
Uh, well, I'll be ready to file
the appeal in New Orleans...

450
00:32:54,371 --> 00:32:55,565
the minute the court here rules.

00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,459
- Hello.
- Nora.

455
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,863
- Hi.
- Does the offer to help still stand?

456
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:25,868
Sure.

457
00:33:25,936 --> 00:33:30,100
I need to track down the F.B.I. agent
who was in charge of Sam's case.

458
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:35,242
Sam was of no concern to us,
you understand?

459
00:33:35,312 --> 00:33:39,612
He wasn't active in the really
nasty stuff, so we weren't
keeping close track of him.

460
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:42,652
When did that change?

461
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:47,122
When the civil rights
workers disappeared,
Hoover sent us in with a fury.

462
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,124
We spread money
all over the place.

463
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:53,959
Those people were basically
just ignorant rednecks,
you know. Didn't have a dime.

464
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:58,695
- So we preyed
on their craving for money.
- Uh-huh. Go on.

465
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:03,331
Hey. There's some things
I can talk about and there's
some things I can't talk about.

466
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:07,639
And there's some things I won't
talk about, because I don't like
you lawyers twisting the truth,

467
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:11,272
getting killers off
on some legal technicality.

468
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:16,285
That's bullshit. Besides,
it's too late for new information, kid.

469
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:19,186
The courts won't hear it.
You know that.

470
00:34:19,256 --> 00:34:22,191
The courts don't have
the final say in this case.

471
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:26,491
Besides, you say he wasn't
involved in the nasty stuff.
There's no way he meant to kill.

472
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:29,191
Of course he meant to kill.

473
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:32,201
Marvin Kramer was
a creature of habit.

474
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:35,727
He was in that office
every morning before 8:00.

straight up at 8:00.

The timer was set for 8:00.

477
00:34:41,611 --> 00:34:43,545
That was never introduced
at trial.

00:34:43,613 --> 00:34:47,310
Hey, I can't help it if the damn
lawyers didn't make use of it.
It was in our report.

00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:50,578
Well, I'd like to see
that report.

00:34:50,654 --> 00:34:54,317
Well, I can't help you there.

violent assholes all my life.

of violence.

You know what
I'm talking about.

Why would our F.B.I. friend
not wanna tell us something
about a 30-year-old case?

There are bodies buried everywhere.

00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:28,415
But no one's trying to hide
anything about Sam. They
don't have to. He did it.

490
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:31,325
They just don't want you
sifting through the ashes,

491
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:33,556
'cause they're not sure
what else you might turn up.

492
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,724
- Who is they?
- Everyone.

493
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,734
No one. What difference does it make?

494
00:35:38,802 --> 00:35:43,398
Well, maybe a lot.
I mean, take you, for instance.

495
00:35:43,473 --> 00:35:46,101
Are you really here
to help me?

496
00:35:46,176 --> 00:35:48,736
Or did they assign you
to spy on me?

497
00:35:55,218 --> 00:35:57,209
You ever heard
of the Sovereignty Commission?

498
00:35:57,287 --> 00:36:01,314
- Vaguely.
- Well, it doesn't exist anymore.

499
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:05,623
They started it in the '50s.
It was an official state agency
dedicated to states' rights,

500
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:08,186
i.e., fighting civil rights.

501
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:11,598
Some people think it was
actually coordinating all
of the white citizens' councils.

502
00:36:11,668 --> 00:36:14,296
- What were those?
- Every town had one.

503
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:17,670
A local group
of respectable white people...

504
00:36:17,741 --> 00:36:21,609
professional types,
pillars of their community...

505
00:36:21,678 --> 00:36:23,612
who told the Klan what to do.

506
00:36:25,382 --> 00:36:27,907
So somebody like Sam
wasn't even making decisions.

507
00:36:27,984 --> 00:36:31,215
[Scoffs]
Like our F.B.I. friend said,

508
00:36:31,288 --> 00:36:36,191
they were poor, uneducated bigots who
couldn't find their butts with a map.

509
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:40,593
- The citizens' councils used them
to do their dirty work.
- And the Sovereignty Commission?

510
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:43,531
They kept the records.

511
00:36:45,602 --> 00:36:48,503
- Sam, please sign this.
- I ain't signin' nothin'.

512
00:36:48,572 --> 00:36:51,473
The files are sealed
by the state legislature;
as a defendant on death row,

513
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:53,805
you and only you can apply
to have your files opened.

514
00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:57,479
You're set to die in 20 days.
This might help.

515
00:36:57,547 --> 00:37:00,812
- Help him, maybe. Not me.
- Help who?

516
00:37:00,884 --> 00:37:03,580
The governor, you dumb ass.
Can't you see it?

517
00:37:03,653 --> 00:37:06,554
He can't open the files hisself,
so he gets you to do it for him.

518
00:37:06,623 --> 00:37:08,853
Why? To help me?
[Scoffs]

519
00:37:08,925 --> 00:37:13,055
He put me here. Nah. He's just fishin'
for what every politician wants:

520
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:16,030
dirt on their enemies.

521
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:19,227
What's in those files, Sam?

522
00:37:19,302 --> 00:37:23,363
Nothin' for you. No, it's just
stuff they'd use to twist around
and hurt my people.

523
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,567
I'm your people.

524
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:28,338
Don't you get it? I am.

525
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:31,972
You ain't my real people.
You ain't never met my real people.

526
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:38,153
I don't know how
they got the story.

527
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:41,088
[Lee On Phone]
It's only a matter of time
before they get around to me.

528
00:37:41,157 --> 00:37:45,856
I am sorry. But I might be
onto something. I'm following
some leads from way back.

529
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:48,261
For God's sake, Adam.
Leave it alone.

530
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:50,697
Lee, I really think
I can save him.

531
00:37:52,502 --> 00:37:55,027
Ever occur to you
he might not be worth savin'?

532
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:58,836
- You can't mean that.
- All right, Adam.

533
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:02,504
You wanna know about the past?

534
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:05,241
I'll tell you about the past.

535
00:39:17,787 --> 00:39:19,982
[Lee] This was my tree.

536
00:39:26,896 --> 00:39:29,057
My own...

537
00:39:29,132 --> 00:39:31,066
laurel tree.

538
00:39:33,536 --> 00:39:36,596
I was up there.

539
00:39:41,344 --> 00:39:44,609
Your father was there,
with Quince.

540
00:39:46,783 --> 00:39:48,717
They were eight.
Maybe they were nine.

541
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:50,719
And they were best friends.

542
00:39:56,626 --> 00:40:00,187
They were fightin' and kickin', and
they made so much noise Daddy heard...

543
00:40:00,263 --> 00:40:03,027
and come out to see
what all the ruckus was.

544
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:05,567
You hear me? Go on. Go on.

545
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:07,569
Get on home!

546
00:40:07,637 --> 00:40:10,765
Quince's father did day work
for Daddy.

547
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:15,106
His name was Joe. Daddy never was
very handy at mechanical things,

548
00:40:15,178 --> 00:40:17,874
so Joe fixed things for us;
he made things.

549
00:40:17,947 --> 00:40:20,711
H-He was here, all the time.

550
00:40:20,784 --> 00:40:25,221
So then Quince came back
with his father.

551
00:40:25,288 --> 00:40:28,052
[Joe] My boy, Quince,
said you been beatin' on him.

552
00:40:28,124 --> 00:40:30,558
[Lee] They fought so hard.
Like animals.

553
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:34,757
At one point,
Daddy grabbed the rake.

554
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:36,765
And things got out of hand.

555
00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:41,495
He knocked Joe over.
Joe fell to the ground.

556
00:40:41,571 --> 00:40:43,937
And he yelled for Quince
to run get his shotgun.

557
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:45,634
Go get my shotgun!

558
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:49,201
Sam told Eddie to go get his.
Eddie froze.

559
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:51,270
But Daddy made him go.

560
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:56,207
Joe... was here.

561
00:40:57,353 --> 00:40:59,287
Daddy was there.

562
00:40:59,355 --> 00:41:03,451
- Get in the house. Go on.
- [Lee] Joe waited for his gun.

563
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:05,761
H-He kept lookin' around.

564
00:41:05,894 --> 00:41:08,590
Sam had his.

565
00:41:08,663 --> 00:41:12,394
And then my dear,
sweet father...

566
00:41:13,668 --> 00:41:16,102
[Gasps]

567
00:41:17,572 --> 00:41:19,506
[Exhales]

568
00:41:30,152 --> 00:41:33,019
[Laughs Softly]

569
00:41:34,756 --> 00:41:36,690
This...

570
00:41:36,758 --> 00:41:39,488
was Mississippi...

571
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:41,859
in the early '50s.

572
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:46,460
Daddy said self-defense.

573
00:41:46,535 --> 00:41:50,596
He was never even
so much as arrested.

574
00:41:50,672 --> 00:41:53,641
What were my dad a-and Quince
fightin' about?

575
00:41:59,848 --> 00:42:01,782
A toy soldier.

576
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,308
Eddie thought Quince had stolen it.

577
00:42:05,387 --> 00:42:07,514
That night he found it
under his bed.

578
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:13,159
He took the weight of the world
on his shoulders.

579
00:42:13,228 --> 00:42:15,788
And then he said...

580
00:42:15,864 --> 00:42:18,628
I...

581
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,601
had killed Joe Lincoln too.

582
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:30,269
He said if I had cried out
for Daddy to stop,

583
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:35,246
no way would he have fired.

584
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:38,252
Not with his sweet baby girl watchin'.

585
00:42:42,424 --> 00:42:44,358
Of course he was right.

586
00:42:48,763 --> 00:42:51,231
[Crying] It was my fault too.

587
00:42:57,005 --> 00:42:58,939
[Sobbing]

588
00:43:04,512 --> 00:43:08,471
[Eddie's Voice] It's mine!

589
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:11,075
[Sam's Voice] Get on home!

590
00:43:11,152 --> 00:43:13,382
[Joe's Voice] Quince! Quince!

591
00:43:16,992 --> 00:43:18,926
[Joe Grunting In Pain]

592
00:43:18,994 --> 00:43:21,519
[Exhales]

593
00:43:21,596 --> 00:43:23,530
[Joe's Voice] Help me, Quince.

594
00:43:23,598 --> 00:43:26,260
[Sam's Voice] Get my shotgun!

595
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:35,269
[Lee's Voice] Daddy wasn't
very handy with mechanical things.

596
00:43:36,344 --> 00:43:38,778
Jesus!

597
00:43:38,847 --> 00:43:41,645
- [Alarm Buzzing]
- [Prison Gate Buzzing]

598
00:43:41,716 --> 00:43:45,618
The superintendent asked if you've
been thinkin' about your last meal.

599
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:49,885
- Mmm.
- Special requests can take time.

600
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:52,392
Yeah, I want, uh...

601
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,918
a bowl of Eskimo Pies
and French Market coffee.

602
00:43:55,997 --> 00:43:58,431
It shall be done.

603
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,695
There's been five executions
since you been here, Sam.

604
00:44:00,769 --> 00:44:02,703
You know anything
about any problems with any of 'em?

605
00:44:02,771 --> 00:44:05,137
Come on.

606
00:44:05,206 --> 00:44:08,403
They all died
within 50 feet of me.

607
00:44:08,476 --> 00:44:11,240
Everybody on the row knows everything
about every killin'.

608
00:44:11,313 --> 00:44:14,476
Tell me about Teddy Meeks, then.
I want to hear every detail.

609
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:19,547
They didn't know
what they were doin'.

610
00:44:19,621 --> 00:44:22,215
Everything went wrong.

611
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,224
Have you seen the chamber?

612
00:44:24,292 --> 00:44:27,921
- Not yet.
- Well, there's a little room
off to one side...

613
00:44:27,996 --> 00:44:32,456
where the executioner goes to mix
up his solution of sulfuric acid.

614
00:44:32,534 --> 00:44:35,935
With Meeks,
the executioner was drunk.

615
00:44:36,004 --> 00:44:38,768
- Come on.
- He was drunk.

616
00:44:40,508 --> 00:44:43,944
Anyway. [Sighs]

617
00:44:45,013 --> 00:44:48,210
His first batch of brew didn't work.

618
00:44:48,283 --> 00:44:51,446
And Meeks held his breath
for as long as he could.

619
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:53,783
Then he inhaled
and nothin' happened.

620
00:44:53,855 --> 00:44:56,050
So they waited.

621
00:44:56,124 --> 00:44:58,524
Meeks waited.
The witnesses waited.

622
00:44:58,593 --> 00:45:01,619
And slowly, they turned
toward the executioner,

623
00:45:01,696 --> 00:45:03,630
who's waitin' and cussin'.

624
00:45:03,698 --> 00:45:05,791
He finally goes back
to his little room;

625
00:45:05,867 --> 00:45:09,303
he mixes up another batch
of sulfuric acid and pulls the lever.

626
00:45:09,371 --> 00:45:11,999
This time the sulfuric acid drops
down where it's supposed to.

627
00:45:12,073 --> 00:45:14,803
Pulls the second lever,

628
00:45:14,876 --> 00:45:16,810
droppin' the cyanide pellets.

629
00:45:16,878 --> 00:45:21,372
Sure enough, this gas
starts driftin' upward...

630
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:25,886
to where old Teddy is holdin'
his breath again. [Chuckles]

631
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,324
So finally he sucks in
a whole nose full of it...

632
00:45:32,394 --> 00:45:35,124
and starts shakin' and jerkin'.

633
00:45:35,196 --> 00:45:40,133
Well, somewhere or another
there's a... a metal pole...

634
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:42,601
that runs from the top
of the chamber down to the bottom,

635
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:45,571
and it's right directly
behind the... the chair.

636
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,074
And...

637
00:45:48,143 --> 00:45:50,077
[Exhales]

638
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:57,613
And just about the time
Meeks got real still...

639
00:45:57,685 --> 00:46:00,017
and everybody thought he was dead,

640
00:46:00,088 --> 00:46:03,182
his head starts bangin'
back and forth against that pole.

641
00:46:03,258 --> 00:46:07,524
Just beatin' the hell
out of it like that.

642
00:46:07,595 --> 00:46:11,622
His eyes rolled up in his head,
and his lips opened up real wide.

643
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:14,691
And he was foamin' at the mouth.

644
00:46:14,769 --> 00:46:16,703
And there he was,

645
00:46:18,273 --> 00:46:21,765
just bangin' the back
of his head against that pole.

646
00:46:24,846 --> 00:46:26,780
It was sick.

647
00:46:28,383 --> 00:46:30,351
How long did it take them
to kill him?

648
00:46:30,418 --> 00:46:34,980
According to the prison doctor,
death was instant and painless.

649
00:46:35,056 --> 00:46:39,049
Packer told me it was
the longest five minutes of his life.

650
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:42,790
The guy convulsed and heaved...

651
00:46:42,864 --> 00:46:44,798
and pounded his skull for so long...

652
00:46:44,866 --> 00:46:48,267
that pieces of his brain was
flyin' out the top of his head.

653
00:47:03,017 --> 00:47:05,383
How does this lever they pull
activate the cyanide canister?

654
00:47:07,088 --> 00:47:09,921
- What?
- The lever. Does it work
with hinges or springs?

655
00:47:09,991 --> 00:47:13,154
- I don't know.
- Well, is it just gravity
that's forcing it down?

656
00:47:13,228 --> 00:47:15,219
Well, how in the hell
would I know that?

657
00:47:15,296 --> 00:47:17,787
Just thought you had an aptitude
for this sort of thing.

658
00:47:17,866 --> 00:47:21,632
Well, sue me.
I'm not mechanical.

659
00:47:21,703 --> 00:47:24,171
That's what Lee said.

660
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:27,037
But you were handy enough to build
a bomb to kill the Kramer twins.

661
00:47:27,108 --> 00:47:29,804
Son of a bitch.
Is that what this is all about?

662
00:47:29,878 --> 00:47:33,746
[Chuckles] You must've stayed up
all night thinking of this one.

663
00:47:33,815 --> 00:47:37,251
Sorry, bubba.
I hate to disappoint you,

664
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:41,277
- But, uh, bombs ain't
that complicated.
- They couldn't be that easy.

665
00:47:41,356 --> 00:47:45,349
- I wouldn't know how to do it.
- That's 'cause you're not motivated.

666
00:47:45,426 --> 00:47:48,418
By the time I did Kramer,
I had it down real simple.

667
00:47:48,496 --> 00:47:50,987
So just because you're
an anti-Semite,

668
00:47:51,065 --> 00:47:54,057
you know how to build a bomb,
strategically place it
on the second story,

669
00:47:54,135 --> 00:47:56,194
light a fuse, and then get out
of there without any risk to yourself.

670
00:47:56,271 --> 00:47:59,468
Plenty of risk.
Not much glory.

671
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:04,308
And it was the first floor.
The bomb went off below 'em.
Check the F.B.I. report.

672
00:48:04,379 --> 00:48:06,472
- I did.
- What did it say?

673
00:48:06,548 --> 00:48:09,949
Bomb went off below 'em.

674
00:48:10,018 --> 00:48:12,782
Thank you very much.
Anything else I can help you with?

675
00:48:12,854 --> 00:48:16,051
- How long was the fuse?
- For Pete's sake.

676
00:48:16,124 --> 00:48:19,150
You know, it happened a long time ago.
l-I'm an old man.

677
00:48:19,227 --> 00:48:21,695
My memory isn't that perfect.
Get off my back, here. Will you?

678
00:48:21,763 --> 00:48:23,856
Oh, I'm sure you can remember
killing two little children.

679
00:48:23,932 --> 00:48:27,834
Long enough for me to get
the hell out of there. Okay?

680
00:48:27,902 --> 00:48:32,532
Except for one thing. The bomb
didn't have a fuse. It had a timer.

681
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:37,408
- What are you sayin'?
- I'm sayin' you weren't alone.
There was somebody else.

682
00:48:37,478 --> 00:48:41,107
There's not a chance in hell you could
have built a timing device by yourself.

683
00:48:41,182 --> 00:48:43,673
The F.B.I., they searched
your house, your... your garage.

684
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:47,619
They didn't find a single trace
of explosives anywhere.

685
00:48:47,689 --> 00:48:50,487
Well, maybe they're stupid.

686
00:48:50,558 --> 00:48:53,425
Maybe I was just real careful
and didn't leave a trail.

687
00:48:54,696 --> 00:48:56,664
Yeah. And maybe someone else
planted the bomb.

688
00:48:56,731 --> 00:48:59,495
[Explosion]

689
00:49:03,605 --> 00:49:05,539
You have no idea
what you're doin'.

690
00:49:09,244 --> 00:49:12,077
Just hear me out.
Sam couldn't construct a timer.

691
00:49:12,146 --> 00:49:14,410
His bombs were crude.
They had fuses.

692
00:49:14,482 --> 00:49:16,712
This one was different.
It was complex.

693
00:49:16,784 --> 00:49:19,878
- L-lt was timed.
It was timed to kill.
- Okay. Wait a minute.

694
00:49:19,954 --> 00:49:22,787
Sam did not plant that bomb.
He did not kill those kids.

695
00:49:22,857 --> 00:49:25,261
Wait!

696
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:32,565
The Sovereignty Commission
has a file on Sam.
It might tell who else was involved!

697
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:34,569
Adam, just stop this. Okay?

698
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:36,832
Those files are sealed
by the state legislature.

699
00:49:36,905 --> 00:49:40,204
If your client won't sign, you cannot
move the court to unseal them.

700
00:49:40,276 --> 00:49:42,938
- I bet you know a way
we could take a peek at 'em.
- No.

701
00:49:43,012 --> 00:49:45,412
- You said you wanted to help me.
- I am.

702
00:49:45,481 --> 00:49:47,779
- Maybe you need to do more.
- Maybe I can't do more.

703
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:52,219
Nora, if there's others,
and you're involved in protecting them...

704
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:55,052
l...

705
00:49:55,124 --> 00:49:57,058
Are you threatening me?

706
00:49:57,126 --> 00:49:59,788
I am pursuing the truth
by any means necessary!

707
00:50:05,434 --> 00:50:09,063
Which includes...
politely asking for your help.

708
00:50:12,608 --> 00:50:14,542
[Sighs]

709
00:50:16,478 --> 00:50:19,276
In addition to appealing cruel
and unusual, I wanna file a new motion.

710
00:50:19,348 --> 00:50:21,612
About time you focused
on the law, bubba.

711
00:50:21,684 --> 00:50:24,312
I never stopped focusing
on the law, bubba!

712
00:50:24,386 --> 00:50:26,854
But there is nothing that I will not
pursue in order to get a stay,

713
00:50:26,922 --> 00:50:28,856
including proving
that you're insane.

714
00:50:28,924 --> 00:50:31,392
- I'm insane?
- That's right.

715
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,520
I'm gonna argue that as a product
of three generations of Klan mentality,

716
00:50:34,596 --> 00:50:38,930
your preconscious indoctrination
into hate and distortion
born of irrational fear...

717
00:50:39,001 --> 00:50:41,868
has resulted in diminished mental
capacity to determine right from wrong.

718
00:50:41,937 --> 00:50:46,465
You're gonna argue I'm insane because
I held different political beliefs...

719
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:49,170
than you and your father...

720
00:50:49,244 --> 00:50:52,771
in his naive, nigger-lovin',
bleedin'-heart bullshit!

721
00:50:52,848 --> 00:50:56,682
Well, I probably won't use
those exact words in my brief.

722
00:50:56,752 --> 00:50:59,277
I'll just wait and see
the psychiatrist's report.

723
00:50:59,355 --> 00:51:02,449
- Oh, I'm gonna see a psychiatrist, am I?
- That's right.

724
00:51:02,524 --> 00:51:04,492
Mmm. That's insane.

725
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,189
Killing two five-year-olds
'cause their father was working
for civil rights is insane.

726
00:51:09,598 --> 00:51:11,532
Never meant to kill those kids.

727
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,534
[Scoffs] That's fine.
But it just happens to be the crime...

728
00:51:13,602 --> 00:51:16,537
which you're to be executed
for in exactly 14 days.

729
00:51:22,144 --> 00:51:24,078
Okay.

730
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,014
Good.

731
00:51:28,484 --> 00:51:32,011
I need to go over some more
family background with you.

732
00:51:32,087 --> 00:51:35,818
I got some stuff from Lee,
but there's a lot of holes in it.

733
00:51:53,075 --> 00:51:55,771
She's going through
a tough time right now.

734
00:51:55,844 --> 00:51:59,041
I tried to call her when I saw this,
but she didn't answer.

735
00:52:03,252 --> 00:52:06,449
I think she's drinking again.

736
00:52:07,823 --> 00:52:10,348
Did you know she's an alcoholic?

737
00:52:16,632 --> 00:52:20,932
Have you ever felt feelings
of remorse for any of your crimes?

738
00:52:21,003 --> 00:52:22,937
No.

739
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:28,337
Have you ever apologized
to your victim's family?

740
00:52:30,679 --> 00:52:32,613
No, what would be the point?

741
00:52:34,383 --> 00:52:36,317
What do you think would be the point?

742
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,454
No point.

00:53:10,686 --> 00:53:15,055
I want you to know that
when I talk about your people,

746
00:53:15,123 --> 00:53:17,421
l...

747
00:53:17,493 --> 00:53:19,427
Well...

748
00:53:21,196 --> 00:53:23,130
I hear you, Sam.

[Door Locking]

750
00:54:43,345 --> 00:54:45,279
[Adam] In your professional opinion,
then, does Sam Cayhall...

751
00:54:45,347 --> 00:54:48,248
have anything that might even remotely
be called a conscience?

752
00:54:48,317 --> 00:54:50,785
I found no evidence of one.

753
00:54:50,852 --> 00:54:54,344
Dr. Biddows, in your opinion,
is Sam Cayhall in touch with reality?

754
00:54:54,423 --> 00:54:58,382
- No, he is not.
- Thank you, Dr. Biddows.

755
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,190
No further questions,

757
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:06,733
The state calls
Sergeant Clyde Packer.

758
00:55:10,038 --> 00:55:13,565
Sergeant, would you inform
this court how long...

759
00:55:13,642 --> 00:55:16,008
you have held
your present position, please?

760
00:55:16,078 --> 00:55:20,276
Been running the row for 15 years, sir,
and Sam's been with me the whole time.

761
00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:23,785
And during this time
have you ever observed Mr. Cayhall...

762
00:55:23,852 --> 00:55:25,911
demonstrate he might have a conscience?

763
00:55:25,988 --> 00:55:29,151
Cared about other people's feelings?

764
00:55:29,224 --> 00:55:34,093
Oh, yes, sir. Everybody knows
that Sam has a real bad attitude
toward black folk.

765
00:55:34,162 --> 00:55:38,223
But just the other night he told me to
my face when he says stuff like that...

766
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,066
Let's just say he tried to apologize.
And he didn't even get it all out.

767
00:55:42,137 --> 00:55:46,904
And it sure don't make him no saint.
But, for Sam, that's a big deal.

768
00:55:46,975 --> 00:55:49,944
He most certainly do has
a conscience. Yes, sir.

769
00:55:50,012 --> 00:55:53,413
And during all this time that
you been observin' Mr. Cayhall,

770
00:55:53,482 --> 00:55:58,249
would you say he knows
what's goin' on around him?

771
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,153
Would you say he's out of,
uh, touch with reality?

772
00:56:03,091 --> 00:56:06,060
A couple of nights back, I was
walkin' past, and he said, Clyde.

773
00:56:06,128 --> 00:56:09,461
He never called me that before,
so I knew it was important.

774
00:56:09,531 --> 00:56:11,863
Could I help?
With what, Sam?

775
00:56:11,933 --> 00:56:16,700
And he said, I wanna die alone.
And I wanna die in decent clothes.

776
00:56:16,772 --> 00:56:19,605
And I wanna eat an Eskimo Pie.

777
00:56:19,675 --> 00:56:21,768
And could I see a sunrise?

778
00:56:21,843 --> 00:56:25,438
I said, Last one's on me, Sam.

779
00:56:25,514 --> 00:56:29,644
So I snuck him out,
gave him a hour alone.

780
00:56:29,718 --> 00:56:33,950
I watched through the inside.
I thought he might lose it
once the sun started comin'.

- Try again. What has he been workin' on?

- Nora?

- No.
- Then what kind of information?

00:57:26,374 --> 00:57:30,572
- Anything, everything. He's desperate.
- Where is he lookin'?

- Well, find out.

should be followed through.

823
01:00:35,729 --> 01:00:38,323
- Marvin Kramer.
- Or Martin King.

824
01:00:38,399 --> 01:00:41,630
Law office, March 18.
It's Marvin Kramer.

825
01:00:41,702 --> 01:00:44,637
- When was the bombing?
- April 28.

826
01:00:47,908 --> 01:00:50,672
Action agreed September 2.
I thought you said it was in April.

827
01:00:50,744 --> 01:00:53,304
That's not a date.
That's nine to two.

828
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,314
- Jesus Christ, they took a vote.
- Oh, my God.

829
01:00:55,382 --> 01:00:59,341
- Commission assigned S.C.
- Sam Cayhall. What's R.W.?

830
01:01:01,488 --> 01:01:03,422
You mean, who's R.W.

831
01:01:15,235 --> 01:01:17,499
[Dog Barking]

832
01:01:17,571 --> 01:01:19,505
Hi. Thanks.

833
01:01:21,342 --> 01:01:23,276
[Truck Honking]

834
01:01:27,781 --> 01:01:29,715
Truth time, Sam. Five days.

835
01:01:29,783 --> 01:01:34,482
We're firing everything we have
up to the Supreme Court, but...

836
01:01:34,555 --> 01:01:37,217
I need to know who R.W. is.

837
01:01:42,963 --> 01:01:47,525
Sam. I saw the Commission's files.
You were with someone named R.W.

838
01:01:47,601 --> 01:01:50,126
The two of you were assigned
to bomb the Kramer office.

839
01:01:50,204 --> 01:01:53,230
Assigned by the same people
who took no responsibility
for the death of those kids...

840
01:01:53,307 --> 01:01:56,799
and, as far as I can see, are gonna take
no responsibility for you.

841
01:01:58,479 --> 01:02:02,245
l-I believe you call
these people cowards.

842
01:02:02,316 --> 01:02:05,843
Why in God's name you feel compelled
to protect them is beyond me.

843
01:02:08,722 --> 01:02:10,656
First of all,

844
01:02:11,892 --> 01:02:14,554
you sniveling little
son of a bitch,

845
01:02:14,628 --> 01:02:18,655
if you ever speak to me like
this again, I'll rip your heart
out and shove it up your butt.

846
01:02:18,732 --> 01:02:23,101
Second, if you spent half as much time
learnin' to be a lawyer...

847
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:26,230
instead of playin' Dick Tracy,

848
01:02:26,306 --> 01:02:29,002
I might stand a chance
of not bein' dead in five days.

849
01:02:30,444 --> 01:02:34,039
As it stands right now,
everything you tried has failed.

850
01:02:35,449 --> 01:02:37,383
You've failed!

851
01:02:37,451 --> 01:02:41,410
Now I have to pay the price.

852
01:02:41,488 --> 01:02:44,423
You're a failure!
Just like your pathetic father was.

853
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:47,790
That son of a bitch didn't have
the balls to live.

854
01:02:47,861 --> 01:02:50,193
He was a loser and a quitter.

855
01:02:50,264 --> 01:02:52,960
And he just gave his life away.

856
01:02:53,033 --> 01:02:56,264
How dare he?

857
01:02:56,336 --> 01:02:58,270
What right did he have
to do that?

858
01:02:58,338 --> 01:03:01,967
- It wasn't his to give!
I gave it to him!
- [Guard] Hey, hey, Sam!

859
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:03,976
His mama gave it to him!
It was God's!

860
01:03:04,044 --> 01:03:07,912
- He had no right!
He just gave it away, goddamn it!
- [Guards Shouting]

861
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:11,815
- You hear me? He gave it away!
- [Guard Shouting]

862
01:03:11,885 --> 01:03:15,480
- Why'd he do that?
- [Packer] Come on.

863
01:03:15,556 --> 01:03:20,493
- [Inmates, Guards Shouting]
- [Heavy Door Slams]

864
01:03:28,068 --> 01:03:32,095
- Hi. Is she home?
- Miss Lee's upstairs restin'.
She can't see you now.

865
01:03:33,907 --> 01:03:35,841
Lee?

866
01:03:37,411 --> 01:03:40,312
Uh, where are you, Lee?

867
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,314
Lee?

868
01:03:43,884 --> 01:03:45,818
Lee?

869
01:03:47,254 --> 01:03:49,848
Lee?

870
01:03:49,923 --> 01:03:52,517
[Exhales]

871
01:03:54,762 --> 01:03:57,492
[Laughing]

872
01:03:57,564 --> 01:03:59,794
Oh, Jesus.

873
01:04:13,447 --> 01:04:16,848
Lucky little nephew.

874
01:04:21,155 --> 01:04:24,181
Did I ever show you...

875
01:04:24,258 --> 01:04:27,523
my favorite old family picture?

876
01:04:29,062 --> 01:04:32,896
[Laughs] Come here.

877
01:04:32,966 --> 01:04:34,900
I'm coming.

878
01:04:36,203 --> 01:04:38,137
Mmm?

879
01:04:39,606 --> 01:04:42,905
I never kept
an actual photo album.

880
01:04:42,976 --> 01:04:47,276
Mostly because I never kept
any actual photos.

881
01:04:47,347 --> 01:04:49,281
Here. Come here.

882
01:04:56,123 --> 01:04:59,581
Here. Now, there.

883
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:02,652
[Laughs] See?
[Kissing Sounds]

884
01:05:02,729 --> 01:05:05,323
He was a cute little thing,
wasn't he?

885
01:05:07,367 --> 01:05:11,098
The problem is,
he was raised...

886
01:05:11,171 --> 01:05:13,639
to be a monster.

887
01:05:17,811 --> 01:05:20,405
Trained from birth.

888
01:05:25,752 --> 01:05:28,243
We come from a long line...

889
01:05:28,322 --> 01:05:31,450
of hate, Adam.

890
01:05:31,525 --> 01:05:35,393
[Crying, Chuckling]
That's why I drink.

891
01:05:35,462 --> 01:05:37,760
Make it all go away.

892
01:05:37,831 --> 01:05:40,629
[Sobbing] Now you're here.

893
01:05:40,701 --> 01:05:45,297
And it won't go away anymore.

894
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:52,270
Go home.

895
01:06:07,394 --> 01:06:09,885
I've got three things
to say to you.

896
01:06:09,963 --> 01:06:11,954
Number one.
I'm your lawyer until you fire me.

897
01:06:12,032 --> 01:06:14,193
I'm not quitting.
Number two.

898
01:06:14,267 --> 01:06:18,567
The day you killed Joe Lincoln,
your sweet little seven-year-old
daughter was in the laurel tree.

899
01:06:18,638 --> 01:06:21,903
She watched her daddy murder
a defenseless man in cold blood.

900
01:06:21,975 --> 01:06:24,808
And three.
Quince Lincoln never stole a thing.

901
01:06:24,878 --> 01:06:28,814
My father found that toy soldier
underneath his bed,
but he was too terrified to tell you.

902
01:06:28,882 --> 01:06:32,841
He had to live with that
for the rest of his sad life.

903
01:06:32,919 --> 01:06:37,083
Maybe you didn't have the balls
to put a stop to this, Sam. But I do.

904
01:06:37,157 --> 01:06:41,184
It ends with me.
We got four days left.

905
01:06:41,261 --> 01:06:44,788
This is our last appeal, and it's
called mitigating circumstances.

906
01:06:44,865 --> 01:06:47,595
Talk to me.

907
01:06:48,935 --> 01:06:51,096
Talk to me, Sam!

908
01:06:53,206 --> 01:06:55,140
I'm tired of talkin'.

909
01:06:57,644 --> 01:07:02,479
I'm tired of wakin' up every mornin'
knowin' I'm one day closer to dyin'.

910
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:06,485
I'm tired of livin' in a cage,
tired of these crappy cigarettes.

911
01:07:06,553 --> 01:07:08,987
[Chuckles] Just prayin' I'll die
of cancer before they...

912
01:07:09,055 --> 01:07:10,989
gas me.

913
01:07:12,359 --> 01:07:16,056
[Sighs]
But mostly I'm just tired of waitin'.

914
01:07:22,736 --> 01:07:24,670
Just let me rest.

915
01:07:24,738 --> 01:07:28,367
I'm really touched you feel close enough
to share your feelings with me, Sam.

916
01:07:28,441 --> 01:07:30,466
But at the moment,
I don't really give a damn.

917
01:07:30,544 --> 01:07:34,503
I'm too busy tryin'
to win my case.

918
01:07:34,581 --> 01:07:37,015
Now, start talking!

919
01:07:38,885 --> 01:07:40,819
Here are some synonyms
for mitigating.

920
01:07:40,887 --> 01:07:44,448
Glossing over, sugarcoating,

921
01:07:44,524 --> 01:07:46,458
prettifying.

922
01:07:46,526 --> 01:07:49,495
There's nothing pretty
about twin boys being blown to bits.

923
01:07:49,563 --> 01:07:52,054
There's no glossing over
the suicide of their father.

924
01:07:52,132 --> 01:07:54,760
And there's
no sugarcoating this fact:

925
01:07:54,835 --> 01:07:58,703
My client is guilty,
and he deserves to be punished.

926
01:08:01,107 --> 01:08:04,440
Mens rea: to do the thing.

927
01:08:04,511 --> 01:08:06,775
Sam Cayhall did the thing.

928
01:08:06,847 --> 01:08:09,111
But he does not deserve
to be murdered,

929
01:08:09,182 --> 01:08:12,242
because he was taught
from birth that he had to do the thing.

930
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:15,288
That is what this court
must come to understand.

931
01:08:15,355 --> 01:08:17,380
He never knew he had
any other recourse...

932
01:08:17,457 --> 01:08:20,392
but hatred and bigotry
and violence.

933
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:25,397
His uncles were Klansmen, his brothers,
his father, even his grandfather.

934
01:08:25,465 --> 01:08:29,731
His great-grandfather was
one of the cofounding members
of that hateful organization.

935
01:08:29,803 --> 01:08:33,569
I recently saw a photograph
of him a-at a lynching.

936
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:36,507
He was ten,
and it was his third.

937
01:08:38,144 --> 01:08:41,136
Of course this is awful.
It... It's evil.

938
01:08:41,214 --> 01:08:44,581
But blood and death were served
with Sunday breakfast.

939
01:08:46,086 --> 01:08:49,522
His father was murdered at a funeral.
My client saw it.

940
01:08:52,058 --> 01:08:55,892
As the court is no doubt aware,
my client is also my grandfather.

941
01:08:55,962 --> 01:09:00,558
I'd like now to tell you some warm
and wonderful stories about our family.

942
01:09:00,634 --> 01:09:02,568
Except I don't know any.

943
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:08,530
In fact, I don't find
my grandfather even remotely wonderful.

944
01:09:09,743 --> 01:09:11,768
But I know this.

945
01:09:11,845 --> 01:09:14,109
The very things that
make him so monstrous...

946
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:17,547
are the very reasons that mitigate
against this state murdering him.

947
01:09:17,617 --> 01:09:20,347
He was raised by his family
and by this state...

948
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:22,718
to become the man that he became.

949
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:25,451
By the time he was old enough
to choose, he didn't have a choice.

950
01:09:26,993 --> 01:09:28,927
This is the tragedy of Sam Cayhall.

951
01:09:31,398 --> 01:09:35,892
It's a tragedy that has
destroyed three lives already.

952
01:09:37,604 --> 01:09:40,368
In the name of mercy,

953
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:44,536
let it not murder what little
is left of his life.

954
01:10:01,661 --> 01:10:04,459
[Sighs]
Thank you for seeing me like this.

955
01:10:04,531 --> 01:10:07,364
Why are you here?

956
01:10:09,169 --> 01:10:13,162
I'm hoping you'll ask the governor
to show some mercy.

957
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:15,673
Tell him that you don't want
my client to die.

958
01:10:15,742 --> 01:10:18,040
I don't want him to die.

959
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:21,740
I don't want him to.
But I feel he must.

960
01:10:21,815 --> 01:10:24,545
See, that's...
that's not true. It isn't.

961
01:10:24,617 --> 01:10:27,415
Your word would carry a lot
of weight with the governor,

962
01:10:27,487 --> 01:10:30,888
and no one knows more than you that
there's already been enough suffering.

963
01:10:30,957 --> 01:10:33,858
It could all end right here.
Right now.

964
01:10:36,229 --> 01:10:40,996
I didn't take them to nursery school
that mornin' because I was sick.

965
01:10:41,067 --> 01:10:45,094
So I waved good-bye
from my bedroom window...

966
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:48,334
and watched them leapfrog off
to their death.

967
01:10:48,408 --> 01:10:50,899
Bye, Mommy! I love you!

968
01:10:50,977 --> 01:10:53,070
[Mrs. Kramer]
The whole thing was my fault.

969
01:10:53,146 --> 01:10:55,512
Be good!

970
01:10:57,751 --> 01:11:00,413
- Adam.
- Ma'am?

971
01:11:00,487 --> 01:11:03,081
Why are you really here?

972
01:11:12,032 --> 01:11:17,197
I came home one day and found my father
on the floor with a gun in his hand.

973
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:21,604
And I remember wondering,
What are all those towels doing there?

974
01:11:23,443 --> 01:11:28,210
And then I realized that he had arranged
the towels in a circle...

975
01:11:28,281 --> 01:11:31,250
and then very carefully...

976
01:11:31,317 --> 01:11:34,309
laid down in the center of them
so that he wouldn't make a mess.

977
01:11:36,523 --> 01:11:39,720
In his note, he... he said
that he loved me.

978
01:11:39,793 --> 01:11:42,956
And he was sorry, and...

979
01:11:43,029 --> 01:11:45,259
he hoped that
one day I'd understand.

980
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:49,267
He told me I'd have to take care
of Mom and my sister.

981
01:11:51,137 --> 01:11:54,163
There was a plastic garbage bag
on the floor next to him.

982
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:58,574
I was supposed to put the towels
in the bag, clean up the mess
and call the police.

983
01:11:58,645 --> 01:12:01,136
Don't touch the gun,
he said.

984
01:12:01,214 --> 01:12:03,375
Hurry up before the girls get home.

985
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:08,614
See, he had picked a day
when he knew I'd be the first one home.

986
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:12,424
I was ten.

987
01:12:13,526 --> 01:12:16,461
I would dearly love

both our families.

Why?

993
01:12:31,744 --> 01:12:36,681
He has to die because I had champagne
at my birthday party.

994
01:12:36,749 --> 01:12:40,515
He has to die
because a story needs an ending.

995
01:12:42,822 --> 01:12:47,555
He has to die because...
I don't care if he had no choice.

996
01:12:47,627 --> 01:12:51,063
He chose to bomb that building.

997
01:12:51,131 --> 01:12:53,065
And my family died.

He was a dish washer.

1230
01:34:57,387 --> 01:35:01,653

Mr. Cayhall may not have acted alone
in this heinous crime.

1242

Now, if these allegations
prove to be true,

1243

rest assured,
anyone found to be involved...

it does not change...

1248
01:35:58,681 --> 01:36:00,672

The capital murder was committed
while the defendant was engaged...

1323
01:44:59,522 --> 01:45:01,456
in the commission of a felony.

1324
01:45:01,524 --> 01:45:04,960
The capital murder was especially
heinous, atrocious and cruel.

1325
01:45:05,027 --> 01:45:07,325
We, the jury, find unanimously,
from the evidence...

1326
01:45:07,397 --> 01:45:11,697
and beyond a reasonable doubt,
the defendant, Sam Cayhall,
should be put to death...

1327
01:45:11,768 --> 01:45:14,464
by lethal gas at the
Mississippi State Penitentiary,

1328
01:45:14,537 --> 01:45:18,735
Parchman, Mississippi,
the 13th day of April, 1996.

1329
01:45:18,808 --> 01:45:21,436
[Yells]

1330
01:45:21,511 --> 01:45:23,638
And no stays.

1331
01:45:23,713 --> 01:45:26,477
Is there any reason
why this execution should not proceed?

1332
01:45:26,549 --> 01:45:28,483
No.

1333
01:45:29,685 --> 01:45:31,619
Any final words,
Mr. Cayhall?

1334
01:45:35,324 --> 01:45:37,849
[Breathing Heavily]

1335
01:45:55,278 --> 01:45:58,213
[Gas Hissing]

1336
01:47:55,064 --> 01:47:57,498
[Sighs]

1337
01:48:00,169 --> 01:48:02,103
[Sighs]

1338
01:48:09,211 --> 01:48:11,805
Maybe the ghosts are gone, Lee.

1339
01:48:12,882 --> 01:48:14,816
[Exhales]

1340
01:48:15,918 --> 01:48:17,852
Maybe.

1341
01:48:22,992 --> 01:48:25,654
Thank you, Adam.
