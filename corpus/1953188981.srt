1
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:53,787
Yes, now, you
pick out the collar.

2
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:55,296
You tell me which
one you want.

3
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:55,955
Which one?

4
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,725
Which one?

5
00:00:56,787 --> 00:00:58,562
Yes.

6
00:00:58,622 --> 00:01:01,831
I don't know if there's anything
here I could possibly use.

7
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:02,529
Mr. Webber?

8
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:03,537
Yeah.

9
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:04,732
Matt Reeder,
International Gifts.

10
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:06,468
Oh, right, right.

11
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,406
Yeah, how are you doing?

12
00:01:07,465 --> 00:01:08,443
Good.

13
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:09,409
He's not
talking today.

14
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:10,707
Yeah.

15
00:01:10,768 --> 00:01:13,408
You know, why don't you
wait back in the stockroom.

16
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:14,506
Thank you.

17
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:17,576
Anything with fur?

18
00:01:20,277 --> 00:01:23,087
Ooh, that's gonna' hurt.

19
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:25,149
Mulligan?

20
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:29,722
Is he a member?

21
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:33,795
Shit.

22
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:37,863
Oops.

23
00:01:37,928 --> 00:01:40,465
I have a question for you.

24
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:43,205
Being an employee here, do you
get to play a lot of golf?

25
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:44,405
Yeah, that's
why I work here.

26
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:45,276
Yeah?

27
00:01:45,336 --> 00:01:46,246
What's your handicap?

28
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:47,338
Six.

29
00:01:47,404 --> 00:01:48,610
Me, tool

30
00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:49,377
No, really?

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,918
Yeah.

32
00:01:49,974 --> 00:01:51,317
Well, six-pack.

33
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,616
I'm a really good drinker.

34
00:01:53,677 --> 00:01:54,655
That's corny.

35
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:57,955
I know, that's terrible.

36
00:01:58,015 --> 00:02:00,962
What do you say we go
hit some balls sometime?

37
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:03,020
I'll drive the cart around.

38
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:05,158
I can watch your stroke.

39
00:02:05,222 --> 00:02:06,292
Cinda.

40
00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:07,165
Uhh, Preston.

41
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:07,929
Hi.

42
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:08,970
How are you, buddy?

43
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:10,437
You've got a great smile, man.

44
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:12,064
You must have a
good dental planner.

45
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:13,039
Sam Schooler.

46
00:02:13,097 --> 00:02:14,167
How are you?

47
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:15,437
So, what do you got?

48
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:18,480
Now, the unique feature
of The Dreaming Dog Watch,

49
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:21,540
Mr. Webber, is the animation.

50
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:24,848
As the seconds tick by, you
can actually see what the dog

51
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:26,445
is dreaming about.

52
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,511
Huh!

53
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:31,993
I'll be darned!

54
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:32,857
It's clever.

55
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:33,987
Yeah.

56
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:36,361
And if you look, you'll
notice all the animation.

57
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,993
We call it The Frustrated
Golfer's Watch.

58
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:41,536
And you can see all the curse
symbols after you get

59
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:42,900
a little back slice.

60
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,802
Slut!

61
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:44,430
You know what I mean?

62
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:45,269
We've all been there.

63
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:46,637
I know I have.

64
00:02:46,697 --> 00:02:48,699
It's priced right.

65
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:50,473
What rates you got?

66
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:52,411
n is just the
one for the moment.

67
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:53,573
But we are..

68
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:56,049
Oh, no, you see, Matt,
my customers would buy this

69
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:57,881
watch like crazy, okay?

70
00:02:57,942 --> 00:03:00,513
Provided you had
their dog on it.

71
00:03:00,578 --> 00:03:01,579
Oh, hold on.

72
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:03,147
Call me crazy,
maybe it's just me,

73
00:03:03,213 --> 00:03:05,318
but aren't all your
members golfers?

74
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:06,360
Uhh, yeah.

75
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:07,657
And they all wear
watches, don't they?

76
00:03:07,718 --> 00:03:09,459
Yeah, just
not novelty watches.

77
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,897
Ahh, gotcha'.

78
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:12,866
More of a Rolex crowd.

79
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:14,463
I mean, a lady with a
Yorkie is not going to buy a

80
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:16,664
watch, as cute as it
is, with a Lab on it.

81
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:17,797
Well, I know
what you mean...

82
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:20,000
You gotta' get
all the breeds, all right?

83
00:03:20,064 --> 00:03:22,066
Yeah, see, I like to follow
give

84
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:24,738
the customer what they want.

85
00:03:24,802 --> 00:03:26,110
You know what I'm saying?

86
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,581
Yeah, I gotta' go.

87
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:28,582
Careful now.

88
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,448
He jumps.

89
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:32,180
You're going to tell
me that this isn't quality?

90
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:33,653
That's
exactly what I'm saying.

91
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:35,622
And I'm also saying that you,
you need to pick up

92
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:39,126
a book on salesmanship.

93
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:43,360
Yeah, well, I
wrote that book, buddy!

94
00:03:46,523 --> 00:03:47,831
Hi.

95
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:49,165
Walter, I
see you're still at it.

96
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:50,705
First time I ever
double-crossed the governor.

97
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:53,037
What can I do for you?

98
00:03:53,097 --> 00:03:54,440
Would
you mind if I sat down?

99
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:55,977
There's been a
lamp burning in the window for

100
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,876
you honey, go ahead.

101
00:03:57,935 --> 00:03:59,039
Oh, I jumped out
that window a long time ago.

102
00:03:59,103 --> 00:04:00,980
You can hit your
head against the wall,

103
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:04,315
try every angle,
rack your brain,

104
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:08,790
and then one day out of
the blue, you get an idea.

105
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:10,985
The big idea.

106
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:13,619
The one you've
been waiting for.

107
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:18,394
A chance to win.

108
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:20,230
I'm going to
go to bed, honey.

109
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,705
I've got a six o'clock flight.

110
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:31,372
Being with Gina made me
want to do anything to win.

111
00:04:31,435 --> 00:04:36,435
<i>J")</i>

112
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:27,629
Well, I can
appreciate that, sir...

113
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:29,193
I'm not here!

114
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:31,899
...but our accountant
has been super busy.

115
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:33,168
Mr. Bederman.

116
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,174
Uh-huh.

117
00:05:34,231 --> 00:05:36,438
No, he's in a meeting.

118
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,478
Yes, sir.

119
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:38,512
All right.

120
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:39,946
Mam

121
00:05:40,003 --> 00:05:41,573
It's here!

122
00:05:41,638 --> 00:05:45,518
Brenda, you get a raise.

123
00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:46,077
<i>Sammy!</i>

124
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:47,520
Huh?

125
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:49,615
Ooh, is that it?

126
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,182
Yeah, Okay.

127
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:52,158
Where's Brenda?

128
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:52,694
Brenda?

129
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,455
Where's she at?

130
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:54,655
Hold my calls!

131
00:05:54,718 --> 00:05:56,891
Okay.

132
00:05:56,954 --> 00:05:58,058
Now...

133
00:05:58,122 --> 00:05:58,896
I always wanted to
sell a million of something.

134
00:05:58,956 --> 00:05:59,934
Let's see this!

135
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,435
I babied this one.

136
00:06:01,492 --> 00:06:03,631
Calling Hong Kong all night,
faxing diagrams

137
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:04,570
back and forth...

138
00:06:04,628 --> 00:06:05,299
Come on, cut the shit!

139
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:05,863
Let's do this! do this!

140
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:06,737
Let me see it!

141
00:06:06,797 --> 00:06:13,146
And now, The
Lucky Lottery Watch.

142
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:14,045
Wow!

143
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:16,345
Lottery Watch?

144
00:06:16,406 --> 00:06:17,680
That's beautiful!

145
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:18,913
Six winning numbers.

146
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:20,080
Wait, is it
different every time?

147
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:21,088
Totally random.

148
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:22,453
Wow, It's amazing, man

149
00:06:22,513 --> 00:06:24,618
Imagine how many places we're
going to sell that bad boy!

150
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:26,092
First of all, everyone
who sells a lottery ticket.

151
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,925
Chain stores,
department stores.

152
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:28,554
Vegas!

153
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:29,188
Vegas!

154
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:30,061
Vegas!

155
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,497
We're going to Vegas!

156
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:33,228
Excuse me, guys,
but product development is

157
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,633
essentially defining
a need, right?

158
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:36,102
Exactly.

159
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,332
Does someone playing
the lottery really need a

160
00:06:37,394 --> 00:06:39,374
watch to pick their numbers?

161
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:40,134
Bean!

162
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:42,404
Bean!

163
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:43,968
This is not a watch.

164
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:45,308
Nope.

165
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:48,839
We, you and I,
are selling a dream!

166
00:06:48,906 --> 00:06:49,850
That's right, baby.

167
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:50,908
Hold this, take it.

168
00:06:50,974 --> 00:06:52,009
Sixty million people
play the lottery.

169
00:06:52,075 --> 00:06:54,248
This is a product
that can not missi

170
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:55,551
Yeah, well, we have a
storeroom full of products

171
00:06:55,612 --> 00:06:57,353
that can't miss. We got the
remote control beer mug.

172
00:06:57,414 --> 00:06:59,360
There's thousands of those.

173
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,554
We've got that handbag.

174
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:01,652
Bad ideal

175
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:03,026
And the Fish Stories clock?

176
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:04,656
Guys!

177
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:06,962
Whoa, whoa, hey,
Professor Positive.

178
00:07:07,024 --> 00:07:09,334
You didn't
even invent that.

179
00:07:09,393 --> 00:07:10,997
Yeah, I like it.

180
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:11,869
Amazing!

181
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:13,408
It's good, man.

182
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:14,874
Let's make a million, huh?

183
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:23,475
You push this button on
the side of the case

184
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,248
and six numbers pop up.

185
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,516
Six numbers.

186
00:07:27,578 --> 00:07:31,355
Different numbers every time.

187
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:34,123
How's he come up
with all these ideas?

188
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:35,390
Well,
believe it or not,

189
00:07:35,452 --> 00:07:39,366
he used to claim it was the
hops, you know, in beer.

190
00:07:39,423 --> 00:07:42,666
Now it's the universal mind.

The universal mind.

192
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:47,232
Their bookkeepers
theory is all ideas come from

193
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:49,868
some kind of collective
consciousness,

194
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:54,313
one universal mind.

197
00:07:57,207 --> 00:08:00,518
But to Matt, you know, it made
perfect sense that all ideas

198
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:03,456
are floating around in space
like some kind of old radio

199
00:08:03,513 --> 00:08:12,228
and TV broadcast, and his
mind is a receiving station.

200
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:14,360
A receiving station.

201
00:08:14,424 --> 00:08:16,165
I know
he's <i>3</i> little off.

202
00:08:16,226 --> 00:08:17,762
Yes, but that's
why you liked him.

203
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:18,738
I know.

00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:21,435
That's what I've
always liked about him.

You know what I mean?

210
00:08:19,772 --> 00:08:20,750
Yeah.

211
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:23,378
Now, we are going to
need seed money

212
00:08:23,443 --> 00:08:26,549
for the new watch.

213
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:28,455
No, we're not going
to the casino, okay?

We're not
going to the casino.

217
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:32,362
That's right.

218
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:34,193
All right.

219
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:35,163
We're going
to the dog track.

220
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:37,565
That is the
same difference.

221
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:38,465
It's a big difference.

222
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:39,901
It's a dog track,
it's not a casino.

223
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:42,735
And if Gina asks you, "Did
you go to the casino?"

224
00:08:42,795 --> 00:08:43,500
And she will!

00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:44,507
Fine.

226
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:47,170
Say no with authority,
because it's true.

227
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:47,870
It's not the casino.

228
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:49,413
Say, "No, goddamnit, Gina!

229
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:51,210
I did not go to
the fucking casino!

230
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,977
I told you I
wouldn't, didn't I"

00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,449

It cost him a lot of
money, and two marriages.

But he shrugs it off.

What?

00:09:31,277 --> 00:09:32,278
See that
dog taking a shit?

NO, no, man.

00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:44,767
Look, he's coming
down from a beating.

259
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:46,735
Okay, listen to me.

260
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:49,774
Ahh, a jockey told Carl the
bartender that if you see a

261
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:53,072
horse shit before a race,
you bet all you got on him.

262
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:53,974
He said that.

263
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:56,070
The dog is shitting,
and that's why

264
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:57,079
you're betting on him?

265
00:09:57,136 --> 00:09:58,809
Yeah. Think about
it. Look at me!

266
00:09:58,871 --> 00:09:59,679
He's twenty-two to one.

267
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:00,649
Come on, it
makes sense, right?

268
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:03,118
He's lighter, he's
happy, he's relaxed.

269
00:10:03,176 --> 00:10:03,881
It's horrible!

270
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:04,921
Think about it.

271
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:06,183
LETS do this, all right?

272
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:07,087
Come on, he's a jockey.

273
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:08,022
Why would he lie?

274
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:09,116
Now, calm down,
let's take it slow.

275
00:10:09,182 --> 00:10:10,183
We just got here, Okay?

276
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:11,091
Okay, so
how much you got?

277
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,288
I got two twenty.

278
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,925
Can I have a ten dollar
two-four on..., and a ten

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,814

it...Put away your money.

And they're off!

286
00:10:40,113 --> 00:10:44,789
In the lead, followed by
Late For Dinner and Can Dot

287
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:46,387
Come on, come
on, come on, come on!

288
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:47,760
They're going
into the first turn!

289
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,097
Down in the back stretch, A
Flea's Ferrari chases down the

290
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:53,194
number 2 Can Dot

291
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:59,505
Can Do gets passed.l As they
head for the wire,

292
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:02,978
it's A Flea's Ferrari pulling
away now by a length!

293
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:08,678
A Flea's Ferrari takes it!

294
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:11,415
Four hundred dollars
on the dog shit theory.

295
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:15,015
You should be proud.

296
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:17,687
Fucking Can Do bullshit.

297
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,354
I can't blame Sam.

298
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:22,331
He was just trying to raise
money for our business.

299
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:25,528
Sam did construction for a
while before we teamed up.

300
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:27,537
Me, I've never had a job.

301
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:29,368
I've always worked for myself.

302
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:33,706
It can be tough, long hours,
no guaranteed paycheck.

303
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:36,144
But you have a chance to win.

304
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:37,545
Bye, girl.

305
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:38,274
Bye,

306
00:11:38,337 --> 00:11:40,180
Bye, see ya'-

307
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:51,155
So I go out there and the gate
agent's asking for volunteers,

308
00:11:51,217 --> 00:11:52,787
you know, to give
up their seats.

309
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:54,593
Sounded like a game show host.

310
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,361
'A voucher for a
room at the Marriott,

311
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:58,493
and we'll get you
out on the seven A.M.

312
00:11:58,558 --> 00:11:59,502
non-stop!

313
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,663
Anybody?'

314
00:12:00,726 --> 00:12:03,536
So these two guys sitting
there yell, 'Throw her in,

315
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:05,667
'pointing at me,
'we'll do it.'

316
00:12:05,731 --> 00:12:09,611
Ahh, smart guys.

317
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:12,047
So what's new here?

318
00:12:12,104 --> 00:12:13,276
Nothing, really.

319
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:15,114
Just the same old, same old,
looking after cash flow,

320
00:12:15,174 --> 00:12:18,178
you know.

321
00:12:18,244 --> 00:12:19,655
You guys haven't
been by the casino,

322
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:21,123
trying to help it, have you?

323
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,124
No.

324
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:26,391

wouldn't, didn't I?

325
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:29,558
Just asking,
Matt, just asking.

326
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:32,728
Well, I am
just telling you.

327
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:35,432
Good.

328
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:37,030
Oh, I can't wait to get
out of this uniform

329
00:12:37,096 --> 00:12:38,404
and take a shower

330
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:40,000
And I can't
wait for that either.

331
00:12:53,946 --> 00:12:56,153
Oh, guess what
the big rumor is at work.

332
00:12:56,215 --> 00:12:58,491
Southwest buying
you out, that one?

333
00:12:58,551 --> 00:13:01,157
They're going to be
offering an early retirement.

334
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,756
Retirement?

335
00:13:02,822 --> 00:13:03,766
For you?

336
00:13:03,823 --> 00:13:05,928
You're too young and
sexy to be retired.

337
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:13,774
With a cash incentive,
twenty-some thousand.

338
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,835
Twenty thousand?

339
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:17,312
Of course, I can't even
think about it until your

340
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:22,786
business does something,
we pay down our cards.

341
00:13:22,842 --> 00:13:25,789
I don't think you'll
be waiting too much longer.

342
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:28,086
It's like Thomas Edison
said, "To have a great idea,

343
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:30,252
you've got to have
a lot of them."

344
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:32,592
Yeah, but while we're
waiting on that light bulb,

345
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:34,632
we're getting in
deeper and deeper.

346
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:35,927
Come on.

347
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:41,404
Every bad idea I have just
gets us closer, and closer,

348
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:51,245
and closer to a really,
really, really good idea.

349
00:13:51,304 --> 00:13:53,443
Oh, I've got a
really good idea.

350
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:54,814
I've been
up since six, baby.

351
00:13:54,874 --> 00:14:01,450
I've been up about
a minute and a half.

352
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:06,514
<i>J")</i>

353
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:35,158
So I said, 'Care
for a calzone, sir?'

354
00:14:35,214 --> 00:14:37,558
And he, real
uppity-like goes, 'Miss,

355
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:38,924
you don't know what
you're serving.

356
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:39,826
I'm italian

357
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:41,626
It's pronounced calzon-e.

358
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:43,360
You emphasize the 'e'.

359
00:14:43,422 --> 00:14:45,663
If you're going to serve it,
learn how to pronounce it.'

360
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:47,898
I just moved the
cart on up the aisle.

361
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,304
Yeah, sister...

362
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:51,603
Exactly.

363
00:14:51,664 --> 00:14:53,234
Then my friend Rita, who's on
the other side of the cart,

364
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:56,542
leans back and
says, 'Hey, Gina,

365
00:14:56,602 --> 00:15:03,577
would that be
asshole or asshol-e?

366
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:07,385
You're not real into it.

367
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:08,447
Another round?

368
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:11,495
I'd be really good
after a few of these.

369
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,358
<i>L</i> think it's great you
guys have been friends

370
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:13,624
since high school.

371
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:15,324
I don't even
know that guy.

372
00:15:15,388 --> 00:15:17,459
I could tell
you some stories.

373
00:15:17,523 --> 00:15:19,002
Please don't say
anything, come on, man.

374
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:21,095
Gina, you know, she still
thinks I'm a nice guy.

375
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,230
No, I don't

376
00:15:22,294 --> 00:15:24,331
I knew you were an asshole
the minute I met you.

377
00:15:24,397 --> 00:15:25,705
I don't have
to pretend anything.

378
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:26,835
No, you don't, baby.

379
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,210
No pretending.

380
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:44,345
I'm really glad
we're all together.

381
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:52,701
So anyways, thank
you, dickhead.

382
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:54,032
Sure, buddy.

383
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:56,004
G, you know that Cinda's
going to be coming with us to

384
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:57,540
the expo, you know that?

385
00:15:57,596 --> 00:15:58,597
Oh, really?

386
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:02,077
Fill out orders,
you know the ropes.

387
00:16:02,134 --> 00:16:03,135
That's right.

388
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:05,978
I don't know the first
thing about the watches.

389
00:16:06,038 --> 00:16:07,779
Babe, you don't have to.

390
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,820
All you got to do is be
a goddess like you are,

391
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:10,945
a big smile.

392
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,182
You know what I mean?

393
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:13,086
And say, 'It's animated!'

394
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:15,421
It's animated!

395
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:16,926
Not like that
like we practiced.

396
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:18,052
Like you did it.

397
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:20,290
Hey, excuse me.

398
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:21,194
You want to win a
million dollars

399
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:24,496
with the touch of a button?

400
00:16:24,557 --> 00:16:25,433
I do..

401
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:26,265
Push the button.

402
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:27,599
It's animated!

403
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,003
Like that!

404
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:29,766
I'll buy one, fight?

405
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:30,671
Come on!

406
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:31,469
Seriously!

407
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,838
I'll buy three.

408
00:16:32,898 --> 00:16:34,400
I keep telling Gina
when the money rolls in,

409
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:36,310
she's gonna' wonder where
it's been all this time.

410
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:37,779
When can I
start wondering?

411
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:39,316
Next week, sister, when
we start selling

412
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:40,782
a trillion watches.

413
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,511
Really?

414
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:42,211
That's right.

415
00:16:42,274 --> 00:16:43,582
Quit your goddamn job!

416
00:16:43,642 --> 00:16:44,950
Yeah, I'm
gonna' quit, okay?

417
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,045
Sam says I can.

418
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:47,613
Can do, sister!

419
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,954
YOU can do ill

420
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:50,049
Can Do.

421
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:53,392
Can Do, the dog.

422
00:16:53,452 --> 00:16:57,229
What dog?

423
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:59,792
Dog?

424
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:04,205
We were selling
the dog watches.

425
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:06,675
Am I missing something?

426
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:09,770
Have you heard
Sam's dog shit theory?

427
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:11,280
We're trying to eat.

428
00:17:11,337 --> 00:17:12,247
We're eating, no one
wants to hear about it.

429
00:17:12,304 --> 00:17:13,282
No, no,
it's hilarious.

430
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,649
They were at the dog
track last week...

431
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,382
Hey,

432
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:20,048
You were
at the dog track?

433
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:21,318
Did you go?

434
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,825
No, I went.

435
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:24,054
You didn't go.

436
00:17:24,116 --> 00:17:27,962
I went with Bartender Carl,
and dominated, by the way.

437
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,091
Salsa?

438
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:35,696
It's delicious.

439
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:39,573
(3?

440
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,419
That's great.

441
00:17:51,477 --> 00:17:52,581
I'm really
sorry, honey.

442
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:53,953
No, it's my fault.

443
00:18:01,353 --> 00:18:04,357
Gina.

444
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:08,064
How stupid can I be?

445
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:13,099
I'm picking up extra trips to
pay down our credit cards,

446
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:14,303
and you're here gambling.

447
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:15,470
I know, I know.

448
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:17,036
It isn't fair.

449
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:21,608
Listen, we were just trying
to get more money

450
00:18:21,674 --> 00:18:22,744
so we could fund...

451
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:24,014
If I hear that
excuse one more time,

452
00:18:24,076 --> 00:18:25,384
I'm gonna' scream.

453
00:18:25,444 --> 00:18:27,890
I'm gonna'
quit for good.

454
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:29,927
You said
that two weeks ago,

455
00:18:29,982 --> 00:18:35,022
and a couple of months before
that, and a year before that.

456
00:18:35,087 --> 00:18:44,838
It's getting to be a joke.

457
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:48,140
Gina, listen.

458
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,578
The way we figure it, sixty
million people

459
00:18:50,636 --> 00:18:52,582
play the lottery.

460
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:54,242
If I can sell one
percent, I mean,

461
00:18:54,306 --> 00:18:59,085
that is one out of a hundred,
that's sixty thousand watches!

462
00:18:59,144 --> 00:19:02,318
That's you taking
early retirement.

463
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:04,088
That's a down
payment on our house.

464
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:05,127
That's...

465
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:08,131
I hope it's a
huge hit, I really do.

466
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:13,159
But if you ever
gamble again...

467
00:19:32,141 --> 00:19:33,484
Don't blame Cinda, man.

468
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,317
<i>Blame me. me.</i>

469
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:37,482
I do blame you.

470
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:39,355
I swore I told
her not to say anything.

471
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:44,125
Yeah, just don't
worry about it, man.

472
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:49,795
So was it a long ride
to the airport this morning?

473
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:51,838
Yeah, the old
silent treatment

474
00:19:51,894 --> 00:19:53,874
I used to look forward
to those with Rhonda,

475
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:54,771
actually instigate them.

476
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,740
You think I talk a lot, man?

477
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:59,302
Jesus..

478
00:19:59,368 --> 00:20:01,541
Gina giving you a hard time
about having to fly so much?

479
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:03,583
<i>I</i> wouldn't
blame her if she did.

480
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:06,085
Withholding sex yet?

481
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:07,119
No.

482
00:20:07,176 --> 00:20:08,655
It's the only entertainment
we can afford.

483
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:09,781
But you know what? That's
a good thing, buddy,

484
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:11,188
because that's the
last thing to go.

485
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:12,657
Old Rhonda, towards the end
of that train wreck of a

486
00:20:12,715 --> 00:20:14,388
marriage, she'd
tell me, 'Sam, no!

487
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,554
I'm mid-month.

488
00:20:15,617 --> 00:20:16,391
I'm bloated.

489
00:20:16,452 --> 00:20:17,294
I don't want you
to look at me.'

490
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:17,888
I don't want to look at you!

491
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:19,591
I want to fuck you!'

492
00:20:19,655 --> 00:20:21,066
What a psycho, man.

493
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:22,193
Right?

494
00:20:22,257 --> 00:20:23,634
Rhonda.

495
00:20:23,692 --> 00:20:25,603
Liar's Poker for the tab.

496
00:20:25,661 --> 00:20:28,505
Oh, well, can't very
well turn down free beer,

497
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:29,668
can I?

498
00:20:29,732 --> 00:20:31,075
Hey, fuck you, man.

499
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:32,669
Loser's first.

500
00:20:32,735 --> 00:20:33,611
Okay, I'll go anyway.

501
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:37,776
Yeah.

502
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,114
Three fours, my friend.

503
00:20:39,174 --> 00:20:40,118
Yeah?

504
00:20:40,175 --> 00:20:40,983
That's not going to do it.

505
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:43,455
Four sixes.

506
00:20:43,512 --> 00:20:46,584
Oh, it's there, don't worry.

507
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:47,854
Five sixes.

508
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,259
Good God,
you're terrible!

509
00:20:49,318 --> 00:20:49,853
Keep in

510
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:51,488
Keep in

511
00:20:51,553 --> 00:20:52,361
Keep in

512
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:52,990
God, I don't like
this stupid game!

513
00:20:53,055 --> 00:20:53,931
Who made that up anyway?

514
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:54,763
Hey, Carl!

515
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:56,325
Two more on Sammy.

516
00:20:56,392 --> 00:20:57,097
Yeah.

517
00:20:59,628 --> 00:21:02,336
The thing is, America
is the place where a little

518
00:21:02,398 --> 00:21:04,400
guy can have a big idea.

519
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:07,345
Anybody can do it, come
up with bubble wrap,

520
00:21:07,403 --> 00:21:09,747
a super soaker,
a lottery watch.

521
00:21:09,805 --> 00:21:10,783
A million dollars

522
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,682
You gotta' see in

523
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:13,651
It's animated!

524
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:15,746
One idea can
change everything.

525
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:17,484
All it takes is one.

526
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:19,150
Check it out.

527
00:21:19,214 --> 00:21:20,557
It's gonna' change every time.

528
00:21:20,616 --> 00:21:22,289
How do you feel about
winning some cash?

529
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:23,227
<i>L</i> feel good about it.

530
00:21:23,285 --> 00:21:24,263
LETS do this, all right?

531
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:24,888
Come on.

532
00:21:24,953 --> 00:21:26,330
All right.

533
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:27,389
Check it out.

534
00:21:27,456 --> 00:21:31,302
Check out this
great new watch.

535
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,737
Hey, how are
you doing, buddy?

536
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:34,138
Lucky Lottery Watch, how
do you feel about it?

537
00:21:34,196 --> 00:21:34,765
No?

538
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,036
Come on now.

539
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:37,668
Hey, I know
you like the lottery.

540
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:39,440
Check it out, a new way
to play the lottery!

541
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:41,344
oh, yeah.

542
00:21:41,403 --> 00:21:42,245
More than two shakes,
you're playing with it.

543
00:21:42,304 --> 00:21:43,840
You know what I'm saying?

544
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:44,976
I've got the
dress, I've got the smile.

545
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,018
It's animated.

546
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:46,643
I need a drink.

547
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,413
It's animated.

548
00:21:47,476 --> 00:21:48,318
It's not working.

549
00:21:48,377 --> 00:21:50,618
Tell me about it.

550
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:52,590
What is this, kid?

551
00:21:52,648 --> 00:21:53,683
What is this?

552
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:55,251
Is this a Lab, or
is this a Retriever?

553
00:21:55,317 --> 00:21:56,193
That is a Lab.

554
00:21:56,251 --> 00:21:57,696
It's one of our best sellers.

555
00:21:57,753 --> 00:21:59,630
It's cute, very cute.

556
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:01,793
Listen, who makes the business
decisions for this company?

557
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:02,858
That would be me.

558
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:04,199
MEN Reeder.

559
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:04,964
Hey,
Matt, how are you?

560
00:22:05,027 --> 00:22:05,869
How can I help you?

561
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:06,872
Oh, no, no.

562
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:09,535
The question is,
how can I help you?

563
00:22:09,598 --> 00:22:10,941
See, my company is the leader

564
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:12,945
in TV direct response
advertising.

565
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:14,537
What we'd like to
do is stop by...

566
00:22:14,603 --> 00:22:16,048
We're not doing any
advertising right now.

567
00:22:16,104 --> 00:22:17,674
Wait, wait, wait.

568
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:19,150
It's a whole new concept.

569
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,243
We pay you.

570
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:22,550
Okay, we're
really busy here, so...

571
00:22:22,611 --> 00:22:23,385
Listen, I
picked up a brochure,

572
00:22:23,445 --> 00:22:24,150
so I'll give you a call later.

573
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:25,715
I'll explain what we do, okay?

574
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:27,055
Come to the office
and we'll talk.

575
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:30,255
We're really
not interested.

576
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,391
You're not
interested in making money?

577
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:36,095
Listen, I'll give you a call.

578
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:38,502
I think you'll like what
I have to say, okay?

579
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,870
Maybe I can get you
some customers, right?

580
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:42,806
Huh?

581
00:22:42,865 --> 00:22:44,538
Customers are nice.

582
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,944
Nice to see you.

583
00:22:47,002 --> 00:22:50,176
Fucking queer.

584
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:53,448
Who's that asshole?

585
00:23:03,852 --> 00:23:05,889
You know, I mean, I
wouldn't call it a dud.

586
00:23:05,954 --> 00:23:07,627
I'd call if <i>3</i> start.

587
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:10,192
Sam, use
some common sense.

588
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:12,500
I mean, look, I'm as
disappointed as you are.

589
00:23:12,561 --> 00:23:14,939
That's fine.

590
00:23:14,997 --> 00:23:16,408
Hey, look, maybe that's
the problem, buddy.

591
00:23:16,465 --> 00:23:18,138
I don't know, maybe there's
just too much fucking common

592
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,178
sense around here!

593
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:21,214
Let's, I don't know,
shake it up a little bit!

594
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,079
Let's think outside the box!

595
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:26,984
ORB)'-

596
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:28,077
All right, I got it.

597
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:29,121
Here's one.

598
00:23:29,177 --> 00:23:30,815
Get a little publicity.

599
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:32,916
Find a lucky lottery winner,
and say we pay him a couple

600
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:35,985
grand, I don't know, to say
that they got their numbers

601
00:23:36,051 --> 00:23:37,223
off of our watch.

602
00:23:37,286 --> 00:23:38,560
They go on TV.

603
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,497
They say to the entire world,

604
00:23:40,556 --> 00:23:43,400
'I got the numbers off of this
watch'

605
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,460
Sam, will you
listen to yourself.

606
00:23:45,527 --> 00:23:47,302
They just won the lottery.

607
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:48,340
Why are they going to lie for
us for

608
00:23:48,397 --> 00:23:50,536
a couple of thousand bucks?

609
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,942
I don't know, man.

610
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,172
I'm just throwing
it out there.

611
00:23:53,235 --> 00:23:54,805
And that's assuming we have a
couple of thousand bucks.

612
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,281
Yeah, we're
delinquent on everything,

613
00:23:56,338 --> 00:23:58,181
and withholding is right
around the corner.

614
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,446
Okay, here we
go, small thinker.

615
00:23:59,508 --> 00:24:01,215
What?

616
00:24:01,276 --> 00:24:02,152
Underachiever.

617
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,280
Okay, we gotta'
figure this out,

618
00:24:03,345 --> 00:24:05,256
unless you want to be
pounding nails again.

619
00:24:05,314 --> 00:24:06,520
All right, well, I'm the
only one coming up with some

620
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:07,560
ideas.

621
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:08,617
Anyone else want
to chime in here?

622
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:09,924
Here's an idea.

623
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:12,022
We could've done four or five
breeds of the dog watch for

624
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:14,397
what we wasted at that expo!

625
00:24:14,456 --> 00:24:15,833
But we didn't,
did we, Bean?

626
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:17,097
The highest re-order
rate of any product

627
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,263
we've ever had, ever

628
00:24:18,327 --> 00:24:19,863
You know what, I want to
fucking choke you sometimes!

629
00:24:19,928 --> 00:24:21,066
J$$LI$'l

630
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:22,733
Goddammit, Bean, you're really
starting to piss me off!

631
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:25,972
Hey, hey, you are
starting to piss me off, okay?

632
00:24:26,034 --> 00:24:28,640
FUCK!

633
00:24:28,704 --> 00:24:31,310
Come on, amigo.

634
00:24:31,373 --> 00:24:32,750
He?" he)', hey, man.

635
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:42,559
Come on, come on.

636
00:24:42,618 --> 00:24:47,033
Okay, let's go see
the bank manager.

637
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:48,466
With Our
financial statement?

638
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:50,127
Don't be ridiculous.

639
00:24:50,192 --> 00:24:51,830
No, we'll just go to him
without all the negative shit

640
00:24:51,893 --> 00:24:53,099
On it.

641
00:24:53,161 --> 00:24:55,368
I hope you're kidding,
because that's bank fraud!

642
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,034
I can never tell
with you anymore.

643
00:24:57,099 --> 00:24:58,476
Yes, Bean,
he's kidding.

644
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:00,774
Because
I won't sign it!

645
00:25:00,836 --> 00:25:02,747
Bean, he's kidding.

646
00:25:02,804 --> 00:25:10,689
Bean!

647
00:25:10,746 --> 00:25:12,851
Look, we're on
the same team, right?

648
00:25:12,914 --> 00:25:18,592
I need you, man.

649
00:25:18,654 --> 00:25:22,693
I say whatever it takes.

650
00:25:22,758 --> 00:25:25,898
I don't know what that is.

651
00:25:25,961 --> 00:25:33,470
Whatever it takes.

652
00:25:33,535 --> 00:25:35,845
Sam and I are
essentially out of business.

653
00:25:35,904 --> 00:25:37,975
I didn't know
it was that bad.

654
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,316
I mean, we got enough
money for one maybe two

655
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:43,185
payrolls, and that's it.

656
00:25:43,245 --> 00:25:45,282
You know, maybe
it's for the best.

657
00:25:45,347 --> 00:25:48,021
Go to work for Louisa, and get
away from Sam and his schemes

658
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:50,495
before you end up in jail.

659
00:25:50,552 --> 00:25:52,259
I kind of like you, I
don't want you in jail.

660
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,561
Well, you know, a
problem is

661
00:25:54,623 --> 00:25:56,261
an opportunity in disguise.

662
00:25:56,324 --> 00:26:00,602
I mean, every store who buys
the dog watch sells out.

663
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:06,374
We just need more breeds.

664
00:26:06,902 --> 00:26:11,902
Could you get a loan
from your credit union?

665
00:26:17,713 --> 00:26:18,817
No, Mam

666
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:26,799
NOT

667
00:26:26,855 --> 00:26:28,835
Gina...

668
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,425
No, Matt!

669
00:26:29,491 --> 00:26:30,993
NOT

670
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:32,265
I mean, how many failed
products have you had lately?

671
00:26:32,327 --> 00:26:34,136
That stupid jogger TV hat
I tried to talk you out of?

672
00:26:34,196 --> 00:26:37,268
Watch TV while you jog?

673
00:26:37,332 --> 00:26:40,211
The ten second toothbrush
for people in a hurry?

674
00:26:40,268 --> 00:26:41,076
Come on, Matt!

675
00:26:41,136 --> 00:26:42,137
Yeah, that was stupid

676
00:26:42,204 --> 00:26:43,376
but this is completely
different.

677
00:26:43,438 --> 00:26:44,473
It is night and day.

678
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:48,043
Every store that bought
the dog watch sold out!

679
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,647
I need more breeds
to get more accounts.

680
00:26:50,712 --> 00:26:53,955
Gina, this can work, trust me.

681
00:26:54,015 --> 00:26:57,189
This can work.

682
00:26:57,252 --> 00:26:59,664
Say it doesn't
sell for any reason.

683
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:03,430
Would you promise to
go to work for Louisa?

684
00:27:03,492 --> 00:27:05,199
Look, it's
a proven product.

685
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,364
We've sold these!

686
00:27:06,428 --> 00:27:08,874
Just answer
the question, Matt.

687
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,843
Say it doesn't sell, would
you go to work for Louisa?

688
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,345
Look, you ever hear
about what happens to pro

689
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:15,278
athletes when they sign
their first contract?

690
00:27:15,337 --> 00:27:16,475
What's that got
to do with anything?

691
00:27:16,538 --> 00:27:18,211
Suddenly, here comes
the family with their hands

692
00:27:18,273 --> 00:27:19,752
<i>out, 'Gimme, gimme'.</i>

693
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:20,912
I mean, that's how I'm
going to feel

694
00:27:20,976 --> 00:27:22,455
working for your sister.

695
00:27:22,511 --> 00:27:25,515
Well,
you'd get over it!

696
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:28,392
Al, I'm a
happily married woman.

697
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:31,734
No, no, no.

698
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:33,670
Just what I needed,
another success seminar

699
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:36,141
with my in-laws.

700
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:39,304
A guy in a bar told me once,
if you want to know what God

701
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:43,407
thinks about money, look
at who he gives it to.

702
00:27:43,472 --> 00:27:45,145
Al, I love
you, you know that.

703
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:46,311
I'd do anything for you.

704
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,183
Absolutely.

705
00:27:47,242 --> 00:27:47,879
Okay, true.

706
00:27:47,943 --> 00:27:48,819
Matt, another beer?

707
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:49,912
Yeah.

708
00:27:49,978 --> 00:27:50,649
But first, get
me that signature, Okay?

709
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:51,690
Get me that signature today.

710
00:27:51,747 --> 00:27:52,350
ORB)'-

711
00:27:52,414 --> 00:27:53,324
Ciao.

712
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:54,122
Al, stop
flirting with my wife.

713
00:27:54,182 --> 00:27:55,183
We've got guests.

714
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,126
Oh, God,
I need a drink.

715
00:27:56,184 --> 00:27:57,094
Now, now, now!

716
00:27:57,152 --> 00:27:57,857
Coming right up.

717
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,796
I've got one ready.

718
00:27:58,854 --> 00:27:59,628
I'm so
sorry I'm so late.

719
00:27:59,688 --> 00:28:02,100
So sorry.

720
00:28:02,157 --> 00:28:03,363
Here you go, my love.

721
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:06,565
Oh, thank you.

722
00:28:06,628 --> 00:28:08,869
What do you think?

723
00:28:08,931 --> 00:28:12,174
Thank you,
you wonderful man.

724
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:13,804
As long as you know.

725
00:28:13,869 --> 00:28:14,313
I'm good.

726
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:15,347
I'm good.

727
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:17,077
So, it's so
good to see you guys.

728
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:18,140
You are good.

729
00:28:18,206 --> 00:28:19,184
So, Matt,
what do you want? Medium rare?

730
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:19,912
Did you get
my message last week?

731
00:28:19,975 --> 00:28:20,851
Yes, please.

732
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,445
I was in
Boise and Sacramento.

733
00:28:22,511 --> 00:28:24,218
Oh, world traveler.

734
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,485
Well, guess what.

735
00:28:25,547 --> 00:28:28,721
The week before Christmas,
you two are coming with us to

736
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:29,626
Telluride.

737
00:28:29,685 --> 00:28:31,687
Telluride.

738
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:32,527
Yeah.

739
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:33,589
We won the winning donation.

740
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:35,532
At the Lupus
Charity Auction.

741
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:37,036
Fourteen grand, huh?

742
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:38,594
For a disease, I
still don't know

743
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,196
what the hell it is.

744
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:42,606
But it got us a four bedroom
condo right on the slopes

745
00:28:42,664 --> 00:28:43,836
for a week.

746
00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:46,277
Yeah, you ski right in,
ski right out your front door.

747
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:50,442
We thought of you guys the
second we got it, huh?

748
00:28:50,505 --> 00:28:51,984
Well?

749
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,077
There's no way we can
afford Telluride for a week.

750
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:54,950
Oh, come on!

751
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,045
It's all paid fort

752
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,089
Yeah, but the
skiing, the restaurants...

753
00:28:57,145 --> 00:28:58,123
Oh!

754
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,853
Live a little, have
some fun for a change.

755
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:02,486
You guys have got to stop
worrying about money.

756
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:04,497
So how's business?

757
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:06,897
Could be
better, you know.

758
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,798
I have an office and a
desk could have

759
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:10,097
your name on it.

760
00:29:10,158 --> 00:29:11,432
I mean, anytime you
want, no pressure.

761
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:14,474
There is a hot rock
massage that'll make you wet,

762
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:16,031
and I don't mean sweat

763
00:29:16,098 --> 00:29:18,977
What do you think?

764
00:29:19,034 --> 00:29:20,877
Oh, seriously, Matt.

765
00:29:20,936 --> 00:29:22,916
Do you know what we
call real estate?

766
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:26,350
Steal estate!

767
00:29:26,408 --> 00:29:29,787
Stop throwing
your money away on rent.

768
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:31,916
Yeah, you can get my
little sister the casita

769
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:37,726
she's always wanted.

770
00:29:37,786 --> 00:29:40,198
A little more wine?

771
00:29:40,255 --> 00:29:40,892
You too, hun?

772
00:29:40,956 --> 00:29:43,596
No, no, I'm good.

773
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:45,002
Seven thousand,
that's amazing!

774
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,667
Her credit union has a
formula based on her salary.

775
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,368
Just be glad she got
the loan she did.

776
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:53,311
But seven grand,
that's...no, that's amazing.

777
00:29:53,368 --> 00:29:55,041
Never mind, I should shut up.

778
00:29:55,103 --> 00:29:57,276
You know, it's three
more breeds, right?

779
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:58,943
We have the Lab.

780
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,350
We should do the Retriever,
the German Shepherd

781
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:01,319
and the Beagle.

782
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:02,719
It's better
than one Lab.

783
00:30:02,778 --> 00:30:04,018
But not really, man.

784
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,922
I mean, everybody I talk to
wants the top ten or nothing,

785
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:07,016
right?

786
00:30:07,082 --> 00:30:08,026
They don't want to piss
off the Boxer people,

787
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,061
the Poodle people, blah, blah.

788
00:30:09,117 --> 00:30:10,061
I know.

789
00:30:10,118 --> 00:30:12,598
Look, man, just be
satisfied, all right?

790
00:30:12,654 --> 00:30:21,574
It's a good thing.

791
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,768
You know
what we're good at?

792
00:30:22,831 --> 00:30:24,367
Lately not a whole lot.

793
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:26,344
A little bit
of Bj my friend.

794
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:27,812
Now, let's head to
that reservation.

795
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,348
No, listen.

796
00:30:29,404 --> 00:30:30,280
Oh, come on,
you are a real asshole.

797
00:30:30,338 --> 00:30:31,373
No, listen to
me, listen to me.

798
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,113
Okay, look, we want to
do three breeds, right?

799
00:30:33,175 --> 00:30:36,122
That's nineteen hundred each,
that's fifty-seven hundred.

800
00:30:36,178 --> 00:30:38,715
We have thirteen hundred
to play with, right?

801
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,123
Now, we hit a few
hands we have.

802
00:30:40,182 --> 00:30:41,252
What is this and this?

803
00:30:41,316 --> 00:30:43,728
That's a stack o' black, Okay?

804
00:30:43,785 --> 00:30:45,628
You pull that in, what
do we got here, cowboy?

805
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:46,597
That's a nest egg!

806
00:30:46,655 --> 00:30:48,100
That's twelve grand!

807
00:30:48,156 --> 00:30:50,102
That's the top ten
breeds, my friend!

808
00:30:50,158 --> 00:30:53,605
That is the difference between
walking out of a store with an

809
00:30:53,662 --> 00:30:54,732
order for ten
dozen instead of...

810
00:30:54,796 --> 00:30:55,900
Three dozen.

811
00:30:55,964 --> 00:30:57,534
But Gina, she gave us that
money, all of that money,

812
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,873
for watches.

813
00:30:58,934 --> 00:31:00,845
Yes, but she would want
us to protect this investment,

814
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,074
wouldn't she?

815
00:31:02,137 --> 00:31:03,275
Okay, look at it this way.

816
00:31:03,338 --> 00:31:04,942
We lose that thirteen hundred
dollars, which we won't,

817
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:06,076
because we dominate.

818
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:07,347
Say we do.

819
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:10,117
We still have the fifty-seven
hundred left to do the top

820
00:31:10,178 --> 00:31:12,522
three bl'$$Cl$.

821
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:13,958
We do dominate
at blackjack.

822
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:19,328
Yes, We do.

823
00:31:19,387 --> 00:31:19,922
Lift Off.

824
00:31:19,988 --> 00:31:22,969
Yes, We can.

825
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,606
Goddamn!

826
00:31:36,671 --> 00:31:38,514
Get my man some
French caviar, hun.

827
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:51,288
Here we go again!

828
00:31:51,353 --> 00:31:52,127
I'm not afraid.

829
00:31:52,187 --> 00:31:55,930
I ain't afraid.

830
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:57,197
Eights.

831
00:31:57,259 --> 00:31:58,863
We got to.

832
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:01,806
Do the math!

833
00:32:01,863 --> 00:32:04,537
Oh, it's
gonna' be good.

834
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:07,102
Do it again?

835
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:08,113
Twenty-four thousand!

836
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,708
Oh, do it again!

837
00:32:11,773 --> 00:32:13,946
Do it again!

838
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:14,851
Put it all in, baby!

839
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,786
We're all good!

840
00:32:15,844 --> 00:32:17,050
All right,
he's got a Six!

841
00:32:17,112 --> 00:32:20,525
Unbelievable!

842
00:32:44,873 --> 00:32:47,251
Seven thousand dollars.

843
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:49,016
Dealer's sitting on
a sixteen, hits a five?

844
00:32:49,077 --> 00:32:53,822
It's unbelievable!

845
00:32:56,885 --> 00:33:00,833
What happened?

846
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:01,731
We out of gas?

847
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,291
What?

848
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:03,165
I can't go home.

849
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:07,765
What?

850
00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:12,829
NO! Until
I figure this out.

851
00:33:20,976 --> 00:33:26,449
All right.

852
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:30,051
Insurance fire.

853
00:33:30,118 --> 00:33:30,960
Insurance fire!

854
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:32,930
Let's just torch
all of our watches.

855
00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:34,262
Is that so wrong?

856
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:35,767
It's win-win!

857
00:33:35,824 --> 00:33:37,565
Newkin.

858
00:33:37,626 --> 00:33:38,366
New what?

859
00:33:38,426 --> 00:33:38,961
Who?

860
00:33:39,027 --> 00:33:40,005
Newkin.

861
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,233
The guy, do you remember?

862
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:43,776
The guy from the booth, said
he'd put the watches on TV

863
00:33:43,832 --> 00:33:45,470
and give us a percentage.

864
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:46,773
I don't know, man.

865
00:33:46,835 --> 00:33:47,404
The knock-off king?

866
00:33:47,469 --> 00:33:48,345
No.

867
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:49,643
What do you mean,
the knock-off king?

868
00:33:49,704 --> 00:33:51,308
Yeah, man, all the guys
in the next booth said that

869
00:33:51,373 --> 00:33:53,751
that guy lurches around
all the trade shows to rip

870
00:33:53,808 --> 00:33:55,082
people's ideas off.

871
00:33:55,143 --> 00:33:55,644
Forget in

872
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,211
Fuck him!

873
00:33:56,278 --> 00:33:56,813
No.

874
00:33:56,878 --> 00:33:57,822
I doubt it.

875
00:33:57,879 --> 00:33:59,825
The guy runs a huge company.

876
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:02,725
He's got ads on major
cable all the time.

877
00:34:02,784 --> 00:34:05,321
God, imagine how
many he could sell.

878
00:34:05,387 --> 00:34:07,367
Sixty-four million dog owners.

879
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:09,424
Remember Bean's stat, four out
of five of them write their

880
00:34:09,491 --> 00:34:11,562
pet's names on greeting cards.

881
00:34:11,626 --> 00:34:13,401
Newkin can reach those people.

882
00:34:13,461 --> 00:34:14,462
You know what, buddy?

883
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:15,701
That's the reason why we
should do it on our own,

884
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:16,868
you know what I mean?

885
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:18,411
Why turn it over to some
cheese dick and end up with

886
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:19,911
nothing, man, and
get railroaded?

887
00:34:19,968 --> 00:34:23,575
No way!

888
00:34:23,638 --> 00:34:25,481
I don't trust a guy that
can eat his own fist, okay?

889
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,348
Call me crazy!

890
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:28,046
You see the chompers
on that guy?

891
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:29,110
Come on, man.

892
00:34:29,177 --> 00:34:30,451
You want to do business
with him, seriously?

893
00:34:30,512 --> 00:34:32,321
I'd like to
do business, Sam.

894
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,485
That's what I'd like IO do.

895
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,527
You boys are old
enough to remember this.

896
00:34:39,587 --> 00:34:42,830
This is one of the all
time TV products.

897
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:44,199
The chirping bird clock.

898
00:34:44,259 --> 00:34:46,796
How many of those
did you sell, if I can ask?

899
00:34:46,861 --> 00:34:47,896
Oh, Jesus.

900
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:49,704
MOM?

901
00:34:49,764 --> 00:34:56,648
We sold, 781 ,26O
clocks in 105 days.

902
00:34:56,705 --> 00:35:00,050
But wait, there's more!

903
00:35:00,108 --> 00:35:01,644
I love those
commercials, the guy...

904
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,018
Yeah, we're
very proud of that.

905
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:04,853
Now, those numbers
are just a start,

906
00:35:04,913 --> 00:35:07,018
because once you create
interest in a product on TV

907
00:35:07,082 --> 00:35:10,029
then you go
for the after market.

908
00:35:10,085 --> 00:35:12,691
Retail.

909
00:35:12,754 --> 00:35:16,099
We're sitting at the adult table
with Sears and Wal-Mart.

910
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:18,660
At the adult table,
Matthew, do you hear that?

911
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:21,264
With Sears and Wal-Mart.

912
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:22,672
if <i>I</i> may,

913
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:30,013
You see, it's animated, so you
can actually see

914
00:35:30,071 --> 00:35:31,641
what dogs dream about.

915
00:35:37,445 --> 00:35:40,085
Millions of dog
lovers out there, Larry.

916
00:35:40,148 --> 00:35:42,685
Our customer,
too, older female.

917
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:44,025
QVC?

918
00:35:44,085 --> 00:35:45,860
Come on, you get some has-been
celebrity on there with their

919
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,729
pet Corgi or something.

920
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:50,929
Could have a big upside.

921
00:35:50,992 --> 00:35:52,164
How many
breeds you got?

922
00:35:52,227 --> 00:35:53,604
Well, right now
it is just the one,

923
00:35:53,661 --> 00:35:57,541
but when we partner
with AmeriDirect,

924
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,842
the American Kennel
Club top twenty.

925
00:36:00,902 --> 00:36:02,609
All right.

926
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,844
If we pick you LIP, we
fund all the TV ads.

927
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:07,978
We handle inventory
management,

928
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:09,317
retail distribution.

929
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:10,321
All right.

930
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:10,947
ORB)'-

931
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:12,457
So, question, yeah.

932
00:36:12,514 --> 00:36:13,959
What's our cut?

933
00:36:14,015 --> 00:36:17,553
If we pick you
up, an untested product,

934
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:19,997
four percent.

935
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:23,502
How about a little
dinner before you fuck me?

936
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:25,231
Wow!

937
00:36:25,293 --> 00:36:26,067
Amazing!

938
00:36:26,127 --> 00:36:27,197
Untested product?

939
00:36:27,262 --> 00:36:28,832
Do you know how many of
those watches we've sold?

940
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:31,605
How many
have you sold on TV 7

941
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:34,146
Our volume is fifty, one
hundred times anything you can

942
00:36:34,202 --> 00:36:36,443
possibly produce, especially
with your

943
00:36:36,504 --> 00:36:38,142
limited financial capability.

944
00:36:38,206 --> 00:36:39,082
Oh, really?

945
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,141
And how do you know anything
about our

946
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:41,448
limited financial capability?

947
00:36:41,509 --> 00:36:42,886
We vetted
International Gifts.

948
00:36:42,944 --> 00:36:44,014
What?

949
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:44,989
What happened?

950
00:36:45,046 --> 00:36:46,252
We checked you out.

951
00:36:46,314 --> 00:36:46,917
What, I'm gonna' sit across
this table from two people I

952
00:36:46,981 --> 00:36:48,324
don't know shit about?

953
00:36:48,383 --> 00:36:49,088
What am I, stupid, huh?

954
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:49,719
That's debatable.

955
00:36:49,784 --> 00:36:50,592
I don't know.

956
00:36:50,652 --> 00:36:52,154
Well, you
guys have no money.

957
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,494
Why did you come
to see me, huh?

958
00:36:53,555 --> 00:36:55,330
Why are you sitting
in that chair, huh?

959
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,266
You answer me that!

960
00:36:56,324 --> 00:36:57,325
You know, I...

961
00:36:57,392 --> 00:36:58,427
I what?

962
00:36:58,493 --> 00:36:59,437
I what?

963
00:36:59,494 --> 00:37:00,598
Why did you come to see me?

964
00:37:00,662 --> 00:37:03,142
You tell him, tell
him why you came.

965
00:37:03,198 --> 00:37:05,838
Tell your little snot-nosed
friend why you came.

966
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,176
Because I can move
your merchandise.

967
00:37:08,236 --> 00:37:09,681
Well, that's
because you're the king.

968
00:37:09,737 --> 00:37:10,977
<i>L</i> am the king.

969
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:12,040
You are the
knock-off king!

970
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:14,747
All right,
young man, that's enough.

971
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:16,755
That's all.

972
00:37:16,811 --> 00:37:18,290
Not smart.

973
00:37:18,346 --> 00:37:21,088
You boys are out
of your league.

974
00:37:23,651 --> 00:37:26,598
What a goddamn prick!

975
00:37:26,654 --> 00:37:27,428
You're the prick.

976
00:37:27,489 --> 00:37:27,967
Really?

977
00:37:28,022 --> 00:37:28,830
Yeah.

978
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:29,561
I'm the prick?

979
00:37:29,624 --> 00:37:30,796
Yes.

980
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:31,837
Come on!

981
00:37:31,893 --> 00:37:32,667
We're not going to
bend over for this guy.

982
00:37:32,727 --> 00:37:36,732
We're gonna' do
it our own way.

983
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:40,109
I'm fucked.

984
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:55,573
You gave me your word.

985
00:37:55,631 --> 00:37:59,670
That money was going
to buy watches.

986
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,907
It was.

987
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:07,387
We just...Gina, I've been
trying to figure out a way to...

988
00:38:24,193 --> 00:38:30,542
Gina.

989
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,153
when I get
back from this trip,

990
00:38:42,211 --> 00:38:46,785
I'm moving into
Louisa's guest house.

991
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:50,422
I'm gonna' use
one of her cars.

992
00:38:50,486 --> 00:38:54,935
You can have the Chevy
to drive to work.

993
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,298
Gina, I...

994
00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:57,803
Or drive it
to a car lot

995
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,534
and sell it for gambling money.

996
00:39:00,596 --> 00:39:04,669
I don't care.

997
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:08,476
I'm thinking about
myself for a change.

998
00:39:08,537 --> 00:39:17,423
Like you do all the time.

999
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:22,895
Gina, can
we talk about it?

1000
00:39:22,952 --> 00:39:28,493
No. Don't touch me.

1001
00:39:28,557 --> 00:39:30,662
Gina?

1002
00:39:54,316 --> 00:39:58,628
<i>J")</i>

1003
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:03,227
What's going on, amigo?

1004
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:08,292
<i>J")</i>

1005
00:40:14,737 --> 00:40:17,718
This is sexy, it
doesn't look like you.

1006
00:40:17,773 --> 00:40:19,753
You've got some
very cute clothes.

1007
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:20,809
I've never seen these before.

1008
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,685
You should let me help
you make some outfits.

1009
00:40:22,745 --> 00:40:24,315
I could spruce it up a bit.

1010
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,324
I like them.

1011
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,190
And you sleep on these, okay?

1012
00:40:27,249 --> 00:40:30,059
These are for decor only.

1013
00:40:55,511 --> 00:41:02,292
How did it
ever come to this?

1014
00:41:02,351 --> 00:41:04,297
Unbelievable.

1015
00:41:11,493 --> 00:41:13,769
Did she call you back yet?

1016
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:15,866
No.

1017
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:21,381
L...l really did it this time.

1018
00:41:22,004 --> 00:41:23,608
I'm gonna' share
something with you that I

1019
00:41:23,672 --> 00:41:26,118
learned a long time ago.

1020
00:41:26,175 --> 00:41:28,883
WOMEN?

1021
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:33,188
They can't stay mad.

1022
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:37,594
They are emotionally
resilient creatures, man.

1023
00:41:37,653 --> 00:41:39,997
Impressive.

1024
00:41:40,055 --> 00:41:42,194
They're all fucking crazy!

1025
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:43,327
But they're resilient.

1026
00:41:43,392 --> 00:41:47,169
She'll be back
before you know it.

1027
00:41:47,229 --> 00:41:52,110
You know, buddy, and it's not
like you got caught cheating.

1028
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:53,339
You know what I mean?

1029
00:41:53,402 --> 00:41:55,814
That's a whole other twelve
miles of bad road and STDs

1030
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:56,645
you know what I mean?

1031
00:41:56,705 --> 00:41:58,912
But you can lie.

1032
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,352
You can forget anniversaries.

1033
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,947
You can get drunk, show your
ass in front of the in-laws.

1034
00:42:04,012 --> 00:42:06,356
That's all...they'll
forgive all that shit, man.

1035
00:42:06,415 --> 00:42:10,795
But do not, you can not
get caught cheating.

1036
00:42:10,853 --> 00:42:13,356
No, they don't like it.

1037
00:42:13,422 --> 00:42:15,698
It'll fuck you every
time, trust me.

1038
00:42:15,758 --> 00:42:19,706
So in about probably
twenty-six, twenty-seven days,

1039
00:42:19,762 --> 00:42:20,502
Gina will be back.

1040
00:42:20,562 --> 00:42:21,199
You want to bet on it?

1041
00:42:21,263 --> 00:42:23,436
<i>I'll</i> bet you on it.

1042
00:42:26,401 --> 00:42:30,440
Well, you guys have
been really great to work for.

1043
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,484
Bren.

1044
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,541
Oh, Bren.

1045
00:42:32,608 --> 00:42:33,712
You've been
really great as well.

1046
00:42:33,776 --> 00:42:36,882
I'm so sorry.

1047
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:37,753
No.

1048
00:42:37,813 --> 00:42:39,349
Yes, great.

1049
00:42:39,414 --> 00:42:44,227
So, what are
you guys going to do now?

1050
00:42:44,286 --> 00:42:49,286
<i>J")</i>

1051
00:43:26,695 --> 00:43:28,072
Well, listen,
think of the alternative.

1052
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:29,336
I mean, look at my ex-husband.

1053
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:33,175
Forty-seven years old, he's
got the dick of a teenager.

1054
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:38,378
At least Matt's faithful,
you got that going for you.

1055
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,817
I like you and Matt
together, you know?

1056
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:41,548
Please.

1057
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:42,281
No, stop.

1058
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:45,655
I've had it.

1059
00:43:45,714 --> 00:43:47,716
Has he always gambled?

1060
00:43:47,783 --> 00:43:49,057
Oh, please.

1061
00:43:49,117 --> 00:43:51,563
I met him on a Reno
turn, remember?

1062
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,531
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you told me that.

1063
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,001
Did I tell you that he
and Sam flipped a coin to see

1064
00:43:56,058 --> 00:43:57,537
who would ask me out?

1065
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:02,064
No, <i>I</i> don't
remember that.

1066
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:03,336
I should have run the
other way

1067
00:44:03,398 --> 00:44:08,370
as soon as i heard that.

1068
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,816
I really should have.

1069
00:44:32,361 --> 00:44:33,965
Attention dog lovers!

1070
00:44:34,029 --> 00:44:39,377
Now you can show your love for
your dog with the amazing...

...from AmeriDirect.

1072
00:44:40,769 --> 00:44:42,476
I always
wondered what he was thinking!

1073
00:44:42,537 --> 00:44:44,244
Using
breakthrough technology,

1074
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,809
The Dreaming Dog Watch

1075
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:47,910
dream about!

1076

Dog food, a bone,
a fire hydrant!

1077
00:44:51,213 --> 00:44:52,385
That's great!

1078
00:44:52,447 --> 00:44:53,357
Where can I get one?

1079
00:44:53,415 --> 00:44:54,257
Fuck me!

1080
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:57,786
Oh,
I got to have one.

1081
00:44:57,853 --> 00:45:00,390
Only $19-95, The
Dreaming Dog Watch...

1082
00:45:00,455 --> 00:45:02,958
I'm coming
around the bend.

1083
00:45:03,025 --> 00:45:05,198
Who's flexible?

1084
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,364
Who's a dancer?

1085
00:45:06,428 --> 00:45:06,997
Come on!

1086
00:45:07,062 --> 00:45:08,006
Yeah, that's me.

Yeah, you like
that, don't you?

1088
00:45:09,464 --> 00:45:10,499
It's me, pick up.

1089

Yo, what's LIP, buddy?

Turn on

of busy right now.

The remote!

You fucking...l
You...l You there?

1127
00:46:00,983 --> 00:46:02,018
So did you
have Mr. Newkin sign a

1128
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,957
non-disclosure agreement?

1129
00:46:03,015 --> 00:46:04,892
No, we didn't.

1130
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:07,624
You didn't?

1131
00:46:07,686 --> 00:46:08,790
Well, that's not essential.

1132
00:46:08,854 --> 00:46:11,664
By copying your
design exactly,

1133
00:46:11,724 --> 00:46:15,137
Mr. Newkin has exhibited
malice of forethought.

1134
00:46:15,194 --> 00:46:16,468
What? What does that mean?

1135
00:46:16,529 --> 00:46:19,806
Oh, sorry.
You have a case.

1136
00:46:19,865 --> 00:46:21,276
Hot damn.

1137
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:22,471
I told you, man.

1138
00:46:22,535 --> 00:46:23,570
Great.

1139
00:46:23,636 --> 00:46:25,172
How far are you
willing to go on this matter?

1140
00:46:25,237 --> 00:46:26,875
Like a virgin
on prom night, baby!

1141
00:46:26,939 --> 00:46:27,849
All the way!

1142
00:46:27,907 --> 00:46:29,011
Let's do this!

1143
00:46:29,074 --> 00:46:30,109
No, Sam, I don't think
that's the question

1144
00:46:30,176 --> 00:46:32,816
he's asking.

1145
00:46:32,878 --> 00:46:35,791
Would you be prepared to take
this on a contingency basis?

1146
00:46:36,482 --> 00:46:38,894
NO, I
couldn't do that.

1147
00:46:38,951 --> 00:46:40,487
But you
said we had a case.

1148
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,727
Yeah, but this type
of case can be protracted.

1149
00:46:42,788 --> 00:46:44,665
It can go on for a long time.

1150
00:46:44,723 --> 00:46:50,867
But I might consider going
with a contingent contingency.

1151
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:51,533
Good, I want in

1152
00:46:51,597 --> 00:46:52,007
I’m in!

1153
00:46:52,064 --> 00:46:53,008
What is it?

1154
00:46:53,065 --> 00:46:55,170
Contingent
contingency.

1155
00:46:55,234 --> 00:46:56,269
I'll write them a letter

1156
00:46:56,335 --> 00:46:58,110
If they respond
with a good offer,

1157
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,776
I'll take it on contingency.

1158
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:05,048
And <i>I</i> say to the
guy, I say, 'Sir, I'm sorry,

1159
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:08,580
but we do not have mints
or gum on this plane.'

1160
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:11,321
And he gives me this big
exasperated sigh, he says,

1161
00:47:11,383 --> 00:47:14,091
'Do you mean to tell me you do
not have one goddamn mint on

1162
00:47:14,153 --> 00:47:16,155
this entire plane?'

1163
00:47:16,222 --> 00:47:17,098
Smoker.

1164
00:47:17,156 --> 00:47:18,066
Yeah, definitely.

1165
00:47:18,123 --> 00:47:19,898
And a jerk.

1166
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:22,098
So Gina, come
outwith us

1167
00:47:22,161 --> 00:47:23,799
when we get to Portland.

1168
00:47:23,863 --> 00:47:25,001
No, thanks, Randall.

1169
00:47:25,064 --> 00:47:27,374
I'm just gonna'
order room service

1170
00:47:27,433 --> 00:47:30,243
and take a long hot bath.

1171
00:47:30,302 --> 00:47:31,508
I know what
you're going through.

1172
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:33,174
It's not easy.

1173
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:34,217
Tell you what.

1174
00:47:34,273 --> 00:47:36,048
<i>I'll</i> bring up a really
good bottle of wine,

1175
00:47:36,108 --> 00:47:38,884
and give you a massage.

1176
00:47:38,944 --> 00:47:40,787
Have you ever had
a Shiatsu before?

1177
00:47:40,846 --> 00:47:45,056
I mean like deep
tissue, just really...

1178
00:47:45,117 --> 00:47:46,391
emotions just float out.

1179
00:47:46,452 --> 00:47:48,625
The first time I ever
had one, I cried.

1180
00:47:48,687 --> 00:47:49,495
Thanks.

1181
00:47:49,555 --> 00:47:51,057
Yeah, it's
good, it lets it out

1182
00:47:51,123 --> 00:47:52,158
Have you ever had one?

1183
00:47:52,224 --> 00:47:53,100
No, Randall.

1184
00:47:53,158 --> 00:47:55,570
Sit back.

1185
00:47:55,628 --> 00:47:57,699
Just trying to help.

1186
00:48:06,605 --> 00:48:08,414
Poor girl.

1187
00:48:12,077 --> 00:48:14,614
A cowboy
philosopher once told me,

1188
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,822
'If you find yourself in
a hole, stop digging.'

1189
00:48:26,525 --> 00:48:28,300
This is bullshit.

1190
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,169
I know about
these things, bro.

1191
00:48:30,229 --> 00:48:32,038
They turn you into
feeling like a

1192
00:48:32,097 --> 00:48:34,043
fucking plucked chicken.

1193
00:48:34,099 --> 00:48:35,635
I didn't
ask you to some.

1194
00:48:35,701 --> 00:48:37,339
Okay, guys,
let's get started.

1195
00:48:37,403 --> 00:48:38,711
If you're going to
be a dick, just leave now.

1196
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:42,685
I'm just saying,
it's not even legitimate.

1197
00:48:45,277 --> 00:48:48,884
Hey, good crowd.

1198
00:48:48,948 --> 00:48:50,757
It's all fucking
propaganda if you ask me.

1199
00:48:50,816 --> 00:48:52,853
We're all here
for the same reason.

1200
00:48:52,918 --> 00:48:55,694
Our lives have gone
out of control.

1201
00:48:55,754 --> 00:49:01,602
We all wanted to be big
shots, be rich, powerful,

1202
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,230
but without the effort.

1203
00:49:03,295 --> 00:49:05,275
A something for nothing
approach to life.

1204
00:49:05,331 --> 00:49:09,279
Sounds good to me.

1205
00:49:09,335 --> 00:49:13,044
My name is Kelly, and
I'm a compulsive gambler.

1206
00:49:13,105 --> 00:49:16,177
Hi, Kelly.

1207
00:49:17,009 --> 00:49:18,386
My name is Glenda,

1208
00:49:18,444 --> 00:49:20,424
and I'm a compulsive gambler.

1209
00:49:20,479 --> 00:49:26,452
Hi, Glenda.

1210
00:49:26,518 --> 00:49:30,364
My name is Matt, and
I have a gambling problem.

1211
00:49:30,422 --> 00:49:35,394
Hi, Matt.

1212
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,218
Hi, it's me,
Louisa.

1213
00:49:56,281 --> 00:49:58,352
I signed you up for the real
estate exam next month.

1214
00:49:58,417 --> 00:50:03,025
I hope you're
serious about this.

1215
00:50:03,956 --> 00:50:05,629
HEY-

1216
00:50:05,691 --> 00:50:10,902
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm sending you a check

1217
00:50:10,963 --> 00:50:14,035
for the payment to
your credit union.

1218
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:19,099
And, well, when you feel
like talking...I'll see you.

1219
00:50:50,302 --> 00:50:53,476
I kept telling myself
something Edison said:

1220
00:50:53,539 --> 00:50:55,416
'A lot of people don't
realize how close

1221
00:50:55,474 --> 00:51:00,355
they are to success
when they give up.'

1222
00:51:18,864 --> 00:51:22,402
The combo, man.

1223
00:51:22,468 --> 00:51:23,776
The shooter.

1224
00:51:27,639 --> 00:51:32,554
So did Newkin's lawyer
end up saying forget it?

1225
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:35,057
Yeah.

1226
00:51:35,114 --> 00:51:36,388
Potentially.

1227
00:51:36,448 --> 00:51:38,121
I mean, it starts out the way
'Thank you so

1228
00:51:38,183 --> 00:51:41,130
much for bringing this
to our attention, but...'

1229
00:51:41,186 --> 00:51:42,187
Go fuck yourself, right?

1230
00:51:42,254 --> 00:51:44,393
Right,

1231
00:51:44,456 --> 00:51:46,436
Say good night, Sammy.

1232
00:51:46,492 --> 00:51:48,062
Good shot, man.

1233
00:51:55,367 --> 00:52:00,441
You sell any LA-Z-
BOYS lately?

1234
00:52:00,506 --> 00:52:05,012
I am in danger of
being employee of the month.

1235
00:52:05,077 --> 00:52:07,921
That's good.

1236
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,722
Well, I'm asshole of the day.

1237
00:52:10,782 --> 00:52:12,420
I think I could get
used to working there,

1238
00:52:12,484 --> 00:52:16,296
and then wake up suddenly
twenty years from now...

1239
00:52:16,355 --> 00:52:17,925
Oh, please stop
talking about it,

1240
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:22,803
that scares the
shit out of me.

1241
00:52:22,861 --> 00:52:25,501
Am I gonna' end
up some pathetic,

1242
00:52:25,564 --> 00:52:29,808
lonely sixty-year-old framer?

1243
00:52:33,972 --> 00:52:34,882
Hey, guys.

1244
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,477
Like another one?

1245
00:52:37,543 --> 00:52:38,578
Can't hurt.

1246
00:52:38,644 --> 00:52:41,124
Okay.

1247
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:45,094
Ice cold ones coming up.

1248
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:47,494
oh, yeah.

1249
00:52:47,553 --> 00:52:48,827
It's time for a beer.

1250
00:52:48,887 --> 00:52:57,238
Thank you, man.

1251
00:52:57,296 --> 00:52:58,900
I'm gonna' go
drop the kids off.

1252
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,878
oh, yeah.

1253
00:53:09,942 --> 00:53:11,944
It's time for a beer.

1254
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,261
Yeah.

1255
00:53:29,328 --> 00:53:32,969
Hold on, Mr. Chow, it's
coming in right now.

1256
00:53:35,534 --> 00:53:37,275
ORB)'-

1257
00:53:37,336 --> 00:53:37,939
Right.

1258
00:53:38,003 --> 00:53:39,539
No battery compartment.

1259
00:53:39,605 --> 00:53:40,811
That's gonna' be a
problem.

1260
00:53:40,872 --> 00:53:42,579
We need room for
the circuit board.

1261
00:53:42,641 --> 00:53:43,881
Well, it is too bulky.

1262
00:53:43,942 --> 00:53:45,751
Yeah, I know
it looks bad, but...

1263
00:53:45,811 --> 00:53:47,381
Yeah, well, get
your engineers on it,

1264
00:53:47,446 --> 00:53:49,858
see if you can, I don't know,
reduce the circuit board.

1265
00:53:49,915 --> 00:53:51,917
We'll try.
I'll send you a fax.

1266
00:53:51,984 --> 00:53:53,463
Okay. Tonight, yeah?

1267
00:53:53,518 --> 00:53:54,462
We'll try.

1268
00:53:54,519 --> 00:53:56,465
Excellent. And no buttons.

1269
00:53:56,521 --> 00:54:01,521
<i>J")</i>

1270
00:54:14,906 --> 00:54:15,941
Oh, yeah!

1271
00:54:16,008 --> 00:54:17,453
Time for a beer!

1272
00:54:27,282 --> 00:54:30,820
Hey!

1273
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,894
Where's the fire?

1274
00:54:32,954 --> 00:54:33,694
You all right?

1275
00:54:33,755 --> 00:54:35,894
Yeah, I'm great.

1276
00:54:35,957 --> 00:54:37,129
Jesus, man!

1277
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:38,102
Let me ask
you a question.

1278
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:39,433
Yeah?

1279
00:54:39,494 --> 00:54:41,633
We, together, have run
our business into the ground,

1280
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:44,643
my wife left me, we're
working shit jobs,

1281
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:47,043
we're completely broke, and
we're approaching middle age.

1282
00:54:47,102 --> 00:54:50,106
It's reason to be depressed,
wouldn't you think?

1283
00:54:50,171 --> 00:54:51,809
Do I look depressed?

1284
00:54:51,873 --> 00:54:52,544
I don't know.

1285
00:54:52,607 --> 00:54:54,280
Look! Do I look depressed?

1286
00:54:54,342 --> 00:54:55,548
Is this <i>3</i>
trick question?

1287
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:57,521
Bro, we've been
friends for twenty years.

1288
00:54:57,579 --> 00:54:59,217
We've been through
a lot of shit.

1289
00:54:59,281 --> 00:55:01,989
But I'm telling you, man, we
are on the verge

1290
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:05,725
of living the dream!

1291
00:55:05,787 --> 00:55:06,788
All right, look.

1292
00:55:06,855 --> 00:55:09,768
Sammy's here, everything's
gonna' be okay.

1293
00:55:09,824 --> 00:55:10,427
Hugs?

1294
00:55:10,492 --> 00:55:11,027
You need hugs?

1295
00:55:11,092 --> 00:55:12,036
Come on, it's Okay.

1296
00:55:12,093 --> 00:55:12,662
No, you know,
I don't need a hug.

1297
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:13,205
You know what I do need?

1298
00:55:13,261 --> 00:55:13,864
What's that?

1299
00:55:13,928 --> 00:55:14,998
I need a beer.

1300
00:55:15,063 --> 00:55:15,734
I like beer.

1301
00:55:15,797 --> 00:55:16,901
Do you like beer?

1302
00:55:16,965 --> 00:55:17,739
Let's have a beer.

1303
00:55:17,799 --> 00:55:18,402
Why don't you
get us some beer.

1304
00:55:18,466 --> 00:55:18,910
ORB)'-

1305
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:19,570
All right.

1306
00:55:19,634 --> 00:55:20,237
I'll get you a beer.

1307
00:55:20,302 --> 00:55:21,940
All right.

1308
00:55:22,337 --> 00:55:25,511
You're
acting weird, man.

1309
00:55:26,941 --> 00:55:28,716
Unbelievable.

1310
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:33,726
Oh, is there not
an opener over there?

1311
00:55:33,782 --> 00:55:34,726
That's too bad.

1312
00:55:34,783 --> 00:55:37,423
I flaked.

1313
00:55:37,485 --> 00:55:40,125
Hey, why
don't you try this.

1314
00:55:40,188 --> 00:55:41,690
You sure you're
all right, man?

1315
00:55:41,756 --> 00:55:43,667
You seem crazy.

1316
00:55:43,725 --> 00:55:46,604
I feel like I should be
concerned about you.

1317
00:55:46,661 --> 00:55:48,402
Oh,
yes! I like beer!

1318
00:55:52,834 --> 00:55:56,611
Oh, yes! I like beer!

1319
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,548
Wait a minute.

1320
00:56:01,343 --> 00:56:03,755
Where'd you get this?

1321
00:56:03,812 --> 00:56:07,851
Where do you think?

1322
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:09,759
You son a bitch.

1323
00:56:09,818 --> 00:56:10,626
How much?

1324
00:56:10,685 --> 00:56:13,461
Six ninety-five retail.

1325
00:56:13,521 --> 00:56:14,727
Well, it
sounds amazing, man!

1326
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:15,494
It's an
automatic sound.

1327
00:56:15,557 --> 00:56:16,627
There's no buttons.

1328
00:56:16,691 --> 00:56:17,499
But the best thing
about it is it surprises you!

1329
00:56:17,559 --> 00:56:18,629
It's a total surprise!

1330
00:56:18,693 --> 00:56:19,535
What's the minimum?

1331
00:56:19,594 --> 00:56:20,504
Five thousand units.

1332
00:56:20,562 --> 00:56:22,132
Oh, shit.

1333
00:56:22,197 --> 00:56:23,073
I can sell that in a week!

1334
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:24,474
Bro, this is it!

1335
00:56:24,532 --> 00:56:25,533
"'5 "19 one!

1336
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,079
This is a chain store product!

1337
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,877
This goes everywhere, man!

1338
00:56:29,938 --> 00:56:31,849
Jesus Christ!

1339
00:56:31,906 --> 00:56:32,941
And hey, you know what?

1340
00:56:33,007 --> 00:56:35,009
this
little thing right here,

1341
00:56:35,076 --> 00:56:36,578
this is gonna' get
you Gina back, man.

1342
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:37,679
Maybe.

1343
00:56:37,746 --> 00:56:38,622
If I can repay her.

1344
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,455
Oh, I promise you that.

1345
00:56:40,515 --> 00:56:42,290
We gotta' get this out before
Newkin prick-ass

1346
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:43,454
gets a hold of it, right?

1347
00:56:43,518 --> 00:56:44,826
Oh, Newkin's not
gonna' find out about this!

1348
00:56:44,886 --> 00:56:46,866
We introduce it at
the L.A. Gift Expo.

1349
00:56:46,921 --> 00:56:47,991
L.A. Gift Show, right!

1350
00:56:48,056 --> 00:56:48,659
You know what I mean?

1351
00:56:48,723 --> 00:56:49,565
We'll kill Newkin!

1352
00:56:49,624 --> 00:56:50,728
And hey, look at me!

1353
00:56:50,792 --> 00:56:52,430
I'm gonna' get the money
for this, somehow some way!

1354
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:54,838
I just spent the rent
money on this prototype.

1355
00:56:54,896 --> 00:56:55,897
Yeah, well, I got it.

1356
00:56:55,964 --> 00:56:57,705
I don't care
where, I'll get it.

1357
00:56:57,766 --> 00:56:59,939
Oh,
yes! I like beer!

1358
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:00,536
Oh, yes!

1359
00:57:00,602 --> 00:57:03,344
I like beer!

1360
00:57:29,898 --> 00:57:30,706
Hey-

1361
00:57:30,765 --> 00:57:34,838
How are you?

1362
00:57:34,903 --> 00:57:37,179
You look great.

1363
00:57:37,238 --> 00:57:38,740
You, too.

1364
00:57:38,807 --> 00:57:39,842
How are you, Sam?

1365
00:57:39,908 --> 00:57:41,080
What's going on?

1366
00:57:41,142 --> 00:57:46,455
Well, I'm...summer
time, right?

1367
00:57:46,514 --> 00:57:50,690
Pounding nails in the desert,
that sucks man.

1368
00:57:50,752 --> 00:57:52,288
Something to drink?

1369
00:57:52,353 --> 00:57:56,495
Just water, please.

1370
00:57:56,558 --> 00:58:00,870
So, did
you talk to Matt?

1371
00:58:00,929 --> 00:58:02,374
You know, he's
doing all right.

1372
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:06,640
He's doing his thing.

1373
00:58:06,701 --> 00:58:10,171
But my idea man is reduced to
selling furniture

1374
00:58:10,238 --> 00:58:13,412
in a strip mall.

1375
00:58:13,475 --> 00:58:17,685
Sam, is that
why you called,

1376
00:58:17,745 --> 00:58:22,524
to tell me you're
worried about Matt?

1377
00:58:22,584 --> 00:58:26,896
Well, look, I
know he fucked up, okay?

1378
00:58:26,955 --> 00:58:29,663
But don't we all,
right, you, me?

1379
00:58:29,724 --> 00:58:32,432
I mean, you should just be
happy that Matt won that coin

1380
00:58:32,494 --> 00:58:34,997
toss instead of me, because
I am the train wreck.

1381
00:58:35,063 --> 00:58:38,772
I am the fuck up, right?

1382
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:40,904
I mean, you should just call
him, and say,

1383
00:58:40,969 --> 00:58:43,973
'Hey, Matt, how are you doing?'

1384
00:58:44,038 --> 00:58:45,210
And he'd say, 'Oh,
Gina, you know,

1385
00:58:45,273 --> 00:58:48,880
I've been doing a
little bit Of this,

1386
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:50,980
a little bi! Of that.'

1387
00:58:56,284 --> 00:59:00,164
Try it.

1388
00:59:01,589 --> 00:59:06,470
Oh,
yes! I like beer!

1389
00:59:06,528 --> 00:59:07,768
Did Matt
come up with this?

1390
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:08,739
Yeah.

1391
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:09,900
How's he do it?

1392
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:11,136
Oh, you
know, it's simple.

1393
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:13,076
I think it has to do with like
the metal and the...yeah,

1394
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:14,772
I have no idea.

1395
00:59:14,836 --> 00:59:23,881
But Gina, this is the
one, I'm telling you.

1396
00:59:23,945 --> 00:59:29,827
So we've been talking
to some investors and...

1397
00:59:29,884 --> 00:59:31,989
I just thought maybe your
sister Louisa

1398
00:59:32,053 --> 00:59:36,934
might be interested.

1399
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:38,766
Did Matt ask
you to...?

1400
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:41,739
No, he doesn't know
I'm here..

1401
00:59:41,796 --> 00:59:44,606
Was this his idea?

1402
00:59:44,666 --> 00:59:47,078
No, that would be mine.

1403
00:59:47,135 --> 00:59:51,948
Yeah, you know, call me crazy,
but she likes to make money.

1404
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:53,349
She wouldn't
touch this, Sam.

1405
00:59:53,408 --> 00:59:54,352
No?

1406
00:59:54,409 --> 00:59:58,414
No. Trust me. Listen, I
got to get going.

1407
00:59:58,479 --> 01:00:01,221
I've got an early check-in and
I haven't packed yet, so...

1408
01:00:01,282 --> 01:00:02,317
All right.

1409
01:00:02,383 --> 01:00:03,259
I got it, <i>I</i> got ac.

1410
01:00:03,318 --> 01:00:03,796
<i>L</i> got it.

1411
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:05,888
It's fine.

1412
01:00:05,954 --> 01:00:07,627
We've got a
big show coming up,

1413
01:00:07,689 --> 01:00:10,101
so...normally I would
never ask this, you know.

1414
01:00:10,158 --> 01:00:11,603
I'd never...it's just
that, you know...

1415
01:00:11,659 --> 01:00:13,104
Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam!

1416
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:14,003
She wouldn't do it.

1417
01:00:14,062 --> 01:00:14,767
No?

1418
01:00:14,829 --> 01:00:15,432
Take care, man.

1419
01:00:15,496 --> 01:00:16,372
All right.

1420
01:00:16,431 --> 01:00:18,001
Hey, come on, give
me a hug at least!

1421
01:00:21,269 --> 01:00:26,048
Good to see you.

1422
01:00:26,107 --> 01:00:28,986
You look gorgeous.

1423
01:00:30,178 --> 01:00:31,350
I loved Sam
like a brother,

1424
01:00:31,412 --> 01:00:33,756
but he drives me crazy.

1425
01:00:33,815 --> 01:00:36,056
You never knew what he was
going to say or do next.

1426
01:00:36,117 --> 01:00:38,063
There wasn't a thought that
entered his head that didn't

1427
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:40,258
come straight
out of his mouth.

1428
01:00:40,321 --> 01:00:43,495
He acts on every scheme, and
to hell with the consequences.

1429
01:00:44,792 --> 01:00:46,203
What the fuck?

1430
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,968
This is how we
get Gina's money back.

1431
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:50,202
Sam, is it drugs?

1432
01:00:50,264 --> 01:00:51,402
Yes, it's drugs.

1433
01:00:51,466 --> 01:00:52,536
No, it's not fucking drugs.

1434
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:56,241
How stupid do you think I am?

1435
01:00:56,304 --> 01:00:58,716
All right, this is it.

1436
01:00:58,773 --> 01:01:00,650
ORB)'-

1437
01:01:02,243 --> 01:01:04,314
You know, every once in a
while an opportunity presents

1438
01:01:04,379 --> 01:01:06,518
itself right under our nose.

1439
01:01:06,581 --> 01:01:08,959
We just have to reach
out there and grab them!

1440
01:01:09,017 --> 01:01:09,927
You're acting
weird, brother.

1441
01:01:09,984 --> 01:01:11,258
No, don't
worry about that.

1442
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:13,629
The bartender Carl, he's
got this buddy, J.J.

1443
01:01:13,688 --> 01:01:16,692
Now, J.J., he's been going out
to the desert and he's been

1444
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:22,231
making an absolute
fortune swiping saguaros.

1445
01:01:22,296 --> 01:01:24,674
Okay, we're getting our
seed money

1446
01:01:24,732 --> 01:01:26,370
from committing a felony.

1447
01:01:26,434 --> 01:01:27,344
It's a felony!

1448
01:01:27,402 --> 01:01:28,608
No, no, not really, man.

1449
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:30,013
You see, because
he's got a permit,

1450
01:01:30,071 --> 01:01:32,483
and he goes and gets prickly
pears and the barrel cactuses,

1451
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:34,577
and he swipes, you know,
a few saguaros, man.

1452
01:01:34,642 --> 01:01:36,383
Now, these things go for
eight hundred dollars a foot,

1453
01:01:36,444 --> 01:01:37,980
and then these arms,
these go for four hundred.

1454
01:01:38,046 --> 01:01:39,616
$0 this is like
ten, twenty grand!

1455
01:01:39,681 --> 01:01:41,661
It's like
two, three tons!

1456
01:01:41,716 --> 01:01:44,822
What do you think
you're doing?

1457
01:01:44,886 --> 01:01:46,763
Okay, where did
you get all this?

1458
01:01:46,821 --> 01:01:50,769
Here's a shovel.

1459
01:01:50,825 --> 01:01:52,827
Look at the
size of that thing!

1460
01:01:52,894 --> 01:01:54,965
Let's do this.

1461
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:56,531
A four
hundred-year-old plant

1462
01:01:56,597 --> 01:01:57,541
you're going to chop down?

1463
01:01:57,598 --> 01:01:58,474
That no one's
gonna' miss, buddy.

1464
01:01:58,533 --> 01:02:01,070
Fifty yards off
the goddamn I-191

1465
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:02,546
Come on, let's
get out of here.

1466
01:02:02,603 --> 01:02:04,446
The Border Patrol is
gonna' be by, seriously.

1467
01:02:04,505 --> 01:02:07,884
Come on, I
need your help!

1468
01:02:07,942 --> 01:02:09,717
FUCK!

1469
01:02:09,777 --> 01:02:10,482
Look at yourself!

1470
01:02:10,545 --> 01:02:11,455
You're a cactus thief!

1471
01:02:11,512 --> 01:02:12,820
You're a fucking cactus thief!

1472
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,018
Hello?

1473
01:02:14,082 --> 01:02:17,859
Grab your fucking
shovel and help me dig, man!

1474
01:02:17,919 --> 01:02:18,897
Come on, man.

1475
01:02:18,953 --> 01:02:20,398
We're desperate, we're
not this desperate!

1476
01:02:20,455 --> 01:02:22,264
<i>Come on, man!</i>

1477
01:02:22,323 --> 01:02:23,961
Just calm
down for a second.

1478
01:02:24,025 --> 01:02:25,834
Come on, bastard!

1479
01:02:25,893 --> 01:02:27,395
Come on!

1480
01:02:27,462 --> 01:02:32,462
FUCK!

1481
01:02:38,306 --> 01:02:39,284
This is it, man.

1482
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,410
I mean, I got nothing.

1483
01:02:40,475 --> 01:02:43,115
You know
that's not true.

1484
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:46,090
Come on, we've been worse.

1485
01:02:46,147 --> 01:02:48,457
Somethings gonna'...we're
gonna' figure this out, man,

1486
01:02:48,516 --> 01:02:53,465
and it ain't gonna'
be with this cactus.

1487
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:55,967
All right.

1488
01:02:59,127 --> 01:03:01,300
There you go.

1489
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:08,917
That's nuts!

1490
01:03:08,976 --> 01:03:10,478
It's nuts!

1491
01:03:10,544 --> 01:03:12,820
And you just reached in there
and all of a sudden there was

1492
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,984
this talking...

1493
01:03:14,048 --> 01:03:16,654
Beer opener.

1494
01:03:16,717 --> 01:03:17,787
I want to show Tom.

1495
01:03:17,851 --> 01:03:18,522
No, no, I'm gonna' show...

1496
01:03:18,585 --> 01:03:19,620
No, Rita,
it's a secret!

1497
01:03:19,686 --> 01:03:20,630
A secret!

1498
01:03:20,687 --> 01:03:23,634
Tom, check it out.

1499
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:25,067
What is it?

1500
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:26,968
Oh,
yes! I like beer!

1501
01:03:27,027 --> 01:03:30,167
How cool is that?

1502
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:31,868
Hey, I have got
to get one of these.

1503
01:03:31,932 --> 01:03:33,138
Where can I get one?

1504
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,339
I've got an Air Force buddy
who would just flip for this.

1505
01:03:35,402 --> 01:03:39,407
Yeah, my husband
invented it, so...

1506
01:03:39,473 --> 01:03:41,510
I thought you
two were separated?

1507
01:03:41,575 --> 01:03:44,078
We are.

1508
01:03:45,312 --> 01:03:47,815
I think people grow up
with an idea about what their

1509
01:03:47,881 --> 01:03:51,328
life is going to be, and it's
hard to break out of that.

1510
01:03:51,385 --> 01:03:55,834
All it takes is
a little faith.

1511
01:03:55,889 --> 01:03:59,359
It's like when the Wizard
gave the Scarecrow a diploma.

1512
01:03:59,426 --> 01:04:02,464
It completely changed the
Scarecrow's idea of himself,

1513
01:04:02,529 --> 01:04:06,443
and he was able to do things
he never thought he could do.

1514
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,309
Your last flight.

1515
01:04:08,368 --> 01:04:09,244
I'm jealous.

1516
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:12,307
I know. It's a
little scary.

1517
01:04:12,372 --> 01:04:14,613
You think you're
gonna' like real estate?

1518
01:04:14,675 --> 01:04:19,124
Well, if I can
get past the paperwork,

1519
01:04:19,179 --> 01:04:21,682
and Louisa being
a control freak.

1520
01:04:21,748 --> 01:04:23,318
Oh, yeah.

1521
01:04:23,383 --> 01:04:24,919
Well, I think you're gonna'
be pretty good at it.

1522
01:04:24,985 --> 01:04:30,901
I mean, people warm up to you.

1523
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:32,995
I'm going to miss
buddy-bidding with you, kiddo.

1524
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:37,600
Don't start now.

1525
01:04:37,664 --> 01:04:39,200
Come down to
scheduling with me.

1526
01:04:39,266 --> 01:04:41,337
I want to check
on my trip trade.

1527
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:48,313
Surprise!

1528
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:53,375
<i>J")</i>

1529
01:05:00,254 --> 01:05:02,325
Mike!

1530
01:05:02,389 --> 01:05:03,925
Bridget!

1531
01:05:03,991 --> 01:05:09,703
Good luck.

1532
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,910
And we were
just going to talk.

1533
01:05:56,977 --> 01:06:01,977
Well, I'm so
glad to have you back.

1534
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:20,341
I'm not
ready to come back.

1535
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,471
Well, you
could've fooled me.

1536
01:06:22,536 --> 01:06:24,846
I mean, what's...

1537
01:06:24,905 --> 01:06:27,215
I know it doesn't
make sense, but...

1538
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:46,328
Could you call Sam and
see what he's doing tonight?

1539
01:06:46,393 --> 01:06:52,275
There's something I'd like
to go over with you guys.

1540
01:06:52,332 --> 01:06:53,811
You came up with it.

1541
01:06:53,867 --> 01:06:55,403
I might say it, but
you said it too, once.

1542
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:56,539
You would say it again
and again and again with each

1543
01:06:56,603 --> 01:06:58,446
product, 'This is the one
we've been waiting on.'

1544
01:06:58,505 --> 01:06:59,313
Okay, maybe.

1545
01:06:59,373 --> 01:06:59,714
Maybe.

1546
01:06:59,773 --> 01:07:00,183
<i>Yes</i>

1547
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,241
See?

1548
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:02,878
So anyway, who cares? What's the
point, right?

1549
01:07:02,943 --> 01:07:07,255
The point is that I
think this is the one

1550
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:11,592
you guys have been
waiting on.

1551
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:12,790
Really??

1552
01:07:12,853 --> 01:07:14,730
I showed it around
our union meeting last week,

1553
01:07:14,788 --> 01:07:19,237
and everybody,
everybody wanted one.

1554
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,369
You show it
to your sister?

1555
01:07:22,429 --> 01:07:23,407
I did.

1556
01:07:23,463 --> 01:07:23,964
Yeah?

1557
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,169
And?

1558
01:07:25,232 --> 01:07:27,644
She said no.

1559
01:07:27,701 --> 01:07:30,944
God!

1560
01:07:31,004 --> 01:07:32,745
And she's gonna' freak
when she finds out

1561
01:07:32,806 --> 01:07:37,380
what I've done, but let her.

1562
01:07:37,444 --> 01:07:41,950
I'm going to pay for
the opening order.

1563
01:07:42,015 --> 01:07:44,518
That's your
retirement money.

1564
01:07:44,584 --> 01:07:46,962
I know, Matt, but I
think this is an opportunity.

1565
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,693
Listen,
Gina, it's really...

1566
01:07:48,755 --> 01:07:50,166
Whoa, whoa, will
you shut up for a second?

1567
01:07:50,223 --> 01:07:52,066
Can't you see what she's
really trying to do here?

1568
01:07:52,125 --> 01:07:53,536
I mean, I can see it.

1569
01:07:53,593 --> 01:07:55,368
She's trying to get a
fresh start for you guys.

1570
01:07:55,429 --> 01:07:56,464
That's what it is, right?

1571
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:58,601
Sam, this is business.

1572
01:07:58,665 --> 01:08:00,042
on.

1573
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:00,737
Well, who cares?

1574
01:08:00,801 --> 01:08:01,779
I don't care.

1575
01:08:01,835 --> 01:08:02,711
Cut it.

1576
01:08:02,769 --> 01:08:03,509
I'm in!

1577
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:04,310
Thank you.

1578
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:06,908
Don't thank me yet.

1579
01:08:06,973 --> 01:08:11,973
So, the opening order, plus
sixty-four hundred additional

1580
01:08:18,485 --> 01:08:22,956
to pay Bean what you
owe him, and rehire him.

1581
01:08:23,023 --> 01:08:24,559
And he controls the checkbook.

1582
01:08:24,624 --> 01:08:25,398
Yes.

1583
01:08:25,459 --> 01:08:27,063
Of course.

1584
01:08:27,127 --> 01:08:28,071
Yeah, it's fine by me.

1585
01:08:28,128 --> 01:08:29,436
Okay.

1586
01:08:29,496 --> 01:08:30,474
The other thing is...

1587
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:32,100
And?

1588
01:08:32,165 --> 01:08:37,444
I want one-third
of the profits.

1589
01:08:39,373 --> 01:08:41,876
The early-out bonus isn't
enough for a house,

1590
01:08:41,942 --> 01:08:48,120
and I'm not sure I'm
cut out for real estate.

1591
01:08:48,181 --> 01:08:49,285
Yeah.

1592
01:08:49,349 --> 01:08:52,660
That's fine with me.

1593
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,824
A third?

1594
01:08:54,888 --> 01:08:57,164
JESUS.

1595
01:08:57,224 --> 01:08:59,830
What happens if you
guys get back together?

1596
01:08:59,893 --> 01:09:00,496
That's two-thirds!

1597
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,836
I'm getting railroaded!

1598
01:09:02,896 --> 01:09:04,170
Still a third.

1599
01:09:04,231 --> 01:09:06,006
Okay, Gina.

1600
01:09:06,066 --> 01:09:07,170
You're shrewd, all right.

1601
01:09:07,234 --> 01:09:09,111
ORB)'-

1602
01:09:09,169 --> 01:09:12,150
I'm thinking of a number here,
I'm gonna' throw it out there.

1603
01:09:12,205 --> 01:09:15,778
Forty, forty, twenty.
How about it?

1604
01:09:15,842 --> 01:09:16,912
A third.

1605
01:09:16,977 --> 01:09:20,049
Think about it.
Twenty-five. How about it?

1606
01:09:20,113 --> 01:09:21,387
Look at me. It's a good deal.

1607
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:23,724
A third.

1608
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:26,924
Thirty-three point
three, three, three.

1609
01:09:26,987 --> 01:09:27,658
All right, fuck it!

1610
01:09:27,721 --> 01:09:28,358
Who cares, man?

1611
01:09:28,422 --> 01:09:29,696
Let's do this!

1612
01:09:29,756 --> 01:09:31,827
There's enough money to
go around for all of us!

1613
01:09:31,892 --> 01:09:32,893
What the hell am I thinking?

1614
01:09:32,959 --> 01:09:33,733
Amen.

1615
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:34,795
Right?

1616
01:09:34,861 --> 01:09:36,272
I mean, this is amazing!

1617
01:09:36,329 --> 01:09:38,400
I love you guys!

1618
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:41,446
Okay, Dave, let
me set the scene for you.

1619
01:09:41,501 --> 01:09:42,206
All right.

1620
01:09:42,269 --> 01:09:43,942
You just
got home from work.

1621
01:09:44,004 --> 01:09:45,608
You're heading in the house,
and you head straight for the

1622
01:09:45,672 --> 01:09:47,948
refrigerator, open
the door, and...

1623
01:09:48,008 --> 01:09:50,079
Oh, yeah!

1624
01:09:50,143 --> 01:09:53,056
Time for a beer!

1625
01:09:53,113 --> 01:09:56,390
This time...the only
reason you go to work in the

1626
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:59,090
morning is to get to this
moment with the beer at night.

1627
01:09:59,152 --> 01:10:00,688
Yeah, baby.

1628
01:10:00,754 --> 01:10:01,562
Oh, yeah!

1629
01:10:01,621 --> 01:10:03,567
Time for a beer!

1630
01:10:03,623 --> 01:10:04,727
That's it. That's good.

1631
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:06,498
That's it.

1632
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,095
Cool.

1633
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:07,695
You're amazing.

1634
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:09,138
Thank you.

1635
01:10:09,196 --> 01:10:12,109
Maybe try it with a
chuckle on the 'Oh, yeah!'

1636
01:10:12,165 --> 01:10:13,701
Okay, sure.

1637
01:10:13,767 --> 01:10:15,041
Take two,
The Talking Beer Opener?

1638
01:10:15,101 --> 01:10:15,579
YEP-

1639
01:10:15,635 --> 01:10:16,511
YEP-

1640
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:19,574
Oh, yeah!
Time for a beer!

1641
01:10:22,209 --> 01:10:25,554
Yeah!

1642
01:10:57,577 --> 01:10:58,521
Hello?

1643
01:10:58,578 --> 01:11:00,455
Hi, it's me.

1644
01:11:00,514 --> 01:11:01,356
Hey-

1645
01:11:01,414 --> 01:11:02,290
Any word
on the container?

1646
01:11:02,349 --> 01:11:04,761
Yeah, they're
still stuck in customs.

1647
01:11:04,818 --> 01:11:07,025
I'll call the steamship
company tomorrow.

1648
01:11:07,087 --> 01:11:09,590
I don't imagine it'll be
more than a couple of days.

1649
01:11:09,656 --> 01:11:13,365
Also, this flyer should
go out tonight, so...

1650
01:11:13,426 --> 01:11:14,996
It's really
all happening.

1651
01:11:15,061 --> 01:11:16,836
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1652
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:22,107
Listen, I've got to go.

1653
01:11:22,168 --> 01:11:23,442
Louisa's here, so..

1654
01:11:23,503 --> 01:11:27,883
All right, bye.

1655
01:11:27,941 --> 01:11:28,646
Matt?

1656
01:11:28,708 --> 01:11:29,618
Uh-huh.

1657
01:11:29,676 --> 01:11:30,211
Well?

1658
01:11:30,277 --> 01:11:31,347
Well what?

1659
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:33,687
Did you do what I said and
ask for your money back?

1660
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:36,057
Louisa,
you don't listen!

1661
01:11:36,116 --> 01:11:37,823
I told you, it's a done deal.

1662
01:11:37,884 --> 01:11:39,295
The container is
in Long Beach,

1663
01:11:39,352 --> 01:11:41,263
and next week we're
introducing the opener

1664
01:11:41,321 --> 01:11:43,028
at the L.A. Gift Expo.

1665
01:11:43,089 --> 01:11:44,500
You're so naive.

1666
01:11:44,558 --> 01:11:45,730
What do you know
about business?

1667
01:11:45,792 --> 01:11:48,136
What did you know about
real estate when you started?

1668
01:11:48,194 --> 01:11:49,366
You're blind!

1669
01:11:49,429 --> 01:11:52,239
You've been with him eight
years, and what do you have?

1670
01:11:52,299 --> 01:11:54,438
You're going to end
UP With nothing!

1671
01:11:54,501 --> 01:11:56,913
No house, no job, no money!

1672
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,142
Nothing!

1673
01:12:02,075 --> 01:12:04,817
This is my decision. Not Matt's,
not yours. Mine.

1674
01:12:10,016 --> 01:12:11,324
Stubborn!

1675
01:12:24,664 --> 01:12:27,406
This is gonna' bring us some
serious FU money, you guys.

1676
01:12:27,467 --> 01:12:28,810
You're damn right.

1677
01:12:28,868 --> 01:12:30,506
What's FU money?

1678
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:31,947
Fuck-you money.

1679
01:12:32,005 --> 01:12:33,507
Wouldn't that be FY?

1680
01:12:33,573 --> 01:12:36,315
FY, Bean.

1681
01:12:36,376 --> 01:12:37,320
Who needs a hug?

1682
01:12:37,377 --> 01:12:43,623
Come here.

1683
01:12:43,683 --> 01:12:44,889
Yeah!

1684
01:12:44,951 --> 01:12:46,988
One hundred and
eighty-four cartons.

1685
01:12:47,053 --> 01:12:48,396
Five thousand openers.

1686
01:12:48,455 --> 01:12:49,525
WOO-hoo!!

1687
01:12:49,589 --> 01:12:52,399
Hey, guys, what's
a Talking Beer Opener?

1688
01:12:52,459 --> 01:12:57,533
Allow my
assistant to demonstrate.

1689
01:12:57,597 --> 01:13:00,703
International
Gifts presents.

1690
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:01,905
What's it say?

1691
01:13:01,968 --> 01:13:06,417
The Talking Beer Opener.

1692
01:13:06,473 --> 01:13:07,816
Oh, yeah!

1693
01:13:07,874 --> 01:13:11,981
Time for a beer!

1694
01:13:12,045 --> 01:13:13,183
Oh,
that's pretty good!

1695
01:13:13,246 --> 01:13:14,953
I've never seen
that before, man!

1696
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:18,189
But why didn't you guys use a
man's voice like,

1697
01:13:18,251 --> 01:13:21,232
"Oh, yeah! Time for a beer!'

1698
01:13:21,287 --> 01:13:21,765
Yeah, really?

1699
01:13:21,821 --> 01:13:22,891
Really??

1700
01:13:22,956 --> 01:13:24,458
Oh, yeah!

1701
01:13:24,524 --> 01:13:25,502
Time for a beer!

1702
01:13:25,558 --> 01:13:26,093
Shit!

1703
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:27,900
Checking them!

1704
01:13:27,961 --> 01:13:29,099
Damn ill

1705
01:13:32,132 --> 01:13:33,110
Check them!

1706
01:13:33,166 --> 01:13:34,236
Check them!

1707
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,779
Check them!

1708
01:13:39,673 --> 01:13:40,913
Alvin and the
fucking Chipmunks!

1709
01:13:40,974 --> 01:13:44,478
Can't catch a break!

1710
01:13:44,544 --> 01:13:45,545
No, I tested them all.

1711
01:13:45,612 --> 01:13:46,852
They're all bad!

1712
01:13:46,913 --> 01:13:47,983
Listen 120 it!

1713
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:48,958
Oh, yeah!

1714
01:13:49,015 --> 01:13:49,652
Time for a beer!

1715
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:50,854
Okay?

1716
01:13:50,917 --> 01:13:52,897
So I mean, what are we gonna'
do about this, Mr. Chow?

1717
01:13:52,952 --> 01:13:54,761
Well, you send the
defective ones back,

1718
01:13:54,821 --> 01:13:56,266
we'll check them out,
see what the problem is.

1719
01:13:56,322 --> 01:13:57,460
No, no, absolutely not.

1720
01:13:57,524 --> 01:13:59,197
You fix the problem right now!

1721
01:13:59,259 --> 01:14:01,432
I need samples and stock
available right away for the

1722
01:14:01,494 --> 01:14:02,871
L.A. Gift Fair Show!

1723
01:14:02,929 --> 01:14:03,498
Let me talk to him.

1724
01:14:03,563 --> 01:14:04,166
Shut up!

1725
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:04,935
Absolutely not!

1726
01:14:04,998 --> 01:14:07,672
You got to
get over there.

1727
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:10,146
I can get you a pass.

1728
01:14:10,203 --> 01:14:15,203
<i>J")</i>

1729
01:14:36,825 --> 01:14:39,465
Well, let's see what
the problem is.

1730
01:14:39,528 --> 01:14:41,405
Oh yeah!
Time for a beer!

1731
01:14:41,463 --> 01:14:43,101
We can put a
gold resistor here,

1732
01:14:43,164 --> 01:14:45,041
stabilize the recording rate.

1733
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,774
Yes.

1734
01:14:47,836 --> 01:14:49,611
Put in <i>3</i>
bigger speaker, right?

1735
01:14:49,671 --> 01:14:50,877
Make it louder.

1736
01:14:50,939 --> 01:14:52,077
Great, great.

1737
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:56,748
How quickly can we
get, say, ten dozen?

1738
01:14:56,811 --> 01:14:58,791
Well, we can work hard.

1739
01:14:58,847 --> 01:15:00,053
Have it by tomorrow morning.

1740
01:15:00,115 --> 01:15:01,492
Great!

1741
01:15:06,221 --> 01:15:08,497
Quality control,
sound testing,

1742
01:15:08,557 --> 01:15:11,800
one hundred percent.
No more problems.

1743
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:12,565
Fabulous.

1744
01:15:12,627 --> 01:15:13,935
Excellent, Mr. Chow.

1745
01:15:13,995 --> 01:15:15,975
We're going to need the rest
of the order shipped air

1746
01:15:16,031 --> 01:15:19,171
freight at your expense, so we
can have openers in the store

1747
01:15:19,234 --> 01:15:20,838
right after the Expo.

1748
01:15:20,902 --> 01:15:23,075
The customer always
pays for the shipping.

1749
01:15:23,138 --> 01:15:28,486
Yes, but this was
your fault, Mr. Chow.

1750
01:15:28,543 --> 01:15:30,887
Well, maybe
some air freight.

1751
01:15:30,946 --> 01:15:32,823
We share the cost, yes?

1752
01:15:32,881 --> 01:15:34,792
I'll tell you, the
sooner my customers get these,

1753
01:15:34,849 --> 01:15:36,795
the sooner you get a reorder.

1754
01:15:36,851 --> 01:15:40,856
...Tsingtao!

1755
01:15:40,922 --> 01:15:42,265
What are they saying?

1756
01:15:42,324 --> 01:15:44,361
'Yes! Time
for Tsingtao!'

1757
01:15:44,426 --> 01:15:45,837
China's most popular beer.

1758
01:15:45,894 --> 01:15:48,397
I see.

1759
01:15:48,463 --> 01:15:53,463
<i>J")</i>

1760
01:16:43,518 --> 01:16:45,054
What time is it?

1761
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,899
Ten minutes to noon.

1762
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:52,837
You ready?

1763
01:16:52,894 --> 01:16:57,400
This is it, here we go.

1764
01:16:58,533 --> 01:17:00,012
It's like
the guy said once,

1765
01:17:00,068 --> 01:17:01,741
'Everything that's loose in
this country

1766
01:17:01,803 --> 01:17:04,283
eventually rolls to L.A.'

1767
01:17:04,339 --> 01:17:06,080
And they were all there.

1768
01:17:06,141 --> 01:17:09,554
From the Mom and Pop
stores to the big chains.

1769
01:17:09,611 --> 01:17:11,955
This is the biggest
trade show of the year.

1770
01:17:12,013 --> 01:17:14,391
Would you like to
see a talking beer opener?

1771
01:17:14,449 --> 01:17:17,453
That's right,
check it out right here.

1772
01:17:17,519 --> 01:17:19,499
Talk to her, she'll
make it happen, right here.

1773
01:17:19,554 --> 01:17:20,123
That's right.

1774
01:17:20,188 --> 01:17:20,928
Come on over.

1775
01:17:20,989 --> 01:17:21,433
Hey, guys.

1776
01:17:21,489 --> 01:17:22,490
Check it out.

1777
01:17:30,198 --> 01:17:32,371
Happy Hour
just got happier!

1778
01:17:32,434 --> 01:17:34,710
Let me talk to you about the
sexiest openers...

1779
01:17:34,769 --> 01:17:36,248
Excuse
me, can I buy a sample?

1780
01:17:36,304 --> 01:17:38,648
My husband is a
talking beer opener.

1781
01:17:38,707 --> 01:17:39,811
Hi.

1782
01:17:39,874 --> 01:17:40,352
Toys For Men.

1783
01:17:40,408 --> 01:17:41,546
Escondido.

1784
01:17:41,609 --> 01:17:42,986
Oh, yeah, that's
near San Diego, yeah?

1785
01:17:43,044 --> 01:17:43,647
Yeah, right.

1786
01:17:43,712 --> 01:17:45,385
Three stores, actually.

1787
01:17:45,447 --> 01:17:47,427
And let me tell you, it's so
hard to find gifts for men.

1788
01:17:47,482 --> 01:17:50,554
You walk this show, any
show, it's women's gifts,

1789
01:17:50,618 --> 01:17:51,528
women's gifts.

1790
01:17:51,586 --> 01:17:52,826
And then finally I
stumble on you guys.

1791
01:17:52,887 --> 01:17:57,302
You know, I'll take...what's
three times seventy-two?

1792
01:17:57,358 --> 01:17:58,462
Two-sixteen.

1793
01:17:58,526 --> 01:18:01,097
Yeah, two-sixteen.

1794
01:18:01,162 --> 01:18:03,233
You can write it up.

1795
01:18:03,298 --> 01:18:05,642
These are great.

1796
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:06,405
Love it.

1797
01:18:06,468 --> 01:18:07,776
All right, thank you.

1798
01:18:29,491 --> 01:18:32,438
Jesus, Larry,
look what's going on!

1799
01:18:32,494 --> 01:18:34,030
Are those
the two schmucks

1800
01:18:34,095 --> 01:18:35,130
that came to our office?

1801
01:18:35,196 --> 01:18:35,901
Yeah.

1802
01:18:35,964 --> 01:18:38,001
Guaranteed one show wonders.

1803
01:18:38,066 --> 01:18:39,238
My, my, "IV-

1804
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,973
They're getting quite a crowd.

1805
01:18:41,035 --> 01:18:43,982
Yeah, but it's
not a product for TV.

1806
01:18:44,038 --> 01:18:46,746
Too cheap, seven
dollars retail?

1807
01:18:46,808 --> 01:18:48,446
It's got to be nineteen
ninety-five for TV .

1808
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:50,786
That's the magic price.

1809
01:18:50,845 --> 01:18:53,826
If it's not on TV <i>,</i>
who gives a shit, right?

1810
01:18:53,882 --> 01:18:55,418
Hey, Newkin!

1811
01:18:55,483 --> 01:18:56,860
How 'bout you, man?

1812
01:18:56,918 --> 01:18:59,023
How 'bout you?

1813
01:18:59,087 --> 01:19:02,591
what an asshole.

1814
01:19:13,668 --> 01:19:16,581
Bye now.

1815
01:19:16,638 --> 01:19:17,616
What was that?

1816
01:19:17,672 --> 01:19:19,276
Repartee, a
gift store in Portland.

1817
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:21,581
They ordered at the show,
showed the flyer to a customer

1818
01:19:21,643 --> 01:19:23,350
who just ordered two hundred
and fifty

1819
01:19:23,411 --> 01:19:25,687
for a wedding reception.

1820
01:19:26,981 --> 01:19:31,054
Two-fifty!

1821
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:31,893
I know!

1822
01:19:31,953 --> 01:19:32,863
That's exciting, isn't it?

1823
01:19:32,921 --> 01:19:33,899
You know,
we've got this going,

1824
01:19:33,955 --> 01:19:34,990
but now we got
to keep it going.

1825
01:19:35,056 --> 01:19:36,899
I was thinking we got to
diversify the brands,

1826
01:19:36,958 --> 01:19:38,096
come up with new ideas.

1827
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,002
I was thinking, I don't know,
maybe The Three Stooges?

1828
01:19:40,061 --> 01:19:40,869
I love Curly.

1829
01:19:40,929 --> 01:19:42,340
WOO-WOO-WOO-woo!

1830
01:19:42,397 --> 01:19:46,174
What about,
'Mmmm, beer.'

1831
01:19:46,234 --> 01:19:47,975
Homer.

1832
01:19:48,036 --> 01:19:50,107
<i>Mmmm,</i> beer!

1833
01:19:50,171 --> 01:19:50,911
Beer!

1834
01:19:50,972 --> 01:19:51,507
Oh, yes!

1835
01:19:51,573 --> 01:19:58,491
WOO-hoo!

1836
01:19:59,981 --> 01:20:00,982
Matt, Craig's on two!

1837
01:20:01,049 --> 01:20:04,656
Tell him we need 3 more
phone lines

1838
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,460
What about that stuff
going to Australia?

1839
01:20:06,521 --> 01:20:08,194
How about that
order going to Australia?

1840
01:20:08,256 --> 01:20:10,827
Brenda, hold my calls!

1841
01:20:11,559 --> 01:20:12,833
Yes!

1842
01:20:12,894 --> 01:20:13,838
Oh, yes!

1843
01:20:13,895 --> 01:20:15,203
WOO-hoo!

1844
01:20:15,263 --> 01:20:18,301
...Homer Simpson!

1845
01:20:18,366 --> 01:20:23,406
...Homer Simpson!

1846
01:20:23,471 --> 01:20:27,510
(Scandinavian Man On
TV ...Homer Simpson!

1847
01:20:27,575 --> 01:20:29,851
Take
two, Talking Beer Opener.

1848
01:20:29,911 --> 01:20:31,015
Cerveza, senor?

1849
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:33,059
Si, Coronal

1850
01:20:33,114 --> 01:20:35,720
Oh, habla Espanol.

1851
01:20:35,783 --> 01:20:38,229
Si, Corona.

1852
01:20:38,286 --> 01:20:39,856
Bueno!

1853
01:20:45,193 --> 01:20:46,729
Yeah!

1854
01:20:50,999 --> 01:20:53,036
I'm really
happy for Gina.

1855
01:20:53,101 --> 01:20:55,707
She finally got that
casita she always wanted,

1856
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:59,274
bought it all by herself.

1857
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:00,944
Sam gave her a plaque to put
over the door

1858
01:21:01,009 --> 01:21:03,649
that said Casa de Homer.

1859
01:21:03,711 --> 01:21:05,850
Her sister Louisa
was horrified.

1860
01:21:05,914 --> 01:21:06,892
Hi, Sam.

1861
01:21:06,948 --> 01:21:07,722
Hey, Sam.

1862
01:21:07,782 --> 01:21:09,056
How are you doing?

1863
01:21:39,681 --> 01:21:40,318
Hey-

1864
01:21:40,381 --> 01:21:41,485
All right, guys.

1865
01:21:41,549 --> 01:21:45,292
Gina, to making your new
house a home, sister!

1866
01:21:45,353 --> 01:21:46,832
Here here!

1867
01:22:16,117 --> 01:22:18,529
Hi.

1868
01:22:18,586 --> 01:22:20,065
The place looks great.

1869
01:22:20,121 --> 01:22:22,260
Thanks.

1870
01:22:22,323 --> 01:22:26,703
Yeah, a guy could
get used to living here.

1871
01:22:26,761 --> 01:22:28,798
I don't know, Matt.

1872
01:22:28,863 --> 01:22:30,240
I don't

1873
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:45,855
Gina, seriously.

1874
01:22:48,916 --> 01:22:53,262
Okay, I got an idea.

1875
01:22:53,321 --> 01:22:55,858
You got a flashlight?

1876
01:22:55,923 --> 01:23:00,923
<i>J")</i>

1877
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,739
I'm not crazy, am I?

1878
01:23:41,803 --> 01:23:43,612
I know he's a little off.

1879
01:23:43,671 --> 01:23:45,742
Yes, but that's
why you liked him.

1880
01:23:45,807 --> 01:23:49,550
That's what I've
always loved about him.

1881
01:23:58,152 --> 01:24:02,191
Yes.
