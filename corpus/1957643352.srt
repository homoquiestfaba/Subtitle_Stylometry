1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:04,167
(lively Scottish music)

2
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:42,967
(man gasps)

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,633
- Don't you move.

4
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:50,267
Now, I'm looking for a man, a traitor, a deserter,

5
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,400
and a wanted criminal, goes by the name

6
00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:55,766
of Alan Breck Stewart.

7
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,900
- I have never heard of any such a man.

8
00:01:57,933 --> 00:02:01,334
- Oh, he's what they call a Jacobite,

9
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:04,033
a rebel against our true King George, God bless His Majesty.

10
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:05,766
And, you say to me you never heard of such a man?

11
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,766
- I never did.

12
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,000
- There's a fine reward, dear lad, 100 guineas.

13
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,033
But, since your head seems to be so empty,

14
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:18,400
perhaps I'll fill it with some shot.

15
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:22,000
- I swear to God, I never heard of any such a man.

16
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,233
- Well said, Rory lad.

17
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:26,100
- Huh?

18
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:27,167
Alan! (Alan laughing)

19
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,866
Alan, you, you misbegotten dog!

20
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,100
(lively Scottish music) (children chattering)

21
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:02,666
- Well, James.

22
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,334
- You're back.

23
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,033
- I am.

24
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:13,000
(both laugh) (crowd cheers)

25
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,000
- You rascal.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,434
I know it's not much, but it's all we could gather

27
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:20,033
for the king in France.

28
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,800
(coins clattering)

29
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:22,933
- So, when I come through Appin there was talk

30
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:23,900
of fresh evictions.

31
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:25,766
Is that true?

32
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,766
- Yes, it's true.

33
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,434
But, I've consulted with the lawyers.

34
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,167
- Oh, it's the lawyers again, now is it?

35
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,400
- We can't fight them with sword and pistol.

36
00:03:35,434 --> 00:03:38,200
- Well, you cannot fight 'em with parchment and pen, huh?

37
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:38,933
- [James] Will you listen to me?

38
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:40,700
- I will not. (dog barking)

39
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,300
Colin Campbell is not gonna rest till he's thrown

40
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:44,800
every last loyal Highlander off this land.

41
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,666
You think a wee, dusty, penny-pinching lawyer

42
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,367
is gonna stop him?

43
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,500
- You don't understand the man.

44
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:52,067
- Well, he sold himself to the Redcoats 30 years ago.

45
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,067
What's more to understand?

46
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,700
- (laughs) You would never listen to another opinion

47
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,067
not even when you were five years old

48
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,300
when I first took you in.

49
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:00,167
- Please.

50
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,167
- Colin Campbell's a reasonable man.

51
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,766
- Did you hear that, Maggie?

52
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,033
The Red Fox.

53
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,000
He's called him reasonable.

54
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:09,666
Just lies, deceit, and treachery.

55
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,666
And, you wanna legalize that?

56
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,233
- I believe you two will be still quarreling

57
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:14,233
beyond the grave.

58
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:15,233
- Then you tell him.

59
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:18,133
- There is no telling him anything nor you.

60
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:20,000
- Yeah, you stand in Colin Campbell's way, man,

61
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,800
he'll find means to remove you.

62
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,766
- No, it's the new man we're afraid of, Alan,

63
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,000
the London man.

64
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,367
- Alan wouldn't know of him.

65
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,334
- I know something of Mr. William Reid.

66
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,866
- Are you straightaway for France?

67
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,700
- Aye.

68
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:34,800
- Good.

69
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,400
I've arranged a meeting between you and the Red Fox

70
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:38,800
at the Bear Inn.

71
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:41,200
- Twos are four-- (somber flute music)

72
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:42,200
- Three.

73
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:43,800
- [Children] Three twos are six.

74
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:44,599
- [Man] Four.

75
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:45,833
- [Children] Four twos are eight.

76
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:46,766
- [Man] Five.

77
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,666
- Five twos are 10. - Good luck, David.

78
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,300
- [Man] Six.

79
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:50,700
- [Children] Six.

80
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:52,766
- Good morning, sir.

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,400
- What?

82
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:55,133
Ah, good morning.

83
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,766
- I've come to say farewell.

84
00:04:57,766 --> 00:05:00,033
- Are you sorry to leave Essendean?

85
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,167
- Oh, it's a good place, indeed, sir.

86
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,766
But, then I've never been anywhere else.

87
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,267
- (laughs) True enough.

88
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,833
Well then, to come straight to it,

89
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:13,700
when your mother was gone and your poor father

90
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:16,100
began to sicken for his end,

91
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:19,300
he gave me in charge, a certain letter.

92
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:23,700
He said it was your inheritance.

93
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:24,766
- Inheritance?

94
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:27,866
- "So, soon as I'm gone," he said,

95
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,666
"give my boy this letter and start him off

96
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,733
"to the house of Shaws by Cramond."

97
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:36,400
- May I see it, Mr. Campbell?

98
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:37,400
- Eh what?

99
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:38,633
Oh, of course.

100
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:45,233
Your father was a gentleman, of course, no doubt of that

101
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:49,400
and a learned man, too good for a country schoolmaster.

102
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:55,267
He never talked about his past, Davie,

103
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,833
but your mother did once.

104
00:05:57,866 --> 00:06:01,833
She hinted at some great quarrel in the family.

105
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:06,100
"At least my boy is safe," she said.

106
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:10,866
"God forbid he should ever see the House of Shaws."

107
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,233
I'm afraid for you, Davie.

108
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,800
Stay here and keep the school as your father did.

109
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,733
- I'll be all right, sir, I swear.

110
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:26,700
- Well, I didn't think I'd persuade you.

111
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:30,067
You'll be wanting to pay your respects.

112
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:34,833
(gentle violin music)

113
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,866
(church bells ringing)

114
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:56,200
(somber music)

115
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,033
(birds chirping)

116
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,900
(men chattering)

117
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,067
- [Marie] Oh, haven't seen you in a long time.

118
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,733
- Marie.

119
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:19,700
- There's your ale.

120
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:25,133
- Steady, Alan.

121
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:27,000
- [Alan] I thought this meeting would be friendly.

122
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,067
Guns are so unnecessary.

123
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:34,700
(door slams)

124
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:38,100
- Ah, you're no ordinary bone-headed

125
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:41,033
- You're no ordinary traitor, Colin.

126
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:44,766
Judas himself could've taken a lesson from you.

127
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,900
- You always did have wit.

128
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:49,733
- Aye.

129
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:50,800
- Take a drink.

130
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,400
You know, I never could understand it.

131
00:07:57,766 --> 00:08:00,800
How a clever man like you could throw his life away

132
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:03,000
on such a cause.

133
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:04,967
- I would never expect a Campbell to understand

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,766
the notion of loyalty.

135
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,633
- Think yourself.

136
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,067
What's your life now?

137
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,866
You're in exile, a fugitive, a fallen man

138
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,633
drowning in his own poverty.

139
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:19,334
- Have I had a choice?

140
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,367
- [Colin] Join us.

141
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,167
Come over to King George and the English cause.

142
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:29,400
- You know, somehow poverty

143
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:31,633
seems to strengthen my resolve, Colin.

144
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:35,900
(laughs)

145
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,967
- It hardly improves the condition of your people, Alan.

146
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,233
- Aye. - You know our policy

147
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:41,700
is to drive them off the land.

148
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:43,434
- Oh, is the policy to burn them off the land?

149
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:45,100
Is the policy to pluck the toys

150
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,700
from the hands of our children?

151
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:50,167
- Say yes to me and I'll protect them, all of them.

152
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:53,833
- Oh, you have that power?

153
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,666
- I am the King's Factor.

154
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,833
Of course I have the power.

155
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:02,766
(fire crackling)

156
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,633
- You'll swear to it?

157
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:10,900
All right, I have the dram.

158
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:13,400
Slunger.

159
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:15,434
- Slunger, Alan.

160
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:17,666
(dramatic music)

161
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,766
(furniture clattering)

162
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,800
(window shattering) (dog barking)

163
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:43,833
- He's escaped.

164
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,633
- This may go hard for you.

165
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:53,900
- The devil if I'll be questioned

166
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:55,733
by any jumped up Englishman.

167
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:59,800
I answer to no one but the King himself.

168
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,434
One word from me and you'll be packing your wee bag,

169
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:05,700
skulking back to where you came from.

170
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,334
Wherever that may be.

171
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,367
- An idle threat?

172
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,167
- No, I take it very seriously.

173
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,833
Very seriously, indeed.

174
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:25,967
(somber flute music)

175
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:31,933
(birds cawing)

176
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,700
(loud knocking)

177
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,267
(window clacking)

178
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,133
- It's loaded.

179
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:03,766
- I have a letter for Mr. Ebenezer Balfour of Shaws.

180
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,700
- Who's it from?

181
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,400
- That's no concern of yours.

182
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,500
Is he here?

183
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:12,666
- Put it down on the doorstep and be off with you.

184
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,100
- It's a letter of introduction.

185
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,300
- A what?

186
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:16,666
- A letter of introduction.

187
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,000
- Who are you?

188
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:20,666
- My name is David Balfour.

189
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:26,800
- Is your father dead?

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,367
Oh, aye, he'll be dead no doubt.

191
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:37,400
Well, man, I'll let you in.

192
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:43,700
You hungry?

193
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:45,666
(chuckles)

194
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,133
You can eat that bit of porridge.

195
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,900
- [David] Is that not your own meal?

196
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:50,833
- You can have it.

197
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,367
Now, let's see the letter.

198
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,200
- I told you before, the letter's for Mr. Balfour.

199
00:11:58,233 --> 00:11:59,633
- Who do you think I am?

200
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,800
Take me for a servant?

201
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:03,866
I keep none.

202
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,067
Give me Alexander's letter.

203
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,300
- You know my father's name?

204
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:10,633
- It would be strange if I did not since he was my brother.

205
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,167
Boy, I'm your born uncle, Davie, my man.

206
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,967
So, just give us the letter and sit there

207
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,100
and eat your porridge.

208
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:32,599
Do you know what's in it?

209
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:34,367
- Uh, you can see for yourself, sir,

210
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,033
the seal's not been broken.

211
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:37,700
- But, what brought you here?

212
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,000
- To deliver the letter.

213
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:44,300
- Aye, but you'd have had some hopes no doubt.

214
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,900
- I confess, sir, that when I was told I had kin folk,

215
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,300
well-to-do, I did indulge the hope,

216
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:53,434
that they would help me in my life.

217
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:56,000
- No doubt, no doubt.

218
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:57,633
- But, I look for no favors.

219
00:12:58,367 --> 00:12:59,766
I'm no beggar.

220
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,933
- You have the air of one.

221
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:06,200
- Uh, well, poor as I appear, sir,

222
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,700
I have friends who would gladly help me.

223
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:11,666
- Don't fly up in the air at me.

224
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,633
We'll agree fine yet.

225
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:19,133
Well, if you're done with that porridge,

226
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,866
I'll just take a bit of it myself.

227
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:32,766
Your father long dead?

228
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,733
- Three weeks.

229
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,833
- He was a secret man, Alexander,

230
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:43,933
a secret, silent man.

231
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:47,367
Did he ever say anything about me?

232
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,700
- I never even knew he had a brother.

233
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:53,033
- Oh, dear me, dear me.

234
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,300
We'll agree fine yet.

235
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,733
I'm glad I let you in.

236
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:09,000
(mysterious music)

237
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,766
You stay here awhile.

238
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,700
I've some business to attend to.

239
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:27,267
(moving to ominous music)

240
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,666
(book thudding)

241
00:14:58,434 --> 00:15:01,666
(hammer thudding)

242
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,866
(beam clattering)

243
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,100
You a reader, Davie? (thunder rumbling)

244
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:24,233
- A great reader, sir.

245
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:29,334
- I meant to ask you before.

246
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:32,800
Your mother?

247
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,800
- She died two years ago.

248
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:45,866
Was my father very quick at his learning, Uncle?

249
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,566
- Alexander?

250
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,167
No, no, I was the clever one.

251
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:50,800
Why do you ask?

252
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:54,100
- Well, this book's inscribed to you.

253
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:58,367
To my brother Ebenezer on his fifth birthday.

254
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,833
- What's to that?

255
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:01,200
- Oh, you were the elder were you not?

256
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,067
- Of course.

257
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,100
- Well, that's no child's writing.

258
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:09,033
(mysterious music)

259
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:13,400
- It's our father's hand.

260
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:16,766
I remember now how Alexander asked our father

261
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,233
to inscribe the book.

262
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,400
Ah.

263
00:16:21,434 --> 00:16:23,800
One excellent work of religion.

264
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:28,334
You could do worse than study it, Davie.

265
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:36,133
(tense lively music) (sword clattering)

266
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,933
- Alan Breck has walked into our trap, sir.

267
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:03,233
(ominous music)

268
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:10,000
(Alan sniffs)

269
00:17:10,033 --> 00:17:12,866
(horses snorting)

270
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:27,334
(birds chirping)

271
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:30,033
(twig snapping)

272
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,367
(gun firing) - Ah, getting away!

273
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,766
(man shouting)

274
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,300
- [Man] Fire at will!

275
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:39,400
(dramatic music)

276
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,766
(horse hooves clomping)

277
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:46,766
(man laughs)

278
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:54,700
- Aye.

279
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,167
He left this for you, sir.

280
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
(laughs)

281
00:17:58,233 --> 00:17:59,700
- Will you stop laughing?

282
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:03,400
Mr. Reid, John MacKenzie's my man.

283
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:07,700
If there's a reprimand to be given, I'll give it.

284
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:11,133
(birds chirping)

285
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:15,133
To Colin Campbell, the Red Fox and Mr. William Reid

286
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,267
of no man knows where.

287
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,900
King James the Sixth of Scotland and First of England

288
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,666
whose name of Stewart I have the honor to bear

289
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,400
said this of smoking tobacco.

290
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:31,300
A custom loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose,

291
00:18:31,334 --> 00:18:33,033
and harmful to the brain.

292
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:35,267
(both laughing)

293
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,733
He always had a pretty wit did Alan Breck.

294
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:44,000
Ah, you foolish wee man.

295
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:46,633
It was that stinking pipe of yours lost us the game.

296
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:52,733
(horse snorting)

297
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,766
(thunder cracking)

298
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:07,733
- Do you never take anything other than porridge, Uncle?

299
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,200
- No, no, never.

300
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:16,267
Davie, I've been thinking, and...

301
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,866
(thunder cracking)

302
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,833
There's some amount of money that I promised,

303
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:24,933
or half promised to you before you were born,

304
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:26,400
promised your father that is all,

305
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:28,700
nothing legal, you understand.

306
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:31,400
(thunder cracking)

307
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:33,733
I kept that bit of money separate.

308
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:41,766
It was a great expense, but a promise is a promise.

309
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:46,300
Stay back.

310
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,267
(thunder cracking)

311
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,833
Sit down, just sit you down, Davie boy.

312
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,233
(lock clattering)

313
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:08,267
(thunder cracking) (wind whistling)

314
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,067
Well, by careful husbandry

315
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,400
that bit of money has now grown

316
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:23,400
to be a matter of just exactly,

317
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:28,733
just precisely 60 guineas.

318
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:29,666
- 60 guineas?

319
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:33,766
- It's an important sum of money.

320
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,733
(coins clanking)

321
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,067
(thunder cracking)

322
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,933
Count it.

323
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:47,033
(wind whistling)

324
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:49,700
Count it.

325
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:52,666
(thunder cracking)

326
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:55,000
There's more.

327
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,300
- More, sir?

328
00:20:58,334 --> 00:20:59,167
- Much more.

329
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:04,800
We're the last of the Balfours of Shaws you and I, Davie.

330
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,700
There's the matter of the estate.

331
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:11,300
It's the question of how affairs will be settled

332
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:14,400
after I am gone and what provision must be made

333
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:15,833
for you now.

334
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:18,666
It's a complicated business, Davie.

335
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,067
We're talking about considerable, not to say,

336
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,666
extensive land and property.

337
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,766
And, the relevant papers

338
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,833
I keep in a chest at the top of the tower.

339
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:37,400
Will you fetch it for me?

340
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:39,633
- Of course, Uncle.

341
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,633
(ominous music)

342
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:57,766
(thunder cracking)

343
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,233
(stairs creaking)

344
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,200
(thunder cracking)

345
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:18,666
(stairs cracking)

346
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,866
(Davie shouts)

347
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,633
(Davie grunting)

348
00:22:27,434 --> 00:22:28,666
Uncle!

349
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:30,700
Help!

350
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,900
Oh my God.

351
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:36,766
Uncle!

352
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,633
Help!

353
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,733
Uncle!

354
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,800
(grunts)

355
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:54,666
(thunder cracking)

356
00:22:59,133 --> 00:22:59,967
Uncle!

357
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:01,866
(screams)

358
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,400
(Davie thuds)

359
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:13,133
(ominous music)

360
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,766
(wind whistles)

361
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:20,167
(door clattering)

362
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,300
(footsteps clomping)

363
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,067
- Oh my God!

364
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,334
Davie!

365
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:38,400
You're back.

366
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:42,233
Why man, you're hurt.

367
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:45,800
Sit down, sit down.

368
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,666
I'll get you a cordial.

369
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,700
Whatever happened?

370
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,700
- Uh, the stairs.

371
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:57,766
- You had a fall?

372
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,334
- Yeah, uh, no, uh,

373
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:04,334
they gave way under me.

374
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,800
- The whole stairs?

375
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:11,300
Dear me, dear me. - Yeah.

376
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,933
- Let's see.

377
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:17,267
(Davie sighs)

378
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:25,033
No harm done.

379
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,300
- I was lucky to save my life.

380
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,100
(panting)

381
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:33,800
(ominous music)

382
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:38,334
- Tomorrow morning we'll walk over to Queensferry.

383
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,233
My lawyer, Rankeillor, he keeps a copy of every document.

384
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:46,700
And, then we'll maybe stop at the inn on the way

385
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:51,200
to see Captain Hoseason of the Breck covenant.

386
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:55,334
(lively flute music)

387
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,967
Captain Hoseason?

388
00:25:07,267 --> 00:25:08,100
- Mr. Balfour.

389
00:25:09,766 --> 00:25:11,033
- This is an unexpected pleasure, sir.

390
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:14,367
- Ah, well, I was passing and I remembered

391
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,167
that there are papers to be signed.

392
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,067
- May I present my second officer, Mr. Riach?

393
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,300
- Proud to know you, Mr. Balfour.

394
00:25:23,334 --> 00:25:25,700
(birds chirping)

395
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,033
- This is my brother's son, David Balfour,

396
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,933
the heir to Shaws.

397
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:32,133
- Captain.

398
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:35,033
- [Captain] It's an honor indeed, Mr. Balfour.

399
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:39,400
- David will order meat and drink for us,

400
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:41,000
porridge and a mug of ale for me,

401
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:43,334
but whatever you fancy for yourself,

402
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:45,700
don't mind the expense.

403
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:46,700
- Thank you, Uncle.

404
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:49,367
Gentlemen.

405
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:01,367
- He's a pleasant young man, your nephew.

406
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:07,733
- He's a troublesome lad.

407
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:14,367
I'd like to be rid of him.

408
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,933
(patrons chattering)

409
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:20,100
- Are you kin to Ebenezer?

410
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:23,434
- Uh, yes, yes, I'm his brother's son.

411
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:24,900
- Mr. Alexander's son?

412
00:26:26,267 --> 00:26:28,000
- Yes, yes, that's right.

413
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:30,267
- You must've been no more than a small baby

414
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,666
when he died.

415
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:35,633
- Uh, my father died three weeks ago, sir.

416
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:40,233
- (laughs) There's a grand story

417
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:43,633
against Ebenezer proved false, more's the pity.

418
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,367
- I don't understand you.

419
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,933
What story?

420
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:50,666
- That Ebenezer killed his brother.

421
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,666
- (laughs) No, no he did not, no.

422
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,766
Why would Ebenezer kill his own brother?

423
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,666
- For the estate, of course.

424
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:05,167
(ominous music) Here is a mystery.

425
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,033
If Ebenezer didn't kill his brother,

426
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,666
how come he's Laird of Shaws?

427
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,400
- Was Alexander the first-born son?

428
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,200
Was he?

429
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:18,067
- [Landlord] Of course.

430
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,666
- Do you know a lawyer by the name of Rankeillor, sir?

431
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,666
- I know him well.

432
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:28,700
- Could you direct me to his house, please?

433
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:37,766
(Davie grunts) (Riach grunts)

434
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,633
- Right.

435
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:42,133
Right, heave, push.

436
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,067
- [Driver] Yeah, here.

437
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,033
(wagon clattering)

438
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:53,100
(dark music)

439
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,033
(lamp squeaking)

440
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:03,400
(rat squeaking)

441
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:06,700
(footsteps clacking)

442
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,900
- Don't worry, lad.

443
00:28:16,766 --> 00:28:17,866
The world's not ended.

444
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,700
Here, have a sip of this.

445
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,200
(footsteps clacking)

446
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,067
He has a high fever.

447
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,766
I want him taken out of this hull

448
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,334
and put in the forecastle.

449
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:52,800
- Well, what you want, Mr. Riach is of concern

450
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:54,400
to nobody but yourself.

451
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,100
- Look, I'm paid, and none too much either,

452
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:02,733
to be second officer of this old tub.

453
00:29:02,766 --> 00:29:04,067
I'm paid for nothing more.

454
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,933
- Put him where you please.

455
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,700
- Right, lad.

456
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:24,167
Up you go.

457
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,400
Come on you get, lad.

458
00:29:25,434 --> 00:29:27,434
(both grunting)

459
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,367
Come on lad, you're going up top.

460
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,233
- [Ransome] No, Mr. Shuan.

461
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:33,100
- [Shuan] Come here!

462
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:37,100
- It wasn't me. - You little thief!

463
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:37,967
Man!

464
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,766
I'll take the hide off you this time!

465
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:47,100
- (grunts) No, no, no, no, no (screams).

466
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:49,766
(Shuan grunts)

467
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,167
- For God sake, man.

468
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,733
- No, please!

469
00:29:52,766 --> 00:29:54,733
Please, no!

470
00:29:54,766 --> 00:29:55,900
Please!

471
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:56,900
Please no!

472
00:29:56,933 --> 00:29:57,700
- Smartly.

473
00:29:57,733 --> 00:29:59,067
- [David] No, no, sir, I beg you!

474
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:01,334
- There we go you now.

475
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:03,500
Aye, aye.

476
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:06,700
You know, it's a curious thing.

477
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:11,733
Mr. Shuan, sober, is a quiet, kindly sort of a fellow

478
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:15,233
and, the only true sailor on this old cursed ship.

479
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,733
You see Mr. Shuan drunk, he's a raging devil.

480
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,400
- You know I don't belong here.

481
00:30:22,434 --> 00:30:25,133
- (chuckles) Now, me, I'm the exact opposite.

482
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:29,733
When I'm sober, I'm a sullen kind of man.

483
00:30:29,766 --> 00:30:32,900
- I have friends who would pay you handsomely

484
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:34,067
if you helped me.

485
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,933
- You see, when I'm drunk, which most of the time I am,

486
00:30:38,267 --> 00:30:39,233
I'm an angel.

487
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:41,033
- You let me write one line

488
00:30:41,067 --> 00:30:42,933
to the Minister Campbell of Essean...

489
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:48,267
- If you please, Mr, Riach.

490
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:50,933
- Aye, Captain.

491
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:53,633
(ship creaking)

492
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,733
- No.

493
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:04,400
No.

494
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,833
I beg you.

495
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:09,766
No (cries).

496
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:16,133
(dramatic music) (horse hooves clomping)

497
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,200
- He was spotted two hours ago.

498
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:30,900
I think he must head either through Craighsheil or Draemore.

499
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:32,733
- Then split up.

500
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,300
You go to Craighsheil, send your ensign to Draemore.

501
00:31:35,334 --> 00:31:37,933
I assume you have informants in both places.

502
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:39,666
- Uh, not that I know of.

503
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,766
- I suppose we'll have to rely on mine.

504
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:54,700
- Ewan of Appin.

505
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:58,300
- No, Thomas Clousten's my name.

506
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,100
- Aye, what was it last time?

507
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:03,367
Robert, gimme those guineas, lad, gimme the guineas.

508
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
- Your passage is arranged and paid for.

509
00:32:06,434 --> 00:32:08,766
A French ship, the Bonaventure.

510
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,500
- Aye, I know her.

511
00:32:09,534 --> 00:32:11,300
Captain Perrault is still aboard?

512
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:13,133
- On the night of the 4th she'll lie to,

513
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:14,833
just off the coast.

514
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,866
There's a bed for you at the inn at Craighsheil.

515
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,733
Wait there, friends will come for you.

516
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,300
And, be careful.

517
00:32:21,334 --> 00:32:22,000
- Ah, lad.

518
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:23,700
- Ah, things have changed, Alan.

519
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,933
You don't find the same loyalty in the people

520
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:27,400
and there's a new man sent from London.

521
00:32:27,434 --> 00:32:30,733
- Aye, that pipe-smoking lackey, Mr. William Reid.

522
00:32:30,766 --> 00:32:31,733
- [Ewan] I've yet to encounter the man.

523
00:32:31,766 --> 00:32:33,434
- [Alan] Well, you'll catch more than a whiff.

524
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:35,100
- [Ewan] I hope to soon.

525
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,434
I've taken a job as a servant in his own kitchens.

526
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:39,666
- [Alan] That's a dangerous game, Ewan.

527
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,733
- [Ewan] By all accounts, he's a man to be reckoned with.

528
00:32:42,766 --> 00:32:45,334
(dramatic music)

529
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
- Food for the prisoner?

530
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,300
Good lad.

531
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:56,866
Keep him fit and strong now so he'll fetch a good price

532
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,300
and I'll see to it that you get your fair share.

533
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,067
- [David] You know where we're bound?

534
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,933
- Of course I do.

535
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:09,033
- [David] Well?

536
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:09,900
- South Carolina.

537
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:13,233
Old Heasy-Oasey says he'll get 60 guineas for you.

538
00:33:14,766 --> 00:33:15,434
- What do you mean?

539
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:16,967
- I seen him do it too.

540
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,200
At the slave auctions, bidding up the price.

541
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,666
- They're gonna sell me into slavery?

542
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,434
- Well, Old Heasy-Oasey don't take no passengers

543
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:26,233
aboard his brig.

544
00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:27,900
- Listen, listen, listen, listen.

545
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,700
You help me get away and I will set you up for life.

546
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:34,733
- Put me to a trade more like.

547
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:36,300
I know a trick or two worth more than any trade.

548
00:33:36,334 --> 00:33:38,700
- For the love of God, man, do you not want to escape

549
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:40,167
Mr. Shuan's beatings.

550
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,367
- Lemme see him try it.

551
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,267
I stole that, I did.

552
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,766
I'll dare him to touch me.

553
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,633
I'll kill him.

554
00:33:52,434 --> 00:33:54,167
He ain't the first.

555
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,033
(ominous music)

556
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,800
No, Mr. Shaun, no, (groans)

557
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:03,733
no (screams)!

558
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:08,800
(ship creaking)

559
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,800
- David Balfour, I want you to serve on the roundhouse.

560
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:17,200
You and Ransome are to exchange places.

561
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:20,067
(chains clanking)

562
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,400
(somber music)

563
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,334
- Drunken swine!

564
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:47,200
Do you know what you've done?

565
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:48,633
You've murdered the boy.

566
00:34:51,033 --> 00:34:53,666
Mr. Riach, this must never be known.

567
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,000
The boy went overboard.

568
00:34:57,467 --> 00:34:59,866
That's what the story is.

569
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,500
- You should've interfered long ago.

570
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:06,267
Gimme that.

571
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:09,833
- I'll kill you for that!

572
00:35:09,866 --> 00:35:12,633
(men grunting)

573
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:19,334
- [Riach] Come on, man, I'll skin you alive,

574
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,800
you drunken slob!

575
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,700
- [Hoseason] Take onto himself the soul

576
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:25,700
of our dear brother here departed.

577
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,233
We, therefore, commit his body to the deep

578
00:35:29,267 --> 00:35:32,733
to be turned into corruption, looking for the resurrection

579
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:36,000
of the body when the sea shall give up her dead.

580
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:40,967
(water splashing)

581
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:44,766
(gentle music)

582
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:51,133
- [Man] Can you see the French ship?

583
00:35:58,766 --> 00:36:00,334
- There, there.

584
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,334
There she is now.

585
00:36:05,334 --> 00:36:06,133
Hey Capitaine.

586
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:09,833
Capitaine Perrault.

587
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,133
Hey Capitaine.

588
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:15,666
- That's French.

589
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,300
- Why?

590
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:18,633
- Capitaine Perrault.

591
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,233
Hey Capitaine.

592
00:36:23,434 --> 00:36:24,766
- Lower the ladder.

593
00:36:34,467 --> 00:36:35,733
- Bless you, lads.

594
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:37,666
See, you safe home now.

595
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,766
(groaning)

596
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:49,267
There's a mistake here.

597
00:36:50,434 --> 00:36:52,666
You've not the look of a Frenchman.

598
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,666
- Unlike you, sir.

599
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,434
You have a French soldier's coat upon your back

600
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:59,167
and a Scotch tongue in your head.

601
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:01,267
Step aboard, sir.

602
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,233
- Well, an invitation so prettily put

603
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:06,400
cannot be well refused.

604
00:37:08,766 --> 00:37:10,067
I take it you're no Jacobites.

605
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,300
- I take it you are.

606
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:17,334
As to my causes, let me tell you where I stand.

607
00:37:18,766 --> 00:37:22,033
I am for the prosperity of myself and my crew

608
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:23,666
and against everything else.

609
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:26,766
- You're a practical man.

610
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:28,700
- I hope so.

611
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,434
- I've an uncommon hunger and thirst.

612
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:35,633
(sword clacking)

613
00:37:36,766 --> 00:37:38,167
- There's a remedy for that sir,

614
00:37:39,434 --> 00:37:41,200
if you'll step into the roundhouse.

615
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,666
- Yes, I was bound for France.

616
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,400
There was a French ship cruising hereabouts

617
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,033
to pick me up but she must've give me the go by

618
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:53,400
in the fog.

619
00:37:53,434 --> 00:37:55,733
So, if you can set me ashore to where I was going,

620
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:58,334
I have the means to reward you highly for your trouble.

621
00:37:58,367 --> 00:37:59,500
- In France?

622
00:37:59,534 --> 00:38:04,267
Oh no, sir, that I cannot do, but where you come from,

623
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,400
we might talk of that.

624
00:38:07,434 --> 00:38:09,800
Davie, run out to the galley and fetch some meat

625
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:10,733
for the gentleman.

626
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,933
Lively now.

627
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:17,833
- Better off where he is.

628
00:38:17,866 --> 00:38:19,267
He won't be able to swing his sword.

629
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,633
- True, but he'll be hard to come at.

630
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,267
- Half of it and I'm your man.

631
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,766
- I told you, not one penny of that belongs to me.

632
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,633
Belongs to another.

633
00:38:40,033 --> 00:38:41,900
Now, I'd be a fool not to spend some of it

634
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:44,200
so that the rest might come safe.

635
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:45,967
But, sir, I'd be a dog indeed

636
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,833
to spend that much on my safety.

637
00:38:50,467 --> 00:38:52,800
- 100 guineas, that's my price.

638
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:53,666
- 50.

639
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,666
- Done.

640
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,100
And, here's my hand on it.

641
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:01,833
And, we'll alter course at once.

642
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,766
I'll see to it.

643
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,700
- Thank you, lad.

644
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,766
- So, you're a Jacobite.

645
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,633
- Aye.

646
00:39:22,434 --> 00:39:25,866
And, you by your long face should be for King George.

647
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,000
- Betwixt and between.

648
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:33,733
- Mr. Betwixt and Between, this bottle of yours is dry.

649
00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:38,167
I'm paying 50 guineas for the cruise.

650
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,100
Be a hard thing to begrudge me a dram.

651
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:43,967
- I'll go and ask the captain for the key.

652
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,067
- You have your pistol, Captain.

653
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,933
- He has two.

654
00:39:55,033 --> 00:39:57,800
The other firearms are locked up in the roundhouse.

655
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,300
- Here's our chance to get the firearms.

656
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:05,000
- Um, the gentleman's seeking a drink, Captain,

657
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:06,666
and the bottle's dry.

658
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,000
Would you give me the key?

659
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:11,133
- Davie, my man, that wild Highlander

660
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:14,167
is a danger to the ship besides being a rank enemy

661
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,367
to King George, God save him.

662
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,233
- Aye, we've swords and cutlasses enough

663
00:40:20,267 --> 00:40:23,200
but the firearms are in the roundhouse under his nose.

664
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:25,933
- If I or Mr. Riach was to go in to get them,

665
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:27,334
he might start thinking.

666
00:40:27,367 --> 00:40:28,866
- [Riach] But, a lad like you, Davie,

667
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,033
you could snap up a pistol or two without remark.

668
00:40:32,067 --> 00:40:34,733
- Do it cleverly and I'll bear it in mind

669
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,334
when we come to South Carolina.

670
00:40:45,334 --> 00:40:48,200
Here's the bit of money that you had on you.

671
00:40:48,233 --> 00:40:49,766
And, with my apologies, Davie.

672
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,766
- I had 60 guineas on me.

673
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,233
- Davie, your uncle took that.

674
00:40:57,133 --> 00:41:00,766
And, see here, that Jacobite has a belt full of gold.

675
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:06,400
And, I give you my word, you shall have your fingers in it.

676
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:09,300
(ominous music)

677
00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:13,800
(keys clanking)

678
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:23,200
- Do you want to be killed?

679
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:26,400
- Why?

680
00:41:26,434 --> 00:41:27,933
Is that how the wind sets?

681
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,434
- They're all murderers here.

682
00:41:30,467 --> 00:41:32,033
It's a ship full of them.

683
00:41:32,067 --> 00:41:33,400
Now, they've already murdered a boy,

684
00:41:33,434 --> 00:41:36,733
and you, Mr. Jacobite, are next.

685
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:38,133
- Well, they haven't got me yet.

686
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,100
Will you stand with me?

687
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,200
- I'm no murderer.

688
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,033
I'm no thief.

689
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:49,700
I will.

690
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,733
- Good.

691
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:54,033
What's your name, lad?

692
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,400
- My name is David Balfour of Shaws.

693
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:00,067
- Of Shaws, indeed.

694
00:42:00,933 --> 00:42:04,400
- My name is Stewart, Alan Breck they call me.

695
00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:07,300
(ominous music)

696
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:19,866
They've three ways to come at us here, Davie.

697
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,033
These windows, that skylight, and the door.

698
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:23,766
- I'll shut the door.

699
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,833
- Not so.

700
00:42:24,866 --> 00:42:27,033
I've but one face and so long as that door is open

701
00:42:27,067 --> 00:42:29,367
and my face is to it, I have my enemies in front of me.

702
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,200
That's where I prefer to find them.

703
00:42:31,233 --> 00:42:32,233
Can you use a sword?

704
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,900
- I never have.

705
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:34,900
- Cutlass then?

706
00:42:34,933 --> 00:42:35,733
- No.

707
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:36,766
- A dirk?

708
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,666
- No.

709
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,633
- Could you contrive to pull a trigger?

710
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:40,367
I'll prime and load these pistols for you.

711
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,800
- Of course I can.

712
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:43,267
My father used to take me hunting rabbits.

713
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,700
- [Alan] Well, thanks be to God for that.

714
00:42:45,733 --> 00:42:46,933
- But, I'm not very good shot.

715
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:48,666
- Aye, but you'll admit to it.

716
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:51,067
Bravely said.

717
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,400
Not many a soldier would not dare to say that.

718
00:43:02,434 --> 00:43:03,067
Follow me close.

719
00:43:04,233 --> 00:43:05,866
It is my part to keep this door

720
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,300
and look for the main battle.

721
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,300
Stay with the bed, you guard that window

722
00:43:09,334 --> 00:43:10,233
and that skylight.

723
00:43:13,434 --> 00:43:15,766
- I, too, have but one face, Mr. Stewart, I can't--

724
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,000
- [Alan] Ah, but you've ears on either side of it.

725
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,866
- They have to break the glass.

726
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,800
- There you go.

727
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,200
You've some rudiments of sense.

728
00:43:25,233 --> 00:43:29,033
(men shouting) (swords clattering)

729
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:30,400
- Come on, lads, come on.

730
00:43:31,267 --> 00:43:32,766
Here!

731
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,100
It's equal shares, now lads.

732
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:35,233
Come on!

733
00:43:35,267 --> 00:43:36,666
(mumbles) Come with me!

734
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,400
Who's with me?

735
00:43:37,434 --> 00:43:38,666
- Steady, Davie.

736
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,133
The crew's coming.

737
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:45,933
- [Man] (mumbles) for every man.

738
00:43:45,967 --> 00:43:49,167
(all shouting) (swords clanking)

739
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,100
(men grunting)

740
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:54,733
(men shouting)

741
00:44:02,733 --> 00:44:04,300
(gun firing)

742
00:44:04,334 --> 00:44:07,000
(man screaming)

743
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:12,833
(punches thudding) (men grunting)

744
00:44:17,766 --> 00:44:18,367
(man shouting)

745
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,000
(Alan grunting)

746
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:21,666
- [Alan] Arms, Davie.

747
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,833
(dramatic music)

748
00:44:22,866 --> 00:44:24,967
(glass shattering)

749
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,434
(man shouting)

750
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:27,267
(gun firing)

751
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,866
(men grunting)

752
00:44:34,033 --> 00:44:36,334
(gun firing)

753
00:44:36,367 --> 00:44:41,367
(swords clanking) (men grunting)

754
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:04,300
(Alan panting)

755
00:45:05,766 --> 00:45:07,100
Come to my arms, Davie.

756
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:10,267
I love you like a brother.

757
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,700
And, I'm a no bonny fighter.

758
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:16,700
(panting)

759
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:20,633
(somber music)

760
00:45:35,267 --> 00:45:38,100
(water splashing)

761
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,666
- We'll have to parlez.

762
00:45:43,766 --> 00:45:45,100
There's nothing else for it.

763
00:45:57,766 --> 00:45:58,700
- You know, I have these buttons

764
00:45:58,733 --> 00:46:00,100
from my father, Duncan Stewart.

765
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,267
He died when I was a boy.

766
00:46:04,467 --> 00:46:06,800
He was the greatest sword in the Highlands.

767
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,733
I want you to take that as a keepsake

768
00:46:11,766 --> 00:46:12,900
for what you done.

769
00:46:12,933 --> 00:46:14,733
(gentle flute music)

770
00:46:14,766 --> 00:46:16,167
And, wherever you go, you show that

771
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,833
and my friends will come round you.

772
00:46:19,866 --> 00:46:20,900
- Ahoy the roundhouse.

773
00:46:21,933 --> 00:46:23,766
Ahoy, roundhouse.

774
00:46:33,434 --> 00:46:34,267
Will you parlez?

775
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,000
- I tell you what I'll do.

776
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,334
I'll offer you an exchange.

777
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,933
That against two buckets of water.

778
00:46:50,434 --> 00:46:52,800
And, if he's alive, I'll speak to your captain.

779
00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:55,733
- Oh, he's alive all right.

780
00:46:55,766 --> 00:46:57,033
(grunts)

781
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:58,800
- That's more than he deserves.

782
00:47:10,467 --> 00:47:13,300
(water splashing)

783
00:47:26,334 --> 00:47:27,666
Would you lend a hand, David?

784
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,933
- Ahoy, the roundhouse.

785
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,033
(water splashing)

786
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:40,700
Ahoy, the roundhouse.

787
00:47:43,434 --> 00:47:46,666
You've made a sore hatch of my brig, sir.

788
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,133
- That's none of my choosing.

789
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,300
I'll give you 30 guineas

790
00:47:51,334 --> 00:47:54,434
to set me on dry shore at Ardnamurhcan.

791
00:47:54,467 --> 00:47:56,766
- I haven't men enough to work this ship.

792
00:47:57,434 --> 00:48:00,167
And, my navigator, Mr. Shuan has had your sword

793
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,233
through his vitals.

794
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,100
50!

795
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:03,967
- 30!

796
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:08,766
- If I hadn't lost so much money on this plagiary cruise,

797
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,400
I'd see you at the rope's end.

798
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,033
Batten down the hatches.

799
00:48:16,067 --> 00:48:17,300
There's a storm coming.

800
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:23,000
- You know, I trust that captain as I would a snake

801
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:23,833
in the grass.

802
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:26,666
(David laughs)

803
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,334
You see that?

804
00:48:28,967 --> 00:48:29,800
That's gold.

805
00:48:31,933 --> 00:48:36,133
Will you keep it for me, till we're safe ashore?

806
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,599
- If you want.

807
00:48:38,633 --> 00:48:41,666
- That's a trust I'm putting to you, man.

808
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:45,733
- I told you before, I'm no thief.

809
00:48:45,766 --> 00:48:47,033
- That's not what I mean.

810
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,133
You heard of tax?

811
00:48:50,233 --> 00:48:54,100
My people pay it and heavily too to your King George.

812
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:57,367
But, they're through, David.

813
00:48:59,233 --> 00:49:01,033
They've toiled and bled for many a year

814
00:49:01,067 --> 00:49:02,434
and they scrape up a second tax.

815
00:49:02,467 --> 00:49:03,700
That's it.

816
00:49:04,933 --> 00:49:06,967
That's for the true king of this country.

817
00:49:09,766 --> 00:49:12,167
He's just over the water there for awhile in France.

818
00:49:13,733 --> 00:49:15,200
- They pay tax to two kings?

819
00:49:15,233 --> 00:49:17,900
- Aye, and you're looking at the man that carries it.

820
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,900
(thunder rumbling)

821
00:49:22,933 --> 00:49:27,400
- Well, I'll be honest, I am for King George, I am.

822
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,933
But, I call that noble.

823
00:49:31,967 --> 00:49:32,599
- Noble.

824
00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:37,033
Their hearts are staunch, David.

825
00:49:38,833 --> 00:49:42,133
- I'll look after your gold as if it were my own.

826
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:43,666
- Sir, I believe you will.

827
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,434
But, let me tell you something more.

828
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:50,833
You see, when Bonny Prince Charlie was

829
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:53,666
there was a price put of 30,000 pounds for his head.

830
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,334
Not one man, woman, or child in all the Highlands

831
00:49:58,367 --> 00:49:59,267
ever betrayed him.

832
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:04,000
And, you think on that, Mr. Betwixt and Between.

833
00:50:05,733 --> 00:50:08,300
(waves crashing)

834
00:50:11,033 --> 00:50:14,267
(men shouting)

835
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,100
(water splashing)

836
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:15,967
- Alan!

837
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:23,700
(water splashing) (men shouting)

838
00:50:25,133 --> 00:50:25,967
Alan!

839
00:50:36,766 --> 00:50:39,133
- Two points to starboard!

840
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:41,067
Starboard, starboard!

841
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:41,933
- Aye.

842
00:50:48,133 --> 00:50:49,766
Captain, she can't take it. - Rock port side!

843
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:56,133
(ship rumbling) (men shouting)

844
00:51:03,067 --> 00:51:08,067
(Captain shouting) (dramatic music)

845
00:51:13,133 --> 00:51:13,967
- Alan!

846
00:51:15,233 --> 00:51:16,067
Alan!

847
00:51:19,733 --> 00:51:20,800
- [Alan] David!

848
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:24,633
- [David] Alan!

849
00:51:28,334 --> 00:51:31,000
(Alan grunting)

850
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:33,700
- David!

851
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,300
David!

852
00:51:45,967 --> 00:51:48,733
(David grunting)

853
00:51:50,434 --> 00:51:53,400
(wave splashing)

854
00:51:55,267 --> 00:51:56,733
- [Riach] Gimme your hand.

855
00:51:56,766 --> 00:51:57,800
Come on.

856
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,933
- [Captain] Mr. Riach.

857
00:52:05,967 --> 00:52:08,700
(dramatic music)

858
00:52:14,866 --> 00:52:16,367
- David!

859
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,000
(men shouting)

860
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:21,400
David!

861
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:26,733
- On your oars, store that.

862
00:52:35,866 --> 00:52:37,367
Get out the boats.

863
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,733
(David grunting)

864
00:53:00,933 --> 00:53:03,800
(ship cracking)

865
00:53:09,866 --> 00:53:12,700
(waves splashing)

866
00:53:20,334 --> 00:53:21,167
- David!

867
00:53:27,033 --> 00:53:27,866
David!

868
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:33,666
David!

869
00:53:49,766 --> 00:53:51,267
- Breck!

870
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,766
The powder's dry.

871
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,700
Get moving.

872
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:56,766
Move.

873
00:54:01,434 --> 00:54:02,666
Go on.

874
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:04,633
Robbie.

875
00:54:06,766 --> 00:54:07,400
Search him.

876
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,133
Get the money.

877
00:54:13,967 --> 00:54:14,766
- There's nothing.

878
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,800
- It's with the boy.

879
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:16,866
- Then you've killed him.

880
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:20,300
- [Riach] Aye, with a weight like that round him,

881
00:54:20,334 --> 00:54:21,400
he'll drown for sure.

882
00:54:21,434 --> 00:54:24,666
- (laughing) Sunk like a stone.

883
00:54:28,033 --> 00:54:30,733
(punches thudding) (men grunting)

884
00:54:30,766 --> 00:54:34,000
(lively flute music)

885
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:36,666
(gun firing)

886
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,800
(birds chirping) (gentle music)

887
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,833
(waves splashing)

888
00:55:20,866 --> 00:55:23,700
(uplifting music)

889
00:55:29,133 --> 00:55:32,666
(somber rhythmic music)

890
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:37,567
- [Alan] Ewan?

891
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:38,766
- [Soldier] Go on after him.

892
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,900
Go on.

893
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:41,233
Bring him down.

894
00:55:41,267 --> 00:55:42,033
(gun firing)

895
00:55:42,067 --> 00:55:47,100
(horse whinnying) (Ewan grunting)

896
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,133
- [Soldier] After him.

897
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,833
Dismount.

898
00:55:53,733 --> 00:55:54,434
After him.

899
00:55:54,467 --> 00:55:55,700
Don't let him escape.

900
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:00,300
He's in the back of there.

901
00:56:00,334 --> 00:56:01,133
Go on.

902
00:56:06,733 --> 00:56:07,733
- [Ewan] Alan?

903
00:56:07,766 --> 00:56:08,633
(Alan grunting)

904
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:09,766
- [Alan] Let's get you away from here.

905
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,400
- [Ewan] Good, Alan.

906
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:12,000
- To the left.

907
00:56:12,033 --> 00:56:12,833
Guards up.

908
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,833
- There.

909
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,367
We've winged him anyway.

910
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,800
Half dead by the look of it.

911
00:56:24,833 --> 00:56:25,800
But, be alert, men.

912
00:56:31,067 --> 00:56:32,933
These Highlanders are full of tricks.

913
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,133
(birds squawking)

914
00:56:38,367 --> 00:56:39,900
- You're a day behind him.

915
00:56:41,033 --> 00:56:41,866
- He's alive?

916
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:46,167
- He had that appearance about him.

917
00:56:51,334 --> 00:56:53,800
- Well, which direction did he take?

918
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,733
- Westward.

919
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,800
Towards his own place.

920
00:57:00,033 --> 00:57:01,700
- And, what place would that be?

921
00:57:06,367 --> 00:57:10,967
- Well, I'll tell you since you bear his token.

922
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,633
Acharn, ah

923
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:23,233
(somber music)

924
00:57:26,267 --> 00:57:27,666
- [Alan] We'll be safe here.

925
00:57:28,866 --> 00:57:31,766
(Ewan groans)

926
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,200
- Alan, listen--

927
00:57:33,233 --> 00:57:34,700
- Hush now.

928
00:57:34,733 --> 00:57:36,000
- Your man, Reid.

929
00:57:36,033 --> 00:57:37,400
- You're in no case to talk.

930
00:57:37,434 --> 00:57:40,033
- There's a plot, something deep.

931
00:57:40,866 --> 00:57:41,700
A killing, Alan.

932
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,400
(groans)

933
00:57:43,434 --> 00:57:44,400
- [Alan] Who?

934
00:57:44,434 --> 00:57:47,700
- I have no name, but they'll lay the blame

935
00:57:47,733 --> 00:57:49,766
on James of the Glen.

936
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,167
- Easy, now, easy, lad.

937
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,633
- The 14th day of May.

938
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,700
The woods of Lettermore.

939
00:57:56,434 --> 00:57:57,434
(groans)

940
00:57:57,467 --> 00:58:00,766
- [Alan] Easy now.

941
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,067
Rest you here now, I'll fetch you a drink.

942
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,766
- You have a dram with you?

943
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,633
- [Alan] Water.

944
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:07,666
- Water.

945
00:58:14,367 --> 00:58:16,733
- [Alan] Ewan, Ewan.

946
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:27,800
(somber bagpipe music)

947
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:29,100
God rest your brave soul.

948
00:58:31,733 --> 00:58:32,367
- Acharn?

949
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,733
You'd go south by east through the woods of Lettermore.

950
00:58:36,766 --> 00:58:38,067
But, stay.

951
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,300
I take that road myself.

952
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,434
I'll walk with you.

953
00:58:41,467 --> 00:58:44,766
If you don't object to bear company with a blind man.

954
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
- Sir, I would be honored.

955
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:50,400
- Your speech tells me you're a stranger,

956
00:58:50,434 --> 00:58:52,200
a Lowlander perhaps.

957
00:58:53,267 --> 00:58:54,367
- Perhaps.

958
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,367
- Aye, that's a young man's voice.

959
00:58:58,334 --> 00:58:59,700
A gentleman's voice.

960
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:02,100
- Perhaps.

961
00:59:02,133 --> 00:59:05,200
- These are all my eyes, young master.

962
00:59:05,233 --> 00:59:06,800
May I know the look of you?

963
00:59:11,334 --> 00:59:12,400
- Go on.

964
00:59:12,434 --> 00:59:13,933
- Would you take my stick?

965
00:59:22,733 --> 00:59:27,700
Aye, you have the features of a true gentleman.

966
00:59:29,334 --> 00:59:32,400
(gentle flute music)

967
00:59:34,733 --> 00:59:35,700
- [Men] Aye.

968
00:59:35,733 --> 00:59:36,766
Aye.

969
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:45,267
(cow mooing) (calf bleating)

970
00:59:46,033 --> 00:59:49,733
- Is every Lowland man as silent as yourself, young master?

971
00:59:50,967 --> 00:59:53,000
(men chattering)

972
00:59:53,033 --> 00:59:55,000
- I was just observing these people here.

973
00:59:56,434 --> 00:59:58,733
They don't look like Highlanders at all.

974
00:59:58,766 --> 01:00:01,133
There's no tartan, no kilts on any of them.

975
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:03,267
- Did you not know that King George

976
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,700
has put a legal ban upon the Highland dress?

977
01:00:06,733 --> 01:00:10,033
Aye, no tartan, no kilt,

978
01:00:11,167 --> 01:00:12,400
no bagpipes neither.

979
01:00:13,766 --> 01:00:16,100
That's to break the spirit of the clans.

980
01:00:19,267 --> 01:00:20,067
(footsteps thudding)

981
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:20,933
- [Soldier] Left wheel.

982
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,800
- [Forbes] I'm afraid he's disappeared, sir.

983
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:26,200
- [William] Disappeared?

984
01:00:26,233 --> 01:00:27,833
- [Soldier] Hold your (mumbles).

985
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,067
- Men don't disappear, Captain Forbes.

986
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,400
- [Forbes] Evidently he had an accomplice.

987
01:00:33,434 --> 01:00:34,833
They didn't leave any tracks.

988
01:00:34,866 --> 01:00:36,434
- How badly was he wounded?

989
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:38,334
- Judging from the blood, mortally.

990
01:00:38,367 --> 01:00:40,666
- [Soldier] Pick up those (mumbles), pick 'em up!

991
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:41,334
- Let's hope so.

992
01:00:43,367 --> 01:00:45,133
Do you know who he was?

993
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:47,100
- A serving man in your kitchen?

994
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:47,967
- He was a spy.

995
01:00:48,866 --> 01:00:50,800
- [Soldier] Control, keep up the pace.

996
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:52,933
- He used the name Clousen, but his true name

997
01:00:52,967 --> 01:00:54,000
is Ewan of Appin.

998
01:00:57,434 --> 01:01:00,200
(birds chirping)

999
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,233
- Is that the song of a burn I hear?

1000
01:01:05,267 --> 01:01:06,666
- Aye, it is.

1001
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,400
- Would you be a Christian and fetch me

1002
01:01:08,434 --> 01:01:10,200
a sip of water, young master?

1003
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:11,334
- Aye, aye, of course.

1004
01:01:16,467 --> 01:01:19,233
(cup clattering)

1005
01:01:21,766 --> 01:01:22,766
(cane thudding)

1006
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,400
(David shouting)

1007
01:01:23,434 --> 01:01:26,267
(water splashing)

1008
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,866
(men grunting)

1009
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,167
(David laughing)

1010
01:02:05,367 --> 01:02:10,367
(sheep bleating) (gentle music)

1011
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:16,700
(water splashing) (dog barking)

1012
01:02:25,334 --> 01:02:27,033
- [Flora] Alan Breck.

1013
01:02:27,067 --> 01:02:28,133
- Well, Flora.

1014
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:29,233
- You can stop there.

1015
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,334
I don't know how you dare to show your face.

1016
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,267
- There's much I dare.

1017
01:02:37,033 --> 01:02:38,633
You've not forgotten surely.

1018
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:42,933
- I've not forgotten, nor forgiven, Alan.

1019
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,833
What do you want?

1020
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,766
- Just a bed for the night, if you have one.

1021
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,467
(sheep bleating)

1022
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,133
- [Flora] I do not, not for you.

1023
01:03:02,766 --> 01:03:03,900
- And, where is Donald?

1024
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:06,067
- Donald is in London.

1025
01:03:07,933 --> 01:03:09,267
- Why London?

1026
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,000
- He has a petition to King George

1027
01:03:11,033 --> 01:03:12,300
to restore his estate.

1028
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,900
- The King is in France, Flora.

1029
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,400
- We've scrimped and starved long enough.

1030
01:03:23,434 --> 01:03:24,467
We have a bairn.

1031
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,400
- I can believe a wee pluck of a man like Donald

1032
01:03:26,434 --> 01:03:28,067
would bend his knee to King George.

1033
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,766
But, not you, Flora, just not you.

1034
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,067
- I'd have died for you Alan Breck.

1035
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,633
Such a love I had.

1036
01:03:35,334 --> 01:03:38,133
But, your king over the water whistled for you

1037
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:38,967
and you were gone.

1038
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,800
- My king?

1039
01:03:39,833 --> 01:03:42,666
Your king, your king.

1040
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,900
And, you sheltered his son, Prince Charlie himself

1041
01:03:45,933 --> 01:03:47,000
in your own father's house.

1042
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:49,700
- They burnt my father's house, they drove our people

1043
01:03:49,733 --> 01:03:50,367
off the land.

1044
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:55,100
I had no man to turn to save Donald.

1045
01:03:55,133 --> 01:03:57,666
A poor wee pluck of a man you called him.

1046
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,733
Well, he stood by me.

1047
01:04:00,766 --> 01:04:02,200
He wed me.

1048
01:04:02,233 --> 01:04:03,267
And, it cost him dear.

1049
01:04:05,434 --> 01:04:09,267
You left me naked, Alan, and that's the truth of it.

1050
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:23,733
(cries)

1051
01:04:25,733 --> 01:04:30,733
(dramatic music) (horse hooves clomping)

1052
01:04:40,367 --> 01:04:43,200
(horse whinnying)

1053
01:04:48,866 --> 01:04:50,233
- Oh, you're not ready, man.

1054
01:04:50,267 --> 01:04:51,100
It's 9:00.

1055
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,733
We've a long ride to Acharn.

1056
01:04:53,766 --> 01:04:56,267
Do you want to evict James The Glen or not?

1057
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,200
- I'm perfectly ready.

1058
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,933
- I see you like your comforts, Mr. Reid.

1059
01:05:05,967 --> 01:05:07,833
- Well, any fool can be uncomfortable.

1060
01:05:10,033 --> 01:05:15,033
(birds chirping) (gentle flute music)

1061
01:05:17,033 --> 01:05:19,700
(ominous music)

1062
01:05:47,067 --> 01:05:50,666
(horse hooves clacking)

1063
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,833
(rifle clacking)

1064
01:06:13,133 --> 01:06:16,666
(horse hooves clomping)

1065
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:24,900
- [David] Good day, sirs.

1066
01:06:24,933 --> 01:06:26,400
Good day to you both.

1067
01:06:26,434 --> 01:06:27,334
I'm bound for Acharn.

1068
01:06:27,367 --> 01:06:30,233
Can you tell me, is this the right road?

1069
01:06:30,267 --> 01:06:32,434
- [Colin] These are the roads of Lettermore, lad.

1070
01:06:32,467 --> 01:06:33,733
- What do you want in Acharn?

1071
01:06:34,434 --> 01:06:35,833
- A man who lives there.

1072
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:38,733
- And, who are you?

1073
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,900
- I'm an honest subject of King George, sir.

1074
01:06:42,933 --> 01:06:45,833
- Very well said, but if I might be so bold,

1075
01:06:46,733 --> 01:06:50,067
why is such an honest man so far from his own country?

1076
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,100
(guns firing) (horse whinnying)

1077
01:06:51,133 --> 01:06:53,866
(dramatic music)

1078
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:18,766
- Sir.

1079
01:07:20,033 --> 01:07:22,800
(Colin coughing)

1080
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,766
(rifle thudding)

1081
01:07:45,733 --> 01:07:46,933
For God sake, Mr. Reid.

1082
01:07:49,033 --> 01:07:49,833
Don't go!

1083
01:07:54,766 --> 01:07:55,866
- He's been shot.

1084
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,000
This boy's an accomplice.

1085
01:07:57,033 --> 01:07:57,900
- No I'm not.

1086
01:07:57,933 --> 01:07:59,300
- He was put here to keep us talking.

1087
01:07:59,334 --> 01:08:00,933
(dramatic music)

1088
01:08:00,967 --> 01:08:01,766
Get after him.

1089
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,067
- Sergeants, after him.

1090
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,666
(men shouting)

1091
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,267
- [Alan] David.

1092
01:08:16,267 --> 01:08:18,334
Come away, come away.

1093
01:08:18,367 --> 01:08:19,733
Go on, go, go!

1094
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:20,766
(guns firing)

1095
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,167
(men shouting)

1096
01:08:41,233 --> 01:08:43,633
(panting)

1097
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,233
They're not done.

1098
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:49,133
They'll lay this claim at James's door.

1099
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,733
They'll be making for Acharn.

1100
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:55,766
(David panting)

1101
01:08:59,967 --> 01:09:01,933
What the devil were you doing in the woods of Lettermore?

1102
01:09:01,967 --> 01:09:02,800
- Following you.

1103
01:09:05,233 --> 01:09:06,167
- Well, come away, man.

1104
01:09:08,367 --> 01:09:10,666
- You entrusted something to me which I felt

1105
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,334
it was my duty to return to you.

1106
01:09:12,367 --> 01:09:13,766
And, there it is.

1107
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:17,334
I thank you for getting me away but now we part.

1108
01:09:17,367 --> 01:09:19,000
- I'll hardly part from you, Davie.

1109
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,666
- There's a man lies dead down there.

1110
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,700
And, the weapon that slew him is there, in your hand.

1111
01:09:26,733 --> 01:09:28,733
- So, you think I killed him?

1112
01:09:28,766 --> 01:09:30,400
- Goodbye, Mr. Stewart.

1113
01:09:30,434 --> 01:09:32,334
I doubt that we shall ever meet again.

1114
01:09:33,267 --> 01:09:36,067
- David, where the devil do you think you're going?

1115
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:36,900
- [David] Home!

1116
01:09:36,933 --> 01:09:38,133
- Home?

1117
01:09:38,167 --> 01:09:40,400
Man, you're not gonna make five mile before they catch you.

1118
01:09:41,733 --> 01:09:42,700
- That's my affair.

1119
01:09:44,733 --> 01:09:46,733
- At least hear my defense.

1120
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:47,700
- Defense?

1121
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:49,766
What defense, what defense?

1122
01:09:50,733 --> 01:09:53,300
I liked you very, very well,

1123
01:09:53,334 --> 01:09:58,000
but your ways are not mine and they are not God's.

1124
01:09:58,033 --> 01:10:00,633
(somber music)

1125
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,300
(gentle flute music)

1126
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:19,434
(ominous music)

1127
01:10:19,467 --> 01:10:20,800
- [Soldier] Halt or we shoot.

1128
01:10:29,233 --> 01:10:31,800
Come on you.

1129
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:46,233
- Now that we've got you, let's have your name.

1130
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,800
- Breck, Alan Breck!

1131
01:10:52,866 --> 01:10:54,233
Would you have the goodness to order your men

1132
01:10:54,267 --> 01:10:55,866
to lay down their arms, Captain?

1133
01:10:59,833 --> 01:11:01,033
- Do it.

1134
01:11:01,067 --> 01:11:02,000
- Ground your arms.

1135
01:11:04,067 --> 01:11:04,967
- And, your sword.

1136
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:10,900
If you please.

1137
01:11:12,233 --> 01:11:14,967
(sword clanking)

1138
01:11:19,267 --> 01:11:20,800
Would you walk with me, sir?

1139
01:11:27,434 --> 01:11:30,334
- You'd be well-advised to shoot me now, Mr. Stewart.

1140
01:11:30,367 --> 01:11:32,100
- What, shoot a man in cold blood?

1141
01:11:32,133 --> 01:11:33,833
Is that what the English do?

1142
01:11:33,866 --> 01:11:35,766
It's not the Highland way, Mr. Reid.

1143
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,633
- [William] Fatal flaw

1144
01:11:36,666 --> 01:11:38,200
in the Highland character, Mr. Stewart.

1145
01:11:38,233 --> 01:11:41,933
- (chuckles) Well, perhaps I should shoot you.

1146
01:11:45,766 --> 01:11:47,200
(rifle clicking)

1147
01:11:47,233 --> 01:11:49,000
But, it's not loaded.

1148
01:11:49,033 --> 01:11:51,300
(adventurous music)

1149
01:11:51,334 --> 01:11:52,167
As you see.

1150
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,367
- [David] Why don't we keep the horses?

1151
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,167
- Because we're safer on foot.

1152
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:24,434
- You are the boldest peacock of a man

1153
01:12:24,467 --> 01:12:26,300
I've ever come across.

1154
01:12:26,334 --> 01:12:28,733
And, it seems I have to thank you once again.

1155
01:12:29,467 --> 01:12:32,300
But, I can't change my opinion.

1156
01:12:32,334 --> 01:12:34,666
You killed a man in cold blood.

1157
01:12:39,434 --> 01:12:40,967
- [Alan] You know who that man was?

1158
01:12:42,133 --> 01:12:44,300
- It was a man, an innocent man.

1159
01:12:44,334 --> 01:12:45,733
- He was your King's Factor.

1160
01:12:47,733 --> 01:12:48,833
- That's your defense?

1161
01:12:48,866 --> 01:12:51,334
- Now, I tell you, Mr. Balfour of Shaws as a friend,

1162
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,367
if I were about to kill Campbell of Glenure,

1163
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:56,267
it would not be in Stewart's country to bring trouble

1164
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:57,167
on my own people.

1165
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,800
- What trouble?

1166
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:01,267
- I told you William Reid will lay this murder

1167
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,967
at the door of my kinsmen.

1168
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,233
He'll hang 'em if he can.

1169
01:13:05,133 --> 01:13:06,967
He'll throw his people off the land.

1170
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,733
- With no proof.

1171
01:13:08,766 --> 01:13:09,633
- He's a Stewart.

1172
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:12,133
Can you understand that?

1173
01:13:14,133 --> 01:13:14,967
That's the proof.

1174
01:13:21,866 --> 01:13:23,967
- Well, how did you come by that gun then?

1175
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:27,267
- The murderer struck me a blow with it.

1176
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,367
He ran off before I could see his face.

1177
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,167
Here, you can see for yourself of the blow there.

1178
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,933
- Aye, well you've taken a knock certainly.

1179
01:13:37,967 --> 01:13:40,800
- Ah, what would you have me do, swear upon the holy cross?

1180
01:13:42,067 --> 01:13:42,900
I'll do it.

1181
01:13:45,067 --> 01:13:46,033
(stream gurgling)

1182
01:13:46,067 --> 01:13:48,900
- No, I believe you and I thank God for it now.

1183
01:13:48,933 --> 01:13:49,833
- Stop right there.

1184
01:13:51,933 --> 01:13:54,100
Do you know you never let me speak my defense

1185
01:13:57,467 --> 01:13:58,733
before condemning me.

1186
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,800
(somber music)

1187
01:14:06,766 --> 01:14:11,000
- I was here in our cairn when the murder was done.

1188
01:14:11,033 --> 01:14:13,434
I've a score of my people to swear to it.

1189
01:14:13,467 --> 01:14:15,733
- Aye, your people, James,

1190
01:14:16,434 --> 01:14:18,400
Stewarts of Appin.

1191
01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:20,666
This is a Campbell that's been killed.

1192
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:21,500
- Listen to him, James.

1193
01:14:21,534 --> 01:14:23,267
- You will be tried at Fort William.

1194
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,766
There'll be 15 Campbells in the jury box

1195
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,967
and the biggest Campbell of them all

1196
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,800
the Duke of Argyle on the bench.

1197
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:29,700
- Oh, for God sake. - Now, you'll take

1198
01:14:29,733 --> 01:14:31,434
to the heather with me away to France.

1199
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,666
- No.

1200
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:33,766
- It's best, James.

1201
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:34,933
- [James] Hold your tongue, woman.

1202
01:14:34,967 --> 01:14:37,200
- How many times must I tell ya?

1203
01:14:37,233 --> 01:14:39,200
This is a plot by Reid.

1204
01:14:40,334 --> 01:14:41,633
Now, he won't be thwarted.

1205
01:14:42,866 --> 01:14:44,100
He'll see you hanged.

1206
01:14:44,133 --> 01:14:44,967
- Redcoats.

1207
01:14:46,866 --> 01:14:47,700
- Will you run?

1208
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,233
- No.

1209
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,434
- Then we fight.

1210
01:14:55,467 --> 01:14:58,233
(dramatic music)

1211
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:06,067
- [James] This is madness, Alan.

1212
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:07,133
- [Alan] Of your making.

1213
01:15:07,167 --> 01:15:09,700
- [James] You're not the chieftain here, curse you.

1214
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:14,334
- It'll give you time, man.

1215
01:15:14,367 --> 01:15:15,567
- [James] For what?

1216
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,000
- To din some sense into that stubborn old head of yours.

1217
01:15:19,033 --> 01:15:20,233
- [Alan] Put it in here, lads.

1218
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:47,133
- Halt!

1219
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:51,866
Fix bayonets!

1220
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:53,400
- Fix bayonets!

1221
01:15:53,434 --> 01:15:56,633
(bayonets clanking)

1222
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,267
Fixed!

1223
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,434
- Forward march!

1224
01:16:06,467 --> 01:16:09,633
(drumming music)

1225
01:16:18,434 --> 01:16:20,200
(dog barking)

1226
01:16:20,233 --> 01:16:23,766
(horse hooves clomping)

1227
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:38,666
- [Soldier] They've gone.

1228
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:40,733
- [Alan] Not quite!

1229
01:16:46,367 --> 01:16:48,933
(dogs barking)

1230
01:16:58,067 --> 01:16:58,900
- This is folly.

1231
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:04,800
Lay down your arms.

1232
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:07,400
- You'd best lay down your own.

1233
01:17:16,766 --> 01:17:17,700
You'd be wise to.

1234
01:17:20,334 --> 01:17:25,334
(crowd cheering) (dramatic music)

1235
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,367
- [James] They'll be back, Alan, with more soldiers.

1236
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,167
(crowd cheering)

1237
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,800
(dogs barking)

1238
01:17:43,067 --> 01:17:48,067
(crowd cheering) (bagpipe music)

1239
01:18:04,766 --> 01:18:05,967
(rooster crowing)

1240
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,733
(birds cackling)

1241
01:18:13,133 --> 01:18:15,766
(cow mooing)

1242
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:20,367
(fife and drum music)

1243
01:18:23,733 --> 01:18:26,866
(horse hooves clomping)

1244
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:45,967
- Alan, Alan!

1245
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:47,866
- I know.

1246
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:48,967
It's death to stay.

1247
01:18:50,967 --> 01:18:52,866
- You and your friends slip away now

1248
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,300
while you have the chance.

1249
01:18:54,334 --> 01:18:56,833
- We'll hang together, James.

1250
01:18:56,866 --> 01:18:58,800
- For once in your life, Alan Breck,

1251
01:18:58,833 --> 01:18:59,833
you'll listen to me.

1252
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:03,967
For the sake of my people, I'll give myself over.

1253
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,200
- Why do you persist?

1254
01:19:11,233 --> 01:19:12,233
- Listen to me!

1255
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:17,733
I have only one hope for my life and that's you.

1256
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,000
Find the one who did the murder.

1257
01:19:23,033 --> 01:19:25,167
If any man in Scotland can do it, you can.

1258
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,700
Find him.

1259
01:19:27,733 --> 01:19:30,766
Produce him to the court with proof of the plot.

1260
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,700
And, no Campbell jury can ever hang me.

1261
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:41,800
(horse snorting) (horse hooves clomping)

1262
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,334
I am James Stewart of the Glen.

1263
01:20:07,866 --> 01:20:11,200
- Come on, you (mumbles)! (dramatic music)

1264
01:20:13,233 --> 01:20:18,233
(people shouting) (baby crying)

1265
01:20:34,067 --> 01:20:35,666
- For the love of God, Mr. Reid.

1266
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,000
- We must cleanse the Highlands, Captain Forbes.

1267
01:20:39,033 --> 01:20:43,400
That's my duty and it's your duty.

1268
01:20:43,434 --> 01:20:46,000
(men shouting)

1269
01:21:00,733 --> 01:21:02,733
- You see King George's men at their work?

1270
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:04,900
Where do you stand now,

1271
01:21:08,033 --> 01:21:09,233
Mr. Betwixt and Between?

1272
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:14,300
(fire crackling)

1273
01:21:28,033 --> 01:21:31,666
- Just find the real murderer and drag him into court.

1274
01:21:32,434 --> 01:21:34,800
That doesn't sound simple to me at all.

1275
01:21:35,434 --> 01:21:37,334
Unless you have some sort of clue.

1276
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,200
- Well, I'd be something of a fool

1277
01:21:41,233 --> 01:21:43,866
to set about this business if I'd not.

1278
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,700
For all that is a dangerous game

1279
01:21:46,967 --> 01:21:48,733
and you're not obliged to play.

1280
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:50,833
- Do I have a choice?

1281
01:21:50,866 --> 01:21:52,000
- You do, you've a lot.

1282
01:21:53,067 --> 01:21:55,866
They haven't your name and our friends

1283
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:58,067
will see you safe into the Lowlands.

1284
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:00,900
- James of the Glen is as innocent of murder

1285
01:22:00,933 --> 01:22:02,666
as I am myself.

1286
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:07,367
As a gentleman, I could say as an honest subject

1287
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,367
of King George,

1288
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:13,233
but I say as a gentleman,

1289
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:18,067
it is my duty to see justice done if I can.

1290
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,766
- Well, that's well said, lad.

1291
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:28,766
My hand's on that.

1292
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,666
(gentle flute music)

1293
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:34,900
You'll hold this gold for me again then.

1294
01:22:34,933 --> 01:22:35,766
- If you like.

1295
01:22:37,334 --> 01:22:38,233
Why?

1296
01:22:38,267 --> 01:22:39,100
- I don't know.

1297
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:44,634
I see you're honest, but I think you're the luck.

1298
01:22:47,133 --> 01:22:47,933
- Luck?

1299
01:22:47,967 --> 01:22:49,434
- Aye, the luck.

1300
01:22:49,467 --> 01:22:52,666
- Since I've left Essendean I've been assaulted,

1301
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:57,766
I've been kidnapped, my uncle tried to murder me.

1302
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,933
I've been attacked by a blind man

1303
01:22:59,967 --> 01:23:04,267
and I've been chased and harried half out of my wits.

1304
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:06,000
- That's exactly my meaning.

1305
01:23:06,033 --> 01:23:08,700
It's a bloody miracle you're alive, man.

1306
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:10,300
Now, fall in and step to.

1307
01:23:10,334 --> 01:23:13,167
(water splashing)

1308
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:15,434
- Where are we going?

1309
01:23:15,467 --> 01:23:16,700
- Fort William.

1310
01:23:17,467 --> 01:23:18,933
- But, that's a garrison town.

1311
01:23:18,967 --> 01:23:20,400
It's fully of Redcoats.

1312
01:23:20,434 --> 01:23:21,700
- Aye, and it's the last place in Scotland

1313
01:23:21,733 --> 01:23:23,733
they'll be thinking to look for us.

1314
01:23:23,766 --> 01:23:25,400
(mysterious music)

1315
01:23:25,434 --> 01:23:27,334
- I say, Tom, come on.

1316
01:23:27,367 --> 01:23:29,267
- [Tom] That's a rather fine pistol.

1317
01:23:30,267 --> 01:23:32,766
- Not half as fine as the tavern I've got my eye on.

1318
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:33,634
Come on.

1319
01:23:39,334 --> 01:23:40,866
- [Woman] Well give him something, Harriet.

1320
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:41,866
- [Harriet] And, here you are now

1321
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:45,634
and mind you buy food. - Ah, thank you, dear.

1322
01:23:51,133 --> 01:23:53,733
(bell ringing)

1323
01:23:59,233 --> 01:24:01,167
- It's an odd made piece, Alan.

1324
01:24:02,733 --> 01:24:03,766
Very odd.

1325
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,434
I've seen nothing like it before.

1326
01:24:08,467 --> 01:24:11,133
(bird chirping)

1327
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,200
Are you selling it?

1328
01:24:13,233 --> 01:24:14,133
- For shame, Angus.

1329
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,000
And, you an elder of the church.

1330
01:24:18,033 --> 01:24:19,067
- I'll take a bible oath--

1331
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:21,000
- I've no time! (glass clattering)

1332
01:24:21,033 --> 01:24:22,400
- Now, you tell me the name of the man you made it for.

1333
01:24:22,434 --> 01:24:24,000
- I never knew his name.

1334
01:24:24,033 --> 01:24:25,400
He would've been a fool to give it

1335
01:24:25,434 --> 01:24:27,666
and I would've been a greater fool to ask it.

1336
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:29,434
- I'm gonna use that

1337
01:24:29,467 --> 01:24:32,133
to blow out that canny brain of yours.

1338
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:33,833
- Well, I can give you his clan.

1339
01:24:33,866 --> 01:24:35,167
- Give me the name.

1340
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,434
- Well, it was a Campbell killed--

1341
01:24:37,467 --> 01:24:38,300
- A MacDonald?

1342
01:24:39,233 --> 01:24:41,733
- Yes, a MacDonald he was.

1343
01:24:49,733 --> 01:24:52,766
- Mr. Reid. (ominous music)

1344
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:01,200
- Sir, I know where Alan Breck Stewart is.

1345
01:25:01,233 --> 01:25:03,967
- No, sir, I've not seen a living soul all morning.

1346
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:07,400
- Trade bad, is it?

1347
01:25:10,833 --> 01:25:12,700
- Terrible bad, sir.

1348
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:13,933
- As bad as your memory.

1349
01:25:15,766 --> 01:25:18,334
(bag thudding)

1350
01:25:22,067 --> 01:25:24,800
(dramatic music)

1351
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,367
- Could I crave one favor of you, Davie?

1352
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,300
- [David] Of course.

1353
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:31,200
- Well, let's just say the less you know

1354
01:25:31,233 --> 01:25:32,967
you notice here now, the better for me.

1355
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,400
Duncan MacDonald is no open-mined man.

1356
01:25:35,434 --> 01:25:37,733
He's no time for Lowlanders and he hates King George

1357
01:25:37,766 --> 01:25:38,766
worse than poison.

1358
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,700
I hope I don't offend you.

1359
01:25:39,733 --> 01:25:40,434
- [David] Certainly not.

1360
01:25:40,467 --> 01:25:42,300
(loud knocking)

1361
01:25:42,334 --> 01:25:44,866
- Still he was once the power here, you see?

1362
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:46,033
He was the clan chief.

1363
01:25:49,334 --> 01:25:50,167
Just not now.

1364
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,800
Good evening to you, miss.

1365
01:25:53,833 --> 01:25:54,833
- Sir.

1366
01:25:54,866 --> 01:25:56,833
- My name is Alan Breck Stewart.

1367
01:25:56,866 --> 01:25:57,500
- I know the name.

1368
01:25:57,534 --> 01:25:59,800
- Aye, is the Earl at home?

1369
01:26:00,933 --> 01:26:02,733
- He is.

1370
01:26:02,766 --> 01:26:04,900
- Might I crave 10 minutes conversation with him?

1371
01:26:05,733 --> 01:26:07,766
- Come in sir, sirs.

1372
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:17,000
A moment if you please, Mr. Stewart.

1373
01:26:21,467 --> 01:26:24,334
(soft knocking)

1374
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,733
- That man had five sons and he lost them all.

1375
01:26:32,467 --> 01:26:34,167
And, that be the granddaughter, Mary.

1376
01:26:35,866 --> 01:26:36,733
One bonny lassie.

1377
01:26:37,733 --> 01:26:38,733
- Oh, she's all right.

1378
01:26:38,766 --> 01:26:39,634
- You don't agree?

1379
01:26:40,634 --> 01:26:42,200
- Well, I've hardly had time to form an opinion.

1380
01:26:42,233 --> 01:26:44,733
- Well, how much time do you need?

1381
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:46,334
A glance is enough I always say

1382
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:48,067
if a lad likes the look of a lass

1383
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:52,334
and a lass likes the look of a lad.

1384
01:26:52,367 --> 01:26:53,766
(door clattering)

1385
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,634
- You may go in now, Mr. Stewart.

1386
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:01,300
- [Alan] Thank you.

1387
01:27:02,367 --> 01:27:04,833
- Will you take some refreshment, sir?

1388
01:27:04,866 --> 01:27:06,700
- Uh, no, no thank you.

1389
01:27:06,733 --> 01:27:08,400
(gentle music)

1390
01:27:08,434 --> 01:27:10,833
- So, you're not accustomed to Highland manners.

1391
01:27:12,233 --> 01:27:14,434
It's a great tradition here to offer hospitality

1392
01:27:14,467 --> 01:27:18,967
to a stranger and a great offense for a

1393
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,733
- Oh, I apologize, Miss MacDonald.

1394
01:27:23,334 --> 01:27:24,700
- May I know your name?

1395
01:27:27,866 --> 01:27:30,367
There are bills posted around every town and village

1396
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,334
for the capture of Alan Breck Stewart and his companion.

1397
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:44,300
- My name is David Balfour of Shaws.

1398
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,967
- Honored, Mr. Balfour. - If never I cared.

1399
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,033
They can hang him 50 times over!

1400
01:27:51,067 --> 01:27:53,800
Now, be gone from my house, sir, be gone.

1401
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:55,100
- There've been grievances between us,

1402
01:27:55,133 --> 01:27:56,300
that's the past.

1403
01:27:56,334 --> 01:27:57,866
- Grievances?

1404
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:59,233
There's been bloodshed.

1405
01:27:59,267 --> 01:28:00,434
- Let's bury 'em now while there's time.

1406
01:28:00,467 --> 01:28:02,100
We still have a common cause.

1407
01:28:03,033 --> 01:28:06,033
- I don't believe any kin of mind had a hand in the murder.

1408
01:28:06,067 --> 01:28:07,700
But, if one did then I honor him for sending

1409
01:28:07,733 --> 01:28:09,300
another Campbell to hell.

1410
01:28:09,334 --> 01:28:12,434
- James of the Glen is on a rope here, man!

1411
01:28:12,467 --> 01:28:14,200
- Begone from my house.

1412
01:28:16,334 --> 01:28:17,200
- Curse on you.

1413
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,033
You're a fool.

1414
01:28:20,033 --> 01:28:22,033
Gotta go back to Fort William now to get him.

1415
01:28:22,067 --> 01:28:23,200
- What? - It's always the same.

1416
01:28:23,233 --> 01:28:24,167
You look for help, you get none.

1417
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,666
It always comes down to this.

1418
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:27,434
- Are you mad altogether?

1419
01:28:27,467 --> 01:28:29,733
They'll guard him as closely as the Crown Jewels.

1420
01:28:29,766 --> 01:28:31,200
- Closer, I should think.

1421
01:28:31,233 --> 01:28:34,700
Mr. Stewart, I have a kinsman, Hamish MacDonald.

1422
01:28:34,733 --> 01:28:36,000
- Mary!

1423
01:28:36,033 --> 01:28:37,233
Get you back to the house.

1424
01:28:37,267 --> 01:28:40,100
And you, get off my land before I shoot you.

1425
01:28:40,133 --> 01:28:43,200
- Tell them, Grandfather, tell them Hamish shot him.

1426
01:28:43,233 --> 01:28:44,267
- Mary, get back to the house.

1427
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:45,833
- Will you shoot me if I don't?

1428
01:28:45,866 --> 01:28:47,400
- By the living God, I'd be justified.

1429
01:28:47,434 --> 01:28:49,067
You've betrayed your own kin.

1430
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:50,267
- My kin?

1431
01:28:51,267 --> 01:28:52,766
What kin?

1432
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,267
Who's left?

1433
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,400
- Get away, girl.

1434
01:28:55,434 --> 01:28:56,967
- Where's my father?

1435
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,067
Dead.

1436
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,000
Where's my mother?

1437
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:01,400
Dead, through grief like your own wife.

1438
01:29:01,434 --> 01:29:02,733
Where are your sons?

1439
01:29:02,766 --> 01:29:03,766
Dead.

1440
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,133
Dead, dead.

1441
01:29:05,167 --> 01:29:07,900
You killed them all with your blood feuds

1442
01:29:07,933 --> 01:29:10,766
and your damnable obstinate murderous pride.

1443
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,800
- I will help you to bring him to justice.

1444
01:29:18,367 --> 01:29:20,833
You'll find him at the head of Glen Cuillish.

1445
01:29:20,866 --> 01:29:21,967
Go by way of Kinkelly.

1446
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,267
There's a path leading over Lauchran.

1447
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,000
You'll find him at the head of the Glen.

1448
01:29:27,033 --> 01:29:29,700
- It's strange, I never heard of any such a path.

1449
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,733
- You think you know everything, Alan Breck.

1450
01:29:34,866 --> 01:29:36,233
Mary will show you the way.

1451
01:29:38,833 --> 01:29:40,434
- There's porridge made, Grandfather

1452
01:29:40,467 --> 01:29:42,200
and cold beef and cheese in the larder.

1453
01:29:42,233 --> 01:29:43,067
- Ah wee girl.

1454
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:46,233
If you kill him, Alan Breck,

1455
01:29:47,933 --> 01:29:49,634
I'll hunt you down like a dog.

1456
01:29:51,367 --> 01:29:54,666
- Well, why rob the hangman of his fee?

1457
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,233
- [Soldier] Ten shun.

1458
01:29:58,434 --> 01:29:59,766
Shoulder arms.

1459
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:04,700
Order!

1460
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:05,367
- They've been seen.

1461
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:11,100
Here, here, here, and here.

1462
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,367
- That's Duncan MacDonald's land,

1463
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,400
the Earl of Dunbrae.

1464
01:30:15,766 --> 01:30:17,400
- You're very well informed.

1465
01:30:17,434 --> 01:30:19,167
- I have been here three years.

1466
01:30:20,334 --> 01:30:22,334
The MacDonalds of Dunbrae and the Stewarts of Appin

1467
01:30:22,367 --> 01:30:23,334
are clan enemies.

1468
01:30:24,766 --> 01:30:26,133
Mind you the old earl has some feud or other

1469
01:30:26,167 --> 01:30:28,067
against half the Highlands.

1470
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:28,933
- Good.

1471
01:30:30,033 --> 01:30:30,933
- [Forbes] Why so?

1472
01:30:32,866 --> 01:30:37,267
- Mark 3:25, if a house be divided against itself,

1473
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:38,967
that house cannot stand.

1474
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,400
A difficult old relic like the Earl

1475
01:30:40,434 --> 01:30:41,733
is worth a regiment to us.

1476
01:30:42,733 --> 01:30:44,833
- Yes, I see what you mean.

1477
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:49,233
I hear you're to be made the King's Factor.

1478
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:52,733
- Nothing's been decided.

1479
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,400
- I think you're a man who gets what he wants.

1480
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,700
- Oh, that's because I never allow myself to want

1481
01:30:59,733 --> 01:31:01,367
what I think I cannot get.

1482
01:31:05,367 --> 01:31:07,700
- Is Shaws a very great place, Mr. Balfour?

1483
01:31:07,733 --> 01:31:09,666
- I believe it is, yes.

1484
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,100
- You don't know?

1485
01:31:11,133 --> 01:31:14,133
- My uncle has the house and lands at present.

1486
01:31:14,167 --> 01:31:15,933
- Ah, and you're his heir.

1487
01:31:17,133 --> 01:31:18,800
- I believe I am the legal owner.

1488
01:31:20,233 --> 01:31:24,300
When my father died, I discovered that

1489
01:31:24,334 --> 01:31:25,800
and my uncle the younger.

1490
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:27,700
- Yet, he has the property.

1491
01:31:27,733 --> 01:31:28,833
- Company. - Well, that's strange.

1492
01:31:28,866 --> 01:31:31,400
- Regiment mount up. (tense music)

1493
01:31:31,434 --> 01:31:33,766
- There has been some great wrong, Miss MacDonald, some--

1494
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:35,666
- [Alan] Get down!

1495
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,367
- [Soldier] Advance!

1496
01:31:41,733 --> 01:31:44,634
Keep your (mumbles).

1497
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,700
Keep your eyes peeled now.

1498
01:31:48,733 --> 01:31:49,733
- [Soldier] There he is!

1499
01:31:49,766 --> 01:31:50,534
(soldier shouting)

1500
01:31:50,567 --> 01:31:52,733
- Take your aim and fire. - Fire.

1501
01:31:52,766 --> 01:31:53,367
- [Soldier] Farther up!

1502
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:56,700
(guns firing)

1503
01:31:56,733 --> 01:31:57,933
- [Soldier] Advance!

1504
01:31:57,967 --> 01:32:01,200
(dramatic music)

1505
01:32:01,233 --> 01:32:03,400
- [Soldier] Pull bayonets!

1506
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:12,800
(swords clanking) (men grunting)

1507
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:15,167
(David shouting)

1508
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,033
- [Mary] David!

1509
01:32:17,067 --> 01:32:18,167
- Alan!

1510
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,400
- Watch out!

1511
01:32:19,434 --> 01:32:24,766
(David shouting) (swords clanking)

1512
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,367
(men grunting)

1513
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,267
(kicks thudding)

1514
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:29,233
(men shouting)

1515
01:32:29,267 --> 01:32:30,766
(swords clanking)

1516
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,167
(men shouting)

1517
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,167
- Come on, come on!

1518
01:32:51,467 --> 01:32:52,666
- What happened?

1519
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:53,367
- It was them all right, sir.

1520
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,900
And, there was a girl with them.

1521
01:32:56,866 --> 01:32:57,666
(horse hooves clomping)

1522
01:32:57,700 --> 01:33:00,800
(soldier shouting)

1523
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,733
- What girl?

1524
01:33:07,766 --> 01:33:08,634
- I have no idea.

1525
01:33:11,766 --> 01:33:13,700
They must've been making for Glen Cuillish.

1526
01:33:13,733 --> 01:33:15,400
(fire crackling)

1527
01:33:15,434 --> 01:33:17,100
Why on Earth would they do that?

1528
01:33:21,334 --> 01:33:23,800
- Well, it'll be trouble if we don't get there before them.

1529
01:33:24,866 --> 01:33:27,634
We still have a chance to catch Alan Breck Stewart.

1530
01:33:29,766 --> 01:33:32,833
(gentle flute music)

1531
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:41,000
- I'm no fighting man and I never pretended to be.

1532
01:33:41,033 --> 01:33:42,900
- Then you should learn to be.

1533
01:33:42,933 --> 01:33:45,833
If you want justice for yourself with your uncle as you say.

1534
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:50,167
- In the Lowlands, Miss MacDonald, we don't get justice

1535
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,666
through the sword.

1536
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:53,000
- [Mary] How do you get it then?

1537
01:33:53,033 --> 01:33:53,833
- Through the law.

1538
01:33:53,866 --> 01:33:54,833
- The law?

1539
01:33:54,866 --> 01:33:56,733
- Aye, the law.

1540
01:33:56,766 --> 01:34:00,133
Because we are civilized people, not savages.

1541
01:34:04,067 --> 01:34:07,133
(gentle flute music)

1542
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:13,666
- I've always heard tell of you

1543
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:15,400
as a great fighting man, Mr. Stewart.

1544
01:34:15,434 --> 01:34:16,900
- [Alan] Aye.

1545
01:34:16,933 --> 01:34:18,267
- The best in the Highlands.

1546
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:20,400
- [Alan] Oh, you could say I was born to it.

1547
01:34:20,434 --> 01:34:22,434
- I've heard tell of you since I was a child.

1548
01:34:22,467 --> 01:34:24,434
(Alan chuckles)

1549
01:34:24,467 --> 01:34:26,267
You fought at Culloden, did you not?

1550
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:28,933
- Aye.

1551
01:34:31,267 --> 01:34:32,100
I did.

1552
01:34:33,267 --> 01:34:35,967
- Even my grandfather would speak of you with respect.

1553
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,100
- (chuckles) Well, that's pleasing to know.

1554
01:34:39,334 --> 01:34:41,400
I think a man could be judged for other qualities

1555
01:34:41,434 --> 01:34:43,933
more than his handiness with a sword.

1556
01:34:43,967 --> 01:34:45,000
- Are you going to speak in defense

1557
01:34:45,033 --> 01:34:47,666
of your friend, Mr. Stewart? - He's a young man.

1558
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:48,534
- That's noble of you.

1559
01:34:48,567 --> 01:34:49,900
- He's got considerable book learning.

1560
01:34:49,933 --> 01:34:51,700
- Do you place a value on that?

1561
01:34:51,733 --> 01:34:53,100
- I do.

1562
01:34:53,133 --> 01:34:55,100
I wish I'd more of that in line myself.

1563
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:58,666
I think he's a gentleman, too.

1564
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:01,100
(somber music)

1565
01:35:10,733 --> 01:35:12,733
- [Mary] Be careful, we're nearly there.

1566
01:35:22,233 --> 01:35:23,167
That's where he is.

1567
01:35:25,434 --> 01:35:27,200
- Does your cousin know you well by sight?

1568
01:35:27,233 --> 01:35:28,200
- Aye, he does.

1569
01:35:28,233 --> 01:35:29,766
- Be best I go alone.

1570
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:30,400
- No, I'll come with you.

1571
01:35:30,434 --> 01:35:32,133
- No, you wait here.

1572
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:41,367
- If Hamish MacDonald is a dangerous man,

1573
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:42,700
Alan Breck is a brave one.

1574
01:35:43,434 --> 01:35:44,800
- Or foolhardy.

1575
01:35:45,434 --> 01:35:47,133
- He knows fine what he's capable of.

1576
01:35:47,167 --> 01:35:49,100
You can't call such a man foolhardy.

1577
01:35:53,233 --> 01:35:55,666
- You seem to admire him greatly, Miss MacDonald.

1578
01:35:56,434 --> 01:35:58,733
- Don't you, Mr. Balfour?

1579
01:35:58,766 --> 01:35:59,800
(swords clattering)

1580
01:35:59,833 --> 01:36:00,434
(wind whistling)

1581
01:36:00,467 --> 01:36:03,334
(ominous music)

1582
01:36:12,434 --> 01:36:15,200
(birds chirping)

1583
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:20,334
(roof clattering)

1584
01:37:24,367 --> 01:37:25,400
- Wheest!

1585
01:37:25,434 --> 01:37:27,233
- [David] What?

1586
01:37:27,267 --> 01:37:27,900
What is it?

1587
01:37:27,933 --> 01:37:29,067
- Will you hold your noise?

1588
01:37:31,733 --> 01:37:33,434
(horse hooves clacking)

1589
01:37:33,467 --> 01:37:35,067
Oh, we'll have to warn them.

1590
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,666
- His own ears will warn him.

1591
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:37,634
- Are you a coward?

1592
01:37:38,733 --> 01:37:39,700
- Use your brains, woman.

1593
01:37:39,733 --> 01:37:40,967
There's nothing to be done.

1594
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,300
- Take your hand off me.

1595
01:37:44,167 --> 01:37:49,167
- Now, Mr. MacDonald, let me tell you what's to be.

1596
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:51,766
You and I will go to Fort William

1597
01:37:52,933 --> 01:37:55,766
and you'll swear a statement before the justice

1598
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:56,900
and you'll tell the truth.

1599
01:37:58,067 --> 01:37:59,634
You killed Campbell of Glenure.

1600
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:04,067
For money. (Hamish choking)

1601
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,634
Now, who paid you?

1602
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:11,700
Was it William Reid?

1603
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:24,634
- MacDonald.

1604
01:38:45,766 --> 01:38:48,800
- Alan Breck Stewart, I arrest you

1605
01:38:48,833 --> 01:38:50,067
in the name of King George.

1606
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:54,267
- Well, while you're about it, you may arrest this man, too.

1607
01:38:55,434 --> 01:38:56,733
His name is MacDonald.

1608
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,733
He murdered the Red Fox.

1609
01:38:59,766 --> 01:39:00,634
- What are you talking about?

1610
01:39:00,666 --> 01:39:04,067
- He was paid to do it by a gentleman

1611
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:06,800
of your acquaintance, Mr. William Reid.

1612
01:39:07,967 --> 01:39:10,766
- Let go of that man!

1613
01:39:16,067 --> 01:39:18,666
(gun firing)

1614
01:39:25,866 --> 01:39:28,634
(sword clanking)

1615
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,300
- Well, he attacked me.

1616
01:39:35,334 --> 01:39:36,167
Self defense.

1617
01:39:40,733 --> 01:39:43,300
(sword clanking)

1618
01:39:47,833 --> 01:39:50,766
(dramatic music)

1619
01:39:51,766 --> 01:39:54,800
(horses snorting)

1620
01:39:57,267 --> 01:39:59,233
- [Soldier] Company at the trot.

1621
01:40:06,267 --> 01:40:09,133
- I assume you have a family crest, Mr. Balfour of Shaws.

1622
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,634
I suggest a new motto for it in Latin, of course.

1623
01:40:14,733 --> 01:40:15,900
There's nothing to be done.

1624
01:40:17,334 --> 01:40:20,666
(horse hooves clomping)

1625
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:27,733
(door clattering)

1626
01:40:47,434 --> 01:40:48,567
- Unfortunately, you're to be tried

1627
01:40:48,601 --> 01:40:52,800
in Edinburgh, Mr. Stewart, on a charge of high treason

1628
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:55,400
so I won't have the pleasure of hanging you myself.

1629
01:40:57,267 --> 01:40:59,033
I can't deny it's a disappointment,

1630
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:02,800
but the law's the law.

1631
01:41:07,434 --> 01:41:10,634
- Alan, did you find the man?

1632
01:41:11,367 --> 01:41:12,200
- Aye, I did.

1633
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:15,000
It's too late now.

1634
01:41:16,733 --> 01:41:17,733
He's dead.

1635
01:41:21,467 --> 01:41:22,800
- Then all is lost?

1636
01:41:24,033 --> 01:41:24,833
(somber flute music)

1637
01:41:24,866 --> 01:41:25,700
They try me tomorrow.

1638
01:41:26,967 --> 01:41:29,000
A whole pack of Campbells just as you said.

1639
01:41:29,033 --> 01:41:30,900
- I should've forced you into the hills.

1640
01:41:30,933 --> 01:41:32,033
- I never would've run.

1641
01:41:32,067 --> 01:41:34,700
You'd have had no choice, not at the end of my dirk.

1642
01:41:39,766 --> 01:41:40,800
Dear God.

1643
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:45,967
You know, I don't know why

1644
01:41:48,766 --> 01:41:50,666
I always put such a value to your life

1645
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:58,766
and never my own.

1646
01:41:58,800 --> 01:41:59,800
Here on my own, old man.

1647
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:02,700
And, you're on your.

1648
01:42:11,833 --> 01:42:13,733
- I will not let him hang.

1649
01:42:13,766 --> 01:42:15,033
We must do something.

1650
01:42:15,067 --> 01:42:15,866
- What?

1651
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:17,100
Rouse the MacDonalds?

1652
01:42:17,133 --> 01:42:18,233
March on Fort William?

1653
01:42:18,267 --> 01:42:19,334
Michael. - Why not?

1654
01:42:20,766 --> 01:42:22,300
- You're talking nonsense, girl.

1655
01:42:22,334 --> 01:42:23,334
- I agree.

1656
01:42:23,367 --> 01:42:25,233
- Well, you're not a fighting man, Mr. Balfour,

1657
01:42:25,267 --> 01:42:26,700
you say so yourself.

1658
01:42:26,733 --> 01:42:29,800
- No, but I flatter myself that I have a brain.

1659
01:42:29,833 --> 01:42:31,067
Now, if we could get-- - Mr. Balfour--

1660
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:31,933
- Wheest!

1661
01:42:33,167 --> 01:42:36,866
If we can contrive to give Alan the means,

1662
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:38,866
I believe he can effect his own escape.

1663
01:42:39,733 --> 01:42:41,133
- That's true.

1664
01:42:41,167 --> 01:42:44,733
In the hands of such a man, a pistol or a dirk.

1665
01:42:44,766 --> 01:42:46,933
We'll it'd be as good as a key to him.

1666
01:42:46,967 --> 01:42:48,667
- But, how?

1667
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:50,334
- Are you known by sight to any at the prison?

1668
01:42:50,367 --> 01:42:51,267
- No.

1669
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:52,133
- Nor am I.

1670
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:55,700
Now, if we can stop quarreling for one minute

1671
01:42:56,467 --> 01:42:58,167
then perhaps we have a chance.

1672
01:43:00,167 --> 01:43:03,700
(horse hooves clomping)

1673
01:43:05,733 --> 01:43:06,733
- Thank you, no.

1674
01:43:07,933 --> 01:43:11,700
I have a question, Mr. Reid, to which I demand an answer.

1675
01:43:11,733 --> 01:43:12,700
The man you shot.

1676
01:43:14,833 --> 01:43:15,766
- In self defense.

1677
01:43:17,766 --> 01:43:20,067
- Was he the murderer of Campbell, the Red Fox?

1678
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:20,933
- He was.

1679
01:43:22,233 --> 01:43:23,766
- Did you pay him to do it?

1680
01:43:24,733 --> 01:43:26,033
- Naturally.

1681
01:43:26,067 --> 01:43:27,067
- (chuckles) Oh God.

1682
01:43:28,434 --> 01:43:31,000
And, this is the way you serve, King George.

1683
01:43:33,467 --> 01:43:34,300
- I serve the king as the king

1684
01:43:34,334 --> 01:43:37,766
would wish to be served, efficaciously.

1685
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:39,400
(footsteps clomping)

1686
01:43:39,434 --> 01:43:43,700
Forbes, you come of a good family,

1687
01:43:44,766 --> 01:43:47,866
but alas, not one endowed with much in the way of money.

1688
01:43:53,467 --> 01:43:55,400
- What do you mean, sir?

1689
01:43:55,434 --> 01:43:57,700
- Well, since you have not the means to purchase promotion

1690
01:43:57,733 --> 01:44:00,067
you must get it by your own merit

1691
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:02,766
and your superiors think very highly of your merit, Captain.

1692
01:44:03,933 --> 01:44:05,434
- My superiors?

1693
01:44:05,467 --> 01:44:07,033
- Well, you don't suppose I could've acted alone

1694
01:44:07,067 --> 01:44:07,900
in a matter so grave.

1695
01:44:07,933 --> 01:44:09,067
No, no, no, no.

1696
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:13,700
Men far greater than I, or you, gave it their sanction.

1697
01:44:13,733 --> 01:44:15,167
They think very highly of you.

1698
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,434
They have it in mind to give you a regiment.

1699
01:44:17,467 --> 01:44:18,400
Think of it.

1700
01:44:18,434 --> 01:44:20,334
A colonel at the age of 26.

1701
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:27,133
No, you see, Campbell of Glenure was not a sound man,

1702
01:44:27,167 --> 01:44:28,700
too soft on his own people.

1703
01:44:29,967 --> 01:44:31,733
I am a sound man.

1704
01:44:34,067 --> 01:44:37,733
And I believe you are too, a thoroughly sound man.

1705
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:42,866
(footsteps clomping)

1706
01:44:46,967 --> 01:44:47,967
- James of the Glen?

1707
01:44:49,067 --> 01:44:50,367
You are summoned to trial.

1708
01:44:52,967 --> 01:44:57,267
- Well, Alan, if they condemn me, as they're sure to do,

1709
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,733
they'll hang me straightaway.

1710
01:45:00,766 --> 01:45:03,334
(somber music)

1711
01:45:03,367 --> 01:45:04,200
- May we speak?

1712
01:45:15,233 --> 01:45:17,133
- I never knew you lost for words.

1713
01:45:20,267 --> 01:45:23,833
It's not the end, Alan, we'll carry on our quarrels

1714
01:45:23,866 --> 01:45:25,700
in a better place than this.

1715
01:45:25,733 --> 01:45:26,634
- [Man] It's time.

1716
01:45:29,967 --> 01:45:33,267
- [James] Trust in God, Alan, his mercy

1717
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:34,800
and his justice.

1718
01:45:41,334 --> 01:45:44,766
(keys clattering)

1719
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:47,267
(door clanking)

1720
01:45:58,733 --> 01:46:01,733
(chains clattering)

1721
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,200
- Well?

1722
01:46:15,233 --> 01:46:16,667
- It's no good.

1723
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:18,133
They've taken him from the prison.

1724
01:46:19,467 --> 01:46:23,667
- Let them be confounded and put to shame

1725
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:24,900
that seek after my soul.

1726
01:46:24,933 --> 01:46:26,400
(somber music)

1727
01:46:26,434 --> 01:46:30,233
Let them be as dust before the wind

1728
01:46:30,267 --> 01:46:31,900
for they have laid their net

1729
01:46:31,933 --> 01:46:35,634
to destroy me without cause.

1730
01:46:37,733 --> 01:46:39,367
False witnesses did rise up,

1731
01:46:40,967 --> 01:46:44,933
they laid to my charge, things I knew not.

1732
01:46:44,967 --> 01:46:45,866
(drumming music)

1733
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:49,900
Oh, deliver my soul from the calamities

1734
01:46:50,967 --> 01:46:54,700
which they did bring on me.

1735
01:46:54,733 --> 01:46:57,967
Judge me, oh Lord, my God,

1736
01:46:59,033 --> 01:46:59,700
(Margaret crying)

1737
01:46:59,733 --> 01:47:01,233
according to they righteousness.

1738
01:47:03,233 --> 01:47:06,933
- Man that is born of a woman has but a short time

1739
01:47:06,967 --> 01:47:08,733
to live and is full of misery.

1740
01:47:10,133 --> 01:47:10,967
He cometh up

1741
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,200
but is cut down slow. (crowd shouting)

1742
01:47:13,233 --> 01:47:18,233
he fleeth also as a shadow (drowned out by shouting crowd).

1743
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:22,233
(crowd applauding)

1744
01:47:35,133 --> 01:47:37,000
- I'm feeling rather hungry, Captain.

1745
01:47:38,133 --> 01:47:39,133
Care for some lunch?

1746
01:47:40,467 --> 01:47:42,833
- If you'll forgive me, I have other duties.

1747
01:47:42,866 --> 01:47:46,033
- [Soldier] About face, march.

1748
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,634
(dark music)

1749
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:57,933
(dramatic music) (punches thudding)

1750
01:47:57,967 --> 01:48:00,733
(men grunting)

1751
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:03,400
(bales clattering)

1752
01:48:03,434 --> 01:48:06,334
(women screaming)

1753
01:48:06,367 --> 01:48:09,667
(men shouting)

1754
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:12,700
(adventurous music)

1755
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,000
(horse hooves clomping) (coach clattering)

1756
01:48:35,766 --> 01:48:37,933
- Hurry up, we're not free of the Redcoats yet.

1757
01:48:50,467 --> 01:48:53,067
Well, the sooner you're in the Lowlands, the better for you

1758
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:54,267
and for me.

1759
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:55,200
- With the coach, we could bring them there in a few days.

1760
01:48:55,233 --> 01:48:57,100
- No, we've done enough, more than enough.

1761
01:48:57,133 --> 01:48:59,033
We go home and lie low, devilish low.

1762
01:49:00,467 --> 01:49:02,200
- Will you cross the Firth by the Bridge of Sterling?

1763
01:49:02,233 --> 01:49:04,400
- Aye, most likely.

1764
01:49:04,434 --> 01:49:06,400
Good luck, Mr. Stewart.

1765
01:49:06,434 --> 01:49:10,033
Mr. Balfour, I hope we may meet again some day.

1766
01:49:11,833 --> 01:49:12,700
- I hope so, too.

1767
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:22,634
(coach clattering)

1768
01:49:23,733 --> 01:49:25,200
- [Alan] Let's get you back to the Lowlands, Davie,

1769
01:49:25,233 --> 01:49:26,634
and your House of Shaws.

1770
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:36,000
(somber flute music)

1771
01:49:36,033 --> 01:49:39,800
It's a fine country, you don't think so, David?

1772
01:49:39,833 --> 01:49:40,967
- [David] It's a wilderness.

1773
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,766
- [Alan] (chuckles) You Lowlanders.

1774
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:48,067
You've plenty of brains, but you've no poetry to your souls.

1775
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:50,067
- [David] Well, from what I've seen of you Highlanders,

1776
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:53,334
you have a deal too much poetry and not enough brains.

1777
01:49:53,367 --> 01:49:55,866
(Alan laughs)

1778
01:50:01,434 --> 01:50:04,233
(water splashing)

1779
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:09,033
(fire crackling)

1780
01:50:13,334 --> 01:50:17,334
- It's really excellent, very good.

1781
01:50:18,766 --> 01:50:20,866
- So, were you courting a lassie when you left home?

1782
01:50:21,766 --> 01:50:22,667
- No.

1783
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:24,733
- No broken hearts left behind?

1784
01:50:24,766 --> 01:50:25,800
- No.

1785
01:50:26,766 --> 01:50:27,800
- Hmm.

1786
01:50:29,033 --> 01:50:31,766
- I suppose you have broken many hearts.

1787
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:33,167
- No.

1788
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:34,033
Only one.

1789
01:50:35,033 --> 01:50:36,267
She was everything to me.

1790
01:50:37,833 --> 01:50:38,766
But, I was married,

1791
01:50:42,334 --> 01:50:44,700
to that, my sword

1792
01:50:47,467 --> 01:50:48,300
and my king.

1793
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:52,634
- Alan, will you teach me to use a sword?

1794
01:50:53,434 --> 01:50:55,233
- Why?

1795
01:50:55,267 --> 01:50:56,400
- I just think it's uh,

1796
01:50:58,233 --> 01:50:59,866
a skill every man should acquire.

1797
01:51:01,434 --> 01:51:04,367
(bird squawking)

1798
01:51:09,733 --> 01:51:10,367
- En garde.

1799
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:13,033
Allez.

1800
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,833
(swords clanking)

1801
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:34,900
Not a great beginning.

1802
01:51:35,733 --> 01:51:38,300
(upbeat music)

1803
01:51:49,467 --> 01:51:52,766
Not bad, Davie, just don't hurt yourself.

1804
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:58,733
(David grunting)

1805
01:51:58,766 --> 01:52:01,400
(swords clacking)

1806
01:52:08,766 --> 01:52:09,800
Eh yah!

1807
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,733
(sword clanking)

1808
01:52:15,766 --> 01:52:17,167
- Well, you have more weapons than me.

1809
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:22,200
- Brains, Davie, brains (laughs).

1810
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:27,667
(birds chirping)

1811
01:52:28,833 --> 01:52:32,833
(David grunting) (rifle thudding)

1812
01:52:32,866 --> 01:52:33,700
- Ah no.

1813
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:36,200
(man laughing)

1814
01:52:36,233 --> 01:52:39,733
- Ian, get a grip on yourself, man.

1815
01:52:39,766 --> 01:52:41,700
Francis, look at you, God love you,

1816
01:52:41,733 --> 01:52:42,434
you're as fat as a cow.

1817
01:52:42,467 --> 01:52:45,700
(men laughing)

1818
01:52:45,733 --> 01:52:48,700
These are the sons of Cluny MacPherson, man.

1819
01:52:48,733 --> 01:52:50,100
We fought the English together.

1820
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,167
- He's wanted by the Crown.

1821
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,766
The Crown, the Parliament, and the Redcoats.

1822
01:52:55,434 --> 01:52:57,434
He's probably more hunted than I am myself.

1823
01:52:57,467 --> 01:52:59,367
- I thought they was in hiding in France.

1824
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:00,833
- Ah, not Cluny.

1825
01:53:00,866 --> 01:53:03,033
Lives like a fighting cock in his own country,

1826
01:53:03,067 --> 01:53:04,200
with his own people.

1827
01:53:04,233 --> 01:53:06,700
You'll have a taste of the real Highland life now, man.

1828
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:10,667
(upbeat music) (David grunts)

1829
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:11,634
What is it?

1830
01:53:12,766 --> 01:53:14,733
Ah, don't die on me now, Davie.

1831
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:19,434
Come along, you're a Lowlander, through and through.

1832
01:53:19,467 --> 01:53:20,267
No strength-- (David grunts)

1833
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:21,200
Whoop.

1834
01:53:21,233 --> 01:53:22,900
(laughs)

1835
01:53:22,933 --> 01:53:25,400
You're carrying the weight of the gold.

1836
01:53:25,434 --> 01:53:27,200
Come here, I'll carry you both.

1837
01:53:27,233 --> 01:53:29,300
(laughs)

1838
01:53:30,733 --> 01:53:33,167
You'll have a rest in Cluny's cave.

1839
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:33,866
Cluny!

1840
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:35,733
- Breck! - Lay out the cards,

1841
01:53:35,766 --> 01:53:37,233
you flat blackguard.

1842
01:53:37,267 --> 01:53:39,067
- Six, six, and seven.

1843
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:40,233
All right, right.

1844
01:53:40,267 --> 01:53:42,000
This time's up right.

1845
01:53:42,033 --> 01:53:44,933
This time I'll (mumbles).

1846
01:53:44,967 --> 01:53:46,167
Get ahold on you.

1847
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:47,000
I've seven.

1848
01:53:47,033 --> 01:53:48,334
It's only five.

1849
01:53:48,367 --> 01:53:49,167
- Jack!

1850
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,833
- No, no, it's a queen.

1851
01:53:50,866 --> 01:53:51,667
Jack then.

1852
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:52,733
- Queen.

1853
01:53:52,766 --> 01:53:53,400
- No Jack.

1854
01:53:53,434 --> 01:53:54,267
- [Alan] Jack.

1855
01:53:55,367 --> 01:53:58,634
- Seven, five, nine, Jack!

1856
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:14,100
(Cluny laughing)

1857
01:54:14,133 --> 01:54:16,400
Are you fleeced, Mr. Stewart?

1858
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:21,800
Have you more in your pocket or only stitches?

1859
01:54:25,434 --> 01:54:27,800
Or can you use this?

1860
01:54:29,434 --> 01:54:30,267
Eh?

1861
01:54:35,833 --> 01:54:40,833
(belt thudding) (ethereal music)

1862
01:54:45,133 --> 01:54:48,033
(chair clattering)

1863
01:54:52,866 --> 01:54:54,833
- [Alan] Davie, gimme a loan.

1864
01:54:54,866 --> 01:54:56,100
- [David] What?

1865
01:54:56,133 --> 01:54:56,967
- Money.

1866
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:15,400
Lay out the cards, Cluny.

1867
01:55:15,434 --> 01:55:18,933
(coins clattering)

1868
01:55:18,967 --> 01:55:22,267
(Cluny laughs)

1869
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:23,100
- [David] Did you win?

1870
01:55:23,133 --> 01:55:24,033
- [Alan] Did I win?

1871
01:55:24,067 --> 01:55:24,866
I lost.

1872
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:25,534
- [David] All of it?

1873
01:55:25,567 --> 01:55:26,733
- [Alan] Every penny of it.

1874
01:55:26,766 --> 01:55:27,667
- You lost it all?

1875
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:28,534
- Yours and mine. - I don't believe it.

1876
01:55:28,567 --> 01:55:31,334
(Alan laughs) That was my money, too.

1877
01:55:31,367 --> 01:55:33,833
You Highlanders, you're fools.

1878
01:55:33,866 --> 01:55:36,067
I can't tolerate your way of life any longer.

1879
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:37,400
- David, it's not the way.

1880
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,800
No way for two friends to take such a matter.

1881
01:55:40,833 --> 01:55:42,367
- Oh, and how should I take it?

1882
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:44,667
- David, I owe you my life.

1883
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:46,400
Now, I owe you some money.

1884
01:55:46,434 --> 01:55:49,100
A gentleman would try to make the burden light,

1885
01:55:49,133 --> 01:55:50,367
try to see the reason.

1886
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,000
- You stand there and tell me

1887
01:55:52,033 --> 01:55:53,667
how a gentleman should behave?

1888
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:56,400
- I think you've much to learn upon the subject, man.

1889
01:55:56,434 --> 01:56:00,434
- You gambled your Prince's gold at cards

1890
01:56:00,467 --> 01:56:03,133
and you stand there and preach to me

1891
01:56:03,167 --> 01:56:04,700
about what a gentleman should do?

1892
01:56:04,733 --> 01:56:05,733
- [Alan] What are you talking about?

1893
01:56:05,766 --> 01:56:07,233
I never risked a penny of it.

1894
01:56:07,267 --> 01:56:09,700
- Oh, I saw the money on the table.

1895
01:56:09,733 --> 01:56:12,334
- Never, ever suggest

1896
01:56:14,033 --> 01:56:17,700
that I betray my cause. (bagpipe music)

1897
01:56:22,434 --> 01:56:23,233
- Why not?

1898
01:56:23,933 --> 01:56:25,800
Your cause is lost, isn't it?

1899
01:56:27,434 --> 01:56:29,200
It's the past.

1900
01:56:31,367 --> 01:56:32,634
Scotland decided.

1901
01:56:33,733 --> 01:56:35,067
We chose King George.

1902
01:56:36,933 --> 01:56:38,667
Whose gonna rise up against us?

1903
01:56:42,733 --> 01:56:43,367
You?

1904
01:56:45,367 --> 01:56:46,200
You?

1905
01:56:51,700 --> 01:56:52,766
Your time is over.

1906
01:56:55,367 --> 01:57:00,700
You Stewarts, you lost the throne through your own follies

1907
01:57:00,733 --> 01:57:02,900
and vices and you know it.

1908
01:57:05,733 --> 01:57:10,033
As for your Bonny Prince Charlie, what did he do?

1909
01:57:10,067 --> 01:57:12,000
What did he really do?

1910
01:57:12,033 --> 01:57:16,434
He brought ruin and destruction and civil war

1911
01:57:16,467 --> 01:57:17,667
to the Highlands.

1912
01:57:20,434 --> 01:57:23,367
And, he wasn't even Scottish.

1913
01:57:24,967 --> 01:57:28,700
Your cause is lost and you know it.

1914
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:35,967
(somber music)

1915
01:57:48,467 --> 01:57:51,067
(cow mooing)

1916
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:57,733
(horse hooves clomping)

1917
01:58:04,434 --> 01:58:06,933
- They're over there just beyond the hill.

1918
01:58:08,434 --> 01:58:09,866
- Wait here.

1919
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:12,667
(men chattering)

1920
01:58:15,967 --> 01:58:17,733
Captain, they've been sighted.

1921
01:58:18,467 --> 01:58:19,400
- Where?

1922
01:58:19,434 --> 01:58:20,933
- [Soldier] About two miles to the north.

1923
01:58:21,933 --> 01:58:22,800
- Sergeant.

1924
01:58:22,833 --> 01:58:23,667
- [Sergeant] Sir!

1925
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:26,434
- Fall in the men.

1926
01:58:26,467 --> 01:58:27,667
- Sir.

1927
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:29,967
Stand to, men, stand to.

1928
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,334
(men chattering) (horse whinnying)

1929
01:58:32,367 --> 01:58:34,167
First company withdraw your pickets.

1930
01:58:35,033 --> 01:58:38,700
- There we are, Captain, patience and perseverance.

1931
01:58:38,733 --> 01:58:40,367
- [Sergeant] Quick about it now.

1932
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:41,400
Have a shot ready.

1933
01:58:41,434 --> 01:58:44,300
(ominous music)

1934
01:58:50,766 --> 01:58:53,334
(birds chirping)

1935
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:05,967
(moving to dramatic music)

1936
01:59:29,067 --> 01:59:31,733
(David panting)

1937
01:59:33,833 --> 01:59:36,700
(ominous music)

1938
01:59:47,334 --> 01:59:48,634
- I think they caught us now.

1939
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:54,700
(moving to dramatic music)

1940
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:04,233
(coach clattering)

1941
02:00:04,267 --> 02:00:05,700
- [David] Alan.

1942
02:00:06,733 --> 02:00:07,866
It's MacDonald's coach.

1943
02:00:17,334 --> 02:00:18,133
- Get in.

1944
02:00:22,167 --> 02:00:23,634
Well, stay down on the floor.

1945
02:00:30,833 --> 02:00:31,667
- Stand to, men.

1946
02:00:34,733 --> 02:00:35,733
Whoa.

1947
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:43,233
- I'm Mary MacDonald of Dunbrae.

1948
02:00:43,267 --> 02:00:45,733
My grandfather the Earl is gravely ill.

1949
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:48,300
- My apologies, ma'am.

1950
02:00:52,733 --> 02:00:53,367
Let them pass.

1951
02:01:02,133 --> 02:01:04,400
- You old goat, your timing's impeccable.

1952
02:01:04,434 --> 02:01:05,967
- It's Mary you have to thank.

1953
02:01:06,933 --> 02:01:08,634
I said it could cost us our necks.

1954
02:01:09,733 --> 02:01:11,434
I said Alan Breck needed no aid from us,

1955
02:01:11,467 --> 02:01:12,900
but she wouldn't have it.

1956
02:01:12,933 --> 02:01:13,766
- Grandfather.

1957
02:01:15,167 --> 02:01:18,400
- Mr. Balfour's health, it seems is her great concern.

1958
02:01:24,733 --> 02:01:27,233
- So, you just happened to be on the road.

1959
02:01:27,267 --> 02:01:28,300
- We were fairly certain that you'd make

1960
02:01:28,334 --> 02:01:31,967
for the Bridge of Sterling, so we took a lodging

1961
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,067
in the inn and waited.

1962
02:01:33,100 --> 02:01:35,766
- It isn't only the Redcoats that have their spies.

1963
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:47,133
(coach clattering)

1964
02:01:50,067 --> 02:01:50,900
- Halt!

1965
02:01:58,300 --> 02:01:59,167
- What the devil are you at?

1966
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:00,033
Let me pass.

1967
02:02:07,700 --> 02:02:09,267
Curse it, do you know who I am?

1968
02:02:13,367 --> 02:02:14,634
I am the Earl of Dunbrae.

1969
02:02:17,733 --> 02:02:19,300
(cane thudding)

1970
02:02:19,334 --> 02:02:22,233
(coach clattering)

1971
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:27,033
- We're almost safe, Grandfather.

1972
02:02:52,766 --> 02:02:54,634
Gentlemen, we're in the Lowland.

1973
02:02:55,334 --> 02:02:58,067
(both grunting)

1974
02:02:58,100 --> 02:03:00,701
- [Alan] We made it, Davie.

1975
02:03:00,733 --> 02:03:01,634
We made it.

1976
02:03:05,067 --> 02:03:07,766
(Mary laughs)

1977
02:03:12,233 --> 02:03:14,766
(all laugh)

1978
02:03:24,733 --> 02:03:26,933
- The Earl passed by several hours ago.

1979
02:03:29,701 --> 02:03:32,400
I swear there were no others, only the old man

1980
02:03:32,434 --> 02:03:33,567
and his granddaughter.

1981
02:03:33,601 --> 02:03:36,033
- Cross the bridge, Captain and continue the pursuit.

1982
02:03:36,067 --> 02:03:37,667
Send me word when they're found.

1983
02:03:39,167 --> 02:03:40,766
- You want me to pursue them on my own?

1984
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,933
- I have no authority beyond this point

1985
02:03:42,967 --> 02:03:44,167
but they're mine to hang.

1986
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:45,933
Bring them to me, Captain.

1987
02:03:45,967 --> 02:03:46,900
- [Captain] Sir.

1988
02:03:46,933 --> 02:03:48,300
- Do you want promotion?

1989
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:52,634
Get on with it.

1990
02:03:58,733 --> 02:04:01,067
- Go and catch a falling star. (gentle music)

1991
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:02,900
Get with child a mandrake root.

1992
02:04:03,766 --> 02:04:06,300
Tell me where all past years are

1993
02:04:06,334 --> 02:04:09,167
or who cleft the devil's foot.

1994
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:11,667
Teach me to hear mermaids singing

1995
02:04:11,701 --> 02:04:14,200
or to keep off envy's stinging

1996
02:04:14,233 --> 02:04:15,434
and find what wind--

1997
02:04:15,467 --> 02:04:20,701
- Miss MacDonald, uh, I wanted to,

1998
02:04:20,733 --> 02:04:22,733
I wanted to thank you for coming to our aid.

1999
02:04:24,701 --> 02:04:27,667
And, I wanted to apologize to you.

2000
02:04:27,701 --> 02:04:29,667
I believe I called you a savage.

2001
02:04:29,701 --> 02:04:31,167
- There's no need to apologize.

2002
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:34,267
- Well, I take it back unreservedly.

2003
02:04:36,100 --> 02:04:39,667
- (chuckles) Forgive me, Mr. Balfour,

2004
02:04:39,701 --> 02:04:40,833
but you're so serious.

2005
02:04:44,167 --> 02:04:46,766
- I go this morning to learn my fate

2006
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:47,933
from the lawyer Rankeillor.

2007
02:04:49,434 --> 02:04:52,733
- You come back and tell me how it turns out?

2008
02:04:52,766 --> 02:04:53,800
And if you got your estate back?

2009
02:04:53,833 --> 02:04:55,334
- I would like that very much.

2010
02:04:57,067 --> 02:04:57,733
(patrons chattering)

2011
02:04:57,766 --> 02:05:00,701
- So, you're bound for France.

2012
02:05:01,701 --> 02:05:02,334
- Aye.

2013
02:05:06,833 --> 02:05:09,766
(pouch jangling)

2014
02:05:10,701 --> 02:05:13,933
- Well, take that with you when you go.

2015
02:05:19,733 --> 02:05:20,400
(bagpipe music)

2016
02:05:20,434 --> 02:05:21,933
Well, don't gawk, man, take it.

2017
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:28,267
And, you can tell His Majesty he's still has loyal friends

2018
02:05:28,300 --> 02:05:30,133
among the MacDonalds of Dunrae.

2019
02:05:33,033 --> 02:05:35,133
- Will you shake the hand of an Appin Stewart?

2020
02:05:51,701 --> 02:05:55,033
(horse hooves clomping)

2021
02:06:02,701 --> 02:06:05,933
(pedestrians chattering)

2022
02:06:21,133 --> 02:06:24,067
- Would you have a dram, Captain Forbes?

2023
02:06:26,300 --> 02:06:27,733
- What would we drink to?

2024
02:06:28,766 --> 02:06:33,100
- The future and the demise of Mr. William Reid.

2025
02:06:36,933 --> 02:06:38,167
(loud knocking)

2026
02:06:38,200 --> 02:06:40,933
(birds chirping)

2027
02:06:44,434 --> 02:06:46,167
- [David] I'm here to see Mr. Rankeillor.

2028
02:06:51,334 --> 02:06:53,400
- There is no great mystery, Mr. Balfour,

2029
02:06:54,267 --> 02:06:55,833
and there was no great wrong

2030
02:06:57,334 --> 02:07:00,200
until your uncle's wicked attempt at kidnap,

2031
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:02,167
at which I still shudder.

2032
02:07:05,766 --> 02:07:08,800
Your father, Alexander Balfour and his brother Ebenezer

2033
02:07:09,766 --> 02:07:13,701
both fell in love with the same lady, a Miss Pitarrow.

2034
02:07:14,866 --> 02:07:16,334
- My mother?

2035
02:07:16,367 --> 02:07:18,367
- Aye, your mother.

2036
02:07:21,766 --> 02:07:23,667
The estate of Shaws is entailed.

2037
02:07:24,467 --> 02:07:26,100
Do you know what that means?

2038
02:07:27,167 --> 02:07:28,000
- Uh, no, sir.

2039
02:07:28,866 --> 02:07:31,400
- It means that it can never be sold,

2040
02:07:31,434 --> 02:07:34,900
but must be passed on entire from generation to generation.

2041
02:07:37,033 --> 02:07:41,766
Now, your father was the first born son.

2042
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:42,800
- Ah, I discovered that.

2043
02:07:44,067 --> 02:07:45,900
- He, therefore, inherited Shaws.

2044
02:07:46,733 --> 02:07:49,733
Your Uncle Ebenezer had nothing except

2045
02:07:49,766 --> 02:07:52,167
the misguided affection of Miss Pitarrow

2046
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:54,300
which he used to force a bargain.

2047
02:07:56,033 --> 02:07:58,667
Your father, to make over his rents,

2048
02:07:58,701 --> 02:08:00,900
your uncle to give up the lady.

2049
02:08:01,933 --> 02:08:03,334
- My father gave away all his rent

2050
02:08:03,367 --> 02:08:05,200
for the love of my mother?

2051
02:08:05,233 --> 02:08:08,800
- Aye, he did, but only for his lifetime.

2052
02:08:11,267 --> 02:08:14,167
The day that he died, you became the legal owner of Shaws.

2053
02:08:15,133 --> 02:08:16,033
You are the owner.

2054
02:08:18,833 --> 02:08:21,434
Small wonder that Ebenezer wanted you dead.

2055
02:08:21,467 --> 02:08:24,334
(clock ticking)

2056
02:08:28,467 --> 02:08:31,766
(somber flute music)

2057
02:08:32,833 --> 02:08:35,701
(loud knocking)

2058
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:38,167
- Well, that's a civil welcome, indeed.

2059
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:40,833
- One step nearer you're a dead man, Mr. Highlander.

2060
02:08:40,866 --> 02:08:42,733
- And a civil speech to go with it, let it go.

2061
02:08:42,766 --> 02:08:44,701
I just come for business.

2062
02:08:44,733 --> 02:08:45,701
As I said.

2063
02:08:45,733 --> 02:08:47,033
- You did not say what.

2064
02:08:50,733 --> 02:08:52,967
- There's been a lad who was cast up

2065
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,701
on the shores of Ardnamurchan.

2066
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:56,866
- [Ebenezer] Alive?

2067
02:08:56,900 --> 02:08:58,733
- Most certainly alive, sir.

2068
02:08:59,733 --> 02:09:00,766
David Balfour.

2069
02:09:02,933 --> 02:09:05,067
Tedious long business to nurse the boy

2070
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:07,967
back to health.

2071
02:09:08,967 --> 02:09:09,933
'Twas a great expense.

2072
02:09:09,967 --> 02:09:12,434
- Aye, no doubt, just say on, Mr. Highlander.

2073
02:09:12,467 --> 02:09:14,900
- Well sir, a man's a fool to be spending his money

2074
02:09:14,933 --> 02:09:17,033
in that way, uh (chuckles).

2075
02:09:17,067 --> 02:09:18,900
Without giving a thought to a return,

2076
02:09:20,467 --> 02:09:22,000
a wee return (chuckles).

2077
02:09:24,067 --> 02:09:25,067
- Well, that's true.

2078
02:09:26,067 --> 02:09:29,701
Well, we agree together there, Mr. Highlander.

2079
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:33,200
- It just come to my mind you might pay a wee bit more

2080
02:09:33,233 --> 02:09:34,100
to have him dead.

2081
02:09:36,167 --> 02:09:38,933
- Just what put that into your mind?

2082
02:09:41,067 --> 02:09:43,667
- Well, there was something he let slip, sir,

2083
02:09:43,701 --> 02:09:45,000
when the fever was on him.

2084
02:09:46,933 --> 02:09:50,900
You did have him kidnapped aboard a brig,

2085
02:09:53,467 --> 02:09:54,701
for 60 guineas.

2086
02:09:58,434 --> 02:10:00,067
- 60 guineas?

2087
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:00,933
- Aye.

2088
02:10:01,900 --> 02:10:04,733
(Ebenezer laughs)

2089
02:10:05,701 --> 02:10:06,800
- Did he say that?

2090
02:10:07,967 --> 02:10:09,866
I never paid a penny piece, man.

2091
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:11,033
I didn't have to.

2092
02:10:11,067 --> 02:10:13,000
They took him for the price of his hide

2093
02:10:13,033 --> 02:10:14,033
at slave auction.

2094
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:18,100
(laugh) Kidnap cost me nothing.

2095
02:10:18,133 --> 02:10:20,766
(Alan laughs)

2096
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:21,634
Not a copper coin.

2097
02:10:21,667 --> 02:10:23,634
- That was served excellently well.

2098
02:10:25,367 --> 02:10:26,667
Good day, Mr. Balfour.

2099
02:10:27,967 --> 02:10:29,367
May I present Mr. Crawford.

2100
02:10:30,766 --> 02:10:31,434
(Alan laughing)

2101
02:10:31,467 --> 02:10:32,367
He's a magistrate.

2102
02:10:33,701 --> 02:10:37,033
He heard every word and will witness to it.

2103
02:10:37,067 --> 02:10:38,833
(door clattering)

2104
02:10:38,866 --> 02:10:39,967
There is another door.

2105
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,367
I have the key.

2106
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:45,334
(coins clattering)

2107
02:10:51,233 --> 02:10:54,334
Mr. Balfour, take your hands off that money, sir.

2108
02:10:54,367 --> 02:10:55,400
It is not yours.

2109
02:10:55,434 --> 02:10:57,334
- He could take my rents, he can't take my gold,

2110
02:10:57,367 --> 02:10:58,667
not the gold I've saved.

2111
02:10:58,701 --> 02:11:00,200
- That's not what the law says.

2112
02:11:00,233 --> 02:11:01,667
- He can't take my gold.

2113
02:11:01,701 --> 02:11:03,733
- The law in this case states that any monies

2114
02:11:03,766 --> 02:11:05,933
derived from the estate which are unspent

2115
02:11:05,967 --> 02:11:07,866
remain the property of the estate.

2116
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:10,334
- No, it's a lie, it's a damnable lie.

2117
02:11:10,367 --> 02:11:13,667
- In short, sir, every penny you've scrimped and hoarded

2118
02:11:13,701 --> 02:11:15,100
through your miserable life

2119
02:11:16,067 --> 02:11:18,667
belongs to your nephew, David Balfour.

2120
02:11:19,866 --> 02:11:22,800
(Ebenezer cries)

2121
02:11:23,833 --> 02:11:25,634
Poor, miserable wretch.

2122
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:35,733
(horse hooves clomping)

2123
02:11:51,233 --> 02:11:53,833
- There's a boat waiting nearby to take him to France.

2124
02:11:53,866 --> 02:11:56,167
With your permission, we must proceed on foot.

2125
02:11:57,434 --> 02:11:58,634
- Form columns.

2126
02:11:59,334 --> 02:12:00,434
- [Soldier] Forming columns.

2127
02:12:00,467 --> 02:12:01,800
- [Soldier] Forward.

2128
02:12:01,833 --> 02:12:02,967
- [Soldier] Double forward.

2129
02:12:15,733 --> 02:12:16,967
- I suggest you wait here

2130
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:18,800
until I've got my men into position.

2131
02:12:21,167 --> 02:12:23,667
- Trust there'll be no more mistakes, Captain.

2132
02:12:24,434 --> 02:12:26,300
- You can be sure of that, Mr. Reid.

2133
02:12:28,367 --> 02:12:31,701
(horse hooves clomping)

2134
02:12:38,467 --> 02:12:41,400
(birds chirping)

2135
02:12:44,334 --> 02:12:45,667
- Prepare to left wheel.

2136
02:12:46,733 --> 02:12:47,434
- Forgive me sir, but this isn't the way

2137
02:12:47,467 --> 02:12:48,900
to the coast, surely.

2138
02:12:48,933 --> 02:12:50,400
- I'm not going to the coast, Lieutenant.

2139
02:12:50,434 --> 02:12:52,434
We're going back to the barracks at Cramond.

2140
02:12:52,467 --> 02:12:53,701
- But, sir, I thought--

2141
02:12:53,733 --> 02:12:54,933
- That was Mr. Reid's order.

2142
02:12:56,233 --> 02:12:57,233
Do you question it?

2143
02:12:57,267 --> 02:12:58,100
- No, sir, of course not.

2144
02:12:58,133 --> 02:12:59,267
- Very wise.

2145
02:12:59,300 --> 02:13:01,167
He's not a man to cross.

2146
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:02,400
Carry on, Lieutenant.

2147
02:13:02,434 --> 02:13:03,667
Come on!

2148
02:13:03,701 --> 02:13:04,400
Go on!

2149
02:13:04,434 --> 02:13:06,866
(horse hooves clomping)

2150
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:10,000
(ominous music)

2151
02:13:10,033 --> 02:13:10,933
- [Alan] Mr. Reid.

2152
02:13:23,766 --> 02:13:26,701
(sword clattering)

2153
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:33,766
- You're mistaking me for a gentleman, Mr. Stewart.

2154
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:36,067
I've no intention of fighting you.

2155
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:37,866
You'll have to kill an unarmed man.

2156
02:13:40,701 --> 02:13:42,000
And, I wonder which is the greater?

2157
02:13:42,033 --> 02:13:44,701
Your sense of honor

2158
02:13:46,733 --> 02:13:48,000
or your hatred of me.

2159
02:13:52,133 --> 02:13:53,800
Good day to you, Mr. Stewart.

2160
02:13:58,400 --> 02:13:59,701
(pistol clacking)

2161
02:13:59,733 --> 02:14:02,200
(pistol firing)

2162
02:14:06,467 --> 02:14:07,701
- Drive on.

2163
02:14:07,733 --> 02:14:09,300
- [Driver] Ho, hey!

2164
02:14:12,067 --> 02:14:13,000
Ha, ha, ha!

2165
02:14:18,367 --> 02:14:19,200
Ha!

2166
02:14:20,701 --> 02:14:23,267
(dramatic music)

2167
02:14:29,733 --> 02:14:31,933
(horse hooves clomping) (coach clattering)

2168
02:14:31,967 --> 02:14:34,634
(whip thudding)

2169
02:14:59,866 --> 02:15:02,400
(driver grunting)

2170
02:15:02,434 --> 02:15:05,667
(driver shouting)

2171
02:15:06,367 --> 02:15:09,933
(whip thudding) - Yah, yah.

2172
02:15:11,267 --> 02:15:12,100
Yah.

2173
02:15:25,766 --> 02:15:29,233
(moving to adventure music)

2174
02:15:30,267 --> 02:15:33,200
(whip thudding)

2175
02:15:33,233 --> 02:15:34,067
Yah, yah!

2176
02:15:35,900 --> 02:15:36,900
- Slow down!

2177
02:15:46,833 --> 02:15:47,900
- [Alan] Yah!

2178
02:15:54,434 --> 02:15:55,667
Yah!

2179
02:16:17,267 --> 02:16:18,100
- You...

2180
02:16:19,067 --> 02:16:21,833
(coach rumbling)

2181
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:39,833
No!

2182
02:16:40,933 --> 02:16:43,833
(coach clattering)

2183
02:16:46,434 --> 02:16:49,267
(water splashing)

2184
02:16:56,334 --> 02:16:59,167
(birds squawking)

2185
02:17:04,267 --> 02:17:07,100
(waves splashing)

2186
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:15,000
- Here's a parting gift for you, Davie.

2187
02:17:16,967 --> 02:17:18,400
I can't take your sword, Alan. - Take it.

2188
02:17:18,434 --> 02:17:19,833
I got no use for it now.

2189
02:17:20,933 --> 02:17:22,967
You hang it on the wall in your great house.

2190
02:17:29,733 --> 02:17:31,667
No doubt you'll be having sons now.

2191
02:17:37,434 --> 02:17:39,033
You could tell 'em it came from kings.

2192
02:17:50,866 --> 02:17:53,100
You've acquired some poetry to your soul now.

2193
02:17:54,766 --> 02:17:58,800
(gentle orchestral music)

2194
02:17:58,833 --> 02:18:00,733
Hey!

2195
02:18:01,434 --> 02:18:02,400
On my way now.

2196
02:18:02,434 --> 02:18:03,800
- [Man] Right.

2197
02:18:06,167 --> 02:18:07,000
Oh.

2198
02:18:10,233 --> 02:18:15,233
- [Alan] All right.

2199
02:18:25,434 --> 02:18:27,733
- [Narrator] Alan Breck Stewart and David Balfour

2200
02:18:27,766 --> 02:18:28,800
never met again.

2201
02:18:29,766 --> 02:18:31,434
Alan went on to have a distinguished career

2202
02:18:31,467 --> 02:18:32,766
in the French Army.

2203
02:18:33,434 --> 02:18:35,933
He died in Paris at the age of 65.

2204
02:18:37,434 --> 02:18:40,100
David Balfour married Mary MacDonald.

2205
02:18:40,133 --> 02:18:43,367
And, Alan was right, they did have sons.

2206
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:45,634
They were neither Highlander nor Lowlander.

2207
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:47,733
They were Scots.

2208
02:18:51,833 --> 02:18:54,400
(lively music)
