1
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:11,372
Got me feeling something new

2
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:15,333
before the last 24th

3
00:00:15,363 --> 00:00:19,076
way over summer June

4
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:23,863
up the tree oh with my family

5
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:26,866
like a silver-screen do

6
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:30,739
that we make brand-new

7
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:34,925
the only time of year

8
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:40,140
Thought we can take a break,
Charlie.

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,316
We've already missed
second breakfast. I'm cold.

10
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:45,928
Really?
I think this is invigorating.

11
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:50,411
the only time of year

12
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:53,727
- Hi!

13
00:00:55,577 --> 00:00:57,121
Okay, okay, okay...

14
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:01,161
Ah. Good morning, girls.

15
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:03,903
You're looking fine today.

16
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,427
Coming, bub. Ah.

17
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:08,690
Hi.

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,606
but we're not breaking

19
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:16,350
Hey, Betty, make
room for your sister, please.

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,006
list that hasn't come true

21
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:24,054
I got everything oh with my

22
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,665
Well, we're still 300 feet away.

23
00:01:26,695 --> 00:01:29,189
No, I think we found her.

24
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,626
-

25
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:35,326
the only time of year

26
00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:39,511
What is all that noise?

27
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,250
Listen.

28
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,609
-

29
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,568
I-I don't hear anything.

30
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:03,180
The tree, it's calling to us.

31
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,365
Um, I'm just gonna
take your word on that one.

32
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:20,022
This isn't the tree we ID'd
from the chopper.

33
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:23,730
I know. This one is way better.

34
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:30,432
Are we on private property?

35
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,827
Now we want all of our packages
to feel like they were wrapped

36
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:43,742
for a member of our own family.

37
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:46,745
All of our customers should feel
like Santa wrapped them himself.

38
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,921
Now, as I've just shown you,

39
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:51,880
I have my classic Christmas bow
that I put on every package,

40
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,274
but I encourage you all
to find your own unique style.

41
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:56,407
Okay, let's give it a try.

42
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:59,149
-Oh, that's gorgeous.
-

43
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,673
You just pull it.
-Yeah, nice.

44
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:04,850
It's all in the wrist.
Think Edward Scissorhands.

45
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,721
Yeah, you're getting it.

46
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:09,681
Okay, remember, joy delivered,
that's our motto.

47
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:11,204
Hi, honey, I hate to interrupt,

48
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,467
but the new ornaments
just came in.

49
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:16,078
Oh. These are fantastic!

50
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:18,385
Dad, the craftsmanship
is amazing!

51
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:20,039
Where do you find these?

52
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:22,302
These were hand-painted
by a grad student

53
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:25,305
I met at a craft fair down in
Boston. Aren't they beautiful?

54
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:28,613
-Pick out your favorite one.
-Ooh. Um...

55
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:30,876
-This one for sure.
-Oh.

56
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:32,965
-Partridge.
-Yeah.

57
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:35,881
These will be perfect
for next year's line, dad.

58
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:38,449
Yeah, perfect for your
first catalog on your own.

59
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,061
Mm. Can't believe you and mom
are retiring in January.

60
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:43,628
Going to miss you.

61
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:45,412
Hey, you'll be too busy
to miss us. Come on.

62
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:48,067
I know, there's so much to do
around here.

63
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:50,200
CEO, HR, buyer...

64
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,289
Butcher, baker,
candlestick maker.

65
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,203
-Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha...
-

66
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,603
Oh.

67
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:58,164
Mm. I got to go.
Marie's outside.

68
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:00,384
-She needs me for a taste test.
-Yeah. Say hi.

69
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:03,612
-Saving this one for you.
-Thank you!

70
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,174
The tree
is gorgeous, Charlotte.

71
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:10,089
I'm looking at the photos
right now.

72
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,395
The governor is gonna be
over the moon.

73
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:13,048
You tell him
that it is three feet taller

74
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:14,267
than Vermont state
Christmas tree.

75
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:16,138
How soon can you get it
to Augusta?

76
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:17,531
We're working on it.

77
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:19,141
There's no room
for error on this one.

78
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:21,274
-We're counting on you.
-I know. I know.

79
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:23,233
Good, because I wanna get
a press release out

80
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,756
as soon as it's under contract.

81
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:26,591
Okay. Bye.

82
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:30,073
Nice!

83
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,332
-Uh-huh? Uh-huh?
-Oh...

84
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:38,465
I think I just died and went
to heaven. What is that?

85
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:40,946
An experiment,
a Christmas macaron

86
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:43,340
with cranberry filling
and rosemary essence.

87
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,864
Amazing! For the employee
Christmas party?

88
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:47,996
Yeah, I only had to make four
dozen to find the perfect one.

89
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:51,747
Save the rejects
for my dad, you'll make his day.

90
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:57,136
-So it was a drone.
-What?

91
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,833
This morning,
all the-the buzzing.

92
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:00,139
What are you talking about?

93
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:03,498
Uh, uh, excuse me? Hi!

94
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:13,326
Hi, uh, I'd like to talk to you
just for a second about, uh,

95
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:17,069
the, uh, uh, uh...

96
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:19,376
-Your, um...

97
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:22,944
The, um, uh, the drone!

98
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:24,990
Oh, sorry if we caused
any trouble.

99
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,175
No! No, no, no, no. No. No.

100
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:31,257
I mean, yes.

101
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:36,131
Just the, the buzzing,
it got my chickens all riled up.

102
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:39,787
I'm really sorry about that.
Look, we're almost done here.

103
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:42,616
-I like your antlers.
-Oh.

104
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:44,974
'Tis the season and all.

105
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:48,666
You two look like
you're from around here.

106
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:49,667
Can you make a recommendation
for lunch?

107
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:51,190
Uh, what about that place

108
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,496
I was telling you about,
Charlie?

109
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:53,497
No,
something heartier.

110
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:56,282
Like, stick-to-your-ribs food.

111
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:58,066
Isn't Camden famous for stew?

112
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:00,112
-Uh, stew?
-Stew?

113
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:02,506
-No.
-Maybe a 100 years ago.

114
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:05,030
It's like the best patisserie
in New England.

115
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,206
-In Camden?
- Hey.

116
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:08,555
It's not like
we're some backwards town.

117
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,427
-No, that's not what I--
-We have a library.

118
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:13,734
We got a newspaper, even Wi-Fi.

119
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:16,389
Can we please
just get some lunch? I...

120
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,348
If I don't eat something, I'm...

121
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,046
You are looking
for Noelle's Patisserie.

122
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:24,528
-Wait a minute, you're...
-Oh.

123
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:28,445
-Marie Gauthier! Oh!
-That I am.

124
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,795
I have been following you
since Paris.

125
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:33,580
Well, I just made
a Gateau St. Honore.

126
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,671
Mm! I hear your pate a choux
is amazing.

127
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:40,065
You mean pate a choux.

128
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:41,806
But it took me forever
to figure that out.

129
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,460
Okay, no more compliments.

130
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,287
She'll be impossible
for the rest of the day.

131
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,289
Come on, I'll take you over.
Why don't you join us?

132
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,075
-I can't. I gotta work.
-Oh, come on.

133
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:53,295
I owe you a cup of coffee
for all the trouble.

134
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:55,218
Or a baguette
for the chickens.

135
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,953
Another time. Thank you.

136
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:01,050
Mm-hmm. Hm.

137
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:11,104
Oh, my!

138
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,889
Ooh...

139
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:23,151
There you are.
Oh, my two favorite people.

140
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:26,677
Uh-oh, that's code for I have
something I need you to do.

141
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,940
This consultant's latest report
has come in

142
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,508
and there's a few things
we need to go over.

143
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:34,772
Oh, come on, I didn't think
we needed to reinvent the wheel.

144
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:36,295
I thought we'd been doing
a pretty good job

145
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:37,557
running the company
for the past 100 years.

146
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:39,516
We just wanna
make this transition

147
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:41,169
as smooth as possible for you,
darling.

148
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,650
It's okay, mom. We agreed we
needed a strategic plan.

149
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,660
Good, good, good.

150
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,659
Uh, why are they questioning
our complimentary gift-wrapping?

151
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:56,054
-That's who we are.
-What? I don't think...

152
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:59,013
I think they just mentioned

153
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:01,929
that we should get an automated
gift-wrapping machine,

154
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:06,281
which seems like an idea

155
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:08,153
that, you know,
we could look at.

156
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:09,894
You know, what I find
really interesting is

157
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:12,157
they want us to have
more of a digital footprint

158
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:14,507
for our catalog.

159
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:16,814
But the, the catalog
is what makes us unique.

160
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:20,252
We're more than just
another online retailer.

161
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:24,038
Listen, if we're gonna reject
all of their recommendations,

162
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:26,388
that's not gonna leave us
many options.

163
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:30,392
Okay, okay, let's, uh,
let's all take a beat

164
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:33,439
and, uh, we'll come back
and read it more thoroughly.

165
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:36,050
We don't... We just...

166
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,922
Marcus, it's gonna be
the end of January before--

167
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,490
Honey, we will, we will
get to the report, I promise,

168
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,448
but right now we have
those Christmas stockings

169
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:43,493
for the first responders...

170
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,233
I pulled some stock already.

171
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:47,932
Uh, self-care items they
wouldn't only buy for themselves

172
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:49,411
chocolates, candles,
that sort of thing.

173
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:52,066
See? Perfect.
She knows what she's doing.

174
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:54,373
Okay, well, let's read
the report, then we'll talk.

175
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:55,947
-Okay.
-Mm.

176
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:09,396
Dad says he can't wait
to try the macarons.

177
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,305
-They're still here?
-They set up shop...

178
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:15,481
Like, it's their office
and they keep ordering food.

179
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:17,230
How much can they eat?

180
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:20,834
Hi. Can we have another round?

181
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:23,620
And, yeah, we're starving. We've
been in the field since dawn.

182
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,447
We haven't formally met.
I'm Charlotte Freeman.

183
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:27,145
-Alma.
-Everybody calls me Charlie.

184
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:29,408
Or Drone Lady.

185
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:32,193
That, too, but I prefer Charlie.

186
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:34,195
This is Rohan,
my partner in crime.

187
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,457
Hey.

188
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,503
-Oh. For your papa.
-Ah!

189
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,723
You two seem to know
each other pretty well.

190
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,682
Uh, my first job out of
grad school was in Paris, Marie

191
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:44,989
worked at the little place where
I got my coffee every morning.

192
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,252
It was so nice to have
a fellow American come in.

193
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:49,689
I became obsessed
with her eclairs.

194
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:52,126
-We got to be good friends.
-Mm. Paris is my favorite city.

195
00:09:52,156 --> 00:09:55,608
-The food, the clothes.
-Yeah, I have relatives there.

196
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,828
I actually apprenticed
in their patisserie.

197
00:09:57,858 --> 00:09:59,438
When we met, she'd already
been there for ten years.

198
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,266
I learned to bake
from my Grandmother Noelle.

199
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:04,356
My recipes are hers,
except, with a twist.

200
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:06,488
I made the sourdough starter
you posted.

201
00:10:06,518 --> 00:10:08,403
Yeah, he carries it around
in a jar everywhere we go.

202
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,928
-Yes, I have to feed it.
-It's like having a baby.

203
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,233
-He named it.
-Of course I named it.

204
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:14,409
What do you call it?

205
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:15,759
-Puff Daddy.
- Puff Daddy!

206
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:18,631
You just earned
a free pain au chocolat.

207
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:21,982
Ooh. Thank you.

208
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:24,332
I don't get
how youended up in Camden.

209
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:26,421
I grew up here, actually.

210
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:29,033
When it was time to come home,
I made Marie come with me.

211
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,948
We always talked about
going into business together.

212
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:32,471
We wanted to try
a local market first,

213
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:34,386
so we opened up here in Camden.

214
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,867
We're actually opening up
a second location in Portland.

215
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:38,833
Part of our five-year plan.

216
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:43,656
Uh-huh. The antlers.
The ringtone.

217
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,876
Okay, I figured it out.
You're Mrs. Claus.

218
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:48,574
She is, actually,
even when it's not Christmas,

219
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:49,923
she's running around
in those silly antlers.

220
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:51,403
Uh, they're not silly.

221
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,456
Actually, I think
they're kinda cute.

222
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:56,981
See?

223
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:01,892
Ah, I'm running late. I gotta
head back to the North Pole.

224
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:04,989
-Santa's work is never done.
-Merry Christmas, Alma.

225
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:12,424
So, Charlie,
can I get you anything else?

226
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:15,522
-Charlie? Hello?
-Hm?

227
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,734
Oh. Sorry.

228
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:20,693
Um, can you recommend
a good florist in town?

229
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:23,051
I need a knock-your-socks-off
arrangement.

230
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:30,921
Hi.
-Hi.

231
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,705
I'm Charlie, this is Rohan.

232
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,576
-We're from the State of Maine.
-Hello.

233
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:36,100
We wanted to talk to you
about one of your trees.

234
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,197
Okay, come on in.

235
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:47,415
Oh, gosh. Ah...

236
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,896
I mean, I couldn't, I couldn't.
I'm stuffed.

237
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:53,944
-I can't.
- There she goes.

238
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:57,216
Oh. Oh, my God!

239
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,385
-Alma?
-Hi.

240
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:03,083
-You two know each other?
-Oh, we kind...

241
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:05,129
Well, it's kind of
a long story, dad.

242
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,000
Wait, you live here?

243
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,480
Alma's taking over
the house

244
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,048
when Marcus and I retire
next year. Yeah.

245
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:13,050
Did you know
that Charlie and Rohan

246
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,878
are from the governor's office?

247
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:17,228
-Wait, really?
-Yeah, they wanna use our tree.

248
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:18,620
As the official
State Christmas Tree

249
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,361
at the Capitol building
in Augusta.

250
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:21,623
What an honor, right?

251
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:24,322
-Wait, our tree?
-Yeah.

252
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,237
Yeah, we've never
had one from Camden before,

253
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:28,674
which is what makes it
so special.

254
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:30,458
W-well, there's probably

255
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:33,026
millions of trees in Maine.
Why ours?

256
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:34,941
Because that white spruce
in your backyard is the most

257
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:37,422
beautiful Christmas tree
I have ever seen.

258
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:39,598
I mean,
it was love at first sight.

259
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:42,470
Didn't the State Tree
already go up this year?

260
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,473
It did, but, um, it was
destroyed by an ice storm.

261
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:47,911
-Ah. We saw that on the news.
- Yeah, we did.

262
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:50,435
The top 20 feet
just snapped right off.

263
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:53,481
But I convinced them to push the
lighting back to Christmas Eve

264
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,048
if I promised to find them
a new tree in time.

265
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:56,658
-Oh, good.
- Yeah.

266
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:59,487
Charlie is known
as The Tree Whisperer.

267
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:01,620
-The Tree Whisperer?
-Oh, yeah.

268
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,014
She can find
the single-most perfect tree

269
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:05,580
in a forest of thousands.

270
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,581
Anyway, Rohan and I have been

271
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:07,887
flying over in a helicopter,

272
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,281
uh, surveying the local forests.

273
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:12,587
Oh, so that's what
all the noise has been.

274
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:14,067
Okay, I apologize, it's--

275
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:17,505
Oh, Charlie, it wasn't that bad.

276
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:19,551
Mom, you were complaining
about it just this morning.

277
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:20,813
Let her finish, sweetheart.

278
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,641
-

279
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:24,948
Our tree has a lot
of sentimental value,

280
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:27,515
not just to our family,
but to all of Camden.

281
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:29,691
It's a symbol of hope,
we do this big tree lighting

282
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:31,345
every year, it's a whole thing.

283
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,479
We need more
inspirational stories like that.

284
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:35,959
Donating your tree would ensure

285
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:38,526
that your family's legacy
lives on.

286
00:13:38,556 --> 00:13:40,354
Oh, that's true.
We won't be around forever.

287
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:41,878
Dad.

288
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,531
Well, I mean,
Charlie's got a point.

289
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,490
Trees have a life span,
just like us.

290
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,535
Yeah.

291
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:48,841
Look, take some time,
take some time.

292
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,625
You don't have to decide now.

293
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:52,200
Hm.

294
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,805
-Um, it was so nice meeting you.
-Gosh.

295
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,720
Alma, here, this is my card,
just take it, call me,

296
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,680
text me anytime
if you have any questions.

297
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,160
-Well...
-Come on, I'll walk you out.

298
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,031
It was such a pleasure
meeting both of you.

299
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:06,859
-Take care. We'll let you know.
-Bye.

300
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,521
Bye!

301
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:10,689
Huh!

302
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:11,951
I think we're gonna have
a problem.

303
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:14,562
What? No.
Alma will come around.

304
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:16,303
Nobody signs on the dotted line
after the first ask.

305
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,131
-I-I don't know about that.
-Look.

306
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:20,003
They're lovely people,
let's just give them some space.

307
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:22,483
Okay, but the tree
needs to be on a truck

308
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:23,615
to Augusta in a week.

309
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:25,399
Okay, okay. Slow down.

310
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:27,097
We will get that tree.

311
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,533
First we need to run
a property survey

312
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:31,275
and a title report
on the Beltran property.

313
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,494
-Okay.
-Deep breaths.

314
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:35,069
Okay.

315
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,897
We got this.

316
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:44,462
You guys aren't seriously
considering that, are you?

317
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:47,073
Honey, they said the state
would donate a thousand trees

318
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:49,684
to the community in our name,
imagine what that would do

319
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:51,904
to the reforestation project
in town.

320
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:54,298
I've spent every Christmas
with that tree.

321
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:56,917
I can't imagine the holidays
without it.

322
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:03,002
Boy, that Charlie
was something else, wasn't she?

323
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:06,136
We could sure use someone
like that on our sales team.

324
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,747
-Think she's gay?
-Dad!

325
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:12,055
-Of course she's gay.
-Hm.

326
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:14,796
Well, I think
it just might be

327
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:17,582
a fitting send-off
for us and the tree.

328
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:19,714
Well, it's not really
how I envisioned us

329
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:22,892
spending our last Christmas
together before you guys move.

330
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,371
Look, I'll get in touch
with her.

331
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:26,112
No, honey,
you've got a million things

332
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:29,115
on your plate.
Let me and your mom handle it.

333
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:31,161
I didn't realize
we'd come to a decision.

334
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:32,989
Well, I wasn't really thrilled
with her offer,

335
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:35,208
but she does have a job to do,
this wait gives her

336
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:38,037
more of a chance
to look for another tree.

337
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:40,866
I just don't wanna give her
false hope like I'm interested.

338
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:43,964
Like we're interested.

339
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:47,446
-Yeah.
-Sure.

340
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,627
Hm.

341
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:05,717
I just got off
the phone with Sonal.

342
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:09,242
I told her to tell the governor
that we have this in the bag.

343
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:10,635
But we don't.

344
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:11,636
You worry too much for somebody

345
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,203
your age. Relax.

346
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:14,726
Yeah, have another pastry.

347
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:16,641
Two shots, extra foam,

348
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:18,121
chocolate on the bottom,
cinnamon on top.

349
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:21,037
-Oh, you remembered.
-That's my job.

350
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:22,429
Have you been doing this
your whole life?

351
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:24,866
Oh, no, I had a big job
in publishing.

352
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,956
Corner office, view of Midtown,
the works.

353
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,262
And you walked away?

354
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:30,829
I was ready for a career change.

355
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:32,439
I always wanted to be a baker,

356
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:34,224
so I decided to follow my heart.

357
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:37,626
-I love my job, yup.
-Hm.

358
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,839
So were you always
just interested in food?

359
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:42,884
Oh, yeah, I was that 11-year-old

360
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:45,278
who was inside
analyzing brownie recipes

361
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:48,107
while everyone else was outside
playing soccer.

362
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:50,066
I think that's why
Alma and I connected.

363
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:52,416
She's the same kind of nerd,
except about Christmas.

364
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:55,114
Going into business with her
was a total no-brainer.

365
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:56,898
And I really like
her mom and dad.

366
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:58,161
Oh, you know the Beltrans
pretty well.

367
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,901
They're wonderful people.

368
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:02,948
Their tree-lighting event is
the event of the season!

369
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:05,219
Everyone in town goes.

370
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,779
Ah, I see
you have their catalog.

371
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:09,911
Yeah, it was in the gift basket
in my room.

372
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:12,914
-It's absolutely beautiful.
-All Alma.

373
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:14,351
Huh.

374
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:17,832
Totally retro. Cool.

375
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:19,095
It's filled with
everything you could possibly

376
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,400
want or need for Christmas.

377
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,663
Here, check out this back cover.

378
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:25,369
Aww. Adorbs.

379
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,072
You sure you don't wanna
think about that a little more?

380
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,292
Her offer was pretty compelling.

381
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:45,738
-It's a no, mom.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

382
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:49,299
Should I call her?

383
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,518
Why don't you, um...

384
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:53,433
Why don't you go tell her
in person?

385
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:56,132
I saw them just now
over at Noelle's.

386
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:59,135
No, no, no, I'll-I'll,
I'll just text her.

387
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:02,007
Or should I go over there?
Or is that too obvious?

388
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:04,923
Like, too obv... Well, it's not
like you're asking her out.

389
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:06,968
No. No, no, no. Of course not.

390
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:08,970
-No. No.
-Yeah?

391
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,713
I mean, yeah, no, it just,
it can get confusing, you know?

392
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:15,194
Yeah. No. No, totally.

393
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:18,154
I just, I wanna let her down
easy is what I'm trying to say.

394
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:20,156
-Oh. Yeah.
-So...

395
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:22,549
So, yeah, so...

396
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:25,074
I'm gonna text her. I'm gonna
text her. I'm gonna text her.

397
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,598
Here we go. Thank you
for helping me figure that out.

398
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:30,783
-Anytime. Anytime, sweetheart.
-Yeah.

399
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:35,606
Okay, so what do we do next?

400
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:38,304
I think
she's gonna reach out first.

401
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:40,393
This is gonna be
the easiest assignment ever.

402
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,352
But maybe we could just,
like, call her.

403
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:44,397
-Ugh.
-

404
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:47,226
What did I tell you?
You're working with a pro.

405
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:50,324
Hey, Marie,
break out the champagne.

406
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,626
"Good morning, Charlie,
we have considered your offer.

407
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:57,541
And while we find it
immensely flattering,

408
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:59,934
we have decided to decline."

409
00:18:59,964 --> 00:19:04,548
The Beltran tree will remain

410
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:07,551
standing tall and proud

411
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:10,649
here in Camden.

412
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,340
Good luck.

413
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,959
-Yeah.
-Hey.

414
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,260
-She's still a maybe.
-She just said no.

415
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,654
That's just her opening serve.
I would've done the same thing.

416
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:25,569
That sounded pretty final to me.

417
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,484
Doesn't Puff Daddy need
another feeding or something?

418
00:19:27,514 --> 00:19:28,971
Cheers.

419
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,192
Don't give up.

420
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:48,164
You have got to be kidding me.

421
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:53,771
Ugh. Charlie?

422
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:54,989
Hope you don't mind
that I stopped by.

423
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:56,426
No, no, not at all.

424
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:58,906
But I thought
you'd be gone by now.

425
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:01,648
-Did you not get my text?
-Yeah.

426
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:03,563
Look, I just wanted to talk
to you about this catalog.

427
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:05,565
This is incredible, Alma,
it's clear

428
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,611
that you've put your heart
and soul into every page.

429
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:09,743
Thank you, there's not
a single item in there

430
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:12,050
that I wouldn't give
as a Christmas gift to myself.

431
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,887
Well, then I need to get you
my wish list.

432
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:19,013
-What's all this?
-Ugh.

433
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:21,538
The vendor thought
we wanted them disassembled.

434
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:24,018
Like, we get a lot of orders
for decapitated nutcrackers.

435
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:25,890
-Harr-harr-harr...
-That's terrifying.

436
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,197
Yeah, 300 of them are scheduled
to go out in the morning.

437
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,511
-Oh, that's awful.
-Yeah.

438
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,332
-You good with arms and legs?
-Yeah.

439
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:36,205
-You want a hand?
-No, no, I was just kidding.

440
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,642
No, no, no, part of my job
is to, you know, get to know

441
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:40,992
our local businesses
and assess their needs.

442
00:20:41,022 --> 00:20:43,864
-Really? You wanna help?
-Yeah.

443
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:47,694
Yeah. Let's get
these bad boys crackin'.

444
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:49,653
-Ooh.
-It felt wrong coming out.

445
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:51,750
Five out of ten.
Five out of ten.

446
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:57,313
-So where's Rohan?
-Ooh, he's with Marie.

447
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:59,924
And they're bonding
over Christmas croquembouche,

448
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:01,447
whatever that is.

449
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:02,970
What are the chances
I would meet her

450
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,017
at some random little bakery
in Paris, right?

451
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:07,888
You know, nothing's random.

452
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:09,281
Well, the next person you meet
could be the person

453
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,682
who changes your life.

454
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:17,637
This warehouse is really nice.

455
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:21,293
-So much natural light.
-Yeah. Thanks.

456
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,816
Before I moved back,
it was full of these,

457
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:24,905
like, dark cubbyhole offices.

458
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:27,952
But since we opened it up, the
energy levels have skyrocketed.

459
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:29,649
Sounds like you really like
what you do.

460
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,608
Oh, yeah. Well...

461
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:33,740
When you celebrate Christmas
365 days a year,

462
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,090
you got to really love it.

463
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,050
-Even in the summer?
-Oh, especially in the summer.

464
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,183
-Yikes!
-Christmas in July is the best!

465
00:21:42,213 --> 00:21:45,099
Every day is a reason to eat
eggnog ice cream. Come on.

466
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:46,587
Wow.

467
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:50,104
Hm...

468
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:52,193
Ta-da!

469
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:55,501
Oh. You did that on purpose.

470
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:59,636
-I did not.
-What is this creature?

471
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,378
Did you not play with dolls
as a child?

472
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:06,817
No. Dolls creeped me out.
I liked to play in the garden.

473
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:10,037
My dad had a nursery. That's
how I became a tree expert.

474
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:13,135
Which is why your family tree
speaks to my heart.

475
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:16,609
Everyone in town
has a story about her.

476
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:20,396
Okay, that I wanna hear.
Tell me about it.

477
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:24,313
They played under her as a kid
or got engaged there.

478
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,966
I'm gonna get married there
one day.

479
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:27,628
Someday?

480
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:32,328
I'm single,
if that's what you're asking.

481
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:37,456
Okay, I got to be honest
with you, Alma.

482
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:40,329
My whole job is riding on this,
the governor thought

483
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,332
last year's tree
was a little too Charlie Brown.

484
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,334
And then there was
a stowaway owl

485
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,596
who came all the way to Augusta
with us.

486
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:49,033
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

487
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:51,296
-What happened to him again?
-I called him Kris Kringle.

488
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:52,819
And I found him a new home

489
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:54,734
at a wildlife refuge
not far from here.

490
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:57,520
-Wait, that was you?
-Yeah.

491
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,957
I got him a grant from the State
and everything.

492
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:03,316
He's the only owl I know who's
the CEO of his own foundation.

493
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:05,231
Hm.

494
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:10,366
Well, that was fun.

495
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,064
Oh.

496
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:18,157
Mm.
-Really?

497
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:23,894
-Well, did you get her to sign?
-She's single.

498
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:28,551
-Hello?

499
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:30,204
The governor loved the video.

500
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:32,511
What's the schedule on
contracts and permits?

501
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,600
-We're on it.
- Good.

502
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,437
All eyes are on you, Charlotte.
Talk soon.

503
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:42,913
What? Relax, Rohan,
it's all part of the job.

504
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:45,184
W-what-what are we gonna do now?

505
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,927
It's our job. Come on.
Follow me.

506
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,052
-Hey, Isabella.
-Oh, hey, guys.

507
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:53,184
Can we give you a hand
with that?

508
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:55,491
Yeah, sure. I'd love that.

509
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:58,102
Oh, I just saw your warehouse.
What an amazing place!

510
00:23:58,132 --> 00:24:00,496
I know, isn't it? Isn't it?
A lot of history.

511
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:02,846
But Alma is really gonna
take this company new places.

512
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:05,414
Yeah, I'm certain she will.

513
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,199
Hey, listen, I just wanted
to apologize for yesterday.

514
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:13,030
What? Why? No, no, no.
We loved the presentation.

515
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,511
If it wasn't for Alma,
we were ready to say yes.

516
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,391
Oh. Well,
maybe she'll change her mind.

517
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:21,342
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

518
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:23,780
So what's all this?

519
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,652
Well, this is our annual
holiday school fundraiser.

520
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,437
A gingerbread house
building competition.

521
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,396
But between us,
Alma has came in second place

522
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:33,485
for the last two years
and it is killing her.

523
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,269
She likes to succeed
at everything she does.

524
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:36,662
-Yeah, I can tell.
-Yeah.

525
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:39,491
So she's been prepping
since September.

526
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:43,103
Oh, hey,
why don't you guys stop by?

527
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:45,497
You can maybe even sign up
for a team.

528
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:47,891
Oh, you know, I don't know
the first thing about ginger--

529
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:51,372
Oh, no, Charlie was just
telling me how much she loves

530
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:52,722
to step outside
of her comfort zone.

531
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:55,289
Perfect.
I could introduce you around.

532
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,900
I think this would be
a really nice way

533
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,510
for you to get to know
the community.

534
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,120
-Hm...
-Okay, yeah.

535
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,513
-That sounds wonderful.
-Good.

536
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,820
-Yeah, maybe I will. Okay.
-Great!

537
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,778
Okay. Are you sure you don't
need help with this?

538
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:07,519
Look, Rohan will be happy
to lift the heavy boxes.

539
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:10,566
No, no, I'm fine.
I'm gonna see you later.

540
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:13,003
-Okay. Okay. Great. Bye.
-Okay!

541
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,621
-Buh-bye!
- Ciao!

542
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,364
-Oh!
-Oh! Sorry!

543
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,540
-Hi!
-Hi. Hi. Hey.

544
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,499
I-I thought I heard someone,
I just, I wanted

545
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,631
to drop this off,
spirit of the season and all.

546
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:35,895
Well, gifts might work for my
parents, but they're not gonna--

547
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:37,941
Oh, no, no, no, no! I just
wanted to thank your mom.

548
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:40,683
She offered to introduce me
to some people in town.

549
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:43,642
-Did she?
-She's really great.

550
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:45,905
Well, I would invite you inside,
but I'm just, uh,

551
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:47,603
closing up the chicken coop
for the night.

552
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:50,606
-Oh, can I meet them?
-Oh, the girls are sleeping.

553
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:53,225
Oh. Yeah, sure.
That's, that's okay.

554
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,873
But we can just pop in
and say hello

555
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:58,222
just as long as we're quiet.

556
00:25:58,252 --> 00:25:59,927
Okay.

557
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:02,408
Come on.

558
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:08,754
Oh...

559
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:11,844
Oh, I love that photo of you
and the chickens in the catalog.

560
00:26:11,874 --> 00:26:13,890
Oh, thanks.

561
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,327
My dad and I built the coop
when I was seven.

562
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:18,024
-Is there anything you can't do?
-Uh...

563
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:20,113
I've been building things
my whole life.

564
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:22,202
Birdhouses, mailboxes.

565
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:24,778
-Barbie's dream house.
-Right.

566
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:31,081
-

567
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:34,780
-Hey. Yeah.
-They're my council of advisors.

568
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,260
Every time
I'm stuck on something,

569
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,610
I come and sit with the girls.

570
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,743
They've helped me make
some really big decisions.

571
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:43,572
Wow. It's like having four
therapists in your backyard.

572
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,184
-Ooh, sorry, Mary B!

573
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:50,143
-We didn't mean to disturb you.
-They have names?

574
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:53,364
Yeah. Of course. They're family.

575
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:55,758
That one, that's Mary B.

576
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:57,237
She's the mother hen.
She's the biggest.

577
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:59,805
-Uh-huh.
-And that one is Susan.

578
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:01,981
-Our youngest.
-

579
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:04,767
And Betty and Judy are sisters.

580
00:27:04,797 --> 00:27:06,246
Who are they named for?

581
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:08,074
It's a riddle,
no one's been able

582
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:09,772
to figure it out,
except my parents.

583
00:27:09,802 --> 00:27:12,383
Oh, come on,
it can't be that difficult.

584
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:14,472
Well, Judy is for Judy Garland,
right?

585
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:16,090
Mn-mn.

586
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:19,912
Okay. Give me a hint.

587
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:23,699
Figuring out the riddle is the
first step to figuring out me.

588
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,614
Uh-huh.

589
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:29,008
Okay, let's let them sleep.

590
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,626
Goodnight.

591
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,408
Betty as in Bette Davis, right?

592
00:27:37,438 --> 00:27:40,193
I did not name my chickens
after gay divas.

593
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:42,369
Why not?
That would have been fun.

594
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,068
-Bettie Page?
-Mm. Mn-mn.

595
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:47,853
Mm... Betty, Betty White?

596
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:49,420
No, but good.

597
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,943
My God, this is gonna
drive me nuts!

598
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,945
-I'm gonna be up all night.
-Hm.

599
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:55,339
Oh! Betty Crocker.

600
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:57,210
Betty Crocker?

601
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,951
Come on!

602
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:01,222
It's a Christmas, no?
It's a sound gap.

603
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:22,714
-Honey, it's not MMA.
-Uh-uh.

604
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,629
There is no way
I'm coming in second place

605
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,587
again this year, dad.
I'm taking no chances.

606
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:28,111
There definitely seems to be

607
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:30,026
some pretty fierce competition
this year.

608
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:32,115
Yes, Marie, thank you.
I'm aware.

609
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:34,073
I've been scoping everyone out.

610
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:36,467
I've gotta
psych myself up.

611
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:38,730
You got this. Look,
you've been practicing forever.

612
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,558
The YouTube videos,
the gingerbread houses.

613
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:42,429
Honey, I've gained five pounds

614
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:44,040
since you started training
for this thing.

615
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,346
Look, Alma, just
remember, there's nothing wrong

616
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:49,741
with second place.
Okay, I gotta go. Good luck.

617
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,526
And most importantly, have fun!

618
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:55,138
Yeah. And have fun, but win.

619
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,530
-Mm-hmm.
-Give me that.

620
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,534
-Uh, it's, uh, Charlie.

621
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:02,580
-Hi. Oh, hey.
-Hey.

622
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,104
Oh, no... What?
Oh, your mom invited her.

623
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:06,584
Thought it might help
with her work.

624
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:09,116
Of course.
-You have fun. Win.

625
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:13,286
Charlie. Hey. What a surprise.

626
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:16,376
Oh, looking sharp, Alma.

627
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:18,727
Uh, you know those aprons are
only for competitors, right?

628
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,337
Yeah, this is gonna be
so much fun.

629
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:22,643
Uh, it takes years
to hone your skills.

630
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:24,080
This is a very serious
competition.

631
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,516
Ah, wouldn't it be great

632
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:27,866
if we were on the same team?

633
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:30,390
Oh, come on!
You're gonna be fine.

634
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,132
Okay, I gotta get a picture
of you in this vest.

635
00:29:33,162 --> 00:29:34,351
What's wrong with my craft vest?

636
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:35,961
Uh, strike a pose,

637
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:37,615
or act natural, that's fine. Oh.

638
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:39,138
It's wrong on so many levels.

639
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:41,793
That's why
I love it so much.

640
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:44,187
I also have a sewing vest
and a baking vest.

641
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:45,579
Why am I not surprised?

642
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:48,539
Welcome, welcome, everyone!

643
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:51,934
Oh, I am so thrilled
to see all of you here.

644
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:55,415
As you know, the money we raise
will go towards supporting

645
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:57,200
our school's
fine arts programming.

646
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,245
So thank you,
thank you for your generosity.

647
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:01,124
Yeah!

648
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:04,381
Now, we are so honored this year

649
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:08,167
to have
two of the city's top chefs

650
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:10,213
on our judging panel.

651
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:13,085
Well, we have Marie Gauthier
of Noelle's Patisserie.

652
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:15,958
-

653
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:18,787
And Elena Nikas
of Nikas Greek Taverna.

654
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,319
Yay!
-Thank you, Elena.

655
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:26,628
Okay, I want a drumroll, please.

656
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:31,285
We are choosing our teams! Okay.

657
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:34,106
-We have Franny Wong.
-Oh!

658
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:37,066
Oh, and Sara Wong!

659
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:39,242
Whoo! Go, ladies.

660
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:42,419
I think this is our very first
mother-daughter team.

661
00:30:42,449 --> 00:30:44,856
This is
my worst nightmare.

662
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:47,467
-What?
-Okay, you see those two?

663
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:49,556
Granny is former
Army Corps of Engineers

664
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:51,645
and the Goth is on a scholarship

665
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:53,952
at Rhode Island
School of Design.

666
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:55,911
For the past couple of years,
one of them has always been on

667
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:57,695
the winning team, if they get
on the same team this year,

668
00:30:57,725 --> 00:31:00,437
I am screwed.

669
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,178
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

670
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:05,050
I wasn't really one of those
crafty kids in school.

671
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,096
Play-Doh,
it's mostly for eating, right?

672
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:08,975
Uh, uh...

673
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:13,632
Beth Langand and...

674
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:16,061
Karla Thomas.

675
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:18,281
Yay! Whoo-hoo!

676
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:21,762
Oh, no, Beth! Oh, okay.

677
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,677
I'm so excited.

678
00:31:23,707 --> 00:31:26,862
Oh, Alma Beltran...

679
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:31,294
and Charlie Freemont!

680
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:32,643
-What? Me?
-

681
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:35,428
-Yes!
-Yeah! We're on the same team!

682
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,256
How cool is that?

683
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:40,093
Okay! I'll go get ready.

684
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,396
Okay. Here's my shopping list.

685
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:47,745
We need to get
every single item on that.

686
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:48,833
-Got it.
-All right, competitors.

687
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:50,748
When I ring the bell,

688
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:52,750
the elves' workshop
will be open

689
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,361
for five minutes
and five minutes only.

690
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:58,756
So get everything you need,
because there are no exchanges.

691
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:03,282
There are no refunds,
and all sales are final.

692
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:05,110
Dude, you need to chill.

693
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,720
Did you read Lord Of The Flies
in high school?

694
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,549
Yeah, I hated that book.
It's the worst of the patriar--

695
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:11,812
Well, get ready,
'cause you're about to live it.

696
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:14,163
I'll get the coconut.
Get the dragees.

697
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:15,729
-What the hell are dragees?
-

698
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,913
-Go!
-

699
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:21,997
Go. Okay. Wait a minute!

700
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:23,999
Wait! Okay, okay!

701
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:25,565
You can't do that! There's
none left for anybody else.

702
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:26,871
You snooze, you lose!

703
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:29,569
...do with 20 squeeze bottles?

704
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,274
Oh. Ah!

705
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:36,584
Oh, these are so cute.

706
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:41,459
Oh, I love these.

707
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:44,671
Oh. Yeah... Whoa.

708
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:46,812
Oh, my God!

709
00:32:49,141 --> 00:32:50,851
Whoa, whoa!

710
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:52,948
Okay.
-Um...

711
00:32:54,624 --> 00:32:56,169
Okay.

712
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:04,213
That was a lot of cardio.

713
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,911
I didn't get
half of what I needed.

714
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:10,088
-Oh.
-Cotton batting?

715
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:12,838
Snow?
-Ugh.

716
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:19,968
Charlie, w-what are you doing?

717
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,753
Doing my Snoopy dance from
It's A Charlie Brown Christmas.

718
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:24,885
What are we celebrating?

719
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:26,800
-Santa came early.
-Oh, my...

720
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,021
-How did you do that?

721
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:32,284
The tree whisperer
is also a stealth shopper.

722
00:33:32,314 --> 00:33:34,199
Wow, when I first met you,

723
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:35,722
I thought you were all cool
and laid-back.

724
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:37,724
But that's a cover.
You're cuckoo bananas.

725
00:33:37,754 --> 00:33:40,466
Says the lady in the craft vest?

726
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:42,345
Hey, you wanna win this thing?

727
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:45,131
Let's get to work.

728
00:33:47,764 --> 00:33:50,389
So what exactly
are we building?

729
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:52,913
George and Mary Bailey's house
in Bedford Falls.

730
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:55,533
-Oh, from It's A Wonderful Life.
-Yeah.

731
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:34,093
Easy. Easy.

732
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,922
Ooh...

733
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:47,577
We're gonna crush you,
Alma Beltran.

734
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,753
You wish,
I've got a killer partner

735
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:51,407
and we take no prisoners.
Am I right, Charlie?

736
00:34:51,437 --> 00:34:52,938
Yeah!

737
00:34:54,353 --> 00:34:56,637
Hi.

738
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:02,244
-Oh... Look at that thing!
- It's a masterpiece.

739
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:04,202
Sorry, George and Mary Bailey.

740
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:06,473
There's no way
we can compete with that.

741
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:16,614
Three, two, one!
Time's up, bakers!

742
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:23,482
We present "The Nightmare
Before Christmas,"

743
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:25,623
Camden style.

744
00:35:26,776 --> 00:35:28,705
-Oh.

745
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:31,186
And, you know, I have never seen
black frosting before, have you?

746
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:33,753
Totally surprising
and unexpected. Well done.

747
00:35:33,783 --> 00:35:36,808
Innovative
and off-the-charts fun.

748
00:35:45,578 --> 00:35:48,203
Welcome to
George and Mary Bailey's House

749
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:51,119
in Bedford Falls.

750
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,686
It's both practical
and fanciful.

751
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:56,211
I love what you two have done
with the dragees.

752
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:58,387
Amazing execution.

753
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:00,389
All the skill is here
as well as the artistry.

754
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:02,660
Brilliant work, ladies.

755
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:10,529
That was good, right? Okay.

756
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:12,966
It's been
a whirlwind of a competition.

757
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:16,231
So much talent and style
on display.

758
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:18,494
You are all winners here.

759
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:21,236
But only one team will take home

760
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:24,500
our coveted Gingerbread Trophy.

761
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:27,198
All right, judges, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

762
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:30,557
We are down to the final two.

763
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:33,117
You should be proud, Alma.

764
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:34,205
Look how far we've come.

765
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:36,555
The team with the highest score,

766
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:41,081
who brought Christmas magic
to life as we know it.

767
00:36:41,111 --> 00:36:42,735
First prize

768
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:46,913
goes to

769
00:36:46,943 --> 00:36:49,699
Alma and Charlie for their
It's A Wonderful Lifehouse!

770
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:51,701
-Oh, Alma, you won!
-

771
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:55,625
- You deserved it.

772
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:04,714
Okay, here we go.
Hey, hey!

773
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:06,542
This is my first time
having glogg.

774
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:09,501
Well, another reason
to celebrate. I mean...

775
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:11,590
I still can't believe we won!

776
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,331
Um, usually
I'm not a competitive person.

777
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:17,205
Ah, you are the most competitive
person I've ever met.

778
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,032
No, no,
that's you, Alma.

779
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:21,513
Never ever trust the quiet ones
with the sweet smile.

780
00:37:21,543 --> 00:37:24,473
-You two make a great team.
-Hm.

781
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:26,605
A toast to our two

782
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:29,260
fearless gingerbread warriors

783
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,784
and their sweet, sweet smiles.

784
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:33,221
I got one better.

785
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:37,580
-To the lesbians!
-To the lesbians!

786
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:41,316
I have a question.

787
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:43,666
How does this work?

788
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:45,755
I-I was thinking joint custody?

789
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:50,194
Ah... Yeah,
I don't know how that works.

790
00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:52,944
Alma, could you give
me a hand in here, sweetheart?

791
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,773
Uh-oh.

792
00:37:57,013 --> 00:37:58,471
Yeah.

793
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:19,979
Oh! Sorry. I didn't, uh--

794
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:23,026
No, please,
it's, it's beautiful.

795
00:39:23,056 --> 00:39:24,810
Who's the musician
in the family?

796
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,030
Oh, my parents,
well, they started me on lessons

797
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,119
before I was tall enough
to hit the keyboard.

798
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:32,601
-Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to--
-No, no, please. Just...

799
00:39:32,631 --> 00:39:35,212
I was really enjoying that.

800
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:37,570
Our house hasn't seen music
in ages.

801
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,567
-Come on. Join me.
-No. Go, go, go, go.

802
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:44,917
You know, me and my dad
used to play this song.

803
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:46,919
Everybody always thinks
it's such a sad song,

804
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:48,878
but I don't think so.

805
00:39:48,908 --> 00:39:52,098
Exactly, right? I mean,
it's such a hopeful song.

806
00:39:52,128 --> 00:39:54,013
Raise a cup of kindness
to old friends

807
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:55,893
and remember the good times.

808
00:39:56,698 --> 00:39:58,322
It's a beautiful song.

809
00:39:58,352 --> 00:40:00,629
"It's all in how you play it."

810
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:02,718
That's what my dad used to say.

811
00:40:02,748 --> 00:40:04,423
Yeah.

812
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:40,938
Oh.

813
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:20,499
Brava, brava!

814
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:25,322
-Dad, that was beautiful.
-Oh, just like old days.

815
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:27,585
Yeah, my fingers remember
what to do.

816
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:29,674
Well, it's clear
you've had a lot of training.

817
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:31,328
You know,
the first time I met Marcus,

818
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:33,896
he was the lead singer
of a band.

819
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:37,769
And, uh, boy, he was the
handsomest guy I'd ever seen.

820
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:39,771
I was just smitten.

821
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:42,869
-He won my heart instantly.
-Aww.

822
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:48,780
I can't thank you enough for
getting my dad to play tonight.

823
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:51,130
He's a natural talent.

824
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,393
Oh, by the way, I still haven't
figured out your chicken riddle.

825
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:55,526
I've searched everywhere.

826
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:56,788
There's no connection
between the names.

827
00:41:56,818 --> 00:41:58,363
Hm.

828
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,542
Come on.
I wanna show you something.

829
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,687
Wow. It's even more
beautiful in the moonlight.

830
00:42:20,712 --> 00:42:21,987
You know,
the favorite part of my job

831
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:24,215
is finding a tree like yours.

832
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:31,127
How's the search coming?

833
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:35,922
Actually, I was kind of hoping
you were having second thoughts?

834
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,092
-You never give up, do you?
-No.

835
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:44,009
Not when I find something
I really like.

836
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:47,273
Don't worry, I'm still looking,
I'm still playing the field.

837
00:42:47,303 --> 00:42:50,067
But there's only one tree
who's captured my heart.

838
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:55,717
I should get going.

839
00:42:55,747 --> 00:42:58,458
Thank you
for an incredible day, Alma.

840
00:42:58,488 --> 00:43:00,555
Goodnight, Charlie.

841
00:43:13,373 --> 00:43:14,910
DJ booth can go here.

842
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,086
Oh, and we'll put the desserts
over on that table.

843
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:18,914
I am so excited.

844
00:43:18,944 --> 00:43:21,264
You guys throw the best
Christmas parties in town.

845
00:43:21,294 --> 00:43:24,136
-

846
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,798
Do you hear that?

847
00:43:26,429 --> 00:43:27,974
What?

848
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:31,760
There's a drone outside.

849
00:43:32,827 --> 00:43:34,763
I swear I didn't.

850
00:43:51,454 --> 00:43:54,783
- Ooh. Oh.

851
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:03,132
"You are invited to a very
special holiday dinner tonight.

852
00:44:03,162 --> 00:44:07,266
Meet me at Noelle's at 6:00.
The Drone Lady."

853
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:09,181
You knew about this.

854
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:10,443
I don't know
what you're talking about.

855
00:44:10,473 --> 00:44:13,316
You're the worst liar ever.

856
00:44:13,346 --> 00:44:15,623
But there's no way
I'm gonna be done by 6:00

857
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,668
I have a stack of orders to fill
from three days ago.

858
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:21,063
You have been working 24/7.
You deserve this.

859
00:44:21,093 --> 00:44:24,762
-Take my advice, say yes.
-I always take your advice.

860
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:26,721
Oh, really? Then why are we
still having this conversation?

861
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,244
'Cause she's just here
for a few more days.

862
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:29,506
She's just passing through.

863
00:44:29,536 --> 00:44:31,116
I don't recall
an expiration date

864
00:44:31,146 --> 00:44:34,032
stamped on her forehead.

865
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:37,296
-What if I'm not ready?
-Nobody's ever ready.

866
00:44:37,326 --> 00:44:41,170
That's when the magic happens.
Trust me.

867
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,093
Better yet, trust yourself.

868
00:44:53,038 --> 00:44:54,836
-Come on, honey. Goin' home.
-Mm-hmm.

869
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:58,013
Oh, no, no, no, babe.
Just another hour.

870
00:44:58,043 --> 00:45:00,145
Honey, we've been here
since 7 a.m.

871
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:02,539
I ordered food, we're picking
it up on the way. Come on.

872
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:04,715
You know what,
I just wanna finish up

873
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,543
this new inventory program
for Alma.

874
00:45:06,573 --> 00:45:08,327
Honey, she can call us
when we're in Florida

875
00:45:08,357 --> 00:45:10,765
if she has any questions,
come on.

876
00:45:10,795 --> 00:45:12,723
By the way, where is she?

877
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:14,594
She... What? Oh.

878
00:45:14,624 --> 00:45:17,075
-Oh!
-What happened?

879
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:22,088
Marie helped Charlie
engineer a night out for her.

880
00:45:23,546 --> 00:45:25,388
-You mean, like a date?
-Shh!

881
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:29,392
We were strictly forbidden
to use that word as per Marie,

882
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:33,831
but, yes, it's a date!

883
00:45:33,861 --> 00:45:34,963
-Yeah.
-

884
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:36,921
Oh. Sorry.

885
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:39,315
It's just
the consultant's final report.

886
00:45:39,345 --> 00:45:41,273
I've been waiting
for this darn thing all day.

887
00:45:41,303 --> 00:45:43,885
Honey, please, come on,
after dinner.

888
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:47,671
Please. Honey, you have your own
hot date, you know?

889
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:50,500
-What, were you... I...
-Yeah.

890
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:55,026
Oh, so I do. Mm.

891
00:45:55,056 --> 00:45:59,378
The most handsome guy in Camden.

892
00:45:59,408 --> 00:46:01,163
Just Camden?

893
00:46:01,193 --> 00:46:04,862
What? No. No.
In the entire state of Maine.

894
00:46:04,892 --> 00:46:07,089
-Oh, that's better.
-Mm.

895
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,130
upon the tree

896
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,925
I need

897
00:46:22,692 --> 00:46:26,021
think I know where you'll go

898
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:29,582
Okay, I'm gonna need your phone.

899
00:46:29,612 --> 00:46:32,455
-Wha...
-No distractions.

900
00:46:32,485 --> 00:46:34,639
Okay, fine by me.

901
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:39,070
So how did you pull this off?

902
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,464
I asked Marie if I could rent
the place for the evening.

903
00:46:41,494 --> 00:46:43,474
She was delighted.

904
00:46:44,192 --> 00:46:45,903
May I take your coat?

905
00:46:45,933 --> 00:46:48,000
Oh, thank you.

906
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,261
I asked her about
all your favorite meals.

907
00:46:56,291 --> 00:47:00,396
But you're not cooking, right?

908
00:47:00,426 --> 00:47:03,007
Marie's here,
hiding in the back somewhere?

909
00:47:03,037 --> 00:47:06,837
-No, I gave her the night off.
-Oh!

910
00:47:06,867 --> 00:47:09,100
But she did make everything
in advance.

911
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:11,850
So I just have to heat it up.

912
00:47:14,005 --> 00:47:16,985
-You're good at this.
-Yeah.

913
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:21,112
think I know where

914
00:47:21,142 --> 00:47:23,035
Mm.

915
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:28,214
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

916
00:47:34,373 --> 00:47:36,214
Shouldn't you go check on that?

917
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:38,129
No, it'll be fine.

918
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:39,783
That's not how
kitchen timers work.

919
00:47:39,813 --> 00:47:41,959
Okay, you need to relax.

920
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:44,875
You don't always need to know
where we're going.

921
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:48,139
Sometimes
the destination finds you.

922
00:47:48,169 --> 00:47:51,368
-You're probably right.
-Mm-hmm.

923
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:54,537
So did you spend a lot of time

924
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:56,321
cooking with your mom
when you were a kid?

925
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:59,411
No. No, mom and I
were shopping buddies.

926
00:47:59,441 --> 00:48:02,371
When I was a kid, we'd do this
big shopping trip to New York

927
00:48:02,401 --> 00:48:04,242
every year for Thanksgiving.

928
00:48:04,272 --> 00:48:06,766
I just loved looking
at all the store windows.

929
00:48:06,796 --> 00:48:09,291
-Where is your mom?
-She lives in Seattle now.

930
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:11,467
Near my brother and his family.

931
00:48:11,497 --> 00:48:13,425
What about your dad?

932
00:48:13,455 --> 00:48:15,819
He passed away.

933
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:19,431
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

934
00:48:19,461 --> 00:48:21,564
The nursery was
the most wonderful place

935
00:48:21,594 --> 00:48:23,740
to spend the holidays.

936
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:26,272
Talk about a magical Christmas.

937
00:48:29,254 --> 00:48:32,104
Feelin' kinda disconnected
since we sold it.

938
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:35,281
That's tough.

939
00:48:36,826 --> 00:48:38,929
Well, you seem close
with your parents.

940
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:40,409
Uh, my mom and I

941
00:48:40,439 --> 00:48:44,587
are a lot alike.

942
00:48:44,617 --> 00:48:48,591
But growing up I was always
building things with my dad.

943
00:48:48,621 --> 00:48:51,899
We had something really special
together.

944
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,161
I feel lucky
having both of them.

945
00:48:53,191 --> 00:48:55,467
Hm. Yeah.

946
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:57,825
My dad knew I was gay
before I did.

947
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,440
He didn't care who I loved,
he just wanted me to be loved.

948
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:09,351
Shouldn't you check on dinner?

949
00:49:09,381 --> 00:49:12,441
Don't worry, Marie left me
step-by-step instructions.

950
00:49:12,471 --> 00:49:14,008
Some of them seemed
a little unnecessary,

951
00:49:14,038 --> 00:49:17,054
so, so I just skipped it.

952
00:49:17,084 --> 00:49:19,491
I don't think you can do that.

953
00:49:19,521 --> 00:49:22,320
Yeah, the people on TV cooking
shows do it all the time.

954
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:23,495
It's like magic.

955
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:27,108
Okay. You're the chef.

956
00:49:27,138 --> 00:49:31,025
Speaking of magic, I've been
meaning to give you something.

957
00:49:31,055 --> 00:49:33,723
Have you ever been to the Camden
reforestation project?

958
00:49:33,753 --> 00:49:37,640
It's just outside of town,
amazing little place.

959
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:40,686
That's where you should be
looking for your Christmas tree.

960
00:49:40,716 --> 00:49:44,647
Some of them have been around
for almost 300 years.

961
00:49:44,677 --> 00:49:48,303
They could use someone like you
with your expertise over there.

962
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:50,566
They lost a lot of their staff
to retirement.

963
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:53,968
They're not getting people our
age to work up there anymore.

964
00:49:56,602 --> 00:49:59,017
Uh, do you smell smoke?

965
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:08,149
Uh, do you need help?

966
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:10,637
No, everything's
under control.

967
00:50:23,716 --> 00:50:25,522
Why don't we go
right to dessert?

968
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,519
God! That Buche de
Noel tastes just like Christmas.

969
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:33,565
What did I tell you,
Marie's a genius. Mm...

970
00:50:33,595 --> 00:50:36,568
Uh, you got, you got
a little something right there.

971
00:50:36,598 --> 00:50:38,744
Oh, you think
I'm falling for that old trick?

972
00:50:38,774 --> 00:50:41,530
-I know you just wanna kiss me.
-What? No, I don't.

973
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,446
I didn't mean it
like that.

974
00:50:44,476 --> 00:50:45,751
You know what I mean, right?

975
00:50:45,781 --> 00:50:47,239
Mm-hmm.

976
00:50:48,871 --> 00:50:52,549
But seriously, you do actually
have, uh, just a little...

977
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:57,067
Oh.

978
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:59,722
No, wait, I don't,
I don't think you got it.

979
00:50:59,752 --> 00:51:01,906
Can you try again?

980
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:13,083
-Wait a minute.
-What? What's wrong?

981
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:15,049
Wait a minute.

982
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:19,089
-The riddle.
-What riddle?

983
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,613
Your riddle,
the riddle of the chickens.

984
00:51:21,643 --> 00:51:24,138
Um, Mary B,
she's the mother hen.

985
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:26,749
She is Mary Bailey in
It's A Wonderful Life.

986
00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:28,794
Oh, of course,
our gingerbread house.

987
00:51:28,824 --> 00:51:30,840
You've been paying attention.

988
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,321
And Susan, wasn't Susan
Natalie Wood's name

989
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:35,062
on Miracle On 34th Street?

990
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:38,021
Two out of four, you're on fire!

991
00:51:38,051 --> 00:51:40,763
Okay, I'm just a little stuck
on Betty and Judy.

992
00:51:40,793 --> 00:51:41,720
It's gotta be
another Christmas movie.

993
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,896
Mm.

994
00:51:43,926 --> 00:51:47,299
Remember, they are sisters.

995
00:51:47,626 --> 00:51:50,686
Sister? Mm...

996
00:51:50,716 --> 00:51:53,167
Wait! Oh, sisters?

997
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:55,473
Uh, White Christmas,
Rosemary Clooney

998
00:51:55,503 --> 00:51:58,563
and Vera-Ellen, uh, Betty
and Judy in the Sistersong!

999
00:51:58,593 --> 00:52:02,009
-Ding-ding-ding!
-Oh, yeah!

1000
00:52:03,946 --> 00:52:05,614
I had my first
profoundly queer moment

1001
00:52:05,644 --> 00:52:06,963
as a kid watching that movie.

1002
00:52:06,993 --> 00:52:08,573
-What?
-Okay.

1003
00:52:08,603 --> 00:52:10,445
When Vera-Ellen starts dancing

1004
00:52:10,475 --> 00:52:14,013
with her legs going from here
to Mars, ooh,

1005
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:17,234
I fell in love instantly.

1006
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:19,715
Wait, so White Christmas
made you gay?

1007
00:52:19,745 --> 00:52:23,632
Absolutely. Only a thousand
other little girls.

1008
00:52:23,662 --> 00:52:26,164
-And boys.
-Mm-hmm.

1009
00:52:29,189 --> 00:52:31,169
To Vera-Ellen.

1010
00:52:33,193 --> 00:52:35,347
-To Ms. V.
-Mm!

1011
00:52:37,066 --> 00:52:41,998
Oh! Oh, I can't remember the
last time I felt this relaxed.

1012
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:43,921
Yeah, my cooking has that effect
on people.

1013
00:52:46,511 --> 00:52:49,266
Marie trusted you
with the keys, wow!

1014
00:52:49,296 --> 00:52:52,617
What? You thought
I was gonna burn the place down?

1015
00:52:52,647 --> 00:52:55,229
-Mm.
-

1016
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:57,666
-That's Kris Kringle.
-What?

1017
00:52:57,696 --> 00:52:59,146
No way, how can you tell?

1018
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,416
I'd recognize that hoot
anywhere.

1019
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,681
He's watching down over us.

1020
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:11,035
Uh, right.

1021
00:53:11,362 --> 00:53:12,863
Mm.

1022
00:53:19,239 --> 00:53:22,299
Wow, seems like
the real world missed me.

1023
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:25,911
Uh, can you excuse me
for one second?

1024
00:53:25,941 --> 00:53:27,573
Yes.

1025
00:53:34,863 --> 00:53:37,401
Hey, mom,
I just saw your messages.

1026
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:39,011
Yeah, honey,
just when you get home,

1027
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:40,274
maybe we could talk
for a minute.

1028
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:42,893
Yeah. What's up? Talk to me.

1029
00:53:43,872 --> 00:53:47,846
- Yes?

1030
00:53:47,876 --> 00:53:49,761
Hey, where you been? I've been
trying to get a hold of you.

1031
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:52,242
-Slow down, Rohan.
-The title report came back.

1032
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:54,288
Their deed
is in the parents' names.

1033
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:56,377
We don't need Alma to sign off
on cutting down the tree.

1034
00:53:56,407 --> 00:53:59,510
Well, the consultant's report
came back.

1035
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,947
And they-they do wanna get rid
of the catalogue.

1036
00:54:01,977 --> 00:54:03,601
I thought
we already talked about this.

1037
00:54:03,631 --> 00:54:04,950
There's more.

1038
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,909
This is great news.

1039
00:54:06,939 --> 00:54:08,171
We can close the deal
without her.

1040
00:54:08,201 --> 00:54:10,129
You should let her down easy.

1041
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:12,001
-And I'll get the paperwork re--
-Wait a minute, Rohan.

1042
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:14,569
They wanna consolidate
operations to save money.

1043
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:17,702
-In, um, in Arizona.
-What?

1044
00:54:17,732 --> 00:54:21,358
-Hey, come on, Charlie.
-Just, uh, I'll call you back.

1045
00:54:21,388 --> 00:54:23,063
Let me call you back.

1046
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,646
Is everything okay?

1047
00:54:42,191 --> 00:54:45,912
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.
Yeah, I think so.

1048
00:54:48,328 --> 00:54:50,779
What about you?

1049
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:54,094
It's great. It's wonderful.

1050
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:16,848
Oh, honey.

1051
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:20,156
I didn't mean to call you away
from your, um,

1052
00:55:20,186 --> 00:55:22,463
meeting with Charlie.

1053
00:55:22,493 --> 00:55:25,683
It's fine, mom.
This is important.

1054
00:55:25,713 --> 00:55:28,207
Look, it's not that I have
anything against Arizona.

1055
00:55:28,237 --> 00:55:31,341
It's just I don't see us
moving our warehouse there.

1056
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:35,432
Camden is our home. Company logo
is growing in the backyard.

1057
00:55:35,462 --> 00:55:38,696
I mean, how am I supposed to go
between here and Arizona

1058
00:55:38,726 --> 00:55:41,482
to oversee the warehouse while
also doing catalogue sales?

1059
00:55:41,512 --> 00:55:46,313
Well, eventually they'd like to
move all operations to Phoenix.

1060
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:51,187
I mean, this is the bottom line
according to this projection.

1061
00:55:51,217 --> 00:55:53,407
If we don't do
some radical restructuring

1062
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:56,540
within the next five years,
we either get bought out

1063
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:58,673
or we get driven
out of business.

1064
00:55:58,703 --> 00:56:00,631
We're gonna need to make
some big decisions

1065
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:03,199
and we're gonna have to do it
before January.

1066
00:56:03,229 --> 00:56:05,288
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1067
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:07,072
Now, come on,
it's almost midnight.

1068
00:56:07,102 --> 00:56:10,075
Let's, uh, let's get some sleep

1069
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:11,903
and we'll come back to it
tomorrow, all right?

1070
00:56:11,933 --> 00:56:13,601
Goodnight.

1071
00:56:13,631 --> 00:56:15,864
-My two lovelies.
-Oh.

1072
00:56:15,894 --> 00:56:19,876
Big day tomorrow. Workers coming
in to set up the tree lighting.

1073
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:24,307
-This looks beautiful, Marie.
-Thank you.

1074
00:56:24,337 --> 00:56:27,223
You know what they say, "You can
never have too much Christmas."

1075
00:56:27,253 --> 00:56:29,660
Ah! So how did it go last night?

1076
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:34,404
Eh, it was good. We had
some surprises along the way.

1077
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:35,579
It got a little confusing
afterwards.

1078
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:38,408
-Oh, will you tell me later?
-Marie.

1079
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:40,236
What am I gonna do
when we go back to Augusta

1080
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:41,846
and I can't start my day here?

1081
00:56:41,876 --> 00:56:43,761
You are such a sweetheart,
Rohan.

1082
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:45,110
You know, I have to get inside
'cause I've got

1083
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:48,070
some dough proofing.

1084
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,506
So you hear from the office
this morning?

1085
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:51,682
Yup, Sonal wants
the new contracts on her desk,

1086
00:56:51,712 --> 00:56:53,075
so I gotta buy us
some more time.

1087
00:56:53,105 --> 00:56:54,772
I called Baxter State Park,

1088
00:56:54,802 --> 00:56:56,426
they've got
lots of specimen trees.

1089
00:56:56,456 --> 00:56:57,732
Let's just head over there
right now.

1090
00:56:57,762 --> 00:56:59,690
I'm not ready to move on, Rohan.

1091
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,475
If we don't find a tree
in the next 48 hours,

1092
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:04,521
this whole thing is going
to blow up in our faces.

1093
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:06,088
Do you have a new copy
of the contract

1094
00:57:06,118 --> 00:57:08,359
with the parents'
signature line?

1095
00:57:12,254 --> 00:57:14,104
What are you gonna do?

1096
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:21,146
Oh, this is quite a production.

1097
00:57:21,176 --> 00:57:22,757
I've been hanging
some of these same ornaments

1098
00:57:22,787 --> 00:57:26,891
since I was a kid.
Always a trip down memory lane.

1099
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:29,285
There's something I wanna talk
to you and your parents about.

1100
00:57:29,315 --> 00:57:30,939
Yeah, sure, I think
mom and dad are free

1101
00:57:30,969 --> 00:57:32,636
in, like, five minutes. Oh!

1102
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:34,159
I've been meaning to invite
you and Rohan

1103
00:57:34,189 --> 00:57:35,639
to our employee Christmas party
tonight.

1104
00:57:35,669 --> 00:57:38,476
-It's always super fun.
-Thank you.

1105
00:57:40,021 --> 00:57:41,645
We are ready
to start hanging lights, Alma.

1106
00:57:41,675 --> 00:57:43,394
Oh, thank you.

1107
00:57:45,636 --> 00:57:48,217
-I have an idea.
-For what?

1108
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:51,481
-Hey, Tad, can you give us five?
-Five minutes. That's it.

1109
00:57:51,511 --> 00:57:54,049
Thank you.

1110
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,444
You know, I've never seen your
tree-whisperer skills in action.

1111
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,324
-What do you say?
-Absolutely.

1112
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,849
Your carriage awaits.

1113
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:07,323
Oh.

1114
00:58:07,353 --> 00:58:09,717
So, you and this tree
go way back.

1115
00:58:09,747 --> 00:58:11,414
Well, all the way back.

1116
00:58:11,444 --> 00:58:13,460
My great-great-grandparents
planted that tree

1117
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,200
the day
they started the company.

1118
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:17,986
Dad proposed to mom
underneath it.

1119
00:58:18,016 --> 00:58:19,770
I had my first kiss
right over there

1120
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,816
in the middle of a snow storm
on Christmas Eve.

1121
00:58:21,846 --> 00:58:24,296
I'll never forget it.

1122
00:58:24,326 --> 00:58:27,604
-Can I cinch you in?
-Yes, please.

1123
00:58:27,634 --> 00:58:30,180
Nothing like a good harness
to start your day.

1124
00:58:31,638 --> 00:58:34,176
-Tighter?
-Yes, as tight as you can get.

1125
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:35,881
Mm-hmm.

1126
00:58:37,209 --> 00:58:39,834
Now I know why you like your job
so much.

1127
00:58:39,864 --> 00:58:41,365
Okay.

1128
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,841
Aren't we taking an operator?

1129
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:48,807
You're lookin' at her.

1130
00:58:52,746 --> 00:58:55,205
All right. Here we go.

1131
00:58:59,231 --> 00:59:02,473
-Safety first.
-Thank you.

1132
00:59:04,192 --> 00:59:06,738
-Ready?
-Ready.

1133
00:59:26,954 --> 00:59:28,883
Can we stop here?

1134
00:59:28,913 --> 00:59:31,842
This is where I look for what
separates a good Christmas tree

1135
00:59:31,872 --> 00:59:34,149
from a great Christmas tree.

1136
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:36,194
There are so many factors
that come into play

1137
00:59:36,224 --> 00:59:38,675
beyond aesthetics,
like how difficult it's gonna be

1138
00:59:38,705 --> 00:59:41,983
to cut and haul off-site,
what are the hydration levels.

1139
00:59:42,013 --> 00:59:44,420
But if you listen closely,

1140
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:47,075
you can figure out
a tree's history.

1141
00:59:47,105 --> 00:59:48,780
How so?

1142
00:59:49,977 --> 00:59:52,863
-Look. See the discoloration?
-Mm.

1143
00:59:52,893 --> 00:59:55,562
-Signs of CSNN.
-What's that?

1144
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:59,391
It's current season
needle necrosis.

1145
00:59:59,421 --> 01:00:01,829
This tree has fought drought
conditions for a long time.

1146
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:06,137
Yeah, we had a really bad one
a couple of years ago. Huh.

1147
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:08,183
Over there, see that scarring?

1148
01:00:08,213 --> 01:00:11,882
-This tree was hit by lightning.
-When I was 12.

1149
01:00:11,912 --> 01:00:13,710
The boom was so loud,
it cracked my bedroom window.

1150
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,234
I thought
we'd lost her for sure.

1151
01:00:16,264 --> 01:00:19,498
Wow, this is
a really special tree.

1152
01:00:19,528 --> 01:00:23,851
-Oh, she's the mother tree.
-What's that?

1153
01:00:23,881 --> 01:00:26,941
She shelters all the trees
around her.

1154
01:00:26,971 --> 01:00:28,986
But someday when she moves on,

1155
01:00:29,016 --> 01:00:30,553
she's gonna allow in
enough sunlight

1156
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:33,164
to nourish all the saplings.

1157
01:00:33,194 --> 01:00:35,000
It's beautiful.

1158
01:00:36,763 --> 01:00:39,780
I still don't get how
you do this, it's like magic.

1159
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:42,913
Call it reading a tree. I do it
with everything in life.

1160
01:00:42,943 --> 01:00:44,654
My father taught me.

1161
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:48,527
Sometime a tree can look
incredible from a flyover,

1162
01:00:48,557 --> 01:00:49,964
but you don't really know
what you're looking at

1163
01:00:49,994 --> 01:00:51,792
until you're up close.

1164
01:00:51,822 --> 01:00:54,098
Maybe it's not
such a perfect fit.

1165
01:00:54,128 --> 01:00:56,535
Or maybe it's the one

1166
01:00:56,565 --> 01:00:58,763
that you've been looking for
you entire life.

1167
01:01:05,574 --> 01:01:07,459
Alma!

1168
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:10,862
-Your five minutes is up.
-Okay, Tad, we'll be right down.

1169
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:14,336
Do we have to?

1170
01:01:14,366 --> 01:01:16,868
Our carriage
is about to turn into a pumpkin.

1171
01:01:17,195 --> 01:01:19,044
Yeah.

1172
01:01:21,068 --> 01:01:22,874
Thank you, Tad.

1173
01:01:23,462 --> 01:01:25,956
Oh, that was amazing.

1174
01:01:25,986 --> 01:01:28,002
Oh, you wanted to talk to mom
and dad about something, right?

1175
01:01:28,032 --> 01:01:29,438
-I can go grab them.
-Uh, you know what?

1176
01:01:29,468 --> 01:01:32,571
It's, it's nothing.
It's nothing at all.

1177
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:35,270
Do you think your mom has any
more of that glogg left?

1178
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,194
-I could use a drink.
-Okay, let's go.

1179
01:01:50,228 --> 01:01:52,425
Yeah, these are my favorite...

1180
01:01:54,841 --> 01:01:57,031
-God, this is unreal!
-See...

1181
01:01:57,061 --> 01:01:58,336
I don't understand
why the governor

1182
01:01:58,366 --> 01:01:59,947
doesn't throws parties
like this.

1183
01:01:59,977 --> 01:02:02,253
There's always
some boring old string quartet.

1184
01:02:02,283 --> 01:02:05,300
Hey, I'm so glad
you guys made it. Hi.

1185
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:06,910
Oh, my God, Alma,
this is incredible!

1186
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:10,400
Here, pick a card.
I wanna see what you are.

1187
01:02:12,772 --> 01:02:15,963
Naughty.
No, naughty is the new nice.

1188
01:02:15,993 --> 01:02:17,355
Okay, Rohan,
let's see how you fair.

1189
01:02:17,385 --> 01:02:18,930
Okay.

1190
01:02:21,215 --> 01:02:24,711
I don't know, it says naughty.
Doesn't really sound like me.

1191
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,539
I knew it. Here you go.

1192
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:29,628
Hey, you want to check out
the food?

1193
01:02:29,658 --> 01:02:32,596
I hear some genius baker
made all the desserts.

1194
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,598
Let's go.

1195
01:02:37,405 --> 01:02:41,031
Think she forgot
something mandatory.

1196
01:02:41,061 --> 01:02:42,859
Right. Uh...

1197
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:45,130
Does it bring out my eyes?

1198
01:02:48,373 --> 01:02:50,135
Check it out.

1199
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:53,957
Oh, my God!
Your parents are rockstars!

1200
01:02:53,987 --> 01:02:56,220
They alternate sets
every 30 minutes.

1201
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:59,702
Dad's rediscovering his musical
roots, all thanks to you.

1202
01:02:59,732 --> 01:03:02,800
Oh, well,
you're welcome for that.

1203
01:03:03,431 --> 01:03:05,237
Come on.

1204
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:21,724
Welcome.
Oh, I am Mrs. Maggie Claus.

1205
01:03:21,754 --> 01:03:23,552
What do we have here?

1206
01:03:23,582 --> 01:03:26,511
Two beautiful women
looking for their futures.

1207
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:29,079
Let Maggie light the way.

1208
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:31,255
-Who goes first?
-Charlie.

1209
01:03:31,285 --> 01:03:32,743
Okay.

1210
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:39,750
Mm...

1211
01:03:44,255 --> 01:03:47,054
Four calling birds. Oh.

1212
01:03:47,084 --> 01:03:49,056
Um, she's talking about
the chickens.

1213
01:03:49,086 --> 01:03:50,927
The chickens? No.

1214
01:03:50,957 --> 01:03:55,062
Birds that travel
great distance, that is you.

1215
01:03:55,092 --> 01:03:57,028
What kind of bird am I?

1216
01:03:58,312 --> 01:04:00,031
Falcon.

1217
01:04:00,314 --> 01:04:02,156
An eagle.

1218
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:04,811
-Oh, maybe an owl.
-An owl?

1219
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,988
Okay, well, only one question
per reading. Next.

1220
01:04:08,018 --> 01:04:09,519
Uh...

1221
01:04:11,499 --> 01:04:13,044
Mm...

1222
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:17,780
A partridge in a pear tree.

1223
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,869
-Mm, we're birds.
-Oh, no.

1224
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:23,003
You are the pear tree,
not the partridge.

1225
01:04:23,033 --> 01:04:25,919
You provide a home
for the birds.

1226
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:30,358
Oh, may you all live together
in harmony.

1227
01:04:30,388 --> 01:04:32,099
-What does that mean?
-The heck if I know.

1228
01:04:32,129 --> 01:04:34,152
I'm just the messenger.

1229
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,851
Next.

1230
01:04:41,529 --> 01:04:43,640
-Uh-oh.

1231
01:04:45,098 --> 01:04:47,201
Hey, mom, how you doin'?

1232
01:04:47,231 --> 01:04:48,724
Rohan, I've been trying to reach

1233
01:04:48,754 --> 01:04:50,682
Charlotte,
I keep leaving messages.

1234
01:04:50,712 --> 01:04:52,467
Does she have her phone
turned off?

1235
01:04:52,497 --> 01:04:55,949
I don't know, but I can find her
for you, if you want.

1236
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:58,821
No, actually,
I'd rather talk to you.

1237
01:04:58,851 --> 01:05:00,083
Why haven't you been
calling me back?

1238
01:05:00,113 --> 01:05:01,302
Oh, well, you know,
I've just been,

1239
01:05:01,332 --> 01:05:04,479
um, really swamped around here.

1240
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:06,829
Okay, so where is Charlotte
with the contracts?

1241
01:05:06,859 --> 01:05:08,570
-Technically--
-Technically...

1242
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,398
Doesn't get the tree here
by Tuesday.

1243
01:05:10,428 --> 01:05:12,400
It's the daughter, Alma,
that's the holdup.

1244
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:14,184
I mean, I keep telling Charlie,
we don't actually need her.

1245
01:05:14,214 --> 01:05:17,108
Her name's not on the title. Ah!

1246
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,671
You know what, why don't
I get Charlie to call--

1247
01:05:22,701 --> 01:05:25,979
No, no, it's okay.
I got what I needed.

1248
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:28,119
-I'll see you soon.
-Okay, love you.

1249
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:31,201
You havin' a good time?

1250
01:05:31,231 --> 01:05:33,595
I thought so.

1251
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:36,903
We're here to celebrate
our retirement.

1252
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,600
Yeah!
-

1253
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:40,210
Stop it, stop it.

1254
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,256
We're here to celebrate
Christmas

1255
01:05:42,286 --> 01:05:45,824
and we're here to celebrate you,
our valued team.

1256
01:05:45,854 --> 01:05:48,871
Isabelle and I, how do we even
start to thank you?

1257
01:05:48,901 --> 01:05:51,787
And, uh, to also introduce
your new boss,

1258
01:05:51,817 --> 01:05:55,617
our lovely little daughter,
Alma.

1259
01:05:55,647 --> 01:05:59,577
I'd like to sing a song.
It's been a while.

1260
01:05:59,607 --> 01:06:02,058
I used to sing this song
to the two

1261
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:04,495
beautiful women in my life
every Christmas.

1262
01:06:04,525 --> 01:06:08,630
And, um, thanks to a new friend,
who with a little prodding,

1263
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:11,162
little encouragement,
brought me back to it.

1264
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:15,645
-Here goes.
-

1265
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:30,137
be forgot

1266
01:06:35,034 --> 01:06:39,451
be forgot

1267
01:06:53,357 --> 01:06:57,817
a cup of kindness yet

1268
01:07:04,585 --> 01:07:07,167
You know, this wouldn't be
happening if it wasn't for you.

1269
01:07:07,197 --> 01:07:08,864
-Well...
-I'm really glad you're here.

1270
01:07:08,894 --> 01:07:10,526
Charlie.

1271
01:07:12,811 --> 01:07:15,879
I hate that you're going back
to Augusta in a few days.

1272
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:22,878
You know, I never thought
I'd say this,

1273
01:07:22,908 --> 01:07:26,838
but I'm tired
of livin' out of a suitcase.

1274
01:07:26,868 --> 01:07:30,277
I thought you liked your
freedom. Every day's a new day.

1275
01:07:30,307 --> 01:07:34,498
I did. I do. I used to.

1276
01:07:34,528 --> 01:07:38,162
-Since when.
-Since meeting you.

1277
01:07:40,795 --> 01:07:43,907
I'm about to go between
here and Phoenix next year.

1278
01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:49,774
You know,
I had a girlfriend in Paris.

1279
01:07:49,804 --> 01:07:51,472
When I came home,
we tried to make the whole

1280
01:07:51,502 --> 01:07:55,693
long-distance thing work,
but it didn't.

1281
01:07:55,723 --> 01:07:57,442
Hm.

1282
01:07:58,726 --> 01:08:00,924
So where does that leave us?

1283
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,362
I don't know.

1284
01:08:05,777 --> 01:08:07,757
Right.

1285
01:08:13,872 --> 01:08:15,765
Thank you.

1286
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:27,029
Good morning. Oh, I didn't know
we were havin' a board meeting.

1287
01:08:27,059 --> 01:08:30,475
-Let me go wake up your mother.
-No, no, just let her sleep.

1288
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:34,087
Honey, I'm worried about you.

1289
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:38,997
Got a lot on my plate,
I can't lie.

1290
01:08:39,027 --> 01:08:42,523
Yeah, yeah, and life will keep
throwing you curve balls.

1291
01:08:42,553 --> 01:08:45,352
Faster than I can hit 'em.

1292
01:08:45,382 --> 01:08:47,963
You know, when I was your age,
my parents asked me

1293
01:08:47,993 --> 01:08:51,967
to take over the company, but I
was planning a career in music.

1294
01:08:51,997 --> 01:08:54,230
What?

1295
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:56,624
I didn't know that. I thought
that was just a hobby.

1296
01:08:56,654 --> 01:09:00,410
Well, I mean,
I figured I'd work for my dad,

1297
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,020
your grandfather,
for a couple of years

1298
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:04,806
and then go off
and do my music full-time.

1299
01:09:04,836 --> 01:09:05,981
What?

1300
01:09:06,011 --> 01:09:08,157
But then I, uh, I met your mom

1301
01:09:08,187 --> 01:09:10,899
and we started dating.

1302
01:09:10,929 --> 01:09:13,597
And, um, then there was
no reason to leave.

1303
01:09:13,627 --> 01:09:17,035
There were only reasons to stay.
I mean...

1304
01:09:17,065 --> 01:09:20,474
-Do you have any regrets?
-No.

1305
01:09:20,504 --> 01:09:23,781
No, so many wonderful things
happened, like you.

1306
01:09:23,811 --> 01:09:26,828
But this is the beginning
of your journey.

1307
01:09:26,858 --> 01:09:29,665
I mean, who-who knows
where it'll lead you.

1308
01:09:31,732 --> 01:09:34,270
I feel like I'm failing already.

1309
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,185
I don't wanna disappoint
you and mom.

1310
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:39,667
You're kidding me?
That'll never happen.

1311
01:09:39,697 --> 01:09:41,408
Just feel like
I always make safe choices,

1312
01:09:41,438 --> 01:09:44,933
and I, I can't do that anymore.

1313
01:09:44,963 --> 01:09:48,980
Whatever you decide, we will
support you. You understand?

1314
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:50,816
Come on, come here.

1315
01:09:51,317 --> 01:09:54,690
Hey. Oh...

1316
01:09:57,671 --> 01:09:59,216
Mm.

1317
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:03,952
What about
this Douglass fir on the right?

1318
01:10:03,982 --> 01:10:07,869
Coordinates, 21.37 by 80.6.

1319
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:09,479
That's a beautiful tree.

1320
01:10:09,509 --> 01:10:12,838
Stately,
probably a 150 years old.

1321
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,665
It's problematic base.
Not feelin' it.

1322
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:25,495
We've been here for two hours
and you're not feeling anything.

1323
01:10:25,525 --> 01:10:29,369
-We can make this tree work.
-No. The tree will find us.

1324
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:31,074
Let's keep looking.

1325
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:37,899
I told the consultant
your feelings about

1326
01:10:37,929 --> 01:10:40,641
keeping the catalogue, and they
sent this link this morning.

1327
01:10:40,671 --> 01:10:42,425
I-I know
that they're just trying

1328
01:10:42,455 --> 01:10:44,122
to work with us. I'm not trying
to be impossible.

1329
01:10:44,152 --> 01:10:47,125
No, no, their creative team
just did a quick mockup.

1330
01:10:47,155 --> 01:10:49,954
They thought it might be helpful
to see what it would be like

1331
01:10:49,984 --> 01:10:51,782
if we did decide
to go fully digital.

1332
01:10:51,812 --> 01:10:54,785
Wow.
-Yeah.

1333
01:10:54,815 --> 01:10:57,484
I mean, it's beautiful, but...

1334
01:10:57,514 --> 01:10:59,964
-It's not really us.
-No?

1335
01:10:59,994 --> 01:11:03,054
What happened to the recipes,
the-the family photos,

1336
01:11:03,084 --> 01:11:04,578
the chicken coop
from the back page?

1337
01:11:04,608 --> 01:11:06,362
Uh-huh, well, I think
they wanted to feature

1338
01:11:06,392 --> 01:11:09,634
more of our product line,
which seems...

1339
01:11:12,877 --> 01:11:16,067
I think we need to consider
some of their recommendations--

1340
01:11:16,097 --> 01:11:18,418
I know,
but this is so soulless, mom.

1341
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:20,071
What happened
to the joy of Christmas?

1342
01:11:20,101 --> 01:11:22,683
There won't be the joy
of celebrating anything

1343
01:11:22,713 --> 01:11:24,554
if we go out of business.

1344
01:11:24,584 --> 01:11:28,036
Wow, I can't believe
we're disagreeing on this.

1345
01:11:28,066 --> 01:11:32,301
Part of your job now as CEO,
a big part of your job,

1346
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:35,217
is going to be
considering all the options,

1347
01:11:35,247 --> 01:11:38,089
no matter
how unpleasant they may be.

1348
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:40,056
Ugh.

1349
01:11:41,122 --> 01:11:44,879
Look, we can postpone
our retirement.

1350
01:11:44,909 --> 01:11:46,576
-No...
-If you think that would help.

1351
01:11:46,606 --> 01:11:49,971
Mom, I don't need you
to do that.

1352
01:11:50,001 --> 01:11:53,896
All right, then,
we're gonna get through this.

1353
01:11:59,271 --> 01:12:02,766
We're gonna need the strongest,
blackest coffee you've got.

1354
01:12:02,796 --> 01:12:05,508
I should probably check in
with Sonal.

1355
01:12:05,538 --> 01:12:07,858
No need. I'm right here.

1356
01:12:07,888 --> 01:12:09,207
-Ma?
-Sonal?

1357
01:12:09,237 --> 01:12:10,905
A lovely young woman at the BnB

1358
01:12:10,935 --> 01:12:12,915
said I could find you here.

1359
01:12:14,373 --> 01:12:16,440
We need to talk.

1360
01:12:17,507 --> 01:12:19,740
I didn't see an 18-wheeler
parked out front

1361
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:21,132
with my Christmas tree.

1362
01:12:21,162 --> 01:12:23,178
-Let me explain.
-You do remember...

1363
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:24,919
The governor is up
for re-election next year.

1364
01:12:24,949 --> 01:12:26,442
We're gettin' close, Sonal.

1365
01:12:26,472 --> 01:12:27,835
You should've seen
some of the candidates

1366
01:12:27,865 --> 01:12:30,098
this morning.

1367
01:12:30,128 --> 01:12:32,143
W-what happened
to the Beltran tree?

1368
01:12:32,173 --> 01:12:34,189
It's not available.

1369
01:12:34,219 --> 01:12:35,669
That's never been a problem
before.

1370
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:36,974
Charlie's doing
everything she can.

1371
01:12:37,004 --> 01:12:38,541
That's not the report
I wanna take back

1372
01:12:38,571 --> 01:12:40,978
to the governor.
I'm disappointed in you two.

1373
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:43,416
If you don't need he daughter's
signature, just get on with it.

1374
01:12:43,446 --> 01:12:46,375
What? How do you know
we don't need the--

1375
01:12:46,405 --> 01:12:49,596
Uh, my mother called me
the other night

1376
01:12:49,626 --> 01:12:51,772
during the party. I'm sorry.

1377
01:12:51,802 --> 01:12:54,905
You pitched me the most
beautiful tree you've ever seen.

1378
01:12:54,935 --> 01:12:56,733
And now that's all
the governor can talk about.

1379
01:12:56,763 --> 01:12:58,779
Why can't you just get them
to sign this?

1380
01:12:58,809 --> 01:13:00,607
It's complicated.

1381
01:13:00,637 --> 01:13:02,913
Whatever you've been doing
to cozy up to this family

1382
01:13:02,943 --> 01:13:04,654
clearly isn't working.

1383
01:13:04,684 --> 01:13:06,917
Whatever happened
to that charm offensive?

1384
01:13:06,947 --> 01:13:08,615
If the parents said they're fine
with you taking the tree,

1385
01:13:08,645 --> 01:13:11,364
just forget about the daughter.

1386
01:13:12,257 --> 01:13:14,316
Okay.

1387
01:13:14,346 --> 01:13:17,066
-Alma?
-What's goin' on?

1388
01:13:20,265 --> 01:13:23,412
-Hi. I'm Alma Beltran.
-Hi.

1389
01:13:23,442 --> 01:13:25,980
I'm Charlotte's boss, Sonal.
It's nice to meet you, Alma.

1390
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:28,809
I'm just here to secure
the contract for your tree.

1391
01:13:28,839 --> 01:13:31,377
Oh, our tree isn't going
anywhere. Charlie knows that.

1392
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:34,118
Oh, I appreciate that it means
the world to your family,

1393
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:36,904
which is why Charlie fell in
love with it in the first place.

1394
01:13:36,934 --> 01:13:38,775
That's why she's been trying
so hard to get you--

1395
01:13:38,805 --> 01:13:41,952
We haven't changed our minds.

1396
01:13:41,982 --> 01:13:45,869
Uh, you do realize,
with your parents onboard,

1397
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:48,176
we don't need you.

1398
01:13:48,206 --> 01:13:50,091
Excuse me?

1399
01:13:50,121 --> 01:13:51,927
Tell her, Charlotte.

1400
01:13:54,168 --> 01:13:55,488
-What Sonal's trying to say--
-No, no, no.

1401
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:58,020
I'm not trying to say anything.

1402
01:13:58,999 --> 01:14:01,066
Be straight with her.

1403
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:05,106
Legally we just need
your parents' signature

1404
01:14:05,136 --> 01:14:07,151
on the contracts.

1405
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:09,589
But I'm gonna find another tree.

1406
01:14:09,619 --> 01:14:11,504
I'm done.

1407
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:13,383
-Alma.

1408
01:14:22,893 --> 01:14:24,691
To keep you warm
when you're out there.

1409
01:14:24,721 --> 01:14:27,998
Thank you.
Rohan's gonna be thrilled.

1410
01:14:28,028 --> 01:14:29,826
What am I gonna do,
Marie?

1411
01:14:29,856 --> 01:14:31,654
That's a tough one,
Charlie.

1412
01:14:31,684 --> 01:14:32,873
God, I've made such a mess of

1413
01:14:32,903 --> 01:14:35,702
everything.
Maybe I should just go.

1414
01:14:35,732 --> 01:14:38,095
There's nothing wrong
with floating through life,

1415
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:40,402
but at the end of the day
you want to be rooted

1416
01:14:40,432 --> 01:14:42,839
and connected to someone
or something.

1417
01:14:42,869 --> 01:14:46,016
I want that. I just,
I don't know how to get there.

1418
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:49,150
You will. The pathway
is out there for all of us.

1419
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:52,675
-The trick is finding it.
-

1420
01:14:52,705 --> 01:14:55,243
Okay. I got the drone
all loaded.

1421
01:14:55,273 --> 01:14:57,506
-Good luck.
-Today's the day.

1422
01:14:57,536 --> 01:15:00,473
-I can feel it in my bones.
-

1423
01:15:12,682 --> 01:15:14,828
-It sounds like Kris.
- All the way over here?

1424
01:15:14,858 --> 01:15:16,786
Yeah, I re-homed him
just across the ridge.

1425
01:15:16,816 --> 01:15:19,180
Aren't owls nocturnal? What's
he doing hooting during the day?

1426
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:22,365
He's trying
to tell us something.

1427
01:15:38,403 --> 01:15:39,904
Yeah.

1428
01:15:54,288 --> 01:15:57,305
Now this is a grand old dame!

1429
01:15:57,335 --> 01:16:00,656
So regal! Look how she stands
like a dancer.

1430
01:16:00,686 --> 01:16:03,180
Beautiful crown
on a tall proud base.

1431
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:07,402
Excellent. Yeah, you're getting
the lingo down, Rohan.

1432
01:16:07,432 --> 01:16:09,273
This Douglas fir is nearing
the end of her life.

1433
01:16:09,303 --> 01:16:11,275
I think she'd be honored
to have thousands of people

1434
01:16:11,305 --> 01:16:15,200
visiting her for Christmas.
I think we've found our tree.

1435
01:16:16,441 --> 01:16:18,203
Thank you, Kris!

1436
01:16:31,151 --> 01:16:33,950
-Hey.
-Hey.

1437
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:37,345
Hope you don't mind.
Your dad said you were out here.

1438
01:16:37,375 --> 01:16:39,746
Why are you here, Charlie?

1439
01:16:41,509 --> 01:16:43,924
Rohan and I are leaving
first thing in the morning.

1440
01:16:45,122 --> 01:16:48,617
-Have a safe trip.
-Wait.

1441
01:16:48,647 --> 01:16:51,054
I wanted to say
more than goodbye.

1442
01:16:51,084 --> 01:16:53,804
Just hear me out,
then I'll go, I promise.

1443
01:16:56,394 --> 01:16:58,888
-What happened with my boss--
-I can't believe you lied to me.

1444
01:16:58,918 --> 01:17:01,499
I didn't. I-I could have moved
on without you, but I didn't.

1445
01:17:01,529 --> 01:17:03,589
Really, 'cause it looked like
you were just using me

1446
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,113
to get what you wanted.
I mean, she even said as much.

1447
01:17:06,143 --> 01:17:08,427
Your charm offensive?

1448
01:17:10,582 --> 01:17:14,469
I found a wonderful tree
at the reforestation project.

1449
01:17:14,499 --> 01:17:15,905
It will be cut down tomorrow.

1450
01:17:15,935 --> 01:17:17,690
I'm gonna build
an entire educational platform

1451
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,518
around what they're doing
over there.

1452
01:17:20,548 --> 01:17:22,659
Maybe it'll help
with their funding.

1453
01:17:23,464 --> 01:17:25,001
That's really great.

1454
01:17:25,031 --> 01:17:27,577
It wouldn't have happened
without you.

1455
01:17:31,037 --> 01:17:35,237
You know, each of us
in our own way is a whisperer.

1456
01:17:36,129 --> 01:17:38,362
For me it's trees.

1457
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:40,242
For you it's Christmas.

1458
01:17:43,484 --> 01:17:46,327
I am not so sure about that
anymore.

1459
01:17:46,357 --> 01:17:50,113
Come on, you are the true Camden
Christmas Shoppe whisperer

1460
01:17:50,143 --> 01:17:52,420
if there ever was one.

1461
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:54,952
Who else eats eggnog ice cream
in July?

1462
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:01,255
You know, you don't need
some consultant

1463
01:18:01,285 --> 01:18:03,134
telling you what to do.

1464
01:18:04,114 --> 01:18:05,919
You already have
all the answers.

1465
01:18:08,988 --> 01:18:11,447
Everything I said to you
was real.

1466
01:18:12,949 --> 01:18:15,755
I really wanna believe you.

1467
01:18:17,518 --> 01:18:19,281
So it's goodbye, then?

1468
01:18:22,088 --> 01:18:24,199
Whatever this was was...

1469
01:18:26,005 --> 01:18:28,246
wonderful.

1470
01:18:32,185 --> 01:18:33,904
But it's over now.

1471
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,432
Goodbye, Charlie.

1472
01:18:42,065 --> 01:18:44,436
Okay.

1473
01:18:47,505 --> 01:18:53,053
a cup of kindness yet

1474
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:04,144
If all goes to plan, we'll be
in Augusta and unloaded by 3:00.

1475
01:19:04,174 --> 01:19:08,278
-Are we checked out?
-Yup. We are ready to go.

1476
01:19:08,308 --> 01:19:12,108
Hey, I'm sorry
about the call with my mom.

1477
01:19:12,138 --> 01:19:15,198
She gets to talking, and I just
don't know when to shut up.

1478
01:19:15,228 --> 01:19:18,071
No. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
put you in the middle.

1479
01:19:18,101 --> 01:19:21,074
Hey, I got to learn how
to stand up to her for myself.

1480
01:19:21,104 --> 01:19:23,258
That is between her and me.

1481
01:19:24,368 --> 01:19:26,609
I'm gonna go
finish loading the SUV.

1482
01:19:30,156 --> 01:19:33,260
For the road.
Something to remember me by.

1483
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:36,742
Ah. I'm never gonna forget
this trip, Marie.

1484
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:39,048
And I'm never gonna forget
the guy who was willing to carry

1485
01:19:39,078 --> 01:19:42,835
his sourdough starter
all over Maine.

1486
01:19:42,865 --> 01:19:45,054
You know, I'm gonna be opening
up that shop in Portland.

1487
01:19:45,084 --> 01:19:47,970
I'm gonna be needing
an apprentice.

1488
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,363
Stay in touch, Rohan.

1489
01:19:49,393 --> 01:19:52,504
You... butter believe it.

1490
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:00,548
Oh, hey!

1491
01:20:00,578 --> 01:20:03,812
This arrived for you
early this morning.

1492
01:20:03,842 --> 01:20:05,996
Are they giving me
the keys to the city?

1493
01:20:30,477 --> 01:20:32,667
Hm.

1494
01:20:32,697 --> 01:20:35,757
You take good care of her,
Marie.

1495
01:20:35,787 --> 01:20:39,065
She's lucky to have
a friend like you.

1496
01:20:39,095 --> 01:20:43,033
There's always a table
for you here, Charlie.

1497
01:20:57,504 --> 01:20:59,049
Bye.

1498
01:21:04,947 --> 01:21:06,622
-

1499
01:21:09,299 --> 01:21:13,447
Here you go. Enjoy.

1500
01:21:13,477 --> 01:21:16,537
Dad, the s'mores bonfire
was a such a good idea.

1501
01:21:16,567 --> 01:21:18,321
-The kids are loving it.
- They are.

1502
01:21:18,351 --> 01:21:20,933
Yeah.

1503
01:21:20,963 --> 01:21:24,197
Mom, I wanna apologize
for snapping at you yesterday.

1504
01:21:24,227 --> 01:21:26,286
-I was at a breaking point.
- You didn't, honey.

1505
01:21:26,316 --> 01:21:29,855
You've been under
a tremendous amount of pressure.

1506
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,248
Oh, we knew this transition
was gonna be tough.

1507
01:21:32,278 --> 01:21:35,338
It's scary stuff, honey.
Just know that we love you.

1508
01:21:35,368 --> 01:21:37,253
I know, but I want you guys
to be able to go to Florida

1509
01:21:37,283 --> 01:21:39,212
and not have to worry about me.

1510
01:21:39,242 --> 01:21:40,691
Listen, if it makes you feel
any better,

1511
01:21:40,721 --> 01:21:42,911
I'm really anxious
about leaving.

1512
01:21:42,941 --> 01:21:44,608
It's hard letting go.

1513
01:21:44,638 --> 01:21:46,567
I mean, your mom's doing
a great job.

1514
01:21:46,597 --> 01:21:48,961
I mean, we-we both are.
We both are, right?

1515
01:21:48,991 --> 01:21:51,528
I'm letting go
so you have room to grow

1516
01:21:51,558 --> 01:21:54,444
and soak up the sun.

1517
01:21:54,474 --> 01:21:56,359
Like the mother tree.

1518
01:21:56,389 --> 01:21:58,935
Yeah. Like the mother tree.

1519
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:05,847
I've been doing
a lot of thinking,

1520
01:22:05,877 --> 01:22:07,893
and I've made some decisions.

1521
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,511
Oh?

1522
01:22:11,187 --> 01:22:13,115
-I'm done with this consultant.
-What?

1523
01:22:13,145 --> 01:22:15,335
I'm not moving our warehouse.

1524
01:22:15,365 --> 01:22:18,120
Yes, I will hire someone
to do digital outreach,

1525
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:21,558
but the catalog stays.

1526
01:22:21,588 --> 01:22:23,996
Mom, we've been going strong
for a 100 years now,

1527
01:22:24,026 --> 01:22:25,432
and if I follow my instincts,
we'll be in business

1528
01:22:25,462 --> 01:22:27,703
another 100 years from now.

1529
01:22:31,555 --> 01:22:34,354
Mom, what do you think?

1530
01:22:34,384 --> 01:22:37,139
Are you asking me
as the soon-to-be former CEO

1531
01:22:37,169 --> 01:22:38,793
or as your mother?

1532
01:22:38,823 --> 01:22:41,230
Both.

1533
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:46,061
Sweetheart, it's not easy
to blaze your own trail,

1534
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:49,021
but it's the mark
of a true leader.

1535
01:22:49,051 --> 01:22:52,902
And I'm right here with you,
Alma, all the way.

1536
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:57,725
I don't color outside the lines
very often,

1537
01:22:57,755 --> 01:23:00,562
but I think it's time I start
scribbling all over the page.

1538
01:23:01,367 --> 01:23:02,999
Oh, baby.

1539
01:23:09,941 --> 01:23:11,608
-You're beautiful.

1540
01:23:11,638 --> 01:23:14,489
-Oh.
-We did good, Issy.

1541
01:23:15,512 --> 01:23:18,188
-We did good.
-Yeah.

1542
01:23:27,915 --> 01:23:29,800
-All right!
-Whoo! Yeah!

1543
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:32,586
Welcome, welcome, welcome,
everyone! Welcome, welcome!

1544
01:23:32,616 --> 01:23:35,241
I'd like to introduce
my daughter, Alma.

1545
01:23:35,271 --> 01:23:37,330
Come on up, honey,
say a few words. Come on, Alma.

1546
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,201
-Oh. Yeah.
- Come on up.

1547
01:23:39,231 --> 01:23:40,863
Just come on up.

1548
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,511
Stage is yours.
Stage is yours.

1549
01:23:44,541 --> 01:23:47,905
-Thank you, dad.
-Okay.

1550
01:23:47,935 --> 01:23:52,258
Oh, oh, I feel like I know
everyone here by first name,

1551
01:23:52,288 --> 01:23:54,006
and I probably do.

1552
01:23:56,988 --> 01:23:59,221
Tonight we are here
to celebrate everything

1553
01:23:59,251 --> 01:24:02,703
that makes Christmas so special.

1554
01:24:02,733 --> 01:24:06,715
For me that's family, friends...

1555
01:24:08,956 --> 01:24:11,929
and especially this tree.

1556
01:24:11,959 --> 01:24:15,245
She's endured a 100 years
and she's still going strong.

1557
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,240
She's our mother tree.

1558
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:20,112
She whispers her secrets
to those of us

1559
01:24:20,142 --> 01:24:22,984
who are willing to listen.

1560
01:24:23,014 --> 01:24:27,945
And her message this Christmas
is about love,

1561
01:24:27,975 --> 01:24:30,913
always enduring,
through good times and bad.

1562
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:33,568
To another 100 years.

1563
01:24:34,982 --> 01:24:36,745
Merry Christmas.

1564
01:24:39,291 --> 01:24:41,133
Okay.
-Beautiful.

1565
01:24:41,163 --> 01:24:43,091
We know what to sing.
-Beautiful.

1566
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:47,139
o Christmas tree

1567
01:24:47,169 --> 01:24:50,968
are so unchanging

1568
01:24:50,998 --> 01:24:54,276
o Christmas tree

1569
01:24:54,306 --> 01:24:58,593
are so unchanging

1570
01:24:59,442 --> 01:25:01,805
Charlie?

1571
01:25:01,835 --> 01:25:03,329
I thought you went back
to Augusta.

1572
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:06,201
I did. The tree goes up
in the morning.

1573
01:25:06,231 --> 01:25:08,124
The governor was thrilled.

1574
01:25:09,887 --> 01:25:12,555
I feel terrible
that I hurt you, Alma.

1575
01:25:12,585 --> 01:25:14,478
I'm so sorry.

1576
01:25:15,632 --> 01:25:17,691
I was
at the reforestation project,

1577
01:25:17,721 --> 01:25:20,955
and I saw that they were looking
for a new executive director.

1578
01:25:20,985 --> 01:25:22,826
Seriously?

1579
01:25:22,856 --> 01:25:26,134
I mean, they could use
a certified tree whisperer.

1580
01:25:26,164 --> 01:25:30,138
I think there's an opportunity
for me here.

1581
01:25:30,168 --> 01:25:32,801
I was kinda hoping I could ask
the girls for their advice.

1582
01:25:35,826 --> 01:25:38,067
Do you think we can give this
another shot?

1583
01:25:38,959 --> 01:25:41,976
I was hoping you'd say that.

1584
01:25:42,006 --> 01:25:44,900
Let's light the tree!
-Yay! Yay!

1585
01:25:46,053 --> 01:25:47,634
Come on. I want you to join us.

1586
01:25:47,664 --> 01:25:50,993
Really? Nah, it's just family.

1587
01:25:51,494 --> 01:25:53,430
Exactly.

1588
01:25:57,413 --> 01:25:59,646
Come on, Charlie.

1589
01:25:59,676 --> 01:26:01,778
Okay.

1590
01:26:01,808 --> 01:26:05,616
Three, two, one!

1591
01:26:13,864 --> 01:26:15,270
Merry Christmas!

1592
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:16,932
Oh.

1593
01:26:19,870 --> 01:26:21,407
Merry Christmas, Alma.

1594
01:26:21,437 --> 01:26:23,547
Merry Christmas, Charlie.
