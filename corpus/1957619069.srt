- Shit.

189
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,550
He's a God damn lieutenant.

190
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,383
- He was trying to kill me.

191
00:17:12,383 --> 00:17:14,923
- Did I say you could
move you son of a bitch?

192
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,273
- [Male Cop] I'm gonna go call it in.

193
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:20,356
(sirens)

194
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,843
- Doyle's here.

195
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:25,676
- [Female Cop] Yeah I heard about him,

196
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:28,130
he's the new captain
transferred in from 77 right?

197
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,330
- [Male Cop] That's him.

198
00:17:30,824 --> 00:17:32,991
(chatter)

199
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,020
Captain Doyle, I'm officer
Roland, this is officer Sullivan.

200
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,060
- So what do we have here?

201
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,880
- Detective Bill Wilson, central division.

202
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,870
He was dead before we got here.

203
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,703
- Aw shit.

204
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,470
What the hell was he doing up here.

205
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,350
- Off duty, who knows.

206
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,690
The house is trashed the
suspects not saying anything.

207
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,550
- Where is the suspect.

208
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,383
- He's inside.

209
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,000
- One hell of a fuckin'
party, who lives here?

210
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,663
- The cars registered to a Shara Williams,

211
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:16,550
neighbor across the street saw

212
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,540
the suspect driving the car and then saw

213
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,390
him hopping the fence to the backyard.

214
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,280
- You read him his rights?

215
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,113
- Oh yeah.

216
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,663
- Okey dokey.

217
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:34,723
Where is she?

218
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,970
- And who are you?

219
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,873
- Who am I?

220
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,860
I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare

221
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,430
until you start breaking it
down for me do you understand?

222
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,930
Now where did you get the car?

223
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,030
- I'm done talking till I get a lawyer.

224
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,603
- That's very good,
you're a very mart man.

225
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,620
But you're gonna fucking need one.

226
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,570
- So you're her boyfriend,

227
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,940
you take her to the cabin
and you dump her is that it?

228
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,720
- No that's not it.

229
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,620
She told me her boyfriend
stranded her up there.

230
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,190
Look I didn't even ask
her to come with me.

231
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,750
- So where's she at now?

232
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,893
- I don't know.

233
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:39,880
- You don't know?

234
00:19:40,787 --> 00:19:43,420
You have her car, you're in
her house I mean where is she.

235
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,563
- I told you I don't know.

236
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,773
- Did you kill her?

237
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:48,640
- What?

238
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,910
- Did you kill her?

239
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,473
- No I didn't kill her.

240
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,040
- I think you did kill her.

241
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,080
- I believe my client

242
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,920
has answered that question sufficiently.

243
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
- I believe your client is full of shit.

244
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:01,210
Who the fuck you were with last night?

245
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,260
The tooth fairy?

246
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,320
You wake up, she's gone but she leaves

247
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,020
you the keys to her brand new Beamer?

248
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,290
- She stole my car.

249
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,520
- What did you dive a Rolls Royce.

250
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,870
- Did you report it stolen?

251
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,440
I gotta tell you something son,

252
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,380
I think you're trying
to make a fool of me.

253
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,600
So you're driving a stolen
car, the owner is missing,

254
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,660
her house has been ransacked

255
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,340
and we got a police officer dead.

256
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,630
- That was self defense,

257
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,710
he was trying to kill me he got behind me.

258
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,180
- I got kidnapping, burglary,

259
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,080
grand theft auto and possibly
two counts of murder on you.

260
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,890
And I'm gonna see to it
personally that it sticks.

261
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,773
Take him down to CJ.

262
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,820
Get him the fuck outta my sight.

263
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:46,640
- We'll have you bonded in 24 hours,

264
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,760
don't worry I'll file
the necessary paper work,

265
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,810
everything they've got is circumstantial.

266
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:56,038
(buzzing)

267
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:06,020
(ringing)

268
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,770
(dramatic music)

269
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,567
(suspenseful music)

270
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:15,762
- What the hell is this?

271
00:22:15,762 --> 00:22:17,345
- Shut the fuck up.

272
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:19,520
- You guys are crazy.

273
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,020
- Just get up against the wall.

274
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,810
Don't move hot shot.

275
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,643
You gonna talk to us now.

276
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:24,476
- What what?

277
00:22:32,131 --> 00:22:32,964
- You gonna tell us where

278
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:34,370
she is or am I gonna have to hurt you?

279
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,203
- I told you I don't know anything.

280
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,320
- Have a seat, stay a while.

281
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,153
Come on relax.

282
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:47,100
Now where is the tape?

283
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,030
(whacks)
(cries out)

284
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,870
Where's the tape?

285
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,994
- I don't know what you're talking about!

286
00:22:51,994 --> 00:22:53,046
- Are you fucking stupid?

287
00:22:53,046 --> 00:22:55,620
(whacking)
(cries out)

288
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,230

00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,983
Where is the tape?

290
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:03,250
This is fucking unnecessary,

291
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,890
where is the tape, and where is the girl?

292
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,200
Where is the tape and where is the girl?

293
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,271
- Alright, alright I'll
tell you where the tape is.

294
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:12,104
- Good.

295
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:14,937
- I'll tell you where the tape is.

296
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,927
- You're not so damn tough after all hm?

297
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:19,972
- He's a fucking pussy.

298
00:23:19,972 --> 00:23:22,509
(whacking)
(crying out)

299
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:25,259
(dramatic music)

300
00:23:32,962 --> 00:23:37,639
(shatters)
(dramatic music)

301
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:38,472
- You okay?

302
00:23:38,472 --> 00:23:40,286
- Son of a bitch just broke my nose.

303
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:41,599
- Oh shit go, go, go.

304
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,349
(dramatic music)

305
00:23:56,738 --> 00:24:01,655
(dramatic music)
(barking)

306
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:32,372
(crying out)

307
00:24:35,046 --> 00:24:38,155
(gun fires)

308
00:24:38,155 --> 00:24:40,905
(dramatic music)

309
00:24:45,344 --> 00:24:46,974
- Stan!

310
00:24:46,974 --> 00:24:51,474
(whacks)
(crying out)

311
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,160
(dramatic music)

312
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,183
(gun shots)

313
00:25:22,978 --> 00:25:23,811
- Fucker!

314
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:31,200
(gun shots)

315
00:25:41,418 --> 00:25:44,168
(dramatic music)

316
00:25:53,488 --> 00:25:56,488
(suspenseful music)

317
00:26:18,617 --> 00:26:20,240
5813 I've got

318
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,140
a officer down at 1400 north baldwin copy.

319
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,458
- [Radio] Copy that five alpha 13.

320
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,458
(suspenseful music)

321
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:56,639
(shatters)

322
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,670
(dramatic music)

323
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:31,883
(dramatic music)
(sirens)

324
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:45,480
- What the hell happened?

325
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,580
- He kicked out the back window.

326
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,170
We pursued him into this ware house

327
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,003
and he's gone, he might have gotten

328
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:52,430
a couple miles by now if he's fast.

329
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,290
Stan's in the yard in the back.

330
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,560
- Why didn't you call for backup Marvosa.

331
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,393
- He went to fast!

332
00:27:56,393 --> 00:27:57,450
- Jesus what the hell were you thinking?

333
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,700
- It happened to fast, he's sitting

334
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,420
there quiet as can be and then boom,

335
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,200
we fanned out Stan must
have let his guard down,

336
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,720
I shot him, I shot him!

337
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,760
- I don't know how you
usually work Marvosa.

338
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,880
But this sounds like
damn sloppy work to me.

339
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,035
- This could have happened to anybody!

340
00:28:11,035 --> 00:28:11,952
- Bullshit!

341
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,930
We have another cop dead Marvosa,

342
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,493
there is no excuse for this.

343
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,820
I want this son of a bitch back

344
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,412
in custody tonight do you understand?

345
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:21,245
- Yes.

346
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:22,078
- Do you understand!

347
00:28:22,078 --> 00:28:22,911
- Yes!

348
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,730
- Does everybody understand?

349
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,370
We have a cop killer on the loose people.

350
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,700
I want to set a wider perimeter.

351
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,760
Three miles.

352
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,210
I want units at Baldwin,
Temple, Austin, and Nelson.

353
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,070
We are looking for a male in his 30's,

354
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,180
six feet, one inches tall,

355
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:44,300
185 pounds dark hair,
possibly wounded and cuffed.

356
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,133
Move out.

357
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Give me a cigarette.

358
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,271
- Yes sir.

359
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,660
- No, no don't ever do that.

360
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,972
I don't smoke.

361
00:28:53,972 --> 00:28:56,972
(suspenseful music)

362
00:29:46,883 --> 00:29:49,383
(train horns)

363
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,959
(chattering)

364
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,690
- At least we got a blood
trail so we know he's been hit.

365
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:56,850
- I told ya I hit him.

366
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,680
- So we find his stiff ass in an alley

367
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,340
or we nail him at a hospital somewhere.

368
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,000
Ah Zydowski, it's about time.

369
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,970
- You won't like this.

370
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,340
I ran the prints from the house,

371
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,390
no police record on your suspect at least

372
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,140
not in our files but there
is match on the girl.

373
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,980
- Yeah?

374
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,780
- Her prints belong to Stephanie Field

375
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,240
convinced for soliciting two years ago.

376
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,073
- A hooker.

377
00:30:16,073 --> 00:30:16,960
- That's not all.

378
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,040
- According to the computer

379
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,120
she died of a drug overdose last year.

380
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,980
- Ah a dead hooker, that's great Zydowski

381
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,340
you computer gals are really on the ball.

382
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,230
Listen call the print lab in at the FBI,

383
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,730
let's run the prints
through their library,

384
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,650
see if it's less screwed up than ours.

385
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,483
- Captain.

386
00:30:31,483 --> 00:30:32,400
- Yeah?

387
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,300
- Garret found these in the alley way.

388
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,540
- Marvosa!

389
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,373
- Ya?

390
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,630
- What the hell is this huh?

391
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,780
Apparently we're dealing
with Houdini here?

392
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,790
- Must have gotten the keys off Stanton.

393
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,900
- Surprise, surprise.

394
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,123
I don't need this shit.

395
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,200
- Fuck this I'm gonna find him on my own.

396
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,833
- We're all gonna fan out.

397
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,080
Let do a sweep of the alleys Runyon.

398
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,913
- Yes sir.

399
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:06,420
- Marvosa let's be careful out there huh?

400
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,583
Don't take any chances.

401
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,263
Call for fucking back up this time.

402
00:31:19,986 --> 00:31:22,736

Okay put it through the main line

(suspenseful music)

414
00:32:07,816 --> 00:32:08,649
Bingo.

416
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040

00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,030
Nope there's no file.

418
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,573

He killed Stan.

00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,160
Killed Wilson and he

make it into the system.

526
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,355

528
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,300

like looking for trouble,

549
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,260
basically you know, shoving people around.

550
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,960
He was an asshole.

551
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,450
- And he took a swing at you?

552
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,200
- Yeah I mean the guy was a psycho.

553
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:40,770
I mean I was just there
to protect the girl.

554
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:41,920
- Did he harm the girl?

555
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,490
- Hell he probably raped her in some lot

556
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,140
and them dumped the body somewhere

557
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,090
I mean the guy was a real, he was a real?

558
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:50,923
- Wacko.

559
00:42:50,923 --> 00:42:51,756
- Wacko.

560
00:42:51,756 --> 00:42:52,800
- Wacko.

561
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,793
- Jeez you know that's not
what the bar tender told us.

562
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:59,010
(whacks)

563
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,378
Now you listen to me a seed.

564
00:43:04,378 --> 00:43:05,900
If you don't want to
spend about a year in jail

565
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,160
for making a false report you'll

566
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,710
start giving me straight answers.

567
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,759
You understand that?

568
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:12,170
- Alright, alright we were just

569
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,080
like fucking around with him.

570
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,710
- Yeah he was fucking with him.

571
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,543
- Well.

572
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,293
I was just trying to
have some fun you know.

573
00:43:21,293 --> 00:43:22,983
- What did he do to the girl.

574
00:43:22,983 --> 00:43:23,816
- Nothing, he didn't do nothing.

575
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:28,020
- He just left and she went after him.

576
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,560
- She went after him?

577
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,710
- I don't know, I didn't see it.

578
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,960
- Yeah he was out by then.

579
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,830
What you were, you were out.

580
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:36,780
Man guy clocked ya.

581
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,193
- Take their statement
and get them outta here.

582
00:43:42,444 --> 00:43:44,194
- What ya pushing me for?

583
00:43:44,194 --> 00:43:45,434
- I hate your guts.

584
00:43:45,434 --> 00:43:46,582
- Man.

585
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,749
(ringing)

586
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,603
- Hey man, heard about this morning.

587
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,253
I heard Doyle really went off on you.

588
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,150
You know I don't know if I like

589
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,954
that son of a bitch more
than I did Fletcher.

590
00:44:02,954 --> 00:44:04,924
- Aw now come on, Doyle's just in from

591
00:44:04,924 --> 00:44:07,480
the 77th he's just trying to be a hard ass

592
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,375
and he's just trying to prove himself.

593
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:10,303
- Marvosa.

594
00:44:10,303 --> 00:44:11,930
- Ya.

595
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:12,763
- Come with me.

596
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,307
- Don't you take any shit from him.

597
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:25,750
- I don't take any shit form
anybody Meadows you know that.

598
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:31,770
So what the sisters have to say?

599
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:35,030
- That Shara Williams left the
bar with Trudell on her own.

600
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,340
- So what, lot of girls left the bars

601
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,440
with Ted Bunion that never
stopped him from hacking 'em up.

602
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,410
- Yeah but what was a
Hollywood hair dresser

603
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,880
doing some 60 miles away in some dire bar?

604
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,990
- She's no hair dresser
she's a fucking whore.

605
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,330
Come on, she picks him up, takes him home.

606
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:50,380
Fucks him, he kills her
dumps her body he steals

607
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,247
her car he busts into her house,

608
00:44:51,247 --> 00:44:52,990
that's when Wilson finds him.

609
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,470
- Something else I don't understand.

610
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,460
Why the hell was Wilson up in Hollywood

611
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,140
in the first place last night.

612
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,590
Find that out for me alright.

613
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:02,343
- Excuse me captain.

614
00:45:02,343 --> 00:45:03,176
- What?

615
00:45:03,176 --> 00:45:04,009
- There's a guy waiting in the briefing

616
00:45:04,009 --> 00:45:05,060
room who wants to speak with you.

617
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,893
- Who is it?

618
00:45:05,893 --> 00:45:07,790
- I don't know, RT says he's with the FBI.

619
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,100
- FBI, what the fuck do the feds want?

620
00:45:20,897 --> 00:45:23,310
- Aw let's go cheese cake,

621
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:26,480
checkout time was an hour ago, let's go.

622
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,080
Come on daddy warbucks let's go.

623
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:41,583
Drug addicts.

624
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:54,923
That's the guy.

625
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,640
- Can I help you?

626
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,473
- Captain Doyle?

627
00:46:02,473 --> 00:46:03,306
- [Doyle] Yeah.

628
00:46:03,306 --> 00:46:04,460
- Special agent Craig, FBI.

629
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,670
- That's detective Marvosa.

630
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,503
- Hi.

631
00:46:10,503 --> 00:46:11,340
- [Craig] Hi.

632
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,173
- What can I do for you?

633
00:46:12,173 --> 00:46:13,010
- Well your department called

634
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:16,810
the bureau regarding some
information on a Shara Williams.

635
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,930
- Ah Shara Williams yeah,
I heard nothing came up.

636
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,060
- That's right nothing on her.

637
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,787
But we did a little digging on Jim Trudell

638
00:46:23,787 --> 00:46:27,235
at the request of the sargent Zydowski?

639
00:46:27,235 --> 00:46:28,068
- Zydowski.

640
00:46:28,068 --> 00:46:29,430
- Zydowski, sorry.

641
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:32,853
Jim Trudell, 31 years old, no priors.

642
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,430
He's been working in the
military for ten years.

643
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,273
- Agent Craig we ran the ID.

644
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,563
I could have told you that.

645
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,130
- I don't think you understand.

646
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:50,650
I don't mean he was shuffling
papers in some office.

647
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:53,980
I mean Jim Trudell worked
classified assignments.

648
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,293
Special forces, sabotage
mostly until last year.

649
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,410
He was brought out by espionage charges.

650
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:04,340
Charges that were later dropped.

651
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,240
He left he service and
we lost track of him.

652
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,160
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

653
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,090
What are you getting at?

654
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:11,270
Are you telling me this guy has

655
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,010
some sort of agenda down here?

656
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,140
- I'm telling you the Breuer

657
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,530
considers all threats very seriously.

658
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:17,840
And as long as Jim Trudell is on

659
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,743
the streets he is a clear
threat to the public at large.

660
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:23,030
- But if what you say is true

661
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:25,280
why would he have killed
two police officers?

662
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:28,620
- Well that's the point
you see, he's slipped up.

663
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,890
But I'm sure if our departments

664
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,423
work together we can get
to the bottom of this.

665
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,860
- Cooperate?

666
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,283
- Every step of the way.

667
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,423
- If you guys want in fine.

668
00:47:44,805 --> 00:47:48,893
Just remember this is my jurisdiction.

669
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,233
Marvosa.

670
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,410
- Captain we got a positive ID

671
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:00,510
of Trudell about 15 minutes ago in Venice.

672
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,620
- Okay guys we're back on the road again.

673
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:05,010
Notify all units we're on our way,

674
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,100
agent Craig you're my guest.

675
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,250
- I'm right behind you.

676
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:13,975
(dramatic music)

677
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:20,063
- Ya it's Marvosa, get down to Venice.

678
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:24,541
(upbeat music)

679
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,870
- [Phone] Operator can I help you?

680
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,230
- Operator I'd like to
make a collect call.

681
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:36,120
213 555 0972.

682
00:49:38,067 --> 00:49:38,900
- [Tubs Answering Machine] Hi this is Tubs

683
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,450
sorry I can't answer the phone right now

684
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:42,660
but I'm out, leave a message.

685
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,460
- [Operator] Sorry sir, I'm
getting an answering machine.

686
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,293
- Thank you.

687
00:49:46,158 --> 00:49:47,226
- How about you man?

688
00:49:47,226 --> 00:49:48,278
You gonna pitch in something?

689
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:50,210
(sirens)

690
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:51,923
Hey asshole, hey.

691
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,740
- Alright ladies and gentlemen listen up

692
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,500
we all know who we're looking for.

693
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,790
I want everybody to play

694
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:00,630
it cool till the time
is right to make a move.

695
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:01,960
Let's not pull any gang buster

696
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,310
shit or we might loose this guy again.

697
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:07,170
- Or worse we might have a
hostage situation on our hands.

698
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,590
- If you can trail him
to a remote area, do it.

699
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,327
We all want a piece of this guy

700
00:50:12,327 --> 00:50:14,660
but let's keep our heads and stay within

701
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:17,030
the law, we've got people
everywhere out here.

702
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:18,490
- These crowds are gonna be a bitch sir.

703
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:19,680
- I'm sure you can handle it,

704
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,370
right now I wanna do
an alley to alley sweep

705
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:25,320
beginning at the north and
south ends form Mariner to 30th.

706
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,580
Foot units you will
continue on the board walk.

707
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,930
That's it people, move out.

708
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,523
- I'm gonna take the south end.

709
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:36,682
- Fine.

710
00:50:36,682 --> 00:50:39,432
(dramatic music)

711
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:42,283
- [Craig] Shall we?

712
00:50:45,682 --> 00:50:48,265
(upbeat music)

713
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:55,035
- Yeah?

714
00:50:55,035 --> 00:50:55,868
- [Marvosa] Who is this?

715
00:50:55,868 --> 00:50:56,701
Give me DT.

716
00:50:56,701 --> 00:50:59,253
- Hold on a second, DT.

717
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,273
It's for you.

718
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,673
- Yeah?

719
00:51:07,673 --> 00:51:08,770
- [Marvosa] DT where you at?

720
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:11,070
- We're in Vinence.

721
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,530
- [Marvosa] Good good good, you set to go?

722
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:13,490
- Yeah what do you think?

723
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,890
- [Marvosa] Alright I want you
to stay by the phone alright?

724
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:16,723
- Whatever.

725
00:51:16,723 --> 00:51:17,556

DT where are you, can anybody hear me?

771
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,130

772
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:03,880
- Yeah who's this?

773
00:56:05,732 --> 00:56:08,313
- Trudell, I just got your number.

774
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:11,943

(sirens)

776
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,770

00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:33,250
- It's a car jacking, he took the car.

778
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,290
- What car?

779
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,550
- Gray Mercedes Bendz,

780
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:37,490
all jazzed up and shit, the guy's crazy.

781
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:38,980
- Son of a bitch.

782
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,200
- Did you get a license number?

783
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,850
- No but it was a brand new van.

784
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:44,372
- Which way'd he go?

785
00:56:44,372 --> 00:56:45,205
- That way.

786
00:56:45,205 --> 00:56:46,476
- That way, is he alone?

787
00:56:46,476 --> 00:56:47,607
- By himself.

788
00:56:47,607 --> 00:56:52,607
(sirens)
(suspenseful music)

789
00:56:58,844 --> 00:57:01,427

00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:25,610

794
00:57:56,813 --> 00:57:59,063

00:58:02,631 --> 00:58:04,881
(knocking)

796
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:11,983
- Holy shit.

797
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:14,143
- Hello Tubbs.

798
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,470
Can I come in.

799
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:20,223
- Yeah sure, come on in man,
you scared the hell out of me.

800
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:24,508
You know I thought I dreamt
that phone call this morning.

801
00:58:24,508 --> 00:58:26,258
What the hell you been up to buddy?

802
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,530
Dude you look like shit, are you okay?

803
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:37,733
Jimmy you flipping out
on me, what going on?

804
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,230
- I don't know.

805
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:43,083
- You don't know?

806
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:48,150
- No.

807
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,730
- Look Jimmy you know I haven't seen

808
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,190
you in eight years, you show up on my door

809
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:52,250
like you're on drugs or something

810
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,953
the least you could do is tell
me what the fuck going on.

811
00:58:57,930 --> 00:58:58,930
- Two cops are dead.

812
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,930
- What?

813
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:03,433
- I killed two cops.

814
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,692
- Oh shit, shit, shit.

815
00:59:06,692 --> 00:59:09,442
Jimmy I don't know about this
man, I mean are you sure?

816
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:11,863
- Yeah I'm sure.

817
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,820
- Jimmy do you realize what

818
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:15,710
you've done that's like
death penalty shit.

819
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:18,240
- It was self defense
Tubbs, they were dirty.

820
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,223
I stumbled onto some auto theft
ring they were involved in.

821
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:23,460
You've gotta help me.

822
00:59:30,511 --> 00:59:33,420
- Alright, alright you
saved my ass enough times,

823
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:36,420
what do you want me to do?

824
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,290
- I hope you haven't lost
your touch with this stuff.

825
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:40,650
- Shit what I have now made

826
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:42,583
our set up look like tinker toys.

827
00:59:43,598 --> 00:59:44,840
I've been skipping through internal

828
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,610
revenue records all day, I
even got video strip poker.

829
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:49,437
So where do you wanna start?

830
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:51,790
- A girl named Shara Williams.

831
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,900
- Captain Doyle did
you read today's paper?

832
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,820
- No Zydowski, I did
not read today's paper,

833
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,073
it will just irritate the hell out of me.

834
01:00:06,073 --> 01:00:08,203
- Well read this.

835
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:12,170
- So?

836
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:13,610
Something I don't know already?

837
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,760
- Well it's just kind of
a coincidence isn't it,

838
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,990
Stan and Wilson both started in 83,

839
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,563
both in area six, both in Vice?

840
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:23,193
- Hey they found the Mercedes Trudell

841
01:00:23,193 --> 01:00:26,230
used in his getaway, it's
in a parking lot in Venice.

842
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:27,230
- Good, good we'll get it

843
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:29,220
to the nearest station,
hold it for prints.

844
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,053
You coming?

845
01:00:30,053 --> 01:00:31,683
- Round trip or one way?

846
01:00:32,767 --> 01:00:35,818
(chuckles)

847
01:00:35,818 --> 01:00:36,940
- Where the hell is Marvosa?

848
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:39,023
- He said he was searching out some lead.

849
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:42,460
- Get his ass down to the garage.

850
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,903
Some lead.

851
01:00:45,948 --> 01:00:48,531
(upbeat music)

852
01:01:02,198 --> 01:01:04,094
- What's up man, what's going on?

853
01:01:04,094 --> 01:01:05,450
What happened to DT?

854
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:08,390
- DT got shit canned so did
Droopy, the other two are dead.

855
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:09,705
- Damn.

856
01:01:09,705 --> 01:01:11,247
Who's this fucking clown huh?

857
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:13,640
- I don't know, I don't know

858
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,983
where she got him I don't
know where he comes from.

859
01:01:15,983 --> 01:01:18,710
He's very good, he given
me a real pain in the ass,

860
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:19,920
I could have hoped enough Mercedes

861
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,120
today to make half a million bucks.

862
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,520
I gotta get rid of this guy.

863
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:27,902
- We will, we get rid of him like that.

864
01:01:27,902 --> 01:01:29,370
But you know what?

865
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:32,210
This time you gotta pay
you know what I'm saying?

866
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,750
If you want the pros it's gonna cost ya.

867
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:36,090
- It's gonna cost everybody
if I get shut down,

868
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:38,500
that's just the price of doing business.

869
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,963
- What ever homes, it's
gonna cost you 50 Gs.

870
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:47,553
That's it, 50 Gs is it on or what?

871
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,450
Hey homes, don't waste my
time is it on or what ey?

872
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:53,283
- You're on.

873
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:55,940
- Starting to bug me man.

874
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:56,793
- Not today man.

875
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:01,340
- [Radio] 5813 report to Burtell

876
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:04,373
tow n' pound lot 401 north Magnolia.

877
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:07,983
- Hello, 5813.

878
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,000
- [Radio] Please report to Burtell

879
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,973
tow n' pound lot 401
north Magnolia right away.

880
01:02:14,174 --> 01:02:15,007
- I'm on my way.

881
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:19,695
(engine rumbles)

882
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:27,530
- So how do you know they
can't catch ya on this thing.

883
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:29,540
- I don't, but I'm pretty sure.

884
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:30,530
It's kind of a long story

885
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:32,340
but I cloned the serial link up

886
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:33,710
with the binary code scrambler,

887
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:36,320
sent it through a network main frame.

888
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,990
So if they do try to trace it

889
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:39,840
it'll be to a pick and save on Peeko.

890
01:02:40,817 --> 01:02:42,990
- I knew I could count on you Tubbs.

891
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:45,783
- Yeah well I got a lot of free
time, you know what I mean.

892
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,820
Bagel?

893
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:50,653
- No thanks.

894
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:56,440
- Okay county tax records are showing

895
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,707
that a 601 Oxford court is owned by a

896
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:05,503
Atlantic trust corporation
with a PO box in Dc.

897
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,760
Nothing here about a Shara Williams.

898
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:13,100
- How about Marvosa and the others?

899
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,920
- I'm gonna have to
access the LAPD mainframe

900
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,993
but we gotta be careful,
that ones kinda tricky.

901
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,000
So what happened to ya
Jimmy, I figured you'd

902
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,430
be in some far off place somewhere

903
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:27,560
living life on the edge
like the good old days.

904
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,093
- I gave up all that, got
tired of all the lies.

905
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,610
They tried to stuff me in Levenworth

906
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,860
to cover there asses on
a botched assignment.

907
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,530
Got so I couldn't tell who to trust.

908
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,730
Somethings never change.

909
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:43,760
- Yeah well no ones gonna cover
your ass this time either.

910
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,883
- So what else is new?

911
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:47,733
- Yup.

912
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,290
I got something here.

913
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:55,860
Personal records here on
Wilson, Stanton, Marvosa.

914
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,323
Addresses, and phone numbers.

915
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:01,893
Bingo, I'll cross reference
them to see what we got.

916
01:04:01,893 --> 01:04:04,893
(suspenseful music)

917
01:04:16,082 --> 01:04:18,499
- Agent Craig, we got a call.

918
01:04:19,732 --> 01:04:21,982
(whirring)

919
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:32,293
- So what do we got in there?

920
01:04:32,293 --> 01:04:33,980
- What don't we have in here?

921
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:38,250
We have Cd player, radar
detector, cell phone.

922
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,590
Automatic weapons.

923
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:41,910
- What is this?

924
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:44,360
- Get away car, did you
say cell phone Zydowski?

925
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,590
- [Zydowski] Yeah.

926
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,770
- Well that just may be out ticket.

927
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:48,720
- What do you mean?

928
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:52,130
- Maybe Jim Trudell called
someone from the car.

929
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,307
- He'd have to be pretty
fucking stupid to do that,

930
01:04:55,307 --> 01:04:58,010
I mean he knows hat we're
gonna find the car right?

931
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:00,910
- Maybe but it would be even
stupider not to check it out.

932
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,020
- Marvosa why don't you get
that information for us,

933
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,880
call the phone company find out what calls

934
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,090
were made on this extension
over the past 48 hours.

935
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:09,923
- You got it.

936
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:15,263
- Well I guess it's safe to assume

937
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,230
this guy has some sort of weapon on him.

938
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:19,700
- Well he had quite the
election to choose from.

939
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,803
The question is who's his next target.

940
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:24,461
- Marvosa.

941
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:27,910
When did you join the force?

942
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:29,310
- What?

943
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:31,410
- When did you join the fore.

944
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:33,770
You know the police
force the place you work.

945
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:37,600
- 1984, why what the fuck
difference does that make?

946
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,283
- Did you start out area six?

947
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:42,563
- Yeah.

948
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,690
- So you must have known
Wilson and Stanton huh?

949
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:48,660
- They worked Vice I seen 'em around.

950
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,810
- Well don't you think
that's a little odd?

951
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:51,879
- What?

952
01:05:51,879 --> 01:05:53,883
- Well it's kind of a
funny coincidence isn't it?

953
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:56,640
- They had to start someplace.

954
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,090
- Where did you start Mavosa?

955
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,100
- Traffic.

956
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:01,933
- [Man] Doyle.

957
01:06:01,933 --> 01:06:02,766
- Yeah?

958
01:06:02,766 --> 01:06:04,770
- We got some hacker
accessing your personnel

959
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:07,590
files of detectives Wilson and Stanton.

960
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:09,210
Yours to Marvosa.

961
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:10,880
- The fuck are you talking about?

962
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,050
- Do we have an address.

963
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:12,883
- Yeah.

964
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:16,320
- Alright this could be or guy Trudell.

965
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,790
Get a swat team on that
building right away.

966
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:19,623
Come on let's get down there

967
01:06:19,623 --> 01:06:21,466
and find out what the hell is going on.

968
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,500
Craig you stay with Marvosa.

969
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:30,913
- Hey, hey Jimmy check this out.

970
01:06:32,045 --> 01:06:34,170
Look Marvosa makes calls
to their fax number

971
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:37,003
over seas and this is
Switzerland country code.

972
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:38,693
- A bank?

973
01:06:38,693 --> 01:06:41,070
- I don't know maybe he's
selling swis army knives,

974
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:43,300
I can't access that but look at this.

975
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,730
These are their local account

976
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:46,913
records for Wilson and Marvosa.

977
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:49,793
- Stealing cars is big business.

978
01:06:49,793 --> 01:06:52,243
- Yeah well they certainly
ain't police salaries.

979
01:06:54,103 --> 01:06:56,270
(ringing)

980
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:04,000
Hello?

981
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,250
- [Stephanie] I want to
speak to Jim Trudell.

982
01:07:07,122 --> 01:07:09,482
(dramatic music)

983
01:07:09,482 --> 01:07:11,122
- I think you to he wrong number.

984
01:07:11,122 --> 01:07:12,740
- [Stephanie] Jim I know you're there,

985
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:14,940

986
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:18,120
The police are on the way meet me at

987
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,040
the ware house on the corner

988
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,630
of silver bay and Nohiot
park as soon as you can.

989
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:22,530
- What's going on?

990
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:24,920
- You'll find out soon enough.

991
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:28,080
- Shit, shit, shit, shit
they're gonna skin me alive.

992
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,750
- That was her the girl, we have to go.

993
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:31,050
- No I'm not going anywhere.

994
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:32,560
- Tubbs these people mean business.

995
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:33,550
- Look I told you I'm not going anywhere,

996
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,450
I've got my whole life in this place.

997
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:37,040
- Stop being so damn stubborn.

998
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,668
- Look I can't help you
anymore Jimmy I'm sorry.

999
01:07:39,668 --> 01:07:41,918
(clicking)

1000
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:44,883
- I don't got anyway to get there.

1001
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:50,272
(suspenseful music)

1002
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,460
- It's a Harley down in the garage,

1003
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:57,010
I don't exactly use it anymore.

1004
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:02,850
- Thanks for everything Tubbs.

1005
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,900
- Don't forget the helmet.

1006
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:10,603
You don't want a ticket on your record.

1007
01:08:11,566 --> 01:08:14,566
(suspenseful music)

1008
01:08:23,748 --> 01:08:28,748
(sirens)
(suspenseful music)

1009
01:08:32,688 --> 01:08:35,438
(engine rumbles)

1010
01:08:41,237 --> 01:08:43,020
Who the fuck are you?

1011
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:44,660
Don't you guys ever knock?

1012
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:45,590
- Where is he?

1013
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:46,623
- Long gone.

1014
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:50,547
- You don't mind if I don't
take your ord for that do you?

1015
01:08:53,847 --> 01:08:55,850
- No, no look around all you want,

1016
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:58,803
just walk softly I got a cake in the oven.

1017
01:08:58,803 --> 01:09:01,553
(dramatic music)

1018
01:09:09,413 --> 01:09:10,763
- [Radio] 6815 do you copy?

1019
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:12,833
- 6815 go.

1020
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:14,903
- [Radio] We've got a unit on

1021
01:09:14,903 --> 01:09:17,800
the scene reporting this
address is coming up short.

1022
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,020
Looks like a pick and save you copy?

1023
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:21,740
- A pick and save?

1024
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:23,370
- They must be kidding.

1025
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:25,130
- Am I hearing you correctly?

1026
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:26,430
- That is correct captain.

1027
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:29,280
- We're on our way anyway,

1028
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,080
I want to see this with my own eyes.

1029
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:33,690
What the hell is going on.

1030
01:09:40,882 --> 01:09:43,292
- So he's long gone huh?

1031
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:44,125
- Yeah I asked him not to tell me

1032
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:46,553
where he's going, I told
him I didn't want any part.

1033
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,220
- Got a license for this weapon?

1034
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:54,313
- Yeah I got it registered
with the DMV last week.

1035
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,500
- Then you're a smart man.

1036
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,333
- That's right.

1037
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:01,320
And that's all I'm gonna say.

1038
01:10:03,183 --> 01:10:08,183
- You got some balls
man, you got some balls.

1039
01:10:09,111 --> 01:10:11,444
(gun shots)

1040
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:24,010
(engine rumbles)

1041
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:28,554
(suspenseful music)

1042
01:10:44,622 --> 01:10:47,622
(suspenseful music)

1043
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:53,103
- Hi Jim.

1044
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,563
- Hands in the air please, FBI.

1045
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:03,910
- Understand there's a lot
of people looking for you.

1046
01:11:05,948 --> 01:11:07,048
I know how that feels.

1047
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:09,727
- Why did you set me up?

1048
01:11:11,758 --> 01:11:12,675
- I didn't.

1049
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:15,730
I thought maybe you'd be smart enough

1050
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,180
just to leave everything alone,

1051
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:18,590
I left you the keys to the BMW.

1052
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:19,800
- Well you thought wrong

1053
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,623
and now I'm public enemy number one.

1054
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:23,850
You got something to say to that?

1055
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:26,593
- Yeah it was my life that
was in danger not yours!

1056
01:11:28,756 --> 01:11:30,656
- What the hell are you talking about?

1057
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,540
- I'm a witness.

1058
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:34,653
- A witness to what?

1059
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:43,010
- Six months ago a police officer

1060
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:44,803
was found dead in a hotel room.

1061
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:46,743
Charlie Fletcher.

1062
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,793
Blew his brains out.

1063
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:53,750
He didn't leave a note,
maybe you heard about it.

1064
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:54,900
- No but I'm listening.

1065
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:59,470
- It wasn't a suicide he
was killed by professionals.

1066
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:01,420
I was in the bathroom when it happened.

1067
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:05,050
- Well didn't these professionals

1068
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:06,960
figure he had a girl in his room?

1069
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:07,803
- Yeah they did.

1070
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,093
One girl.

1071
01:12:16,153 --> 01:12:17,409
- Don't go yet.

1072
01:12:17,409 --> 01:12:18,242
Not yet.

1073
01:12:18,242 --> 01:12:19,075
- I'll be back.

1074
01:12:19,075 --> 01:12:21,825
(dramatic music)

1075
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,700
Charlie Fletcher liked to move

1076
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,763
around a lot but he was a regular.

1077
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,533
And he always paid for the kink.

1078
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:48,090
I had to call another
appointment and cancel,

1079
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:50,670
Fletcher wanted to party all night.

1080
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:52,790
And he made it worth my while.

1081
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:53,783
- Hey Marvosa, what he hell
are you doing here man?

1082
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:58,733
- [Stephanie] But then I
heard the front door open.

1083
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,949
And I heard voices.

1084
01:13:01,949 --> 01:13:04,130
(gun fires)

1085
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:04,963
And a gun shot.

1086
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:07,990
- Listen don't kill me
man, I didn't do it.

1087
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:10,753
Please don't kill me,
listen I didn't do it.

1088
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:14,703
(gun fires)

1089
01:13:18,486 --> 01:13:19,867
- [Marvosa] You been a bad boy,

1090
01:13:19,867 --> 01:13:21,743
now you're a dead motherfucker.

1091
01:13:22,707 --> 01:13:25,387
Sleeping with a 14 year
old girl you bad boy.

1092
01:13:26,387 --> 01:13:27,220
- [Stephanie] It seemed

1093
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:28,653
like I waited forever before coming out.

1094
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,673
And when I did.

1095
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:33,193
There they were.

1096
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:38,440
No struggle no commotion just dead.

1097
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,110
- [Jim] Then what you'd do?

1098
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:42,990
- [Stephanie] I just waned to get out,

1099
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:44,850
I grabbed my stuff up and then I found it.

1100
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:46,800
- [Jim] Found what?

1101
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,763
- [Stephanie] I noticed
something behind the curtain.

1102
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:53,210
It seemed like Charlie liked
to watch over and over again.

1103
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:54,363
I got it all on tape.

1104
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:58,440
That's when I met him.

1105
01:14:00,130 --> 01:14:01,223
Told him what I had.

1106
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:04,823
The FBI set me up in a new place.

1107
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:10,483
The cops found me somehow so I ran.

1108
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,180
That's when I met you.

1109
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,273
- So what happened to the tape?

1110
01:14:16,273 --> 01:14:17,723
- It's in a safe place.

1111
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:28,700
- So you know about Stanton,
Wilson, and Marvosa.

1112
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:31,250
- Oh yeah, they were fancy and luxury

1113
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:34,000
cars and making sure the
thefts weren't followed up on.

1114
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:39,870
- You found all this out
and you didn't do anything?

1115
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:42,980
- Well I didn't go after
them if that what you mean.

1116
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:43,823
They came to me.

1117
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,200
Once the detectives found

1118
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,420
that empty video camera in the motel room.

1119
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:49,253
- What?

1120
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,153
- Hi.

1121
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:55,253
Hi.

1122
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:59,313
- Sorry about this, I
didn't want to do this.

1123
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,050
I didn't want to get in this deep.

1124
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:06,048
But money talks you know what I mean?

1125
01:15:06,048 --> 01:15:08,798
(dramatic music)

1126
01:15:11,229 --> 01:15:12,062
- You know you're crippled buddy

1127
01:15:12,062 --> 01:15:13,760
was a brave man, it's
to bad you killed him.

1128
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,020
- You son of a bitch!

1129
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,793
- Hey, hey, come on now,
we still got work to do.

1130
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:22,640
Now Stephanie I know you
made copies of that tape.

1131
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,713
And now you're gonna
show us where they are.

1132
01:15:25,725 --> 01:15:27,925
(gun fires)

1133
01:15:27,925 --> 01:15:30,175
(shatters)

1134
01:15:31,867 --> 01:15:34,155
(whacking)
(crying out)

1135
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:35,816

1136
01:15:35,816 --> 01:15:38,566
(dramatic music)

1137
01:15:40,023 --> 01:15:41,721
- Where the fuck where you?

1138
01:15:41,721 --> 01:15:44,471

1139
01:15:50,673 --> 01:15:53,006
(gun shots)

1140
01:15:55,753 --> 01:15:58,503

(dramatic music)

1149
01:16:45,689 --> 01:16:47,106
The van, come on.

1150
01:16:52,571 --> 01:16:53,661

1151
01:16:53,661 --> 01:16:54,751
- Come on let's go.

(gun firing)

1154
01:17:09,222 --> 01:17:11,411
- Get the fuck out of there.

1155
01:17:11,411 --> 01:17:13,880
(yelling)

1156
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,880
(suspenseful music)

1157
01:17:29,942 --> 01:17:34,942
(gun shots)
(suspenseful music)

1158
01:17:54,690 --> 01:17:56,940
(shatters)

1159
01:18:00,069 --> 01:18:02,236
(yelling)

1160
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,980
(suspenseful music)

1161
01:18:14,766 --> 01:18:19,599
(honking)
(alarm ringing)

1162
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:23,782
- The gate.

1163
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,275
(rattling)

1164
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:33,442
Shit, come on.

1165
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,303
Get behind the dumpster.

1166
01:18:40,303 --> 01:18:43,303
(suspenseful music)

1167
01:19:44,478 --> 01:19:49,145

1168
01:20:12,689 --> 01:20:13,550

1169
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:16,110
(gun fires)

1170
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:18,393
- Shut the fuck up you stupid bitch.

1171
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:23,570
You've been giving me a real fucking

1172
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:25,820

1173
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:27,331
And now I'm about to give you one.

01:20:27,331 --> 01:20:31,998
(whacking)
(crying out)

1175
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:00,013
Come on, come here.

(gun shots)
(dramatic chord)

1177
01:21:16,008 --> 01:21:18,091
(sirens)

1178
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,698
- I thought you were shot.

1179
01:21:24,698 --> 01:21:25,978
- I was just faking it.

1180
01:21:25,978 --> 01:21:30,145
(crying)
(sirens)

1181
01:21:36,253 --> 01:21:38,309
- Haven't you ever heard
of a bullet proof vest?

1182
01:21:38,309 --> 01:21:39,280
Don't even try it, don't even try it,

1183
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,320
I will fucking kill her!

1184
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,377
I will cut her!

1185
01:21:42,377 --> 01:21:45,127
(dramatic music)

1186
01:21:49,887 --> 01:21:50,720
(gun fires)

1187
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:53,470
(dramatic music)

1188
01:22:00,201 --> 01:22:02,534
- Trudell, put the gun down.

1189
01:22:13,691 --> 01:22:16,480
(chattering)

1190
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,821
- There's plenty more
where this came from, here.

1191
01:22:19,821 --> 01:22:20,654
- What is it.

1192
01:22:20,654 --> 01:22:22,000
- I don't want to ruin the surprise.

1193
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,883
- Ah yes, more surprises that
all I need, tag this Runyon.

1194
01:22:27,414 --> 01:22:29,914
With time it's looking
better and better everyday.

1195
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:32,450
- You alright?

1196
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:33,480
- I'll live.

1197
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:36,340
- Good cause I have
several thousand questions

1198
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:38,200
that the two of you are
gonna answer for me.

1199
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,573
- Great maybe this time you'll believe me.

1200
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:42,773
- Maybe I will.

1201
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:47,170
You know you would have made
one hell of a cop Trudell.

1202
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:48,273
- Wasn't in the cards.

1203
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,313
- Let's go.

1204
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,370
- You know there's something

1205
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:58,030
I've been meaning to ask you Stephanie.

1206
01:22:58,030 --> 01:22:59,550
- Yeah?

1207
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:01,180
- Where the hells my car?

1208
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:02,500
- Uh.

1209
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:06,060
Have you ever heard of the Liefolk river?

1210
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,480
- [Jim] No.

1211
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,893
- [Stephanie] I didn't either.

1212
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,016
I'll make it up to you.

1213
01:23:13,016 --> 01:23:14,416
Promise.

1214
01:23:14,416 --> 01:23:16,096
(chuckles)

1215
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:18,679
(upbeat music)
