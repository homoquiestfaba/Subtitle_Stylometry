[upbeat music playing]

4
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,767
You know you're not
welcome here.

5
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,219
[Chris] How much?

6
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:30,258
It's less than expected.

7
00:02:30,893 --> 00:02:32,695
[Chris] We've been doing these
little scams for years.

8
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:33,796
We need to aim higher.

9
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,932
Why are you dressed
like that anyway?

10
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:38,500
We need more.

11
00:02:40,502 --> 00:02:41,871
Is it ever gonna be enough?

12
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:44,874
Something's missing.

13
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:46,541
[Jerry] Yeah,
maybe a proper plan dude.

14
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:47,910
[sirens]

15
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,412
Shoot. You guys... You guys go!

16
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:51,881
I'll distract the cops.
Go, go, go!

17
00:02:53,683 --> 00:02:54,884

[police sirens]

19
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:12,735
[Chris] I consider myself
a very intelligent person

20
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:15,872
but at times I make mistakes,
I'm honest.

21
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:18,573
It's true, I'm a liar.

22
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:21,878
Let's say that often
I'm confused.

23
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:25,313
I don't know what I do
or why I do it.

24
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:28,050
Does that make sense?

25
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:32,755
No.
None of this makes sense.

26
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:34,523
Your honor,
we have seen this defendant

27
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:36,092
in the courtroom way
too many times!

28
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,326
This time the state
wants him behind bars.

29
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,062
Mr. Gibson,

30
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:42,564
have you learned anything
from what happened?

31
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,401
Yeah that running away
isn't always the best option.

32
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,108
You decided to defend yourself
without an attorney.

33
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:54,509
I don't need attorneys.
I don't need anyone!

34
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,379
I have the impression

35
00:03:57,747 --> 00:04:00,616
you're not giving
the necessary importance

36
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,484
- [phone ringing]
- to this hearing,

37
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:07,924
or to this court!

38
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,560
This is an offense
to the entire judicial system.

39
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:15,397
He is clearly deserving
of some kind of punishment.

40
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,634
Rehabilitation, not punishment.

41
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:22,470
So you were in foster homes

42
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:23,639
- for years?
- Yeah.

43
00:04:24,073 --> 00:04:25,574
Since my dad killed my mom.

44
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,744
It was a car accident

45
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:29,846
but I don't remember
much about it.

46
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:33,448
But you still have
a grandmother?

47
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:35,885
She had a breakdown
after what happened

48
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,020
and I never saw her after that.

49
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,089
She lives in Kentucky but

50
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:42,692
I don't think she remembers
who I am.

51
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:44,827
It's been many years
and she has that thing

52
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:46,494
that makes you lose your memory.

53
00:04:48,463 --> 00:04:51,734
So I sentence you
to house arrest

54
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:56,639
at your grandmother's
residence for two weeks.

55
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:58,641
You-you can't do that!

56
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:01,376
It's my courtroom!

57
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:04,379
And I'm old enough to do
as I please.

58
00:05:05,214 --> 00:05:07,617
Two weeks in the middle
of nowhere?!

59
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,719
Let's make it four weeks.

60
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:13,455
I hope that'll be enough
to make a difference.

61
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:19,829
[soft music playing]

62
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:13,849
Pastor John, let me help you.

63
00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:17,519
What about my bags?

64
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:19,789
I work for your grandmother,
not you.

65
00:06:20,222 --> 00:06:21,590
Mmhm.

66
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:25,227
She gave you more food
for the homeless?

67
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:28,097
No, no, it's for the town fair.

68
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,066
Although it's been decades
since we had one.

69
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,500
We can't give up hope.

70
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:35,470
You always need to stand firm
in the faith.

71
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:37,807
Be courageous.

72
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:40,009
Be strong.

[giggles] First Corinthians
Chapter sixteen, verse thirteen.

74
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,231
- [Melody] Who are you?
- Jesus Christ!

75
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,968
Are you really Jesus?

76
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:08,738
No I'm your grandson, Chris.

77
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:09,972
Oh.

78
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:11,941
Chris.

79
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:15,878
[scoffs] Well Chris,

80
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:18,513
you're just in time for tea.

81
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:19,949
Ah Joe.

82
00:07:23,052 --> 00:07:25,221
Could you please make some tea?

83
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:27,323
We have company.

84
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:29,557
Yes ma'am, with pleasure.

85
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:36,899
Look honey, what I found.

86
00:07:41,203 --> 00:07:44,273
Remind me again, who are you?

87
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:47,610
Chopin!

88
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,912
Come here, kitty.

89
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,983
Come here pretty kitty,
and eat a cookie.

90
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,752
Careful, Ms. Melody.
This tea is hot.

91
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:03,893
Oh, how lovely.

92
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,563
We haven't had a visitor
in quite a while.

93
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,706
Well, I just love tea time.

94
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,046
Beethoven!

95
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,850
You haven't eaten a thing today.

96
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:31,020
Come here and eat
at least one cookie.

97
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:35,291
Come here. Come here.
Come kitty.

98
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:38,661
Come, you haven't eaten
a thing all day.

99
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:47,169
I hope you'll feel at home here.

100
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:48,737
I'll be OK.

101
00:08:49,105 --> 00:08:50,873
It's already
a major upgrade for me,

102
00:08:51,507 --> 00:08:53,242
I never had my own room before.

103
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:56,846
Yeah, well,
this is not your room.

104
00:08:57,413 --> 00:09:00,716
So, kindly refrain from moving
or touching any personal items.

105
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,919
Dinner will be served at 7.
Sharp.

106
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:05,955
Right.

107
00:09:06,388 --> 00:09:07,823
What's there to do around here?

108
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,025
You're gonna need
to help me with the farm

109
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:12,128
and your grandmother.

110
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:18,701
- Hey Joe?
- Yep.

111
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:20,402
What's the Wi-Fi password?

112
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:23,405
[laughs] There ain't
no internet here.

[soft music plays]

114
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:33,909
Excuse me.

115
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:43,786
Can you keep a secret?

116
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:46,055
[scoffs] Yeah, sure, grandma.

117
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,023
Come.

118
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:51,227
I show you my treasure.

119
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:01,503
Come on.

120
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,439
Come on.

121
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,081
It looks like someone
has a thing for corn.

122
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,784
Corn was domesticated in Mexico

123
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:18,887
over 10 000 years ago.

124
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:24,026
The deeper you go
the better the corn.

125
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:27,229
Of course,
you have to have

126
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:29,398
the right amount of water too.

127
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:33,302
We have the biggest
corn farm in Kentucky.

128
00:11:33,703 --> 00:11:36,905
- Really?
- I'm the queen of corn.

129
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:41,243
I think...

130
00:11:41,944 --> 00:11:45,147
[scoffs] Who cares
about all of that anyway?

Chris! Chris! Oh my God,
I'm glad you're ok.

00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:08,991
Finally getting some signal
out here,

137
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:10,492
but just getting all your
messages now.

138
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:12,394
- [Chris] How's Kim?
- Oh, she's good.

139
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:14,029
She's actually
right here with me.

140
00:14:14,764 --> 00:14:17,466
You guys gotta drive down here
as soon as possible.

141
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:20,135
- What's going on?
- Yeah, drive where?

142
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:22,672
To the wonderful countryside
of Kentucky!

143
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:26,508
Why?

144
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:31,046
I finally found the treasure
we've been looking for.

[piano playing]

146
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:43,726
Ah.

148
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:50,065
Ms. Melody,
you play really well.

149
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,434
And that tune is beautiful.

150
00:14:53,335 --> 00:14:54,737
It's Mary's favorite.

151
00:14:57,306 --> 00:15:00,743
Tomorrow we'll all have
breakfast together.

152
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:03,445
I'll make French toast.

153
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:06,448
You'll see how she devours it.

154
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:07,684
Yeah.

155
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:10,753
It's time to go to bed.

156
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:20,630
Okay.

00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:07,342
There's work to do.

- Here you go. Right here.
- [Chris grunts]

163
00:17:00,697 --> 00:17:02,765
There's so much to do
around here.

164
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,499
Yes. This is only the beginning.

165
00:17:04,934 --> 00:17:07,436
Property runs on
for hundreds of acres.

166
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:10,505
This whole property belongs
to Melody?

167
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:12,140
Yep.

168
00:17:12,174 --> 00:17:14,343
[scoffs]

169
00:17:16,946 --> 00:17:18,815
I better go change,
I smell like a...

170
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:20,148

172
00:17:21,884 --> 00:17:23,720
Yeah.
Let's say I was gonna say that.

173
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:26,488
[Joe] Hey, just be quick, OK?

174

[soft guitar playing]

176
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,648
Sorry guys, I got no signal,
but I'm on my way to meet you.

177
00:17:51,681 --> 00:17:53,215
I hope you get this.

178
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:35,390
How do you like it today?

179
00:18:35,825 --> 00:18:37,492
It's the same everyday.

180
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:40,562
Well some days
are better than others.

181
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:42,330
Do you remember
when we were young,

182
00:18:42,364 --> 00:18:43,966
we used to run around
all the time?

183
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,768
Things were different then.
We were free.

184
00:18:45,802 --> 00:18:47,235
We were always smiling.

185
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,939
I don't remember you smiling
while running away

186
00:18:49,972 --> 00:18:52,441
from that dog,
What was his name?

187
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:55,510
- That was George's dog, Tobias.
- Tobias.

188
00:18:55,544 --> 00:18:58,881
And every night your mom was
making soup for everyone.

189
00:18:58,915 --> 00:19:00,850
She was keeping us all warm.

190
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:07,990
All those good things
have been forgotten.

191
00:19:12,762 --> 00:19:13,863
Can we help you?

192
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:18,300
No, I'll pass for today,
I don't need a makeover.

193
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,535
[honking]

194
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:25,540
Oh wait actually,
can you help me?

195
00:19:25,574 --> 00:19:26,676
Can you help me hide?

196
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,314
Did you forget about
your grandmother?

197
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:35,550
No, I'm not the one
with Alzheimer's.

198
00:19:35,585 --> 00:19:36,619
I run every day.

199
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,656
Well please get in the car.
We need to get to the hospital.

200
00:19:41,124 --> 00:19:43,458
- But I'm all sweaty.
- Would you just get in?

201
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,362
[soft music playing]

202
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:56,873
Ms. Melody,

203
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:59,407
how do you like your
grandson's new look?

204
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:02,645
[Melody] Pretty.

205
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:06,548
Remember,
you're not on vacation.

206
00:20:07,315 --> 00:20:09,518
Yeah well there's nothing
but weeds here anyway.

207
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,588
What happened to all the corn?

208
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:14,757
I grow enough to feed
our animals but...

209
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:18,795
these fields used to grow enough
corn to feed the whole town.

210
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,429
Kept the whole town working too.

211
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:27,435
Your farm is really big.
Are you still in charge grandma?

212
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,538
Of course not,

213
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:31,607
Mary is.

214
00:20:44,086 --> 00:20:46,321
You help your grandmother
get inside.

215
00:20:46,756 --> 00:20:48,323
I'm gonna park the car.

216
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:08,678
Ms. Melody, good morning.

217
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:11,147
I've been waiting for you,
running a little late today.

218
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,480
I guess it's my fault.

219
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:14,349
Couldn't find an outfit?

220
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:16,484
It's a long story.

221
00:21:16,853 --> 00:21:18,654
And you are...?

222
00:21:18,688 --> 00:21:20,422
I'm Chris, her grandson.

223
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:22,625
The butler should be out there
parking the car.

224
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,895
OK, uh... that is for you.

225
00:21:27,763 --> 00:21:29,632
Oh, come on.

226
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:31,566
[distant screaming]

227
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:36,172
C'mon, c'mon, don't be like...
don't be like that.

228
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:39,609
Easy. Easy does it.
Calm down. Calm down.

229
00:21:39,642 --> 00:21:41,644
Easy. Shhh.

230
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:43,112
Oh. Hey, hey.

231
00:21:43,145 --> 00:21:45,615
Look... look who
just came to see you.

232
00:21:45,648 --> 00:21:48,050
Hey, you know, I suspect
you made all that noise

233
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:49,986
just to get her attention, huh?

234
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:52,788
[muttering]

235
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:55,691
He always calms down when
you come Ms. Melody, you see?

236
00:21:55,925 --> 00:21:59,427
- We are all here for you.
- That's right.

237
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,799
[panting]

238
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:14,010
Who was that patient?

239
00:22:14,744 --> 00:22:17,847
That was George,
he's your grandfather.

240
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:19,949
My grandfather?

241
00:22:20,316 --> 00:22:22,718
[scoffs] I didn't even know
I had one.

242
00:22:23,352 --> 00:22:26,188
There are probably many things
you don't know Chris.

243
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:30,726
Does she even remember him?

244
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,197
She may not remember his name
but you never forget love.

245
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:38,167
Will my grandma be like him?

246
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:40,736
George is very ill.

247
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,470
He's no longer independent,

248
00:22:42,504 --> 00:22:44,607
that's why we're keeping him
here under observation.

249
00:22:45,141 --> 00:22:46,508
On the contrary,

250
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:48,811
Ms. Melody's disease
is progressing

251
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:50,478
but at a much slower rate.

252
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,684
We feel that the therapies that
we're doing are really working.

253
00:22:54,717 --> 00:22:56,786
Is there cure for Alzheimer's?

254
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:00,122
[Doctor] No.

255
00:23:02,725 --> 00:23:05,895
But with science,
each day counts.

256
00:23:07,063 --> 00:23:08,831
Oh here he is.

257
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:10,800
I'm sorry doctor,
I was parking the car.

258
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:13,501
I'm glad you finally made it.

259
00:23:13,535 --> 00:23:15,738
There are certain things
I'd rather not deal with.

260
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:19,175
Well... these things concern
your grandmother.

261
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:21,476
[Doctor] Look at her.

262
00:23:22,244 --> 00:23:24,613
She's such a treasure.

263
00:23:30,052 --> 00:23:31,486
Hey!

264
00:23:33,823 --> 00:23:35,825
Finally!
We've been waiting for hours.

265
00:23:37,693 --> 00:23:39,061
Welcome to real America.

266
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:40,296
[Kim] Welcome to the middle
of nowhere.

267
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:41,731
[Jerry] Yeah my worst nightmare.

268
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:43,565
[Chris] I missed you guys.

269
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:45,001
We missed you too.

270
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:47,636
[laughing]
I missed you the most.

271
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,739
[grunting]

272
00:23:51,874 --> 00:23:53,609
[Kim] So,
what are we doing here?

273
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,111
[Jerry] Yeah please tell me
you've got a plan.

274
00:23:55,878 --> 00:23:57,847
- [Chris] What do you see?
- [Jerry] Nothing.

275
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:03,119
No,
you need to see the potential.

276
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:04,720
Don't you see it?

277
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:08,257
I see a way to get
our real island.

278
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:10,993
It turns out my beloved Grandma

279
00:24:11,027 --> 00:24:14,663
owns one of the largest
corn farms in the entire South.

280
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:18,134
[Jerry] Our island...

281
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,279
Truth doesn't exist.

282
00:24:31,814 --> 00:24:34,150
We create our own versions
of reality

283
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:36,185
that are all different
from each other.

284
00:24:36,952 --> 00:24:40,923
Welcome to Bluegrass
Farmers Bank & Trust.

285
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:44,860
And who do I have the pleasure
to speak with?

286
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:46,896
I'm Chris, Melody's grandson.

287
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:49,598
And this is Kim, my fiancée.

288
00:24:49,632 --> 00:24:52,168
In general, the mind
chooses what it wants to see,

289
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:53,869
but in a magic trick,

290
00:24:54,437 --> 00:24:56,839
it comes down to what I choose
to show you.

291
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:59,742
Well, I think what you're doing
for your grandmother

292
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:02,044
is admirable.

293
00:25:02,078 --> 00:25:03,813
'Cause it's all just
a confidence game.

294
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:07,817
It's all just a matter
of turning your attention

295
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,920
to something else while
I distract you from the trick.

296
00:25:10,953 --> 00:25:14,290
Well, howdy, folks!

297
00:25:14,323 --> 00:25:15,958
How are you doing?

298
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:21,063
Where is the manager of this
fine establishment?

299
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:25,067
Let me go take care of the...
that situation.

300
00:25:25,568 --> 00:25:29,238
[upbeat music playing]

301
00:25:32,942 --> 00:25:35,111
Well, now, see...
I hear you talking to me,

302
00:25:35,144 --> 00:25:37,646
and yet I still don't
have my problem fixed.

303
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,148
[Jerry] Alright?

304
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:40,382
What does it take to
get some help around here?

305
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:42,218
Well, congratulations.

306
00:25:43,953 --> 00:25:46,322
You've just been added
to Grandma's account.

307
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:50,226
Oh.

308
00:25:51,293 --> 00:25:53,762
Ah, oh boy.

309
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:56,665
Sorry for the interruption.

310
00:25:56,699 --> 00:25:59,201
Can you please just verify that
I've been added to the account?

311
00:25:59,235 --> 00:26:02,037
My lawyer in New York should
have already taken care of this.

312
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:05,241
[Manager]
You are on the account.

313
00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:12,181
But I still need Joe's signature
or Melody's password

314
00:26:12,982 --> 00:26:15,851
to give you access.

315
00:26:23,425 --> 00:26:25,761
[giggling]

316
00:26:28,264 --> 00:26:30,299
My grandson liked magic.

317
00:26:32,034 --> 00:26:33,335
He did tricks.

318
00:26:35,104 --> 00:26:38,040
Well, magic isn't real, so...

319
00:26:38,073 --> 00:26:39,942
Why do you say that, honey?

320
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:45,347
Cause happy endings
don't always happen.

321
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:49,118
Well, if it ain't happy,
it ain't the end.

322
00:26:51,387 --> 00:26:54,190
Hey grandma, what are
your favorite numbers?

323
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:57,126
Oh, definitely four.

324
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,761
[Chris] Do you have a password

325
00:26:58,794 --> 00:27:01,063
or a series
of numbers you remember?

326
00:27:01,096 --> 00:27:03,799
I really like eight.

327
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:10,339
But I really don't know if it's
really one of my favorites.

328
00:27:10,806 --> 00:27:12,741
Grandma, it's fine.

329
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:15,077
It's fine. All good.
Let's forget about this.

330
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:29,425
[Joe] Hey,
where have you been all day?

331
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:33,362
You know
I could have you arrested.

332
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:35,231
Hey Joe,

333
00:27:35,632 --> 00:27:38,934
my grandmother seems to really
like you and need you,

334
00:27:38,968 --> 00:27:41,337
and we're both very thankful
for what you do,

335
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,905
But let's just make something
clear:

336
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:45,241
You're just an employee.

337
00:27:45,274 --> 00:27:48,344
Yeah, and you should remember
why you're here.

338
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:58,287
Don't you ever get frustrated

339
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:01,123
when Melody
can't remember anything?

340
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:07,096
Look, she doesn't remember
certain things

341
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:11,867
but she remembers about
her family and the past.

342
00:28:13,202 --> 00:28:17,273
You see, Ms. Melody
is slowly disappearing.

343
00:28:18,608 --> 00:28:20,577
Alzheimer's disease
starts by making you

344
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,544
lose your short term memories,

345
00:28:22,945 --> 00:28:25,881
then you find yourself
not being able to dress,

346
00:28:26,348 --> 00:28:28,250
brush your teeth,
hold a fork,

347
00:28:28,752 --> 00:28:30,953
untill you become bedridden.

348
00:28:31,887 --> 00:28:34,957
You should pay more attention
to your grandmother.

349
00:28:35,592 --> 00:28:37,960
You might actually learn
something about her.

350
00:28:41,897 --> 00:28:43,565
Anyone for popcorn?

351
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,568
- My favorite as a kid.
- [Melody] I know silly.

352
00:28:48,003 --> 00:28:49,838
You're always in my prayers.

353
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:53,375
- You remember who I am?
- Of course I do.

354
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,578
You...

355
00:28:57,346 --> 00:28:58,881
You are you.

356
00:28:59,315 --> 00:29:03,919
- Are you sure?
- Well, who else could you be?

357
00:29:06,255 --> 00:29:07,356
[Jerry] Jesus!

358
00:29:08,057 --> 00:29:09,391
Exactly.

359
00:29:09,425 --> 00:29:11,360
And grandma
would do anything for him.

360
00:29:11,594 --> 00:29:16,198
[sighs] I think we need a bit
more of a traditional look.

361
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:19,335
Here we go, after all
he was born in Middle East.

362
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:22,004
[Kim] Maybe something
a little more classical.

363
00:29:22,037 --> 00:29:23,906
Oh c'mon, that's like
too far back in the days.

364
00:29:23,939 --> 00:29:25,007
That's a baby.

365
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:28,043
That's it! That's the one.

366
00:29:28,077 --> 00:29:29,646
- [Kim] That's the one.
- [Jerry] That is you.

367
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,513
I mean, look at resemblance.

368
00:29:31,547 --> 00:29:32,915
Yeah. OK, so,

369
00:29:33,449 --> 00:29:35,884
maybe you guys can
add a little magic touch,

370
00:29:35,918 --> 00:29:37,953
just to make it
a little more believable.

371
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:39,955
Maybe a like, a wig
or a costume?

372
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:43,292
While we're at it,
let's ask the local pastor

373
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:46,663
which verses of the Bible talk
specifically about money,

374
00:29:46,696 --> 00:29:48,530
wealth, will, generosity...

375
00:29:48,964 --> 00:29:50,366
And what are you gonna do?

376
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,267
This time,

377
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:53,969
I'll do the most difficult part.

378
00:29:54,436 --> 00:29:55,904
I'll get into the part.

379
00:29:59,108 --> 00:30:01,043
These are the only wigs
I've got for sale.

380
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:03,879
Um...

381
00:30:05,114 --> 00:30:06,515
How about that one?

382
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:10,386
You are pretty.

383
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:12,421
You have no reason to hide.

384
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:15,157
Oh, I was just...

385
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,659
Well, never mind about that.

386
00:30:16,693 --> 00:30:19,596
I loved dressing up in
these when I was a kid.

387
00:30:25,968 --> 00:30:27,302
[pounding]

388
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:34,143
- [Jerry grunts] Hello pastor.
- Hi.

389
00:30:35,077 --> 00:30:36,478
I need to find out which

390
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:41,116
chapters and verses of the bible
talk of generosity.

391
00:30:42,151 --> 00:30:43,218
You're getting a calling?

392
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,155
No. No, this is for Chris.

393
00:30:46,656 --> 00:30:49,391
Well you give your friend Chris
a message for me,

394
00:30:49,826 --> 00:30:51,661
it's important you tell him
that I'm here

395
00:30:51,694 --> 00:30:54,029
whenever he wants to speak.

396
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:08,377
I wish we could spend the rest
of our lives

397
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,712
not wearing any makeup.

398
00:31:11,714 --> 00:31:14,416
Just be us.

399
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,320
[laughs]

400
00:31:27,664 --> 00:31:28,964
How do I look?

401
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,401
Great.

402
00:31:33,469 --> 00:31:35,571
Oh, just in time.

403
00:31:36,505 --> 00:31:38,708
Costume's clean, and ready.

404
00:31:42,211 --> 00:31:46,014
Ah I don't know what to say.

405
00:31:46,348 --> 00:31:48,083
Me neither but hopefully

406
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:49,719
the Holy Ghost
will tell me soon.

407
00:31:56,058 --> 00:31:58,560
Proverbs 19:17.

408
00:31:58,595 --> 00:32:02,732
"He who gives to the poor
also lends to the Lord,

409
00:32:02,765 --> 00:32:05,534
and He will reward them
for what they have done."

410
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:08,705
I should give everything
to the poor.

411
00:32:08,738 --> 00:32:14,076
Indeed, Chris is poor,
very poor and he runs a charity

412
00:32:14,109 --> 00:32:17,312
to help other kids
who are poor just like him.

413
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,314
You should change your will.

414
00:32:19,348 --> 00:32:21,250
I know what you are after.

415
00:32:21,283 --> 00:32:23,085
[upbeat music playing]

416
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:45,574
It was mine.

417
00:32:47,242 --> 00:32:49,278
Could you take it to Mary?

418
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:52,715
[Joe] Ms. Melody.

419
00:32:53,081 --> 00:32:55,384
- Joe.
- [Joe] I'm home.

420
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,289
Yo! Why didn't you take
the necklace?

421
00:33:00,322 --> 00:33:01,858
It's gotta be worth at least
a couple of thousands.

422
00:33:01,891 --> 00:33:03,826
It's worth more.
It belonged to my mother.

423
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,460
[Joe] Ms. Melody? Where are you?

424
00:33:05,494 --> 00:33:07,462
Go, just go. Just go, just go!

425
00:33:07,496 --> 00:33:09,097
Wait, Kim. Kim, stay.

426
00:33:09,131 --> 00:33:10,733
- I need your help.
- Ok, ok.

427
00:33:12,234 --> 00:33:14,436
[screams]

428
00:33:14,469 --> 00:33:18,106
No, no, no. Hey. Hey. It's OK.

429
00:33:18,908 --> 00:33:20,710
That's a tough one to remember.

430
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:23,813
Hey, I think it goes like this,
right?

431
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,549
[humming]

432
00:33:42,632 --> 00:33:44,801
You're gonna need a lot of help
to fix this.

433
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:46,769
No.
You gotta help me with the plan.

434
00:33:46,803 --> 00:33:48,203
We have to make this work.

435
00:33:49,706 --> 00:33:53,175
- What's that?
- Hm. A chest?

436
00:34:04,787 --> 00:34:08,223
No, this is a treasure chest.

437
00:34:09,926 --> 00:34:11,861
[phone ringing]

438
00:34:20,737 --> 00:34:22,705
Yeah there's even
signal up here.

439
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:23,840
It's magic.

440
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,676
One of your lovers?

441
00:34:29,478 --> 00:34:30,713
It was my father.

442
00:34:34,617 --> 00:34:36,753
You know I never
got to meet mine.

443
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:43,926
Dads, who needs them.

444
00:34:44,861 --> 00:34:45,895
You got that right.

445
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:50,700
So to try get her to remember
the password,

446
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:54,302
we should try to make her
remember her past and family.

447
00:34:55,537 --> 00:34:57,305
We need to get in her mind.

448
00:35:05,715 --> 00:35:07,984
- I see you've already met.
- Oh yeah, she's already told us

449
00:35:08,017 --> 00:35:10,485
all the bad things about you.
[laughs]

450
00:35:13,422 --> 00:35:14,556
Do you know Mary?

451
00:35:18,728 --> 00:35:20,228
Alright I need to get going.

452
00:35:20,262 --> 00:35:21,898
I need to get
to the city hospital.

453
00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:23,265
No!

454
00:35:23,565 --> 00:35:24,867
It's alright,
it's nothing to worry about,

455
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:26,201
it's just a routine checkup.

456
00:35:27,536 --> 00:35:28,838
I want George.

457
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:32,441
I'm sorry Ms. Melody
I just can't take you today.

458
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:33,776
Please.

459
00:35:34,744 --> 00:35:36,846
Hey, we can take her.

460
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:39,782
After all, we're family.

461
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,621
Alright, I'm gonna leave
the car with you.

462
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:48,490
You do me a favor alright,

463
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:49,926
keep an eye on him for me,
please.

464
00:35:54,429 --> 00:35:56,699
- I'll be back in a little bit.
- Ok.

465
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,943
Oh honey, look what I found.

466
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,981
It's beautiful.

467
00:36:13,983 --> 00:36:17,019
Ms. Melody,
how nice to see you.

468
00:36:17,053 --> 00:36:19,055
Do we have a visit
scheduled for today?

469
00:36:19,088 --> 00:36:20,723
Grandma just
wanted to see George.

470
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,059
We're about
to have music therapy.

471
00:36:23,092 --> 00:36:24,627
I like music.

472
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,561
Do you still play piano?

473
00:36:26,996 --> 00:36:28,563
I play piano.

474
00:36:28,598 --> 00:36:31,399
Yes and so beautifully,
we would love it

475
00:36:31,433 --> 00:36:32,735
if you played for us.

476
00:36:33,102 --> 00:36:35,370
Oh no, no.

477
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:37,372
I'll meet you
in the common area.

478
00:36:38,975 --> 00:36:41,476
Come on, Grandma,
let's go see George.

479
00:36:49,018 --> 00:36:52,287
I think these patients need more
medicines than they do prayers.

480
00:36:53,022 --> 00:36:55,457
Well once you choose hope,
anything 's possible.

481
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,026
What is that some quote
from the bible?

482
00:36:57,459 --> 00:37:00,863
No. Actually, it comes
from Superman himself:

483
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:02,965
Mr. Christopher Reeve.

484
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:07,335
Let's go outside.
Oh, no, no. He can't.

485
00:37:07,703 --> 00:37:09,571
[Chris] But we can.

486
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:12,041
We just spoke to the doctor,
she said everything was fine.

487
00:37:13,475 --> 00:37:17,379
Well, if the doctor
gave her approval,

488
00:37:17,412 --> 00:37:18,480
who am I to say no?

489
00:37:22,652 --> 00:37:24,352
Can you find the missing one?

490
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,389
- Melody
- Um...

491
00:37:29,025 --> 00:37:30,525
George?

492
00:37:31,294 --> 00:37:33,596
Don't worry it's only missing,
but...

493
00:37:33,896 --> 00:37:35,832
look, it's right here.

494
00:37:43,906 --> 00:37:45,741
So what about my tip.

495
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,445
Well I-I-I can't find the key.

496
00:37:50,947 --> 00:37:52,447
What are you talking about?

497
00:37:53,515 --> 00:37:54,617
The key...

498
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:58,588
to the... safe.

499
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:01,757
[upbeat music playing]

500
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,684
Oh, look. Oh, Bach, look.

501
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:43,866
Yo, there is no key.

502
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,433
Yeah we looked everywhere.

503
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:46,669
So what 's the plan now?

504
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:48,004
I don't know, I'm out of ideas.

505
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:51,807
You know I could just disguise
myself as Joe

506
00:38:51,841 --> 00:38:53,009
and go back to the bank.

507
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:54,409
No, it's too risky.

508
00:38:55,912 --> 00:38:57,713
So I could just find
some dirt on Joe.

509
00:38:57,747 --> 00:38:59,982
I mean,
it can't be that difficult.

510
00:39:00,016 --> 00:39:01,784
What are you talking about?

511
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:04,687
Our main obstacle so far
has been the power of attorney.

512
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,789
Joe has it,
and he shouldn't it.

513
00:39:07,256 --> 00:39:08,724
It should rightfully
belong to Chris.

514
00:39:08,758 --> 00:39:10,726
Well what do you plan
to do then?

515
00:39:12,862 --> 00:39:15,031
You continue
with her emotional recall

516
00:39:15,064 --> 00:39:16,564
or whatever it is
you wanna call it

517
00:39:16,966 --> 00:39:18,701
and you leave the house to me.

518
00:39:19,602 --> 00:39:21,037
Are you you wanna do that?

519
00:39:22,038 --> 00:39:23,105
I got this.

520
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:26,441
[animals mooing]

521
00:40:13,122 --> 00:40:16,225
- Now I remember everything
- Nice Grandma.

522
00:40:16,524 --> 00:40:18,027
Hey, what do you remember?

523
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,963
How much I love
living on a farm.

524
00:40:28,004 --> 00:40:29,905
Do you all remember
when you were young and hip?

525
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:33,576
We're still young, and hip.

526
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:38,080
This is a nice store.

527
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:40,883
Well this salon belongs to you,
Ms. Melody.

528
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:42,618
I do your hair here every week.

529
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:46,122
Maybe we could
try a new hairstyle?

530
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:48,724
No, no,
let's go see Pastor John.

531
00:40:54,096 --> 00:40:56,699
You know from the side
you really do look like Jesus.

532
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:02,271
Do ever think about God
or what we're doing here.

533
00:41:03,372 --> 00:41:05,241
What,
are you becoming religious?

534
00:41:05,274 --> 00:41:07,943
No, I just... I don't know,

535
00:41:07,977 --> 00:41:10,946
sometimes I think about...
our purpose.

536
00:41:11,747 --> 00:41:13,716
[phone ringing]

537
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:17,887
Why don't you just talk to him?

538
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:22,658
What's the matter with you?

539
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:24,559
Not in the house of the lord.

540
00:41:24,994 --> 00:41:27,830
I'm sorry I wasn't going to
answer it anyway.

541
00:41:28,798 --> 00:41:29,832
It's his father.

542
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:32,168
He just doesn't want
to talk to him.

543
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:42,878
Pastor John.

544
00:41:44,013 --> 00:41:45,648
Pastor John,
what are you doing here?

545
00:41:45,681 --> 00:41:47,049
Shh.

546
00:41:47,283 --> 00:41:49,251
- Oh my God... Is she...
- Sh. No, no, no, no. It's OK.

547
00:41:49,285 --> 00:41:51,987
The doctor said it was just
normal tiredness.

548
00:41:52,021 --> 00:41:55,057
The kids probably forgot to give
her some water. Here.

549
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:59,295
You know, I told Chris
to watch out for her.

550
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:01,230
And he did.
And he meant well you know.

551
00:42:01,263 --> 00:42:04,200
I think it's time
for Ms. Melody to go out

552
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:06,635
and create some new memories...

553
00:42:07,103 --> 00:42:08,838
That she won't remember anyway.

554
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:10,139
Yeah but somebody will.

555
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,741
And they will cherish them.

556
00:42:13,642 --> 00:42:17,313
It is an experience worth more
than all the money in the world.

557
00:42:18,781 --> 00:42:20,082
Can I have my drink back now?

558
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,952
[laughing]

559
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,789
Did we really play
with the goats?

560
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:31,227
Yeah, and we still
smell like them.

561
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,697
[Chris bleats]
[Melody laughs]

562
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:35,898
Oh...

563
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:38,134
Well I'm happy.

564
00:42:38,534 --> 00:42:39,835
That's good grandma.

565
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:41,070
Don't scare us like that.

566
00:42:41,971 --> 00:42:43,739
What else makes you happy?

567
00:42:44,206 --> 00:42:46,842
Oh, barn dances

568
00:42:46,876 --> 00:42:48,711
and bobbing for apples.

569
00:42:49,879 --> 00:42:52,148
We had so much fun.

570
00:42:52,915 --> 00:42:56,318
Mama and Daddy would waltz
all around the floor.

571
00:42:56,919 --> 00:43:01,257
I had a new dress,
midnight blue.

572
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,162
Daddy spoiled me rotten,
mama said.

573
00:43:07,062 --> 00:43:11,800
At night
you could hear the corn grow.

574
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:18,974
You remind me of someone,
I just can't think who.

575
00:43:21,177 --> 00:43:23,078
We had a beautiful boy.

576
00:43:25,014 --> 00:43:27,149
I loved playing piano for him.

577
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:32,388
Sweet,
honest as the day is long.

578
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:35,824
Told me when he stole a cookie.

579
00:43:36,192 --> 00:43:37,726
[giggles]

580
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,296
Oh, he was so good.

581
00:43:42,097 --> 00:43:44,133
[Melody]
I wonder what happened to him.

582
00:43:53,776 --> 00:43:55,444
[piano playing]

583
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:10,526
I'm so happy that you decided
to bring Ms. Melody

584
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:12,828
to our music
therapy class today.

585
00:44:13,162 --> 00:44:14,997
She likes to make people happy.

586
00:44:15,264 --> 00:44:16,498
It shows.

587
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,338
You're doing great.

588
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,855
He's playing along
with Ms. Melody.

589
00:44:45,294 --> 00:44:46,829
Look, Ms. Melody,

590
00:44:48,163 --> 00:44:49,431
he wants to play.

591
00:44:58,507 --> 00:45:00,542
Hello. FBI.

592
00:45:01,277 --> 00:45:03,345
No, no,
there's no need to panic.

593
00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:07,149
My name is special agent Fox,
Nick Fox.

594
00:45:07,182 --> 00:45:09,084
I'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

595
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:13,322
Well what about? Mr. Agent Fox.

596
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:17,259
What do you know
about a man named Joe?

597
00:45:18,027 --> 00:45:21,997
Joe? Well, he takes good
care of Ms. Melody.

598
00:45:22,531 --> 00:45:25,134
Well, yes.
That's actually why I'm here.

599
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:27,403
The FBI is conducting
a special investigation

600
00:45:27,436 --> 00:45:32,574
to determine if he qualifies
for a social commitment award.

601
00:45:32,808 --> 00:45:34,243
That's a great idea!

602
00:45:34,678 --> 00:45:39,248
But it's a federal secret, OK?

603
00:45:40,149 --> 00:45:45,521
Well, that's about right, since
he's the original "secret man".

604
00:45:46,322 --> 00:45:47,389
How so?

605
00:45:47,856 --> 00:45:50,993
Well, he just dropped out of the
sky one day.

606
00:45:51,026 --> 00:45:53,862
He just appeared, like...
like Mary Poppins.

607
00:45:54,463 --> 00:45:56,365
But everybody in town likes him.
And...

608
00:45:56,999 --> 00:45:58,967
I think he deserves an award.

609
00:46:00,302 --> 00:46:01,370
Thank you.

610
00:46:02,605 --> 00:46:04,840
[piano playing]

611
00:46:12,682 --> 00:46:16,018
How can you live surrounded by
so much pain?

612
00:46:17,419 --> 00:46:19,088
It's not just pain.

613
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:30,866
[Pastor John] Awww.

614
00:46:32,669 --> 00:46:36,438
In John chapter twenty-one,
verse sixteen:

615
00:46:36,472 --> 00:46:39,875
Jesus told Peter
to "Feed my sheep".

616
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:41,477
Or rabbit!

617
00:46:42,244 --> 00:46:43,512
Where's Jerry?

618
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,048
Still looking for dirt on Joe.

619
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,221
Hey how you doing man?

620
00:46:52,589 --> 00:46:53,656
That'll do it.

621
00:46:55,257 --> 00:46:57,459
- Whoa! [grunts]
- I'm so sorry.

622
00:46:57,493 --> 00:46:58,560
- You alright?
- Oh yeah.

623
00:46:58,595 --> 00:47:00,095
Yeah I'm alright, you alright?

624
00:47:00,129 --> 00:47:02,364
- Yeah I'm great.
- You sure?

625
00:47:16,011 --> 00:47:18,013
Grandma, what are you doing up?

626
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:19,281
I can't sleep.

627
00:47:22,351 --> 00:47:24,052
Mary is not home yet.

628
00:47:31,026 --> 00:47:35,899
Here... take these,
whenever you're scared,

629
00:47:37,566 --> 00:47:40,502
- try to remember...
- What?

630
00:47:42,204 --> 00:47:43,439
that you're not alone.

631
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,401
Where are we?

632
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:15,270
This was the original farm
homestead.

633
00:48:15,304 --> 00:48:17,072
Your grandfather built it,

634
00:48:17,306 --> 00:48:19,742
it's been in the family
for generations.

635
00:48:29,084 --> 00:48:31,654
That's George, your husband.

636
00:48:33,656 --> 00:48:34,691
Do you remember?

637
00:48:36,225 --> 00:48:37,627
Of course I do.

638
00:48:39,194 --> 00:48:41,230
He's a hottie. [laughs]

639
00:48:43,332 --> 00:48:45,000
My Mary.

640
00:48:48,203 --> 00:48:49,772
This is where she got married.

641
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:52,574
Right here at the cabin.

642
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:55,043
Something happened.

643
00:48:57,179 --> 00:48:59,147
They put me in the hospital,

644
00:49:01,149 --> 00:49:03,519
and a little boy got lost.

645
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:10,492
What happened to the boy?

646
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:16,431
- Oh Joe.
- It's alright.

647
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,101
- Joe...
- It's alright, Ms. Melody.

648
00:49:30,546 --> 00:49:34,082
Who is that lady? Who is she?

649
00:49:34,116 --> 00:49:35,350
Ma'am, calm down.

650
00:49:36,686 --> 00:49:38,821
Why is she staring at me?

651
00:49:40,222 --> 00:49:42,424
Why does she have that sad face?

652
00:49:42,457 --> 00:49:46,194
Oh, c'mon. It's time to go.
No. No!

653
00:49:46,228 --> 00:49:47,764
And who are you?

654
00:49:47,797 --> 00:49:50,165
What are you
trying to do to me?

655
00:49:50,198 --> 00:49:52,167
Tell me. Tell me!

656
00:49:52,802 --> 00:49:54,336
It's alright.

657
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:57,472
What are you doing?
Tell me. Tell me!

658
00:49:57,506 --> 00:50:02,144
No! No. C'mon.
Shhh. It's OK. It's OK.

659
00:50:02,177 --> 00:50:06,214
[crying]

660
00:50:34,777 --> 00:50:36,445
Hi, yeah... Melody's house.

661
00:50:37,947 --> 00:50:42,752
No, Joe is not here...
OK, I... I understand.

662
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:05,407
[whimpering]

663
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:33,870
Don't you all cry for me
when I go.

664
00:51:36,538 --> 00:51:40,743
Nothing lasts forever.
Leaving is part of life.

665
00:51:41,744 --> 00:51:44,781
You'll leave too when you're
done serving your sentence.

666
00:51:45,848 --> 00:51:49,184
You know, it's hardest
for those left behind.

667
00:51:49,986 --> 00:51:52,655
But George is in
a much better place.

668
00:51:59,294 --> 00:52:01,229
I see this every day,

669
00:52:01,864 --> 00:52:04,934
but you never,
you never get used to it.

670
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:11,506
I wanna... pray.

671
00:52:11,808 --> 00:52:13,375
Play.

672
00:52:14,143 --> 00:52:17,412
Yes, let 's play,
let's play Ms. Melody, c'mon.

673
00:52:22,885 --> 00:52:24,954
We are gonna play,
We are gonna play.

674
00:52:29,424 --> 00:52:31,994
We are gathered here today
to remember George,

675
00:52:33,361 --> 00:52:35,598
and to celebrate his life.

676
00:52:38,901 --> 00:52:43,740
Ashes to ashes.
We return to where we began:

677
00:52:44,573 --> 00:52:46,843
Innocent and free.

678
00:52:47,309 --> 00:52:50,646
George will always live
in our memories.

679
00:52:58,855 --> 00:53:01,958
"For everything
there's a reason,

680
00:53:02,658 --> 00:53:06,394
and a time for every
matter under heaven:

681
00:53:07,597 --> 00:53:12,434
A time to be born,
and a time to die;

682
00:53:12,969 --> 00:53:15,738
a time to plant,

683
00:53:16,338 --> 00:53:19,909
and a time to pluck up
what is planted."

684
00:53:21,911 --> 00:53:25,615
Ecclesiastes
three: one-two.

685
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,340
Hey Joe.

686
00:54:02,051 --> 00:54:03,418
My condolences.

687
00:54:09,491 --> 00:54:10,559
Now,

688
00:54:11,194 --> 00:54:13,629
I'm confident you'll give the
power of attorney to Chris

689
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:15,665
first thing in the morning.

690
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:20,703
Otherwise everyone 's gonna
know your little secret.

691
00:55:01,644 --> 00:55:02,879
We need to talk.

692
00:55:04,146 --> 00:55:05,413
[Melody] Play tricks.

693
00:55:06,548 --> 00:55:07,817
We're all here.

694
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,021
We're not all here.

695
00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:15,658
We can't change the past.

696
00:55:17,026 --> 00:55:19,494
- I am my past.
- That's your choice.

697
00:55:19,929 --> 00:55:21,998
That's my choice, really?

698
00:55:22,031 --> 00:55:23,766
This is a choice?

699
00:55:24,499 --> 00:55:27,036
You don't know anything about
what I've been through.

700
00:55:27,603 --> 00:55:30,106
You don't know anything
about me.

701
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:31,741
Are you sure about that?

702
00:55:32,608 --> 00:55:34,977
Did you really think you could
fool anyone,

703
00:55:35,011 --> 00:55:36,712
me or the bank manager?

704
00:55:37,146 --> 00:55:38,714
We've all been here for you.

705
00:55:39,115 --> 00:55:40,917
We're trying to help you.

706
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:44,987
You had the courage to complain
about your father so much.

707
00:55:46,188 --> 00:55:47,489
My father?

708
00:55:48,858 --> 00:55:51,027
I hate my father.

709
00:55:51,761 --> 00:55:57,133
He killed my mom and to me,
he's dead, too.

710
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:00,903
Have the courage to call him

711
00:56:01,804 --> 00:56:03,471
and tell him how you feel,

712
00:56:05,074 --> 00:56:06,709
before it's too late.

713
00:57:15,711 --> 00:57:17,847
[phone dialing]

714
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:22,752
[ringing]

715
00:57:25,955 --> 00:57:28,024
[ringing]

716
00:57:29,792 --> 00:57:32,261
[Joe's phone ringing]

717
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:36,132
[Joe's phone ringing]

718
00:57:41,937 --> 00:57:43,706
[Joe] After I got out of prison,

719
00:57:46,709 --> 00:57:48,310
I read in the newspaper that

720
00:57:48,344 --> 00:57:50,212
your grandma was looking
for some help.

721
00:57:52,915 --> 00:57:55,217
See, for all those years,
behind bars,

722
00:57:56,852 --> 00:57:58,954
all I could think
about was your mother.

723
00:58:01,257 --> 00:58:02,591
The accident.

724
00:58:04,894 --> 00:58:07,029
All the pain that I had caused.

725
00:58:09,131 --> 00:58:11,033
Prison wasn't enough...

726
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:14,236
Getting sober wasn't enough.

727
00:58:15,738 --> 00:58:17,606
I had to make it up somehow.

728
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:22,278
So I changed my identity,
you know?

729
00:58:22,745 --> 00:58:24,713
I changed my whole life.

730
00:58:26,382 --> 00:58:28,918
And I decided I would take care
of my mother-in-law,

731
00:58:28,951 --> 00:58:30,086
your grandmother.

732
00:58:31,687 --> 00:58:32,855
This whole time,

733
00:58:33,556 --> 00:58:36,092
you've talked
about honesty and respect,

734
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:38,994
but look who's talking.

735
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:42,832
To me,
you were nothing then,

736
00:58:45,267 --> 00:58:46,769
and you're nothing now.

737
00:59:08,224 --> 00:59:10,392
[soft music playing]

738
00:59:40,456 --> 00:59:45,327
[whimpering] Oh God.

739
00:59:58,274 --> 01:00:02,044
[dramatic music playing]

740
01:00:43,052 --> 01:00:46,055
Joe... Joe!

741
01:00:47,423 --> 01:00:52,761
Joe... Joe, Joe.

742
01:00:53,095 --> 01:00:56,865
Joe! Help, help!

743
01:01:55,257 --> 01:01:56,392
Are you alright son?

744
01:01:58,327 --> 01:01:59,895
Am I your son, too?

745
01:02:02,164 --> 01:02:04,500
So, you found out.

746
01:02:05,467 --> 01:02:07,136
Everybody knew... but me?

747
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:11,173
I'm the one who married your mom
and your dad.

748
01:02:11,473 --> 01:02:12,875
You're kidding.

749
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:18,147
Well, I do have a certain age,
you know.

750
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:21,016
And I even could've married
Melody and George.

751
01:02:21,984 --> 01:02:23,252
He was a great man, you know?

752
01:02:24,654 --> 01:02:26,121
I'm so lost.

753
01:02:30,259 --> 01:02:32,261
You need to have faith, son.

754
01:02:32,995 --> 01:02:36,432
There cannot be light without
darkness. Don't forget.

755
01:02:38,334 --> 01:02:40,502
- What's faith?
- Faith?

756
01:02:43,138 --> 01:02:44,840
Faith is a choice you make.

757
01:02:45,709 --> 01:02:48,143
You need to have faith that
all of this is worth it.

758
01:02:49,511 --> 01:02:51,113
In order for that to happen,

759
01:02:53,115 --> 01:02:54,617
you need to have faith
in yourself.

760
01:02:58,187 --> 01:02:59,589
- Chris.
- Kim?

761
01:03:00,356 --> 01:03:02,091
- Your father he...
- I already know.

762
01:03:03,425 --> 01:03:04,627
That's not what I meant.

763
01:03:06,528 --> 01:03:08,130
We took him to hospital.

764
01:03:17,172 --> 01:03:18,874
He lied this whole time.

765
01:03:21,377 --> 01:03:23,312
He spent so many years
of his life

766
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:25,080
trying to make it up
to his mother-in-law,

767
01:03:26,315 --> 01:03:28,484
- because of...
- You can say it:

768
01:03:30,219 --> 01:03:31,553
Because he killed my mom.

769
01:03:32,689 --> 01:03:34,456
You know it was an accident.

770
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:37,493
He put the most
important thing first.

771
01:03:37,526 --> 01:03:39,027
He put family first.

772
01:03:42,998 --> 01:03:44,500
I just don't think
he forgave himself.

773
01:03:53,475 --> 01:03:56,245
Joe's heart
is beginning to fail.

774
01:03:58,447 --> 01:03:59,515
What's wrong with it?

775
01:04:00,249 --> 01:04:01,950
He didn't tell you?

776
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:05,287
He's needed surgery
for a long time,

777
01:04:05,588 --> 01:04:08,090
and now he's getting
beyond the time limit for that.

778
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:10,092
Why didn't he do it?

779
01:04:11,093 --> 01:04:12,961
He refused treatment.

780
01:04:12,995 --> 01:04:15,197
As long as we can get him
transferred

781
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:16,733
to a specialized center,

782
01:04:16,766 --> 01:04:20,469
where a new heart is available,
there is still hope.

783
01:04:22,337 --> 01:04:24,239
We'll get him through this.

784
01:04:46,495 --> 01:04:47,730
Where's Joe?

785
01:04:49,031 --> 01:04:51,935
Don't worry,
he's being monitored.

786
01:04:52,669 --> 01:04:54,069
Let's just go to bed.

787
01:05:06,749 --> 01:05:09,652
- Chris.
- Yeah?

788
01:05:12,454 --> 01:05:14,156
Do you remember that time,

789
01:05:15,524 --> 01:05:17,192
you gave me pneumonia?

790
01:05:20,128 --> 01:05:21,330
Yeah.

791
01:05:23,465 --> 01:05:28,771
Because you made us stand
all night in the rain.

792
01:05:31,774 --> 01:05:33,542
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

793
01:05:35,645 --> 01:05:38,781
[scoffs] I don't know why
I listen to you.

794
01:05:43,853 --> 01:05:45,153
I don't know either.

795
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:58,668
We've had some good times.

796
01:05:59,101 --> 01:06:03,372
Yeah. Yeah, we have.

797
01:06:29,231 --> 01:06:30,767
Most ridiculous outfit?

798
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:41,711
Remember that time,

799
01:06:43,245 --> 01:06:44,581
- Sexy cop!
- I knew it!

800
01:06:44,614 --> 01:06:46,148
- Bachelorette party.
- Yeah.

801
01:06:47,149 --> 01:06:48,483
I stole their hearts.

802
01:06:51,486 --> 01:06:52,689
So ridiculous.

803
01:07:01,831 --> 01:07:03,565
We're kings of the island.

804
01:07:07,569 --> 01:07:08,838
Yeah...

805
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:11,641
Yeah we are.

806
01:07:12,307 --> 01:07:15,177
Now and forever.

807
01:07:18,547 --> 01:07:19,649
Yeah.

808
01:07:27,389 --> 01:07:29,892
And we're family, Chris...

809
01:07:32,294 --> 01:07:33,362
Right?

810
01:07:35,665 --> 01:07:36,766
Yeah.

811
01:07:41,871 --> 01:07:43,171
When are we going home?

812
01:07:43,973 --> 01:07:47,910
[sweet music playing]

813
01:08:26,816 --> 01:08:29,217
Grandma,
what are you doing up?

814
01:08:30,953 --> 01:08:32,454
This is for scared.

815
01:08:34,389 --> 01:08:36,425
Joe'll be fine,
you won't be alone.

816
01:08:36,458 --> 01:08:38,828
No, no, you.

817
01:08:41,764 --> 01:08:44,366
Who will look after you
when we're gone?

818
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:50,940
Grandma...

819
01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:56,378
I've never asked you this but...

820
01:09:01,283 --> 01:09:02,451
How's Mary?

821
01:09:02,919 --> 01:09:06,354
Mary... Mary's fine.

822
01:09:10,425 --> 01:09:11,928
Did you see her?

823
01:09:28,845 --> 01:09:32,882
[sweet music playing]

824
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,864
Oh! Look what I found, honey.

825
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:05,067
Ah. It looks like you made it.

826
01:12:13,109 --> 01:12:14,409
Are you ready?

827
01:12:22,517 --> 01:12:28,658
Ah Mr. Gibson,
I need you to insert your key.

828
01:12:38,868 --> 01:12:39,969
Mr. Gibson?

829
01:12:47,143 --> 01:12:48,978
[phone ringing]

830
01:12:59,521 --> 01:13:01,489
[upbeat music playing]

831
01:13:51,974 --> 01:13:53,109
I gotta go.

832
01:13:54,877 --> 01:13:56,112
I know.

833
01:13:57,713 --> 01:13:59,148
Are you ever coming back?

834
01:14:09,058 --> 01:14:10,558
The big day has arrived.

835
01:14:11,027 --> 01:14:12,695
They're gonna transfer you
to the city hospital

836
01:14:12,728 --> 01:14:13,996
for your surgery.

837
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:15,563
How's Ms. Melody?

838
01:14:15,598 --> 01:14:17,333
She's doing just fine.

839
01:14:17,366 --> 01:14:19,735
Chris is taking really
good care of her.

840
01:14:20,002 --> 01:14:22,638
It's you we need
to take care of now mister.

841
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:28,611
Everything's ready.
It's time to go.

842
01:14:31,313 --> 01:14:33,682
It's a forget me not.

843
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:37,086
It's a beautiful necklace.

844
01:14:39,655 --> 01:14:41,824
It's very special.

845
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:45,761
My husband gave it to me,
I think.

846
01:14:48,964 --> 01:14:50,232
And you gave it to Mary.

847
01:14:51,901 --> 01:14:53,302
It was Mom's.

848
01:14:54,003 --> 01:14:55,137
Was?

849
01:14:56,739 --> 01:14:58,107
Yes grandma.

850
01:15:02,745 --> 01:15:03,813
Mom is dead.

851
01:15:05,247 --> 01:15:06,649
Really?

852
01:15:09,385 --> 01:15:12,254
- Yes.
- I see her.

853
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:18,127
I see her in you.

854
01:15:19,929 --> 01:15:21,831
She lives in you.

855
01:15:26,202 --> 01:15:27,703
This is yours.

856
01:15:29,271 --> 01:15:31,307
This is yours.

857
01:15:36,078 --> 01:15:39,949
Please, don't ever forget.

858
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:52,761
Oh, hey. The house looks nice
and fresh, brand new.

859
01:15:53,229 --> 01:15:55,030
We're headed to the city
hospital right now.

860
01:15:55,064 --> 01:15:56,765
You tell Joe,
when he wakes up,

861
01:15:57,366 --> 01:16:00,102
that next Sunday I'm gonna be
preaching the prodigal son.

862
01:16:00,136 --> 01:16:02,104
Bring him back home safely.

863
01:16:02,538 --> 01:16:05,141
- Thank you, Pastor John.
- You be careful. C'mon.

864
01:16:18,854 --> 01:16:21,423
Mr. Gibson, where are you?

865
01:16:21,457 --> 01:16:24,226
<i>You were supposed to be in cout
this morning.</i>

866
01:16:24,628 --> 01:16:27,296
<i>Aren't you back
in New York City yet?</i>

867
01:16:27,329 --> 01:16:30,399
I'm sorry. I have something more
important to take care of right now.

868
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:35,971
Mr. Gibson, I have only one
question for you:

869
01:16:37,373 --> 01:16:39,275
what makes all the difference?

870
01:16:39,742 --> 01:16:41,710
It's a familiar feeling.

871
01:16:42,411 --> 01:16:45,347
It's something that I forgot
but not really

872
01:16:45,781 --> 01:16:48,717
something I couldn't remember
that I had but

873
01:16:50,119 --> 01:16:52,421
I know I don't really make any
sense but

874
01:16:53,856 --> 01:16:54,990
you know what I mean?

875
01:16:55,691 --> 01:16:59,762
Yes,
I know exactly what you mean.

876
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:02,064
[Judge]
<i>And I wish you luck.</i>

877
01:17:02,097 --> 01:17:05,267
- Ah! Free!
- Oh. I'm free! Oh my... Grandma!

878
01:17:11,373 --> 01:17:13,275
Will you find out what floor
he's on?

879
01:17:13,309 --> 01:17:14,910
Joe?

880
01:17:15,344 --> 01:17:17,346
- Oh. Where are you going?
- We need to see Mr. Gibson.

881
01:17:17,379 --> 01:17:19,882
- He's in Intensive Care.
- Visiting hours are over.

882
01:17:20,416 --> 01:17:21,850
Come back tomorrow.

883
01:17:23,018 --> 01:17:24,954
- Grandma, are you OK?
- Melody?

884
01:17:24,987 --> 01:17:26,455
Look, my grandma is fainting!

885
01:17:26,488 --> 01:17:27,957
- My grandma is fainting!
- Code blue, main entrance.

886
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:29,825
I repeat: Code blue,
main entrance.

887
01:17:43,138 --> 01:17:45,908
- Grandma, are you okay?
- Oh...

888
01:17:46,475 --> 01:17:48,077
Stop, please.

889
01:17:48,944 --> 01:17:50,879
I feel much better.

890
01:17:53,349 --> 01:17:55,217
It's OK. I got this.

891
01:18:00,356 --> 01:18:02,157
Thank you very much!

892
01:18:10,432 --> 01:18:13,569
Hi.
We're looking for Mr. Gibson.

893
01:18:13,603 --> 01:18:15,070
He's...

894
01:18:17,539 --> 01:18:19,074
He's my father.

895
01:18:19,108 --> 01:18:22,011
Room 215,
at the end of that hallway.

896
01:18:35,625 --> 01:18:36,959
Joe.

897
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:45,467
You're a good man.

898
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:49,872
Don't you forget.

899
01:18:59,081 --> 01:19:00,316
Chris...

900
01:19:03,052 --> 01:19:04,186
Dad.

901
01:19:07,089 --> 01:19:08,324
I'm sorry.

902
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,393
I just didn't know how to...

903
01:19:16,332 --> 01:19:21,170
Believe me, I never forgot you.

904
01:19:26,008 --> 01:19:27,443
Surgery is gonna go well.

905
01:19:32,147 --> 01:19:33,415
We're all here for you.

906
01:19:38,688 --> 01:19:40,556
Just make sure you
recover quick,

907
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:45,127
'cause we gotta go.

908
01:19:46,362 --> 01:19:47,529
Go?

909
01:19:49,599 --> 01:19:51,367
Where?

910
01:19:54,536 --> 01:19:56,071
Home.

911
01:20:08,718 --> 01:20:11,520
In the end, Melody was right:

912
01:20:12,154 --> 01:20:14,990
It was enough nurturing,
giving water,

913
01:20:15,023 --> 01:20:17,694
and taking care of
what's important... with love,

914
01:20:17,727 --> 01:20:20,129
day after day.

915
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:23,465
Grandma's farm started to run
again,

916
01:20:23,499 --> 01:20:25,367
and I decided to use it

917
01:20:25,401 --> 01:20:27,903
to give life to a project
I'm very fond of.

918
01:20:30,038 --> 01:20:32,107
The moments we share
bring us close,

919
01:20:32,374 --> 01:20:34,476
give us meaning and purpose,

920
01:20:35,144 --> 01:20:36,311
make us happy...

921
01:20:36,945 --> 01:20:42,184
and become memories
for most of us, unforgettable.

922
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:51,661
Without realizing it,

923
01:20:51,694 --> 01:20:55,063
Melody turned my entire world
upside down.

924
01:20:55,732 --> 01:20:59,301
She taught me love...
and the magic of life.

925
01:21:00,169 --> 01:21:01,704
She brought people together.

926
01:21:02,137 --> 01:21:04,406
And she changed all of us.

927
01:21:04,641 --> 01:21:06,008
Forever.

928
01:21:07,509 --> 01:21:09,211
She'll always be part of us.

929
01:21:09,545 --> 01:21:12,649
She'll always be... remembered.

930
01:21:13,282 --> 01:21:15,083
Thanks to her,

931
01:21:15,117 --> 01:21:17,419
I found the real treasure
everyone was talking about.

932
01:21:18,454 --> 01:21:20,422
It's important we do our best...

933
01:21:21,523 --> 01:21:23,091
Not to forget.

934
01:21:24,627 --> 01:21:27,429
