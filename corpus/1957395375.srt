703
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:26,819
and he was always friendly.

704
01:04:26,852 --> 01:04:31,724
We flirted some,
and he started coming more after that.

705
01:04:31,757 --> 01:04:34,861

and that was it.

- Your hair. Ponytail.

708

Lose it. Take it down.

709
01:04:43,535 --> 01:04:44,938
Why?

710
01:04:44,971 --> 01:04:47,306
Well, because you slept with my
husband, and I'm asking you nicely.

Really?

730
01:05:48,834 --> 01:05:50,469
Yes. And I looked
on his computer,

731
01:05:50,502 --> 01:05:52,337
and there are
tons of pictures,

732
01:05:52,371 --> 01:05:53,705

733

They all look a little bit like
me, but not quite.

734
01:05:56,042 --> 01:05:57,977

with someone...

is gonna help you right now.

Am I not being clear?
He had a secret life.

745

stand there and lecture me

you should know.

after I was getting off,

826
01:11:54,699 --> 01:11:58,204
and he invited me here,
like a... like a day trip.

01:11:58,237 --> 01:11:59,939
And normally,
I wouldn't have gone,

828
01:11:59,972 --> 01:12:03,576
but he was smart,
and sweet, and...

829
01:12:03,609 --> 01:12:08,414
I don't know. I just kind of
felt safe with him, you know?

he took me here

and, uh, we had a drink.

834
01:12:18,191 --> 01:12:21,360

and he showed me the other house...

835
01:12:21,394 --> 01:12:24,230
Wait. You've seen it?

836
01:12:24,263 --> 01:12:28,401
Well, it's not much to see,
but he was really proud of it, though.

837

I mean, giddy, almost.

838
01:12:29,834 --> 01:12:32,138
Showing me around
from room to room.

839
01:12:32,171 --> 01:12:36,409
And then, he showed me this weird
statue, and he asked me to hold it.

840
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:39,478
And you did?

841
01:12:41,414 --> 01:12:44,350
What exactly did he
do to you?

842

843
01:12:52,824 --> 01:12:54,826
He held me...

844
01:12:55,695 --> 01:12:57,129
sort of.

845
01:12:57,163 --> 01:13:02,201
He put his chin
on my shoulder and...

846
01:13:02,235 --> 01:13:05,238
Look, I know it sounds weird
saying it out loud,

847
01:13:05,271 --> 01:13:06,838
but at the time,

848
01:13:06,872 --> 01:13:09,108
it felt really nice.

close to you.

I...

852
01:13:17,883 --> 01:13:19,552
I felt him shake.

853
01:13:19,585 --> 01:13:24,390
And he was crying a little,
and I didn't know what to do.

854
01:13:24,423 --> 01:13:26,259
What did he do to you?

855
01:13:26,292 --> 01:13:30,829
I kissed him.
He kissed me back and...

856
01:13:31,731 --> 01:13:34,200
It was very sweet at first.

857
01:13:36,202 --> 01:13:37,903
So, I... I...

858
01:13:39,472 --> 01:13:42,774
didn't stop him when he
put his hands on my back.

859
01:13:44,343 --> 01:13:47,346
And I didn't stop him when
he put his hands on my neck.

860
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:50,716
Until he
started squeezing.

861
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:53,419
Oh, my God.

862
01:13:53,452 --> 01:13:56,389
I probably misread him,
you know? I just...

863
01:13:56,422 --> 01:13:59,892
Everybody has a different
barometer for that kind of thing.

864
01:13:59,925 --> 01:14:01,627
Did he hurt you?

865
01:14:01,661 --> 01:14:03,562
God, no!

866
01:14:03,596 --> 01:14:05,631
I asked him to stop,
and he stopped.

867
01:14:05,665 --> 01:14:07,400
But do you think
he would have?

868
01:14:07,433 --> 01:14:08,800
But he didn't.

869
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:10,703
He drove me home.

870
01:14:10,736 --> 01:14:14,006
He said it was his fault,
not mine.

871
01:14:14,874 --> 01:14:17,076
That he was
tired and confused,

872
01:14:17,109 --> 01:14:19,811
and he didn't know
what was him,

873
01:14:19,844 --> 01:14:23,516
and it wasn't
working anymore.

874
01:14:24,684 --> 01:14:27,953
He was afraid
he couldn't hold it back.

875
01:14:27,987 --> 01:14:29,555
Hold what back?

876
01:14:29,588 --> 01:14:31,857
I don't know exactly.

877
01:14:31,891 --> 01:14:33,793
But in the end,

878
01:14:33,825 --> 01:14:36,595

what he had to do.
