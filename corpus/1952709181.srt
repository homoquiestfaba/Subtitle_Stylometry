00:00:06,087 --> 00:00:07,600
READY TO RUN

2
00:00:08,767 --> 00:00:09,882
Where is the microphone?

3
00:00:10,047 --> 00:00:11,639
I am wearing, Bob?

4
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:14,605
I was called
disaster in the White House.

5
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:16,644
I had an appointment
with a guy tonight ...

6
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:18,559
We are ready?

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,558
And my teeth?

8
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,801
It turns ...

9
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:29,084
Hello. Signed by Bullwinkel
on the roof of the White House ...

10
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:32,563
where run
very strange rumors.

11
00:00:32,727 --> 00:00:37,278
The President would have been eaten
by a sort of giant flying nose ...

12
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:44,685
There was a ceremony honoring
Jensen, astronaut disappeared

13
00:00:44,847 --> 00:00:46,883
and then everything went wrong ...

14
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,400
My hair!

15
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:49,238
What is ...

16
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:53,195
Looks like a gadget space
Giant has just landed.

17
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:56,039
I shall approach ...

18
00:00:57,167 --> 00:01:00,477
Excuse me, I'm on TV.

19
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:05,679
I see a door that opens

20
00:01:05,847 --> 00:01:10,079
and soldiers
encircling the capsule.

21
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:20,403
A cute little squirrel comes
out of this strange spaceship.

22
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:27,402
I do not know what happens ...
It's hell!

23
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:32,165
Do not do it ...
it's my producer!

24
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:37,206
My cameraman is dead!

25
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:39,846
How long ...

26
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:42,285
I'll shoot!

00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:27,478
Good luck, Earl.

30
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:29,239
Thank you Dr. Frubar.

31
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:30,726
Dad.

32
00:06:22,327 --> 00:06:25,046
Goodbye, Josie. I love you.

33
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:32,206
Goodbye, Dad.

Fire!

40
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,719
Successful ejection. It is in orbit.

41
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,326
EJECTION OF FUEL

42
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:41,362
Control station, the dial
indicates a fuel leak.

43
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,523
It was she who supported
button!

44
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:46,005
Remove this girl away.

45
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,843
Let me go!

46
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:05,237
This is not me!

47
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:07,119
Let me go!

Earl, by Dr. F.

49
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:14,276
As you can see,

50
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:16,677
- You're dry.
- How?

51
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:21,597
I fear that Josie has pressed
the eject button on the fuel.

52
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,519
We try to find a solution.

53
00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:31,566
Send help!

54
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:37,247
Impossible, Earl.
Here's the situation.

55
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:38,806
You can not save you.

56
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:41,202
Open your secret pocket.

00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,158
Here Earl Jensen
from interplanetary space.

59
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:00,246
Hello, America,

60
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:01,999
My name is Earl Jensen.

61
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:07,640
I learned that I have no
fuel and I can not

62
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:09,405
return to Earth.

63
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:12,280
But do not pity me.
It is an honor

64
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:14,486
to give his life

65
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:15,722
for his country.

66
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:18,440
Now the flag.

67
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:25,720
The great visionary leader

00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:27,286
Dr. Frubar,

69
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:31,235
did everything
in his power to save me.

70
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:34,485
Under his leadership demanding
and stimulating

71
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:37,601
we will continue
conquer and control

72
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,600
interplanetary space.

73
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,318
You can do something.

74
00:10:42,487 --> 00:10:45,479
If we had enough money
for our operations,

75
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:48,924
I would have been safe
in space ...

76
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:53,558
So please, open
your hearts and wallets.

77
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:57,123
Send your contribution
Department of Space.

78
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:03,477

like this will not happen again.

79
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:07,604
Wait ... I see ...

80
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,756
I almost.

81
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:13,043
Goodbye. God will sell out.

82
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:16,557
Earl is "God bless you" ...
Damn!

83
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:23,724
What a terrible tragedy ...

84
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:26,647

87
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:38,678
I will return, Dr. Frubar.
You can count on.

89
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:50,123

I'm supposed to work.

But then Josie,
we love.

91
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:57,006
Josie, has a good time.
Think of your reputation.

92
00:13:57,167 --> 00:14:01,524
Josie, enjoying life.
It is so short.

93
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,685
This is the way
of evil and sin ...

94
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:05,723
Listen to your heart,

95
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:09,124

96
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:11,243

"Save yourself, be wise!"

Listen to me, Josie. I know what
is best for you and your dear soul.

if the milk is free.

- A new sun?
- A new planet?

It is a unique opportunity.

167
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,000
Who wants to take a percentage?

168
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:39,645
Dr. F. here Tomkins, radar.

169
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:41,485
Hopefully it's important.

170
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:45,646
We have identified a meteorite.
He heads back to Earth.

171
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:46,996

172
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,039

Yes, why?

178
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:13,243
Because it has a green tail!

179
00:21:13,447 --> 00:21:14,846
And then?

180
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:16,002
Yes, so what?

181
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:18,562
The green tail indicates
the presence of metal.

182
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:19,836
And then?

183
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:20,797
And then?

184
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:24,283
This is the spacecraft
my father! Stop it!

185
00:21:24,487 --> 00:21:27,684

I repeat, do not quit!

186
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:34,477
If you do that,
you're fired!

187
00:21:50,847 --> 00:21:51,836
I'm waiting!

188
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:54,766
Are you kidding me?

189
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:56,286
I'm hosting my father!

190
00:21:59,247 --> 00:22:00,680
Wait for me!

191
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:12,326
Where is he?

192
00:22:12,487 --> 00:22:14,523
There has to follow the trail.

193
00:22:15,407 --> 00:22:18,319
Sinners!
You can not ignore Jesus!

194
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:23,080
You can not forget Jesus!
You can not live without Jesus!

195
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:24,475
It's impossible, impossible!

196
00:22:39,047 --> 00:22:42,244
No, you can not!
You can not!

197
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:54,918
We can not fight with Jesus!

198
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:56,640
Can not
and we will not!

199
00:22:56,847 --> 00:22:58,326
We can not fight with Jesus!

200
00:22:58,527 --> 00:23:00,119
This is the way to hell!

201
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:03,645
1st ... Press the mushroom!
2nd ... It goes too fast!

202
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:07,159
3rd ... It will fly!
4e ... Say goodbye!

203
00:23:17,327 --> 00:23:20,842
You can not play rock
with Jesus, even to laugh.

204
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:24,204
You can not play rock with
Jesus is a bastard!

205
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:26,000
Come on, Jesus!

206
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:11,076
Sinners, sinners!

207
00:24:11,327 --> 00:24:14,717
Repent now!

208
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:20,238
And now, sinners,
close your eyes guilty

209
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:22,005
and look up to heaven.

210
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:24,283
Lord, take me now!

211
00:24:56,527 --> 00:24:57,721
Warning!

212
00:25:46,607 --> 00:25:47,642
Who is this old?

213
00:25:48,127 --> 00:25:50,243
- What is he doing?
- He has a gun!

214
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:51,556
Warning!

215
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:05,726
This is blasphemy!

216
00:26:06,807 --> 00:26:07,478
Dad!

217
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:10,842
It is the devil!

218
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:22,436
I beg you ...

219
00:26:23,087 --> 00:26:25,647
I must make my report
Dr. Frubar.

220
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:30,680
What happened,
Mr. Jensen?

221
00:26:30,847 --> 00:26:32,758
No, I must see Dr. Frubar.

222
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,639
What happened?

223
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:38,362
How did you survive?

224
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:43,842
I drifted further and further
in space ...

225
00:35:10,687 --> 00:35:13,121
- This is nonsense!
- I do not believe it!

226
00:35:13,287 --> 00:35:14,515
Inventions!

227
00:35:15,007 --> 00:35:16,759
Please
Give me water.

228
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,406
Josie, Let's get him. He is delirious.

229
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:28,764
Wait.
Those were wonderful years.

230
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:30,846
It worked.

231
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:34,806
We had fun.

232
00:35:36,527 --> 00:35:38,085
We loved each other.

233
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:41,763
It multiplied.

234
00:35:43,327 --> 00:35:45,557
We had never been happier.

235
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:50,596
And then ...

236
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:52,884
They came back.

237
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:20,196
And here I am.

238
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:52,566
Hello America.

239
00:37:52,727 --> 00:37:55,036
Here is my friend Allen the Alien.

240
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:56,676
Next week

241
00:37:56,847 --> 00:37:59,600
we meet the President
and Dr. Frubar.

242
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:03,483
I look forward to the present
Dr. Frubar.

243
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,125
Ladies and gentlemen,

244
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:09,680
President of the United States!

245
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:13,045
Thank you.

246
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:17,126
I will begin
some preliminary remarks.

247
00:38:22,127 --> 00:38:25,483
You know, although I grew up
in poverty,

248
00:38:26,247 --> 00:38:28,124
we ignored
we were poor.

249
00:38:28,327 --> 00:38:31,603
My dear and holy mother
be sacrificed,

250
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,644
she had three jobs,

251
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:37,442
but we are preparing meals
full of love and tenderness,

252
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:40,681
never reprimand
or a slap.

253
00:38:42,847 --> 00:38:44,121
My God!

254
00:38:44,287 --> 00:38:45,686
Bag of shit!

255
00:38:48,447 --> 00:38:50,039
I am pleased to welcome

256
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:52,763
the adventurer, explorer,

257
00:38:53,807 --> 00:38:55,286
the astronaut

258
00:38:55,487 --> 00:38:58,160
this great American

259
00:38:58,647 --> 00:39:00,558
Earl Jensen.

260
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:26,004
It is a pleasure to be here,
before the whole of America.

261
00:39:27,847 --> 00:39:31,123
But I was told
that would be great Dr. Frubar

262
00:39:31,687 --> 00:39:33,439
to introduce myself.

263
00:39:34,007 --> 00:39:35,998
I know you're there, Dr. F.

264
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:40,885
Come share my glory.

265
00:39:42,487 --> 00:39:44,443
If you do not show,

266
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:46,723
I'll get angry.

267
00:39:47,007 --> 00:39:50,204
Calm yourself, Earl.
Everything will be alright.

268
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:54,795
Come quickly, Dr. F.

269
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:58,439
The life of your President
is in danger.

270
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:03,356
- Hurry, or else ...
- It can not, it's the President!

271
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,920
Mr. President, stand firm!

272
00:40:05,127 --> 00:40:08,085
It's a trap.
Boris, come back!

273
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:11,362
The President was eaten
by a nose!

274
00:40:12,447 --> 00:40:14,005
Check the rules!

275
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:17,525
Come quickly,
or the President is screwed.

276
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:21,759
Come, Dr. F.

277
00:40:21,927 --> 00:40:24,282
- What's going on?
- Release the President!

278
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:27,839
Help!

279
00:40:37,527 --> 00:40:39,995
What the hell, God?

280
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:50,282
Boris, idiot!

281
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:52,519
Take off immediately!

282
00:41:13,647 --> 00:41:16,320
I do not know what you cook ...

283
00:41:16,487 --> 00:41:19,479
but it will not work.

284
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:22,682
He
who has emptied your tank!

285
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,515
And you, you little bitch
Where is my finger?

286
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:58,319
America, this is the real Dr. Frubar.
He dropped into space ...

287
00:41:58,487 --> 00:42:02,241
Well done
for our brave heroes

288
00:42:02,407 --> 00:42:04,477
Earl Jensen.

289
00:42:04,807 --> 00:42:09,323
America needs both
to this great man.

290
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:13,846
On the other hand,
I am proud to announce

291
00:42:14,047 --> 00:42:15,844
launch

292
00:42:16,487 --> 00:42:20,162
my most formidable achievement ...

293
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:23,725
the SatPub!

294
00:44:10,407 --> 00:44:11,157
Hurry!

295
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:13,676
Take off! Position helicopter!

296
00:44:29,287 --> 00:44:30,800
You're fired!

297
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:35,719
If we want
job well done ...

298
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,196
Idiots!
You pull my limo!

299
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,242
Dad!

300
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:01,566
Drop them!

301
00:45:34,007 --> 00:45:36,919
Dr. Frubar!

302
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:39,395
Damn.

303
00:46:18,847 --> 00:46:20,166
They escape!

304
00:46:21,127 --> 00:46:22,765
Dad, who are these monsters?

305
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:28,166
Come, Josie, we must start from here.

306
00:46:30,647 --> 00:46:34,003
Dad, what's going on?
Who are these creatures?

307
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:36,956
They saved my life
in space.

308
00:46:37,607 --> 00:46:39,677
Now we must help them.

309
00:46:59,407 --> 00:47:00,601
Look!

310
00:47:11,047 --> 00:47:12,241
Warning!

311
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:22,363
Look, it's Darby!

312
00:47:29,807 --> 00:47:30,796
You're crazy!

313
00:47:31,447 --> 00:47:33,836
Trapping the dome
and let out the aliens.

314
00:47:34,207 --> 00:47:36,163
You're crazy!
They are killers!

315
00:47:36,927 --> 00:47:38,076
You love me?

316
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:40,802
You know I love you ...

317
00:47:42,087 --> 00:47:45,477
I wish we had
a deep and normal.

318
00:47:46,207 --> 00:47:47,686
You want depth?

319
00:47:59,207 --> 00:48:02,324
You love me, Josie?
You do not use it just me?

320
00:48:02,847 --> 00:48:05,839
Come, Darby,
do not talk nonsense!

321
00:48:06,527 --> 00:48:07,960
Come, Darby, c'mon!

322
00:48:08,287 --> 00:48:09,356
Save the aliens!

323
00:48:11,887 --> 00:48:14,765
I do not know
if the time is right, but ...

324
00:48:48,687 --> 00:48:50,484
Darby, wake up!

325
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:27,965
Cease fire!
You pull my SatPub!

326
00:49:28,127 --> 00:49:29,879
Climb!

327
00:49:32,207 --> 00:49:34,437
I can not, I have vertigo!

328
00:49:38,887 --> 00:49:40,161
Climb!

329
00:49:41,007 --> 00:49:42,804
If we get to the clouds,
we are saved.

330
00:49:56,887 --> 00:50:00,118
Dad, what's going on?
Who are these creatures?

331
00:50:00,687 --> 00:50:05,283
Remember, long ago,
when I was drifting in space ...

332
00:50:24,927 --> 00:50:26,758
EARL OF FAREWELL SPEECH

333
00:51:04,767 --> 00:51:06,405
Find him and kill him!

334
00:51:18,087 --> 00:51:20,476
Kill! Kill!

335
00:51:23,727 --> 00:51:27,879
I had to put confidence in Frubar
in order to get revenge,

336
00:51:28,607 --> 00:51:31,758
so I invented
Planet of the story of Nez.

337
00:51:33,287 --> 00:51:34,720
Dad, you're hurt!

338
00:51:36,007 --> 00:51:37,679
II you need a doctor!

339
00:51:42,127 --> 00:51:44,402
Promise me you'll take care of the aliens.

340
00:51:46,327 --> 00:51:47,726
No, Daddy!

341
00:51:48,767 --> 00:51:50,086
I love you!

342
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:25,318
Earl, why did you do that?

343
00:52:25,487 --> 00:52:27,603
You could become a rich hero.

344
00:52:28,087 --> 00:52:29,281
And you ...

345
00:52:30,327 --> 00:52:32,045
Dr. Frubar ...

346
00:52:32,327 --> 00:52:34,079
could have become a human being,

347
00:52:34,887 --> 00:52:38,004
by moving people
before profit.

348
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,715
Remove this wreck!

349
00:53:01,727 --> 00:53:02,796
Today ...

350
00:53:03,287 --> 00:53:05,482
America weeps.

351
00:53:05,967 --> 00:53:08,197
This great American

352
00:53:08,367 --> 00:53:09,925
Earl Jensen

353
00:53:10,647 --> 00:53:13,878
gave his life for his country.

354
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:17,806
He wanted to protect us

355
00:53:18,287 --> 00:53:21,040
these extraterrestrial murderers.

356
00:53:21,807 --> 00:53:26,119
This morning, we found
his body shredded

357
00:53:26,807 --> 00:53:29,037
in their lair.

358
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:32,362
He is now en route

359
00:53:32,527 --> 00:53:35,917
to the large infinity ...

360
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,406
space.

361
00:53:38,447 --> 00:53:40,881
We decided to dedicate

362
00:53:41,127 --> 00:53:44,164
the launching of large SatPub

363
00:53:44,647 --> 00:53:46,763
to his memory.

364
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:51,762
I'm sure it's
what he would have liked.

365
00:53:52,927 --> 00:53:55,566
As for those aliens
evil ...

366
00:53:56,287 --> 00:53:58,084
we will return

367
00:53:58,287 --> 00:54:01,438
to where they came from.

368
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:05,404
See you tomorrow at noon

369
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,444
to participate

370
00:54:07,607 --> 00:54:09,199
in history!

371
00:54:10,287 --> 00:54:13,040
Promise me you'll take care of the aliens.

372
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:26,198
Is closed.
You must go.

373
00:54:37,527 --> 00:54:39,916
Come on, hurry up!

374
00:54:56,367 --> 00:54:58,005
What's happening?

375
00:55:00,087 --> 00:55:01,839
What happens, God?

376
00:55:03,087 --> 00:55:04,486
I give him a bandage.

377
00:55:05,247 --> 00:55:06,805
Help me.
There is little time.

378
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:13,521
I do not know ...

379
00:55:13,687 --> 00:55:15,120
Come, Darby!

380
00:55:39,287 --> 00:55:40,322
Stand there!

381
00:55:47,087 --> 00:55:48,998
Your last meal on Earth.

382
00:55:51,487 --> 00:55:52,681
Thank you. Authorized access.

383
00:56:21,887 --> 00:56:24,720
Thank you. Authorized access.

384
00:56:25,367 --> 00:56:27,437
Good day.

385
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:33,121
Come, Darby! Shoot!

386
00:56:34,367 --> 00:56:36,722
I will not go over

387
00:56:36,887 --> 00:56:39,879
As you would not have said
whole story.

388
00:56:41,207 --> 00:56:44,404
Dad told me everything
Just before he died ...

389
01:00:35,207 --> 01:00:37,243
Hello, handsome.
You're cute.

390
01:00:38,367 --> 01:00:41,439
What's this?
A surprise?

391
01:00:41,927 --> 01:00:43,679
A big surprise!

392
01:00:44,447 --> 01:00:46,085
Come to mommy.

393
01:00:50,607 --> 01:00:52,677
Demon!

394
01:00:52,887 --> 01:00:54,639
My beast ...
What ecstasy!

395
01:01:03,047 --> 01:01:06,244
Dr. Frubar,
advertisers are there.

396
01:01:06,447 --> 01:01:09,519
Come in, gentlemen.
Dr. F. Awaits you.

397
01:01:30,447 --> 01:01:32,961
Darby, quick!
The sun will rise.

398
01:01:33,127 --> 01:01:35,357
Then finished the history of aliens.

399
01:03:18,647 --> 01:03:21,400
Trained to fight,
eager for battle ...

400
01:03:21,847 --> 01:03:23,644
The bait was in place.
And then ...

401
01:03:25,407 --> 01:03:28,080
I've seen it happen to Earth
sparkling.

402
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,043
You are not in advertising!

403
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:46,120
Hello gentlemen,

404
01:03:46,287 --> 01:03:48,084
I hope you have the money.

405
01:03:48,687 --> 01:03:50,166
It's amazing.

406
01:03:50,367 --> 01:03:51,800
According to the report,

407
01:03:51,967 --> 01:03:55,164
these extra-terrestrials
does not come from space, but ...

408
01:03:57,847 --> 01:03:59,485
by ... Earth.

409
01:04:57,847 --> 01:04:59,883
They're off!
They escaped!

410
01:06:25,287 --> 01:06:26,606
Wait ...

411
01:06:27,247 --> 01:06:28,521
LOCK

412
01:06:41,447 --> 01:06:43,961
Ladies and gentlemen,

413
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:48,362
is a great day

414
01:06:48,527 --> 01:06:52,839
for the progress of humanity!

415
01:06:54,367 --> 01:06:56,642
We are here
for the inauguration ...

416
01:06:57,167 --> 01:06:58,759
A little to the left.

417
01:07:03,887 --> 01:07:06,242
That's it. She is in position.

418
01:07:06,407 --> 01:07:08,841
Remove the lens cover.

419
01:07:14,927 --> 01:07:16,246
Now, right!

420
01:08:07,247 --> 01:08:09,363
This is Boris, I'll catch it.

421
01:08:52,567 --> 01:08:55,843
Ye have ever
band nerds!

422
01:08:56,127 --> 01:08:59,642
I am safe
in my SatPub.

423
01:09:05,927 --> 01:09:10,523
These people fool you
disarticulating member after member

424
01:09:11,487 --> 01:09:15,400
while you are only
Children of laboratory animals.

425
01:09:27,287 --> 01:09:29,323
They do not realize

426
01:09:29,527 --> 01:09:33,725
you're just a bunch
unnecessary guinea poor.

427
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:36,203
Dr. F. Said: "Firing."

428
01:09:39,367 --> 01:09:43,440
No, idiots,
not "Firing"!

429
01:09:47,887 --> 01:09:49,445
Dr. F., do not forsake me!

430
01:10:07,647 --> 01:10:09,000
Tickle it!

431
01:10:13,047 --> 01:10:15,436
Again, again, voila!

432
01:10:48,807 --> 01:10:52,004
Goodbye, Josie.

433
01:10:56,647 --> 01:10:59,207
We are alive!

434
01:11:13,767 --> 01:11:15,120
- Boom!
- Fit.

435
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:51,556
The time is surely a misnomer,

436
01:11:52,167 --> 01:11:55,079
but as we
short time to live ...

437
01:11:55,407 --> 01:11:56,920
I wanted to give you this.

438
01:11:57,447 --> 01:11:59,358
It is a minitélescope.

439
01:11:59,767 --> 01:12:01,200
You can see ...

440
01:12:03,847 --> 01:12:04,962
Take the wheel!

441
01:12:05,727 --> 01:12:07,046
I have a crazy idea!

442
01:12:25,287 --> 01:12:26,766
I! Relayed to me.

443
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:28,525
I jump up truck.

444
01:13:15,247 --> 01:13:18,398
The Tensor is what you need.

445
01:13:22,407 --> 01:13:26,195
The Tensor wonders
for the abdominals and buttocks.

446
01:13:29,967 --> 01:13:32,003
... Of humanity.

447
01:13:35,007 --> 01:13:38,443
Ye have ever
band nerds!

448
01:13:38,767 --> 01:13:43,363

They do not realize

452
01:13:55,847 --> 01:13:59,522
you're just a bunch
unnecessary guinea poor.

453
01:14:03,527 --> 01:14:07,156
No, idiots,

454
01:14:13,087 --> 01:14:14,202
Kill!

455
01:14:40,087 --> 01:14:42,317
Give me the ring now.

456
01:15:05,607 --> 01:15:07,199
Wait for me!
