Cora,

is that exactly?

their life on hold here, Marley.

104
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,995

we agreed...

105

no more of this
in front of Emma.

106
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,435

Emma's hospital bills.

If we want to
be together,

113
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,979
Aunt Cora's
the only option.

114
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,481
There's nowhere else to go.

115
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,650
We need to get going,

116
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,619
or we're going to
miss the ferry.

117
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,693
The ferry's
not much further.

118
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,009
There's supposed to
be a ferry.

119
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,611
The schedule said 3:00.

120
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,546
I guess we'll just
have to go back.

121
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,481
[gasping in fright]

122
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,583
Sorry, I...

123
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,452
I didn't mean to
sneak up on you like that.

124
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,288
The schedule said
that there was a 3:00?

125
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,259
Well, uh, lot's of folks
been comin' off the island,

126
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,094
so I didn't expect anybody'd be
wantin' to go.

127
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,095
We don't.

128
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,697
We do.

129
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:24,336
Well, um, there's a big storm
expected tonight,

130
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,239
and if we was to take you over
to the island now, by ferry,

131
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,074
there might not be another ferry
until the storm breaks.

132
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:33,478
and that could be
a couple of days.

133
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,481
The island's not somewhere
you want to be stuck,

134
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,316
not during a storm,

135
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,519
especially not
this time of year.

136
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,254
You heard the man,

137
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,321
this is an all around

138
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,357
bad idea.

139
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,659
The ferry is scheduled
to be running,

140
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,561
and we'd like to
be on it.

141
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,099
Have it your way.

142
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,166
Oh.

143
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:03,241
Looks like you'll have
some company after all.

146
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,161
You folks are gonna
be wanting

147
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,330
to get up to the ramp now,

148
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:26,598
if you want to go.

149
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,400
Just pay when you're on.

150
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,501
There was a young girl
in our back seat.

151
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,136
Did you see where she went?

152
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,872
I thought it was just
the two of you.

153
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,309
Emma?

154
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,377
Emma!

155
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,616
I can't hold
the ferry,

156
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,319
not with
the storm comin'.

157
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,621
Emma, we need to go!

158
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:53,658
Emma?

159
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,466
Emma!

160
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,537
Emma!

161
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,541
- Emma!
- Emma!

162
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,611
- Emma!
- Emma, come on, let's go!

163
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,713
Emma, we have
to go now.

164
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,615
Emma!

165
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,583
Emma, where are you?

166
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,490
Emma, where are you?

167
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,593
Emma!

168
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:30,829
Emma, we have to
get on the ferry,

169
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,498
or we're going to be
stuck here tonight!

170
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,468
Emma?

171
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,670
We don't want to be stuck here.

172
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,873
Emma!

[screams]

177
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,465
It's all right.
It's okay.

178
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,600
It's all right.
It's okay.

179
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,534
I just, uh...

180
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,535
I wanted to let you know

181
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,604
I saw that girl
you were looking for.

182
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,539
She was walking
towards the ferry.

183
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,474
I just thought
you'd want to know.

184
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,512
Hey, I'd, uh,
stay off that island

185
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,513
till the storm passes

186
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,847
if I were you.

187
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,550
I think we'll manage.

188
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,687
Oh, I don't know
about that.

189
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,456
Last time a storm hit
that island on Halloween, uh,

190
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,491
half the people there
ended up dead.

191
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,497
I'd just steer clear,
that's all I'm saying.

192
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,834
If you're so worried,
then why are you going?

193
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,871
I have my reasons.

194
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,375
I guess that makes two of us.

195
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,582
[muttering] Well, don't say
I didn't warn you.

197
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,541
[crying softly]

198
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,677
Sarah, I found her!

199
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,712
I found Emma!

200
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,613
Em, what are you doing?

201
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,515
You scared the hell out of us.

202
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,786
What is it, Em?

203
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,854
Are you all right?

204
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,059
It's Aunt Cora,

205
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,694
something's happened to her.

206
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,662
Aunt Cora's fine,

207
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,498
we just talked to her
this morning.

208
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,901
But I saw it,

209
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,704
in my dream.

210
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,748
Emma, what's going on?

211
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,517
I'm sorry, I just...

212
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,086
I wanted to see
the island.

213
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,455
[thunder rolling]

214
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,025
It's okay,

215
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,528
no harm done.

216
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,496
We gotta get going, though.

217
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,468
Her dreams aren't
getting any better.

218
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,005
She needs time.

219
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,506
Things will get better.

220
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:32,510
She watched our parents
burn to death in their own car,

221
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,546
she barely survived it herself.

222
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,749
You really think she's ever
going to get over that?

223
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,160

Where the hell is everyone?

228
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,709
Aunt Cora's
still not answering.

229
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,113
Em's been sleeping
an awful lot.

230
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,648
It's her meds.

231
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,749
It makes her tired.

232
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,151
Well that's really going to
help with the nightmares.

233
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,725
You do know where
you're going, right?

234
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,694
Don't start, okay?

235
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,966
Someone's watching us.

236
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,805
Pick a direction
and let's just go.

237
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,407
[cell phone signal searching]

238
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:52,977
What does the GPS say?

239
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,545
Nothing, there's
no reception out here.

240
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,347
I thought you said you knew
where you were going?

241
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,117
I got turned around, okay?

242
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,953
I thought I saw
that green car again.

243
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:02,787
Guys...

244
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,122
Nothing is ever
your fault, is it?

245
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,156
Guys!

246
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,659
We're almost out of gas.

247
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,065
How long has it
been like that?

00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,334
[distant squealing roar]

249
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,570
What is that?

250
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,339
I don't know, Em.

251
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,775
Drive, just drive.

No. [groans]

256
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,870
This isn't happening.

257
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,705
Tell me this
isn't happening.

258
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,941
We just have to walk, okay?

259
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,810
Aunt Cora's is
just down the road.

[hissing roar]

261
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:10,822
Leave it.
Let's just go.

262
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,124
We need Emma's medication.

263
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:13,991
Let's just go,
come on.

Let's go.

Who's wishing
we stayed in the city now?

268

Are you okay?
We're almost there.

274
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:44,222
There.
Is that Aunt Cora's house?

Oh, my God.

277

Get Emma in the house.

278
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,533
What?

279
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,168

in the house.

going to do?

It isn't safe up here.

I don't know, Em!

I don't know.

Give me a hand.

Don't just
stand there, Marley,

310
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,537
help me get her
in the house.

311
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:14,672
Where's Emma?

312
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,840
She's already
in the basement.

313
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,480
What the hell
is going on, Sarah?

314
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:23,681
What happened to her?

315
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:24,715
Listen to me--

316
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,584
What happened
to Aunt Cora?

00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,085
Listen to me,

someone out there

that killed Aunt Cora,

320

and they're after
this woman.

00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,658
Do you understand
what that means?

[distant shrieking]

323
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,296

in the basement!

00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,970
How's she doing?

00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:20,971
Not good.

in medical school

She needs a doctor.

You...

334
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,665
you must hide.

335
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,701
Death has come.

336
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,104
The killing won't stop

337
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,139
until the end of Halloween.

338
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,042
Everything's
going to be okay.

339
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,611
No, it's not.

340
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,680
I didn't believe...

341
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,250
you have to.

342
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,224
What did she just say?

343
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,226
What the hell
is she talking about?

344
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:17,261
I don't know.

345
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,731
She's in a lot of pain.

346
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,367
It's time you tell me
what happened to Aunt Cora.

347
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,071
I'm not sure, okay?

348
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,839
Stop treating me like a child!

349
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:29,974
Tell me what happened!

350
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,209
I don't know what happened
to her, all right!

351
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,778
I deserve to know, Sarah.

352
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,180
Fine, you wanna know?

353
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,152
Her eyes were gone,

354
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,353
just gone,

355
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,021
like someone cut them
out of her head or something.

356
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,727
And then some sick twist
set her insides on fire.

357
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,131
What?

358
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,203
What?

359
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,141
I'm sorry.

360
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,244
I shouldn't have told you,
not like that.

[rummaging]

362
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,392
This afternoon, in the truck,

363
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,128
Emma said she had a dream
about Aunt Cora,

364
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,196
that something happened to her.

365
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,797
How did she know that, Sarah?

366
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,232
How?

367
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,233
It's...

368
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,201
It's coincidence.

369
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,903
I mean, it has to be.

370
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,038
She's been having
those types of dreams

371
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,239
about all of us.

372
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:39,343
She thinks death follows
her around wherever she goes.

373
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,878
She's terrified

374
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,947
that everyone around her
is gonna die.

375
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:53,791
Well, I'm not gonna
let that happen.

376
00:24:58,396 --> 00:24:59,230
<i>Emma!</i>

377
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,300
<i>[screams echo]</i>

378
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,488
[inhales deeply]

379
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,862
Emma's still out.

380
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,197
Let her sleep.

381
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,198
She had a rough night,

382
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,000
and I don't want her
to see Aunt Cora.

383
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,806
That woman
doesn't look too good.

384
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,009
If we don't get her
to a hospital,

385
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,844
she's not going to last
much longer.

386
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,482
I found a hose.

387
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,023
Okay, so we'll siphon the gas
from Aunt Cora's car--

388
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,458
that can't be
too hard--

389
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,161
we'll get ours going,
and...

390
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:06,330
we'll get her
to the hospital.

391
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,270
She said the killing won't stop
until the end of Halloween.

392
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:17,174
What if whoever chased her here
and killed Aunt Cora

393
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,443
is just out there

394
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,545
waiting for us?

395
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,351
If we stay here,
she'll die for sure.

396
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,023
Give me the hose.

397
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,341
[flies buzzing]

398
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,195
Just don't look, okay?

399
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,364
Let's just get this
over with.

400
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,444
I should have
listened to him.

401
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,147
Listened to who?

402
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,951
That creepy guy
back at the ferry?

403
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,187
He said the last time a storm
hit here on Halloween,

404
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:40,424
nearly everyone died.

405
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,028
He said what?

406
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,163
And you're just
telling me this now?

407
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,465
I thought he was just
some weirdo, okay?

408
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,334
For all you know,
he's the one doing all of this!

409
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,268
I didn't
want to worry you

410
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,671
any more than you
already were,

411
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,673
I am so sick and tired
of you thinking

412
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,241
you know what's best for me!

413
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:58,275
That's enough,
Marley--

414
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,410
It's not enough
that our parents are dead?

415
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:00,411
Now you're going to get
the rest of us killed--

416
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,445
I said that's enough!

417
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
[screams]

418
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,453
Marley...

419
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,691
Don't touch me.

420
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,126
Don't, okay, just don't.

421
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:22,299
Why would someone do that
to another person?

422
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,142
It's gone.

423
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,343
What's gone?

424
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,145
The car is gone.

425
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,652
Okay...

426
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,188
Okay, so... so we'll walk.

427
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,355
We need to get that woman
to the hospital.

428
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,356
We'll send someone, all right?

429
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,357
We just need to get
the hell out of here

430
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,358
while we still can!

431
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,393
What about Emma?

432
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,495
She won't make far
with her leg like that.

433
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:52,563
Well, what do you
suggest we do,

434
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,264
just wait here
until that psycho shows up?

435
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,740
No...

436
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:05,309
no way in hell.

437
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:06,343
We don't have a choice, Marley.

438
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,344
You know we don't.

439
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,314
You keep watch...

440
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,218
I'll deal with it.

441
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,324
[flies buzzing]

442
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,114
Marley, I'm...

443
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,183
I'm going to need
your help after all.

444
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,836
[engine starter chugging]

445
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,738
[Emma]: Marley!

446
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,541
Em, stay where you are!

447
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,726
Is everything all right?

448
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,394
I woke up,
and you guys weren't there.

449
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:08,498
Em, you shouldn't be out here.
You need to go back inside.

450
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,533
But everyone was gone.

451
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,934
I didn't know where you were--

452
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:12,936
Emma!

453
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,408
[Marley]:
Emma, get away from there!

454
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:21,745
[screaming]

455
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:25,916
Emma!

456
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,252
Emma, kick!

457
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,486
Kick!

458
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,288
Get it!

459
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,695
Emma, kick!

460
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,763
[groaning with effort]

461
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,391
Emma! Marley!

462
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,348
[shrieking]

463
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,125
[sobbing]

464
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,026
This isn't happening.

465
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,094
Tell me this
isn't happening!

466
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:48,031
[screams and sobs]

467
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,299
Em, not much
longer, okay?

468
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,368
Everything's going
to be all right.

469
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:52,369
We're getting
out of here.

470
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:53,704
And where the hell
are we going to go, huh?

471
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,072
Or have you forgotten

472
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:55,973
that there's no way
off this island

473
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,507
until tomorrow?

474
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,979
We'll--we'll
find help in town.

475
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,880
Are you serious?

476
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,315
Did you see that thing?

477
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,517
Who the hell's going to
be able to help us?

478
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,586
I don't know, all right?

479
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,588
But you're not
helping the situation.

480
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:13,857
Do you understand?

481
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,261
Sarah's right, Em.

482
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,496
We're going to get through this,

483
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,599
and then we'll find
a way out of here.

484
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,406
I should...

485
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,041
I should have
told you.

486
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,043
Told me what?

487
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,945
I saw it.

488
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,513
We all did.

489
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,681
Just try not to
think about it.

490
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,016
No, no.

491
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,083
I saw it
in my dream.

492
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,387
I should have
warned you.

493
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,989
That woman's dead
because of me.

494
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,158
None of this
is your fault, Em.

495
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:55,165
Whatever's happening here
has nothing to do with you.

496
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,400
[screams] Sarah!

497
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,108
What was that?

498
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,544
Everyone
stay in the car.

499
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,928
Hitting him
didn't do that.

500
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,196
We need to get
the hell out of here now

501
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,898
before we end up like him.

502
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,900
We need to find help.

503
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,401
These people aren't
going to help us.

504
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:32,736
You saw how they just
stared at us before.

505
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,904
They were scared,

506
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:34,871
they knew
this was going to happen.

507
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,340
There's nowhere else to go,

508
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,675
you said so yourself.

509
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:41,445
We can go to the ferry dock.

510
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,180
Maybe there's
another boat there,

511
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,882
they should at least
have a radio, right?

512
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,517
Please, Sarah, just this once,

513
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:48,985
I need you to listen to me.

514
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,221
We need to go now.

515
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,824
Okay,

516
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,559
let's get in the car.

517
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,464
Emma?

518
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:01,898
Emma?

519
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,933
Emma!

520
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,168
She just
wandered off, right?

521
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,236
Like she did before?

522
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,039
Emma!

523
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:12,542
If something happened,
we would have heard.

524
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:13,577
Oh, my God.

525
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,017
She thinks
everyone around her dies.

526
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,820
She's trying to protect us.

527
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:24,821
No.

528
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,523
No, no, no... No!

529
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,792
Emma!

530
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,495
Emma!

531
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,929
Emma?

532
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,098
Emma!

533
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,700
Emma?

534
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,508
Emma!

535
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,246
Emma!

536
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,551
Emma?

537
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:56,720
Emma!

538
00:35:59,056 --> 00:35:59,990
Emma!

539
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,560
Emma?

540
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:07,898
[screams]

541
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,372
Emma?

542
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,218
[rattling]

543
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,627
Emma?

544
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,011
Emma?

545
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,014
Emma, none of this
is your fault.

546
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,918
Not another sound.

547
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,392
Emma?

548
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,473
They're dead.

549
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:25,542
They're all dead.

550
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,219
[door creaking]

551
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:51,901
Emma?

552
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,009
Emma, is that you?

553
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,344
You need to come out, okay?

554
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,814
None of this is your fault.

555
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,890
Em, you in here?

556
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,996
- [screaming]
- You need to get out of here.

557
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,698
Get out!

558
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,566
[screaming]

559
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:28,038
[screaming]

560
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:37,847
Sarah!

561
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,950
Sarah!

562
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:46,723
[sizzling]

563
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,495
[screams]

564
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:56,833
[screaming]

565
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:01,971
No!

566
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:09,913
[screaming]

567
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,650
[shots blasting]

568
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,420
Come on, let's go, let's go!

569
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,697
[growling]

570
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:33,870
[growling]

571
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:42,278
[muffled protests]

572
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,315
[muffled groans]

573
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,818
[shop bell jingles]

574
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,388
[Marley]: I can't be here,
I need to find my sisters.

575
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,023
[Man]: Sorry, I cannot
let you do that.

576
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,358
What you need to do
is shut the hell up, okay?

577
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,394
That thing out there
was almost gone

578
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,294
until you and
your friends showed up.

579
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,698
You almost got us
all killed.

580
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,732
Let her go, Toby.

581
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,734
I think she gets
the message.

582
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,070
Yeah?
She better have.

583
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,775
Now, maybe you'll be able
to keep her quiet, too.

584
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,746
[muffled cries]

585
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:17,847
Sarah?

586
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,484
What did they do to you?

587
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,319
She didn't
leave us any choice.

588
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:28,124
She wouldn't stop yelling.
It was going to hear us in here.

589
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,961
Where's Emma?
Did you find her?

590
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:37,867
Please, our sister
is out still there.

591
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:38,868
I'm sorry,

592
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:39,869
but if your sister's
out there right now,

593
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,404
she's already dead.

594
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,872
But you're all alive,

595
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:44,040
you've managed to survive.

596
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,310
We survived by accident.

597
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,248
When everyone else
ran away,

598
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,117
we all hid in the freezer.

599
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,251
We could hear them,

600
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,021
but we knew
if we opened the door,

601
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,790
we'd be dead
right along with them.

602
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:05,428
What the hell
is that thing out there?

603
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,931
Why don't you ask
Mr. Internet Sensation

604
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:08,865
over here.

605
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,400
He seems to have
all the answers.

606
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:11,968
You knew about this
at the ferry,

607
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,369
and you didn't
say anything?

608
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,472
Look, I tried to warn you,
all right, I did.

609
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,073
When I saw you on Main Street,

610
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,141
I was gonna tell
you guys everything,

611
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,209
but you drove off
too fast.

612
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,143
You said that
some people died

613
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:21,478
in the last storm that was here.

614
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,812
You never said anything

615
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,380
about that thing
out there!

616
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,482
Look, I was just trying
to mess with you, all right?

617
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,317
I didn't think it was real.

618
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:28,351
Yeah?

619
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:32,188
Thought it was real enough
to bring a gun.

620
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:38,361
Okay, look, I have
a web series, all right?

621
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:39,896
I stay overnight
at haunted places.

622
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,231
None of them ever really
turn out to be haunted,

623
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,365
right?

624
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,466
I bring the gun

625
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,434
because you never know
who you're going to run into

626
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:45,368
on these things.

627
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,203
It's just me.

628
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,839
There's a lot of
crazies out there.

629
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,007
I just bring it

630
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,075
for protection.

631
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,109
It's...

632
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,082
A couple of weeks ago, I...

633
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:02,085
I was in a bar,

634
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,086
I met this old guy,

635
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,087
he was drunk,

636
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,388
started in
with this story

637
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,524
about an island
that he used to live on.

638
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:11,027
Said that on Halloween, 1915,
a storm hit,

639
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,428
killed half the people here.

640
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,064
Get to the part

641
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,933
where you tell us what's killing
everyone out there.

642
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,271
Officially?

643
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:24,574
The locals say
it was the storm.

644
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:28,545
The old man says that the storm
brought something with it,

645
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,380
something evil.

646
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,981
Yeah.

647
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,383
Tell her why.

648
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:36,352
On the eve of Halloween,
before the storm hit,

649
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,989
the townspeople,

650
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,091
they burned six girls
at the stake for...

651
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,427
for practicing witchcraft.

652
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:46,195
Now, as the story goes,

653
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,931
before the girls
burned to death,

654
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:49,299
they summoned a storm...

655
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,435
lightning struck
each one of them,

656
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,003
pulling their spirits
up into the storm,

657
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,072
so that they could return
as something far,

658
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,374
far more evil.

659
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,510
They unleashed their revenge
on the island

660
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:02,111
until the sun came up,

661
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,347
ending All Hallows' Eve.

662
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:08,384
And that's not even
the best part.

663
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,121
The witches, they, um,

664
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,057
they vowed to return

665
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,625
on the anniversary
of their murder,

666
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,594
once every hundred years,

667
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:21,164
wipe out everyone
who dares stay on the island.

668
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,467
People around here

669
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,402
have been telling
that story for years,

670
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,504
but nobody ever
believed them.

671
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:32,976
Yeah, well, I'm sure
as hell a believer.

672
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,644
So how do we kill it?

673
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,379
We don't...

674
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,314
we survive it.

675
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:41,217
The killing won't stop
until the end of Halloween.

676
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,019
Tonight's Halloween,

677
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,254
and that's why
we're not leaving until morning,

678
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,257
not until sunrise.

679
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,160
We'll stay here for the night,

680
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:54,397
and that thing will
go back where it came from,

681
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:55,498
just like it did last time.

682
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:58,067
Well, that's not happening.

683
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,235
I told you,
our sister's out there,

684
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:00,069
and we're going to find her.

685
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:00,703
Wait, you can't--

686
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:01,671
What makes you think

687
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,239
you're the only one
who's lost someone?

688
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,440
If you wanna stop us,
you're gonna have to shoot us.

689
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,010
I'm not playing around here!

690
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,044
Hey, just let
her go, Toby!

691
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,048
No one is leaving here
until morning, okay?

692
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:13,449
Until that sun rises,

693
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,151
no one is leaving
this building.

694
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,390
I don't think
it kills everyone.

695
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,260
I don't think
it kills everyone.

696
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:28,398
Not right away at least.

697
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:30,533
You know, I think it's
taking them somewhere.

698
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,202
Why do you
think that?

699
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,407
When we were out
chasing after these two,

700
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:40,410
I saw quite a few
bloody drag marks

701
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:41,344
where there was no bodies.

702
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:44,747
And?

703
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:48,251
And they were all heading
in the same direction.

704
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,321
I've been thinking about it,

705
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,557
and the only thing
that would make sense

706
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,225
is if it's dragging them all
to the same place.

707
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,293
But why?

708
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,231
And who says
they're not already dead?

709
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:04,367
I'm just saying that
there's still a chance.

710
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:08,071
Why take some of the bodies,
but not the others?

711
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:09,539
You know, maybe there are
survivors out there.

712
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,074
Jill's dead, all right?

713
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,275
Then where's her body, huh?

714
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,276
Don't--

715
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,277
Why wasn't it here
with the others?

716
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:16,379
Who's Jill?

717
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,382
Ask him.

718
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,684
You know as well as I do

719
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,386
that if I would have
opened up that freezer door,

720
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,287
we would all be dead.

721
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,523
Okay?
I saved your life.

722
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,358
We never should
have been here

723
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,761
in the first place.

724
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,298
Come with us.

725
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:37,200
You're looking
for someone, too.

726
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,302
We can search
together.

727
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:41,838
You must be good with
tracking and stuff, right?

728
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:47,577
This was our first trip out.

729
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:50,313
We came to the island

730
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,347
because you're not allowed
to hunt here.

731
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:55,351
The deer don't know
to be afraid, you know?

732
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,355
They're easy picking.

733
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,225
I was just trying
to impress my girlfriend.

734
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,462
Well, none of that changes
the fact that no one's leaving.

735
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:10,833
Says who?

736
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,236
Oh, you don't got the guts!

737
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,337
Yeah? Try me!

738
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:15,338
Okay, okay...

739
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:16,405
Okay, this is
getting out of hand.

740
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,608
Toby, if they want to leave,
just let them leave.

741
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,779
Maybe they'll
lead it away, right?

742
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,413
Come on.

743
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:29,218
[woman screaming]

744
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:32,355
[screaming in terror]
Somebody help me, please!

745
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:35,892
Anybody!

746
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:36,826
Do you see anything?

747
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,195
Not yet.

748
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:40,396
Nothing over here.

749
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,532
God, you need
to help me!

750
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,467
You're
kidding me, right?

751
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,736
If I'm dying,
I'm leaving a record.

752
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,404
I'm going to find her

753
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:49,806
and shut her up
before she gets us all killed.

754
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,673
No, wait.

755
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:52,341
Wait.

756
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,710
I see her in the parking lot.

757
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,414
[woman screaming]
Somebody!

758
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:00,383
Please!

759
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,586
I don't want to die!

760
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,521
Why is she just standing there,
out in the open like that?

761
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:06,689
We got to go get her.

762
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:07,690
No, not so fast.

763
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:10,226
Something's not right.

764
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,260
We can't just let her
die out there!

765
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,261
There.

766
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,663
There it is.

767
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:14,597
Do you see it?

768
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:20,436
[screaming]

769
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,704
Help me!

770
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:23,706
Oh, my God.

771
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,274
It's using her
as bait.

772
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,343
So, what do we do?

773
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:28,444
Nothing.

774
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:29,445
We can't just
do nothing--

775
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,813
[clattering]

776
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,415
[screaming]

777
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,326
What the hell
were you thinking?

778
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,560
It slipped, okay?
I'm sorry.

779
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,829
We have to
get out of here.

780
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,898
Maybe we're good,

781
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:51,334
maybe it didn't
hear us.

782
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:53,369
We'll hide it out
in the freezer

783
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,004
just like last time.

784
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,372
We can't get
trapped in here,

785
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:57,340
we have to find Emma.

786
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,975
Look, you can
stand out here

787
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,309
and discuss this
all you want,

788
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:04,413
but as soon as
that freezer door closes...

789
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:05,181
there's no getting in.

790
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,983
It's keeping
people alive, Toby.

791
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,885
You just
saw it yourself.

792
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:12,321
Jill might
still be alive.

793
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,490
Help me find her.
You owe her that.

794
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:16,626
We're no use to anybody
if we're dead.

795
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:21,764
Now, who's coming with me?

796
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,381
Nichole, what the hell
are you doing? Come on.

797
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,016
I don't want
anybody else to die

798
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,083
because I did nothing.

799
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:45,388
Come on, Alex,
don't be stupid.

800
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,423
You're a coward, Toby.

801
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:51,727
I just don't see the upside
in being a dead hero.

802
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:57,400
Nice knowing you.

803
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:22,725
Good luck.

804
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:55,091
Do you hear that?

805
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,260
[silence]

806
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,796
It's gone.

807
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,630
It stopped,

808
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,467
that doesn't mean
that it's gone.

809
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,436
I only have
three rounds left.

810
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:10,306
That's not going to
get us far.

811
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:15,111
The sheriff's station
is a block down.

812
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:16,112
We might stay
out of sight

813
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,147
if we go through
the alley in the back.

814
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,482
What if it's
waiting for us there?

815
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,250
We need those weapons.

816
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:24,086
You head there.

817
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,955
I'll draw it away.

818
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:28,557
I'm going to
need this.

819
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:29,992
Marley, what the hell
are you doing?

820
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,927
Marley!

821
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,283
Go to the left.

822
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,309
Maybe we should
have gone with them.

823
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:21,644
I didn't stop you.

824
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:23,979
What if there are other people
still alive out there, Toby?

825
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:24,980
We could help them--

826
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:25,981
We already
risked our necks

827
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:26,982
once for them,

828
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,451
look at the thanks
that got us.

829
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,687
The only person

830
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,255
I'm interested in
keeping alive now

831
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,191
is myself.

832
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:39,028
Well, I'm going after them,
and they're--

833
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,371
[groaning in pain]

834
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,207
[muffled gunshots]

835
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,642
[screaming and thudding]

836
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:45,661
I guess
we wait and see

837
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,797
what your sister
has in store.

838
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,312
[whispering]
What the hell did she do?

839
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,681
Okay, if we're going to go,
we're going to go now.

840
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,182
Go. I got your back.

841
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,350
Go.

842
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,285
It's just around
the other side of the building.

843
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:37,039
Check that room
over there.

844
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,487
[static crackling]

845
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:55,124
Hello. Can anyone hear me?

846
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:56,325
[static crackling]

847
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:58,460
Hello?

848
00:54:58,495 --> 00:54:59,461
Does anybody copy?

849
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:01,697
Can you hear me?

850
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:09,071
Hello. Is anyone
out there?

851
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,175
Please.
Can anyone hear me?

852
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:15,978
This is
an emergency.

853
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:16,879
Hello.
Does anybody copy?

854
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:17,880
Can you hear me?

855
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:19,915
This is
an emergency.

856
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:23,385
Is anyone out there?

857
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,753
Hello? Does
anybody hear me?

858
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:25,788
This is an emergency.

859
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,356
[screaming]

860
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,397
[whispering]
I'm okay...

861
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:36,865
I'm okay.

862
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,940
Do you think it heard us?

863
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:47,309
I don't know.

864
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,478
Come on, let's go.

865
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:28,951
This is everything.

866
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:29,985
Do you really think

867
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:31,286
all this is going
to stop that thing?

868
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:34,423
Well, it slowed it down
the first time.

869
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:38,293
That's... something,
right?

870
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,498
She'll be back.

871
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,301
We'd best
be going, Sarah.

872
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:50,939
We don't want to be
looking in the dark.

873
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:06,188
So, are you going to show us how
to load these things?

874
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:08,357
Everything is loaded
and good to go.

875
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:09,992
You just got to
release the safety.

876
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,260
It's, uh,
it's right there,

877
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:14,263
by, uh, by your thumb.

878
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:15,464
You wanna just...

879
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:16,899
press it.

880
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,404
You said that
all the drag marks

881
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,239
were headed
in the same direction.

882
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,474
Which way was that?

883
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:28,377
Well,

884
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:31,914
these are the ones

885
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,482
that I saw this morning.

886
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,319
And this...

887
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:40,622
this is the one we saw
on the way here.

888
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,459
They all seem
to be leading

889
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:45,961
to this side of the island.

890
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,329
What's over here?

891
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:50,365
Nothing really,
it's just forest.

892
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:54,236
There is
an old power station

893
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,071
not far from there.

894
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:58,407
It's been closed
for years.

895
00:57:58,441 --> 00:57:59,441
Right...

896
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,443
here.

897
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,478
[gasps]

898
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,952
What the hell?

899
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:12,621
[screaming]

900
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,524
[screaming]

901
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:28,303
God! Please help!

902
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:42,351
[wood splintering]

903
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,021
Shoot it!

904
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:55,497
[shrieking]

905
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,033
I'll get the door.

906
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,440
Alex?

907
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,341
Alex...

908
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,310
[screaming]

909
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:10,112
[screaming in agony]

910
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:11,413
[shrieking]

911
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:12,414
[fires]

912
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:14,650
[gun clicking uselessly]

913
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:27,896
[tires screeching]

914
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:29,531
Get in!

915
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:34,269
Where's Alex
and Nichole?

916
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:35,737
Go! Go, go!

917
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:39,408
Head out of town.

918
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:42,544
I think I know where it is.

919
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,346
Are you going to
tell me what happened?

920
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,414
It killed them,
all right?

921
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:47,649
Like it does everyone else.

922
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:51,753
Where were you
all that time?

923
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:55,757
I thought I heard Emma,
so I went looking.

924
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,394
And?

925
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,898
I found this...

926
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:11,306
But there were drag marks,
like Alex was saying.

927
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:13,909
She's still
alive, okay?

928
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:26,822
I think it's a left up here.

929
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:28,757
To go where?

930
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,692
Alex and Nichole thought
they found the spot

931
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:32,661
it might be taking them.

932
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:34,529
Okay.

933
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,502
You sure about this?

934
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:41,870
There's an
old power plant.

935
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:43,338
It looks like

936
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:44,640
the drag marks
are leading there.

937
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,740
Better than
nothing, right?

938
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:19,708
Yeah.

939
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:20,742
It should be
through here.

940
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,128
We should
keep going.

941
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:46,735
[branches rustling]

942
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,813
There.

943
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:05,787
Sarah...

944
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:21,503
There's a trail
over this way.

945
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:23,572
This must be
where it's dragging them.

946
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:27,743
Come on.

947
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:39,688
[branches rustling]

948
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,959
[branches rustling]

949
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,062
Sarah?

950
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,541
Sarah?

951
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:33,942
Sarah?

952
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:51,526
Sarah, is that you?

953
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,041
Sarah?

954
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,645
Sarah!

955
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,646
[quietly]
Marley!

956
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:12,814
[gasps]

957
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,699
[distant shrieking]

958
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:56,992
This must be
where they burned them,

959
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:59,761
the girls,

960
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:01,763
like Seth was saying.

961
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,739
The trail,
it just ends here.

962
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,578
There's fresh blood here...

963
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,014
[screams]

964
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:20,048
Marley!

965
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:25,287
Oh, my God.

966
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,722
They're
in here, Marley.

967
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:28,556
There in here!

968
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:34,529
[sobbing]

969
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:37,399
[groaning with effort]

970
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:46,441
[coughing and sobbing]

971
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:51,880
Please, please,
please, please...

972
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,215
it's gonna be back.

973
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,718
It feeds on us.

974
01:05:59,855 --> 01:06:01,423
Emma!

975
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:04,693
Emma, say something!

976
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:13,702
[gasping with effort]

977
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,570
No, no...

978
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,009
Emma, say something!

979
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:28,583
No... No, no!

980
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:31,553
Emma!

981
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:33,021
Sh-She...

982
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:34,889
She needs to be quiet.

983
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:36,391
It will hear her.

984
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:39,027
Emma!

985
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:41,529
Marley, help me!

986
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:43,665
She has to be here somewhere!

987
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:02,183
Over here!

988
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:03,184
Over here, I have her!

989
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,053
Emma!

990
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,421
Shh! Shh!

991
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:08,356
Emma!

992
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:09,657
Be quiet...

993
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:10,792
[roaring with effort]

994
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:13,461
Be quiet.

995
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,897
Please, please,
please be quiet...

996
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,638
Emma...

997
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:25,940
[grunting with effort]

998
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:27,142
Shh! Shh...

999
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:29,077
[gasping and panting]

1000
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:33,481
Emma,

1001
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:36,718
we're gonna get you
out of here.

1002
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,220
[screaming]
No! No! Help me!

1003
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:40,288
Help me!

1004
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:41,556
[screaming]
Help me!

1005
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:42,957
Help me!
Help me!

1006
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:44,492
Help!

1007
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:51,266
Get up.
Get up...

1008
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:57,772
[growling]

1009
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:01,309
Get her out of here.

1010
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,410
Keep her safe.

1011
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:03,311
Sarah?

1012
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:04,479
Sarah, no! No!

1013
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:07,082
You're not going to get her,
you son-of-a-bitch!

1014
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:08,116
Sarah!

1015
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:11,453
Sarah!

1016
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:25,633
Emma, go on.

1017
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:27,702
Emma, can you help me?
Come on.

1018
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:30,705
Emma, we've got to
get out of here.

1019
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:44,352
Come on Emma,
just a little further.

1020
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:49,858
Emma? Emma, you're going to
have to help, okay?

1021
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:52,594
Look. Look, that must be
part of the power plant.

1022
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:54,295
Come on.
Almost there.

1023
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,734
Hang in there, Emma.

1024
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:01,903
Emma, stay with me.

1025
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:15,450
[gasping with exhaustion]

1026
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,652
[thunder rumbling]

1027
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,393
[chain rattling]
No. No...

1028
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,768
[Emma]:
<i>I saw this in my dream.</i>

1029
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:35,770
[Marley]: Emma, I know.
Come on.

1030
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:38,239
Emma, don't!

1031
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:40,341
Emma!

1032
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:47,482
[distant growling]

1033
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:15,810
[screams]

1034
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:18,179
[gasping in relief]

1035
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,416
It's okay...
It's okay.

1036
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,351
We need to get out of here.

1037
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:26,020
I thought...

1038
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,422
I thought you were...

1039
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:29,724
Yeah, me too.

1040
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:32,694
Emma...

1041
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,262
Emma?

1042
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:36,231
[screaming]

1043
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:38,466
It's okay,
it's okay, it's me.

1044
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:41,569
[thunder crackling]

1045
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:49,644
[distant shrieking]

1046
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:53,915
We don't have
time for that.

1047
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:54,983
I've almost got it.

1048
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:56,150
I've almost...

1049
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,587
I've got it!

1050
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:06,794
[shrieking approaching]

1051
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,265
Come on.

1052
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:43,798
I'm scared.

1053
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:44,966
I know.

1054
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,801
We all are.

1055
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:48,903
We just need to wait it out
in here until morning,

1056
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:49,737
and this will all be over.

1057
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:54,475
We should find somewhere
to stay out of sight.

1058
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:07,922
We stick together, right?

1059
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:09,357
No more running off.

1060
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:11,592
[screams]

1061
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:13,928
Get it off me!

1062
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:15,730
Get it off!

1063
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,732
[screaming]
Get it off me!

1064
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:19,834
Emma, Emma, go.

1065
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:21,836
No! I'm not leaving you!

1066
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:24,205
Pull!

1067
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,374
Emma, I said, go!

1068
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:27,875
[shrieking]

1069
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:35,783
Go, go, go!

1070
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:38,720
There must be somewhere to hide,
somewhere it can't find us.

1071
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:41,756
There's no way out.
It won't be able to get to us.

1072
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,424
There's no time!

1073
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:44,759
[screaming]

1074
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:49,731
Keep going!

1075
01:12:58,841 --> 01:12:59,907
Keep going.

1076
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:06,280
[shrieking]

1077
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:34,742
There.
We can hide in there.

1078
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:51,292
We're going to
get out of here, okay?

1079
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:54,862
No. No, we aren't.

1080
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:57,565
I saw it, in my dream.

1081
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:03,738
Everyone around me dies.

1082
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:04,906
We're not dying, Emma.

1083
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,574
I'm not leaving you,
you hear me?

1084
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,342
[low growling]

1085
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:11,012
[shrieking]

1086
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,684
[gasping in terror]

1087
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:20,688
[shrieking overhead]

1088
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:22,757
I love you guys.

1089
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,393
What?

1090
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:26,394
What?

1091
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:27,995
Hey, you son-of-a-bitch!

1092
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:28,996
Sarah--

1093
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:30,031
Shh!

1094
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:34,702
[muffled sobbing]

1095
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:38,072
I'm over here!

1096
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:42,376
Sarah!

1097
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,514
[sobbing and screaming]

1098
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:47,815
Hey!

1099
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:53,788
Hey!

1100
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:57,825
Come and get me!

1101
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:11,906
[muffled screams]

1102
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,674
Shh! Emma, shh.

1103
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:25,887
Come on!

1104
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:27,088
I'm down here!

1105
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,701
[shrieking]

1106
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:43,437
Hey!

1107
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:44,839
I'm over here!

1108
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:47,408
Come and get me,
you son of a bitch!

1109

[shrieking]

1110
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:53,781

1111
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:04,625
I'm in here!

1112
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,161
Come and get me!

1113
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:08,829
I'm in here!

1114
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:12,867
[low growling]

1115
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:37,725
[muffled screams and sobs]

1116
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:40,928
[screaming] Sarah!

1117
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:43,864
[growling]

1118
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:47,101
Sarah!

1119
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:48,703
Emma!

1120
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:55,509
Emma, don't!

1121
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:56,811
Emma!

1122
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:03,084
[muffled screaming and banging]

1123
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,018
Sarah!

1124
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:06,654
[banging and screaming]

1125
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:09,924
[sobbing]

1126
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,793
Sarah. Sarah!

1127
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:17,131
[sobbing]

1128
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:18,265
Sarah!

1129
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:28,075
No!

1130
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:30,811
Sarah!

1131
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:37,051
Emma. Emma, go.

1132
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:38,753
Emma, run,

1133
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:40,054
and don't look back.

1134
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:41,889
Go hide.

1135
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:44,058
Hide, and don't come out
until the sun comes up.

1136
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:45,059
[low growling]

1137
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:46,093
Marley?

1138
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,862
Emma, go!

01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:55,136
[growling]

1140
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,006
Hey!

1141
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,908
Asshole!

1142
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:03,944
Come on.

1143
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:05,046
Come on!

1144
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:20,127
[screaming]

1145
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:21,328
Emma?

1146
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:23,864
Emma...

1147
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:25,966
Marley,
it's after me!

1148
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:27,868
It's after me!

1149
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:29,804
Hey!

1150
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:36,010
Hey!

1151
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:41,716
Take me, you son-of-a-bitch!

1152
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:42,883
[shrieking]

1153
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:44,418
[screams]

1154
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,334
[roaring]

1155
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:09,944
If I'm going to die,

1156
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:11,779
then I'm taking you with me!

1157
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:17,818
[screams]

1158
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:21,849
Marley!

1159
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:25,986
[sobbing] No, no, no....

1160
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:29,824
Marley, please,
please, don't leave me.

1161
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:32,226
Marley, please,
don't leave me all alone!

1162
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,108
You're alive.

1163
01:20:48,143 --> 01:20:50,878
I told you to stay hidden
until the sun was up.

1164
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:51,946
I did.

1165
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,447
It's almost morning.

1166
01:20:55,817 --> 01:20:57,985
You need to go for help.

1167
01:20:58,019 --> 01:20:59,453
No. No, I'm not leaving you.

1168
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:01,989
I need you to bring help.

1169
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:03,157
But...

1170
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:04,959
If I don't get help,

1171
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:06,560
I'm probably going to...

1172
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:08,829
No, don't...
Don't say that, okay?

1173
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,764
I'll... I'll go.

1174
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:15,369
We're going to be okay, Em.

1175
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:18,873
Promise me.

1176
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:23,944
I promise.

1177
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:30,985
[crying]

1178
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:02,149
[branches rustling]

1179
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:21,468
I'm sorry, Em.

1180
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:23,637
[gasps in fear]

1181
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:27,608
Hey!

1182
01:22:27,642 --> 01:22:29,009
The sun is up!

1183
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:30,844
Time to die, you bastard!

1184
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:32,947
Emma, what are you doing? Run!

1185
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:34,014
[shrieking]

1186
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:37,117
[screams]

1187
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:13,988
What are you doing?

1188
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:17,358
We're going home.

1189
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:22,463
[groaning in pain]

1190
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:23,497
[gasping]

1191
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:30,804
[♪♪♪]
