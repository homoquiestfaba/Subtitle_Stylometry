1
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,713
<i>Where's the Captain, Mr Spock?</i>

2
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,597
<i>He's out there, Doctor.</i>

3
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,753
<i>Out there somewhere in</i>
<i>a thousand cubic parsecs of space.</i>

4
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,276
<i>And there is absolutely nothing</i>
<i>we can do to help him.</i>

5
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,150
<i>Bogey inbound,</i>
<i>500 miles from Rockport.</i>

6
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,073
- Roger, tac-com. You got it too?
- What is it?

7
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,789
I don't know. Signal has it
at 500 miles, inbound real fast.

8
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,679
That's not one of ours.

9
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,876
<i>We've confirmed inbound bogey.</i>

10
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,270
Werewolf, flight camera's now on.

11
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,236
Man, is he moving!
Unidentified aircraft,

12
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,595
<i>you are violating</i>
<i>restricted airspace.</i>

13
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,750
<i>Reduce speed to mach one.</i>

14
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,913
<i>Descend to 3,000 feet and identify,</i>
<i>or we will force you down.</i>

15
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,436
Bogey not responding.
He's walking away fast.

16
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,034
Suggest Air National Guard intercept.

17
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,636
This is Cowboy. I got a lock-on.
Request permission to fire.

18
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,438
<i>You are cleared to fire.</i>

19
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,037
Mebs, you should've activated
the cloaking device.

20
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,315
I cannot remember everything!

21
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,154
He's disappeared.
He's just disappeared!

22
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,634
Greetings.

23
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,956
- You need a room?
- Correct.

24
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,919
Fill out an application.
Just a form.

25
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,355
I seek out techno-industrial sector

26
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,591
where I can purchase
two simlats of platinum paste.

27
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,435
This time of night, huh?
Gee, let's see.

28
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,190
See, I'm kinda new to the area.

29
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,195
Where can I obtain a helium grafting
device operable at eight fathoms?

30
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,796
The day guy knows this area
really good. I can't help you.

31
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,988
- Is this a double occupancy?
- Correct. That is my mate.

32
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,038
Yeah, right. I'm sure she is.

33
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,794
That's... That's fine. OK.

34
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,593
Will that be cash or charge?

35
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,032
How will you pay for the room?

36
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,829
We shall remunerate
with metallic tender-discs.

37
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,070
- Correct.
- This is fine.

38
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,152
This is a primitive device.

39
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,789
We need one with the right components
to contact Remulak.

40
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,270
The Highmaster
will be displeased about our ship.

41
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,990
Affirmative. He will surely
cut off my plarg and hand it to me.

42
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,753
But do not despair.
We will be rescued.

43
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,592
Until then, we must adapt.

44
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,114
When the hydrogen droplets
have ceased,

45
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,670
we will live undetected
amongst the blunt skulls.

46
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,151
Beldar, how can we live
among the blunt skulls?

47
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,832
We will blend in.

48
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,512
<i>My goodness, Mike Sanders. Wow.</i>

49
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,195
<i>Here's the man</i>
<i>that made it happen last match.</i>

50
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,914
Hey, Otto, this dude's
almost as fast as you are.

51
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,280
No, this boy is the best.
Shows up on time,

52
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,399
gives me an honest day's work.
You can't find people like this.

53
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,754
That's right.

54
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,913
White boys and the brothers
show up late, loaf around.

55
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,798
- All they want is a cheque.
- I heard that.

56
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,597
Here is your Superjuicemaster.
Frequent cleaning of blades

57
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,592
will prevent wear
and accumulation of bacteria.

58
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,713
I told you, he's good.

59
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,156
If I could find three more like him,
I could retire.

60
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,836
It is time for midday cessation of
activities for protein-carbo intake.

61
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,959
- Sure. Take your lunch break.
- Lunch. Lunch.

62
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,632
The boy loves to eat.

63
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,113
Lunch. Lunch.

64
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,712
Greetings, earthwoman.

65
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,917
Time for midday consumption
of mass quantities.

66
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,594
I have re-radiated
leftover starch disc.

67
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,432
Pizza. I will enjoy it.

68
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,156
There. Warning. Do not sear
the top of your neck hole

69
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,357
in the molten lactate extract
of hoofed mammals.

70
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,630
Excellent. The final component
for the intergalactic communicator.

71
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,709
Correct.

72
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,190
There.

73
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,317
Perhaps tighten
the spiral dimension fasteners.

74
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,630
Beldar, activate the device!

75
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,075
Inform Marlax of our situation.

76
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,720
There is no advantage to delay.

77
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,153
Verscrub.

78
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,909
Phone home!

79
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,759
Omglath Marlax.

80
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,634
<i>We haven't heard from you</i>
<i>in clarsogs.</i>

81
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,314
<i>I'm glad your life functions</i>
<i>are active.</i>

82
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,719
Greetings, Marlax.

83
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,792
<i>I trust you have enslaved the planet.</i>

84
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,158
Unanticipated failure
of mentaglion drive

85
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,119
has caused us to
abandon our vessel in a fluid mass.

86
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,397
At what time coordinates
can we expect a rescue vessel?

87
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,358
<i>Rescue vessel? You tarpaath!</i>

88
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,716
<i>I'd not like to be in your cone</i>
<i>when the Highmaster hears this.</i>

89
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,395
<i>He will not take it lightly.</i>
<i>I'll arrange for a starcruiser</i>

90
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,438
<i>to enter your solar system</i>
<i>in seven zerls.</i>

91
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,111
Seven zerls!

92
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,712
<i>Flargans. Remulak. Narpail.</i>

93
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,916
Marlax, wait!

94
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,911
Seven zerls!

95
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,951
We should discuss something

96
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,112
that is far more important
than planetary conquest.

97
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,352
What could be more important
than planetary conquest?

98
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,069
Beldar, I am with Cone.

99
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,751
You? I? A young one?

100
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,831
Affirmative.

101
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,597
$8,000. This is the best week
I've ever had.

102
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,310
- And there's 1,200 for you, Beldar.
- Thank you.

103
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,393
You still haven't given me
your social security number.

104
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,115
My social security number?
I am sorry. I keep forgetting.

105
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,954
I need it. I got state payroll forms,
workman's comp.

106
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,393
You do have a number?

107
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,278
Of course.
I am a citizen of this planet.

108
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,033
Alright, my man, give me the numbers.

109
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,554
O... two... five...

110
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,993
...six...

111
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,868
...X point three...

112
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,512
...O... B...

113
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,591
...eight...

114
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,428
...seven...

115
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,478
You don't have
a social security number?

116
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,073
Correct.

117
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,073
- Why not?
- I am an illegal alien.

118
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,796
I knew you were too good to be true!

119
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,111
Every time I make money,
this happens. Where you from?

120
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,829
The planet Remulak.
I am Fuel Survey Underlord for...

121
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,911
Never mind.

122
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,471
Look, we'll work this out.

123
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,518
Here's the deal.
Your name is Donald R De Cicco.

124
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,999
Donald R De Cicco.

125
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,674
That's you. D-E capital-C-l-C-C-O.

126
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,116
Born August 11th, 1951,
in Brockton, Massachusetts.

127
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,272
- Brockton.
- And your name is?

128
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,158
- Donald R De Cicco.
- Right. Nice to see you.

129
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,276
Your wife is Mary Margaret Rowney,

130
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,828
born June 26th, 1955,
in Rhode Island.

131
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,831
- You're from where?
- Brockton.

132
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,638
My mother's from there!

133
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,473
You were married
June 4th, 1975, in Greece,

134
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,155
where you met after your graduation
from Hobart College.

135
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,596
- Hobart.
- Hobart College.

136
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,558
He's a wizard.
Everything you need is here.

137
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,269
Birth certificates, school records,
employers' addresses,

138
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,035
grandmother's maiden name.
They won't ask, but it's there.

139
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,869
And social security numbers. Name?

140
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,109
Donald R De Cicco.

141
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,715
Nice to meet you.
Welcome to the United States.

142
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,597
Right there. Up and down.

143
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,511
This is a fine craft.
It can be operated with ease.

144
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,831
Not so close, alright?

145
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,356
I'm not against closeness,
it's just not my thing.

146
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,274
In America, we got this thing
called space. There you go.

147
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,753
If you're gonna live here
and have kids, get yourself together.

148
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,276
Buy yourself a car,
maybe get a hat for that head.

149
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,033
And do something about those teeth.

150
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,670
You know what the key to success is?

151
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,749
I do not.

152
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,230
I'm gonna tell you.
Look good. Be your own boss.

153
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,552
Never get chained to a desk. When it
comes to business, take cash only.

154
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,949
Look good, be own boss,

155
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,156
no desk, cash only.

156
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,196
You got it.

157
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,714
- Got any more of that gum?
- Of course.

158
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,674
But if I chew and drive
I might hit something.

159
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,757
Please, I'm better with English.
All I'm getting is clicking noises.

160
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,195
Clicking?

161
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,078
Could you be a lamb
and have a seat?

162
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,348
Take-o uno seataro, por favor.

163
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,551
Hi, there. I'll take that.

164
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,475
Mr Seedling can't see anyone.
He's having one of those days.

165
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,556
Isn't that cute?
OK, that's not yours.

166
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,991
Bear in mind
these figures are not to scale.

167
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,074
I suggest we put electronic collars
on all the deportees.

168
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,789
We bury a wire along the border,
forming an invisible fence.

169
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,715
The next time this illegal
tries to enter the country...

170
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,117
A jolt he won't soon forget.
It'll send a nice message

171
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,478
to the rest of the population.
Let's get on this.

172
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,559
Why am I the only one
who sees the problem?

173
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,868
I don't know.

174
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,350
Everyone else hopes the problem
will go away. It won't.

175
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,590
You're right. It won't disappear.

176
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,511
- Maybe I should give up.
- No.

177
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,672
- Sure. Be like everybody else.
- It's not you.

178
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,070
- Let the country be overrun.
- You wouldn't be happy.

179
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,755
That's why I have
to give it everything. 100 percent.

180
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,912
- Everyone thinks it's crazy.
- And obsessive.

181
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,958
- That I'm a mental case.
- Completely insane.

182
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,676
I have something for you.

183
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,149
That deceased SSI number
you flagged.

184
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,994
De Cicco's back. That's
the tenth job he's taken this month.

185
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,153
Not bad for a guy who was shot dead
in a clam bar in Sheepshead Bay.

186
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,153
Now Mr De Cicco is working
as an appliance repairman.

187
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,519
Let's see. Donald De Ciccos
one through five turned out to be

188
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,513
a Samoan, a Vietnamese,
a Sicilian, a Canadian...

189
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,309
- And a Belgian.
- He skipped back to Belgium.

190
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,150
I lost him, Eli. This one I want.

191
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,793
Dr Rudolph,

192
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,874
this is Mr De Cicco. He wants
his teeth capped. All of them.

193
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,390
OK. We'll just take a look.

194
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,150
Hello, Mr De Sicko.

195
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,231
De Cicco. The name is De Cicco.

196
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,598
I'm Dr Rudolph. Can we send
for your regular dental records?

197
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,429
When I was young,
I chipped a tooth horn

198
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,556
on my rocket sled in a vurl storm.

199
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,269
But there were no records
which we could send

200
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,158
from where... we come from.

201
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,671
Alright.

202
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,594
Now, I understand
you want to have your teeth capped.

203
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,355
- Correct.
- Let's just take a look.

204
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,516
And open, please.

205
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,230
And close, please.

206
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,594
And open, please.

207
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,112
OK, we'll start the caps
right about here, Mr De Fasco.

208
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,997
De Cicco.

209
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,871
And open wider,

210
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,952
if you can.

211
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,629
- Headrest comfortable?
- Fine.

212
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,510
Alright. I'm going to give you
some nitrous oxide.

213
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,273
If you feel any pain, let me know.

214
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,715
And breathe.

215
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,229
Beldar!

216
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,118
Mebs!

217
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,833
Human authority figures!

218
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,111
We must egress immediately.

219
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,909
They are at the portal.
We are scrabnord!

220
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,151
INS! Open up!

221
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,508
Go round the back.

222
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,639
There they go!

223
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,072
Egress!

224
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,157
Turnbull!

225
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,032
OK. No foreign passports,
letters, newspapers.

226
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,509
Nothing to indicate
their country of origin,

227
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,431
except these Mardi Gras suits.

228
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,432
Let me see. Maybe they're Brazilian.

229
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,953
Sir?

230
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,713
It'd be better
if that went through me.

231
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,394
He's not in a good mood. Thanks.

232
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,471
I think I found something, sir.

233
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,994
That symbol also appears
on this card.

234
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,073
Let me see that.

235
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,318
- Possibly Korean.
- Possibly.

236
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,994
- Have this text analysed.
- OK. Run this.

237
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,594
Look at this filth. It's filthy.

238
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,399
Human beings don't live like this.

239
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,789
- Find out where they're from.
- On it.

240
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,030
Because wherever that is...

241
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,070
...I'm seeing to it
that they go back there.

242
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,229
LaGuardia Airport. Delta terminal.

243
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,952
Do you wish I take the BQE,
the Van Wyck,

244
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,077
or Woodhaven Boulevard
to Grand Central Parkway?

245
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,515
There are more lights
but less traffic.

246
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,273
- Whatever. Just get there.
- Woodhaven.

247
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,635
345, drop-off, LaGuardia.

248
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,718
- Greetings.
- Greetings, my geneto-mate.

249
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,475
How was your day
ferrying humans across the grid?

250
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,438
Acceptable.
Tips could have been better.

251
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,955
The impending Cone
prepares for its emergence.

252
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,796
It's Khoudri. Welcome,
my employer and landlord.

253
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,112
Forgive my intrusion. Ravi is sick.
Can you work the midnight shift?

254
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,792
- Use my car.
- Certainly.

255
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,589
But it will be the last triple shift.
The birth spasm is near.

256
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,036
Beldar, once again
you have pulled me from the fire.

257
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,439
Yes.

258
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,072
You worked through
your slar phase again.

259
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,037
Guz deprivation is not good.

260
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,032
But this dwelling
is no longer acceptable.

261
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,271
Even by earth standards
it is not good enough.

262
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,830
We must move to a safer
neighbourhood with better schools

263
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,674
and a stronger economic matrix
which will not tax us to death.

264
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,911
We are no better off
than we were two zerls ago.

265
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,719
This dwelling is available
at $6,900 down

266
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,553
with a nine percent
fixed-rate mortgage.

267
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,949
Our currency stock is insufficient.

268
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,430
Incorrect. You have been working.
I have been saving.

269
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,717
Ah, I praise you, earthwoman.

270
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,153
My pluvarb has broken.
The birth spasm has begun.

271
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,916
Nothing to this. Childbirth
is a gentle act of nature.

272
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,468
We'll get plenty of good pictures.

273
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,830
I hate you, Beldar. I hate you!

274
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,834
Two, three...

275
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,069
Swab.

276
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,396
- Breathe easy.
- One good push.

277
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,671
It's so cute!

278
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,117
Would you like to cut
the umbilical cord, Mr Conehead?

279
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,637
No. No hair. Bring the top
of the head up higher.

280
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,788
No, higher, like a point.

281
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,310
We have the analysis from the labs
on the card found at the dwelling.

282
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,951
No known language within the foreign
catalogue nationality encodes.

283
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,270
You're not listening to me.

284
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,751
Look, here. See where my hand is?
That high. What else?

285
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,990
The Mardi Gras costumes

286
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,356
contain fibres
with five unknown polymer strands.

287
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,237
Nothing like it anywhere.

288
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,154
What are they saying?
They're from another planet?

289
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,993
That theory has been advanced.

290
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,074
This is big. This is really big.

291
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,517
Aren't creatures from another planet
Air Force responsibility?

292
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,549
If they're just visiting, sure.

293
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,235
But the moment they try
to work here, they're mine.

294
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,559
- Any sign?
- No, sir. Nothing yet.

295
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,516
Wait.

296
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,599
- Subject vehicle coming your way.
- Copy. I have him in sight.

297
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,272
- Go?
- No.

298
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,438
- Go?
- No.

299
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,314
- Now?
- Go!

300
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,111
Freeze!

301
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,634
This isn't him! What's going on here?

302
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,359
- Look.
- Where'd you get this key chain?

303
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,876
It's a gift, from one of
the finest men I've ever known.

304
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,475
- Where is he now?
- He moved out a week ago.

305
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,198
I have no word from him.

306
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,113
I only wish I had more drivers
like him.

307
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,988
Diligent, punctual,
his cab invariably sweet smelling.

308
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,513
- Take him in and check him out.
- Check him.

309
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,037
Find this insignia,
find these illegals.

310
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,317
Hi, there. I'll take that. Thank you.

311
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,396
Sir, good news from Washington.
Your promotion came through.

312
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,359
They must've loved
your electrified-border idea.

313
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,319
On-site Field Enforcement Head
for the entire Southwest.

314
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,630
Assistant Deputy Commissioner.

315
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,995
That should pay quite a bit more.

316
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,278
It's an extra 1,500 a year.
Of course I'll take it.

317
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,354
Question. About this De Cicco case.
We've invested so many man hours.

318
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,193
Who cares?
Let the next guy handle it.

319
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,154
Morning consumption
of mass quantities.

320
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,710
Grid-like breakfast slabs,
seared strips of swine flesh

321
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,394
and flat chicken embryos.
I will enjoy it.

322
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,472
A seven-letter word for a tomb
in ancient Egypt

323
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,870
which has smooth,
sloping sides meeting in an apex?

324
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,520
A flindar.

325
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,432
- Good morning, parental units.
- Dawn greetings.

326
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,839
What would you like?

327
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,151
Pop Tarts? Chicken embryos?
Ground animal flesh?

328
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,196
I'm not hungry. Just some Tang.

329
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,158
Tang. The drink
the astronauts took to the moon.

330
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,912
Astronauts to the moon.

331
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,229
Your putter has arrived.

332
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,437
My Hawk True Flex Power Point
with graphite shaft.

333
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,308
A secret of golf pros everywhere.
A truly manly putter.

334
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,639
- What have you done to your cone?
- Nothing.

335
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,039
No? Turn around.

336
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,192
- It's not a real tattoo.
- Mebs! Unacceptable!

337
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,111
Everyone's wearing decals.

338
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,078
If everyone jumped into
a cauldron, would you?

339
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,878
I am not a little Cone now.

340
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,590
Maintain low tones with me. Go to
the hygienic chamber and remove it.

341
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,069
Also, you have
too much lip enhancement.

342
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,072
Mom! My make-up looks OK, doesn't it?

343
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,073
Do not involve the approval
of your other parental unit.

344
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,799
If you wish to go
to the retail compound,

345
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,270
make the necessary corrections
and remove the decal.

346
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,358
Fine.

347
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,753
She looked like a common flathrag
on payday.

348
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,431
I don't know what went wrong
with these roses.

349
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,272
Maybe I need a gardener.

350
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,875
Sweetie, I'm not gonna pay some guy
to dig in the dirt.

351
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,788
I told you to take that thing to
a professional. You'll save money.

352
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,111
I should've bought
an electric one.

353
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,191
Beldar, is that you?

354
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,955
- Correct.
- Bel. Pry.

355
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:27,034
The damn lawnmower won't start.
You're so good with machinery.

356
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,078
- Would you mind taking a look?
- I do not mind.

357
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,709
Greetings, Lisa. Excellent crop
of decorative growth.

358
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,756
- You're being nice.
- Yes.

359
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,789
Three-horsepower internal-combustion
chlorophyll-stalk slicer.

360
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,440
- There is fuel in the device?
- Plenty.

361
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,193
I just can't get
the damn thing to kick over.

362
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,034
Join us for consumption
of mass quantities this weekend.

363
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,192
We'll ignite our flame pit
and char mammal flesh.

364
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,636
Sounds fun. I'll make some coleslaw.

365
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,473
Coleslaw? We will enjoy it.

366
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,718
Thanks, Bels.

367
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,434
Connie! How are you?

368
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,513
- I love your hat.
- Hi, Mr Conehead.

369
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,718
I love this song!

370
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,630
- Sorry, it's not ready.
- I do not understand.

371
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,429
I have returned at the agreed-upon
time coordinates.

372
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,433
- I'm very sorry, Mr Conhead.
- The name is Conehead.

373
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,590
Well, look, Mr... Conehead,
we got a little backed up

374
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,989
and it took longer than expected.

375
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,675
Unacceptable. You delayed
my departure from here,

376
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,833
and all the events which were
to follow. Why this deception?

377
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,390
I don't know who you are
or where you're from...

378
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,471
France. We come from France.

379
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,348
Fine. The point is,
it'll be ready when it's ready.

380
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,432
So if you wanna take a seat
over there,

381
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,876
we'll call you
when your car's finished.

382
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,793
I will comply.
What choice do I have?

383
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,429
It's as if you have seized me
at the base of my snarglies.

384
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,992
- Hey, Ronnie?
- What?

385
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,232
How can it take so long to do
a simple alignment on a sedan

386
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,151
with standard steering

387
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,756
when your garage is equipped
with a digital hydraulic radiometer?

388
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,198
Maybe cos I was out back
finishing a beer.

389
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,712
OK.

390
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,391
Before we can recommend
your appointment as Commissioner,

391
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,076
we have questions regarding
your tenure as District Chief.

392
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,118
Senator, that was long ago,
and a busy office.

393
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,555
I won't be able to recall everything.

394
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,077
We won't be asking you about
everything. Just case 889343B.

395
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,958
The so-called De...

396
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,474
- De Cicco.
- De Cicco file.

397
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,949
Yes, I do remember that case.

398
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,795
In an unsuccessful pursuit,
you authorised the expenditure

399
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,678
of $250,000 to apprehend
what you believed

400
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,231
was an illegal alien
from another planet. A spaceman.

401
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,031
Excuse me.

402
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,911
Actually, I never said on the record
that I thought they were spacemen.

403
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,109
And the case is still open.

404
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,397
I feel that when we make
this apprehension,

405
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,157
the expense will be well justified...
is what I feel.

406
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,389
My appointment is being held up
by that De Cicco case!

407
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,595
I know.

408
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,116
I want the file put back
into the system, flagged red.

409
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,838
- Why me?
- I don't know.

410
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,435
The system screws the guy
that works the hardest.

411
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,512
- Politicians don't care.
- It's the system.

412
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,750
- Phone's ringing.
- All the time.

413
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,071
- No, Eli.
- The phone! I'll get it.

414
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,238
This guy's out there somewhere.
He's gonna make a mistake.

415
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,630
And when he does, we'll nail him.

416
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,912
I've never dated a girl
taller than me before.

417
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,991
Really? I've always been tall.

418
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,514
Are both your parents from Europe?

419
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,918
- When did they come to America?
- Before I was born.

420
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,514
My grandfather's
from the old country.

421
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,033
Really? Which one?

422
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,839
I'm not sure. One of the big ones.

423
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,718
My mom's the only other woman
I've ever known

424
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,598
who could take a sandwich like that.

425
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,831
- Are you gonna eat that?
- No.

426
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,073
You're something special,
you know that?

427
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,833
So Beldar's giving this woman
beginner's driving lessons

428
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,469
for the fifth time, huh?
That's interesting.

429
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,551
Why is that interesting?

430
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,758
I mean, the same woman.
Think about it.

431
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,319
The same woman.

432
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,871
The more you think about it, the
more you probably should worry,

433
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,077
because all men are pigs.

434
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,516
Pigs. A domesticated
cloven-hoofed vertebrate

435
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,478
that defecates
in the same place it consumes.

436
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,236
Exactly. You should be
very careful with Beldar.

437
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,872
He's got that Continental accent
that some women find irresistible.

438
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,029
I like it when you watch me drive.

439
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,073
- Watch it, lady!
- It's funny.

440
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,993
It's like you've been instructing me
all my life.

441
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,712
Yes.

442
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,590
It's almost as if you've
controlled me completely.

443
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,035
I just don't think I'm ready
for this test yet. I can't...

444
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,712
Listen to me.

445
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,234
I'm OK.

446
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,592
I'm just human.

447
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,234
And weak.

448
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,194
Gladys, look at me.

449
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,508
Yeah!

450
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:03,435
I am your teacher. It is natural
you harbour certain feelings for me.

451
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,035
But you must understand,
nothing can come of this.

452
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,914
58 US dollars, please.

453
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,559
You are one of the finest men
I've ever met.

454
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,949
When my species rules this planet,

455
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,238
your name will be on the protected
rolls. You will come to no harm.

456
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,757
You are wise. But there's a sadness
to your wisdom.

457
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,036
Ronnie, don't.

458
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,633
Please.

459
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,473
Connie,
I told you how I feel about you.

460
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,916
- Doesn't that mean anything?
- It means a lot.

461
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,072
It's like, I pick you up,
I take you out,

462
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,357
I bring you home, we say goodnight

463
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,991
and you never kiss me.
Is there something wrong with me?

464
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,071
Of course not.

465
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,631
It's just...

466
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,829
My parental units...

467
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,669
We've never been really affectionate.

468
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,194
I'm afraid I don't know how.

469
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,838
It's easy.

470
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,708
All you do is lean forward and kiss,
like this.

471
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,752
Ronnie, don't.

472
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,310
- I am not ready.
- You're ready!

473
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,119
Don't.

474
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,277
Greetings.

475
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,828
How was your date with Ronnie?

476
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,520
Daddy was right. Earth boys
only care about one thing.

477
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,229
- Ronnie behaved like a flairndep?
- Flairndep?

478
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,233
An uninvited grasper of Cone.
A masher. A hustler.

479
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,271
Flairndep?

480
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,191
Hi, Mr Conehead.

481
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,120
- I find you unacceptable!
- Yes, sir.

482
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,751
If I did not fear incarceration,
I would terminate your life functions

483
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,277
by applying pressure to your
blunt skull to cause its collapse!

484
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,198
Thank you.

485
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,272
Do not worry about Ronnie.

486
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,796
You will not see him in
the Laurel Hills quadrant again.

487
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,111
I can't believe you did that.
You've ruined my life!

488
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,760
Young one,
when we return to Remulak...

489
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,479
I don't care about Remulak!

490
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,439
That stupid starcruiser
is never coming, anyway!

491
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,714
But she said... I thought...

492
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,268
I will attend to the young one.

493
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,111
Come in.

494
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,036
I read in a magazine
you can talk to me about anything.

495
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,071
Mom?

496
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,591
What does it feel like to... hone?

497
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,631
Well, for me, the first time,

498
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,156
it happened so fast,
I hardly knew I had honed at all.

499
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,710
After that it was more repetition
than anything else.

500
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,954
My young one, your cone
is changing and you feel unsure.

501
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,679
How would you know what it's like?

502
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,399
You've been married to Daddy
for so long.

503
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,789
I was a young Cone myself, once.

504
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,873
Before I met Beldar, I was
attracted to a Thorasian forger.

505
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,556
As far as I was concerned, no other
life force in the universe mattered.

506
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,633
But then he got a job working
at a volcano complex on a moon.

507
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:02,236
I never saw him again.
It broke my blood-valve chamber.

508
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,514
I got over it.

509
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,309
It worked out for the best,
because then I met your father.

510
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,233
I knew then
that I had found my true life mate.

511
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,993
I love you, Mom.

512
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,750
The currents of chromo-bonding

513
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,674
between you
and your parental units are infinite.

514
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,159
Mebs!

515
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,599
Good shot.

516
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,879
So, have you given any thought to
what I said about, you know, hair?

517
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,473
I do not understand.

518
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,314
It's me. You don't have
to pretend it doesn't bother you.

519
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,598
You're young. No reason
for you to be skinny up top.

520
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,309
I'll let you in on a secret.
It's not all my own hair.

521
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,234
- Hard to tell, isn't it?
- Only from very high altitudes.

522
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,791
I'll say no more. Think it over.

523
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,394
- I can introduce you to my man.
- Thank you.

524
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,595
Mr Conehead!

525
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,399
Way to blast out of the bunker, huh?

526
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,595
It's me, Ronnie!

527
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,676
Hope you didn't cut your hand when
you tore open my car! I'm fine!

528
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,752
Yes, thank you! No problem!
Goodbye!

529
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,832
- OK.
- Chubby, come on!

530
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,668
OK, Conehead. That puts me
four behind you at the turn.

531
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,749
Correct.

532
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:50,515
Mr Conehead, I'm miserable.
I feel so bad for what I did.

533
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:55,230
It feels like somebody's ripping my
guts out. She won't take my calls.

534
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,669
Hey, kid, I'm not paying you to yak.
Buddy?

535
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,152
What's with the head?

536
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,318
Forget him. He's not a member.

537
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,712
<i>That concludes</i>
<i>the one-metre competition.</i>

538
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,633
<i>Next, the three-metre-board category.</i>

539
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,030
<i>First diver for the home team,</i>
<i>Connie Conehead.</i>

540
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,076
A one-and-a-half flip.

541
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,675
Enter the water
with as little splash as possible.

542
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,832
Good girl. Keep it up.
You've got one more dive.

543
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,718
<i>Diving for Union High, Gale Jenson.</i>

544
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,998
You were great.
I'm sorry about the other night.

545
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,629
I was a real jerk! OK?

546
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,557
Connie's our best hope
for the state finals.

547
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,552
Correct. We believe this also.

548
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,191
I don't think I've ever seen you
at any of the parent meetings.

549
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,078
What committees are you on?

550
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,436
We still need volunteers
for the homecoming gala.

551
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,476
- Home...
- Coming...

552
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:50,949
Hi.

553
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,349
Look, I'm sorry if I...

554
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,670
No. I shouldn't have been so...

555
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,876
It was me. Sometimes I just...

556
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,951
Me, too.

557
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,911
- If I thought I did anything...
- No, you didn't.

558
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,389
- I mean it.
- Seriously?

559
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,391
Yeah.

560
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,155
Wow! I'm glad we talked.

561
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,392

564
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,154
Careful there, Conehead.

565
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,870
Pretty cheap, Conehead.

566
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,673
Cigar?

567
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,278
Is the light keeping you awake?

568
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,351
No.

569
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,956
Your breathing has become erratic.
A torg for your thoughts.

570
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,998
Beldar, are you content with me?

571
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,029
Of course. Why would I not be?

572
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,112
Now, I would like
to enter my slar phase.

573
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,230
Let us suppose
my life functions ceased.

574
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,153
- What would you do?
- Incinerate your carcass

575
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,595
in the tradition
of Ovahdar the Obtuse

576
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,148
and put it in a clean, dry place.

577
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,435
Would you find a new geneto-mate

578
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,752
to bring to our guz chamber
and propagate?

579
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,310
Ah, my most precious one,
I would collapse.

580
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,312
I would draw the shades
and live in the dark.

581
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,550
I would never leave my slar pad.

582
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,474
My fluids would coagulate, my cone
would shrivel and I would die,

583
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,236
miserable and Ionely.
The stench would be great.

584
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,280
You have made me very happy.

585
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,715
Yes, I know. Goodnight.

586
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,910
Life on earth is good.

587
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,676
I agree. Stability and contentment
have been achieved.

588
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,233
Lay by and put about.

589
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,595
Return to your port of embarkation.

590
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,672
There is no work for you
in the United States.

591
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,072
You have no job skills,
you will be a drag on our economy.

592
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,312
We appreciate your situation
but we have problems of our own.

593
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,551
- Thank you.
- Phone, sir.

594
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,875
Seedling here.

595
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,520
A fax came through
on the secure channel.

596
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,795
I think we've found him.

597
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:43,075
Don't toy with me.
This time it had better be real.

598
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,273
Hello, Mrs Conehead.
I've been meaning to talk to you

599
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,318
about the
Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony.

600
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,631
We've found someone else
to head up that committee

601
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,110
and won't need
Mr Conehead's services after all.

602
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,715
- If you could thank him for me.
- He will be disappointed.

603
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,158
I'm telling you, Bels,
you could win that trophy this year.

604
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:45,552
A meaningless piece of metal
and wood. I compete only with myself.

605
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,518
I appreciate the game
for its physics, skill,

606
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,115
its self-control
and, of course, spirituality.

607
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,952
You're full of it.

608
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,917
You're only coming to the ball

609
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,515
because you think you got a shot
at winning that trophy.

610
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,591
Negative. But if I should win,

611
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,275
I would accept it
with limited enthusiasm.

612
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,040
- Ron. Harv.
- What's happening?

613
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,032
What are you wearing
to the Hallowe'en dance?

614
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,714
I am not about to tell you, Harv.

615
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,000
"Consume alco-beverage.
Come get me!"

616
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,116
Ah, mai tai! I will enjoy it.

617
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,830
Greetings, earthman.

618
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,396
It is good to hone in places

619
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,632
other than our guz chamber
before slar phase.

620
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,312
Who said?

621
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,958
<i>Good Housekeeping.</i>

622
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,632
- What are they doing?
- It's like they stepped on a cat.

623
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,512
- Comdec three.
- <i>Commissioner Seedling.</i>

624
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,070
- We're on 'em.
- <i>Don't make a move without me.</i>

625
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,914
I understand. We won't move
until you get here.

626
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,798
Greetings.

627
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,236
Hello. We just stopped by
to introduce ourselves.

628
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,835
- We're Jehovah's Witnesses.
- How do you do? I am Beldar.

629
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,718
We attend the Kingdom Hall
on Cove Neck Road.

630
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,268
Near the dry cleaner's
and the 7-Eleven.

631
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,920
Exactly. May we ask you a question?

632
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,035
Proceed.

633
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,714
Is the world headed towards
a calamity?

634
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,476
Definitely. I have direct
personal knowledge that this is so.

635
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,199
- Great. May we come in?
- Of course.

636
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,316
Enter. Assume comfort.

637
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,839
- My mate, Prymaat.
- Greetings. Be seated.

638
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,749
So, what do you know of the doom
awaiting this planet?

639
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:59,311
As Witnesses, we believe the end
of the world is approaching

640
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,949
and that only 144,000 people
will be saved to reign.

641
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,349
I do not believe
it will be that many.

642
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,479
The Bible clearly states
144,000 will be saved to reign.

643
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,677
Very optimistic, considering
the primitive weapons

644
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,318
the earth people have.

645
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,630
Some earth weapons are not useless.

646
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,709
Mebs, drop it.

647
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,360
Well, when the time comes,

648
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,113
no weapon of this earth
shall avail mankind.

649
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,316
Correct.

650
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,995
- Where are you people from?
- France. We come from France.

651
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,197
But we are American citizens now.

652
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,397
- Do you have proof?
- Proof?

653
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:41,108
Christina's giving me a ride
to the dance, so I'll see you there.

654
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,754
I take it your daughter
was born here.

655
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,719
Yes. She is native to your plan...
country.

656
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:26,830
<i>Scarlab. Modtrubuim. Beldar. Scarlab.</i>

657
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,755
Beldar? Phone for you.

658
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,230
I will return their call
at my earliest convenience.

659
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,788
No, the big phone!

660
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,791
The big phone?

661
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,717
I hope you humans
have enjoyed your visit. Come again.

662
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,633
- You are leaving.
- How did you arrive in the US?

663
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,517
Thank you for coming.

664
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,433
They didn't buy it.

665
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,193
You can't talk religion
with some people.

666
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,433
Connie!

667
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:28,272
Ronnie's giving me a ride home
tonight, so I won't need a ride.

668
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,636
Negative, young lady.
We must speak now. It is imperative.

669
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,035
I have good news, my young one.

670
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,829
Our rescue vessel from Remulak
is coming tonight.

671
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,148
What?

672
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,755
You will finally see
the joys of your planet.

673
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:51,118
- I must tell Ronnie.
- Irrational. You will tell no one.

674
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,509
What if I said I don't want to go?

675
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,956
My infinitely valuable incarnation.

676
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,079
Watching you grow up on this
savage planet has caused me pain.

677
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,914
Your optic receptacles have never
seen the peaks of Aardsnaap,

678
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,798
the Crater of Culdroth,
the Mergziod Labyrinth.

679
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,998
I know, and I'm sure it's all great.

680
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,152
And I know that
you don't believe me,

681
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,389
but I'm in love with Ronnie.

682
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,159
Daddy, if you really care,
you'll let me say goodbye to him.

683
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,915
Although my blood valve
weighs heavily with your feelings,

684
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,117
tonight we must remain together.

685
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,589
You're moving away tonight?

686
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,150
When you get the call to be
the President of France's driver,

687
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,673
you gotta go.

688
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,035
I have to tell you something
really important.

689
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:59,193
- What is it?
- Not here. We have to be alone.

690
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,191
Alright!

691
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,034
The awarding of the club's
Golfer of the Year trophy...

692
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,792
Not so fast, Carl.

693
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,749
...for most-improved handicap
through the season. The winner is

694
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,558
Beldar Conehead!

695
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,479
<i>The daughter and boyfriend</i>
<i>are on the move.</i>

696
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:55,119
Before we do anything at all,
there's something I have to say.

697
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,953
I'm different from other girls.

698
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,873
I know. That's why I love you.

699
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,672
She left because something
has corrupted her judgement.

700
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,709
When we get back to Remulak,
I am grounding her for a zerl!

701
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,637
Senso-rings?
Where did you get those?

702
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,435
Under your bed.

703
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,114
Unacceptable!
Your cone is too young!

704
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,668
Get up! You're coming
to Remulak now!

705
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,432
I am staying with Ronnie!

706
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,433
Maintain low tones. Impossible.
Undesirable. Inadvisable.

707
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,034
Then I'm coming with you.
I love you.

708
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,351
Mebs! Human authority figures.

709
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,670
We must egress immediately.

710
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,272
It's over, Conehead. This is the INS.

711
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:16,035
Come out with your hands up.
You're under arrest.

712
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,716
They're going for it!

713
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:49,197
- Cover him.
- Hold it right there!

714
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,635
- <i>It's the boyfriend.</i>
- It's the boyfriend.

715
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,829
Daddy!

716
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,796
Nice manoeuvre,
but it's all over.

717
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:20,074
I think
that is the Jehovah's Witness.

718
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,397
Let's cover him.

719
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,592
Hold on, everybody.

720
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,316
I love you, Ronnie!

721
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,799
I love you!

722
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,235
Back in the car, asshole.

723
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,992
Gorman, let go!

724
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,916
I'm scared!

725
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,599
You're not getting away this time.
You're surrounded.

726
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,430
Put the car down!

727
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,318
<i>This is the Captain.</i>

728
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,359
Get into the formplat. We will
initiate mentaglion surge

729
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,910
once we go past the only moon
on this planet.

730
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:10,798
No problem. We have successfully
passed their moon

731
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,634
and are preparing now
for mentaglion surge.

732
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,631
Remulak!

733
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:37,555
Vlenglariat pla, Highmaster.
I know every Cone is allowed

734
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,509
but four uses of the Bitumius
pleasure spool, and I partook six.

735
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:47,116
I realise the error of these actions.
They will never be repeated.

736
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,476
I throw myself at your mertex.
Fairnob, smerthail.

737
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,356
Smordit.

738
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:56,150
I realise the pleasure spools
are a difficult temptation to resist.

739
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,630
Therefore, you will
knarftle the garthok!

740
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,792
No!

741
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:11,229
Fuel Survey Underlord Beldar
Florhone, and Marlax Zehemsto,

742
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,357
from Protoid Fuel Administration.

743
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,510
Beldar, survivor
of the wilderness planet.

744
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,717
What do you bring me
from the conquered worldlet?

745
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,392
Greetings, Revered One.

746
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,075
I present the gift of two
living native beings from the planet.

747
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,839
Do what you want to me, but I won't
apologise for doing my job.

748
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:48,959
The USA cannot solve the
employment problems of the universe.

749
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,429
Silence the slave!

750
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:00,032
Delightful. They will make
a fitting sacrifice to Krathnor.

751
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,236
What else did you bring me?

752
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,153
A multitude of gifts
from the blunt skulls.

753
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,832
A tyre iron with four-way lug wrench.

754
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:18,390
An owner's manual
for a Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable.

755
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,357
Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable?

756
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,557
A personal conveyance,
named for its inventor,

757
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,279
a mythical character,
and a small mammal.

758
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:29,158
And a dashboard icon.

759
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,068
- Is this all?
- Certainly not.

760
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,792
Some... chewing gum.

761
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:58,438
I am sporfed. More than sporfed.
Flarged by this!

762
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,111
Come close.

763
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,798
Close.

764
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,993
What have you done
to your face portal?

765
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,878
Your trelgs!

766
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,032
Beldar lived among
the blunt heads so long,

767
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:25,829
he had to adapt to survive.
He offered his trelgs.

768
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,309
It is known as dental bonding.

769
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,073
I do not care
what the blunt skulls call it.

770
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:35,073
- Here, it is known as treason.
- Treason?

771
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:40,029
It is at my discretion to settle
things in the ancient ways.

772
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:45,640
Therefore
you will knarftle the garthok!

773
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,517
I am no traitor!

774
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,591
What's a garthok?

775
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,798
Every zerl since the ancient times,
when the three moons align,

776
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,395
the light causes a garthok to emerge.

777
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,437
So, what's a garthok?

778
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:14,150
Our seats used to be way up
in the back. These are much better.

779
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,237
That is a garthok?

780
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:48,030
You can really see it from this
vantage. These are very good seats.

781
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,191
It is time.

782
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:00,511
I am Lagtar, disgraced guardsman,
prepared to fight for my honour.

783
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,071
These are great seats.

784
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:12,470
I have learnt much from watching
the garthok battle.

785
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,315
It has weaknesses. When my turn
comes, I believe I can take him.

786
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,915
And let me know
when Elvis gets here.

787
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,558
You're next.

788
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,038
This is a first for me.

789
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,111
- You are next.
- No, he is next.

790
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,839
- No. He said you are next.
- He is next.

791
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,309
You were ahead of me in court.

792
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:44,075
That was then. This is now.
No, guard, no!

793
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,439
You are next.

794
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,957
Daddy!

795
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,439
- It's a song.
- Big hit on earth.

796
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,158
Mebs.

797
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,594
The day is yours, Beldar.

798
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:12,117
You have knarftled the garthok.
Therefore, a request may be granted.

799
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,839
- I have such a request.
- Speak freely.

800
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:17,832
That I be permitted
to return to earth.

801
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:22,357
And, upon my return,
I will conquer the planet earth

802
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:27,195
and enslave the blunt skulls
in the name of my Cone heritage.

803
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,634
Request granted.

804
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:34,439
I wish to take
the earth slaves with me.

805
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,988
Narg! You may only take one slave.

806
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,958
Then I take Seedling,
the one with higher office.

807
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,631
- Thank you.
- So be it!

808
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,999
Let it be written...

809
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,559
Are you writing this?

810
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:53,349
...that Beldar shall return
to the humo-carb planet,

811
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,192
to conquer the blunt skulls!

812
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,877
This is my festival.
Yet I speak and they do not hear.

813
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,188
No one listens.

814
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,670
They do not realise
the difficulties of my office.

815
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,079
Power is not easy.

816
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,436
I sit in judgement and rule.
That is all there is for me.

817
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:21,239
- You have no interior life.
- Highmaster.

818
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:26,519
Why don't you let me take care
of that? He's having a tough day.

819
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,998
<i>Omglath.</i>

820
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,675
Krathnor. Attention
all battle-unit commanders.

821
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,558
Entering outer atmospheres
of target planet.

822
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,548
<i>Hold your global-ranging positions.</i>

823
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:49,838
<i>Array mesoton cannon.</i>
<i>Stand ready for my attack order.</i>

824
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,074
The starfleet has entered
the earth's atmosphere.

825
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,674
They've entered
the earth's atmosphere.

826
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:00,833
- The moment of glory is upon us.
- Really big day for you, sir.

827
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,358
Arm cannon. Verify global targets.

828
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,829
Hold weapons release until my order.

829
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,110
Warning! Danger to battlefleet.

830
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,953
Enemy laser gun
in satellites detected.

831
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,110
<i>Proceed to secondary target.</i>

832
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,191
Lorbsleb. Warning!

833
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,669
Danger to battlefleet!

834
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:49,479
- <i>Lorbsleb!</i>
- Lorbsleb!

835
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,870
Quickly, my family. Run!

836
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,754
Your happiness
and positive perception of me

837
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:14,799
is vital to my existence.
Besides, it is not every day

838
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,348
a father
can give the world to his child.

839
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,078
I love you, Daddy.

840
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,635
Beldar's life functions have ceased.

841
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:31,154
The earth weapons have silenced him.

842
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:35,279
He died bravely in battle.
No death is more glorious.

843
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,839
He will be missed.

844
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:40,435
- He will walk with the chosen.
- Super guy.

845
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:45,916
I make this proposal to you. Your
life in exchange for a green card.

846
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,357
Agreed, if you demonstrate a job
skill that no US citizen possesses.

847
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,351
That is no challenge to me.

848
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,273
- I have no objection.
- Good. Move.

849
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,278
Good evening, Mr Conehead.
Mrs Conehead.

850
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,432
Good evening, Ronnie.
Welcome. Enter.

851
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:18,760
You look handsome yet uncomfortable
in your pubescent ceremonial garb.

852
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,877
- Yeah. You mean my tux?
- Correct.

853
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:26,476
Connie is doing her beautification
ritual. I will summon her.

854
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,870
Ronnie, may I have 55 words with you?

855
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,469
The statistics of young earthlings

856
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,438
mangling themselves in cars
on prom night

857
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,353
makes me insist
on maximum safety awareness.

858
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:44,797
Return at the predesignated
time coordinates, and take my car.

859
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,031
Its reinforced alloy superstructure
is far superior

860
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,634
to that of your rusted-out shit box.

861
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,518
Gee, thanks, Mr Conehead.

862
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,511
Hi, Ronnie. Hi, Daddy.

863
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,195
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

864
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,917
Present yourselves
for image emulsification.

865
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,989
Say "lactate extract
of hoofed mammals".

866
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,832
Cheese!

867
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,719
Excellent.

868
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,070
Goodnight, Mr and Mrs Conehead.

869
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:43,832
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

870
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,797
Night.

871
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:56,673
- Ah, memories!
- We will enjoy them.
