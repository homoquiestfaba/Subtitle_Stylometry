1
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:42,674
-How you doin' bro?
-You seen Melvin?

2
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:47,279
No, man. I ain't seen
that cat in a long time.

3
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,380
Jo-sho.

4
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,349
-He come this way?
-No, man.

5
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,320
Y'all seen Melvin?

6
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:57,389
That crazy white dude?

7
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:57,389
Yeah, white chocolate.

8
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,626
Man, I ain't seen
Melvin in a while.

9
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:04,430
Melvin's somewhere though.

10
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:05,697
He's somewhere
to be found.

11
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,100
But what you looking
for Melvin for?

12
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:09,768
Boy gotta go to court.

13
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,836
He goin' be late.

14
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:10,836
Trouble again, huh?

15
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:14,606
He ain't never gonna get his son
back acting like this, man.

16
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:18,310
He looks like he should stop
doing everything he been doing.

17
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:18,310
They ain't stoppin' shit.

18
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:21,213
-Let me go find his ass.
-Somebody gon' find him.

19
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,816
-A repeat. A repeat.
-Somebody gon' find him.

20
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:25,184
I'll catch y'all
on another side.

21
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:26,185
You take care of yourself.

22
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:27,686
-Alright.
-Alright.

23
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,758
Melvin!

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,327
Where you at, you
mother fucker?

25
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,263
I told y'all.

26
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,666
You wanna make a
movie about Melvin?

27
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:43,102
You gon' to spend half of
your time trying to find

28
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:45,270
this mother fucker.

29
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:45,270
You seen Melvin?

30
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,107
No, I ain't seen
that mother fucker.

31
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,641
Damn!

32
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,577
Hey, if you see him tell
him to head on home!

33
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:52,478
Alright, I got that.

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,779
Alright.

35
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,750
Y'all seen Melvin?

36
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,219
I ain't seen that
mother fucker.

37
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,453
You ain't seen
that mother fucker?

38
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,654
-Who's that?
-Melvin.

39
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,190
-No.
-Ah, shit.

40
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,228
Every mother fucking
time something going on,

41
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,897
this mother fucker
gotta disappear.

42
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:14,299
Melvin!

43
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,268
There's the mother
fucker's bike.

44
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,574
And there's the
mother fucker's shoe.

45
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,414
There's the other shoe.

46
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,317
Attached to this
ig'nant mother fucker.

47
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,419
Melvin!

48
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,622
Get your ass up, man!

49
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,924
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

50
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:41,727
Acting like your ass
is homeless and shit.

51
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,302
-Stole my shoe?
-I found your damn shoe.

52
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:51,637
Oh, yeah? What's it doing
in your hand then?

53
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,539
What the fuck is it
doing off your foot?

54
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,307
It's sitting
right over there.

55
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,942
You look like shit.

56
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,845
Fuck.

57
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,184
I remember the
party and then...

58
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,486
Man, you left about 4 A.M.

59
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:09,755
Just slipped off
into the darkness.

60
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,592
Did I dream it or
did I get with Caroline?

61
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,661
You better hope you didn't
get with that fat bitch.

62
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,863
She two hundred and
fifty pounds, man.

63
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,464
She's kinda foxy though.

64
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,433
That fox don't need to eat
for another three years.

65
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,868
Now, come on, man.

66
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:26,672
That's better.

67
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:30,876
You know you gotta be
in court this morning.

68
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:30,876
What?

69
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,346
You gotta be in
court this morning.

70
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:34,346
Why didn't you
say that earlier?

71
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,282
What the fuck you think I've
been trying to say to you, man?

72
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,417
-Come on, man.
-Fuck.

73
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:38,417
-Shit.
-Damn it, Melvin.

74
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:42,854
Riding around town all god damn
morning looking for your ass.

75
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,356
We gotta go man.
I gotta change.

76
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,657
Yeah, no shit?

77
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,525
Fuck.

78
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,427
Shit, shower, and shave.

79
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,963
Shit, it smell like a pack
of horses coming at a

80
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,698
mother fucker ass first.

81
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,733
How the fuck you
end up over here?

82
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:55,968
I mean, you my brother
and I love you,

83
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,470
but sometimes you do
some silly ass shit.

84
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,738
Fucking thing! Come on!

85
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,473
Man, ride.

86
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,942
Complaining about
you fuckin' up.

87
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,477
The fuck.

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,680
Stupid, Melvin.

89
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:08,680
Fucking stupid.

90
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,650
Yeah, that's what I'm
talking about. Shit.

91
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,688
So you had to stay
out all night, huh?

92
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,027
One of these days.

93
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,562
One of these days.

94
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,930
Ha! One, two, three!

95
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:25,831
Come on!

96
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:26,965
Shit.

97
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,801
Man, I can do this
my god damn self.

98
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:29,801
I'm trying to
help you, man.

99
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:33,305
Do it look like I need
your help, mother fucker?

100
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,506
Well, you are in a
wheelchair, you know?

101
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:35,507
I ain't no spastic.

102
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,508
I never said you were.

103
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,043
You want my help or not?

104
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,711
One of these days I'm
going to get my a new

105
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,914
chair that don't need no skinny
ass to push it up ramps.

106
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:42,914
Will you stop
your moaning?

107
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:48,320
One of those carbon fiber mother
fuckers that do tricks and shit.

108
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,964
Come on, buddy.

109
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,872
You know, you look so handsome
when you make the effort.

110
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,740
I don't understand why you
have to dress like a hobo.

111
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,642
Oh, come on, mom.

112
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,311
How do I look, Luc?

113
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,780
Judge will give you five years
for wearing that cheap suit.

114
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:14,780
-Jesus.
-Lucille, leave him alone.

115
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:18,650
He looks just like he did
on his first day of school.

116
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,652
I was just joking, miss h.

117
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,688
The judge is going
to dig you, bro.

118
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,588
Alright, you wanna
hear my letter?

119
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,588
Sure.

120
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,557
Why not? Lay it on me.

121
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:25,557
Okay.

122
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:29,428
Dear sir, I know I haven't
exactly been the best

123
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,563
father to date, but I'm
here today to tell you

124
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,700
that I can't be a better
father if I'm in prison.

125
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,768
All I want to do is see
my boy again and I'll do

126
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,037
whatever you ask me just to
spend some time with time.

127
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,407
He loves his father
and he needs me.

128
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,443
And if you give me the
chance, I am capable of

129
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:47,879
being a stable and solid
influence in his life.

130
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,581
Now the charge of
kidnapping sounds very

131
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,751
extreme to me because it's
not in fact what happened.

132
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,119
We just wanted to go
on a holiday together,

133
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,355
me and Rex, is all.

134
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,090
Maybe I didn't
handle it right, sir.

135
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,559
I understand, but my ex is
a real pain in the ass--

136
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,628
man, you cannot say that
stuff to the judge, man.

137
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,565
Yeah, you gotta let the
judge decide the rest.

138
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:06,565
Come on, man.

139
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:10,035
Okay, here are your sandwiches
in case it goes on a while.

140
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,970
Crust off for Lucille,
crust on for you.

141
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,705
Okay, great.

142
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:13,705
Hey, good luck, bro.

143
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,708
You look like a fucking
hobo in that suit.

144
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,043
Hey, thanks, sis.

145
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:18,810
Love you.

146
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:19,644
Love you, more.

147
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:20,479
I can do it myself.

148
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:20,479
No, you can't.

149
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,114
Boy, what you think
about the ride?

150
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,382
Oh, it's dope, man.

151
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:23,382
Where'd you get it?

152
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,984
Oh, man, borrowed
it from my uncle.

153
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,919
Know you gotta make a good
impression on that judge, right?

154
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:28,987
A good impression?

155
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,156
What kind of
narcotic you on, son?

156
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,724
-Thanks for doing this, man.
-Anytime!

157
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,059
Hey, miss h,
how we looking?

158
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,627
Like the village people.

159
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:35,627
Love you, ma.

160
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,997
Get out of here
before you're late.

161
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,866
Thank you, miss h!

162
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,467
Courthouse.

163
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,669
Be careful.

164
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,697
I'm running late.
Come on, let's move.

165
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,434
You got this, Melvin.

166
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,436
You got this.

167
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:19,571
Alright.

168
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,573
Hey, kick some ass, bro.

169
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,847
Good luck, man.

170
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:50,001
Hey, man. What happened?

171
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,541
Fucking prick gave me a
community service order.

172
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,246
He banned all contact with
Rex, pending assessment.

173
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:02,714
Well, atleast you didn't
go to jail, right?

174
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,649
Yeah, I wanna
see my kid, man.

175
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,650
Get it?

176
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,219
Fuck!

177
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,156
Aw, what other way
could it have gone?

178
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,691
This stupid bitch.

179
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:13,892
Don't do it, brother.

180
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,160
Thank you.

181
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,062
-No, no, no!
-Mel, Mel!

182
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,232
Feeling good about
yourself, Doreen?

183
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:22,167
So are you gonna tell Rex that
you banned me from seeing him?

184
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,770
Or are you gonna lie like you
normally do and blame it on me?

185
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,672
The judge banned
you, not me.

186
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,974
Yeah, cause you fucking
instructed him.

187
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,209
Melvin, do not
swear at me, okay?

188
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,911
I'm not
intimidated by you.

189
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,846
Those days are past us.

190
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,281
Doreen, please.

191
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,049
Don't do this to me.

192
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,652
You're hurting Rex just as
much as you're hurting me.

193
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,854
I mean, why do you
have to be so cruel?

194
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,124
What did I ever do
to hurt you so bad?

195
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,126
You need reminding.

196
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,562
Please don't do this.

197
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:51,997
It's done, okay?

198
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,899
The judge has
passed it down.

199
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,969
Yeah, well, when Rex is
older, he's gonna hate you

200
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,170
for using him
to get at me.

201
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,072
I am not using him.

202
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,741
I just don't want him to
live amongst the wreckage

203
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,175
that is your life.

204
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,744
Look at you!

205
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,046
You have no manners
and no grace.

206
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,551
And I abhor what
you've become.

207
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,566
Hey.

208
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,988
Yeah!

209
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,189
Woo!

210
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:09,007
That mother fucker George Bush,
sent us over to Iraq in '91.

211
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,376
82nd airborne division.

212
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:13,645
Man, I remember that first push.
We're going through boswa.

213
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,280
We was tripping.

214
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,248
I get hit by this sniper.

215
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,217
Mother fucker tagged
me from behind.

216
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,253
Took out my lower spine.

217
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,630
Love you guys.

218
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:42,073
My wife, she was so
ashamed of having a

219
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,909
husband that the stank
bitch didn't even show up

220
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,746
to fort brag when they
sent my ass home.

221
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:48,913
But Melvin did.

222
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,749
Him and his momma.

223
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,352
Told me I could stay with them
til I got my shit together.

224
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,321
One of these days he's gonna
get his shit together.

225
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:56,321
You know what he said?

226
00:10:56,323 --> 00:11:02,060
He said I could stay with him
til I get back on my feet.

227
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,228
What kinda shit is that?

228
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,262
Back on my feet.

229
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,263
Right.

230
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,900
Jump!

231
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,407
Shit!

232
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,110
You alright, man?

233
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,212
I'm good, I'm
good, I'm good!

234
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,952
I'm good.
Baby, I'm good.

235
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,359
Lucas is here.

236
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,927
What?

237
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,696
Lukey!

238
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,065
With his
spectacles and all.

239
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:43,001
Yeah, lukey!

240
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,371
The mother fucking
science teacher.

241
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,139
What's up, bro?
How you doing, man?

242
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,822
Melvin is not like
other people.

243
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:07,058
Ever since we were kids,
we came to discover he had

244
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,427
um, abilities to move
objects using only the

245
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,329
power of his mind.

246
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:11,329
Okay, so um...

247
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:14,933
On first glance, if
you look at both heads,

248
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,202
you don't see
anything different.

249
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:20,972
Now, let's look at
Melvin's again.

250
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:26,010
Here, we start to notice
very small anomalies on

251
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,146
the outer sleeve
of the brain.

252
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,782
That's about the only thing
that I see that's different.

253
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:30,782
And I've been...

254
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:33,952
I've studied this guy
for over a decade.

255
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:36,154
Everything else about
him reads normal.

256
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:40,291
I run tests on every other part
of his body and found nothing.

257
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:43,328
Now, Mel he comes in from time
to time and we check to,

258
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,363
you know, to see if his
blood clean, his brain is

259
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,865
flowing, simple stuff.

260
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,299
We don't publicize.

261
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,436
We don't talk about anything
outside of my laboratory.

262
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:55,073
Truth is, and he don't
mind me saying this,

263
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,142
and speaking as
a professional,

264
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,811
he has so much to offer
the world of science

265
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,312
and there's so much
potential for him.

266
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,266
This little light,
this little light

267
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,145
wee-ha!

268
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,079
Yes, sir!

269
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,447
-Yes, sir!
-Hallelujah!

270
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,015
Nice, reverend!

271
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,487
Here on this beautiful
afternoon,

272
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,423
you're about to
experience magic.

273
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:21,059
Yes, I tell you,
beautiful, magic.

274
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:25,630
You are gonna watch this
wheelchair levitate in the air.

275
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:26,898
Oh, yeah!

276
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:26,898
Levitate!

277
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,568
But to make this trick
successful, I need a dollar.

278
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,303
Yes, I ain't say
thirty-five cents and no,

279
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,872
I didn't say no
fifty-five cents.

280
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:34,606
I need a dollar.

281
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:34,606
Going once.

282
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,941
And you, the
beautiful in the pink.

283
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:37,508
Thank you so very much.

284
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:37,508
Anyone else?

285
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:37,508
You got one more
dollar, brother.

286
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,312
Give me that last one.
This is the one.

287
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,547
Let's go, let's
go, let's go!

288
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:42,547
Anybody else?

289
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,016
You're gonna
watch some magic.

290
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,351
I promise you that.

291
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,553
Criss angel ain't got
nothing on this trick.

292
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,021
Now, here we go!

293
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,156
Everyone, are you ready?

294
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,926
The best act out
of the west bank.

295
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,961
My main man, a
hundred grand.

296
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,964
Here he is y'all!

297
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,534
That's my boy!

298
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,370
That's my boy!

299
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,610
He's settling in.

300
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:15,113
It's a part of
the meditation.

301
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,649
Let the magic man do
what the magic man do.

302
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,552
Pictures ain't free.

303
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:24,923
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
it is about to go down.

304
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,092
Oh, yes!

305
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,394
What'd I tell you!

306
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:30,995
Do not try this at home.

307
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,063
I need a dollar.
I need a dollar.

308
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,598
Anybody else?
Come on, come on.

309
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,033
That's what I'm
talking about.

310
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,307
Come on! You see,
that's magic.

311
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,142
Give it up for him y'all!

312
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,003
Melvin!

313
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,373
The kitchen furniture
moves you're doing,

314
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,141
please can you put it back?

315
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,676
Yeah, mom, I'm playing
the piano here.

316
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:22,313
Please put the table and
chairs back where they belong.

317
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,284
You know I don't love
you touching my stuff.

318
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,320
Coming.

319
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,263
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

320
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,032
And the lamp.

321
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,738
What is up with you, love?

322
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,107
Hey, Melvin?

323
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,142
My curling iron,
it's shorted.

324
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,677
So? Is that my problem?

325
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,612
Um, yeah, actually
it is your problem.

326
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:54,612
It's you're fucking fault.

327
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,148
-You, language.
-What are you talking about?

328
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,449
Okay, do you see my hair?

329
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,318
Do you want me to go see
Ryan like this? Really?

330
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,154
No, Ryan or not, you do
not curse in this house.

331
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,155
Okay. Well, you know what?

332
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,323
Thanks a lot, Melvin.

333
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,357
You're a dick.

334
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,759
Can't wait to meet, Ryan.

335
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,361
-Fuck off.
-He sounds lovely.

336
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:12,630
Are you feeling okay?

337
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:13,798
Sure, mom.

338
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,533
Never better.

339
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:32,483
I've been living here
about thirty-five years.

340
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:37,055
I seen all kinda changes, but
nothing to compare to Katrina.

341
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:37,055
Mm-mmm.

342
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:41,325
She just came along and
blew everything away.

343
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:45,696
We gets all kinda hurricanes
around these parts.

344
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:48,733
But we ain't never seen
nothing like her before.

345
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,435
Mm-mmm.

346
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,404
Man, the lord was angry.

347
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,074
People was floating
along the streets.

348
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,708
Dogs!

349
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,111
Families standing
on rooftops

350
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,580
crying cause they ain't
gots no home no more.

351
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:07,418
My old man, he a booze hound,
he been on the ward for years.

352
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,522
And my boy, Deon,
he in the pen.

353
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,791
So me?

354
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,793
I gots no one to help me.

355
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:20,631
So I sank to my knees and
i asked the lord to help me.

356
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,267
The lord come.

357
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,369
Melvin.

358
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,272
Melvin, that's what!

359
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:32,243
He showed up when the
storm was raging and I was

360
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:38,382
cowering in my kitchen like a
kicked dog, roof clean gone.

361
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:41,219
And he led me
out to safety.

362
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:49,727
Storm passed, sun came
out, wind died down.

363
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:54,265
I come home,
my roof is on.

364
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,834
How...

365
00:18:56,836 --> 00:19:00,204
How you gonna explain
shit like that?

366
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:58,930
The brown current ran swiftly
out of the heart of darkness.

367
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:01,599
And kurtz's life was
running swiftly, too.

368
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:07,405
And kurtz's life was
running swiftly, too.

369
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,340
Genius.

370
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,611
As Conrad got older,
he wrote less.

371
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,780
He eventually
settled in england.

372
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:20,518
Didn't care much for public
scrutiny or adoration.

373
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,888
Guess he just wanted to be out
in the country by himself.

374
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:29,827
Like Conrad, mom was a
reclusive writer as well.

375
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,729
Listen to this.

376
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,969
The day broke
gray and dull.

377
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:37,969
God!

378
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:41,772
I mean, I wish I could come
up with shit like that.

379
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,843
Instead, I look out the
window and I think, oh, fuck!

380
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,445
It's raining.

381
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,015
Here, there's something
else I wanna read you.

382
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,584
Fuck off.

383
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,390
One day, I was like
i guess maybe uh,

384
00:20:59,392 --> 00:20:59,390
it was right
before Katrina.

385
00:20:59,392 --> 00:20:59,390
Actually, it was a little
ways before Katrina.

386
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:04,695
This fucking family shows up
in the neighborhood, right?

387
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,665
And it's fucking Mel and
his mom and his fucking

388
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,034
smoking hot sister.

389
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,336
And this black guy
in a wheelchair,

390
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,338
named fucking Lucille.

391
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,041
And fucking Mel, he does
this weird ass trick,

392
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,610
right, where he likes stacks
up these quarters, okay?

393
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,612
And it's like just sitting
there still and all of a

394
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,681
sudden he starts doing
this shit and the quarters

395
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:24,982
start lifting up, right?

396
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,817
And they start separating.

397
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:29,654
And I was like, looking
at Lyle, we're both like,

398
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:30,921
what the fuck, man?

399
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,391
Now, we're just like
fucking boys, I mean.

400
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:36,894
Lucille, Mel, Lucas, Lyle,
me, we're like family.

401
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,995
You know what I mean?

402
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:38,929
How much you got, Lyle?

403
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:38,929
Eighty dollars.

404
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:41,632
Shit, get as much
as you can get.

405
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,700
Think I got
enough for that--

406
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:43,668
-quarter.
-Quarter?

407
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,769
Alright, man.

408
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,937
See if they'll
roll one up for me.

409
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,640
I don't like rolling
mother fucker.

410
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,743
These niggas ain't got
nothing better to do.

411
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,613
You don't know
how to roll.

412
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:55,613
Yo, what's up, Nate?

413
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:57,682
You got some
weed for me, bro?

414
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:57,682
You know it.

415
00:21:57,684 --> 00:22:00,951
Hey, holla at my man,
ramone, right there.

416
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,821
What's going on, bro?

417
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,656
If it ain't
black-man and Robin.

418
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,058
What's happening?

419
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,896
Sup, cuz?
Cat got your tongue?

420
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:13,664
We ain't related, nigga.

421
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,533
And don't be
calling your cuz.

422
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:18,602
We might be related considering
i banged your momma.

423
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:21,105
Big baller,
shot caller, huh?

424
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:22,707
Hey, man, come on. Get
that little crippled

425
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,942
mother fucker up out of
here talking that shit.

426
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,546
You got it, dude.

427
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:31,549
Well, get it the fuck up
out of here then, dude.

428
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,818
Okay, man.

429
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,753
This c-block, cuz.

430
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,688
Nate, man, i
appreciate it brother.

431
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,090
No doubt.

432
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:41,559
I hate having to kiss that
mother fucker, Nathan's,

433
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:43,761
ass just for a
couple joints.

434
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,798
Ah, damn, man.

435
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:49,066
Hey, who got shot?

436
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:52,570
Remember that kid who used
to be dribbling around
with that basketball.

437
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:52,570
Yeah.

438
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:55,039
Got wasted off a
crack rock, Luc.

439
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,640
Dealed from that
mother fucker, Nathan.

440
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,008
Shit, if I wasn't in this
mother fucking chair,

441
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,478
I'd beat all the black
off that mother fucker.

442
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,413
He'd be a Caucasian in
about five minutes.

443
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,448
I'll tell you that
right now, shit.

444
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,108
Feel that?

445
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,108
Yeah.

446
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,412
I can make you come
with my finger.

447
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,814
Imagine what I could
do with my tongue.

448
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:37,715
Hunny?

449
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:39,884
Fuck off.

450
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:41,051
What?

451
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,121
Jesus, you're
a train wreck.

452
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,063
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

453
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:56,500
You mind giving the man
in the chair a shot?

454
00:23:56,502 --> 00:24:00,171
I am so sorry, honey,
but I have a man.

455
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,006
What rap they get
you on, kid?

456
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,979
I'm talking to you.

457
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:16,280
What'd you do?

458
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:19,550
Why'd you get
community service?

459
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:26,824
I set my school on fire.

460
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:30,528
Smoke weed?

461
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,103
If life gets you down,

462
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:41,205
it's not a bad
thing to try.

463
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,640
Always helped me.

464
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,716
Here.

465
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:18,876
Sunny, Florida.

466
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:20,811
Rex is still a baby there.

467
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,680
He won't even
remember that one.

468
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:24,815
First day at school.

469
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:28,319
Notice, how the mother
isn't featured.

470
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:32,590
My old man he split when
uh, when I was just a kid.

471
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:34,224
I'm not about to let
that happen to Rex.

472
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,959
Fuck you.

473
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,943
Care for a mint?

474
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,379
Give me that
mother fucker.

475
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:05,916
You look a little
peaky, Mel.

476
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:07,785
No, I'm just tired, dude.

477
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:09,820
Really?

478
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:10,921
Oh, here we go.

479
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:12,322
You're trying to
scare me now, huh?

480
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:12,322
I'm just saying is all.

481
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:14,925
You look like you
could use rest.

482
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,393
Right, but I'm charting
okay though, right?

483
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,462
It's not what they're saying,
it's what I'm saying.

484
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,701
You know, one day, it
won't hurt if you saw

485
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:25,803
professional help cause i
really don't have a clue

486
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:26,870
what I'm looking for.

487
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:27,871
No doctors, buddy.

488
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:27,871
You know that.

489
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:31,475
Yeah, they're people out there
that know a lot more than me.

490
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,744
I'm a science teacher
in a local college.

491
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:35,479
Doesn't make me any
great authority.

492
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:40,984
God handing out
all the gifts.

493
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:44,221
I'm stuck in
this damn chair.

494
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,923
Yeah, but you got me.

495
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,927
That ain't no damn
consolation prize.

496
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,130
So, we done here or what?

497
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:53,964
Yeah.

498
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,299
-Sweet.
-Lucas.

499
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,235
Let me get a couple of
those pills you gave me

500
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,436
last time for the pain.

501
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:00,471
No, lu.

502
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:02,172
-Mel.
-Hey, hey.

503
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:03,807
Hey, you.

504
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,477
Lucas, you got two of
these. Can I have one?

505
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:09,346
Give a nigga a lab coat
and he think he a doctor.

506
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:09,346
He's getting pissed.

507
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:11,215
-Alright.
-You ain't gonna get your--

508
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:11,215
thank you, doc.

509
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,283
Take care of
yourself, okay?

510
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:14,818
Yeah, I'm good, man.

511
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,153
Chill.

512
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,493
Ten across with the
a in the middle.

513
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,768
Annihilation.

514
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,238
Mother fucker.

515
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,973
How you know that shit?

516
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:37,407
Oh, just a guess.

517
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:39,476
What's next?

518
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:42,246
Alright, seven down when
the same a in the middle.

519
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,251
Anomaly.

520
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:49,086
-Anoma, what?
-Anomaly!

521
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:51,855
It's like a
one-off, like me.

522
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:52,856
Man, you ain't no one-off.

523
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:54,124
You a circus freak.

524
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:58,061
That's funny
coming from you.

525
00:29:58,063 --> 00:29:59,329
Yeah, I got put here.

526
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:01,131
Yeah, you think I chose?

527
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,401
Man, you ain't got
nothing but choices.

528
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:07,304
All you choose to do is
smoke weed and chase cat.

529
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,041
Whoa!

530
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,209
Jimmy!

531
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,912
What up, Jimmy?

532
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,283
Hey, what it look like?

533
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:20,284
You get a haircut?

534
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:24,054
Look at him. Cleaner than
the board of health.

535
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,159
Butch. Sundance.

536
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,527
We ain't doing
that, Jimmy.

537
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,095
We just chilling.

538
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,564
Mm-hmm.

539
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,067
Come on, Melvin.
Put it out.

540
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,936
Show a little respect
for Christ's sakes.

541
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:39,603
It's a joint, man.

542
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:41,905
-I mean--
-i see that.

543
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,273
Here, man.

544
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,308
Thank you, Lucille.

545
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,944
Not a problem.

546
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:49,346
You know what kills me?

547
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,248
Smoking?

548
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,850
No.

549
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:55,152
What kills me is that
you're out here every day

550
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:56,353
doing the same thing.

551
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,622
Getting high, drinking
beers like there's no

552
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:00,357
tomorrow with cool
runnings over here.

553
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:02,626
That shit ain't funny.

554
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:02,626
That was funny.

555
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:02,626
That shit ain't funny.

556
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:02,626
When what you could
be doing is taking

557
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:08,398
responsibility amongst
your community.

558
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,369
I've seen the things
you can do, Melvin.

559
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:13,370
It's no secret
around here.

560
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,472
You got a gift.

561
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,608
But you're wasting it.

562
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,010
You ever thought
about helping out?

563
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:20,010
You know?

564
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:24,948
Hell, maybe create a nicer
environment for your son

565
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,550
to grow up in.

566
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,886
There's something
to think about.

567
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:29,586
What is this?

568
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:29,586
Huh?

569
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:32,389
National pick on
Melvin day, Jimmy?

570
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:35,893
No, it's national get your
shit together day and I

571
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:38,528
say that because I care.

572
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,364
Tell that mother fucker
again cause son of a bitch

573
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:40,364
don't listen to me.

574
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:43,934
And don't be calling
me cool runnings.

575
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,637
I'm on it, Jimmy,
alright? I'm on it.

576
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:48,672
Yeah, on what?

577
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:51,208
Since Amelia?

578
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,444
I'm gonna work
on it, okay?

579
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:55,445
You got my word. I...

580
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:56,446
Give me some time, alright?

581
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:57,581
I'll get my
shit together.

582
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:03,320
Oxycodone.

583
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,689
Semi-synthetic, slow
release painkiller first

584
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:07,991
synthesized by eminent
pharmacologists,

585
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:12,296
freund and speyer,
in Germany in 1916.

586
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:12,296
I'm a fan.

587
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:12,296
Now, I'm gonna show you
some crimes scenes.

588
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:17,301
Third story up, I knew these
guys were robbing the place.

589
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:19,236
Their car was sitting
here, engine running.

590
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:22,439
These two knuckleheads jump
down, they jam into their car.

591
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:22,439
They spot me.

592
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,942
One guy comes
at me, crack!

593
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:24,942
I put him over the head.

594
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:29,446
Next guy, starts waving
some screwdriver at me.

595
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,347
Relieved him of that.

596
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,215
Put him down.
Done.

597
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:35,152
All units, we got a 211 in
progress on Atlantic boulevard.

598
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:41,458
Get them, Lyle.

599
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,260
Come on, man.
Let's move!

600
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,663
The old Vicodin.

601
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:50,000
Heavy, opiate narcotic
to treat severe pain.

602
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:52,102
It's the most widely
prescribed prescription

603
00:32:52,104 --> 00:32:53,737
medication in
this country.

604
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:59,042
Over 140 million prescriptions
of this drug alone.

605
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:01,611
And I'm proud to say that
I'm not one of those people.

606
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:02,479
Why?

607
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,981
Because I steal mine.

608
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:08,151
Woo!

609
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,419
Come on, Lyle!

610
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:14,324
I chase down the guys the cops
don't have time to deal with.

611
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,327
Junkies, small
time criminals.

612
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,695
You gotta be careful.

613
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:21,465
A desperate man can
be a dangerous man.

614
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:23,166
These guys?

615
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,469
Fucking amateurs.

616
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:39,216
Fucking robbed the store for
sixty some odd dollars.

617
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:40,550
What is wrong
with these people?

618
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,619
Yeah, they're crooks,
but they have a bit of

619
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,321
initiative
they're showing.

620
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:44,321
And I like that, because
they're not just sitting

621
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:47,724
around waiting for a
fucking handout, you know?

622
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,326
That's the problem
with the country.

623
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:51,628
You gotta bunch of lazy
mother fuckers sitting on

624
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,097
their fat asses with a
begging bowl in one hand

625
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:55,465
and McDonald's
in the other.

626
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:58,235
Yeah, they're criminals,
but atleast they're trying.

627
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,480
Woo-hoo!

628
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:11,581
Yee-ha!

629
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:13,683
What?

630
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:18,455
I was ready to love the
whole fucking world.

631
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:19,456
Rawr!

632
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:20,824
But no one understood me!

633
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:21,825
Nobody!

634
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:24,261
So I learned to hate.

635
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:25,796
You think I'm the one
to set things straight?

636
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:26,797
Look at me, man.

637
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,532
Wrong.

638
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,270
Ah, fuck.

639
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:34,438
No, no, no.

640
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,474
Talented and
astute, but lazy.

641
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:42,846
Likely to understand everything
and even accomplish something.

642
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:49,286
He had nonetheless been content
to enjoy life as a spectator.

643
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:54,091
Maupassant, i
dig you, man.

644
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:55,859
I dig you!

645
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,708
Get off!

646
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,522
Oh my god!

647
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,823
Mom, look.

648
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,292
Oh my god!

649
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:36,860
Oh my god!

650
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,528
What happened?

651
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,462
You okay?

652
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:41,531
I was out, or what?

653
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,335
Yeah, you were out.

654
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:46,736
Let me go get somebody.

655
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,907
Hey, man.

656
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,242
Hey, mom.

657
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:53,977
How you doing?

658
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:56,346
You're gonna be okay.

659
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,550
What happened?

660
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,785
Ah, let me see.

661
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,387
Melvin was being Melvin.

662
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,690
Melvin can do anything.

663
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:08,692
Melvin think he can fly.

664
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:11,761
Melvin think he can drink
a whole liquor store.

665
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,964
Melvin jump off cliff.

666
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:16,233
Hurt when hit ground.

667
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,436
That's pretty much
what happened, man.

668
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:19,936
-Hi.
-How you doing?

669
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,771
Hi, how are you feeling?

670
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,373
You just woke up?

671
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:23,373
Yeah, what is this thing?

672
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:25,875
This just checks
your heart rate.

673
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:28,411
You went into cardiac
arrest so we're just

674
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:29,746
monitoring you right now.

675
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,281
You gonna be
his nurse today?

676
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:31,281
Yes, sir.

677
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:32,949
Can you by my
nurse tomorrow?

678
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:33,683
Sure.

679
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:33,683
Alright.

680
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:33,683
That's what I'm
talking about.

681
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:42,325
I got a little pain down
below and you know,

682
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:42,325
he's been dead for a while.

683
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:45,829
I was wondering if you could
bring him back to life,

684
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:47,931
you know, a little
mouth to mouth

685
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:50,433
resuscitation would
help me right now.

686
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,434
Stop, don't
listen to that.

687
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,602
We apologize for him.

688
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:52,602
That's okay.

689
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:52,602
We get that all the time.

690
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:56,473
I was just having
fun with you, girl.

691
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:58,575
Just being serious.

692
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:08,551
Sir, is your full
name Melvin hesper?

693
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:11,755
That's me doc,
but call me Mel.

694
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:15,458
We cannot seem to find any
medical records on you.

695
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,827
Any type of history?

696
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,629
I never go to
the hospitals.

697
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,864
Never?

698
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:24,000
Never broke a bone,
a bad flu, anything?

699
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,870
What about medical
insurance?

700
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:26,870
Are you covered?

701
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:31,608
Why would I be covered if
i don't go to a hospital?

702
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,545
These scars, they look
like gunshot wounds.

703
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:37,447
What can you tell
me about them?

704
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:38,848
They're gunshot wounds.

705
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,050
That's very funny.

706
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:41,851
How did you get them?

707
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,654
A gun.

708
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,058
Tell me about this one.

709
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,627
Oh, this?
It's nothing.

710
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:53,663
Just some cap stuck
me a few years back.

711
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,465
You didn't get
medical help?

712
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:59,502
I don't have
insurance, doc.

713
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:04,874
Sir, you just suffered a
serious cardiac arrest.

714
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:08,945
Your heart stopped beating
for several minutes.

715
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:10,880
You were certified dead.

716
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,418
Look, we're gonna need to
keep you under observation

717
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,454
for atleast
forty-eight hours.

718
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:20,724
Our preliminary tests
produced some particularly

719
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:24,728
interesting results that
may be personal to you.

720
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:51,654
Lying there in the hospital,
i realized something.

721
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:53,590
I got it all wrong.

722
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:55,725
I've been a total asshole.

723
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,896
You on some kind of
narcotic, nigger?

724
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,899
No, I'm being serious.

725
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,067
I got a gift here, man.

726
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,569
I gotta start using it.

727
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,638
Use it for the good.

728
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,507
I'm gonna change.

729
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:13,009
I'm gonna start fighting
crime, not committing it.

730
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,577
I've been saying
that shit for years.

731
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,980
Yeah, I know. Well, I wasn't
ready to listen, okay?

732
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:19,082
But lying there with my
whole life flashing in

733
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:22,051
front of me,
it came to me.

734
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:26,189
I'm gonna do whatever
it takes for Rex.

735
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:27,891
No more drinking.

736
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:29,959
No more weed, pills.

737
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:32,061
I'm even gonna
stop cigarettes.

738
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:35,865
Pussy, cheating,
hustling, stealing.

739
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:37,667
I'm even thinking about
stopping jerking off.

740
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:38,802
Yeah, I wouldn't
go that far.

741
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:40,937
No--

742
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:41,905
maybe that's a
bit too much.

743
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:44,507
Yeah, that's too much. Shit.

744
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:49,546
From this day forward, I'm
going straight, brother.

745
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:50,613
I am.

746
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,217
Well, alright.

747
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:57,554
I'll tell you what,
I'm with you, Melvin.

748
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,759
Melvin, this is
your calling.

749
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:04,694
What you got is a gift.

750
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,696
It's from the heavens.

751
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:08,698
So is Rex, brother.

752
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,166
So is Rex.

753
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:33,957
Fuck.

754
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,065
It's okay.

755
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:02,118
He got the plan
inside his hand.

756
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,721
Understand that
he's the man.

757
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:06,956
Each and every time
abide the sign.

758
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,825
Press the rewind
in your own mind.

759
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:08,825
Kick it one more time.

760
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:13,062
Hey, Mel. Can you bend
his mouth to shut up?

761
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,666
Uh!

762
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,607
See he got the master
plan inside his hand.

763
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:26,676
Understand that he's
the man, got the plan.

764
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:28,177
Surprise.

765
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,048
You gotta be kidding me.

766
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,149
Drink it.

767
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:34,684
It's robiatic.

768
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:36,853
It's what?

769
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:38,621
Healthy.

770
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:39,989
You mean macrobiotic.

771
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:40,790
Whatever, man.

772
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:41,858
Just drink the shit.

773
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,992
It's good for you.

774
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,065
I can't drink
this shit man.

775
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,801
I'll start voting green
peace and dating guys.

776
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:55,605
Alright.

777
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:57,307
It's good.

778
00:42:57,309 --> 00:43:00,276
You know, I read this
book about health.

779
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:02,111
I put some
celery in there.

780
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:05,648
They said to clean out the
lungs, you know, reduces mucus.

781
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,216
And you'll spit all that
tarred-nicotine from them

782
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:07,216
cigarettes out.

783
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:10,620
And then I put some ginger
in there that'll clean out

784
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:10,620
the blood stream.

785
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:14,657
Help get all that alcohol
and whatever else you been

786
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:16,125
putting up your damn nose.

787
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:18,828
And uh, you
gonna piss a lot.

788
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,196
-Just understand that.
-Mm-hmm.

789
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:21,664
But that's a good thing.

790
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,132
I taste the ginger.

791
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:24,934
Yeah, it got a
little heat on it.

792
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,036
I put some rhubarb
in there, too.

793
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:27,837
Rhubarb?

794
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,172
Rhubarb.

795
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:30,607
-Yeah.
-What the hell is rhubarb?

796
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:31,641
It clears the mind.

797
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:31,641
It's a root.

798
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:31,641
Oh, I know.
Yeah, yeah.

799
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:35,278
I ain't put no voodoo
or nothing on this.

800
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,679
It's just to
clean you out.

801
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:37,347
Yeah!

802
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:38,781
One more, one more.

803
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,718
Come on, champ.

804
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,187
I care about you, brother.

805
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:46,189
I wanna see
you get better.

806
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:47,957
I wanna see you do better.

807
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,127
Thanks, buddy.

808
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:56,265
We was fourteen?

809
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:58,067
We was twelve actually.

810
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:59,836
Yeah, just about
to turn thirteen.

811
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:01,037
We met in uh, California.

812
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,842
I hadn't seen my boy
for some years and

813
00:44:05,844 --> 00:44:08,878
then I come back, and he's
able to do all this stuff

814
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,114
like, you know, make
spoons move across the

815
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:12,882
table and shit like that.

816
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:14,050
You know.

817
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:15,218
Black people don't
usually, you know, get

818
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,086
along with that kinda
stuff, you know.

819
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:18,354
That's why you don't see
a lot of black people at

820
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:18,354
magician shows, you know.

821
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:21,824
Cause they think it's like
voodoo and the devil.

822
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,900
Yeah, I remember I called you
and I was like, where's Lucille?

823
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:35,238
And I asked your mom, and
she said, Melvin, he's gone.

824
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,172
He's in the military.

825
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,373
I said, what?
What the fuck?

826
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,809
Slap him.
Slap him.

827
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:41,110
Two peas and a biscuit.

828
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:42,211
Two peas and a biscuit.

829
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,284
Hit that mother fucker.

830
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:48,284
Drop the bitch.

831
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:55,024
I left dodging bullets and
ending up dodging more bullets.

832
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,993
And one of them got me.

833
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:13,209
You have no idea what's
in that box of yours

834
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:14,477
do you, mother fucker?

835
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:15,378
That's what I'm
talking about.

836
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,412
Muscle memory.

837
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:16,412
Like riding a bike.

838
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:20,349
You don't know what your made
of til you test that heart.

839
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:21,718
Go on, put it to the test.

840
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,187
What he can do around
these neighborhoods,

841
00:45:24,189 --> 00:45:27,323
around the world, around the
country with that gift,

842
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:29,792
could fix a whole
lot of shit.

843
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:39,302
What the fuck!

844
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:39,302
Sorry!

845
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:41,304
What the hell
just happened?

846
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:41,304
Hey, pipe down.

847
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:44,807
We're training over
here, mother fucker.

848
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:44,807
Fuck.

849
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:47,443
I knew he was
paralyzed, you know.

850
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:47,443
I mean, he told me that.

851
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:50,246
And you know, I didn't
quite know how I was gonna

852
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,248
handle it, but my main
thing was I was gonna

853
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,117
treat him as i
always treated him.

854
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:57,153
As my equal, as my friend,
and as my brother.

855
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:01,424
Fuck.

856
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:04,861
Lucille, this is some
heavy shit, man.

857
00:46:04,863 --> 00:46:04,861
Five more.

858
00:46:04,863 --> 00:46:08,097
-It's that green juice, man.
-Ah, it's something else.

859
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:08,097
That shit taste nasty,
but it's doing something.

860
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:08,097
It's something else, man.
It's something else.

861
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,001
It's running
through my blood.

862
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:13,369
It's a new energy.

863
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:14,437
I don't know what it is.

864
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:15,872
It's scary, man.

865
00:46:15,874 --> 00:46:16,939
Don't be scared of it.

866
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,374
Let it flow.

867
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,060
You doing this
shit again, ain't you?

868
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,930
See? He can do
anything, man.

869
00:46:40,932 --> 00:46:40,930
Anything.

870
00:46:40,932 --> 00:46:42,999
That's what I'm
talking about, Melvin.

871
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:45,101
You getting back
to yourself.

872
00:46:45,103 --> 00:46:48,070
Look like you did when you
was in your twenties, huh?

873
00:46:48,072 --> 00:46:49,806
That's right.

874
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:53,843
Stop showing off,
mother fucker.

875
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,518
Are you sure this
is the block, or?

876
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,221
Yeah, man. She come
this way all the time.

877
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,491
Wait til you see her.

878
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,926
Mm!

879
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,433
What?

880
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:18,234
I'm just looking at you.

881
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:20,102
Is that a problem?

882
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:21,838
You looking at me like
you don't believe me.

883
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,439
Of course I believe you.

884
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:28,044
You said you see her every
day, she's obviously late.

885
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:29,612
Just give it a
little time, man.

886
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:31,347
Give it a little time.

887
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,082
Something that fine
need a little time.

888
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:35,184
It's like wine.

889
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:39,288
You know, we could just
come back another day, too.

890
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,357
It's no big deal.

891
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,464
Damn.

892
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:52,235
I really thought I had a
shot with this one, man.

893
00:47:52,237 --> 00:47:54,437
You may, Luc.
Come on.

894
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:55,238
Maybe she's sick.

895
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,906
She's at home. She...

896
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:56,906
You'll find her.

897
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,975
Eh, man, fuck it,
man. Come on.

898
00:47:58,977 --> 00:48:00,042
-Let's go.
-Really?

899
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:00,977
-Yeah, man. Fuck it.
-You done?

900
00:48:00,979 --> 00:48:01,944
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

901
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:03,446
-What?
-There she is.

902
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:04,447
Oh, fuck.

903
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:05,948
Which one is she?

904
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,450
The one that don't look
like a water buffalo.

905
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:09,252
Stop laughing, man.

906
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:09,252
They looking.
They looking.

907
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:11,520
Yup.

908
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:12,922
Chill. Chill.

909
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:14,357
Hey, ladies,
what's cracking?

910
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:16,058
What you doing?

911
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,393
Just chilling, baby.

912
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,562
What's your
name, baby girl?

913
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:20,463
Yolanda.

914
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:22,198
Yolanda.

915
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,299
I like that.

916
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:23,299
Thank you.

917
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:25,568
Tell you what, yolanda.

918
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:29,005
If I could impress you, would
you let me call you one time?

919
00:48:30,642 --> 00:48:32,341
You gonna impress me?

920
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,244
Knock yourself out.

921
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:43,686
Uh-huh.

922
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,523
How the hell you do that?

923
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:50,960
Walking is the only
thing I can't do, baby.

924
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:52,395
You feel me?

925
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,197
It's uh, 717...

926
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:56,332
I'm listening.

927
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:57,400
21...

928
00:48:57,402 --> 00:48:58,167
Uh-huh.

929
00:48:58,169 --> 00:48:59,168
82.

930
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,203
That's what I'm
talking about.

931
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:03,439
Bye.

932
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:05,541
I just love
watching you walk.

933
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:05,541
Stop.

934
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:08,210
You look good
coming and going.

935
00:49:08,212 --> 00:49:09,345
Thank you.

936
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:10,446
Mm!

937
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:12,348
Did you get the
number, man?

938
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,586
I knew your ass was good for
something, mother fucker.

939
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:19,121
She is beautiful, Luc.

940
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:20,556
I wasn't bullshitting, was it?

941
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:20,556
Hell no.
She's fine.

942
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:24,493
Man, I'll tell you, I'll wait
out here fifteen hours for that.

943
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:25,695
Shit, she just
looked back.

944
00:49:25,697 --> 00:49:26,595
Don't look.
Don't look.

945
00:49:26,597 --> 00:49:28,230
-Alright.
-Just be cool.

946
00:49:28,232 --> 00:49:30,099
We should just
peel out of here.

947
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:32,034
Yeah, she's looking
all the way.

948
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:33,502
Don't look anxious, right?

949
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:34,737
No, no, no. We gonna
go the opposite way.

950
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:34,737
We can't be, you know...

951
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:37,239
Alright, I'm in
there then, shit.

952
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:38,174
-You see that ass?
-Like donkey Kong.

953
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:40,009
Like a mother fucker.

954
00:49:40,011 --> 00:49:41,544
Shit, i'ma put her
ass in a wheelchair.

955
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:45,081
Shit.

956
00:49:48,052 --> 00:49:49,418
Two years? Jesus.

957
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:52,722
-Hey.
-Yo!

958
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:52,722
Where's the man?

959
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:52,722
-Where's Danny?
-Yo, he's inside.

960
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:56,359
Let me go get
him, brother.

961
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:57,693
-Danny.
-Yeah?

962
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,062
The boys are here.

963
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:01,464
Oh, shit.

964
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:03,566
Danny boy!

965
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:06,135
-Mother fuckers.
-Look at this guy.

966
00:50:07,038 --> 00:50:10,006
-Welcome home, man.
-Good to see you, brother.

967
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:11,173
-Come here, man.
-What's up, brother?

968
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:12,641
God damn.

969
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:14,210
Ain't nobody tamper
with you, did they?

970
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:15,411
No, no, no.

971
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:15,411
Shit.

972
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:18,714
-Mel?
-I'm good. Taking the night off.

973
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:20,349
Ah, don't be a pussy,
man. Let's drink.

974
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:21,650
Yeah, man. He just
got out of the joint.

975
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,285
Hey, the mother
fucker's in training.

976
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:25,454
Won't you two just
chill the fuck out?

977
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,025
Just trying to
make some changes.

978
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:30,292
What? It's my first
night back, man.

979
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:32,194
I thought we was
gonna roll all night.

980
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:34,163
We are, man.
I'm hanging!

981
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:34,163
You're hanging.

982
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:37,299
What the fuck you talking
about, hanging, man?

983
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:37,299
I've been away two years.

984
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:41,037
You're gonna hang
my first night back?

985
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:45,408
Man, the brother is getting
his life together for Rex.

986
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:48,677
No, shit.

987
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:49,745
Yeah, man.

988
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,420
You doing it for your boy?

989
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:58,487
I am.

990
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:00,189
Good on you then, brother.

991
00:51:00,191 --> 00:51:02,124
I'm proud of you.

992
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:03,259
You're a good man, Mel.

993
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:03,259
Yeah.

994
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:06,162
I, however, am not
a fucking good man.

995
00:51:06,164 --> 00:51:08,764
And if I wake
up alive tomorrow,

996
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:10,699
I'm gonna consider this night
a mother fucking waste.

997
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:10,699
Hey, hey, hey.

998
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:13,702
I probably won't remember
none of this shit anyway.

999
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,337
He never remembers shit.

1000
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:16,338
Don't take too long, guys.

1001
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,573
-Come on up.
-I gotta try, man.

1002
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:18,707
That's all.

1003
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:18,707
I gotta try.

1004
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:21,477
It's fucking good
to see you, brother.

1005
00:51:21,479 --> 00:51:22,478
You too.

1006
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,679
Good to see you, too, Luc.

1007
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:23,679
Hell yeah, that's good.

1008
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:26,549
Let's get to seeing
some ass right here.

1009
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:27,516
You see that right there?

1010
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:28,818
That's what's good to see.

1011
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,852
Time to ride.

1012
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:34,583
Hey, what up, homie?

1013
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:36,352
Hey, holla at your boy.

1014
00:52:36,354 --> 00:52:37,887
That's what's good.

1015
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:37,887
You straight?

1016
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:40,356
You staying
out of trouble?

1017
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,529
Alright, man.

1018
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:48,364
Stay out of trouble, man.

1019
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,345
You know what this is?

1020
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,282
I don't know.
You tell me.

1021
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:07,750
It's sober hand.

1022
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:10,352
Okay.

1023
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:13,789
I'm sober.

1024
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:17,560
When I was in the hospital,
i did a lot of thinking.

1025
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:19,461
All the things
you were saying.

1026
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:23,332
Lucille's been
telling me for years.

1027
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:24,500
And I'm ready.

1028
00:53:24,502 --> 00:53:27,736
I'm ready to do some
good in this community.

1029
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:30,940
Is that why you show up to
crime scenes and relieve

1030
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:33,442
the suspects of
their stolen goods?

1031
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:33,442
Come on, man.

1032
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:33,442
That was then,
this is now.

1033
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:36,745
I've been through
something.

1034
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:38,247
No fucking around.

1035
00:53:38,249 --> 00:53:39,782
I wanna help you.

1036
00:53:39,784 --> 00:53:41,717
Really?

1037
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,652
Ready to take on
that responsibility?

1038
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,921
Yes.

1039
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:47,590
Tell me what you
want me to do.

1040
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,561
I always knew you'd
be the one, Melvin.

1041
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,496
Your natural abilities,
the shit you can do.

1042
00:53:54,498 --> 00:53:55,431
I've known you for years.

1043
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:56,799
It's still amazing.

1044
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:01,270
Hey, what's up, bitches?

1045
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:14,783
That's the shit I'm dealing
with every god damn day.

1046
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:17,686
You know that mother
fucker peddles rock and

1047
00:54:17,688 --> 00:54:20,856
smack to kids not much
older than your son.

1048
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:22,391
Yeah, I know.

1049
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:26,262
That's why I'm here.

1050
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,397
Thanks, Jimmy.

1051
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:32,268
Thanks for believing
in me, buddy.

1052
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:38,540
Be careful with Nathan.

1053
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:40,576
He's a dangerous
mother fucker, man.

1054
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:47,316
Alright.

1055
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:52,921
-You ready?
-Yeah, I got this.

1056
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:00,429
Melvin.

1057
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:02,364
Shit.

1058
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:02,364
I'm sorry, man.

1059
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:07,069
You are not as ready
as you think you are.

1060
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,416
What the hell
you doing here?

1061
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:22,017
What you want?

1062
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:23,585
Where's Nathan at?

1063
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,088
Man, you know you don't
belong around here

1064
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,423
so take your ass home.

1065
00:55:27,425 --> 00:55:29,491
Get Nathan down here now.

1066
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:32,494
Say what, now?

1067
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,829
So you giving me orders?

1068
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,365
Man, get the fuck out of
here before you get hurt.

1069
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:38,434
I'm not moving.

1070
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:39,968
Maybe this'll help you.

1071
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:40,869
Oh yeah?
Go for it.

1072
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:42,438
Make your move.

1073
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,708
Make your fucking move.

1074
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:53,982
Ooo!

1075
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:55,117
What you got?

1076
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,552
You got a piece
back there?

1077
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:57,720
Bring it.

1078
00:55:57,722 --> 00:55:58,987
Man, how the
fuck you do that?

1079
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,656
You tell Nathan
i wanna see him.

1080
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:03,058
Anytime, anywhere.

1081
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,695
Bunch of fucking
pussies, hurting kids.

1082
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:20,476
This is just a small
way of saying welcome

1083
00:56:20,478 --> 00:56:22,077
to our home, Ryan.

1084
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,913
It's Melvin's
favorite cake.

1085
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:27,750
I'm really thrilled that
he has decided to make

1086
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:28,984
certain positive changes.

1087
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:28,984
Come on, mom. Please?

1088
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:31,787
-Well, I am.
-Mom, that is embarrassing.

1089
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:31,787
Stop.

1090
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:34,723
Thank you so much for
welcoming me into your

1091
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:36,525
lovely home, miss hesper.

1092
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:41,029
Melvin, would you like
to personally greet ry?

1093
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:42,664
Oh, love to.

1094
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:44,933
You hurt my sister, I'm gonna
break your fucking jaw.

1095
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:45,801
Melvin, language.

1096
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:45,801
Oh my god!

1097
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:45,801
Eh, I'm just
kidding you, buddy.

1098
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:50,005
Sorry, Ryan, let me just
apologize for my mentally

1099
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:52,775
handicapped brother
who's a total dick.

1100
00:56:52,777 --> 00:56:52,775
Ryan.

1101
00:56:52,777 --> 00:56:55,911
How hungry are
you feeling?

1102
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:56,979
It certainly
looks delicious.

1103
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:58,180
I'll take a
healthy size piece.

1104
00:56:58,182 --> 00:56:59,548
Thank you very much.

1105
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,817
Well, you do have
lovely manners.

1106
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:04,052
I appreciate a young man
who knows how to say

1107
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:05,988
please and thank you.

1108
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:08,090
And where's your
delightful accent from?

1109
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:10,726
I'm originally from
Oklahoma, miss hesper.

1110
00:57:10,728 --> 00:57:11,994
Well, please
call me Eileen.

1111
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:11,994
-I insist.
-Stop it.

1112
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:16,432
No, me and the kids father,
we went up to Oklahoma once.

1113
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:17,933
-It was--
-what the hell is going on?

1114
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,101
-Seriously, can you stop?
-Melvin.

1115
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,503
And we were in this
like yellow Cadillac.

1116
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:23,906
And it was just
so much fun.

1117
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:25,974
What the fuck!

1118
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:27,209
Ryan, language please.

1119
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:28,977
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-Melvin.

1120
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:30,446
-Stop showing off.
-I have to go.

1121
00:57:30,448 --> 00:57:30,446
Wow, great.

1122
00:57:30,448 --> 00:57:32,581
Thank you.
Thanks, Melvin.

1123
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,716
I swear to god, you
are such a penis!

1124
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:34,716
What?

1125
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:37,186
I thought that
went rather well.

1126
00:57:37,188 --> 00:57:38,020
I liked him.

1127
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:39,721
She liked him.

1128
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:41,523
I'm playing around, mom.

1129
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:41,523
Jesus.

1130
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:41,523
One evening where we could

1131
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:46,595
just sit as a family and have
a nice little piece of cake.

1132
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:48,096
Oh, come on.
I'm just...

1133
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:49,465
Fuck.

1134
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,642
Hey, man. Where the fuck
are you going now?

1135
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:01,977
It's Lucille.

1136
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:03,979
What is he?

1137
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:03,979
I don't know.

1138
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,982
I have no way of
explaining it.

1139
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,488
-Where's 167?
-Right there.

1140
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,231
Look, Mel, man,
you need to leave.

1141
00:58:22,233 --> 00:58:23,565
You can't be
around us, man.

1142
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:24,833
-How is he?
-How is he?

1143
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,668
Nathan walked up and
stuck a bullet in him

1144
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,203
cause of something
you did, man.

1145
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:30,739
Just walked up and shot
the cat outside my place.

1146
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:32,641
I'm sorry, Luc.

1147
00:58:32,643 --> 00:58:33,942
I am so sorry, bro.

1148
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:33,942
Hey, Mel, listen man.

1149
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:37,813
If you're really sorry, the best
thing you can do is leave, bro.

1150
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:38,714
Yeah, just get
the fuck it.

1151
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:40,582
Fuck you, Lyle.

1152
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:40,582
This is between
me and Lucille.

1153
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:44,086
Yeah, but it's not between
you and Lucille anymore, bro.

1154
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:44,086
It's between all of us.

1155
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:47,289
You're the one who brought
us into this thing.

1156
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:48,790
You need to walk away.

1157
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:48,790
He's right.

1158
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:52,728
I mean, you started a
war we can't fight, bro.

1159
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,563
Hey.

1160
00:58:54,565 --> 00:58:55,898
Hey!

1161
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,032
Promise me.

1162
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,601
Mel, look what
you got us into.

1163
00:58:59,603 --> 00:59:01,970
Luc, talk to me.

1164
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:07,075
Let me take
of you, brother.

1165
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,147
Get the fuck out, Melvin.

1166
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:19,588
Alright.

1167
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,392
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

1168
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,473
Melvin.

1169
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:26,808
Hey, Jimmy.

1170
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:28,877
I thought you were
giving up the drink.

1171
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:32,280
Some things
change, I guess.

1172
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:35,383
You want a drink?

1173
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:37,152
No.

1174
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,187
Gotta get going.

1175
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:40,455
Just wanted to say hello.

1176
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:43,225
Alright, Jimmy.

1177
01:02:43,227 --> 01:02:44,826
Take her easy.

1178
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,927
Lucille.

1179
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:55,130
Lucille!

1180
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:00,836
What the fuck you want?

1181
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:02,437
I'm sorry.

1182
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:05,574
Man, keep your
damn voice down.

1183
01:04:05,576 --> 01:04:07,242
I'm sorry.

1184
01:04:07,244 --> 01:04:09,244
You're drunk ain't
you, mother fucker?

1185
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,479
God damn, Melvin.

1186
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:13,915
I'm not talking to your
ass while you're drunk.

1187
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:15,550
Just let me inside.

1188
01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:19,087
Man, get the hell away
from my house, man.

1189
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:22,224
I'm tired of seeing
you like this, bro.

1190
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:27,896
I love you, man.

1191
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,087
Yo!

1192
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:58,126
Hey.

1193
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:00,462
What's up, Mel?

1194
01:05:00,464 --> 01:05:01,596
You look like shit.

1195
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:04,666
What's going on?

1196
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:06,334
Just wanna hang, man.

1197
01:05:06,336 --> 01:05:07,402
Who is it?

1198
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:08,436
It's Melvin.

1199
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:08,436
What does he want?

1200
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:12,507
I don't want that mother fucker,
Nathan, showing up here.

1201
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:16,211
Anybody follow you here?

1202
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:17,979
Yeah, these babies.

1203
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:19,381
How's he look, man?

1204
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:19,381
He's wasted.

1205
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:22,083
Really? Did he
bring any friends?

1206
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,219
Brought a whole fucking
bag full of 'em.

1207
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:27,989
You wanna party, Mel?

1208
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,325
Get your ass up here, man.

1209
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:32,027
What a fucking privilege.

1210
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:38,099
Fucking a. We got our
old Melvin back.

1211
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:38,099
Let's call someone.

1212
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:40,635
Hey, man, we'll
call lots of people.

1213
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:43,371
Oh, shit.

1214
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:47,309
I'm happy to see you, man.

1215
01:05:47,311 --> 01:05:48,510
I'm happy to see
you, too, brother.

1216
01:05:48,512 --> 01:05:50,445
Did they fuck
with you in there?

1217
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:51,513
A little bit, man.

1218
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:52,981
Sexually, no?

1219
01:05:52,983 --> 01:05:53,682
Fuck you, man.

1220
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:54,382
I don't know...

1221
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:58,653
If it wasn't for Lucille, maybe
you'd be one of my best friends.

1222
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:01,589
Fuck being sober!

1223
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:03,124
To being fucking back.

1224
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:11,333
When are the
bitches showing up?

1225
01:06:11,335 --> 01:06:14,135
-Fuck all this bullshit.
-Danny, where you going?

1226
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,603
I'm putting music on.

1227
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:17,439
I gotta pee.

1228
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:12,427
She was fat.

1229
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:12,427
No way. She wasn't fat.

1230
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:17,265
Just cause a chick got big
hips and a big ass doesn't

1231
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:17,265
make her fat.

1232
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:17,265
Now, if she got fat
hips and a fat ass...

1233
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:21,369
No, did you see the size
of those fucking tits?

1234
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,404
Those are motor
boating tits.

1235
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:24,072
Those are good tits.

1236
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:25,173
Good tits for you.

1237
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:25,173
You should did her, man.

1238
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:25,173
It's the reason why
we're running late now.

1239
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:31,146
Fucking liquor store's probably
not even open thanks to you.

1240
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:31,146
Yo, Mel.

1241
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:32,680
Is that you,
mother fucker?

1242
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:36,584
Kiss my ass, Melvin.

1243
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:40,288
Fuck you, man!

1244
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:45,693
I ain't no bitch!

1245
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:51,166
-Holy shit.
-Aye, yo! Let's go!

1246
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:55,403
Are you hit, man?

1247
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,472
-No.
-You alright?

1248
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,641
Guys, we gotta get
the fuck out of here?

1249
01:07:59,643 --> 01:08:01,109
Just take me to Lucas's.

1250
01:08:01,111 --> 01:08:02,577
Dude, what's wrong, bro?

1251
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:03,511
It's my heart.

1252
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:05,080
Just get me there.

1253
01:08:10,353 --> 01:08:11,519
Fuck.

1254
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:18,526
Mel. Mel, this is...

1255
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:18,526
This is crazy.

1256
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:21,663
I don't have a clue
what I'm looking for.

1257
01:08:21,665 --> 01:08:23,498
You really need to
see a specialist.

1258
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,266
I'll be alright.

1259
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:27,402
I just need to rest.

1260
01:08:27,404 --> 01:08:28,770
But you're not alright.

1261
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:30,538
The more you're using your
abilities, the more it's

1262
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:31,840
hurting you.

1263
01:08:31,842 --> 01:08:33,741
Oh, yeah?

1264
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:36,211
Thought you said you
weren't a specialist?

1265
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:40,148
Mel, look, I...

1266
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:43,852
I wanna help, but I'm not
comfortable with this.

1267
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,497
Son of a bitch.

1268
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:58,800
You son of a bitch.

1269
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,717
Son of a bitch.

1270
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,720
Son of a bitch.

1271
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:23,324
You are dumb playing
this game, mother fucker.

1272
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:28,429
Yeah, man.

1273
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:30,765
How's the arm?

1274
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:36,271
I've had worse.

1275
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:39,874
It's good to see you.

1276
01:09:39,876 --> 01:09:42,243
Likewise, man.

1277
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:02,497
I worry about you.

1278
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,833
Come here, ma.

1279
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:14,576
Everything's
gonna be alright.

1280
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:22,837
Impressed?

1281
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:43,524
So?

1282
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:46,761
Brother, you the only
mother fucker I know

1283
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:48,830
that'll turn a Porsche
into a Nissan and still

1284
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:51,032
feel good about himself.

1285
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:54,102
Hey, Jimmy.

1286
01:12:54,104 --> 01:12:55,470
Hey.

1287
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,040
How's Lucille holding up?

1288
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:00,074
He's good.

1289
01:13:00,076 --> 01:13:01,476
He's doing better.

1290
01:13:01,478 --> 01:13:02,477
That's good.

1291
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:04,712
Listen, um...

1292
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,013
Just wanted you to know
it's gonna get noisy at

1293
01:13:06,015 --> 01:13:07,815
c-block later.

1294
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,618
You need me?

1295
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:16,424
When you get the
call, ignore it.

1296
01:13:16,426 --> 01:13:18,159
I got this.

1297
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:22,597
Thanks, Jim.

1298
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:33,174
Chopin, vagner,
Beethoven, Mozart.

1299
01:13:33,176 --> 01:13:35,076
You know what they
all have in common?

1300
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:36,978
They're Europeans, man.

1301
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:39,647
I mean, those cats had so
much history and culture

1302
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:41,115
to draw from
when they wrote.

1303
01:13:41,117 --> 01:13:45,453
That's why their concertos are
still amazing to this day.

1304
01:13:45,455 --> 01:13:48,423
I mean, listen to that.

1305
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:53,094
The changes, the notes,
the way it prociendos.

1306
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:54,429
It's perfect.

1307
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,797
I fucking love it.

1308
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:04,505
We're here.

1309
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:10,144
It's hot as a mother
fucker out here today.

1310
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:13,815
Alright, man.
Let's go.

1311
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:18,019
Oh, shit.

1312
01:14:18,021 --> 01:14:19,487
What the fuck?

1313
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:23,491
Man, what the fuck, man?

1314
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:25,460
Shit, all the
shit's coming out.

1315
01:14:25,462 --> 01:14:27,728
Take it and put
that shit in there.

1316
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,897
Can't have the
feds see this, man.

1317
01:14:29,899 --> 01:14:31,032
Fuck, man.

1318
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:33,134
-Ah!
-Shit!

1319
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:36,671
I know you out here, you
magic mother fucker!

1320
01:14:36,673 --> 01:14:37,238
Come out!

1321
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:39,040
Oh, you fuck...

1322
01:14:39,042 --> 01:14:39,040
Come on, Melvin!

1323
01:14:39,042 --> 01:14:41,876
I know you out there
you magic bitch.

1324
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,012
Fuck!

1325
01:14:56,259 --> 01:14:57,625
What the fuck, man!

1326
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:14,909
Fuck you!

1327
01:15:14,911 --> 01:15:16,677
Fuck you!

1328
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,980
I'm coming for
you, you bitch!

1329
01:15:18,982 --> 01:15:20,114
You gonna fuck with me.

1330
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:27,088
Alright, your
boys are running now!

1331
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:28,189
Kiss my ass, Melvin.

1332
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:28,956
Come on!

1333
01:15:30,226 --> 01:15:31,259
Damn.

1334
01:15:31,261 --> 01:15:32,660
Fuck!

1335
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:37,798
Yeah, I like
seeing you run.

1336
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,966
Fuck you, man.

1337
01:15:38,968 --> 01:15:40,201
Yeah!

1338
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:42,770
Crazy motherfucker!

1339
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:44,238
Done, motherfucker.

1340
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,744
This is gonna be fun.

1341
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,915
Hide and seek time,
mother fucker.

1342
01:15:53,917 --> 01:15:57,752
I remember playing this
when I was a kid.

1343
01:15:58,688 --> 01:15:59,754
I love seeing you run.

1344
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:09,096
Here I come!

1345
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:22,743
I heard something happened
to that mother fucker Nathan.

1346
01:16:23,713 --> 01:16:25,780
I think he got the message.

1347
01:16:25,782 --> 01:16:27,615
I got somewhere
i wanna take you.

1348
01:16:27,617 --> 01:16:28,916
Where is that?

1349
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:31,319
You gotta know everything.

1350
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,656
Man, I'm playing
like a salad up here.

1351
01:16:35,658 --> 01:16:36,624
A what?

1352
01:16:36,626 --> 01:16:38,025
A salad.

1353
01:16:38,027 --> 01:16:40,361
Getting tossed all
over the damn place.

1354
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:43,731
Gotta do something
about these roads.

1355
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:46,167
I gotta get me a new
set of legs that work.

1356
01:16:46,169 --> 01:16:49,270
Yeah, or a new
chair that works.

1357
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:52,807
Ain't nobody gonna buy me
a new chair, my brother.

1358
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:57,044
I'm stuck in this old beat up
raggedy mother fucker for life.

1359
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:01,015
You ready?

1360
01:17:01,017 --> 01:17:02,783
I been ready.

1361
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:15,029
For me?

1362
01:17:15,031 --> 01:17:17,264
Yeah, it's for you.

1363
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,374
Look at that.

1364
01:17:26,376 --> 01:17:28,209
Chrome.

1365
01:17:28,211 --> 01:17:30,044
White leather.

1366
01:17:30,046 --> 01:17:32,213
You even put an l on it.

1367
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,652
Well, shit! Don't just stand
there like you in a soup line.

1368
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:39,253
Help me in the mother
fucking vessel.

1369
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:43,691
Get that break on.

1370
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:44,825
-You ready?
-Yeah.

1371
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:45,993
One...

1372
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:47,128
-I got you.
-You got me?

1373
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:49,997
Bang.

1374
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:55,870
Oh, yeah.

1375
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:57,238
You got suspension.

1376
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,272
A cold one.

1377
01:17:58,274 --> 01:17:59,240
Oh, look at that, man.

1378
01:17:59,242 --> 01:18:00,141
You thought of everything.

1379
01:18:00,143 --> 01:18:01,342
Bmx wheels.

1380
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:02,843
Get that shit
out of the way.

1381
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:04,679
Yeah, let me get rid of this.

1382
01:18:04,681 --> 01:18:06,414
Give it a test drive.

1383
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:10,785
Woo, baby!
Look at this thing!

1384
01:18:10,787 --> 01:18:11,819
Uh!

1385
01:18:11,821 --> 01:18:13,688
Oh, hell yeah!

1386
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:14,722
You like those wheels?

1387
01:18:14,724 --> 01:18:15,790
I love these wheels, man.

1388
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:16,991
We can go off-roading
with these.

1389
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,367
You already know.

1390
01:18:27,803 --> 01:18:29,270
I know.

1391
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:30,171
Well, let's go
mother fucker.

1392
01:18:30,173 --> 01:18:32,239
Push me somewhere. Shit.

1393
01:18:34,744 --> 01:18:35,710
Get my roll on.

1394
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:37,144
Get my stroll on.

1395
01:18:37,146 --> 01:18:39,814
Rolling up with
the l on the back of my

1396
01:18:39,816 --> 01:18:43,350
chair with no fears,
crystal clear, my dear.

1397
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:45,986
Here he come, here he come
just having a little fun

1398
01:18:45,988 --> 01:18:48,856
and it's only just begun
underneath the sun.

1399
01:18:48,858 --> 01:18:52,226
Give him some legs,
give him some new wheels.

1400
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:55,296
What you say, boy?
Coppin' those pills

1401
01:18:55,298 --> 01:18:58,332
I'm Lucille,
you'll cop a pill.

1402
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:01,001
Even though my
legs I can't feel.

1403
01:19:35,337 --> 01:19:36,470
Hi, Doreen.

1404
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:39,340
Can I talk to
you for a second?

1405
01:19:39,342 --> 01:19:39,340
Melvin.

1406
01:19:39,342 --> 01:19:42,777
You're breaking the law by
being within one hundred

1407
01:19:42,779 --> 01:19:43,911
yards of me.

1408
01:19:43,913 --> 01:19:44,845
I know.

1409
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:45,513
I just need a...

1410
01:19:45,515 --> 01:19:45,513
Just need a minute.

1411
01:19:45,515 --> 01:19:48,382
Melvin, you got ten
seconds to back away

1412
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:50,050
before I call the cops.

1413
01:19:50,052 --> 01:19:51,952
Call the cops.

1414
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:54,288
I got nothing
to lose anymore.

1415
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:58,859
I'm lonely.

1416
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:02,363
Hm, that's what happens when
you screw your marriage up.

1417
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:07,401
I just wanna see Rex.

1418
01:20:07,403 --> 01:20:10,337
Wanna walk home from
school and see his face.

1419
01:20:10,339 --> 01:20:12,239
Smell him.

1420
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:16,277
I just want him to know
that I'm here in case

1421
01:20:16,279 --> 01:20:18,445
something really
does happen to me.

1422
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:21,448
How do you sit here and
pretend to care when you're

1423
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:23,551
the one who stopped helping
with his child support?

1424
01:20:23,553 --> 01:20:24,819
I never stopped.

1425
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:27,054
I put money in the bank.

1426
01:20:27,056 --> 01:20:28,355
Come on, Mel.

1427
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:30,991
Please let's not
play me for the fool.

1428
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:33,894
Doreen.

1429
01:20:33,896 --> 01:20:35,930
I got four thousand
dollars in Rex's name

1430
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:39,967
right here and
there's more coming.

1431
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:47,374
I just wanna see my boy.

1432
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:51,178
Just let me walk
him home once.

1433
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:54,882
Come on.

1434
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:58,352
I gotta be insane.

1435
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:34,955
Here we go!

1436
01:21:34,957 --> 01:21:36,624
Yippee!

1437
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,230
Hey, you.

1438
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:44,498
Yes?

1439
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,301
Where's my little man?
Where is he?

1440
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:47,301
I don't see him.

1441
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:49,536
-Here I am!
-Where are you?

1442
01:21:49,538 --> 01:21:50,938
Hey!

1443
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:52,439
Daddy, go faster.

1444
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:53,574
You wanna go faster?

1445
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:55,175
-Alright.
-Yeah.

1446
01:21:59,981 --> 01:22:01,916
Well, what do you know.

1447
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,019
Well, what do you
know, little man.

1448
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:09,323
We should get--

1449
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:11,358
I can stand like you. Look.

1450
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,559
I can stand like you.

1451
01:22:13,496 --> 01:22:14,428
You hanging on?

1452
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,463
Yeah.

1453
01:22:49,598 --> 01:22:50,731
Yeah!

1454
01:25:01,497 --> 01:25:01,495
Yes, sir!

1455
01:25:56,585 --> 01:25:57,651
Yes, sir!

1456
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:58,385
Hallelujah!

1457
01:25:58,387 --> 01:26:00,487
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1458
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:01,755
Woo!
