1
00:00:47,057 --> 00:00:49,150
<i>With only four weeks left to election day...</i>

2
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:51,716
<i>...candidates for New Mexico's</i>
<i>vacant Senate seat...</i>

3
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:54,161
<i>...former Democratic Congressman</i>
<i>Lloyd Wannamaker...</i>

4
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,198
<i>...and Republican businessman</i>
<i>Ray Garvin...</i>

5
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:58,359
Gentlemen, place your bets.

6
00:00:58,435 --> 00:01:01,461
$10 he'll say
these guys will sway the voters.

7
00:01:01,538 --> 00:01:03,836
- No. He'll say "woo."
- "Entice."

8
00:01:03,907 --> 00:01:06,068
<i>...in an effort to woo the state's...</i>

9
00:01:06,142 --> 00:01:10,169
Yes! Thank you. No checks, please.

10
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,414
I need those stats. I can't write him a
speech saying, "Take my word for it."

11
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:15,678
- Thanks.
- Julia.

12
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:18,118
- Hello, Julia.
- Larry, Curly, Moe.

13
00:01:19,055 --> 00:01:21,888
I see you wimped out
on the anti-development piece.

14
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,859
- Page 10, next to the crossword puzzle?
- Come on.

15
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:27,362
How's the school-aid speech?

16
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,864
I think we can really
make a difference for these kids.

17
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:30,973
If Lloyd'll get behind it.

18
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:34,368
Good, but we need to find a hotter button,
to give the campaign a boost.

19
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:35,836
Let me work on a few things.

20
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:36,997
Julia, listen.

21
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:39,371
I need you to write a speech
for Mrs. Wannamaker.

22
00:01:39,442 --> 00:01:42,240
Tomorrow, she's addressing
the Women's Historical Society.

23
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:46,305
The topic: pioneer suffragettes.
Here's your research. Thank you, dear.

24
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:49,284
Can you send 10 copies of this
up to my room?

25
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:50,341
Sorry.

26
00:01:50,453 --> 00:01:52,512
Hey, Pete!

27
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:54,489
Yeah, hon. Over here.

28
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,522
- Hi.
- Good afternoon.

29
00:01:59,596 --> 00:02:01,791
You have a reservation for me?

30
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:02,854
You're?

31
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,990
Eastwood. Clint Eastwood.

32
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:08,737
- Are you gonna give me your name?
- I'm kidding. Kevin Vallick.

33
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:10,797
Are you with one of the campaigns?

34
00:02:10,874 --> 00:02:13,638
Yeah, I just got hired
to write some speeches.

35
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,645
We'll see if I can't turn this baby around.
Know what I mean?

36
00:02:16,713 --> 00:02:18,374
Which candidate, sir?

37
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:21,316
What's-his-name.

38
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:24,348
Come on, help me out here.

39
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:26,412
- Republican or Democrat?
- Republican.

40
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:28,955
- Garvin.
- Garvin. That's him, yeah.

41
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:32,618
Second floor.
The elevator is right behind you.

42
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,318
Thank you.

43
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:36,058
- Nice, quiet room, right?
- Very quiet.

44
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,155
Okay.

45
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,994
- Dark?
- Dark.

46
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:40,934
- Soft mattress?
- Softest we've got.

47
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:43,165
- Real big one?
- The biggest we've got.

48
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,402
Because I cover a lot of territory
on a mattress.

49
00:02:46,676 --> 00:02:50,009
And I don't want you sneaking up there
at night and bothering me.

50
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:52,578
Hey, wait. Can you... Hold on!

51
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,579
- Hi.
- How you doing?

52
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:00,613
- Wish I didn't need it.
- Tell me about it.

53
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:02,775
My kid has this cough.

54
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:07,754
Let me see that for a second.
I don't think these are for kids.

55
00:04:07,824 --> 00:04:11,419
No, they're not.
In fact, they're not even for coughs.

56
00:04:11,594 --> 00:04:13,084
I know that. I realize that.

57
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:15,729
It's for me.
His cough is keeping me awake.

58
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:19,227
This is a tough call.
My grandmother is upstairs.

59
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:22,533
She just came through some surgery
and she can't sleep.

60
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:25,204
Really? How awful. What kind?

61
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:30,338
What kind? Extensive.
It was really extensive.

62
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:36,015
She had some liposuction work.

63
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:38,678
I know.

64
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:43,484
I said, "Grandmother, you're 80.
They're not beating down your door.

65
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,859
"What's a couple of pounds
here and there?" But she's vain.

66
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,660
- I'll give you one.
- I could split it.

67
00:04:51,734 --> 00:04:53,793
You want to split it? Perfect.

68
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,937
Let's go over it again.
Here's how the black-hole theory works.

69
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,477
Don't patronize me.

70
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:05,614
I'm not patronizing you.
I'm trying to teach you something.

71
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:07,013
Then be patient.

72
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:11,176
<i>Our unemployment checks are here.</i>
<i>Maybe if we put them together...</i>

73
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:16,515
<i>$280.85, plus...</i>

74
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,523
<i>$33 million and 55 cents.</i>

75
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:24,231
<i>Eddie, they made a mistake.</i>
<i>You gotta give the money back.</i>

76
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:55,720
Hi.

77
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:01,096
How's the kid?

78
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,334
It's sad. He was abducted by aliens.
How's Grandma?

79
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:09,403
Sore.
But I gotta say, her thighs look great.

80
00:06:10,513 --> 00:06:13,107
Sorry, I just dozed off. There you go.

81
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:14,513
Thank you very much.

82
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:21,450
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could you turn this up?

83
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:23,455
<i>I've always hated ottomans!</i>

84
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:26,025
<i>I just hate them! I hate them!</i>

85
00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:28,187
You've got to be kidding.

86
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:29,925
You don't like this show?

87
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:32,229
- It's crap!
- I wrote for this show.

88
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:37,569
No, I did.
I wrote for this show for a couple of years.

89
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:42,233
I shouldn't say that.
I've never watched a whole show.

90
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:45,245
It's okay. No, it's all right.

91
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:47,212
You probably watch PBS...

92
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:49,847
<i>"The Ditch That Divided New Mexico."</i>

93
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:52,183
<i>Is the Ditch a blight? Is it a necessity?</i>

94
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:54,655
<i>Is there a better way</i>
<i>to stop illegal immigration?</i>

95
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:56,815
- What is this?
- Mexico Ditch.

96
00:06:58,828 --> 00:07:00,887
It's to keep out illegal aliens.

97
00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:04,660
It's completely barbaric,
but Garvin is for it, of course.

98
00:07:05,101 --> 00:07:06,227
You don't like Garvin?

99
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:08,133
Republican simpleton.

100
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:09,527
You like him?

101
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,569
I like him better than the other guy,
Wannamaker.

102
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:16,203
At least he doesn't hang around
with junk-bond kings with slush funds.

103
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:20,409
I just prefer him over some tax-and-spend,
knee-jerk liberal is all.

104
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:26,613
- Let's drop it.
- Good idea.

105
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,021
You know what?

106
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:33,159
It's our first fight.
It's okay, it had to happen.

107
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:36,825
Sorry.

108
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:40,060
Let me know when I'm charming you.

109
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:42,434
Just a few more moves like that.

110
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,364
Pie?

111
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,673
You like breakfast burritos?

112
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:55,546
I know a great place across the border.
Takes 35 minutes.

113
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:56,949
We just had pie.

114
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:58,782
They're really good burritos.

115
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:00,618
Mom told me never to go with strangers.

116
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,682
- We'll pick her up. Where's she live?
- Rhode island.

117
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:07,224
All right, 45 minutes.
We'll put her in the back.

118
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:21,209
Best cure for insomnia?

119
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:26,246
Hot laundry. Take your laundry out
of the dryer and pile it on top of you.

120
00:08:26,783 --> 00:08:30,344
If you really want to sleep,
take some Fresca...

121
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:34,384
...beat in three raw eggs,
a touch of cayenne pepper.

122
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:36,183
Tried it.

123
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:38,516
I'm kidding.

124
00:08:42,632 --> 00:08:44,122
What do you do, Julia?

125
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:47,734
I write, too.

126
00:08:48,137 --> 00:08:49,661
Are you a reporter?

127
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,400
Yeah.

128
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:55,841
I saw your press badge on your bag here.

129
00:08:56,813 --> 00:09:00,146
I'm very observant. So who's "R. Freed"?

130
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,248
Fasten your seatbelt.

131
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:08,114
You always drive this fast?

132
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,248
No. This fast.

133
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:29,468
Are you divorced?

134
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:33,179
You got a tan line there.
I was just wondering.

135
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:34,579
Long engagement.

136
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:37,877
It's over?

137
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:41,689
Yep. Very boring. Not of interest.

138
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:47,591
- What's wrong with that?
- Wait, wait.

139
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,427
I'm celebrating my second anniversary...

140
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:56,533
...of my divorce.

141
00:10:01,444 --> 00:10:03,605
Very boring. Not of interest.

142
00:10:04,347 --> 00:10:06,144
Would you please find a station?

143
00:10:06,215 --> 00:10:08,945
I'm looking for a song.
Our song, if you must know.

144
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:13,411
We've graduated to "our"?

145
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:17,081
About two hours ago.
I wish you'd keep up, Julia.

146
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:18,783
- Did you figure it out?
- Yeah.

147
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,875
So what do you think? You know, "us."

148
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,705
You think we have a future together?

149
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:39,137
Good. Me, too.

150
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:50,989
What'd he say?

151
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:54,688
He said about another 10 minutes.
You don't speak Spanish?

152
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:57,631
Very romantic language.

153
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:06,102
That's pretty. What's that mean?

154
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:07,472
"May I have a towel?"

155
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:10,409
Be still my beating heart.

156
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:13,540
You gotta love the language.

157
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,678
Ls that cologne?

158
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:23,090
Black Flag. Great aftershave.

159
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:26,850
It's manly and, as you can see,
not a bug in sight.

160
00:11:27,763 --> 00:11:30,129
- What do you think?
- Not bad.

161
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:42,768
Breakfast?

162
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:45,006
Most important meal of the day.

163
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:15,040
Thank you.

164
00:13:03,526 --> 00:13:04,925
You know...

165
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:07,560
I mean...

166
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:24,910
The hand brake.

167
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,285
Kevin, we're rolling.

168
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,855
I know.

169
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,960
- The clutch.
- Just show me where your clutch...

170
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:41,087
On the car.

171
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,095
- Hi.
- Good morning.

172
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:18,797
This is...

173
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:20,331
Kevin.

174
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:24,272
- Dan.
- Nice to meet you.

175
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,467
- Kevin's a sitcom writer.
- I'm a sitcom writer.

176
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:28,669
I write for sitcoms.

177
00:14:29,712 --> 00:14:31,202
It's nice to meet you.

178
00:14:31,347 --> 00:14:34,578
Here's today's schedule, Julia.
I'll see you inside.

179
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:36,014
Great. Thanks.

180
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:41,482
Who's that? Your boss?

181
00:14:41,557 --> 00:14:45,789
It's like being caught by your dad.
It's bad enough they patronize me.

182
00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:49,092
- The best thing to do...
- You're full of advice. Find my shoe.

183
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:52,765
The best thing to do
when people try to patronize you is yell.

184
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:56,698
Shout. Let me put it on.
Speak louder than they do.

185
00:14:56,772 --> 00:15:00,173
They want you to wimp out.
Just raise your voice just a little bit.

186
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,009
Try it. Let me know tonight how it works.

187
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,907
We never got those breakfast burritos.

188
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:07,844
- What time?
- 8:00.

189
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,215
- My hair's a mess.
- It's perfect.

190
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:11,719
- 8:00, in the lobby?
- Out here.

191
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,035
- My stomach.
- Campaign food?

192
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,277
- Watch the fish.
- Too late.

193
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:40,675
Good luck.

194
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:44,479
Needs a touch-up, Lee.

195
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,451
Unacceptable, Annette.

196
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:58,061
Piece of shit, Kev.

197
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:02,763
12,999. And there's an even 13,000.

198
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:05,905
- Not bad. How are you?
- That's why I fired the guy.

199
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:08,409
See what you can do.
It's the old stump speech.

200
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:10,411
Give it some humor, some heart.

201
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:12,140
You didn't sleep last night.

202
00:16:12,214 --> 00:16:16,378
You know me.
Solid 10 minutes, I'm good for the day.

203
00:16:18,454 --> 00:16:21,287
Thanks for doing this,
coming out at the last minute.

204
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:24,349
I know how you swore off
this campaign stuff.

205
00:16:24,827 --> 00:16:27,489
Don't worry about it. I owed you one.

206
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:34,027
- Where's he giving this thing?
- The barrio, 3:00.

207
00:16:34,403 --> 00:16:36,769
What's this Ditch issue?

208
00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:39,103
- The Mexico Ditch?
- Yeah.

209
00:16:39,174 --> 00:16:42,109
- Why?
- Some reporter told me about it.

210
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:45,346
It's a sore point
with the Hispanic community.

211
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:49,548
Our guy's for it.
Don't bring it up in the barrio.

212
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:52,617
- I bet our opponent does.
- Interesting.

213
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:55,849
Spin it our way, Garvin will love you.

214
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,553
You think this guy's any good?

215
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,127
Of course he is. He's better than good.

216
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,595
Would I have called you if he wasn't good?
What reporter?

217
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,328
Just some reporter.

218
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:07,892
What's her name?

219
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:11,931
Listen, Kev, it's a cutthroat campaign here.

220
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:14,242
Don't do anything stupid.

221
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,072
And for God's sake,
don't mix with the enemy.

222
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:20,637
- Smile. Great, just one more.
- That's enough!

223
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:22,843
- Let's keep up the good work.
- Yes, sir.

224
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:26,117
- Mike, I have an idea for today's speech.
- Not now, Julia.

225
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:28,347
The Mexico Ditch. Time to attack.

226
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:29,948
Listen, we have been over this.

227
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:33,119
I am the Press Secretary.
I make the policy decisions.

228
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:34,592
Ls that all, dear?

229
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:36,460
No, it's not!

230
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,889
Excuse me?

231
00:17:39,735 --> 00:17:41,999
Firstly, the name is Julia, not "dear."

232
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:44,596
Secondly, I don't like being patronized,
Mr. Kratz.

233
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:47,639
I'm not patronizing you...

234
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:50,677
Why are you talking so loud?

235
00:17:50,746 --> 00:17:53,579
I am a speechwriter.
I have 10 years' experience.

236
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:57,775
If you think I can't handle it,
let's talk to the campaign manager.

237
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:06,658
Walk with me.

238
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:11,094
Wannamaker attacks on the Mexico Ditch.

239
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,964
We hold it till 4:00.
We get one untainted news cycle.

240
00:18:14,036 --> 00:18:18,166
Garvin can't hit back until tomorrow.
And guess where Garvin is speaking today?

241
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,730
The barrio.

242
00:18:20,175 --> 00:18:22,666
That's good.
I'm going to try to get that approved.

243
00:18:22,911 --> 00:18:26,745
And next time, don't be so angry.
We're in this together, don't forget.

244
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,050
It would be good
if he could say something in Spanish.

245
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:42,960
- The name of this town we're going to?
- San Jose.

246
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:45,592
Excuse me. Who are you?

247
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:47,299
I'm the new guy.

248
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:50,964
I'm sorry. Everyone, this is Kevin Vallick,
our new speechwriter.

249
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,439
He worked on the Tobin campaign in '84,
remember?

250
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,340
Straight from Hollywood.
He wrote <i>Chuck and Eddie.</i>

251
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:59,472
- I love that show!
- Thanks.

252
00:18:59,548 --> 00:19:03,382
Okay, listen.
This town, San Jose, is there a local hero?

253
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:05,784
Anybody save anybody from drowning
or anything?

254
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,989
Yeah, there's a spelling-bee winner.

255
00:19:08,057 --> 00:19:09,388
- Girl or boy?
- Girl.

256
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:11,752
Perfect.

257
00:19:11,827 --> 00:19:14,728
Let's do this.
Put her up on the stand with Garvin.

258
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:18,289
He'll say,
"I'd like to introduce someone to you<i>..."</i>

259
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:21,331
<i>...someone who makes me proud</i>
<i>to be an American.</i>

260
00:19:21,437 --> 00:19:25,806
<i>This young lady</i>
<i>is the state spelling-bee champion.</i>

261
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:33,041
Let's talk about Garvin's record
on immigration.

262
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:35,106
"I have a spotless record on..."

263
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,213
"My opponent says
he's a friend of minorities."

264
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:41,550
<i>My opponent claims</i>
<i>that he is a friend to minorities.</i>

265
00:19:41,657 --> 00:19:42,817
Yes, good.

266
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,416
"But actions speak louder than words."

267
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:49,563
<i>But anyone can speak words.</i>
<i>Acting actions...</i>

268
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:53,424
<i>...that's the important thing.</i>
<i>My opponent claims...</i>

269
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:56,402
"insecure friends...

270
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:58,431
"...soon become enemies."

271
00:19:58,674 --> 00:20:01,837
<i>Insecure enemies are soon at war.</i>

272
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:04,043
<i>This ditch...</i>

273
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:07,771
"...that separates the two great countries
of Mexico and America<i>..."</i>

274
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,480
<i>...it's really an act of friendship.</i>

275
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:14,146
- You gotta talk about the economics of it.
- No, it's a moral issue.

276
00:20:14,223 --> 00:20:18,853
"It rebuilds the Berlin Wall, brick by brick.
So I must ask my opponent<i>..."</i>

277
00:20:19,294 --> 00:20:22,991
<i>...torn down in Germany,</i>
<i>rebuilt in America?</i>

278
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:24,523
That's the sound bite.

279
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,033
It's a step backwards.

280
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:27,964
"Good fences make good neighbors."

281
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:30,196
"The beginning of a new intolerance."

282
00:20:30,405 --> 00:20:32,839
it is the American Wall.

283
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,010
I call it the "Friendship Ditch."

284
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,184
You're gonna get a sound bite out of this.

285
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:51,519
Well, we'll find out at 5:00.

286
00:20:55,397 --> 00:20:57,729
<i>It's the Channel 7 Action News</i>
<i>with Doris Wind.</i>

287
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,392
Lead story?

288
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:02,561
We ought to be,
if the Martians haven't landed in Taos.

289
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:04,728
Please.

290
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:07,298
<i>Good evening. Our top story tonight.</i>

291
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:12,469
<i>It was day two in the desperate struggle</i>
<i>of one small bear cub to stay alive.</i>

292
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:14,104
What?

293
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,414
Get out of here!

294
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:19,243
- How can he be the lead story?
- You're kidding me!

295
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,515
Can you try Channel 2?

296
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:23,682
<i>...at the bottom of a water well</i>
<i>in the Albuquerque Zoo.</i>

297
00:21:24,393 --> 00:21:27,021
<i>In what is turning into</i>
<i>a veritable race against time...</i>

298
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:28,459
it's the bear again.

299
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,226
Every channel is covering this story?

300
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,928
<i>...as we enter day two of "Bear Watch."</i>

301
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,233
Take a gun and put the little shit
out of his misery.

302
00:21:37,306 --> 00:21:38,671
Good idea.

303
00:21:40,776 --> 00:21:41,902
Still the bear.

304
00:21:41,977 --> 00:21:43,911
This bear is everywhere.

305
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:48,073
Now we're getting dancing bears!
This is really lovely.

306
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,831
<i>...wild bears were first trained,</i>
<i>and introduced into the circus...</i>

307
00:21:50,986 --> 00:21:53,887
- That's real cute.
- Look, the top hat, the cape.

308
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:55,924
I'm gonna grab my phone.

309
00:22:00,162 --> 00:22:03,097
- Hello.
- Hi. You out of breath?

310
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:04,859
Hey, how are you doing?

311
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,467
Well, you know,
45 minutes on the Stairmaster.

312
00:22:10,672 --> 00:22:12,606
- About tonight...
<i>- You're canceling.</i>

313
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:15,402
Why? 'Cause I ran out of gas?
I don't normally do that.

314
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,741
I think we ought to move past
the gas-gauge thing.

315
00:22:18,814 --> 00:22:21,009
<i>Frankly, it's shallow.</i>
<i>We're deeper than that.</i>

316
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:25,075
Shut up. Let's make it midnight.
Ls that too late?

317
00:22:26,255 --> 00:22:28,689
Are you kidding?
I just wake up at midnight.

318
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,052
Me, too.

319
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:32,082
It worked.

320
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,385
Good.

321
00:22:34,763 --> 00:22:35,889
What worked?

322
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:39,262
My boss.
He thought I was going to explode.

323
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:45,264
I told you. That's great.
The more intimidating you are, the better.

324
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,968
I might be out of line,
but can I make a suggestion?

325
00:22:48,043 --> 00:22:50,705
Tattoo. Really mean-looking tattoo.

326
00:22:50,846 --> 00:22:52,211
<i>You should get one.</i>

327
00:22:52,281 --> 00:22:55,808
My old boyfriend had a tattoo
on the inside of his lip.

328
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:01,481
I'm sorry?

329
00:23:01,556 --> 00:23:02,989
Know what it said?

330
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:09,363
"How am I driving?
Call 1-800" and then a number?

331
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:12,727
<i>Did he have a really big lip?</i>
<i>Was it Mick Jagger?</i>

332
00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:14,160
Got to go.

333
00:23:14,836 --> 00:23:17,532
Yeah, me, too. Okay.

334
00:23:18,073 --> 00:23:21,406
So, tonight then, right? Midnight.

335
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:23,267
Yeah, midnight.

336
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:29,573
<i>More and more,</i>
<i>the fate of animals means less and less.</i>

337
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:32,380
Put some pants on that bear!

338
00:23:32,888 --> 00:23:37,154
<i>Meanwhile, Teddy's mother,</i>
<i>Big Bertha, waits for some word...</i>

339
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:39,716
<i>...of Teddy's fate in the studio.</i>
<i>Back to you, Doris.</i>

340
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:40,921
They're killing us.

341
00:23:40,996 --> 00:23:43,396
<i>In other news, it was politics as usual.</i>

342
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:44,454
Here we go.

343
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:46,694
<i>With the election only 30 days away...</i>

344
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:49,828
<i>...both candidates vying</i>
<i>for New Mexico's vacant Senate seat...</i>

345
00:23:49,905 --> 00:23:53,739
<i>...argued the merits</i>
<i>of the so-called Friendship Ditch.</i>

346
00:23:53,942 --> 00:23:55,569
"Friendship" what?

347
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:58,177
Yes! Doctor Spin!

348
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:01,047
Wait.

349
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:03,217
<i>- Torn down in Germany...</i>
- Sound bite!

350
00:24:03,385 --> 00:24:04,545
<i>...rebuilt in America.</i>

351
00:24:04,686 --> 00:24:06,153
No more bets.

352
00:24:06,722 --> 00:24:10,055
No more bets?
How am I gonna get my beer money?

353
00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:14,354
<i>New Mexico business tycoon, Ray Garvin,</i>
<i>defended the Friendship Ditch...</i>

354
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:16,420
"Friendship" what?

355
00:24:16,531 --> 00:24:20,661
<i>Because the Friendship Ditch</i>
<i>ensures our security...</i>

356
00:24:20,969 --> 00:24:23,437
<i>...it ensures our friendship.</i>

357
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,905
They had to know
we were attacking the Ditch. How?

358
00:24:25,974 --> 00:24:27,874
"Friendship" what?

359
00:24:28,377 --> 00:24:30,277
Our resident genius.

360
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,013
Great speech, Kevin.

361
00:24:37,953 --> 00:24:41,218
There's a career seminar
at Mesa Junior High tonight.

362
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:44,816
- They want to hear from our speechwriter.
- I can't tonight.

363
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,723
I've got something important to do.

364
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:50,457
You'll be done by 8:00.
Why, seeing your reporter?

365
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:54,258
No way. I took your advice on that.

366
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:06,510
I'll give a short introduction,
then let you two start.

367
00:25:06,982 --> 00:25:08,210
Two?

368
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:12,184
She's a bit late.
Mr. Wannamaker's speechwriter.

369
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:14,951
- You're fine with that?
- Sure.

370
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:16,651
Here she is.

371
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:20,217
Mr. Vallick, meet Congressman
Wannamaker's speechwriter, Julia Mann.

372
00:25:20,328 --> 00:25:23,957
And Mr. Garvin's speechwriter,
Kevin Vallick.

373
00:25:27,202 --> 00:25:29,500
- Have you two met already?
- Yes.

374
00:25:29,971 --> 00:25:31,131
No.

375
00:25:31,206 --> 00:25:32,571
No. I'm sorry.

376
00:25:32,641 --> 00:25:35,303
I thought she was somebody I knew.

377
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:37,370
A reporter, actually.

378
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:42,781
Why don't we get started?
Miss Mann, could you come sit over here?

379
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:48,620
People, calm down.

380
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:53,053
Take your seats.

381
00:25:53,128 --> 00:25:58,464
I'm sure we've all heard the horror stories
about politics and politicians.

382
00:26:00,202 --> 00:26:02,466
Mr. Vallick and Miss Mann
were nice enough...

383
00:26:02,537 --> 00:26:04,937
...to take time out
from their busy schedule...

384
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,735
...to show us
there is a human side to politics.

385
00:26:15,584 --> 00:26:18,314
Maybe we'd better start with questions.

386
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:19,647
Anyone?

387
00:26:22,524 --> 00:26:26,290
I was interested in politics,
but my dad said that only liars go into it.

388
00:26:26,695 --> 00:26:28,925
- Bobby, that's not...
- I can respond to that.

389
00:26:28,997 --> 00:26:31,158
Most people who go into politics
aren't liars.

390
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:33,633
It's only opportunistic ones
from other fields...

391
00:26:33,702 --> 00:26:36,262
...say, TV comedy writing...

392
00:26:36,338 --> 00:26:37,999
...last stop of the untalented...

393
00:26:38,073 --> 00:26:39,563
...who turn into liars.

394
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:41,538
- I see.
- And hacks.

395
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:50,941
Maybe Mr. Vallick could offer us
a different perspective.

396
00:26:55,857 --> 00:26:58,348
There are frauds in politics.
But you know what?

397
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,853
There are also some passionate,
seemingly idealistic individuals...

398
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:05,695
- That's encouraging.
- ...who only later prove to be frauds.

399
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:10,902
Any other questions?

400
00:27:12,941 --> 00:27:16,104
Is there much interaction
between the two campaigns?

401
00:27:16,244 --> 00:27:18,678
Between Democrats and Republicans?

402
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:21,238
I think this is your area.

403
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,880
It's discouraged for campaigns to socialize.

404
00:27:25,153 --> 00:27:27,713
If one speechwriter, to use an example,
dated another...

405
00:27:27,923 --> 00:27:30,391
...they might reveal something
about their campaigns.

406
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:31,982
Some campaigns have spies...

407
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,491
...for just this purpose.

408
00:27:33,562 --> 00:27:35,792
To pursue someone
on the other campaign...

409
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:37,058
...to seduce her...

410
00:27:37,232 --> 00:27:39,792
- Or him.
- ...and try to find out her secrets.

411
00:27:39,935 --> 00:27:44,201
On the other hand, sometimes people
tend to get what's called "paranoid."

412
00:27:44,406 --> 00:27:47,068
Just because someone seems
interested in them...

413
00:27:47,142 --> 00:27:49,610
...doesn't mean they're after their secrets.

414
00:27:49,844 --> 00:27:54,747
Still, it's not paranoid to be suspicious
of a relationship that moves too fast...

415
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:56,807
...a chance meeting that isn't "chance."

416
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:58,883
Or somebody lying about her work.

417
00:27:58,954 --> 00:28:01,252
Or asks too much about the other's work.

418
00:28:01,323 --> 00:28:04,622
A speechwriter could, to use Miss...
Sorry, I forgot your name.

419
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:05,817
Mann.

420
00:28:06,695 --> 00:28:10,324
To use Miss Mann's earlier example,
a speechwriter could protect herself...

421
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:11,387
Or himself.

422
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:14,128
...from being compromised by not flirting...

423
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:16,170
...not sniffing around like a cat in heat.

424
00:28:18,807 --> 00:28:23,972
Or she might tell the other speechwriter,
"Peddle your shit elsewhere, scumbag."

425
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:25,707
I think we ought to...

426
00:28:25,814 --> 00:28:29,682
Clearly, once the infiltrator, or "slut spy"...

427
00:28:30,452 --> 00:28:31,885
...has been uncovered...

428
00:28:31,953 --> 00:28:34,922
...the other speechwriter's passion
for the campaign is renewed.

429
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,979
He'll need it.

430
00:28:36,057 --> 00:28:40,187
Because if he's a has-been, jumping from
field to field like some fuck-happy rabbit...

431
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:42,621
...inadequate due to his inexperience...

432
00:28:42,697 --> 00:28:45,666
Or the total lack of creativity
that comes with overexperience.

433
00:28:45,734 --> 00:28:50,228
...he'll need motivation to fight
somebody who believes in her cause!

434
00:28:50,672 --> 00:28:54,802
I'd like to thank both Mr. Vallick and
Miss Mann for their illuminating words...

435
00:28:54,876 --> 00:28:57,902
...about politics, the human side.

436
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:02,207
- You lied to me.
- You lied first.

437
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:04,411
- This isn't grade school.
- Actually, it is.

438
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:08,979
You used me. You took the Mexico Ditch.
You never heard of it till I mentioned it!

439
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:14,027
I didn't know you had it copyrighted.
What other forces of nature are yours?

440
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:16,120
I will keep this simple, in short syllables.

441
00:29:16,197 --> 00:29:20,531
L. Me. I do not. Not.
International symbol for "no."

442
00:29:20,602 --> 00:29:22,263
I do not want you near me!

443
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,928
Wait a minute.

444
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,170
Are we still on for midnight?

445
00:29:30,712 --> 00:29:34,148
<i>My opponent has accused me</i>
<i>of playing politics.</i>

446
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:38,116
<i>My opponent has accused me</i>
<i>of taking his issue...</i>

447
00:29:39,454 --> 00:29:42,218
<i>...the Friendship Ditch,</i>
<i>and using it for my own ends.</i>

448
00:29:42,524 --> 00:29:45,721
<i>Perhaps he should warn me</i>
<i>of any other issues...</i>

449
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,725
<i>...that are strictly his!</i>

450
00:29:48,396 --> 00:29:52,492
<i>Garvin continued to accuse Wannamaker</i>
<i>of using the Friendship Ditch.</i>

451
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:57,169
I wish Mr. Garvin would treat this process
with some dignity!

452
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:01,865
With only three weeks left
until the election...

453
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:06,842
<i>...why can't Mr. Garvin decide if he wants</i>
<i>to be a candidate or a businessman?</i>

454
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:12,918
<i>Why doesn't he stop jumping</i>
<i>from field to field like a slap-happy rabbit?</i>

455
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,627
<i>Come on, Mr. Garvin.</i>

456
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:24,096
<i>Why are you treating this campaign</i>
<i>like some slick sitcom...</i>

457
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:27,532
<i>...with sound bites worthy</i>
<i>of a Hollywood hack?</i>

458
00:30:28,737 --> 00:30:32,673
<i>That's why I'm traveling</i>
<i>across this great state of New Mexico.</i>

459
00:30:34,976 --> 00:30:37,001
Let's go, guys!

460
00:30:37,178 --> 00:30:39,203
So goodbye and God bless!

461
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:44,378
Move!

462
00:30:54,095 --> 00:30:56,029
Balloon Fiesta at 4:00.

463
00:30:56,164 --> 00:30:58,223
Wow. Baghdad Bob?

464
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:00,658
Slumming it in local news?

465
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:03,102
Just following the story.

466
00:31:03,271 --> 00:31:05,136
Come on. This isn't Iraq.

467
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,334
Well, it's early yet. Excuse me. Hi there.

468
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:17,749
Guess who?

469
00:31:19,487 --> 00:31:20,545
Bob.

470
00:31:21,723 --> 00:31:23,384
What are you doing here?

471
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:26,090
You glad to see me? Surprised to see me?

472
00:31:27,028 --> 00:31:29,223
A little less than thrilled to see me?

473
00:31:29,631 --> 00:31:31,121
What was the middle one?

474
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:33,930
I'm just here on business.

475
00:31:34,636 --> 00:31:35,830
Albuquerque's been invaded.

476
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:38,797
We're doing the Senate races.

477
00:31:38,907 --> 00:31:41,068
Network sent me to cover New Mexico.

478
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:45,243
Okay, I chose New Mexico.
It's a real interesting story.

479
00:31:45,513 --> 00:31:46,912
And getting more interesting.

480
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:49,110
It's a real honor.

481
00:31:49,184 --> 00:31:52,881
Thank you.
I'm not sure how long I'll be with you.

482
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:56,481
Yeah, Bob's a busy man.

483
00:31:56,691 --> 00:32:00,491
The Congressman is free for a minute.
He'd love to chat.

484
00:32:01,563 --> 00:32:03,724
I'll be there in a little while.

485
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:07,734
Jules, you look...

486
00:32:09,938 --> 00:32:13,897
I'll just get this out of the way
and be right back.

487
00:32:14,843 --> 00:32:17,505
I'll be right back. We have to talk.

488
00:32:18,379 --> 00:32:19,710
Oh, my God.

489
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:45,135
- Julia, bring those position papers.
- I got them.

490
00:32:45,206 --> 00:32:47,868
Pete, hold your horses.
We'll be there in two seconds.

491
00:32:47,942 --> 00:32:49,807
Get some cut-aways of the balloons.

492
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:51,701
Jules, what's the story?

493
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,379
Damn. What are they doing here?

494
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:57,542
Bob, I'm a little busy right now.

495
00:32:57,752 --> 00:33:00,243
He's a beautiful baby.

496
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:02,346
We need to step over here.

497
00:33:02,891 --> 00:33:06,349
What this state needs
is more frigging photo opportunities.

498
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:09,521
What about this junk-bond king, Proctor?

499
00:33:09,597 --> 00:33:11,565
I heard rumors Garvin took
a $500,000 bribe.

500
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:14,928
If you can prove that, we'll win.

501
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,935
So when is the debate?

502
00:33:17,138 --> 00:33:18,833
Not set. Garvin's dragging his feet.

503
00:33:18,907 --> 00:33:20,704
Why did you move out?

504
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:22,237
No comment.

505
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,505
You didn't even leave me a note.
Two years...

506
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:25,568
Two years of...

507
00:33:26,648 --> 00:33:28,309
Let's not get into this right now.

508
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:30,180
No, say it.

509
00:33:30,618 --> 00:33:33,348
Bob, you don't want a fiancée.
You want a fan club.

510
00:33:35,523 --> 00:33:37,650
Baghdad Bob. it's a pleasure to meet you.

511
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:39,326
You, too, sir. How are you?

512
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:42,591
We're having a little get-together
at my vacation home on Thursday.

513
00:33:42,664 --> 00:33:44,495
Jules, I'm sorry.

514
00:33:51,439 --> 00:33:53,430
Time for happy hour with the press.

515
00:33:53,508 --> 00:33:56,170
Wannamaker looks bad on the debate.
Spin it so...

516
00:33:56,277 --> 00:33:57,608
Garvin's dodging us.

517
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,647
One hour till press deadline. Hit 'em hard.

518
00:33:59,714 --> 00:34:03,514
Hi, guys. Listen, on this debate front...

519
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:05,177
ls your guy backing off?

520
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:08,916
No. Wannamaker's position on the debate
is clear. He wants one.

521
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,582
But where's Garvin?

522
00:34:10,658 --> 00:34:13,627
Everyone keeps talking about this debate.
It's a non-issue.

523
00:34:13,695 --> 00:34:15,890
The real story here is Garvin's cowardice.

524
00:34:16,164 --> 00:34:18,826
I could almost call Wannamaker cowardly.

525
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,231
Excuse me?

526
00:34:21,202 --> 00:34:23,534
Sorry, I wasn't talking to you.

527
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:25,772
No, you were plagiarizing me.

528
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,005
I didn't even hear what you said.

529
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:29,871
You're standing right behind me!

530
00:34:30,144 --> 00:34:33,636
Obviously, you're more conscious of me
than I am of you.

531
00:34:33,748 --> 00:34:37,206
How could I not be?
You're wearing a quart of cologne.

532
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:39,753
It's aftershave, and it spilled.

533
00:34:39,821 --> 00:34:42,585
I wouldn't put cologne on for a balloon...

534
00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:45,691
God bless you! Vote on the 8th!

535
00:34:48,062 --> 00:34:49,620
Leave me alone, please.

536
00:34:49,697 --> 00:34:51,062
I'm on my way to my car.

537
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,497
Which, by the way, pings...

538
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:54,928
...ever since you drove it,
thank you very much.

539
00:34:55,503 --> 00:34:58,336
Hey, there's... What's his name?
Beijing Bob?

540
00:34:58,406 --> 00:34:59,737
That's Bob Freed.

541
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:03,034
That's R. Freed?

542
00:35:04,012 --> 00:35:07,345
Wait a minute. Nah.
You and Mr. Flak Jacket?

543
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:08,813
Are you jealous?

544
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:11,146
Why? it's clear who you're interested in.

545
00:35:11,352 --> 00:35:13,377
Yeah, and getting clearer.

546
00:35:15,056 --> 00:35:17,581
- Going my way?
- I'll give you a lift.

547
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:57,864
<i>Although no one can actually be sure</i>
<i>the bear cub has touched the meals...</i>

548
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:02,936
<i>...one can assume that after several days</i>
<i>of this, a cub would be pretty hungry.</i>

549
00:36:03,237 --> 00:36:07,230
<i>Is there any word</i>
<i>on what the food consisted of?</i>

550
00:36:07,341 --> 00:36:10,003
<i>Yes, Doris. Some ham, lettuce...</i>

551
00:36:10,244 --> 00:36:14,510
<i>...onions, various cold cuts,</i>
<i>and a strangely poignant touch, honey.</i>

552
00:36:18,786 --> 00:36:23,780
<i>Wealthy New Mexican businessman Alan</i>
<i>Proctor christened the Santa Fe racetrack.</i>

553
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:27,961
<i>The much-disputed gambling site</i>
<i>is half-owned by the tycoon...</i>

554
00:36:34,302 --> 00:36:36,793
<i>My sympathies with labor run deep.</i>

555
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:40,067
<i>My sympathies with unions are strong.</i>

556
00:36:40,975 --> 00:36:43,637
<i>Let me tell you a little</i>
<i>something about myself.</i>

557
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:46,377
<i>I come from a blue-collar background.</i>

558
00:36:46,647 --> 00:36:50,640
<i>My dad worked for the Southern Pacific</i>
<i>ever since he came to this country.</i>

559
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:55,753
<i>I started working for the rail road</i>
<i>when I was 16 years old.</i>

560
00:36:56,491 --> 00:36:58,516
<i>Hard, 12-hour days.</i>

561
00:36:58,726 --> 00:37:03,163
<i>Picture the grime, the di</i> rt,
<i>the smell of sweat, the despair.</i>

562
00:37:03,564 --> 00:37:05,725
<i>Can't you hear the whistle blowing?</i>

563
00:37:05,867 --> 00:37:08,802
<i>Rise up, early in the morn!</i>

564
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,231
<i>Can't you hear the captain shouting:</i>

565
00:37:18,813 --> 00:37:20,610
<i>"Dinah, blow your horn?"</i>

566
00:37:29,624 --> 00:37:32,218
<i>There's someone in the kitchen with Dinah.</i>

567
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:34,693
<i>There's someone in the kitchen...</i>

568
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:36,289
<i>...I know.</i>

569
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:39,125
<i>Yes, kitchen...</i>

570
00:37:39,367 --> 00:37:43,360
<i>Let's talk about something I know.</i>

571
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,572
<i>And I know about the kitchen.</i>

572
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,334
<i>My opponent wants</i>
<i>to keep the women in the kitchen:</i>

573
00:37:48,442 --> 00:37:50,967
<i>Dinah, Alice, whomever.</i>

574
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:54,410
<i>But I feel that this is un-American.</i>

575
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:55,608
Who phoned?

576
00:37:55,683 --> 00:37:58,379
He said he had approved changes
for the Teleprompter.

577
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,447
I want security measures tightened.

578
00:38:00,521 --> 00:38:04,685
If I find anyone fraternizing
with the other side, they are fired!

579
00:38:05,593 --> 00:38:06,958
What did he sound like?

580
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:13,323
Listen, you...

581
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:16,434
Julia, hi! Gosh, it's nice to hear from you.

582
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:18,662
My organizer! I want it back!

583
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,271
Did you lose something?

584
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:23,102
I suppose you had nothing to do with
the Teleprompter?

585
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:27,079
Why is it always "me, me, me"?
What about my needs?

586
00:38:28,783 --> 00:38:31,616
Promise me that you'll get
professional help.

587
00:38:39,126 --> 00:38:41,026
"Hey, little girl, is your daddy home?

588
00:38:41,095 --> 00:38:43,893
"Did he go and leave you all alone?"

589
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:46,725
Or something like that.

590
00:38:47,168 --> 00:38:48,692
Want to go out?

591
00:38:55,977 --> 00:38:59,708
Kev, this isn't cutting it.
It's supposed to be a friendly speech.

592
00:39:00,481 --> 00:39:01,539
Comfortable?

593
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,017
"Wannamaker has run a sloppy,
inept and hostile campaign."

594
00:39:06,153 --> 00:39:07,142
Good.

595
00:39:07,355 --> 00:39:11,849
"He's incompetent, crooked, mean-spirited
and out of touch with the voters?"

596
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:13,583
What's the problem?

597
00:39:14,095 --> 00:39:15,255
Where's the friendly?

598
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:16,421
Read the next line.

599
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:20,257
"Still, he has the right to run."

600
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:21,801
There you go.

601
00:39:25,106 --> 00:39:26,869
I don't understand...

602
00:39:36,517 --> 00:39:37,609
That's...

603
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:41,113
Wannamaker's staff,
their campaign manager.

604
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:43,450
What happened to
not mixing with the enemy?

605
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:45,122
What are you doing?

606
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,384
My back.

607
00:39:47,461 --> 00:39:50,897
It helps it a lot
if I crawl around on the floor like this.

608
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:55,594
- Debate negotiations. I'll introduce you.
- No! That's okay.

609
00:39:57,505 --> 00:39:59,530
So lighten up on the vitriol.

610
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,303
Wannamaker will back off soon anyway.
You know Julia Mann?

611
00:40:04,979 --> 00:40:07,573
Campaign-osaurus.
She's been on a dozen of them.

612
00:40:07,648 --> 00:40:10,139
Didn't you meet her
at that junior-high career thing?

613
00:40:10,217 --> 00:40:12,048
Yeah, right. Julia Mann.

614
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,652
We hear she's the one mixing the mud.

615
00:40:17,825 --> 00:40:22,592
My back.
It helps a lot if I lean against something.

616
00:40:24,231 --> 00:40:28,497
Well, she doesn't know it yet,
but at the end of the week, she's out.

617
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,501
What do you mean "out"?

618
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:32,095
They're replacing her.

619
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:35,700
Ever since the Friendship Ditch,
you've been kicking her butt.

620
00:40:37,445 --> 00:40:40,141
It's exciting to see.
What's doing it to you?

621
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,215
I'll explain later.

622
00:40:57,865 --> 00:40:58,854
Let's go.

623
00:40:59,033 --> 00:41:00,193
I'll be there in a second.

624
00:41:00,434 --> 00:41:02,902
Great. We'll just go wait out here.

625
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:46,933
<i>What did your boyfriend's tattoo say?</i>

626
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:48,533
I can't believe you!

627
00:43:48,602 --> 00:43:52,163
I've been awake for three hours.
You don't tell me, it'll be three more.

628
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:53,772
My little overachiever.

629
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:57,609
If I apologize,
will you tell me what the tattoo said?

630
00:43:58,212 --> 00:44:00,112
I'm sorry about the Ditch.

631
00:44:00,181 --> 00:44:02,877
But I didn't know you were
with the other campaign...

632
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:05,441
...so I didn't know that I was stealing.

633
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,580
As far as the Teleprompter goes, well...

634
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:10,653
Boy, you know...

635
00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:12,722
That got out of hand.

636
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,650
I've got a comedy background.

637
00:44:15,462 --> 00:44:18,761
<i>It was too good to pass up.</i>
<i>I got weak. I'm sorry.</i>

638
00:44:18,832 --> 00:44:21,426
It won't happen again. How's that?

639
00:44:23,337 --> 00:44:24,668
Okay.

640
00:44:24,772 --> 00:44:27,900
<i>- Good night.</i>
- Good night. On the upper lip?

641
00:44:27,975 --> 00:44:29,670
No. Good night, Kevin.

642
00:44:29,777 --> 00:44:32,940
<i>Wait. Julia, listen to me for a second.</i>

643
00:44:34,949 --> 00:44:37,179
I've got to tell you something.

644
00:44:38,485 --> 00:44:40,009
Go ahead.

645
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,951
What are you doing right now?

646
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,186
Can you help me out for a sex?
Did I say "sex"? I meant "sec."

647
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,321
<i>- Just for a second?</i>
- No!

648
00:44:51,765 --> 00:44:52,959
With what?

649
00:44:54,768 --> 00:44:57,032
Damn car problem.

650
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:05,811
<i>The problem with the Broncos is,</i>
<i>they got no offensive line.</i>

651
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:09,541
So how you been?

652
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:14,587
Kevin, the only reason
I agreed to meet with you is...

653
00:45:14,655 --> 00:45:16,850
Why? Did you miss me?

654
00:45:20,794 --> 00:45:22,591
I'm engaged.

655
00:45:26,467 --> 00:45:28,298
I wanted you to know, that's all.

656
00:45:32,539 --> 00:45:36,031
Anyway, what was it
you needed to tell me?

657
00:45:38,612 --> 00:45:39,601
Nothing.

658
00:45:47,621 --> 00:45:48,645
Car trouble?

659
00:45:48,722 --> 00:45:50,656
No, I'm fine.

660
00:45:51,025 --> 00:45:52,287
Nice rental.

661
00:45:55,062 --> 00:45:58,793
Did you see the polls? We're sliding.

662
00:45:58,866 --> 00:46:00,993
That's temporary.
We're gonna get him on that...

663
00:46:03,203 --> 00:46:04,261
On what?

664
00:46:06,573 --> 00:46:09,565
The thing we were talking about.

665
00:46:10,511 --> 00:46:11,443
What thing?

666
00:46:11,578 --> 00:46:14,877
The thing with the other thing.

667
00:46:19,153 --> 00:46:20,711
What on earth?

668
00:46:21,755 --> 00:46:24,451
The fish? The porpoise? The whale?

669
00:46:24,558 --> 00:46:26,389
Can we talk about this later?

670
00:46:26,527 --> 00:46:29,724
- Oh, you mean...
- Let's not talk about it now!

671
00:46:29,863 --> 00:46:30,887
Okay?

672
00:46:32,132 --> 00:46:35,795
Ls something wrong?
You're acting kind of unfocused lately.

673
00:46:36,103 --> 00:46:37,764
What? Unfocused?

674
00:46:38,138 --> 00:46:40,732
Never mind. it's all right. We'll talk.

675
00:46:48,082 --> 00:46:51,609
That's it, Kevin. You're on your own.

676
00:46:51,785 --> 00:46:53,275
Wait a minute.

677
00:46:53,454 --> 00:46:57,117
I've been thinking about what...
Wait a minute!

678
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:00,992
Congratulations on the engagement.
I mean it.

679
00:47:02,162 --> 00:47:05,654
There.
There's no reason we can't be friends now.

680
00:47:06,567 --> 00:47:08,159
We're in a campaign!

681
00:47:08,268 --> 00:47:09,701
So?

682
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:13,536
Look at your hands.
You can't go back to the hotel like that.

683
00:47:14,475 --> 00:47:17,171
A framed picture of J.F.K.
in the living room?

684
00:47:17,244 --> 00:47:19,804
In the kitchen. You're good at this.

685
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,605
You probably graduated
near the top of your class.

686
00:47:22,683 --> 00:47:24,878
- Valedictorian.
- Very near.

687
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:26,747
You were class clown?

688
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,880
I was voted
"Most Likely to Embarrass My Family."

689
00:47:29,957 --> 00:47:31,219
You'd have hated me.

690
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:33,486
No, I would have avoided you.

691
00:47:34,828 --> 00:47:38,491
- You always wanted to write sitcoms?
- No. I always wanted to write.

692
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:39,964
I was a speechwriter before.

693
00:47:40,033 --> 00:47:43,400
Then I found out I believed in my words
more than the candidates did.

694
00:47:44,037 --> 00:47:45,527
So I quit.

695
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:50,174
Sitcoms are depressing, too,
but the money's a whole lot better.

696
00:47:51,445 --> 00:47:52,776
You're funny.

697
00:47:54,515 --> 00:47:58,576
- Cynical on the outside, but inside you're...
- What? Not like Bob?

698
00:47:59,286 --> 00:48:02,585
Ls Bob warm and gushy on the inside?

699
00:48:03,557 --> 00:48:06,549
Ls that why you guys decided
to get engaged?

700
00:48:07,261 --> 00:48:10,753
We just need some time, that's all,
to fall in love again.

701
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:14,756
What?

702
00:48:15,169 --> 00:48:16,158
Nothing.

703
00:48:16,804 --> 00:48:18,294
How come I don't I trust you?

704
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:20,470
I honestly don't know.

705
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:23,835
- What the hell are you doing?
- Take your shoes off.

706
00:48:29,283 --> 00:48:30,341
Hey, Julia.

707
00:48:31,852 --> 00:48:34,685
What would you do
if you weren't campaigning?

708
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:38,648
You know, what if you were...

709
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,485
What if you quit?

710
00:48:41,328 --> 00:48:45,458
I won't quit.
I spent 10 years on losing campaigns.

711
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:47,862
Clinton made it, now it's my turn.

712
00:48:48,902 --> 00:48:50,267
You want some advice?

713
00:48:50,337 --> 00:48:53,898
You're a regular Dear Abby, aren't you?
Get in here. Put your feet in.

714
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:57,200
Your boy Wannamaker...

715
00:48:57,377 --> 00:48:59,208
...he's a total stiff.

716
00:49:00,781 --> 00:49:02,271
It warms up.

717
00:49:03,217 --> 00:49:04,775
You have nice feet.

718
00:49:04,852 --> 00:49:05,841
Thanks.

719
00:49:06,487 --> 00:49:08,751
Well, you know, I work out.

720
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:11,482
Yours aren't so bad.

721
00:49:11,959 --> 00:49:14,359
I like feet. They reveal things.

722
00:49:14,895 --> 00:49:17,989
They say something
about somebody's personality.

723
00:49:21,502 --> 00:49:23,129
My advice, Julia?

724
00:49:23,504 --> 00:49:26,496
Wannamaker needs a "You see, Timmy."

725
00:49:27,474 --> 00:49:29,374
- "You see, Timmy."
- What language is that?

726
00:49:29,443 --> 00:49:33,402
At the end of every <i>Lassie</i>, Timmy's mom
would say to him, "You see, Timmy..."

727
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:37,048
- She'd teach him a lesson.
- I can't believe this.

728
00:49:37,885 --> 00:49:41,719
It was always hopeful, always had heart.
That's what his voters are waiting for.

729
00:49:41,788 --> 00:49:45,349
They want to see if the guy
has anything going on inside.

730
00:49:46,527 --> 00:49:47,619
When does it get warmer?

731
00:49:48,228 --> 00:49:50,890
Why are you telling me this?
It doesn't help you.

732
00:49:52,366 --> 00:49:53,833
You're right.

733
00:49:54,468 --> 00:49:58,097
I'm doing it because I like you.

734
00:50:00,307 --> 00:50:05,210
That and I know Wannamaker can't
pull it off, so I'm not worried.

735
00:50:06,413 --> 00:50:10,611
He doesn't get it.
Campaigns are about one thing: winning.

736
00:50:11,251 --> 00:50:13,845
No. They're about changing the world.

737
00:50:14,154 --> 00:50:17,146
I hate how people treat it like it's a game...

738
00:50:17,224 --> 00:50:19,988
...like it's a race with winners and losers.

739
00:50:20,294 --> 00:50:22,319
What we do affects people.

740
00:50:22,796 --> 00:50:26,459
The people who do anything to win,
do anything to keep on winning.

741
00:50:27,301 --> 00:50:28,563
Why are you staring at me?

742
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:35,171
Because I haven't heard anyone
talk like that in a long time.

743
00:50:38,445 --> 00:50:39,776
You should run.

744
00:50:43,984 --> 00:50:44,973
Julia?

745
00:50:45,586 --> 00:50:48,453
I want to tear your clothes off.

746
00:51:04,271 --> 00:51:05,761
All right! Truce!

747
00:51:06,273 --> 00:51:07,365
Truce.

748
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:10,672
All right, wait!

749
00:51:11,411 --> 00:51:15,245
Really a truce this time. All right?
I mean it.

750
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,415
It's just immature and foolish.

751
00:51:19,052 --> 00:51:20,713
Look, your hair is a mess.

752
00:51:31,865 --> 00:51:34,095
I know what you're going to say. I can't.

753
00:51:35,068 --> 00:51:37,434
They're going to fire you on Friday.

754
00:51:51,018 --> 00:51:53,009
Why do I do these things?

755
00:52:03,463 --> 00:52:07,923
<i>...an Albuquerque firm donated</i>
<i>heavy equipment to help...</i>

756
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:10,970
<i>President Clinton has set aside</i>
<i>federal matching funds.</i>

757
00:52:11,038 --> 00:52:14,132
<i>More importantly,</i>
<i>he sent a note of suppo</i> rt.

758
00:52:14,307 --> 00:52:16,207
<i>The President's note read, in part:</i>

759
00:52:16,276 --> 00:52:19,712
<i>"America is proud of your courage</i>
<i>and your diligence.</i>

760
00:52:20,047 --> 00:52:22,208
<i>"All we can do now is pray."</i>

761
00:52:22,516 --> 00:52:26,577
<i>That seems to sum up the mood on this,</i>
<i>day 15 of "Bear Watch."</i>

762
00:52:27,688 --> 00:52:30,816
<i>How have area schoolchildren reacted</i>
<i>to Teddy's dilemma?</i>

763
00:52:30,924 --> 00:52:33,188
<i>Child psychologists say...</i>

764
00:52:37,497 --> 00:52:41,297
At a certain point, you don't worry
about the Scuds and you just do the job.

765
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:42,925
The audience has the right to know.

766
00:52:46,506 --> 00:52:48,838
He's much sexier in person.

767
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:53,511
I've enjoyed experiences all over the world:
Grenada, Belfast...

768
00:52:54,847 --> 00:52:56,508
I heard he's gay.

769
00:52:58,117 --> 00:53:00,278
Come on. He's engaged.

770
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,613
He was whistling show tunes
in the elevator.

771
00:53:09,328 --> 00:53:10,488
Top you off there?

772
00:53:11,431 --> 00:53:13,490
No, I can't drink that much.

773
00:53:15,168 --> 00:53:16,635
Can you do this?

774
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,501
Here. Try it.

775
00:53:18,704 --> 00:53:19,864
Why?

776
00:53:19,972 --> 00:53:23,703
I don't know.
Haven't you done anything just to do it?

777
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:26,401
You ever get a tattoo?

778
00:53:26,479 --> 00:53:27,503
- Once.
- Where?

779
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,512
Maui.

780
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:29,513
No, I mean...

781
00:53:29,615 --> 00:53:31,276
Did you hear I'm getting married?

782
00:53:31,818 --> 00:53:33,911
Yeah. I heard.

783
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:36,752
Dumb move.

784
00:53:38,124 --> 00:53:42,788
Do you know any married people
who are happy? What are you doing it for?

785
00:53:43,362 --> 00:53:47,856
In my life, I need some security.
You see that? Iraq. Shrapnel.

786
00:53:48,501 --> 00:53:49,763
Wow.

787
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:52,302
See that?

788
00:53:52,705 --> 00:53:55,367
A guy threw up on me once
in a bar in Pittsburgh.

789
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,601
Brutal.

790
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:05,277
Let me run something by you, Bob.

791
00:54:05,351 --> 00:54:06,545
You can call me "Baggie."

792
00:54:07,487 --> 00:54:08,476
Really?

793
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:12,288
Okay.
Let me run something by you, Baggie.

794
00:54:12,525 --> 00:54:16,484
How about a piece on Garvin's handlers?

795
00:54:16,762 --> 00:54:18,457
A behind-the-scenes kind of thing.

796
00:54:18,531 --> 00:54:20,089
- Been done.
- But not like this.

797
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:24,063
You could follow us around,
all day long, all night long.

798
00:54:24,203 --> 00:54:27,263
See how I write a speech
from beginning to end.

799
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:29,464
Interesting. What's the access?

800
00:54:29,575 --> 00:54:32,567
Open. No closed doors. Day and night.

801
00:54:33,579 --> 00:54:35,604
Spend all your time with me. I don't care.

802
00:54:36,415 --> 00:54:39,748
I'll call it <i>Handling of a Candidate</i>
or something.

803
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,345
- Nah, I don't know.
- What? You don't like it?

804
00:54:43,422 --> 00:54:45,617
I'd have to be with you for the campaign.

805
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:47,989
I made a commitment
to be with my fiancée.

806
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,550
What the hell, Baggie?

807
00:54:50,263 --> 00:54:53,858
She'll understand.
What kind of woman wouldn't understand?

808
00:54:54,934 --> 00:54:55,923
Damn.

809
00:54:56,435 --> 00:54:58,926
- I got a damn canker sore.
- Those are painful.

810
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:02,231
They hurt. Ever get them?
Up here or down here?

811
00:55:06,779 --> 00:55:07,871
You have a lip tattoo?

812
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:09,270
A lip tattoo?

813
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:10,846
Oh, my God!

814
00:55:11,117 --> 00:55:13,779
We have to be able to spin this.

815
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,111
- A disaster!
- Channel 2.

816
00:55:17,623 --> 00:55:19,784
<i>We interrupt our regular broadcast...</i>

817
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:24,762
<i>...to bring you this special news flash.</i>
<i>On this, day 16 of "Bear Watch"...</i>

818
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:27,222
<i>...Teddy has been safely rescued...</i>

819
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,632
<i>...from a well at the Albuquerque Zoo.</i>

820
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:32,804
<i>Senatorial candidate Lloyd Wannamaker...</i>

821
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:35,966
<i>...was the first</i>
<i>to pull the bear cub to safety.</i>

822
00:55:36,642 --> 00:55:39,611
<i>Wannamaker took time out</i>
<i>from his political campaign...</i>

823
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:42,477
<i>...to dig with other concerned citizens.</i>

824
00:55:47,587 --> 00:55:49,578
We're living a nightmare.

825
00:55:53,926 --> 00:55:56,520
<i>With other concerned citizens looking on...</i>

826
00:55:56,629 --> 00:55:58,563
<i>...Senate candidate Lloyd Wannamaker...</i>

827
00:55:58,631 --> 00:56:02,067
<i>...was the first to pull</i>
<i>the exhausted cub to safety.</i>

828
00:56:02,168 --> 00:56:04,762
<i>This bear is truly an inspiration.</i>

829
00:56:09,508 --> 00:56:11,169
<i>Even when all is lost...</i>

830
00:56:11,444 --> 00:56:14,936
<i>...there's always a light</i>
<i>at the end of the well.</i>

831
00:56:15,181 --> 00:56:16,842
No more than three points.

832
00:56:17,116 --> 00:56:21,109
Three points?
The guy just saved Winnie the Pooh...

833
00:56:21,454 --> 00:56:23,581
...and you say three points!

834
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:27,281
Why didn't you think of it, genius?

835
00:56:28,227 --> 00:56:30,218
You, too, Annette. He's your guy.

836
00:56:30,329 --> 00:56:35,266
<i>Tycoon Alan Proctor was in the news again</i>
<i>with rumblings from a grand jury...</i>

837
00:56:36,569 --> 00:56:38,560
Mr. Vallick? For you.

838
00:56:51,584 --> 00:56:53,245
You won't believe it!

839
00:56:53,586 --> 00:56:55,918
Julia, this is dangerous.
This is enemy territory.

840
00:56:56,155 --> 00:56:57,816
They made me Press Secretary!

841
00:56:58,090 --> 00:56:59,421
You're kidding!

842
00:57:00,092 --> 00:57:02,583
That's great! Good for you.

843
00:57:02,662 --> 00:57:06,598
Let me ask you about the bear thing.
That was your idea, right?

844
00:57:06,866 --> 00:57:12,702
Yes! They fired Kratz and made me
Press Secretary. I owe it all to you.

845
00:57:12,772 --> 00:57:15,935
Yes, I do,
because that idea and everything...

846
00:57:16,108 --> 00:57:18,167
Anyway, I just wanted to thank you.

847
00:57:18,778 --> 00:57:21,269
I wish there was a way I could repay you.

848
00:57:21,614 --> 00:57:23,775
But perhaps you'll accept a mint.

849
00:57:24,116 --> 00:57:25,105
A mint?

850
00:57:28,788 --> 00:57:30,449
Well, a mint.

851
00:57:31,457 --> 00:57:34,119
It was good advice
and the No. 1 news story.

852
00:57:34,193 --> 00:57:36,320
Hang on. You're right. And...

853
00:57:36,896 --> 00:57:37,885
...some shampoo.

854
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:41,793
Mint and shampoo.
Done deal. And it's organic.

855
00:57:45,404 --> 00:57:48,567
So what did Bob say about all this?

856
00:57:49,241 --> 00:57:50,731
I haven't told him yet.

857
00:57:51,577 --> 00:57:52,737
Really?

858
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:54,841
You came here first?

859
00:57:55,414 --> 00:57:58,679
Yeah. Well, you were closer...

860
00:57:58,751 --> 00:58:00,275
...geographically.

861
00:58:04,924 --> 00:58:07,984
I'm pretty close now, actually,
geographically.

862
00:58:18,938 --> 00:58:20,166
Anyway...

863
00:58:21,273 --> 00:58:23,935
...I better go. I have to go tell...

864
00:58:24,443 --> 00:58:25,432
Bob.

865
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:29,408
Anyway, thank you.

866
00:58:30,182 --> 00:58:33,242
You're a good friend,
but I'll kick your ass in November.

867
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:34,875
I wouldn't bet on that.

868
00:58:34,954 --> 00:58:36,751
I would bet on it if...

869
00:58:43,963 --> 00:58:45,191
Look at that.

870
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:51,230
They were there all the time.
Funny. Thank you.

871
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:09,911
<i>Don't feel bad. She didn't appreciate you.</i>

872
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:15,086
It's a behind-the-scenes kind of thing:
<i>Handling of a Candidate.</i>

873
00:59:15,728 --> 00:59:20,290
I'll be with the campaign 24 hours a day
from now to the election. isn't that great?

874
00:59:20,366 --> 00:59:22,061
But we were going be together.

875
00:59:22,268 --> 00:59:26,102
Yes. I'm doing it on your campaign.
I'm doing it on you!

876
00:59:26,272 --> 00:59:27,933
What do you think, Press Secretary?

877
00:59:28,174 --> 00:59:30,165
I'll see if I can get it cleared.

878
00:59:30,709 --> 00:59:32,973
- Want a little more?
- Yeah, thanks.

879
00:59:41,754 --> 00:59:46,316
Bob, let's say you'd been married a year.
Your wife comes to you and says:

880
00:59:46,392 --> 00:59:49,088
"I met a man at a party. I slept with him.

881
00:59:49,195 --> 00:59:53,655
"I promise it'll never happen again.
I still love only you." What would you say?

882
00:59:56,068 --> 01:00:00,471
I'd say, "I love you, too.
I won't pretend it doesn't hurt me.

883
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,834
"But maybe we should get
some counseling...

884
01:00:03,909 --> 01:00:06,275
"...and try to put the whole thing
behind us."

885
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,008
But you'd forgive her?

886
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:12,642
Yeah. I'd have to forgive her. Okay?

887
01:00:12,952 --> 01:00:14,283
Yeah, sure.

888
01:00:16,422 --> 01:00:19,585
<i>You can't be selfish</i>
<i>and be a friend at the same time.</i>

889
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:23,128
<i>Friendship is about self-sacrifice.</i>

890
01:00:23,863 --> 01:00:26,696
<i>And sacrifice is a two-way street. Like us.</i>

891
01:00:26,765 --> 01:00:28,096
"You see, Timmy..."

892
01:00:30,269 --> 01:00:31,930
What? Timmy?

893
01:00:33,873 --> 01:00:35,067
Honey, who's Timmy?

894
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:03,732
What's another word for "misconstrued"?

895
01:01:03,969 --> 01:01:05,834
What's the context?

896
01:01:08,641 --> 01:01:12,270
"My position on education has been
misconstrued by my opponent."

897
01:01:12,978 --> 01:01:14,309
"Distorted."

898
01:01:14,813 --> 01:01:17,782
<i>Thanks. I knew you wouldn't be sleeping.</i>

899
01:01:19,618 --> 01:01:21,017
<i>Do you have a minute to talk?</i>

900
01:01:24,356 --> 01:01:26,881
I was just finishing a letter to your mom.

901
01:01:26,959 --> 01:01:28,893
<i>- Say hi for me.</i>
- Sure will.

902
01:01:30,429 --> 01:01:31,521
Can we meet?

903
01:01:31,597 --> 01:01:33,189
Yeah. Sure.

904
01:01:33,666 --> 01:01:36,294
Let's meet in about 20 minutes.

905
01:01:37,503 --> 01:01:41,337
So how are you doing? You and Bob?

906
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:43,034
Notice I didn't say "Baja Bob."

907
01:01:43,108 --> 01:01:44,439
Thanks.

908
01:01:46,645 --> 01:01:48,579
Great. He's great.

909
01:01:49,481 --> 01:01:53,349
Good. Great in what way?
It's for your mom's letter.

910
01:01:55,321 --> 01:01:57,687
You know. Generous.

911
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:01,590
He fills my room with roses.
Stuff like that.

912
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:06,364
In fact,
the thing I needed to talk to you about...

913
01:02:10,703 --> 01:02:13,194
You see, I'm not sure...

914
01:02:13,672 --> 01:02:16,835
...that we shouldn't
not see each other anymore.

915
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:25,640
You're not sure we should,
or you're sure that we shouldn't?

916
01:02:27,252 --> 01:02:28,549
I'm sure that we shouldn't.

917
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,178
- See each other.
- Right.

918
01:02:32,257 --> 01:02:33,519
Wait a minute.

919
01:02:34,693 --> 01:02:36,524
- Didn't you call me?
- Yes, right.

920
01:02:36,729 --> 01:02:41,325
I called you because I needed to tell you
that we shouldn't see each other anymore.

921
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:43,863
Did we just enter another dimension?

922
01:02:44,103 --> 01:02:48,699
Why do you keep meeting with me
to tell me you can't meet with me?

923
01:02:49,008 --> 01:02:51,306
Because it doesn't make any sense,
that's why.

924
01:02:51,377 --> 01:02:53,208
My life doesn't make any sense.

925
01:02:53,278 --> 01:02:56,179
We don't make any sense.
Nothing does. I have to go.

926
01:02:56,281 --> 01:02:58,977
Wait a minute. You just got here.

927
01:02:59,118 --> 01:03:03,782
I know, but I have to get up really early.
Bob's doing this behind-the-scenes thing...

928
01:03:04,123 --> 01:03:05,112
I know.

929
01:03:05,224 --> 01:03:06,782
...on the campaign and me.

930
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:09,786
What?

931
01:03:10,262 --> 01:03:14,756
<i>The Days and Nights of a Press</i>
<i>Secretary.</i> Right through till the election.

932
01:03:16,635 --> 01:03:19,695
<i>- The Handling of a Candidate?</i>
- Something like that.

933
01:03:19,972 --> 01:03:23,931
We'll be spending a lot of time together
and with his crew around...

934
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,443
Anyway, I'm engaged, okay?

935
01:03:26,512 --> 01:03:29,447
And yes, it is a trial engagement,
I'll give you that.

936
01:03:29,515 --> 01:03:32,450
But still,
I'm not being fair to Bob if I'm here.

937
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:34,383
You're going to say, "But we're friends."

938
01:03:34,453 --> 01:03:37,911
And friendship is in every relationship.
I mean, is Bob my friend?

939
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:40,220
I don't know. What I'm trying to say is...

940
01:03:46,665 --> 01:03:48,155
...I have to go.

941
01:04:35,647 --> 01:04:37,911
Good evening. I'm Jim Rodriguez.

942
01:04:37,983 --> 01:04:41,316
In a campaign with more debate
behind the scenes than in front...

943
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:45,720
...it finally comes down to two men.
Although polls have Wannamaker ahead...

944
01:04:45,791 --> 01:04:49,955
...many experts believe that Garvin can
only win tonight with a clear knockout.

945
01:04:52,197 --> 01:04:53,357
"The white bull."

946
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:55,764
That's what Hemingway called
the blank page.

947
01:04:55,868 --> 01:04:59,201
Every day the writer must look that bull
right between the eyes.

948
01:04:59,505 --> 01:05:01,700
With those dreaded words still looming:

949
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:05,567
"Deadline. Deadline. Deadline."

950
01:05:09,214 --> 01:05:10,613
Good, like that. That's great.

951
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:20,357
Ten tiny tots on the train tracks.

952
01:05:22,427 --> 01:05:24,622
Got to keep the tongue loose.

953
01:05:24,863 --> 01:05:28,731
Guys, let's get a close-up on the screen.
Show how she's doing.

954
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:31,260
Sweetheart, you've got a long way to go.

955
01:05:31,503 --> 01:05:33,664
Something's been distracting you.

956
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,102
I'm not distracted.

957
01:05:35,174 --> 01:05:36,698
Yes, and it's costing us.

958
01:05:36,775 --> 01:05:39,608
Ever since the bear,
they've been getting the better of you.

959
01:05:39,678 --> 01:05:40,940
Who has?

960
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:42,645
Wannamaker.

961
01:05:43,115 --> 01:05:46,107
I need that script
for the <i>Chuck and Eddie</i> infomercial.

962
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,193
- Jules! You all right?
- Sorry, Julia.

963
01:06:05,237 --> 01:06:07,171
- Sweetheart?
- I'm fine.

964
01:06:07,306 --> 01:06:09,035
I'm gonna get some ice.

965
01:06:09,374 --> 01:06:13,811
With the debate now only moments away,
now the fight with nerves begins.

966
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:18,806
Like Grenada, 1983, with the Airborne
Division waiting for the night drop.

967
01:06:19,651 --> 01:06:20,811
Good. Cut.

968
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:24,845
Shoot. No, I got to get her the...

969
01:06:25,691 --> 01:06:26,680
Hello?

970
01:06:27,326 --> 01:06:28,486
One minute!

971
01:06:30,729 --> 01:06:31,718
Hello?

972
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,295
Anybody home? Hey, Jules?

973
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,859
Jules, I got a great idea.

974
01:06:39,071 --> 01:06:40,902
I've been meaning to run this by you.

975
01:06:41,974 --> 01:06:43,999
Bob, I'm a little busy right now.

976
01:06:44,176 --> 01:06:47,668
What if we put a camera on your head?
That way, we'd get your POV.

977
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:51,679
What do you think?
We got to get you suited up.

978
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:54,844
I'm not walking around
with a camera mounted on my head.

979
01:06:55,087 --> 01:06:57,351
Why not? "Julie-cam." it's perfect.

980
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:01,288
Ls something wrong?
Something's wrong, isn't it?

981
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,349
Yes.

982
01:07:02,761 --> 01:07:03,853
What?

983
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:07,489
I can't do this.

984
01:07:07,866 --> 01:07:09,493
The camera's not that heavy.

985
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:12,731
It's lightweight,
it's got fiber optics, remote control...

986
01:07:14,339 --> 01:07:15,397
Shit.

987
01:07:17,976 --> 01:07:19,034
Is it Timmy?

988
01:07:44,369 --> 01:07:45,927
Kevin, this is not a good time.

989
01:07:46,004 --> 01:07:50,168
I know, but listen.
What's on your eye? Is that a hickey?

990
01:07:50,642 --> 01:07:51,802
Yes, it's a hickey.

991
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,934
Wait a minute. Julia.

992
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,671
I have only one thing to say to you.

993
01:07:57,382 --> 01:07:58,679
You can't marry Freed.

994
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:01,278
Why?

995
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,646
Why?

996
01:08:03,188 --> 01:08:05,713
All right,
I didn't expect you to ask me that.

997
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:07,482
Wait a minute!

998
01:08:10,262 --> 01:08:12,127
- How many minutes?
- Four.

999
01:08:12,197 --> 01:08:13,789
Julia, listen.

1000
01:08:17,169 --> 01:08:19,000
You can't marry Freed. Ask me why.

1001
01:08:20,939 --> 01:08:22,099
Why?

1002
01:08:22,841 --> 01:08:24,172
Because...

1003
01:08:27,612 --> 01:08:28,772
...Julia...

1004
01:08:30,382 --> 01:08:32,407
...every day I don't see you...

1005
01:08:33,652 --> 01:08:35,483
...is painful to me.

1006
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:41,648
Every day I can't press my lips
against yours...

1007
01:08:47,899 --> 01:08:50,129
...I feel like I'm going to die.

1008
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:57,035
Better?

1009
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,670
Yeah.

1010
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:04,842
Please...

1011
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:06,844
...I really need to do this.

1012
01:09:06,918 --> 01:09:09,910
This is so crazy. We're going to get fired.

1013
01:09:10,088 --> 01:09:11,248
Dan! Hi!

1014
01:09:13,658 --> 01:09:15,057
- Let me see.
- Ls it gone?

1015
01:09:15,127 --> 01:09:17,789
Got it. She had a little spinach there.

1016
01:09:19,064 --> 01:09:22,693
- Julia, drink a toast to Teddy for me.
- Thank you.

1017
01:09:22,768 --> 01:09:24,998
- Hi! Kevin, isn't it?
- Yes, that's right.

1018
01:09:25,137 --> 01:09:27,128
- Sitcom writer.
- Exactly.

1019
01:09:27,606 --> 01:09:30,131
Julia, I've been thinking about you running.

1020
01:09:30,308 --> 01:09:33,175
- Kevin, you were just heading off?
- I've got to get going.

1021
01:09:33,245 --> 01:09:36,476
No, don't leave.
Watch the debate from here.

1022
01:09:36,681 --> 01:09:41,209
There's a little Congressional seat
up in Rhode island, heavy female numbers.

1023
01:09:41,286 --> 01:09:43,550
Three minutes!

1024
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:45,553
We'll talk about it at the victory party.

1025
01:09:45,624 --> 01:09:47,922
Julia, we have to talk about this.

1026
01:09:47,993 --> 01:09:50,325
Bob Freed. Have you met Kevin?

1027
01:09:50,695 --> 01:09:52,856
- Yeah. We were drinking buddies.
- Yeah.

1028
01:09:52,931 --> 01:09:54,159
- Since when?
- Kind of.

1029
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:58,396
Heard about the behind-the-scenes thing,
Baggie. Great idea.

1030
01:09:58,637 --> 01:10:00,832
That was before Timmy.

1031
01:10:03,008 --> 01:10:05,169
Anyway, Jules is like you. She writes for...

1032
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:07,074
Whoever pays the most!

1033
01:10:10,282 --> 01:10:12,443
What are you working on now, Kevin?

1034
01:10:12,551 --> 01:10:14,280
Good, everyone's here.

1035
01:10:14,352 --> 01:10:16,183
Okay. Everybody ready?

1036
01:10:16,488 --> 01:10:18,547
Kevin was just telling us about his latest.

1037
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:21,518
He's a good writer. it's shaping up great.

1038
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:23,491
- You've read it?
- Of course.

1039
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:27,326
Yeah. I show everything I write to Lee.

1040
01:10:27,866 --> 01:10:28,992
What's it called?

1041
01:10:29,734 --> 01:10:32,396
What's it called? <i>Health Care Reform...</i>

1042
01:10:33,138 --> 01:10:35,333
<i>...Show. The Health Care Reform Show.</i>

1043
01:10:35,507 --> 01:10:36,838
Ten seconds!

1044
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:39,069
What is it? Comedy? Drama?

1045
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:42,208
It's a little of both.
We have Florence Henderson lined up...

1046
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:46,383
Dan, now is no time
to play partisan politics.

1047
01:10:49,187 --> 01:10:50,176
Look!

1048
01:10:53,492 --> 01:10:57,428
<i>Good evening, and welcome</i>
<i>to the New Mexico Senatorial Debate.</i>

1049
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:01,129
<i>I'm Ian Campbell,</i>
<i>and I'll be your moderator.</i>

1050
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,727
<i>Tonight will be your one chance...</i>

1051
01:11:03,802 --> 01:11:06,202
<i>...to examine the men</i>
<i>who hope to represent you...</i>

1052
01:11:06,271 --> 01:11:09,001
<i>...for the next six years</i>

1053
01:11:09,541 --> 01:11:13,944
<i>It is an important decision,</i>
<i>and one we hope you will take seriously.</i>

1054
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:22,149
God, you smell great.

1055
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:30,791
Let's get out of here.

1056
01:11:32,197 --> 01:11:33,289
Yeah.

1057
01:11:33,999 --> 01:11:35,933
Can I meet you outside?

1058
01:11:37,903 --> 01:11:39,370
You go first.

1059
01:11:46,244 --> 01:11:48,735
Kevin, where are you going?

1060
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,112
You know what?
I think I hear my car alarm out there.

1061
01:11:53,585 --> 01:11:55,314
Ls that what that sound is?

1062
01:12:02,327 --> 01:12:05,023
You know, I have to just go call my mom...

1063
01:12:05,096 --> 01:12:09,931
...to take her pills.
She falls down if she doesn't take them.

1064
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,599
The not-falling-down pills.

1065
01:12:20,512 --> 01:12:21,843
Let's get out of here.

1066
01:12:45,503 --> 01:12:46,561
Come here.

1067
01:12:47,472 --> 01:12:49,463
I'm so glad to be out of there.

1068
01:12:51,142 --> 01:12:54,134
By the way, I'm not marrying Bob.

1069
01:12:57,649 --> 01:12:59,310
- You're not?
- No.

1070
01:13:04,823 --> 01:13:06,154
Good choice.

1071
01:13:15,133 --> 01:13:17,624
<i>America cannot be seduced.</i>

1072
01:13:24,242 --> 01:13:25,800
What's going on?

1073
01:13:29,714 --> 01:13:31,306
My money's on Garvin.

1074
01:13:31,549 --> 01:13:33,483
Has Wannamaker lost some weight?

1075
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:51,124
<i>Tarzan. Jane.</i>

1076
01:13:51,202 --> 01:13:53,432
<i>Tarzan, Jane. Tarzan, Jane.</i>

1077
01:14:00,011 --> 01:14:01,000
What?

1078
01:14:02,213 --> 01:14:05,080
Yeah. Those were my serial-killer years.

1079
01:14:08,153 --> 01:14:09,882
- Did you just snort?
- No.

1080
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:12,585
Yes, you did.
You laughed and then you snorted.

1081
01:14:17,062 --> 01:14:19,030
There you go again. You're snort-laughing.

1082
01:14:19,097 --> 01:14:23,124
It's a common thing.
You could have used a snort-laugh here.

1083
01:14:23,201 --> 01:14:24,225
Such a bad attitude.

1084
01:14:25,003 --> 01:14:26,903
I hate when people say, "Smile!"

1085
01:14:27,605 --> 01:14:28,594
I guess so.

1086
01:14:28,673 --> 01:14:30,004
Hey, isn't this...

1087
01:14:30,442 --> 01:14:32,706
That's my ex-wife.
What's that doing in there?

1088
01:14:32,777 --> 01:14:35,268
You're kidding! You and Annette?

1089
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:38,008
I know.
There's no explanation for some things.

1090
01:14:38,316 --> 01:14:42,753
I don't understand it either.
Probably a lot like you and Bob.

1091
01:14:45,757 --> 01:14:49,784
So what finally happened there?
What ended it this time?

1092
01:14:50,628 --> 01:14:53,563
It was that behind-the-scenes thing
that killed it.

1093
01:14:54,065 --> 01:14:55,225
Really?

1094
01:14:58,069 --> 01:15:01,061
- That's too bad.
- At least say it like you mean it.

1095
01:15:01,239 --> 01:15:03,571
Okay. Let me try it.

1096
01:15:04,776 --> 01:15:06,869
Well, that's too bad. How's that?

1097
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:13,582
You've been married a year.
Your wife comes to you and says:

1098
01:15:13,651 --> 01:15:15,084
- Is this a test?
- Yes.

1099
01:15:15,153 --> 01:15:17,417
"I met a man at a party. I slept with him.

1100
01:15:17,489 --> 01:15:21,255
"I promise it'll never happen again,
and I still love only you."

1101
01:15:21,326 --> 01:15:22,486
What would you do?

1102
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:26,155
I'd take her to a really romantic spot...

1103
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:30,429
...like a mountaintop, or a real
pretty bridge, or something like that...

1104
01:15:30,502 --> 01:15:32,163
...and I'd push her off.

1105
01:15:33,171 --> 01:15:34,695
- You wouldn't forgive her.
- No.

1106
01:15:34,906 --> 01:15:36,897
Well, maybe after the funeral.

1107
01:15:38,109 --> 01:15:39,736
What would you do?

1108
01:15:40,445 --> 01:15:41,537
Same thing.

1109
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,511
My kind of girl.

1110
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:47,950
Shall we speak
the unspoken language of love?

1111
01:15:48,153 --> 01:15:51,611
- You mean the kind only dogs can hear?
- Yes. The very same.

1112
01:16:17,415 --> 01:16:18,473
Kevin, open up!

1113
01:16:20,318 --> 01:16:22,183
Wake up, sleepyhead!

1114
01:16:30,061 --> 01:16:33,053
Kevin? Garvin is panicked.

1115
01:16:33,331 --> 01:16:36,027
Chuck and Eddie are already here
for this infomercial...

1116
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:38,000
...and the script you wrote us is shit!

1117
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:44,964
There are the research materials.

1118
01:16:45,276 --> 01:16:48,803
Fax a new script to Garvin by 6:00 a.m.
or you're fired!

1119
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:51,471
Election's a week away.
I'm getting pretty tired...

1120
01:16:51,549 --> 01:16:54,780
...of you paying more attention
to your reporter than to your job!

1121
01:16:57,222 --> 01:16:58,450
Kevin!

1122
01:16:58,523 --> 01:17:00,718
Wake up. Come on.

1123
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:04,192
You've got to. Kevin, wake up, okay?

1124
01:17:04,896 --> 01:17:07,990
We have to write this thing, come on.
Are you awake?

1125
01:17:11,736 --> 01:17:13,169
There you go.

1126
01:17:14,138 --> 01:17:15,969
All right. Come on.

1127
01:17:16,441 --> 01:17:19,342
You really can't handle champagne,
can you?

1128
01:17:27,151 --> 01:17:29,642
Okay. Here we go. Right up here.

1129
01:17:29,954 --> 01:17:32,286
Come on, Kevin. Let's go.

1130
01:17:38,263 --> 01:17:40,424
Here we go. All right.

1131
01:17:40,632 --> 01:17:44,534
Jeez, Kevin,
when you sleep, you really do sleep.

1132
01:17:51,376 --> 01:17:54,868
Kevin, cut it out, come on!
We don't have time for games.

1133
01:17:57,382 --> 01:18:01,614
Here we go. Now, where's the script?

1134
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,551
Here. Wait here.

1135
01:18:09,794 --> 01:18:11,125
Is it in here?

1136
01:18:24,943 --> 01:18:28,140
I got it. Okay, here it is.

1137
01:18:28,413 --> 01:18:29,607
"Infomercial."

1138
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:36,412
Hold yourself up here just for a second.

1139
01:18:36,487 --> 01:18:40,218
Let's get some light.
Hang on, all right. Now...

1140
01:18:41,526 --> 01:18:44,825
You dictate and I'll write, okay?
What would Ray Garvin say?

1141
01:18:45,964 --> 01:18:47,955
Let me tell you about...

1142
01:18:48,833 --> 01:18:51,563
Go ahead. "Let me tell you..."

1143
01:18:53,871 --> 01:18:56,772
Are you okay?
Let me tell you about what?

1144
01:18:57,742 --> 01:19:00,836
Myself? My life? My prostate?

1145
01:19:04,148 --> 01:19:06,548
"Let me tell you about my family.

1146
01:19:07,285 --> 01:19:09,253
"During this long campaign..."

1147
01:19:09,454 --> 01:19:12,617
...I haven't had a chance
to just sit and talk.

1148
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:17,284
So I wanted to invite you into my home,
where I can sort of let my hair down.

1149
01:19:18,596 --> 01:19:23,158
I hope you don't mind.
I never miss making my kids' lunches.

1150
01:19:23,568 --> 01:19:25,763
Rusty? Spot?

1151
01:19:26,104 --> 01:19:29,005
Hey, Ruffles!

1152
01:19:31,175 --> 01:19:33,268
This is great. You're gonna love this.

1153
01:19:33,678 --> 01:19:35,407
I'll show you later.

1154
01:19:39,083 --> 01:19:40,744
It's Chuck and Eddie!

1155
01:20:38,843 --> 01:20:40,003
Julia?

1156
01:20:43,781 --> 01:20:45,908
- Hey, Shakespeare!
- Hi, guys.

1157
01:20:45,983 --> 01:20:48,747
- Good stuff.
- Best thing you've ever written.

1158
01:20:48,853 --> 01:20:50,445
Thanks.

1159
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:53,748
- Let's get together.
- Yeah.

1160
01:20:55,159 --> 01:20:56,649
How's it going?

1161
01:20:57,595 --> 01:20:58,755
Home run.

1162
01:20:59,597 --> 01:21:02,361
<i>One of the reasons both of you</i>
<i>are out of work...</i>

1163
01:21:02,633 --> 01:21:05,101
<i>Between employment opportunities.</i>

1164
01:21:05,369 --> 01:21:08,395
<i>...Is because of policies</i>
<i>like those of my opponent.</i>

1165
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:12,432
<i>For example,</i>
<i>if you give one of those eggs back to me...</i>

1166
01:21:12,777 --> 01:21:16,611
<i>...that's one less egg for investment.</i>
<i>Ruffles!</i>

1167
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:22,213
You really saved my ass on this thing.
Thanks.

1168

1169
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:37,895

<i>say many campaign experts.</i>

1178
01:21:58,322 --> 01:22:01,689
Have we got the documentation yet
on the Proctor stuff?

1179
01:22:02,593 --> 01:22:04,891
It could blow up in our faces.

1180
01:22:05,763 --> 01:22:07,253
Put it out there.

1181
01:22:11,502 --> 01:22:14,335
Okay. Time to play hardball.

1182
01:22:14,839 --> 01:22:17,467
- Can we first...
- I don't want to hear it. Get going.

1183
01:22:44,635 --> 01:22:46,034
Julia Mann, please.

1184
01:22:46,971 --> 01:22:49,132
You're nothing but a horse's ass!

1185
01:22:58,216 --> 01:22:59,478
Hello?

1186
01:23:03,054 --> 01:23:04,385
What's going on?

1187
01:23:04,555 --> 01:23:05,613
Come on in.

1188
01:23:06,657 --> 01:23:11,594
I just got off the phone with a reporter
who is going to run a story tonight...

1189
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:14,125
...from an unnamed source...

1190
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:18,931
...claiming that Ray Garvin accepted
a $400,000 bribe...

1191
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:21,470
...from junk-bond king Alan Proctor.

1192
01:23:21,906 --> 01:23:23,305
My God!

1193
01:23:23,641 --> 01:23:27,133
Thus effectively ending our campaign.

1194
01:23:28,446 --> 01:23:32,940
Someone turned our finance red file
over to the press.

1195
01:23:34,018 --> 01:23:37,681
I'd just like to know
why in the hell you did it, Annette.

1196
01:23:39,523 --> 01:23:40,956
You're kidding, right?

1197
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:42,548
I wish I was.

1198
01:23:44,228 --> 01:23:45,525
You're serious?

1199
01:23:46,764 --> 01:23:48,322
I don't believe this.

1200
01:23:48,699 --> 01:23:52,658
You have some gall accusing me, Lee.
This campaign has been my life.

1201
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:56,670
You can take your finance red file
and shove it up your ass!

1202
01:23:56,807 --> 01:23:59,071
- Good-bye.
- Why would Annette do that?

1203
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:01,804
Only three people knew enough
to be this unnamed source.

1204
01:24:01,879 --> 01:24:05,212
Proctor, Garvin,
and whoever gave the files over.

1205
01:24:05,383 --> 01:24:07,908
I ruled out Garvin and Proctor.

1206
01:24:08,052 --> 01:24:10,145
- Which reporter called?
- Lt doesn't matter.

1207
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:11,812
I need to know.

1208
01:24:12,023 --> 01:24:13,354
Bob Freed.

1209
01:24:16,961 --> 01:24:18,929
Ls Kevin Vallick there?

1210
01:24:23,567 --> 01:24:24,898
That's all right. Thanks.

1211
01:24:32,243 --> 01:24:34,973
You're amazing, Julia.
You know, I thought I was good.

1212
01:24:35,913 --> 01:24:39,178
Yeah, God forbid I endanger
your position in the campaign!

1213
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:40,807
Where are you going?

1214
01:24:40,885 --> 01:24:44,218
You're upset about something.
I'm going to a more appropriate place.

1215
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:46,051
Where? A firing range?

1216
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,455
Okay, go ahead. What's on your mind?

1217
01:24:51,529 --> 01:24:54,123
Your little Proctor leak. Nice work, Julia.

1218
01:24:54,231 --> 01:24:57,496
Newsflash: campaigns play hardball.
If you can't take competition...

1219
01:24:57,568 --> 01:25:01,664
No, I can take the competition.
It's the backstabbing that's the real drag.

1220
01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:03,969
I keep you from getting fired, and...

1221
01:25:04,041 --> 01:25:07,135
You keep me from getting fired?

1222
01:25:07,445 --> 01:25:10,812
What I did the other night was a sacrifice.
I didn't have to do that.

1223
01:25:11,048 --> 01:25:12,982
Really? Thanks.

1224
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:15,746
I didn't know sleeping with me
was such a burden.

1225
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:18,050
- That's not what I meant.
- I should have known.

1226
01:25:18,389 --> 01:25:20,516
I don't know why I don't realize this.

1227
01:25:20,891 --> 01:25:24,657
I'm such a jerk.
Politics and love never mix. Never.

1228
01:25:27,264 --> 01:25:28,959
You know what, Julia?

1229
01:25:30,968 --> 01:25:32,799
From the moment I saw you...

1230
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:34,862
...I should have just run.

1231
01:25:37,208 --> 01:25:38,368
Then run.

1232
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:07,167
Mr. Vallick?

1233
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:13,873
Proctor bribes Garvin.

1234
01:26:14,645 --> 01:26:17,876
Wannamaker goes to the press
with the bribe story.

1235
01:26:18,549 --> 01:26:22,383
Garvin is ruined. Right?
All very convenient.

1236
01:26:23,254 --> 01:26:27,657
The question is,
who gave the information to Wannamaker?

1237
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:30,250
I already know who gave the information.

1238
01:26:30,327 --> 01:26:31,385
Proctor.

1239
01:26:33,898 --> 01:26:35,798
Why would Proctor do this?

1240
01:26:35,866 --> 01:26:40,462
He bribed both candidates.
He kept them both in his pocket.

1241
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:45,197
He decided he wants Wannamaker to win,
so he's destroying Garvin.

1242
01:26:48,446 --> 01:26:50,277
I want him to lose.

1243
01:26:50,748 --> 01:26:54,081
And I want Garvin to hire me
when you win.

1244
01:28:07,224 --> 01:28:11,718
<i>I would like to introduce</i>
<i>New Mexico's newest Senator!</i>

1245
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:34,177
- Hi.
- Hi.

1246
01:28:37,121 --> 01:28:38,383
I was just leaving.

1247
01:28:38,489 --> 01:28:39,979
Yeah, I saw your car.

1248
01:28:41,292 --> 01:28:42,884
I've been trying to call you.

1249
01:28:43,093 --> 01:28:45,357
I've been really busy. Sorry.

1250
01:28:48,332 --> 01:28:49,765
I stopped by the hotel.

1251
01:28:49,833 --> 01:28:52,199
I just haven't had a minute to myself.

1252
01:29:01,579 --> 01:29:05,743
I'm going to say this real quickly, okay?
Look, Julia...

1253
01:29:07,351 --> 01:29:09,876
I'm really sorry. I didn't know.

1254
01:29:11,622 --> 01:29:14,614
I feel like I blew it, and I...

1255
01:29:17,595 --> 01:29:19,927
This is really hard for me to say.

1256
01:29:20,297 --> 01:29:22,822
- Harder than not trusting me?
- No, I just...

1257
01:29:26,136 --> 01:29:30,903
I couldn't have done it without my staff!
Come on up here, guys! Get up here!

1258
01:29:31,342 --> 01:29:34,675
- Come on, Julia.
- He wants us up there. Come on!

1259
01:29:38,148 --> 01:29:39,638
What?

1260
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:41,577
Congratulations!

1261
01:29:57,434 --> 01:30:00,096
Get used to winning, Julia. You're next.

1262
01:30:02,139 --> 01:30:05,074
Look at him.
He'll never know how close we came.

1263
01:30:05,576 --> 01:30:07,635
- How close did we come?
- What?

1264
01:30:07,778 --> 01:30:09,143
How close did we come?

1265
01:30:09,213 --> 01:30:12,080
You sure you don't want
to be kept in the dark on this?

1266
01:30:12,149 --> 01:30:14,879
Wannamaker took money
from Proctor, too.

1267
01:30:16,086 --> 01:30:18,919
Fortunately,
Proctor wanted our guy to win.

1268
01:30:33,103 --> 01:30:34,764
Have a nice evening, sir.

1269
01:30:44,181 --> 01:30:45,842
What am I doing?

1270
01:31:00,731 --> 01:31:05,395
I also want to give a special thanks
to my Press Secretary...

1271
01:31:05,736 --> 01:31:08,034
...a real trooper, Miss Julia Mann!

1272
01:31:10,941 --> 01:31:14,843
Come on out here, Julia.
Take a bow. Come on.

1273
01:31:15,579 --> 01:31:17,604
She's a little shy, folks.

1274
01:31:34,465 --> 01:31:36,126
<i>Pardon me. Julia?</i>

1275
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:37,889
Kevin?

1276
01:31:39,770 --> 01:31:41,761
<i>Can I talk to you for a second?</i>

1277
01:31:42,873 --> 01:31:44,363
Where the hell are you?

1278
01:31:44,441 --> 01:31:49,310
<i>Up here in the balcony.</i>
<i>A little to your left. Right here.</i>

1279
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:58,650
Get rid of that guy! What the hell is this?
I've got a speech to finish.

1280
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:02,214
I know all about Proctor, so stuff it.
You're already finished.

1281
01:32:03,527 --> 01:32:06,428
<i>Go ahead, Kevin.</i>
<i>You have something to say?</i>

1282
01:32:06,764 --> 01:32:07,753
<i>Here?</i>

1283
01:32:10,534 --> 01:32:11,523
<i>Look.</i>

1284
01:32:12,636 --> 01:32:16,595
<i>I just think maybe there's</i>
<i>this tiny possibility that...</i>

1285
01:32:16,874 --> 01:32:18,865
<i>...maybe we...</i>

1286
01:32:20,110 --> 01:32:21,702
<i>We make sense.</i>

1287
01:32:23,313 --> 01:32:26,578
<i>Well, we did sleep together,</i>
<i>I'll give you that.</i>

1288
01:32:27,785 --> 01:32:32,779
<i>No, I mean we actually slept.</i>
<i>I haven't slept like that for a long time.</i>

1289
01:32:33,957 --> 01:32:35,288
Unlock the door!

1290
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:38,186
<i>Look, Julia, let's face it.</i>

1291
01:32:39,263 --> 01:32:41,094
<i>We belong together.</i>

1292
01:32:43,233 --> 01:32:44,393
<i>Why?</i>

1293
01:32:49,072 --> 01:32:52,064
<i>God, I'm a writer.</i>
<i>I should be prepared for this stuff.</i>

1294
01:32:52,643 --> 01:32:55,111
<i>Because after all we've been through,</i>
<i>Julia...</i>

1295
01:32:55,179 --> 01:32:57,841
<i>I mean, look at us.</i>
<i>We're still here, aren't we?</i>

1296
01:32:58,115 --> 01:32:59,776
<i>We're still together...</i>

1297
01:33:01,018 --> 01:33:02,110
<i>...kind of.</i>

1298
01:33:02,519 --> 01:33:05,682
<i>That's it?</i>
<i>You can't do any better than that?</i>

1299
01:33:13,096 --> 01:33:14,222
Push it!

1300
01:33:15,232 --> 01:33:16,961
Unlock the door, sir!

1301
01:33:17,234 --> 01:33:18,565
<i>Wait right there.</i>

1302
01:33:22,739 --> 01:33:23,728
No, Kevin!

1303
01:33:28,312 --> 01:33:31,679
Shit.

1304
01:33:41,959 --> 01:33:43,051
Tarzan!

1305
01:33:43,627 --> 01:33:44,685
Jane!

1306
01:33:49,967 --> 01:33:50,956
I love you, Julia.

1307
01:33:51,768 --> 01:33:53,167
I love you, Kevin.

1308
01:33:54,605 --> 01:33:56,971
What did the lip tattoo say?

1309
01:33:57,341 --> 01:33:58,399
Kiss me.

1310
01:33:58,742 --> 01:34:01,711
"Kiss me"? Nah. You're making that up.

1311
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:25,630
<i>Turning now to other key races</i>
<i>around the country.</i>

1312
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:29,066
<i>Rhode Island may end up</i>
<i>looking like a combat zone...</i>

1313
01:34:29,206 --> 01:34:32,642
<i>...since relative unknown Julia Mann</i>
<i>announced her candidacy today...</i>

1314
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:34,768
<i>...in the heated Congressional battle.</i>

1315
01:34:34,845 --> 01:34:37,871
<i>This campaign,</i>
<i>which many believe is a long shot...</i>

1316
01:34:37,948 --> 01:34:41,645
<i>...was defended by campaign manager</i>
<i>Kevin Vallick as...</i>

1317
01:34:42,019 --> 01:34:43,452
Julia and Kevin?

1318
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,351
I give them six months.

1319
01:34:45,789 --> 01:34:46,949
A year.

1320
01:34:48,425 --> 01:34:50,256
Happily ever after.
