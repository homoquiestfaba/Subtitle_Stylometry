00:08:27,865 --> 00:08:29,531
Okay, I'm done.

171
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:30,534
<i>Thank you.</i>

172
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:35,203
I think I was better
when you were working.

173
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:36,906
I got nervous when you stopped.

174
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:38,742
<i>More, more nervous.</i>

175
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:40,945
Well, I'll never stop.

176
00:08:43,446 --> 00:08:44,679
<i>Alright, listen,
I think we should start</i>

177
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:46,681
<i>with "Big Cheeseburgers
And Good French Fries"</i>

178
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:48,349
- "Let Me Ride In Your Big Cadillac."
- No, no, no, no.

179
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:50,418
And we're doing
a ton of songs in A.

180
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,988
I think we should make sure to revert
every... every third to C or E.

181
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,423
Oh, shut up, Zee. He's just gonna
shake 'em and he's gonna roll.

182
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:58,559
- <i>And my friend had to leave town for.. For 18 years.</i>
- <i>Fuck Townes.</i>

183
00:08:58,561 --> 00:08:59,829
I hooked Blaze up
with this guy Phil.

184
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,262
He's costin'
a shit ton of money

185
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:02,730
and we only get
two hours tape.

186
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:03,866
We can't have him gettin' drunk

187
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:06,533
and reading off the back
of tampon packages.

188
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:07,802
As funny as that is.

189
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:09,536
His brother owned the rights
to all the..

190
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:11,840
No, but I mean seriously, if I
ran us off the road right now

191
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,843
and this exploded, none of these
songs would even fucking exist.

192
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,344
<i>Just drop me off at Will's.</i>

193
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:17,879
<i>"Drop me off at Will's."
Where the fuck you going?</i>

194
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:19,914
<i>...is only giving Blaze
the gig because of you.</i>

195
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,584
<i>It's like rain.</i>

196
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:25,253
Rain doesn't try and fall.

197
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:27,621
It just falls,
because it's rain.

198
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:29,858
Okay?
So, it's the same with acting.

199
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,458
- <i>Leave me alone!</i>
- You don't try and act...

200
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,027
<i>I don't need your help!</i>

201
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:34,896
- Ah.
- <i>He's got a gun!</i>

202
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:36,264
- What?
- <i>He's got a gun!</i>

203
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:37,999
He's got a gun! Run!
He's got a gun!

204
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:39,266
Fuck me!

205
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:45,541
He's got a gun, scatter!
Scatter!

206
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:50,677
<i>Who has a gun?</i>

207
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:54,648
<i>You know that skinny guy
that does the lights?</i>

208
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,418
- <i>Doug?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

209
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:01,587
He's got a uh..

210
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:04,590
...14-year-old hayseed girl
up in his room.

211
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:06,360
So me and some of the guys
went up there

212
00:10:06,362 --> 00:10:08,064
because that didn't sound
very good.

213
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:12,399
Trying to make sure everything's
on the up and up.

214
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:13,970
Turns out the fucking guy
is nuts.

215
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:17,605
I guess I should've known.
You know what they say.

216
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
No, what do they say?

217
00:10:20,642 --> 00:10:22,644
Never stand in the way
of true love.

218
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:27,515
I'm Sybil by the way.

219
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:30,552
I'm Deputy Dawg.

220
00:10:31,586 --> 00:10:32,953
No, you're not.

221
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:34,754
Deputy Dawg?

222
00:10:34,756 --> 00:10:36,058
You like Blaze better?

223
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:39,026
What's your real name?

224
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:40,894
It was Mike Fuller, but, uh

225
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:43,565
I ditched that
when I lost 150 pounds.

226
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:46,400
You lost 150 pounds?

227
00:10:46,402 --> 00:10:47,937
You wanna see my stretch marks?

228
00:10:49,437 --> 00:10:50,770
Is that your best line?

229
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:52,774
<i>Ah! Nope.</i>

230
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:57,947
My best line, "Picture cards
can't picture you."

231
00:10:59,915 --> 00:11:01,814
How'd you lose all that weight?

232
00:11:01,816 --> 00:11:02,817
Thorazine.

233
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:10,059
Where'd you get that, uh,
that limp from?

234
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:13,026
I had polio.

235
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:14,794
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

236
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:15,931
It's okay.

237
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:19,032
I was only eight months old.

238
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:20,835
I've been an oddball
ever since.

239
00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:23,668
I never could run or dance

240
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,639
or play any of
the reindeer games.

241
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:27,977
In high school..

242
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:31,044
...I was the only Jewish person

243
00:11:31,046 --> 00:11:33,947
so they used to invite me into
classes for show and tell.

244
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:39,686
Well..

245
00:11:40,854 --> 00:11:42,456
...odd ducks unite!

246
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:57,005
I'm shy. I don't know why.

247
00:11:59,107 --> 00:12:01,606
All wild things are shy.

248
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:06,878
<i>♪ River's overflowin'</i>

249
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,118
<i>♪ Down here where I am</i>

250
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:16,421
<i>♪ The rain keeps on pouring</i>

251
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:19,860
<i>♪ I can't get in to town</i>

00:12:21,162 --> 00:12:26,198
<i>♪ I guess I may start walking</i>

253
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,167
<i>♪ For the mornin'.. ♪♪</i>

254
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:30,567
<i>At his funeral, we, uh</i>

255
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:32,171
<i>we duct taped
his casket together.</i>

256
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:34,505
- <i>Yeah, we sure did. Didn't we?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

257
00:12:34,507 --> 00:12:36,841
<i>Well, he was buried with
everything he owned.</i>

258
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:38,742
Which didn't really
add up to nothing.

259
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:41,512
- No. A Reagan mask, some pigs!
- But, do you know what?

260
00:12:41,514 --> 00:12:45,418
He, uh..
This was his guitar. Right here.

261
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,617
<i>He gave it to you?</i>

262
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:49,121
I bought it for him.
I bought it for him.

263
00:12:49,123 --> 00:12:50,756
- You did?
- Yeah.

264
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,958
You see, Blaze he... he, uh..

265
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,196
...he was really popular
at the pawn shop.

266
00:12:57,198 --> 00:12:58,764
Almost famous
at the pawn shop.

267
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:02,100
He, he ended up
borrowing more guitars

268
00:13:02,102 --> 00:13:03,869
than he ever actually played.

269
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:06,637
<i>After the funeral I heard</i>

270
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,906
<i>that it might be
at this one shop</i>

271
00:13:08,908 --> 00:13:10,674
- <i>The guitar?</i>
- <i>This guitar.</i>

272
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:13,211
<i>So I went over there
and sure enough, there it was.</i>

273
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:16,114
<i>And, uh..
But, you know..</i>

274
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:18,816
<i>I told the guy, I said, "Hey, man,
that's... that's my buddy's guitar."</i>

275
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:22,320
And you know he gave it to me. He
actually willed it to me. Which he did!

276
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:24,021
<i>But he wasn't giving away
nothing.</i>

277
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:26,224
<i>He wanted 1800 bucks for it.</i>

278
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:30,794
<i>So we all knew
that Blaze only had one coat</i>

279
00:13:30,796 --> 00:13:34,732
and I was pretty sure that that
pawn slip was gonna be in that coat.

280
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:37,135
So, one night after the funeral

281
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:39,703
we got thinking about it and, uh

282
00:13:39,705 --> 00:13:41,972
drinking about it
maybe a little bit

283
00:13:41,974 --> 00:13:44,041
and me and Al Minus and, uh..

284
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:46,910
Crazy Kerkin you know,
some, I'm not really sure.

285
00:13:46,912 --> 00:13:48,511
When was this?

286
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:50,780
You weren't there, but..

287
00:13:50,782 --> 00:13:52,883
I just pretty much decided
I was gonna go over there

288
00:13:52,885 --> 00:13:54,119
and I was gonna dig him up

289
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:56,189
to get, to get that pawn slip.

290
00:13:57,822 --> 00:13:59,522
<i>And that's what I did.</i>

291
00:13:59,524 --> 00:14:01,724
<i>I went over there
and I dug him up</i>

292
00:14:01,726 --> 00:14:03,128
<i>cut through that duct tape</i>

293
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,660
<i>opened it up</i>

294
00:14:04,662 --> 00:14:06,030
<i>and sure enough, there it was.</i>

295
00:14:06,032 --> 00:14:07,399
<i>Right there
in that breast pocket.</i>

296
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:11,103
His pawn slip.

297
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:14,005
I'll tell you something else
about that.

298
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,174
When I got it open

299
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:18,610
he was grinnin'.

300
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:21,813
Like laughin'.

301
00:14:23,283 --> 00:14:24,582
So now it's my guitar.

302
00:14:28,154 --> 00:14:30,254
<i>Only one drink, big dog.
That's the limit.</i>

303
00:14:30,256 --> 00:14:32,156
<i>I don't want any shenanigans
from you tonight.</i>

304
00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:34,023
<i>No fights.
No belligerent bullshit.</i>

305
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:35,392
- <i>No, no, he's...</i>
- <i>You got it?</i>

306
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:37,627
<i>It's none for him.
He's sober. Give his to Concho.</i>

307
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:38,761
<i>Damn right!</i>

308
00:14:38,763 --> 00:14:41,864
- <i>Blaze sober? Bullshit.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

309
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:43,333
<i>He's clean as a the house too.</i>

310
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:45,668
- Where's Townes?
- Oh, he's, uh, he had to make a stop.

311
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,172
- He's right behind us. He's coming.
- Uh-huh.

312
00:14:48,174 --> 00:14:50,975
I'm breaking so many promise to
myself letting you play again.

313
00:14:52,077 --> 00:14:54,643
Don't make me regret it.

314
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:55,646
Fuck!

315
00:14:57,082 --> 00:14:58,781
What an asshole.

316
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:00,850
- Hmm.
- You good?

317
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:03,886
Sneak me a Dr. Pepper
and a squirt of amber in it.

318
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:06,124
Nah. You got this.
You got this.

319
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,098
<i>Check, check, check. Alligator,
alligator, alligator, gah.</i>

320
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,704
<i>You rollin'?</i>

321
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:23,839
<i>Okay, good people.</i>

322
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,742
<i>I've got every last dollar
in the world to me</i>

323
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:30,347
<i>spinnin' 'round those
reel to reels so you know.</i>

324
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:32,814
<i>So I'm gonna do my best
not to do too much</i>

325
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:36,320
<i>Johnny Carsonin'
or Chatty Cathyin'</i>

326
00:15:36,322 --> 00:15:41,290
<i>just gonna play every song I,
I can think of I guess.</i>

327
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:44,993
Will that mean we're gonna be
on the album if I shout a ton?

328
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:46,928
<i>Yes, I suppose it does!</i>

329
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,164
Hey, Jake, we're
gonna be on the album!

330
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,699
Welcome home!

331
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,067
<i>Fuck you!</i>

332
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:54,769
Hey! When's Townes comin'?

333
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:56,106
He's comin' when he's coming.

334
00:15:57,841 --> 00:16:00,842
Spring bird.
You know spring bird!

335
00:16:00,844 --> 00:16:04,112
Springers! You've got to know
some springers.

336
00:16:04,114 --> 00:16:07,383
Ever feel like you're not
gonna be alive much longer?

337
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:11,153
<i>Ha! With the way you live,
that's not much of a premonition.</i>

338
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:12,655
That's wishful thinkin'.

339
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:15,857
<i>Well..</i>

340
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:18,394
<i>...if I was to go up
and see the Big Spender</i>

341
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:21,297
<i>That's what I call the man
upstairs, The Big Spender.</i>

342
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:26,001
<i>'Cause he, or she,
is one generous being.</i>

343
00:16:26,003 --> 00:16:28,802
<i>You want a light? Zap!</i>

344
00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:30,373
<i>Here's a star on fire.</i>

345
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,772
<i>You like flowers?</i>

346
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:33,409
<i>Here's ten million
different kinds.</i>

347
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:36,911
<i>You want music?
Here's Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart!</i>

348
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:40,080
<i>You don't dig on the fancy
pants symphonic stuff?</i>

349
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,417
<i>Here's Merle Haggard.</i>

350
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:44,051
<i>Yeah, I suppose
if I was to check out early</i>

351
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:45,554
<i>and go and meet the Big Spender</i>

352
00:16:45,556 --> 00:16:47,855
<i>I'd be sad I never got to meet
Merle Haggard</i>

353
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:50,758
<i>never got to play
my charm song.</i>

354
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,396
<i>So, ladies and gentleman's</i>

355
00:16:53,398 --> 00:16:56,331
<i>this deal tonight,
is my letter to Merle.</i>

356
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,998
<i>Say hi to Merle, folks.</i>

357
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,101
- Hey, Merle!
- Howdy, Merle!

358
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,105
- Hey, Merle.
- Hey, Merle.

359
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,308
You know, I bet
old Merle's been in love.

360
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,176
Well, I's been in love too.

361
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:12,248
This one's called "Picture Cards
Can't Picture You."

362
00:17:13,316 --> 00:17:14,650
<i>Ain't that right?</i>

363
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,185
You see it's not
that primitive.

364
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:19,522
It's got, you know..

365
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:22,122
...running water.

366
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,159
<i>Man, we sure do appreciate
the offer.</i>

367
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,961
<i>You know, y'all can rent it
if you like.</i>

368
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,064
<i>How much you want for it?</i>

369
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:29,798
Nothin'.

370
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,300

Huh?

398
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,622
I don't wanna be a star.

399
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:37,522
I wants to be a legend.

400
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:41,427
What's the,
what's the difference, deputy?

401
00:19:42,462 --> 00:19:44,428
Well..

00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,234
...stars burn out 'cause
they shine for themselves.

00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:50,938
Look at me shine,
look at me glow.

404
00:19:51,872 --> 00:19:53,040
I'm amazing.

405
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:56,110
Legend lasts forever.

406
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,079
A legend stands for something.

407
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:02,049
Something that matters,
you know?

408
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:06,050
Well, do you think
that's possible?

409
00:20:06,052 --> 00:20:07,621
You... you could live forever?

410
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:12,659
People can't, but a song can.

411
00:20:13,627 --> 00:20:15,094
It's just a matter of time.

412
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:42,188
All of a sudden
I have no idea what to sing.

413
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:44,924
<i>You know any Neil Young?</i>

414
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:48,259
<i>When is Townes comin'?</i>

415
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:50,495
<i>Why don't you play the first
song you ever wrote?</i>

416
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:53,166
The first song I ever wrote?

417
00:20:56,568 --> 00:21:00,437
Man, I wouldn't play that song
to myself sitting in the dark.

418
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:04,110
Stupid little song about living
in a tree house in the woods.

419
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:08,445
I wrote that song for a..

420
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:11,550
...a beautiful little Jewish gal
with kinky hair.

421
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:15,121
Thought that song
would last forever.

422
00:21:30,403 --> 00:21:34,371
Just like every time,
I'm... preparing a scene

423
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:39,244
it's like... I have all
these ideas of how I wanna do it

424
00:21:40,345 --> 00:21:42,545
and then..

425
00:21:42,547 --> 00:21:44,113
...when I actually have to do it

426
00:21:44,115 --> 00:21:46,284
or if there's somebody
watching me..

427
00:21:47,552 --> 00:21:49,689
...it's not even like stage
fright, it's just like..

428
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:56,328
...the ease of it
kinda leaves my body. You know?

429
00:21:57,195 --> 00:21:59,461
- And..
- <i>Mm.</i>

430
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:00,764
After every time, it's like

431
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:02,735
it's never as good
as I know it can be.

432
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:09,038
I don't know, I guess it's just,
like, confidence or something

433
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,775
I just don't feel like I'm giving
it all the energy I actually have.

434
00:22:12,777 --> 00:22:15,678
I wanted to be, like, free and
not questioning what I'm doing

435
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,646
but I'm always questioning it.

436
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:19,550
Where do you think
confidence comes from?

437
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:23,755
<i>I don't know.
Thinking you're the best?</i>

438
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,458
That's not real confidence.

439
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,661
Can I tell you
where I think it comes from?

440
00:22:31,363 --> 00:22:32,463
<i>Mm-hm, okay.</i>

441
00:22:33,664 --> 00:22:36,266
I think confidence
is a consolation prize

442
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:37,769
for knowing that you're alive.

443
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,274
I do.

444
00:22:44,108 --> 00:22:46,475
Some years back,
you weren't even here.

445
00:22:46,477 --> 00:22:48,310
And now you're here.

446
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:50,415
- <i>Mm.</i>
- Couple years, you won't be here again.

447
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:57,087
<i>Knowin' that you're here's...
kind of a rarity as a human being.</i>

448
00:23:00,324 --> 00:23:03,327
It seems too simple
but it's true I think.

449
00:23:04,662 --> 00:23:06,128
Next time you're on stage

450
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,365
remember, you got a heart
beatin' in your chest..

451
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:12,369
...there's lungs filling up
with air.

452
00:23:14,405 --> 00:23:16,173
All that stuff is really
happenin'.

453
00:23:19,276 --> 00:23:23,544
<i>All these little melodramas
people make up for themself</i>

454
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:25,316
<i>they don't mean anything.</i>

455
00:23:27,284 --> 00:23:29,186
<i>I think that's the way it is.</i>

456
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:32,587
You have it though.
I've seen it.

457
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:33,721
<i>Yeah, as long
as you're around.</i>

458
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:35,125
That's not true.

459
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:39,129
You have it when you're walking
across the room.

460
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:43,664
And you fill other people
with it

461
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,668
because you remind them
that they're alive.

462
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:50,839
Bet you didn't know that?

463
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:51,842
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

464
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:54,711
Well, now you do.

465
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,846
Now, please discard.

466
00:23:57,848 --> 00:23:59,182
I'm ready, there!

467
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:01,716
Can I take another one?

468
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:02,818
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

469
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,386
<i>It's my turn!</i>

470
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:06,857
<i>That night,
the night he died, uh..</i>

471
00:24:07,858 --> 00:24:09,459
...we recorded a live record..

472
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,728
...at, uh..

473
00:24:14,564 --> 00:24:15,763
It was The Outhouse.

474
00:24:15,765 --> 00:24:17,833
Is Townes coming or not?

475
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:20,234
Maintain Jennifer, he's comin'.

476
00:24:20,236 --> 00:24:21,434
<i>Yo!</i>

477
00:24:21,436 --> 00:24:23,738
I often find myself thinking on

478
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,874
where does a song come from?

479
00:24:25,876 --> 00:24:27,775
A real song.
You know what I mean?

480
00:24:27,777 --> 00:24:29,609
He's told me not to come here.

481
00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:34,581
<i>'Cause the good ones, they
just sort of arrive on time.</i>

482
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,783
<i>There we go.</i>

483
00:24:36,785 --> 00:24:39,686
<i>Like, uh... where was it?</i>

484
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:43,523
<i>♪ I'm so lonesome
I could cry ♪♪♪</i>

485
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,860
Five minutes
before it was written.

486
00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:47,560
Where was it?

487
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:49,363
'Cause it's,
once it's in the air

488
00:24:49,365 --> 00:24:51,866
it's like it's
always been there.

489
00:24:51,868 --> 00:24:54,601
<i>You can't imagine the world
without that melody.</i>

490
00:24:54,603 --> 00:24:56,703
<i>It's like babies maybe.</i>

491
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:58,571
<i>Where do they come from?</i>

492
00:24:58,573 --> 00:24:59,942
Comes from love, right?

493
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:03,244
From the galaxy deep.

494
00:25:03,246 --> 00:25:06,380
All them stars,
lighting up the night sky.

495
00:25:06,382 --> 00:25:09,716
Songs are like stars
or like babies.

496
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:11,651
<i>What happens if you stop 'em?</i>

497
00:25:11,653 --> 00:25:13,853
<i>What happened to all the songs
in me that haven't come out yet</i>

498
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:15,555
<i>on account of
me not being able to live up</i>

499
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,524
<i>to who I'm supposed to be.</i>

500
00:25:17,526 --> 00:25:19,693
<i>Maybe I should
just be satisfied</i>

501
00:25:19,695 --> 00:25:22,729
with all the burnin' planets
we got.

502
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:25,233
The whole universe can't catch
on fire, can it?

503
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:28,069
Maybe it can.

504
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:30,569
<i>Maybe the Milky Way's
a gigantic record</i>

505
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,604
<i>and your life
is like the needle.</i>

506
00:25:35,844 --> 00:25:36,977
Where the hell you going?

507
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:38,577
Take a smoke break.

508
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:41,281
<i>What the fuck? Hell no.

<i>But then again..</i>

590
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,194
What is he,
Little Lord Fauntleroy?

591
00:32:06,196 --> 00:32:08,363
Maybe he's just thinkin'
who the hell is this fool

592
00:32:08,365 --> 00:32:10,331
talking on the phone
for the whole thing?

593

<i>You know, you'd never know
by lookin' at him.</i>

594
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:16,036
But he was a spiritual,
almost righteous.

595
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:19,005
I guess you could say
he took a vow of poverty

596
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:21,007
and saw everything
through that lens.

597
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:24,111
You know, I used to fish
the White River with my father.

598
00:32:24,113 --> 00:32:25,679
<i>I don't know when I'm gonna be
back. I just..</i>

599
00:32:25,681 --> 00:32:27,114
One spring I was

600
00:32:27,116 --> 00:32:29,749
fishin' with him and I said,
"Daddy, is this the same water

601
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:31,918
we was ridin' on last summer?"

602
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,254
I mean, is this water
that we're motivatin'

603
00:32:34,256 --> 00:32:37,691
on the same water... from before?

604
00:32:37,693 --> 00:32:40,227
I told you I was gonna pick some
shit up for Jim! I gotta drop it off!

605
00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:42,095
He just shook his head

606
00:32:42,097 --> 00:32:45,932
looked at me,
with some bait on his hook.

607
00:32:45,934 --> 00:32:49,169
'Cause I put 20 bucks in the damn
drawer is how you can order it!

608
00:32:49,171 --> 00:32:51,338
That's when I realized
grown folk don't know shit.

609
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,973
<i>I can't sit here and talk
all day. I've gotta go.</i>

610
00:32:52,975 --> 00:32:55,108
And nobody knows nothin'.

611
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:58,078
Least of all
this goofy son of a bitch.

612
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,146
Is he talking to me?

613
00:32:59,148 --> 00:33:00,149
Heh, probably.

614
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,183
Yeah! I'm talking to you!

615
00:33:03,185 --> 00:33:06,919
I can hear every goddamn words
you're saying on that talk bus.

616
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:10,656
How many quarters do you plan
on jamming in, Igmitus?

617
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:13,193
<i>Hey, man, I'm just waiting
for your shit music to stop.</i>

618
00:33:13,195 --> 00:33:14,793
<i>Ah, ignore this fucker, man.</i>

619
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:16,096
Shit music.

620
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:17,997
Honey, I might have
to call you back.

621
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:19,566
- Uh-huh.
- <i>Blaze.</i>

622
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:20,900
Oh, no, no, no, no.

623
00:33:20,902 --> 00:33:23,004
Why don't you bring your ass up
here, ZZ Top?

624
00:33:24,373 --> 00:33:25,738
Blaze, come on.

625
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,006
Fucking piece of shit.

626
00:33:27,008 --> 00:33:28,809
<i>One time we'd been up
for like a week..</i>

627
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,344
...writing.

628
00:33:31,346 --> 00:33:33,812
<i>I was finally trying
to fall asleep.</i>

629
00:33:33,814 --> 00:33:35,515
<i>Blaze just stumbles
into the room</i>

630
00:33:35,517 --> 00:33:37,685
and he's, like,
mumbling something.

631
00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:41,887
He, he told me
he was trying to meditate.

632
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:43,055
<i>What?</i>

633
00:33:43,057 --> 00:33:44,757
Yeah.

634
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,060
He, he just kept..

635
00:33:47,695 --> 00:33:50,462
...saying this, like, Buddhist
prayer over and over again

636
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:53,032
he was just like,
staring at the wall

637
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:54,133
What, like a mantra?

638
00:33:54,135 --> 00:33:56,001
But then all of a sudden
there was this..

639
00:33:56,003 --> 00:33:58,070
...explosion in the room.

640
00:33:58,072 --> 00:34:02,908
Like the room exploded
with this bright white light

641
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:07,479
and it felt like
something, like..

642
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:10,015
It was like somethin'
that hasn't made it

643
00:34:10,017 --> 00:34:12,418
its way into a book.

644
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:16,788
<i>And from this feeling
of genuine love</i>

645
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:20,228
this Buddha-like
character appeared.

646
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:26,332
And he went to the door
and he opened the door

647
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:30,768
and there was even a bigger
explosion of light

648
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,772
and in walks Jesus.

649
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:36,074
<i>And Jesus tells Blaze</i>

650
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:38,776
that you never turn your back
on your family.

651
00:34:38,778 --> 00:34:40,912
Did he say it that in Aramaic?

652
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:42,749
Yeah, something like that.

653
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,016
Regardless of what you worship

654
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:46,286
or how you worship..

655
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:51,389
...you can't..

656
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:53,326
You can't lose,
you can't strip away these

657
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:56,361
these symbols
that you're raised with.

658
00:34:56,363 --> 00:34:58,298
They become part of you like..

659
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:02,499
...like blood.

660
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:05,105
<i>Hell fucking no.</i>

661
00:35:06,573 --> 00:35:10,308
No, no, no, no, no.
Hell fucking no.

662
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,011
Here's what I'm saying is
Blaze didn't have to look east

663
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:14,014
to see the light.

664
00:35:16,983 --> 00:35:18,850
The light is with us.

665
00:35:18,852 --> 00:35:20,251
I think the two of you
were drinking

666
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:23,520
or something for a week,
and if I remember correctly

667
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,889
<i>you had to pull a pistol on him
to get him out of your bedroom.</i>

668
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:28,161
What I'm saying is
that, uh, he was, um..

669
00:35:31,998 --> 00:35:34,167
He was open
to that kind of experience.

670
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,969
That doesn't mean
that I think he could handle it.

671
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:42,039
Goddammit, why'd you take your hands
down to the goddamn hole in the wall.

672
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:43,408
Because they won't let you in.

673
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,876
I let you in and you come in
you asked me to come in

674
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:47,844
and goddammit
I let you in and you fuck it up!

675
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:49,146
- I'm real sorry about that.
- <i>I'm gonna tear your ass down..</i>

676
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:55,018
Look, I care for the man.
I care for him.

677
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,186
Six... six hundred.

678
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:57,821
Let's just, let us finish this.
Now, come on.

679
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:00,457
I'm just sick and fucking tired
of people getting hurt in my bar.

680
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:02,259
- Don't you understand?
- Oh, come on.

681
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:04,061
- It's over.
- Please?

682
00:36:04,063 --> 00:36:06,599
Goddammit. Son of a mother
fucking bitch.

683
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:09,902
That was embarrassing.

684
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:13,036
You alright?

685
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:14,273
I think so.

686
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,974
Okey-dokey, smoky-pokey.

687
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:20,410
This next song
is my wedding song.

688
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:24,681
If J.T.'s alright with it and
they're still not too mad at me

689
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,616
<i>I'd love to have the Outhouse family
come up here and play some music with us.</i>

690
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:31,988
Jodie, Nassie and Dave.
If y'all feel inclined.

691
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,457
Come on up here
and play this song.

692
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:37,196
<i>This song's called "Big
Cheeseburgers And Good French Fries."</i>

693
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:42,498
<i>It's not like playing up a tree
house free as a squirrel.</i>

694
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,170
<i>But looky here now, I'm just
standing here playing for Merle.</i>

695
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,071
That rhyme to.

696
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:50,639
There's a little sucker thing
going round and around.

697
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,418
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Hey!

698
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,220
- How you been?
- I'm doing good.

699
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,956
Well aren't you the cutest
fucking thing I've ever seen?

700
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,425
<i>You feel confident that they're prepared
to have a Bigfoot in their house?</i>

701
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,527
- There's nothing to worry about.
- <i>Sam!</i>

702
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,329
- <i>Sam, come on. They're here! She's here!</i>
- <i>Let's go, let's go.</i>

703
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,241
Thanks for the tea,
uh, Mrs. Rosen.

704
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,643
I wish I could
still drink coffee.

705
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,544
Coffee does wonders
for my noodle hub

706
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:32,248
but wreaks havoc
down in my spaghetti house.

707
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,484
It's just a mess, you know?

708
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:41,123
<i>Blaze, don't you think Sybil
has a nice nose?</i>

709
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:44,694
Oh, Ms. Rosen, we Pentecostals
don't go in for noses.

710
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,238
Having said that, as far as noses go,
that's one of the finest noses I knows.

711
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:01,976
So you guys been married
for a long time?

712
00:38:01,978 --> 00:38:03,414
Oh, we've been married forever.

713
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,550
<i>Y'all's got that
old-fashioned love.</i>

714
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,354
That's what I want for Tsibila.

715
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:15,457
Setsibila? What is Setsibila?

716
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:20,428
Tsi... Tsibila. It means
a little onion in Yiddish.

717
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:24,400
Little onion. So youse my little
sweet Vidalia Onion?

718
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,736
Gonna eat you for breakfast
with my hot potato.

719
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:29,537
Are you kidding me?

720
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:30,707
Ugh, Mom!

721
00:38:35,645 --> 00:38:36,646
Sorry.

722
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:42,350
Can, uh..

723
00:38:42,352 --> 00:38:45,989
...can we talk to one
another... honestly?

724
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:48,457
Yeah. That would be nice.

725
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:53,194
Sybil..

726
00:38:53,196 --> 00:38:58,632
...I think you brought this man
home to meet your family

727
00:38:58,634 --> 00:39:03,171
because... you are in love
with him

728
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:07,041
<i>and you are considering
marriage and children.</i>

729
00:39:07,043 --> 00:39:08,144
<i>Is that right?</i>

730
00:39:10,446 --> 00:39:11,447
Yeah.

731
00:39:13,749 --> 00:39:15,682
We are a Jewish family.

732
00:39:15,684 --> 00:39:17,285
<i>Yes.</i>

733
00:39:17,287 --> 00:39:21,090
If we have grandchildren,
we would want them to be Jewish.

734
00:39:22,758 --> 00:39:26,095
- I got it.
- I noticed you haven't asked for Sybil's hand.

735
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:29,231
Is that somethin' you were
planning on doing?

736
00:39:33,403 --> 00:39:36,436
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

737
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:39,172
Well, now would be a great time
for that I think.

738
00:39:39,174 --> 00:39:40,207
- <i>Now?</i>
- <i>Dad.</i>

739
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:41,341
Jeanette?

740
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:43,210
Could you come on
back in here, please?

741
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:45,112
No, no, Dad, Dad.

742
00:39:45,114 --> 00:39:47,482
Please. Let's not be ridiculous,
okay?

743
00:39:48,651 --> 00:39:52,518
If Blaze wants to marry me

744
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,123
we have to talk about it first.

745
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:57,758
Of course
I respect the past, but..

746
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,726
...the past has a lot
of ugliness to it

747
00:40:00,728 --> 00:40:04,530
that I think we're all trying
to change in the future.

748
00:40:04,532 --> 00:40:07,267
I don't want to spend my life
cleaning up some man's socks

749
00:40:07,269 --> 00:40:08,601
and I definitely don't want
to be handed out

750
00:40:08,603 --> 00:40:10,272
as if I am something
that's owned.

751
00:40:25,787 --> 00:40:30,259
If Blaze wants my hand,
he has to ask me.

752
00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:37,599
And if I say yes, then,
we will ask for your blessing.

753
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:44,303
And if you don't give it to us,
we'll do it anyway.

754
00:40:44,305 --> 00:40:49,408
But if Blaze does decide
to convert to Judaism

755
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:52,345
your mother and I, and we
haven't discussed this

756
00:40:52,347 --> 00:40:55,715
but I'm certain we agree

757
00:40:55,717 --> 00:40:59,451
if he does convert, your mother
and I will cover the costs.

758
00:40:59,453 --> 00:41:00,688
Of course, we will.

759
00:41:02,857 --> 00:41:05,660
That's good to know.
That's good to know for sure.

760
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:09,596
Blaze, is your faith important
to you?

761
00:41:10,664 --> 00:41:12,566
Is my faith important to me?

762
00:41:14,836 --> 00:41:16,869
I'm not dead positive
I know what you mean..

763
00:41:16,871 --> 00:41:19,704
Your identity as a Christian

764
00:41:19,706 --> 00:41:22,377
is that fundamental
to your integrity?

765
00:41:23,211 --> 00:41:25,378
I got ya.

766
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,215
Mr. Rosen, Christianity didn't
do much more than kick my ass

767
00:41:29,217 --> 00:41:30,584
every day including Sunday.

768
00:41:31,618 --> 00:41:33,221
<i>It taught me to sing, but, uh...</i>

769
00:41:34,554 --> 00:41:37,889
the Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away, so...

770
00:41:37,891 --> 00:41:41,526
No, not terribly important.
That would be a <i>nay.</i>

771
00:41:41,528 --> 00:41:44,232
Well, see, that's
very helpful for me to know.

772
00:41:45,632 --> 00:41:47,400
<i>Say, I got a question?</i>

773
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:49,335
Was Zero Mostel really Jewish?

774
00:41:49,337 --> 00:41:50,735
From "Fiddler On The Roof?"

775
00:41:50,737 --> 00:41:52,637
Yeah, yeah.

776
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,340
I believe so.

777
00:41:55,342 --> 00:41:57,742
In fact, I think
he was raised orthodox.

778
00:41:57,744 --> 00:41:58,745
Yeah.

779
00:41:59,913 --> 00:42:01,246
Hot dog.

780
00:42:01,248 --> 00:42:02,582

he was gettin' a divorce
I think.

813

to peddle your songs.

823
00:44:20,652 --> 00:44:21,918
Oh, yeah?

824
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,921
Yeah.

Let's not get too easy.

828
00:44:30,795 --> 00:44:33,031
Your songs are getting so good
right now, they really are.

829
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:37,467
Are you sure you're ready
to leave paradise?

830
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:41,603
I just think
you need an audience.

831
00:44:41,605 --> 00:44:44,474

your songs forever. I mean..

835
00:44:54,518 --> 00:44:56,286

Blaze is ready. Blaze.

836
00:44:56,288 --> 00:44:57,586
I is ready, man.

837
00:44:57,588 --> 00:45:00,655

839
00:45:02,426 --> 00:45:04,759
I mean, come on! Look at this
place! Open your eyes!

00:45:04,761 --> 00:45:07,462
Graceland has got
nothin' on this.

842
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:11,433
- That's probably true.
- Yeah! I know.

843
00:45:11,435 --> 00:45:15,737

I have slotted "Twelfth Night"

and "The Seagull."

845
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:18,506

851
00:45:28,585 --> 00:45:30,085
Yeah.

860

We gotta try out the real world
for a little while.

861
00:45:47,638 --> 00:45:51,605
The real world? Oh, wow.
That sounds serious.

862
00:45:51,607 --> 00:45:53,708
The real world..

863
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,143
Well..

00:45:55,145 --> 00:45:57,881

886
00:47:08,985 --> 00:47:11,684
Oh, yeah. I guess you have to.
Keeps us going.

887
00:47:11,686 --> 00:47:13,586
I didn't start drinking coffee
until I was a teenager.

888
00:47:13,588 --> 00:47:17,191
My father loved coffee almost
as much as he liked liquor.

889
00:47:17,193 --> 00:47:19,859
<i>One summer, we was painting
the side of the house.</i>

890
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:21,594
So he had me down on doing
the low bit

891
00:47:21,596 --> 00:47:24,664
he was doing the high bit.
Anyway, he fell on his face.

892
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:26,368
Broke his jaw in three places.

893
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:28,668
- Is this a true story?
- This is a true story.

894
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,537
This is a true story.
I was probably nine years old.

895
00:47:31,539 --> 00:47:33,039
And he was in the hospital
for three days

896
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:35,109
and I went to visit him
on the second day.

897
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:36,976
He was just... you know

898
00:47:36,978 --> 00:47:40,980
anxious and shaking,
and his jaw was wired shut.

899
00:47:40,982 --> 00:47:42,715
And he was, like, and I said,
"How you doing, Daddy?"

900
00:47:42,717 --> 00:47:44,117
He said "I'm doing alright,
apart from the fact

901
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:45,718
"that I need a drink
and a cup of coffee

902
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,687
"and they won't let me have
liquor inside the hospital.

903
00:47:47,689 --> 00:47:49,188
But they said
I could have coffee."

904
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:50,623
And I'm waiting
to find out how.

905
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:52,658
So the nurse came in.

906
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,993
Nurse comes in and says,
"Mr. Fuller

907
00:47:53,995 --> 00:47:55,397
"I really have to apologize
to you

908
00:47:55,399 --> 00:47:58,131
the only way we can do this
is an enema."

909
00:47:59,267 --> 00:48:00,633
<i>Oh, no.</i>

910
00:48:00,635 --> 00:48:02,735
And he said,
"I don't care what you do

911
00:48:02,737 --> 00:48:04,937
I just want you to get
my coffee."

912
00:48:04,939 --> 00:48:07,607
So I said, "Should I leave?"
He said, "No."

913
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:10,877
So she came in. She..
And I promise you, it's true..

914
00:48:10,879 --> 00:48:12,611
Turned him on his side.

915
00:48:12,613 --> 00:48:14,881
<i>And he says,
"Son, hold my hand."</i>

916
00:48:14,883 --> 00:48:16,883
I said, "Alright."

917
00:48:16,885 --> 00:48:18,951
I held his hand and he looked
at me and she said

918
00:48:18,953 --> 00:48:21,254
"I'm going to put in
the hose now, Mr. Fuller.

919
00:48:21,256 --> 00:48:22,789
Take a deep breath.
Took a deep breath."

920
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:24,190
"Oh! Shit!

921
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,859
You put the thing up
where it shouldn't be."

922
00:48:26,861 --> 00:48:28,061
<i>She rolled this thing in</i>

923
00:48:28,063 --> 00:48:30,296
they had hot coffee
up in that IV bag.

924
00:48:30,298 --> 00:48:31,730
- <i>Hot coffee?</i>
- Hot coffee..

925
00:48:31,732 --> 00:48:33,765
They just gone and pour
that thing.

926
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:35,901
And she released the valve
on that thing

927
00:48:35,903 --> 00:48:36,935
and said,
"Take a deep breath."

928
00:48:36,937 --> 00:48:39,172
He said, "Oh! Shit!

929
00:48:39,174 --> 00:48:41,740
Oh, God almighty."

930
00:48:41,742 --> 00:48:43,942
And she said, "What's the matter,
Mr. Fuller? Is it too hot?"

931
00:48:43,944 --> 00:48:46,678
And he said,
"No! It's too sweet!"

1346
01:11:00,795 --> 01:11:02,294
I've been reading Mr. Kafka

1347
01:11:02,296 --> 01:11:06,298
and I can feel his problem
in getting grace.

1348
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,200
<i>I'm talkin' around the point.</i>

1349
01:11:08,202 --> 01:11:11,603
<i>I realize you have to suffer
to learn</i>

1350
01:11:11,605 --> 01:11:14,539
but it's hard
to want to suffer.

1351
01:11:14,541 --> 01:11:16,841
We all walk around
puffing like peacocks

1352
01:11:16,843 --> 01:11:19,577
as if we made our own
feathers.

1353
01:11:19,579 --> 01:11:23,815
Cut us open, so we can see
our ego is an illusion.

1354
01:11:23,817 --> 01:11:27,051
I would very much like to
talk to you.

1355
01:11:27,053 --> 01:11:29,888
<i>Today, right now.</i>

1356
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:32,258
<i>I have proved myself
a glutton.</i>

1357
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,958
A glutton for scotch

1358
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,298
oatmeal cookies
and erotic thought.

1359
01:11:39,566 --> 01:11:42,135
Okay, that's it,
take ten, everyone.

1360
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:05,890
The next song's called,
"If I Could Only Fly."

1361
01:12:05,892 --> 01:12:09,493
But I was a selfish man
when I wrote this song.

1362
01:12:09,495 --> 01:12:12,565
I wrote it for a girl,
a woman.

1363
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,134
And, uh..

1364
01:12:16,136 --> 01:12:19,838
It should have been called,

01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,803
Mr. Foley?

1423
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:26,105
Hey, we got a little
proposition for you.

1424
01:17:26,107 --> 01:17:27,174
Can we sit down?

1425
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:29,675
And you can't buy paws

1426
01:17:29,677 --> 01:17:31,746
like you can
some fancy cowboy boots.

01:17:33,214 --> 01:17:35,114
Zephyr Oil & Trading.

1428
01:17:35,116 --> 01:17:36,783
We made a little money
on an oil patch

1429
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:38,851
and now we're ready
to make some vinyl.

1430
01:17:38,853 --> 01:17:40,386
We seen you
there pickin' in Texas

1431
01:17:40,388 --> 01:17:41,854
we put our money on you.

1432
01:17:41,856 --> 01:17:45,424
We believe Blaze Foley
ought to be the headliner

1433
01:17:45,426 --> 01:17:48,628
for our new record label,
Zephyr Records.

1434
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:50,930
Zephyr. Like the wind.
Whoosh.

1435
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:53,099

though, it's more like..

1436
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:54,600
Whooo.

1437
01:17:54,602 --> 01:17:55,935

- That's important.

<i>Let's record a single,
get it on the radio</i>

1439
01:17:58,539 --> 01:17:59,806
then we make an album.

1440
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:01,140
- That's right.
- I'll tell you what..

1441
01:18:01,142 --> 01:18:03,042
We went to Cactus Records,
I didn't see anythin'.

1442
01:18:03,044 --> 01:18:04,509
- Not one record!
- Nothing

1443
01:18:04,511 --> 01:18:06,645
- That's why we're here.
- He knows Willie's sister.

1444
01:18:06,647 --> 01:18:09,314
- It's true.
- Yeah. She's real nice.

1445

01:18:15,421 --> 01:18:16,989
How's that sounding, Blaze?

1449
01:18:16,991 --> 01:18:19,791
Where do I sign?
Show me the dotted line.

1450
01:18:19,793 --> 01:18:22,761
- This is the only line we know.
- Yeah, baby!

1451
01:18:22,763 --> 01:18:24,297
If you want to write a song.

1452
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:26,631
If you want to
really write a song..

1453
01:18:26,633 --> 01:18:29,202
<i>Everyone's gonna tell you
that, uh..</i>

1454
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:31,670
<i>You gotta live
that song.</i>

1455
01:18:31,672 --> 01:18:33,308
But that is not it.

1456
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:38,543
You're gonna have to die
a little.

1457
01:18:38,545 --> 01:18:40,614
You know what my pops
used to always sing?

1458
01:18:42,149 --> 01:18:44,317
He'd sing,

01:19:29,196 --> 01:19:31,595

- Yeah.

1473

So we'll mix it when we get back
from New York?

1477
01:19:41,741 --> 01:19:44,142
- Mmm-hmm.
- Wait a minute. What do you mean, "Mix it?"

1478
01:19:44,144 --> 01:19:47,245
Hey, guys, I gotta go get some sleep.
Maybe for about a week.

He's tryin' to

1483
01:19:53,485 --> 01:19:55,019
- Don't take it personally.
- It'll be fine.

1484
01:19:55,021 --> 01:19:56,354
I know what it is.

1485
01:19:56,356 --> 01:19:58,923
This is a real big deal
for us, man.

1486
01:19:58,925 --> 01:20:00,456
<i>We've been wanting to do this
for a long while</i>

1487
01:20:00,458 --> 01:20:02,693
<i>and it's a real good
experience.</i>

1488
01:20:02,695 --> 01:20:04,962
<i>I couldn't help but think through
the whole recording process</i>

1489
01:20:04,964 --> 01:20:07,131
<i>about the old fable
about the songbird for whom</i>

1490
01:20:07,133 --> 01:20:11,103
which sang the swamp choir.
Are you familiar with that?

1491
01:20:13,739 --> 01:20:15,940
<i>There's this beautiful
songbird</i>

1492
01:20:15,942 --> 01:20:18,909
<i>for whom sang
in this swamp choir.</i>

1493
01:20:18,911 --> 01:20:20,878
<i>He used to rehearse
on this little cypress tree</i>

1494
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,313
<i>and he was up there
rehearsin' one day.</i>

1495
01:20:22,315 --> 01:20:24,982
<i>They had a big swamp recital
coming up.</i>

1496
01:20:24,984 --> 01:20:29,320
He sang a really pretty song and this bullfrog
comes up and starts watching him singing.

1497
01:20:29,322 --> 01:20:34,489
Songbird looked down and said, "Bullfrog,
you liked that song I'm singing?"

1498
01:20:34,491 --> 01:20:37,027
The bullfrog looked up
and said, "Ahhh."

1499
01:20:37,029 --> 01:20:39,796
<i>Songbird said, "Well if
you don't like that song</i>

1500
01:20:39,798 --> 01:20:41,698
<i>I'll sing you
an even better song."</i>

1501
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:43,100
<i>So he sang another song
and yes indeed</i>

1502
01:20:43,102 --> 01:20:45,135
<i>this song was twice as good
as the first one.</i>

1503
01:20:45,137 --> 01:20:47,569
He finished up the song,
he looked down at the bullfrog

1504
01:20:47,571 --> 01:20:52,176
and he said, "Bullfrog,
what you think about that song?"

1505
01:20:52,178 --> 01:20:56,146
Once again the bullfrog looked
up and he said, "Ahhhh."

1506
01:20:57,882 --> 01:21:02,484
<i>Songbird said, "Damn!
I was singing my best song."</i>

1507
01:21:02,486 --> 01:21:06,122
<i>He took a deep breath and he sang one of the
most beautiful songs the frog had ever heard.</i>

1508
01:21:06,124 --> 01:21:08,623
<i>In fact, it was the most beautiful
song the whole swamp had ever heard.</i>

1509
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:12,363
<i>It went on and on and at the end
of it this high note was held.</i>

1510
01:21:12,365 --> 01:21:16,301
<i>The songbird stretched his
neck, his gullet up to the sky.</i>

1511
01:21:17,534 --> 01:21:19,536
And he hit that
final crescendo and..

1512
01:21:21,039 --> 01:21:22,472
<i>Heart gave up.</i>

1513
01:21:22,474 --> 01:21:24,807
Songbird fell dead.

1514
01:21:24,809 --> 01:21:26,309
And as he fell

1515
01:21:26,311 --> 01:21:29,746
that bullfrog looked up
and said, 'Ahhh.'

1516
01:21:29,748 --> 01:21:32,015
And swallowed the songbird.

1517
01:21:32,017 --> 01:21:35,650
<i>The bullfrog felt pretty bad about
that, he wandered over to the river.</i>

1518
01:21:35,652 --> 01:21:38,690
<i>And he went to see the band leader,
which was a big old fat raccoon.</i>

1519
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:46,029
He said, "Hey, man, I'd like to sing 'The
Revival Of The Night' if that's possible?"

1520
01:21:46,031 --> 01:21:49,000
<i>The raccoon looked him up and
down and said, "Bullfrog..</i>

1521
01:21:50,402 --> 01:21:53,202
<i>...can you even sing?"</i>

1522
01:21:53,204 --> 01:21:57,540
The bullfrog said, "Nope,
but I gots it in me!"

1523
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:07,949
Well, that's the strangest damn
joke I ever heard.

1524
01:22:07,951 --> 01:22:09,718
<i>Gotta say, Blaze,
we're pumped, man.</i>

1525
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,187
- Hell, yeah!
- Whoo!

1526
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:14,655
Looking good, looking forward to
the gig in New York.

Blaze was in New York City</i>

1567
01:24:45,408 --> 01:24:48,375
Every time I do those solos..

1568
01:24:48,377 --> 01:24:51,277

weird Spanish fly or something..

happens to me all the time.

1575
01:25:06,061 --> 01:25:09,295

waking nightmare.

<i>Let's say you're doing a gig.</i>

1577

01:25:12,433 --> 01:25:15,534

standing back there.

01:25:26,214 --> 01:25:28,147
he starts to move
a little bit closer.

1584

right up to the stage, huh?

and you know,
playin' a little bit

1605
01:26:48,028 --> 01:26:50,030

1680
01:32:18,352 --> 01:32:19,385
<i>Okay.</i>

1681
01:32:19,387 --> 01:32:20,419
And I'm here
for three more nights

1682
01:32:20,421 --> 01:32:23,355
so you can come by every night.

1683
01:32:23,357 --> 01:32:25,091
I'm happy to see you.

1684
01:32:25,093 --> 01:32:27,894
- Me too.
- Thanks for comin'.

1685
01:32:27,896 --> 01:32:29,595
- And good luck tonight.
- Thank you.

1686
01:32:29,597 --> 01:32:31,430
Let me hear
that line one time.

1687
01:32:31,432 --> 01:32:33,699
Asshole!

1688
01:32:33,701 --> 01:32:36,568
A professional actress
right there.

1689
01:32:36,570 --> 01:32:38,406
Asshole!

1690
01:32:52,253 --> 01:32:55,220
Why do you suppose
she didn't come to the gig

1691
01:32:55,222 --> 01:32:57,389
but she came to say hello?

1692
01:32:57,391 --> 01:33:01,360
I told her I had a record coming
out w... with Willie Nelson.

1693
01:33:01,362 --> 01:33:03,364
She said "That's great."

1694
01:33:04,699 --> 01:33:07,835
Why the fuck would she not
come out to the gig, man?

1695
01:33:08,636 --> 01:33:11,269
This next number is called

1696
01:33:11,271 --> 01:33:14,338
"My Existential Journey

1699
01:33:22,382 --> 01:33:26,719
And on, on, on the side note,
it tells her to call, "Son up?"

1700
01:33:26,721 --> 01:33:29,922
Why would she tell me
she was coming and not come?

1701
01:33:31,625 --> 01:33:35,194
I keep gettin'
these long postcards

1702
01:33:35,196 --> 01:33:37,461
from my mother.

1703
01:33:37,463 --> 01:33:40,631
And she keeps saying,
"Blaze Foley, Blaze Foley

1704
01:33:40,633 --> 01:33:43,936
Blaze Foley, when you
gonna get a regular job?"

1705
01:33:43,938 --> 01:33:47,505
Why would she tell me
she was coming and not come?

my wind paid.. ♪

<i>Buddy, you, you
got women trouble.</i>

1709
01:34:17,604 --> 01:34:19,003
Hmm.

1710
01:34:19,005 --> 01:34:21,839
But I've got the cure for that.
I got the cure for that.

1711
01:34:21,841 --> 01:34:23,074
Mmm.

One, two, three.
One, two, three.

01:34:36,089 --> 01:34:37,387
Where is he?

1714
01:34:37,389 --> 01:34:40,858
Well, you havin'
a good time?

Where's that little shit?

Hey!

1717
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:49,000
White trash fucktard!

1718
01:34:49,002 --> 01:34:50,432
<i>You don't you get it, do you?</i>

1719
01:34:50,434 --> 01:34:52,970
We were your shot.
You fucked us!

1720
01:34:52,972 --> 01:34:54,337
We were workin' for you.

1721
01:34:54,339 --> 01:34:56,107
<i>Think we're goin'
to pay this bill?</i>

1722
01:34:56,109 --> 01:34:58,976
You not only just
shot yourself in the foot

1723
01:34:58,978 --> 01:35:00,577
it ricocheted on the floor

1724
01:35:00,579 --> 01:35:02,511
and hit you
in the head, dummy!

1725
01:35:02,513 --> 01:35:05,382
<i>Hey, but don't worry about us.
Yeah, don't worry.</i>

fuck our girlfriends,
fuck our wives

1728
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:13,890
and never think about your
hillbilly ass ever again.

1729
01:35:13,892 --> 01:35:16,660
You're gonna keep drinkin'
and thinkin' about this moment

1730
01:35:16,662 --> 01:35:17,928
for the rest of your life.

1731
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:19,562
<i>Go away.</i>

1732
01:35:19,564 --> 01:35:22,300
Hey, hey. What... what?

1733
01:35:22,302 --> 01:35:24,634
<i>Hey, you know what?</i>

1734
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:28,905
- You coulda been a star, cocksucker.
- <i>Mean.</i>

1735
01:35:28,907 --> 01:35:30,407
But you just wanted to be cool.

1736
01:35:30,409 --> 01:35:32,909
You just wanted
to drink Tequila Sunrises

1737
01:35:32,911 --> 01:35:34,644
until our company went under.

1738
01:35:34,646 --> 01:35:37,247
Guess what?
Ding, ding. You win!

1739
01:35:37,249 --> 01:35:40,083
- Prize is yours, boy.
- <i>Hey, fellas, hang on a minute.</i>

1740
01:35:40,085 --> 01:35:41,483
You're the loser
you always wanted to be.

1741
01:35:41,485 --> 01:35:44,221
Let me hold on. Let me just
ask you one question.

1742
01:35:44,223 --> 01:35:45,487
Is that how y'all do business?

1743
01:35:45,489 --> 01:35:47,757
You just go around drillin'
holes in the ground

1744
01:35:47,759 --> 01:35:49,226
<i>and thinking you might
get lucky?</i>

1745
01:35:49,228 --> 01:35:50,927
<i>And tie us a bone.</i>

1746
01:35:52,429 --> 01:35:55,364
See, what you fail
to realize is that

1747
01:35:55,366 --> 01:35:57,834
we've got this thing down
to a science.

1748
01:35:57,836 --> 01:36:00,804
You know what I mean? Like all
this, this is our crack team.

1749
01:36:00,806 --> 01:36:04,707

if you have a glass or two
before dinner.

1761
01:36:37,242 --> 01:36:38,807
And nobody's gonna say that
youse were outta line.

1762
01:36:38,809 --> 01:36:40,075
That's right.

1763
01:36:40,077 --> 01:36:41,643
But if you're a gal
that likes to drink

1764

Remember when I told you
about my life

1773
01:37:14,011 --> 01:37:15,978
with my sweetheart
in the tree in the woods?

1774
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:17,281
Yeah.

<i>It was a.. It was a magical time.

<i>Beautiful girl.</i>

01:37:28,457 --> 01:37:30,559
Now look who's come to town?

<i>He's right on time.</i>

1779
01:37:33,662 --> 01:37:34,963
<i>First of the month.</i>

1780
01:37:34,965 --> 01:37:36,898
<i>More dependable

Hangin' with these

<i>This is my damn house.</i>

1783

This is my house.
You know why I'm here.

1784
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:46,573
- How do you do to you too.
- Hey, old mule.

1785
01:37:46,575 --> 01:37:49,444
Hey, man. That's no way to treat
your old man.

1786
01:37:49,446 --> 01:37:50,845
<i>Is this him, Concho?</i>

1787
01:37:50,847 --> 01:37:53,448
First of the month every month
into his arm.

1788
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:56,150
His mother was addicted to that
stuff and he was born like that

1789
01:37:56,152 --> 01:37:58,052
<i>And I love him.
You know, that's my son.</i>

1790

Where the money here, pops?

Hey, man, I happen

1802
01:38:23,246 --> 01:38:25,947
You love him? You don't even
fuckin' know this old man.

1803
01:38:25,949 --> 01:38:27,680
Bet you he ain't tell ya

1804
01:38:27,682 --> 01:38:29,817
<i>Bet you, he ain't tell you

1805
01:38:29,819 --> 01:38:31,853
Talkin' about you love this
old man. You don't know shit.

1806
01:38:31,855 --> 01:38:33,586
Get these fuckin' peckerwoods
off my porch.

1807
01:38:33,588 --> 01:38:35,554
Shut your mouth! Shut your
mouth! Shut your mouth!

1808
01:38:35,556 --> 01:38:37,125
- What the fuck, man?
- Barry! Barry.

1809
01:38:37,127 --> 01:38:38,657
It's a screwdriver.

1810
01:38:38,659 --> 01:38:40,693
Just 'cause you big,
don't mean you can't fall.

1811
01:38:40,695 --> 01:38:42,628

01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:44,965
- <i>Shut the fuck up.</i>
- <i>Shut your bitch up, punk.</i>

1813
01:38:44,967 --> 01:38:46,900
Hey, you can't talk
to Elise like that.

1814
01:38:46,902 --> 01:38:48,601
Just give me the money, pops,
and I'm gone.

1815
01:38:48,603 --> 01:38:49,668
Townes, run and get the car.

1816
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:51,105
Blaze, this is not your problem.

1817
01:38:51,107 --> 01:38:53,509
Screwdriver?
You got your screwdriver?

1818
01:38:54,709 --> 01:38:56,709
- Okay, screw driver!
- Hey!

1819
01:38:58,546 --> 01:39:00,080
Hey! Hey!

1820
01:39:00,082 --> 01:39:01,781
- Townes, where's your phone now?
- <i>Don't call the police.</i>

1821
01:39:01,783 --> 01:39:03,483

01:39:03,485 --> 01:39:04,851
<i>Don't call the police!</i>

1823
01:39:08,589 --> 01:39:10,393
Barry, get outta there!

1824
01:39:13,228 --> 01:39:14,760
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1825
01:39:14,762 --> 01:39:16,396
<i>Is that the end of that reel?</i>

1826
01:39:16,398 --> 01:39:18,564
Any chance you got another
wheel of celluloid over there

1827
01:39:18,566 --> 01:39:21,234
you want to slap on?
It's only my life's work.

1828
01:39:21,236 --> 01:39:22,601
Sorry, Blaze, we're done.

1829
01:39:22,603 --> 01:39:24,670
Okay.

Well, thank you very, very much.

My name is Cinnamon.

1838
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:47,227
Like the bun?

1839
01:39:47,229 --> 01:39:49,396
Now, here's to you, big dog.

1840
01:39:49,398 --> 01:39:51,830
You recorded 24 tracks
in two hours.

1841
01:39:51,832 --> 01:39:54,401
- Goddamn.
- You're a goddamn hero.

1842
01:39:54,403 --> 01:39:55,802
- You're a legend.
- Cheers.

1843
01:39:57,637 --> 01:40:00,672
Look here, I'm on the wagon and
my friend's gonna buy me a guitar

and this cat called the world
has got a .22 squirrel rifle

1956

I'm smart enough

2041
01:52:57,341 --> 01:52:59,408
But I don't know

Like, maybe I don't know
how to dance

2044
